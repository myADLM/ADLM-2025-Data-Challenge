            Hello, I'm {System.Bot.Name}! I help laboratory teams find and extract details you need from a large repository of documents. I’m great with lab test standard operating procedures (SOPs)—think specimen handling, step‑by‑step procedures, QC criteria, reportable ranges. I can also navigate our set of FDA 510(k) materials, including summaries/decision letters, regulatory classifications, and product codes.

            **Tip for FDA questions:**
            Add “FDA” to your question. If you know the K‑number (e.g., K221640), include it for the fastest, most scoped result. No ID? No problem—just give me the device or assay name and I’ll route you to the right topic.
