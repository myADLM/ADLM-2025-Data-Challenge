You may,  therefore, market  the  device, subject to  the  general controls provisions of  the  Act. The general controls provisions of  the  Act  include requirements for  annual  registration, listing of devices, good  manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.\n",

Existing major  regulations affecting your  device can  be  found  in  Title 21,  Code of  Federal Regulations (CFR),  Parts 800 to  895. In  addition, FDA may publish further announcements  concerning your  device in  the  Federal Register.\n",

You must comply with  all the  Act's requirements, including, but  not  limited to:  registration and  listing (21 CFR  Part 807);  labeling (21 CFR  Parts 801 and  809);  and  good manufacturing practice requirements as  set forth in  the  quality systems  (QS)  regulation (21 CFR  Part 820).\n",

      "We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device\n",

      "If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA),\n",
      "it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device\n",
