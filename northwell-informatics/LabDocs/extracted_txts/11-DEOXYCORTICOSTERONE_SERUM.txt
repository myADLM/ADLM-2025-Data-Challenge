Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of 11-
Deoxycorticosterone, Serum Testing
1. Purpose:
• To provide a detailed and standardized protocol for the analysis
and reporting of 11-deoxycorticosterone levels in serum samples.
• Ensure consistency, accuracy, and reliability of test results.
1. Scope:
• This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel involved in the
analytical process of 11-deoxycorticosterone testing in clinical
serum samples.
1. Responsibilities:
• Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing
the analysis and ensuring that all steps are followed according to
this SOP.
• It is the responsibility of lab supervisors to ensure this procedure
is adhered to and that any deviations are documented and
reviewed.
1. Definitions:
• 11-Deoxycorticosterone: A steroid hormone produced by the
adrenal cortex and is a precursor to corticosteroids.
• Serum: The liquid component of blood obtained after removal of
clotting factors and cells.
1. Equipment, Reagents, and Materials:
• High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) or Liquid
Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).
• 11-Deoxycorticosterone standards for calibration.
• Internal standards.
• Specific reagents and solvents as per manufacturer's protocol for
sample preparation.
• Sample vials, pipettes, and protective laboratory equipment.
1. Procedure: A) Sample Preparation:
◦ Use only properly labeled and accessioned serum samples.
◦ Thaw frozen samples at room temperature. Do not heat.
◦ Centrifuge samples at 3000rpm for 10 minutes to remove
any particulate matter.
◦ Aliquot an appropriate amount of serum, typically 0.5-1 mL,
into sample vials.
B) Calibration and Quality Controls: - Prepare a calibration curve
using 11-Deoxycorticosterone standards. - Include internal standards
to account for variability. - Run quality control samples (low, medium,
and high concentrations) along with patient samples to ensure assay
performance.
C) Chromatographic Analysis: - Set up the HPLC or LC-MS/MS
system following manufacturer’s guidelines. - Ensure the column is
properly conditioned. - Load the prepared serum samples and
calibrators into the autosampler. - Run the chromatographic program:
- Initial gradient conditions (if applicable). - Injection volume and flow
rate settings. - Ensure all data acquisition parameters are set
correctly.
D) Data Analysis: - Use appropriate software for data acquisition and
analysis. - Integrate peaks and match retention times to standards. -
Use the calibration curve to calculate the concentration of 11-
Deoxycorticosterone in serum samples. - Validate the run by
checking that quality control samples are within the acceptable
range.
E) Reporting Results: - Transcribe results into the Laboratory
Information System (LIS) with proper units (e.g., ng/mL). - Review all
data for quality and consistency. - Validate and verify the results as
per laboratory protocols. - Document any discrepancies or deviations
in the run log.
1. Quality Control:
• Run quality control samples with each batch of patient samples.
• Document any quality control failures and repeat the analysis if
necessary.
• Routine maintenance and calibration of the HPLC or LC-MS/MS
should be performed to ensure optimal operation.
1. Reference Intervals:
• Reference intervals for 11-Deoxycorticosterone should be based
on validated literature or established laboratory data.
1. Method Limitations:
• Potential interferences from other steroids should be considered.
• Ensure adherence to manufacturer's protocols for reagent
handling and instrument maintenance.
1. References:
• Manufacturer’s protocols for HPLC or LC-MS/MS setup and
operation.
• Latest clinical guidelines on the interpretation of 11-
Deoxycorticosterone levels.
1. Document Control:
• This SOP is subject to review and updating as per laboratory
quality management standards.
• Version control should be maintained, and changes documented.
By implementing this SOP, we aim to ensure the precision, accuracy,
and reliability of 11-deoxycorticosterone, serum testing, thus
providing critical information for clinical diagnostics and patient
management.
