Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of 11-
Deoxycortisol, Serum
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for the analytical phase of generating results
for 11-Deoxycortisol in serum samples, ensuring accurate and
reliable test results that comply with clinical laboratory standards.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory staff are responsible for
conducting the analysis, documenting the results, and ensuring that
all quality control measures are adhered to.
1. SPECIMEN
Preferred/acceptable:
• Collect serum samples in a red-top tube (no gel).
• Serum samples should be centrifuged and aliquoted within 2
hours of collection.
Unacceptable:
• Specimens collected in tubes containing anticoagulants such as
EDTA, citrate, or heparin.
• Samples not properly labeled with patient identification, collection
date, and time.
• Specimens showing evidence of hemolysis or lipemia.
Sample stability:
• Serum samples can be stored at room temperature (20-25°C) for
up to 24 hours.
• For longer storage, refrigerate at 2-8°C for up to 72 hours or
freeze at -20°C for up to 6 months.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Spectrophotometer or a relevant analytical instrument
• Reagents for 11-Deoxycortisol assay
• Calibrators and controls specific to 11-Deoxycortisol
measurement
• Pipettes and centrifuge
• Aliquot tubes
1. PROCEDURE
Pre-Analysis:
• Ensure the spectrophotometer or analytical instrument is properly
calibrated.
• Prepare reagents, calibrators, and controls according to
manufacturer instructions.
• Verify that the serum sample meets the acceptance criteria
(volume, labeling, absence of hemolysis or lipemia).
Analysis:
1. Perform a calibration of the analytical instrument using the
provided calibrators.
2. Run quality control samples at the beginning of the analysis to
validate the system's performance.
3. Pipette the appropriate volume of the serum sample into the
designated aliquot tube.
4. Add reagents to the serum sample as specified in the assay kit
instructions.
5. Incubate the sample at the specified temperature and time as
per the assay kit.
6. Measure the absorbance or response using the
spectrophotometer or relevant analytical instrument.
7. Record the readings and process the data using the instrument
software.
Post-Analysis:
• Review the data for quality control compliance.
• Verify that the quality control samples fall within the expected
ranges. If not, troubleshoot and repeat the analysis.
• Ensure all results are accurately documented in the laboratory
information system (LIS).
1. QUALITY CONTROL
Internal Quality Control:
• Run three levels of control (low, medium, high) with each batch of
samples to ensure the assay's accuracy and precision.
• Document all control results. If controls fail, do not report patient
results until the issue is resolved.
External Quality Control:
• Participate in relevant proficiency testing programs and document
the results as required.
Calibration and Validation:
• Perform calibration verification annually or after major instrument
maintenance.
• Validate new reagent lots by comparing results with previous lots
using patient samples.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
Results are automatically transmitted to the LIS and must be
reviewed and verified by the technologist.
Reference Intervals: Refer to site-specific reference intervals for 11-
Deoxycortisol.
Critical Results: Follow site-specific guidelines for reporting critical
values. Document any actions taken in response to critical results.
Documentation:
• Maintain all records of calibration, QC, and patient results for
regulatory compliance.
• Ensure documentation includes patient identification, specimen
details, dates, and technologist initials.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the manufacturer’s instructions for limitations related to the
analytical method, including potential interferences and sensitivity.
1. SAFETY AND COMPLIANCE
Follow all laboratory safety protocols, including the use of personal
protective equipment (PPE), proper disposal of biohazard materials,
and adherence to chemical handling procedures.
