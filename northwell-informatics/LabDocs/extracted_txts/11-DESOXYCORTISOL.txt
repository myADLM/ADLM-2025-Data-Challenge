Protocol for Analytical Phase of Generating Results for 11-
Deoxycortisol
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to outline the steps involved in the
analytical phase of generating results for 11-Deoxycortisol in a CLIA-
certified laboratory. This protocol ensures accuracy, consistency, and
reliability of results for clinical use.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
All laboratory scientists and technologists involved in the analysis are
responsible for adhering to the guidelines outlined in this protocol.
Supervisors are responsible for the oversight and validation of the
results.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Preferred Specimen:
• Serum or plasma from a blood sample collected in SST (serum
separator tube) or EDTA/heparinized plasma.
Specimen Stability:
• Serum/plasma: Stable for up to 24 hours at room temperature
(15-25°C), 72 hours at 4°C, and up to 6 months at -20°C.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens that are hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric.
• Specimens collected in sodium fluoride or oxalate vacutainers.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Required Materials:
• Centrifuge
• Refrigerated centrifuge (if applicable)
• Pipettes and disposables
• Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) system
• 11-Deoxycortisol calibration standards and quality controls
Reagents:
• Mobile phase solvents (e.g., acetonitrile, water, methanol)
• Internal standard (e.g., deuterated 11-Deoxycortisol)
• Extraction solvents (e.g., ethyl acetate, hexane)
5. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation of Specimen:
1. Collect blood sample and allow to clot (if using SST) for 30
minutes at room temperature.
2. Centrifuge at 1500 x g for 10 minutes.
3. Transfer serum or plasma into a labeled polypropylene aliquot
tube.
4. Store at 4°C or freeze at -20°C if not processing immediately.
B) Extraction of 11-Deoxycortisol:
1. Add internal standard to each sample aliquot.
2. Mix sample with extraction solvent in a ratio of 1:1 (v:v).
3. Vortex briefly and centrifuge at 2500 x g for 10 minutes.
4. Collect the organic phase and evaporate under nitrogen to
dryness.
5. Reconstitute the residue in mobile phase solvent for LC-MS/MS
analysis.
C) LC-MS/MS Analysis:
1. Prepare calibration standards and quality control samples.
2. Set up LC-MS/MS system with appropriate column and mobile
phase conditions.
3. Inject samples, standards, and controls into the LC-MS/MS
system.
4. Utilize appropriate ion pairs for detection of 11-Deoxycortisol
and internal standard.
5. Record retention times and response ratios.
D) Quantification:
1. Generate calibration curve using calibration standards.
2. Calculate the concentration of 11-Deoxycortisol in each sample
based on the calibration curve.
3. Ensure all controls fall within acceptable ranges.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform analysis of three levels of quality control with each batch.
• Acceptable limits for quality control are set based on the
manufacturer’s recommendations and verified by the laboratory.
• If quality control fails, repeat analysis or troubleshoot the LC-MS/
MS system.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results are automatically transmitted to the Laboratory
Information System (LIS) and reviewed by the technologist.
• Verify results before releasing to ensure values are consistent
with quality control and patient conditions.
• Report any critical values following the laboratory's critical values
protocol.
