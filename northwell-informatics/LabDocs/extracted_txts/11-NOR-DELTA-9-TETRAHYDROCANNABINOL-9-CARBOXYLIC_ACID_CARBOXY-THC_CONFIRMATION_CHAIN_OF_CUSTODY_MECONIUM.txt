Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
1. PURPOSE
This procedure is designed to delineate the steps for the confirmation
of 11-NOR-DELTA-9-TETRAHYDROCANNABINOL-9-CARBOXYLIC
ACID (Carboxy-THC) in meconium, ensuring a proper chain of
custody for forensic purposes. It aims to provide reliable and
accurate results, consistent documentation, and clear accountability
for specimen handling and analysis.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the
confirmation analysis, maintaining proper chain of custody, and
documenting all steps as stated in this protocol.
• Supervisors are responsible for the oversight and validation of the
procedures and results, including any corrective actions required.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND REJECTION CRITERIA
Specimen:
• Preferred/Acceptable: Fresh meconium specimens collected
within hours of birth.
• Minimum volume required: 10 g
• Storage: Specimens should be stored at -20°C and should remain
frozen until analysis.
Unacceptable Specimen Conditions:
• Specimens that are improperly stored or transported.
• Specimens that have no collection date/time indicated on the
container or requisition.
• Specimens insufficient in volume (<10 g).
• Specimens contaminated with foreign material.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) or Liquid
Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) for
confirmation
• Extraction solvents (e.g., methanol, acetonitrile)
• Solid phase extraction cartridges
• Certified reference standards for Carboxy-THC
• Calibration solutions
• Chain of custody documentation forms
• Labeled specimen containers and transport bags
1. PROCEDURE
Chain of Custody Documentation:
• Begin chain of custody from specimen collection.
• Assign unique identifier to specimen and log all transfers of
possession.
• Use chain of custody forms to document the date, time, and
individuals handling the specimen.
Sample Preparation:
1. Thaw meconium specimen.
2. Weigh an aliquot (minimum 2 g).
3. Add appropriate internal standards.
4. Homogenize the specimen with extraction solvent in a
mechanical homogenizer.
5. Centrifuge to separate solid and liquid phases.
6. Use solid phase extraction cartridges to purify the analyte.
7. Elute analytes from cartridges with solvent into labeled vials.
Analysis by GC-MS or LC-MS/MS:
1. Calibrate instrument using certified reference standards for
Carboxy-THC.
2. Run quality control samples, including a blank, a negative
control, and a positive control.
3. Inject purified sample extract into instrument.
4. Analyze for the presence of Carboxy-THC.
5. Validate against control samples and reference standards.
Quality Control and Validation:
• Ensure all instrument calibrations fall within manufacturer’s
specified ranges.
• Verify that quality control samples meet reference criteria.
• Troubleshoot any deviations and reanalyze samples if necessary.
Reporting Results:
• Confirm the presence or absence of Carboxy-THC.
• Document results: include specimen identifier, quantitative values,
and analyst’s initials.
• Transmit verified results to Laboratory Information System (LIS)/
electronic health record (EHR).
1. DATA MANAGEMENT AND DOCUMENTATION
Documentation:
• Maintain thorough logs of all steps, including analysis dates,
times, and personnel.
• Store chain of custody forms and analysis logs in secure,
accessible locations.
Data Management:
• Input results into LIS/EHR ensuring proper review and verification.
• Back up electronic data regularly in accordance with laboratory
SOPs.
Corrective Action:
• If discrepancies occur, document the issue and notify a supervisor
promptly.
• Outline and execute corrective measures and reanalyze
specimens when necessary.
