Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Analytical Phase for 11-
NOR-DELTA-9-TETRAHYDROCANNABINOL-9-CARBOXYLIC
ACID (CARBOXY-THC) CONFIRMATION IN MECONIUM
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is to
provide a detailed protocol for the confirmation of Carboxy-THC in
meconium samples, including the analytical steps required to
generate reliable and accurate results following sample preparation
and extraction.
1. RESPONSIBILITIES
• It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory personnel to
follow the procedures outlined in this SOP and ensure quality
control measures are adhered to throughout the analytical
process.
• The laboratory supervisor is responsible for reviewing and
validating results, troubleshooting analytical issues, and ensuring
proper documentation of the analytical phase.
1. DEFINITIONS
• Carboxy-THC: 11-NOR-DELTA-9-
TETRAHYDROCANNABINOL-9-CARBOXYLIC ACID, a
metabolite of THC.
• Meconium: The first stool of an infant, which is typically collected
to assess exposure to substances during pregnancy.
1. EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS
• Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) or Liquid
Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)
• Analytical balance
• Centrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Specimen containers
• Pipettes and tips
• Carboxy-THC standard
• Calibrated glassware
• Internal standard solution
Reagents:
• Organic solvents (Methanol, Acetonitrile)
• Buffer solutions
• HPLC grade water
• Extraction media (e.g., solid phase extraction cartridges)
Supplies:
• Gloves
• Lab coat
• Safety glasses
• Labels
1. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation of Calibration Standards and Controls:
• Prepare calibration standards ranging from 0 to the maximum
threshold concentration of Carboxy-THC in meconium. Use HPLC
grade solvent for dilution.
• Prepare quality control samples at low, medium, and high
concentrations.
B) Sample Preparation:
• Isolation from Meconium:
1. Weigh 1 gram of meconium and transfer it into a labeled
centrifuge tube.
2. Add 10 mL of methanol to the tube and vortex thoroughly for
1 minute.
3. Centrifuge the sample at 3000 RPM for 10 minutes.
4. Transfer the supernatant to another labeled tube.
• Solid Phase Extraction (SPE) Protocol:
1. Condition the SPE column with 5 mL of methanol followed
by 5 mL of HPLC-grade water.
2. Load the sample onto the SPE column.
3. Wash the column with 5 mL of HPLC-grade water followed
by 5 mL of methanol.
4. Elute Carboxy-THC with 5 mL of acetonitrile into a clean,
labeled tube.
C) Sample Analysis:
• Instrument Setup and Calibration:
1. Set up the GC-MS or LC-MS/MS instrument according to
manufacturer instructions and ensure it is properly
calibrated.
2. Inject calibration standards and establish the calibration
curve.
• Sample Injection:
1. Use an appropriate volume (e.g., 10 μL) of the extracted
sample for injection into the GC-MS or LC-MS/MS.
2. Record the retention time and peak area for Carboxy-THC.
3. Run quality control samples between every 10 test samples
to ensure ongoing accuracy.
D) Data Analysis and Result Generation:
• Analyze the chromatogram and integrate the peak corresponding
to Carboxy-THC.
• Compare the sample peak areas and retention times to those of
the calibration standards.
• Convert the peak area data to concentration values using the
calibration curve.
• Verify the results against quality control standards.
• Document results on the test report form.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Use two levels of internal quality control for each batch of
samples.
• In case of QC failure, halt analysis and investigate the cause.
Retest samples once the issue is resolved.
• Document all QC measures and corrective actions taken.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Once validated, results should be accurately entered into the
Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Ensure all results include specimen identification, concentration of
Carboxy-THC, and any relevant comments regarding sample
integrity or analytical issues.
• Follow site-specific reporting guidelines.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Refer to established cutoff levels for Carboxy-THC positivity as
per laboratory guidelines.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Susceptibility to contamination: ensure strict adherence to clean
procedures.
• Possible matrix effects due to meconium components affecting
extraction efficiency.
• Limitations described in the instrument and reagent inserts should
be observed.
