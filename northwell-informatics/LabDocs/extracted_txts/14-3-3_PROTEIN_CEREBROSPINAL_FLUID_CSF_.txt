Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for 14-3-3 Protein in Cerebrospinal Fluid
(CSF)
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the procedure for the analysis of 14-3-3 protein in
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to ensure accurate and timely results.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory staff responsible for the
analysis of 14-3-3 protein in CSF samples.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all designated staff to follow this procedure
and ensure the accuracy and reliability of test results. The supervisor
must review and validate the results and monitor compliance with the
SOP.
4. DEFINITION
14-3-3 protein is a biomarker used in the diagnosis of prion diseases,
such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD).
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENT
Preferred/Acceptable Specimen:
• 1-2 mL of freshly collected CSF in a sterile container, preferably
obtained via lumbar puncture.
• Specimens should be transported to the lab immediately. If
immediate transport is not possible, store the sample at 2-8°C,
but analyze within 72 hours.
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Specimens that are clotted, hemolyzed, or contaminated.
• Specimens received after 72 hours of collection or stored under
inappropriate conditions.
6. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• ELISA or Western Blot kit specific for 14-3-3 protein detection
• Microcentrifuge
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Refrigerated centrifuge
• Sterile microtubes
• Sterile sample containers
• Reagent blank, positive and negative controls specific for 14-3-3
protein detection
• Plate reader (for ELISA)
7. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation:
1. Prepare the workspace and ensure all necessary reagents,
controls, and equipment are available and calibrated.
B. Sample Processing:
1. Centrifuge the CSF sample at 1,500 g for 10 minutes at 4°C to
remove cells and debris.
2. Carefully transfer the supernatant to a sterile microtube without
disturbing the pellet.
C. Assay Procedure - ELISA:
1. Allow reagents and samples to reach room temperature.
2. Prepare the ELISA plate according to the manufacturer’s
instructions, including reagent blank, positive and negative
controls.
3. Add 100 μL of each CSF sample, controls, and standards to the
appropriate wells.
4. Follow the ELISA kit protocol, adding the appropriate volumes
and types of reagents and substrates.
5. Incubate the plate as per the kit instructions.
6. Measure the absorbance using the plate reader at the specified
wavelength.
D. Assay Procedure - Western Blot (If Applicable):
1. Mix 20 μL of each CSF sample with an equal volume of sample
buffer.
2. Load the samples, along with the molecular weight marker and
positive controls, on the SDS-PAGE gel.
3. Perform electrophoresis and transfer the proteins to a
nitrocellulose or PVDF membrane.
4. Block the membrane with 5% non-fat dry milk in TBS-T.
5. Incubate the membrane with 14-3-3 protein-specific primary
antibody, followed by HRP-conjugated secondary antibody.
6. Develop the blot using chemiluminescence reagents and detect
the signal using an imaging system.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Include positive and negative controls with each batch of
samples tested.
2. Validate each new lot of ELISA or Western Blot kits by
performing a calibration with known standards.
3. If quality control results fall outside the acceptable range, do not
release any patient results and investigate the cause of the
failure. Repeat the assay if necessary.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Record the absorbance values (for ELISA) or bands intensities
(for Western Blot) and calculate the concentration of 14-3-3
protein in the CSF samples.
2. Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS) and
review for accuracy.
3. Verify and interpret results according to established reference
ranges and clinical guidelines.
4. Critical results must be reported to the requesting physician
immediately.
10. METHOD LIMITATIONS
1. Hemolyzed or contaminated samples may yield inaccurate
results.
2. Assay sensitivity and specificity depends on the quality of the
reagents and adherence to the protocol.
3. Cross-reactivity with other proteins or substances in CSF
should be considered during interpretation.

detection in CSF.
12. REVIEW AND REVISION
This SOP shall be reviewed annually or when new methodology or
technologies are introduced. Any changes will be documented and
communicated to all relevant personnel.
