Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analysis of 17-
HYDROXYPREGNENOLONE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this procedure is to delineate the
steps for the accurate and precise determination of 17-
Hydroxypregnenolone in serum samples. This hormone is
measured to assist in the diagnosis and management of certain
congenital adrenal hyperplasia, adrenal tumors, and endocrine
disorders.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory staff and technologists are responsible for
performing the assay.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring compliance with this
SOP and for addressing any deviations.
1. DEFINITION 17-Hydroxypregnenolone is a steroid hormone
involved in the biosynthesis of other steroids, including cortisol
and sex hormones.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred Sample: 2 mL of serum separated from a red-top or
gold-top (serum separator) tube.
• Unacceptable Sample: Hemolyzed, icteric, or lipemic samples.
• Specimens should be collected and properly labeled following
standard phlebotomy procedures.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Immunoassay analyzer capable of performing the
chemiluminescence or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(ELISA)
• Specific assay kits for the quantitative measurement of 17-
Hydroxypregnenolone
• Calibrators and controls
• Pipettes and tips
• Centrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Laboratory Timer
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
1. CALIBRATION AND MAINTENANCE
• The immunoassay analyzer must be calibrated according to the
manufacturer’s guidelines before performing the assay.
• Calibration is to be performed with each new lot of reagents and
once every 30 days.
• Perform routine maintenance on equipment according to the
laboratory policy and record all maintenance activities.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include at least two levels of quality control (QC) material with
each assay run (typically, low and high levels).
• QC materials should be treated in the same manner as patient
specimens.
• QC results must be within the established ranges before
proceeding with the test run.
• Document all QC results and take appropriate corrective action if
controls fail.
1. PROCEDURE A) Sample Handling and Preparation:
2. Allow the collected blood to clot at room temperature for 30
minutes.
3. Centrifuge the sample at 1500 g for 10 minutes to separate the
serum.
4. Aliquot the serum into a labeled polypropylene tube.
5. Store the serum at 2-8°C if the assay is to be performed within
48 hours. For long-term storage, freeze at -20°C or below.
B) Assay Procedure:
1. Bring all reagents, samples, and controls to room temperature.
2. Prepare reagents, calibrators, and controls as required by the
assay kit instructions.
3. Pipette the required volume of each calibrator, control, and
sample into the designated wells of the assay plate.
4. Follow the specific assay protocol for incubation times, washing
steps, and substrate reaction.
5. Measure the absorbance or chemiluminescent signal using the
immunoassay analyzer.
C) Calculations:
1. Construct a standard curve by plotting the absorbance or signal
against the concentration of the calibrators.
2. Determine the concentration of 17-Hydroxypregnenolone in the
patient samples by interpolation from the standard curve.
3. Ensure all sample results are reported in the appropriate units
(e.g., ng/dL).
4. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results are reviewed and verified by the technologist before entry
into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• All abnormal or critical values must be communicated to the
relevant clinician following the laboratory’s critical value policy.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• The reference interval for 17-Hydroxypregnenolone concentration
should be established based on method validation studies or
provided by the assay kit manufacturer. Typical adult reference
intervals are <100 ng/dL, but these can vary.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolysis, lipemia, and icterus can interfere with the assay and
should be avoided.
• Certain medications and clinical conditions may affect 17-
Hydroxypregnenolone levels. Interpret results considering clinical
context and medication history.

1. DOCUMENT REVISION HISTORY
• Include version number, effective date, approval signatures, and
summary of changes for maintaining the current SOP.
By following this SOP, laboratory personnel ensure the accurate and
reliable measurement of 17-Hydroxypregnenolone in serum, which
supports diagnostic and therapeutic decision-making.
