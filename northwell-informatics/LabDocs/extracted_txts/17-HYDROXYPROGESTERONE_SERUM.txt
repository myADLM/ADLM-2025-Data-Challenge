Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase Protocol for Generating Results for Serum 17-
Hydroxyprogesterone
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the procedure for analyzing serum samples for 17-
Hydroxyprogesterone using designated laboratory equipment and
instrumentation. The aim is to ensure accurate and reliable results
that can be used to support clinical decision-making.
Responsibility:
• It is the responsibility of all trained laboratory personnel to perform
the analysis according to the procedures specified in this
document.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring compliance with this
protocol and addressing issues related to the quality of test
results.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STORAGE
Specimen Type:
• Serum collected in a red top or serum separation tube (SST).
• Ensure the specimen is free from hemolysis, lipemia, and icterus
which may interfere with the analysis.
Collection and Storage:
• After collection, allow blood to clot for 30 minutes to 1 hour at
room temperature.
• Centrifuge to separate serum from cells.
• Transfer the serum into a properly labeled secondary tube.
• Store serum samples at 2-8°C if not analyzing immediately or
freeze at -20°C or colder for long-term storage.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens that are hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric.
• Specimens collected in tubes with anticoagulants such as EDTA,
heparin, or citrate.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Laboratory Analyzer: Automated Immunoassay or LC-MS/MS
system suitable for measuring 17-Hydroxyprogesterone.
• Calibrators: Certified reference materials for 17-
Hydroxyprogesterone.
• Quality Control Materials: Commercially available QC materials
for low, medium, and high levels of 17-Hydroxyprogesterone.
• Assay-specific reagents: As specified by the manufacturer of the
chosen analytical system.
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE): Lab coat, gloves, safety
goggles.
1. PROCEDURE
1. Pre-analysis Preparation:
▪ Calibrate the laboratory instrument as per the
manufacturer’s instructions.
▪ Run quality control samples to ensure system
accuracy and precision before analyzing patient
samples.
▪ Review and ensure that all patient samples are
properly labeled and free from contaminants or
hemolysis that could impact the result.
2. Sample Analysis: a. Verify that the instrument settings
align with the protocols for 17-Hydroxyprogesterone
analysis. b. Load calibrators and quality control materials
onto the instrument. c. Begin the initial setup by
performing instrument calibration, ensuring inclusion
criteria for calibration and quality control are met. d. Load
patient serum samples onto the instrument. e. Follow
instrument protocol to perform the analysis of serum
samples for 17-Hydroxyprogesterone. f. Upon completion,
review the generated results, ensuring all quality control
criteria are met before validating patient results.
3. Post-analysis Verification:
▪ Evaluate the results from quality controls for any
outlier, potential drift, or deviation that needs corrective
actions.
▪ Ensure all patient results fall within validated range.
Apply a troubleshooting approach for analytes falling
outside the defined acceptable ranges.
▪ Print or electronically save the analysis results
meeting laboratory criteria.
2. REPORTING RESULTS
• Verified results are transmitted to the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
• Results must be reviewed and verified by the technologist before
being released to the requesting physician.
• Critical or significantly abnormal results must be promptly
reported following laboratory policy on critical value reporting.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Follow reference intervals provided from the latest clinical
guidelines and those recommended by the assay kit
manufacturers.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Quality control material should be run at defined intervals: at least
every run/batch or daily.
• Record all QC data to track method performance and instrument
stability.
• Investigate and take corrective actions for runs failing QC criteria
prior to releasing patient results.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to the assay kit insert for known limitations of the 17-
Hydroxyprogesterone method.
• Interpret results in the context of clinical and laboratory findings.
