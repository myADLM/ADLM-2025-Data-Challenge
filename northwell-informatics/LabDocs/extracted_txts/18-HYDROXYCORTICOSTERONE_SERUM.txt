Protocol for the Analytical Phase of Generating Results for 18-
Hydroxycorticosterone, Serum
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the analysis of 18-
Hydroxycorticosterone levels in serum samples.
2. SCOPE
This protocol applies to all laboratory personnel involved in the
processing and analysis of 18-Hydroxycorticosterone, Serum.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of trained laboratory personnel to follow this
protocol accurately to ensure reliable and reproducible results.
Supervisors are responsible for ensuring adherence to this protocol
and addressing any issues related to the analytical phase.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS and STABILITY
Specimen Type:
• Serum
Collection Requirements:
• Collect blood in a serum separator tube (SST).
• After collection, allow the blood to clot for at least 30 minutes but
no longer than 2 hours at room temperature.
Handling and Storage:
• Centrifuge the sample within 2 hours of collection at 3000 rpm for
10 minutes at 4°C.
• Immediately aliquot the serum into a labeled polypropylene tube.
• Store aliquots at -20°C or lower if immediate analysis is not
possible.
Stability:
• Serum samples are stable for up to 7 days when stored at -20°C.
For long-term storage, keep at -70°C.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES:
• High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) or Liquid
Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry/Mass Spectrometry (LC-
MS/MS) system.
• Analytical balance
• Centrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Pipettes
• Standard and control solutions for 18-Hydroxycorticosterone
• Mobile phase solvents (e.g., methanol, water, formic acid)
• Calibration standards for 18-Hydroxycorticosterone
• Quality control materials
6. QUALITY CONTROL:
Materials:
• Utilize commercially prepared quality control materials.
• Follow manufacturer recommendations for storage and handling.
Procedure:
• Run quality control samples at the beginning of each batch and
after every ten patient samples.
• Acceptable ranges for quality control results must be established
based on instrument and method validation data.
• Investigate and resolve any quality control results that fall outside
acceptable ranges before reporting patient results.
7. PROCEDURE:
1. Preparation of Standards and Controls:
◦ Prepare calibration standards ranging from the lower limit of
quantification (LLOQ) to the upper limit of quantification
(ULOQ) as per validation protocol.
◦ Use quality control materials at various concentration levels
to monitor the accuracy and precision of the analysis.
2. Sample Preparation:
◦ Thaw serum samples at room temperature.
◦ Vortex each sample for 10 seconds.
◦ Pipette a specific volume (e.g., 100 µL) of the serum sample
into a clean labeled test tube.
◦ Add an appropriate volume of internal standard if required.
◦ Vortex mix for 15 seconds.
3. Extraction:
◦ Perform the extraction using a liquid-liquid extraction
method or solid-phase extraction (SPE) as validated.
◦ Follow the steps outlined in the method validation document
for extraction.
4. Chromatography:
◦ Set up the HPLC or LC-MS/MS system as per the validated
method.
◦ Ensure the mobile phases are degassed and ready to use.
◦ Inject the sample extract into the system.
5. Data Acquisition:
◦ Acquire data according to the system's standard operating
procedures.
◦ Monitor the chromatograms and mass spectra to ensure
proper analyte identification and quantification.
6. Calibration and Calculation:
◦ Create a calibration curve by plotting the peak area ratios
(analyte/internal standard) against the standard
concentrations.
◦ Use the calibration curve to calculate the concentration of
18-Hydroxycorticosterone in patient samples.
8. REPORTING RESULTS:
• Verify that all quality control results fall within acceptable ranges
before reporting patient results.
• Results are reported in ng/mL or the appropriate unit per the
laboratory's reporting guidelines.
• Document any unusual findings, interferences, or deviations from
the protocol.
9. REFERENCE INTERVALS:
• Establish reference intervals based on the population studied or
as provided by the laboratory director.
• Report results outside normal ranges with the appropriate
comments or flags.
10. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
• Include limitations such as cross-reactivity with other steroids,
potential interferences, or any method-specific constraints as
outlined in the method validation document.
11. REFERENCES:
• Include references to standard method validation documents,
manufacturer’s instructions, and relevant scientific literature.
By following this protocol, laboratory personnel will ensure the
accurate and reproducible measurement of 18-Hydroxycorticosterone
in serum samples, thereby providing reliable data for clinical
decision-making.
