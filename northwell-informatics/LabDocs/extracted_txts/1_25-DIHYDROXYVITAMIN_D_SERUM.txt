Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D, Serum
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to outline the steps required for the
analysis and generation of results for 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D in
serum samples. This SOP ensures accurate and reliable results
following specific protocols and guidelines.
Responsibility:
• It is the responsibility of designated laboratory personnel to follow
the steps outlined in this procedure to ensure accuracy and
compliance with laboratory standards.
• All staff must be diligent in identifying any issues that may affect
test results and must report these to a supervisor immediately.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Preferred Specimen:
• 2.0 mL of serum, obtained from blood collected in a plain red-top
or serum separator tube (SST).
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Plasma samples are not acceptable.
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or grossly contaminated samples should be
rejected.
Storage:
• Specimens should be stored at 2-8°C and analyzed within 7 days
if kept refrigerated.
• If storage exceeds 7 days, specimens should be frozen at -20°C
for up to 6 months.
• Repeated freeze-thaw cycles should be avoided.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)
or similar analytical instrument.
• Calibration standards and quality control materials specific for
1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D.
• Mobile phase solvents and reagents (e.g., methanol, acetonitrile,
water, formic acid).
• Sample preparation materials: solid-phase extraction (SPE)
cartridges, centrifuge tubes, pipettes.
• Personal protective equipment (PPE).
1. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation:
1. Allow serum samples to reach room temperature if previously
refrigerated or frozen.
2. Vortex each sample briefly to ensure homogeneity.
3. Perform protein precipitation by adding an appropriate solvent
(e.g., methanol) in a specific ratio to the serum sample.
4. Centrifuge at 10,000 rpm for 10 minutes to pellet precipitated
proteins.
5. Carefully transfer the supernatant to a new centrifuge tube.
6. Perform solid-phase extraction (SPE) using cartridges to clean
and concentrate the 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D from the serum.
Follow manufacturer instructions for SPE protocol.
7. Elute the analyte with an appropriate solvent into vials suitable
for LC-MS/MS analysis.
B. Instrument Calibration:
1. Prepare calibration standards covering the expected range of
1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D concentrations.
2. Run calibration standards on the LC-MS/MS according to
instrument-specific protocols.
3. Establish a calibration curve by plotting the response of the
instrument against the known concentrations of the standards.
C. Quality Control:
1. Run quality control samples alongside patient samples at both
low and high concentration ranges to ensure the accuracy of
the analysis.
2. Verify that QC results fall within the acceptable range before
proceeding with patient sample analysis.
3. Document all QC results and any corrective actions taken if QC
results fall outside the acceptable range.
D. Sample Analysis:
1. Inject prepared serum sample aliquots into the LC-MS/MS
instrument.
2. Ensure proper sequence and inclusion of blank samples,
calibration standards, and quality controls within the sample
run.
3. Analyze the chromatograms and identify peaks corresponding
to 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D.
4. Quantify the concentration of 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D in serum
samples using the established calibration curve.
5. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results are automatically transmitted to the Laboratory
Information System (LIS) for review.
• Technologists must review and verify the results before final
reporting.
• Document any issues related to sample integrity or analysis, and
take appropriate corrective actions as needed.
• Report results according to site-specific guidelines, including
appropriate reference intervals and conditions for specific patient
populations.
