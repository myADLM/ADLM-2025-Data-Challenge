Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for 1,3-BETA-D-GLUCAN (FUNGITELL),
Serum
1. PURPOSE
To establish a standardized procedure for the analytical phase of
testing for 1,3-BETA-D-GLUCAN (FUNGITELL) in serum to ensure
accurate and reliable test results.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel performing the 1,3-
BETA-D-GLUCAN (FUNGITELL) assay in a CLIA-certified laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Laboratory Technologists are responsible for performing the test
as per the procedure and ensuring the accuracy and precision of
test results.
• Supervisors are responsible for the oversight and quality control
of the testing process.
4. DEFINITIONS
1,3-BETA-D-GLUCAN: A polysaccharide found in the cell walls of
fungi. Detection in serum helps in diagnosing invasive fungal
infections.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• FUNGITELL Assay Kit
• Microplate reader capable of measuring 405 nm
• Pipettes (single and multi-channel)
• Pipette tips (sterile and RNase/DNase-free)
• Sterile, endotoxin-free microtubes
• Sterile, endotoxin-free microplates
• Timer
• Calibrated water bath or incubator
• Calibrated refrigerator and freezer
• Calibration materials and controls as provided in the kit
6. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred specimen: Serum collected in a red-top tube or serum
separator tube (SST).
• Specimen stability: Serum should be separated from cells within 2
hours of collection and stored at 2-8°C for up to 5 days or frozen
at -20°C or lower for longer storage.
• Unacceptable specimens: Hemolyzed, lipemic, or contaminated
specimens.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Ensure proper functioning of all equipment before starting the
assay.
• Use control materials provided in the FUNGITELL kit. Control
results must be within the specified ranges.
• Run at least one positive and one negative control with each
batch of samples.
8. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation
1. Allow all reagents and controls to reach room temperature
before use.
2. Thaw any frozen specimens thoroughly and mix gently.
B. Reagent Preparation
1. Prepare the working solutions as per the manufacturer's
instructions included in the FUNGITELL Assay Kit.
2. Label all reagents and working solutions appropriately with the
preparation date.
C. Sample and Control Preparation
1. Pipette 50 µL of standards, controls, and patient serum into
designated wells of the microplate.
2. Ensure the use of appropriate pipetting techniques to avoid
cross-contamination.
D. Incubation
1. Add 50 µL of reconstituted reagent into each well containing
samples and controls.
2. Cover the plate with a plate sealer or lid and incubate at 37°C
for 30 minutes.
3. After incubation, add the stop solution as per the
manufacturer's instructions.
E. Reading the Results
1. Measure the absorbance at 405 nm using a microplate reader.
2. Compare the absorbance values to the standard curve to
determine the concentration of 1,3-BETA-D-GLUCAN in patient
samples.
9. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
• Results are interpreted based on the manufacturer’s guidelines
and cut-off values provided in the FUNGITELL Assay Kit.
• Report findings as positive or negative for suspected fungal
infection.
10. REPORTING RESULTS
• Enter the patient results into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
• All results must be reviewed and verified by the technologist
before being reported.
• Retain a printout or electronic copy of the results and quality
controls for record-keeping.
11. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If control results fall outside of the acceptable range, do not report
patient results. Investigate the cause, repeat the control tests, and
document corrective actions.
• Any significant discrepancy between expected and observed
results warrants a repeat of the assay.
