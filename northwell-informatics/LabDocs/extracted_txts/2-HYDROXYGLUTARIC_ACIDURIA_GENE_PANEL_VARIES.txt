Hydroxyglutaric Aciduria Gene Panel, ensuring high-quality, accurate,
and timely results.
2. SCOPE:
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel involved in the
processing, analysis, and reporting of the 2-Hydroxyglutaric Aciduria
Gene Panel.
3. RESPONSIBILITY:
• Laboratory Technologists: Perform testing and initial
interpretation.
• Supervisors: Review and validate results before reporting.
• Laboratory Directors: Ensure compliance with CLIA regulations
and overall quality control.
4. DEFINITIONS:
• Gene Panel: A targeted group of genes tested to identify
mutations associated with 2-Hydroxyglutaric Aciduria.
• PCR: Polymerase Chain Reaction, a method to amplify DNA.
• NGS: Next-Generation Sequencing, a method for sequencing
DNA.
5. PROCEDURE:
A) Equipment and Reagents:
• PCR Machine
• NGS Sequencer
• Pipettes and tips
• Centrifuge
• Quality Control Materials
• DNA Extraction Kits
• Target-specific Primers
• Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS)
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
B) Sample Preparation:
1. DNA Extraction:
◦ Extract DNA from the specimen using a commercial DNA
extraction kit according to the manufacturer's instructions.
◦ Quantify the DNA using a spectrophotometer and record
concentration.
◦ If the DNA concentration is below the threshold, consider re-
extraction.
2. PCR Amplification:
◦ Prepare PCR master mix with target-specific primers.
◦ Add extracted DNA to the PCR master mix.
◦ Amplify DNA following PCR cycling parameters optimized
for the target genes.
◦ Verify PCR product using gel electrophoresis.
C) Next-Generation Sequencing:
1. Library Preparation:
◦ Prepare sequencing libraries from the amplified DNA using
a commercial library preparation kit.
◦ Quantify and qualify the libraries using a fluorometer.
◦ Pool libraries as required for sequencing run.
2. Sequencing:
◦ Load pooled libraries onto the NGS sequencer.
◦ Perform sequencing run according to the sequencer's
protocol.
◦ Ensure necessary controls are included in the sequencing
run.
D) Bioinformatics Analysis:
1. Data Processing:
◦ Transfer sequencing data to the bioinformatics pipeline.
◦ Perform quality checks on the raw data.
◦ Align sequences to the reference genome using specialized
software.
2. Variant Calling:
◦ Identify variants in the targeted genes.
◦ Annotate variants based on known databases (e.g., ClinVar,
dbSNP).
3. Interpretation:
◦ Review variants for pathogenicity.
◦ Cross-reference with patient’s clinical information.
E) Quality Control:
• Perform routine checks on equipment and reagents.
• Run internal controls at the start of the PCR and sequencing
reaction.
• Document all quality control results.
• Ensure corrective action is taken for any deviations from expected
values.
F) Reporting Results:
1. Result Validation:
◦ Supervisors review and validate the variant interpretations.
◦ Confirm that all quality control criteria are met.
◦ Ensure consistency with clinical data provided.
2. Result Communication:
◦ Generate report including identified variants, their clinical
significance, and recommended follow-up.
◦ Transmit report through LIMS to the requesting clinician.
◦ Ensure compliance with all HIPAA regulations.
