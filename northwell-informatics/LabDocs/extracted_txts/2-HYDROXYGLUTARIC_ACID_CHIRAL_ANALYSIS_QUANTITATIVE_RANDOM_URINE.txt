Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
2-HYDROXYGLUTARIC ACID CHIRAL ANALYSIS,
QUANTITATIVE, RANDOM, URINE
1. PURPOSE To provide standardized procedures for the accurate
and precise quantification of 2-hydroxyglutaric acid (2-HG)
enantiomers (D-2-HG and L-2-HG) in random urine samples using
chromatographic techniques.
2. SCOPE This SOP describes the procedure for the quantitative
analysis of D- and L-2-hydroxyglutaric acid in urine specimens within
a CLIA-certified laboratory. This includes specimen preparation,
analytical methodology, and result reporting.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Laboratory technologists are responsible for performing the
analysis, following the protocol, maintaining equipment, and
adhering to quality control processes.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring that the technologists
are trained and competent, reviewing results, and overseeing the
laboratory operations related to this test.
4. SPECIMEN HANDLING
4.1 Preferred/Acceptable Specimen:
• 10 mL of random urine collected in a sterile, leak-proof container.
4.2 Unacceptable Specimen:
• Specimens not properly labeled with patient information.
• Specimens collected in non-sterile containers.
• Specimens with an insufficient volume for analysis.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
5.1 Equipment:
• High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system or Gas
Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS)
• Centrifuge
• pH meter
• Vortex mixer
• Water bath or dry heating block
5.2 Reagents:
• Mobile phase solvents (e.g., water, acetonitrile, formic acid)
• Derivatization reagents for chiral analysis
• Internal standard compounds
• Calibration standards of D-2-HG and L-2-HG
• Quality control materials
5.3 Supplies:
• Urine collection containers
• Sample vials and caps
• Syringes
• Filters for sample preparation (e.g., 0.22 µm)
• Pipettes and pipette tips
6. PROCEDURE
6.1 Sample Preparation:
1. Allow urine specimens to reach room temperature if
refrigerated.
2. Vortex the urine sample thoroughly to ensure homogeneity.
3. Measure the pH of the urine sample and adjust it if necessary
to the optimal range for the derivatization reaction (refer to
reagent specifications).
4. Transfer a specific volume of urine (e.g., 1 mL) to a labeled
sample vial.
5. Add the internal standard to each sample vial and vortex to mix.
6. Proceed with the derivatization process as outlined in the
reagent protocol:
◦ Add derivatization reagent to each sample.
◦ Incubate the samples in a water bath or dry heating block at
the specified temperature and time.
7. Filter the derivatized sample using a 0.22 µm filter to remove
any particulates.
6.2 Chromatographic Analysis:
1. Set up the HPLC or GC-MS system according to
manufacturer’s instructions and method-specific parameters.
2. Equilibrate the system with the mobile phase until a stable
baseline is achieved.
3. Inject a calibration standard mixture to verify system
performance and calibrate the instrument.
4. Inject the derivatized urine samples into the chromatographic
system.
5. Collect and analyze chromatographic data to quantify the
enantiomers of 2-hydroxyglutaric acid.
6.3 Quality Control:
1. Run quality control samples at the beginning and end of each
batch of samples.
2. Verify that quality control results fall within the established
acceptable limits before proceeding with patient sample
analyses.
3. Document any deviations and take corrective actions as
necessary.
7. REPORTING RESULTS:
1. Quantitative results for D-2-HG and L-2-HG should be reported
in µmol/L.
2. Verify the results according to laboratory protocols.
3. Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS) for
review by a supervisor.
4. Review and verify all results and quality control data before
generating final reports.
5. Include reference ranges and interpretive comments as
appropriate.
8. REFERENCE INTERVALS: Each laboratory should establish its
own reference intervals based on the population it serves and the
specific methodology used.
9. PROCEDURAL NOTES:
1. Refer to manufacturer’s instructions and reagent protocols for
detailed derivatization steps and chromatographic conditions.
2. Ensure all equipment is regularly calibrated and maintained.
3. Follow biohazard protocols to ensure safe handling of urine
specimens.

chromatographic equipment and reagents.
• Relevant clinical laboratory science literature on the quantification
of hydroxyglutaric acid.
APPROVAL AND REVIEW:
• This SOP must be reviewed and approved by the laboratory
supervisor.
• Review and update annually or as needed based on changes in
methodology or regulations.
