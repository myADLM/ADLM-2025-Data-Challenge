Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase for Generating Results for 21-Deoxycortisol,
Serum
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for the measurement and reporting of 21-
Deoxycortisol levels in serum specimens using validated laboratory
methods. This SOP ensures accuracy, precision, and reliability of the
results.
2. SCOPE
This protocol applies to all trained personnel engaged in the
analytical phase of generating 21-Deoxycortisol results in the
laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
Trained and designated laboratory personnel are responsible for
performing the analytical procedures as outlined in this SOP. It is the
responsibility of all staff to identify any issues in the procedure and to
notify the supervisor immediately.
4. SPECIMEN
• Preferred/acceptable:
◦ Fresh serum collected in a red-top or serum separator tube
(SST). Specimen should be properly labeled with patient
identification, collection date/time.
• Unacceptable:
◦ Specimens collected in tubes containing anticoagulants such
as EDTA, sodium fluoride, or heparin.
◦ Specimens with hemolysis, lipemia, or icterus above
acceptable limits.
◦ Specimens stored for longer periods than indicated by stability
guidelines (refer to section 6).
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• HPLC (High-Performance Liquid Chromatography) or LC-MS/MS
(Liquid Chromatography coupled with Tandem Mass
Spectrometry)
• Calibrators for 21-Deoxycortisol
• Internal standards
• Quality control materials (two levels)
• Pipettes and tips
• Centrifuge
• Sample vials
• Disposables (gloves, tubes)
6. STABILITY
• Serum is stable for 24 hours at room temperature.
• Serum is stable for up to 7 days at 2-8°C.
• Serum is stable for up to 3 months at -20°C or colder.
• Mix thoroughly before analysis if stored frozen and thawed.
7. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Centrifuge serum tubes at 2000-2500 RPM for 10 minutes at
room temperature.
2. Carefully transfer supernatant to sample vials avoiding
contamination from cells or fibrin.
Analysis:
1. Set up the HPLC or LC-MS/MS system according to
manufacturer’s instructions. Perform calibration using provided
calibrators.
2. Prepare and introduce internal standards to each specimen and
quality control sample.
3. Inject serum samples and calibrators into the system.
4. Run the instrument and monitor parameters ensuring all
controls are within tolerance limits.
Monitoring Instrument Performance:
1. Verify retention times, peak shapes, and area counts to ensure
no issues in chromatography.
2. Check instrument calibration and make necessary adjustments.
Troubleshooting: If any anomalies are observed (e.g., unexpected
peaks, absence of expected peaks), repeat the injection. If issues
persist, consult troubleshooting guidelines or contact the supervisor.
Quality Control:
1. Analyze two levels of QC material at the start of every batch.
2. Verify that QC results are within acceptable limits before
proceeding with sample analysis.
3. Document all QC activities in the Quality Control log with date,
time, and initials.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Ensure all results are reviewed for accuracy by comparing
controls and specimen data.
2. Sign-off by trained laboratory technologist.
3. Transmit results to Laboratory Information System (LIS).
4. Report critical values according to the laboratory's critical
values policy.
Reference Intervals:
Reference intervals for 21-Deoxycortisol will be specified based on
established clinical guidelines and could vary by age and sex.
9. QUALITY CONTROL AND METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to instrument-specific guidelines for detailed limitations.
• Document all quality control results and corrective actions taken.
• Review method limitations provided in the product insert for
calibrators and QC material.
10. REFERENCES
Include instrument manuals, product inserts, and relevant clinical
guidelines.
Review and Validation:
This protocol must be reviewed annually or as required by changes in
technology or clinical guidelines.
