Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for 21-HYDROXYLASE
ANTIBODIES, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedural guide is to ensure accurate and
reliable testing of 21-hydroxylase antibodies in serum specimens.
This procedure aims to deliver consistent test results for the
diagnosis of autoimmune adrenalitis and Addison's disease.
2. SCOPE
This SOP covers the analytical phase of testing for 21-hydroxylase
antibodies in serum specimens. It includes criteria for specimen
acceptance, reagents preparation, equipment calibration, testing
procedure, and reporting results.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of trained laboratory personnel to conduct the
analytical procedures as per this protocol. Supervisors are
responsible for monitoring and ensuring adherence to this SOP,
addressing any deviations, and implementing corrective actions.
4. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
• Automated Immunoassay Analyzer (e.g., ELISA,
chemiluminescence)
• Control sera: positive and negative controls
• 96-well microtiter plates (if using ELISA)
• Pipettes and tips
• Incubator set at 37°C
• Plate washer (if using ELISA)
• Microplate reader
• Specimen tubes
5. REAGENTS
• 21-Hydroxylase Antibodies Test Kit (specific to the analyzer being
used)
• Wash buffer, substrate solutions, and stopping solutions as
recommended by the test kit manufacturer
• Calibration materials provided by the test kit manufacturer
• Deionized water
6. SPECIMEN
Acceptable Specimen:
• Freshly collected serum samples
• 2-3 mL of blood collected in serum separator tubes (SST) or red-
top tubes
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples
• Clotted or mislabeled samples
• Samples not stored properly or beyond stability limits defined by
the assay manufacturer
7. PROCEDURE:
A. Pre-Analytical Preparation:
1. Specimen Handling:
◦ Allow the blood specimen to clot at room temperature for 30
minutes.
◦ Centrifuge the specimen at 1500 x g for 10 minutes to
separate the serum.
◦ Transfer the serum to a clearly labeled secondary tube if
necessary and process immediately or store at 2-8°C for up
to 7 days or -20°C for longer storage.
2. Daily Equipment Check:
◦ Ensure that the Immunoassay Analyzer is properly
calibrated and maintained.
◦ Perform daily maintenance checks as per manufacturer's
instructions.
3. Reagents Preparation:
◦ Prepare reagents and controls as per the manufacturer’s
instructions.
◦ Reconstitute calibration and control materials and allow
them to reach room temperature before use.
B. Analytical Phase:
1. Loading the Sample:
◦ Thaw frozen serum specimens to room temperature and mix
gently.
◦ Load standards, controls, and patient samples into their
designated wells or analyzer input as per the test kit
protocol.
2. Running the Test:
◦ Follow the specific test protocol provided by the 21-
Hydroxylase Antibodies Test Kit.
◦ Incubate samples with antigen-coated wells (if using ELISA)
or as per analyzer’s sequence.
◦ Wash away unbound substances according to protocol.
◦ Add enzyme-conjugate reagent followed by substrate
solution.
◦ After the final incubation, stop the reaction using the
stopping solution.
3. Data Acquisition:
◦ For ELISA: Read the absorbance using a microplate reader
at the recommended wavelength.
◦ For chemiluminescence: Acquire readings directly from the
analyzer’s software.
◦ Ensure the results from controls fall within the acceptable
range before analyzing patient samples.
C. Post-Analytical Phase:
1. Reviewing Results:
◦ Results should be evaluated against the calibration curve.
◦ Any outliers or values outside the expected range must be
noted and re-evaluated.
2. Releasing Reports:
◦ Document results in the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
◦ Verify and release results according to laboratory protocols.
3. Quality Control:
◦ Run internal quality controls with each batch of samples
tested.
◦ Document and address any deviations noted in the control
results following QC policies.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Reference Intervals: Negative for the presence of 21-hydroxylase
antibodies in normal patients.
• Results should be reported in a format consistent with laboratory’s
reporting guidelines.
• If an interference or anomaly is detected, report the results with
an appropriate comment indicating "Unable to provide result due
to sample interference."
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to the specific 21-Hydroxylase Antibodies Test Kit insert for
limitations related to reagent stability, handling, and technical
constraints.
