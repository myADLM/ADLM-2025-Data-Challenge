SOP Title: Analytical Procedure for 21-Hydroxylase Gene
(CYP21A2) Full Gene Analysis
1. PURPOSE
To lay out the specific steps involved in performing the full gene
analysis of the 21-Hydroxylase Gene (CYP21A2), which includes
amplification, sequencing, and interpretation of results in the
laboratory.
RESPONSIBILITY:
It is the responsibility of the laboratory staff trained in molecular
genetics techniques to perform and document the procedures
described. Supervisors must ensure that the procedures are followed
correctly and that corrective actions are taken if deviations occur.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
Preferred/Acceptable Specimens:
• EDTA whole blood (3-5 mL).
• Extracted DNA (minimum 100 ng of DNA with A260/280 ratio
between 1.8 and 2.0).
• Specimens must be labelled correctly with at least two patient
identifiers and received with a completed requisition form.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens without proper labeling or identification.
• Specimens with an insufficient volume of blood or low DNA
concentration/quality.
• Specimens that are hemolyzed, coagulated, or degraded.
3. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
Equipment:
• Thermocycler (PCR machine)
• Microcentrifuge
• Pipettes and sterile filtered tips
• DNA sequencing equipment (e.g., Sanger Sequencer)
• Electrophoresis apparatus
Reagents:
• PCR Master Mix
• Specific primers for CYP21A2 gene
• Agarose gel and buffer
• DNA Ladder
• Sequencing reagents and consumable materials
4. PROCEDURE
Step 1: DNA Extraction
• Extract DNA from whole blood using a validated method (e.g.,
Qiagen DNA extraction kit).
• Measure DNA concentration and purity using a
spectrophotometer.
• Store DNA at -20°C until further use.
Step 2: PCR Amplification
• Prepare PCR Master Mix, including specific primers for full-length
amplification of the CYP21A2 gene.
• Distribute Master Mix into PCR tubes and add the DNA template.
• Perform PCR under the following conditions (adjust as required):
◦ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 5 mins
◦ 35 cycles of:
▪ Denaturation: 95°C for 30 secs
▪ Annealing: 58-62°C (based on the primer) for 30 secs
▪ Extension: 72°C for 1 min/kb
◦ Final extension: 72°C for 10 mins
• Verify PCR products on a 1.5% agarose gel.
Step 3: Purification of PCR Products
• Use a commercial PCR purification kit (e.g., Qiagen PCR
Purification Kit) to clean up the PCR products.
• Measure the concentration of purified PCR products.
• Store purified products at -20°C until sequencing.
Step 4: DNA Sequencing
• Set up sequencing reactions using the purified PCR products with
specific sequencing primers.
• Follow the sequencing protocol of the sequencer in use (e.g.,
BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit for Sanger
sequencing).
• Analyze the sequencing products using capillary electrophoresis.
Step 5: Data Analysis
• Download and analyze sequencing data using appropriate
bioinformatics tools and software (e.g., SeqScape or similar).
• Compare sequences to reference CYP21A2 gene using BLAST or
appropriate sequence alignment tools.
• Identify mutations, polymorphisms, or other variants.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include positive and negative controls with each run.
• Repeat the test if controls do not perform as expected.
• Perform regular maintenance and verification of equipment.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
• Document and interpret findings as per laboratory policy.
• Results must be reviewed and verified by qualified personnel.
• Relevant mutations and their potential clinical implications should
be included in the report.
• Notify the requesting clinician of any critical or significant findings.
7. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Report whether variants are known to be pathogenic, likely
pathogenic, benign, or of uncertain significance based on current
literature and databases such as ClinVar, HGMD.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• The primers used must cover the entire gene, including all exons
and clinically significant intronic regions.
• Rare variants or complex rearrangements may not be detected by
standard sequencing methods.
• Any identified complex or novel variant should be confirmed with
an alternative method or through consultation with clinical
genetics.
9. REFERENCES
• Reference protocols and validation documents.
• Relevant literature and database references for variant
classification.
• Manufacturer's manuals for all equipment and reagent kits used.
This SOP ensures the reliable analysis of the 21-Hydroxylase
(CYP21A2) gene, with accurate detection and interpretation of
genetic variants.
