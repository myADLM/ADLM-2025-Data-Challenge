Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for 22q11.2 Deletion/Duplication Using
Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH)
1. PURPOSE
This procedure outlines the standardized process for performing
Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) to detect 22q11.2 deletion/
duplication on patient specimens. The aim is to ensure consistent
and accurate results that can aid in the diagnosis and clinical
management of conditions associated with this genetic abnormality.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing the
FISH analysis, recording the results, and ensuring the quality and
integrity of the data. It is the responsibility of all laboratory staff to
perform the procedures as described and to report any irregularities
to the designated supervisor.
3. EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS
• Fluorescence Microscope
• Hybridization Chamber
• Incubator
• Humidified Chamber
• Water Bath
• Vysis LSI 22q11.2 Probe Kit (or other appropriate probe kits)
• Ethanol series (70%, 85%, 100%)
• SSC Buffer (2x SSC, 0.3% NP-40)
• DAPI counterstain
• Gloves, lab coat, and other personal protective equipment (PPE)
4. SPECIMEN
• Accepted Specimens: Peripheral blood or bone marrow aspirates,
cultured amniocytes, or chorionic villus sampling (CVS)
specimens.
• Handling: Specimens should be processed immediately upon
receipt and stored at the appropriate temperature until analysis.
5. PROCEDURE
A. SLIDE PREPARATION
1. Cell Harvesting and Fixation:
◦ Harvest cells according to standard cytogenetics protocols.
◦ Fix cells using 3:1 methanol:glacial acetic acid solution.
◦ Drop cells onto clean slides to create metaphase spreads
that are optimal for FISH.
2. Pretreatment:
◦ Immerse slides in 2x SSC at 37°C for 10 minutes.
◦ Dehydrate slides in an ethanol series (70%, 85%, and
100%) for 2 minutes each.
B. PROBE APPLICATION AND HYBRIDIZATION
1. Preparation of Hybridization Mix:
◦ Add the appropriate FISH probe to the hybridization buffer
as per manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Denature probe at 75°C for 5 minutes and keep on ice.
2. Denaturation of Target DNA:
◦ Add 10 µL of the probe mixture to each slide.
◦ Cover with a coverslip and seal using rubber cement.
◦ Denature slides at 72°C for 2-5 minutes using a
hybridization chamber.
◦ Transfer to 37°C incubator and hybridize for 14-16 hours.
C. POST-HYBRIDIZATION WASHING
1. Washing:
◦ Remove coverslips carefully.
◦ Wash slides in 2x SSC/0.3% NP-40 at 72°C for 2 minutes.
◦ Drain slides and wash in room-temperature 2x SSC/0.3%
NP-40 for 1 minute.
2. Dehydration:
◦ Dehydrate in an ethanol series (70%, 85%, 100%) for 2
minutes each.
◦ Air-dry slides completely.
D. COUNTERSTAINING AND VISUALIZATION
1. DAPI Staining:
◦ Apply 10 µL DAPI counterstain to each slide and cover with
a coverslip.
2. Fluorescence Microscopy:
◦ Examine slides under a fluorescence microscope using
appropriate filter settings for the specific fluorophores.
◦ Capture images for documentation and analysis.
6. INTERPRETATION AND REPORTING OF RESULTS
• Analyze the hybridization signals in a minimum of 20 metaphase
cells per specimen.
• Ensure quality checks for signal intensity, localization, and
specificity.
• Identify and classify the presence or absence of 22q11.2 deletion/
duplication.
• Record findings in the laboratory information system (LIS),
detailing signal patterns and any observations.
• Prepare a comprehensive report including results, interpretation,
and recommendations in accordance with clinical guidelines.
• Verify and sign the report before releasing it to the clinician.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run positive and negative control slides with each batch to
ensure assay performance.
• Perform proficiency testing periodically as outlined by CLIA and
other regulatory requirements.
• Document any deviations from the procedure and immediate
corrective actions taken.
8. SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS
• Adhere to standard laboratory safety protocols.
• Dispose of all biohazard material and chemical reagents following
established waste management procedures.
