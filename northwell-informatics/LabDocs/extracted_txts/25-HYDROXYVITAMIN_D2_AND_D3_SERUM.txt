1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedures for the accurate measurement, analysis,
and reporting of 25-Hydroxyvitamin D2 and D3 levels in serum
samples to ensure the reliability and consistency of test results.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel involved in the testing
process for 25-Hydroxyvitamin D2 and D3 in serum samples.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the laboratory personnel to ensure that all
procedures are followed accurately and consistently. Any deviations
must be documented and reported to the supervisor.
4. DEFINITIONS
• 25-Hydroxyvitamin D2 (ergocalciferol) and 25-Hydroxyvitamin
D3 (cholecalciferol): Forms of Vitamin D measured to assess
Vitamin D status.
• Serum: The clear, yellowish fluid that remains after blood has
clotted, used for various diagnostic tests.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• LC-MS/MS system
• Centrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Ultra-freezer (-80°C)
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Vials (screw cap, amber)
• 25-Hydroxyvitamin D2 and D3 calibration standards and controls
• Internal standard (e.g., 25-Hydroxyvitamin D3-d3)
• Solvents (e.g., methanol, water, acetonitrile) HPLC-grade
• 0.1% formic acid in water
• 96-well plates
• Liquid handler (automated or manual)
6. PROCEDURE
A) SAMPLE PREPARATION
i) Thaw serum samples completely and mix thoroughly by vortexing
for 30 seconds. ii) Centrifuge the samples at 3,000 rpm for 10
minutes at 4°C. iii) Transfer 200 µL of the serum sample into a
labeled 96-well plate or individual vials.
B) STANDARD AND CONTROL PREPARATION
i) Prepare calibration standards by serial dilution of 25-
Hydroxyvitamin D2 and D3 stock solutions in serum to achieve
desired concentrations. ii) Prepare quality control (QC) samples at
low, medium, and high levels within the calibration range. iii) Aliquot
standards and controls into similar vessels/micro-well plates as used
for samples.
C) EXTRACTION
i) Add 20 µL of internal standard to each sample, standard, and
control. ii) Add 400 µL of acetonitrile to each tube/well for protein
precipitation. iii) Cap the tubes and vortex-mix vigorously for 2
minutes. iv) Centrifuge at 10,000 rpm for 10 minutes at 4°C. v)
Transfer clear supernatant to a new set of tubes or 96-well plate.
D) SOLID-PHASE EXTRACTION (SPE) (optional if required for
method adjustment)
i) Condition SPE cartridges with methanol and equilibrate with water.
ii) Load supernatant onto SPE cartridges. iii) Wash cartridges with
water followed by 5% methanol. iv) Elute with acetonitrile, collect the
effluent.
E) LC-MS/MS ANALYSIS
i) Transfer an appropriate volume (e.g., 20 µL) of the eluted extract
into an LC-MS/MS vial. ii) Set up the LC-MS/MS instrument
according to manufacturer instructions. iii) Program the LC-MS/MS
sequence to include sample, standard, and control runs. iv) Inject
samples into the LC-MS/MS system. v) Employ an LC gradient
optimized for Vitamin D metabolites, such as a C18 column with a
gradient of water (0.1% formic acid) and acetonitrile (0.1% formic
acid).
F) DATA ACQUISITION AND PROCESSING
i) Acquire mass spectrometric data using selected ion monitoring
(SIM) or multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) for 25-Hydroxyvitamin
D2, 25-Hydroxyvitamin D3, and the internal standard. ii) Integrate
peaks and calculate concentrations using the calibration curve. iii)
Ensure that the retention times match those of the standards and
internal standards.
G) QUALITY CONTROL AND TROUBLESHOOTING
i) Ensure that QC samples and internal standards are run with each
batch of samples to monitor method performance. ii) Investigate any
QC outliers or deviations and take corrective actions such as system
recalibration or repeat analysis. iii) Perform regular maintenance and
calibration of LC-MS/MS instrumentation as per manufacturer
guidelines.
H) REPORTING RESULTS
i) Review and verify results within the Laboratory Information System
(LIS). ii) Ensure that results include both 25-Hydroxyvitamin D2 and
D3 concentrations alongside reference intervals. iii) Report verified
results to ordering physicians or through the electronic health record
(EHR) system.
7. REFERENCES
i) Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines. ii)
Manufacturer's user manuals for LC-MS/MS systems. iii) Relevant
scientific literature on Vitamin D analysis methodologies.
8. DOCUMENTATION
i) All steps must be logged with date, time, and initials of the
performing technologist. ii) Deviations and corrective actions must be
documented promptly.
