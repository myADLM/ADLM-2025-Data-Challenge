Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Generation of Results for 25-
Hydroxyvitamin D:24,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D Ratio, Serum
1. PURPOSE
To provide accurate and precise determination of the 25-
Hydroxyvitamin D:24,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D ratio in serum
specimens as a measure of Vitamin D metabolism and related
biochemical status.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of the designated technologist to perform the
analytical procedures accurately, ensure the integrity and reliability of
results, and document findings in adherence with laboratory
protocols.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/acceptable:
• Serum collected in SST (Serum Separator Tube) or Red Top
Tube.
• Specimen must be centrifuged and separated from cells within 2
hours of collection.
Unacceptable:
• Specimens collected in anticoagulant tubes other than SST.
• Specimens that are hemolyzed to an extent that would interfere
with the assay.
• Specimens with significant lipemia that cannot be cleared by
ultracentrifugation.
• Samples received in the laboratory more than 72 hours post-
collection without proper storage conditions.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)
system.
• Calibration standards for 25-Hydroxyvitamin D and 24,25-
Dihydroxyvitamin D.
• Quality control material with known concentrations of analytes.
• Solvents and reagents for sample preparation, extraction, and
chromatography.
1. PROCEDURE A. Sample Preparation:
2. Thaw frozen serum samples at room temperature.
3. Vortex sample for 15 seconds to ensure homogeneity.
4. Pipette aliquots into labeled tubes for extraction.
5. Add internal standard to each sample and mix thoroughly.
6. Perform protein precipitation followed by centrifugation.
7. Transfer the supernatant for further clean-up steps, including
solid phase extraction (SPE).
B. Calibration and Instrument Preparation:
1. Calibrate the LC-MS/MS following manufacturer instructions.
2. Run blank and calibration standards to ensure instrument
performance.
3. Set up chromatography conditions and mass spectrometer
parameters for optimal detection.
C. Analysis:
1. Inject prepared sample aliquots into the LC-MS/MS.
2. Ensure proper chromatographic separation of analytes.
3. Acquire and process data using the software associated with
the LC-MS/MS system.
4. Quantitate concentrations of 25-Hydroxyvitamin D and 24,25-
Dihydroxyvitamin D.
D. Calculations and Reporting:
1. Calculate the 25-Hydroxyvitamin D:24,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D
ratio.
2. Review all analyte quantitation for QC acceptance criteria.
3. Record results and confirm the ratio as per reference
standards.
4. Report results in the laboratory information system (LIS),
including required documentation and annotations.
E. Quality Control:
1. Run QC samples at the beginning, midpoint, and end of the
batch.
2. Verify QC results meet predefined acceptance criteria.
3. Document any deviations and corrective actions.
4. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Ensure no sample contamination throughout the process.
• Awareness of matrix effects and potential interferences.
• Ensure proper instrument maintenance to avoid calibration drift.
1. SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS
• Follow laboratory safety protocols for handling biological
specimens and reagents.
• Use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE).

• Manufacturer instructions for LC-MS/MS system.
• Peer-reviewed articles relevant to Vitamin D metabolism analysis.
• Laboratory-specific guidelines for calibration and validation
protocols.
By following this SOP, laboratory personnel can ensure the accurate
and reliable determination of 25-Hydroxyvitamin D:24,25-
Dihydroxyvitamin D ratio in serum specimens, contributing to
effective patient diagnosis and management.
