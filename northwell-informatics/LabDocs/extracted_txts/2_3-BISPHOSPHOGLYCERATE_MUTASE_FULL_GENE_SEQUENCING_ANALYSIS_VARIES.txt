6. PROCEDURE
Step 1: Sample Preparation
1.1 Blood Samples:
• Collect 2-5 mL of peripheral blood in EDTA tubes.
1.2 Tissue Samples:
• Ensure tissue is fresh or properly frozen, not exceeding 100 mg.
1.3 Cell Cultures:
• Confirm ≥10^6 viable cells.
Step 2: DNA Extraction
2.1 Using the DNA Extraction Kit:
• Follow the manufacturer's protocol for the extraction of DNA from
the specified sample type.
• Quantify and check purity of the extracted DNA using a Nanodrop
spectrophotometer. Acceptable A260/A280 ratio is between 1.8 –
2.0.
Step 3: PCR Amplification of BPGM Gene
3.1 Primer Design:
• Use primer sets that flank the exons and exon-intron boundaries
of the BPGM gene.
3.2 PCR Reaction Setup:
• Prepare the PCR mix as follows:
◦ DNA template: 50 ng
◦ Forward primer: 10 pmol
◦ Reverse primer: 10 pmol
◦ Taq polymerase: as per manufacturer instructions
◦ dNTPs: 200 µM each
◦ Buffer: supplied with Taq enzyme
◦ Nuclease-free water: to 50 µL total volume
3.3 PCR Cycling Conditions:
• Initial denaturation: 95°C for 3 minutes
• 35 cycles of:
◦ Denaturation: 95°C for 30 seconds
◦ Annealing: [primer-specific temperature] for 30 seconds
◦ Extension: 72°C for 1 minute
• Final extension: 72°C for 10 minutes
Step 4: Gel Electrophoresis
4.1 Prepare Agarose Gel:
• Prepare a 1.5% agarose gel with DNA-safe dye.
4.2 Load PCR Product:
• Mix 5 µL of PCR product with 1 µL loading buffer and load into the
gel.
4.3 Run Gel Electrophoresis:
• Run the gel at 100V for 45 minutes. Visualize the bands using a
UV transilluminator.
Step 5: Sequencing
5.1 PCR Product Purification:
• Purify the PCR products using an appropriate purification method
(e.g., ExoSAP-IT).
5.2 Library Preparation:
• Prepare the sequencing library using the Illumina MiSeq Reagent
Kit following the manufacturer's instructions.
5.3 Sequencing Reaction:
• Load the prepared library into the DNA sequencer and start the
sequencing run.
Step 6: Data Analysis
6.1 Sequence Alignment:
• Align the raw sequence data to the reference BPGM gene
sequence using bioinformatics software.
6.2 Variant Calling:
• Identify variants using variant calling software and annotate using
an appropriate database (e.g., ClinVar, dbSNP).
6.3 Data Interpretation:
• Interpret variants in the context of known functional
consequences and clinical significance.
Step 7: Reporting Results
7.1 Report Preparation:
• Compile a report including patient information, sequencing
methodology, findings, interpretation, and recommendations.
7.2 Review and Verification:
• Review the report for accuracy and completeness. Obtain
verification from a senior scientist or supervisor.
7.3 Results Transmission:
• Send the finalized report to the ordering physician or healthcare
provider. Ensure all documentation complies with regulatory
standards.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform positive and negative controls with each sequencing run
to ensure the accuracy and validity of results.
• Ensure reagents and equipment are within their usage life and
maintain calibration of instruments regularly.
