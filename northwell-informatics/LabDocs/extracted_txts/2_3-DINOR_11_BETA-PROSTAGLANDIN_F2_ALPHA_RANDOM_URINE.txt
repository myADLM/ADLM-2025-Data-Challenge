Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of 2,3-
Dinor 11 Beta-Prostaglandin F2 Alpha, Random, Urine
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the procedure for the analysis of 2,3-Dinor 11
beta-Prostaglandin F2 alpha in random urine specimens. This
protocol ensures consistent, accurate, and reliable results adhering
to CLIA standards.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing
this assay according to the defined procedure.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring that personnel have
received adequate training and that the procedures are adhered
to consistently.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILIZATION
Specimen Type:
• Random urine sample
Volume:
• Minimum volume required: 10 mL
Storage and Stability:
• Preferred immediate analysis.
• If delayed, the urine sample should be refrigerated (2-8°C) and
analyzed within 72 hours.
• For extended storage, freeze the sample at –20°C. Thawed
samples should not be refrozen.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Samples that are collected in containers without a preservative, or
those stored at room temperature beyond the stability period.
• Samples with visible contamination or improper labeling (missing
collection date/time).
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) or Liquid
Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes and Tips
• Vortex mixer
Reagents:
• Calibrators and Controls specific for 2,3-Dinor 11 beta-
Prostaglandin F2 alpha
• Mobile phase solvents (e.g., water, acetonitrile, methanol, formic
acid, etc.)
• Internal Standards
Supplies:
• Syringe filters
• HPLC/LC-MS/MS columns
• Sample vials
1. PROCEDURE
A) Sample Preparation:
1. Thaw frozen specimens to room temperature. Mix well to
ensure homogeneity.
2. Centrifuge at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes to remove any
particulate matter.
3. Aliquot 1 mL of urine into a clean, labeled sample vial.
4. Add an appropriate volume of internal standard solution to the
aliquoted sample.
5. Vortex the mixture for 30 seconds.
6. Filter the sample through a syringe filter directly into an HPLC/
LC-MS/MS vial.
B) Calibration and Quality Control:
1. Prepare calibration standards and quality control samples using
the same matrix as the unknown specimens.
2. Ensure all calibrators and controls are treated as per the
sample preparation steps.
C) Instrument Setup and Parameters:
1. Set up the HPLC/LC-MS/MS system according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Input the chromatographic conditions, including column type,
mobile phase composition, gradient program, and flow rate.
3. Input the mass spectrometer settings for ionization and
detection of 2,3-Dinor 11 beta-Prostaglandin F2 alpha and
internal standard.
D) Analysis:
1. Inject calibrators, quality controls, and urine samples into the
HPLC/LC-MS/MS system.
2. Monitor the chromatographic run to ensure proper peak
integration and separation.
3. Use the system’s software to quantify the 2,3-Dinor 11 beta-
Prostaglandin F2 alpha based on the calibration curve.
E) Data Review and Reporting:
1. Review the calibration curves and ensure that all quality control
samples are within acceptable ranges.
2. Evaluate the chromatograms of patient samples for peak
identification and quantification.
3. Enter the results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
for final review and verification.
4. Report results according to site-specific reporting guidelines.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run quality control samples at the beginning of each batch, after
every 20 specimens, and at the end of each batch.
• Acceptable QC ranges must be established and adhered to. If
controls fall outside these ranges, investigate and resolve before
reporting patient results.
• Document all quality control activities in the quality control log.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's operational manuals for HPLC/LC-MS/MS
instruments.
• Product inserts for calibrators and quality control materials.
• Relevant peer-reviewed scientific literature and guidelines from
recognized regulatory agencies.
7. REFERENCES
Potential references can include:
• Manufacturer’s instructions for the analytical instruments and
reagents.

of prostaglandins.
8. REVISION LOG
• Version history and details of changes made to the protocol for
continuous improvement and updates.
Note: This SOP must be reviewed annually or upon any significant
change to the process, equipment, or reagents used. It should be
revised by the Quality Assurance (QA) team and approved by the
Laboratory Director.
