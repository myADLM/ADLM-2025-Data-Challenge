Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): HMG-CoA Reductase, Serum
Analysis
1. PURPOSE
This protocol provides the standardized procedure for the analysis of
3-Hydroxy-3-Methylglutaryl Coenzyme-A (HMG-CoA) Reductase
levels in serum samples. This analysis is critical for diagnosing and
monitoring disorders related to cholesterol metabolism.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory personnel will perform the analysis in
accordance with this SOP. It is the responsibility of all staff to ensure
the accuracy and reliability of the test results and to report any
irregularities to a supervisor immediately.
1. DEFINITIONS
HMG-CoA Reductase: An enzyme that plays a crucial role in the
biosynthesis of cholesterol and is a potential marker in the monitoring
of hypercholesterolemia and statin use.
1. PROCEDURE
Specimen Requirements: Preferred Specimen: Serum collected in a
red-top or serum separator tube (SST). Volume: Minimum 2 mL of
serum is required for the test. Stability: Refrigerated (2-8°C): Stable
for 5 days. Frozen (-20°C or below): Stable for up to 3 months.
Recommended to avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
Reagents and Supplies: HMG-CoA Reductase assay kit (Ensure it is
within the expiry date). Calibrators and Controls (Low, Normal, and
High levels). Pipettes and tips. Centrifuge. Microplate reader
(appropriate for the assay).
Procedure: Serum Preparation: Allow the blood sample to clot for 30
minutes at room temperature. Centrifuge the sample at 1500 x g for
10 minutes. Carefully transfer the serum into a clean polypropylene
tube, avoiding hemolysis.
Reagent Preparation: Prepare all reagents, calibrators, and controls
as per the manufacturer's instructions (Refer to the package insert for
detailed steps).
Assay Procedure:
1. Add the required volume of serum, calibrators, and controls to
the assay wells.
2. Add the appropriate reagent(s) to each well according to the
assay protocol.
3. Incubate the plate as specified in the kit insert (time and
temperature will vary depending on the assay).
4. Measure the absorbance or fluorescence using a microplate
reader.
5. Calculate the HMG-CoA Reductase levels in the serum
samples based on the calibration curve generated from the
calibrators.
Quality Control: Perform quality control procedures with each batch
of tests. Include Low, Normal, and High controls in each assay run.
QC results must fall within the acceptable range defined by the
manufacturer. If the QC results are out of range, troubleshoot and
repeat the assay as necessary.
Reporting Results: The results should be automatically or manually
entered into the Laboratory Information System (LIS) after verification
by the technologist. Evaluate the results against the reference
intervals provided in the assay kit insert. Flag any results that are
outside the normal range and notify the appropriate healthcare
provider as per the laboratory protocol.
Reference Intervals: Reference intervals should be established
according to the specific population and clinical guidelines. Refer to
the assay kit insert for suggested reference ranges.
Method Limitations: Refer to the HMG-CoA Reductase assay kit
insert for limitations of the methodology. Potential interferences (e.g.,
hemolysis, lipemia, icterus) should be noted and samples showing
significant interference considered for repeat analysis or flagged
accordingly.
