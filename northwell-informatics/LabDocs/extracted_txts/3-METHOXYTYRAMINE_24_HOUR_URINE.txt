Standard Operating Procedure for 3-Methoxytyramine, 24 Hour,
Urine Analysis
1. PURPOSE
To provide guidelines to accurately measure 3-Methoxytyramine in a
24-hour urine specimen using high-performance liquid
chromatography (HPLC) coupled with electrochemical detection
(ED).
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to the measurement of 3-Methoxytyramine in
24-hour urine samples submitted to the laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of designated laboratory personnel to ensure
the proper execution of this protocol, including sample preparation,
analysis, and quality control.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
4.1 Preferred Specimen Type:
• 24-hour urine collection without preservatives.
4.2 Collection Container:
• Use a clean, properly labeled plastic container with no
preservatives. Ensure container is free from any contaminants.
4.3 Specimen Volume:
• A minimum of 25 mL urine from the 24-hour collection is required
for analysis.
4.4 Storage:
• Refrigerate the sample during and after the collection. The sample
must be analyzed within 48 hours if stored at 2-8°C or within 1
month if stored frozen at -20°C.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system
• Electrochemical detector (ED)
• Centrifuge
• Sample vials
• Pipettes and tips
• pH meter
• Methanol (HPLC grade)
• Deionized water
• Mobile phase buffer (specific to HPLC system)
• Calibration standards for 3-Methoxytyramine
6. REAGENTS PREPARATION
6.1 Mobile Phase:
• Prepare the mobile phase according to the specific HPLC system
requirements and buffer components.
6.2 Calibration Standards:
• Prepare calibration standards for 3-Methoxytyramine in
appropriate solvent ranging from low to high concentrations to
cover the expected range in urine samples.
7. PROCEDURE
7.1 Precautions:
• Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) including
gloves, lab coat, and eye protection.
• Ensure all reagents and equipment are clean and properly
calibrated.
7.2 Sample Preparation:
1. Mix the collected 24-hour urine sample thoroughly.
2. Measure the total volume of the urine collection.
3. Aliquot 25 mL of the well-mixed urine sample into a clean
sample vial.
4. Centrifuge the aliquot at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes to remove
any particulates.
5. Use supernatant for the HPLC analysis.
7.3 HPLC Analysis:
1. Turn on the HPLC system and electrochemical detector,
allowing sufficient time for stabilization as per manufacturer's
instructions.
2. Load the mobile phase and set the HPLC pump to the specified
flow rate.
3. Prepare the sample injection sequence, including calibration
standards, quality controls, and urine samples.
4. Inject calibration standards first, followed by quality control
samples, and then the urine samples.
5. Collect and record the chromatographic data for each injection.
8. CALCULATIONS AND DATA ANALYSIS
1. Generate a calibration curve by plotting the peak area of the
calibration standards against their known concentrations.
2. Calculate the concentration of 3-Methoxytyramine in the urine
samples based on the calibration curve.
3. Adjust the concentration for the total volume of the 24-hour
urine collection to report the final result.
9. QUALITY CONTROL
9.1 Internal Quality Control:
• Analyze quality control samples with known concentrations of 3-
Methoxytyramine to ensure the accuracy and precision of the
HPLC analysis.
• Run at least one high, medium, and low concentration quality
control sample in each batch of urine samples.
9.2 External Calibration Verification:
• Periodically verify the accuracy of the calibration standards by
comparing with a secondary source of known concentration.
10. REPORTING RESULTS
Report the concentration of 3-Methoxytyramine in micromoles per 24
hours (µmol/24 hours) or nanomoles per 24 hours (nmol/24 hours) as
appropriate based on the reference range and clinical requirements.
11. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the HPLC system and electrochemical detector manuals for
any specific limitations regarding the detection of 3-Methoxytyramine.
Factors such as interfering substances, pH, and instrument sensitivity
should be considered.

13. DOCUMENTATION
All data including sample information, calibration curve, quality
control results, and final results must be properly documented and
reviewed before reporting. Ensure compliance with lab policies and
regulatory standards.
By following these outlined steps, accurate and reproducible
measurements of 3-Methoxytyramine in 24-hour urine samples can
be achieved, ensuring quality and reliability of test results.
