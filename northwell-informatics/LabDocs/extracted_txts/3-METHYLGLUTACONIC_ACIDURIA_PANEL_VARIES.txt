Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for 3-Methylglutaconic Aciduria Panel, Varies
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this SOP is to outline the
procedures for the analytical phase of generating results for the
3-Methylglutaconic Aciduria Panel. This includes the
preparation, analysis, and documentation of results to ensure
accuracy and reliability.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory staff are responsible for
performing the analysis, validating results, and documenting findings
according to this SOP. Supervisors are responsible for reviewing and
approving results and any corrective actions taken.
1. DEFINITION The 3-Methylglutaconic Aciduria Panel includes
the analysis of specific metabolites associated with 3-
methylglutaconic aciduria, such as 3-methylglutaconic acid, 3-
methylglutaric acid, and other relevant organic acids.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY Preferred
Specimen:
• Urine: 10-20 mL, fresh or frozen at -20°C
• Plasma: 3-5 mL, lithium heparin or EDTA, frozen at -20°C
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens with hemolysis or clot formation
• Specimens arriving without proper identification and collection
date/time
• Specimens transported outside specified temperature conditions
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) or Liquid
Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS) system
• Calibration standards for 3-methylglutaconic acid, 3-methylglutaric
acid, and other relevant metabolites
• Quality control materials
• Sample preparation kits and solvents
• Vials, syringes, and other necessary labware
1. PROCEDURE Sample Preparation:
• Thaw frozen specimens (if applicable) and bring to room
temperature.
• Prepare calibration standards and quality control samples.
• Dilute urine or plasma samples appropriately, according to the
laboratory protocol.
• Perform necessary extraction steps using sample preparation kits.
Instrument Setup:
• Ensure the GC-MS or LC-MS system is calibrated and functioning
correctly.
• Load the calibration standards, quality control samples, and
patient samples onto the instrument.
Analysis:
• Set the instrument parameters according to the manufacturer’s
instructions and the laboratory protocol.
• Run the samples and acquire data for the specified metabolites.
• Review chromatograms and mass spectra to ensure accurate
peak identification and integration.
Validation and Quality Control:
• Validate results using quality control samples.
• Compare patient sample results to reference intervals and look for
any outliers or anomalies.
• Repeat analysis if necessary, following troubleshooting steps for
instrument errors.
Documentation:
• Record all results in the laboratory information system (LIS).
• Document the date, time, and initials of the staff member who
performed the analysis.
• Log any corrective actions and reanalysis performed.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Generate reports based on the validated results.
• Review and verify results in the LIS.
• Flag and report any critical values or findings to the appropriate
clinical team.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Use two levels of quality control material to ensure the accuracy
of the analysis.
• Perform periodic instrument maintenance and calibration.
• Document all quality control activities in the appropriate log.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• 3-Methylglutaconic acid: Reference interval to be determined by
lab
• 3-Methylglutaric acid: Reference interval to be determined by lab
• Other metabolites: Reference intervals specific to each analyte
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS Refer to the instrument manufacturer’s
instructions and calibration standards for limitations on the
detection and quantitation of individual metabolites.
2. REFERENCES Refer to instrument manuals, calibration
standard inserts, and relevant scientific literature for detailed
procedures and limitations.

Notes:
• Ensure that all steps are performed under appropriate safety and
quality standards.
• Regular training should be provided to all laboratory staff to
maintain high proficiency in performing these procedures.
By following this SOP, the laboratory can ensure accurate and
reliable results for the 3-Methylglutaconic Aciduria Panel, ultimately
aiding in the diagnosis and management of patients with metabolic
disorders.
