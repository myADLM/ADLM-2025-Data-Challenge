Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for 5-FLUCYTOSINE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for the accurate and timely measurement of
5-Flucytosine levels in serum samples, ensuring patient safety and
effective therapeutic monitoring.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
Qualified laboratory staff are responsible for ensuring that all steps in
the determination of 5-Flucytosine in serum are performed correctly
and that all equipment is properly maintained and calibrated. Any
deviations from standard procedures must be documented and
reported to a supervisor.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen Type:
• Preferred: Serum
• Alternate: Plasma (EDTA, Heparin)
Collection:
• Draw blood into a red-top tube (serum) or appropriate tube for
plasma.
• Allow the blood to clot at room temperature.
• Centrifuge the sample to separate serum/plasma.
Volume Required:
• Minimum: 2 mL of serum or plasma
Stability:
• Room Temperature: 24 hours
• Refrigerated (2-8°C): 7 days
• Frozen (-20°C or lower): 1 month
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed specimens
• Specimens collected in tubes with anticoagulants other than
EDTA or Heparin
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) system
• Mobile Phase: Pre-mixed and filtered
• 5-Flucytosine Standard
• Calibration and Quality Control (QC) solutions
• Appropriate HPLC column
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes and tips
• Vortex mixer
• Sample vials and caps
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation of Standards and Quality Controls
1. Prepare a calibration curve using 5-Flucytosine standard
solutions at concentrations ranging from 1 to 50 µg/mL.
2. Prepare Quality Control (QC) samples at low, medium, and high
concentrations within the therapeutic range.
B. Sample Preparation
1. Ensure all samples are properly labeled with patient identifiers.
2. Thaw frozen specimens at room temperature if necessary.
3. Vortex each serum or plasma sample for 15 seconds to ensure
homogeneity.
4. If necessary, dilute the sample with the mobile phase to bring
within the calibration range.
C. HPLC Analysis
1. Set up the HPLC system according to the manufacturer's
instructions and ensure it is calibrated and suitable for use.
2. Inject a blank sample, calibration standards, and QC samples
to verify the system's performance.
3. Inject 20 µL of each patient serum/plasma sample into the
HPLC system.
D. Data Collection and Interpretation
1. Measure the peak area of 5-Flucytosine in each sample's
chromatogram.
2. Use the calibration curve to determine the concentration of 5-
Flucytosine in each sample.
3. Validate the accuracy of results by ensuring that QC samples
are within ±15% of their nominal values.
4. REPORTING RESULTS
5. Results are automatically transmitted to the Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
6. Results should be reviewed and verified by a qualified
technologist.
7. Critical values should follow the laboratory’s critical value
reporting guidelines and be communicated to the physician
immediately.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
Internal Quality Control
• Run QC samples at low, medium, and high concentrations with
each batch of patient samples.
• Acceptable ranges for QC samples should be established and
regularly reviewed.
External Quality Assessment
• Participate in external proficiency testing programs if available.
Troubleshooting:
• If QC samples fall outside acceptable ranges, investigate and
correct any issues before reporting patient results.
• Document all corrective actions taken in response to QC failures.
