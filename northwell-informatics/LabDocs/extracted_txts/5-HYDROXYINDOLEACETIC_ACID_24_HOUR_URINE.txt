Protocol for the Analytical Phase of Generating Results for 5-
HYDROXYINDOLEACETIC ACID, 24 HOUR, URINE
1. PURPOSE
To establish a standardized procedure for the analysis and reporting
of 5-Hydroxyindoleacetic Acid (5-HIAA) in 24-hour urine samples to
ensure accuracy and reproducibility of results.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory technologist to
perform the analysis and ensure results are accurately reported.
2. DEFINITION
5-Hydroxyindoleacetic Acid (5-HIAA) is a primary metabolite of
serotonin, which is measured in urine to help diagnose and monitor
carcinoid tumors.
3. PROCEDURE
Specimen Requirements:
• The urine specimen must be a 24-hour collection.
• The container should be kept refrigerated during the collection
period.
• Preservatives such as hydrochloric acid (HCl) may be added to
the collection container to prevent degradation of 5-HIAA.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Incomplete 24-hour urine collections.
• Specimens that are not refrigerated during collection.
• Specimens with inadequate volume as specified by the
laboratory’s minimum requirement.
• Specimens without proper labeling indicating start and end of the
collection period.
Pre-Analytical Considerations:
• Once received, confirm that the specimen volume is accurately
measured and recorded.
• Check the record to ensure proper collection times and
preservatives were used.
• Mix the sample thoroughly before aliquoting.
Reagents, Supplies, and Equipment:
• High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) apparatus.
• Mobile phase reagents as specified by the method (e.g.,
acetonitrile, water, buffer solutions).
• 5-HIAA standard for calibration.
• Internal standard solution, if applicable.
• Appropriate column for HPLC.
• Calibration curves and quality control materials (low, medium,
high concentrations).
• Sample preparation materials such as pipettes, vial, filters, etc.
Preparation and Analysis:
1. Sample Preparation: a. Pipette a predefined aliquot of urine
(usually 2-5 mL) into a clean tube. b. If required, dilute the
aliquot with a specific volume of water or buffer solution. c. Add
the internal standard according to the laboratory method. d. Mix
the sample thoroughly and filter if necessary.
2. Calibration and Quality Control: a. Prepare calibration
standards of 5-HIAA in the same matrix as the urine samples.
b. Include quality control materials in each batch that are
processed similarly to patient specimens. c. Load calibration
standards, quality controls, and patient samples onto the HPLC
system.
3. Analysis: a. Set up the HPLC system with the appropriate
column and mobile phase. b. Establish the detection
wavelength specific for 5-HIAA (e.g., UV detection at 280 nm).
c. Perform the analysis according to the validated HPLC
method. d. Ensure retention times and peak shapes of
standards, controls, and samples are consistent.
4. Post-Analysis: a. Generate chromatograms and integrate
peaks for 5-HIAA concentration. b. Verify that the calibration
curve meets acceptance criteria. c. Calculate the 5-HIAA
concentration in each urine sample using the calibration curve.
d. Ensure quality control results are within established limits
before reporting patient results.
Reporting Results:
• Results will be reported in mg/24 hr.
• Reference interval typically considered: 2-8 mg/24 hr.
• For results outside reference intervals, follow laboratory policy for
critical value reporting and documentation.
Quality Control:
• Perform regular quality control checks as dictated by the
laboratory's internal schedule.
• Participate in proficiency testing programs to ensure ongoing
accuracy and comparability of results.
• Document all quality control and proficiency testing activities
thoroughly.
Method Limitations:
• Discuss potential interferences, such as medications or dietary
factors (e.g., bananas, avocados, and nuts), that might affect
results.
• Note any limitations regarding the minimum detectable level or
upper limits of quantification.
