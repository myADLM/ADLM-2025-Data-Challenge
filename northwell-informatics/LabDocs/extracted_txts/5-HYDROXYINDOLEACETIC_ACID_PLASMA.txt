Protocol for Analytical Processing and Reporting of 5-
Hydroxyindoleacetic Acid (5-HIAA) in Plasma
1. PURPOSE To establish standardized procedures for the
determination of 5-Hydroxyindoleacetic Acid (5-HIAA) levels in
plasma samples.
2. SCOPE This protocol applies to the clinical biochemistry laboratory
where 5-HIAA testing is conducted. It involves the analytical phase of
generating and reporting 5-HIAA results in plasma.
3. RESPONSIBILITY Designated laboratory personnel will carry out
the analytical process and maintain proper documentation for 5-HIAA
testing. Laboratory supervisors are responsible for ensuring that all
procedures are followed, and corrective actions are taken when
necessary.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred Specimen: Plasma collected in EDTA or heparinized
tubes.
• Specimen Storage: Plasma should be separated from the cells as
soon as possible and stored at -20°C or lower.
• Stability: Plasma is stable 8 hours at room temperature, 7 days
refrigerated (2-8°C), and up to 6 months frozen (-20°C).
5. REAGENTS AND MATERIALS
• Reagents:
◦ Analytical grade solvents
◦ 5-HIAA standards and control materials
◦ Mobile phase (e.g., aqueous buffer, organic modifiers)
• Equipment and Supplies:
◦ High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system or
appropriate analytic system
◦ Centrifuge
◦ Pipettes and tips
◦ Sample vials
◦ Calibration curve and control samples
6. PROCEDURE
A. Calibration and Quality Control:
1. Calibration:
◦ Prepare a calibration curve using 5-HIAA standard solutions.
◦ Ensure the calibration curve covers the expected range of
patient results.
◦ Perform the calibration according to the HPLC system
manufacturer's instructions.
2. Quality Control:
◦ Analyze quality control samples at the start of each run.
◦ Include both low and high control levels.
◦ Ensure controls fall within established ranges before
proceeding.
B. Sample Preparation:
1. Thaw frozen plasma samples at room temperature and mix
thoroughly.
2. Centrifuge samples at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes to remove any
particulate matter.
3. Pipette the clear supernatant into a clean sample vial.
C. Analytical Measurement:
1. Setting Up HPLC:
◦ Equilibrate the HPLC system as per manufacturer
instructions.
◦ Load sample vials, calibration standards, and control
samples onto the autosampler.
2. Injection:
◦ Program the HPLC system to inject appropriate volume for
analysis.
3. Elution and Detection:
◦ Set appropriate mobile phase gradient and flow rate.
◦ Analyze samples using a fluorescence detector set at
specific excitation and emission wavelengths for 5-HIAA.
4. Data Collection and Analysis:
◦ Record chromatograms and peak areas.
◦ Calculate 5-HIAA concentrations using the calibration curve.
D. Reporting Results:
1. Verify that the assay controls are within the acceptable range.
2. Review data for any anomalies or discrepancies.
3. Automatically transmit validated results to the LIS.
4. Interpret and report results according to laboratory reporting
guidelines.
5. Critical results should be reviewed and verified before reporting.
Follow laboratory policy for handling and communicating critical
values.
7. RESULTS VALIDATION AND QUALITY ASSURANCE
• Participate in external quality assurance programs.
• Conduct periodic review of assay performance and recalibrate if
necessary.
• Document all calibrations, controls, and maintenance activities.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolyzed samples may interfere with assay accuracy.
• Note any deviations from standard protocols that may impact
results.
