Standard Operating Procedure for the Analysis of 5-
Hydroxyindoleacetic Acid (5-HIAA) in Random Urine
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to provide standardized instructions
and procedures for the accurate and precise analysis of 5-
Hydroxyindoleacetic Acid (5-HIAA) in random urine samples.
This will ensure the reliability and reproducibility of test results.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to the analysis of 5-HIAA in random
urine samples collected for the diagnosis and monitoring of
carcinoid tumors and other neuroendocrine tumors.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
All laboratory personnel conducting the analysis of 5-HIAA in
urine are responsible for following this SOP. The Laboratory
Manager is responsible for overseeing compliance with this
SOP.
4. DEFINITIONS
5-HIAA: 5-Hydroxyindoleacetic Acid, a metabolite of serotonin.
Analysis: The process of measuring the concentration of 5-
HIAA in random urine samples using the specified equipment
and reagents.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
◦ High-Performance Liquid Chromatograph (HPLC) or LC-MS/
MS
◦ Urine collection containers
◦ 5-HIAA standard solution
◦ Mobile phase solvents (e.g., water, acetonitrile, methanol)
◦ Calibration standards
◦ Quality control materials
◦ Sample preparation reagents (e.g., buffers, derivatizing
agents)
◦ Volumetric pipettes and tips
◦ Centrifuge
◦ Disposable gloves and lab coat
6. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
◦ Random urine sample collected in a clean, plastic container
without preservatives.
◦ A minimum volume of 10 mL urine is required.
◦ Specimens should be refrigerated immediately after
collection and transported to the laboratory on ice.
◦ Samples are stable for up to 24 hours at 4°C or up to 3
months at -20°C if longer storage is needed.
7. PROCEDURE
7.1 Sample Preparation
◦ Thaw frozen samples at room temperature if applicable.
◦ Mix the urine sample thoroughly.
◦ Centrifuge the sample at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes to remove
particulate matter.
◦ Transfer the supernatant into a clean tube for analysis.
7.2 Calibration and Quality Control
◦ Prepare calibration standards at multiple concentrations
(e.g., 0, 1, 5, 10, 20 mg/L) by diluting the 5-HIAA standard
solution.
◦ Prepare quality control samples at low, medium, and high
concentrations.
◦ Run calibration standards and quality control samples at the
beginning, middle, and end of each analytical run.
7.3 Instrument Setup
◦ Set up the HPLC or LC-MS/MS according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
◦ Program the instrument with the appropriate method
parameters (e.g., solvent composition, flow rate, detection
wavelength).
◦ Prime and equilibrate the system with the mobile phase.
7.4 Analytical Run
◦ Inject the prepared urine samples, calibration standards,
and quality control samples into the HPLC or LC-MS/MS
system.
◦ Ensure each sample run includes at least one blank, one
quality control sample, and the calibration standards.
◦ Record the retention time and peak area for each injection.
7.5 Calculations
◦ Plot the calibration curve using the peak area against the
known concentrations of the calibration standards.
◦ Determine the concentration of 5-HIAA in the urine samples
by comparing the sample peak areas to the calibration
curve.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ Review and verify the results to ensure they meet the
laboratory's quality control criteria.
◦ Record the final concentration of 5-HIAA in the laboratory
information system (LIS).
◦ Report results according to site-specific guidelines.
9. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Run quality control material with each batch of patient
samples.
◦ Acceptable limits for quality control results must be within ±2
standard deviations of the target value.
◦ Investigate and resolve any quality control failures before
reporting results.
10. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Reference interval for 5-HIAA: Less than 6.0 mg/24 hours
(optimal ranges may vary; refer to laboratory-specific reference
intervals).
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hematuria, high concentrations of certain drugs, and consumption
of serotonin-rich foods may interfere with the analysis.
• Ensure samples are free from interfering substances or note any
limitations in the report.
