Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for 5-Methyltetrahydrofolate (5-MTHF)
1. PURPOSE:
The purpose of this protocol is to outline the step-by-step procedures
for the analytical phase of generating results for 5-
Methyltetrahydrofolate (5-MTHF), a critical coenzyme in the
metabolism of amino acids and nucleotides. Accurate measurement
of 5-MTHF is essential for diagnosing and monitoring various health
conditions related to folate metabolism.
2. SCOPE:
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel who will be involved in
the analysis of 5-MTHF within our CLIA-certified laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY:
It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory staff to follow this
SOP for 5-MTHF measurement. Laboratory supervisors are
responsible for ensuring compliance with this procedure and
addressing any deviations.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS:
• Specimen Type: Whole blood, plasma, or serum.
• Specimen Volume: Minimum 1 mL.
• Specimen Collection: Blood should be drawn and transferred
into a tube containing an appropriate anticoagulant like EDTA.
• Specimen Handling: Samples must be protected from light and
stored at 2-8°C if not immediately analyzed. For long-term
storage, samples should be frozen at -20°C or lower.
• Unacceptable Specimens: Specimens with significant hemolysis
or those not stored/prepared properly.
5. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS:
• Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)
system
• Calibrated pipettes and tips
• Centrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Nitrogen evaporator
• 5-Methyltetrahydrofolate calibration standards and quality controls
• Mobile phase reagents (e.g., methanol, water, formic acid)
• Sample preparation reagents (e.g., acetonitrile, internal standard
solution)
• Sample vials and caps
• Protective lab wear, including gloves and lab coat
6. PROCEDURE:
6.1 Sample Preparation:
1. Plasma/Serum Separation:
◦ Centrifuge whole blood tubes at 1500 g for 10 minutes at
4°C.
◦ Carefully transfer the plasma/serum to a new labeled tube,
avoiding the buffy coat.
2. Proteins Precipitation:
◦ Add 100 µL of plasma/serum to a clean microtube.
◦ Add 300 µL of acetonitrile (containing the internal standard)
to the sample. Vortex mix for 30 seconds.
◦ Incubate the mixture at 4°C for 10 minutes.
◦ Centrifuge the sample at 10,000 g for 10 minutes at 4°C.
3. Supernatant Transfer:
◦ Carefully transfer the clear supernatant to a new labeled
vial.
◦ Dry the supernatant under a stream of nitrogen at room
temperature.
4. Reconstitution:
◦ Reconstitute the dried sample with 100 µL of the mobile
phase (methanol:water 50:50 with 0.1% formic acid).
◦ Vortex mix for 1 minute.
◦ Transfer the reconstituted sample to an LC-MS/MS vial and
cap the vial.
6.2 LC-MS/MS Analysis:
1. Instrument Preparation:
◦ Ensure the LC-MS/MS system is calibrated and ready for
analysis.
◦ Prepare the mobile phase and ensure the solvent reservoirs
are filled.
2. Sample Injection:
◦ Load the prepared sample vials into the autosampler tray.
◦ Set the LC-MS/MS to run the method specific for 5-MTHF
analysis.
◦ Inject 10-20 µL of the sample into the LC-MS/MS system.
3. Data Acquisition:
◦ Start the LC-MS/MS run and acquire data according to the
instrument’s software settings.
◦ Monitor the system for any alerts or errors during the run.
6.3 Data Analysis and Interpretation:
1. Calibration and Quality Control:
◦ Analyze calibration standards and quality controls along with
the patient samples.
◦ Verify that the calibration curve is linear and within the
acceptable range.
◦ Ensure QC values are within the predetermined acceptable
limits.
2. Calculating Results:
◦ Use the instrument’s software to calculate the concentration
of 5-MTHF in the patient samples based on the calibration
curve.
◦ Review the raw data and integration to ensure accurate
peak identification and quantitation.
3. Result Review:
◦ Validate the calculated results and ensure all QC
parameters are met.
◦ Document any deviations or issues encountered during
analysis.
7. QUALITY CONTROL:
• Perform QC checks with each batch of patient samples.
• Include at least two levels of QC materials (low and high) in each
run.
• Document all QC results in the appropriate logbook or electronic
system.
• Investigate and resolve any QC failures before reporting patient
results.
8. REPORTING RESULTS:
• Results should be entered into the LIS (Laboratory Information
System) and reviewed by a qualified technologist.
• Any critical values should be promptly communicated to the
responsible healthcare provider according to the laboratory's
notification policy.
9. MAINTENANCE AND CALIBRATION:
• Perform regular maintenance of the LC-MS/MS system as
specified by the manufacturer's guidelines.
• Calibrate the system with each new batch of reagents or as
required for accurate performance.
10. REFERENCES:
• Instrument manufacturer’s user manual and maintenance guides.
• Internal laboratory policies and procedures for LC-MS/MS
operation and maintenance.
• Relevant clinical guidelines and literature on 5-MTHF analysis.
11. DOCUMENTATION:
• Maintain detailed records of all samples processed, including
preparation steps and results.
• Document all QC results and any corrective actions taken.
• Archive all maintenance logs and calibration records for future
reference.
12. SAFETY:
• Follow standard laboratory safety protocols, including the use of
personal protective equipment (PPE).
• Dispose of all reagents and materials according to safety and
environmental regulations.
By adhering to this protocol, we ensure the reliability and accuracy of
5-Methyltetrahydrofolate measurements, thereby supporting effective
patient care and clinical decision-making.
