Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analysis of 5'-
Nucleotidase
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for the analysis of 5'-Nucleotidase activity in
patient samples in order to ensure accurate, reliable, and
reproducible test results.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of all trained laboratory personnel to follow this
SOP and any manufacturer’s guidelines for using the equipment and
reagents as described.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred Specimen:
• Serum or lithium heparinized plasma
Collection and Handling:
• Collect blood specimens using standard venipuncture technique
into appropriate collection tubes.
• Allow blood to clot at room temperature (for serum) or mix gently
by inversion (for plasma).
• Centrifuge the sample at 1500x g for 10 minutes to separate the
serum/plasma from cells as soon as possible after collection.
• Transfer the serum/plasma to a clean, labeled aliquot tube.
• Samples should be stored at 2-8°C if the testing is to be
conducted within 48 hours. For longer storage, freeze specimens
at -20°C or colder.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed samples (hemolysis can interfere with the assay).
• Samples collected in tubes containing EDTA, citrate, or fluoride
which can interfere with enzyme activity.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• 5'-Nucleotidase reagent kit (manufacturer specified)
• Calibrator and control materials
• Automated chemistry analyzer capable of performing enzyme
assays
• Pipettes and tips
• Centrifuge
• Timer
• Labeling materials
• Gloves and personal protective equipment (PPE)
4. PROCEDURE
A) Daily Instrument Setup and Calibration:
1. Power on the analyzer and perform any daily maintenance as
per the manufacturer’s guidelines.
2. Calibrate the analyzer using the calibration standards provided
with the reagent kit. Follow the analyzer’s software prompts and
manufacturer's instructions.
3. Verify calibration by running quality control (QC) samples at
multiple levels (low, medium, and high), making sure control
results fall within the manufacturer’s specified range.
B) Sample Preparation:
1. Ensure all reagents, calibrators, and control materials are
brought to room temperature before use.
2. Check the sample for any signs of hemolysis or contamination.
Reject unsuitable samples.
C) Operation/The Analytical Run:
1. Load samples, calibrators, and controls onto the analyzer.
2. Select the 5'-Nucleotidase assay protocol from the analyzer’s
menu.
3. Follow the software prompts to start the run.
D) Post-Analysis:
1. Once the assay is complete, review and validate results
produced by the analyzer.
2. Compare QC results against acceptable ranges to ensure the
validity of the assay run. If QC results are not within acceptable
limits, troubleshoot the assay and recalibrate/re-run the
analysis as necessary.
3. Ensure that results for patient samples are checked for
inconsistencies and flagged appropriately if abnormalities are
detected.
5. REPORTING RESULTS
1. The results should be automatically transferred to the
Laboratory Information System (LIS) for review.
2. Validate and verify the results in the LIS, ensuring accurate
input and appropriate flagging of critical values.
3. Report results according to site-specific guidelines, ensuring
that any comments relevant to sample quality or assay
performance are included.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Run QC materials at the start of each day, with each new
reagent lot, and with each new calibration.
2. Monitor QC trends using Levey-Jennings charts; investigate,
correct, and document any outliers.
3. Participate in external proficiency testing as required.
7. METHOD LIMITATIONS
1. Hemolysis or high bilirubin levels may interfere with the assay.
2. Ensuring the prompt separation of serum/plasma is crucial to
prevent cell metabolism from affecting 5'-Nucleotidase levels.
3. Refer to the reagent kit insert for specific limitations and
interferences.
8. RECORD KEEPING AND DOCUMENTATION
1. Maintain records of calibration, QC results, and maintenance
logs according to laboratory policy.
2. Document any assay problems, corrective actions, and any
deviations from the SOP.
