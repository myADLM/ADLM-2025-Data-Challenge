Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for 6-Monoacetylmorphine
(6-MAM) Confirmation in Meconium – Chain of Custody
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the procedures for the analytical phase of
generating results for 6-monoacetylmorphine (6-MAM) confirmation
in meconium samples. This includes extraction, analysis by liquid
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), and
reporting of results, all while maintaining strict chain of custody
protocols.
2. SCOPE
This SOP is applicable to all laboratory personnel trained in LC-MS/
MS analysis and handling chain of custody samples. It covers the
procedures from sample preparation through to final data analysis
and result reporting.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
Responsible personnel:
• Laboratory Technicians/Scientists: Conduct sample preparation,
extraction, and analysis.
• Quality Control (QC) Officers: Ensure all procedures follow
standard guidelines and perform QC checks.
• Laboratory Supervisors/Managers: Oversee workflow, ensure
compliance with chain of custody protocols, and authorize result
release.
4. DEFINITIONS
Chain of Custody - Documentation process ensuring the integrity of
samples from collection to analysis and reporting.
6-MAM - 6-monoacetylmorphine, a specific biomarker of heroin use.
Meconium - The first feces of a newborn, used for toxicological
analysis.
Analytical Phase - Procedures involving the preparation, analysis,
and verification of samples and results.
5. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
5.1 Equipment
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes and tips
• Vortex mixer
• LC-MS/MS system
• Analytical balance
• Calibrated refrigerator and freezer
5.2 Reagents
• Certified 6-MAM standard
• Internal standards (e.g., deuterated 6-MAM)
• MeOH (methanol)
• ACN (acetonitrile)
• Formic acid
• LC-MS grade water
• Extraction solvent (e.g., liquid-liquid extraction solvents)
6. PROCEDURE
6.1 Chain of Custody Handling
• On receiving the meconium sample, document the sample
condition, collection date and time, and any identifiers on the
Chain of Custody form.
• Store the sample at -20°C until ready for analysis.
• Ensure every transfer and handling step of the sample is
documented in the Chain of Custody log.
6.2 Sample Preparation
• Thaw the meconium sample at room temperature.
• Weigh approximately 0.5 grams of the meconium sample and
transfer it to an appropriately labeled tube.
• Add internal standards to the sample.
• Add an appropriate amount of extraction solvent, vortex mix for 1
minute, and then centrifuge at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes.
• Transfer the supernatant to a clean evaporation tube and
evaporate to dryness under a gentle stream of nitrogen.
6.3 LC-MS/MS Analysis
• Reconstitute the dried residue in an aliquot of mobile phase.
• Filter the reconstituted solution using a 0.22-micron filter.
• Transfer the filtered solution to an LC-MS/MS vial for analysis.
• Set up the LC-MS/MS system with appropriate method
parameters for the detection of 6-MAM.
• Run QC samples (blanks, low, medium, and high concentration
standards) to ensure instrument performance.
• Inject the prepared sample and internal standards into the LC-MS/
MS system.
6.4 Data Analysis and Result Confirmation
• Analyze the chromatograms with appropriate software.
• Calculate the concentration of 6-MAM in the sample using
calibration curves.
• Ensure that all result calculations meet acceptable criteria (e.g.,
R2 > 0.99).
• Perform a second analyst review of the results for confirmation.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Ensure that quality control samples are run at the beginning and
end of each analytical batch.
• Review all QC results and ensure they are within acceptable limits
before proceeding with sample analysis.
• Document all QC activities within the appropriate log.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Verify that results are accurate and reviewed by at least two
analysts.
• Complete a final review of the Chain of Custody documentation to
ensure integrity.
• Report the results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Authorize the results for release by a laboratory supervisor or
manager.
