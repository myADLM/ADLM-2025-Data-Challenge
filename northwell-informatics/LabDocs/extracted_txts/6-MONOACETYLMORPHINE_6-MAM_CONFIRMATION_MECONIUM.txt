Standard Operating Procedure for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for 6-Monoacetylmorphine (6-MAM)
Confirmation in Meconium
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to establish a standardized procedure for
the confirmation analysis of 6-Monoacetylmorphine (6-MAM) in
meconium samples using high-performance liquid chromatography-
tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) or gas chromatography-
mass spectrometry (GC-MS). This SOP aims to ensure accurate,
reliable, and reproducible results for the confirmation of 6-MAM in
meconium.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
Personnel performing the analysis and reporting of results are
responsible for following this SOP. It is the responsibility of the
laboratory manager to ensure that all personnel are trained in this
procedure and to periodically review and update the SOP as needed.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred Specimen: Meconium collected from neonates.
• Specimen Volume: Minimum of 2 grams of meconium.
• Specimen Collection: Collect meconium specimen using a sterile,
leak-proof container.
• Specimen Storage: Store collected meconium at -20°C until
analysis.
• Specimen Transport: Ship meconium specimens on dry ice to
preserve sample integrity.
4. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• HPLC-MS/MS or GC-MS system
• Analytical balance
• Centrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Sonicator
• Pipettes and tips
• Glass or polypropylene tubes
• Meconium extraction buffer
• Solid phase extraction (SPE) columns
• Mobile phase solvents (e.g., water, acetonitrile, formic acid)
• 6-MAM standards and internal standards
• Quality control materials
5. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation
1. Thaw the meconium sample at room temperature.
2. Weigh approximately 0.5 grams of meconium into a glass or
polypropylene tube.
3. Add 5 mL of meconium extraction buffer to the tube.
4. Vortex the mixture for 1 minute.
5. Sonicate the tube for 15 minutes at room temperature.
6. Centrifuge the tube at 4000 rpm for 10 minutes.
7. Collect the supernatant into a clean tube.
B. Solid Phase Extraction (SPE)
1. Condition the SPE column with 3 mL of methanol followed by 3
mL of water.
2. Load the supernatant onto the SPE column.
3. Wash the column with 3 mL of water followed by 3 mL of 10%
methanol in water.
4. Elute the analytes with 3 mL of methanol.
5. Evaporate the eluent to dryness under a stream of nitrogen.
6. Reconstitute the dried residue in 200 µL of mobile phase (e.g.,
50:50 water:acetonitrile).
C. Instrumental Analysis (HPLC-MS/MS or GC-MS)
1. Set up the HPLC-MS/MS or GC-MS system according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
2. Inject 10 µL of the reconstituted extract into the system.
3. Use the following conditions for HPLC-MS/MS (example):
◦ Column: C18 reverse-phase
◦ Mobile Phase: Gradient elution with water and acetonitrile
containing 0.1% formic acid
◦ Flow Rate: 0.3 mL/min
◦ MS Detection: Positive ion mode, Multiple Reaction
Monitoring (MRM)
◦ Transitions: 6-MAM (e.g., m/z 328 > 165)
D. Calibration and Quality Control
1. Prepare a calibration curve using 6-MAM standards at
concentrations ranging from 1 ng/mL to 100 ng/mL.
2. Include at least one blank, one low, and one high-quality control
sample in each analytical batch.
3. Analyze the quality control samples with each batch to ensure
the accuracy and precision of the assay.
E. Data Analysis and Reporting
1. Quantitate 6-MAM in meconium samples using the calibration
curve.
2. Verify the accuracy of the results by comparing the quality
control sample results to accepted limits.
3. Report the concentration of 6-MAM in the meconium sample.
Results should be expressed in ng/g.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Analyze quality control samples with each batch of specimens to
monitor the accuracy and precision of the assay.
• Periodically participate in external proficiency testing programs.
7. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS
• Handle all specimens and reagents following appropriate
biosafety and chemical safety guidelines.
• Use personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves, lab
coat, and safety glasses.
• Dispose of all waste materials following laboratory safety
protocols.
