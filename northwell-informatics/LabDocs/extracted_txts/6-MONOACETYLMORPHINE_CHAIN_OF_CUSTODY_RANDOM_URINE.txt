Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for 6-
MONOACETYLMORPHINE (6-MAM) Analysis in Urine
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the procedure for the analysis of 6-
Monoacetylmorphine (6-MAM) in urine specimens. The protocol
includes the steps for generating results with strict adherence to
chain of custody requirements for random urine samples.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
• Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the
analysis as per this SOP.
• Laboratory staff must ensure the integrity of the chain of custody
for each specimen.
• Supervisors are responsible for monitoring and documenting
procedural adherence and any corrective actions required.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred Specimen:
• 30 mL of random urine collected in a sterile container without
preservatives.
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Specimen collected in containers with preservatives or additives
not specified in the protocol.
• Specimen volume less than 10 mL.
• Specimen container or requisition missing collection date/time.
Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies:
• Sterile urine collection containers.
• Chain of custody forms.
• Siemens Multistix 10SG or 8SG for preliminary urinalysis.
• Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) or Liquid
Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) for
confirmatory analysis.
• Standard and control reagents specific to 6-MAM analysis.
4. PROCEDURE
Pre-Analytical Phase:
1. Upon receipt, log the specimen into the laboratory information
system (LIS).
2. Verify the integrity of the container and seal. Document on
chain of custody form.
3. Store the specimen in the refrigerator at 2-8°C until time of
analysis.
Analytical Phase:
1. Perform a preliminary urinalysis using Siemens Multistix 10SG
or 8SG.
◦ Completely immerse the reagent strip in urine and remove
immediately.
◦ Start timer and read each pad at the time specified on the
label.
◦ Document results on the urinalysis log.
2. For 6-MAM analysis, proceed with extraction and preparation of
urine sample as follows:
◦ Aliquot 5-10 mL of urine into a labeled centrifuge tube.
◦ Add appropriate internal standard specific to 6-MAM
analysis.
◦ Centrifuge the urine sample at 2500 RPM for 10 minutes to
remove particulates.
◦ Transfer supernatant to a clean vial for further analysis.
3. Set up and calibrate the GC-MS or LC-MS/MS system
according to manufacturer's instructions:
◦ Perform instrument calibration using 6-MAM standards.
◦ Run quality control samples to verify calibration and
accuracy.
4. Inject prepared urine sample into GC-MS or LC-MS/MS for
analysis.
◦ Record chromatogram and mass spectra.
◦ Use established retention times and mass-to-charge ratios
for identification and quantification of 6-MAM.
5. Document findings in analytical log including:
◦ Sample ID, date, time of analysis.
◦ Instrument settings, peak retention time.
◦ Operator initials.
Post-Analytical Phase:
1. Review and verify results in the LIS.
2. Interpret results adhering to cutoff concentrations for 6-MAM
specified by regulatory guidelines.
3. Generate and attach the final report, including chain of custody
documentation.
4. Ensure the report is verified and signed off by a qualified
laboratory supervisor.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform quality control checks with each batch of samples
analyzed.
• Use positive and negative controls specific to 6-MAM analysis.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
• Enter confirmed results into the LIS, ensuring accuracy of data.
• Reports must be reviewed and verified as per site-specific
guidelines.
• Critical results must be communicated according to laboratory
policy.
7. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Reference intervals or cutoff values for 6-MAM will be consistent with
accepted clinical and forensic guidelines.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to manufacturer's insert for limitations specific to GC-MS or LC-
MS/MS analysis for 6-MAM.
9. REFERENCES
• Refer to manufacturer's product inserts for GC-MS or LC-MS/MS
system used.
• Relevant forensic and clinical guidelines for 6-MAM analysis.
