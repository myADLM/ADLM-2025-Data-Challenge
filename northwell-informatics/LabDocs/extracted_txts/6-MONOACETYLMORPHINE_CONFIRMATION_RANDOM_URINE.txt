Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for 6-MONOACETYLMORPHINE
CONFIRMATION, RANDOM, URINE
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to detail the analytical process for the
detection and confirmation of 6-Monoacetylmorphine (6-MAM) in
random urine samples using liquid chromatography-tandem mass
spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing
the analysis and ensuring the integrity of test results.
• The lab supervisor is responsible for reviewing and approving
final results and ensuring compliance with this SOP.
1. SPECIMEN
Acceptable Specimen:
• 10 mL freshly voided and randomly collected urine.
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Urine sample received more than 72 hours after collection unless
preserved accordingly.
• Specimen without a proper label indicating collection date and
time.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• LC-MS/MS System
• Centrifuge
• Sample Preparation Equipment (e.g., pipettes, vortex mixer)
Reagents and Supplies:
• Calibrators and Controls
• Mobile Phases (e.g., methanol, water, acetonitrile, and buffer)
• Internal Standard for 6-MAM
• Sample Preparation Kits (e.g., solid-phase extraction cartridges)
• Lab-grade consumables (e.g., vials, pipette tips)
1. PROCEDURE
Sample Preparation:
1. Verify that the urine specimen is correctly labeled and within the
acceptable timeframe.
2. Aliquot an appropriate urine volume (typically 1-2 mL) into a
labeled sample vial.
3. Add the internal standard to each sample, calibrator, and
control vial.
4. Perform solid-phase extraction or another established sample
preparation method to isolate 6-MAM from the urine matrix.
5. Elute the analyte from extraction cartridges, dry the eluate, and
reconstitute it with a designated solvent for LC-MS/MS analysis.
LC-MS/MS Analysis:
1. Prepare the LC-MS/MS system according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
2. Load prepared samples, calibration standards, and quality
controls into the autosampler.
3. Set up the LC-MS/MS run using the established method for 6-
MAM detection.
4. Perform the chromatographic separation followed by tandem
mass spectrometry for analyte detection.
◦ Specific MRMs (multiple reaction monitoring transitions) for
6-MAM and the internal standard should be utilized.
Data Analysis:
1. Analyze chromatographic and spectral data to quantify 6-MAM
concentration in each specimen.
2. Ensure that calibration curves and quality control results meet
the acceptance criteria.
3. Re-assay any samples with results outside the calibration range
or with inconsistent quantitation.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run at least two levels of quality control (QC) samples (low and
high concentration) with each batch of specimens.
• Ensure that QC results are within the specified ranges before
proceeding with specimen reporting.
• Document all QC results and investigate any out-of-range results
before continuing with the analysis.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Enter final results into the laboratory information system (LIS)
after verifying data quality and integrity.
• Report results in ng/mL (nanograms per milliliter) with appropriate
comments if necessary (e.g., "6-MAM confirmed by LC-MS/MS").
• Follow site-specific reporting guidelines for transmitting results to
the appropriate healthcare providers.
