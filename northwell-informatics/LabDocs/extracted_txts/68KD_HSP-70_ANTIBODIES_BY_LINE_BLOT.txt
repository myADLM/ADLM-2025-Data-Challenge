Protocol for Analytical Phase of Generating Results for
68kD (HSP-70) Antibodies by Line Blot
1. PURPOSE
◦ To provide a standardized procedure for the detection of
68kD (HSP-70) antibodies by line blot technique, ensuring
accurate and reliable results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
◦ Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for
performing the test according to the outlined protocol and
documenting all required information.
◦ Laboratory technologists must ensure adherence to quality
control standards and appropriately report any deviations or
issues encountered during the analytical phase.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENT
◦ Serum is the preferred specimen.
◦ Collect blood in a red-top tube or serum separator tube
(SST). Allow blood to clot for 30 minutes and then centrifuge
the tube to separate the serum.
◦ Serum should be stored at 2-8°C if analyzed within 48 hours
or frozen at -20°C if there is a delay in analysis.
4. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
◦ 68kD (HSP-70) Antibodies Line Blot Kit (Contains blot strips,
wash buffer, detection reagents, and other necessary
components).
◦ Dilution buffer and blocking solution
◦ Incubation trays
◦ Pipettes and pipette tips
◦ Microcentrifuge tubes
◦ Wash bottles
◦ Orbital shaker
◦ Timer
5. PROCEDURE
◦ Preparation
1. Ensure all reagents and kit components are brought to
room temperature before starting the procedure.
2. Prepare wash buffer and blocking solution according
to manufacturer instructions.
3. Label the incubation trays with patient identifiers and
control names.
◦ Blot Incubation
1. Pipette the specified volume of serum (as indicated by
the kit insert) into microcentrifuge tubes.
2. Dilute the serum sample with dilution buffer as
recommended by the manufacturer.
3. Place the blot strips into the incubation trays.
4. Add the diluted serum samples and controls onto
designated blot strips.
5. Incubate the trays on an orbital shaker at room
temperature for the specified duration according to the
kit instructions.
◦ Washing
1. After incubation, wash the blot strips as
recommended.
2. Perform multiple washing steps using pre-prepared
wash buffer to ensure the removal of unbound
antibodies.
◦ Detection Reagent Incubation
1. Add the detection reagent (enzyme-conjugated
secondary antibody) to each blot strip.
2. Incubate on an orbital shaker at room temperature for
the specified duration.
◦ Final Washing and Detection
1. Wash the blot strips thoroughly after the incubation
period.
2. Develop the blot strips using the detection substrate
provided in the kit. Allow the reaction to proceed until
distinct bands appear.
◦ Evaluation
1. Stop the reaction by rinsing the blot strips with water
when optimal band development is achieved.
2. Allow blot strips to air dry.
6. INTERPRETATION AND RESULT RECORDING
◦ Compare the band intensity of patient samples to that of
positive and negative controls provided in the kit.
◦ Document the presence or absence of 68kD (HSP-70)
antibody bands and note their intensity relative to control
bands.
◦ Record the results in the laboratory information system (LIS)
following site-specific reporting guidelines.
◦ Confirm the findings with a second technologist if results are
ambiguous or unexpected.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Run positive and negative controls with each batch of tests
to ensure the reliability of results.
◦ Document all control results and take immediate corrective
action if controls fall outside predefined limits.
◦ Conduct regular proficiency testing as per laboratory's
quality management protocols.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ Report positive results as 68kD (HSP-70) antibodies
detected.
◦ Report negative results as 68kD (HSP-70) antibodies not
detected.
◦ Include additional interpretive comments or clinical
correlation statements as required.
9. REFERENCE INTERVAL
◦ Positive: Presence of bands corresponding to 68kD
(HSP-70) antibodies.
◦ Negative: Absence of specific bands corresponding to 68kD
(HSP-70) antibodies.
10. LIMITATIONS
• Hemolysis, lipemia, or microbial contamination of the specimen
may interfere with test results.
• Results should be interpreted in conjunction with clinical findings
and other diagnostic tests.
1. DOCUMENTATION
• Maintain detailed records of all test runs, including reagent lot
numbers, technician initials, and any anomalies encountered
during the testing process.
• Archive blot strips and documentation for a minimum period as
required by laboratory policy for quality control and audit
purposes.
