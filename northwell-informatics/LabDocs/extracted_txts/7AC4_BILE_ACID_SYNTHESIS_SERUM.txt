7AC4, BILE ACID SYNTHESIS, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
To outline the standard procedure for the analysis of serum samples
for bile acid synthesis using the respective instrument/assay kit,
ensuring accurate and timely results.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the
analysis and documenting results according to this procedure.
Supervisors are responsible for ensuring the procedure is followed
and for addressing any issues or deviations.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Serum
• Collection: Collect blood in a serum separator tube (SST or plain
red top).
• Volume: Minimum of 1 mL serum.
• Storage: Refrigerate serum at 2-8°C if not processed immediately.
Samples must be processed within 48 hours.
• Transport: Ensure specimens are transported to the laboratory in
a timely manner, maintaining proper temperature conditions.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Centrifuge
• Serum separator tubes (SST or red top)
• Analytical instrument specific for bile acid synthesis (e.g., LC-MS/
MS or other specified method)
• Reagents and consumables specific to the bile acid synthesis
assay kit
• Pipettes and tips
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
4. PROCEDURE
4.1. Specimen Preparation
• Allow serum separator tube to clot for at least 30 minutes.
• Centrifuge the sample at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes to separate
serum.
• Aliquot serum into appropriate labeled tubes for analysis.
4.2. Calibration and Quality Control
• Perform calibration of the instrument before running patient
samples according to manufacturer instructions.
• Run quality control samples (low, medium, and high controls) to
ensure instrument accuracy.
• Document results of calibration and quality control on the
respective logs.
4.3. Sample Analysis
4.3.1. Instrument Preparation
• Ensure the analytical instrument is properly prepared and ready to
use (e.g., filters, columns, etc.).
• Load the reagents and consumables onto the instrument as per
the manufacturer’s instructions.
4.3.2. Running the Samples
• Place the specimen samples in the designated sample holder.
• Ensure correct positioning and secure samples to avoid spillage.
• Start the analysis following the instrument’s protocol.
• Monitor the instrument during analysis to ensure proper
functioning.
4.4. Result Review and Documentation
• Once analysis is complete, review the results generated by the
instrument.
• Confirm results using quality control data.
• Document results on the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Verify and sign off the results according to laboratory policy.
5. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results are automatically transmitted to the LIS.
• Review and verify results in LIS before final reporting.
• Notify the clinician if any critical values or unexpected results are
observed.
• Follow site-specific guidelines for reporting results.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform daily, weekly, and monthly quality control checks.
• Use certified reference materials and maintain quality logs to track
the performance of the assay.
• If quality control results fall outside the acceptable range:
◦ Recalibrate the instrument.
◦ Re-run quality control samples.
◦ Investigate and address the source of error before running
patient samples.
7. REFERENCE RANGES AND INTERPRETATION
Consult latest literature or manufacturer's insert for specific reference
ranges relevant to the bile acid synthesis assay.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the assay kit or instrument insert for specific procedural
limitations and interferences.
9. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's assay kit insert (latest version)
• Instrument operation manual
• Relevant clinical guidelines and publications on bile acid
synthesis.
10. SAFETY AND PPE
• Always wear PPE when handling patient samples and reagents.
• Follow safety guidelines for working with biohazardous materials.
• Dispose of waste according to the laboratory's biohazard disposal
policy.
This protocol ensures the standardized analytical processing of
7AC4, Bile Acid Synthesis assay, promoting accurate and consistent
results essential for clinical assessment.
