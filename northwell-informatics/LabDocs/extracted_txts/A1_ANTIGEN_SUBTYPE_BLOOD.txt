Protocol for A1 Antigen Subtype, Blood Analysis
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this protocol is to outline the procedures for
identification of A1 antigen subtype in blood samples. This involves
necessary steps from initial sample processing to the final reporting
of results.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Acceptable Specimen Types:
• Whole blood sample collected in EDTA or ACD anticoagulant-
containing tubes.
Unacceptable Specimen Types:
• Specimens received in serum tubes or non-EDTA/non-ACD tubes.
• Specimens received clotted or with compromised integrity.
• Specimens not properly labelled with patient details and collection
date/time.
Specimen Handling:
• Samples must be stored at 2-8°C and processed within 24 hours
of collection.
• Specimens must be adequately mixed and checked for integrity
before analysis.
3. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
Equipment:
• Centrifuge
• Blood grouping analyzer (e.g., Ortho VISION™)
• Pipettes and tips
• Refrigerated storage units for reagents and samples
Reagents:
• Monoclonal Anti-A1 (Murine-derived)
• Blood grouping reagents and controls
• PBS buffer solution
• QC reagents for daily validation
4. PROCEDURE
Initial Sample Processing:
1. Verify sample integrity and proper labeling.
2. Centrifuge the whole blood sample at 2000 rpm for 10 minutes
to separate plasma and red cells.
3. Discard the plasma and wash the red cells with PBS buffer
solution twice.
4. Prepare a 3-5% red cell suspension for testing.
A1 Antigen Testing:
1. Set up the blood grouping analyzer and perform daily QC
checks.
2. Load the prepared red cell suspension into the analyzer or
manually pipette onto the reaction tray if manual testing is
preferred.
3. Add monoclonal Anti-A1 reagent to the sample.
4. Allow for incubation as specified in reagent instructions
(typically 15 minutes at room temperature).
5. Observe the reactions for agglutination:
◦ Positive Agglutination: Presence of A1 antigen subtype.
◦ No Agglutination: Absence of A1 antigen subtype or
presence of A2 subtype.
Quality Control:
1. Perform QC with both positive and negative controls - A1
positive and A2 negative cell suspensions.
2. Document QC results and ensure they fall within acceptable
ranges provided by the reagent manufacturer.
5. REPORTING RESULTS
Reference Intervals:
• Positive Agglutination: A1 antigen present
• No Agglutination: Absence of A1 antigen subtype (potentially A2)
Procedure for Reporting:
1. Document results in the laboratory information system (LIS).
2. Ensure accuracy of patient information and test results.
3. Review results for any discrepancies and confirm with repeat
testing if necessary.
4. Release results to the physician with appropriate
interpretations.
6. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Specimen integrity: Hemolyzed or improperly collected samples
can yield inaccurate results.
• Antigen variability: Rare subtypes within the A group may not be
detected with standard reagents.
7. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s package insert for monoclonal Anti-A1 reagent.
• Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines for blood
antigen typing.
8. ADDITIONAL NOTES
• Ensure proper training is conducted for laboratory personnel.
• Maintain updated documentation on reagent and equipment
calibration and maintenance.
• Adhere to standard operating procedures to ensure consistent
and reproducible results.
