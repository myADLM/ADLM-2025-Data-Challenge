1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to outline the steps required to
perform the analytical phase of generating results for abnormal prion
protein detection in spinal fluid using the Real-Time Quaking Induced
Conversion (RT-QuIC) assay. This protocol is intended for use by
trained laboratory personnel in a CLIA-certified laboratory.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of designated laboratory staff to perform and
document all steps of the RT-QuIC assay, including quality control
and reporting of results. Laboratory supervisors are responsible for
ensuring that the assay is performed according to this SOP and for
addressing any issues that may arise.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Acceptable Specimens:
◦ Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) collected via lumbar puncture.
• Unacceptable Specimens:
◦ Specimens that are not CSF.
◦ Specimens that are not collected in sterile, leak-proof
containers.
◦ Specimens that have been improperly labeled, transported, or
stored.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Real-Time Quaking Induced Conversion (RT-QuIC) instrument.
• Centrifuge suitable for microcentrifuge tubes.
• Vortex mixer.
• Pipettes and sterile, filtered pipette tips.
• Plate reader for detecting amyloid formation.
Reagents:
• Prion protein substrate.
• Amyloid dye (e.g., Thioflavin T).
• Tris-buffered saline (TBS).
• Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS).
• Other chemicals and reagents as per the RT-QuIC kit instructions.
Supplies:
• Sterile, DNase/RNase-free microcentrifuge tubes.
• Optical 96-well plate.
• Laboratory gloves and proper personal protective equipment
(PPE).
5. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation
1. Confirm that the CSF sample has been properly collected and
labeled.
2. Centrifuge the CSF sample at 3000 rpm for 5 minutes to
remove any particulate matter.
3. Aliquot the required volume of supernatant (typically 100-200
μL) into a sterile, labeled microcentrifuge tube.
B. Reagent Preparation
1. Prepare the prion protein substrate solution according to the
provided instructions.
2. Prepare the amyloid dye (e.g., Thioflavin T) freshly before use.
3. Prepare the reaction buffer (e.g., TBS) and other necessary
reagents as directed by the kit instructions.
C. RT-QuIC Reaction Setup
1. Label the optical 96-well plate with sample IDs and controls
(positive and negative controls must be included).
2. Add the prepared reaction buffer to each well.
3. Add the prion protein substrate solution to each well.
4. Add the amyloid dye to each well.
5. Add the appropriate volume of prepared CSF sample or control
to each well.
D. Running the RT-QuIC Assay
1. Secure the optical 96-well plate in the RT-QuIC instrument.
2. Follow the instrument’s software instructions to configure the
assay parameters, including incubation time, temperature, and
reading intervals.
3. Start the RT-QuIC assay and monitor the instrument during the
run.
E. Data Acquisition and Analysis
1. Upon completion of the assay, collect the fluorescence data
from the instrument.
2. Analyze the fluorescence data to determine the presence or
absence of abnormal prion protein.
3. Use the provided software or follow manual instructions for data
interpretation and quality control assessment.
4. Repeat any assay with inconclusive or questionable results.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Run positive and negative controls with each batch of samples
to validate the assay’s performance.
2. Document all control results and ensure they fall within the
acceptable range before reporting patient results.
3. Perform regular maintenance and calibration of the RT-QuIC
instrument as recommended by the manufacturer.
4. Participate in proficiency testing programs to ensure continued
accuracy and reliability of the assay.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Report the results to the attending physician or medical
provider as per laboratory protocols.
2. Document the findings in the laboratory information system
(LIS) for record-keeping and further action.
3. Notify the supervisor immediately if any critical or unexpected
results are encountered.
8. LIMITATIONS
• Refer to the RT-QuIC kit instructions for any specific limitations
related to reagent stability, specimen handling, or assay
performance.
• Awareness of potential interfering substances in CSF samples
that may affect the assay outcome.
