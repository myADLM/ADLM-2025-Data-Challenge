SOP: Analytical Phase for ABO/RH Blood Typing
1. PURPOSE
To provide standard procedures for the determination of blood groups
and Rh (D) types for transfusion compatibility purposes.
Responsibility:
Laboratory technologists are responsible for performing,
documenting, and verifying the ABO/Rh blood typing procedures
according to the guidelines set forth in this SOP.
2. SPECIMEN
Preferred Specimen:
• Freshly collected whole blood in EDTA or blood group collection
tubes.
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Hemolyzed samples.
• Samples with inadequate volume.
• Samples with incorrect or missing labels.
3. MATERIALS AND REAGENTS
• Anti-A, Anti-B, Anti-D monoclonal reagents.
• A1 cells, B cells, and O cells for reverse typing.
• Glass slides or wells.
• Micropipettes and tips.
• Saline solution.
• Control reagents (Positive and negative).
• Centrifuge.
• Test tubes.
4. PROCEDURE
Forward Typing (Direct Antigen Test):
1. Label three test tubes as A, B, and D.
2. Add one drop of Anti-A, Anti-B, and Anti-D serum to respective
labeled tubes.
3. Add one drop of patient’s blood sample to each tube.
4. Mix the contents gently and incubate at room temperature for
15-30 seconds.
5. Centrifuge the tubes at 1000 rpm for 1 minute.
6. Examine for agglutination in each tube.
◦ If agglutination occurs in the Anti-A tube only, the blood type
is A.
◦ If agglutination occurs in the Anti-B tube only, the blood type
is B.
◦ If agglutination occurs in both tubes, the blood type is AB.
◦ If no agglutination occurs in either tube, the blood type is O.
◦ If agglutination occurs in the Anti-D tube, the Rh type is
positive.
◦ If no agglutination occurs, the Rh type is negative.
Reverse Typing (Indirect Antibody Test):
1. Label two test tubes as A1 and B.
2. Add one drop of A1 cells and B cells respectively to the labeled
tubes.
3. Add one drop of patient’s plasma to each tube.
4. Mix the contents gently and incubate at room temperature for
15-30 seconds.
5. Centrifuge the tubes at 1000 rpm for 1 minute.
6. Examine for agglutination in each tube.
◦ If agglutination occurs with A1 cells only, the blood type is B.
◦ If agglutination occurs with B cells only, the blood type is A.
◦ If agglutination occurs in both A1 and B cells, the blood type
is O.
◦ If no agglutination occurs in either tube, the blood type is
AB.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform quality control checks daily using known positive and
negative controls.
• Document all results including controls and patient samples.
• Ensure monoclonal reagents are within expiry and stored
according to manufacturer guidelines.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
• Verify agglutination results and ensure consistency between
forward and reverse typing.
• Review and validate results.
• Enter results into LIS (Laboratory Information System) and report
findings.
Reference Intervals:
• Validations and acceptability criteria for the test are based on
established norms and manufacturer guidelines.
Method Limitations:
• Hemolyzed samples may lead to incorrect results.
• Inadequate mixing may cause false negatives.
• Contaminated reagents can interfere with the test results.
7. APPENDIX
Reference Materials:
• Manufacturer instructions for Anti-A, Anti-B, and Anti-D reagents.
• Quality control guidelines.
• SOP for sample collection, handling, and storage.

This protocol provides a comprehensive and methodical approach for
the analytical phase of generating results for ABO/Rh blood typing to
ensure accuracy and reliability in the testing process. All laboratory
technologists must strictly adhere to these procedures and
guidelines.
