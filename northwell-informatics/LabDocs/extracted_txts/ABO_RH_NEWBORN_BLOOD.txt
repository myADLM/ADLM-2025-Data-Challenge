Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase of Generating Results for ABO/RH Newborn
Blood Test
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for performing ABO and Rh
blood typing for newborns, ensuring accurate and reliable blood type
results to be utilized for clinical decision making.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing blood
typing on newborn samples using this SOP. It is the responsibility of
all staff to ensure that procedures are followed, and any irregularities
are promptly reported to a supervisor.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
a. Preferred Specimen Type: - Cord blood or capillary blood collected
in an EDTA (lavender top) microtainer.
b. Specimen Handling: - Specimens must be collected and properly
labeled with patient identification details including name, unique ID
number, collection date and time. - Ensure specimens are mixed
thoroughly before testing, by gentle inversion.
Unacceptable Specimens: - Clotted samples. - Hemolyzed samples. -
Specimens with insufficient blood volume (< 0.5 mL).
Specimen Stability: - Store at 2-8°C if testing is not performed
immediately. Specimens should be tested within 48 hours of
collection.
1. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
a. Equipment: - Centrifuge - Blood typing card reading device (if
available) - Incubator (if applicable)
b. Supplies: - Anti-A, Anti-B, and Anti-D (Anti-Rh) antisera - Typing
cards or gel cards - Pipettes - Test tubes and rack - Gloves and PPE
- Sterile lancets (if needed for capillary blood collection) - Absorbent
wipes
1. PROCEDURE
a. Preparation: - Verify patient identification and specimen labeling. -
Wear appropriate PPE. - Bring the specimen to room temperature
before starting the test if previously refrigerated.
b. Forward Typing (ABO): - Label three tubes for newborn: Anti-A,
Anti-B, and Control. - Add one drop of Anti-A, Anti-B antisera in the
respective labeled tubes. - Add one drop of newborn blood. - Mix
gently and centrifuge for 15 seconds at 3400 rpm. - Gently re-
suspend the red cell button, and observe for agglutination. - Record
results immediately: - Agglutination indicates the presence of the
corresponding antigen.
c. Anti-D Typing (Rh): - Label one tube as Anti-D. - Add one drop of
Anti-D antisera to the tube. - Add one drop of newborn blood. - Mix
gently and centrifuge for 15 seconds at 3400 rpm. - Gently re-
suspend the red cell button, and observe for agglutination. - Record
results immediately: - Agglutination indicates Rh positive. - No
agglutination indicates Rh negative.
d. Confirmatory Testing (if needed): - For any discrepancies or
inconclusive results, perform repeat testing. - If using gel cards,
follow the manufacturer's insert for proper incubation and reading.
1. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
• Forward Typing:
◦ Agglutination in Anti-A tube = A antigen present (A blood type).
◦ Agglutination in Anti-B tube = B antigen present (B blood type).
◦ Agglutination in both tubes = AB blood type.
◦ No agglutination = O blood type.
• Rh Typing:
◦ Agglutination in Anti-D tube = Rh Positive.
◦ No agglutination in Anti-D tube = Rh Negative.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run positive and negative controls with each batch of tests.
• Document control results and ensure they fall within acceptable
ranges.
• If controls fail, do not proceed with patient testing until issues are
resolved and controls pass.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Verify test results against control.
• Notify the relevant clinical personnel of any critical or unusual
findings.
1. LIMITATIONS
• Hemolyzed or clotted samples can lead to inaccurate results.
• Mixed field reactions may require additional testing.

This SOP must be reviewed and approved by laboratory
management and quality assurance team before implementation and
should be updated regularly to ensure compliance with current
standards and guidelines.
