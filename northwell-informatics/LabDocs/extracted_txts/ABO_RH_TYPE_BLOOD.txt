Standard Operating Procedure
(SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase of Generating
Results for ABO/Rh Blood Typing
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the procedure for the analytical phase of
generating results for ABO/Rh blood typing. This ensures accurate
and consistent results in determining an individual's blood group and
Rh factor, which is critical for transfusions, organ transplantation, and
prenatal testing.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all staff members in the laboratory who are
responsible for performing and verifying ABO/Rh blood typing.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of trained laboratory personnel to perform the
ABO/Rh blood typing and ensure accurate results. Supervisors must
ensure compliance with this SOP and manage any non-
conformances.
4. DEFINITIONS
• ABO Blood Group System: A classification system for human
blood based on the presence or absence of A and B antigens on
red blood cells.
• Rh Factor: A protein that can be present on the surface of red
blood cells; individuals are classified as Rh-positive if they have
the protein and Rh-negative if they do not.
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred Specimen: EDTA anticoagulated whole blood.
• Specimen Stability: Specimens should be tested within 72 hours
of collection to ensure accuracy.
6. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Blood typing serums (Anti-A, Anti-B, Anti-D)
• Reagent red cells (A1, B, and O cells)
• Test tubes or microplate wells
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes
• Saline solution
• Microscope or visual observation instrument
7. PROCEDURE
A. Forward Grouping (Antigen Detection)
1. Label Test Tubes/Microplate Wells: Clearly label test tubes or
wells for Anti-A, Anti-B, and Anti-D.
2. Add Reagents:
◦ Add 1 drop of Anti-A serum to the corresponding test tube/
well.
◦ Add 1 drop of Anti-B serum to the corresponding test tube/
well.
◦ Add 1 drop of Anti-D serum to the corresponding test tube/
well.
3. Add Patient Sample:
◦ Add 1 drop of the patient's blood to each of the tubes/wells.
4. Mix and Incubate:
◦ Mix the contents gently and incubate for 15-30 seconds (or
according to the manufacturer’s instructions) at room
temperature.
5. Centrifuge:
◦ Centrifuge the test tubes at 1000 rpm for 15 seconds.
6. Interpret Results:
◦ Observe for agglutination under a microscope or visual
observation instrument.
◦ Record the presence or absence of agglutination for each
reagent. Agglutination indicates a positive reaction.
B. Reverse Grouping (Antibody Detection)
1. Label Test Tubes/Microplate Wells: Clearly label test tubes or
wells for A1, B, and O cells.
2. Add Reagent Red Cells:
◦ Add 1 drop of A1 cells to the corresponding test tube/well.
◦ Add 1 drop of B cells to the corresponding test tube/well.
◦ Add 1 drop of O cells to the corresponding test tube/well.
3. Add Patient Plasma:
◦ Add 2 drops of the patient's plasma to each tube/well.
4. Mix and Incubate:
◦ Mix the contents gently and incubate for 15-30 seconds (or
according to the manufacturer’s instructions) at room
temperature.
5. Centrifuge:
◦ Centrifuge the test tubes at 1000 rpm for 15 seconds.
6. Interpret Results:
◦ Observe for agglutination under a microscope or visual
observation instrument.
◦ Record the presence or absence of agglutination for each
reagent red cell. Agglutination indicates a positive reaction.
8. RESULT INTERPRETATION
• Cross-check the results from the forward and reverse grouping to
determine the patient's ABO/Rh type.
• Forward Grouping:
◦ Anti-A: Agglutination indicates A antigen.
◦ Anti-B: Agglutination indicates B antigen.
◦ Anti-D: Agglutination indicates Rh-positive.
• Reverse Grouping:
◦ A1 cells: Agglutination indicates anti-A antibodies.
◦ B cells: Agglutination indicates anti-B antibodies.
◦ O cells: No agglutination expected, used as control.
• Compare both tests to confirm blood type.
9. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform quality control with known positive and negative controls
for each batch of tests.
• Document QC results in the QC log.
• Investigate any discrepancies before reporting patient results.
10. REPORTING RESULTS
• Document results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Review and verify results by a second technologist if required.
• Communicate any critical findings to the appropriate clinical staff
immediately.
11. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• False positive/negative reactions can occur due to technical
errors or rare antigenic variability. Repeat testing if necessary.
• In case of discrepancies, perform additional confirmatory tests.

• Manufacturer's instructions for use of typing serums and reagent
red cells.

This protocol must be adhered to by all laboratory personnel to
ensure reliable and accurate results for ABO/Rh blood typing.
