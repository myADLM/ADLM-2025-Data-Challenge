Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for ABO Titer Testing
1. PURPOSE
This SOP provides a structured approach to the quantitative
determination of ABO antibodies in serum or plasma. It is intended to
standardize procedures and ensure the reliability and accuracy of
results. The ABO titer test measures the concentration of antibodies
against ABO blood group antigens, which is valuable in various
clinical contexts including transfusion medicine, organ
transplantation, and hematology.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing the
ABO titer test as outlined in this SOP. It is the responsibility of all staff
to inform the supervisor of any deviations or issues encountered
during the procedure.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/acceptable:
• Serum or plasma extracted from whole blood collected in a serum
separator tube (SST) or an EDTA tube. Specimens must be
properly labeled with the patient's identification and collection
time.
• Minimum volume of 5 mL.
• Specimens must be centrifuged and serum or plasma separated
within 2 hours of collection.
Unacceptable:
• Specimens collected in tubes containing anticoagulants other
than EDTA.
• Hemolyzed, clotted, or visibly contaminated specimens.
• Specimens stored at inappropriate temperatures or beyond the
recommended stability period.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Centrifuge
• Serological pipettes and tips
• Test tubes or microtiter plates
• Dilution buffer (e.g., phosphate-buffered saline, PBS)
• ABO typing reagents (including anti-A and anti-B antisera)
• Microscope or automated cell counter
• Incubator set to 37°C
• Documentation log
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation Steps:
• Verify specimen identity and acceptability.
• Label a sufficient number of test tubes or wells for serial dilutions.
• Prepare the dilution series using the serum or plasma sample and
PBS for accuracy.
B. Serial Dilution:
• Create a series of doubling dilutions in PBS starting with 1:2
through to 1:512 or higher, depending on laboratory practices and
clinical requirements.
• Add 50 µL of serum or plasma to the first test tube labeled 1:2.
• Add 50 µL of PBS to each of the remaining tubes.
• Perform serial dilutions by transferring 50 µL from the first tube to
the next, mixing thoroughly, and continuing this process through
the entire series.
C. Antibody Titration:
• Add an equal volume (usually 50 µL) of a 2-5% suspension of
reagent red cells (group A and group B cells) to each dilution tube
or plate well.
• Incubate the mixture at 37°C for 30 minutes.
• Centrifuge the tubes at 1000 rpm for 1 minute or according to the
laboratory's validation.
• Carefully resuspend the cell button and observe for agglutination.
D. Reading and Interpretation:
• Examine each tube or well under a microscope or using an
automated cell counter for agglutination.
• Record the highest dilution that shows 1+ agglutination as the
titer.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
Material:
• Positive and negative control sera: use known positive sera with a
significant titer and negative control sera without any detectable
antibodies.
• Perform a parallel titration with the control sera alongside the
patient samples.
Frequency:
• Run controls with each new batch of reagents or at the start of
each test run.
• Document control results on the quality control log.
Acceptance Criteria:
• The positive control should show agglutination at the expected
dilution.
• The negative control should show no agglutination.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Calculate the ABO antibody titer and record the results in the
Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Refer to site-specific guidelines for result interpretation and
reporting.
• If critical titer thresholds are breached, inform the physician or
clinical team directly and promptly.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• False positives or negatives can occur if reagents are not used
properly or if samples are not handled and stored appropriately.
• Heterogeneity in patient antibodies can lead to variable results.
• Other factors such as recent transfusions, medications, or
underlying diseases may affect titers.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Establish specific reference intervals for the patient population
served by the laboratory according to clinical guidelines and
validated thresholds.
• Generally, for transfusion compatibility, a titer less than or equal to
1:8 is acceptable, but clinical relevance should always be
reviewed on a case-by-case basis.
