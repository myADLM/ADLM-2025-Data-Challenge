1. Purpose: The purpose of this Standard Operating Procedure
(SOP) is to outline the protocol for generating results for the
assessment of Allergic Bronchopulmonary Aspergillosis (ABPA)
through the ABPA Cascade. The methodology, steps, and
quality control procedures necessary to ensure accurate and
reliable results are described.
2. Specimen: Preferred/acceptable:
• Serum or plasma (EDTA, heparin, or SST tube)
• Volume: Minimum 1 mL
Unacceptable:
• Specimens with hemolysis, lipemia, or icterus
• Specimens in anticoagulants other than specified (e.g., sodium
citrate)
• Specimens received at an inappropriate temperature or after the
stability period without proper pre-processing
1. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies:
• Immunoassay analyzer
• ELISA kits for Aspergillus-specific IgE and IgG, total IgE
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Calibration and control materials
• Quality control serums
• Timer
1. Procedure:
A) Initial Specimen Processing:
• Centrifuge blood specimens at 1500 x g for 10 minutes to
separate serum/plasma.
• Transfer serum/plasma to appropriately labeled aliquot tubes.
• Store specimens at 2-8°C if testing is not to be performed
immediately.
B) Immunoassay Setup and Calibration:
• Refer to the instrument manual for calibration and daily quality
control procedures.
• Load the assay calibrators, controls, and patient samples onto the
analyzer following manufacturer instructions.
C) Testing for ABPA Cascade:
1. Aspergillus-specific IgE and IgG: - Perform the qualitative and/
or quantitative measurement of Aspergillus-specific IgE and IgG
using ELISA kits according to the packaged insert. - Incubate
and wash as specified in the ELISA kit instructions. - Read
absorbance at the specified wavelength on the microplate
reader.
2. Total IgE: - Follow the outlined procedure on the immunoassay
analyzer using the total IgE reagent kit. - Incubate, wash, and
read absorbance based on the kit’s guidelines.
D) Result Interpretation and Reporting:
• Compare the results for Aspergillus-specific IgE and IgG against
the kit-provided reference ranges.
• Interpret total IgE levels considering clinical context and specific
allergen results.
Reference Intervals:
• Aspergillus-specific IgE: negative for non-sensitized individual;
ranges from mildly positive to highly positive levels as indicated in
kit-specific reference
• Aspergillus-specific IgG: to be compared with ranges provided in
assay instructions
• Total IgE: Normal range varies, typically 1-100 IU/mL
E) Quality Control:
• Run controls and calibrators in conjunction with patient samples.
• Document and verify QC results to ensure all are within
acceptable ranges before reporting patient results.
• Repeat any assay where control results indicate a failure.
F) Corrective Actions for Out-of-Range Results:
• Reassess sample handling and preparation.
• Re-calibrate immunoassay analyzer and re-run QC.
• If repeated QC fails, alert the supervisor and discontinue testing
with the problematic batch until resolution.
1. Reporting Results:
• Results are reviewed and verified by the technologist.
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information Systems (LIS) for
review by the physician.
1. Method Limitations:
• Refer to the package insert of each assay for specific limitations
regarding cross-reactivity, interference, and sensitivity.
1. References:
• ELISA kit inserts for Aspergillus-specific IgE, IgG, and total IgE
• Instrument manuals
• Relevant clinical guidelines for ABPA diagnosis
This protocol ensures that proper procedures for the analysis of
ABPA are followed, leading to accurate and reliable patient results.
