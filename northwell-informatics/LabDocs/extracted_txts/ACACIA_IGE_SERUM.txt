Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase:
ACACIA and IGE (Serum)
1. PURPOSE
To ensure the accurate and reliable analysis of serum samples for
ACACIA and IGE (serum), following standardized procedures for
testing, monitoring, documentation, and quality control.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to the analysis of serum ACACIA (alpha
chain) and IgE (immunoglobulin E) in the clinical laboratory. It is
assumed the specimen has already been collected, received, and
accessioned.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Laboratory technologists are responsible for performing the tests
in accordance with this SOP.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring adherence to the SOP,
troubleshooting issues, and ensuring proper documentation.
• QC managers oversee the quality control of all tests.
4. REAGENTS AND EQUIPMENT
• ELISA kits or automated analyzers specifically designed for
ACACIA and IgE (serum) testing
• Micropipettes and tips
• Reagent reservoirs
• Calibrators and controls (high, medium, and low)
• 96-well microplates
• Incubator set at 37°C
• Plate washer
• Plate reader/spectrophotometer
• Computer with data analysis software
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
• Preferred Sample: Serum
• Collection Tubes: SST (Serum Separator Tubes). Must be
centrifuged and serum aliquoted within 2 hours of collection.
• Storage: Serum samples should be stored at 2-8°C and analyzed
within 7 days. For longer storage, samples can be frozen at -20°C
or lower.
• Unacceptable Samples: Hemolyzed, lipemic, or highly icteric
samples.
6. PROCEDURE
6.1 Sample Preparation
• Allow serum samples and reagents to reach room temperature
(18-25°C) before starting the assay.
• Mix samples gently by inverting, avoiding any frothing.
6.2 Calibration and Quality Control
• Prepare calibrators and control solutions according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
• Run controls and calibrators at the beginning and end of each
assay to verify the accuracy and precision of the results.
• Control results must fall within the specified range before patient
results can be reported.
6.3 Testing Procedure A. ACACIA (Alpha Chain)
1. Prepare the ELISA kit reagents as per the manufacturer's
instructions.
2. Dispense 100μL of standards, controls, and test samples into
respective wells of the microplate.
3. Add diluted enzyme conjugate to each well.
4. Incubate the plate at 37°C for 60 minutes.
5. Wash the plate thoroughly with the plate washer.
6. Add substrate solution to each well and incubate in the dark at
room temperature for 10-15 minutes.
7. Add stop solution. The color will change from blue to yellow.
8. Read the optical density at 450 nm using the plate reader within
30 minutes.
B. IgE (Serum)
1. Prepare the ELISA kit reagents according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
2. Dispense 50μL of standards, controls, and test samples into
designated wells of the microplate.
3. Add enzyme conjugate and mix well.
4. Incubate the plate at 37°C for 60 minutes.
5. Wash the plate gently using the plate washer.
6. Add substrate solution to each well and incubate in the dark at
room temperature for 10 minutes.
7. Stop the reaction and read the results at 450 nm with the plate
reader within 30 minutes.
6.4 Data Analysis and Calculations
• Calculate the concentration of ACACIA and IgE in the samples
using the calibration curve obtained by plotting the optical density
(OD) readings of the standards.
• Ensure all calculations are verified and cross-checked by another
technologist or automated software.
7. QUALITY CONTROL AND DOCUMENTATION
• Quality Control:
◦ Ensure control results fall within the permissible range. If
controls fail, the test run must be invalidated, and
troubleshooting procedures followed.
◦ Document any corrective action taken.
• Reporting Results:
◦ Results are reviewed and validated by the technologist before
reporting.
◦ Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS) and
verify for accuracy.
• Retain records of each test run, including calibration curves,
control results, and patient results, in accordance with laboratory
policies and regulatory requirements.
8. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If optical density values are outside expected ranges or if curves
are abnormal, review sample handling procedures, reagent
preparation, and equipment calibration.
• Consult manufacturer's guidelines for specific troubleshooting tips
regarding unusual patterns or anomalies in the test.

updates or changes in regulations and laboratory practices.
• Document any changes in the revision history table for
traceability.
