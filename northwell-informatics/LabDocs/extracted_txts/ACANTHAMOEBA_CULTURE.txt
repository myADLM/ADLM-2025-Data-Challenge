ACANTHAMOEBA CULTURE SOP
1. PURPOSE
To outline the standard operating procedure for the analytical phase
of generating results for Acanthamoeba culture, ensuring accurate,
reliable, and timely results for patient care and diagnosis.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory personnel to
perform Acanthamoeba culture testing as per the outlined procedure.
All staff must report any deficiencies or issues encountered during
the process to the appointed supervisor immediately.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENT
• Preferred specimens: Corneal scrapings, contact lens solution,
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), tissue biopsy, or other body fluids as
indicated.
• Unacceptable specimens: Specimens that are improperly
labeled, contaminated, or not collected and transported as per the
laboratory guidelines.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Modified non-nutrient agar plates (NNA) seeded with Escherichia
coli (E. coli)
• Sterile inoculation loop or needle
• Incubator set at 30°C
• Sterile saline or Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)
• Sterile pipettes
• Microscope with phase-contrast capability
• Slides and coverslips
• Gloves and personal protective equipment (PPE)
1. PROCEDURE
A. Inoculation of Specimen:
1. Specimen Preparation:
◦ For solid specimens like tissue biopsies, homogenize a
small piece in sterile saline or PBS.
◦ For fluid specimens, use directly or centrifuge if large
volume, and resuspend the pellet in a small volume of
sterile saline or PBS.
2. Inoculation:
◦ Using a sterile inoculation loop or pipette, transfer a small
aliquot of the prepared specimen to the center of the NNA
plate seeded with E. coli.
◦ Distribute the inoculum evenly across the agar surface using
a zigzag streaking technique.
3. Incubation:
◦ Place the inoculated agar plate in the incubator at 30°C.
◦ Incubate for up to 14 days, checking the plates daily for
growth.
B. Examination for Growth:
1. Daily Monitoring:
◦ Examine the plates daily using a phase-contrast microscope
at 100x magnification for any signs of Acanthamoeba
growth.
◦ Look for characteristic double-walled cysts and trophozoite
forms.
2. Positive Identification:
◦ If Acanthamoeba is suspected, take a sample from
suspected growth on the plate and examine under a
coverslip.
◦ Confirm the presence of cysts (rounded with double walls)
and trophozoites.
3. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include known positive controls (known cultures of
Acanthamoeba) and negative controls with each batch of cultures
to ensure the accuracy of results.
• Document any and all observations of contamination,
discrepancies, or unusual growth patterns.
• Record results daily and initiate corrective actions if controls do
not perform as expected.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Positive Culture:
◦ Report as “Acanthamoeba isolated” along with a description of
the observed forms (cysts or trophozoites).
• Negative Culture:
◦ If no Acanthamoeba growth is observed after 14 days, report
as “No Acanthamoeba isolated.”
• Inconclusive Results:
◦ If there is any doubt in identification, repeat the assay or
confirm using molecular techniques if available.

1. REVIEW AND COMMON COMPLIANCE
• This SOP must be reviewed annually or when protocols are
updated.
• Ensure compliance with all relevant regulations, including CLIA,
CAP, and local health regulations.
