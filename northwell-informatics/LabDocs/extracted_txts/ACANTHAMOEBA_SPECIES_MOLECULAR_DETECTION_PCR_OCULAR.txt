Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Acanthamoeba Species
Molecular Detection, PCR, Ocular
1. Purpose
The purpose of this Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is to detail
the procedure for the detection of Acanthamoeba species DNA in
ocular samples using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methodology.
This protocol ensures accurate identification and reporting of
Acanthamoeba species to assist in the diagnosis of ocular infections.
1. Responsibility
All personnel conducting the Acanthamoeba PCR test must be
trained and proficient in molecular diagnostic techniques. It is the
responsibility of the laboratory supervisor to ensure that all personnel
are trained, that the equipment is maintained, and that quality control
is routinely performed and documented.
1. Specimen Requirements
Acceptable Specimens:
• Corneal scrapings
• Contact lenses and lens cases
• Ocular swab
Specimen Handling:
• Samples should be collected and transported in sterile containers.
• Samples must be stored at 2-8°C if processing is delayed (not to
exceed 24 hours).
• Prior to testing, samples should be brought to room temperature.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens not properly labeled or without a requisition form.
• Specimens with gross contamination.
1. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies
• DNA extraction kit (e.g., Qiagen DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit)
• Thermal cycler (PCR machine)
• PCR reagents including Master Mix
• Primers and probes specific for Acanthamoeba species
• Nuclease-free water
• Positive control DNA (Acanthamoeba species)
• Negative control (Nuclease-free water)
• Agarose gel electrophoresis equipment (if performing gel-based
confirmation)
• UV transilluminator or gel documentation system (if performing
gel-based confirmation)
• Real-Time PCR machine (if performing Real-Time PCR detection)
• Laboratory pipettes and barrier tips
• Sterile microcentrifuge tubes
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
• Laboratory documentation materials (logbooks, result forms)
1. Procedure
A. DNA Extraction:
1. Use the DNA extraction kit following the manufacturer’s
protocol.
2. For corneal scrapings and swabs, use the entire sample.
3. For contact lenses and lens cases, immerse the sample in a
small volume of extraction buffer.
4. Elute the DNA into a final volume of 50-100µL as per the kit's
protocol.
5. Store extracted DNA at -20°C until ready for PCR analysis.
B. PCR Setup:
1. Prepare the PCR Master Mix according to the reagent
manufacturer’s instructions, including primers and probes
specific for Acanthamoeba species.
2. Aliquot the Master Mix into PCR tubes or a PCR plate.
3. Add 5µL of extracted DNA sample to each tube/well. Include
positive and negative control samples in each run.
4. Cap the tubes or seal the plate and briefly centrifuge to ensure
all components are at the bottom.
C. PCR Amplification:
1. Load the PCR tubes/plate into the thermal cycler.
2. Set the thermal cycler according to the following cycling
conditions (example): a. Initial denaturation: 95°C for 5 minutes
b. Denaturation: 95°C for 30 seconds c. Annealing: 55°C for 30
seconds d. Extension: 72°C for 30 seconds e. Final extension:
72°C for 5 minutes f. Number of cycles: 35-40
D. Post-PCR Analysis:
1. For conventional PCR, load the PCR products onto an agarose
gel and perform electrophoresis.
2. Visualize the gel under UV light. Compare the sample bands to
the positive control to confirm the presence of Acanthamoeba
species DNA.
3. For Real-Time PCR, analyze the amplification curves to
determine the presence of target DNA and calculate Ct values.
4. Quality Control
• Include positive (known Acanthamoeba species DNA) and
negative (nuclease-free water) controls in each PCR run to
ensure the accuracy and reliability of the test.
• Document all control results and ensure they meet the
acceptance criteria before reporting patient results.
• Run periodic proficiency tests and cross-verification with other
validated methods to ensure assay consistency.
1. Reporting Results
• Report positive results if a specific band for Acanthamoeba
species DNA is observed in conventional PCR or if amplification
occurs in Real-Time PCR with a positive Ct value.
• Negative results are reported if no band is observed in
conventional PCR or if no amplification occurs in Real-Time PCR.
• Document all findings clearly including sample identification,
control results, PCR results, and any additional observations.
