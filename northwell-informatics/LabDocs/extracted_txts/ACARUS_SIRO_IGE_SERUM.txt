Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for ACARUS SIRO, IGE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE:
To ensure accurate and reliable results for ACARUS SIRO,
Immunoglobulin E (IgE), and Serum testing through standardized
procedures that include preparation, analysis, and reporting within
the analytical phase.
Responsibility:
Designated staff are responsible for performing the analytical phase
of testing and generating accurate results as defined in this
procedure. It is essential for all staff to identify any discrepancies or
issues that may affect the integrity of test results and report them to a
supervisor promptly. It is also the responsibility of staff and
supervisors to ensure all procedures are followed, including
corrective actions when necessary.
1. DEFINITIONS:
ACARUS SIRO: A specific allergen used to measure allergen-specific
IgE levels. IgE: Immunoglobulin E, an antibody associated with
allergic responses. Serum: The liquid part of blood that remains after
clotting, used for various biochemical assays.
1. PROCEDURE:
A. Reagents and Supplies:
• ACARUS SIRO allergen reagent kit.
• ImmunoCAP or equivalent IgE testing equipment.
• Serum collection tubes (e.g., SST tube).
• Calibrated pipettes.
• Laboratory-grade centrifuge.
• Incubator (temperature specific for procedure).
• Quality Control materials (Internal and external QC).
B. Preparation:
1. Ensure all reagents are stored as per manufacturer’s
instructions.
2. Validate the temperature of incubators and centrifuges
according to room ambient temperature procedures.
3. Prepare necessary Quality Control materials and validate their
expiry dates.
C. Sample Handling:
1. Ensure serum samples have arrived within the required stability
time and are properly labeled.
2. Centrifuge blood samples if necessary to separate serum.
3. Maintain serum samples at 2-8°C until analysis, avoiding
repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
D. Analytical Process:
1. ACARUS SIRO Specific IgE Testing:
a. Prepare the allergen reagent as per kit instructions. b. Load serum
samples onto ImmunoCAP or specified testing equipment. c.
Incubate samples following the specific reagent's recommended
temperature and time. d. Follow the equipment’s operational
procedures for reading and interpreting results.
1. Total Serum IgE Testing:
a. Prepare necessary IgE reagents. b. Load serum samples onto IgE
testing equipment. c. Incubate as per manufacturer's
recommendations. d. Measure and record IgE levels following
standard protocols.
E. Quality Control:
1. Internal QC:
a. Run quality control samples with each batch of patient samples. b.
Compare results to established control limits. c. Document all QC
results and actions taken for out-of-range results.
1. External QC:
a. Participate in inter-laboratory comparison studies as required. b.
Validate the performance of reagents and equipment based on
external QC data.
F. Reporting Results:
1. Review assay data for completeness and accuracy.
2. Validate results by comparing against established reference
intervals and QC data.
3. Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS) for
reporting.
4. Ensure critical values are communicated promptly, following
established critical value policies.
Reference Intervals:
• Refer to site-specific reference intervals documented in respective
procedural inserts for ACARUS SIRO and total Serum IgE.
Method Limitations:
• Consult individual reagent and equipment inserts for specific
limitations.
References:
• Manufacturer’s instructions for ACARUS SIRO allergen reagent
kit.
• ImmunoCAP instrumentation manual.
• National guidelines for IgE and serum testing.
This SOP must be reviewed annually and after any significant
procedural change to ensure compliance with updated guidelines and
technology improvements.
