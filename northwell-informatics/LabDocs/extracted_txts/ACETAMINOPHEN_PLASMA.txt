Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Procedure for Acetaminophen, Plasma
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this protocol is to provide a
standardized procedure for the quantitative analysis of
acetaminophen in plasma samples using an automated clinical
chemistry analyzer.
Responsibility: It is the responsibility of designated laboratory
personnel to follow this procedure accurately and efficiently. It is also
their responsibility to report any deviations or issues encountered
during analysis to the laboratory supervisor.
1. DEFINITION Acetaminophen (paracetamol) is a common
analgesic and antipyretic drug. The analysis of acetaminophen
levels in plasma is crucial for the management of patients
presenting with overdose or monitoring therapeutic levels in
certain clinical scenarios.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred/acceptable: Plasma collected in a lithium heparin tube.
• Unacceptable: Specimens collected in tubes containing EDTA,
citrate, or fluoride.
Specimen Handling and Stability:
• Centrifuge the specimens at 1500-2000 g for 10-15 minutes to
obtain plasma.
• If analysis is not conducted immediately, store plasma at 2-8°C for
up to 48 hours. For longer storage, freeze at -20°C or lower.
• Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Automated clinical chemistry analyzer equipped for drug testing
(e.g., Roche COBAS, Abbott Architect).
• Calibrators and controls specific to acetaminophen.
• Acetaminophen reagent kits approved for use on the chosen
analyzer.
• Quality control (QC) materials.
1. PROCEDURE A. Preparation
2. Ensure that the clinical chemistry analyzer, calibrators, controls,
and reagents are properly prepared and ready for use
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
3. Verify that the analyzer is calibrated for acetaminophen testing
with appropriate calibrators.
B. Analysis
1. Load calibrators, controls, and patient plasma samples onto the
analyzer.
2. Select the acetaminophen test profile on the analyzer’s
software.
3. The analyzer will automatically perform the following: a.
Aspiration of samples. b. Reaction with acetaminophen
reagent. c. Measurement of absorbance. d. Calculation of
acetaminophen concentrations based on calibration curves.
4. Review initial data for acceptability. Repeat analysis if QC
results are not within the acceptable range.
C. Quality Control
1. Run two levels of control (low and high) at the beginning of
each shift, with each new reagent lot, and with each calibration.
2. Record control results and ensure they fall within the
established QC range.
3. Investigate any QC failures by re-running controls, inspecting
reagents, and checking instrument performance.
4. REPORTING RESULTS
• Confirm that the acetaminophen concentrations fall within the
reportable range of the analyzer.
• If results are outside the reportable range, reanalyze the sample
or perform necessary dilutions as per the analyzer’s instruction
manual.
• Enter validated results into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS) and ensure proper documentation.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Therapeutic range: 10-30 µg/mL
• Potentially toxic range: > 150 µg/mL (4 hours post-ingestion)
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolysis, lipemia, and icterus can interfere with the
measurement. Highly hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples
should be reviewed carefully, and an appropriate comment should
be added to the result.
• Refer to the analyzer's manufacturer insert for specific limitations
and troubleshooting information.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instruction manual for the chosen automated
clinical chemistry analyzer.
• Relevant clinical chemistry textbooks and peer-reviewed literature
on acetaminophen analysis.
This SOP should be reviewed annually and revised as necessary to
accommodate new guidelines or improvements in testing
technologies.
