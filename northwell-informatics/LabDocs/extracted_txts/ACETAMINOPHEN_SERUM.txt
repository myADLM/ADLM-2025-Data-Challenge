Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Acetaminophen, Serum
Analysis
1. PURPOSE
To establish consistent procedures for the determination of
Acetaminophen levels in serum samples, ensuring accurate and
reproducible results.
2. DEFINITIONS
Acetaminophen is an analgesic and antipyretic medication. Its levels
in serum are monitored to prevent toxicity, especially in cases of
overdose.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated technologists are responsible for performing the testing
according to this procedure. They must ensure all steps are
completed with care and that control measures are observed.
Supervisors are responsible for overseeing the process, ensuring
compliance, and managing any deviations.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Analyzer (e.g., Beckman Coulter AU5800)
• Acetaminophen reagent kit (manufacturer-specific)
• Quality Control (QC) materials of known concentrations
• Calibrators traceable to standard references
• Serum sample collection tubes (no anticoagulant)
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
• Specimen Type: Serum
• Collection Tubes: Plain red-top tube or Serum Separator Tube
(SST)
• Stability:
◦ Room temperature: 8 hours
◦ 2-8°C: 48 hours
◦ -20°C or lower: 3 months (freeze/thaw cycles should be
avoided)
6. PROCEDURE
Pre-Analytical Phase
1. Specimen Preparation:
◦ Serum from a properly collected and processed blood
specimen is to be used.
◦ Ensure sample is free from hemolysis, icterus, and lipemia.
If present, notify the supervisor and initiate appropriate
measures as per laboratory policy.
Analytical Phase
1. Daily Calibration:
◦ Calibrate the analyzer using the manufacturer-provided
Acetaminophen calibrators, following the manufacturer’s
guidelines.
◦ Document calibration data appropriately in the calibration
log.
2. Quality Control:
◦ Run QC materials at two levels (low and high) at the
beginning of each shift, and after calibration or maintenance
procedures.
◦ Examine QC results to ensure they fall within acceptable
ranges before proceeding with patient samples.
◦ Document the QC results in the QC log. If QC fails,
troubleshoot according to the analyzer’s manual, recalibrate,
rerun QC, and consult the supervisor if issues persist.
3. Sample Analysis:
◦ Load patient serum samples onto the analyzer, following the
manufacturer's guidelines to avoid sample contamination or
carryover.
◦ Input sample identification details accurately into the
laboratory information system (LIS) to ensure traceability.
◦ Run the assay according to the analyzer's protocol.
4. Result Verification:
◦ Verify results according to site-specific acceptable criteria.
◦ For results that fall within the critical value range (reference
section), ensure to follow proper procedures for critical
result reporting.
◦ Any flagged results should be reviewed and rerun if
necessary.
5. Reporting:
◦ Transfer results from the analyzer to the LIS.
◦ Verify and validate results before releasing them to ensure
no transcription errors.
◦ Upon review, discrepancies or unexpected results should
prompt reanalysis or further investigation.
Post-Analytical Phase
1. Maintenance:
◦ After the day's tests are completed, perform daily
maintenance on the analyzer as per the manufacturer’s
guidelines.
◦ Document maintenance activities in the maintenance log.

8. REFERENCE INTERVALS AND CRITICAL VALUES
• Reference Interval: 10-30 µg/mL
• Critical Values: ≥ 50 µg/mL (requires immediate notification of
the physician/clinical team)
9. QUALITY CONTROL
Run QC materials at two levels (low and high) each shift, following
these rules:
• If either QC exceeds 2 standard deviations, re-run the controls.
• If the re-run fails, recalibrate the instrument and re-test the
controls.
• Persisting issues should lead to consultation with the supervisor
and possibly involve technical support.
10. SAFE HANDLING
• Wear PPE throughout the testing procedure.
• Handle all reagents and specimens according to institutional
biosafety guidelines.
11. TROUBLESHOOTING
Refer to the analyzer manual for error messages and guidelines.
Document any encountered issue and corrective action taken in the
maintenance log.
