Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analysis of
Acetoacetate in Serum
1. PURPOSE
To provide standardized and validated procedures for the analysis of
Acetoacetate (ACAC) in serum samples to ensure consistent,
accurate, and reliable results.
Responsibility:
All designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing
the analysis and documenting all observations as per this SOP.
Laboratory supervisors are responsible for ensuring compliance with
this procedure and reviewing the results for accuracy and
completeness.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen Type:
• Preferred: Serum
Specimen Collection:
• Collect blood sample via venipuncture using a serum separator
tube (SST).
• Allow the blood to clot by leaving it undisturbed at room
temperature for 15-30 minutes.
• Centrifuge the SST at 1500 x g for 10 minutes to separate the
serum from the clot.
Specimen Handling and Stability:
• After centrifugation, transfer the serum into a labelled aliquot tube.
• Serum samples should be analyzed immediately or stored at
2-8°C for up to 48 hours if the analysis cannot be performed
immediately.
• For long-term storage, freeze serum samples at -20°C or lower.
Samples are stable for up to 6 months at -20°C.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed samples
• Samples left at room temperature for longer than acceptable
stability time
• Incompletely filled SST tubes
3. REAGENTS AND MATERIALS
Reagents:
• Acetoacetate Assay Reagent Kit
• Calibrators and controls provided by the kit
• Deionized water for reagent preparation
Materials and Equipment:
• Centrifuge
• Micropipettes and tips
• Vortex mixer
• Incubator or water bath set to the temperature specified by the
reagent kit
• Spectrophotometer or appropriate analytical instrument for
measuring absorbance
4. PROCEDURE
Preparation of Reagents:
• Prepare assay reagents as per the manufacturer’s instructions
included in the Acetoacetate Assay Kit.
• Reconstitute calibrators and controls with deionized water or as
per the kit's instructions.
• Ensure all reagents are brought to room temperature before use.
Calibration:
• Perform a calibration curve using the provided calibrators.
• Pipette 10 µL of each calibrator into separate wells or cuvettes.
• Add 100 µL of the prepared Assay Reagent to each well.
Sample Preparation:
• Pipette 10 µL of serum samples and controls into separate wells
or cuvettes.
• Add 100 µL of the prepared Assay Reagent to each well
containing the serum sample or control.
Assay Procedure:
• Mix the contents of the wells or cuvettes by tapping gently or
vortexing.
• Incubate the mixture at the specified temperature (usually 37°C)
for 10-15 minutes.
• Measure the absorbance of each well at the wavelength specified
by the reagent kit (typically 340 nm) using a spectrophotometer.
Calculations:
• Calculate the concentration of Acetoacetate in the serum sample
by plotting the absorbance against the calibration curve.
• Use the slope and intercept from the calibration curve to
determine the Acetoacetate concentration in the test samples.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform quality control checks with each run of samples using the
provided control materials at least at two levels (low and high).
• Analyze the control samples following the same procedure as for
the test samples.
• Ensure that the control values fall within the acceptable ranges
provided with the assay kit.
• Document any deviations and take corrective actions if necessary.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results are reported in mmol/L.
• Enter all results into the LIS (Laboratory Information System) for
review and validation by the technologist.
• Review any flagged results and re-run samples as necessary to
confirm abnormal findings.
7. LIMITATIONS
• Hemolysis and lipemia may interfere with the assay results;
proper sample handling is critical.
• Ensure that all reagents are within their expiration date and have
been stored correctly.

9. DOCUMENTATION
• Record all observations, calculations, and data in the appropriate
laboratory records.
• Maintain records of all calibrations, quality control, and
maintenance activities in accordance with the laboratory's
documentation policies.
