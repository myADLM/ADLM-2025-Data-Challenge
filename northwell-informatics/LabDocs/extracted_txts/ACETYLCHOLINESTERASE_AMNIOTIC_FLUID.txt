Title: Standard Operating Procedure for the Analysis of
Acetylcholinesterase in Amniotic Fluid
1. PURPOSE To provide standardized procedures for the analysis
of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) in amniotic fluid samples. This
test is an important diagnostic tool used to detect neural tube
defects (NTDs) such as spina bifida and anencephaly.
Responsibility:
• It is the responsibility of trained medical laboratory scientists to
perform the analysis of acetylcholinesterase in amniotic fluid and
ensure accurate and timely reporting of results.
• All laboratory personnel must ensure adherence to the procedural
guidelines outlined in this SOP.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS Preferred Specimen:
• Amniotic fluid collected via amniocentesis as per standard
obstetric practice.
Specimen Handling and Storage:
• Store at 2-8°C and avoid freeze-thaw cycles to ensure sample
integrity.
• Analyze specimens within 72 hours of collection.
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Specimens with visible contamination or hemolysis.
• Specimens not stored/transported under proper conditions.
• Specimens with no collection date/time indicated on the container
or requisition.
1. REAGENTS, MATERIALS, AND EQUIPMENT
• AChE assay kit specific for amniotic fluid samples.
• Spectrophotometer or appropriate detection instrument.
• Calibration standards.
• Quality control materials of known AChE concentrations.
• Pipettes and tips.
• Centrifuge.
• Test tubes/collection vials.
• Data sheets and logbooks.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Use commercial AChE quality control materials, ensuring high
and low concentrations.
• Quality control must be performed with each run of patient
samples.
• Document all QC results and ensure they fall within acceptable
ranges as per manufacturer guidelines.
• If QC results are out of range, do not proceed with patient
samples until issues are resolved.
1. PROCEDURE A) Specimen Preparation:
2. Centrifuge the amniotic fluid samples at 1500 RPM for 10
minutes to remove any cellular debris.
3. Transfer the supernatant to a clean test tube.
4. If the supernatant appears unclear, repeat the centrifugation
step.
B) Assay Procedure:
1. Follow the procedure specified in the AChE assay kit insert.
Typically, this involves: a) Adding a specific volume of the
amniotic fluid sample to the reaction mixture provided in the kit.
b) Incubating the reaction at the specified temperature and
duration as per kit instructions. c) Measuring the absorbance or
other detection method as specified using a spectrophotometer.
2. Perform the calibration using standards provided in the AChE
assay kit and generate a calibration curve.
3. Compare the sample absorbance values to the calibration
curve to determine the concentration of AChE in the amniotic
fluid samples.
C) Documentation and Reporting:
1. Record the AChE concentrations of all patient samples,
including the date, time, and initials of the conducting
technologist.
2. Review results for any obvious discrepancies. If a result
appears inconsistent with clinical presentation or obtained QC
results, re-analyze the sample.
3. Results should be reviewed and verified by a second qualified
technologist before reporting.
4. Report results in the laboratory information system (LIS) and
include reference intervals:
◦ AChE: < [specific normal range as defined by the assay kit]
ng/mL (Consult the specific kit used for exact intervals).
5. MAINTENANCE Ensure regular maintenance and calibration of
the spectrophotometer and other related instruments as per
manufacturer's instructions. Conduct routine performance
checks and document all activities.
6. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Artifactual increases in AChE can occur if hemolysis is present in
the sample.
• Contaminated, improperly stored, or specimens outside the
defined window of collection may yield inaccurate results.
• Specific environmental conditions can interfere with the reagents
or the instrument performance; therefore, environmental controls
should be maintained as indicated by the kit manufacturer.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING
• Inconsistent results: Validate by checking calibration curves,
reagent expiration, and instrument performance.
• Out-of-range QC: Cease testing, investigate potential causes
including operator errors, reagent issues, and instrument
malfunctions, rectify, and re-run controls.
