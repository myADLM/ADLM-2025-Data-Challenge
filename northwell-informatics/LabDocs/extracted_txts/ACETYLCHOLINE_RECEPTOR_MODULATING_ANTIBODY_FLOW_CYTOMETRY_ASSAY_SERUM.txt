Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Acetylcholine Receptor Modulating Antibody,
Flow Cytometry Assay, Serum
1. Purpose:
To provide standardized methodology for the analysis of
Acetylcholine Receptor (AChR) Modulating Antibody in patient serum
samples using flow cytometry, ensuring accurate and reliable results
for the diagnosis and management of autoimmune myasthenia
gravis.
2. Scope:
This procedure applies to the analysis of serum samples received in
the laboratory for the detection and quantification of Acetylcholine
Receptor Modulating Antibodies using flow cytometry.
3. Responsibilities:
• It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory personnel to
perform the assay as described in this SOP.
• Laboratory personnel are responsible for ensuring the proper
function and calibration of the flow cytometer.
• Supervisors must review and verify that all procedures are
followed accurately and results are properly documented.
4. Specimen Requirements:
• Preferred Specimen: Fresh serum sample collected in a red-top
tube without any anticoagulants.
• Stability: Serum samples should be processed and tested within
24 hours of collection. If testing is delayed, serum should be
aliquoted and stored at -20°C. Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
• Unacceptable Specimens: Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric
specimens may interfere with the analysis and should be rejected.
5. Reagents and Supplies:
• Flow cytometer equipped with appropriate lasers and filters to
detect the fluorochrome-labeled antibodies.
• Acetylcholine Receptor modulating antibody detection kit
(commercially available).
• Fluorochrome-labeled secondary antibodies.
• PBS (phosphate-buffered saline), pH 7.4.
• FACS buffer (PBS/1% BSA/0.1% sodium azide).
• Fixation solution (1% paraformaldehyde in PBS).
• Acquisition tubes and labels.
6. Equipment:
• Flow cytometer
• Centrifuge
• Micropipettes and tips
• Vortex mixer
• Incubator (37°C)
• Refrigerator and freezer
7. Procedure:
A. Sample Preparation:
1. Thaw the stored serum samples at room temperature.
2. Vortex the samples gently to mix.
B. Incubation with Primary Antibody:
1. Aliquot 50 µL of serum into a labeled acquisition tube.
2. Add 50 µL of AChR antigen to each tube.
3. Incubate the mixture for 30 minutes at 37°C.
C. Washing:
1. Add 1 mL of FACS buffer to each tube.
2. Centrifuge the tubes at 300 x g for 5 minutes.
3. Carefully decant the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet
in 100 µL of FACS buffer.
D. Incubation with Secondary Antibody:
1. Add 10 µL of fluorochrome-labeled secondary antibody to each
tube.
2. Incubate for 30 minutes at 4°C in the dark.
E. Final Wash and Fixation:
1. Add 1 mL of FACS buffer to each tube.
2. Centrifuge at 300 x g for 5 minutes and decant the supernatant.
3. Resuspend the cells in 200 µL of PBS.
4. Add 200 µL of fixation solution and mix well.
F. Flow Cytometry Acquisition:
1. Set up the flow cytometer according to the manufacturer's
guidelines and daily QC protocols.
2. Adjust settings (voltages, compensation, etc.) using appropriate
controls.
3. Acquire at least 10,000 events for each sample.
4. Ensure all control samples (positive and negative) are included
in each run for quality assurance.
8. Data Analysis:
1. Analyze the data using compatible flow cytometry software.
2. Define appropriate gates and regions to identify AChR-positive
cells.
3. Quantify the percentage and mean fluorescence intensity (MFI)
of AChR-positive cells.
4. Compare patient results against established reference ranges
and controls.
5. Document findings in the laboratory information system (LIS).
9. Quality Control:
• Run internal quality controls (positive and negative controls) with
each batch of samples analyzed.
• Record any deviations and address corrective actions as
necessary.
• Perform regular calibration and maintenance of the flow cytometer
per the manufacturer’s recommendations.
10. Reporting Results:
• Results are reviewed for accuracy by the technologist.
• Report in the LIS for verification by senior laboratory personnel.
• Ensure results are communicated to the requesting physician
promptly.
11. Method Limitations:
• Specimen integrity is critical; hemolysis, lipemia, or improper
storage conditions can affect results.
• Cross-reactivity and nonspecific binding can cause false positive
or negative results.

By following this SOP, the detection and quantification of
Acetylcholine Receptor Modulating Antibodies in serum samples
using flow cytometry will be accurate, reliable, and consistent with
regulatory guidelines and laboratory best practices.
