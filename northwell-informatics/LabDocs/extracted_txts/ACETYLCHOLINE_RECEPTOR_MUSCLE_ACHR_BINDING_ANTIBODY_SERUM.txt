Protocol: Analytical Phase for ACETYLCHOLINE RECEPTOR
(MUSCLE ACHR) BINDING ANTIBODY, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
This protocol outlines the analytical procedures for generating results
for the Acetylcholine Receptor (Muscle AChR) Binding Antibody test
in serum specimens. This test is crucial for diagnosing autoimmune
disorders like myasthenia gravis and monitoring patients undergoing
treatment.
Responsibility:
Qualified laboratory technologists are responsible for performing the
analytical steps, ensuring specimen integrity, executing quality control
measures, and reporting results according to this protocol.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred Specimen:
• 5 mL of serum collected in a gold-top serum separator tube
(SST).
Unacceptable Specimen Conditions:
• Specimens containing visible hemolysis or lipemia.
• Specimens collected in EDTA, heparin, or citrate tubes.
• Specimens arriving in laboratory more than 48 hours after
collection without proper refrigeration (2-8°C).
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Precision Pipettes
• Centrifuge
• Water Bath
• Incubator
• ELISA Plate Reader
Reagents:
• Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) kit specific for
Muscle AChR Binding Antibody
• Calibrators and controls provided with the ELISA kit
• Deionized water for reagent preparation
Supplies:
• Micropipette tips
• Reaction plates and wells
• Gloves, lab coats, and appropriate PPE
1. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation:
1. Verify that the specimen meets acceptance criteria.
2. Thaw serum samples, if previously frozen, at room temperature
until liquid. Mix gently by inversion.
3. Set the incubator at the required temperature as specified by
the ELISA kit manufacturer (typically 37°C).
B) ELISA Procedure:
1. Label the reaction wells in accordance with the sample and
calibrators' identification.
2. Pipette the appropriate volume of calibrators, control sera, and
patient's serum into the designated wells as per the kit
instructions.
3. Add the enzyme conjugate reagent to each well in the specified
volume.
4. Incubate for the period listed in the kit instructions at the
specified temperature.
5. Wash wells multiple times with the wash buffer provided in the
kit to remove unbound components.
6. Add the substrate solution to each well. Incubate until color
development is achieved.
7. At the end of the incubation period, add the stop solution to halt
the reaction.
8. Read the optical density (OD) of each well using an ELISA plate
reader at the wavelength specified in the kit instructions
(usually 450 nm).
C) Interpretation of Results:
1. Determine the concentration of Muscle AChR Binding Antibody
in patient serum using the calibration curve obtained from the
standards.
2. Record both qualitative and quantitative findings in the
laboratory information system (LIS).
3. QUALITY CONTROL
4. Perform internal quality control using positive and negative
controls provided by the ELISA kit manufacturer.
5. Record all quality control results and validate quality control
measures according to the guidelines set by the manufacturer.
6. If quality control fails, do not release patient results and notify
the supervisor. Troubleshoot the issue by checking reagents
and procedures and re-run the assay if required.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
8. Review all results for consistency with quality control data.
9. Verify results in the LIS.
10. Critical results should be reported immediately to the requesting
healthcare provider, following laboratory policies on critical
value reporting.
11. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the ELISA kit insert for specific limitations, such as possible
interferences and cross-reactivity with other antibodies.
