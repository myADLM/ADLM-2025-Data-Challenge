PROTOCOL FOR THE ANALYTICAL PHASE OF GENERATING
RESULTS FOR ACETYL FENTANYL, UMBILICAL CORD TISSUE
1. PURPOSE To ensure accurate and timely testing of umbilical
cord tissue for the detection and quantification of acetyl
fentanyl. This procedure outlines the steps necessary for the
analysis and reporting of results according to laboratory
standards.
Responsibility: Laboratory technologists are responsible for
performing the analysis, ensuring quality control, documenting
results, and reporting findings as specified in this protocol.
1. DEFINITION Acetyl fentanyl is a potent synthetic opioid, and its
detection in umbilical cord tissue can indicate in-utero
exposure. This protocol pertains to the steps required to
process the tissue and the analysis method used to generate
reliable test results.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Umbilical cord tissue
• Volume: 2-3 cm of the umbilical cord length, refrigerated or frozen
• Stability: Stored at -20°C for long-term storage; can be kept at
4°C if analysis is planned within 48 hours
• Unacceptable Specimens: Specimens that are not properly
labeled, containers that are not properly sealed, tissue that is not
adequately cleaned from blood or contaminants
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Equipment:
◦ Analytical balance
◦ Laboratory-Grade Centrifuge
◦ Homogenizer
◦ LC-MS/MS (Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry)
◦ Vials and sample cups
◦ Pipettes and tips
• Reagents:
◦ Internal Standards (acetyl fentanyl-d5 or equivalent)
◦ Organic solvents (e.g., acetonitrile, methanol)
◦ Buffer solutions
◦ Extraction reagents and kits
◦ Calibration standards and quality controls
1. PROCEDURE
A) Specimen Preparation:
• Record the specimen details upon receipt.
• Store the specimen in a refrigerator or freezer until processing.
• Thaw if sample is frozen.
• Clean the umbilical cord tissue to remove blood and other
contaminants.
• Cut the tissue into smaller pieces and weigh approximately 1
gram of the cleaned tissue.
B) Homogenization and Extraction:
• Add appropriate volumes of internal standards and extraction
reagents to the tissue.
• Homogenize the tissue thoroughly.
• Centrifuge the homogenate at 2000 g for 5 minutes.
• Transfer the supernatant to a clean vial.
C) Clean-up and Preparation for Analysis:
• Perform appropriate clean-up procedures on the supernatant
(e.g., solid-phase extraction or liquid-liquid extraction).
• Dry down the cleaned extract under nitrogen if necessary.
• Reconstitute in an appropriate volume of mobile phase suitable
for LC-MS/MS.
D) LC-MS/MS Analysis:
• Calibrate the LC-MS/MS instrument according to the
manufacturer's guidelines.
• Validate the calibration using quality control samples.
• Prepare a batch sequence, ensuring the inclusion of blanks,
calibrators, QC samples, and patient specimens.
• Inject the prepared samples into the LC-MS/MS system.
• Acquire and process chromatographic data using validated
software.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include both low and high concentration quality control samples in
every analytical run.
• Run calibration standards at the beginning, middle, and end of the
sequence.
• Ensure internal standard peak areas are within acceptance
criteria.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Review all generated data for compliance with calibration and QC
criteria.
• Manually verify any results flagged by data processing software.
• Report results through the laboratory information system (LIS)
according to laboratory protocols.
• Document any deviations or issues encountered during the
analysis.
1. NOTE
• Reanalysis may be required to validate suspect results.
• Ensure all steps are compliant with laboratory safety standards.
• Consistently follow good laboratory practices and maintain
thorough and accurate records of all procedures and results.
