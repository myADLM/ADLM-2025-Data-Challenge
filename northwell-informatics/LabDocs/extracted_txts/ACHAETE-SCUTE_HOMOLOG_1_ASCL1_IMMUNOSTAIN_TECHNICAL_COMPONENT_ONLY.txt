STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP) FOR ACHAETE-
SCUTE HOMOLOG 1 (ASCL1) IMMUNOSTAIN, TECHNICAL
COMPONENT ONLY
1. PURPOSE
To outline the standardized analytical procedure for performing
immunohistochemical staining for Achaete-Scute Homolog 1
(ASCL1) in tissue specimens, ensuring accurate and reproducible
results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the laboratory personnel to follow this
protocol to prepare and stain tissue sections using ASCL1 antibodies,
to ensure high-quality and reproducibility of immunostaining.
Laboratory supervisors are responsible for ensuring compliance with
this procedure and for addressing deviations or issues that may
arise.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE)
tissue blocks.
• Section Thickness: 4-5 µm sections cut from the tissue block.
• Mounting Medium: Sections should be mounted on positively
charged glass slides.
4. REAGENTS, EQUIPMENT, AND SUPPLIES
• Primary antibody: Rabbit anti-ASCL1 (commercial source,
validated for IHC)
• Detection polymer/secondary antibody system (Horseradish
Peroxidase-conjugated polymer)
• DAB (3,3'-diaminobenzidine) chromogen and substrate kit
• Positive control tissue slides (e.g., confirmed ASCL1-positive
tumor tissue)
• Negative control tissue slides (e.g., isotype control)
• Xylene
• Ethanol series (100%, 95%, 70%)
• Deionized water
• Target retrieval solution (e.g., citrate buffer, pH 6.0)
• Blocking solution (e.g., normal goat serum)
• Hematoxylin
• Mounting medium
• Automated immunostainer (if available) or manual staining setup
• Microscope
5. PROCEDURE
Preliminary Preparation:
• Ensure FFPE tissue blocks are correctly identified and
accessioned.
• Cut 4-5 µm sections using a microtome and affix to positively
charged glass slides.
• Dry slide-mounted sections at 60°C for at least 1 hour to ensure
adherence.
Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
1. Place slides in a staining rack.
2. Deparaffinize sections by incubating slides in three changes of
xylene for 5 minutes each.
3. Rehydrate sections through a series of graded ethanol
solutions:
◦ 100% ethanol, three changes, 5 minutes each
◦ 95% ethanol, two changes, 3 minutes each
◦ 70% ethanol, two changes, 3 minutes each
4. Rinse slides in deionized water for 5 minutes.
Antigen Retrieval:
1. Immerse slides in a pre-heated target retrieval solution (e.g.,
citrate buffer, pH 6.0).
2. Perform heat-induced epitope retrieval (HIER) using a
microwave or pressure cooker, following the manufacturer's
recommendations (typically 15-20 minutes at near boiling
temperature).
3. Allow slides to cool in the retrieval solution for about 20
minutes.
4. Rinse slides in deionized water followed by Tris-buffered saline
(TBS) or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 5 minutes.
Blocking Non-specific Binding:
1. Incubate slides with a blocking solution (e.g., 10% normal goat
serum) for 20 minutes at room temperature to prevent non-
specific binding.
Primary Antibody Incubation:
1. Apply the primary antibody (rabbit anti-ASCL1) to the sections,
ensuring full coverage.
2. Incubate the slides for 60 minutes at room temperature or
according to manufacturer’s instructions.
3. Rinse slides with TBS/PBS three times for 2 minutes each.
Secondary Antibody Detection:
1. Apply the secondary antibody or labeled polymer (HRP-
conjugated) to the sections.
2. Incubate for 30 minutes at room temperature.
3. Rinse slides with TBS/PBS three times for 2 minutes each.
Chromogen Development:
1. Apply DAB chromogen solution to sections, monitoring the
development of brown staining.
2. Incubate for 5-10 minutes or until optimal staining is achieved.
3. Rinse slides in deionized water to stop the reaction.
Counterstaining:
1. Immerse slides in hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes to counterstain.
2. Rinse in running tap water for 5 minutes.
3. Dip slides briefly in 0.25% acid alcohol followed by a rinse in
deionized water.
4. Blueing slides in ammonium water (0.1% solution) for 1 minute.
Dehydration and Mounting:
1. Dehydrate sections through a graded ethanol series (70%,
95%, 100%) and clear in xylene.
2. Mount coverslips using a permanent mounting medium.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include positive and negative control slides in each staining run.
• Ensure control slides show appropriate staining patterns (positive
control for ASCL1 and no staining for negative control/isotype
control).
7. REPORTING RESULTS:
• Review stained sections under a microscope to ensure staining
quality.
• Document and report the presence or absence of ASCL1
immunostaining in specimens.
• Provide technical component results to the pathologist for
interpretation.

• Manufacturer’s instructions for the ASCL1 antibody and detection
kits.
