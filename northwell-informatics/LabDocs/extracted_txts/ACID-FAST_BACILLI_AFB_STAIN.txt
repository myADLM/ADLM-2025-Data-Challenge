Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Acid-Fast Bacilli (AFB)
Stain Analysis
1. PURPOSE: To detect the presence of acid-fast bacilli in clinical
specimens using staining techniques in order to aid in the
diagnosis of tuberculosis and other mycobacterial infections.
2. RESPONSIBILITY: Laboratory technologists are responsible
for performing the AFB stain, analyzing the stained slides,
documenting the results, and ensuring the proper operation and
maintenance of related equipment.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS: 3.1 Acceptable Specimens: -
Sputum (at least 3-5 mL, expectorated or induced) -
Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid - Gastric aspirates - Tissue
biopsies - Other body fluids (e.g., pleural fluid, cerebrospinal
fluid) 3.2 Specimen Handling: - Specimens should be
processed as soon as possible. - Delay in processing should be
avoided to prevent contamination or deterioration.
4. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS:
◦ Light microscope
◦ Carbol fuchsin (Ziehl-Neelsen method) or auramine-
rhodamine stains
◦ Acid alcohol decolorizer (e.g., 3% HCl in ethanol)
◦ Methylene blue (Ziehl-Neelsen method) or potassium
permanganate (for fluorescence)
◦ Standard laboratory glass slides
◦ Bunsen burner or slide warmer
◦ Wash bottle with distilled water
5. PROCEDURE:
A. Preparation of Smears:
◦ Using an applicator stick, spread a thin layer of specimen on
the labeled slide.
◦ Allow the smear to air dry completely. Failure to do so may
result in poor staining.
◦ Fix the smear by either passing the slide quickly through the
flame of a Bunsen burner 3-4 times or by placing the slides
on a slide warmer at 65-70°C for 2 hours.
B. Staining (Ziehl-Neelsen Method):
◦ Carbol Fuchsin Staining:
▪ Cover the smear with carbol fuchsin stain.
▪ Heat the slide gently until steam rises; avoid boiling.
Continue applying heat for 5 minutes ensuring
continuous steam.
▪ Let the slide cool and rinse with distilled water.
◦ Decolorization:
▪ Cover the smear with acid alcohol for 3-5 minutes until
the color stops leaching from the smear.
▪ Rinse the slide with distilled water.
◦ Counterstaining:
▪ Cover the smear with methylene blue for 1-2 minutes.
▪ Rinse the slide with distilled water and allow it to air dry.
C. Staining (Auramine-Rhodamine Fluorescence Method):
◦ Auramine-Rhodamine Staining:
▪ Cover the smear with auramine-rhodamine stain and
incubate at room temperature for 15 minutes.
▪ Rinse the slide with distilled water.
◦ Decolorization:
▪ Cover the smear with acid alcohol for 2 minutes.
▪ Rinse the slide with distilled water.
◦ Counterstaining:
▪ Cover the smear with potassium permanganate for 1
minute.
▪ Rinse the slide with distilled water and allow it to air dry.
6. MICROSCOPY:
◦ Perform the microscopy under oil immersion for Ziehl-
Neelsen or under fluorescence for auramine-rhodamine.
◦ Observe the entire smear for the presence of acid-fast
bacilli. AFB appears red against a blue background in the
Ziehl-Neelsen method and yellow or orange against a dark
background in fluorescence microscopy.
7. QUALITY CONTROL:
◦ Include both positive and negative control slides with each
batch of staining procedures to ensure the accuracy and
reliability of the staining method.
◦ Document control results with each batch analysis.
8. REPORTING RESULTS:
◦ Report results as "Acid-fast Bacilli Seen" or “No Acid-fast
Bacilli Seen”.
◦ Record any observations in the laboratory information
system (LIS), including the date, time, and identity of the
technologist performing the analysis.
9. LIMITATIONS:
◦ A negative result does not rule out infection as the number
of organisms may be below the detection limit.
◦ The presence of non-mycobacterial species (e.g., Nocardia)
may sometimes lead to non-specific acid-fast results.
10. REFERENCE:
◦ Manufacturer’s protocol inserts and standardized laboratory
guidelines.
11. RECORD KEEPING:
◦ Maintain logs of all AFB stain results, quality control
findings, and any corrective actions taken in case of
deviations or unexpected results.
By adhering to these protocols, laboratory scientists ensure accurate,
reliable, and timely results vital for patient diagnosis and
management.
