Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase of Generating Results for Acid-Fast
Smear for Mycobacterium
Department: Microbiology
Effective Date: [Insert Date]
Approved By: [Insert Name/Title]
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to outline the method for processing
and analyzing specimens for Acid-Fast Bacilli (AFB) to detect
Mycobacterium species using the acid-fast smear technique.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel trained to perform
Acid-Fast Smear testing within the microbiology laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the acid-
fast staining procedure, interpreting the results, and ensuring that all
documentation is completed accurately.
4. DEFINITIONS
Acid-Fast Bacilli (AFB): Bacteria, such as Mycobacterium species,
that resist decolorization by acids during staining procedures.
5. PROCEDURE
Materials and Equipment:
• Biological Safety Cabinet (BSC)
• Microscope
• Glass slides
• Sterile inoculating loop
• Bunsen burner or other heat source
• Carbolfuchsin solution
• Acid-alcohol decolorizer
• Methylene blue or malachite green counterstain
• Immersion oil
• Sterilization supplies (autoclave, etc.)
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
Specimen Preparation:
1. Specimen Types:
◦ Sputum
◦ Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluids
◦ Gastric washings
◦ Tissue biopsies
◦ Other body fluids, as required
2. Specimen Handling:
◦ Verify specimen identification with requisition.
◦ Use aseptic techniques to avoid contamination.
Staining Procedure:
1. Smear Preparation:
◦ Using an inoculating loop, place a small amount of the
specimen onto the center of a clean glass slide.
◦ Spread the specimen to create a thin, even smear.
◦ Air dry the smear completely.
◦ Heat-fix the smear by passing it through a flame three times.
2. Primary Staining:
◦ Apply carbolfuchsin solution to cover the entire smear.
◦ Heat gently until steam rises (do not boil).
◦ Allow the stain to sit for 5-10 minutes.
3. Decolorization:
◦ Rinse the slide briefly with water to remove surface
carbolfuchsin.
◦ Apply the acid-alcohol decolorizer until no more dye runs off
(approximately 1-2 minutes).
◦ Rinse the slide with water to stop the decolorization
process.
4. Counterstaining:
◦ Apply methylene blue or malachite green to cover the
smear.
◦ Allow the counterstain to sit for 1-2 minutes.
◦ Rinse the slide with water.
◦ Air dry or blot dry the slide.
Microscopy:
1. Place a drop of immersion oil on the stained smear.
2. Examine the slide under a microscope using the oil immersion
objective (100X).
3. Scan several fields (minimum 300) before making a result
determination.
Result Interpretation:
1. Positive Results:
◦ Presence of bright red bacilli against a blue or green
background.
◦ Report as "Acid-Fast Bacilli observed."
2. Negative Results:
◦ No red bacilli observed.
◦ Report as "No Acid-Fast Bacilli observed."
Quality Control:
1. QC Slides:
◦ Include both positive and negative control slides with each
batch of specimens stained.
◦ Ensure QC results are documented and reviewed.
2. Reagents:
◦ Verify the expiration dates of staining reagents regularly.
◦ Document the use of each reagent lot.
Cleaning and Safety:
1. Use appropriate PPE, including gloves, lab coat, and face
protection when handling and processing specimens.
2. Decontaminate work surfaces with an appropriate disinfectant
after each session.
3. Autoclave all contaminated materials before disposal.
6. REFERENCES
• Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines for
laboratory diagnosis of tuberculosis.
• Manufacturer’s instructions for carbolfuchsin, acid-alcohol
decolorizer, and methylene blue/malachite green stains.
7. DOCUMENTATION
• Maintain logs of specimens processed.
• Record all QC results and any corrective actions taken.
• Ensure that results are documented in the Laboratory Information
System (LIS) accurately.
8. REVIEW AND REVISION
This SOP shall be reviewed annually and updated as necessary to
reflect current standards and practices.
By following these steps meticulously, laboratory personnel can
ensure the reliable and accurate detection of Mycobacterium species
using the Acid-Fast Smear technique.
