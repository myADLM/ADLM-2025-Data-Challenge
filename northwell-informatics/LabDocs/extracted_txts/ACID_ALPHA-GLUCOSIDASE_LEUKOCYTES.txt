Standard Operating Procedure for the Analytical Phase of Generating
Results for Acid Alpha-Glucosidase, Leukocytes
1. Purpose: To provide clear instructions and ensure standardized
procedures for the analytical phase of measuring Acid Alpha-
Glucosidase (GAA) activity in leukocytes. These procedures
ensure accurate, reliable, and consistent results that meet
regulatory and internal quality standards.
2. Scope: This SOP applies to all personnel involved in the testing
of Acid Alpha-Glucosidase activity using leukocytes in the
clinical chemistry laboratory.
3. Responsibility: Staff members trained in biochemical techniques
and instrumentation shall perform the analytical procedures as
outlined. Laboratory supervisors are responsible for ensuring
the competency of personnel and adherence to this SOP.
4. Specimen Requirements:
• Acceptable Specimens: Whole blood collected in sodium heparin
(green-top) or EDTA (purple-top) tubes.
• Unacceptable Specimens: Hemolyzed samples, clotted samples,
incorrect anticoagulant, or samples not meeting transport and
storage criteria.
1. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies:
• Centrifuge (Refrigerated)
• Hemocytometer (or automated cell counter)
• T-25 flasks or equivalent
• Cell culture media
• Lysis buffer
• Fluorometric or spectrophotometric assay kit for GAA
• Microcentrifuge tubes
• Pipettes and tips
• Incubators
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
1. Procedure:
6.1. Leukocyte Isolation: i. Centrifuge whole blood at 500 g for 10
minutes at 4°C to separate the leukocyte layer (buffy coat). ii.
Carefully aspirate the buffy coat into a clean centrifuge tube. iii. Wash
the leukocytes twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) by
centrifuging at 300 g for 5 minutes at 4°C. iv. Resuspend the
leukocytes in a small volume of culture media.
6.2. Cell Counting: i. Count leukocytes using a hemocytometer or
automated cell counter. ii. Adjust the cell concentration to a standard
density (e.g., 1 x 10^6 cells/mL).
6.3. Cell Lysis: i. Resuspend leukocytes in lysis buffer as per the
assay kit instructions. ii. Incubate the suspension on ice for 30
minutes with gentle vortexing every 10 minutes. iii. Centrifuge the
lysate at 12,000 g for 10 minutes at 4°C. iv. Collect the supernatant
containing the cell lysate.
6.4. Enzyme Activity Assay: i. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions
for the fluorometric or spectrophotometric GAA assay kit. ii. Prepare
all necessary standards, controls, and samples. iii. Pipette the
reaction mixture into the assay wells according to the kit protocol. iv.
Add the cell lysate or control samples to the respective wells. v.
Incubate the plate at 37°C for the specified time (e.g., 1 hour). vi.
Measure fluorescence or absorbance using a suitable plate reader.
6.5. Data Analysis: i. Use the standard curve to quantify GAA activity
in each sample. ii. Express results as specific activity (e.g., nmol/hr/
mg protein).
1. Quality Control:
• Run quality control samples with known GAA activity levels in
each assay batch.
• Track QC results on a Levey-Jennings chart to monitor assay
performance over time.
• Document any deviations, corrective actions, and repeat testing
as necessary.
1. Reporting Results:
• Review and verify all data prior to reporting.
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
following verification by a qualified technologist.
• Notify clinicians of any critical values immediately as per
established communication protocols.
1. Safety and Waste Disposal:
• Follow all laboratory safety protocols, including the use of PPE
and proper handling of biological specimens.
• Dispose of waste, including biological materials and chemicals,
according to local regulations and laboratory guidelines.
1. References:
• Manufacturer’s instructions for the fluorometric or
spectrophotometric assay kit.
• Laboratory safety and quality assurance manuals.
By following this SOP, laboratory personnel can ensure the accuracy,
reliability, and consistency of Acid Alpha-Glucosidase activity
measurements in leukocytes, thereby supporting effective patient
diagnosis and management.
