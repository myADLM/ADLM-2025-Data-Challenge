Protocol for the Analytical Phase of Generating Results for ACID
ALPHA-GLUCOSIDASE REFLEX, LEUKOCYTES
1. PURPOSE
To provide guidelines for the analytical phase of generating results for
the ACID ALPHA-GLUCOSIDASE REFLEX, LEUKOCYTES test to
ensure accuracy, precision, and reliability of results.
2. SCOPE
This protocol applies to all laboratory personnel responsible for
performing ACID ALPHA-GLUCOSIDASE REFLEX, LEUKOCYTES
testing in the laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all designated laboratory staff to adhere to
this protocol when processing and analyzing specimens for the ACID
ALPHA-GLUCOSIDASE REFLEX, LEUKOCYTES test. Laboratory
supervisors are responsible for ensuring compliance and for
addressing any deviations from the protocol.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred Specimen: Leukocytes isolated from fresh whole
blood.
• Specimen Stability: Specimens must be kept refrigerated at
2-8°C and processed within 24 hours of collection.
• Unacceptable Specimens: Specimens that are hemolyzed,
clotted, or not properly labeled will be rejected.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Equipment: Centrifuge, microcentrifuge, incubator (37°C), water
bath, spectrophotometer or fluorometer.
• Reagents: Buffer solution, substrate (4-methylumbelliferyl-α-
glucopyranoside), internal control sample.
• Supplies: Pipettes, microcentrifuge tubes, test tubes, gloves, and
appropriate lab coats.
6. PROCEDURE
A) Isolation of Leukocytes:
1. Centrifuge the Blood Sample:
◦ Centrifuge whole blood at 1000xg for 10 minutes at room
temperature to separate leukocytes.
◦ Carefully collect the buffy coat layer containing leukocytes.
2. Wash the Leukocytes:
◦ Resuspend leukocytes in a buffer solution.
◦ Centrifuge at 300xg for 5 minutes.
◦ Repeat washing step twice.
B) Analysis of Acid Alpha-Glucosidase Activity:
1. Prepare Reaction Mixture:
◦ In a microcentrifuge tube, add 50 µL of leukocyte
suspension.
◦ Add 50 µL of buffer solution.
◦ Add 50 µL of substrate (4-methylumbelliferyl-α-
glucopyranoside).
2. Incubation:
◦ Incubate the reaction mixture at 37°C for 1 hour.
3. Terminate the Reaction:
◦ Add 200 µL of stopping solution to each tube.
◦ Mix thoroughly.
4. Measure Fluorescence:
◦ Measure the fluorescence of the reaction mixture using a
spectrophotometer or fluorometer.
◦ Use appropriate excitation and emission wavelengths
(commonly 360 nm and 450 nm).
C) Quality Control:
1. Internal Control Samples:
◦ Run internal control samples with known enzyme activity
alongside patient samples.
2. Result Acceptance Criteria:
◦ Confirm that control samples fall within the established
range for acceptable performance.
D) Corrective Actions:
• If internal controls fall outside of the acceptable range, re-evaluate
reagents, equipment calibration, and sample integrity.
• Repeat the assay if necessary.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Calculation:
◦ Calculate the enzyme activity based on fluorescence
readings relative to control.
◦ Report results in units/mg protein or activity units as
specified by the laboratory standards.
2. Verification:
◦ All results must be reviewed and verified by the technologist
before reporting.
3. Documentation:
◦ Document all steps taken, including any deviations from the
standard protocol.
◦ Record any corrective actions taken in response to issues
with internal controls or patient samples.
8. REFERENCE RANGES
• Reference ranges for enzyme activity should be established
based on population studies and documented in the laboratory
standard operating procedures.
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to the specific reagent and equipment manuals for any
limitations associated with the assay.
10. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions for the use of specific reagents and
equipment.
• Relevant clinical guidelines for the diagnosis and monitoring of
glycogen storage diseases.
11. REVIEW AND UPDATES
• This protocol shall be reviewed annually and updated as
necessary to reflect changes in best practices, equipment, or
reagents.
