Protocol for Generating Results for Acid Sphingomyelinase,
Leukocytes
1. PURPOSE To detail the analytical procedure for generating
results for Acid Sphingomyelinase in leukocytes in a CLIA-
certified laboratory, ensuring standardized and accurate
diagnostic results.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory staff are responsible for
performing the assays as outlined in this procedure and ensuring
accurate and timely reporting of results. Staff must also identify any
deficiencies or issues affecting the accuracy of laboratory test results
and report these to a supervisor.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
◦ Preferred specimen: 5 mL venous blood collected in a
lavender-top EDTA tube.
◦ Specimen stability: Specimen must be processed within 24
hours of collection and kept at 4°C after collection if not
processed immediately.
◦ Unacceptable specimens: Clotted specimens or specimens
not correctly labeled with both collection date and time will
be rejected.
2. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
◦ Flow cytometer
◦ Centrifuge
◦ Incubator
◦ Controlled water bath or heating block
◦ EDTA tubes and pipettes
◦ Suitable leukocyte isolation kit
◦ Acid Sphingomyelinase assay kit (commercially available or
validated in-house)
◦ Standard calibration materials
3. PROCEDURE
A. Leukocyte Isolation: 1. Perform leukocyte isolation using the
commercially available kit or validated protocol. 2. Centrifuge the
blood sample at 2000 RPM for 10 minutes at 4°C. 3. Remove plasma
and resuspend leukocyte pellet in isolation buffer according to the kit
or validated procedure.
B. Acid Sphingomyelinase Assay: 1. Adjust leukocyte concentration
as indicated in the assay kit manual. 2. Incubate the leukocytes with
the substrate specific to Acid Sphingomyelinase in the controlled
water bath or heating block set at 37°C for the specified duration. 3.
After incubation, terminate the reaction according to the assay
instructions and proceed with the manufacturer's or validated protocol
for detection. 4. Analyze the reaction product using the flow
cytometer or specified detection equipment, ensuring all calibration
and control checks are performed prior to the patient sample
analysis.
C. Quality Control: 1. Run internal quality controls with each batch of
assays to ensure assay accuracy; these include negative and
positive controls stated in the assay kit instructions. 2. Document all
reagent lot numbers, expiration dates and validation records. 3.
Calibrate all analyzers (incubator, centrifuge, flow cytometer) and
record the calibration data.
D. Reporting Results: 1. Results should be reviewed by a certified
technologist to ensure accuracy and validity before entry into the
Laboratory Information System (LIS). 2. Any results outside reference
intervals or with quality control flags should be validated, and
corrective steps should be documented according to laboratory SOP.
3. Enter the final results into the LIS with corresponding comments
and reference intervals.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS Refer to specific kit manufacturer's
instructions or internally validated reference ranges.
2. METHOD LIMITATIONS Refer to Acid Sphingomyelinase Assay
kit insert for individual component limitations and
troubleshooting guide. Note that hemolysis, improper specimen
storage, and delayed processing can impact results accuracy.
3. REFERENCES Appropriate product inserts and validation
documents for Acid Sphingomyelinase Assay kit and leukocyte
isolation kit.
This protocol was last reviewed and updated in October 2023.
Ensure to check for any amendments or updates in assay kits and
quality control practices.
By following this protocol, laboratory personnel will be able to
effectively process and report results for Acid Sphingomyelinase from
Leukocytes, maintaining diagnostic accuracy and compliance with
CLIA standards.
