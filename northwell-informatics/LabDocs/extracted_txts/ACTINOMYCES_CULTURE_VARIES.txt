Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Actinomyces Culture,
Various Specimens
1. Purpose: To provide a standardized protocol for the detection
and identification of Actinomyces species from various clinical
specimens through culture methods to ensure accurate and
reliable results.
2. Responsibility: The responsibility for processing and analyzing
Actinomyces cultures lies with trained laboratory personnel. It is
the duty of the designated laboratory staff to follow the
procedures outlined in this SOP and to report any irregularities
or issues to the supervisor.
3. Scope: This SOP covers the procedures for the culture,
isolation, identification, and reporting of Actinomyces species
from clinical specimens.
4. Specimen Requirements: Specimens suitable for Actinomyces
culture include pus, tissue, and other body fluids. Specimens
should be collected aseptically and transported to the
laboratory promptly, ideally within 2 hours of collection.
Acceptable specimen containers: - Sterile screw-capped
containers - Anaerobic transport medium - Plain dry swabs in a
sterile tube (avoiding transport media that does not support
anaerobes) Unacceptable specimens: - Specimens collected or
transported improperly. - Specimens older than 24 hours if not
stored in appropriate conditions.
5. Equipment and Reagents:
◦ Anaerobic Chamber or Jars
◦ Incubator set to 35-37°C
◦ Blood Agar Plates
◦ Chocolate Agar Plates
◦ Anaerobic Blood Agar Plates
◦ Thioglycollate Broth
◦ Gram Stain Reagents
◦ Catalase test Reagents
6. Procedure:
A. Specimen Processing: 1. Examine the specimen for suitability. If
unacceptable, notify the submitting clinician. 2. Perform a direct
Gram stain on the specimen and note the presence of branching
Gram-positive rods indicative of Actinomyces.
B. Culture Media Inoculation: 1. Inoculate the specimen onto the
following media: - Blood Agar Plate (BAP) - Chocolate Agar Plate
(CAP) - Anaerobic Blood Agar Plate - Thioglycollate Broth 2. Streak
the inoculated plates for isolation and label with patient information,
date, and specimen type.
C. Incubation: 1. Incubate BAP and CAP plates in a CO2-incubator at
35-37°C. 2. Incubate the anaerobic blood agar plate in an anaerobic
chamber or anaerobic jar with an appropriate gas pack. 3. Incubate
the Thioglycollate broth at 35-37°C. 4. Plates should be incubated for
a minimum of 7 days to allow adequate growth time for slow-growing
Actinomyces species, examining them daily for growth.
D. Identification: 1. Observe the plates daily for growth. Actinomyces
colonies near the edge of growth may exhibit a "molar tooth"
appearance. 2. Perform a Gram stain on suspicious colonies.
Actinomyces appear as Gram-positive bacilli with characteristic
branching. 3. Conduct additional biochemical tests such as: -
Catalase test (Actinomyces species are typically negative) - Other
differentiating tests as needed
E. Quality Control: 1. Use known reference strains of Actinomyces for
quality control purposes. 2. Perform quality control checks on media
and reagents regularly. 3. Document and review quality control
results according to laboratory guidelines.
1. Reporting Results:
1. Report all relevant findings, including the presence of
Gram-positive branched rods from Gram stains and
culture results.
2. Notify the clinician immediately if Actinomyces is
identified.
3. Record all results in the Laboratory Information System
(LIS) and verify by a qualified technologist before
releasing results.

3. Revisions:
◦ Any changes or updates to this SOP should be documented
and reviewed regularly to reflect best practices and
advances in testing methods.
◦ Last Revised: October 2023
4. Notes:
◦ Proper personal protective equipment (PPE) must be worn
at all times.
◦ Handle all clinical specimens as if they are potentially
infectious.
◦ Ensure proper disposal of biohazard waste and
decontamination of work surfaces.
