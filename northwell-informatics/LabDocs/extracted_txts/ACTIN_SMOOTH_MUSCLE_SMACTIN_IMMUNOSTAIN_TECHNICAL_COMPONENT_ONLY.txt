Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for ACTIN, SMOOTH
MUSCLE (SMACTIN) IMMUNOSTAIN, TECHNICAL COMPONENT
ONLY
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the immunohistochemical
staining of Actin, Smooth Muscle (SMACTIN) in tissue specimens at
our CLIA-certified laboratory. This procedure outlines the necessary
steps to ensure consistent, reliable, and accurate results for the
technical component only.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
◦ Specimen Type: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE)
tissue specimens.
◦ Specimen Volume: Standard tissue sections, typically 3-5
microns thick.
◦ Unacceptable Specimens: Specimens not fixed in
formalin, improperly paraffin-embedded tissues, or those
with inadequate volume.
2. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
◦ Equipment:
▪ Microtome
▪ Water bath
▪ Slide racks and trays
▪ Immunostaining instruments (automated or manual)
▪ Light microscope
◦ Reagents:
▪ Primary antibody: Anti-Actin, Smooth Muscle
▪ Secondary antibody (if required)
▪ Detection system: Appropriate chromogen (e.g., DAB)
▪ Counterstain: Hematoxylin
▪ Mounting medium
◦ Supplies:
▪ Positive control slides
▪ Superfrost Plus slides
▪ Xylene and ethanol for deparaffinization and rehydration
▪ Buffer solution (e.g., Tris-buffered saline)
▪ Coverslips
3. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation and Sectioning of Specimen Slides:
1. Section the FFPE tissue block at 3-5 microns using a
microtome.
2. Float sections on a water bath at approximately 40-45°C.
3. Mount sections on Superfrost Plus slides and air-dry
overnight at room temperature or incubate at 60°C for 30
minutes.
B. Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
1. Place slides in a slide rack and immerse in xylene for
three changes, 5 minutes each to deparaffinize.
2. Rehydrate through graded ethanol series (100%, 95%,
70%) for 2 minutes each.
3. Rinse in distilled water and immerse in buffer solution
(e.g., Tris-buffered saline) for 5 minutes.
C. Antigen Retrieval:
1. Perform antigen retrieval using a heat-induced epitope
retrieval (HIER) method: Immerse slides in retrieval
solution and heat in a microwave or pressure cooker per
manufacturer instructions.
2. Allow slides to cool at room temperature for 20 minutes.
3. Rinse in buffer solution for 5 minutes.
D. Immunostaining:
1. Apply primary antibody to each slide and incubate in a
humidified chamber at room temperature for 30-60
minutes.
2. Rinse slides in Tris-buffered saline, three times, 2 minutes
each.
3. Apply secondary antibody (if required) according to
manufacturer's instructions and incubate accordingly.
4. Rinse slides in Tris-buffered saline, three times, 2 minutes
each.
5. Apply detection system (such as DAB) and develop color
per manufacturer's instructions.
6. Rinse slides in distilled water.
E. Counterstaining and Mounting:
1. Counterstain slides with hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes.
2. Rinse in running tap water for 10 minutes.
3. Dehydrate through graded ethanol series (70%, 95%,
100%).
4. Clear in xylene, two changes for 5 minutes each.
5. Mount with synthetic resin and coverslip.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Run a positive control slide with every batch of patient
specimens to validate staining.
◦ Expected result for positive control: Strong cytoplasmic
staining in smooth muscle.
◦ Negative control: Use non-immune serum instead of the
primary antibody on an additional section.
5. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ Technical component only: Provide slides to the requesting
pathologist or facility.
◦ Ensure that all slides are properly labeled with patient
identifiers, date of staining, and any pertinent information as
required.
6. REFERENCES
◦ Manufacturer's instructions for primary and secondary
antibodies.
◦ Standard laboratory guidelines for immunohistochemistry.
◦ CDC's Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI)
guidelines.
7. REVISION HISTORY
◦ Document effective date, revision dates, and summary of
changes for future reference.
By following this SOP, the laboratory ensures a standardized and
high-quality approach to the technical component of Actin, Smooth
Muscle (SMACTIN) immunostaining, leading to reliable and accurate
test results.
