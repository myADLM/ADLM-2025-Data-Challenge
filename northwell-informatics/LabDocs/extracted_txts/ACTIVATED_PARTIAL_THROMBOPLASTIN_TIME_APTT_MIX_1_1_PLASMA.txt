Protocol for Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (APTT) Mix 1:1,
Plasma
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for performing Activated Partial
Thromboplastin Time (APTT) 1:1 mix testing to evaluate clotting
abnormalities and possible factor deficiencies or inhibitors in plasma
samples.
Responsibility:
Designated staff will perform the APTT 1:1 mix test according to the
protocols outlined in this procedure. It is the responsibility of all staff
to ensure accurate, reliable, and timely results, and to notify a
supervisor if any issues arise during testing.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND ACCEPTABILITY
CRITERIA
Specimen:
Preferred:
• Citrated plasma collected in a 3.2% sodium citrate blood
collection tube.
• Ensure proper venipuncture technique to minimize hemolysis.
• Fill the tube completely to avoid dilution errors.
Unacceptable:
• Specimens in lithium heparin, sodium heparin, EDTA, or other
anticoagulants.
• Specimens with visible hemolysis.
• Specimens received more than 4 hours post-collection unless
stored at 2-8°C for up to 24 hours.
• Specimens with incorrect labels or missing collection date/time.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Coagulation analyzer (e.g., Sysmex CA-630, STA Compact)
• Pipettes and tips
• Standard APTT reagents (pre-warmed as necessary)
• Normal pooled plasma (for 1:1 mix)
• Controls (including abnormal and normal levels)
Reagents should be stored according to manufacturer instructions,
and must not be used past expiration dates.
1. PROCEDURE
Specimen Preparation:
1. Centrifuge citrated tubes at 1500-2000g for 10-15 minutes to
obtain platelet-poor plasma.
2. Carefully transfer plasma aliquots into labeled test tubes
without disturbing the cell layer.
3. For the 1:1 mix, combine patient plasma and normal pooled
plasma in equal parts (volumes typically of 0.5 mL each).
Testing:
1. Turn on the coagulation analyzer and ensure daily calibration
and quality control checks are acceptable.
2. Pipette the 1:1 mix plasma aliquot (patient + normal pooled
plasma) into the sample cup of the analyzer.
3. For each sample cup, pipette the appropriate volume of APTT
reagent for the analyzer, as recommended by the machine
manufacturer.
4. Add calcium chloride (or corresponding reagent) to initiate
clotting and start timing.
5. Record the time taken for clot formation in seconds.
Interpretation and Reporting Results:
1. The APTT time for the patient’s plasma alone and the 1:1 mix
should be compared:
◦ If the mixing study corrects the prolonged APTT to near
normal ranges, this may indicate a factor deficiency.
◦ If the APTT remains prolonged, it may indicate the presence
of an inhibitor.
Quality Control:
• Perform APTT testing on control samples (normal and abnormal)
every testing session.
• Record control results to ensure they fall within expected ranges.
• Address out-of-range control results by investigating potential
procedural errors, equipment malfunction, or reagent issues.
Reporting Results:
• Enter APTT results into LIS ensuring detailed and accurate
documentation of the patient’s identifier, collection date, time, and
test results.
• Critical values must be flagged and promptly reported following
laboratory policy.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to manufacturer inserts for method limitations, including factors
that may affect clotting times like anticoagulant drugs, sample
handling, or cold activation.
