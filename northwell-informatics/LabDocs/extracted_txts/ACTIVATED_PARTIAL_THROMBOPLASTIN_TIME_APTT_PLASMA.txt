Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Performing Activated
Partial Thromboplastin Time (APTT) Test
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is to
provide a standardized method for performing Activated Partial
Thromboplastin Time (APTT) testing on plasma samples.
1. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all personnel in the laboratory responsible
for performing and reporting APTT results.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
All designated laboratory personnel performing APTT assays are
responsible for adhering to this SOP. Supervisors are responsible for
ensuring compliance and proper training.
1. PRINCIPLE
The APTT test measures the time it takes for a clot to form in plasma
after the addition of calcium and a partial thromboplastin reagent.
This test evaluates the intrinsic and common pathways of the
coagulation cascade and helps in the detection of coagulation
disorders, monitoring of heparin therapy, and determining the
presence of lupus anticoagulant.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred specimen: 2.7 mL citrated plasma (blue-top tube) with
3.2% sodium citrate anticoagulant.
• Unacceptable specimens: Hemolyzed samples, clotted samples,
and samples that have not been filled to the indicated volume line.
• Specimen stability: Citrated plasma should be tested within 4
hours of collection if stored at room temperature (15-25°C), or
within 24 hours if stored at 2-8°C.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Centrifuge
• Coagulation analyzer (e.g., Sysmex CS-2500)
• Commercially available APTT reagent (e.g., Actin FSL)
• Calcium chloride solution (0.025 M)
• Plastic test tubes
• Pipettes and tips
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
• Quality Control materials (e.g., normal and abnormal controls)
1. PROCEDURE
A. SAMPLE PREPARATION
1. Properly label the sample tube and verify patient information.
2. Centrifuge the citrated plasma sample at 1500 x g for 15
minutes to obtain platelet-poor plasma (PPP).
3. Carefully transfer the PPP to a new, clean plastic tube without
disturbing the platelet layer. Do not pour; use a transfer pipette.
B. ANALYSIS
1. Turn on the coagulation analyzer and allow it to warm up as per
manufacturer instructions.
2. Perform a daily quality control check using normal and
abnormal control materials. Record results in the QC log. If
controls are out of range, troubleshoot and recalibrate the
instrument as necessary before proceeding.
3. Load the prepared PPP samples and reagents into the
coagulation analyzer according to the manufacturer’s
guidelines.
4. Select the APTT assay on the analyzer’s menu.
5. Follow the analyzer prompts to add the APTT reagent to the
PPP sample and incubate for the specified time.
6. The analyzer will automatically add calcium chloride to initiate
the clotting process and measure the clotting time (APTT
result).
C. INTERPRETATION AND REPORTING
1. Review the APTT results generated by the analyzer.
2. Compare patient results to known reference ranges (typically
25-35 seconds for adults, can vary by laboratory standard).
3. Verify any abnormal results by retesting the sample. If results
are confirmed, proceed to report.
4. Enter patient results into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
5. For critical values (e.g., APTT > 100 seconds), notify the
ordering physician or relevant healthcare provider immediately
as per laboratory policy and document the communication.
6. QUALITY CONTROL AND MAINTENANCE
• Ensure all quality control materials are tested at least once per
shift.
• Maintain and calibrate the coagulation analyzer according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
• Document all maintenance and calibration activities.
• Regularly perform proficiency testing and participate in external
quality assurance programs.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolyzed or improperly collected/handled samples may give
erroneous results.
• Certain medications, inhibitors, and coagulation factor
deficiencies can affect APTT results.
• Presence of elevated levels of fibrin degradation products (FDP)
can prolong APTT.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s operator manual for the coagulation analyzer.
• CLSI guidelines (Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute) for
coagulation testing.
• Laboratory's quality management system documentation.
1. REVIEW AND DOCUMENTATION
• SOP review and updates should be conducted annually or as
necessary.
• Document any changes or updates to this SOP.
This SOP effectively ensures the accurate, reliable, and timely
reporting of APTT results for patient care and diagnosis. All personnel
must be thoroughly trained in this procedure.
