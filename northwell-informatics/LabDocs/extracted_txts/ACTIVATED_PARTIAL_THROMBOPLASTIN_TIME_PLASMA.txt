Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT), Plasma
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this procedure is to outline the
method for performing an Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time
(aPTT) test, which measures the time taken for a clot to form in
a blood plasma sample after the addition of calcium chloride
and an activator of intrinsic coagulation.
Responsibility: The Medical Laboratory Scientist is responsible for
performing this test and documenting the results as per laboratory
policy. It is also their responsibility to ensure that quality control
measures are adhered to for accurate and reliable results.
1. SCOPE This procedure applies to all clinical laboratory staff
who are trained to perform and report aPTT testing.
2. DEFINITIONS aPTT - Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time, a
test that measures the intrinsic pathway of coagulation.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY Specimen type:
Plasma obtained from citrated blood. Collection: Blood should
be collected in a 3.2% sodium citrate tube. Volume: Preferably
2.7 mL of blood (light blue top tube) filled to the mark. Handling:
Invert the collection tube gently at least 5 times to mix the blood
with the anticoagulant. Stability: Plasma should be separated
from cells within 1 hour of collection. If testing is delayed,
plasma may be stored for up to 4 hours at room temperature
(18-24°C) or up to 8 hours at 2-8°C. For longer storage, plasma
can be frozen at -20°C or lower for up to two weeks.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• aPTT reagent containing phospholipids and an activator (ellagic
acid, kaolin, silica, or celite)
• 0.025 M CaCl2 (Calcium Chloride) reagent
• Coagulometer or semi-automated clot detection instrument
• Appropriate controls (Normal and Abnormal Control Plasma)
• Pipettes and tips
• Water bath or heating block (37°C)
• Timer
• Cuvettes or test tubes
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run control samples with each batch of patient samples.
• Use at least two levels of control (e.g., normal and abnormal).
• Ensure control results are within the defined acceptable range
before testing patient samples.
• Document control results in the quality control log.
• If control results fall outside of the acceptable range, troubleshoot
the issue, determine the cause, and rectify it before proceeding
with patient samples.
1. PROCEDURE
2. Set up the coagulometer or semi-automated clot detection
instrument according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
3. Thaw frozen plasma samples and controls at 37°C for 15
minutes (if applicable).
4. Prepare reagents and allow them to reach room temperature
before use.
5. For each test, pipette 100 µL of plasma into a cuvette or test
tube.
6. Add 100 µL of aPTT reagent to the plasma and mix. Incubate
the mixture at 37°C for 3 minutes.
7. Add 100 µL of 0.025 M CaCl2 to the mixture while starting the
timer simultaneously, or as automated by the instrument.
8. Record the time taken for the plasma to clot (in seconds).
9. Report the result as activated partial thromboplastin time
(aPTT).
10. RESULT INTERPRETATION Normal Range: Typically 25-35
seconds
• Reference ranges may vary by laboratory; refer to specific
laboratory policy or the instrument manufacturer's guidelines for
the established normal range.
• Abnormally prolonged aPTT may indicate deficiencies in factors
VIII, IX, XI, or XII, the presence of inhibitors such as lupus
anticoagulants, or the presence of heparin or other anticoagulant
therapy.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Review results to ensure they are within acceptable ranges.
• Enter patient results and control results into the Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
• Verify that all critical values are promptly reported to the
requesting physician as per laboratory policy.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolyzed or lipemic samples may affect the test results.
• Inadequate mixing of blood with the anticoagulant may lead to
inaccurate results.
• The presence of heparin or other anticoagulants within the
sample may prolong clotting time.
1. SAFETY AND UNIVERSAL PRECAUTIONS
• Use appropriate PPE such as gloves, lab coat, and face shield (if
aerosols are generated) during the procedure.
• Follow the laboratory’s biosafety guidelines for handling and
disposing of human specimens and reagents.

1. DOCUMENTATION All steps, including quality control and
patient test results, will be documented and maintained
according to laboratory policy. Any deviations or issues
encountered during testing must be recorded and reported to
the laboratory supervisor.
