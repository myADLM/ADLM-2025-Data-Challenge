Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
1. PURPOSE
To define the analytical procedures for performing Activated Protein C
Resistance (APCR) testing in blood specimens using the specified
laboratory protocols to ensure accurate, consistent, and reliable
results.
Responsibility: Designated staff members are responsible for
conducting the APCR testing as per this SOP. It is the responsibility
of all staff members to ensure adherence to this procedure and report
any issues to the laboratory supervisor immediately.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type: Citrate anticoagulated plasma (light blue-top tube)
Volume: Minimum of 3 mL of blood Specimen Storage: Specimens
should be processed within 4 hours of collection. If testing is to be
delayed, the plasma should be frozen at -20°C or lower until analysis.
Unacceptable Specimens: Hemolyzed, lipemic, or clotted specimens,
specimens collected in anticoagulants other than citrate (e.g., EDTA,
heparin), or improperly labeled specimens.
1. REAGENTS, SUPPLIES, AND EQUIPMENT
Reagents:
• APCR Test Kit (including Activated Protein C reagent)
• Calcium chloride solution
• Control Plasmas (Normal APCR Control, Abnormal APCR
Control)
Equipment:
• Coagulation Analyzer (calibrated and quality control verified)
• Centrifuge
• Micropipettes and tips
• Timer
• Gloves and personal protective equipment (PPE)
Supplies:
• Test tubes
• Pipettes and tips
• Parafilm or caps for tubes
• Logbooks and documentation forms
1. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation
1. Follow universal precautions and wear appropriate PPE.
2. Centrifuge the citrate blood specimen at 1500 x g for 15
minutes within 4 hours of collection to obtain platelet-poor
plasma.
3. Aliquot plasma into a clean, properly labeled tube and freeze
any surplus plasma immediately if not used for immediate
testing.
B) Calibration and Quality Control
1. Perform instrument calibration as per manufacturer’s
instructions.
2. Run normal and abnormal control plasmas before patient
samples. Acceptable control limits must be verified before
proceeding with patient sample analysis.
3. Document control results in the appropriate logbook.
C) Analysis
1. Thaw the plasma samples (if stored) rapidly at 37°C and mix
gently.
2. For each sample, adjust the coagulation analyzer settings as
specified in the APCR Test Kit insert.
3. Pipette the specified volume of patient plasma, control plasma,
and reagents into the designated cuvette or reaction well
according to the manufacturer's instructions.
4. Add the appropriate volume of calcium chloride solution to
initiate the clotting reaction.
5. Measure the clotting time with and without the addition of
Activated Protein C (APC) reagent using the coagulation
analyzer.
D) Calculation and Reporting
1. Calculate the APC resistance ratio (APC-R) using the formula
provided in the APCR Test Kit instructions.
2. Compare the APC-R value to the reference range specified for
the test.
◦ Normal range: APC-R > 2.0
◦ APC Resistance: APC-R ≤ 2.0
3. Verify and review test results. Enter results into the Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
4. Report any critical values to the requesting clinician promptly,
following laboratory policy for critical result notification.
5. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If control results fall outside acceptable limits, retest the controls.
If the issue persists, recalibrate the instrument and recheck the
reagents.
• For any discrepancies in patient results, re-extract and reanalyze
the sample. Confirm all steps and reagents used.
• Consult the supervisor or on-call technical support if
troubleshooting steps do not resolve the issues.
1. DOCUMENTATION
• Record all control and patient test results in the appropriate
logbooks and LIS.
• Document any deviations, corrective actions, or issues
encountered during testing and resolution in the incident logbook.
• Maintain calibration records, quality control logs, and test records
for future reference and compliance audits.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's instructions and package inserts for APCR Test Kit
and Coagulation Analyzer.
• Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines for
coagulation testing.
• In-house laboratory quality control policies and procedures.
Ensure that all procedures and practices comply with regulatory
standards and CLIA certification requirements.
1. REVIEW AND APPROVAL
This SOP will be reviewed annually or as needed by the laboratory
management and the quality control committee. Any updates or
modifications will be communicated to all relevant personnel with
formal training sessions if necessary.
