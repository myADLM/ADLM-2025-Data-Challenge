Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Activated Protein C Resistance (APCRV) in
Plasma
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedures for the analytical
phase of generating results for Activated Protein C Resistance
(APCRV) in plasma. This ensures accuracy, reliability, and
reproducibility of test results.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for following the
procedures outlined in this SOP for APCRV testing. It is the
responsibility of supervisors to ensure that staff are adequately
trained and that the procedures are followed consistently.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred Specimen:
• Freshly collected citrated plasma (3.2% sodium citrate). Ensure
proper mixing by inverting the collection tube 5-10 times
immediately after collection.
• Volume required: Minimum 1 mL of plasma.
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Specimens that are clotted or hemolyzed.
• Specimens collected in incorrect anticoagulant (e.g., EDTA,
heparin).
• Insufficient volume.
• Specimens arriving at the laboratory more than 4 hours after
collection if not refrigerated.
Specimen Handling:
• If transport time exceeds 4 hours, specimens should be
refrigerated at 2-8°C and must arrive at the laboratory within 24
hours of collection.
• Specimens must be brought to room temperature prior to
analysis.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Coagulation analyzer (e.g., Sysmex CA-1500)
• Activated Protein C Resistance reagent kit (e.g., Chromogenix
Coatest APC Resistance V kit)
• Citrated plasma tubes
• Calibrators and controls specific to the APCRV assay
• Pipettes and tips
• Timer
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
1. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
• Ensure all equipment is calibrated and functioning properly prior
to testing.
• Allow all reagents and controls to reach room temperature.
• Review specimen integrity as per acceptance criteria mentioned
above.
Procedure:
1. Preparation of plasma samples:
◦ Centrifuge citrated plasma specimens at 1500 g for 15
minutes to obtain platelet-poor plasma.
◦ Aliquot the plasma into appropriately labeled tubes.
2. Load the plasma samples, calibrators, and controls onto the
coagulation analyzer.
3. Perform the test using the Chromogenix Coatest APC
Resistance V kit according to the manufacturer's instructions:
◦ Add plasma sample to the assay reagent.
◦ Incubate the reagent-plasma mixture at 37°C for the
specified duration.
◦ Measure the clotting time using the analyzer.
4. Calculate the APCR ratio:
◦ Determine the clotting time in the presence and absence of
Activated Protein C.
◦ Divide the clotting time in the presence of APC by the
clotting time in the absence of APC to obtain the APCR
ratio.
5. Quality Control:
◦ Perform quality control checks using the provided control
materials.
◦ Ensure controls are within acceptable ranges before
proceeding with patient samples.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results are automatically transmitted to the LIS (Laboratory
Information System).
• Review and verify results according to laboratory protocol.
• Immediate notification of any critical values to the ordering
physician as per laboratory policy.
• Document final results in the patient’s medical record.
Reference Intervals:
• Normal APCR ratio: Typically >1.8
• APCR ratio indicative of resistance: Typically <1.8
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run quality control samples with each batch of patient specimens.
• Document and review control results to ensure assay
performance.
• Perform correlation studies when introducing new lots of reagents
or calibrators.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to Chromogenix product insert for limitations including
potential interferences from medications, clotting factor
deficiencies, or anticoagulant therapy.
• Ensure proper specimen handling to avoid pre-analytical errors.

By following this SOP, laboratory staff will ensure the accurate and
timely analysis of APCRV in plasma. This contributes to effective
patient diagnosis and management.
