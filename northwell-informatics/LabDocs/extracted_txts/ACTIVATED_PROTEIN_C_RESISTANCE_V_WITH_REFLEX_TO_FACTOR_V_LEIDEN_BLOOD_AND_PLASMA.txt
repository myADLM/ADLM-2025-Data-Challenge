Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Activated Protein C
Resistance V (APC-R) with Reflex to Factor V Leiden, Blood and
Plasma
Purpose: To outline the procedure for analyzing activated protein C
resistance (APC-R) and, if necessary, performing a reflex test for
Factor V Leiden mutation using blood and plasma samples to
diagnose hereditary or acquired thrombophilia.
Specimen: Preferred/acceptable:
• 3 mL whole blood collected in a sodium citrate (blue top) tube.
Specimen should be mixed by gently inverting the tube 3-4 times
to ensure proper anticoagulation.
Unacceptable:
• Hemolyzed, clotted, or improperly labeled specimens.
• Specimens collected in anticoagulants other than sodium citrate.
• Specimens that are more than 4 hours old if not centrifuged and
stored at 2-8°C for up to 24 hours.
Equipment, Reagents and Supplies:
• Coagulation Analyzer (e.g., Stago, Sysmex)
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes and tips
• Sodium citrate (3.2%) blood collection tubes
• Activated Protein C Resistance (APC-R) reagent kit
• Factor V Leiden mutation detection kit (e.g., PCR-based method)
• Calibration and quality control materials
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
Procedure:
1. Sample Preparation:
• Ensure the blood specimen is properly labeled and has been
collected according to acceptable standards.
• Centrifuge the sodium citrate tube at 2000-3000g for 10-15
minutes to separate plasma from the cellular components.
• Carefully transfer the plasma into a labeled plastic tube, avoiding
the buffy coat and red cells. Plasma should be stored at 2-8°C if
not tested immediately.
1. APC-R Assay:
• Set up the coagulation analyzer following the manufacturer’s
instructions.
• Prepare the reagent kit and quality controls as per the package
insert. Ensure the reagent is mixed thoroughly before use.
• Pipette the required volume of plasma and reagents according to
the test protocol. Typically, 50-100 µL of plasma is used.
• Perform the test following the analyzer’s protocol. The analyzer
will calculate the APC-R ratio by comparing the clotting time of
plasma with and without added activated protein C.
• Document and review the APC-R result.
1. Reflex to Factor V Leiden Mutation Assay (if APC-R is
abnormal):
• For abnormal APC-R results (ratio < lower reference limit
indicative of resistance), proceed to the Factor V Leiden mutation
analysis.
• Extract DNA from the patient’s blood sample using a suitable
method such as a DNA extraction kit.
• Set up the PCR reaction following the Factor V Leiden mutation
detection kit instructions. Include appropriate positive, negative,
and internal controls.
• Amplify the DNA and analyze the PCR product using gel
electrophoresis or real-time PCR, based on the method used.
• Document and review the Factor V Leiden mutation result.
Quality Control:
• Run two levels of quality control material (normal and abnormal)
each day of testing and whenever a new reagent lot is opened.
• Ensure control results are within the acceptable ranges before
reporting patient results.
• Perform instrument maintenance and calibration as per the
manufacturer’s recommendations.
• Validate new lots of reagents by running patient sample
comparisons and recording results.
Reporting Results:
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS) for
review and verification.
• Report the APC-R results in the following format:
◦ Normal: APC-R ratio within reference range (defined by the
laboratory’s validated reference interval)
◦ Abnormal: APC-R ratio below the lower limit of the reference
range. Include a comment indicating reflex to Factor V Leiden
mutation analysis.
• Report Factor V Leiden mutation results as either:
◦ Positive: Presence of the Factor V Leiden mutation
◦ Negative: Absence of the Factor V Leiden mutation
Reference Intervals:
• Activated Protein C Resistance Ratio: Laboratory-specific
validated reference intervals should be followed.
• Factor V Leiden Mutation: Report as detected or not detected.
Method Limitations:
• Hemolyzed or clotted specimens may interfere with the results.
• Improper collection or handling may affect the accuracy of the
test.
