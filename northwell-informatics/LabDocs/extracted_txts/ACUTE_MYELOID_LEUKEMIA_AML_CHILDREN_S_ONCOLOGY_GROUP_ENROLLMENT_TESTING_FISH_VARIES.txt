Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Generating Results for
Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML), Children's Oncology Group
Enrollment Testing, FISH
1. PURPOSE
The objective of this SOP is to outline the analytical phase protocols
for the fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) testing of pediatric
Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) samples for Children's Oncology
Group (COG) enrollment.
Responsibility: The designated laboratory staff is responsible for
performing FISH analysis, ensuring accuracy and precision of results,
documenting data, and reporting findings according to this SOP.
1. SCOPE
This SOP is specific to FISH analysis applied to diagnostic pediatric
AML specimens submitted for COG enrollment testing. It includes the
handling, processing, and analysis steps required to generate high-
quality and accurate results.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STORAGE
Specimen: Peripheral blood or bone marrow aspirate is required.
Ensure samples are handled and transported under appropriate
conditions to maintain cell viability. Store specimens at 2-8°C if
immediate processing is not possible.
Acceptability Criteria: Specimens must be properly labeled with
patient identifiers. The sample must be received within 24 hours of
collection. Unacceptable specimens include those that are clotted,
hemolyzed, mislabeled, or received beyond the acceptable time
frame.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Automated FISH slide processor
• Fluorescence microscope with appropriate filters
• Thermocycler for slide denaturation (optional, if integrated with
slide processor)
• Incubators set at 37°C and 75°C
• Cytocentrifuge
Reagents:
• FISH probe sets specific to AML-associated genetic abnormalities
(e.g., MLL, CBFB, RUNX1)
• Fluorescent-labeled hybridization buffers
• Denaturation and hybridization solutions
• Post-hybridization wash buffers
Supplies:
• High-quality glass slides
• Coverslips
• Humidified hybridization chambers
1. PROCEDURE
5.1 Specimen Preparation Peripheral blood:
• Centrifuge peripheral blood at 300g for 10 minutes to obtain white
blood cells. Bone marrow aspirate:
• Dilute aspirate in PBS and centrifuge at 300g for 10 minutes.
5.2 Slide Preparation Cytospin cells onto glass slides at 1000 rpm for
5 minutes. Allow slides to air dry at room temperature for 30 minutes.
5.3 Slide Pretreatment Pre-treat slides in 0.01% Pepsin solution at
37°C for 10 minutes. Rinse in 2X SSC buffer to neutralize Pepsin
activity.
5.4 Denaturation and Hybridization Denature slides at 75°C in
denaturation solution for 5 minutes. Immediately transfer slides to
70% ethanol for 2 minutes, followed by air drying. Add 10 µL of
prepared FISH probe mix to each slide. Place slides in a humidified
hybridization chamber and incubate at 37°C for at least 16 hours.
5.5 Post-Hybridization Wash Remove coverslips and immerse slides
in post-hybridization wash buffer at 72°C for 2 minutes. Allow slides
to cool at room temperature.
5.6 Counterstaining and Mounting Apply a DAPI counterstain to the
slides. Mount slides with anti-fade mounting medium and coverslip.
5.7 Fluorescence Microscopy Analysis Utilize fluorescence
microscope to analyze slides. Ensure appropriate filter sets based on
probe fluorophores. Take images of at least 200 interphase cells.
Evaluate signal patterns and identify abnormalities. Record positive
and negative findings.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
Include known positive and negative control slides with each batch.
Document all quality control findings and any deviations from
established criteria. Implement corrective actions for any QC failures.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
Review and verify results by an experienced cytogeneticist. Generate
reports detailing specimen ID, probe set used, findings, and any
interpretive comments. Use established COG report templates.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Apply standard FISH limitations, including:
• Tissue quality
• Probe specificity and sensitivity Refer to probe package inserts for
additional limitations.

1. DOCUMENTATION
Maintain all records of performed steps, observations, and results in
the Laboratory Information System (LIS). Document any deviations
and corrective actions taken.
This protocol ensures accurate and reliable FISH testing for pediatric
AML, facilitating timely enrollment into the Children's Oncology Group
studies.
