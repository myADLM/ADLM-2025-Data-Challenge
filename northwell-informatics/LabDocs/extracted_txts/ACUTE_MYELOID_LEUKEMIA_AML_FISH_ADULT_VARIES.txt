Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Analytical Phase
for Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) in Acute
Myeloid Leukemia (AML), Adult
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the analysis of acute
myeloid leukemia (AML) using fluorescence in situ hybridization
(FISH) in adult patients. This SOP ensures accurate and reproducible
results that aid in the diagnosis and monitoring of AML.
2. DEFINITION
Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is a molecular cytogenetic
technique that uses fluorescent probes to detect specific DNA
sequences in chromosomes. FISH is employed to identify genetic
abnormalities associated with AML.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type: Bone marrow aspirate or peripheral blood
• Preferred/Acceptable: Fresh bone marrow aspirates or
peripheral blood samples collected in heparinized tubes
• Volume: Minimum of 2-3 mL
• Storage: Specimens should be kept at room temperature and
processed within 24 hours of collection
4. REAGENTS AND EQUIPMENT
• FISH probes specific for AML-associated genetic abnormalities
• Fixative solution (e.g., methanol-acetic acid)
• Denaturation and hybridization buffers
• Washing buffers
• Fluorescence microscope and image analysis software
• Appropriate control slides
5. PROCEDURE
A) Specimen Preparation
1. Slide Preparation:
◦ Prepare slides from bone marrow or peripheral blood smear
by spreading a thin layer of the specimen.
◦ Air dry the slides completely.
2. Fixation:
◦ Fix the slides by immersing them in fixative solution for 15
minutes.
◦ Air dry the fixed slides.
B) Probe Preparation and Hybridization
1. Denaturation:
◦ Dehydrate the slides by passing them through an ethanol
series (70%, 85%, and 100%) for 2 minutes each.
◦ Denature the specimen by immersing slides in a pre-
warmed denaturation buffer (70% formamide/2X SSC) at
72°C for 2 minutes.
◦ Immediately transfer the slides to cold ethanol series (70%,
85%, and 100%) to stop the denaturation process.
2. Probe Hybridization:
◦ Apply 10 µL of FISH probe mixture to the target area of the
slide.
◦ Cover with a glass coverslip and seal with rubber cement.
◦ Hybridize the slides in a humidified chamber at 37°C
overnight (14-18 hours).
C) Post-Hybridization Washes
1. Removal of Coverslips:
◦ Carefully remove the coverslip and rubber cement.
2. Washing:
◦ Wash slides in 2X SSC/0.3% NP-40 at 72°C for 2 minutes.
◦ Transfer to 2X SSC at room temperature for 2 minutes.
◦ Dehydrate the slides through a cold ethanol series (70%,
85%, and 100%).
D) Fluorescence Detection
1. Image Acquisition:
◦ Mount slides with fluorescence mounting medium and cover
with a coverslip.
◦ Examine slides using a fluorescence microscope equipped
with appropriate filter sets.
2. Analysis:
◦ Capture images of hybridized probes using image analysis
software.
◦ Score the signals according to specific genetic abnormalities
associated with AML.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Positive and Negative Controls:
◦ Include known positive and negative control samples with
every batch of specimens.
2. Signal Validation:
◦ Ensure the presence and clarity of signals using control
slides.
3. Troubleshooting:
◦ If signals are weak or absent, review and repeat
denaturation and hybridization steps.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Documentation:
◦ Record raw data and fluorescence images.
2. Interpretation:
◦ Analyze the fluorescence signals in the context of AML-
specific genetic abnormalities.
◦ Prepare an interpreted report indicating presence or
absence of specific genetic markers.
3. Verification:
◦ Results must be reviewed and verified by a qualified
technologist or supervisor.
◦ Critical results must be communicated to the requesting
physician immediately.

specimens and chemicals. Dispose of biological and chemical waste
according to institutional protocols.
