Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Acute Myeloid
Leukemia (AML) FISH Analysis in Pediatric Patients
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedures for performing Fluorescent In Situ
Hybridization (FISH) analysis for detecting genetic abnormalities
associated with Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) in pediatric patients.
This protocol ensures consistent, accurate, and reliable results.
Responsibility:
• All cytogenetic technologists performing AML FISH analysis.
• The supervising laboratory manager.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type:
• Bone marrow aspirate.
• Peripheral blood.
• Other tissues as instructed by the physician.
Specimen Handling and Stability:
• Bone Marrow Aspirate: Collect 1-2 mL in a sodium heparin tube.
Keep at room temperature and process within 24 hours.
• Peripheral Blood: Collect 5 mL in a sodium heparin tube. Keep
at room temperature and process within 24 hours.
• Other Tissues: As instructed, ensure immediate transportation to
the laboratory.
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Specimen collected in EDTA or other anticoagulants.
• Clotted specimens.
• Specimen older than 24 hours if not processed immediately.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• FISH probes specific for AML-associated genetic abnormalities
(e.g., MLL, RUNX1-RUNXT1, CBFB-MYH11).
• Hybridization and denaturation solutions.
• DAPI counterstain.
• Fluorescence microscope equipped with appropriate filter sets.
• Humidified hybridization chamber.
• Incubator set to 37°C.
• Slide warmer set to 72°C.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Slide Preparation:
1. Prepare fresh slides using bone marrow or peripheral blood
specimens. Ensure cell concentration is optimal for analysis.
2. Fix the slides using a methanol-acetic acid solution and air dry
thoroughly.
B. Hybridization:
1. Pre-treat slides with adequate postfixation in a denaturation
solution according to the manufacturer's protocol.
2. Apply 10 μL of appropriate FISH probe mixture to the
designated hybridization area on each slide.
3. Cover the hybridization area with a 22x22 mm coverslip and
seal with rubber cement.
4. Denature the probe and target DNA by placing the slide on the
slide warmer set to 72°C for 5 minutes.
5. Incubate the slides in a humidified hybridization chamber at
37°C for 16-24 hours.
C. Post-Hybridization Washes:
1. Remove coverslip gently and immerse slides in the post-
hybridization wash buffer (e.g., 2x SSC) at room temperature
for 5 minutes.
2. Immerse slides in a prewarmed (72°C) 0.4x SSC/0.3% NP-40
solution for 2 minutes.
3. Transfer slides to a room temperature 2x SSC/0.1% NP-40
solution for 1 minute.
4. Air dry slides completely in the dark to avoid photobleaching.
D. Counterstaining and Mounting:
1. Apply counterstain (DAPI) to each slide.
2. Cover with a coverslip and seal with rubber cement.
3. Store slides in the dark until analysis.
E. Microscope Analysis:
1. View slides using a fluorescence microscope equipped with
appropriate filter sets.
2. Capture representative images of at least 200 nuclei for
analysis.
3. Document findings and any notable abnormalities.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
Internal Quality Control:
• Ensure all reagents and probes are within their expiration dates
and stored appropriately.
• Perform quality control checks with known positive and negative
control slides to verify assay performance with each batch of
patient samples.
Proficiency Testing:
• Participate in proficiency testing programs to ensure inter-
laboratory consistency and accuracy.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
Review and Verification:
• Technologist to review and record results in the Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
• Supervising cytogeneticist to verify findings and approve the final
report.
Reporting:
• Results are to be reported as either Normal or Abnormal based on
the presence or absence of AML-specific genetic markers.
• Document any noted genetic abnormalities and provide a detailed
interpretation in the final report.
