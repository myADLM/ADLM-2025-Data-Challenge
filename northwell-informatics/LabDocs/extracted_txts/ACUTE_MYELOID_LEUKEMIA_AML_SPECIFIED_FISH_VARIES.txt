Standard Operating Procedure for Analytical Phase of Acute
Myeloid Leukemia (AML), Specified FISH Analysis
1. PURPOSE
This SOP provides a comprehensive protocol for performing
Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) analysis to detect specific
genetic abnormalities in cases of Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML).
The goal is to ensure accurate and reliable results that contribute to
the diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutic management of patients
with AML.
Responsibility:
The laboratory technologists are responsible for conducting the FISH
analysis, with oversight from the laboratory supervisor or designated
senior staff. All personnel must be adequately trained and
demonstrate competency in FISH procedures prior to conducting
tests independently.
2. DEFINITION
FISH (Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization) is a molecular cytogenetic
technique that uses fluorescent probes to identify specific DNA
sequences on chromosomes. It is particularly useful in detecting
genetic abnormalities associated with AML.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Fluorescence microscope
• Hybridization chamber
• Water bath or incubator
• Centrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• FISH probes specific for AML-associated genetic abnormalities
• Pre-treatment kit (if necessary)
• Fixative solution (e.g., freshly prepared methanol-acetic acid)
• Hybridization buffer
• DAPI counterstain
• Immersion oil
• Glass slides
• Coverslips
4. PROCEDURE
A) Sample Preparation:
1. Specimen Requirements:
◦ Bone marrow (preferred), peripheral blood, or other clinically
relevant specimens.
◦ Ensure samples are properly labeled with patient
identification and collection date/time.
◦ Process samples within specified time constraints to
maintain cell viability.
2. Slide Preparation:
◦ Make cytogenetic preparations (metaphase spreads or
interphase nuclei) on clean glass slides.
◦ Air-dry slides and fix them in freshly prepared fixative
solution for 10 minutes.
◦ Rinse slides in distilled water and air-dry again.
B) Hybridization:
1. Pre-Treatment: (if necessary)
◦ If using bone marrow or peripheral blood smears, follow the
manufacturer’s protocol in the pre-treatment kit to pretreat
slides.
2. Denaturation:
◦ Place prepared slides in a hybridization chamber.
◦ Denature DNA on the slides by placing them in a pre-
warmed water bath or incubator set to 72°C-75°C for 2-5
minutes (time may vary depending on the probe
manufacturer’s instructions).
3. Probe Preparation and Application:
◦ Thaw FISH probes and mix by vortexing gently.
◦ Apply the appropriate volume of probe mixture to each slide
and cover with a glass coverslip, ensuring it is free of air
bubbles.
◦ Seal the edges of the coverslip with rubber cement or
similar material to prevent evaporation.
4. Hybridization:
◦ Place slides in a hybridization chamber and incubate
overnight (12-16 hours) at 37°C.
C) Post-Hybridization:
1. Washing:
◦ Remove coverslips and immerse slides in wash buffer pre-
warmed to 45°C.
◦ Perform a series of stringent washes according to the probe
manufacturer’s instructions, typically involving various
concentrations of SSC (saline-sodium citrate) buffer.
2. Counterstaining:
◦ Counterstain slides with DAPI or an appropriate fluorescent
DNA stain.
◦ Mount slides with an anti-fade mounting medium and cover
with a clean coverslip.
D) Image Analysis:
1. Microscopy:
◦ Microscopy should be performed using a fluorescence
microscope equipped with appropriate filter sets for the
fluorescent probes and counterstains used.
◦ Examine the hybridized slides and capture images of
representative fields.
2. Scoring:
◦ Count at least 200 interphase nuclei or 20 metaphases if
available, as per laboratory policy or probe manufacturer's
instructions.
◦ Record the presence or absence of genetic abnormalities
specific for AML in a scoring sheet or using digital imaging
software.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Internal Controls:
◦ Include a known positive and negative control slide with
each batch of samples to ensure the accuracy of
hybridization and detection.
2. Procedure Validation:
◦ Validate every new lot of probes before use on patient
samples by analyzing known control samples to confirm
specificity and sensitivity.
3. Instrument Maintenance:
◦ Ensure regular maintenance and calibration of the
fluorescence microscope and other related equipment
according to manufacturer recommendations.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Interpretation:
◦ Interpret results according to the presence or absence of
signal patterns indicative of AML-specific genetic
abnormalities (e.g., t(8;21), inv(16), t(15;17), etc.).
2. Documentation:
◦ Document all findings in the Laboratory Information System
(LIS) along with the images and scoring data.
◦ Any unusual findings or indeterminate results should be
reviewed by a senior technologist or pathologist.
3. Turnaround Time:
◦ Reports should be generated and communicated to the
requesting physician within the turnaround time specified by
laboratory policy, typically within 3-7 days.
7. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the specific FISH probe manufacturer’s insert for detailed
information on probe limitations, including sensitivity and specificity
constraints.
