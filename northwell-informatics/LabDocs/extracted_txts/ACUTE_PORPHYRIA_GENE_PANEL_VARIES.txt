Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this SOP is to detail the analytical
phase procedures for generating results for the Acute Porphyria
Gene Panel. This protocol ensures accurate and reliable
identification of genetic variants associated with acute
porphyria, utilizing next-generation sequencing (NGS)
technology.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for
performing, documenting, and reporting all analytical phase
procedures outlined below. Supervisor oversight is required for
troubleshooting and validation of results.
1. DEFINITION The Acute Porphyria Gene Panel targets specific
genes associated with acute porphyria, including but not limited
to PBGD, HMBS, ALAD, UROD, and PPOX. Genetic variants in
these genes affect enzymatic function in the heme biosynthetic
pathway, leading to porphyria symptoms.
2. PROCEDURE A) Sample Preparation:
◦ Extract DNA from collected blood samples using an
appropriate extraction kit, following manufacturer’s
instructions.
◦ Quantify and assess the quality of isolated DNA using
spectrophotometry (e.g., Nanodrop) and agarose gel
electrophoresis.
◦ DNA concentration should be no less than 10 ng/µL and free
of contaminants.
B) Library Preparation: - Utilize a targeted NGS library preparation kit
specific for the Acute Porphyria Gene Panel. - Follow the
manufacturer's instructions for library enrichment, adapter ligation,
and PCR amplification. - Assess library quality and concentration
using a TapeStation or Bioanalyzer.
C) Sequencing: - Load prepared libraries onto an NGS platform (e.g.,
Illumina MiSeq or NextSeq) per instrument protocol. Ensure that
sequencing parameters are optimized for target depth and coverage.
- Perform sequencing according to the manufacturer's guidelines.
D) Data Analysis: - Process raw sequencing data using appropriate
bioinformatics pipelines. This includes but is not limited to alignment
to a reference genome, variant calling, and annotation. - Utilize
software tools and databases (e.g., GATK, ANNOVAR) for variant
analysis and interpretation. Mark clinically significant variants and
curate a report. - Cross-check identified variants with established
databases (e.g., ClinVar) and literature for validation.
E) Quality Control: - Run positive and negative control samples
alongside patient samples to ensure methodological accuracy. -
Monitor sequencing metrics, including read depth, coverage
uniformity, and error rates. Acceptable read depth for target genes
should be no less than 30x. - Document all QC results and actions
taken in the case of deviation from expected outcomes.
F) Result Reporting: - Generate a comprehensive report of identified
variants, including potential clinical significance and
recommendations for follow-up. - Verify and validate results
according to laboratory protocols. Ensure that all results are reviewed
by a clinical geneticist or pathologist. - Record validated results in the
Laboratory Information System (LIS) and report to the ordering
clinician.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ Refer to site-specific guidelines for reporting genetic test
results.
◦ Ensure that the report is clear and includes interpretation of
the genetic variants, potential clinical impact, and
recommendations for further genetic counseling or
additional testing.
2. REFERENCE INTERVALS
◦ Given that genetic analysis outcome consists of detected
variants rather than quantitative values, no standard
reference intervals are required. Instead, the clinical
significance of each variant is established according to
current scientific and clinical evidence.
3. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
◦ NGS technology may have limitations in detecting certain
variant types, such as large indels or structural variations.
Confirm limitations with supplementary testing if indicated.
◦ Refer to vendor guidelines and literature for detailed
potential limitations of the reagents used in this procedure.
4. REFERENCES:
◦ Refer to manufacturer's manual and package insert for
library preparation and NGS platform-specific instructions.
◦ Clinical guidelines and publications related to porphyria
genetics.
