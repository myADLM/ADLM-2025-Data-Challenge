Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for
ACUTE VIRAL HEPATITIS PROFILE,
SERUM
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for analyzing serum samples to generate
results for an Acute Viral Hepatitis Profile. This includes tests for
Hepatitis A, B, and C (HAV, HBV, and HCV) to diagnose or monitor
viral infections.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for conducting
this procedure.
• It is the responsibility of the supervising personnel to ensure the
procedure is being followed accurately and efficiently, and to
address any issues that arise during the analytical phase.
2. DEFINITION
Acute Viral Hepatitis Profile includes the following tests:
• Hepatitis A Virus (HAV) IgM
• Hepatitis B Surface Antigen (HBsAg)
• Hepatitis B Core IgM (HBcIgM)
• Hepatitis B Surface Antibody (anti-HBs)
• Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) Antibody
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Centrifuge (for serum separation)
• Automated Immunoassay Analyzer (e.g., ELISA, CLIA)
• Pipettes and tips
• Micropipette calibrator
Reagents:
• Specific kit reagents for HAV IgM, HBsAg, HBcIgM, anti-HBs, and
HCV Antibody tests
• Calibration and QC material for the immunoassay analyzer
Supplies:
• Serum collection tubes (red or serum separator tubes)
• Personal protective equipment (gloves, lab coat, safety goggles)
• Specimen bags
• Timer
4. PROCEDURE
4.1 Specimen Handling and Preparation
1. Specimen Requirements:
◦ Preferred specimen is serum from a red-top tube or serum
separator tube.
◦ Ensure that samples are processed, aliquoted, and stored
appropriately if there's any delay in analysis.
2. Unacceptable Specimens:
◦ Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
◦ Samples without proper identification and lab requisition
form.
◦ Specimens received in anticoagulant-treated tubes are
unacceptable.
4.2 Initial Sample Preparation
1. Centrifugation:
◦ Centrifuge the collected blood sample at 3000 rpm for 10-15
minutes to obtain serum.
◦ Aspirate the serum carefully without disturbing the cellular
layer.
2. Aliquot Preparation:
◦ If necessary, aliquot the serum into secondary tubes.
◦ Label the aliquoted tubes clearly with patient information
and test identifiers.
4.3 Assay Setup and Analysis
1. Instrument Calibration and Quality Control:
◦ Perform daily calibration of the immunoassay analyzer as
per manufacturer's instructions.
◦ Run quality control checks using provided control materials
to ensure the instrument is functioning correctly.
◦ Document calibration and QC results in the appropriate
logbook.
2. Test Procedure:
◦ Load the serum samples and necessary reagents into the
immunoassay analyzer.
◦ Program the analyzer according to the specific protocol for
HAV IgM, HBsAg, HBcIgM, anti-HBs, and HCV Antibody
tests.
◦ Start the test run and monitor the progress.
3. Result Generation:
◦ The analyzer will automatically process and generate results
for each test parameter.
◦ Review the generated results to ensure they are within
expected ranges and QC parameters.
4.4 Result Review and Documentation
1. Result Interpretation:
◦ Interpret the results based on the provided reference
intervals and clinical context.
◦ Mark any critical results for immediate reporting to the
healthcare provider.
2. Documentation:
◦ Print and/or electronically save the test results.
◦ Ensure all generated data, including QC logs and calibration
checks, are documented appropriately in the lab information
system (LIS).
3. Result Verification:
◦ The authorized technologist must verify the test results.
◦ Flag any anomalies or inconclusive results for repeat
analysis or further investigation.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
• Ensure all equipment and reagents are within their expiration
dates and stored according to manufacturer recommendations.
• Utilize internal controls for each test batch to confirm assay
reliability.
• Participate in inter-lab proficiency testing to maintain accuracy
and adherence to standards.
6. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If QC results fall outside acceptable limits, recalibrate the analyzer
and repeat the QC checks.
• Review assay performance if frequent discrepancies occur and
consult with a technical supervisor.
• If instrument malfunctions occur, follow the manufacturer's
troubleshooting guide and contact technical support if needed.
7. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS
• Follow all standard biohazard precautions while handling human
specimens.
• Wear appropriate personal protective equipment at all times in the
laboratory.
• Dispose of all used consumables and reagents according to
biohazard waste protocols.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results are to be entered into the LIS and verified for accuracy.
• Critical values must be communicated immediately to the ordering
clinician as per lab protocol.
• Ensure proper documentation of all actions and communications
regarding the reporting of critical values.
