1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this protocol is to provide a standardized and reliable
procedure for the analysis of Acyclovir in plasma samples. This
ensures accurate quantification and consistent results that are critical
for patient treatment and care.
Responsibility:
• Trained laboratory personnel are responsible for performing the
analysis according to this protocol.
• Supervisors must ensure that all procedures are followed and that
any deviations are documented and addressed.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen:
• Preferred/acceptable: Plasma obtained from blood collected in
green-top (heparin) or lavender-top (EDTA) tubes.
• Unacceptable: Hemolyzed samples, samples collected in sodium
citrate, sodium fluoride/oxalate, or any anticoagulants other than
heparin or EDTA.
• Volume: Minimum of 2 mL of plasma.
Handling and Storage:
• Samples must be centrifuged to separate plasma within 2 hours
of collection.
• Plasma samples should be stored at -20°C if not analyzed
immediately.
• Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system
equipped with UV detector.
• Automated pipettes and tips.
• Centrifuge.
• Freezer (-20°C).
Reagents:
• Acyclovir standard solutions.
• Internal standard (ISTD) (if applicable).
• HPLC grade water, acetonitrile, and methanol.
• Mobile phase buffer solution (as per method requirement).
Supplies:
• Collection tubes (heparin or EDTA).
• Microcentrifuge tubes.
• HPLC vials.
• Syringes with filters.
1. PROCEDURE
Sample Preparation:
1. Thaw the plasma samples at room temperature if frozen.
2. Vortex the sample briefly to ensure homogeneity.
3. Pipette 200 µL of the plasma sample into a microcentrifuge
tube.
4. Add 50 µL of the internal standard solution (if applicable) to the
plasma sample and mix thoroughly.
5. Add 400 µL of acetonitrile to precipitate proteins and vortex the
mixture for 30 seconds.
6. Centrifuge the sample at 14,000 rpm for 10 minutes at 4°C.
7. Transfer the supernatant to a clean HPLC vial and proceed with
the analysis.
HPLC Analysis:
1. Set up the HPLC system according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
2. Prepare the mobile phase as required by the method (e.g.,
water:acetonitrile, 80:20, v/v).
3. Equilibrate the HPLC column with the mobile phase for at least
30 minutes prior to injection.
4. Inject 20 µL of the sample supernatant into the HPLC system.
5. Run the samples with a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min and a detection
wavelength set at 254 nm.
6. Analyze the samples in a sequence that includes calibration
standards, quality control samples, and patient plasma
samples.
Calibration and Quality Control:
1. Prepare a calibration curve using Acyclovir standard solutions
at concentrations ranging from 100 to 5000 ng/mL.
2. Analyze quality control samples (low, medium, and high
concentrations) alongside patient samples to ensure accuracy
and precision.
3. DATA ANALYSIS AND REPORTING
4. Calculate the concentration of Acyclovir in the plasma samples
using the calibration curve.
5. Ensure that all quality control samples are within the acceptable
range.
6. Document the results and review them for any inconsistencies
or deviations.
7. Report the results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
8. SAMPLE INTEGRITY AND CRITICAL RESULTS
If sample integrity is in question:
• Centrifuge a small aliquot to check for contaminants or hemolysis.
• Contact a supervisor for further decision on proceeding with the
analysis.
Critical Results:
• Any results exceeding therapeutic levels must be immediately
reported to the attending physician.
• Follow standard reporting guidelines for any critical values.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform internal quality control procedures with each batch of
samples analyzed.
• Document and review all quality control and calibration data.
• Address any quality control failures according to the laboratory’s
standard procedures.
