Standard Operating Procedure for ACYLCARNITINES,
QUANTITATIVE, PLASMA
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized protocol for analyzing acylcarnitines in
plasma using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-
MS/MS). This procedure ensures accurate, reliable, and reproducible
results for clinical diagnosis.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel responsible for
conducting and analyzing acylcarnitine profiles. Specimens must be
pre-processed and properly accessioned before commencing this
analytical procedure.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for executing the
procedure as outlined. The supervisors ensure adherence to the
protocol and perform periodic reviews and updates to maintain
compliance with CLIA regulations.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• LC-MS/MS system
• Automated liquid handling system (optional)
• Centrifuge
• Freezer (-20°C or -80°C)
• Water purification system
Reagents:
• HPLC-grade water
• HPLC-grade acetonitrile
• HPLC-grade methanol
• Acylcarnitine internal standard mixture
• Calibration standards
• Quality control materials
Supplies:
• Plasma samples (EDTA or heparinized)
• 96-well plates or vials
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Centrifuge tubes
• Sample tubes
• Nitrile gloves
5. PROCEDURE
Pre-Analytical Phase:
• Ensure plasma samples are stored at -80°C until analysis.
• Thaw samples at room temperature and vortex briefly for
consistent mixing.
Preparation of Calibration Standards and Quality Control
Materials:
1. Prepare calibration standards by diluting acylcarnitine stock
solutions in HPLC-grade solvents according to manufacturer
instructions.
2. Prepare three levels of quality control materials (low, medium,
high) from independent sources.
3. Aliquot standards and quality control materials into appropriate
containers and store at -20°C or per manufacturer's
recommendations.
Sample Preparation:
1. Thaw plasma samples, calibration standards, and quality
control materials at room temperature.
2. Pipette a predetermined volume (e.g., 50 µL) of plasma sample
into a 96-well plate or appropriate vial.
3. Add an equal volume (e.g., 50 µL) of internal standard mixture
to each well/vial.
4. Vortex for 10 seconds to ensure thorough mixing.
5. Centrifuge samples at 14,000 rpm for 10 minutes to pellet any
particulate matter.
6. Carefully transfer the supernatant to a clean plate or vials for
LC-MS/MS analysis.
LC-MS/MS Analysis:
1. Program the LC-MS/MS system using the method development
guidelines that include mobile phase composition, gradient
program, flow rate, and column temperature.
2. Inject an aliquot (e.g., 5-10 µL) of prepared samples, calibration
standards, and quality control materials into the LC-MS/MS
system.
3. Ensure the mass spectrometer is tuned and calibrated
according to manufacturer’s recommendations.
4. Monitor specific acylcarnitine transitions in both MS and MS/MS
modes (multiple reaction monitoring, MRM).
Post-Analytical Phase:
1. Review chromatograms and spectra for peak identification and
integration.
2. Compare the sample results against calibration curves to
quantify the acylcarnitine concentrations.
3. Validate the results using quality control samples to ensure
method accuracy.
4. Enter the results into the laboratory information system (LIS).
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run calibration standards and quality control materials with every
batch of samples.
• Ensure all QC samples fall within the defined acceptable ranges
before validating the batch.
• Document all QC results and maintain records as per CLIA
requirements.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results are automatically transmitted to LIS and must be verified
by the technologist.
• Review raw data and calculated concentrations to ensure
accuracy before final verification.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Interferences: Strictly avoid hemolyzed or lipemic samples as they
may affect accuracy.
• Sample Integrity: Only fresh or properly stored plasma samples
should be used to prevent degradation.
9. TROUBLESHOOTING
• In the event of equipment malfunction or unexpected results, halt
analysis and implement corrective action as detailed in equipment
manuals and internal laboratory guidelines.
