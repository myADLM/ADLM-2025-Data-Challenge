Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Analytical Phase -
Acylcarnitines, Quantitative, Serum
1. PURPOSE
To establish a standardized protocol for the analysis of acylcarnitines
in serum to ensure accurate and reliable identification and
quantification.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
Laboratory technologists are responsible for performing the analytical
procedures, documenting the results, and notifying supervisors of
any deviations from established protocols. Supervisors are
responsible for reviewing and verifying the collected data and
addressing any issues identified during the analytical process.
1. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
• Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometer (LC-MS) with
electrospray ionization (ESI) source
• Analytical balance
• Centrifuge
• Micropipettes and disposable tips
• Vortex mixer
• Serum collection tubes
• Internal standard solutions (labelled acylcarnitines)
• Standard acylcarnitine mixture for calibration
• Mobile phase solvents (e.g., water, acetonitrile, formic acid)
• Nitrogen gas supply
• Sample preparation materials (e.g., extraction solvents, drying
apparatus)
1. SPECIMEN
Acceptable:
• 2-4 mL of serum collected in red-top or serum separator tubes
within 4 hours of collection
Unacceptable:
• Visible hemolysis, lipemia, icterus
• Specimens collected in anticoagulant tubes (e.g., heparin, EDTA)
• Specimens not properly labeled with collection date/time
1. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation:
1. Centrifuge the serum specimen at ≤1500 x g for 10 minutes at
4°C to separate the supernatant.
2. Transfer the serum supernatant to a clean labeled
microcentrifuge tube.
3. Add a known amount of internal standard solution to each
sample.
4. Vortex mix the samples for 30 seconds and let stand for 5
minutes.
5. Perform liquid-liquid extraction by adding the prescribed volume
of extraction solvent (e.g., methanol/water mixture), vortex for 1
minute.
6. Centrifuge the sample at 10,000 x g for 5 minutes.
7. Transfer the clear supernatant to a new microcentrifuge tube.
8. Dry the supernatant under a stream of nitrogen gas.
B. Reconstitution and Injection:
1. Reconstitute the dried extract in mobile phase (e.g.,
water:acetonitrile, 50:50) to a final volume of 100 µL.
2. Vortex mix the reconstituted sample for 30 seconds.
3. Transfer reconstituted samples to HPLC vial with insert.
C. LC-MS/MS Analysis:
1. Set up the LC-MS system with appropriate columns and mobile
phases.
2. Prepare and equilibrate the LC column with mobile phase.
3. Run calibration standards and quality control samples to
determine linearity, precision, and accuracy.
4. Inject the reconstituted serum samples into the LC-MS system.
5. Analyze the samples using the LC-MS methodology optimized
for acylcarnitine profiles with multiple reaction monitoring
(MRM).
D. Quality Control:
1. Ensure that quality control samples are included with each
batch of specimens analyzed.
2. Review the retention times, signal responses, and quantitative
results for calibration, control, and patient samples.
3. Confirm that quality control results fall within established
acceptance criteria. If not, re-calibrate the system, and
reanalyze patient samples affected.
4. CALCULATIONS AND REPORTING
A. Calculations:
1. Quantify acylcarnitine concentrations using appropriate
calibration curves developed from standards.
2. Express results in µmol/L based on extracted ion counts relative
to internal standard.
B. Reporting Results:
1. Results are automatically transmitted to the Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
2. Technologist reviews, verifies, and releases the results as per
laboratory reporting guidelines.
3. Document any observations or issues encountered during the
analysis.
4. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Provide specific reference intervals for individual acylcarnitine
species according to the laboratory’s validated data and clinical
guidelines.
1. LIMITATIONS AND INTERFERENCES
Refer to the limitations and specific interferences documented in the
method validation studies specific to the LC-MS system and
acylcarnitine standards used. Possible interferences include, but are
not limited to, isomers, ion suppression, co-eluting compounds.
