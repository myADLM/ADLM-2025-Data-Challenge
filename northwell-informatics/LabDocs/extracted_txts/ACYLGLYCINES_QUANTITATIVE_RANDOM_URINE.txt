Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Quantitative Analysis of
Urine Acylglycines
1. PURPOSE
To establish a standardized procedure for the accurate and precise
quantitation of acylglycines in random urine samples utilizing liquid
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).
1. SPECIMEN
Preferred/acceptable: - Random urine specimens collected in clean,
sterilized containers. - Specimens should be stored at 2-8°C and
analyzed within 14 days of collection.
Unacceptable: - Specimens arriving in laboratory without collection
date/time indicated on the sample container or requisition. -
Specimens collected in containers contaminated with preservatives
or other substances that may interfere with the analysis.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
◦ Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometer (LC-MS/
MS)
◦ Analytical balance
◦ Vortex mixer
◦ Centrifuge
◦ Pipettes and tips
◦ Standard acylglycine solutions
◦ Internal standard solution
◦ Acetonitrile (HPLC grade)
◦ Water (HPLC grade)
◦ Formic acid (analytical grade)
◦ Urine calibrators and quality controls
2. PROCEDURE
Sample Preparation: 1. Place the urine sample in a centrifuge tube
and centrifuge at 3000 rpm for 5 minutes. 2. Pipette 500 μL of the
centrifuged urine into a clean tube. 3. Add 50 μL of internal standard
solution to the urine sample. 4. Vortex the mixture for 30 seconds. 5.
Add 450 μL of acetonitrile to the mixture. 6. Vortex the mixture for 1
minute. 7. Centrifuge the mixture at 12000 rpm for 10 minutes. 8.
Transfer the supernatant into an autosampler vial for LC-MS/MS
analysis.
LC-MS/MS Analysis: 1. Prepare the LC-MS/MS system according to
manufacturer’s instructions, checking solvent levels, condition of
columns, etc. 2. Program the LC-MS/MS with the appropriate method
for acylglycine analysis, which includes: - Mobile phase composition
(e.g., water with 0.1% formic acid + acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid)
- Gradient elution program - Column type and dimensions - MS/MS
detection parameters including MRM transitions for target
acylglycines and internal standard 3. Calibrate the instrument using
high-purity acylglycine standards and analyze quality control samples
to ensure method accuracy and precision. 4. Inject 10 μL of
processed urine sample into the LC-MS/MS system. 5. Acquire data
and identify peaks corresponding to the acylglycines and internal
standard using the pre-programmed method.
Data Analysis: 1. Quantify acylglycine concentrations by integrating
peak areas and comparing them to calibration curves generated from
the standards. 2. Ensure the internal standard peak is within the
expected range for each sample; otherwise, repeat the sample
preparation and analysis. 3. Validate the data by checking quality
control samples to ensure they are within acceptable limits.
Reporting Results: 1. Transmit results automatically to the laboratory
information system (LIS) from the LC-MS/MS software. 2. Review
and verify results according to guidelines provided by the LIS. 3. If
sample integrity is in question (e.g., unusual chromatographic
patterns), flag the result and reanalyze the sample.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Perform quality control with each batch of samples using
both high and low concentration control materials to validate
accuracy.
◦ Verify calibration curves for linearity with each new set of
standards.
◦ Ensure instrument maintenance and calibration procedures
are up-to-date according to manufacturer specifications.
◦ If quality control results fall outside acceptable limits,
investigate and take corrective action before processing
patient samples.
2. REFERENCE INTERVALS
◦ Reference intervals for urine acylglycines are specific to
each acylglycine type and should be based on provided
literature values or established lab-specific ranges.
3. METHOD LIMITATIONS
◦ Presence of interfering substances in urine may affect the
accuracy of quantitation.
◦ Ensure the sample preparation and LC-MS/MS parameters
are strictly followed to minimize analytical errors.

◦ Manufacturer's instructions for LC-MS/MS instrumentation.

reference interval establishment.
◦ Internal laboratory validation documentation for acylglycine
assay.
