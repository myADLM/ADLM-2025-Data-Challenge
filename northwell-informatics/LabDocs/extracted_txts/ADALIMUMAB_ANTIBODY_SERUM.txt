1. PURPOSE The purpose of this protocol is to outline the
standard operating procedures for the analytical phase of
generating results for Adalimumab Antibody (Anti-Drug
Antibodies or ADA) in serum. This includes specimen
preparation, equipment and reagent requirements, the
procedural steps, quality control measures, and result reporting
to ensure accurate and timely results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY Designated laboratory staff trained and
proficient in the operation of the analytical methods described in
this protocol are responsible for conducting the assays and
documenting the results. Supervisors are responsible for
ensuring compliance with this protocol and addressing any
deviations or issues that arise during testing.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY Preferred
Specimen:
• 5 mL of serum collected in a serum separator tube (SST).
Specimen Stability:
• Serum specimens are stable at room temperature for up to 24
hours.
• Serum specimens can be stored refrigerated at 2-8°C for up to 7
days.
• For long-term storage, specimens should be frozen at -20°C or
below for up to 6 months.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens that are hemolyzed or grossly lipemic.
• Specimens stored at room temperature for more than 24 hours.
• Specimens received in inappropriate containers or with insufficient
volume.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• ELISA plate reader capable of measuring absorbance at 450 nm.
• Microplate washer.
• Calibrated micropipettes and tips.
• Centrifuge for serum separation.
• Adalimumab Antibody ELISA kit.
• Calibrators, controls, and reagents as specified by the ELISA kit
manufacturer.
• Deionized or distilled water.
1. PROCEDURE Adalimumab Antibody ELISA Assay:
2. Preparation: a. Allow all reagents, calibrators, and specimens to
reach room temperature before use. b. Mix all reagents
thoroughly by gentle inversion.
3. Sample Preparation: a. Centrifuge blood samples to obtain
serum. Transfer serum to a clean tube. b. Label tubes clearly
with patient identifiers.
4. Assay Procedure: a. Add 100 µL of Calibrators, Controls, and
Specimens to the appropriate wells in duplicate. b. Add 100 µL
of diluted conjugate reagent to each well. Mix gently by tapping
the plate. c. Incubate the plate for 1 hour at room temperature.
d. Wash the wells 4 times with wash buffer using the microplate
washer. e. Add 100 µL of substrate solution to each well.
Incubate the plate for 15-30 minutes at room temperature,
protected from light. f. Add 100 µL of stop solution to each well
to terminate the reaction. g. Read the absorbance at 450 nm
using the ELISA plate reader within 30 minutes of stopping the
reaction.
5. Calculations: a. Calculate the mean absorbance for each
calibrator, control, and specimen. b. Construct a calibration
curve using the mean absorbance values of the calibrators. c.
Determine the concentration of Adalimumab Antibody in each
specimen by interpolating the absorbance values from the
calibration curve.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run internal quality control samples (positive and negative) with
each batch of specimens to ensure assay validity.
• Acceptable control ranges must be established, and any
deviations must be addressed before reporting results.
• Participate in external proficiency testing programs as available.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS) for
review and verification.
• Results should be reported as concentration levels of
Adalimumab Antibody in µg/mL.
• Flag any critical or out-of-range results for immediate review by a
supervisor.
• Document any specimen rejections, protocol deviations, or
instrument issues in the appropriate logbooks.
