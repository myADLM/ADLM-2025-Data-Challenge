Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Analytical Phase for
Generating Results - ADALIMUMAB PANEL, INTERPRETATION
1. PURPOSE
The primary objective of this SOP is to establish standardized
procedures for the analytical phase of generating results for the
ADALIMUMAB PANEL. This includes the quantification of
Adalimumab (a therapeutic monoclonal antibody), anti-Adalimumab
antibodies, and the interpretation of these results. Establishing these
procedures ensures consistent, accurate, and reliable test results.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory technologists with appropriate training and
competency are responsible for performing the analytical procedures.
Supervisors and lab managers oversee the adherence to these
SOPs and are responsible for addressing any deficiencies that may
affect test results.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Acceptable Specimen Types:
• Serum samples collected in a serum separator tube (SST) or red-
stopper tube.
Unacceptable Specimen Types:
• Specimens in tubes containing anticoagulants (e.g., EDTA,
citrate)
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples as they may interfere with
the assay.
Specimen Stability:
• Store serum specimens at 2-8°C if analysis is within 48 hours of
collection.
• For longer storage, serum specimens should be frozen at -20°C
or lower.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Automated immunoassay analyzer (e.g., ELISA reader)
• Microcentrifuge
• Pipettes and tips
• Vortex mixer
Reagents:
• ADALIMUMAB PANEL Test Kit (including calibrators, controls,
and reagents)
• Buffer solutions (as specified in the test kit instructions)
• Quality control materials (low and high)
Supplies:
• Microplates (provided in the test kit)
• Sample tubes
• Gloves and lab coats
1. PROCEDURE
4.1 Preparing Samples and Controls
• Thaw frozen serum specimens at room temperature. Mix well
using a vortex mixer before analysis.
• Prepare quality control and calibrator samples as outlined in the
ADALIMUMAB PANEL Test Kit instructions.
4.2 Assay Protocol
• Load the required number of wells in the microplate according to
the number of samples, controls, and calibrators.
• Pipette the specified volume of calibrators, controls, and patient
serum samples into the corresponding wells.
• Add the appropriate volume of reagent (per the test kit
instructions) to each well.
• Incubate the plate at the specified temperature and duration
stated in the test kit instructions.
• Wash the microplate wells as directed to remove unbound
components.
• Add enzyme conjugate to each well and incubate as outlined.
• After the incubation period, wash the wells and add the substrate
solution.
• Stop the reaction after the specified time by adding the stop
solution.
• Measure the optical density (OD) of each well using an ELISA
reader at the wavelength specified in the test kit instructions.
4.3 Data Analysis and Calculation
• Use the analyzer’s software to construct a standard curve from
the calibrators.
• Calculate the concentration of adalimumab and anti-adalimumab
antibodies in patient samples using the standard curve.
• Ensure that all controls are within the specified ranges before
accepting the run.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run at least two levels of quality control materials with each batch
of patient samples.
• Ensure that quality control results fall within the established
acceptable range.
• Document all QC data in the appropriate logbook.
1. RESULTS INTERPRETATION AND REPORTING
• Compare patient results to the reference intervals provided in the
test kit instructions or validated by the laboratory.
• Interpret results in the context of the clinical question, patient
history, and other laboratory findings.
• Document and review all results, ensuring any critical values are
promptly communicated to the appropriate clinical team.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Acknowledge that certain interfering substances (e.g., rheumatoid
factor, heterophilic antibodies) can affect the accuracy of results.
• Refer to the ADALIMUMAB PANEL Test Kit insert for specific
reagent pad limitations and troubleshooting guidance.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Review and verify results before transmittal to the LIS (Laboratory
Information System).
• Ensure that all interpreted results are accurately and clearly
reported to the requesting physician, typically through the LIS or
as defined by site specific reporting guidelines.

Note:
Consistency in the execution of this protocol is critical to ensuring the
reliability and accuracy of results. Adhering to all steps outlined and
properly documenting each phase of analysis helps maintain
laboratory standards and supports clinical decision-making.
