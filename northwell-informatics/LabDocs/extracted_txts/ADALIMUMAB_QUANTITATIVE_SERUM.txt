Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase:
Adalimumab Quantitative, Serum
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized method for accurately measuring and
documenting serum levels of Adalimumab (Humira) for therapeutic
drug monitoring.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the assay
according to the procedure outlined in this SOP. It is the responsibility
of all laboratory staff to identify any potential issues affecting test
results and report them to the supervisor immediately.
1. DEFINITION
Adalimumab Quantitative, Serum: A laboratory test to measure the
concentration of Adalimumab in the patient's serum.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Preferred Specimen:
• Serum collected in a red top or gold top tube (SST).
Acceptable Specimen:
• Serum collected in a serum separator tube (SST).
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
• Specimens that are not adequately labeled or do not have the
collection date/time indicated.
Stability:
• Refrigerated (2-8°C): Stable for up to 48 hours.
• Frozen (-20°C or lower): Stable for up to 6 months.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• LC-MS/MS system or ELISA reader
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes
• Incubator (if using ELISA)
Reagents:
• Calibrators and controls specific to Adalimumab
• ELISA Kit with required buffers and substrates (if ELISA is used)
• LC-MS grade solvents (if LC-MS/MS is used)
Supplies:
• Disposable pipette tips
• Microcentrifuge tubes
• Sample vials
1. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
• Prepare all reagents and calibrators according to manufacturer
instructions.
• Ensure all equipment is cleaned and calibrated as per
maintenance protocols.
Sample Analysis:
• For LC-MS/MS:
1. Centrifuge the serum sample at 3,000 rpm for 10 minutes.
2. Transfer the supernatant to a clean vial.
3. Prepare a calibration curve using a set of known
concentrations of Adalimumab.
4. Inject prepared samples, controls, and calibrators into the
LC-MS/MS system.
5. Analyze data to determine the concentration of Adalimumab
in the serum.
• For ELISA:
1. Allow serum samples, calibrators, and controls to reach
room temperature.
2. Dilute samples as required.
3. Add diluted samples, calibrators, and controls to the ELISA
plate wells.
4. Incubate the plate according to kit instructions.
5. Wash the plate and add the substrate solution.
6. Read and interpret the results using an ELISA reader.
Troubleshooting:
• If controls fall outside the expected range, repeat the test.
• Review calibration curve for accuracy and re-calibrate if
necessary.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
Internal Quality Control:
• Ensure that quality control samples are run with every batch of
patient samples.
• Review control results for acceptable ranges before releasing
patient results.
External Quality Control:
• Participate in proficiency testing programs.
• Compare internal results with peer group statistics.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
Reference Intervals (example values):
• Therapeutic range: 3-7 µg/mL
• Concentrations exceeding 7 µg/mL may indicate possible adverse
effects.
• Concentrations below 3 µg/mL may suggest suboptimal
therapeutic dosing.
Documentation:
• Enter findings into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Verify results for accuracy before reporting.
• Attach a comment for any results outside expected range
detailing potential interferences or unusual findings.
Critical Result Reporting:
• Report any critical findings immediately to the clinician according
to lab protocol.
• Document the communication thoroughly.
