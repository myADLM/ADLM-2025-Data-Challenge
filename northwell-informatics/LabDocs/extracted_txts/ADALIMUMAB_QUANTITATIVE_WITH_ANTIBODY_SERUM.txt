1. PURPOSE
To provide a clear, standardized procedure for the quantitative
determination of Adalimumab (Humira) concentration and associated
antibodies in serum samples.
Responsibility:
All laboratory staff must ensure strict adherence to this procedure to
maintain the integrity of results. Laboratory scientists will be
responsible for sample processing, analysis, quality control, and
reporting results.
1. DEFINITION
Adalimumab is a monoclonal antibody used to treat autoimmune
conditions. The goal is to assess the drug levels and identify the
presence of antibodies against Adalimumab in the patient's serum.
1. PROCEDURE
Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies:
Elisa/CLIA Analyzer (e.g., Roche Cobas e411 Analyzer) Adalimumab
Serum Quantification Reagent Kits Calibrators, Controls, and
Standards for Adalimumab Serum samples Micropipettes and tips
Calibrated centrifuge Sample tubes
Specimen Requirements:
Sample Type: Serum Collection: Collect whole blood using a serum
separator tube (SST). Centrifuge: Centrifuge the blood sample at
1300-2000g for 10-15 minutes within 2 hours of collection. Storage:
Store serum at 2-8°C if analysis is performed within 72 hours. For
long-term storage, keep at -20°C or below.
Unacceptable Specimens:
Hemolyzed samples Lipemic samples Improperly stored samples
Samples with incorrect collection/labeling information
Procedure:
1. Serum Preparation:
Allow whole blood samples to clot at room temperature. Centrifuge
the clotted blood as described above. Transfer the clear serum into
appropriately labeled sample tubes. Store the serum under suitable
conditions until analysis.
1. Reagent Preparation:
Prepare reagents, calibrators, control materials, and standards
according to the manufacturer's guidelines. Ensure all reagent kits
are within their expiry dates.
1. Calibration:
Perform calibration using the provided calibrators with each run or as
specified in the manufacturer’s instructions. Document the calibration
values and ensure they are within acceptable ranges.
1. Quality Control:
Run quality control samples (low, medium, and high) with each batch
of patient samples. Document and verify QC results. The results must
fall within the specified control limits before proceeding with patient
sample analysis.
1. Sample Analysis:
Load the prepared serum samples, along with calibrators and
controls, onto the Elisa/CLIA Analyzer. Initiate the analysis run as per
the instrument’s operating protocol, specifically selecting the
Adalimumab quantification and antibody detection assays.
1. Results Interpretation:
Upon completion, review the analyzer-generated results. Verify that
all QC parameters are within acceptable ranges. For samples
showing the presence of anti-Adalimumab antibodies, further
confirmatory testing may be necessary.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
Transfer results from the analyzer to the Laboratory Information
System (LIS) for review. Ensure all results are reviewed and verified
by a qualified technologist before final release. Report the
concentration of Adalimumab in ng/mL or μg/mL, as well as the
presence or absence of antibodies.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Therapeutic ranges and cut-offs for Adalimumab depend on clinical
guidelines and may be updated periodically.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Consult the manufacturer’s insert for specific limitations of the assay.
Interference may occur due to heterophilic antibodies, lipemia,
hemolysis, or other factors affecting antibody assays.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
Adhere to defined schedules for internal and external quality control
assessments. Maintain records from quality control checks,
instrument maintenance, calibration logs, and corrective actions for
auditing purposes.
1. REFERENCES
Include the package inserts and instruction manuals for reagent kits
and analyzers. Refer to the latest clinical guidelines for Adalimumab
monitoring in relevant medical conditions. Changes in clinical
guidelines must be reviewed and incorporated into this SOP annually.
