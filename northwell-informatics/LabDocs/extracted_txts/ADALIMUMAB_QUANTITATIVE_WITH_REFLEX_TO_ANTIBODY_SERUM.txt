Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical
Phase of Adalimumab Quantitative with Reflex to
Antibody, Serum
1. PURPOSE
This SOP provides guidelines for performing adalimumab (ADA)
quantitative analysis with reflex to antibody detection in serum
samples. This ensures accuracy, precision, reproducibility, and
reliability of results.
2. SCOPE
Applies to serum samples received for adalimumab quantitative
analysis and subsequent reflex testing for anti-adalimumab
antibodies (AAA).
3. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory staff perform the analysis, document results,
and initiate reflex testing when required. Staff and supervisors ensure
compliance with this SOP, recognition of out-of-specification results,
and appropriate corrective actions.
4. DEFINITIONS
• Adalimumab (ADA): A human monoclonal antibody used for
treating autoimmune diseases.
• Anti-Adalimumab Antibodies (AAA): Antibodies generated by
patients against adalimumab, potentially reducing drug efficacy.
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Accepted Specimens: Serum collected in SST (serum separator
tube) or red-top tube.
• Unacceptable Specimens: Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric
specimens.
6. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
• Immunoassay analyzer (e.g., ELISA reader)
• Reagents for adalimumab quantitation
• Reagents for anti-adalimumab antibody detection
• Calibrators and controls
• Pipettes and tips
• Vortex mixer
• Centrifuge
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run controls and calibrators with each batch of patient samples.
• Document all control results in the QC log.
• Acceptable limits for control values should be within ±2 standard
deviations from the mean.
8. PROCEDURE
A) Adalimumab Quantitative Analysis
1. Preparation
◦ Verify sample identity and condition.
◦ Allow serum samples and reagents to reach room
temperature (20-25°C) before testing.
2. Calibration
◦ Calibrate the immunoassay analyzer as per manufacturer
instructions using provided calibrators.
3. Testing
◦ Load serum samples, controls, and calibrators onto the
immunoassay analyzer.
◦ Follow the manufacturer's protocol for adalimumab
quantitation.
◦ Document results clearly, including date, time, and the
initials of the performing technologist.
4. Quality Control
◦ Review control results. If controls are out of range, do not
report patient results until issues are resolved.
◦ Maintain records of corrective actions taken.
B) Reflex Testing for Anti-Adalimumab Antibody
1. Criteria for Reflex Testing
◦ Initiate reflex testing if adalimumab levels are below the
therapeutic range, as defined by the clinician or protocol.
2. Preparation
◦ Use the same serum sample for reflex testing.
3. Calibration
◦ Calibrate the immunoassay analyzer using AAA-specific
calibrators.
4. Testing
◦ Follow the detailed procedure for anti-adalimumab antibody
detection according to the manufacturer's instructions.
◦ Record results including date, time, and initials of the
performing technologist.
5. Quality Control
◦ Assess control results specifically for anti-adalimumab
antibody assays.
◦ Take corrective actions if controls fail and document all
actions taken.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
1. ADA Quantitation
◦ Report quantitative adalimumab levels in µg/mL.
◦ Verify and review results before releasing them.
◦ Document any repeat tests and reasons.
2. Anti-Adalimumab Antibody
◦ Report AAA results as positive or negative, along with
quantitative titers if applicable.
◦ For positive AAA results, add interpretive comments to guide
clinical actions.
◦ Document any repeat tests and reasons.
10. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Adalimumab: The therapeutic range should be defined in
consultation with the clinician.
• AAA: Negative (< Cut-off value), Positive (≥ Cut-off value)
11. SAMPLE INTEGRITY AND HANDLING
• Analyze samples immediately or store at -20°C until analysis.
• Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
• If sample integrity is compromised, note this in the patient record
and request a new sample.
12. CORRECTIVE ACTIONS FOR OUT-OF-SPECIFICATION
RESULTS
• Follow troubleshooting guidelines provided in the reagent insert.
• Recalibrate the instrument if necessary, and re-run the controls.
• If problems persist, contact technical support for the manufacturer
before reporting results.
13. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolysis, lipemia, and icterus may interfere with results.
• Following recommended procedures and troubleshooting steps
cannot completely eliminate the potential for false results.

• Manufacturer's instruction manual for the immunoassay analyzer.
• Package inserts for adalimumab quantitation and anti-
adalimumab antibody kits.
• Current laboratory quality management guidelines.
By adhering to this SOP, laboratory personnel will ensure consistent
and reliable results for ADA quantitation and reflex AAA testing,
thereby aiding in the effective management of patients receiving
adalimumab therapy.
