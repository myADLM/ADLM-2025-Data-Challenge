1. PURPOSE
This protocol outlines the procedures for the analytical phase of
generating results for ADAMTS-13 (A Disintegrin and
Metalloproteinase with Thrombospondin motif 13) evaluation using
citrate plasma. The purpose is to ensure accurate, consistent, and
reliable results for diagnosing thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura
(TTP) and other related disorders.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel and is specific to the
analytical phase of testing ADAMTS-13 activity and inhibitors in
citrate plasma specimens already collected, received, and
accessioned.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the trained laboratory personnel to follow this
SOP. Supervisors and managers must ensure adherence to these
procedures and conduct regular reviews.
4. DEFINITIONS
• ADAMTS-13: A metalloprotease enzyme critical for cleaving von
Willebrand factor (VWF). Its deficiency or inhibition is associated
with TTP.
• Citrate Plasma: Plasma separated from whole blood collected in
citrate anticoagulant tubes.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Calibrated microplate reader capable of reading at 450 nm
• Plate washer or manual wash setup
• Incubator set to 37°C
• Calibrated pipettes and pipette tips
• Vortex mixer
• Microcentrifuge
• ADAMTS-13 ELISA Kit (includes standards, controls, reagents,
and assay buffer)
• Deionized water
• Laboratory timer
6. PROCEDURE
A. Reagent Preparation
1. Reagents from the ELISA kit should be prepared according to
the manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Reconstitute standards and controls with the provided buffer
and mix gently. Allow them to sit for the recommended duration
before use.
3. Prepare working solutions of diluent, wash buffer, enzyme
conjugate, substrate, and stop solution as per instructions.
B. Sample Preparation
1. Thaw citrate plasma samples quickly at 37°C if frozen,
followed by thorough mixing. Keep on ice until ready to use.
2. Centrifuge the samples at 1,500 x g for 10 minutes to clear
any particulates.
3. Prepare sample dilutions as instructed by the ELISA kit
manufacturer.
C. Assay Procedure
1. Label wells in the microplate for standards, controls, and
samples in duplicate.
2. Add 100 µl of standards, controls, and samples to the
appropriate wells.
3. Incubate the plate at 37°C for the period specified in the kit
instructions (typically 60-90 minutes).
4. Aspirate and wash the wells three times with wash buffer.
Ensure complete removal of liquid in each step.
5. Add 100 µl of enzyme conjugate to each well.
6. Incubate again at 37°C for the period specified.
7. Repeat the wash steps as previously.
8. Add 100 µl of substrate solution to each well.
9. Incubate at room temperature, in the dark, for the specified
time (usually 10-20 minutes).
10. Add 100 µl of stop solution to each well.
11. Read the plate at 450 nm using the calibrated microplate
reader within 30 minutes.
D. Data Analysis
1. Plot the standard curve by graphing the optical density (OD)
readings of the standards against their concentrations.
2. Calculate concentrations of ADAMTS-13 in samples by
interpolation from the standard curve.
3. Review and validate results, ensuring controls fall within
expected ranges.
E. Quality Control
1. Include all levels of quality control in each run.
2. Review QC results to validate the run.
3. Document any deviations or corrective actions taken.
F. Reporting Results
1. Results are to be documented and entered into the
Laboratory Information System (LIS).
2. Any results falling outside the reference range must be flagged
and communicated to the requesting clinician promptly.
