ADAMTS13 Activity Assay, Plasma
1. PURPOSE
The ADAMTS13 Activity Assay is performed to quantify the activity
level of the ADAMTS13 enzyme in plasma. This protocol ensures the
accurate and consistent generation of results for clinical and research
purposes.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Acceptable Specimens:
• Citrated plasma: Blood collected into a 3.2% sodium citrate tube.
• Volume: A minimum of 1.0 mL plasma is required.
Specimen Collection and Handling:
• Blood should be centrifuged within 2 hours of collection at 1500 g
for 15 minutes at room temperature.
• Plasma should be carefully aliquoted into a separate tube,
avoiding the buffy coat and any cellular components.
• Plasma aliquots should be flash-frozen immediately and stored at
-80°C until analysis.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens collected in any anticoagulant other than sodium
citrate.
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Plate reader capable of measuring absorbance at specified
wavelengths.
• Microcentrifuge and centrifuge capable of accommodating 1.5 mL
tubes and blood collection tubes.
• Pipettes and pipette tips.
Reagents:
• ADAMTS13 substrate reagent (e.g., FRETS-VWF73).
• Calibration and control plasmas.
• Assay buffer.
• Stop solution (e.g., EDTA).
Supplies:
• Microplates suitable for fluorescence or absorbance reading.
• Polypropylene tubes for plasma storage.
4. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Thaw frozen plasma samples and controls at 37°C for 5
minutes. Mix gently by inversion (do not vortex).
Assay Setup: 2. Prepare assay reagents (e.g., substrate, assay
buffer) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 3. Aliquot 50 μL
of assay buffer into each well of the microplate. 4. Add 50 μL of
sample, calibration, or control plasma into designated wells. 5. Add
50 μL of ADAMTS13 substrate reagent to each well to start the
reaction.
Incubation: 6. Incubate the plate at 37°C for 30 minutes in a dark
environment to protect the fluorescent signal.
Measurement: 7. Add 100 μL of stop solution to each well to
terminate the reaction. 8. Measure the fluorescence or absorbance at
the appropriate wavelength using a plate reader as specified by the
assay kit's instructions.
5. CALCULATIONS AND INTERPRETATION
1. Generate a standard curve using the calibration plasma values.
2. Determine the ADAMTS13 activity (expressed as a percentage
of normal activity) in each sample by comparing the sample’s
absorbance or fluorescence to the standard curve.
3. Report results in accordance with site-specific reporting
guidelines.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Run quality controls (high and low) alongside patient samples
during each assay run.
2. Ensure quality control results fall within the predetermined
acceptable range. If any QC result is out of range, investigate
and resolve the issue before processing patient samples.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
2. Generate and review the final report in accordance with
laboratory reporting policies.
3. Flag and immediately report critical results or those requiring
urgent clinical attention according to the laboratory’s critical
result policy.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples may interfere with the
assay results.
• Incorrect specimen handling and storage may lead to erroneous
results.
• Ensure all reagents are used within their expiration dates and
stored per manufacturer recommendations.
