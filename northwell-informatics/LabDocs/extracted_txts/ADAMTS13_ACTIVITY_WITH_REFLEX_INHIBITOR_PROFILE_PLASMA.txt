Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for ADAMTS13 Activity
with Reflex Inhibitor Profile, Plasma
1. PURPOSE
To ensure the accurate and reliable measurement of ADAMTS13
activity in plasma samples with reflex testing for inhibitor profile as
required. This protocol describes procedures to be followed for
sample preparation, analysis, and result generation to ensure
compliance with laboratory standards.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all personnel involved in the analytical phase of
testing for ADAMTS13 activity with reflex inhibitor profile.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
Laboratory technologists are responsible for the proper execution of
procedures for ADAMTS13 activity and, if necessary, reflex inhibitor
profile testing. Supervisors are responsible for ensuring adherence to
this SOP and for providing necessary training to personnel.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Accepted Specimens:
• Plasma collected in sodium citrate tubes (3.2% or 3.8%)
• Plasma samples should be double centrifuged at 1500 x g for 15
minutes to remove platelets.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
• Samples with significant visible clots.
Storage and Stability:
• Fresh plasma analyzed within 4 hours of collection.
• If delayed processing is anticipated, plasma should be frozen at
-80°C and can remain stable for up to 6 months.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• ADAMTS13 Activity Assay Kit
• Reflex Inhibitor Profile Assay Kit (if initial test result warrants
reflex testing)
• Calibrators and Controls: Normal and deficient plasma controls
• Pipettes and tips
• Centrifuge
• Plate reader
• Laboratory timer
• Personal protective equipment
6. PROCEDURE
A) ADAMTS13 Activity Assay
1. Preparation of Reagents:
◦ Thaw and prepare all reagents, calibrators, and controls as
per the manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Sample Preparation:
◦ Thaw frozen plasma samples at 37°C in a water bath.
Ensure samples are thoroughly mixed after thawing.
3. Assay Procedure:
◦ Pipette appropriate volumes of samples, calibrators, and
controls into designated wells of the assay plate.
◦ Add the substrate and other necessary reagents as
specified in the kit insert.
◦ Incubate at the recommended temperature for the precise
time according to the protocol provided by the kit
manufacturer.
◦ Measure the optical density (OD) at the specified
wavelength using a calibrated plate reader.
4. Calculation of Results:
◦ Use the standard curve generated from calibrators to
quantify ADAMTS13 activity in samples.
◦ Express results as a percentage (%) of normal activity.
B) Reflex Inhibitor Profile (If ADAMTS13 Activity < 30%)
1. Preparation of Reagents:
◦ Thaw and prepare all inhibitors and necessary reagents as
per the manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Sample Dilution and Inhibition Testing:
◦ Dilute the patient plasma samples appropriately if indicated
by the protocol.
◦ Incubate patient plasma with inhibitor for the specified time
as indicated in the kit insert.
◦ Analyze samples using the same procedure as the initial
ADAMTS13 activity assay.
3. Interpretation of Results:
◦ Compare inhibited sample results against controls to
determine the presence and titer of any inhibitors.
◦ Interpret the findings to provide a detailed inhibitor profile.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run internal quality control samples with each assay to ensure
the accuracy and precision of the test.
• If controls fall outside the established acceptable ranges,
troubleshoot according to provided guidelines and do not release
patient results until the issue is resolved.
8. REPORTING OF RESULTS
• Enter all results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Flag and review any results with ADAMTS13 activity below 30%
for automatic reflex inhibition testing.
• Document any inhibitory activity in the patient report, including
titer values if applicable.
9. RECORD KEEPING
• Maintain logs of reagent batch numbers, calibration curves,
control results, and any deviations from standard procedure.
• Record and file all QC data for future reference and inspections.

11. REVIEW AND REVISION
This SOP should be reviewed and revised annually or as needed to
ensure compliance with updated regulations, guidelines, and
technology advancements.
