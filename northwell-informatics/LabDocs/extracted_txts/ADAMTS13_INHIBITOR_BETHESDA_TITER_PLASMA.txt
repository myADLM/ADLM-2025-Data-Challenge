Standard Operating Procedure for ADAMTS13 Inhibitor
Bethesda Titer, Plasma
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the procedures for the analytical phase of
generating results for the ADAMTS13 Inhibitor Bethesda Titer,
Plasma. This involves the precise and accurate determination
of ADAMTS13 inhibitor levels in patient plasma samples.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel trained and
authorized to perform ADAMTS13 Inhibitor Bethesda Titer
testing in a CLIA-certified laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of laboratory technologists to conduct the
assay according to this SOP and ensure the integrity and
confidentiality of test results. Supervisors are responsible for
training staff, maintaining oversight, and ensuring compliance
with this procedure.
4. DEFINITION
ADAMTS13 Inhibitor Bethesda Titer is a quantitative test used
to determine the level of antibodies that inhibit the activity of
ADAMTS13, a von Willebrand factor-cleaving protease, in
plasma.
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
a. Specimen Type: Plasma
b. Collection Tube: Sodium Citrate (light blue top) tube.
c. Volume: Minimum of 3 mL plasma.
d. Handling: First, ensure the plasma is collected by proper
venipuncture technique. Centrifuge the sample at 1500 x g for
10-15 minutes within 1 hour of collection to separate plasma.
Transfer plasma to a labelled polypropylene tube and freeze
immediately. Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
6. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
a. Microplate reader capable of reading at 405 nm.
b. Calibrated pipettes and tips.
c. Plastic tubes and reservoirs.
d. ADAMTS13 substrate and buffer solution.
e. Calibration controls and standards.
f. Positive and Negative quality control materials.
g. Incubator set to 37°C.
h. 96-well microtiter plates.
7. PROCEDURE
a. Thawing Samples: Thaw frozen plasma samples rapidly at
37°C. Mix gently by inversion to ensure homogeneity.
b. Preparation of Reagents: Prepare all necessary reagents,
including buffer solutions and ADAMTS13 substrate, as per
manufacturer’s instructions. Bring all reagents to room
temperature before use.
c. Standard and Control Preparation: Prepare a standard
curve and controls by making serial dilutions of the provided
ADAMTS13 inhibitor standard.
d. Assay Preparation:
i. Label the 96-well microtiter plate for each patient sample, control, and standard.
ii. Pipette 100 µL of prepared ADAMTS13 substrate into each well.
iii. Add 100 µL of patient plasma, control, or standard to the appropriate wells.
iv. Incubate the plate at 37°C for 60 minutes.
e. Washing: After incubation, wash the plate with buffer
solution no less than five times to remove unbound
components.
f. Detection: Add 100 µL of chromogenic substrate to each well
and incubate at room temperature for an additional 60 minutes
in the dark.
g. Measurement: Read the plate at 405 nm using a microplate
reader. Record the optical density (OD) values.
8. CALCULATIONS
a. Construct a standard curve by plotting the OD values of the
standards against their known concentrations.
b. Determine the concentration of ADAMTS13 inhibitor in the
patient samples by interpolating their OD values from the
standard curve.
9. QUALITY CONTROL
a. Run positive and negative controls with each batch of patient
samples to ensure assay performance.
b. If controls do not fall within the acceptable range,
troubleshoot and repeat the assay before proceeding to patient
results.
10. REPORTING RESULTS
a. Verify that all quality control criteria have been met.
b. Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
c. Report ADAMTS13 Inhibitor levels in Bethesda Units (BU).
d. Results must be reviewed and verified by a qualified
technologist before releasing.
11. REFERENCE INTERVALS
The normal reference interval for ADAMTS13 inhibitor in
plasma is 0 to <0.4 BU. Results ≥0.4 BU are considered
positive for the presence of inhibitors.
12. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the manufacturer’s package insert for limitations of the
assay. Potential factors that may affect test results include
improper specimen collection, handling, and storage or
interference by hemolysis, lipemia, or icterus in the specimens.
13. REFERENCES
Refer to the manufacturer’s package insert for the ADAMTS13
Inhibitor Bethesda Titer kit for detailed information on the
performance characteristics and limitations of the test.
