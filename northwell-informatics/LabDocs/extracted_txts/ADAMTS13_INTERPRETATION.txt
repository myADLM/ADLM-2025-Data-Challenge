Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Analytical Phase for
Generating Results for ADAMTS13 Interpretation
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to provide a standardized protocol for the
analytical phase of generating results for ADAMTS13 interpretation.
This ensures accurate, reliable, and reproducible results for clinical
decision-making.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory staff is responsible for
performing ADAMTS13 assays according to this procedure.
Supervisors are responsible for ensuring adherence and
troubleshooting when necessary.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen Type:
• Plasma: Collected in EDTA or citrate tubes.
Storage and Stability:
• Store plasma samples at -20°C or colder until analysis.
• Specimens are stable for up to 6 months when frozen.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens that are hemolyzed.
• Plasma samples that have been stored at room temperature for
more than 4 hours before freezing.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• ADAMTS13 Activity Assay Kit.
• Plate reader capable of measuring absorbance at appropriate
wavelengths.
• Calibrated micropipettes.
• Centrifuge.
Reagents:
• Assay reagents and standards provided with the ADAMTS13
Activity Assay Kit.
• Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).
• Distilled water.
Supplies:
• 96-well microtiter plates.
• Pipette tips.
• Tubes for sample dilution.
• Gloves and laboratory safety equipment.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation:
1. Thaw plasma samples at 4°C overnight or at room temperature
if immediate analysis is planned.
2. Mix samples gently by inversion and avoid vortexing to prevent
hemolysis.
B. Assay Preparation:
1. Prepare assay reagents according to the manufacturer's
instructions provided with the ADAMTS13 Activity Assay Kit.
2. Set up the 96-well microtiter plate, including controls and
standards to generate a standard curve.
C. Running the Assay:
1. Pipette appropriate volume of plasma sample into designated
wells.
2. Add assay reagents as specified in the kit protocol.
3. Incubate the plate according to specified times in the
manufacturer's instructions, typically at 37°C.
4. Measure absorbance using plate reader at the specified
wavelength.
D. Calculating Results:
1. Generate a standard curve based on the absorbance readings
of the standards.
2. Determine ADAMTS13 activity in plasma samples by
comparing sample absorbance readings to the standard curve.
3. Express results as percentage activity relative to a normal
pooled plasma standard.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
Material:
• Include internal quality control samples with known ADAMTS13
activity levels in each assay run.
• Use controls provided by the kit manufacturer.
Procedure:
1. Analyze quality control samples simultaneously with patient
samples.
2. Ensure control results fall within predefined acceptable ranges.
3. Record and monitor any deviations and take corrective actions
if necessary.
4. REPORTING RESULTS
5. Enter the results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
6. Review and verify results for accuracy and consistency by
comparing to control outcomes.
7. Document any discrepancies and resolve through repeat
testing if required.
Critical Results:
• Report critical values to the attending physician immediately
following standard protocol.
• Document communication and any actions taken.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
2. Refer to the manufacturer's instructions for limitations specific
to the ADAMTS13 Activity Assay.
3. Interpret results with caution if hemolysis is suspected.
4. Be aware of potential interferences from other plasma
components.

By following this SOP, the laboratory ensures high standards of
accuracy and reliability in generating ADAMTS13 interpretation
results for clinical use.
