SOP for the Analytical Phase of ADAMTS13 Profile
Interpretation
1. PURPOSE
To standardize the processing and interpretation of ADAMTS13
activity and inhibitor testing results in order to ensure accuracy and
consistency in reporting.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of trained laboratory scientists to conduct the
ADAMTS13 profile tests and to interpret and report the results.
Supervisors are responsible for ensuring compliance with this SOP
and for providing additional guidance as necessary.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred Specimen: Citrated plasma (3.2% sodium citrate)
collected in blue-top tubes.
• Volume: Minimum 1 mL of platelet-poor plasma. For accurate
results, ensure that plasma is separated within one hour of
collection and is promptly frozen at −70°C or lower if not
immediately tested.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Platelet-poor plasma specimens
• Reagents: ADAMTS13 activity assay kits, ADAMTS13 inhibitor
assay kits
• Calibration and control materials: Low and high controls specific
to ADAMTS13 assays
• Analytical instrument: Fluorescent substrate-detecting microplate
reader or equivalent
• General lab supplies: Pipettes, centrifuge, vortex mixer, etc.
5. PROCEDURE
A. Pre-analytical Checks
1. Verify specimen adequacy, including proper labeling, volume,
and integrity.
2. Document receipt of specimens and store appropriately if there
are any delays in testing.
B. ADAMTS13 Activity Assay
1. Thaw plasma samples rapidly in a 37°C water bath and keep
them on ice until testing.
2. Prepare reagents according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
3. Add an appropriate volume of sample and controls to the
microplate wells.
4. Initiate the reaction by adding the fluorescent substrate and
incubate as specified (typically at 37°C).
5. Measure the fluorescence intensity at the appropriate
wavelength using the microplate reader.
6. Calculate ADAMTS13 activity using the standard curve
generated from control measurements.
C. ADAMTS13 Inhibitor Assay
1. If the ADAMTS13 activity is significantly low (<30%), proceed
with the inhibitor assay.
2. Mix patient plasma with an equal volume of normal pooled
plasma.
3. Repeat the ADAMTS13 activity assay as detailed above.
4. Compare the activity in the mixed sample to the normal pool
control to determine the presence of an inhibitor.
D. Quality Control
1. Run internal quality control samples (low and high controls) with
every batch of tests.
2. Accept results only if control results are within the
predetermined acceptable range.
3. Document all quality control findings and any corrective actions
taken if controls do not meet criteria.
E. Calculation and Validation of Results
1. Use software associated with the microplate reader to calculate
activity percentages.
2. Review results against established reference ranges:
◦ Normal ADAMTS13 activity: 40-130%
◦ Suspicion of TTP: ADAMTS13 activity <10%
3. Evaluate the inhibitor presence by calculating the residual
activity and comparing it to thresholds indicating an inhibitory
presence.
F. Reporting Results
1. Transfer results to the Laboratory Information System (LIS) for
review.
2. Include the following in the report:
◦ ADAMTS13 activity (% of normal)
◦ Presence or absence of an inhibitor
◦ Comments on result interpretation based on clinical
correlation
3. Use standardized comments such as:
◦ “Normal ADAMTS13 activity, no indication of TTP.”
◦ “Reduced ADAMTS13 activity; inhibitor presence
confirmed.”
G. Post-analytical Storage
1. Store residual samples at −80°C for future reference or until
repeat testing is not required.
2. Archive the records, including raw data and analysis reports,
according to laboratory policy.
6. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the manufacturer’s instructions for potential interferences
and assay limitations, such as hemolysis, lipemia, or icterus in
specimens affecting the results.
7. REFERENCES
Consult product inserts and technical manuals for the ADAMTS13
activity and inhibitor assay kits used.
8. REVIEW AND UPDATES
This procedure shall be reviewed annually and updated as needed to
incorporate new guidelines or technologies.
END OF SOP
Note: Technologists and laboratory scientists should be fully trained
on this protocol and adhere to CLIA regulations and standards at all
times.
