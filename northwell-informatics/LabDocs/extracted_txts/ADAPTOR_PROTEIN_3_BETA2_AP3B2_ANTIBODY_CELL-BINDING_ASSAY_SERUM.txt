Standard Operating Procedure - AP3B2 Antibody Cell-Binding
Assay (Serum)
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the procedure for performing and generating
results for the AP3B2 Antibody Cell-Binding Assay on serum
specimens. The assay identifies the presence and quantifies the
levels of ADAPTOR PROTEIN 3 BETA2 (AP3B2) antibodies in
patient serum samples. This test is critical for diagnosing certain
immune-related conditions.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
Laboratory personnel are responsible for following this SOP to
ensure accurate and reliable results. It is also the responsibility of the
supervising staff to ensure that all personnel are trained and that all
procedures are correctly followed.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Acceptable Specimens:
• Type: Serum
• Volume: Minimum 1 mL
• Stability: Specimens should be tested within 48 hours of
collection. If testing must be delayed, store specimens at -20°C.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens received in the laboratory more than 48 hours post-
collection without freezing.
• Specimens that are hemolyzed, lipemic, or contaminated.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Cell culture plates (96-well)
• Pipettes and tips
• AP3B2 antibody standards and controls
• Blood serum separator tube
• Cell culture medium
• AP3B2 antigen-coated cells
• Washing buffer (PBS)
• Detection reagent (secondary antibody conjugated to enzyme or
fluorophore)
• Plate reader (ELISA or fluorescence)
• Timer
• Incubator set at 37°C
5. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Prepare cell culture plates by seeding AP3B2 antigen-coated
cells into each well as per the plate layout provided in the assay
kit instructions.
2. Allow cells to adhere, grow and reach the necessary confluency
in the incubator (usually 24 hours at 37°C).
Assay Procedure:
1. Specimen Handling.
◦ Thaw serum specimens if previously frozen.
◦ Centrifuge serum samples at 2000-3000 x g for 10 minutes
if unclarified.
2. Incubation with Cells.
◦ Add 100 μL of serum samples, standards, and controls to
respective wells containing the AP3B2 antigen-coated cells.
◦ Incubate plates for 1 hour at 37°C to allow binding of
antibodies.
3. Washing Steps.
◦ Remove serum, standards, and controls from the wells.
◦ Wash wells three times with 200 μL of PBS to remove
unbound material.
4. Detection.
◦ Add 100 μL of secondary detection antibody conjugated to
enzyme/fluorophore to each well.
◦ Incubate at room temperature for 1 hour.
◦ Remove the detection antibody preparation and wash plates
three times with PBS as before.
5. Reading Results.
◦ Add substrate for enzyme-based detection or measure
fluorescence directly if a fluorescent detection reagent is
used.
◦ For enzyme-based assays, incubate with substrate until
desired signal is achieved, then stop reaction by adding stop
solution as indicated.
◦ Measure results using a microplate reader set to the
appropriate wavelength (enzyme-based detection: ~450nm;
fluorescence: specific excitation/emission based on
fluorophore).
6. QUALITY CONTROL
Controls:
• Include positive and negative controls within each assay.
• Positive control should show binding to AP3B2 antigens.
• Negative control should show minimal to no binding.
Calibration:
• Perform calibration using AP3B2 antibody standards by plotting
calibration curves for quantification.
• Plate reader settings should be checked and calibrated prior to
each run.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
Results are reviewed and interpreted based on the calibration curve
obtained from standards.
• Negative: No significant binding above the negative control
values.
• Positive: Binding higher than positive control and above a
predetermined threshold.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolyzed or lipemic samples may interfere with the assay and
result in erroneous readings.
• Strict adherence to washing steps and incubation times is
required for accurate binding measurements.
