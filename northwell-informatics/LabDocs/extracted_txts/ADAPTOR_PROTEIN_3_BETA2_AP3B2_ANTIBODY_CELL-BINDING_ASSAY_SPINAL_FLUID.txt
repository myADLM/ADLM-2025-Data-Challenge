Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Title: Analytical Phase
Procedure for Generating Results for ADAPTOR PROTEIN 3
BETA2 (AP3B2) ANTIBODY, CELL-BINDING ASSAY, SPINAL
FLUID
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for generating results for AP3B2 Antibody,
Cell-Binding Assay, in Spinal Fluid specimens, ensuring accuracy,
reliability, and consistency in the analytical phase of testing.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
All laboratory personnel involved in performing the AP3B2 Antibody,
Cell-Binding Assay are responsible for following this SOP. The
supervisor is responsible for ensuring compliance and providing
additional training as necessary.
3. DEFINITIONS
AP3B2 Antibody: Antibody directed against Adaptor Protein 3 Beta2.
Cell-Binding Assay: A method of detecting antibodies that bind to
specific cells in a sample.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen Type: Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Volume: Minimum of 1
mL Storage: Spinal fluid specimens should be stored at 2-8°C until
analysis. Stability: CSF samples are stable up to 72 hours when
stored at 2-8°C.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens arriving in the laboratory more than 72 hours after
collection.
• Specimens with no collection date/time indicated on the sample
container or requisition.
• Specimens that are visibly contaminated or contain clots.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Incubator (37°C ± 2°C)
• Cell culture hood
• Centrifuge
• Microscope
• Pipettes (calibrated)
• Refrigerator/Freezer
Reagents:
• AP3B2-positive and AP3B2-negative control spinal fluid
• Cell culture medium
• Fluorescent-labeled secondary antibody specific to AP3B2
Supplies:
• Cell culture plates
• Culture flasks
• Sterile pipette tips
• Labware (tubes, slides, and coverslips)
6. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Confirm the specimen meets acceptance criteria and has been
properly stored.
2. Warm the cell culture medium to room temperature.
3. Thaw and prepare control fluids as necessary.
Sample Processing:
1. Aliquot 100 µL of CSF into a sterile tube.
2. Add 100 µL of cell culture medium to the CSF aliquot and mix
gently.
3. Plate the mixture in a cell culture plate and incubate at 37°C for
1 hour.
Cell-Binding Assay:
1. Wash the cultured cells three times with cell culture medium to
remove unbound antibodies.
2. Add the fluorescent-labeled secondary antibody to the cells
according to the manufacturer's instructions.
3. Incubate the cells with the secondary antibody for 30 minutes at
room temperature in the dark.
4. Wash cells four times with cell culture medium to remove
excess secondary antibody.
Detection and Analysis:
1. Examine the cells under a fluorescence microscope.
2. Identify and quantify bound AP3B2 antibodies by comparing
fluorescence intensity to control samples.
3. Record observations and interpret results according to pre-
established criteria.
Quality Control:
1. Include both positive and negative controls in each batch of
testing.
2. Ensure all equipment is calibrated and within service dates.
3. Document all steps, timepoints, and any deviations from the
protocol.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
Documentation:
1. Record all observations in the laboratory information system
(LIS).
2. Ensure proper labeling and documentation of sample results.
3. Include relevant comments for any abnormal findings or
deviations.
Verification:
1. Review and verify the results for accuracy before releasing.
2. Contact the supervisor if results fall outside expected ranges or
if there are any issues with specimen integrity.
