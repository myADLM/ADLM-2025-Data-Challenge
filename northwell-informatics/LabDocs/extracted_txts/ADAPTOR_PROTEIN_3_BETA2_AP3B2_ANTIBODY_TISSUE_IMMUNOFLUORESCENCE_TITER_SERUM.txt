1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this protocol is to provide a standardized procedure
for the analysis of ADAPTOR PROTEIN 3 BETA2 (AP3B2)
ANTIBODY, TISSUE IMMUNOFLUORESCENCE TITER, SERUM,
ensuring accurate and reliable results.
2. DEFINITION
AP3B2 antibody is an important marker detected through tissue
immunofluorescence assays to determine autoantibody presence in
patient serum samples. This protocol outlines the steps required to
prepare, analyze, and document the results obtained from these
assays.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of designated laboratory technologists to
perform and document all steps involved in the analysis of AP3B2
antibody assays according to this procedure. Supervisors are
responsible for overseeing the process and ensuring compliance with
standard operating procedures.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/acceptable:
- 5 mL of serum collected in a red or yellow-top tube (SST).
Unacceptable:
- Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric specimens.
- Specimens arriving in the laboratory without proper labeling.
- Specimens arriving more than 24 hours post-collection without refrigeration.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
- Microscope equipped for immunofluorescence
- Glass slides coated with appropriate tissue sections
- AP3B2 primary antibody reagent
- Fluorescent secondary antibody reagent specific to AP3B2
- Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) as wash buffer
- Mounting medium
- Coverslips
- Positive and negative control sera
- Timer
6. PROCEDURE
1. **Preparation of Slides:**
a. Section tissue specimens onto glass slides and dry at room temperature.
b. Fix tissue sections using appropriate fixation protocol (e.g., acetone fix for 10 minutes).
c. Rinse slides in PBS to remove fixative.
2. **Incubation with Primary AP3B2 Antibody:**
a. Dilute AP3B2 primary antibody to appropriate concentration as determined by manufacturer guidelines.
b. Apply diluted primary antibody to tissue sections on slide and incubate in a humidified chamber for 60 minutes at room temperature.
3. **Washing Slides:**
a. Rinse slides in PBS 3 times for 5 minutes each to remove unbound antibody.
4. **Incubation with Secondary Antibody:**
a. Dilute fluorescent secondary antibody according to manufacturer directions.
b. Apply secondary antibody to tissue sections and incubate in a humidified chamber for 30 minutes at room temperature.
5. **Washing Slides:**
a. Rinse slides in PBS 3 times for 5 minutes each to remove unbound secondary antibody.
6. **Application of Mounting Medium and Coverslips:**
a. Apply a suitable mounting medium to slides followed by coverslips.
b. Ensure no air bubbles are trapped.
7. **Immunofluorescence Microscopy:**
a. Examine slides under a fluorescence microscope to determine immunofluorescent staining patterns.
b. Compare staining of test serum with positive and negative controls.
7. RESULT DOCUMENTATION
- Record the presence or absence of immunofluorescent staining.
- Semi-quantitative titer analysis: Report the highest dilution of serum showing clear staining of AP3B2.
- Include the date, time, and initials of the technologist performing the analysis.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
- Positive and negative control sera must be included in each run to ensure assay validity.
- Document control results along with patient results.
- Any deviation from expected control results should be investigated, and analysis repeated if necessary.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
Refer to site-specific reporting guidelines. All results must be
reviewed and verified by a technologist prior to transmission to the
laboratory information system (LIS).
10. REFERENCES
Manufacturer instructions for AP3B2 antibody reagents should be
followed. Applicable peer-reviewed scientific literature and guidelines
should also be consulted for detailed methodologies and
interpretation criteria.
This protocol ensures consistency and reliability in the analysis of
AP3B2 antibody presence using tissue immunofluorescence assays,
permitting accurate result generation for clinical evaluation.
