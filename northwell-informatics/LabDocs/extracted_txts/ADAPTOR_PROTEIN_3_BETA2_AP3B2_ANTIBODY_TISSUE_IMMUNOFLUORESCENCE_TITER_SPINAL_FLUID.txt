Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for ADAPTOR PROTEIN 3
BETA2 (AP3B2) ANTIBODY, TISSUE IMMUNOFLUORESCENCE
TITER, SPINAL FLUID
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedures for the analytical phase of generating
results for AP3B2 ANTIBODY, TISSUE IMMUNOFLUORESCENCE
TITER in spinal fluid, ensuring accuracy and reliability of testing
results.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the
tissue immunofluorescence titer analysis following this SOP.
• Supervisors are responsible for verifying and ensuring that all
procedures are adhered to, and corrective actions are taken when
necessary.
1. SPECIMEN
Specimen type:
• Spinal Fluid (CSF)
Specimen collection:
• Ensure the CSF sample is collected according to standard
medical procedures and handled aseptically.
• Collect CSF directly into sterile collection tubes.
Specimen transport:
• Transport specimen immediately to the laboratory at room
temperature or refrigerated at 2-8 °C.
• Do not freeze the CSF sample.
Specimen criteria:
• CSF samples should be clear and free of blood contamination.
Hemolyzed, clotted, or visibly contaminated samples are
unacceptable and must be rejected.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Fluorescence microscope
• Centrifuge
• Refrigerator (2-8 °C)
• Humidity-controlled chamber (optional)
Reagents:
• Specific primary antibody against AP3B2
• Fluorescently-labeled secondary antibody
• Blocking buffer (e.g., BSA or gelatin)
• Washing buffer (e.g., PBS)
• Mounting medium
• Control slides (positive and negative)
• Cytospin slides or coated slides
Supplies:
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Conical tubes
• Filter paper
• Coverslips
• Glass slides
1. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
• Thaw reagents if frozen and prepare fresh solutions as needed.
• Ensure all glass slides are clean and appropriately labeled.
Sample preparation:
• Centrifuge the CSF sample at low speed (500-1000 rpm) to
collect cells if necessary.
Applying samples:
• Pipette a suitable volume (5-10 µL) of CSF onto coated slides.
• Allow CSF to air dry or use a cytospin to transfer cells to the
slides.
Blocking:
• Apply blocking buffer to the slide to prevent non-specific binding
of the antibodies.
• Incubate the slide for 30 minutes at room temperature or as
specified by the reagent protocol.
Primary antibody incubation:
• Dilute the primary AP3B2 antibody according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
• Apply the primary antibody to the slide and incubate for 1 hour at
room temperature or overnight at 4 °C for enhanced sensitivity.
• Wash slide with washing buffer (PBS) 3 times for 5 minutes each.
Secondary antibody incubation:
• Dilute the fluorescently-labeled secondary antibody according to
the manufacturer's instructions.
• Apply the secondary antibody to the slide and incubate for 30
minutes at room temperature in the dark.
• Wash slide with washing buffer (PBS) 3 times for 5 minutes each.
Mounting:
• Apply mounting medium to the slide and cover with a coverslip.
• Dry the slide in a humidity-controlled chamber if necessary.
Microscopy:
• Examine the slides under a fluorescence microscope.
• Assess and record the fluorescence intensity and titer rank.
Quality control:
• Include positive and negative controls on each run to ensure the
specificity and sensitivity of the antibodies used.
• Record control results and verify against expected control
performance.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
Results interpretation:
• Report positive results for AP3B2 antibody with fluorescence
intensity and titration levels.
• Negative results should be clear or show minimal background
fluorescence.
Documentation:
• Record all patient results, control performance, date, time, initials
of performing technologist in the laboratory log.
• Verify results with the laboratory supervisor before reporting to the
clinician or entering into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
