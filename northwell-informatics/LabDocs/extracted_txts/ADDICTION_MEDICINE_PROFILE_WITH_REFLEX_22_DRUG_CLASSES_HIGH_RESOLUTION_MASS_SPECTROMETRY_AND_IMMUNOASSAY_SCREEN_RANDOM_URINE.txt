Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for
Analytical Phase of Generating Results for
"Addiction Medicine Profile with Reflex, 22
Drug Classes, High Resolution Mass
Spectrometry (HRMS) and Immunoassay
Screen, Random, Urine"
1. PURPOSE
This procedure outlines the analytical steps for conducting the
"Addiction Medicine Profile with Reflex, 22 Drug Classes, High
Resolution Mass Spectrometry (HRMS), and Immunoassay Screen"
on urine samples. The procedure includes initial immunoassay
screening followed by HRMS confirmation and quantitative analysis
where necessary.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for:
• Performing the initial immunoassay screening.
• Conducting HRMS confirmation and quantitative analysis on
samples that test positive in the screening.
• Ensuring accuracy and reliability of the test results.
• Documenting all steps taken in the analysis.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen Collection:
• Preferred: Random urine sample collected in a clean, dry
container. Preferably 30-45 mL of urine.
Specimen Stability:
• Refrigerated at 2-8°C for up to 7 days.
• Frozen at -20°C for long-term storage up to 1 month.
• Thaw frozen specimens completely and mix well before analysis.
4. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Immunoassay Analyzer: for initial screening.
• High Resolution Mass Spectrometer (HRMS): for confirmation
and quantification.
• Urine Control Levels: for quality control (QC).
• Calibrators and Standards: for HRMS.
• Data Analysis Software: for processing mass spectrometry data.
5. PROCEDURE
A. Initial Immunoassay Screening:
1. Preparation:
◦ Ensure the immunoassay analyzer is calibrated and quality
control is within limits.
◦ Prepare the urine specimens, controls, and calibrators
according to the analyzer's requirements.
2. Analysis:
◦ Load the urine specimens into the immunoassay analyzer.
◦ Follow the manufacturer's instructions to conduct the
screening for the panel of 22 drug classes.
3. Result Documentation:
◦ Record the screening results. Any specimen with a positive
result for one or more drug classes should be flagged for
reflex testing by HRMS.
4. Quality Control:
◦ Include negative and positive controls with each batch of
tests to ensure the accuracy of the immunoassay results.
Document the QC results.
B. High Resolution Mass Spectrometry (HRMS) Confirmation
and Quantitative Analysis:
1. Preparation:
◦ Set up the HRMS instrument according to the
manufacturer’s guidelines.
◦ Prepare calibration standards, quality control samples, and
urine specimens requiring confirmation.
2. Calibration:
◦ Calibrate the HRMS using the prepared standards to ensure
accurate quantitation.
3. Analysis:
◦ Inject urine samples into the HRMS for analysis.
◦ Utilize appropriate chromatographic separation techniques
prior to mass spectrometric detection.
◦ Analyze the data with the corresponding software,
identifying and quantifying the drugs present based on their
unique mass-to-charge ratios and retention times.
4. Result Documentation:
◦ Record the results of the confirmation tests.
◦ Integrate the data into the laboratory information system
(LIS) for result reporting.
◦ For samples with drug concentrations above the established
cutoff levels, report the quantitative values.
5. Quality Control:
◦ Analyze QC samples with each batch. Document QC results
and ensure they meet the established criteria. If QC fails, re-
evaluate and, if necessary, re-run the affected analyses.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
• Immunoassay Results:
◦ Report the initial screen results as preliminary. Positive results
will undergo further testing.
• HRMS Confirmation Results:
◦ Report confirmed positive results along with the quantitative
data.
◦ Provide a comprehensive report that includes both screening
and confirmation results.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Regularly validate the performance of the immunoassay analyzer
and HRMS by running control samples.
• Calibrate instruments as required based on manufacturer’s
instructions and internal SOPs.
• Monitor quality indicators and process control charts to ensure
analytical performance remains within acceptable limits.

• Manufacturer’s instruction manuals for immunoassay analyzer
and HRMS.
• Internal laboratory quality manuals.
• Current clinical laboratory standards as per CLIA regulations.
