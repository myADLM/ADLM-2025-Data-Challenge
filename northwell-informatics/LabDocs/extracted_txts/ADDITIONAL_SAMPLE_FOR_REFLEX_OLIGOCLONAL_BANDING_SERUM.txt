Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Generating Results for
Additional Sample for Reflex Oligoclonal Banding, Serum
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the procedure for analyzing serum samples for
reflex oligoclonal banding, ensuring consistent and accurate results.
This includes specimen preparation, analysis, documentation, and
reporting of results.
2. SCOPE
This procedure is applicable to all laboratory personnel who are
responsible for performing serum oligoclonal banding analysis.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all laboratory personnel involved in the
analytical phase to adhere to this SOP. Supervisors must ensure that
all staff are adequately trained and competent in performing these
procedures.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Serum
• Collection: Serum should be collected in a red-top tube without
anticoagulants.
• Volume: Minimum 5 mL of serum.
• Storage: Store serum refrigerated at 2-8°C if not analyzed
immediately. For long-term storage, freeze aliquots at -20°C or
lower.
• Transport: Serum samples should be transported to the laboratory
in a timely manner to preserve integrity.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Gel electrophoresis apparatus
• Power supply
• Staining and destaining solutions
• Gel documentation system
• Micropipettes and tips
• Applicator strips
• Control serum samples (positive and negative controls)
• Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)
• Sample tubes
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
6. PROCEDURE
6.1 Preparation
1. Wear appropriate PPE including lab coat, gloves, and eye
protection.
2. Thaw frozen serum samples at room temperature.
3. Prepare gel electrophoresis apparatus according to
manufacturer’s instructions.
4. Prepare all reagents and solutions needed for electrophoresis
and staining.
6.2 Sample and Control Loading
1. Label all samples and control tubes clearly.
2. Pipette the required volume (typically 10 μL) of serum sample
and controls onto the applicator strip.
3. Load the applicator strips onto the gel bed according to the
electrophoresis system’s instructions.
6.3 Electrophoresis
1. Fill the electrophoresis chamber with the appropriate running
buffer.
2. Insert the gel into the electrophoresis chamber.
3. Place the loaded applicator strips on the gel.
4. Set the electrophoresis power supply to the recommended
voltage and run time for analyzing oligoclonal bands (e.g., 100
volts for 1.5 hours).
6.4 Staining and Destaining
1. After electrophoresis, carefully remove the gel from the
apparatus.
2. Immerse the gel in the staining solution and allow it to stain for
the recommended time (e.g., 60 minutes).
3. Gently shake the gel in the destaining solution until the
background is clear and oligoclonal bands are visible.
4. Rinse the gel with distilled water to stop the destaining process.
6.5 Documentation and Analysis
1. Place the gel on the gel documentation system.
2. Capture an image of the stained gel for documentation.
3. Analyze the gel image for the presence or absence of
oligoclonal bands using criteria specified in the laboratory’s
guidelines.
4. Record all observations and interpretations clearly.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run positive and negative controls with each batch of patient
samples to ensure assay validity.
• Ensure the electrophoresis apparatus is regularly maintained and
calibrated.
• Document any deviations from the prescribed procedure and their
potential impact on results.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
2. Include detailed notes on the presence, number, and pattern of
oligoclonal bands observed.
3. Verify the results with a secondary reviewer if required by
laboratory policy.
4. Communicate critical findings to the appropriate healthcare
provider promptly.

interpretation.
10. DOCUMENTATION
• Maintain records of all samples, controls, and results according to
laboratory policy.
• Document and date all observations, any issues encountered,
and corrective actions taken in the laboratory logbook.
