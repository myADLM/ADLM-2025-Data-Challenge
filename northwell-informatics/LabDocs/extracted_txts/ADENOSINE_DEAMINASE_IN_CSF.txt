Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analysis of Adenosine
Deaminase (ADA) in Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF)
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to provide standardized procedures for
the measurement of Adenosine Deaminase (ADA) activity in
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) specimens. Accurate measurement of ADA
in CSF is crucial for diagnostic and clinical management, particularly
in the diagnosis of tuberculous meningitis.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
Laboratory personnel are responsible for the correct collection,
handling, storage, and analysis of the CSF samples. It is the
responsibility of staff to ensure protocol adherence to maintain the
integrity of the results. Supervisors shall ensure that all staff are
trained and compliant with this SOP.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen:
• CSF obtained by lumbar puncture
• Minimum volume required: 1 mL
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens received that are not properly labeled, contaminated,
or with insufficient volume will be rejected.
• Any CSF specimens with visible blood contamination should be
carefully evaluated as high contamination may affect ADA activity
results.
Specimen Handling and Storage:
• Store specimen at 2-8°C if analysis can be performed within 24
hours.
• For delayed analysis beyond 24 hours, store at -20°C or lower.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Micropipettes and tips
• Spectrophotometer
• Centrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• ADA assay kit
Reagents and Supplies:
• ADA assay kit (commercially available kits such as Diazyme ADA
Assay Kit or similar)
• Calibrators and controls (provided by the assay kit)
• Clean plastic tubes for specimen and reaction use
• Deionized water
Storage of Reagents:
• Store all reagents according to manufacturer instructions, usually
at 2-8°C.
• Reconstituted reagents should be used immediately or stored
under conditions specified by the manufacturer.
1. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
• Allow reagents and CSF specimens to come to room temperature
(20-25°C) before analysis.
• Mix all reagents thoroughly before use.
Calibration and Quality Control:
• Calibrate the spectrophotometer as per manufacturer's
instructions.
• Run quality control specimens (QC) to ensure assay reliability.
Use both a high-level and a low-level QC from the ADA assay kit.
• Document all QC results and ensure they fall within acceptable
ranges before proceeding with patient sample analysis.
Assay Protocol:
1. Label tubes for standards, controls, and patient specimens.
2. Pipette the required volume of assay buffer, ADA substrate, and
CSF sample into the corresponding reaction tubes according to
the ADA assay kit instructions.
3. Vortex mix each tube briefly to ensure proper mixing.
4. Incubate the reaction mixture at a specified temperature and for
the time as per the kit instructions (typically 37°C for 30-60
minutes).
5. Stop the reaction by adding the stop solution provided with the
kit.
6. Measure the absorbance of each reaction mixture at the
specified wavelength using a spectrophotometer.
Calculation and Reporting:
• Using the standard curve generated from the calibrators, calculate
ADA activity in the CSF samples.
• Express the results as U/L (units per liter) or as indicated by the
assay kit.
• Verify that the results for QC specimens are within the acceptable
range before approving patient results.
Interferences and Limitations:
• Hemolysis, red blood cells, and elevated bilirubin may interfere
with the ADA activity measurement.
• Extreme pH or chemical contamination can also impact the
accuracy of the results.
• Ensure the use of compatible and fresh reagents for each
analysis.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
Reference Intervals:
• The reference interval for ADA in CSF is typically <10 U/L.
However, consult specific literature or clinical guidelines for lab-
established reference ranges.
Critical Values:
• ADA activity in CSF significantly higher than the reference range
may indicate infection such as tuberculous meningitis and should
be reported immediately to the clinician.
Documentation:
• Results should be documented and verified in the Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
• Any deviations or anomalies during the test must be noted.
1. QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE
• Ensure bi-weekly or monthly calibration and maintenance of the
spectrophotometer as per lab standards.
• Regularly participate in external proficiency testing programs for
ADA to maintain inter-lab reliability and certification compliance.
• Maintain thorough records of QC results, maintenance logs, and
any troubleshooting activities performed.
1. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS
• Follow standard laboratory safety protocols, such as wearing lab
coats, gloves, and protective eyewear.
• Handle all biological specimens as potentially infectious materials.
• Dispose of all waste, including used reagents and biological
materials, according to biohazard waste disposal regulations.
