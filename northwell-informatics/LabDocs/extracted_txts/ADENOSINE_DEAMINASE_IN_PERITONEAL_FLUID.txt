PROTOCOL FOR ADENOSINE DEAMINASE IN PERITONEAL
FLUID TESTING
1. PURPOSE
To outline the steps required for the accurate and precise
measurement of adenosine deaminase (ADA) activity in peritoneal
fluid samples in a clinical laboratory setting. This procedure ensures
the integrity and reliability of the results for diagnostic purposes.
1. SCOPE
This protocol applies to all clinical laboratory personnel trained in the
measurement of ADA activity in peritoneal fluid using
spectrophotometric or other relevant methodologies.
1. RESPONSIBILITIES
• Trained laboratory technologists are responsible for performing
the ADA assay according to this protocol.
• It is the responsibility of the laboratory supervisor to ensure that
all technologists are adequately trained and competent in this
procedure.
• All staff must adhere to quality control and safety guidelines to
maintain the accuracy and reliability of test results.
1. DEFINITIONS
Adenosine Deaminase (ADA): An enzyme that catalyzes the
deamination of adenosine to inosine and is used as a marker for
differentiating tuberculous peritonitis from other causes of ascites.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Peritoneal fluid.
• Collection Method: Collect peritoneal fluid using standard aseptic
techniques.
• Volume: Minimum 1 mL of peritoneal fluid.
• Transport and Storage: The specimen should be transported to
the laboratory at 4°C within 2 hours of collection or frozen at
-20°C if delayed.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• ADA Assay Kit (commercially available)
• Spectrophotometer (if using a spectrophotometric method)
• Incubator set to 37°C
• Centrifuge
• Micropipettes and tips
• Vortex mixer
• Calibrated volumetric flasks
• Distilled water
• Control samples (Negative and Positive ADA controls)
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation of Reagents and Standards:
1. Prepare all reagents and standards as per the manufacturer's
instructions included in the ADA assay kit.
2. Ensure that the spectrophotometer is calibrated and blanked
with distilled water.
B. Sample Preparation:
1. Thaw frozen peritoneal fluid samples at room temperature if
applicable.
2. Mix the sample thoroughly using a vortex mixer.
3. Centrifuge the sample at 2000 x g for 10 minutes to remove any
particulates.
C. Assay Procedure (Example using a Spectrophotometer):
1. Pipette 50 µL of the peritoneal fluid sample into a labeled test
tube.
2. Add 200 µL of the ADA substrate buffer solution to the sample
tube.
3. Incubate the reaction mixture at 37°C for 60 minutes.
4. After incubation, stop the reaction by adding 250 µL of stop
solution from the ADA kit.
5. Mix the reaction mixture thoroughly and read the absorbance of
the sample at 620 nm using a spectrophotometer.
6. Compare the absorbance readings of the samples with those of
the ADA standards to determine the ADA activity in U/L.
D. Quality Control:
1. Run negative and positive control samples with each batch of
patient samples.
2. Record and review the control results to ensure they are within
the specified range before reporting patient results.
3. If controls are out of range, troubleshoot and repeat the assay
for all affected samples.
4. CALCULATIONS
Follow the manufacturer's instructions to calculate the ADA activity in
U/L. This usually involves comparing sample absorbance values to a
standard curve generated from known ADA concentrations.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Document the ADA activity in U/L in the laboratory information
system (LIS).
• Review and verify results before delivering the final report to
ensure accuracy.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Normal Reference Range: 0-40 U/L (Values may vary depending
on the assay kit and method used; refer to kit insert for the
specific reference range).
• Elevated ADA levels may indicate the presence of tuberculosis or
other conditions causing peritoneal inflammation.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform and document all quality control procedures as specified.
• Follow the laboratory's quality assurance and control protocol to
ensure consistent and accurate test performance.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Samples with gross hemolysis, lipemia, or contamination may
interfere with ADA measurements.
• Proper sample collection, handling, and storage are critical to
ensure accurate results.
1. SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS
• Handle all specimens and reagents according to the laboratory's
biosafety and chemical safety protocols.
• Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) at all
times.
