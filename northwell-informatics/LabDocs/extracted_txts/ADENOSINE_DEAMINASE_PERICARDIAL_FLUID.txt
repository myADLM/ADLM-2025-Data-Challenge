Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analysis of Adenosine
Deaminase (ADA) in Pericardial Fluid
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for testing Adenosine Deaminase (ADA)
levels in pericardial fluid samples during the analytical phase. This
SOP ensures accurate and consistent results are generated and
reported in compliance with regulatory standards.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel responsible for
processing pericardial fluid specimens for ADA analysis.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
Laboratory technologists are responsible for performing the ADA test
as outlined in this SOP, ensuring proper documentation, quality
control, and timely reporting of results. Supervisors must review
results and maintain the accuracy and reliability of all testing
procedures.
4. DEFINITIONS
Adenosine Deaminase (ADA): An enzyme involved in purine
metabolism. Elevated levels in pericardial fluid can indicate
tuberculous pericarditis or other infectious or inflammatory conditions.
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen:
• Preferred: Pericardial fluid collected in a sterile container.
• Volume: Minimum of 0.5 mL pericardial fluid.
• Handling and Storage: Transport the specimen to the lab
immediately. If immediate analysis is not possible, refrigerate at
2-8°C. Specimens can be stored refrigerated for up to 72 hours.
For prolonged storage, freeze at -20°C or below.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens contaminated with blood.
• Specimens received in unsterile or improperly labeled containers.
• Specimens received after prolonged transit or mishandling,
compromising integrity.
6. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Spectrophotometer or automated ADA analyzer
• ADA reagent kit (compatible with the equipment used)
• Calibrators and controls
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Centrifuge
• Sterile containers for pericardial fluid collection
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run quality control materials (at least two levels: normal and high)
with each batch of patient samples to ensure accuracy and
precision.
• Document all QC results and take corrective actions if QC fails.
Do not report patient results until QC issues are resolved.
8. PROCEDURE
Pre-Analytical Phase:
1. Verify patient identification and specimen labeling.
2. Log the specimen into the laboratory information system.
3. Inspect the specimen for proper volume and any signs of
contamination or clotting.
4. Centrifuge the specimen at 1500 x g for 10 minutes to remove
cellular debris.
Analytical Phase:
1. Prepare reagents and calibrators according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Set up and calibrate the ADA analyzer/spectrophotometer as
per the equipment manual.
3. Pipette the required volume of calibrator, control, and patient
sample into corresponding wells or cuvettes.
4. Add the ADA reagent to each well/cuvette and mix gently.
5. Incubate the reaction mixture at room temperature (20-25°C)
for the time specified in the reagent kit instructions.
6. Measure the absorbance or colorimetric change at the
recommended wavelength using the spectrophotometer or ADA
analyzer.
7. Record the absorbance values and calculate ADA activity using
the provided calibration curve or software.
Post-Analytical Phase:
1. Record the ADA results in the laboratory information system.
2. Update patient records and notify the appropriate healthcare
provider if results fall outside the reference range.
3. Interpret results with reference to the established cut-offs for
ADA levels in pericardial fluid (<40 U/L is generally considered
normal, values >40 U/L may suggest tuberculosis or other
infections).
9. REPORTING RESULTS
• Verify results through a second technologist or supervisor before
reporting.
• Ensure results are reviewed for consistency and accuracy.
• Report critical values immediately to the requesting physician.
• Document the final reported results along with any interpretative
comments required.

11. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolysis, lipemia, or icteric specimens may interfere with ADA
results.
• Ensure proper storage and handling to avoid degradation of ADA
activity.
• Cross-reactivity with other biochemical markers should be
considered when interpreting results.
12. SAFETY PRECAUTIONS
• Follow all standard laboratory safety protocols when handling
biological specimens.
• Use PPE including gloves, lab coat, and face protection.
• Dispose of waste material in accordance with biohazard
regulations.
13. DOCUMENTATION
• ADA Testing Log
• Temperature Monitoring Log for reagent storage
• Quality Control Records
• Maintenance and Calibration Logs for equipment used
By adhering to this SOP, the laboratory ensures standardized,
accurate, and reliable testing for Adenosine Deaminase levels in
pericardial fluid, crucial for diagnostic and clinical management.
