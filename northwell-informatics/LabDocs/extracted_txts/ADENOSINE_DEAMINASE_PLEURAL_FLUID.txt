Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Procedure for Generating Results for Adenosine
Deaminase (ADA) in Pleural Fluid
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedures for the analysis of adenosine deaminase
(ADA) activity in pleural fluid specimens to ensure consistent, and
accurate test results, adhering to acceptable laboratory standards.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all personnel involved in the analysis and
reporting of ADA activity levels in pleural fluid.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Laboratory Technicians: Perform the analysis, ensure proper
maintenance and operation of the equipment, and document all
procedures and results accurately.
• Supervisors: Oversee the procedure, validate results, address
any analytical discrepancies, and ensure compliance with
laboratory regulations and quality control guidelines.
4. DEFINITION
Adenosine Deaminase (ADA) is an enzyme that acts as a diagnostic
marker for tuberculosis in pleural effusion.
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Pleural Fluid
• Specimen Volume: Minimum 1 mL
• Transport and Stability:
◦ Transport the pleural fluid specimen at 2-8°C.
◦ Ideally processed within 24 hours of collection. If processing is
delayed, store the specimen at -20°C.
• Unacceptable Specimens:
◦ Specimens that are visibly contaminated.
◦ Specimens that are hemolyzed or not stored properly.
6. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
• Centrifuge
• Water bath or heating block
• ADA reagent kit
• Micropipettes and tips
• Calibrated timer
• ADA calibrators and controls
• Disposable gloves and lab coat
7. REAGENT PREPARATION AND STORAGE
• Use ADA reagent kits stored at 2-8°C. Do not use reagents past
their expiration date.
• Prepare reagents as specified in the ADA reagent kit instructions.
• Any remaining reagents should be properly capped and stored
according to manufacturer’s guidelines.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include at least two levels of control (i.e., normal and abnormal)
with each run of patient specimens.
• Document the control results in the Quality Control Log.
• If control results fall outside acceptable ranges, do not proceed
with patient sample analysis and troubleshoot as required. Notify
the supervisor immediately.
9. PROCEDURE
1. Preparation:
◦ Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE)
including gloves and lab coat.
◦ Allow specimens and controls to reach room temperature
before analysis.
2. Specimen Handling:
◦ Centrifuge pleural fluid specimen at 3000 rpm for 10
minutes to remove any particulates.
◦ Carefully transfer the clear supernatant to a clean tube for
analysis.
3. ADA Enzyme Reaction:
◦ Label tubes for blank, calibrators, controls, and patient
samples.
◦ Add 100 µL of ADA calibrators, controls, and patient
samples into appropriately labeled tubes.
◦ Add 1 mL of the ADA reagent to each tube.
◦ Mix gently and incubate at 37°C for 60 minutes.
4. Reaction Stopping:
◦ Stop the reaction by adding 2 mL of stopping reagent as
specified in the ADA kit instructions.
◦ Read the absorbance of each tube at 630 nm using a
suitable spectrophotometer.
5. Calculation:
◦ Calculate the ADA activity in pleural fluid by comparing the
absorbance values of the patient samples to the calibration
curve prepared from the ADA calibrators.
◦ Document the values according to laboratory-specific
reporting guidelines.
10. REPORTING RESULTS
• Reference Interval:
◦ ADA levels in pleural fluid: 0–40 U/L (units per liter). Note this
range may vary based on specific kit recommendations and
population studies.
• Record findings in the LIS (Laboratory Information System).
• Any ADA result above the clinical threshold (usually >40 U/L)
should be highlighted and reported promptly to the corresponding
healthcare provider.
• Results having significant laboratory errors or discrepancies must
be flagged and rerun if necessary, with proper documentation.
11. MAINTENANCE AND TROUBLESHOOTING
• Regularly calibrate and maintain laboratory equipment per the
manufacturer’s instructions.
• Document maintenance activities in the Maintenance Log.
• If the spectrophotometer or any analytical equipment fails during
the analysis, halt testing and follow equipment troubleshooting
protocols. Inform the supervisor immediately.
12. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolysis can interfere with ADA measurements and may result
in falsely elevated results.
• Proper centrifugation is crucial to avoid erroneous results.
13. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions for the ADA reagent kit.
• Guidelines from clinical standards (e.g., CLSI guidelines)
• Laboratory internal procedures and SOPs update logs.
