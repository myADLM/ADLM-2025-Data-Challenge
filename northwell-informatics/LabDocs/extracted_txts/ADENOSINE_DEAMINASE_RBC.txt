Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase Protocol for Generating Results for
ADENOSINE DEAMINASE, RBC
1. PURPOSE:
The purpose of this Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is to
outline the procedure for the measurement of Adenosine Deaminase
(ADA) activity in Red Blood Cells (RBCs). The SOP provides
instructions for the analysis and ensures uniformity and accuracy in
the results.
Responsibility: It is the responsibility of all designated laboratory
personnel to follow this procedure, ensuring that all steps are
performed accurately and recorded properly. Supervisors are tasked
with overseeing adherence to the SOP and addressing any issues
that may arise.
1. SPECIMEN:
A. Preferred/Acceptable Specimen:
• Whole blood sample collected in an EDTA or heparinized tube.
• Transport to the laboratory within 2 hours and keep refrigerated
until analysis.
B. Unacceptable Specimen:
• Specimens that show visible signs of hemolysis or have been at
room temperature for more than 2 hours.
• Samples in tubes other than EDTA or heparinized tubes, such as
citrate or fluoride/oxalate tubes.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES:
◦ Centrifuge
◦ ADA assay kit (vendor-specific)
◦ Spectrophotometer
◦ Pipettes and micropipette tips
◦ Vortex mixer
◦ Reagents: hemolysis buffer, assay buffer, and ADA
substrate
◦ Refrigerated storage 2-8°C
◦ Control samples (Positive and Negative ADA controls)
2. PROCEDURE:
A. Specimen Preparation:
1. Upon receipt of the whole blood sample, record the start time.
2. Centrifuge the blood sample at 1500 g for 10 minutes at 4°C to
separate plasma and RBCs.
3. Remove the plasma and resuspend the RBC pellet in an equal
volume of cold hemolysis buffer.
4. Vortex the mixture thoroughly to ensure complete lysis of
RBCs.
5. Centrifuge the lysate at 10000 g for 10 minutes at 4°C to pellet
any cellular debris.
6. Collect the supernatant, which contains soluble proteins, for the
ADA assay.
B. ADA Activity Assay:
1. Allow all reagents and materials to reach room temperature
before use.
2. Prepare reaction mixtures according to the instructions
provided by the ADA assay kit.
3. Include both Positive and Negative controls in each assay
batch.
4. Add 50 µL of the RBC lysate supernatant to each well of a 96-
well microplate, in triplicates.
5. Add an appropriate volume of assay buffer and ADA substrate
to each well. Mix gently.
6. Incubate the reaction mixtures at 37°C for the time specified in
the kit's instructions (typically 30 minutes to 1 hour).
7. Measure the absorbance of the reaction products at the
specified wavelength (e.g., 450 nm) using a spectrophotometer
following the manufacturer’s instructions.
8. Calculate the ADA activity in the samples using the provided
standard curve and equation from the ADA assay kit.
9. QUALITY CONTROL:
◦ Quality control samples (Positive and Negative) must be
included in each run to ensure the validity of the assay.
◦ Perform calibrations and maintenance of the
spectrophotometer as per the manufacturer's guidelines.
◦ Document all control results and take appropriate corrective
actions if results fall outside the acceptable range.
10. REPORTING RESULTS:
◦ Review and verify all results in the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
◦ Report ADA activity in RBCs in units per liter (U/L) or other
indicated unit, based on assay kit instructions.
◦ Critical or out-of-range results must be communicated
immediately to the attending physician or appropriate
medical personnel, following laboratory protocols for critical
values.
11. REFERENCE INTERVALS:
◦ Reference intervals for ADA activity in RBCs should be
included, based on validated data provided by the assay kit
or laboratory validation studies.
12. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
◦ Hemolysis in the blood sample can interfere with the results.
◦ Samples not processed or stored as recommended may
yield inaccurate results.
◦ Refer to the reagent kit insert for specific limitations related
to the ADA assay.
13. REFERENCES:
◦ Manufacturer’s instructions for the ADA assay kit.
◦ Relevant clinical guidelines and literature from peer-
reviewed journals.
14. DOCUMENT CONTROL:
• Review and updates of this SOP will be done annually or as
required by changes in methodologies or reagent kits.
By adhering to this SOP, laboratory personnel will ensure
consistency, accuracy, and reliability in the measurement of
Adenosine Deaminase activity in Red Blood Cells, thereby supporting
correct clinical diagnosis and patient management.
