Protocol for Adenovirus DNA Detection and Quantification in
Plasma
1. PURPOSE To detect and quantify adenovirus DNA in plasma
samples using quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). This protocol
ensures accurate, reproducible, and timely results.
2. EQUIPMENT, MATERIALS, AND REAGENTS
• qPCR Instrument (e.g., Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast Real-Time
PCR System)
• Micropipettes (variable volumes: 1 µL - 1000 µL)
• Sterile, DNA-free pipette tips with aerosol barrier
• qPCR reaction plates or tubes
• Plate sealer or optical qPCR caps
• Vortex mixer
• Centrifuge with plate adapter
• Nucleic acid extraction system (e.g., QIAcube) or manual
extraction kits (e.g., QIAamp DNA Mini Kit)
• Adenovirus DNA qPCR Kit (including primers, probes, and master
mix)
• 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 (for resuspension)
• RNAse/DNAse-free water
• Positive control DNA (Adenovirus DNA)
• Negative control (DNA-free water)
3. PROTOCOL A) Specimen Preparation
1. Ensure plasma samples are properly labeled and accessioned
in the laboratory information system.
2. Store plasma samples at -80°C until the time of analysis.
3. Thaw plasma samples on ice before proceeding with DNA
extraction.
B) Nucleic Acid Extraction
1. Extract DNA from 200 µL of plasma using the nucleic acid
extraction system or manual extraction kits according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Elute the extracted DNA in 100 µL of RNAse/DNAse-free water
or 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0.
3. Store extracted DNA at -20°C if not used immediately.
C) qPCR Setup
1. Thaw reagents (master mix, primers, probes) and controls on
ice. Ensure all components are thoroughly mixed by vortexing
and briefly centrifuge.
2. Prepare the qPCR reaction mix in a sterile, DNA-free
environment to avoid contamination.
3. Set up a reaction mix for each sample and control as follows:
◦ 10 µL of 2X qPCR master mix
◦ 1 µL of forward primer (10 µM)
◦ 1 µL of reverse primer (10 µM)
◦ 1 µL of probe (10 µM)
◦ 5 µL of extracted DNA template or control (positive or
negative)
◦ 2 µL of RNAse/DNAse-free water to a total volume of 20 µL
per reaction
4. Carefully mix the reaction mix by pipetting up and down.
5. Aliquot 20 µL of the reaction mix into each well of the qPCR
plate or tube.
D) qPCR Cycling Conditions
1. Seal the qPCR plate with optical adhesive film or cap the tubes.
2. Centrifuge the plate or tubes briefly to ensure all liquid is at the
bottom.
3. Place the plate or tubes into the qPCR instrument and set the
program as follows:
◦ Initial activation: 95°C for 10 minutes
◦ Amplification (40 cycles):
▪ Denaturation: 95°C for 15 seconds
▪ Annealing/Extension: 60°C for 1 minute
4. Ensure fluorescence data is collected at the end of each cycle
during the annealing/extension phase.
E) Data Analysis
1. After the run is complete, review the amplification plots and
threshold cycle (Ct) values.
2. Ensure the negative control shows no amplification curve.
3. Ensure the positive control has a Ct value within the expected
range.
4. Quantify the viral load by comparing sample Ct values to a
standard curve (if using quantitative analysis).
F) Quality Control
1. Include both positive and negative controls in each run.
2. Use an internal control (e.g., human GAPDH gene) to monitor
the efficiency of the extraction process and potential inhibitors
in the qPCR reaction.
3. Document all control results and verify they meet the
predetermined acceptance criteria.
G) Reporting Results
1. Record the Ct values and final quantified viral load in the
laboratory information system.
2. Report results including reference range, method used, and any
pertinent observations.

extraction kit protocol, and the Adenovirus DNA qPCR kit insert.
