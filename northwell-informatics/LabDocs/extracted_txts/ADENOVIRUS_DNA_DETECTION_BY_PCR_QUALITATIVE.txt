1. PURPOSE
To establish a standardized procedure for the qualitative detection of
Adenovirus DNA in human clinical specimens using Polymerase
Chain Reaction (PCR) methodology. This protocol ensures
consistent, reliable, and accurate test results.
2. SCOPE
This protocol applies to the laboratory personnel who are responsible
for performing the Adenovirus DNA detection assay by PCR on
clinical specimens. It covers the steps from specimen preparation to
result reporting.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
The designated laboratory staff are responsible for adhering to this
SOP when performing the Adenovirus DNA detection by PCR,
ensuring the accuracy of the results, and maintaining documentation
as specified.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Accepted Specimens:
◦ Throat swabs
◦ Nasopharyngeal swabs
◦ Respiratory aspirates
◦ Bronchoalveolar lavage
◦ Stool samples
◦ Urine samples
• Unacceptable Specimens:
◦ Specimens that are not properly labeled
◦ Specimens received in unsuitable transport media
◦ Specimens with insufficient quantity
◦ Specimens that have been stored improperly or beyond the
recommended time frame
5. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• PCR Master Mix
• Adenovirus DNA primers and probes
• Nuclease-free water
• Positive and negative control DNA
• DNA extraction kits
• Thermal cycler (PCR machine)
• Microcentrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Pipettes and filtered pipette tips
• Sterile microcentrifuge tubes
6. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Preparation
1. Use appropriate PPE and work in a designated biosafety
cabinet when handling specimens.
2. Perform DNA extraction using a commercial extraction kit
following the manufacturer's instructions. Elute the DNA in the
appropriate volume specified by the kit.
B. PCR Setup
1. Thaw all reagents on ice and gently vortex and briefly
centrifuge them before use.
2. Prepare the PCR master mix according to the following reaction
setup (for a 20 μL reaction):
◦ PCR Master Mix: 10 μL
◦ Primer/Probe Mix: 4 μL
◦ Nuclease-free water: 4 μL
◦ Template DNA (extracted specimen): 2 μL
3. Include positive and negative controls in each PCR run:
◦ Positive control: Adenovirus DNA
◦ Negative control: Nuclease-free water
C. PCR Amplification
1. Program the thermal cycler with the following conditions:
◦ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 10 minutes
◦ 40 cycles of:
▪ Denaturation: 95°C for 15 seconds
▪ Annealing and Extension: 60°C for 1 minute
2. Load the reaction tubes/plates into the thermal cycler and start
the run.
D. Detection and Interpretation of Results
1. After the PCR run, analyze the amplification data using the
appropriate software.
2. Interpret the results based on the presence or absence of the
target amplification signal.
3. Controls must yield the following results for the run to be valid:
◦ Positive control: Positive amplification signal
◦ Negative control: No amplification signal
7. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Internal and external quality control measures must be included
in every run.
2. Document and review control results to ensure assay
performance.
3. If controls are not within the expected ranges, repeat the assay
before reporting patient results.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Positive: Report as "Adenovirus DNA detected."
2. Negative: Report as "Adenovirus DNA not detected."
3. Inconclusive: If the assay is invalid (e.g., control failures),
repeat the test. Report as "Inconclusive" if issues persist.
9. DOCUMENTATION
1. Record each step of the procedure in the provided logbook.
2. Document any deviations, troubleshooting steps, and corrective
actions taken.
10. REFERENCES
Refer to the specific PCR kit and thermal cycler instruction manuals
for detailed operational guidance.
11. SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS
Adhere to all biosafety and biosecurity protocols to prevent
contamination and ensure the safety of laboratory personnel.
12. UPDATES AND REVIEW
This SOP will be reviewed annually and updated as needed to reflect
the latest best practices and technological advancements.
