Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase of Generating Results for Adenovirus
Immunostain, Technical Component Only
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the process and responsibilities
involved in performing the technical component of the Adenovirus
Immunostain test. This procedure ensures accurate, timely, and
traceable results, and maintains the standards required for a CLIA-
certified laboratory.
2. SCOPE
This protocol applies to all staff responsible for handling, processing,
and analyzing specimens using the Adenovirus Immunostain
technique.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Designated laboratory technologists will execute the immunostain
procedure as described.
• Supervisors will ensure all steps are followed correctly and that
outlined corrective actions are taken when necessary.
• It is the responsibility of all staff to report any issues encountered
during the process to their supervisor.
4. MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT
• Microscope slides with formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue
sections
• Antigen retrieval buffer (e.g., Citrate Buffer, pH 6.0)
• Endogenous peroxidase blocking solution
• Protein blocking solution or serum
• Primary antibody specific for Adenovirus
• Secondary antibody with HRP (Horseradish Peroxidase)
conjugate
• Substrate-chromogen solution (e.g., DAB)
• Counterstain (e.g., Hematoxylin)
• Mounting medium
• Microscopic slides
• Cover slips
• Immunostaining chamber
• Slide warmer
• Humidified chamber
• Timer
• General lab supplies (tweezers, pipettes, etc.)
5. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation
1. Ensure tissue section slides are fixed and deparaffinized.
2. Place slides in a staining rack and immerse in antigen retrieval
buffer.
3. Heat in a microwave or water bath to retrieve antigens (retrieval
conditions per manufacturer's instructions).
B) Blocking
1. After antigen retrieval, allow slides to cool to room temperature.
2. Immerse slides in endogenous peroxidase blocking solution for
the recommended time to block peroxidase activity.
3. Rinse slides thoroughly with PBS (Phosphate Buffered Saline).
C) Immunostaining
1. Apply protein blocking solution to cover each section entirely.
Incubate for the recommended time.
2. Remove excess liquid and apply primary antibody specific to
Adenovirus. Incubate in a humidified chamber for the
recommended time at room temperature.
3. Rinse slides with PBS.
4. Apply secondary antibody with HRP conjugate. Incubate as
recommended.
5. Rinse slides with PBS.
D) Detection
1. Apply substrate-chromogen solution (DAB) and incubate until
desired stain intensity is achieved.
2. Rinse slides with tap water to stop the reaction.
E) Counterstaining and Mounting
1. Immerse slides in hematoxylin solution for counterstaining.
Rinse with water.
2. Dehydrate slides through an increasing alcohol series and clear
with xylene.
3. Apply mounting medium and cover slip.
F) Quality Control
1. Include a positive and a negative control slide in each batch to
validate the staining procedure.
2. Ensure all controls display expected staining patterns before
analyzing patient samples.
3. Document all observations, including any discrepancies, on the
Quality Control log sheet.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results will be reviewed by a pathologist or designated reviewer
who will interpret the adenovirus immunostain.
• Only the technical accuracy of the staining procedure will be
verified by the technologist.
• Enter technical results into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS) for clinical review.
7. DOCUMENTATION
• Log all steps taken, including any deviations from the SOP, in the
laboratory's record-keeping system.
• Record the use of all reagents, including lot numbers and
expiration dates.
• Ensure all documentation is easily traceable to both the specimen
and the individual performing the test.
8. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s guidelines for all reagents and antibodies used in
this protocol.
• CLIA regulations for maintaining laboratory quality and
compliance.
9. AMENDMENTS
• This SOP will be reviewed and updated annually or whenever
new methodology or improvements in technology are adopted.
By following this SOP, we ensure that the technical aspects of the
Adenovirus Immunostain test are performed consistently and
accurately, maintaining the integrity of the laboratory’s analytic phase.
