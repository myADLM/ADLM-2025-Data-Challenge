Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for ADENOVIRUS, MOLECULAR DETECTION,
PCR, VARIES
1. PURPOSE To outline the steps necessary for the analytical
phase of generating results for the detection of Adenovirus
using molecular methods, specifically Polymerase Chain
Reaction (PCR). This protocol ensures standardized, accurate,
and reliable results.
Responsibility:
• Laboratory Technologists are responsible for performing PCR
analysis according to this SOP.
• Supervisors are responsible for overall supervision and ensuring
that procedures are followed accurately.
1. DEFINITIONS
• PCR: Polymerase Chain Reaction, a technique used to amplify
and detect DNA.
• Adenovirus: A group of viruses that infect the tissue linings of the
respiratory tract, eyes, intestines, and urinary tract and can cause
a range of illnesses.
1. PROCEDURE
3.1 Reagents and Supplies - PCR Master Mix (containing DNA
polymerase, dNTPs, MgCl2, and reaction buffers) - Adenovirus-
specific primers and probes - Nuclease-free water - Positive Control
DNA (Adenovirus DNA) - Negative Control (Nuclease-free water) -
Specimen DNA (extracted from patient samples) - PCR tubes or
plates - Optical adhesive film (for PCR plates) - Pipettes and sterile
filtered pipette tips - Thermal cycler with real-time detection capability
3.2 Preparation
3.2.1 Work Area - Ensure that the work area is clean and free of
contaminants. - Set up separate work areas for pre-PCR (reagent
preparation) and post-PCR (product analysis) to avoid cross-
contamination.
3.2.2 Reagent Preparation - Thaw all reagents on ice and mix by
gentle vortexing followed by a quick centrifuge spin to collect
contents at the bottom of the tubes. - Prepare the master mix by
combining PCR Master Mix, primers, probes, and nuclease-free
water according to the reaction volume required.
3.3 Sample Preparation and PCR Setup
3.3.1 DNA Extraction - Extract DNA from clinical specimens
according to the respective DNA extraction kit protocol.
3.3.2 PCR Reaction Setup - Label PCR tubes or wells of a PCR plate
accordingly (positive control, negative control, and patient samples). -
Aliquot the master mix into each PCR tube or well, ensuring an equal
volume is distributed. - Add the extracted DNA from clinical
specimens to the respective labeled PCR tubes or wells. - Include
positive and negative controls in each PCR run.
3.3.3 Sealing and Loading - Seal the tubes or plate with optical
adhesive film. - Briefly centrifuge the PCR plate/tubes to remove any
air bubbles and ensure all components are at the bottom. - Load the
PCR plate/tubes into the thermal cycler.
3.4 PCR Cycling Conditions
Program the thermal cycler with the following conditions:
1. Initial Denaturation: 95°C for 3 minutes
2. Denaturation: 95°C for 15 seconds
3. Annealing: 55°C for 30 seconds
4. Extension: 72°C for 30 seconds
5. Repeat steps 2-4 for 40 cycles
6. Final Extension: 72°C for 5 minutes
7. Hold: 4°C until ready for analysis
3.5 Detection and Analysis
3.5.1 Post-PCR Analysis - After the PCR run is complete, transfer the
PCR plate/tubes to the real-time PCR detection system. - Use the
software associated with the detection system to analyze the PCR
results. - Confirm the presence of adenovirus DNA by evaluating the
amplification curves against the positive and negative controls.
3.6 Quality Control
3.6.1 Positive and Negative Controls - Positive control must amplify
confirming the PCR reaction conditions are optimal. - Negative
control must show no amplification indicating that there is no
contamination.
3.7 Reporting Results - Review and interpret the results ensuring
consistent amplification in the positive control and absence in the
negative control. - Document the results in the Laboratory Information
System (LIS) and report as follows: - Positive: Adenovirus DNA
detected. - Negative: No Adenovirus DNA detected. - Indeterminate:
Inconclusive results, suggest retesting.
3.8 Troubleshooting - If unexpected results occur, verify the cycling
conditions and reagents. - Ensure there is no contamination in the
work area. - Repeat the PCR with fresh reagents and an additional
set of positive and negative controls if necessary.
