Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase Protocol for Generating Results for Adenovirus
PCR, Quantitative
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the steps to be followed for the quantitative
analysis of adenovirus using PCR technology in the laboratory,
ensuring accurate and reliable results.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the
adenovirus PCR assay and documenting all procedures and results
as described in this SOP. It is the responsibility of all staff to ensure
the correct handling of specimens, adherence to protocol, and timely
reporting of results. Supervisors are responsible for monitoring the
adherence to this SOP and addressing any deviations or issues.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Thermal cycler (PCR machine) Microcentrifuge Real-time PCR
detection system Refrigerators/Freezers (-20°C and 4°C) Adenovirus
PCR reagents and kits (including primers, probes, master mix, and
controls) Sterile, nuclease-free microcentrifuge tubes Sterile pipette
tips (filter tips are recommended) Micropipettes Barcode labeling
system Personal protective equipment (PPE) Disinfectant solutions
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen: Preferred: Respiratory secretions, stool or relevant clinical
specimen collected in a sterile container. Unacceptable: Specimens
that have been stored improperly, exhibit leakage, contamination, or
missing identifiers (e.g., collection date/time, patient information).
Specimen Storage: Store specimens at 2-8°C if they are to be
processed within 24 hours of collection. For longer storage, freeze at
-20°C or lower.
1. PROCEDURE
Preparation: Put on appropriate PPE before handling specimens.
Ensure all specimens, reagents, and equipment are properly labeled
and within their expiration dates. Thaw specimens, reagents, and
controls if stored frozen; keep on ice until ready to use.
Extraction of Viral DNA: Use a validated viral DNA extraction method
or commercial extraction kit, following the manufacturer's instructions.
Label sterile microcentrifuge tubes with specimen identifiers. Add the
appropriate volume of lysis buffer and specimen to the labeled tubes.
Perform all subsequent centrifugation and washing steps. Elute the
DNA in nuclease-free water or elution buffer and store at -20°C if not
used immediately.
PCR Setup: Prepare the PCR master mix according to the kit
manufacturer's instructions, including primers, probes, and sample-
specific reagents. Aliquot the master mix into appropriately labeled
PCR tubes or plates. Add extracted DNA (template) to the reaction
mix in each tube or well. Include positive and negative controls in
each run. Seal the PCR tubes or plate securely to avoid
contamination.
Thermal Cycling: Program the thermal cycler with the appropriate
cycling parameters specified for the adenovirus PCR assay. Load the
PCR tubes or plates into the thermal cycler. Initiate the PCR run.
Real-time Detection: Monitor the amplification reaction in the real-
time PCR detection system. Ensure that the system detects the
probes' fluorescence appropriately throughout the cycling process.
Data Analysis: Determine the quantitative results using software
provided with the real-time PCR detection system. Review
amplification curves and threshold cycles (Ct values) for all
specimens and controls. Verify the consistency of results across
multiple runs.
Quality Control: Run internal quality control materials alongside
specimens. Ensure control results fall within the acceptable range
defined by the manufacturer or laboratory standards. Evaluate any
deviations and troubleshoot as necessary.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
Verification: Results must be verified by a trained technologist.
Critical values must be checked and reanalyzed if necessary.
Documentation: Record all results in the laboratory information
system (LIS). Document any issues or deviations observed during
the analytical phase.
Reporting: Follow site-specific guidelines for reporting adenovirus
PCR quantitative results. Critical findings should be promptly
communicated to the requesting physician or clinician according to
established communication protocols.
