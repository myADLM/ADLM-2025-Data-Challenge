Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Adenylate Kinase Enzyme Activity, Blood
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to describe the steps necessary for
the analysis of adenylate kinase enzyme activity in blood specimens
to ensure accurate and reliable results.
Responsibility: It is the responsibility of designated laboratory staff to
follow this SOP accurately and to ensure that all procedures are
conducted under appropriate conditions for optimal enzyme activity
analysis.
1. DEFINITIONS
Adenylate Kinase: An enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of
adenine nucleotides and is an important marker for energy
metabolism in cells.
Specimen: Whole blood sample anticoagulated with EDTA.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Centrifuge • Spectrophotometer • Calibrated micropipettes and tips •
Vortex mixer • Water bath (37°C) • Incubator (37°C) • Adenylate
Kinase Biochemical Assay Kit • Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH
7.4 • EDTA tubes • Disposable gloves
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Preferred Specimen: • EDTA-anticoagulated whole blood
Specimen Stability: • Freshly collected blood samples should be
processed within 2 hours. • If delay is inevitable, store the whole
blood at 4°C for up to 24 hours.
Unacceptable Specimen: • Hemolyzed samples • Clotted samples •
Samples older than 24 hours
1. PROCEDURE
2. Sample Preparation: a. Mix the EDTA anticoagulated blood
sample thoroughly by gentle inversion. b. Centrifuge at 1500 x
g for 10 minutes at 4°C to separate plasma.
3. Plasma Collection: a. Carefully collect the plasma without
disturbing the buffy coat or red blood cells. b. Transfer the
plasma to a clean microcentrifuge tube and keep it on ice.
4. Assay Preparation: a. Set up the water bath or incubator to
maintain a constant temperature of 37°C. b. Prepare all
reagents as described in the Adenylate Kinase Biochemical
Assay Kit manual. c. Equilibrate reagents to room temperature
if stored at 4°C before use.
5. Enzyme Activity Assay: a. In a clean test tube, combine a
specific volume of the plasma sample (as indicated in the kit
protocol) with buffer and substrate solution from the Adenylate
Kinase Biochemical Assay Kit. b. Incubate the reaction mixture
at 37°C for the designated time period (according to the kit
instructions). c. Stop the enzymatic reaction by adding a stop
solution or transferring the tube to an ice bath (as per the kit
instructions).
6. Measurement: a. Measure the absorbance of the reaction
mixture at the specified wavelength using a calibrated
spectrophotometer. b. Record the absorbance value.
7. Calculation of Enzyme Activity: a. Use the provided standard
curve and enzyme activity formula in the Adenylate Kinase
Biochemical Assay Kit to calculate the enzyme activity (U/L) in
the plasma sample. b. Verify calculations according to internal
protocols.
8. Quality Control: a. Run quality control samples (both positive
and negative controls) concurrently with patient samples. b.
Record QC results and ensure they fall within the acceptable
range before validating patient results.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
• Document all calculated enzyme activity results in the Laboratory
Information System (LIS). • Review and validate results according to
laboratory reporting guidelines. • Report critical or atypical results
immediately to the appropriate clinical personnel following standard
communication protocols.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Normal range: 1-10 U/L (values are example references and
should be validated by each lab based on population studies or
kit insert guidelines).
2. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolysis can lead to falsely elevated results - ensure careful
handling of specimens to avoid hemolysis. • Improper storage and
delays in processing can lead to loss of enzyme activity.
