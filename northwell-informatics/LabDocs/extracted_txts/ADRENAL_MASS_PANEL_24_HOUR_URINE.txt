Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Adrenal Mass
Panel, 24 Hour Urine Analysis
1. PURPOSE
This procedure outlines the steps for conducting the Adrenal Mass
Panel on a 24-hour urine specimen. This analysis aims to quantify
the levels of specific catecholamines, and their metabolites
associated with adrenal gland function to aid in diagnosing and
assessing adrenal gland disorders like pheochromocytoma,
paraganglioma, and neuroblastoma.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing,
documenting, and reviewing the test in compliance with this
procedure.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen Type: • 24-hour urine collection, kept refrigerated during
collection and transport.
Preservative: • 25 mL of concentrated hydrochloric acid (HCl)
intentionally added at the start of collection.
Stability: • Maintain refrigerated (2-8°C) during and after the
collection. • Acceptable stability: 28 days refrigerated.
Unacceptable Specimens: • Specimens with incorrect or absent
preservatives. • Urine not collected for the full 24-hour period. •
Specimens with excessive turbidity or hemolysis. • Specimens
without a collection start and end date/time, or those received beyond
acceptable stability limits.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment: • Analytical balance • Centrifuge • Automated chemistry
analyzer (e.g., LC-MS/MS, HPLC) • Calibrated micropipette • pH
meter/pH strips
Reagents: • Internal standards for catecholamines and their
metabolites • Mobile phase solvents for HPLC • Calibration standards
Supplies: • Urine collection containers • Centrifuge tubes • Sample
vials • Volumetric flasks • Personal protective equipment (PPE)
1. PROCEDURE
Pre-Analytical Phase:
A. Verify that the specimen meets the collection criteria and includes
the required preservative. B. Measure and record the total volume of
the 24-hour urine collection. C. Adjust the sample if required to
ensure the pH is between 1 and 3. D. Mix the sample thoroughly to
ensure homogeneity.
Analytical Phase:
1. Sample Preparation: • Centrifuge the urine sample at 1500 g
for 10 minutes. • Aliquot supernatant into properly labeled
tubes. • Dilute the urine with the internal standard solution as
per the guidelines.
2. Chromatographic Analysis: • Prepare the HPLC or LC-MS/
MS system for analysis. • Load samples, calibrators, and quality
control (QC) materials onto the instrument. • Program the
instrument according to the specific method for catecholamines
and their metabolites. • Ensure all reagents and solvents are
prepared fresh and conform to analytical specifications.
3. Data Acquisition: • Monitor chromatograms and mass spectra
for expected retention times and peak shapes. • Identify and
quantify analytes using calibration curves generated from
standard solutions. • Confirm all calculatory and extrapolation
steps conform to analytical guidelines.
Post-Analytical Phase:
1. Data Interpretation: • Compare obtained values against
established reference ranges. • Verify results against QC
materials to ensure accuracy and precision. • Investigate QC
failures and perform troubleshooting as needed.
2. Result Reporting: • Document results in the laboratory
information system (LIS). • Review and verify results follow
established protocols. • Report any critical values to the
requesting physician immediately as per clinical policy.
3. Sample Storage: • Store any remaining aliquots at -20°C (short
term up to 1 month) or -80°C (long term) as per regulatory
guidelines for possible re-testing.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
QC Materials: • Utilize control materials provided by third-party
vendors. • Implement both high and low concentration controls in
each batch run.
QC Procedure: • Perform QC at the start of each working day. •
Include control samples within each batch of patient specimens. •
Document all QC results and assess them in real-time.
Criteria for Acceptability: • Review QC data to ensure values fall
within the established ranges. • Re-calibrate the instrument and
repeat the analysis for QC discrepancies.
1. MAINTENANCE AND TROUBLESHOOTING
Routine Maintenance: • Follow manufacturer guidelines for daily,
weekly, and monthly maintenance. • Replace consumables (columns,
vials) as necessary.
Troubleshooting: • Investigate instrument alarms and unusual
chromatographic results immediately. • Consult instrument manuals
or technical support for unresolved issues.
1. LIMITATIONS
Results are significant only if the sample integrity, collection, and
storage guidelines are rigorously followed. Contamination, improper
preservation, or incomplete collection can lead to erroneous results.
