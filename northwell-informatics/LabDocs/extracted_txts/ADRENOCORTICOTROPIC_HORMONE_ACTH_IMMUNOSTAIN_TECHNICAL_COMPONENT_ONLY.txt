Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Adrenocorticotropic Hormone (ACTH)
Immunostain, Technical Component Only
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to outline the steps for processing
and analyzing specimens for adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)
immunostaining, ensuring accurate and reliable results. This SOP
covers the technical component of the immunostain process.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all designated laboratory personnel trained
in immunohistochemical (IHC) techniques and responsible for
performing ACTH immunostaining in the laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
Laboratory personnel designated to perform ACTH immunostaining
are responsible for following this procedure. It is the responsibility of
the technical and supervisory staff to ensure that the procedure is
followed and that all results are accurate and documented properly.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Microtome
• Water bath
• ACTH primary antibody
• Secondary antibody
• Blocking solution
• Streptavidin-biotin complex
• DAB (3,3'-diaminobenzidine) chromogen
• Hematoxylin counterstain
• Coverslips and mounting media
• Slide racks
• Humidity chamber
• Xylene
• Ethanol (100%, 95%, 70%)
• Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)
• Automated immunostaining equipment (if applicable)
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimens must be paraffin-embedded tissue sections mounted on
positively charged glass slides.
6. SAFETY PRECAUTIONS
• Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) including
gloves, lab coat, and safety glasses.
• Handle all reagents and specimens as potentially hazardous.
• Follow all waste disposal regulations for biological and chemical
waste.
7. PROCEDURE
A. Slide Preparation
1. Cut 4-5 µm tissue sections from paraffin-embedded blocks
using a microtome.
2. Place the tissue sections on positively charged glass slides.
3. Bake the slides at 60°C for 30 minutes to ensure tissue
adherence.
B. Deparaffinization and Rehydration
1. Deparaffinize the slides in xylene for 10 minutes, repeat twice.
2. Hydrate slides in graded ethanol solutions as follows:
◦ 100% ethanol, 5 minutes, twice
◦ 95% ethanol, 5 minutes, twice
◦ 70% ethanol, 5 minutes
3. Rinse slides in distilled water for 5 minutes.
C. Antigen Retrieval
1. Perform antigen retrieval using an appropriate method (e.g.,
heat-induced epitope retrieval (HIER) using a citrate buffer)
according to the manufacturer's instructions for the ACTH
primary antibody.
2. Allow slides to cool to room temperature and then rinse in PBS
for 5 minutes.
D. Blocking
1. Incubate sections with blocking solution to prevent non-specific
binding. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for the blocking
step.
2. Rinse slides in PBS for 5 minutes.
E. Primary Antibody Incubation
1. Incubate slides with the ACTH primary antibody diluted in
antibody diluent as per the manufacturer's recommendations.
2. Place the slides in a humidity chamber and incubate for the
recommended time (typically 30-60 minutes) at room
temperature.
F. Secondary Antibody Incubation
1. Rinse slides in PBS for 5 minutes.
2. Incubate sections with an appropriate secondary antibody
conjugated to a detection enzyme or stain (e.g., biotinylated
secondary antibody) for the recommended time (typically 30
minutes).
3. Rinse slides in PBS for 5 minutes.
G. Streptavidin-Biotin Complex Incubation
1. Incubate sections with streptavidin-biotin complex (if using the
ABC method) for 30 minutes.
2. Rinse slides in PBS for 5 minutes.
H. Chromogen Development
1. Develop the chromogen (DAB or other) for the recommended
time. Monitor under the microscope to avoid overdevelopment.
2. Rinse slides in distilled water for 5 minutes to stop the reaction.
I. Counterstaining
1. Counterstain sections with hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes.
2. Dehydrate in graded ethanol solutions (70%, 95%, 100%) for 5
minutes each.
3. Clear in xylene for 5 minutes, twice.
J. Mounting
1. Apply coverslips using appropriate mounting media.
2. Allow slides to dry thoroughly.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include positive and negative tissue controls with each staining
batch.
• Document the staining run, including lot numbers of reagents,
temperature, and incubation times.
• Review controls to ensure proper staining and troubleshoot if
necessary.
9. DOCUMENTATION
Record all findings and any corrective actions taken in the laboratory
information system (LIS). Ensure that all data is accurate and
complete.
10. REPORTING RESULTS
This SOP covers the technical component only. Interpretation and
reporting of results will be performed by the designated pathologist.
