Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
ADRENOCORTICOTROPIC HORMONE (ACTH), PLASMA Testing
1. PURPOSE
To ensure accurate and timely measurement of Adrenocorticotropic
Hormone (ACTH) levels in plasma samples, which is critical for
diagnosing and monitoring various endocrine disorders, including
Cushing's disease, Addison's disease, and secondary adrenal
insufficiency.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory personnel, including technologists and
supervisors, are responsible for performing, documenting, and
overseeing the ACTH testing procedures. It is also their responsibility
to ensure all quality control measures are adhered to and to take
corrective actions when necessary.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Preferred Specimen:
• EDTA plasma: Blood collected in purple/lavender-top EDTA tubes.
Ensure the tube is filled to the appropriate level to maintain the
anticoagulant properties.
Specimen Handling:
• Immediately after collection, specimens should be kept cool (use
ice packs during transport) to prevent degradation of ACTH.
• Separate plasma from cells within 2 hours of collection by
centrifugation.
• Transfer plasma aliquots to labelled polypropylene tubes.
• Freeze plasma specimens at -20°C or below until analysis. For
long-term storage, samples should be stored at -80°C.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Samples in tubes other than EDTA (e.g., serum, heparinized
plasma).
• Specimens with significant hemolysis.
• Specimens received at the laboratory more than 2 hours post-
collection without proper cooling.
• Samples not properly labelled with patient identification.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Required Equipment:
• Centrifuge capable of handling blood collection tubes.
• Gamma counter or chemiluminescent analyzer capable of
measuring ACTH levels.
• Polypropylene cryovials for plasma aliquots.
Reagents and Supplies:
• Specific assay kit for ACTH (refer to manufacturer’s guidelines for
storage conditions and shelf life).
• Control materials specific for ACTH measurement, including low,
medium, and high concentration controls.
• Calibrated pipettes and tips.
• Ice packs and insulated containers for specimen transport.
• Documentation logs for temperature recording and sample
processing.
1. PROCEDURE
Sample Preparation:
1. Receive the EDTA plasma specimens and log in arrival time
and condition.
2. Confirm the specimen's suitablility (e.g., proper labelling, time
since collection).
3. Centrifuge the EDTA tube within 2 hours of collection at
1500-2000xg for 10 minutes at 4°C.
4. Aliquot the plasma into labelled polypropylene cryovials and
store at -20°C or below until testing.
ACTH Measurement:
1. Set up the gamma counter or chemiluminescent analyzer
following the manufacturer’s instructions. Ensure the instrument
has been calibrated and quality control tests have been
performed.
2. Retrieve frozen plasma samples and thaw at room temperature.
3. Prepare reagent and calibrator solutions according to the assay
kit instructions.
4. Pipette the required volume of plasma, calibrators, and controls
into designated wells or tubes.
5. Execute the assay as instructed in the manufacturer’s protocol,
including incubation times, washing steps, and reading of
results.
6. Document assay conditions, including any deviations and
corrective actions taken.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
Internal Quality Control:
• Perform quality control testing using low, medium, and high
concentration control materials with each assay run.
• Ensure all control results fall within the specified ranges before
verification of patient results.
• If QC results are outside acceptable limits, investigate potential
causes, perform necessary corrective actions, and repeat the
assay if required.
External Quality Control:
• Participate in external proficiency testing programs to ensure
ongoing accuracy and reliability of ACTH measurement.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Review assay results for each patient specimen and reference
control results.
• Verify results against standard reference intervals.
• Enter verified results into Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Document any critical results and notify the requesting clinician
according to laboratory policy.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Be aware of potential interference from biotin, heterophilic
antibodies, or other factors that may affect assay performance;
refer to the assay kit insert for more details.
• Ensure samples are handled properly to prevent degradation that
may impact ACTH levels.
REFERENCES:
• Manufacturer’s insert for ACTH assay kit.
• Relevant clinical guidelines and standard laboratory practices for
hormone assays.
1. SAFETY
• Follow appropriate biosafety protocols for handling human
specimens.
• Ensure proper ergonomics and safety measures when using
equipment and reagents.
• Dispose of biohazard waste following institutional and regulatory
guidelines.
1. DOCUMENTATION
• Maintain comprehensive records of sample processing, assay
conditions, temperature logs, quality control results, and any
corrective actions taken.
By following this protocol, designated laboratory personnel can
ensure accurate, reliable, and timely measurement of ACTH levels in
plasma samples, contributing to effective patient care and
management.
