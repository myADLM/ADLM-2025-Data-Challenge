ANALYTICAL PHASE PROTOCOL FOR
ADRENOCORTICOTROPIC HORMONE (ACTH), PLASMA
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for the accurate analysis and reporting of
Adrenocorticotropic Hormone (ACTH) levels in plasma samples,
ensuring compliance with laboratory standards, quality control
measures, and proper documentation.
2. SPECIMEN
Preferred/Acceptable:
• Specimen type: EDTA plasma
• Collection: Blood should be drawn into a pre-chilled EDTA tube,
kept on ice, and promptly centrifuged to separate plasma. Plasma
must be transferred into a plastic vial and frozen as soon as
possible.
Unacceptable:
• Specimens not stored on ice immediately after collection.
• Specimens not separated and frozen within 2 hours of collection.
• Specimens received thawed or improperly labeled.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Centrifuge
• Chilled EDTA tubes
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Plastic vials for plasma storage
• Freezer (-20°C or lower)
• ACTH assay kit (e.g., ELISA or chemiluminescent immunoassay)
• Automated immunoassay analyzer (if applicable)
• Quality control materials for ACTH assay
4. PROCEDURE
Pre-Analytical Preparation:
1. Ensure that the EDTA plasma specimen is properly labeled and
meets the acceptable criteria.
2. If frozen, allow the plasma specimen to thaw at 4°C.
3. Thoroughly mix the thawed specimen to ensure homogeneity.
Analytical Procedure:
1. Prepare reagent kits and instruments according to the
manufacturer's instructions, including warming, mixing, and
reagent preparation.
2. Set up the calibrators, controls, and patient samples
appropriately.
3. Load samples onto the analyzer or prepare for manual
pipetting:
◦ For manual assays, pipette the required volume of plasma
into wells or tubes.
◦ For automated assays, align the specimen vials in the
instrument's designated locations.
4. Start the assay run, ensuring all maintenance checks and
background readings are within acceptable limits.
5. Monitor the assay run progress and respond to any instrument
alarms or errors promptly.
Post-Analytical Procedure:
1. Review the generated results for each sample, ensuring proper
flagging for any non-conforming data.
2. Compare patient samples to quality control materials:
◦ Low, medium, and high control levels must be within the
acceptable range mentioned in the kit insert.
◦ Investigate any out-of-range controls or calibration issues
promptly.
3. Verify the integrity of the results and resolve any discrepancies
as per troubleshooting guidelines.
4. Transmit verified results to the Laboratory Information System
(LIS) for further review and reporting.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform quality control tests at the beginning of each assay run
and after any major instrument adjustments.
• Use control materials for ACTH, provided by commercial
suppliers, with clearly defined ranges to ensure calibration
accuracy.
• Record all QC results, taking corrective action for any failures,
and document the steps taken.
6. LIMITATIONS
• Hemolysis, lipemia, and icterus may interfere with test results.
Assess sample quality before processing.
• ACTH is highly sensitive to temperature changes; ensure
stringent temperature management of samples from collection to
analysis.
• Cross-reactivity with other peptides may occur with some assay
kits. Refer to the manufacturer’s insert for details.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results should be inspected for any flagged anomalies or
instrument error codes.
• Critical values, if applicable, must be reviewed and followed up
according to laboratory policy.
• Confirm and verify results through the LIS, adding comments as
necessary for any potential interference or quality issues.
REFERENCE INTERVAL:
• The reference interval for ACTH may vary based on the assay
method; refer to the product insert or established laboratory-
specific reference range.
8. REFERENCES
• Product insert for the commercially available ACTH assay kit.
• Laboratory standard operating procedures for sample extraction,
handling, and analysis.
• Manufacturer's instrument manual and calibration guidelines.
9. RECORD KEEPING
• Document all temperatures and conditions during specimen
storage and handling.
• Record all assay runs, including times, reagent lot numbers, and
staff initials.
• Maintain logs for quality control assessments and any corrective
actions taken.
Ensure compliance with these procedures to maintain the integrity
and accuracy of ACTH plasma results.
