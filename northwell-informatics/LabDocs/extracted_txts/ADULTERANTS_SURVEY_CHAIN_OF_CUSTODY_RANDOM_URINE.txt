Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analysis of Adulterants
in Random Urine Specimens for Chain of Custody
1. PURPOSE
To establish standardized procedures for the detection and analysis
of adulterants in random urine specimens, collected under chain of
custody, ensuring proper handling, analysis, documentation, and
reporting.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel involved in the
preparation and analysis of random urine specimens for adulterants,
under chain of custody conditions. This procedure ensures the
integrity and reliability of test results for legal, clinical, and
occupational purposes.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Laboratory Technologists: Perform analysis according to this
SOP and document results.
• Quality Control Officers: Monitor compliance with the procedure
and ensure the accuracy of test results.
• Laboratory Supervisors: Oversee the analytical process, ensure
staff adherence to the protocol, and take corrective actions as
needed.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/Acceptable Specimen:
• 30-60 mL of freshly voided urine in a secure, tamper-evident
container, collected under chain of custody protocols.
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Specimens without chain of custody documentation.
• Specimens with evidence of tampering or inappropriate storage
conditions.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Equipment: Urine aliquoting station, pH meter, specific gravity
refractometer, adulterant test strips/kits, centrifuge (if needed),
and standard laboratory glassware.
• Reagents: Commercial adulterant detection kits (e.g., for
creatinine, specific gravity, pH, oxidants, nitrites), pH calibration
buffers, deionized water.
6. PROCEDURE
6.1 Specimen Reception and Verification
1. Receive Specimen:
◦ Ensure specimens are received with intact chain of custody
forms and tamper-evident seals.
◦ Verify that the specimen container is correctly labeled with
the subject’s identification and collection date/time.
2. Log Specimen:
◦ Record specimen details in the laboratory information
system (LIS).
6.2 Initial Examination and Aliquoting
1. Inspect Specimen:
◦ Check for signs of tampering or contamination.
◦ Note any unusual color, odor, or appearance.
2. Aliquot Specimen:
◦ Gently mix the urine sample and aliquot a portion (10 mL)
into a labelled secondary container for analysis.
6.3 Adulterant Testing
1. Creatinine Test:
◦ Perform creatinine test using a commercial kit.
◦ Report creatinine concentrations as mg/dL.
2. Specific Gravity Test:
◦ Measure specific gravity using a refractometer.
◦ Document specific gravity as a unitless value.
3. pH Measurement:
◦ Measure pH using a calibrated pH meter.
◦ Record pH value accurately.
4. Test for Oxidants:
◦ Use an adulterant test strip to detect the presence of
oxidizing agents.
◦ Record positive or negative result.
5. Nitrites Test:
◦ Test for nitrites using the appropriate reagent or strip.
◦ Document the presence or absence of nitrites.
6.4 Additional Testing (if required)
• If there are signs of tampering, include additional tests as needed:
◦ Glutaraldehyde Test
◦ Chromium Test
◦ Bleach Test
6.5 Quality Control
1. Control Samples:
◦ Include known negative and positive control samples with
each batch of tests.
◦ Document control results and take corrective action if
controls fall outside the acceptable range.
2. Instrument Calibration:
◦ Calibrate instruments (pH meter, refractometer) daily before
use.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Data Entry:
◦ Enter test results into the LIS, ensuring all fields are
accurately filled.
2. Review and Verification:
◦ Verify results by a second technologist or supervisor.
◦ Ensure adherence to chain of custody protocols throughout
the process.
3. Generate Report:
◦ Print or electronically transmit reports as required.
◦ Include chain of custody documentation with the final report.
4. Documentation:
◦ Maintain all records, including test results and control data,
for legal compliance and quality assurance.
