Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase for Generating Results for Adulterants Survey,
Random, Urine
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the procedures for analyzing urine specimens to
detect the presence of adulterants, which may interfere with drug
testing. This SOP includes steps for specimen preparation, analytical
methods, result verification, and documentation.
Responsibility: It is the responsibility of the laboratory staff to follow
all procedural steps outlined in this SOP to ensure accurate and
reliable results. Supervisors are responsible for verifying adherence
to the SOP and ensuring all corrective actions are taken when
necessary.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND ACCEPTABILITY
Specimen:
• Preferred/Acceptable: Freshly voided urine collected in a clean,
sterile container.
• Unacceptable: Specimens arriving without proper labeling,
collection date/time, or in containers exposed to contaminants.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• pH indicator strips
• SpeciDrink (specific gravity reagent)
• Nitrite test reagents
• Oxidant test reagents
• Creatinine reagent
• Validated urine adulterant detection kits (e.g., AdulterantCheck
strips)
• Timer
• Sterile containers
• Laboratory gloves
1. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Preparation and Handling:
1. Verify that each urine specimen is properly labeled with patient
identifier, collection date, and time.
2. Inspect specimen for any signs of tampering (e.g., unusual
color, odor, presence of foreign substances).
3. Document receipt of the specimen in the laboratory log.
B. Adulterant Testing:
1. Specific Gravity Testing:
◦ Use SpeciDrink reagent to measure specific gravity.
◦ Mix reagent with the urine specimen according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
◦ Compare the color change to the reference chart provided in
the kit.
◦ Record results in the Adulterants Survey Log.
2. pH Testing:
◦ Dip a pH indicator strip into the urine specimen.
◦ Remove immediately and allow excess urine to drip off.
◦ Compare the color change to the reference chart on the
package.
◦ Record results in the Adulterants Survey Log.
3. Nitrite Testing:
◦ Use nitrite test reagent strips according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
◦ Dip the strip into the urine specimen and remove
immediately.
◦ Interpret the result as per color change reference provided.
◦ Note and record results in the Adulterants Survey Log.
4. Oxidant Testing:
◦ Introduce the oxidant test reagent into the urine specimen.
◦ Observe for any chemical reaction indicating the presence
of oxidants such as bleach or hydrogen peroxide.
◦ Record findings in the Adulterants Survey Log.
5. Creatinine Testing:
◦ Mix creatinine reagent with urine specimen as per kit
instructions.
◦ Measure and compare to standard reference values
provided.
◦ Document results in the Adulterants Survey Log.
6. Comprehensive Adulterant Test (AdulterantCheck Strips):
◦ Use validated urine adulterant detection kits.
◦ Follow manufacturer instructions for strip-based testing
which may include specific gravity, pH, nitrites, oxidants, and
creatinine.
◦ Interpret results using reference charts and recording in the
Adulterants Survey Log.
C. Result Verification:
1. Review all test results for any deviation beyond acceptable
ranges (refer to quality control guidelines).
2. Perform repeat testing on irregular findings for confirmation.
3. Verify all results and perform quality control assessments as
required.
4. Submit the log and any questionable results to the supervisor
for further review.
D. Quality Control:
1. Run positive and negative controls for all tests at the beginning
of each testing batch.
2. Ensure reagent strips and solutions are within their expiry date.
3. Record the control results in the Quality Control Log.
4. Halt testing and notify supervisor if control results are outside
acceptable ranges.
5. REPORTING RESULTS
• Document verified results using the laboratory information system
(LIS).
• Provide a detailed report including test results, control
assessments, and noted observations.
• All results must be reviewed and signed off by the supervising
technologist.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to kit inserts for specific limitations related to the reagents
and materials used in testing.
1. REFERENCES
• AdulterantCheck Product Insert for Detailed Information.
• SpeciDrink Reagent Instructions.
• Manufacturer guidelines for pH, nitrite, oxidant, and creatinine
testing.
This procedure must be followed meticulously to ensure the integrity
and reliability of the results generated for the Adulterants Survey,
Random, Urine.
