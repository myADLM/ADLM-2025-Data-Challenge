STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP)
1. PURPOSE
To provide a detailed procedure for the processing, cultivation, and
identification of microbial organisms from stool and urine specimens
using aerobic culture techniques. This SOP ensures accurate and
timely generation of results consistent with the laboratory's standards
for quality and reliability.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for processing
specimens, performing cultures, interpreting the results, and
documenting findings according to this procedure. It is the
responsibility of all staff to adhere to the guidelines and report any
discrepancies or issues to a supervisor.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen Types:
• Stool
• Urine (including midstream, catheter, and collected during surgical
procedures)
Preferred:
• Stool: Freshly passed stool, collected within 24 hours, stored at
2-8°C if delayed.
• Urine: Midstream urine specimen collected in sterile container.
Process within 2 hours of collection; if delayed, refrigerate at
2-8°C, but not more than 24 hours.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Stool samples that are dried, more than 24 hours old, or
improperly stored.
• Urine samples that are more than 24 hours old, without patient
identification, or visibly contaminated.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Sterile culture flasks or containers
• MacConkey Agar
• Blood Agar
• Mannitol Salt Agar
• CHROMagar Orientation
• Peptone water for primary enrichment
• Sterile inoculating loops and swabs
• Incubators (set at 35-37°C)
• Microscope and slides
• Gram staining reagents
• Biochemical test kits (API strips)
• Antibiotic susceptibility testing setup (disks or automated
systems)
1. PROCEDURE
A. Processing Specimens:
1. Verify the specimen's identity with the requisition. Ensure the
labeled container matches patient identification information.
2. Perform macroscopic examination of stool specimen (e.g.,
consistency, presence of blood). For urine specimens, record
volume and appearance.
3. Inoculate stool samples by streaking directly onto MacConkey
Agar and Blood Agar plates using sterile loop. Enrich sample in
peptone water if heavy growth is anticipated.
4. Inoculate urine samples by streaking directly onto MacConkey
Agar and CHROMagar Orientation plates using sterile loop.
B. Incubation:
1. Place inoculated agar plates and enrichment broth in incubators
at 35-37°C.
2. Incubate plates for 18-24 hours. Stool enrichment broth may be
incubated up to 48 hours.
C. Interpretation and Identification:
1. Examine agar plates for characteristic colony morphology. Note
color changes and colony appearance.
2. Perform Gram staining on representative colonies.
3. Identify organisms using biochemical tests (API strips) or
automated systems.
4. For urine cultures, perform quantification of colonies (CFU/mL)
to assess the significance of growth.
D. Documentation and Reporting:
1. Document findings in the laboratory information system (LIS),
including colony morphology, Gram stain results, and
biochemical test outcomes.
2. Indicate organism identification and perform antibiotic
susceptibility testing.
3. Record antibiotic susceptibility results and interpret based on
clinical guidelines.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
• Ensure all agar plates and reagents are within their expiry dates
and stored according to manufacturers' instructions.
• Perform and record daily temperature checks of incubators.
• Utilize positive and negative control samples to validate accuracy
of culture procedures and biochemical tests.
• Document and review all quality control measures periodically.

1. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If contamination is suspected, discard the sample and notify the
supervisor for recollection.
• In case of aberrant growth patterns, repeat the culture using a
fresh sample.
• Ensure the proper sample collection techniques are followed by
clinical staff to prevent pre-analytical errors.
This SOP must be reviewed annually or as needed following updates
to standards or identification of procedural issues.
