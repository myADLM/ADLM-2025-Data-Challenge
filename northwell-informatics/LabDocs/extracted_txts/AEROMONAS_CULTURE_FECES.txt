Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for AEROMONAS CULTURE,
FECES
1. PURPOSE: To outline the process and procedures for the
identification and generation of results for Aeromonas species
from fecal specimens.
2. SCOPE: This procedure applies to all clinical laboratory
personnel trained to perform Aeromonas culture from feces in a
CLIA-certified laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY: It is the responsibility of laboratory
personnel to follow this SOP accurately to ensure the reliable
detection and reporting of Aeromonas species from fecal
samples.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND HANDLING:
Preferred Specimen:
◦ Freshly collected stool specimen transported to the
laboratory within 2 hours of collection.
Acceptable Specimens:
◦ Stool specimen collected in Cary-Blair transport medium
and received within 24 hours.
◦ Refrigerated stool specimen if received within 72 hours.
Unacceptable Specimens:
◦ Stool specimens received more than 72 hours after
collection.
◦ Specimens without proper labeling or requisition.
◦ Specimens with visible contaminants (e.g., urine, toilet
paper).
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES:
◦ Bacteriological loop
◦ Incubator (35-37°C)
◦ Trypticase soy agar (TSA) with 5% sheep blood
◦ MacConkey agar plates
◦ Ampicillin blood agar plates
◦ Oxidase reagent
◦ Gram staining reagents
◦ Certified reference strains for quality control
6. PROCEDURE:
Specimen Processing: a. Label all culture media and materials
with appropriate patient identification. b. Use a sterile
bacteriological loop to obtain a small amount of fecal material.
c. Streak the specimen onto TSA with 5% sheep blood,
MacConkey agar, and Ampicillin blood agar plates for isolation.
d. Incubate all plates aerobically at 35-37°C for 18-24 hours.
Plate Reading and Interpretation: a. After incubation, examine
plates for growth. Note colony morphology and hemolytic
reactions. b. Subculture any suspicious colonies onto fresh TSA
plates for further identification. c. Perform oxidase test on
suspected Aeromonas colonies (oxidase positive).
Identification: a. Perform Gram staining on isolated colonies to
confirm Gram-negative rods. b. Employ biochemical tests (e.g.,
Triple Sugar Iron (TSI) agar, motility, and indole production) as
necessary to differentiate Aeromonas from other Gram-negative
rods. c. Use molecular methods such as PCR if available and
necessary for definitive speciation.
7. QUALITY CONTROL: a. Ensure all culture media, reagents,
and equipment are within their expiration dates and perform as
expected. b. Include positive and negative control strains with
each batch of specimens for quality assurance. c. Document all
results and control performance in appropriate logbooks.
8. REPORTING RESULTS: a. Report positive findings of
Aeromonas species in accordance with the laboratory’s
reporting guidelines. b. Include comments on the significance of
Aeromonas findings where clinically relevant. c. Ensure results
are validated and authorized by a technologist before releasing
to the LIS.
9. REFERENCE INTERVALS: Normal reference for a fecal culture
is the absence of pathogenic Aeromonas species.
10. LIMITATIONS: a. Improper specimen collection, handling, or
transportation can affect the recovery of Aeromonas. b.
Overgrowth by normal fecal flora may inhibit the growth of
Aeromonas on culture plates. c. False negatives may occur in
patients already receiving antimicrobial treatment.

(CLSI) guidelines for enteric pathogen isolation and
identification. b. Manufacturer’s insert for media and reagents
used in Aeromonas culture and identification.

This SOP is intended for trained laboratory personnel and must be
followed precisely to ensure the accurate detection and reporting of
Aeromonas species in fecal specimens.
