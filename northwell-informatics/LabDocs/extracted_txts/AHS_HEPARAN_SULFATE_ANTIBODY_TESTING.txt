Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Heparan Sulfate Antibody (AHS) Testing
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedure for the analytical
phase of generating results for AHS/Heparan Sulfate Antibody (HS)
testing. This includes steps for sample preparation, assay setup,
result interpretation, and documentation to ensure accurate and
reliable detection of Heparan Sulfate Antibodies.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing the
assay, documenting results, and ensuring all procedures are followed
per the outlined protocol. Supervisors are responsible for monitoring
the process, ensuring compliance, and addressing any issues that
arise during testing.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Accepted Specimens:
◦ Serum: 3-5 mL collected in a red-top tube or serum separator
tube (SST).
◦ Plasma: 3-5 mL collected in a lavender-top EDTA tube (if
serum is not available).
• Unaccepted Specimens:
◦ Hemolyzed samples.
◦ Severely lipemic or icteric samples.
◦ Samples without appropriate labeling or collection date/time.
Specimens must be properly labeled, and stored at 2-8°C and
analyzed within 48 hours of collection. If testing is delayed,
specimens must be frozen at -20°C or below.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• AHS/Heparan Sulfate Antibody test kit (per manufacturer
instructions)
• Micropipettes and tips (calibrated)
• Centrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Microplate reader with appropriate filters
• Reagent reservoirs
• Serum/Plasma transfer device
• Timer
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation
◦ Allow test kit components and patient specimens to
equilibrate to room temperature before use.
◦ Ensure all equipment is clean and calibrated.
◦ Wear appropriate PPE according to laboratory safety
protocols.
B. Assay Setup
◦ Label all microplate wells according to the layout provided in
the assay kit insert, ensuring space for controls and patient
samples.
◦ Pipet the required amount of reagents and samples into the
wells as per manufacturer instructions, avoiding bubbles
and ensuring even distribution.
C. Incubation Steps
◦ Follow the timeline for incubations precisely as indicated in
the kit instructions to ensure accuracy of results:
▪ Add 100 µL of each diluted patient sample, negative
control, positive control, and calibrator to the appropriate
wells.
▪ Incubate at specified temperature and duration (usually
37°C for 30 minutes to 1 hour, depending on the assay
instructions).
▪ Follow washing steps meticulously (e.g., washing with
phosphate-buffered saline with Tween 20 (PBST) buffer
for 3 cycles).
D. Addition of Detection Reagents
◦ Add the conjugate reagent to each well and incubate
according to the kit's specified time and temperature.
◦ Wash wells thoroughly again as specified in the kit
directions.
◦ Add the substrate solution and incubate for the specified
time until color development is sufficient.
E. Stop Reaction and Measurement
◦ Add stop solution precisely after the recommended
incubation period has elapsed.
◦ Measure the absorbance of each well using a microplate
reader set to the appropriate wavelength (often 450nm with
a reference wavelength of 630nm).
2. CALCULATION AND INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
• Calculate the average absorbance values for the controls and
patient samples.
• Generate a standard curve using the values obtained from the
calibrators.
• Determine the concentration of Heparan Sulfate Antibodies in
patient samples by comparing their absorbance values to the
standard curve.
Interpret results as follows:
• Negative: Below the cut-off value established by the control and
calibrator absorbance values.
• Positive: Above the cut-off value established by the control and
calibrator absorbance values.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run positive and negative controls with each batch of tests to
ensure the assay's performance and reliability.
• Determine the assay's validity based on control results:
◦ Positive control should be within the positive range.
◦ Negative control should be within the negative range.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• All results including patient, control, and calibrator results must be
recorded in the laboratory information system (LIS).
• Results are reviewed and verified by the laboratory technologist
before releasing to the requesting physician.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the specific assay kit insert for detailed information about
potential limitations related to cross-reactivity, sensitivity, and
specificity.
