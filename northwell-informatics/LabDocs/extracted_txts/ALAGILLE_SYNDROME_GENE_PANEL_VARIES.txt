results for Alagille Syndrome Gene Panel.
2. SCOPE This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel involved in
the analytical phase of testing for Alagille Syndrome Gene
Panel.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• It is the responsibility of designated laboratory personnel to
perform the analytical procedures as defined in this SOP.
• It is the responsibility of supervisors to ensure adherence to SOP
and validation of results.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) Platform
• PCR Thermocycler
• DNA Extraction Kit
• Alagille Syndrome Gene Panel Reagents and Primers
• Covaris (Ultrasonic Sample Shearing) Instrument
• QC Quantification Instruments (e.g., Qubit, Bioanalyzer)
• Thermostat-Controlled Incubators
• Computer with bioinformatics software and access to NCBI
databases
1. DEFINITION Alagille Syndrome Gene Panel testing involves
sequencing specific genes associated with Alagille syndrome,
including but not limited to JAG1 and NOTCH2.
2. PROCEDURE
A) DNA Extraction
1. Extract DNA from the collected specimen using a standardized
DNA extraction kit.
2. Quantify the extracted DNA using a Qubit fluorometer or
equivalent.
3. Assess purity and integrity using a Bioanalyzer.
B) Library Preparation
1. Fragment the DNA samples using the Covaris instrument
according to manufacturer instructions.
2. Perform end-repair, A-tailing, and adapter ligation steps
sequentially as per kit protocol.
3. Clean up the samples using magnetic beads as instructed.
4. Amplify the library using PCR with appropriate primers for the
Alagille Syndrome Gene Panel.
5. Quantify and assess the quality of the prepared library.
C) Sequencing
1. Load the prepared library onto the NGS platform following
instrument-specific loading instructions.
2. Set up the sequencing run according to instrument protocol,
selecting the appropriate panel configuration.
3. Monitor the sequencing run for quality control metrics; ensure
coverage depth meets the required threshold.
D) Data Analysis
1. Retrieve raw sequencing data upon completion of the NGS run.
2. Use bioinformatics software to align sequencing reads to a
reference genome.
3. Perform variant calling and annotation using a validated
pipeline.
4. Filter and prioritize variants of interest based on pathogenicity,
relevance to Alagille syndrome.
E) Interpretation of Results
1. Review the variant annotations to distinguish between
pathogenic, likely pathogenic, benign, and VUS (variants of
uncertain significance).
2. Generate a report summarizing the findings with detail on
identified mutations relevant to Alagille syndrome.
3. Include interpretation and possible clinical implications of
detected variants.
F) Reporting Results
1. Verify results by reviewing the final dataset and annotation.
2. Prepare a detailed report including raw data, interpretation, and
clinical relevance of variants.
3. Transmit the finalized report to the Laboratory Information
System (LIS) for review by the ordering physician.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
5. Perform internal quality control checks on sequencing runs,
including metrics like coverage depth and error rates.
6. Use external controls and reference samples periodically to
ensure consistency and reliability of results.
7. Store QC and validation data on central database for future
reference.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS Be aware of potential limitations
including incomplete coverage of target genes, poor quality
samples, and limitations inherent to the bioinformatics pipeline.
9. REFERENCES Refer to standard molecular biology protocols,
NGS platform manufacturer manuals, and relevant scientific
literature on Alagille syndrome.
This SOP draft details step-by-step procedures for the analytical
phase of generating results for the Alagille Syndrome Gene Panel up
until October 2023.
