Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Alanine Aminotransferase
(ALT) (GPT), Serum
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standard procedure for measuring Alanine
Aminotransferase (ALT) (GPT) levels in serum using an appropriate
analyzer. The results will be used for clinical diagnostics and patient
management.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory personnel trained in using the ALT assay and
analyzing serum specimens will follow this procedure.
1. DEFINITIONS
Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT): An enzyme found primarily in the
liver. The measurement of ALT in serum is commonly used to assess
liver health and diagnose liver diseases.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen Type: Serum
Preferred Collection Container: Serum separator tube (SST)
Collection:
• A blood sample is drawn from the patient and collected in an SST.
• Allow blood to clot for 30 minutes then centrifuge for 10 minutes
at 1500-2000 g to obtain serum.
• Transfer serum into a labeled secondary tube if needed.
Stability:
• Store serum at 2-8°C if analysis is to be performed within 48
hours.
• If delayed beyond 48 hours, freeze at -20°C or lower.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples as they may interfere with
the results.
• Specimens treated with anticoagulants such as EDTA, citrate, or
heparin.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Automated clinical chemistry analyzer (e.g., Roche Cobas,
Beckman Coulter AU)
• Centrifuge
• Refrigerated storage (2-8°C)
• Freezer (-20°C or lower)
Reagents and Supplies:
• ALT assay reagent kit specific to the analyzer
• Calibrators and controls
• Pipettes, tips, and laboratory consumables
• Laboratory logbook or LIMS access for documentation
1. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
• Ensure all reagents, controls, and calibrators are at room
temperature before use.
• Prepare the analyzer by running necessary calibration and quality
control checks as per manufacturer's instructions.
Assay Setup:
• Load the ALT reagent kit onto the analyzer.
• Program the analyzer according to the manufacturer’s protocol for
the ALT assay.
• Load patient serum samples, calibrators, and controls into the
designated sample racks.
Analysis:
• Run the assay, ensuring the analyzer follows the programmed
sequence.
• Monitor the run for any error messages and address issues as
required.
Documentation:
• Log the sample identification, date, and time of analysis in the
laboratory logbook or LIMS.
• QC results must be documented and reviewed before reporting
patient results.
Troubleshooting:
• If QC fails, recalibrate the analyzer and re-run controls.
• If errors persist, follow manufacturer's troubleshooting guides, and
notify a supervisor if unresolved.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run three levels of quality control (low, normal, high) at the start
of each batch of patient samples.
• Document control results in the logbook or LIMS.
• If any QC result falls outside the acceptable range, investigate the
cause and do not report patient results until resolved.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Once the analyzer completes the run, review all patient results for
the ALT levels.
• Ensure results are within the assay’s reportable range. Any
outliers should be flagged for further review.
• Transmit results to the LIS system for review and verification by
the technologist.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Refer to the specific reference intervals provided by the reagent
manufacturer, typically ranging from:
◦ Males: 10-40 U/L
◦ Females: 7-35 U/L
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolysis, lipemia, and icterus can interfere with ALT
measurement.
• Specimen stability should be observed to ensure accuracy.
