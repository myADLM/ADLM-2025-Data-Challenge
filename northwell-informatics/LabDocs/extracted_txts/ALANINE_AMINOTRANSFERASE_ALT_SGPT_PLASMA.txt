Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Alanine
Aminotransferase (ALT/SGPT), Plasma
1. PURPOSE:
To define the analytical procedures for the accurate measurement of
Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT/SGPT) levels in plasma samples.
This protocol ensures consistency, accuracy, and reliability of results.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND HANDLING:
Preferred Specimen: Plasma collected in lithium heparin,
potassium EDTA, or sodium heparin tubes. i. Collect venous
blood using standard venipuncture techniques. ii. Ensure the
specimen is well-mixed by gently inverting the collection tube
8-10 times. iii. Centrifuge the sample at 3,000 rpm for 10
minutes to separate the plasma from whole blood. iv. Aliquot the
clear supernatant plasma into a properly labeled tube for
analysis. v. Analyze the specimen as soon as possible; if
delayed, store at 2-8°C for up to 48 hours or freeze at -20°C for
longer storage periods.
2. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES:
◦ Automated Chemistry Analyzer (e.g., Roche Cobas 8000,
Beckman Coulter AU480).
◦ ALT Reagent Kit.
◦ Control materials: Normal and Abnormal level controls.
◦ Calibrators as specified by the manufacturer.
◦ Disposable pipette tips, sample cups, and tubes.
3. PROCEDURE:
A. Preparation: i. Ensure all reagents and control materials are
at room temperature. ii. Verify the analyzer is operating
correctly and perform maintenance if required as per the
manufacturer's manual.
B. Calibration: i. Use the ALT calibrators provided by the
reagent manufacturer. ii. Run the calibration process as
instructed by the analyzer's user manual. iii. Validate calibration
by running calibration checks or quality controls.
C. Quality Control: i. Run normal and abnormal control
materials at the beginning of each shift, after calibration, and
with each batch of patient samples. ii. Document control results
and verify they are within the acceptable range as defined in
the QC procedure. Troubleshoot any out-of-range values before
proceeding with patient sample analysis.
D. Sample Analysis: i. Load the prepared plasma samples
onto the chemistry analyzer. ii. Input patient and sample
identification into the LIS and analyzer system. iii. Select the
ALT/SGPT assay and start the analysis according to the
analyzer's protocol. iv. Monitor the analyzer and ensure no error
messages are displayed during the run.
E. Post-Analysis: i. Review results for all control materials. ii.
Validate patient results by cross-checking for any flags or out-
of-range values. iii. Interpret flags or out-of-range results using
the manufacturer's guidelines and repeat analysis if needed. iv.
Transmit validated results to the LIS (Laboratory Information
System).
4. RESULT REPORTING:
◦ Results are reported in units of IU/L.
◦ Reference Range: 7-56 IU/L (this range may vary based on
the population and individual laboratory; confirm your
laboratory’s reference range).
5. QUALITY CONTROL:
◦ Use multi-level controls daily.
◦ Unacceptable QC results must be investigated, and
corrective actions must be documented.
◦ Recheck controls before reporting patient results if
necessary.
6. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
◦ Hemolysis, lipemia, and icterus can interfere with ALT
results; ensure sample integrity before analysis.
◦ Refer to the reagent package insert for specific
methodological limitations.
7. REFERENCES:
◦ Manufacturer's instructions for the ALT Reagent Kit.
◦ Chemistry Analyzer User Manual.
◦ Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI)
Guidelines.
8. DOCUMENTATION AND RECORD-KEEPING:
◦ Document all calibrations, quality control results, and any
corrective actions taken.
◦ Maintain records according to CLIA and laboratory policies.
Responsible Personnel:
This SOP is to be followed by trained Clinical Laboratory Scientists
and other designated laboratory personnel. All analyzers and related
equipment must be operated following regulatory and manufacturer
standards. All procedures must be performed under appropriate
laboratory conditions and with adherence to safety standards.
Review Cycle:
This SOP is reviewed bi-annually or whenever there's a change in
methods, reagents, or equipment.
