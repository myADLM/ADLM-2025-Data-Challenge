Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Quantitative Analysis of
Urinary Albumin
Section: Analytical Phase – Albumin, 24 Hour, Urine
1. PURPOSE
This guideline outlines the procedure for the measurement of albumin
in 24-hour urine samples to monitor renal function and detect kidney
disease. The protocol ensures accurate and precise results adhering
to the laboratory standards.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel performing albumin
analysis on 24-hour urine specimens in the laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
Laboratory staff assigned to the clinical chemistry section are
responsible for adhering to this SOP for generating reliable and
accurate results. Supervisors are responsible for reviewing the
results, ensuring validation, and performing troubleshooting if
required.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: 24-hour urine
• Collection Container: Clean, dry, and leak-proof container
• Preservative: No preservatives
• Storage: Refrigerate during collection and until analysis
• Volume: Record total volume and ensure a sufficient aliquot
(minimum 10 mL) is taken for analysis
5. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Analyzer: Selective appropriate clinical chemistry analyzer (e.g.,
Roche/Hitachi COBAS or Beckman Coulter AU series)
• Reagents: Urine albumin reagent kit (specific to the analyzer
being used)
• Calibrators: Validated urine albumin standard calibrators
• Controls: Quality control materials in at least two levels (normal
and abnormal)
• Pipettes: Calibrated micropipettes appropriate for the volumes
used
• Other Supplies: Cups for analyzers, timers, gloves, lab coats
6. PROCEDURE
6.1 Preparation of Urines:
• Confirm the specimen meets acceptance criteria (collected as 24-
hour urine, correctly labeled, properly stored).
• Mix the 24-hour urine collection thoroughly.
• Measure and record the total urine volume for the 24-hour
collection.
• Aliquot at least 10 mL of the well-mixed urine into a labeled,
secondary container for analysis.
6.2 Calibrating the Analyzer:
• Follow the specific analyzer's operation manual to perform the
calibration with traceable calibrators.
• Ensure calibration has been performed within the recommended
time frame prior to analysis.
6.3 Quality Control:
• Run quality control samples (both normal and abnormal controls)
with each batch of patient samples.
• Document QC results and ensure they fall within the acceptable
range specified by laboratory standards.
• Troubleshoot and resolve any QC failures according to the
laboratory’s protocol before proceeding with patient sample
analysis.
6.4 Analysis:
1. Sample Loading:
◦ Load the patient samples, calibrators, and quality control
samples onto the analyzer following the instrument’s
instructions.
◦ Ensure samples are appropriately labeled and placed in the
correct sequence.
2. Running the Analysis:
◦ Initiate the analysis sequence on the analyzer.
◦ Confirm all reagents and supplies are in place as needed for
continuous operation.
3. Post-Analysis:
◦ Review the analytical run data for any flagged results or
instrument errors.
◦ Validate the results once QC results fall within the
acceptable range.
6.5 Calculating and Reporting Results:
• Total Albumin Content:
◦ The analyzer provides the albumin concentration in mg/dL.
◦ Calculate the total albumin in the 24-hour urine collection
using the formula: [ \text{Total Albumin (mg/24 hours)} =
\frac{\text{Albumin Concentration (mg/dL)} \times \text{Total
Urine Volume (L)}}{10} ]
• Result Documentation:
◦ Enter results into the laboratory information system (LIS).
◦ Document any required comments on sample quality or
analysis outliers.
6.6 Critical and Reference Ranges:
• Critical Values: Any extremely elevated results should be flagged
and reported to the clinician immediately.
• Reference Range: Typical range is provided as per the
laboratory's validated data (e.g., <30 mg/24 hours for normal
albumin excretion).
7. PROCEDURE NOTES
• Samples must be free from preservatives, interfering substances,
or inadequate volumes to ensure valid results.
• Proper PPE and aseptic techniques should be used throughout
the procedure.
• Any deviation from the procedure must be documented and
consulted with a supervisor.
8. QUALITY CONTROL AND TROUBLESHOOTING
• Bi-daily control checks to ensure accuracy and precision.
• Any issues encountered during analysis should be recorded and
brought to the attention of the supervisor.
• Instrument maintenance and reagents monitoring should follow
the manufacturer guidelines.
