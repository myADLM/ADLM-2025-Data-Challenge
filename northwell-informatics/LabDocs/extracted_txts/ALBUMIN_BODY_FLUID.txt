Standard Operating Procedure: Analysis of ALBUMIN
in Body Fluid
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the procedure for the analysis of albumin in body
fluid samples to ensure accurate and reliable results.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to the analysis of body fluid samples including
but not limited to pleural fluid, peritoneal fluid, and cerebrospinal fluid
(CSF) for the presence and concentration of albumin.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory staff to perform the
analysis of albumin in body fluids according to this SOP. Laboratory
staff and supervisors must ensure all procedures are followed
accurately and results are correctly documented.
4. DEFINITIONS
• Albumin: A protein found in blood and body fluids essential in
various physiological functions.
• Body Fluid: A term used to describe fluids in the body such as
pleural fluid, peritoneal fluid, synovial fluid, or cerebrospinal fluid
(CSF).
5. MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT
• Automated Albumin Analyzer
• Albumin Reagent Kit
• Calibrators and Quality Control Materials
• Standard Laboratory Glassware (pipettes, sample cups, etc.)
• Personal Protective Equipment (gloves, lab coat, safety goggles)
• Laboratory Timer
• Logbook or Laboratory Information System (LIS)
6. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
• Specimen Types: Pleural fluid, peritoneal fluid, synovial fluid,
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
• Specimen Container: Sterile containers
• Volume Required: Minimum of 1 mL of body fluid
• Stability: Samples stable at 2-8°C for up to 7 days. For long-term
storage, freeze at -20°C
7. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation
1. Reagent Preparation:
◦ Prepare reagent solutions according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
◦ Allow reagents to reach room temperature before use.
2. Calibration:
◦ Calibrate the analyzer using calibrators provided in the
reagent kit.
◦ Perform calibration verification as per manufacturer
guidelines.
3. Quality Control:
◦ Run quality control materials at the beginning of each shift
and with each new lot of reagents. Record the results.
◦ Ensure QC results fall within acceptable ranges before
proceeding with patient samples.
B) Sample Processing
1. Sample Identification:
◦ Ensure all samples are correctly labeled with patient
information and requisition forms are complete.
2. Sample Preparation:
◦ Allow refrigerated samples to come to room temperature.
◦ Mix body fluid samples gently but thoroughly before
analysis.
3. Loading Samples:
◦ Load samples into the analyzer following the instrument’s
instructions.
◦ Enter required patient demographics and sample type into
the analyzer or the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
C) Analysis
1. Running the Test:
◦ Select the appropriate assay for albumin on the analyzer.
◦ Start the analysis according to the instrument's SOP.
2. Interpreting Results:
◦ Review results for each sample.
◦ Check for any flags or error messages indicated by the
analyzer.
8. QUALITY CONTROL AND TROUBLESHOOTING
• QC Failure: If QC results are out of range, do not proceed with
patient sample analysis. Investigate the cause, take corrective
actions, and re-run QC.
• Reagent and Sample Issues: If there are issues with reagents or
samples, troubleshoot according to manufacturer guidelines and
document any deviations.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
• Document all results in the LIS or logbook.
• Verify results according to laboratory policy before releasing them
to the healthcare team.
• Critical results must be communicated immediately to the
appropriate clinical personnel and documented.
10. CLEANING AND MAINTENANCE
• Clean the analyzer and work area according to manufacturer
recommendations and laboratory protocols.
• Maintain and service equipment regularly as per the maintenance
schedule.
