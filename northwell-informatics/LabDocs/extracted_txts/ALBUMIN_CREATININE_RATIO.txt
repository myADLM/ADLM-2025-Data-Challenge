Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Generating Results for
ALBUMIN/CREATININE RATIO
1. PURPOSE
To ensure accurate and reliable results for Albumin/Creatinine Ratio
(ACR) analysis using appropriate laboratory techniques and
equipment. This SOP outlines the steps to be followed during the
analytical phase, including sample preparation, instrumentation, data
analysis, and results reporting.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory staff are responsible for
performing the ACR analysis as specified in this SOP, ensuring
quality control measures are followed, and reporting results
accurately.
1. DEFINITION
The Albumin/Creatinine Ratio is a measure used to assess
albuminuria and evaluate kidney function. It is calculated by dividing
the albumin concentration in urine by the creatinine concentration.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred/Acceptable Specimens:
◦ Random or first morning urine sample collected in a clean, dry
container.
◦ Specimens should be handled and stored at 2-8°C and
analyzed within 24 hours of collection.
◦ Ensure no preservatives are added to the urine sample.
• Unacceptable Specimens:
◦ Urine specimens that have been stored at room temperature
for more than 2 hours.
◦ Specimens with visible contamination or precipitates.
◦ Specimens not labeled with collection date/time.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Automated Chemistry Analyzer (e.g., Roche Cobas, Beckman
Coulter AU)
• Albumin reagent
• Creatinine reagent
• Calibrators and controls
• Urine sample cups
• Micropipettes and tips
• Centrifuge
1. PROCEDURE
A) Sample Preparation:
1. Mix urine samples thoroughly to ensure homogeneity.
2. If the sample contains precipitates, centrifuge at 1000 x g for 5
minutes and use the supernatant for analysis.
B) Calibration:
1. Calibrate the chemistry analyzer as per the manufacturer’s
instructions using the provided calibrators.
2. Document calibration details including the date, time, lot
numbers of calibrators, and initials of the staff member
performing the calibration.
C) Quality Control:
1. Run internal quality control (Two levels: Normal and High)
material prior to sample analysis.
2. Ensure QC results are within acceptable ranges. If not,
troubleshoot and re-calibrate the instrument before proceeding
with patient samples.
3. Document QC results, including corrective actions if required.
D) Analysis:
1. Load the prepared urine samples into the designated positions
on the chemistry analyzer.
2. Load the albumin and creatinine reagents according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
3. Enter the required patient information and test requests into the
analyzer's software system.
4. Start the analysis run and monitor for any flags or errors during
the process.
5. Once the run is completed, analyze the results and ensure that
all samples have valid results.
6. Calculate the Albumin/Creatinine Ratio using the formula: ACR
(mg/g) = (Urine Albumin Concentration (mg/L) / Urine
Creatinine Concentration (g/L))
7. REPORTING RESULTS
8. Review the results to ensure they are accurate and within the
reportable range for the assay.
9. Validate the results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
10. Report the ACR results as mg/g creatinine. Include any
comments if the sample or analysis encountered any issues.
11. QUALITY CONTROL AND MAINTENANCE
• Perform routine maintenance on the chemistry analyzer as
recommended by the manufacturer.
• Ensure all reagents and controls are stored properly at required
temperatures and are within their expiration dates.
• Participate in external proficiency testing programs to validate the
accuracy of the ACR analysis.
