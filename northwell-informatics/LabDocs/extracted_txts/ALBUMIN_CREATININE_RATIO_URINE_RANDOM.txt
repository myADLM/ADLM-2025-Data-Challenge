Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for ALBUMIN CREATININE
RATIO URINE, RANDOM
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for the accurate and timely determination of
Albumin Creatinine Ratio (ACR) in random urine specimens. This
analysis helps in assessing kidney function and detecting early signs
of renal disease.
2. SCOPE
This procedure is applicable to all laboratory personnel who are
trained and authorized to perform urine ACR testing.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• It is the responsibility of the designated lab personnel to perform
urine ACR testing following this SOP.
• Supervisors must ensure that all personnel conduct the testing
accurately and adhere to the documentation and reporting
requirements.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Preferred/Acceptable Specimen:
• A clean-catch random urine sample collected in a sterile
container.
• Specimen should be at least 10 mL.
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Specimens arriving without proper labeling or uncertain collection
time.
• Specimens contaminated with feces or any foreign material.
• Specimens stored beyond the stability time frame.
• Note: Urine specimens can be stored at 2-8°C if there will be a
delay in testing, and must be brought to room temperature before
analysis.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Urine Sterile Collection Containers
• Urine ACR Reagent Kit
• Automated Urine Analyzer (reagent-specific, e.g., Siemens)
• Calibration standards and controls for the analyzer
• Disposable gloves and PPE
• Documentation tools (e.g., ACR logs, LIS access)
• Quality control materials
6. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation:
1. Verify the specimen label and requisition form.
2. Mix the urine specimen thoroughly to ensure homogeneity.
3. Bring the urine specimen to room temperature if it has been
refrigerated.
B. Analyzer Setup:
1. Perform daily maintenance checks on the automated urine
analyzer according to manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Run calibration standards to ensure accuracy and reliability.
3. Load the urine ACR reagent kit and controls into the analyzer.
C. Testing Procedure:
1. Pipette the required volume of urine specimen into the
designated well on the analyzer.
2. Select the “Albumin Creatinine Ratio” test protocol on the
analyzer.
3. Initiate the automated testing process.
4. During testing, monitor the analyzer for any error codes or
malfunction alerts.
D. Quality Control:
1. Perform quality control checks using the low and high controls
provided with the reagent kit.
2. Ensure that all QC results fall within the acceptable range
outlined in the ACR reagent kit insert.
3. Document any deviations and corrective actions taken in the
QC log.
E. Result Analysis:
1. Review the result output from the automated analyzer.
2. Verify the Albumin and Creatinine concentrations comply with
the reference ranges provided by the manufacturer.
3. Calculate the ratio as follows:
ACR = (Albumin concentration mg/L) / (Creatinine concentration mmol/L)
4. Examine any flagged results requiring further attention based
on provided LIS critical value guidelines.
F. Reporting Results:
1. Enter the verified test results into the LIS.
2. Any critical values should be promptly communicated to the
clinician according to local laboratory policy.
3. Document all results and any additional comments or
observations directly in the patient’s record.
7. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Reference ranges may vary based on laboratory-established values.
Commonly:
• Albumin: <30 mg/L
• Creatinine: Normal range of urine creatinine concentration
• ACR: <30 mg/g (normal), 30-300 mg/g (microalbuminuria), >300
mg/g (macroalbuminuria)
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the ACR reagent kit insert for specific limitations regarding
interferences, specificity, and sensitivity of the reagent.
