Protocol for Generating Results for ALBUMIN, PLASMA
1. PURPOSE
To establish a standardized procedure for the analytical phase of
generating results for plasma albumin using automated chemistry
analyzers.
2. SCOPE
This protocol applies to all technical staff involved in the processing
and analysis of plasma samples for albumin determination in a CLIA-
certified laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITIES
• Designated Laboratory Technologists: Responsible for
conducting the albumin assays according to this protocol and
ensuring the accuracy and reliability of test results.
• Supervisors: Ensure that staff are trained, the protocol is
followed, corrective actions are implemented, and documentation
is maintained.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND HANDLING
• Specimen Type: Plasma
• Collection Tubes: Use lithium heparinized plasma collection
tubes (light green or dark green top).
• Volume Required: Minimum of 1 mL plasma.
• Specimen Stability:
◦ Room temperature (15-25°C): up to 7 days.
◦ Refrigerated (2-8°C): up to 14 days.
◦ Frozen (-20°C or lower): up to 3 months.
• Unacceptable Specimens:
◦ Hemolyzed specimens.
◦ Contaminated specimens.
◦ Insufficient volume of plasma.
◦ Improperly labeled or unlabeled specimens.
5. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Automated Chemistry Analyzer (model specific to laboratory).
• Albumin Assay Reagents (specific to the analyzer used).
• Quality Control (QC) Materials: Lyophilized or liquid controls at
low, medium, and high concentrations.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run Quality Control materials at the following intervals:
◦ At the beginning of the day/batch.
◦ After each calibration.
◦ After reagent lot change.
◦ At least every shift (if running continuously).
• All QC results must be within the acceptable range before
proceeding with patient samples.
7. PROCEDURE
1. Preparation and Loading of Specimens:
◦ Ensure specimens are at appropriate temperature for
analysis.
◦ Mix specimens thoroughly before loading to prevent
stratification.
◦ Load the specimens in the analyzer's sample carousel or
designated sample loader.
2. Calibration:
◦ Follow the manufacturer's instructions for analyzer
calibration.
◦ Perform calibration using the approved calibrator material.
◦ Document calibration results and ensure they are within the
acceptable range.
3. Running the Assay:
◦ Select the albumin assay protocol on the chemistry
analyzer.
◦ Ensure reagents, QC samples, and patient samples are
properly loaded.
◦ Start the analysis sequence according to manufacturer's
guidelines.
◦ Monitor the analysis for any error messages or flags.
4. Review and Verification of Results:
◦ Upon completion of the analysis, review results for flags or
outliers.
◦ Verify the results against QC run data to ensure validity.
◦ Re-analyze any samples that fall outside the expected
reference range or exhibit flags.
◦ Record results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results are automatically transmitted to the LIS.
• Review all results for accuracy.
• Ensure any necessary comments or annotations are included in
the report.
• For critical values, follow the laboratory's critical value reporting
protocol.
9. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Adult Normal Range:
◦ Albumin: 3.5–5.0 g/dL
• Pediatric ranges may vary; consult specific references for age-
specific intervals.
10. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolysis can affect the accuracy of albumin results.
• Grossly lipemic or icteric specimens may require special
processing or dilution.
• Samples stored beyond the stability period may yield unreliable
results.
11. CORRECTIVE ACTIONS
• If QC results are outside acceptable limits, do not report patient
results:
◦ Recalibrate the analyzer.
◦ Re-run QC materials.
◦ If the problem persists, contact technical support.
• Document all corrective actions taken.
12. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instruction manuals for the specific chemistry
analyzer and reagents.
• Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines for
albumin measurement.
13. DOCUMENTATION
• Maintain records of all calibrations, QC results, and maintenance
activities.
• Ensure all result reports are properly signed and stored according
to laboratory protocols.
14. REVIEW AND APPROVAL
• This protocol must be reviewed annually and approved by the
Laboratory Director or designee.
