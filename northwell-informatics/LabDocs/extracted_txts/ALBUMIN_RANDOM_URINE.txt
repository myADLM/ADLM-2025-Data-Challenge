Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analysis of Albumin,
Random, Urine (ALB, U)
1. PURPOSE To provide standardized procedures for the analysis
and reporting of urine albumin levels in randomly collected urine
specimens. This ensures consistency, accuracy, and reproducibility of
test results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY It is the responsibility of trained laboratory staff
to perform urine albumin testing and ensure that all procedures are
followed correctly. They must document all actions and observations
meticulously and take appropriate corrective actions if needed.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Urine albumin assay kits
• Automated Urinalysis Analyzer or Specialized Urine Chemistry
Analyzers
• Control materials (Normal and Abnormal)
• Calibrators
• Gloves, pipettes, and pipette tips
• Disposable sample cups
• Waste containers for biohazard disposal
4. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Requirements
• Preferred/Acceptable:
◦ Collect urine specimen randomly at any time. Preferred
volume is at least 10 mL.
◦ No preservatives needed.
◦ Store the sample at 2-8°C if not analyzed immediately; bring to
room temperature before analysis.
• Unacceptable:
◦ Specimens with visible debris or contamination.
◦ Samples that are not properly labeled with patient ID, time,
and date of collection.
B. Quality Control
• Material:
◦ Use two levels of quality control material: Normal and
Abnormal.
◦ Control materials should be stored at 2-8°C when not in use.
◦ Allow controls to come to room temperature before use.
• Procedure:
◦ Run controls at the beginning of each shift or whenever a new
reagent lot, calibrator, or significant maintenance has been
completed.
◦ Record all control results in the Quality Control log.
◦ Results must fall within acceptable ranges. If not, repeat the
control test. If still out of range, take corrective actions as
specified in the analyzer's manual.
C. Calibration
• Calibrate the analyzer as recommended by the manufacturer,
typically with each new lot of reagents and periodically as
required.
• Document all calibration data and results.
D. Analysis Procedure
• Mix the urine sample well.
• Use a clean pipette tip to transfer the required volume of the urine
sample into a disposable sample cup.
• Load the sample cup onto the automated analyzer.
• Follow the specific operational instructions for the chosen
analyzer to perform the urine albumin test.
E. Troubleshooting
• If analyzer flags an error or results are suspect:
◦ Recheck the sample and repeat the analysis.
◦ Verify proper calibration and control performance.
◦ Consult the analyzer’s manual and take appropriate corrective
action.
◦ Document all troubleshooting steps and actions taken.
F. Reporting Results
• Results are automatically uploaded to the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
• Review and verify results before final reporting.
• If required, manually enter results that cannot be automatically
transmitted.
• Report critical values as per the laboratory’s established policies.
5. REPORTING AND INTERPRETATION
• Reference Intervals:
◦ Albumin, Urine (Random): <30 mg/g creatinine (normal)
• Method Limitations:
◦ High concentration of glucose or proteins other than albumin
can interfere with the test results.
◦ Hematuria and certain medications may also affect the results.
◦ Refer to the Albumin assay kit insert for detailed limitations.
6. DOCUMENTATION AND RECORD KEEPING
• Maintain records of all performed tests, control and calibration
activities, troubleshooting, and corrective actions.
• Ensure proper documentation in LIS and physical logbooks as
needed.

• Manufacturer’s insert for the urine albumin assay kit.

procedure manuals.
