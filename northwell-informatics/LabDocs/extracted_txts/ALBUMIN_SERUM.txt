ALBUMIN, SERUM ANALYSIS PROTOCOL
1. PURPOSE
This protocol outlines the procedures for the analytical phase of
measuring the albumin concentration in serum specimens. The aim is
to ensure accurate, consistent, and reproducible results that meet
quality standards. This protocol includes specimen handling,
equipment, reagent preparation, analysis, quality control, and
reporting of results.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing serum
albumin analysis following this protocol. All staff must ensure proper
handling of specimens, accurate operation of equipment, adherence
to quality control measures, and correct reporting of results.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/acceptable:
• Serum specimens collected in red-top tubes or serum separator
tubes (SST).
• Properly labeled with patient’s name, identification number, date,
and time of collection.
Unacceptable:
• Hemolyzed specimens
• Specimens with incorrect labeling or missing information
• Specimens collected in anticoagulant tubes (e.g., EDTA, citrate,
or fluoride)
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Automated chemistry analyzer (e.g., Roche Cobas 8000)
• Albumin reagent kits compatible with the chemistry analyzer (e.g.,
Bromocresol Green method)
• Calibrators and controls (low, normal, and high levels)
• Pipettes and tips
• Timer
• Standard laboratory supplies (gloves, lab coats, etc.)
1. PROCEDURE
A. Calibration and Quality Control
1. Calibrate the chemistry analyzer following manufacturer
guidelines using the provided calibrators.
2. Run quality control samples at low, normal, and high levels to
verify system accuracy.
3. Document calibration and QC results daily before patient
specimen analysis begins.
B. Specimen Handling
1. Ensure serum specimens are free from clots and hemolysis and
are stored appropriately until analysis.
2. Allow specimens from SST tubes to clot completely and
centrifuge to remove cellular components.
3. Ensure specimens are at room temperature before analysis.
C. Analysis
1. Load specimen tubes into the chemistry analyzer.
2. Select the albumin test protocol on the analyzer.
3. Ensure all reagent containers are correctly loaded and confirm
proper functioning of the equipment.
4. Run the albumin assay according to manufacturer instructions.
5. Upon completion, review the result data to ensure no errors or
flags are noted.
D. Reporting Results
1. Results are reviewed and verified by the technologist.
2. Unverified results will be assessed and rerun if necessary.
3. Enter verified results into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
4. Follow critical value protocol for reporting significantly abnormal
results immediately to the physician.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform quality controls daily according to manufacturer
instructions.
• Record all quality control outcomes diligently.
• If QC fails, rerun samples or troubleshoot the analyzer as
required.
• Participate in external quality assurance programs regularly to
ensure analytical precision.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Normal Adult Range: 3.5 – 5.0 g/dL (or 35 – 50 g/L depending on
unit preference)
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to reagent kit insert for assay-specific limitations.
• Interfering substances such as bilirubin, lipemia, and hemolysis
can significantly affect albumin measurement.
