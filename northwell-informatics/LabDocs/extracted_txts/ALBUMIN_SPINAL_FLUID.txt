Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: ALBUMIN, SPINAL FLUID - Analytical Phase Protocol
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the steps for the analysis of
albumin in spinal fluid specimens. This procedure ensures the
accurate and timely reporting of albumin levels while maintaining
laboratory safety and compliance with regulatory requirements.
Responsibility: It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory
personnel to follow the procedure as described and to ensure the
quality and accuracy of the test results.
1. SPECIMEN
2.1 Acceptable Specimen:
• Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) collected in a sterile, airtight container
without preservatives or additives.
• Minimum volume required: 0.5 mL of CSF.
2.2 Unacceptable Specimen:
• Specimens contaminated with blood.
• Specimens with visible particulates.
• Insufficient volume (<0.5 mL).
• Specimens not stored or transported correctly (i.e., not kept
chilled if not tested immediately).
• Specimens greater than 24 hours old unless otherwise noted as
acceptable by specific laboratory guidelines.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
3.1 Equipment:
• Automated chemistry analyzer (e.g., Roche Cobas c501,
Beckman AU480).
• Centrifuge.
3.2 Reagents:
• Albumin reagent kits specific to the analyzer being used
(manufacturer details included in respective analyzer manual).
• Calibrators and controls specific to albumin measurement.
3.3 Supplies:
• Disposable pipettes.
• Microliter tubes.
• Appropriate sample cups.
• Gloves, lab coats, and other personal protective equipment
(PPE).
1. PROCEDURE
4.1 Sample Preparation:
• If the CSF sample shows visible blood contamination, the sample
must be centrifuged at 1500 x g for 10 minutes to remove cells
and debris. Transfer the clear supernatant to a new tube.
• Ensure samples are stored at 2-8°C and analyzed within 24 hours
of collection.
4.2 Instrument Preparation:
• Verify that the chemistry analyzer is calibrated and in proper
working condition. Refer to the instrument's manual for daily
startup and calibration procedures.
• Load the albumin reagent kit as directed by the manufacturer.
4.3 Calibration and Quality Control:
• Perform calibration using the calibrators provided with the reagent
kit at the start of the day or after any maintenance or reagent
change that might affect results. Document all calibration data.
• Run two levels of quality control material (normal and abnormal
control) before testing patient specimens. Document QC results.
Quality control results must fall within specified ranges. If QC fails,
troubleshoot according to the analyzer manual and re-run QC
before proceeding with specimen analysis.
4.4 Analytical Procedure:
• Select the albumin (CSF) assay on the analyzer.
• Load samples into the appropriate racks or sample cups.
• Program the instrument to aliquot and mix the sample as per the
manufacturer's protocol.
• Begin the assay analysis according to the instrument's
instructions.
4.5 Result Verification:
• Confirm that quality control results are within acceptable limits
and that calibration is valid before verifying patient results.
• Review patient results for consistency and potential pre-analytical
variables that might impact the results (e.g., hemolysis,
contamination).
• If results are abnormal or inconsistent, re-run the sample to
confirm findings.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Enter verified results into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
• Ensure all result data correlates correctly with patient
identification and specimen information.
• Report critical values immediately to the requesting healthcare
provider and document the notification process.
• Follow site-specific reporting guidelines for interpretation,
comments, and result distribution to the healthcare providers.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• The laboratory must establish and periodically review reference
intervals specific to the CSF albumin assay used. Common
reference intervals for albumin in CSF are typically <35 mg/dL but
should be verified with reference texts and adjusted according to
population-specific data.
1. QUALITY ASSURANCE
• Participate in external quality assurance (EQA) programs specific
to CSF albumin to ensure comparability and accuracy of results.
• Evaluate and document analytical performance, including
precision, accuracy, and linearity at least semi-annually.
• Ensure staff competency and ongoing training in the use of the
analyzer and adherence to this SOP.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to the reagent and analyzer manual for specific limitations
related to interferences (e.g., hemolysis, icterus, lipemia) and
analytical sensitivity.
• Consider potential pre-analytical errors, such as sample handling,
collection timing, and contamination, which may affect results.
