Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase:
ALBUTEROL, SERUM/PLASMA
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is to define
the steps necessary to accurately and efficiently analyze albuterol
levels in serum/plasma samples and to ensure the reliability and
consistency of test results.
Responsibility:
Designated personnel are responsible for performing the analytical
procedure as outlined in this SOP. It is the responsibility of all staff to
identify any deficiencies in the analytical phase and bring them to the
attention of a supervisor.
1. DEFINITIONS
Albuterol: A medication primarily used for the treatment of asthma
and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), classified as a
beta2-adrenergic agonist. Serum/Plasma: The liquid portion of the
blood obtained after the removal of cells and clotting factors (for
serum) or cells alone (for plasma).
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Preferred/acceptable: Serum or plasma samples collected in a plain
red-top or EDTA (lavender-top) tube. Unacceptable: Hemolyzed,
lipemic, or icteric samples. Samples collected in sodium fluoride/
oxalate, sodium citrate, or heparinized tubes (other than plasma
samples collected in EDTA tubes if permitted) are also unacceptable.
Specimen Stability:
• Serum/plasma samples are stable for up to:
◦ 24 hours at room temperature (18-25°C).
◦ 48 hours when refrigerated (2-8°C).
◦ 2 months when frozen at -20°C.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
Equipment:
• High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) or LC-MS/MS
system.
• Centrifuge.
• Micropipettes and tips.
• Vortex mixer.
• Freezer (-20°C).
• Refrigerator (2-8°C).
Reagents:
• Albuterol standard solution.
• Mobile phase reagents (e.g., methanol, water, acetonitrile, formic
acid, etc.).
• Calibration and control materials at high, medium, and low
concentrations.
• Extraction solvent (if required).
1. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation
1. Allow all frozen samples to thaw at room temperature before
analysis.
2. Centrifuge blood samples within 2 hours of collection at 1500 g
for 10 minutes to separate serum/plasma.
3. Aliquot the clear supernatant into appropriate sample tubes for
analysis.
B. Calibration and Quality Control
1. Prepare a calibration curve using albuterol standard solutions at
multiple concentrations.
2. Include a minimum of three levels of quality control (QC)
samples (low, medium, and high concentration) in each run.
3. Perform calibration and QC material preparation according to
manufacturer's instructions.
C. Analytical Procedure
1. Set up the HPLC or LC-MS/MS system according to the
instrument's standard operating procedures.
2. Prepare the mobile phase and ensure it is degassed and
filtered prior to use.
3. Inject a blank sample to ensure system cleanliness and stability.
4. Perform instrument calibration using the prepared calibration
standards.
5. Inject control samples and patient samples into the HPLC or
LC-MS/MS system.
6. Monitor and record the response for albuterol in each sample,
ensuring that peak resolution and retention times are consistent
with established protocols.
D. Data Analysis
1. Generate a calibration curve by plotting the known
concentrations of the calibration standards against their
respective peak areas.
2. Quantify albuterol levels in patient samples by comparing their
peak areas to the calibration curve.
3. Review and validate the results of the QC samples to ensure
the run's accuracy and precision.
E. Reporting Results
1. Record the albuterol concentration for each patient sample in
the laboratory information system (LIS).
2. Ensure all results meet the established acceptance criteria
before releasing them.
3. Report any abnormal test results or deviations to the supervisor
immediately.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
Internal Quality Control:
1. Run three levels of QC samples with each batch of patient
samples (before, during, and after the run).
2. Plot QC data on control charts and review for trends or
deviations from acceptable limits.
3. Investigate and address any QC failures before reporting
patient results.
External Quality Control:
1. Participate in an external proficiency testing program for
albuterol measurement at least biannually.
2. Compare proficiency test results with peers and take corrective
actions as necessary.
3. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the instrument manual and reagent manufacturer's insert for
specific limitations related to the measurement of albuterol.
Environmental factors, specimen handling, and the presence of
interfering substances may affect test results.
