Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analysis of Aldolase in
Plasma
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedures to be followed for the accurate and reliable
analysis of Aldolase in plasma samples using the specified assay
method. This SOP is intended to ensure that all steps from sample
preparation to result generation are performed consistently and
correctly.
Responsibility:
• All designated laboratory personnel are responsible for following
this SOP.
• It is the responsibility of the laboratory supervisor to ensure that
all personnel are trained and compliant with this SOP.
1. DEFINITIONS
Aldolase: An enzyme that plays a role in glycolysis and
gluconeogenesis. Elevated serum aldolase levels may indicate
muscle or liver damage.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type:
• Preferred/acceptable: Plasma collected in heparinized tubes (dark
green or PST).
• Specimen should be centrifuged immediately after collection and
plasma separated.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Clotted specimens.
• Hemolyzed specimens (hemolysis can interfere with the assay).
• Specimens collected in EDTA, citrate, or fluoride tubes.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes and tips
• Aldolase Assay Kit (specify manufacturer and catalog number)
• Spectrophotometer or plate reader
• Laboratory timer
• Calibrated analytical balance
Reagents:
• Aldolase colorimetric reagent
• Reaction buffer
• Calibrators and controls
• Distilled or deionized water
Supplies:
• Plastic or glass vials
• Microcentrifuge tubes
• Gloves and other PPE
1. PROCEDURE
Specimen Handling and Preparation:
1. Upon receiving the plasma specimens, label them appropriately
with unique identifiers.
2. Store specimens at 2-8°C until ready for analysis. If analysis is
delayed for more than 48 hours, freeze samples at -20°C or
below.
3. Thaw frozen specimens to room temperature before use and
mix gently to ensure homogeneity.
Reagent Preparation: 4. Prepare the Aldolase colorimetric reagent
and reaction buffer as per the manufacturer’s instructions. 5. Allow all
reagents and specimens to reach room temperature before beginning
the assay.
Assay Procedure: 6. Pipette the appropriate volume of reaction buffer
into the reaction wells or cuvettes. 7. Add the plasma samples,
calibrators, and controls in specified volumes into the designated
wells or cuvettes. 8. Add the Aldolase colorimetric reagent to each
well or cuvette and mix the contents gently. 9. Incubate the reaction
mixture at the specified temperature (typically 37°C) for the time
specified by the assay kit manufacturer.
Measurement: 10. Measure the absorbance of each reaction well or
cuvette at the wavelength specified by the assay kit manufacturer
using a spectrophotometer or plate reader.
Calculations: 11. Generate a standard curve using the absorbance
values of the calibrators. 12. Calculate the Aldolase concentration in
the plasma samples using the standard curve and appropriate
software or manual calculation method.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
2. Analyze quality control (QC) samples with each batch of patient
specimens to ensure the accuracy and precision of the assay.
3. Use both high and low concentration QC samples. Results
should fall within the established ranges.
4. If QC results fall outside the acceptable range, investigate and
troubleshoot the issue before proceeding with patient sample
analysis.
5. REPORTING RESULTS
6. Document the Aldolase concentration for each sample in the
laboratory information system (LIS).
7. Review and verify all results before release. Ensure that any
flags or questionable results are addressed according to
laboratory protocol.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
9. Hemolyzed specimens may give falsely elevated results and
should be rejected.
10. Incorrect storage or prolonged storage of specimens may lead
to degradation of Aldolase and erroneous results.
11. REFERENCES
12. Manufacturer’s package insert for the Aldolase Assay Kit.
13. Relevant clinical biochemistry literature and test validation
studies.
By following this SOP, laboratory personnel will ensure the accurate
and consistent analysis of Aldolase levels in plasma samples,
providing reliable results for clinical decision-making.
