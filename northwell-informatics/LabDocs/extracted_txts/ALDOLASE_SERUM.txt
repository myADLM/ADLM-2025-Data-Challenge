Standard Operating Procedure
(SOP) for Analytical Phase:
ALDOLASE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this SOP is to outline the analytical
procedures for the quantification of serum aldolase levels. Serum
aldolase is an enzyme that catalyzes the reversible cleavage of
fructose-1,6-bisphosphate to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and
dihydroxyacetone phosphate. This procedure ensures accurate,
precise, and reliable results in the clinical laboratory.
2. SCOPE This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel involved in
processing and analyzing serum aldolase levels using the designated
analytical procedures and instruments in a CLIA-certified laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• It is the responsibility of the designated staff to perform the
analytical procedure as described.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring all personnel are trained
and competent in this procedure.
• All personnel must bring any issues or deviations from the
protocol to the attention of the supervisor immediately.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Type: Serum.
• Collection: Serum should be collected using SST (serum
separator tube) or red-top tubes.
• Volume: A minimum volume of 1 mL of serum is required.
• Stability:
◦ Room Temperature: Stable for up to 8 hours.
◦ Refrigerated (2-8°C): Stable for up to 72 hours.
◦ Frozen (-20°C or lower): Stable for up to one month.
• Unacceptable Specimens: Hemolyzed samples and specimens
with insufficient volume.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Analytical instrument: Spectrophotometer or automated
biochemical analyzer.
• Aldolase reagents: Substrate, buffer, coenzyme (NADH), and
other necessary reagents as specified by the manufacturer.
• Calibrators and control materials: Low, normal, and high
concentration controls.
• Pipettes and tips.
• Vortex mixer.
• Centrifuge (if not using SST).
• Timer.
6. PROCEDURE Preparation:
1. Prepare all reagents according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
2. Allow reagents, calibrators, and controls to reach room
temperature before use.
3. Ensure that the spectrophotometer or biochemical analyzer is
calibrated and performing according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
Sample Preparation:
1. Centrifuge the serum at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes if SST was not
used.
2. Aliquot the required volume of clear serum (usually 100 µL) for
analysis.
Running the Assay:
1. Blank Measurement:
◦ Prepare a cuvette or analyzer-specific container with all
reagents except the serum sample.
◦ Measure the absorbance at the specified wavelength
(typically 340 nm) to obtain the blank.
2. Sample Measurement:
◦ Add the serum sample to the reagent mixture according to
the test kit instructions.
◦ Mix gently and incubate at room temperature for the
specified time (usually 10 minutes).
◦ Measure the absorbance at 340 nm.
3. Control and Calibrator Measurement:
◦ Run controls and calibrators in the same manner as patient
samples.
◦ Ensure all controls fall within the manufacturer-specified
ranges before proceeding to report patient results.
Quality Control:
1. Run two levels of quality control (low and high) at the beginning
of each shift and whenever a new lot of reagents is introduced.
2. Document the control results in the quality control log.
3. If controls are out of range, troubleshoot according to the
manufacturer's instructions and do not report patient results
until the issue is resolved.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
• Reference Range: 1.0 to 7.5 U/L (varies by laboratory; refer to
local reference ranges).
• Record the results in the laboratory information system (LIS).
• Verify results against reference ranges and flag abnormal values
as necessary.
• Document any issues or deviations from the SOP during analysis
in the logbook.
8. MAINTENANCE AND TROUBLESHOOTING
• Perform routine maintenance of the analytical instrument per the
manufacturer's instructions.
• Document any errors, troubleshooting steps, and corrective
actions taken in the instrument logbook.
9. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS
• Handle all specimens as biohazardous material.
• Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) including
lab coat, gloves, and safety glasses.
• Dispose of all waste according to biohazard disposal protocols.
10. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instruction manual for the aldolase assay kit.
• Laboratory's internal quality control and maintenance logs.
• CLSI Guidelines.
This SOP ensures consistent and reliable measurement of aldolase
levels in serum samples, supporting accurate diagnosis and patient
care. All personnel must strictly adhere to the outlined procedure to
maintain high standards of laboratory practice.
