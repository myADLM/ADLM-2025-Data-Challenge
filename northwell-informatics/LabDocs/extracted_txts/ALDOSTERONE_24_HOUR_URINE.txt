Protocol for Analyzing Aldosterone in 24-Hour Urine Samples
1. Purpose: To provide standardized procedures for the analysis of
aldosterone levels in 24-hour urine specimens to ensure accurate
and reliable test results.
2. Responsibility: Designated laboratory technologists are
responsible for conducting the analytical procedures following this
protocol. All staff members are required to report any deviations from
the protocol to the supervisor.
3. Specimen:
• Collection: Patients should collect all urine voided over a 24-hour
period in a provided container. The container should contain a
preservative if specified.
• Storage and Transport: Upon completion, the specimen should
be mixed thoroughly and stored under refrigeration if not
immediately analyzed. The specimen must be transported to the
laboratory as soon as possible, maintaining a cold chain of 2-8°C.
4. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies:
• Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)
or an equivalent validated method for aldosterone analysis.
• Calibrators and controls at various concentration levels that cover
the expected range of aldosterone.
• Internal standards, reagents, buffers, and solvents for sample
preparation and analysis.
• 24-hour urine collection containers.
5. Procedure:
A. Pre-Analytical Preparation:
1. Check Specimen Validity:
◦ Confirm that the 24-hour urine specimen is complete and
within the acceptable volume (typically 2-4 liters) range.
◦ Verify that the specimen has been stored appropriately
(refrigerated) if analysis is not performed immediately.
◦ Ensure that specimen labels include patient identification
and collection times.
2. Preparation of Sample:
◦ Measure the total volume of the 24-hour collection. Record
the volume, ensuring it is noted on the sample requisition
form.
◦ Mix the specimen thoroughly by shaking the container to
ensure homogeneity.
3. Internal Standard Addition:
◦ Pipette a specified volume (e.g., 10 mL) of the urine sample
into a clean tube.
◦ Add a known quantity of internal standard to each sample to
monitor for recovery and matrix effects.
B. Analytical Phase:
1. Sample Extraction:
◦ Employ an appropriate method (e.g., solid phase extraction)
to purify aldosterone from the urine matrix.
◦ Follow the standard operating procedure for the chosen
extraction method.
2. Calibration and Quality Control:
◦ Prepare the calibration curve by serially diluting the
calibrators to cover the anticipated concentration range of
aldosterone.
◦ Run quality control samples at low, medium, and high
concentrations along with patient samples to verify the
assay's accuracy and precision.
3. Chromatographic Analysis:
◦ Inject an aliquot of the purified sample onto the column of
the LC-MS/MS instrument.
◦ Use pre-determined chromatographic conditions to separate
aldosterone from other components.
◦ Ensure proper settings and parameters for the mass
spectrometry detection of aldosterone and internal standard.
4. Data Acquisition and Processing:
◦ Collect data as the samples are analyzed through the mass
spectrometer.
◦ Use the software provided with the LC-MS/MS system to
quantitate aldosterone levels using the calibration curve
generated.
C. Post-Analytical Phase:
1. Result Calculation:
◦ Convert the concentration of aldosterone found in the
aliquoted sample back to the total 24-hour urine volume
(e.g., ng/24 hours).
◦ Ensure calculations account for dilution factors and the total
urine volume collected over 24 hours.
2. Quality Control Review:
◦ Review control sample results to ensure they fall within
acceptable ranges before reporting patient results.
◦ Recalibrate and reanalyze if control samples fall outside
acceptable ranges.
3. Reporting Results:
◦ Enter the final results into the laboratory information system
(LIS), ensuring all relevant patient and test information is
complete.
◦ Note any deviations, comments, or special instructions
related to the test or specimen.
4. Documentation:
◦ Maintain thorough records of all analytical steps, including
calibration curves, control results, patient results, and any
corrective actions taken.
◦ Ensure that all documentation is stored following the
laboratory’s standard operating procedures and regulatory
requirements.

guidelines.
• Manufacturer's instructions for the LC-MS/MS instrument and
software.

by relevant regulatory agencies and laboratory accrediting bodies.
Note: This protocol must comply with the most current version of
regulatory and manufacturer guidelines. Regular review and updates
are essential to maintain accuracy and compliance.
