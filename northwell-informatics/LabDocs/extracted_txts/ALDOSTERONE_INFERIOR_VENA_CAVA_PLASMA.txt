Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Aldosterone, Inferior Vena Cava, Plasma
1. PURPOSE
To outline the analytical procedures for obtaining accurate and
reliable lab results for Aldosterone levels in plasma samples collected
from the inferior vena cava (IVC).
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of the laboratory staff to execute the procedures
as outlined and ensure the integrity and accuracy of the test results.
Supervisors are responsible for overseeing the process and ensuring
that the procedures are followed and documented correctly.
1. DEFINITION
Aldosterone is a hormone that plays a critical role in the regulation of
blood pressure and electrolyte balance. This procedure is specific to
measuring Aldosterone levels in plasma obtained from the inferior
vena cava.
1. MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT
• Centrifuge
• Plasma separation tubes (EDTA)
• Refrigerated storage (2-8°C)
• Aldosterone Assay Kit (e.g., ELISA)
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Incubator (set at 37°C)
• Microplate reader
• Labelling and recording materials
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
• Quality control materials
1. SPECIMEN PROCESSING
4.1. Acceptable Specimen:
• Volume: 3-5 mL of plasma
• Type: Plasma collected in EDTA tubes
• Collection site: Inferior vena cava
• Storage: Specimens should be kept refrigerated (2-8°C) and
should be analyzed within 24 hours of collection.
4.2. Unacceptable Specimen:
• Specimens that are hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric.
• Specimens not stored as recommended.
• Specimens with insufficient volume.
1. PROCEDURE
5.1. Plasma Separation:
1. Centrifuge the blood sample at 1500-2000x g for 10-15 minutes
at 4°C within an hour of collection.
2. Carefully transfer the plasma into a clean, labelled storage tube
without disturbing the buffy coat or red cells.
3. Store the plasma at 2-8°C until analysis.
5.2. Preparation for Aldosterone Assay:
1. Allow Aldosterone Assay Kit and samples to equilibrate to room
temperature (~22°C) before use.
2. Set up and calibrate the microplate reader according to the
manufacturer's instructions provided with the Aldosterone Assay
Kit.
5.3. Performing the Aldosterone Assay (ELISA):
1. Prepare all reagents, standards, and quality control samples as
outlined in the kit’s instruction manual.
2. Pipette the appropriate volume of plasma samples, quality
controls, and standards into designated wells on the microplate.
3. Add the provided enzyme conjugate and substrate to each well
following the kit’s protocol.
4. Incubate the microplate in an incubator set at 37°C for the time
specified by the manufacturer.
5. Stop the reaction by adding the stop solution. Measure the
absorbance of each well using a microplate reader at the
recommended wavelength.
5.4. Calculation and Validation:
1. Determine the concentration of Aldosterone in the plasma
samples by referencing the standard curve generated from the
standards.
2. Ensure that all quality control specimens fall within the
accepted range. Document any deviations and perform
corrective actions if necessary.
3. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results will be automatically transmitted to the Laboratory
Information System (LIS) for review.
• Results must be verified by a technologist and documented in the
LIS.
• Report any critical values according to the laboratory’s protocol for
handling critical results.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Use control materials with known Aldosterone concentrations to
validate assay performance.
• Perform quality control at the beginning of each assay run and
after any kit or reagent change.
• Document all quality control activities, results, and any corrective
actions taken.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to the Aldosterone Assay Kit insert for limitations specific to
the assay employed.
• Recognize that high levels of hemolysis, lipemia, or icterus may
affect the accuracy of results.
1. SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS
• Follow all laboratory safety protocols.
• Always use proper PPE, including gloves, lab coat, and face
protection when handling specimens and reagents.
• Dispose of biohazard waste according to institutional guidelines.
