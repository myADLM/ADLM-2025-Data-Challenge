Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase:
Aldosterone, Inferior Vena Cava, Serum
1. PURPOSE
To ensure accurate and precise measurement of serum aldosterone
levels in specimens drawn from the inferior vena cava. The
procedure outlines the methodology, instrumentation, quality control,
and documentation requirements for generating reliable aldosterone
results.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all personnel involved in the analysis of serum
aldosterone collected from the inferior vena cava and ensures
consistency in processing, analysis, and reporting.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Technologists/Laboratory staff are responsible for following the
procedure and ensuring proper documentation.
• Supervisors are responsible for reviewing results, ensuring
compliance with the procedure, and maintaining quality control.
4. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
• Centrifuge
• Refrigerated centrifuge (for serum separation)
• Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)
or chemiluminescent immunoassay analyzer
• Centrifuge tubes
• Pipettes and tips
• Calibrated micropipettes
• Serum aldosterone control materials (commercially available)
• Laboratory Information System (LIS)
5. REAGENTS
• Calibrators and standards for aldosterone
• Quality control (QC) materials (high, medium, and low
concentration levels)
• Sample diluent
• Wash buffer
• Substrate
• Elution solvents (for LC-MS/MS)
6. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type: Serum collected from the inferior vena cava.
Collection Tubes:
• Red-top tube (without anticoagulant)
Specimen Handling:
• After collection, allow the blood to clot for 30 minutes.
• Centrifuge at 1500 x g for 10 minutes at 4°C to separate serum.
• Aliquot the serum into labeled tubes and store at 2-8°C if analysis
is performed within 24 hours; freeze at -20°C for longer storage.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric specimens.
• Specimens not properly labeled with collection time and patient
information.
• Specimens stored at inappropriate temperatures.
7. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation of Calibrators and Controls:
1. Prepare calibrators and QC materials according to
manufacturer's instructions.
2. Ensure concentrations cover the entire range of expected
results.
B) Instrument Calibration:
1. Calibrate the instrument following the manufacturer’s
guidelines.
2. Run a series of calibrators and plot a standard curve.
3. Ensure the correlation coefficient (R²) is ≥0.995 for the
calibration curve.
C) Sample Preparation:
1. Thaw frozen serum samples at room temperature and mix by
gentle inversion.
2. Pipette the required volume of serum into a sample vial/tube.
D) Analytical Measurement: Using LC-MS/MS:
1. Add appropriate internal standard to each sample.
2. Perform protein precipitation or another suitable extraction
method.
3. Inject the extracted sample into the LC-MS/MS system.
4. Follow the specific instrument protocol for running and
analyzing samples.
Using Chemiluminescent Immunoassay:
1. Pipette the sample into the designated well of the assay kit.
2. Add the assay reagents sequentially as per manufacturer’s
instructions.
3. Incubate and wash the wells as specified.
4. Measure the chemiluminescence activity using the analyzer.
E) Quality Control:
1. Include a set of QC samples (high, medium, low) in each
analytical run.
2. Verify that the QC results fall within the established acceptable
range.
F) Data Analysis:
1. Review and interpret the data generated by the instrument.
2. Compare the sample results against the standard curve.
3. Ensure quality control results are within acceptable limits before
accepting patient results.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Document all analytical data and QC results in the laboratory
information system (LIS).
2. Verify results and review for any potential issues or errors.
3. Release results to the clinician, ensuring that any abnormal or
critical values are communicated immediately.
9. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Consult relevant clinical guidelines or institution-specific reference
ranges for serum aldosterone levels.
10. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Run quality control samples at the beginning of each shift and
with every batch of patient specimens.
2. Document and review control results daily.
3. Conduct instrument maintenance according to the schedule
and document all actions.
11. TROUBLESHOOTING
• Address any out-of-range quality control results by rerunning the
assay or preparing a fresh batch of controls.
• Consult instrument manuals for specific error codes.
• Notify the supervisor of persistent issues.
12. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions for LC-MS/MS or chemiluminescent
immunoassay analyzer.
• Relevant clinical laboratory guidelines for aldosterone testing.
13. REVISION HISTORY
• Document any updates or changes to the procedure with dates
and reasons for revisions.
This SOP ensures standardized procedures for aldosterone analysis
from serum samples drawn from the inferior vena cava, ensuring
accuracy and reliability in clinical diagnostics.
