Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for ALDOSTERONE, LEFT ADRENAL VEIN,
PLASMA
1. PURPOSE
To ensure accurate and precise measurement of aldosterone levels
in left adrenal vein plasma samples. This procedure outlines the
steps for the sample preparation, assay conduct, data analysis, and
result reporting.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing the
assay, recording data, and ensuring the integrity of the analytical
procedure. Supervisors are responsible for overseeing the process
and validating the final results.
3. SPECIMENS
3.1. Acceptable Specimens:
• Plasma samples collected from the left adrenal vein using EDTA
or heparinized tubes.
• Samples must be centrifuged immediately after collection to
separate plasma.
• Plasma should be frozen at -20°C or colder if analysis is not
performed immediately, and should be protected from light.
3.2. Unacceptable Specimens:
• Samples with visible hemolysis, lipemia, or icterus.
• Samples not processed or stored as per the specified guidelines.
4. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
4.1. Equipment:
• Centrifuge
• Refrigerated storage (-20°C or colder)
• High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) or Liquid
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)
• Pipettes and tips
• Vortex mixer
• Analytical balance
• Standard laboratory glassware
4.2. Reagents:
• Aldosterone ELISA kit or LC-MS/MS reagents
• Calibration standards and quality controls
• Internal standard (for LC-MS/MS)
• Mobile phase solvents (HPLC/LC-MS grade)
5. PROCEDURE
5.1. Preparation of Reagents and Standards
5.1.1. Prepare all reagents and calibration standards as per the
manufacturer's instructions. 5.1.2. Bring all reagents to room
temperature before use.
5.2. Sample Preparation
5.2.1. Thaw plasma samples at room temperature and vortex to mix
well. 5.2.2. Centrifuge at 1500 x g for 10 minutes at 4°C to remove
any particulates. 5.2.3. Aliquot a required volume of plasma into a
clean labeled microcentrifuge tube.
5.3. Assay Procedure
For ELISA:
5.3.1. Add appropriate volumes of plasma samples, calibration
standards, and quality controls to the designated wells on the ELISA
plate. 5.3.2. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for the addition of
reagents, incubation times, and washing steps. 5.3.3. Read
absorbance at the specified wavelength using a microplate reader.
For LC-MS/MS:
5.3.4. Prepare samples by adding an internal standard and
performing necessary extraction steps (solid-phase or liquid-liquid
extraction). 5.3.5. Evaporate and reconstitute the samples in the
mobile phase. 5.3.6. Inject the sample onto the LC-MS/MS system.
5.3.7. Analyze using the specified chromatographic and mass
spectrometric conditions.
5.4. Calibration and Quality Control
5.4.1. Run calibration standards and quality controls with each batch
of samples. 5.4.2. Ensure that the calibration curve has at least 5
points and that quality controls fall within the acceptable range.
6. CALCULATIONS AND REPORTING
6.1. For ELISA:
6.1.1. Plot the standard curve and determine the concentration of
aldosterone in the samples using the absorbance values.
6.2. For LC-MS/MS:
6.2.1. Generate a calibration curve by plotting the peak area ratios of
the analyte to the internal standard against the concentration of the
standards. 6.2.2. Calculate the concentration of aldosterone in the
samples from the calibration curve.
6.3. Reporting
6.3.1. Report results using the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
6.3.2. Include details such as sample identification, analytical method
used, date of analysis, and initials of the technologist.
7. QUALITY CONTROL AND TROUBLESHOOTING
7.1. Run quality controls and calibration standards with each batch to
ensure the accuracy and precision of the assay. 7.2. If results fall
outside the expected range, reanalyze the sample and review all
steps to identify potential issues. 7.3. Regularly maintain and
calibrate the equipment as per manufacturer’s recommendations.
8. REFERENCE RANGES
Normal reference ranges should be provided based on validated,
peer-reviewed studies or internal validation data specific to the lab.
9. REFERENCES
Include references to the manufacturer's guidelines, relevant peer-
reviewed articles, and standard guidelines (e.g., Clinical Laboratory
Standards Institute (CLSI)).
10. DOCUMENTATION AND STORAGE
Maintain all records, including calibration curves, quality control data,
and final reports, for at least 2 years.
11. APPENDICES
Supply any standard operating forms or logs included in the
analytical process such as the Temperature Monitoring Log,
Calibration Log, Quality Control Log, etc.
