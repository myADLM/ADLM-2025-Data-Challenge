Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for ALDOSTERONE, LEFT
ADRENAL VEIN, SERUM
1. PURPOSE To outline the procedures for the quantitative
analysis of aldosterone in serum obtained from the left adrenal
vein to ensure accurate and reliable results for clinical
interpretation.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing
aldosterone analysis according to this documented procedure.
• Laboratory supervisors are responsible for ensuring that proper
procedures are followed, including any corrective actions that may
be required.
1. DEFINITION Aldosterone is a steroid hormone produced by the
adrenal glands, essential for regulating sodium and potassium
levels in the blood. The test is particularly crucial for evaluating
adrenal gland function and diagnosing conditions such as
primary aldosteronism.
Specimen: Serum obtained from the left adrenal vein.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Centrifuge
• Refrigerated storage units (2-8°C)
• Aldosterone assay kit (e.g., ELISA, chemiluminescence, or mass
spectrometry)
• Pipettes and tips
• Test tubes and microcentrifuge tubes
• Refrigerated centrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Micropipettes
• Volumetric flasks
• Timer
• Quality control materials, including positive and negative controls
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY Preferred
Specimen: Serum collected from the left adrenal vein, kept on
ice, and delivered to the laboratory within 30 minutes of
collection. Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens received more than 30 minutes after collection.
• Specimens with hemolysis or excessive lipemia.
• Specimens collected in inappropriate containers.
Note: If the specimen has been refrigerated, bring it to room
temperature prior to analysis.
1. PROCEDURE
Specimen Handling:
• Upon receipt, verify the integrity of the sample, ensuring it
matches the requisition form with proper labeling.
• If the specimen is not immediately processed, store it in a
refrigerated unit (2-8°C).
Preparation:
• Allow the sample to equilibrate to room temperature.
• Centrifuge the specimen at 1500xg for 10 minutes to separate
serum from other components.
• Carefully transfer the serum into a clean, labeled microcentrifuge
tube.
Analysis:
• Follow the specific procedure outlined in the aldosterone assay kit
insert, which typically includes the following steps:
1. Set up the plate with standards, controls, and patient
samples in appropriate wells.
2. Add primary antibody specific to aldosterone to each well
and incubate as instructed.
3. Wash wells to remove unbound antibodies.
4. Add secondary antibody conjugated to a detection enzyme
and incubate.
5. Wash wells to remove unbound secondary antibody.
6. Add substrate solution to wells and incubate for the defined
period.
7. Measure optical density (OD) or luminescence using a
microplate reader.
Quality Control:
• Run positive and negative controls alongside patient specimens
to ensure assay validity.
• If QC results fall outside acceptable limits, investigate and resolve
before reporting patient results.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results are automatically transmitted to the Laboratory
Information System (LIS) and must be reviewed and verified by
the technologist.
• Refer to site-specific reporting guidelines for result interpretation
and documentation.
Critical Values:
• Report critical results immediately to the ordering physician as per
laboratory policy.
• Document all communications related to critical results in the LIS.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to the assay kit insert for specific limitations, including
potential interference from certain medications, sample handling
errors, or extreme hemolysis.
