Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase Protocol for Generating Results for
Aldosterone, Plasma
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to define the procedure for the analytical
phase of generating results for Aldosterone testing in plasma
specimens in our CLIA-certified laboratory.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory staff are responsible for
following this procedure to ensure accurate and reliable results.
1. DEFINITION
Aldosterone is a steroid hormone produced by the adrenal glands,
which plays a key role in regulating blood pressure and the balance
of electrolytes. Monitoring aldosterone levels can help in diagnosing
and managing conditions such as hyperaldosteronism and Addison’s
disease.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred Specimen:
• 4 mL of EDTA plasma.
Specimen Collection:
• Collect blood via venipuncture in an EDTA tube.
• Ensure proper labeling with patient identification, collection date,
and time.
• Centrifuge the blood sample at 1500 g for 10 minutes at 4°C.
• Aliquot plasma into a secondary tube and label appropriately.
Specimen Stability:
• Room temperature: 24 hours.
• Refrigerated (2-8°C): 7 days.
• Frozen (-20°C or lower): 3 months.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens with hemolysis, lipemia, or an indication of improper
handling or labeling.
• Specimens in tubes other than EDTA.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes
• Analytical balance
• Spectrophotometer or immunoassay analyzer
Reagents:
• Aldosterone extraction reagent
• Aldosterone assay kit
• QC materials for Aldosterone assay
Supplies:
• EDTA collection tubes
• Secondary aliquot tubes
• Calibration standards
• Gloves and personal protective equipment (PPE)
1. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Handling:
• Verify specimen integrity and proper labeling.
• Ensure plasma is clear and free from hemolysis and lipemia.
• If specimen is frozen, thaw at room temperature and mix gently
before analysis.
B. Assay Preparation:
• Set up the assay workspace using appropriate PPE.
• Prepare and calibrate the immunoassay analyzer or
spectrophotometer according to manufacturer instructions.
• Prepare reagents and standards as specified in the assay kit
instructions.
C. Analytical Process:
1. Pipette designated volumes of plasma into the assay wells.
2. Follow the Aldosterone assay kit protocol for sample addition,
incubation, washing, and detection.
3. Start timer according to assay instructions.
4. Perform data collection using the analyzer.
D. Quality Control:
• Run QC samples alongside patient specimens to ensure assay
accuracy.
• Verify that QC results fall within acceptable ranges as defined by
the manufacturer.
• If QC fails, troubleshoot according to the manufacturer's guide
and repeat the assay.
E. Data Analysis and Reporting:
• Analyze the collected data.
• Apply necessary correction factors.
• Verify results for plausibility and accuracy.
• Enter data into LIS for automatic transmission to EPIC.
• Review and verify results before final reporting.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
Reporting Guidelines:
• Results are reviewed and verified by the technologist before LIS
entry.
• Follow site-specific guidelines for result interpretation.
• Flag critical values according to established laboratory protocols
for Aldosterone.
Reference Intervals:
• Normal range for plasma Aldosterone is 4-31 ng/dL (data should
be specific to laboratory standards or defined in the kit insert).
Critical Values:
• Flag and report results of potential clinical urgency, with
immediate notification to ordering physician as required.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to Aldosterone assay kit insert for potential interferences
and limitations specific to the assay.
• Assure that no interfering substances, like certain medications or
technical errors (e.g. incorrect specimen handling), affect results.
