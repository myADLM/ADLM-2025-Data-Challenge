Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase Protocol for Generating Results for
Aldosterone, Right Adrenal Vein, Plasma
1. PURPOSE To establish standard procedures for processing,
analyzing, and generating accurate results for aldosterone
levels in plasma specimens obtained from the right adrenal
vein.
2. SCOPE This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel trained on
and authorized to perform aldosterone assays in a CLIA-
certified laboratory. This protocol must be followed to ensure
consistency, accuracy, and quality control in aldosterone
testing.
3. RESPONSIBILITY Trained laboratory personnel are
responsible for performing the aldosterone assay as described
in this SOP. The supervising technologist is responsible for
reviewing results, ensuring QC compliance, and documenting
any corrective actions taken.
4. DEFINITION Aldosterone: A hormone produced by the adrenal
glands that helps regulate blood pressure by controlling the
balance of potassium and sodium in the blood.
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
5.1 Specimen Type: - Plasma collected from the right adrenal vein
using appropriate blood collection systems.
5.2 Preferred/Acceptable: - Use a heparinized collection tube (dark
green) to avoid clot formation.
5.3 Unacceptable: - Specimens collected in tubes containing EDTA,
citrate, or oxalate. - Hemolyzed samples or those visibly
contaminated. - Specimens not properly labeled with collection time
and patient identifiers.
5.4 Stability: - Plasma specimens should be processed and stored at
2-8°C. - If analysis is not performed immediately, specimens can be
frozen at -20°C for up to one month. Avoid repeated freeze-thaw
cycles.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
◦ Centrifuge
◦ Pipettes and pipette tips
◦ Aldosterone assay kit (e.g., ELISA or LC-MS/MS)
◦ Reagent grade water
◦ Control plasma samples (expected low and high
aldosterone concentration)
◦ Specimen vials and labels
◦ Laboratory timer
2. PROCEDURE
7.1 Specimen Processing: a. Centrifuge the heparinized plasma
collection tube at 1500 x g for 10 minutes at 4°C to separate plasma.
b. Carefully aliquot the clear plasma to a clean specimen vial,
avoiding the buffy coat and red cells. c. Label the aliquot vial with the
patient identifier, collection site (right adrenal vein), and date/time of
collection.
7.2 Assay Preparation: a. Bring all reagents and specimens to room
temperature before starting the assay. b. Prepare standards, controls,
and reagents as instructed in the aldosterone assay kit insert. c.
Ensure all QC measures are in place for control verification.
7.3 Assay Procedure (ELISA): a. Pipette the required volume of
standards, controls, and specimens into the appropriate wells of the
microtiter plate. b. Add assay reagents (e.g., enzyme conjugate) to
each well as specified in the kit instructions. c. Incubate the plate
according to the assay protocol. d. Wash the wells with wash buffer
as specified. e. Add substrate solution and incubate for the specified
time. f. Stop the reaction by adding stop solution to each well. g.
Read the absorbance at the designated wavelength within the
specified time.
7.4 Assay Procedure (LC-MS/MS): a. Prepare calibration standards
and quality control samples as per the standard protocol. b. Extract
aldosterone from the plasma samples using the appropriate
extraction technique (e.g., solid-phase extraction). c. Load the
extracted samples into the LC-MS/MS system. d. Run the LC-MS/MS
method for aldosterone analysis as per the validated protocol. e.
Analyze data and quantify aldosterone levels using the calibration
curve.
7.5 Quality Control: a. Include at least two levels of control samples
(low and high) with each batch of patient samples. b. Accept or reject
the batch based on the control results falling within the established
QC limits. c. Document all QC checks and any corrective actions
taken in the QC log.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ Review results from the assay and ensure they meet all
quality control criteria.
◦ Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
and verify by the technologist.
◦ Report results to the requesting clinician following site-
specific reporting guidelines.
2. REFERENCES
◦ Aldosterone Assay Kit Insert
◦ Manufacturer's Instructions for Use (IFU) for specific
equipment (ELISA reader, LC-MS/MS)
◦ CLIA regulations and guidelines for clinical laboratory testing
3. DOCUMENTATION
◦ Maintain a log of all specimens processed, including patient
ID, collection time, and results.
◦ Document quality control checks, any deviations from the
protocol, and corrective actions in the appropriate logbooks.
