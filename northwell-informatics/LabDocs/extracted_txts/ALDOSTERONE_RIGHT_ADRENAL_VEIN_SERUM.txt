SOP: Analytical Phase Protocol for Generating Results for
ALDOSTERONE, RIGHT ADRENAL VEIN, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
To outline the standardized procedure for the generation of results for
aldosterone levels in serum collected from the right adrenal vein to
ensure accurate and reliable results.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory personnel to follow
this SOP to ensure proper handling, analysis, and documentation of
results for aldosterone, right adrenal vein, serum.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/acceptable:
• Serum samples obtained directly from the right adrenal vein
through venipuncture by a qualified healthcare professional.
• Specimen should be collected in a serum separator tube (SST) or
a plain red-top tube.
Unacceptable:
• Specimens collected in heparinized, EDTA-containing, or citrate-
containing tubes.
Stability:
• Serum samples must be processed and analyzed within 2 hours
of collection.
• If storage is required, specimens should be refrigerated at 2-8°C
and must be analyzed within 48 hours.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Centrifuge (for serum separation)
• Refrigerated storage unit (2-8°C)
• Aldosterone assay kit (specified vendor and lot number; assure
non-expired)
• Calibrators and controls specific to the aldosterone assay
• Automated or manual immunoassay analyzer
• Appropriate PPE (gloves, lab coat, etc.)
• Timer
• Micropipettes and tips
1. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Wear appropriate PPE.
2. Ensure the serum aldosterone assay kit and reagents are at
room temperature and within the expiration date.
3. Verify that all equipment and tools, including the centrifuge and
immunoassay analyzer, are calibrated and functional.
Sample Handling:
1. Immediately upon specimen receipt, label samples accurately
and record time of collection.
2. Centrifuge the specimen at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes to
separate serum.
3. Transfer the serum to a labelled secondary container, if
applicable.
Reagent Preparation:
1. Prepare reagents according to the manufacturer's instruction
specified in the aldosterone assay kit.
Assay Procedure:
1. Prepare calibrators, controls, and serum samples according to
manufacturer instructions.
2. Load the serum samples, along with calibrators and controls,
onto the immunoassay analyzer.
3. Follow the specific steps for the automated immunoassay
procedure as per the manufacturer's instructions.
◦ For manual assays, pipette serum, reagents, and substrates
as directed, incubate for the specified times, and measure
the absorbance or luminescence.
Quality Control:
1. Run appropriate quality control samples with each batch of
patient samples.
2. Ensure that QC results fall within the acceptable range. If QC
fails, troubleshoot per manufacturer guidelines and rerun the
QC samples.
3. Document all QC data thoroughly.
Result Calculation:
1. The analyzer will automatically calculate aldosterone
concentration in serum. For manual assays, calculate results
using the provided formula or software tools.
2. Verify the results against the calibration curve.
Review & Verification:
1. Review results for any anomalies or outliers.
2. Confirm all results that fall outside reference ranges with a
retest, if necessary.
3. Document all findings in the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
Reporting:
1. Transmit verified results to the LIS.
2. Ensure results are reviewed and validated by a qualified
technologist before releasing to the physician/end-user.
3. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Reference intervals for aldosterone in serum will be established
through comparative studies or manufacturer's guidelines
(typically provided in the assay kit insert).
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Follow QC procedures strictly as described in the aldosterone
assay kit insert.
• Perform regular instrument calibration and maintenance.
• Conduct a patient sample comparison as outlined for new lot
validation and instrument cross-validation.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to the assay kit insert for specific limitations related to
reagent stability, specimen interference, and cross-reactivity
factors.
• High lipid, hemolytic or icteric samples may affect the assay
performance.
