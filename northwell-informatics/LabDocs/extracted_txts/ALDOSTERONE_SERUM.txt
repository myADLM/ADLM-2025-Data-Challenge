Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Aldosterone, Serum Testing
1. PURPOSE
To ensure accurate and precise determination of aldosterone levels
in serum samples within the clinical laboratory setting.
Responsibility:
Laboratory technologists are responsible for performing the
aldosterone assay according to this SOP and the manufacturer's
instructions. Laboratory supervisors are responsible for overseeing
the process and troubleshooting any issues affecting test results. It is
the responsibility of all staff to perform quality control checks and
maintain detailed documentation.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND HANDLING
a. Preferred Specimen:
• Serum from a red-top tube or serum separator tube (SST).
b. Collection and Handling:
• Ensure proper patient preparation: samples should ideally be
drawn in the morning after the patient has been seated or
recumbent for at least 30 minutes.
• Allow blood to clot at room temperature for 30 minutes, then
centrifuge for 10 minutes at 1800 x g.
• Transfer the serum immediately to plastic storage tubes.
• Samples should be refrigerated promptly at 2-8°C if not analyzed
immediately.
• Frozen samples (-20°C or lower) are acceptable but must be
thoroughly mixed after thawing and before testing.
c. Unacceptable Specimen:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or grossly icteric samples.
• Samples collected in tubes containing anticoagulants (e.g., EDTA,
heparin).
• Samples that have been at room temperature longer than 2 hours
before separation and storage.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Primary Equipment:
• Immunoassay analyzer or mass spectrometer as per
manufacturer’s instructions.
• Centrifuge.
• Refrigerated storage and freezer units.
• Calibrated pipettes.
Reagents and Controls:
• Aldosterone Reagent Kit (as per manufacturer’s instructions).
• Quality control materials: commercially available or laboratory-
prepared, calibrated to the assay system.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
a. The lab must run two levels of control (low and high) to properly
monitor the assay performance. b. Controls are to be run at the
beginning of each shift cycle, after any maintenance or calibration of
the instrument, and after troubleshooting any problems. c. Assess
control measures against established acceptable ranges. Only
proceed with patient sample testing if control results are within these
ranges. d. Document all control results in the quality control log.
1. PROCEDURE
a. Calibration:
• Calibrate the instrument as per the manufacturer’s guidelines
using calibrators provided in the reagent kit.
• Ensure all calibration results are within acceptable ranges before
proceeding.
b. Assaying Samples:
• Load the serum samples into the sample rack of the analyzer.
• Program the analyzer with the necessary assay protocol,
including calibration information and quality control settings.
• Perform the assay as per the instructions provided by the assay
kit manufacturer.
• Ensure that any deviations or anomalies are duly noted and
addressed.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
a. The analyzer will generate results which must be reviewed and
validated by a certified technologist before reporting. b. Verifying:
• Compare the patient results with the expected reference range
which usually is:
◦ Seated: < 4.0 - 31.0 ng/dL
◦ Supine: < 4.0 - 16.0 ng/dL
• Flag any critical results and follow the laboratory’s protocol for
handling and documenting critical values. Immediate notification
to the healthcare provider is required. c. Record the validated
results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS) promptly. d.
Retain the physical or digital copy of the report as per the
laboratory’s policy for record retention.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
a. Ensure that cross-reactivity, matrix effects, and potential interfering
substances are reviewed as specified in the assay kit insert. b.
Consult the manufacturer’s insert for details on the assay’s lower limit
of detection, the upper and lower limits of the reference range, and
any conditions that may interfere with the assay.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING
a. Observe any error codes or alerts generated by the analyzer, and
refer to the manufacturer’s troubleshooting guide. b. If control or
calibrator results are out of range, re-run the samples. If issues
persist, perform maintenance as per the analyzer's maintenance
manual. c. In case of recurring problems, escalate the issue to the
laboratory supervisor.
