Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for ALDOSTERONE WITH
SODIUM, 24 HOUR, URINE
1. PURPOSE
To ensure the accurate measurement of aldosterone and sodium in
24-hour urine collections and to provide reliable results for clinical
diagnosis.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for the accurate and
timely processing of aldosterone and sodium tests in urine
specimens. Staff must follow this protocol to maintain consistency in
test results and ensure patient safety.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND ACCEPTABILITY
3.1 Preferred/Acceptable Specimens:
• 24-hour urine collection in a clean, appropriately labeled
container.
• Collected without preservatives.
• Must be kept refrigerated or stored on ice during the collection
period.
• The total volume of urine should be noted and recorded.
3.2 Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens contaminated with feces or other foreign materials.
• Specimens received more than 2 hours after the completion of the
collection period without refrigeration.
• Containers with leakage or insufficient labeling.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Analytical balance
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes
• Analytical instrumentation for aldosterone and electrolyte
measurement (e.g., Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry
for aldosterone and Ion-Selective Electrode for sodium)
Reagents:
• Standard aldosterone reagent kit
• Standard sodium reagent kit
• Quality control materials
• Calibration standards
Supplies:
• Urine collection containers
• Reagent bottles and vials
• Gloves and lab coats
• Labels and markers for specimen identification
5. PROCEDURE
5.1 Specimen Preparation
1. Verify that the urine collection is complete and the total volume
is recorded.
2. Mix the 24-hour urine collection thoroughly.
3. Aliquot a sufficient volume of urine (typically 20-50 mL) for
aldosterone and sodium analysis.
4. Label aliquots appropriately with patient identification and
collection date/time.
5.2 Analytical Procedure for Aldosterone
1. Follow the manufacturer’s guidelines for setting up the liquid
chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) system.
2. Perform calibration of the LC-MS system using calibration
standards.
3. Run quality control samples to ensure assay validity.
4. Load the urine sample onto the LC-MS system.
5. Initiate the analysis and ensure adherence to the method-
specific parameters.
6. Record and analyze the results.
5.3 Analytical Procedure for Sodium
1. Set up the ion-selective electrode analyzer as per
manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Perform calibration of the ion-selective electrode using standard
solutions.
3. Run quality control samples to verify the performance of the
analyzer.
4. Load the urine sample onto the ion-selective electrode
analyzer.
5. Perform the analysis and record sodium levels.
6. Review and validate the results.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Run internal quality control checks with each batch of
specimens.
2. Use appropriate quality control material for both aldosterone
and sodium measurements.
3. Document all quality control findings, corrective actions, and
instrument maintenance activities.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Enter the validated results into the laboratory information
system (LIS).
2. Review results for consistency and accuracy.
3. Release results to the clinician, ensuring that both aldosterone
and sodium values are correctly reported.
8. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Aldosterone: Reference intervals will be available in the specific kit
insert and should be updated as per latest guidelines.
Sodium: Typically 40-220 mmol/24 hours in standard clinical
screenings. Adjust as per reference source provided with the testing
kit.
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS AND TROUBLESHOOTING
Refer to the respective instrument and reagent kit inserts for specific
limitations and troubleshooting steps. Ensure maintenance of
instruments as per manufacturer’s recommendations to avoid errors
and inaccuracies in test results.
