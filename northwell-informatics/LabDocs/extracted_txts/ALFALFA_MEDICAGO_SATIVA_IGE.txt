Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for ALFALFA (Medicago sativa) IgE
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to accurately determine the
concentration of specific Immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies against
Alfalfa (Medicago sativa) in patient serum samples using an
ImmunoCAP system. The procedures ensure consistency, accuracy,
and reliability of test results, which are essential for the diagnosis and
management of allergies related to Alfalfa.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel trained and authorized
to perform the Alfalfa (Medicago sativa) IgE assay using the
ImmunoCAP system within the designated laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the laboratory personnel to adhere strictly to
these procedures and to document all activities. Supervisors and
laboratory managers are responsible for ensuring that personnel are
appropriately trained and competent in performing these procedures.
4. DEFINITION
Alfalfa (Medicago sativa) IgE: A specific type of immunoglobulin E
antibody that targets allergens found in Alfalfa. Measurement of these
antibodies helps to diagnose sensitization and allergies related to
Alfalfa.
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type:
• Serum
Specimen Collection:
• Collect blood in a red-top or serum-separator tube (SST).
• Allow the blood to clot at room temperature for 30 minutes, and
then centrifuge at 3,000 RPM for 10 minutes to separate the
serum.
Specimen Storage:
• Serum samples can be stored at 2-8°C for up to 7 days. For
longer storage, samples should be frozen at -20°C or lower.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens that are hemolyzed, lipemic, or not properly labeled
will be rejected.
6. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• ImmunoCAP system (including reader and software)
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes and Pipette tips (calibrated)
• Vortex mixer
• Refrigerators/Freezers
Reagents:
• ImmunoCAP reagents specific for Alfalfa (Medicago sativa) IgE
(includes allergen-coated caps and assay buffer)
• Calibrators and Controls (Negative and Positive)
• Wash solution (as provided by the manufacturer)
Supplies:
• Serum separator tubes (SST)
• Disposable gloves and lab coat
• Laboratory bench protector
• Result documentation forms/logs
7. PROCEDURE
7.1. Preparation of Work Area:
1. Clean and disinfect workbenches before starting the assay.
2. Gather all necessary reagents, calibrators, controls, and
supplies.
3. Ensure all reagents are within their expiration date and have
been stored correctly.
4. Turn on the ImmunoCAP system and allow it to warm up as per
manufacturer instructions.
7.2. Sample Preparation and Loading:
1. Verify patient specimen identification and integrity.
2. Pipette appropriate volumes of calibrators, controls, and patient
serum samples into the wells provided in the ImmunoCAP
holder.
3. Add appropriate assay buffer to each sample as per the
manufacturer’s instructions.
4. Cap the wells and place them into the ImmunoCAP system.
7.3. Running the Assay:
1. Follow the ImmunoCAP reagent instructions for the specific
Alfalfa (Medicago sativa) IgE test.
2. Load the plate onto the ImmunoCAP system.
3. Initiate the run sequence according to the ImmunoCAP
operator’s manual.
4. Monitor the assay run to ensure no errors occur. Address errors
following the manufacturer’s troubleshooting guide.
7.4. Result Reading and Documentation:
1. Upon completion of the assay, retrieve the results from the
ImmunoCAP system.
2. Review and verify the calibration curves, and control results to
ensure they fall within acceptable ranges.
3. Document results for each patient sample in the laboratory
information system.
4. Address any out-of-control results per QC failure protocol (see
section Internal Quality Control Procedures).
8. INTERNAL QUALITY CONTROL PROCEDURES
1. Run positive and negative controls with each batch of patient
samples.
2. If controls do not fall within the acceptable range, invalidate the
run and repeat the assay.
3. Document all control results and any corrective actions taken.
9. REPORTING RESULTS:
1. Results should be reviewed by a qualified laboratory scientist
before reporting.
2. Reference Intervals:
◦ Specific ranges for IgE levels should be used as referenced
from the ImmunoCAP system guidelines.
3. Report results to the appropriate clinician or upload into the
patient's electronic medical record (EMR) per standard
reporting protocols.

11. REVISION AND DOCUMENTATION:
This SOP will be reviewed annually and revised as necessary.
Changes to the procedure must be approved by the Laboratory
Supervisor and documented appropriately.
