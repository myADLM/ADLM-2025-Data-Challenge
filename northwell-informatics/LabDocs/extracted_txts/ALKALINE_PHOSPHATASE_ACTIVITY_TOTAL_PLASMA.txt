Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analysis of Alkaline
Phosphatase Activity, Total, Plasma
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standard methodology for the quantitative determination
of total alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity in plasma using a
spectrophotometric method. The purpose is to ensure accuracy and
reliability of results.
Responsibility: It is the responsibility of designated staff to perform
the ALP activity assay following the procedures outlined in this
protocol. Staff are also responsible for verifying the quality control,
maintaining equipment, and documenting procedures and results.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/Acceptable Specimen:
• Plasma collected using heparin as anticoagulant (green-top
tubes).
• Minimum volume required: 0.5 mL of plasma.
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Specimens hemolyzed or improperly anticoagulated.
• Plasma collected in sodium citrate, sodium fluoride/oxalate, or
EDTA tubes.
Specimen Stability:
• Plasma should be separated from cells as soon as possible,
ideally within 2 hours of collection.
• Specimens are stable for up to 7 days at 2-8°C or 12 months at
-20°C.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Spectrophotometer
• Heparinized plasma (specimen)
• Alkaline phosphatase reagent kit (commercially available,
including calibrators and controls)
• Disposable cuvettes
• Pipettes and tips
• Deionized water
1. QUALITY CONTROL
Quality control materials:
• Use high, medium, and low control materials provided by the
reagent kit manufacturer.
• Control materials should be stored according to manufacturer
recommendations, typically 2-8°C until expiration.
Quality control procedure:
• Run controls with each batch of patient specimens.
• Document and evaluate control results before analyzing patient
samples.
• If controls are out of the acceptable range, troubleshoot and
resolve issues before proceeding with patient specimens.
1. PROCEDURE
2. Preparation:
◦ Set the spectrophotometer to 405 nm.
◦ Prewarm the alkaline phosphatase reagent to room
temperature.
3. Sample Handling:
◦ Allow plasma samples and controls to reach room
temperature before analysis.
◦ Mix samples gently before analysis.
4. Pipetting:
◦ Pipette 20 µL of plasma sample or control into a disposable
cuvette.
◦ Add 1 mL of ALP reagent to the cuvette. Mix gently by
inversion.
5. Incubation:
◦ Incubate the reaction mixture at 37°C for 10 minutes.
6. Measurement:
◦ After incubation, measure the absorbance of the reaction
mixture at 405 nm using a spectrophotometer.
◦ Record the absorbance.
7. Calculation:
◦ Calculate the ALP activity using the formula provided by the
reagent kit manufacturer. This typically involves converting
the change in absorbance to enzyme activity using a
calibration curve or a standard factor provided with the kit.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results should be reported in U/L (units per liter).
• Reference range: 30-120 U/L (may vary based on the laboratory's
patient population and method validation).
• Document results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
ensuring that quality control results are reviewed and verified.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolyzed samples can give falsely elevated ALP values.
• Icteric or lipemic samples may interfere with spectrophotometric
readings and should be noted.
• Verify abnormal results and consider clinical context before
reporting.

• Manufacturer’s instructions for the alkaline phosphatase reagent
kit.

clinical chemistry.
This Standard Operating Procedure is to be reviewed annually and
updated as necessary to comply with current laboratory standards
and practices.
