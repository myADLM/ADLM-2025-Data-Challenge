Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analysis of Alkaline
Phosphatase Isoenzymes, Serum
1. Purpose
To provide a standardized method for the analysis and differentiation
of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) isoenzymes in serum using
electrophoretic techniques or heat inactivation methods to help in
diagnosis of various conditions related to the liver, bone, intestine,
and placenta.
1. Scope
This procedure applies to the clinical laboratory personnel performing
the analytical phase of generating results for serum alkaline
phosphatase isoenzymes in a CLIA-certified laboratory.
1. Responsibility
It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory personnel to
ensure that these procedures are followed precisely and adopt
necessary corrective actions whenever deviations or anomalies are
noted.
1. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies
• Electrophoresis System or Heat Inactivation Setup
• Buffer Reagents as per manufacturer’s instructions
• Serum Separation Tubes (SST)
• Calibrators and Control Sera
• Pipettes and Tips
• Refrigerator/Freezer (-20°C)
• Heat Block/Water Bath maintaining 56°C±1°C
• Staining reagents (if using electrophoresis)
• ALP Isoenzyme Kit as per manufacturer’s guidelines
1. Specimen Requirements
• Specimen Type: Serum
• Collection: Blood should be collected without anticoagulants and
allowed to clot. Then, centrifuge the sample to separate the
serum.
• Stability: Serum samples are stable for up to 7 days when
refrigerated at 2-8°C or for up to 3 months when frozen at -20°C.
1. Quality Control
• QC Material: Utilize commercial control sera with known ALP
isoenzyme levels.
• Frequency: Analyze controls with each batch of patient samples.
• Acceptable Ranges: Follow manufacturer’s recommended control
values and ranges.
• Document any deviations and corrective action taken.
1. Protocol
A. Pre-Analytical Procedures
1. Ensure all required equipment, reagents, and materials are
ready and functioning.
2. Collect and prepare the serum samples as indicated above.
B. Analytical Procedures
Using Electrophoresis Method
1. Preparation
◦ Prepare the electrophoresis gel and buffer according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
◦ Allow buffers and reagents to reach room temperature.
2. Sample Application
◦ Apply control and patient serum samples onto the gel as per
the manufacturer’s protocol.
◦ Use a pipette to apply an accurate volume directly onto the
gel wells.
3. Electrophoresis
◦ Set the electrophoresis unit to appropriate voltage and run
time as recommended.
◦ Ensure proper insulation and monitoring during
electrophoresis.
4. Staining and Visualization
◦ Post electrophoresis, stain the gel to visualize the
isoenzyme bands.
◦ Follow the specific staining and destaining process
delineated in the kit instructions.
◦ Allow the gel to dry for further interpretation.
5. Interpretation
◦ Compare the patient sample bands with controls.
◦ Document and interpret the pattern of isoenzyme
distribution.
Using Heat Inactivation Method
1. Preparation
◦ Prepare 2 aliquots of the patient serum sample.
◦ Label one tube as "Control" (unheated) and the other one as
"Heated."
2. Heating
◦ Place the "Heated" tube in a water bath or heat block at
56°C±1°C for 10 minutes.
3. Analysis
◦ Cool the heated sample to room temperature.
◦ Measure ALP activity for both aliquots using an autoanalyzer
or manual method.
4. Calculation
◦ Calculate the percentage of activity remaining after heating.
◦ Compare the percentages to the standard charts provided to
differentiate the isoenzymes.
5. Reporting Results
• Record the ALP isoenzyme pattern for each patient.
• Verify results against quality control data.
• Report results through the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
with the appropriate clinical interpretation.
1. Reference Ranges
• Include reference intervals specific to the method utilized, based
on population studies or manufacturer guidelines.
1. Method Limitations
• Electrophoresis: Less sensitive for minor isoenzymes; potential
for overlapping bands.
• Heat Inactivation: May not fully differentiate among all
isoenzymes; precision is limited by heating uniformity.
1. References
• Manufacturer’s product inserts and guidelines for ALP Isoenzyme
kits.
• Laboratory’s internal validation and quality control documentation.
This protocol ensures the precise and reliable analysis of alkaline
phosphatase isoenzymes to assist in the accurate diagnosis of liver,
bone, intestinal, and placental pathologies.
