STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP) FOR THE
ANALYTICAL PHASE OF GENERATING RESULTS FOR
ALKALINE PHOSPHATASE (ALP), SERUM:
1. PURPOSE To provide a standardized procedure for the
accurate and precise determination of serum Alkaline
Phosphatase (ALP) levels to ensure the reliability of results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY It is the responsibility of all trained
laboratory personnel to perform the assay according to this
SOP. The laboratory supervisor shall ensure that all staff are
adequately trained and competent in this procedure.
3. DEFINITION Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP) is an enzyme related
to the bile ducts and can be used as a marker for liver function,
bone disorders, and other conditions.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND PREPARATION
• Specimen Type: Serum
• Specimen Collection: Blood should be collected in a serum-
separator tube (SST). Allow the blood to clot at room temperature
and then separate the serum by centrifugation within 2 hours of
collection.
• Specimen Storage: Store serum samples at 2-8°C if the analysis
is to be performed within 24 hours. For longer storage, freeze
aliquots at -20°C or lower.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Automated chemistry analyzer (e.g., Roche Cobas, Beckman AU)
• Alkaline Phosphatase Reagent Kit (matched to the specific
analyzer)
• Calibrators and Controls
• Pipettes and tips (if manual intervention is necessary)
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) including gloves, lab coat,
and eye protection
1. PROCEDURE
A) Calibration and Quality Control:
• Perform calibration of the analyzer using the ALP reagent kit
calibrators as per the manufacturer's instructions.
• Run at least two levels of quality control material (e.g., normal and
abnormal) at the beginning of each shift, after calibration, after
maintenance, and whenever a new reagent lot is introduced.
• Ensure that control results fall within the acceptable target ranges
before proceeding with patient sample analysis.
B) Sample Preparation:
• Thaw frozen serum samples at room temperature and mix gently
by inversion. Ensure samples are free from fibrin clots or other
particulates.
• Load samples onto the automated analyzer using the designated
sample cups/tubes.
C) Running the Assay:
• Load the Alkaline Phosphatase reagent pack/cartridges into the
automated chemistry analyzer.
• Follow the analyzer-specific procedure to select the ALP assay
and initiate the analysis.
• The analyzer will automatically mix the reagent with the sample,
incubate, and measure the enzyme activity.
D) Result Interpretation:
• The analyzer will automatically calculate the ALP concentration in
the serum sample based on the absorbance change.
• Verify that calibration and quality control results are within the
acceptable limits before accepting patient results.
1. REPORTING RESULTS:
• Results should be reviewed and verified for accuracy and
consistency by laboratory technologists.
• Document and release results through the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
• Report critical values according to the laboratory’s established
policy, including immediate notification to the clinician if ALP levels
fall within the critical range.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS:
• The reference intervals may vary based on the methodology and
population. Typical ranges for ALP in serum are:
◦ Adults: 30-120 U/L
◦ Children: Higher levels are common, reference intervals must
be age-specific as per the instrument's reference.
1. QUALITY CONTROL:
• Ensure routine participation in external quality assurance
programs for ALP measurement.
• Analyze and document quality control data regularly to ensure the
ongoing accuracy and precision of the assay.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples can interfere with the
assay results.
• Ensure samples are clear and free of visible hemolysis.
1. RECORD KEEPING:
• Maintain all calibration, quality control, and patient test records as
per laboratory policy and regulatory requirements.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING:
• If the internal quality controls fall outside the acceptable range, do
not report patient results. Investigate and correct the issue by
following the manufacturer’s troubleshooting guidelines.
• Record and document all troubleshooting actions taken.
