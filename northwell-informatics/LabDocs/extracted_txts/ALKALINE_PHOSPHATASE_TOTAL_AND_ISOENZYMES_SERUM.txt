Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Alkaline Phosphatase, Total and Isoenzymes,
Serum
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to ensure consistent and accurate
analytical processing, measurement, and reporting of serum Alkaline
Phosphatase (ALP) levels, including total and isoenzyme fractions.
This procedure aims to minimize errors and ensure the integrity,
accuracy, and precision of test results for Alkaline Phosphatase, Total
and Isoenzymes in serum specimens.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of laboratory personnel to perform serum ALP
testing accurately and to follow this SOP carefully. Laboratory
technologists are responsible for ensuring that equipment is
functioning correctly, reagents are not expired, and all internal quality
control measures are maintained. Supervisors must oversee the
process and ensure compliance with the SOP.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Sample Type: Serum
• Collection: Collect blood in a serum separator tube (SST). Allow
the blood to clot at room temperature for 30 minutes before
centrifugation.
• Centrifugation: Centrifuge the SST at 1500 g for 10 minutes to
separate serum.
• Storage: Serum samples should be stored at 2-8°C if analyzed
within 24 hours. For longer storage, freeze samples at -20°C or
below.
1. EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS
• Automated chemistry analyzer (e.g., Roche Cobas, Beckman
Coulter AU)
• Calibrated pipettes
• Controls and calibrators specific to Alkaline Phosphatase and
isoenzyme tests
• Appropriate reagents and substrates for ALP total and isoenzyme
tests
• Serum separator tubes (SST)
1. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation and Instrument Setup
1. Ensure that the chemistry analyzer is calibrated and that the
temperature and humidity of the laboratory are within
acceptable limits.
2. Confirm that all reagents, controls, and calibrators are not
expired and are appropriately stored.
3. Prepare and run control samples to confirm the performance of
the analyzer.
B) Total Alkaline Phosphatase Testing
1. Load serum samples, control samples, and calibrators onto the
analyzer according to the manufacturer's instructions.
2. Program the analyzer to measure total Alkaline Phosphatase
activity using the appropriate method (e.g., colorimetric method
using p-nitrophenyl phosphate as a substrate).
3. Verify that calibration and quality control results are within
acceptable ranges before proceeding with patient sample
analysis.
4. Run patient serum samples on the analyzer.
5. Review and verify the results. Investigate any outliers or
suspect results by reassessing calibration, quality control, and
potential pre-analytical variables.
C) Alkaline Phosphatase Isoenzymes Testing
1. Separate isoenzymes may require additional processing steps
such as electrophoresis or heat inactivation.
2. Prepare serum samples and quality control materials specific
for isoenzyme analysis.
3. Separate ALP isoenzymes using the specified method (e.g., gel
electrophoresis or specific inhibitor method).
4. Detect and measure the activity of individual isoenzymes using
quantitation techniques approved by the laboratory.
5. Review and verify the results. Compare with controls to ensure
accurate isoenzyme identification and measurement.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform daily, monthly, and as needed quality control according to
the laboratory’s schedule and regulatory guidelines.
• Analyze at least two levels of control samples (normal and
abnormal) for each run.
• Acceptance criteria for quality control must meet the
manufacturer's specifications and laboratory standards.
• Document any corrective actions taken if control results fall
outside acceptable limits.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Review all results for accuracy and consistency.
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS) for
verification and subsequent transmission to the clinician.
• Interpret and report total ALP levels and isoenzyme fractionation
as per the laboratory’s reference intervals and clinical relevance.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Total Alkaline Phosphatase: Refer to the laboratory’s established
reference intervals, which may vary based on age and gender.
• Isoenzymes: Report the percentage or activity level of each
isoenzyme fraction according to established reference values.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolysis, lipemia, or icterus can interfere with ALP
measurements. Document and interpret any potential
interferences.
• Specimen stability issues: Analyze samples promptly. Frozen
samples must be completely thawed and mixed before analysis.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions and product inserts for reagents,
controls, and analyzers.
• CLSI guidelines for enzyme assays.
• Relevant clinical laboratory textbooks and peer-reviewed articles
on ALP and isoenzyme testing.
1. DOCUMENT CONTROL
• Maintain a record of all SOP reviews and updates.
• Ensure that all personnel are trained on the SOP and any
subsequent updates.
• Keep logs of equipment calibration, maintenance, and quality
control activities.
