STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE FOR ALK MUTATION
ANALYSIS, NEXT-GENERATION SEQUENCING, TUMOR
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to outline the steps required to
perform ALK mutation analysis using next-generation sequencing
(NGS) on tumor samples. This SOP ensures that the mutation
analysis is conducted accurately, reliably, and in compliance with
regulatory standards.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
All laboratory personnel performing ALK mutation analysis are
responsible for following this protocol. It is the responsibility of the
laboratory supervisor to ensure that all staff members are properly
trained and that the procedures outlined in this document are strictly
adhered to.
1. SPECIMEN
Acceptable Specimens:
• Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue: Minimum
of 5 unstained slides with 5-10 micron sections.
• Fresh frozen tumor tissue: Minimum 10 mg of tissue, stored at
-80°C until use.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens with insufficient tumor cell content (below 20%).
• Specimens with extensive necrosis or fixation artifacts.
• Specimens without clear identification or labeling.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Microtome
• DNA extraction kit (specific for FFPE or fresh/frozen tissue)
• NanoDrop Spectrophotometer
• Qubit Fluorometer
• PCR thermal cycler
• NGS Library Preparation Kit (manufacturer specific)
• Sequencing platform (e.g., Illumina, Ion Torrent)
• Bioinformatics analysis software (validated for ALK mutation
detection)
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
• Ethanol, DNase/RNase-free water, and other molecular grade
reagents
1. PROCEDURE
A. DNA Extraction:
1. FFPE Tissue:
◦ Deparaffinize tumor tissue sections using xylene and
ethanol washes.
◦ Proceed with DNA extraction following the manufacturer’s
protocol of the DNA extraction kit.
◦ Quantify DNA using NanoDrop and Qubit. Ensure DNA
concentration is >10 ng/µL and A260/A280 ratio is between
1.8 and 2.0.
2. Fresh Frozen Tissue:
◦ Thaw and homogenize tissue in the appropriate buffer.
◦ Proceed with DNA extraction following the manufacturer’s
protocol of the DNA extraction kit.
◦ Quantify DNA using NanoDrop and Qubit. Ensure DNA
concentration is >10 ng/µL and A260/A280 ratio is between
1.8 and 2.0.
B. Library Preparation:
1. Amplify target regions including ALK gene using a validated
PCR assay.
2. Purify PCR products using a purification kit.
3. Quantify PCR products using Qubit.
4. Proceed with NGS library preparation using the NGS Library
Preparation Kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
5. Ensure proper DNA quantification and quality assessment at
each step.
C. Sequencing:
1. Load the prepared libraries onto the sequencing platform.
2. Start the sequencing run according to the manufacturer’s
protocol.
3. Monitor run parameters and ensure that the quality metrics are
within acceptable limits.
D. Data Analysis:
1. Transfer raw sequencing data to the bioinformatics analysis
software.
2. Perform sequence alignment, variant calling, and annotation
according to validated pipelines.
3. Review the data quality and integrity. Confirm the presence of
ALK mutations.
4. Interpret the results in the context of clinical relevance.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include positive and negative controls in each batch of DNA
extraction, PCR, and sequencing runs.
• Perform regular instrument calibration and maintenance as per
manufacturer guidelines.
• Run internal quality controls with known ALK mutations alongside
patient samples to ensure reliability.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
2. Validate and review the sequence data and variant calls.
3. Document all findings in the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
4. Generate a detailed report including the detected ALK
mutation(s), variant allele frequency (VAF), and clinical
interpretation.
5. Ensure the report is reviewed and signed by a qualified
pathologist or molecular geneticist before dissemination.
6. RECORDS MANAGEMENT
• Maintain records of specimen receipt, processing, and analysis.
• Document all QC measures, instrument settings, and
maintenance logs.
• Retain raw data and final reports in accordance with laboratory
policy and regulatory requirements.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s protocols for DNA extraction kits, NGS library
preparation kits, and sequencing platforms.
• Bioinformatics analysis software manuals.
• Relevant scientific literature and clinical guidelines on ALK
mutation analysis.
1. REVIEW AND APPROVAL
Ensure the SOP is reviewed annually or when significant changes
are made to equipment, reagents, or procedures. The SOP must be
approved by laboratory management and the quality assurance
department.
