STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP)
Title: Analytical Procedure for ALLERGEN IGE ANTIBODY, BLOOD
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this SOP is to describe the
standardized procedure for the analysis of Allergen IgE
Antibodies in blood samples using specific immunoassay
technology (e.g., ImmunoCAP, ELISA). This ensures accuracy,
reliability, and reproducibility of test results.
Responsibility: It is the responsibility of all designated laboratory
personnel to follow this procedure accurately and ensure compliance
with all quality control measures.
1. SCOPE This procedure applies to the analysis of Allergen IgE
Antibodies in human blood specimens received by the
laboratory.
2. SPECIMEN ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
◦ Preferred Specimen: Serum or plasma collected in an
EDTA, heparin, or SST tube.
◦ Volume: Minimum 0.5 mL of serum/plasma.
◦ Specimen should be free from hemolysis or lipemia.
◦ Specimens should be labeled properly with patient
identification and collection date/time.
◦ Specimens should be processed and stored at 2-8°C if not
immediately analyzed. For longer storage, specimens
should be frozen at -20°C or lower.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
◦ Immunoassay analyzer (e.g., Phadia ImmunoCAP, ELISA
reader)
◦ Allergen-specific Immunoassay kits and reagents
◦ Calibrators and controls specific to the Immunoassay
method
◦ Micropipettes and tips
◦ Centrifuge
◦ Vortex mixer
◦ Timer
◦ Incubator (if required by procedure)
◦ Disposable gloves, lab coat, and other PPE as necessary
4. REAGENT PREPARATION
◦ Prepare reagents, calibrators, and controls according to
manufacturer's instructions.
◦ Allow all reagents to come to room temperature (20-25°C)
before use.
◦ Ensure all reagents are within their expiration dates.
5. PROCEDURE A) Sample Preparation:
1. Verify patient identification and specimen integrity upon
receipt.
2. Aliquot the required volume of serum/plasma from the
specimen.
3. If sample is frozen, thaw at room temperature and mix
gently.
B) Calibration: 1. Calibrate the analyzer using the provided
calibrators (follow the specific instructions provided in the assay kit
insert).
C) Quality Control: 1. Run controls at defined intervals, including: -
Negative control - Low-level positive control - High-level positive
control 2. Document control results and ensure they fall within the
acceptable range before proceeding with patient samples.
D) Patient Sample Analysis: 1. Load samples, calibrators, and
controls into the analyzer as per the manufacturer’s instructions. - If
using an ELISA method, add the required volumes of samples,
calibrators, and controls to designated wells in the ELISA plate. 2.
Follow the processing steps defined by the immunoassay method: -
Incubation times and temperatures - Wash steps and procedures -
Addition of detection reagents (enzyme conjugates, substrates etc.) -
Signal detection (e.g., absorption reading for ELISA, fluorescence for
ImmunoCAP) 3. Record and validate all results.
1. RESULT INTERPRETATION
◦ Review all results against the specific allergy panel
reference ranges provided by the manufacturer.
◦ Positive results indicate the presence of IgE antibodies
specific to tested allergens.
◦ Results are quantified, typically in kU/L, with established
thresholds for low to high allergen-specific IgE levels.
2. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ Enter validated results into the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
◦ Include reference ranges and patient-specific comments as
necessary.
◦ Notify healthcare providers immediately in case of critical or
unexpected findings.
3. QUALITY CONTROL AND DOCUMENTATION
◦ Document all stages of sample handling, processing, and
analysis.
◦ Record calibration and quality control data.
◦ Perform periodic maintenance and calibration of the assay
equipment.
◦ Ensure that all quality control results are reviewed and
documented according to the laboratory’s Quality Control
Policy.
4. TROUBLESHOOTING
◦ If calibrators or controls fall outside acceptable ranges, do
not proceed with patient testing. Review procedure for
potential errors, repeat calibration/controls, or contact
technical support.
◦ Deviations or assay failures should be documented and
corrective actions should be taken and recorded.
