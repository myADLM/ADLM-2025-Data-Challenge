STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP) FOR ALLERGIC
BRONCHOPULMONARY ASPERGILLOSIS PANEL II
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this SOP is to outline the
procedures for performing the Allergic Bronchopulmonary
Aspergillosis (ABPA) Panel II test, ensuring accurate and
reliable results for the diagnosis and monitoring of ABPA.
2. SCOPE This SOP applies to all clinical laboratory personnel
responsible for performing ABPA Panel II testing.
3. RESPONSIBILITY It is the responsibility of all designated
laboratory personnel to perform the ABPA Panel II test
according to this SOP and to report any issues to the laboratory
supervisor or manager promptly.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
◦ Specimen Type:
▪ Serum
◦ Specimen Collection:
▪ 5 mL of whole blood collected in a serum separator tube
(SST).
◦ Specimen Handling and Transport:
▪ Allow the blood to clot at room temperature (for at least
30 minutes).
▪ Centrifuge the SST at 2000-3000 x g for 10-15 minutes
to separate the serum.
▪ Carefully transfer the serum into a labeled transport
tube.
▪ Specimens should be stored at 2-8°C if not analyzed
immediately.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
◦ Equipment:
▪ Centrifuge
▪ Micropipettes and tips
▪ ELISA Reader
▪ Incubator
◦ Reagents:
▪ ABPA Panel II ELISA Kit
▪ Wash Buffer
▪ Substrate Solution
▪ Stop Solution
▪ Calibrators and Controls
◦ Supplies:
▪ ABPA Panel II microtiter plates
▪ Pipette tips
▪ Tubes for serum separation
6. PROCEDURE
A) PREPARATION
• Ensure all equipment is properly calibrated and maintained.
• Allow reagents to reach room temperature before beginning the
assay.
• Prepare wash buffer and substrate solution according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
B) ASSAY PROTOCOL
1. Sample Preparation
◦ Dilute serum samples as per the manufacturer’s
instructions.
2. Plate Setup
◦ Place the desired number of wells of microtiter plate
reserved for ABPA assays.
◦ Add 100 μL of each calibrator, control, and diluted patient
sample into the assigned wells.
3. Incubation
◦ Incubate the plate at 37°C for the specific time indicated in
the kit insert (usually 1-2 hours).
4. Washing
◦ Wash the wells several times with the wash buffer according
to the manufacturer’s protocol.
5. Substrate Addition
◦ Add 100 μL of substrate solution to each well.
◦ Incubate at room temperature in the dark for 10-15 minutes.
6. Stop Reaction
◦ Add 50 μL of stop solution to each well to stop the reaction.
7. Reading the Plate
◦ Read the absorbance at the appropriate wavelength (usually
450 nm) within 30 minutes of stopping the reaction.
C) RESULT INTERPRETATION
• Calculate the results using the software provided with the ELISA
reader.
• Compare the optical density (OD) values of the samples with the
OD of the calibrators and controls.
• Results are generated as specific antibody levels (IgE, IgG) for
Aspergillus fumigatus.
D) QUALITY CONTROL
• Include negative and positive controls in each run for validation.
• Ensure all controls are within the expected ranges. Any deviation
must be investigated, and corrective actions documented.
• Re-run the assay if controls are out of range.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ Review and verify results before reporting them.
◦ Enter the results into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS) for the final report.
◦ Critical values and unexpected results should be
communicated to the requesting physician immediately.
2. METHOD LIMITATIONS
◦ Ensure to refer to the kit insert for any specific limitations
related to the ABPA Panel II assay.
◦ Cross-reactivity with other fungi may cause false positive
results.
3. NOTES
◦ Handle all specimens and reagents using appropriate
biosafety procedures.
◦ Follow manufacturer’s instructions for reagent and kit
storage.
◦ Document all steps taken in the laboratory logbook.
4. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Refer to the manufacturer’s guidelines or established laboratory
reference ranges for interpreting results.
