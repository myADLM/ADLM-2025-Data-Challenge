Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Analytical Phase of Generating Results for Allo-Isoleucine,
Blood Spot
1. Purpose: To establish the necessary steps and criteria for
performing and generating results for Allo-Isoleucine from blood spot
specimens to ensure accuracy, precision, and reliability.
2. Scope: This procedure applies to the analysis of Allo-Isoleucine
from dried blood spot samples in a CLIA-certified laboratory.
3. Responsibility: Laboratory staff authorized and trained in Allo-
Isoleucine analysis are responsible for carrying out, documenting,
and reviewing the procedures in this SOP.
4. Equipment and Supplies:
• LC-MS/MS system validated for Allo-Isoleucine analysis
• Micro centrifuge
• Pipettes and microtips
• Vortex mixer
• Biohazard disposal container
• Gloves and PPE
• Solvents and reagents: Mobile Phase A (Water with 0.1% formic
acid), Mobile Phase B (Acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid)
• Calibration standards and quality control materials
• 96-well plate or suitable sample holder
• Extraction buffer (e.g., methanol/water, 80:20)
5. Definitions:
• Allo-Isoleucine: An isomer of isoleucine, often indicative of
metabolic disorders such as maple syrup urine disease (MSUD)
when present in elevated levels.
• Blood Spot: Dried blood sample collected on filter paper,
commonly used for newborn screening.
6. Procedure:
6.1 Sample Preparation:
1. Punch out a 3.2 mm diameter disc or another designated area
from the blood spot card. Place it into the well of a 96-well plate
or other sample holders.
2. Add 100 µL of extraction buffer to each well containing a blood
spot disc.
3. Vortex the plate for 30 seconds to ensure proper mixing.
4. Centrifuge at 2000 g for 2 minutes to settle any debris.
5. Transfer 80 µL of the supernatant to a clean 96-well plate or
other vials suitable for the LC-MS/MS system using a multi-
channel pipette. Ensure that supernatants are clearly labeled
with corresponding patient IDs.
6.2 LC-MS/MS Analysis:
1. Calibrate the LC-MS/MS system with a set of Allo-Isoleucine
standards at known concentrations. Follow the manufacturer's
instructions for calibration adjustments.
2. Run quality control samples at low, medium, and high
concentration levels to ensure the accuracy, precision, and
reliability of results.
3. Inject 10 µL of each prepared blood spot extract into the LC-
MS/MS system.
4. Set the LC-MS/MS to the pre-validated method for Allo-
Isoleucine analysis, ensuring parameters such as column type,
gradient elution, flow rate, and MS settings are consistent with
the validated method.
5. Analyze the samples and quality control materials along with a
reagent blank to ensure that no contamination is introduced
during sample preparation.
6.3 Data Analysis:
1. Acquire and process data using the LC-MS/MS software.
Ensure that the integration of the Allo-Isoleucine peak is
accurate.
2. Compare sample results against calibration curves to determine
the concentration of Allo-Isoleucine in each blood spot sample.
3. Verify that all quality control results fall within the acceptable
range.
7. Reporting Results:
1. Document results in the laboratory information system (LIS) or
a secure results database.
2. Cross-verify results to confirm consistency and accuracy.
3. Flag any results that are outside normal reference ranges for
further review or additional testing if necessary.
8. Quality Control:
1. Process and analyze quality control samples—one low, one
medium, one high concentration—at the beginning and the end
of each analytical run.
2. Investigate and resolve any out-of-specification results before
reporting patient samples.
3. Document all quality control results and any corrective actions
taken in the quality control log.
9. Method Limitations: Ensure that matrix interference, sample
storage, and handling conditions are controlled to minimize variability.
Remake samples if contamination or significant degradation of
samples is suspected.
10. References: Refer to LC-MS/MS instrument manuals, reagent
material safety data sheets (MSDS), and manufacturer instructions
for specifics on the handling and analysis required for Allo-Isoleucine
assays.
11. Corrective Actions: In case of instrument failure, quality control
failures, or deviations from expected results, immediately notify the
laboratory supervisor. Document the issue and implement corrective
actions according to facility procedures before resuming analysis.
12. Review: This protocol shall be reviewed annually or as required
by changes in methodology, equipment, or laboratory regulations.
