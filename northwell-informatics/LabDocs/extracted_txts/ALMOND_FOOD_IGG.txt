Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for ALMOND FOOD IGG
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedures for the analysis
and reporting of Almond Food IgG results, ensuring accuracy and
reliability in the generated results.
Responsibility:
The laboratory technologists are responsible for performing the
analysis according to the procedures defined in this SOP.
Supervisors are responsible for reviewing and verifying the results,
ensuring compliance with quality control protocols, and addressing
any issues that arise during the analytical phase.
1. DEFINITION
Almond Food IgG Test: An immunoassay designed to measure the
concentration of IgG antibodies against almond proteins in human
serum.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen Type: Serum is the preferred specimen type for Almond
Food IgG testing.
Specimen Collection: Blood should be collected using standard
venipuncture procedures into a serum separator tube (SST). After
collection, blood should be allowed to clot for 30-60 minutes and then
centrifuged at 1500-2000g for 10-15 minutes to separate the serum.
Specimen Stability:
• Stored at 2-8°C: stable for up to 48 hours.
• Stored at -20°C or lower: stable for up to 6 months.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens that are hemolyzed, lipemic, or contaminated.
• Specimens not stored within the designated stability timeframe.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• ELISA Plate Reader
• Micropipettes and tips
• Plate washer or manual washing supplies
• Incubator (37°C)
Reagents:
• IgG-specific ELISA kit for almond protein (including standards,
controls, and diluents as provided in the kit)
• Wash buffer
• Substrate solution (e.g., TMB)
• Stop solution
1. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation:
• Review the kit insert and verify that all components match the lot
numbers.
• Ensure that all reagents, controls, and specimens are at room
temperature before use.
• Prepare the wash buffer and dilute standards and controls as
outlined in the kit insert.
B) Assay Procedure:
1. Plate Setup:
◦ Allocate wells for standards, controls, and samples in
duplicate.
◦ Label the ELISA plate with the necessary information (e.g.,
sample IDs, standards, controls).
2. Adding Samples:
◦ Pipette 100 µL of standards, controls, and diluted samples
into the designated wells.
◦ Seal the plate and incubate at 37°C for 60 minutes.
3. Washing:
◦ Wash the plate using the automated plate washer or
manually with wash buffer. Perform 3-5 washes according to
the kit insert's recommendation.
4. Detection:
◦ Add 100 µL of detection antibody solution to each well.
◦ Incubate for 60 minutes at 37°C.
◦ Wash the plate again as described above.
5. Substrate Reaction:
◦ Add 100 µL of substrate solution to each well. Incubate in
the dark for 20-30 minutes at room temperature.
◦ Add 50 µL of stop solution to each well to halt the reaction.
6. Reading Results:
◦ Measure the absorbance at the specific wavelength (e.g.,
450 nm) using the ELISA plate reader.
◦ Record the absorbance values and interpret the results
using the calibration curve generated from the standards.
C) Quality Control:
• Run assay controls for each batch of tests to ensure reliability.
• Acceptable ranges for controls must be verified according to the
kit insert.
• Document any deviations or corrective actions taken.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
Documentation:
• Verify that the results are within the acceptable range for the
standards and controls before reporting.
• Enter sample results into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
• Review and verify results as per site-specific guidelines.
Reference Ranges: Refer to the kit insert for appropriate reference
ranges for Almond Food IgG.
Critical Results: Any critical result must be promptly communicated
to the requesting provider as per laboratory policy. Document the
communication accordingly.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the kit insert for specific limitations regarding the Almond
Food IgG assay.
