SOP for the Analytical Phase of High Sensitivity Food Allergen
Testing: ALMOND, IGE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE To define the standard protocol for the analytical phase
of generating results for Almond IgE (Immunoglobulin E) in serum,
ensuring the accuracy and reliability of test results to assist in patient
diagnosis and management.
2. SCOPE This procedure applies to all personnel involved in the
analysis of Almond IgE in serum specimens in the laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY Designated laboratory personnel are
responsible for performing the analytical procedures as outlined.
Supervisory staff are responsible for ensuring all designated
personnel have adequate training, and for overseeing the overall
quality control and troubleshooting processes.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen: - Preferred: 2-4 mL of serum, separated from the
collected blood within 2 hours. - Properly labeled with patient
identification details.
Storage: - Serum specimens should be stored at 2-8°C if analyzed
within 48 hours. - For longer storage, specimens should be frozen at
-20°C or lower. Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
Unacceptable Specimens: - Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
- Specimens not labeled with collection date and time, or patient
identification details.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• High sensitivity allergen-specific IgE immunoassay analyzer (e.g.,
ImmunoCAP, Phadia 250/1000)
• Almond allergen-specific reagent kits
• Serum separator tubes (SST)
• Calibrators and controls for quality assurance (levels high,
medium, and low)
• Laboratory consumables (pipettes, tips, tubes)
6. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
• Allow serum samples to come to room temperature before
analysis.
• Prepare all reagents, calibrators, and controls according to
manufacturer instructions.
Calibration and Quality Control:
• Calibrate the immunoassay analyzer at the beginning of the
testing day or as required by the frequency.
• Run high, medium, and low controls at each calibration and
document results in the Quality Control Log to verify the accuracy
of the calibration.
• Ensure all control values fall within the pre-established acceptable
range. Investigate and rectify any deviations before proceeding.
Sample Analysis:
1. Loading Serum Samples:
◦ Assign a unique identifier to each sample.
◦ Load serum samples along with calibrators and controls in
the specified positions on the analyzer rack.
2. Analyzing Samples:
◦ Follow manufacturer guidelines to start the analysis run.
◦ Document run start time.
3. Interpreting Results:
◦ Ensure proper function and completion of the analytical run.
◦ Review the raw data produced by the analyzer.
◦ Compare against predefined controls to ensure no outliers.
4. Validating Results:
◦ Confirm that all quality control results are within the
acceptable range.
◦ Use analyzer software to validate and export results for
each serum sample.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
• Input results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS) for
review.
• Ensure the results include the Almond IgE concentration,
reference ranges, and any relevant comments.
• All results must be reviewed and verified by a qualified
technologist before release.
• Report critical values as per laboratory guidelines, including
immediate notification to the appropriate healthcare provider if
necessary.
8. QUALITY CONTROL AND TROUBLESHOOTING
• Perform regular maintenance on the immunoassay analyzer as
per manufacturer's specifications.
• Maintain documentation of all calibrations, control runs, and
maintenance activities.
• Investigate and resolve any discrepancies or unusual findings
before results release.
• Upon identification of a point of failure in the procedure, halt all
further analysis, notify a supervisor, and undertake corrective
actions prior to resuming testing.
9. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's user manual and reagent kit inserts pertinent to
the specific immunoassay analyzer.
• Laboratory quality assurance guidelines and SOPs.
10. SAFETY AND HANDLING
• Handle all biological specimens following standard precautions.
• Dispose of all waste reagents, consumables, and samples
following biohazard regulations.
By following this SOP, laboratory personnel ensure the reliable and
accurate generation of Almond IgE Serum results, thereby
contributing to precise patient care and management.
