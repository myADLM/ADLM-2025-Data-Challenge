Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Analytical Phase
of Generating Results for Alpha-1-Acid Glycoprotein
(AAG) Analysis
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized and consistent process for the analysis of
Alpha-1-Acid Glycoprotein (AAG) in patient specimens, ensuring
accuracy and reliability of results.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Preferred Specimen Type:
• Serum is the preferred specimen for AAG analysis.
Collection and Handling:
• Collect blood in a serum separator tube (SST) or a plain red-top
tube.
• Allow blood to clot for 30 minutes at room temperature.
• Centrifuge the tube at 1500 x g for 10 minutes to separate the
serum.
• Transfer the serum to a clean, labelled aliquot tube.
Specimen Storage:
• Store serum specimens at 2-8°C if analysis is to be performed
within 72 hours.
• For longer storage, freeze at -20°C or lower.
• Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric specimens.
• Specimens collected in anticoagulant tubes (such as EDTA,
citrate, or heparin).
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Clinical chemistry analyzer capable of performing
immunoturbidimetric assays (e.g., Roche Cobas platform).
• Centrifuge
• Refrigerator and Freezer for specimen storage
• Calibrated pipettes
Reagents:
• AAG Reagent Kit (ensure in-date and properly stored as per
manufacturer's instructions).
• Calibrators for AAG analysis.
• Quality Control (QC) materials – two levels (normal and
abnormal).
• Required diluents as specified by the reagent manufacturer.
Supplies:
• Sample cups or test tubes.
• Personal protective equipment (PPE).
• Disposable gloves.
• Laboratory coat.
4. PROCEDURE
A) Calibration and Quality Control:
1. Perform calibration using the AAG Calibrators as per the
manufacturer's instructions.
2. Run QC material at the beginning of each run, after calibration,
and at designated intervals.
3. Document QC results and ensure they fall within the acceptable
range. If QC fails, investigate and resolve the issue before
proceeding with patient samples.
B) Sample Preparation:
1. Retrieve serum specimens from storage and allow to reach
room temperature.
2. Verify sample identification and documentation.
3. Mix samples thoroughly before analysis.
C) Analysis:
1. Load reagents, calibrators, QC materials, and patient samples
onto the analyzer.
2. Program the analyzer with the appropriate assay parameters as
provided in the reagent kit insert.
3. Begin the analysis run and monitor the process for any errors or
flags.
D) Post-Analysis:
1. Retrieve and evaluate results from the analyzer printout or
software.
2. Review any flagged results or error messages, and take
appropriate corrective actions.
3. Verify and document all results in the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
5. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Results are automatically transmitted to the LIS and must be
reviewed and verified by the technologist.
2. Review critical values and confirm the need for repeat testing or
verification with a supervisor.
3. Ensure all results, including any comments on sample integrity
or assay anomalies, are accurately documented in the patient's
report.
6. QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE
1. Maintain a log of daily, weekly, and monthly QC activities.
2. Perform proficiency testing as required by regulatory agencies.
3. Ensure adherence to the laboratory's overall quality
management system, including instrument maintenance
schedules and reagent lot validation.
7. METHOD LIMITATIONS
1. Ensure that results for AAG are interpreted in the context of the
clinical presentation and other laboratory findings.
2. Be aware of potential interferences such as hemolysis, lipemia,
and icterus which may affect assay accuracy.
8. REFERENCES
1. Manufacturer's instructions for AAG reagent kits.
2. Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines.
3. Relevant laboratory quality management and standard
protocols.
9. SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS
1. Wear appropriate PPE at all times during analytical procedures.
2. Follow all institutional safety protocols for the handling and
disposal of biological specimens and reagents.
RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all laboratory technologists performing the
AAG analysis to follow this SOP and ensure accurate and reliable
results. Supervisors must review and approve any deviations from
this protocol.
