Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical
Phase of Alpha-1-Antitrypsin (AAT) Testing
1. PURPOSE
This SOP establishes a standardized procedure for the analytical
phase of Alpha-1-Antitrypsin (AAT) testing to ensure accurate and
reproducible results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
All designated laboratory personnel performing AAT testing are
responsible for adhering to this procedure, ensuring data accuracy,
and implementing corrective actions if necessary.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND HANDLING
3.1. Specimen Collection:
• Preferred Specimen: Serum or Plasma.
• Collection Tubes: Use serum separator tubes (SST) or lithium
heparin tubes with gel separators.
• Volume: Minimum 3 mL of blood.
3.2. Specimen Handling:
• After collection, allow blood specimens in SST to clot for at least
30 minutes at room temperature.
• Centrifuge specimens at 1,500x g for 10 minutes.
• Serum/plasma should be separated from cells immediately after
centrifugation.
• Store serum/plasma samples at 2-8°C if analysis is to be
performed within 48 hours. For longer storage, freeze at -20°C or
lower.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
4.1. Equipment:
• Automated Immunoassay Analyzer (e.g., Roche Cobas, Beckman
Coulter)
• Centrifuge
• Refrigerators/freezers
• Micropipettes and Tips
4.2. Reagents:
• Reagent kits specific for Alpha-1-Antitrypsin quantification.
• Quality control materials, both high and low controls.
4.3. Supplies:
• SST or plasma tubes
• Disposable gloves
• Lab coats
5. PROCEDURE
5.1. Preparation:
• Ensure the immunoassay analyzer is calibrated and daily
maintenance is performed.
• Prepare reagents according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
• Allow all reagents, controls, and specimens to reach room
temperature before use.
5.2. Calibration:
• Calibrate the analyzer using the specific Alpha-1-Antitrypsin
standards provided in the reagent kit.
• Verify calibration using quality control material with known
concentrations of AAT.
5.3. Quality Control:
• Run high and low controls with each batch of patient samples.
• Document all control results; controls must be within the
acceptable range before proceeding with testing.
5.4. Analytical Procedure:
1. Sample Loading:
◦ Load patient samples, calibrators, and controls onto the
designated positions of the immunoassay analyzer.
◦ Verify sample identification with the accompanying
laboratory requisition form.
2. Assay Execution:
◦ Select the Alpha-1-Antitrypsin assay protocol on the
analyzer.
◦ Begin the assay according to the immunoassay analyzer
instructions.
3. Result Generation:
◦ The analyzer will automatically perform sample
measurement and result calculation.
◦ Review raw data and ensure all quality controls are within
the acceptable range.
5.5. Troubleshooting:
• If any control or patient sample result falls outside the acceptable
range, investigate potential sources of error, such as equipment
malfunction, reagent issues, or sample integrity.
• Repeat the assay if required and document corrective actions.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
6.1. Reviewing Results:
• Verify all patient results manually or using the laboratory
information system (LIS).
• Ensure critical results are communicated immediately to the
ordering physician according to laboratory policy.
6.2. Result Documentation:
• Record and store results in the LIS.
• Include reference intervals for Alpha-1-Antitrypsin (e.g., 100-200
mg/dL) in the report.
7. QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE
• Adhere to internal quality control protocols by running controls
after calibration and with each batch of patient samples.
• Participate in external proficiency testing programs to validate
accuracy and precision.
• Record all quality control data and review periodically to identify
trends or issues.
8. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions and package inserts for the specific
Alpha-1-Antitrypsin reagent kits.
• Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS)
documentation.
• Internal quality control logs and corrective action records.
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolysis, lipemia, or icteric samples may interfere with assay
results.
• Ensure sample integrity by following pre-analytical handling
procedures.
This SOP for Alpha-1-Antitrypsin testing is effective as of [Date] and
will be reviewed annually or whenever procedural updates are
necessary.
