Protocol for Analytical Phase of Generating Results for Alpha-1-
Antitrypsin Clearance, Feces and Serum
1. PURPOSE
This procedure outlines the steps for the analysis and generation of
results for Alpha-1-Antitrypsin (AAT) clearance in feces and serum
samples.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory staff are responsible for
performing the analysis as per this procedure. It is the responsibility
of the staff to ensure accuracy and reliability of test results, and to
identify any discrepancies or deficiencies, reporting them to the
supervisor.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen: Feces:
• Collected in a clean, sealable container.
• Must be fresh (within the last 24 hours).
• Specimens must be transported to the lab immediately, preferably
within 2 hours of collection.
Serum:
• Collected in a serum separator tube (SST - gold top).
• After collection, serum must be separated from the clot and stored
at 2-8°C until analysis.
Unacceptable Specimen Conditions:
• Feces samples older than 24 hours.
• Serum samples not properly separated from clot.
• Any samples showing signs of contamination or improper storage.
• Specimens not labelled with collection date and time.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Centrifuge
• ELISA reader
• Appropriate ELISA kit for Alpha-1-Antitrypsin
Reagents:
• ELISA kit components including standards, controls, dilution
buffers, substrate reagents, and wash solutions.
Supplies:
• Test tubes
• Pipettes and tips
• Plate shakers
• Disposable gloves
• Lab coats
1. PROCEDURE
Pre-Analytical Phase:
• Verify patient identification and specimen collection information.
• Ensure specimens comply with acceptance criteria.
• Store specimens properly until processing.
Analytical Phase: Feces:
1. Prepare fecal sample by homogenizing approximately 1-2
grams of feces with the appropriate volume of buffer specified
by the ELISA kit instructions.
2. Centrifuge the homogenized sample at 10,000 x g for 10
minutes and carefully collect the supernatant for analysis.
Serum:
1. Centrifuge blood collection tubes at 1500 x g for 10 minutes to
obtain clear serum.
2. Aliquot the serum to appropriately labelled tubes for analysis.
ELISA Procedure:
1. Set up the ELISA plate according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
2. Add standards, controls, and samples in duplicate to the
appropriate wells.
3. Incubate the plate at room temperature for the specified
duration.
4. Wash the plate thoroughly with provided wash buffer solution.
5. Add primary antibody reagent and incubate as specified.
6. Wash the plate again to remove unbound antibodies.
7. Add substrate solution and incubate until the desired color
development is achieved.
8. Terminate the reaction by adding stop solution.
9. Read the plate using an ELISA reader at the specified
wavelength (typically 450 nm).
Post-Analytical Phase:
• Calculate sample concentrations from the standard calibration
curve generated.
• Record the results and ensure they are within the validity range of
the assay.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
Quality Control Measures:
• Run positive and negative controls with each batch of samples.
• Perform duplicate testing on critical samples to ensure
reproducibility.
• Monitor for any deviations in control levels and troubleshoot as
required.
Calibration and Maintenance:
• Regularly calibrate and maintain ELISA reader as suggested by
the manufacturer.
• Perform routine maintenance on centrifuge and other equipment.
Troubleshooting:
• If sample results fall outside expected ranges, verify the quality of
reagents and sample integrity.
• Repeat testing if necessary and ensure additional controls are
within acceptable limits.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
Result Documentation:
• Review and verify results before documentation.
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS) and
ensure accuracy.
• Include any relevant comments regarding sample condition or
analytical issues encountered.
Communication of Critical Results:
• Immediate notification of clinically significant results to the
ordering physician.
• Document details of communication in laboratory records.
Reference Intervals:
• Ensure reporting of Alpha-1-Antitrypsin values within established
reference intervals provided in the ELISA kit insert.
Method Limitations:
• Refer to the ELISA kit insert for specific limitations affecting
reagent pad performance and interference.
