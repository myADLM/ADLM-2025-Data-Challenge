Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for ALPHA-1-
ANTITRYPSIN IMMUNOSTAIN, TECHNICAL
COMPONENT ONLY
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the immunohistochemical
staining of Alpha-1-Antitrypsin (AAT) in tissue sections to ensure
accurate and reproducible results for diagnosis and research
purposes.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to the technical staff in the pathology
laboratory responsible for performing immunohistochemical staining
for Alpha-1-Antitrypsin. It covers tissue processing, staining, and
quality control but does not include interpretation or reporting of
results.
3. RESPONSIBILITIES
• Laboratory Technicians/Technologists: Responsible for
performing the immunostaining procedure according to this SOP.
• Supervisors: Ensure staff compliance with the SOP and address
any issues related to the staining procedure.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Sample Type: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue
sections.
• Section Thickness: 4-5 microns.
• Control Tissue: Include positive and negative control slides with
each staining run.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Equipment: Microtome, water bath, slide warmer, fume hood,
staining rack, microscope.
• Reagents:
1. Xylene
2. Ethanol (100%, 95%, 70%)
3. Distilled water
4. Buffer solution for antigen retrieval (e.g., citrate buffer, pH
6.0)
5. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) solution (3%)
6. Blocking solution (e.g., serum-free protein block)
7. Primary antibody against Alpha-1-Antitrypsin
8. Secondary antibody (HRP-conjugated)
9. Chromogen substrate (e.g., DAB)
10. Hematoxylin
11. Mounting medium
6. PROCEDURE
6.1. Deparaffinization and Rehydration
1. Place slides in a xylene bath for 3 changes of 5 minutes each.
2. Rehydrate through graded alcohols: 100% ethanol (2 changes,
3 minutes each), 95% ethanol (2 changes, 3 minutes each),
70% ethanol (1 change, 3 minutes).
3. Rinse in distilled water for 3 minutes.
6.2. Antigen Retrieval
1. Immerse slides in preheated antigen retrieval buffer in a
pressure cooker or microwave.
2. Heat slides in antigen retrieval solution for 20 minutes.
3. Allow slides to cool to room temperature for 20 minutes.
4. Rinse in distilled water followed by buffer wash (e.g., PBS or
TBS) for 5 minutes.
6.3. Blocking Endogenous Peroxidase
1. Incubate slides in 3% hydrogen peroxide solution for 10
minutes.
2. Rinse in buffer solution for 5 minutes.
6.4. Blocking Non-specific Binding
1. Apply blocking solution to cover the tissue sections.
2. Incubate for 10 minutes at room temperature.
3. Drain excess blocking solution (do not rinse).
6.5. Primary Antibody Incubation
1. Apply primary antibody (anti-Alpha-1-Antitrypsin) diluted in
antibody diluent.
2. Incubate for 60 minutes at room temperature or overnight at
4°C.
3. Rinse in buffer solution for 5 minutes.
6.6. Secondary Antibody Incubation
1. Apply HRP-conjugated secondary antibody.
2. Incubate for 30 minutes at room temperature.
3. Rinse in buffer solution for 5 minutes.
6.7. Chromogen Development
1. Apply DAB substrate to cover the tissue sections.
2. Incubate until desired staining intensity is achieved (typically
5-10 minutes).
3. Rinse in distilled water to stop the reaction.
6.8. Counterstaining
1. Immerse slides in hematoxylin solution for 1-2 minutes.
2. Rinse in tap water for 5 minutes.
3. Optional: Differentiate in acid alcohol and blue in Scott's tap
water substitute.
6.9. Dehydration and Mounting
1. Dehydrate through graded alcohols: 70% ethanol (1 change, 2
minutes), 95% ethanol (2 changes, 2 minutes each), 100%
ethanol (2 changes, 2 minutes each).
2. Clear in xylene (3 changes, 2 minutes each).
3. Mount coverslip with appropriate mounting medium.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include a positive control tissue known to express Alpha-1-
Antitrypsin in each staining run.
• Include a negative control (primary antibody omitted) to check for
non-specific binding.
• Document any deviations and corrective actions if control results
are not as expected.
8. RECORD KEEPING
• Maintain a log of all staining runs including:
1. Date
2. Technician’s initials
3. Batch number of antibodies and reagents used
4. Results of control tissues
5. Any deviations and corrective actions taken
9. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's instructions for all reagents and antibodies used.
• Relevant laboratory guidelines and protocols for
immunohistochemistry.
10. REVIEW AND REVISION
This SOP will be reviewed annually or as necessary. Revisions will
be documented, and the updated SOP will be distributed to all
relevant personnel.
