Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase for Generating Results for
ALPHA-1-ANTITRYPSIN PHENOTYPE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
This SOP details the procedures for accurately generating Alpha-1-
Antitrypsin (A1AT) Phenotype results from serum samples. It covers
the steps from specimen preparation to result interpretation and
reporting.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel trained in the
Alpha-1-Antitrypsin Phenotyping assay.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory personnel to
ensure that the analytical processes are followed as stated in this
SOP and to maintain accurate and timely documentation.
4. DEFINITIONS
• A1AT: Alpha-1-Antitrypsin, a protein that protects tissues from
enzyme damage.
• Phenotyping: The process to determine the specific type of
alpha-1-antitrypsin protein forms present.
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Type: Serum
• Volume: Minimum of 1 mL
• Collection: Collect blood in a serum-separator tube (SST).
• Handling: Allow blood to clot at room temperature for 30 minutes
and centrifuge at 1500 g for 10 minutes. Transfer serum into a
properly labeled aliquot tube.
• Stability: Store serum at 2-8°C for up to 7 days. For longer
storage, freeze at -20°C or below.
6. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Equipment: Electrophoresis system, blotting equipment, imaging
system, centrifuge, pipettes, and disposable tips.
• Reagents:
◦ Running buffer
◦ Staining solution
◦ Destaining solution
◦ Phenotyping control serum
◦ Diluent
7. PROCEDURE
7.1. Sample Preparation
1. Thaw serum samples if stored frozen.
2. Mix the samples gently and avoid creating bubbles.
3. Dilute the serum samples in appropriately labeled tubes as
needed according to assay instructions.
7.2. Electrophoresis
1. Load the electrophoresis gel with serum samples,
phenotyping control serum, and molecular weight markers.
2. Run the electrophoresis according to the equipment
manufacturer's protocol to separate A1AT isoforms.
7.3. Transfer and Staining
1. Transfer the proteins from the gel to a nitrocellulose
membrane using the blotting apparatus as per manufacturer
instructions.
2. Stain the membrane using the prepared staining solution to
visualize the A1AT isoforms.
3. Destain the membrane to increase band clarity.
7.4. Imaging and Analysis
1. Use the imaging system to capture the stained membrane
image.
2. Analyze the patterns and intensity of bands against control
phenotyping to interpret the phenotype. Compare sample
bands with known patterns of M, S, Z, and other variants of
A1AT.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Ensure that phenotyping control serum is included in each
run to validate the assay's performance.
2. Complete regular maintenance and calibration of all used
equipment as indicated by manufacturers.
3. Log all control results and verify they meet acceptable criteria
before proceeding with patient sample analysis. Repeat the
procedure if controls are out of range.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Review the analyzed data, ensuring the interpretation is
accurate.
2. Generate a report including the A1AT phenotype (e.g., MM,
MZ, ZZ).
3. Verify the result by a trained technologist prior to releasing the
results.
4. Results are entered into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS) for reporting.
10. LIMITATIONS
1. Hemolysis, lipemia, or icterus may interfere with the assay
and should be noted.
2. Genetic variations outside the targeted phenotypes may not be
detected.
3. The accuracy of the result highly depends on the quality of the
sample and controls.
