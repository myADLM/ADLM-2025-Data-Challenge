Protocol for the Analytical Phase of Generating Results for
ALPHA-1-ANTITRYPSIN PROTEOTYPE S/Z, LC-MS/MS, Serum
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is to
outline the process for the analysis of serum samples to determine
the alpha-1-antitrypsin proteotype S and Z using Liquid
Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).
Responsibility:
The designated laboratory personnel are responsible for conducting
the analysis, ensuring the quality of results, and maintaining proper
documentation.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred Specimen:
• 3–5 mL of serum collected in a serum separator tube (SST) or red
top tube.
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Specimens collected in EDTA, citrate, or heparin tubes.
• Hemolyzed or lipemic samples.
• Specimens with improper labeling or insufficient volume.
Storage and Stability:
• Specimens should be stored at 2–8°C if analyzed within 48 hours.
• For longer storage, specimens should be frozen at -20°C or lower.
1. MATERIALS AND REAGENTS
• LC-MS/MS system
• Mobile Phase A: Water with 0.1% formic acid
• Mobile Phase B: Acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid
• LC-MS/MS columns
• Alpha-1-antitrypsin S/Z proteotype standard solutions
• Quality control materials
• Calibration standards
• Serum samples
1. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
• Centrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Micropipettes and tips
• Sample vials compatible with LC-MS/MS
• Automated liquid handler (if available)
• Data acquisition system
1. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation:
1. Thaw frozen serum samples at room temperature. Mix by
gentle inversion.
2. Centrifuge the serum samples at 1500 x g for 10 minutes to
remove particulate matter.
3. Transfer an appropriate volume of supernatant to a clean vial.
4. Add internal standard (if applicable) to each sample, calibrator,
and QC sample.
5. Vortex each vial briefly to mix.
6. Filter the prepared samples through a 0.2 µm filter before LC-
MS/MS analysis.
B. LC-MS/MS Analysis:
1. Instrument Preparation:
◦ Ensure the LC-MS/MS system is calibrated and operational.
◦ Prime the system with Mobile Phase A and Mobile Phase B.
◦ Load the sample vials into the autosampler.
2. Method Settings:
◦ Set LC-MS/MS to the appropriate method parameters for
alpha-1-antitrypsin proteotype S/Z detection.
◦ Store settings including gradient elution program, flow rate,
column temperature, and MS detection parameters.
3. Run Calibration Standards:
◦ Run calibration standards at the beginning of the batch.
◦ Create a calibration curve by plotting the known
concentrations versus the detector response.
4. QC Analysis:
◦ Run quality control samples at the beginning, middle, and
end of the batch to verify the instrument's performance and
accuracy.
5. Sample Analysis:
◦ Inject prepared serum samples into the LC-MS/MS system.
◦ Monitor and document the instrument responses for each
analyte.
C. Data Processing and Interpretation:
1. Review chromatograms and mass spectra for each sample.
2. Integrate the peaks corresponding to alpha-1-antitrypsin
proteotype S and Z.
3. Calculate the concentrations of the proteotypes using the
calibration curve.
4. Compare results with the expected retention times and mass/
charge ratios.
5. Flag any results that fall outside of the normal quality control
ranges for further review.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Review and verify results before releasing reports to the clinician.
• Include any necessary interpretive comments regarding the
alpha-1-antitrypsin proteotype S and Z levels.
1. QUALITY CONTROL AND MAINTENANCE
Quality Control:
• Perform regular instrument maintenance.
• Use quality control materials to verify system performance.
• Document all calibration, QC runs, and maintenance procedures.
Maintenance:
• Follow manufacturer’s instructions for routine maintenance of the
LC-MS/MS system.
• Schedule and document periodic calibration and performance
verification.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Reference intervals for alpha-1-antitrypsin proteotype S and Z
should be based on laboratory-specific data or literature values.
1. LIMITATIONS
• Hemolyzed or lipemic samples may interfere with accurate
detection.
• Deviation from the standard protocol may affect results.
