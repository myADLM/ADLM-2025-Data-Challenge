Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for ALPHA-1-
ANTITRYPSIN, RANDOM, FECES
1. PURPOSE To provide a detailed procedure for the analytical
phase of generating results for Alpha-1-antitrypsin (A1AT) levels in
random fecal specimens. This procedure ensures the accurate and
reliable measurement of A1AT, which is crucial for diagnosing and
monitoring patients with conditions like Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency.
2. SCOPE This SOP applies to all clinical laboratory personnel
responsible for performing and reporting Alpha-1-Antitrypsin,
Random, Feces test in the clinical laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITIES Designated laboratory personnel are
responsible for:
• Performing the analysis according to the outlined procedure.
• Documenting all steps performed and results obtained.
• Reporting any anomalies or deviations to the supervisor.
Laboratory supervisors are responsible for:
• Ensuring all personnel are adequately trained.
• Reviewing and verifying the results.
4. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Centrifuge
• Microcentrifuge tubes
• Calibrated pipettes and pipette tips
• Alpha-1-antitrypsin assay kits
• Fecal specimen containers
• Personal protective equipment (gloves, lab coat, eye protection)
• Reagent controls (positive and negative)
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS Preferred: Random feces collected
in a clean, dry container without preservatives. Unacceptable:
• Specimens in containers with preservatives.
• Specimens contaminated with urine or water.
• Specimens that are not properly labeled or that miss the collection
date.
6. PROCEDURE
6.1. Preparation of Reagents
• Ensure all reagents and controls are at the appropriate storage
temperature as per manufacturer's instructions.
• Prepare reagent solutions and calibrators according to the
manufacturer’s guidelines.
6.2. Specimen Preparation
• Document the receipt of the fecal specimen with the appropriate
details (patient ID, date, and time).
• Homogenize the fecal sample to ensure uniformity.
• Transfer a homogenized aliquot into a microcentrifuge tube.
• Centrifuge the sample at 2500 rpm for 10 minutes to separate the
solid waste from the supernatant.
• Carefully pipette the supernatant into a clean microcentrifuge tube
for analysis.
6.3. Assay Procedure
• Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for the specific Alpha-1-
Antitrypsin assay kit used.
• Add reagent, controls, and patient samples as per the
instructions.
• Incubate the samples at the specified temperature and time.
• Measure the absorbance/optical density using the specified
wavelength on the plate reader or other analytical instruments
specified by the assay’s protocol.
• Run appropriate controls with each batch of tests to ensure assay
validity.
6.4. Quality Control
• Perform quality control checks using the provided positive and
negative controls.
• Ensure the control results are within the acceptable range before
proceeding with the patient samples.
• If control results are not within an acceptable range, re-calibrate
the instrument, prepare fresh reagents, and repeat the assay.
7. RESULTS RECORDING AND REPORTING
• Record all results, including control results, in the designated
laboratory information system (LIS).
• Verify results with the expected reference ranges:
◦ Reference Interval: Negative
• Review and sign off the results.
• Report any critical or anomalous values immediately to the
designated personnel or referring physician.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Potential interferences or limitations should be checked within the
reagent kit’s manufacturer instructions.
• Verify the specimen integrity before running the assay as
contamination may affect the reliability of the test results.
9. SAFETY AND DISPOSAL
• Follow all standard laboratory safety protocols, including wearing
appropriate PPE.
• Dispose of all biological and chemical wastes in compliance with
local and federal regulations.
10. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions for Alpha-1-antitrypsin assay kit.
• Laboratory’s quality control protocol.
11. REVISION HISTORY
• Document any revisions made to this SOP, with dates and
description of changes.
By following this SOP, laboratory personnel can ensure the accurate
and reliable analysis of Alpha-1-antitrypsin levels in random fecal
specimens, and thereby support the diagnosis and management of
relevant clinical conditions.
