STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP) Title: Analytical
Phase Protocol for Measuring Alpha-1-Antitrypsin (AAT), Serum
1. PURPOSE
To provide detailed instructions for the analytical phase of measuring
Alpha-1-Antitrypsin (AAT) levels in serum specimens. This ensures
consistent, accurate, and reliable results.
1. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel involved in the analysis
of serum AAT levels.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
• Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing and
documenting the testing procedure.
• Supervisory personnel are responsible for reviewing results and
ensuring adherence to this SOP.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
A. Specimen Type: - Serum
B. Collection: - Collect blood in a serum separator tube (SST). - Allow
the blood to clot by leaving it undisturbed at room temperature for 30
to 60 minutes. - Centrifuge for 10 minutes at 1000-1500 x g within 2
hours of collection.
C. Specimen Volume: - Minimum of 1 mL of serum.
D. Storage: - Serum samples should be stored at 2-8°C if analysis
will be done within 7 days. - For long-term storage, freeze at -20°C or
lower for up to 3 months.
E. Unacceptable Conditions: - Severely hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric
samples. - Specimens collected in anticoagulants other than clot
activator (SST).
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
A. Equipment: - Centrifuge - Pipettes and tips - Refrigerated storage -
ELISA reader or nephelometer (as per methodology employed)
B. Reagents: - AAT assay kit (store and handle as per manufacturer's
instructions) - Calibrators (store and handle as per manufacturer's
instructions) - Quality control materials at two levels (store and
handle as per manufacturer's instructions)
C. Supplies: - Serum separator tubes (SST) - Clean, dry, labeled test
tubes or microfuge tubes
1. CALIBRATION AND QUALITY CONTROL
A. Calibration: - Perform calibration with every new kit lot or as
required by the manufacturer. - Utilize calibrators provided with the
kit. - Follow the specific calibration procedure as outlined by the kit
manufacturer. - Document calibration results and ensure they are
within acceptable ranges.
B. Quality Control: - Run quality control materials at two levels (high
and low) with each batch of patient samples. - Evaluate quality
control results before reporting patient results. - Repeat any assays
where quality control fails. - Document control results and any
corrective actions taken.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Pre-analytical Preparation: - Ensure all reagents are prepared and
instruments are calibrated as per manufacturer instructions. - Allow
any frozen serum specimens to thaw completely, mix gently, and
centrifuge if necessary to clarify.
B. Analytical Procedure:
A. ELISA Method:
1. Pre-warm ELISA plate and reagents to room temperature.
2. Add standards, controls, and patient serum samples to the designated wells.
3. Follow incubation and washing steps as per kit insert.
4. Add detection antibody followed by substrate solution.
5. Measure absorbance at the specified wavelength using an ELISA reader.
6. Calculate AAT concentrations using a standard curve derived from the absorbance values of the standards.
B. Nephelometric Method:
1. Pre-warm reagents and allow them to reach room temperature if required.
2. Prepare and load serum samples, calibrators, and controls onto the nephelometer.
3. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for operating the nephelometer and performing the assay.
4. Measure the light scatter and calculate AAT concentration based on calibration curve.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Record results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Ensure all results comply with established reference ranges and
laboratory guidelines.
• Any atypical or critical values should be immediately brought to
the attention of the supervisor and reported as per laboratory
protocols.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Typically, reference intervals for Alpha-1-Antitrypsin: 100-200 mg/
dL.
• Reference intervals may slightly vary with different assay
methods. Verify against the specific kit insert.
1. POST-ANALYTICAL PROCEDURES
• Dispose of biohazardous waste in accordance with institutional
safety policies.
• Decontaminate work areas and equipment.
• Document and archive the analytical run for future reference.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS AND INTERFERENCE
Refer to the specific assay kit manufacturer's insert for limitations and
potential interferences that may affect the results.
