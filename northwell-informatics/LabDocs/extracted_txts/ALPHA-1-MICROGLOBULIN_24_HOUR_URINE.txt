STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE
Title: Analytical Phase for Generating Results for Alpha-1-
Microglobulin, 24 Hour, Urine
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this procedure is to outline the steps
required for the analytical phase of generating results for Alpha-1-
Microglobulin in a 24-hour urine specimen. This protocol ensures
accurate and reliable results that are crucial for patient diagnosis and
treatment.
2. SCOPE This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel
responsible for the analysis of Alpha-1-Microglobulin in 24-hour urine
specimens.
3. RESPONSIBILITY All designated laboratory personnel performing
the analysis are responsible for adhering to this SOP. The laboratory
supervisor must ensure that all personnel are adequately trained and
compliant with this protocol.
4. DEFINITIONS Alpha-1-Microglobulin: A low molecular weight
protein, the measurement of which in urine helps in assessing renal
tubular function and detecting tubular proteinuria.
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
5.1 Collection
• Preferred: 24-hour urine collection.
• Collection container: A large, clean container without
preservatives for collecting the 24-hour urine sample.
5.2 Acceptable/Unacceptable Conditions
• Acceptable: Properly labeled specimens collected accurately over
a 24-hour period.
• Unacceptable: Specimens not covering the entire 24-hour period
or contaminated samples.
6. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
6.1 Equipment
• Centrifuge
• Refrigerator for specimen storage
• Pipettes
• Analytical balance
6.2 Reagents
• Alpha-1-Microglobulin test kit (Refer to specific manufacturer
instructions)
• Calibrators and controls
• Diluent solution if required
6.3 Supplies
• Pipette tips
• Test tubes
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
7. PROCEDURE
7.1 Specimen Preparation
1. Mix the 24-hour urine sample thoroughly.
2. Measure the total volume of urine collected.
3. Record the total volume for reporting purposes.
4. Aliquot a portion of the mixed urine into a test tube for analysis.
7.2 Analytical Procedure
1. Centrifuge the aliquoted sample at 1500 rpm for 10 minutes to
remove particulate matter.
2. Follow manufacturer instructions for the Alpha-1-Microglobulin
test kit: a. Set up the assay plate according to the
manufacturer's guidelines. b. Prepare the calibrators, controls,
and urine samples. c. Add the required volume of samples and
reagents into the assay plate wells. d. Incubate the plate as per
the manufacturer's instructions. e. Measure the absorbance
using a microplate reader.
3. Run quality control samples with each batch of patient samples
to ensure the accuracy of results.
7.3 Calculations
1. Use the calibration curve obtained by plotting the known
concentrations of the calibrators to determine the concentration
of Alpha-1-Microglobulin in the urine samples.
2. Calculate the 24-hour excretion of Alpha-1-Microglobulin by
multiplying the concentration obtained by the total urine volume
of 24-hour collection.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Utilize the appropriate quality control materials provided with
the assay to verify the accuracy and precision of the test.
2. Document all control results in the Quality Control Log.
3. Troubleshoot any control deviations before proceeding with
patient samples.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Ensure all calculations and results are reviewed and verified by
a qualified technologist.
2. Report results in mg/24 hours.
3. Record critical findings and report immediately to the
supervising clinician.
10. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Reference intervals for Alpha-1-Microglobulin should be obtained
from the test kit manufacturer or relevant clinical guidelines.
11. METHOD LIMITATIONS Refer to the manufacturer's insert for
any limitations related to the Alpha-1-Microglobulin assay.
