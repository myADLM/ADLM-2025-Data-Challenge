Title: Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Alpha-1-Microglobulin,
Random, Urine
1. PURPOSE
To establish a standardized procedure for the analysis and reporting
of Alpha-1-Microglobulin (A1MG), Random Urine using immunoassay
technology. This procedure aims to ensure the accuracy and
reliability of results used in the clinical assessment of kidney function.
1. SCOPE
This protocol applies to all laboratory personnel involved in the
analysis of Alpha-1-Microglobulin in random urine samples within the
laboratory.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the laboratory personnel to follow this
procedure rigorously and effectively. The designated laboratory
supervisor is responsible for monitoring the performance and
ensuring compliance with this SOP.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type: Random urine collected in a sterile container.
Specimen Stability:
• Room Temperature: 2 hours
• Refrigerated (2-8°C): 24 hours
• Frozen (-20°C or colder): 1 month
Handling: Immediately after collection, specimens should be
refrigerated if they are not going to be analyzed within 2 hours. For
long-term storage, specimens should be aliquoted and frozen.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens with visible contaminants or particulates
• Specimens not kept under appropriate storage conditions
• Specimens with insufficient volume for analysis
• Hemolyzed or clotted specimens
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Immunoassay analyzer (model specific)
• Micropipettes and disposable tips
• Vortex mixer
• Centrifuge
• Refrigerator (2-8°C)
• Freezer (-20°C or colder)
Reagents:
• Alpha-1-Microglobulin reagent kit
• Calibration standards
• Quality control materials (high and low levels)
• PBS solution (phosphate-buffered saline)
Supplies:
• Sterile sample vials
• Disposable gloves
• Laboratory coat
• Absorbent bench pads
• Specimen racks
• Waste disposal containers
1. PROCEDURE
6.1 Calibration and Quality Control
1. Calibration:
◦ Run calibration on the immunoassay analyzer according to
the manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Use the calibration standards provided in the A1MG reagent
kit.
◦ Document calibration curves and verify that they are
acceptable before running patient samples.
2. Quality Control:
◦ Run quality control material at the beginning of each shift,
after calibration, and after every 20 samples.
◦ Use both high and low control materials.
◦ Record QC results and ensure they fall within the
established acceptable range before proceeding with the
analysis of patient specimens.
◦ If QC results are out of range, troubleshoot according to the
analyzer’s manual and verify results before proceeding.
6.2 Analytical Procedure
1. Pre-Analytical Preparation:
◦ Retrieve the urine sample from storage.
◦ Verify the patient information on the sample container
matches the requisition form.
◦ Vortex the urine sample gently to ensure homogeneity.
◦ If particulates are present, centrifuge the sample at 3000
rpm for 10 minutes and use the supernatant.
2. Sample Loading:
◦ Label reagent tray and sample cups appropriately.
◦ Aliquot 50 µL of urine sample into the designated sample
cup.
◦ Place the sample cups into the analyzer.
3. Running the Assay:
◦ Follow the immunoassay analyzer’s instructions for running
Alpha-1-Microglobulin.
◦ Load reagent trays and reagents as per the manufacturer's
guidelines.
◦ Start the analysis cycle on the analyzer.
◦ Monitor the run for any warnings or errors.
4. Result Interpretation:
◦ Upon completion, retrieve results from the immunoassay
analyzer.
◦ Verify that control values are within range.
◦ Record the Alpha-1-Microglobulin concentration in mg/L.
5. REPORTING RESULTS
6. Verification:
◦ Ensure that all patient results are reviewed for any technical
errors or abnormal findings.
◦ Verify that patient test results are accurate and reliable
based on control sample analysis.
7. Documentation:
◦ Document results electronically in the Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
◦ Include any necessary comments related to sample integrity
and result interpretation.
8. Reporting:
◦ Transmit verified results to the appropriate healthcare
provider within the stipulated turn-around time (TAT).
9. REFERENCE INTERVAL
Reference intervals for random urine Alpha-1-Microglobulin will be
provided by the reagent manufacturer or established in-house based
on the validation study results.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the reagent kit insert for limitations that may affect the
accuracy and precision of the test. Interference may occur with high
concentrations of other urinary proteins, hemoglobin, or due to highly
diluted/contaminated specimens.
