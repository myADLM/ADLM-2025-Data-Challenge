Protocol for the Analytical Phase of Generating Results for
ALPHA-2-MACROGLOBULIN, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this protocol is to establish a standardized procedure
for the analysis of Alpha-2-Macroglobulin in serum samples. This
protocol ensures accurate, precise, and consistent results, adhering
to CLIA standards.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
A. Preferred Specimen:
- Serum collected in a red-top tube or SST (serum separator tube).
- Minimum volume: 1 mL serum.
B. Unacceptable Specimen:
- Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
- Specimens collected in anticoagulant tubes (e.g., EDTA, heparin).
- Specimens that have been stored for more than 48 hours at room temperature or more than 5 days at 2-8°C.
3. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
- Clinical chemistry analyzer (capable of performing immunoassay methods).
- Calibrators and controls specific to Alpha-2-Macroglobulin assay.
- Pipettes and tips.
- Analyzer-specific reagents and consumables.
- Timer.
- Reagent storage at 2-8°C.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
A. Perform quality control with each batch of tests.
B. Use two levels of commercially available control material (normal and abnormal).
C. Document control results and ensure they are within the acceptable range before analyzing patient samples.
D. Investigate and resolve any out-of-range control results before proceeding.
5. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation:
1. Allow serum samples to come to room temperature before analysis if previously refrigerated or frozen.
2. Ensure all reagents and consumables are within their expiration dates.
B. Calibration:
1. Calibrate the analyzer according to the manufacturer's instructions using the provided calibrators.
2. Verify calibration status and ensure it is current.
C. Loading Samples:
1. Label the sample tubes with unique identifiers that correspond to the laboratory information system (LIS) requisition.
2. Load the samples onto the analyzer according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
D. Running the Assay:
1. Select the assay protocol for Alpha-2-Macroglobulin on the analyzer.
2. Input the appropriate patient and sample information into the analyzer.
3. Run the assay following the manufacturer’s instructions.
E. Reviewing Results:
1. Upon completion of the assay, review the results for any flags or error messages.
2. Check the quality control results for the run to ensure they are within acceptable limits.
3. Evaluate the patient results. If control results are within range, proceed with result validation.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
A. Review the generated data on the laboratory information system (LIS).
B. Validate and verify the accuracy of results.
C. Report the validated results to the referring physician according to the laboratory's reporting guidelines.
D. Document and log all results, calibrations, and quality control information.
7. REFERENCE INTERVALS
- Refer to the specific instrument and assay kit instructions for the reference intervals, which may vary by laboratory and population.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
- Refer to the specific manufacturer's instructions for information on the limitations of the assay, including potential interferences.
9. TROUBLESHOOTING
- Follow all instrument-specific troubleshooting procedures for any errors or discrepancies.
- If issues persist, contact the instrument manufacturer's technical support for further guidance.
