Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analysis of Alpha-2
Plasmin Inhibitor Levels in Plasma
1. PURPOSE
To accurately and consistently measure Alpha-2 Plasmin Inhibitor
levels in plasma samples using an immunoassay technique.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of the laboratory staff to perform the analysis
accurately following this SOP, document all findings, and ensure the
correct reporting of the results.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
a) Specimen type: Blood plasma b) Collection: Blood should be
collected into a 3.2% sodium citrate tube and mixed promptly to
prevent clotting. c) Volume: A minimum of 1.0 mL of plasma is
required. d) Stability: Plasma samples should be tested within 4
hours of collection. If testing cannot be performed within this time
frame, plasma should be separated and stored frozen at -20°C or
lower. Samples are stable for up to one month when stored frozen.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, icteric, or lipemic samples.
• Samples not collected or stored under the acceptable conditions
noted.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Immunoassay analyzer
• Alpha-2 Plasmin Inhibitor reagent kit
• Calibrators and controls
• Refrigerated centrifuge
• Micropipettes and tips
• Polypropylene tubes for sample storage
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
1. PROCEDURE
a) Preparation:
• Bring all reagents, controls, and samples to room temperature
(20-25°C) before use.
• Ensure the immunoassay analyzer is calibrated and quality
control checks have been performed as per the manufacturer’s
guidelines.
b) Sample processing:
• Centrifuge blood specimens for 15 minutes at 1500-2000 x g to
obtain plasma.
• Carefully transfer the plasma into fresh labeled polypropylene
tubes.
• If plasma samples are frozen, thaw them rapidly in a water bath at
37°C for no more than 10 minutes, then keep them at room
temperature until analysis.
c) Analysis:
• Set up the assay according to the manufacturer's instructions
provided with the Alpha-2 Plasmin Inhibitor reagent kit.
• Pipette the appropriate volumes of calibrators, controls, and
plasma samples into the designated wells on the assay tray.
• Follow the incubation and washing steps exactly as specified in
the kit insert.
• Measure the absorbance or signal using the immunoassay
analyzer.
d) Quality Control:
• Run quality control samples with each batch of patient samples.
• Document all control values and ensure they fall within the
acceptable range before reporting patient results.
• If controls are out of range, investigate potential causes, re-
calibrate the analyzer, and re-run the controls.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Calculate the concentration of Alpha-2 Plasmin Inhibitor in patient
samples based on the standard curve generated from the
calibrators.
• Ensure all results are manually or automatically transcribed into
the Laboratory Information System (LIS) for verification.
• Flag any patient results that fall outside the reference interval.
• Review all results for accuracy and consistency before formal
reporting.
Reference Interval:
• Alpha-2 Plasmin Inhibitor: 81-149% of normal
Critical Results:
• Alpha-2 Plasmin Inhibitor below 25%: Critical low, require
immediate communication to the ordering physician.
1. SAMPLE INTEGRITY
Maintain the integrity of plasma samples throughout the process.
Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles. Visually inspect samples for clots,
hemolysis, or lipemia and note any sample limitations.
