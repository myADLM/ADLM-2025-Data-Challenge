Procedure for the Analysis of Alpha-Amylase and IgE in Serum
1. Purpose This procedure outlines the steps for analyzing alpha-
amylase and IgE levels in serum specimens. These
measurements are crucial for diagnosing and monitoring
pancreatic diseases, allergies, and other conditions.
2. Specimens
◦ Preferred Specimen: Serum, collected in a red-top or
serum separator tube (SST).
◦ Volume: A minimum of 1.0 mL of serum is required for both
alpha-amylase and IgE assays.
◦ Unacceptable Specimens: Hemolyzed, lipemic, and icteric
samples may interfere with the assay results and should be
avoided.
3. Reagents and Supplies
◦ Test kits and reagents specific for alpha-amylase and IgE
(follow manufacturer’s guidelines).
◦ Controls and calibrators.
◦ Distilled water or deionized water for reagent preparation.
◦ Micropipettes with disposable tips.
◦ Centrifuge.
◦ Incubator.
◦ Analytical balance.
◦ Appropriate PPE (Personal Protective Equipment).
4. Quality Control
◦ Run controls (positive and negative) each day of testing
before running patient specimens.
◦ Ensure all reagents and controls are within their expiration
dates.
◦ Document control values in the quality control log.
5. Procedure
A) Preparation
◦ Allow all specimens, controls, and reagents to reach room
temperature before testing.
◦ Ensure all equipment, such as the incubator and centrifuge,
is in proper working condition.
◦ Include procedural blanks where applicable.
B) Centrifugation
◦ Centrifuge the serum samples at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes to
obtain a clear supernatant.
◦ Ensure no cells are present in the serum used for testing.
C) Alpha-Amylase Analysis
i. Reagent Preparation: - Prepare reagents as per
manufacturer’s instructions. This includes enzyme substrates,
buffers, and any additional required solutions.
ii. Assay Setup: - Pipette the designated volume of reactive
reagent into labeled wells or cuvettes. - Add the serum
specimen to the corresponding well or cuvette. - Add controls
and calibrators to designated wells or cuvettes. - Mix gently to
avoid bubbles.
iii. Incubation: - Incubate the wells or cuvettes at 37°C for the
required time as specified in the kit protocol.
iv. Measurement: - Measure the absorbance or other specified
signal using the appropriate instrument. - Record the readings
accurately.
v. Calculation and Interpretation: - Follow the kit instructions
for result calculation, including any necessary corrections for
controls. - Compare with reference intervals: - Normal range for
alpha-amylase: 30 – 110 U/L.
D) IgE Analysis
i. Reagent Preparation: - Prepare reagents as per
manufacturer’s instructions. This includes enzyme conjugates,
wash buffers, and detection solutions.
ii. Assay Setup: - Pipette the designated volume of coated
microwell reagents into the wells of the assay plate. - Add the
serum specimen to the corresponding wells. - Add controls and
calibrators to their designated wells. - Mix gently.
iii. Incubation and Washing: - Incubate the plate at room
temperature for the required time. - Wash the wells thoroughly
with wash buffer to remove unbound components.
iv. Detection: - Add the enzyme conjugate reagent to each well.
- Incubate the plate further if required. - Add the substrate
solution for enzymatic reaction. - Measure the absorbance at
the appropriate wavelength using a plate reader.
v. Calculation and Interpretation: - Follow the manufacturer’s
calculation procedures to determine IgE concentrations. -
Compare with reference intervals: - Normal range for IgE: <100
IU/mL.
6. Reporting Results
◦ Validate all results against quality control data.
◦ Record results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS),
ensuring no transcription errors.
◦ Flag any abnormal results for review.
7. Safety and Handling
◦ Use PPE appropriately, including gloves, lab coat, and eye
protection.
◦ Handle all biological samples and reagents as potential
biohazards.
◦ Dispose of biohazard waste in appropriate containers.
8. Troubleshooting and Corrective Action
◦ Ensure all instruments are calibrated.
◦ If control values are out of range, re-check reagent
preparation, instrument calibration, and control materials.
◦ Document any corrective actions taken.
