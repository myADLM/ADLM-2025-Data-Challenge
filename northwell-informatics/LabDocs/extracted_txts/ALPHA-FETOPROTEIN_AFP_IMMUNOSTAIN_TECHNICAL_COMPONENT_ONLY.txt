ALPHA-FETOPROTEIN (AFP) IMMUNOSTAIN, TECHNICAL
COMPONENT ONLY SOP
1. PURPOSE
This procedure outlines the steps for performing the Alpha-
Fetoprotein (AFP) immunostain in the laboratory, specifically for the
technical component. AFP is used primarily in the diagnosis of liver
cancer, germ cell tumors, and in monitoring treatment efficacy. The
procedure ensures accurate and reproducible results.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the AFP
immunostain according to this SOP. All anomalies and issues must
be reported to the laboratory supervisor.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Type:
• Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections or cytology
specimens.
Quantity:
• Standard: one slide per test.
Pre-treatment:
• Ensure tissue/cytology samples are properly fixed and embedded.
• Slides should be deparaffinized and rehydrated through graded
alcohol series prior to staining.
1. MATERIALS REQUIRED
• AFP primary antibody (validated source)
• Positive and negative control slides
• Immunohistochemistry staining system (automated preferred)
• Peroxidase block
• Secondary antibody/enzyme conjugate
• Buffered substrate solution for chromogen development
• Wash buffers, mounting medium, and cover slips
• Incubator set at optimal temperature for incubation steps (room
temperature or 37°C based on antibody protocol)
1. PROCEDURE
A. Slide Preparation:
1. Label slides appropriately with patient identifiers and test
specifics.
2. Place slides in a staining rack.
B. Deparaffinization and Rehydration (if not pre-treated):
1. Immerse slides in xylene for 3 minutes, twice.
2. Move slides through 100%, 95%, 80% alcohol for 2 minutes
each.
3. Rinse slides in distilled water.
C. Antigen Retrieval: (if required) Perform heat-induced epitope
retrieval if necessary as per antibody datasheet recommendations.
D. Blocking Steps:
1. Apply peroxidase block and incubate for 10 minutes to minimize
nonspecific staining.
2. Rinse slides in wash buffer for 1 minute.
E. Primary Antibody Incubation:
1. Apply AFP primary antibody to each slide and incubate for the
time specified by the antibody manufacturer (usually 30 minutes
to 1 hour).
2. Rinse slides in wash buffer for 1 minute.
F. Secondary Antibody Incubation:
1. Apply the secondary antibody/enzyme conjugate to the slides
and incubate as directed.
2. Rinse slides in wash buffer for 1 minute.
G. Chromogen Development:
1. Apply substrate solution (e.g., DAB) and incubate until color
development is observed (usually 5-10 minutes).
2. Rinse slides in distilled water to stop reaction.
H. Counterstaining:
1. Immerse slides in hematoxylin for 1 minute to counterstain.
2. Rinse slides in tap water followed by a quick dip in 0.1% acid
alcohol.
3. Wash slides thoroughly in tap water and then distilled water.
I. Dehydration:
1. Move slides through graded alcohol series (80%, 95%, 100%)
for 1 minute each.
2. Immerse in xylene for 2 minutes.
J. Mounting:
1. Apply mounting medium and cover slips. Allow slides to dry
adequately.
2. QUALITY CONTROL
A. Positive and Negative Controls:
1. Always include positive and negative control slides with each
batch of staining.
2. Check control slides to ensure staining quality and specificity.
B. Verification:
1. Review all stained slides to ensure target antigens are correctly
visualized.
2. Verify stain quality against control slides.
C. Maintenance:
Ensure all reagents, particularly antibodies, are within expiry dates
and stored per manufacturers’ recommendations.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
This SOP covers the technical component only. Interpretations and
final result reporting are performed by qualified pathologists/
histotechnologists.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Interpretive criteria should be covered separately and adhere to
established histopathological guidelines.
1. LIMITATIONS
Refer to antibody datasheet for limitations regarding tissue types,
fixatives used, and specific performance characteristics.
