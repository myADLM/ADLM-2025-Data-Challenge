Protocol for the Analytical Phase of Generating Results for
ALPHA-FETOPROTEIN (AFP) L3% AND TOTAL,
HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA TUMOR MARKER, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
To provide standardized procedures for the quantification and
analysis of Alpha-Fetoprotein (AFP) L3% and Total, which are
hepatocellular carcinoma tumor markers in serum samples, ensuring
consistency, accuracy, and reliability of laboratory test results.
Responsibility
Laboratory technologists and designated staff who are appropriately
trained and certified to analyze AFP L3% and Total will conduct this
protocol. It is their responsibility to ensure accuracy, precision, and to
follow quality assurance procedures as outlined in this document.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type:
• Preferred: Serum
Specimen Collection and Transport:
• Collect blood samples using standard venipuncture technique.
• Allow blood to clot at room temperature before centrifugation.
• Centrifuge and separate serum within 2 hours of collection.
• Store serum at 2-8°C if not immediately tested. For long-term
storage, freeze serum at -20°C or lower.
• Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles, as they may affect the stability
of AFP biomarkers.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens with severe hemolysis, lipemia or icterus.
• Specimens collected in inappropriate tubes (e.g., EDTA, sodium
citrate).
• Specimens that have not been stored or transported under
required conditions.
3. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
• Access to automated immunoassay analyzers compatible with
AFP assays (e.g., Roche Elecsys, Abbott ARCHITECT).
• Calibrators and controls specific to the assay being used.
• Serum separator tubes (SSTs) or red-top tubes without
anticoagulants.
• Standard laboratory equipment: centrifuge, pipettes, and
appropriate clinical-grade disposables.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
Materials:
• Commercially available AFP control materials at different levels
(low, medium, and high).
Frequency:
• Perform QC testing at the beginning of each shift, with each batch
of samples, and after any maintenance or calibration of the
instrument.
• Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for QC and maintain
documentation logs.
Procedure:
• Thaw control materials appropriately if frozen and bring them to
room temperature.
• Mix well before use.
• Run the controls according to the assay protocol.
• Compare the results to the established control ranges.
• Investigate and address any QC failures before proceeding with
patient samples.
5. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation for Analysis:
1. Thaw any necessary calibrators and controls if they are stored
frozen.
2. Bring all reagents, calibrators, controls, and serum samples to
room temperature.
3. Check the inventory of consumables and ensure the instrument
is properly maintained and calibrated.
B. Assay Procedure:
1. Calibrate the analyzer according to the manufacturer’s
instructions with the appropriate AFP L3% and total AFP
calibrators.
2. Load the serum samples, calibrators, and controls into the
instrument.
3. Select the assay protocols for AFP L3% and total AFP.
4. Initiate the assay run, ensuring to input the correct identification
for each sample.
C. Analyte Measurement:
1. The instrument will measure the concentration of AFP L3% and
total AFP in each serum sample.
2. Quality control results must be reviewed to ensure they are
within acceptable ranges before patient results are validated.
D. Troubleshooting:
• If any sample results fall outside the calibration range, dilute the
sample accordingly and re-run the test.
• If control results are not within acceptable limits, recalibrate the
instrument and re-run controls before processing any patient
samples.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Review the instrument printout or digital results.
2. Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
3. Ensure all results are correctly associated with the patient’s
identification.
4. Validate and review the results for any potential outliers or
anomalies.
7. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• AFP Total: < 10 ng/mL (Note: Reference interval may vary
according to the population studied and the methodology used.)
• AFP L3%: Typically provided by the assay manufacturer due to
different potential cut-offs based on the kit and equipment used.
Refer to the specific insert for detailed ranges.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the specific assay kit insert for limitations including potential
interferences (e.g., heterophile antibodies, rheumatoid factors).
9. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions for the specific AFP assay kit.
• Relevant clinical guidelines and studies on AFP usage in
hepatocellular carcinoma.
10. RECORD KEEPING
• Maintain comprehensive logs of QC results, calibrator usage,
patient results, and any troubleshooting or maintenance
performed.
By adhering to this protocol, we ensure that AFP L3% and total AFP
results are reliable and accurate, aiding in the diagnosis and
monitoring of hepatocellular carcinoma.
