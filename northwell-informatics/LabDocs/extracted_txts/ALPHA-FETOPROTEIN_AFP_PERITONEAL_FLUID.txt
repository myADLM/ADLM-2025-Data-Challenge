SOP: Analytical Phase of Generating Results for ALPHA-
FETOPROTEIN (AFP), PERITONEAL FLUID
1. PURPOSE
This document describes the standard procedures to be followed for
the accurate and efficient analysis of Alpha-Fetoprotein (AFP) in
peritoneal fluid specimens. This ensures consistency in specimen
processing, testing, and generation of results adhering to CLIA
guidelines.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all designated laboratory personnel
involved in the analysis of AFP in peritoneal fluid at a CLIA-certified
laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITIES
• Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for carrying out
the analytical procedures as described in this SOP.
• It is the responsibility of the laboratory supervisor to ensure
adherence to this SOP, troubleshoot any issues, and verify
results.
4. SAFETY PRECAUTIONS
• Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) such as
gloves, lab coat, and safety goggles.
• Handle all biological specimens as potentially infectious materials
following universal precautions.
• Dispose of waste in accordance with the laboratory's biohazard
disposal guidelines.
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen Type:
• Peritoneal fluid, collected in a sterile container.
Sample Collection:
• Peritoneal fluid should be collected aseptically and promptly
transported to the laboratory.
• Maintain specimens at 2-8°C if there is any delay in processing.
Stability at refrigerated temperature should be verified.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens that are hemolyzed, clotted, contaminated, or
improperly labeled.
• Specimens received in non-sterile or incorrect containers.
6. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• AFP assay platform (e.g., ELISA reader, Chemiluminescent
Immunoassay system)
• Incubators (as required by the procedure)
Reagents:
• Manufacturer's AFP assay kit specific for peritoneal fluid
• Calibrators and controls
• Dilution buffers and wash solutions
Supplies:
• Sterile sample tubes
• Labeling materials
• PPE
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform quality control (QC) with each batch of tests using at
least two levels of controls (low and high) as per the
manufacturer's specification.
• Check and document QC results before running patient samples.
QC must be within acceptable limits.
• Record any QC failures and corrective actions taken. Do not
report patient results until QC issues are resolved.
8. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Ensure all equipment is calibrated and verified as operational
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Thaw samples if previously frozen and bring them to room
temperature.
3. Mix the samples gently by inversion or using a mechanical
mixer.
Testing:
1. Centrifuge all peritoneal fluid samples at 1500xg for 10 minutes
at room temperature to remove cellular debris.
2. Aspirate the supernatant carefully without disturbing the cell
pellet. Transfer to a clean, labeled sample tube.
3. Prepare the assay reagents and plates according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
4. Pipette the appropriate volume of standards, controls, and
patient samples into designated wells on the assay plate.
5. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for incubation times,
wash steps, addition of reagents, and reading results.
Reading and Calculation:
1. Read the assay plate in the appropriate instrument (e.g.,
microplate reader for ELISA at specified wavelength).
2. Plot the calibration curve using the standards and calculate the
concentration of AFP in each patient sample based on the
curve.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
• Review all data for accuracy and consistency.
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
ensuring patient identifiers and results are correctly matched.
• Include reference intervals for AFP in peritoneal fluid if
established, or indicate the interpretation in the report.
• Flag any critical values according to laboratory protocol and notify
the appropriate healthcare provider promptly.
10. MAINTENANCE AND TROUBLESHOOTING
• Regularly maintain and calibrate instruments according to the
manufacturer’s guidelines.
• Document any equipment malfunctions and corrective actions
taken.
• In case of discrepancies, recheck specimens, controls, and
reagents. Perform reruns if necessary.
11. DOCUMENTATION
• Record all steps and results including any deviations from the
protocol.
• Maintain logs for QC, calibration, and equipment maintenance.
• Ensure completed reports are signed off by a qualified laboratory
professional before release.
12. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s package insert and assay instructions for the AFP
test kit being used.
• CLIA guidelines for laboratory testing.
• Laboratory-specific policies and procedures manual.
13. APPROVAL
• This protocol must be reviewed and approved by the Laboratory
Supervisor and the Quality Assurance Officer.
