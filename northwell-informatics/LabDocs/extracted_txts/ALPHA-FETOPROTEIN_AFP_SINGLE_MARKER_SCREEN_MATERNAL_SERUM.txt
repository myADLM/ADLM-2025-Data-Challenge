Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Alpha-Fetoprotein
(AFP) Single Marker Screen, Maternal, Serum
1. PURPOSE
This document outlines the standard operating procedure (SOP) for
generating results for Alpha-Fetoprotein (AFP), Single Marker
Screen, Maternal, Serum. This SOP aims to ensure the accurate,
consistent, and reliable analysis and reporting of AFP levels in
maternal serum samples.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel involved in the
analysis of AFP in maternal serum samples in the designated CLIA-
certified laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all laboratory personnel to adhere to the
procedures outlined in this SOP. The laboratory supervisor is
responsible for ensuring compliance with this procedure and
addressing any issues that arise during the analytical process.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
4.1. Preferred Specimen:
• Maternal serum collected in serum separator tubes (SST) or plain
red-top tubes.
• Collect 5-10 mL of blood and allow it to clot at room temperature.
• Centrifuge the sample within 2 hours of collection to separate the
serum.
• Transfer the serum to a properly labeled secondary tube if
necessary.
4.2. Unacceptable Specimen:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric specimens.
• Specimens received in tubes other than SST or plain red-top
tubes.
• Specimen volume less than 2 mL.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
5.1. Equipment:
• Automated immunoassay analyzer capable of AFP analysis (e.g.,
Beckman Coulter, Siemens, Roche).
• Centrifuge.
• Pipettes and tips.
• Refrigerator/freezer for reagent and sample storage.
5.2. Reagents:
• AFP calibrators.
• AFP control materials.
• AFP reagent kits (specific to the immunoassay analyzer used).
5.3. Supplies:
• Serum separator tubes (SST) or plain red-top tubes.
• Sample cups or tubes compatible with the immunoassay analyzer.
• Labels and markers for specimen identification.
6. PROCEDURE
6.1. Preparation:
1. Ensure that the immunoassay analyzer is properly calibrated
and that the AFP reagent kit is valid and within the expiration
date.
2. Verify that all control materials are prepared and ready for use.
6.2. Sample Analysis:
1. Label all sample tubes with patient identifiers.
2. Check specimen integrity and reject any unacceptable
specimens.
3. Prepare sample cups/tubes, if necessary, and program the
analyzer with appropriate patient information.
4. Load the samples, calibrators, and control materials onto the
analyzer as per the manufacturer's instructions.
5. Start the analysis according to the analyzer's operating
procedure.
6.3. Quality Control:
1. Run quality control (QC) materials alongside patient samples to
ensure test accuracy.
2. Document the QC results and verify that they fall within
acceptable limits before releasing patient results.
6.4. Result Verification:
1. Review the analyzer printout or digital results for each patient
sample.
2. Verify that each result is consistent with the expected ranges
and QC results.
3. Investigate and resolve any discrepancies or outliers.
6.5. Reporting Results:
1. Document patient results in the laboratory information system
(LIS).
2. Generate a final report, ensuring all relevant patient identifiers
and result data are accurate.
3. Results must include AFP levels (ng/mL or IU/mL) and the
corresponding reference interval for the gestational age.
7. REFERENCE INTERVALS
AFP Levels:
• Reference intervals vary by gestational age. Refer to the specific
immunoassay analyzer's package insert for the appropriate
reference ranges.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to the manufacturer’s package insert and user manual for
limitations specific to the immunoassay analyzer used.
9. QUALITY CONTROL AND CALIBRATION
9.1. Calibration:
• Perform calibration of the immunoassay analyzer as per the
manufacturer's instructions.
• Use calibrators provided with the AFP reagent kit.
9.2. Quality Control:
• Run daily controls at multiple levels (e.g., low, medium, high) to
ensure assay performance.
• Document and review control results before patient sample
analysis.
10. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s package insert and user manual for the specific
immunoassay analyzer.
• Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines.
• Laboratory internal quality control documentation and SOPs.
11. REVISION HISTORY
• Document any changes or updates to this SOP. Include the date,
nature of the change, and the person responsible for the update.
By following this SOP, laboratory personnel will ensure accurate and
consistent results for Alpha-Fetoprotein (AFP) Single Marker Screen,
Maternal, Serum, maintaining the highest standards of quality and
reliability.
