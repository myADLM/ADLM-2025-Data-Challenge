Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Alpha-Fetoprotein (AFP) Testing, Spinal Fluid
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to define the process for the
analysis of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) in spinal fluid specimens to
ensure reliable and accurate results.
Responsibility:
• It is the responsibility of the trained laboratory personnel to
perform the AFP assay according to the instructions specified in
this protocol.
• Supervisors are responsible for verifying the accuracy and
precision of the test results and ensuring adherence to the
protocol.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND HANDLING
Specimen Type:
• Spinal fluid (CSF)
Specimen Collection:
• Collect CSF in a sterile, leak-proof container as per standard
collection procedures. Avoid contamination or exposure to
preservatives.
Specimen Storage:
• Store specimens at 2-8°C if analysis will be performed within 48
hours.
• If storage exceeds 48 hours, freeze the specimen at -20°C or
lower.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens with visible hemolysis.
• Specimens stored at room temperature for more than 2 hours.
• Specimens with overt contamination or that are improperly
labeled.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• AFP Immunoassay Kit (for spinal fluid)
• Calibrators and Controls provided by kit manufacturer
• Micropipettes and tips (appropriate volumes as specified by the
kit)
• Centrifuge (if required for separation of cellular elements)
• Plate reader capable of reading the specific assay format (e.g.,
ELISA reader)
• Incubator (if applicable)
• Vortex mixer
• Refrigerated storage units (2-8°C and -20°C)
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) such as lab coat, gloves,
and safety goggles
1. PROCEDURE
A) Pre-Analytical Preparation
1. Verify the integrity of the specimen. Ensure it meets the
acceptance criteria mentioned above.
2. Allow frozen specimens to thaw at room temperature or per
manufacturer's instructions.
3. Vortex the specimen to ensure complete mixing before
analysis. Centrifuge if necessary.
B) Reagent Preparation
1. Prepare the reagents, calibrators, and controls as per the
instructions in the AFP assay kit. Bring all reagents and
specimens to room temperature before use.
C) Assay Procedure
1. Pipette the required volume of calibrators, controls, and
specimens into designated wells of the assay plate.
◦ Follow the exact volumes specified in the assay kit
instructions.
2. Add the assay-specific reagents to each well in the order
described by the manufacturer.
3. Incubate the plate at the required temperature and duration as
detailed in the assay protocol.
4. After incubation, perform wash steps to remove unbound
materials using the wash buffer provided in the kit.
5. Add the detection reagent(s) and incubate for the specified
duration.
6. Measure the absorbance (optical density) at the wavelength
specified by the assay kit using an ELISA reader.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
8. Perform assays with both positive and negative controls to
ensure assay performance.
9. Calibrate the assay plate reader before each use according to
the manufacturer's instructions.
10. Use internal quality control materials to assess the reliability
and accuracy of the assay at the beginning and end of each
run.
11. Document and monitor control results closely. If controls fall
outside of the acceptable range, do not release patient results;
identify and resolve the issue following troubleshooting
guidelines.
12. INTERPRETATION AND REPORTING OF RESULTS
13. Absorbance readings are compared against the standard curve
generated from calibrators to determine the AFP concentration
in patient samples.
14. Results are reported in ng/mL or other units as defined by the
assay kit.
15. Refer to the laboratory’s reporting guidelines for the standard
reference interval.
16. If results fall outside the measurable range, reassay the
specimen using an appropriate dilution within the linear range.
17. METHOD LIMITATIONS
18. Refer to the AFP assay kit insert for limitations related to the
assay’s performance characteristics and potential interferences.
19. Interpretation of AFP levels should always consider the clinical
context and other diagnostic tests.
