Standard Operating Procedure
(SOP) for ALPHA-
FETOPROTEIN (AFP), TUMOR
MARKER
1. PURPOSE
This protocol outlines the procedure for the analysis of Alpha-
Fetoprotein (AFP) as a tumor marker from the receipt of the
specimen in the laboratory to the reporting of results to ensure the
accuracy, reliability, and timeliness of test results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of designated laboratory staff to perform the
AFP testing according to this SOP and ensure that the results are
accurately documented and reported. The supervisor is responsible
for the oversight of the process and for addressing any technical
issues that may arise.
3. DEFINITION
Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) is a glycoprotein produced primarily by the
fetal liver. It is used as a tumor marker, particularly for liver cancer
(hepatocellular carcinoma) and testicular cancer.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/Acceptable Specimens:
• Serum: Collect blood in a plain red-top or serum separator tube
(SST).
• Plasma: Collect blood in a heparinized vacutainer.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed samples.
• Frozen serum or plasma.
• Specimens collected in tubes containing additives such as EDTA
or sodium fluoride.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND
SUPPLIES
• AFP Tumor Marker Assay Kit (specific to the instrument used,
e.g., Roche Elecsys AFP assay).
• Calibrators and controls as provided by the manufacturer.
• Automated chemiluminescence immunoassay analyzer (e.g.,
cobas e 411 analyzer).
• Pipettes and tips.
• Centrifuge.
6. PROCEDURE
Sample Preparation:
1. Ensure that the collected specimen is properly labelled and
matches the requisition form.
2. Allow the blood to clot for 30 minutes at room temperature.
3. Centrifuge the specimen at 1500-2000 x g for 10 minutes to
separate serum/plasma.
4. Transfer the serum/plasma to a labelled secondary tube.
Calibration and Quality Control:
1. Calibration: Perform calibration using appropriate calibrators
according to the manufacturer's instructions. Use a new
calibration curve if the previous one is outdated or if there is a
significant deviation in quality control results.
2. Quality Control: Run quality control samples (low and high)
daily. Ensure that the QC results are within the specified range
before processing patient samples.
Assay Procedure:
1. Load the prepared samples, calibrators, and quality control
materials onto the automated analyzer.
2. Program the analyzer according to the manufacturer’s
instructions to run the AFP assay.
3. Start the analysis and monitor the instrument for any error
messages or issues.
Result Interpretation and Reporting:
1. Results are automatically transmitted to the Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
2. Review and verify the results for each sample. Any result falling
outside the established reference range or showing suspicious
patterns should be flagged for review.
3. Critical results must be reported immediately to the requesting
physician following established protocols for communication
and documentation of critical values.
7. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Adult (non-pregnant):
• Male: < 8 ng/mL
• Female: < 8 ng/mL
Reference interval may vary by method and individual patient's
clinical condition; consult the assay kit manufacturer’s instructions for
specific intervals.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the assay kit manufacturer’s insert for detailed limitations
including interferences, cross-reactivity, and assay specificity.
9. QUALITY CONTROL
Use appropriate quality control materials to ensure the accuracy of
the assay. Record and monitor QC results daily. If QC results fall
outside acceptable limits, identify and correct the issue before
proceeding with patient samples.
10. REPORTING RESULTS
Results must be reviewed, verified, and transmitted to LIS. Provide a
numerical result for AFP concentration in ng/mL. Flag and document
any critical values as per the laboratory’s protocols.
