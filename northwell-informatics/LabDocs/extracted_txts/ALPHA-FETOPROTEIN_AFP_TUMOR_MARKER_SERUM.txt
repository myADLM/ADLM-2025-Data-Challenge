SOP for Alpha-Fetoprotein (AFP) Tumor Marker, Serum
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedures for conducting Alpha-Fetoprotein (AFP)
Tumor Marker assays in serum to ensure accurate, reliable, and
timely results. This SOP describes the proper handling, preparation,
and analysis of serum samples for AFP measurement using
immunoassay techniques.
RESPONSIBILITY: It is the responsibility of all designated laboratory
staff to follow this procedure as outlined below. Supervisors must
ensure that the staff adheres to these procedures and address any
deviations promptly.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred Specimen:
• Serum collected in a red top or serum separator tube (SST).
• Minimum volume required: 0.5 ml serum.
• Specimens should be centrifuged, and serum separated within 2
hours of collection.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples as these may interfere with
the assay.
• Specimens not properly labeled or without a proper requisition
form.
• Samples that have not been stored or transported correctly.
• Specimens collected in anticoagulant tubes (EDTA, Citrate, etc.).
Storage and Stability:
• Serum samples are stable for 24 hours at room temperature
(15-25°C).
• Stable for 7 days when refrigerated (2-8°C).
• For long-term storage, freeze at -20°C or below. Avoid repeated
freeze-thaw cycles.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• Immunoassay analyzer (e.g., Roche Elecsys, Siemens ADVIA
Centaur).
• Specific AFP reagent kits compatible with the analyzer.
• Calibrator and control materials.
• Transfer pipettes, sample cups, and disposable gloves.
• Centrifuge and serum separator tubes.
• Laboratory information system (LIS).
1. PROCEDURE
4.1 Sample Preparation: a. Confirm that the serum samples meet the
acceptance criteria. b. Equilibrate frozen samples to room
temperature and mix gently before testing. c. If refrigerated, allow the
samples to reach room temperature before testing.
4.2 Calibration: a. Refer to the manufacturer's instruction for
performing calibration. b. Calibrate the instrument using the calibrator
provided in the AFP reagent kit. c. Calibration should be performed
according to the manufacturer’s guidelines or whenever a new lot of
reagents is introduced.
4.3 Quality Control: a. Perform QC using control materials with low,
medium, and high AFP levels before running patient samples. b.
Compare control results to established control values. c. Document
all QC results in the appropriate log. d. If QC results fall outside the
acceptable range, take corrective actions as per manufacturer’s
instructions and laboratory protocols before analyzing patient
samples.
4.4 Sample Analysis: a. Load prepared serum samples into the
sample rack of the immunoassay analyzer. b. Program the analyzer
with the patient sample identification, sample types, and necessary
tests. c. Initiate the analysis process as per the manufacturer's
guidelines.
4.5 Interpretation of Results: a. The analyzer will process the
samples and display AFP concentrations in IU/mL (International Units
per Milliliter). b. Apply the reference interval specified by the
laboratory or as provided by the reagent manufacturer. c. The typical
normal range for adults is: <10 ng/mL (Note: Reference ranges may
vary; confirm with the manufacturer’s guidelines, especially for
pediatric patients or specific conditions).
1. REPORTING RESULTS
a. All results must be reviewed and verified by the technologist. b.
Results outside the reference range must be checked and, if
necessary, the sample should be reanalyzed. c. For critical AFP
values (e.g., >200 IU/mL), follow the laboratory's critical result
reporting guidelines.
1. QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE
• Calibration and maintenance of the immunoassay analyzer as per
manufacturer’s instructions.
• Regular proficiency testing to ensure consistent and accurate AFP
measurements.
• Proper documentation of all calibration, QC, and patient results.
1. MAINTENANCE AND TROUBLESHOOTING
• Follow the manufacturer’s maintenance schedule for routine
upkeep of the analyzer.
• In case of instrument malfunction, notify the supervisor and
document the issue.
• Troubleshoot as per the manufacturer’s guidelines. If unresolved,
contact technical support.
