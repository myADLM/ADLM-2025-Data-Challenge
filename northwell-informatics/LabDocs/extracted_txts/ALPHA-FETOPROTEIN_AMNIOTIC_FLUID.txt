Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analysis of Alpha-
Fetoprotein (AFP) in Amniotic Fluid
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the analysis of Alpha-
Fetoprotein (AFP) in amniotic fluid to ensure accurate and reliable
test results. AFP testing in amniotic fluid is performed for prenatal
screening, particularly to detect neural tube defects and other fetal
conditions.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel involved in the
analysis of AFP in amniotic fluid in the Laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
Laboratory technologists are responsible for performing and
documenting the analysis. Supervisors are responsible for reviewing
and verifying the results and taking corrective action when necessary.
4. REAGENTS AND EQUIPMENT
• AFP Test Kit (e.g., ELISA, chemiluminescent assay)
• Microplate Reader (if using ELISA)
• Centrifuge
• Micropipettes and disposable pipette tips
• Calibrated volumetric flasks and measuring equipment
• Laboratory timer
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
• Deionized water
• Amniotic Fluid Control Materials
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen:
• Preferred: Amniotic fluid collected by amniocentesis.
• Volume: Minimum of 1 mL of amniotic fluid.
• Storage: Store at 2-8°C immediately upon collection. If not tested
within 24 hours, freeze the specimen at -20°C or colder.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens that are hemolyzed, contaminated, or improperly
labeled.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
Materials:
• Control materials: High and low AFP concentrations.
• External quality control materials may be included as applicable.
Frequency:
• Quality control samples should be run with each batch of patient
samples.
Procedure:
1. Prepare quality control samples according to manufacturer
instructions.
2. Include quality control samples at the beginning and end of
each run.
3. Document all quality control results in the log.
7. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Wear appropriate PPE (lab coat, gloves, safety glasses).
2. Set up the work area with all required reagents and equipment.
Analyte Measurement:
1. Thaw the amniotic fluid samples (if frozen) and allow them to
come to room temperature.
2. Vortex the samples gently to ensure homogeneity.
3. Prepare the AFP test kit and reagents following the
manufacturer’s instructions.
4. Pipette the appropriate volume of standards, controls, and
patient samples into the designated wells on the microplate.
5. Add the appropriate reagents to each well according to the
assay protocol.
6. Incubate the microplate for the specified time periods at the
specified temperatures as directed by the assay.
7. Wash the microplate wells thoroughly after each incubation step
as instructed.
8. Add the detection reagent and incubate as required.
9. Measure the optical density (OD) of each well using a
microplate reader set to the appropriate wavelength (usually
around 450 nm).
10. Calculate the AFP concentration in the amniotic fluid samples
using the standard curve generated from the assay standards.
8. RESULT INTERPRETATION AND REPORTING
1. Review the quality control results to ensure they are within the
acceptable range. If controls are out of range, investigate and
resolve any issues before proceeding with patient sample
results.
2. Compare patient sample results to reference values provided
by the assay manufacturer, taking into consideration gestational
age-specific reference ranges for AFP in amniotic fluid.
3. Document the results, including gestational age, in the
laboratory information system (LIS).
4. Report results according to laboratory protocols, ensuring they
include necessary interpretive comments and follow-up
recommendations.
5. Notify the healthcare provider of any critical or abnormal results
as per established protocols.
9. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Utilize the gestational age-specific reference intervals for AFP
levels in amniotic fluid as provided in the assay kit insert or
laboratory-specific guidelines.
10. TROUBLESHOOTING AND LIMITATIONS
1. Confirm that all reagents are within their expiration dates and
have been stored correctly.
2. Ensure that all pipettes and equipment have been properly
calibrated and maintained.
3. If a sample’s result is inconsistent with clinical findings, consider
re-testing the sample or consulting with a supervisor.
4. Be aware of potential interferences such as hemolysis,
contamination, or improper sample collection/handling.
