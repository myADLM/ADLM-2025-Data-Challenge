Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) for ALPHA-FUCOSIDASE,
LEUKOCYTES
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this protocol is to outline the procedures for the
analytical phase of alpha-fucosidase testing in leukocytes. This
protocol ensures the precision, accuracy, and reliability of the test
results and maintains compliance with CLIA regulations.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing alpha-
fucosidase testing in leukocytes as outlined in this SOP. It is the
responsibility of all laboratory personnel to identify deficiencies in the
testing process and bring them to the attention of a supervisor.
Supervisors are accountable for ensuring that all testing procedures
are conducted properly and documented accordingly.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred Specimen:
• Leukocytes isolated from freshly drawn venous blood
• Blood collected in anticoagulant (e.g., heparinized vacutainer)
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Specimens not processed within the outlined stability window
• Specimens collected in incorrect anticoagulant
• Specimens with visible clotting
• Specimens with significantly hemolyzed blood
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Centrifuge (for leukocyte isolation)
• Bright-line hemocytometer
• Microscope
• Alpha-fucosidase assay kit (commercially available)
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Test tubes and racks
• Buffer solution (as specified in the assay kit)
• Incubator
• Timer
5. PROCEDURE
A) Leukocyte Isolation:
1. Collect blood in a heparinized vacutainer.
2. Centrifuge blood sample at 1500-2000 RPM for 10 minutes to
separate plasma.
3. Carefully aspirate the buffy coat layer containing leukocytes into
a clean test tube.
4. Wash leukocytes with buffer solution and centrifuge again to
obtain a clean pellet.
B) Alpha-Fucosidase Assay:
1. Label all test tubes with patient identification and date.
2. Prepare reagents as specified in the alpha-fucosidase assay kit
instructions.
3. Pipette isolated leukocytes into the wells of the assay plate or
test tubes.
4. Add assay reagents, including substrates and buffers, to the
leukocyte samples following the kit instructions.
5. Incubate samples at the temperature specified in the assay kit
instructions.
6. After incubation, measure the reaction product as directed (e.g.,
spectrophotometric or fluorometric method).
7. Record readings and compare with calibration standards and
controls.
8. If the test results fall within the diagnostic range, accept and log
results. If results are outside acceptable limits, perform
troubleshooting steps and notify the supervisor.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Quality control materials (positive and negative controls) must be
included in each assay run.
• Maintain records of control readings to ensure consistency and
reliability.
• Perform internal and external quality control checks regularly to
validate the assay accuracy.
• Document discrepancies and corrective actions as per laboratory
protocol.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
• Enter result readings into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
• Verify and review all results before approving them for release.
• Ensure critical results are communicated immediately to the
responsible healthcare provider following the repeat critical values
guidelines.
8. REFERENCE INTERVAL
• Establish reference intervals specific to alpha-fucosidase levels in
leukocytes based on assay kit documentation and clinical
validation data.
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to the assay kit insert for detailed limitations regarding
reagent pad sensitivity and specificity.
