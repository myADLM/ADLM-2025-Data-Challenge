Standard Operating Procedure for Alpha-Galactosidase, Blood
Spot Analysis
1. PURPOSE
This protocol outlines the procedure for the analysis of Alpha-
Galactosidase (α-GAL A) enzyme activity in dried blood spots to
diagnose Fabry Disease or monitor its treatment. This document is
intended to ensure consistency and reliability of results.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all personnel performing Alpha-
Galactosidase testing in the biochemical genetics department.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
Laboratory technologists are responsible for performing the assay
and ensuring that all steps are followed meticulously. The laboratory
supervisor is responsible for overseeing the procedure and
addressing any issues that may arise.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/Acceptable:
• Dried blood spot (DBS) collected on a Guthrie card (Whatman
903 or equivalent).
• The spot must be completely saturated with blood and allowed to
dry at room temperature for at least 3 hours.
• Samples should be stored at room temperature and tested within
7 days of collection for optimal results.
Unacceptable:
• Insufficient blood volume on the card.
• Hemolyzed, clotted, or improperly dried specimens.
• Specimens not labeled with collection date/time.
5. REAGENTS AND MATERIALS
Equipment:
• Incubator set at 37°C.
• Microplate reader capable of measuring absorbance at 515 nm.
• Vortex mixer.
• Centrifuge.
• Pipettes and tips.
Reagents:
• Alpha-Galactosidase substrate (4-methylumbelliferyl-α-D-
galactopyranoside).
• Alpha-Galactosidase buffer solution.
• Enzyme dilution buffer.
• Stop solution (0.2 M Glycine buffer, pH 10.4).
• Calibration standards and quality control materials.
• Sample preparation reagents including extraction buffer (0.1 M
phosphate buffer, pH 6.5).
6. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Document the receipt of the DBS samples in the laboratory
information system.
2. Allow DBS samples and all reagents to reach room temperature
before beginning the assay.
Sample Extraction:
1. Punch out one 3-mm disk from the center of each blood spot
into a 96-well plate.
2. Add 100 µL of extraction buffer to each well containing a DBS
punch.
3. Seal the plate with aluminum foil and incubate at 37°C for 2
hours with gentle shaking.
Assay Setup:
1. Prepare working substrate solution by diluting the Alpha-
Galactosidase substrate to the required concentration in the
buffer solution.
2. Add 50 µL of the working substrate solution to each well of a
new 96-well plate.
Enzyme Reaction:
1. Transfer 50 µL of the extracted sample from the sample
preparation plate to the corresponding wells in the assay plate.
2. Incubate the plate at 37°C for 1 hour.
3. After incubation, stop the reaction by adding 200 µL of stop
solution to each well.
Reading the Plate:
1. Measure the fluorescence at an excitation wavelength of 360
nm and emission wavelength of 450 nm using a microplate
reader. Alternatively, measure absorbance at 515 nm if
appropriate.
Calculation of Results:
1. Generate a standard curve using the calibration standards.
2. Calculate the enzyme activity in each sample based on the
standard curve.
3. Report results in units of nmol/h/mL of blood.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Include internal QC samples with each run:
◦ Normal control.
◦ Deficient control.
2. Controls should fall within pre-established ranges for the run to
be considered valid.
3. Document all QC results and take corrective actions if controls
are out of the acceptable range.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Review all results for accuracy and completeness.
2. Enter results into the laboratory information system for review
and final approval by the supervisor.
3. Critical results should be communicated immediately to the
requesting physician or clinic.
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Ensure specimens are collected, stored, and transported under
proper conditions to avoid compromising the test results.
• Incomplete drying or contamination of the sample may lead to
inaccurate results.
• Interferences from hemolysis, lipemia, or medications should be
taken into consideration.
10. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions for Alpha-Galactosidase substrate kit.
• Laboratory quality assurance and control protocols.
• Relevant peer-reviewed literature on enzyme activity assays for
Alpha-Galactosidase.
11. DOCUMENTATION AND RECORD KEEPING
1. Maintain detailed records of all sample processing and results
in the laboratory information system.
2. Keep records of all QC and calibration data.
12. SAFETY AND COMPLIANCE
1. Follow all laboratory safety guidelines, including the use of
personal protective equipment (PPE).
2. Handle biological specimens following standard precautions to
prevent the transmission of infectious agents.
3. Dispose of all waste materials according to biosafety and
hazardous waste regulations.
