Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase:
Alpha-Galactosidase, Leukocytes
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized protocol for generating accurate and
reproducible results for alpha-galactosidase in leukocytes. This
procedure ensures the timely and correct processing of specimens,
the use of appropriate reagents and equipment, and documentation
of results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of designated laboratory personnel to perform
all steps of the procedure as outlined, document all relevant
information, and report any inconsistencies or issues to the
supervisor.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred Specimen:
• Whole blood collected in EDTA (lavender-top) tube.
• 5 mL of blood is minimum; 10 mL is preferred for thorough
analysis.
Specimen Stability:
• Store whole blood at 2-8°C if not processed immediately.
• Specimens should be processed within 24 hours of collection for
optimal enzyme activity.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Centrifuge
• Refrigerated centrifuge
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Vortex mixer
• Incubator set at 37°C
• Alpha-galactosidase assay kit (including all necessary reagents)
• Leukocyte lysis buffer
• Microplate reader equipped for fluorescence detection
• EDTA tubes
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
5. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Preparation
1. Leukocyte Isolation:
◦ Centrifuge the whole blood sample at 3000 rpm for 10
minutes at 4°C.
◦ Carefully remove the plasma and buffy coat layer to obtain
the leukocytes.
◦ Wash the leukocytes twice with PBS (Phosphate-Buffered
Saline) to remove any remaining plasma and red blood
cells.
◦ Count and suspend the leukocytes in leukocyte lysis buffer
as per the alpha-galactosidase assay kit instructions.
2. Lysis of Leukocytes:
◦ Incubate the leukocyte suspension at 37°C for 30 minutes,
then vortex briefly.
◦ Centrifuge the lysate at 10,000 rpm for 5 minutes to remove
cell debris.
◦ Collect the supernatant, which contains the enzyme alpha-
galactosidase.
B. Enzyme Assay
1. Reagent Preparation:
◦ Prepare all reagents as per the instructions provided with
the alpha-galactosidase assay kit.
◦ Ensure reagents are at room temperature before use.
2. Assay Setup:
◦ In a microplate, add the prepared reagent mix according to
the kit instructions.
◦ Add the leukocyte lysate (supernatant) to each well in
duplicate or triplicate for accuracy.
◦ Include wells for positive and negative controls as provided
in the kit.
3. Incubation:
◦ Incubate the microplate at 37°C for the time specified by the
assay kit (commonly 1-2 hours).
◦ Protect the plate from light during incubation if using a
fluorescence-based detection method.
4. Measurement:
◦ After incubation, measure the fluorescence intensity (or
absorbance if specified) using a microplate reader.
◦ Record the readings for each well.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Internal Quality Control:
◦ Run positive and negative controls with each batch of tests
to ensure assay validity.
◦ Use quality control materials with known alpha-
galactosidase activity levels to verify the assay
performance.
◦ Repeat any assays that fall outside acceptable control limits.
2. Documentation:
◦ Record all readings, control results, and any observations in
a lab notebook or electronic system.
◦ Document any deviations from the procedure, including
troubleshooting steps taken if results are unexpected.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
• Calculate the enzyme activity (e.g., nmol/hour/mg protein) as
specified in the assay kit instructions.
• Enter the results into the laboratory information system (LIS) for
clinical interpretation and reporting.
• Review and verify results before releasing them to ensure they
meet established quality criteria.
