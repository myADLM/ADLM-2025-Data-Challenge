Analytical Phase Protocol for
ALPHA-GALACTOSIDASE,
SERUM
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this protocol is to outline the procedures for the
analytical phase of generating results for Alpha-Galactosidase activity
in serum samples. This protocol ensures accurate, reliable, and
timely results to aid in the diagnosis of Fabry disease and other
conditions associated with deficient or altered alpha-galactosidase
activity.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for conducting the assay
and documenting the results according to this protocol. The
laboratory supervisor is responsible for ensuring adherence to the
protocol and troubleshooting any issues that arise during the
analytical phase.
3. DEFINITIONS
• Alpha-Galactosidase: An enzyme involved in the breakdown of
glycolipids in the body, deficiencies of which can lead to Fabry
disease.
• Serum: The liquid portion of the blood that remains after clotting
has taken place, devoid of cells and clotting factors.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND
STABILITY
• Preferred specimen: Venous blood collected in a serum separator
tube (SST).
• Minimum volume: 0.5 mL of serum.
• Specimen stability:
◦ Refrigerated (2-8°C): stable for 7 days.
◦ Frozen (-20°C): stable for 1 month.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND
SUPPLIES
• Alpha-Galactosidase assay kit
• Spectrophotometer capable of measuring absorbance at specific
wavelengths (as per assay kit instructions)
• Micropipettes and tips
• Timer
• Vortex mixer
• Centrifuge
• Calibrated refrigerator and freezer for specimen storage
• Laboratory-grade detergent and deionized water for cleaning
equipment
6. PROCEDURE
Sample Preparation
1. Thawing and Handling:
◦ If the serum sample is frozen, thaw it rapidly at room
temperature and mix gently by inversion.
◦ Ensure that the sample is free of clots or particulate matter.
2. Aliquoting:
◦ Using a micropipette, aliquot the required volume of serum
into a clean, labeled microcentrifuge tube.
Assay Setup
1. Reagent Preparation:
◦ Follow the instructions provided in the Alpha-Galactosidase
assay kit for preparing reagents. Ensure all reagents are at
the correct temperature and thoroughly mixed.
2. Blank and Standard Preparation:
◦ Prepare a blank using the assay diluent.
◦ Prepare standards according to the manufacturer's
instructions to generate a standard curve.
Assay Execution
1. Pipetting:
◦ Pipette the serum samples, blanks, and standards into the
designated wells of the assay plate or test tubes according
to the assay kit instructions.
2. Reagent Addition:
◦ Add the appropriate volume of reagent to each well/tube
containing the samples, blanks, and standards.
3. Incubation:
◦ Incubate the assay plate/tubes as per the recommended
conditions (temperature and time) specified in the assay kit
instructions.
4. Detection:
◦ Measure the absorbance or fluorescence (depending on the
assay type) using the spectrophotometer at the specified
wavelength.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run quality control samples (low, medium, high) with each batch
of patient samples.
• Ensure that the quality control results fall within the established
acceptable range. If QC results are outside the acceptable range,
troubleshoot and repeat the assay.
• Document all QC results and any corrective actions taken.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Calculate alpha-galactosidase activity using the absorbance
readings and the standard curve generated.
• Document the results in the laboratory information system (LIS).
• Interpret the results according to established reference intervals
and clinical guidelines.
• For any critical results or discrepancies, notify the appropriate
medical personnel immediately.
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolyzed or lipemic samples may interfere with the assay
results.
• Ensure proper calibration and maintenance of equipment to avoid
variability in results.
• Refer to assay kit insert for specific limitations related to enzyme
stability and reagent compatibility.

Document any deviations from the protocol and notify the supervisor
for review and corrective actions. This protocol ensures consistent
and reliable results for Alpha-Galactosidase activity in serum
samples, aiding in the accurate diagnosis and monitoring of patients.
