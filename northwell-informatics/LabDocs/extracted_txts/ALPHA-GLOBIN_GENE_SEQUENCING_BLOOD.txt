Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Alpha-Globin Gene
Sequencing, Blood
I. PURPOSE This protocol outlines the standard procedures for
performing alpha-globin gene sequencing on blood samples to
ensure the accurate detection of mutations in the alpha-globin gene.
II. PRINCIPLE Alpha-globin gene sequencing is utilized to identify
mutations that can cause alpha-thalassemia or related
hemoglobinopathies. DNA is extracted from the blood sample,
amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and then sequenced
to identify any mutations.
III. SCOPE This SOP is applicable to the clinical laboratory
performing alpha-globin gene sequencing on blood samples.
IV. RESPONSIBILITY Designated laboratory staff are responsible for
adhering to this procedure, ensuring proper sample handling,
performing pre-analytical and analytical procedures, and
documenting and reviewing results.
V. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
1. Specimen Type: Whole blood
2. Collection Container: EDTA (lavender-top) tube
3. Volume: Minimum 2 mL of whole blood
4. Handling and Storage:
◦ Store whole blood at 2-8°C if there is a delay before
processing.
◦ Specimens should be processed within 48 hours of
collection.
VI. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
1. Equipment:
◦ Refrigerated centrifuge
◦ Micropipettes and tips
◦ PCR thermocycler
◦ DNA sequencer (e.g., Sanger sequencer)
◦ Electrophoresis apparatus
◦ Computer and software for sequence analysis
2. Reagents:

polymerase, dNTPs, buffer)
◦ Sequencing reagents (BigDye terminator, sequencing
buffer)
◦ Gel electrophoresis reagents (agarose, ethidium bromide or
SYBR safe)
VII. PROCEDURE
1. DNA Extraction
◦ Isolate genomic DNA from 2 mL of whole blood using a
validated DNA extraction kit.
◦ Quantify extracted DNA by spectrophotometer (e.g.,
NanoDrop) and assess quality by agarose gel
electrophoresis.
2. PCR Amplification of Alpha-Globin Gene
◦ Prepare the PCR master mix in a clean area to prevent
contamination. Include the specific primers for targeting the
alpha-globin gene regions.
◦ Mix DNA template (20-100 ng), PCR master mix, and water
to the final reaction volume.
◦ PCR conditions: Initial denaturation at 95°C for 5 minutes,
followed by 35 cycles of denaturation at 95°C for 30
seconds, annealing at 58°C for 30 seconds, and extension
at 72°C for 1 minute, with a final extension at 72°C for 7
minutes.
3. Gel Verification of PCR Products
◦ Run 5 µL of PCR product on a 1.5% agarose gel stained
with ethidium bromide or SYBR safe.
◦ Visualize bands under UV light.
4. Sequencing Prep and Clean-Up
◦ Clean the PCR products using a commercial PCR clean-up
kit.
◦ Prepare sequencing reactions using BigDye terminator
cycle sequencing kit according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
◦ Perform sequencing reaction with an initial denaturation at
96°C for 1 minute, followed by 25 cycles of 96°C for 10
seconds, 50°C for 5 seconds, and 60°C for 4 minutes.
5. DNA Sequencing and Data Analysis
◦ Purify sequencing reaction products using a commercial
purification kit.
◦ Run purified sequencing products on a DNA sequencer.
◦ Analyze sequence data with appropriate software (e.g.,
Sequencing Analysis Software).
◦ Compare sequence data with reference sequences to
identify mutations.
VIII. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Control Samples
◦ Include positive and negative control DNA samples in each
batch of tests.
◦ Confirm that controls give expected results before accepting
test results.
2. Reagent Monitoring
◦ Maintain reagent log and ensure reagents are within
expiration dates.
◦ Validate new lots of critical reagents (e.g., primers,
sequencing kit) before use.
3. Calibration and Maintenance
◦ Regularly calibrate equipment (e.g., thermocycler,
sequencer) based on manufacturer’s guidelines.
◦ Record maintenance activities and calibration data.
IX. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Result Documentation
◦ Document sequencing data and analysis results.
◦ Include all necessary information such as patient ID, run
date, control results, and identified mutations.
2. Result Verification
◦ Have a second technologist or qualified personnel review
results for consistency and accuracy.
◦ Verify and validate abnormal findings with additional
confirmatory tests if required.
