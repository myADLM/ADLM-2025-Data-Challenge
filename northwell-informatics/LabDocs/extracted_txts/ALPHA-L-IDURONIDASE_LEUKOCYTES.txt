Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for ALPHA-L-
IDURONIDASE, LEUKOCYTES
1. PURPOSE
This SOP describes the standardized procedure for the analytical
phase of generating results for Alpha-L-Iduronidase activity in
leukocytes in a CLIA-certified laboratory.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel who are trained
and authorized to perform the Alpha-L-Iduronidase activity assay in
leukocyte preparations.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Designated laboratory technologists are responsible for
performing the assay according to this SOP.
• The supervising laboratory scientist ensures all personnel are
trained and competent.
• All staff must identify and report deficiencies or deviations from
this SOP to a supervisor.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Centrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Incubator with temperature control (37°C)
• Fluorometer or suitable detection instrumentation
• Micropipettes and pipette tips
• Hemocytometer or automated cell counter
• Lysis buffer
• Substrate buffer (4-Methylumbelliferyl-alpha-iduronide)
• Stop buffer (e.g., glycine buffer, pH 10.4)
• Leukocyte preparation kits or reagents
5. PROCEDURE
5.1 Specimen Preparation
1. Specimen Requirements:
◦ 5 mL whole blood collected in EDTA tubes.
◦ Specimens must be processed within 24 hours of collection.
Store at 2-8°C if not processed immediately.
2. Leukocyte Isolation:
◦ Separate leukocytes using density gradient centrifugation or
other suitable methods as per manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Wash isolated leukocytes twice with phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS).
◦ Resuspend the cell pellet in 1 mL of lysis buffer.
5.2 Enzyme Assay
1. Lysate Preparation:
◦ Vortex the leukocyte suspension to ensure thorough mixing.
◦ Incubate the suspension on ice for 30 minutes while
vortexing intermittently.
◦ Centrifuge the lysate at 4°C, 12,000 x g for 10 minutes to
remove cell debris.
◦ Transfer the supernatant to a clean microfuge tube; use
immediately or store at -80°C.
2. Reaction Setup:
◦ Prepare the reaction mixture: 10 μL of leukocyte lysate + 90
μL of substrate buffer in each well of a 96-well microplate.
◦ Include blank (buffer only) and control (known enzyme
activity) wells.
3. Incubation:
◦ Incubate the microplate at 37°C for 60 minutes.
◦ Following incubation, add 100 μL of stop buffer to each well
to terminate the reaction.
4. Fluorescence Measurement:
◦ Measure the fluorescence of each well with a fluorometer
set at excitation 365 nm and emission 450 nm.
5. Calculations:
◦ Calculate enzyme activity using the fluorescence intensity of
the samples compared to the control.
◦ Report enzyme activity as nmol of 4-Methylumbelliferone (4-
MU) released per hour per milligram of protein.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run quality control samples alongside patient specimens in each
assay to validate results.
• Calibrate the fluorometer monthly or as required.
• Record reagent lot numbers and expiration dates.
• Perform and document routine maintenance of equipment.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
• Enter and review all test results in the laboratory information
system (LIS).
• Compare patient results to established reference ranges.
• Flag and confirm critical or out-of-range results with a repeat
analysis.
• Generate a final report, including enzyme activity levels and an
interpretive comment if needed.
8. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Reference intervals are derived from healthy control populations
and provided in assay-specific documentation.
• For Alpha-L-Iduronidase activity: 20-50 nmol/h/mg protein (real
values should be verified per laboratory database).
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Ensure proper handling and preparation of leukocytes to avoid
hemolysis and contamination which can affect enzyme activity.
• Follow manufacturer and control sample guidelines for the
substrate and stop solutions to maintain assay integrity.
