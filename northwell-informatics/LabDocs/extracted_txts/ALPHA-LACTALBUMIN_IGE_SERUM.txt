Standard Operating Procedure for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Alpha-Lactalbumin IgE, Serum
1. PURPOSE
To outline the analytical procedures for generating results for Alpha-
Lactalbumin IgE in serum specimens. This SOP ensures accuracy,
reliability, and consistency in laboratory testing for this specific
immunoglobulin E present in serum, which is important for
diagnosing and monitoring allergic conditions.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing and
documenting the analytical procedures according to this SOP,
including any necessary corrective actions.
Laboratory supervisors are responsible for ensuring adherence to
this SOP and for addressing any flagged issues during the analytical
phase.
1. DEFINITION
Alpha-Lactalbumin IgE refers to serum immunoglobulin E antibodies
specific to the alpha-lactalbumin protein found in milk, which may
indicate milk allergies.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Acceptable Specimen:
• Serum collected via venipuncture.
• Preferred volume: 1-2 mL serum.
• Specimen must be centrifuged and the serum separated within 2
hours of collection.
• Specimens should be stored at 2-8°C and tested within 72 hours.
For longer storage, freeze at -20°C or lower.
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Specimen collected in an incorrect tube (e.g., containing additives
other than plain serum separator tubes).
• Specimens with significant hemolysis or lipemia.
• Specimens not stored as outlined above.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• ELISA or ImmunoCAP system for detecting Alpha-Lactalbumin
IgE.
• Serum separator tubes.
• Pipettes and tips.
• Reagents and consumables specific to the chosen analytical
system (e.g., Alpha-Lactalbumin-specific IgE assay kit).
• Controls and calibrators.
Storage of Reagents:
• Follow manufacturer guidelines for storage conditions.
• Check expiration date before use, discard expired reagents.
1. PROCEDURE
Preparation of Equipment:
• Warm-up the ELISA reader or ImmunoCAP system as per
manufacturer’s instructions.
• Ensure that all reagents and controls are at the correct
temperature before beginning the assay.
Sample Preparation:
1. Centrifuge blood samples at 2500-3000 RPM for 10 minutes.
2. Transfer serum to appropriately labeled aliquot tubes.
3. Store serum as per requirements until ready to perform the
assay.
Assay Procedure:
1. Use the ELISA or ImmunoCAP system following the
manufacturer’s instructions for the assay kit.
2. Add controls, calibrators, and patient specimens in specified
wells/positions.
3. Perform washes according to assay protocol.
4. Add substrate/antigen, incubate as required.
5. Measure optical density or fluorescence intensity using the
analytical equipment.
6. Verify that control values are within acceptable ranges.
Quality Control:
• Run at least two levels of quality control samples (negative and
positive) with each batch of patient specimens.
• Evaluate control results to confirm the validity of the assay run.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
Results should be reviewed and verified by the technologist before
transmitting to the LIS. Interpret the results based on manufacturer’s
guidelines and reference ranges provided in the assay kit insert.
Reference Intervals:
• Refer to kit-specific insert for reference intervals for Alpha-
Lactalbumin IgE levels.
Critical Values:
• Immediate reporting to clinician if values indicate a high risk for
severe allergic reactions.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the assay kit insert for specific limitations. Potential
interferences should be noted, such as cross-reactivity with other IgE
antibodies or the presence of rheumatoid factor.

significance.
Document Review and Approval:
• This SOP shall be reviewed annually or when there is a change in
methodology or reagent specifications.
By following this protocol, laboratory personnel will consistently
achieve reliable and accurate test results for Alpha-Lactalbumin IgE
in serum specimens, aiding in the effective diagnosis and
management of milk allergies.
