STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE
Analytical Phase: Generating Results for ALPHA-
MANNOSIDASE in LEUKOCYTES
1. PURPOSE
To provide clear and concise procedures for the analysis and
generating results for Alpha-Mannosidase activity in leukocytes
(white blood cells).
2. SCOPE
This SOP is applicable to all laboratory personnel performing the
Alpha-Mannosidase assay on leukocyte specimens.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all laboratory personnel to adhere to this
protocol and ensure the accuracy and reliability of test results. The
supervisor must oversee the compliance with the SOP and validate
the results.
4. SPECIMEN
Sample Requirements:
• Fresh blood collected in an EDTA tube.
• Volume: Minimum 5 mL.
• Storage: Keep specimens at 2-8°C prior to analysis. Specimens
must be processed within 24 hours of collection.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens older than 24 hours.
• Specimens with hemolysis.
• Specimens not stored correctly or with visible contamination.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Centrifuge capable of reaching 1,500 x g.
• Incubator set at 37°C.
• Spectrophotometer.
• Vortex mixer.
Reagents and Supplies:
• Alpha-Mannosidase assay kit.
• Buffer solutions.
• Enzyme substrate solution.
• EDTA tubes.
• Pipettes and pipette tips.
• Test tubes and microcentrifuge tubes.
6. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation of Leukocyte Lysate:
1. Centrifuge the EDTA blood sample at 1,500 x g for 10 minutes
to remove plasma and collect the buffy coat.
2. Transfer the buffy coat containing leukocytes to a clean
microcentrifuge tube.
3. Wash leukocytes twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS) by centrifuging at 500 x g for 5 minutes.
4. Lyse leukocytes in lysis buffer provided in the assay kit.
Incubate at 37°C for 1 hour with periodic vortexing.
B. Alpha-Mannosidase Assay:
1. Prepare assay mixture as per the kit instructions, including
enzyme substrate solution and buffer.
2. Add leukocyte lysate to the assay mixture in a test tube.
3. Incubate the reaction mixture at 37°C for 30 minutes.
4. Stop the reaction as per the kit instructions using the provided
stopping solution.
5. Measure absorbance using a spectrophotometer at the
wavelength specified by the assay kit (typically around 405 nm).
C. Calculations and Analysis:
1. Calculate enzyme activity using the formula provided in the
assay kit instructions, which typically involves comparison to a
standard curve.
2. Ensure that results fall within the expected range for Alpha-
Mannosidase activity in leukocytes.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
Controls:
• Include both positive and negative controls with each batch of
assays to ensure reliability and accuracy.
• Verify that control results fall within the acceptable range specified
by the kit manufacturer.
Validation:
• Perform duplicate testing for a subset of samples to ensure
reproducibility.
• Document all control results and any deviations.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Results must be reviewed and verified by a trained technologist
before release.
• Report any abnormal or out-of-range results immediately to the
supervising pathologist for further review.
9. REFERENCES
Refer to the Alpha-Mannosidase assay kit manufacturer’s insert and
instructions for detailed information on reagent preparation, assay
technique, and troubleshooting.
10. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the assay kit insert for limitations related to sample
interference, reagent stability, and other specific parameters affecting
the Alpha-Mannosidase assay.
11. SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS
• Follow all laboratory safety procedures, including wearing
personal protective equipment (PPE) and handling blood
specimens with care to avoid exposure.
• Dispose of all biological waste according to biohazard protocols.
12. TROUBLESHOOTING
In case of technical difficulties or discrepancies in the results, consult
the assay kit instructions and perform repeat tests if necessary. Notify
the supervisor for persistent issues.
