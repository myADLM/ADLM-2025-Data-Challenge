ALPHA-SUBUNIT PITUITARY TUMOR MARKER, SERUM SOP
1. PURPOSE
To provide a detailed and standardized protocol for performing the
analytical phase of generating results for Alpha-Subunit Pituitary
Tumor Marker, Serum.
Responsibility: Laboratory personnel trained in the specific methods
and procedures for analysis of Alpha-Subunit Pituitary Tumor Marker
will be responsible for carrying out the steps outlined in this SOP. It is
crucial for all staff to ensure that every analysis meets the policy
standards and to report any inconsistencies to the laboratory
supervisor immediately.
1. PRINCIPLE
The Alpha-Subunit Pituitary Tumor Marker test is used to monitor
pituitary tumors by detecting the alpha-subunit of glycoprotein
hormones in serum. The test is typically performed using an enzyme-
linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/Acceptable:
• Serum: Collect blood using a serum separator tube (SST). Allow
the blood to clot at room temperature for 30 minutes and
centrifuge within 2 hours of collection. Transfer serum to a plastic
transport vial for testing.
Unacceptable:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric specimens.
• Specimens stored at room temperature for more than 6 hours.
• Insufficient volume for testing (minimum volume required: 1 mL of
serum).
Specimen Stability:
• Room temperature: ≤6 hours
• Refrigerated (2-8°C): ≤5 days
• Frozen (-20°C or below): ≤3 months

• Centrifuge
• Pipettes and tips
• Vortex mixer
Reagents:
• Alpha-Subunit Pituitary Tumor Marker ELISA Kit
• Calibrators and Controls (low, medium, and high)
• Wash buffer

1. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Bring all reagents and samples to room temperature before
beginning the assay.
2. Thoroughly mix all reagents and samples by gentle inversion or
vortexing.
Assay Procedure:
1. Sample Addition:
◦ Prepare standards, controls, and samples.
◦ Pipette 50 µL of standards, controls, and patient serum
samples into duplicate wells of the microtiter plate.
2. Incubation:
◦ Add 50 µL of enzyme conjugate to each well.
◦ Gently tap the plate to mix contents.
◦ Cover the plate and incubate at room temperature for 60
minutes.
3. Washing:
◦ Wash each well five times with the wash buffer.
◦ After the final wash, invert the plate and tap on absorbent
paper to remove excess liquid.
4. Substrate Reaction:
◦ Add 100 µL of the substrate solution to each well.
◦ Incubate the plate at room temperature in the dark for 30
minutes.
5. Stopping Reaction:
◦ Add 50 µL of the stop solution to each well.
◦ Gently tap the plate to ensure thorough mixing.
6. Reading:
◦ Read the absorbance of each well at 450 nm using an
ELISA plate reader within 30 minutes after adding the stop
solution.
7. CALCULATING RESULTS
8. Calibration Curve:
◦ Plot the absorbance for each standard on the y-axis against
the concentration on the x-axis to create a standard curve.
◦ Construct the calibration curve using a best-fit curve (linear
or logistic regression).
9. Calculating Sample Concentrations:
◦ Determine the concentration of the Alpha-Subunit Pituitary
Tumor Marker in each sample by interpolating the
absorbance from the calibration curve.
10. Quality Control:
◦ Ensure all controls fall within the predefined ranges. Repeat
the assay if controls are out of range.
11. QUALITY CONTROL
Material:
• Low, medium, high controls (included in ELISA kit).
Storage:
• 2-8°C until expiry date.
Procedure:
• Run controls with each batch of patient specimens. Record
results of controls following site-specific guidelines. Use control
results to verify accuracy and precision of the test.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
2. Result Verification:
◦ Review and verify the concentrations calculated from the
standard curve.
◦ Ensure all controls are within established limits before
reporting patient results.
◦ Follow site-specific guidelines for result entry into the
Laboratory Information System (LIS).
3. Reference Intervals:
◦ Negative: <0.25 ng/mL
◦ Borderline: 0.25 - 0.35 ng/mL
◦ Positive: >0.35 ng/mL
4. Critical Values:
◦ Report values exceeding 3.5 ng/mL as critical. Follow the
laboratory’s protocol for immediate notification of critical
results.
5. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to the ELISA Kit insert for potential limitations and
interferences impacting the Alpha-Subunit Pituitary Tumor Marker
assay.
