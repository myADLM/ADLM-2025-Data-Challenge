Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Detection of
Alpha-Synuclein Protein Aggregates in Spinal Fluid
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedure for analyzing
spinal fluid samples to detect alpha-synuclein protein aggregates
using laboratory techniques compliant with CLIA-certified laboratory
standards.
Responsibility:
• It is the responsibility of designated laboratory staff to perform the
analysis and document the results.
• Supervisors must ensure proper training for staff, monitor
adherence to the SOP, and address any issues or non-
conformities.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to the analysis of spinal fluid samples
received from patients for the detection of alpha-synuclein protein
aggregates.
3. DEFINITIONS
• Alpha-Synuclein Protein Aggregates: Misfolded protein
structures associated with neurodegenerative disorders such as
Parkinson's disease.
• Spinal Fluid (Cerebrospinal Fluid, CSF): A clear, colorless body
fluid found in the brain and spine.
4. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
Equipment:
• Centrifuge
• Micropipettes with appropriate tips
• Refrigerated storage unit set to 2-8°C
• Plate reader or fluorescence microscope (depending on assay
type)
• Vortex mixer
Reagents:
• Alpha-synuclein specific assay kit (e.g., ELISA or RT-QuIC)
• Positive and negative control samples
• Washing buffers and other reagents as specified in assay kit
instructions
• Sample tubes and reagents for CSF collection if necessary
5. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Handling and Preparation:
1. Specimen Requirements:
◦ Preferred: 1-2 mL of freshly collected CSF, transported to
the laboratory within 1-2 hours of collection.
◦ CSF should be stored at 2-8°C if analysis cannot be
immediately performed but must be processed within 24
hours of collection.
◦ Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
2. Unacceptable Specimens:
◦ CSF samples that are hemolyzed, clotted or contaminated.
◦ Specimens without proper identification or collection date/
time.
B. Assay Procedure:
1. Preparation:
◦ Allow reagents and samples to equilibrate to room
temperature.
◦ Prepare assay workspace with all necessary equipment and
reagents.
2. Aliquoting:
◦ Vortex the CSF samples gently to ensure homogeneity.
◦ Aliquot 100 μL of CSF into each designated well of the
assay plate.
3. Assay Setup:
◦ Follow manufacturer’s instructions specific to the assay kit
for adding reagents, incubation times, and temperature
settings.
◦ Include appropriate controls (positive and negative) to
ensure assay validity.
4. Measurement:
◦ After the assay incubation is complete, measure the
fluorescence or absorbance as specified in the assay
protocol using the plate reader or fluorescence microscope.
◦ Document raw data for all samples and controls.
5. Controls:
◦ Validate the results by comparing sample readings to the
positive and negative controls.
◦ In the event of control failure, repeat the assay or notify the
supervisor for further instructions.
C. Result Analysis:
1. Data Analysis:
◦ Process the raw data according to the manufacturer’s assay
kit instructions.
◦ Compare the alpha-synuclein signal in patient samples to
threshold values set by the kit.
2. Quality Control:
◦ Internal quality control samples must be included in each
assay run.
◦ Review quality control logs to ensure that all quality control
criteria are met.
3. Result Reporting:
◦ Enter results into the laboratory information system (LIS).
◦ Mark assay results as “Confirmed Positive” or “Negative”
based on the threshold values and control validation.
◦ All results must be reviewed and verified by a licensed
technologist or supervisory staff before release.
6. TROUBLESHOOTING
1. Inconsistent Results:
◦ Re-examine the sample preparation steps, reagent integrity,
and assay conditions.
◦ Review equipment calibration and maintenance logs.
◦ Repeat the assay if needed.
2. Instrument Errors:
◦ Perform troubleshooting steps as indicated by instrument
manuals.
◦ Contact technical support if issues persist.
7. DOCUMENTATION
• Ensure all testing and quality control results are properly
documented in laboratory records.
• Maintain logs for specimen reception, processing, and assay
performance.
• Record any deviations from standard procedure and corrective
actions taken.
