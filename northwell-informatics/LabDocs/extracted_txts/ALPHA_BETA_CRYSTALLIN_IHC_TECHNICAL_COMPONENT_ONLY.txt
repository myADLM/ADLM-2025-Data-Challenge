Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase of Generating Results for ALPHA/BETA
CRYSTALLIN IHC, Technical Component Only
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the standardized procedure for
performing the immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining and analysis for
ALPHA/BETA CRYSTALLIN in various tissue samples, ensuring
consistency, accuracy, and reproducibility in the laboratory's technical
component.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
Technologists performing the staining procedure are responsible for
adhering to this protocol. Supervisors are responsible for ensuring
compliance, troubleshooting issues, and maintaining quality control.
3. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all tissue samples that are to be stained
and analyzed for ALPHA/BETA CRYSTALLIN using IHC techniques
in the laboratory.
4. DEFINITIONS
• IHC: Immunohistochemistry, a method for detecting specific
antigens in tissue sections using antibodies.
• ALPHA/BETA CRYSTALLIN: a protein used as a marker in
various diseases.
• Technical Component Only: This protocol covers only the
technical aspect of generating results, excluding diagnostic
interpretation.
5. EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS
• Automated IHC stainer (e.g., Ventana BenchMark XT, Leica Bond
Max, or similar)
• Microscope slides with tissue sections
• Antigen retrieval solution
• Primary antibody against ALPHA/BETA CRYSTALLIN
• Secondary antibody (HRP-conjugated)
• Detection system (e.g., DAB chromogen)
• Counterstain (e.g., Hematoxylin)
• Mounting medium
• Coverslips
• Positive and negative control tissues
• Quality control materials
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
• Logbook for recording batches, reagents, and controls
6. ENVIRONMENT
Ensure the work area is clean, organized, and free from
contamination. The room temperature should be controlled at
20-26°C, and the humidity should be maintained between 15-85%.
7. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation of Tissue Sections:
1. Ensure tissue sections are properly fixed and embedded in
paraffin.
2. Cut sections at 4-5 μm thickness and mount onto charged
slides.
3. Bake slides at 60°C for at least 1 hour to ensure adherence of
sections to slides.
B. Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
1. Deparaffinize slides in xylene for 10 minutes (2 changes).
2. Rehydrate slides through graded alcohols (100%, 95%, 70%)
for 5 minutes each.
3. Rinse slides in running tap water for 5 minutes.
C. Antigen Retrieval:
1. Perform heat-induced epitope retrieval (HIER) using
appropriate antigen retrieval buffer (e.g., citrate buffer, pH 6.0 or
EDTA, pH 8.0) in a pressure cooker, microwave, or water bath
as per manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Allow slides to cool for 20 minutes at room temperature.
3. Rinse slides in running tap water and then in phosphate-
buffered saline (PBS).
D. Blocking Endogenous Peroxidase:
1. Incubate slides in 3% hydrogen peroxide in methanol for 10
minutes to block endogenous peroxidase activity.
2. Rinse slides in PBS twice for 2 minutes each.
E. Primary Antibody Incubation:
1. Incubate slides with primary antibody against ALPHA/BETA
CRYSTALLIN, diluted as per the manufacturer’s instructions, in
a humidified chamber for 1 hour at room temperature.
2. Rinse slides in PBS twice for 2 minutes each.
F. Secondary Antibody Incubation:
1. Incubate slides with HRP-conjugated secondary antibody for 30
minutes at room temperature.
2. Rinse slides in PBS twice for 2 minutes each.
G. Detection:
1. Incubate slides with DAB chromogen solution until the desired
stain intensity is achieved (usually 1-10 minutes).
2. Rinse slides in running tap water to stop the reaction.
H. Counterstaining:
1. Counterstain slides with Hematoxylin for 1 minute.
2. Rinse slides in running tap water and differentiate in acid
alcohol if necessary.
3. Blue the slides in running tap water for 2-3 minutes.
I. Dehydration and Mounting:
1. Dehydrate slides through graded alcohols (70%, 95%, 100%)
and clear in xylene.
2. Mount coverslips using a permanent mounting medium.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include positive and negative control slides with each batch of
staining.
• Ensure lot numbers of reagents and antibodies are recorded.
• Document any deviations from the protocol and corrective actions
taken.
• Regularly review staining results for consistency and accuracy.
9. INTERPRETATION AND REPORTING
Technical staff should generate results based on the staining pattern
and intensity observed under the microscope. Ensure all results are
recorded accurately, and the slides are labelled properly.
10. TROUBLESHOOTING
• Weak or No Staining: Check antibody concentration, expiration
dates of reagents, and optimize antigen retrieval protocol.
• Non-Specific Staining: Ensure thorough washing steps and
consider using blocking solutions.
• High Background: Optimize blocking and washing steps, check
for contamination.
11. DOCUMENTATION
All steps performed, including reagent lot numbers, incubation times,
and any deviations from the protocol, should be documented in the
logbook.
12. SAFETY
• Adhere to all laboratory safety protocols.
• Use PPE such as gloves, lab coat, and safety glasses.
• Handle chemicals and reagents according to their safety data
sheet (SDS) guidelines.
13. REVIEW AND REVISION
This SOP should be reviewed annually, or whenever changes in
methodology or instrumentation occur. Revisions should be
documented and communicated to all relevant laboratory staff.
