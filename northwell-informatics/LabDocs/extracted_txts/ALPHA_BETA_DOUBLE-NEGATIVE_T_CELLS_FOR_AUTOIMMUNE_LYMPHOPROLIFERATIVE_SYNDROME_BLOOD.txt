Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Analytical Phase
for Generating Results for Alpha Beta Double-Negative
T Cells for Autoimmune Lymphoproliferative
Syndrome, Blood
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the analytical procedures for detecting and
quantifying Alpha Beta Double-Negative (DN) T cells in blood
samples to diagnose Autoimmune Lymphoproliferative Syndrome
(ALPS).
Responsibility:
• Designated staff are responsible for carrying out the analysis,
documenting procedures, interpreting results, and notifying the
supervising pathologist of any abnormalities.
• Supervisors must ensure that all staff are trained and comply with
this SOP.
1. DEFINITION
• Alpha Beta DN T cells: T cells that lack both CD4 and CD8
surface markers but express T-cell receptor alpha beta.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Peripheral blood
• Volume: 3-5 mL in EDTA-anticoagulated tube
• Stability: Process sample within 24 hours of collection; if delay,
store at 2-8°C but must be processed within 48 hours.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Flow Cytometer (equipped with at least three lasers and eight
colors)
• EDTA tubes
• Centrifuge
• PBS (Phosphate Buffered Saline)
• Fluorochrome-conjugated monoclonal antibodies:
◦ Anti-CD3 (e.g., FITC)
◦ Anti-CD4 (e.g., PE)
◦ Anti-CD8 (e.g., PerCP)
◦ Anti-TCR alpha beta (e.g., APC)
◦ Anti-CD45RA (e.g., PE-Cy7)
◦ Anti-CD27 (e.g., BV421)
◦ Anti-CD57 (e.g., APC-H7)
• BD FACS Lysing Solution
• Appropriate controls (isotype controls and positive/negative gating
controls)
1. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation:
1. Label corresponding number of flow cytometry tubes.
2. Prepare working solutions of antibodies according to the
manufacturer’s recommendations (typically 1:10 dilution in
PBS).
3. Add 100 µL of well-mixed blood sample to each tube.
4. Add appropriate volume of each antibody cocktail to the blood
sample, according to panel design for DN T cell identification.
B. Staining:
1. Vortex the tubes gently to mix.
2. Incubate the tubes at room temperature in the dark for 15-30
minutes.
3. Add 2 mL of BD FACS Lysing Solution to each tube to lyse red
blood cells.
4. Vortex gently and incubate for 10 minutes at room temperature
in the dark.
5. Centrifuge tubes at 500 x g for 5 minutes.
6. Carefully decant the supernatant.
7. Wash cells by adding 2 mL of PBS, vortex, and centrifuge as
above. Repeat once.
8. Resuspend pellet in 300-500 µL of PBS for acquisition on flow
cytometer.
C. Data Acquisition and Analysis:
1. Set up the flow cytometer and calibrate using standard beads
according to manufacturer instructions.
2. Acquire at least 100,000 lymphocyte events per tube.
3. Use appropriate compensation controls to correct spectral
overlap.
4. Gate on lymphocytes using forward and side scatter in total
events.
5. Apply gating strategy to identify DN T cell populations,
specifically:
◦ Gate on CD3+TCRαβ+ cells.
◦ Gate out CD4+ and CD8+ cells to isolate
CD3+TCRαβ+CD4-CD8- (double-negative) cells.
D. Data Interpretation:
1. Calculate the percentage of DN T cells within the lymphocyte
population.
2. Generate histograms and dot plots to display gating strategy
and results.
3. Compare results to established reference ranges for ALPS
diagnosis.
4. Document any abnormal findings and provide interpretation.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform daily instrument quality control (QC) checks as per flow
cytometer manufacturer guidelines.
• Include isotype control and positive/negative controls in each run
to ensure specificity and sensitivity of staining.
• Use standard deviation and coefficient of variation (CV) for QC
material to monitor assay precision.
• Conduct periodic proficiency testing with reference samples to
ensure accuracy.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results should be reviewed and validated by a qualified
technologist before releasing.
• Interpretative comments must include:
◦ Percentage of DN T cells among total lymphocytes.
◦ Comparison to reference ranges for ALPS.
◦ Any noteworthy observations or recommendations for follow-
up.

1. REVISIONS AND DOCUMENT CONTROL
• Bi-annual review of this SOP to ensure compliance with new
regulations and scientific advancements.
• Document any modifications and notify all laboratory staff of
changes.
This SOP has been reviewed and approved by the laboratory's
Supervising Pathologist and Quality Assurance Manager as of
October 2023.
