Title: Standard Operating Procedure for the Analytical Phase of
ALPHA DEFENSIN, Lateral Flow Assay, Synovial Fluid
1. Purpose
The purpose of this SOP is to describe the procedure for performing
the Alpha Defensin Lateral Flow Assay on synovial fluid samples to
diagnose periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) accurately and efficiently.
Responsibility:
• It is the responsibility of all laboratory personnel performing this
assay to adhere to the procedures stated in this SOP to ensure
accurate and reliable test results.
• It is the responsibility of the laboratory supervisor to ensure all
personnel are adequately trained and the equipment is
maintained as per guidelines.
1. Definitions
Alpha Defensin: A peptide released by neutrophils in response to
microbial invasion. Its presence in synovial fluid is a biomarker for
infection.
Lateral Flow Assay: A point-of-care diagnostic device used to detect
the presence of Alpha Defensin in synovial fluid.
Synovial Fluid: Fluid found in the cavities of synovial joints, collected
for testing.
1. Procedure
Specimen Requirements and Stability:
• Collect synovial fluid in a sterile syringe directly from the joint.
• The recommended volume is 0.5 to 1.0 mL of synovial fluid.
• Store the collected sample at 2-8°C if testing is delayed; samples
are stable at this temperature for up to 24 hours.
• Do not freeze the sample.
Materials and Reagents:
• Alpha Defensin Lateral Flow Assay kit
• Synovial fluid sample
• Timer
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
Preparation Steps:
• Ensure all reagents and the assay device are at room
temperature before beginning the test.
• Wear PPE (lab coat, gloves, and safety glasses) to avoid
contamination and exposure to biological fluids.
• Label the test device appropriately with the patient's information.
Test Procedure:
1. Remove the lateral flow assay device from its packaging.
2. Add the required amount (as per manufacturer instructions) of
synovial fluid directly onto the sample application area of the
test device using the provided pipette.
3. Start the timer immediately once the sample is applied.
4. Allow the sample to flow through the device for the duration
specified by the manufacturer (usually 10-20 minutes).
5. Read the results at the specified time frame by comparing the
test line and control line against the provided reference card.
◦ A visible test line along with a control line indicates a
positive result for Alpha Defensin.
◦ Only the control line visible indicates a negative result.
◦ Absence of the control line indicates an invalid test and
requires a repeat assay.
Quality Control:
• Run quality control materials provided with the assay kit before
patient testing.
• Ensure control results meet specified criteria before interpreting
patient results.
• Document all quality control results in the laboratory quality
control log.
Reporting Results:
• Document the test results in the laboratory information system
(LIS).
• For positive results, document as "Alpha Defensin detected –
Positive for PJI."
• For negative results, document as "Alpha Defensin not detected –
Negative for PJI."
• For invalid results, document as "Invalid test – Repeat Assay
Required."
1. Method Limitations Refer to the Alpha Defensin Lateral Flow
Assay kit insert for detailed limitations of the assay.
2. Troubleshooting
• In case of invalid results, repeat the assay with a new test device
and a new sample aliquot.
• If repeated invalid results are obtained, consult the laboratory
supervisor and refer to the manufacturer's troubleshooting guide.
1. Safety and Waste Management
• Dispose of all used assay components, pipettes, and patient
samples in biohazard waste containers.
• Clean work surfaces with appropriate disinfectants before and
after completing the assay.
