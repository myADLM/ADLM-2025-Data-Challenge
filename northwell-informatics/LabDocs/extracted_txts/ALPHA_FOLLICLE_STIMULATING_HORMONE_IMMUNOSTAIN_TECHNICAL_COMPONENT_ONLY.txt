Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Alpha Follicle Stimulating
Hormone Immunostain, Technical Component Only
1. PURPOSE: The purpose of this SOP is to outline the analytical
procedures for performing Alpha Follicle Stimulating Hormone
(α-FSH) Immunostaining on histological specimens. This
procedure focuses on the technical component only, involving
specimen preparation, staining, and quality control processes.
This SOP ensures that slides are prepared consistently and
meet quality standards for subsequent interpretative analysis by
a pathologist.
2. RESPONSIBILITY:
◦ It is the responsibility of the laboratory technologist or
histotechnician to perform the immunohistochemistry
staining according to this SOP.
◦ It is the responsibility of the laboratory supervisor to oversee
compliance and monitor quality control activities.
3. SPECIMEN:
◦ Preferred: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue
sections.
◦ Acceptable: Tissue sections fixed with other accepted
fixatives as per laboratory acceptance criteria.
◦ Unacceptable: Specimens with incomplete or improper
fixation, and specimens showing significant degradation or
autolysis.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES:
◦ Automated immunostainer or manual staining setup.
◦ Positive control slides with known α-FSH positivity.
◦ Primary antibody against α-FSH.
◦ Secondary antibodies and detection reagents (e.g., HRP-
conjugated secondary).
◦ Counterstain (e.g., hematoxylin).
◦ Mounting media.
◦ Slides, cover slips, forceps, and necessary consumables.
5. PROCEDURE:
A. Slide Preparation
1. Section FFPE tissue blocks at 3-4 microns thickness and
place on positively charged slides.
2. Bake slides at 60°C for a minimum of 1 hour to ensure
adhesion of tissue sections to the slides.
B. Deparaffinization and Rehydration
1. Deparaffinize slides in three changes of xylene, 5 minutes
each.
2. Rehydrate through a series of graded alcohols (100%,
95%, 80%, and 70%) for 5 minutes each.
3. Rinse slides in running distilled water for 5 minutes.
C. Antigen Retrieval
1. Perform antigen retrieval using a pressure cooker or
microwave in an appropriate antigen retrieval buffer (e.g.,
citrate buffer or EDTA) for a specified duration (about 20
minutes).
2. Allow the slides to cool down to room temperature in the
retrieval buffer.
3. Rinse slides in running distilled water followed by Tris-
buffered saline (TBS) or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)
for 5 minutes.
D. Blocking and Primary Antibody Application
1. Apply a blocking solution (e.g., serum or blocking reagent)
to the sections to prevent non-specific binding.
2. Incubate slides in a humidified chamber for 10 minutes.
3. Drain blocking solution and apply primary antibody
against α-FSH diluted in appropriate diluent per
manufacturer’s instructions.
4. Incubate in a humidified chamber for 1 hour at room
temperature or overnight at 4°C.
E. Detection of Primary Antibody
1. Rinse slides 3 times with TBS or PBS, 5 minutes each.
2. Apply secondary antibody (e.g., HRP-conjugated) per
manufacturer’s instructions and incubate for 30 minutes at
room temperature in a humidified chamber.
3. Rinse slides 3 times with TBS or PBS, 5 minutes each.
F. Visualization and Counterstaining
1. Apply chromogenic substrate (e.g., DAB) until the desired
color intensity is achieved (approximately 5-10 minutes).
2. Rinse slides in distilled water.
3. Counterstain with hematoxylin for 2 minutes.
4. Rinse in running tap water to blue the hematoxylin.
G. Dehydration and Mounting
1. Dehydrate through graded alcohols (70%, 80%, 95%, and
100%) for 5 minutes each.
2. Clear in 3 changes of xylene, 5 minutes each.
3. Mount coverslip using a suitable mounting medium.
6. QUALITY CONTROL:
◦ Include positive control slides with each staining run to
validate staining reagents and protocols.
◦ Document lot numbers and expiration dates of all reagents
used.
◦ Monitor staining intensity and specificity by reviewing
positive control slides.
◦ Any deviations or inconsistent staining results must be
documented and investigated.
7. REPORTING RESULTS:
◦ The stained slides are to be reviewed by a pathologist, who
will provide the interpretative report.
◦ The technical component involves recording the staining
protocol used, including reagent lot numbers and any
deviations from the SOP.
8. REFERENCE INTERVALS:
◦ Not applicable for the technical component only.
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
◦ Inadequate antigen retrieval may result in weak or absent
staining.
◦ Non-specific staining may occur if blocking steps are not
adequately performed or if there is cross-reactivity.
◦ Always follow manufacturer-specific instructions and consult
technical support as needed.

◦ Manufacturer’s instruction for the primary antibody.
◦ Laboratory guidelines and protocols for
immunohistochemistry staining.
