Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Alpha Globin Cluster Locus Deletion/Duplication Analysis
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the procedures for the analytical phase of
detecting deletions and duplications within the alpha globin gene
cluster (HBA1 and HBA2) using multiplex ligation-dependent probe
amplification (MLPA) in peripheral blood samples. Detailed herein are
steps for MLPA assay execution, data interpretation, and reporting of
results.
2. SCOPE
This protocol applies to all laboratory personnel trained and
authorized to perform MLPA assays for the detection of deletions and
duplications within the alpha globin gene cluster in blood specimens
received in the laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
Laboratory technologists and scientists are responsible for adhering
to this protocol, carrying out the assay, analyzing the results, and
reporting findings. Supervisors are responsible for ensuring
compliance and for the review and validation of results.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Peripheral blood
• Collection Tubes: EDTA tubes
• Volume: Minimum 3 mL of blood
• Specimen Storage: Store at 2-8°C if processing is delayed, and
process within 7 days of collection.
5. EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS
• MLPA kit specific for alpha globin gene cluster (e.g., P140 HBA
kit)
• Thermal cycler
• Capillary electrophoresis system (e.g., ABI PRISM Genetic
Analyzer)
• PCR reagents and consumables (e.g., Pipettes, Tips, Microfuge
tubes)
• Bioanalyzer or equivalent system for DNA quantification
• Analytical software for MLPA data analysis (e.g., Coffalyser.NET)
6. REAGENT PREPARATION AND STORAGE
• All reagents and kits must be stored as per manufacturer’s
instructions.
• Before use, ensure reagents are brought to room temperature
and mixed thoroughly.
7. PROCEDURE
A. DNA Extraction
1. Extract genomic DNA from 200 µL of peripheral blood using a
standard operative kit (e.g., QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit).
2. Quantify the DNA using a spectrophotometer or a fluorometer
to ensure adequate concentration (20–50 ng/µL) and purity
(A260/A280 ratio of 1.8–2.0).
B. MLPA Reaction
1. Hybridization: a. Pipette 5 µL of the denatured DNA (50 ng)
into each reaction tube. b. Add 1.5 µL MLPA probe mix to each
tube, ensuring thorough mixing. c. Denature by incubating at
98°C for 5 minutes on a thermal cycler without lid heating. d.
Hybridize overnight (16 hours) at 60°C.
2. Ligation and Amplification: a. Add 32 µL ligation master mix
(containing buffer and ligase enzyme) to each tube and
incubate at 54°C for 15 minutes. b. Heat-inactivate the ligase at
98°C for 5 minutes. c. Add 10 µL PCR master mix and 4 µL of
each PCR primer mix. d. Perform the PCR amplification using
the following cycling conditions:
◦ Initial denaturation at 95°C for 1 min
◦ 28 cycles of 95°C for 30 sec, 60°C for 30 sec, and 72°C for
1 min
◦ Final extension at 60°C for 20 min
3. Fragment Analysis: a. Prepare the capillary electrophoresis
run by mixing the PCR products with size standards and Hi-Di
formamide. b. Denature the mixture at 95°C for 3 minutes, then
immediately place on ice. c. Run the samples on the ABI
PRISM Genetic Analyzer according to the manufacturer’s
protocol.
C. Data Analysis and Interpretation
1. Upload and analyze the raw data using analytical software
(e.g., Coffalyser.NET).
2. Normalize the peak heights and compare to reference samples
to determine the copy number of each targeted region within
the alpha globin gene cluster.
3. Identify deletions or duplications based on the relative peak
ratios compared to control probes.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include positive and negative controls in each assay run to
validate the performance of the MLPA.
• Perform regular maintenance and calibration of equipment as per
the manufacturer’s recommendations.
• Document all assay details, any deviations, and corrective actions
taken on the assay log sheet.
9. RESULT REPORTING
• Results should be reviewed by a qualified laboratory technologist
and verified by a technical supervisor.
• Report findings in a standardized format, indicating the presence
or absence of deletions/duplications, including specific details
about affected regions of the alpha globin cluster.
• Critical or unexpected results should be communicated promptly
to the requesting healthcare provider.

HBA kit)
