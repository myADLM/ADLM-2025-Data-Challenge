Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analyzing ALPHA
GLOBIN CLUSTER LOCUS DELETION/DUPLICATION
1. PURPOSE
This SOP provides detailed instructions on the analytical phase of
generating results for the ALPHA GLOBIN CLUSTER LOCUS
DELETION/DUPLICATION assay. This includes specimen handling,
DNA extraction, PCR amplification, fragment analysis, data
interpretation, and reporting results.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel involved in performing
and analyzing the ALPHA GLOBIN CLUSTER LOCUS DELETION/
DUPLICATION assay.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Laboratory Technologists: Responsible for performing the assay
as per the protocol.
• Supervisors: Ensure compliance with SOP, review results, and
address any deviations.
4. SPECIMEN HANDLING AND REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: EDTA whole blood, 5-10 mL
• Stability: Specimens should be stored at 2-8°C and processed
within 7 days of collection. For longer storage, specimens should
be frozen at -20°C or lower.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• DNA extraction kit (as per laboratory preference)
• PCR reagents (primers, Taq polymerase, dNTPs, buffer)
• Thermal cycler
• Fragment analyzer (e.g., capillary electrophoresis system)
• Positive and negative controls
• Nuclease-free water
• Pipettes and tips
• Vortex mixer
• Centrifuge
6. PROCEDURE
6.1 DNA Extraction
1. Purpose: To isolate high-quality genomic DNA from whole
blood.
2. Procedure:
◦ Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for the chosen DNA
extraction kit.
◦ Quantify the extracted DNA using a spectrophotometer or
fluorometer. Ensure DNA purity with an A260/A280 ratio of
1.8-2.0.
◦ Store extracted DNA at 2-8°C if to be used within 1 week,
otherwise, store at -20°C or lower.
6.2 PCR Amplification
1. Purpose: To amplify the regions of the ALPHA GLOBIN gene
cluster for deletion/duplication analysis.
2. Procedure:
◦ Prepare the PCR reaction mix as follows; components and
volumes may be adjusted based on the specific reaction
requirements:
▪ DNA template: 50-100 ng
▪ Forward primer: 0.2 µM
▪ Reverse primer: 0.2 µM
▪ dNTP mix: 200 µM each
▪ Taq polymerase and appropriate buffer: as per
manufacturer’s recommendation
▪ Nuclease-free water: to final reaction volume (50 µL)
◦ Set up the PCR program:
▪ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 5 minutes
▪ 35 cycles of:
▪ Denaturation: 95°C for 30 seconds
▪ Annealing: 58-62°C for 30 seconds (optimize based
on primer Tm)
▪ Extension: 72°C for 1 minute
▪ Final extension: 72°C for 5 minutes
◦ Include positive and negative controls in each run.
6.3 Fragment Analysis
1. Purpose: To detect and analyze PCR products for size
determination and to identify deletions/duplications.
2. Procedure:
◦ Load amplified PCR products onto a fragment analyzer.
◦ Follow the instrument’s protocol for running samples and
setting up the capillary electrophoresis.
◦ Analyze data using associated software to determine the
size of PCR fragments.
◦ Compare sizes to expected values for normal, deletion, and
duplication alleles.
6.4 Data Interpretation
1. Purpose: To interpret the results from fragment analysis for
clinical reporting.
2. Procedure:
◦ Review fragment sizes in control and patient samples.
◦ Identify deviations from expected fragment sizes indicative
of deletions/duplications in the ALPHA GLOBIN gene
cluster.
◦ Verify results with internal controls and repeat analysis if
necessary.
◦ Document any discrepancies and troubleshooting steps
taken.
6.5 Reporting Results
1. Purpose: To correctly record and report the findings in the
Laboratory Information System (LIS).
2. Procedure:
◦ Enter results into the LIS after careful review and verification
by a qualified technologist or supervisor.
◦ Ensure that all critical results are reviewed and confirmed.
◦ Generate a final report including:
▪ Patient identification and sample details
▪ Detailed interpretation of the findings
▪ Any limitations of the test and recommendations for
further testing if applicable.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run positive and negative controls with every batch of specimens.
• Include internal quality control material to ensure the accuracy of
the assay.
• Ensure that all equipment is calibrated and maintained according
to manufacturer’s guidelines.
• Document all quality control measures and any corrective actions
taken.
8. SAFETY PRECAUTIONS
• Follow all biosafety guidelines to handle human specimens.
• Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) at all
times.
• Dispose of all biohazard waste following the laboratory’s waste
disposal protocol.
