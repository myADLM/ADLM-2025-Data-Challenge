Standard Operating Procedure for the Analysis of Alpha Globin
Gene Sequencing
1. PURPOSE:
This procedure describes the process to analyze and generate
results for Alpha Globin Gene Sequencing using the laboratory’s
designated sequencing platform. It ensures that sequences are
accurately processed, analyzed, and interpreted to assist in the
diagnosis of conditions related to alpha globin gene mutations.
1. SCOPE:
This SOP applies to the designated laboratory personnel responsible
for handling, processing, and analyzing the sequencing data for
Alpha Globin gene sequencing.
1. RESPONSIBILITY:
It is the responsibility of the trained laboratory personnel to perform
the procedures as outlined, ensure all data is handled accurately, and
perform quality control checks. Supervisors are responsible for
reviewing and validating final results.
1. DEFINITIONS:
Alpha Globin Gene: Genes coding for the alpha chain of hemoglobin.
Sequencing Platform: The laboratory instrument and associated
software used for next-generation sequencing (NGS).
1. PROCEDURE:
5.1. Specimen Requirements:
• Specimen type: EDTA whole blood (3-5 mL) or DNA extracted
from blood.
• DNA concentration: 20-50 ng/μL with 260/280 ratio of 1.7-2.0.
• DNA quantity: Minimum 500 ng total yield.
5.2. Pre-Analysis Setup:
• Verify specimen meets requirements and document any
deviations.
• Label all samples appropriately with unique identifiers.
5.3. Library Preparation:
• Follow established protocol for library preparation specific to the
sequencer.
• Include necessary controls (positive and negative) during library
prep.
• Quantify libraries and normalize concentrations to the
recommended input for the sequencer.
5.4. Sequencing Run:
• Load prepared libraries onto the sequencer according to
manufacturer’s instructions.
• Set up sequencing run parameters specific to the Alpha Globin
gene target regions.
• Monitor run progress, handle any alerts or errors following
troubleshooting guidelines.
5.5. Data Analysis:
• Transfer sequencing data from the sequencer’s output to the
analysis pipeline.
• Utilize bioinformatics tools to align sequences to the reference
genome.
• Implement variant calling algorithms to identify single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs), insertions, and deletions.
5.6. Data Interpretation:
• Review variant calls in the context of known alpha globin
mutations.
• Annotate variants using clinical databases and literature.
• Use established criteria to classify variants as pathogenic, likely
pathogenic, of uncertain significance, likely benign, or benign.
5.7. Quality Control:
• Perform quality control checks at each stage: raw data quality
metrics, alignment quality, variant calling consistency.
• Reanalyze any samples failing QC metrics.
5.8. Result Reporting:
• Document results in the laboratory information system (LIS).
• Generate a comprehensive report correlating clinical significance
of variants.
• Reports must be reviewed and validated by a supervisor or
designated sign-off personnel.
5.9. Documentation and Record-keeping:
• Keep detailed records of all processes, including library
preparation, sequencing run parameters, QC checks, and final
reports.
• Archive sequencing data and analysis reports securely according
to laboratory policies.

1. REVIEW AND REVISION:
This protocol should be reviewed annually or whenever significant
changes to techniques, equipment, or standards occur. Revisions
must be documented, and all personnel must be trained on updated
procedures.
