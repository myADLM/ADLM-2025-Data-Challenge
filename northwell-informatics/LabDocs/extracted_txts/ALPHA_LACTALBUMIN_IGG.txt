STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP) FOR ALPHA-
LACTALBUMIN IgG ASSAY
1. PURPOSE To ensure the accurate and precise measurement of
Alpha-lactalbumin IgG levels in patient serum samples using the
ELISA method.
2. SCOPE This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel who perform
the Alpha-lactalbumin IgG assay as part of diagnostic testing for
patients suspected of having food allergies or intolerance, specifically
to dairy products.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• It is the responsibility of laboratory technologists to perform the
assay as prescribed and ensure the accuracy and validity of
results.
• Supervisors must review and validate results and ensure
adherence to quality control (QC) and quality assurance (QA)
protocols.
• It is the duty of all personnel to report any discrepancies or issues
encountered during the assay.
4. DEFINITION Alpha-lactalbumin IgG is an immunoglobulin G
specific to alpha-lactalbumin, a major protein present in cow's milk.
Detection and quantification of this antibody can aid in diagnosing
milk-related hypersensitivity.
5. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
• ELISA reader
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Microcentrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Plate washer
• Incubator
• Multichannel pipette
• Alpha-lactalbumin IgG ELISA Kit (includes microtiter plates pre-
coated with antigen, enzyme conjugate, substrate solution, stop
solution, wash buffer, and standards)
• Deionized water
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
6. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND HANDLING
• Preferred specimen: Serum
• Serum must be separated from the blood within 2 hours of
collection.
• Store serum specimens at 2-8°C if assayed within 48 hours or
freeze at -20°C for longer storage.
• Thaw and mix samples gently before analysis.
• Unacceptable specimens:
◦ Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples
◦ Specimens stored at inappropriate temperatures or beyond
stability period (2-8°C >48 hours, -20°C for >6 months)
7. PROCEDURE 7.1 Preparation of Reagents
• Equilibrate all reagents to room temperature (18-25°C) before
use.
• Prepare wash buffer as instructed by the kit insert (typically by
diluting concentrated buffer with deionized water).
7.2 Assay Procedure
1. Standard and Sample Addition
◦ Set up the wells of the microtiter plate: designate wells for
blank, standards, controls, and patient samples.
◦ Pipette 100 µL of standards, controls, and samples in
duplicate into designated wells.
2. Enzyme Conjugate Addition
◦ Add 50 µL of enzyme conjugate to each well.
◦ Mix gently by tapping the plate.
3. Incubation
◦ Cover the plate with a plate sealer.
◦ Incubate the plate for 60 minutes at room temperature
(18-25°C).
4. Washing
◦ Wash the plate 5 times with 300 µL of wash buffer. Ensure
thorough aspiration after each wash cycle.
5. Substrate Addition
◦ Add 100 µL of substrate solution to each well.
◦ Incubate for 15 minutes at room temperature in the dark.
6. Stop Reaction
◦ Add 50 µL of stop solution to each well to stop the
enzymatic reaction.
◦ Gently tap the plate to ensure thorough mixing.
7. Reading the Plate
◦ Measure the absorbance at 450 nm using an ELISA reader
within 30 minutes of adding the stop solution.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run both positive and negative controls along with each batch of
patient samples.
• QC results must fall within the established ranges before patient
results can be reported.
• Any deviations from acceptable QC ranges require investigation
and resolution prior to reporting patient results.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
• Generate a standard curve from the absorbance of standards and
calculate concentrations of patient samples using the curve.
• Report results in mg/L (or the appropriate units specified by the
kit).
10. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to the ELISA kit package insert for limitations specific to the
assay.
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or severely icteric samples may interfere with
results.
• Cross-reactivity with other antibodies must be considered.
11. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Normal reference intervals are provided by the manufacturer and
should be used as a guideline. Specific reference intervals may
be established based on patient population and clinical context.
12. SAFETY AND WASTE MANAGEMENT
• Wear appropriate PPE during the assay (lab coat, gloves, safety
glasses).
• Dispose of all biohazardous waste according to local, state, and
federal regulations.
