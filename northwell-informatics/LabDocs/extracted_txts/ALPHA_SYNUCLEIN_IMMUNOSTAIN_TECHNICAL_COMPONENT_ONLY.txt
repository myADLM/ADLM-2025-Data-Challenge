Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for ALPHA SYNUCLEIN
IMMUNOSTAIN, TECHNICAL COMPONENT ONLY
1. PURPOSE
To provide a consistent procedure for the technical component of
performing alpha-synuclein immunostaining on tissue specimens
using standardized methods, to ensure accurate and reliable results.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of designated laboratory personnel to perform
the alpha-synuclein immunostaining according to this SOP and
document all necessary steps appropriately. Supervisors are
responsible for ensuring compliance with the procedure and
addressing any issues that may arise.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE)
tissue sections.
• Specimen Thickness: Cut sections at 4-5 microns thick.
• Labeling: Each specimen should be clearly labeled with patient
information, accession number, and date of collection.
1. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• Primary antibody specific for alpha-synuclein (commercially
available, e.g., from a validated supplier).
• Secondary antibody (biotinylated or conjugated with a suitable
detection marker).
• Detection system (e.g., DAB substrate or equivalent chromogen).
• Positive and negative control tissues.
• Buffer solutions (e.g., PBS, antigen retrieval solution).
• Mounting media and coverslips.
1. EQUIPMENT
• Microtome for sectioning paraffin-embedded tissue.
• Staining racks and dishes.
• Incubator or oven for heat-induced antigen retrieval.
• Bright-field microscope for result evaluation.
1. PROCEDURE
2. Preparation of Tissue Sections
◦ Cut tissue sections at 4-5 microns thickness.
◦ Place sections on positively charged glass slides.
◦ Dry slides at 37°C overnight or incubate at 60°C for 1-2
hours.
3. Deparaffinization and Rehydration
◦ Deparaffinize sections using xylene for 2 x 5 minutes.
◦ Rehydrate through graded alcohols to distilled water (100%,
95%, 70% alcohol).
4. Antigen Retrieval
◦ Perform heat-induced antigen retrieval using citrate buffer
(pH 6.0) or other validated retrieval solution.
◦ Microwave or pressure-cooker method: Heat for 20 minutes,
then cool for 20 minutes in retrieval solution.
5. Blocking
◦ Incubate sections with blocking buffer (e.g., 3% BSA or
serum blocking solution) for 30 minutes to reduce non-
specific binding.
6. Primary Antibody Incubation
◦ Dilute alpha-synuclein primary antibody to the
recommended concentration in antibody diluent.
◦ Incubate sections in primary antibody solution for 1 hour at
room temperature or overnight at 4°C.
7. Secondary Antibody Incubation
◦ Rinse sections in PBS.
◦ Incubate sections with secondary antibody (biotinylated or
conjugated) according to the manufacturer’s instructions
(usually 30 minutes at room temperature).
8. Detection and Visualization
◦ Rinse sections in PBS.
◦ Incubate sections with DAB substrate solution until a
suitable color develops (2-10 minutes).
◦ Wash in distilled water to stop the reaction.
9. Counterstaining
◦ Counterstain with hematoxylin for nuclei visualization (1-2
minutes).
◦ Rinse in water, then dehydrate through graded alcohols and
clear in xylene.
10. Mounting
◦ Apply mounting media and coverslip.
11. QUALITY CONTROL
• Use positive and negative control tissues with each staining batch
to validate antibody performance and staining consistency.
• Document each run in the alpha-synuclein Immunostaining Log,
including reagent lot numbers, incubation times, and any
deviations from the SOP.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results are to be reviewed under a microscope and checked for
staining quality and specificity by a trained technologist.
• Document observations and any issues with staining in the
logbook.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Reference ranges are not applicable for the technical component.
Results are qualitative based on the staining patterns observed.
1. LIMITATIONS
• The performance and interpretation of alpha-synuclein
immunostaining can be affected by tissue fixation, processing,
and staining protocol variations.
• Ensure complete deparaffinization and appropriate antigen
retrieval to achieve optimal staining.
1. REFERENCES
Relevant literature and manufacturer’s instructions for antibodies and
reagents used must be consulted and followed.
