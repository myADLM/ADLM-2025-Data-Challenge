Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for ALPORT (COLLAGEN IV ALPHA 5 AND
ALPHA 2) IMMUNOFLUORESCENT STAIN, RENAL BIOPSY
1. PURPOSE
This document outlines the procedures for performing
immunofluorescent staining for COL4A5 and COL4A2 proteins in
renal biopsy samples, including the preparation, staining, and
microscopic analysis, to aid in the diagnosis of Alport Syndrome and
other related renal conditions.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory personnel to carry
out the steps outlined in this SOP. The supervisor ensures that all
personnel understand and comply with the procedure.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type: Renal biopsy Specimen Preservation: Fresh
frozen sections preferred, stored at -80°C until analysis. Fixed
sections can be used as an alternative. Transport Conditions:
Specimens should be transported on dry ice if frozen, or kept at 4°C
if fixed, and must be transported to the laboratory promptly.
4. REAGENTS
• Primary antibodies: Rabbit anti-human COL4A5, Rabbit anti-
human COL4A2
• Secondary antibodies: Anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to fluorescent
dye (e.g., Alexa Fluor 488)
• Blocking solution: 5% normal goat serum in PBS
• Wash buffer: Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)
• Mounting medium: Fluoromount-G or equivalent
5. EQUIPMENT
• Cryostat for sectioning frozen samples or a microtome for fixed
samples
• Tissue bath for heating block sections
• Humid chamber for incubation
• Fluorescent microscope equipped with appropriate filters
• Slides and cover slips
• Timer for incubation periods
6. PROCEDURE
Preparation of Tissue Sections:
1. Cryosectioning: Use a cryostat to cut 4-6 micron thick sections
from the frozen renal biopsy.
◦ Fixed tissue: If using fixed tissue, cut sections using a
microtome.
2. Place tissue sections onto treated slides suitable for
immunofluorescence.
Immunofluorescent Staining:
1. Blocking:
◦ Incubate slides with tissue sections in blocking solution (5%
normal goat serum in PBS) for 1 hour at room temperature
in a humid chamber to prevent nonspecific binding.
2. Primary Antibody Incubation:
◦ Dilute primary antibodies (Rabbit anti-human COL4A5 and
Rabbit anti-human COL4A2) in PBS as per manufacturer's
instructions.
◦ Apply the diluted primary antibodies to the tissue sections
and incubate overnight at 4°C in a humid chamber.
3. Washing:
◦ Wash slides three times with PBS for 5 minutes each wash.
4. Secondary Antibody Incubation:
◦ Dilute anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to fluorescent dye in PBS
as per manufacturer's instructions.
◦ Apply the secondary antibody to the tissue sections and
incubate for 1 hour at room temperature in a humid
chamber.
5. Washing:
◦ Wash slides again three times with PBS for 5 minutes each
wash.
Mounting:
1. Apply a small amount of mounting medium on the tissue
sections.
2. Carefully place cover slips over the sections to avoid air
bubbles.
Microscopic Analysis:
1. Analyze stained sections using a fluorescent microscope fitted
with appropriate filters.
2. Visualize and document the presence and distribution of
COL4A5 and COL4A2 signals.
3. Assess and compare the staining patterns with control samples
to determine deviations indicative of Alport Syndrome or related
disorders.
Quality Control:
• Include positive and negative controls in every staining batch.
• Review control sections to establish any non-specific binding or
technical issues in the staining process.
• Results should be verified by a second qualified technologist if
discrepancies arise.
Reporting Results:
Document findings promptly. Include detailed notes on the presence,
intensity, and distribution pattern of COL4A5 and COL4A2 signals.
Report findings and interpretations to the pathologist for final review.
References:
For information on antibody dilution and staining specifics, refer to
the manufacturer's product insert for anti-collagen IV antibodies and
secondary antibodies.
7. LIMITATIONS
• Proper specimen preservation and handling are crucial for valid
results. Degraded or improperly handled samples may provide
non-informative or misleading results.
• Interference related to non-specific binding or autofluorescence
must be evaluated and controlled.
8. SAFETY
All procedures involving human samples must comply with safety
guidelines for handling biological materials. Wear appropriate
personal protective equipment (PPE) and follow protocols for
disposal of biohazardous waste.
9. DOCUMENTATION
Ensure all steps, findings, and discrepancies are logged in the
appropriate laboratory records. This documentation supports
traceability and ensures compliance with CLIA standards.
