STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP) ALPORT
SYNDROME GENE PANEL (VARIES) TESTING
1. PURPOSE To establish a standardized procedure for
processing and analyzing specimens for the Alport Syndrome
Gene Panel (VARIES). This protocol ensures the accuracy,
precision, and reproducibility of the test results to support the
diagnosis of Alport Syndrome.
Responsibility:
• Designated molecular technologists are responsible for
performing and documenting the analysis steps described in this
procedure.
• Laboratory supervisors are responsible for verifying the
compliance of the procedure and the accuracy of the results.
1. DEFINITION Alport Syndrome is a genetic disorder
characterized by kidney disease, hearing loss, and eye
abnormalities. Early genetic diagnosis can assist in clinical
management and inform at-risk family members.
2. PROCEDURE
3.1 Specimen Requirements
• Specimen Type: Peripheral blood, buccal cells, or saliva.
• Volume:
◦ Peripheral blood: 5-10 mL collected in EDTA tubes.
◦ Buccal cells: Two buccal swabs.
◦ Saliva: 2-4 mL collected in a DNA stabilization collection kit.
• Transport and Storage:
◦ Blood samples should be kept at 4°C and processed within 72
hours.
◦ Buccal cells and saliva samples can be stored at room
temperature and processed within 14 days.
3.2 Reagent and Supplies
• DNA extraction kits (validated for sample type).
• PCR reagents and primer sets specific to the Alport Syndrome
gene panel.
• NGS (Next-Generation Sequencing) library preparation kits.
• Sequencing platform (e.g., Illumina MiSeq, Ion Torrent).
• Bioinformatics software for data analysis.
3.3 Procedure Steps
3.3.1 DNA Extraction
1. Follow the manufacturer's protocol for DNA extraction.
2. Measure and record DNA concentration and purity using a
spectrophotometer.
3. If the DNA is of sufficient quality (A260/280 ratio of 1.8-2.0),
proceed to the next step. If not, re-extract or purify the DNA.
3.3.2 PCR Amplification
1. Prepare PCR master mix according to the primer sets designed
for the Alport Syndrome gene panel.
2. Add DNA template to the master mix.
3. Set up PCR cycling conditions as specified in the primer
instruction set.
4. Verify PCR amplification by running 5 µL of the product on an
agarose gel.
3.3.3 Library Preparation and Sequencing
1. Follow the NGS library preparation kit instructions to prepare
the amplified DNA for sequencing.
2. Quantify and normalize the library concentrations.
3. Load the prepared libraries onto the sequencing platform.
4. Configure the sequencing run according to the manufacturer's
guidelines for the gene panel.
3.3.4 Data Analysis
1. Transfer the sequencing output data to the bioinformatics
pipeline.
2. Perform quality control checks on raw sequence data.
3. Align sequences to the human reference genome (hg19 or
hg38).
4. Identify variants using validated software.
5. Filter and annotate variants pertinent to Alport Syndrome.
3.4 Quality Control
• Include positive controls (known Alport Syndrome mutations) and
negative controls (non-template) in each run.
• Validate new lots of reagents and release new batches only after
passing the appropriate quality control checks.
• Perform bi-weekly internal quality assessments.
3.5 Reporting
• Compile results into a summarized report.
• Include variant interpretation based on current clinical knowledge
and databases.
• Peer-reviewed by a second qualified technologist or supervisor
prior to release.
• Results shall be verified before being sent to the ordering
physician.
3.6 Documentation and Record Keeping
• Document all steps in the laboratory information system (LIS).
• Store all paper and digital records according to the laboratory
retention policy.
• Maintain logs of specimen receipt, DNA extraction, PCR setup,
sequencing runs, and data analysis.
1. LIMITATIONS
• Negative results do not exclude the diagnosis of Alport Syndrome,
especially if the clinical suspicion is high.
• Variants of unknown significance (VUS) must be interpreted within
the clinical context.
• Technical variations can occur due to DNA quality, PCR efficiency,
and sequencing depth.
1. REFERENCES
• Refer to manufacturer's guidelines for the specific kits and
instruments used.
• Relevant literature on Alport Syndrome and mutation databases
(e.g., ClinVar, HGMD).

preparation, and data analysis.

based on advancements in technology and scientific knowledge.
