Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analysis of Alprazolam
(Xanax)
1. PURPOSE
This SOP provides detailed instructions for the analysis of alprazolam
(Xanax) in clinical laboratories to ensure the accuracy and reliability
of test results. The procedure outlines the steps for the preparation,
analysis, and reporting of results for serum/plasma samples received
for alprazolam testing.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel performing the
analysis of alprazolam at the defined facility using validated analytical
methods and instruments.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing and
documenting each step in this analytical process. It is the
responsibility of all personnel to identify any discrepancies or issues
during the analysis and to bring them to the attention of the
supervisor immediately.
4. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
• High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) or Liquid
Chromatography–Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)
• Analytical balance
• Centrifuge
• Micropipettes and tips
• Vortex mixer
• Refrigerator and Freezer
• Calibrated thermometers (traceable to NIST standards)
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
• Alprazolam reference standards
• Reagents and solvents (HPLC grade)
◦ Mobile phase components (e.g., acetonitrile, methanol, water,
formic acid)
◦ Internal standard
◦ Sample diluent
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENT AND HANDLING
Preferred/Acceptable Specimen:
• Serum/plasma samples with specified volume (typically 1-2 mL)
• Collected in red-top or purple-top EDTA tubes
• Samples should be stored at 2-8°C and analyzed within 7 days of
collection or stored at -20°C for longer periods.
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Samples with visible hemolysis
• Improper labeling or insufficient volume
• Samples stored beyond the stability window without proper
handling
6. PROCEDURE
6.1. Specimen Preparation
1. Upon receipt of the specimen, confirm patient details, sample
type, and match with requisition form.
2. Centrifuge the specimen at 1500-2000 x g for 10 minutes to
obtain a clear supernatant (serum/plasma).
3. Transfer the clear supernatant to a clean labeled container.
6.2. Standard Preparation
1. Prepare calibration standards using alprazolam reference
standards at a range relevant to clinical interpretation (e.g., 0.5
to 50 ng/mL).
2. Include an internal standard at a fixed concentration in all
standards, controls, and samples.
6.3. Quality Control
1. Utilize quality control (QC) samples at low, medium, and high
concentrations within the calibration range.
2. Ensure QC samples are analyzed with each batch of patient
samples and that they fall within acceptable limits.
6.4. Instrument Preparation
1. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for daily startup and
calibration procedures for HPLC or LC-MS/MS.
2. Set up the instrument with appropriate analytical columns and
mobile phases.
3. Perform system suitability tests ensuring acceptable baseline
stability, resolution, and reproducibility.
6.5. Sample Analysis
1. Vortex the sample briefly to ensure homogeneity.
2. Pipette an aliquot of the sample (e.g., 0.5 mL) into a clean vial;
add the internal standard if not pre-added.
3. Add the appropriate sample diluent to the vial, vortex to mix
thoroughly.
4. Load the sample vial into the HPLC or LC-MS/MS autosampler.
5. Run the analysis using the predefined method.
6.6. Data Acquisition and Processing
1. Acquire data and ensure baseline resolution and peak
identification.
2. Integrate peaks and quantify the concentration of alprazolam in
the sample using the calibration curve.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Review the results and quality control data.
2. Confirm that QC samples fall within the predefined acceptable
ranges.
3. Report the alprazolam concentration in the patient sample.
4. Enter the results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS) for
verification and final reporting.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolysis, lipemia, or icterus may interfere with the analysis.
• Use of whole blood, urine, or any sample type other than serum/
plasma will require additional validation.

methods.
10. DOCUMENTATION AND RECORD KEEPING
1. Maintain records of all instrument calibrations, reagent
preparation, QC results, and patient results.
2. Ensure documentation is accurate, complete, and readily
retrievable for review and audit purposes.
