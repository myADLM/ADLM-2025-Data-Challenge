Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase for Generating Results for Alternaria
Tenuis, IgE, Serum
1. Purpose The purpose of this SOP is to ensure the accurate and
reliable analysis of Alternaria Tenuis-specific Immunoglobulin E (IgE)
in serum specimens. This protocol outlines the procedures for the
preparation, testing, and result reporting of Alternaria Tenuis, IgE
serum analysis.
2. Scope This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel performing
Alternaria Tenuis, IgE analysis using specific IgE testing methods,
such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or
fluoroenzyme immunoassay (FEIA).
3. Responsibilities
• It is the responsibility of the laboratory technologist to perform the
testing procedure according to this SOP and ensure accurate
documentation and reporting of results.
• It is the responsibility of the supervisor to ensure that all
personnel are trained in this SOP and that appropriate quality
control measures are in place.
4. Specimen Requirements
• Specimen type: Serum
• Volume: A minimum of 1 mL of serum is required for testing.
• Collection: Blood should be collected in a serum separator tube
(SST) and allowed to clot at room temperature for 30 minutes to 1
hour.
• Processing: Centrifuge the SST for 10-15 minutes at 3000 RPM.
Carefully pipette the serum into a labeled polypropylene tube.
• Storage: Serum samples may be stored at 2-8°C for up to 7 days.
For long-term storage, keep frozen at -20°C or colder.
5. Reagents and Supplies
• Specific IgE testing kits for Alternaria Tenuis (e.g., ELISA or FEIA
kits)
• Calibrators and controls provided with the testing kits
• Pipettes and tips
• Microplate reader (for ELISA) or immunoassay analyzer (for
FEIA)
• Polypropylene tubes
• Disposable gloves and laboratory coat
• Deionized water
6. Procedure A. Preparation
1. Bring all reagents and samples to room temperature (18-25°C)
before starting the assay.
2. Ensure the testing instrument is calibrated and quality control
procedures are performed according to the manufacturer’s
guidelines.
B. Assay Procedure (ELISA)
1. Add appropriate volumes of calibrators, controls, and serum
samples to the designated wells of the microplate.
2. Add the detection antibody (specific for human IgE) to all wells.
3. Incubate the microplate at the recommended temperature and
time as specified in the kit insert.
4. Wash the plate thoroughly with the washing buffer provided to
remove unbound reagents.
5. Add the substrate solution to all wells and incubate for the time
specified.
6. Add the stop solution to each well to halt the reaction.
7. Measure the absorbance of each well at the specified
wavelength using a microplate reader.
OR
B. Assay Procedure (FEIA)
1. Add appropriate volumes of calibrators, controls, and serum
samples to the designated wells of the assay plate or directly
onto the test cartridges.
2. Place the loaded plate or cartridges into the immunoassay
analyzer.
3. Follow the analyzer prompts to complete the assay, including
necessary incubation and wash steps.
4. The analyzer will detect and measure fluorescence,
corresponding to the IgE concentration in the serum samples.
C. Calculation and Interpretation of Results
1. Generate a standard curve using the values obtained from the
calibrators.
2. Determine the concentration of Alternaria Tenuis-specific IgE in
each sample by comparing the sample absorbance values
(ELISA) or fluorescence values (FEIA) to the standard curve.
3. The specific IgE concentration will be expressed in kU/L or IU/
mL.
7. Quality Control
• Run both the positive and negative controls with each assay
batch.
• Ensure the control values fall within the acceptable range
provided by the kit manufacturer.
• If control values are outside acceptable limits, troubleshoot and
repeat the assay until results are within the acceptable range.
8. Reporting Results
• Report the findings based on the laboratory’s reporting guidelines.
• Note any significant deviations or issues encountered during the
assay in the laboratory information system (LIS).
• Results should be reviewed and validated by the technologist.
9. Reference Intervals
• Reference ranges for specific IgE levels should be provided in the
kit insert and may vary depending on the assay method used.
• Typically, IgE <0.35 kU/L indicates a negative or non-sensitized
result, while higher levels may indicate sensitization to Alternaria
Tenuis.
10. Method Limitations
• Cross-reactivity with other allergens can potentially lead to false-
positive results.
• Serum IgE levels can be affected by extrinsic factors, including
total IgE levels and concurrent infections.
• Ensure all reagents are used within their expiration dates and
follow all instructions provided by the assay manufacturer.

Tenuis.

By following this SOP, the laboratory ensures consistent, accurate,
and reliable results for Alternaria Tenuis, IgE serum analysis.
