Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Alternative Complement Pathway, Functional,
Serum
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is to
outline the necessary steps and quality control measures to ensure
the accurate and precise testing of the Alternative Complement
Pathway, Functional, in serum samples.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of all laboratory personnel to adhere to this
SOP and ensure that all procedural steps are followed correctly. Any
deviations or issues must be immediately reported to the laboratory
supervisor.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type:
• Serum
Specimen Collection:
• Collect blood using standard venipuncture technique.
• Use a red-top tube or serum separator tube (SST).
• Allow the blood to clot for at least 30 minutes at room temperature
before centrifugation.
Specimen Volume:
• Minimum volume: 1 mL serum
Specimen Handling:
• Centrifuge the sample at 1500 x g for 10 minutes.
• Transfer the serum into a labeled transport tube.
• Serum should be stored and transported on ice or frozen if testing
is not immediate.
• Specimen stability: Refrigerated (2-8°C) up to 48 hours; Frozen
(-20°C or colder) for longer storage.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Plate reader capable of reading at 405 nm
• Calibrated pipettes and tips
• Microplate washer
• Conjugate and substrate solutions
• Serum controls (normal and deficient)
• Alternative Complement Pathway Functional Assay Kit
(commercially available)
◦ Diluent
◦ Activation buffer
◦ Wash buffer
◦ Standard/reference serum
◦ Detection antibodies
1. PROCEDURE
A) Preparing the Samples and Controls:
1. Thaw frozen serum samples, controls, and reagents at room
temperature.
2. Prepare serial dilutions of the standard/reference serum as per
the manufacturer's instructions.
B) Assay Procedure:
1. Dilution:
• Dilute serum samples and controls with the provided diluent as
described in the kit insert.
• Typically, make a 1:10 initial dilution (e.g., 10 µL of serum with 90
µL of diluent).
1. Plate Setup:
• Add 100 µL of each diluted serum sample, control, and standard
reference into assigned wells of the microtiter plate in duplicate.
1. Incubation:
• Incubate the microtiter plate at 37°C for 30 minutes to allow
complement activation.
• Wash the plate using the microplate washer with the wash buffer
provided. (Follow wash steps as recommended in the kit insert).
1. Detection:
• Add 100 µL of the detection antibody to each well and incubate at
room temperature for 30 minutes.
• Wash the plate as per kit instructions.
1. Substrate Addition:
• Add 100 µL of substrate solution to each well.
• Incubate at room temperature in the dark until color development
is sufficient (typically 10-20 minutes).
1. Stopping the Reaction:
• Add 50 µL of the stop solution to each well to halt the reaction.
1. Reading the Plate:
• Read the absorbance at 405 nm using a plate reader.
• Ensure a proper blank is used to calibrate the reader.
C) Data Analysis:
1. Calculate the mean absorbance for each set of duplicate wells
for samples, controls, and standards.
2. Generate a standard curve using the absorbance values of the
standard/reference serum dilutions.
3. Determine the functional activity of the alternative complement
pathway in each sample by interpolation from the standard
curve.
4. Report results in CH50 units per mL (CH50/mL).
5. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run all quality controls (normal and deficient) with each batch of
samples.
• Ensure QC results fall within acceptable ranges before reporting
patient results.
• Document and troubleshoot any discrepancies in QC results and
take corrective actions as necessary.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Input results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Verify results against expected reference intervals.
• Reference interval for Alternative Complement Pathway,
Functional:
◦ Normal range: X-Y CH50/mL (Specific values to be
determined based on in-house validation).
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolyzed or lipemic samples could interfere with the assay and
should be avoided, if possible.
• Cross-reactivity with other complement components may impact
specificity. Refer to the assay kit insert for detailed limitations.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's kit insert and instructions.
• Relevant scientific literature and clinical guidelines.
1. DOCUMENTATION
• Record all procedural steps, QC results, and any deviations in
designated log books.
• Maintain records for a minimum of two years or according to
institutional requirements.
By following the above SOP, laboratory personnel ensure the
reliability and accuracy of the Alternative Complement Pathway,
Functional, serum assay results. Regular training and proficiency
testing should be conducted to maintain high testing standards.
