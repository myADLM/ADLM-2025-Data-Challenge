Standard Operating Procedure: Analysis of Aluminum in 24 Hour
Urine
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standard procedure for the accurate and precise
analysis of aluminum in 24-hour urine specimens using inductively
coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS).
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel involved in testing
aluminum levels in 24-hour urine samples.
3. RESPONSIBILITIES
• Laboratory Technologists: Perform the analysis and ensure the
procedure is followed correctly.
• Supervisors: Oversee all operations to ensure adherence to this
SOP and address any deficiencies or anomalies.
4. SPECIMEN COLLECTION AND HANDLING
• Specimen Type: 24-hour urine.
• Collection Container: Clean, acid-washed plastic or glass
container.
• Transportation: Store at 2-8°C and transport to the laboratory
promptly.
5. REAGENTS, EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS
• Reagents:
◦ Trace element-free nitric acid
◦ High-purity water (resistivity ≥18 MΩ·cm)
◦ Certified aluminum standards for calibration
◦ Internal standard solution (e.g., yttrium)
• Equipment:
◦ Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer (ICP-MS)
◦ Acid-wash station
◦ Analytical balance
◦ Volumetric flasks
◦ Pipettes and micropipettes with disposable tips
◦ Centrifuge (if needed)
◦ pH meter
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• QC Material: Use certified reference materials at different
concentration levels for quality control.
• Frequency: Perform QC checks at the beginning of each batch.
• Acceptance Criteria: Control measurements must be within ±2
standard deviations of the mean established for the QC material.
7. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Ensure all reagents and equipment are prepared and calibrated
according to manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Acid-clean all glassware and plasticware to be used in the
analysis.
3. Prepare the calibration standards using certified aluminum
standards.
Sample Preparation:
1. Mix Sample: Thoroughly mix the 24-hour urine collection to
ensure homogeneity.
2. Aliquot Sample: Take an appropriate volume of urine (usually
5-10 mL) using an acid-washed pipette.
3. Acidification: Dilute an aliquot of urine with trace element-free
nitric acid (1+5 v/v ratio) to stabilize aluminum.
4. Centrifugation: If the urine sample contains particulate matter,
centrifuge the sample and transfer the supernatant to a clean
tube.
5. Dilution: Prepare diluted urine samples as necessary to fall
within the range of calibration standards.
Instrument Setup and Calibration:
1. Set up the ICP-MS according to standard operating procedures.
2. Perform a calibration using aluminum standards prepared in the
same matrix as the samples.
3. Include an internal standard (e.g., yttrium) to correct for any
potential variances in signal due to matrix effects or
instrumental fluctuations.
Analysis:
1. Sequence: Begin the run with a blank, followed by calibration
standards, QC samples, and then urine samples.
2. Detection: Analyze samples using ICP-MS and monitor for
aluminum peaks.
3. Internal Standardization: Ensure consistent recovery of the
internal standard throughout the run.
Calculation and Reporting:
1. Data Review: Review data for all QC samples. If QC results fall
within the established range, proceed with the sample results.
2. Quantification: Calculate the concentration of aluminum in the
urine samples using the calibration curve.
3. Result Expression: Express results as µg/L of aluminum.
4. Calculation for 24-hour Urine Total: Calculate the total
amount of aluminum excreted in 24 hours using the total
volume of urine collected.
Total Aluminum (µg/24 hours) = Concentration (µg/L) x Total
Volume (L)
8. REPORTING RESULTS
Follow the laboratory’s standard protocol for entering and verifying
results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS). Verify all results
before release.
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Ensure accurate and precise pipetting.
• Properly correct for any matrix effects using an appropriate
internal standard.
• Minimize potential sample contamination from external sources of
aluminum.
