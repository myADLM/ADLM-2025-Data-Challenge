Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
1. PURPOSE To define the procedure for the analytical phase of
generating results for Aluminum/Creatinine Ratio in random urine
samples.
Responsibility: It is the responsibility of the clinical laboratory staff to
perform and document the analytical steps required for the accurate
measurement and reporting of the Aluminum/Creatinine Ratio in
random urine samples.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS Preferred/Acceptable:
• A random urine sample collected in a clean, plastic urine
container.
• Minimum volume required: 10 mL.
Unacceptable:
• Specimen volume less than the minimum required.
• Specimens that are visibly contaminated or contain sediments or
precipitates.
• Specimens collected in non-recommended containers.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES Equipment:
• Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer (ICP-MS)
• Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer (AAS) for Aluminum
analysis
• Clinical Chemistry Analyzer for Creatinine measurement
Reagents:
• Standard solutions for Aluminum
• Calibration standards for Creatinine
• Nitric acid (HNO3) for sample preparation
• Deionized water
Supplies:
• Clean plastic consumables
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Calibration and quality control samples for Aluminum and
Creatinine
4. PROCEDURE A) Sample Preparation:
1. Mix the urine sample thoroughly before aliquoting.
2. Pipette an appropriate volume (e.g., 1-5 mL) of urine into a
clean plastic tube for Aluminum and Creatinine analysis.
3. For Aluminum analysis, add an equal volume of nitric acid (e.g.,
3 mL 50% HNO3 per 3 mL of urine sample). Mix well.
4. Centrifuge the sample preparation tube if needed to remove
any particulates.
B) Aluminum Measurement by ICP-MS:
1. Calibrate the ICP-MS using aluminum standard solutions
prepared in the same matrix as the specimens.
2. Perform instrument calibration and verify that standards fall
within the acceptable range.
3. Run the prepared urine samples through the ICP-MS.
4. Record the Aluminum concentration in µg/L.
C) Creatinine Measurement by Clinical Chemistry Analyzer:
1. Calibrate the clinical chemistry analyzer using creatinine
standard solutions.
2. Perform quality control checks to ensure calibration curve
accuracy.
3. Run the neat urine sample on the analyzer to measure
creatinine concentration.
4. Record the creatinine concentration in mg/dL or mmol/L.
D) Calculation of Aluminum/Creatinine Ratio:
1. Convert the Aluminum concentration from µg/L to the same unit
as Creatinine if necessary.
2. Use the following formula to calculate Aluminum/Creatinine
Ratio:
[ \text{Aluminum/Creatinine Ratio} = \frac{\text{Aluminum
concentration (µg/L)}}{\text{Creatinine concentration (mg/dL)}} ]
E) Quality Control:
1. Include at least two levels of quality control (QC) material with
each batch of samples analyzed.
2. Record QC results and verify they are within acceptable limits.
3. Take corrective actions and reanalyze if QC results fall outside
acceptable limits.
5. REPORTING RESULTS: Reference Range:
• Provide reference intervals specific to your laboratory’s
established document.
Results Interpretation:
• Review analyzed results ensuring they are consistent with QC
results and within the instrument’s operational parameters.
• Report the Aluminum/Creatinine Ratio and flag any values that
deviate from the established normal range.
Documentation:
• Record and verify results in the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
• Highlight or note any abnormal or critical results per laboratory
protocols and communicate them as necessary.
6. REFERENCES:
• ICP-MS or AAS operational manuals.
• Clinical Chemistry Analyzer user manual for Creatinine
measurement.
• Laboratory-specific quality assurance programs and guidelines.
• Relevant clinical and laboratory guidelines for urine aluminum and
creatinine assays.
Ensure this SOP is validated, regularly reviewed, and updated in light
of advanced practices and emerging standards.
