Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Aluminum/Creatinine
Ratio, Urine
1. PURPOSE
To describe the procedure for determining the Aluminum/Creatinine
Ratio in urine samples. This test measures the amount of aluminum
in the urine relative to the amount of creatinine, which helps
normalize aluminum excretion relative to kidney function.
Responsibility: The laboratory technologist processing the urine
samples is responsible for following this protocol and ensuring
accurate and precise results.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all personnel involved in the preparation,
analysis, and reporting of Aluminum/Creatinine Ratio in the
designated Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-
certified laboratory.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENT
Specimen Type:
• Random urine sample, preferred.
• 24-hour urine sample, acceptable but document the exact
collection times on the requisition.
Specimen Volume:
• Preferred: 10-20 mL of urine.
Specimen Container:
• Urine collection cup.
• For 24-hour collection: Standard 24-hour urine collection
container.
Specimen Storage and Stability:
• Store at 2-8°C and analyze within 7 days.
• If samples are to be stored for longer than 7 days, they should be
frozen at -20°C for up to 1 month.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens with visible contamination.
• Specimens without proper labeling (patient name, date, and time
of collection).
• Specimens collected in containers with inappropriate
preservatives.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer (ICP-MS) for
Aluminum analysis.
• Automated Chemistry Analyzer for Creatinine analysis.
• Standard laboratory pipettes and tips.
Reagents:
• Aluminum standards and calibration solutions.
• Creatinine reagents.
• Deionized water.
• Quality control materials for aluminum and creatinine.
5. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation of Standards and Quality Controls
• Prepare Aluminum standards according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
• Ensure creatinine reagents and quality control materials are in
compliance with the appropriate standards.
• Run the QC samples before patient samples run to ensure the
analytical systems are functioning properly.
B. Sample Preparation
• Mix the urine sample well before aliquotting.
• Transfer 1-2 mL of the urine sample to appropriately labeled
sample tubes.
• If the sample appears cloudy, centrifuge at 3000 RPM for 5
minutes to remove particulates.
• Ensure samples are at room temperature before analysis.
C. Aluminum Analysis Using ICP-MS
1. Calibrate the ICP-MS with aluminium standards.
2. Analyze the samples as per the instrument’s manufacturer’s
procedure.
3. Document the aluminum concentration in micrograms per liter
(µg/L).
D. Creatinine Analysis Using Automated Chemistry Analyzer
1. Calibrate the analyzer using creatinine standards.
2. Analyze the urine sample for creatinine concentration.
3. Document the creatinine concentration in milligrams per
deciliter (mg/dL).
E. Calculation of Aluminum/Creatinine Ratio
1. Normalize the aluminum result by converting µg/L to µg/dL.
2. Calculate the Aluminum/Creatinine ratio using the conversion:
Aluminum/Creatinine ratio (µg/g) = (Aluminum concentration
(µg/L) / Creatinine concentration (mg/dL)) * 100.
3. Ensure all data and calculations are documented accurately.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run quality control samples at the start of each analytical batch.
• Acceptable limits for QC samples must be within the predefined
range established by the laboratory.
• Re-calibrate instruments if QC results fall outside acceptable
ranges.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
• Review all analytical data for accuracy and precision.
• Enter results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS) and
ensure the final results are verified by a qualified technologist.
• Report the aluminum/creatinine ratio in micrograms of aluminum
per gram of creatinine (µg/g).
8. REFERENCE RANGES
• Normal-range values for Aluminum/Creatinine ratio will be
established by the laboratory based on population data or
predefined clinical references.
• Generally, Aluminum/Creatinine ratios should be interpreted in
conjunction with clinical findings and other diagnostic tests.
9. INTERFERENCES AND LIMITATIONS
• Hematuria and high levels of protein in urine may affect the
creatinine measurement.
• Other metal contaminants in the sample or from the collection
container may interfere with aluminum measurements.
• Always consider sample handling, storage, and transportation to
minimize contamination risk.

reagents used in the analysis.
