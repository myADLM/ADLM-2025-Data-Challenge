1. PURPOSE
This protocol outlines the procedures for the analytical phase of
determining aluminum levels in serum. It ensures accurate and
reliable results by following established methodologies and quality
control measures.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to the measurement of aluminum in serum
specimens using Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry
(ICP-MS) or Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (AAS) with Zeeman
background correction. It is intended for use by medical laboratory
scientists and other authorized personnel.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Laboratory Technologists: Responsible for performing the
analytical procedures as specified, including sample preparation,
instrument calibration, and measurement.
• Supervisors: Responsible for overseeing the testing process,
reviewing results, and ensuring compliance with the SOP.
4. DEFINITIONS
• Serum: The clear liquid part of the blood that remains after
coagulation.
• ICP-MS: A type of mass spectrometry that is capable of detecting
metals and several non-metals at low concentrations.
• AAS: A technique used for determining the concentration of a
particular metal element in a sample.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• ICP-MS or AAS instrument
• Calibration standards (traceable to NIST standards)
• Quality control materials
• Deionized water
• Nitric acid (trace metal grade)
• Sample digestion apparatus (if required)
• Laboratory glassware (certified for trace metal analysis)
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
• Disposable gloves
6. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred/Acceptable:
◦ Collect serum using standard venipuncture technique.
◦ Transfer serum to trace metal-free collection tubes (e.g., BD
Vacutainer® Trace Element Serum Tubes).
◦ Minimum volume: 1 mL of serum.
◦ Store and transport serum samples at 2-8°C.
• Unacceptable:
◦ Hemolyzed or lipemic samples.
◦ Samples in non-trace element-free collection tubes.
◦ Samples stored for over 72 hours without proper preservation.
7. PROCEDURE
7.1 Sample Preparation
1. Centrifuge serum samples at 1500 x g for 10 minutes to remove
cellular components.
2. Transfer the supernatant to a clean trace metal-free tube using
a disposable pipette.
3. If necessary, digest the serum sample using trace metal grade
nitric acid in a digestion apparatus according to manufacturer
instructions.
7.2 Calibration and Quality Control
1. Prepare calibration standards at a minimum of five different
concentrations covering the expected range of the samples.
2. Prepare quality control materials at low, medium, and high
levels within the calibration range.
3. Calibrate the instrument according to manufacturer's
instructions using the prepared standards.
4. Run quality control samples at the beginning, middle, and end
of each analytical batch.
7.3 Measurement
1. Load the serum samples, calibration standards, and quality
control materials onto the instrument.
2. Initiate the run on the ICP-MS or AAS following the instrument's
specific software and operational procedures.
3. Ensure that the sample sequence includes calibration
standards interspersed with unknown samples to monitor for
drift.
7.4 Result Verification
1. Verify that calibration standards and quality control samples fall
within the acceptable range.
2. Any samples with results outside the linear range of the
calibration curve must be diluted and reanalyzed.
3. Review all instrument flags and potential interferences noted
during the run.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Enter results from the instrument into the Laboratory
Information System (LIS) after review.
2. Reference interferences and reportable ranges must be noted
according to the laboratory's reporting guidelines.
3. Critical values should be immediately communicated to the
appropriate clinical personnel per established critical value
reporting procedures.
9. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Document all quality control data and maintain records
according to laboratory policy.
2. Investigate and resolve any quality control failures before
reporting patient results.
3. Perform instrument maintenance and calibration as per the
manufacturer’s recommendations and document all activities.
