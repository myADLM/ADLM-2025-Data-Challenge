Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for ALVEOLAR RHABDOMYOSARCOMA
(ARMS), 13q14 (FOXO1 or FKHR) Rearrangement, FISH, Tissue
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this document is to outline the procedures for the
analytical phase of generating results for Alveolar
Rhabdomyosarcoma (ARMS), 13q14 (FOXO1 or FKHR)
rearrangement using Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) in
tissue specimens, ensuring accurate results for appropriate diagnosis
and treatment planning.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
All designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing
the procedures as outlined in this SOP. It is the responsibility of all
staff to identify any issues during the analytical process and report
them to a supervisor.
1. DEFINITIONS
Alveolar Rhabdomyosarcoma (ARMS): A type of cancer that forms in
muscle tissue. FOXO1 (FKHR): A gene located at 13q14 frequently
rearranged in ARMS. FISH: Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization, a
molecular cytogenetic technique.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• FISH probe set specific for FOXO1 or FKHR rearrangement
• Microscope equipped with fluorescence capabilities
• Hybridization chamber
• Incubator
• Tissue slides
• Washing solutions
• Fixative solutions
• DAPI counterstain
• Mounting medium
• Coverslips
• General laboratory supplies (PPE, pipettes, etc.)
1. PROCEDURE
Specimen Preparation: a. Ensure the tissue samples are properly
fixed and embedded in paraffin. b. Section the tissue sample at 4-5
microns and mount the sections onto positively charged slides. c.
Deparaffinize tissue slides using appropriate clearing agents (e.g.,
xylene), followed by rehydration through a series of graded alcohols.
FISH Procedure: a. Pre-treatment of tissue slides: i. Immerse slides
in pretreatment solution (e.g., NaCl or protease) following the
manufacturer’s recommendations. ii. Wash slides in distilled water to
remove excess pretreatment solution. iii. Dehydrate slides in graded
alcohol series and air dry.
b. Denaturation and Hybridization: i. Denature the tissue DNA by
applying denaturation solution and incubating at the specified
temperature and time according to kit instructions. ii. Apply the FISH
probe mixture to the denatured tissue section on each slide. iii. Cover
the slides with coverslips and place in a hybridization chamber,
incubating overnight at 37°C for optimal probe hybridization.
c. Post-Hybridization Washes: i. Remove the slides from the
hybridization chamber and gently wash in post-hybridization solution
as recommended by the probe manufacturer. ii. Dehydrate slides
through a graded alcohol series and air dry.
d. Counterstaining and Mounting: i. Apply DAPI counterstain to allow
visualization of nuclei. ii. Mount slides with mounting medium and
cover with coverslips.
Microscopic Analysis: a. Using a fluorescence-equipped
microscope, examine the slides for the presence of FOXO1 or FKHR
rearrangement signals. b. Capture representative images of the
fluorescent signals. c. Review and interpret FISH results: i. Count the
number of positive signals in the nuclei. ii. Compare the number and
pattern of signals with control samples. iii. Determine the
rearrangement status: positive (presence of rearrangement signals)
or negative (absence of rearrangement signals).
Quality Control: a. Run positive and negative control slides
alongside patient samples to ensure assay accuracy. b. Document
any discrepancies and repeat testing if necessary.
1. DOCUMENTATION AND REPORTING
a. Record specimen identification, procedural details, and
observations in the laboratory information system (LIS). b. Verify the
analytical results with a second qualified technologist if required. c.
Final results should be reviewed and approved by a laboratory
supervisor or pathologist. d. Report the findings in the patient’s
medical record, including the interpretation of FOXO1 or FKHR
rearrangement status.
