1. PURPOSE
To provide an accurate and standardized procedure for the detection
of the ASPL-TFE3 gene fusion associated with Alveolar Soft Part
Sarcoma (ASPS) and TFE3 gene rearrangements in Renal Cell
Carcinoma (RCC) using Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH)
technique on tissue specimens.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for carrying out the
FISH procedure on tissue specimens and documenting all steps
according to this protocol. Supervisors are responsible for ensuring
proper execution and adherence to the protocol.
1. DEFINITION
Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) is a molecular cytogenetic
technique that uses fluorescent probes to detect specific DNA
sequences, enabling the identification of genetic abnormalities. This
protocol focuses on detecting the TFE3 gene rearrangement at
XP11.23.
1. PROCEDURE
Specimen Requirements:
Acceptable:
• Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue block or
unstained slides (4-5 µm thick)
Unacceptable:
• Specimens insufficient in quantity or quality
• Poorly preserved or degraded tissue samples
Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies:
• Microtome
• Water bath
• Hotplate
• Xylene
• Ethanol (70%, 85%, 96%, and 100%)
• Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)
• Citric acid (pH 6.0) or appropriate antigen retrieval solution
• Protease solution
• TFE3 break-apart FISH probe (commercially available)
• FISH hybridization buffer
• Rubber cement or hybridization coverslips
• Humidified chamber
• Fluorescence microscope with appropriate filters
Procedure:
A) Sample Preparation:
1. Sectioning:
◦ Cut 4-5 µm thick sections from the FFPE tissue block using
a microtome.
◦ Place sections on positively charged slides.
◦ Bake slides at 56-60°C for 1 hour to adhere sections to
slides.
2. Deparaffinization:
◦ Place slides in xylene for 3 x 5 minutes.
◦ Hydrate through a graded series of ethanol (100%, 96%,
85%, 70%) for 2 minutes each.
◦ Rinse slides in distilled water for 2 minutes.
3. Antigen Retrieval:
◦ Immerse slides in antigen retrieval solution (e.g., citric acid,
pH 6.0) and heat in a microwave or water bath at 95-100°C
for 15-20 minutes.
◦ Allow slides to cool for 20 minutes at room temperature.
◦ Rinse in PBS for 3 x 5 minutes.
4. Protease Treatment:
◦ Incubate slides in protease solution at 37°C for 10-20
minutes.
◦ Rinse slides in PBS for 3 x 5 minutes.
B) Hybridization:
1. Co-Denaturation and Hybridization:
◦ Apply 10 µL of TFE3 break-apart FISH probe to the target
area of each slide.
◦ Seal coverslip edges with rubber cement to prevent
evaporation.
◦ Denature slides at 75-80°C for 5-10 minutes.
◦ Hybridize in a humidified chamber at 37°C overnight (16-18
hours).
C) Post-Hybridization Wash and Detection:
1. Post-Hybridization Wash:
◦ Remove coverslips and rinse slides in 2 x SSC at room
temperature for 5 minutes.
◦ Perform a stringent wash in 0.4 x SSC/0.3% NP-40 at 72°C
for 2 minutes.
◦ Rinse slides in 2 x SSC/0.1% NP-40 at room temperature
for 1 minute.
2. Counterstaining:
◦ Apply DAPI counterstain to each slide and coverslip.
3. Visualization:
◦ Examine slides under a fluorescence microscope with
appropriate filter sets for DAPI and FISH probe signals.
◦ Capture and analyze images using specific software.
D) Interpretation and Reporting:
1. Interpret signals as follows:
◦ A normal TFE3 gene will show two color signals (one red
and one green) closely associated.
◦ A rearranged TFE3 gene will show separated red and green
signals (break-apart).
2. Record results and document findings in accordance with site-
specific reporting guidelines.
Quality Control:
1. Include a known positive and negative control with each batch
of tests.
2. Regularly check the microscope calibration and maintenance.
3. Verify that reagents and probes are stored as per manufacturer
instructions and not used beyond their expiry dates.
Limitations:
1. The quality of tissue preservation and slide preparation can
significantly affect the test results.
2. Interpretation of FISH results requires expertise in fluorescence
microscopy and familiarity with typical TFE3 signal patterns.

in FISH techniques, microscopy, and result interpretation. All steps
must be meticulously followed to ensure the accuracy and reliability
of test results.
