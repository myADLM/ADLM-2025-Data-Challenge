Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Title: Analytical Procedure for
Alzheimer Disease Evaluation in Spinal Fluid SOP Number: AD-
SF-001 Effective Date: [Insert Date] Review Date: [Insert Date]
Version: 1.0
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to provide a standardized procedure for
the analysis and evaluation of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) biomarkers
in spinal fluid (cerebrospinal fluid or CSF). Proper execution of this
protocol ensures consistency, accuracy, and reliability of laboratory
results.
1. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel who are responsible for
performing the analysis and evaluation of Alzheimer's Disease
biomarkers in spinal fluid.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
• Laboratory Technologists: Perform the analysis in accordance
with this SOP, document results, and report any abnormalities.
• Laboratory Supervisors: Ensure adherence to the SOP, review
and approve results, and provide troubleshooting support.
• Quality Control (QC) Personnel: Oversee quality control
measures and handle external proficiency testing.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND HANDLING
4.1 Specimen Collection
• CSF specimens must be collected via lumbar puncture by a
trained healthcare professional.
• Minimum volume required: 2 mL CSF.
• Collect in sterile, polypropylene tubes.
• Store samples at 4°C if analyzed within 24 hours. For longer
storage, freeze samples at -80°C without a freeze-thaw cycle.
4.2 Specimen Acceptance Criteria
• Specimens should be free from visible blood contamination.
• Specimens must be properly labeled with patient identification
and collection details.
• Reject incomplete, improperly labeled, or visibly contaminated
specimens.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
5.1 Equipment
• High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) or Mass
Spectrometry (MS)
• Pipettes and tips
• Centrifuge
• Vortex Mixer
• Incubator
• Analytical balance
5.2 Reagents
• Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS)
• Standard solutions for biomarkers (such as Amyloid-β, Tau, and
phosphorylated Tau proteins)
• Control materials
• Sample diluents
5.3 Supplies
• CSF collection tubes
• Microcentrifuge tubes
• Disposable gloves
• Calibration standards
1. PROCEDURE
6.1 Specimen Preparation
• Thaw frozen CSF samples on ice before analysis.
• Mix the CSF sample by gentle inversion or vortexing.
• Centrifuge the specimen at 3,000 RPM for 10 minutes to remove
any particulate matter.
• Aliquot the clear supernatant into clean microcentrifuge tubes.
6.2 Biomarker Analysis
• Follow the manufacturer's protocol for the specific assay system
used (HPLC or MS).
• Calibrate the equipment with appropriate standards before use.
• Pipette the CSF sample into the appropriate wells or loading vials
according to the assay instructions.
• Run the analysis according to the instrument's operating
procedure.
6.3 Quality Control
• Run control samples (negative, low, medium, and high controls)
with each batch of patient samples.
• Document all QC results in a QC log.
• Investigate and resolve any QC deviations before reporting
patient results.
6.4 Interpretation of Results
• Compare the concentrations of AD biomarkers (Amyloid-β, Tau,
and phosphorylated Tau) against established reference ranges.
• Use the instrument software to generate quantitative data.
• Verify results by cross-referencing them with QC data and
previous results, if available.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Record the analysis results in the laboratory information system
(LIS).
• Ensure all results are reviewed and verified by a qualified
technologist before release.
• Report any critical or abnormal results immediately to the
requesting clinician.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolyzed or contaminated samples may yield inaccurate
results.
• Strict adherence to specimen handling and processing protocols
is essential to avoid variability.
• Instrument calibration and maintenance are crucial for accurate
analysis.
