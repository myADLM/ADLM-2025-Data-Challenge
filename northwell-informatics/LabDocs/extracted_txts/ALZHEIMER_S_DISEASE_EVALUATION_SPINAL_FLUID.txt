Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Alzheimer’s Disease Evaluation, Spinal Fluid
1. PURPOSE
To establish a clear and standardized process for the analysis and
reporting results of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples for the
evaluation of Alzheimer’s disease in a CLIA-certified laboratory. This
SOP aims to ensure accurate, reproducible, and timely results,
maintaining the highest standards of quality and reliability.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory technologists are responsible for performing
the analysis, maintaining equipment, monitoring quality control
measures, documenting results, and taking corrective action as
needed. Supervisors are responsible for ensuring compliance with
the SOP and addressing any issues that may arise during the
process.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Collection and Handling:
Preferred/Acceptable:
• CSF obtained via lumbar puncture performed by a qualified
physician.
• Collection tubes: sterile polypropylene tubes.
• Volume: 6-10 mL of CSF, ideally divided into 3-4 aliquots.
• Maintain sample at 2-8°C if analysis will occur within 24 hours.
For delayed analysis, freeze the sample at -80°C.
Unacceptable:
• Specimens with visible blood contamination.
• Specimens collected in tubes containing preservatives or
anticoagulants.
• Specimens that have not been properly labeled or have missing
collection date/time information.
• Specimens stored at inappropriate temperatures or subjected to
repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Immunoassay analyzer for CSF biomarkers.
• ELISA kits for Beta-amyloid 1-42, Total Tau, and Phospho-Tau.
• Plate reader compatible with ELISA kits.
• Calibrators and controls specific for Beta-amyloid 1-42, Total Tau,
and Phospho-Tau.
• Micropipettes and tips.
• Refrigerated centrifuge.
• Vortex mixer.
• Sample storage freezer (-80°C).
• Computer and Laboratory Information System (LIS) for data
management.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Pre-analytical Preparation:
• Verify the identification and integrity of the CSF specimens.
Ensure proper labeling and volume.
• Allow frozen samples to thaw at 2-8°C. Avoid repeated freeze-
thaw cycles.
• Vortex the sample briefly to ensure homogeneity.
B. Calibration and Quality Control:
• Prepare calibration and control materials according to
manufacturer’s instructions.
• Run calibrators and controls at the beginning of each batch
analysis. Ensure that control results are within the acceptable
range before proceeding.
• Document all calibration and QC procedures in the appropriate
logbook.
C. Analytical Procedure:
1. Beta-amyloid 1-42, Total Tau, and Phospho-Tau Analysis:
◦ Follow the manufacturer’s protocol for the ELISA kits.
◦ Pipette the required volume of standards, controls, and CSF
samples into the appropriate wells of the ELISA plate.
◦ Add the specific conjugate and incubate the plate as
directed.
◦ Wash the plate to remove unbound material.
◦ Add the substrate and incubate for the specified time.
◦ Add the stop solution and read the optical density at the
appropriate wavelength using the plate reader.
2. Sample Analysis on Automated Analyzer:
◦ Load the samples, calibrators, and controls onto the
immunoassay analyzer.
◦ Program the analyzer with the relevant assay protocols.
◦ Initiate the run and monitor the process for any instrument
alerts or errors.
◦ Verify that instrument QC results are within acceptable limits
before validating patient results.
D. Data Analysis and Interpretation:
• Export the raw data from the plate reader or immunoassay
analyzer to the analysis software.
• Calculate the concentration of Beta-amyloid 1-42, Total Tau, and
Phospho-Tau in each sample using the calibration curves
generated from the standards.
• Compare the patient results to predetermined reference ranges
for Alzheimer’s disease evaluation.
• Any results falling outside the acceptable range or showing
significant discrepancies should prompt repeat analysis.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
Internal Quality Control:
• Perform internal QC as described in section 4B of this SOP.
• Document and review QC results before running patient samples.
If QC results are not within acceptable limits, troubleshoot and
resolve issues before proceeding.
External Quality Control:
• Participate in an external proficiency testing program for CSF
biomarkers related to Alzheimer’s disease.
• Compare results with other participating laboratories and take
corrective actions if discrepancies are identified.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
Result Verification:
• Review all results for consistency and compliance with quality
control standards.
• Document and verify results using the LIS.
Result Reporting:
• Report results according to site-specific reporting guidelines.
• Communicate critical or significantly abnormal results to the
attending physician immediately.
• Include interpretation notes if necessary, based on reference
intervals and clinical context.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Provide the laboratory’s validated reference intervals for Beta-
amyloid 1-42, Total Tau, and Phospho-Tau, which are essential for
the interpretation of results. Reference intervals should be
established based on published guidelines and validated by the
laboratory.
Example Reference Intervals:
• Beta-amyloid 1-42: > 500 pg/mL
• Total Tau: < 300 pg/mL
• Phospho-Tau: < 60 pg/mL
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the ELISA kit or immunoassay analyzer's package insert for
individual test limitations, including cross-reactivity, interferences, and
matrix effects.

• ELISA Kit Product Inserts
• Immunoassay Analyzer User Manuals
• Relevant peer-reviewed articles and guidelines on Alzheimer’s
disease biomarkers in CSF
1. APPENDIX
Include templates for log sheets, calibration curves, and any
additional forms required for documentation.

reliability of CSF biomarker testing for Alzheimer’s disease
evaluation, ultimately supporting the diagnostic and clinical
management process.
