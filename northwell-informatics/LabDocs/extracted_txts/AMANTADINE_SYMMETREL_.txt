Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical
Phase: Amantadine (Symmetrel) Analysis
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedure for the analysis
of Amantadine (Symmetrel) levels in patient specimens. This includes
steps for specimen preparation, analytical testing, documentation,
and result reporting to ensure accurate and reliable results.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel involved in testing
Amantadine levels using designated laboratory equipment and
procedures.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all designated laboratory personnel to follow
this SOP. The laboratory supervisor is responsible for ensuring
compliance with this procedure.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type:
• Preferred: Serum or plasma
• Acceptable: Whole blood collected in EDTA or heparin tubes
Volume:
• Minimum: 2 mL of serum or plasma

Equipment:
• High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) system or
Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes and tips
• Vortex mixer
• Refrigeration unit
Reagents:
• Mobile phase solution for HPLC or LC-MS/MS
• Calibrators and internal standards for Amantadine
• Quality control (QC) materials at low, medium, and high
concentrations
• Deionized water
• Methanol or Acetonitrile (HPLC grade)
Supplies:
• Collection tubes (serum or plasma tubes as appropriate)
• Sample vials
• Syringes with filters
• Gloves and lab coats
• Laboratory logbooks
6. PROCEDURE
6.1 Specimen Processing:
1. Collection and Centrifugation:
◦ Centrifuge whole blood specimens at 3,000 rpm for 10
minutes.
◦ Carefully collect the serum or plasma supernatant without
disturbing the cell layer.
2. Sample Storage:
◦ Store specimens at 2-8°C if analysis will occur within 7
days.
◦ For longer storage, freeze samples at -20°C or lower.
6.2 Calibration and Quality Control:
1. Preparation of Standards and QC Samples:
◦ Prepare standard solutions of Amantadine in appropriate
matrix (serum/plasma) at varying concentrations.
◦ Prepare QC samples at low, medium, and high levels.
2. System Calibration:
◦ Calibrate the HPLC or LC-MS/MS system using the
prepared standards per manufacturer instructions.
3. Quality Control:
◦ Run QC samples along with patient specimens to verify the
accuracy and precision of the assay.
6.3 Analytical Testing:
1. Sample Preparation:
◦ Thaw frozen samples at room temperature.
◦ Vortex all samples for 30 seconds.
◦ Filter samples using syringes with filters to remove any
particulate matter.
2. Sample Analysis:
◦ Set up the HPLC or LC-MS/MS system with the appropriate
parameters for Amantadine analysis.
◦ Inject patient samples, calibrators, and QC samples into the
system.
◦ Run the samples and ensure chromatographic conditions
are adhered to.
6.4 Documentation and Recording:
1. Result Interpretation:
◦ Analyze the chromatograms and mass spectra to quantify
Amantadine levels in patient samples.
◦ Compare results against calibration standards to ensure
accuracy.
2. Documentation:
◦ Document the results in the laboratory logbook.
◦ Ensure records include sample identification, analysis date,
technician initials, calibration and QC data.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Results are automatically processed and reviewed by the LIS
(Laboratory Information System).
2. All results must be verified by the analyzing technologist before
release.
3. Critical or abnormal results should be immediately
communicated to the appropriate healthcare provider.
8. QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE
• Ensure the use of certified reference materials for calibration.
• Run QC samples during each analytical batch.
• Equipment validation and maintenance logs must be kept up-to-
date.
• Address any deviations or non-conformities immediately and
report to a supervisor for corrective action.
