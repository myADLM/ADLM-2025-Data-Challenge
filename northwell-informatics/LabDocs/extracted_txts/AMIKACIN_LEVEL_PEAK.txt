Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Title: Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for AMIKACIN LEVEL, PEAK
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the procedure for the analysis of AMIKACIN
LEVEL, PEAK, ensuring accuracy and reliability of patient results.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for
performing the procedure as described, documenting the results, and
reporting any discrepancies or issues to a supervisor.
1. DEFINITION
AMIKACIN LEVEL, PEAK refers to the quantitative measurement of
amikacin concentration in the patient's serum or plasma, typically
taken 30 minutes after an intravenous dose to ensure appropriate
drug levels for therapeutic efficacy and to minimize toxicity.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen:
1. Preferred/acceptable:
◦ Serum or plasma collected in a red-top tube (serum) or
green-top lithium heparin tube (plasma).
◦ Collection should be timed such that the specimen is drawn
approximately 30 minutes after an intravenous dose.
2. Unacceptable:
◦ Specimens collected outside the appropriate time frame.
◦ Hemolyzed samples.
◦ Specimens collected in tubes other than specified (e.g.,
EDTA, citrate) that could interfere with the assay.
B. Equipment and Supplies:
• Automated Immunoassay Analyzer (e.g., Architect i1000SR)
• Amikacin reagent kits
• Calibrators and Controls
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Centrifuge
• Timer
C. Quality Control:
• Perform quality control each day the test is run using at least two
levels of control material (low and high).
• Ensure that controls fall within the acceptable range provided with
the reagent kits before proceeding with patient samples.
• Document quality control results in the appropriate log.
D. Analytical Procedure:
1. Sample Preparation:
◦ Allow serum/plasma samples to clot and centrifuge if
necessary, following standard laboratory procedures.
◦ Pipette the required volume of serum/plasma into the
designated sample cups for the immunoassay analyzer.
2. Calibration and Analyzer Setup:
◦ Follow the manufacturer's instructions for setting up the
automated analyzer and calibrating it with the provided
calibrators.
◦ Ensure that the instrument is correctly calibrated before
running patient samples.
3. Running Patient Samples:
◦ Load the prepared sample cups into the sample rack of the
analyzer.
◦ Initiate the run according to the analyzer’s operating
manual, ensuring that samples are analyzed with
appropriate test settings for amikacin.
◦ Monitor the run for any error messages or discrepancies.
4. Documentation and Verification:
◦ Verify the completion of the run and review the raw data.
◦ Compare patient results to the reference range for peak
amikacin levels (20-30 µg/mL).
◦ Document results in the laboratory information system (LIS).
E. Troubleshooting:
• If results fall outside expected control limits, recalibrate the
analyzer, and re-run the controls before testing patient samples.
• If the sample results are questionable (e.g., significantly higher or
lower than expected), re-examine the sample for integrity issues,
and consider re-running the sample.
• Report persistent instrument errors to the supervisor and contact
technical support if necessary.
1. REPORTING RESULTS:
◦ Transmit the verified results from the analyzer to the LIS.
◦ Ensure results are documented and flagged if they fall within
critical limits (notify the attending physician if the peak levels
exceed 35 µg/mL).
◦ Critical results (both low and high) should be flagged and
promptly communicated to the relevant medical personnel
as per laboratory policy.
2. REFERENCES:
◦ Analyzer manufacturer’s operator manual.
◦ Amikacin reagent kit package insert.
◦ Relevant internal laboratory quality control policies.
3. REFERENCE INTERVALS:
◦ Peak therapeutic range: 20-30 µg/mL
◦ Toxic range: Levels >35 µg/mL
By following this SOP, laboratory personnel ensure that accurate,
reliable, and timely results are generated for AMIKACIN LEVEL,
PEAK, contributing to appropriate patient care and medication
management.
