Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for AMIKACIN LEVEL, RANDOM
1. PURPOSE
This document provides standard procedures for measuring Amikacin
levels in a random serum sample to ensure accurate and reliable
results. Amikacin levels are crucial for monitoring therapeutic drug
levels in patients to ensure efficacy and avoid toxicity.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
All laboratory personnel performing the Amikacin level assays are
responsible for following this protocol. Supervisors are responsible
for ensuring that all staff are properly trained, the equipment is
functioning correctly, and the procedures are being followed as
outlined.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Acceptable:
• Serum collected in a plain red-top tube or serum separator tube
(SST).
• Collected specimens should be transported to the laboratory
immediately.
• Samples should be received in the laboratory within 2 hours of
collection. If not analyzed immediately, refrigerate at 2-8°C and
analyze within 24 hours.
Unacceptable:
• Specimens collected in sodium citrate, sodium fluoride, potassium
oxalate, or EDTA tubes.
• Specimens that are grossly hemolyzed or lipemic.
• Specimens left at room temperature for more than 2 hours.
4. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
Equipment:
• Centrifuge
• Refrigerated storage (2-8°C)
• Analytical balance
• Pipettes and tips
• Amikacin reagent kit
• Analyzer capable of performing immunoassay (e.g., enzyme-
linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA] system or automated
immunoassay analyzer).
Reagents:
• Amikacin standards and controls
• Amikacin antibody reagent
• Wash buffer
• Substrate solution
• Stop solution
5. PROCEDURE
A. Pre-Analytical Phase:
1. Specimen Preparation:
◦ Ensure that specimen tubes are correctly labeled with
patient information.
◦ Centrifuge blood samples at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes to
obtain serum.
◦ Transfer serum to a clean labeled aliquot tube.
2. Quality Control Samples:
◦ Prepare quality control (QC) samples according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Use QC samples to check the
accuracy and precision of the assay.
B. Analytical Phase:
1. Reagent Preparation:
◦ Prepare reagents according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
◦ Allow all reagents to reach room temperature before use.
2. Assay Setup:
◦ Set up the ELISA system or automated immunoassay
analyzer as per the manufacturer’s guidelines.
◦ Load the prepared reagents, standards, controls, and
patient samples onto the analyzer.
3. Assay Procedure:
◦ Add specified volumes of standards, controls, and patient
samples to appropriate wells or designated sample sites on
the analyzer.
◦ Add the Amikacin antibody reagent and allow reaction to
occur as specified in the assay kit instructions.
◦ Wash the reaction wells thoroughly to remove unbound
reagents.
◦ Add substrate solution and incubate for the recommended
period.
◦ Add stop solution to halt the reaction.
◦ Measure the absorbance or fluorescence in the reaction
wells.
4. Internal Quality Control:
◦ At the beginning of each run, analyze the QC samples along
with patient samples.
◦ Verify that QC results are within acceptable ranges before
proceeding with patient sample analysis. If QC results are
out of range, troubleshoot and rectify issues before
analyzing patient samples.
C. Post-Analytical Phase:
1. Calculations:
◦ The analyzer will automatically calculate the concentration
of Amikacin in each patient sample based on the standard
curve.
2. Result Review:
◦ Review and verify the results generated by the analyzer.
◦ Ensure that all results are within the assay's reportable
range.
◦ If results fall outside the acceptable ranges, recheck the
sample to confirm accuracy.
3. Reporting Results:
◦ Results are automatically transmitted to the Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
◦ Verify the results in LIS before officially releasing them.
◦ Alert the physician or healthcare provider if results indicate
toxic levels of Amikacin.
6. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the manufacturer’s insert for limitations specific to the
Amikacin assay being used. Possible limitations include but are not
limited to:
• Interference from substances such as lipids, hemolysis, and
bilirubin.
• Cross-reactivity with other aminoglycosides.
7. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions for the Amikacin assay kit.
• Laboratory’s internal quality control policy documents.
8. MODIFICATIONS
This SOP may be revised as new information or methodologies
become available. Revisions must go through approval by the
laboratory director.
This protocol ensures consistent and accurate determination of
Amikacin levels in serum samples, adhering to CLIA standards and
maintaining reliable patient care.
