Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Title: Generation of Results for
Amikacin Level (Trough, Random, or Peak)
1. PURPOSE To provide clear guidelines for the analytical phase
of generating results for amikacin levels (trough, random, or
peak) in patient samples. This SOP ensures accurate and
reliable results are reported promptly.
Responsibility: It is the responsibility of designated laboratory staff to
conduct the analysis accurately and document the process in
accordance with this procedure. All staff are responsible for
identifying and reporting any issues that may affect the test results.
1. DEFINITION Amikacin levels are determined to monitor
therapeutic drug concentrations in patients. These
measurements help in assessing the drug's efficacy and toxicity
to ensure safe and effective patient care.
2. PRECAUTIONS • Ensure all specimens are appropriately
accessioned and labelled. • Handle all specimens with care and
use proper PPE (Personal Protective Equipment) to prevent
contamination and exposure. • Calibration and maintenance of
equipment must be kept up-to-date as per manufacturer’s
guidelines.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS • Preferred/acceptable: Blood
samples collected in red-top tubes, serum or plasma. •
Unacceptable: Samples collected in tubes containing
anticoagulants that may interfere with the assay.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES • Automated
analyzer optimized for therapeutic drug level testing (e.g.,
Roche Cobas, Abbott ARCHITECT) • Amikacin reagent kit as
specified by instrument manufacturer • Control solutions for
quality control • Calibrators as per manufacturer guidelines •
Standard laboratory supplies: centrifuge, pipettes, sample cups,
PPE
5. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation:
1. Ensure the analyzer is calibrated according to manufacturer
instructions with quality control results within acceptable
ranges.
2. Confirm reagent kits are within expiry date and stored as per
manufacturer’s recommendations.
B) Sample Processing:
1. Centrifuge the collected blood samples if required to separate
serum or plasma.
2. Label and load samples into the analyzer as indicated.
3. For trough level: conduct the analysis close to the time the next
dose is due, typically 30 minutes before.
4. For peak level: conduct the analysis 30 minutes after infusion
completion.
5. For random level: conduct the analysis as per clinician's
specific request.
C) Analysis:
1. Initiate the analysis as per instrument guidelines.
2. Use appropriate calibrators and controls to validate the
analytical process.
3. Document processing details: including date, time of analysis,
technologist initials, and any deviations form normal procedure.
D) Quality Control:
1. Perform quality control checks with control solutions at different
levels as indicated by the manufacturer.
2. Document and review QC results to ensure accuracy.
3. In the case of QC failure, notify supervisor, and troubleshoot as
per guidelines before proceeding with patient samples.
E) Result Generation and Reporting:
1. Review the generated results for consistency.
2. Verify results against reference intervals:
◦ Trough level: <5 to 10 mcg/mL
◦ Peak level: 15 to 30 mcg/mL
◦ Random: no specific interval, clinician-specified use.
3. Document any critical values immediately and follow the lab
protocol for notification.
4. Enter verified results into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS) and ensure proper documentation.
F) Documentation:
1. Ensure all logs (temperature, QC results, calibration, sample
processing details) are accurately maintained.
2. Record any issues, deviations from SOP, and corrective actions
taken.
3. REFERENCES • Instrument Manufacturer Guidelines for
Amikacin reagent kit usage. • Clinical Laboratory Standards
Institute (CLSI) Guidelines. • Relevant medical and
pharmacology texts for reference intervals and interpretation.
4. REVIEW AND REVISIONS This SOP will be reviewed annually
or as needed by the Quality Control Supervisor. Revisions will
be documented and communicated to all laboratory personnel.
