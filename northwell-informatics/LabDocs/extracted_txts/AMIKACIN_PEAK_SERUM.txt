Standard Operating Procedures (SOP): Analytical Phase for
Generating Results for AMIKACIN, PEAK, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to outline the steps and
responsibilities for the accurate and precise analytical measurement
of Amikacin in serum samples. This document ensures that all staff
properly perform their duties, maintain quality control, and generate
reliable results for clinical interpretation.
1. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel involved in the analytical
testing of Amikacin in serum samples using the designated analytical
methodologies.
1. RESPONSIBILITIES
All laboratory technicians and scientists performing the Amikacin
serum assays must follow this protocol to ensure consistency and
reliability of the results. Supervisors must ensure compliance, review
results, and address any issues related to the assay.
1. EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS
• Analytical Instrument: HPLC or appropriate immunoassay
analyzer
• Reagents: Amikacin reagent kits compatible with the instrument
• Controls: Low, medium, and high concentration quality controls
• Calibrators: A series of known concentration calibrators
• Pipettes and tips
• Serum sample tubes
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred Specimen: 1.0 mL serum, peak levels typically collected
30 minutes after intravenous administration of Amikacin.
• Specimen Stability: Serum should be separated from cells within
2 hours of collection and can be stored at 2-8°C for up to 48
hours. For long term storage, freeze samples at -20°C or below.
• Unacceptable Specimens: Hemolyzed samples or samples with
insufficient volume.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation
1. Upon receiving the serum samples, ensure each is properly
labeled and matches the corresponding test request.
2. Inspect samples for hemolysis or other integrity issues. Reject
and document unacceptable samples.
3. Aliquot 1.0 mL of serum into a clean tube for analysis.
B. Instrument Preparation
1. Perform instrument maintenance and calibration according to
the manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Run calibrators to establish a standard curve for Amikacin.
3. Ensure all reagents and consumables are within their expiration
dates and properly stored.
C. Assay Procedure
1. Program the instrument with the appropriate method for
Amikacin analysis, specifying sample and calibrator positions.
2. Load serum samples, controls, and calibrators onto the
instrument according to the programmed sequence.
3. Start the assay run and monitor the instrument for any error
messages.
D. Quality Control
1. Run quality control samples at low, medium, and high
concentrations with each batch of patient samples.
2. Review QC results to ensure they are within acceptable ranges.
3. If QC results fail, troubleshoot the issue, re-run the QC, and
document the corrective actions.
4. RESULTS AND INTERPRETATION
• Review instrument-generated data for each sample.
• Compare the results with the established calibration curve to
determine sample concentrations.
• Assess the results for each quality control sample to ensure
assay accuracy.
• If all controls are within the acceptable range, verify and approve
the patient results for release.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Enter verified results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
if not automatically transmitted.
• Ensure results are reported in accordance with lab protocols and
are accessible to the requesting clinician.
• Note any results that fall outside the therapeutic or critical ranges
following the notification protocol.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Therapeutic Range for Amikacin Peak (serum):
• Typically, 20-30 µg/mL (confirm with current clinical guidelines).
1. QUALITY ASSURANCE
• Regularly participate in proficiency testing programs to ensure
compliance with regulatory standards.
• Regularly review SOPs and update them as needed based on
new clinical evidence or instrument updates.
• Maintain records of all maintenance, calibrations, and quality
control results for auditing purposes.
1. LIMITATIONS
• Ensure samples are handled properly to prevent degradation.
• Recognize potential interferences in the assay from other
medications or patient conditions.

• Package inserts and operation manuals for the analytical
instruments and reagents.
• Current clinical practice guidelines for Amikacin therapeutic drug
monitoring.
