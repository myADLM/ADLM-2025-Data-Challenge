Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Title: Analytical Phase Protocol
for Generating Amikacin Results, Random, Serum
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the steps involved in the
analytical phase for generating amikacin results in a random serum
sample. This ensures consistent, accurate, and reliable results
necessary for effective patient care.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory staff and technologists are responsible for
following this SOP meticulously, documenting all required
information, and performing any necessary corrective actions to
ensure accurate results.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Preferred Specimen:
• 1 mL random serum sample collected in a red-top vacutainer or
with SST (serum separation tube).
• Samples should be transported to the lab as soon as possible.
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Specimens collected in anticoagulant tubes.
• Grossly hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
• Samples that have been stored for prolonged periods.
Specimen Stability:
• Serum specimens should be kept at 2-8°C if they cannot be
processed immediately.
• Specimens must be analyzed within 24 hours of collection if
refrigerated.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Automated chemistry analyzer or HPLC system as validated for
amikacin testing.
• Centrifuge
Reagents:
• Amikacin reagent kits specific to the analyzer.
• Control solutions (high, low, and normal levels) for amikacin.
Supplies:
• Pipettes and tips
• Appropriate lab-ware (e.g., test tubes, sample cups)
• PPE (personal protective equipment)
1. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
• Wear appropriate PPE (lab coat, gloves, eye protection)
• Ensure all equipment is calibrated and maintained per the
manufacturer’s instructions.
• Verify the integrity of reagents and ensure they are within the
expiration date.
Sample Processing:
• Centrifuge serum samples at 2000-3000 RPM for at least 10
minutes to ensure clear separation.
• Transfer serum aliquots to designated sample cups for analysis.
Controls and Calibration:
• Run amikacin controls (high, low, and normal) at the beginning of
each batch to ensure valid results.
• Calibrate the analyzer as per the manufacturer's instructions
using calibration standards.
Running the Samples:
• Load the serum samples into the automated chemistry analyzer
or HPLC system.
• Select and verify the assay method for amikacin.
• Initiate the analysis, ensuring the correct sample identification and
run parameters.
Result Interpretation:
• Review all data for quality control compliance.
• Evaluate controls for acceptable ranges before validating patient
results.
• If controls fall outside acceptable limits, troubleshoot and rerun
controls and patient samples.
Documentation:
• Record all results, including patient identifiers, run date, and
analyst initials, in the lab information system (LIS).
• Document any corrective actions taken for out-of-range results.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
Internal Quality Control:
• Perform quality control checks with each run using designated
control solutions.
• Document all control results in the qc logbook and investigate any
deviations.
Result Reporting:
• Results are automatically transmitted to the LIS.
• Ensure all results are reviewed by the technologist and verified
before releasing to clinicians.
Criteria for Rejection:
• Hemolyzed samples resulting in inaccurate amikacin levels.
• Samples not meeting stability requirements.
• Unacceptable specimen types.
Corrective Actions:
• Recollect, reprocess, and reanalyze samples failing to meet
acceptance criteria.
• Troubleshoot equipment malfunctions through recalibration or
maintenance.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the specific product insert for the amikacin reagent kit for
any limitations related to the assay, such as interferences from other
medications or conditions affecting amikacin testing.

• Manufacturer’s instructions and calibration guidelines for the
automated chemistry analyzer or HPLC system used.
• Insert from the amikacin reagent kit.
• Laboratory quality assurance protocols.
1. PROCEDURE REVIEW
This SOP will be reviewed annually by the laboratory supervisor and
updated as needed to ensure compliance with current best practices
and regulatory requirements.
By adhering to this SOP, laboratory personnel will generate accurate,
timely, and reliable amikacin results for patient care.
