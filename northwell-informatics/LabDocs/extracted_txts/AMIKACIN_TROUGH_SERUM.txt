1. PURPOSE
This protocol provides standardized procedures for the analysis and
reporting of Amikacin trough levels in serum to ensure accurate and
reliable patient results.
2. DEFINITION
Amikacin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic used to treat severe
bacterial infections. The trough level refers to the lowest
concentration of drug in the patient's bloodstream, typically measured
just before the next dose.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Equipment:
◦ Chemistry analyzer capable of performing immunoassay or
chromatographic techniques
◦ Centrifuge
◦ Pipettes and pipette tips
◦ Sample tubes (serum separator tubes preferable)
◦ Calibrators and controls specific to Amikacin assay
• Reagents:
◦ Amikacin reagent kit
◦ Quality control materials (high, medium, and low level)
◦ Calibrators
• Supplies:
◦ Gloves
◦ Laboratory bench coat
◦ Biohazard disposal containers
◦ Patient identification labels
4. PROCEDURE
4.1 Sample Preparation:
1. Verify that all serum specimens have been properly collected
and labeled.
2. Centrifuge blood samples at 3000 RPM for 10 minutes to
separate serum.
3. Transfer the serum to a clean, appropriately labeled tube if
needed.
4. Ensure specimens are stored at 2-8°C if not analyzed
immediately and process within 24 hours of collection.
4.2 Calibration and Quality Controls:
1. Calibrate the analyzer according to the manufacturer’s
instructions using the Amikacin calibrators.
2. Run quality control materials at the start of each shift and with
each new assay lot. Record and evaluate the results of control
materials before patient sample analysis. Ensure that quality
control results are within the established acceptable ranges.
Take corrective actions if controls are out of range as per the
laboratory's standard procedures.
4.3 Amikacin Assay:
1. Load the prepared serum samples, calibrators, and controls
onto the analyzer in the designated sample positions.
2. Follow the specific assay instructions by the reagent
manufacturer for the Amikacin test.
3. Start the analysis run.
4.4 Results and Interpretation:
1. Upon completion of the assay run, review the results of patient
samples along with calibrator and quality control readings.
2. Ensure that the quality control results are within the acceptable
limits before verifying patient results.
3. Interpret the Amikacin trough levels against established
reference ranges (typically 5-10 mg/L, but refer to specific
protocol guidelines).
4.5 Reporting:
1. Document the results in the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
2. Include any relevant clinical comments or interpretations based
on the results.
3. If a critical value is detected (e.g., <1 mg/L or >15 mg/L
depending on lab-established critical limits), follow the
laboratory’s procedure for reporting critical values to the
appropriate healthcare provider immediately.
5. TROUBLESHOOTING
1. If calibration or quality control fails, repeat the procedure after
ensuring all reagents and equipment are functioning properly.
Consult the manufacturer’s troubleshooting guide for specific
issues.
2. If assay issues persist, consult with a supervisor or contact the
reagent manufacturer for further assistance.
6. QUALITY ASSURANCE
1. Regularly participate in external proficiency testing for Amikacin
assays.
2. Conduct periodic equipment maintenance and performance
checks as recommended by the analyzer manufacturer.
3. Review and update this protocol annually or as needed to
ensure compliance with regulatory standards and manufacturer
guidelines.
