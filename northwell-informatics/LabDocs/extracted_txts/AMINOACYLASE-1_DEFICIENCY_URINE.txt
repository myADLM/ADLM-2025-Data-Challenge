Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Aminoacylase-1 Deficiency, Urine
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this SOP is to provide detailed
instructions for the accurate and reliable analytical processing
of urine samples to detect Aminoacylase-1 Deficiency. This
disorder is characterized by the excretion of N-acetylated amino
acids, which can be quantified via specialized urine testing. This
procedure outlines the steps involved in preparing, analyzing,
and reporting results for urine samples suspected of containing
biomarkers for Aminoacylase-1 Deficiency
Responsibility: It is the responsibility of designated laboratory
personnel to follow this protocol and ensure accurate processing and
reporting of the test results.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen: Preferred/acceptable: - 10 mL of clean-catch, midstream
urine collected in a sterile container. Ensure the specimen is
collected within 4 hours of analysis. - Specimens can be stored
immediately at 4-8°C if there is a delay in testing, for up to 24 hours.
Unacceptable:
- Specimens arriving in the laboratory more than 24 hours after collection.
- Specimens with contamination or insufficient volume (< 10 mL).
- Samples without proper labeling (collection date and time).
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES A. High-
performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system B. Mass
spectrometry (MS) detector C. Specific standards and controls
for N-acetylated amino acids D. Mobile phase reagents (e.g.,
methanol, water, acetonitrile) E. Proper disposal containers for
biological and chemical waste F. Sterile, labeled collection
containers G. Computer system with analytical software to
interpret results
2. PROCEDURE
Sample Preparation: 1. Ensure urine sample is at room temperature
before proceeding. 2. Aliquot 5 mL of urine into the labeled centrifuge
tube. 3. Centrifuge the tube at 1,500 rpm for 5 minutes to sediment
any cellular debris. 4. Carefully transfer supernatant (urine) to a new
clean tube, avoiding disturbance of the sediment.
Analytical Procedure: 1. Prepare HPLC system according to
manufacturer instructions. Ensure that all reagents and mobile
phases are properly prepared and degassed. 2. Set up MS detector
and calibration curves using standards for N-acetylated amino acids.
3. Inject urine sample into the HPLC system. 4. Perform the
chromatographic separation using specified conditions (e.g., column
type, flow rate). 5. Detect and quantify N-acetylated amino acids
using MS detector. 6. Record results and validate peaks
corresponding to key biomarkers for Aminoacylase-1 Deficiency.
Quality Control: 1. Include quality control samples with each batch of
patient specimens analyzed. 2. Verify that all controls fall within
acceptable limits before proceeding with patient samples. 3.
Document corrective actions taken if any control falls outside of
acceptable limits.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Interpret results based on identified peaks within the
chromatogram.
2. Compare findings with established reference intervals for
N-acetylated amino acids.
3. Any deviations from normal reference ranges should be
flagged for further clinical evaluation.
4. Results should be verified and electronically transmitted
to the LIS.
5. Unusual findings should be reviewed by a qualified
professional prior to result release.
2. REFERENCE INTERVALS Reference intervals for N-acetylated
amino acids should be provided by the specific assay
manufacturer. Differences in patient age, gender, and health
status may be considered when interpreting results.
3. METHOD LIMITATIONS
◦ Ensure appropriate sample collection and storage
conditions to avoid degradation of metabolites.
◦ Proper calibration of equipment must be maintained for
accurate quantification.
◦ Any interference or anomalies noted should be documented
and reviewed.
