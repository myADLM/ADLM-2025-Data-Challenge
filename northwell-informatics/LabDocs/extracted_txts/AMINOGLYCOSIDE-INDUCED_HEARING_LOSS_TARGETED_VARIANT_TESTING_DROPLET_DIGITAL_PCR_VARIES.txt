Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for AMINOGLYCOSIDE-INDUCED HEARING
LOSS, TARGETED VARIANT TESTING using DROPLET DIGITAL
PCR
1. PURPOSE
• This SOP describes the procedure for generating results for
aminoglycoside-induced hearing loss targeted variant testing
using Droplet Digital PCR (ddPCR). It ensures consistency,
reliability, and accurate mutation detection in specified genes
associated with aminoglycoside-induced hearing loss.
2. SCOPE
• This protocol applies to all laboratory technologists trained in
ddPCR and authorized to perform genetic testing for
aminoglycoside-induced hearing loss.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• It is the responsibility of designated laboratory staff to perform the
testing procedure, ensure equipment functionality, document the
procedures accurately, and report results with diligence.
• It is the responsibility of the supervisor to review results, validate
processes, and undertake corrective actions if required.
4. DEFINITIONS
• Targeted Variant Testing: Focusing on a specific gene locus
associated with aminoglycoside-induced hearing loss.
• Droplet Digital PCR (ddPCR): A highly sensitive technique for
quantifying DNA, particularly useful for detecting low-frequency
mutations.
5. EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS
• ddPCR system (QX200 Droplet Digital PCR System or
equivalent)
• Droplet generation oil and droplet reader
• PCR machine
• Pipettes and tips
• Plate sealer
• Nuclease-free water
• DNA extraction kit
• MasterMix for ddPCR
• Primers and probes specific to the targeted genetic variant
• 96-well plates
• Positive and negative control DNA samples
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
6. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation of Reagents and Samples:
1. Specimen DNA Extraction:
◦ Extract genomic DNA from patient samples using an
approved extraction kit following the manufacturer’s
protocol.
2. Quantify and Assess DNA Quality:
◦ Measure DNA concentration using a spectrophotometer or a
fluorometer. Ensure DNA purity (A260/A280 ratio) is
between 1.8-2.0.
B) Setting Up ddPCR Reaction:
1. Prepare ddPCR Mix:
◦ For each reaction well, prepare the following mix:
▪ Droplet generation oil: as per manufacturer’s
recommendation.
▪ MasterMix: as per manufacturer’s instructions.
▪ Primers and probes for the targeted variant: at optimal
concentrations specified in the protocol.
▪ Up to 2 µL of purified DNA sample (final volume to be as
per the ddPCR protocol).
▪ Nuclease-free water to complete the total reaction
volume.
2. Generate Droplets:
◦ Load the reaction mixture into a droplet generation cartridge
following the equipment manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Generate droplets using the droplet generator.
3. PCR Amplification:
◦ Transfer generated droplets to a 96-well PCR plate.
◦ Seal the plate using a plate sealer.
◦ Perform PCR amplification in a thermocycler under the
conditions specified for the ddPCR master mix being used
(typically involves an initial denaturation step, followed by 40
cycles of denaturation, annealing/extension, and a final
extension).
C) Droplet Reading and Analysis:
1. Droplet Reading:
◦ Load the PCR plate into the droplet reader.
◦ Run the droplet reading cycle as per the manufacturer's
instructions.
2. Data Analysis:
◦ Utilize software provided with the ddPCR system to analyze
the fluorescence data.
◦ Assign positive and negative droplets to compute the
concentration of target variants.
◦ Validate results using positive and negative controls.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Positive Control:
◦ A known DNA sample containing the targeted genetic
variant is included to ensure the assay's sensitivity and
specificity.
2. Negative Control:
◦ A no-target control (nuclease-free water) is included to
check for contamination.
3. Repeat Testing:
◦ Any sample yielding ambiguous results is retested.
◦ Cross-validation with an alternative method may be
performed if necessary.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Data Compilation:
◦ Results are compiled, reviewed, and verified by a laboratory
technologist before final reporting.
2. Result Interpretation:
◦ The presence or absence of the targeted genetic variant is
interpreted based on the threshold set in the protocol.
◦ Report results including any necessary annotations
regarding the controls and quality of the DNA sample.
3. Documentation:
◦ Ensure all results are duly documented in the Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
◦ Maintain an electronic and paper record of the assay setup,
raw data, and analyzed results.
