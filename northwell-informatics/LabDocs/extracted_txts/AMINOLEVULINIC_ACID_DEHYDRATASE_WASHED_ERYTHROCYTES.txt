Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Generating Results for
Aminolevulinic Acid Dehydratase (ALAD), Washed Erythrocytes
1. PURPOSE
This protocol outlines the steps for the accurate measurement and
generation of results for Aminolevulinic Acid Dehydratase (ALAD)
activity in washed erythrocytes. This assay is crucial for diagnosing
lead poisoning and other disorders affecting heme synthesis.
Responsibility: Designated staff are responsible for performing and
documenting the assay according to this procedure. It is the
responsibility of all staff to adhere to the protocol and report any
issues affecting the assay performance to a supervisor.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Acceptable Specimens:
◦ Whole blood collected in heparinized tubes (green top) or
acid-citrate-dextrose (ACD) tubes.
◦ Specimens must not exceed 48 hours from collection to
analysis.
◦ Specimens should be kept refrigerated (2-8°C) but brought
to room temperature (20-25°C) before proceeding with the
assay.
Unacceptable Specimens:
◦ Specimens older than 48 hours.
◦ Specimens showing signs of hemolysis or clotting.
◦ Specimens collected in tubes other than heparinized or ACD
tubes.
2. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
◦ ALAD assay kit
◦ Reagent grade water
◦ Wash buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4)
◦ Hemolysis reagent
◦ Calibration standards and controls
◦ Microcentrifuge tubes
◦ Pipettes and tips
◦ Microcentrifuge
◦ Plate reader or spectrophotometer (specific for ALAD
measurement wavelengths)
3. PROCEDURE
4.1 Preparation of Washed Erythrocytes: - Centrifuge the whole
blood at 2,000 x g for 10 minutes at room temperature. -
Carefully remove the plasma and buffy coat without disturbing
the erythrocytes. - Wash the erythrocytes three times with
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), centrifuging at 2,000 x g each
time. - After the final wash, resuspend the erythrocytes in a
small volume of PBS.
4.2 Hemolysis: - Add an appropriate volume of hemolysis
reagent to the washed erythrocytes (refer to the assay kit
instructions). - Mix gently and incubate at room temperature for
10-15 minutes. - Centrifuge at 10,000 x g for 5 minutes to
remove cellular debris. - Transfer the supernatant containing
the hemolysate to a fresh microcentrifuge tube.
4.3 Performing the ALAD Activity Assay: - Set up the microplate
reader or spectrophotometer according to the manufacturer's
instructions for ALAD activity measurement. - Prepare
calibration standards and controls according to the kit
instructions. - Pipette the standards, controls, and hemolysate
samples into appropriate wells or cuvettes. - Add reagent
specific for the ALAD assay to each well. - Incubate for the time
specified in the assay kit instructions (typically 30-60 minutes). -
Stop the reaction (if specified in the kit instructions). - Measure
the absorbance at the appropriate wavelength for the ALAD
activity using the plate reader or spectrophotometer.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Run quality control samples with each assay to ensure
accuracy and reliability of the results.
◦ Acceptable ranges for quality control samples should be
within the limits provided by the kit manufacturer.
◦ Document all quality control results and take corrective
actions if the results fall outside the acceptable range.
5. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ Calculations should be made according to the formula
provided in the assay kit instructions.
◦ Results are to be documented and reviewed before
reporting.
◦ Report critical values to the appropriate healthcare provider
following laboratory guidelines on critical result reporting.
◦ Ensure that all results are entered into the Laboratory
Information System (LIS) accurately for review and
verification.

◦ ALAD assay kit instructions
◦ Laboratory policies on specimen handling, quality control,
critical result reporting, and LIS documentation.
7. METHOD LIMITATIONS
◦ Specimen integrity: Ensure specimens are properly
collected and stored to prevent degradation.
◦ Interference: Hemolysis or improper sample handling can
affect the assay performance.
8. TROUBLESHOOTING
◦ If the assay fails to produce valid results, review the
procedure for specimen handling, reagent preparation, and
assay setup.
◦ Verify that the instrument settings (e.g., incubation times,
wavelengths) conform to assay kit instructions.
◦ Consult the kit manufacturer’s instructions for additional
troubleshooting steps.
Staff shall seek guidance from the supervisor or on-call
specialist should any issues persist.
