Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for the analysis of Aminolevulinic Acid
Dehydratase (ALAD) activity in whole blood, ensuring accurate and
reliable results as per the laboratory standards and quality assurance
protocols.
Responsibility: It is the responsibility of all trained laboratory
personnel to follow this SOP accurately and report any deviations to
the supervisor immediately. The supervisors are responsible for
ensuring that the SOP is followed and for addressing any issues that
might arise during the process.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Spectrophotometer
• Microcentrifuge
• Pipettes and tips
• Eppendorf tubes
• Test tubes
• Reagent kit specific for ALAD activity
• Whole blood samples
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
• Temperature controlled storage (fridge/freezer)
1. DEFINITIONS
ALAD: Aminolevulinic Acid Dehydratase, an enzyme involved in the
heme synthesis pathway that can be inhibited by lead.
1. PROCEDURE
A) Sample Preparation:
1. Confirm that the whole blood samples are collected in EDTA
tubes and received within an appropriate time frame (≤48
hours) from collection. Samples should be kept refrigerated at
2-8°C until analysis.
2. Ensure that all reagents are stored according to the
manufacturer's recommendations and are within their expiry
dates.
3. Thaw any frozen reagents at room temperature and mix
thoroughly before use. Similarly, bring refrigerated reagents to
room temperature before use.
B) Reagent Preparation:
1. Prepare all necessary reagents and solutions as per the
manufacturer’s instructions in the reagent kit. These might
include substrate solution, buffer solution, and stop solution.
2. Label all tubes and reagents accurately to avoid any mix-ups.
C) ALAD Enzyme Assay:
1. Pipette a specific volume (e.g., 50 µL) of whole blood into pre-
labeled test tubes or wells of a microplate.
2. Add the substrate solution to each sample according to the
reagent kit’s protocol.
3. Incubate the mixture at 37°C for a time specified in the reagent
kit instructions (typically around 1 hour).
4. After incubation, add the stop solution to terminate the reaction.
5. Centrifuge the samples at 2000 rpm for 10 minutes to
precipitate any debris.
6. Transfer the supernatant to a clean microplate or
spectrophotometer cuvette.
D) Measurement and Calculation:
1. Measure the absorbance of each sample at the wavelength
specified by the reagent kit using the spectrophotometer.
2. Record the absorbance values and calculate the ALAD activity
according to the formula provided by the reagent kit. This
usually involves comparison to a standard curve pre-
established using standard solutions of known concentrations.
3. Include appropriate controls (negative and positive) to validate
the assay results.
4. Cross verify the results by repeating the assay for outliers or
unexpected findings to ensure reproducibility.
E) Quality Control:
1. Perform quality control assays alongside patient samples using
control samples with known ALAD activity levels to ensure the
accuracy and precision of the assay.
2. Document all QC results and take appropriate corrective
actions if the QC results fall outside the acceptable range.
3. Record the date, time, and initials of the technologist
performing the assay in the laboratory logbook.
4. REPORTING RESULTS
5. Enter the results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
and review the generated report for any discrepancies.
6. Verify that all controls fell within acceptable ranges before
signing out patient results.
7. Critical results must be communicated to the clinician
immediately, adhering to the laboratory critical results policy.
