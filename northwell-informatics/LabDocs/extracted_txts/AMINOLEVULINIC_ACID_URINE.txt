Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Urine Aminolevulinic
Acid Analysis
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for the quantitative determination of
aminolevulinic acid (ALA) in urine, ensuring accurate and reliable
results essential for diagnostic and therapeutic decisions.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory staff will perform the analysis of ALA in urine
samples following the procedure below. All staff are responsible for
maintaining the integrity of the process and identifying any
deficiencies that may impact the test results, reporting them to the
supervisor.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/acceptable:
• 10 mL of freshly voided urine, collected in a sterile container
without preservatives.
Unacceptable:
• Specimens collected in tubes with preservatives or
anticoagulants.
• Specimens arriving in the laboratory more than 6 hours after
collection.
• Specimens without proper labeling (i.e., missing collection date/
time or patient identification).
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• LC-MS/MS or HPLC instrument capable of detecting and
quantifying ALA.
• ALA calibrators and controls.
• LC-MS/MS or HPLC-grade reagents and solvents.
• Water bath or heating block.
• Centrifuge.
• Disposable pipettes and tips.
• Sterile, labeled containers for sample collection.
• Personal protective equipment (PPE), including gloves, lab coats,
and goggles.
4. PROCEDURE
Sample Preparation:
1. Ensure the urine specimen is at room temperature prior to
analysis. If the sample was refrigerated, allow it to equilibrate
for at least 30 minutes.
2. Thoroughly mix the urine sample by gentle inversion or
vortexing to ensure homogeneity.
Extraction:
1. Aliquot 5 mL of urine into a clean, labeled centrifuge tube.
2. Add an internal standard appropriate for ALA quantification if
required for the analysis method.
3. Perform protein precipitation by adding 1 mL of acetonitrile or
other appropriate solvent. Mix thoroughly.
4. Centrifuge the mixture at 3,000 rpm for 10 minutes to separate
precipitated proteins from the supernatant.
5. Transfer the clear supernatant into a clean tube, avoiding the
pellet.
Analysis:
By LC-MS/MS:
1. Set up the LC-MS/MS instrument following the manufacturer’s
guidelines.
2. Inject a suitable volume (e.g., 10 µL) of the prepared sample
into the instrument.
3. Run the analytical sequence, including calibration standards,
quality control samples, and patient specimens.
4. Ensure calibration curves are linear and controls are within
defined limits before interpreting patient results.
By HPLC:
1. Set up the HPLC instrument according to the manufacturer’s
guidelines.
2. Inject a suitable volume (e.g., 20 µL) of the prepared sample
into the column.
3. Utilize a detection method suitable for ALA (e.g., UV or
fluorometric detection).
4. Ensure calibration curves are linear and controls are within
defined limits before interpreting patient results.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Run quality control samples at the beginning and end of each
batch of patient samples to ensure analytical accuracy and
precision.
2. Document the results of control samples, ensuring they fall
within acceptable limits.
3. Recalibrate the instrument if the control results exceed
acceptable limits.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Review and verify the results against reference intervals.
2. Document the results in the laboratory information system
(LIS), noting any discrepancies or anomalies observed during
the analysis.
3. Report critical values promptly according to the laboratory’s
protocol.
4. Generate a final report and review with a supervisor if required.
7. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Normal reference intervals for urinary ALA will be provided in the
instrument's documentation or the testing kit's insert, typically ranging
from 1.0 to 5.0 mg/L. Ensure that reference intervals are updated
according to manufacturer's recommendations.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to specific instrument and reagent kit limitations as detailed in
their inserts and operating manuals. Ensure all limitations are
understood and documented.
