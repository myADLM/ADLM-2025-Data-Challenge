Analytical Phase Protocol for Generating Results for
AMINO ACIDS, MAPLE SYRUP URINE DISEASE
(MSUD) PANEL, PLASMA
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this protocol is to outline the steps necessary for the
analysis of plasma amino acids, particularly focusing on the Maple
Syrup Urine Disease (MSUD) panel. This protocol ensures consistent
and reliable results.
2. SCOPE
This protocol applies to all laboratory personnel performing the
MSUD panel testing on plasma samples in our CLIA-certified
laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Detecting Clerical Errors: Laboratory personnel are responsible
for verifying the accuracy of patient details and sample
identification.
• Sample Preparation: Designated laboratory scientists are
responsible for correctly preparing the samples, following
specified steps to ensure reliability.
• Analysis Execution: Laboratory scientists perform the analysis
according to standard operating procedures.
• Data Validation: Laboratory scientists and managers oversee the
review, validation, and approval of the test results before and after
they are uploaded to the laboratory information system (LIS).
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND HANDLING
• Specimen Type: Plasma
• Collection: Blood should be drawn into EDTA or heparin tubes,
then centrifuged immediately at 4°C to separate plasma.
• Volume: A minimum of 1 mL of plasma is necessary for analysis.
• Storage: Plasma samples must be stored at -80°C if analysis is
not performed immediately.
• Transport: Samples must be shipped on dry ice to maintain the
low temperature if transferred between locations.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) system
• Plasma filtration devices
• Centrifuge (refrigerated)
• Micro-pipettes and tips
• Analytical-grade amino acid standards
• Quality control materials
• Ultra-pure water and solvents (e.g., methanol, acetonitrile)
• Labware (e.g., Eppendorf tubes, vials)
6. CALIBRATION AND QUALITY CONTROL
• Calibration: Calibrate the LC-MS/MS system using certified
amino acid standards before running patient samples.
• Quality Control:
◦ Run quality control samples (both high and low concentration)
before each batch of patient samples.
◦ Acceptable ranges for quality control samples are predefined
and must be adhered to.
◦ If quality control results fall outside the acceptable range, do
not proceed with patient sample analysis until the issue is
resolved.
7. PROCEDURE
A) Sample Preparation:
1. Thaw the plasma samples on ice if frozen.
2. Pipette 100 µL of plasma into a labeled microcentrifuge tube.
3. Add 400 µL of precipitating solvent (methanol or acetonitrile) to
each sample.
4. Vortex the mixture vigorously for 1 minute.
5. Centrifuge the samples at 13,000 rpm for 15 minutes at 4°C.
6. Carefully transfer the supernatant into new labeled tubes,
avoiding the pellet.
B) LC-MS/MS Analysis:
1. Prepare the LC-MS/MS system according to the instrument's
user manual, ensuring proper calibration and maintenance.
2. Load the prepared plasma samples, calibration standards, and
quality control samples onto the autosampler.
3. Set the appropriate LC-MS/MS method for amino acid analysis,
ensuring the detection of the key amino acids relevant to
MSUD, such as leucine, isoleucine, and valine.
4. Start the analysis sequence, ensuring that all samples are run
under identical conditions.
C) Data Acquisition and Processing:
1. Monitor the LC-MS/MS system during the run, ensuring proper
function and resolution of analytes.
2. Export the acquired data to the laboratory information
management system (LIMS) for processing.
3. Perform initial data review, comparing results to calibration
standards and quality control samples.
D) Result Verification and Reporting:
1. Verify all test results by comparing the patient sample peaks
with those of the calibration standards.
2. Validate the results by checking for consistency within quality
control ranges and reviewing any flagged values requiring
retesting.
3. Enter or upload validated results into the LIS, ensuring proper
documentation.
4. Authorized personnel will review and approve results before
final reporting.
5. Report any critical or abnormal results immediately to the
physician or requester as per laboratory protocol.
8. TROUBLESHOOTING AND MAINTENANCE
• If calibration or quality control samples fall outside the acceptable
range, inspect the system for potential issues such as leaks,
column integrity, or reagent contamination.
• Follow the manufacturer’s guidelines for routine maintenance of
the LC-MS/MS system.
• Keep records of all maintenance protocols and corrective actions
taken.
