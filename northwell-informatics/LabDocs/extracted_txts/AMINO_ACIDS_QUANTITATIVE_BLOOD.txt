Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Quantitative Amino Acid
Analysis in Blood
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to provide standardized instructions
for the quantitative analysis of amino acids in blood samples, in order
to ensure the accuracy and reliability of test results.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for carrying out the
amino acid analysis, ensuring proper equipment function, quality
control, and documentation of results. It is the responsibility of all staff
to recognize any issues that may affect the accuracy of the test
results and report them to the supervisor.
2. DEFINITIONS
Amino acids are organic compounds that combine to form proteins.
This analysis quantitatively measures the concentration of individual
amino acids in a blood specimen.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
• Specimen Type: Blood collected in a heparinized plasma tube.
• Specimen Volume: Minimum 2 mL of plasma.
• Collection: Ensure proper mixing to prevent clotting. Cap and
label the tube properly.
• Storage and Stability:
◦ Room Temperature: Amino acids in plasma are stable for up
to 4 hours.
◦ Refrigerated (2-8°C): Stable for up to 72 hours.
◦ Frozen (-20°C or lower): Stable for up to 1 month. Avoid
repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Analytical HPLC (High-Performance Liquid Chromatography)
System with Fluorescence or UV Detection.
• Amino Acid Standard Kit.
• Derivatization Reagents (O-phthalaldehyde or similar).
• HPLC grade solvents (e.g., acetonitrile, water, methanol).
• Microcentrifuge tubes, pipettes, and tips.
5. PROCEDURE
5.1 PREPARATION
1. Daily Equipment Check:
◦ Verify that the HPLC system is functioning properly.
◦ Ensure the column is correctly installed and equilibrated.
◦ Check solvent levels and waste container.
2. Preparation of Calibration Standards:
◦ Prepare amino acid standards according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
◦ Run at least six dilutions of the standard to create a
calibration curve.
3. Preparation of Samples and Quality Controls:
◦ Thaw frozen plasma samples at room temperature if
applicable.
◦ Vortex each sample to ensure homogeneity.
◦ Aliquot 50 µL of plasma into microcentrifuge tubes.
5.2 DERIVATIZATION
1. Add 100 µL of derivatization reagent to each plasma aliquot.
2. Vortex briefly and incubate at room temperature for 10 minutes.
3. Centrifuge samples at 10,000 rpm for 10 minutes to remove
any precipitates.
5.3 HPLC OPERATION
1. Sample Injection:
◦ Load the prepared samples, calibration standards, and
quality control samples into the HPLC autosampler.
◦ Program the HPLC system with the appropriate gradient
profile and detection settings for amino acids.
2. Run Sequence:
◦ Start the HPLC sequence by injecting a blank, followed by
calibration standards, quality controls, and plasma samples.
◦ Ensure all samples and standards are run in duplicate for
accuracy.
3. Data Collection:
◦ The HPLC software will collect and process
chromatographic data.
◦ Review the chromatograms for peak identification and
integration.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include two levels of quality control samples (normal and
elevated) with each batch of samples.
• Verify that the QC results fall within the acceptable range before
reporting patient results.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Review Results:
◦ Compare the sample results against the calibration curve.
◦ Validate that all QC samples meet the required
specifications.
2. Result Documentation:
◦ Enter the quantitative results into the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
◦ Ensure all results are checked and signed off by a qualified
technologist.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Ensure not to use hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples as they
might interfere with the analysis.
• Accuracy is dependent on proper instrument calibration and
maintenance.

• Use the manufacturer’s instructions and recommendations for the
amino acid standard kit and derivatization reagents.
• HPLC System Instruction Manual.
