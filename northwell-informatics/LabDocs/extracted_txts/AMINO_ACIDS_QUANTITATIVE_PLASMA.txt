Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for AMINO ACIDS, QUANTITATIVE, PLASMA
1. PURPOSE
This procedure outlines the analytical phase for generating
quantitative results of amino acids in plasma samples using
high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).
Responsibility: Designated laboratory staff will follow the
procedures to ensure accurate and reliable results are obtained for
quantitative amino acids analysis. Supervisors will ensure the
procedure is followed and any deviations are documented and
addressed.
1. SPECIMEN
Acceptable Specimens:
◦ 2 mL of plasma collected in an EDTA tube.
◦ Specimens must be centrifuged within 30 minutes of
collection at a temperature of 4°C, and plasma should be
transferred to a labeled cryovial.
◦ Plasma samples should be stored at -20°C or lower until
analysis.
Unacceptable Specimens:
◦ Hemolyzed samples, as red blood cell contamination can
interfere with the analysis.
◦ Specimens not stored properly after collection.
◦ Specimens with an unreported collection time/date.
2. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
◦ High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system
with a fluorescence detector.
◦ Centrifuge
◦ Vortex mixer
◦ Pipettes with disposable tips
◦ Analytical balance
Reagents:
◦ Mobile phase solution (as specified by the HPLC protocol)
◦ Calibration standards containing a known concentration of
amino acids
◦ Internal standard solution
◦ Derivatization reagent (e.g., o-phthalaldehyde (OPA))
Supplies:
◦ HPLC columns suitable for amino acid analysis
◦ Sample vials and caps
◦ Cryovials
◦ Reagent bottles
◦ Syringe filters (0.2 µm)
3. PROCEDURE
Pre-Analytical Steps:
◦ Thaw plasma samples at room temperature.
◦ Vortex samples to ensure homogeneity.
◦ Centrifuge samples at 4°C for 5 minutes at 2000 x g to
remove any particulates.
◦ Transfer the supernatant to a clean labeled sample vial.
Preparation of Standards and Quality Controls:
◦ Prepare calibration standards and quality control samples at
various concentrations according to laboratory protocol.
◦ Include an internal standard in each calibration standard
and quality control sample.
Sample Preparation:
◦ Pipette a defined volume of plasma (e.g., 100 µL) into a
sample vial.
◦ Add an equal volume of the internal standard solution to
each sample.
◦ Vortex mix for 30 seconds.
◦ Add the derivatization reagent to each sample and incubate
for the recommended time at room temperature protected
from light.
◦ Filter through a 0.2 µm syringe filter directly into HPLC vials.
HPLC Setup and Analysis:
◦ Set up the HPLC instrument according to the manufacturer's
instructions and method SOP.
◦ Load the prepared samples, calibration standards, and QC
samples onto the HPLC autosampler.
◦ Start the HPLC run according to the method SOP, ensuring
the appropriate column, mobile phase, and gradient
conditions are used.
◦ Obtain chromatograms and peak integrations for each
amino acid of interest.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Run quality control samples at the beginning, midpoint, and
end of each batch to ensure the accuracy and reliability of
the results.
◦ Compare the results of QC samples against the established
reference ranges and document any deviations.
◦ Investigate and rectify any out-of-range QC results before
proceeding with sample analysis.
5. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ Review chromatograms and peak integrations for each
sample.
◦ Quantitate the amino acids by comparing the sample
chromatograms to those of the calibration standards.
◦ Document the concentrations of each amino acid in the
laboratory information system (LIS).
◦ Verify results and ensure they are reported to the clinician in
a timely and accurate manner according to site-specific
reporting guidelines.
6. REFERENCE INTERVALS
◦ Refer to the laboratory's established reference intervals for
amino acids in plasma for interpreting the results. Provide
these intervals in the result report if needed.
7. METHOD LIMITATIONS
◦ The accuracy of results is dependent on sample integrity,
proper handling, and adherence to the outlined procedures.
◦ Hemolyzed samples can interfere with the analysis and lead
to inaccurate results.
◦ Refer to the HPLC instrument's manual for any specific
equipment limitations.

◦ HPLC instrument manual and specific protocol inserts.
◦ Relevant peer-reviewed articles and laboratory guidelines
for plasma amino acid quantification.
