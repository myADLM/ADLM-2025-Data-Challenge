Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Quantitative
Determination of Amino Acids in Random Urine Samples
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedure for the
quantitative determination of amino acids in random urine samples
using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). This protocol
ensures accuracy, precision, and reliability of test results.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel involved in the analysis
of amino acids in random urine samples.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• The designated laboratory personnel are responsible for
conducting the analysis according to this SOP.
• The supervisor is responsible for training and ensuring
compliance with this SOP.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred Specimen: 10 mL of random urine collected in a clean,
sterile container.
• Specimen Handling: Samples should be refrigerated at 2-8°C if
not analyzed immediately. Samples must be brought to room
temperature before analysis.
• Unacceptable Specimens: Samples contaminated with feces or
other foreign matter, mislabeled samples, or samples without a
collection date/time.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• High-Performance Liquid Chromatograph (HPLC) system
• Amino acid analysis kit (including calibration standards and
internal standards)
• Sterile, clean containers for sample collection
• Centrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Deionized water
• Mobile-phase solvents for HPLC (as per manufacturer’s
instructions)
• pH meter and buffers
• Sample filters (0.45 µm)
• Laboratory glassware (e.g., beakers, flasks)
6. PROCEDURE
6.1 Sample Preparation
1. Allow the urine sample to reach room temperature.
2. Mix the urine sample thoroughly by vortexing.
3. Transfer a 5 mL aliquot of the urine sample into a centrifuge
tube.
4. Centrifuge the sample at 1500 x g for 10 minutes to remove any
particulate matter.
5. Decant the supernatant into a clean container.
6. If necessary, adjust the pH of the sample to 2.2 using 6N HCl.
6.2 HPLC System Preparation
1. Turn on the HPLC system and allow it to stabilize as per the
manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Prepare mobile phases according to the manufacturer's
guidelines.
3. Prime and equilibrate the HPLC system with the mobile phase.
4. Perform routine system checks, including calibration and
system suitability tests, according to manufacturer’s guidelines.
6.3 Calibration and Quality Control
1. Prepare calibration standards by diluting the stock solutions of
amino acids to the desired concentrations.
2. Prepare quality control (QC) samples at low, medium, and high
concentrations.
3. Run calibration standards and QC samples through the HPLC
to generate calibration curves and verify system performance.
6.4 Sample Analysis
1. Filter the prepared urine sample using a 0.45 µm filter to
remove any remaining particulates.
2. Inject a suitable volume (e.g., 20 µL) of the filtered sample into
the HPLC system.
3. Record the chromatogram and analyze the peaks
corresponding to the amino acids of interest.
4. Compare the sample peaks with the calibration curves to
determine the concentrations of amino acids in the urine
sample.
6.5 Data Analysis and Reporting
1. Review the chromatograms for any anomalies or interferences.
2. Quantify the amino acid concentrations using the calibration
curves.
3. Document the results in the laboratory information system
(LIS).
4. Verify the results to ensure consistency and accuracy.
5. Report the results according to the laboratory’s reporting
guidelines.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Run QC samples with each batch of patient samples.
2. Analyze and document the QC results to ensure they fall within
acceptable limits.
3. If QC results are outside the acceptable range, troubleshoot the
HPLC system and repeat the QC analysis before proceeding
with patient samples.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the HPLC system’s user manual and the amino acid analysis
kit documentation for potential limitations, including:
• Interference from substances present in the urine.
• Sensitivity limits of the detection system.
9. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s guidelines for the HPLC system.
