Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Analytical Phase
for AMINO ACIDS, QUANTITATIVE, SPINAL FLUID
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the quantitative analysis of
amino acids in spinal fluid using high-performance liquid
chromatography (HPLC) or other validated analytical methods to
ensure accuracy, repeatability, and reliability of test results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
All laboratory personnel performing amino acid analysis in spinal fluid
must be trained and competent in the analytical procedures
described in this SOP. It is the responsibility of the laboratory
supervisor to ensure all personnel adhere strictly to this SOP and to
oversee the resolution of any issues that may arise during the
analytical phase.
3. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all spinal fluid samples that have been collected,
received, and accessioned for the quantitative analysis of amino
acids.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) system or
other validated analytical instrument
• Amino acid standard solution set
• HPLC-grade solvents (e.g., water, methanol, acetonitrile)
• Reagent kits specific for amino acid analysis
• Analytical balance
• Micropipettes and tips
• Centrifuge
• Spinal fluid sample collection tubes
• Vortex mixer
• Calibration standards
• Control samples
5. PROCEDURE
5.1. PREPARATION OF REAGENTS AND STANDARDS
5.1.1. Preparation of Mobile Phase
• Prepare the mobile phase according to the manufacturer's
instructions or laboratory-validated method.
• Filter and degas mobile phase before use.
5.1.2. Preparation of Calibration Standards
• Prepare calibration standards at concentrations specified by the
manufacturer or according to laboratory-validated method.
• Store standards as stated by the manufacturer's guidelines.
5.1.3. Control Samples
• Prepare control samples at both high and low concentration
ranges.
• Store controls as recommended by the manufacturer.
5.2. SAMPLE PREPARATION
5.2.1. Sample Identification and Verification
• Verify that the spinal fluid sample is correctly labeled and matches
the corresponding accession number.
5.2.2. Centrifugation
• Centrifuge the spinal fluid sample at 10,000 x g for 10 minutes to
remove any particulate matter.
5.2.3. Aliquoting
• Aliquot the clear supernatant into clean, labeled microcentrifuge
tubes.
• If samples need to be stored, keep them at -80°C until ready for
analysis to prevent degradation.
5.3. INSTRUMENT SETUP
5.3.1. HPLC System Setup
• Ensure the HPLC system is calibrated and maintenance
performed as per the manufacturer's guidelines.
• Set up the system parameters including the flow rate, column
temperature, and detection wavelength according to the validated
method.
5.3.2. Calibration Curve Preparation
• Run calibration standards through the HPLC to generate a
calibration curve.
• Ensure that the calibration curve meets the acceptance criteria
(e.g., linearity, correlation coefficient).
5.4. SAMPLE ANALYSIS
5.4.1. Loading Samples onto HPLC
• Load the prepared spinal fluid samples, calibration standards, and
control samples onto the HPLC autosampler.
5.4.2. Running the Analysis
• Initiate the HPLC run using the validated method protocol.
• Monitor the HPLC system throughout the run for any issues (e.g.,
pressure fluctuations, baseline stability).
5.5. DATA ANALYSIS AND INTERPRETATION
5.5.1. Data Collection
• Collect chromatographic data for each sample, calibration
standard, and control sample.
5.5.2. Quantitation
• Integrate peaks of the chromatograms using the software
associated with the HPLC system.
• Calculate the concentration of amino acids in spinal fluid samples
using the calibration curve.
5.5.3. Quality Control
• Analyze quality control samples to ensure the accuracy and
precision of the results.
• Results must fall within the acceptable range for the method.
5.6. REPORTING RESULTS
5.6.1. Verification and Validation
• Verify that all results are within the acceptable range before
reporting.
• Validate results by comparing with quality control data.
5.6.2. Documentation
• Document results in the laboratory information system (LIS).
5.6.3. Reporting
• Report the results to the requesting physician or entity according
to the laboratory’s reporting guidelines.
6. QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE
• Perform internal and external quality control procedures as per
the laboratory’s quality management system.
• Follow corrective actions in case of out-of-control situations.
