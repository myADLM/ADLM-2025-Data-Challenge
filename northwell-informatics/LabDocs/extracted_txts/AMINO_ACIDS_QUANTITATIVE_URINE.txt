Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase Protocol for Generating Results of AMINO
ACIDS, QUANTITATIVE, URINE
1. PURPOSE
To describe the procedures for the quantitative analysis of amino
acids in urine samples to ensure accurate detection, identification,
and quantification utilizing appropriate instrumentation and
methodologies.
Responsibility:
• Designated staff are responsible for performing the analysis and
ensuring all steps are followed as described in this protocol.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Acceptable Specimen:
• Freshly voided urine collected in a clean container.
• 24-hour urine collection, properly stored and labeled.
• Minimum volume required: 10 mL.
• Specimens must be received within 48 hours of collection and
should be kept refrigerated at 2-8°C during storage or transport.
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Specimens not labeled with the collection date and time.
• Specimens with signs of contamination or improper storage.
• Specimens with less than 10 mL of urine.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) system or
Mass Spectrometry (MS)
• Centrifuge
• Calibrated pipettes and volumetric flasks
• Water bath/heating block (if required for derivatization)
Reagents and Supplies:
• Derivatization reagents (if applicable for MS or HPLC)
• Calibration standards for amino acids
• Urine collection containers
• Control samples and QC materials specific to amino acids
analysis
• HPLC/MS grade solvents
• Sample vials and caps
1. PROCEDURE
Sample Preparation:
1. Verify the specimen labeling and acceptability criteria.
2. Ensure samples are at room temperature before analysis;
centrifuge samples at 2000-3000 rpm for 10 minutes if required
to remove particulate matter.
3. Transfer the supernatant to a clean labeled sample vial.
Instrument Preparation:
1. Perform daily maintenance and calibration checks for HPLC/MS
system before analysis.
2. Prepare calibration standards and quality control samples for
amino acids analysis.
Quantitative Analysis:
1. Inject the calibration standards into the HPLC/MS system and
create calibration curves for each amino acid.
2. Inject the sample into the HPLC/MS system.
3. Monitor and record the elution times and peak areas of the
amino acids.
4. Apply the calibration curve to quantify the amino acids in the
urine sample.
5. Perform derivatization if necessary, based on specific
instrumentation requirements.
Quality Control:
1. Run QC samples periodically during the batch analysis to
ensure the accuracy of results.
2. Check the control sample results against established
acceptance criteria.
3. Document any corrective action taken in case of deviations
from QC standards.
Reporting Results:
1. Review chromatograms/spectra for each sample for accuracy
and precision.
2. Report results according to the established reporting guidelines.
3. Transmit results to the Laboratory Information System (LIS) for
validation and verification.
4. Record any observation of sample integrity issues and act
accordingly.
5. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Ensure compliance with instrument manufacturer instructions to
avoid interferences.
• Refer to HPLC/MS manufacturer insert for individual method
limitations.
• Report results with appropriate comments if certain amino acids
are outside the expected concentration ranges due to
interference.
1. REFERENCES
• HPLC manufacturer insert/manual
• MS manufacturer insert/manual
• Relevant peer-reviewed literature on amino acids quantification
1. DOCUMENTATION AND RECORD KEEPING
• Maintain documentation of calibration curves, QC results,
instrument maintenance logs, and sample analysis reports.
• Archive records securely as per laboratory policy.
1. SAFETY AND COMPLIANCE
• Follow all laboratory safety protocols, including wearing
appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE).
• Comply with CLIA regulations and laboratory quality assurance
procedures.
By adhering to this Standard Operating Procedure, laboratory
personnel ensure the integrity and accuracy of quantitative amino
acid analysis in urine samples, contributing to high-quality patient
care and outcomes.
