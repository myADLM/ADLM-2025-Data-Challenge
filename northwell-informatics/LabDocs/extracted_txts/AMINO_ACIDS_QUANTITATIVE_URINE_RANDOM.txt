• Syringe filters (0.22 μm pore size) for sample filtration
5. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation:
1. Centrifugation:
◦ Centrifuge the urine sample at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes to
remove particulates.
◦ Transfer the supernatant to a clean tube using a disposable
pipette.
2. Dilution (if required):
◦ Dilute the urine sample with an appropriate buffer if the
concentration of amino acids is anticipated to be high.
3. Derivatization:
◦ Prepare the derivatization reagent as per manufacturer's
instructions.
◦ Mix an aliquot of the urine sample with the derivatization
reagent in a sample vial.
◦ Incubate the mixture at room temperature for the time
specified by the derivatization protocol.
4. Filtration:
◦ Filter the derivatized sample through a 0.22 μm syringe filter
into an HPLC vial.
B. Standard Preparation:
1. Preparation of Calibration Standards:
◦ Prepare serial dilutions of the amino acid standard mixture
in buffer.
◦ Derivatize the standards using the same procedure as for
the urine samples.
2. Preparation of Quality Controls:
◦ Prepare quality control (QC) samples at low, medium, and
high concentrations within the expected range of the assay.
◦ Derivatize the QC samples using the same procedure as for
the urine samples.
C. HPLC Analysis:
1. System Setup:
◦ Set up the HPLC system according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
◦ Equilibrate the column with the mobile phase for at least 30
minutes before starting the analysis.
2. Injection:
◦ Inject the derivatized sample, standards, and QC samples
into the HPLC system.
3. Chromatography Conditions:
◦ Follow the specific chromatography conditions for the amino
acids analysis. This includes:
▪ Mobile phase composition
▪ Flow rate
▪ Column temperature
▪ Detection wavelength (fluorescence or UV)
4. Run the Sequence:
◦ Run a sequence including a blank, calibration standards,
QC samples, and urine samples.
◦ Ensure that QC samples are analyzed at intervals to monitor
system performance.
D. Data Analysis:
1. Integration and Quantitation:
◦ Integrate the peaks for individual amino acids.
◦ Calculate the concentration of amino acids in the urine
samples by comparing the peak area against the calibration
curve obtained from the standards.
2. Acceptance Criteria:
◦ Ensure the correlation coefficient (R²) of the calibration
curve is ≥0.98.
◦ Verify that QC samples are within acceptable limits.
3. Reporting:
◦ Report the concentration of amino acids in µmol/L.
◦ Review and verify results before reporting to the LIS.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run QC samples at the beginning, middle, and end of each batch.
• Ensure that QC results are within specified ranges before
reporting patient results.
• Perform system maintenance and calibrations as per
manufacturer’s guidelines.
7. LIMITATIONS
• Hemolysis or contamination of the urine sample may affect the
results.
• Improper derivatization can lead to incomplete reaction and
inaccurate quantitation.

method changes, instrumentation updates, or regulatory
requirements.
