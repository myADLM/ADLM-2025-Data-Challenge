Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Amino Acids, Urea Cycle Disorders
Panel, Plasma
1. Purpose
This protocol outlines the procedures for analyzing plasma samples
for amino acids and urea cycle disorders. It ensures that the
analytical phase is performed correctly, and the results are reliable
and accurate.
2. Responsibility
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for adhering to this SOP
to perform the analysis. Supervisors are responsible for ensuring all
staff are trained and competent to perform these procedures.
3. Equipment and Reagents
• Amino Acid Analyzer (AAA)
• HPLC system with appropriate columns and detectors
• Reagent kits for amino acid analysis (including internal standards)
• Calibration standards
• Quality control materials
• Sodium citrate tubes for plasma collection
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes and tips
• Vortex mixer
• Ultra-low freezer (-80°C)
• Sample vials and caps
• Gloves and other PPE
4. Specimen Requirements
Specimen Type: Plasma
Collection Instructions:
• Collect blood in sodium citrate tubes.
• Centrifuge within 30 minutes of collection at 1500 x g for 10-15
minutes at 4°C.
• Aliquot plasma into appropriately labeled vials.
• Plasma must be frozen immediately and stored at -80°C until
analysis.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed samples
• Samples collected in the wrong tube type
• Plasma not centrifuged within 30 minutes of collection
• Plasma stored at incorrect temperatures
5. Procedure
Preparation:
1. Thaw plasma samples at room temperature.
2. Vortex samples to ensure homogeneity.
Sample Preparation:
1. Pipette an appropriate volume of plasma (as per the assay's
requirement) into sample vials.
2. Add internal standards (as specified by the assay protocol).
3. Vortex the samples to mix thoroughly.
4. If required, perform protein precipitation by adding the
precipitating agent, vortex, and centrifuge at 10,000 x g for 10
minutes.
5. Transfer the supernatant to new sample vials for analysis.
Instrument Calibration:
1. Prepare calibration standards according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
2. Run calibration standards on the analyzer and ensure that the
instrument is properly calibrated.
3. Verify calibration with quality control samples at multiple levels.
Analysis:
1. Load the prepared samples onto the Amino Acid Analyzer or
HPLC system.
2. Select the appropriate method for amino acid and urea cycle
disorder panel analysis.
3. Run the samples according to the instrument’s operation
manual.
4. Monitor the analysis to ensure proper functioning of the
instrument.
Quality Control:
1. Run quality control samples at the beginning, middle, and end
of the batch.
2. Record and review QC results to ensure they are within
acceptable limits.
3. Investigate and resolve any out-of-range QC results before
continuing with patient sample analysis.
Interpreting Results:
1. Compare the generated results with reference ranges for amino
acids and metabolites associated with urea cycle disorders.
2. Identify any significant deviations that may indicate metabolic
abnormalities.
6. Reporting Results
1. Ensure all data are reviewed and verified by a qualified
technologist.
2. Transmit results to the Laboratory Information System (LIS) for
final review.
3. Review and release results according to laboratory and
regulatory requirements.
7. Method Limitations
Refer to the instrument’s manual and reagent kit insert for any
method limitations, including potential interfering substances and
sample stability concerns.
8. References
• Instrument operation manuals (AAA, HPLC)
• Reagent kit package inserts
• Laboratory Information System guidelines
• Relevant Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI)
documents
9. Documentation
• Record all specimens, calibration, QC, and patient results in
appropriate logs.
• Maintain equipment maintenance logs as per laboratory policy.
10. Safety and Compliance
• Follow standard laboratory safety protocols.
• Use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) and handle
all specimens as biohazardous material.
• Dispose of waste according to biosafety and hazardous material
guidelines.
By following this SOP, the laboratory ensures the accurate and
efficient generation of results for amino acids and urea cycle
disorders in plasma, thereby supporting proper diagnosis and patient
care.
