Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Generating
Results for Amiodarone, Serum
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the quantitative analysis of
Amiodarone levels in serum samples. This ensures consistency,
accuracy, and reliability in the resulting data, which is critical for
clinical decision-making and patient care.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
Laboratory personnel trained in the use of the specific analytical
equipment and methodologies for Amiodarone, Serum, are
responsible for performing the analyses as outlined in this SOP.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred Specimen:
• Serum collected in a plain red-top tube or serum separator tube
(SST).
Specimen Volume:
• A minimum volume of 1 mL of serum is required.
Specimen Handling:
• Centrifuge and separate serum from cells within 2 hours of
collection.
• Store serum at 2-8°C if analysis is to be performed within 24
hours. For longer storage, freeze the serum at -20°C or lower.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
• Specimens collected in anticoagulant tubes (e.g., EDTA, heparin).
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) system with
UV detector
• Amiodarone standard solutions
• Mobile phase reagents (typically a combination of solvent such as
acetonitrile and buffer)
• Calibration standards and quality control materials
• Analytical-grade solvents
• Sample vials and caps
5. PROCEDURE
Pre-Analytical Phase:
• Verify and log the sample information in the Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
• Ensure sample integrity by inspecting for signs of hemolysis,
lipemia, or improper handling.
Preparation of Standards and Controls:
• Prepare calibration standards covering the expected range of
Amiodarone concentrations in patient samples.
• Prepare quality control materials of known concentration to
validate the assay (e.g., low, median, high levels).
Sample Preparation:
1. Thaw any frozen samples in a controlled manner at room
temperature.
2. Vortex the sample gently to ensure homogeneity.
3. Pipette the required volume of serum into a sample vial.
4. Cap vials securely to prevent contamination or evaporation.
HPLC Analysis:
1. Set up the HPLC system according to the manufacturer's
instructions, ensuring that the column and detector are
appropriate for Amiodarone analysis.
2. Load the sample vials into the auto-sampler.
3. Input the sequence of standard, control, and patient samples to
be analyzed.
4. Initiate the run and monitor the system for any anomalies.
Data Acquisition and Interpretation:
1. Review the chromatograms for each sample to ensure proper
peak identification and integration.
2. Compare the peak areas against the calibration curve to
determine the concentration of Amiodarone in each serum
sample.
3. Validate results using quality control materials to ensure the
assay's accuracy and precision.
Troubleshooting:
• If outliers or unexpected results occur, reanalyze the sample or
check for potential instrument or reagent issues.
• Perform system maintenance and calibration as needed.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run at least two levels of quality control materials with each batch
of patient samples.
• Accept or reject runs based on QC results being within predefined
limits.
• Document all QC activities and corrective actions, if any.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
• Enter patient results into the LIS, verifying that all quality control
criteria are met.
• Attach appropriate interpretive comments as required, indicating
the therapeutic or toxic ranges for Amiodarone levels.
8. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Therapeutic range: 0.5 – 2.0 µg/mL
• Toxic range: >2.5 µg/mL
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolyzed samples may interfere with the HPLC detection of
Amiodarone.
• Patients on certain medications may have cross-reactivity or
interference.
10. DOCUMENTATION
• Record all specimen handling, preparation, analysis details, and
results in the LIS.
• Maintain calibration curves, quality control records, and
instrument maintenance logs.
11. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions for HPLC system and reagents.
• Clinical guidelines on therapeutic drug monitoring for Amiodarone.
12. REVIEW AND APPROVAL
This SOP is to be reviewed annually or as required by changes in
methodology or instrumentation. Approval by the Laboratory Director
or Supervisor is mandatory before implementation.
