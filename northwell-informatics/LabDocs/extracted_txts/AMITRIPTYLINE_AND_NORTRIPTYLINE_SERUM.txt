Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Title: Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Amitriptyline and Nortriptyline in Serum
1. PURPOSE
This procedure outlines the process for the accurate and precise
measurement of amitriptyline and nortriptyline levels in serum
samples. This SOP ensures that all steps in the analytical process
are followed to maintain consistency and reliability of test results.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for the execution of
this procedure, monitoring, quality control, and proper documentation
of results.
1. DEFINITION
Amitriptyline and nortriptyline are tricyclic antidepressants measured
in serum to monitor therapeutic levels and detect possible toxic levels
in patients under treatment.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) system with
UV detection
• Analytical balance
• Centrifuge
• Micropipettes (10 µL to 1000 µL range)
Reagents:
• HPLC grade methanol
• HPLC grade water
• Acetonitrile
• Mobile phase additives (Buffer such as phosphate buffer, pH
adjusted)
• Reference standards for amitriptyline and nortriptyline
• Internal standard (e.g., imipramine) if used
• Serum quality control samples
Supplies:
• Sample vials
• Syringe filters (0.22 µm)
• Disposable pipette tips
• Glass pipettes
• HPLC columns (C18 or equivalent)
1. PROCEDURE
Sample Preparation:
1. Allow serum samples to reach room temperature.
2. Vortex samples for 15 seconds to ensure homogeneity.
3. Centrifuge samples at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes to remove any
particulates.
4. Transfer 0.5 mL of the clear supernatant into a clean sample
vial.
5. If using an internal standard, add it at this stage and mix
thoroughly.
Standard and Calibration Curve Preparation:
1. Prepare stock solutions of amitriptyline and nortriptyline
reference standards in methanol.
2. Prepare calibration standards by diluting stock solutions in
serum to achieve desired concentrations (e.g., 10, 50, 100,
200, and 500 ng/mL).
3. Prepare quality control (QC) samples at low, medium, and high
concentrations.
HPLC System Setup and Sample Analysis:
1. Set up the HPLC system according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
2. Condition the column with the mobile phase (e.g., Methanol:
Water 60:40 with buffer).
3. Set the column temperature to 35°C and UV detector
wavelength to 254 nm.
4. Inject calibration standards, QC samples, and patient serum
samples (50 µL per injection).
5. Run the HPLC system and ensure good chromatographic
separation of analytes.
6. Record retention times and peak areas for amitriptyline,
nortriptyline, and internal standard.
Data Analysis and Calibration Curve:
1. Plot a calibration curve using peak areas against concentration
for the standards.
2. Use linear regression to determine the line of best fit.
3. Calculate the concentrations of amitriptyline and nortriptyline in
patient samples by comparing their peak areas to the
calibration curve.
Quality Control:
1. Analyze QC samples with each batch of patient samples.
2. Ensure QC results fall within the acceptable range before
releasing patient results.
3. Repeat runs for any samples or QC samples that fall outside
acceptable ranges.
Reporting Results:
1. Result values for amitriptyline and nortriptyline should be
reported in ng/mL.
2. Document all steps including sample preparation, equipment
usage, and any deviations.
3. Verify results prior to releasing reports.
4. REFERENCES
Ensure to refer to equipment user manuals and manufacturer's insert
for HPLC column and reagents. Maintain a reference library with
scientific literature relevant to therapeutic drug monitoring and HPLC
analysis of serum.
