Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase:
Determination of Ammonia in Plasma
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedure for the
determination and quantification of ammonia in plasma samples in a
CLIA-certified laboratory. This procedure ensures accurate, precise,
and timely generation of ammonia results, which are critical for
patient diagnosis and management.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of all designated laboratory staff to adhere to
this SOP while performing ammonia assays. Supervisors are
responsible for overseeing protocol adherence, troubleshooting, and
documenting any deviations.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/Acceptable Specimen:
• Plasma collected in a heparinized tube (dark green or PST).
• Specimen should be delivered to the laboratory within 30 minutes
of collection.
• Plasma should be separated from cells immediately after
collection.
• Specimen should be kept on ice during transportation to the lab.
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Specimens not kept on ice during transport.
• Specimens delivered to the lab more than 30 minutes after
collection.
• Specimens with visible hemolysis.
• Specimens collected in non-heparinized tubes.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Heparinized vacutainer tubes.
• Ice or cold packs for transport.
• Centrifuge for plasma separation.
• Automated ammonia analyzer or spectrophotometric assay kit.
• Ammonia calibrators, control materials, and reagents specific to
the assay method used.
• Personal protective equipment (gloves, lab coat, safety glasses).
4. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Ensure all equipment is calibrated and in proper working
condition.
2. Verify the availability of all necessary reagents and control
materials.
Specimen Handling:
1. Upon receipt, verify the specimen is on ice and note the time of
collection.
2. If the specimen has been transported on ice, proceed to
centrifugation immediately.
3. Centrifuge the heparinized tube at 2,000-3,000 rpm for 10
minutes to separate plasma from cells.
4. Carefully transfer the plasma to a clean, labeled tube and keep
on ice until analysis.
Analytical Procedure:
1. Set up the ammonia analyzer or prepare the
spectrophotometric assay according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
2. Perform calibration using ammonia standards and run
appropriate quality controls.
3. Pipette required volume (as per assay instructions) of plasma
into the assay system.
4. Follow the manufacturer's protocol for incubation, reaction, and
detection phases.
5. Generate and record the ammonia concentration results.
Quality Control:
1. Use both positive and negative control materials to ensure
accuracy of results.
2. Run quality control samples at the beginning of the daily batch,
after calibration, and at intervals throughout the testing process.
3. Check that control results are within acceptable limits. If
controls are out of range, troubleshoot and re-run controls
before proceeding with patient samples.
4. Document all control results in the laboratory quality control log.
5. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Verify all patient sample results, ensuring they fall within the
expected control range.
2. Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
3. Review and verify results in the LIS before final reporting.
4. Notify clinician immediately for any critical values according to
laboratory policy.
5. Document critical calls and actions taken in the result reporting
log.
Reference Intervals:
• Normal range for plasma ammonia: 11-35 µmol/L (note: ranges
can vary slightly based on specific method and population
demographics).
6. QUALITY ASSURANCE AND METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Ensure that all reagents and equipment are within their validity
period and functioning correctly.
• Monitor instrument calibration and maintenance logs.
• Refer to the assay kit insert for limitations and interferences that
may affect the assay, such as hemolysis or prolonged transport
times of the specimen.
7. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's instruction manual for ammonia analyzer/assay
kit.
• Laboratory quality control guidelines.
• Relevant clinical and technical literature on ammonia testing and
patient management.
By following this protocol, the laboratory ensures reliable and timely
results for ammonia levels in plasma, contributing to accurate patient
diagnosis and treatment.
