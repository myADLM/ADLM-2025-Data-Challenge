Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Ammonium, 24 Hour, Urine
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedures for accurately
and efficiently analyzing ammonium levels in 24-hour urine samples.
This includes equipment, reagents, calibration, quality control,
handling, and documentation as per CLIA-certified laboratory
standards.
2. SCOPE
This SOP is applicable to all laboratory personnel who perform
ammonium, 24-hour urine assays.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory personnel to
perform the assay and to ensure compliance with this SOP.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Acceptable Specimens:
• Type: 24-hour urine collection
• Volume: A total collection volume is required; a well-mixed aliquot
of at least 10 mL should be submitted.
• Preservation: Specimen should be refrigerated during collection.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens collected for less than 24 hours.
• Specimens not well-mixed.
• Specimens that have been at room temperature for more than two
hours without refrigeration.
• Specimens with visible contamination or sediment.
5. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
• Analytical balance (for weighing urine)
• Refrigerated centrifuge
• pH meter or pH indicator strips
• Ammonium assay kit (specific brand or type used by the lab, e.g.,
enzymatic or ion-selective electrode methods)
• Laboratory glassware (pipettes, test tubes, beakers, etc.)
• Reagents and calibration standards
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
6. REAGENTS AND STANDARDS PREPARATION
• Reagents: Prepare all reagents as per the manufacturer’s
instructions included with the ammonium assay kit. Label and
date all reagents and store them as specified.
• Standards: Use ammonium standards provided or recommended
by the assay kit manufacturer. Prepare fresh standards before
each use to ensure accuracy.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include both positive and negative controls with each batch of
tests.
• Analyze known concentration standards to assure the accuracy of
the assay.
• Perform quality control checks at the beginning of each day, with
each new lot of reagents, after calibration, and according to the
laboratory’s quality control plan.
8. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation:
1. Ensure all equipment is calibrated and in good working
condition.
2. Centrifuge the 24-hour urine specimen at 2000 x g for 10
minutes to remove any particulates.
B. Assay Procedure:
1. Mix urine well and measure the total volume of the 24-hour
urine collection.
2. Adjust the pH of the urine sample to the required range (usually
between 4.0 and 6.0) using diluted acid or base as necessary.
3. Aliquot 1.0 mL of the centrifuged 24-hour urine sample into a
clean test tube.
4. Follow the specific procedural steps outlined in the ammonium
assay kit manual (e.g., adding reagents, incubating, measuring
the absorbance or electrode response).
C. Measurement:
1. Use the appropriate instrument (spectrophotometer or ion-
selective electrode) to measure the absorbance or ionic
response of the sample.
2. Compare the sample readings against calibration standards to
determine the ammonium concentration.
D. Calculation:
1. Calculate the amount of ammonium in the total 24-hour urine
collection: [ \text{Ammonium (mg/24h)} = \left(
\frac{\text{Concentration (mg/dL)}}{100} \right) \times \text{Total
volume (mL)} ]
9. REPORTING RESULTS
Results should be documented and reviewed for accuracy. Report
the ammonium concentration, expressed as mg/24 hours, in the
laboratory information system (LIS). Any out-of-range values or
anomalous results must be flagged and verified.
10. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Interference due to specimen contamination.
• Assay sensitivity and specificity depending on the selected
method.
• Strict adherence to pH adjustment and proper specimen handling
to avoid degradation of the analyte.
11. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If results are inconsistent or outside of expected ranges, perform
repeat analysis.
• Recheck calibration of instruments and reagents.
• Verify proper specimen handling and storage.
12. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s protocol for the ammonium assay kit in use.
• CLIA regulations and guidelines.
• Laboratory’s internal quality control and standard operating
procedures.
13. DOCUMENTATION
• Maintain complete records of specimen processing, assay
procedures, standards, controls, and results.
• Record any issues encountered and corrective actions taken.
By following this SOP, we ensure the accuracy, reliability, and
consistency of ammonium measurements in 24-hour urine
specimens, upholding the standards required by a CLIA-certified
laboratory.
