Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Ammonium, Random, Urine
1. PURPOSE
To provide standardized procedures for the accurate analysis and
reporting of ammonium levels in random urine samples.
1. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
• Automated chemistry analyzer specifically set for ammonium
assay or manually calibrated spectrophotometer
• Ammonium assay reagent kit
• Calibrators and controls specific for ammonium assay (e.g.,
normal and elevated)
• Specimen cups or containers
• Adjustable micropipettes and tips
• Timer
• Personal protective equipment (PPE) including gloves and lab
coat
• Water bath (if manually heating samples)
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all laboratory personnel to ensure the
accuracy and precision of ammonium determination by following this
SOP. This includes handling specimens properly, running appropriate
quality control checks, and recording all observations and corrective
actions taken during the process.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
• Specimen: Approximately 10 mL of random urine.
• Stability: For optimal results, analyze specimens immediately or
store at 2-8°C for up to 24 hours. If analysis cannot be performed
within 24 hours, refrigerate or freeze (at -20°C) specimens to
minimize changes in concentration.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Handling and Preparation
1. Mix urine specimen thoroughly by gentle inversion to ensure
homogeneity.
2. If the specimen has sediment or is visibly cloudy, centrifuge at
1500 rpm for 10 minutes. Use the supernatant for analysis to
avoid interference.
B. Calibration and Control
1. Prior to running samples, calibrate the chemistry analyzer or
spectrophotometer with the provided ammonium calibrators as
per the manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Analyze control solutions (normal and high-value) for
ammonium assay to ensure assay accuracy. Controls should
fall within established ranges before sample analysis can
proceed.
C. Analysis
Automated Analyzer Procedure
1. Load the urine specimen into the designated sample rack.
2. Ensure that the system is set up with the correct reagents and
calibration parameters.
3. Enter relevant sample information, including patient ID and
order.
4. Start the analysis sequence per manufacturer instructions.
5. Once complete, review the results displayed on the analyzer for
each specimen.
Manual Spectrophotometer Procedure
1. Pipette required volume of reagent and urine sample into
reaction cuvette(s).
2. Mix well and incubate reaction mixture if heating step is
required, as per the manufacturer’s instructions.
3. Set the spectrophotometer to the appropriate wavelength and
blank the instrument with reagent blank.
4. Measure the absorbance of the sample solution.
5. Calculate ammonium concentration from the standard curve
derived from calibrators.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run quality control (QC) samples at the beginning of each shift
and after every 20 patient samples to monitor assay performance
and accuracy.
• Document QC results and ensure they fall within acceptable
ranges.
• If QC results are outside acceptable limits, troubleshoot the
analysis process, recalibrate the system, and rerun controls
before proceeding with patient samples.
• Document all corrective actions taken.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Review all obtained results, ensuring they are consistent with QC
validation.
• Record ammonium levels in the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
• Critical values:
◦ For ammonium results exceeding the specified critical
threshold, notify the ordering physician immediately and
document the communication process.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Normal Reference Range: 1.0 – 20.0 mmol/L
• Note that reference ranges may vary slightly depending on the
patient population and assay calibration. Confirm with the latest
laboratory guidelines.
1. LIMITATIONS
• Handling and storage of urine samples can significantly affect
ammonium levels.
• Ensure samples are stored and processed within the defined time
frame.
• Hemolysis, high turbidity, or contamination in the sample can
interfere with assay results.

By adhering to this SOP, laboratory personnel can ensure consistent,
accurate, and reliable results for ammonium analysis in random urine
samples.
