Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Amoxapine (Asendin)
and 8-Hydroxyamoxapine Analysis
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to outline the steps required for the
analytical phase, including sample preparation, instrument
calibration, sample analysis, and result verification for the detection
and quantitation of Amoxapine (Asendin) and 8-Hydroxyamoxapine.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the trained and designated laboratory staff to
follow this SOP accurately to ensure reliable and reproducible results.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
• Specimen Type: Serum or plasma
• Collection Tube: Use blood collection tubes containing EDTA or
heparin (green-top tubes)
• Volume: Minimum 2 mL of plasma or serum
• Specimen Stability: Sample may be stored at room temperature
(20-25°C) for up to 8 hours. For longer storage, refrigerate at 2–
8°C up to 72 hours. For extended storage, freeze at -20°C or
below for up to 6 months.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND MATERIALS
• High-performance liquid chromatograph (HPLC) or Mass
Spectrometer (MS)
• HPLC Column- specific for amoxapine and its metabolite
• Amoxapine and 8-Hydroxyamoxapine standards
• Solvents: Methanol, water, acetonitrile
• EDTA or heparin blood collection tubes
• Centrifuge
• Syringes, Vials, and Filters (0.22µm)
• Pipettes and tips
• Calibration curves for quantitative standards
5. CALIBRATION AND QUALITY CONTROL
• Prepare a calibration curve using standards of known
concentrations for Amoxapine and 8-Hydroxyamoxapine.
• Include a minimum of 5 standards covering the range of expected
concentrations in the samples.
• Run three levels of quality control samples (low, medium, high)
with each batch of patient specimens to verify instrument
performance.
6. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation
1. Transfer the collected blood sample into appropriate collection
tubes (EDTA or heparin).
2. Allow the blood to clot (if using serum tubes) and centrifuge at
1500 x g for 10 minutes.
3. Pipette the supernatant plasma or serum into a clean labeled
tube.
4. Ensure samples are free of particulates by filtering through a
0.22 µm filter.
B. Sample Analysis Using HPLC-MS/MS
1. Turn on the HPLC-MS/MS system and allow it to equilibrate.
2. Load the prepared samples, standards, and quality control
samples onto the autosampler tray.
3. Run the instrument’s standard operating procedure for
Amoxapine and 8-Hydroxyamoxapine analysis as follows:
◦ Mobile Phase: Methanol:Water (70:30)
◦ Flow Rate: 1 mL/min
◦ Column Temperature: 30°C
◦ Injection Volume: 10 µL
◦ Detection: Multiple Reaction Monitoring (MRM) mode
specific for Amoxapine and 8-Hydroxyamoxapine ions
4. Acquire data for the specified retention times and expected m/z
values for both analytes.
7. DATA ANALYSIS AND RESULT GENERATION
• Integrate the peaks of interest (Amoxapine and 8-
Hydroxyamoxapine) using the dedicated analysis software.
• Quantify the concentration of each compound by comparing the
sample peak areas to the calibration curve.
• Ensure all quality control samples are within predetermined target
ranges; if they are not, re-run the batch.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Verify the results showed consistent retention times and that QC
measures were met within specified limits.
• Transmit the verified results to the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Plasma and serum samples must be freshly prepared or properly
stored to avoid degradation of compounds.
• Ensure the HPLC and MS systems are routinely maintained and
calibrated for optimal performance.

11. DOCUMENTATION
• Maintain all records of calibration, maintenance, and sample
analysis including chromatograms, QC results, and final reported
results in accordance with laboratory protocol.
