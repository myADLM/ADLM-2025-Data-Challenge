Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Analysis of Amoxicillin, IgE,
Serum Levels
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to define the procedures for the analysis
of Amoxicillin and Immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels in serum samples
using the designated laboratory methodologies. This protocol
ensures the accuracy and reliability of test results which are critical
for clinical diagnosis and management.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the
analysis according to the procedures defined in this SOP. It is the
responsibility of all staff to identify any issues during the analysis that
may affect test results and bring them to the attention of a supervisor.
Supervisors are responsible for ensuring that the procedures and any
corrective actions are implemented as required.
1. DEFINITION
The analysis of Amoxicillin and IgE levels shall be performed using
validated and calibrated laboratory instrumentation such as High-
Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) for Amoxicillin and
Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) for IgE.
1. PROCEDURE
A) Sample Preparation:
1. Collection:
◦ Serum samples should be collected in appropriate tubes,
typically clot activator tubes (red top).
◦ Preferably, samples should be collected after the patient has
fasted for 12 hours to avoid interference from lipemia.
2. Storage:
◦ Immediately after collection, serum samples should be
allowed to clot for 30-60 minutes at room temperature.
◦ Centrifuge samples at 2000-3000 rpm for 10-15 minutes.
Transfer the supernatant (serum) into labeled polypropylene
tubes.
◦ Store serum samples at -20°C or lower until analysis.
3. Thawing:
◦ Thaw frozen samples at room temperature or in a
refrigerator at 2-8°C.
◦ Once thawed, samples must be mixed gently but thoroughly
before analysis.
B) Instrument Calibration and Setup:
1. HPLC for Amoxicillin:
◦ Ensure the HPLC system is calibrated monthly according to
the manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Prepare the mobile phase, typically a mixture of water,
acetonitrile, and a pH buffer.
◦ Check system suitability by running standard Amoxicillin
solutions to ensure peak resolution and retention time are
within acceptable limits.
2. ELISA for IgE:
◦ Calibrate the ELISA plate reader according to the
manufacturer's specifications.
◦ Perform a calibration curve from known IgE standards
ranging from low to high concentrations.
◦ Ensure all reagents such as substrate solutions, wash
buffers, and blocking agents are prepared freshly or as
specified by the manufacturer.
C) Analytical Procedure:
1. Analysis of Amoxicillin:
◦ Pipette 100 µL of serum sample into HPLC vials.
◦ Inject the sample into the HPLC system and run according
to established parameters.
◦ Monitor chromatograms for peak identification and
integration. Record retention times and peak areas.
◦ Compare sample peak areas to those of the calibration
curve to determine Amoxicillin concentration in the samples.
2. Quantification of IgE:
◦ Pipette serum samples into the ELISA plate wells as per the
kit’s instructions (usually 50-100 µL per well).
◦ Add detection antibody, followed by substrate solution, and
incubate as specified.
◦ Measure absorbance at the appropriate wavelength using
the ELISA plate reader.
◦ Calculate IgE concentration by comparing sample
absorbance to the standard curve.
D) Quality Control:
1. QC for Amoxicillin:
◦ Run control samples with known Amoxicillin concentrations
in parallel with patient samples.
◦ Calculate recoveries and ensure they fall within ±10% of
expected values.
2. QC for IgE:
◦ Include at least two levels of IgE controls (low and high) in
each assay batch.
◦ The results should be within the acceptable range defined
by the manufacturer.
E) Reporting Results:
• All results should be reviewed and verified by the technologist
before being released.
• Enter the verified concentrations into the Laboratory Information
System (LIS) for official reporting.
• Critical results must be flagged and communicated to the
appropriate clinical staff immediately.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS:
• Amoxicillin: Reference values will be dependent on the
population and condition being treated. Consult standard clinical
guidelines for therapeutic ranges.
• IgE:
◦ 0 to 29 kU/L in adults.
◦ Reference intervals should be age-specific according to
established clinical guidelines.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
• Ensure proper handling to avoid sample contamination or
degradation.
• Verify that serum samples do not contain interfering substances
like hemolysis or extreme lipemia which can affect the accuracy of
the assays.

ELISA systems.

monitoring and IgE immunoassay methods.
