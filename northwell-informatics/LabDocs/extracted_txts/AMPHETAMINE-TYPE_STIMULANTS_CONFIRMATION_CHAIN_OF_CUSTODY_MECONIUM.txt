Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this protocol is to outline the procedures for the
identification and quantification of amphetamine-type stimulants
(ATS) in meconium samples using Chain of Custody (COC)
protocols. This SOP ensures that sample integrity, accuracy, and
precision are maintained throughout the analytical phase.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of all designated laboratory personnel to follow
this SOP precisely to ensure proper sample handling, analysis, and
reporting. The supervisor must ensure that all staff are adequately
trained and that quality control (QC) measures are in place.
1. DEFINITIONS
• ATS: Amphetamine-type stimulants, including amphetamine,
methamphetamine, MDMA (ecstasy), and related compounds.
• COC: Chain of Custody, a process that tracks the possession and
handling of samples from collection to analysis.
• Meconium: The earliest stool of an infant, used for drug testing.
1. PROCEDURE
3.1 Sample Receipt and Chain of Custody
• Samples should arrive at the laboratory in COC packaging with
intact seals.
• Verify the integrity of the COC seals. If seals are broken or
tampered with, notify the supervisor immediately.
• Document sample receipt, including date, time, and personnel
initials, in the COC log.
• Assign a unique laboratory accession number to each sample for
tracking purposes.
3.2 Sample Preparation
• Homogenize the meconium sample thoroughly to ensure
uniformity.
• Weigh approximately 1 gram of the homogenized sample into a
clean, labeled centrifuge tube.
• Add 10 mL of methanol or appropriate extraction solvent.
• Vortex the mixture for 10 minutes to ensure proper mixing.
• Centrifuge at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes to separate the solid and
liquid phases.
• Decant the supernatant into a clean, labeled GC-MS or LC-MS
vial.
3.3 Analytical Instrumentation
• Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) or Liquid
Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS) will be used for
analysis.
• Ensure the instruments are calibrated using appropriate
standards for amphetamines, methamphetamine, MDMA, and any
other ATS of interest.
• Analyze QC samples (negative and positive controls) to confirm
the accuracy and precision of the method.
3.4 Sample Analysis
• Inject the prepared sample into the GC-MS or LC-MS system.
• Set the instrument to monitor specific mass-to-charge (m/z) ions
corresponding to the ATS analytes.
• Use the established retention times or ion transition parameters to
identify ATS.
• Quantify the concentration of each ATS using the calibration curve
generated from standard samples.
3.5 Quality Control
• Analyze QC samples with each batch of meconium samples.
• Positive Control: ATS-spiked meconium to confirm accuracy.
• Negative Control: Drug-free meconium to ensure no cross-
contamination.
• Ensure that the QC results fall within the acceptable limits
established during method validation.
3.6 Reporting Results
• Review the chromatograms and ensure that all peaks
corresponding to ATS are correctly identified and quantified.
• Verify that the internal controls and standards meet the
acceptance criteria.
• Record the results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
with appropriate accession numbers.
• Report any positive results to the appropriate authorities following
the laboratory's reporting procedures.
3.7 Documentation
• Maintain comprehensive records of all steps from sample receipt
to result reporting in the COC log.
• Document each stage of the analysis process, including sample
preparation, instrument calibration, and QC results.
• Store all logs and records securely to ensure confidentiality and
traceability.
3.8 Procedure for Deviations
• If there are any deviations from the SOP, document the deviation,
include a rationale for it, and notify the supervisor immediately.
• Conduct an investigation for the deviation and take corrective
actions to prevent future occurrences.

procedures.

1. REVIEW
This SOP must be reviewed and updated annually or whenever there
are significant changes in the method or regulatory requirements.
