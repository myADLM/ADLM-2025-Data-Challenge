Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Amphetamine-Type
Stimulants Confirmation in Meconium
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the procedure for the analytical phase of
generating results for amphetamine-type stimulants (ATS)
confirmation in meconium samples. It includes protocols for sample
preparation, instrumental analysis, quality control, and result
reporting. This ensures reliable and consistent identification and
quantification of amphetamine-type stimulants, safeguarding the
accuracy and validity of laboratory data.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for executing
and documenting the procedure.
• It is the responsibility of supervisors to ensure adherence to the
SOP and to address any issues that arise during the process.
1. PRINCIPLE AND SCOPE
This procedure uses liquid chromatography-tandem mass
spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) for the confirmation of amphetamine-type
stimulants in meconium samples.
Amphetamine-type stimulants include, but are not limited to:
• Amphetamine
• Methamphetamine
• MDMA (Ecstasy)
• MDA (3,4-Methylenedioxyamphetamine)
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen:
• Meconium sample of at least 3 grams.
• Collect the specimen in a sterile, leak-proof container and ensure
it is clearly labeled with patient identification, collection date, and
time.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens in non-standard containers.
• Specimens with incomplete identification.
• Specimens stored beyond the stability period or with signs of
contamination.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• LC-MS/MS system
• Centrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Analytical balance
• Pipettes and tips
• QC standards - blank, low, medium, and high
• MeOH/Acetonitrile (HPLC grade)
• Formic acid
• Solid-phase extraction (SPE) cartridges
• Nitrogen evaporator
1. CALIBRATION AND QC STANDARDS
• Prepare calibration standards and QC samples using certified
reference materials.
• Calibration standards should cover the analytical range with at
least 5 points.
• QC samples (low, medium, and high) must be included in each
analytical batch.
1. PROCEDURE
Sample Preparation:
1. Weigh 1 g of homogenized meconium into a clean, labeled
tube.
2. Add 4 mL of methanol/acetonitrile (1:1) and vortex for 2
minutes.
3. Centrifuge the tube at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes.
4. Transfer the clear supernatant to a new tube.
5. Add 2 mL of formic acid (0.1%) in water.
6. Load the prepared sample onto a conditioned SPE cartridge.
7. Wash the cartridge with 1 mL of methanol/water (10:90)
solution.
8. Elute the analytes with 1 mL of methanol.
9. Evaporate the eluate under nitrogen at 40°C.
10. Reconstitute the residue with 200 µL of mobile phase and
vortex briefly.
LC-MS/MS Analysis:
1. Inject 10 µL of the reconstituted sample onto the LC-MS/MS.
2. Use the following LC conditions:
◦ Mobile Phase: A = 0.1% formic acid in water, B = 0.1%
formic acid in acetonitrile.
◦ Gradient: Start at 10% B, ramp to 90% B over 5 minutes,
hold for 2 minutes, return to 10% B, re-equilibrate for 3
minutes.
◦ Flow rate: 0.3 mL/min.
◦ Column: C18, 100 x 2.1 mm, 2.6 µm.
3. Monitor the following transitions by MS:
◦ Amphetamine: m/z 136→91
◦ Methamphetamine: m/z 150→91
◦ MDMA: m/z 194→163
◦ MDA: m/z 180→163
Quality Control:
1. Analyze QC samples alongside patient specimens.
2. QC results should fall within the established acceptance
criteria.
3. Reanalyze any batch that fails QC requirements.
4. REPORTING RESULTS
• Data Review: Technologists must review raw data for each batch
to ensure no abnormalities are present.
• Calculation: Quantitate the results using the calibration curve.
• Verification: Supervisor reviews and verifies results for accuracy
and compliance with SOP.
• Documentation: Document all observations, QC results,
instrument conditions, and corrective actions taken in a
comprehensive log.
Reporting Format:
• Report results in ng/g units.
• Highlight and comment on any results that exceed the established
reference limits.
• Incorporate QC data and verification signatures on the final
report.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Negative: Below the lower limit of quantitation.
• Positive: Above the threshold concentration established by
regulatory bodies or clinical guidelines.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Matrix effects: Ensure proper matrix matched calibrators are used
to mitigate potential interferences.
• Sensitivity: The procedure's sensitivity must be validated against
established guidelines.

By adhering to this SOP, the laboratory ensures the accurate and
reliable confirmation of amphetamine-type stimulants in meconium
samples while maintaining compliance with regulatory standards.
