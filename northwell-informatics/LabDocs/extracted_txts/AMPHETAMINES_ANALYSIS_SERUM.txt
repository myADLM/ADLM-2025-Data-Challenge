Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Title: Amphetamines Analysis
in Serum Effective Date: [Enter Date] Review Date: [Enter Date]
Approved By: [Enter Approver Name] Version: 1.0
1. PURPOSE To establish a standardized procedure for the
analysis of amphetamines in serum samples, ensuring accurate
and precise results.
2. SCOPE This procedure is applicable to the analysis of serum
samples collected from patients for the detection and
quantification of amphetamines.
3. RESPONSIBILITY Qualified laboratory personnel are
responsible for performing the analysis in accordance with this
SOP and for documenting all activities. It is the responsibility of
the laboratory supervisor to ensure compliance with the
protocol and to address any issues that arise during the
process.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Serum
• Collection Container: Red-top tube (no anticoagulants) or serum
separator tube (SST)
• Volume: Minimum 2 mL of serum
• Stability: Serum specimens should be separated from cells within
2 hours of collection. Store at 2-8°C if analysis is to be performed
within 7 days; otherwise, store at -20°C for long-term storage.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Gas Chromatograph-Mass Spectrometer (GC-MS) or Liquid
Chromatograph-Mass Spectrometer (LC-MS)
• Calibrated analytical balance
• Refrigerated centrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Volumetric flasks, pipettes, and microcentrifuge tubes
• Internal standards (deuterated amphetamines recommended)
• Calibration standards for amphetamines
• Extracting solvents (e.g., ethyl acetate, hexane)
• Reconstitution solvent (e.g., methanol)
• Quality control materials (positive and negative controls)
• Lab consumables (e.g., gloves, pipette tips)
1. PROCEDURE
6.1. Sample Preparation
• Centrifuge the serum sample at 3000 RPM for 10 minutes at 4°C
to separate the serum from cells.
• Transfer the supernatant to a clean microcentrifuge tube.
• Add an appropriate amount of internal standard to the serum
sample.
• Vortex the sample for 30 seconds to mix thoroughly.
6.2. Extraction
• Add the selected extracting solvent to the serum sample in a 1:1
ratio.
• Vortex for 1 minute to ensure thorough mixing.
• Centrifuge the sample at 3000 RPM for 10 minutes at 4°C to
separate the organic phase.
• Carefully transfer the organic phase to a clean microcentrifuge
tube without disturbing the aqueous layer.
• Evaporate the organic solvent under nitrogen at room
temperature.
• Reconstitute the dried extract in an appropriate reconstitution
solvent (e.g., methanol).
6.3. Instrument Setup and Calibration
• Set up the GC-MS or LC-MS according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
• Ensure that the instrument is calibrated using appropriate
calibration standards for amphetamines.
• Perform blank runs to check for any carryover or contamination.
6.4. Analysis
• Inject an aliquot (e.g., 1 µL for GC-MS or 10 µL for LC-MS) of the
reconstituted sample into the instrument.
• Use a validated method for the detection and quantification of
amphetamines.
• Ensure that each batch of samples includes at least one positive
control, one negative control, and one blank.
• Run quality controls to ensure accuracy and precision.
6.5. Reporting Results
• Review the chromatograms and mass spectra for each sample.
• Quantify the concentration of amphetamines in the sample using
the calibration curve generated from the standards.
• Record the results in the laboratory information system (LIS).
• Ensure that results falling outside the reference range or those
requiring critical attention are flagged and reported according to
laboratory guidelines.
1. QUALITY CONTROL AND TROUBLESHOOTING
• Utilize appropriate controls, including positive and negative
controls, for each batch of samples.
• Repeat analysis for any samples or controls that fail to meet
acceptance criteria.
• Document any deviations from the procedure and corrective
actions taken.
• Perform regular maintenance and calibration of instruments as
per the manufacturer's recommendations.
1. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS
• Follow standard laboratory safety protocols, including the use of
personal protective equipment (PPE).
• Handle all reagents, solvents, and biohazardous materials
according to safety guidelines.
• Dispose of waste materials in accordance with local regulations
and laboratory policies.

1. REVIEW AND APPROVAL This SOP is subject to periodic
review and may be updated as necessary. Any changes to the
procedure must be approved by the laboratory supervisor or
designated authority.
