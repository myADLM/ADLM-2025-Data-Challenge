SOP for Analyses of AMPHETAMINES CONFIRMATION, CHAIN
OF CUSTODY, RANDOM, URINE
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for the confirmation analysis of
amphetamines in urine samples received through chain of custody
for random drug testing. This protocol ensures the accurate and
reliable analysis of amphetamines, maintaining the integrity of the
chain of custody.
Responsibility:
• Laboratory personnel are responsible for following this SOP to
ensure the accuracy and reliability of results.
• Supervisory personnel must ensure that all staff are trained on
this SOP and that adherence is monitored and documented.
1. DEFINITIONS
Chain of Custody (CoC): A process that tracks the movement and
location of the sample from the point of collection through analysis to
final disposition.
Amphetamines: A class of stimulant drugs including amphetamine,
methamphetamine, and other related compounds.
1. EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS
• Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) or Liquid
Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)
• Analytical balance
• Centrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Micropipettes
• Urine sample containers
• Chain of Custody forms
• Gloves, lab coats, and other personal protective equipment (PPE)
• Certified reference materials
• Extraction solvents (e.g., methanol, acetonitrile)
• Derivatization reagents (if applicable)
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen Types: 10 mL of urine collected under chain of custody
procedures.
Storage Conditions:
• Freshly voided urine can be stored at 2-8°C and should be
analyzed within 72 hours.
• For longer storage, urine samples can be frozen at -20°C and
should be thawed at room temperature prior to analysis.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Chain of Custody
1. Receipt and Documentation:
◦ Upon receiving the urine sample, verify the integrity and
label of the specimen against the Chain of Custody form.
◦ Document the receipt of the sample on the CoC form,
including date, time, and condition of the specimen.
◦ Ensure that the Chain of Custody is maintained throughout
the analysis process.
B. Sample Preparation and Extraction:
1. Label Preparation:
◦ Assign a unique laboratory identifier to the sample and
record relevant information in the laboratory information
management system (LIMS).
2. Preparation:
◦ Aliquot 5 mL of the urine sample into a clean extraction
tube.
◦ Add internal standard to each sample aliquot for
quantification purposes.
3. Extraction:
◦ Vortex the sample to mix thoroughly.
◦ Centrifuge the sample at 3000 RPM for 10 minutes.
◦ Carefully collect the supernatant without disturbing the
pellet.
◦ Transfer the supernatant to a clean tube for further analysis.
C. Instrumental Analysis:
1. Instrument Calibration:
◦ Calibrate the GC-MS or LC-MS/MS according to the
manufacturer’s instructions using certified reference
materials of amphetamines.
◦ Ensure that the calibration curve covers the expected
concentration range of the samples.
2. Analysis:
◦ Inject the prepared sample extract into the GC-MS or LC-
MS/MS.
◦ Use the appropriate method parameters to ensure optimal
separation and detection of amphetamines.
◦ Run controls and calibrators to ensure the accuracy of the
analysis.
D. Data Interpretation and Reporting:
1. Data Analysis:
◦ Analyze the chromatographic data to identify and quantify
amphetamines.
◦ Compare the sample results to the calibration curve and
quality control samples.
2. Result Interpretation:
◦ Interpret the chromatographic peaks and mass spectra to
confirm the presence of specific amphetamines.
◦ Ensure that the results meet all quality control criteria prior
to reporting.
3. Reporting:
◦ Report positive or negative results based on the quantitation
and confirmation criteria.
◦ Document the results in the LIMS and provide a signed
Chain of Custody report.
◦ Maintain a copy of the CoC form and analytical results for
record-keeping.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
5. Internal Controls:
◦ Include blank, negative, and positive controls in each batch
of samples analyzed.
◦ Run quality control samples with each batch to ensure the
accuracy and precision of the analysis.
6. Proficiency Testing:
◦ Participate in external proficiency testing programs to
validate method performance and accuracy.
7. SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS
8. Handling and Disposal:
◦ Wear appropriate PPE when handling urine samples and
hazardous chemicals.
◦ Dispose of waste solvents, reagents, and urine samples
according to laboratory safety protocols.
9. Emergency Procedures:
◦ Follow laboratory safety procedures for chemical spills,
accidental exposure, and other emergencies.
