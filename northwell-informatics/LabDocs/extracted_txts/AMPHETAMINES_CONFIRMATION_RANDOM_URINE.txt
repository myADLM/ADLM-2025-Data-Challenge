Standard Operating Procedure ANALYTICAL PHASE –
AMPHETAMINES CONFIRMATION, RANDOM, URINE
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized protocol to confirm the presence of
amphetamines in random urine specimens using a reliable and
validated analytical method.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of laboratory personnel to follow this protocol
and document all steps accurately. Supervisors must ensure that all
staff are trained and competent in performing amphetamines
confirmation analysis.
2. DEFINITIONS
Amphetamines: A class of psycho-stimulant drugs that includes
amphetamine, methamphetamine, MDA, and MDMA.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• Gas Chromatograph-Mass Spectrometer (GC-MS) or Liquid
Chromatograph-Mass Spectrometer (LC-MS/MS)
• Certified reference materials for amphetamine,
methamphetamine, MDA, MDMA, and internal standards
• Urine sample collection cups
• Calibrated pipettes
• Volumetric flasks
• Extraction solvents (e.g., methanol, acetonitrile)
• Reagent-grade chemicals (e.g., hydrochloric acid, sodium
hydroxide)
• Solid-phase extraction (SPE) cartridges
• Centrifuge and microcentrifuge tubes
• Calibration and quality control (QC) samples
4. PROCEDURE
4.1 Sample Preparation
Acceptable Specimens:
• Random urine samples collected using a urine collection cup.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Samples without proper labeling (patient ID, collection date/time).
• Samples with evidence of tampering.
• Samples not stored properly (e.g., not refrigerated if stored).
4.2 Sample Processing
1. Receipt and Accessioning:
◦ Verify sample labeling and accompanying documentation.
◦ Record sample information in the laboratory information
system (LIS) ensuring traceability.
2. Aliquot Preparation:
◦ Mix the urine sample thoroughly.
◦ Aliquot an appropriate volume (e.g., 5 mL) of the urine
sample into a labeled centrifuge tube.
3. Enzymatic Hydrolysis (if required):
◦ Add an appropriate volume of beta-glucuronidase enzyme
to hydrolyze any glucuronide conjugates.
◦ Incubate the sample at the required temperature and time
as specified by the enzyme manufacturer's instructions.
4. Extraction:
◦ Condition the SPE cartridge with methanol followed by
water.
◦ Load the urine sample onto the SPE cartridge.
◦ Wash the cartridge with water and then a wash solution
(e.g., 5% methanol in water).
◦ Elute the analytes from the cartridge using an appropriate
solvent (e.g., methanol).
◦ Evaporate the eluent to dryness under nitrogen in a heating
block set at 40°C.
5. Derivatization (if required for GC-MS):
◦ Reconstitute the dried sample in a derivatization reagent.
◦ Heat the sample as specified in the derivatization protocol.
4.3 Analytical Instrumentation
1. Calibration:
◦ Prepare calibration standards using certified reference
materials at concentrations covering the expected range in
urine specimens.
◦ Inject each calibration standard into the instrument to
generate a calibration curve.
2. Quality Control:
◦ Prepare and analyze QC samples (at least one negative,
one low positive, and one high positive control) with each
assay batch.
◦ Ensure QC results are within acceptable ranges before
proceeding with sample analysis.
3. Sample Analysis:
◦ Inject the prepared samples into the GC-MS or LC-MS/MS
according to the validated method.
◦ Monitor specific ions or mass transitions for amphetamines
and internal standards.
◦ Analyze data to determine the presence and concentration
of amphetamines in each sample.
4.4 Data Analysis and Reporting
1. Data Review:
◦ Review chromatograms and mass spectra for each sample.
◦ Ensure that internal standard peak areas are within the
expected range.
◦ Verify the presence of target compounds based on retention
time and ion ratios.
2. Quantification:
◦ Calculate the concentration of amphetamines in the urine
samples using the calibration curve.
◦ Apply appropriate units (e.g., ng/mL or µg/mL) to the results.
3. Result Validation:
◦ Confirm consistency between chromatographic and mass
spectral data.
◦ Ensure all QC criteria are met.
◦ Perform a technical review of results including the
confirmation by a secondary qualified personnel if required.
4. Reporting:
◦ Enter confirmed results into the LIS.
◦ Generate final reports formatted according to laboratory
guidelines.
◦ Report out any critical values following established
laboratory protocols.
4.5 Documentation
• Maintain records of all sample preparation, extraction, analysis,
and data review steps.
• Document all calibration, QC, and maintenance activities in the
respective logs.
5. REFERENCES
• Relevant SOPs for instrument operation (GC-MS/LC-MS/MS)
• Method validation and verification documents
• Manufacturer’s instructions for reagents and instruments
• CLIA guidelines for laboratory testing
6. QUALITY ASSURANCE
Internal Quality Control:
• Regularly verify instrument calibration.
• Conduct proficiency testing and participate in inter-laboratory
comparisons.
• Implement corrective actions for any non-conformance identified
during analysis.
7. SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS
• Use personal protective equipment (PPE) including lab coat,
gloves and safety glasses.
• Follow laboratory safety protocols for handling chemicals and
biological specimens.
• Ensure proper waste disposal procedures for chemical and
biological waste.
This SOP should be reviewed and updated periodically to ensure
compliance with current standards and advancements in analytical
techniques.
