Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase for Generating Results for Amphetamines in
Umbilical Cord Tissue
1. PURPOSE
To provide step-by-step instructions for the analysis of amphetamines
in umbilical cord tissue via immunoassay and confirmatory LC-MS/
MS method.
Responsibility: The trained laboratory personnel are responsible for
conducting the analysis, adhering to the protocol, and ensuring the
accuracy of the generated results. Supervisors must ensure all steps
are followed and documented.
1. SCOPE
The protocol covers the analytical steps required for the detection
and quantification of amphetamines in umbilical cord tissue
specimens that have been collected, received, and accessioned.
1. DEFINITIONS
Amphetamines: Refer to a class of stimulants including
amphetamine, methamphetamine, and their derivatives.
Immunoassay: A biochemical test that measures the presence or
concentration of a substance using the reaction of an antibody or
antibodies to its antigen. LC-MS/MS: Liquid Chromatography with
tandem Mass Spectrometry, an analytical chemistry technique used
to identify substances within a sample. 4. PROCEDURE
A. Reagents and Supplies
Extraction buffer Calibrators and controls (negative and positive
controls) Pre-packed extraction columns Mobile phase solvents
Internal standards for LC-MS/MS analysis High purity water Certified
amphetamines reference materials
B. Equipment
Centrifuge Microbalance Homogenizer Vortex mixer Incubator High-
performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) system Tandem Mass
Spectrometer (MS/MS) Data analysis software
C. Sample Preparation
1. Homogenization
a) Weigh approximately 1 g of umbilical cord tissue and transfer it
into a homogenization tube. b) Add 5 mL of extraction buffer into the
tube. c) Homogenize the tissue using the homogenizer until a uniform
mixture is obtained.
1. Extraction
a) Centrifuge the homogenized mixture at 3,000 rpm for 10 minutes.
b) Transfer the supernatant into a clean tube. c) Apply the
supernatant to pre-packed extraction columns according to
manufacturer’s instructions.
1. Elution
a) Elute the sample from the extraction column using high purity
water and solvents. b) Collect the eluate in a clean tube.
1. Drying and Reconstitution
a) Dry the eluate under nitrogen at room temperature. b) Reconstitute
the dried sample in 200 μL of the mobile phase mixture.
D. Immunoassay Screening
1. Immunoassay Test
a) Set up the immunoassay analyzer according to manufacturer’s
instructions. b) Load the reconstituted sample and controls onto the
immunoassay analyzer. c) Run the assay and record the results.
E. Confirmatory LC-MS/MS Analysis
1. Sample Injection and Chromatographic Separation
a) Set up the HPLC system with appropriate column and mobile
phase. b) Inject 50 μL of the reconstituted sample into the HPLC
system. c) Perform chromatographic separation as per validated
method.
1. Mass Spectrometric Detection
a) Set up the MS/MS with the appropriate ionization source. b)
Identify and quantify amphetamines using predefined multiple
reaction monitoring (MRM) transitions.
1. Data Analysis
a) Analyze the chromatograms and the mass spectra using the data
analysis software. b) Confirm the presence of amphetamines by
comparing retention times and mass spectra to those of certified
reference materials. c) Quantify the concentration of amphetamines
using a calibration curve prepared from certified amphetamines
standards.
F. Quality Control
1. Include negative and positive controls with each batch of
samples analyzed.
2. Verify the accuracy and precision of the assay by ensuring
controls fall within the specified range.
3. Implement corrective actions if QC results are outside the
acceptable limits.
G. Reporting Results
1. Review the data and ensure all QC criteria are met.
2. Document the results in the laboratory information system
(LIS).
3. Report the final results to the requesting physician or
authorized healthcare provider.
