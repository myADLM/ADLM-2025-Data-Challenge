Standard Operating Procedure for the Analytical Phase of Generating
Results for Amphetamines in Urine
1. PURPOSE
This SOP provides detailed instructions on the analytical procedures
required to accurately generate and document results for
amphetamines in urine specimens in a CLIA-certified laboratory.
Responsibility:
Designated staff are responsible for performing the analysis of urine
specimens for amphetamines following this SOP. Supervisors are
responsible for overseeing the process and ensuring adherence to
the procedures.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Preferred/acceptable specimens:
• 10 mL of freshly voided urine sent to the laboratory within 6 hours
of collection.
• BD Vacutainer Urinalysis Preservative Conical Urine tube.
Specimens in these tubes are stable for up to 72 hours at 4-25°C
with an ideal volume of 7-9 mL.
Unacceptable specimens:
• Specimens arriving in the laboratory greater than 6 hours after
collection without preserver tubes, or greater than 72 hours with
preserver tubes.
• Specimens arriving in the laboratory without collection date/time
indicated on the sample container or requisition.
Note: If the sample has been refrigerated, bring it to room
temperature prior to analysis.
1. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• Immunoassay test kits or GC-MS/HPLC equipment calibrated for
amphetamines detection.
• Appropriate quality control materials for calibration verification.
• Urinalysis containers, transfer pipettes, gloves, and other lab
safety equipment.
• Record logs for documentation.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation for Analysis:
1. Verify specimen integrity and ensure it is within the acceptable
timeframe.
2. Label specimen container with patient information and date/
time of collection.
3. Ensure all necessary reagents and equipment calibration are
completed before starting the assay.
B. Immunoassay Screening (if applicable):
1. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for the immunoassay kit.
2. Completely immerse the test strip or load the urine sample into
automated analyzers.
3. Start the timer as per the kit’s requirement.
4. Read and document results according to the set time intervals.
C. Confirmatory Testing (GC-MS/HPLC):
1. Pre-treat samples when necessary (e.g., hydrolysis).
2. Set up GC-MS/HPLC system according to manufacturer’s
guidelines.
3. Load the urine sample into the system.
4. Perform the analysis according to the instrument’s protocol.
5. Verify chromatograms and spectroscopic results for
amphetamines and their metabolites.
6. Document and interpret results.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
A. Initial Setup:
1. Run quality control samples at different levels (negative and
positive) to ensure the accuracy of the assay.
2. Document and check results against expected values.
B. Continuous Quality Control:
1. Run QC samples with each batch of patient specimens.
2. If QC fails, do not proceed with patient samples until corrective
actions are taken and QA results are within acceptable ranges.
3. REPORTING RESULTS
A. Documentation:
1. Record initial screening results and confirmatory results in the
laboratory information system (LIS).
2. Include the date, time, analyst’s initials, QC status, and any
deviations or corrective actions taken.
3. Ensure results are reviewed and verified by the technologist
before final reporting.
B. Results Interpretation:
1. Report any positive results from screening followed by
confirmatory results from GC-MS/HPLC.
2. If the confirmatory test does not detect amphetamines after a
positive immunoassay screening, document as “negative by
confirmatory testing.”
C. Reporting to Clinicians:
1. Follow site-specific guidelines for reporting amphetamines
results.
2. Critical results must be communicated immediately to the
relevant clinician.
3. REFERENCES
Include references to relevant product inserts, equipment manuals,
and any scientific literature necessary for the complete understanding
of the testing method and interpretation of results.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to product inserts and equipment manuals for limitations
related to reagent and instrument sensitivity, specificity, potential
interferences, as well as storage and handling of specimens and
reagents.
This completes the analytical phase procedures for generating
results for amphetamines in urine. Ensure all steps are carried out
according to the above guidelines to maintain accuracy and reliability
of test results.
