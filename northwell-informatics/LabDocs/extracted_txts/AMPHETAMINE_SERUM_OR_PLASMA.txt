Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
1. PURPOSE To provide a standardized procedure for the
analysis of amphetamine in serum or plasma samples. This
SOP ensures the accuracy and reliability of the results, and
adherence to the laboratory quality standards.
Responsibility: Laboratory technologists are responsible for
performing the analysis of amphetamine in serum or plasma samples
according to this SOP. Supervisors are responsible for overseeing the
correct implementation of the procedure and addressing any
discrepancies or issues.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen:
• Preferred: Serum or plasma collected in a red-top tube (without
anticoagulant) or green-top tube with lithium heparin.
• Unacceptable: Samples collected in tubes containing EDTA,
citrate, or fluoride; hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
Specimen Handling:
• Ensure proper labeling of the specimen with patient identification,
collection date/time.
• If serum or plasma is separated from whole blood, it must be
done within 2 hours of collection. Store separated serum/plasma
at 2-8°C if analysis cannot be performed immediately.
Specimen Stability:
• Serum/plasma samples are stable for up to 7 days at 2-8°C.
• For longer storage, specimens can be frozen at -20°C and are
stable for up to 3 months.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)
system.
• Calibrators and controls for amphetamine analysis.
• Mobile phase solvents
• Sample preparation materials (e.g., centrifuge, pipettes, extraction
solvents)
• Notebooks/logs for documentation
1. PROCEDURE
Sample Preparation:
1. Allow serum or plasma samples to reach room temperature if
previously refrigerated or frozen.
2. Centrifuge samples at 1500-2000g for 10 minutes to ensure
separation of any particulate matter.
3. Transfer clear serum/plasma into appropriately labeled tubes
for analysis.
Quality Control:
1. Run calibrators and controls at the beginning of each batch of
samples to ensure instrument calibration and performance.
2. Verify that the control values are within acceptable limits
(provided by the manufacturer or determined in the lab).
3. Document control results in the appropriate logbooks.
Sample Analysis:
1. Load the prepared serum/plasma samples, calibrators, and
controls into the LC-MS/MS system.
2. Follow the specific LC-MS/MS system and reagent kit
instructions for setting up the analysis run (refer to instrument
manual and reagent insert).
3. Allow the system to run and complete the analysis.
4. Retrieve data and review chromatograms to ensure proper
peak identification and quantitation.
5. If there are any discrepancies or unusual results, rerun the
sample or perform necessary troubleshooting steps (refer to
instrument manual for troubleshooting).
6. REPORTING RESULTS
7. Analyze the LC-MS/MS output to verify the presence and
concentration of amphetamine in each sample.
8. Compare results against established reference intervals and
document findings.
9. Enter verified results into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
10. Report critical results promptly according to laboratory policy
(including notifying healthcare providers as necessary).
Reference Intervals:
• Expected/normal range: Not detectable
• Positive (presence of amphetamine): greater than 20 ng/mL
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS Refer to reagent kit inserts for specific
limitations of the method. Known interference factors include
hemolysis, lipemia, and icterus, which may affect the accuracy
of the test.

1. ADDITIONAL NOTES
• Ensure adherence to all safety protocols when handling biological
specimens and reagents.
• Maintain thorough documentation of all steps, controls, and
results as per laboratory policy.
