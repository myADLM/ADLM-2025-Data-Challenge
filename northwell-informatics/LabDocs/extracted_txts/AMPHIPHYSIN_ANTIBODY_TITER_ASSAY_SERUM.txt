Standard Operating Procedure
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the steps and procedures for
the analytical phase of generating results for the Amphiphysin
Antibody Titer Assay using serum samples. This assay is utilized to
measure the titers of Amphiphysin antibodies in serum for the
diagnosis and monitoring of autoimmune disorders.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel conducting the
Amphiphysin Antibody Titer Assay in the clinical laboratory setting.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
Laboratory technologists are responsible for performing the analysis
according to this SOP. Supervisors are responsible for ensuring that
personnel are trained and competent in the procedures.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
4.1 Specimen Collection
• Specimen Type: Serum
• Preferred Collection Container: 5 mL red-top tube (serum
separator tube is also acceptable).
4.2 Specimen Handling and Storage
• After collection, allow the blood to clot by leaving it undisturbed at
room temperature for 30 minutes.
• Centrifuge the collection tubes at 1500 x g for 10 minutes to
separate the serum.
• Aliquot the serum into labeled, screw-cap tubes.
• Store serum aliquots at 2-8°C if assay will be performed within 48
hours; for longer storage, store aliquots at -20°C or lower.
Note: Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.

6. PROCEDURE
6.1 Plate Preparation
1. Bring all reagents and specimens to room temperature before
use.
2. Prepare the required number of microwells from the ELISA kit.
6.2 Assay Procedure
1. Sample and Control Addition:
◦ Add 100 μL of calibrators, controls, and patient serum
samples into the designated microwells.
◦ Include wells for the blank, negative control, and positive
control as recommended by the kit insert.
◦ Cover the plate and incubate at 37°C for 60 minutes.
2. Washing:
◦ After incubation, aspirate the contents of the wells.
◦ Wash each well 5 times with 300 μL of wash buffer.
◦ Tap the plate on absorbent paper to remove residual wash
buffer.
3. Conjugate Addition:
◦ Add 100 μL of enzyme conjugate into each well.
◦ Cover the plate and incubate at 37°C for 30 minutes.
4. Washing:
◦ Repeat the washing step as outlined in section 6.2.2.
5. Substrate Addition:
◦ Add 100 μL of substrate solution to each well.
◦ Incubate at room temperature for 15 minutes in the dark.
6. Stopping the Reaction:
◦ Add 100 μL of stop solution to each well.
◦ Tap the sides of the plate gently to mix.
7. Reading the Plate:
◦ Read the absorbance of each well at 450 nm using a
microplate reader within 30 minutes of adding the stop
solution.
6.3 Calculation of Results
1. Calculate the mean absorbance for each set of calibrators,
controls, and patient samples.
2. Generate a standard curve by plotting the mean absorbance of
each calibrator against its corresponding concentration.
3. Determine the antibody titer of each sample from the standard
curve using the fitted curve equation.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
7.1 Quality Control Materials
• Run both positive and negative controls with each assay to
ensure the validity of the results.
• Ensure that the controls fall within the established quality control
range.
7.2 Reagent Lot Validation
• New reagent lots must be validated before clinical use by running
known positive and negative samples to ensure accurate results.
7.3 Equipment Calibration
• The microplate reader should be calibrated monthly or as per the
manufacturer's recommendation to ensure accurate readings.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Integrity of Samples:
◦ Verify that serum samples are free of hemolysis, lipemia, or
significant turbidity before analysis.
• Result Interpretation:
◦ Results should be interpreted relative to the established cut-off
value for positive and negative results in the assay.
◦ Report results within the validated range of the calibration
curve.
• Documentation:
◦ Record assay details, including control values, and any
deviations in the corresponding laboratory information system
(LIS).
9. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Reference ranges for Amphiphysin antibody titers should be
determined as per the kit insert and in-house validation studies:
◦ Negative: Below established cutoff
◦ Positive: Above established cutoff
10. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Potential for cross-reactivity with other antibodies should be
considered; refer to the manufacturer's instructions for cross-
reactivity data.
• Results should be used in conjunction with clinical findings and
not as sole criteria for diagnosis.
