Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) TITLE: Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Amphiphysin Antibody Titer Assay, Spinal
Fluid
1. PURPOSE: To outline the protocol for the accurate analysis and
reporting of Amphiphysin Antibody Titer in spinal fluid
specimens in accordance with CLIA regulations.
2. SCOPE: This procedure applies to laboratory staff responsible
for the analysis of Amphiphysin Antibody Titer assays using
spinal fluid specimens.
3. RESPONSIBILITY: Technical staff are responsible for
performing the assay steps, analyzing data, and documenting
results. Supervisory staff are responsible for reviewing results
and ensuring compliance with this SOP.
4. PROCEDURE:
4.1 Pre-analytical Considerations:
• Ensure that spinal fluid specimens have been properly collected,
received, and accessioned as per the laboratory guidelines.
• Verify that specimens are labeled correctly with the patient’s
identification details.
• Spinal fluid specimens must be stored at 2-8°C if not analyzed
immediately.
4.2 Reagents and Supplies:
• Amphiphysin Antibody Titer Assay Kit
• Microtiter plates
• Pipettes and tips
• Wash buffer
• Diluent buffer
• Positive and negative controls
• Amphiphysin antibody standards
• Substrate solution
• Stop solution
• Plate reader or ELISA reader
• Timer
• Laboratory PPE (gloves, lab coat, safety glasses)
4.3 Equipment Preparation:
• Calibrate the pipettes as per laboratory standards.
• Ensure the plate reader is calibrated and set to the correct
wavelength as specified in the assay kit insert (commonly 450
nm).
• Prepare wash and diluent buffers as per the manufacturer’s
instructions.
4.4 Assay Procedure:
1. Equilibrate all reagents, specimens, and controls to room
temperature prior to starting the assay.
2. Label all microtiter plate wells for standards, controls, and
patient samples.
3. Pipette the appropriate volume of standards, controls, and
spinal fluid specimens into the designated wells.
◦ Typically, 50 µL per well.
4. Add the specified amount of diluent buffer to each well
containing a standard, control, or specimen.
5. Seal the plate with adhesive foil and incubate at room
temperature for the duration specified in the assay kit
(commonly 1 hour).
6. Wash the wells thoroughly with the prepared wash buffer,
ensuring complete removal of residual reagents.
◦ Perform at least 3 wash cycles.
7. Add the pre-diluted amphiphysin antibody conjugate to each
well.
8. Incubate the plate at room temperature according to the kit
instructions.
9. Wash the wells thoroughly to eliminate unbound conjugate.
10. Add substrate solution to each well and incubate in the dark at
room temperature until color development is complete.
◦ Stop the reaction by adding the stop solution to each well
when the highest standard has developed adequate color.
11. Measure the optical density (OD) of each well using the plate
reader set to the appropriate wavelength.
4.5 Data Analysis:
• Plot the standard curve by plotting the OD values against the
known concentrations of the standards.
• Use the standard curve to calculate the Amphiphysin Antibody
Titer in the spinal fluid specimens.
• Ensure that the values for positive and negative controls fall within
the specified ranges. If not, repeat the assay.
4.6 Quality Control:
• Include at least one positive control, one negative control, and a
blank in each assay run.
• Document all control results and ensure they fall within the
acceptable range before validating patient results.
• If QC results are out of range, investigate possible causes,
resolve issues, and repeat the assay.
4.7 Reporting Results:
• Verify and review results before releasing them into the
Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Reference titers should be reported in accordance with the
predetermined laboratory reference range.
• Critical results that fall outside the reference range should be
promptly communicated to the clinician following laboratory
notification procedures.
4.8 Method Limitations:
• Refer to the Amphiphysin Antibody Titer Assay Kit insert for
specific limitations of the reagent and assay.
• Ensure the sample integrity before analysis to avoid false
positives/negatives.

• Temperature logs for equipment
• Calibration records for pipettes and plate readers
• Control result logs for each assay run
• Patient result records
• Deviations and corrective action logs
