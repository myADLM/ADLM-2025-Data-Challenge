STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP)
Title: AMPHOTERICIN B SUSCEPTIBILITY TESTING
1. PURPOSE
To establish a standardized procedure for determining the
susceptibility of fungal isolates to Amphotericin B to guide effective
antimicrobial therapy.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to clinical fungal isolates obtained from
patient specimens and is intended to be used by trained laboratory
personnel to test for susceptibility to Amphotericin B.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of designated laboratory personnel to perform
Amphotericin B susceptibility testing, record results, and ensure data
accuracy and reproducibility. Supervisors must ensure that all
personnel are trained and competent in performing this assay.
4. MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT
Reagents and Supplies:
• Amphotericin B (CAS: 1397-89-3) stock solution
• RPMI-1640 medium with glutamine, without bicarbonate, buffered
to pH 7.0 with MOPS
• Sterile distilled water
• Fungal inoculum prepared to specified density
Equipment:
• Microdilution trays (96-well plates)
• Incubator set at 35 ± 2°C
• Spectrophotometer set at 530 nm
• Microscope
• Sterile pipettes and tips
• Vortex mixer
• Adjustable pipettes
5. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation for Testing:
1. Safety: Ensure appropriate safety measures, including wearing
personal protective equipment (PPE).
2. Preparation of Stock Solution:
◦ Reconstitute Amphotericin B in sterile distilled water to
obtain a stock concentration of 1 mg/mL.
◦ Store stock solution at -20°C in aliquots to avoid repeated
freeze-thaw cycles.
3. Working Solution:
◦ Prepare two-fold dilution series of Amphotericin B in
RPMI-1640 medium.
B) Inoculum Preparation:
1. Isolate Preparation: Subculture the fungal isolate on
appropriate media and incubate at 35 ± 2°C until adequate
growth is observed.
2. Inoculum standardization: Adjust fungal cell density in saline
to achieve a final inoculum concentration of 0.5 x 10^3 to 2.5 x
10^3 CFU/mL using a spectrophotometer (OD range: 0.08 –
0.10 at 530 nm wavelength).
C) Microdilution Method:
1. Plate Layout: Dispense 100 µL of RPMI-1640 medium into all
wells of the microtiter plate.
2. Amphotericin B Dilution:
◦ Add 100 µL of the two-fold dilution series of Amphotericin B
to appropriate rows of wells.
3. Inoculation:
◦ Add 100 µL of standardized fungal inoculum to each well.
◦ Include a growth control without Amphotericin B (RPMI-1640
medium + inoculum).
◦ Include a sterility control (RPMI-1640 medium only).
D) Incubation:
Incubate microdilution trays in a humidified environment at 35 ± 2°C
for 48 hours.
E) Reading Results:
1. Check for Turbidity:
◦ Examine each well for growth (visual turbidity) or no growth.
◦ Measure absorbance at 530 nm as needed to quantitate
results.
2. MIC Determination:
◦ The Minimal Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) is the lowest
concentration of Amphotericin B that inhibits visible growth
of the organism.
◦ Record MIC values and compare to interpretative
breakpoints.
F) Quality Control:
1. Control Strains: Test quality control (QC) fungal isolates with
known MIC ranges concurrently to validate the test run.
2. Documentation: Record test performance details and results
in the assay logbook and laboratory information system.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Record the MIC value and interpret as susceptible,
intermediate, or resistant based on established clinical
breakpoints.
2. Verify the results and report in the laboratory information
management system (LIMS), ensuring clarity and accuracy.
