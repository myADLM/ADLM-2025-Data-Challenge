Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Analytical Phase: Generating Results for Ampicillin, IgE, Serum
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to provide a detailed procedure for
analyzing and generating results for Ampicillin and IgE in serum
samples in a CLIA-certified laboratory, ensuring that results are
accurate, consistent, and timely.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of the trained laboratory technologists and
analysts to follow the procedures outlined in this SOP. The
supervising laboratory manager is responsible for the implementation
and ongoing compliance with this procedure.
2. DEFINITION
Analysis of serum samples involves quantification of Ampicillin and
IgE levels to assist in therapeutic drug monitoring and allergy testing
respectively.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND HANDLING
Specimen Type: Serum Volume: Minimum 1 mL Storage: Serum
samples should be stored at 2-8°C before analysis. If analysis is
delayed for more than 48 hours, samples should be frozen at -20°C.
Unacceptable Conditions:
• Samples that are grossly hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric.
• Samples collected in anticoagulant tubes not specified for serum
collection.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• Ampicillin Analysis:
◦ HPLC System with UV detector
◦ Ampicillin standard solutions
◦ Mobile phase reagents (e.g., phosphate buffer, acetonitrile)
◦ Sample vials and caps
◦ Pipettes and tips
• IgE Analysis:
◦ Immunoassay analyzer (e.g., ELISA, Chemiluminescent
Immunoassay)
◦ IgE calibrators and controls
◦ IgE-specific reagent kit
◦ Microtiter plates (if using ELISA)
◦ Wash buffer
5. PROCEDURE
A) Ampicillin Analysis by HPLC
1. Preparation of Calibration Standards and QC Samples:
◦ Prepare calibration standards of Ampicillin at concentrations
ranging from 0.5 to 100 µg/mL using human serum.
◦ Prepare quality control (QC) samples at low, medium, and
high concentrations within the calibration range.
2. Sample Preparation:
◦ Thaw the serum samples if frozen.
◦ Pipette 0.5 mL of each serum sample into a labeled sample
vial.
◦ Add an appropriate internal standard (if applicable).
◦ Perform protein precipitation or solid-phase extraction
according to the validated protocol.
3. Chromatographic Conditions:
◦ Column: C18 reverse phase column.
◦ Mobile Phase: 80% phosphate buffer (pH 3.0) and 20%
acetonitrile.
◦ Flow Rate: 1.0 mL/min.
◦ Detection Wavelength: 254 nm.
◦ Injection Volume: 10 µL.
4. Instrument Operation:
◦ Calibrate the HPLC instrument using prepared calibration
standards.
◦ Run a blank sample to ensure no carryover.
◦ Inject the prepared samples, calibration standards, and QC
samples into the HPLC system.
◦ Record and analyze chromatograms to quantify Ampicillin
concentration.
5. Data Analysis:
◦ Generate a calibration curve by plotting peak area versus
concentration for Ampicillin standards.
◦ Calculate the Ampicillin concentration in serum samples
using the calibration curve.
◦ Ensure QC samples meet acceptance criteria before
reporting patient results.
B) IgE Analysis by Immunoassay (e.g., ELISA)
1. Preparation of Calibration Standards and QC Samples:
◦ Prepare a series of IgE calibrators according to the
immunoassay kit instructions.
◦ Prepare QC samples at low, medium, and high ranges of
the calibration curve.
2. Sample Preparation:
◦ Thaw serum samples if frozen and allow them to reach
room temperature.
◦ Dilute the serum samples according to the assay kit’s
instructions, if necessary.
3. Assay Procedure:
◦ Add 100 µL of standards, QC samples, and diluted serum
samples into the designated wells of the microtiter plate.
◦ Add 100 µL of enzyme conjugate to each well.
◦ Incubate the plate at room temperature or at specified
temperature and duration as per kit instructions.
◦ Wash the plate with wash buffer to remove unbound
reagents.
◦ Add substrate solution to each well and incubate until color
develops.
◦ Stop the reaction by adding stop solution.
4. Reading and Data Analysis:
◦ Read the absorbance at 450 nm (or the specified
wavelength) using a microplate reader.
◦ Generate a standard curve by plotting absorbance versus
the concentration of IgE calibrators.
◦ Calculate the concentration of IgE in serum samples from
the standard curve.
◦ Verify that QC samples fall within the acceptable range
before reporting patient results.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform internal quality control for each analytical batch by
including QC samples with known concentrations.
• Verify instrument calibration and perform routine maintenance as
needed.
• Document all QC and maintenance activities.
• Ensure that results only from batches where all QC parameters
are within the acceptable range are reported.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results are to be recorded in the laboratory information system
(LIS) and reviewed by the laboratory technologist.
• Any critical values or unexpected results should be communicated
to the requesting clinician immediately.
• Refer to site-specific guidelines for result reporting and
maintaining result confidentiality.
8. REFERENCE INTERVALS:
• Ampicillin: Therapeutic range is generally 10-30 µg/mL, but it
may vary based on patient-specific factors and clinical judgment.
• IgE: Normal range in adults is typically 0-150 IU/mL, but ranges
may differ slightly depending on the assay method used.

• Manufacturer’s instructions for the HPLC system and
immunoassay kits.
• Standard laboratory protocols and guidelines.
• Relevant clinical guidelines for therapeutic drug monitoring and
allergy testing.
10. REVIEW AND REVISION HISTORY:
• This SOP will be reviewed annually or as required.
• Document any changes made during the revision.
