Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Title: Analytical Procedure
for Amylase Measurement in Body Fluids
1. PURPOSE:
This procedure outlines the steps taken by laboratory personnel to
accurately and safely measure amylase levels in body fluids using
appropriate analytical methods.
2. SCOPE:
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel involved in the
measurement of amylase levels in body fluids, including but not
limited to pleural fluid, ascitic fluid, and synovial fluid.
3. RESPONSIBILITY:
• Laboratory Technologists: Perform the analysis following this
SOP and document all results.
• Supervisors: Ensure compliance with the SOP and validate the
quality control results.
4. DEFINITION:
• Amylase: An enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of starch into
sugars.
• Body Fluids: Fluids from human body cavities, including but not
limited to pleural, peritoneal, and synovial fluids.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES:
• Equipment:
◦ Automated biochemistry analyzer
◦ Calibrated pipettes
◦ Centrifuge
◦ Refrigerator (2-8°C)
• Reagents:
◦ Amylase reagent kit (manufacturer-specific)
◦ Control samples at low, medium, and high levels
◦ Calibrators
• Supplies:
◦ Test tubes
◦ Micropipette tips
◦ Latex gloves
◦ Labeling materials
6. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS:
• Preferred/acceptable: Freshly collected body fluids (pleural,
ascitic, synovial) in sterile containers.
• Unacceptable: Specimens that are hemolyzed, clotted, or
improperly labeled.
7. PROCEDURE:
A. Preparation:
1. Inspection and Preparation:
◦ Ensure specimen containers are properly labeled with
patient information and source of body fluid.
◦ Centrifuge the specimen at 2000-3000 rpm for 10 minutes to
obtain a clear supernatant if necessary.
◦ Transfer the supernatant to a clean, labeled test tube for
analysis.
2. Calibration:
◦ Load the calibrators in designated slots on the analyzer.
◦ Perform calibration as per the manufacturer’s instructions
and verify results are within acceptable ranges.
B. Analytical Procedure:
1. Load the amylase reagent kit in the analyzer.
2. Place the prepared specimen in the sample cup/sample holder.
3. Select the 'Amylase Body Fluid' test from the analyzer's menu.
4. Input the identified patient information or scan barcode if
available.
5. Initiate the analysis process on the analyzer.
6. Quality Control:
◦ Run control samples at low, medium, and high levels at the
start of each shift or before running patient samples.
◦ Verify and document that control results are within the
acceptable range before proceeding with patient samples.
C. Post-Analysis:
1. Review the results displayed/printed by the analyzer.
2. Re-run analysis if results fall outside expected ranges or if
quality control fails.
3. In case of repeating analysis, ensure the sample and reagent
integrity are maintained.
8. REPORTING RESULTS:
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS) after
verification.
• Ensure results are communicated to the ordering physician and
included in the patient’s medical record.
Reference Intervals:
• Provide site-specific reference intervals for amylase levels in body
fluids, as established during validation studies.
9. QUALITY CONTROL AND DOCUMENTATION:
• Document control results, patient results, and any corrective
actions taken in the appropriate logs.
• Maintain records of calibrations, reagent lot numbers, and quality
control data.
10. METHODS LIMITATIONS:
• Refer to the manufacturer's insert for limitations specific to the
amylase reagent kit in use.
• Ensure that specimens are free from significant hemolysis or
turbidity which can interfere with results.
