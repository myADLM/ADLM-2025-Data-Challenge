SOP for AMYLASE, ISOENZYMES, SERUM Analysis
1. PURPOSE
To provide detailed instructions on the procedure for the analysis of
amylase and its isoenzymes in serum, ensuring accuracy and
reliability of test results.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the
analysis in accordance with this SOP.
• All staff must identify and report any issues or deviations to a
supervisor promptly.
1. DEFINITION
Amylase is an enzyme that helps in the breakdown of carbohydrates.
Its isoenzymes (mainly P-amylase and S-amylase) are measured to
diagnose and monitor diseases of the pancreas and salivary glands.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Automated Chemistry Analyzer compatible with amylase
isoenzyme determination.
• Calibrators and quality control materials specific to amylase
isoenzymes.
• Specimen collection tubes (serum separator tubes).
• Centrifuge.
1. SPECIMEN
Preferred/acceptable:
• 0.5 mL of serum collected in a serum separator tube (SST).
Unacceptable:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
• Specimens collected in tubes with anticoagulants.
Specimen Stability:
• Serum specimens are stable for up to 7 days when refrigerated at
2-8°C.
• If testing is delayed beyond 7 days, specimens must be frozen at
-20°C and are stable for up to 3 months.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation:
• Ensure that specimens are within the acceptable criteria.
• Centrifuge the SST at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes.
• Transfer the serum into an appropriately labeled secondary
container if required.
B. Calibration and Quality Control:
• Perform calibration of the chemistry analyzer using the specific
amylase calibrators according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
• Analyze control materials (both high and low) before running
patient samples. Ensure that results are within the acceptable
range.
C. Analysis:
• Load patient specimens onto the chemistry analyzer according to
the manufacturer’s procedure.
• Select the amylase and isoenzymes test profile on the analyzer.
• Ensure that all samples are properly identified and matched to the
corresponding patient records.
D. Interpreting Results:
• The analyzer will generate results for total amylase and its
isoenzymes (P-amylase and S-amylase).
• Verify that the results are within the expected range and free from
any analyzer error codes.
E. Criteria for Accepting/Rejecting Runs:
• Invalidate and repeat the analysis if QC results are out of range or
if the analyzer flags any error messages.
• Document any deviations or issues and perform troubleshooting
according to the analyzer’s manual before rerunning samples.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Once results are verified, they are automatically transmitted to the
Laboratory Information System (LIS) for review.
• Ensure that all reporting is consistent with the laboratory’s
guidelines and includes any flagged or abnormal results.
Reference Intervals:
• Total Amylase: 30-110 U/L (may vary based on specific laboratory
reference range).
• P-amylase and S-amylase reference ranges are provided with the
specific assay kit.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• QC specimens should be run with each batch of patient samples.
• Document and address any out-of-range QC results immediately.
• Monthly review and validation of QC and calibration logs.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to the chemistry analyzer and assay kit inserts for specific
limitations related to the amylase and isoenzymes assay.
• Potential interferences from substances such as high bilirubin
levels or certain medications should be considered.

1. REVIEW AND DOCUMENTATION
• Ensure all results, including calibration, QC, and patient data, are
properly recorded and maintained.
• Regularly review and update the SOP to comply with any new
guidelines, equipment, or reagents.
