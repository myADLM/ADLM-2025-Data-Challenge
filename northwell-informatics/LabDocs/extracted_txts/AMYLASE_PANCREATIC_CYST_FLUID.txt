Protocol for the Analytical Phase of Generating Results for
Amylase in Pancreatic Cyst Fluid
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to outline the steps involved in the
analysis of amylase in pancreatic cyst fluid specimens. This protocol
ensures accurate and consistent results while maintaining
compliance with regulatory requirements.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel responsible for
performing the analysis of amylase in pancreatic cyst fluid
specimens.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of designated laboratory personnel to perform
the analysis as described and to ensure all documentation of the
analysis is complete, accurate, and follows the laboratory’s Standard
Operating Procedures.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Acceptable Specimen:
• Pancreatic cyst fluid collected in a sterile container.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens showing signs of contamination.
• Specimens that are not properly labeled or lack collection time/
date information.
• Specimens that show signs of hemolysis or chylous samples.
Specimen Handling and Storage:
• Store at 2-8°C if analysis cannot be performed immediately.
• Ideally, testing should be done within 24 hours of collection. For
longer storage, samples should be frozen at -20°C.
5. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Automated chemistry analyzer (e.g., Roche Cobas, Beckman
Coulter AU, or similar).
• Amylase reagent kit suitable for pancreatic fluid analysis.
• Calibrators and controls (low, medium, and high concentration).
• Deionized water.
• Pipettes and tips.
• Centrifuge.
6. CALIBRATION AND QUALITY CONTROL
Calibration:
• Perform calibration using the amylase reagent kit calibrators
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
• Record calibration data.
• Verify the accuracy of the calibration by running control materials
at low, medium, and high concentration levels.
Quality Control:
• Use commercially available control materials at two different
concentration levels.
• Run controls at the beginning of each shift, with each new reagent
lot, and after major maintenance.
• Document all control results and corrective actions if controls are
out of the acceptable range.
7. PROCEDURE
Sample Preparation:
1. Centrifuge the pancreatic cyst fluid sample at 3000 rpm for 10
minutes to remove any cellular debris.
2. If the supernatant is clear, proceed with the analysis. If cloudy,
repeat centrifugation or perform alternative clarification steps as
appropriate.
Analysis:
1. Load the centrifuged supernatant into the sample cups or tubes
for the automated chemistry analyzer.
2. Load calibrators, controls, and samples onto the instrument
following manufacturer instructions.
3. Select the “Amylase” test parameter and start the analysis.
8. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
Reference Interval:
• The reference interval for amylase in pancreatic cyst fluid must be
established by the laboratory based on literature, reagent
manufacturer guidelines, and clinical consultation.
Reporting Results:
• Results will be automatically transmitted to the LIS (Laboratory
Information System) after analysis.
• Review and verify results in the LIS.
• Report any results with values above the critical or linearity limits
with appropriate comments.
Critical Results:
• Amylase results that fall outside predetermined critical values
should be immediately reported to the requesting physician or
clinical team.
9. DOCUMENTATION AND RECORDS
• Maintain all records of calibration, quality control, specimen
testing, and result verification according to laboratory policy.
• Ensure that corrective actions for any out-of-range controls are
documented.
10. NOTES
Method Limitations:
• Any interference from hemolysis, lipemia, or icterus should be
noted and documentation of specimen rejection should be
performed accordingly.
• Specific method interferences should be consulted in the reagent
kit insert.
References:
• Manufacturer’s reagent insert for amylase assay.
• Laboratory’s quality control manual.
