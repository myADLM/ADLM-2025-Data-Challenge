Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Amylase, Plasma
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the procedures for the analytical phase of
generating results for amylase enzyme activity in plasma. The aim is
to ensure accuracy, reliability, and consistency in the results.
2. SCOPE
This procedure is applicable to all laboratory personnel involved in
the processing and analysis of plasma amylase samples.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Designated Laboratory Staff: Responsible for performing the
analysis, maintaining the equipment, and ensuring compliance
with this procedure.
• Supervisors/Managers: Responsible for reviewing results,
ensuring proper documentation, and addressing any issues that
may arise.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen Type:
• Plasma collected in lithium heparin, EDTA, or sodium fluoride/
potassium oxalate tube.
Specimen Stability:
• Plasma is stable for up to 7 days when stored at 2-8°C.
• For longer storage, plasma can be frozen at -20°C or lower for up
to 1 month.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed samples.
• Clotted samples.
• Samples with insufficient volume.
5. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
Equipment:
• Automated Chemistry Analyzer compatible with amylase assays.
• Centrifuge.
• Pipettes and disposable tips.
Reagents:
• Amylase reagent kits (specific to the chemistry analyzer in use).
• Quality control materials (low, normal, and high levels).
6. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Verify Specimen: Confirm specimen type and condition,
ensuring it meets requirements.
2. Centrifugation: If necessary, centrifuge the blood samples to
separate plasma. Ensure plasma is clear and free from
hemolysis.
Calibration:
1. Calibrate the Analyzer: Follow the manufacturer's instructions
to perform calibration of the chemistry analyzer using the
provided calibrators.
2. Run Quality Controls: Analyze quality control materials at
least once per shift to ensure the analyzer's performance is
within acceptable ranges. Record QC results and take
corrective actions if QC fails.
Running the Test:
1. Load Reagents: Load amylase reagent kits into the analyzer
as per the manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Program the Analyzer: Enter patient sample information into
the analyzer, including patient ID, test requested, and sample
identification.
3. Sample Analysis: Place plasma samples in the designated
sample rack or holder. Start the analysis according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
4. Monitor Analysis: Ensure the analyzer runs without
interruptions. Address any alerts or errors according to the
troubleshooting guide.
Reviewing and Reporting Results:
1. Result Verification: Review results generated by the analyzer.
Verify that all QC checks are within acceptable limits.
2. Instrument Flags: Investigate any flagged results or error
messages by repeating the assay or using an alternate method
if necessary.
3. Document Results: Enter results into the Laboratory
Information System (LIS). Ensure all patient details are
accurate and results are reported within the established
turnaround time.
4. Critical Values: Promptly notify the appropriate healthcare
provider if any critical values are detected, following the
institution’s critical value policy.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Internal QC: Perform QC checks using quality control materials
at each calibration, new reagent lot, and after any significant
maintenance.
2. External Proficiency Testing: Participate in external
proficiency testing programs as recommended.
3. Documentation: Maintain accurate records of all QC results,
calibrations, and maintenance activities.
8. TROUBLESHOOTING
1. Analyzer Errors: Refer to the manufacturer’s troubleshooting
guide for specific error codes and steps to resolve issues.
2. Inconsistent Results: Re-analyze samples if results are
inconsistent. Consider alternate methods if discrepancies
persist.
