1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this protocol is to ensure the accurate and timely
analysis of serum amylase levels following standardized procedures.
This protocol is designed to maintain consistency in performing and
documenting the analysis, to ensure reliable results, and to comply
with CLIA guidelines.
2. SCOPE
This protocol applies to all laboratory personnel involved in the
analysis of serum amylase.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of designated laboratory personnel to perform
and document the test as defined in this procedure. All staff are
accountable for the identification and reporting of any issues that may
affect the results of the test.
4. SPECIMEN
Preferred/acceptable:
• Serum specimens collected in SST (Serum Separator Tube) or
red-top tubes. Allow specimens to clot and then centrifuge to
separate serum.
Unacceptable:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric specimens.
• Specimens collected with any anticoagulant.
• Serum specimens that have been stored beyond the
recommended stability period without proper preservation.
5. REAGENTS, EQUIPMENT, AND SUPPLIES
Reagents:
• Amylase Reagent Set: Store according to manufacturer’s
instructions. Check expiration dates before use.
• Calibrators and controls: Store at 2-8°C. Use within the expiry
date.
• Deionized water.
Equipment and Supplies:
• Automated Chemistry Analyzer (e.g., Cobas, AU, Architect)
• Calibrated pipettes
• Centrifuge
• SST (Serum Separator Tubes)
• Standard lab ware (e.g., test tubes, racks)
• Quality control material
6. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation and QC
1. Ensure all reagents, calibrators, and controls are within the
expiration date and properly stored.
2. Bring reagents and controls to room temperature if instructed
by the manufacturer.
3. Perform regular maintenance and calibration of the chemistry
analyzer as per the manufacturer’s user manual.
4. Run quality control samples at the beginning of each testing
day and with every new lot of reagents. Ensure all QC results
fall within acceptable ranges before proceeding.
B. Sample Preparation
1. Ensure that patient serum samples are correctly labeled and
have been processed properly.
2. If samples have been refrigerated, allow them to reach room
temperature (15-25°C) before analysis.
3. Centrifuge specimens if needed to ensure serum clarity.
C. Testing
1. Load the automated chemistry analyzer with patient samples,
quality controls, and calibrators.
2. Select the AMYLASE, TOTAL, SERUM test profile on the
analyzer.
3. Follow the analyzer’s instruction manual to start the test run.
4. The analyzer will automatically handle sample aspiration,
reagent addition, incubation, and measurement.
D. Result Validation
1. Upon completion of the assay, review the results generated by
the analyzer.
2. Confirm that control values are within acceptable limits. If any
control fails, troubleshoot according to the manufacturer's
guidelines and repeat testing.
3. Evaluate patient results for any flags or indicators that might
suggest potential issues (e.g., hemolysis, lipemia).
E. Reporting Results
1. Transmit the validated results to the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
2. Review and verify the results in the LIS before final reporting.
3. Flag and handle critical values as per laboratory policy for
notification and documentation.
7. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Normal range: Consult manufacturer's product insert or local
laboratory established reference intervals.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the manufacturer’s instructions for limitations of the assay,
including potential interferences from hemolysis, lipemia, and icterus.
9. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run quality control (QC) tests daily and document results. The
QC should include at least two levels (normal and abnormal).
• Follow manufacturer’s guidelines for acceptable ranges.
Investigate and resolve any QC failures before proceeding with
patient testing.
• Perform proficiency testing as scheduled.
10. SAFETY PRECAUTIONS
• Standard Precautions: Treat all human specimens as potentially
infectious.
• Follow laboratory’s safety policies regarding PPE and proper
waste disposal.
