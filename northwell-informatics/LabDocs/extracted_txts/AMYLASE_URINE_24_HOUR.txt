Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase of Generating Results for Amylase, Urine, 24
Hour
1. PURPOSE
This SOP provides detailed instructions for the processing, analysis,
and reporting of 24-hour urine amylase tests in the laboratory. The
goal is to ensure accuracy, precision, and reliability in test results.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all technical staff performing the analysis of
24-hour urine samples for amylase in the clinical laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
All laboratory personnel performing the analysis are responsible for
following this SOP and ensuring accurate documentation throughout
the analytical process.
4. EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS
• Centrifuge
• Calibrated pipettes
• Disposable pipette tips
• Digital timer
• Amylase substrate reagent
• Control materials (both Normal and Abnormal levels)
• Urine collection container
• Calibrated automated chemistry analyzer (e.g., Beckman Coulter
AU5800)
• Quality control records
5. PROCEDURE
Specimen Requirements:
a. Specimen Collection:
• Collect 24-hour urine in a clean, polystyrene container without
preservatives.
• Ensure the container is labeled with the patient identification, start
and end dates/times of collection.
b. Specimen Storage and Stability:
• Store the specimen at 2-8°C during and after collection.
• If analysis is delayed, the specimen can be stored at 2-8°C for up
to 24 hours, or frozen at -20°C for up to 1 week.
Preparation:
1. Specimen Preparation:
◦ Measure the total volume of the 24-hour urine specimen and
record it on the accession form.
◦ Mix the urine very well to ensure homogeneity.
2. Aliquot Preparation:
◦ Aliquot a portion of the thoroughly mixed 24-hour urine
sample into a labeled test tube for analysis.
Analytical Phase:
1. Calibration:
◦ Perform calibration of the automated chemistry analyzer as
per manufacturer’s instructions using traceable calibration
materials. Document calibration details.
2. Quality Control:
• Run quality control materials (both Normal and Abnormal levels)
according to the laboratory's quality control program at the
beginning of each shift and after any maintenance or batch of
tests.
• Acceptable QC ranges must have been pre-established based on
laboratory criteria.
• If QC results are out of the acceptable range, take corrective
action, including recalibrating the analyzer and re-running QC.
1. Sample Analysis:
◦ Load the urine aliquot into the chemistry analyzer sample
rack.
◦ Verify that the analyzer is correctly set for urine amylase
analysis (check assay settings and reaction conditions).
◦ Start the analysis per the chemistry analyzer’s protocol.
2. Analysis Verification:
◦ Upon completion, review results for any flagged values or
outliers.
◦ Compare the patient results to the established reference
values.
6. REPORTING RESULTS:
• Record the volume of the 24-hour urine sample.
• Report the amylase concentration in the units specified by the
laboratory (e.g., U/L).
• Note any dilutions if the initial result is above the upper calibration
limit.
• Report the final result including the total 24-hour amylase activity
by multiplying the amylase concentration by the total volume of
urine collected (in liters).
7. REFERENCE INTERVALS:
• Normal Range: 24-400 U/hr
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
• Hemolysis, bacterial contamination, or improper storage may
affect results.
• Highly concentrated or dilute urine specimens can skew results;
ensure proper analytical dilution if required.
9. QUALITY ASSURANCE:
• Adhere to all relevant laboratory quality assurance protocols.
• Maintain documentation for any deviations, corrective actions,
and preventive measures adopted.

11. REVISION HISTORY:
• Document any changes to this SOP and the reason for the
revisions.
This protocol ensures consistency and accuracy in the processing
and reporting of 24-hour urine amylase results in compliance with
laboratory accreditation standards.
