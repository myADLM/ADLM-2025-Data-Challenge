Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analysis of AMYLASE,
URINE, RANDOM
1. PURPOSE
To ensure accurate and consistent analysis of AMYLASE, URINE,
RANDOM in order to aid in the diagnosis and management of clinical
conditions.
2. SPECIMEN
Preferred/acceptable:
• A random urine sample collected in a clean, dry container, without
preservatives.
Unacceptable:
• Samples collected in containers with preservatives.
• Samples that are visibly contaminated.
• Samples that have not been properly stored and transported
(should be refrigerated if not analyzed immediately).
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Spectrophotometer or automated analyzer capable of measuring
amylase activity.
• Amylase reagent kit (compatible with the specific analyzer used).
• Controls (normal and abnormal).
• Calibrators.
• Clean pipettes and pipette tips (if manual pipetting is required).
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) including lab coats, gloves,
and safety goggles.
4. PROCEDURE
Sample Preparation:
1. Upon receiving the urine sample, verify the patient information
and ensure the sample is properly labeled.
2. Mix the urine sample well by gentle inversion before aliquoting
for analysis.
Setup:
1. Power on the spectrophotometer or automated analyzer and
ensure it is properly calibrated.
2. Load the amylase reagent kit and controls according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
3. Ensure all reagents are within their expiration dates and have
been stored correctly.
Calibration:
1. Perform calibration of the analyzer using the calibrators
provided in the amylase reagent kit.
2. Follow the manufacturer's instructions to complete the
calibration process.
3. Document the calibration results in the calibration log.
Quality Control:
1. Run quality control samples (both normal and abnormal) before
analyzing patient samples.
2. Verify that control results are within the acceptable range
provided by the manufacturer.
3. Document and review QC results. If controls are not within the
acceptable range, do not proceed with patient sample analysis.
Investigate and resolve any issues before re-running controls.
Sample Analysis:
1. Pipette the required volume of urine sample into the reaction
cuvette or sample holder according to the reagent kit
instructions.
2. Add the appropriate amount of reagent to the sample as per the
manufacturer's instructions.
3. Mix the reaction mixture thoroughly and initiate the reaction by
starting the analyzer.
4. The analyzer will measure the increase in absorbance, which is
directly proportional to the amylase activity in the sample.
Result Verification:
1. Review the generated results from the analyzer.
2. Verify that all QC results are within acceptable limits to validate
the analysis session.
3. Any flagged or out-of-range results should be rechecked for
possible pre-analytical or analytical errors.
Reporting Results:
1. Record the amylase results in the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
2. Include a comment if any pre-analytical issues were identified,
or if the QC results were initially out of range but subsequently
passed after resolving issues.
3. Ensure critical results are communicated promptly to the
appropriate healthcare provider as per laboratory protocols.
5. REFERENCE INTERVAL
• Typically provided by the reagent manufacturer or determined by
the laboratory's validation studies.
◦ Normal Range: 10-490 U/L (Ranges may vary, refer to site-
specific guidelines)
6. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolysis, lipemia, or bilirubin may interfere with the analysis and
should be noted if present.
• Ensure proper sample handling to avoid degradation of amylase
activity.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Regularly perform preventive maintenance on analyzers as per
the manufacturer’s instructions.
• Participate in external proficiency testing programs to ensure
ongoing accuracy and reliability.
8. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions for the specific amylase reagent kit
used.
• Laboratory internal validation studies and QC logs.
This protocol ensures precise, reliable, and efficient analysis of
AMYLASE, URINE, RANDOM samples to provide accurate
diagnostic information for patient care.
