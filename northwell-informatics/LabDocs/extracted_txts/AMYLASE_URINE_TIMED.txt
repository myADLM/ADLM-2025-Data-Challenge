SOP: Analytical Phase for Generating Results for AMYLASE, URINE,
TIMED
1. PURPOSE
To establish a standardized procedure for the analysis and reporting
of urinary amylase levels in timed urine collections, ensuring
accuracy and reliability of test results.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing
the analysis, QC procedures, and reporting of results as per this
protocol.
• All personnel must report any deviations or issues encountered
during the test process to the supervisor immediately.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Automated biochemical analyzer (e.g., Roche Cobas, Beckman
AU series, etc.)
• Calibrators and controls specific to urinary amylase analysis
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Timed urine collection containers
• Personal protective equipment (PPE) as required by laboratory
safety protocols
1. SPECIMEN HANDLING
3.1. Specimen Requirements:
• Timed urine collection (e.g., 24-hour urine)
• Ensure the entire volume of urine is accurately measured and
recorded
3.2. Specimen Acceptance:
• Acceptable: Specimens collected over a specified time period,
properly labeled with date and time of collection start and end.
• Unacceptable: Specimens with incomplete collection, significant
contamination, or improperly labeled.
3.3. Specimen Preparation:
• Mix the entire urine collection thoroughly.
• Measure and record the total volume of the urine collected.
• Aliquot an appropriate volume (usually 5-10 mL) for analysis.
1. PROCEDURE
4.1. Calibration and Quality Control:
• Perform instrument calibration using the recommended calibrators
for urinary amylase.
• Run quality control (QC) materials at the beginning of each shift
or as per the manufacturer’s instructions.
• Document QC results and ensure they are within the acceptable
range before proceeding with specimen analysis.
4.2. Analytical Procedure:
1. Sample Preparation:
◦ Label the aliquot tube with the patient's identification and
test order number.
◦ Ensure that aliquots are at room temperature (if stored
refrigerated, allow to equilibrate for 30 minutes).
2. Loading Samples:
◦ Load patient samples, calibrators, and QC materials onto
the automated analyzer according to the instrument’s
requirements.
3. Running the Test:
◦ Input necessary patient and sample information into the
analyzer software.
◦ Initiate the analysis sequence as per the manufacturer's
instructions.
4. Monitoring the Test:
◦ Observe the analyzer for any alerts or error messages
during the run.
◦ Ensure the instrument processes all samples without
interruption.
4.3. Result Validation:
1. Review Results:
◦ Validate that results from internal QC are within the
acceptable limits.
◦ Check for any instrument flags or errors for each patient
sample.
2. Calculate Urinary Amylase Levels:
◦ Calculate the amylase concentration using the urine
amylase activity value (U/L) and the total volume of urine
collected (in liters).
◦ The final result should be expressed as U/L/24 hours or as
specified by the clinical requirement.
3. Document Results:
◦ Enter the results into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS) for review.
◦ Ensure all manual calculations are verified and documented
accurately.
4. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results are automatically transmitted to the LIS and must be
reviewed and verified by the technologist.
• Follow site-specific reporting guidelines for result entry,
interpretation, and communication.
• Document any critical values and ensure communication with the
requesting physician as per laboratory protocol.
1. QUALITY CONTROL AND MAINTENANCE
• Follow the manufacturer's recommended maintenance schedules
for the analyzer.
• Ensure that QC procedures are performed consistently and
documented accurately.
• Address any instrument malfunctions or deviations in QC results
promptly.
