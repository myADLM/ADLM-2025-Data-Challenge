Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase:
Generating Results for Amyloidosis, Transthyretin-Associated
Familial, Reflex, Blood
1. Purpose: The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedures
for the analysis and reporting of Amyloidosis, Transthyretin-
Associated Familial (ATTR), Reflex, Blood results in a CLIA-
certified laboratory.
2. Responsibility: Laboratory technologists are responsible for
performing the assay, quality control, data analysis, and
reporting of results. Supervisors are responsible for ensuring
compliance with this SOP and addressing any issues or
discrepancies.
3. Specimen Requirements:
◦ Specimen Type: Whole blood collected in EDTA (lavender
top) tubes.
◦ Specimen Volume: Minimum 5 mL of whole blood.
◦ Specimen Stability: Refrigerated (2-8°C) and must be
processed within 72 hours of collection.
◦ Unacceptable Specimens: Hemolyzed, clotted, or
improperly labeled specimens.
4. Reagents, Equipment, and Supplies:
◦ Reagents: Specific reagents for Transthyretin (TTR) protein
measurement and molecular genetic testing for TTR gene
mutations.
◦ Equipment:
▪ Automated DNA extraction instrument.
▪ PCR thermocycler.
▪ Capillary electrophoresis system or DNA sequencer.
▪ Spectrophotometer or mass spectrometer for protein
analysis.
◦ Supplies:
▪ EDTA collection tubes.
▪ PCR reagents and consumables.
▪ Pipettes and tips.
▪ Centrifuge.
▪ Sterile tubes for sample aliquoting.
5. Procedure: A. Sample Preparation:
1. Upon receipt, log the specimen into the Laboratory
Information System (LIS) and assign a unique identifier.
2. Inspect the specimen for acceptability (e.g., correct
labeling, volume, absence of hemolysis).
3. Centrifuge the whole blood sample at 2000-2500 RPM for
10 minutes to separate plasma.
B. DNA Extraction:
1. Extract DNA from peripheral blood leukocytes using the
automated DNA extraction instrument following the
manufacturer's protocol.
2. Measure the DNA concentration using a
spectrophotometer and ensure the purity (A260/A280
ratio between 1.8 and 2.0).
3. Store the extracted DNA at -20°C until further processing.
C. PCR Amplification:
1. Prepare the PCR mix using specific primers for the TTR
gene.
2. Transfer the mix into PCR tubes and add the extracted
DNA template.
3. Load the tubes into the thermocycler and run the
amplification program.
4. Confirm PCR product size using gel electrophoresis.
D. DNA Sequencing:
1. Purify the PCR products using a suitable purification
method (e.g., spin column).
2. Sequence the purified PCR products using a capillary
electrophoresis system or DNA sequencer.
3. Analyze the sequencing data to identify any mutations in
the TTR gene.
E. Protein Analysis (if required):
1. Use mass spectrometry or immunoassay techniques to
quantify TTR protein levels in the plasma.
2. Calibrate the instrument and run quality control samples
prior to analyzing patient samples.
F. Data Analysis and Interpretation:
1. Review the sequencing and protein analysis data.
2. Compare the obtained sequences against reference
databases to identify pathogenic mutations.
3. Consult a pathologist or geneticist if required for
interpretation of complex results.
6. Quality Control:
◦ Include positive and negative controls in every run.
◦ Follow the manufacturer's instructions for quality control
material handling and usage.
◦ Document all quality control results and perform corrective
actions if results fall outside acceptable ranges.
7. Reporting Results:
◦ Enter results into the LIS and review for accuracy.
◦ Validate the results in the LIS prior to release.
◦ Prepare a comprehensive report including mutation details,
interpretation, and recommendations.
◦ Ensure results are transmitted to the ordering physician in a
timely manner.
8. Documentation:
◦ Maintain a log of all specimens, controls, and reagents.
◦ Record all analytical runs, quality control, and any
deviations from the SOP.
◦ Archive reports and raw data for future reference and audit.
9. References:
◦ Manufacturer's protocol for DNA extraction, PCR, and
sequencing kits.
◦ Relevant clinical guidelines for the diagnosis and
management of transthyretin-associated amyloidosis.
◦ CAP and CLIA regulations for laboratory procedures and
quality control.
This SOP ensures the accurate and reliable generation of results for
Amyloidosis, Transthyretin-Associated Familial, Reflex, Blood tests,
maintaining compliance with regulatory standards.
