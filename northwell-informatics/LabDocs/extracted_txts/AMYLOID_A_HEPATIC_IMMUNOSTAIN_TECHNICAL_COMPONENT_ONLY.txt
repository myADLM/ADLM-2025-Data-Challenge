Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for AMYLOID A (HEPATIC)
IMMUNOSTAIN, TECHNICAL COMPONENT ONLY
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedure for
the technical component of Amyloid A (Hepatic) Immunostaining,
ensuring standardized and accurate staining of hepatic tissue to
allow for the detection of amyloid deposits.
2. SCOPE This procedure applies to all trained personnel performing
Amyloid A (Hepatic) Immunostaining within the lab.
3. RESPONSIBILITIES
• It is the responsibility of all trained laboratory personnel to perform
these procedures accurately.
• Supervisors must ensure that all personnel are properly trained
and that the laboratory maintains adequate supplies and
reagents.
• It is each technologist’s responsibility to document all activities
accurately.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE)
tissue sections.
• Specimen Size: Tissue sections should be 3-4 micrometers thick.
• Handling: Ensure that all samples are handled with care to avoid
damage. Samples must be properly labeled with patient
identifiers.
5. SUPPLIES AND EQUIPMENT
• XX brand Automated Staining System
• Amyloid A primary antibody (validated for FFPE tissue)
• Detection kit reagents, including secondary antibody, substrate-
chromogen, and counterstain
• Positive and negative control tissue slides
• Mounting medium and coverslips
• Microtome
• Water bath
• Microscope
6. REAGENT PREPARATION AND STORAGE
• Store all antibodies and reagents according to manufacturer
instructions (refrigerated at 2-8°C unless otherwise specified).
• Ensure reagents are within their expiry dates and prepared fresh
where required.
• Prepare working solutions of primary antibody and detection kits
as per manufacturer’s guidelines.
7. PROCEDURE
**7.1 Preparation of Tissue Sections
• Deparaffinization:
◦ Place tissue sections in a series of xylene baths to
deparaffinize:
▪ Xylene I: 5 min
▪ Xylene II: 5 min
◦ Hydrate sections through a series of graded alcohols:
▪ 100% ethanol: 2 changes, 3 min each
▪ 95% ethanol: 1 change, 3 min
▪ 70% ethanol: 1 change, 3 min
◦ Rinse slides thoroughly in distilled water.
**7.2 Antigen Retrieval
• Heat-induced epitope retrieval (HIER):
◦ Immerse slides in retrieval buffer (e.g., EDTA, pH 8.0, or
citrate buffer, pH 6.0).
◦ Heat the buffer to 95-100°C for 20 minutes using a water bath
or microwave.
◦ Allow slides to cool for 20 minutes at room temperature.
◦ Rinse in distilled water.
**7.3 Immunostaining Procedure
• Apply the primary Amyloid A antibody to the tissue sections.
• Incubate at 4°C overnight or follow manufacturer specifications for
optimal incubation conditions.
• Rinse slides in PBS or TBS buffer 3 times for 5 minutes each.
• Apply the secondary antibody from the detection kit.
• Incubate according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
• Rinse slides in PBS or TBS buffer 3 times for 5 minutes each.
• Apply the substrate-chromogen solution and monitor the
development of staining. Typically, this takes 5-10 minutes.
• Rinse slides in running tap water for 5 minutes.
7.4 Counterstaining
• Counterstain sections with hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes.
• Rinse in running tap water for 5 minutes, followed, optionally, by a
bluing step in ammonia water.
7.5 Dehydration and Mounting
• Dehydrate sections through graded alcohols (70%, 95%, and
100% ethanol, followed by xylene).
• Mount with a permanent mounting medium and cover with
coverslips.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
• Always include positive and negative control slides with each
batch of patient samples to ensure staining reliability.
• Evaluate control slides for expected staining quality:
◦ Positive control should demonstrate specific staining in known
amyloid-positive tissue.
◦ Negative control should show no staining in amyloid-negative
tissue.
9. DOCUMENTATION AND REPORTING
• Record all relevant information including antibody lot numbers,
reagent details, control results, and any deviations from the SOP.
• Document results in the laboratory information system (LIS).
• Ensure all observations are accurately entered and reviewed by a
qualified pathologist.
10. MAINTENANCE AND TROUBLESHOOTING
• Regularly maintain equipment as per manufacturer instructions.
• Troubleshoot common issues:
◦ Weak or no staining: Check antibody and reagent quality,
ensure effective antigen retrieval.
◦ Non-specific staining: Optimize antibody dilutions, ensure
thorough washing between steps.

• Manufacturer's instructions for primary antibody and detection kit.
• Laboratory SOP manuals for equipment operation.
This SOP will be reviewed and updated annually or as needed to
ensure compliance with new guidelines or technological
advancements.
