Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analysis of Amyloid Beta-
Protein
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the procedure for the analysis of Amyloid Beta-
Protein in clinical specimens, ensuring accurate and reliable results.
It includes steps for specimen preparation, assay performance, result
interpretation, quality control, and reporting.
Responsibility:
Designated staff are responsible for performing the analysis
according to the procedures detailed in this SOP. It is the
responsibility of all staff to identify any issues in the analytical
process that may affect the results and notify a supervisor.
1. SPECIMEN
Preferred/acceptable specimens: - Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
collected in a sterile, leak-proof container - Blood samples collected
in EDTA tubes, processed to obtain plasma
Unacceptable specimens: - Specimens that are hemolyzed, lipemic,
or icteric - Specimens collected in non-standard containers or with
other anticoagulants (e.g., heparin) - Specimens without proper
labeling including patient identification and collection date/time
Specimen Stability: - CSF specimens: stable for up to 24 hours at
2-8°C - Plasma specimens: stable for up to 48 hours at 2-8°C
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment: - Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) reader -
Microplate washer - Refrigerated centrifuge - Pipettes and tips -
Vortex mixer
Reagents: - Amyloid Beta-Protein ELISA kits (follow manufacturer's
storage recommendations) - Standard diluent - Wash buffer -
Substrate solution - Stop solution
Supplies: - Disposable gloves and lab coat - Microplates - Tubes for
aliquot preparation - Plate seals
1. PROCEDURE
Specimen Preparation: 1. Centrifuge blood samples at 2,000-3,000
RPM for 10-15 minutes to separate plasma. 2. Aliquot CSF or plasma
into labeled tubes, avoiding any cellular material. 3. Store specimens
at 2-8°C until analysis and ensure specimens are at room
temperature before initiating the assay.
Assay Performance: 1. Follow the instructions provided in the
Amyloid Beta-Protein ELISA kit insert. 2. Prepare standards, controls,
and samples according to the kit’s instructions. 3. Pipette prepared
standards, controls, and sample aliquots into designated wells on the
microplate. 4. Incubate the microplate according to the kit’s
instructions, ensuring proper timing and temperature control. 5. Wash
the microplate using a microplate washer per the kit’s instructions. 6.
Add substrate solution and incubate again as directed. 7. Add stop
solution to terminate the reaction and prepare the microplate for
reading.
Result Interpretation: 1. Read the microplate using the ELISA reader
at the specified wavelength provided in the kit’s instructions. 2.
Generate a standard curve using the provided standards to
determine the concentrations of Amyloid Beta-Protein in patient
specimens. 3. Ensure the concentrations of the controls fall within the
acceptability range defined by the kit manufacturer.
Quality Control: - Run quality control samples with each batch of
patient specimens. - Acceptable ranges for control samples should
be maintained as specified by the kit manufacturer. - Document any
deviations and notify the supervisor immediately.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
Results should be transcribed or uploaded to the Laboratory
Information System (LIS) for review and verification by the
technologist. Report values quantitatively with reference intervals and
flag any critical values according to the laboratory’s protocol for
prompt notification to the healthcare provider.

specific reagent and procedural details for Amyloid Beta-Protein
ELISA kits.
Note: This SOP should be reviewed periodically (at least annually) to
ensure its accuracy and relevance, and updated as necessary to
accommodate advances in technology or modifications to laboratory
procedures.
