AMYLOID PRECURSOR PROTEIN (APP) IMMUNOSTAIN,
TECHNICAL COMPONENT ONLY SOP
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedure for performing
immunostaining of Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) on formalin-
fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue sections. The technical
component of the immunostaining procedure will ensure the
consistent and accurate identification of APP in tissue specimens.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing and
documenting the immunostaining procedure.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring the implementation and
adherence to the protocol.
1. DEFINITION
Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) Immunostain: A histochemical
procedure used to visualize the presence and distribution of APP in
tissue specimens. APP is processed and immunostained using
specific antibodies and visualization reagents.
1. PROCEDURE
3.1. Reagents and Supplies:
• Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue sections
• Xylene
• Ethanol (100%, 95%, 70%)
• Distilled water
• Tris-Buffered Saline (TBS)
• Peroxidase block solution
• Protein block solution
• Primary antibody specific for APP
• Secondary antibody conjugated to enzyme (e.g., HRP)
• Chromogen substrate (e.g., DAB)
• Hematoxylin
• Mounting medium
• Coverslips
• Positive control tissue
• Negative control reagent (e.g., non-immune serum)
3.2. Equipment:
• Microtome
• Hot plate
• Slide racks
• Humidity chamber
• Incubator (37°C)
• Light microscope
3.3. Specimen Handling and Preparation:
1. Cut 4-5 µm thick sections from FFPE tissue blocks using a
microtome.
2. Place tissue sections onto positively charged glass slides.
3. Allow slides to dry on a hot plate at 60°C for 30 minutes or in an
oven overnight.
3.4. Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
1. Immerse slides in xylene for 3 minutes, repeat twice.
2. Hydrate slides through a series of graded ethanol (3 minutes
each in 100%, 95%, and 70%).
3. Rinse slides in distilled water for 3 minutes.
3.5. Antigen Retrieval:
1. Perform antigen retrieval using heat-induced epitope retrieval
(HIER) method in citrate buffer (pH 6.0) or EDTA buffer (pH
9.0).
2. Heat slides in a pressure cooker or microwave for 15-20
minutes.
3. Allow slides to cool to room temperature for 20 minutes.
4. Rinse slides in TBS for 5 minutes.
3.6. Immunostaining:
1. Block endogenous peroxidase activity by incubating slides in
peroxidase block solution for 10 minutes.
2. Rinse slides in TBS for 3 minutes.
3. Block non-specific binding by incubating slides with protein
block solution for 10 minutes.
4. Incubate slides with primary antibody specific to APP for 1 hour
at room temperature or overnight at 4°C in a humidity chamber.
5. Rinse slides in TBS for 5 minutes, repeat twice.
6. Incubate slides with secondary antibody conjugated to enzyme
(e.g., HRP) for 30 minutes.
7. Rinse slides in TBS for 5 minutes, repeat twice.
8. Apply chromogen substrate (e.g., DAB) to slides for 5-10
minutes or until desired staining intensity is achieved.
9. Rinse slides in distilled water for 5 minutes.
3.7. Counterstaining and Mounting:
1. Counterstain slides with hematoxylin for 30 seconds to 1
minute.
2. Rinse slides in running tap water until clear.
3. Dehydrate slides through graded ethanol (70%, 95%, 100%).
4. Clear slides in xylene for 5 minutes, repeat twice.
5. Mount slides with mounting medium and coverslips.
3.8. Quality Control:
1. Include a positive control slide with each staining run to ensure
the staining procedure is working correctly.
2. Include a negative control slide using non-immune serum to
ensure specificity of the primary antibody.
3. Document staining results and any deviations or issues
encountered during the procedure.
4. Review stained slides under a light microscope to ensure
appropriate staining intensity and localization of APP.
5. REPORTING RESULTS
Results are to be documented in the laboratory information system
(LIS) according to site-specific guidelines. The slides are reviewed by
a pathologist for interpretation and diagnostic reporting.
