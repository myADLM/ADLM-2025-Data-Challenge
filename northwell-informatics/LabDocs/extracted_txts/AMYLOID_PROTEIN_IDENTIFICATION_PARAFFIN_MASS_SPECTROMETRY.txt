Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Amyloid Protein
Identification, Paraffin, Mass Spectrometry
1. Purpose
◦ To outline the procedure for identifying amyloid proteins
from paraffin-embedded tissue samples using mass
spectrometry (MS).
2. Scope
◦ This procedure is applicable to the analysis of paraffin-
embedded tissue samples for the identification of amyloid
proteins in a CLIA-certified laboratory.
3. Responsibilities
◦ Laboratory Scientists are responsible for performing the
steps outlined in this procedure and ensuring the accuracy
and reliability of the results.
◦ The Laboratory Supervisor is responsible for overseeing the
process and addressing any issues related to equipment or
sample quality.
4. Definitions
◦ Amyloid Proteins: Misfolded proteins that aggregate into
insoluble fibrils and are associated with various diseases.
◦ Paraffin-embedded Tissue: Tissue that has been fixed,
dehydrated, and embedded in paraffin wax for histological
examination.
◦ Mass Spectrometry (MS): An analytical technique used to
measure the mass-to-charge ratio of ions, useful for
identifying and quantifying molecules.
5. Specimen Requirements
◦ Only paraffin-embedded tissue samples prepared following
standard histopathological protocols are to be used.
◦ Ensure that tissue samples are properly labeled with patient
identification, collection date, and relevant clinical
information.
◦ Unacceptable specimens include mislabeled or
inadequately fixed tissue samples.
6. Equipment and Reagents
◦ Microtome
◦ Paraffin removal reagents (e.g., xylene)
◦ Rehydration solutions (graded ethanol series)
◦ Trypsin or other proteolytic enzymes
◦ Mass Spectrometer (e.g., MALDI-TOF, LC-MS/MS)
◦ Centrifuge
◦ Pipettes and tips
◦ 1.5 mL Microcentrifuge tubes
7. Procedure A. Tissue Sectioning and Deparaffinization:
1. Section 5-10 μm thick slices of paraffin-embedded tissue
using a microtome.
2. Place the sections into 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes.
3. Add 1 mL of xylene to each tube and incubate at room
temperature for 10 minutes to remove paraffin.
4. Centrifuge the tubes at 10,000 x g for 5 minutes and
discard the supernatant.
5. Repeat xylene treatment twice.
6. Rehydrate the tissue by successive washes in decreasing
concentrations of ethanol (100%, 95%, 70%) for 5
minutes each.
B. Protein Extraction and Digestion:
1. Add rehydration solution (e.g., Tris buffer) to the tube to cover
the tissue.
2. Sonicate the tubes in a water bath for 10 minutes to facilitate
protein extraction.
3. Centrifuge at 10,000 x g for 5 minutes and transfer the
supernatant to a new tube.
4. To the supernatant, add an appropriate volume of proteolytic
enzyme (trypsin) and incubate at 37°C for 16-18 hours.
C. Peptide Cleanup and Concentration:
1. Use peptide desalting columns or C18 tips to clean up the
peptide digest.
2. Concentrate the peptides by drying under vacuum (speed vac).
D. Mass Spectrometry Analysis:
1. Reconstitute the dried peptides in an MS-compatible solvent
(e.g., 0.1% formic acid in water).
2. Load the sample onto the mass spectrometer injection system.
3. Conduct MS analysis as per the manufacturer’s instructions
and laboratory protocols.
4. Perform data acquisition in appropriate MS mode (e.g., Data
Dependent Acquisition for LC-MS/MS).
E. Data Analysis:
1. Use appropriate software tools for peptide identification against
a relevant protein database.
2. Confirm identification of amyloid proteins by analyzing the
peptide sequences and applying post-processing validation
criteria.
3. Quality Control
◦ Include standard proteins and previously characterized
amyloid tissue sections as controls in each batch of samples
processed.
◦ Perform routine maintenance and calibration of the mass
spectrometer according to the manufacturer’s guidelines.
◦ Ensure consistency in sample processing by regularly
validating methods and reagents.
4. Reporting Results
◦ Review and verify identified proteins and prepare a
comprehensive report summarizing the findings.
◦ Results should be documented in the laboratory information
system (LIS) and reviewed by a qualified pathologist before
releasing to the clinician.
5. References
◦ Standard histopathology texts and protocols.
◦ Manufacturer’s instructions for mass spectrometry
instruments.
◦ International amyloid and protein databases.
