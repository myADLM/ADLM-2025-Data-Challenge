Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Amyloid P (SAP)
Immunostain, Technical Component Only
1. Purpose
The purpose of this Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is to
outline the method for the technical component of generating results
for amyloid P (SAP) immunostaining in the laboratory. This procedure
is designed to ensure consistent, accurate and reliable processing
and staining of tissue samples for the presence of amyloid P protein.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of laboratory personnel trained in
immunohistochemistry (IHC) techniques to follow this SOP. The
supervisor must ensure that all personnel are familiar with and
adhere to this procedure.
1. Specimen Requirements
Specimen Type: - Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue blocks -
Tissue sections mounted on positively charged slides
Specimen Preparation: - Sections should be cut at 4-5 microns
thick - Slides should be dried at 60°C for 1 hour before staining
1. Reagents, Equipment and Supplies
Reagents: - Primary Antibody: Anti-Amyloid P (SAP) antibody
suitable for IHC - Secondary Antibody: Biotinylated secondary
antibody - Detection System: Avidin-Biotin Complex (ABC) kit and
DAB (3,3'-diaminobenzidine) substrate. - Counterstain: Hematoxylin -
Negative Controls: Slides treated with isotype control immunoglobulin
- Positive Controls: Known positive tissue for amyloid P protein
Equipment: - Microscope - Humidity chamber - Automated IHC
Stainer (if available) - Microtome - Water Bath - Cover Slipper
Supplies: - Coplin jars or slide staining racks - Pipettes and tips -
Disposable gloves, lab coat, and other personal protective equipment
(PPE) - Slide labels
1. Procedure
Deparaffinization and Rehydration: 1. Place slides in a slide holder
and deparaffinize by immersing in xylene for 2 minutes, repeat twice.
2. Rehydrate slides through a series of graded ethanol solutions
(100%, 95%, 70%, and distilled water) for 2 minutes each.
Antigen Retrieval: 1. Heat-induced antigen retrieval is performed by
using specific buffers (e.g., Citrate Buffer pH 6.0) and heating in a
microwave or pressure cooker for 10-20 minutes. 2. Allow sections to
cool in the retrieval solution for 20 minutes at room temperature.
Blocking: 1. Place slides in a humidity chamber. 2. Apply blocking
solution (e.g., normal serum or BSA) to each section for 10 minutes
to prevent non-specific binding.
Primary Antibody Incubation: 1. Drain blocking solution and apply
the primary anti-amyloid P (SAP) antibody to the slides. 2. Incubate
overnight at 4°C or for 1 hour at room temperature in the humidity
chamber.
Secondary Antibody Incubation: 1. Wash slides gently with PBS
buffer 3 times for 5 minutes each. 2. Apply the biotinylated secondary
antibody to the slides. 3. Incubate at room temperature for 30
minutes.
Detection: 1. Wash slides with PBS buffer 3 times for 5 minutes
each. 2. Apply the ABC reagent to the slides following the
manufacturer’s instructions. 3. Incubate at room temperature for 30
minutes. 4. Wash slides with PBS buffer 3 times for 5 minutes each.
5. Apply DAB substrate and monitor the color development under a
microscope.
Counterstaining: 1. Rinse slides with distilled water. 2. Counterstain
with hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes. 3. Rinse slides in running tap water
for 5 minutes. 4. Dehydrate slides through graded ethanol solutions
(70%, 95%, and 100%) for 2 minutes each. 5. Clear in xylene for 2
minutes, repeat twice.
Mounting: 1. Apply mounting medium and cover slip. 2. Allow slides
to dry.
1. Quality Control
◦ Include positive and negative controls with each batch of
samples processed.
◦ Ensure reagents are within their expiration dates and stored
according to manufacturer's recommendations.
◦ Document the results of control tissues and take corrective
actions if controls do not perform as expected.
2. Reporting Results
◦ The technical staining component is now complete.
◦ Hand over stained slides to a qualified pathologist for
interpretation.
◦ Record the presence or absence of amyloid P (SAP) protein
in a standardized report form.
3. Troubleshooting
◦ If non-specific staining occurs, review blocking procedures
and antibody titration.
◦ Weak staining may require optimization of antigen retrieval
or antibody concentration.
◦ Ensure all equipment is functioning properly and reagents
are fresh.

Note: This procedure must be reviewed annually and updated as
necessary. It is critical that all steps are followed meticulously to
ensure the accurate and reproducible identification of amyloid P
(SAP) deposits in tissue sections.
