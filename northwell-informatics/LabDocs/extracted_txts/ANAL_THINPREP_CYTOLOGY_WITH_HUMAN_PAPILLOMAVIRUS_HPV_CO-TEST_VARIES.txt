Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for ANAL THINPREP CYTOLOGY WITH
HUMAN PAPILLOMAVIRUS (HPV) CO-TEST
1. PURPOSE
To provide standardized procedures for accurate and consistent
cytological analysis and HPV testing on Anal ThinPrep specimens.
This includes screening for cellular abnormalities and determining the
presence of high-risk HPV types.
Responsibility:
• Designated cytotechnologists and pathologists are responsible for
performing, documenting, and reporting cytological analysis and
HPV test results as per this SOP.
• Designated laboratory technicians are responsible for the timely
and accurate preparation of specimens for testing.
• All laboratory personnel must ensure the procedures are followed
meticulously and must report any discrepancies or issues to their
supervisor immediately.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Anal ThinPrep specimens collected using
appropriate collection devices.
• Specimen Volume: At least 10 mL of the collected specimen in the
PreservCyt solution.
• Specimen Stability: Store specimens at room temperature.
Specimens need to be processed within 21 days of collection.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• ThinPrep 5000 Processor or equivalent
• PreservCyt solution (Hologic Inc.)
• ThinPrep Imaging System (if applicable)
• BD SurePath collection vial and reagents
• CytoSpin 4 cytocentrifuge (for additional concentration if
necessary)
• HPV testing reagents and equipment (e.g., Cobas® HPV Test,
Hologic® Aptima® HPV assay)
• Microscope (manual reading, if not using imaging system)
• PPE (gloves, lab coat, face mask)
• Slides and coverslips
• Appropriate fixatives
1. PROCEDURE
A) ThinPrep Processing:
1. Specimen Reception and Verification:
◦ Verify specimen identity and information.
◦ Log specimen into the Laboratory Information Management
System (LIMS).
2. Specimen Preparation:
◦ Gently mix the PreservCyt vial by vortexing to ensure even
distribution.
◦ Place the vial onto the ThinPrep Processor and follow the
instrument instructions for slide preparation.
3. Staining:
◦ Stain the prepared slides with Papanicolaou stain or other
appropriate cytological stains.
◦ Ensure quality control by including known positive and
negative slides in the staining batch.
B) Cytological Screening:
1. Manual Screening (if imaging system not used):
◦ Screen the stained slides under the microscope for cellular
abnormalities.
◦ Document findings and classify the sample according to the
Bethesda System for reporting anal cytology.
Imaging System Screening:
◦ Load stained slides into the ThinPrep Imaging System.
◦ Review images flagged by the imaging system, screen for
cellular abnormalities, and record findings.
2. Quality Control and Review:
◦ At least 10% of negative and all positive cases should be
reviewed by a senior cytotechnologist or pathologist.
◦ Record and address any discrepancies found during the
review process.
C) High-Risk HPV Testing:
1. Specimen Preparation:
◦ Aliquot a portion of the thoroughly mixed specimen into the
HPV testing equipment as per manufacturer’s instructions.
2. HPV DNA/RNA Amplification:
◦ Load the aliquoted specimens into the HPV testing
instrument and run the test as per the instrument’s
operational manual.
◦ Ensure controls (positive and negative) are run with patient
samples as part of each run for quality assurance.
3. Results Analysis:
◦ Once testing is complete, review the data for validity.
◦ Document positive and negative results in the LIMS.
4. QUALITY ASSURANCE AND CONTROL
• Perform instrument calibrations and maintenance as required by
the manufacturer’s guidelines.
• Participate in external proficiency testing programs.
• Maintain detailed records of all quality control measures, including
instrument logs and control results.
• Review 10% of negative slides and all positives as a second
review by a pathologist or senior cytotechnologist.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Integrate the cytology and HPV test results in the LIMS.
• Cytotechnologists/pathologists should validate the final report
before it is released.
• Critical and unexpected findings must be immediately
communicated to the ordering physician.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS AND LIMITATIONS
• Cytology:
◦ Negative for intraepithelial lesion or malignancy.
◦ Atypical squamous cells (ASC-US or ASC-H).
◦ Low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) or High-
grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL).
• HPV Detection:
◦ HPV negative.
◦ HPV positive, specifying type if applicable (e.g., HPV 16, HPV
18, other high-risk types).
• Limitations: Inadequate specimen collection may result in false
negatives. Interferences such as contaminating substances may
affect the accuracy of both cytological analysis and HPV testing.
