SOP Title: Analytical Protocol for Anaplasma phagocytophilum
(Human Granulocytic Ehrlichiosis) Antibody, Serum
1. PURPOSE
To provide a detailed and standardized procedure for the detection of
Anaplasma phagocytophilum antibodies in serum samples using pre-
approved laboratory methods. This protocol ensures accurate,
reliable, and reproducible results for the diagnosis of Human
Granulocytic Ehrlichiosis (HGE).
2. SCOPE
This protocol applies to all clinical laboratory personnel responsible
for the analysis of serum samples for Anaplasma phagocytophilum
antibodies. It covers the complete process from preparation of
reagents and equipment to the generation and reporting of results.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of certified laboratory personnel to follow this
SOP accurately and to ensure the proper handling of specimens,
reagents, and equipment. It is also the responsibility of the laboratory
supervisor to ensure that all staff are trained and competent in
performing this assay.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
- Specimen type: Serum
- Collection container: Red-top or serum separator tube (SST)
- Volume: Minimum 1 mL of serum
- Handling: Centrifuge and separate serum within 2 hours of collection. Store at 2-8°C if testing within 72 hours. For longer storage, freeze at -20°C or below.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
- ELISA microplate reader capable of measuring absorbance at 450 nm
- Timer
- Pipettes and pipette tips (precision 0.1-1000 µL)
- Plate washer or multichannel pipette
- Vortex mixer
- Anaplasma phagocytophilum antibody ELISA kit, including:
* Microtiter plate with coated wells
* Dilution buffer
* Washing buffer
* TMB substrate solution
* Stop solution (usually 1 M H2SO4 or equivalent)
* Positive control serum
* Negative control serum
6. PROCEDURE
6.1 Preparation and Quality Control
- Ensure all reagents and samples are brought to room temperature (20-25°C) before use.
- Prepare wash buffer and dilution buffer according to the manufacturer's instructions.
- Perform quality control using positive and negative control sera supplied in the kit. Run controls in duplicate and confirm they fall within acceptable ranges before proceeding with patient samples.
6.2 ELISA Assay Procedure
- Label the microtiter plate wells for standards, controls, and patient samples.
- Add 100 µL of diluted patient serum (1:100 dilution in dilution buffer) to each designated well.
- Add 100 µL of each control serum to the designated wells.
- Incubate the plate at room temperature for 30 minutes.
- Wash the plate 5 times with 300 µL of wash buffer per well, removing any residual liquid by tapping the plate gently on absorbent paper.
- Add 100 µL of the conjugate (enzyme-labeled anti-human IgG) to each well.
- Incubate the plate at room temperature for 30 minutes.
- Wash the plate 5 times with 300 µL of wash buffer per well.
- Add 100 µL of TMB substrate solution to each well.
- Incubate the plate at room temperature for 10 minutes, avoiding direct sunlight.
- Add 100 µL of stop solution to each well to terminate the reaction.
- Measure and record the absorbance at 450 nm using a microplate reader within 15 minutes of adding the stop solution.
7. CALCULATION AND INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
- Calculate the mean absorbance of duplicate wells for each control and patient sample.
- Subtract the mean absorbance of the negative control from all samples and controls to obtain the corrected absorbance values.
- Compare the corrected absorbance of each patient sample to the cutoff value, which is determined based on the manufacturer's protocol or laboratory validation data.
Results Interpretation: - Positive: Sample absorbance value > cutoff
value, indicating the presence of antibodies against Anaplasma
phagocytophilum. - Negative: Sample absorbance value ≤ cutoff
value, indicating the absence of antibodies against Anaplasma
phagocytophilum. - Equivocal: Sample absorbance value falls within
the borderline range specified by the manufacturer. Recommend
retesting or further confirmatory testing if necessary.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
- Run positive and negative controls with each assay batch to ensure accuracy.
- Record and monitor control results to ensure they fall within acceptable ranges.
- Document and investigate any deviations or non-conformities.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
- Review and verify all results prior to reporting.
- Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS) with appropriate interpretation remarks.
