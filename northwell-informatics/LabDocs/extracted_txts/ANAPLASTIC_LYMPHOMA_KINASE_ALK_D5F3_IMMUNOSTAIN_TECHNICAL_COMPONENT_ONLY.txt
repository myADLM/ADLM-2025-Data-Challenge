Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase
(ALK[D5F3]) Immunostain, Technical Component Only
1. PURPOSE
This SOP provides detailed instructions for processing, staining, and
analyzing tissue specimens for the presence of Anaplastic
Lymphoma Kinase (ALK) using the ALK (D5F3) antibody via
immunohistochemistry (IHC). The goal is to ensure consistency,
accuracy, and reliability in detecting ALK protein expression in tissue
samples.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
This procedure is to be followed by all laboratory personnel trained in
IHC techniques and the use of the automated immunostainer.
Supervisors are responsible for ensuring compliance with this SOP
and for addressing any technical issues that may arise.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
◦ Specimen Type: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE)
tissue blocks.
◦ Specimen Preparation: Sections should be cut at 4-5
microns and mounted on positively charged slides. Ensure
slides are labeled properly with patient identifiers and
accession numbers.
◦ Unacceptable Specimens: Poorly fixed tissues, improperly
labeled specimens, or slides with sectioning artifacts.
2. REAGENTS AND EQUIPMENT
◦ Reagents:
▪ ALK (D5F3) primary antibody, pre-diluted.
▪ Detection kit (e.g., HRP-polymer detection system).
▪ DAB chromogen solution.
▪ Hematoxylin counterstain.
◦ Equipment:
▪ Automated IHC stainer (e.g., Ventana BenchMark, Leica
Bond-III).
▪ Microtome and water bath for sectioning.
▪ Incubation oven.
▪ Xylene and graded alcohols for deparaffinization and
rehydration.
▪ Coverslipper.
3. PROCEDURE
A. Slide Preparation:
• Cut sections at 4-5 microns using a microtome.
• Float sections on a 40-45°C water bath and mount on positively
charged slides.
• Dry slides in a 60°C oven for 1 hour or overnight at 37°C.
B. Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
• Deparaffinize slides in xylene for 3 x 5 minutes.
• Rehydrate through descending grades of alcohol: 100% ethanol
(2 x 5 minutes), 95% ethanol (2 x 5 minutes), and 70% ethanol (2
x 5 minutes).
• Wash slides in distilled water for 5 minutes.
C. Heat-Induced Epitope Retrieval:
• Place slides in a preheated retrieval buffer (e.g., citrate buffer pH
6.0) and incubate in a microwave or pressure cooker for
recommended time and temperature as per antibody
manufacturer’s instructions.
• Allow slides to cool in the buffer for 20 minutes at room
temperature.
• Rinse slides in distilled water.
D. Staining on Automated IHC Stainer:
• Load slides into the automated IHC stainer.
• Select the ALK (D5F3) protocol on the instrument.
• The automated process includes:
◦ Application of the primary antibody (ALK[D5F3]) for the
recommended incubation time.
◦ Application of the detection system (HRP-polymer).
◦ Development with DAB chromogen.
◦ Counterstaining with hematoxylin.
• After the run, remove slides from the stainer and proceed with the
following steps.
E. Dehydration and Clearing:
• Dehydrate slides through ascending grades of alcohol: 70%
ethanol (2 x 5 minutes), 95% ethanol (2 x 5 minutes), and 100%
ethanol (2 x 5 minutes).
• Clear in xylene (2 x 5 minutes).
F. Coverslipping:
• Mount slides with a compatible mounting medium and coverslip.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Include positive and negative control slides with each run to
validate staining procedure.
◦ Review of control slides should be performed to ensure
proper staining before interpretation of patient results.
◦ Document all controls and any deviations observed.
2. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
◦ The pathologist will review stained slides for ALK protein
expression.
◦ Positive staining is identified by brown chromogen
deposition in the cytoplasm and/or membrane of tumor cells.
◦ Negative results show no significant staining in the tumor
cells (background staining in non-tumor cells may be
observed).
◦ Report results as positive or negative for ALK expression.
3. DOCUMENTATION AND REPORTING
◦ All observations, including control results and any issues
encountered, should be documented in the laboratory's LIS
(Laboratory Information System).
◦ Submit completed and reviewed slides to the pathologist for
final diagnostic reporting.
4. TROUBLESHOOTING
◦ Refer to the instrument manual and reagent package inserts
for troubleshooting guidance.
◦ If technical issues persist, contact technical support for the
respective equipment or reagents.
◦ Record all troubleshooting steps taken in the QC log.
