Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Anaplastic Lymphoma
Kinase (ALK [OTI1A4]) Immunostain, Technical Component Only
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for conducting ALK (OTI1A4) immunostain
analysis, focusing exclusively on the technical component, ensuring
reliable and accurate results for diagnostic purposes.
Responsibility: It is the responsibility of the trained laboratory
personnel to perform the technical components of the immunostain
procedure per this SOP. Laboratory supervisors are responsible for
monitoring adherence to SOP and addressing any procedural
discrepancies.
1. DEFINITION
ALK (OTI1A4) immunostaining involves the application of a specific
antibody to detect the presence of ALK protein in tissue specimens.
This staining is instrumental in identifying certain types of lymphoma.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Preparation
1. Ensure all specimens are properly accessioned and labelled
with unique identifiers.
2. Confirm that specimens are adequately fixed in formalin and
embedded in paraffin.
3. Cut tissue sections at 4 micrometers thickness and mount on
positively charged slides.
4. Dry slides overnight at 37°C or for 1 hour at 60°C prior to
starting the staining process.
B. Deparaffinization and Rehydration
1. Deparaffinize tissue sections by immersing slides in xylene
twice for 5 minutes each.
2. Rehydrate sections through a series of graded alcohols: i.
100% ethanol for 2 minutes twice ii. 95% ethanol for 1 minute
iii. 80% ethanol for 1 minute iv. 70% ethanol for 1 minute
3. Rinse slides in distilled water for 5 minutes.
C. Antigen Retrieval
1. Place the slides in a slide holder and immerse in preheated
citrate buffer (10 mM, pH 6.0).
2. Perform heat-induced epitope retrieval using a pressure cooker
for 20 minutes.
3. Allow slides to cool in the buffer at room temperature for 20
minutes.
4. Rinse slides in distilled water for 5 minutes, followed by a wash
in PBS (phosphate-buffered saline) for 5 minutes.
D. Blocking
1. Incubate slides in 3% hydrogen peroxide for 10 minutes to
quench endogenous peroxidase activity.
2. Wash slides in PBS for 5 minutes.
3. Apply protein block to the slides, incubate for 10 minutes at
room temperature.
E. Primary Antibody Incubation
1. Prepare the ALK (OTI1A4) primary antibody according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Apply primary antibody to the tissue sections and incubate for 1
hour at room temperature.
3. Rinse slides in PBS for 5 minutes thrice.
F. Detection
1. Apply a biotinylated secondary antibody for 30 minutes at room
temperature.
2. Rinse slides in PBS for 5 minutes thrice.
3. Add streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (HRP) for 30 minutes
at room temperature.
4. Rinse slides in PBS for 5 minutes thrice.
G. Chromogen Development
1. Prepare the DAB (diaminobenzidine) substrate solution.
2. Apply DAB to slides and monitor the development of brown
color under a microscope for up to 5 minutes.
3. Stop the reaction by rinsing slides in distilled water.
H. Counterstaining
1. Counterstain tissue sections with hematoxylin for 1 minute.
2. Rinse slides in tap water until water runs clear.
3. Immerse slides in bluing reagent for 30 seconds.
4. Rinse slides thoroughly in tap water.
I. Dehydration
1. Dehydrate tissue sections through a series of graded alcohols:
i. 70% ethanol for 1 minute ii. 80% ethanol for 1 minute iii. 95%
ethanol for 1 minute iv. 100% ethanol for 2 minutes twice
2. Clear slides in xylene twice for 5 minutes each.
J. Mounting
1. Apply a suitable mounting medium and coverslip.
K. Quality Control
1. Include positive and negative control slides with each batch of
immunostaining.
2. Ensure controls show expected staining patterns.
3. REPORTING RESULTS
The technical component involves providing stained slides to the
Pathologist for interpretation. The pathologist will determine the
presence or absence of ALK expression.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Results interpretation is performed by the pathologist, based on
staining patterns observed.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
2. Prior to use, always verify reagent expiration dates.
3. Variability in fixation and processing times may affect staining
quality.
4. Ensure consistent antigen retrieval times and conditions.
