Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK) for Lung Cancer using
Immunohistochemistry (IHC)
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this protocol is to outline the steps
for the analytical phase of testing for Anaplastic Lymphoma
Kinase (ALK) in lung cancer specimens using
Immunohistochemistry (IHC) in a CLIA-certified laboratory.
Responsibility:
• It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory personnel to
ensure the accurate and timely completion of the procedure.
• It is the responsibility of the laboratory manager/supervisor to
verify that all steps are performed according to this SOP and that
any deviations are documented and addressed.
1. SPECIMEN Specimens for ALK IHC testing should be formalin-
fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue samples from patients
with suspected or confirmed lung cancer.
Specimen Handling:
• Ensure all samples are labeled correctly with appropriate patient
identifiers.
• Confirm that the sample is properly fixed and embedded. Tissue
blocks and slides should be stored at room temperature until
ready for analysis.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Microtome
• Water bath
• ALK-specific primary antibody
• Secondary antibody conjugated with HRP/DAB (horseradish
peroxidase/diaminobenzidine)
• Antigen retrieval solution
• IHC staining system (automated or manual)
• Slides, cover slips, and mounting medium
• Positive and negative control slides
1. PROCEDURE
A. Sectioning
1. Cut 4-5 µm thick sections from each FFPE tissue block using a
microtome.
2. Float sections on a water bath at 40-45°C and mount on
positively charged microscope slides.
3. Dry slides in an oven at 60°C for 1 hour.
B. Deparaffinization and Rehydration
1. Deparaffinize slides by soaking in xylene or a xylene substitute,
2 changes, 5 minutes each.
2. Rehydrate slides through a graded series of ethanol (100%,
95%, 70%) followed by distilled water.
C. Antigen Retrieval
1. Place slides in an antigen retrieval solution (pH 6.0 citrate buffer
or pH 9.0 Tris-EDTA buffer as specified by the antibody
manufacturer).
2. Perform heat-induced epitope retrieval using a microwave,
pressure cooker, or water bath as per manufacturer's
instructions.
D. Staining
1. Rinse slides in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or Tris-buffered
saline (TBS).
2. Block endogenous peroxidase activity by incubating slides in a
hydrogen peroxide solution for 10 minutes.
3. Rinse slides in PBS/TBS.
4. Apply ALK primary antibody to each slide and incubate for the
time and temperature specified by the manufacturer.
5. Wash slides in PBS/TBS.
6. Apply the secondary antibody conjugated with HRP and
incubate as per manufacturer’s instructions.
7. Wash slides in PBS/TBS.
8. Add DAB chromogen and incubate until the desired staining
intensity is achieved (usually 5-10 minutes).
9. Wash slides in distilled water.
E. Counterstaining and Mounting
1. Counterstain slides with hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes.
2. Rinse slides in tap water and differentiate in mild acid ethanol if
necessary.
3. Dehydrate slides through graded ethanol solutions and clear in
xylene.
4. Mount slides with a permanent mounting medium and cover
slips.
F. Quality Control
1. Include positive and negative control slides with each batch of
patient samples.
2. Verify that the positive control demonstrates the expected
staining pattern and the negative control shows no staining.
3. Document any deviations and corrective actions taken.
4. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
• Examine stained slides under a microscope.
• ALK-positive tumors will show granular cytoplasmic staining in
tumor cells.
• The pathologist or trained personnel will assess staining intensity
and distribution, reporting the results as positive or negative for
ALK expression.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results should be documented in the laboratory information
system (LIS).
• Report results to the referring physician, including the staining
pattern and any pertinent observations related to the assay
controls.
• Ensure that critical or unexpected results are communicated to
the clinician in a timely manner.
1. REFERENCES
• Relevant literature and manufacturer’s instructions for ALK IHC
reagents and kits.
By adhering to this SOP, the laboratory ensures consistent and
accurate results for the detection of ALK in lung cancer specimens
using IHC. Regular review and updates to this SOP will be performed
to keep up with advancements and new guidelines in the field.
