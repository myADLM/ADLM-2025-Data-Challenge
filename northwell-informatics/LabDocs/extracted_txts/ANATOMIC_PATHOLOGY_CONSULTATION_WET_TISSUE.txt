Standard Operating Procedure for Anatomic Pathology
Consultation, Wet Tissue
1. PURPOSE
To provide a uniform and standardized procedure for the processing
and reporting of anatomic pathology consultations from wet tissue
specimens. This SOP ensures accurate diagnoses and high-quality
pathological evaluations.
Responsibility:
Designated pathology staff, including pathologists, pathologist
assistants, and histotechnologists are responsible for following this
procedure. It is the responsibility of all laboratory staff to ensure the
integrity of specimens and the accuracy of results.
2. DEFINITION
Anatomic pathology consultation involves the examination and
diagnosis of tissue samples by a pathologist. Wet tissue samples are
fresh or fixed tissues sent for consultation.
3. PROCEDURE
A) Receipt and Accessioning of Wet Tissue Specimens:
1. Check Specimen Integrity and Labeling:
◦ Verify that all specimens are properly labeled with the
patient’s name, specimen type, and collection date.
◦ Ensure that the accompanying requisition form is complete
and matches the specimen details.
2. Accessioning:
◦ Assign a unique accession number to each specimen upon
receipt.
◦ Log specimen details, including patient information,
specimen type, and accession number, into the laboratory
information system (LIS).
B) Gross Examination:
1. Preparation:
◦ Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE),
including gloves, lab coat, and face shield.
◦ Ensure that the grossing station is clean and ready for use.
2. Gross Examination and Description:
◦ Perform a thorough visual and manual examination of the
tissue.
◦ Measure the specimen dimensions, describe the color,
consistency, and any notable features.
◦ Record findings in the LIS or gross examination log.
3. Sectioning and Fixation of Tissue:
◦ Select representative sections from the gross specimen.
◦ Place tissue sections in appropriately labeled cassettes.
◦ Fix tissue sections in formalin or other suitable fixative as
specified in the laboratory's fixation protocol.
C) Tissue Processing, Embedding, and Sectioning:
1. Tissue Processing:
◦ Load cassettes into the tissue processor according to the
laboratory’s tissue processing schedule.
◦ Process tissues overnight or according to the protocol to
ensure proper dehydration, clearing, and infiltration with
paraffin.
2. Embedding:
◦ Embed processed tissue sections in paraffin blocks,
ensuring correct orientation.
◦ Label paraffin blocks with the accession number and
relevant specimen details.
3. Sectioning:
◦ Section paraffin blocks using a microtome to obtain thin
tissue slices (4–5 micrometers thick).
◦ Float sections on a water bath and mount them on labeled
glass slides.
◦ Dry slides in a slide dryer or oven to secure sections to the
slides.
D) Staining:
1. Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) Staining:
◦ Stain sections using the standard H&E staining protocol.
◦ Dehydrate stained sections, clear in xylene, and cover slip
with a suitable mounting medium.
2. Special Stains and Immunohistochemistry (if needed):
◦ Perform special stains or immunohistochemistry according
to specific diagnostic requirements.
◦ Document any additional stains or procedures in the LIS.
E) Microscopic Examination and Diagnosis:
1. Pathologist Review:
◦ Pathologist examines the stained slides under a
microscope.
◦ Document diagnostic findings, including any histological
abnormalities, in the LIS.
◦ Correlate with clinical history and gross examination findings
if applicable.
2. Consultation and Second Opinion (if needed):
◦ Obtain a second opinion or consultation from another
pathologist if required.
◦ Document any additional opinions or consultations in the
LIS.
F) Reporting Results:
1. Report Generation:
◦ Generate a detailed pathology report based on microscopic
findings.
◦ Include diagnosis, description of findings, and any
recommendations.
2. Report Verification and Approval:
◦ Review and verify the report for accuracy and
completeness.
◦ Approve the final report in the LIS.
3. Dissemination:
◦ Send the final report to the requesting physician or clinician.
◦ Ensure that the report is also stored and accessible in the
LIS for future reference.
G) Quality Control and Record Keeping:
1. Quality Control:
◦ Perform internal quality checks on tissue processing,
staining, and reporting.
◦ Address any discrepancies or quality issues immediately.
2. Record Keeping:
◦ Ensure all documentation, including gross examination
notes, microscopic findings, and final reports, are
maintained according to regulatory and institutional
requirements.
◦ Store wet tissue specimens, paraffin blocks, and slides
appropriately for the required retention period.
