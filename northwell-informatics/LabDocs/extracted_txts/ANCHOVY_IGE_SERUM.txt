Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Measurement of Serum
IgE Levels
1. PURPOSE To provide a standardized procedure for the accurate
and precise quantification of Immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels in serum
to aid in the diagnosis and monitoring of allergic diseases.
2. SCOPE This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel
performing serum IgE testing in the laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY It is the responsibility of trained laboratory
personnel to perform the assay following this SOP, record all findings
meticulously, and inform the supervisor of any deviations or unusual
findings.
4. DEFINITION IgE: Immunoglobulin E, an antibody associated with
allergic reactions. Serum: The clear, yellowish fluid component of
blood that remains after clotting factors and blood cells have been
removed.
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Accepted Specimen:
• 5 mL of serum collected in a Serological Tube (Red-top or SST
tube).
• Serum samples should be separated from cells as soon as
possible, typically within 2 hours of collection.
• Store specimens at 2-8°C if analysis is not performed
immediately. For long-term storage, freeze samples at -20°C or
lower.
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic or icteric samples.
• Specimens collected in improper containers or exceeding
respecified storage duration.
6. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Automated Immunoassay Analyzer (e.g., ELISA,
Chemiluminescent Immunoassay platform)
• Calibrated Micropipettes and Tips
• IgE Calibrators and Controls
• IgE Assay Kit (including necessary reagents)
• Serum Separator Tubes (SST)
• Centrifuge for serum separation
• Storage Refrigerator (2-8°C)
• Freezer (-20°C or lower)
• Laboratory Timer
• Protective Laboratory Gear (Gloves, Lab Coat, Safety Glasses)
7. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Verification and Preparation of Equipment:
◦ Turn on the automated immunoassay analyzer and allow it
to warm up to the required operating temperature.
◦ Check that reagents and controls are within their expiration
dates and stored according to manufacturer instruction.
◦ Perform daily instrument maintenance and calibration as per
manufacturer's recommendations.
2. Sample Preparation:
◦ Allow refrigerated serum samples to come to room
temperature.
◦ Mix samples thoroughly by gentle inversion.
Analysis:
1. Loading Samples:
◦ Label sample tubes clearly with the patient identification
number and test to be performed.
◦ Pipette the specified volume of the serum sample,
calibrators, and controls into the respective wells or sample
cups of the immunoassay analyzer.
2. Running the Assay:
◦ Add necessary reagents according to the kit instructions.
◦ Initiate the assay sequence on the immunoassay analyzer.
◦ Record the start time and allow the analyzer to process the
samples.
3. Result Calculation:
◦ The analyzer will measure the optical density or
chemiluminescent signal and calculate the IgE
concentration using the calibration curve provided by the
calibrators.
8. QUALITY CONTROL AND VALIDATION
1. Quality Control:
◦ Run assay controls (positive and negative) with every batch
of samples to verify assay accuracy.
◦ Confirm that control values fall within the specified ranges. If
controls are out of range, do not report patient results until
the issue is resolved.
2. Result Validation:
◦ Review results for control samples and patient tests.
◦ Re-run any outlier or questionable results.
◦ Validate results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
9. REPORTING RESULTS
• Verified results are automatically transmitted to the LIS.
• Ensure all results, including critical values, comply with reporting
guidelines and are communicated promptly to the requesting
clinician.
10. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's kit insert and reagent guidelines.
• Laboratory internal quality control procedures.
11. DOCUMENTATION
• Record all observations, anomalies, and corrective actions in the
laboratory logbook.
• Maintain a Sample Processing and Result Reporting Log as per
laboratory policy.
12. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS
• Follow laboratory biosafety guidelines, including the use of
personal protective equipment.
• Handle all biological specimens as potentially infectious.
13. TROUBLESHOOTING
• For any instrument failure or deviation in control ranges, refer to
the troubleshooting section of the instrument and reagents
manual.
• Notify laboratory supervisor and seek further troubleshooting
assistance as needed.
14. MAINTENANCE
• Instrument maintenance should be performed as per the
Manufacturer’s instructions and recorded in the maintenance log.
