Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Androgen Receptor
Immunostain – Technical Component Only
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedures required for the
technical component of generating results for the Androgen Receptor
(AR) Immunostain analysis. This includes the pre-analytic setup,
analytic steps, and post-analytic quality control measures essential
for accurate and reproducible results.
2. DEFINITIONS
Androgen Receptor (AR) Immunostain: An immunohistochemical
staining technique used to detect the presence of androgen receptors
in tissue specimens, mainly utilized for diagnostic purposes in
pathology.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue block.
• Acceptable: Unstained slides (4-5 µm thick) mounted on positively
charged glass slides.
• Unacceptable: Improperly fixed or processed tissue, broken
slides, or slides with insufficient tissue.
4. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• Primary antibody against AR (validated for
immunohistochemistry).
• Secondary antibody (HRP-conjugated).
• Detection system (e.g., DAB substrate).
• Positive and negative control tissues.
• Antigen retrieval solution.
• Blocking solution.
• Mounting medium.
• Counterstain (e.g., hematoxylin).
• Wash buffer (e.g., PBS/TBS).
• Xylene and ethanol series for deparaffinization and rehydration.
5. EQUIPMENT
• Microtome.
• Slide warmer.
• Humidity chamber or similar device.
• Staining jars or automated staining system.
• Light microscope.
6. PROCEDURE
6.1 Pre-Analytic Preparation:
1. Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
◦ Place slides in a 60°C oven for 1 hour.
◦ Deparaffinize slides in three changes of xylene, 5 minutes
each.
◦ Rehydrate slides through a graded ethanol series (100%,
95%, 80%, and 70% ethanol), 3 minutes each.
2. Antigen Retrieval:
◦ Perform antigen retrieval using the appropriate solution
(e.g., citrate buffer, pH 6.0) in a microwave, pressure cooker,
or specified retrieval device according to optimized protocol
(e.g., 10 minutes at sub-boiling temperature).
◦ Allow slides to cool in retrieval solution to room temperature
and then wash in wash buffer.
6.2 Analytic Staining:
1. Blocking:
◦ Incubate slides in blocking solution (e.g., 5% normal serum)
for 10 minutes to reduce non-specific binding.
2. Primary Antibody Incubation:
◦ Incubate slides with appropriately diluted primary AR
antibody in a humidity chamber for the recommended time
(e.g., 30 minutes to 1 hour).
3. Washing:
◦ Wash slides in wash buffer for 5 minutes, 3 times.
4. Secondary Antibody Incubation:
◦ Apply secondary antibody and incubate for 30 minutes in a
humidity chamber.
5. Washing:
◦ Wash slides again in wash buffer for 5 minutes, 3 times.
6. Detection:
◦ Incubate slides with DAB substrate or equivalent chromogen
solution until desired staining intensity is achieved (monitor
under a microscope).
7. Counterstaining:
◦ Counterstain slides with hematoxylin for 30 seconds to 1
minute.
◦ Rinse in tap water and perform a brief differentiating step in
acid alcohol (if required).
◦ Rinse again in tap water and blue in slightly alkaline
solution.
8. Dehydration and Mounting:
◦ Dehydrate slides through graded ethanol series (70%, 80%,
95%, and 100% ethanol).
◦ Clear in xylene, mount with suitable mounting medium, and
cover with a coverslip.
6.3 Post-Analytic Quality Control:
1. Review:
◦ Examine slides under a light microscope to ensure
appropriate staining and specificity.
◦ Confirm the presence or absence of AR staining in the
positive control tissue.
◦ Verify lack of staining in the negative control tissue.
2. Documentation:
◦ Record staining procedure details, batch numbers of
reagents, and controls used in laboratory records/logbook.
◦ Record any deviations from the protocol or observed issues.
3. Reporting:
◦ Technical staff to document the technical findings and
forward the slides to the pathologist for interpretation and
final report generation.

reviewing procedure adherence, investigating deviations, and
implementing corrective actions if required.
9. REVIEW
• This SOP is to be reviewed annually or whenever procedural or
technical updates are required.
