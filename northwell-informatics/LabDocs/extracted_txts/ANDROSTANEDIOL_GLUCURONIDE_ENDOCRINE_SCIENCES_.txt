Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Protocol for the Analytical Phase of Generating Results for
Androstanediol Glucuronide (Endocrine Sciences)
1. PURPOSE
To establish a standardized method for the analytical phase of testing
Androstanediol Glucuronide to ensure accuracy, precision, and
reliability of test results.
Responsibility:
• It is the responsibility of designated laboratory staff to perform and
document all steps outlined in this procedure.
• It is the responsibility of supervisory staff to review data, ensure
protocol compliance, and address any deviations or issues.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type:
• Serum or Plasma
Specimen Collection:
• Preferred: Serum collected in a red-top tube.
• Acceptable: Plasma collected in a heparin (green-top) or EDTA
(purple-top) tube.
• Volume: Minimum 1 mL.
• Note: Serum or plasma must be separated from cells as soon as
possible, preferably within 2 hours of collection.
Specimen Stability:
• Room Temperature: 24 hours
• Refrigerated (2-8°C): 7 days
• Frozen (-20°C or colder): 30 days
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
• Samples not stored appropriately as per stated stability
conditions.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• LC-MS/MS system
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes and tips
• Mobile phase solvents (e.g., water, acetonitrile, formic acid)
• Calibrators and controls specific for Androstanediol Glucuronide
• Analytical columns
• Sample vials and caps
• Nitrogen gas supply
4. CALIBRATION AND QUALITY CONTROL
Calibration Standards:
• Prepare calibration standards at defined concentrations for
Androstanediol Glucuronide.
• Store standards as per manufacturer’s instructions, documenting
preparation date and expiration.
Quality Control (QC) Materials:
• Use two levels of QC materials (low and high).
• Run QC samples daily before patient samples to ensure
instrument accuracy.
5. SAMPLE PREPARATION
1. Centrifugation:
◦ Centrifuge specimens at 1500 g for 10 minutes at room
temperature.
2. Transfer:
◦ Transfer the serum or plasma into labeled secondary tubes.
3. Extraction:
◦ Follow the designated extraction procedure for
Androstanediol Glucuronide as specified in the kit/package
insert.
4. Drying and Reconstitution:
◦ Dry the extracted sample under nitrogen gas.
◦ Reconstitute with the mobile phase.
6. INSTRUMENT SETUP AND OPERATION
LC-MS/MS Setup:
1. Column Installation:
◦ Install and equilibrate the appropriate analytical column.
2. Mobile Phase Preparation:
◦ Prepare and degas mobile phase solvents.
3. Instrument Calibration:
◦ Calibrate the LC-MS/MS system using the calibration
standards.
◦ Ensure system suitability prior to sample analysis.
4. Software Setup:
◦ Input sample list, including calibration standards, QC
samples, and patient samples.
◦ Define the method parameters for monitoring
Androstanediol Glucuronide.
7. SAMPLE ANALYSIS
1. Injection:
◦ Inject standards, QC samples, and patient samples
sequentially.
2. Data Acquisition:
◦ Ensure proper data acquisition and peak integration.
◦ Review real-time data for any system errors or anomalies.
8. RESULTS REVIEW
1. Calibration Curve:
◦ Verify that the calibration curve meets acceptable criteria for
linearity.
◦ Recalibrate if necessary.
2. QC Evaluation:
◦ Confirm that QC sample results are within acceptable limits.
◦ Investigate and resolve QC failures prior to releasing patient
results.
3. Patient Results:
◦ Review and validate all patient results.
◦ Flag and investigate any results that fall outside reference
ranges or show other anomalies.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Data Entry:
◦ Enter validated results into the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
2. Result Verification:
◦ Ensure results are reviewed and electronically signed by
authorized personnel.
3. Reporting:
◦ Provide results in a clear, concise format, including
reference ranges and any applicable comments.
10. METHOD LIMITATIONS AND INTERFERENCES
• Ensure awareness of potential interferences and assay
sensitivities as indicated in the assay kit/package insert.
11. REFERENCES
• Refer to applicable Androstanediol Glucuronide assay kit/package
inserts for specific reagent and procedure details.
