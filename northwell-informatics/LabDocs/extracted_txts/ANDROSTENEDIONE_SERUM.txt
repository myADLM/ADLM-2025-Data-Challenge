Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Androstenedione, Serum
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for the accurate and reliable measurement
of androstenedione levels in serum samples.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all personnel involved in the process of
analyzing serum samples for androstenedione levels in the
laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
Laboratory personnel are responsible for following this SOP to
ensure the accuracy and validity of the results. Supervisory
personnel are responsible for ensuring compliance and addressing
any non-conformities.
4. DEFINITIONS
Androstenedione: A steroid hormone used as a marker for adrenal or
gonadal function.
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Serum.
• Collection: Collect at least 2 mL blood into a SST (serum
separator tube).
• Handling: Allow the blood to clot at room temperature for 30-60
minutes. Centrifuge the SST tube for 10 minutes at 1300-1500 g
to separate serum.
• Storage: Separate serum must be stored at 2-8°C if analysis will
be completed within 48 hours. For longer storage, freeze serum at
-20°C or lower.
• Transport: Transport serum to the laboratory on ice (2-8°C if
within 48 hours, freeze if longer duration).
6. EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS
• Reagent kits for androstenedione (e.g., ELISA kit specific for
serum androstenedione)
• Calibrated pipettes and tips
• Microplate reader (if using ELISA)
• Centrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Timer
• Laboratory computer system for data entry and reporting
7. CALIBRATION AND QUALITY CONTROL
• Calibrate pipettes and microplate reader per manufacturer’s
instructions.
• Perform quality control procedures with low, medium, and high
androgen controls with every batch of samples.
• Ensure that quality control results are within acceptable ranges
before analyzing patient samples.
• Document quality control and calibration checks in the appropriate
logs.
8. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation
1. Bring all reagents, controls, and patient samples to room
temperature before starting the assay.
2. Perform a brief vortex mix of patient and control samples prior
to pipetting.
B. Assay Procedure (Using ELISA Method as an Example)
1. Set Up:
◦ Label sufficient microplate wells for standards, controls, and
patient samples in duplicates.
2. Pipetting:
◦ Pipette 50 μL of standards, controls, and patient samples
into the designated wells.
3. Addition of Reagents:
◦ Add 50 μL of enzyme conjugate reagent to each well and
mix thoroughly by gently tapping the side of the plate.
4. Incubation:
◦ Incubate the plate at room temperature for 60 minutes.
5. Washing:
◦ Wash the wells 3-5 times with the provided wash buffer
using an automatic plate washer or manual washing
technique.
6. Substrate Reaction:
◦ Add 50 μL of substrate solution to each well and incubate in
the dark at room temperature for 15-20 minutes.
7. Stopping Reaction:
◦ Add 50 μL of stop solution to each well, ensuring thorough
mixing.
8. Reading the Plate:
◦ Read the absorbance of each well at 450 nm using a
microplate reader within 10 minutes of stopping the reaction.
C. Calculations and Interpretation
1. Standard Curve:
◦ Construct a standard curve by plotting the absorbance of
the standards against their known concentrations.
2. Sample Concentration:
◦ Calculate the concentration of androstenedione in patient
samples by interpolating from the standard curve.
◦ Document results and ensure internal control ranges are
met.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
• Document results in the laboratory information system (LIS).
• Review and verify results considering quality control data.
• Flag any abnormal or critical values as per laboratory protocols.
10. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
• Normal reference range for androstenedione in serum should be
referenced from the specific kit used, as ranges may differ.
11. QUALITY ASSURANCE
• Ensure that each new lot of reagents is verified against previous
lots before use in patient testing.
• Perform regular proficiency testing and participate in external
quality assessment schemes.
12. TROUBLESHOOTING
• Re-run patient samples if internal controls fail.
• Verify instrument calibration if results are inconsistent.
• Consult the supervisor for persistent issues.
13. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions for the specific ELISA kits.
• Laboratory quality management guidelines.
• Relevant clinical guidelines for androstenedione measurement.
14. DOCUMENTATION
• All steps performed, quality control results, and any deviations
from the SOP should be logged in the appropriate records.
By following this SOP, the laboratory ensures the measurement
accuracy of serum androstenedione, supporting clinical decisions
based on valid results.
