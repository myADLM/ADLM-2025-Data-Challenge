Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) for the Analytical Phase
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this document is to establish the Standard Operating
Procedures (SOP) for the analytical phase of generating results for
ANGIOSARCOMA, MYC (8Q24) Amplification using Fluorescence In
Situ Hybridization (FISH) on tissue samples. The aim is to ensure
accuracy, reliability, and consistency in test results.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all personnel who are responsible for performing
the analytical phase of the ANGIOSARCOMA, MYC (8Q24)
Amplification FISH test in the laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• It is the responsibility of qualified laboratory personnel to perform
the procedures as outlined in this SOP.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring that the personnel are
adequately trained and competent to perform the tests.
• All staff must identify any issues that may affect the quality of
results and report them immediately to supervisors.
4. DEFINITIONS
• FISH (Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization): A laboratory
technique used to detect and localize the presence or absence of
specific DNA sequences on chromosomes.
• MYC (8q24) Amplification: An increase in the number of copies
of the MYC gene located on chromosome 8q24, which can be
indicative of angiosarcoma.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• FISH probe specific for MYC gene region (8q24)
• Tissue samples (formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded)
• Microtome
• Heat block
• Water bath
• Fluorescence microscope
• Hybridization buffer
• Denaturation solution
• Wash buffers (SSC buffer: 2X SSC, 0.1% NP-40)
• DAPI counterstain
• Coverslips
• Immersion oil
• Thermometer
• FISH Hybridization System (e.g., ThermoBrite System)
• Calibrated pipettes and tips
• Humidified chamber
6. PROCEDURE
6.1. Pre-Hybridization Preparation
1. Sectioning:
◦ Cut 4-5 µm thick sections of the formalin-fixed, paraffin-
embedded tissue block using a microtome.
◦ Mount sections onto positively charged glass slides.
2. Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
◦ Deparaffinize the tissue sections by immersing slides in
xylene for 10 minutes twice.
◦ Rehydrate in a series of ethanol concentrations (100%,
95%, 70%) for 3 minutes each.
3. Pretreatment:
◦ Treat slides in a pre-warmed 0.2N HCl solution for 20
minutes to remove formalin-induced cross-links.
◦ Wash in distilled water followed by immersion in protein-
digesting enzyme solution (e.g., pepsin) at 37°C for 10
minutes.
◦ Rinse slides in distilled water.
6.2. Hybridization
1. Denaturation:
◦ Place slides in denaturation solution (70% formamide/2X
SSC) at 73°C for 5 minutes.
◦ Immediately transfer slides to ice-cold 70% ethanol for 5
minutes to stop the reaction.
2. Probe Preparation:
◦ Pre-warm the FISH probe mix containing the MYC probe
according to the manufacturer's instructions.
3. Application of Probe:
◦ Apply 10 μL of denatured probe mixture to each slide and
cover with a coverslip.
◦ Seal the coverslips with rubber cement to prevent drying.
4. Hybridization:
◦ Place slides in a humidified chamber at 37°C for 16-24
hours to allow for hybridization.
6.3. Post-Hybridization Washes
1. Stringency Washes:
◦ Remove coverslip and wash slides in 2X SSC/0.3% NP40 at
73°C for 2 minutes.
◦ Wash slides in 2X SSC/0.1% NP40 at room temperature for
1 minute.
2. Counterstaining:
◦ Apply 10 μL of DAPI counterstain to each slide and cover
with a new coverslip.
◦ Allow slides to air dry in the dark.
6.4. Microscopy and Analysis
1. Imaging:
◦ Examine the slides under a fluorescence microscope
equipped with appropriate filters for detecting DAPI and
MYC probe signals.
◦ Analyze at least 100 interphase nuclei to assess the
presence of MYC amplification.
2. Interpretation:
◦ MYC amplification is defined as a MYC/CEP8 ratio ≥ 2.0 or
the presence of ≥ 6 MYC signals per nucleus in at least 10%
of analyzed cells.
◦ Ensure quality control by comparing results with known
positive and negative controls.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include positive and negative control slides with each run.
• Document the lot numbers and expiration dates of all reagents
and probes.
• Calibration and maintenance of the fluorescence microscope
must be performed as per manufacturer’s guidelines.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Document and review raw data including images of FISH signals.
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS) after
verification by a qualified technologist.
• Report MYC amplification status along with the total number of
cells analyzed, the number of cells with amplified signals, and the
MYC/CEP8 ratio.
9. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions for the MYC FISH probe kit.
• Clinical guidelines and publications on the FISH methodology for
MYC amplification detection in angiosarcoma.
10. ATTACHMENTS
• Temperature logs for equipment.
• Equipment maintenance records.
• Quality control logs.
