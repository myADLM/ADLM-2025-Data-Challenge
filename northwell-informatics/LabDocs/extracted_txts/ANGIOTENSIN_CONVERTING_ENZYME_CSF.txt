Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) for the Analytical Phase
of Generating Results for Angiotensin Converting Enzyme
(ACE), CSF
1. PURPOSE
This document provides standardized procedures for the analysis of
Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in
order to ensure accurate and reproducible results. It outlines the
steps necessary for the preparation, processing, and analysis of
specimens as well as the documentation and reporting of ACE levels
in CSF samples.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the laboratory personnel to adhere to this
procedure. Laboratory staff must be trained and proficient in handling
CSF samples, operating the required analytical instruments,
performing the tests, and ensuring proper documentation and
reporting according to established laboratory protocols.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND MATERIALS
Equipment:
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes (adjustable)
• Vortex mixer
• Refrigerator and freezer (-20°C and -80°C)
• Analytical balance
• ACE assay kit
• Spectrophotometer or fluorometer
• Computer with Laboratory Information System (LIS)
Reagents:
• ACE assay reagent kit (store as per manufacturer's instructions)
• Calibration standards
• Quality control materials (2 levels: normal and abnormal)
Materials:
• CSF collection tubes
• Disposable gloves
• Sample tubes and cryovials
• Laboratory coat
• Laboratory logbook for specimen documentation
4. PROCEDURE
Specimen Requirements:
• Acceptable:
◦ CSF samples collected in sterile, leak-proof containers.
◦ Specimens should be transported to the laboratory on ice and
processed within 1 hour of collection.
◦ Specimens may be stored at 4°C for up to 24 hours or at
-80°C for longer periods if processing will be delayed.
• Unacceptable:
◦ Samples with visible hemolysis or contamination.
◦ Specimens not properly labeled or lacking collection
information.
Specimen Preparation:
1. Upon receipt, document the specimen details in the laboratory
logbook, including patient identification, date and time of
collection, and collector’s information.
2. Centrifuge the CSF sample at 1500 x g for 10 minutes at 4°C to
remove any particulate matter.
3. Aliquot the supernatant into pre-labeled cryovials for analysis
and any necessary storage.
ACE Assay Procedure:
1. Preparation:
◦ Thaw samples and quality control materials if stored frozen,
and bring them to room temperature.
◦ Set up the spectrophotometer or fluorometer according to
the manufacturer’s instructions specific to the ACE assay.
2. Calibration and QC:
◦ Prepare calibration standards as detailed in the ACE assay
kit manual.
◦ Run a complete calibration at the beginning of each assay
batch.
◦ Analyze quality control materials at two levels (normal and
abnormal) with each batch to ensure assay accuracy and
precision.
◦ Verify that QC results are within acceptable ranges before
proceeding with patient sample analysis.
3. Sample Analysis:
◦ Add the appropriate volume of CSF sample to the assay
wells or test tubes as specified by the assay protocol.
◦ Add the assay reagents to each well or tube according to
the manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Incubate the reaction mixture for the required time and
temperature as outlined in the kit instructions.
◦ Measure the absorbance or fluorescence of each sample at
the specified wavelength using the spectrophotometer or
fluorometer.
4. Calculations and Reporting:
◦ Calculate the ACE concentration in each CSF sample based
on the calibration curve generated from the standards.
◦ Enter the calculated results into the LIS while ensuring all
patient information is accurately matched.
◦ Review data for consistency and accuracy before verifying
and releasing results.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Quality control materials should be analyzed with each batch of
patient samples.
2. Document all QC results and investigate any out-of-range
values before proceeding with patient sample analysis.
3. Perform instrument maintenance and calibration as
recommended by the manufacturer to ensure optimal
performance.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Results will be transmitted from the spectrophotometer or
fluorometer to the laboratory information system (LIS) for
review.
2. The technologist must review and verify results in the LIS
ensuring all data is accurate before releasing the final report.
3. Any critical or abnormal results must be communicated to the
appropriate healthcare provider as per laboratory policy.
7. METHOD LIMITATIONS
1. Interference from hemolyzed or contaminated specimens may
affect assay accuracy.
2. Ensure assay-specific reagents and instruments are used
consistently for reliable results.
3. Refer to the ACE assay kit insert for specific reagent limitations
and troubleshooting.
