Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE),
Serum
1. PURPOSE
To outline the standardized procedure for the quantification of
Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE) levels in serum to ensure
accurate and reliable results.
Responsibility:
Laboratory scientists are responsible for performing the analysis
according to this SOP. It is the responsibility of the laboratory
manager or designated supervisor to ensure all equipment and
reagents are properly maintained and quality control measures are
strictly followed.
1. DEFINITION
Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE) is an enzyme that converts
angiotensin I to the vasoconstrictor angiotensin II. The serum ACE
level is often measured to diagnose and monitor sarcoidosis and
other conditions.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred Specimen: Serum Volumes: Minimum volume of 1 mL is
required. Specimen Stability: Serum should be analyzed within 48
hours if stored at 4°C. If not analyzed within this time frame, freeze
the serum sample at -20°C or lower.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
a. Equipment:
• Spectrophotometer or automated chemistry analyzer capable of
reading at specified wavelength
• Calibrated micropipettes
• Centrifuge
• Refrigerated storage unit
b. Reagents:
• ACE Substrate solution
• ACE Enzyme Reagent
• Calibrator solution
• Control serum levels (normal and abnormal control)
• Dilution buffer
• Manufacturer-provided reagents if using a kit
c. Supplies:
• Test tubes
• Micropipette tips
• Disposable gloves
• Laboratory-grade water
1. PROCEDURE
2. Preparation: a. Allow all reagents and specimens to come to
room temperature before use. b. Thoroughly mix and centrifuge
serum samples if they have been stored refrigerated or frozen.
Ensure samples are clear and free of particulates.
3. Calibration: a. Perform calibration of the spectrophotometer or
automated analyzer according to the manufacturer's
instructions using the calibrator solution. b. Ensure that
calibration results fall within the acceptable range prior to
proceeding with patient samples.
4. Quality Control: a. Run quality control samples (normal and
abnormal control) prior to analyzing patient specimens. b. Verify
that QC results are within the established acceptable range.
5. Sample Analysis: a. Label all test tubes with unique identifiers
corresponding to each patient sample. b. Add a specific volume
(e.g., 50 µL) of the patient serum to each test tube. c. Add an
appropriate volume of ACE Substrate solution to each tube. d.
Incubate the mixture at 37°C for the time specified in the
reagent kit (e.g., 15 minutes). e. After incubation, stop the
reaction by adding ACE Enzyme Reagent. f. Mix thoroughly and
transfer the contents to the appropriate cuvettes/tubes for
spectrophotometric analysis. g. Measure the absorbance at the
specified wavelength (e.g., 405 nm).
6. Calculation of Results: a. Convert the absorbance readings into
ACE concentrations using the calibration curve. b. Verify that
the analyte concentrations fall within the assay's linear range.
Re-analyze samples requiring dilution.
7. Data Documentation: a. Document all results in the Laboratory
Information System (LIS). b. Review and validate test results by
the technologist. c. Report critical values according to
laboratory policy.
8. TROUBLESHOOTING
9. If a calibration fails, repeat the calibration process. Ensure that
all standards and calibrators are correctly prepared.
10. If QC samples are out of range, re-run QC. Investigate potential
issues with reagents or equipment if problems persist.
11. If sample results are flagged with error messages, assess
sample integrity (e.g., hemolysis) and re-analyze if necessary.
12. REPORTING RESULTS
13. Results are to be reviewed and verified by the technologist for
accuracy before reporting.
14. Document results in the LIS according to site-specific reporting
guidelines.
15. For critical values, follow the established protocol in the
laboratory's critical value policy.
16. METHOD LIMITATIONS
This assay may be affected by hemolysis, lipemia, and icterus.
Presence of interfering substances, such as certain medications,
could give erroneous results. Consult the reagent insert for specific
details on potential interferences.
