STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE
1. PURPOSE
To establish a standardized procedure for the analysis of Angiotensin
I Converting Enzyme (ACE) in serum or plasma specimens in a
clinical laboratory setting.
Responsibility:
Laboratory technologists are responsible for performing the analysis,
documenting results, and maintaining equipment as per this SOP.
Supervisors are responsible for ensuring compliance with the
procedure and addressing any issues that may arise.
1. PRINCIPLE
The ACE assay is based on a fluorometric method which measures
the conversion of an ACE-specific substrate into a fluorogenic
product. This product is quantified using a fluorometer, and the
concentration of ACE is determined by comparing the signal to a
calibration curve.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Acceptable Specimens:
• Serum samples obtained from whole blood collected in red-top
tubes (not gel-separator tubes).
• Plasma samples obtained from whole blood collected in EDTA
(lavender-top) or heparin (green-top) tubes.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, icteric, or lipemic samples.
• Whole blood, clotted blood, or samples collected in tubes
containing additives other than EDTA or heparin.
Specimen Handling and Stability:
• Serum or plasma must be separated from cells within 2 hours of
collection.
• Stored at 2-8°C if analyzed within 24 hours; otherwise, freeze at
-20°C.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Fluorometer compatible with the ACE assay.
• ACE assay reagent kits (including fluorogenic substrate,
calibrators, and controls).
• Pipettes and pipette tips.
• Calibrated centrifuge.
• Sample tubes.
• Vortex mixer.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
Materials:
• Commercially available quality control (QC) samples at different
ACE concentration levels (e.g., low, medium, high).
• QC samples should be tested with each batch of patient samples.
Procedure:
• QC samples should be treated the same as patient samples.
• If QC results fall outside the established acceptable range, the run
must be invalidated, equipment recalibrated, and all samples re-
analyzed after resolving the issue.
1. PROCEDURE
Sample Preparation:
1. Allow all samples and reagents to reach room temperature.
2. Mix patient samples, calibrators, and controls using a vortex
mixer.
Assay Protocol:
1. Calibration:
• Prepare a calibration curve using the provided calibrators.
• Follow the manufacturer's instructions for preparing and loading
calibrators into the fluorometer.
1. Sample and Control Preparation:
• Pipette the required volume of sample, control, or calibrator into
corresponding wells or cuvettes.
• Add the ACE reagent mix (as per the kit instructions) to each well/
cuvette.
• Mix gently and incubate at the specified temperature/time.
1. Measurement:
• Load the samples into the fluorometer.
• Measure the fluorescence according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
• Calculate the ACE activity based on the calibration curve.
1. CALCULATIONS
• Use the calibration curve to determine the ACE activity in patient
samples.
• Record the fluorescence units measured.
• Apply the appropriate mathematical formula for converting
fluorescence units to ACE concentration (provided in the assay
kit).
1. RESULTS REPORTING
• Refer to site-specific reporting guidelines.
• Ensure that results are verified by a licensed technologist before
reporting.
• Report results within the established reference ranges.
• Include any necessary comments or flags for abnormal results.
Reference Intervals:
• The reference range for ACE activity should be established based
on the assay manufacturer's guidelines and verified with internal
laboratory data.
1. INTERFERENCES AND LIMITATIONS
• Ensure that all specimens are free from hemolysis, lipemia, and
turbidity as these can interfere with the assay.
• Follow kit insert limitations and troubleshooting instructions for
specific reagent or equipment issues.
