ANGIOTENSIN I, PLASMA - Standard Operating Protocol (SOP)
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedures for the analysis
of Angiotensin I in plasma, ensuring accuracy, consistency, and
compliance with regulatory standards.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for carrying out this
procedure. It is the duty of all staff to ensure that the analysis is
performed promptly and correctly, with any deviations or issues
reported to the laboratory supervisor.
3. DEFINITIONS
Angiotensin I: A peptide hormone that originates from the renal
system and undergoes further conversion to angiotensin II, which is
associated with blood pressure regulation.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred Specimen: 10 mL of plasma collected in a plastic tube
containing EDTA as an anticoagulant.
• Unacceptable Specimens:
◦ Hemolyzed or lipemic samples.
◦ Samples collected in tubes without EDTA.
◦ Clotted specimens.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Centrifuge
• Micropipettes and tips
• EDTA blood collection tubes
• Angiotensin I ELISA kits
• Plate reader capable of reading absorbance at appropriate
wavelengths
• Reagent reservoirs
• Deionized water
• Plasma separation tubes
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
6. PROCEDURE
6.1 Pre-Analytical Stage
1. Specimen Handling:
◦ Upon receipt, check the specimen for volume, labeling, and
integrity.
◦ Centrifuge the EDTA tubes at 1500 x g for 10 minutes at 4°C
to separate plasma.
◦ Aliquot the plasma into labeled cryogenic tubes and store at
-80°C until analysis.
2. Preparation of Reagents:
◦ Thaw reagents and samples at room temperature before
use.
◦ Prepare all necessary solutions and standards according to
the manufacturer's instructions provided with the ELISA kit.
6.2 Analytical Stage
1. Assay Procedure:
◦ Prepare the plate by adding standards, controls, and patient
samples to the appropriate wells following the ELISA kit
instructions.
◦ Add the enzyme conjugate to each well.
◦ Incubate the plate as specified in the kit instructions,
typically at room temperature for a set period.
◦ Wash the plate using a plate washer or manual wash
protocol sufficiently.
◦ Add the substrate solution to each well and incubate for the
recommended time.
◦ Add the stop solution to each well to halt the reaction.
◦ Measure the absorbance at the specific wavelength using a
plate reader.
6.3 Post-Analytical Stage
1. Data Analysis:
◦ Calculate the concentration of Angiotensin I using the
standard curve generated by the known standards.
◦ Ensure all calculations and data entries are accurate and
verified by a second technologist.
2. Reporting Results:
◦ Enter the results into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
◦ All critical or abnormal results should be flagged and
reported immediately to the requesting clinician per site-
specific protocols.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Internal Controls:
◦ Run quality control samples alongside patient samples to
monitor assay performance.
◦ If control results fall outside the established range,
troubleshoot the assay and rerun if necessary before
reporting patient results.
2. External Quality Assurance:
◦ Periodically participate in external quality assurance
programs to ensure assay validity and accuracy.
8. MAINTENANCE AND TROUBLESHOOTING
1. Maintenance:
◦ Regularly maintain and calibrate all equipment according to
the manufacturer's recommendations.
2. Troubleshooting:
• Common issues include sample hemolysis, improper reagent
storage, and equipment malfunction. Refer to the troubleshooting
guide provided by the ELISA kit manufacturer or laboratory's
standard troubleshooting protocols.
9. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS
1. Biological Safety:
◦ Handle all biological specimens as potentially infectious.
◦ Follow universal precautions and wear appropriate PPE,
including gloves and lab coats, throughout the process.
2. Chemical Safety:
◦ Handle all reagents according to Safety Data Sheets (SDS)
guidelines.
◦ Ensure proper ventilation when handling volatile substances
and dispose of chemical waste appropriately.
