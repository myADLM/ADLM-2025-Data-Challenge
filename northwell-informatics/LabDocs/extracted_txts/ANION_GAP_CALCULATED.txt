Analytical Phase Protocol for
Generating Anion Gap
(Calculated) Results
1. Purpose
The purpose of this protocol is to provide detailed, standardized
procedures for the analytical phase of generating results for anion
gap (calculated). Ensuring consistency, accuracy, and compliance
with established laboratory standards is critical for providing reliable
patient results.
2. Specimen Requirements
• Preferred/acceptable specimens:
◦ Heparinized plasma or serum collected in a heparinized
vacutainer (dark green or PST).
◦ SST (Serum Separator Tube).
3. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies
• Equipment required:
◦ Electrolyte Analyzer (e.g., Roche Cobas, ABL system).
• Reagents:
◦ Calibrated reagents specific to electrolyte measurement (e.g.,
Na+, K+, Cl-, HCO3-).
4. Definitions
• Anion Gap:
◦ Calculated value used to identify the presence of unmeasured
ions in the blood.
◦ Formula: Anion Gap = Na+ - (Cl- + HCO3-).
5. Analytical Procedures
A. Pre-analytical Check:
1. Specimen Verification:
◦ Verify that specimen meets acceptability criteria (refer to
Specimen Requirements).
◦ Ensure specimens are labeled correctly with patient
identification.
2. Specimen Condition:
◦ Visually inspect each specimen for hemolysis or clots.
◦ Ensure that sample integrity is suitable for analysis.
B. Analytical Steps:
1. Equipment Preparation:
◦ Ensure electrolyte analyzer is calibrated correctly.
◦ Verify that reagents are within the expiration date and
properly stored.
2. Quality Control:
◦ Run two levels of QC (Quality Control) material before
patient analysis, following biochemistry laboratory protocols.
◦ Document QC results and ensure they are within acceptable
ranges before proceeding with patient specimen analysis.
3. Specimen Analysis:
◦ Sample Loading:
▪ Load the specimen onto the electrolyte analyzer
according to manufacturer's instructions.
▪ Ensure proper placement and secure loading within the
instrument.
◦ Measurement:
▪ Perform electrolyte measurement for Na+, Cl-, and
HCO3- anions.
▪ Ensure the instrument processes specimens according
to calibration and operational guidelines.
4. Calculation of Anion Gap:
◦ Formula Application:
▪ Automatically or manually calculate the anion gap using
the formula: [ \text{Anion Gap} = \text{Na}^+ - (\text{Cl}^-
+ \text{HCO}_3^-) ]
◦ Verification:
▪ Ensure the calculation is performed accurately. Cross-
verify with manual calculations if necessary.
◦ Reference Range:
▪ Report the value as Anion Gap along with the reference
interval: [ \text{Normal Range:} 8-16 , \text{mmol/L} \text{
(without Potassium)} ]
C. Post-analytical Process:
1. Result Verification:
◦ Review calculated anion gap results for any possible errors
or discrepancies.
◦ Verify calculation integrity against other clinical data if
necessary.
2. Result Documentation:
◦ Document results in the Laboratory Information System
(LIS) and ensure that they are associated correctly with the
patient's records.
3. Critical Results:
◦ Follow critical result reporting policies. Immediate
communication to the attending physician or healthcare
provider if the anion gap is critically high or low.
◦ Critical values:
▪ High Anion Gap: >20 mmol/L
▪ Low Anion Gap: <3 mmol/L
4. Quality Assurance:
◦ Perform periodic comparison studies to ensure continuous
accuracy of analyzers.
◦ Participate in external proficiency testing and inter-
laboratory comparisons.
6. Troubleshooting and Maintenance
1. Instrument Issues:
◦ Follow manufacturer’s instructions for troubleshooting
instrument errors or inconsistencies.
◦ Perform regular maintenance checks and recalibrations as
necessary.
2. Reagent Issues:
◦ Ensure reagents are stored properly post usage.
◦ Replace reagents approaching expiry and manage stocks
efficiently.
