Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analysis: ANISAKIS,
PARASITE, IGE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE To outline the procedure for analyzing Anisakis,
Parasite, IgE in serum samples to ensure accurate and reliable
results are generated for clinical diagnostics.
2. SCOPE This procedure applies to all ANISAKIS, PARASITE, IGE,
SERUM tests performed in the laboratory. It includes the steps from
sample preparation through analysis and result generation.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Trained laboratory technologists are responsible for performing
the assay.
• Supervisors are responsible for overseeing the operations and
ensuring compliance with the procedure.
• Lab personnel are responsible for identifying any issues and
reporting them immediately to a supervisor.
4. DEFINITIONS
• IgE: Immunoglobulin E, an antibody associated with allergic
reactions.
• Anisakis: A type of parasitic worm that can cause anisakiasis in
humans.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• ELISA Reader
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes and tips
• Vortex mixer
• Incubator
Reagents:
• Anisakis-specific IgE ELISA Kit
• Quality Control (QC) materials
• Calibrators
• Washing Buffer
• Substrate Solution
• Stop Solution
Supplies:
• Serum sample tubes
• Microplates
• Microplate Covers
6. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENT
• Preferred specimen: Serum.
• Volume: At least 1 mL of serum is required.
• Stability: Serum specimens are stable for up to 72 hours at 2-8°C.
For long-term storage, serum can be stored at -20°C or colder.
7. PROCEDURE
7.1 Sample Preparation:
• Thaw frozen samples at room temperature or in the refrigerator
(2-8°C).
• Mix samples thoroughly by vortexing.
7.2 Assay Procedure:
• Refer to the specific instructions provided in the Anisakis-specific
IgE ELISA Kit insert.
Step-by-Step Procedure:
1. Preparation:
◦ Bring all reagents and samples to room temperature
(20-25°C) before use.
◦ Prepare washing buffer and other reagents as instructed by
the kit insert.
2. Plate Setup:
◦ Allocate wells for standards, controls, and patient samples.
◦ Add specific volumes of appropriate calibrators to the
designated wells.
◦ Add patient serum samples to the remaining wells.
3. Incubation:
◦ Add the specific IgE-enzyme conjugate to each well.
◦ Cover the microplate and incubate for the time specified in
the kit insert at 37°C.
4. Washing:
◦ Wash the wells multiple times with washing buffer to remove
unbound substances.
5. Substrate Reaction:
◦ Add the substrate solution to each well and incubate for the
specified time at room temperature or as instructed.
6. Stopping Reaction:
◦ Add stop solution to each well to halt the reaction.
7. Reading the Plate:
◦ Measure the optical density (OD) at the wavelength
specified in the kit insert using an ELISA reader.
8. QUALITY CONTROL:
• Run controls with known levels of IgE alongside patient samples.
• Ensure that QC values fall within the established acceptable
ranges.
• If QC values are outside acceptable limits, do not proceed with
result reporting until troubleshooting and corrective actions are
performed.
9. RESULT INTERPRETATION:
• Construct a standard curve by plotting OD values against the
concentration of calibrators.
• Use the standard curve to calculate the IgE levels in patient
samples.
• Validate the results using the criteria specified in the kit insert.
10. REPORTING RESULTS:
• Enter the validated results into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
• Results must be reviewed and verified by senior lab technologists
before release.
11. LIMITATIONS:
• Refer to the specific limitations mentioned in the kit insert.
• Factors such as hemolysis, lipemia, and improper storage may
affect the assay performance.
12. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS:
• Follow standard laboratory safety protocols.
• Dispose of biohazard waste properly.
• Handle all samples as potentially infectious.
13. RECORD-KEEPING:
• Document all steps in the assay including sample identification,
QC results, and any deviations or issues encountered.
• Maintain records for traceability and regulatory compliance.
14. REFERENCES:
• Anisakis-specific IgE ELISA Kit insert.

This concludes the SOP for the analytical phase of generating results
for ANISAKIS, PARASITE, IGE, SERUM.
