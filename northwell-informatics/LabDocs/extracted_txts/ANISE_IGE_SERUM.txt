SOP for ANISE, IGE, SERUM Analysis
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the analysis of ANISE, IGE,
SERUM in serum samples using an automated immunoassay
analyzer. This protocol ensures the accuracy, precision, and reliability
of test results while maintaining compliance with CLIA standards.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
Laboratory personnel trained on the specific immunoassay analyzer
for ANISE, IGE, SERUM analysis are responsible for performing the
procedure.
1. DEFINITIONS
ANISE: Antigen-Specific Immunoglobulin E IGE: Immunoglobulin E
SERUM: The fluid component of blood used for diagnostic testing.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Automated immunoassay analyzer (e.g., Tecan, Immulite, or other
CLIA-certified instrument)
• ANISE, IGE, SERUM reagent kits
• Calibrators and controls
• Quality control materials (low, medium, and high)
• Micropipettes and pipette tips
• Laboratory-grade deionized water
• Serum separator tubes (SST)
1. SPECIMENS
Preferred Specimen: Serum from SST, separated from the clot within
2 hours of collection, and stored at 2-8°C if not analyzed within 24
hours. Serum can be frozen at -20°C for long-term storage.
1. PROCEDURE
6.1 Specimen Preparation
• Allow refrigerated serum samples to reach room temperature
before analysis.
• Mix samples gently by inverting the tube 5-10 times. Avoid
vigorous shaking.
6.2 Calibration
• Run calibrators following the manufacturer’s instructions and
analyzer’s standard operating procedure.
• Verify calibration curves meet acceptable criteria before
proceeding with sample analysis.
6.3 Quality Control
• Test three levels of quality control (QC) material (low, medium,
high) at the beginning of each run.
• Ensure that QC results are within acceptable limits before
reporting patient results.
• Document all QC results in the QC log.
6.4 Sample Analysis
• Load reagent kits and prepare the analyzer according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
• Program the analyzer with the appropriate test parameters for
ANISE, IGE, SERUM analysis.
• Load patient serum samples into the analyzer.
• Start the analysis run.
6.5 Result Verification
• Review results to ensure they are within the analyzer’s reportable
range.
• Repeat analysis for any sample displaying out-of-range or flagged
results.
• Document any repeat testing and troubleshooting performed.
• Verify results against established reference ranges.
6.6 Reporting and Documentation
• Enter verified results into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
• Review and approve results for release to patient records.
• Ensure all analysis information, including calibrators, QC results,
and patient results, are documented accurately.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If QC results are out of range, investigate potential causes (e.g.,
expired reagents, instrument malfunction) and take corrective
actions before proceeding.
• For calibration failures, rerun calibrations or contact the technical
support for guidance.
• For flagged patient results, review sample integrity (hemolysis,
lipemia) and consider re-preparing or recollecting the sample if
necessary.
1. MAINTENANCE AND CALIBRATION
• Follow routine maintenance schedules as recommended by the
instrument manufacturer.
• Perform daily, weekly, and monthly maintenance checks and
document in the maintenance log.
• Schedule regular calibration verification using certified calibrators.

Note: Ensure that all personnel involved are trained on this SOP and
any updates that may occur. This protocol aims to ensure the highest
level of accuracy and reliability in ANISE, IGE, SERUM test results,
adhering to all relevant regulatory guidelines and standards.
