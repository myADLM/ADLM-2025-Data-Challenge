Standard Operating Procedure for ANNATTO SEED (BIXA
ORELLANA) IGE Assay
1. PURPOSE To provide standardized procedures for the accurate
and reliable measurement of specific IgE antibodies to Annatto
Seed (Bixa orellana) in human serum or plasma.
2. RESPONSIBILITY All designated laboratory staff members who
perform the analytical phase of testing are responsible for
adhering to this protocol. Supervisors are responsible for
ensuring compliance and addressing any issues related to the
procedure.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS Preferred Specimen: • Serum or
plasma (collected in either EDTA, heparin, or citrate tubes). •
Minimum volume: 1 mL.
Unacceptable Specimens: • Grossly hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric
samples. • Specimens collected in outdated or unvalidated collection
tubes. • Samples arriving at the laboratory more than 48 hours after
collection without refrigeration.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS • Immunoassay analyzer (e.g.,
Phadia 250, IMMULITE 2000) • Annatto Seed (Bixa orellana)
IgE reagent kit • Calibrators and controls specific to the assay •
Micropipettes and tips • Vortex mixer • Centrifuge • Plate reader
(if applicable)
2. QUALITY CONTROL • Use positive and negative controls with
each run to ensure assay performance. • Record and monitor
control results to ensure they fall within established ranges. •
Inspect reagents for signs of contamination or degradation. •
Perform a calibration check daily or as indicated by the
manufacturer's guidelines.
3. PROCEDURE A. Sample Preparation:
1. Centrifuge the serum or plasma specimen at 1500 x g for
10 minutes.
2. Transfer the supernatant to a clean tube, avoiding any
cellular debris.
3. If not tested immediately, store aliquots at 2-8°C for up to
72 hours or freeze at -20°C or lower for longer-term
storage.
B. Assay Procedure:
1. Allow all reagents and specimens to reach room
temperature before use.
2. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for the preparation
of the immunoassay.
3. Dilute the calibrators, controls, and samples as specified
by the manufacturer’s protocol.
4. Load the specimens, calibrators, and controls into the
designated wells or sample positions of the immunoassay
analyzer.
5. Initiate the automated program for the specific IgE assay
for Annatto Seed (Bixa orellana).
6. The analyzer will automatically process the samples,
including incubation, washing, and detection steps.
C. Result Generation:
1. Upon completion of the analytical process, results will be
automatically calculated and displayed by the analyzer.
2. Review the quality control results to ensure they are
within acceptable ranges before accepting patient results.
3. Any patient result that falls outside the standard operating
range or that fails quality control parameters should be
rerun.
4. VALIDATION AND REPORTING: • Review the assay data for
each run, including controls and patient results. • Validate the
results using the laboratory’s validation criteria. • Enter
validated results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS). •
If results are flagged as critical, notify the appropriate clinical
personnel immediately, following the laboratory’s critical value
notification policy.
5. TROUBLESHOOTING: • If the control values fall outside of the
acceptable range, investigate the cause:
◦ Re-run the controls
◦ Check for reagent expiration or contamination
◦ Inspect the equipment for malfunctions or maintenance
needs • Document any troubleshooting steps taken and the
resolution.
6. LIMITATIONS: • Immunoassay results should always be
interpreted in conjunction with the patient's clinical history and
other diagnostic findings. • Potential cross-reactivity with other
substances may affect the specificity of the assay. • Hemolyzed,
lipemic, or icteric samples may interfere with the assay’s
performance.
7. REFERENCES: • Manufacturer’s package insert for the Annatto
Seed (Bixa orellana) IgE reagent kit. • Clinical and Laboratory
Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines for immunoassay
procedures.
By following this SOP, the laboratory ensures the production of
accurate and reliable results for the measurement of Annatto Seed
(Bixa orellana) IgE, thereby supporting clinical diagnosis and patient
care.
