STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP) FOR ANNEXIN-1
IMMUNOSTAIN – TECHNICAL COMPONENT ONLY
1. PURPOSE: To outline the procedure for performing Annexin-1
immunostaining on tissue sections to ensure accurate and
reproducible results.
2. SCOPE: This procedure applies to laboratory personnel in the
Histology Department responsible for performing Annexin-1
immunohistochemistry staining.
3. RESPONSIBILITY: Laboratory technologists are responsible for
performing the immunostain procedure as outlined. The laboratory
supervisor is responsible for ensuring that staff are trained and
competent in this procedure and for maintaining the necessary
records.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS:
• Specimen Type: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue
sections.
• Section Thickness: 4-5 micrometers.
• Handling: Ensure tissue sections are properly dried and
appropriately labeled. Store at room temperature until use.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND MATERIALS:
• Microtome
• Water bath
• Adhesive-coated slides
• Drying oven
• Xylene (or xylene substitute)
• Ethanol (100%, 95%, and 70%)
• Distilled water
• Antigen retrieval buffer (e.g., citrate buffer pH 6.0 or EDTA buffer
pH 9.0)
• Water bath/Pressure cooker/Steamer for antigen retrieval
• Annexin-1 primary antibody
• Secondary antibody (HRP-conjugated)
• DAB (3,3'-Diaminobenzidine) substrate
• Hematoxylin
• Mounting medium
• Coverslips
• Moist chamber
6. PROCEDURE: A. Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
1. Heat slides in drying oven at 60°C for 1 hour.
2. Deparaffinize sections in 3 changes of xylene (or substitute) for
5 minutes each.
3. Rehydrate slides through graded ethanol series (100%, 95%,
70%) for 5 minutes each.
4. Rinse slides in distilled water.
B. Antigen Retrieval:
1. Prepare antigen retrieval buffer (e.g., citrate buffer pH 6.0).
2. Place slides in retrieval buffer and heat at 95-98°C using a
water bath, pressure cooker, or steamer for 20 minutes.
3. Allow slides to cool in buffer for 20 minutes at room
temperature.
4. Rinse slides in distilled water.
C. Blocking Endogenous Peroxidase:
1. Incubate slides in 3% hydrogen peroxide in methanol for 10
minutes to block endogenous peroxidase activity.
2. Rinse slides in distilled water.
D. Primary Antibody Incubation:
1. Dilute Annexin-1 primary antibody according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Apply the diluted primary antibody to the tissue sections.
3. Incubate slides in a moist chamber for 1 hour at room
temperature.
4. Rinse slides in PBS or TBS buffer for 5 minutes, 3 times.
E. Secondary Antibody Incubation:
1. Apply HRP-conjugated secondary antibody to the tissue
sections.
2. Incubate slides in a moist chamber for 30 minutes at room
temperature.
3. Rinse slides in PBS or TBS buffer for 5 minutes, 3 times.
F. Detection:
1. Prepare DAB substrate solution according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Apply DAB substrate to tissue sections and monitor staining
under a microscope.
3. When desired staining is achieved, immediately rinse slides in
distilled water.
G. Counterstaining and Mounting:
1. Counterstain slides with hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes.
2. Rinse slides in running tap water for 5 minutes.
3. Dehydrate slides through graded ethanol series (70%, 95%,
100%) for 2 minutes each.
4. Clear slides in 3 changes of xylene (or substitute) for 5 minutes
each.
5. Mount coverslips using an appropriate mounting medium.
7. QUALITY CONTROL:
• Include positive and negative controls in each run to ensure
staining specificity and technique.
• Document all steps, reagent lot numbers, and any deviations from
the protocol.
8. REPORTING RESULTS:
• The stained slides will be forwarded to the pathologist for
evaluation and interpretation.
• Document results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS) as
per the site-specific guidelines.
9. LIMITATIONS:
• Ensure proper antigen retrieval based on tissue type and antibody
requirements.
• Variations in fixation, tissue processing, and staining can affect
staining quality.
10. REFERENCES:
• Manufacturer’s instructions for all reagents and antibodies.
• Laboratory quality management guidelines.
11. DOCUMENT REVIEW: This SOP will be reviewed annually or
whenever significant changes are made to the methodology or
reagents.
