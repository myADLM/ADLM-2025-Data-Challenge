Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Anti-Bestrophin Autoantibodies
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized protocol for the detection and
quantification of anti-bestrophin autoantibodies in patient serum
samples. This procedure ensures accurate and reproducible results
necessary for diagnostic purposes.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for carrying out this
procedure accurately and effectively. Supervisors are responsible for
overseeing the process and ensuring compliance with this SOP.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred Specimen:
◦ 5 mL of serum collected in a serum separator tube (SST).
◦ Allow the blood to clot for 30 minutes at room temperature and
then centrifuge for 10 minutes at 1500xg to separate the
serum.
• Unacceptable Specimen:
◦ Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
◦ Samples that have been stored at room temperature for more
than 24 hours or refrigerated for more than 72 hours before
analysis.
3. EQUIPMENT & REAGENTS
• ELISA Reader and Washer
• Incubator (37°C)
• Pipettes and Tips (10 µL, 200 µL, 1000 µL)
• Microcentrifuge Tubes
• Standard Controls (Positive and Negative Controls)
• Anti-Bestrophin Autoantibodies ELISA Kit containing:
◦ Coated Microtiter Plates
◦ Standards
◦ Detection Antibodies
◦ Substrate Solution
◦ Stop Solution
◦ Wash Buffer
◦ Dilution Buffer
4. PROCEDURE
A. PRE-ANALYSIS
1. Preparation:
◦ Allow all reagents, samples, and controls to reach room
temperature (20-25°C) before use.
◦ Set up the microplate according to the number of samples
and controls to be tested.
2. Calibration:
◦ Perform a calibration using the ELISA standards provided in
the kit. Prepare a standard curve by serially diluting the
highest standard according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
B. ANALYTICAL PHASE
1. Sample Preparation:
◦ Dilute patient serum samples 1:100 with the provided
dilution buffer.
2. Assay Procedure:
◦ Add 100 µL of diluted samples, standards, and controls to
the appropriate wells of the microtiter plate.
◦ Incubate the plate for 1 hour at 37°C.
◦ Aspirate and wash the wells 5 times with wash buffer,
ensuring that each well is filled completely.
◦ Add 100 µL of the detection antibody to each well.
◦ Incubate the plate for 1 hour at 37°C.
◦ Aspirate and wash the wells 5 times with wash buffer.
◦ Add 100 µL of substrate solution to each well.
◦ Incubate the plate in the dark for 15-30 minutes at room
temperature.
◦ Add 100 µL of stop solution to each well to stop the reaction.
3. Reading the Plate:
◦ Read the optical density (OD) of each well at 450 nm using
an ELISA reader within 5 minutes of adding the stop
solution.
C. POST-ANALYSIS
1. Data Analysis:
◦ Calculate the concentration of anti-bestrophin
autoantibodies in the patient samples using the standard
curve.
◦ Ensure all controls fall within the acceptable ranges before
interpreting sample results.
2. Quality Control:
◦ Include positive and negative controls in each run of
samples.
◦ Repeat the test if the controls are outside the acceptable
range.
3. Reporting Results:
◦ Document the results in the laboratory information system
(LIS).
◦ Report results according to site-specific reporting guidelines.
Critical values should be communicated to the healthcare
provider immediately.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
• Conduct routine performance checks on the ELISA reader and
washer to maintain accuracy.
• Perform regular maintenance and calibration of equipment as per
manufacturer instructions.
• Use internal quality controls for every batch of tests to ensure
assay reliability.
6. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Ensure the sample is free from hemolysis, lipemia, and icterus to
avoid interference in the assay.
• Follow manufacturer instructions for kit use to avoid cross-
reactivity and false positives.
