Standard Operating Procedure for Anti-C1q Antibodies, IgG,
Serum Analysis
1. PURPOSE To establish a standardized procedure for the
analysis of Anti-C1q Antibodies, IgG in serum specimens to
ensure accurate and reliable test results.
2. SCOPE This procedure applies to all personnel performing Anti-
C1q Antibodies, IgG analysis in the laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY It is the responsibility of laboratory staff to
perform the Anti-C1q Antibodies, IgG analysis following this
SOP. Supervisors are responsible for ensuring compliance and
for providing training to new personnel.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
◦ Preferred Specimen: 5 mL of serum collected in a red or
gold top tube.
◦ Acceptable Specimen: Serum separated from a clot within
2 hours of collection.
◦ Unacceptable Specimens: Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric
specimens should be rejected.
5. REAGENTS AND MATERIALS
◦ Anti-C1q IgG ELISA kit
◦ Pipettes and pipette tips
◦ Microplate washer
◦ Microplate reader with 450 nm filter
◦ Calibrators and controls
◦ Wash buffer, sample diluent, conjugate, substrate, and stop
solution as provided in the ELISA kit
6. EQUIPMENT
◦ Centrifuge
◦ Refrigerator (2-8°C)
◦ Freezer (-20°C)
◦ Timer
◦ Vortex mixer
◦ Incubator set at the required temperature according to the
kit insert
7. PROCEDURE A. Preparation:
◦ Bring all reagents to room temperature before use.
◦ Prepare wash buffer and other reagents as per the
manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Label microplate and prepare layout for standards, controls,
and patient samples.
B. Specimen Handling:
◦ Ensure serum samples are adequately centrifuged to
separate serum from clot.
◦ Store separated serum samples at 2-8°C if analysis is to be
performed within 48 hours; otherwise, store at -20°C.
C. Assay Procedure:
1. Sample Dilution:
▪ Dilute serum samples 1:100 with sample diluent (or as
specified by kit instructions).
2. Loading the Microplate:
▪ Add 100 µL of standards, controls, and diluted
samples to the appropriate wells.
3. Incubation:
▪ Incubate the plate for the specified time at the required
temperature.
4. Washing:
▪ Wash the wells thoroughly using the microplate
washer, as instructed by the kit manufacturer.
5. Conjugate Addition:
▪ Add conjugate to each well and incubate.
6. Substrate Addition:
▪ Add substrate to each well, incubate, then add stop
solution to terminate the reaction.
7. Reading the Plate:
▪ Read the absorbance at 450 nm using the microplate
reader.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Run positive and negative controls with each batch of tests.
◦ Ensure results of controls are within established ranges
before reporting patient results.
◦ Perform periodic calibration of the microplate reader per
manufacturer guidelines.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ Calculate the concentration of Anti-C1q IgG antibodies using
the standard curve.
◦ Report results in units as specified by the assay kit
instructions.
◦ Reference range: Use manufacturer’s recommended cut-off
values, or in-house established ranges if validated.
10. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
• Negative: Below the lower limit of the cut-off range.
• Positive: Above the upper limit of the cut-off range.
• Borderline: Values within the cut-off range.
1. LIMITATIONS
• Hemolyzed or lipemic samples may lead to inaccurate results.
• Refer to the kit insert for specific limitations related to interference
or cross-reactivity.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If controls fall outside acceptable limits, do not report patient
results. Investigate potential sources of error including equipment
malfunction or reagent issues.
• Repeat assay with fresh reagents or recalibrate equipment as
needed.
