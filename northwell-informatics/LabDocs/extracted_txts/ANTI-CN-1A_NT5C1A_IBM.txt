Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase Protocol for Detection of Anti-CN-1A (NT5C1A)
Autoantibodies in Inclusion Body Myositis (IBM)
1. PURPOSE:
The purpose of this procedure is to provide laboratory personnel with
detailed instructions for the analytical phase of detecting Anti-CN-1A
(NT5C1A) autoantibodies in patients suspected of having Inclusion
Body Myositis (IBM).
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory personnel to
perform the tests as per this SOP, record the results accurately, and
ensure compliance with quality control measures.
1. SPECIMEN:
◦ Specimen Type: Serum.
◦ Volume: Minimum of 1 mL.
◦ Stability: Serum specimens should be stored at 2-8°C for
up to 7 days; for long-term storage, specimens should be
frozen at -20°C or lower.
◦ Unacceptable Specimens: Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric
specimens.
2. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS:
◦ Anti-CN-1A (NT5C1A) ELISA or similar immunoassay kits.
◦ Calibrated microplate reader set to the appropriate
wavelength (usually 450 nm).
◦ Incubator set at 37°C.
◦ Precision pipettes and tips.
◦ Microcentrifuge and tubes.
◦ Wash buffer, substrate solution, and stop solution (as per kit
instructions).
◦ Quality control sera: positive and negative controls.
3. PROCEDURE:
4.1 Preparation: - Prepare all reagents, controls, and patient
samples as instructed in the ELISA kit insert. - Bring all
reagents to room temperature before use.
4.2 Assay Procedure: 1. Sample Dilution: - Dilute patient
serum samples 1:100 in the provided sample buffer. 2. Plate
Preparation: - Pipette 100 µL of diluted patient samples,
controls, and standards into the respective wells of the
microtiter plate. 3. Incubation: - Incubate the plate for 30-60
minutes at 37°C. 4. Washing: - Wash the plate 3-5 times with
wash buffer to remove unbound materials. 5. Secondary
Antibody Addition: - Add 100 µL of enzyme-conjugated
secondary antibody to each well. 6. Secondary Incubation: -
Incubate the plate again for 30 minutes at 37°C. 7. Second
Washing: - Wash the plate 3-5 times with wash buffer to
remove unbound secondary antibody. 8. Substrate Reaction: -
Add 100 µL of substrate solution to each well and incubate in
the dark for 10-30 minutes at room temperature. 9. Reaction
Termination: - Add 100 µL of stop solution to each well to
terminate the reaction. 10. Measurement: - Measure the
absorbance at 450 nm using a microplate reader within 30
minutes.
4.3 Quality Control: - Run positive and negative controls with
each batch of patient samples. - The assay is valid only if the
controls fall within the expected ranges.
4. RESULT INTERPRETATION:
◦ Positive: Absorbance values exceed the established cutoff
value (determined based on control data and provided
standards).
◦ Negative: Absorbance values are below the cutoff value.
◦ Indeterminate or Borderline: Results near the cutoff value
may require repeat testing or confirmation with another
method.
5. REPORTING RESULTS:
◦ Record sample identification, absorbance values, control
results, and final interpretation (positive/negative/
indeterminate) in the laboratory information system (LIS).
◦ Issue the final report to the requesting physician as per
standard reporting guidelines.
6. QUALITY CONTROL AND TROUBLESHOOTING:
◦ If quality control results fall outside the expected ranges,
identify and rectify potential issues such as pipetting errors,
reagent contamination, or equipment malfunction.
◦ Document all corrective actions taken in the laboratory QC
log.
7. REFERENCE INTERVALS:
◦ Negative: Below defined cutoff value.
◦ Positive: Above defined cutoff value.
8. LIMITATIONS:
◦ Ensure that hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric specimens are not
used, as they may interfere with the assay.
◦ Cross-reactivity with other antibodies should be noted and, if
necessary, additional confirmatory tests should be
considered.
