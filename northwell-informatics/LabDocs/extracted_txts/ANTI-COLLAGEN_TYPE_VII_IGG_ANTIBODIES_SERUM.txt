Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Anti-Collagen Type VII, IgG Antibodies, Serum Assay
1. PURPOSE
To standardize the procedure for the detection of anti-collagen type
VII IgG antibodies in serum specimens using Enzyme-Linked
Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). This test helps in the diagnosis and
monitoring of autoimmune bullous diseases, such as Epidermolysis
Bullosa Acquisita (EBA).
2. RESPONSIBILITY
Qualified laboratory personnel are responsible for:
• Performing the ELISA test for Anti-Collagen Type VII IgG
antibodies.
• Ensuring accurate practice and documentation as specified in this
SOP.
• Reporting any equipment malfunctions, reagent issues, or any
other problem to a supervisor.
3. DEFINITIONS
Anti-Collagen Type VII, IgG Antibodies: Autoantibodies directed
against collagen type VII.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
• Preferred/acceptable: Serum, collected in a serum separator tube
(SST), centrifuged within 2 hours of collection.
• Stability: Serum is stable at 2-8°C for up to 7 days. For long-term
storage, serum should be frozen at -20°C or lower.
5. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• ELISA reader (with 450 nm wavelength)
• Incubator (37°C)
• Reagent kit for Anti-Collagen Type VII IgG Antibodies (store as
per manufacturer’s instructions)
• Microplate washer
• Pipettes and tips (various volumes)
• Deionized or distilled water
• Laboratory timer
• Calibrators, Controls (Negative and Positive)
6. PROCEDURE
Assay Preparation:
1. Verify that all reagents and equipment are functional and within
their expiration dates.
2. Bring all reagents and samples to room temperature (18-25°C)
before use.
3. Prepare the work area with all necessary equipment and
supplies.
Sample Preparation:
1. Thaw frozen samples at room temperature.
2. Mix thoroughly using a vortex mixer, ensuring no bubbles.
3. Dilute serum samples, calibrators, and controls as per kit
instructions.
Assay Procedure:
1. Coating:
◦ Add 100 µL of sample, calibrator, and control to each well of
the microtiter plate. Include blank wells (containing only
substrate) as required.
◦ Incubate for 30 minutes at room temperature (RT).
2. Washing:
◦ Wash the microwell strips 3-5 times with wash buffer using
the microplate washer.
3. Enzyme Conjugate Addition:
◦ Add 100 µL of enzyme conjugate (peroxidase-conjugated
anti-human IgG) to each well.
◦ Incubate for 30 minutes at RT.
4. Washing:
◦ Wash the microwell strips 3-5 times with wash buffer.
5. Substrate Addition:
◦ Add 100 µL of TMB substrate solution to each well.
◦ Incubate for 15 minutes at RT in the dark.
6. Stopping Reaction:
◦ Add 100 µL of stop solution to each well. The solution
should change from blue to yellow.
7. Reading:
◦ Read the optical density (OD) at 450 nm within 30 minutes
of adding the stop solution using the ELISA reader.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
Perform quality control checks with each assay setup:
1. Run positive and negative controls in each assay.
2. Results from controls must fall within the specified range before
patient results are accepted.
Internal Quality Control:
• Perform QC on each new lot of reagents.
• Document any deviations and report to the supervisor.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Calculate the antibody concentration of each sample based on
the standard curve generated from the calibrators.
• Report results in specified units (e.g., U/mL), following the site-
specific reporting guidelines.
• Flag results that fall below or exceed the established reference
intervals.
9. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Negative: <10 U/mL
• Equivocal: 10-20 U/mL
• Positive: >20 U/mL
10. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolyzed samples may interfere with results.
• Rheumatoid factor and other autoantibodies may cause non-
specific binding.
• Refer to the kit insert for limitations specific to the reagents used.
