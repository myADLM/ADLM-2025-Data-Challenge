Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Protocol for ANTI-DNASE B TITER, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
To ensure the accurate and efficient processing, analysis, and
reporting of Anti-DNase B Titer in serum specimens in accordance
with laboratory standards.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel conducting the
Anti-DNase B Titer assay within the clinical laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of laboratory personnel to adhere to this SOP
and perform the analysis in compliance with established guidelines
and safety protocols. Supervisors are responsible for ensuring staff
proficiency in this procedure.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Serum
• Collection Container: Red-top tube or serum separator tube (SST)
• Volume: Minimum of 0.5 mL serum required.
• Storage: Serum specimens should be refrigerated at 2-8°C and
are stable for up to 7 days. For longer storage, freeze at -20°C or
lower.
5. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Anti-DNase B reagent kit (include manufacturer details and lot
number)
• Calibrators and quality control material (low, medium, high)
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Microplate reader capable of measuring absorbance at 405 nm
• Incubator set at 37°C
• Vortex mixer
• Laboratory timer
• Deionized water
6. PROCEDURE
6.1 Preparation
1. Reagent Preparation:
◦ Prepare all reagents according to the manufacturer's
instructions provided with the Anti-DNase B reagent kit.
2. Calibrator and Control Preparation:
◦ Prepare calibrators and controls as per manufacturer’s
instructions. Ensure they cover the expected range of
sample concentrations.
3. Equipment and Instrument Setting:
◦ Set the microplate reader to 405 nm.
◦ Pre-warm the incubator to 37°C.
6.2 Sample Handling
1. Allow serum specimens, calibrators, and controls to reach room
temperature before analysis.
2. Mix specimens gently using a vortex mixer prior to analysis to
ensure homogeneity.
6.3 Assay Procedure
1. Microplate Setup:
◦ Assign wells for calibrators, quality control samples, and
patient serum samples on a 96-well microplate.
2. Pipetting Samples:
◦ Add the appropriate volume of specimen, calibrator, or
control into assigned wells (typically 100 µL per well, refer to
kit protocol).
3. DNase Reagent Addition:
◦ Add DNase B reagent to each well according to the
manufacturer’s instructions (e.g., 100 µL per well).
4. Incubation:
◦ Incubate the microplate at 37°C for 60 minutes in the
incubator.
5. Reaction Stopping:
◦ After incubation, stop the reaction as per the manufacturer’s
instructions (e.g., add 100 µL of stop solution to each well).
6.4 Measurement
1. Plate Readout:
◦ Measure the absorbance of each well at 405 nm using the
microplate reader.
6.5 Calculation of Results
1. Standard Curve:
◦ Plot the calibration curve using the absorbance values of the
calibrators and their corresponding concentrations.
2. Sample Concentration:
◦ Determine the concentration of Anti-DNase B in the patient
samples by interpolating their absorbance values on the
calibration curve.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Run quality control samples (low, medium, high) with each
batch of patient samples.
2. Document QC results and ensure they fall within the
established acceptance range. If QC results are outside of the
acceptable range, troubleshooting steps must be taken before
proceeding with patient samples.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Review and verify all results by comparing sample data against
QC and calibrator results.
2. Enter verified results into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
3. Report results in IU/mL (International Units per milliliter).
9. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
• Reference Range: <240 IU/mL (may vary depending on the
population and method used; verify specific reference ranges).
• High levels of Anti-DNase B Titer may indicate a recent or past
infection with Group A Streptococcus.
10. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolytic, lipemic, or icteric samples may interfere with the
accuracy of the assay.
• Proper handling and storage of specimens are crucial to prevent
degradation of Anti-DNase B.

troubleshooting.
• Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines.
12. DOCUMENTATION
• Maintain records of each assay run, including lot numbers of
reagents, calibrators, and control values.
• Document any deviations from the protocol and corrective actions
taken.

Anti-DNase B Titer analysis, contributing to accurate diagnostic
outcomes.
