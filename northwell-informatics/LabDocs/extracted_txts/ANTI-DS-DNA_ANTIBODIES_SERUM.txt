Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase of Generating Results for Anti-DS-DNA
Antibodies, Serum
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the procedure for the processing and analysis of
serum samples for the detection and quantification of anti-double-
stranded DNA (anti-DS-DNA) antibodies. This test is an essential
assay primarily used for the diagnosis and monitoring of systemic
lupus erythematosus (SLE).
2. SCOPE
This procedure ensures the accurate and consistent determination of
anti-DS-DNA antibody levels in serum samples. It applies to all
clinical laboratory technologists and technicians performing the assay
under specific guidelines to maintain quality and reliability of results.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all laboratory personnel to perform the
procedures accurately and in compliance with this SOP. Supervisors
are responsible for ensuring adherence to this procedure and for
addressing any issues encountered during the process.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type: Serum
Volume: A minimum of 1 mL of serum is required for the assay.
Collection and Handling: Collect blood in a red-top (serum) tube or
serum separator tube (SST). Allow the blood to clot at room
temperature for 30 minutes and then centrifugate to separate the
serum. Transfer the serum into a secondary labeled tube.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
• Specimens collected in tubes other than specified.
• Insufficient serum volume.
Storage and Stability:
• Serum samples are stable at 2-8°C for up to 72 hours.
• For long-term storage, freeze the serum at -20°C or lower.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Automated immunoassay analyzer (e.g., ELISA reader,
Chemiluminescent Immunoassay Analyzer)
• Microcentrifuge
• Adjustable pipettes and sterile pipette tips
• Vortex mixer
• Incubators (37°C and 2-8°C)
Reagents and Supplies:
• Anti-DS-DNA antibody test kits (compatible with the specific
analyzer model)
• Quality control sera (low, medium, high)
• Calibrators
• ProClin 300 (Preservative if required)
• Laboratory-grade deionized or distilled water
• Sample vials and caps
6. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation and Setup:
1. Reagent Preparation:
◦ Reconstitute reagents and controls according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Allow reagents to reach room
temperature.
◦ Verify the expiration dates and lot numbers of all reagents
and controls.
2. Instrument Calibration:
◦ Ensure the analyzer is calibrated using the provided
calibrators for the test kit being used.
◦ Perform calibration verification according to the
manufacturer's specifications.
◦ Document calibration results in the instrument maintenance
log.
3. Quality Control:
◦ Run quality control samples (low, medium, high) before
analyzing patient samples.
◦ Verify that QC results are within acceptable ranges.
◦ Document QC results. If QC is out of range, troubleshoot
before proceeding with patient samples.
B. Sample Analysis:
1. Sample Preparation:
◦ Thaw frozen samples at room temperature and mix by
gentle inversion or vortexing.
◦ Centrifuge samples if particulate matter is present.
2. Loading Samples:
◦ Load patient samples, controls, and calibrators into the
designated racks or slots in the analyzer.
◦ Ensure that sample identification numbers are accurately
entered into the analyzer's software or manually logged.
3. Running the Assay:
◦ Initiate the assay run according to the analyzer’s operating
instructions.
◦ Monitor the assay run to ensure there are no errors or
deviations.
◦ Upon completion, review the preliminary results on the
analyzer’s display screen.
C. Post-Run Procedures:
1. Verifying Results:
◦ Assess the data for each sample to ensure there are no
flags or errors.
◦ Validate the quality control results to confirm assay integrity.
2. Interpretation of Results:
◦ Compare patient results to the reference ranges provided in
the kit insert.
◦ Positive results indicate the presence of anti-DS-DNA
antibodies and may be indicative of SLE or other
autoimmune disorders.
◦ Record results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
3. Reporting Results:
◦ Print the finalized report for each patient sample.
◦ Ensure that results are reviewed by a designated laboratory
professional.
◦ Annotate any discrepancies or required follow-up actions.
7. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the respective assay kit insert for detailed information on
limitations and potential interferences. Factors such as hemolysis,
lipemia, improper storage, and incorrect sample handling can affect
the accuracy of the results.
8. DOCUMENTATION
• Ensure that all steps, including calibrations, quality control, and
patient test results, are thoroughly documented in the appropriate
logs.
• Maintain a record of any deviations, troubleshooting actions, and
resolutions in the deviation log.
