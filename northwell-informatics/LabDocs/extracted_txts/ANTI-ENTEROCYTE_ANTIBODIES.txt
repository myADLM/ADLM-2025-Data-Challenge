Standard Operating Procedure for Anti-Enterocyte
Antibodies Analysis
1. PURPOSE
To provide clear instructions for the analysis phase of testing for anti-
enterocyte antibodies in the laboratory. This SOP ensures
consistency, reliability, and accuracy of test results.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the
analytical procedures as outlined in this SOP, ensuring all steps are
accurately followed and documented. Supervisors are responsible for
overseeing the adherence to these protocols and intervening when
necessary.
2. DEFINITIONS
Anti-enterocyte antibodies: Autoantibodies targeting the cells lining
the intestines. These are indicative of certain gastrointestinal
disorders.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen Type:
Preferred: Serum samples collected in SST (Serum Separation Tube)
Acceptable: Plasma samples collected in EDTA or heparinized tubes
Volume: Minimum 2 mL
Stability:
Room Temperature: 24 hours Refrigerator (2-8°C): 7 days Freezer
(-20°C): 1 month
Unacceptable Specimen Conditions:
Specimens that are hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric beyond acceptable
levels Specimens with insufficient volume Specimens received in
non-approved collection tubes
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• ELISA Reader
• Automated Plate Washer
• Pipettes and tips
• Microplate kit for anti-enterocyte antibody testing
◦ Coated microplates
◦ Calibrators
◦ Controls (positive and negative)
◦ Reaction buffers
◦ Substrate solution
◦ Stop solution
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
• Laboratory timer
• Vortex mixer
• Refrigerators and freezers for sample and reagent storage
5. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
• Ensure all reagents are at room temperature before starting the
assay.
• Prepare all necessary controls and calibrators as indicated in the
kit insert.
• Set up the ELISA Reader according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
Sample Preparation:
• Allow serum or plasma samples to equilibrate to room
temperature.
• If samples were refrigerated or frozen, ensure they are completely
thawed and well-mixed.
• Perform any necessary sample dilutions as indicated in the kit
insert (typically 1:101).
Assay Steps:
1. Coating:
• Dispense 100 µL of diluted samples, calibrators, and controls into
appropriate wells of the microplate.
• Seal plate and incubate for 30 minutes at room temperature.
1. Washing:
• Wash the plate using the automated plate washer with the
designated washing buffer. Perform five wash cycles to effectively
remove unbound substances.
1. Incubation:
• Add 100 μL of enzyme-conjugate reagent to each well. Seal the
plate and incubate for 30 minutes at room temperature.
1. Secondary Washing:
• Wash the plate using the automated plate washer with the
designated washing buffer. Perform five wash cycles.
1. Substrate Addition:
• Add 100 μL of substrate solution to each well and incubate for 15
minutes at room temperature (avoid light exposure).
1. Stopping Reaction:
• Add 50 μL of stop solution to each well to halt the enzymatic
reaction.
Reading Results:
• Place the plate in the ELISA Reader and measure absorbance at
450 nm wavelength.
Calculation and Interpretation:
• Compare absorbance values of samples to the calibrators to
determine concentrations of anti-enterocyte antibodies.
• Validate results against control values.
• Refer to the kit insert for interpretation criteria.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
Quality control samples must be included in each run to validate the
assay.
Internal Quality Control:
• Positive Control: Should fall within the manufacturer's specified
range.
• Negative Control: Should fall within the manufacturer's specified
range.
External Quality Control:
• Participate in external proficiency testing programs to ensure
assay reliability.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
Transmission:
• Results are automatically transmitted to the Laboratory
Information System (LIS) following validation by the technologist.
• Results must be reviewed for any inconsistencies or issues before
the final sign-off.
Documentation:
• Record the results and maintain them in the LIS and physical
logbooks as required.
• Any deviations, troubleshooting, or corrective actions must be
documented.
Critical Results:
• Immediately inform the treating physician and document the
notification process if critical values are observed.
