Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase:
Generating Results for Anti-Glial/Neuronal Nuclear Antibody-
Type 1 (AGNA-1) Titer, Serum
1. PURPOSE
To outline the standardized procedure for the analytical phase
involved in determining the titer of Anti-Glial/Neuronal Nuclear
Antibody-Type 1 (AGNA-1) in serum samples. This protocol ensures
accuracy, reliability, and consistency of results.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of trained medical laboratory scientists to
perform the analysis according to this SOP. They must ensure all
steps are accurately followed and properly documented.
2. DEFINITION
AGNA-1: Anti-Glial/Neuronal Nuclear Antibody-Type 1 is an
autoantibody associated with certain neuropathies.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES

• Calibration Standards
• Positive and Negative Controls
• Wash Buffer
• Substrate Solution
• Stop Solution
• Sample Diluent
Supplies:
• Microtiter Plates
• Plate Seals

4. PROCEDURE
Sample Preparation:
• Ensure serum samples are correctly labeled and match patient
records.
• Allow serum samples, controls, and reagents to equilibrate to
room temperature.
• Vortex samples gently and centrifuge at 1500 x g for 10 minutes if
precipitates are present.
Test Procedure:
1. Plate Setup:
◦ Label the microtiter plate clearly, indicating samples,
standards, and controls.
◦ Pipette 100 µL of each serum sample, calibrator, and control
into the designated wells of the microtiter plate.
◦ Ensure the use of fresh pipette tips for each well to avoid
cross-contamination.
2. Incubation:
◦ Add 100 µL of sample diluent to each well and cover the
plate with a plate seal.
◦ Incubate the plate at 37°C for 60 minutes on an incubator.
3. Washing:
◦ After incubation, wash the wells using a wash buffer.
Aspirate each well, then fill with 300 µL wash buffer. Repeat
the wash cycle a total of 5 times.
◦ Ensure all liquid is removed after the final wash by inverting
the plate and blotting it on absorbent paper.
4. Detection:
◦ Add 100 µL of the detection antibody to each well. Cover
with a new plate seal.
◦ Incubate the plate at 37°C for 30 minutes.
◦ Wash the plate again as described in step 3.
5. Substrate Reaction:
◦ Add 100 µL of substrate solution to each well. Incubate the
plate at room temperature in the dark for 15 minutes.
6. Stop Reaction:
◦ Add 100 µL of stop solution to each well to halt the reaction.
Gently tap the plate to ensure thorough mixing.
Results Reading:
• Read the absorbance of each well at 450 nm using a microplate
reader within 30 minutes of stopping the reaction.
• Ensure the microplate reader is pre-calibrated as per
manufacturer guidelines.
5. CALCULATIONS AND RESULTS
• Construct a standard curve using the absorbance values of the
calibrators.
• Plot the standard curve and derive the equation to calculate the
AGNA-1 titer in each sample.
• Ensure all controls fall within designated ranges. If controls do not
meet criteria, invalidate the run and repeat the test.
6. QUALITY CONTROL AND TROUBLESHOOTING
• Perform quality control checks with each assay run using positive
and negative controls.
• Document all quality control results in the logbook.
• Troubleshoot any deviations in control results, such as repeating
tests, ensuring reagent integrity, and checking calibration of
equipment.
• If consistent issues occur, escalate to a supervisor for review.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
• Validate results through a second technologist review.
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Report critical results immediately to the relevant healthcare
provider as per laboratory policy.
