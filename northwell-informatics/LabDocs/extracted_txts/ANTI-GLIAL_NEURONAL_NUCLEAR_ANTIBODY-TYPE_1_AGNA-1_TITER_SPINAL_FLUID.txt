1. PURPOSE
To outline the standard operating procedures for the analytical phase
of generating results for Anti-Glial/Neuronal Nuclear Antibody-Type 1
(AGNA-1) Titer in spinal fluid.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of the designated medical laboratory scientists
to follow the outlined procedure, ensure accurate and timely testing,
validate results, and perform necessary documentation.
1. DEFINITION
AGNA-1: Anti-Glial/Neuronal Nuclear Antibodies, Type 1, are
autoantibodies directed against neuronal nuclei and are used for
diagnostic purposes in various immune-related neurological
diseases.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Type of Specimen: Spinal fluid (CSF)
• Volume Required: Minimum of 2.0 mL
• Specimen Handling: Store and transport at 2-8°C after collection
for up to 48 hours or freeze and transport on dry ice if testing will
be delayed beyond 48 hours.
1. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes and tips
• Automated Immunofluorescence Assay (IFA) platform or manual
IFA kit
• Microscope with fluorescence capabilities
• AGNA-1 standard diagnostic kit, which includes a positive and
negative control
• Incubator set to 37°C
• Reagent-grade water
• Appropriate PPE (gloves, lab coat, goggles)
1. REAGENTS
• AGNA-1 antibody detection substrate slides
• Anti-human IgG conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)
• Mounting medium
• Wash buffer
*Note: Follow manufacturer instructions for storage conditions and
preparation standards.
1. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation
1. Sample Preparation:
◦ Centrifuge the spinal fluid samples at 1,000-2,000 RPM for
10 minutes to remove cellular debris.
◦ Aliquot the supernatant into clean, labelled tubes.
B) Immunofluorescence Assay (IFA)
1. Slide Preparation:
◦ Apply a standardized amount of the patient's spinal fluid
supernatant onto the substrate area of the AGNA-1 slide.
◦ Include both a positive control and a negative control in the
assay.
2. Incubation:
◦ Incubate the slides in a humid chamber at 37°C for 30
minutes to allow antibodies to bind to the antigens on the
substrate.
3. Washing:
◦ Thoroughly wash the slides with wash buffer to remove any
unbound antibodies.
◦ Allow slides to air dry or gently blot with paper towels
without disturbing the sample area.
4. Conjugate Application:
◦ Apply the anti-human IgG-FITC conjugate to each well and
incubate in the humid chamber at 37°C for 30 minutes.
5. Second Wash:
◦ Repeat the wash steps to remove any unbound conjugate,
air dry as needed.
C) Microscopy
1. Mounting:
◦ Apply mounting medium to the slide and cover with a
coverslip.
2. Reading:
◦ Examine the slides using a fluorescence microscope at
appropriate magnification (typically 40x to 100x).
◦ Evaluate and grade the fluorescence intensity of each well
using the manufacturer's criteria for titer levels. Record
observed titers for patient samples alongside those for
controls.
D) Quality Control:
1. Controls:
◦ Ensure the positive control demonstrates the expected
fluorescence pattern and intensity.
◦ Evaluate the negative control to confirm the absence of non-
specific fluorescence.
◦ If controls do not meet criteria, repeat the entire test run.
2. RESULTS REPORTING
• Compare the patient's fluorescence intensity with the control’s
fluorescence intensity to determine the AGNA-1 titer.
• Record titer values in the laboratory information system (LIS).
• Provide results to the referring physician, including intervals and
interpretative guidelines based on standardized reference ranges.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Negative: No detectable antibody
• Equivocal: Borderline or low titer needing further clinical
correlation
• Positive: Defined by manufacturer criteria (e.g., Titer ≥ 1:10)
indicative of possible autoimmune neurological disease
1. LIMITATIONS
• The test is qualitative and may require clinical correlation with
patient symptoms and other diagnostic tests.
• Ensure no contamination during sample handling as false
positives/negatives may occur.
