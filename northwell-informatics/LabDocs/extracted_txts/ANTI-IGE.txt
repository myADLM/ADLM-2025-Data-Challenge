Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase Protocol for Quantitative Anti-IgE Antibody
Testing
1. PURPOSE
To provide a detailed procedure for the accurate and reliable
quantitative measurement of Anti-IgE antibodies in serum or plasma
specimens using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or
similar immunoassay techniques.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of designated laboratory personnel to perform
the assay according to this SOP and ensure that the results are
accurate and properly documented. Supervision of the procedure
should be managed by senior laboratory staff or the laboratory
manager.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred Specimen: Serum or plasma
• Acceptable: EDTA or heparinized plasma collected using standard
venipuncture technique
• Unacceptable: Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric specimens;
specimens collected improperly or without appropriate marking.
Specimens must be transported to the laboratory under stable
conditions and stored at 2-8°C if not processed immediately.
Specimens can be frozen at -20°C or lower for long-term storage.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• ELISA microplate reader
• Pipettes (single-channel and multi-channel)
• Calibrated pipette tips
• ELISA kit specific for Anti-IgE (including coated microplates,
standards, controls, and reagents)
• Timer
• Wash buffer (as provided in the ELISA kit or prepared as per kit
instructions)
• Plate shaker (optional)
• Laboratory glassware and disposables
1. PROCEDURE
A. PREPARATION
1. Set up all equipment and ensure they are calibrated and
working appropriately.
2. Prepare reagents and standards according to the instructions
provided in the ELISA kit.
3. Bring all reagents and specimens to room temperature before
use.
4. Label the microplate wells clearly for standards, controls, and
specimens.
B. ASSAY PROCEDURE
1. Add 100 µL of standards, controls, and specimens to the
appropriate wells of the coated microplate.
2. Incubate the plate for the specified duration at room
temperature or as instructed in the kit insert (typically 1-2
hours).
3. Wash the plate thoroughly with provided wash buffer, making
sure to complete the recommended wash cycles (usually 3-5
washes).
4. Add the enzyme-conjugated secondary antibody to each well
and incubate as per kit instructions.
5. Wash the plate again following the procedure in step 3.
6. Add substrate solution to each well and incubate in the dark
until the color reaction develops (as per kit instructions; typically
around 30 minutes).
7. Stop the reaction by adding the stop solution provided in the
ELISA kit.
C. MEASUREMENT
1. Read the optical density (OD) of each well using an ELISA
microplate reader set to the appropriate wavelength (typically
450nm).
2. Record the OD values and ensure proper documentation in
laboratory records.
3. Generate a standard curve from the OD values of the standards
using appropriate software or manual calculation methods.
D. RESULT CALCULATION
1. Calculate the concentration of Anti-IgE antibodies in the
specimens by interpolating the OD values of the samples onto
the standard curve.
2. Document the concentrations along with QC data on the result
reporting forms and the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
E. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Run positive and negative controls included in the ELISA kit
with each assay batch to ensure accuracy and reliability.
2. Interpret results against predefined criteria for acceptance; if
controls fall outside acceptable ranges, repeat the assay.
F. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Review and verify results ensuring all controls fall within
acceptable ranges.
2. Report results in the LIS according to the laboratory’s reporting
guidelines and reference ranges.
3. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Reference intervals must be established based on validation data or
provided by the manufacturer. Refer to kit instructions for specific
reference ranges.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Ensure to review the limitations detailed in the manufacturer’s
instructions for individual reagent pad limitations and consider any
potential interfering substances.
