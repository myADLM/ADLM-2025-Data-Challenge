Standard Operating Procedure: Analytical Phase of Generating
Results for ANTI-MDA-5 AB (CADM-140)
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the analysis and reporting of
Anti-MDA-5 antibodies (CADM-140) in patient specimens, ensuring
accurate, consistent, and reliable results.
1. SCOPE
This protocol is applicable to all personnel involved in the laboratory
analysis of Anti-MDA-5 antibodies using the designated equipment
and methodologies.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
Laboratory personnel are responsible for following this protocol
during the analysis phase. It is the responsibility of supervisory staff
to ensure protocol adherence, and to address any issues or
deviations that may arise during the analytical process.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Preferred Specimen:
• Serum: 2-4 mL of blood collected into a serum separator tube
(SST).
• Plasma: If serum is not available, EDTA or heparinized plasma
may be used.
Specimen Handling:
• After collection, allow serum samples to clot for 30 minutes at
room temperature.
• Centrifuge the sample at 1,300-2,000 g for 10 minutes and
separate the serum or plasma.
• Store specimens at 2-8°C if analysis will be performed within 24
hours. For longer storage, freeze at -20°C or below.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples should be avoided as they
may interfere with the assay.
• Specimens not properly labeled or without a collection date/time.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit for Anti-MDA-5
antibodies (e.g., CADM-140 ELISA kit).
• Microplate reader capable of measuring absorbance at specified
wavelengths.
• Pipettes and pipette tips (calibrated for accuracy).
• Deionized or distilled water.
• Laboratory timer.
• Incubator (37°C).
• Reagent reservoirs.
• Calibrators and controls as provided in the ELISA kit.
• Disposable gloves and lab coat.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
Quality Control Material:
• Include both negative and positive controls with each assay run.
• Store QC material as per manufacturer’s instructions.
Procedure:
• Run quality control samples (low, medium, and high) with each
assay batch.
• Ensure that control results fall within the specified ranges before
proceeding with patient samples.
• Record and review all QC data. Any deviations from expected QC
results must be investigated and resolved before reporting patient
results.
1. PROCEDURE
Pre-Analytical Preparation:
• Ensure all reagents and samples are brought to room
temperature before use.
• Mix reagents gently but thoroughly without creating bubbles.
Assay Procedure (Example for ELISA):
1. Prepare reagents and samples according to the ELISA kit
instructions.
2. Pipette the required volume of calibrators, controls, and patient
samples into the designated wells.
3. Add the enzyme conjugate to each well and incubate according
to manufacturer's instructions (e.g., 1 hour at 37°C).
4. Wash the plate using the wash buffer solution as directed.
5. Add the substrate solution and incubate for the prescribed time
period in the dark.
6. Add the stop solution to each well and gently tap the plate to
ensure thorough mixing.
7. Measure absorbance at the specified wavelength using a
microplate reader.
Post-Analytical:
• Calculate the concentration of Anti-MDA-5 antibodies in patient
samples based on the standard curve.
• Review all results for consistency and accuracy.
• Ensure that any results falling outside the assay range are
appropriately flagged and reviewed.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Verify and report results according to laboratory protocols.
• Ensure that results are reported in the appropriate units and
reference ranges are included.
• Document and communicate any critical results to the requesting
physician promptly, following established procedures for critical
value reporting.

maintenance of the microplate reader and other lab equipment.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If QC results fail, repeat the assay. If issues persist, investigate
potential sources of error, including reagents, equipment, or
technique.
• Document any procedural deviations or issues encountered
during the assay run.
This protocol provides a guideline to ensure accurate and reliable
results for the detection of Anti-MDA-5 antibodies. Modifications may
be made as needed to align with specific laboratory practices or
updates in methodology.
