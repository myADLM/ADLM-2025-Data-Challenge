ANTI-MI-2 ANTIBODY ANALYSIS SOP
1. PURPOSE
To establish a standardized procedure for the qualitative and
quantitative analysis of ANTI-MI-2 antibodies in patient specimens.
This SOP outlines the responsibilities, specimen requirements,
equipment, reagents, procedure, quality control, reporting of results,
and references.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory staff are responsible for
performing the analysis as per this SOP and ensuring accurate
documentation of results.
All staff must report any issues directly to their supervisor and ensure
proper corrective actions are taken.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred Specimen:
• Serum, collected via venipuncture and stored in a plain red-top or
serum separator tube (SST).
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Hemolyzed samples.
• Specimens collected in heparinized, sodium citrate, or EDTA
tubes.
• Specimens with less than 1 ml of serum.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• ELISA Microplate reader
• Pipettes
• Microplate washer
• Incubator (37 °C)
• Calibration/control material
• ANTI-MI-2 antibody ELISA kit (Commercially available kit with
validated performance characteristics)
• Serum separators
1. PROCEDURE
a) Sample Preparation:
1. Upon receipt, verify sample integrity and label correctness.
2. Centrifuge the serum separator tubes at 2000-3000 RPM for
10-15 minutes to separate serum.
3. Aliquot serum into labeled microtubes for testing. Store at 2-8
°C if testing is delayed.
b) ELISA Assay:
1. Bring all reagents and samples to room temperature.
2. Prepare reagents according to the kit instructions provided by
the manufacturer.
3. Set up the ELISA plate and add the samples, controls, and
standards to appropriate wells.
4. Add the provided conjugate to each well and incubate the plate
at 37 °C for the specified duration.
5. Wash the plate as directed, removing any unbound conjugate.
6. Add substrate solution and incubate for the specified time.
7. Stop the reaction by adding appropriate stop solution.
8. Read the plate using the ELISA microplate reader at the
specified wavelength (usually 450 nm).
c) Calculation and Analysis:
1. Generate a standard curve using control standards; calculate
antibody concentration in patient samples from the standard
curve.
2. Ensure that quality control results are within expected ranges.
3. QUALITY CONTROL
Material:
• Positive and negative controls included in the assay kit.
Procedure:
1. Run positive and negative controls with every batch of samples
analyzed.
2. Record control results and ensure they fall within acceptable
ranges.
3. If control results fall outside acceptable ranges, do not report
patient results. Investigate and resolve issues with the assay.
4. REPORTING RESULTS
5. Review the generated results for each patient sample.
6. Verify the assay validity by checking controls and calculations.
7. Report the results using the laboratory information system
(LIS).
8. For critical results, report immediately to the requesting
physician following the established communication protocol.
9. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Negative: <20 Units/mL
• Borderline: 20-30 Units/mL
• Positive: >30 Units/mL
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the specific manufacturer's package insert for limitations
associated with the assay.
