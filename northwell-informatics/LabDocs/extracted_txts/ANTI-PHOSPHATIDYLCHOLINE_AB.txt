Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Anti-Phosphatidylcholine Antibodies (Anti-PC
AB)
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedures for the analysis
and reporting of Anti-Phosphatidylcholine Antibodies (Anti-PC AB) in
patient specimens. This protocol includes guidelines for the
preparation, analysis, quality control, and reporting of results to
ensure accuracy and reliability.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of designated laboratory staff to adhere to this
SOP to ensure consistent and accurate results. All staff should report
any deviations or irregularities to their supervisor immediately.
1. SPECIMEN
Preferred/acceptable:
• Serum collected in a serum separator tube (SST).
• Plasma collected in a heparinized or EDTA tube.
Unacceptable:
• Specimens that are hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric.
• Specimens collected in anticoagulants other than heparin or
EDTA.
• Specimens that are not labeled appropriately with patient
identification.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• ELISA reader and washer
• Pipettes and tips
• Plate shaker
• Incubator
• Appropriate ELISA kit for Anti-Phosphatidylcholine Antibodies
(commercially available, e.g., from a certified supplier)
• Positive and negative control sera
• Deionized or distilled water
• Laboratory tubes and racks
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
1. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Handling and Preparation:
• Ensure specimens are properly labeled and accompanied by a
matching requisition form.
• Centrifuge blood specimens as necessary to obtain serum or
plasma.
• Store specimens at 2-8°C if not tested immediately. For prolonged
storage, freeze at -20°C or lower. Avoid repeated freeze-thaw
cycles.
B. Test Procedure (Refer to manufacturer's ELISA kit insert for
detailed instructions):
1. Bring all reagents, specimens, and controls to room
temperature prior to testing.
2. Prepare all reagents, calibrators, controls, and samples
according to the manufacturer's instructions.
3. Pipette a specified volume (usually 100 µL) of calibration
standards, controls, and patient samples into designated wells
of the microplate.
4. Incubate the plate for the required time as specified in the kit
insert, typically 30-60 minutes at room temperature.
5. Wash the plate thoroughly, following the manufacturer's
washing instructions to remove all unbound material.
6. Add the appropriate enzyme conjugate to each well.
7. Incubate the plate at room temperature for the specified time.
8. Wash the plate again to remove unbound conjugate.
9. Add the substrate solution to each well and incubate in the dark
for the specified time.
10. Add the stop solution to each well to terminate the reaction.
11. Read the absorbance of each well at the appropriate
wavelength (typically 450 nm) using an ELISA reader.
C. Calculation and Interpretation of Results:
1. Generate a standard curve using the absorbance values of the
calibrators.
2. Calculate the concentration of Anti-PC antibodies in patient
samples by interpolating the absorbance values on the
standard curve.
3. Report quantitative results according to the laboratory's
standard reporting format.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run positive and negative controls with each batch of samples.
• Verify that control results fall within the established acceptable
range before reporting patient results.
• Document all quality control results in a logbook or appropriate
software.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
promptly and accurately.
• Provide a clear interpretation of results based on reference
intervals established by the test kit manufacturer or the laboratory.
• Review and verify all results prior to releasing them to ensure they
meet quality standards.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Reference intervals should be established from a healthy
population or as specified by the test kit manufacturer.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to the manufacturer's ELISA kit insert for information on
assay limitations and interfering substances.
• Results should be interpreted in the context of the patient's clinical
history and other laboratory findings.

1. REVIEW AND APPROVAL
This SOP must be reviewed annually and approved by the laboratory
director. Any updates or revisions should be documented and
communicated to all relevant staff.
