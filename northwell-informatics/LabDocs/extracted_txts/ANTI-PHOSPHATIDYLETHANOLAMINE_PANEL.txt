Anti-Phosphatidylethanolamine (aPE) Antibody Panel
1. Purpose
This protocol outlines the procedure for the analytical phase of
generating results for the Anti-Phosphatidylethanolamine (aPE)
antibody panel to ensure accurate and reliable results.
2. Scope
This procedure applies to all designated laboratory personnel
involved in the analysis of Anti-Phosphatidylethanolamine antibodies
in human serum samples. The Anti-Phosphatidylethanolamine Panel
is used to aid in the diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome (APS).
3. Responsibilities
• Designated Laboratory Personnel:
◦ Perform the analysis according to the procedure outlined.
◦ Document all steps, observations, calculations, and results
related to the procedure.
◦ Ensure that quality control is maintained and correct any
deviations from the protocol.
• Supervisors:
◦ Provide training to the laboratory personnel on this procedure.
◦ Ensure all personnel adhere to the protocol.
◦ Address and document any non-conformance incidents and
implement corrective actions.
4. Materials and Equipment
• Reagents:
◦ Anti-Phosphatidylethanolamine antibody test kit
◦ Control reagents (Positive and Negative controls)
◦ Wash buffer, substrate solution, stop solution (provided in the
kit)
• Equipment:
◦ Microplate reader (capable of reading absorbance at 450 nm)
◦ Calibrated micropipettes (20 µL to 200 µL)
◦ Microcentrifuge
◦ 96-well microtiter plates (provided in the kit)
◦ Incubator (37°C)
◦ Timer
◦ Laboratory glassware (beakers, cylinders)
◦ Personal protective equipment (lab coat, gloves, safety
glasses)
5. Specimen Requirements
• Acceptable Specimens:
◦ Serum samples collected in standard serum separator tubes
(SST).
• Storage and Stability:
◦ Serum samples should be stored at 2-8°C if assayed within 48
hours.
◦ For long-term storage, aliquot and store samples at -20°C or
lower.
◦ Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
6. Quality Control
• Run positive and negative controls with each batch.
• Verify that control results fall within the established acceptable
range before proceeding with patient samples.
• Record all control results and any corrective actions taken.
7. Procedure
A. Preparation:
1. Bring all reagents and samples to room temperature before
starting the assay.
2. Label the microtiter plate as needed for standards, controls,
and samples.
B. Assay Procedure:
1. Sample and Reagent Addition:
◦ Pipette 100 µL of sample diluent into each well.
◦ Add 10 µL of patient serum, positive control, and negative
control into the designated wells.
◦ Mix gently on a microplate shaker for 30 seconds.
2. Incubation:
◦ Cover the plate with an adhesive film.
◦ Incubate at room temperature for 30 minutes.
3. Washing:
◦ Aspirate and wash each well 5 times with the wash buffer.
◦ After the last wash, invert the plate and blot on absorbent
paper to remove any residual wash buffer.
4. Conjugate Addition:
◦ Add 100 µL of enzyme conjugate into each well.
◦ Incubate the plate at room temperature for 30 minutes.
5. Repeat Washing:
◦ Repeat the washing procedure as in step 3.
6. Substrate Addition:
◦ Add 100 µL of substrate solution into each well.
◦ Allow the reaction to develop at room temperature for 15
minutes without exposing the plate to direct sunlight.
7. Stop Reaction:
◦ Add 100 µL of stop solution to each well.
8. Reading:
◦ Measure the absorbance of each well at 450 nm using a
microplate reader within 30 minutes of adding the stop
solution.
C. Calculation of Results:
1. Determine the average absorbance values for each standard
and control.
2. Create a standard curve by plotting the mean absorbance
values of standards against their concentrations.
3. Use the standard curve to interpolate the concentrations of aPE
antibodies in patient samples.
4. Multiply the calculated values by dilution factor if a pre-dilution
was performed.
D. Interpretation of Results:
• Compare the patient results with the established reference ranges
for aPE antibodies.
• Report results according to the laboratory's reporting guidelines,
including any critical values.
8. Reporting Results
• Results should be documented in the Laboratory Information
System (LIS) and interpreted according to the established
reference intervals.
• Critical values must be communicated promptly to the healthcare
provider and recorded as per the laboratory’s critical value
reporting policy.
9. Reference Intervals
• Established based on the healthy population data:
◦ aPE (IgG): <20 IU/mL (Negative)
◦ aPE (IgM): <15 IU/mL (Negative)
• Repeat testing is recommended for borderline/equivocal results.
10. Method Limitations
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples may interfere with the
assay results.
• Certain medications and clinical conditions may affect antibody
levels.
11. References
• Manufacturer’s instructions and kit inserts for the Anti-
Phosphatidylethanolamine antibody kit.
• CLSI guidelines for immunoassays.
12. Document Control
• Ensure the protocol is reviewed annually or as required due to
procedures updates.
• This document will be kept in the laboratory SOP manual and be
accessible to all laboratory personnel.
By following this standard operating procedure, laboratory personnel
ensure that the testing for the Anti-Phosphatidylethanolamine
antibody panel is accurate, reliable, and reproducible.
