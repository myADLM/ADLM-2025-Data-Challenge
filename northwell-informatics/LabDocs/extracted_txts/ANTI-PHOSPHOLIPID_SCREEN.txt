Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Anti-Phospholipid
Screen
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedure for the analysis
of Anti-Phospholipid Screen in the laboratory. This procedure ensures
consistent, accurate, and reliable results.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory staff performing and verifying
the Anti-Phospholipid Screen test.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
Laboratory personnel are responsible for:
• Performing the Anti-Phospholipid Screen analysis as per this
SOP.
• Ensuring quality control measures are in place.
• Reporting and verifying results.
4. DEFINITIONS
Anti-Phospholipid Screen: A diagnostic test used to detect antibodies
against phospholipids, which are associated with autoimmune
disorders such as antiphospholipid syndrome (APS).
5. EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS
• Microplate reader or ELISA reader
• Pipettes and tips (calibrated)
• Disposable gloves
• Reagents and assay kits for Anti-Phospholipid Screen (acquired
from accredited suppliers)
• Laboratory protocol forms and logs
6. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• Anti-Phospholipid Screen ELISA kit
• Reagent solutions (e.g., wash buffer, substrate solution)
• Positive and negative controls
• Sample diluent
• Recording sheets/log books
7. SPECIMEN
Preferred/acceptable:
• Serum samples collected in red-top or SST (serum separator
tube).
• Specimens should be centrifuged promptly, and serum separated
within 2 hours of collection.
• Store serum samples at 2-8°C if not processed immediately.
Samples can be frozen at -20°C for longer storage.
Unacceptable:
• Serum samples collected in EDTA, heparin, or citrated tubes.
• Specimens hemolyzed or with visible contamination.
• Specimens stored at incorrect temperatures or conditions that
may compromise integrity.
8. PROCEDURE
A) PREPARATION:
• Ensure all reagents and equipment required for the test are
prepared and accessible.
• Wear personal protective equipment (PPE) including gloves, lab
coat, and eye protection.
B) QUALITY CONTROL:
• Prior to initiation, perform quality control checks using positive
and negative controls provided with the kit.
• Record quality control results.
C) TEST ANALYSIS:
1. Sample Preparation: a. Allow serum samples to come to room
temperature. b. Dilute samples as specified in the assay kit
instructions. c. Load samples onto the microplate as indicated.
2. Addition of Reagents: a. Follow the specific steps detailed in
the ELISA kit instructions for reagent addition. b. Ensure proper
incubation times at specified temperatures.
3. Wash Steps: a. Perform wash steps meticulously to avoid
cross-contamination. b. Use fresh wash buffer for each cycle.
4. Detection and Analysis: a. Add substrate solution and
incubate as per kit instructions. b. Measure absorbance using a
microplate reader at the recommended wavelength.
D) DATA RECORDING AND VERIFICATION:
• Collect raw data and check for consistency and accuracy.
• Calculate results based on provided software or manual
calculation instructions.
• Enter results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
9. REPORTING RESULTS
• Verify results against established reference ranges.
• Report results in accordance with site-specific guidelines.
• Flag and report critical values according to laboratory protocol.
10. QUALITY CONTROL AND TROUBLESHOOTING
• Monitor assay performance using control samples.
• Document any deviations or anomalies and perform
troubleshooting steps.
• Reassess controls and repeat analysis if necessary.
11. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Anti-Phospholipid antibodies reference values may vary by
method. Refer to the assay kit documentation for specific
intervals.
12. LIMITATIONS
• Ensure awareness of the assay limitations as per kit
documentation.
• Note any potential interferences or cross-reactivity.
13. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's instructions for the Anti-Phospholipid Screen
ELISA kit.
• Laboratory internal standards and guidelines.
14. DOCUMENTATION
• All steps, observations, and results should be documented in
laboratory records and logs.
• Ensure compliance with regulatory documentation requirements.
15. REVIEW AND UPDATE
• This SOP should be reviewed annually or as required to reflect
changes in practice or guidelines.
By adhering to this SOP, laboratory staff will ensure accurate,
reliable, and consistent results for Anti-Phospholipid Screen
analyses.
