Standard Operating Procedures for ANTI-PM/SCL-100 AB
Analysis
1. PURPOSE
This procedure outlines the steps necessary for accurately analyzing
and reporting ANTI-PM/SCL-100 AB results in the laboratory. The aim
is to ensure consistency, reliability, and accuracy of test outcomes to
assist in the diagnosis of polymyositis, scleroderma, and other
related conditions.
Responsibility:
• Designated staff must perform the test according to this SOP and
document all results accordingly.
• All staff members are responsible for identifying deficiencies that
may affect the accuracy of test results and promptly reporting
these to a supervisor.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring the procedure is
followed carefully and remedial actions are promptly
implemented.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/Acceptable Specimens:
• Serum collected using a SST (serum separator tube) or plain red-
top tube.
• Minimum volume: 1 mL serum.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens that are hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric.
• Specimens collected in inappropriate tubes like EDTA, citrate, or
heparin.
• Specimens that are not processed within specified stability times
or improperly stored.
Specimen Stability:
• Room temperature: 48 hours.
• Refrigerated (2-8°C): 7 days.
• Frozen (-20°C or colder): 6 months.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Analytical platform (e.g., ELISA, immunoblot).
• ANTI-PM/SCL-100 AB test kits validated for the analytical
platform.
• Micropipettes and calibrated tips.
• Plate reader capable of reading at the appropriate wavelength for
the assay.
• Standard laboratory PPE (gloves, lab coat, eye protection).
1. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation of Reagents and Equipment
• Allow all reagents and samples to reach room temperature before
use.
• Prepare reagents as specified in the kit insert guidelines.
• Calibrate the plate reader and micropipettes prior to the assay.
B) Sample Preparation and Dilution
• Thaw frozen samples at room temperature and mix well before
use.
• For dilution, follow the protocol recommended by the kit
manufacturer; usually, serum samples are diluted according to
specific instructions (e.g., 1:100).
C) Running the Assay
1. ELISA Method
i. Add standards, controls, and patient samples to the
microwells according to the kit instructions. ii. Incubate at the
specified temperature and duration as per the kit instructions.
iii. Wash the plates to remove unbound antibody or antigen. iv.
Add the conjugate and incubate as instructed. v. Wash again
and add the substrate solution. Incubate for the recommended
time. vi. Stop the reaction using the provided stop solution and
read the absorbance at the specified wavelength using a plate
reader.
2. Immunoblot Method
i. Load standards, controls, and patient samples on the blotting
device as per the manufacturer's instructions. ii. Incubate and
wash accordingly. iii. Apply the detection reagents stepwise. iv.
Develop the blot as per the developed protocol and read results
based on the appearance of bands corresponding to the ANTI-
PM/SCL-100 AB.
Note: Detailed procedures can be found in the manufacturer's insert
provided with the specific assay kit being used.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Use two levels of quality control (positive and negative) with each
assay run to ensure the accuracy and reliability of results.
• QC results must fall within established ranges; if not, the run is
invalid and must be repeated.
• Document all QC activities, including lot numbers and expiration
dates of reagents.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Review raw data output from the plate reader or blot results
carefully.
• Report results according to the laboratory information system
(LIS) guidelines.
• Include comments on any deviations or anomalies observed
during the test run.
• Critical results must be promptly communicated to requesting
clinicians.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's kit insert for ANTI-PM/SCL-100 AB assay.
• Laboratory Quality Management System documentation.
• Relevant clinical guidelines on polymyositis and scleroderma
antibody testing.
1. RECORD KEEPING
• Retain all records of specimen processing, assay runs, quality
control, and results reporting for a minimum of 2 years.
• Ensure all entries are accurate, complete, and legible.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING
Refer to the manufacturer's troubleshooting guide included with the
assay kit. For persistent issues, contact technical support for further
guidance.
1. MAINTENANCE OF EQUIPMENT
• Perform regular maintenance and calibration of the plate reader
and micropipettes according to the manufacturer’s
recommendations.
• Document all maintenance activities and calibration results.
By adhering to these guidelines, laboratory personnel can ensure the
reliable generation of ANTI-PM/SCL-100 AB results, contributing to
accurate patient diagnosis and care.
