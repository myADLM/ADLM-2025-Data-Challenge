Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) ANTI-RETINAL
AUTOANTIBODIES FOLLOW UP, WB
1. PURPOSE To provide a detailed and standardized protocol for the
analysis of anti-retinal autoantibodies in whole blood samples,
ensuring accuracy and consistency of results, and to detail the steps
necessary to generate patient results for follow-up testing.
2. RESPONSIBILITY All trained and certified laboratory scientists
and technicians are responsible for performing the procedures as
described in this SOP. Supervisors are responsible for ensuring that
the procedures are followed correctly and for addressing any issues
that arise during testing.
3. DEFINITIONS
• Whole Blood (WB): The sample type collected from patients for
this test.
• Anti-Retinal Autoantibodies: Autoantibodies targeting retinal
antigens, important in diagnosing autoimmune retinopathy.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Preferred Specimen:
• Whole Blood collected in a RED-TOP tube without anticoagulant.
Specimen Stability:
• Store at 2-8°C; stable for up to 48 hours.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Microplate reader capable of measuring absorbance at 450 nm
with a correction of 540 nm.
• ELISA Kit for Anti-Retinal Autoantibodies.
• Calibrators, controls, and patient specimens.
• Automated pipettes.
• 96-well ELISA plates.
• Plate washer.
• Timer.
• Distilled water.
6. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Verification of Temperature and Equipment:
◦ Ensure the laboratory's ambient temperature and humidity
are within limits: 20-26°C and 15-85%, respectively.
◦ Verify that the plate reader and washer are functioning
correctly and calibrated as per manufacturer and laboratory
protocols.
2. Reagent Preparation:
◦ Allow all reagents to reach room temperature before use.
◦ Prepare wash buffer and any necessary diluents as directed
by the kit manufacturer.
◦ Dilute patient samples as required (typically 1:100).
3. Plate Setup:
◦ Allocate wells for standards, controls, and patient samples.
Include blanks and duplicates where necessary.
Assay Protocol:
1. Step-by-Step Process: a. Add 100 µL of standards, controls,
and diluted patient samples to the assigned wells. b. Incubate
the plate at room temperature for 60 minutes. c. Wash the plate
5 times using the plate washer with an appropriate wash buffer.
d. Add 100 µL of the enzyme-linked secondary antibody to each
well. e. Incubate the plate at room temperature for 30 minutes.
f. Wash the plate as described above. g. Add 100 µL of
substrate solution to each well. h. Incubate the plate in the dark
at room temperature for 15 minutes. i. Add 50 µL of stop
solution to each well to terminate the reaction.
2. Reading the Plate:
◦ Measure the absorbance of each well at 450 nm using the
microplate reader with a correction at 540 nm.
Results Calculation and Interpretation:
1. Calibration Curve:
◦ Generate a standard curve using the absorbance of
calibrators.
◦ Calculate the concentration of anti-retinal autoantibodies in
patient samples based on the standard curve.
2. Quality Control:
◦ Verify that control values fall within the expected ranges.
◦ Reassay if control samples are outside of acceptable limits.
3. Reporting Results:
◦ Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
◦ Review and verify each patient's results, ensuring no errors
or anomalies.
◦ Notify the supervising technologist if any unusual results are
encountered.
◦ Follow site-specific guidelines for critical values and
automatic transmission to the patient's electronic health
record (EHR).
7. QUALITY CONTROL AND MAINTENANCE
1. Daily Quality Control:
◦ Analyze quality control samples at the beginning of each
run.
◦ Document all QC results on appropriate logs.
2. Routine Maintenance:
◦ Follow manufacturer guidelines for routine maintenance of
the plate reader and washer.
◦ Log all maintenance activities and any issues encountered.
8. TROUBLESHOOTING
1. Control Failures:
◦ If quality control samples are outside acceptable limits,
investigate potential causes such as reagent integrity,
pipetting errors, or equipment malfunction.
◦ Perform recalibration or repeat the assay if necessary.
◦ Notify the supervisor for further guidance if problems persist.
2. Instrument Errors:
◦ If an instrument error occurs, troubleshoot according to the
manufacturer's instructions and document the issue along
with any corrective actions taken.
