Standard Operating Procedure Analytical Phase for ANTI-RNP
ANTIBODY, SERUM
1. PURPOSE To outline the procedures for the detection and
quantification of Anti-RNP Antibody in serum using an ELISA
(Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay) method. This protocol
ensures accurate and consistent results that aid in diagnosing
connective tissue diseases, including mixed connective tissue
disease (MCTD), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and
others.
Responsibility: It is the responsibility of the trained laboratory
technologist to perform the Anti-RNP Antibody assay according to this
SOP, including pre- and post-analytical considerations, quality
control, and documentation.
1. DEFINITION Anti-RNP (ribonucleoprotein) antibodies are
autoantibodies targeting a complex of RNA and proteins,
frequently observed in various autoimmune conditions.
2. REAGENTS AND MATERIALS • ELISA kit for Anti-RNP
Antibody detection (Ensure it's not expired and match the lot
number with the provided QC sheet) • Micropipettes and tips •
Laboratory-grade distilled water • Automated or semi-
automated ELISA plate washer (if available) • ELISA plate
reader • Serum samples • Positive and negative control sera •
Washing buffer (usually provided with the ELISA kit) • Substrate
solution (typically TMB - 3,3',5,5'-Tetramethylbenzidine) • Stop
solution (commonly 1 M H2SO4 or equivalent)
3. SAMPLE REQUIREMENTS AND HANDLING • Ensure proper
specimen collection and handling. Serum should be separated
from cells within 2 hours of collection and stored at -20°C if not
tested immediately. • Thawed serum samples must be at room
temperature before analysis.
4. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation:
1. Allow all reagents, serum samples, and controls to reach room
temperature (20-25°C) before starting the assay.
2. Label microtiter plate wells according to the number of tests
needed, including blanks, standards, controls, and patient
samples.
B) Assay Procedure:
1. Add 100 µL of standards, controls, and patient serum samples
to the appropriate wells.
2. Incubate the microtiter plate for the time specified in the ELISA
kit insert, typically 30-60 minutes at room temperature.
3. Wash the wells 3-5 times with the washing buffer provided by
the ELISA kit, ensuring no residual liquid remains after the final
wash.
4. Add 100 µL of the enzyme-conjugate solution (secondary
antibody) to each well.
5. Incubate for the specified time at room temperature (usually
30-60 minutes).
6. Wash the wells 3-5 times with washing buffer.
7. Add 100 µL of the substrate solution (TMB) to each well.
8. Incubate according to the ELISA kit instructions (typically 10-20
minutes) until a blue color develops.
9. Add 100 µL of stop solution to each well. The color changes
from blue to yellow.
10. Immediately read the absorbance at 450 nm using an ELISA
plate reader.
C) Reading Results:
1. Measure the absorbance of each well at 450 nm within 30
minutes after adding the stop solution.
2. Record the O.D. (optical density) values for all samples,
standards, and controls.
3. CALCULATION OF RESULTS
4. Plot a standard curve using the O.D. values obtained from the
standards provided in the kit.
5. Determine the concentration of Anti-RNP antibodies in patient
samples by comparing their O.D. values to the standard curve.
6. Express results in Units/mL or titer as required by the kit
instructions.
7. QUALITY CONTROL • Run positive and negative controls with
every batch of tests. • Results must fall within the
manufacturer's recommended range. • If controls do not meet
specifications, the run is invalid and must be repeated.
8. REPORTING RESULTS • Document all results, including
standards, controls, and patient values. • Report patient results
based on the standard curve and include interpretative criteria
as per kit instructions.
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS Refer to the ELISA kit insert for
specific method limitations including cross-reactivity,
interference, and assay sensitivity.

instruction manual. • Quality control guidelines and procedures
specific to the laboratory’s quality management system.
By following this SOP, the laboratory ensures consistent and reliable
results in detecting and quantifying Anti-RNP antibodies in serum.
Should any issues arise, inform a supervisor immediately and
document per the lab’s protocols.
