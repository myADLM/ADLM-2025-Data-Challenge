Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase of Generating Results for ANTI-SAE1 AB, IGG
1. Purpose To provide a standardized procedure for the
determination of anti-SAE1 IgG antibodies in human serum or
plasma samples using an appropriate immunoassay.
2. Scope This procedure applies to laboratory personnel trained to
perform the anti-SAE1 IgG antibody test and interpret results.
3. Responsibility It is the responsibility of the laboratory
technologist to ensure proper performance of the immunoassay
according to procedures, document activities, and report test
results.
4. Materials and Equipment
• Serum or plasma sample
• Calibrators and controls (Negative and Positive)
• Reagent kit for Anti-SAE1 IgG antibody test (Refer to the specific
reagent kit insert)
• Micropipettes and tips
• Plate reader capable of reading absorbance at specified
wavelengths (as per kit instructions)
• Incubator (if required by reagent kit)
• Wash buffer
• Distilled or deionized water
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
1. Procedure
5.1. Preparation
1. Ensure the samples have been properly collected, received,
and accessioned.
2. Verify the samples and controls are stored at the appropriate
temperature prior to analysis.
3. Thaw serum or plasma samples, calibrators, and controls to
room temperature if they were previously frozen. Mix well
before analysis without inducing foam.
5.2. Calibration and Quality Control
1. Perform a calibration curve using the standards provided in the
assay kit.
2. Run positive and negative controls alongside patient samples to
ensure assay validity.
3. Record the calibration and quality control results. Ensure they
are within the manufacturer’s recommended ranges prior to
processing patient samples.
5.3. Assay Procedure
1. Load the appropriate number of wells on the assay plate as per
the number of samples, standards, and controls.
2. Follow the immunoassay kit protocol for addition of samples,
controls, and reagents. This usually involves the following
steps: i. Add a specified volume of each prepared sample,
standard, and control to the designated wells. ii. Add the
detection reagent (enzyme-conjugate antibody specific for
human IgG). iii. Incubate the plate for a specified time at the
recommended temperature to allow antigen-antibody
interaction. iv. Perform wash steps as indicated in the assay
protocol to remove unbound material. v. Add the substrate
solution and incubate to allow color development. vi. Stop the
reaction by adding a stop solution.
3. Read the absorbance of each well using a plate reader at the
specified optical density (OD) wavelength indicated in the kit
protocol.
5.4. Result Interpretation
1. Generate a standard curve by plotting the absorbance of the
standards against their concentrations using appropriate
software.
2. Determine the concentration of anti-SAE1 IgG antibodies in the
patient samples by comparing their absorbance to the standard
curve.
3. Record the final results in the laboratory information system
(LIS).
4. Reporting Results
5. Verify the results ensuring the quality control parameters are
within acceptable limits.
6. Report patient results in accordance with laboratory policy,
including any necessary comments or notes.
7. Critical values or abnormal findings must be flagged and
reported to the relevant healthcare provider following the
laboratory’s critical result reporting protocol.
8. Quality Control and Assurance
9. Perform quality control measures in accordance with the
laboratory’s quality management system.
10. Ensure all instrument calibrations and maintenance are up to
date.
11. Train all personnel performing the assay to ensure competency
and adherence to this SOP.
12. Document any deviations or issues encountered during the
assay and take corrective actions as necessary.

1. Records and Documentation
2. Ensure all records of sample processing, QC, calibration, and
patient results are maintained accurately.
3. Document any corrective actions taken in case of deviations.
4. Safety and Precautions
5. Use appropriate PPE while handling biological specimens and
reagents.
6. Follow proper disposal procedures for biohazardous waste.
7. Refer to the reagent kit MSDS for information on handling and
hazards.
