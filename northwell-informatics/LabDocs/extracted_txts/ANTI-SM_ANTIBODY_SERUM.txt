STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE
ANTI-SM ANTIBODY, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
This procedure outlines the steps for analyzing and generating
results for Anti-Sm Antibody in serum. This protocol ensures the
accuracy, reliability, and consistency of test results in our CLIA-
certified laboratory.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
Personnel performing this assay must be trained and competent in
the relevant techniques and instrumentation. It is imperative for staff
to ensure that all procedures are followed as stipulated and all results
are accurately documented and reported.
3. SPECIMEN
a. Specimen Type: Serum b. Collection: i. Collect blood using
standard phlebotomy techniques. ii. Allow the blood to clot by leaving
it undisturbed at room temperature (15-30 minutes). iii. Centrifuge at
1300-1800 x g for 10 minutes to obtain serum. iv. Transfer serum to a
clean, labeled tube and store at 2-8°C if analysis will be performed
within 48 hours. For longer storage, freeze serum aliquots at -20°C or
below.
c. Unacceptable Specimen: i. Hemolyzed specimens. ii. Lipemic
specimens. iii. Specimens received at the laboratory in an un-labeled
or incorrectly labeled container.
4. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
a. Equipment: i. Centrifuge ii. Micropipettes and tips iii. Incubator set
at 37°C iv. ELISA reader with 450 nm wavelength filter v. Water bath
(37°C)
b. Reagents: i. Anti-Sm antibody ELISA kit ii. Wash buffer iii.
Substrate solution iv. Stop solution v. Standards and controls
5. PROCEDURE
a. Preparation: i. Bring all reagents and specimens to room
temperature before use. ii. Thoroughly mix serum specimens before
testing. iii. Prepare wash buffer as instructed by the kit insert.
b. Assay Set-up: i. Add 100 µL of diluted standards, controls, and
specimens to the appropriate wells in duplicate. ii. Incubate the plate
at 37°C for 30 minutes. iii. Wash the wells 3 times with the prepared
wash buffer. Tap plate on absorbent paper to remove residual liquid.
iv. Add 100 µL of enzyme conjugate to each well. v. Incubate at 37°C
for 30 minutes. vi. Wash the wells 5 times with wash buffer as
described earlier. vii. Add 100 µL of substrate solution to each well.
viii. Incubate in the dark at room temperature for 10 minutes. ix. Add
100 µL of stop solution to each well.
c. Reading and Interpretation: i. Read the absorbance of each well
at 450 nm within 30 minutes of adding the stop solution. ii. Generate
a standard curve by plotting the mean absorbance for each standard
on the y-axis against the concentration on the x-axis. iii. Use the
standard curve to determine the concentration of Anti-Sm Antibody in
patient samples.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
a. Internal Quality Controls: i. Run positive and negative controls
each time the assay is performed. ii. Acceptable control results
should fall within the established range provided by the kit
manufacturer.
b. External Quality Controls: i. Participate in an external proficiency
testing program. ii. Document and review Quality Control data
regularly to identify trends or shifts that require investigation.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
Results should be recorded in the Laboratory Information System
(LIS). Results indicating abnormal or critical levels should be
rechecked and verified. Critical values must be reported immediately
to the requesting healthcare provider in accordance with the
laboratory's policies.
8. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Negative: < Cut-off value provided by the manufacturer
• Positive: ≥ Cut-off value
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Results may be affected by incorrect specimen handling, reagent
preparation, or laboratory conditions. Cross-reactions with other
autoantibodies or interfering substances may lead to false-positive or
false-negative results. Refer to the manufacturer’s product insert for
specific limitations.
10. REFERENCES
Refer to the Anti-Sm Antibody ELISA kit insert and manufacturer's
guidelines for detailed information on the assay principles,
performance characteristics, and troubleshooting.
11. REVISION RECORD
Document changes to this SOP by recording the date of revision,
revised by, and changes made.
This protocol is effective as of October 2023 and remains in effect
until updated or revised. All personnel performing this assay must
adhere strictly to this SOP.
