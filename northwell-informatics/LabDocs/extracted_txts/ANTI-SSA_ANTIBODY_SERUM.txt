Standard Operating Procedure for Generating Results for ANTI-
SSA ANTIBODY, SERUM
1. Purpose and Scope
The purpose of this procedure is to outline the steps required for the
analysis of ANTI-SSA ANTIBODY in human serum. This test is used
for the diagnosis of autoimmune diseases, particularly Sjogren's
Syndrome and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE).
1. Specimen Requirements
Specimen Type: Serum
Acceptable Collection Containers: Serum separator tube (SST) or a
red-top tube.
Specimen Volume: Minimum required volume is 500 µL of serum.
Specimen Stability:
• Room Temperature: 8 hours
• Refrigerated (2-8°C): 72 hours
• Frozen (-20°C or below): Extended periods up to 6 months
Unacceptable Specimen Conditions:
• Grossly hemolyzed specimens
• Lipemic specimens
• Specimens not properly labeled with patient identifiers
1. Responsibilities
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the
analysis, verifying the results, and ensuring all steps are carried out
according to this protocol. Any inconsistencies or issues are to be
reported to the laboratory supervisor.
1. Equipment and Reagents
• Automated Immunoassay Analyzer (such as ELISA or
Chemiluminescence analyzer)
• SSA (Ro) Antibody Kit
• Calibrators and Control Sera
• Micropipettes and tips
• Vortex mixer
• Centrifuge
1. Calibration and Quality Control
• Perform calibration of the analyzer as per the manufacturer's
instructions before performing the test. Use calibrators provided in
the assay kit.
• Run quality control samples (Positive and Negative Controls) at
the beginning of each shift or every 24 hours. Quality control
results must be within the acceptable range before patient
samples can be analyzed.
• Document all calibration and quality control data in the
appropriate logs.
1. Procedure
A. Preparation of Specimens:
1. Centrifuge the blood collection tube at 1500 x g for 10 minutes
to obtain serum.
2. Carefully transfer serum to a labeled secondary tube, avoiding
the transfer of blood cells.
3. Store specimens at 2-8°C until analysis if processing within 72
hours, or freeze at -20°C for longer storage.
B. Loading the Analyzer:
1. Allow all reagents and specimens to reach room temperature
(18-25°C) before use.
2. Program the analyzer according to the kit insert or
manufacturer's protocol for ANTI-SSA ANTIBODY testing.
3. Vortex each reagent vial, calibrator, quality control and
specimen tube briefly to ensure homogeneity.
4. Pipette the required volume of reagents, controls, calibrators,
and patient samples into the designated wells or sample cups.
5. Load the reagents, controls, calibrators, and patient samples
onto the analyzer.
C. Running the Assay:
1. Start the run on the analyzer and ensure all steps are carried
out automatically as per the manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Monitor the analyzer for any error messages or alerts.
3. Upon completion of the run, review the quality control results to
confirm they are within acceptable limits.
D. Result Verification and Interpretation:
1. Verify the test results from the analyzer’s output.
2. Compare the quality control and calibrator results against the
predetermined criteria.
3. Interpret the ANTI-SSA ANTIBODY results as either Negative or
Positive based on the cut-off values provided by the kit
manufacturer.
4. Reporting of Results
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
following the verification.
• For positive results, include a comment indicating the clinical
significance suggesting further clinical correlation.
• Ensure results are reviewed and verified before final reporting.
1. Reference Intervals
• Negative: < [kit-specific cut-off value] units/mL
• Positive: ≥ [kit-specific cut-off value] units/mL
1. Method Limitations
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples may affect the result’s
accuracy.
• Autoantibody testing is only one part of the diagnostic process.
Clinical correlation and other diagnostic testing may be necessary.
