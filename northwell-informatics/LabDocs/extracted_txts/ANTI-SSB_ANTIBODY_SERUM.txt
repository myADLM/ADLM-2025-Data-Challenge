Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for ANTI-SSB ANTIBODY,
SERUM
1. PURPOSE
To outline the protocol for processing and generating results for Anti-
SSB (La) Antibody in serum samples, ensuring consistency,
accuracy, and reliability of test results.
1. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel involved in the
analytical phase of the Anti-SSB Antibody testing process.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
• It is the responsibility of designated laboratory personnel to follow
this SOP precisely.
• The supervisor is responsible for ensuring the procedure is
understood and adhered to by all relevant staff members.
1. DEFINITION
Anti-SSB (La) antibodies are autoantibodies directed against the La
protein and are often associated with connective tissue diseases,
including Sjögren's syndrome and systemic lupus erythematosus
(SLE).
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type: Serum
Volume: Minimum 1 mL of serum
Collection: Blood should be collected in a standard red-top or serum
separator tube (SST). Allow the blood to clot and then centrifuge to
separate serum.
Stability: Store serum samples at 2-8°C if delays in testing are
anticipated. For long-term storage beyond 48 hours, serum should be
aliquoted and frozen at -20°C or lower.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• ELISA Kit for Anti-SSB Antibody detection (specific to
manufacturer; e.g., Euroimmun, Inova, etc.)
• Microplate reader capable of measuring absorbance at 450 nm
and reference wavelength at 620-650 nm
• Incubator (37°C)
• Precision pipettes and tips
• Distilled water
• Timer
• Laboratory reagent-grade chemicals as specified by the ELISA
manufacturer
1. PROCEDURE
A. Pre-Analytical Phase
1. Verify that the serum sample has been properly collected,
labeled, and stored.
2. Ensure all reagents and samples are at room temperature
before starting the assay.
3. Prepare reagents and samples according to the manufacturer's
instructions included in the ELISA kit.
B. Analytical Phase
1. Sample Preparation
◦ Dilute serum samples as instructed by the ELISA kit
manufacturer (usually 1:100 or as specified).
2. Assay Procedure
◦ Add the required volume of diluted serum (e.g., 100 μL) to
each well of a pre-coated ELISA plate, ensuring precise and
careful pipetting to avoid cross-contamination.
◦ Include calibrators, positive and negative controls as defined
by the ELISA kit manufacturer.
◦ Incubate the plate at 37°C for the recommended time (e.g.,
30 minutes to 1 hour).
◦ Wash the plate as directed, typically using an automated or
manual plate washer with the specified wash buffer.
◦ Add the enzyme-conjugate reagent (100 μL) to each well
and incubate at 37°C for the recommended time.
◦ Wash the plate thoroughly again as directed.
◦ Add substrate solution (e.g., 100 μL TMB) to each well and
incubate at room temperature in the dark for the specified
duration (e.g., 10-20 minutes).
◦ Terminate the reaction by adding the stop solution (e.g., 100
μL).
3. Measurement
◦ Measure the absorbance of each well at 450 nm with a
reference wavelength of 620-650 nm using a microplate
reader.
◦ Record the optical density (OD) readings for all samples,
standards, and controls.
C. Post-Analytical Phase
1. Data Interpretation
◦ Calculate the concentration of Anti-SSB antibodies using the
standard curve.
◦ Determine the positivity or negativity based on the cut-off
value provided by the ELISA kit.
2. Quality Control
◦ Review the results of internal quality controls (positive and
negative controls) to ensure they are within the expected
range.
◦ If controls fall outside the expected range, repeat the assay.
3. Reporting Results
◦ Enter the results into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS) ensuring accuracy and completeness.
◦ Review and verify all results before release.
◦ Report critical results as per the laboratory’s critical values
protocol.
4. RESULTS REPORTING
Refer to site-specific reporting guidelines. Ensure all results are
reviewed and validated by a qualified technologist before reporting to
the clinician.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
As determined by the ELISA kit manufacturer and validated by the
laboratory.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the product insert of the specific ELISA kit for limitations
regarding sensitivity, specificity, and potential interferences.
1. REFERENCES
Include the ELISA kit product insert and any additional relevant
literature regarding Anti-SSB Antibody testing.
Note: This SOP should be reviewed and approved by the
laboratory’s quality assurance team and updated as necessary to
reflect the most current practices and manufacturer guidelines.
