SOP for Generating Results for ANTI-SYNTHETASE PROFILE
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this document is to outline the
standard operating procedures (SOP) for generating results for
the Anti-Synthetase Profile in the laboratory.
2. SCOPE This SOP applies to the CLIA-certified laboratory
where the Anti-Synthetase Profile analysis will be performed. It
covers the procedures from specimen preparation, reagent
preparation, assay procedure, to result interpretation and
reporting.
3. RESPONSIBILITY It is the responsibility of the designated
laboratory personnel to perform the assay, interpret the results,
and ensure the accuracy and quality of the data obtained. It is
also their responsibility to document all steps meticulously and
to report any anomalies to the supervisor.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
◦ Preferred Specimen: Serum (3-5 mL).
◦ Unacceptable Specimen: Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric
samples; specimens collected in incorrect tubes or
improperly labeled.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
◦ Automated or manual immunoassay analyzer (e.g., ELISA
reader)
◦ Anti-Synthetase Profile assay kit (including reagent wells,
controls, calibrators)
◦ Micropipettes and tips
◦ Centrifuge
◦ Timer
◦ Disposable gloves
◦ Laboratory coat
◦ Appropriate waste containers
6. PROCEDURE A. Specimen Preparation
◦ Centrifuge the serum specimen at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes
to obtain clear, cell-free serum.
◦ Aliquot the serum into a clean microcentrifuge tube if
necessary and store at 2-8°C until analysis.
B. Reagent Preparation
◦ Thaw all reagents, controls, and calibrators at room
temperature prior to beginning the assay.
◦ Prepare reagent wells as instructed in the assay kit protocol
(typically involves adding samples, controls, and calibrators
to well plate).
C. Assay Procedure
1. Label the assay plate clearly with patient identification
numbers corresponding to each well.
2. Add specified volume of calibrators, controls, and
patient sera to designated wells.
3. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for the incubation
times and temperatures required for each step of the
assay.
4. Wash the wells as directed, typically involving several
cycles of washing and blotting to remove excess
reagents.
5. Add the conjugate solution to the wells and incubate as
per the kit instructions.
6. Wash the wells again as per instructions.
7. Add the substrate solution to the wells and incubate until
color development.
8. Stop the reaction by adding the stop solution and read
the optical density (OD) values using a plate reader at the
appropriate wavelength.
D. Result Interpretation
◦ Analyze the OD readings using the software associated
with the immunoassay analyzer.
◦ Compare sample OD values to calibrator values to obtain
antibody concentration in patient samples.
◦ Interpret results based on the reference values provided in
the assay kit insert. Positive, borderline, and negative
ranges for specific antibodies (e.g., Jo-1, PL-7, PL-12, OJ,
EJ, etc.) should be followed as stated.
E. Reporting Results
◦ Document the results accurately in the laboratory
information system (LIS).
◦ If results fall outside the reportable range or show any
inconsistency, re-run the test or contact the supervisor for
further instructions.
◦ Report critical values immediately to the ordering physician,
following established laboratory communication protocols.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Run control samples along with patient samples in each
assay batch.
◦ Record control results and verify that they fall within the
acceptable range established by the assay kit manufacturer
and the laboratory's established QC procedures.
◦ Any deviation from expected control values must be
addressed by troubleshooting and corrective actions
documented.

9. REVISIONS
◦ This SOP is subject to annual review or as needed in
response to updates or changes in guidelines and
regulations.
