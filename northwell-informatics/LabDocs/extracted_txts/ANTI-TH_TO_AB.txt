Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Generating Results for
ANTI-TH/TO AB
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the analytical phase of
generating results for ANTI-TH/TO AB (Anti-Th/To antibodies) to
ensure accurate and reproducible results.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for
performing the assay and following this SOP. It is the responsibility of
all staff to report any deviations from the procedure to a supervisor
immediately.
1. DEFINITION
ANTI-TH/TO AB: Anti-Th/To antibodies are autoantibodies often
associated with systemic sclerosis and other autoimmune diseases.
Their detection aids in the diagnosis and monitoring of these
conditions.
1. PROCEDURE
A) Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies:
• ELISA microplate reader or equivalent
• Micropipettes and tips (20 µL, 200 µL, 1000 µL)
• Wash buffer (PBS or commercial equivalent)
• ANTI-TH/TO AB ELISA kit (includes coated microplates, enzyme
conjugate, substrate solution, stop solution, and controls)
• Deionized or distilled water
• Plate shaker (optional)
• Timer
• Laboratory notebook or computerized log for data entry
B) Procedure Steps:
1. Preparation
• Set up the workspace with all necessary equipment and reagents.
• Bring all reagents, samples, and controls to room temperature
(20-25°C) before use.
• Label the microplate wells to include patient samples, positive
controls, negative controls, and blanks as indicated in the kit
insert.
• Prepare the wash buffer according to manufacturer instructions if
not using a ready-to-use solution.
1. Sample and Control Preparation
• Dilute patient serum samples and controls as per the kit
manufacturer's instructions.
1. Assay Procedure
• Pipette the required volume (usually 100 µL) of diluted samples,
positive controls, negative controls, and blanks into their
respective wells.
• Incubate the microplate at room temperature for the time specified
by the kit instructions to allow antibody binding.
• Decant the contents of the wells and wash the microplate wells
multiple times (typically 3-5 times) with the wash buffer to remove
unbound material.
• Add the enzyme conjugate to each well and incubate again for the
time specified in the kit instructions.
• After incubation, decant and wash the wells as detailed in the
previous step.
• Add the substrate solution to each well. Incubate for the time
specified by the kit to allow for color development.
• Stop the reaction by adding the stop solution to each well (usually
sulfuric acid or a similar reagent).
• Measure the absorbance at the specified wavelength (often 450
nm) using a microplate reader.
1. Results Interpretation
• Using the microplate reader, record the optical density (OD)
values for each well.
• Calculate and interpret the results according to the kit insert.
Typically, this involves comparing patient sample OD values to a
cut-off value or calibration curve.
1. Quality Control
• Include quality control sera in each assay run. Ensure that control
results fall within the acceptability ranges provided by the
manufacturer.
• Document all QC results and take corrective actions if QC results
are outside acceptable limits.
1. Reporting Results
• Enter the results in the laboratory information system (LIS) for
review.
• Interpret positive/negative/equivocal results according to the
criteria specified in the kit insert.
• Verify results and release them for clinician review.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If there is no color development or weak color development:
Check incubation times and temperatures, reagent expiration, and
proper preparation of wash buffer and conjugates.
• High background or non-specific binding: Ensure thorough
washing steps, use fresh buffers, and check for contamination.
• Inconsistent results between runs: Calibrate the pipettes, ensure
stable incubation conditions, and review operator technique.

autoimmune diseases
1. RECORD KEEPING
• Maintain detailed records of each assay run, including sample
IDs, OD readings, calculated results, and QC data.
• All deviations from this SOP or issues encountered during the
procedure must be documented and reviewed by a supervisor.
1. SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS
• Handle all biological specimens as potentially infectious. Use PPE
(gloves, lab coat, eye protection) as required.
• Dispose of all biohazard waste in accordance with the laboratory
safety protocols.
• Follow all relevant workplace health and safety regulations when
handling and disposing of chemicals.
By adhering to this SOP for the generation of results for ANTI-TH/TO
AB, we ensure the accuracy, reliability, and consistency of test
results, contributing to the effective diagnosis and management of
related autoimmune diseases.
