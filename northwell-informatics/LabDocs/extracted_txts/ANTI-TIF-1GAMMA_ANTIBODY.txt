Standard Operating Procedure
Anti-TIF-1Gamma Antibody Testing
1. PURPOSE To outline the procedure for the detection and
quantification of Anti-TIF-1Gamma Antibodies in patient serum
samples utilizing ELISA (Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay)
methodology.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for
performing the assay and documenting the results following the
guidelines outlined in this procedure. Supervisors are responsible for
ensuring adherence to protocol and addressing any deviations or
issues that arise.
2. DEFINITION Anti-TIF-1Gamma Antibodies are autoantibodies
associated with certain autoimmune conditions and neoplasms.
Detection and quantification of these antibodies can aid in diagnosis
and monitoring disease progression.
3. PROCEDURE
Specimen Requirements:
• Preferred Specimen: 5-7 mL of patient serum.
• Acceptable Specimen: Serum samples stored at 2-8°C for up to
72 hours or frozen at -20°C for long-term storage.
• Unacceptable Specimen: Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
Materials and Reagents:
• ELISA Kit for Anti-TIF-1Gamma Antibody Detection
(Manufacturer: XYZ Labs)
• Microplate reader capable of reading at 450 nm
• Calibrators and controls provided in the ELISA kit
• Pipettes and tips
• Test tubes or sample vials for serum samples
• Distilled water and wash buffer solution
Procedure:
1. Preparation:
◦ Ensure all reagents and specimens have reached room
temperature prior to use.
◦ Prepare wash buffer according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
◦ Set up the ELISA plate according to the assay layout,
including wells for calibrators, controls, and patient samples.
2. Assay Protocol:
◦ Add 100 µL of calibrators, controls, and patient serum
samples to assigned wells.
◦ Incubate the plate at 37°C for 1 hour.
◦ Wash the plate 3-5 times with the prepared wash buffer.
◦ Add 100 µL of detection antibody to each well.
◦ Incubate the plate at 37°C for 30 minutes.
◦ Wash the plate 3-5 times with the wash buffer.
◦ Add substrate solution to each well and incubate in the dark
at room temperature for 15-20 minutes.
◦ Add stop solution to each well to terminate the reaction.
◦ Read the plate at 450 nm using a microplate reader.
3. Data Analysis:
◦ Generate a standard curve using the absorbance values of
the calibrators.
◦ Calculate the concentration of Anti-TIF-1Gamma Antibodies
in patient samples based on the standard curve.
Quality Control:
• Run quality control samples (provided in the ELISA kit) with each
batch of patient samples.
• Accept results only if quality control samples fall within the
expected range.
• Document quality control results and any corrective actions taken.
Reporting Results:
• Results are reviewed and verified by the technologist.
• Report Anti-TIF-1Gamma Antibody concentrations as measured in
U/mL.
• Include reference interval values provided by the kit's
manufacturer.
• Notify the physician of any critical values as per laboratory
protocol.
Reference Intervals:
• Negative: <20 U/mL
• Positive: ≥20 U/mL
Method Limitations:
• Refer to the ELISA kit insert for specific limitations and
interference factors.
