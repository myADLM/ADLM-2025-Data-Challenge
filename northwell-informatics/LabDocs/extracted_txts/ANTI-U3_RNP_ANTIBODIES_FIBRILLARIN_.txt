Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase: ANTI-
U3 RNP ANTIBODIES (FIBRILLARIN)
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedures for the analysis
of Anti-U3 RNP Antibodies (Fibrillarin) to ensure the accurate and
consistent determination of patient autoantibody levels in clinical
specimens.
Responsibility:
All laboratory personnel responsible for handling and analyzing
specimens for Anti-U3 RNP Antibodies must adhere to this protocol to
maintain uniformity and accuracy in analytic results.
1. DEFINITION
Anti-U3 RNP Antibodies (Fibrillarin) refer to autoantibodies that target
the U3 ribonucleoprotein, associated with systemic sclerosis and
other autoimmune conditions. The detection and quantification of
these antibodies are crucial for diagnosis and monitoring.
1. SPECIMEN
Acceptable Specimens:
• Serum collected in a red-top tube or serum separator tube (SST).
• Plasma collected in an anticoagulant tube (e.g., EDTA or
Heparin).
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic or icteric specimens.
• Specimens in collection tubes inappropriate for antibody testing
(e.g., citrate).
• Specimens with insufficient volume.
Specimen Storage: Specimens must be stored at 2-8°C and tested
within 7 days. For long-term storage, freeze specimens at -20°C or
colder.
1. REAGENTS AND EQUIPMENT
• Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) Kit for Anti-U3
RNP Antibodies.
• Microplate Reader: Capable of reading absorbance at 450 nm
with reference wavelength correction (optional 620-650 nm).
• Automated or Manual Pipettes: For accurate liquid handling.
• Multichannel Pipettes: Optional for efficiency.
• Reagent Reservoirs: For multichannel pipettes.
• Distilled or Deionized Water: For reagent preparation.
• Paper Towels or Absorbent Paper: For blotting.
• Timer: For time-dependent incubation steps.
• Properly calibrated Incubators: Set at 37°C.
• Plate washer or Washing Bottles: For plate washing steps.
1. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Reagent Preparation:
◦ Prepare all reagents, controls, and specimen diluents as per
the manufacturer's instructions included in the ELISA kit.
Allow reagents to reach room temperature before use.
2. Sample Preparation:
◦ Thaw specimens if frozen and mix thoroughly before testing.
Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
◦ Dilute serum/plasma samples in sample diluent as
instructed by the kit insert (usually a 1:101 dilution).
ELISA Assay Steps:
1. Sample and Control Addition:
◦ Add the appropriate volume of diluted samples, controls,
and standards to designated wells in the microplate.
◦ Seal the plate with provided adhesive film.
2. Incubation:
◦ Incubate the plate at 37°C for the specified duration
(typically 30-60 minutes but refer to kit instructions).
3. Washing:
◦ Wash the wells thoroughly with the provided washing buffer
(typically 3-5 washes).
4. Secondary Antibody Addition:
◦ Add the secondary antibody-conjugate (e.g., HRP-
conjugated antibody) to the wells.
◦ Incubate and wash as per kit instructions.
5. Substrate Reaction:
◦ Add substrate solution to wells and incubate for the
recommended time in the dark to develop color (generally
15-30 minutes).
6. Stop Reaction:
◦ Add stop solution to halt the reaction. The color will stabilize
and is ready to measure.
Reading and Analysis:
1. Measure absorbance:
◦ Measure the optical density (OD) at 450 nm using a
microplate reader. Set a reference wavelength (620–650
nm) if applicable.
2. Results Calculation:
◦ Generate the standard curve from the OD values of the
standards.
◦ Calculate the antibody concentration in patient samples by
comparing to the standard curve.
◦ Convert obtained values from optical density to antibody
concentration (units/mL) as per kit instructions.
3. QUALITY CONTROL
• Ensure QC material (negative and positive controls) is included
in every run.
• Controls must be within the specified range for assay acceptance.
• Repeat assay if controls fall outside the expected range.
• Document all QC results as per laboratory policy.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Report results according to established guidelines.
• Annotate any findings, including positive and negative results.
• For critical or unexpected results, verify with a repeat test and
consult the supervising technologist if necessary.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Reference intervals must be established as per the guidance
provided by the ELISA kit manufacturer and corroborated through
laboratory validation studies.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to the ELISA kit manual for specific limitations impacting
assay performance such as cross-reactivity, interfering
substances, and precision metrics.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s ELISA Kit Insert and guidelines.
• Relevant peer-reviewed articles and laboratory validation studies.
1. REVISION HISTORY
• Document all changes/updates to the SOP, such as modifications
in assay techniques, reagents, or procedural steps.
