Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Antibody Identification
in Blood and Serum
1. Purpose
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedure for identifying
antibodies in blood and serum specimens using standardized
laboratory techniques. This protocol ensures accurate results, quality
control, and appropriate documentation.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of trained laboratory personnel to perform
antibody identification, ensure accuracy, and maintain proper
documentation as defined in this procedure. Supervisors are
responsible for ensuring compliance and addressing any issues that
arise.
1. Specimen Requirements and Stability
Accepted Specimens:
• Whole blood collected in EDTA anticoagulant tubes
• Serum collected in red-top or SST tubes
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens not labeled with patient identification
• Hemolyzed, clotted, or lipemic blood samples
• Specimens not transported or stored at proper temperatures
Transportation and Storage:
• Whole blood in EDTA: Store at 2–8°C and test within 72 hours; do
not freeze.
• Serum: Store at 2-8°C. Can be frozen at -20°C for longer storage.
1. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies
• Centrifuge
• Incubator (set to 37°C)
• Gel card system or tube agglutination system
• Reagent red blood cells (screening and identification panels)
• Enhancement media (e.g., LISS, PEG)
• Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS)
• Anti-human globulin (AHG) reagent
• Micropipettes and tips
• Timer
• Properly labeled logbook and temperature monitoring log
1. Procedure
A. Sample Preparation:
1. Labeling and Centrifugation:
◦ Ensure the specimen is properly labeled with patient
information.
◦ Centrifuge whole blood samples at 1000-1200 RPM for 10
minutes to separate plasma/serum. If using serum, separate
from clot.
2. Preparation and Washing of Red Blood Cells:
◦ Use reagent red blood cell panels according to
manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Wash 2-3 drops of reagent red blood cells three times with
PBS, decanting supernatant after each wash.
B. Gel Card Method:
1. Preparation:
◦ Label gel cards with patient identifier.
◦ Add 50 µL of washed reagent red blood cells to each
microtube on the gel card.
2. Addition of Patient Serum/Plasma:
◦ Add 25 µL of patient serum/plasma to each microtube using
a micropipette.
3. Incubation:
◦ Incubate the gel card at 37°C for 15 to 30 minutes
depending on the manufacturer's protocol.
4. Centrifugation and Reading:
◦ Centrifuge the gel card as per the manufacturer's
instructions.
◦ Read the results of the agglutination reactions and record
the findings.
C. Tube Method:
1. Reaction Setup:
◦ Label reaction tubes with patient identifier.
◦ Add 2 drops of enhancement media (LISS or PEG) to each
tube.
◦ Add 1 drop of reagent red blood cells to each tube.
◦ Add 2 drops of patient serum/plasma.
2. Incubation:
◦ Incubate tubes at 37°C for the appropriate time per the
enhancement media used.
3. Washing and AHG Addition:
◦ Wash tubes three times with PBS, decant supernatant
completely after each wash.
◦ Add 2 drops of AHG reagent to each washed tube.
4. Reading and Recording Results:
◦ Centrifuge tubes at 1000 RPM for 15 seconds.
◦ Gently agitate and examine for agglutination or hemolysis.
◦ Record agglutination strengths and patterns according to
laboratory policy.
5. Interpretation of Results:
A. Antibody Screening:
• Negative: No agglutination observed.
• Positive: Agglutination or hemolysis observed, proceed with
antibody identification.
B. Antibody Identification:
• Compare reaction patterns with reagent red blood cell panel
antigen profiles.
• Identify specific antibody or antibodies present in the specimen
using manufacturer-provided chart and software if available.
1. Quality Control:
2. Daily Quality Control:
◦ Perform a positive and negative control with known
antibody/antigen before testing patient samples.
◦ Document quality control results in the QC log.
3. Reagent Control:
◦ Ensure all reagents are within expiry date and properly
stored.
◦ Verify performance of new reagent lots with known samples
before using for patient testing.
4. Reporting Results:
A. Documentation:
• Record all results in the laboratory information system (LIS) or
patient log.
• Include details such as reaction strengths and patterns.
B. Critical Values:
• Immediately report positive antibody identifications, especially
those clinically significant (e.g., anti-D, anti-K) to the attending
physician or healthcare provider.
• Follow standard protocol for documenting critical result
notification.
1. References:
• Manufacturer's instructions for each reagent and equipment.
• AABB Technical Manual, latest edition.
• CLSI Guidelines for antibody identification techniques in
immunohematology.
This protocol ensures thoroughness and consistency in the analytical
phase of antibody identification in the laboratory setting.
