Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Antibody Screen,
Blood
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedure for performing an
antibody screen on patient blood samples to detect any unexpected
antibodies that may be reactive with red cell antigens. This protocol
ensures accuracy, consistency, and compliance with regulatory
standards.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel who are trained and
authorized to perform antibody screening using the specified
equipment and reagents.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all laboratory personnel to adhere to this
SOP while performing antibody screens. Supervisors must ensure
staff is trained and compliant with these procedures.
4. DEFINITIONS
• Antibody Screen: A test performed to detect the presence of
unexpected antibodies in a blood sample.
• Reagent Red Cells: Standardized red blood cell suspensions
used in testing.
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type:
◦ Preferred: EDTA anticoagulated whole blood sample.
◦ Acceptable: Serum samples if EDTA plasma is not available.
• Specimen Volume:
◦ Minimum volume: 3 mL
6. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes
• Test tubes (12 x 75 mm)
• Anti-Human Globulin (AHG) reagent
• Reagent Red Cells (screening cells)
• Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS) or equivalent
• Coombs Control Cells
• Incubator set at 37°C
• Timer
• Gel card technology (if applicable, e.g., Ortho BioVue, Bio-Rad
ID-MTS Gel Test)
• Positive and negative antibody controls
7. PROCEDURE
7a. Preparing the Sample
1. Verify patient specimen and requisition form for proper
identification and labeling.
2. If the specimen has been refrigerated, bring it to room
temperature before testing.
7b. Initial Setup
1. Label test tubes with patient identification.
2. Prepare a 2-5% suspension of reagent red cells in saline if not
using pre-prepared screening cells.
3. Set up control tubes (one for positive control and one for
negative control).
7c. Incubation and Centrifugation (Tube Method)
1. Add 2 drops of patient serum or plasma to each of three test
tubes containing reagent red cells (Screening Cell I, II, and III).
2. Add 2 drops of reagent red cells to each tube.
3. Gently mix the contents of each tube.
4. Incubate the tubes at 37°C for 15-30 minutes.
5. After incubation, add 2 drops of AHG reagent to each tube
without washing (gel card technology) or proceed with washing
steps if using traditional tube method.
6. If using traditional tube method, wash cells with PBS or
appropriate washing solution 3-4 times to remove unbound
antibodies.
7. Centrifuge tubes at the recommended speed and time specified
by the AHG reagent’s manufacturer.
7d. Reading and Interpretation
1. Read the test results for agglutination or hemolysis:
◦ Agglutination indicates the presence of antibodies.
◦ No agglutination (negative result) indicates the absence of
antibodies.
2. Record results in the laboratory information system (LIS).
7e. Quality Control
1. Run positive and negative controls with each batch of patient
tests.
2. Verify that control results are as expected before accepting
patient test results.
3. Document all control results in the designated QC log.
7f. Post-Analytical Phase
1. Review and verify results.
2. Report results according to site-specific guidelines.
3. Document any discrepancies, corrective actions, and
notifications to the appropriate medical staff.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• False positives or negatives can occur due to improper washing,
expired reagents, or improper incubation times.
• The presence of certain medications or disease states may
interfere with the test results.
