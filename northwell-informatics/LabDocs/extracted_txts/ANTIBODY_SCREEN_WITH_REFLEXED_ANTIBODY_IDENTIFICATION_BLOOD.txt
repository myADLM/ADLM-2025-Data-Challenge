STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP) ANTIBODY
SCREEN WITH REFLEXED ANTIBODY IDENTIFICATION, BLOOD
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to outline the steps taken to perform
an antibody screen with reflexed antibody identification for blood
samples. The antibody screen detects the presence of antibodies in a
patient's plasma that could react with red blood cell antigens. If the
screen is positive, antibody identification is performed to determine
the specificity of the antibody. This helps in preventing hemolytic
transfusion reactions and in managing hemolytic diseases of the
newborn.
1. SCOPE
This protocol applies to all staff performing antibody screening and
identification in the laboratory.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of qualified laboratory technologists to perform,
review, and document all antibody screens and identifications in
accordance with this SOP.
1. DEFINITIONS
Antibody Screen: A test that detects unexpected antibodies in the
patient's plasma. Antibody Identification: A follow-up test performed to
identify the specificity of an antibody detected in the antibody screen.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/Acceptable Specimen:
• 5 mL of whole blood collected in an EDTA lavender-top tube.
• Properly labeled with patient’s full name, ID number or medical
record number, date and time of collection.
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Hemolyzed samples.
• Unlabeled or mislabeled samples.
• Specimens collected in anticoagulants other than EDTA or
exhibiting clot formation.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Automated Blood Bank Analyzer (e.g., Ortho Vision, Galileo
Echo).
• Reagent red blood cell panels.
• Antiglobulin reagent (AHG).
• EDTA tubes.
• Centrifuge.
• Pipettes.
• Incubator set at 37°C.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Antibody Screen
1. Ensure specimen is properly labeled and meets acceptance
criteria.
2. Centrifuge specimen to separate plasma.
3. Load specimen and reagents into the automated blood bank
analyzer.
4. Follow the instrument's operational protocol to perform the
antibody screen, including:
◦ Adding patient plasma to reagent red cell panels.
◦ Incubating at 37°C as per instrument instructions.
◦ Washing cells and adding AHG reagent.
◦ Centrifuging and checking for agglutination.
5. Record the results. Negative screening indicates no further
testing required. Positive results trigger antibody identification.
B. Reflexed Antibody Identification
1. Using the same plasma specimen, perform antibody
identification following positive antibody screen results.
2. Select an identification panel of reagent red cells.
3. Mix specific panel cells with patient’s plasma based on antibody
screen results.
4. Incubate the mixture at 37°C for the specified time.
5. Wash cells thoroughly and add AHG reagent.
6. Centrifuge and observe for agglutination.
7. Document the strength of the reaction and patterns of reactivity.
8. Compare reaction patterns against the reference chart to
identify specific antibody.
9. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run quality control samples daily to check the reactivity of each
reagent used in the antibody screen and identification process.
• Calibrate and maintain the automated blood bank analyzer
regularly as per manufacturer’s recommendations.
• Ensure all results are reviewed and verified by a qualified
technologist before reporting.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Negative antibody screen results are documented and reported
directly.
• Positive antibody screen followed by antibody identification results
are documented, and specific antibody identified is reported.
• Critical findings, such as newly identified antibodies or those
associated with hemolytic transfusion reactions, must be promptly
communicated to the ordering physician or relevant medical
personnel.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Antibody Screen: Negative
• Antibody Identification: Presence and specificity of antibody
identified.
1. LIMITATIONS
• False-negative results may occur if the antibody titer is too low.
• Interference from hemolysis or other specimen quality issues can
affect test outcomes.
• Heterogeneity in antigen expression of reagent red cells may
impact results.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions for use of automated blood bank
analyzers.
• Current guidelines from the American Association of Blood Banks
(AABB).
• Laboratory quality control and procedure manuals.
By following this SOP, laboratory personnel can ensure accurate and
reliable results for antibody screening and identification, critical for
safe transfusion practices and patient care.
