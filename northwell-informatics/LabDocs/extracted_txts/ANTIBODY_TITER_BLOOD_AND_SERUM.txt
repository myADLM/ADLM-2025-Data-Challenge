STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP)
Protocol for Analytical Phase of Generating Results for Antibody
Titer, Blood and Serum
1. Purpose
To establish a standardized procedure for the analytical phase of
generating results for antibody titer in blood and serum samples to
ensure accuracy, reproducibility, and reliability of test results.
Responsibility:
The designated laboratory staff is responsible for performing and
documenting the antibody titer test as outlined in this SOP. All staff
members are responsible for ensuring adherence to these
procedures and reporting any deviations or issues to a supervisor.
2. Definition
Antibody titer: A laboratory test used to determine the concentration
of antibodies in a blood or serum sample.
3. Specimen Requirements
Specimen Collection:
• Preferred specimen: Venous blood collected in a red-top tube or
serum separator tube (SST).
• Acceptable specimen: Serum derived from clotted whole blood
within specified timeframes.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
• Specimens without proper labeling (collection date/time or patient
identification).
• Specimens received more than 24 hours after collection without
proper preservation.
4. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies
• Centrifuge
• Micro-pipettes and tips
• Vortex mixer
• Tube racks
• Calibrated dilution pipettes
• Antibody-specific reagent kits (e.g., ELISA kits)
• Incubator
• Plate reader (spectrophotometer)
• Laboratory freezer (-20°C to -80°C)
• Laboratory refrigerator (2-8°C)
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
5. Procedure
A. Sample Preparation
1. Centrifuge Blood Collection Tubes:
◦ Centrifuge collected blood samples at 3000 RPM for 10
minutes to separate serum.
◦ Carefully transfer the serum to a clean, appropriately
labeled microtube.
2. Storage of Serum:
◦ Store serum samples at 2-8°C for short-term storage (up to
24 hours).
◦ For long-term storage, aliquot serum into smaller volumes
and store at -20°C to -80°C.
B. Assay Preparation
1. Preparation of Reagents:
◦ Follow manufacturer's instructions for preparing reagents for
the antibody-specific assay kit.
2. Calibration and Verification:
◦ Perform calibration and verification of the plate reader and
incubator prior to use.
◦ Run controls and standards provided in the assay kit to
verify performance.
C. Assay Procedure
1. Sample Dilution:
◦ Prepare serial dilutions of serum samples in appropriate
buffer as specified in the kit protocol.
2. Plate Setup:
◦ Add diluted serum samples, controls, and standards to the
designated wells of the assay plate.
3. Incubation:
◦ Incubate the plate at the specified temperature and time as
per the kit instructions.
4. Wash Steps:
◦ Perform wash steps using the automated plate washer or
manually as required.
5. Addition of Detection Reagent:
◦ Add detection reagent to each well and follow subsequent
incubation steps as outlined in the kit protocol.
6. Substrate Addition:
◦ Add substrate to each well and allow the color development
as specified in the kit instructions.
7. Reading the Plate:
◦ Read the plate using a calibrated plate reader and record
absorbance values at the specified wavelength.
8. Calculation of Results:
◦ Calculate antibody titers using the manufacturer's software
or manual methods as outlined in the kit protocol.
D. Quality Control
1. QC Materials:
◦ Utilize control materials such as positive and negative
controls as specified in the assay kit.
◦ Run QC samples with each batch of tests undertaken.
2. Documentation:
◦ Document all calibration, QC, and patient results in
appropriate logbooks and laboratory information systems
(LIS).
E. Reporting of Results
1. Review and Verification:
◦ Technologist reviews and verifies results before reporting.
◦ Any discrepancies or issues are to be addressed before
final verification.
2. Interpretation:
◦ Interpret results according to reference intervals and clinical
guidelines provided by assay kit manufacturer.
3. Transmission of Results:
◦ Results are entered into the LIS and verified before final
transmission to the requesting physician or clinical
department.
6. Method Limitations
Refer to the specific antibody assay kit insert for limitations related to
reagent sensitivity, specificity, and potential interference in the assay.
