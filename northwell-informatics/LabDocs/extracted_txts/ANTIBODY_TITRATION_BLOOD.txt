Standard Operating Procedure
(SOP) for Antibody Titration in
Blood
1. PURPOSE:
To ensure accurate and reliable results in the titration of antibodies in
blood samples through standardized procedures.
2. SCOPE:
This SOP applies to all staff members conducting antibody titration
testing in a CLIA-certified laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY:
• All qualified laboratory personnel are responsible for performing
and documenting antibody titration procedures accurately.
• The supervisor is responsible for reviewing and approving results
and ensuring adherence to SOPs.
4. DEFINITIONS:
Antibody Titration: A semi-quantitative method to determine the
strength or concentration of specific antibodies in a blood sample.
5. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES:
• Centrifuge
• Serological pipettes
• Micropipettes
• Test tubes and rack
• Incubator
• Reagent red cells
• Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)
• Anti-human globulin (AHG) reagent
• Microscope
• Anti-IgG and/or Anti-C3d if needed
• Graduated cylinders and beakers
• Quality control material
• Blood samples
6. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS:
• Specimen Collection: Blood must be collected in EDTA
anticoagulated tubes.
• Specimen Storage: Samples must be stored at 2-8°C until
testing. Testing should preferably be performed within 72 hours of
collection.
• Specimen Integrity: Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples may
interfere with results and should be avoided.
7. PROCEDURE:
Step 1: Preparation of Serial Dilutions
1. Label a set of test tubes 1 through 10.
2. Add 1 mL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to each test tube.
3. Add 1 mL of serum or plasma to tube 1 and mix well.
4. Transfer 1 mL from tube 1 to tube 2, mix well, and continue this
serial dilution process through tube 10, discarding 1 mL from
the last tube.
Step 2: Adding Reagent Red Cells
1. Add 1 drop of 2-5% suspension of reagent red cells
(corresponding to the specificity of the antibody being titrated)
to each tube.
2. Mix well.
Step 3: Incubation
1. Incubate the tubes at 37°C for 15-30 minutes, as specific for the
types of antibodies being titrated.
2. Centrifuge the tubes at 1000 rpm for 1 minute.
Step 4: Reading Agglutination
1. Gently shake each tube to resuspend the cells and read the
agglutination reaction visually or under a microscope, if
necessary.
2. Record the results for each dilution.
◦ Grade agglutination reaction using a scale (e.g., 4+, 3+, 2+,
1+, and 0).
Step 5: Anti-Human Globulin (AHG) Testing (if required)
1. Wash the cells in each tube three times with PBS.
2. Add 2 drops of AHG reagent to each tube.
3. Mix well and centrifuge the tubes at 1000 rpm for 1 minute.
4. Resuspend the cells and read the agglutination reactions.
5. Record the results.
8. QUALITY CONTROL:
• Include positive and negative controls in each run.
• Use QC sera to ensure the reliability of the test.
• Document all QC results and take appropriate corrective actions if
control results fall outside acceptable limits.
9. REPORTING RESULTS:
• Titer results are reported as the reciprocal of the highest serum
dilution that produces 1+ agglutination.
• Example: if a 1:64 dilution is the last tube to show 1+
agglutination, report the titer as 64.
• All results should be reviewed and verified by the supervising
technologist before final reporting.
10. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS:
• Results must be interpreted in conjunction with patient history and
clinical findings.
• Variations in titer levels should be evaluated cautiously and
correlated with potential clinical implications.
11. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
• Discrepancies in manual technique can affect the accuracy of
results.
• Hemolyzed or contaminated samples may yield false results.
• Specific antibodies may require tailored procedures for best
results.
12. REFERENCES:
• Standardized guidelines from AABB (American Association of
Blood Banks) for antibody titration.
• Manufacturer's instructions for use of specific reagents and
equipment.
• Relevant clinical laboratory standards documentation.
13. DOCUMENTATION:
• Maintain records of each test performed including specimen
identification, results, QC, and any corrective actions taken.
• Retain documentation as per laboratory policy and regulatory
requirements.
