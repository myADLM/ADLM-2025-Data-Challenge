Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Antibody to Extractable
Nuclear Antigen Evaluation, Serum
1. PURPOSE
This procedure provides guidelines for the analysis of Antibodies to
Extractable Nuclear Antigen (ENA) in serum samples using an
automated immunoassay system. The goal is to ensure accurate and
reliable detection and quantification of specific autoantibodies related
to connective tissue diseases.
Responsibility:
The laboratory technologist is responsible for performing the analysis
as outlined in this procedure. It is the responsibility of the laboratory
supervisor to ensure that all personnel are trained and competent in
performing the procedure.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
◦ Preferred specimen: 5 mL of serum separated from whole
blood collected in a red-top or serum separator tube (SST).
◦ Stability: Serum samples should be stored at 2-8°C and
tested within 7 days. For long-term storage, samples should
be frozen at -20°C or lower.
2. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
◦ Automated immunoassay analyzer (e.g., ELISA,
Chemiluminescent Immunoassay)
◦ Calibrators
◦ Controls (low, medium, and high)
◦ ENA assay reagents and consumables
◦ Disposable pipettes and tips
◦ Sample tubes
◦ Personal protective equipment (PPE)
3. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation
◦ Ensure all reagents, controls, and calibrators are at room
temperature before use.
◦ Verify that the instrument has been calibrated and is
operating correctly. Perform any required maintenance or
QC checks according to the manufacturer's guidelines.
B) Sample Handling
◦ Label sample tubes clearly with patient identification.
◦ Allow the serum samples to reach room temperature before
analysis.
C) Running the Assay
1. Load samples, calibrators, and controls into the
designated positions on the analyzer.
2. Program the analyzer according to the manufacturer's
instructions, including selecting the appropriate ENA
assay protocol.
3. Verify that the correct volumes of serum, reagents, and
diluents are loaded as instructed by the manufacturer.
4. Start the assay run.
5. Monitor the run for any issues or alerts indicated by the
analyzer.
D) Results Evaluation
◦ Review the raw data generated by the automated system.
◦ Verify that the calibration and control results fall within the
acceptable ranges before interpretation of patient results.
◦ Evaluate patient results in the context of the control samples
to ensure reliability.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Run quality control samples in each assay batch (low,
medium, and high controls).
◦ Ensure that control results are within the established
ranges. If control results are outside the acceptable limits,
troubleshoot according to manufacturer guidelines and
repeat the assay if necessary.
◦ Document all quality control results in the laboratory log.
5. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ Report results according to the established laboratory
reporting protocol.
◦ Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
promptly and accurately, and ensure all anomalies or
discrepancies are resolved before final verification.
◦ Refer to site-specific guidelines for critical values and result
interpretation.
6. REFERENCE INTERVALS AND INTERPRETATION
◦ Reference intervals will be established by the laboratory
based on manufacturer recommendations and clinical
validation.
◦ Results may be reported as positive or negative, and if
quantitative, values will be given in the appropriate units
(e.g., IU/mL).
7. TROUBLESHOOTING
◦ Follow the manufacturer’s troubleshooting guide for issues
arising during the assay run.
◦ Common problems include equipment alerts, calibration
failures, and control failures. Address each issue
systematically and document all corrective actions taken.
8. MAINTENANCE
◦ Perform daily, weekly, and monthly maintenance as
specified by the analyzer manufacturer.
◦ Log all maintenance activities in the equipment maintenance
log.
