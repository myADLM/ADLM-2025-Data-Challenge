Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase:
Antidepressant Drug Screen, Qualitative
1. PURPOSE
This procedure outlines the steps necessary for the qualitative
screening of antidepressant drugs in biological specimens. The
purpose of this test is to identify the presence of commonly
prescribed antidepressants to assist in clinical decision-making.
Responsibility:
• It is the responsibility of the laboratory technologists and analysts
to perform the antidepressant drug screen according to this SOP.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring that the technologists
are trained and proficient in the execution of this procedure.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND HANDLING
• Preferred Specimen:
◦ Urine, 10 mL, collected in a clean, dry container without
preservatives.
◦ Blood, 3 mL, collected in serum separator tubes (SST) or
heparinized tubes. Serum or plasma.
• Unacceptable Specimen:
◦ Specimens with excessive hemolysis or lipemia for blood
samples.
◦ Specimens not labeled or improperly labeled.
◦ Specimens stored beyond recommended stability (urine > 5
days refrigerated).
• Specimen Storage:
◦ Store urine specimens at 2-8°C if they will not be analyzed
within 24 hours.
◦ Store blood specimens at 2-8°C and separate serum/plasma
within 2 hours of collection if not analyzed immediately.
3. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Immunoassay Analyzer or Chromatography System
• Calibrators and Controls specific for antidepressants
• Centrifuge (for blood specimens)
• Pipettes and tips
• Urine containers and blood collection tubes (SST or heparinized)
• Quality control materials including negative and positive controls
4. PROCEDURE
Sample Preparation:
• Urine Specimens:
◦ Mix urine specimen well before testing.
◦ No additional preparation needed unless dilution is specified in
assay protocol.
• Blood Specimens:
◦ After centrifugation, separate serum or plasma from cells
immediately.
◦ Ensure sample is free of particulates and hemolysis unless
otherwise indicated.
Immunoassay Method:
A) Calibration and Quality Control:
1. Perform calibration using calibrators provided by the assay
manufacturer.
2. Run quality control samples at the beginning of each batch or
analytical run.
3. Ensure that both negative and positive control results fall within
the accepted range before proceeding with patient sample
analysis.
B) Running the Assay:
1. Label test tubes or wells appropriately for each patient sample,
calibrator, and control.
2. Add the specified volume of calibrator, control, and patient
sample to the designated test tubes or wells.
3. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for the addition of
reagents, incubation periods, and wash steps specific to the
assay being used.
4. Load the prepared test tubes or wells into the immunoassay
analyzer or chromatography system.
5. Initiate the assay run according to instrument protocol.
Chromatography Method:
A) Preparation of Reagents:
1. Prepare mobile phases and other reagents as per the
manufacturer's protocol.
2. Prepare calibration standards and quality control samples at
specified concentration levels.
B) Sample Injection:
1. Inject calibrators, quality controls, and patient samples in the
specified volume using an auto-injector or manual injection.
2. Follow the instrument protocol for chromatographic separation
and detection of antidepressants.
5. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
• Antidepressant drug presence is determined based on
comparison with calibrated control samples.
• Results are reported qualitatively as 'Positive' or 'Negative' based
on the assay cutoff values set by the manufacturer.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results should be documented in the laboratory information
system (LIS).
• Verify and ensure all positive results are reviewed and confirmed
by a supervisory technologist before reporting.
• For any discrepancies or unusual findings, repeat the analysis or
confirm using an alternative method if necessary.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform calibration and run quality controls as outlined for each
batch.
• Document all quality control data in the appropriate QC log.
• Investigate any out-of-range quality control results and take
corrective action as needed.
8. LIMITATIONS AND INTERFERENCES
• Refer to the assay-specific insert for information on potential
interfering substances.
• Cross-reactivity with other medications or substances may lead to
false positives or negatives; confirmatory testing is recommended
for positive results.

10. REVIEW AND DOCUMENTATION
• This SOP should be reviewed annually or as needed with any
changes highlighted and communicated to laboratory personnel.
• Appropriate signatures and dates for review should be recorded.
