Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Antidepressant Drug Screen, Urine,
Quantitative
Department: Chemistry/Biochemistry Laboratory
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedures for the quantitative analysis of urine
samples for the presence of antidepressant drugs. This method
ensures the accurate and reproducible measurement of
antidepressants for clinical diagnostic purposes.
Responsibility: Designated staff members with training in analytical
chemistry and biochemistry techniques will perform and document all
analytical procedures related to this test. Staff and supervisors must
ensure adherence to protocols and corrective actions when required.
1. DEFINITION
Antidepressant drugs include various pharmacological compounds
such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), tricyclic
antidepressants (TCAs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), and
other similar classes of drugs commonly used to treat major
depressive disorders.
1. PROCEDURE
Specimen Requirements:
• Preferred: 10 mL of fresh urine, collected in a sterile container
without preservatives.
• Unacceptable: Specimens arriving more than 24 hours after
collection without refrigeration, those with visible contamination,
or those not properly labeled.
Equipment and Reagents:
• High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) system with
UV detector
• Calibrated pipettes and volumetric flasks
• Standard solutions of antidepressants (calibrators and controls)
• Extraction solvents (e.g., methanol, acetonitrile)
• Mobile phase solvents (e.g., water, acetonitrile with 0.1% formic
acid)
• Syringe filters (0.22 µm)
• HPLC columns (C18 or equivalent)
Sample Preparation:
a. Urine Sample Processing:
• Mix urine samples thoroughly.
• Aliquot 5 mL of the urine sample into a clean centrifuge tube.
• Centrifuge at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes to separate particulate
matter.
• Transfer the supernatant to a clean tube.
b. Solid-Phase Extraction (SPE):
• Precondition SPE cartridges with methanol followed by water.
• Load 2 mL of the urine supernatant onto the SPE cartridge.
• Wash the cartridge with water followed by 5% methanol in water.
• Elute antidepressants with methanol into a clean tube.
c. Sample Derivatization (if necessary): Perform derivatization
according to the specific antidepressant requirements, following the
manufacturer’s instructions on the reagent used for derivatization.
HPLC Analysis:
a. HPLC System Setup:
• Install and equilibrate the HPLC column with the mobile phase.
• Set the column temperature to 25°C.
• Set the flow rate to 1.0 mL/min.
b. Injection:
• Filter the extracted urine sample with a 0.22 µm syringe filter.
• Transfer the filtered sample into HPLC vials.
• Inject 10 µL of the sample into the HPLC system.
c. Detection and Data Analysis:
• Set the UV detector to the appropriate wavelength (e.g., 254 nm).
• Analyze the chromatogram to identify and quantify the
antidepressant peaks using appropriate software.
• Compare the retention times and peak areas of the samples with
those of the standard calibrators.
Calibration and Quality Control:
a. Calibration Curve:
• Prepare a calibration curve using standard solutions with known
concentrations of antidepressants.
• Run calibration standards at the beginning and end of each batch
of samples.
b. Quality Control:
• Include at least two levels of quality control samples (e.g., low and
high concentration) in each analytical batch.
• Acceptable ranges for QC samples must be established and
adhered to.
Reporting Results:
• Quantitative results are reviewed and verified by a qualified
technologist.
• Ensure all results are within the calibration range. If results are
outside the calibration range, dilute the sample and reanalyze or
identify as outside assay range with appropriate comments.
• Report results through the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
according to site-specific reporting guidelines.
• Ensure proper documentation of any deviations, corrective
actions, and instrument maintenance activities.
Reference Intervals:
• Results should be compared against therapeutic reference ranges
and, if necessary, confirm the interpretation of results with the
clinician, considering patient-specific information.
Method Limitations:
• Interference from other substances, sensitivity, limit of detection,
and specificity must be noted.
• Refer to the instrument and reagent manufacturers' inserts for
additional information on limitations.

• Instrument and reagent manufacturers' manuals
• Current clinical and laboratory guidelines for the use of HPLC in
clinical toxicology.
