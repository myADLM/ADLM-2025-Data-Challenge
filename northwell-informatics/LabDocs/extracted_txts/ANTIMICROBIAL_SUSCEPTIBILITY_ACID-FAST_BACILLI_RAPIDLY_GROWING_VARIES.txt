Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Antimicrobial
Susceptibility Testing of Rapidly Growing Acid-Fast Bacilli (AFB)
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for determining the antimicrobial
susceptibility of rapidly growing acid-fast bacilli (AFB), ensuring
accurate and reliable results for optimal patient care.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the laboratory technologists to perform
antimicrobial susceptibility tests accurately and to report the results
promptly. Supervisors are responsible for verifying results and
ensuring adherence to the SOP.
3. DEFINITION
Rapidly growing acid-fast bacilli (AFB) include species such as
Mycobacterium fortuitum, Mycobacterium chelonae, and
Mycobacterium abscessus. These organisms can grow within 7 days
on appropriate media under suitable conditions.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type: Clinical isolates of rapid-growing acid-fast bacilli.
Specimen Collection: Isolates should be obtained from clinical
specimens, cultured and confirmed as rapidly growing AFB.
Specimen Storage: Store clinical isolates at -70°C until testing.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Middlebrook 7H10 or 7H11 agar plates
• BACTEC MGIT 960 system
• Mueller-Hinton broth
• MacFarland 0.5 Standard
• Antimicrobial disks or E-test strips
• Incubator set at 35-37°C
• Inoculation loops and sterile pipettes
• Petri dishes and sterile test tubes
6. PROCEDURE
A) Inoculum Preparation
1. Using a sterile loop, pick 3-5 well-isolated colonies from an
actively growing culture.
2. Emulsify the colonies in 2 mL of sterile saline to achieve a
turbidity equivalent to a 0.5 McFarland standard.
3. Vortex the suspension to ensure even distribution of the
organisms.
B) Preparing the Agar Plate
1. Label agar plates with the organism's identification number,
date, and antimicrobials to be tested.
2. Using a sterile swab, dip into the suspension and streak the
entire surface of the agar plate, ensuring even distribution.
C) Disk Diffusion Method
1. Once the surface of the agar plate is dry, place antimicrobial
disks equidistantly on the agar surface using sterile forceps.
2. Press each disk down to ensure complete contact with the agar.
3. Incubate the plates inverted at 35-37°C for 48-72 hours in a
non-CO2 incubator.
D) E-test Method
1. Using the prepared suspension, inoculate the agar surface and
spread evenly.
2. Place E-test strips on the inoculated agar surface using sterile
forceps, ensuring complete contact.
3. Incubate the plates at 35-37°C for 48-72 hours.
E) Reading and Interpreting Results
1. Measure the diameter of the zones of inhibition (for disk
diffusion) or read the point where the inhibition ellipse intersects
the scale on the E-test strip.
2. Interpret the results according to the Clinical and Laboratory
Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines.
F) Quality Control Measures
1. Include control strains, such as Mycobacterium peregrinum
ATCC 700686, to ensure the accuracy of the testing system.
2. Record all quality control results and verify against established
acceptance criteria.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Document the antimicrobial susceptibility results in the
laboratory information system (LIS).
2. Results must be reviewed and verified by senior technologists
or supervisors before releasing reports to the requesting
healthcare provider.
8. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Refer to CLSI guidelines for specific interpretation criteria for
susceptible, intermediate, and resistant results.
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Results should be correlated with clinical and other microbiological
data. False susceptibility or resistance may occur due to technical
errors or mixed cultures.

11. DOCUMENTATION
All results, quality control records, and equipment maintenance
documentation must be maintained and reviewed regularly to ensure
compliance with regulatory and accreditation requirements.
12. SAFETY PRECAUTIONS
Follow all biosafety guidelines for handling Mycobacterium species,
including the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) and
working within a biosafety cabinet.

susceptibility testing of rapidly growing AFB, ensuring accurate and
reliable results for optimal patient care.
