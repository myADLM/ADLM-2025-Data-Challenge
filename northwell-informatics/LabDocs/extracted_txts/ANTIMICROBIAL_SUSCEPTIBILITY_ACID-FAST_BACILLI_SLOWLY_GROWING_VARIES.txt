STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP) FOR
ANTIMICROBIAL SUSCEPTIBILITY TESTING OF ACID-FAST
BACILLI - SLOWLY GROWING
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for determining the antimicrobial
susceptibility of acid-fast bacilli (AFB), specifically slowly growing
mycobacteria. This SOP ensures accurate and reliable results to
guide appropriate antimicrobial therapy for patients.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of designated laboratory personnel to perform
antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) on clinical isolates of slowly
growing mycobacteria according to this SOP. Laboratory staff must
ensure accurate documentation and timely communication of results.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
◦ Acceptable Specimens:
▪ Clinical isolates of slowly growing AFB from primary
culture.
▪ Specimens may include sputum, body fluids, tissue, or
any other clinical sample collected for AFB culture.
◦ Unacceptable Specimens:
▪ Specimens not properly labeled with patient
identification.
▪ Specimens older than 7 days from initial collection
without proper storage.
2. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
◦ Biological safety cabinet (Class II)
◦ Incubator set at 37°C
◦ Broth microdilution plates or other testing platforms
validated for mycobacterial AST
◦ Sterile loops and pipettes
◦ Reagent-grade water
◦ Sterile saline or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)
◦ Antimicrobial agents/discs as per recognized guidelines
(e.g., CLSI)
◦ Quality control strains (e.g., Mycobacterium tuberculosis
H37Rv or drug-resistant strains)
◦ Automated reader if applicable
◦ Petri dishes or tissue culture plates for Mycobacterium
Growth Indicator Tube (MGIT) systems
3. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation of Inoculum
1. Harvest colonies from a solid medium culture (e.g., Lowenstein-Jensen, Middlebrook 7H11) using a sterile loop.
2. Suspend the colonies in sterile saline or PBS to achieve a turbidity equivalent to a 0.5 McFarland Standard (~1-1.5 x 10^8 CFU/mL), verified visually or using a turbidity meter.
3. Mix the suspension thoroughly to obtain a homogenous solution.
B) Inoculation
1. Using a calibrated pipette, inoculate the prepared suspension into the broth microdilution plates or MGIT systems.
2. Add antimicrobial agents to wells or tubes as per manufacturer’s instructions and CLSI guidelines.
3. Ensure all inoculated plates or tubes are processed in a biological safety cabinet to maintain sterility and biohazard containment.
C) Incubation
1. Place inoculated plates or tubes in an incubator set to 37°C.
2. Incubate for the recommended period, which may range from 7 to 14 days depending on the specific type of mycobacterium and testing system.
D) Reading Results
1. Assess growth visually or using an automated reader. Growth is indicated by turbidity or fluorescence signal, depending on the system.
2. Determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) or interpret results based on established breakpoint values.
3. Record results as ‘susceptible, intermediate, or resistant’ based on the MIC or growth in the presence of antimicrobials.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Include quality control strains in each batch of testing to
verify the accuracy and reliability of the results.
2. QC strains should produce known results for each
antimicrobial agent tested.
3. Record and analyze QC results as part of regular quality
assurance practices. Deviations should prompt an
investigation and resolution.
2. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
or appropriate database.
2. Verify the results ensuring all parameters are met before
final reporting.
3. Communicate critical findings to the attending clinician
promptly.
3. REFERENCE INTERVALS AND INTERPRETIVE CRITERIA
◦ Refer to the latest CLSI guidelines or internal hospital
guidelines for interpretive criteria specific to the
antimicrobials tested.
4. SAFETY AND BIOHAZARD CONSIDERATIONS
◦ Always work within a biological safety cabinet when
handling cultures.
◦ Dispose of biohazardous waste in accordance with
institutional and federal regulations.
◦ Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE)
including gloves, lab coat, and eye protection.
