SOP: Analytical Phase for Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing on
Aerobic Bacteria
1. PURPOSE
To describe the standardized procedure for performing antimicrobial
susceptibility testing on aerobic bacteria in order to determine the
effectiveness of antibiotics and guide appropriate therapeutic
treatment.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of the designated staff members to perform
antimicrobial susceptibility testing as per this protocol. Supervisors
must ensure that all staff members are trained and competent in
performing the procedure accurately.
1. DEFINITION
Antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) assesses the sensitivity of
bacteria to a range of antimicrobial drugs. This testing helps in
identifying effective agents for treatment of infections caused by
aerobic bacteria.
1. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation and Quality Control
1. Ensure all required materials and equipment are on hand,
including:
◦ Mueller-Hinton agar plates
◦ Antimicrobial susceptibility disks or E-test strips
◦ Incubator set at 35-37°C
◦ McFarland standard (0.5)
◦ Sterile swabs
◦ Forceps
◦ Sterile loop
2. Calibrate and validate the equipment regularly, recording the
calibration dates and any maintenance performed.
3. Perform quality control tests with known control strains (e.g.,
ATCC strains) and document results. Control tests must fall
within the established acceptable range before proceeding with
patient samples.
B) Inoculum Preparation
1. Using aseptic techniques, emulsify a few isolated colonies from
the pure culture of bacteria from an overnight grown agar plate
into sterile saline to match a turbidity of 0.5 McFarland
standard.
2. Vortex the suspension to ensure uniform distribution.
C) Inoculation of Agar Plates
1. Dip a sterile swab into the bacterial suspension, then rotate the
swab against the inside of the tube to remove excess liquid.
2. Evenly spread the entire surface of a Mueller-Hinton agar plate
by streaking in three directions to ensure the complete lawn
growth of bacteria.
3. Allow the plate to dry for about 3-5 minutes with the lid in place.
D) Application of Antimicrobial Disks/E-Test Strips
1. Using sterile forceps, place the appropriate antimicrobial disks
or E-test strips onto the agar surface. Ensure the disks are
evenly distributed and are at least 24 mm apart from the center.
2. Gently press down to ensure complete contact with the agar
surface but avoid moving the disks after placement.
E) Incubation
1. Invert the plates and incubate them aerobically at 35-37°C for
16-18 hours.
2. For specific fastidious organisms, follow the appropriate special
incubation conditions as recommended (refer to CLSI
guidelines).
F) Interpretation of Results
1. After incubation, examine each plate for zones of inhibition
around the antibiotic disks or E-test strips.
2. Measure the diameter of the zones of inhibition to the nearest
millimeter using a ruler or caliper for disk diffusion. For E-test,
read the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) where the
ellipse intersects the strip.
3. Compare the measurements against the latest Clinical and
Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines to determine
bacterial susceptibility (susceptible, intermediate, or resistant).
G) Documentation and Reporting
1. Record the measurements and interpret the results using the
laboratory information system (LIS).
2. Report the susceptibility results promptly to the treating
healthcare provider or physician.
3. Quality Control and Troubleshooting
4. Regularly monitor temperature and ensure proper maintenance
of incubators.
5. Use control strains to verify the accuracy of antimicrobial
susceptibility testing.
6. If unexpected results are encountered, repeat the test and
check for any pre-analytical, analytical, or post-analytical errors.
7. Consult the supervisor for guidance in case of persistent issues
or discrepancies.
