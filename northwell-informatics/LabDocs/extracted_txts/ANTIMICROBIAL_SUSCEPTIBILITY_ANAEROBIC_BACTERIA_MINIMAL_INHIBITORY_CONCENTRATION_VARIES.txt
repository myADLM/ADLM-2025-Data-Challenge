Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Antimicrobial
Susceptibility Testing (AST): Anaerobic Bacteria, and
Determination of Minimal Inhibitory Concentration
Date: October 2023 Version: 1.0
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is to
outline the process for performing antimicrobial susceptibility testing
(AST) of anaerobic bacteria, including the determination of minimal
inhibitory concentration (MIC) using various methods. The testing will
help in determining the antibiotic sensitivity profile of bacterial
isolates to guide appropriate therapeutic options.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to clinical specimens where anaerobic bacteria are
suspected, requiring AST and MIC determination. It details the steps
from inoculation, incubation, and reading to interpretation and
reporting of results.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing AST
and MIC determinations according to this SOP.
• Laboratory supervisors are responsible for ensuring the
procedure adherence and addressing any issues that arise during
the testing process.
• It is the responsibility of all laboratory personnel to ensure that
proper documentation, quality control, and safety protocols are
followed.
4. DEFINITION
• Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (AST): Laboratory
procedures used to determine the responsiveness of bacteria to
various antibiotics.
• Minimal Inhibitory Concentration (MIC): The lowest
concentration of an antimicrobial agent required to inhibit visible
growth of a microorganism.
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
• Specimens such as wound exudates, sterile body fluids, or tissue
biopsies collected under anaerobic conditions.
• Transport specimens immediately to the laboratory in appropriate
anaerobic transport media.
6. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Anaerobic chamber or jars with gas packs
• Anaerobic culture media (e.g., CDC anaerobic blood agar,
Brucella blood agar)
• Antibiotic disks or MIC determination kits (e.g., E-test strips, broth
microdilution panels)
• Incubator, set to appropriate temperature (35-37°C)
• Sterile swabs, loops, and inoculating needles
• McFarland standard
• Vortex mixer
• Calibrated pipettes and tips
• Quality control strains (e.g., Bacteroides fragilis ATCC 25285)
7. PROCEDURE
A. Inoculum Preparation
1. Prepare a bacterial suspension equivalent to a 0.5 McFarland
standard using a fresh culture of the anaerobic isolate.
2. Vortex the suspension to achieve homogeneity.
B. Inoculation and Incubation
1. For Disk Diffusion Method: a. Use sterile swab to inoculate
Mueller-Hinton Blood Agar plates (with 5% horse blood and
vitamin K1) with the bacterial suspension, creating a lawn of
growth. b. Place antibiotic disks evenly spaced on agar
surfaces. c. Incubate plates in an anaerobic jar or chamber at
35-37°C for 48 hours.
2. For E-test Strips: a. Follow similar inoculation steps as in the
disk diffusion method. b. Place E-test strips on the surface of
inoculated plates. c. Incubate in an anaerobic environment at
35-37°C for 48 hours.
3. For Broth Microdilution: a. Inoculate microdilution trays
containing serial dilutions of antibiotics with the prepared
inoculum. b. Seal trays in anaerobic bags and incubate at
35-37°C for 48 hours.
C. Reading and Interpretation
1. Measure the zone diameters around antibiotic disks or the point
where the elliptical zone of inhibition intersects the E-test strip.
2. For broth microdilution, determine the lowest concentration
where no visible growth is observed (MIC).
3. Compare results to CLSI (Clinical Laboratory Standards
Institute) breakpoints to interpret sensitivity or resistance.
D. Quality Control
1. Perform AST using quality control strains and compare results
against expected values.
2. Document any deviations and take corrective action as needed.
E. Reporting
1. Enter results into the laboratory information system (LIS).
2. Critical values and unusual resistance patterns should be
communicated promptly to the appropriate clinical personnel.
3. Include an interpretative comment as needed.
8. LIMITATIONS
• Fastidious and slow-growing anaerobes may require prolonged
incubation times.
• Antimicrobial activity can be influenced by testing conditions;
standardization of procedures is essential.
• Ensure the absence of contamination by strict anaerobic
techniques during inoculation and culturing.
9. SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS
• Follow appropriate biosafety guidelines when handling infectious
materials.
• Use personal protective equipment (PPE) at all times.
• Dispose of biohazardous waste according to institutional policies.
