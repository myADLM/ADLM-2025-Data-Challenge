Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for ANTIMICROBIAL
SUSCEPTIBILITY, MYCOBACTERIUM TUBERCULOSIS
COMPLEX, FIRST LINE, VARIES
1. PURPOSE
This protocol outlines the procedures for carrying out antimicrobial
susceptibility testing (AST) for Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex
(MTBC) against first-line antitubercular drugs. Adherence to this
procedure ensures accurate, reliable, and reproducible results.
Responsibilities:
• Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing
antimicrobial susceptibility testing as defined in this SOP.
• Supervisors are responsible for overseeing the adherence to this
SOP and for the troubleshooting of any observed issues during
testing.
1. SPECIMEN
2.1 Acceptable Specimen Types:
• MTBC isolates cultured from clinical specimens such as sputum,
bronchoalveolar lavage, pleural fluid, or tissue biopsies.
2.2 Specimen Handling:
• Specimen culture must be performed under biosafety level 3
(BSL-3) conditions.
• Ensure isolates are pure cultures to avoid contamination and
inaccurate results.
1. REAGENTS AND MATERIALS
3.1 Media and Reagents:
• Middlebrook 7H10 or 7H11 agar plates
• Middlebrook 7H9 broth with OADC enrichment
• Antimicrobial reagent powders for isoniazid (INH), rifampin (RIF),
ethambutol (EMB), and pyrazinamide (PZA)
• Sterile saline solution (0.85%)
• Mycobacterium growth indicator tube (MGIT) system (optional)
3.2 Equipment:
• Biosafety cabinet (BSC)
• Incubator set at 37°C
• Sterile loops and pipettes
• Inoculating needles
• Measuring scale or balance
• Autoclave or sterile filtration equipment
• Vortex mixer
1. PROCEDURE
4.1 Preparation of Drug Stock Solutions: a. Prepare stock solutions of
first-line drugs according to manufacturer instructions. Sterilize by
filtration where necessary. b. Stock concentrations for each drug:
• Isoniazid (INH): 10 mg/mL
• Rifampin (RIF): 20 mg/mL
• Ethambutol (EMB): 25 mg/mL
• Pyrazinamide (PZA): 40 mg/mL
4.2 Preparation of Susceptibility Testing Media: a. Middlebrook 7H10
or 7H11 plates supplemented with OADC. b. For PZA specifically, use
an appropriate acidic medium (e.g., Middlebrook 7H10 adjusted to
pH 5.5).
4.3 Inoculum Preparation: a. Pick colonies of MTBC from a pure
culture and emulsify them in sterile saline to a turbidity equivalent to
a 0.5 McFarland standard. b. Vortex the suspension for homogeneity.
4.4 Drug Susceptibility Testing (DST) using Proportion Method: a.
Prepare drug-containing media plates:
• Dilute stock solutions to working concentrations directly on plates
at the following final concentrations:
◦ INH: 0.2 μg/mL
◦ RIF: 1 μg/mL
◦ EMB: 5 μg/mL
◦ PZA: 100 μg/mL b. Add 0.5 mL of the bacterial suspension
onto plates with and without antibiotics. c. Spread evenly using
a sterile loop to ensure uniform distribution.
4.5 Incubation: a. Incubate all inoculated plates at 37°C. b. Observe
plates weekly for growth and incubate for a total duration of 3-4
weeks. c. Record the results on designated log sheets.
4.6 Reading and Interpretation: a. Record the number of CFUs on
drug-containing and drug-free control plates. b. Calculate the
proportion of resistant organisms:
• Proportion (%) = (Number of CFUs on drug plate / Number of
CFUs on drug-free plate) x 100% c. Interpret results based on
resistance cut-off values:
• Resistant if ≥1% of the inoculum grows in the presence of the
drug.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
Regular Quality Control:
• Run control strains of MTBC with known susceptibility profiles
with each batch of testing.
• Record and review control results.
• Ensure deviations are documented and corrective actions are
taken.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
Verify and record results in the Lab Information System (LIS):
• Susceptibility profiles should include interpretations (resistant,
intermediate, or susceptible) for INH, RIF, EMB, and PZA.
• Review by a qualified technologist and a designated supervisor.

1. DOCUMENTATION
Maintain documentation of all results, quality control records, and any
corrective actions taken in compliance with laboratory accreditation
and regulatory requirements.
This SOP ensures consistent, reliable, and reproducible results for
antimicrobial susceptibility testing of Mycobacterium tuberculosis
complex against first-line drugs, consequently aiding in clinical
decision-making.
