Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Analytical Phase
for Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (AST) for
Nocardia Species and Other Aerobic Actinomycetes
1. PURPOSE
To define the procedure for performing and interpreting antimicrobial
susceptibility testing (AST) for Nocardia species and other aerobic
actinomycetes in accordance with approved standards to ensure
accurate and clinically relevant results are reported.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
Laboratory personnel are responsible for performing and
documenting AST for Nocardia species and other aerobic
actinomycetes. It is also the responsibility of the laboratory personnel
to ensure that the quality control measures are followed, and results
are reported accurately.
3. DEFINITIONS
Nocardia species and other aerobic actinomycetes are a group of
bacteria that are Gram-positive, rod-shaped organisms known to
cause infection in humans, particularly in immunocompromised
patients.
4. EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS
• Bacteriological incubator set at 35-37°C
• Mueller-Hinton agar supplemented with 5% sheep blood
• Antimicrobial discs or MIC testing plates specific for the required
antibiotics
• Quality control strains (American Type Culture Collection)
• Microbial identification system (e.g., MALDI-TOF MS) for initial
organism identification
• Calibrated inoculating loops, sterile swabs
• Sterile saline
• Vortex mixer
• Documentation materials (e.g., test request forms, worksheets,
logs)
5. PROCEDURE
5.1. Preparation of Inoculum
1. Confirm the identification of Nocardia or other aerobic
actinomycetes isolates using MALDI-TOF MS or other validated
microbial identification systems.
2. From a pure culture, select 3-5 well-isolated colonies using a
sterile loop.
3. Suspend the selected colonies in 3-5 mL of sterile saline to
achieve a turbidity equivalent to a 0.5 McFarland standard
(approximately 1-2 x 10^8 CFU/mL).
5.2. Inoculation and Incubation
1. Using a sterile swab, dip into the prepared inoculum and
remove excess liquid by pressing it against the inside wall of
the tube.
2. Evenly streak the entire surface of a Mueller-Hinton agar plate
supplemented with 5% sheep blood by swabbing in three
planes to ensure a uniform lawn of bacterial growth.
3. Place the antimicrobial discs on the agar surface with sterile
forceps or a disc dispenser, ensuring adequate spacing for
clear zone formation.
4. Incubate the plates at 35-37°C for 48 hours in an ambient air
incubator.
5.3. Reading and Interpretation of Results
1. After the incubation period, examine the plates for uniform lawn
growth and clear, measurable zones of inhibition around each
antibiotic disc.
2. Measure the diameter of the zones of inhibition using calipers
or a ruler, and record the results in millimeters.
3. Compare the zone diameters to established interpretive criteria
tables (e.g., CLSI M62 document) for susceptible, intermediate,
or resistant categorization.
5.4. Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) Testing (Optional)
1. Prepare the inoculum as described above, and inoculate MIC
testing plates according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Incubate as described and read according to the guidelines
provided by the testing system.
3. Record the MIC values and compare them to interpretive
breakpoints.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Perform AST for quality control strains concurrently with patient
isolates, according to the manufacturer's recommendations.
2. Record and monitor the results of quality control strains to
ensure they fall within the expected ranges.
3. Any out-of-range QC results must be investigated and rectified
before reporting patient results.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Enter the interpreted susceptibility categories (S, I, R) for each
antibiotic into the LIS.
2. Clearly indicate any additional comments or suggestions about
treatment based on the susceptibility profile.
3. Report critical results to the clinician immediately by phone and
follow up with documentation of the communication.
8. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Refer to the latest Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute
(CLSI) guidelines for interpretation criteria specific to Nocardia
species and other aerobic actinomycetes.
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
1. Inoculum preparation, proper disc placement, and uniform lawn
growth are critical for accurate results; variations can
significantly affect test outcomes.
2. Interpretation should consider the clinical scenario and
organism identification.
