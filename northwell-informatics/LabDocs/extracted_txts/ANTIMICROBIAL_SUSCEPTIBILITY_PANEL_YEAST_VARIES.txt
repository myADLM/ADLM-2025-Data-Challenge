Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Analytical Phase:
ANTIMICROBIAL SUSCEPTIBILITY PANEL, YEAST, VARIES
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to ensure accurate and reliable
antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) for yeast in clinical
specimens. This SOP outlines the steps to be followed for performing
and interpreting the antimicrobial susceptibility panel for yeast
isolates to predict the effectiveness of antimicrobial agents.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of the laboratory personnel to follow the
outlined procedures and to ensure that the results are validated and
recorded accurately. It is also their responsibility to report any
deviations, inconsistencies, or issues encountered during the testing
process to the supervisor.
1. DEFINITIONS
Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (AST): A laboratory procedure
used to determine the susceptibility of yeast isolates to different
antimicrobial agents.
Yeast: A group of single-celled fungi, including Candida and
Cryptococcus species, which can cause infections in humans.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Reagents and Supplies
• Yeast isolates from clinical specimens
• Susceptibility test media (e.g., Mueller-Hinton Agar with Glucose
and Methylene Blue for Candida)
• Antimicrobial agents (available as standardized disks, E-test
strips, or MIC panels)
• Sterile saline or broth (e.g., 0.85% NaCl solution)
• Inoculating loops or swabs
• Incubators set at appropriate temperatures (e.g., 35 ± 2 ºC)
• Appropriate quality control strains (e.g., Candida albicans ATCC
90028)
• Multichannel pipettes and sterile tips
• Sterile tubes and plates
• Spectrophotometer (optional)
• Data recording sheets and marker for plate labeling
B. Preparation of Inoculum
1. Pick 4-5 isolated colonies of the yeast from an agar plate that
has been incubated for 24-48 hours.
2. Suspend the colonies in 5 mL of sterile saline or broth to
achieve a turbidity equivalent to a 0.5 McFarland standard
(approximately 1-2 x 10^6 CFU/mL). Use a spectrophotometer
to validate turbidity if available. Adjust as necessary.
3. Vortex the suspension to create an even suspension of yeast
cells.
C. Inoculation of Test Plates
1. Within 15 minutes of preparing the inoculum, dip a sterile swab
into the suspension. Remove excess liquid by pressing the
swab against the side of the tube.
2. Streak the entire surface of a susceptibility test medium plate
(e.g., Mueller-Hinton Agar with Glucose and Methylene Blue) in
three directions, ensuring uniform coverage.
3. Allow the inoculum to dry for 3-5 minutes before applying
antibiotics.
D. Application of Antimicrobial Agents
1. Apply the antimicrobial agents in a standardized manner:
◦ For disk diffusion: Place antimicrobial disks on the surface of
the inoculated plate at appropriate distances, ensuring
complete contact with the agar.
◦ For E-test: Place E-test strips onto the inoculated plate
surface.
◦ For MIC testing: Inoculate the MIC panel according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Apply gentle pressure to ensure proper adherence of the disks
or strips to the agar surface.
E. Incubation
1. Incubate the plates and MIC panels in an inverted position at 35
± 2 ºC.
2. Maximum incubation time: 24 hours (Candida species) or as
specified for the yeast species or test methodology being used.
F. Reading and Interpretation of Results
1. After incubation, measure the zone diameters around each
disk/E-test strip or read the MIC endpoints as per manufacturer
guidelines.
2. Interpret the results using the Clinical and Laboratory
Standards Institute (CLSI) M44 guidelines for antifungal
susceptibility or the manufacturer's interpretive criteria.
G. Quality Control
1. Use quality control strains (e.g., Candida albicans ATCC 90028)
to verify test accuracy.
2. Include QC strains in each testing batch and ensure results fall
within the established control ranges.
3. Document and address any QC failures or discrepancies.
H. Reporting Results
1. Record the interpretive results (S = Susceptible, I =
Intermediate, R = Resistant) in the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
2. Report any critical results immediately to the healthcare
provider as per laboratory policy.
3. Ensure complete and accurate documentation of all test results,
including any comments about unusual findings or test
limitations.

1. DOCUMENTATION
All records of testing, including preparation, inoculation, application,
incubation, readings, and reports, must be documented in the
appropriate logs and the LIS as per laboratory policies. QC results,
corrective actions, and maintenance activities should also be
documented clearly to ensure compliance and traceability.
1. SAFETY AND WASTE DISPOSAL
Adhere to all biosafety regulations, including the use of appropriate
personal protective equipment (PPE). Dispose of all waste, including
used plates, swabs, and other disposables, as per the laboratory's
biohazard disposal guidelines. Decontaminate work areas and
equipment regularly to prevent cross-contamination and maintain a
safe work environment.
