Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical
Phase of Generating Results for Anti-Müllerian
Hormone (AMH), Serum
1. PURPOSE
To ensure the accurate and precise measurement of Anti-Müllerian
Hormone (AMH) in serum samples, providing reliable data for clinical
assessment and decision making.
2. SCOPE
This procedure is applicable to the measurement of AMH in serum
samples using an automated immunoassay analyzer. It is intended
for use by qualified laboratory personnel trained in the operation and
maintenance of the specific immunoassay system employed.
3. RESPONSIBILITIES
• Designated Staff: Responsible for performing the assay,
including sample processing, instrument operation, quality control,
and initial data review.
• Supervisors: Ensure adherence to procedures, verify results,
and manage any troubleshooting required.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Automated Immunoassay Analyzer (e.g., Roche Cobas e411,
Beckman Coulter Access, or equivalent)
• AMH Reagents Kit: Specific to the immunoassay analyzer in use,
stored and used according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
• Calibrators and Controls: Provided with the reagent kit or
obtained separately, stored as recommended by the
manufacturer.
• Serum Samples: Properly collected, labeled, and stored as per
pre-analytical procedures.
5. PROCEDURE
A) Sample Preparation
1. Specimen Collection: Ensure serum specimens are collected
following standard venipuncture procedures with minimal
hemolysis.
2. Sample Storage: Samples should be stored at 2-8°C if
analyzed within 48 hours. For longer storage, freeze at -20°C or
lower.
3. Thawing Frozen Samples: Thaw frozen specimens completely
at room temperature and mix thoroughly before analysis. Avoid
repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
B) Instrument Preparation
1. Initialization and Calibration:
◦ Turn on the immunoassay analyzer and complete the
initialization process.
◦ Load the reagent kits, calibrators, and controls into the
designated positions in the analyzer.
◦ Perform a system calibration using the provided calibrator,
following the manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Ensure calibration curves are within acceptable ranges
before proceeding.
2. Quality Control:
◦ Run internal quality controls (e.g., low, medium, and high)
before analyzing patient samples.
◦ Verify that quality control results are within the acceptable
ranges as specified by the manufacturer.
◦ Document QC results in the QC logbook or within the
Laboratory Information System (LIS).
C) Assay Procedure
1. Sample Load and Analysis:
◦ Load serum samples into the sample rack or carousel
according to the instrument’s requirements.
◦ Enter sample IDs and other necessary information into the
LIS or directly into the analyzer’s software.
◦ Start the analysis run according to the analyzer’s standard
operating procedure.
2. During Analysis:
◦ Monitor the analyzer for any alerts or error messages and
address issues promptly.
◦ Ensure continuous availability of consumables (e.g.,
reagents, buffers) during the run.
D) Post-Analysis
1. Data Review:
◦ Upon completion of the assay, review raw data for any
indications of assay failure or sample integrity issues.
◦ Validate control and patient results according to laboratory
quality standards.
2. Result Reporting:
◦ Enter validated results into the LIS for review and reporting.
◦ Flag any critical or abnormal results and notify the
appropriate medical personnel as per laboratory policy.
3. Record Keeping:
◦ Maintain records of calibration, quality control, and patient
results according to regulatory standards.
◦ Document any troubleshooting, deviations, or corrective
actions taken during the analytical phase.
6. QUALITY CONTROL AND PROFICIENCY TESTING
• Follow the laboratory’s quality control policies for running daily
controls and participating in external proficiency testing programs.
• Investigate and resolve any incidents of out-of-control conditions,
document corrective actions, and ensure continuity of accurate
results.
7. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to the manufacturer’s instructions for the specific limits of
detection, assay interferences, and any special instructions for
handling unusual specimens.
8. SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS
• Follow standard biosafety guidelines as specified in the laboratory
safety manual.
• Use personal protective equipment (PPE) as required while
handling specimens and reagents.
