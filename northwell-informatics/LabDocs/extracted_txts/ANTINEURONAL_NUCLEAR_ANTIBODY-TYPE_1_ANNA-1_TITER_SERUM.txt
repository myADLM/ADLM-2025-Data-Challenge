Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Analytical Phase
of Generating Results for ANTINEURONAL NUCLEAR
ANTIBODY-TYPE 1 (ANNA-1) TITER, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized protocol for the detection and titration of
Antineuronal Nuclear Antibody-Type 1 (ANNA-1) in serum samples,
ensuring quality and consistency in results generation.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of laboratory personnel to perform the analysis
following these procedures accurately and consistently. Supervisors
are responsible for ensuring adherence to this SOP.
3. PRINCIPLE
The test detects antibodies against neuronal nuclear antigens, often
associated with paraneoplastic neurological syndromes. The method
involves indirect immunofluorescence or enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA), with results interpreted qualitatively
and quantitatively.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred specimen: 1 mL serum sample.
• Specimens must be freshly collected and transported to the lab
on ice.
• Acceptable collection containers: Red top or serum separator
tube (SST).
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Microscopy equipment (fluorescence microscope) or ELISA
reader.
• Reagents for immunofluorescence or ELISA.
• Positive and negative controls.
• Titer plates/slides.
• Pipettes and sterile tips.
• Wash buffers.
• Cover slips and mounting media for immunofluorescence.
6. PROCEDURE: INDIRECT IMMUNOFLUORESCENCE METHOD
Preparation
1. Prepare Slides:
◦ Allow slides with neuronal tissue sections to reach room
temperature.
◦ Label slides with appropriate identification.
2. Prepare Controls:
◦ Include positive and negative control sera with each batch of
tests.
Assay Procedure
1. Dilute Serum Samples:
◦ Dilute patient serum samples 1:10 initially, with further serial
dilutions if necessary.
◦ Apply 50 µL of diluted serum onto the designated area of the
slide.
2. Incubation:
◦ Incubate the slides in a moist chamber at room temperature
for 30 minutes.
3. Wash Slides:
◦ Rinse slides gently with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)
and place them in a slide holder.
◦ Wash slides in PBS for 5 minutes, 3 times.
4. Apply Secondary Antibody:
◦ Apply 50 µL of fluorescently labeled anti-human IgG to each
area of the slide.
5. Incubation:
◦ Incubate in the moist chamber at room temperature for
another 30 minutes.
6. Final Washes:
◦ Repeat the washing with PBS as described previously.
7. Mounting:
◦ Add a drop of mounting medium and cover with a coverslip.
8. Examine under Fluorescence Microscope:
◦ Read and interpret results immediately.
◦ Record the fluorescence intensity and distribution pattern.
7. PROCEDURE: ELISA METHOD
Preparation
1. Prepare Plates:
◦ Coating antigen plates should be prepared as per
manufacturer instructions.
◦ Label plates with appropriate identification.
2. Prepare Controls:
◦ Include positive and negative control sera in each run.
Assay Procedure
1. Dilute Serum Samples:
◦ Dilute patient serum samples 1:100 in sample diluent.
◦ Pipette 100 µL of diluted sample into designated wells.
2. Incubation:
◦ Incubate plates at 37°C for 60 minutes.
3. Wash Plates:
◦ Wash plates 4 times with wash buffer following incubation.
4. Apply Secondary Antibody:
◦ Add 100 µL of enzyme-labeled anti-human IgG to each well.
5. Incubation:
◦ Incubate plates at 37°C for another 30 minutes.
6. Final Washes:
◦ Wash the plates 4 times with wash buffer.
7. Substrate Addition:
◦ Add 100 µL of substrate solution to each well.
8. Develop Color:
◦ Incubate at room temperature for 10-15 minutes in the dark.
9. Stopping Reaction:
◦ Add stop solution to each well.
10. Read Results:
◦ Read at the appropriate wavelength using an ELISA reader.
◦ Calculate results and interpret as per manufacturer
recommendations.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform all assays with positive and negative controls.
• Record control results on a Quality Control log sheet.
• Validate each new batch of reagents with known controls.
• Troubleshoot and document any deviations from expected results.
• Reassay samples if results for controls do not fall within the
specified range.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Provide results with corresponding titers or as a qualitative
(positive/negative) result.
• Review and verify results before release by certified laboratory
personnel.
10. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions for immunofluorescence and ELISA
kits.
• Clinical Laboratory Guidelines.
11. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS
• Use personal protective equipment (PPE) at all times.
• Handle all specimens as potentially infectious.
• Dispose of biohazard waste according to standard laboratory
protocols.
This SOP ensures the reliable and standardized processing of
ANNA-1 titer tests from serum samples, maintaining high quality and
consistency in diagnostic outputs.
