Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase - Generation of Results for Antineuronal
Nuclear Antibody-Type 1 (ANNA-1) Titer, Spinal Fluid
Document Number: ANNA-1_SF_01
Effective Date: [Insert Effective Date]
Revision Number: 1.0
Approval: [Insert Approval Authority]
1. PURPOSE
To ensure accurate and reliable generation of results for Antineuronal
Nuclear Antibody-Type 1 (ANNA-1) Titer in spinal fluid, following
validated protocols for testing and analysis.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for conducting the testing
and documenting the results as defined in this procedure.
Supervisors are responsible for ensuring adherence to the SOP,
performing necessary corrective actions, and verification of results.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
• Acceptable Specimen: Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) collected via
lumbar puncture, stored at 2-8°C upon reception and for analysis
within 24 hours.
• Unacceptable Specimen: Samples with significant hemolysis,
improper labeling, or samples received after 24 hours of collection
without proper storage conditions.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Automated ELISA Reader
• Pipettes and tips (calibrated)
• Centrifuge (for sample preparation)
• Controls and calibrators for ANNA-1 testing
• ANNA-1 ELISA kit (Validated, not expired)
• Proper PPE (lab coats, gloves, etc.)
5. PROCEDURE
5.1 Calibration and Quality Control
• Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for calibration of the ELISA
reader.
• Analyze low, medium, and high ANNA-1 concentration controls
before running patient samples. Results must fall within
established ranges:
◦ Perform quality control checks every day of testing. If controls
fail, do not proceed with sample testing until resolved.
• Record and log control results.
5.2 Sample Preparation
• Centrifuge the spinal fluid sample at 1500 RPM for 10 minutes to
separate any particulate matter.
• Aliquot the clarified supernatant into appropriately labeled ELISA
wells.
5.3 Testing Procedure
• Follow the kit instructions to run the ANNA-1 ELISA assay.
◦ Add reagent: Follow step-by-step instructions provided in the
ELISA kit to add all reagents (wash buffer, enzyme conjugate,
substrate, etc.).
◦ Incubation: Allow plates to incubate at recommended times
specified in the kit insert.
◦ Washing: Perform washing steps as specified, ensuring
thorough removal of unbound reagents.
◦ Reading: Read the absorbance values on the ELISA reader at
the specified wavelength.
5.4 Analysis and Documentation
• Interpret results using the standard curve generated from the
control samples.
• Calculate the titer of ANNA-1 in the spinal fluid sample.
• Document results including calculations, control data, and any
deviations or observations in the assay run.
• Supervisor will review and verify results before reporting.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results will be reported in titers as per clinical guidelines.
• Any critical or unexpected results must be communicated directly
to the ordering physician.
• Documentation of results should be entered into the LIS and
verified for accuracy.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run positive and negative controls with each batch of samples.
• Daily documentation of equipment maintenance and calibration.
• Maintain logs of reagent lot numbers and their expiry dates.
8. TROUBLESHOOTING AND CORRECTIVE ACTION
• If controls are out of range, recalibrate the equipment, check the
reagents for expiration, and re-run controls.
• Document all troubleshooting steps and corrective actions in the
logbook.
9. SAFETY AND COMPLIANCE
• Adhere to laboratory safety protocols at all times including the use
of PPE.
• Comply with all relevant regulatory requirements including CLIA
guidelines.
