Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Antineuronal Nuclear Antibody Type 2 (ANNA-2) Titer, Serum
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the procedure for performing and documenting the
analysis of Antineuronal Nuclear Antibody Type 2 (ANNA-2) titer in
serum samples. This test aids in the diagnosis of paraneoplastic
neurological syndromes.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel performing the
ANNA-2 titer test in a CLIA-certified laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITIES
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for:
• Performing the test according to this SOP.
• Accurately documenting all steps and results.
• Notifying the supervisor of any issues that may affect test results.
• Ensuring quality control measures are followed.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred Specimen Type: Serum
• Specimen Collection: Collect blood sample using standard
venipuncture technique. Allow the blood to clot and separate
serum by centrifugation.
• Minimum Volume: 1 mL of serum
• Specimen Stability: Serum is stable at room temperature for up
to 8 hours, refrigerated at 2-8°C for up to 48 hours, or frozen at
-20°C for up to 3 months.
• Unacceptable Specimens: Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric
samples.
5. REAGENTS, EQUIPMENT, AND SUPPLIES
• Reagents:
◦ ANNA-2 indirect immunofluorescence kit or ELISA kit (validate
by manufacturer)
◦ Positive and negative control sera
• Equipment:
◦ Fluorescence microscope (for IFA) or ELISA reader
◦ Pipettes and tips
◦ Micropipettes (variable volumes)
◦ Centrifuge
◦ Incubator
• Supplies:
◦ Glass slides (for IFA) or microtiter plates (for ELISA)
◦ Cover slips
◦ Test tubes
◦ Calibration and maintenance logbooks
6. PROCEDURE
A. Indirect Immunofluorescence Assay (IFA):
1. Preparation:
◦ Preheat the incubator to 37°C.
◦ Allow the kit reagents and serum samples to come to room
temperature before starting the assay.
◦ Label glass slides with sample and control identifications.
2. Dilution:
◦ Dilute patient serum samples and controls as per the kit
instructions (typically 1:10 to 1:1000).
3. Incubation:
◦ Apply the diluted patient sera and controls to the slides.
◦ Incubate the slides in a moist chamber at 37°C for 30
minutes.
4. Washing:
◦ Wash the slides with PBS buffer for three 5-minute cycles.
◦ Remove excess buffer by gently blotting the slides.
5. Conjugation:
◦ Apply the fluorescent conjugate to the slides.
◦ Incubate again in a moist chamber at 37°C for 30 minutes.
6. Final Washing:
◦ Wash the slides with PBS buffer as described earlier.
◦ Rinse slides briefly with distilled water and dry.
7. Observation:
◦ Mount the cover slips using mounting medium.
◦ Observe the slides under a fluorescence microscope.
◦ Record the titer as the highest dilution showing
characteristic ANNA-2 staining.
B. ELISA:
1. Preparation:
◦ Preheat the incubator to 37°C.
◦ Allow the kit reagents and serum samples to come to room
temperature before starting the assay.
◦ Label microtiter plate wells with sample and control
identifications.
2. Dilution:
◦ Dilute patient serum samples and controls according to the
kit instructions.
3. Incubation:
◦ Add the diluted patient sera and controls to the microtiter
plate wells.
◦ Incubate the plate at 37°C for 30 minutes.
4. Washing:
◦ Wash the wells with the washing buffer provided in the kit for
three 5-minute cycles.
5. Conjugation:
◦ Add the enzyme conjugate to the wells.
◦ Incubate the plate at 37°C for 30 minutes.
6. Final Washing:
◦ Wash the wells as described earlier.
7. Substrate Reaction:
◦ Add the substrate solution to each well.
◦ Incubate at room temperature for the time specified in the kit
protocol.
8. Stopping Reaction:
◦ Add the stop solution to each well to terminate the substrate
reaction.
9. Reading:
◦ Measure the absorbance of each well using an ELISA
reader.
◦ Calculate the titer according to the kit protocol.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run positive and negative controls with each batch of patient
samples.
• Document quality control results in the logbook.
• If controls are out of range, investigate and resolve before
reporting patient results.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Verify and validate results against the laboratory's reference
ranges and clinical context.
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS) for
review and reporting.
• Critical values must be immediately communicated to the
requesting physician or appropriate clinical personnel.
9. REFERENCE RANGES
• Reference ranges as provided in the test kit or established by the
laboratory's performance validation studies.
10. DOCUMENTATION AND RECORD KEEPING
• All steps of the procedure and results must be recorded in the
appropriate logbooks.
• Maintain records for quality control, maintenance, and calibration
of equipment.
11. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's protocol for the ANNA-2 indirect
immunofluorescence kit or ELISA kit.
• Laboratory quality management system documentation.
