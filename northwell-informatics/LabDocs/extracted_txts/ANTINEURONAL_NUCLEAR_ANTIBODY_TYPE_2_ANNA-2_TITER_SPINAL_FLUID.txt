Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for ANTINEURONAL
NUCLEAR ANTIBODY TYPE 2 (ANNA-2) TITER in SPINAL FLUID
1. PURPOSE
To provide a detailed, standardized procedure for the analysis of
Antineuronal Nuclear Antibody Type 2 (ANNA-2) titer in spinal fluid
(CSF) using indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA). This
procedure details the steps involved in preparation, processing, and
analysis to ensure reliable, accurate, and consistent results.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of designated laboratory personnel to adhere
strictly to this SOP for all analytical processes pertaining to ANNA-2
titer in spinal fluid. All personnel must report any deficiencies or
issues encountered during the procedure to the supervising
laboratory technologist or manager.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) kits, specifically
designed for detection of ANNA-2 antibodies
• Pre-prepared antigen slides containing neuronal tissue
• Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) conjugated secondary antibody
• Micropipettes (10-100 μL, 100-1000 μL) and tips
• Humidity chamber
• Cover slips
• Fluorescence microscope
• Positive and negative control sera
• PBS (Phosphate Buffered Saline)
• Mounting medium
• Timer
• Vortex mixer
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type: Spinal Fluid (Cerebrospinal fluid - CSF)
Preferred Conditions: Freshly collected CSF, stored and transported
at 2-8°C
Unacceptable Conditions:
• Samples collected over 24 hours old without refrigeration
• Samples showing signs of contamination or significant hemolysis
• Samples with insufficient volumes (less than 1 mL)
1. PROCEDURE
4.1 Preparation
1. Upon receipt, verify that the specimen is properly labeled and
meets the acceptance criteria.
2. Log the specimen into the laboratory information system (LIS).
3. Allow specimen to equilibrate to room temperature before
analysis.
4.2 ANNA-2 IFA Assay
1. Prepare antigen slides according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
2. Using a micropipette, add 10-20 μL of the patient’s CSF onto
the well of the slide containing neuronal tissue.
3. Add positive and negative control sera to separate wells on the
slide.
4. Incubate the slide in a humidity chamber at room temperature
for 30 minutes.
5. Wash the slide gently with PBS to remove unbound sample.
6. Add FITC-conjugated secondary antibody to each well and
incubate the slide in the humidity chamber at room temperature
for an additional 30 minutes.
7. Wash the slide again with PBS to remove unbound secondary
antibody.
8. Place a drop of mounting medium on each well and cover with
a cover slip.
4.3 Microscopic Analysis
1. Examine the slide under a fluorescence microscope at the
appropriate excitation and emission wavelengths.
2. Look for specific staining patterns indicative of ANNA-2
antibodies.
3. Compare the staining intensity of the patient sample with that of
the positive and negative control.
4.4 Titration
1. If positive staining is observed, perform serial dilutions of the
patient’s CSF (1:10, 1:100, 1:1000, etc.).
2. Repeat the IFA procedure for each dilution to determine the
endpoint titer (the highest dilution at which specific staining is
observed).
3. QUALITY CONTROL
• Use positive and negative control sera with each batch of tests to
ensure the assay is performing correctly.
• Document all control results in the Quality Control Log along with
the patient results.
• If the controls do not yield expected results, troubleshoot the
assay and repeat before reporting patient results.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
2. Enter the results into the LIS, including the dilution that
corresponds to the endpoint titer.
3. Verify alignment with the control results and cross-check for any
inconsistencies.
4. Report the results according to laboratory protocol.
5. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Cross-reactivity with other neuronal antibodies may occur; results
should be interpreted in clinical context.
• Hemolyzed or contaminated specimens may yield inaccurate
results.
• High background fluorescence may interfere with the
interpretation.
