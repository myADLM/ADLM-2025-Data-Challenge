Standard Operating Procedure for Determining Antineuronal
Nuclear Antibody Type 3 (ANNA-3) Titer, Serum
1. PURPOSE
This procedure describes the steps required for the analytical
measurement of Antineuronal Nuclear Antibody Type 3 (ANNA-3) titer
in serum samples, ensuring accurate and reproducible results that
meet quality standards.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to the authorized clinical laboratory personnel
performing the ANNA-3 titer testing using the designated laboratory
equipment and reagents.
3. RESPONSIBILITIES
• Laboratory Personnel: Responsible for executing the steps
outlined in this SOP and ensuring the maintenance of testing
integrity.
• Laboratory Supervisor: Ensures that all personnel are adequately
trained and that all procedures are followed correctly.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type: Serum Volume Required: Minimum of 1 mL serum
Collection Instructions:
• Collect blood in a red-top tube or serum separator tube (SST).
• Allow the specimen to clot at room temperature for 30 minutes.
• Centrifuge to separate serum as soon as possible. Specimen
Stability:
• Room Temperature: Unacceptable
• Refrigerated (2-8°C): 48 hours
• Frozen (-20°C or colder): 2 months Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples
• Specimens collected in tubes other than red-top or SST
• Specimens failing to meet volume requirements
5. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• ELISA Reader or Immunofluorescence Microscope
• Micropipettes (adjustable)
• Calibration Standards and Tracers
• Samples and Control Serums
• ANNA-3 Detection Kit including buffer solutions, washing
solutions, enzyme conjugates, and substrate
• Incubator
• Deionized Water
6. QUALITY CONTROL
Internal Quality Controls:
• Positive and Negative controls must be included in each batch of
the test.
• Controls must fall within reference range provided by the
manufacturer for the run to be valid. External Quality Control:
• Participate in external proficiency testing programs.
7. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
• Allow all reagents, control sera, and samples to reach room
temperature (20-25°C) before starting the assay.
• Label microtiter wells for standards, controls, and patient samples
accordingly.
Procedure: 1. Sample Dilution:
1. Dilute serum samples 1:10 with the provided sample diluent.
2. Incubation Step:
1. Add 100 µL of diluted sample, standard, and controls to the
wells.
2. Incubate at room temperature for 60 minutes. Ensure the plate
is covered to minimize evaporation.
3. Washing:
1. Wash wells 3-5 times with provided washing solution to remove
unbound substances.
4. Enzyme Conjugate Addition:
1. Add 100 µL of enzyme conjugate to all wells.
2. Incubate at room temperature for 30 minutes.
5. Substrate Addition:
1. Wash wells 3-5 times with washing solution to remove unbound
enzyme conjugate.
2. Add 100 µL substrate solution to each well.
3. Incubate for 15 minutes in the dark at room temperature.
6. Stop Reaction:
1. Add 50 µL sulfuric acid stop solution to each well.
7. Reading the Plate:
1. Measure absorbance at 450 nm using an ELISA reader within
30 minutes of stopping the reaction.
8. Calculation of Results:
1. Calculate the mean absorbance for the standards, controls, and
patient samples.
2. Generate the standard curve by plotting the absorbance of
standards against their respective concentrations.
3. Determine the concentration of ANNA-3 in patient samples from
the standard curve.
8. RESULTS INTERPRETATION AND REPORTING
• Reference Interval: Interpret results qualitatively; positive results
indicate the presence of ANNA-3.
• Critical Values: Any critical results must be reported to the
requesting physician immediately per laboratory guidelines.
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Cross-reactivity with other antibodies may lead to false positives.
• Samples with high background absorbance may not be valid and
should be repeated.
• Results should be correlated with clinical findings and other
diagnostic tests.
10. RECORD KEEPING
• Record lot numbers, expiration dates, and quality control results
in the laboratory records.
• Maintain logs for instrument maintenance, calibration, and
performance.
