Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Antineuronal Nuclear Antibody Type 3 (ANNA-3) Titer, Spinal
Fluid
1. PURPOSE
To define the protocols and steps for the analytical phase in the
determination and reporting of Antineuronal Nuclear Antibody Type 3
(ANNA-3) Titer in spinal fluid using the appropriate methodologies.
The purpose is to ensure consistent, accurate, and reliable results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
All laboratory personnel performing the procedure are responsible for
adhering to the protocol outlined below. The laboratory supervisor is
responsible for overseeing the process and ensuring compliance with
the procedure. Any aberrations or unexpected results should be
reported immediately to the supervisor.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type:
• Spinal fluid (CSF) collected via lumbar puncture.
Specimen Volume:
• Preferred: 1.0 mL of CSF.
• Minimum: 0.5 mL of CSF.
Specimen Stability:
• CSF should be kept at 2-8°C if not processed immediately and
analyzed within 48 hours.
• For longer storage, specimens should be frozen at -20°C or lower.
Unacceptable Conditions:
• Specimens that are visibly contaminated with blood.
• Specimens that have been stored under incorrect conditions.
• Specimens with visible particulates other than cells.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Centrifuge
• Micropipettes and Pipette Tips
• Incubator (37°C)
• Fluorescent microscope
Reagents:
• ANNA-3 specific antibodies
• Secondary antibody conjugated with fluorophore
• PBS (Phosphate Buffered Saline) solution
• Mounting medium
Supplies:
• Clean glass slides
• Cover slips
• Absorbent paper
• Polypropylene tubes
5. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation and Setup
1. Labeling: Ensure all tubes, slides, and other materials are
correctly labeled with patient information.
2. Pre-treatment of Slides: Prepare slides by coating with poly-L-
lysine if necessary.
3. Preparation of Controls: Prepare positive and negative control
slides alongside patient test slides.
B. Specimen Processing
1. Centrifugation: Centrifuge the spinal fluid specimen at 1500
rpm for 10 minutes to remove any cells and debris.
2. Supernatant Collection: Collect the supernatant carefully
without disturbing the pellet.
3. Dilution: Prepare dilutions of the supernatant in PBS for testing
(e.g., 1:10, 1:100, 1:1000).
C. Immunofluorescence Assay
1. Specimen Application: Apply 50 µL of diluted specimen on the
designated areas of the prepared slides.
2. Incubation: Incubate the slides in a humid chamber at room
temperature for 30 minutes.
3. Washing: Rinse slides gently with PBS to remove unbound
material.
4. Secondary Antibody: Apply the fluorophore-conjugated
secondary antibody to each well and incubate for another 30
minutes in the dark.
5. Final Washing: Wash the slides again with PBS and allow
them to air-dry.
6. Mounting: Add a drop of mounting medium onto each well and
cover with a cover slip.
D. Analysis
1. Microscopy: Examine the slides using a fluorescent
microscope equipped with the appropriate filters.
2. Evaluation: Determine the presence of ANNA-3 antibodies by
comparing the fluorescence intensity of patient samples to the
controls.
3. Titer Determination: The titer is the highest dilution that still
shows positive fluorescence.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Positive Control: Ensure that the positive control shows
adequate fluorescence at each run.
2. Negative Control: Confirm that the negative control shows no
fluorescence.
3. Reproducibility: Repeat testing on a different day or with
different aliquots if necessary to confirm results.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Documentation: Record all observations and determine the
titer of ANNA-3 in the laboratory information system (LIS).
2. Verification: A senior technologist or supervisor should verify
the recorded results.
3. Notification: Communicate any critical or unexpected findings
to the ordering physician promptly as per laboratory policy.
8. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Negative: No fluorescence at a dilution of 1:10.
• Positive: Any visible fluorescence at or above a dilution of 1:10.
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Proper handling and storage of specimens and reagents are
critical for accurate results.
• Visual evaluation of fluorescence intensity inherently contains
some subjectiveness and requires experienced personnel.
10. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions for antibodies and secondary antibody
conjugates.
• Relevant instructional materials and published guidelines on
ANNA-3 detection and titer interpretation.
By following this SOP, consistency, accuracy, and reliability in testing
for ANNA-3 in spinal fluid will be maintained, ensuring high-quality
laboratory results.
