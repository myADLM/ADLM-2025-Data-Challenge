Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for ANTINEUTROPHIL
CYTOPLASMIC ANTIBODIES (ANCA), SERUM
1. PURPOSE To outline the procedures for performing the
Antineutrophil Cytoplasmic Antibodies (ANCA) test on serum
samples, ensuring consistent, accurate, and reliable results.
2. SCOPE This protocol applies to laboratory personnel trained and
authorized to conduct ANCA testing using indirect
immunofluorescence (IIF).
3. RESPONSIBILITY Designated laboratory personnel are
responsible for performing ANCA testing, documenting results, and
taking appropriate action when results are outside defined limits.
Supervisors are responsible for ensuring compliance with this SOP
and addressing any issues that arise.
4. DEFINITION Antineutrophil Cytoplasmic Antibodies (ANCA) are
autoantibodies directed against antigens in the cytoplasm of
neutrophils. ANCA testing is used predominantly in the diagnosis and
management of systemic vasculitis.
5. PRINCIPLE The ANCA test is performed using indirect
immunofluorescence, where patient serum is incubated with a
substrate of human neutrophils fixed on a slide. If ANCA is present, it
will bind to the neutrophil components and can be visualized with the
use of a fluorescent anti-human IgG conjugate.
6. SPECIMEN Preferred/Acceptable:
• Serum obtained from a blood sample collected in a serum
separator tube (SST).
• Serum should be separated from the clot and tested within 48
hours. If testing is delayed, store serum at 2-8°C for up to 72
hours or freeze at -20°C or below for longer storage.
Unacceptable:
• Hemolyzed, icteric, or lipemic samples.
• Samples not properly labeled or without collection date/time.
• Samples arriving at the lab more than 72 hours after collection if
stored at 2-8°C or showing compromised storage conditions.
7. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Indirect Immunofluorescence (IIF) microscope
• Slides with fixed human neutrophils
• Fluorescent-labeled anti-human IgG conjugate
• Wash buffers (PBS or equivalent)
• Mounting medium
• Positive and negative control sera
• Appropriate pipettes and tips
8. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation
1. Bring all reagents and serum samples to room temperature
before use.
2. Prepare wash buffer and mounting medium according to
manufacturer's instructions.
B) Test Setup
1. Label slides with patient identification and control sera.
2. Apply an appropriate amount of patient serum and control sera
to designated wells on the slide.
3. Incubate the slide at room temperature for 30 minutes in a
humid chamber.
4. Rinse the slides gently with wash buffer to remove unbound
antibodies.
5. Immerse the slides in fresh wash buffer for 5 minutes with
gentle agitation.
6. Repeat the wash step twice for a total of three washes.
C) Detection
1. Apply an appropriate volume of fluorescent-labeled anti-human
IgG conjugate to each well.
2. Incubate at room temperature for 30 minutes in a humid
chamber.
3. Repeat the wash procedure as described in the test setup to
remove unbound conjugate.
D) Observation
1. Apply a drop of mounting medium to each well and coverslip
the slides.
2. Examine the slides under an indirect immunofluorescence
microscope at 400x magnification.
3. Interpret results based on the fluorescence pattern observed:
◦ Cytoplasmic ANCA (c-ANCA) shows a granular cytoplasmic
staining pattern.
◦ Perinuclear ANCA (p-ANCA) shows a perinuclear staining
pattern.
◦ Negative controls should exhibit no fluorescence.
9. INTERPRETATION AND QUALITY CONTROL
1. Compare patient results to positive and negative controls to
ensure validity.
2. Each run must include both a positive and a negative control.
3. If controls do not perform as expected, all tests within the run
must be invalidated, and the test repeated.
10. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Document the ANCA pattern and any relevant observations.
2. Report results as either c-ANCA positive, p-ANCA positive, or
ANCA negative.
3. Refer to site-specific reporting guidelines for entering results
into the laboratory information system (LIS).

procedures to maintain result integrity.

results, controls, maintenance, and corrective actions, following the
laboratory's documentation protocol.
