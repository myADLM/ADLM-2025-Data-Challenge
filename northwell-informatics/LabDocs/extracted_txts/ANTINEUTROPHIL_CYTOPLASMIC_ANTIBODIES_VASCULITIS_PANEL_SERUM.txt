Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Antineutrophil Cytoplasmic Antibodies (ANCA)
Vasculitis Panel, Serum
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this procedure is to outline the
process involved in the analytical phase of generating results
for the Antineutrophil Cytoplasmic Antibodies (ANCA) Vasculitis
Panel, Serum. This panel includes testing for the presence of
cytoplasmic ANCA (c-ANCA), perinuclear ANCA (p-ANCA), and
other related autoantibodies that are crucial for diagnosing
vasculitis.
Responsibility:
Designated staff members are responsible for following this
procedure to ensure the accurate and timely analysis of ANCA test
results. It is the responsibility of all laboratory personnel to identify
any issues during the testing process and report them to a
supervisor.
1. DEFINITIONS
• c-ANCA (Cytoplasmic ANCA): ANCA with a cytoplasmic staining
pattern generally associated with Proteinase 3 (PR3) autoantigen.
• p-ANCA (Perinuclear ANCA): ANCA with a perinuclear staining
pattern often associated with myeloperoxidase (MPO).
• Indirect Immunofluorescence (IIF): A method used to detect
antibodies by incubating serum with ethanol-fixed neutrophils and
visualizing binding with a fluorescent microscope.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Fluorescence microscope
• Slide incubator
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Centrifuge
• Incubator
Reagents:
• Ethanol-fixed human neutrophil slides
• Secondary fluorescent-labeled antibody
• PBS (Phosphate buffered saline)
• Mounting medium with DAPI or other suitable counterstain
• Positive and negative control sera
Supplies:
• Glass slides
• Coverslips
• Labeling materials
1. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation:
1. Centrifuge serum samples at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes to
separate the serum if not already done.
2. Aliquot serum samples appropriately and label. Store
samples at -20°C if not immediately tested.
B. Indirect Immunofluorescence (IIF) for ANCA Screening:
1. Rehydrate ethanol-fixed neutrophil slides by placing them in
PBS for 5 minutes.
2. Apply serum samples to the wells of the rehydrated slides,
ensuring you include positive and negative controls.
3. Incubate slides in a moist chamber at room temperature for 30
minutes.
4. Wash slides in PBS for 2 x 5 minutes to remove unbound
antibodies.
5. Apply secondary fluorescent-labeled antibody to the wells
of the slide.
6. Incubate slides in a moist chamber at room temperature for an
additional 30 minutes.
7. Wash slides in PBS for 2 x 5 minutes and then rinse in distilled
water.
8. Mount coverslips onto slides using mounting medium and
allow to dry briefly.
C. Microscopy and Result Documentation:
1. Examine slides under a fluorescence microscope at 20x or
40x magnification.
2. Identify ANCA staining patterns: c-ANCA shows cytoplasmic
granular staining, p-ANCA shows perinuclear staining.
3. Record results for each sample as c-ANCA positive, p-ANCA
positive, or ANCA negative.
4. Document any observations of atypical patterns and correlate
with clinical data if available.
D. Reporting Results:
1. Enter results into the LIS (Laboratory Information System).
2. Verify and review results by a designated technologist or
supervisor.
3. Issue final reports to the requesting clinician, including
interpretation of results.
4. QUALITY CONTROL:
5. Perform QC testing with every batch: Include positive and
negative controls to ensure reagent and slide performance.
6. Document QC results: Use QC logs to document the
performance and any corrective actions if controls fail.
7. Regular calibration: Ensure the fluorescence microscope is
calibrated regularly.
8. REFERENCE INTERVALS:
• c-ANCA: Negative
• p-ANCA: Negative
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
• False positives/negatives in ANCA titers: Be aware of factors such
as sample handling and interference by other autoantibodies.
• Subjectivity in IIF interpretation: Results depend on the
experience and discernment of the technologist.
