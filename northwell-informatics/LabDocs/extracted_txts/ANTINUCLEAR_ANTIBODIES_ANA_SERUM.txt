1. PURPOSE
To provide accurate and reliable results for the detection of
Antinuclear Antibodies (ANA) in human serum using the Indirect
Immunofluorescence Assay (IFA) method.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing the
analytical procedure, ensuring quality control, and documenting
results accurately as outlined in this procedure.
1. DEFINITIONS
ANA: Antinuclear Antibodies are autoantibodies that target structures
within the nucleus of a cell, and their presence is often associated
with autoimmune diseases.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Acceptable Specimens:
• Serum obtained from clotted blood samples collected in red-top or
serum separator tubes (SST).
• Volume: Minimum 0.5 mL serum.
• Specimen storage: Refrigerate at 2-8°C if testing within 48 hours;
for longer storage, freeze at -20°C or below.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or grossly contaminated samples.
• Serum specimens older than 48 hours if stored at 2-8°C, or if
improperly stored.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Fluorescence Microscope
• Microtiter plates specific for ANA IFA
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Centrifuge
• Incubator
Reagents:
• ANA IFA kits (including positive and negative controls)
• PBS (Phosphate Buffered Saline) wash buffer
• Mounting medium
Supplies:
• Slides, cover slips
• Disposable gloves and lab coats
• Absorbent wipes
1. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Warm all reagents and samples to room temperature before
starting the assay.
2. Label slides appropriately with patient identifiers.
Assay Procedure:
1. Apply patient serum and controls to the appropriate wells on the
microtiter plate.
2. Incubate the plate in a humidified chamber at the temperature
and time specified in the kit insert (typically 30 minutes at room
temperature).
3. Wash the slides thoroughly with PBS buffer to remove unbound
antibodies.
4. Apply the fluorescent conjugated secondary antibody to each
well and incubate in a humidified chamber (typically 30 minutes
at room temperature).
5. Wash slides again with PBS to remove unbound secondary
antibodies.
6. Mount slides with mounting medium and cover slip.
Microscopy:
1. Analyze the slides under the fluorescence microscope at the
appropriate magnification.
2. Compare the fluorescence patterns of patient samples to that of
the positive and negative controls.
3. Document the observed fluorescence patterns and titer levels.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run both positive and negative controls with each batch of patient
samples.
• Ensure that control results fall within the expected ranges before
validating patient results.
• Document all quality control results in the appropriate log.
1. INTERPRETATION AND REPORTING OF RESULTS
Fluorescence Patterns:
• Positive: Presence of specific nuclear fluorescence patterns (e.g.,
homogeneous, speckled, nucleolar, centromere).
• Negative: No detectable nuclear fluorescence.
Titers:
• Report titers as the highest dilution at which fluorescence is
observed.
Documentation:
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Verify and review results before releasing them.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• ANA IFA is a semi-quantitative assay that may show variability in
fluorescence interpretation.
• Cross-reactivity with other autoantibodies may occur.
• Proper handling and preparation of specimens are critical to avoid
false results.
