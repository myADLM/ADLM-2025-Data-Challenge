STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP)
Analytical Phase for Generating Results for
Antinuclear Antibodies (ANA), HEP-2 Substrate, IgG,
Serum
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the detection and
quantification of antinuclear antibodies (ANA) in serum using the
HEP-2 substrate and IgG. The protocol ensures reliable and
reproducible results that are crucial for the diagnosis of autoimmune
diseases.
Responsibilities:
• Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for the execution
and documentation of the procedure.
• Laboratory supervisors are responsible for overseeing the
process, ensuring compliance, and addressing any discrepancies.
2. DEFINITION
Antinuclear Antibodies (ANA): Autoantibodies that target substances
within the nucleus of cells. HEP-2 cells: Human epithelial cells used
as substrates for detecting ANA. IgG: Immunoglobulin G, a type of
antibody. Serum: Plasma from which the clotting proteins have been
removed.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Serum
• Specimen Volume: Minimum 1 mL
• Collection: Collect serum in a red-top tube (plain) or serum
separator tube (SST).
• Specimen Handling: Allow the blood to clot at room temperature
for 30 minutes and centrifuge for 10 minutes at 1500 x g.
Immediately separate the serum from the clot and store at 2-8°C
for up to 72 hours. For longer storage, freeze at -20°C or below.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• HEP-2 Slides (commercially available)
• Dark field fluorescence microscope
• PBS (Phosphate Buffered Saline) wash buffer
• Tween 20
• Secondary antibody (anti-human IgG with Fluorescein
isothiocyanate, FITC label)
• Mounting medium
• Cover slips
• Timer
• Humidity chamber
• Positive and Negative control sera
• Disposable pipette tips
• Gloves and Lab coat
5. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation:
1. Allow all reagents and specimens to reach room temperature.
2. Prepare wash buffer (PBS with 0.05% Tween 20).
B) Test Procedure:
1. Preparation of HEP-2 Slides:
◦ Place HEP-2 substrate slides on a flat surface in a humidity
chamber.
2. Application of Control and Patient Sera:
◦ Dilute patient serum (1:40) in PBS.
◦ Apply 20 μL of diluted patient serum, positive control serum,
and negative control serum to designated wells on the
HEP-2 slide.
◦ Incubate in the humidity chamber at room temperature for
30 minutes.
3. Washing:
◦ Rinse slides gently but thoroughly in wash buffer for 5
minutes. Repeat for a total of three washes.
4. Application of Secondary Antibody:
◦ Apply 20 μL of FITC-labeled anti-human IgG secondary
antibody to each well.
◦ Incubate in the humidity chamber in the dark for 30 minutes
at room temperature.
5. Washing:
◦ Repeat the washing step three times as described above.
6. Mounting:
◦ Apply a drop of mounting medium to each well and cover
with a cover slip.
C) Microscopy:
1. Examination:
◦ Examine the slides using a fluorescence microscope at
400x magnification.
◦ Identify the presence of fluorescence which indicates the
presence of ANA.
◦ Record the pattern of fluorescence if present (e.g.,
homogeneous, speckled, nucleolar, centromere).
D) Documentation:
1. Logging Results:
◦ Record the patient ID, dilution, fluorescence pattern, and
intensity (negative, 1+, 2+, 3+, 4+) in the ANA result
logbook.
◦ Compare findings with positive and negative control results.
2. Quality Control:
◦ Ensure controls give expected outcomes: Positive control
shows defined fluorescence, while the negative control
shows no or minimal fluorescence.
◦ Document all control results and daily equipment checks.
◦ If controls fail, repeat the test and troubleshoot as
necessary.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
Results are to be documented in the laboratory information system
(LIS) by the performing technologist. A report is generated from the
LIS, and results are reviewed and verified.
• Negative: No specific fluorescence or staining observed.
• Positive: Specific fluorescence pattern observed and noted
regarding intensity and type.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform quality control checks with known positive and negative
sera at the start of each day of testing.
• Document all quality control results in the QC log.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the manufacturer's insert for specific limitations and
interference information.
9. REFERENCES
Include all relevant literature and package inserts that provide
additional information regarding the HEP-2 substrate slides,
fluorescent microscope procedure, and secondary antibodies.
• Manufacturer’s package insert for HEP-2 slides.
• Manufacturer’s package insert for FITC-labeled anti-human IgG.
10. REVIEW AND REVISION
This procedure is to be reviewed annually or upon significant
changes in methodology, regulations, or equipment.
By ensuring adherence to this protocol, the laboratory maintains high
standards for the detection of antinuclear antibodies in serum,
providing essential information for the diagnosis and monitoring of
autoimmune diseases.
