Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for ANTINUCLEAR ANTIBODY
(ANA) SCREEN W/ REFLEX ENA AND DSDNA
1. PURPOSE
To provide a consistent and standardized procedure for the detection
of antinuclear antibodies (ANA) and, if warranted, reflex testing for
extractable nuclear antibodies (ENA) and double-stranded DNA
(dsDNA) antibodies. The results of these tests aid in the diagnosis of
autoimmune disorders.
1. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all trained personnel conducting ANA
screening and subsequent reflex testing for ENA and dsDNA in the
laboratory.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
All designated laboratory personnel are responsible for the
adherence to this SOP and for the accurate performance of the ANA
test including any subsequent reflex testing. It is the responsibility of
the laboratory supervisor to ensure that all staff are properly trained
and competent in the procedures.
1. SPECIMEN
4.1 Acceptable Specimen:
• Serum: At least 1 mL of serum is required. Collect blood in a red-
top or serum separator tube (SST).
• The serum must be separated from the cells within 2 hours of
collection by centrifugation.
4.2 Unacceptable Specimen:
• Severely hemolyzed, lipemic or icteric samples.
• Specimens in inappropriate collection containers.
• Specimens that are improperly labeled or have missing collection
date/time.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
◦ Immunofluorescence microscope
◦ ANA HEp-2 cell substrates (kits)
◦ PBS (phosphate-buffered saline)
◦ Fluorescein-conjugated anti-human IgG
◦ Control sera (positive and negative)
◦ Coverslips and slide staining chambers
◦ Mounting medium and slides
◦ High-quality microcentrifuge for sample preparation
◦ Dedicated refrigerated storage for reagents and samples
◦ Serum stored at 2-8°C (short-term) or below -20°C (long-
term)
2. PROCEDURE
6.1 ANA Screen
6.1.1 Preparation:
• Prepare slide staining chambers with PBS.
• Bring all reagents to room temperature.
6.1.2 Staining:
• In a humid chamber, add patient serum (diluted according to kit
instructions) to the ANA HEp-2 cell substrate slides.
• Incubate slides for the period specified by the kit manufacturer,
typically 30 minutes at room temperature.
• Rinse the slides with PBS and then wash in PBS for 5 minutes (3
changes).
• Add fluorescein-conjugated anti-human IgG to the slides and
incubate in a humid chamber for the period specified by the kit
manufacturer, typically 30 minutes at room temperature in the
dark.
• Rinse with PBS followed by washing in PBS for 5 minutes (3
changes).
• Mount the slides using an appropriate anti-fade mounting medium
and add coverslips.
6.1.3 Microscopy:
• Examine slides under immunofluorescence microscope at 400x
magnification.
• Assess for the presence of fluorescence indicating positive ANA.
• Record and grade fluorescence patterns (e.g., homogeneous,
speckled, nucleolar).
6.2 Reflex Testing for ENA and dsDNA
6.2.1 Criteria for Reflex Testing:
• Reflex testing is performed for samples with a positive ANA
screen.
6.2.2 ENA Panel:
• Use an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or
immunoblot assay kit specific for ENA antibodies.
• Follow manufacturer’s instructions for the assay procedure.
• Report results as positive or negative for specific ENA antibodies
(e.g., Anti-Sm, Anti-RNP, Anti-SSA/Ro, Anti-SSB/La, Anti-Scl-70,
and Anti-Jo-1).
6.2.3 dsDNA Antibody Testing:
• Use an ELISA or Crithidia luciliae indirect immunofluorescence
assay (CL-IFA) specific for dsDNA antibodies.
• Follow manufacturer’s instructions for the assay procedure.
• Report results as positive or negative for anti-dsDNA antibodies.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
7.1 ANA Screen:
• Include both positive and negative controls in each run.
• Document and review control results before reporting patient
results.
7.2 Reflex Tests:
• Perform quality control according to manufacturer’s instructions
for both ENA and dsDNA assays.
• Document and review control results before reporting patient
results.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
8.1 ANA Screen:
• Report as "Positive" or "Negative".
• Include pattern and titre if positive (e.g., "Positive, homogeneous
pattern, 1:160 titre"). 8.2 Reflex Tests:
• ENA Panel and dsDNA results should be reported as “Positive” or
“Negative” with specific antibody identification where applicable.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the manufacturer’s instructions for limitations related to
specific assays and reagent kits used.
