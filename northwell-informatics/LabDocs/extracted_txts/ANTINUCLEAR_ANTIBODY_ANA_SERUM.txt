Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Antinuclear Antibody (ANA), Serum
1. PURPOSE
To outline the standardized procedure for the analytical phase of
generating results for Antinuclear Antibody (ANA) testing on serum
samples. The goal is to ensure accurate, reliable, and reproducible
results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
Laboratory technologists are responsible for performing ANA testing
following this procedure accurately. Supervisors are responsible for
ensuring adherence to the procedure and addressing any deviations.
3. SPECIMENS
• Preferred/Acceptable Specimens:
◦ Serum sample collected in a red-top tube or serum separator
tube (SST).
◦ Samples should be clear and free of hemolysis.
◦ Collected samples should be processed within 2 hours of
collection and stored at 2-8°C if not analyzed immediately.
• Unacceptable Specimens:
◦ Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
◦ Samples not properly labeled with patient information.
◦ Samples stored at room temperature for more than 8 hours
before processing.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Equipment:
◦ Immunofluorescence Microscope
◦ Rotator
◦ Pipettes (calibrated) and tips
◦ Centrifuge
• Reagents/Supplies:
◦ ANA substrate slides (commercially available kit)
◦ PBS (Phosphate-buffered saline), pH 7.2-7.4
◦ Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled anti-human IgG
◦ Mounting medium
◦ Coverslips
◦ Control samples (Positive and Negative)
◦ Distilled water
◦ ANA substrate slide humidity chamber
5. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation:
1. Allow all reagents to reach room temperature before starting
the assay.
2. Thaw positive and negative control sera if stored at -20°C.
3. Prepare PBS wash buffer and other necessary solutions as per
manufacturer’s instructions.
B) Sample Processing:
1. Centrifuge the serum sample at 1500-2000 rpm for 10 minutes
if needed.
2. Decant the serum into a clean secondary tube ensuring no cell
contamination.
C) ANA Slide Preparation:
1. Label each well of the ANA substrate slide with the sample or
control identifiers.
2. Add 20 µL of serum (patient sample, positive control, negative
control) to the designated wells on the ANA substrate slide.
3. Place the slide into a humidity chamber and incubate at room
temperature for 30 minutes.
D) Washing:
1. After incubation, gently rinse the slides by immersing them in
PBS solution.
2. Agitate gently to remove excess serum.
3. Perform three consecutive washes with PBS, each for about 5
minutes.
E) Staining:
1. Add 20 µL of FITC-conjugated anti-human IgG to each well and
incubate in the dark at room temperature for 30 minutes in the
humidity chamber.
2. Repeat the PBS washing process as described in section D.
F) Mounting and Visualization:
1. Add 2-3 drops of mounting medium to the center of the slide
avoiding bubbles.
2. Carefully place coverslip over the mounts to avoid trapping air
bubbles.
3. Examine the slides immediately using an immunofluorescence
microscope equipped with the appropriate filters.
6. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
1. Examine positive and negative controls first to ensure the assay
is working correctly.
2. Assess patient samples after validating controls.
3. Evaluate the staining pattern and intensity for each sample.
Typical ANA patterns include Homogeneous, Speckled,
Nucleolar, Centromere, and Cytoplasmic staining.
◦ Positive result: Any discernible fluorescence pattern
observed under the microscope.
◦ Negative result: No visible fluorescence or staining pattern.
4. Document the observed pattern and intensity for each sample.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include positive and negative controls in each run to validate the
test results.
• Observe microscope calibration and record daily.
• Regularly check all equipment and reagents for proper
functioning, particularly before starting the assay.
• Document any deviations or issues encountered during the test
run and inform the supervisor.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS) along
with the observed ANA pattern.
• Verify results with a second technologist if the fluorescence
patterns are ambiguous or unexpected.
• Critical results should be immediately reported to the requesting
clinician following the laboratory’s protocol for critical values
notification.

10. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the manufacturer’s instructions and technical bulletins for
limitations of the ANA testing methodology. Potential factors affecting
results include specimen quality, reagent stability, and equipment
calibration.
