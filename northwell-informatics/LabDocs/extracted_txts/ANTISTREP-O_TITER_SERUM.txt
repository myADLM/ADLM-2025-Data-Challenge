Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
ASO Titer Testing
1. PURPOSE
To outline the steps and ensure proper procedures for the analysis of
Anti-Streptolysin O (ASO) Titer in serum samples, ensuring
consistent and accurate results.
Responsibility:
• Designated personnel are responsible for performing the test,
maintaining instruments, documenting results, and taking
corrective actions if necessary.
• Supervisors are responsible for overseeing test accuracy and
compliance.
2. DEFINITION
Anti-Streptolysin O (ASO) Titer is performed to detect antibodies
against Streptolysin O produced by Group A Streptococcus
(Streptococcus pyogenes), which can indicate a recent streptococcal
infection.
3. PROCEDURE
Specimen Collection and Stability:
• Preferred Specimen: Serum separated from a clotted blood
sample.
• Collection Tubes: SST (serum separator tube) or plain red-top
tube.
• Stability: Separated serum is stable for up to 7 days refrigerated
(2-8°C) or longer when frozen (-20°C or lower).
Equipment, Reagents and Supplies:
• ASO Assay Kit (e.g., Latex Agglutination method)
• Control Sera (Positive and Negative Controls)
• Pipettes and Tips
• Test Tubes
• Timer
• Plate Reader (if using automated kit)
• Incubator (specific to kit requirements)
• Gloves, Lab Coat, Eye Protection (PPE)
Procedure:
1. Reagent Preparation:
◦ Remove ASO reagent and serum samples from storage and
allow them to come to room temperature.
◦ Prepare control sera and check for expected agglutination
before beginning the test.
2. Sample Preparation:
◦ Ensure serum samples are free of particulates and
hemolysis.
◦ Mix serum samples gently before pipetting to ensure
homogeneity.
3. Testing Procedure:
Manual Latex Agglutination Method:
1. Label the required number of test tubes or reaction cards for
test samples and controls.
2. Add a predetermined volume (usually 50µL) of serum to each
tube or designated well.
3. Add an equal volume (50µL) of ASO latex reagent to each tube/
well.
4. Mix gently by rotating or shaking according to the kit's
instructions.
5. Incubate at room temperature for 2–5 minutes as specified by
the assay kit.
6. Observe for agglutination against a white background under
appropriate lighting conditions.
Automation (if used):
• Follow equipment-specific protocols for loading samples and
reagents.
• Observe plate reader instructions for setting incubation times and
reading absorbance values.
1. Quality Control:
◦ Run Positive and Negative Controls with each batch of
samples.
◦ Record results of controls to ensure they are within
acceptable ranges before proceeding with patient sample
results.
◦ If controls do not perform as expected, investigate potential
issues (reagent quality, procedural errors) and repeat the
control testing.
5. Calculation and Interpretation of Results:
• Positive Result: Visible agglutination indicating the presence of
ASO antibodies.
• Negative Result: No visible agglutination.
• Titer determination (if applicable): Serial dilutions of samples
showing agglutination until no visible agglutination determines the
ASO titer.
6. Documentation and Reporting:
• Record results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Ensure all entries include test date, time, technologist’s initials,
and any observations or notes.
• Report results according to site-specific guidelines, including
critical value notification procedures.
7. Maintenance and Calibration:
• Regularly check and maintain equipment according to
manufacturer recommendations.
• Verify calibration status and perform routine maintenance of
incubators, plate readers, and other relevant instruments.
• Document maintenance activities and actions taken in
maintenance logs.
8. Troubleshooting and Corrective Actions:
• If unexpected results or control failures occur, re-evaluate the test
protocol adherence, check reagent integrity, and verify instrument
functionality.
• Report persistent issues to a supervisor and follow corrective
action protocols.
• Document issues, investigation steps, and corrective actions
taken.
9. Safety Precautions:
• Wear appropriate PPE (lab coat, gloves, eye protection).
• Handle all specimens as potentially infectious.
• Dispose of biohazardous waste per established safety protocols.
10. References:
• Refer to the package insert and assay manufacturer's instructions
for detailed reagent and procedural information.
• Adhere to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI)
guidelines as relevant.
This SOP should be reviewed and amended, if necessary, regularly
to ensure adherence to current best practices and regulatory
requirements. Proper training should be provided to all staff
performing the ASO Titer test to ensure compliance with this
procedure.
