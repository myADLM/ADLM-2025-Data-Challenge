Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for ANTITHROMBIN
ACTIVITY, BLOOD
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedure for
the determination of antithrombin activity in blood samples, ensuring
accurate and reliable results while adhering to all applicable
regulations and quality standards.
2. PRINCIPLE Antithrombin is a major physiological inhibitor of
coagulation, and its activity can be assessed by measuring its ability
to inhibit factor Xa or factor IIa (thrombin) in the presence of heparin.
This procedure involves the measurement of residual factor Xa after
incubation with patient plasma and standardized heparin.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY A. Specimen
Collection:
• Preferred specimens: Trisodium citrate anticoagulated plasma
(light blue top tube).
• Specimen volume: Minimum of 1 mL plasma.
• Specimen should be processed within 4 hours of collection.
B. Specimen Handling and Transport:
• Centrifuge the blood collection tube at 1500 x g for 15 minutes at
room temperature within one hour of collection to obtain platelet-
poor plasma.
• Carefully aliquot the plasma into a plastic transport tube and label
with the patient identification information and date/time of
collection.
• Transport the aliquoted plasma on ice to the laboratory
immediately.
• If transport within 4 hours is not possible, freeze the plasma at
-20°C or lower. Do not exceed one freeze-thaw cycle.
C. Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric specimens.
• Specimens collected in non-citrate anticoagulants.
• Specimens that have been thawed more than once.
• Specimens received not according to the acceptable transport/
storage conditions.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES A. Equipment:
• Mechanical or microplate reader capable of measuring
absorbance at specific wavelengths (405 nm).
• Precision pipettes and tips.
• Centrifuge.
• Water bath or incubator set to 37°C.
• Calibrated Heparin Co-analyzer or equivalent instrument.
B. Reagents:
• Antithrombin activity reagent kits, including:
◦ Factor Xa or IIa substrate (chromogenic peptide substrate).
◦ Standardized heparin solution.
◦ Factor Xa/IIa stock solution.
◦ Stop solution (e.g., acetic acid).
• Calibrators and controls (negative and positive).
• Deionized or distilled water.
5. PROCEDURE A. Reagent Preparation:
• Prepare all reagents according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
• Ensure reagents are equilibrated to room temperature before use.
B. Calibration:
• Prepare standard calibration curves using manufacturer-supplied
calibrators.
• Run calibrators at the beginning of each testing batch.
• Verify calculations and ensure linearity and expected recovery of
control samples.
C. Quality Control:
• Run positive and negative controls with each batch of patient
samples.
• Record and evaluate QC results to determine acceptance.
D. Assay Procedure:
1. Label test tubes or microplate wells for standards, controls, and
patient samples.
2. Pipette 50 μL of plasma (standard/control/patient) to each well
or test tube.
3. Add 50 μL of heparin solution to each well/tube and vortex
briefly.
4. Incubate at 37°C for 1 minute.
5. Add 50 μL of factor Xa/IIa solution to each well/tube.
6. Incubate at 37°C for 3-5 minutes (according to kit instructions).
7. Add 100 μL of chromogenic substrate to each well/tube.
8. Incubate at 37°C for 5 minutes.
9. Add 50 μL of stop solution to each well/tube.
10. Measure absorbance at 405 nm using a microplate reader.
E. Calculation of Results:
• Calculate the antithrombin activity (%) for each sample using the
calibration curve data.
• Verify that all controls are within acceptable limits before reporting
patient results.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
• Report antithrombin activity as a percentage.
• Record all pertinent data including patient identification,
absorbance readings, calculated results, and technician's initials.
• Verify results according to laboratory protocols before reporting
them to the Electronic Laboratory Information System (LIS).
7. REFERENCE INTERVALS:
• Normal range for antithrombin activity: 83-128% (may vary per
laboratory; refer to local reference values).
8. CRITICAL VALUES AND REFERENCE LIMITATIONS:
• Values below 50% may be indicative of severe antithrombin
deficiency and clinicians should be alerted immediately.
• Refer to the reagent manufacturer's insert for any additional
limitations of the method.
9. QUALITY CONTROL AND TROUBLESHOOTING:
• Perform regular maintenance and calibration of laboratory
equipment.
• Consult the manufacturer’s troubleshooting guide if unexpected
results occur.
• Properly document any procedural deviations or anomalies.
10. REFERENCES:
• Specific manufacturer’s package insert and technical bulletins.
• Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines.
• Internal quality management and verification protocols.
11. REVIEW AND APPROVAL:
• This SOP was reviewed and approved on [Date] by [Name and
Title].
12. DOCUMENTATION:
• Ensure that all steps, calculations, and reportings are
documented according to laboratory standards.
This procedure ensures accurate and reliable determination of
antithrombin activity as part of a comprehensive thrombophilia
evaluation. Proper adherence to this SOP will ensure high-quality
results and patient safety.
