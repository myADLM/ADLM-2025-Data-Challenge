ANTITHROMBIN ACTIVITY, PLASMA Standard Operating
Procedure (SOP)
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the accurate and efficient
analysis of Antithrombin Activity in plasma samples within the
laboratory. This ensures consistent, reliable results that adhere to
regulatory standards.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing and
documenting all steps of the antithrombin activity assay as outlined in
this procedure. It is the responsibility of all staff to identify any
deficiencies that may affect test results and to bring them to the
attention of a supervisor.
2. DEFINITION
Antithrombin is a protein in the blood that inhibits blood coagulation
by neutralizing thrombin and other clotting factors. Measurement of
antithrombin activity is important in assessing individuals for
coagulation disorders.
3. PROCEDURE
Specimen Requirements:
Preferred:
• Plasma collected in sodium citrate tube (light blue top).
Specimen Stability:
• Centrifuge sample within 2 hours of collection to separate plasma.
• Plasma should be frozen at -20°C or colder if testing is not
immediate and remains stable for up to 6 months when frozen.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Grossly hemolyzed samples
• Improperly labeled specimens
• Specimens collected in non-citrate tubes
Equipment and Reagents:
• CliniBio Antithrombin Activity Assay Kit
• Microplate reader capable of measuring absorbance at 405 nm
• 96-well microplates
• Calibrated laboratory pipettes
• Timer
• Sodium citrate tubes (light blue top)
• Quality control material: Normal and abnormal control plasmas
Calibration and Quality Control:
• Calibrate the microplate reader as needed according to the
manufacturer’s specifications.
• Run controls at the beginning, middle, and end of each batch of
samples. Controls must fall within manufacturer-specified ranges.
• Document all quality control results and take corrective actions if
controls are out of range.
Procedure Steps:
1. Preparation:
◦ Thaw frozen plasma samples at room temperature.
◦ Prepare reagents and working solutions as specified in the
CliniBio Antithrombin Activity Assay Kit insert.
2. Sample and Reagent Addition:
◦ Pipette 50 µL of sample plasma into each well.
◦ Add 50 µL of antithrombin buffer reagent to each well.
◦ Incubate the plate at 37°C for 5 minutes.
3. Reaction Initiation:
◦ Add 50 µL of thrombin substrate solution to each well.
◦ Monitor the development of color continuously for 2 minutes
at 405 nm using the microplate reader.
4. Reading and Calculation:
◦ Record the absorbance values at 405 nm.
◦ Calculate antithrombin activity percentage using the
supplied calculation formula.
◦ Validate results using quality control material.
Reporting Results:
• Results are automatically transmitted to the LIS and reviewed by
the technologist for verification.
• Report values as percent (%) antithrombin activity.
• Critical values should be confirmed and reported following site-
specific guidelines.
Reference Intervals:
• Normal: 80-120%
• Refer to latest literature and kit insert for any updates.
Method Limitations: Refer to the CliniBio Antithrombin Activity
Assay kit insert for specific reagent limitations and interferences that
might affect the assay results.
Documentation and Record Keeping:
• Log specimens’ IDs, test results, quality control data, and any
deviations in a designated logbook or electronic system.
• Records must be maintained for compliance and auditing
purposes.
Safety and Compliance:
• Follow universal precautions while handling human specimens.
• Dispose of biohazard waste accordingly.

Review Cycle:
• This SOP will be reviewed annually to ensure compliance with
current regulations and standards.
By following this SOP, laboratory personnel will be able to conduct
antithrombin activity assays proficiently, ensuring reliability and
accuracy in test results.
