Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Antithrombin Activity, with
Reflex to Antithrombin Antigen, Plasma
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this protocol is to outline the procedures to accurately
measure the antithrombin activity in plasma samples, and as a reflex,
to measure antithrombin antigen levels if indicated by abnormal
antithrombin activity results. This will ensure the reliability and
reproducibility of test results.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of all laboratory personnel performing this
procedure to be adequately trained and to follow this SOP accurately.
Supervisors are responsible for ensuring that staff comply with this
SOP.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/Acceptable:
• Plasma collected in a sodium citrate tube (blue top).
• Ensure correct blood-to-anticoagulant ratio (9:1).
• Samples should be processed within 4 hours of collection if stored
at room temperature. If delayed, freeze at -20°C.
Unacceptable:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
• Samples with incorrect blood-to-anticoagulant ratio.
• Samples stored at room temperature for more than 4 hours and
not frozen.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• Clotting Time Analyzer
• Antithrombin activity assay kit (Chromogenic assay preferred)
• Antithrombin antigen assay kit (Immunoassay)
• Calibrators and QC materials
• Sodium citrate tubes (blue top)
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes and tips
• Timer
• Appropriate PPE
1. PROCEDURE
A) Antithrombin Activity Assay
1. Prepare plasma samples by centrifuging at 1500 x g for 15
minutes at room temperature.
2. Collect the supernatant plasma without disturbing the cell layer.
3. Prepare reagents, calibrators, and QC materials according to
the manufacturer's instructions.
4. Set up the Clotting Time Analyzer or other designated
instrument and run calibration.
5. Add appropriate volume of sample, reagent, and substrate to
respective wells or cuvettes as per kit instructions.
6. Incubate at specified temperature and time as indicated in the
assay kit manual.
7. Measure absorbance or other endpoint according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
8. Calculate antithrombin activity using the calibration curve.
B) Reflex to Antithrombin Antigen Assay (if indicated)
1. Determine the need for reflex testing based on predetermined
activity threshold (e.g., ≤50% antithrombin activity).
2. Follow steps 1-3 from the antithrombin activity assay to prepare
samples.
3. Prepare reagents, calibrators, and QC materials according to
the antigen assay kit instructions.
4. Add appropriate volume of antithrombin antigen reagents to
sample wells or cuvettes.
5. Follow specified incubation and washing steps as detailed in
the kit manual.
6. Measure absorbance or other endpoint at the specified
wavelength.
7. Calculate antithrombin antigen levels using the calibration
curve.
Documentation:
• Record all sample identifications, test dates, and operator initials
in the logbook.
• Document all calibration and QC results, including any corrective
actions taken if controls or calibrators fall outside of acceptable
ranges.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run quality control materials alongside patient samples as per
laboratory policy.
• If QC results are not within the acceptable range, do not report
patient results.
• Investigate and resolve QC issues, re-run affected samples, and
document corrective actions.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Report antithrombin activity results in percentage (%).
• If antithrombin activity is below the established threshold, conduct
reflex testing for antithrombin antigen levels.
• Report antithrombin antigen levels in mg/dL.
• Verify all results by a trained technologist before entering into the
LIS.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Antithrombin Activity: 80-120%
• Antithrombin Antigen: 23-39 mg/dL
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolysis, lipemia, and icterus may interfere with test results.
• Inaccurate blood-to-anticoagulant ratio can affect clotting tests.
• Improper storage of samples may degrade activity.
