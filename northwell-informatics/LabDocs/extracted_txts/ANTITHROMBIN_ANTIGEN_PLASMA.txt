STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP)
Title: Antithrombin Antigen, Plasma Analysis Procedure
1. PURPOSE To outline the procedure for the analysis of
Antithrombin Antigen in plasma samples to ensure accurate
and reliable results are generated for clinical evaluation.
2. SCOPE This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel involved in
the analysis of plasma Antithrombin Antigen levels.
3. RESPONSIBILITY Laboratory personnel are responsible for
complying with this SOP to ensure the proper handling and
analysis of samples. Supervisors are responsible for ensuring
staff follow the SOP and maintain records of all analyses
performed.
4. REAGENTS AND EQUIPMENT
• Antithrombin antigen assay kit (manufacturer-specific)
• Calibrators and controls.
• Micropipettes and tips.
• Centrifuge.
• Plasma samples.
• PPE (lab coat, gloves, safety goggles).
• Appropriate documentation materials.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND COLLECTION
• Preferred specimen: Plasma collected in sodium citrate
anticoagulant tubes.
• Specimens must be processed to plasma within 2 hours of
collection.
• Store plasma samples at -20°C if analysis is not performed
immediately.
• Ensure samples are free from hemolysis or clots.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Use control samples at the beginning and end of each batch to
ensure assay reliability.
• Two levels of controls (normal and abnormal) should be run with
each patient batch.
• Verify the calibration curve with each new reagent lot or monthly,
whichever occurs first.
• Ensure instrument maintenance is performed per manufacturer's
guidelines.
1. PROCEDURE i. Preparation
• Wear appropriate PPE.
• Obtain plasma samples and thaw if previously frozen. Ensure
they are at room temperature before beginning the assay.
• Prepare reagents according to the manufacturer's instructions.
• Prepare and dilute calibrators and controls as required.
ii. Sample Processing
1. Centrifuge plasma samples at 1500 rpm for 10 minutes to
remove any particulates.
2. Aliquot the clear supernatant to labeled microtubes.
3. Set up the assay plates/wells according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
4. Add calibrators, controls, and plasma samples to the assay
wells using micropipettes.
5. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for the incubation times
and temperatures.
6. Add the detection antibodies/enzyme substrate as per kit
instructions.
7. Measure absorbance or fluorescence using the appropriate
plate reader.
iii. Result Calculation
• Convert raw absorbance/fluorescence values to Antithrombin
Antigen levels using the established calibration curve.
• Ensure all control values are within acceptable ranges before
validation of patient results.
• If controls are out of range, troubleshoot as needed before
reporting patient results.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Verify results according to site-specific guidelines.
• Alert clinical staff of any critical values that require immediate
attention.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Ensure proper sample handling to avoid hemolysis or clotting
which can interfere with results.
• Refer to the assay kit insert for specific limitation details.
