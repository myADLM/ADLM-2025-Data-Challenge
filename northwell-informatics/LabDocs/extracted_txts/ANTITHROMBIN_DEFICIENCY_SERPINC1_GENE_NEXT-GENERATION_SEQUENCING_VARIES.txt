Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase for Generating Results for Antithrombin
Deficiency, SERPINC1 Gene, Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS)
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedures necessary for
the analytical phase of antithrombin deficiency testing involving the
SERPINC1 gene using next-generation sequencing (NGS). This SOP
ensures accurate, reliable, and timely results for diagnosing
antithrombin deficiency.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel performing NGS
for the SERPINC1 gene related to antithrombin deficiency.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the laboratory personnel to:
• Perform NGS data analysis following this SOP.
• Ensure the integrity and accuracy of the test results through
appropriate quality control measures.
• Report results accurately and in a timely manner.
• Bring any issues or anomalies to the attention of a supervisor.
• Document all procedures and results thoroughly.
4. DEFINITIONS
• Antithrombin Deficiency: A condition characterized by a
deficiency in antithrombin, leading to an increased risk of
thrombosis.
• SERPINC1 Gene: The gene encoding antithrombin, mutations of
which can cause antithrombin deficiency.
• Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS): A high-throughput method
used to determine the sequence of nucleotides in coding and non-
coding regions of a gene.
5. PROCEDURE
5.1. Sample Preparation:
• Ensure that the specimen has been properly collected, received,
and accessioned. The sample type typically required is peripheral
blood in an EDTA tube.
• Extract DNA using a standardized DNA extraction kit. Document
any deviations from the standard procedure.
5.2. Library Preparation:
• Quantify the extracted DNA using a fluorometer to ensure
sufficient starting material.
• Use a targeted enrichment protocol to prepare the library for the
SERPINC1 gene. This includes:
◦ Fragmentation of DNA.
◦ End repair, A-tailing, and adapter ligation.
◦ PCR amplification (if applicable).
◦ Quality assessment using a bioanalyzer or similar instrument.
5.3. Sequencing:
• Load the prepared library onto the specified NGS platform
according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
• Perform sequencing run following the manufacturer's instructions.
5.4. Data Analysis:
• Perform initial quality control (QC) checks on raw sequence data.
Parameters to assess include read quality, read length, and
overall yield.
• Align sequence data to the reference human genome sequence
(GRCh38/hg38).
• Identify variants using a validated bioinformatics pipeline. This
typically involves:
◦ Read alignment.
◦ Variant calling.
◦ Filtering based on quality metrics.
• Annotate identified variants using appropriate software tools.
5.5. Variants Interpretation:
• Review identified variants for quality and confirm the presence of
clinically significant variants in the SERPINC1 gene.
• Interpret the clinical significance of each variant based on current
scientific literature and mutation databases (e.g., ClinVar).
5.6. Quality Control:
• Include positive and negative control samples in each run to
ensure the reliability of the sequencing process.
• Document any discrepancies or anomalies observed during the
analysis and take corrective actions as necessary.
5.7. Reporting Results:
• Compile a comprehensive report detailing the identified variants,
their clinical significance, and any relevant interpretation.
• Review and approve the report by designated personnel.
• Communicate the results to the ordering healthcare provider
following laboratory guidelines and policies.
6. QUALITY ASSURANCE AND TROUBLESHOOTING:
• Verify instrument calibration and performance before each run.
• Document any instrument issues and notify the supervisor
immediately for any deviation or instrument failure.
• Use validated software tools and ensure regular updates to
maintain data analysis accuracy.
• Regularly participate in proficiency testing to ensure
methodological consistency and accuracy.
7. DOCUMENTATION:
• Maintain accurate and thorough records of all procedures, results,
quality control measures, and corrective actions taken.
• Ensure traceability by documenting all steps from sample
accessioning to reporting.
8. REFERENCES:
• Latest Peer-reviewed literature on Antithrombin Deficiency and
SERPINC1 gene.
• Manufacturer’s guidelines for NGS platforms and library
preparation kits.
• Institutional guidelines for molecular genetic testing.
9. REVIEW/REVISION HISTORY:
• Document control numbers, version history, and approval
information should be maintained up-to-date.
10. APPROVAL:
• Signatures from reviewing and approving personnel with dates to
ensure compliance.
By following this SOP, the laboratory will ensure consistent, accurate,
and reliable results for antithrombin deficiency testing involving the
SERPINC1 gene using next-generation sequencing.
