ANTITHROMBIN SUMMARY INTERPRETATION PROTOCOL
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedures for analyzing, interpreting, and reporting
ANTITHROMBIN activity/antigen and generating summary
interpretations in a CLIA-certified laboratory.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory staff are responsible for conducting
antithrombin assays, documenting results, and performing
subsequent interpretations.
• Supervisors must ensure that testing, interpretation, and reporting
are carried out per these procedures.
1. DEFINITION
ANTITHROMBIN is a serine protease inhibitor that plays a role in
inhibiting coagulation.
1. PROCEDURE
A) SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred Specimen: Citrate plasma (light blue top tube).
• Volume: Minimum of 1 mL of plasma.
• Handling: Specimen should be centrifuged (1500 x g for 15
minutes) and plasma separated within 1 hour of collection.
• Storage: Plasma can be stored at -20°C for short-term storage
(up to 2 weeks) or at -70°C for long-term storage.
B) EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
• Automated coagulation analyzer capable of performing
antithrombin assays.
• Reagents for antithrombin activity and antigen assays.
• Appropriate QC materials (normal and abnormal controls).
C) METHODS
1. Antithrombin Activity Assay:
• Ensure the analyzer is calibrated and QC is within acceptable
limits.
• Load the plasma sample onto the coagulation analyzer.
• Run the antithrombin activity assay as per the manufacturer's
instructions.
• Document the results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
2. Antithrombin Antigen Assay (if applicable):
• Ensure analyzer calibration and QC as per SOP.
• Load plasma sample as per analyzer specifications.
• Perform the antigen assay according to manufacturer’s
guidelines.
• Document results in the LIS.
D) CALCULATIONS AND INTERPRETATIONS
• Reference Ranges:
◦ Antithrombin Activity: 80-120% (<50% is suggestive of
antithrombin deficiency)
◦ Antithrombin Antigen: 70-130% (less than reference range
denotes type I deficiency; activity low antigen normal denotes
type II deficiency)
• Interpretation:
◦ Normal: Both activity and antigen within reference ranges.
◦ Type I Deficiency: Low activity with low antigen.
◦ Type II Deficiency: Low activity with normal antigen.
E) QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform QC at the beginning of each shift of testing and when a
new reagent lot is the first used.
• Document all QC results and ensure they are within acceptable
limits before continuing patient testing.
• If QC fails, troubleshoot as per the analyzer’s troubleshooting
guide and do not report patient results until QC is passed.
F) REPORTING RESULTS
• Results are entered and verified in the LIS.
• The summary interpretation is crafted based on the assay results
and calculated interpretations.
• The interpretative summary must include the patient’s
antithrombin activity percentage, antigen percentage (if
performed), the interpretation of the results, and any relevant
clinical considerations.
G) CRITICAL RESULTS
• Critical low values (e.g. <50% activity) should be communicated
immediately to the ordering clinician and documented accordingly.
4. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the manufacturer’s instructions for assay-specific limitations
and ensure that common interferences (e.g., hemolysis, lipemia) are
considered when interpreting results.
