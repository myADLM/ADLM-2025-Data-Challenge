ANALYTICAL PHASE STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE
(SOP) FOR ANTI FACTOR XA, PLASMA
1. PURPOSE This procedure outlines the steps and
responsibilities for the analysis of Anti-Factor Xa levels in
plasma to provide consistent, accurate, and reliable results in
our CLIA-certified laboratory.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory staff are responsible for
performing, documenting, and validating the test according to this
protocol. It is the responsibility of all laboratory staff to adhere to
these procedures and to report any deviations or issues to a
supervisor immediately.
1. DEFINITION Anti-Factor Xa (Anti-FXa) assay is a specific
coagulometric test performed to measure the pharmacologic
concentration of anticoagulant therapy in plasma, typically used
for monitoring Heparin or Low Molecular Weight Heparin
(LMWH).
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS 3.1 Specimen Type:
• Citrated plasma collected in a light blue-top (3.2% sodium citrate)
tube.
• Ensure proper mix of blood and anticoagulant immediately after
collection by gentle inversion.
3.2 Stability and Handling:
• Plasma should be separated from cells within 2 hours of
collection.
• Store separated plasma at 2-8°C if analysis is performed within 4
hours.
• For long-term storage, keep plasma frozen at -20°C or colder.
Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
3.3 Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric specimens.
• Specimens collected in non-citrate tubes.
• Clotted specimens.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS 4.1 Equipment:
• Automated Coagulation Analyzer (e.g., ACL TOP, Siemens BCS-
XP)
• Centrifuge capable of reaching 1500-2500 g
• Pipettes and tips
4.2 Reagents:
• Factor Xa chromogenic substrate
• Calibrators specific for Heparin or LMWH
• Quality control materials (high and low levels)
• Manufacturer-provided running buffer and reagents for the assay
1. PROCEDURE 5.1 Specimen Preparation:
• Centrifuge the citrated blood tubes at 1500-2500 g for 15 minutes
at room temperature.
• Transfer the upper plasma layer to a clean plastic tube promptly,
avoiding any cellular components.
5.2 Instrument Setup and Calibration:
• Turn on the coagulation analyzer and perform instrument startup
routines as per the manufacturer’s manual.
• Ensure that all necessary reagents, calibrators, and controls are
loaded.
• Perform calibration using the provided calibrators according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
5.3 Quality Control:
• Run quality control (QC) material at the start of each shift and with
each new batch of reagents or calibrators.
• Document the QC results and take appropriate corrective actions
if values fall outside the acceptable range.
5.4 Patient Sample Analysis:
• Load patient samples into the analyzer.
• Select the test panel for Anti-Factor Xa on the analyzer.
• Follow the analyzer prompts to perform the test.
• The analyzer will automatically perform the test, presenting
results in appropriate units.
5.5 Result Validation:
• Review all results for errors, instrument flags, or QC failures.
• Validate results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• If results are outside expected therapeutic ranges, notify the
responsible healthcare provider in line with critical values policies.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results should be reported in IU/mL.
• Reference ranges:
◦ Prophylactic LMWH: 0.2 – 0.5 IU/mL
◦ Therapeutic LMWH: 0.5 – 2.0 IU/mL
◦ Unfractionated Heparin: 0.3 – 0.7 IU/mL
• Document and verify results in LIS according to site-specific
reporting guidelines.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Interferences: Lipemia, hemolysis, or icterus may affect the
accuracy of results.
• Heparin analogs other than LMWH or unfractionated heparin may
not be detected accurately.
1. QUALITY CONTROL AND PROFICIENCY TESTING
• Perform ongoing quality control in accordance with laboratory
policies.
• Participate in external proficiency testing programs.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions for use of specific coagulation
analyzers and reagents.
• Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines for
coagulation testing.
1. DOCUMENTATION
• Maintain logs for calibrations, daily QC, instrument maintenance,
and analytical runs.
• Ensure all documentation is complete, accurate, and filed in
compliance with laboratory quality management procedures.
All laboratory personnel involved in Anti-Factor Xa testing must be
trained on this SOP and must demonstrate competency before
independently performing the assay.
