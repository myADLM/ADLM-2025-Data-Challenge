SOP: Analytical Phase of Generating Results for Apixaban, Anti-
Xa, Plasma
1. Purpose:
To outline the standard operating procedure for the analytical phase
of generating results for Apixaban, Anti-Xa levels in plasma, ensuring
accurate and reliable test results.
1. Scope:
This procedure is applicable to all laboratory personnel responsible
for performing Apixaban, Anti-Xa assays in plasma samples.
1. Specimen Requirements:
◦ Preferred: Freshly collected plasma sample in sodium
citrate tubes. The sample must be centrifuged promptly to
separate plasma.
◦ Acceptable: Plasma sample in heparinized tubes.
◦ Unacceptable: Hemolyzed samples, samples with clots, and
specimens received in EDTA or other anticoagulant tubes.
2. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies:
◦ Anti-Xa assay reagents as specified by the manufacturer.
◦ Calibration standards for Apixaban, Anti-Xa assay.
◦ Control plasma samples: low, medium, and high Anti-Xa
levels.
◦ Centrifuge: Capable of achieving the required g-force for
plasma separation.
◦ Pipettes and tips.
◦ Microplate reader or equivalent analytical instrument for
absorbance reading.
3. Procedure:
A) Plasma Collection and Preparation:
1. Collect the blood sample in sodium citrate tubes.
2. Centrifuge the sample at 1500 g for 10 minutes to
separate plasma.
3. Carefully pipette the plasma into labeled sample tubes for
analysis.
4. Ensure samples are free of fibrin clots and hemolysis.
B) Calibration and Quality Control:
1. Prepare calibration standards according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
2. Prepare quality control samples at low, medium, and high
Anti-Xa levels.
3. Calibrate the microplate reader or equivalent analytical
instrument.
4. Run quality control samples to validate the assay
performance.
C) Assay Procedure:
1. Follow the provided assay kit protocol to prepare and
process samples.
2. Pipette plasma samples into the appropriate wells of the
microplate.
3. Add assay reagents as specified by the manufacturer.
4. Incubate microplate as per the kit instructions.
5. Measure absorbance at the specified wavelength using
the microplate reader.
6. Record readings and calculate Anti-Xa levels using the
calibration curve.
D) Result Interpretation and Reporting:
1. Verify the quality control results to ensure assay accuracy.
2. Analyze sample results based on calibration standards.
3. Review results for consistency and accuracy before
reporting.
4. Document any discrepancies or issues encountered
during the assay.
5. Enter validated results into the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
6. Ensure all data is reviewed and verified by the
responsible technologist.
4. Quality Control and Troubleshooting:
A) Quality Control:
◦ Perform quality control checks with each batch of samples
analyzed.
◦ Document QC results and any corrective actions taken.
◦ Review QC trends and investigate any out-of-control results.
B) Troubleshooting:
◦ If calibration fails, check reagent preparation and expiration
dates.
◦ Reassess sample preparation for any procedural deviations.
◦ Repeat the assay if QC samples fail to meet acceptance
criteria.
◦ Consult technical support for unresolved instrument or
reagent issues.
5. References:
◦ Manufacturer's Package Insert for Anti-Xa assay.
◦ Laboratory Quality Assurance Manual.
◦ Current Clinical Laboratory Standards from regulatory
bodies.
6. Documentation:
◦ Record all assay details, including calibrations, QC results,
sample identifiers, and final report.
◦ Maintain comprehensive logs for instrument maintenance
and reagent usage.
◦ Secure all documentation in compliance with laboratory
standards and regulatory requirements.
