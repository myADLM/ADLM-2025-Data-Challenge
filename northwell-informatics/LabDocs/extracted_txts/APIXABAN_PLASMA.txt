STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP) FOR APIXABAN,
PLASMA ANALYSIS
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the procedure for the quantitative determination of
Apixaban in plasma samples. The assay must produce reliable and
reproducible results for clinical use.
Responsibility:
Designated clinical laboratory staff are responsible for performing and
documenting the analysis of Apixaban in plasma. Supervisors must
ensure compliance and address any issues as they arise.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type:
• Plasma collected in EDTA or citrate tubes.
Specimen Collection:
• Collect blood using standard venipuncture technique.
• Gently invert the tube several times to mix the anticoagulant with
the blood.
• Centrifuge the sample at 1500-2000 x g for 10-15 minutes at
room temperature within 2 hours of collection.
• Transfer the plasma to a polypropylene tube using a plastic
pipette and freeze at -20°C or lower if not analyzed immediately.
• Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
Specimen Stability:
• Plasma specimens are stable for up to 1 month at -20°C and up
to 6 months at -80°C.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
• Samples stored at temperatures above -20°C for extended
periods.
• Specimens collected in tubes containing heparin.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• HPLC or LC-MS/MS system
• Centrifuge
• Polypropylene tubes
• Plastic pipettes and pipette tips
• Calibrators and controls for Apixaban
• Mobile phase components (e.g., acetonitrile, water, formic acid)
• Extraction solvents
• Glass vials and autosampler vials
• Appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE)
1. CALIBRATION AND QUALITY CONTROL
Calibration:
• Prepare a calibration curve using Apixaban standards at
concentrations covering the clinical range.
• Include at least five concentrations plus a blank.
Quality Control:
• Use low, medium, and high control samples to ensure assay
accuracy and precision.
• Process QC samples with each batch of patient samples.
• Acceptable QC limits must fall within the ±2SD of the established
mean.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation:
1. Thaw frozen plasma samples at room temperature and mix well
by gentle inversion.
2. Pipet an aliquot of plasma sample into a clean polypropylene
tube (typically 0.5 mL).
3. Add an internal standard solution to each sample, calibrator,
and control.
4. Perform plasma protein precipitation using an appropriate
solvent (e.g., acetonitrile). Vortex mix for 1-2 minutes.
5. Centrifuge at 15000 x g for 10 minutes and transfer the clear
supernatant to a clean container.
6. Further dilute or clean up the extract, if necessary, before
analysis.
B. Instrumental Analysis:
1. Set up the HPLC or LC-MS/MS system according to
manufacturer specifications.
2. Equilibrate the column with the appropriate mobile phase (e.g.,
acetonitrile-water with formic acid).
3. Inject a specified volume of the processed sample (e.g., 10µL).
4. Run the developed gradient elution program.
5. Detect and quantify Apixaban using specific mass transitions for
both analyte and internal standard.
C. Data Analysis:
1. Generate calibration curves and ensure linearity within the
desired range.
2. Calculate the concentration of Apixaban in patient samples
using the calibration curve.
3. Perform a review for any potential outliers or errors and take
corrective actions if necessary.
4. REPORTING RESULTS
• Verify all results before reporting.
• Record final results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Report units in ng/mL.
• Ensure results falling outside the reference range or indicating
critical values are communicated to the appropriate healthcare
provider in a timely manner.
1. LIMITATIONS
• Ensure no interference from other medications or substances
present in the plasma.
• Be aware of potential matrix effects and use adequate controls to
mitigate.
1. REFERENCES
• Reference ranges and assay validation documentation from
previous methodological setups.
• Instrument operation manuals and respective package inserts for
chemicals and reagents used.
By adhering to the outlined standards, the laboratory ensures the
accurate and reproducible quantification of Apixaban in plasma,
thereby supporting effective clinical decision-making.
