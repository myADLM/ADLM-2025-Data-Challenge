Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for APOL1 Genotyping
1. PURPOSE To provide a detailed procedure for performing APOL1
genotyping including sample preparation, polymerase chain reaction
(PCR), sequence detection, data analysis, and reporting of results.
Responsibility:
• Laboratory scientists are responsible for performing the
genotyping assay, verifying the accuracy of the results, and
maintaining the instruments according to the procedure.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring compliance with this
SOP and addressing any discrepancies, errors, or issues during
analysis.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Acceptable specimens:
◦ Peripheral blood samples collected in EDTA tubes.
◦ Buccal swabs for DNA collection.
• Unacceptable specimens:
◦ Blood samples collected in heparin tubes.
3. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
• DNA extraction kit (e.g., Qiagen DNA extraction kit)
• PCR thermocycler
• DNA quantification instrument (e.g., NanoDrop)
• Real-Time PCR System
• APOL1 Genotyping kit (manufacturer-specific)
• Sterile pipette tips and microcentrifuge tubes
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
4. PROCEDURE
A. DNA Extraction:
1. Extract genomic DNA from the specimen using the
recommended DNA extraction kit.
2. Measure DNA concentration and purity using a
spectrophotometer (e.g., NanoDrop).
3. Normalize the DNA concentration to the required working
concentration for PCR (e.g., 10-50 ng/µL).
B. PCR Amplification:
1. Prepare the PCR master mix according to the manufacturer's
protocol specific to the APOL1 Genotyping Kit.
2. Aliquot the master mix into PCR tubes or plates, avoiding
contamination by using sterile techniques.
3. Add the specified amount of genomic DNA to each tube/well.
4. Cap or seal the tubes/plates and load the PCR thermocycler.
5. Run the PCR program according to the genotyping kit
instructions which typically include initial denaturation,
denaturation, annealing, extension, and final extension.
C. Genotyping Reaction:
1. After PCR amplification, load PCR product on to the Real-Time
PCR system or appropriate sequencer.
2. Follow the specific detection protocol outlined in the genotyping
kit, which may include primer extension, hybridization, and
fluorescence detection.
D. Data Analysis:
1. Export raw genotyping data from the Real-Time PCR system.
2. Analyze the data using appropriate software provided by the
genotyping kit manufacturer.
3. Identify APOL1 risk alleles (e.g., G1, G2 alleles) by comparing
sample signals against control signals.
4. Record results in the laboratory information system (LIS) for
verification.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Use positive and negative controls in every PCR run to ensure
assay validity.
2. Include internal controls specific to APOL1 genotype to verify
target amplification.
3. If control results do not fall within expected ranges, troubleshoot
and repeat the assay.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Verify that all controls meet the acceptance criteria before
interpreting results.
2. Document the genotype identified (e.g., G1/G1, G1/G2, G2/G2,
or absence of risk alleles).
3. Report results to the LIS and ensure they are reviewed and
verified by a technologist.
4. Confidentially communicate results to the ordering clinician.
7. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• G0/G0: Absence of risk alleles
• G1 or G2: Presence of risk alleles correlating with increased risk
of renal diseases.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Mutations other than those specifically included in the genotyping
assay will not be detected.
• Sub-optimal DNA quality or interference may affect results.
• Users must be aware of the manufacturer’s limitations as
indicated in the kit insert.
9. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If amplification or detection fails, verify reagent integrity, review
PCR conditions, and check equipment calibration.
• If contamination is suspected, decontaminate work surfaces and
use fresh reagents.

Note: Always adhere to the latest clinical guidelines and laboratory
safety protocols while performing genotyping tests. Ensure
continuous professional development and training on relevant
updates up to and including October 2023.
