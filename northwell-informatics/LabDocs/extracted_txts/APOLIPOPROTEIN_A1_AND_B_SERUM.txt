Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Generation of Results
for APOLIPOPROTEIN A1 AND B, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized protocol for the analytical phase of testing
and generating results for Apolipoprotein A1 (Apo A1) and
Apolipoprotein B (Apo B) in serum samples. This ensures accuracy
and consistency in test performance and result reporting.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
• The laboratory technologists are responsible for performing the
assay according to this SOP.
• The laboratory supervisor is responsible for overseeing the
adherence to this SOP and addressing any deviations or issues.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen Type:
• Serum
Collection and Handling:
• Collect blood using standard venipuncture technique.
• Allow blood to clot at room temperature for 30 minutes and then
centrifuge at 1500 x g for 10 minutes to separate the serum.
• Immediately transfer the serum to a clean plastic tube.
Storage:
• Serum samples should be stored at 2-8°C and tested within 7
days.
• For long-term storage, serum samples should be frozen at -20°C
or colder. Samples are stable for up to 6 months at -20°C and up
to one year at -70°C.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Grossly hemolytic, lipemic, or icteric samples.
• Samples collected in tubes other than those specified.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Automated immunoassay analyzer (e.g., Roche Cobas 8000)
• Centrifuge
• Refrigerated storage (2-8°C)
• Freezer (-20°C and -70°C)
• Vortex mixer
Reagents:
• Apo A1 and Apo B assay kits (e.g., from Siemens or Roche
Diagnostics)
• Quality control materials (low, medium, and high)
• Calibrators specific for Apo A1 and Apo B assays
Supplies:
• Primary and secondary serum tubes
• Pipettes and disposable tips
• Gloves and lab coat
5. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Verify that the analyzer is properly calibrated and quality control
checks have been performed.
2. Ensure all reagents are within their expiration date and have
been properly stored.
3. Thaw frozen samples at room temperature and mix gently by
inversion or vortex mixer.
Assay Procedure:
1. Program the analyzer with the appropriate assay protocol for
Apo A1 and Apo B.
2. Load the calibrators, quality control materials, and patient
samples onto the analyzer.
3. Initiate the assay run on the analyzer.
4. Monitor the assay run for any error messages or alerts.
Quality Control:
1. Include at least two levels of quality control materials with each
assay run (low and high).
2. Ensure that quality control results are within acceptable ranges
before releasing patient results.
3. Document all quality control results as per laboratory protocol.
Result Interpretation:
1. Review the results generated by the analyzer for each patient
sample.
2. Confirm that all internal quality control parameters are met.
3. If any discrepancies or outliers are noted, investigate and
repeat the analysis if necessary.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Transmit the validated results to the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
2. Ensure the results are reviewed and verified by a qualified
technologist before final release.
3. Report the results to the clinician along with appropriate
reference intervals.
7. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Apo A1: 110 – 205 mg/dL
• Apo B: 55 – 140 mg/dL
8. QUALITY CONTROL AND CALIBRATION
• Calibrators and quality control materials should be run according
to the manufacturer's instructions.
• Perform calibration with each new lot of reagents or as
recommended by the manufacturer.
• Maintain records of all calibrations and quality control checks.
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to the manufacturer's insert for specific limitations related to
the assay.
• Ensure that all pre-analytical variables are controlled to minimize
variability and errors.
10. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's kit insert for Apo A1 and Apo B assays.
• Standard laboratory quality control and calibration protocols.
• Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines.
11. DOCUMENTATION
• Maintain records of all assay runs, calibrations, and quality control
checks.
• Document any deviations from the SOP and actions taken to
address them.
• Ensure all records are retained as per laboratory documentation
policies.
By following this SOP, the laboratory ensures accurate and reliable
generation of results for Apolipoprotein A1 and B, serum, contributing
to high-quality patient care.
