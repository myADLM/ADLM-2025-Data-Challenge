Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for APOLIPOPROTEIN A1,
SERUM
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedure for the analysis
of Apo A1 (Apolipoprotein A1) in serum samples to ensure accurate
and reliable results.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of designated laboratory personnel to perform
the analysis as per this SOP. All staff must ensure that the tests are
performed, documented, and results are verified appropriately.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
3.1 Equipment
• Automated Chemistry Analyzer (e.g., Roche Cobas, Beckman
Coulter)
• Refrigerated Centrifuge
• Serum Separator Tubes (SST) or plain red-top tubes
3.2 Reagents
• Apo A1 specific reagents (EK-8X19, or equivalent)
• Calibrators
• Controls (high and low)
3.3 Supplies
• Pipettes
• Disposable tips
• Eppendorf tubes
• Absorbent wipes
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
4.1 Specimen Type
• Serum
4.2 Specimen Collection
• Collect 5 mL of blood into a serum separator tube (SST) or plain
red-top tube.
• Allow blood to clot for 30 minutes at room temperature.
• Centrifuge sample at 1500 x g for 10 minutes.
4.3 Specimen Handling and Storage
• Separate the serum from the clot immediately after centrifugation.
• Aliquot serum into properly labelled Eppendorf tubes.
• Store specimens at 2-8°C for up to 72 hours or freeze at -20°C for
longer storage.
4.4 Unacceptable Specimens
• Specimens with excessive hemolysis or lipema.
• Specimens collected in anticoagulant tubes such as EDTA,
heparin, or citrate.
1. PROCEDURE
5.1 Calibration
• Perform calibration of the Chemistry Analyzer using Apo A1
calibrators according to manufacturer instructions.
• Document calibration details in the Calibration Log.
5.2 Quality Control
• Run high and low controls daily and with each new lot of
reagents.
• Verify that control results are within acceptable ranges before
proceeding with patient samples.
• Document control results in the Quality Control Log.
5.3 Sample Preparation and Analysis
• Ensure the Chemistry Analyzer is ready for operation and check
necessary reagent levels.
• Make sure serum samples are thawed completely if frozen and
brought to room temperature.
• Load prepared serum samples onto the Chemistry Analyzer
according to manufacturer instructions.
5.4 Result Generation
• The analyzer will automatically perform the apo A1 assay and
generate results.
• Review the data for any flags indicating potential issues like
calibration errors or out-of-range quality controls.
1. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
Refer to reference intervals:
• Normal Range for Apo A1 in serum: 100-200 mg/dL
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results will be automatically transmitted to the Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
• Ensure all results are reviewed and verified before final
acceptance and reporting to the healthcare provider.
• Add comments in the LIS if any sample showed interference or
flags as per analytical result.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to manufacturer’s insert for specific limitations of Apo A1 assay,
including influences of biotin, hemolysis, lipemia, and icterus.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If any QC fails, immediately investigate by repeating QC,
evaluating reagents, and checking calibrations.
• If sample result flags or issues occur, review specific sample
history, reanalyze the sample if necessary, and contact technical
support or supervisor for further guidance.

1. REVIEW AND DOCUMENTATION
This SOP should be reviewed annually and updated as necessary to
reflect technological advances or procedural modifications. Staff
training and competency records should be retained.
Document SOP version number, approval signatures, and review
date.
