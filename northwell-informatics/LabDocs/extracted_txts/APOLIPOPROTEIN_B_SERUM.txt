Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for APOLIPOPROTEIN B
Analysis in Serum
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized protocol for the measurement of
Apolipoprotein B (ApoB) in serum samples using
immunoturbidimetric assay for the purpose of accurate and
consistent patient results.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory staff will carry out the ApoB testing procedures
as defined in this document. It is the responsibility of the supervisory
staff to ensure adherence to the procedures, documentation, and
corrective actions.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/Acceptable:
• Serum: Collect blood into a red-top tube or gel-barrier tube. After
collection, allow the sample to clot and centrifuge to separate the
serum.
Unacceptable:
• Specimens containing a significant amount of hemolysis or
lipemia may interfere with the assay results.
• Specimens with insufficient volume to perform the test.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Immunoturbidimetric assay kit for Apolipoprotein B
(Manufacturer's name and kit number)
• Spectrophotometer or clinical chemistry analyzer compatible with
the assay kit
• Calibrators and controls specific to the ApoB assay
• Pipettes and tips
• Centrifuge
• Timer
• Quality control materials
1. PROCEDURE
Pre-Analysis:
• Ensure that all reagents, controls, and calibrators are brought to
room temperature prior to use.
• Verify that the instrument setup and calibration are completed
according to the manufacturer’s specifications.
Sample Preparation:
1. Confirm that the serum specimens are free from any significant
hemolysis or lipemia.
2. For samples stored frozen, thaw at room temperature and mix
thoroughly before analysis.
Assay Execution:
1. Load the serum samples, calibrators, and controls onto the
analyzer.
2. Follow the instructions provided in the immunoturbidimetric
assay kit insert to prepare and run the assay.
3. Start the analysis using the appropriate program settings for
Apolipoprotein B.
Reading and Interpretation:
1. The analyzer will measure the turbidity created by antigen-
antibody complexes and produce a quantitative result for ApoB
concentration.
2. Verify that the results for the controls fall within the acceptable
range as defined by the manufacturer's coaxial criteria.
3. Review the results generated by the analyzer. Ensure that any
flags or error codes are resolved.
Post-Analysis:
1. Document the results, including date, time, and initials of the
technologist in the appropriate log.
2. Perform any necessary corrective action if quality control
results fall outside the acceptable range.
3. Review and verify patient results before transmitting them to the
Laboratory Information System (LIS).
4. QUALITY CONTROL
Perform quality control tests following predefined schedules (e.g.,
daily, bi-weekly) to assess the accuracy and precision of the ApoB
measurements.
• Utilize two levels of control material for each analytical run.
• If the control results do not fall within the acceptable limits,
perform corrective actions including re-calibration, equipment
maintenance, or rerun of the assay as needed.
• Document all actions and resolutions in the quality control log.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
Review results in LIS for accuracy and potential mixed or
questionable results:
• Critical results should be highlighted and flagged for immediate
communication to the responsible medical staff.
• Clearly state if specimen integrity issues are encountered (e.g.,
hemolysis).
• Utilize site-specific reporting guidelines to ensure consistency in
reported results.
Reference Intervals: Normal ranges for Apolipoprotein B in serum
differ based on demographic factors (e.g., age, sex). Refer to site-
specific or manufacturer-provided intervals.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the assay kit insert for method-specific limitations, including
potential interferences with hemolysis, lipemia, and certain
medications.
