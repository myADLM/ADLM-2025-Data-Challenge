Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Apolipoprotein E
(APOE) Genotyping, Blood
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to provide a standardized protocol
for the genotyping of Apolipoprotein E (APOE) from blood samples.
This involves the analysis of DNA to determine the allelic variants
present for the APOE gene, which are relevant for assessing risks for
Alzheimer's disease and cardiovascular diseases. This SOP ensures
consistent and accurate results.
Responsibility:
Laboratory Scientists trained in molecular techniques are responsible
for performing the analysis as detailed in this SOP. It is also their
responsibility to ensure that all equipment is calibrated and
functioning properly and that quality control measures are adhered
to.
1. SPECIMEN
Preferred Specimen:
• Whole blood collected in EDTA tubes.
Specimen Stability:
• Stable at 2-8°C for up to 7 days. For long-term storage, freeze at
-20°C or below.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Automated nucleic acid extraction system
• Real-Time PCR Thermocycler
• Microcentrifuge
• Pipettes and sterile pipette tips
• Vortex mixer
Reagents and Supplies:
• DNA extraction kits
• APOE genotyping assay kit (PCR primers and probes specific for
APOE ε2, ε3, ε4 alleles)
• PCR reaction mix including Taq polymerase, dNTPs, MgCl2,
buffer
• Nuclease-free water
• Sterile 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes
• DNA ladder and molecular weight markers for gel electrophoresis
• Ethanol and isopropanol for DNA precipitation
• PCR plates and sealing films
1. PROCEDURE
A) DNA Extraction:
1. Specimen Preparation:
◦ Gently mix the whole blood sample in the EDTA tube.
◦ Pipette an appropriate volume (e.g., 200 µL) into a clean,
labeled microcentrifuge tube.
2. DNA Isolation:
◦ Follow the manufacturer's instructions for the DNA
extraction kit.
◦ Elute the DNA in an appropriate volume (e.g., 50 µL) of
elution buffer.
◦ Assess DNA purity and concentration using a
spectrophotometer or fluorometer.
B) PCR Amplification:
1. Reagent Preparation:
◦ Prepare the PCR reaction mix according to the APOE
genotyping assay kit instructions.
◦ Include primers and probes specific to the APOE alleles ε2,
ε3, and ε4.
2. PCR Setup:
◦ Aliquot the PCR reaction mix into PCR plates.
◦ Add the extracted DNA to each well (template DNA ~50 ng
per reaction).
3. Thermocycling Conditions:
◦ Follow the recommended thermocycling conditions from the
kit:
▪ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 10 minutes
▪ Denaturation: 95°C for 15 seconds
▪ Annealing/Extension: 60°C for 1 minute
▪ Number of Cycles: 40
C) Detection and Interpretation:
1. Real-Time PCR Detection:
◦ Monitor fluorescence during the PCR to detect the specific
APOE alleles.
◦ Analyze the amplification curves to determine the presence
of allelic variants.
2. Data Analysis:
◦ Using the software associated with the Real-Time PCR
Thermocycler, determine the genotype of each sample by
comparing the fluorescence signals to known controls.
◦ Confirm the results by analyzing the melt curves or gel
electrophoresis if necessary.
3. QUALITY CONTROL
Internal Controls:
• Include positive controls (known APOE genotypes) and negative
controls (no template controls) in each run to ensure the accuracy
of the genotyping process.
External Controls:
• Participate in external quality assessment schemes bi-annually to
validate the testing process.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Report genotyping results according to laboratory-specific
guidelines.
• Ensure that the genotype (e.g., APOE ε3/ε4) and any relevant
interpretations (e.g., increased risk for late-onset Alzheimer's
disease) are clearly communicated.
• Results should be reviewed and verified by a qualified laboratory
technologist before reporting.

8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• PCR inhibitors present in the blood sample may affect the result
accuracy.
• Rare polymorphisms or mutations outside the targeted regions
may not be detected by this method.
