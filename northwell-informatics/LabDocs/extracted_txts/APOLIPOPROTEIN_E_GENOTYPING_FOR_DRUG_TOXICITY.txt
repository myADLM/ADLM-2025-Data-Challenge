Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Apolipoprotein E
(APOE) Genotyping for Drug Toxicity
1. PURPOSE:
To standardize the procedure for determining the Apolipoprotein
E (APOE) genotype of patients for the assessment of drug
toxicity.
2. RESPONSIBILITY:
◦ It is the responsibility of all designated laboratory staff to
follow this procedure accurately and ensure the reliability of
results.
◦ Supervisors must ensure all staff are adequately trained in
this procedure and monitor adherence to it.
3. DEFINITION:
Apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotyping involves the analysis of
specific polymorphisms in the APOE gene to predict an
individual’s risk for adverse drug reactions.
4. EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS:
◦ PCR Thermal Cycler
◦ Microcentrifuge
◦ Nucleic acid extraction kit
◦ PCR primers specific to APOE polymorphisms (e.g.
rs429358, rs7412)
◦ Taq DNA Polymerase
◦ 1X PCR buffer
◦ dNTP mix
◦ Agarose gel electrophoresis setup
◦ Ethidium bromide or an alternative DNA stain
◦ DNA ladders/size markers
◦ UV transilluminator gel documentation system
5. REAGENTS:
◦ DNA extraction buffer
◦ Ethanol
◦ TE buffer
◦ Loading dye
◦ Ethidium bromide or a suitable alternative
◦ Appropriate molecular grade water
◦ Disposable gloves and lab coats for protection
6. PROCEDURE:
A. Sample Preparation:
1. Extract genomic DNA from the received sample using the
nucleic acid extraction kit following the manufacturer’s
instructions.
2. Check the concentration and purity of the extracted DNA
by spectrophotometry or fluorometry and record the
values.
B. PCR Amplification:
1. Prepare the PCR reaction mixture for each sample and a
negative control as follows:
▪ 10X PCR buffer: 2.5 µL
▪ dNTP mix (10 mM each): 1.0 µL
▪ Forward Primer (10 µM): 1.0 µL
▪ Reverse Primer (10 µM): 1.0 µL
▪ Taq DNA Polymerase (5 U/µL): 0.5 µL
▪ Template DNA: 1.0 µL (approximately 50-100 ng)
▪ Molecular grade water: to a final volume of 25 µL
2. Program the thermal cycler with the following settings:
▪ Initial Denaturation: 95°C for 5 minutes
▪ 35-40 Cycles of:
▪ Denaturation: 95°C for 30 seconds
▪ Annealing: 58-62°C (depending on primers) for 30
seconds
▪ Extension: 72°C for 30 seconds
▪ Final Extension: 72°C for 7 minutes
▪ Hold at 4°C
C. Gel Electrophoresis:
1. Prepare a 2% agarose gel in 1X TAE or TBE buffer.
2. Add an appropriate amount of DNA stain (e.g., ethidium
bromide) to the molten agarose.
3. Once the gel solidifies, load 5 µL of each PCR product
mixed with 1 µL of loading dye into the wells.
4. Include a DNA ladder/size marker in one lane.
5. Run the gel at 100V for approximately 1 hour, or until the
dye front has migrated to at least ¾ of the gel.
D. Visualization and Documentation:
1. Visualize the gel under a UV transilluminator.
2. Capture an image of the gel.
3. Compare the bands to the DNA ladder to confirm the size
of the amplified products.
4. Document findings and interpretations in the lab records.
7. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS:
◦ Positive controls should show bands at the expected
positions.
◦ The negative control should not show any bands.
◦ Compare patient sample bands against the expected sizes
for APOE alleles (e.g., E2, E3, E4) to determine the
genotype.
8. QUALITY CONTROL:
◦ Include a positive control and a negative control in every
batch of PCR.
◦ Use aliquots and single-use reagents where possible to
avoid contamination.
◦ Regularly perform maintenance on the PCR machine and
electrophoresis equipment.
9. REPORTING RESULTS:
◦ Carefully review the genotyping results and document the
allele designation for each sample.
◦ Report results in accordance with the laboratory’s reporting
guidelines, ensuring information is accurately transferred to
the LIS (Laboratory Information System).
10. TROUBLESHOOTING:
◦ No bands observed: Verify DNA concentration and quality,
check PCR reagents, and ensure proper thermal cycler
settings.
◦ Multiple bands: Optimize PCR conditions (annealing
temperature, Mg2+ concentration) and check primer
specificity.
◦ Smearing: Check DNA quality, avoid overloading the gel,
and use fresh reagents.
