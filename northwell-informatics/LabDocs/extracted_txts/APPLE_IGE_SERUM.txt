Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analysis of APPLE,
IGE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
This document describes the standard procedures for the analytical
phase of testing APPLE, IGE, SERUM using the laboratory's
designated equipment. The procedure aims to ensure accuracy,
precision, and reliability in the analysis of serum IgE levels.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the
analysis according to this SOP.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring staff compliance with the
SOP and for resolving any discrepancies that arise.
1. DEFINITION
• APPLE: The specific IgE for apple, an allergen test component.
• IGE: Immunoglobulin E, an antibody.
• SERUM: The clear, pale-yellow liquid that separates from the
blood upon clotting and contains proteins, including antibodies.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Requirements
• Serum samples should be collected in SST tubes (Serum
Separator Tubes).
• Allow the blood to clot for 30 minutes and then centrifuge the
samples at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes to separate the serum.
• The separated serum should be stored at 2-8°C if analyzed within
24 hours, or otherwise frozen at -20°C for longer storage.
B. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies
• Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) Reader
• Microtiter plates
• Pipettes and tips
• Wash buffer
• Dilution buffer
• Substrate solution
• Stop solution
• Specific IgE standards and controls
• Conjugate reagent
• Apple allergen reagent
C. Testing Procedure
1. Preparation
◦ Thaw the serum samples if they have been stored at -20°C.
◦ Allow all reagents and specimens to reach room
temperature before testing.
◦ Label the microtiter plates appropriately.
2. Sample and Reagent Preparation
◦ Dilute serum samples and controls as per the kit
instructions.
◦ Prepare reagents as specified in the ELISA kit manual.
3. Pipetting and Incubation
◦ Add 100 µL of diluted serum samples, standards, and
controls to the appropriate wells.
◦ Incubate the plate for 1 hour at room temperature.
4. Washing
◦ Wash the wells 5 times with wash buffer to remove any
unbound substances.
◦ Tap the plate to remove excess liquid completely.
5. Conjugate Addition
◦ Add 100 µL of enzyme conjugate to each well.
◦ Incubate the plate for 30 minutes at room temperature.
6. Second Washing
◦ Repeat the washing steps 5 times with wash buffer.
7. Substrate Reaction
◦ Add 100 µL of substrate solution to each well. Incubate in
the dark for 15-30 minutes.
8. Stopping the Reaction
◦ Add 50 µL of stop solution to each well to terminate the
reaction. The plate should be read immediately on the
ELISA reader.
9. Reading and Recording Results
◦ Measure the optical density (OD) at 450 nm within 10
minutes of stopping the reaction.
◦ Record the OD values and calculate the concentration of
specific IgE using the provided standards and controls.
D. Quality Control
• Review QC samples before each assay run to ensure valid
calibration.
• Acceptable ranges for the IQC samples should be established,
and any sample outside the range must be investigated.
• Document any deviations and corrective actions taken.
E. Data Review and Reporting
• Verify the results obtained against the control values.
• Results are reported in IU/mL for specific IgE levels.
• Any result outside the reference interval or flagged as abnormal
must be reviewed by a supervisor before distribution.
1. Reference Intervals
• Specific IgE: Normal range <0.35 IU/mL (Note: Adjust according
to site-specific guidelines and medical necessity)
1. Result Reporting
• Ensure results are accurately entered into the Lab Information
System (LIS) for validation.
• Follow site-specific reporting guidelines for critical values and
unexpected results.

• Manufacturer’s instructions and product inserts
• Laboratory-specific QC guidelines
1. Method Limitations
• Refer to the ELISA kit insert for specific details and potential
interferences.
By following this detailed protocol, laboratory staff can ensure the
accurate and reliable analysis of APPLE, IGE, SERUM, leading to
dependable diagnostic information for healthcare providers.
