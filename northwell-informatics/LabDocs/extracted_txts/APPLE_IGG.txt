Standard Operating Procedures for APPLE IGG Testing
1. PURPOSE
To standardize the procedures for the analytical phase of generating
results for APPLE IGG testing, ensuring consistent and accurate
outputs while maintaining all necessary quality control standards.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing the
APPLE IGG testing process as outlined in this procedure. It is the
responsibility of all laboratory staff to identify and report any
procedural deviations or inconsistencies to their immediate
supervisor.
1. DEFINITION
APPLE IGG testing is utilized to measure the level of Immunoglobulin
G antibodies specific to APPLE in a patient’s serum, which can aid in
diagnosing and monitoring certain medical conditions.
1. PROCEDURE
Specimen Requirements:
• Preferred specimen: Serum collected using a gold or red-top tube.
• Volume: Minimum 1 mL of serum.
• Stability: The specimen should be refrigerated (2-8°C) if not
tested immediately, and tested within 48 hours of collection. If
longer storage is required, freeze at -20°C or lower.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric specimens
• Specimens collected in unapproved anticoagulants (e.g. EDTA,
citrate)
• Specimens not properly labeled or missing collection date/time
information
Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies:
• Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) reader
• APPLE IGG ELISA Test Kit
• Precision pipettes (20 µL, 100 µL, and 1 mL)
• Multichannel pipettes
• Microplate washer
• Timer
• Absorbent paper
• Calibrated incubator (set at 37°C)
Reagent Storage and Preparation:
• Store all reagents from the APPLE IGG ELISA Test Kit as per
manufacturer’s instructions.
• Allow all kit components and specimens to reach room
temperature before use.
• Prepare working wash buffer by diluting the concentrated wash
buffer with distilled water, as per the kit insert instructions.
Step-by-Step Procedure:
1. Preparation: Ensure all reagents and equipment are ready,
and pre-label the microtiter plate wells according to the number
of specimens plus controls (positive, negative, and calibrators).
2. Sample and Reagent Addition:
◦ Add 100 µL of diluted sample, calibrators, and controls to
the appropriate wells.
◦ Add 100 µL of enzyme conjugate to each well.
◦ Cover the plate with a lid or adhesive cover and incubate for
30 minutes at 37°C.
3. Washing:
◦ After incubation, aspirate the contents of the wells.
◦ Wash the wells 5 times with the prepared wash buffer using
a microplate washer or manually (ensure complete removal
of liquid after the final wash).
4. Substrate Addition:
◦ Add 100 µL of TMB substrate solution to each well.
◦ Incubate the plate in the dark for 15 minutes at room
temperature.
5. Stopping the Reaction:
◦ Add 50 µL of stop solution to each well to terminate the
reaction.
◦ Read the absorbance of each well at a wavelength of 450
nm within 15 minutes of adding the stop solution using an
ELISA reader.
Calculation of Results:
• Generate a standard curve using the absorbance values of the
calibrators.
• Calculate the concentration of APPLE IGG in patient specimens
based on the standard curve.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
Internal Quality Control:
• Run positive and negative controls with each assay batch.
• Ensure all control values fall within specified ranges.
• Document any deviations and perform corrective actions as
necessary.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
Results should be reported as per the laboratory’s official reporting
protocol and entered into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
Results must be reviewed and verified by the technologist before
releasing them to the relevant clinicians or departments.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING
Instrument and Reagent Issues:
• If issues arise with the ELISA reader, follow manufacturer's
troubleshooting guide and consult with the technical support team
as needed.
• If the test kit lot number changes, conduct a batch validation using
known controls and patient samples before routine use.
• Reagents malfunction: If a reagent is suspected to be faulty,
replace with a new batch and re-perform the assay on any
affected specimens.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• The APPLE IGG assay is intended for serum samples only. Other
sample types may yield inaccurate results.
• Hemolyzed or lipemic samples can interfere with assay results
and should be avoided.

CONCLUSION
This protocol ensures standardized practices for the APPLE IGG test,
maintaining reliability and accuracy throughout the analytical process.
All laboratory personnel are expected to follow these procedures and
address any discrepancies according to laboratory policy.
