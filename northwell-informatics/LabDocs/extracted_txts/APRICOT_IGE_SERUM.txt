Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical
Phase of Generating Results for APRICOT (IgE),
SERUM
1. PURPOSE
To ensure accurate and reliable generation of APRICOT (IgE) serum
test results using a standardized approach for sample analysis,
including equipment calibration, assay performance, result validation,
and documentation.
2. SCOPE
This protocol applies to the analysis of APRICOT (IgE) levels in
serum samples within the clinical laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Technologists are responsible for following this SOP for all
APRICOT (IgE) assays, ensuring quality control, equipment
maintenance, and proper documentation.
• Supervisors are responsible for monitoring compliance with this
SOP and providing guidance for any deviations or corrective actions.
4. EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS
• Immunoassay Analyzer • Calibrators and Controls specific to
APRICOT (IgE) assay • Serum samples • Pipettes and tips • Reagent
kits for APRICOT (IgE) analysis • Laboratory consumables (e.g.,
gloves, tubes, and labels) • Quality control materials • Laboratory
Information System (LIS)
5. PROCEDURE
A) Pre-Analytical Phase
1. Specimen Preparation: • Ensure serum samples are properly
labeled and accessioned. • Confirm that samples are collected,
stored, and transported under optimal conditions. • Document
the date and time of sample receipt.
2. Equipment Preparation: • Power on the Immunoassay
Analyzer and allow it to warm up according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. • Perform a daily maintenance
check in accordance with the equipment manual, documenting
any issues and resolutions.
B) Analytical Phase
1. Reagents and Calibration: • Retrieve APRICOT (IgE) reagent
kits from storage and bring them to room temperature. •
Carefully prepare calibrators and controls, ensuring no cross-
contamination. • Load reagents, calibrators, and controls into
the analyzer following manufacturer's guidelines.
2. Sample Analysis: • Vortex serum samples for 5 seconds to
ensure homogeneity. • Sequentially load patient serum samples
into the analyzer. • Initiate the analytical run for APRICOT (IgE)
according to the instrument’s operating procedure.
3. Quality Control: • Run quality control (QC) samples with each
batch of patient samples. • Ensure that QC results fall within the
pre-defined acceptable ranges. • If QC results are out of range,
troubleshoot and re-run QC samples before proceeding with
patient samples. • Document any QC failures and corrective
actions taken.
4. Result Generation: • The analyzer will automatically measure
the APRICOT (IgE) concentrations and generate numerical
results. • Validate results by reviewing corresponding QC and
calibrator data. • If the test result shows deviation or
unexpected values, reanalyze the sample and seek assistance
from a supervisor if required.
C) Post-Analytical Phase
1. Result Documentation and Reporting: • Verify the results in
the LIS by comparing with instrument printouts and ensuring
consistency. • Transmit validated results to the LIS for report
generation. • Report any critical values immediately to the
referring physician, according to the lab policy. • Retain
printouts and electronic copies of results for recordkeeping.
2. Sample Storage and Disposal: • Store analyzed serum
samples at -20°C for 7 days post-analysis, in case re-analysis
is needed. • Dispose of samples and consumables following
biohazard waste protocols.
D) Quality Assurance
1. Internal Quality Controls: • Perform routine internal
proficiency testing to assess analyzer performance and
personnel competency. • Regularly review QC data and
trending to identify any persistent issues.
2. External Quality Controls: • Participate in external proficiency
testing programs as required to ensure the robustness and
accuracy of APRICOT (IgE) testing.
6. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• APRICOT (IgE): - Children: 0-20 IU/mL - Adults: 0-100 IU/mL
7. CRITICAL VALUES
• Values exceeding 1000 IU/mL should be flagged and immediately
reviewed by a supervisor before reporting.
