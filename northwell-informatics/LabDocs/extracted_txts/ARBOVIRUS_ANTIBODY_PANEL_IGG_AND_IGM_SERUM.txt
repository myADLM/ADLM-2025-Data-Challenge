Protocol for the Analytical Phase of Generating Results for
ARBOVIRUS ANTIBODY PANEL, IGG AND IGM, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized protocol for the detection and
quantification of IgG and IgM antibodies against arboviruses in serum
samples using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or an
equivalent immunoassay method. This protocol ensures accurate and
reliable results.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for following this
protocol.
• Supervisors are responsible for overseeing the process and
ensuring compliance with the protocol.
1. MATERIALS, EQUIPMENT, AND REAGENTS
• Serological microtiter plates
• Arbovirus-specific IgG and IgM ELISA kits
• Calibrated microplate reader
• Distilled or deionized water
• Wash buffer
• Incubator set to 37°C
• Calibrated pipettes and tips
• Serum samples
• Positive and negative control sera
• Personal protective equipment (PPE) including gloves, lab coat,
and eye protection
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
• Preferred Specimen: Fresh serum collected in a red or gold-top
tube.
• Stability: Serum samples are stable for up to 7 days at 2-8°C.
For long-term storage, serum samples should be frozen at -20°C
or colder.
• Unacceptable Specimens: Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric
samples; samples with visible contamination; samples collected in
tubes containing anticoagulants.
1. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation:
1. Reagents and Controls Preparation:
◦ Reconstitute and prepare all reagents and controls
according to the manufacturer's instructions.
◦ Bring all reagents and serum samples to room temperature
(20-25°C) before use.
2. Sample Preparation:
◦ Thaw serum samples if previously frozen and mix
thoroughly by gentle inversion.
B) Assay Procedure:
1. Label the microtiter plates appropriately for each sample and
control.
2. Add the required volume of serum sample and controls to the
wells (e.g., 100 µL per well).
3. Add the enzyme-conjugated secondary antibody to each well
according to the kit instructions.
4. Incubate the plates in a 37°C incubator for the time specified by
the manufacturer (typically 30-60 minutes).
5. Wash the wells multiple times with wash buffer to remove
unbound antibodies.
6. Add substrate solution to each well and incubate at room
temperature in the dark for the prescribed time (e.g., 15-30
minutes) until color development.
7. Stop the reaction by adding stop solution and read the
absorbance at the appropriate wavelength using a microplate
reader (e.g., 450 nm).
C) Analysis:
1. Calculate the mean absorbance values for each sample and
control.
2. Plot the standard curve using the absorbance values from the
control sera.
3. Determine the IgG and IgM antibody concentrations of the
arbovirus in each sample using the standard curve.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
5. Run positive and negative controls with each batch of tests to
ensure validity.
6. Ensure that all QC results fall within the acceptable range
before releasing patient results.
7. Perform instrument calibration and maintenance as per the
manufacturer's guidelines.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
9. Interpret the results based on the calculated concentrations.
◦ Negative: Antibody concentration below the cutoff value.
◦ Positive: Antibody concentration equal to or above the cutoff
value.
10. Document results in the laboratory information system (LIS).
11. Review and verify results by a qualified laboratory technologist
before releasing them.
12. Record findings, including any deviations or issues encountered
during testing.
13. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Negative: No detectable antibodies
• Positive: Detectable antibodies indicating probable exposure or
infection
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Cross-reactivity with other flaviviruses or related viruses.
• Interfering substances in the serum may affect the accuracy of the
test.
• The presence of rheumatoid factors or other autoimmune
conditions could result in false-positive results.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's instructions for the ELISA kit.
• Relevant clinical guidelines and scientific literature on arbovirus
serological testing.
1. REVIEW AND REVISION
