Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analysis of
ARBOVIRUS ANTIBODY PANEL, IGG AND IGM in SPINAL FLUID
1. PURPOSE
This SOP describes the analytical procedures for the detection and
quantification of IgG and IgM antibodies against arboviruses in spinal
fluid using an Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). This
ensures consistent, accurate, and reliable testing.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory technologists and supervisors are
responsible for performing, reviewing, and verifying test results.
• The laboratory supervisor is responsible for ensuring that the SOP
is followed and that all equipment is properly maintained.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type:
• Spinal Fluid (CSF)
Specimen Collection:
• Collect CSF in a sterile container.
• Label the specimen with the patient’s name, unique identification
number, date, and time of collection.
• Specimens should be transported to the laboratory immediately
after collection.
Specimen Stability:
• CSF should be analyzed as soon as possible after collection.
• Specimens may be stored at 2-8°C for up to 48 hours. For longer
storage, specimens should be frozen at -20°C or lower.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens with visible contamination or leakage.
• Specimens not properly labeled.
• Specimens that are improperly transported, e.g., exposed to
excessive heat.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• ELISA plate reader
• Incubator (37°C)
• Centrifuge
• Micropipettes and tips
• Multichannel pipette
Reagents:
• ELISA kits for Arbovirus IgG and IgM antibodies
• Wash buffer
• Substrate solution
• Stop solution
Supplies:
• ELISA microplates
• Plate seals
• Reagent reservoirs
• Disposable gloves
• Calibrated pipettes and tips
1. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Bring all reagents to room temperature before use. Follow the
manufacturer's instructions for any kit-specific preparations.
2. Set up the ELISA plate according to the layout plan, including
control wells, calibrators, and patient samples. Ensure proper
labeling and identification.
Assay Steps:
1. Sample Dilution:
◦ Dilute CSF samples 1:100 in sample diluent according to
the ELISA kit instructions.
2. Addition of Controls and Samples:
◦ Pipette the appropriate volume (usually 100 µL) of controls,
calibrators, and diluted patient samples into designated
wells.
3. Incubation:
◦ Cover the plate with a seal and incubate at 37°C for 60
minutes.
4. Washing:
◦ After incubation, remove the plate seal. Wash each well 3-5
times with wash buffer using an automated washer or
manually with a multichannel pipette.
5. Addition of Conjugate:
◦ Add 100 µL of enzyme conjugate to each well.
6. Secondary Incubation:
◦ Cover the plate and incubate at 37°C for 30 minutes.
7. Washing Again:
◦ Wash each well 3-5 times with wash buffer.
8. Addition of Substrate:
◦ Add 100 µL of substrate solution to each well. Incubate at
room temperature (20-25°C) in the dark for the time
specified by the manufacturer (usually 15-30 minutes).
9. Stopping the Reaction:
◦ Add 100 µL of stop solution to each well to terminate the
enzyme reaction.
10. Reading the Plate:
◦ Read the absorbance of each well at the wavelength
specified by the kit (usually around 450 nm) using the ELISA
plate reader.
11. RESULT INTERPRETATION
• Calculate the mean absorbance for each control, calibrator, and
sample.
• Determine the concentration of antibodies in the patient samples
using the standard curve generated from the calibrators.
• Compare the calculated concentrations to the reference intervals
provided by the ELISA kit manufacturer.
Result Reporting:
• Report results as either negative, equivocal, or positive according
to the cutoff values and interpretive criteria provided by the ELISA
kit.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
Internal QC:
• Include both positive and negative controls in each assay run.
• Verify that all control results fall within the acceptable range.
External QC:
• Participate in external proficiency testing programs as available to
ensure the accuracy and reliability of test results.
Troubleshooting:
• If controls do not meet the acceptance criteria, do not report
patient results. Investigate the cause, reconfigure or rerun the
assay as necessary.
• Ensure all equipment is calibrated and maintained per
manufacturer recommendations.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
Critical Values:
• Values indicating recent acute infection or significant clinical
concern should be immediately communicated to the physician or
requesting healthcare provider.
Documentation:
• Record all results in the laboratory information system (LIS).
• Ensure proper documentation of any issues encountered and
corrective actions taken.
