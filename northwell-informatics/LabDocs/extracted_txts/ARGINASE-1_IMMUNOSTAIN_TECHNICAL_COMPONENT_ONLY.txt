Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for ARGINASE-1
IMMUNOSTAIN, TECHNICAL COMPONENT ONLY
1. PURPOSE:
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the standardized procedure for
performing the ARGINASE-1 Immunostain test, ensuring accurate
and reproducible results in the technical component only. This SOP is
intended to maintain the integrity of laboratory results and allow for
quality control and troubleshooting in the histopathology/
immunohistochemistry (IHC) section of the laboratory.
1. RESPONSIBILITY:
• It is the responsibility of trained laboratory personnel to perform
the ARGINASE-1 immunostain procedure following the protocols
outlined in this SOP.
• The laboratory supervisor is responsible for ensuring these
procedures are adhered to, providing training, overseeing quality
control measures and documenting any deviations or issues.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES:
• Automatic stainer, such as the Ventana BenchMark ULTRA
• Positive control tissues (normal liver tissue or known positive
control slides)
• Negative control tissues
• Microscope
• ARGINASE-1 primary antibody (commercially available)
◦ Manufacturer: [Insert manufacturer details]
◦ Optimal dilution: [Insert dilution details]
◦ Storage: As per manufacturer's instructions (typical storage at
2-8°C)
• Detection system and visualization reagent appropriate for IHC
◦ [Insert detection system details]
• Counterstain (e.g., hematoxylin)
• Mounting medium
• Coverslips
• Slides (prepared with tissue sections)
1. SPECIMEN:
• Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue sections, 4-5
µm thick, mounted on positively charged slides.
1. PROCEDURE:
A. Preparation:
1. Review requisition and patient/sample information.
2. Retrieve slides, ensuring proper identification and labels.
3. Check the ARGINASE-1 primary antibody stock for expiration
date and condition. Prepare the working solution of the primary
antibody as per manufacturer’s recommended dilution.
B. Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
1. Load FFPE tissue slides into automated stainer.
2. Using the automated stainer, program the deparaffinization
sequence (typically involving xylene or xylene substitutes
followed by graded alcohols to water).
C. Antigen Retrieval:
1. Program the stainer for antigen retrieval as recommended by
the primary antibody manufacturer.
◦ Heat-induced Epitope Retrieval (HIER) method, such as
using citrate buffer (pH 6.0) or EDTA buffer (pH 9.0).
D. Immunostaining:
1. Load the primary antibody, detection system reagents, and any
necessary buffer solutions into the automated stainer.
2. Program the stainer for primary antibody incubation at room
temperature (typically 30-60 minutes, as per manufacturer’s
instructions).
3. Run the detection system and visualization reagents as
programmed. This typically involves:
◦ Application of secondary antibody linked to an enzyme or
fluorophore.
◦ Visualization using DAB (Diaminobenzidine) or other
chromogenic substrates.
E. Counterstaining:
1. Program the automated stainer to apply the counterstain (e.g.,
hematoxylin) and water rinse.
F. Mounting:
1. Following the staining procedure, remove slides from the
stainer.
2. Dehydrate the slides through graded alcohols to xylene.
3. Apply mounting medium and coverslip.
Note: Ensure all mounts are properly labeled and documented.
G. Quality Control:
1. Run a known positive control alongside patient samples.
2. Include a negative control by omitting the primary antibody from
a separate section of tissue.
3. Evaluate both controls and document results.
4. REPORTING RESULTS:
• Results should be reviewed microscopically by a certified
histotechnologist or pathologist.
• Only the technical component is assessed in this protocol.
Interpretation is performed separately by qualified personnel.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING:
• If the positive control fails:
◦ Verify antibody concentration and method of preparation.
◦ Check antigen retrieval process and machinery for any
malfunctions.
• If non-specific staining occurs:
◦ Review dilution and blocking steps.
◦ Evaluate the integrity of reagents used.

CLIA compliance guidelines.
1. REVISION HISTORY:
• Document changes and updates to this SOP with dates and
signatures of responsible personnel.
