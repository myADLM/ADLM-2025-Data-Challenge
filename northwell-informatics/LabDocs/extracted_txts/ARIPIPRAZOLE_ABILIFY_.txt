Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Generating Results for
Aripiprazole (Abilify)
1. PURPOSE
This SOP provides a standardized procedure for generating accurate
and reliable analytical results for Aripiprazole (Abilify) in patient
specimens. These results are essential for therapeutic drug
monitoring and help guide clinical decisions regarding dosage and
treatment efficacy.
Responsibility:
All laboratory personnel involved in the analysis and reporting of
Aripiprazole results must follow this SOP to ensure consistency and
accuracy. It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory staff to
perform the analysis and document any deviations or corrective
actions taken during the analytical phase.
1. DEFINITIONS
Aripiprazole: A psychotropic agent used in the treatment of
schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depressive disorder.
Analytical Phase: The phase of laboratory testing that includes the
preparation of the specimen, performance of the analytical method,
and generation of results.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Acceptable Specimens:
• Plasma or serum collected using standard collection tubes
(preferably SST or heparinized tubes).
• Minimum volume of 2 mL is required for analysis.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens exceeding the stability period.
• Specimens with visible hemolysis or contamination.
• Specimens collected in anticoagulants other than heparin.
Stability:
• Specimens are stable at room temperature for up to 24 hours.
• Specimens can be refrigerated (2-8°C) for up to 3 days.
• For long-term storage (>3 days), specimens should be frozen at
-20°C.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Chromatographic system (HPLC or LC-MS/MS)
• Refrigerators and Freezers for sample storage
• Calibration curve software
Reagents:
• Mobile phase solvents
• Calibrators and quality control samples
• Internal standards for Aripiprazole
Supplies:
• Collection tubes (SST or heparinized)
• Sample vials
• Pipettes and tips
• Centrifuge
1. PROCEDURE
Sample Preparation:
1. Ensure specimen integrity and proper labeling.
2. Centrifuge the specimen at 1500-2000 x g for 10 minutes to
separate plasma or serum.
3. Pipette 1 mL of the supernatant into a labeled sample vial.
4. Add internal standard to the specimen (according to laboratory
protocol).
5. Mix thoroughly and proceed with chromatographic analysis.
Chromatographic Analysis:
1. Set up the chromatographic system according to manufacturer
specifications.
2. Create a calibration curve using known concentrations of
Aripiprazole.
3. Inject prepared sample into the chromatograph.
4. Analyze the sample and generate a chromatogram.
5. Use software to quantify the concentration of Aripiprazole
based on the calibration curve.
Quality Control:
1. Run quality control samples with each batch of patient
specimens.
2. Ensure results of quality control samples are within acceptable
limits.
3. Document the quality control results and any corrective actions
taken.
4. REPORTING RESULTS
5. Review chromatographic data for accuracy and consistency.
6. Verify the calculated concentration of Aripiprazole.
7. Compare results against therapeutic reference intervals:
◦ Therapeutic range: 100–1000 ng/mL
8. Record and report results in the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
9. Notify the physician of any critical values or deviations from the
therapeutic range.
Critical Results:
• Critical values (<100 ng/mL or >1000 ng/mL) must be
communicated immediately to the responsible clinician.
• Document the communication and any subsequent actions taken.
1. QUALITY ASSURANCE
Calibration and Maintenance:
1. Calibrate the chromatographic equipment monthly.
2. Perform routine maintenance and troubleshoot any issues.
3. Document all calibration and maintenance activities.
Verification:
1. Validate the procedure annually or whenever significant
changes are made.
2. Perform inter-laboratory comparisons as part of proficiency
testing.

• Current clinical guidelines for therapeutic drug monitoring of
Aripiprazole.
