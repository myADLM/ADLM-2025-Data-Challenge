Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Arrhythmogenic Cardiomyopathy Gene Panel
1. PURPOSE
To provide a comprehensive and standardized protocol for the
analytical phase involved in the processing and generating results for
the Arrhythmogenic Cardiomyopathy Gene Panel.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of designated laboratory personnel to conduct,
document, and verify all analytical testing procedures accurately and
efficiently. All staff must ensure the integrity of specimens and the
accuracy of results, notifying the supervisor of any irregularities
immediately.
1. DEFINITION
Arrhythmogenic Cardiomyopathy Gene Panel testing involves the
analysis of specific genes associated with arrhythmogenic
cardiomyopathy to identify potential genetic mutations responsible for
the condition.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Instrumentation and Equipment:
• DNA Extraction Kit
• Real-Time PCR Machine
• Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) Platform
• Thermal Cycler
• Microcentrifuge
• Pipettes and Tips
• Agarose Gel Electrophoresis Apparatus
B. Reagents and Supplies:
• Specimen: Patients’ extracted DNA samples
• Primers and Probes specific for Arrhythmogenic Cardiomyopathy
genes
• Library Preparation Kit for NGS
• Sequencing Reagents and Buffers
• Ethanol and Purification Columns
• Distilled Water
• DNA Ladder for Gel Electrophoresis
C. DNA Extraction:
1. Follow the manufacturer’s protocol for the DNA extraction kit.
2. Verify the concentration and purity of extracted DNA using a
spectrophotometer.
3. Record all relevant data in the DNA Extraction Log.
D. PCR Amplification:
1. Prepare the PCR Master Mix according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
2. Add specific primers and probes for the Arrhythmogenic
Cardiomyopathy genes.
3. Add extracted DNA to the PCR Master Mix.
4. Load the PCR mixture into the real-time PCR machine.
5. Perform thermal cycling under appropriate conditions (e.g.,
95°C for 10 minutes, followed by 40 cycles of 95°C for 15
seconds and 60°C for 1 minute).
6. Record and analyze amplification data.
E. Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS):
1. Prepare libraries using the library preparation kit as per the
manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Quantify the prepared libraries and pool them accordingly.
3. Load the pooled libraries onto the NGS platform.
4. Perform sequencing according to the platform's user manual.
5. Monitor the sequencing run and ensure all quality control
measures are met.
F. Data Analysis:
1. Use appropriate bioinformatic tools to analyze raw sequencing
data.
2. Identify genetic variants by aligning the reads to the reference
genome.
3. Filter and prioritize variants based on known arrhythmogenic
cardiomyopathy-related mutations.
4. Annotate the variants using available databases (e.g., ClinVar,
HGMD).
5. Interpret the clinical significance of the identified variants.
G. Quality Control:
1. Include positive and negative controls in each run to validate
the assay.
2. Perform repeat testing if results are ambiguous or controls fail.
3. Document all QC data in the QA/QC Log.
H. Reporting Results:
1. Compile the annotated and interpreted results into a
comprehensive report.
2. Verify the results by another qualified lab personnel.
3. Ensure that the results are reviewed and approved by a
laboratory supervisor or pathologist.
4. Communicate the finalized report to the requesting physician or
clinician.
5. SPECIMEN HANDLING:
• Ensure all patient specimens are correctly labeled and stored.
• Use appropriate refrigeration or freezing conditions as specified.
• Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles which may degrade DNA
quality.

1. TROUBLESHOOTING:
• If PCR amplification fails, check the integrity of primers and
probes, and confirm proper thermal cycling conditions.
• If NGS yields poor quality data, verify library preparation steps
and sequencing reagent integrity.
• Consult the supervisor immediately for any unresolved issues.
1. SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS:
• Follow all laboratory safety protocols.
• Use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) at all times.
• Handle all biological specimens as per biosafety guidelines.
This protocol ensures a standardized approach to the analytical
processes involved in generating results for the Arrhythmogenic
Cardiomyopathy Gene Panel, thereby ensuring the accuracy and
reliability of the diagnostic outcomes.
