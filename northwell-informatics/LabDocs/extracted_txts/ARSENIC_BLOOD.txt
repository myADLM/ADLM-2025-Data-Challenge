Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical
Phase of Generating Results for Arsenic, Blood
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to outline the steps necessary for
the accurate and timely analysis and reporting of arsenic levels in
blood samples.
Responsibility:
• Designated staff are responsible for performing the analysis
following this procedure.
• The laboratory supervisor is responsible for ensuring compliance
with this procedure and for resolving any issues that arise during
the analytical phase.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type:
• Whole blood (venous or arterial) collected in a trace element-free
tube.
Specimen Volume:
• A minimum of 2 mL of whole blood is required for analysis.
Specimen Handling and Stability:
• Blood specimens should be collected in EDTA (lavender top)
tubes.
• Specimens should be transported to the laboratory immediately.
• If delayed, refrigerate the specimen at 2-8°C and analyze within 7
days of collection. Specimens can also be stored frozen at -20°C
for up to 1 month if necessary.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer (ICP-MS)
• Centrifuge
• Laboratory fume hood
• Pipettes
Reagents:
• Nitric acid (trace metal grade)
• Arsenic standard solutions
• Deionized water (18.2 MΩ.cm resistivity)
• Internal standard solution (e.g., rhodium or indium)
1. PROCEDURE
A) Sample Preparation:
1. Sample Preparation:
◦ Thaw frozen blood samples at room temperature.
◦ Vigorously mix whole blood specimens using a vortex mixer
to ensure homogeneity.
2. Digestion:
◦ Place 0.5 mL of whole blood in a digestion vessel.
◦ Add 3 mL of nitric acid to the vessel.
◦ Conduct digestion using a microwave digestion system
according to the manufacturer's instructions.
3. Dilution:
◦ After digestion, transfer the digested sample to a 50 mL
volumetric flask and dilute to volume with deionized water.
4. Internal Standard:
◦ Add an aliquot of internal standard solution to each sample,
calibration standard, and quality control sample.
B) Instrument Calibration and Quality Control:
1. Calibration:
◦ Prepare a series of arsenic standards in a range appropriate
for expected sample concentrations (e.g., 0, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50
μg/L).
◦ Analyze these standards to create a calibration curve.
2. Quality Control:
◦ Run quality control samples at low, medium, and high
concentrations with each batch of samples.
◦ Include procedural blanks, fortified blanks, and matrix
spiked samples to ensure accuracy and precision.
C) Sample Analysis Using ICP-MS:
1. Optimization and Tuning:
◦ Optimize and tune the ICP-MS according to the
manufacturer's guidelines and standard operating conditions
for arsenic determination.
◦ Ensure a stable plasma, consistent sample introduction
system, and clean background readings.
2. Sample Introduction:
◦ Introduce each digested and diluted blood sample into the
ICP-MS detector.
◦ Analyze the signal intensity for both arsenic and the internal
standard.
3. Data Acquisition:
◦ Acquire data for the target arsenic isotope (e.g., m/z 75).
◦ Ensure the internal standard performs within acceptable
limits during data acquisition.
4. Quantification:
◦ Calculate the concentration of arsenic in the blood samples
using the calibration curve and applying appropriate dilution
factors.
D) Data Analysis and Reporting:
1. Data Analysis:
◦ Review and validate the data obtained from the ICP-MS.
◦ Ensure that all QA/QC samples fall within acceptable limits.
2. Result Calculation:
◦ Incorporate necessary dilution factors and report the
concentration of arsenic in µg/L.
3. Reporting:
◦ Document the results in the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
◦ Results requiring immediate medical attention due to
elevated arsenic levels should be communicated to the
relevant healthcare provider promptly.
4. QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE
• Routine internal quality controls will be analyzed with each batch
of patient samples.
• Proficiency testing should be performed as per the external
quality assessment scheme guidelines.
• Instrument maintenance and calibration logs should be
maintained and reviewed regularly.
1. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS
• All laboratory procedures involving blood specimens should follow
universal precautions.
• Proper safety measures, including the use of personal protective
equipment (PPE) and functioning fume hoods, should be in place.
• Handling and disposal of nitric acid and other hazardous materials
should follow laboratory safety protocols.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS AND LIMITATIONS
• Reference Interval:
◦ Normal arsenic levels in blood: <10 µg/L
• Limitations:
◦ Potential interferences from other elements should be
monitored and corrected.

in biological specimens.
This SOP ensures accurate and reproducible analysis of arsenic in
blood, adhering to clinical and regulatory standards. Staff must be
trained and competent in the use of ICP-MS and aware of the safety
procedures for handling blood and hazardous chemicals.
