Standard Operating Procedure: Analytical Phase for Generating
Results for ARSENIC/CREATININE RATIO, URINE
1. PURPOSE To provide a standardized protocol for the analysis
and generation of results for the arsenic/creatinine ratio in urine
samples.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for
performing the analysis according to this SOP. It is the responsibility
of all staff to bring any concerns regarding the procedure to the
attention of a supervisor.
1. DEFINITION Arsenic/Creatinine Ratio, Urine: The quantification
of arsenic and creatinine in urine to determine the arsenic
exposure adjusted for urine concentration.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred Specimen: 10 mL of urine.
• Specimen must be collected in a clean, dry container with no
preservatives.
• Acceptable Specimen: Urine collected in a BD Vacutainer
Urinalysis Preservative Conical Urine tube. Specimens in these
tubes are stable for up to 72 hrs at 4-25°C with an ideal volume of
7-9 ml.
• Unacceptable Specimens:
◦ Specimens arriving in the lab greater than 24 hours after
collection.
◦ Specimens with no collection date/time indicated on the
sample container or requisition.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) (for
arsenic analysis)
• Automated Chemistry Analyzer (for creatinine analysis)
• Standard Calibration Solutions for arsenic and creatinine
• Quality Control Material
• Pipettes and Tips
• Sample Storage Containers
1. PROCEDURE
Sample Preparation: a. Ensure urine samples are well mixed before
aliquoting. b. Aliquot an appropriate volume (e.g., 2-3 mL) into a
labeled secondary container. c. Store samples at 4-8°C until analysis;
freeze at -20°C for longer term storage.
Arsenic Analysis: a. Prepare standard calibration solutions for
arsenic. b. Calibrate ICP-MS with standards and quality control
solutions. c. Perform a quality control check before analyst runs: -
Run low and high control samples. - Calculate coefficient of variation
(CV) to ensure it is within acceptable limits (<10%). d. Analyze the
urine samples using ICP-MS: - Insert prepared samples into the
autosampler. - Run samples and ensure acquisition parameters are
as documented. - Record and export the arsenic concentration for
each sample.
Creatinine Analysis: a. Prepare standard calibration solutions for
creatinine. b. Calibrate the automated chemistry analyzer with
standards and quality control solutions. c. Perform a quality control
check before analysis. d. Analyze the urine samples using the
chemistry analyzer: - Aliquot sample into chemistry analyzer cups. -
Run samples according to analyzer instructions. - Record and export
creatinine concentration for each sample.
Calculation of Ratio: a. Arsenic/Creatinine Ratio is calculated using
the formula: - Ratio (µg/g) = (Arsenic concentration in urine (µg/L) /
Creatinine concentration in urine (mg/L)) * 1000 b. Ensure all results
are documented and reviewed.
1. QUALITY CONTROL a. Run controls and ensure results are
within acceptable limits. b. Both arsenic and creatinine should
be checked against commercially available quality control
materials. c. Document all QC results including any corrective
actions taken if controls fall outside acceptable limits.
2. REPORTING RESULTS a. Results should be reviewed and
verified by the designated personnel. b. Results are
automatically transmitted to the Laboratory Information System
(LIS). c. Ensure that critical values are communicated
according to the established protocol.
3. REFERENCE INTERVALS Based on literature and lab-specific
validation:
• Arsenic: < 35 µg/L (may vary based on local standards)
• Creatinine: 20–250 mg/dL
• Arsenic/Creatinine Ratio: < 35 µg/g (adjust for diurnal variation
and hydration status)
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS Refer to instrument manuals and
product inserts for limitations specific to ICP-MS and chemistry
analyzer.
