Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Analytical Phase: ARSENIC/
CREATININE RATIO, WITH REFLEX, RANDOM, URINE
1. PURPOSE
To ensure accurate and timely analysis of arsenic and creatinine
levels in random urine sample, understand the arsenic exposure, and
provide the arsenic to creatinine ratio with reflex testing as
appropriate.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory staff will perform the arsenic
and creatinine analysis, document results, and initiate reflex testing
procedures when necessary.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/Acceptable Specimen:
• Random urine specimen collected in a clean, plastic container
• Minimum volume: 10 mL
• Properly labeled with patient identification, collection date, and
time
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Specimens received greater than 24 hours after collection
• Specimens with leaking or broken containers
• Specimens without proper labeling (missing patient identification,
collection date/time)
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer (ICP-MS) for
arsenic analysis
• Jaffe Reaction or Enzymatic Method for creatinine analysis
• Evidence of calibrated and quality checked equipment
• Control and calibration solutions specifically for arsenic and
creatinine
• Urine containers (clean, leak-proof)
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation of Samples:
1. Ensure urine sample is at room temperature before analysis.
2. Mix sample thoroughly to ensure homogeneity.
3. Aliquot 5 mL of urine into a clean, labeled test tube for arsenic
analysis.
4. Aliquot 5 mL of urine into a second clean, labeled test tube for
creatinine analysis.
B. Arsenic Analysis:
1. Prepare ICP-MS according to manufacturer’s instructions and
verify calibration.
2. Run control samples to ensure accuracy and precision;
document results.
3. Analyze urine sample for arsenic content; document
concentration (µg/L).
4. Record results in the laboratory information system (LIS).
C. Creatinine Analysis:
1. Prepare equipment according to manufacturer’s instructions
and verify calibration.
2. Run control samples using Jaffe Reaction or Enzymatic Method
as appropriate; document results.
3. Analyze urine sample for creatinine content; document
concentration (mg/dL).
4. Record results in LIS.
D. Calculation of Arsenic/Creatinine Ratio:
1. Calculate the ratio of arsenic (µg) to creatinine (mg) per liter.
2. Enter calculated ratio into LIS.
3. If arsenic/creatinine ratio exceeds predetermined threshold,
initiate reflex testing for further analysis.
E. Quality Control:
1. Run quality control samples with each batch of patient samples.
2. Verify that control samples fall within acceptable limits before
reporting patient results.
3. Document any corrective actions taken in case of quality control
failure.
4. Ensure equipment calibration and maintenance records are up
to date.
F. Reflex Testing:
1. If predetermined threshold for arsenic/creatinine ratio is
exceeded, follow specific reflex protocol to perform additional
testing as required.
2. Procedures for reflex testing will be guided by laboratory
guidelines and physician orders.
3. REPORTING RESULTS
4. All results must be reviewed and verified by a trained
technologist.
5. Document any critical values and follow lab-specific guidelines
for reporting critical results to the physician.
6. Ensure all data, including concentrations, ratio, and potential
reflex results, are accurately recorded in the LIS.
7. Promptly notify physician regarding results that exceed critical
threshold.

guidelines.
11. Relevant laboratory quality control and reflex testing guidelines.
12. METHOD LIMITATIONS
13. Hematuria and high concentrations of other metals may
interfere with arsenic measurements.
14. Accurate calculation of ratios requires precise creatinine
assays.
15. Reflex testing thresholds may vary based on clinical
requirements. Follow lab-specific protocols.
By adhering to this SOP, laboratory personnel can ensure reliable
and timely reporting of arsenic/creatinine ratio in random urine
samples, thus aiding physicians in assessing patient exposure to
arsenic.
