Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analysis of Arsenic in
Hair Samples
1. PURPOSE To outline the procedures for the analysis of arsenic in
hair samples in the laboratory. This SOP ensures accurate and
reliable results through careful handling, processing, analysis, and
documentation of hair samples for arsenic determination.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
• All laboratory staff trained in this procedure are responsible for
adherence to the protocol.
• The Supervisor is responsible for ensuring staff are trained and
the SOP is followed.
• Laboratory Technologists are responsible for completing the
analysis and documenting results accurately.
3. DEFINITION Arsenic analysis in hair samples is conducted to
measure arsenic exposure and potential toxicity. Hair provides a
historical record of arsenic exposure over time.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
• Preferred: 1-2 grams of hair, cut as close to the scalp as possible.
• Acceptance: Hair samples collected from different parts of the
scalp placed in separate containers.
• Stability: Ensure samples are kept dry and at room temperature.
Avoid contamination.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Clean, stainless steel scissors and forceps
• Polypropylene containers
• Nitric acid (70%)
• Hydrochloric acid (HCl)
• Deionized water
• Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer (ICP-MS) or
Atomic Absorption Spectrometer (AAS) with Hydride Generator
• Certified Arsenic standards
• Microwave digestion system
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) including gloves, lab coat,
and safety goggles
6. PROCEDURE A. Sample Preparation
1. Collection: Ensure hair samples are collected properly as per
guidelines mentioned.
2. Sample Labeling: Assign a unique identification number and
log sample in the laboratory information system.
3. Washing:
◦ Wash hair samples with non-ionic detergent, rinse with
deionized water, followed by washes in acetone and finally,
deionized water.
◦ Dry hair samples in a clean environment.
B. Digestion
1. Acid Digestion:
◦ Weigh 0.50 grams of the dried hair sample into a microwave
digestion vessel.
◦ Add 10 mL of concentrated nitric acid to the vessel.
◦ Seal the vessel and place it in the microwave digestion
system.
◦ Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for digestion cycle.
Ensure complete digestion with clear solution.
2. Post-Digestion:
◦ After cooling, transfer the digested solution to a 50 mL
polypropylene tube.
◦ Dilute to the mark with deionized water.
3. Quality Control:
◦ Include blanks, certified reference materials (CRMs), and
spiked samples with each batch.
C. Analysis
1. Instrument Calibration:
◦ Prepare calibration standards ranging from 0 to 100 ppb
using certified arsenic standards.
◦ Calibrate the ICP-MS or AAS as per the manufacturer’s
guidelines.
2. Sample Analysis:
◦ Analyze the digested hair samples using ICP-MS or AAS.
◦ Run quality control samples after every 10 samples to
ensure instrument accuracy.
3. Data Recording:
◦ Record all raw data and quality control results.
◦ Verify that all data points are within acceptable limits set by
the laboratory.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include blanks, CRMs, and a recovery check for each batch of
samples.
• Acceptable recovery range for QC samples should be 85-115%.
• Any deviations must be documented, and corrective actions taken
before proceeding.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Calculate arsenic concentration in hair samples in ppm or µg/g.
• All results must be reviewed, verified, and approved by a qualified
technologist before release.
• Report finalized results in the Laboratory Information System
(LIS) with appropriate reference ranges and comments if
necessary.
9. REFERENCE INTERVAL
• Reference intervals for arsenic in hair should be provided as per
the latest clinical guidelines.
10. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Potential contamination during sample collection and processing.
• Interference from other metals in the analytical procedure must be
accounted for and minimized.
