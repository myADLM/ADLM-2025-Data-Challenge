Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analysis of Arsenic in
Nails
1. PURPOSE
To define the procedure for the analysis of arsenic in nail
samples, ensuring accurate, precise, and reliable test results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
◦ Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for
performing the analysis according to this SOP.
◦ The laboratory manager/supervisor is responsible for
ensuring that all personnel are trained and comply with this
SOP.
3. SPECIMEN
◦ Preferred/Acceptable: Well-trimmed nail clippings, ideally
from multiple fingers/toes to obtain enough sample for
analysis (minimum 100 mg).
◦ Unacceptable: Nail clippings contaminated with external
substances (e.g., nail polish, dirt, etc.), insufficient sample
quantity (<50 mg), or degraded samples.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
◦ High-Resolution Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass
Spectrometer (HR-ICP-MS)
◦ Analytical balance (with readability of 0.001 mg)
◦ Clean laboratory glassware (beakers, flasks, etc.)
◦ Nitric acid (HNO3), trace metal grade
◦ Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), trace metal grade
◦ Deionized water (resistivity ≥18.2MΩ cm)
◦ Calibrated pipettes
◦ Certified Arsenic standard solutions for calibration
◦ Plastic tubes or containers for sample digestion
◦ Centrifuge (if necessary)
◦ Sample digestion system (microwave digestion unit or
hotplate digestion system)
◦ Disposable gloves, protective eyewear, and lab coat
5. SAMPLE PREPARATION
5.1 Cleaning Nails:
◦ Wear gloves throughout the process to avoid contamination.
◦ Manually clean nail samples with a soft brush and deionized
water.
◦ Air dry nail samples in a contamination-free environment.
5.2 Weighing Samples:
◦ Weigh approximately 100 mg of the cleaned nail samples on
an analytical balance.
◦ Record the weight to the nearest 0.001 mg.
5.3 Digestion:
◦ Transfer the weighed nail samples into clean digestion
vessels.
◦ Add 5 ml of nitric acid (HNO3) and 2 ml of hydrogen
peroxide (H2O2) to each vessel.
◦ Seal the digestion vessels and perform microwave digestion
according to the equipment manufacturer’s instructions.
▪ Alternatively, use a hotplate by placing the open
containers with samples and reagents on the hotplate
and gently heating until complete digestion is achieved.
◦ Allow the digestion mixture to cool before proceeding.
5.4 Dilution:
◦ Once cooled, carefully transfer the digested sample solution
to a volumetric flask and dilute to a final volume of 50 ml
with deionized water.
◦ Mix thoroughly.
6. CALIBRATION AND STANDARDIZATION
6.1 Preparation of Calibration Standards:
◦ Prepare a series of arsenic standard solutions ranging from
0.1 ppb to 10.0 ppb by diluting certified standard solutions
with nitric acid.
6.2 Calibration Process:
◦ Calibrate the HR-ICP-MS according to the manufacturer’s
instructions using the prepared standard solutions.
◦ Ensure the calibration curve meets laboratory acceptance
criteria (e.g., r² value ≥0.995).
7. ANALYSIS
◦ Analyze the prepared nail digests using the HR-ICP-MS.
◦ Run quality control checks with known quality control
samples and reagents to ensure accuracy.
◦ Use the appropriate settings on the HR-ICP-MS, including
using internal standards if required.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Analyze a blank sample (no nail, just reagents) to check for
contamination.
◦ Include matrix-matched quality control (QC) samples and
certified reference materials (CRMs) in every batch.
◦ Re-run samples if the QC fails to meet acceptance criteria.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ Ensure data integrity by reviewing all analytical data before
reporting.
◦ Calculate the arsenic concentration in the nail samples
using the calibration curve and dilution factor.
◦ Report results in micrograms of arsenic per gram of the nail
(µg/g).
◦ Reference expected reference limits for arsenic in nails
(typically <2.0 µg/g).
10. DOCUMENTATION
◦ Maintain detailed records of all samples, including weights,
digestion details, calibration logs, instrument settings, and
analytical results.
◦ Document any deviations from the protocol and corrective
actions taken.
