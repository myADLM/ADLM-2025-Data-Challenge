Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Arsenic Occupational Exposure,
Random, Urine
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedure for the analysis
and reporting of arsenic levels in random urine samples collected for
the assessment of occupational exposure to arsenic.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to the laboratory analysis of random urine samples
for arsenic levels using Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass
Spectrometry (ICP-MS).
3. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing the
analysis, maintaining quality control, and reporting results according
to this SOP.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
a. Specimen:
• Preferred/Acceptable:
◦ A minimum of 10 mL of random urine collected in a clean,
sterile container.
• Unacceptable:
◦ Specimens that are collected in containers with preservatives.
◦ Specimens less than the required volume.
◦ Specimens without proper labeling or collection date/time
information.
b. Stability:
• Specimens are stable for up to 24 hours at room temperature.
• To maintain stability beyond 24 hours, specimens must be
refrigerated at 2-8°C or frozen at -20°C.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
a. Equipment:
• Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer (ICP-MS)
• Analytical balance
• Centrifuge
• Acid-washed polypropylene tubes
• Micropipettes and tips
• Vortex mixer
• Refrigerator (2-8°C), Freezer (-20°C)
b. Reagents:
• Nitric acid (concentrated, trace metal grade)
• Deionized water (high purity)
• Certified multi-element standard solution for calibration
• Internal standard solution (e.g., Rhodium or Indium)
6. PROCEDURE
a. Sample Preparation:
1. Sample Receipt:
◦ Verify that the urine samples are properly labeled and meet
the acceptance criteria.
◦ Note the date and time of receipt.
2. Sample Handling:
◦ Mix the urine sample thoroughly by gentle inversion.
◦ Aliquot 5 mL of the well-mixed urine sample into an acid-
washed polypropylene tube.
◦ Add 0.5 mL of concentrated nitric acid to the aliquoted urine
sample.
◦ Vortex the sample for 1 minute to ensure complete mixing.
◦ Centrifuge the sample at 2000 g for 10 minutes to remove
any particulates.
b. Calibration and Quality Control:
1. Calibration Curve Preparation:
◦ Prepare a calibration curve using the certified multi-element
standard solution. The calibration should include at least five
points covering the expected range of concentrations.
2. Internal Standard:
◦ Add the internal standard solution to all samples, calibration
standards, and quality control samples to monitor and
correct for instrument drift and matrix effects.
3. Quality Control:
◦ Analyze quality control samples at multiple concentration
levels (low, medium, high) along with each batch of patient
samples.
◦ Run a blank solution between samples to check for
carryover.
c. Instrument Analysis:
1. ICP-MS Analysis:
◦ Set up the ICP-MS according to the manufacturer's
instructions for urine analysis.
◦ Introduce the prepared samples, calibration standards, and
quality control samples into the ICP-MS.
◦ Monitor the internal standard response and ensure it
remains within the acceptable range.
◦ Perform data acquisition and ensure appropriate peak
integration for arsenic.
d. Data Analysis and Reporting:
1. Data Review:
◦ Verify that the calibration curve and quality control samples
meet the acceptance criteria.
◦ Quantify the arsenic concentration in urine samples using
the calibration curve.
◦ Review the internal standard recovery, ensuring it is within
±20% of the expected value.
2. Result Calculation:
◦ Calculate the final concentration of arsenic in µg/L
(micrograms per liter).
3. Reporting:
◦ Document the results in the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
◦ Include the following information in the report:
▪ Patient identification
▪ Date and time of sample collection
▪ Arsenic concentration (µg/L)
▪ Analytical method used
▪ Any pertinent comments or notes
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform routine instrument maintenance and calibration as per
manufacturer recommendations.
• Analyze control samples (low, medium, high) with each analytical
run.
• Review control charts and take corrective action if control results
are outside acceptable limits.
• Participate in proficiency testing programs to compare results with
peer laboratories.
8. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS
• Handle all specimens with appropriate personal protective
equipment (PPE) including gloves, lab coat, and safety glasses.
• Use fume hoods when working with concentrated acids.
• Dispose of waste according to laboratory safety protocols and
local regulations.

• Manufacturer’s manual for ICP-MS.
• Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines.
10. DOCUMENT CONTROL
Maintain this SOP under the document control system with periodic
reviews and updates as necessary.
