STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE
ARSENIC OCCUPATIONAL EXPOSURE, WITH REFLEX,
RANDOM, URINE
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for the analysis and generation of results for
arsenic exposure in randomly collected urine specimens as part of
occupational health monitoring. This SOP will include the primary
analysis for total arsenic and reflex testing as necessary.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all laboratory staff to adhere to the
procedures outlined in this document. Staff must ensure sample
integrity, perform required analyses, and document results accurately.
Supervisors must ensure all staff members are trained on this SOP.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type:
• Random urine specimen
Specimen Volume:
• Minimum 10 mL
Specimen Collection and Handling:
• The specimen must be collected in a clean, dry, plastic container.
• Avoid contamination with external sources of arsenic.
• Store and transport specimens at room temperature.
• Specimens must be tested within 24 hours of collection. If
delayed, store specimens at 2-8°C for up to 72 hours.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens with preservatives
• Specimens with significant contamination or improper labeling
• Specimens exceeding the stability period without proper storage
4. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• ICP-MS (Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry) system
• Certified arsenic standards for calibration
• Quality control materials
• Chemical reagents: nitric acid, deionized water, and others as
specified by the manufacturer
• Appropriate sample containers and pipettes
5. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation and Calibration
1. Prepare reagents and standards as specified in the ICP-MS
user's manual.
2. Calibrate the ICP-MS daily before processing any samples
using certified arsenic standards.
3. Verify calibration using quality control materials, ensuring their
concentrations fall within acceptable limits.
B. Sample Preparation
1. Mix the urine specimen thoroughly before aliquoting.
2. Aliquot 1 mL of urine into a labeled sample tube.
3. Add appropriate volume of nitric acid to the sample for digestion
(if applicable) per the laboratory protocol.
4. Allow samples to stand at room temperature for a specified
digestion period if using chemical digestion.
C. Analysis
1. Load samples and standards into the ICP-MS autosampler
according to the manufacturer's instructions.
2. Run the samples under the specified instrument parameters for
arsenic detection.
3. Ensure the system's internal quality control checks are
satisfactory before releasing results.
4. For each sample, record the total arsenic concentration in µg/L.
D. Reflex Testing
1. If the total arsenic concentration exceeds the occupational
threshold (e.g., 35 µg/L), proceed with reflex testing.
2. Perform speciation analysis if required to differentiate between
organic and inorganic arsenic using chromatographic
separation techniques coupled with ICP-MS.
3. Document the reflex testing procedure and results promptly.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include quality control samples with each batch of patient
samples.
• Acceptable ranges for QC samples must be established and
followed strictly.
• If QC results fall outside acceptable ranges, investigate and
resolve the issue before reporting patient results.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
A. Total Arsenic:
1. Report total arsenic concentrations in µg/L.
2. Results will be transmitted to the Laboratory Information
System (LIS) and must be reviewed and verified by the
technologist before release.
B. Reflex Testing (if performed):
1. Report inorganic arsenic concentrations if reflex testing is
performed.
2. Include a comment if speciation was performed and provide
necessary values and interpretations.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• High creatinine levels may interfere with measurements.
• Ensure accurate and consistent sample handling to avoid
contamination and degradation.
• Reflex testing requires additional resources and can extend
turnaround time.

10. REVIEW AND DOCUMENTATION
• This SOP must be reviewed annually and updated as necessary.
• Documentation of review must be kept on file including any
amendments made.
