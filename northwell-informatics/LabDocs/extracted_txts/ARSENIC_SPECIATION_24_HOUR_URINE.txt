ARSENIC SPECIATION, 24 HOUR, URINE ANALYTICAL PHASE
PROTOCOL
1. PURPOSE To outline the procedure for the accurate and
precise analysis of arsenic speciation in 24-hour urine samples
utilizing liquid chromatography-inductively coupled plasma
mass spectrometry (LC-ICP-MS).
Responsibility: It is the responsibility of the trained laboratory staff to
follow this protocol to ensure accurate results are generated. All staff
are responsible for notifying a supervisor of any discrepancies or
equipment malfunctions.
1. DEFINITION Arsenic speciation identifies different chemical
forms of arsenic, which aids in understanding exposure sources
and potential health effects.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS Preferred/acceptable:
• 24-hour urine collection without preservation.
• Collection container must be labelled with patient ID, start and
end collection times.
Unacceptable:
• Urine samples collected for less than 24 hours.
• Samples with any damage or contamination.
• Containers without patient ID or time labels, or incorrect labeling
Note: Ensure samples are refrigerated during collection and
transport, in cases where the samples arrive at ambient temperature,
stabilize them immediately in a refrigerator before analysis.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• LC-ICP-MS System
• Sample preparation equipment (centrifuge, pipettes, vials)
• Standard solutions for arsenic species
• Mobile phase solvents for LC
• Calibration standards and Quality Control material
1. PROCEDURE Pre-analysis:
2. Verify patient identification and sample integrity.
3. Record the total urine volume in the collection container.
4. Aliquot appropriate urine fractions into pre-labeled vials.
5. Centrifuge the aliquots at approximately 3000 rpm for 10
minutes to remove any particulate matter; transfer the
supernatant to clean vials.
Preparation of Standards:
1. Prepare arsenic standard solutions in mobile phase solvents as
per manufacturer protocols. Include standards for arsenite
(AsIII), arsenate (AsV), dimethylarsinic acid (DMA), and
monomethylarsonic acid (MMA).
2. Prepare Quality Control samples and calibrators alongside the
test samples.
LC-ICPMS Analysis:
1. Load samples, calibration standards, and QC materials onto the
LC-ICP-MS autosampler.
2. Set parameters for LC separation according to standard
method guidelines: flow rate, gradient elution program, and
column type.
3. Set ICP-MS parameters: RF power, lens settings, collision/
reaction cell settings, and dwell time for arsenic isotopes.
4. Initiate run sequence; include blanks, QCs, and calibration
standards at regular intervals.
Post-analysis:
1. Review chromatograms and integrate peaks corresponding to
arsenic species.
2. Verify the linearity of calibration curves and ensure QC samples
are within acceptable limits.
3. Calculate the concentration of each arsenic species in the urine
sample. Multiply results to reflect the total 24-hour urine
volume.
4. Record results in LIS and verify before releasing final report.
5. Repeat any samples with noted discrepancies or poor quality
control performance.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run at least two levels of QC samples with every batch.
• Verify daily calibration curves for accuracy.
• Reprocess any batch where QC results fail to meet acceptable
criteria.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results are automatically transmitted to LIS and require
verification by the responsible technologist.
• Positive/negative controls must validate the assay before results
release.
• Notify clinician of any critical arsenic speciation levels as per site-
specific guidelines.
1. REFERENCES Utilize instrument manuals, manufacturer's
guidelines, and peer-reviewed standard methods for arsenic
speciation, ensuring the most current practices are adhered to.
This protocol ensures a standardized approach to the analysis of
arsenic speciation in 24-hour urine samples, providing reliable and
accurate patient results.
