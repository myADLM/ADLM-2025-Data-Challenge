Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Arsenic Speciation, Random, Urine
1. PURPOSE To outline the steps involved in the analytical phase of
generating results for arsenic speciation in random urine samples.
The procedure ensures accurate identification and quantification of
arsenic species to aid in clinical diagnosis and monitoring.
2. SPECIMEN
Preferred/Acceptable Specimen:
• Random urine sample, collected in a clean, plastic container
without preservatives.
• Preferred volume: At least 10 mL.
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Specimens contaminated with feces or other foreign materials.
• Specimens collected in containers with additives or preservatives.
• Specimens arriving in the laboratory greater than 24 hours after
collection or without proper documentation of the collection date
and time.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) coupled to
Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS)
• Clean plastic urine containers
• Volumetric pipettes
• Centrifuge
• Calibration standards for different arsenic species
• Control samples (positive and negative)
• Appropriate solvents and mobile phases for HPLC
4. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Verify the specimen integrity and completeness of the
documentation.
2. Centrifuge the urine sample at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes to
remove particulates.
3. Transfer the supernatant to a clean centrifuge tube.
Calibration and Quality Control:
1. Prepare calibration standards for the arsenic species at various
concentrations.
2. Run quality control samples to ensure the accuracy of the
system setup.
◦ Include both positive and negative control samples.
◦ Record the results and ensure they are within acceptable
ranges.
Chromatographic Separation:
1. Set up the HPLC system according to manufacturer
instructions.
2. Prepare the mobile phase as specified in the method.
3. Load the urine sample into the HPLC auto-sampler.
4. Perform the chromatographic separation following the specified
method parameters: flow rate, column type, and temperature
settings.
Detection and Quantification:
1. Connect the ICP-MS to the HPLC system.
2. Ensure that the ICP-MS is properly calibrated and ready for
analysis.
3. Inject the separated sample into the ICP-MS for detection.
4. Identify and quantify the arsenic species present in the urine
sample based on the calibration curve.
Result Interpretation:
1. Compare the detected levels of each arsenic species against
established reference intervals.
2. Validate the results by reviewing the control sample outcomes.
3. Perform any necessary repeat tests if control sample results
are inconsistent.
Reporting:
1. Enter the quantified results into the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
2. Ensure that the report indicates the specific arsenic species
detected and their concentrations.
3. Verify and release the results to the authorized personnel with
necessary comments if the sample integrity was questionable
or if there were any analytical issues.
Critical Results:
• Establish a list of critical arsenic levels that necessitate immediate
reporting to the requesting physician.
• Document and follow the protocol for reporting critical results
including phone calls and emails as needed.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
Materials:
• Quality control samples: positive (known arsenic concentrations)
and negative (blank sample).
• Calibration standards with known concentrations of the arsenic
species.
Procedures:
1. Run quality control samples periodically (e.g., daily) and after
system maintenance or calibration.
2. Record all quality control data and take corrective action if
results fall outside the acceptable ranges.
6. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to HPLC-ICP-MS system manual and arsenic speciation kit
insert for any method-specific limitations.
• Note and document any matrix effects or interferences.
7. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's protocol for the HPLC-ICP-MS system.
• Clinical guidelines for arsenic speciation.
• Peer-reviewed articles on arsenic speciation methods.
• Arsenic speciation kit insert/reference guide.
