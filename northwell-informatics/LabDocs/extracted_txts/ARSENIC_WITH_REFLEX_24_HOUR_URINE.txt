Title: Analytical Phase Protocol for Generating Results for
Arsenic with Reflex, 24 Hour, Urine
Effective Date: [Insert Date]
Review Date: [Insert Date]
Document No: [Insert Document Number]
Version: 1.0
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedures and responsibilities for the analytical
testing of "Arsenic with Reflex, 24 Hour, Urine" to ensure accurate
and timely results, consistent with CLIA regulations and standards.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all staff members involved in the analysis, data
interpretation, and validation of urine samples tested for arsenic in a
CLIA-certified laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Laboratory Technologists: Perform the analysis as per the
defined procedures and document results accurately.
• Supervisors: Ensure compliance with the SOP and address any
issues or deviations from the procedure.
• Quality Assurance/Control Staff: Validate and monitor all
analytical procedures and equipment related to this SOP.
4. DEFINITIONS
• Arsenic (As): A toxic element that can be detected in urine
samples.
• Reflex Testing: Additional testing conducted when initial results
indicate values that meet predetermined criteria.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer (ICP-MS) or
Graphite Furnace Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (GFAAS)
• Calibrated Pipettes and Volumetric Flasks
• Certified Clean Containers for Sample Preparation
• High-purity Reagents (e.g., Nitric Acid, Hydrochloric Acid)
• Quality Control Materials (Two levels: Normal and Elevated)
• Laboratory Information System (LIS) for data recording
6. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: 24-hour urine collection
• Collection Instructions: Collect urine over 24 hours in a clean
container. Refrigerate during collection. Avoid contamination with
external sources of arsenic.
• Specimen Stability: Stable frozen at -20°C for up to 1 year.
• Acceptability Criteria: Properly labeled with patient information,
collection start and end time, and free of visible contamination.
7. PROCEDURE
7.1. PREPARATION
1. Sample Reception:
◦ Check specimen labeling and acceptability criteria.
◦ Log specimens into the LIS.
2. Preparation of Reagents:
◦ Prepare high-purity reagents as per standard preparation
procedures.
◦ Verify the integrity and expiration dates of all reagents.
7.2. ANALYSIS
1. Initial Arsenic Quantification:
◦ Load the urine samples, quality control materials, and
calibration standards onto the ICP-MS or GFAAS.
◦ Perform a calibration check using known standards and
ensure the calibration curve is within acceptable limits.
◦ Analyze the urine samples following the manufacturer’s
operational guidelines for ICP-MS or GFAAS.
2. Quality Control:
◦ Run quality control samples after every batch of patient
samples.
◦ Ensure quality control results are within predefined
acceptable ranges before reporting any patient results.
◦ Document all QC results in the Quality Control Log.
7.3. REFLEX TESTING
1. Criteria for Reflex Testing:
◦ If the total arsenic value exceeds the laboratory-established
threshold, initiate reflex testing for speciation.
◦ Speciation involves separating organic and inorganic forms
of arsenic.
2. Performing Reflex Testing:
◦ Process an aliquot of the original sample using High-
Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) coupled with
ICP-MS for inorganic arsenic speciation.
◦ Follow detailed instructions in the HPLC-ICP-MS SOP for
sample analysis.
7.4. RESULT VERIFICATION AND REPORTING
1. Data Interpretation:
◦ Review all analytical data for consistency and accuracy.
◦ Verify that all control material results are valid.
2. Result Entry:
◦ Enter results into the LIS.
◦ Reflex test results should be linked appropriately to the
original test results in the LIS.
3. Supervisory Review:
◦ Forward results to the designated supervisor for final review
and validation.
◦ Document any deviations or corrective actions taken during
the analysis.
4. Reporting:
◦ Once validated, results are released to the electronic
medical records system.
◦ Notify the physician of critical values as per laboratory
policy.
8. QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE
1. Internal Quality Control:
◦ Three levels of control materials should be run daily.
◦ Document all control material results and ensure
compliance with predefined criteria.
2. External Quality Control:
◦ Participate in proficiency testing programs as required by
regulatory agencies.
◦ Review and document results from proficiency testing.
