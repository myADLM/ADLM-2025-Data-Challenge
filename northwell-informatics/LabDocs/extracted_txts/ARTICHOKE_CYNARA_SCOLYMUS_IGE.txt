Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for ARTICHOKE
(CYNARA SCOLYMUS) IGE Analysis
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this document is to outline the analytical procedures
for the detection and quantification of Immunoglobulin E (IgE) specific
to Artichoke (Cynara scolymus) in serum samples. This protocol
ensures accuracy, reproducibility, and reliability of the test results.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for adhering to
this procedure, performing the assays, and ensuring proper
documentation.
• Supervisors must ensure that all personnel are trained and
competent in executing these procedures.
1. DEFINITION
This SOP covers the procedures required to measure the level of IgE
specific to Artichoke (Cynara scolymus) in human serum. The
instrument used for analysis will be detailed below.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred/acceptable: Serum collected in a serum separator
tube (SST).
• Unacceptable: Specimens collected in anticoagulants (e.g.,
EDTA, heparin, or citrate).
Storage: The serum should be separated from blood cells within 2
hours of collection and stored at 2-8°C if analyzed within 7 days. For
longer storage, keep at -20°C.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• ELISA (Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay) kit for
ARTICHOKE (CYNARA SCOLYMUS) IGE
• Microplate reader capable of reading at 450 nm (reference filter
620-650 nm)
• Micropipettes (1-1000 µL) and pipette tips
• Multichannel pipette (if available)
• Calibrated traceable thermometer and equipment for temperature
control
• Disposable gloves
• Vortex mixer
• Deionized water
• Serum controls (positive and negative)
• Wash buffer
• Substrate solution
• Stop solution
1. PROCEDURE
2. Preparation:
◦ All reagents and samples should be brought to room
temperature (20-25°C) before use.
◦ Ensure all equipment such as the microplate reader and
micropipettes are calibrated and functioning correctly.
3. Dilution of Specimens:
◦ Dilute serum specimens and controls with the sample
diluent according to the manufacturer’s instructions, typically
1:10 dilution (10 µL of serum + 90 µL of diluent).
4. Assay Procedure:
◦ Sample Application: a. Pipette 100 µL of diluted standards,
controls, and specimens into the appropriate wells. b.
Ensure all steps are done in duplicate (at least) for accuracy.
◦ Incubation: a. Incubate the plate for 1 hour at 37°C in an
incubator or as specified in the kit insert.
◦ Washing: a. Wash the wells with the wash buffer (as
specified), typically about 4-5 times. Thoroughly tap the
plate to remove residual liquid post-wash.
◦ Detection Antibody: a. Add 100 µL of anti-IgE HRP-
conjugate into each well. b. Incubate for 30 minutes at room
temperature.
◦ Washing: a. Repeat the washing steps as previously
described.
◦ Substrate Addition: a. Add 100 µL of TMB substrate
solution into each well. b. Incubate for 15-20 minutes in the
dark at room temperature.
◦ Stopping Reaction: a. Add 50 µL of stop solution to each
well to terminate the reaction. b. Measure the absorbance
immediately at 450 nm with a reference range of 620-650
nm using the microplate reader.
5. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
• Calculate the mean absorbance for each set of duplicate
standards, controls, and patient samples.
• Construct a standard curve by plotting the mean absorbance of
each standard on the y-axis versus the IgE concentration on the
x-axis.
• Determine the IgE concentration of the samples from the standard
curve. Ensure to multiply the result by the dilution factor.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform quality control with each assay run. Both negative and
positive controls must fall within the expected range to validate
the run.
• Document batch numbers, expiration dates of the kits, and
controls.
• Run blanks and ensure low background absorbance values are
achieved.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
Refer to site-specific reporting guidelines to document and
communicate results. Include all relevant patient information, assay
date, and tester’s initials in the final report.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Interpretation of specific IgE levels to ARTICHOKE (CYNARA
SCOLYMUS) should reference the clinical thresholds and
categories (e.g. 0-0.34 kU/L as negative, 0.35-0.69 kU/L as low
positive, etc.).
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the ELISA Kit insert for limitations. Consider possibilities of
cross-reactivity and ensure rigorous quality control.
