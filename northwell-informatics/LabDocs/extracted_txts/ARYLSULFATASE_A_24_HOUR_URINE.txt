Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Title: Analytical Phase
Procedure for Arylsulfatase A, 24 Hour, Urine
1. PURPOSE: This SOP provides a detailed step-by-step
procedure for the analytical phase of generating results for
Arylsulfatase A (ASA) in 24-hour urine samples. This includes
sample preparation, analysis, quality control, and result
reporting to ensure reliable and accurate measurements.
2. SCOPE: This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel
engaged in the analysis of Arylsulfatase A in 24-hour urine
samples at our CLIA-certified laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY: It is the responsibility of trained laboratory
personnel to perform the analysis of Arylsulfatase A in urine
samples according to this procedure. The Laboratory
Supervisor will ensure adherence to the SOP and take
corrective actions when deviations occur.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY:
• Specimen: 24-hour urine collection.
• Collection container: Plastic urine container, free of preservatives.
• Storage: Store the collected urine sample at 2-8°C during and
after the collection period until analysis.
• Stability: Samples should be analyzed within 72 hours of
collection.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES:
• Spectrophotometer or fluorometer
• Water bath or incubator (set at 37°C)
• Micropipettes and tips
• Centrifuge
• Arylsulfatase A assay kit, including:
◦ Enzyme substrate (e.g., p-nitrocatechol sulfate or 4-
methylumbelliferyl sulfate)
◦ Reaction buffer
◦ Standard solution (for calibration curve)
◦ Stop solution (if applicable)
• Calibrated pH meter
• Vortex mixer
• Laboratory glassware (e.g., test tubes, volumetric flasks)
• Timer
1. PROCEDURE:
A. Sample Preparation:
1. Mix the 24-hour urine collection thoroughly.
2. Measure and record the total volume of the 24-hour urine
sample.
3. Aliquot an appropriate volume (e.g., 10 mL) of the urine sample
for analysis and store the remaining sample back at 2-8°C if
return to storage is necessary.
B. Assay Setup:
1. Turn on the spectrophotometer/fluorometer and allow it to warm
up according to the manufacturer's instructions.
2. Prepare the reaction buffer as specified in the assay kit insert.
3. Prepare the enzyme substrate solution following the
instructions provided in the assay kit insert.
C. Calibration Curve:
1. Prepare a series of standard solutions of Arylsulfatase A (e.g.,
0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 U/L) using the standard solution
supplied in the assay kit.
2. Add the appropriate volume of each standard solution to a set
of labeled test tubes.
D. Enzyme Reaction:
1. For each urine sample, standard, and control, add an equal
volume of reaction buffer to the test tube.
2. Add the enzyme substrate solution to each test tube and mix
well using a vortex mixer.
3. Incubate the reaction mixture at 37°C for the specific period as
recommended by the kit manufacturer (e.g., 30-60 minutes).
E. Stopping the Reaction:
1. At the end of the incubation period, add the stop solution to
each test tube to terminate the reaction (if required by the
assay kit).
2. Mix well to ensure complete termination of the reaction.
F. Measurement:
1. Measure the absorbance or fluorescence of each reaction
mixture using the spectrophotometer/fluorometer at the
appropriate wavelength specified by the assay kit.
2. Record the results for each sample, standard, and control.
3. QUALITY CONTROL:
• Include quality control samples (low, medium, and high) in each
assay run to monitor the accuracy and precision of the analysis.
• Perform the analysis in duplicate or triplicate to ensure
reproducibility.
• Ensure that the calibration curve is linear and that the QC results
fall within the acceptable range specified by the kit insert.
1. REPORTING RESULTS:
• Calculate the concentration of Arylsulfatase A in each urine
sample using the calibration curve.
• Express the results in units per liter (U/L).
• Document the final results in the laboratory information system
(LIS) for review and validation by a technologist.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
• Refer to the assay kit insert for specific limitations related to the
enzyme substrate and buffer compatibility.
1. REFERENCES:
• Refer to the product insert provided with the Arylsulfatase A assay
kit for detailed instructions and technical guidance.
