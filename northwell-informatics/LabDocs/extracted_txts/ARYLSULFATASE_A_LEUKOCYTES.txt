Protocol for the Analytical Phase of Generating Results for
Arylsulfatase A (ASA) in Leukocytes
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this protocol is to outline the steps and procedures for
the analysis and generation of results for Arylsulfatase A (ASA)
enzyme activity in leukocytes. This test is typically used for the
diagnosis of metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD).
1. SCOPE
This protocol is applicable to all laboratory personnel involved in the
analytical phase of ASA testing in a CLIA-certified laboratory.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
• It is the responsibility of laboratory technologists to perform the
analysis according to this protocol.
• The supervisor is responsible for ensuring that all staff are trained
and competent in performing the procedure.
• All personnel must adhere to the safety and quality standards as
outlined in the laboratory's policy.
1. SPECIMEN
• Preferred Specimen: Fresh heparinized whole blood collected
and processed for leukocyte isolation.
• Storage and Stability: Isolated leukocytes should be processed
immediately. If immediate processing is not possible, leukocytes
can be stored at 4°C for up to 24 hours.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Centrifuge
• Reagent kits for ASA assay (commercially available)
• Microplate reader or spectrophotometer capable of measuring at
515 nm
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Leukocyte isolation medium
• Buffer solutions as specified in the assay kit
1. PROCEDURE
A. Leukocyte Isolation:
1. Collect blood in a heparinized tube and mix gently.
2. Centrifuge the blood at 500xg for 10 minutes at room
temperature.
3. Remove the plasma and buffy coat layer containing the
leukocytes.
4. Wash leukocytes twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS),
centrifuging at 300xg for 5 minutes after each wash.
5. Resuspend the final leukocyte pellet in a minimal volume of the
appropriate assay buffer.
B. Enzyme Assay:
1. Prepare reaction mixture as specified in the assay kit.
2. Add specified volume of leukocyte suspension to the reaction
mixture.
3. Incubate the reaction mixture at 37°C for the time duration
specified in the assay kit.
4. Stop the reaction by adding the stopping reagent (provided in
the kit).
5. Measure absorbance at 515 nm using a microplate reader or
spectrophotometer.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform quality control measures as per the manufacturer's
guidelines.
• Use known ASA activity controls (high, low, and blank) with each
batch of tests to ensure assay accuracy.
• Document all control results and evaluate them against the
established acceptable ranges before reporting patient results.
1. CALCULATION AND INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
• Calculate the enzyme activity by comparing the absorbance
readings of the test samples against the standard curve
generated from the controls.
• Report results in units of enzyme activity (e.g., nmol/mg protein/
hr).
• Reference values for ASA activity should be provided in the test
report and used to interpret patient results.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Enter the final ASA activity results into the laboratory information
system (LIS).
• Review and verify results following laboratory protocols before
releasing them to the referring physician or clinician.
• Document any discrepancies, inconsistent results, or instrument
messages that may need further action or troubleshooting.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If any QC fails, do not release patient results and repeat the
assay with new controls.
• If persistent QC failure occurs, notify the supervisor immediately
and consult the assay manufacturer's troubleshooting guide.
• Document all troubleshooting steps and corrective actions taken.
1. SAFETY AND DISPOSAL
• Follow standard laboratory safety guidelines, including the use of
personal protective equipment (PPE) during all steps of the
procedure.
• Dispose of all biological waste in accordance with the laboratory’s
biohazard disposal protocols.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions for the ASA assay kit.
• Relevant clinical biochemical textbooks and literature.
• Laboratory safety and quality control manuals.
This protocol must be reviewed periodically and updated in
accordance with changes in technology, safety standards, or
regulatory requirements.
