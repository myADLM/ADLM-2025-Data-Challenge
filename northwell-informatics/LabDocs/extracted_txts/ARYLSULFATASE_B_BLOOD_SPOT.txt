1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this protocol is to provide clear and standardized
procedures for the analytical phase of generating results for
Arylsulfatase B (ARSB) enzyme activity using blood spot samples.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all personnel involved in the analysis and
reporting of ARSB enzyme activity in blood spot samples in the
laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Laboratory Technologists: Responsible for performing the
analysis according to the procedure and ensuring accurate
documentation.
• Supervisors: Responsible for overseeing the process, reviewing
the results, and verifying the documentation.
• Quality Control Personnel: Responsible for ensuring all QC
measures are appropriately followed and documented.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Dried blood spot (DBS) on specified filter paper
• Collection Method: Blood spots collected via heel or finger prick
• Transport Conditions: Maintain at room temperature and avoid
exposure to high heat or moisture
• Acceptability: Spots must be adequately filled and uniformly
saturated
5. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Equipment:
◦ DBS Extraction System
◦ Centrifuge
◦ Incubator
◦ ARSB Assay Kit (provided by manufacturer)
◦ Spectrophotometer or fluorometer for detection
• Reagents:
◦ Buffer solution (as indicated by assay kit)
◦ Substrate solution specific for ARSB
◦ Control materials (positive and negative controls)
6. PROCEDURE
A) Sample Preparation
1. DBS Extraction:
◦ Cut out the DBS circle from the filter paper using sterile
scissors.
◦ Place the DBS sample in an extraction tube containing
appropriate volume of extraction buffer.
◦ Incubate the tube at room temperature or as specified by
the assay kit instructions.
2. Mixing:
◦ Vortex the extraction tube vigorously to ensure complete
elution of the blood spot.
◦ Centrifuge the tube at specified RPM for the specified
duration (as per kit manual) to pellet debris.
B) Enzyme Activity Assay
1. Enzyme Reaction:
◦ Aliquot the required volume of eluate into reaction wells
according to the protocol outlined in ARSB Assay Kit.
◦ Add the designated volume of substrate solution to each
well containing the eluate.
2. Incubation:
◦ Incubate the reaction wells at the temperature and time
specified in the assay kit instructions to allow enzyme-
substrate reaction.
3. Detection:
◦ Measure the enzyme activity using spectrophotometer or
fluorometer as per the assay kit specifications.
◦ Record optical density or fluorescence units.
C) Quality Control
1. Controls:
◦ Analyze positive and negative control samples alongside the
patient samples.
◦ Ensure control results fall within the acceptable range as
specified by manufacturer.
2. Calibration:
◦ Perform calibration of the detection equipment using
standard solutions provided with the assay kit.
D) Data Analysis and Reporting
1. Calculation:
◦ Calculate the ARSB enzyme activity for each sample based
on the absorbance or fluorescence readings and the
standard curve provided in the assay kit.
2. Result Documentation:
◦ Document all results in the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
◦ Verify and review data to ensure accuracy and precision.
3. Result Interpretation:
◦ Compare results with established reference ranges and
interpret accordingly.
◦ Flag any abnormal or critical values for immediate review.
E) Maintenance and Troubleshooting
1. Equipment Maintenance:
◦ Regularly clean and calibrate equipment according to
manufacturer guidelines.
◦ Document maintenance and servicing activities.
2. Troubleshooting:
◦ If unexpected results are obtained, check for equipment
issues, reagent integrity, and sample quality.
◦ Repeat analysis if necessary and document corrective
actions taken.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
Results must be accurately communicated to the appropriate
healthcare provider through the LIS. Critical values must be promptly
reported following laboratory protocols.
8. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• ARSB Enzyme Activity Reference Range: [Insert Reference
