Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Title: Analytical Phase Protocol
for Generating Results for Arylsulfatase B, Leukocytes
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the procedure for the analytical phase of
generating results for Arylsulfatase B (ARSB) activity in leukocytes.
This procedure ensures accurate, consistent, and reliable results for
ARSB activity, which is critical in diagnosing mucopolysaccharidosis
type VI (Maroteaux-Lamy syndrome).
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory personnel to
perform this procedure accurately, document all steps and results,
and report any issues to the supervisor. All staff must ensure that
quality control measures are followed, and instrument calibration is
maintained throughout the procedure.
1. DEFINITION
Arylsulfatase B (ARSB) is an enzyme responsible for the degradation
of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) in lysosomes. Deficiency in this
enzyme activity leads to mucopolysaccharidosis type VI (Maroteaux-
Lamy syndrome).
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred specimen type: EDTA whole blood.
• Volume: Minimum 5 mL.
• Stability: Specimen should be processed within 24 hours of
collection and must be kept at 4°C during transportation.
• Unacceptable specimens: Clotted, hemolyzed, or improperly
labeled specimens should be rejected.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Centrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Micropipettes and tips
• 96-well microtiter plates
• Fluorometric plate reader
• Arylsulfatase B substrate (4-methylumbelliferyl sulfate)
• Reaction buffer
• Stop solution (e.g., sodium carbonate)
• Leukocyte isolation reagents
• Quality control material with known ARSB activity
1. PROCEDURE
A. Leukocyte Isolation
1. Upon receiving the EDTA whole blood specimen, vortex gently
to mix.
2. Centrifuge at 300 x g for 10 minutes to separate the plasma
and leukocytes.
3. Carefully aspirate the plasma layer without disturbing the buffy
coat.
4. Collect the buffy coat and resuspend in a minimum volume of
cold PBS (phosphate-buffered saline).
5. Count leukocytes using an automated counter or
hemocytometer.
B. Enzyme Assay Setup
1. Prepare reaction buffer and ARSB substrate solution according
to manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Aliquot appropriate volumes of leukocyte suspension into a 96-
well microtiter plate.
3. Add reaction buffer and ARSB substrate solution to each well.
4. Include blank wells (leukocytes without substrate) and standard
wells (known ARSB activity) for calibration.
5. Incubate the plate at 37°C for 1 hour.
C. Reaction Termination
1. After incubation, add stop solution to each well to terminate the
reaction.
2. Gently tap the plate to mix.
D. Measurement and Data Analysis
1. Measure fluorescence intensity of each well using a
fluorometric plate reader with excitation and emission settings
appropriate for 4-methylumbelliferone.
2. Record the fluorescence readings.
3. Subtract blank readings from sample readings to obtain net
fluorescence values.
4. Use the standard curve to calculate ARSB activity in leukocytes
(typically expressed in nmol/h/mg protein).
E. Quality Control
1. Run quality control samples with each batch of tests to ensure
accuracy and precision.
2. Document all quality control results and take corrective action if
results fall outside acceptable ranges.
3. REPORTING RESULTS
4. Verify and review all calculated ARSB activity results.
5. Report results using the laboratory information system (LIS).
6. Flag and review any abnormal results per clinical guidelines,
consulting with a supervisor if necessary.
7. DOCUMENTATION
8. All data, including specimen details, reagent lot numbers, QC
results, and assay readings, must be documented in the
laboratory records.
9. Ensure all entries are accurate, legible, and complete.
10. REFERENCES
11. Manufacturer’s guidelines for Arylsulfatase B substrate and
reaction buffers.
12. Clinical guidelines for the diagnosis of mucopolysaccharidosis
type VI.
13. METHOD LIMITATIONS
14. Hemolyzed samples may interfere with enzyme activity
measurements.
15. Results may vary due to improper specimen handling or delays
in processing.
16. Ensure all reagents are within their expiration dates and stored
as recommended.
This protocol is subject to review and modification as necessary to
ensure accuracy and compliance with current standards and
regulations.
