STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP) ANALYTICAL
PHASE Protocol for Generating Results for Ascaris, IgE, Serum
1. PURPOSE
This procedure outlines the steps for performing and generating
results for Ascaris specific IgE in serum samples. The goal is to
ensure the accuracy, reliability, and reproducibility of the results.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for carrying out the
procedures as instructed, ensuring proper documentation, and
immediately reporting any issues or deviations to supervisors.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type: Serum
Specimen Collection:
• Blood should be collected using appropriate techniques into a
plain red-top tube or serum separator tube (SST).
• Allow the blood to clot at room temperature and then centrifuge to
separate the serum.
• Specimens must be free from hemolysis and lipemia.
• Specimens should be stored at 2-8°C if analysis will be performed
within 48 hours, or frozen at -20°C (or colder) if stored for longer
periods.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens that are hemolyzed, lipemic, or contaminated.
• Specimens not stored or transported under proper conditions.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• ELISA reader
• Automated Immunoassay Analyzer specific for IgE detection
• Incubators
• Reagents and calibrators specific for Ascaris IgE detection
• Microtiter plates for ELISA
• Controls (positive and negative)
• Micropipettes and tips
• Absorbent paper
• Distilled or deionized water
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation:
1. Ensure all equipment and reagents are calibrated and within
expiry dates.
2. Bring all reagents and samples to room temperature (18-25°C)
before use.
3. Prepare the required number of wells in the microtiter plate for
controls, standards, and patient samples.
B. Assay Procedure:
1. Label microtiter wells for standards, controls, and patient
samples.
2. Pipette the recommended volume of ready-to-use standards,
controls, and patient serum samples into designated wells.
3. Add the specified amount of conjugate to each well.
4. Incubate the microtiter plate at the specified temperature and
duration according to the kit insert.
5. Wash the wells to remove unbound antibodies using an
appropriate buffer solution. Perform the wash cycle as defined
by the kit instructions.
6. Add the appropriate substrate to each well. Incubate as
required.
7. Stop the reaction by adding stop solution to each well.
8. Read the optical density (OD) at the specified wavelength using
an ELISA reader within the time limit mentioned in the
instruction manual.
9. For assays performed on an automated analyzer, follow the
instrument-specific instructions for sample loading, reagent
addition, incubation, washing, and reading.
C. Quality Control:
1. Run positive and negative controls with each batch of samples.
2. Include internal quality controls and evaluate them against set
threshold criteria.
3. Any batch failing QC criteria must be investigated and repeated
if necessary.
D. Data Analysis and Result Reporting:
1. Construct a standard curve by plotting the OD of standards
versus the concentration. Use the curve to determine the
concentration of Ascaris specific IgE in patient samples.
2. Compare results against the reference intervals.
3. Record and verify results in the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
4. Any critical or abnormal results must be promptly
communicated to the requesting physician.
5. REPORTING RESULTS: Results must be documented and
transcribed accurately into the LIS, ensuring complete details such as
patient ID, assay date, and technologist identification.
6. REFERENCE INTERVALS:
• Ascaris IgE: Negative, Borderline, Positive (Refer to the
manufacturer-specific cutoff values supplied with the reagent kit).
7. TROUBLESHOOTING:
• If controls do not fall within the acceptable range, the run is
considered invalid. Review procedures, reagents, equipment, and
consult with a supervisor before repeating the assay.
• In cases of technical issues with automated analyzers, refer to the
instrument-specific troubleshooting guide.
8. MAINTENANCE AND STORAGE:
• Follow routine maintenance protocols for equipment.
• Store reagents as per manufacturer recommendations and
monitor expiry dates.
• Document all maintenance activities comprehensively.
9. HEALTH AND SAFETY:
• Adhere to laboratory biosafety guidelines.
• Use appropriate PPE.
• Dispose of biohazardous materials in designated containers.
10. RECORDS:
• Maintain records of all assay runs, including quality control data
and maintenance logs.
• Ensure traceability for auditing purposes.
REFERENCES:
• Manufacturer’s instructions for the specific IgE detection kit.
• CAP (College of American Pathologists) guidelines.
• Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA).
This SOP ensures that all steps in the analytical phase for detecting
Ascaris specific IgE in serum samples are followed meticulously,
ensuring the integrity and reliability of the results generated.
