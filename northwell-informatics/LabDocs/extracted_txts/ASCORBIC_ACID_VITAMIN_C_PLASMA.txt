Standard Operating Procedure: Analysis of Ascorbic
Acid (Vitamin C), Plasma
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to outline the steps for the accurate
and timely analysis of ascorbic acid (vitamin C) in plasma specimens
using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The aim is to
ensure reliable and reproducible results that aid in the diagnosis and
monitoring of vitamin C deficiency or excess.
2. DEFINITION
Ascorbic acid (Vitamin C) is a vital nutrient in human health, acting as
an antioxidant and playing a crucial role in various physiological
processes. Analyzing its concentration in plasma can provide
valuable information regarding an individual's nutritional and health
status.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of laboratory technologists and designated
personnel to carry out the analysis according to this SOP. The
Laboratory Manager or a designated supervisor is responsible for
compliance with this procedure and ensuring corrective actions are
taken when necessary.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Equipment:
◦ High-Performance Liquid Chromatograph (HPLC) with UV-Vis
detector
◦ Centrifuge
◦ Refrigerated microcentrifuge
◦ Pipettes and tips
◦ Vortex mixer
• Reagents:
◦ HPLC-grade solvents (such as methanol or acetonitrile)
◦ Ascorbic acid standard
◦ Mobile phase buffer (such as Metaphosphoric acid)
◦ Calibration standards and quality control materials
• Supplies:
◦ Plasma collection tubes
◦ Microcentrifuge tubes
◦ HPLC vials
◦ Filter membranes or cartridges (0.45 µm)
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND PREPARATION
• Preferred/acceptable specimens:
◦ Plasma collected in EDTA tubes
◦ Specimen should be kept on ice and processed within 2 hours
of collection.
• Unacceptable specimens:
◦ Hemolyzed samples
◦ Lipemic samples
◦ Specimens not processed in a timely manner (beyond 2 hours
without proper storage)
6. PROCEDURE
6.1. Specimen Preparation
1. Centrifugation:
◦ Centrifuge the EDTA tubes at 1,500 x g for 10 minutes at
4°C to separate the plasma.
◦ Carefully aliquot the plasma into microcentrifuge tubes
without disturbing the buffy coat layer.
2. Storage:
◦ If not analyzed immediately, store the plasma samples at
-70°C. Analyze within 48 hours if stored at 4°C.
6.2. Sample Extraction
1. Preparation of Extraction Reagent:
◦ Prepare a solution of 5% metaphosphoric acid.
2. Extraction:
◦ Pipette 500 µL of the plasma into a microcentrifuge tube.
◦ Add 500 µL of the metaphosphoric acid solution to the
plasma.
◦ Vortex the mixture for 1 minute.
◦ Centrifuge the mixture at 12,000 x g for 5 minutes at 4°C.
3. Filtration:
◦ Filter the supernatant using a 0.45 µm filter membrane into
an HPLC vial.
6.3. HPLC Analysis
1. HPLC System Setup:
◦ Set up the HPLC system with the appropriate column (e.g.,
C18 column).
◦ Prepare the mobile phase as per the specified composition
(e.g., a mixture of methanol and water with a ratio of 80:20).
2. Calibration and Quality Control:
◦ Calibrate the HPLC system using ascorbic acid calibration
standards.
◦ Run quality control samples to ensure the accuracy and
precision of the method.
3. Sample Injection and Analysis:
◦ Inject 20 µL of the filtered sample into the HPLC system.
◦ Set the detector wavelength at 254 nm for ascorbic acid
detection.
◦ Run the analysis according to the programmed method
parameters (e.g., flow rate of 1.0 mL/min, column
temperature at 25°C).
4. Data Analysis:
◦ Analyze the chromatograms obtained from the HPLC
system.
◦ Quantify the ascorbic acid concentration in the plasma
samples by comparing the peak areas to the calibration
standards.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform assay quality control with each batch of samples using
both low-level and high-level quality control materials.
• Validate the results by ensuring they fall within the defined
acceptable range.
• Document all QC results and any corrective actions taken.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Review and verify the results before reporting.
• Document any unusual findings or deviations encountered during
the analysis.
• Report the ascorbic acid concentration in plasma in mg/dL or
µmol/L as per the laboratory's reporting guidelines.
