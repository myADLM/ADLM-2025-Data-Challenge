Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for
Asparagus, IgE, Serum
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the steps necessary for the
analytical phase of testing asparagus-specific Immunoglobulin E
(IgE) in serum samples. This includes testing procedures, quality
control measures, result recording, and ensuring accurate and
reliable data.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the
analysis of asparagus-specific IgE in serum, ensuring proper quality
control, interpreting results, and recording and reporting findings. It is
the responsibility of all staff to follow the SOP strictly to maintain the
accuracy and reliability of test results.
3. PRINCIPLE AND/OR PURPOSE
Asparagus-specific IgE measurement in serum is a diagnostic test
used to identify allergic sensitization to asparagus.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen Type:
• Serum
Specimen Collection:
• Blood should be collected in a plain tube (red-top or serum-
separator tube) and allowed to clot at room temperature.
• After clotting, centrifuge the tube at 3000 RPM for 10 minutes to
separate the serum.
Specimen Stability:
• Store serum at 2-8°C if analyzed within 48 hours.
• For longer storage, serum should be frozen at -20°C to -70°C.
• Avoid multiple freeze-thaw cycles to prevent degradation of IgE.
Specimen Unacceptability:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
• Tubes containing anticoagulants.
• Samples that have undergone multiple freeze-thaw cycles.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• ELISA or ImmunoCAP analyzer
• Pipettes and tips (calibrated)
• Standard laboratory glassware
• Controls (positive and negative)
• Calibrators
• Assay buffer
• Washing solutions
• Substrate solutions
• Stop solution
• Serum storage tubes
6. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Reagent Preparation: Prepare all reagents, controls, and
calibrators according to manufacturer's instructions. Bring all
reagents to room temperature before use.
2. Sample Preparation: Aliquot serum samples into appropriately
labeled tubes.
3. Calibration: Ensure that the analyzer is calibrated using
appropriate calibrators, according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
Assay Procedure:
1. Sample Addition:
◦ Pipette a specified volume (as per kit instructions) of
calibrators, controls, and serum samples into the designated
wells of the test plate.
2. Incubation:
◦ Incubate the plate at the recommended conditions (time,
temperature) as specified by the manufacturer.
3. Washing:
◦ Wash the plate as directed to remove unbound substances.
4. Detection:
◦ Add detection antibodies or substrates as directed in the
manufacturer's protocol.
5. Second Incubation:
◦ Incubate the plate again to allow the reaction to take place.
6. Substrate Addition:
◦ Add substrate solution and allow color development.
7. Stopping the Reaction:
◦ Add stop solution to each well to halt the reaction.
8. Reading:
◦ Read the absorbance or fluorescence (depending on the
method) using an appropriate plate reader at the specified
wavelength.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Internal Quality Control:
◦ Run a set of positive and negative controls with each assay
to validate the run's accuracy and precision.
◦ Controls should fall within the manufacturer-specified
ranges. If controls fail, repeat the assay.
2. Recording Quality Control:
◦ Document all control results and any corrective actions
taken for out-of-range controls in the laboratory quality
control log.
3. Verification and Validation:
◦ Use a batch of control samples previously tested to verify
that new lots of reagents are performing up to specifications.
8. RESULT INTERPRETATION AND REPORTING
Result Calculation:
• The concentration of asparagus-specific IgE in each sample is
calculated using the calibration curve generated in the assay.
Reference Range:
• Refer to the kit insert or manufacturer guidelines for the reference
ranges. Values outside the reference range should be flagged.
Reporting:
• Report results through the laboratory information system (LIS)
ensuring a review by the supervising technologist.
• Record any critical values and notify the relevant healthcare
provider as per laboratory protocol. Ensure documentation of
communications.
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• The assay can be influenced by cross-reactivity to other
allergens. Follow guidelines in the specific kit insert regarding
known cross-reactivities.
• Ensure all personnel are trained in recognizing and
troubleshooting common errors and limitations related to the
assay.
