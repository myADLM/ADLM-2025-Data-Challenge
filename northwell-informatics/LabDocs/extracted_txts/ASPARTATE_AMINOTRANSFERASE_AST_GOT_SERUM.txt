Protocol for the Analytical Phase of Generating Results for
Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST) (GOT), Serum
1. PURPOSE
To ensure accurate, reliable, and timely measurement of Aspartate
Aminotransferase (AST) in serum specimens utilizing standardized
laboratory methods and quality control procedures.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory personnel, including medical laboratory
scientists and technicians, are responsible for performing and
documenting the steps outlined in this procedure. The laboratory
supervisor is responsible for overseeing adherence to the protocol
and addressing any issues that may arise.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/acceptable specimen:
• Serum obtained from a blood sample collected in a standard red-
top tube or serum separator tube (SST).
• The specimen should be centrifuged, and the serum promptly
separated from the cells within 2 hours of collection to avoid
hemolysis and ensure stability of AST.
Unacceptable specimens:
• Serum showing hemolysis, as it can elevate AST levels.
• Specimens that have not been properly labeled with patient
identification details.
• Specimens that have not been separated within the required time
frame.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Automated chemistry analyzer
• ASTM reagent kits validated for use with the specific analyzer
• Quality control materials (commercially available, bi-level control
solutions)
• Calibrators specific to the AST assay
• Disposable pipettes
• Centrifuge
• Red-top tubes or SST
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
5. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Ensure all equipment is properly maintained and calibrated as
per manufacturer guidelines.
2. Prepare the reagent and quality control materials as specified
by the manufacturer. Ensure reagents are at the appropriate
temperature and have not exceeded their expiration date.
Sample Analysis:
1. Verify patient information and ensure the sample is
appropriately labeled.
2. Inspect the serum sample for hemolysis, lipemia, or icterus. If
the sample is hemolyzed, request a new sample as it can affect
AST levels.
3. Load the patient serum sample into the automated chemistry
analyzer according to the manufacturer's instructions.
4. Load calibrators, quality control materials, and any required
reagents into the analyzer.
5. Initiate the analyzer and enter the workloads, including patient
serum samples, calibrators, and controls.
Quality Control:
1. Run quality control materials at the beginning of each shift, after
any maintenance, or as required by the laboratory's quality
control plan.
2. Review control results to ensure they are within acceptable
ranges before proceeding with patient sample analysis.
3. If control results are outside acceptable ranges, troubleshoot
according to the manufacturer's instructions and do not report
patient results until acceptable control results are obtained.
Result Calculation:
1. The analyzer will automatically calculate AST results for each
patient sample based on the absorbance readings and
calibration curve.
2. Verify that the analyzer has completed the analysis and that
results are within the reportable range.
Reporting Results:
1. Review results for any flagged values or results showing
significant deviation.
2. Enter/verify results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
3. Evaluate any critical values according to the laboratory's policy.
Confirm and report any critical values immediately to the
attending physician or the designated healthcare provider.
4. Print and file results as required, ensuring results are
communicated promptly to the physicians for diagnostic and
management decisions.
6. QUALITY CONTROL AND MAINTENANCE
Daily:
• Check and record temperatures of refrigerators, freezers, and
incubators.
• Perform instrument maintenance and calibration as per
manufacturer’s instructions.
• Run daily quality control and ensure results meet established
criteria.
Weekly/Monthly:
• Review ongoing quality control charts to detect any trends or
shifts.
• Perform proficiency testing as required by regulatory agencies
and document accordingly.

3. Manufacturer's instructions and calibration documentation
8. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If quality control results are out of range, recalibrate the analyzer
and rerun the controls.
• If there is a persistent issue, contact the analyzer's technical
support for assistance.
• Do not release patient results until the problem is resolved and
results are verified to be accurate.
By adhering to this protocol, laboratory personnel can ensure the
accurate, reliable, and timely generation of Aspartate
Aminotransferase (AST) results, facilitating effective patient care.
