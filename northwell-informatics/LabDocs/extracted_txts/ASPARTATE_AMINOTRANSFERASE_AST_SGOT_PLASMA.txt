Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Aspartate Aminotransferase
(AST/SGOT) Assay in Plasma
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the quantitative analysis of
Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST/SGOT) in plasma specimens to
ensure accurate and reproducible results.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory staff are responsible for
performing the AST/SGOT assay according to this SOP. The
laboratory supervisor will oversee the process to ensure compliance
with the SOP and resolve any issues that may arise during testing.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/acceptable:
• Plasma collected in lithium heparin, sodium heparin, or EDTA
tubes.
• Specimens should be centrifuged and plasma separated within 2
hours of collection.
• Store plasma at 2-8°C if analysis is not performed immediately
(up to 48 hours). For longer storage, freeze at -20°C or below.
Unacceptable:
• Hemolyzed specimens as hemolysis can significantly interfere
with AST activity.
• Specimens collected in tubes with anticoagulants other than
heparin or EDTA.
• Specimens that have not been properly labeled or lack collection
date and time.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Automated chemistry analyzer (e.g., Roche Cobas, Siemens
ADVIA)
• AST reagent kit (specific to the analyzer being used)
• Calibrators and controls (provided by the manufacturer)
• Pipettes and tips
• Centrifuge
• Plasma separation tubes
• Quality Control materials (bilevel controls)
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation
1. Verify that the analyzer is properly calibrated and all
maintenance has been performed according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
2. Allow reagents, calibrators, and controls to reach room
temperature before use.
B. Calibration
1. Perform a calibration using the provided calibrator material
according to the analyzer's specific protocol.
2. Ensure that calibration is within the acceptable range before
proceeding with sample analysis.
C. Quality Control
1. Run quality control materials at both high and low levels as
specified by the laboratory's quality control schedule.
2. Verify that QC results are within the acceptable range. If QC
fails, troubleshoot and resolve before proceeding with patient
samples.
D. Sample Analysis
1. Identify and prepare patient samples by ensuring they are
properly labeled and have been centrifuged to separate
plasma.
2. Load patient samples, calibrators, and controls onto the
analyzer according to the manufacturer's instructions.
3. Select the AST assay on the analyzer and initiate the run.
4. The analyzer will automatically perform the analysis and
generate results for each sample.
E. Post-Analysis Handling
1. Review result printouts or electronic data for any flags or error
messages.
2. Reanalyze any flagged or out-of-range results to confirm
accuracy.
3. Document and take appropriate action if there are any
discrepancies in results.
4. REPORTING RESULTS
5. Results are automatically transmitted to the Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
6. Verify and review results in the LIS before releasing to the
clinician.
7. Report any critical values according to the laboratory’s critical
result policy and document the notification of the healthcare
provider.
8. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Normal reference ranges for AST/SGOT will vary depending on
the analyzer and reagent kit in use. Refer to the manufacturer’s
guidelines or specific laboratory established reference intervals.
1. QUALITY CONTROL AND LIMITATIONS
• Quality control must be performed daily and with each batch of
tests.
• Any deviations from expected QC ranges must be investigated
and resolved.
• Hemolysis, lipemia, or icterus in samples can interfere with the
AST assay and should be noted for all reported results.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's reagent kit insert for AST/SGOT.
• Analyzer user manual.
• Laboratory quality control and maintenance logs.
1. DOCUMENTATION
• Record daily calibration and quality control results.
• Document any troubleshooting actions and corrective measures
taken.
• Maintain logs of specimen receipt, processing, and analysis.
Note: This protocol is subject to periodic review and updates to
ensure compliance with regulatory standards and advancements in
assay technology. Laboratory staff should refer to the latest version of
the SOP and relevant manufacturer's instructions.
