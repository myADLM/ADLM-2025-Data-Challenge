Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Generating Results for
ASPEN (POPULUS TREMULOIDES) IGE
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for the generation of results for Aspen
(Populus tremuloides) Immunoglobulin E (IgE) using a specific assay
kit in the laboratory.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel trained in
immunoassay techniques and is intended for use when testing
samples for the presence of Aspen (Populus tremuloides) specific
IgE.
3. RESPONSIBILITIES
• Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for following this
procedure to ensure accurate and reliable results.
• Laboratory supervisors are responsible for ensuring personnel are
trained and compliant with this SOP.
• Quality assurance staff must verify and maintain records of assay
performance and results.
4. DEFINITION
Aspen (Populus tremuloides) IgE: An immunoglobulin E antibody
specific to allergens from the aspen tree.
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Serum is the preferred specimen type.
• Sample volume: At least 1 mL of serum is required.
• If the serum sample is not tested immediately, it should be stored
at 2-8°C for no longer than 48 hours, or at -20°C or lower for long-
term storage.
6. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Specific Aspen (Populus tremuloides) IgE enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit
• Adjustable pipettes and tips
• Vortex mixer
• Centrifuge
• Microplate reader (capable of reading at the specified wavelength
as per kit instructions)
• Incubator (37°C)
• Deionized or distilled water
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
7. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation:
1. Allow all reagents, samples, and controls to reach room
temperature before use.
2. Gently mix all reagents and samples by inverting several times
or vortexing, avoiding foam formation.
3. Label all sample and control wells on the microplate according
to the specified layout in the kit insert.
B) Assay Procedure:
1. Sample Addition: a. Add the specified volume of calibrators,
controls, and patient samples to the appropriate wells as per kit
instructions.
2. Incubation: a. Incubate the plate for the specified duration at
37°C as per the kit protocol.
3. Washing: a. Wash the plate using the wash buffer provided, as
per the number of washing cycles specified in the kit
instructions.
4. Detection: a. Add the detection antibody to each well and
incubate for the specified time at room temperature.
5. Substrate Addition: a. Add the substrate solution to each well
and allow color development for the specified time in the dark.
6. Stop Reaction: a. Add the stop solution to each well to halt the
enzymatic reaction, ensuring color change is complete.
C) Reading the Results:
1. Read the Microplate: a. Read the absorbance of each well at
the specified wavelength using a microplate reader. b. Ensure
all data is transferred accurately to the appropriate software for
analysis.
2. Calculations: a. Plot a standard curve using the absorbance
values of the calibrators. b. Determine the Aspen (Populus
tremuloides) IgE concentration in patient samples by
interpolating their absorbance values against the standard
curve.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Perform quality control for each run using the provided controls.
2. Ensure controls fall within the acceptable range specified by the
manufacturer.
3. Document any deviations and take corrective actions as
needed.
9. RESULT INTERPRETATION AND REPORTING
1. Verify all results, ensuring no technical errors occurred during
the testing process.
2. Report results in kU/L, according to the standardized reference
intervals provided in the kit.
3. Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS) and
securely store all data.
10. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the manufacturer’s kit insert for specific limitations and
potential interference factors affecting the assay.
