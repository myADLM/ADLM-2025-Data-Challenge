Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Analytical Phase for
Aspergillus Antibodies, Quantitative, DID
1. PURPOSE
This SOP guides the quantitative determination of Aspergillus
antibodies in patient serum samples using the Double
Immunodiffusion (DID) method. The procedure provides the steps
required from the preparation of samples to the generation of
accurate and reliable results.
Responsibility:
All laboratory personnel performing Aspergillus antibodies testing
must follow this SOP and ensure the accuracy and reliability of the
results.
1. DEFINITION
Aspergillus Antibodies: Immunoglobulins produced by the immune
system in response to Aspergillus species infection.
Quantitative DID Test: A laboratory technique used to quantify the
concentration of Aspergillus-specific antibodies in serum samples
through the formation and measurement of precipitin lines in the
agar.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type:
• Serum
Acceptable Specimen:
• At least 2 mL of serum collected in a serum separator tube (SST)
is required.
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Grossly hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
• Specimens with contaminants or collected in inappropriate
containers.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Laboratory incubator
• Lightbox for interpreting results
• Pipette and pipette tips
• Balance for agar preparation
Reagents:
• Agarose (for agar preparation)
• Buffer solution (e.g., PBS)
• Aspergillus antigen solution
• Positive and negative controls
• Distilled water
Supplies:
• DID plates
• Microtubes
• Applicator sticks or glass slides
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation of Agar Plates:
1. Prepare agarose solution (1% agarose in PBS).
2. Pour the agarose solution into plates and allow it to solidify.
3. Punch wells in the agarose using a template, maintaining a
specified distance between wells.
B. Serum and Control Preparation:
1. Thaw serum samples, positive and negative controls to room
temperature.
2. Pipette 50 µL of each serum sample and control into
corresponding wells on the agarose plate.
C. Adding Aspergillus Antigen Solution:
1. Pipette 50 µL Aspergillus antigen reagent into the central well
for each sample set.
D. Incubation:
1. Place the agar plates in an incubator at 37°C for 48 - 72 hours.
2. Periodically check for the formation of precipitin lines.
E. Interpretation and Quantification:
1. Examine the plates under a lightbox.
2. Measure the lines of precipitation formed between the antigen
and antibodies.
3. Compare the results against the positive control to quantify the
antibody concentration in the patient serum samples.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
A. Positive and Negative Controls:
1. Include positive and negative controls in each run to validate
the assay.
2. Ensure the controls produce expected results before accepting
any patient results.
B. Calibration:
1. Calibrate all equipment regularly as per the manufacturer’s
instructions.
2. Maintain a log of calibration dates and outcomes.
3. REPORTING RESULTS
4. Record quantitative results in the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
5. Report antibody concentration in IU/mL.
6. Notify the physician or clinical team if the results fall within a
critical range.
7. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• The reference range will be determined by the laboratory and
should be based on clinical correlation and validation studies.
• Notify the attending physician if the antibody levels exceed the
reference threshold indicating potential Aspergillosis.
1. LIMITATIONS
• Hemolyzed or lipemic samples may affect test results.
• Interference of rheumatoid factors or non-specific antibodies may
yield false-positive or false-negative results.

This protocol should be reviewed and updated annually or as needed
to reflect changes in laboratory practices or standards.
