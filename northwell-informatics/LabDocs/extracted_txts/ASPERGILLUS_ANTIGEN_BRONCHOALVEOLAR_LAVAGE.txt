Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for ASPERGILLUS
ANTIGEN, BRONCHOALVEOLAR LAVAGE (BAL)
1. PURPOSE
To provide standardized procedures for the analytical phase of
identifying Aspergillus antigen in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL)
samples, promoting accurate and reproducible results.
Responsibility: Designated staff are responsible for performing the
analytical testing, ensuring quality control, and maintaining
documentation according to this SOP.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred Specimen:
Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid collected in a sterile container.
• Specimen Volume:
Minimum volume required is 1 mL of BAL fluid.
• Specimen Storage:
BAL fluid should be kept at 2-8°C if analysis is to be conducted
within 72 hours. For delayed analysis, store the specimen at
-20°C or lower and avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens received with significant contamination.
• Specimens that are improperly labeled.
• Specimens that are too old (beyond established storage times).
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Equipment:
◦ Laminar flow hood (to reduce contamination risk)
◦ Microcentrifuge
◦ Incubator set at 37°C
◦ ELISA plate reader or similar immunoassay reader
• Reagents:
◦ Aspergillus antigen detection kit (follow manufacturer
instructions)
◦ Positive and negative controls specific to Aspergillus antigen
1. PROCEDURE
2. Preparation:
◦ Ensure that all reagents, controls, and equipment are
prepared and within their expiration date.
◦ Bring all reagents and standards to room temperature
before use.
3. Assay Procedure:
◦ Sample Handling:
▪ Thoroughly mix the BAL sample by gently inverting.
▪ Pipette the recommended volume of BAL fluid (as
specified by the antigen detection kit) into the
appropriate wells of the assay plate.
◦ Addition of Reagents:
▪ Add the appropriate volume of conjugate, substrate, and
other reagents as per the manufacturer’s instructions.
▪ Include positive and negative controls provided in the kit
in separate designated wells.
◦ Incubation:
▪ Incubate the plate at the specified temperature and time
as instructed by the manufacturer (usually 37°C for a
certain duration).
◦ Detection:
▪ Add the stop solution to terminate the reaction after the
specified incubation.
▪ Read the plate using an ELISA reader set to the
recommended wavelength (frequently 450 nm).
4. Quality Control:
◦ Run positive and negative controls with each batch of
samples to ensure the assay's integrity.
◦ Verify that control results fall within the acceptable range
defined by the kit manufacturer.
5. Interpretation of Results:
◦ Record absorbance values and compare against the cut-off
values provided by the kit insert.
◦ Report as positive or negative for Aspergillus antigen. If the
absorbance of the sample exceeds the positive control, it
should be flagged as positive. If within the range of the
negative control, it should be flagged as negative.
6. Documentation:
◦ Document all results, including absorbance values and
interpretation, in the laboratory information system (LIS).
◦ Ensure adherence to documentation protocols, including
time, date, and technologist initials.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
• Review and verify all results prior to submission.
• Negative results should be reported as “Aspergillus antigen not
detected.”
• Positive results should be reported as “Aspergillus antigen
detected.”
• Inconclusive or invalid results should include a comment
describing the issue and recommendations for repeat testing.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Refer to the manufacturer’s guidelines for cut-off values and
interpretive criteria.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Ensure all controls are within the manufacturer-defined
acceptable range for validity.
• Perform calibration as required and maintain calibration records.
• Document all QC checks and any corrective actions taken.
1. RESULT VALIDATION AND TROUBLESHOOTING
2. Result Validation:
◦ Cross-check control results for validity.
◦ Verify any unexpected results by reviewing specimen
integrity and preparation procedures.
3. Troubleshooting:
◦ If control values fall outside the acceptable range, repeat the
assay.
◦ For high background noise or unusual plate-reader errors,
ensure plate washing was adequate and reader settings are
correct.
◦ Consult the manufacturer's troubleshooting guide as
necessary.
