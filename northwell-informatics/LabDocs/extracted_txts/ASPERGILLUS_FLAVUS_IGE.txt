Standard Operating Procedure for Generating Aspergillus
Flavus IgE Results
1. PURPOSE This protocol outlines the procedure for the
analytical phase of generating results for Aspergillus flavus-
specific Immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies using automated
immunoassay instruments, ensuring accuracy and consistency.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
◦ Qualified laboratory technologists are responsible for
performing the assay, documenting the procedure, and
reviewing the results.
◦ It is the responsibility of laboratory supervisors to ensure
proper training of technologists for conducting Aspergillus
flavus IgE assays and guaranteeing adherence to this SOP.
3. DEFINITION Aspergillus flavus-specific IgE is an immunological
marker tested in serum to assess the presence of IgE
antibodies directed against Aspergillus flavus, indicating an
allergic response to this fungus.
4. EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS
◦ Automated immunoassay analyzer (e.g., ImmunoCAP,
ELISA system)
◦ Calibrators and controls (as specified by the assay
manufacturer)
◦ Specimen: Serum collected in appropriate tubes (e.g., SST
or red top), properly centrifuged and aliquoted
◦ Reagents and consumables supplied by the assay
manufacturer
◦ Traceable thermometer for verifying incubation temperature
5. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation and Calibration
• Ensure that the immunoassay analyzer is calibrated according to
the manufacturer's instructions.
• Verify the calibration status and document the calibration in the
logbook.
• Confirm that the assay reagents are within their expiry dates and
have been stored appropriately.
• Set up the instrument with necessary calibrators and controls.
B) Specimen Handling
• Acceptable specimens: Serum collected and processed as per
clinical guidelines. Preferred/acceptable: Serum separated and
tested within 48 hours of collection.
• Unacceptable specimens: Hemolyzed, lipemic, or improperly
stored samples. Rejected specimens must be documented.
• Allow specimens to reach room temperature before analysis.
C) Assay Procedure
• Load the serum specimens, calibrators, and controls onto the
analyzer.
• Perform the Aspergillus flavus IgE immunoassay as per the
manufacturer’s detailed instructions (refer to the package insert
for specific steps).
• Monitor the assay run, ensuring the temperature and other
conditions remain within specified ranges.
• Document the following for each run:
◦ Date and time
◦ Instrument ID
◦ Reagent lot numbers
◦ Technician initials
D) Quality Control
• Run quality control materials at least twice per day: Negative, low,
and high positive controls
• Record control results and verify they are within acceptable limits.
• If QC results are outside limits, troubleshoot as per instrument
manual or consult supervisor. Document actions taken.
E) Results Interpretation
• Review analyzer output and confirm all controls are within
acceptable ranges.
• Identify and flag any results outside of the established reference
range for Aspergillus flavus IgE.
• Document flagged results and any necessary follow-up tests or
actions in the LIS.
F) Documentation and Reporting
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Verify results in LIS ensuring all patient identifying information is
accurate.
• Provide results to the requesting clinician, ensuring critical values
are communicated urgently as per lab policy.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
◦ Established reference range for Aspergillus flavus IgE as
provided within the assay documentation must be adhered
to.
2. QUALITY CONTROL REQUIREMENTS
◦ Use commercial quality control materials that mimic patient
samples.
◦ Follow internal and external QC procedures regularly to
ensure assay performance.
3. LIMITATIONS
◦ Refer to the assay manufacturer’s insert for detailed
limitations affecting the accuracy and precision of
Aspergillus flavus IgE results.
4. TROUBLESHOOTING
◦ Follow manufacturer's guidelines for troubleshooting
instrument and assay errors.
◦ In case of persistent issues, obtain guidance from the
supervisor and consult with the service technician if needed.
5. REFERENCES
◦ Manufacturer's package insert and product documentation
for Aspergillus flavus IgE immunoassay.
Note: Always adhere to institutional policies and protocols in
conjunction with manufacturer guidelines.
