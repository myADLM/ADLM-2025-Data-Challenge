Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Aspergillus fumigatus Specific IgE, Serum
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the step-by-step procedure for
the analysis of Aspergillus fumigatus IgE in serum samples. This
SOP ensures consistent, high-quality and reliable results for clinical
diagnosis.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing the
analysis, ensuring all instruments are functioning correctly, monitoring
quality control measures, and accurately documenting results. It is
the responsibility of the laboratory supervisor to verify and review all
results and ensure compliance with this SOP.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred/acceptable:
◦ 2-3 mL of serum obtained from a properly drawn blood sample
using standard venipuncture technique.
◦ Serum should be separated from cells within 2 hours of
collection.
◦ Samples should be stored at 2-8°C if analysis is to be
performed within 48 hours.
◦ For longer storage periods, serum should be frozen at -20°C
or lower.
• Unacceptable:
◦ Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
◦ Samples not properly labeled.
◦ Samples that have been stored at room temperature for more
than 8 hours.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• ELISA plate reader (or automated immunoassay analyzer)
• Aspergillus fumigatus IgE specific ELISA kit or equivalent
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Microcentrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Automated washer (optional)
• Calibrators, controls, and reagents specific to the kit being used
• Distilled or deionized water
• Laboratory timer
• Laboratory-approved quality control documentation sheets/logs
1. PROCEDURE
5.1 Preparation
• Ensure all reagents are at room temperature before use.
• Prepare work area and ensure all necessary equipment is
available and in good working condition.
• Verify the expiration date of the ELISA kit and reagents. Do not
use expired materials.
• Perform instrument calibration and maintenance as per
manufacturer's recommendations.
5.2 Assay Procedure
• Carefully follow the manufacturer's instructions provided with the
Aspergillus fumigatus IgE specific ELISA kit or automated
immunoassay system:
1. Pipette required volume of calibrators, controls, and patient
serum samples into appropriate wells.
2. Add the appropriate enzyme conjugate to each well.
3. Incubate plates at the specified temperature and duration as
per kit instructions.
4. Wash wells using a microplate washer or manually as
outlined in the kit instructions.
5. Add the substrate solution, incubate, and then add the stop
solution after the specified time.
6. Measure the absorbance at the specified wavelength using
a microplate reader.
5.3 Quality Control
• Include internal and external quality controls in each run to ensure
assay accuracy and reliability.
• Calibrators and controls should yield results within the specified
range provided by the kit manufacturer.
• Document any deviation from expected controls and recalibrate or
repeat the assay as needed.
5.4 Interpretation of Results
• Software linked to the ELISA reader or automated analyzer will
calculate the concentration of Aspergillus fumigatus IgE in patient
serum samples.
• Reference intervals and unit of measurements should be obtained
from the kit instructions or validated through in-house data:
◦ Negative: < 0.35 kU/L
◦ Borderline: 0.35 - 0.70 kU/L
◦ Positive: > 0.70 kU/L
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results must be electronically transmitted to the Laboratory
Information System (LIS) and reviewed by the technologist.
• Results will then be validated and interpreted in the context of the
individual clinical picture.
• Any critical results or unexpected findings should be brought to
the attention of the responsible clinician promptly.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If calibration or controls fall outside of acceptable ranges:
◦ Verify procedure adherence, reagent integrity, and equipment
functionality.
◦ Troubleshoot as per kit manufacturer's recommendations.
◦ Document and take corrective actions. Reanalyze samples as
necessary.
• Maintain a log of all issues and resolutions for future reference.
