Analytical Phase Protocol for Aspergillus fumigatus IgG
Antibodies, Serum
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for the analysis of Aspergillus fumigatus IgG
antibodies in serum samples to ensure accurate and reliable results.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory staff trained to perform
Aspergillus fumigatus IgG antibody testing using the specified assay
method for patient serum samples.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
Laboratory staff must ensure that all steps of the procedure are
followed accurately to guarantee the reliability of test results.
Supervisors are responsible for ensuring that personnel conducting
the analysis are properly trained and that quality control is
maintained.
4. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
Equipment:
• Automated immunoassay analyzer (e.g., ELISA reader,
chemiluminescent immunoassay system, or other equipment as
per laboratory standards)
• Incubator (if required by the assay)
• Micropipettes and tips
• Centrifuge
Reagents:
• Aspergillus fumigatus IgG antibody assay kit
• Calibrators and controls provided with the assay kit
• Quality control materials (positive and negative controls)
• Deionized water (if necessary)
• Disposable test tubes and racks
5. SPECIMEN
Preferred Specimen:
• 5-10 mL of serum collected in a red or gold-top tube (serum
separator tube).
Specimen Handling and Storage:
• Allow the blood to clot at room temperature and centrifuge within
2 hours of collection.
• Separate the serum from the clot and transfer it to a labeled
transport tube.
• Store at 2-8°C if testing will occur within 48 hours; otherwise,
freeze at -20°C or lower.
6. PROCEDURE
Pre-Analytical Phase:
1. Ensure the serum specimen has been properly collected,
labeled, and stored.
2. If the specimen has been frozen, allow it to thaw completely
and mix gently before analysis.
Analytical Phase:
1. Preparation:
◦ Turn on the immunoassay analyzer and allow it to stabilize.
◦ Prepare reagents, calibrators, and controls according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Calibration:
◦ Perform calibration of the analyzer using the provided
calibrators.
◦ Verify that the calibration curve meets the manufacturer’s
criteria for linearity and precision.
3. Quality Control:
◦ Run positive and negative controls to ensure the system is
performing within established parameters.
◦ Record and analyze QC results. If QC results are out of
range, troubleshoot and resolve issues before proceeding
with patient samples.
4. Testing:
◦ Load the prepared serum samples, along with appropriately
labeled calibrators and controls, into the analyzer.
◦ Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for operating the
assay.
◦ Ensure that the incubator, washing, and detection steps are
performed according to the assay protocol.
5. Result Interpretation:
◦ Upon completion of the assay, review the generated results.
◦ Compare the patient sample results to the calibration curve
to determine antibody levels.
◦ Validate the results considering the QC outcomes.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Verification:
◦ Cross-check patient results with QC and calibration data.
◦ Ensure that results are consistent and within the dynamic
range of the assay.
◦ If results require confirmation, repeat the assay or verify
using an alternate method.
2. Documentation:
◦ Document all calibration, QC, and patient sample results in
the laboratory information system (LIS).
◦ Include any pertinent comments regarding sample integrity
or QC issues.
3. Interpretation and Reporting:
◦ Results should be reported as IU/mL according to the
manufacturer’s reference ranges and interpretive criteria.
◦ Clearly communicate any critical or unusual results to the
appropriate healthcare provider promptly.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Internal QC:
◦ Perform QC testing at the beginning of each shift and with
each new lot of reagents.
◦ Follow any additional site-specific guidelines for QC
frequency.
2. Interlaboratory Comparison:
◦ Participate in external proficiency testing programs to
ensure the accuracy of the assay.
