Aspergillus (Galactomannan) Antigen, Serum - Analytical Phase
Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
1. PURPOSE
To outline the protocol for the analytical phase in the detection of
Aspergillus (Galactomannan) Antigen in serum samples in a CLIA-
certified laboratory. Ensuring accurate, reliable, and reproducible
results compliant with regulatory standards.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated trained staff are responsible for performing the analysis
of Aspergillus (Galactomannan) Antigen in serum, following the
standard protocol outlined in this SOP.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STORAGE
• Specimen Type: Serum
• Volume: Minimum of 1 mL serum is required.
• Collection Tube: Serum Separator Tube (SST)
• Storage: Specimens should be stored at 2-8°C and tested within
7 days of collection. For long-term storage, keep specimens
frozen at -20°C or below.
1. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
• Galactomannan Antigen Test Kit (e.g., Platelia™ Aspergillus Ag by
Bio-Rad)
• Microplate reader with 450 nm and 620/630 nm filters
• Micropipettes and tips
• Timer
• Vortex mixer
• Incubator set to 37°C
• Wash buffer, provided by the kit
1. PROCEDURE
2. Preparation:
◦ Verify the identity and suitability of the serum sample
(ensure proper labeling and sufficient volume).
◦ Equilibrate all reagents and samples to room temperature
(18-25°C) before starting the assay.
3. Assay Setup:
◦ Follow the manufacturer's instructions provided in the test kit
for the preparation of reagents and controls.
◦ Prepare the wash buffer, conjugate, substrate, and stop
solution as per kit instructions.
◦ Arrange standards, controls, and patient samples according
to the plate layout example provided in the kit or laboratory
guidelines.
4. Sample Loading:
◦ In duplicate, add 50 µL of each standard, control, and
patient sample to the appropriate microwells.
◦ Add 50 µL of the conjugate solution to each well.
◦ Gently tap the plate to mix and incubate at 37°C for 90
minutes.
5. Washing:
◦ Wash the wells with the wash buffer 5 times. Ensure
complete removal of the wash buffer after the final wash by
tapping the plate gently on absorbent paper.
6. Substrate Addition:
◦ Add 100 µL of the substrate solution to each well.
◦ Incubate at room temperature in the dark for 30 minutes.
7. Reaction Termination:
◦ Add 100 µL of the stop solution to each well and mix gently
by tapping the sides of the plate.
8. Reading the Plate:
◦ Measure the absorbance at 450 nm and reference at
620/630 nm using a microplate reader within 30 minutes of
adding the stop solution.
9. RESULT INTERPRETATION
• Calculate the mean absorbance value for each set of standards,
controls, and patient samples.
• Construct a standard curve by plotting the absorbance of
standards against their respective concentrations.
• Determine the concentration of Galactomannan antigen in the
patient samples from the generated standard curve.
Reference Range:
◦ A Galactomannan index value of ≥ 0.5 is considered positive.
◦ Values < 0.5 are considered negative.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Each run must include positive and negative controls.
• Review and document control results before reporting patient
results. Test results are invalid if the control values do not fall
within the specified range.
• Repeat the assay if controls fail to provide acceptable results.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If unexpected results or outlier control values are observed,
ensure that:
◦ Reagents are not expired.
◦ Pipettes are correctly calibrated.
◦ Adequate washing steps were performed.
◦ Plate reader settings are correct.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results must be reviewed and validated by the technologist.
• Transmit verified results to the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
• Note any incidents or deviations from the SOP in the laboratory
log.
