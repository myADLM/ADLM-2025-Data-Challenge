Standard Operating Procedure for ASPERGILLUS IGG
PRECIPITINS PANEL
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for performing and documenting
Aspergillus IgG Precipitins Panel tests to ensure quality and accuracy
of results.
Responsibility:
Designated staff will perform the Aspergillus IgG Precipitins Panel
tests as defined in this procedure. It is the responsibility of all staff to
adhere strictly to the steps mentioned in this SOP and to bring any
issues encountered to the attention of a supervisor immediately.
2. DEFINITION
The Aspergillus IgG Precipitins Panel test is used for the detection of
specific immunoglobulin G antibodies (precipitins) against Aspergillus
antigens, which are indicative of past or present infection with
Aspergillus species.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• Centrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Microplate reader capable of reading at the required wavelength
• Pipette and pipette tips (positive displacement recommended)
• Assay-specific microplates
• Standard buffer solutions
• Reagents for colorimetric or fluorescence detection (kit specific)
• Controls (positive and negative)
• Disposable gloves
• Lab coat
• Reagent grade water
4. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation
1. Specimen Handling:
◦ Ensure the sample has been accessioned and documented
accordingly.
◦ Specimens are primarily serum or plasma (EDTA or
heparin).
◦ Store specimens at 2-8°C for up to 48 hours or freeze at
-20°C for longer storage.
2. Reagent Preparation:
◦ Prepare all necessary reagents according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
◦ Allow reagents and patient samples to reach room
temperature before use.
B) Testing Procedure
1. Setup:
◦ Arrange all necessary materials (microplate, samples,
controls).
◦ Calibration of the microplate reader if required.
2. Sample Addition:
◦ Dispense appropriate volumes of patient samples, positive
controls, and negative controls into designated wells of the
microplate as specified by the assay kit instructions.
◦ Thoroughly mix the plate contents using the vortex mixer.
3. Incubation:
◦ Incubate the microplate at the specified temperature and
time duration according to the kit instructions.
4. Washing:
◦ Wash the wells using the recommended washing buffer,
following the specified number of wash cycles to ensure
removal of unbound substances.
5. Detection:
◦ Add the provided detection reagent (enzyme conjugate or
substrate) to each well.
◦ Incubate the microplate for the required time.
6. Reading:
◦ Read the results using a microplate reader set to the
specified wavelength.
◦ Document the raw data and ensure proper storage of results
(electronically or in a designated log).
C) Analysis and Interpretation:
• Compare the absorbance values of patient samples to those of
the positive and negative controls.
• Evaluate the results based on cut-off values provided by the
assay manufacturer.
• Critical results should be highlighted and immediately reported
according to the laboratory’s protocol for reporting critical values.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
• Ensure to run positive and negative controls with every batch of
patient samples.
• Document control results to monitor the performance of the assay.
• Periodically perform cross-checks and validations by comparing
results with other established tests or previous results from the
same patient.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results are verified and reviewed by the technologist before being
transmitted to the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Report any critical values immediately in accordance with the
laboratory’s guidelines for notifying healthcare providers.
7. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Refer to the assay manufacturer's instructions for specific
reference intervals pertaining to the detection of Aspergillus IgG
antibodies.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Ensure to review the assay kit insert for limitations specific to the
assay applied:
◦ Interference by heterophile antibodies
◦ Potential for assay cross-reactivity

controls, reference intervals, and limitations.
Documentation:
Keep all records including specimen ID, date/time of analysis,
technologist initials, and any anomalies or critical values noted during
the procedure.
