Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Aspergillus niger, IgE, Serum
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to provide detailed instructions for the
determination of serum IgE levels specific to Aspergillus niger using
immunoassay techniques. The protocol ensures consistent, accurate,
and reliable results and includes steps for quality control and
documentation.
2. RESPONSIBILITIES
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing the
analysis according to this SOP. It is the responsibility of all laboratory
staff to understand and comply with the procedures, reporting any
deviations or problems to the supervisor.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Acceptable Specimens:
• Serum collected in a red-top or SST (serum separator tube).
• The specimen must be properly labeled with the patient's name,
date of birth, and the date and time of collection.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed or lipemic samples.
• Incompletely filled tubes.
• Specimens collected in tubes with anticoagulants.
Specimen Handling and Storage:
• Specimens should be transported to the laboratory promptly.
• Store specimens at 2-8 °C if testing within 72 hours; otherwise,
freeze at -20 °C.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Immunoassay analyzer (e.g., ELISA reader or
chemiluminescence immunoassay system)
• Centrifuge
• Micropipettes and tips
• Vortex mixer
Reagents:
• Specific IgE assay kit for Aspergillus niger (follow manufacturer
instructions)
• Calibrators and controls
• Wash buffer
• Substrate solution
Supplies:
• Test tubes
• Microplate wells (if using ELISA)
• Disposable gloves
• Laboratory coats
5. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Allow all reagents and specimens to reach room temperature
before use.
2. Calibrate the immunoassay analyzer according to manufacturer
instructions.
Assay Procedure:
1. Sample Preparation: a. Centrifuge the serum sample for 10
minutes at 2,000-3,000 rpm to remove any particulate matter. b.
Transfer the clear supernatant to a clean microtube.
2. Assay Setup: a. Pipette the required volume of serum (as
specified in the assay kit manual) into the appropriate wells or
tubes. b. Add assay-specific reagents to each well or tube,
following the kit protocol precisely.
3. Incubation: a. Incubate the samples and reagents under
specified conditions and time (e.g., 37°C for 60 minutes).
4. Wash Steps: a. Follow the wash procedure as detailed in the
assay kit manual to remove unbound reagents.
5. Detection and Measurement: a. Add the substrate solution
and incubate for the recommended time (e.g., 15 minutes at
room temperature). b. Measure the optical density or perform
chemiluminescent detection using the immunoassay analyzer.
6. Calculation and Interpretation: a. Use the calibration curve to
determine the concentration of Aspergillus niger-specific IgE in
the serum sample. b. Interpret results according to reference
ranges provided by the assay manufacturer.
Quality Control:
1. Run positive and negative controls with each batch of samples.
2. Ensure all controls fall within the expected range before
reporting patient results.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
Results are transmitted to the LIS system automatically. Review and
verify results before releasing them. Document any unusual findings
or discrepancies and notify the supervisor immediately.
Reference Intervals:
• Reference intervals should be validated and provided according
to the manufacturer’s instructions and possibly adjusted according
to local population data.
7. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the assay kit insert for specific limitations regarding
interference and sensitivity. Note any factors that might affect the
accuracy of the IgE levels.
8. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's instructions for the specific IgE assay kit.
• Relevant peer-reviewed literature on Aspergillus niger IgE
immunoassays.
By following this SOP, laboratory personnel will ensure the accurate
analysis of Aspergillus niger-specific IgE serum levels, contributing to
the appropriate clinical diagnosis and patient care.
