Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
ASYMMETRIC DIMETHYLARGININE (ADMA) Testing
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for the accurate and efficient measurement
of asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) in plasma samples.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory technologists are responsible for performing
ADMA testing according to this SOP. They are also responsible for
ensuring all equipment is calibrated and maintained, quality control is
performed, and results are reported accurately.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen Type:
• Preferred: Plasma collected in EDTA tubes.
• Acceptable: Plasma collected in lithium heparin tubes.
Specimen Collection and Handling:
• Collect blood samples using standard venipuncture procedure.
• Mix gently and store samples immediately at 2-8°C.
• Plasma should be separated from cells within 2 hours of
collection.
• Aliquot and store plasma at -20°C for short-term storage or -80°C
for long-term storage (>3 months).
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) system with
fluorescence detector
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes and micropipettes
• Sample vials
• Refrigerators and freezers
Reagents:
• Mobile phase (such as acetonitrile and water mixture)
• Calibration standards for ADMA
• Internal standards for quantification
• Quality control materials
Supplies:
• Collection tubes (EDTA/heparin)
• Sample vials
• Calibration and QC logs
• Temperature monitoring log
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation:
1. Calibrate all instruments according to manufacturer instructions.
2. Prepare mobile phase and ensure proper pH adjustment as
required.
3. Prepare calibration standards in appropriate solvent.
4. Set up HPLC system and ensure that all parameters are
correctly configured.
B. Sample Preparation:
1. Thaw plasma samples at room temperature.
2. Centrifuge to separate out any precipitates; transfer
supernatant to clean vials.
3. Dilute samples, if necessary, using mobile phase.
4. Add internal standard to each sample for accurate
quantification.
5. Vortex and centrifuge samples.
C. HPLC Analysis:
1. Inject prepared samples into the HPLC system.
2. Monitor and record chromatograms and fluorescence signals of
eluted ADMA.
3. Compare to calibration standards to quantify ADMA
concentration in plasma.
D. Quality Control:
1. Run quality control samples alongside patient samples to
ensure accuracy and precision.
2. Record QC results and ensure they fall within acceptable limits.
3. Repeat analysis for any samples where QC fails.
E. Data Verification and Reporting:
1. Verify chromatograms and calculated concentrations.
2. Ensure no message codes or instrument errors are reported.
3. Review and validate results.
4. Transmit results to Laboratory Information System (LIS) and
document in patient records.
5. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Reference intervals for ADMA are determined by the institution's
established values.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Ensure that:
• Samples are not hemolyzed, turbid, or contain particulate matter.
• Proper storage conditions are maintained to prevent degradation
of ADMA.
• Interference from medications or other plasma components is
considered and interpreted according to clinical context.

• Manufacturer's instructions for HPLC system and reagents.
• Clinical practice guidelines for ADMA analysis.
1. DOCUMENTATION
Complete logs for instrument calibration, QC results, temperature
monitoring, and sample preparation must be maintained and
reviewed regularly. Ensure proper documentation of patient results
and critical values in the LIS.
