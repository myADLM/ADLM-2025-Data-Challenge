Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for ATRX Immunostain,
Technical Component Only
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedures necessary for the technical processing and
staining of tissue sections using ATRX (Alpha Thalassemia/Mental
Retardation Syndrome X-linked) immunohistochemistry (IHC)
protocols, ensuring consistency, accuracy, and reliability in
generating results.
Responsibility:
• Laboratory technicians and technologists are responsible for
performing and documenting all steps in the immunostaining
process accurately and according to the protocol.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Acceptable: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue
sections, 3-4 micrometers thick.
• Unacceptable: Specimens that are improperly fixed, excessively
dried, or otherwise compromised.
1. REAGENTS AND MATERIALS
• ATRX primary antibody (validated for IHC use)
• Detection kit (e.g., HRP-conjugated secondary antibody and DAB
substrate)
• IHC control slides
• Xylene, absolute ethanol, and descending ethanol series (95%,
80%, 70%)
• PBS (phosphate-buffered saline) or TBS (Tris-buffered saline)
• Antigen retrieval solution (e.g., citrate buffer or EDTA buffer)
• Hematoxylin for counterstaining
• Mounting media
1. EQUIPMENT
• Microtome
• Water bath at 60°C
• Automated IHC stainer (if available) or manual staining station
• Microscope
1. PROCEDURE
A. Pre-Staining
i. Sectioning
• Cut paraffin-embedded tissues into 3-4 micrometer sections using
a microtome.
• Place sections onto positively charged slides.
• Dry slides at 60°C for 1 hour to ensure proper section adhesion.
ii. Deparaffinization and Rehydration
• Place slides in xylene for 10 minutes (repeat twice).
• Sequentially place slides in absolute ethanol, then 95%, 80%, and
70% ethanol for 5 minutes each.
• Rinse slides in distilled water.
B. Antigen Retrieval
• Immerse slides in a suitable retrieval buffer (e.g., citrate buffer or
EDTA buffer) in a microwave or water bath.
• Heat slides at 95-100°C for 20-30 minutes.
• Allow slides to cool to room temperature for 20 minutes.
• Rinse slides in PBS or TBS.
C. Blocking
• Apply an appropriate blocking solution to cover the tissue sections
and incubate for 10-20 minutes to reduce nonspecific binding.
• Rinse with PBS or TBS.
D. Incubation with ATRX Primary Antibody
• Apply the ATRX primary antibody diluted according to the
manufacturer’s instructions to the tissue sections.
• Incubate in a humidified chamber for an appropriate duration
(e.g., 1 hour at room temperature or overnight at 4°C).
• Rinse slides in PBS or TBS.
E. Detection
• Apply the HRP-conjugated secondary antibody and incubate
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
• Rinse slides in PBS or TBS.
• Apply DAB substrate solution to develop the chromogen until the
desired staining intensity is achieved (monitor under a
microscope).
• Rinse slides in distilled water.
F. Counterstaining
• Immerse slides in hematoxylin stain for 1-2 minutes.
• Rinse in running tap water.
• Dehydrate through ascending ethanol series.
G. Mounting
• Clear slides in xylene for 5 minutes (repeat twice).
• Apply a cover slip using a suitable mounting medium.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include positive and negative control slides with each staining run
to validate antibody performance and staining procedure.
• Ensure all solutions and reagents are within their expiration dates
and have been prepared according to the recommended
guidelines.
1. DOCUMENTATION
• Document each step of the staining process, including reagent lot
numbers, incubation times, and any deviations from the standard
protocol.
• Record any observations regarding the quality of staining or
issues encountered.
1. RESULT INTERPRETATION
• This SOP covers only the technical staining component. The
interpretation of the stained slides will be performed by a qualified
pathologist who will analyze the intensity, distribution, and
specificity of ATRX staining.
