Protocol for Analytical Phase of Generating Results for ATYPICAL
HEMOLYTIC UREMIC SYNDROME (AHUS)/THROMBOTIC
MICROANGIOPATHY (TMA)/COMPLEMENT 3 GLOMERULOPATHY
(C3G) GENE PANEL, VARIES
1. PURPOSE
To ensure accurate and timely analysis of samples submitted for the
AHUS/TMA/C3G gene panel using Next Generation Sequencing
(NGS) technology. This protocol outlines the steps required for the
detection of genetic variants associated with these conditions.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory staff are responsible for
carrying out the procedures as outlined in this protocol and ensuring
all steps are followed meticulously to guarantee the integrity and
accuracy of the results.
1. DEFINITION
The AHUS/TMA/C3G gene panel includes genes known to be
associated with atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome, thrombotic
microangiopathy, and complement 3 glomerulopathy. These genes
typically include but are not limited to CFH, CFI, MCP (CD46), CFB,
CFHR1-5, and DGKE.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation
1. Ensure sample integrity and proper labeling.
2. Perform DNA extraction and quantification from the collected
blood or tissue samples according to the laboratory's standard
DNA extraction protocol.
3. Validate DNA quality and concentration using appropriate
quantification techniques (e.g., Qubit or Nanodrop, and quality
assessment using agarose gel electrophoresis).
4. Dilute the DNA sample to the required concentration for the
library preparation (typically >= 20ng/ul).
B. Library Preparation
1. Use a validated library preparation kit specific for NGS
applications. Follow manufacturer's instructions.
2. Perform DNA fragmentation as required (if shearing is needed
based on the system).
3. Construct DNA libraries ensuring proper adapter ligation, PCR
amplification, and indexing for sample identification.
4. Validate the quality and size distribution of the libraries using a
bioanalyzer or equivalent.
C. Sequencing
1. Load the libraries onto the sequencing platform (e.g., Illumina,
Ion Torrent) following the manufacturer's instructions.
2. Ensure proper calibration and setup of the sequencing
instrument.
3. Perform sequencing run according to the pre-established
parameters for depth and coverage suitable for the gene panel.
4. Monitor the sequencing process regularly to ensure it proceeds
without errors.
D. Data Analysis
1. Transfer raw sequencing data to the bioinformatics pipeline.
2. Perform initial data processing including base calling, alignment
to reference genome, and variant calling using validated
software packages.
3. Apply quality control measures to filter out low-quality reads
and artifacts.
4. Annotate detected variants with known databases (e.g., ClinVar,
dbSNP) relevant for clinical interpretation.
E. Interpretation and Reporting
1. Review and interpret the genetic variants with respect to their
pathogenic significance.
2. Consult relevant databases and literature for unknown or novel
variants.
3. Compile a comprehensive report detailing the detected genetic
variants and their clinical significance.
4. Include recommendations for further testing, genetic
counseling, or follow-up based on the findings.
5. Verify and sign off the report by qualified personnel before
submitting to the ordering physician.
Quality Control:
1. Include negative and positive controls in every batch of library
preparation and sequencing.
2. Perform internal quality checks and validations regularly to
ensure consistency of results.
3. Document any anomalies and troubleshooting steps taken
during the analytical phase.
References: Refer to standard operating procedures for DNA
extraction, NGS protocols, bioinformatics pipeline, and variant
interpretation guidelines.
This protocol must be reviewed regularly and updated according to
advancements in technology and best practices in genetic analysis.
