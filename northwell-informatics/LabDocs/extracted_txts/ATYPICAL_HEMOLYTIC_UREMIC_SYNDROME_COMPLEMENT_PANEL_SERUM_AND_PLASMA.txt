Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
ATYPICAL HEMOLYTIC UREMIC SYNDROME (aHUS)
COMPLEMENT PANEL, SERUM AND PLASMA
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this SOP is to outline the analytical
procedures for generating results of the ATYPICAL HEMOLYTIC
UREMIC SYNDROME (aHUS) Complement Panel using serum and
plasma samples. This procedure ensures the timely and accurate
analysis of patient samples to support the diagnosis and monitoring
of aHUS.
2. RESPONSIBILITY It is the responsibility of the designated
laboratory staff to perform the analytical procedures according to this
SOP. Staff must ensure that all equipment is properly calibrated,
quality controls are in place, and any issues that may affect the test
results are reported and addressed promptly.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
• Preferred Specimen: Serum and plasma collected in EDTA tubes
or serum separator tubes.
• Specimen Preparation: Samples must be centrifuged at
1500-2000g for 10-15 minutes within 2 hours of collection to
separate serum/plasma, which should be subsequently aliquoted
and stored at -80°C if not analyzed immediately.
• Stability:
◦ Serum/Plasma: Stable for up to 24 hours at room temperature,
7 days refrigerated (2-8°C), and up to 6 months when frozen
at -80°C.
• Unacceptable Specimens: Specimens received in incorrect
tubes, hemolyzed samples, samples not processed within 2 hours
of collection, and samples with improper labeling.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Complement panel test kits
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes
• Microcentrifuge tubes
• Calibrated ELISA reader
• Refrigerators and freezers (-80°C)
5. PROCEDURE
• Sample Processing:
1. Confirm the identity and proper labeling of the specimen.
2. Centrifuge the sample at 1500-2000g for 10-15 minutes.
3. Aliquot the serum/plasma into microcentrifuge tubes.
4. Perform testing immediately or store the aliquots at -80°C.
• Complement Panel Testing:
1. Thaw the frozen serum/plasma aliquots at room
temperature.
2. Prepare the complementary panel test kit reagents
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
3. Add the appropriate volume of serum/plasma to the wells of
the ELISA plate as specified by the kit.
4. Incubate the plate at room temperature for the specified
time in the manufacturer's protocol.
5. Wash the plate according to the kit protocol.
6. Add the detection antibodies and incubate as per
instructions.
7. Wash the plate again and add the substrate solution.
8. Measure the optical density at the appropriate wavelength
using the ELISA reader.
9. Calculate the complement levels using a standard curve
calibration.
6. QUALITY CONTROL AND CALIBRATION
• Run controls for each batch of tests:
◦ Positive controls: Known serum/plasma with established
complement levels.
◦ Negative controls: Serum/plasma lacking complement
proteins.
• Results from controls must fall within acceptable ranges as
defined by the kit manufacturer.
• Calibrate the ELISA reader annually and document all
calibrations.
• Validate each new lot of reagents by running parallel tests to
ensure consistency.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
• Analyze data from the ELISA reader and compare with the
standard curve.
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Review results against quality control standards.
• Verified results are to be reported following the site-specific
protocols for patient result dissemination.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• This test specifically measures specific complement proteins.
Interferences may occur due to hemolysis, lipemia, or icterus.
• Refer to the kit insert for detailed information on the method
limitations for each reagent.
9. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions and product inserts from complement
panel ELISA kits.
• CLIA regulations and guidelines.
10. REVIEW AND DOCUMENTATION
• Document all tests and procedures in the appropriate logs.
• Review and update this SOP annually or as needed when new
information becomes available.
This protocol ensures that the analytical phase for aHUS complement
panel is performed to the highest standard, ensuring reliability and
accuracy in diagnostic reporting.
