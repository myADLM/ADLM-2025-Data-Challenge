Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for AUDIOLOGENE HEARING LOSS PANEL
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to provide standardized instructions
for processing and analyzing specimens for the AUDIOLOGENE
Hearing Loss Panel in order to produce reliable and accurate genetic
test results that aid in the diagnosis of hereditary hearing loss.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel engaged in the testing of
the AUDIOLOGENE Hearing Loss Panel, utilizing designated
laboratory equipment, reagents, and software for genetic analysis.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
Laboratory personnel trained in molecular genetic techniques are
responsible for performing the steps outlined in this SOP. It is also the
responsibility of laboratory supervisors to ensure proper adherence to
this procedure and to handle any deviations or issues that may arise.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
4.1 Acceptable Specimens:
• Peripheral blood: Collected in EDTA (purple top) tubes.
• Saliva: Collected with an approved DNA stabilization kit.
• Buccal swabs: Collected using approved buccal swab collection
kits.
4.2 Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed blood samples.
• Saliva samples not collected with stabilization media.
• Buccal swabs that are improperly labeled or contaminated.
4.3 Specimen Handling:
• Blood specimens should be stored at 2–8°C and processed within
72 hours.
• Saliva specimens in stabilization media should be stored at room
temperature and processed within seven days.
• Buccal swabs should be stored at room temperature and
processed within 48 hours.

6. PROCEDURE
6.1 DNA Extraction:
• Extract DNA from the specimen using the designated DNA
extraction kit following the manufacturer's protocol.
• Quantify and assess the purity of extracted DNA using a
NanoDrop spectrophotometer or Qubit fluorometer.
• Document the concentration and purity ratios (A260/A280) in the
laboratory information system (LIS).
6.2 Library Preparation:
• Follow the appropriate NGS library preparation protocol for the
AUDIOLOGENE Hearing Loss Panel.
• Perform targeted amplification and capture of relevant genes
associated with hearing loss.
• Verify the quality and expected fragment sizes of the prepared
library via gel electrophoresis or a bioanalyzer.
6.3 Sequencing:
• Load the prepared library onto the NGS platform according to the
manufacturer’s guidelines.
• Enter required information into the sequencing software, including
sample IDs, indexes/adapters used, and run parameters.
• Initiate the sequencing run and monitor the progress.
6.4 Bioinformatics Analysis:
• Upon completion of sequencing, transfer data to the designated
bioinformatics pipeline for processing.
• Perform sequence alignment, variant calling, and annotation
against the human reference genome (hg19 or hg38).
• Apply quality control filters to ensure the integrity and reliability of
detected variants.
6.5 Data Interpretation:
• Review and interpret variants using reference databases and
published literature.
• Confirm pathogenicity and potential clinical significance of
identified variants.
• Document findings and interpretations in the LIS.
6.6 Reporting Results:
• Compile and generate the final report, ensuring it includes:
◦ Specimen information
◦ Methodology
◦ Detected variants and their clinical significance
◦ Interpretation and recommendations based on the results
• Send the report to the ordering physician or genetic counselor
through secure means.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
7.1 Internal Quality Control:
• Include positive and negative controls in each batch of DNA
extractions and NGS runs.
• Review and document control results before releasing patient
results.
• Perform regular calibration and maintenance of equipment
according to the manufacturer's instructions.
7.2 External Quality Assessment:
• Participate in external proficiency testing programs to assess the
accuracy and reliability of test results.
• Document and address any discrepancies from proficiency testing
in a corrective action log.
8. TROUBLESHOOTING
8.1 Equipment Malfunction:
• Refer to the equipment manual for troubleshooting steps.
• Contact technical support or service if the issue cannot be
resolved internally.
8.2 Poor DNA Quality/Inadequate Yield:
• Re-extract DNA from the specimen if the initial extraction fails to
meet quality or yield requirements.
• Ensure that the correct procedures for specimen collection and
storage are followed.
9. RECORD KEEPING AND DOCUMENTATION
9.1 Documentation:
• Maintain accurate and complete records of all tests performed,
including specimen details, reagents, equipment, results, and
quality control data.
9.2 Archiving:
• Store all raw sequencing data, analysis files, and reports securely
in accordance with data retention policies.
