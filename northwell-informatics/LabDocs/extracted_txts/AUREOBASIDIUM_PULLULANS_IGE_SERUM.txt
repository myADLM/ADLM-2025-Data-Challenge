Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Analytical Phase for
Generating Results of Aureobasidium Pullulans, IgE, Serum
1. PURPOSE:
To outline the standard procedure for the measurement and analysis
of Aureobasidium pullulans-specific Immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels in
serum samples.
2. RESPONSIBILITY:
It is the responsibility of designated personnel to perform the
analysis, document the results, and ensure the accuracy and
precision of the data. Monitoring quality control and validating
instruments is the collective responsibility of laboratory staff and
supervisors.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS:
Preferred Specimen: Serum
• Collect blood sample using a serum separation tube (SST) and
separate the serum within 2 hours of collection.
• Store serum at 2-8°C if analysis will be conducted within 7 days.
For longer storage, freeze serum at -20°C or lower.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
• Samples with no collection date/time indicated.
• Specimens not separated or tested within the required stability
period.
4. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS:
• ImmunoCAP system or equivalent for IgE antibodies detection.
• Specific Anti-Aureobasidium pullulans IgE reagent (calibrated and
within the expiry date).
• Quality control materials (positive control, negative control).
5. PROCEDURE:
A. Preparation:
• Ensure all equipment is calibrated, and quality control checks are
up-to-date.
• Thaw frozen serum samples at room temperature and mix gently
by inversion.
B. Assay Procedure:
1. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions provided with the
ImmunoCAP system or an equivalent.
2. Load reagents, controls, and patient samples onto the
instrument as per the instructions.
3. Select the assay for Aureobasidium pullulans IgE on the
instrument’s software.
4. Initiate the run and allow the instrument to process samples
according to the specified timeline.
C. Result Analysis:
1. Review the system-generated reports and ensure all quality
control measures fall within specified limits.
2. Assess the IgE levels against standard reference ranges
provided by the assay kit.
D. Interpretation:
• The levels of Aureobasidium pullulans IgE in serum are
interpreted as:
◦ Class 0: < 0.35 kUA/L (Negative)
◦ Class 1: 0.35-0.70 kUA/L (Borderline)
◦ Class 2: 0.70-3.50 kUA/L (Low)
◦ Class 3: 3.50-17.50 kUA/L (Moderate)
◦ Class 4: 17.50-50 kUA/L (High)
◦ Class 5: 50-100 kUA/L (Very High)
◦ Class 6: > 100 kUA/L (Extremely High)
E. Documentation and Reporting:
• Record all results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS) with
appropriate units and reference intervals.
• Ensure any discrepancies or outlier results are re-run or
rechecked.
• Document any deviations or anomalies in the analytical log book
with corrective actions taken.
6. QUALITY CONTROL:
• Run two levels of quality control sample (positive and negative)
with each batch of tests.
• If QC results fall outside of acceptable ranges, do not report
patient results until troubleshooting and corrective actions have
been performed and QC falls within range.
• Document all QC runs and any maintenance or troubleshooting
actions in the QC log.
7. REFERENCES:
• Manufacturer’s Instructions (ImmunoCAP or equivalent system’s
assay guide).
• Laboratory Quality Assurance Manual.
• Relevant Clinical Guidelines for IgE Testing.
8. NOTES:
• All personnel performing the analysis must be trained and
documented competent.
• Safety protocols must be adhered to at all times, including the use
of PPE.
• Ensure all waste is disposed of in accordance with local
biomedical waste disposal regulations.
By adhering to this SOP, the laboratory ensures reliable and
reproducible results for Aureobasidium pullulans IgE serology,
contributing to accurate diagnosis and patient care.
