Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Analytical Phase: Generating Results for Australian
Pine, IgE, Serum
1. Purpose
To outline the procedures for the analysis and reporting of serum
specific IgE levels to Australian Pine allergen using the appropriate
methodologies. This SOP ensures accurate, reliable, and
reproducible results.
2. Scope
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel performing serum
specific IgE testing for Australian Pine allergen in a CLIA-certified
laboratory.
3. Definitions
Australian Pine, IgE: Immunoglobulin E specific to Australian Pine
allergen, which may be measured to diagnose an allergic response.
4. Responsibility
• Laboratory personnel are responsible for following this SOP to
ensure accurate testing and reporting.
• The laboratory supervisor is responsible for the overall
compliance and training of staff on this SOP.
5. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies
• Automated Immunoassay Analyzer (e.g., Phadia ImmunoCAP,
Siemens ADVIA Centaur)
• Serum samples
• IgE-specific calibrators and controls
• Australian Pine allergen-specific reagent cartridges or kits
• Pipettes and tips
• Reagent reservoirs
• Barcode scanner (if applicable)
• Laboratory Information System (LIS)
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
6. Procedure
A. Pre-analytical Check
1. Sample Identification and Preparation:
◦ Verify patient and sample identification using barcode
scanning or manual checking if a barcode is not used.
◦ Confirm that samples are serum and have been stored
appropriately (2-8°C for up to 72 hours or frozen at -20°C for
longer storage).
2. Reagent and Equipment Preparation:
◦ Prepare the analyzer according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
◦ Load the Australian Pine-specific IgE cartridges/reagents
into the analyzer.
◦ Ensure calibrators and controls are available and within
expiration dates.
◦ Perform any needed daily maintenance or startup checks on
the analyzer as per manufacturer's manual.
B. Instrument Calibration
1. Calibrate the analyzer using the IgE-specific calibrators
provided in the kit. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for
calibration.
2. Documentation of calibration should be maintained in the
equipment logbook.
C. Quality Control (QC)
1. Run both positive and negative controls provided in the kit to
ensure accuracy and reliability of the test.
2. Document the results of the controls in the QC log.
3. Investigation and corrective action are required if controls fall
outside the established acceptable range, then recalibrate the
equipment if necessary before proceeding with patient samples.
D. Sample Analysis
1. Load patient specimens into designated positions on the
analyzer.
2. Input or scan patient information into the analyzer or LIS.
3. Start the analysis, ensuring that each sample is processed in
accordance with the manufacturer's instructions.
4. The test results will be automatically generated by the analyzer
upon completion.
E. Result Validation and Reporting
1. Review the results for each sample to ensure they meet quality
criteria.
2. Any test flagged by the analyzer or showing anomalies should
be repeated or confirmed by an alternative method.
3. Enter results into the LIS for final verification and report
generation.
4. Report results to the ordering healthcare provider, ensuring
they are entered into the patient's medical record according to
site-specific reporting guidelines.
7. Method Limitations
1. Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples may affect the accuracy
of results. Such samples should be managed according to
laboratory protocol.
2. Ensure samples with known interferences are appropriately
flagged or commented upon in the test report.
8. Reference Intervals
• The reference interval for specific IgE levels will be obtained from
the kit insert or instrument manufacturer guidelines, typically
ranging from undetectable to high levels, indicating probable
sensitization to the allergen.
9. Documentation and Records
1. Maintain all records of sample identification, calibration, QC,
and patient results.
2. Ensure that all logs including instrument maintenance,
calibration, QC, and test results are retained as per laboratory
record retention policies.
