STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE
Autism Antibody Testing
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the analytical phase of
autism antibody testing to ensure consistent and accurate results.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all designated staff in the laboratory who
are responsible for performing autism antibody testing.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• It is the responsibility of designated laboratory staff to perform
autism antibody tests following this SOP.
• Supervisors are responsible for overseeing the process and
resolving any issues that may arise during the testing process.
4. DEFINITIONS
AUTISM ANTIBODY TESTING: A test to detect the presence of
specific antibodies that may be associated with autism spectrum
disorder (ASD).
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
- **Acceptable Specimens**: Serum or plasma collected in serum separator tubes (SST) or EDTA tubes.
- **Unacceptable Specimens**: Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples; specimens collected in anticoagulants other than EDTA.
6. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
- ELISA Reader
- Microplate Washer
- Pipettes and sterile tips
- Incubator (37°C)
- Autism Antibody ELISA Kit: Follow manufacturer's storage instructions.
- Calibrated Timer
- Plate shaker
- Computer with relevant software for data analysis
7. PROCEDURE
1. **Preparation**
1.1. Ensure all reagents and equipment are at room temperature before starting the assay.
1.2. Label all samples and controls clearly.
2. **Reagent Preparation**
2.1. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions to prepare reagents and controls.
2.2. Reconstitute any lyophilized materials as specified by the kit insert.
3. **Assay Procedure**
3.1. **Sample Addition**
- Pipette the specified volume of each sample, standard, and control into the appropriate wells of the microplate.
- Include blank wells containing only assay buffer.
3.2. **Incubation**
- Incubate the microplate at 37°C for the time specified in the kit instructions.
- Ensure the plate is covered to prevent evaporation and contamination.
3.3. **Washing**
- Wash the wells with the wash buffer provided in the kit using the microplate washer.
- Follow the washing steps as per the manufacturer’s instruction, typically 3-5 times.
3.4. **Secondary Antibody Addition**
- Add the prescribed volume of secondary antibody conjugate to each well.
- Incubate the plate at the specified temperature and duration.
3.5. **Substrate Addition**
- Add the substrate solution to each well.
- Incubate the plate in the dark to prevent light interference.
3.6. **Stopping Reaction**
- Add the stop solution to each well to terminate the enzymatic reaction.
3.7. **Reading the Plate**
- Read the optical density (OD) of each well using an ELISA reader set to the appropriate wavelength as specified by the kit protocol.
4. **Data Analysis**
4.1. Enter the OD readings into the corresponding software for analysis.
4.2. Generate a standard curve using the standards provided and calculate the concentration of autism antibodies in the samples.
5. **Quality Control**
5.1. Run positive and negative controls with each batch of tests to ensure assay accuracy.
5.2. Document control results and ensure they fall within the acceptable range specified by the manufacturer.
5.3. If controls fall outside the acceptable range, identify and resolve issues before retesting samples.
6. **Result Reporting**
6.1. Verify all results against the established criteria.
6.2. Document any anomalies or deviations observed during the test process.
6.3. Record and approve results before entering them into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
6.4. Report results according to site-specific reporting guidelines.
8. TROUBLESHOOTING
- If the assay shows unexpected results or failures, follow the troubleshooting guide provided in the kit insert.
- Ensure that all equipment is functioning properly and recalibrate if necessary.
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
- Refer to the manufacturer's kit insert for potential interferences and limitations of the assay.

11. DOCUMENT REVISION
- This SOP should be reviewed annually or whenever there is a change in process or equipment.
By following this SOP, laboratory staff will ensure the reliable and
reproducible performance of autism antibody testing.
