Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Autoimmune Liver
Disease Panel, Serum
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the analytical procedures for processing and
generating results for the Autoimmune Liver Disease Panel, Serum,
including quality control and reporting guidelines.
Responsibility:
• Technologists are responsible for performing the test according to
this procedure.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring adherence to the
protocol and addressing any issues that arise during the testing
process.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND HANDLING
Preferred/Acceptable Specimen:
• Serum collected in a serum separator tube (SST)
• Minimum volume required: 3 mL
• Specimen should be properly labeled with the patient’s name, ID
number, date, and time of collection.
• Transport specimen to the laboratory immediately.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric specimens
• Specimens that have not been properly labeled
• Specimens received more than 48 hours after collection without
proper refrigeration (2-8°C)
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Automated immunoassay analyzer (e.g., ELISA microplate
reader)
• Pipettes and tips
• Centrifuge
• Reagents for Autoimmune Liver Disease Panel, including:
◦ Anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA)
◦ Anti-smooth muscle antibodies (ASMA)
◦ Anti-liver kidney microsomal antibodies (LKM)
◦ Anti-mitochondrial antibodies (AMA)
• Control sera (positive and negative controls)
1. PROCEDURE
A. Pre-Analytical Phase:
1. Verify patient and specimen information upon receipt.
2. Centrifuge SST tubes at 1500 x g for 10 minutes to separate
serum.
3. Aliquot serum into appropriately labeled secondary containers if
necessary.
B. Analytical Phase:
1. Allow all reagents and patient samples to come to room
temperature (15-30°C) before use.
2. Set up the analyzer according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
3. Load patient samples, positive and negative controls, and
calibration standards into the analyzer.
4. Follow the specific assay protocol for each test component
(e.g., ANA, ASMA, LKM, AMA): a. Pipette appropriate volumes
of serum, controls, and reagents into the designated wells or
sample cups. b. Incubate as required by the assay’s protocol. c.
Wash steps must be carried out as outlined in the assay
protocol. d. Add substrate and incubate according to the assay
instructions. e. Measure absorbance/optical density at the
specified wavelength using the microplate reader.
5. Ensure internal quality control measures are in place, checking
the results of positive and negative controls.
C. Post-Analytical Phase:
1. Analyze the results using the analyzer’s software.
2. Validate the results of patient samples, ensuring that controls
are within acceptable ranges.
3. If control results fall outside acceptable limits, troubleshoot
according to the manufacturer’s guidelines or lab-specific
protocols.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run positive and negative controls with each batch of patient
samples.
• Perform instrument calibration regularly, according to the
manufacturer’s specifications.
• Document all controls, calibrations, and any troubleshooting
measures taken.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Enter the results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Review and verify results before releasing them.
• Document any unusual findings or deviations from the expected
result in the patient’s record and notify the ordering physician if
necessary.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA): Negative
• Anti-smooth muscle antibodies (ASMA): Negative
• Anti-liver kidney microsomal antibodies (LKM): Negative
• Anti-mitochondrial antibodies (AMA): Negative (Reference
intervals should be calibrated according to the assay kit used and
population-specific data.)
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolysis, lipemia, or icterus in specimens may interfere with test
results.
• Cross-reactivity with other autoantibodies may occur;
interpretation should be in the context of clinical findings and
other diagnostic tests.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instruction manuals for the Autoimmune Liver
Disease Panel.
• Current Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI)
guidelines.
• Relevant peer-reviewed journals and textbooks regarding
autoimmune liver disease diagnostics.
