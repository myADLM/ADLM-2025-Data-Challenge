Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase of Generating Results for Autoimmune
Lymphoproliferative Syndrome (ALPS) Gene Panel, Varies
1. PURPOSE
This protocol details the analytical phase procedure for generating
results for the Autoimmune Lymphoproliferative Syndrome (ALPS)
Gene Panel. This includes the processing, analysis, and
interpretation of ALPS Gene Panel test results.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory staff are responsible for
performing the steps outlined in this procedure. It is the responsibility
of all laboratory personnel to recognize any discrepancies or issues
during the testing process and report them to a supervisor.
1. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all staff involved in the analytical phase of
ALPS Gene Panel testing in a CLIA-certified laboratory.
1. DEFINITIONS
Autoimmune Lymphoproliferative Syndrome (ALPS): A condition
wherein the immune system produces an excessive number of
immune cells, leading to lymphoproliferation and autoimmunity.
Gene Panel: A panel of genes known to be associated with ALPS that
are sequenced to identify pathogenic variants.

9. PROCEDURE
5.1 DNA EXTRACTION
• Ensure that the samples meet the pre-analytic criteria (i.e.,
appropriately stored and labeled).
• Perform the DNA extraction using an approved DNA extraction kit
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
• Quantify the DNA using a spectrophotometer or fluorometer to
ensure adequate concentration and purity.
• Document DNA quantity, quality, and any deviations from
expected outcomes in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
5.2 LIBRARY PREPARATION
• Dilute the extracted DNA to the required concentration for library
preparation.
• Perform PCR amplification of target genes within the ALPS panel.
• Purify the PCR products using the appropriate purification kits or
magnetic beads.
• Quantify and verify the size of the amplified products using an
appropriate method such as gel electrophoresis or a bioanalyzer.
• Prepare sequencing libraries according to the protocol for the
NGS platform in use.
5.3 NEXT-GENERATION SEQUENCING
• Load the libraries onto the NGS platform following the instrument
manufacturer’s guidelines.
• Perform sequencing run, ensuring that all quality control metrics
fall within acceptable limits.
• Monitor the run parameters, such as cluster density and quality
score, throughout the sequencing process.
• Upon completion, save raw sequence data and perform a
preliminary quality check.
5.4 BIOINFORMATICS ANALYSIS
• Analyze sequencing data using bioinformatics pipelines, which
include base calling, alignment to the reference genome, and
variant calling.
• Apply filters to identify variants of interest relevant to the ALPS
gene panel.
• Cross-validate the identified variants with known ALPS-associated
mutations.
5.5 DATA REVIEW AND INTERPRETATION
• Review bioinformatics analysis results, including variant
annotation and classification.
• Correlate identified variants with clinical significance using
databases such as ClinVar, OMIM, and literature review.
• Prepare a draft report of the findings, including any identified
pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants relevant to ALPS.
5.6 QUALITY CONTROL
• Ensure all reagents and instruments used have not expired and
are functioning properly.
• Include positive and negative controls with each run to confirm
assay performance.
• Periodically calibrate instruments following manufacturer’s
instructions.
• Perform repeat testing of any outlier results to confirm accuracy.
• Document all quality control activities and any corrective actions
taken.
5.7 RESULT REPORTING
• Generate the final report with the reviewed and interpreted
results.
• Submit the report to the designated pathologist or geneticist for
final review and sign-off.
• Integrate the approved report into the Laboratory Information
System (LIS) for electronic delivery to the ordering physician.
1. RECORD KEEPING AND DOCUMENTATION
• Maintain accurate records of all tested samples, including DNA
extraction, library preparation, sequencing, and bioinformatics
analysis.
• Ensure all documentation meets regulatory requirements,
following CLIA guidelines.
• Store all data, including raw sequence files, analysis outputs, and
final reports, securely and in compliance with data protection
regulations.

1. QUALITY ASSURANCE
• Internal audits will be conducted periodically to ensure
compliance with SOPs.
• Review and update this SOP annually or as required based on
new advancements or regulatory changes.
• Staff training and competency assessments will be conducted
regularly to maintain high standards of laboratory practice.
This SOP ensures reliable and accurate results in the analytical
phase of the ALPS Gene Panel testing process, contributing to the
timely diagnosis and effective management of patients with
Autoimmune Lymphoproliferative Syndrome.
