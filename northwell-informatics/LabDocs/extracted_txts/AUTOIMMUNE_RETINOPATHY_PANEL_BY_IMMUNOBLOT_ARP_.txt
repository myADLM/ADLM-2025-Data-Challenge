Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
AUTOIMMUNE RETINOPATHY PANEL by IMMUNOBLOT (ARP)
1. PURPOSE
To provide a step-by-step procedure for the accurate, precise, and
consistent analysis and generation of results for the Autoimmune
Retinopathy Panel by Immunoblot (ARP).
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing
the analysis, recording the results, and ensuring quality control
procedures are followed.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring the proper training of
personnel and for overseeing the operation and quality assurance
of the immunoblot procedure.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen: Serum collected in a red-top tube without
anticoagulant.
• Minimum volume: 1.0 mL.
• Stability: Store at 2-8°C for up to 48 hours. For long-term storage,
freeze at -20°C or lower.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Immunoblot assay kit specific for Autoimmune Retinopathy Panel.
• Electrophoresis apparatus and power supply.
• Nitrocellulose or PVDF membrane.
• Blocking solution.
• Primary antibodies specific to retinal proteins (as specified in the
assay kit).
• Secondary antibodies conjugated to an appropriate enzyme (e.g.,
HRP).
• Substrate solution for detection (e.g., chemiluminescent
substrate).
• Wash buffer (e.g., Tris-buffered saline-Tween 20, TBS-T).
• Incubator or shaking platform.
• Imaging system for detecting and documenting the immunoblot
results.
• Laboratory timer.
• Logger for recording temperatures and humidities.
• PPE including gloves, lab coat, and eye protection.
1. PROCEDURE
Step 1: Preparation of Samples and Reagents
• Thaw serum samples if frozen and bring to room temperature.
• Prepare all reagents and buffers according to the instructions
provided with the immunoblot assay kit.
Step 2: Gel Electrophoresis
• Load 10 µL of each sample, including positive and negative
controls provided by the kit, into wells of an SDS-PAGE gel.
• Run the gel under the conditions specified by the kit (usually 100V
for ~1.5 hours).
Step 3: Transfer to Membrane
• Transfer the proteins from the gel to a nitrocellulose or PVDF
membrane using a wet transfer system. Transfer at 100V for 1
hour.
• Confirm successful transfer by staining the membrane with
Ponceau S and de-staining to reveal protein bands.
Step 4: Blocking
• Block the membrane in blocking solution (e.g., 5% non-fat dry
milk in TBS-T or blocking buffer provided) for 1 hour at room
temperature with gentle shaking.
Step 5: Incubation with Primary Antibodies
• Incubate the membrane with the primary antibody solution
(antibody specific to retinal proteins) as recommended by the kit
(usually overnight at 4°C with gentle shaking).
Step 6: Washing
• Wash the membrane 3 times for 10 minutes each with wash
buffer (TBS-T).
Step 7: Incubation with Secondary Antibodies
• Incubate the membrane with the enzyme-conjugated secondary
antibody solution for 1 hour at room temperature.
Step 8: Final Washing
• Wash the membrane 3 times for 10 minutes each with wash
buffer (TBS-T).
Step 9: Detection
• Develop the immunoblot using the appropriate substrate solution
(chemiluminescent or colorimetric) as per the kit instructions.
• Visualize and document the results using an imaging system.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run positive and negative controls provided in the kit with each
batch of samples to verify assay performance.
• Document all steps and record any deviations.
• Implement internal quality control measures and compare results
to ensure consistency.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Evaluate the bands associated with each sample.
• Compare with control bands to determine the presence or
absence of autoantibodies against retinal proteins.
• Generate a report according to laboratory guidelines and include
observations, interpretations, and any abnormalities in the results.
1. SAMPLE INTEGRITY
• Assess the integrity of samples prior to analysis. If hemolysis or
other issues are observed, consult with a supervisor for further
actions.
• Document any issues with sample integrity in the reporting
system.

1. NOTES
• Ensure that all personnel handling and processing the samples
are trained and competent in immunoblot techniques.
• Maintain all equipment appropriately and perform scheduled
calibration and maintenance.
