Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Autoinflammatory Disorders Gene Panel
1. PURPOSE
This procedure describes the necessary steps for the analysis of
specimens submitted for the Autoinflammatory Disorders Gene
Panel. The protocol ensures accurate, reliable, and reproducible
analytical results for diagnosing genetic mutations associated with
autoinflammatory disorders.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
Laboratory technologists and genetic analysts are responsible for
following the outlined processes for the analysis. It is the
responsibility of the laboratory supervisor to ensure compliance,
quality control, and timely review of results.
3. DEFINITIONS
• Autoinflammatory Disorders: Inherited disorders characterized by
episodes of inflammation without high-titer autoantibodies or
autoreactive T cells.
• Gene Panel: A diagnostic test that sequences a group of genes
related to a particular disease.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Type: Whole blood, bone marrow, or extracted DNA.
◦ Whole blood: Use EDTA (lavender-top) tubes.
◦ Bone marrow: Use heparin or EDTA tubes.
◦ Extracted DNA: Store in TE Buffer or equivalent.
• Volume:
◦ Whole blood: Minimum 3 mL.
◦ Bone marrow: Minimum 1 mL.
◦ Extracted DNA: Minimum of 5 µg at a concentration of at least
50 ng/µL.
• Stability and Transport:
◦ Whole blood and bone marrow: Store at 2-8°C, stable for 7
days.
◦ Extracted DNA: Store at -20°C or lower, stable for up to 6
months.
◦ Avoid freeze-thaw cycles.
5. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• DNA extraction kits (e.g., Qiagen DNA Mini Kit).
• PCR machines and related reagents.
• Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) platform (e.g., Illumina
MiSeq).
• DNA quantification and quality control instruments (e.g., Qubit,
NanoDrop).
• Bioinformatics software for data analysis (e.g., BWA, GATK, IGV).
6. PROCEDURE
A. DNA Extraction
1. Whole Blood/Bone Marrow:
◦ Use appropriate DNA extraction kit following the
manufacturer's protocol.
◦ Elute DNA in a final volume of 100 µL TE buffer.
2. Quality Control:
◦ Measure DNA concentration using Qubit or NanoDrop.
◦ Assess integrity and purity (A260/A280 ratio).
B. Library Preparation
1. Fragmentation:
◦ Fragment DNA to 150-200 bp using enzymatic or
mechanical shearing.
2. End Repair and A-tailing:
◦ Perform end repair and A-tailing according to the NGS
library preparation protocol.
3. Adapter Ligation:
◦ Ligate sequencing adapters compatible with the NGS
platform.
4. PCR Enrichment:
◦ Amplify the adapter-ligated DNA using PCR.
C. Target Enrichment
1. Hybridization:
◦ Hybridize the PCR products with biotinylated probes specific
to the gene panel.
2. Capture:
◦ Capture target regions using streptavidin beads.
3. Post-Capture Amplification:
◦ Amplify captured libraries with PCR.
D. Sequencing
1. Load Library:
◦ Load the enriched library onto the NGS platform.
2. Run Sequencing:
◦ Perform sequencing according to the instrument
manufacturer’s protocol.
E. Data Analysis
1. Base Calling and Demultiplexing:
◦ Use sequencing software for initial base calling and
demultiplexing of reads.
2. Alignment and Variant Calling:
◦ Align reads to the reference genome (e.g., hg19) using
BWA.
◦ Call variants using GATK.
3. Annotation:
◦ Annotate identified variants using annotation tools (e.g.,
ANNOVAR).
F. Interpretation and Reporting
1. Variant Classification:
◦ Classify variants based on ACMG guidelines.
2. Technical Review:
◦ Review sequencing coverage, quality metrics, and variant
data.
3. Clinical Reporting:
◦ Generate a clinical report including significant variants, their
potential impact, and relevant clinical correlations.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include positive and negative control samples throughout the
process.
• Use internal quality control standards as part of the assay
validation.
• Routine verification and calibration of instruments.
• Participation in external proficiency testing programs.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results are reviewed and verified by the laboratory technologist
before being reported.
• Critical findings are communicated immediately to the ordering
physician.
• Final report is issued according to laboratory turnaround time
standards.
9. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's manuals and package inserts for all reagents and
instruments used.
• ACMG Standards and Guidelines for the Interpretation of
Sequence Variants.
