Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase - Generating Results for AVOCADO IGE,
SERUM
Purpose: This SOP outlines the procedures for the analytical phase
in generating serum IgE results specific to avocados (AVOCADO,
IGE, SERUM). It includes steps for specimen preparation, equipment
usage, quality control, result reporting, and corrective actions.
Responsibility: It is the responsibility of the trained laboratory
personnel to follow this SOP accurately to ensure reliable test results.
Laboratory supervisors are responsible for overseeing the process
and addressing any issues.
Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies:
• ImmunoCAP Specific IgE System
• AVOCADO IgE test kits
• Serum sample
• Pipettes
• Incubator
• Centrifuge
• Refrigerators/Freezers (for reagent and sample storage)
• Laboratory timer
Specimen Requirements:
• Preferred/acceptable: Serum samples, collected via
venipuncture. The specimen should be centrifuged, and serum
separated within 2 hours of collection.
• Unacceptable: Hemolyzed, lipemic, or improperly labeled
specimens, samples received more than 48 hours post-collection
if not stored at 2-8°C.
Procedure:
1. Preparation:
◦ Verify the specimen condition and paperwork.
◦ Ensure the specimen is at room temperature.
◦ Label tubes clearly with patient identification.
2. Calibration and Setup:
◦ Ensure the ImmunoCAP Specific IgE System is calibrated
according to the manufacturer's instructions.
◦ Validate the calibration using control samples to ensure
accuracy.
◦ Set up the AVOCADO IgE test kits.
3. Sample Loading:
◦ Using a pipette, load the serum sample into the test kit.
◦ Activate the system to start the test as per the
manufacturer's protocol.
4. Incubation:
◦ Place the loaded kit in the incubator and set the timer
according to the kit instructions.
◦ Ensure temperature monitoring within target limits (37°C ±
1°C).
5. Wash Steps:
◦ Perform necessary wash steps as specified in the kit
instructions.
◦ Ensure thorough washing to avoid contamination or errors.
6. Detection:
◦ Add the detection reagent as per kit instructions.
◦ Incubate again if required.
◦ Read and document the IgE level.
Quality Control:
• Include positive and negative controls with each batch of tests.
• Control results should fall within specified ranges. Report and
investigate if control results are outside specified limits.
• Run and document quality control materials as per site-specific
guidelines and manufacturer's protocols.
Recording Results:
• Results are documented immediately upon completion of the test.
• Review results for any discrepancies or abnormal values.
• Transmit results electronically to the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
Reporting Results:
• Verify results in LIS.
• Report any critical values following site-specific guidelines for
critical value notification.
• Add comments if results fall outside expected ranges stating
potential interferences or invalid results.
Corrective Actions:
1. Deviation Identification:
◦ Recognize any deviations or abnormal results.
◦ Inspect the equipment and reagents for possible defects.
2. Troubleshooting:
◦ Re-evaluate specimen handling processes.
◦ Verify calibration and control results.
◦ Repeat the test if necessary. Document all steps taken.
3. Supervisor Notification:
◦ Notify the supervisor immediately if any inconsistencies
persist.
◦ Follow supervisor recommendations for corrective actions.
