Standard Operating Procedure: Analytical Phase of Generating
Results for AVOCADO IGG
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is to
provide detailed instructions for the analytical phase of generating
results for Avocado IgG testing, ensuring accuracy and reliability of
test results.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the
Avocado IgG test according to this SOP. Laboratory supervisors are
responsible for ensuring adherence to these protocols and
addressing any issues that arise during testing.
1. DEFINITION
Avocado IgG testing refers to the measurement of Immunoglobulin G
(IgG) antibodies specific to avocado proteins in human serum or
plasma samples. This assay is used to diagnose avocado-specific
food allergies or sensitivities.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/acceptable:
• Serum: Collect blood in a red-top tube and centrifuge to separate
serum.
• Plasma: Collect blood in an EDTA or heparinized tube and
centrifuge to separate plasma.
Unacceptable:
• Samples with visible hemolysis.
• Samples collected in tubes containing other additives such as
sodium citrate or fluoride.
Ensure specimens are correctly labeled with patient identification,
collection date, and time.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) kit for Avocado IgG.
• Microtiter plates.
• Incubator.
• Plate reader.
• Pipettes and tips.
• Wash buffer (as specified in the ELISA kit instructions).
• Substrate solution.
• Stop solution.
• Sample diluent.
• Positive and negative controls.
1. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Ensure that all reagents and samples are at room temperature
before starting the assay.
2. Set up the microtiter plates according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
3. Prepare wash buffer and diluent as per the kit instructions.
Sample Handling:
1. Dilute serum or plasma samples appropriately using the sample
diluent provided in the kit. Typically, a 1:100 dilution is
recommended.
2. For each test, include positive and negative controls, as well as
blank wells.
Assay Procedure:
1. Add 100 μL of diluted samples, standards, controls, and blanks
to each well.
2. Incubate the plate at 37°C for 1 hour.
3. Wash the plate thoroughly with wash buffer (typically 3-5 times)
to remove unbound components.
4. Add 100 μL of enzyme conjugate to each well and incubate at
37°C for 30 minutes.
5. Wash the plate again with wash buffer (typically 3-5 times).
6. Add 100 μL of substrate solution to each well and incubate in
the dark at room temperature for 15-30 minutes, until color
development is sufficient.
7. Add 100 μL of stop solution to each well to halt the reaction.
8. Read the plate at the appropriate wavelength (usually 450 nm)
using a plate reader.
Troubleshooting:
• If the positive control fails to produce valid results or the blank
shows significant absorbance, repeat the assay with fresh
reagents.
• Document any issues encountered and corrective actions taken.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
Internal Controls:
• Positive and negative controls must be included in every assay
run.
• Controls must meet specified criteria for the assay to be
considered valid.
External Controls:
• External proficiency testing must be conducted periodically to
ensure test accuracy.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
Data Analysis:
• Calculate the mean absorbance for duplicate samples.
• Use the standard curve to determine the concentration of
Avocado IgG in each sample.
Reference Intervals:
• Establish cut-off values based on clinical validation studies.
Typically, results are reported as positive, negative, or
indeterminate based on these values.
Result Verification and Documentation:
• Verify all results internally using quality control data.
• Document results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS) and
ensure proper reporting according to site-specific guidelines.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions for the Avocado IgG ELISA kit.
• Relevant clinical guidelines and validation studies.
1. REVISIONS AND UPDATES
• This SOP must be reviewed and revised annually or whenever
new information or protocols are introduced.
