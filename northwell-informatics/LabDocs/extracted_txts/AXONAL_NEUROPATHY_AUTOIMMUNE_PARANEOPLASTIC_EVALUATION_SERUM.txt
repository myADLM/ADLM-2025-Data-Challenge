Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for AXONAL
NEUROPATHY, AUTOIMMUNE/PARANEOPLASTIC EVALUATION,
SERUM
1. PURPOSE:
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the analytical procedures for the
evaluation of axonal neuropathy, autoimmune/paraneoplastic
evaluation in serum samples. The steps detailed in this protocol
ensure consistency, accuracy, and adherence to CLIA standards
throughout the analytical phase.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of qualified laboratory personnel to perform the
analytical procedures in compliance with this SOP and ensure the
accuracy and reliability of results reported for axonal neuropathy,
autoimmune/paraneoplastic evaluations in serum samples.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS:
a. Specimen Type: Serum b. Collection Tube: Serum separator tube
(SST) or plain red-top tube c. Volume: Minimum 1 mL of serum d.
Stability: Serum samples should be processed and stored at 2-8°C
for up to 72 hours or frozen at -20°C or colder for longer storage.
1. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES:
• Centrifuge
• Refrigerated storage
• Freezer (-20°C or colder)
• Micropipettes and tips
• Vortex mixer
• ELISA plate reader (as applicable)
• Appropriate assay kits and reagents (e.g., autoantibody assays,
immunoassay kits)
• Laboratory timer
1. PROCEDURE:
A. PREPARING THE SERUM SAMPLE:
1. Upon receipt of the serum sample, verify correct labeling and
required volume.
2. Centrifuge the specimen at 1500-2000 x g for 10-15 minutes to
separate serum from clot.
3. Carefully transfer the serum into a labeled aliquot tube without
disturbing the cellular layer.
4. If the sample is not to be analyzed immediately, store at 2-8°C
(for up to 72 hours) or freeze at -20°C or colder for long-term
storage.
B. AUTOANTIBODY SCREENING:
The autoantibody screening step may be performed using specific
immunoassay techniques. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for
the specific assays used for detecting pertinent autoantibodies.
1. Thaw frozen samples at room temperature or retrieve
refrigerated samples.
2. Equilibrate all reagents to room temperature prior to use.
3. Pipette the required amount of serum into assay wells or
reaction tubes as specified by the assay kit.
4. Perform washes, incubations, and reagent additions as detailed
in the assay kit’s protocol.
5. Utilize the ELISA plate reader or other appropriate detection
system to read results.
C. DATA ANALYSIS AND VALIDATION:
1. Inspect raw data for outliers, quality control (QC) validation, and
check that all control samples fall within acceptable ranges.
2. Analyze results according to the assay manufacturer's
guidelines.
3. Verify and interpret autoantibody presence and levels.
4. Any unusual or flagging results must be retested or deemed
appropriate prior to result validation.
5. QUALITY CONTROL:
A robust quality control process ensures the accuracy and precision
of test results.
1. Run positive and negative controls with each assay batch.
2. Include internal QC samples in each batch to monitor assay
performance.
3. Record all control and sample data in a log for tracking and
troubleshooting.
4. APPROVAL AND REPORTING:
5. Once results have been reviewed and validated, input data into
the laboratory information management system (LIS).
6. Generate the final report and ensure it meets the clinic’s or
physician’s specific requirements before release.
7. Communicate any critical or unusual findings directly to the
requesting physician or authorized personnel.
8. LIMITATIONS:
Refer to the assay kit’s product insert for specific limitations regarding
the reactivity, specificity, and sensitivity of the tests used.

By adopting the detailed steps outlined in this SOP, the laboratory
ensures that the analytical phase for axonal neuropathy,
autoimmune/paraneoplastic evaluation, serum is conducted in a
reliable, consistent, and compliant manner.
