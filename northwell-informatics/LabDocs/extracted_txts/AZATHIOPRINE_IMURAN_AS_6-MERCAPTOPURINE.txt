Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Azathioprine (Imuran) as 6-
Mercaptopurine
1. PURPOSE To establish a standardized procedure for the
quantitative determination of 6-mercaptopurine levels from
azathioprine (Imuran) therapy using high-performance liquid
chromatography (HPLC) or other validated analytical methods. This
protocol ensures accuracy, precision, and reproducibility of results to
support clinical management of patients on azathioprine therapy.
2. SCOPE This procedure applies to all laboratory technicians,
technologists, and analysts conducting the analysis of 6-
mercaptopurine in patient plasma or serum samples using validated
methods.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Laboratory Technicians: Preparation of reagents, sample
processing, and initial setup of equipment.
• Laboratory Analysts: Conducting the analysis, ensuring proper
calibration of equipment, and preliminary data review.
• Supervisors/Designated Staff: Validation of results,
troubleshooting, and ensuring compliance with quality standards.
4. SPECIMEN HANDLING
• Specimen Type: Plasma or serum.
• Collection Device: Blood should be collected in a heparinized or
EDTA tube.
• Volume: 3-5 mL of whole blood.
• Processing: Centrifuge the collected blood at 1500 x g for 10
minutes at 4°C to obtain plasma or serum.
• Storage: Extracted plasma/serum should be stored at -20°C if not
analyzed immediately. Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
5. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• HPLC system with UV detector or other validated system
• Analytical columns suitable for 6-mercaptopurine
• Mobile phase: appropriate buffer, organic solvents (usually
methanol or acetonitrile), and water
• Internal standard (if applicable)
• 6-mercaptopurine standard for calibration curve
• Sample preparation materials: pipettes, centrifuge tubes, vortex
mixer, centrifuge
6. PROCEDURE
6.1. Preparation a. Prepare the mobile phase according to the
validated method specification. b. Degas the mobile phase using a
vacuum pump or helium sparging. c. Prepare standard solutions of 6-
mercaptopurine at known concentrations for calibration. d. Prepare
quality control (QC) samples at low, medium, and high
concentrations. e. Equilibrate the HPLC column with the mobile
phase before analysis.
6.2. Sample Preparation a. Thaw frozen plasma/serum samples at
room temperature. b. Add an appropriate volume of the internal
standard to each sample (if applicable). c. Precipitate proteins by
adding a suitable volume of an organic solvent (e.g., methanol). d.
Vortex mix and centrifuge the samples at 3000 x g for 10 minutes. e.
Transfer the supernatant to a clean HPLC vial.
6.3. Sample Analysis a. Inject the calibration standards, QC
samples, and patient samples into the HPLC system. b. Monitor the
elution of 6-mercaptopurine at the appropriate wavelength using the
UV detector. c. Ensure that the retention time of the 6-
mercaptopurine peak in the patient samples matches that of the
standards.
6.4. Calibration and Quality Control a. Generate a calibration curve
by plotting peak area ratios (6-mercaptopurine/internal standard)
against the known concentrations. b. Calculate the concentration of
6-mercaptopurine in patient samples by interpolating from the
calibration curve. c. QC samples should fall within ±15% of their
nominal values for the run to be accepted.
7. RESULTS REPORTING a. Validate all results by verifying
calibration consistency, QC sample results, and by repeating any
questionable results. b. Report 6-mercaptopurine concentration in ng/
mL or µg/L, specifying the lower and upper limits of quantification. c.
Document the date, time, and initials of the analyst performing the
test.
8. QUALITY CONTROL AND TROUBLESHOOTING a. Perform
regular maintenance and calibration of the HPLC system. b.
Undertake method validation studies including precision, accuracy,
linearity, and recovery. c. Troubleshoot equipment or procedural
issues as per manufacturer guidelines. d. Cross-check results with
previous patient data (if available) to ensure consistency.
