1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to provide step-by-step instructions
for performing B-CATENIN mutation analysis using next-generation
sequencing (NGS) on tumor samples.
2. SCOPE
This protocol applies to the analysis of tumor samples for B-
CATENIN mutations using NGS technology in a CLIA-certified
laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the trained laboratory personnel to perform
the procedures outlined in this document accurately and efficiently.
Supervisors are responsible for ensuring that all personnel are
properly trained and all procedures are followed correctly.
4. DEFINITIONS
• B-CATENIN: A protein encoded by the CTNNB1 gene, mutations
of which are implicated in various cancers.
• Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS): A high-throughput
sequencing technology used to analyze genetic material.
5. PROCEDURE
5.1 Sample Preparation
5.1.1 Sample Requirements
• Tumor tissue samples, freshly frozen or formalin-fixed paraffin-
embedded (FFPE).
• Minimum DNA quantity: 50 ng
• DNA purity: A260/A280 ratio between 1.8 and 2.0
5.1.2 DNA Extraction
• Use designated DNA extraction kits following the manufacturer's
protocol.
• Quantify DNA using a Qubit fluorometer or spectrophotometer.
• Assess DNA quality using an Agilent Bioanalyzer or similar
instrument.
5.2 Library Preparation
5.2.1 Library Preparation Kit
• Use a validated library preparation kit specific for targeted
sequencing.
5.2.2 Library Preparation Steps
• Fragmentation: Fragment the DNA to the desired size
(approximately 200-300 bp) using a Covaris sonicator or
equivalent.
• End Repair: Perform end repair to create blunt ends.
• A-Tailing: Add an "A" nucleotide to the 3' ends of the DNA
fragments.
• Adapter Ligation: Ligate adapters to the DNA fragments.
• Cleanup: Perform cleanup using AMPure XP beads to remove
excess reagents.
• PCR Enrichment: Amplify the library using PCR (polymerase
chain reaction) following the recommended cycling conditions.
• Final Cleanup: Use AMPure XP beads to purify the amplified
library.
5.3 Library Quantification and Quality Control
• Quantify the library using a Qubit fluorometer or similar.
• Assess the library size distribution using an Agilent Bioanalyzer or
similar.
• Ensure the library concentration meets the minimum requirement
for sequencing (e.g., 4 nM).
5.4 Sequencing
5.4.1 Sequencer Preparation
• Calibrate and prepare the sequencer according to the
manufacturer's protocol.
• Load the purified library into the sequencer.
5.4.2 Sequencing Run
• Ensure proper sequencing parameters are set (such as read
length and depth).
• Initiate the sequencing run.
• Monitor the run for any issues.
5.5 Data Analysis
5.5.1 Data Generation
• Transfer the raw sequencing data from the sequencer to the
bioinformatics workstation.
5.5.2 Data QC
• Perform quality control checks on the raw sequencing data using
software such as FastQC.
• Filter and trim reads to remove low-quality bases and adapter
sequences.
5.5.3 Alignment and Variant Calling
• Align the filtered reads to a reference genome using alignment
software such as BWA-MEM.
• Perform variant calling using tools like GATK or VarScan to
identify B-CATENIN mutations.
5.5.4 Annotation and Interpretation
• Annotate identified mutations using tools such as ANNOVAR to
add functional information.
• Interpret the clinical relevance of mutations in the context of the
tumor type.
5.6 Reporting Results
5.6.1 Results Compilation
• Review the list of identified B-CATENIN mutations for accuracy.
• Generate a comprehensive report including the detected
mutations, their clinical significance, and recommended follow-up
actions.
5.6.2 Verification and Documentation
• Verify the results by a qualified laboratory professional.
• Document the entire analytical process and results in the
laboratory information system (LIS).
5.6.3 Communication of Results
• Communicate the verified results to the requesting physician or
healthcare provider.
• Ensure the report is added to the patient’s medical record.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
Routine quality control processes should be followed, including:
• Use of positive and negative control samples with each batch of
analyses.
• Participation in external proficiency testing as required.
• Regular calibration of all equipment and validation of processes.
7. REFERENCES
Pertinent references and manufacturer's guidelines should include:
• Manufacturer instructions for DNA extraction kits and library
preparation kits.
• Sequencer operation manuals.
• Bioinformatics tools documentation.
8. REVISION HISTORY
