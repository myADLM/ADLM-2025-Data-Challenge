Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) for B-Cell Acute
Lymphoblastic Leukemia/Lymphoma, Children's Oncology
Group Enrollment Testing, FISH Analysis
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this document is to outline the analytical procedures
for detecting specific genetic abnormalities in B-Cell Acute
Lymphoblastic Leukemia/Lymphoma (B-ALL) using Fluorescence In
Situ Hybridization (FISH) for Children's Oncology Group Enrollment
Testing. This ensures accurate, reliable, and timely reporting of
results to assist in clinical diagnosis and treatment planning.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
The responsibility for performing the procedures as outlined in this
SOP is assigned to trained laboratory personnel proficient in
molecular cytogenetic techniques, specifically in FISH analysis for B-
ALL.
1. DEFINITION
Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) is a cytogenetic technique
utilized to identify and localize the presence or absence of specific
DNA sequences on chromosomes. This test is crucial for detecting
genetic abnormalities associated with B-ALL.
1. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
• Fluorescence microscope
• Hybridization oven
• Incubator
• Centrifuge
• Thermocycler
• Water bath
1. REAGENTS AND CONSUMABLES
• FISH probes specific for B-ALL genetic abnormalities (e.g., ETV6-
RUNX1, BCR-ABL, etc.)
• Hybridization buffer
• DAPI counterstain
• Wash buffers
• Ethanol series for dehydration
• Immersion oil
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Bone marrow or peripheral blood specimen.
• Specimen should be delivered within the specified time frame and
properly labeled with patient identifiers.
• Specimen handling should be done aseptically to prevent any
contamination.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Slide Preparation
1. Prepare the specimen by creating cell suspensions from bone
marrow or peripheral blood.
2. Centrifuge the cell suspensions and resuspend the cell pellet in
an appropriate volume of hypotonic solution. Incubate the
suspension at room temperature for 20 minutes.
3. Fix the cell suspension by adding a fixative solution (3:1
methanol to acetic acid). Repeat fixation twice.
4. Drop the fixed cells onto clean microscope slides. Allow the
slides to dry overnight at room temperature.
B. Probe Application and Hybridization
1. Apply 10 μL of the prepared FISH probe to the target area of
each slide.
2. Cover the probe with a cover slip and seal with rubber cement.
3. Place the slides in a hybridization chamber and incubate
according to the manufacturer's instructions.
4. Denature the DNA at 75°C for 5 minutes in a hybridization
oven.
5. Hybridize for 16 hours at 37°C in a humidified chamber.
C. Post-Hybridization Washes
1. Remove cover slips carefully.
2. Perform a series of stringent wash steps using post-
hybridization buffer at 72°C.
3. Dehydrate the slides through a graded ethanol series (70%,
85%, 100%) and air dry.
D. Staining and Visualization
1. Counterstain the slides with DAPI and cover with a fresh cover
slip.
2. Visualize under a fluorescence microscope.
3. Capture images of metaphase spreads and interphase nuclei
using appropriate imaging software.
E. Scoring and Analysis
1. Score a minimum of 200 interphase nuclei and 20 metaphase
cells per probe set.
2. Document the presence of any genetic aberrations using
established laboratory criteria.
3. Interpret the results in conjunction with clinical and other
laboratory findings.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include appropriate positive and negative control slides in each
batch.
• Ensure that all reagents and probes are within their expiration
dates and properly stored.
• Perform and document regular maintenance and calibration of
equipment.
• Review each individual’s results by a second qualified
technologist or supervisor.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Record findings in the laboratory information system.
• Generate a detailed report including the percentage of cells with
observed genetic aberrations, probe sets used, and an
interpretation of the findings.
• Ensure timely communication of results to the referring clinician
and enrollment with the Children’s Oncology Group.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Establish specific reference intervals based on the prevalence of
genetic abnormalities in diagnosed B-ALL cases in the individual
laboratory setting.
• Consult updated guidelines and literature for any changes in
reference intervals and procedural updates.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Acknowledge potential limitations such as:
• Incomplete hybridization or weak signal intensity.
• Overlapping signals causing interpretation difficulties.
• Presence of artifacts mimicking signal patterns.
• Variability in sample quality affecting results.
