Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for B-Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia/
Lymphoma (ALL), FISH, Adult, Varies
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the analytical phase procedures for generating
results for B-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia/Lymphoma (ALL)
using Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) in adult patients. It
ensures accuracy, reproducibility, and quality control of test results.
Responsibility:
• It is the responsibility of designated staff to perform FISH testing
according to this SOP.
• All staff must ensure that all procedural steps are executed
correctly and promptly document any anomalies or deviations
during the process.
1. DEFINITION
Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) is a molecular cytogenetic
technique that uses fluorescent probes binding to specific
chromosome regions to identify genetic abnormalities associated with
B-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia/Lymphoma (ALL).
1. PROCEDURE
Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies:
• FISH probes specific to B-cell ALL markers
• Hybridization chamber
• Fluorescence microscope
• Cytogenetic grade slide water bath
• Denaturation solution (formamide-based)
• Hybridization solution
• Washing buffers
• Mounting medium
• Laboratory reagents (ethanol, PBS, etc.)
• Specimen slides (prepared from bone marrow or peripheral blood)
• Control slides (positive and negative controls)
Preparation:
Specimen Preparation:
1. Collect specimen: Ensure a valid bone marrow or peripheral
blood sample is collected, stored, and transported according to
laboratory protocols.
2. Slide Preparation: Prepare specimen slides and fix
appropriately.
3. Pretreatment: Perform pretreatment to remove proteins that
may interfere with hybridization (e.g., using pepsin).
Pre-Hybridization:
1. Dehydrate Specimen Slides: Pass slides through ethanol
series (70%, 85%, 100%) for dehydration.
2. Denaturation: Apply denaturation solution and incubate at
specified temperature and duration.
3. Apply Hybridization Solution: Add FISH probes to the pre-
warmed hybridization solution and apply to specimen and
control slides.
Hybridization:
1. Incubation: Place slides in hybridization chamber and incubate
at the recommended temperature overnight for optimal
hybridization of probes to targeted DNA sequences.
Post-Hybridization:
1. Washing: After hybridization, wash slides using specified buffer
solutions to remove excess probes and non-specifically bound
material.
2. Dehydrate: Dehydrate slides again through ethanol series.
Detection:
1. Counterstaining: Apply counterstain (such as DAPI) to
visualize all chromosomes and nuclei.
2. Mount: Mount slides using mounting medium to preserve
fluorescence and avoid drying out.
Analysis:
1. Imaging: Examine slides under fluorescence microscope.
Capture images of hybridized chromosomes/nuclei using image
capture software.
2. Interpretation: Analyze fluorescence signals. Identify and
document specific genetic abnormalities associated with B-cell
ALL according to established criteria.
3. Documentation: Document findings in LIS and record images
and results.
Quality Control:
1. Positive and Negative Controls: Include both positive and
negative control slides in each batch of testing to assure
accuracy of results.
2. Review: Review control results to validate test run.
3. Calibration: Ensure the fluorescence microscope and other
equipment are calibrated and functioning properly before
analysis.
Reporting Results:
1. Interpretation: Ensure all results are reviewed and interpreted
by a qualified technologist.
2. Verification: Data must be verified and documented in the LIS
by the technologist.
3. Critical Results: Report any critical results to the appropriate
clinical personnel per established laboratory policy.
4. REFERENCE INTERVALS: Refer to specific FISH reference
intervals established for B-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia/
Lymphoma markers on respective probe insert.
Method Limitations: Refer to FISH probe product insert for specific
limitations of the reagents and procedure.

Review and Updates: This protocol should be reviewed annually,
and updates should be made as per new guidelines, technology
advancements, and manufacturer's recommendations.
This SOP ensures the precision, reliability, and reproducibility of FISH
results for diagnosing and monitoring B-cell Acute Lymphoblastic
Leukemia/Lymphoma in adult patients, while adhering to the high
standards required in a clinical laboratory setting.
