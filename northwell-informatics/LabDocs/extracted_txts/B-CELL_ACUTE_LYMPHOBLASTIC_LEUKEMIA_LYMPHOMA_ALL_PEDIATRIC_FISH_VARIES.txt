Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Analytical Phase for
Generating Results for B-Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia/
Lymphoma (ALL) in Pediatric Patients Using Fluorescence In
Situ Hybridization (FISH)
1. PURPOSE
To outline procedures for generating accurate and reliable results for
the detection of B-Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia/Lymphoma
(ALL) in pediatric patients utilizing the Fluorescence In Situ
Hybridization (FISH) technique.
RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all trained laboratory personnel to perform
the procedures outlined in this protocol accurately and consistently.
Laboratory supervisors are responsible for ensuring strict adherence
to this procedure and quality control measures.
1. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel who perform FISH
assays for the identification of genetic abnormalities associated with
B-Cell ALL in pediatric samples.
1. SPECIMEN
• Specimen Type: Bone marrow, peripheral blood, other relevant
tissue samples
• Volume: Minimum of 1 to 3 mLs
• Storage Condition: Store samples at 2-8°C. Do not freeze.
• Time Limit: Process specimens within 48 hours of collection
Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies
• Fluorescence microscope
• Hybridization station
• Incubator
• Humidity chamber
• FISH probes specific for B-Cell ALL (e.g., TEL/AML1, BCR/ABL,
MLL rearrangements)
• Hybridization buffer
• Deionized water
• Fixative (methanol/acetic acid, 3:1)
• PBS (Phosphate Buffered Saline)
• Slides and cover slips
1. PROCEDURE
Slide Preparation
1. Centrifuge samples at 1,000 rpm for 10 minutes to pellet cells.
2. Remove supernatant and resuspend pellet in 5-10mL fixative
(methanol/acetic acid, 3:1). Allow to stand for 20 min.
3. Repeat the centrifugation and fixation steps twice.
4. Resuspend the fixed cells in a small volume of fixative and drop
onto a clean slide.
Denaturation and Hybridization
1. Pre-treat slides with 0.2M HCl for 20 minutes, rinse with PBS.
2. Incubate in 2X SSC at 75°C for 2 minutes, followed by ethanol
dehydration (70%, 80%, 95%, 100%).
3. Denature the probe and target DNA by applying hybridization
buffer containing the FISH probe to the slide and incubating at
74°C for 2 minutes.
4. Hybridize in a humidity chamber at 37°C for 16 hours.
Post-Hybridization Washing
1. Wash slides in 2X SSC/0.3% NP-40 at 72°C for 2 minutes.
2. Follow with a series of washes: 2X SSC at room temperature
for 2 min, and 2X SSC/0.1% NP-40 for 2 minutes.
3. Rinse briefly in deionized water and air dry the slides in the
dark.
Counterstaining and Visualization
1. Apply a counterstain such as DAPI to the slide and incubate for
5 minutes.
2. Mount a cover slip using an anti-fade mounting medium.
Microscopy Analysis
1. Analyze the slides under a fluorescence microscope with
appropriate filters.
2. Capture images and ensure a minimum of 200 interphase
nuclei are evaluated.
3. Identify and record the presence of any chromosomal
translocations or aberrations consistent with B-Cell ALL.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
• Ensure all reagents, probes, and equipment are functioning
correctly by performing regular maintenance and calibration
checks.
• Use known positive and negative control slides for hybridization
efficiency and specificity verification for each batch of patient
specimens processed.
• Review results from control slides before analyzing patient
samples.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Document the presence or absence of specific chromosomal
abnormalities.
• Include the percentage of abnormal cells and a descriptive
interpretation according to the probe used (e.g., t(12;21) TEL/
AML1).
• All results must be verified and counter-checked by a secondary
reviewer before final reporting.
1. REFERENCES
• National guidelines for the detection of B-Cell ALL using FISH
• Manufacturer's instructions for FISH probes and equipment
• Relevant scientific literature and clinical best practice guidelines
1. DOCUMENTATION
• Record all observations, including images and counts of positive
cells.
• Maintain all logs and records of specimen processing, equipment
calibrations, reagent lot numbers, and control runs.
NOTE: Any deviations from this protocol must be documented and
reported to the laboratory supervisor immediately.
All laboratory personnel must be trained and certified according to
lab-specific standards to ensure adherence to this SOP.
