STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE Title: Analytical Phase
Procedure for B-Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia/Lymphoma
(ALL), Specified FISH
1. PURPOSE This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) outlines
the analytical phase procedure for generating results for B-Cell
Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia/Lymphoma (ALL) using
Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH). This includes the
preparation, hybridization, and analysis of the sample to identify
specified genetic abnormalities and ensure accurate and
reliable results.
2. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Fluorescence microscope
• FISH probes specific to B-Cell ALL genetic markers
• Hybridization buffer
• DAPI counterstain (4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole)
• Humidified hybridization chamber
• Wash solution (e.g., 0.4x SSC/0.3% NP-40)
• Ethanol series for dehydration
• Coverslips and slides
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Immersion oil
• Gloves and laboratory coat
1. SPECIMEN The following specimens are acceptable for FISH
analysis:
• Bone marrow aspirate
• Peripheral blood
• Fresh or frozen tissue biopsy
Unacceptable specimens:
• Clotted blood or bone marrow
• Degraded or improperly stored specimens
1. PROCEDURE Preparation and Pretreatment: a. Prepare the
sample by making a single-cell suspension from fresh bone
marrow, peripheral blood, or tissue biopsy. b. Ensure sample
cells are fixed on a slide by either dropping cell suspension
onto a slide or using cytocentrifuge preparation. c. Place the
prepared slides in a humidified hybridization chamber.
Denaturation and Hybridization: a. Apply the FISH probe mixture
(probe-specific for genetic markers) to the sample slide. b. Co-
denature the sample and probe by heating the slide according to the
manufacturer's recommended conditions (usually at 75-80°C for 5
minutes). c. Hybridize the slide overnight at 37°C in a humidified
chamber.
Post-Hybridization Washes: a. Following hybridization, wash the
slides with the pre-warmed wash solution for 2 minutes at 72°C. b.
Rinse the slides briefly in the ethanol series (70%, 85%, 100%) and
air dry.
Counterstaining: a. Apply DAPI counterstain to the slides for
nuclear visualization. b. Cover the sample with a coverslip and seal
the edges with nail polish or a compatible sealing agent.
Microscopic Analysis: a. Using a fluorescence microscope,
visualize the hybridized signals specific for B-Cell ALL markers. b.
Capture and record images of 200 interphase nuclei per case to
ensure accurate scoring.
1. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS a. Each FISH signal pattern
should be interpreted according to established guidelines,
identifying normal and abnormal signal patterns specific to B-
Cell ALL. b. Compare the observed signals to known probe
patterns for the detection of genetic abnormalities such as
translocations, deletions, and copy number variations.
2. QUALITY CONTROL AND REPORTING Quality Control: a.
Run positive and negative control specimens with each batch to
ensure the accuracy and reliability of the assay. b. Review
control results before analyzing patient samples. Controls must
pass the specified criteria (e.g., >95% signal concordance).
Reporting Results: a. Document the observed signal patterns in the
laboratory information system (LIS). b. Provide a detailed report
including the genetic abnormalities detected, interpretation, and
clinical significance relevant to B-Cell ALL diagnosis. c. Ensure
results are reviewed and verified by a qualified technologist or a
supervisory personnel before releasing to the clinician.
1. REFERENCE RANGES/INTERPRETATION: The reference
ranges for FISH in B-Cell ALL depend on the specific genetic
abnormality being investigated. Expected results should be
categorized into:
• Positive: Presence of genetic abnormalities (e.g., BCR-ABL1
fusion, TEL-AML1 rearrangement).
• Negative: Absence of the specific genetic abnormalities targeted
by the FISH probes.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS: a. Interpretation of FISH results
should consider the limitations of the probe and hybridization
efficiency. b. Genetic abnormalities not targeted by the specific
probes used will not be detected. c. High background or
autofluorescence may interfere with signal interpretation.
