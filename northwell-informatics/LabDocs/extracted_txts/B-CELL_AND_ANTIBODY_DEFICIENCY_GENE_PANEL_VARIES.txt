STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase of Generating Results for B-Cell and
Antibody Deficiency Gene Panel, Varies
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for the analysis and generation of results for
the B-Cell and Antibody Deficiency Gene Panel, which involves next-
generation sequencing (NGS) for detecting genetic variants
associated with B-cell and antibody deficiencies.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all qualified laboratory personnel involved in the
analytical phase of the B-Cell and Antibody Deficiency Gene Panel
testing.
3. RESPONSIBILITIES
• Laboratory Technologist/Scientist: Responsible for performing
the sequencing run, data analysis, and initial result interpretation.
• Bioinformatics Specialist: Responsible for advanced data
analysis and annotation.
• Laboratory Supervisor/Manager: Responsible for reviewing and
approving the final report.
4. DEFINITIONS
• NGS: Next-Generation Sequencing, a method used to rapidly
sequence large amounts of DNA.
• FASTQ: A text-based format used to store both a nucleotide
sequence and its corresponding quality scores.
• VCF: Variant Call Format, a standard format for storing gene
sequence variations.
• BAM: Binary Alignment Map, a binary format for storing sequence
data.
• QC: Quality Control, a set of procedures intended to ensure that a
manufactured product or performed service adheres to a defined
set of quality criteria or meets the requirements of the client or
customer.
5. EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS
• NGS Sequencer (e.g., Illumina MiSeq)
• Pipettes and filter tips
• Thermal Cycler
• Reagents and consumables specific to the NGS platform
6. PROCEDURE
A. DNA Extraction and Quantification
1. Extract DNA from patient samples using a validated extraction
kit following the manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Measure DNA concentration and purity using a
spectrophotometer or fluorometric method.
3. Ensure DNA quality meets the specified criteria (e.g., A260/280
ratio between 1.8 and 2.0).
B. Library Preparation
1. Prepare DNA libraries using a validated library preparation kit.
2. Quantify and assess the quality of prepared libraries using a
fluorometer and/or Bioanalyzer.
3. Pool libraries to meet the required sequencing coverage.
C. Sequencing
1. Load the pooled library onto the NGS sequencer according to
the manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Start the sequencing run according to the software protocol.
3. Monitor the sequencing run for completion and any errors.
D. Data Analysis
1. Generate FASTQ files from the sequencer.
2. Perform initial quality control (QC) on the FASTQ files using
suitable QC software (e.g., FastQC).
3. Align sequence reads to the reference genome using an
alignment tool (e.g., BWA).
4. Convert the alignment file to BAM format and sort the BAM file.
5. Perform variant calling to generate a VCF file.
6. Annotate variants using a variant annotation tool (e.g.,
ANNOVAR).
E. Quality Control and Data Interpretation
1. Review alignment statistics and variant calling metrics to
ensure data quality.
2. Filter variants based on quality criteria (e.g., read depth, allele
frequency).
3. Interpret clinically relevant variants in the context of B-cell and
antibody deficiency.
F. Reporting
1. Compile results into a draft report including information on
detected variants, their clinical significance, and any relevant
literature references.
2. Present the draft report to a senior laboratory staff member for
review.
3. Generate the final report after review and approval.
4. Upload the report to the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
and notify the ordering physician.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run positive and negative controls with each batch of samples.
• Perform periodic calibration and maintenance of equipment per
manufacturer's guidelines.
• Document all quality control procedures and any deviations.
8. REFERENCES
• Refer to the manufacturer’s user manuals for extraction kits,
library preparation kits, and sequencing instruments.
• Current literature on B-cell and antibody deficiency guidelines.
9. REVISION HISTORY
• v1.0 – Initial release (January 2023)
• v2.0 – Revision for compliance with updated guidelines (October
2023)
