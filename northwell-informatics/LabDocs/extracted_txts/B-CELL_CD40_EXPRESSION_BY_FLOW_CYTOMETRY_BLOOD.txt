Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for B-Cell CD40 Expression by
Flow Cytometry, Blood
1. PURPOSE
To provide detailed guidelines for the analytical phase of generating
results for B-Cell CD40 Expression by Flow Cytometry, using whole
blood samples. This SOP ensures standardized, accurate, and
reliable results.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of trained laboratory personnel to perform and
document all steps outlined in this procedure. Supervisors are
responsible for overseeing the process and ensuring compliance with
this SOP.
1. SPECIMEN
Preferred/acceptable:
• Whole blood collected in EDTA tubes. Specimens should be
processed within 24 hours of collection. Unacceptable:
• Clotted samples or those received in inappropriate collection
tubes.
• Specimens received more than 24 hours post-collection.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Flow Cytometer (BD FACSCanto II, BD FACSCalibur, or similar)
CD40 (APC) antibody CD19 (FITC) antibody Flow buffer (BD
FACSFlow) Lysing solution (BD Pharm Lyse or equivalent) Control
antibodies (Isotype controls) Microcentrifuge Pipettes and tips 15 mL
conical tubes Ice
1. PROCEDURE
Preparation of Reagents:
• Prepare flow buffer as indicated by the manufacturer.
• Prepare lysing solution following the manufacturer's instructions.
Staining of Cells:
1. Label appropriate number of tubes for patient samples,
controls, and isotype controls.
2. Add 100 µL of whole blood to each labeled tube.
3. Add 10 µL of CD19 (FITC) antibody to each tube.
4. Add 10 µL of CD40 (APC) antibody to each tube.
5. For isotype control tubes, add appropriate isotype control
antibodies.
6. Gently vortex each tube and incubate for 30 minutes at room
temperature in the dark.
Lysis of Red Blood Cells:
1. After incubation, add 2 mL of lysing solution to each tube.
2. Incubate for 10 minutes at room temperature in the dark to lyse
red blood cells.
3. Centrifuge tubes at 500 x g for 5 minutes, and discard the
supernatant.
4. Wash cells twice by resuspending in 2 mL of flow buffer,
centrifuging at 500 x g for 5 minutes, and discarding the
supernatant each time.
Acquisition on Flow Cytometer:
1. Resuspend the cell pellet in 500 µL of flow buffer.
2. Transfer the resuspended cells to a flow cytometry tube.
3. Acquire at least 10,000 events in the lymphocyte gate on the
flow cytometer.
4. Set appropriate compensation controls using single-color
stained samples.
5. Run the samples, acquiring data for forward scatter, side
scatter, FITC (CD19), and APC (CD40).
Analysis:
1. Gate on the lymphocyte population based on forward and side
scatter.
2. Further gate on CD19+ B cells.
3. Analyze the expression of CD40 on CD19+ B cells.
4. Compare the CD40 expression to the isotype control to
determine the percentage of CD40+ B cells and the mean
fluorescence intensity (MFI).
5. QUALITY CONTROL
6. Run daily flow cytometry QC procedures to ensure the
instrument is operating correctly.
7. Include a known positive control and an isotype control in each
run.
8. Track and document instrument and reagent performance,
taking corrective actions if needed.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
10. Calculate and document the percentage of CD40+ B cells in the
CD19+ B cell population.
11. Record the MFI of CD40 expression.
12. Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
ensuring review and verification by the technologist.
13. Provide interpretive comments if needed, referencing
established reference ranges.
14. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Ensure proper sample handling to avoid degradation. High levels of
debris or incomplete lysis of red cells can interfere with analysis.
Compensate appropriately to differentiate between overlapping
fluorescence signals.

1. REVISION HISTORY
• Ensure all amendments to the SOP are documented with dates
and nature of changes.
This SOP is effective as of October 2023 and will be reviewed
annually or upon significant changes to protocols or equipment.
