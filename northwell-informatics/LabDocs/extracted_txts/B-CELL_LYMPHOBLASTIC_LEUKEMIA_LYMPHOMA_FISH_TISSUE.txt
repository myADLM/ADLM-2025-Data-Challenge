Standard Operating Procedure for B-Cell Lymphoblastic
Leukemia/Lymphoma, FISH, Tissue
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for the Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization
(FISH) analysis of tissue samples in cases suspected of B-Cell
Lymphoblastic Leukemia/Lymphoma (B-ALL).
RESPONSIBILITY:
• It is the responsibility of all trained laboratory personnel to follow
this procedure accurately to ensure reliable and accurate results.
• The laboratory supervisor is responsible for ensuring that
personnel are adequately trained and that the procedure is
adhered to.
1. MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT
• FISH probes specific for B-ALL, including but not limited to: TEL-
AML1 gene fusion, BCR-ABL fusion, MLL rearrangements.
• Fluorescent labeled DNA probes, buffers, and hybridization kits.
• Microscope slides and cover glasses.
• Hybridization chamber.
• Fluorescence microscope.
• Thermobrite or equivalent.
• Nuclease-free water.
• 70%, 85%, and 100% ethanol solutions.
• DAPI (4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) counterstain solution.
• Tissue sample (formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) or fresh
tissue).
• Pipettes and pipette tips.
• Incubator.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Acceptable Specimen:
• FFPE tissue blocks or fresh tissue stored in appropriate
conditions to preserve nucleic acids.
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Tissue samples that are not properly fixed or stored.
• Samples with insufficient viable cells for analysis.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Pre-Analytical Phase:
1. Specimen Preparation:
◦ Receive and log the tissue sample in the laboratory
information system (LIS).
◦ Section the tissue sample into 4-5 µm thick sections using a
microtome.
◦ Mount sections on charged microscope slides and air dry
overnight.
2. Fixation and Deparaffinization:
◦ Place tissue sections in a series of xylene baths (2x5
minutes).
◦ Rehydrate tissue sections in a series of ethanol baths
(100%, 85%, 70%, 2x5 minutes each).
◦ Rinse slides in nuclease-free water.
B. Analytical Phase:
1. Pre-treatment:
◦ Incubate slides in pre-treatment buffer (e.g., citrate buffer) at
95°C for 10 minutes.
◦ Rinse slides in nuclease-free water and air dry.
2. Denaturation and Hybridization:
◦ Apply DNA FISH probe to the target area of the tissue
section.
◦ Place a cover glass on the tissue section and seal edges
with rubber cement or equivalent.
◦ Denature the DNA by placing the slides in a pre-warmed
Thermobrite (or equivalent) set to 75°C for 5 minutes.
◦ Transfer the slides to a hybridization chamber and incubate
at 37°C for 16-20 hours.
3. Post-Hybridization Washes:
◦ Remove coverslips carefully.
◦ Wash slides in 2x SSC/0.3% NP-40 at room temperature for
2 minutes.
◦ Wash slides in 2x SSC/0.3% NP-40 at 72°C for 2 minutes.
◦ Rinse slides briefly in nuclease-free water.
4. Counterstaining:
◦ Apply DAPI counterstain to each slide and cover with a new
glass coverslip.
◦ Air dry slides in the dark.
C. Post-Analytical Phase:
1. Imaging and Analysis:
◦ Examine the slides using a fluorescence microscope with
appropriate filters for the fluorophores used.
◦ Capture images of relevant fields for analysis.
◦ Analyze the images for the presence or absence of
expected FISH signals indicating chromosomal
abnormalities.
◦ Record observations in the LIS.
2. Interpretation and Reporting:
◦ The pathologist reviews the FISH findings in context with
other clinical and laboratory data.
◦ Generate the interpretive report, including details of
observed chromosomal abnormalities and clinical
implications.
◦ Enter results into the laboratory information system (LIS)
and ensure they are communicated to the requesting
clinician promptly.
3. QUALITY CONTROL:
• Include positive and negative control slides with each batch of
patient samples.
• QC slides should demonstrate the expected hybridization patterns
for validation.
• Record all QC data and troubleshoot any deviations immediately
to resolve issues.
1. REFERENCES:
• Manufacturer’s guidelines for hybridization kits and DNA probes.
• Clinical guidelines and protocols for the diagnosis of B-Cell
Lymphoblastic Leukemia/Lymphoma.
• Current Literature on FISH techniques and interpretation.
7. SAFETY AND COMPLIANCE:
• Follow all biosafety and chemical safety protocols when handling
patient samples and reagents.
• Dispose of waste materials according to the laboratory’s waste
disposal protocols.
• Ensure compliance with CLIA, CAP, and other relevant regulatory
bodies.
This protocol ensures that the analytical phase for generating results
for B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia/Lymphoma, FISH, Tissue is
performed accurately, consistently, and safely, providing reliable
diagnostic information for clinical decision-making.
