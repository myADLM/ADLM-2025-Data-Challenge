Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) B-Cell Lymphoblastic
Leukemia Monitoring: Minimal Residual Disease Detection by Flow
Cytometry
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to provide a consistent and reliable
method for detecting minimal residual disease (MRD) in patients with
B-cell lymphoblastic leukemia using flow cytometry. The analysis
provides important clinical information regarding the disease status
and treatment efficacy.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing
the flow cytometry analysis, ensuring accurate and timely results.
• It is the responsibility of the laboratory supervisor to ensure the
procedure is followed correctly and to oversee any corrective
actions when necessary.
1. DEFINITION
Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) refers to the presence of leukemic
cells that remain in a patient after treatment and are below the
threshold of detection by standard morphological techniques. Flow
cytometry is a powerful technique used to detect these cells.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type:
◦ Bone marrow aspirates (preferred sample type for MRD)
◦ Peripheral blood samples (acceptable if bone marrow is not
available but less sensitive)
Collection and Handling:
◦ Collect specimens into heparinized vacutainers (dark green
top) or EDTA tubes immediately.
◦ Transport specimens to the laboratory within 24 hours of
collection. Ideally, specimens should be processed as soon
as possible upon arrival. Keep at room temperature or 4°C
for transport.
Unacceptable Specimens:
◦ Specimens received more than 24 hours post-collection
without proper storage.
◦ Specimens with visible clot formation or hemolysis.
◦ Specimens with improper labeling or missing key identifiers.
2. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
◦ Flow Cytometer (e.g., BD FACSCanto II, Beckman Coulter
CytoFLEX)
◦ Antibody panels specific to B-cell markers (e.g., CD10,
CD19, CD20, CD34, CD45, TdT, etc.)
◦ Fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies
◦ Lysis buffer for red blood cell removal
◦ Flow cytometry sheath fluid
◦ Calibrated pipettes and microcentrifuge tubes
◦ Personal protective equipment (PPE)
◦ Sample preparation workstation
3. PROCEDURE
Sample Preparation:
1. Verify the specimen labeling against the requisition form.
2. Transfer specimen from the collection tube to a labeled
microcentrifuge tube.
3. Add lysis buffer to remove red blood cells and incubate
according to manufacturer instructions.
4. Centrifuge at 500g for 5 minutes and carefully aspirate
supernatant.
5. Resuspend pellet in sheath fluid, adjust to appropriate
concentration.
Staining:
1. Prepare antibody panels specific to B-cell lymphoblastic
leukemia markers.
2. Add predetermined volumes of antibodies to the sample.
3. Incubate in the dark at room temperature for 15-30
minutes.
4. Wash cells with sheath fluid and centrifuge at 500g for 5
minutes.
5. Resuspend the pellet in sheath fluid for flow cytometric
analysis.
Data Acquisition:
1. Calibrate flow cytometer using calibration beads.
2. Set up the instrument according to protocol for B-cell
MRD detection, ensure FSC, SSC, and fluorescence
channels are optimized.
3. Acquire 100,000 to 1 million events per sample, gating on
B-cell populations (e.g., CD19+ cells).
4. Apply appropriate compensations and analyze the events
using specialized software (e.g., FlowJo, FCS Express).
4. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Run daily and monthly quality control checks using
standardized B-cell control cells to ensure instrument
performance.
◦ Ensure all reagents (antibodies, buffers) are within their
expiration dates.
◦ Perform multi-level quality control with control cells to
validate assay reproducibility.
◦ Document any deviations, corrective actions, and results in
quality logs.
5. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ Use dedicated laboratory information system (LIS) to record
acquired data.
◦ Generate and review histograms and dot plots for MRD
analysis.
◦ Comparing with reference intervals and thresholds ensures
precise MRD quantification.
◦ Verify results with secondary technologist review before
releasing.
◦ Communicate critical values to clinical team, documenting
calls and communications.
