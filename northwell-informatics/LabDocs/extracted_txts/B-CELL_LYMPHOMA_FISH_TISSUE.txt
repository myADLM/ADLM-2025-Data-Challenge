Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Generating Results for
B-Cell Lymphoma, FISH, Tissue
1. Title: B-Cell Lymphoma, FISH (Fluorescence In Situ
Hybridization), Tissue: Analytical Phase
2. Purpose: To describe the standard procedures for the detection of
genetic abnormalities associated with B-cell lymphoma using FISH
on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue samples. This
SOP ensures accurate and reliable results for diagnosis and patient
management.
3. Responsibility: All qualified laboratory personnel must follow this
SOP to ensure the integrity and accuracy of test results. The
laboratory supervisor ensures adherence to the protocol and
manages any corrective actions when deviations occur.
4. Specimen Requirements: The tissue sample must be formalin-
fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE). Each specimen must be
correctly labeled with the patient’s identification and accession
number.
5. Equipment and Reagents:
• Microscopes
• Water bath
• Hybridization/Incubation system
• Thermocycler
• UV light source
• High-stringency wash buffer
• Hybridization buffer
• Fluorescent-labeled DNA probes for B-cell lymphoma genetic
markers
• Mounting medium with DAPI (4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole)
• Ethanol series for dehydration
• Xylene
• Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)
• Coverslips and slides
6. Procedure:
A. Pre-Hybridization:
1. Deparaffinization:
◦ Place FFPE tissue sections on positively charged slides.
◦ Deparaffinize slides in xylene for 2 x 10 minutes.
◦ Rehydrate through a series of ethanol washes (100%, 95%,
70%, 50%, water).
2. Antigen Retrieval:
◦ Immerse slides in an appropriate antigen retrieval solution.
◦ Heat slides in a water bath or microwave as per
manufacturer’s instructions (typically around 95°C for 20-40
minutes).
3. Washing:
◦ Wash slides in PBS for 5 minutes.
◦ Air dry.
B. Hybridization:
1. Preparation:
◦ Apply the appropriate DNA probe directly onto each tissue
section.
◦ Cover probe and tissue with a coverslip and seal the edges
with rubber cement or nail polish.
2. Denaturation:
◦ Place slides on a thermocycler set to denature the DNA
(generally 80°C for 5-8 minutes).
3. Hybridization:
◦ Transfer slides to an incubator at 37°C and incubate
overnight in a humid chamber to allow probe hybridization.
C. Post-Hybridization:
1. Washing:
◦ Carefully remove the coverslips from slides.
◦ Wash slides in pre-warmed high-stringency wash buffer at
72°C for 2 minutes.
◦ Wash again in PBS for 2 minutes at room temperature.
2. Counterstain:
◦ Apply DAPI mounting medium to each tissue section.
◦ Cover with a fresh coverslip.
D. Analysis:
1. Visualization:
◦ Examine slides under a fluorescence microscope.
◦ Use appropriate filters to visualize the specific fluorophores.
2. Scoring:
◦ Count at least 100 interphase nuclei for the presence,
absence, or abnormalities of expected fluorescent signals.
◦ Verify that the signals are within the correct nuclear regions
and score accordingly.
E. Quality Control:
1. Controls:
◦ Run known positive and negative control tissue samples
with each batch of patient samples.
◦ Ensure expected signals are accurately detected in control
samples before patient sample analysis.
2. Repeat Analysis:
◦ If control samples fail, do not report patient results.
◦ Repeat entire assay, ensuring to troubleshoot and resolve
any failures observed.
7. Reporting Results:
• Document findings clearly, ensuring each sample's result is linked
to the respective patient identifier.
• Include the percentage of nuclei with abnormal signals.
• Confirm results following the laboratory's reporting guidelines for
B-cell lymphoma FISH testing.
8. Interpretation and Limitations:
• Provide a precise correlation with clinical findings and other
diagnostic tests.
• Be aware that certain technical issues or tissue artifacts may
hinder the accuracy of results.
9. Documentation:
• Maintain all procedural records, equipment maintenance logs, and
quality control results.
• Follow laboratory procedures for result entry into the laboratory
information system (LIS) and verification by a qualified
technologist.
10. References:
• Include all manufacturer guidelines for reagents and equipment
used.
• Follow CLIA requirements and other relevant regulatory standards
for laboratory diagnostics.
By adhering to this protocol, laboratory personnel ensure accurate
and reliable results for diagnosing B-cell lymphoma through FISH
analysis on tissue specimens.
