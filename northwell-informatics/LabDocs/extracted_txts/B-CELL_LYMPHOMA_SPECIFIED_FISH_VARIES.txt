Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of B-
Cell Lymphoma, Specified FISH (Fluorescence In Situ
Hybridization) Testing
1. PURPOSE
To establish a standardized and validated method for the detection of
specific genetic abnormalities in B-cell lymphoma using Fluorescence
In Situ Hybridization (FISH). This protocol outlines the procedures
starting from sample preparation through to the analysis and
reporting of FISH results.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel performing FISH testing
on specimens received for B-cell lymphoma. The procedure includes
chromosome preparation, hybridization, detection, and result
documentation.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of trained laboratory personnel to perform FISH
analysis accurately and reliably according to this SOP. Supervisors
must ensure that personnel are trained, quality controls are in place,
and any deviations are documented and corrected.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND MATERIALS
• Fluorescent microscope
• FISH probes specific to B-cell lymphoma targets (e.g., MYC,
BCL2, BCL6)
• Hybridization buffer
• Pretreatment solutions (e.g., Protease, Formamide)
• Denaturation solutions
• Post-hybridization wash buffers
• DAPI counterstain
• Slides and coverslips
• Water bath
• Incubator
• Microscope slides
• Fluorescence detector and camera
5. PROCEDURE
A. Slide Preparation
1. Tissue Sample: a. Obtain paraffin-embedded, formalin-fixed
tissue sections (4-5μm thick). b. Place sections on positively
charged microscope slides. c. Bake slides at 56°C for at least 2
hours to overnight.
2. De-paraffinization and Rehydration: a. De-paraffinize slides with
xylene for 3x5 minutes. b. Rehydrate in graded ethanol
solutions (100%, 95%, and 70% ethanol) for 2 minutes each. c.
Rinse in distilled water.
3. Pretreatment: a. Place slides in pre-warmed pretreatment
solution at 37°C for 10 minutes. b. Rinse slides in distilled
water. c. Immerse slides in pre-warmed protease solution at
37°C for 10 minutes. d. Rinse slides in distilled water and air
dry.
B. Denaturation and Hybridization
1. Mix FISH probe with hybridization buffer according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Apply probe mixture to the target area of the slide and cover
with a coverslip. Seal edges with rubber cement.
3. Co-denature the slide and probe at 72°C for 2 minutes on a
heating block or water bath.
4. Hybridize overnight at 37°C in a humidified chamber.
C. Post-Hybridization Washes
1. Remove coverslip carefully without disturbing the tissue
section.
2. Wash slides in post-hybridization buffer at 72°C for 2 minutes.
3. Rinse slides in room temperature buffer for 2 minutes.
4. Air-dry and apply DAPI counterstain.
D. Analysis
1. Use a fluorescence microscope equipped with appropriate
filters.
2. Analyze at least 100 nuclei for each sample.
3. Record the number of positive and negative cells, noting the
pattern and intensity of the fluorescence.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run a positive and negative control sample with each batch.
• Ensure probe specificity and sensitivity by evaluating known cell
line samples.
• Document any deviations or issues encountered during the
procedure and their resolutions.
7. DOCUMENTATION AND REPORTING
1. Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
2. Review and verify results by a qualified technologist.
3. A pathologist or qualified professional interprets and finalizes
the report.
4. Include the following in the report: a. Patient identification and
demographics. b. Test indication and sample type. c. Detailed
findings, including percentage of positive cells. d. Interpretive
comments and clinical relevance.

• Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines for
FISH procedures.
• Manufacturer's instructions for FISH probes and reagents.
By following this SOP, the laboratory ensures consistent, accurate,
and reliable FISH analysis for B-cell lymphoma diagnosis and
prognostic evaluation.
9. REVISION HISTORY
The SOP must be reviewed annually or upon changes to procedures
or equipment.
