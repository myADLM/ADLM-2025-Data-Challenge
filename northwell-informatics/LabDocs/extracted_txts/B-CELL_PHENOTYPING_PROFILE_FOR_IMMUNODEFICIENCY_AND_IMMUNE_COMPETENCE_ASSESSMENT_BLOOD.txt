Standard Operating Procedure
B-Cell Phenotyping Profile for Immunodeficiency and Immune
Competence Assessment, Blood
1. Purpose
To outline the procedure for performing B-Cell phenotyping for the
assessment of immunodeficiency and immune competence using
flow cytometry.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory personnel trained in flow cytometry
techniques are responsible for conducting the procedure.
• Laboratory supervisors are responsible for ensuring the accuracy
and precision of results by overseeing the process and performing
regular quality control checks.
2. Specimen Requirements and Stability
• Preferred Specimen: Fresh whole blood collected into EDTA
(lavender top) tubes.
• Volume: Minimum volume of 3 ml.
• Stability: Specimen must be processed within 24 hours of
collection. If delayed, store at 2-8°C and process within 48 hours
to ensure cell viability.
3. Reagents and Equipment
• Reagents:
◦ Flow cytometry staining buffer (e.g., PBS with 1% BSA)
◦ Fluorochrome-conjugated monoclonal antibodies specific to B-
cell markers (e.g., CD19, CD20, CD27, CD38, IgD, IgM)
◦ Red blood cell (RBC) lysis buffer
◦ Flow cytometry sheath fluid
◦ Appropriate isotype controls
• Equipment:
◦ Flow cytometer (e.g., BD FACSCanto, Beckman Coulter
Navios)
◦ Centrifuge
◦ Vortex mixer
◦ Micropipettes and tips
◦ Chill rack or ice
◦ Timer
◦ Personal protective equipment (PPE)
4. Procedure
4.1 Pre-Analytical Steps
1. Specimen Check:
◦ Verify specimen identity, collection time, and volume.
◦ Inspect for clots or hemolysis.
2. Labeling:
◦ Properly label all sample tubes and reagent tubes with
appropriate identifiers.
4.2 Analytical Steps
1. Cell Preparation: 1.1. Aliquot 100 µl of whole blood into each
labeled sample tube. 1.2. Add the appropriate volume of
fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies to each tube according to
the manufacturer’s recommendations. 1.3. Vortex gently to mix
and incubate for 15-30 minutes at room temperature in the
dark.
2. RBC Lysis and Washing: 2.1. Add 2-3 ml of RBC lysis buffer
to each tube and incubate for 10 minutes at room temperature.
2.2. Centrifuge at 500 x g for 5 minutes. Discard the
supernatant. 2.3. Wash cells with 2 ml of flow cytometry
staining buffer. Centrifuge and discard the supernatant. Repeat
wash once more.
3. Resuspension: 3.1. Resuspend the cell pellet in 300 µl of flow
cytometry staining buffer and transfer to flow cytometry tubes.
3.2. Keep the tubes on ice until ready for analysis.
4.3 Flow Cytometry Analysis
1. Instrument Calibration:
◦ Perform daily calibration and quality control checks using
appropriate calibration beads as per manufacturer’s
instructions.
2. Sample Acquisition:
◦ Acquire fluorescence data using flow cytometry. Set up the
instrument to acquire at least 10,000 events per sample.
3. Gating Strategy:
◦ Create a lymphocyte gate based on forward and side scatter
properties.
◦ Use single-stained controls to set compensation for each
fluorochrome.
◦ Apply appropriate gating strategy to identify B-cell subsets
(e.g., naïve B cells, memory B cells) based on marker
expression (e.g., CD19+CD27+, CD38+).
5. Data Analysis and Reporting
1. Data Analysis:
◦ Analyze data using flow cytometry analysis software (e.g.,
FlowJo, FCS Express).
◦ Calculate the percentage of B-cell subsets relative to the
total lymphocyte population.
◦ Record and interpret the results in the context of clinical
question.
2. Quality Control:
◦ Run internal quality controls with each batch of samples and
verify results.
◦ Document any deviations and corrective actions taken.
3. Reporting:
◦ Prepare a detailed report with quantitative results for each
B-cell subset.
◦ Include method limitations and any relevant comments on
sample integrity.
6. Quality Assurance
• Implement and adhere to routine internal and external quality
assurance programs.
• Review analytical data regularly to ensure consistency and
accuracy.
7. References
• Manufacturer’s protocols for flow cytometry reagents
• Current literature on B-cell immunophenotyping for
immunodeficiency and immune competence assessment.
8. Documentation
• Maintain proper documentation of all specimen handling, analytic
steps, quality controls, and results in the laboratory information
system (LIS).
