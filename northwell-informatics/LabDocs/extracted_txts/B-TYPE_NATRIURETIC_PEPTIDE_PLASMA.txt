Standard Operating Procedure for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for B-Type Natriuretic Peptide (BNP), Plasma
1. PURPOSE This procedure outlines the standard operating
procedure for the analysis and reporting of B-type natriuretic peptide
(BNP) levels in plasma samples in the laboratory.
Responsibility: It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory
staff to follow this procedure to ensure accurate and reliable results.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Preferred Specimen:
• 3-5 mL of venous blood drawn into an EDTA (lavender top) tube.
Stability:
• Plasma samples must be separated from cells within 2 hours of
collection.
• Plasma may be stored at 2-8°C for up to 24 hours before
analysis.
• For long-term storage, plasma samples should be frozen at -20°C
or lower and are stable for up to 6 months.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Samples that have been hemolyzed.
• Samples collected in inappropriate collection tubes or with
incorrect anticoagulants.
• Samples that have been improperly stored or transported.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Centrifuge
• Automated immunoassay analyzer
• Pipettes and tips
• Vortex mixer
Reagents:
• BNP reagent kit (specific to the analyzer in use)
• Calibrators and controls provided with the BNP reagent kit
• EDTA plasma sample
Supplies:
• Secondary sample tubes
• Labels
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
4. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation:
1. Centrifuge the EDTA tubes at 1500-2000xg for 10-15 minutes at
4°C to separate plasma from cells.
2. Carefully transfer the plasma into a labeled secondary sample
tube without disturbing the cell layer.
3. If analysis is not immediate, store the plasma at 2-8°C for up to
24 hours or freeze at -20°C for longer storage.
B. Analyzer Setup:
1. Turn on the automated immunoassay analyzer and allow it to
warm up as per the manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Ensure that the BNP reagent kit, calibrators, and controls have
been brought to room temperature if stored refrigerated.
3. Load the BNP reagents, calibrators, and controls onto the
analyzer as instructed by the manufacturer’s protocol.
C. Calibration and Quality Control:
1. Perform calibration of the analyzer using the provided
calibrators according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Run quality control checks using both high and low control
materials to verify the calibration validity. Ensure that the control
results fall within the acceptable range. Document all QC
results.
D. Sample Processing:
1. Load the prepared plasma samples onto the automated
immunoassay analyzer.
2. Enter patient sample identification numbers accurately into the
analyzer system.
3. Commence the analysis. Monitor the analyzer to ensure proper
function throughout the run.
5. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Upon completion of the analysis, review the results for any
errors flagged by the analyzer.
2. Validate the results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
by comparing them with control and calibrator data.
3. Transfer valid patient results from the analyzer to the LIS for
electronic reporting.
4. In case of aberrant results, consider rerunning the sample or
conducting additional investigations before reporting.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Include chart checks and reviews to confirm that all QC data
meet established requirements.
2. Document and resolve any non-conformances as per lab
protocols.
7. REFERENCE INTERVALS Reference intervals must be consulted
from the reagent inserts or established laboratory-specific ranges
based on validated data.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS Refer to the BNP reagent kit instructions
for any potential interferences or limitations specific to the assay.
9. SAFETY PRECAUTIONS Standard Precautions: Follow standard
precautions and wear appropriate PPE when handling biological
specimens and operating laboratory instruments.
