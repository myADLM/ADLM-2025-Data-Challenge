SOP for Babesia microti IgG
Antibodies, Serum (Analytical
Phase)
1. Purpose
This SOP outlines the analytical phase procedures for determining
the presence of Babesia microti IgG antibodies in serum samples.
This is crucial for diagnosing Babesia infection which can inform
appropriate treatment protocols.
2. Scope
This procedure is applicable to all laboratory personnel performing
Babesia microti IgG antibodies tests in a CLIA-certified laboratory
setting.
3. Responsibility
It is the responsibility of all trained laboratory personnel to adhere to
this SOP. Supervisors must ensure compliance, review results for
accuracy, and sign off on final reports.
4. Specimen Requirements
Preferred Specimen:
• 1-2 mL serum obtained from a properly collected and processed
blood sample.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed or lipemic samples.
• Serum samples not properly aliquoted or those that have been
contaminated.
NOTE: Serum should be separated from cells within 2 hours of
collection.
5. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies
Equipment:
• Centrifuge
• Incubator
• ELISA reader
• Micropipettes
• Timer
Reagents:
• Babesia microti IgG ELISA kit
• Wash buffer (provided in the kit)
• Substrate solution (provided in the kit)
• Stop solution (provided in the kit)
Supplies:
• ELISA plates
• Pipette tips
• Calibrated serological pipettes
6. Calibration and Quality Control
• Perform calibration of ELISA reader as per manufacturer’s
instructions.
• Include positive and negative controls with each batch of tests.
• Use internal quality control sera for validation of assays.
7. Procedure
A) Preparation
1. Ensure all reagents and specimens are at room temperature
before use.
2. Label ELISA plates with patient and control identifiers.
B) Assay Procedure
1. Sample Addition:
◦ Add 100 µL of serum samples, positive control, and negative
control to appropriate wells.
◦ Incubate for 30 minutes at 37°C.
2. Washing:
◦ Wash wells 5 times with 300 µL of wash buffer.
◦ Ensure all liquid is removed from the wells after washing.
3. Addition of Conjugate:
◦ Add 100 µL of enzyme conjugate to each well.
◦ Incubate for 30 minutes at 37°C.
4. Washing:
◦ Wash wells 5 times with 300 µL of wash buffer.
5. Addition of Substrate:
◦ Add 100 µL of substrate solution to each well.
◦ Incubate for 15 minutes at room temperature in the dark.
6. Stopping the Reaction:
◦ Add 50 µL of stop solution to each well.
◦ Gently tap the plate to mix.
C) Reading Results
1. Read the optical density (OD) of each well using an ELISA
reader at 450 nm within 30 minutes of stopping the reaction.
8. Interpretation of Results
• Positive Result: Sample OD is greater than the positive control
OD, indicating the presence of Babesia microti IgG antibodies.
• Negative Result: Sample OD is less than the negative control
OD, indicating no detectable Babesia microti IgG antibodies.
• Equivocal Result: Sample OD falls between the negative and
positive control ODs. Repeat testing is recommended or consider
clinical correlation.
9. Reporting Results
• Record results directly into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
• Critical results must be immediately communicated to the clinician
and documented accordingly.
• Ensure proper documentation of control results and any
deviations.
10. Quality Control
A) Internal Controls:
• Positive and negative controls must be included with each run.
• Control failure requires investigation and resolution before
reporting patient results.
B) External Quality Assurance Proficiency:
• Participate in external proficiency testing programs periodically.
11. References
• Manufacturer’s instruction manual for Babesia microti IgG ELISA
kit.
• CLIA regulations for laboratory testing.
12. Document Control
• SOPs will be reviewed annually by the laboratory supervisor.
• Any updates or changes to the SOP will be documented and
implemented accordingly.
Laboratory personnel must ensure adherence to this SOP to maintain
accuracy and reliability in detecting Babesia microti IgG antibodies.
Proper training and compliance with all procedures outlined are
essential in delivering quality laboratory services.
