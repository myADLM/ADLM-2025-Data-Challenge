Standard Operating Procedure for Babesia species, Molecular
Detection, PCR, Blood
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the molecular detection of
Babesia species in blood samples using Polymerase Chain Reaction
(PCR). This ensures consistent, accurate, and timely results for
diagnostic purposes.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all personnel involved in the molecular
analysis of blood samples for the detection of Babesia species in the
laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
All personnel performing this procedure must be trained and deemed
competent in molecular techniques and PCR. It is the responsibility of
the laboratory supervisor to ensure compliance with this SOP.
4. DEFINITIONS
Babesia species: A genus of protozoan parasites that infect red
blood cells causing babesiosis. PCR: Polymerase Chain Reaction, a
molecular biology technique used to amplify specific DNA sequences.
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Whole blood.
• Collection Container: EDTA tube (lavender top).
• Volume: Minimum 3 mL.
• Specimen Stability: Keep refrigerated and transport to the
laboratory within 24 hours of collection.
6. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• DNA extraction kit (for blood samples).
• PCR reagents (including Taq polymerase, dNTPs, primers specific
to Babesia species, and nuclease-free water).
• PCR tubes and strip caps.
• Positive control (extracted DNA known to contain Babesia DNA).
• Negative control (nuclease-free water).
• Thermal cycler.
• Gel electrophoresis apparatus.
• Agarose gel, ethidium bromide (or alternative stain), and gel
loading dye.
7. EQUIPMENT
• Pipettes and sterile pipette tips.
• Centrifuge.
• Vortex mixer.
• Microcentrifuge.
• Thermal cycler for PCR.
• Gel electrophoresis system and power supply.
• UV transilluminator or gel documentation system.
8. PROCEDURE
A) DNA Extraction:
1. Label all reagents and tubes clearly.
2. Allow blood samples and all reagents to come to room
temperature.
3. Follow the manufacturer's protocol for the DNA extraction kit to
extract DNA from the blood sample.
4. Quantify and assess the quality of the extracted DNA using
spectrophotometry (optional).
5. Store DNA samples at -20°C until ready for PCR amplification.
B) PCR Setup:
1. Thaw all PCR reagents on ice and keep them on ice during
setup.
2. Prepare the PCR master mix according to the following recipe
for a total reaction volume of 25 µL per tube:
◦ 10x PCR buffer: 2.5 µL
◦ 25 mM MgCl2: 2.5 µL
◦ 10 mM dNTPs: 0.5 µL
◦ Forward primer (10 µM): 0.5 µL
◦ Reverse primer (10 µM): 0.5 µL
◦ Taq polymerase: 0.2 µL
◦ Template DNA: 2 µL (adjust volume if needed)
◦ Nuclease-free water: Adjust to 25 µL total reaction volume
3. Pipette the master mix into each PCR tube.
4. Add 2 µL of extracted DNA into the appropriate PCR tubes.
5. Include a positive control with known Babesia DNA and a
negative control with nuclease-free water.
6. Cap the tubes and briefly centrifuge to ensure all reagents are
at the bottom of the tube.
C) PCR Amplification:
1. Program the thermal cycler with the following cycling
conditions:
◦ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 5 minutes
◦ 35 cycles of:
▪ Denaturation: 95°C for 30 seconds
▪ Annealing: 58°C for 30 seconds (adjust based on primer
optimization)
▪ Extension: 72°C for 1 minute
◦ Final extension: 72°C for 10 minutes
2. Place the PCR tubes in the thermal cycler and run the program.
D) Gel Electrophoresis:
1. Prepare a 1.5% agarose gel with ethidium bromide or an
alternative nucleic acid stain.
2. Load 5 µL of PCR product mixed with loading dye into each well
of the gel.
3. Include a DNA ladder in one well.
4. Run the gel at 100V for approximately 60 minutes or until the
dye front has migrated an appropriate distance.
5. Visualize the bands using a UV transilluminator or gel
documentation system.
9. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
• A positive result is indicated by the presence of a band at the
expected size for Babesia DNA in comparison to the positive
control.
• A negative result is indicated by the absence of a band at the
expected size in comparison to the negative control.
• If the negative control shows any band or the positive control fails
to show a band, the results are inconclusive, and the PCR run
must be repeated.
10. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include positive and negative controls in each PCR run.
• Ensure all equipment is calibrated and maintained according to
the laboratory's quality assurance program.
• Periodically verify the performance of primers and reagents using
known positive and negative samples.
11. REPORTING RESULTS
• Record all findings in the laboratory information system (LIS).
• Report positive results to the requesting physician immediately.
• For negative results, ensure quality control criteria are met before
final reporting.
12. REFERENCES
• Refer to the manufacturer’s instructions for the DNA extraction kit
and PCR reagents.
• Guidelines for molecular testing in clinical laboratories.
13. RECORD KEEPING
Maintain detailed records of all specimens received, steps of the
procedure, controls used, and results obtained. Archive the PCR run
data and gel images for each test.
14. TROUBLESHOOTING
Consult the PCR troubleshooting guides for common issues such as
non-specific bands or no amplification. Repeat the PCR run if
controls do not perform as expected.
15. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS
• Always wear personal protective equipment (PPE) including
gloves, lab coat, and eye protection.
• Handle blood specimens and reagents according to biosafety
regulations.
• Dispose of waste materials, including gels and tips, in designated
biohazard containers.
By adhering to this SOP, the laboratory ensures accurate and reliable
detection of Babesia species in blood samples using PCR
technology.
