Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for
the Analytical Phase of Generating
Baclofen, Serum Results
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the procedures for the quantitative determination
of Baclofen levels in serum samples using High Performance Liquid
Chromatography (HPLC) with tandem mass spectrometry detection
(LC-MS/MS). The aim is to ensure consistent, reliable, and accurate
results for Baclofen analysis.

4. PROCEDURE
A. PREPARATION OF CALIBRATION STANDARDS AND QUALITY
CONTROLS
1. Prepare Baclofen calibration standards at concentrations
ranging from the assay's lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) to
upper limit of quantitation (ULOQ).
2. Prepare quality control (QC) samples at low, medium, and high
concentrations within the assay range.
3. Assign appropriate labels to all standards and controls.
B. SAMPLE PREPARATION
1. Thaw frozen serum samples at room temperature and mix by
gentle inversion or vortexing.
2. Centrifuge the serum samples at 3,000 RPM for 10 minutes to
remove any particulates.
3. Carefully transfer the supernatant to new labeled HPLC vials.
C. EXTRACTION PROCEDURE
1. Add a known volume of internal standard solution to all
calibration standards, QC samples, and serum samples.
2. Vortex mix all samples for 30 seconds to ensure thorough
mixing.
3. Place the samples in centrifuge and centrifuge at 3,000 RPM
for 10 minutes.
4. Transfer the supernatant to a fresh set of labeled HPLC vials for
analysis.
D. INSTRUMENTAL ANALYSIS
1. Program the HPLC system with the following conditions:
◦ Column: C18, 5µm, 4.6 x 150 mm
◦ Flow rate: 0.5 mL/min
◦ Injection volume: 20 µL
◦ Gradient elution profile using Mobile Phase A and Mobile
Phase B
2. Set the MS/MS system to detect Baclofen and internal standard
at their specific MRM transitions.
3. Load the prepared HPLC vials into the autosampler.
4. Run the HPLC-MS/MS analysis sequence including blanks,
calibration standards, QC samples, and patient serum samples.
5. Record the retention times and peak areas for Baclofen and
internal standard for each sample.
E. CALCULATION OF CONCENTRATIONS
1. Construct a calibration curve using the peak area ratio of
Baclofen to internal standard against the known concentrations
of the calibration standards.
2. Calculate the Baclofen concentration in each patient serum
sample using the calibration curve.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Run QC samples at the beginning and end of each analytical
batch, and after every 10 patient samples.
2. Ensure all QC results are within the acceptable range before
accepting patient results.
3. Document and investigate any deviations or QC failures,
including repeating the analysis if necessary.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Review all chromatographic data and ensure the integration
and quantitation are accurate.
2. Transmit the validated Baclofen concentration results to the
Laboratory Information System (LIS).
3. Verify and release the results in accordance with predetermined
reference intervals and acceptability criteria.
7. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Therapeutic Range: 80 - 400 ng/mL
• Toxic Range: > 1000 ng/mL
8. LIMITATIONS
• Sample hemolysis, lipemia, and icterus can interfere with
accurate quantification of Baclofen.
• Ensure thorough preparation and handling to avoid contamination
and carryover between samples.
9. DOCUMENTATION
• All results, quality control data, calibration data, and maintenance
records must be recorded and stored as per lab policy.
• Any deviations and corrective actions are to be clearly
documented in the lab notebook and reported to the lab
supervisor.
10. TROUBLESHOOTING
• In case of instrument errors, consult the instrument's manual and
proceed with the standard troubleshooting steps.
• If unresolved, contact the instrument manufacturer's technical
support.
