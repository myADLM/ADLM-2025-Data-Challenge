Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Bacterial Culture, Anaerobic, Various
Specimens
1. PURPOSE This procedure outlines the steps required to process
anaerobic bacterial cultures, identify the potential pathogenic
organisms, and generate accurate results for different specimen
types collected anaerobically.
2. SCOPE This SOP applies to laboratory personnel involved in the
analysis of anaerobic bacterial cultures within the microbiology
department.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Microbiology technologists are responsible for performing the
culture, identification, and susceptibility testing of anaerobic
bacteria according to this SOP.
• Senior technologists and laboratory supervisors are responsible
for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the testing
process, and for addressing any issues that may arise.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS Specimens that can be processed
for anaerobic culture include but are not limited to:
• Deep wound exudate
• Abscess contents
• Tissue biopsies
• Body fluids (e.g., pleural fluid, peritoneal fluid, etc.)
• Blood cultures (specific protocol for anaerobic blood cultures)
• Other sterile sites requiring anaerobic testing
Transport and Storage Conditions:
• Specimens should be transported in appropriate anaerobic
transport media.
• Specimens must be processed as soon as possible for optimal
recovery of anaerobes. If there is a delay, store specimens at
room temperature (20-25°C) and ensure they are processed
within 24 hours.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Anaerobic transport media
• Anaerobic culture media (e.g., anaerobic blood agar, Bacteroides
bile esculin agar, etc.)
• Anaerobic incubation jars or chambers
• GasPak anaerobic system or other anaerobic generation systems
• GasPak indicators
• Gram stain reagents
• Biochemical test kits and identification systems (e.g., API 20A)
• Incubator set to 35-37°C
• Vortex mixer
• Sterile pipettes and loop
6. PROCEDURE
6.1. Specimen Processing
1. Verify specimen identification and ensure correct labeling.
2. Prepare and set up the anaerobic chamber or jar with the
appropriate gas generation system and indicator.
3. Inoculate appropriate anaerobic media with the specimen using
sterile technique. Use a sterile loop or pipette to transfer the
specimen to the media:
◦ For fluid, tissue, or exudate specimens:
▪ Swab the specimen container with sterile saline before
inoculation if necessary.
▪ Plate onto anaerobic blood agar and other required
selective or differential anaerobic media.
◦ For solid tissue specimens:
▪ Mince or grind tissue in sterile saline before inoculation.
▪ Plate onto anaerobic blood agar and other required
selective or differential anaerobic media.
◦ For swab specimens:
▪ Directly roll and spread the swab onto anaerobic media.
4. Place inoculated media into the anaerobic chamber or jar.
5. Activate the GasPak or anaerobic generation system according
to the manufacturer’s instructions and confirm that the indicator
validates anaerobic conditions.
6. Incubate the media at 35-37°C for 48 hours.
6.2. Examination and Identification
1. After 48 hours, remove the culture plates from the anaerobic
chamber for initial reading.
2. Observe colony morphology, color, hemolysis, and other
pertinent characteristics.
3. Perform a Gram stain on representative colonies and examine
under the microscope for cellular morphology and arrangement.
4. Based on the preliminary identification from colony morphology
and Gram stain:
◦ Subculture or proceed with biochemical testing for further
identification.
◦ Utilize specific anaerobic identification panels (e.g., API
20A) as required.
5. Re-incubate plates for additional 24-48 hours if necessary to
ensure recovery of slow-growing anaerobes.
6.3. Susceptibility Testing
1. Perform antimicrobial susceptibility testing on isolated
anaerobic pathogens if required. Use standard protocols (e.g.,
CLSI guidelines) for testing methods such as broth
microdilution or E-test.
2. Record and interpret results according to standardized criteria.
6.4. Reporting Results
1. Document findings in the laboratory information system (LIS).
2. Include the identification of organisms, Gram stain results,
colony morphology description, and antibiotic susceptibility
profiles in the report.
3. Verify and sign off results by a senior technologist or
microbiologist.
4. Communicate critical results promptly to the appropriate
healthcare provider.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include quality control organisms with each batch of media or with
each new reagent lot.
• Verify anaerobic indicators to confirm the integrity of anaerobic
conditions.
• Regularly review and document quality control results,
maintaining records for review.
8. REFERENCES
• Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines
• Manufacturer’s instructions for anaerobic culture media and
identification systems
• Laboratory Quality Management System protocols
9. SAFETY
• Follow standard laboratory biosafety guidelines, including the use
of personal protective equipment (PPE).
• Contain and dispose of biohazardous materials according to
institutional safety protocols.
10. DOCUMENTATION
• Maintain records of specimen processing, Gram stain results,
identification and susceptibility results, and quality control checks.
• Ensure logs are completed with date, time, technician
identification, and any observations or deviations from protocol
noted.
