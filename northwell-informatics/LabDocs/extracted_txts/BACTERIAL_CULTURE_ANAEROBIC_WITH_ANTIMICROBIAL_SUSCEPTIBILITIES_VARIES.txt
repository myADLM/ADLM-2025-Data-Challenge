Standard Operating Procedure: Bacterial Culture, Anaerobic
with Antimicrobial Susceptibilities
1. PURPOSE: This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) details the
steps to be followed during the analytical phase of processing
Bacterial Culture, Anaerobic specimens and performing antimicrobial
susceptibility testing. This ensures reliable and accurate results for
the identification of anaerobic bacteria and their response to certain
antimicrobial agents.
2. RESPONSIBILITY: Designated laboratory staff, including
microbiologists and technologists, are responsible for performing the
analytical procedures as outlined in this document. It is the
responsibility of all staff to follow the procedures accurately and alert
a supervisor if any issues arise.
3. DEFINITIONS:
• Anaerobic Bacteria: Bacteria that grow in an oxygen-free
environment.
• Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (AST): Testing to
determine the susceptibility of bacteria to various antimicrobial
agents.
4. SPECIMEN HANDLING AND PROCESSING:
A. Specimen Reception:
1. Ensure that specimens are received in appropriate anaerobic
transport medium.
2. Check the specimen for proper labeling, including patient
information and collection time.
3. If the specimen is not acceptable, reject and notify the
appropriate personnel as per laboratory rejection protocols.
B. Specimen Processing:
1. Work in an anaerobic chamber or use an anaerobic gas-
generating system.
2. Inoculate the specimen onto suitable anaerobic culture media
such as:
◦ Anaerobic Blood Agar
◦ Bacteroides Bile Esculin (BBE) Agar
◦ Kanamycin-Vancomycin Laked Blood (KVLB) Agar
3. Incubate the inoculated plates at 35-37°C in an anaerobic
environment for 48-72 hours.
5. IDENTIFICATION OF ANAEROBIC BACTERIA:
1. Examine the plates for bacterial growth under appropriate
anaerobic conditions.
2. Perform Gram staining on isolated colonies.
3. Use biochemical testing (e.g., API 20A system, rapid ID32A, or
other appropriate commercial identification systems) to identify
the anaerobic bacteria.
4. Record colony morphology, hemolysis pattern, Gram stain
characteristics, and biochemical test results for proper
identification.
6. ANTIMICROBIAL SUSCEPTIBILITY TESTING (AST):
A. Disk Diffusion Method:
1. Standardize the inoculum concentration using a 0.5 McFarland
standard.
2. Swab the standardized bacterial suspension uniformly onto a
pre-reduced Brucella Blood Agar plate.
3. Place antimicrobial disks specifically for anaerobes (e.g.,
metronidazole, clindamycin, penicillin) onto the inoculated agar
surface.
4. Incubate the plates anaerobically at 35-37°C for 48 hours.
5. Measure and record the zone diameters of inhibition around
each disk.
B. Broth Microdilution Method:
1. Prepare bacterial suspension as per 0.5 McFarland standard.
2. Use commercially available anaerobic microdilution panels,
following manufacturer's instructions.
3. Inoculate tubes or wells, incubate under anaerobic conditions at
35-37°C for 48 hours.
4. Read and record the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs)
for each antimicrobial agent.
7. INTERPRETATION AND REPORTING OF RESULTS:
1. Interpret growth and AST results using Clinical and Laboratory
Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines.
2. Record organism identification and susceptibility results in the
Laboratory Information System (LIS).
3. Communicate critical results immediately to the requesting
clinician.
4. Include a comprehensive report that covers:
◦ Identification of the isolated anaerobic bacteria.
◦ List of effective and ineffective antimicrobial agents based
on AST results.
◦ Any additional commentary or interpretation, as appropriate.
8. QUALITY CONTROL:
1. Include positive and negative controls in all testing procedures.
2. Perform routine calibration and maintenance of anaerobic
chambers and testing equipment according to manufacturer's
instructions.
3. Internal quality control strains should be included with each
batch of tests to ensure accuracy.
4. Document all quality control procedures, including issues and
resolutions, in the laboratory log.
9. TROUBLESHOOTING:
In case of any irregularities in the procedures or results:
• Verify the working condition of the anaerobic environment.
• Recheck the inoculum preparation and incubation conditions.
• Repeat the test using freshly prepared media and reagents.
• Document the issue, investigation, and resolution.
