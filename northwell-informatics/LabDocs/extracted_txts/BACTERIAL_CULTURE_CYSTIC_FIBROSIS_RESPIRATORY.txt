Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase for Generating Results for Bacterial
Culture, Cystic Fibrosis, Respiratory
1. Purpose: This SOP describes the analytical procedures for
generating results from respiratory specimens for bacterial culture,
particularly for patients with Cystic Fibrosis (CF). The goal is to
ensure accurate identification and reporting of bacterial pathogens,
which are critical for effective treatment and management of
respiratory infections in CF patients.
2. Responsibility: All suitably trained clinical laboratory staff are
responsible for adhering to the procedures defined within this SOP.
They are responsible for performing the analysis, documenting
results, and initiating appropriate corrective actions when necessary.
Laboratory supervisors must ensure all staff are adequately trained
and that the protocols in this SOP are strictly followed.
3. Specimen Requirements: Specimens acceptable for bacterial
culture include:
• Sputum
• Tracheal aspirate
• Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid
• Bronchial washes or brushings
Specimen must be collected in sterile containers and transported to
the laboratory under appropriate conditions to maintain specimen
integrity.
4. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies:
• Incubators
• Blood agar plates (BAP)
• MacConkey agar plates (MAC)
• Chocolate agar plates (CAP)
• Mannitol salt agar (MSA)
• Sabouraud dextrose agar plates (SDA)
• Cysteine-lactose-electrolyte-deficient (CLED) agar (alternative to
MAC for CF)
• Antibiotic susceptibility testing discs
• Gram stain reagents and microscope
• Quality control bacterial strains
• Sterile loops and disposable inoculation sticks
• Sterile saline (0.85% NaCl)
5. Safety Precautions:
• Adhere to biosafety level 2 protocols.
• Use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE).
• Properly dispose of all biohazardous waste.
• Follow decontamination procedures for spills.
6. Procedure:
A. Initial Specimen Processing:
1. Specimen Reception:
◦ Verify specimen label and requisition form details.
◦ Log sample details (e.g., patient ID, specimen type,
collection time).
2. Macroscopic Examination:
◦ Assess the quality and quantity of specimen.
◦ Reject unsuitable specimens (e.g., insufficient volume,
excessive contamination).
3. Specimen Preparation:
◦ Homogenize thick specimens like sputum with a mucolytic
agent if required.
B. Culture and Incubation:
1. Inoculation:
◦ Use an appropriate sterile loop to streak specimens onto
culture media plates:
▪ BAP: Incubate at 35-37°C in 5% CO₂ for 18-24 hours.
▪ MAC/CLED: Incubate at 35-37°C for 18-24 hours.
▪ CAP: Incubate at 35-37°C in 5% CO₂ for 18-24 hours.
▪ MSA and SDA: As required based on clinical context.
2. Incubation:
◦ Place inoculated plates in incubators at specified conditions.
◦ Ensure plates are properly labelled for identification.
C. Examination and Identification:
1. Colony Examination:
◦ After incubation, examine culture plates for growth. Record
morphological characteristics and perform Gram staining
from representative colonies.
2. Identification:
◦ Use the following steps:
▪ Perform biochemical tests (e.g., oxidase, catalase).
▪ Utilize appropriate identification systems (e.g., MALDI-
TOF MS, API strips).
▪ Consider selective media and antibiotic indicators to
identify common CF respiratory pathogens (e.g.,
Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Burkholderia cepacia
complex).
3. Antibiotic Sensitivity Testing:
◦ Perform antibiotic susceptibility testing on significant isolates
using disc diffusion method or automated systems (e.g.,
Vitek).
◦ Follow Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI)
guidelines for interpretation.
D. Quality Control:
1. Quality Control Strains:
◦ Include appropriate quality control strains (e.g. E. coli ATCC
25922, P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853) in all testing batches.
◦ Record and validate QC results regularly.
2. Documentation:
◦ Ensure all results, QC, and corrective actions are
documented in appropriate logs and laboratory information
systems (LIS).
E. Reporting Results:
1. Review and Interpretation:
◦ Carefully review all culture, identification, and sensitivity
results.
◦ Enter results in the LIS for verification.
◦ Double-check for significant pathogens critical to CF
management.
2. Critical Values:
◦ Promptly communicate any critical results (e.g., significant
resistant organisms) to the requesting physician.
◦ Follow proper documentation and reporting protocols for
critical results.
7. Corrective Actions:
• Immediately handle out-of-specification conditions using
appropriate corrective measures:
◦ Address instrument malfunctions (refer to instrument manuals
or service teams).
◦ Repeat assays or QC checks as necessary.
8. References:
• CLSI guidelines on antimicrobial susceptibility testing (current
version).
• Manufacturer’s instructions for all equipment and reagents used.
• Laboratory safety protocols and infection control guidelines.
9. Review Cycle: This SOP will be reviewed and updated annually to
ensure compliance with current standards and practices.
