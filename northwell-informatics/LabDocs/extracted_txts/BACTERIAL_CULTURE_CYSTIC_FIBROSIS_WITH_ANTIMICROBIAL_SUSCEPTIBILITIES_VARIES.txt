Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for Bacterial Culture,
Cystic Fibrosis with Antimicrobial Susceptibilities
1. PURPOSE
To describe the protocol for processing and analyzing bacterial
cultures from cystic fibrosis (CF) patients in order to identify bacterial
pathogens and determine their antimicrobial susceptibilities.
Responsibility:
Medical laboratory scientists and technologists are responsible for
carrying out the procedures described in this SOP to ensure the
accurate identification of pathogens and reporting of antimicrobial
susceptibilities. Supervisors are responsible for monitoring
compliance with this SOP and ensuring all corrective actions are
taken as necessary.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Acceptable Specimens:
• Sputum specimens collected in sterile containers.
• Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) specimens.
• Throat swabs for CF patients unable to produce sputum, collected
in a bacterial transport medium.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens not labeled with patient identification.
• Specimens leaked or spilled in transport.
• Specimens collected >24 hours before processing if not properly
refrigerated or brought to laboratory within specific times.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Class II Biological Safety Cabinet.
• Incubators set at 35-37°C with CO2.
• Microscope.
• Inoculating loops and spreaders.
• Plates (e.g., Blood agar, MacConkey agar, Chocolate agar).
• VITEK or similar automated system for bacterial identification and
antimicrobial susceptibility testing.
Reagents and Supplies:
• Sterile saline solution.
• Gram stain reagents.
• Antibiotic discs for susceptibility testing.
• Quality control strains.
4. PROCEDURE
A) Specimen Handling and Processing:
1. Receiving Specimen:
◦ Verify the specimen matches the laboratory requisition form.
◦ Record date and time of receipt.
2. Macroscopic Examination:
◦ Inspect specimen for volume and quality. Reject specimen if
insufficient or inadequate.
3. Microscopic Examination:
◦ Prepare a Gram stain of the sample.
◦ Examine for the presence and types of bacteria and white
blood cells.
4. Culturing:
◦ Use sterile technique to inoculate specimens onto
appropriate culture media. Typical sets include:
▪ Blood agar
▪ MacConkey agar
▪ Chocolate agar
◦ Incubate plates at 35-37°C in a CO2 incubator.
5. Incubation:
◦ Incubate plates for 18-24 hours. Examine daily for up to 48
hours.
B) Bacterial Identification:
1. Examine Cultures:
◦ Look for colony morphology suggestive of CF pathogens
(e.g., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus,
Burkholderia cepacia complex).
2. Sub-culturing:
◦ Sub-culture suspicious colonies on appropriate media to
obtain pure isolates.
3. Identification:
◦ Utilize manual biochemical tests and/or an automated
identification system such as VITEK.
◦ Record identification results in the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
C) Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing:
1. Preparation:
◦ Use standardized inoculum equivalent to 0.5 McFarland
standard.
2. Inoculation:
◦ Use the broth microdilution method or automated
susceptibility testing per manufacturer’s instructions.
3. Incubation:
◦ Incubate according to standard protocols (typically 18-24
hours).
4. Interpretation:
◦ Interpret results according to the Clinical and Laboratory
Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines.
◦ Record minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) or
inhibition zone diameters.
D) Quality Control:
1. Control Strains:
◦ Run quality control strains alongside patient samples for
both identification and susceptibility testing.
2. Documentation:
◦ Record and monitor all QC results. If controls fall outside
acceptable range, troubleshoot per QC protocol and rerun
affected batches.
5. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Laboratory Information System:
◦ Enter all microbial identifications and susceptibility results
into the LIS.
2. Interpretation:
◦ Report organisms with clinical significance and their
susceptibilities.
◦ Include comments or notes as needed based on findings
and clinical relevance.
3. Critical Values:
◦ Notify the clinician immediately if any critical pathogen or
resistance pattern is identified (e.g., multidrug-resistant
organisms).
