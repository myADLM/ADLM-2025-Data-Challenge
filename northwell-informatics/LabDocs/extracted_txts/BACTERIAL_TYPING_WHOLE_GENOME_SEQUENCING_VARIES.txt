Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Bacterial Typing using
Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS)
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for bacterial typing using Whole Genome
Sequencing (WGS) to ensure accurate and reliable generation of
sequence-based bacterial profiles for epidemiological and clinical
purposes.
1. SCOPE
This procedure applies to the sequencing and analysis of bacterial
genomic DNA in a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments
(CLIA) certified laboratory. It covers the steps from DNA extraction to
data analysis and interpretation of results.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory scientists are responsible for performing WGS
and bacterial typing according to this SOP. It is the responsibility of
these individuals to ensure that all steps are meticulously followed
and documented. The supervisor is responsible for verifying that the
procedures are adhered to and for addressing any discrepancies.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
4.1 Acceptable Specimens
• Fresh bacterial cultures isolated and grown on appropriate agar
media.
• Cultures must be pure and evaluated under sterile conditions.
4.2 Unacceptable Specimens
• Mixed or contaminated bacterial cultures.
• Degraded or improperly stored samples.
1. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
• DNA extraction kits (e.g., Qiagen, Promega).
• Spectrophotometer/Fluorometer (for DNA quantification) (e.g.,
Nanodrop, Qubit).
• Thermal Cycler (for library preparation).
• High-throughput Sequencer (e.g., Illumina MiSeq, NovaSeq).
• Bioinformatics software and computational resources (e.g., CLC
Genomics Workbench, Galaxy).
1. PROCEDURE
6.1 DNA Extraction
• Extract genomic DNA from bacterial cultures using a commercially
available DNA extraction kit according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
• Quantify and assess the purity of the extracted DNA using a
spectrophotometer or a fluorometer. Acceptable purity ranges for
absorbance ratios (A260/A280) are between 1.8-2.0.
6.2 Library Preparation
• Prepare sequencing libraries using a library preparation kit
compatible with the selected high-throughput sequencer.
• Follow the manufacturer’s recommended protocol to ensure
optimal library construction.
• Quantify and normalize libraries and pool multiple samples as per
the sequencer capacity.
6.3 Whole Genome Sequencing
• Load prepared libraries into the sequencer following the
manufacturer's protocol.
• Run WGS on the specified sequencer (e.g., Illumina MiSeq,
NovaSeq).
• Ensure quality controls are in place, including internal controls, to
monitor sequencing performance.
6.4 Data Analysis
• Use bioinformatics tools to process raw sequence data, including
quality assessment, trimming, and filtering of reads.
• Assemble genomes using user-verified pipeline e.g., SPAdes,
Velvet.
• Perform variant calling and bacterial typing using tools e.g.,
Prokka for annotation, MLST for sequence typing, and BGCV for
clonal complex assignment.
• Validate data accuracy with quality metrics (e.g., read coverage,
assembly quality).
6.5 Interpretation of Results
• Compare results against reference databases for bacterial typing,
e.g., NCBI, PubMLST.
• Generate reports with identified bacterial types and relevant
epidemiological information.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include negative and positive extraction controls with each batch
of DNA extractions.
• Sequence known reference strains to verify sequencing and
analysis integrity.
• Perform routine verification of bioinformatics pipelines and
software tools to ensure up-to-date methodologies.
• Adhere to manufacturer’s guidelines for maintenance and
calibration of equipment.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Compile sequencing run data and bacterial typing results in an
accessible format.
• Review and verify results before final documentation.
• Report to the appropriate stakeholders with clinical and
epidemiological interpretations.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING
Inconsistent results or issues observed during the procedure should
be documented and the supervisor notified immediately. The
following checks should be considered:
• Verify DNA quality and concentration.
• Ensure proper sequence library preparation, adjust workflows as
needed.
• Re-run quality controls specific to software tools.
• Consult with bioinformatics team or sequencer technical support if
problems persist.

• Manufacturer’s Instructions for DNA extraction kits, sequencing
platforms, and library preparation kits.
• Current literature on bacterial typing and WGS data analysis.
• Bioinformatics tool manuals and user guides.
By following these steps, the laboratory ensures accurate and
reliable results for bacterial typing through Whole Genome
Sequencing, adding valuable data for clinical and epidemiological
research.
