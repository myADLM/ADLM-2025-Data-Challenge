Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Title: Analytical Phase
Procedures for Bacterial Vaginosis, Nucleic Acid Amplification,
Vaginal
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this SOP is to outline the steps and
responsibilities for performing the analytical phase for the
detection of bacterial vaginosis (BV) using nucleic acid
amplification techniques in vaginal specimens. The accurate,
timely, and reliable reporting of results is emphasized.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for
performing the nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) for bacterial
vaginosis, ensuring quality control, and reporting results in
accordance with this SOP. It is the duty of all staff to identify any
issues or deviations and bring them to the supervisor's attention.
1. DEFINITION Nucleic Acid Amplification Testing (NAAT) for
Bacterial Vaginosis: A molecular method used to detect and
quantify the presence of specific bacterial DNA or RNA
associated with BV in a vaginal sample.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY Preferred/
acceptable: Vaginal swabs collected and transported in a
nucleic acid stabilization medium. Unacceptable: Specimens
that are leaking, unlabeled, collected using improper
techniques, or those that have been stored or transported
improperly, leading to compromised sample integrity.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• PCR Thermal Cycler or Automated NAAT system
• DNA/RNA extraction kit
• Positive and negative controls
• PCR master mix, including primers and probes specific for BV-
associated bacteria
• Micropipettes and pipette tips
• Vortex mixer and centrifuge
• PCR tubes or plates
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run controls with each batch of samples tested (positive control,
negative control, and no-template control)
• Document and review control results before releasing patient
results.
• Discrepancies or out-of-range quality control results must be
investigated and resolved before proceeding.
1. PROCEDURE Step 1: Sample Preparation i) Properly label and
process the vaginal swab specimens upon arrival. ii) Vortex the
swab tube to ensure homogeneous sample suspension.
Step 2: Nucleic Acid Extraction i) Follow the manufacturer’s
instructions for the DNA/RNA extraction kit being used. ii) Ensure
proper handling and preparation of all reagents. iii) Aliquot the
extracted nucleic acid into PCR tubes or plates.
Step 3: PCR Setup i) Prepare the PCR master mix according to kit
manufacturer’s instructions, including primers, probes, and
nucleotides. ii) Dispense the master mix into each PCR tube or plate
well. iii) Add the extracted DNA/RNA samples to their respective PCR
tubes or wells. iv) Include the positive, negative, and no-template
controls in each run.
Step 4: Amplification and Detection i) Place the PCR tubes or plates
in the thermal cycler. ii) Start the PCR program as specified by the
assay manufacturer. iii) Ensure the thermal cycler or automated
NAAT system operates within the defined conditions.
Step 5: Result Analysis i) Upon completion of the PCR run, analyze
amplification data from the thermal cycler or automated system. ii)
The presence of BV-specific nucleic acid will be indicated by crossing
a predefined threshold cycle (Ct) value. iii) Compare sample results
with the positive and negative control results to confirm assay validity.
1. REPORTING RESULTS i) Verify, validate, and document the
assay quality control results before reporting patient results. ii)
Enter the validated results into the Laboratory Information
System (LIS). iii) Review and interpret the data based on
established Ct threshold values for positivity. iv) Report the
results in the LIS with appropriate comments or interpretation
as necessary. Results may be reported as "Positive for
Bacterial Vaginosis," "Negative for Bacterial Vaginosis" or
"Indeterminate - Please Retest."
2. SAMPLE INTEGRITY ASSESSMENT i) If there are indications
of sample degradation or contamination (e.g., multiple failed
tubes, inconsistent control results), consult the supervisor. ii) If
necessary, a small aliquot can be analyzed for potential
contamination or degradation issues.
3. CRITICAL RESULTS Critical or unexpected results must be
communicated promptly to the healthcare provider and properly
documented. Follow the laboratory’s policy on critical value
reporting.
4. METHOD LIMITATIONS Refer to the specific assay
manufacturer's insert for details on potential limitations,
interferences, and factors that might affect the accuracy of test
results.
