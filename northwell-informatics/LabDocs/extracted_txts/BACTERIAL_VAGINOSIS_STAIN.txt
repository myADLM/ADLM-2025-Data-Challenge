Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Bacterial Vaginosis Stain
Analysis
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the analysis of Bacterial
Vaginosis (BV) smears, ensuring accurate and reliable results. This
procedure identifies key bacterial morphotypes and determines the
presence of clue cells, which are indicative of BV.
Responsibility: It is the responsibility of designated laboratory
personnel to perform the BV stain analysis, interpret the results, and
document the findings accurately. Supervisors must ensure that all
personnel are trained and competent in the procedure.
1. DEFINITION
Bacterial Vaginosis is a condition characterized by an imbalance of
the vaginal microbiota, often resulting in the presence of clue cells
and changes in bacterial morphotypes.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Vaginal swab
• Collection Method: Swab must be collected using sterile
technique and placed into appropriate transport medium.
• Acceptable Conditions: Specimen must be received within 2
hours of collection.
• Unacceptable Conditions: Specimen received beyond the
acceptable time frame, or that show signs of contamination.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation of Smear
1. Label a clean microscope slide with the patient identifier.
2. Using a sterile loop, transfer the vaginal swab specimen onto
the microscope slide.
3. Spread the sample thinly to form an even smear.
4. Allow the smear to air dry completely.
B. Staining the Smear
1. Place the dried smear into the staining rack.
2. Apply the following stains sequentially: a. Crystal Violet - Stain
for 1 minute. Rinse with distilled water. b. Gram’s Iodine - Apply
for 1 minute. Rinse with distilled water. c. Decolorize with
alcohol - until the smear appears clear. Rinse with distilled
water. d. Safranin or Counterstain - Stain for 30 seconds. Rinse
with distilled water.
3. Allow the slide to air dry or use a blotting paper to gently dry the
slide.
C. Microscopic Examination
1. Use an oil immersion lens to examine the stained smear.
2. Identify and document morphotypes:
◦ Lactobacilli: Large gram-positive rods.
◦ Gardnerella and other morphotypes: Small gram-negative or
gram-variable rods.
◦ Clue cells: Epithelial cells covered with bacterial clusters.
3. Record the findings clearly in the patient’s report.
D. Interpretation
1. A diagnosis of BV is suggested by:
◦ Presence of clue cells (greater than 20% of epithelial cells).
◦ Predominance of non-lactobacilli morphotypes.
◦ Reduced or absent lactobacilli.
2. Documentation: Record all observed findings, including the
percentage of clue cells, types of bacteria present, and any
additional observations.
3. QUALITY CONTROL
A. Quality Control Slides
1. Prepare control slides using known positive and negative
specimens.
2. Ensure control slides are stained and analyzed with patient
specimens.
3. Document the results of control slides and validate the staining
protocol.
B. Equipment Maintenance
1. Ensure microscopes and staining equipment are regularly
calibrated and maintained.
2. Document maintenance activities and any corrective actions
taken.
3. REPORTING RESULTS
Refer to site-specific reporting guidelines for entering results into the
Laboratory Information System (LIS). Ensure all results are reviewed
and verified by the technologist prior to release.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Presence of greater than 20% clue cells in epithelial cells: Indicative
of BV.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to individual reagent inserts for limitations and troubleshooting
related to staining reagents.
1. REFERENCES
Utilize reputable sources and peer-reviewed articles related to BV
diagnostics for additional information and updates on the procedure.
By following this SOP, laboratory personnel ensure the accuracy and
reliability of bacterial vaginosis smear analysis, contributing to
improved patient diagnoses and care.
