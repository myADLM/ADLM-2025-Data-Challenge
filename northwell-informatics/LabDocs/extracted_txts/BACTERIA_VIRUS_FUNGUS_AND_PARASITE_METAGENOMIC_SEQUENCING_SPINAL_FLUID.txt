Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Metagenomic Sequencing of
Bacteria, Virus, Fungus, and Parasite in Spinal Fluid
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedures for performing
metagenomic sequencing to detect and identify bacteria, viruses,
fungi, and parasites in spinal fluid samples. This protocol ensures
consistency, accuracy, and reliability of results.
Responsibility: It is the responsibility of the designated clinical
laboratory staff to perform the procedures as described, report results
accurately, and document any issues promptly.
1. BACKGROUND
Metagenomic sequencing allows for the comprehensive and
unbiased detection of pathogenic microorganisms in clinical samples.
This technique is invaluable in diagnosing infections, especially when
traditional culture-based methods fail or are inconclusive.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Preparation
1. Specimen Collection and Handling
◦ Ensure the spinal fluid specimen has been collected,
received, and accessioned appropriately.
◦ Store the specimen at 2-8°C if immediate processing is not
possible.
◦ If longer storage is required, store the sample at -80°C to
preserve nucleic acids.
2. Nucleic Acid Extraction
◦ Label all tubes and reagents clearly with patient information
and date.
◦ Follow the manufacturer's instructions for the nucleic acid
extraction kit (e.g., QIAGEN QIAamp DNA/RNA Mini Kit).
◦ Ensure that appropriate positive and negative controls are
included in each batch extraction.
◦ Quantify the extracted nucleic acids using a Qubit
Fluorometer or NanoDrop Spectrophotometer.
◦ Assess the quality of the extracted nucleic acids via agarose
gel electrophoresis or Bioanalyzer to ensure integrity.
B. Library Preparation
1. Library Preparation for Sequencing
◦ Use a library preparation kit compatible with the sequencing
platform (e.g., NEBNext Ultra DNA Library Prep Kit for
Illumina).
◦ Follow the manufacturer’s instructions step-by-step to
prepare sequencing libraries.
◦ Include appropriate controls to detect potential
contamination or technical artifacts.
◦ Perform library quantification using Qubit and assess library
size distribution using a Bioanalyzer or TapeStation.
C. Sequencing
1. Loading Libraries onto the Sequencing Platform
◦ Sequence the prepared libraries using an Illumina
sequencing platform (e.g., MiSeq, NextSeq).
◦ Follow the platform-specific instructions for loading libraries
and setting up the sequencing run.
◦ Include an appropriate sequencing control in each run.
2. Data Generation
◦ Monitor the sequencing run to ensure it progresses as
expected.
◦ After completion, export raw sequencing data (FASTQ files)
for subsequent data analysis.
D. Bioinformatic Analysis
1. Preprocessing and Quality Control
◦ Use a quality control tool (e.g., FastQC) to assess the
quality of raw sequencing data.
◦ Trim sequencing adapters and low-quality bases using
Trimmomatic or Cutadapt.
2. Taxonomic Classification and Pathogen Identification
◦ Align the reads to a comprehensive microbial reference
database (e.g., Kraken2, Centrifuge).
◦ Perform taxonomic classification and identify potential
pathogens present in the sample.
◦ Confirm any identified pathogens using additional
bioinformatics tools or databases (e.g., BLAST, MEGAN).
3. Analytical Validation
◦ Validate the analysis by comparing the sequencing results
with known positive and negative controls.
◦ Document and interpret the findings in the context of clinical
relevance.
E. Reporting Results
1. Data Interpretation
◦ Interpret the metagenomic results considering the patient's
clinical context.
◦ Consult with clinical microbiologists or infectious disease
specialists if required for accurate diagnosis and
management.
2. Documentation and Reporting
◦ Document all steps, from nucleic acid extraction to analytical
validation, in laboratory records.
◦ Prepare a comprehensive report summarizing the
sequencing results and their clinical implications.
◦ Upload results to the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
and notify the physician promptly if a pathogen of clinical
concern is identified.
3. QUALITY CONTROL
4. Internal QC
◦ Include positive and negative controls throughout the
nucleic acid extraction and sequencing processes.
◦ Regularly perform proficiency testing and inter-laboratory
comparisons to ensure accuracy and reliability.
5. Instrument and Reagent QC
◦ Maintain and calibrate all instruments (e.g., sequencers,
Qubit, Bioanalyzer) regularly as per manufacturer
guidelines.
◦ Store all reagents and kits according to the manufacturer’s
recommendations to preserve their integrity.
6. METHOD LIMITATIONS
7. Sensitivity and Specificity
◦ While highly sensitive, metagenomic sequencing may detect
low-level contaminants.
◦ Specificity may be influenced by the quality of the reference
database used.
8. Clinical Interpretation
◦ Detection of microbial DNA/RNA might not always indicate
active infection; clinical correlation is essential.
