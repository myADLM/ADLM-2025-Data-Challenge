Protocol for the Analytical Phase of Generating Results for
Bahia Grass, IgE, Serum
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is to
provide detailed instructions for the analytical phase of generating
results for Bahia Grass-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels in
serum. The results will be used for diagnosing allergic reactions to
Bahia Grass.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing the
analysis and documentation. It is the responsibility of the laboratory
supervisors to ensure that all personnel are adequately trained and
that the procedure is followed correctly.
2. DEFINITION
IgE: Immunoglobulin E, a class of antibody associated with allergic
reactions.
Bahia Grass: A species of grass that can trigger allergic reactions in
sensitive individuals.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Immunoassay analyzer (e.g., Phadia 250, or similar)
• Specific IgE assay reagents specific for Bahia Grass (e.g.,
ImmunoCAP)
• Calibrators and quality control materials for IgE
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Standard laboratory equipment (centrifuge, vortex mixer, etc.)
• Laboratory information system (LIS)
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND HANDLING
Specimen: Serum
• Preferred: 1-2 mL of serum
• Collection: Blood collected in a serum separator tube (SST) and
allowed to clot for 30 minutes at room temperature
• Centrifuge samples at 1500-2000 x g for 10 minutes to separate
the serum
• Aliquot serum into appropriately labeled tubes
• Store at 2-8°C if analysis is to be performed within 7 days. For
longer storage, freeze at ≤-20°C.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run quality control samples at the beginning of each analytical
run and after any significant system maintenance or recalibration.
• Utilize controls of low, medium, and high IgE concentrations.
• Document all QC results and ensure they are within the
acceptable range before proceeding with patient samples.
6. PROCEDURE
1. Preparation of Samples and Reagents:
◦ Thaw frozen serum samples, if necessary, to room
temperature.
◦ Mix all samples thoroughly by gentle inversion. Avoid foam
or bubbles.
2. Instrument Setup:
◦ Turn on the immunoassay analyzer and perform any
required daily maintenance or calibration.
◦ Ensure all reagents, calibrators, and controls specific for
Bahia Grass IgE are loaded properly into the analyzer.
◦ Program the analyzer according to the manufacturer’s
instructions for performing the specific IgE assay.
3. Running the Assay:
◦ Place patient serum samples, calibrators, and quality control
samples in the designated positions on the analyzer.
◦ Load appropriate test requisitions or worklists into the
laboratory information system (LIS).
◦ Initiate the assay run.
4. Result Validation:
◦ After the assay is complete, check the quality control
results.
◦ Ensure QC results are within the expected range. If not,
troubleshoot according to the manufacturer’s guidelines and
rerun the QC and patient samples as necessary.
◦ Review the patient results generated by the analyzer for any
flags or errors.
◦ Validate results based on established laboratory criteria.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
• Enter validated results into the LIS.
• Ensure appropriate data transfer to the electronic medical record
(EMR) or reporting system.
• Document any critical values and notify the appropriate
healthcare provider according to laboratory policy.
8. REFERENCE INTERVALS:
• Bahia Grass IgE (serum): ≤0.35 kU/L (Class 0) Note: Reference
intervals may vary based on the specific analytical method and
population.
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
• Ensure all reagents and samples are at the correct temperature
and handled properly.
• Hemolysis, lipemia, or icterus in samples may interfere with
results and should be noted.
• Patients who have received allergen immunotherapy may exhibit
altered IgE levels.
10. REFERENCES:
• ImmunoCAP Specific IgE Immunoassay Package Insert
• Manufacturer’s Instructions for Phadia 250 Immunoassay
Analyzer or similar
• CLSI Guidelines for Immunoassay Methods
11. DOCUMENTATION AND RECORD KEEPING:
• Maintain a record of all calibrator, QC, and patient results.
• Retain records of instrument maintenance and any
troubleshooting necessary for quality control failures.
• Ensure documentation is accurate, dated, and signed by the
responsible technologist.
By following this protocol, the laboratory ensures consistent, reliable,
and accurate results for Bahia Grass-specific IgE levels in serum,
aiding in the diagnosis and management of Bahia Grass allergies.
