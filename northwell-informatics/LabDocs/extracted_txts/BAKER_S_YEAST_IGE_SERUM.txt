Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Generating Results for
Baker's Yeast, IgE, Serum
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the steps and responsibilities for generating
accurate and reliable results for Baker's Yeast IgE in serum samples.
This protocol ensures standardized procedures are followed in the
analytical phase to maintain consistency and quality in Baker’s Yeast
IgE testing.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all medical laboratory scientists and
technologists to adhere to this SOP when processing and analyzing
serum samples for Baker's Yeast IgE. The laboratory supervisor is
responsible for ensuring compliance with this procedure and
addressing any issues that arise during testing.
3. DEFINITIONS
Baker’s Yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae): A species of yeast
commonly used in baking, brewing, and scientific research.
IgE (Immunoglobulin E): A type of antibody produced by the
immune system in response to allergens.
4. PROCEDURE
4.1 Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies:
• Automated Immunoassay Analyzer (e.g., ImmunoCAP, Siemens
IMMULITE)
• Calibrators and Controls specific for IgE measurement
• Baker's Yeast antigen reagent kit
• Serum Separator Tubes (SST)
• Pipettes and tips
• Sample containers and labels
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
• Laboratory Information System (LIS) access
4.2 Preparation:
1. Sample Collection:
◦ Collect blood samples in SST and allow to clot.
◦ Centrifuge samples at 3000 RPM for 10 minutes to separate
serum.
◦ Ensure serum is free from hemolysis, lipemia, or other
contaminants.
2. Sample Storage:
◦ Store serum samples at 2-8°C if testing within 7 days.
◦ For longer storage, freeze serum samples at -20°C or lower.
4.3 Calibration and Quality Control:
1. Calibration:
◦ Calibrate the immunoassay analyzer using the
manufacturer’s recommended calibrators.
◦ Document calibration performance and results.
2. Quality Control:
◦ Run both low and high-level controls specific for IgE with
each batch of tests.
◦ Ensure control results fall within the specified range before
proceeding with patient samples.
◦ Record any out-of-range control results and take corrective
action before processing patient samples.
4.4 Testing Procedure:
1. Sample Loading:
◦ Load serum samples, controls, and calibrators into the
immunoassay analyzer according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
◦ Ensure sample identification matches the laboratory
information system.
2. Assay Process:
◦ Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for running the
Baker's Yeast IgE assay on the immunoassay analyzer.
◦ Ensure all reagents are within expiration dates and stored
properly.
3. Result Generation:
◦ Upon completion of the assay, ensure that results are
automatically transmitted to the LIS.
◦ Confirm all quality control criteria have been met before
validating results.
4.5 Reporting Results:
1. Result Validation:
◦ Review and verify results in the LIS.
◦ Pay attention to any flagged results or error messages from
the analyzer.
◦ Manually review results and assess any discrepancies.
2. Critical Values:
◦ Follow the laboratory’s policy for critical values and notify
the appropriate clinical personnel immediately if critical
values are obtained.
3. Reporting:
◦ Report results in the LIS following site-specific guidelines.
◦ Ensure results are documented correctly with appropriate
interpretation if needed.
4.6 Troubleshooting:
1. Equipment Errors:
◦ Follow manufacturer’s troubleshooting guide for any
equipment malfunctions.
◦ Contact technical support if issue persists.
2. Quality Control Failures:
◦ Re-run controls if they fall outside acceptable ranges.
◦ Document and investigate the cause of quality control
failures before retesting patient samples.
3. Re-test:
◦ If patient results are flagged or do not match clinical
expectations, re-test using a fresh aliquot of the same
sample.
◦ Document discrepancies and actions taken.
5. DOCUMENTATION
All steps, observations, calibrations, quality control results, and
patient results must be logged in the Laboratory Information System
(LIS). Any deviations from the standard procedure must be noted and
explained in the laboratory records.
6. SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS
• Wear appropriate PPE at all times.
• Handle all specimens and reagents following biosafety guidelines.
• Dispose of waste according to laboratory biosafety protocols.
