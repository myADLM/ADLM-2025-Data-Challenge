Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Analytical Phase for BALD
CYPRESS, IGE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the procedures and guidelines for the analytical
phase of testing for BALD CYPRESS, IGE, SERUM in the laboratory.
The objective is to ensure accurate and reliable test results are
generated for clinical diagnosis and patient management.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the
analysis according to this SOP.
• It is the responsibility of the laboratory supervisors to ensure that
these procedures are followed correctly and that all quality control
measures are adhered to.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type: Serum Preferred Collection Container: SST (Serum
Separator Tube) Specimen Volume: Minimum 0.5 mL serum
Handling and Storage:
• After collection, allow the SST tube to clot for 30 minutes at room
temperature.
• Centrifuge the SST tube at 2000-3000 g for 10 minutes.
• Carefully transfer the supernatant serum to a labelled aliquot
tube.
• Store aliquoted serum at 2-8°C if analysis is to be performed
within 72 hours. For long-term storage, keep serum frozen at
-20°C or lower.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Automated immunoassay analyzer
• Reagents and calibrators specific to BALD CYPRESS, IGE
analysis
• Quality control materials (low, medium, and high levels)
• Pipettes and tips (calibrated)
• Centrifuge
• Refrigerators and Freezers
1. CALIBRATION AND QUALITY CONTROL
Calibration:
• Perform a full system calibration at least once a week or as
required by the manufacturer or when using a new lot of reagents/
calibrators.
• Use the calibrators provided by the reagent manufacturer and
follow the manufacturer's instructions for preparation and use.
Quality Control:
• Run quality control samples at the beginning of each shift, with
each new lot of reagents, and after any maintenance or
recalibration.
• Use quality control materials at low, medium, and high levels.
• Ensure that QC results fall within the established acceptable
ranges. If QC results are out of range, troubleshoot and resolve
the issue before proceeding with patient testing.
• Document all QC results and any corrective actions taken.
1. PROCEDURE
2. Specimen Preparation:
◦ Ensure that the serum sample is appropriately labelled and
within the acceptable storage timeframe.
◦ Allow any frozen specimens to thaw completely at room
temperature and mix well by gentle inversion before
analysis.
3. Loading Samples:
◦ Load patient samples, calibrators, and quality control
materials into the appropriate positions on the automated
immunoassay analyzer.
◦ Ensure that all samples are barcoded or entered into the
system correctly.
4. Running the Assay:
◦ Follow the instrument-specific instructions to initiate the
BALD CYPRESS, IGE assay.
◦ Ensure that the instrument performs all necessary checks,
dilutions, and incubations according to the manufacturer's
protocol.
5. Reviewing and Validating Results:
◦ Once the assay is complete, review the generated data for
any flags, errors, or QC failures.
◦ Validate the results against the reference ranges provided
by the manufacturer.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results that fall within the expected reference range and pass all
QC checks can be released immediately.
• Results that are outside the reference range or have flagged
issues should be reviewed, and repeat testing may be required.
• Document all reportable results, ensuring that patient identifiers
are correct and traceable.
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS) and
verify them for accuracy before releasing them to the healthcare
provider.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• The reference intervals for BALD CYPRESS, IGE should be
based on manufacturer guidelines or established laboratory
norms. Typical reference intervals may vary, and it is essential to
consult current literature or the assay insert for accurate ranges.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to the manufacturer’s assay insert for detailed limitations of
the BALD CYPRESS, IGE immunoassay.
• Potential interference from hemolysis, lipemia, or icteric samples
should be noted and considered when interpreting results.
