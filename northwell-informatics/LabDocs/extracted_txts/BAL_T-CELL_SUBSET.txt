BAL (Bronchoalveolar Lavage) T-Cell Subset Analysis SOP
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the steps and responsibilities
involved in analyzing T-cell subsets in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL)
fluid specimens to ensure accurate and reliable results.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing T-cell
subset analysis on BAL fluid specimens and ensuring that all
procedures are correctly followed and documented.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all personnel involved in the processing and
analysis of BAL fluid specimens for T-cell subset determination within
the clinical laboratory.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type:
• Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid
Specimen Volume:
• Minimum volume: 1 mL
• Optimal volume: 3-5 mL
Specimen Collection:
• BAL fluid should be collected following standard bronchoscopy
procedures.
• Ensure that the sample is properly labeled with patient
identification, date, and time of collection.
Specimen Handling:
• Transport the sample to the laboratory immediately after
collection.
• If there is a delay in processing, keep the sample at 4±2°C and
process within 24 hours.
4. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
Reagents:
• PBS (phosphate-buffered saline)
• 0.1% BSA (bovine serum albumin) in PBS
• Flow cytometry antibodies (e.g., CD3, CD4, CD8, CD45)
Supplies:
• Centrifuge tubes (15 mL conical tubes)
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Flow cytometry tubes
• BAL buffer (PBS + 2% FBS)
• Flow cytometer
5. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation:
1. Mix the BAL fluid sample well to ensure even distribution of
cells.
2. Transfer the sample to a conical centrifuge tube.
3. Centrifuge at 300 x g for 10 minutes at 4°C.
4. Carefully aspirate the supernatant, leaving approximately 200
μL of fluid to resuspend the cell pellet.
B. Cell Counting:
1. Resuspend the cell pellet in 1 mL of PBS.
2. Perform a cell count using an automated cell counter or
hemocytometer.
3. Record the total and viable cell count.
C. Staining:
1. Aliquot the appropriate number of cells (minimum 100,000 cells
per tube) into flow cytometry tubes.
2. Add the required volume of PBS with 0.1% BSA to each tube to
a final volume of 100 μL.
3. Add the specific antibodies for CD3, CD4, CD8, and CD45
according to the manufacturer's instructions.
4. Incubate the tubes at room temperature for 20 minutes in the
dark.
5. After incubation, wash the cells by adding 2 mL of PBS and
centrifuge at 300 x g for 5 minutes at room temperature.
6. Aspirate the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in 200 μL
of PBS.
D. Flow Cytometry Analysis:
1. Acquire the cells on a flow cytometer.
2. Adjust the settings for forward and side scatter to appropriately
gate the lymphocyte population.
3. Record at least 10,000 events per sample.
4. Analyze data for CD3, CD4, and CD8 expression.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Include a positive control (predefined normal cells) and
negative control (no antibodies) with each run.
2. Review the internal QC results to ensure the validity of the test
results.
3. Compare the test results with the historical data to identify any
deviations.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Results are reviewed and verified by the technologist.
2. Data is transmitted to the LIS (Laboratory Information System)
using pre-defined reporting settings.
3. Include the total number of cells, percentage of CD3+, CD4+,
and CD8+ cells, and any significant findings.
8. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If there is a discrepancy in QC results, reprocess the sample if
possible.
• If cell recovery is low, verify the centrifugation steps and sample
handling procedures.
• Check antibody quality and expiration date if staining appears
suboptimal.
9. REFERENCE RANGES
• The reference ranges for T-cell subsets in BAL fluid should be
defined based on institutional data or literature review.
10. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s product inserts for flow cytometry antibodies.
• Relevant clinical laboratory standards for flow cytometry.
• Protocols and literature on BAL processing and T-cell subset
analysis.
11. DOCUMENT REVISION HISTORY
• Document any changes or updates made to the SOP, including
the date of revision and the nature of the changes.
12. SAFETY PRECAUTIONS
• Follow all institutional biosafety guidelines.
• Use appropriate PPE (personal protective equipment) when
handling BAL fluid specimens and reagents.
• Dispose of all biohazardous waste according to institutional
protocols.
