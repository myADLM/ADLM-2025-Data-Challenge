Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Analytical Phase for
BAMBOO SHOOT, IGE, SERUM Analysis
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to provide detailed instructions for the
analysis and generation of results for Bamboo Shoot IgE in serum
samples. This ensures consistent and reliable results for patient
diagnosis and management.
1. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel performing Bamboo
Shoot IgE analysis in serum samples.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing the
analysis and generating results according to this SOP. It is the
responsibility of the laboratory supervisor to ensure compliance with
this procedure.
1. DEFINITIONS
Bamboo Shoot IgE: Immunoglobulin E specific to bamboo shoot
allergens.
Serum Sample: The component of blood obtained after
centrifugation, containing no blood cells or clotting factors.

• Equipment Maintenance Logs
• Temperature Monitoring Logs
• Manufacturer’s Instructions for the IgE assay kit
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Collection:
• Preferred/acceptable:
◦ 5 mL of serum collected in a serum-separating tube (SST).
◦ The blood must clot at room temperature (20-25°C) for 30
minutes and then be centrifuged at 1500-2000 x g for 10
minutes.
Specimen Handling:
• Serum must be aliquoted to avoid more than one freeze-thaw
cycle.
• Store serum at 2-8°C if tested within 24 hours; if not, store at
-20°C or colder for longer storage.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
• Specimens without proper labeling or collection date/times.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Immunoassay analyzer or ELISA reader, calibrated and
maintained.
• IgE Immunoassay Kit specific for bamboo shoot allergens.
• Micropipettes and tips.
• Timer.
• Centrifuge.
• Vortex mixer.
• Standard laboratory glassware and plasticware.
1. PROCEDURE
Calibration and Quality Control:
• Calibrate the analyzer as per manufacturer instructions.
• Include both high and low external controls with each batch.
• Perform a calibration verification every 6 months or with a new
reagent lot.
• Record all QC results in the QC log.
Assay Procedure:
1. Preparation:
◦ Thaw serum samples if frozen and vortex to mix thoroughly.
◦ Ensure all assay reagents and samples are at room
temperature before use.
2. Sample and Reagent Addition:
◦ Pipette the required volume of standards, controls, and
patient samples into the appropriate wells of the assay
plate.
◦ Add the assay buffer and detection antibodies according to
the kit's instructions.
◦ Incubate the plate as specified in the kit insert.
3. Washing:
◦ Wash the plate according to the kit protocol to remove any
unbound substances.
4. Substrate Addition:
◦ Add substrate solution to each well and incubate for the
recommended time, protecting the plate from direct light.
5. Stopping Reaction:
◦ Add the appropriate stopping solution to each well.
6. Reading the Plate:
◦ Read the absorbance at the specified wavelength using an
ELISA reader.
◦ Ensure the reader is appropriately calibrated and blank
corrected if required.
7. RESULT CALCULATION AND INTERPRETATION
• Use the standard curve generated from the calibrators to
determine the IgE concentration in patient samples.
• Ensure the concentration values fall within the reportable range of
the assay.
• Validate the results by ensuring both internal and external controls
fall within their specified ranges.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Report results in IU/mL as determined by the assay.
• Flag any results that are outside the reference range.
• Critical values should be communicated to the requesting
physician immediately.
• Use site-specific reporting guidelines for data entry and result
validation.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Reference intervals will be established based on the population
studies provided with the assay kit.
• Document regularly reviewed and updated intervals.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Maintain all QC records.
• Perform routine maintenance on the analytical equipment.
• Document any deviations and corrective actions taken.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to the manufacturer's insert for limitations, interferences,
and cross-reactivities specific to the Bamboo Shoot IgE assay.
