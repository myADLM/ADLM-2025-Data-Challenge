Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for BANANA, IGE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to provide detailed instructions for the
analytical phase of generating results for BANANA, IGE, and SERUM
tests in order to ensure accuracy, consistency, and reliability of
results as required by CLIA regulations.
Responsibility:
• Designated staff are responsible for performing and documenting
the analysis according to this procedure.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring all procedures are
followed and that staff are adequately trained.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Centrifuge
• Automated Immunoassay Analyzer (e.g., Siemens Immulite,
Abbott Architect, etc.)
• Pipettes and Pipette Tips
• Microcentrifuge Tubes
• Calibrated Balances
Reagents:
• BANANA-specific reagents per analyzer manufacturer's
guidelines
• IGE-specific reagents per analyzer manufacturer's guidelines
• Serum control reagents (Quality Control materials)
• Calibration materials for immunoassay analyzer
Supplies:
• Serum Separator Tubes (SST)
• Plain Red Top Tubes for Serum collection
• Appropriate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
1. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation:
1. Ensure that the serum samples have been collected, received,
and accessioned correctly.
2. Centrifuge the whole blood samples in Serum Separator Tubes
(SST) for 10 minutes at 3500 RPM.
3. If required, aliquot serum samples into labeled microcentrifuge
tubes, avoiding hemolysis or contamination.
B. Analyzer Setup and Calibration:
1. Turn on the Immunoassay Analyzer and perform any routine
maintenance as per manufacturer guidelines.
2. Load the appropriate reagents, controls, and calibrators for
BANANA and IGE assays.
3. Run the calibration process if due, following analyzer-specific
instructions to ensure accurate calibration.
4. Validate calibration results before proceeding with sample
analysis.
C. Running the Tests:
1. Load prepared serum samples into the appropriate sample
racks on the Immunoassay Analyzer.
2. Initiate the BANANA and IGE tests using the analyzer software:
◦ Select the "BANANA" assay protocol for BANANA-specific
testing.
◦ Select the "IGE" assay protocol for IGE-specific testing.
3. Allow the assays to run to completion according to the analyzer
set protocols.
4. Verify that all tests have successfully completed without errors.
If any anomalies or errors are detected, troubleshoot as
necessary.
D. Quality Control:
1. Run Quality Control (QC) materials (both positive and negative
controls) as per manufacturer guidelines and record the results.
2. Ensure QC results are within the acceptable ranges prior to
result reporting. Troubleshoot and resolve issues if QC results
fall outside acceptable limits.
3. REPORTING RESULTS
A. Reviewing and Verifying Results:
1. Validate raw data and ensure it passes all quality checks set by
the laboratory and analyzer.
2. Document any deviations, repeats, or anomalies observed
during analysis.
3. Confirm results are reviewed and verified by a trained
technologist before release.
B. Transmitting Results:
1. Enter verified results into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS) promptly.
2. Ensure results are accurately and completely transmitted to the
LIS.
3. Notify relevant stakeholders (e.g., ordering physician) if results
indicate critical values.
4. REFERENCE INTERVALS AND RESULT INTERPRETATION
A. BANANA:
• Interpret as per clinical guidelines or as directed by the
laboratory's established reference intervals.
B. IGE (Immunoglobulin E):
• Negative: < 100 kU/L
• Borderline: 100-200 kU/L
• Positive: > 200 kU/L
C. Serum:
• Interpret serum-related analytes (e.g., electrolytes, proteins)
according to laboratory-specific reference ranges.
1. DOCUMENTATION AND RECORD-KEEPING
A. Ensure all activities, calibration runs, maintenance logs, QC
results, and sample analysis records are accurately documented. B.
Maintain hard copies or digital records as required by laboratory
SOPs and regulatory requirements. C. Store documentation securely
and ensure it is easily retrievable for inspections or audits.
1. QUALITY ASSURANCE
A. Periodically audit procedures to ensure compliance with SOPs. B.
Review and update SOPs as necessary to adhere to best practices
and regulatory guidelines.
