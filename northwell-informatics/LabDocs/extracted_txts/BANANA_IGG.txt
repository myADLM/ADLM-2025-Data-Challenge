Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating BANANA IGG Results
1. PURPOSE
To establish a standardized procedure for the analysis of BANANA
IGG levels in specimens received in the laboratory. This SOP aims to
ensure consistent and accurate results through proper handling,
processing, and documentation.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing the
BANANA IGG testing according to this SOP. It is the responsibility of
all laboratory staff to follow the procedures outlined and to report any
issues or deviations to the supervisor.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred/acceptable: Blood specimen collected in a plain red-top
tube or serum separator tube (SST).
• Volume required: Minimum 2 mL serum.
• Unacceptable: Hemolyzed samples, specimens collected in
anticoagulant tubes (e.g., EDTA, citrate), specimens received
after the stability period of 48 hours at room temperature or 5
days refrigerated.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• BANANA IGG ELISA kit (Brand/Manufacturer): Store at 2-8°C. Do
not use past the expiration date.
• Plate reader capable of reading at 450 nm.
• Incubator set at 37°C.
• Standard laboratory supplies: pipettes, microcentrifuge tubes,
vortex mixer.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation
1. Verify that specimens are correctly labeled and match the
requisition.
2. Centrifuge blood specimens collected in SST tubes at 3000
RPM for 10 minutes.
3. Transfer serum to appropriately labeled microcentrifuge tubes.
B. Assay Setup
1. Remove the BANANA IGG ELISA kit from refrigeration and
allow it to reach room temperature.
2. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions to prepare reagents.
3. Add 100 µL of standards, controls, and patient specimens into
the assigned wells of the ELISA plate.
C. Incubation
1. Incubate the plate at 37°C for 60 minutes.
2. Wash the plate according to the manufacturer's instructions.
3. Add the required amount of conjugate to each well.
4. Incubate the plate again at 37°C for 30 minutes.
5. Perform a wash step as specified by the kit instructions.
6. Add the substrate solution to each well and incubate at room
temperature for 15 minutes, avoiding direct light.
D. Measurement and Result Generation
1. Add stop solution to each well as per manufacturer's
instructions.
2. Measure the optical density (OD) at 450 nm using the plate
reader.
3. Generate a standard curve from the OD readings of the kit
standards.
4. Calculate the BANANA IGG concentrations in patient
specimens by interpolating their OD readings on the standard
curve.
E. Quality Control
1. Run kit controls (high, low, and blank) and ensure their results
fall within the manufacturer’s specified range.
2. Validate the testing process by reviewing quality control data
and ensuring no deviations.
F. Reporting Results
1. Enter results into the LIS (Laboratory Information System).
2. Review and verify results before releasing to the medical
records.
G. Troubleshooting
1. If QC results are out of range, recheck specimen and control
preparation steps.
2. Repeat the assay if necessary.
3. Consult the supervisor for persistent issues and document all
troubleshooting steps.
4. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Normal reference range for BANANA IGG: <10 EU/mL.
• Results >10 EU/mL may indicate an allergy or sensitization to
bananas.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the BANANA IGG ELISA kit insert for specific limitations
related to reagent stability, interferences, and assay specificity.
1. REFERENCES
• BANANA IGG ELISA kit insert.
• Relevant clinical guidelines and laboratory standards.
Documentation:
• Record all procedural steps, QC data, and outcomes in the
laboratory logbook for traceability.
• Ensure all records are maintained according to regulatory
requirements and laboratory policies.
By following this SOP, laboratory personnel will be able to perform
BANANA IGG testing accurately and consistently, ensuring high-
quality patient care.
