STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP) BAP1-TUMOR
PREDISPOSITION SYNDROME, BAP1 FULL GENE ANALYSIS,
VARIES
1. PURPOSE: The intent of this protocol is to outline the
procedures for the analytical phase of generating results for
BAP1-Tumor Predisposition Syndrome, specifically targeting
the analysis of the full BAP1 gene. This procedure ensures that
all steps are systematically followed to achieve accurate and
reliable results.
Responsibility:
• Technical personnel are responsible for executing and adhering to
this protocol.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring adherence, reviewing
results, and validating the findings.
1. DEFINITION: BAP1 (BRCA-Associated Protein 1) Tumor
Predisposition Syndrome is a hereditary condition that
increases the risk for several cancer types due to mutations in
the BAP1 gene.
• BAP1 Gene Analysis encompasses the sequencing and
interpretation of the entire BAP1 gene to detect mutations.
1. PROCEDURE:
• The analytical procedure involves several key steps which include
DNA extraction, amplification, sequencing, data analysis, and
result reporting.
A. DNA Extraction:
• Prepare the laboratory environment and ensure all necessary
equipment and reagents are available and calibrated.
• Extract genomic DNA from the submitted specimen using a
validated extraction method (e.g., column-based, magnetic bead-
based) as per manufacturer’s protocol.
• Measure the concentration and purity of the extracted DNA using
a spectrophotometer or fluorometer. Document DNA quality on
the DNA Quality Monitoring Log.
B. DNA Amplification:
• Design forward and reverse primers spanning the full BAP1 gene,
including all exons and intronic regions.
• Utilize a PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) or a comparable
amplification method to amplify target regions.
• Ensure the proper settings of the thermal cycler (e.g., initial
denaturation, cycling conditions, and final extension). Verify
conditions with the PCR Protocol Log.
C. Sequencing:
• Perform sequencing using an established platform (e.g., Sanger
sequencing, Next Generation Sequencing (NGS)).
• Prepare the library following established protocols, including DNA
fragmentation, adapter ligation, and purification.
• Load the prepared library onto the sequencer and follow the
manufacturer’s instructions for sequencing.
• Document sequencing run on the Sequencing Run Log, including
date, time, and operator initials.
D. Data Analysis:
• Transfer raw sequencing data to the designated bioinformatics
pipeline.
• Utilize alignment software to map sequencing reads to the
reference genome.
• Detect variants (e.g., single nucleotide variants, insertions,
deletions) using variant calling software.
• Annotate identified variants and classify the potential impact
based on ACMG (American College of Medical Genetics and
Genomics) guidelines.
E. Quality Control:
• Include negative and positive controls in each run to ensure the
proper functioning of all steps.
• Validate the precision and accuracy of the test through predefined
quality control samples.
• Document any deviations or failures and perform corrective
actions as necessary.
F. Reporting Results:
• Review and interpret the analyzed data. Confirm critical findings
through a secondary analysis if discrepancies are found.
• Summarize findings in a comprehensive report, including detected
mutations, their clinical significance, and potential implications for
the patient.
• Review and sign the report by the laboratory director or
designated specialist.
• Ensure the results are uploaded to the Laboratory Information
System (LIS) from where it can be securely accessed.
1. SAMPLE INTEGRITY:
• Ensure all samples meet the required criteria for analysis.
• Any compromised samples (e.g., hemolysis, insufficient quantity)
should be flagged, and a new sample should be requested.
• Document sample status and any actions taken in the Sample
Integrity Log.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
• Potential limitations should be clearly stated in the final report to
caution users regarding the sensitivity and specificity confines of
the assay used.
• Refer to relevant literature or manufacturer guidance to maintain
updated understanding of the methodology.
1. REFERENCES:
• Include reference to standard guidelines and protocols from the
ACMG, relevant literature, and the manufacturer’s instructions for
the instruments and reagents used.
