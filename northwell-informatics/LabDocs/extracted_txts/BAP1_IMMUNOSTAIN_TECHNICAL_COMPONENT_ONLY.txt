Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for BAP1 Immunostain,
Technical Component Only
1. PURPOSE: To outline the procedures and responsibilities
involved in the analytical phase of generating results for BAP1
immunostaining in tissue samples.
2. SCOPE: This SOP applies to all laboratory staff responsible for
performing the technical component of BAP1 immunostaining in
a CLIA-certified laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY: Designated laboratory personnel trained in
BAP1 immunostaining procedures are responsible for
performing the assay, monitoring quality control (QC)
procedures, and documenting all relevant data.
4. DEFINITION: BAP1 (BRCA1-associated protein 1)
immunostaining is a procedure used to detect BAP1 protein
expression in tissue specimens. The absence or presence of
BAP1 staining can be an important diagnostic tool for certain
cancers.
5. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS:
◦ Microtome
◦ Water bath
◦ Incubator
◦ Automated immunostainer or manual staining setup
◦ BAP1 antibody (validated for immunohistochemistry)
◦ Secondary antibody conjugated to HRP or AP
◦ DAB (3,3'-diaminobenzidine) substrate or appropriate
chromogen
◦ Hematoxylin for counterstaining
◦ Xylene and alcohol series for deparaffinization and
rehydration
◦ Mounting media
◦ Positive and negative control slides
6. PROCEDURES:
A. Tissue Preparation:
1. Ensure all tissue specimens are formalin-fixed and
paraffin-embedded (FFPE).
2. Cut 4-5µm sections from FFPE blocks using a microtome.
3. Float sections in a 40-45°C water bath and then mount on
positively charged glass slides.
4. Allow slides to dry at room temperature and then incubate
at 60°C for 1 hour to affix sections to slides.
B. Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
1. Place slides in xylene for three 5-minute changes to
remove paraffin.
2. Rehydrate slides through a graded alcohol series (100%,
95%, and 80%) for 3 minutes each and rinse in distilled
water.
C. Antigen Retrieval:
1. Perform antigen retrieval by heating slides in an
appropriate buffer (e.g., citrate buffer, pH 6.0) using a
pressure cooker, microwave, or water bath.
2. Allow slides to cool to room temperature and rinse in
distilled water followed by PBS.
D. Immunostaining:
1. Load slides onto an automated immunostainer and follow
the manufacturer's instructions or proceed with manual
staining as follows:
▪ Block endogenous peroxidase activity by incubating
slides with 3% hydrogen peroxide for 10 minutes.
▪ Apply primary BAP1 antibody and incubate for the
specified time (typically 30-60 minutes) at room
temperature.
▪ Rinse slides in PBS or TBS.
▪ Apply the secondary antibody and incubate per kit
instructions.
▪ Rinse and apply the DAB substrate solution until the
desired staining intensity is achieved.
2. Rinse slides in distilled water.
E. Counterstaining and Mounting:
1. Counterstain slides with hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes.
2. Rinse in running tap water and then dehydrate through
graded alcohols (80%, 95%, 100%) and clear in xylene.
3. Apply mounting media and coverslip.
7. QUALITY CONTROL:
◦ Include positive and negative control slides with each batch
to ensure staining accuracy.
◦ Document QC results and take corrective actions for any
deviations as necessary.
8. REPORTING RESULTS:
◦ The stained slides are to be reviewed by a pathologist for
interpretation of results.
◦ Technical staff will ensure all slides are properly labeled,
processed, and delivered to the pathologist for evaluation.
