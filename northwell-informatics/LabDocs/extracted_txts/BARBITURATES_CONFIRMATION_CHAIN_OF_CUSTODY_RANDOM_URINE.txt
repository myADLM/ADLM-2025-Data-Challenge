Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Barbiturates Confirmation, Chain of Custody,
Random, Urine
1. PURPOSE
To define the procedure for the confirmation of barbiturates in urine
specimens received under chain of custody conditions. This SOP
ensures accurate, precise, and legally defensible results following the
established guidelines and protocols.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory staff are responsible for carrying out the
procedures as defined.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring compliance with this
SOP and addressing any deviations or issues.
• All staff must adhere to the chain of custody requirements without
exception.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type:
• Urine sample.
Specimen Volume:
• Minimum required volume is 10 mL urine.
Specimen Containers:
• Chain of custody urine containers with tamper-evident seals must
be used.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens that arrive without the required chain of custody
documentation.
• Specimens that are not properly sealed or have signs of
tampering.
• Specimens that are improperly labeled or lack necessary
identifiers.
Storage and Stability:
• Specimens should be stored refrigerated at 2-8°C if not
immediately analyzed.
• Urine specimens are stable for up to 72 hours when refrigerated.
For long-term storage, freeze at -20°C or lower.
1. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
• Gas Chromatograph-Mass Spectrometer (GC-MS) or Liquid
Chromatograph-Mass Spectrometer (LC-MS/MS)
• Calibrated pipettes and associated tips
• Vortex mixer
• Centrifuge
• Chain of custody forms
• Appropriate sample preparation reagents and consumables
• Analytical balance
• Refrigerator/freezer for specimen storage
1. CALIBRATION AND QUALITY CONTROL
Calibration:
• Prepare calibration standards for barbiturates at concentrations
appropriate for the assay's expected range.
• Perform instrument calibration at the start of the analytical run.
• Calibration verification must be performed at least once per
analytical batch.
Quality Control:
• Utilize control materials at minimum high, medium, and low
concentrations within the assay range.
• Include at least one blank and one positive control in each
analytical batch.
• Each analytical run must include a minimum of 10% quality
control samples.
1. PROCEDURE
Sample Preparation:
• Upon receipt, verify sample integrity and proper documentation
using the chain of custody form.
• Briefly inspect the sample container to ensure no tampering.
• Document the receipt of the specimen and assign a unique
laboratory identification number.
Extraction:
• Adjust the urine sample to room temperature.
• Aliquot 5 mL of urine into a labeled centrifuge tube.
• Add internal standard to each sample, vortex to mix thoroughly.
• Perform solid-phase extraction (SPE) or liquid-liquid extraction
(LLE) as detailed in the lab's validated extraction protocol.
• Evaporate the solvent under a stream of nitrogen, if applicable,
and reconstitute in the appropriate solvent for analysis.
Analysis:
• Transfer the reconstituted sample to an appropriate vial for GC-
MS or LC-MS/MS analysis.
• Set up the instrument and load samples according to established
protocols.
• Analyze the samples, and ensure the injection sequence includes
calibration standards and quality control samples.
Data Acquisition and Analysis:
• Acquire and process the data using the instrument's software.
• Ensure the calibration curve is within acceptable parameters
before proceeding with sample quantitation.
• Compare the sample's peak area/height with the calibration curve
to quantify barbiturates.
1. DATA REVIEW AND REPORTING
• Review all chromatograms/mass spectra for accuracy and
presence of interfering substances.
• Validate results by checking against control samples and
reference ranges.
• Any deviations from acceptable criteria must be documented and
addressed.
Reporting Results:
• Report all data in the laboratory information system (LIS).
• Interpret the results according to the reference standard for
barbiturates.
• Include any relevant comments regarding the sample integrity and
analysis process.
• Ensure all chain of custody documentation accompanies the
reported results.
1. CHAIN OF CUSTODY
• Maintain chain of custody documentation from sample receipt to
final reporting.
• Ensure each handling and transfer step is logged, with date, time,
and personnel initials.
• Secure and store samples in accordance with chain of custody
protocols.
1. REFERENCES
• Standard Method for the Identification of Barbiturates in Urine by
GC-MS or LC-MS/MS.
• Laboratory internal validation and verification documents.
• Manufacturer’s instructions for instrumentation and reagents.
• Guidelines for Forensic Toxicology.
1. RECORDS AND DOCUMENTATION
• Chain of custody documentation logs.
• Daily quality control records.
• Calibration confirmation records.
• Analytical batch documentation with control and patient results.
1. REVISION HISTORY
• Document version and updates.
• Review and approval dates.
Effective implementation of this SOP will ensure the reliable and
legally defensible confirmation of barbiturates in urine under chain of
custody conditions.
