Standard Operating Procedure for Analytical Phase of
Barbiturates Confirmation in Random Urine
1. PURPOSE
To outline the analytical procedures required for the confirmation of
barbiturates in random urine samples, ensuring accurate and reliable
results.
2. SCOPE
This procedure is applicable to all laboratory personnel involved in
the processing and analysis of urine samples for barbiturates
confirmation.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Laboratory Technologists: Perform sample extraction, analysis,
and data interpretation.
• Supervisors/Lab Managers: Ensure compliance with SOP and
quality assurance protocols.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred Specimen: 30 mL of random urine.
• Collection: Specimen should be collected in a clean plastic
specimen container without any preservative.
• Stability: Specimens should be stored at 2-8°C and analyzed
within 7 days of collection. If longer storage is required, freeze at
-20°C.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) system
• Standard solutions of barbiturates
• Quality control materials
• Clean plastic specimen containers
• Centrifuge
• Extraction solvents: Methanol, Ethyl acetate, Ammonium
hydroxide
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• QC samples should be included with each batch of specimens
analyzed.
• Use commercially available QC materials containing known
concentrations of barbiturates.
• Perform QC at two levels (high and low) at the beginning and end
of each run.
• Acceptable limits: As per the manufacturer's certificate of analysis.
7. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation
1. Write down relevant patient information and specimen
identifiers on the Sample Log.
2. Mix the urine specimen thoroughly by gently inverting the
container.
3. Aliquot 5 mL of the urine sample into a clean test tube.
B. Sample Extraction
1. Add 2 mL of methanol to the aliquoted urine sample and mix
well.
2. Centrifuge the mixture at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes to precipitate
proteins.
3. Transfer the supernatant into a clean test tube.
4. Add 2 mL of ethyl acetate and 100 µL of ammonium hydroxide
to the supernatant.
5. Vortex the mixture for 2 minutes.
6. Centrifuge again at 3000 rpm for 5 minutes.
7. Carefully transfer the organic layer into a clean vial without
disturbing the aqueous layer.
C. Instrument Analysis (GC-MS)
1. Load the extracted samples, calibrators, and QC samples into
the GC-MS autosampler.
2. Set up the GC-MS system according to the manufacturer's
instructions with appropriate parameters for barbiturate
analysis.
3. Perform a system suitability test to ensure proper instrument
function before sample analysis.
4. Initiate the run sequence, ensuring that calibrators and QCs are
included at appropriate intervals.
D. Data Analysis
1. Review chromatograms for each sample, calibrator, and QC to
confirm the presence and integration of barbiturate peaks.
2. Compare sample peak retention times and mass spectra with
those of the calibrators.
3. Calculate the concentration of barbiturates in the urine samples
based on the calibration curve.
4. Validate the run by checking that QC results fall within the
acceptable limits.
E. Result Reporting
1. Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS) and
verify for accuracy.
2. Flag and document any samples with concentrations above the
reporting limit or outside QC acceptance criteria.
3. Communicate critical results to the designated healthcare
provider following laboratory protocol.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Cross-reactivity with other drugs/substances present in urine may
potentially affect the results.
• Inadequate sample preparation or extraction may lead to
inaccurate quantification.
9. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions for the GC-MS system.
• Validated method protocols for urine barbiturates confirmation.
10. DOCUMENTATION
• Maintain records of all specimens, calibrators, and QC samples
processed.
• Store raw data and generated results in accordance with
laboratory data retention policies.
By following this SOP, the laboratory ensures the precise and
accurate confirmation of barbiturates in random urine samples,
supporting effective patient care and treatment.
