BARBITURATES CONFIRMATION PROTOCOL, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
This protocol outlines the procedure for the confirmation of
barbiturate presence in serum samples using Gas Chromatography-
Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS). The method ensures accurate
identification and quantification of barbiturates.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for
performing the analysis following this procedure. All staff involved
must be trained and proficient in GC-MS operations and must ensure
that results are accurate and documented correctly.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred Specimen:
• Serum obtained from blood drawn using serum separation tubes
(SST).
Sample Volume:
• Minimum 2 mL of serum.
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Hemolyzed or lipemic serum.
• Specimens collected in preservatives that interfere with GC-MS
analysis.
3. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
Equipment:
• Gas Chromatograph coupled to a Mass Spectrometer (GC-MS),
properly calibrated.
• Centrifuge.
• Micropipette.
• Vortex mixer.
• Water bath or heating block.
• Refrigerated centrifuge.
Reagents:
• Methanol (HPLC grade).
• GC-MS grade internal standard solution (e.g., Deuterated
Barbiturate).
• Derivatization reagent (e.g., BSTFA with 1% TMCS).
• Extraction solvents like Ethyl Acetate.
• Calibration standards for barbiturates (e.g., Phenobarbital,
Secobarbital).
4. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation:
• Centrifuge: Centrifuge the serum specimen at 3000 rpm for 10
minutes to ensure clear separation.
• Aliquot: Transfer 1 mL of serum into a clean, dry test tube.
• Add Internal Standard: Add 50 µL of the internal standard
solution to the serum sample.
• Extraction: Add 3 mL of ethyl acetate to the sample and vortex
for 2 minutes.
• Centrifuge: Centrifuge at 4000 rpm for 5 minutes to separate the
layers.
• Collect Supernatant: Pipette off the organic layer into a clean
vial.
• Evaporation: Evaporate the organic solvent under nitrogen at
40°C until dry.
• Derivatization: Add 100 µL of BSTFA with 1% TMCS to the dry
residue, vortex, and heat at 60°C for 30 minutes.
B. GC-MS Analysis:
• Instrument Setup: Ensure the GC-MS is calibrated and the
system is ready for analysis. Check the column conditions and
detector settings.
• Injection: Inject 1 µL of the derivatized sample into the GC-MS.
• Settings: Set GC parameters (oven temperature, flow rate, split
ratio) according to the standardized method for barbiturate
analysis.
• Analysis: Run the sample and monitor for the retention times and
mass spectra characteristic of barbiturates.
• Identification and Quantification: Compare the sample spectral
data against calibration standards for specific barbiturates.
5. DATA ANALYSIS AND INTERPRETATION
• Processing of raw data involves integration of peak areas of
detected barbiturates and normalization against the internal
standard.
• Calculations: Quantify the concentration of barbiturates in the
specimen using the calibration curve and data obtained from
internal standards.
• Quality Control: Run controls and blanks alongside patient
samples to ensure accuracy. Use both commercial control
materials and internal quality control specimens.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results should be reviewed by a trained technologist for
validation.
• Reference Intervals: Interpret the quantified barbiturate
concentration against established reference intervals for clinical
significance.
• Documentation: Ensure all data is accurately recorded in the
LIS, including any deviations or troubleshooting steps taken
during the analysis.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Follow strict QC procedures for the GC-MS, including calibration
verifications and routine maintenance checks.
• Document and address any QC failures promptly before reporting
patient results.
8. SAFETY AND COMPLIANCE
• Personal Protective Equipment: Use laboratory coats, gloves,
and goggles while handling chemicals.
• Waste Disposal: Dispose of all chemical waste according to
laboratory safety protocols.
• Ensure adherence to all regulatory guidelines for handling and
reporting biological specimens and analytical data.
9. REFERENCES
• Relevant GC-MS manufacturer manual.
• Barbiturate calibration standards data sheets.
• Laboratory quality control guidelines and procedures.
Please ensure that all procedural steps are followed meticulously;
any deviations should be documented and discussed with a
supervisor. This SOP must be reviewed and updated regularly to
reflect the latest analytical standards and laboratory policies.
