Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Title: Analytical Phase for
Generating Results for Barbiturates in Umbilical Cord Tissue
1. PURPOSE To outline the procedure for the analysis of
barbiturates in umbilical cord tissue samples using Liquid
Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS).
2. SCOPE This procedure applies to the determination of
barbiturate levels in umbilical cord tissue as part of newborn
toxicology screening in a CLIA-certified laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY Designated laboratory personnel are
responsible for performing the analytical procedures as outlined
in this SOP, documenting the results accurately, and reporting
any discrepancies or issues to the laboratory supervisor.
4. DEFINITIONS Barbiturates: A group of central nervous system
depressants used in the treatment of anxiety, insomnia, and
seizure disorders. Umbilical Cord Tissue: The tissue connecting
the fetus to the placenta, which can be used for drug testing to
reveal exposure in utero.
5. EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS
• Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS) system
• Centrifuge
• Homogenizer
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Vortex mixer
• Analytical balance
• Reagent-grade water
• Organic solvents (e.g., methanol, acetonitrile)
• Barbiturate standard solutions
• Internal standard solution
• Umbilical cord tissue samples
• Calibrated glass or plastic sample containers
• Gloves, lab coat, safety glasses
1. REAGENTS AND SOLUTIONS
• Reagent-grade water
• Methanol
• Acetonitrile
• Barbiturate standard solutions (calibrators)
• Internal standard solution
1. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation 1. Label each sample container with the
appropriate patient identifier. 2. Weigh approximately 1 gram of
umbilical cord tissue and record the weight. 3. Homogenize the tissue
sample in a homogenizer tube with 5 mL of reagent-grade water. 4.
Centrifuge the homogenized sample at 4000 rpm for 10 minutes. 5.
Transfer the supernatant to a clean container.
B. Extraction 1. Add 5 mL of acetonitrile to the supernatant and vortex
mix for 1 minute. 2. Centrifuge the mixture at 4000 rpm for 10
minutes. 3. Transfer the clear supernatant to a clean container. 4.
Evaporate the solvent under a stream of nitrogen to dryness. 5.
Reconstitute the residue in 200 µL of initial mobile phase (e.g., 50:50
methanol:water).
C. Calibration and Quality Control 1. Prepare calibration standards
and quality control (QC) samples by spiking blank umbilical cord
tissue homogenate with known concentrations of barbiturate
standards and internal standards. 2. Process calibration and QC
samples concurrently with patient samples following the Sample
Preparation and Extraction steps.
D. LC-MS Analysis 1. Inject 10 µL of sample extract into the LC-MS
system. 2. Use appropriate chromatographic conditions, such as: a.
Column: C18, 2.1 mm x 50 mm, 1.7 µm particle size b. Mobile phase:
Methanol:Water (50:50) with 0.1% formic acid c. Flow rate: 0.4 mL/
min d. Run time: 10 minutes per sample 3. Operate the mass
spectrometer in positive ion mode, monitoring specific ion transitions
for barbiturates and the internal standard. 4. Generate a calibration
curve by plotting the peak area ratio of each barbiturate to the
internal standard against the known concentrations.
E. Data Analysis 1. Analyze the LC-MS data using appropriate
software. 2. Identify and quantify barbiturates by comparing sample
peak areas to the calibration curves. 3. Verify that QC samples fall
within acceptable ranges. 4. Report any deviations to the supervisor
and take appropriate corrective actions as needed.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Document all results in the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
2. Review and verify results according to laboratory
protocols.
3. Report final results to the appropriate healthcare provider.
2. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Perform a calibration verification with each batch of
samples.
2. Include at least two levels of QC samples in each batch.
3. Document all QC results and ensure they meet
established criteria before releasing patient results.
4. If QC results are outside acceptable limits, troubleshoot
the analytical process and reanalyze affected samples.
