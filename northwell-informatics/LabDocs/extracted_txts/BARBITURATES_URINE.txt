Standard Operating Procedure for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for BARBITURATES, URINE
1. Purpose
The purpose of this Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is to
outline the process for the analytical phase of generating results for
barbiturates in urine specimens. This SOP ensures that all
procedures are conducted accurately, reliably, and consistently,
adhering to all quality and regulatory standards.
2. Responsibilities
Laboratory technologists are responsible for performing and
documenting the analysis of barbiturates in urine specimens as
outlined in this SOP. Supervisors are responsible for ensuring that all
staff follow this SOP and for addressing any issues that may affect
the quality and accuracy of test results.
3. Specimen Requirements
Preferred Specimen:
• 15-30 mL of freshly voided urine collected in a clean, dry, leak-
proof container.
• Specimens should be sent to the laboratory within 24 hours of
collection.
• If the specimen is refrigerated, it must be brought to room
temperature prior to analysis.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens arriving at the laboratory more than 24 hours after
collection.
• Specimens without collection date/time indicated on the sample
container or requisition.
4. Equipment and Reagents
• Urine specimen cups
• Calibrated Pipettes
• Centrifuge
• Immunoassay analyzer (e.g., EMIT, ELISA)
• Reagents for barbiturates detection (according to the
manufacturer's instructions)
• Internal controls and calibrators
5. Procedure
A. Preparation:
1. Bring the urine specimen to room temperature if it has been
refrigerated.
2. Perform a visual inspection of the specimen for any signs of
contamination or particulate matter. If contamination is present,
reject the specimen.
B. Centrifugation:
1. Centrifuge the urine specimen at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes to
remove any particulate matter.
2. Transfer the supernatant to a clean test tube, avoiding
disturbance of any sediment.
C. Analysis:
1. Ensure that the immunoassay analyzer and reagents are
properly calibrated and verified according to the manufacturer's
guidelines.
2. Pipette the required volume of urine (e.g., 50-100 µL) into the
designated wells of the assay plate or tube.
3. Add the reagents for barbiturates detection as per the
manufacturer's instructions.
4. Follow the specific assay protocol, including incubation times,
washing steps, and reading the results.
D. Quality Control:
1. Include both positive and negative controls in each run to
validate the assay.
2. Ensure that the results of internal controls are within the
acceptable range before reporting patient results.
E. Interpretation and Reporting:
1. Analyze the data generated by the immunoassay analyzer.
2. Compare the results against the calibration curve to determine
the concentration of barbiturates in the urine specimen.
3. If the results are out of the expected range or if there is any
interference, repeat the analysis or perform additional
confirmatory tests.
4. Document the results, including the specimen ID, test date,
concentration of barbiturates, and any relevant comments.
6. Reference Intervals
• Negative: No detectable barbiturates.
• Positive: Detectable concentration above the established cut-off
value (determined by the assay manufacturer).
7. Method Limitations
Refer to the specific immunoassay kit insert for details on limitations,
potential interferences, and cross-reactivity. Ensure that any out-of-
range results are thoroughly investigated and verified.
8. Quality Control
• Perform quality control checks for each batch of specimens
analyzed.
• Maintain records of control results and take corrective action if
controls fall outside acceptable limits.
9. Reporting and Documentation
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS) and
ensure all results are reviewed and verified by the technologist
prior to releasing them.
• Document any issues or deviations from the SOP and report them
to the supervisor.
10. References
• Manufacturer's product insert for the specific immunoassay kit
used.
• Laboratory internal guidelines for quality control and reporting.
Approval: This SOP must be approved by the laboratory supervisor
and reviewed annually to ensure it remains up to date with best
practices and regulatory requirements.

accurately analyze and report results for barbiturates in urine
specimens in a CLIA-certified laboratory.
