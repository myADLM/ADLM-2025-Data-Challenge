Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Barium, Serum
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the procedure for the analysis of barium in serum
using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The
protocol ensures accurate, reliable, and consistent results for barium
quantification in serum samples.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory personnel trained in ICP-MS and sample
preparation techniques are responsible for carrying out this
procedure. It is their duty to follow the instructions meticulously,
ensure proper documentation, and report any anomalies to the
supervising chemist or laboratory manager.
1. DEFINITIONS
Barium, Serum: The measurement of barium concentration present in
the serum fraction of blood samples.
ICP-MS: Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry, an
analytical technique used for elemental determinations.
1. PROCEDURE
4.1. Reagents and Supplies
• Serum samples
• Calibration standards for barium
• Internal standards (e.g., yttrium)
• Nitric acid (concentrated, trace metal grade)
• Ultrapure water (18.2 MΩ.cm resistivity)
• Certified reference material (CRM) for barium
• ICP-MS instrumentation supplies (cones, nebulizer, torch, etc.)
• Appropriate consumables for sample preparation (e.g., vials,
pipettes, tips)
4.2. Sample Preparation
1. Centrifuge serum samples at 3000 x g for 10 minutes to ensure
complete separation of serum from blood cells.
2. Pipette 0.5 mL of serum into an ICP-MS-compatible vial.
3. Add 0.5 mL of concentrated nitric acid to the serum sample to
achieve a 1:1 dilution.
4. Add 50 µL of internal standard (e.g., yttrium) to each sample.
5. Dilute the mixture to a final volume of 10 mL with ultrapure
water.
6. Mix the sample gently but thoroughly to ensure complete
homogenization.
7. Prepare calibration standards for barium in a similar matrix
(serum diluent with added nitric acid and internal standard).
4.3. Instrument Setup
1. Follow the ICP-MS manufacturer's instructions to set up the
instrument. Perform routine maintenance such as cleaning the
cones, torch, and nebulizer.
2. Calibrate the ICP-MS using the prepared barium standards.
Ensure the calibration curve is linear with a correlation
coefficient (R²) of at least 0.995.
3. Set the appropriate parameters for barium analysis, including
RF power, nebulizer gas flow, and lens settings.
4. Perform a calibration verification using a certified reference
material (CRM) to evaluate the accuracy of the calibration.
4.4. Barium Analysis
1. Load the sample vials into the ICP-MS autosampler.
2. Program the autosampler sequence to include blanks,
calibration standards, samples, and quality control samples.
3. Initiate the analysis run according to the instrument's standard
operating procedures.
4. Monitor the run and check for any instrument alerts or
deviations in performance.
4.5. Quality Control
1. Analyze a batch of samples including blanks, calibration
standards, and quality control samples (low, medium, and high
concentrations) with each run.
2. Ensure that the quality control samples fall within the
acceptable range (±10% of their certified values).
3. Re-calibrate the ICP-MS if any QC samples fall outside the
acceptable range and re-analyze the affected samples.
4.6. Data Analysis and Reporting
1. Review the generated data for accuracy and precision. Confirm
that the calibration and quality control criteria are met.
2. Calculate the concentration of barium in the serum samples
using the calibration curve.
3. Transfer the validated results to the laboratory information
system (LIS) for reporting.
4. Document any discrepancies, corrective actions, and re-
analysis data thoroughly.
5. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS
6. Handle all reagents, especially concentrated nitric acid, with
appropriate safety protocols, including wearing gloves, lab coat,
and eye protection.
7. Follow waste disposal guidelines for hazardous materials.
8. Ensure proper ventilation when using corrosive acids.

1. RECORDS
Maintain records of all analyses, including calibration data, quality
control results, and final reported barium concentrations, in
accordance with CLIA regulations and laboratory internal data
retention policies.
This SOP must be reviewed and updated annually or whenever
significant changes occur in the methodology or instrumentation.
