Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for BARLEY GRASS, IGE,
SERUM Testing
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedures for the analytical
phase of generating results for Barley Grass, IgE, Serum testing. This
includes the steps required for proper handling, processing, and
analyzing serum samples to ensure accurate and reliable results.
Responsibility:
• Trained laboratory personnel are responsible for performing the
test following this SOP.
• Supervisors are responsible for monitoring the adherence to this
SOP and providing additional training if necessary.
1. DEFINITION
Barley Grass, IgE, Serum testing is performed to detect specific IgE
antibodies against barley grass allergens in serum samples. This is
commonly used to diagnose allergic sensitivities.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies:
• ImmunoCAP or equivalent specific IgE testing device
• Serum sample (preferably collected in a serum separator tube
(SST))
• Barley Grass allergen reagent kit
• Calibrators and controls
• Micropipettes and disposable tips
• Centrifuge
• Timer
• Incubator
• Reagent reservoirs
B. Specimen Requirements and Stability:
• Preferred specimen: Fresh serum collected in a serum separator
tube (SST)
• The serum should be separated from the clot within 2 hours of
collection.
• Store serum at 2-8°C if analysis is to be performed within 7 days.
For longer storage, freeze the serum at -20°C or lower.
• Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
C. Detailed Procedure:
1. Pre-analytical checks: a. Verify patient identification on the
sample and requisition form. b. Ensure the sample meets the
requirements for volume and condition (hemolysis-free, clear
serum).
2. Sample Preparation: a. If stored frozen, thaw the serum
samples at room temperature. b. Mix serum samples well by
gentle inversion before analysis.
3. Instrumentation Setup: a. Turn on the ImmunoCAP instrument
and allow it to perform a self-check. b. Load the Barley Grass
allergen reagent kit into the appropriate reagent slots. c. Set up
calibrators and controls according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
4. Assay Procedure: a. Pipette the required volume of serum
(usually 20-50 µL) into the designated wells or sample cups. b.
Add the allergen reagent to each well containing the serum
sample. c. Follow timed incubation steps as specified by the kit
manufacturer (typically 30-60 minutes at 37°C). d. Wash the
wells using the provided wash solution to remove unbound
substances. e. Add the conjugate reagent and incubate for the
specified time. f. Perform the final wash steps. g. Add the
substrate solution and incubate for the specified time to develop
the signal. h. Stop the reaction by adding the stop solution.
5. Reading the Results: a. Measure the absorbance of each well
using the specified wavelength on the ImmunoCAP reader. b.
Analyze the data using the integrated software to determine the
concentration of specific IgE antibodies.
D. Quality Control:
1. Perform quality control checks using positive and negative
controls at the beginning of each batch.
2. Record and review control results to ensure they fall within the
acceptable range.
3. If control results are outside the acceptable range, troubleshoot,
repeat the assay, and do not release patient results until the
issue is resolved.
E. Reporting Results:
1. Review the generated data for each sample and validate the
results.
2. Report results as IU/L (International Units per liter) or as
specified by the laboratory's reporting guidelines.
3. Critical values or unexpected results must be confirmed by
repeat testing or additional methods.
4. Reference Intervals:
• Will be provided by the reagent manufacturer and should be
validated by each laboratory before implementation. Typically,
results are categorized as:
◦ Negative: <0.35 kU/L
◦ Low positive: 0.35–0.70 kU/L
◦ Moderate positive: 0.71–3.50 kU/L
◦ High positive: >3.50 kU/L
1. Method Limitations:
Refer to the ImmunoCAP allergen-specific IgE reagent kit insert for
limitations on sensitivity, specificity, and potential interferences.
1. Reporting, Review, and Verification:
2. Results are automatically transmitted to the laboratory
information system (LIS).
3. Each result must be reviewed and verified by the technologist
before being reported.
4. Ensure proper documentation of any anomalies or deviations
from standard procedures.
5. SAMPLE INTEGRITY:
6. If sample integrity is in question (e.g., hemolysis, lipemia),
consult with a supervisor before proceeding.
7. If necessary, a small aliquot can be centrifuged to check for
integrity issues.
8. Critical Results:
9. If high levels of IgE are detected, follow the laboratory's
protocol for reporting critical values to the patient's physician
immediately.
10. Document any notifications made for critical results as per
laboratory policy.
