STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP) Title: Analytical
Phase for BARLEY, IGE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE To outline the procedures for the analysis of
BARLEY, IGE, SERUM to ensure accurate, reliable, and timely
results.
2. SCOPE This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel involved in
the analysis of BARLEY, IGE, SERUM.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Laboratory Technologists are responsible for performing the
analysis.
• Laboratory Supervisors are responsible for overseeing the
procedures and ensuring compliance.
• Quality Control (QC) personnel are responsible for validating and
ensuring the integrity of the results.
1. DEFINITION BARLEY, IGE, SERUM indicates the
measurement of Immunoglobulin E specific to barley allergens
in serum samples.
2. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Immunoassay Analyzer (e.g., ImmunoCAP, ELISA, or other
validated systems)
• Reagents kits specific for BARLEY, IGE
• Reference calibrators and controls
• Serological Pipettes
• Micropipettes and tips
• Vortex mixer
• Refrigerator (2-8°C)
• Freezer (-20°C or lower for reagent storage)
• Incubator or water bath maintained at 37 ± 1°C
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY Specimen
Type: Serum
• Collect blood specimen in a plain tube without anticoagulant.
• Allow blood to clot at room temperature (15-30 minutes) and then
centrifuge for 10-15 minutes at 3000-3500 RPM.
• Aliquot serum into a labeled tube.
• Stability: Serum specimens are stable at 2-8°C for up to 7 days.
For longer storage, keep frozen at -20°C or lower.
1. PROCEDURE A. Preparation
• Ensure all equipment and reagents are within their expiration date
and have been stored appropriately.
• Ensure the analyzer has been calibrated and is functioning
properly.
B. Sample Processing
1. Thaw frozen serum specimens if necessary and vortex mix to
homogenize.
2. Load the serum specimens, calibrators, and controls into the
analyzer following the manufacturer's instructions.
C. Running the Assay
1. Set up the immunoassay analyzer as per the specific
equipment's user manual.
2. Enter necessary sample identification details into the system.
3. Load the appropriate reagent kits and specific calibrators for
BARLEY, IGE analysis.
4. Initiate the run and ensure that the analyzer is functioning
without errors.
5. The analyzer will automatically process the samples, measure
the specific IgE, and calculate results.
D. Interpretation of Results
1. Compare the control samples' values against the expected
ranges. If the controls are out of range, do not report patient
results, and investigate potential sources of error.
2. Use the reference controls and calibrators to interpret patient
results.
3. Patient results should be reviewed for consistency and
accuracy by the technologist.
4. Any excessively high or low values should be flagged and
rechecked for accuracy.
5. REPORTING RESULTS
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Results are reviewed and verified by a laboratory technologist.
• Results that fall outside normal ranges or are considered critical
values should be flagged and promptly reported to the requesting
clinician as per laboratory policy.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Daily: Run quality control samples (low, medium, and high) each
day before beginning patient testing.
• Weekly: Review accumulated QC data to monitor instrument
performance over time.
• Monthly: Perform a comprehensive review of QC data and
calibrator results.
• Follow corrective action procedures if QC results are outside
acceptable limits.
1. LIMITATIONS
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples can interfere with the
assay and should be avoided.
• Refer to the specific assay kit insert for detailed limitations related
to the immunoassay being used.
1. REFERENCES
• Immunoassay Analyzer User Manual and Manufacturer’s
Package Insert.
• CLSI Guidelines for Laboratory Testing.
1. PROCESS IMPROVEMENT
• Review SOP annually and update as necessary to incorporate
new procedures, equipment updates, or changes in regulations.
1. DOCUMENT CONTROL
• Maintain records of all performed analyses, including raw data,
worksheets, calibration records, QC logs, and maintenance logs.
This SOP is effective as of [Date], and all laboratory personnel must
comply with the instructions and procedures detailed herein.
