Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase of Generating Results for BARLEY IGG
1. PURPOSE
To outline procedures for the analysis and generation of results for
Barley IgG testing within the clinical laboratory setting. This document
details the steps to ensure accurate, reliable, and timely reporting of
Barley IgG levels in patient specimens.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing
Barley IgG testing according to this SOP.
• All staff must be aware of their roles in the identification,
documentation, and correction of any deviations or issues
affecting test results.
2. DEFINITION
Barley IgG: Immunoglobulin G antibodies specific to barley proteins,
used to diagnose allergic or immune responses to barley.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND HANDLING
Preferred Specimen:
• Serum obtained from blood collected in a standard serum
separator tube (SST).
Acceptable Specimen:
• Plasma obtained from blood collected in an EDTA or heparin tube
if serum is unavailable.
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
• Samples not properly labeled or lacking pertinent collection
information.
Specimen Stability:
• Room Temperature: 24 hours
• Refrigerated (2-8°C): 7 days
• Frozen (-20°C or below): 6 months
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Centrifuge
• ELISA (Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay) Reader
• Incubator (37°C)
Reagents:
• Barley IgG ELISA Kit (includes standard controls, enzyme
conjugates, substrate solution, wash buffer, and stop solution)
• Calibrators
• Quality Control materials (positive and negative controls)
Supplies:
• Micropipettes and tips
• 96-well microtiter plates
• Plate washer
• Plate sealers
Storage:
• Store reagents as per manufacturer’s guidelines, usually at 2-8°C.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
Materials:
• Positive and negative control sera
Procedure:
• Perform quality control testing with each run of patient specimens.
• Document control results to ensure they fall within accepted
ranges.
• Investigate and correct any control failures before proceeding with
patient sample analysis.
6. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Bring all reagents and samples to room temperature prior to
beginning the assay.
2. Label microtiter plate wells for standards, controls, and patient
samples.
Assay Procedure:
1. Pipette standards, controls, and patient samples into assigned
wells (usually 100 µL per well).
2. Incubate the plate for the time specified by the manufacturer
(usually 30-60 minutes at 37°C).
3. Wash the plate according to the kit instructions (typically 3-5
washes with provided wash buffer).
4. Add enzyme conjugate to each well and incubate as specified.
5. Rewash the plate similarly.
6. Add substrate solution and incubate until the desired color
change occurs.
7. Stop the reaction using the stop solution.
8. Read absorbance at the specified wavelength (typically 450
nm) using an ELISA reader.
7. INTERPRETATION AND REPORTING OF RESULTS
Calculations:
1. Construct a standard curve by plotting the absorbance of the
standards against their concentrations.
2. Determine the concentration of Barley IgG in patient samples
by comparing their absorbance to the standard curve.
Reference Range:
• Negative: < X U/mL
• Equivocal: X to Y U/mL
• Positive: > Y U/mL (Replace X and Y with specific values provided
by the kit insert).
Report Results:
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Positive/Equivocal results may require follow-up testing or clinical
correlation by the physician.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the manufacturer’s instructions for specific limitations.
Common limitations include:
• Cross-reactivity with other cereal proteins.
• Potential interference from hemolysis, lipemia, or icterus in
samples.
9. TROUBLESHOOTING AND CORRECTIVE ACTIONS
If Controls Fail:
• Reassess reagent preparation and storage.
• Check equipment calibration and functionality.
• Repeat the assay with fresh controls and patient samples.
Documentation:
• Record each step of the procedure, including any deviations and
corrective actions taken.
