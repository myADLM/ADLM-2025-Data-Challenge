Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Bartonella Antibody
Panel, IFA CSF
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the accurate and efficient
performance of the Bartonella Antibody Panel using Indirect
Fluorescent Antibody (IFA) assay in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
specimens to ensure reliable and reproducible results.
2. SPECIMEN
Preferred/acceptable:
• 1-2 mL cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) obtained via lumbar puncture,
collected in a sterile, leak-proof container.
• Specimen should be transported to the laboratory immediately
after collection.
• Specimen must be processed within 24 hours; if not possible,
store at 2-8°C and process within 48 hours.
Unacceptable:
• Specimens with significant hemolysis or contamination.
• Specimens received in improper container or without proper
labeling.
• Specimens received beyond the 48-hour window without
refrigeration.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Bartonella IFA slides
• Fluorescein-conjugated anti-human immunoglobulin G (IgG) and
immunoglobulin M (IgM)
• PBS (Phosphate-Buffered Saline), pH 7.2
• Mounting medium
• Coverslips
• Fluorescence microscope
• Micropipettes and tips
• Humid chamber
• Timer
• Positive and negative control samples
4. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation of reagents and controls:
• Prepare PBS wash buffer.
• Ensure that the positive and negative control samples are ready
for use.
• Lay out all necessary IFA slides and label them appropriately.
B. Sample Preparation:
1. Thaw CSF samples and control reagents to room temperature if
previously refrigerated.
2. Vortex each CSF specimen gently to obtain a homogeneous
sample.
3. Pipette 10 µL of CSF onto the designated well of the IFA slide.
C. IFA Assay:
1. Incubate the IFA slide in a humid chamber for 30 minutes at
room temperature to allow the antibodies in the sample to bind
to the antigen on the slide.
2. Rinse the IFA slide gently with PBS to remove unbound
material.
3. Incubate the slide with fluorescein-conjugated anti-human IgG
and IgM for 30 minutes in a humid chamber at room
temperature.
4. Rinse the slide with PBS again to remove excess conjugate.
D. Slide Preparation and Observation:
1. Add a small drop of mounting medium to each well.
2. Carefully place coverslips over each well to avoid air bubbles.
3. Observe the slides under a fluorescence microscope with
appropriate filters.
E. Interpretation of Results:
1. Read and interpret fluorescence patterns in comparison to
positive and negative control wells.
2. Report results as positive or negative for Bartonella IgG and
IgM antibodies based on the presence or absence of specific
fluorescence.
3. Record fluorescence intensity when applicable.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
• Analyze one positive and one negative control sample alongside
patient samples during each run.
• If control results are not as expected, do not report patient results
and troubleshoot potential assay issues.
• Document all quality control results in the laboratory logbook.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
• Positive results indicate the presence of Bartonella-specific
antibodies in the CSF.
• Negative results indicate the absence of detectable Bartonella-
specific antibodies in the CSF.
• All results should be reviewed and verified by a qualified
technologist before reporting to the clinician.
7. LIMITATIONS
• False-negative results may occur if the antibody concentration is
below the detection limit of the assay.
• False-positive results may occur due to cross-reactivity with other
antigens.
• Interpretation should be made with clinical correlation.
