Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase:
Bartonella Antibody Panel, IgG and IgM, Serum
1. PURPOSE: To outline the procedure for the analytical phase of
generating and validating test results for Bartonella antibody
panel, IgG and IgM, serum.
2. SCOPE: This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel who
are responsible for performing the Bartonella antibody panel,
including IgG and IgM, on serum specimens.
3. RESPONSIBILITY: It is the responsibility of the trained
laboratory personnel to follow the procedures outlined in this
SOP to ensure accurate and reliable results. The laboratory
supervisor shall ensure compliance with this SOP and address
any deficiencies.
4. SPECIMEN:
• Preferred/acceptable:
◦ 2 mL of serum collected in a red-top or serum separator tube
(SST)
◦ Serum should be separated from cells within 2 hours of
collection
◦ Store and transport at 2-8°C if analysis is delayed; stability at
2-8°C is up to 7 days
• Unacceptable:
◦ Specimens that are hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric
◦ Specimens collected in non-acceptable tubes such as EDTA or
heparin
◦ Specimens that have not been appropriately labeled or have
discrepancies in identification
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES:
• ELISA reader (e.g., Thermo Fisher Multiskan FC)
• Incubator set at 37°C
• Microplate washer
• Pipettes and disposable tips
• Calibrators, controls, and reagents as specified in the kit insert
• Bartonella IgG and IgM ELISA kits (e.g., Zeus Scientific)
• Certified timers
• Protective gear (gloves, lab coat, eye protection)
1. PROCEDURE: Note: Always refer to the specific product insert
for calibration protocols and reagent preparation.
A. Preparation:
1. Allow all reagents, controls, and serum samples to reach room
temperature and gently mix.
2. Set up the ELISA reader with the appropriate settings as
specified by the kit insert.
B. Assay Procedure:
1. Pipette appropriate controls and patient serum samples (diluted
according to kit instructions) into designated wells of the
microplate.
2. Add diluted conjugate reagent to each well as directed by the
kit insert.
3. Incubate the plate at 37°C for the specified duration (e.g., 30
minutes).
4. Wash wells thoroughly using the microplate washer according
to the kit insert instructions.
5. Add substrate solution to each well, and incubate at room
temperature in the dark for the time specified in the kit insert.
6. Add stop solution to each well to terminate the reaction.
7. Immediately read the optical density (OD) of each well at the
specified wavelength (e.g., 450 nm with a 650 nm reference
filter) using the ELISA reader.
C. Interpretation:
1. Calculate the mean OD for calibrators and controls.
2. Construct a standard curve as described in the kit insert.
3. Determine the concentration of IgG and IgM antibodies in
patient samples by comparing the OD values with the standard
curve.
4. Interpret the results based on the criteria provided in the kit
insert.
5. QUALITY CONTROL:
• Run positive and negative controls with each batch of tests.
• Ensure that control results are within the acceptable range
specified by the manufacturer.
• Document all control results, and do not release patient results
until controls are confirmed as valid.
1. REPORTING RESULTS:
• Record results in the laboratory information system (LIS) as
specified by laboratory policies.
• Ensure proper review and verification of the results by the
technologist before releasing results.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS:
• Refer to the kit insert for the expected reference ranges for IgG
and IgM.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
• Refer to the product insert for any limitations or interferences that
may affect the results.

• SOP Version 1.0 (Month/Year)
• Reviewed/Revised (Month/Year) by (Name/Title)
By following these steps, accurate and reliable results for the
Bartonella antibody panel, IgG and IgM, serum can be obtained,
ensuring timely and effective diagnosis and treatment for patients.
