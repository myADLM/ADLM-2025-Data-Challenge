Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for BARTONELLA, MOLECULAR
DETECTION, PCR, BLOOD
1. PURPOSE
To outline the protocol for the analytical phase of Bartonella DNA
detection in blood samples using Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)
in a CLIA-certified laboratory. This procedure ensures accurate and
reliable detection of Bartonella DNA in blood specimens.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing
the Bartonella PCR assay.
• It is the responsibility of all laboratory personnel to follow this SOP
to ensure accurate and reliable test results.
1. PRINCIPLE
PCR is a molecular technique used to amplify specific DNA
sequences. This protocol details the steps for the amplification and
detection of Bartonella species DNA in blood samples.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred Specimen: Whole blood collected in EDTA tubes.
• Specimen Stability: Specimens should be stored at 2-8°C and
processed within 48 hours of collection. If delayed, specimens
can be stored at -20°C for up to one week.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Thermocycler/PCR machine
• Microcentrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Micropipettes and sterile pipette tips with aerosol barriers
• DNA extraction kit
• PCR master mix
• Bartonella-specific primers and probes
• Nuclease-free water
• Positive and negative control samples
• DNAse/RNAse-free tubes
• PCR reaction tubes/plates
1. PROCEDURE
A. DNA Extraction:
1. Sample Preparation:
◦ Mix the blood sample thoroughly by gentle inversion.
◦ Transfer the required volume (as per the DNA extraction kit
protocol) into a sterile, DNAse/RNAse-free microcentrifuge
tube.
2. DNA Extraction:
◦ Follow the manufacturer’s instructions of the DNA extraction
kit to isolate genomic DNA from the blood sample.
◦ Elute the DNA in the appropriate buffer or nuclease-free
water.
◦ Quantitate the DNA concentration and evaluate purity (if
required).
B. PCR Setup:
1. Preparation:
◦ Prepare the PCR master mix following the reagent
specifications, including the Bartonella-specific primers and
probes.
◦ Aliquot the master mix into PCR reaction tubes/plates.
2. Addition of Template DNA:
◦ Add the extracted DNA (template) to the PCR reaction
tubes/plates containing the master mix.
◦ Include positive and negative control samples to validate the
PCR run.
3. Thermocycling:
◦ Place the PCR reaction tubes/plates in the thermocycler.
◦ Program the thermocycler as per the Bartonella PCR assay
protocol, which typically includes initial denaturation,
followed by cycles of denaturation, annealing, and
extension, and a final extension step.
C. Detection and Analysis:
1. Amplification Detection:
◦ Post-PCR, analyze the PCR products using the appropriate
detection method such as gel electrophoresis or a real-time
PCR detection system.
2. Interpretation of Results:
◦ Compare the amplification curves and signal intensities of
the samples to the positive and negative controls.
◦ A positive result for Bartonella DNA is indicated by the
presence of specific amplification at the expected size for
the target sequence.
◦ A negative result indicates no amplification of the target
sequence.
3. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run positive and negative controls with each batch of samples to
ensure the reliability of the PCR results.
• Document all control results and take appropriate corrective
actions if controls do not perform as expected.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Record all results in the laboratory information system (LIS).
• Results must be reviewed and verified by a qualified technologist
before being reported.
• Positive results for Bartonella DNA should be reported promptly to
the requesting physician to ensure timely clinical intervention.
• Include appropriate comments or disclaimers if any issues with
sample integrity or assay performance are identified.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• The reference interval for this assay is qualitative: Positive or
Negative for Bartonella DNA presence.
1. LIMITATIONS
• Results are dependent on the quality of the sample and
adherence to the procedure.
• False negatives may occur if the sample contains inhibitors or if
the DNA extraction is incomplete.
• The assay is specific for Bartonella species; cross-reactivity with
other organisms is minimal based on the specificity of the primers
and probes used.

reagents.

specific primers and probes.
