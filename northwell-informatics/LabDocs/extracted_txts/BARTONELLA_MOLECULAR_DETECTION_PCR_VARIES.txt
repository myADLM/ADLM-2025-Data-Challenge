Standard Operating Procedure BARTONELLA, MOLECULAR
DETECTION, PCR, VARIES
1. PURPOSE This procedure outlines the steps for the detection
of Bartonella species DNA in patient specimens using the
Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) method. The aim is to
provide accurate and reliable identification of Bartonella
infections for diagnostic purposes.
2. RESPONSIBILITY Qualified laboratory personnel are
responsible for performing and documenting the procedure. The
laboratory supervisor ensures compliance with the procedure
and oversees corrective actions, if necessary.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS 3.1 Preferred/Acceptable
Specimens: Whole blood, serum, or tissue that has been
appropriately collected and stored. 3.2 Unacceptable
Specimens: Specimens that are hemolyzed, stored incorrectly,
contaminated, or collected more than 7 days before testing.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES 4.1 Equipment •
PCR thermal cycler • Microcentrifuge • Vortex mixer • Pipettes
and tips (aerosol-resistant) • Nucleic acid quantification
instrument 4.2 Reagents • PCR Master Mix • Bartonella-specific
primers and probes • Nuclease-free water • Positive control
DNA (Bartonella spp.) • Negative control (nuclease-free water)
4.3 Supplies • Microcentrifuge tubes • PCR strips or plates •
Gloves and lab coats
5. PROCEDURE 5.1 Sample Preparation • Label microcentrifuge
tubes with patient identifiers. • Extract DNA from the specimen
using a suitable extraction kit, following the manufacturer’s
instructions. • Quantify and assess the purity of extracted DNA
using a nucleic acid quantification instrument.
5.2 PCR Master Mix Preparation • Prepare the PCR Master Mix
on ice. The master mix should contain the following per
reaction: - PCR buffer (1X final concentration) - MgCl2 (1.5–3.0
mM, as per optimization) - dNTPs (200 μM each) - Forward
primer (0.2–0.5 μM) - Reverse primer (0.2–0.5 μM) - Probe
(0.1–0.2 μM) - Taq DNA polymerase (x U/μL, per
manufacturer’s instructions) - Nuclease-free water to final
volume.
5.3 Reaction Assembly • Aliquot the appropriate volume of PCR
Master Mix into each PCR tube/plate well. • Add extracted DNA
sample (x μL) to the respective tubes/wells. • Include positive
control with known Bartonella DNA and negative control with
nuclease-free water in each run.
5.4 PCR Amplification • Place the tubes/plate in the thermal
cycler and run the following program: - Initial denaturation: 95°C
for 5 minutes - Denaturation: 95°C for 30 seconds - Annealing/
extension: 58–60°C for 30 seconds (40 cycles) - Final
extension: 72°C for 5 minutes - Hold: 4°C (until further
processing)
5.5 Post-PCR Analysis • Analyze amplification data using the
thermal cycler software. • Assess positive reactions based on
the presence of a specific amplification curve corresponding to
the Bartonella probe.
6. QUALITY CONTROL • Run a positive control (Bartonella DNA)
and a negative control (nuclease-free water) with each batch of
patient samples. • Ensure that the positive control shows
amplification and the negative control does not show any
amplification.
7. REPORTING RESULTS • Report results as either "Detected" or
"Not Detected" based on the presence or absence of the
amplification curve. • Results must be reviewed and verified by
the supervising technologist. • For invalid results, repeat the
analysis following the outlined protocol.
8. CRITICAL ACTIONS • Notify the supervisor immediately if
contamination is suspected or if controls do not perform as
expected. • Document any discrepancies or deviations from the
protocol along with corrective actions taken.
9. REFERENCES • Manufacturer’s instructions for DNA extraction
and PCR kit. • Relevant laboratory safety and standard
operating procedures. • Clinical guidelines on Bartonella
infection and PCR-based diagnostics.
