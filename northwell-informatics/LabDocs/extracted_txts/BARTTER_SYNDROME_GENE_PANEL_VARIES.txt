Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Generating Results for
Bartter Syndrome Gene Panel
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedures and responsibilities for testing, analyzing,
and reporting results for the Bartter Syndrome Gene Panel to ensure
accurate and reliable genetic analysis.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel involved in the
analytical phase of the Bartter Syndrome Gene Panel test.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• It is the responsibility of the laboratory personnel to follow this
SOP and to report any issues or deviations to the laboratory
supervisor.
• The laboratory supervisor is responsible for ensuring adherence
to this SOP and making any necessary corrective actions.
4. DEFINITION
Bartter Syndrome is a group of rare inherited hyperkalemic renal
tubular disorders. The Bartter Syndrome Gene Panel includes
sequencing of the genes known to be associated with this condition.
5. SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS
Follow all institutional safety guidelines including the use of personal
protective equipment (PPE), proper waste disposal, and equipment
handling protocols.
6. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Sequencing equipment (e.g., Illumina MiSeq or equivalent)
• PCR reagents (e.g., DNA polymerase, dNTPs, primers)
• DNA extraction kits
• Nucleic acid quantification equipment (e.g., NanoDrop
Spectrophotometer)
• Quality control materials (e.g., positive control samples, negative
control samples)
• Bioinformatics tools
7. PROCEDURE
7.1 DNA Extraction:
1. Extract genomic DNA from the received specimen using a
designated DNA extraction kit.
2. Follow the manufacturer’s protocol for the extraction process.
3. Quantify and assess the quality of the extracted DNA using a
spectrophotometer or fluorometer.
4. Document DNA concentration and purity (A260/280 ratio) in the
laboratory information system (LIS).
7.2 PCR Amplification:
1. Prepare the PCR master mix, including DNA polymerase,
dNTPs, and gene-specific primers.
2. Aliquot the PCR master mix into PCR tubes or a 96-well plate
as required.
3. Add the genomic DNA sample to the individual tubes/wells.
4. Include positive control DNA and a no-template (negative)
control in the PCR setup.
5. Perform PCR amplification following thermal cycling parameters
specified by the kit manufacturer or laboratory-validated
protocol.
7.3 Quality Control of PCR Products:
1. Run an aliquot of the PCR product on an agarose gel
electrophoresis to confirm successful amplification.
2. Verify the size of the PCR product against a DNA ladder.
3. Record the results of the gel electrophoresis in the LIS.
7.4 Library Preparation and Sequencing:
1. Prepare sequencing libraries from the PCR products using an
appropriate sequencing library preparation kit.
2. Quantify and normalize the library input before loading onto the
sequencing platform.
3. Load the libraries into the sequencing equipment and start the
sequencing run.
7.5 Data Analysis:
1. Use bioinformatics tools to align sequencing reads to the
reference genome and call variants.
2. Filter and annotate variants, focusing specifically on genes
associated with Bartter Syndrome.
3. Cross-reference detected variants with known databases (e.g.,
ClinVar, HGMD) for clinical significance.
7.6 Interpretation and Reporting:
1. A clinical geneticist or trained laboratory personnel will review
the data and interpret the detected variants.
2. Generate a comprehensive report including methods, variants
identified, and clinical significance.
3. Follow institutional guidelines for result verification and
validation before reporting.
7.7 Document Control:
1. Ensure all steps are documented in the laboratory information
system.
2. Maintain records of all consumables, reagents, equipment
used, and quality control measures.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Perform quality control checks at each critical step (DNA
extraction, PCR amplification, library preparation, and
sequencing).
2. Include both positive and negative controls to ensure accuracy.
3. Address any control failures by investigating potential causes,
implementing necessary corrective actions, and re-running the
affected samples.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Results will be reviewed and approved by a designated
laboratory supervisor or clinical geneticist.
2. Report final results to the requesting healthcare provider with
appropriate interpretation.
3. Ensure timely communication of urgent or clinically significant
findings.
10. REFERENCE
• Manufacturer’s manuals for DNA extraction kits, PCR reagents,
sequencing equipment, and bioinformatics tools.
• Clinical references for Bartter Syndrome genes and variant
databases (e.g., ClinVar, HGMD).
11. REVIEW AND APPROVAL
This SOP is to be reviewed annually and updated as necessary to
reflect changes in technology, methods, or regulatory guidelines.
