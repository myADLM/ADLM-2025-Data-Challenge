STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP) Title: Analytical
Phase of Generating Results for Basic Metabolic Panel (BMP)
1. PURPOSE
To provide standardized procedures for the analysis and reporting of
the Basic Metabolic Panel (BMP) tests in the laboratory.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all designated laboratory personnel
responsible for performing BMP assays, including handling,
processing, and reporting results.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
All designated laboratory staff are responsible for conducting BMP
testing per this SOP, including verifying results and ensuring quality
control.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred Specimen: Serum collected in a gold-top serum
separator tube (SST).
• Acceptable Specimen: Serum or plasma collected in green-top
(heparin) tubes.
• Unacceptable Specimen: Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric
specimens may be rejected as they can interfere with test results.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Automated Chemistry Analyzer
• Calibrators and Controls
• Reagents specifically intended for BMP testing
• Disposable pipettes, gloves, and other PPE
• Centrifuge
6. PROCEDURE
Preparation of Specimen:
• Serum/Plasma Separation: Allow the blood specimen collected
in SST to clot completely before centrifugation. Centrifuge the
specimen to obtain clear serum/plasma.
• Storage: If not analyzed immediately, store the serum/plasma at
2-8°C for up to 24 hours. For longer storage, freeze at -20°C or
lower.
Loading and Calibration of Analyzer:
• Self-check the chemistry analyzer following the manufacturer's
instructions.
• Load the reagents, calibrators, and controls.
• Calibrate the analyzer using the designated calibrators.
• Run quality control samples at the beginning of each shift, after
servicing the analyzer, after changing reagent lots, and as
indicated by quality control policy.
Running BMP Assays:
• Loading Samples: Load patient specimens into the designated
sample holder for the chemistry analyzer.
• Initiating Run: Follow the analyzer's setup instructions to initiate
BMP assay. Ensure that each sample is accurately identified
during loading.
Analyzing Results:
• Verification: Each analyte's result should be automatically
evaluated against quality control data.
• Critical Values: Values falling out of the expected ranges must be
immediately rechecked, and in the case they are confirmed,
reported to the attending physician or clinical team immediately.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform quality control testing using commercial control materials
at least once per 8-hour shift, prior to start of patient assays.
• Review QC data, ensuring all controls fall within the acceptable
range. Do not proceed with patient testing if QC fails.
8. REPORTING AND DOCUMENTATION
• Results are transmitted electronically to the Laboratory
Information System (LIS) upon completion of the run.
• Review and verify each result before finalizing the report. Cross-
check patient identifiers.
• Document any deviations, equipment malfunctions, or corrective
actions taken during the process in the maintenance logs.
9. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Basic Metabolic Panel includes:
• Glucose: 70-110 mg/dl
• Calcium: 8.5-10.2 mg/dl
• Sodium: 135-145 mmol/L
• Potassium: 3.5-5.1 mmol/L
• CO2 (Bicarbonate): 23-29 mmol/L
• Chloride: 96-106 mmol/L
• Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN): 7-18 mg/dl
• Creatinine: 0.6-1.2 mg/dl
10. LIMITATIONS OF THE METHOD
• Refer to specific regent kit inserts and the analyzer's user manual
for limitations.
• Lipemic, hemolyzed, or icteric samples may interfere with BMP
test results.
11. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's instructions for the chemistry analyzer
• Package inserts for BMP reagents
• Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines
12. REVIEW AND REVISION
This protocol has been reviewed by the laboratory management. It
will be reviewed on an annual basis or whenever significant changes
are needed.
