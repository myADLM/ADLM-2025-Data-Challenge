Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Basic Metabolic Panel Plus Glucose (BMP
Plus Glucose)
1. PURPOSE:
This SOP outlines the procedure for performing and generating
results for the Basic Metabolic Panel Plus Glucose (BMP Plus
Glucose). The BMP Plus Glucose test includes the analysis of
essential metabolites and electrolytes to evaluate general body
metabolism, kidney function, and glucose levels. The consistency in
the analytical process ensures precise test results and reliable
patient diagnoses.
Responsibility: It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory
technologists to follow the procedures detailed below to ensure the
accuracy and reliability of the BMP Plus Glucose assay.
1. POLICY:
Qualified technical personnel will perform the BMP Plus Glucose
assay, interpret results, conduct quality control measures, and report
findings. Laboratory staff must be adequately trained and
demonstrate competency in performing the assay as part of
laboratory safety and accrediting requirements.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS:
• Automated chemistry analyzer (e.g., Roche Cobas, Abbott
Architect, Beckman Coulter AU)
• Calibrators and controls specific to the analyzer
• Reagents specific to the analyzer
• Specimen collection tubes: SST (serum separator tube) or PST
(plasma separator tube)
• Quality control materials
• Deionized water
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS:
• Serum or plasma samples collected in an SST or PST tube.
• A minimum volume of 1 mL of serum or plasma required for
accurate testing.
• Specimens must be thoroughly mixed and free from hemolysis.
• Centrifuge specimens to separate serum/plasma from cells within
2 hours of collection.
• Properly label specimens with the patient’s identifier, collection
date, and time.
1. PROCEDURE:
A) Pre-Analytical Preparations:
• Verify all reagents and controls are within their expiration date and
stored appropriately.
• Ensure calibration of instruments is up to date using
manufacturer’s guidelines.
• Perform routine maintenance on the chemistry analyzer as
required.
B) Sample Loading:
• Allow serum/plasma samples to come to room temperature.
• Inspect samples for hemolysis, lipemia, or icterus, which may
interfere with test results.
• Load the patient samples, calibration standards, and quality
control materials onto the chemistry analyzer. Ensure proper
placement and identify potential carry-over or contamination.
C) Instrument Setup:
• Select the specific BMP Plus Glucose assay panel on the
laboratory management system.
• Verify the instrument parameters are correctly set according to
assay requirements.
• Use the appropriate sample cups or racks as required by the
analyzer.
D) Running the Assay:
• Initiate the analysis on the instrument as per the manufacturer’s
instructions.
• Allow the instrument to perform the assay, which includes
sampling, reagent addition, incubation, measurement, and result
calculation.
• Monitor the assay run for any flagged issues or alerts from the
instrumentation.
E) Result Analysis:
• Once the assay is complete, review the results for anomalies or
errors.
• Verify quality control data to confirm the assay's accuracy. Assess
control results against acceptable ranges.
• Address any out-of-range or flagged QC results following the lab’s
corrective action protocol prior to releasing patient results.
• If necessary, re-run the assay or perform dilution steps per
manufacturer’s instructions for overly concentrated specimens.
1. RESULTS REPORTING:
• Validate results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS). Check
for clerical errors, and correlate results with the patient’s clinical
condition for any discrepancies.
• Report BMP Plus Glucose values include: -- Sodium (Na): 135 –
145 mEq/L -- Potassium (K): 3.5 – 5.0 mEq/L -- Chloride (Cl): 98 –
107 mEq/L -- Bicarbonate (HCO3-): 22 – 29 mEq/L -- Blood Urea
Nitrogen (BUN): 6 – 20 mg/dL -- Creatinine (Cr): 0.6 – 1.2 mg/dL
-- Glucose (Glu): 70 – 99 mg/dL (fasting) -- Calcium (Ca): 8.5 –
10.2 mg/dL
• Record results noting any critical values which should be flagged
and reported immediately to the clinician following lab policy.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
Refer to the test kit insert for specific limitations, interferences, and
performance characteristics provided by the reagent and instrument
manufacturers.
1. QUALITY CONTROL:
• Perform quality control for each batch/run of assays and
document the outcomes.
• Use multi-level controls to cover the clinical range of analytes.
• Address QC data that falls outside the acceptance criteria,
perform corrective actions, and re-run controls when needed.
1. SAFETY AND WASTE DISPOSAL:
• Follow proper laboratory safety guidelines for handling human
specimens and reagents.
• Dispose of all waste materials, including sharps and biological
waste, according to laboratory waste disposal protocols.

• Manufacturer's instructions and instrument operation manuals.
• Relevant CLSI guidelines.
