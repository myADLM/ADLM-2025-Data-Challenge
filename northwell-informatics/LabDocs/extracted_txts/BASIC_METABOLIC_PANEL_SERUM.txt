Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Basic Metabolic Panel,
Serum
Purpose: The purpose of this SOP is to define the procedures for the
analytical phase of generating results for a Basic Metabolic Panel
(BMP) in serum. This panel includes the following tests: Glucose,
Calcium, Sodium, Potassium, Bicarbonate, Chloride, Blood Urea
Nitrogen (BUN), and Creatinine. This SOP ensures that all tests are
performed in a consistent and standardized manner to ensure the
accuracy and reliability of test results.
Specimen: Preferred/acceptable:
• Serum: 5 mL blood collected in a gold top (serum separator) tube.
Serum should be separated from cells within 2 hours of collection
to prevent hemolysis and preserve the integrity of the analytes.
Unacceptable:
• Specimens collected in tubes other than gold top serum separator
tubes.
• Specimens with visible hemolysis, lipemia, or icterus.
• Specimens received more than 8 hours after collection if not
refrigerated properly.
• Specimens with no collection date/time indicated on the sample
container or requisition.
Equipment, Reagents and Supplies:
• Automated chemistry analyzer (e.g., Roche Cobas 8000)
• Calibrators and controls specific to the chemistry analyzer
• Appropriate reagents for each analyte tested in the BMP
• Pipettes and tips
• Centrifuge
Procedure:
1. Specimen Processing:
◦ Check specimen for acceptability based on the criteria
outlined above.
◦ Ensure the serum is free from visible hemolysis, lipemia, or
icterus.
◦ Transfer the serum into an appropriately labeled sample cup
for the analyzer.
2. Calibration and Quality Control:
◦ Perform initial calibration of the analyzer using
manufacturer-provided calibrators.
◦ Run quality control (QC) materials at two levels (normal and
abnormal) at the beginning of each shift, after calibration,
and any time there is a change in reagents or significant
maintenance performed on the analyzer.
◦ Document QC results and compare to the established
control limits. If QC results are out of range, troubleshoot
according to the analyzer's manual before proceeding with
patient samples.
3. Analyte Measurement: a. Glucose: - Load appropriate
reagents into the analyzer. - Perform the glucose test according
to the analyzer's instructions. - Result expected range: 70–110
mg/dL
b. Calcium: - Load appropriate reagents into the analyzer. -
Perform the calcium test according to the analyzer's
instructions. - Result expected range: 8.5–10.2 mg/dL
c. Sodium: - Load appropriate reagents into the analyzer. -
Perform the sodium test according to the analyzer's
instructions. - Result expected range: 135–145 mmol/L
d. Potassium: - Load appropriate reagents into the analyzer. -
Perform the potassium test according to the analyzer's
instructions. - Result expected range: 3.5–5.0 mmol/L
e. Bicarbonate: - Load appropriate reagents into the analyzer.
- Perform the bicarbonate test according to the analyzer's
instructions. - Result expected range: 22–28 mmol/L
f. Chloride: - Load the appropriate reagents into the analyzer. -
Perform the chloride test according to the analyzer's
instructions. - Result expected range: 98–107 mmol/L
g. Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN): - Load appropriate reagents
into the analyzer. - Perform the BUN test according to the
analyzer's instructions. - Result expected range: 7–20 mg/dL
h. Creatinine: - Load appropriate reagents into the analyzer. -
Perform the creatinine test according to the analyzer's
instructions. - Result expected range: 0.6–1.2 mg/dL
4. Reporting Results:
◦ Review each analyte result for consistency and accuracy
before verifying them for reporting.
◦ Address any flagged results or analyzer-generated error
messages immediately, following the analyzer's
troubleshooting guide.
◦ Document any unusual occurrences (e.g., Delta checks)
and take appropriate corrective actions.
◦ Enter the verified results into the Laboratory Information
System (LIS) for reporting to the healthcare provider.
5. Critical Results:
◦ Critical values must be reported immediately to the
requesting physician or healthcare provider.
◦ Document all critical values, including the date, time, and
person notified in the laboratory records.
◦ Follow department-specific guidelines for repeat testing of
critical values to confirm results.
6. Method Limitations:
◦ Recognize any interferences or limitations associated with
each assay, as outlined in the reagent insert or instrument
manual.
◦ Ensure any compromised samples are recollected and
analyzed accordingly.
7. Quality Assurance:
◦ Continually monitor the performance of the test procedures
and instruments through proficiency testing, internal audits,
and external reviews.
◦ Participate in a laboratory proficiency testing program to
ensure consistent and accurate results.
8. References:
◦ Manufacturer's instruction manual for the chemistry
analyzer.
◦ Reagent inserts for each analyte.
◦ CLSI guidelines and quality control procedures.
Note: This protocol must be reviewed annually and revised as
necessary to comply with the latest laboratory standards and
regulatory requirements.
