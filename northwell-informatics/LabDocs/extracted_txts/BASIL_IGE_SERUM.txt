Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase:
Generating Results for BASIL, IGE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE:
To outline the procedures involved in the analytical phase for
the accurate determination and reporting of BASIL, IGE, and
SERUM levels in patient specimens.
2. SCOPE:
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel trained and
authorized to perform BASIL, IGE, and SERUM testing in the
laboratory.
3. REAGENTS & EQUIPMENT:
◦ BASIL reagent kit
◦ Total IgE reagent kit
◦ Serum chemistry reagent panel
◦ Automated Immunoassay Analyzer
◦ Calibrators and controls appropriate for the assays
◦ Specimen collection materials including serum separator
tubes (SST)
◦ Sample cups and pipettes
◦ Computer and Laboratory Information System (LIS)
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS:
Preferred/Acceptable Specimens:
◦ BASIL: Blood collected in SST. Separate serum from cells
as soon as possible, preferably within 2 hours of collection.
Store serum at 2-8°C if assay is to be performed within 48
hours; otherwise, freeze at -20°C.
◦ IGE: Blood collected in SST. Separate serum from cells
promptly. Store serum at 2-8°C if assay is to be performed
within 7 days; otherwise, freeze at -20°C.
◦ SERUM: Blood collected in SST. Separate serum as soon
as possible. Store at 2-8°C if assay is to be performed within
8 hours; otherwise, freeze at -20°C.
Unacceptable Specimens:
◦ Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric specimens
◦ Specimens collected in anticoagulant tubes (e.g., EDTA,
heparin)
◦ Any specimen that has been subjected to repeated freeze-
thaw cycles
5. PROCEDURE:
Preparation:
◦ Ensure reagents and control materials are at room
temperature.
◦ Calibrate the automated immunoassay analyzer according
to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Sample Preparation:
◦ Allow serum specimens to come to room temperature
unless otherwise specified.
◦ Load calibrators, controls, and patient specimens onto the
analyzer, following the manufacturer’s instructions.
Assay Procedure:
◦ For BASIL:
1. Load the BASIL reagent kit onto the analyzer.
2. Run appropriate calibrators and controls.
3. Program and start the assay on the analyzer
according to the BASIL reagent kit insert.
◦ For IGE:
1. Load the Total IgE reagent kit onto the analyzer.
2. Run appropriate calibrators and controls.
3. Follow the assay procedures as per the IgE reagent kit
insert.
◦ For SERUM:
1. Load the serum chemistry panel reagents onto the
analyzer.
2. Run appropriate calibrators and controls.
3. Follow the assay procedures specific to each serum
chemistry test.
6. QUALITY CONTROL:
◦ Run quality control samples at the beginning of each assay
batch, after any maintenance, and whenever reagents are
changed.
◦ Ensure that the control results fall within the established
range before proceeding with patient specimens.
◦ Document all QC results in the laboratory's quality control
log.
7. REPORTING RESULTS:
◦ Review and verify all results for accuracy and
completeness.
◦ Reference Intervals:
▪ BASIL: Refer to manufacturer’s reference range or site-
specific guidelines.
▪ IGE: Refer to manufacturer’s reference range or site-
specific guidelines.
▪ SERUM: Refer to the established laboratory reference
intervals for each specific chemistry parameter.
◦ Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
for automatic transmission to the patient's electronic medical
record.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
◦ Refer to the reagent kit inserts for specific limitations
associated with each assay.
◦ Note any specimen conditions that may compromise test
results, such as hemolysis or improper storage.
9. TROUBLESHOOTING:
◦ If any control results fall outside the established range, do
not report patient results. Investigate and resolve the issue
before proceeding.
◦ Repeat testing if flagged errors occur or if inconsistent
results are obtained.
◦ Review instrument error codes and refer to the
manufacturer’s troubleshooting guide.
10. DOCUMENTATION:
◦ Record all actions, including calibrations, control results,
maintenance, and patient results, in the appropriate logs.
◦ Ensure all entries are clear and complete for traceability.
11. REFERENCES:
◦ Manufacturer’s product insert for BASIL reagent kit
◦ Manufacturer’s product insert for Total IgE reagent kit
◦ Manufacturer’s product insert for serum chemistry reagent
panel
Note: All laboratory personnel must follow standard laboratory safety
protocols, including the use of personal protective equipment, during
all phases of the testing process.
This SOP ensures consistency, accuracy, and reliability in the
analytical phase of generating results for BASIL, IGE, and SERUM
tests. Proper adherence to these procedures safeguards the quality
of laboratory results and maintains compliance with regulatory
standards.
