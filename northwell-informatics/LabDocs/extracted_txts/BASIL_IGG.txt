SOP: Analytical Phase of Generating Results for BASIL IgG
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedures required for the accurate and efficient
generation of BASIL IgG results, including specimen preparation,
equipment usage, quality control, and result reporting.
Responsibility: Laboratory staff trained in BASIL IgG testing are
responsible for adhering to this SOP and completing all necessary
steps to ensure the accuracy and reliability of results. Supervisors
are responsible for overseeing the process and addressing any
issues that may arise.
2. DEFINITION
BASIL IgG refers to the immunoassay for detecting IgG antibodies
against the BASIL antigen.
3. PROCEDURE
A) Specimen Preparation
1. Ensure that the specimen has been collected, received, and
accessioned according to established protocols.
2. Check that the specimen type is appropriate for BASIL IgG
testing:
◦ Preferred: Serum or plasma collected in SST (Serum
Separator Tube) or heparinized vacutainer (PST).
◦ Unacceptable: Hemolyzed specimens, samples that are too
old (>72 hours post-collection), or specimens lacking proper
labeling (including collection date/time).
3. Centrifuge the specimen at 1500-2000 g for 10 minutes to
separate the serum or plasma.
4. Aliquot the serum or plasma into appropriately labeled tubes,
ensuring no hemolysis is present.
B) Equipment and Reagents
1. BASIL IgG ELISA Kit (Brand/Manufacturer):
◦ Store reagents at 2-8°C.
◦ Do not use reagents past expiry date.
2. Microplate Reader:
◦ Ensure it is calibrated properly and that the calibration
certificate is up-to-date.
3. Pipettes, tips, and other general laboratory supplies must be
available and in good working order.
C) Testing Procedure
1. Preparation of Reagents:
◦ Bring all reagents to room temperature before use.
◦ Prepare wash buffer and other working solutions according
to the manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Loading Samples:
◦ Add 100 µL of each specimen, control, and standard to the
appropriate wells of the ELISA plate.
◦ Include negative and positive controls in each run.
3. Incubation:
◦ Incubate the plate for the specified time at room
temperature or at 37°C as per kit instructions.
◦ Remove any plate covers and wash the wells following the
recommended wash steps.
4. Addition of Conjugate:
◦ Add the conjugate reagent to the wells as outlined by the
manufacturer.
◦ Incubate for the specified time.
5. Detection:
◦ Follow the steps for adding substrate and stopping solutions
as provided in the kit insert.
◦ Measure the optical density (OD) at the appropriate
wavelength using the microplate reader.
D) Quality Control
1. Material:
◦ Include Kit controls (provided with the ELISA kit).
◦ Run internal quality controls (QCs) with each batch:
▪ Levels: Negative QC, Positive QC.
2. Procedure:
◦ Each new batch of reagents must be validated using the QC
materials.
◦ Record QC results and assess against established
acceptable ranges.
3. Troubleshooting:
◦ If QC fails, investigate potential causes (e.g. reagent issues,
pipetting errors, equipment malfunction).
◦ Repeat QC tests if necessary and consult with supervisors if
problems persist.
E) Reporting Results
1. Review and Verification:
◦ All results are automatically transmitted to the LIS
(Laboratory Information System) from the microplate reader.
◦ Technologist reviews and verifies results, ensuring all QC
criteria are met.
2. Critical Results:
◦ Results indicating significant deviations or clinical relevance
must be flagged and reported to the appropriate healthcare
provider.
3. Sample Integrity:
◦ Check for hemolysis or other integrity issues. If
compromised, notify the supervisor and document the
situation.
F) Reference Intervals
• Normal range for BASIL IgG: Refer to kit insert. Typically:
◦ Negative: < Cut-off value
◦ Positive: ≥ Cut-off value
G) Method Limitations
• Refer to kit insert for specific limitations regarding reagent and
assay performance.
H) References
• BASIL IgG ELISA Kit insert (Brand/Manufacturer)
• Laboratory specific guidelines
4. DOCUMENTATION
Maintain comprehensive records of each step, including specimen
receipt, preparation, testing, QC results, and reporting. Ensure
traceability and compliance.
