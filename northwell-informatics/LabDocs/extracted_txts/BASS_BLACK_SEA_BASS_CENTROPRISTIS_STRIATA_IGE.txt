Standard Operating Procedure
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized protocol for the assay of BASS BLACK
(SEA BASS) (CENTROPRISTIS STRIATA) IgE in human blood
serum samples. This assay is significant for diagnosing fish allergies,
specifically monitoring IgE levels against sea bass allergens.
2. SCOPE
This SOP is applicable to the analytical phase of operations within
the immunology section of the clinical laboratory. This protocol
assumes that the specimen has already been properly collected,
received, and accessioned according to the pre-analytical phase
SOPs.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
Laboratory technologists are responsible for conducting assays and
handling all aspects of testing according to the guidelines provided
herein. Supervisors will ensure all staff are adequately trained and
SOP adherence is maintained.
4. EQUIPMENT, MATERIALS, AND REAGENTS
Equipment:
• ELISA Plate Reader
• Microplate Washer
• Incubator
• Centrifuge
• Single and multichannel micropipettes
• Vortex mixer
Materials and Reagents:
• ELISA kit for BASS BLACK (SEA BASS) (CENTROPRISTIS
STRIATA) IgE
• Human serum samples
• Washing buffer (PBS/Tween)
• Substrate solution (TMB)
• Stop solution (1N H2SO4)
• Calibrators and controls
• Microtiter plates (96-well format)
5. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Ensure all reagents and samples are at room temperature
before use.
2. Assemble all required materials and check for expired reagents.
Do not use expired kits or reagents.
Assay Execution:
1. Preparation of Standards and Controls:
◦ Follow guidelines provided with the ELISA kit to prepare
standards and controls.
◦ Ensure appropriate dilutions and mixing.
2. Sample Preparation:
◦ Centrifuge collected serum samples at 3,000 rpm for 10
minutes to remove cells and debris.
◦ Transfer clear supernatant into clean tubes for analysis.
3. Plate Setup:
◦ Arrange standards, controls, and samples in duplicate on
the microtiter plate.
◦ Add 100 µL of standards, controls, and serum samples into
designated wells.
4. Incubation:
◦ Incubate the plate for 1 hour at room temperature or as
specified by the kit instructions.
◦ Cover the plate with a sealing film to prevent evaporation.
5. Washing:
◦ Wash the wells 5 times with 300 µL of washing buffer using
a microplate washer.
6. Addition of Detection Antibody:
◦ Add 100 µL of detection antibody to each well.
◦ Incubate the plate for an additional 30 minutes at room
temperature.
7. Washing:
◦ Repeat the washing step as above.
8. Substrate Reaction:
◦ Add 100 µL of TMB substrate solution to each well.
◦ Incubate the plate in the dark for 15 minutes at room
temperature.
9. Stopping the Reaction:
◦ Add 100 µL of stop solution to each well to halt the
enzymatic reaction.
10. Reading the Plate:
◦ Read the plate at 450 nm using an ELISA plate reader.
◦ Ensure blanks are subtracted and controls are within
acceptable ranges.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Use internal and external quality control materials.
• Perform quality control checks each time the assay is run and
document results.
• Calibrate the ELISA plate reader periodically and record
calibration data.
• If quality control results fall outside acceptable limits, identify and
document the source of error, repeat the control assays, and if
necessary, rerun the samples.
7. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
• Compare sample absorbance values against the standard curve
to determine the concentration of BASS BLACK (SEA BASS)
(CENTROPRISTIS STRIATA) IgE.
• Report any values that fall outside the linear range of the assay or
show significant deviations from the expected control values.
• Document and communicate any atypical results to the
supervising technologist.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS) for
review.
• Ensure all flagged results are highlighted and any critical values
are appropriately communicated as per lab policy.
• Review and verify results before final result release.
9. REFERENCES
• ELISA Kit Manufacturer's Instructions
• Relevant clinical and laboratory standards (CLSI Guidelines,
safety protocols, etc.)
10. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS
• Follow general laboratory safety protocols including the use of
personal protective equipment (PPE).
• Handle chemicals and biological specimens using appropriate
precautions to minimize risk of contamination or exposure.
• Dispose of biohazard and chemical waste in accordance with
laboratory safety policies and local regulations.
