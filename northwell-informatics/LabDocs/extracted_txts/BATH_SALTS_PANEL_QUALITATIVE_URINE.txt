Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Title: Analytical Procedure for
Bath Salts Panel (Qualitative) in Urine
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the procedures for the qualitative analysis of bath
salts in urine specimens using immunoassay techniques, followed by
confirmation with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry
(LC-MS/MS) or gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) as
needed.
Responsibility:
• Laboratory technologists are responsible for performing the urine
bath salts panel test and confirming positive results using
secondary analytical techniques.
• It is the responsibility of the technologist and supervisor to ensure
that all procedures are followed correctly and that quality control
measures are maintained.
1. DEFINITIONS
Bath salts: A group of synthetic drugs that mimic the effects of
amphetamines and/or cocaine, often including substances like
mephedrone, MDPV, and methylone.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type: Urine
Specimen Handling:
• Urine specimens should be collected in clean, dry containers.
• Store specimens at 2-8°C if analysis is delayed for up to 72 hours.
For longer storage, freeze at -20°C.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Immunoassay analyzer (e.g., Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent
Assay (ELISA))
• LC-MS/MS or GC-MS for confirmation testing
• Urinalysis cups
• Certified reference materials for bath salts
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Vortex mixer
• Centrifuge
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preliminary Screening Using Immunoassay
1. Perform visual inspection of the urine specimen for color,
turbidity, and volume. Record any unusual characteristics.
2. Prepare the immunoassay analyzer according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
3. Pipette the required volume of urine specimen into the sample
well of the assay kit or analyzer.
4. Run the assay according to the manufacturer's protocol.
5. Review the results:
◦ Negative: No detection of bath salts. No further testing is
required.
◦ Presumptive Positive: Presence of bath salts. Proceed with
confirmation testing.
B. Confirmation Testing Using LC-MS/MS or GC-MS
1. Prepare the instruments (LC-MS/MS or GC-MS) for use
according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
2. Prepare control and calibrators, and run validation samples to
ensure instrument performance.
3. Extract the urine sample using the appropriate sample
preparation method (e.g., solid phase extraction, liquid-liquid
extraction) tailored for bath salts analysis.
4. Inject the processed sample into the LC-MS/MS or GC-MS
system.
5. Acquire data and analyze the chromatograms using the
established method for qualitative analysis:
◦ Confirm the presence of bath salts by matching retention
times and mass spectra to known standards.
6. Report the result as confirmed positive if the analytes match,
otherwise negative.
C. Quality Control
1. Run positive and negative controls for both the immunoassay
and confirmation methods with each batch of samples.
2. Document all control results. Accept the run only if control
results fall within the specified limits.
3. Participate in proficiency testing programs and internal quality
assessments regularly.
4. REPORTING RESULTS
5. Report preliminary screening results directly into the Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
◦ Negative: Indicate no detection of bath salts.
◦ Presumptive Positive: Indicate that confirmation testing is
needed.
6. For confirmed positive results, update the LIS with the specifics
of the detected analytes and note that the results have been
confirmed by LC-MS/MS or GC-MS.
7. Notify the ordering physician or healthcare provider if the
results fall within critical reporting parameters as defined by the
lab’s policies.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
9. Cross-reactivity: Be aware of potential cross-reactivity with
other substances that may produce false positives or negatives.
10. Detection Limits: Ensure that the detection limits of the
instruments meet the required sensitivity for bath salts.
11. REFERENCES
Follow all manufacturer's instructions for both immunoassay kits and
LC-MS/MS or GC-MS systems. Standard reference materials from
regulatory bodies (e.g., NIST or equivalent).
1. REVIEW AND REVISION HISTORY
All SOPs will be reviewed annually and updated as necessary to
ensure compliance with current best practices and regulatory
standards.
