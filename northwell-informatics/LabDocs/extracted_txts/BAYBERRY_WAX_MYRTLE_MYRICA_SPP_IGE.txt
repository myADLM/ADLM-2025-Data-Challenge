Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for BAYBERRY/WAX MYRTLE (MYRICA SPP)
IGE
1. PURPOSE
To establish a standardized procedure for the analytical phase in the
generation of IgE results specific to Bayberry/Wax Myrtle (Myrica
spp.) allergens. This procedure ensures accurate and reliable results
for the diagnosis and assessment of allergic reactions to Bayberry/
Wax Myrtle.
RESPONSIBILITY:
All designated laboratory staff are responsible for following the
procedures outlined in this SOP to ensure the accurate and timely
processing of samples.
1. DEFINITION
Bayberry/Wax Myrtle (Myrica spp.) IgE: Immunoglobulin E (IgE)
specific to antigens from Bayberry/Wax Myrtle plant species, used for
diagnosing and monitoring allergic responses.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Pre-Analytical Steps:
1. Verify the specimen type: Serum or plasma collected using
standard phlebotomy techniques and transported to the
laboratory.
2. Check specimen integrity: Ensure no hemolysis, lipemia, or
contamination.
3. Confirm the identification information matches the requisition
forms.
B. Analytical Steps:
1. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies:
◦ Automated Immunoassay Analyzer (e.g., ImmunoCAP,
Pharmacia)
◦ Bayberry/Wax Myrtle (Myrica spp.) allergen reagents
◦ Calibrators, controls, and consumables specific to IgE
assays
◦ Sample tubes, pipettes, and other standard laboratory
supplies
2. Instrument Calibration:
◦ Follow manufacturer instructions to calibrate the analyzer
daily.
◦ Ensure the use of allergen-specific calibrators for Bayberry/
Wax Myrtle (Myrica spp.).
3. Sample Preparation:
◦ Serum or plasma samples should be centrifuged if
necessary (refer to analyzer specifications).
◦ Aliquot prepared samples into appropriately labeled tubes
for analysis.
4. Assay Procedure:
◦ Load the samples, controls, and reagents onto the
immunoassay analyzer.
◦ Select the Bayberry/Wax Myrtle (Myrica spp.) IgE test from
the analyzer's menu.
◦ Initiate the assay run according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
C. Post-Analytical Steps:
1. Reviewing Results:
◦ Ensure software-generated results meet quality control
standards.
◦ Cross-check results with controls and calibrators to confirm
validity.
◦ Any discrepancies or out-of-control results should be
documented and investigated.
2. Reporting Results:
◦ Results should be recorded in the laboratory information
system (LIS).
◦ Ensure reference intervals and clinical significance are
included in the report.
◦ Critical results should be flagged and communicated to the
ordering clinician per site-specific guidelines.
3. QUALITY CONTROL
4. Internal Quality Control:
◦ Run quality control samples (e.g., low, medium, high IgE
concentrations) during each assay to validate performance.
◦ Document and review QC results, ensuring they are within
acceptable limits.
5. External Quality Assurance:
◦ Participate in proficiency testing programs for allergen-
specific IgE measurements.
◦ Perform periodic assessments to maintain high standards of
analytical accuracy.
6. SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS
All staff must adhere to standard laboratory safety protocols including
wearing appropriate PPE, handling biological samples following
biosafety guidelines, and proper disposal of biohazard materials.
