Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for BAY LEAF, IGE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedures for the analytical phase of generating
results for BAY LEAF, IGE, SERUM analysis. This includes the
validation, calibration, quality control, and reporting of results to
ensure consistency and accuracy in test results.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory personnel to
perform all procedures as outlined in this SOP. All staff should be
vigilant and report any inconsistencies or issues to the supervisor
immediately.
1. DEFINITIONS
BAY LEAF, IGE, SERUM:
• An in-vitro diagnostic test for the quantitative determination of
Immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies specific to Bay Leaf in serum.
1. PROCEDURE
A) Sample Preparation:
1. Ensure the serum sample has been collected, received, and
accessioned.
2. Verify the specimen integrity (e.g., no hemolysis, proper
volume) and confirm it is labeled correctly with patient
information.
B) Reagents, Equipment, and Supplies:
1. Bay Leaf specific IgE reagent kit.
2. CAL/STD and QC material as per manufacturer specifications.
3. Automated immunoassay analyzer capable of processing
specific IgE tests.
4. Micropipettes and tips, as required.
5. Calibrated and maintained refrigerated centrifuge.
6. Temperature and humidity-controlled storage for reagents.
C) Calibration and Quality Control:
1. Calibration: a. Perform calibration of the analyzer using the
calibration standards provided in the IgE reagent kit prior to
testing. Follow the manufacturer’s instruction for the calibration
procedure. b. Record the calibration details including date, lot
number of standards, and results in the Calibration Log. c. If
calibration fails, troubleshoot, recalibrate, or contact technical
support as necessary.
2. Quality Control: a. Perform quality control testing with each run
using two levels of QC material. b. Run QC samples at both low
and high levels to ensure accuracy across the measuring
range. Follow the kit manufacturer's instructions. c. Document
QC results in the Quality Control Log. Quality control results
must fall within the manufacturer's acceptable range. If QC
results are outside of the acceptable range, investigate, and
take corrective actions. Re-run samples if necessary.
D) Testing Procedure:
1. Using the automated analyzer, enter the test request
(specifying BAY LEAF, IGE, SERUM).
2. Load the patient serum samples, calibration standards, and
quality controls into the analyzer.
3. Ensure that all reagents and consumables are adequately
loaded, and that the instrument parameters are set.
4. Follow the instrument prompts to start the assay. The analyzer
will automatically process the samples and generate results.
E) Reporting Results:
1. Review the results generated by the analyzer for the BAY LEAF,
IGE, SERUM.
2. Ensure that results for QC samples are within the acceptable
range. If not, re-run the assay.
3. Validate the patient results, making sure there are no flags or
errors indicated by the analyzer.
4. Enter the validated IgE results into the Laboratory Information
System (LIS) and ensure results are reported in compliance
with site-specific reporting guidelines.
5. Any results outside of normal reference intervals or deemed
critical must be reported to the requesting physician
immediately.
F) Documentation:
1. Maintain logs for calibration, quality control, and all test results.
2. Ensure all corrective actions taken are documented in case of
an out-of-range result.
3. Record any issues with the testing process or equipment in the
maintenance log and inform the supervisor.
4. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Immunoglobulin E (IgE), SERUM Reference Intervals:
• Specific reference intervals for BAY LEAF, IGE will be provided by
the reagent manufacturer. Refer to the specific kit insert for these
intervals.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the product insert for BAY LEAF, IGE reagent kit for any
limitations in the assay. Ensure awareness of factors that might
interfere with test results such as sample hemolysis, lipemia,
anticoagulant interference, etc.
1. REFERENCES
Include the references to the reagent kit insert, any additional training
materials, and manufacturer's user guide for the analyzer used in the
procedure.
By following this SOP, the laboratory ensures the generation of
consistent, accurate, and reliable results for BAY LEAF, IGE, SERUM
analysis.
