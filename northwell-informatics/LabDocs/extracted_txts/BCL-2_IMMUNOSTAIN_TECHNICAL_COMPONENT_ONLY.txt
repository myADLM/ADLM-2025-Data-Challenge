SOP: BCL-2 Immunostain, Technical Component Only
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for performing technical component of
BCL-2 immunostaining. This includes the staining of slides with
BCL-2 antibody and processing them for examination by a
pathologist. BCL-2 is a key marker used in the diagnosis of certain
lymphomas and other malignancies.
RESPONSIBILITY:
It is the responsibility of the laboratory technologist to ensure that the
BCL-2 immunostain is performed accurately and efficiently, according
to this protocol. The technologist should follow the outlined
procedures and handle the specimens and reagents with care to
ensure the validity, reliability, and reproducibility of results.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS:
Acceptable Specimen Types:
• Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks.
• Unstained slides prepared from FFPE blocks.
Unacceptable Specimen Types:
• Specimens that are not adequately fixed.
• Specimens showing signs of severe autolysis.
3. REAGENTS AND MATERIALS:
• Anti-BCL-2 antibody
• Positive Control slides
• Negative Control slides
• PBS Buffer (Phosphate-Buffered Saline)
• Secondary Antibody (if required by antibody protocol)
• DAB Chromogen Substrate Kit
• Hematoxylin
• Mounting Medium
• Glass microscope slides
• Coverslips
• Microtome (for sectioning FFPE blocks)
• Automated Immunostainer (if available) or manual staining
equipment
4. EQUIPMENT:
• Microtome
• Slide heating and deparaffinization equipment
• Automated or manual immunostainer
• Microscope
5. PROCEDURE:
A. Slide Preparation:
1. Section Cutting:
◦ Using a microtome, cut 3-4 µm thin sections from the FFPE
tissue block and place sections on adhesive glass slides.
Ensure the sections are flat and without folds.
2. Deparaffinization:
◦ Heat slides at 60°C for approximately 30 minutes.
◦ Deparaffinize slides in xylene for 2 x 10 minutes.
◦ Rehydrate through a series of graded alcohols:
▪ 100% ethanol, 2 x 5 minutes
▪ 95% ethanol, 1 x 5 minutes
▪ 70% ethanol, 1 x 5 minutes
▪ Rinse in distilled water.
B. Antigen Retrieval: - Perform antigen retrieval based on the
antibody datasheet recommendations (e.g., heat-induced using a
buffer like citrate buffer pH 6.0 or EDTA buffer pH 8.0). - Heat the
slides in a microwave or pressure cooker at the appropriate
temperature and time. - Allow slides to cool down to room
temperature before proceeding.
C. Staining:
1. Blocking:
◦ Immerse slides in a protein-blocking solution for 20 minutes
to prevent non-specific binding.
2. Primary Antibody Incubation:
◦ Incubate slides with BCL-2 primary antibody at the dilution
and for the duration specified in the antibody datasheet.
◦ Wash slides in PBS buffer for 3 x 5 minutes.
3. Secondary Antibody Incubation:
◦ Apply a biotinylated secondary antibody (if required) and
incubate according to the antibody instructions.
◦ Wash slides in PBS buffer for 3 x 5 minutes.
4. Chromogen Development:
◦ Apply DAB chromogen substrate solution to the slides and
monitor under microscope ensuring optimal stain
development time (typically 3-10 minutes).
◦ Rinse slides in distilled water to stop the reaction.
D. Counterstaining:
• Immerse slides in hematoxylin for 1-3 minutes.
• Rinse slides in increasing grades of alcohol and finally in xylene
to clear.
E. Mounting:
• Apply mounting medium to the slides and place coverslips over
them.
6. QUALITY CONTROL:
• Include positive and negative control slides with each staining run.
• Inspect control slides under a microscope before releasing patient
slides.
• If controls do not stain as expected, the staining run must be
repeated.
7. DOCUMENTATION:
• Record the staining batch number, antibody details, date, and
initials of the technologist performing the procedure in the
logbook.
• Record the control results in the Quality Control logsheet.
8. TROUBLESHOOTING:
• If the sample is inadequately stained, such as weak or non-
specific staining, verify antibody concentration, incubation times,
and reagent expiration dates.
• Consult with senior technologist or pathologist if repeated issues
occur.
9. REPORTING RESULTS:
• The stained slides are delivered to the pathologist for
interpretation.
• Pathologist verifies the technical adequacy of the slides and
reports diagnostic findings as necessary.
10. STORAGE AND DISPOSAL:
• Store the stained slides in appropriate slide storage cabinets.
• Dispose of waste reagents following laboratory biosafety and
chemical hygiene guidelines.
11. REFERENCES:
• BCL-2 antibody specification datasheet and protocol insert.
• Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines on
immunohistochemistry methodology.
This protocol ensures consistency and accuracy in performing BCL-2
immunostains, upholding diagnostic reliability and achieving high
standards of laboratory practice.
