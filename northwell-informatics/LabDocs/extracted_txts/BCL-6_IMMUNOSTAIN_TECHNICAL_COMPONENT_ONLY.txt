Standard Operating Procedure
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this SOP is to detail the analytical
procedures to be followed in the technical component only of
generating results for BCL-6 immunostain in tissue specimen
analysis. This protocol does not cover the interpretive component,
which should be conducted by a qualified pathologist.
2. RESPONSIBILITY Designated laboratory personnel, typically a
trained histotechnologist, shall perform the technical tasks as outlined
in this procedure. It is the responsibility of all personnel involved to
ensure adherence to this SOP to maintain the accuracy and reliability
of test results.
3. DEFINITION BCL-6 is a protein typically used as a marker in
identifying certain types of B-cell lymphomas. Immunostaining refers
to the process of using antibodies to detect the presence and
abundance of this protein in tissue sections.
4. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
• Microtome
• Water bath
• Incubator
• Optimized BCL-6 primary antibody
• Secondary antibody appropriate for BCL-6 primary antibody
• Detection system (e.g., DAB chromogen kit)
• Positive control tissue (e.g., tissue known to express BCL-6)
• Negative control tissue (e.g., tissue known not to express BCL-6)
• Xylene
• Ethanol (absolute and 95%)
• Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)
• Mounting medium
• Coverslips
• Hematoxylin counterstain
• Pathology microscope
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue sections.
• Thickness of sections: 3-4 micrometers.
6. PROCEDURE
Preparation of Tissue Sections:
1. Section the FFPE tissue block at 3-4 micrometers using a
microtome.
2. Float tissue sections on a water bath set at appropriate
temperature (generally around 40°C) and then mount them on
positively charged glass slides.
3. Bake slides in an incubator at 60°C for at least 1 hour or
overnight to ensure tissue adherence.
Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
1. Deparaffinize slides by placing them in three changes of xylene,
5 minutes each.
2. Rehydrate the tissue through a series of ethanol washes: two
changes of 100% ethanol for 5 minutes each, followed by two
changes of 95% ethanol for 5 minutes each.
3. Rinse slides in distilled water for 5 minutes.
Antigen Retrieval:
1. Perform antigen retrieval using an appropriate method such as
heat-induced epitope retrieval (HIER). If using a pressure
cooker, place slides in a citrate buffer (pH 6.0) and pressurize at
120°C for 15-20 minutes.
2. Allow slides to cool in the buffer solution for at least 20 minutes
before proceeding.
3. Rinse slides in PBS for 5 minutes, 2 times.
Blocking and Primary Antibody Incubation:
1. Block endogenous peroxidase activity by incubating slides with
3% H2O2 for 10 minutes.
2. Rinse slides in PBS.
3. Apply a protein block (such as serum or bovine serum albumin)
for 10 minutes to prevent non-specific binding.
4. Incubate slides with the BCL-6 primary antibody at the
optimized dilution and incubation time (commonly 1:50-1:200
dilution, 30 minutes to 1 hour at room temperature, or overnight
at 4°C depending on antibody).
Secondary Antibody and Detection:
1. Rinse slides in PBS for 5 minutes, 2 times.
2. Apply the appropriate secondary antibody, which is species-
specific (e.g., anti-mouse or anti-rabbit), and incubate as per
manufacturer’s instruction (usually 30 minutes).
3. Rinse slides in PBS for 5 minutes, 2 times.
4. Apply the detection system such as DAB chromogen to
visualize the antibody-antigen binding.
5. Incubate for the time specified by the manufacturer (typically
around 5 minutes).
6. Rinse slides in distilled water.
Counterstaining and Mounting:
1. Counterstain with hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes to visualize cell
nuclei.
2. Rinse with tap water to blue the hematoxylin.
3. Dehydrate through graded ethanol solutions (95% ethanol
followed by 100% ethanol) and clear in xylene.
4. Mount the coverslip using mounting medium.
Quality Control:
1. Run positive control (known BCL-6 positive tissue) and
negative control (known BCL-6 negative tissue) with each
batch.
2. Record the staining intensity and quality in a logbook for each
batch.
7. REPORTING RESULTS:
1. The technical component only includes preparing the stained
slides.
2. Documentation of reagent lot numbers, expiration dates, and
conditions of controls should be maintained.
3. The interpretive component is to be conducted by a pathologist
who will review and report the results.
8. TROUBLESHOOTING:
• If control slides do not stain correctly, review all steps to identify
potential errors such as antibody degradation, incorrect incubation
times, or buffer pH issues.
• Adjust as necessary and re-run controls and patient samples.
9. REFERENCES:
• Vendor guidelines for BCL-6 antibody.
• Established laboratory protocols for Immunohistochemistry (IHC)
procedures.
10. REVIEW: This SOP is subject to annual review and updates as
needed per changes in methodology or instrument/reagent updates.
By following this SOP, the laboratory ensures consistent and accurate
technical processing of BCL-6 immunostains.
