Standard Operating Procedure
(SOP) for BCOR Immunostain,
Technical Component Only
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the technical component of
BCOR immunostain in order to ensure accurate and consistent
results for diagnostic interpretation.
2. SCOPE
This protocol applies to all technical staff involved in the preparation,
staining, and initial quality control of BCOR immunostain within the
laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Histotechnologists: Responsible for sectioning, staining, and
performing initial quality control checks of the BCOR
immunostain.
• Laboratory Supervisors: Responsible for overseeing the
procedure, verifying that all steps are followed correctly, and
addressing any discrepancies or issues that arise.
• Quality Control Personnel: Responsible for documenting and
reviewing QC data and ensuring compliance with laboratory
standards.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Tissue Type: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue
sections.
• Section Size: Cut sections at 4 micrometers thickness.
• Slide Preparation: Slides must be positively charged and labeled
with the case number and block identifier.
5. REAGENTS AND EQUIPMENT
Reagents:
• Primary Antibody: BCOR antibody (specific clone according to
laboratory supply).
• Secondary Antibody: Biotin-conjugated secondary antibody.
• Chromogen: DAB (Diaminobenzidine) substrate.
• Counterstain: Hematoxylin.
Equipment:
• Microtome: For cutting tissue sections.
• Water Bath: For floating and mounting tissue sections.
• Incubator or Slide Warmer: Set to 60°C for baking slides.
• Staining Rack: For slide processing.
• Automated Stainer (if applicable): For automated staining
processes.
• Microscope: For initial quality control checks.
6. PROCEDURE
A. Slide Preparation
1. Sectioning:
◦ Cut 4 micrometer sections from FFPE tissue blocks using a
microtome.
◦ Float sections on a water bath heated to approximately
40-45°C.
◦ Mount sections onto positively charged slides.
◦ Bake slides in an incubator or slide warmer at 60°C for
45-60 minutes to improve adhesion.
B. Deparaffinization and Rehydration
1. Deparaffinization:
◦ Place slides in xylene (2 changes) for 5 minutes each.
◦ Rehydrate slides through a series of graded ethanol
solutions:
▪ 100% ethanol (2 changes) for 3 minutes each.
▪ 95% ethanol for 1 minute.
▪ 70% ethanol for 1 minute.
▪ Distilled water for 1 minute.
C. Antigen Retrieval
1. Antigen Retrieval:
◦ Place slides in pre-heated antigen retrieval solution (e.g.,
citrate buffer, pH 6.0) and heat at 95-100°C for 20 minutes.
◦ Allow slides to cool in the buffer for 20 minutes at room
temperature.
◦ Rinse slides in distilled water followed by phosphate-
buffered saline (PBS).
D. Immunostaining
1. Blocking:
◦ Apply enzyme block if necessary.
◦ Incubate slides with a protein block (e.g., 5% normal serum)
for 10 minutes to reduce non-specific binding.
2. Primary Antibody Incubation:
◦ Apply BCOR primary antibody to each section.
◦ Incubate in a humidified chamber at room temperature for
30-60 minutes or as per antibody manufacturer's
recommendation.
3. Secondary Antibody Incubation:
◦ Rinse slides in PBS.
◦ Apply biotin-conjugated secondary antibody.
◦ Incubate in a humidified chamber for 20-30 minutes.
4. Detection and Chromogen Development:
◦ Apply streptavidin-HRP (horseradish peroxidase) solution to
slides.
◦ Incubate for 20-30 minutes.
◦ Rinse slides in PBS.
◦ Apply DAB substrate, monitoring the development of the
brown color for 1-2 minutes.
E. Counterstaining and Mounting
1. Counterstaining:
◦ Rinse slides in distilled water.
◦ Counterstain slides in hematoxylin for 1 minute.
◦ Rinse slides in tap water and proceed with bluing in
ammonia or Scotts tap water substitute.
2. Dehydration:
◦ Dehydrate through graded ethanol solutions:
▪ 70% ethanol for 1 minute.
▪ 95% ethanol for 1 minute.
▪ 100% ethanol (2 changes) for 3 minutes each.
◦ Clear slides in xylene (2 changes) for 3 minutes each.
3. Mounting:
◦ Apply coverslip using a permanent mounting medium.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Initial QC Check:
◦ Examine stained slides under a microscope to verify staining
quality.
◦ Ensure that positive control tissues display expected staining
patterns.
◦ Negative control slides should show no staining in the
absence of primary antibody.
• Documentation:
◦ Record all QC findings in the QC log.
◦ Report any discrepancies or issues to the laboratory
supervisor for further investigation and corrective actions.

9. RECORDING AND REPORTING
RESULTS
• Results are not provided as this protocol covers the technical
component only. Ensure all technical data, observations, and QC
results are documented and passed on to the relevant pathologist
or pathologist assistant for diagnostic interpretation.
By adhering to this SOP, laboratory staff can ensure the proper
handling and staining of tissue sections for BCOR immunostain,
leading to reliable and consistent results for diagnostic purposes.
