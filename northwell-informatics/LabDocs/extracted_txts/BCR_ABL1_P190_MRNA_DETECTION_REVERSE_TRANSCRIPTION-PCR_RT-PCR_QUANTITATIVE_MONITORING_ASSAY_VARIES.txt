Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for BCR/ABL1, p190, mRNA Detection by
Reverse Transcription PCR (RT-PCR), Quantitative, Monitoring
Assay
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedures for the analytical
phase of BCR/ABL1, p190, mRNA Detection using Reverse
Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) for quantitative
monitoring.
1. SCOPE
This SOP is applicable to all laboratory staff trained and approved to
perform mRNA quantification for the BCR/ABL1 p190 fusion
transcript using RT-PCR technology.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of qualified laboratory personnel to ensure that
this assay is performed according to the procedures outlined in this
SOP.
1. DEFINITIONS
BCR/ABL1, p190: The oncogenic fusion transcript of genes BCR
(Breakpoint Cluster Region) and ABL1 (Abelson 1 kinase),
associated specifically with chronic myelogenous leukemia and some
acute lymphoblastic leukemias.
RT-PCR: A molecular technique used to amplify and quantify RNA
sequences by converting them into complementary DNA (cDNA).
1. EQUIPMENT & REAGENTS
• RT-PCR thermal cycler
• Microcentrifuge
• Pipettes and tips (sterile, RNase-free)
• Microcentrifuge tubes (sterile, RNase-free)
• RNA extraction kit
• Reverse Transcription Master Mix
• PCR Master Mix with specific BCR/ABL1, p190 primers and
probes
• RNase-free water
• Positive and negative control RNA samples
• Calibrated computer with RT-PCR software for quantitative
analysis
1. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Ensure all equipment, reagents, and work surfaces are
decontaminated and RNase-free.
2. Calibrate and verify RT-PCR thermocycler performance as per
manufacturer’s instructions.
RNA Extraction:
1. Extract total RNA from the patient’s specimen using a
commercial RNA extraction kit.
2. Elute RNA in RNase-free water.
3. Measure RNA concentration and purity using a
spectrophotometer.
4. Store RNA at -80°C if not immediately used.
cDNA Synthesis:
1. Prepare the Reverse Transcription Master Mix according to the
kit instructions.
2. Add the required amount of RNA to the Reverse Transcription
Master Mix.
3. Incubate the reaction mix in a thermal cycler with the following
conditions:
◦ 25°C for 10 minutes
◦ 50°C for 30 minutes
◦ 85°C for 5 minutes
4. Store the synthesized cDNA at -20°C until used for PCR.
RT-PCR Setup:
1. Prepare the PCR Master Mix, including specific primers and
probes for BCR/ABL1, p190.
2. Aliquot the master mix into PCR reaction tubes or plates.
3. Add cDNA template, positive control, and negative control to
the designated tubes/wells.
4. Seal the tubes or plates properly for the RT-PCR thermal cycler.
RT-PCR Cycling Conditions:
1. Load the reaction tubes/plates into the RT-PCR cycler.
2. Set the following cycling conditions:
◦ Initial activation: 95°C for 15 minutes
◦ 40 cycles of:
▪ Denaturation: 95°C for 15 seconds
▪ Annealing/Extension: 60°C for 1 minute
3. Ensure that RT-PCR software is set for fluorescence data
collection during each cycle.
Result Analysis:
1. Upon completion of the RT-PCR run, retrieve the data from the
thermal cycler.
2. Analyze the data using the RT-PCR software to quantify the
BCR/ABL1, p190 transcript levels.
3. Normalize the data using an endogenous control (e.g., ABL1) to
account for variability in RNA input.
4. Interpret results based on the threshold crossing point (Ct)
values.
Quality Control:
• Ensure that positive and negative controls show expected results.
• Action should be taken if controls do not give the expected
outcomes (e.g., repeat the assay).
Reporting Results:
1. Document the Ct values and normalized data in the laboratory
information system.
2. Results should be reviewed and verified by a qualified
technologist.
