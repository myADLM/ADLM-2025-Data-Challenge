Title: Analytical Phase of Generating Results for BCR/ABL1, P190,
mRNA Detection, Reverse Transcription-PCR (RT-PCR),
Quantitative, Reflex, Varies
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for the detection and quantification of BCR/
ABL1, P190 mRNA using Reverse Transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) to
ensure accurate and reproducible results.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of trained laboratory personnel to perform the
BCR/ABL1, P190 mRNA detection and quantification using RT-PCR
accurately, and according to the established protocol. Supervisors
must ensure compliance with all procedural requirements and
troubleshoot any issues that arise.
2. DEFINITIONS
RT-PCR: Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction
Quantitative PCR: A technique used to measure the quantity of a
specific part of DNA or RNA BCR/ABL1, P190: A fusion gene formed
from parts of the BCR and ABL1 genes, associated with certain
leukemias.
3. PROCEDURE
Specimen Requirements:
• Whole blood or bone marrow aspirates collected in EDTA tubes.
• Specimens should be fresh or stored at 2-8°C and processed
within 48 hours of collection.
• Specimens must be labeled clearly with patient identifiers and
collection details.
Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies:
• RT-PCR machine
• RNA extraction kit
• Reverse transcription reagents
• PCR reagents and primers specific for BCR/ABL1, P190
• Thermocycler
• Quantitative PCR reagents
• Reference controls
Specimen Preparation:
1. RNA Extraction:
◦ Extract RNA from the specimen using an RNA extraction kit
following the manufacturer's instructions.
◦ Measure RNA concentration and check purity using
spectrophotometry.
2. Reverse Transcription:
◦ Use reverse transcription reagents to synthesize
complementary DNA (cDNA) from the extracted RNA.
◦ Follow manufacturer’s instructions for reaction setup and
conditions.
RT-PCR Setup:
1. Prepare PCR mixture containing:
◦ cDNA template
◦ PCR primers specific for BCR/ABL1, P190
◦ PCR master mix
◦ Reference controls
2. Program the thermocycler with the specific cycling conditions
for BCR/ABL1, P190:
◦ Initial denaturation: [specific temperature and time]
◦ Amplification cycles: [specific temperatures and times for
denaturation, annealing, and extension]
◦ Final extension: [specific temperature and time]
Quantitative Analysis:
1. Quantitative PCR Setup:
◦ Prepare the reaction mixture for quantitative PCR with
reagents specific for BCR/ABL1, P190.
◦ Include reference controls in the setup.
2. Amplification and Detection:
◦ Run the quantitative PCR.
◦ Use the RT-PCR machine’s software to collect and analyze
data.
3. Calculation:
◦ Determine the quantity of BCR/ABL1, P190 mRNA in the
sample by comparing it with reference controls.
◦ Compute relative quantification using appropriate software
tools.
Quality Control:
1. Include positive and negative controls in each batch of tests to
ensure the validity of the results.
2. Regularly calibrate and maintain the RT-PCR machine and
thermocycler according to manufacturer instructions.
3. Ensure standardization in the preparation and handling of
specimens and reagents.
Reporting Results:
1. Results should be reviewed and verified by technologist.
2. Report quantitative results with proper annotations and
reference ranges.
3. If BCR/ABL1, P190 mRNA is detected, reflex testing for
additional markers or retesting might be required based on
clinical guidelines.
