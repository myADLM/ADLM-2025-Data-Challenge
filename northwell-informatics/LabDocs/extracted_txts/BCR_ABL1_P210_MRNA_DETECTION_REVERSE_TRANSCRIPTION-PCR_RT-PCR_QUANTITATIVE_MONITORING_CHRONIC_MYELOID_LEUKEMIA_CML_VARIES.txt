Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: BCR/ABL1, P210, mRNA Detection by Reverse Transcription-
PCR (RT-PCR) - Quantitative, Monitoring Chronic Myeloid Leukemia
(CML)
1. PURPOSE
To establish a standardized procedure for the quantitative detection
of BCR/ABL1, P210 mRNA using reverse transcription-PCR (RT-
PCR) for monitoring Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) patients. This
protocol ensures accuracy, precision, and reproducibility in
generating results.
2. SCOPE
This protocol applies to all laboratory personnel involved in the
processing and analysis of samples for BCR/ABL1, P210 mRNA
detection using RT-PCR within the laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
All laboratory technologists performing the assay must be trained and
demonstrate competence in RT-PCR techniques. It is the
responsibility of the laboratory supervisor to ensure that all staff
adhere to this SOP and maintain compliance with regulatory and
quality standards.
4. DEFINITIONS
BCR/ABL1, P210: A fusion gene created by the Philadelphia
chromosome translocation, characteristic of CML. RT-PCR: Reverse
Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction, a technique used to
quantify mRNA levels.
5. REAGENTS, MATERIALS, AND EQUIPMENT
• Extraction kit (e.g., Qiagen RNeasy Kit)
• Reverse transcription reagents (e.g., High-Capacity cDNA
Reverse Transcription Kit)
• PCR reagents (e.g., TaqMan Universal Master Mix)
• Primers and probes specific for BCR/ABL1, P210, and control
gene (e.g., ABL1)
• Real-time PCR instrument (e.g., Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast
Real-Time PCR System)
• Microcentrifuge tubes
• Pipettes and filtered tips
• Sterile, nuclease-free water
6. PROCEDURE
6.1 Sample Preparation
1. Ensure the sample is properly accessioned and labeled.
2. Extract RNA from peripheral blood or bone marrow samples
using an appropriate RNA extraction kit according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
3. Determine RNA concentration and purity using a
spectrophotometer (e.g., NanoDrop).
6.2 Reverse Transcription
1. Prepare the reverse transcription reaction mix as per the
reverse transcription kit instructions.
2. Add the required amount of RNA template to the reaction mix.
3. Perform the reverse transcription reaction in a thermal cycler as
per the kit guidelines.
6.3 PCR Amplification
1. Prepare the PCR master mix according to the instructions
provided with the TaqMan Universal Master Mix. Include
primers and probes specific for BCR/ABL1, P210, and internal
control gene ABL1.
2. Aliquot the master mix into PCR tubes or a 96-well plate.
3. Add cDNA template generated from the reverse transcription
step to each well.
4. Load the plate into the RT-PCR instrument and set up the PCR
program with the appropriate cycling conditions:
◦ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 10 minutes
◦ Amplification cycles (40 cycles): 95°C for 15 seconds
(denaturation), 60°C for 1 minute (annealing/extension)
6.4 Data Analysis
1. Analyze the RT-PCR data using the instrument's software.
2. Quantify the BCR/ABL1 mRNA transcript levels relative to the
internal control gene ABL1 using the ΔΔCt method.
3. Convert the Ct values into absolute copy numbers if standard
curves are available.
6.5 Quality Control
1. Include positive and negative controls in each run to verify the
assay performance.
2. Ensure that the negative control shows no amplification and the
positive control exhibits the expected Ct values.
3. If controls fail, troubleshoot the assay, repeat the analysis, and
document any corrective actions taken.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Review the data to ensure accuracy and consistency.
2. Document the results in the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
3. Report results as BCR/ABL1 mRNA transcript levels (e.g.,
BCR/ABL1/ABL1 ratio) with appropriate interpretation notes for
clinical relevance.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• RNA quality and quantity are critical for accurate results.
Degraded or insufficient RNA may lead to invalid results.
• Cross-contamination during sample processing can lead to false-
positive results. Use aseptic techniques and handle samples
individually.
• Ensure proper calibration and maintenance of the RT-PCR
instrument to avoid technical errors.
