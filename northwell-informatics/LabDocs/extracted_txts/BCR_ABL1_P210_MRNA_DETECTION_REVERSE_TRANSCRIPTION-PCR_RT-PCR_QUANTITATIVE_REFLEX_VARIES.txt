Protocol for the Analytical Phase of Generating Results for BCR/
ABL1, P210, mRNA Detection using Reverse Transcription-PCR
(RT-PCR), Quantitative, Reflex, Varies
1. PURPOSE
To establish a standardized procedure for the detection and
quantification of BCR/ABL1, P210 mRNA using Reverse
Transcription-PCR (RT-PCR), ensuring accurate and reproducible
results for clinical diagnosis and monitoring.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
• It is the responsibility of designated laboratory staff to perform and
document all steps of the RT-PCR procedure.
• It is the responsibility of the laboratory supervisor to ensure the
procedure is followed correctly and to handle any deviations or
issues encountered during testing.
3. DEFINITIONS
• RT-PCR (Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction): A
laboratory technique combining reverse transcription of RNA into
DNA and amplification of specific DNA targets using PCR.
• BCR/ABL1, P210 mRNA: A fusion gene formed from parts of the
BCR ("breakpoint cluster region") gene and ABL1 ("Abelson
murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog 1") gene, commonly
associated with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML).
• Quantitative PCR: A PCR method that quantifies the amount of a
specific part of DNA (in this case, BCR/ABL1 mRNA), allowing for
the assessment of gene expression levels.
• Reflex Testing: Additional testing performed based on initial test
results to provide further diagnostic information.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Peripheral blood or bone marrow.
• Volume: 5-10 mL of blood in EDTA (lavender top) tube or 1-2 mL
of bone marrow in EDTA tube.
• Handling: Specimens should be transported at room temperature
and received in the laboratory within 24 hours of collection. If
there is a delay, store specimens at 2-8°C and process within 72
hours.

• One-Step RT-PCR Kit
• BCR/ABL1, P210 mRNA Specific Primers and Probes
• Nuclease-Free Water
• Positive and Negative Controls

6. PROCEDURE
6.1 RNA Extraction
1. Sample Preparation:
◦ Mix the blood or bone marrow specimen by gentle inversion.
◦ Aliquot 1-2 mL of the specimen into a sterile RNA extraction
tube.
2. RNA Isolation:
◦ Follow the manufacturer's instructions for the RNA
Extraction Kit.
◦ Elute RNA in 50 µL of nuclease-free water.
◦ Quantify RNA concentration using a spectrophotometer or a
fluorometer.
◦ Store RNA samples at -80°C if not used immediately.
6.2 Reverse Transcription and PCR Setup
1. Prepare RT-PCR Master Mix:
◦ Thaw RNA samples and reagents on ice.
◦ Prepare the master mix according to the One-Step RT-PCR
Kit instructions:
▪ Include primers and probes specific for BCR/ABL1, P210
mRNA.
▪ Add nuclease-free water to achieve the desired final
volume.
2. RT-PCR Reaction Setup:
◦ Pipette 20 µL of the RT-PCR master mix into each well of a
PCR plate.
◦ Add 5 µL of RNA sample to each well.
◦ Include a no-template control, a positive control, and a
negative control.
6.3 Thermo Cycling Parameters
• Program the Real-Time PCR Instrument with the following cycling
conditions:
1. Reverse Transcription: 30 min at 50°C
2. Initial Denaturation: 2 min at 95°C
3. 40 Cycles of:
▪ Denaturation: 15 sec at 95°C
▪ Annealing/Extension: 1 min at 60°C
◦ Ensure data acquisition at each extension step.
6.4 Data Analysis and Interpretation
1. Analyze Data:
◦ Use the Real-Time PCR Instrument software to analyze the
amplification curves and determine the cycle threshold (Ct)
values.
◦ Compare Ct values from the sample with those of the
controls to confirm the presence and quantity of BCR/ABL1,
P210 mRNA.
2. Interpret Results:
◦ Report results quantitatively (expressed as the ratio of BCR/
ABL1, P210 mRNA to a reference gene such as ABL1).
◦ If reflex testing is indicated, proceed according to
established laboratory protocols (e.g., testing with an
alternative assay or method to confirm findings).
6.5 Quality Control
• Include positive and negative controls in each run to validate the
test results.
• Perform regular maintenance and calibration of PCR instruments
according to the manufacturer's guidelines.
• Review control results and ensure they fall within acceptable
ranges before releasing patient results.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
• Report results to the clinician as per the laboratory's standard
operating procedure.
• Include a quantitative value of BCR/ABL1, P210 mRNA and
interpretative comments.
• Document and address any deviations or issues encountered
during testing.
