Standard Operating Procedures (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase Protocol for BCR/ABL1, Qualitative, Diagnostic
Assay
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this protocol is to provide detailed procedures for the
qualitative detection of the BCR/ABL1 fusion gene in clinical
specimens, which is critical for the diagnosis of chronic myelogenous
leukemia (CML) and other leukemias. This ensures accurate and
reliable results.
1. SCOPE
This protocol applies to all staff trained in molecular diagnostic
techniques who are responsible for performing the BCR/ABL1,
Qualitative, Diagnostic Assay in the laboratory.
1. RESPONSIBILITIES
• Clinical Laboratory Scientists/Technologists: Perform all steps
of the assay, maintain accurate records, and ensure quality
control.
• Supervisors/Team Leads: Oversee compliance with the
protocol, address any issues, and review results.
• Quality Control Staff: Monitor and document quality control
measures and ensure proper maintenance of equipment.
1. PROCEDURE
4.1 Specimen Handling and Preparation
• Specimen Types: Peripheral blood or bone marrow aspirate.
• Collection and Transport: Collect specimens in EDTA tubes and
transport to the laboratory at room temperature. Specimens
should be tested within 48 hours of collection.
4.2 Reagents and Supplies
• Reagents:
◦ RNA extraction kit
◦ Reverse Transcriptase (RT) enzyme
◦ PCR Master Mix
◦ BCR/ABL1-specific primers and probes
• Supplies:
◦ EDTA blood tubes
◦ Pipettes and tips (RNase/DNase-free)
◦ Microcentrifuge tubes
◦ PCR tubes/plates
◦ Thermal cycler
◦ Real-time PCR instrument
◦ Biosafety cabinet
4.3 Equipment Maintenance and Calibration
• Ensure all equipment is calibrated and maintained as per
manufacturer’s instructions and laboratory schedule.
• Record maintenance activities in the equipment log.
4.4 RNA Extraction
1. Trained staff should perform RNA extraction using the
approved RNA extraction kit according to manufacturer's
instructions.
2. Quality Check: Measure RNA integrity and concentration using
a spectrophotometer or bioanalyzer. Document RNA quality
metrics.
4.5 Reverse Transcription (RT)
1. Set up RT reaction by mixing extracted RNA with reverse
transcriptase and necessary reagents to convert RNA into
complementary DNA (cDNA).
2. Incubate the reaction mix in a thermal cycler according to the
RT protocol.
4.6 PCR Amplification
1. Prepare PCR reaction mix using the supplied PCR Master Mix,
BCR/ABL1-specific primers and probes, and cDNA.
2. Aliquot the reaction mix into PCR tubes or plates.
3. Load PCR tubes/plates into the real-time PCR instrument.
4.7 Real-Time PCR
1. Program the real-time PCR instrument according to the cycling
parameters specific for BCR/ABL1 detection.
2. Run the PCR cycle.
4.8 Data Analysis
1. Software Analysis: Analyze PCR data using the instrument's
software to detect the presence of the BCR/ABL1 fusion gene.
2. Interpretation: Qualitative results are interpreted as positive or
negative based on threshold cycle (Ct) values and control
results.
3. Documentation: Document all findings in the laboratory
information system (LIS).
4.9 Quality Control
1. Include positive and negative controls in each run to ensure
assay validity.
2. Perform periodic proficiency testing and inter-laboratory
comparisons.
3. Record and review quality control data.
4.10 Reporting Results
1. Ensure all result entries are verified by a secondary
technologist or supervisor.
2. Report results through the LIS following standard reporting
guidelines.
3. Include interpretative comments and any limitations of the
assay.
