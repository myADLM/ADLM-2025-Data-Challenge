BCR/ABL1 Qualitative Diagnostic Assay Protocol with Reflex to
BCR/ABL1 P190/P210 Quantitative Assay
1. PURPOSE
To detect the presence of BCR/ABL1 fusion transcripts in patient
samples and reflex to quantification assays for BCR/ABL1 P190 or
P210 as necessary. This protocol ensures precise detection and
accurate quantification of BCR/ABL1 fusion transcripts which are
critical in diagnosing and monitoring BCR-ABL positive leukemias,
including chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and acute
lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).
2. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory personnel trained in molecular diagnostic
techniques are responsible for performing and documenting all steps
of this assay. It is their responsibility to ensure each step is carried
out according to the written procedures to ensure accuracy and
reliability of results.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Acceptable: Peripheral blood or bone marrow cells collected in
EDTA tubes.
• Unacceptable: Clotted specimens, specimens in heparin tubes,
specimens that are not labeled correctly, or specimens received
more than 48 hours post-collection without refrigeration.
4. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Real-time PCR machine
• Nucleic acid extraction kit
• BCR/ABL1 qualitative assay kit
• BCR/ABL1 P190 quantitative assay kit (if reflex required)
• BCR/ABL1 P210 quantitative assay kit (if reflex required)
• Calibrators, controls, and reagents included in respective assay
kits
• Pipettes and filter tips
• Nuclease-free water
• Appropriate PCR consumables
5. PROCEDURE
A. Nucleic Acid Extraction
1. Extract RNA from the patient’s peripheral blood or bone marrow
samples using a validated nucleic acid extraction kit.
2. Follow the manufacturer’s protocol for RNA extraction ensuring
RNA integrity and purity.
3. Measure and document RNA concentration and quality.
B. BCR/ABL1 Qualitative Diagnostic Assay
1. Set up the reverse transcription reaction using the extracted
RNA to synthesize complementary DNA (cDNA).
2. Prepare the PCR reaction mixture according to the BCR/ABL1
qualitative assay kit instructions.
3. Add an appropriate volume of cDNA to the PCR mixture.
4. Load the PCR mixture into the real-time PCR machine.
5. Run the PCR instrument's program as per the manufacturer's
guidelines to amplify the BCR-ABL1 fusion transcripts.
6. Analyze the real-time PCR amplification curves to determine
the presence or absence of BCR/ABL1 fusion transcripts.
7. Document results and evaluate for further reflex testing.
C. Reflex to BCR/ABL1 P190 or P210 Quantitative Assay
1. If BCR/ABL1 fusion transcripts are detected, determine the
appropriate reflex test (BCR/ABL1 P190 or P210 quantification)
based on clinical context or molecular subtype.
2. Set up the quantitative PCR using the BCR/ABL1 P190 or P210
assay kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
3. Add an appropriate volume of cDNA to the quantitative PCR
mixture.
4. Load the PCR mixture into the real-time PCR machine.
5. Run the quantitative PCR program as per the manufacturer's
guidelines to quantify the BCR/ABL1 transcript levels.
6. Generate a quantitative result based on the standard curve
included in the assay.
7. Document the quantitative results for the BCR/ABL1 transcripts.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include both positive and negative controls with each run to
ensure accuracy and specificity.
• Ensure calibration curves are within acceptable ranges.
• Re-run any samples where controls have failed or results appear
anomalous.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
• Report qualitative results as positive or negative for the BCR/
ABL1 fusion transcript.
• Report quantitative results in appropriate measurement units
(e.g., copies/μL, normalized to ABL1 control, etc.).
• Include commentary on the clinical significance of detected BCR/
ABL1 transcript quantities.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Cross-contamination can lead to false positive results.
• Variation in RNA quality can affect assay sensitivity.
• Follow manufacturer guidelines to avoid technical errors that
could compromise results.
