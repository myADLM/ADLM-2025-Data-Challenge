Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for BCR/ABL1, Tyrosine
Kinase Inhibitor Resistance, Kinase Domain Mutation Screen,
Sanger Sequencing, Varies
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the analytical procedures for generating results for
BCR/ABL1, Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor (TKI) Resistance, Kinase
Domain Mutation Screening via Sanger Sequencing. It provides
detailed instructions for the identification of mutations within the
kinase domain of the BCR/ABL1 gene, which are associated with
resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of trained laboratory technologists to perform
the procedures outlined in this document accurately and efficiently,
maintaining compliance with regulatory requirements and laboratory
quality standards. Any deviations or abnormalities encountered
during the procedure must be immediately reported to the laboratory
supervisor.
3. DEFINITIONS
BCR/ABL1: A gene fusion product resulting from the Philadelphia
chromosome translocation, crucial for the diagnosis and monitoring
of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML).
TKI Resistance: Resistance mechanisms to tyrosine kinase inhibitors
used in the treatment of CML.
Kinase Domain Mutation: Mutations within the kinase domain of
BCR/ABL1 that can confer resistance to TKIs.
Sanger Sequencing: A method of DNA sequencing based on the
selective incorporation of chain-terminating dideoxynucleotides
during DNA replication.
4. SPECIMEN AND STORAGE
Specimen Requirements: - Peripheral blood or bone marrow aspirate
collected in EDTA tubes. - Minimum volume: 5 mL for peripheral
blood and 1 mL for bone marrow aspirate.
Storage Conditions: - Specimens should be processed within 24
hours of collection. - If processing is delayed, specimens can be
stored at 4°C for up to 72 hours.
5. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
Equipment: - Thermocycler - Centrifuge - Micro-pipettes and tips -
PCR tubes - Gel electrophoresis apparatus - DNA sequencer -
Cooler block
Reagents: - DNA extraction kit - PCR master mix - Primers specific
for BCR/ABL1 kinase domain - Dideoxynucleotide triphosphates
(ddNTPs) and deoxynucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs) - Sequencing
buffer - Ethanol and isopropanol for DNA precipitation - Molecular-
grade water
6. PROCEDURE
A) DNA Extraction: 1. Extract genomic DNA from the specimen using
a DNA extraction kit as per the manufacturer’s instructions. 2.
Quantitate and assess the purity of the extracted DNA using a
spectrophotometer. 3. Store extracted DNA at -20°C until use.
B) PCR Amplification: 4. Prepare PCR master mix according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. 5. Add primers specific for the BCR/ABL1
kinase domain. 6. Load the master mix into PCR tubes and add DNA
template. 7. Amplify the target region using a thermocycler under the
following conditions: - Initial denaturation: 95°C for 5 minutes - 35
cycles of: - Denaturation: 95°C for 30 seconds - Annealing: 55-60°C
(optimized) for 30 seconds - Extension: 72°C for 1 minute - Final
extension: 72°C for 10 minutes 8. Confirm the amplification by
running an aliquot of PCR product on an agarose gel.
C) Sanger Sequencing: 9. Purify the PCR products using a PCR
purification kit to remove excess primers and nucleotides. 10. Set up
the sequencing reactions in PCR tubes with purified PCR product,
sequencing primers, and sequencing reagents. 11. Perform
sequencing reactions in a thermocycler under the following cycling
conditions: - Initial denaturation: 96°C for 1 minute - 25 cycles of: -
Denaturation: 96°C for 10 seconds - Annealing: 50°C for 5 seconds -
Extension: 60°C for 4 minutes 12. Purify the sequencing reaction
products using ethanol precipitation.
D) Sequence Analysis: 13. Run the purified sequencing products on
a DNA sequencer as per the manufacturer’s instructions. 14. Analyze
the sequencing data using appropriate software to identify mutations
in the kinase domain. 15. Compare the detected mutations with
known resistance mutations database.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
Control Samples: - Include both positive and negative controls in
each PCR and sequencing run to ensure the accuracy and validity of
the results. - Document and review the results of controls before
proceeding with the analysis of patient samples.
Reproducibility: - Perform repeat analysis of at least 10% of the
samples to confirm reproducibility of results. - Maintain records of the
repeat analysis for quality assurance purposes.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
Documentation: - Record all sequencing data, controls, and
observations meticulously. - Verify the accuracy and completeness of
the results before reporting.
Result Interpretation: - Interpret the sequencing results according to
established criteria for the detection of kinase domain mutations. -
Document any detected mutations and their clinical significance in
the patient’s report.
Communication: - Report critical results immediately to the
requesting physician. - Ensure all results are reviewed and
authorized by a qualified laboratory technologist before final release.
