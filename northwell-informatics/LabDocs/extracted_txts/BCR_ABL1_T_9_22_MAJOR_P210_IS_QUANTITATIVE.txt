Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for BCR::ABL1 T(9;22) MAJOR (P210) IS,
Quantitative
1. PURPOSE
To provide detailed instructions for the quantification of BCR::ABL1
fusion gene transcripts (T(9;22) MAJOR (P210)) using the
International Scale (IS) in patient specimens. This procedure ensures
accurate and reliable results for diagnosing, monitoring, and treating
chronic myeloid leukemia (CML).
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the
analysis, documenting results, and adhering to this protocol correctly.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all staff involved in the analysis of
BCR::ABL1 Major (P210) transcripts and includes reagent
preparation, sample processing, data acquisition, and result
reporting.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred Specimens:
• Peripheral blood or bone marrow samples collected in EDTA
tubes.
• Specimens should be processed within 24 hours of collection to
ensure RNA integrity.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed samples.
• Specimens collected in anticoagulants other than EDTA.
• Samples received more than 24 hours post-collection without
proper storage conditions.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Quantitative Real-Time PCR (qRT-PCR) machine capable of
fluorescence detection.
• Microcentrifuge for RNA extraction.
• Vortex mixer.
• Pipettes and filter tips.
Reagents:
• BCR::ABL1 Major (P210) IS specific primers and probes.
• Control primers and probes (ABL).
• Reverse transcription reagents.
• RT-PCR reaction mix.
• RNA extraction kit.
Supplies:
• RNA extraction columns.
• Tubes and PCR plates.
• Nuclease-free water.
• Calibration standards.
5. PROCEDURE
A) RNA Extraction:
1. Process peripheral blood or bone marrow samples according to
the RNA extraction kit instructions.
2. Quantify extracted RNA using a spectrophotometer or
fluorometer and ensure purity (A260/A280 ratio of 1.8-2.0).
B) Reverse Transcription:
1. Set up reverse transcription reactions using provided reagents
to convert RNA to cDNA.
C) qPCR Setup:
1. Prepare reaction mix for qRT-PCR, including master mix,
cDNA, BCR::ABL1 primers/probes, and control ABL primers/
probes.
2. Aliquot reaction mix into the designated PCR plate wells.
3. Ensure calibration standards and controls are included in each
run.
D) PCR Run:
1. Load the PCR plate into the qRT-PCR machine and program
according to the manufacturer's instructions.
2. Run the qPCR and monitor for amplification curves and
fluorescence signals.
E) Data Acquisition:
1. Analyze amplification data and ensure the BCR::ABL1 signal is
quantified relative to the control gene (ABL).
2. Compute the BCR::ABL1/ABL ratio and convert to the
International Scale (IS) using provided formula/calibration data.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
Quality control guidelines must be followed:
• Include positive and negative controls in each run.
• Perform regular calibration on the qRT-PCR machine using
reference standards.
• Verify the integrity of RNA and quality of cDNA.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
Verification:
• Results must be reviewed by the technologist for data integrity
and consistency.
• Ensure the BCR::ABL1 quantification is within expected ranges
and correlates with clinical data.
Documentation:
• Record results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS) for
review and verification.
• Include control and calibration information for quality assurance.
Notification:
• Ensure timely communication of critical results to the appropriate
healthcare personnel.
• Provide comprehensive reporting including BCR::ABL1 percent
ratios and IS values.
