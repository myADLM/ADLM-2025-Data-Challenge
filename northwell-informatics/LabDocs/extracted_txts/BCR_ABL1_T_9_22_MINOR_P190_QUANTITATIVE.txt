STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE BCR::ABL1 T(9;22) MINOR
(P190), QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the detection and
quantification of the BCR::ABL1 T(9;22) MINOR (P190) fusion
transcript in peripheral blood or bone marrow samples using reverse
transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR).
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing
this procedure accurately and maintaining all necessary
documentation.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring all personnel are
adequately trained and all equipment and reagents are
appropriate for use.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STORAGE
Specimen Types:
• Peripheral blood or bone marrow samples collected in EDTA
tubes are acceptable.
Specimen Handling:
• Samples should be processed and RNA extracted as soon as
possible after collection.
• If processing is delayed, store specimens at 2-8°C for up to 24
hours or at -80°C for long-term storage.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, clotted, or improperly labeled specimens.
• Specimens stored more than 24 hours at 2-8°C or not frozen
immediately for long-term storage.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Class II Biosafety Cabinet
• Microcentrifuge
• Real-Time PCR Instrument
• Micropipettes and tips
• Vortex mixer
• Thermal cycler for cDNA synthesis
Reagents and Supplies:
• RNA Extraction Kit
• Reverse Transcriptase Kit
• BCR::ABL1 T(9;22) MINOR (P190) specific primers and probes
• DNase/RNase-free water
• PCR tubes or plates
• Quantitative PCR Master Mix
1. PROCEDURE
4.1 RNA Extraction
1. Isolate total RNA from 1-5 mL of peripheral blood or 1-2 mL of
bone marrow using the RNA Extraction Kit following the
manufacturer's instructions.
2. Assess the quantity and quality of RNA by measuring the A260/
A280 ratio; acceptable purity is 1.8-2.0.
4.2 cDNA Synthesis
1. Prepare cDNA synthesis reactions using the Reverse
Transcriptase Kit and 1 μg of total RNA in a final reaction
volume of 20 μL as per the kit guidelines.
2. Incubate in a thermal cycler under the recommended conditions
(e.g., 42°C for 60 minutes, followed by 70°C for 5 minutes).
4.3 Quantitative PCR
1. Prepare PCR reactions in a sterile area by combining the
following in each PCR tube or well (total volume: 25 μL): • 12.5
μL of 2X Quantitative PCR Master Mix • 1 μL of each primer
(final concentration 400 nM) • 1 μL of BCR::ABL1 probe (final
concentration 200 nM) • 5 μL of cDNA template • 5.5 μL of
DNase/RNase-free water
2. Perform multiplex RT-qPCR assays including housekeeping
gene control (e.g., ABL1).
3. Setup the reaction on the Real-Time PCR Instrument with the
following cycling parameters: • Initial denaturation: 95°C for 10
minutes • 40 cycles of 95°C for 15 seconds, 60°C for 1 minute
4.4 Data Analysis and Interpretation
1. Evaluate the amplification plots and determine the threshold
cycle (Ct) values for the test and control reactions.
2. Normalize the BCR::ABL1 minor transcript levels to the
housekeeping gene control using the ΔCt method.
3. Calculate the relative quantity of BCR::ABL1 minor transcripts
in the sample using the 2^-(ΔΔCt) method.
4.5 Quality Control
1. Include negative and positive controls in each run. Positive
controls should consist of previously quantified RNA known to
contain BCR::ABL1 minor P190 fusion transcript.
2. Negative controls should contain all components except the
RNA template to check for contamination.
4.6 Reporting Results
1. Quantitate BCR::ABL1 minor (P190) fusion transcript levels and
express results as a normalized ratio to the control gene.
2. Document and review results ensuring consistency with quality
control values.
3. Report results in the laboratory information system (LIS)
ensuring all associated data (e.g., method, controls) is
accurately recorded.
