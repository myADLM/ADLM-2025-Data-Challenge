Standard Operating Procedure for the Analytical Phase of BCR/
ABL by FISH Analysis
1. PURPOSE
To describe the procedures involved in the analysis of BCR/ABL
translocations by Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) in an
accurate, reliable, and reproducible manner for diagnostic purposes.
Responsibility:
• The laboratory technologist is responsible for performing the
procedures outlined in this SOP.
• The laboratory supervisor is responsible for verifying that
appropriate quality assurance measures are in place, deficiencies
are corrected, and competency of the personnel performing the
testing is maintained.
1. DEFINITION
BCR/ABL translocation analysis by FISH is used to detect the
presence of the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph chromosome), t(9;22)
(q34;q11) in bone marrow, peripheral blood, or other relevant
samples. This translocation results in the fusion of the BCR gene on
chromosome 22 and the ABL gene on chromosome 9.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Acceptable Specimens:
• Whole blood in EDTA
• Bone marrow aspirate in EDTA
• Fixed cytogenetic slides
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed samples
• Clotted samples
• Specimens with insufficient volume
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Fluorescence microscope with appropriate filter sets
• Hybridization chamber with temperature control
• Incubator set to 37°C
• Humidity chamber
• Thermometer
• FISH probes specific for BCR/ABL translocation
• DAPI (4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) counterstain
• Hybridization buffer
• Wash buffers (0.4x SSC/0.3% NP-40, and 2x SSC)
• Ethanol series (70%, 85%, 100%)
• Lab-grade water
• Immersion oil
1. PROCEDURE
Sample Preparation:
1. Prepare cell suspensions from whole blood or bone marrow
aspirates, ensuring the cells are viable and representative.
2. Centrifuge the sample to obtain a pellet.
3. Fix cells using methanol:acetic acid (3:1) and make cytogenetic
slides from this suspension.
Hybridization:
1. Prepare the slides for hybridization by pretreating them in 2x
SSC buffer at room temperature for 5 minutes.
2. Dehydrate the slides through an ethanol series (70%, 85%,
100%) for 2 minutes in each solution and allow to air dry.
3. Apply the FISH probe mix to the target area of the slides (10µL
per slide).
4. Cover with a coverslip and seal with a rubber cement, place in
a hybridization chamber.
Denaturation and Hybridization:
1. Denature the probes and target DNA by heating the slides at
75°C for 5 minutes.
2. Hybridize the slides at 37°C overnight in a humidity chamber.
Post-Hybridization Wash:
1. Remove coverslips and wash slides in 0.4x SSC/0.3% NP-40 at
72°C for 2 minutes.
2. Rinse in 2x SSC at room temperature for 2 minutes.
3. Dehydrate the slides through an ethanol series (70%, 85%,
100%) for 2 minutes in each solution and allow to air dry.
Counterstaining:
1. Apply DAPI counterstain and mount the slides with antifade
mounting medium.
2. Cover with glass coverslip and allow to dry.
Image Analysis:
1. Examine the slides under a fluorescence microscope using
appropriate filter sets.
2. Score at least 200 interphase nuclei per sample.
3. Identify and document signal patterns:
◦ Normal: 2 orange/green fusion signals
◦ BCR/ABL positive: 1 orange/green fusion signal, 1 separate
orange, and 1 separate green signal
4. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run positive and negative control slides with each batch of patient
samples.
• Verify the hybridization efficiency and signal specificity on control
slides before analyzing patient samples.
• Document control results and review expected controls
periodically to ensure reliable performance.
1. RESULT REPORTING
• Document all findings in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Report the percentage of cells exhibiting the BCR/ABL fusion
signal.
• Flag any critical results and notify the referring clinician
immediately as per standard critical result reporting protocol.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hybridization efficiency can be affected by sample quality.
• Results may be compromised if slides are old or improperly
stored.
• Low-level mosaicism may be difficult to detect accurately.

Note: This SOP must be reviewed and updated annually or
whenever changes in techniques, equipment, or reagents occur.
This document serves the purpose of standardizing FISH analysis for
BCR/ABL translocations, ensuring accurate, reliable, and
reproducible results. Proper adherence to this SOP will aid in
maintaining high standards of diagnostic testing in the laboratory.
