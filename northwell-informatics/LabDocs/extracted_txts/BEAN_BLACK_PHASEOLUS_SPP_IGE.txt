Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
BEAN BLACK (PHASEOLUS SPP) IGE Testing
1. PURPOSE
To provide consistent and reliable procedures for the analysis and
reporting of BEAN BLACK (PHASEOLUS SPP) IGE results in a
CLIA-certified laboratory. This ensures the accuracy, precision, and
repeatability of the test results for clinical diagnosis and patient
management.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of all designated laboratory personnel to follow
this SOP meticulously to ensure the quality of the results.
Supervisors must ensure that the staff is trained and comply with the
SOP.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all staff involved in the processing, analyzing,
and reporting of BEAN BLACK (PHASEOLUS SPP) IGE test results.
3. DEFINITIONS
• BEAN BLACK (PHASEOLUS SPP) IGE: Immunoglobulin E
specific to Black Bean (Phaseolus spp.), an indicator of allergic
response.
• CLIA: Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments.
• LIS: Laboratory Information System.
4. PROCEDURE
4.1 EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) Equipment or
equivalent analyzer with necessary software.
• Reagents: Standard kits for IgE testing specific to BEAN BLACK
(PHASEOLUS SPP).
• Supplies: Microtiter plates, pipettes, micropipette tips, and
controls (positive and negative).
4.2 SAMPLE PREPARATION
• Specimen Type: Serum or Plasma (collected in EDTA or
Heparin).
• Specimen Handling:
◦ Upon receipt, verify the specimen for patient details and
integrity.
◦ Centrifuge at 1,500 x g for 10 minutes at room temperature to
obtain clear serum/plasma.
◦ Store at 2-8°C if the analysis will be performed within 72
hours, otherwise, freeze at -20°C or below for longer storage.
4.3 CALIBRATION AND CONTROLS
• Run calibration standards for specific IgE each day of use and
whenever you open a new reagent batch.
• Include both positive and negative controls with each assay run to
ensure assay validity.
• Acceptable ranges for controls must be defined and met for the
assay results to be valid.
4.4 ASSAY PROCEDURE
1. Preparation:
◦ Allow all reagents, controls, and specimens to reach room
temperature before use.
◦ Thoroughly mix all reagents by gentle inversion.
2. Assay Setup:
◦ Add 100 μL of calibrators, controls, and patient samples to
the designated wells.
◦ Incubate the plate as per manufacturer instructions (typically
60-120 minutes at room temperature).
3. Washing:
◦ Wash the plate multiple times (5-8 times) with the provided
wash buffer to remove unbound materials.
4. Detection:
◦ Add the enzyme-labeled secondary antibody (typically anti-
IgE) to each well, incubate as per protocol.
◦ Wash plate again as per above instructions.
◦ Add the substrate solution and incubate for the
recommended time (usually about 10-30 minutes).
5. Reading:
◦ Stop the reaction with the provided stop solution.
◦ Read the plate at the specified wavelength (typically 450
nm) using the ELISA reader.
6. Calculation:
◦ Generate a standard curve from the calibrators using
software.
◦ Calculate the concentration of BEAN BLACK (PHASEOLUS
SPP) IGE in the patient samples from the standard curve.
4.5 QUALITY CONTROL
• Verify that calibration and quality control metrics are within the
acceptable range.
• If controls do not meet criteria, do not report patient results;
repeat the assay and/or troubleshoot as necessary.
4.6 REPORTING RESULTS
• Review and verify results in the LIS.
• Report results in IU/mL (International Units per Milliliter).
Reference Values:
• Negative: <0.35 IU/mL
• Borderline: 0.35-0.70 IU/mL
• Positive: >0.70 IU/mL
4.7 DOCUMENTATION
• Record all assay details including calibrator values, control
results, and patient values.
• Ensure proper documentation of any deviations from the SOP and
corrective actions taken.
5. TROUBLESHOOTING
• Review the manufacturer's kit insert for specific troubleshooting
guidelines in case of unexpected results or equipment
malfunctions.
6. SAFETY AND WASTE MANAGEMENT
• Follow all laboratory safety protocols, including the use of PPE.
• Dispose of all biological samples and reagents according to
biohazard waste disposal guidelines.
7. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s kit insert for BEAN BLACK (PHASEOLUS SPP)
IGE specific testing.
• CLIA regulations and guidelines.
This SOP ensures that all steps in the analytical phase of generating
BEAN BLACK (PHASEOLUS SPP) IGE results are executed
precisely and reliably, yielding valid and reproducible outcomes
essential for clinical assessment.
