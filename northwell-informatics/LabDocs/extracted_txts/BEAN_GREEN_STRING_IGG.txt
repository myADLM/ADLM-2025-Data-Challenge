Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical
Phase of Generating Results for Bean Green/String IgG
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to provide guidelines for the
analytical phase of generating results for Bean Green/String IgG
testing. This ensures the accuracy, precision, and standardization of
the test process and results.
Responsibility:
The designated laboratory staff are responsible for following this
procedure to ensure the accurate and timely generation of Bean
Green/String IgG test results.
2. DEFINITION
Bean Green/String IgG: An immunoglobulin assay designed to
measure the level of IgG antibodies specific to the Bean Green/String
antigens in patient serum samples.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Microplate Reader capable of measuring absorbance at 450 nm.
• Precision pipettes (single and multi-channel).
• Incubator at 37°C.
• Wash Buffer container and associated washing system.
• Laboratory timer.
Reagents:
• Bean Green/String IgG ELISA Kit, including:
◦ Microtiter plate pre-coated with Bean Green/String antigens.
◦ IgG standards and controls.
◦ Enzyme-conjugated anti-IgG secondary antibody.
◦ Substrate solution.
◦ Stop solution.
◦ Wash buffer.
Supplies:
• Calibrated pipette tips.
• Polypropylene microtubes and racks.
• Disposable gloves.
• Absorbent material for blotting plates.
4. PROCEDURE
4.1. Preparation of Reagents and Samples:
• Allow all reagents, samples, and controls to reach room
temperature (18-25°C) before use.
• Dilute serum samples 1:100 with the sample diluent provided in
the kit, unless otherwise specified.
• Prepare the wash buffer as specified in the kit insert.
4.2. Assay Procedure:
Step 1: Plate Setup
• Securely attach the identified strips of the microtiter plate within
the frame.
• Allocate wells for standards, controls, and patient samples as
required.
Step 2: Addition of Samples and Standards
• Add 100 µL of standards into the designated standard wells.
• Add 100 µL of diluted patient samples to the appropriate wells.
• Include a blank well with 100 µL of the sample diluent without any
antibody for background subtraction.
Step 3: Incubation
• Cover the plate with adhesive film or lids compatible with the
microplate reader.
• Incubate the plate at 37°C for 30 minutes.
Step 4: Washing
• Wash the plate 3 times with the prepared wash buffer, ensuring
the wells are emptied completely after each wash.
Step 5: Addition of Enzyme-Conjugated Antibody
• Add 100 µL of the enzyme-conjugated anti-IgG antibody to each
well.
• Cover and incubate at 37°C for 30 minutes.
Step 6: Washing
• Wash the plate 3 times with the wash buffer.
Step 7: Substrate Reaction
• Add 100 µL of substrate solution to each well.
• Incubate at room temperature for 15 minutes in the dark.
Step 8: Reaction Termination
• Add 50 µL of stop solution to each well to terminate the reaction.
Step 9: Reading the Plate
• Read the plate at 450 nm using a microplate reader.
4.3 Result Calculation:
• Calculate the mean absorbance for each standard, control, and
patient sample.
• Construct a standard curve by plotting the absorbance values of
the standards against the known concentrations.
• Determine the concentration of IgG in patient samples by
interpolation from the standard curve.
• Ensure results are within the expected ranges for validity. If not,
repeat the assay or perform necessary troubleshooting as
indicated in the kit insert or by lab supervisor.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run controls with each assay batch to ensure assay performance.
• If the control values fall outside the expected ranges, identify
potential errors and repeat the assay.
• Document all results and notify the supervisor of any
discrepancies.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
following standard reporting guidelines.
• Verify and validate the results before releasing them.
7. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Refer to established laboratory reference intervals specific to Bean
Green/String IgG, provided in the test kit insert or other validated
sources.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Assure all limitations as described in the Bean Green/String IgG
ELISA kit insert are observed.
• Take note of potential interferences, such as hemolysis or lipidic
serum, that may affect test results.
9. REFERENCES

or updated protocols are reviewed and incorporated under the
supervision and direction of the lab manager.
