Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for BEAN KIDNEY IgG Testing
1. PURPOSE
To define the process for the analytical phase of BEAN KIDNEY IgG
testing, ensuring accuracy, reliability, and timeliness of test results.
This involves the analysis of patient samples to detect and quantify
Immunoglobulin G (IgG) specific to bean kidney antigens.
1. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel performing BEAN
KIDNEY IgG testing in the clinical laboratory.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of trained laboratory personnel to follow this
SOP. Supervisor ensures compliance with this procedure and
addresses any deviations or issues.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type: Serum Preferred Volume: 2 mL Minimum Volume: 1
mL Specimen Stability:
• Room Temperature: 24 hours
• Refrigerated (2-8°C): 7 days
• Frozen (-20°C or lower): 1 month
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Grossly hemolyzed, lipemic or icteric samples
• Specimens with insufficient volume
• Contaminated specimens
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• ELISA Reader
• Microplate Washer
• Pipettes (single and multichannel)
• Incubator
Reagents:
• BEAN KIDNEY IgG ELISA Kit (Store at 2-8°C)
• ELISA wash buffer
• Substrate solution
• Stop solution
• Primary and secondary antibodies
Supplies:
• 96-well ELISA microplates
• Pipette tips
• Well sealing covers
• Calibrated microcentrifuge
1. CALIBRATION AND QUALITY CONTROL
Calibration:
• Calibrate ELISA Reader according to the manufacturer’s
instructions before use.
• Use standard calibrators provided in the ELISA kit.
Quality Control (QC):
• Include negative and positive controls with each run.
• Ensure that QC values fall within the manufacturer’s acceptable
range; investigate and resolve deviations before proceeding.
1. PROCEDURE
7.1 Preparation:
• Allow reagents and samples to reach room temperature before
use.
• Label all tubes and plates accordingly.
7.2 Sample Preparation:
• Thaw frozen samples at room temperature. Mix gently and
centrifuge at 5000 rpm for 10 minutes if visible particles are
present.
7.3 Assay Procedure:
• Add 100 µL of the appropriate standards, controls, and patient
samples to designated wells in duplicate.
• Incubate the microplate at 37°C for 60 minutes.
• Aspirate and wash each well three times with the ELISA wash
buffer.
• Add 100 µL of conjugate to each well. Incubate at 37°C for 30
minutes.
• Aspirate and wash each well five times with the ELISA wash
buffer.
• Add 100 µL of substrate solution to each well. Incubate in the dark
at room temperature for 15 minutes.
• Add 100 µL of stop solution to each well and mix gently.
7.4 Reading:
• Read the absorbance at 450 nm using the ELISA Reader within
30 minutes of stopping the reaction.
1. RESULTS INTERPRETATION
• Calculate the average absorbance for each set of duplicate
standards, controls, and samples.
• Generate a calibration curve from the standards and determine
the IgG concentration of patient samples.
• Reference values: Results to be evaluated based on established
clinical reference ranges.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Document all results and QC data.
• Enter validated results into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
• Verify and release results.
• Flag abnormal or critical values and notify the attending
healthcare provider as per established protocol.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the manufacturer's insert for detailed information regarding
reagent stability, potential interferences, and assay performance
limitations.
