Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for BEAN LIMA (PHASEOLUS LIMENSIS) IgE
1. PURPOSE
To ensure proper procedures are followed in the analytical phase for
the generation of results for Bean Lima (Phaseolus limensis) IgE
testing, ensuring accuracy, reliability, and consistency in the results
reported.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory staff are responsible for following this SOP
during the analytical phase.
• It is the responsibility of all staff to verify compliance with the SOP
and report any anomalies to the laboratory supervisor.
1. DEFINITION
Bean Lima (Phaseolus limensis) IgE: Immunoglobulin E (IgE) specific
to allergens present in Phaseolus limensis, commonly known as Lima
Bean.
1. PROCEDURE
A) Specimen Handling:
• Ensure specimen has been received and accessioned properly.
• Verify patient information on the specimen matches the
requisition.
• Refrigerated specimens should be brought to room temperature
prior to testing.
• Ensure specimens are properly stored and free from
contamination.
B) Reagents and Supplies:
• Allergen-specific IgE testing reagents and kits (as specified by the
manufacturer).
• Control material and calibrators for quality control.
• Necessary laboratory equipment (e.g., pipettes, microcentrifuge
tubes).
C) Equipment Validation and Maintenance:
• Ensure that all equipment (e.g., analyzers, centrifuges) are
calibrated and maintained as per manufacturer guidelines.
• Document equipment maintenance and calibration status prior to
use.
D) Analytical Procedure:
1. Preparation:
◦ Set up necessary reagents as per manufacturer instructions.
◦ Prepare control samples and calibrators to establish a
baseline for the test.
2. Testing:
◦ Add the specimen to the analyzer per manufacturer’s
protocol ensuring proper loading and tracking.
◦ Initiate the IgE test run and monitor the analyzer for any
alerts or malfunctions.
◦ Ensure that external temperature dependent equipment
(e.g., incubators) is operating within specified limits.
3. Quality Control:
◦ Run control samples alongside patient specimens, ensuring
results fall within established control limits.
◦ Document control results, re-test if control fails, and follow
troubleshooting protocols.
4. Result Generation:
◦ Upon completion of the test run, review the analyzer’s
output for completeness and consistency.
◦ Verify results against control sample outcomes to ensure
accuracy.
E) Recording and Reporting:
1. Documentation:
◦ Record calculated IgE values in the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
◦ Ensure patient data is accurately entered and tracked.
◦ Document any anomalies and corrective actions taken.
2. Reporting:
◦ Verify and validate results before final reporting.
◦ Use established reference intervals to interpret IgE levels.
◦ Report critical values promptly as per laboratory protocol.
F) Quality Assurance:
• Regularly review and update SOPs to ensure compliance with
best practices.
• Participate in external proficiency testing.
• Perform regular audits of procedure adherence and implement
corrective actions as necessary.
G) Troubleshooting:
• Address equipment malfunctions or irregularities promptly.
• Review specimen integrity and repeat the test if required.
• Consult the laboratory supervisor for guidance on unresolved
issues.
H) References:
• Manufacturer's insert and instruction manual for allergen-specific
IgE kits and analyzers.
• Internal quality control guidelines.
• Laboratory procedure manual.
By adhering to these procedures, laboratory staff will ensure the
accuracy and reliability of Bean Lima IgE testing results, maintaining
high standards of patient care and laboratory practice.
