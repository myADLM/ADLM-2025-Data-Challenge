Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analysis of BEAN
NAVY/WHITE IGG
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this SOP is to establish a standardized
procedure for the analysis of BEAN NAVY/WHITE IGG
(Immunoglobulin G). This protocol ensures consistency, accuracy,
and reliability of the test results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory personnel (including technologists and
supervisors) are responsible for:
• Carrying out the BEAN NAVY/WHITE IGG analysis according to
this SOP.
• Ensuring proper documentation of the procedure and results.
• Identifying and addressing any deficiencies or anomalies
encountered during analysis.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/Acceptable Specimen:
• Serum obtained from venous blood collection.
• Blood should be collected into a red-top tube (no additive) or an
SST (serum separator tube).
• Allow the blood to clot at room temperature for 30 minutes and
then centrifuge for 10 minutes at 1500 x g to separate serum.
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Specimens showing signs of hemolysis or lipemia.
• Specimens with incomplete or incorrect labeling.
• Specimens that have not been processed and stored according to
standard protocols (e.g., delays in centrifugation or improper
storage).
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• BEAN NAVY/WHITE IGG test kit (manufacturer-specific)
• Micropipettes and tips
• Centrifuge
• Incubator (37°C)
• Vortex mixer
• Standard laboratory glassware (test tubes, beakers, etc.)
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
5. PROCEDURE
A. Calibration and QC:
1. Perform calibration of the equipment using BEAN NAVY/WHITE
IGG calibrators according to the manufacturer's instructions.
2. Run quality control (QC) samples (Low, Medium, High) before
running patient specimens. Ensure QC results fall within the
acceptable range.
3. Document QC results in the QC log.
B. Sample Preparation and Testing:
1. Label test tubes appropriately with patient identification.
2. Pipette 100 µL of patient serum into the designated wells or
tubes as specified by the BEAN NAVY/WHITE IGG test kit
protocol.
3. Add 100 µL of the provided diluent or buffer to each well
containing the patient sample. Mix gently using a vortex mixer.
4. Incubate the plates or tubes at 37°C for 30 minutes unless
otherwise specified by the test kit instructions.
5. Wash the wells or tubes with the provided wash buffer,
repeating the wash cycle three times to remove any unbound
serum components.
6. Add 100 µL of the enzyme-linked secondary antibody to each
well or tube.
7. Incubate again at 37°C for 30 minutes.
8. Perform another wash cycle to remove unbound secondary
antibody.
9. Add 100 µL of the substrate solution to each well or tube. Allow
color to develop at room temperature for 15 minutes, protected
from direct light.
10. Measure the absorbance using an ELISA reader at the
recommended wavelength (usually 450 nm).
C. Result Calculation:
1. Generate a standard curve using the calibrator absorbance
values.
2. Determine the concentration of BEAN NAVY/WHITE IGG in
each patient sample by plotting absorbance values on the
standard curve.
3. Document the calculated concentrations in the patient result
log.
6. ANALYTICAL LIMITATIONS AND INTERPRETATIONS
• Hemolysis, lipemia, or icterus in serum samples can interfere with
accurate measurement.
• Cross-reactivity with other immunoglobulins or substances may
lead to erroneous results; refer to the manufacturer’s insert for
specific interferents.
• Results should always be interpreted in conjunction with clinical
findings and other laboratory tests.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results are reviewed and verified by the technologist.
• Enter verified results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
and ensure accurate transmission to the patient’s medical record.
• Any critical values or unexpected results should be promptly
communicated to the clinician as per laboratory's critical result
policy.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform internal quality control according to manufacturer
guidelines and document in the QC log.
• Participate in external proficiency testing as mandated by
laboratory management and accreditation bodies to ensure the
accuracy of test results.
