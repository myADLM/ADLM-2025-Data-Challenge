Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase: BEAN
NAVY/WHITE (PHASEOLUS VULGARIS) IGE Testing
1. PURPOSE
This procedure outlines the steps necessary to perform BEAN NAVY/
WHITE (PHASEOLUS VULGARIS) IGE testing to ensure accurate
and reliable results. This testing is essential for the diagnosis of IgE-
mediated allergic responses to navy/white beans in patients.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory staff are responsible for
performing BEAN NAVY/WHITE (PHASEOLUS VULGARIS) IGE
tests following the procedures specified in this SOP. Staff must
ensure adherence to quality control measures and correct
documentation.
1. SAMPLE REQUIREMENTS
Preferred Sample:
• Serum: 1-2 mL collected in a red top or SST (serum separator
tube), transported to the laboratory immediately.
Unacceptable Samples:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
• Samples collected in anticoagulants (e.g., EDTA, citrate, heparin).
• Samples that are mishandled or not stored properly.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• ImmunoCAP™ Allergen M3 Phl p 4 Reagent (other commercially
available kits may be used as applicable)
• Calibration Standards
• Quality Control (QC) materials: low, medium, and high controls
• Micropipettes and tips
• Incubator set at 37°C
• Centrifuge
• Timer
• Vortex mixer
• Laboratory glassware and disposable containers
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
• Laboratory Information System (LIS) for result entry and reporting
1. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation:
• Allow the serum sample to equilibrate to room temperature before
use.
• Mix the sample gently using a vortex mixer.
• Centrifuge the sample at 1,500 x g for 10 minutes to remove any
particulate matter.
B. Calibration:
• Ensure that all reagents and calibrators are within their expiration
dates.
• Perform calibration using the standards provided with the
ImmunoCAP™ Allergen M3 Phl p 4 Reagent kit. Refer to the kit
insert for specific details on the calibration procedure.
• Document calibration results in the instrument log.
C. Quality Control:
• Analyze at least one level of QC material (low, medium, high) with
each assay run.
• Record QC results, and ensure they fall within the specified
acceptable range before continuing with sample testing.
• If QC results fall outside acceptable limits, initiate troubleshooting
procedures and do not proceed with sample testing until resolved.
D. Testing Procedure:
• Label the appropriate number of reaction wells for each patient
sample, control, and calibrator.
• Add 50 µL of the patient's serum sample to each well.
• Add 50 µL of buffer reagent to each well.
• Incubate at 37°C for 30 minutes.
• Wash the wells thoroughly with the wash buffer to remove any
unbound substances (3-5 wash cycles).
• Add 50 µL of enzyme conjugate to each well.
• Incubate at 37°C for an additional 30 minutes.
• Wash the wells again following the same washing steps.
• Add 50 µL of substrate solution provided with the kit and incubate
for 10 minutes at room temperature in the dark.
• Add 50 µL of stop solution to each well to terminate the reaction.
E. Reading and Interpretation:
• Measure the optical density (OD) of each well using an ELISA
plate reader set to the recommended wavelength (usually 450 nm
with a reference of 620-630 nm).
• Compare the OD readings of patient samples against the
calibration curve to determine the IgE concentration.
• Document the results in the LIS for review and final interpretation.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Include the results with required details: patient ID, sample ID,
test performed, and numeric results in IU/mL.
• If any results fall outside the linear range or are flagged by the
system, apply appropriate follow-up actions such as repeat testing
or sample integrity check.
• Report critical or abnormal results immediately to the referring
healthcare provider as per laboratory policy.
1. QUALITY ASSURANCE
• Perform regular maintenance and calibration of equipment
according to the manufacturer's recommendations.
• Participate in external quality assurance programs to ensure the
accuracy and reliability of testing.
• Maintain complete and accurate documentation of all testing
procedures, calibrations, QC results, and maintenance logs.

1. SAFETY
• Follow all laboratory safety protocols, including the use of PPE
and proper disposal of biohazardous materials.
• Ensure that all work with human specimens is conducted within a
biosafety level 2 (BSL-2) environment.
