Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: BECKWITH-WIEDEMANN SYNDROME/RUSSELL-SILVER
SYNDROME, MOLECULAR ANALYSIS, VARIES
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for the molecular analysis of Beckwith-
Wiedemann Syndrome (BWS) and Russell-Silver Syndrome (RSS)
using various suitable technologies and methodologies, ensuring
high accuracy, sensitivity, and consistency of results.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of the laboratory personnel to adhere to this
protocol and ensure all steps are followed accurately. The laboratory
supervisor must review and validate the results.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to the molecular analysis of patients with suspected
Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome (BWS) and Russell-Silver
Syndrome (RSS).
3. MATERIALS, EQUIPMENT, AND REAGENTS
• DNA Extraction Kits
• Quantitative PCR (qPCR) Machine
• Methylation-Specific PCR (MS-PCR) Kit
• DNA Methylation Arrays
• Bisulfite Conversion Kits
• Primers and Probes specific for BWS/RSS loci
• Nuclease-free water
• Ethanol (70%, 90-100%)
• Microcentrifuge
• Vortex Mixer
• Thermal Cycler
4. PROCEDURE
4.1. DNA Extraction
• Extract DNA from peripheral blood, buccal swabs, or other
specimens using a validated DNA extraction kit.
• Quantify DNA using a spectrophotometer or fluorometer and
ensure the DNA concentration is suitable for downstream
applications.
• Store extracted DNA at -20°C or -80°C until further analysis.
Ensure that the DNA is stable and free from contaminants.
4.2. Bisulfite Conversion
• Convert genomic DNA (500 ng - 1 µg) using a commercial
bisulfite conversion kit to distinguish between methylated and
unmethylated cytosines.
• Follow the manufacturer's protocol for complete conversion.
• Purify the converted DNA as per the kit's instructions and quantify
it again to ensure there is sufficient amount for further analysis.
4.3. Methylation-Specific PCR (MS-PCR)
• Design primers and probes specific to the differentially methylated
regions (DMRs) associated with BWS and RSS.
• Prepare the MS-PCR mix by combining bisulfite-treated DNA,
primers, probes, and PCR master mix.
• Perform MS-PCR using a thermal cycler with the following cycling
parameters:
◦ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 10 minutes
◦ 40 cycles of: 95°C for 15 seconds, 55-60°C (based on primer
Tm) for 30 seconds, 72°C for 30 seconds
◦ Final extension: 72°C for 7 minutes
• Analyze the PCR products via gel electrophoresis or real-time
PCR detection.
4.4. Quantitative PCR (qPCR)
• Prepare a qPCR mix with DNA, primers, and probes specifically
targeting BWS/RSS loci.
• Perform qPCR with the following cycling conditions:
◦ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 10 minutes
◦ 40 cycles of: 95°C for 15 seconds, 60°C for 60 seconds
• Analyze data for differential methylation patterns using the
appropriate qPCR software.
4.5. DNA Methylation Array
• For an in-depth methylation analysis, use a DNA methylation
array kit.
• Follow manufacturer’s instructions for hybridization, washing,
staining, and scanning the arrays.
• Analyze array data to identify DNA methylation patterns
characteristic of BWS or RSS.
4.6. Data Analysis and Interpretation
• Interpret results based on differential methylation patterns at
imprinted loci known to be implicated in BWS and RSS (e.g.,
KCNQ1OT1, H19).
• Conclusions should be made considering the patient’s clinical
features and family history.
• Ensure the quality control criteria are met before releasing results.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include positive and negative controls in each batch of testing to
ensure the reliability of results.
• Regularly perform quality checks on equipment and reagents to
ensure proper functioning and accuracy.
• Log all controls, including any observed deviations and the steps
taken to correct them.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
• Report results following laboratory-specific protocols, ensuring
that they are reviewed and validated by a qualified supervisor.
• Include clear interpretation of the results and, if necessary,
recommendations for further testing or genetic counseling.
