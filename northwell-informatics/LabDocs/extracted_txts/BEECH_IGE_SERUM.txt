STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase of Generating Results for Blood Ethanol
(BEECH), Immunoglobulin E (IgE), and Serum
1. PURPOSE:
To outline the protocol for the analytical phase of generating results
for Blood Ethanol (BEECH), Immunoglobulin E (IgE), and routine
serum testing to ensure consistent, accurate, and reliable test results.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory personnel, including laboratory technologists
and supervisors, are responsible for performing and documenting the
steps outlined in this procedure.
2. PROCEDURE:
2.1 Blood Ethanol (BEECH) Analysis:
Specimen Requirements:
• Preferred Specimen: Serum or plasma (collected in sodium
fluoride/potassium oxalate tube).
• Volume: Minimum 3 mL.
• Stability: Stable for 14 days at 4-8°C.
Equipment and Reagents:
• Gas Chromatograph/Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS) or enzymatic
method analyzer.
• Ethanol standard controls and calibrators.
• Internal standard (n-propanol or equivalent).
Procedure:
1. Preparation: Ensure all reagents and equipment are ready and
properly calibrated.
2. Specimen Processing: Centrifuge specimen tubes at
2000-2500 RPM for 10 minutes. Transfer plasma/serum to a
clean, labeled centrifuge tube.
3. Sample Preparation: Add internal standard to patient samples,
calibrators, and control samples.
4. Analysis:
◦ For GC/MS: Inject the prepared sample into the gas
chromatograph and start the run program.
◦ For enzymatic methods: Load the samples onto the
analyzer and start the program according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
5. Quality Control: Analyze control samples at the beginning,
middle, and end of the batch. Confirmation of results should fall
within acceptable ranges.
6. Data Processing: Review and save chromatograms or
analyzer output results. Ensure proper integration of the ethanol
peak or endpoint reading.
7. Reporting: Enter results into the Laboratory Information
System (LIS) for review and verification by the technologist.
2.2 Immunoglobulin E (IgE) Analysis:
Specimen Requirements:
• Preferred Specimen: Serum (collected in a red or serum
separator tube).
• Volume: Minimum 1 mL.
• Stability: Stable for 7 days at 2-8°C, or 1 month at -20°C if
frozen.
Equipment and Reagents:
• Automated immunoassay analyzer (e.g., ImmunoCAP, ELISA
reader).
• IgE calibrators, quality controls, and specific reagents.
Procedure:
1. Preparation: Ensure all reagents, controls, and calibrators are
brought to room temperature and prepared according to
manufacturer's instructions.
2. Specimen Processing: Centrifuge specimen tubes at 1500
RPM for 10 minutes. Pipette serum into clean, labeled
microtubes.
3. Sample Loading:
◦ For ImmunoCAP: Load the calibrators, controls, and patient
samples onto the system in identified positions.
◦ For ELISA: Pipette the prescribed volume of serum,
controls, and calibrators into designated wells.
4. Running the Assay:
◦ ImmunoCAP: Initiate the run protocol on the system.
◦ ELISA: Add reagents, incubate, wash, and develop color
according to the manufacturer's protocol.
5. Quality Control: Include and analyze quality control samples
to verify the assay’s validity. Results should fall within the
predefined acceptance criteria.
6. Data Acquisition:
◦ ImmunoCAP: Results are read directly by the system.
◦ ELISA: Read the optical density of the wells using an ELISA
plate reader.
7. Reporting: Review results for accuracy and transcribe to the
LIS for validation.
2.3 Routine Serum Analysis:
Specimen Requirements:
• Preferred Specimen: Serum (collected in a red top or serum
separator tube).
• Volume: Variable, typically 5 mL.
• Stability: Typically stable for up to 3 days at 2-8°C, depending on
the specific test.
Common Tests Include:
• Basic Metabolic Panel (BMP),
• Comprehensive Metabolic Panel (CMP),
• Lipid profile, Liver function tests, etc.
Equipment and Reagents:
• Automated chemistry analyzer.
• Specific reagent cartridges, calibrators, and quality controls.
Procedure:
1. Preparation: Calibrate the chemistry analyzer and ensure
reagents and controls are loaded correctly.
2. Specimen Processing: Centrifuge specimen tubes at
1500-2000 RPM for 10 minutes. Pipette serum into analysis
cups.
3. Sample Loading: Place patient samples, controls, and
calibrators into the designated slots of the analyzer.
4. Analysis:
◦ Select the test profile on the analyzer.
◦ Initiate the run protocol.
5. Quality Control: Include appropriate quality control samples in
each run (beginning, middle, end).
6. Data Review: Inspect the analyzer's output for any flagged
results or errors.
7. Reporting: Enter results into the LIS. Evaluate and verify
results according to established laboratory guidelines.
3. QUALITY ASSURANCE:
• Perform bi-weekly internal quality control to ensure accuracy and
reliability of analytical results.
• Validate new lots of reagents or calibrators with patient sample
comparisons.
• Document any deviations and corrective actions in the laboratory
log.
4. DOCUMENTATION AND RECORD KEEPING:
• Maintain accurate logs of temperature, quality control results, and
calibration records.
• Document all results, including quality control outcomes, in the
LIS or designated laboratory software.
• Ensure that all patient results receive proper review and validation
before reporting.
5. REFERENCES:
• Analyzer-specific operator manuals.
• Manufacturer's reagent and calibration instructions.
• Internal laboratory guidelines for quality control and result
validation.
This protocol should be reviewed annually or upon the introduction of
new methods or equipment to ensure it remains current and effective.
Any changes or updates will be documented, and relevant laboratory
personnel will be trained accordingly.
