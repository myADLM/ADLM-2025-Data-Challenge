1. PURPOSE
To ensure the accurate and reliable analysis of BEEF-specific IgE
levels in serum samples, employing standardized procedures to
generate and verify results.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory staff are responsible for following this
protocol to analyze serum samples for BEEF-specific IgE.
• Laboratory supervisors are responsible for ensuring that staff
adhere to this protocol and for reviewing and verifying the results.
1. DEFINITION
BEEF-specific IgE: Immunoglobulin E antibodies specific to proteins
found in beef.
1. PROCEDURE
A) Specimen Requirements and Stability:
• Specimen type: Serum
• Collection: Collect blood using standard venipuncture techniques.
• Volume: Minimum 1 mL serum.
• Stability: Specimen stable for 7 days at 2-8°C. For longer storage,
serum can be frozen at -20°C or lower for up to 6 months.
Unacceptable specimen criteria:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples may interfere with testing
accuracy.
• Specimens not labeled with the patient’s identification and
collection date/time.
B) Equipment, Reagents and Supplies:
1. ELISA Reader or equivalent
2. Centrifuge
3. Collection tubes (serum separator tubes, SST)
4. BEEF-specific IgE ELISA kit or equivalent
5. Calibration standards, controls, and antibody reagents as
provided in the ELISA kit
C) Reagent Preparation:
• Reconstitute and prepare all reagents, standards, and controls
according to the manufacturer’s instructions provided in the ELISA
kit.
D) Calibration and Quality Control:
1. Calibration:
• Run calibration standards with each batch of samples processed.
Follow the Elisa Kit instructions to ensure accurate calibration.
• Use a minimum of three to five levels of calibrators to plot the
standard curve.
1. Quality Control:
• Include at least two levels of quality control (QC) samples, one
within the normal range and one high (e.g., obtained from Kenlor
Industries).
• Run controls at the beginning of each analysis batch and after
calibration.
• Validate and record QC results; QC should be within an
acceptable range. If QC fails, troubleshoot before proceeding with
patient samples.
E) Analysis Procedure:
1. Serum Preparation:
• Centrifuge the collected SST tubes at 1600-2000 x g for 10-15
minutes to separate serum.
• Collect the serum layer carefully without disturbing the cell layer.
• Aliquot serum into labeled tubes for testing.
1. Assay Execution:
• Allow reagents and samples to reach room temperature before
starting the assay.
• Perform ELISA according to the steps outlined in the BEEF-
specific IgE ELISA kit insert: i. Add sample, calibrators, and
controls to the appropriate wells. ii. Perform incubation steps as
per kit instructions. iii. Add enzyme-labeled antibody reagent. iv.
Wash plates thoroughly to minimize background. v. Add the
substrate solution and stop solution. vi. Measure the optical
density (OD) at the specified wavelength using an ELISA reader.
1. Calculation of Results:
• Construct a standard curve by plotting the mean OD
measurements of the calibrators against their known
concentrations.
• Use the standard curve to determine the IgE concentration in
patient samples.
• Ensure all calculations align with the software or procedural
algorithm provided by the ELISA kit.
F) Reporting Results:
• Result verification: The technologist must review the results for
accuracy and consistency.
• Report IgE concentrations in specific units (e.g., kUA/L) in
accordance with the laboratory information system (LIS) and
clinical reference ranges.
• Reference Intervals (Manufacturer dependent): Generally, ≤ 0.35
kUA/L is considered negative; results >0.35 kUA/L indicate
sensitivity.
G) Sample Integrity and Troubleshooting:
• Visually inspect samples for signs of hemolysis, lipemia, or icterus
and note any potential interference.
• If sample integrity is in question, request a repeat collection.
• Trouble-shooting: Re-run any questionable samples or controls.
Document the issue, actions taken, and outcomes.
Critical Results:
• Follow the laboratory policy for reporting critically high levels of
IgE, ensuring prompt communication with the requesting
physician or healthcare provider.
