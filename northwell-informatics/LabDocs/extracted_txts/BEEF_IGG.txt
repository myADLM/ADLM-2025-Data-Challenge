Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical
Phase of BEEF IGG Testing
1. PURPOSE
To provide detailed steps and procedures for generating accurate
and reliable results for BEEF IGG testing in a CLIA-certified
laboratory. This protocol outlines the responsibilities, equipment,
reagents, procedures, and quality control measures necessary for the
analytical phase of BEEF IGG testing.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel performing BEEF IGG
testing and covers procedures from sample preparation until the
generation and verification of results.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated staff are responsible for performing BEEF IGG testing
according to this SOP. It is the responsibility of all laboratory
personnel to ensure the accuracy of test results and to report any
discrepancies or issues to the supervisor.
4. DEFINITION
BEEF IGG: Immunoglobulin G specific to bovine proteins detected in
human serum, used for identifying food allergies related to beef.
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred Specimen: 5 mL human serum
• Specimen Stability:
◦ Room Temperature: up to 24 hours
◦ Refrigerated (2-8°C): up to 7 days
◦ Frozen (-20°C or colder): up to 30 days
• Unacceptable Specimens: Specimens that are hemolyzed,
lipemic, or collected in improper containers.
6. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• ELISA Reader (or equivalent analytical equipment)
• Pipettes and tips
• Microplate washer
• BEEF IGG ELISA Kit
◦ BEEF IGG standards and controls
◦ BEEF IGG specific antibody-coated microplate
• Incubator set at 37°C
• Deionized water
• Laboratory timer
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
7. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation
1. Pre-warm the Incubator: Set the incubator to 37°C at least 30
minutes prior to starting the assay.
2. Reagent Preparation: Prepare reagents and solutions
provided in the BEEF IGG ELISA kit as per manufacturer's
instructions.
B. Assay Procedure
1. Sample Addition:
◦ Apply 100μL of standards, controls, and specimens into the
respective wells of the microplate.
2. Incubation:
◦ Cover the plate and incubate at 37°C for 30 minutes.
3. Washing:
◦ Wash the microplate using the microplate washer. Repeat
wash steps as indicated in the kit instructions.
4. Secondary Antibody Addition:
◦ Apply 100μL of enzyme-linked secondary antibody to each
well and incubate at 37°C for another 30 minutes.
5. Second Washing:
◦ Wash the plate again to remove unbound secondary
antibody.
6. Substrate Addition:
◦ Add 100μL of substrate solution to each well and incubate at
room temperature (20-25°C) for 15 minutes in the dark.
7. Stop Reaction:
◦ Add 50μL of stop solution to each well to terminate the
reaction.
8. Measurement:
◦ Read the optical density of each well at 450 nm using the
ELISA reader.
C. Result Calculation and Interpretation
1. Calibration Curve:
◦ Generate a calibration curve using the standards provided in
the kit.
2. Sample Calculation:
◦ Calculate the concentration of BEEF IGG in each sample
relative to the calibration curve.
3. Result Documentation:
◦ Ensure all results are documented properly in the
designated log sheets or electronic reporting systems.
D. Quality Control
1. Controls:
◦ Run both positive and negative controls with every batch of
tests to validate the assay performance.
2. QC Documentation:
◦ Record all control results in the QC log.
3. Corrective Actions:
◦ If controls are out of the acceptable range, troubleshoot the
procedure and repeat the assay if necessary, and notify the
supervisor.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Ensure all results are reviewed and verified by the technologist.
• Report results following site-specific reporting guidelines.
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to the BEEF IGG ELISA kit insert for specific limitations of
the assay.
• Factors such as hemolysis, lipemia, or improper specimen
handling may affect the accuracy of the results.

This SOP is effective immediately and must be adhered to by all
laboratory personnel involved in BEEF IGG testing. Ensure regular
review and updates as needed to maintain accuracy and compliance
with regulatory standards.
