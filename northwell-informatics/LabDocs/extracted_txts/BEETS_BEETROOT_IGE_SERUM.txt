Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for BEETS (BEETROOT)
and IGE, SERUM Analysis
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for analyzing BEETS (BEETROOT) and
Immunoglobulin E (IGE) in serum samples, ensuring accurate and
reliable results are generated while maintaining compliance with CLIA
standards.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of all trained and certified laboratory
technologists to follow this SOP for the analytical phase. The
Laboratory Supervisor is responsible for overseeing the
implementation of the procedure and ensuring quality control.
1. DEFINITIONS
BEETS (BEETROOT): BEETROOT specific analytes or components
(specifics should be defined based on testing such as nitrate levels,
pigments, or other biomarkers as relevant).
IgE: Immunoglobulin E, an antibody that plays a crucial role in the
immune response, particularly in allergic reactions.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
BEETS (BEETROOT) Analysis:
• Specimen Type: Fresh or frozen whole blood, serum, or plasma
as specified.
• Volume: At least 1 mL of serum or plasma is required for
analysis.
• Stability: Serum/plasma specimens are stable for up to 72 hours
at 2-8°C. For long-term storage, keep samples at -20°C or colder.
IgE Analysis:
• Specimen Type: Serum.
• Volume: 1 mL minimum.
• Stability: Serum is stable for up to 7 days at 2-8°C. For long-term
storage, freeze serum at -20°C or lower.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS & SUPPLIES
General:

• Freezer (-20°C or below)
• Refrigerator (2-8°C)
• Micropipettes and tips
• Laboratory timer
• Vortex mixer
BEETS (BEETROOT) Analysis:
• Specific reagents for targeted analytes (e.g., Nitrate Reduction
Reagents, Chromogenic Substrates)
• Analytical instruments (e.g., Spectrophotometer, HPLC)
IgE Analysis:
• Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits, or specific IgE
assay kits
• Plate reader compatible with the assay kit
1. PROCEDURE
BEETS (BEETROOT) Analysis:
A. Pre-analytical Preparation:
1. Thaw frozen samples in a 37°C water bath or overnight at
2-8°C before use.
2. Vortex all samples to ensure thorough mixing.
3. Centrifuge the samples at 2000-3000 g for 10 minutes to
remove particulates.
B. Analytical Procedure:
1. Follow the assay-specific steps detailed in the reagent kit insert
for sample preparation and reagent addition.
2. Incubate as per the assay requirements at specified
temperatures.
3. Measure the absorbance or resulting signal using the
appropriate analytical instrument (e.g., spectrophotometer for
chemical assays, HPLC for complex analytes).
C. Post-analytical Processing:
1. Verify results using QC data.
2. Record results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
3. Report any abnormal results immediately to the supervisor.
IgE Analysis:
A. Pre-analytical Preparation:
1. Confirm patient identifiers with requisition forms.
2. Thaw frozen samples at room temperature, ensuring thorough
mixing using a vortex mixer.
B. Analytical Procedure:
1. Dispense the required volume of standards, controls, and
patient samples into wells of a microplate.
2. Add reagents as specified in the ELISA kit protocol.
3. Incubate the plate at specified temperature and duration.
4. Wash steps as recommended in the protocol with designated
wash buffer.
5. Add the substrate solution and incubate.
6. Add stop solution after the specified incubation time.
7. Read the absorbance at the recommended wavelength using a
plate reader.
C. Post-analytical Processing:
1. Calculate results using the standard curve generated from
calibrators.
2. Verify QC results to ensure they fall within acceptable range.
3. Enter and validate all results in the LIS.
4. Flag any critical results and notify the attending supervisor.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
• Utilize control samples included with the reagent kits.
• Ensure that control results fall within the manufacturer’s specified
ranges before proceeding with patient sample analysis.
• Document and review all quality control results regularly.
• Perform instrument calibration and maintenance as per
manufacturer’s guidelines.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Ensure all results are properly recorded and reviewed in the LIS.
• Verify that all required data fields are accurately filled.
• Follow site-specific guidelines for reporting critical values,
including immediate notification protocols for critical findings.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Reference intervals for test analytes should be defined as per assay-
specific guidelines and documented in the Laboratory Information
System for reference purposes.
BEETS (BEETROOT): As per literature or clinical data, typically
determined by nature of analyte tested. IgE: Refer to the
manufacturer's guidelines or established reference ranges.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Review limitations provided in the reagent/instrument's package
inserts.
• Interpretation should consider potential interferences as per the
product insert or other validated sources.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions for each specific assay kit (e.g., ELISA
kits).
• Relevant peer-reviewed literature guiding best practices in the
analysis of BEETS (BEETROOT) specifically targeted analytes
and IgE.
