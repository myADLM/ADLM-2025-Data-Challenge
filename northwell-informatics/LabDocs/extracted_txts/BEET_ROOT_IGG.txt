Standard Operating Procedure for Analysis of BEET ROOT IGG
1. PURPOSE
To define a standardized procedure for the analytical phase of testing
Beet Root IgG. This procedure ensures the accuracy, reliability, and
reproducibility of the results and maintains compliance with CLIA
guidelines.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel performing Beet Root
IgG testing in the clinical laboratory setting.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Designated staff trained in Beet Root IgG testing are responsible
for performing the analysis and documenting the results.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring that staff adhere to this
protocol and provide ongoing training.
4. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Beet Root IgG ELISA kit
• Micropipettes and tips
• Deionized water
• Plate reader capable of reading at 450 nm
• Timer
• Laboratory notebook or digital logging system
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred: Serum sample
• Acceptable: Plasma sample (EDTA or heparin)
• Volume: Minimum 100 µL
• Stability: Store specimens at 2-8°C if testing will occur within 48
hours. For longer storage, freeze at -20°C or below.
6. PROCEDURE
6.1. Preparation
1. Reagent Preparation:
◦ Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for reconstituting and
diluting reagents and controls.
◦ Prepare washing buffer by diluting the provided concentrate
with deionized water as directed.
2. Sample Preparation:
◦ Bring all specimens and reagents to room temperature
before use.
◦ Label all tubes and wells accurately.
6.2. Assay Procedure
1. Plate Setup:
◦ Prepare the plate layout, ensuring that standards, controls,
and samples are arranged systematically.
◦ Pipette 100 µL of standards, controls, and diluted patient
samples into the assigned wells.
2. Incubation:
◦ Add 100 µL of enzyme conjugate to each well, cover the
plate with adhesive film, and incubate for 1 hour at 37°C.
3. Washing:
◦ Wash the plate 5 times using the prepared washing buffer.
Ensure complete removal of liquid after each wash cycle.
4. Substrate Reaction:
◦ Add 100 µL of the TMB substrate solution to each well.
◦ Incubate the plate in the dark for 15 minutes at room
temperature.
5. Stop Reaction:
◦ Add 100 µL of stop solution to each well to halt the
enzymatic reaction.
6. Measurement:
◦ Read the absorbance of each well at 450 nm using a plate
reader within 30 minutes of adding the stop solution.
6.3. Calculation of Results
1. Standard Curve:
◦ Plot the absorbance values of the standards on a graph to
generate a standard curve.
2. Sample Concentration:
◦ Determine the concentration of Beet Root IgG in the patient
samples by comparing their absorbance values to the
standard curve.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run controls at different levels (negative, low, and high) with each
batch of samples.
• Evaluate control results before reporting patient results. Ensure
control values fall within pre-established ranges.
• If control results are outside the acceptable range, repeat the
assay and investigate possible causes of error.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Documentation:
◦ Record the results in a laboratory notebook or enter into the
digital logging system.
◦ Include sample ID, date of analysis, operator initials, and
concentration values.
2. Verification:
◦ Have a second technologist review and verify the results
before releasing them.
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolyzed or lipemic samples may interfere with the assay.
• Cross-reactivity with other IgG antibodies should be considered.
10. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions for the Beet Root IgG ELISA kit.
• CLIA guidelines for immunological testing procedures.
11. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If assay problems are encountered (e.g., unexpected control
readings, unusual standard curve), review the procedure,
reagents, and equipment calibration. Document any deviations or
corrective actions taken.
This SOP ensures accurate and reliable determination of Beet Root
IgG levels, maintaining high standards in laboratory testing.
