Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for BENZENE AS PHENOL, OCCUPATIONAL
EXPOSURE, URINE
1. PURPOSE: This SOP outlines the procedure to accurately and
efficiently analyze urine samples for the presence of phenol as
an indicator of occupational benzene exposure.
2. RESPONSIBILITY: All qualified laboratory personnel
performing the analysis must adhere to this SOP to ensure
consistency and reliability in reported results.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND HANDLING:
◦ Specimen Type: Urine
◦ Volume Required: Minimum 10 mL of urine
◦ Collection: Collect early morning urine samples in a clean,
sterile container.
◦ Storage: Store specimens at 2-8°C if not processed
immediately. If the testing is delayed more than 24 hours,
freeze the sample at -20°C or below.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES:
◦ HPLC system with UV detector
◦ Standard solutions of phenol
◦ Methanol (HPLC grade)
◦ Water (HPLC grade)
◦ Mobile phase solvents
◦ Solid-phase extraction (SPE) columns
◦ Centrifuge
◦ Analytical balance
◦ Pipettes and tips
◦ Vials and caps
5. PROCEDURE:
Preparation:
1. Ensure all equipment is calibrated and validated
according to laboratory protocols.
2. Prepare mobile phase solvents and standard solutions of
phenol in methanol.
3. Set up the HPLC system according to manufacturer
instructions, using appropriate column and UV detection
settings for phenol analysis.
Sample Preparation: 4. Thaw frozen urine samples at room
temperature. Mix thoroughly by gentle inversion. 5. Centrifuge
urine samples at 3000 RPM for 10 minutes to remove
particulate matter. 6. Transfer the supernatant to a clean test
tube.
Extraction: 7. Condition the SPE column with 3 mL methanol
followed by 3 mL water. 8. Load 1-2 mL of the urine supernatant
onto the SPE column. 9. Wash column with 3 mL water to
remove non-polar components. 10. Elute phenol with 2 mL
methanol into a clean collection vial.
HPLC Analysis: 11. Inject an aliquot (20 µL) of the eluted
sample into the HPLC system. 12. Run the HPLC using the
established method for phenol detection. 13. Record
chromatographic data and identify phenol peaks using retention
times. 14. Quantify phenol concentration by comparing peak
areas against those of standard solutions.
6. QUALITY CONTROL: 15. Run quality control (QC) samples
(positive and negative controls) with each batch of specimens.
16. Analyze QC data to ensure accuracy and precision; accept
batch if QC results are within the specified range.
7. REPORTING RESULTS: 17. Review chromatograms and
calculations for accuracy. 18. Report results as µg of phenol/g
creatinine. 19. If results fall within or exceed allowable
occupational exposure limits, flag for immediate review by a
supervisor. 20. Communicate critical results directly to the
requesting medical professional.
8. REFERENCE INTERVALS: Negative: Below detection limit
Elevated: Above the occupational exposure threshold (typically
requires reference to specific regulatory guidelines).
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS: 21. Refer to HPLC system and
reagent manufacturer’s instructions for limitations associated
with phenol detection. 22. Note: Other phenolic compounds in
urine may interfere; ensure proper sample handling to minimize
contamination.
