Standard Operating Procedure for Benzene, Occupational
Exposure, Blood
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedures for the analysis
of benzene levels in blood samples collected from individuals with
potential occupational exposure. Accurate and consistent
identification of benzene levels in these samples is critical for
assessing exposure and ensuring workplace safety and regulatory
compliance.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to the analytical phase of testing blood
samples for benzene levels. It includes sample preparation, analytical
techniques, quality control, and result reporting.
3. RESPONSIBILITIES
• Laboratory Scientists/Technicians: Responsible for performing
sample preparation, analysis, and quality control.
• Quality Assurance Personnel: Responsible for monitoring
compliance with the SOP and reviewing quality control data.
• Supervisors/Managers: Responsible for ensuring that all
personnel are trained in this SOP and that all equipment is
properly maintained and calibrated.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred Specimen: Whole blood collected in a lavender-top
EDTA tube.
• Volume: At least 5 mL of blood.
• Stability: Specimens should be transported and stored at 2-8°C.
They should be analyzed within 48 hours of collection.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• GC-MS (Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry) or HPLC
(High-Performance Liquid Chromatography)
• Headspace autosampler (if using GC-MS)
• Benzene standard solutions
• Quality control materials (low, medium, and high benzene
concentration controls)
• EDTA tubes
• Volumetric flasks and pipettes
• Anhydrous sodium sulfate
• Glass vials with secure caps
• Methanol, dichloromethane, or other appropriate solvents
6. PROCEDURE
6.1. Sample Preparation
1. Allow blood samples to reach room temperature.
2. Vigorously mix the blood samples to ensure homogeneity.
3. Aliquot 1 mL of blood into a glass vial.
4. Add 5 mL of extraction solvent (e.g., dichloromethane).
5. Cap the vial and vortex for 5 minutes.
6. Centrifuge at 2000 rpm for 10 minutes to separate phases.
7. Pipette the organic layer (bottom layer) into a clean glass vial.
8. Dry the organic layer over anhydrous sodium sulfate.
9. Transfer the dried organic layer into a headspace vial (if using
GC-MS) or another appropriate vial for injection into the HPLC
system.
6.2. Analytical Method
6.2.1. GC-MS Procedure
1. Set up the GC-MS system according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
2. Load prepared sample vials into the headspace autosampler.
3. Use the following GC-MS conditions:
◦ Column: DB-624, 30 m x 0.32 mm i.d., 1.8 μm film thickness
◦ Carrier gas: Helium
◦ Injection volume: 1 μL (using an autosampler)
◦ Split ratio: 10:1
◦ Oven temperature program: Initial 35°C (hold 5 min), ramp
to 220°C at 15°C/min
◦ MS conditions: Electron ionization, scanning range m/z
50-200
4. Analyze samples and record retention times and mass spectra.
6.2.2. HPLC Procedure
1. Set up the HPLC system according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
2. Use the following HPLC conditions:
◦ Column: C18, 250 mm x 4.6 mm, 5 μm particle size
◦ Mobile phase: Methanol:Water (65:35)
◦ Flow rate: 1 mL/min
◦ Injection volume: 20 μL
◦ Detection wavelength: UV detection at 254 nm
3. Analyze samples and record chromatograms.
6.3. Calibration and Quality Control
1. Prepare a series of calibration standards with known benzene
concentrations (e.g., 1, 5, 10, 25, 50 μg/L) in a matrix similar to
the sample matrix.
2. Run calibration standards before analyzing samples to create a
calibration curve.
3. Include quality control samples (low, medium, high) with each
run.
4. Analyze calibration and QC sample results to ensure they fall
within acceptable limits (±10% of expected values).
7. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Calculate benzene concentrations in blood samples based on
the calibration curve.
2. Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
3. Review and verify results before releasing them.
4. Report any results exceeding occupational exposure limits
promptly to the appropriate personnel.
8. QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE
1. Perform method validation for accuracy, precision, linearity, limit
of detection, and limit of quantification before use.
2. Run QC samples with each batch of patient samples.
3. Document all QC results and corrective actions taken for out-of-
range results.
4. Review QC data periodically to ensure ongoing method
performance.
