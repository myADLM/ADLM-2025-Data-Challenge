Protocol for Analytical Phase of Generating Results for
Benzodiazepines Confirmation, Chain of Custody, Random,
Urine
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the analytical procedures for the
confirmation of benzodiazepines in urine samples collected within a
chain of custody framework for random drug testing purposes.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type:
• Urine
Collection:
• Specimens should be collected in clean, dry, and properly labeled
containers.
• The collection process must adhere to strict chain-of-custody
protocols to ensure the integrity of the sample.
Volume:
• At least 30 mL of urine is required for testing.
Stability:
• Specimens should be stored at 2-8°C and transported to the
laboratory within 24 hours of collection.
• If immediate transport is not possible, specimens can be stored
frozen at -20°C.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) or Liquid
Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes and tips
• Refrigerated storage units
• Urine collection containers
• Chain of custody forms and seals
Reagents:
• Extraction solvent (e.g., methanol, acetonitrile)
• Internal standard (e.g., deuterated benzodiazepine)
• Mobile phase solvents (e.g., water, acetonitrile, formic acid)
• Calibration standards
• Quality control samples
Supplies:
• Sample vials
• Syringes
• Gloves and other PPE
4. PROCEDURE
A) Specimen Reception and Chain of Custody Verification:
• Verify that the specimen container is properly labeled and sealed.
• Check the chain of custody documentation for completeness and
accuracy.
• Log the specimen in the laboratory information system (LIS) and
assign a unique identifier.
• Store the specimen under appropriate conditions until analysis.
B) Sample Preparation:
1. Centrifuge the urine specimen at approximately 3000 rpm for
10 minutes to remove any particulates.
2. Transfer an aliquot of the supernatant to a clean sample vial.
3. Add an appropriate volume of internal standard to the aliquot.
4. Perform liquid-liquid extraction using a suitable solvent. Mix
thoroughly and centrifuge the mixture to separate phases.
5. Transfer the organic phase to a new vial, and evaporate the
solvent under nitrogen or vacuum.
6. Reconstitute the residue in the mobile phase or other suitable
solvent.
C) Instrument Setup and Calibration:
1. Set up the GC-MS or LC-MS/MS instrument according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
2. Prepare calibration standards for target benzodiazepines and
run them to generate a calibration curve.
3. Verify instrument performance with quality control samples at
different concentration levels.
D) Analysis:
1. Inject prepared samples into the instrument.
2. Monitor for specific transitions (for LC-MS/MS) or ions (for GC-
MS) corresponding to target benzodiazepines.
3. Quantify benzodiazepines in the samples using the calibration
curve.
E) Data Analysis:
1. Review chromatograms and mass spectra for peaks
corresponding to benzodiazepines.
2. Confirm the presence of benzodiazepines by comparing
retention time and ion ratios to those of the standards.
3. Calculate concentrations using the internal standard and
calibration curve.
F) Result Interpretation and Reporting:
1. Verify and review the generated results for accuracy and
consistency.
2. Document any unusual findings or potential interferences.
3. Report the confirmed results through the LIS, ensuring
adherence to chain of custody requirements.
4. Communicate critical findings to the appropriate personnel as
per site-specific guidelines.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
Material:
• Use certified reference materials for benzodiazepines.
• Employ commercial quality control samples that span the
reportable range.
Procedure:
• Run quality control samples alongside each batch of specimens.
• Evaluate the control results against established limits.
• Perform instrument maintenance and calibration verification at
specified intervals.
6. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s manuals for GC-MS and LC-MS/MS.
• Relevant scientific literature on benzodiazepine confirmation
methods.
• Internal quality control protocols and chain of custody policies.
7. DOCUMENTATION
• All procedures and results must be documented in the LIS.
• Chain of custody documentation must be maintained and
reviewed before releasing results.
This SOP will ensure the reliable confirmation of benzodiazepines in
urine specimens while maintaining the integrity of the chain of
custody throughout the analytical phase.
