Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for
Benzodiazepines Confirmation, Random, Urine
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedures for the
identification and quantification of benzodiazepines in random urine
samples using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS).
This procedure ensures accurate and reliable results that assist in
the clinical assessment of substance use, compliance with prescribed
medications, or forensic investigations.
1. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel responsible for
performing the benzodiazepines confirmation test in the urine
samples within the clinical laboratory.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the laboratory staff to:
• Follow this protocol to ensure the accuracy and reliability of
results.
• Properly handle and prepare specimens.
• Maintain and calibrate equipment as required.
• Document all steps and any deviations in the designated logs.
• Notify the supervisor of any issues or unusual findings during the
testing process.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
◦ Preferred Specimen: 30 mL of freshly voided random
urine.
◦ Unacceptable Specimens: Urine specimens containing
preservatives, collected more than 72 hours previously
without refrigerated storage, or visibly contaminated
samples.
2. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
◦ Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) system
◦ Calibrants and internal standards for benzodiazepines
◦ Extraction solvents (e.g., methanol, acetonitrile)
◦ Reagent grade chemicals for derivatization (e.g., MSTFA)
◦ Centrifuge
◦ Eppendorf tubes
◦ Vortex mixer
◦ Pipettes and pipette tips
◦ Laboratory glassware
◦ Gloves, lab coats, and safety glasses
◦ Urine sample containers
3. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Preparation
1. Ensure all urine specimens are properly labeled and have
valid patient information.
2. Before analysis, bring refrigerated samples to room
temperature.
3. Aliquot 5 mL of urine into a clean, labeled Eppendorf tube.
B. Extraction of Benzodiazepines
1. Add 1 mL of calibrated internal standard to the aliquoted
urine sample.
2. Vortex the sample for 30 seconds to ensure thorough
mixing.
3. Add 5 mL of extraction solvent (e.g., acetonitrile) and
vortex the sample for another minute.
4. Centrifuge the mixture at 4000 rpm for 10 minutes to
separate the phases.
5. Transfer the organic layer (upper phase) to a clean glass
tube without disturbing the aqueous layer.
C. Derivatization
1. Evaporate the solvent under a stream of nitrogen gas until
dry.
2. Add 100 µL of derivatizing reagent (e.g., MSTFA) to the
dried residue.
3. Vortex the solution and incubate at 70°C for 20 minutes.
D. GC-MS Analysis
1. Set up and calibrate the GC-MS system according to the
manufacturer’s instructions using benzodiazepines
calibrators.
2. Inject 1 µL of the derivatized sample into the GC-MS.
3. Analyze the samples in accordance with the standardized
method parameters for the GC-MS system.
4. Retain the chromatography and MS data for each sample
for review.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Run positive and negative controls alongside patient
samples to ensure accuracy.
◦ Include an internal standard in every sample and control to
monitor extraction efficiency and instrument performance.
◦ Perform calibrations daily, or as needed, to match the
benzodiazepine reference standards.
◦ Document all controls, calibrations, and any deviations
observed during the process.
5. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ The results will be automatically transmitted to the
Laboratory Information System (LIS) and reviewed by the
technologist.
◦ Criteria for positive identification include retention time
matching and qualifying ion abundance ratios as specified
by the GC-MS method.
◦ Results are reported in ng/mL with respective cut-off values
and any pertinent comments.
6. REFERENCE INTERVALS
◦ Benzodiazepines are reported as positive if concentration
levels exceed the laboratory’s established cut-off values
(typically between 20-200 ng/mL depending on the specific
benzodiazepine).
7. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Cross-reactivity with structurally similar compounds may occur.
• The method requires specimens free from high concentrations of
interfering substances or preservatives.
1. SAFETY PRECAUTIONS
• Follow all laboratory safety protocols, including wearing personal
protective equipment.
• Handle chemicals and solvents in a fume hood when required.
