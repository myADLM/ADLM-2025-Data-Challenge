Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Title: Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Benzodiazepines Screen, Urine
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the analytical phase of
generating results for Benzodiazepines Screen in urine specimens,
ensuring consistency, accuracy, and compliance with CLIA-certified
laboratory standards.
Responsibility: Designated technologists are responsible for
performing the benzodiazepines screen according to this SOP. It is
the responsibility of all staff to identify any deficiencies that may affect
the results and bring them to the attention of a supervisor.
Supervisors are responsible for ensuring that the analytical
procedures are performed correctly and documented accurately.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/acceptable:
• 30 mL of freshly voided urine sent to the laboratory within 6 hours
of collection.
Unacceptable:
• Specimens arriving at the laboratory greater than 6 hours after
collection.
• Specimens without a collection date/time indicated on the sample
container or requisition. Note: If the sample has been refrigerated,
bring it to room temperature prior to analysis.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Automated drug screening instrument (e.g., Tecan Evo 200).
• Benzodiazepine reagent kits.
• Controls (positive and negative).
• Urine specimen containers.
• Disposable gloves and safety equipment.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Handling
1. Verify that specimen collection date/time is within the
acceptable range.
2. Inspect specimen for proper labeling and volume.
3. If necessary, bring specimens to room temperature before
analysis.
B. Preparation
1. Prepare the automated drug screening instrument according to
the manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Prepare controls (positive and negative) to ensure reliable test
results.
3. Load urine specimens and controls onto the instrument.
C. Instrument Calibration and Quality Control
1. Perform instrument calibration following the manufacturer’s
guidelines.
2. Run positive and negative controls prior to testing the
specimens to ensure the instrument is functioning correctly.
3. Document control results and verify they fall within acceptable
ranges. If controls fail, troubleshoot the issue and re-run
controls before proceeding with specimen analysis.
D. Analysis
1. Run the urine specimens on the automated drug screening
instrument following the instrument-specific protocol.
2. Document all steps in the job log, including the date, time,
specimen ID, and technologist’s initials.
3. Review instrument-generated results for each specimen.
E. Troubleshooting
1. If an invalid or questionable result is obtained, re-run the
specimen using fresh calibration and controls.
2. Inspect the instrument for any errors or malfunctions and
consult the manufacturer's troubleshooting guide if necessary.
3. Notify the supervisor of persistent issues and document
corrective actions taken.
4. REPORTING RESULTS
5. Verify and review the instrument-generated results to ensure
accuracy.
6. Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS) for
reporting.
7. If a result indicates potential interference or anomalies, add a
detailed comment such as “No result due to interference.”
8. Follow site-specific reporting guidelines to ensure prompt
communication of results.
9. QUALITY CONTROL
Material:
• Positive Control: Benzodiazepines control standard (Cat #
210306).
• Negative Control: Benzodiazepines-free standard (Cat # 210307).
Procedure:
1. Perform quality control testing each day or according to
laboratory policy.
2. Record control results and maintain documentation as per
laboratory guidelines.
3. If controls fall outside acceptable ranges, perform necessary
adjustments and re-test controls before analyzing specimen.
4. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Negative: No benzodiazepines detected.
• Positive: Presence of one or more benzodiazepines detected.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the respective Benzodiazepines reagent kit insert for
individual test limitations.
