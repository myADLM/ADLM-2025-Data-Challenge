Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analysis of
Benzodiazepines in Umbilical Cord Tissue
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the analysis of
benzodiazepines in umbilical cord tissue to ensure accurate and
consistent results.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of all trained laboratory personnel to follow this
SOP closely to ensure valid results. Supervisors are responsible for
reviewing and updating the procedure as necessary.
1. DEFINITION
Benzodiazepines are a class of drugs primarily used for treating
anxiety, but they are also effective in other conditions such as
insomnia, seizures, muscle spasms, and alcohol withdrawal.
Detecting these substances in the umbilical cord tissue can indicate
intrauterine exposure.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/Acceptable:
• Approximately 8 inches of umbilical cord tissue, refrigerated if not
tested immediately.
• The specimen should be collected at birth, sealed in appropriate
containers, and delivered to the laboratory promptly.
Unacceptable:
• Specimens that are dried out or decomposed.
• Specimens that have been contaminated with non-sterile
substances.
• Specimens that have been stored improperly (not refrigerated).
1. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
• Analytical balance
• Scissors or scalpel for tissue sectioning
• Clean, sterile containers for sample preparation
• Refrigerated centrifuge
• Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Vortex mixer
• Incubator
• Reagents for Benzodiazepine extraction
1. PROCEDURE
A) Specimen Preparation:
1. Record the specimen’s acceptance details, including the ID,
collection time, and any additional notes on its condition.
2. Using sterile instruments, cut 1 – 2 grams of umbilical cord
tissue from the specimen and place it in a pre-labeled, sterile
container.
3. Homogenize the tissue in 5 mL of phosphate buffer saline
(PBS) using a mechanical homogenizer until a uniform solution
is obtained.
4. Centrifuge homogenate at 4,000 rpm for 10 minutes at 4°C.
5. Transfer the supernatant to a clean conical tube.
B) Extraction of Benzodiazepines:
1. Add 2 mL of acetonitrile to the supernatant for protein
precipitation.
2. Vortex for 1 minute.
3. Centrifuge at 4,000 rpm for 10 minutes at 4°C.
4. Transfer the clear supernatant to a new tube and evaporate to
dryness under a gentle stream of nitrogen at room temperature.
C) Reconstitution:
1. Reconstitute the dried residue with 100 µL of mobile phase
(usually a mix of water, acetonitrile, and a small percentage of
formic acid).
2. Vortex briefly for 30 seconds.
3. Transfer the reconstituted solution to an LC-MS/MS vial.
D) Analysis by LC-MS/MS:
1. Set up the LC-MS/MS according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
2. Ensure that the calibration curve is freshly prepared and within
acceptable limits before sample analysis.
3. Inject 10 µL of the reconstituted sample into the LC-MS/MS.
4. Select appropriate multiple reaction monitoring (MRM)
transitions for benzodiazepines and their metabolites.
E) Quality Control:
1. Run quality control samples (both positive control with known
benzodiazepine concentration and negative control without
benzodiazepines) with each batch of samples.
2. Ensure that control samples are within established limits before
reporting any results.
3. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results are to be validated and officially signed off by a qualified
laboratory scientist.
• Negative results should be reported as “No benzodiazepines
detected.”
• Positive results should be quantitated based on the calibration
curve and reported in ng/g of tissue.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS & LIMITATIONS
• Reference intervals should be established based on clinical
research and laboratory validation data.
• Results should be interpreted within the context of clinical and
other diagnostic findings.
• Limitations include potential cross-reactivity with other
compounds and interference from decomposition products in
improperly stored specimens.
1. MAINTENANCE AND CALIBRATION
• Routine maintenance and calibration of the LC-MS/MS must be
performed as per the manufacturer’s instructions.
• Record all maintenance and calibration activities in the instrument
logbook.
1. REFERENCES
• Include references to relevant scientific literature and
manufacturer protocols used for developing this SOP.
