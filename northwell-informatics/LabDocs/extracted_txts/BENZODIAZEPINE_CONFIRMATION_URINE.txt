BENZODIAZEPINE CONFIRMATION, URINE
1. PURPOSE
This procedure is designed to detail the analytical phase required to
confirm the presence of benzodiazepines in urine samples. The
confirmation testing is targeted at detecting specific benzodiazepine
and their metabolites using Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry
(GC-MS).
2. RESPONSIBILITY
• Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the
confirmation analysis and ensuring adherence to the SOP.
• Supervisors ensure that the procedures are properly followed and
provide guidance on troubleshooting and quality control.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND MATERIALS
Equipment:
• Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS)
Reagents:
• Water: HPLC grade
• Methanol: HPLC grade
• Acetonitrile: HPLC grade
• Sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution
• Internal standard solution (e.g., Diazepam-D5)
Materials:
• Urine sample (collected, received, and accessioned)
• Calibration standards (benzodiazepine concentrations known)
• Quality Control (QC) samples (low, medium, and high
benzodiazepine levels)
• Sample vials with caps
• Pipettes and tips
• Centrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Syringe filters
• Glass wool insert (for cleanliness during extraction)
• Solid Phase Extraction (SPE) cartridges
4. DEFINITIONS
• GC-MS: Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry is an analytical
method combining gas-liquid chromatography and mass
spectrometry to identify different substances within a test sample.
5. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation of Calibration Standards and QC Samples:
1. Prepare calibration standard solutions with varying
concentrations of benzodiazepine (e.g., 10, 50, 100, 500 ng/
mL) in blank urine matrix.
2. Prepare QC samples at low, medium, and high concentrations.
3. Prepare an internal standard solution.
B. Sample Preparation:
1. Hydrolysis:
◦ Treat 2 mL of each urine sample, calibration standard, and
QC sample with NaOH to hydrolyze conjugated
benzodiazepines.
◦ Vortex mix samples and incubate at 60°C for 30 minutes.
2. Extraction:
◦ Condition SPE cartridges with 2 mL of methanol followed by
2 mL of HPLC grade water.
◦ Pass urine samples through the SPE cartridges.
◦ Wash the cartridges with 2 mL of HPLC grade water.
◦ Elute benzodiazepines with 1 mL of methanol into clean
vials.
3. Derivatization (if applicable):
◦ If derivatization is required, add derivatization reagent to the
eluate and heat for 30 minutes at 70°C.
4. Concentration:
◦ Evaporate the eluate to dryness under nitrogen gas.
◦ Reconstitute the residue with 100 µL of acetonitrile.
5. Sample Processing:
◦ Transfer reconstituted samples to autosampler vials and add
10 µL of internal standard solution to each vial.
◦ Cap vials and vortex mix.
C. GC-MS Analysis:
1. GC-MS Setup:
◦ Check and calibrate the GC-MS instrument as per
manufacturer guidelines.
◦ Set up the instrument parameters (inlet temperature, ion
source temperature, oven temperature program, etc.).
2. Injection:
◦ Inject 1 µL of the prepared samples, calibration standards,
and QC samples into the GC-MS.
◦ Use programmed parameters for separation and detection.
3. Data Acquisition:
◦ Review the chromatograms and mass spectra.
◦ Confirm the presence of benzodiazepines by comparing the
retention times and mass spectra with the calibration
standards.
D. Quality Control and Data Analysis:
1. Review QC Results:
◦ Ensure QC samples are within the acceptable ranges.
◦ If QC fails, reprocess the samples by checking sample
preparation and instrument calibration.
2. Quantitative Analysis:
◦ Calculate the concentration of benzodiazepines in the
sample based on the peak area ratio relative to the internal
standard.
◦ Ensure results are within the linear range of the calibration
curve.
E. Reporting Results:
1. Review Results:
◦ Verify all results are consistent and review flags if any.
Check the quality of chromatograms and peak integration.
◦ Print out the chromatogram and quantitative reports for the
supervisor's review.
2. Result Documentation:
◦ Document results according to laboratory protocol.
◦ Report presence/absence and concentration of
benzodiazepines in urine samples in the Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
6. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Interference: Cross-reactivity with structurally similar compounds
can occur.
• Sensitivity: Limited by the detection capability of the GC-MS and
the specificity of the chosen columns and reagents.
• Sample Quality: Poor sample handling or improper storage can
affect the test results.
