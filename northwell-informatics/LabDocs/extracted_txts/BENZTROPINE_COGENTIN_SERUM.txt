1. PURPOSE
To provide a standard protocol for the analytical phase of generating
BENZTROPINE (COGENTIN) serum results to ensure accuracy,
consistency, and reliability in testing within our CLIA-certified
laboratory.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
This procedure will be carried out by qualified and trained medical
laboratory scientists. It is the responsibility of laboratory personnel to
follow these guidelines strictly to ensure the integrity of test results.
Lab supervisors must oversee the process and ensure adherence to
the protocol's standards.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type: Serum Container: SST (Serum Separator Tube) or
red stopper tube Volume Required: Minimum 1 mL serum Stability:
• Room Temperature: Up to 8 hours
• Refrigerated (2-8°C): Up to 72 hours
• Frozen (-20°C or below): Up to 30 days
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• Centrifuge
• Vacuum blood collection tubes—SST or red stopper
• Benztropine analytical standard
• Benztropine-specific ELISA kit or equivalent HPLC equipment
• Calibrators and Control materials
• Micropipettes
• Vortex Mixer
• Analytical balance
• Reagent reservoirs
• Timer
• Laboratory-grade water
1. PROCEDURE
A) Specimen Preparation:
1. Collect blood specimen in an SST or red stopper tube following
standard venipuncture techniques.
2. Allow blood to clot for 30 minutes at room temperature.
3. Centrifuge the specimen at 3000 RPM for 10 minutes to
separate serum from clot.
4. Transfer serum into a labeled aliquot tube if not testing
immediately and store as per stability guidelines.
B) Reagent Preparation:
1. Prepare calibrators, controls, and reagents as per the
manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Ensure that all reagents and controls are brought to room
temperature prior to use.
C) Assay Procedure (if using ELISA):
1. Pipette designated volumes of calibrators, controls, and patient
serum samples into assigned wells of the microtiter plate.
2. Add enzyme conjugate to each well and mix by gently tapping
the plate.
3. Incubate for the time specified by the manufacturer, usually
between 1-2 hours at room temperature (see ELISA kit insert
for specific details).
4. Wash the wells promptly and thoroughly according to the kit
instructions to remove any unbounded substances.
5. Add substrate solution to each well and incubate in the dark for
a precise period, generally 15-30 minutes.
6. Add stop solution to each well.
7. Measure the absorbance of each well using a microplate reader
at the wavelength specified in the kit insert, typically 450 nm.
D) Assay Procedure (if using HPLC):
1. Prepare mobile phase, as specified.
2. Equilibrate the HPLC system.
3. Prepare standard curve by injecting known concentrations of
benztropine standard.
4. Inject patient serum samples and controls into the HPLC
system.
5. Measure and record the chromatograms and retention times.
Quantify the benztropine concentration by comparing the
sample peaks to the calibration curve.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
7. Prepare and run quality control samples (low, medium, and
high) with each batch of patient samples.
8. Document the quality control results. Ensure they all fall within
established control limits.
9. Troubleshoot any out-of-range controls according to standard
procedures, including equipment checks, reagent reviews, and
repeat testing.
10. REPORTING RESULTS
11. Verify all internal quality controls meet specified acceptance
criteria before releasing results.
12. Document the benztropine concentration results and calculate
based on calibrators.
13. Enter the results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
14. Critical results should be promptly reviewed and validated by a
qualified technologist and communicated to the ordering
physician.
15. REFERENCE INTERVALS
The therapeutic and toxic reference intervals for benztropine
(Cogentin) should be referenced from the latest clinical guidelines or
documented in the laboratory handbook.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
2. Hemolysis, lipemia, or icterus may interfere with the assay
results.
3. Proper specimen handling and transport conditions must be
strictly followed to avoid degradation.
4. REFERENCES
5. Manufacturer's instructions for the Benztropine ELISA Kit (or
relevant HPLC system documentation).
6. Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines.
7. Relevant scientific literature on benztropine serum analysis.
By adhering to this SOP, we aim to ensure that every step from
specimen handling to result reporting is standardized, thereby
ensuring the accuracy, precision, and reliability of benztropine
(Cogentin), serum test results in our laboratory.
