SOP for the Analytical Phase of Generating Results for BERLIN
BEETLE, IGE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE: To provide a standardized procedure for the
analysis of IgE levels specific to the Berlin Beetle allergen in
patient serum samples. This SOP ensures accurate and reliable
results are obtained and reported in a timely manner.
Responsibility:
• It is the responsibility of designated staff to conduct and oversee
the analysis of IgE levels in serum samples.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring the accuracy and
reliability of results, troubleshooting if necessary, and maintaining
documentation of the process.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS:
• Immunoassay Analyzer (specific model mentioned in the
laboratory's equipment list)
• Anti-Berlin Beetle IgE specific reagents and kits
• Calibrators and controls for IgE
• Disposable pipette tips, microplates, and other consumables
• Calibrated pipettes and multichannel pipettes
• Centrifuge
• Incubator maintained at 37°C
• Refrigerator and Freezer for sample and reagent storage
• Deionized water
• Laboratory Timer
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS:
• Preferred: 5 mL serum sample collected in a serum separator
tube (SST).
• Serum samples should be free of hemolysis, lipemia, and
turbidity.
• Samples must be received in the laboratory within 24 hours of
collection; store specimens at 2-8°C if there is a delay in testing
beyond 24 hours.
• For long-term storage, serum samples can be frozen at -20°C or
colder. Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
1. PROCEDURE:
A) Preparation
• Ensure all reagents are at room temperature before use.
• Prepare calibrators, controls, and patient samples according to
the kit manufacturer’s instructions.
• Label microplate wells appropriately.
B) Calibration and Quality Control
• Perform a calibration curve using provided calibrators, ensuring to
follow the manufacturer’s guidelines.
• Run quality control samples (both low and high IgE controls) at
the beginning and end of each assay run to ensure the accuracy
and precision of the test system.
• Record QC results and ensure they fall within acceptable ranges.
If QC fails, do not proceed with the patient samples until the issue
is resolved.
C) Sample Analysis
1. Thaw frozen serum samples if applicable and mix gently.
Centrifuge samples if necessary to remove particulate matter.
2. Pipette recommended volumes of calibrators, controls, and
patient samples into the corresponding wells as per the kit’s
instruction.
3. Add the specified IgE detection reagents to each well.
4. Incubate the microplate at 37°C for the required duration as per
the assay protocol.
5. Wash the microplate wells thoroughly to remove unbound
reagents, following the wash steps outlined in the kit.
6. Add substrate solution to each well. Incubate at room
temperature or as directed by the kit’s instructions.
7. Add stop solution to each well to terminate the reaction.
8. Measure the optical density (OD) of each well using a
microplate reader at the specified wavelength.
D) Data Analysis
• Plot the calibration curve using the OD values against the
concentration of calibrators.
• Calculate the IgE concentrations of patient samples using the
calibration curve.
• Ensure that sample results are within the dynamic range of the
assay. Dilute and re-assay samples that exceed the highest
calibrator value.
1. REPORTING RESULTS:
• Results should be entered into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
• Verify results to ensure they meet the quality control criteria
before release.
• Abnormal results or results that exceed the laboratory's
predetermined critical values should be reviewed by a supervisor
and, if necessary, communicated to the requesting physician
immediately.
1. QUALITY CONTROL AND MAINTENANCE:
• Ensure routine maintenance and calibration of analytical
instruments as per manufacturer guidelines.
• Document any maintenance and corrective actions taken.
• Store all reagents and samples at specified temperatures to
maintain their integrity.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
• Hemolysis, lipemia, and icterus in samples may interfere with IgE
detection.
• Cross-reactivity with other allergens, if specified, can yield
inaccurate results.
