Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase Protocol for Bermuda Grass IgE, Serum
Testing
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to provide standardized procedures for
the analytical phase of generating results for Bermuda Grass IgE,
Serum testing, ensuring precise, reliable, and timely laboratory test
results.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing Bermuda
Grass IgE, Serum testing following this procedure.
It is the responsibility of all staff to identify any deficiencies which may
affect test results, ensuring proper corrective action is taken
immediately.
1. DEFINITION
Bermuda Grass IgE: Immunoglobulin E specific to Bermuda Grass,
indicating allergic sensitization in patients.
1. PROCEDURE
Specimen Requirements and Stability:
• Specimen Type: Serum.
• Collection Procedure: Blood should be collected in standard
serum separators or red-top tubes.
• Specimen Volume: Minimum of 2 mL of serum.
• Storage: Serum can be stored at 2-8°C for up to 7 days. For
longer storage, serum should be frozen at -20°C or below.
• Unacceptable Specimens: Specimens with hemolysis, lipemia, or
incorrect labeling should be rejected.
Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies:
• Analyzer: Commercial Immunoassay analyzer (e.g., Phadia,
Immulite).
• Reagents: Commercially available Bermuda Grass IgE kit.
• Controls: Two levels of IgE controls (low and high).
• Ancillary Equipment: Centrifuge, pipettes, vortex mixer,
refrigerator/freezer.
Quality Control:
• Perform quality control checks using IgE control materials before
running patient samples.
• Ensure controls fall within acceptable ranges. If controls are out,
do not proceed with patient testing until resolved.
Testing Procedure:
1. Prepare the immunoassay analyzer as per manufacturer’s
guidelines.
2. Check reagent expiration dates and thaw frozen reagents if
necessary.
3. Calibrate the analyzer using appropriate calibration standards.
4. Perform quality control checks and ensure they fall within
acceptable ranges before running patient samples.
5. Set up the patient samples, ensuring proper sample
identification.
6. Place the specimen and reagents on the analyzer and initiate
the testing following manufacturer instructions.
7. Document the procedure, including calibration verification,
control results, date, time, and initials of the person performing
the test.
Reporting Results:
1. Review results generated by the analyzer in accordance with
laboratory reporting guidelines.
2. Verify results based on the laboratory's verification criteria.
3. Report results to the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
ensuring that critical values are communicated immediately to
the physician.
4. Document any issues encountered during testing and the
corrective action taken.
Reference Intervals:
• Reference intervals are determined from population studies and
provided by the kit manufacturer.
• Typical ranges for Bermuda Grass IgE: 0–0.35 kU/L (negative), >
0.35 kU/L (positive).
Method Limitations:
• Specimen must be free of gross hemolysis, lipemia or
contamination.
• Ensure samples meet the volume requirements for accurate
measurements.
• Refer to the manufacturer's kit insert for detailed limitations.
References:
• Manufacturer’s insert for Bermuda Grass IgE assay kit.
• Laboratory internal quality control documentation.
Review and Revision:
• This SOP should be reviewed annually and revised as necessary
to reflect changes in laboratory practices or manufacturer
updates.
Approval:
• Approved by: [Laboratory Director’s Name]
