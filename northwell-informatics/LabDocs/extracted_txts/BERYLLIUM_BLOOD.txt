Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Beryllium in
Blood Analysis
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for the accurate and reliable analysis of
beryllium concentration in blood samples to support clinical diagnosis
and monitoring of occupational exposure to beryllium.
Responsibility:
Laboratory personnel are responsible for performing the analysis and
ensuring the accuracy and precision of results. Supervisors are
responsible for ensuring these procedures are followed and for
addressing any issues that may arise during the process.
1. SCOPE
This procedure applies to the quantification of beryllium in blood
specimens collected from patients for the purpose of beryllium
exposure assessment.
1. PRINCIPLE
Beryllium concentration in blood is analyzed using Inductively
Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS), which provides
sensitive and accurate measurements of trace elements in biological
specimens.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
◦ Specimen Type: Whole blood
◦ Collection Containers: Trace element-free BD Vacutainer®
(royal blue-top) tube with EDTA
◦ Volume: Minimum of 3 mL blood
◦ Stability:
▪ Room Temperature: 24 hours
▪ Refrigerated (2-8°C): 5 days
▪ Frozen (-20°C): 1 month
Unacceptable Specimens:
- Hemolyzed, clotted, or improperly collected samples
- Specimens received in heparin or other non-EDTA tubes
- Inadequate volume
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
◦ ICP-MS instrument
◦ Calibration standards for beryllium
◦ Quality control materials
◦ Nitric acid (trace metal grade)
◦ Deionized water (ultra-purified)
◦ Serological pipettes
◦ Digestion vessels
2. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation of Reagents:
- Prepare calibration standards and quality control materials according to manufacturer's guidelines.
- Dilute nitric acid to a 2% (v/v) working solution.
B. Sample Preparation:
- Gently invert blood collection tubes to mix the sample without causing hemolysis.
- Aliquot 1 mL of whole blood into digestion vessels.
- Add 2 mL of 2% nitric acid to each aliquot.
- Cap and place digestion vessels in a microwave digestion system.
- Digest samples using the microwave digestion protocol: temperature ramp to 180°C over 10 minutes, hold at 180°C for 20 minutes, and then cool down.
- Transfer digestates to clean tubes and dilute with deionized water to a final volume of 10 mL.
C. Instrument Calibration:
- Calibrate the ICP-MS with at least five beryllium standards covering the expected range of the specimens.
- Perform a blank calibration run before analyzing specimens to ensure no contamination.
D. Sample Analysis:
- Set the ICP-MS operating conditions and parameters as per the instrument manual.
- Analyze calibration standards and quality control samples at the beginning of the run, after every 10 patient samples, and at the end of the run.
- Aspirate each prepared blood sample into the ICP-MS.
- Record the results and review quality control data to validate the run.
E. Quality Control:
- Accept results if quality control samples are within the defined limits.
- Investigate and resolve any quality control failures before reporting patient results.
3. REPORTING RESULTS:
- Review the analytical data and ensure accuracy.
- Report the concentration of beryllium in blood in units of μg/L (micrograms per liter).
- Transmit results to the Laboratory Information System (LIS) for entry without manual editing.
- Verify results in LIS before releasing; if discrepancies are found, reanalyze the sample.
4. REFERENCE INTERVALS:
- Normal beryllium level: Less than 0.2 μg/L
- Levels above 0.2 μg/L may indicate beryllium exposure and should be further investigated in clinical context.
5. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
- Ensure specimens are free from significant hemolysis or contamination, as this can affect results.
- Beryllium concentration can be affected by the patient’s hydration status and collection technique.
6. DOCUMENTATION AND REVIEW:
◦ All records of instrument calibration, quality control, and
sample analysis should be maintained in accordance with
laboratory policy.
◦ This SOP should be reviewed annually or as needed to
ensure compliance with updated best practices, regulations,
and technological advancements.
