Protocol for the Generation of BETA-2-MICROGLOBULIN
Results
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this protocol is to provide a standard procedure for
the analytical phase of generating results for BETA-2-
MICROGLOBULIN in the medical laboratory. This ensures precision,
accuracy, and consistency in test results, aligning with CLIA
certification standards.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all staff trained in the analytical process
involving Beta-2-Microglobulin testing using the specified equipment
and reagents.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
All designated laboratory staff members trained in Beta-2-
Microglobulin assay procedures are responsible for performing tests
and generating results according to this protocol. Supervisors are
responsible for ensuring adherence to this SOP and for implementing
corrective actions if deviations occur.
4. DEFINITION
Beta-2-Microglobulin (β2M) is a low molecular weight protein that is a
component of the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class I
molecules, shed by cells into the blood, and is widely used as a
tumor marker, and in evaluations of renal function and immune
status.
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type: - Blood plasma or serum - Blood should be collected
in a red-top, SST, or heparin (green-top) tube. - Urine - A random or a
24-hour urine collection.
Specimen Volume: - Serum/plasma: minimum 1 mL - Urine: minimum
10 mL
6. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Primary Equipment: - Immunoassay Analyzer (e.g., Siemens ADVIA
Centaur XP, Abbott Architect) - Refrigerated Centrifuge - Pipettes
(calibrated) - Traceable Temperature Monitors
Reagents: - Beta-2-Microglobulin Assay Kit (e.g., from Siemens,
Roche, or Abbott) - Quality Control (QC) materials - Calibrators -
Deionized Water
Supplies: - Sample tubes/vials - Gloves, lab coats, and appropriate
PPE - Timer
7. PROCEDURE
1. Preparation: a. Ensure all equipment (centrifuge,
immunoassay analyzers) is powered on, calibrated, and verified
to be within acceptable performance thresholds. b. Retrieve the
Beta-2-Microglobulin Assay Kit and ensure it is within the
expiration date. Bring reagents to room temperature if required
by the manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Sample Processing: a. Blood Samples: i. Centrifuge the blood
sample at 1500g for 10 minutes to obtain clear plasma/serum.
ii. Transfer the supernatant to a labeled sample tube. b. Urine
Samples: i. Mix the urine sample well before aliquoting.
3. Assay Procedure: a. Set up the immunoassay analyzer
according to the manufacturer’s guidelines. b. Load the assay
reagents, calibrators, and quality control materials as per the kit
insert instructions. c. Pipette the required volume of patient
sample, calibrators, and control material into the designated
wells or sample cups on the analyzer. d. Initiate the assay run
and ensure the analyzer follows the programmed
methodological steps for Beta-2-Microglobulin measurement.
4. Calibration and Quality Control: a. Run the calibrators to
create a standard curve. b. Analyze QC samples at multiple
levels (e.g., low, medium, high) before running patient samples.
c. Verify that QC results are within the acceptable range. If QC
results are not within range, troubleshoot and rerun until
acceptable results are achieved.
5. Sample Analysis: a. Load patient samples onto the analyzer
following QC validation. b. Upon completion of the assay run,
review results on the analyzer’s software for any flagged results
needing further assessment. c. Repeat analysis if the
instrument indicates potential issues or if the results fall outside
the expected ranges.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Verify and approve patient results within the Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
• Consistently document and report results according to established
clinical reporting guidelines.
• For results falling outside the reference range, take appropriate
follow-up actions in line with laboratory protocols.
9. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Reference intervals may vary by method and population. Specific
reference intervals should be obtained from the assay kit insert:
e.g., Serum: - 0.8-2.5 mg/L
10. QUALITY CONTROL AND CALIBRATION
• Follow manufacturer's guidelines for QC and calibration
frequency.
• Use two levels of control materials (low and high) for daily
monitoring.
• Document all QC data and maintain QC logs for compliance.
11. TROUBLESHOOTING
• In the event of equipment failure, consult the equipment manual
and technical support.
• Document any deviations or failures and the steps taken for
resolution.
• Refer unresolved issues to the laboratory supervisor.
12. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples may interfere with the
assay results.
• Ensure specimens are handled and stored correctly to avoid
degradation.
13. SAFETY
• Follow all laboratory safety protocols, including the use of PPE.
• Dispose of biohazardous waste in compliance with safety
guidelines.
