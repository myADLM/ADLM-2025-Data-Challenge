Standard Operating Procedure for BETA-2-Microglobulin
(BETA-2-M), Spinal Fluid Analysis
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to detail the procedure for the analysis of
BETA-2-Microglobulin (BETA-2-M) in spinal fluid, ensuring accurate
and reliable results.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all staff performing the analysis of BETA-2-M in
spinal fluid within the laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
All designated laboratory personnel are responsible for adhering to
this SOP. The laboratory supervisor is responsible for verifying and
ensuring the compliance of this SOP.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Spinal fluid (Cerebrospinal Fluid, CSF)
• Collection Requirements: CSF collected in a sterile, leak-proof
container.
• Specimen Volume: Minimum volume of 0.5 mL is required.
• Specimen Stability: Store at 2-8°C if analysis will be performed
within 48 hours. For longer storage, freeze at -20°C or lower.
Avoid frequent freeze-thaw cycles.
5. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes and tips
• Test tubes and racks
• Beta-2-Microglobulin reagent kit
• Calibrators and controls specific for BETA-2-M analysis
• Automated immunoassay analyzer or appropriate manual assay
setup
• Laboratory timer
• PPE (Personal Protective Equipment)
6. REAGENTS AND CONSUMABLES
• Beta-2-Microglobulin reagent kit (store as per manufacturer's
recommendation).
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Internal quality controls at low, medium, and high concentrations
must be run at the beginning of each shift, after every calibration,
following major maintenance, and when troubleshooting issues.
• External quality controls should be run and documented
according to the laboratory's quality assurance plan.
8. CALIBRATION
• Calibrate the instrument as per the manufacturer’s instructions,
usually once per day or as specified by the reagent kit
manufacturer.
• Use fresh calibrators and prepare them according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
9. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Processing:
1. Ensure the CSF specimen is at the required temperature. If
frozen, thaw at room temperature and mix gently before
analysis.
2. Centrifuge the CSF specimen at 1500-2000 g for 10 minutes to
remove any particulate matter. Carefully transfer the
supernatant to a new, labeled test tube.
B. Instrument Setup (for automated analysis):
1. Power on the analyzer and allow it to perform self-checks.
2. Ensure all reagents, calibrators, and controls are loaded
properly.
3. Program the analyzer for BETA-2-M assay following the
manufacturer's instructions.
C. Manual Assay Setup (if applicable):
1. Follow the manufacturer's instructions found in the Beta-2-
Microglobulin reagent kit for manual setup.
2. Pipette the appropriate volumes of specimen, calibrators, and
controls into designated wells or tubes.
3. Incubate, wash, and add detection reagents as prescribed.
D. Analysis:
1. Load the prepared specimens, calibrators, and controls onto
the analyzer.
2. Start the assay run according to the setup protocol.
3. For manual assays, follow the timing and steps provided by the
reagent kit manufacturer for incubation, washing, and
developing the reaction.
E. Result Interpretation:
1. Once the analysis is complete, review the generated data.
2. Verify that the quality control results are within acceptable
ranges. If controls fail, troubleshoot and repeat the analysis.
3. Report patient results only if controls are within established
ranges.
10. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results will be automatically transmitted to the Laboratory
Information System (LIS) and must be reviewed and verified by
the technologist before final reporting.
• Record results in the appropriate laboratory log and follow site-
specific reporting guidelines.
11. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Reference intervals should be established based on the assay
method and population. Refer to the reagent manufacturer’s insert
for specific reference ranges.
12. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolysis, lipemia, and icterus can interfere with the assay and
should be avoided.
• Refer to the Beta-2-Microglobulin reagent kit insert for specific
limitations related to the individual reagent pads.
13. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s Beta-2-Microglobulin reagent kit product insert.
• Internal laboratory quality control policies and procedures.
• Relevant scientific literature on BETA-2-Microglobulin in spinal
fluid analysis.
14. DOCUMENTATION
• Keep records of all calibrations, quality controls, patient results,
and maintenance logs as per laboratory policies.
• Document any deviations from the SOP and the corrective actions
taken.
This completes the SOP for the analytical phase of generating results
for BETA-2-Microglobulin in spinal fluid. Ensure adherence to this
protocol to maintain consistency and accuracy in laboratory testing.
