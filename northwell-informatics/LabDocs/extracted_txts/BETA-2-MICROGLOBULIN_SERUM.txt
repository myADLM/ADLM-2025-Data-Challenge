Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Measurement of
Beta-2-Microglobulin (B2M) in Serum
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the procedure for the measurement of Beta-2-
Microglobulin (B2M) in serum samples. Beta-2-Microglobulin is a
protein found on the surface of most cells and is shed by cells into
the blood. The measurement of B2M serves as a marker for
evaluating renal function and certain malignancies like lymphoma
and leukemia.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing this
procedure according to the guidelines set out in this document. It is
the responsibility of the laboratory personnel to ensure that all
equipment is calibrated, quality controls are within acceptable limits,
and results are accurately reported. Any potential deviations or
issues encountered must be reported to a supervisor promptly.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Preferred Specimen:
• Serum collected in a standard red-top collection tube.
Specimen Handling:
• Collect 5 mL of blood.
• Allow the blood to clot by leaving it undisturbed at room
temperature for 15-30 minutes.
• Centrifuge the specimen at 1,300–2,000g for 10–15 minutes.
• Separate the serum from the clot and transfer to a clean, labeled
tube.
Specimen Stability:
• Serum specimens can be stored at 2-8°C for up to 7 days.
• For long-term storage, samples should be frozen at -20°C or
lower.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
• Incorrectly labeled or mishandled specimens.
• Specimens collected in anticoagulant tubes (e.g., EDTA, heparin).
1. REAGENTS, EQUIPMENT, AND SUPPLIES
Reagents:
• B2M assay reagent kit (as per manufacturer’s instructions)
• Calibrators and controls (as per manufacturer’s instructions)
Equipment:
• Centrifuge
• Automated immunoassay analyzer
Supplies:
• Standard serological pipettes and tips
• Clean lab coats and disposable gloves
• Serum sample tubes and vials
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation:
1. Confirm that the immunoassay analyzer has been calibrated
according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
2. Prepare the reagents, calibrators, and controls as per the
manufacturer’s instructions.
3. Ensure all equipment is clean and in proper working condition.
B. Assay Procedure:
1. Allow serum samples, calibrators, and controls to reach room
temperature before testing.
2. Pipette the appropriate volume of the patient’s serum,
calibrators, and controls into labeled sample cups or directly
into the analyzer as specified by the manufacturer.
3. Load the reagents, samples, calibrators, and controls into the
automated immunoassay analyzer following the instrument’s
loading procedure.
4. Start the analysis run on the analyzer according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
C. Analyzing and Generating Results:
1. The analyzer will automatically process the samples, perform
the necessary calculations, and generate the results.
2. Once the run is complete, verify that the quality control results
are within acceptable ranges.
3. If QC results are acceptable, review and validate patient
results.
4. If QC results are not acceptable, troubleshoot according to the
analyzer’s troubleshooting guide, recalibrate, and repeat the
run.
5. REPORTING RESULTS
• Transmit results from the analyzer to the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
• Verify and review results for accuracy and compliance with
acceptable ranges.
• Report critical values immediately to the appropriate clinician or
department, following established protocols for critical value
reporting.
• Document results in the patient’s medical record and inform the
clinician of any relevant findings.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• The normal reference range for B2M varies by method and
instrument. Consult the manufacturer’s instructions and clinical
guidelines for specific reference values used in your laboratory.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Follow the manufacturer’s guidelines for quality control material
preparation, storage, and handling.
• Run quality controls with each batch of patient testing or as
recommended by the manufacturer.
• Document all QC results and take corrective actions if QC results
fall outside acceptable ranges.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to the B2M assay reagent kit insert for detailed information
on the limitations of the assay.
• Interfering substances or conditions like hemolysis, lipemia, or
icterus may affect the accuracy of the results.

• Manufacturer’s package insert and guidelines for the B2M assay
reagent kit.
