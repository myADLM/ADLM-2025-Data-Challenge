Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for BETA-2 GLYCOPROTEIN 1 ANTIBODIES,
IgA, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the analysis of Beta-2
Glycoprotein 1 (β2GP1) antibodies, IgA in serum samples. The
procedure ensures accurate, reliable, and reproducible test results,
thereby supporting diagnostic and clinical decision-making
processes.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of trained laboratory personnel to perform,
document, and validate the results of this analysis according to the
following procedures. Laboratory supervisors are responsible for
ensuring compliance and for addressing any issues related to the
procedure.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred Specimen: Serum sample
• Collection: Blood must be collected by venipuncture into a plain
red-top or serum-separator tube (SST).
• Handling: Allow the blood to clot at room temperature for 30
minutes, then centrifuge the sample within 1 hour of collection.
• Volume: Minimum required volume 0.5 mL serum
• Stability: The separated serum may be stored at 2-8°C for up to 7
days or frozen at -20°C or lower for longer storage.
• Unacceptable Specimen: Hemolyzed or lipemic samples, or those
containing particulate matter.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• ELISA (Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay) reader
• Microplate washer
• Incubator set at 37°C
• Pipettes and tips (calibrated)
• β2GP1 IgA Antibodies ELISA kit (which includes microplates
coated with β2GP1 antigen, conjugate, substrate solution, stop
solution, and wash buffer)
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Positive Control: Serum with known level of β2GP1 IgA antibodies
• Negative Control: β2GP1 antibodies negative serum
• Run controls with each batch of patient samples to ensure the
assay is working as expected.
• If controls are out of range, do not report patient results. Identify
and correct the issue before re-running the controls and patient
samples.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation:
1. Ensure all reagents and samples are at room temperature
before starting the assay.
2. Label the ELISA plate appropriately, dedicating wells for
controls, calibrators, and patient samples.
B. Assay Procedure:
1. Add 100 μL of standards, controls, and patient serum samples
to the wells.
2. Incubate the plate at 37°C for 60 minutes.
3. Aspirate the contents of the wells and wash the plate 3 times
with the prepared wash buffer using a microplate washer.
4. Add 100 μL of conjugate to each well.
5. Incubate the plate at 37°C for 30 minutes.
6. Repeat the wash step.
7. Add 100 μL of substrate solution to each well.
8. Incubate the plate at room temperature, protected from light for
10-15 minutes.
9. Add 100 μL of stop solution to each well.
C. Reading and Calculation:
1. Read the absorbance at 450 nm using the ELISA reader within
15 minutes of adding the stop solution.
2. Use the software associated with the ELISA reader to generate
a standard curve from the standards and calculate the
concentration of β2GP1 IgA antibodies in patient samples.
3. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
• Results are reported in units (U/mL) based on the standard curve.
• Interpretation of results should adhere to the reference values
provided by the kit manufacturer or laboratory-specific validated
ranges.
• Typically, <20 U/mL is considered negative, 20-40 U/mL is
considered borderline, and >40 U/mL is considered positive.
These ranges may vary.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Verify results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS) before
releasing.
• Flag any unexpected or critical values and notify the attending
clinician as per laboratory policy.
• Document any quality control issues and steps taken to resolve
them before reporting patient results.
1. LIMITATIONS
• Assay results should be used in conjunction with other clinical
findings.
• Interference from hemolytic, lipemic, or icteric samples cannot be
ruled out.
1. REFERENCES
• Kit manufacturer’s instructions.
• Laboratory Quality Control guidelines.
1. DOCUMENTATION
• Record all assay details, including reagent lot numbers, sample
IDs, and results, in the appropriate documentation log.
• Maintain documentation for regulatory compliance and quality
assurance audits.
This protocol provides a comprehensive guideline for the analysis of
β2GP1 antibodies, IgA in serum, ensuring accuracy and reliability in
test results. Always follow manufacturer guidelines and internal
laboratory validation procedures.
