Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Beta-2 Glycoprotein 1 Antibodies, IgG and IgM, Serum
1. PURPOSE
This protocol outlines the analytical procedures for generating results
for Beta-2 Glycoprotein 1 Antibodies, IgG and IgM, in serum
specimens. The aim is to ensure accurate and reliable results to
support clinical diagnosis and management of autoimmune
conditions such as antiphospholipid syndrome (APS).
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing the
analysis, troubleshooting, and documentation as per this SOP. All
staff must be vigilant in identifying any issues that may affect the test
results and report them to the supervisor promptly.
1. DEFINITION
Beta-2 Glycoprotein 1 Antibodies are autoimmune antibodies
associated with APS. This SOP includes procedures for measuring
IgG and IgM isotypes.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Preferred Specimen:
• Serum specimen collected in a red-top tube or SST (serum
separator tube).
• Minimum volume: 1 mL serum.
Stability:
• Unprocessed sample: Stable at room temperature (20-25°C) for
up to 8 hours.
• Processed serum: Stable refrigerated at 2-8°C for up to 48 hours.
• Frozen: Aliquots of serum can be frozen at -20°C or lower for up
to 6 months.
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
• Specimens with incorrect labeling (missing patient identification,
date, time).
• Samples collected in anticoagulant tubes such as EDTA, heparin,
or citrate.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• ELISA plate reader
• Microplate washer
• Incubator at 37°C
• Pipettes (automated or manual) with disposable tips
Reagents:
• ELISA kit for Beta-2 Glycoprotein 1 Antibodies (IgG and IgM)
• Wash buffer
• Substrate solution
• Stopping solution
Supplies:
• Pipette tips
• Microplate strips
• Parafilm
1. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
• Ensure all reagents and samples are at room temperature before
starting.
• Calibrate pipettes if necessary.
Assay Procedure:
1. Sample Dilution:
◦ Dilute serum samples 1:100 in supplied sample diluent (as
per kit instructions).
2. Plate Preparation:
◦ Add 100 µL of diluted samples, calibrators, and controls into
appropriate wells. Each sample should be run in duplicate.
◦ Cover plate with parafilm and incubate at 37°C for 1 hour.
3. Washing:
◦ Wash plate 4 times with wash buffer using microplate
washer.
4. Detection Antibody:
◦ Add 100 µL of detection antibody to each well.
◦ Incubate at room temperature for 30 minutes.
5. Substrate Addition:
◦ Add 100 µL of substrate solution to each well.
◦ Incubate at room temperature in the dark for 10-15 minutes.
6. Stopping Reaction:
◦ Add 100 µL of stopping solution to each well to stop the
enzymatic reaction.
7. Reading Plate:
◦ Read absorbance at appropriate wavelength as defined in
the kit insert (usually 450 nm) using ELISA plate reader.
Quality Control:
• Run internal controls with each batch of tests to ensure
consistency.
• Document results of controls in QC log.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
Calculation:
• Calculate antibody concentration using standard curve generated
from calibrators.
• If the assay results are outside the calibration range, the sample
should be re-assayed at an appropriate dilution.
Reference Intervals:
• IgG: < 20 GPL units (Negative); 20-80 GPL units (Low positive); >
80 GPL units (High positive)
• IgM: < 20 MPL units (Negative); 20-80 MPL units (Low positive); >
80 MPL units (High positive)
Documentation:
• Record all test results in the appropriate format.
• Provide a final report including antibody concentration and
interpretation according to established reference intervals.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Potential interference by hemolysis, lipemia, or icterus in samples.
• False positives/negatives may occur; thorough sample and
control handling is necessary to minimize errors.
