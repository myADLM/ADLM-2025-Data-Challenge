Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) for BETA-2
GLYCOPROTEIN 1 ANTIBODIES, IGG, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
To provide standardized procedures for the analysis of Beta-2
Glycoprotein 1 Antibodies—IgG in serum to ensure accurate and
reliable results.
2. DEFINITIONS
Beta-2 Glycoprotein 1 Antibodies—IgG: Antibodies against Beta-2
Glycoprotein 1, significant in the diagnosis of antiphospholipid
syndrome (APS).
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen:
• Preferred: Serum (collected in a red-top tube or serum separator
tube).
• Volume: Minimum of 1 mL serum.
Handling and Stability:
• Serum should be separated from cells within 2 hours of collection.
• Store serum refrigerated at 2-8°C if analysis is to be done within
48 hours. For longer storage, freeze at -20°C or lower.
Unacceptable Conditions:
• Grossly hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric specimens.
• Specimens received beyond stability limits without proper
documentation.
4. PROCEDURE
Equipment and Reagents:
• Automated Immunoassay Analyzer.
• Beta-2 Glycoprotein 1 Antibodies IgG reagent kit (approved for
analyzer used).
• Calibrators and controls.
• Pipettes, microcentrifuge tubes, and standard laboratory supplies.
Preparation:
• Ensure all reagents are within expiration date and properly
prepared.
• Calibrate the analyzer as per the manufacturer's instructions
before running patient samples.
• Run quality control materials to ensure analyzer performance is
within limits.
Steps:
1. Sample Preparation:
◦ Thaw frozen specimens at room temperature if applicable
and mix gently by inversion.
◦ Centrifuge if there is any particulate matter present (10
minutes at 1,500 x g).
2. Instrument Setup:
◦ Turn on the immunoassay analyzer and perform any
necessary startup checks.
◦ Load the Beta-2 Glycoprotein 1 Antibodies IgG reagent kit,
calibrators, and controls.
3. Calibration:
◦ Calibrate the instrument using the calibration material
provided in the reagent kit.
◦ Follow the instrument's guidelines for the calibration
frequency.
4. Quality Control:
◦ Run control samples at the beginning of each batch, after
every calibration, and at the end of the run.
◦ Accept the run if quality control samples are within the
expected ranges.
5. Sample Testing:
◦ Aliquot 250 µL of serum sample into the appropriate sample
cup or tube.
◦ Place the samples on the analyzer rack.
◦ Initiate the test run according to the analyzer's operating
procedures.
6. Result Analysis:
◦ Once the run is complete, review the results generated by
the analyzer.
◦ Verify that the instrument flags or quality control indicates no
issues during the run.
◦ Confirm that internal and external controls meet acceptable
limits before reporting patient results.
5. REPORTING RESULTS
Reference Interval:
• Results are typically reported in Standard Units (e.g., U/mL).
• Negative: Less than 20 U/mL
• Indeterminate: 20 - 40 U/mL
• Positive: Greater than 40 U/mL
Result Documentation:
• Ensure the results are reviewed and verified by the technologist.
• Immediately address any flagged or unusual results with
additional verification, retesting, or by referring to a supervisor.
• Report results through the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
6. QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE
• Perform calibration annually or when significant issues arises.
• Maintain logs of all calibration, maintenance, and corrective
actions taken for equipment.
• Participation in proficiency testing programs is required.
7. PROCEDURE FOR HANDLING ERRORS
• If an error is detected (e.g., out-of-range control, instrument
failure), halt the testing process immediately.
• Perform necessary troubleshooting and document any corrective
action taken.
• Repeat testing of affected samples once the issue has been
resolved and controls are back within acceptable range.
