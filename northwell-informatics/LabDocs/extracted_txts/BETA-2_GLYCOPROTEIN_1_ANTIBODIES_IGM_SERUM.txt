STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP)
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to provide guidelines for the
measurement and reporting of Beta-2 Glycoprotein 1 (β2GP1)
Antibodies, IgM in serum. This assay is used primarily in the
diagnosis of autoimmune diseases, including Antiphospholipid
Syndrome (APS).
Responsibility:
• It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory personnel to
perform the assay according to the outlined procedures,
document results accurately, and carry out required quality control
measures.
• It is the responsibility of laboratory supervisors to ensure all staff
are trained in this protocol and adhere to it.
1. SPECIMEN
Acceptable:
• Serum collected in a red-top or serum separator tube (SST). The
specimen must be separated from cells within 2 hours of
collection to avoid hemolysis.
Unacceptable:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric specimens, as these can interfere
with the assay.
• Specimens other than serum, such as plasma or whole blood.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• ELISA reader (Microplate Reader)
• Pipettes and tips
• Microplate washer
• Reagent kit for β2GP1 Antibodies IgM (follow manufacturer
instructions)
• Standard laboratory glassware and plasticware
• Calibrators and controls (Positive and Negative Controls)
• Timer
1. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation:
• Bring all reagents, samples, and controls to room temperature
before use.
• Prepare reagents and calibrators according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
• Ensure the ELISA reader and microplate washer are ready for
operation and have been calibrated/maintained appropriately.
B) Assay Procedure:
1. Label wells for standards, controls, and patient specimens.
2. Add 100 μL of standard, control, and specimens to the
appropriate wells. Ensure no bubbles are present.
3. Incubate for 30 minutes at 37°C.
4. Wash wells 4 times with wash buffer. Ensure complete removal
of liquid from wells each time.
5. Add 100 μL of enzyme-conjugate to each well.
6. Incubate for 30 minutes at 37°C.
7. Wash wells 4 times with wash buffer.
8. Add 100 μL of substrate solution to each well.
9. Incubate for 15 minutes at 37°C in the dark.
10. Add 50 μL of stop solution to each well.
11. Measure the absorbance at 450 nm using an ELISA reader
within 30 minutes of adding the stop solution.
C) Calculation:
• Construct a standard curve by plotting the absorbance of
standards against their concentrations.
• Determine patient specimen concentrations from the standard
curve.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results should be interpreted within the context of clinical findings
and other laboratory data.
• Report results in U/mL.
• Reference Range: IgM Negative: <20 U/mL, Borderline: 20-30 U/
mL, Positive: >30 U/mL
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run positive and negative controls with each assay.
• Check that control values fall within the specified range provided
by the reagent kit. If controls do not fall within the range: a.
Recalibrate equipment and repeat controls. b. If repetition
includes controls within range, proceed with running patient
samples. c. If controls are still outside the range, contact the
supervisor for further instructions.
1. LIMITATIONS
• Antibodies to β2GP1 are found in several autoimmune diseases;
interprete results in context with clinical information.
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or bacterial contamination samples may lead
to erroneous results.
• Values obtained should be used in conjunction with other
diagnostic results to determine patient status.
1. SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS
• Use proper personal protective equipment (PPE) throughout the
procedure.
• Handle all biological samples as if they are potentially infectious.
• Dispose of spent samples and contaminated wastes according to
biosafety guidelines.
