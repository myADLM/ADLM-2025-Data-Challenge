Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Beta-2 Glycoprotein
Antibody, IgG Analysis
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedure for the analysis
of Beta-2 Glycoprotein Antibody, IgG in patient specimens. This
assay is used for the detection and quantification of IgG antibodies
against Beta-2 Glycoprotein, aiding in the diagnosis of autoimmune
disorders such as antiphospholipid syndrome.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all personnel involved in the analysis of
Beta-2 Glycoprotein Antibody, IgG in a CLIA-certified laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the laboratory personnel to:
• Follow this SOP accurately
• Document all steps and findings
• Perform necessary quality control and maintenance according to
the laboratory guidelines
• Report any deviations or issues to the supervising laboratory
scientist
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen type: Serum
• Collection Tube: Plain red-top or serum separator tube (SST)
• Volume: Minimum of 1 mL serum
• Stability: Serum should be separated from cells within 2 hours of
collection. Specimens are stable for up to 7 days at 2-8°C. For
long-term storage, freeze at -20°C or colder. Avoid repeated
freeze-thaw cycles.
5. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Microplate reader capable of reading at 450 nm
• Incubator set at 37°C
• Precision pipettes
• Vortex mixer
• Wash bottle or automated plate washer
• Beta-2 Glycoprotein Antibody, IgG ELISA kit (commercially
available)
◦ Assay buffer
◦ Washing buffer
◦ Calibrators
◦ Enzyme conjugate
◦ Substrate solution
◦ Stop solution
• Timer
6. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation
1. Bring all reagents and serum specimens to room temperature
(20-25°C) before use.
2. Set up the microplate according to the ELISA kit instructions,
ensuring that calibrators, controls, and patient samples are
included.
3. Label the microplate appropriately with patient identifiers and
controls.
B) Assay Steps
1. Calibrator and Sample Addition
◦ Add 100 µL of each calibrator, control, and serum sample to
the assigned wells.
◦ Ensure pipette tips are changed between samples to avoid
cross-contamination.
2. Incubation with Enzyme Conjugate
◦ Add 100 µL of enzyme conjugate to each well.
◦ Cover the plate and incubate at 37°C for 60 minutes.
3. Washing Steps
◦ Aspirate the contents of each well and wash the plate with
the provided washing buffer.
◦ Perform each wash step a total of 3 times, ensuring
complete removal of liquid each time.
4. Substrate Addition
◦ Add 100 µL of substrate solution to each well.
◦ Incubate the plate in the dark at room temperature for 10-15
minutes, or until the desired color development is achieved.
5. Stop Reaction
◦ Add 100 µL of stop solution to each well to halt the
enzymatic reaction.
◦ Mix thoroughly by gently tapping the side of the plate.
C) Reading the Plate
1. Read the absorbance at 450 nm within 10 minutes of adding
the stop solution.
2. Ensure the microplate reader is correctly calibrated and the
readings are within the linear range of the assay.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
Quality control samples must be included in each run and must fall
within the established control ranges for the test run to be valid. If QC
results are out of range, the run is invalid, and the assay must be
repeated.
8. CALCULATING AND REPORTING RESULTS
1. Calculation:
◦ Generate a calibration curve using the absorbance values of
the calibrators.
◦ Determine the concentration of Beta-2 Glycoprotein
Antibody, IgG in patient samples by interpolation from the
calibration curve.
2. Result Reporting:
◦ Report results in GPL units as determined by the calibration
curve.
◦ Reference range: Typically < 20 GPL is considered
negative, 20-80 GPL is borderline, and > 80 GPL is positive.
Note specific ranges as per kit instructions.
◦ Include appropriate interpretive comments on the laboratory
report.
9. REFERENCE INTERVAL
Reference intervals are defined by kit insert and/or validation
protocols at your facility. Typically:
• Negative: < 20 GPL
• Borderline: 20-80 GPL
• Positive: > 80 GPL
10. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolysis, lipemia, and icterus can interfere with test results.
• Incorrect washing may lead to inaccurate results.
• Validate the method internally if transferred from a different
platform or manufacturer instructions.

12. DOCUMENTATION
Record all test results, including QC outcomes and patient results,
electronically in the Laboratory Information System (LIS) and
maintain logs as required by the laboratory’s policy.
This protocol ensures the standardized and accurate analysis of
Beta-2 Glycoprotein Antibody, IgG, enhancing diagnostic reliability for
autoimmune conditions within a CLIA-certified laboratory.
