Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
BETA-2 GLYCOPROTEIN ANTIBODY, IGM Testing
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this standard operating procedure (SOP) is to outline
the protocol for the analytical phase of generating results for Beta-2
Glycoprotein Antibody, IgM.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to laboratory personnel responsible for performing
the Beta-2 Glycoprotein Antibody, IgM test. The test is typically used
to aid the diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) in
conjunction with other diagnostic criteria.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all laboratory personnel to adhere to the
procedures outlined in this SOP to ensure accurate and reliable test
results. The designated supervisor is responsible for ensuring
compliance and addressing any issues that arise during the analytical
process.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen Type:
• Serum (preferred) or plasma (collected in EDTA or heparinized
tubes).
Specimen Volume:
• Minimum required volume: 0.5 mL serum or plasma.
• Preferred volume: 1 mL serum or plasma.
Specimen Stability:
• Samples should be kept at room temperature for no more than 8
hours.
• If a delay in testing is anticipated, specimens should be
refrigerated at 2-8°C for up to 48 hours.
• For long-term storage, specimens should be frozen at -20°C or
colder. Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
Specimen Rejection Criteria:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
• Samples that are improperly labeled or have insufficient volume.
• Specimens that have been stored improperly.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Microplate reader capable of measuring absorbance at 450 nm
with reference wavelengths at 620 nm.
• Incubator set at 37°C.
• Precision pipettes and tips (10 µL to 1000 µL).
• Vortex mixer.
• Microcentrifuge.
Reagents:
• Beta-2 Glycoprotein Antibody, IgM ELISA kit (compliant with
manufacturer's instructions and not expired).
• Wash buffer, diluent, substrate solution, stop solution, and other
reagents as provided in the ELISA kit.
• Deionized or distilled water.
Supplies:
• 96-well microplate.
• Microplate sealing foil.
• Laboratory-grade gloves, lab coat, and eye protection.
• Absorbent disposable material for any spills.
6. PROCEDURE
Preparation of Reagents and Samples:
1. Bring all reagents and specimens to room temperature
(20-25°C) prior to use.
2. Prepare the wash buffer and other kit reagents according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
3. Dilute patient specimens and controls according to the protocol
specified in the ELISA kit.
Assay Procedure:
1. Sample and Reagent Addition:
◦ Pipette the appropriate volume of diluted standards,
controls, and patient samples into the designated wells.
◦ Add the specified volume of enzyme conjugate to each well.
◦ Gently tap the plate to mix.
2. Incubation:
◦ Cover the plate with sealing foil and incubate at 37°C for the
duration specified by the kit manufacturer (typically 30-60
minutes).
3. Washing:
◦ Aspirate and wash each well multiple times with the
prepared wash buffer. Complete removal of liquid at each
step is essential.
4. Substrate Addition:
◦ Add the specified volume of substrate solution to each well.
◦ Incubate in the dark at room temperature for the duration
specified by the manufacturer (typically 15-30 minutes).
5. Stopping the Reaction:
◦ Add stop solution to each well in the same order as the
substrate was added.
◦ Gently tap the plate to ensure thorough mixing.
6. Measurement:
◦ Read the plate immediately using a microplate reader set to
450 nm with a reference wavelength of 620 nm.
7. CALCULATIONS AND INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
1. Calculation:
◦ Generate a standard curve by plotting the mean absorbance
for each standard on the y-axis against its concentration on
the x-axis. Draw a best-fit curve through the points.
◦ Use the standard curve to determine the concentration of
Beta-2 Glycoprotein Antibody, IgM in patient samples.
2. Interpretation:
◦ Compare the calculated concentrations with the reference
ranges provided by the kit manufacturer.
◦ Report results as either positive or negative based on the
cutoff values specified.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
Internal Quality Control:
• Run positive and negative controls with each assay to ensure the
accuracy and precision of the assay.
• Ensure that control results fall within the established ranges
before accepting patient results.
External Quality Control:
• Participate in an external quality assurance program to
periodically validate the assay's performance.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
• Verify the integrity of the results before reporting.
• Enter the results into the laboratory information system (LIS).
• Review and validate results according to site-specific reporting
guidelines.
10. LIMITATIONS
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples may interfere with the
assay results.
• Other autoimmune conditions may produce elevated levels of
Beta-2 Glycoprotein Antibody, IgM which may not be related to
antiphospholipid syndrome.
11. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's instructions and product insert for the Beta-2
Glycoprotein Antibody, IgM ELISA kit.

handling and processing of laboratory specimens.
12. REVISION HISTORY
• Documentation of any changes or updates to the procedure
should be recorded here with dates and descriptions of changes.
13. APPROVAL
This SOP is approved by the laboratory director or designated
personnel.
