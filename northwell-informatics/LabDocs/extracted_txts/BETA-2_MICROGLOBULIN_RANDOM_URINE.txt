Standard Operating Procedure for Beta-2 Microglobulin,
Random, Urine
1. PURPOSE
To establish a standardized protocol for the analytical measurement
of Beta-2 Microglobulin in a random urine specimen in order to
ensure accuracy, precision, and reliability of results.
Responsibility: All designated laboratory personnel are responsible
for following this procedure to ensure the integrity of the test results.
Supervisors must ensure that all personnel are trained and
competent in performing this protocol.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/acceptable:
• A random urine specimen collected in a sterile container. A
minimum volume of 10 mL is recommended to guarantee
sufficient sample for both testing and repeat purposes if needed.
• The specimen must be delivered to the laboratory within 2 hours
of collection. If the specimen cannot be analyzed immediately, it
should be stored at 2-8°C and must be processed within 24
hours.
Unacceptable:
• Specimens that have been stored at room temperature for more
than 2 hours before delivery.
• Specimens with no collection date/time indicated on the container
or accompanying requisition.
• Specimens contaminated with feces, toilet paper, or other foreign
materials.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• Automated analyzer capable of measuring Beta-2 Microglobulin
concentrations, validated for urine samples.
• Beta-2 Microglobulin assay reagent kit
• Control materials (negative and positive controls)
• Calibrators for Beta-2 Microglobulin
• Sterile sample cups
• Pipettes and tips
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
1. PROCEDURE
4.1 Preparation:
• Wear appropriate PPE (gloves, lab coat, safety glasses) before
handling specimens.
• Ensure the automated analyzer and reagents are at operating
temperature and calibrated as per the manufacturer’s guidelines.
4.2 Calibration:
• Calibrate the analyzer using the Beta-2 Microglobulin calibrators
as per the manufacturer’s instructions. Record calibration results
on the Calibration Log.
4.3 Quality Control:
• Run quality controls (negative and positive) at the beginning of
each shift or when new reagent kits are used.
• Verify control results are within acceptable ranges before
proceeding with patient specimens.
• Document control results in the Quality Control Log.
4.4 Specimen Handling:
• Mix the urine specimen well by gentle inversion for 5-10 seconds.
• If the specimen appears cloudy, centrifuge for 5 minutes at 3000
rpm and use the supernatant.
• Aliquot an appropriate volume of urine for analysis according to
the assay kit instructions (generally 50-100 µL).
4.5 Analysis:
• Load the urine aliquot into the analyzer.
• Select the Beta-2 Microglobulin assay on the instrument.
• Start the analysis and document the sample ID, date, and time in
the analyzer's logbook.
• Allow the instrument to process the sample as per the automated/
manual instructions provided by the reagent kit.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Review the results generated by the analyzer for each specimen.
• Enter the results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Verify and validate the results ensuring that the correct reference
intervals are applied.
• Record any critical or unusual findings and notify the appropriate
personnel per laboratory policy.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Adult: < 0.3 mg/L
• Pediatric Values: Age-specific reference intervals to be consulted
from standard guidelines or provided by the assay manufacturer.
1. QUALITY CONTROL AND TROUBLESHOOTING
• If quality control results fall outside the acceptable limits,
troubleshoot the cause by checking reagent integrity, calibration
status, and instrument maintenance logs.
• Repeat the quality control analysis after corrective actions have
been taken.
• Document any troubleshooting procedures and corrective actions
in the Quality Control Log.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hematuria or high protein levels in urine can interfere with the
Beta-2 Microglobulin assay.
• Beta-2 Microglobulin is susceptible to degradation in acidic or
highly alkaline urine specimens.
• High glucose concentrations can cause false elevations in Beta-2
Microglobulin measurements.
1. REFERENCE
• Beta-2 Microglobulin Assay Kit Package Insert (Manufacture:
[specific manufacturer details], Catalog Number: [specific catalog
number]).
• Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines for
urine specimen handling (GP16-A2).
1. REVIEW AND APPROVAL
• This SOP is to be reviewed annually, and revisions made as
needed based on current laboratory practices and technological
advancements.
• Approval by Laboratory Director:
