Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for BETA-2
TRANSFERRIN: DETECTION OF SPINAL FLUID IN OTHER BODY
FLUID
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized method for the detection of Beta-2
Transferrin in body fluids other than spinal fluid. The presence of
Beta-2 Transferrin is a specific marker for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).
This test is used to determine the presence of CSF in other body
fluids, such as nasal or ear discharge.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory staff will perform and document the testing
procedure.
• It is the responsibility of all staff to ensure adherence to this SOP
and to report any issues or deviations to a supervisor.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
- Collect specimens in sterile containers. - Acceptable specimens:
Nasal fluid, ear fluid, or other body fluids where CSF leak is
suspected. - Unacceptable specimens: Specimens that are not
collected in a sterile manner, are severely hemolyzed, or are clearly
contaminated. - Minimum volume: 1 mL of fluid is required for
analysis. - Storage and Stability: Store specimens at 2-8°C if not
tested immediately. Specimens should be tested within 72 hours of
collection. If testing will be delayed for more than 72 hours, freeze the
specimen at -20°C or lower.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
- Automated electrophoresis analyzer or manual electrophoresis
equipment. - Specific anti-human Beta-2 Transferrin antibodies. -
SDS-PAGE gel or specialized isoelectric focusing gel. - Power supply
for electrophoresis. - Standard laboratory glassware and pipettes. -
Gel staining and destaining solutions.
4. PROCEDURE
Preparation and Sample Handling:
• Ensure all reagents and equipment are calibrated and ready for
use.
• Thaw frozen specimens at room temperature and mix gently by
inversion.
Electrophoresis Protocol:
1. Preheat the electrophoresis apparatus to the required
temperature (usually around 100-150V for SDS-PAGE or
according to the specific gel manufacturer's instructions for
isoelectric focusing).
2. Load standard Beta-2 Transferrin controls and patient
specimens onto the gel.
3. Place the gel into the electrophoresis chamber, carefully adding
the appropriate running buffer.
4. Connect the power supply and run the electrophoresis for the
required time (e.g., 1-2 hours for SDS-PAGE).
Detection:
1. After the electrophoresis, remove the gel and place it into the
staining solution (e.g., Coomassie Blue or Silver stain) for the
specified time.
2. After staining, wash the gel in destaining solution until the
background is clear, and protein bands are visible.
Interpretation:
1. Compare the migration pattern of Beta-2 Transferrin in patient
samples to that of the known standard control.
2. Identify the characteristic Beta-2 Transferrin band or isoform,
specifically focusing on its unique migration position relative to
standard serum transferrin bands.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run positive and negative controls with each batch of patient
samples to ensure accurate detection.
• Document lot numbers and expiration dates of reagents used.
• Review and document calibration verifications for electrophoresis
equipment before use.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
• Record the presence or absence of the Beta-2 Transferrin band in
patient specimens.
• Report results as "Positive for Beta-2 Transferrin (indicative of
CSF)" or "Negative for Beta-2 Transferrin (no CSF detected)."
• Ensure that all results are reviewed by a qualified laboratory
technologist before final reporting.
7. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Positive Control: Should consistently show the presence of Beta-2
Transferrin.
• Negative Control: Should show no Beta-2 Transferrin band.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Ensure that samples are not hemolyzed or contaminated, as this
can affect the accuracy of the test results.
• Be cautious of false positives due to technical errors during
electrophoresis or staining.
