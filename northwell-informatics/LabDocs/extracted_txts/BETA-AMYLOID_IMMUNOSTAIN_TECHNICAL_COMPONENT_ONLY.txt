STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES (SOP)
Name of Procedure: BETA-AMYLOID IMMUNOSTAIN, TECHNICAL
COMPONENT ONLY
1. PURPOSE: To provide a standardized protocol for performing
the BETA-AMYLOID IMMUNOSTAIN test, technical component
only, ensuring that all procedures are followed correctly to
achieve accurate and reproducible results. This test is used to
identify the presence of beta-amyloid plaques in tissue
specimens, which are typically associated with Alzheimer's
disease and other neuropathological conditions.
2. RESPONSIBILITY: It is the responsibility of all designated
laboratory personnel to perform this procedure as outlined. It is
the responsibility of the laboratory supervisor to ensure
personnel are trained in this protocol and that it is followed
correctly.
3. DEFINITION: The BETA-AMYLOID IMMUNOSTAIN test
involves the application of a primary antibody targeted against
beta-amyloid plaques in tissue sections followed by appropriate
visualization methods. Only the technical component of the test,
which includes preparation, staining, and quality control, is
covered in this SOP.
4. SPECIMEN: Preferred: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded
(FFPE) tissue blocks. Unacceptable: Non-FFPE tissue or tissue
that has not been properly fixed or embedded.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES:
• Microtome
• Water bath
• Microscope slides
• Antigen retrieval solution (e.g., citrate buffer, pH 6.0)
• Primary anti-beta-amyloid antibody
• Secondary antibody (HRP-conjugated or alkaline phosphatase-
conjugated)
• Chromogen (e.g., DAB or AEC)
• Counterstain (e.g., hematoxylin)
• PBS (Phosphate Buffered Saline)
• Mounting medium
• Coverslips
• Positive and negative tissue controls
• Timer
1. PROCEDURE: A. Tissue Section Preparation: i. Prepare 4-5
µm thick sections from FFPE tissue blocks using a microtome.
ii. Place sections on charged microscope slides. iii. Heat slides
at 60°C for 1 hour to ensure proper adhesion.
B. Deparaffinization and Rehydration: i. Deparaffinize sections by
placing them in xylene for 2 x 10 minutes. ii. Rehydrate sections
through a series of graded ethanol solutions (100%, 95%, 70%) for 5
minutes each. iii. Rinse sections in distilled water for 5 minutes.
C. Antigen Retrieval: i. Place slides in antigen retrieval solution and
heat in a microwave or water bath at 95-100°C for 20 minutes. ii.
Allow slides to cool in the antigen retrieval solution for 20 minutes at
room temperature. iii. Rinse slides in PBS for 5 minutes.
D. Blocking (if required): i. Apply blocking solution (e.g., 10% normal
serum) to sections for 20 minutes at room temperature. ii. Rinse
slides in PBS for 5 minutes.
E. Primary Antibody Incubation: i. Incubate sections with the primary
anti-beta-amyloid antibody (diluted as per manufacturer’s
instructions) for 1 hour at room temperature or overnight at 4°C. ii.
Rinse slides in PBS for 3 x 5 minutes.
F. Secondary Antibody and Detection: i. Apply secondary antibody to
sections and incubate for 30 minutes at room temperature. ii. Rinse
slides in PBS for 3 x 5 minutes. iii. Apply chromogen solution and
incubate until desired stain intensity develops (1-10 minutes). iv.
Rinse in distilled water.
G. Counterstaining and Mounting: i. Counterstain sections with
hematoxylin for 1-3 minutes. ii. Rinse sections in distilled water. iii.
Dehydrate sections through graded ethanol solutions (70%, 95%,
100%) and clear with xylene. iv. Mount sections with mounting
medium and coverslip.
1. QUALITY CONTROL: i. Include positive and negative control
slides with each staining run to ensure the accuracy and
specificity of staining. ii. Document any deviations from the
protocol and results in the laboratory log.
2. REPORTING RESULTS: i. Results should be documented and
reviewed by a qualified pathologist or designated personnel for
accuracy before being reported. ii. Ensure all results are
entered into the laboratory information system (LIS) accurately.
3. REFERENCE INTERVAL: Refer to pathologist interpretation
and established laboratory reference ranges for interpretation of
results.
4. METHOD LIMITATIONS: Refer to the manufacturer’s
instructions for the primary antibody for any limitations of the
reagent.
