Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Beta-Amyloid Ratio
(1-42/1-40), Spinal Fluid
1. PURPOSE
This SOP describes the analytical process for measuring the Beta-
Amyloid Ratio (1-42/1-40) in spinal fluid specimens. The Beta-
Amyloid Ratio (1-42/1-40) is a biomarker used in the diagnosis and
monitoring of conditions such as Alzheimer's disease. Ensuring
accurate and precise measurement is essential for clinical decision-
making.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
All trained laboratory personnel are responsible for performing the
procedures as outlined in this SOP and for maintaining
documentation of all steps performed. Quality control and assurance
are the responsibility of the laboratory supervisor.
3. DEFINITIONS
Beta-Amyloid (1-42): A specific peptide fragment of the amyloid
precursor protein, often measured in conjunction with Beta-Amyloid
(1-40) to assess amyloid pathology. Beta-Amyloid (1-40): Another
specific peptide fragment of the amyloid precursor protein. Ratio
(1-42/1-40): The ratio of Beta-Amyloid (1-42) to Beta-Amyloid (1-40),
used as a biomarker in clinical assessments.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography (UPLC) or Enzyme-
Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) instrument suitable for
Beta-Amyloid peptide quantification
• Calibrators and controls for Beta-Amyloid (1-42) and Beta-
Amyloid (1-40)
• Pipettes and calibrated pipette tips
• Polypropylene tubes
• Reagent kits specific for Beta-Amyloid (1-42) and Beta-Amyloid
(1-40) assays
• Quality control materials
• Sample diluent
• Wash buffer
• Reaction buffer
• Specialized software for data analysis
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENT AND HANDLING
• Specimen: Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF)
• Volume: A minimum volume of 1 mL is required.
• Collection: Use a sterile technique to collect CSF. Ensure the
specimen is free from blood contamination.
• Storage: Refrigerate specimens immediately after collection at
2-8°C. If analysis is not possible within 24 hours, freeze the
samples at -80°C. Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
6. PROCEDURE
A) Pre-Analytical Phase:
1. Confirm that the received specimens have been properly
labeled and recorded in the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
2. Thaw frozen samples at room temperature and mix gently by
inversion.
3. Centrifuge samples at 2000-3000 x g for 5 minutes to remove
any particulate matter.
4. Aliquot the required volume into a clean, appropriately labeled
polypropylene tube.
B) Analytical Phase:
UPLC Method:
1. Calibrate the UPLC instrument according to the manufacturer's
instructions using the known calibrators.
2. Prepare reagent mixtures and quality control samples as per
reagent kit instructions.
3. Load sample, calibrators, and control samples into the UPLC
auto-sampler.
4. Set the instrument parameters as follows:
◦ Column temperature: 35°C
◦ Mobile phase flow rate: 0.5 mL/min
◦ Injection volume: 10 μL
◦ Detection wavelength: 214 nm
5. Run a blank sample to ensure the system is free from
contaminants.
6. Analyze the patient samples, calibrators, and quality control
samples.
7. Review and accept the assay based on quality control results
being within expected ranges.
ELISA Method:
1. Prepare the ELISA plate by adding capture antibody to wells
and blocking nonspecific binding sites.
2. Add 100 μL of the sample, standards, and controls to the
respective wells.
3. Incubate the plate as directed, typically at room temperature for
2 hours.
4. Wash the plate with wash buffer to remove unbound
substances.
5. Add 100 μL of detection antibody to each well and incubate for
the recommended time.
6. Wash the plate again to remove excess detection antibody.
7. Add 100 μL of substrate solution to each well, incubate until
color develops.
8. Stop the reaction by adding stop solution to each well.
9. Read the plate at 450 nm using an ELISA plate reader.
10. Analyze the results with plate reader software, ensuring
calibration and controls are within acceptable ranges.
C) Post-Analytical Phase:
1. Calculate the Beta-Amyloid Ratio (1-42/1-40) for each sample.
2. Document all results in the LIS, including calibrator and control
assay outcomes.
3. Review all results. If the results are outside the reference range
or show signs of potential errors, re-analyze the sample.
4. Verify and validate results prior to reporting.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Quality control checks must be performed with each analytical
run using low, medium, and high concentration control
materials.
2. Control results must fall within pre-established ranges. If
controls are out of range, troubleshoot the assay according to
the protocol before proceeding with patient samples.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Enter validated results into the LIS.
2. Include comments on any issues observed during the analysis,
including sample integrity or methodological anomalies.
3. Results should be reviewed by a senior technologist or
supervisor before release.
9. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
Refer to specific clinical guidelines and reference ranges for the
interpretation of Beta-Amyloid Ratio (1-42/1-40) values. Deviations
from expected values should prompt re-testing or additional
diagnostic steps.

documented, approved, and communicated to all relevant laboratory
personnel.
