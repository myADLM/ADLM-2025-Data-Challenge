Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for BETA-CATENIN
IMMUNOSTAIN, TECHNICAL COMPONENT ONLY
1. PURPOSE To outline the proper procedure for performing Beta-
Catenin immunostaining in the laboratory, ensuring consistent and
accurate staining results for pathological evaluation.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory technologists are responsible
for carrying out the steps outlined in this procedure. It is also the
responsibility of the technologists and supervisors to monitor and
document the process, including any required corrective actions.
2. DEFINITION AND SCOPE: Beta-Catenin immunostaining refers to
the process of labeling Beta-Catenin proteins within tissue sections
using specific antibodies. This procedure includes all technical steps
from tissue preparation to staining, but excludes result interpretation.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Acceptable: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections.
• Unacceptable: Non-formalin-fixed or improperly preserved
tissues.
4. REAGENTS AND EQUIPMENT:
• Primary Antibody: Anti-Beta-Catenin (ready-to-use or
concentrated format requiring dilution per manufacturer's
instructions)
• Secondary Antibody: Appropriate for the primary antibody type
(e.g., HRP-conjugated)
• Chromogen Substrate: DAB (3,3'-Diaminobenzidine) or other
suitable substrate.
• Buffer Solutions: PBS (phosphate buffered saline)
• Mounting Medium
• Control Slides: Known positive and negative Beta-Catenin
expressing tissues.
• Other Supplies: Microtome, water bath, forced-air slide dryer,
racks, staining dishes, coverslips, and microscope.
5. PROCEDURE A. Tissue Section Preparation:
1. Section paraffin-embedded tissue blocks at 3-4 microns using a
microtome.
2. Place sections in a 40°C water bath, then mount onto positively
charged slides.
3. Dry sections overnight in a 60°C oven or for a minimum of 1
hour.
B. Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
1. Deparaffinize sections in xylene for 2 x 5 minutes.
2. Rehydrate through a graded series of ethanol (100%, 95%,
70%, 50%) for 5 minutes each.
3. Rinse slides in distilled water.
C. Antigen Retrieval:
1. Heat-induced epitope retrieval (HIER): Place slides in a
retrieval buffer (e.g., Citrate buffer pH 6.0) and heat in a
pressure cooker or microwave as per the protocol for 20
minutes.
2. Allow slides to cool at room temperature for 20 minutes.
3. Rinse slides in PBS.
D. Immunostaining:
1. Block endogenous peroxidase activity by incubating slides in
3% hydrogen peroxide solution for 10 minutes.
2. Wash slides in PBS for 3 x 3 minutes.
3. Apply primary antibody (Anti-Beta-Catenin) on tissue sections
and incubate in a humidified chamber for the time specified by
the antibody protocol (typically 1 hour at room temperature).
4. Wash slides in PBS for 3 x 3 minutes.
5. Apply secondary antibody and incubate as per manufacturer’s
instructions (typically 30 minutes).
6. Wash slides in PBS for 3 x 3 minutes.
7. Apply chromogen substrate (e.g., DAB) and incubate until the
desired color intensity is developed (typically 3-10 minutes).
8. Rinse slides in distilled water.
E. Counterstaining and Mounting:
1. Counterstain tissue sections with hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes.
2. Rinse slides in tap water and briefly in acid alcohol to
differentiate.
3. Blue sections in running tap water for 5 minutes.
4. Dehydrate slides through graded ethanol series and clear in
xylene.
5. Mount coverslips with an appropriate mounting medium.
F. Quality Control:
1. Include known Beta-Catenin positive and negative controls with
each staining run.
2. Evaluate control slides before assessing patient tissue sections.
3. Document any deviations in staining quality, and take corrective
actions as necessary.
6. SAFETY PRECAUTIONS:
1. Follow standard laboratory safety protocols, including the use of
personal protective equipment (PPE).
2. Handle all reagents and tissue sections following biosafety
guidelines to prevent exposure to hazardous materials.
7. REPORTING RESULTS:
1. Review stained sections under the microscope to ensure
adequate staining and absence of artifacts.
2. Record any technical observations and pass sections onto the
pathologist for interpretation.
3. Report any issues encountered with the staining procedure to
the supervisor immediately.
8. PROCEDURE REVIEW: This protocol will be reviewed annually or
as needed to ensure compliance with the latest guidelines and
reagents availability.
