Protocol for Analytical Phase of Generating Results for Beta-
Crosslaps (C-Telopeptide)
1. PURPOSE
To establish a standardized procedure for the analysis and reporting
of Beta-Crosslaps (C-telopeptide) levels in human serum or plasma
specimens, ensuring accurate and reliable test results for clinical
diagnosis and monitoring.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory personnel,
including laboratory technologists and supervisors, to ensure that the
Beta-Crosslaps (C-telopeptide) testing is performed, documented,
and reviewed according to this SOP.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Preferred Specimen:
• Serum or EDTA plasma
Specimen Collection:
• Draw blood using standard venipuncture technique.
• Allow the blood sample to clot for serum specimens and
centrifuge within 2 hours of collection.
• For plasma samples, centrifuge the blood with EDTA
anticoagulant immediately after draw.
Specimen Handling:
• Serum or plasma must be separated from cells as soon as
possible.
• Store specimens at 2-8°C if the analysis is to be performed within
72 hours.
• For longer storage, specimens should be frozen at -20°C or lower.
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
• Samples not handled according to the storage and transport
requirements.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Beta-Crosslaps (C-Telopeptide) assay kit (e.g. Roche Elecsys β-
Crosslaps)
• Calibrators and controls specific for Beta-Crosslaps analysis
• Analyzer (e.g., Roche Cobas e411 or similar)
• Standard laboratory supplies (pipettes, tips, tubes, etc.)
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
1. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Wear appropriate PPE (lab coat, gloves, safety glasses).
2. Turn on the analyzer and allow it to warm up as per
manufacturer’s instructions.
3. Check and ensure that all required reagents are within expiry
dates and properly stored.
Calibration and Quality Control:
1. Calibrate the analyzer using the calibration standards provided
in the assay kit.
2. Perform a QC check using the provided control materials to
validate the calibration.
3. Document the calibration and QC results in the appropriate
logbook.
Sample Analysis:
1. Mix the serum/plasma sample thoroughly before analysis.
2. Load the sample into the designated sample cups or racks
according to the analyzer’s instructions.
3. Follow the analyzer’s protocol to process and measure Beta-
Crosslaps levels in the samples.
4. Ensure that the analyzer runs are recorded and monitored for
any errors or anomalies.
Result Generation:
1. Review the generated results for accuracy and consistency with
the analyzer’s report.
2. Compare the patient results with the control and calibration
values to ensure proper function.
3. Validate and approve the results as per laboratory guidelines.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
Internal Quality Control:
• Run internal controls (high, low, and medium) at the start of each
shift.
• Document all QC results and take corrective actions if controls fall
outside acceptable ranges.
External Quality Assurance:
• Participate in external quality assurance programs (e.g., CAP
proficiency testing).
1. REPORTING RESULTS
Reference Intervals:
• Use the manufacturer’s predefined reference intervals for Beta-
Crosslaps or establish laboratory-specific reference intervals if
necessary.
Result Verification:
• Technologist reviews and verifies all patient results.
• Results are automatically transmitted to the Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
• Any critical results must be immediately communicated to the
responsible physician as per the laboratory’s critical results policy.
1. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
• Elevated Beta-Crosslaps levels could indicate increased bone
resorption.
• Lower than normal levels should be interpreted with caution and
in conjunction with clinical findings and other diagnostic tests.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples may interfere with the test
result.
• Ensure all limitations specified in the assay kit insert are adhered
to during the analysis.
