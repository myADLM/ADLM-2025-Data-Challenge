Sure, here's a detailed protocol for the analytical phase of generating
results for BETA-CROSSLAPS, SERUM.
Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Title: BETA-CROSSLAPS,
Serum Analysis
1. PURPOSE
To ensure accurate and reliable quantification of Beta-C-Telopeptides
of Type I Collagen (Beta-CrossLaps) in serum samples for the
diagnosis and monitoring of metabolic bone diseases and other
conditions related to bone resorption.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory personnel to
perform the analysis of Beta-CrossLaps, ensuring that all procedures
are followed correctly and results are properly documented and
reported.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
• Type of Specimen Required: Serum
• Collection Device: Serum Separator Tube (SST)
• Handling and Processing:
◦ Allow the blood to clot for 30 minutes at room temperature.
◦ Centrifuge at 1500 x g for 10 minutes within 1 hour of
collection.
◦ After centrifugation, transfer the serum to a polypropylene or
polyethylene tube if not analyzed immediately.
◦ Store specimens at 2-8°C for up to 48 hours. For long-term
storage, frozen serum at -20°C is acceptable for up to 6
months.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Serum samples that are hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric.
• Samples that have not been centrifuged within the specified
timeframe.
• Samples with grossly visible particulate matter.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Automated Immunoassay Analyzer (e.g., IDS-iSYS Multi-
Discipline Automated System)
• Beta-CrossLaps Reagent Kit
• Control Material: High and Low Control
• Calibrators
• Serum Separator Tubes (SST)
• Pipettes and tips
• Polypropylene or polyethylene tubes for storage
• Quality control documentation logs
1. PROCEDURE
4.1 Instrument Preparation:
• Turn on the analyzer and allow it to perform self-checks as per the
manufacturer's instructions.
• Verify that all reagents, calibrators, and control materials are
within their expiration dates.
• Load the Beta-CrossLaps reagent kit and required supplies onto
the analyzer.
4.2 Calibration:
• Use the provided calibrators to perform a 2-point calibration or as
recommended by the reagent manufacturer.
• Ensure calibration curves are within acceptable limits, then
proceed to quality control.
4.3 Quality Control:
• Run high and low control materials before running patient
samples.
• Document the results of control materials. Acceptable ranges for
the controls should be established and provided.
• If controls are out of range, investigate and resolve issues before
analyzing patient samples.
4.4 Sample Analysis:
• Ensure serum samples are at room temperature before analysis.
• Load serum samples onto the analyzer carousel according to the
instrument's manual.
• Program the analyzer to process the Beta-CrossLaps test
following the manufacturer's protocol.
• Verify that the sample connections are secure and start the
analysis.
4.5 Monitoring and Troubleshooting:
• Monitor the analyzer during the run to ensure it is operating
correctly.
• In case of any deviations, alarm issues, or instrument errors,
follow the troubleshooting guide provided in the instrument
manual.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Review and interpret the results generated by the analyzer.
• Verify results against the calibration curves and quality control
findings.
• Any flagged results or critical values should be reviewed and
reanalyzed if necessary.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS:
• Reference intervals must be established for the population being
tested as they may vary.
• Typical ranges might be provided within the reagent kit insert but
can be as follows (example values):
◦ Adults: 120-420 pg/mL
1. QUALITY CONTROL AND DOCUMENTATION
• Run controls (high, low) at the beginning of each shift or batch
analysis.
• All results, calibration curves, and control results must be
documented in the laboratory's quality control logs and reviewed
daily.
• Any deviations and corrective actions taken should be noted.
1. LIMITATIONS AND INTERFERENCES
Refer to the Beta-CrossLaps reagent kit manufacturer’s insert for
specific limitations. Potential interferences may include:
• Hemolysis, lipemia, or icterus in the serum samples.
• Certain medications and patient conditions influencing bone
metabolism.
• Paraproteins and high concentrations of certain plasma proteins.
