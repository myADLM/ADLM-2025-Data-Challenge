Standard Operating Procedure for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for BETA-GALACTOSIDASE, LEUKOCYTES
1. PURPOSE
To establish a standardized protocol for the analytical phase of
generating results for Beta-Galactosidase and Leukocytes in clinical
specimens to ensure accurate and reliable results.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all staff performing Beta-Galactosidase and
Leukocyte assays within the laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing Beta-
Galactosidase and Leukocyte assays as described in this SOP.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring that staff adhere to this
SOP and for addressing any deviations or issues.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND HANDLING
Specimen Requirements:
• Beta-Galactosidase:
◦ Preferred specimen: Fresh 10 mL blood collected in a
heparinized tube. Avoid hemolysis.
◦ Storage: Specimens should be kept at 2-8°C and analyzed
within 24 hours of collection.
• Leukocytes:
◦ Preferred specimen: Fresh 5 mL blood collected in EDTA tube.
◦ Storage: Specimens should be kept at 2-8°C and analyzed
within 24 hours of collection.
5. REAGENTS AND EQUIPMENT
• Beta-Galactosidase Reagent Kit (commercially available)
• Leukocyte Reagent Kit (commercially available)
• Calibrators and Quality Control materials
• Automated Analyzer or Manual counting chamber to be used as
per manufacturer’s instructions
6. PROCEDURES
A. ANALYSIS OF BETA-GALACTOSIDASE
1. Preparation:
◦ Equilibrate all reagents and specimens to room temperature
before analysis.
◦ Thoroughly mix each specimen before analysis.
2. Calibration:
◦ Calibrate the analyzer using the provided calibrators
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Ensure calibration is within acceptable parameters before
proceeding.
3. Quality Control:
◦ Run quality control (QC) samples at the beginning of each
analytical run.
◦ Acceptable QC ranges must be confirmed before patient
samples are analyzed.
◦ Document all QC results and take corrective actions if QC
results are outside of the acceptable range.
4. Assay Procedure:
◦ Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for running the Beta-
Galactosidase assay on the automated analyzer.
◦ For manual methods, follow the detailed step-by-step
protocol provided in the reagent kit insert.
5. Interpreting Results:
◦ Review all results for consistency and validity.
◦ Repeat testing or verification processes if results appear
inconsistent or fall outside of expected ranges.
B. ANALYSIS OF LEUKOCYTES
1. Preparation:
◦ Equilibrate all reagents and specimens to room temperature
before analysis.
◦ Thoroughly mix each specimen before analysis.
2. Calibration:
◦ Calibrate the analyzer using the provided calibrators
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Ensure calibration is within acceptable parameters before
proceeding.
3. Quality Control:
◦ Run quality control (QC) samples at the beginning of each
analytical run.
◦ Acceptable QC ranges must be confirmed before patient
samples are analyzed.
◦ Document all QC results and take corrective actions if QC
results are outside of the acceptable range.
4. Assay Procedure:
◦ Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for running the
Leukocyte assay on the automated analyzer.
◦ For manual methods, prepare a blood film and count
leukocytes under a microscope using a designated counting
chamber.
5. Interpreting Results:
◦ Review all results for consistency and validity.
◦ Repeat testing or verification processes if results appear
inconsistent or fall outside of expected ranges.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
• Beta-Galactosidase: Quantitative results should be reported in
units/ml (U/mL).
• Leukocytes: Quantitative results should be reported as number
of cells per microliter (cells/µL).
8. QUALITY ASSURANCE
• Regularly maintain and calibrate all equipment as specified by the
manufacturer’s guidelines.
• Perform routine proficiency testing and participate in external
quality assessment schemes.
• Document all maintenance, calibration, quality control, and
proficiency testing activities.
9. TROUBLESHOOTING
• Refer to the manufacturer’s manual for troubleshooting common
issues.
• Consult with a supervisor or technical support for unresolved
issues.
10. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s reagent kit inserts for Beta-Galactosidase and
Leukocyte assays.
• Laboratory internal quality control and calibration logs.
11. REVISION HISTORY
• Document any revisions to this SOP including the date of revision
and a summary of changes made.
Note: This SOP is to be reviewed annually or as required by changes
in protocols, reagents, or equipment.
