Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: BETA-GLOBIN GENE CLUSTER DELETION/DUPLICATION,
BLOOD – Analytical Phase
1. Purpose
The purpose of this SOP is to detail the steps for the analytical phase
in the detection of deletions or duplications in the beta-globin gene
cluster in blood samples. This procedure ensures accurate and
reliable results for clinical diagnostic purposes.
2. Specimen Requirements
• Specimen Type: Peripheral blood
• Volume Required: 5-10 mL
• Collection Container: EDTA (lavender top) tube
• Specimen Stability:
◦ Room Temperature: 24 hours
◦ Refrigerated: 72 hours
3. Procedure
3.1 DNA Extraction
1. Preparation of Materials and Reagents:
◦ Ensure all materials and reagents (e.g., DNA extraction kits)
are prepared as per manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Label all tubes and containers appropriately.
2. Sample Handling:
◦ Verify patient information on the blood sample against the
requisition form.
◦ Gently mix the sample by inverting the EDTA tube 5-10
times.
3. Extraction Protocol:
◦ Aliquot 200 µL of whole blood into a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge
tube.
◦ Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for the DNA
extraction kit.
◦ Elute the DNA in an appropriate buffer or nuclease-free
water.
3.2 DNA Quantification and Quality Assessment
1. Quantification:
◦ Measure DNA concentration using a spectrophotometer
(e.g., NanoDrop) at 260 nm.
◦ Record the DNA concentration in ng/µL.
2. Quality Assessment:
◦ Check purity by calculating the 260/280 absorbance ratio
(acceptable range: 1.8-2.0).
◦ Run a small portion of the extracted DNA (e.g., 5 µL) on a
1% agarose gel to assess integrity.
3.3 Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA)
1. MLPA Reagents and Preparation:
◦ Prepare the MLPA reagent mix as per the manufacturer’s
protocol.
◦ Denature 100 ng of genomic DNA in each reaction tube.
2. Hybridization, Ligation, and Amplification:
◦ Perform hybridization at 60°C for 16-20 hours.
◦ Add ligation master mix and conduct ligation at 54°C for 15
minutes.
◦ Perform PCR amplification using the thermocycler with the
specified program.
3.4 Fragment Analysis
1. Capillary Electrophoresis:
◦ Prepare the PCR products for analysis by mixing with
formamide and a size standard.
◦ Load samples onto a capillary electrophoresis instrument
(e.g., ABI PRISM).
2. Data Acquisition and Analysis:
◦ Collect data using the corresponding analysis software.
◦ Analyze fragment profiles to determine the presence or
absence of deletions/duplications in the beta-globin gene
cluster.
3.5 Results Interpretation
1. Interpretation Criteria:
◦ Compare the sample peak patterns to a normal control.
◦ Identify shifts in peak heights indicative of deletions or
duplications.
2. Quality Control:
◦ Include positive and negative controls in each run.
◦ Ensure internal control peaks are present in each sample.
4. Quality Control and Maintenance
• Ensure all reagents are within their expiration date.
• Calibrate instruments as per manufacturer’s guidelines.
• Verify control results before accepting patient sample results.
5. Reporting Results
1. Result Documentation:
◦ Document patient results in the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
◦ Ensure results are reviewed and verified by the designated
technologist.
2. Result Interpretation:
◦ Provide a written report detailing detected deletions/
duplications.
◦ Include recommendation for genetic counseling if clinically
significant variants are detected.
6. References
• Manufacturer’s instructions for DNA extraction kits and MLPA
reagents.
• Relevant clinical guidelines for the interpretation of beta-globin
gene cluster deletions/duplications.
7. Responsibility
• It is the responsibility of the laboratory technologist and supervisor
to ensure adherence to this SOP and to maintain compliance with
quality control procedures.
