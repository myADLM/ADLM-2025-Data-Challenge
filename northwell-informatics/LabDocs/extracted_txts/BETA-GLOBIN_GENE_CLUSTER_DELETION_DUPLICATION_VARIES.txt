Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for BETA-GLOBIN GENE
CLUSTER, DELETION/DUPLICATION, VARIES
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for the detection and analysis of deletions
and duplications in the beta-globin gene cluster using high-resolution
techniques. The protocol ensures the consistent and accurate
generation of results.
Responsibility:
Designated lab technologists are responsible for performing the
analysis according to this SOP. Supervisors and designated staff
must ensure the procedures are adhered to, including any necessary
corrective actions.
2. DEFINITION
The beta-globin gene cluster includes the genes responsible for
encoding the β-hemoglobin protein. Deletions and duplications within
this region can lead to various hemoglobinopathies, including
thalassemia and sickle cell disease.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/acceptable:
• 5-10 mL of Whole Blood collected in EDTA tube.
• DNA extracted from whole blood stored appropriately (0.5 µg
minimum).
Unacceptable:
• Specimens that are hemolyzed or clotted.
• Specimens collected in heparin or citrate.
• Specimens without an identifier (name, date of birth).
Ensure the specimen has been properly stored and transported to
the lab within 24 hours of collection to maintain optimal DNA quality.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• ddPCR System (e.g., Bio-Rad QX200 Droplet Digital PCR
System)
• PCR reagents (e.g., TaqMan probes, primers targeting the beta-
globin gene cluster)
• Nuclease-free water
• DNA Extraction Kits (e.g., Qiagen QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit)
• Spectrophotometer or fluorometer for DNA quantification
• 2% Agarose Gel electrophoresis system for quality verification
• Temperature controlled storage for reagents
• Thermal cycler
• Microcentrifuge tubes
• Pipettes and filtered tips
5. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation:
1. DNA Extraction:
◦ Extract DNA from whole blood using the designated DNA
extraction kit.
◦ Quantify and assess the purity of the DNA using a
spectrophotometer or fluorometer. Acceptable purity ratios
(A260/A280) should range between 1.8-2.0.
2. ddPCR Setup:
◦ Prepare the ddPCR mix according to manufacturer's
protocols, including primers and TaqMan probes specific for
the beta-globin gene cluster.
◦ Prepare 20 µL ddPCR reaction volumes in microcentrifuge
tubes.
◦ Generate droplet partitions using the droplet generator.
B. PCR Amplification:
1. Thermal Cycling:
◦ Transfer droplets to a 96-well PCR plate.
◦ Follow the specific thermal cycling protocol:
▪ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 10 minutes
▪ Denaturation: 94°C for 30 seconds (40 cycles)
▪ Annealing/Extension: 60°C for 1 minute (40 cycles)
▪ Final Extension: 98°C for 10 minutes
C. Data Acquisition:
1. Droplet Reading:
◦ After amplification, load droplets into the plate reader.
◦ Use the software associated with the ddPCR system to
count positive and negative droplets for each target and
reference.
D. Data Analysis:
1. Data Interpretation:
◦ Analyze the data using the ddPCR software, calculating the
concentration of target sequences.
◦ Determine the presence or absence of deletions/
duplications within the beta-globin gene cluster.
◦ Perform necessary controls and validation steps to ensure
sample integrity and accuracy of results.
E. Quality Control:
1. QC:
◦ Perform controls and standards alongside patient samples
to ensure assay validity.
◦ Verify results against known positive and negative controls.
◦ Troubleshoot and take corrective action if outliers or
inconsistencies are observed.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
• Document results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Results must include concentration values and indicate the
presence/absence of deletions or duplications.
• Review and verify results before final reporting.
7. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Report deletions or duplications as detected or not detected; refer to
established clinical interpretation guidelines for assessment of
specific variants.
8. RESULT LIMITATIONS
Refer to manufacturer’s guidelines for limitations inherent to ddPCR
assay and detection limits for the beta-globin gene cluster.

10. NOTES
Maintain proper documentation and store all logs and results for the
required retention period. Ensure all equipment is calibrated and
maintained as per the laboratory’s protocols. Perform periodic
proficiency testing to ensure ongoing accuracy and reliability in
detection and analysis.
