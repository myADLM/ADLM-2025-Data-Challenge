Title: Standard Operating Procedure for Beta-Globin Gene
Sequencing, Blood
1. PURPOSE
To ensure the accurate and reliable sequencing of the beta-globin
gene from peripheral blood specimens for the diagnosis of
hemoglobinopathies, including thalassemias and other beta-globin
gene mutations.
2. PRINCIPLE
Beta-globin gene sequencing involves the amplification and
sequencing of the beta-globin gene to identify mutations. The results
of these tests are used to aid in the diagnosis and management of
disorders related to the beta-globin gene.
3. SPECIMEN
Preferred acceptable specimen:
• Whole blood collected in EDTA (lavender top) tubes.
• Minimum volume required: 3-5 mL.
• Specimen should be stored at 2-8°C and processed within 5 days
of collection.
Unacceptable specimen:
• Clotted blood samples.
• Hemolyzed specimens.
• Specimens in anticoagulants other than EDTA.
• Specimens received after 5 days from the collection date.
4. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• PCR thermal cycler
• Sequencing Reagents:
◦ Beta-globin specific primers
◦ PCR Master Mix
◦ DNA Polymerase
• Sequencing instruments and consumables, e.g., capillary
sequencer
• Positive and negative control DNA
• Molecular grade water
• Gloves, pipette tips, pipettes, and other laboratory consumables
5. PROCEDURE
A. DNA Extraction:
1. Extract DNA from peripheral blood using a validated DNA
extraction kit following the manufacturer's instructions.
2. Quantify and assess the purity of the DNA using a
spectrophotometer. Acceptable purity (A260/280 ratio) is
between 1.8 to 2.0.
3. Store the extracted DNA at -20°C until further use.
B. PCR Amplification of Beta-Globin Gene:
1. Prepare the PCR reaction mix containing:
◦ PCR Master Mix
◦ Beta-globin specific primers
◦ DNA template (50-100 ng/reaction)
◦ Molecular grade water to bring the volume to the required
amount (usually 50 µl per reaction)
2. Mix the reaction components gently and aliquot into PCR tubes
or plates.
3. Load the tubes into the PCR thermal cycler and run the
following program:
◦ Initial denaturation at 95°C for 2 minutes
◦ 35 cycles of:
▪ Denaturation at 95°C for 30 seconds
▪ Annealing at 55-60°C (depending on primer's melting
temperature) for 30 seconds
▪ Extension at 72°C for 1 minute
◦ Final extension at 72°C for 5 minutes
4. Store PCR products at 4°C until sequencing.
C. DNA Sequencing:
1. Purify the PCR products using a PCR purification kit following
the manufacturer's instructions.
2. Quantify the purified PCR products and ensure adequate DNA
concentration (20-50 ng/µl).
3. Prepare the sequencing reaction mix consisting of:
◦ Purified PCR product
◦ Sequencing primers (forward and reverse)
◦ Sequencing reagents as specified by the sequencing kit
manufacturer
4. Load onto the capillary sequencer as per instrument protocol.
5. Run the sequencing reaction under the following conditions
(example):
◦ Initial denaturation at 95°C for 1 minute
◦ 25 cycles of:
▪ Denaturation at 95°C for 10 seconds
▪ Annealing at 50-60°C for 5 seconds
▪ Extension at 60°C for 4 minutes
6. Analyze the sequencing results using sequencing analysis
software.
D. Data Analysis and Interpretation:
1. Compare the obtained sequences to the reference beta-globin
gene sequence (GenBank accession number: NM_000518)
using sequence alignment software.
2. Identify and classify mutations according to established
guidelines (e.g., Human Gene Mutation Database).
3. Interpret the clinical significance of identified mutations and
document the findings.
6. QUALITY CONTROL:
1. Include positive controls (known beta-globin mutations) and
negative controls (no DNA template) in each run.
2. Ensure that the sequencing system passes calibration and
performance checks as required.
3. Maintain detailed logs of all reagents, control results, and
equipment used.
4. Document any discrepancies and perform repeat testing if
results are inconsistent.
7. REPORTING RESULTS:
1. Verify and sign off test results.
2. Report the findings according to the laboratory's reporting
guidelines.
3. Include description of identified mutations and potential clinical
implications.
4. Ensure results are transmitted to the requesting physician or
entered into the LIS securely and confidentially.
