Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analysis of BETA-
GLUCURONIDASE, BLOOD SPOT
1. PURPOSE
To provide standardized procedures for the analysis of BETA-
GLUCURONIDASE activity in dried blood spot (DBS) samples to
ensure accurate and consistent results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all trained laboratory personnel to adhere to
the protocol. Any issues or deviations observed during the analytical
process should be reported to the laboratory supervisor immediately.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Dried blood spot (DBS)
• Collection Instructions: Follow standard blood spot collection
techniques. Blood spots should be completely dried before
transport.
• Storage: Store DBS cards at room temperature or refrigerated
(2-8°C). Avoid exposure to direct sunlight and moisture.
4. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Spectrophotometer or fluorometer
• Incubator set to 37°C
• Analytical balance
• Microcentrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Microplate reader
• Buffer solutions (as specified in the reagent kit)
• Substrate solution (4-Methylumbelliferyl-β-D-glucuronide or
equivalent)
• Standard calibrators
• Quality control samples
5. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation of Reagents and Standards
1. Prepare all necessary reagents as per manufacturer’s
instructions.
2. Calibrate the spectrophotometer or fluorometer as per the
equipment's operational manual.
3. Prepare working standards and quality control samples as
specified in the kit insert.
B. Sample Preparation
1. Punch out a 3-mm diameter disc from the center of each blood
spot sample.
2. Place the punched discs into individual wells of a 96-well
microplate or separate labeled microcentrifuge tubes.
C. Enzyme Extraction
1. Add 100 µL of the specified extraction buffer to each well
containing the blood spot punch.
2. Incubate the microplate or tubes at 37°C for 1 hour with
shaking.
3. Vortex to ensure thorough mixing.
D. Enzyme Assay
1. Add 100 µL of substrate solution to each well.
2. Incubate the plate or tubes at 37°C for the specified time
(usually 1-2 hours).
3. After incubation, stop the reaction by adding 50 µL of stop
buffer (if required).
E. Measurement
1. Measure the fluorescence (excitation at 365 nm and emission
at 450 nm) or absorbance at 405 nm (for colorimetric assays).
2. Compare the fluorescence or absorbance readings with the
standard curve to determine the enzyme activity in the samples.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Run quality control samples (both positive and negative
controls) with each batch of patient samples.
2. Ensure all control results are within specified ranges before
reporting patient results.
3. If control results fall outside the acceptable range, troubleshoot
the assay and repeat the test if necessary.
7. CALCULATION AND INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
1. Plot the standard curve using standard calibrator values.
2. Calculate the BETA-GLUCURONIDASE activity in blood spot
samples based on the standard curve.
3. Report the results in the designated units (e.g., µmol/L/hour).
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Enter results into the laboratory information system (LIS).
• Ensure results are reviewed and verified by the technologist
before releasing them.
• Report any critical or abnormal results to the requesting
healthcare provider immediately.
9. MAINTENANCE AND TROUBLESHOOTING
• Perform regular maintenance on the spectrophotometer/
fluorometer as per the manufacturer’s guidelines.
• Document any issues and troubleshooting steps taken during the
analytical process.
10. HEALTH AND SAFETY
• Follow standard laboratory safety protocols.
• Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) including
gloves and lab coat.
• Dispose of biological samples and reagents according to
biohazard waste disposal regulations.
