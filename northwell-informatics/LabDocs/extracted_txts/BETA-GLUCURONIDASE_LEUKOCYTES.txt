Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Beta-Glucuronidase and
Leukocytes Analysis
1. PURPOSE To provide a standardized method for the analysis
of beta-glucuronidase and leukocytes in human specimens.
This protocol ensures accuracy, reliability, and timely
processing of results in a CLIA-certified laboratory.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory technologists perform the
analysis following this protocol. Supervisors ensure that temperature
monitoring of equipment, quality control, and documentation are done
according to the procedure.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY Specimen
Type:
• Fresh urine: Preferred for leukocytes analysis within 6 hours of
collection.
• Heparinized blood or serum: Preferred for beta-glucuronidase
analysis.
Transport and Storage:
• Urine specimens should be transported to the lab within 6 hours
at 4-25°C.
• Blood or serum specimens should be transported immediately at
2-8°C.
• Both specimen types should be handled to avoid sample
deterioration.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Urine arriving in the lab more than 6 hours after collection.
• Blood samples showing signs of hemolysis or clotting.
• Specimens not properly labeled with collection date/time.
1. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
• Automated analyzers for beta-glucuronidase.
• Reagent strips, such as Siemens Multistix, for leukocyte testing.
• Temperature-controlled centrifuge.
• Quality control materials.
• Laboratory information system (LIS) for result reporting.
1. PROCEDURE
A) Beta-Glucuronidase Analysis
1. Specimen preparation:
◦ Centrifuge the blood/serum specimen at 1500 rpm for 10
minutes.
◦ Aliquot serum into a labeled test tube.
2. Analyzer setup:
◦ Ensure the automated analyzer is calibrated and
maintenance checks are performed.
◦ Load the serum aliquot into the analyzer.
3. Result generation:
◦ Start the analysis and wait for the analyzer to process the
sample.
◦ Review the generated results for any error messages or out-
of-range values.
4. Result verification and documentation:
◦ Verify the results according to standardized QC guidelines.
◦ Record results in LIS and ensure technologist initials and
date are included.
◦ Notify the supervisor of any QC failures or significant
discrepancies.
B) Leukocyte Analysis (Urinalysis)
1. Specimen preparation:
◦ Ensure the urine specimen is at room temperature.
◦ Perform a gentle mix to suspend leukocytes.
2. Reagent strip testing:
◦ Completely immerse the Siemens Multistix reagent strip into
the urine and remove immediately.
◦ Drag the edge of the strip along the container rim to remove
excess urine.
◦ Start the timer as indicated by the strip instructions.
3. Result reading:
◦ Read each pad at the time shown on the label, starting with
the shortest time.
◦ Match the test pad colors to the corresponding color block
on the label for leukocytes.
4. Result verification and documentation:
◦ Include color interpretation and comments (e.g., "No result
due to interference") when necessary.
◦ Record results in LIS with technologist initials and date.
◦ Notify the supervisor if results indicate positive for blood,
nitrite, protein, or if microscopy is required.
5. QUALITY CONTROL Internal QC:
◦ Run QC material with each new batch of reagent strips and
record results.
◦ For beta-glucuronidase analysis, ensure bi-weekly
comparisons between analyzers.
◦ Monthly analyzer correlation checks with instrument
printouts documented.
QC Failures:
• Repeat the analysis or perform cross-analyzer comparisons as
required.
• Report critical results immediately following established
guidelines.
1. REPORTING RESULTS Results are automatically transmitted
to LIS and must be reviewed and verified by the designated
technologist. Critical results:
• Any critical findings should be communicated immediately to the
requesting physician.
• Follow up on repeat critical values per established protocol.

This protocol is intended for use by trained personnel in CLIA-
certified laboratories and is based on current best practices as of
October 2023. Any deviations or issues should be reported to the
laboratory supervisor immediately for further review and resolution.
