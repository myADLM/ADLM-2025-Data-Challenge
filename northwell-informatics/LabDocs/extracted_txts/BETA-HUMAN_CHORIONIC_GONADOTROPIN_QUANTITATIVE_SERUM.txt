Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Beta-Human Chorionic
Gonadotropin (β-hCG) Quantitative, Serum
1. PURPOSE
To provide a detailed and standardized protocol for performing the
quantitative measurement of beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (β-
hCG) levels in serum samples. The accurate and precise
measurement is crucial for the diagnosis and monitoring of
pregnancy, ectopic pregnancy, trophoblastic disease, and certain
cancers.
Responsibility:
All qualified laboratory personnel are responsible for following this
SOP to ensure accurate and timely results. Any discrepancies or
issues encountered during the procedure must be reported to the
designated supervisor.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all serum samples submitted to the laboratory for
β-hCG quantitative analysis.
3. SPECIMEN
Preferred/Acceptable:
• 5 mL of serum collected in a red-top or gold-top (serum separator)
tube.
Unacceptable:
• Specimens that are hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric to a degree that
may interfere with the assay.
• Specimens with inadequate volume.
• Incorrectly labeled specimens.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Automated immunoassay analyzer (e.g., Roche Cobas, Siemens
ADVIA Centaur, etc.)
• Calibrators and controls specific to the β-hCG assay
• Serum separator tubes (gold-top) or red-top tubes
• Pipettes and disposable tips
• Laboratory timer
• 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes (if required for aliquoting)
• Quality control materials (both low and high level)
5. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation and Calibration:
1. Verify the expiry date and lot number of all reagents,
calibrators, and controls to ensure they are within acceptable
validity.
2. Prepare the analyzer according to the manufacturer’s
instructions, including performing system initialization and
verifying that all necessary reagents are loaded onto the
instrument.
3. Run calibrators and quality controls as required by the
manufacturer’s instructions and laboratory guidelines. Ensure
that calibration curves are within acceptable limits before
proceeding with sample analysis.
B) Sample Handling:
1. Upon specimen reception, visually inspect each sample for
hemolysis, lipemia, and icterus. Reject any unsuitable samples
according to the criteria described in section 3.
2. Centrifuge serum separator tubes at 2,000-3,000 RPM for
10-15 minutes to separate serum from cellular components.
3. Carefully pipette off the serum into labeled aliquot tubes if not
performing the assay immediately.
4. Store serum samples at 2-8°C if the analysis cannot be
performed on the same day. For longer storage, freeze samples
at -20°C or lower.
C) Assay Procedure:
1. Consult the manufacturer's instructions for the specific
immunoassay analyzer in use and follow the protocol for β-hCG
quantitation.
2. Load the serum samples onto the analyzer as per the sample
requirements specified.
3. Input the sample identification numbers and ensure they match
with the laboratory requisition form.
4. Start the run and monitor the progress of the assay. Verify that
the instrument operates within established quality control
parameters throughout the analytical run.
D) Quality Control:
1. Run low and high-level quality controls at the beginning of each
analytic run, after every 30 patient samples, and when a new
reagent lot is implemented.
2. Review quality control results to ensure they meet the
acceptable criteria before proceeding.
3. Document control results and any corrective actions taken in
the Quality Control Log.
E) Reporting Results:
1. Verify that the analyzer has correctly processed all samples and
that no errors have occurred during the run.
2. Review the quantitative β-hCG values generated by the
analyzer. Ensure results fall within the reportable range and
follow up on any flagged or outlying results.
3. Report results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
according to established procedures. Include any appropriate
comments or interpretative data as required.
4. Notify the requesting physician of any critical values following
standard laboratory protocols for critical results communication.
6. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the manufacturer’s insert for the specific immunoassay kit to
understand the limitations, such as potential interferences, cross-
reactivity, and the analytical measurement range of the assay.

8. DOCUMENTATION
All data, including calibrator and control results, patient results, and
any corrective actions taken, must be documented in the laboratory's
records. This documentation will ensure the traceability and reliability
of test results.
Note: Always keep this SOP updated with the latest guidelines and
manufacturer instructions. This protocol is specific to established
laboratory practices and equipment used. Adjustments may be
required based on variations in instrumentation and institutional
policies.
