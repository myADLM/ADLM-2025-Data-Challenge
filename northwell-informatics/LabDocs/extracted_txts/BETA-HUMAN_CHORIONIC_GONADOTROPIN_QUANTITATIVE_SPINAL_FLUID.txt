STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP) For BETA-HUMAN
CHORIONIC GONADOTROPIN, QUANTITATIVE, SPINAL FLUID
1. PURPOSE
To provide standardized and reliable methods for the analytical phase
of generating quantitative results for β-Human Chorionic
Gonadotropin (β-hCG) in spinal fluid.
RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for adhering to the
procedure and ensuring accurate and reliable test results.
Supervisors must ensure personnel are adequately trained and
adhere to this SOP.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred Specimen: Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) obtained via
lumbar puncture.
◦ Volume: A minimum of 1 mL of CSF.
◦ Container: Sterile, leak-proof container free of preservatives.
• Unacceptable Specimen:
◦ Specimens that have been contaminated or compromised.
◦ Specimens not in the appropriate container.
◦ Specimens with visible hemolysis or xanthochromia.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Equipment:
◦ Calibrated Immunoassay Analyzer (e.g., Roche cobas e 411,
Siemens ADVIA Centaur).
◦ Micropipettes and tips.
◦ Vortex mixer.
◦ Centrifuge.
• Reagents:
◦ β-hCG reagent kit specific for the analyzer.
◦ Control and calibration materials.
• Supplies:
◦ Sterile sample cups.
◦ Personal protective equipment (PPE).
4. PROCEDURE A. Preparation:
1. Use PPE including lab coat, gloves, and eye protection.
2. Verify and document the calibration status of the immunoassay
analyzer.
3. Check and ensure all reagent kits are within their expiration
dates and have been stored properly.
B. Sample Preparation:
1. Label all sample cups with the patient's identification and
accession number.
2. Mix the CSF sample gently by inversion, ensuring no bubbles
are formed.
3. If particulates are present, centrifuge the sample at 2000 - 3000
RPM for 10 minutes. Transfer the supernatant to a sterile
sample cup.
C. Assay Procedure:
1. Pipette the required quantity of CSF into a sample cup as
specified by the reagent kit instructions (e.g., 200 µL).
2. Load the samples, calibrators, and controls into the designated
positions on the immunoassay analyzer.
3. Follow the analyzer-specific protocol for running the β-hCG
assay.
4. Ensure the analyzer runs the assay and reports the results as
per defined procedure.
D. Quality Control:
1. Run quality control materials (negative and positive controls)
with each batch of samples.
2. Validate the results only if the quality control results fall within
the acceptable range.
3. Investigate and troubleshoot any quality control failures
according to the analyzer’s guidelines.
5. REPORTING RESULTS:
1. Verify the analyzer-generated results in the Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
2. Compare patient results to reference intervals and flag any
abnormal results.
3. Report critical values immediately to the requesting physician or
clinical team as per the laboratory’s critical result policy.
6. REFERENCE INTERVALS:
• β-hCG: Typically < 2 IU/L in non-pregnant individuals. Individual
laboratory reference ranges may vary; refer to laboratory-specific
reference intervals.
7. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
• High levels of hemolysis, lipemia, or icterus can interfere with the
assay.
• Samples containing interfering substances such as certain
pharmaceuticals should be interpreted with caution.
8. REFERENCES:
• Roche Diagnostics Elecsys β-hCG package insert.
• Siemens Healthineers ADVIA Centaur β-hCG package insert.
9. QUALITY ASSURANCE:
• Participate in inter-laboratory comparison programs quarterly.
• Perform internal audits of β-hCG testing at least annually to
ensure procedure adherence.
