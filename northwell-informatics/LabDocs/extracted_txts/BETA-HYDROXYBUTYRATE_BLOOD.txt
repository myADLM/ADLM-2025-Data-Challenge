SOP for Analytical Phase of Beta-Hydroxybutyrate (BHB), Blood
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to provide a standardized method
for the analysis and interpretation of Beta-Hydroxybutyrate (BHB) in
blood samples. This ensures consistent and accurate results for
clinical diagnosis and monitoring of patients.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of all technologists to adhere to the following
procedures for the analysis of Beta-Hydroxybutyrate, document all
necessary information accurately, and take appropriate measures for
quality control.
1. DEFINITION
Beta-Hydroxybutyrate (BHB) is one of the primary ketone bodies
produced in the body during ketosis. It is commonly measured in
patients with suspected ketoacidosis, uncontrolled diabetes, or during
prolonged fasting.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND HANDLING
Specimen Type:
• Preferred: Serum collected in a clot activator tube (red or gold
top)
• Acceptable: Plasma collected in a heparinized tube (green top)
Specimen Collection:
• Collect blood specimen using standard venipuncture techniques.
• Ensure proper labeling of the specimen with the patient's
identification, date, and time of collection.
Specimen Stability:
• Serum: Stable for up to 72 hours at 2-8°C. If testing will be
delayed beyond 72 hours, freeze at ≤ -20°C.
• Plasma: Stable for up to 72 hours at 2-8°C. If testing will be
delayed beyond 24 hours, freeze at ≤ -20°C.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed specimens
• Specimens stored at room temperature for more than 12 hours
• Specimens that are not properly labeled
Specimen Transport:
• Transport specimens to the laboratory as soon as possible.
• If transport time exceeds 30 minutes, keep the sample
refrigerated.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Automated chemistry analyzer capable of BHB measurement
(e.g., Beckman Coulter AU series, Roche Cobas c systems)
• Calibrated pipettes
• Centrifuge
Reagents:
• Commercially available Beta-Hydroxybutyrate reagent kit
• Calibrators and controls specific to the reagent kit
• Quality Control materials at two different levels (normal and
pathological)
Supplies:
• Clot activator tubes (red or gold top) or heparinized tubes (green
top)
• Sample cups or tubes for the chemistry analyzer
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
1. PROCEDURE
Sample Preparation:
• Centrifuge the blood specimen at 1500g for 10 minutes to
separate serum or plasma.
• Transfer the supernatant to a clean, labeled sample cup for
analysis.
Calibration and Quality Control:
• Perform calibration of the chemistry analyzer using the provided
calibrators according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
• Analyze quality control materials at the beginning of each shift,
after calibration, and as needed to verify the accuracy and
precision of the analyzer. Record all QC results.
Analysis:
1. Load the prepared serum or plasma sample into the
appropriate sample cup or insert.
2. Place the sample into the designated position on the chemistry
analyzer.
3. Select the test for Beta-Hydroxybutyrate on the analyzer’s
software and start the run.
4. The analyzer will automatically measure the BHB concentration
and generate results.
5. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
Reference Intervals:
• Normal fasting: <0.4 mmol/L
• Ketosis: 0.5-3.0 mmol/L
• Ketoacidosis: >3.0 mmol/L
Critical Values:
• Any result >3.0 mmol/L should be immediately reported to the
requesting physician or healthcare provider.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Review and verify all results before reporting.
• Document any comments or flags associated with the results in
the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• If any discrepancies or issues are noted, perform troubleshooting
steps and reanalyze the sample if necessary.
1. QUALITY CONTROL AND TROUBLESHOOTING
• Document all calibration and quality control results.
• If QC results are outside acceptable limits, do not report patient
results. Investigate the cause and take corrective actions, such as
recalibrating or maintenance of the instrument.
• Refer to the analyzer’s manual and reagent kit inserts for specific
troubleshooting steps.
