Title: Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analysis of Beta-
Hydroxybutyrate, Serum
1. PURPOSE
To establish a standardized procedure for the accurate and precise
measurement of Beta-Hydroxybutyrate (BHB) levels in serum using
an enzymatic colorimetric method. This analysis is important for the
diagnosis and monitoring of ketoacidosis.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory personnel to
perform and document the analysis in accordance with this SOP. It is
also the responsibility of the staff to identify any issues that may
affect test results and report them to the supervisor.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred Specimen:
• Serum collected in red-top tubes or serum separator tubes (SST).
Specimen Collection and Handling:
• Allow the blood to clot in the serum tube, then centrifuge to
separate the serum from blood cells.
• Transfer the serum into a clean, labelled container.
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples may interfere with the
assay and should be avoided when possible.
• Sample storage: Stable for up to 7 days at 2-8°C. For long-term
storage, keep at -20°C. Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens with severe hemolysis, gross contamination, or
improperly labeled tubes.
• Specimens in collection tubes with anticoagulants such as EDTA,
sodium heparin, or lithium heparin.
1. REAGENTS AND EQUIPMENT
Reagents:
• Enzymatic Beta-Hydroxybutyrate assay kit (Refer to the
manufacturer's insert for detailed reagent preparation and stability
information).
Equipment:
• Spectrophotometer capable of reading at 340 nm
• Calibrated pipettes and tips
• Centrifuge
• Water bath or incubator set at 37°C
• Calibration standards and quality control materials
1. PROCEDURE
4.1 Calibration and Quality Control:
• Perform calibration using the provided calibration standards prior
to running patient samples. Follow the manufacturer’s calibration
protocol.
• Run quality control (QC) samples at two different levels (high and
low) along with patient samples each day the test is performed.
QC results must fall within the acceptable range specified in the
kit insert. If QC results are not within the acceptable range,
troubleshoot according to the manufacturer's recommendations
and do not report patient results until QC passes.
4.2 Sample Preparation and Analysis:
1. Label all necessary tubes for standards, controls, and patient
specimens.
2. Prepare the working reagent according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
3. Pipette the required volume of standards, controls, and serum
samples into their respective labeled test tubes.
4. Add the working reagent to each tube as specified in the kit
insert. Mix thoroughly.
5. Incubate the tubes at 37°C for the time specified in the kit
insert.
6. Measure the absorbance of each reaction mixture at 340 nm
using the spectrophotometer.
7. Record the absorbance readings.
(Note: Detailed instructions specific to the enzymatic kit being used
should be followed closely, including any timing and mixing steps.)
1. CALCULATION OF RESULTS
• Calculate the BHB concentration in the patient samples using the
standard curve generated from the absorbance readings of the
calibration standards.
• Use the formula or method provided in the kit insert to translate
absorbance readings into concentration values (typically
expressed in mmol/L).
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Enter the calculated BHB concentrations into the Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
• All results must be reviewed and verified by the technologist
before they are released.
• Critical values must be communicated to the appropriate
healthcare provider immediately, and proper documentation of this
notification must be made.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run and document internal and external quality control samples
on a regular basis (e.g., daily, weekly) in accordance with the
laboratory's quality assurance program.
• Review QC results to ensure that the assay performance meets
established criteria. If QC results fall outside acceptable limits,
identify the source of error, correct it, and re-run both the QC
samples and patient samples affected by the error.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's package insert and instructional manual for the
BHB Enzymatic Assay Kit.
• Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines for
blood gas and pH analysis.
1. SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS
• Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE)
including lab coat, gloves, and eye protection.
• Follow institutional biohazard and chemical safety protocols.
• Handle and dispose of all clinical specimens, assay reagents, and
waste materials in accordance with proper biohazard and
chemical waste disposal procedures.
1. DOCUMENTATION
• Maintain documentation for each specimen processed, including
patient identification, test performed, and the technologist's
initials.
• Document all calibrations, QC results, maintenance logs, and any
troubleshooting or corrective actions taken.
By adhering to this SOP, the laboratory ensures the generation of
accurate and reliable results for serum Beta-Hydroxybutyrate,
contributing to effective patient care and management.
