Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for BETA-
LACTOGLOBULIN, IGE, SERUM Analysis
1. PURPOSE
To provide step-by-step instructions for the precise and
accurate determination of Beta-Lactoglobulin IgE concentration
in serum samples.
RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory personnel to
perform and document the Beta-Lactoglobulin IgE test according to
this SOP, ensuring all the quality control and procedural guidelines
are adhered to.
1. DEFINITION
Beta-Lactoglobulin IgE is a test conducted to quantify the
specific IgE antibodies present in the serum against the beta-
lactoglobulin protein, commonly used to identify allergic
responses to cow's milk proteins.
2. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• ELISA reader capable of reading absorbance at 450 nm
• Reagents and kit components as supplied by the manufacturer
(be sure to check the expiration dates and kit integrity before use)
• Microcentrifuge (if needed)
• Micropipettes and tips
• Microtiter plate washer (optional)
• Vortex mixer
• Disposable gloves and lab coat
• Beta-Lactoglobulin IgE ELISA Kit
• Deionized or distilled water
1. PROCEDURE
Sample Preparation:
1. Confirm that the serum samples have been properly collected,
received, and accessioned.
2. Allow the refrigerated serum samples to come to room
temperature before analysis.
3. Mix the sample thoroughly using a vortex mixer if necessary.
Assay Procedure:
1. Preparation of Reagents:
◦ Prepare all reagents as specified in the ELISA kit
instructions.
◦ Bring all reagents and samples to room temperature before
use.
◦ Reconstitute any lyophilized materials as per the
manufacturer’s guidelines.
2. Plate Setup:
◦ Securely place the microtiter plate on a stable surface.
◦ Plan and document the placement of samples, standards,
and controls on the plate.
3. Addition of Standards and Samples:
◦ Pipette the appropriate volume of standards into designated
wells.
◦ Add the specified volume of each serum sample to the
respective wells.
◦ Add assay buffer to blank wells as per the kit instructions.
4. Addition of Conjugation Reagent:
◦ Add the prepared enzyme-antibody conjugate to each well.
◦ Gently tap the plate to ensure the complete mixing of
contents.
5. Incubation:
◦ Cover the plate with a sealing film or lid.
◦ Incubate the plate at the recommended temperature and
duration per kit instructions (e.g., 37°C for 1 hour).
6. Washing:
◦ After the incubation period, wash the wells 3-5 times using a
plate washer or manually with the washing buffer.
◦ Ensure thorough removal of residual liquid by tapping the
inverted plate on absorbent paper.
7. Substrate Reaction:
◦ Add the TMB substrate solution to each well.
◦ Incubate the plate in the dark at room temperature for the
period specified in the kit instructions (e.g., 10 minutes).
8. Stopping the Reaction:
◦ Add the stop solution to each well to halt the reaction.
◦ The color will change from blue to yellow.
9. Reading the Plate:
◦ Read the absorbance of each well at 450 nm using an
ELISA reader within 30 minutes of adding the stop solution.
10. Calculating Results:
◦ Plot the standard curve by plotting the absorbance of
standard solutions against their respective concentrations.
◦ Determine the concentration of Beta-Lactoglobulin IgE in the
serum samples from the standard curve.
11. QUALITY CONTROL:
Internal Quality Control:
• Include both high and low-positive control sera in each assay to
validate the performance of the assay.
• Results should be within the expected range as defined by the
laboratory.
• Use internal quality control materials, logging QC data
appropriately.
External Quality Control:
• Participate in proficiency testing schemes where available to
ensure inter-laboratory consistency.
1. REPORTING RESULTS:
• Results should be entered into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS) for review.
• The reporting format should include the concentration of Beta-
Lactoglobulin IgE and interpretive comments based on reference
intervals:
Reference intervals:
◦ Negative: <0.35 kU/L
◦ Borderline: 0.35-0.70 kU/L
◦ Positive: >0.70 kU/L
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS:
• Laboratory-determined reference ranges should be clearly
defined based on the population being assessed and
standardized guidelines.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
• The results should be interpreted within the context of the clinical
findings.
• Cross-reactivity with other proteins and other technical factors can
affect the accuracy of the results.
1. DOCUMENTATION/RECORD KEEPING:
• Ensure all the results and Quality Control data are documented
accurately in a logbook or electronically as per laboratory
protocol.
• Maintain records of reagent lot numbers and expiration dates
used in testing.
