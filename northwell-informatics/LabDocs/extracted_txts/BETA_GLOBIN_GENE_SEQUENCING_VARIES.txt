STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP)
1. PURPOSE
To provide a detailed procedure for the analysis and reporting of Beta
Globin Gene Sequencing using the PCR method, covering the
processes from the preparation of samples to the final interpretation
and generation of results.
Responsibility:
• All designated personnel conducting Beta Globin Gene
Sequencing must adhere strictly to this procedure.
• The supervisor must ensure compliance, regularly review the
process, and handle any aberrations.
1. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all Beta Globin Gene Sequencing tests
performed in the molecular diagnostics laboratory.
1. DEFINITION
Beta Globin Gene Sequencing is a method used to identify mutations
in the HBB gene responsible for β-thalassemia and other
hemoglobinopathies.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Automated DNA sequencer
• PCR thermal cycler
• DNA extraction kits
• Reagents and chemicals for PCR and sequencing
• Pipettes and related consumables (tips, tubes, etc.)
• Thermal cycler plates
• Centrifuges
• NCBI/Ensembl genome databases
1. PROCEDURE
Procedure for Beta Globin Gene Sequencing:
A) DNA Extraction:
1. Ensure that the sample is received, verified, and accessioned
properly.
2. Extract genomic DNA from whole blood using the DNA
extraction kit following the manufacturer's instructions.
3. Quantify and assess the purity of the extracted DNA using a
spectrophotometer.
4. Document the DNA concentration and purity on the DNA
extraction log.
B) PCR Amplification:
1. Prepare the PCR master mix according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
2. Add an appropriate amount of DNA template to the PCR mix.
3. Perform the PCR with the following cycling parameters for Beta
Globin Gene amplification:
◦ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 5 minutes
◦ 35 cycles of:
▪ Denaturation: 95°C for 30 seconds
▪ Annealing: 55–60°C for 30 seconds (adjusted based on
the primer specificity)
▪ Extension: 72°C for 1 minute
◦ Final extension: 72°C for 10 minutes
◦ Hold at 4°C until further processing
4. Confirm the presence of amplified product by running an aliquot
on an agarose gel and visualizing under UV light after ethidium
bromide or SYBR Safe staining.
C) Preparation for Sequencing:
1. Purify the PCR product to remove unincorporated primers and
dNTPs using a PCR cleanup kit, following the manufacturer's
protocol.
2. Quantify the purified PCR product to ensure appropriate
concentration for sequencing.
3. Prepare sequencing reactions using cycle sequencing
chemistry according to the manufacturer's instructions.
4. Purify sequencing reactions to remove excess dye terminators
using a sequencing purification kit.
D) Sequencing:
1. Load the purified sequencing reaction into the automated DNA
sequencer.
2. Perform sequencing as per the instrument's protocol.
3. Save and back up raw sequence data from the sequencer to a
secure data storage.
E) Data Analysis:
1. Analyze the sequenced data using bioinformatics software
designed for mutation detection in the Beta Globin gene.
2. Compare the patient's sequence to the reference sequence to
identify mutations.
3. Document identified mutations and validate with a second
technologist if discrepancies arise.
F) Quality Control:
1. Include positive and negative control samples in each run to
ensure the validity of results.
2. Repeat sequencing if control samples do not give expected
results.
3. Record all quality control results and actions taken in the
appropriate log.
G) Validation and Reporting:
1. Validate the identified variants using a second independent
method, such as Sanger sequencing or another reliable
molecular technique.
2. Review the results and interpret the clinical significance of
identified mutations using established guidelines and reference
databases (NCBI, Ensembl).
3. Prepare and sign the final report that highlights identified
mutations, their clinical significance, and recommendations.
4. Document and securely store all procedural records and patient
data files.
5. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results must be documented on the laboratory information
system (LIS).
• Each report must pass through a review and verification process
by a qualified molecular pathologist before being released.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Refer to databases like NCBI, Ensembl, and ClinVar for variant
interpretation guidelines and normal reference intervals. Variant
classification (benign, likely benign, VUS, likely pathogenic,
pathogenic) should be made adhering to ACMG/AMP guidelines.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• DNA quality and quantity can impact amplification and sequencing
outcomes.
• Known polymorphisms or homologous sequences can potentially
interfere with specific primer binding.
• Low-level mosaicism may not be detected.
