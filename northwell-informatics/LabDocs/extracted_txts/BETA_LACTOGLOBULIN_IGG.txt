Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase for Generating Results for Beta Lactoglobulin
IgG
Prepared by: [Your Name]
Date: [Current Date]
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the analytical procedures for
generating results for Beta Lactoglobulin IgG. The SOP includes
preparation, assay execution, quality control, and reporting results in
accordance with the analytical phase standards of a CLIA-certified
laboratory.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel involved in the
analytical phase of testing for Beta Lactoglobulin IgG.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for following the
procedures outlined in this SOP to ensure accurate and reliable
results for Beta Lactoglobulin IgG. The supervisor is responsible for
overseeing the procedure and addressing any issues or
discrepancies.
4. DEFINITIONS
Beta Lactoglobulin IgG: An immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody specific
to beta lactoglobulin, a major whey protein.
5. PROCEDURE
5.1. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies
• ELISA Reader
• Microplate Washer
• Pipettes and tips
• Beta Lactoglobulin IgG ELISA kit
• Calibrators and controls
• Test tubes
• Disposable gloves
• Laboratory timer
5.2. Preparation
1. Verify that all reagents and supplies are within their expiration
dates.
2. Pre-warm reagents to room temperature (20-25°C) before use.
3. Ensure the ELISA reader and microplate washer are calibrated
and functioning properly.
5.3. Assay Execution
1. Specimen Preparation:
◦ Centrifuge patient samples at 3,000 RPM for 10 minutes to
obtain serum/plasma.
◦ Label test tubes accurately with patient identifiers.
2. ELISA Plate Preparation:
◦ Add appropriate volumes of calibrators, controls, and patient
samples to the ELISA wells as per the manufacturer's
instructions.
◦ Ensure proper mixing by gently tapping the plate.
3. Incubation and Washing:
◦ Incubate the plate as specified in the kit instructions at room
temperature.
◦ Wash the plate using the microplate washer, ensuring
complete removal of washing buffer between steps.
4. Addition of Conjugate and Substrate:
◦ Add the enzyme conjugate to each well and incubate for the
specified time.
◦ Add the substrate solution to each well and incubate in the
dark at room temperature.
5. Stop Reaction and Reading:
◦ Add the stop solution to each well to halt the reaction.
◦ Read the absorbance at the appropriate wavelength
(specified in the kit) using the ELISA reader.
5.4. Quality Control
1. Internal Quality Control:
◦ Run internal controls (positive and negative) with each batch
of tests.
◦ Ensure control results are within the acceptable range
specified by the manufacturer.
2. External Quality Control:
◦ Participate in external proficiency testing programs as
required by CLIA regulations.
◦ Review and document results from these programs for
quality assurance.
5.5. Reporting Results
1. Result Interpretation:
◦ Compare patient sample absorbance readings to the
calibration curve.
◦ Report results as Beta Lactoglobulin IgG concentration (IU/
mL or specified units).
2. Documentation:
◦ Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
for review and verification.
◦ Document any discrepancies or issues encountered and
communicate with the supervisor for resolution.
6. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the Beta Lactoglobulin IgG ELISA kit's product insert for
specific limitations regarding reagent shelf life, cross-reactivity, and
performance characteristics.
