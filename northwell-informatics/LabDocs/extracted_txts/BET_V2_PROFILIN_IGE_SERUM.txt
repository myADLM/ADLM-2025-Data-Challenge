Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for
Analytical Phase of BET V2 (PROFILIN),
IGE, SERUM Testing
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the procedures for the analytical phase of
determining BET V2 (Profilin) and serum IgE levels. The procedures
cover the preparation, testing, quality control, reporting results, and
troubleshooting measures necessary for producing reliable and
accurate results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing the
analytical testing as defined in this SOP. It is also their responsibility
to ensure proper test setup, execution, quality control, and result
documentation. Supervisors are tasked with providing oversight and
ensuring compliance with protocol documentation and corrective
actions when necessary.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• BET V2 (Profilin) assay kit
• Serum IgE assay kit
• Microplate reader (ELISA, Chemiluminescence, or Fluorescence-
based)
• Incubators
• Calibrators and standards
• Quality control materials (negative and positive controls)
• Laboratory reagents (buffers, washing solutions, diluents)
• Pipettes and tips
• Plate washer
• Centrifuge
• Computer with LIS interface
4. PROCEDURE
A) PREPARATION
1. Preparation of Serum Specimen:
◦ Ensure serum specimens are appropriately labeled and
accessioned.
◦ Centrifuge blood samples at 2,000-3,000 rpm for 10 minutes
to obtain serum.
◦ Store serum specimens at 2-8°C for up to 72 hours or
freeze at -20°C for longer storage.
2. Preparation of Reagents:
◦ Prepare reagents according to manufacturer’s instructions in
the assay kits.
◦ Bring all reagents to room temperature prior to use.
◦ Follow reconstitution procedures for standards, calibrators,
and quality control materials as outlined in the kit insert.
B) TEST SETUP
1. Microplate Setup:
◦ Arrange wells of the microplate for calibrators, controls, and
patient samples.
◦ Include the necessary blank wells for instrument calibration.
◦ Prepare and load specimens, calibrators, and controls
according to kit instructions.
2. Assay Execution:
◦ Add the specified amount of sample, calibrator, control, or
reagent to each well.
◦ Follow the timing and procedural steps (e.g., incubation,
washing cycles) exactly as stated in the assay protocol.
◦ Utilize the automatic plate washer to ensure consistent
washing steps.
◦ Maintain appropriate environmental conditions as specified
(e.g., temperature control in incubators).
C) SIGNAL DETECTION
1. Microplate Reader Operation:
◦ Insert the microplate into the reader.
◦ Run the detection process (ELISA, Chemiluminescence,
Fluorescence) as per the kit instructions.
◦ Ensure instrument settings match the requirements of the
assay (e.g., wavelengths, reading time).
D) QUALITY CONTROL
1. Quality Control Analysis:
◦ Perform QC analysis using designated control materials with
each batch of assays.
◦ Record values in the QC log and compare them against
acceptable ranges.
◦ If QC results fall outside of acceptable limits, troubleshoot
according to the manufacturer’s guidelines, and re-run the
samples if necessary.
E) REPORTING RESULTS
1. Data Entry and Verification:
◦ Review test results in the LIS interface.
◦ Verify and validate data entry accurately.
◦ Report critical results immediately to the attending physician
and provide proper documentation.
2. Documentation Requirements:
◦ Document all steps undertaken in the testing procedure.
◦ Include notes on any issues faced and corrective actions
applied.
◦ Store printouts and electronic records as per laboratory
policy for traceability.
5. TROUBLESHOOTING
Common Issues and Their Resolutions:
1. Erratic Readings in Microplate Reader:
◦ Ensure calibration settings are correct.
◦ Check for any bubbles or particulate matter affecting the
readings.
◦ Re-run the assay if necessary.
2. QC Failure:
◦ Verify reagent preparation.
◦ Check instrument settings and environmental conditions.
◦ Re-run the control materials, and if persistent issues are
noted, consult the supervisor.
