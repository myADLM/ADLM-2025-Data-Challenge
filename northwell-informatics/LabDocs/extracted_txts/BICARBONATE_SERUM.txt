Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase:
Bicarbonate, Serum
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the analytical procedure for
measuring bicarbonate (HCO3-) in serum specimens, ensuring
accurate and reliable results. This will guide laboratory personnel
through specimen handling, preparation, analysis, quality control, and
reporting.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of designated laboratory personnel to perform
and document all steps of the procedure according to this SOP. It is
also the responsibility of laboratory supervisors to ensure compliance
with the procedure, including corrective actions if necessary.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred Specimen:
• Serum collected in a red-top tube (without anticoagulant) or
serum separator tube (SST).
• Ensure that the serum is separated from cells within 2 hours of
collection.
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Specimens collected in tubes containing anticoagulants such as
EDTA, sodium citrate, or heparin.
• Specimens with significant hemolysis or lipemia.
• Specimens that are not properly labeled or have missing
collection date/time.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Automated chemistry analyzer (e.g., Roche, Siemens)
• Calibrators and control materials.
• Serum separator tubes (SST) or red-top tubes.
• Pipettes and tips.
• Gloves and safety equipment.
1. PROCEDURE
5.1 Specimen Preparation:
• Allow the blood to clot at room temperature for 30 minutes.
• Centrifuge the blood at 1500-2000 x g for 10 minutes to separate
serum.
• Transfer the serum to a clean, appropriately labeled container
promptly.
• Store separated serum at 2-8°C if analysis is not performed
immediately.
5.2 Instrument Preparation:
• Follow the instrument manufacturer's guidelines for daily setup
and calibration.
• Ensure that the analyzer is properly calibrated using
manufacturer-provided or traceable calibrators.
• Perform daily maintenance checks and record any deviations or
issues.
5.3 Analysis:
• Load the serum specimen into the chemistry analyzer according
to the instrument instructions.
• Program the analyzer to run the bicarbonate assay.
• Start the analysis and monitor the instrument for any alarms or
error messages.
• Verify that the quality control results are within acceptable limits
before accepting patient results.
5.4 Quality Control:
• Run internal quality control specimens at the start of each shift,
after calibration, and whenever the results appear suspect.
• Use two levels of control material (normal and abnormal) for each
batch of patient specimens.
• Document all control results and take corrective actions if a
control result is outside acceptable limits.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
6.1 Verification:
• Review the analyzer printout for completeness, accuracy, and any
flagged results.
• Verify patient results against quality control data and instrument
calibration status.
• If any result is questionable, repeat the analysis using a fresh
aliquot of the specimen.
6.2 Documentation:
• Record the results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Annotate any corrective actions taken or deviations encountered
during analysis.
• Document critical results according to laboratory policy.
6.3 Reference Intervals:
• Standard reference interval for serum bicarbonate is typically
22-29 mmol/L.
• Individual laboratory reference intervals may vary; refer to site-
specific guidelines.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolysis, lipemia, or improper specimen handling can adversely
affect the accuracy of bicarbonate measurements.
• Ensure that specimens are correctly processed and stored to
minimize pre-analytical errors.
1. REFERENCES
• Instrument-specific operator’s manual.
• Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines.
• Relevant scientific literature on bicarbonate assay performance
and limitations.
This SOP must be reviewed annually to ensure accuracy and
adherence to current best practices and regulatory requirements. Any
changes to the procedure must be documented and communicated
to all laboratory personnel promptly.
