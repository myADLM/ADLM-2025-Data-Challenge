Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Determination of
Bicarbonate in Urine – Analytical Phase
1. PURPOSE
To ensure the accurate and precise determination of bicarbonate
(HCO3-) levels in urine specimens by following standardized
laboratory procedures. Proper handling, processing, and
documentation will ensure reliable results.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of designated laboratory personnel to follow this
SOP accurately and consistently, ensure all reagents and equipment
are within their performance specifications, and report any procedural
anomalies to the supervisor or laboratory manager.
2. SPECIMEN
• Preferred/Acceptable:
◦ 10 mL freshly voided urine, sent to the laboratory within 2
hours of collection. The patient should be instructed to collect
a midstream sample.
◦ The specimen can be collected in a sterile, plastic urine
container without preservatives or in a container with an
appropriate urine preservative as recommended by the
reagent manufacturer.
• Unacceptable:
◦ Specimens that are not properly labeled.
◦ Specimens received more than 2 hours after collection that
have not been preserved.
◦ Specimens with visible contamination or signs of degradation.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Urine Bicarbonate Reagent Kit (follow manufacturer’s
recommendations)
• Calibration standards
• Quality control materials (normal and abnormal levels)
• pH meter or automated analyzer capable of measuring
bicarbonate
• Calibrated pipettes
• Test tubes and rack for sample processing
• Centrifuge
• Timer
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
• Laboratory Information System (LIS)
4. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation:
1. Receipt and Accession:
◦ Confirm urine sample received meets acceptance criteria.
◦ Record receipt in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
2. Initial Handling:
◦ Visually inspect the sample for volume and any signs of
contamination.
◦ Mix the urine sample by gentle inversion.
3. Centrifugation:
◦ Centrifuge the urine sample at 1500 RPM for 5 minutes to
remove any particulate matter if necessary.
◦ Decant the supernatant into a clean test tube for analysis.
B. Equipment Calibration:
1. Calibrate the pH meter or automated analyzer according to
the manufacturer’s instructions:
◦ Use calibration standards specific for bicarbonate
determination.
◦ Document calibration results in the calibration log.
C. Quality Control:
1. Prepare and run quality control materials:
◦ Include both normal and abnormal control levels.
◦ Perform QC checks at the start of each run, after every
calibration, and when a new reagent lot is used.
◦ Document QC results in the QC log and verify that they fall
within acceptable ranges before proceeding to patient
samples.
D. Bicarbonate Assay:
1. Pipet the required volume of urine sample into the analyzer or
reaction vessel as per the reagent kit instructions.
2. Follow the reagent kit instructions for the addition of reagents,
incubation time, and procedure specifics.
3. Measure the bicarbonate concentration as specified by the pH
meter or automated analyzer.
4. Record readings in the LIS.
E. Data Analysis and Documentation:
1. Data Verification:
◦ Ensure all results are checked for accuracy and
completeness.
◦ Compare patient results with the quality control outcomes to
verify the validity of the run.
2. Troubleshooting:
◦ If QC results are outside acceptable ranges, identify and
rectify the problem before rerunning QC and patient
samples.
◦ Document all corrective actions in the laboratory logbook.
F. Reporting Results:
1. Result Verification:
◦ Verify results in the LIS, ensuring no transcription errors.
◦ Valid patient results are approved and transmitted to the
appropriate healthcare providers.
2. Critical Values:
◦ Notify responsible healthcare providers immediately if any
critical values are detected, following the laboratory's critical
result notification policy.
◦ Document notification in the patient's record accurately.
5. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Typical reference interval for urine bicarbonate:
◦ 0 - 15 mmol/L
(Note: Always refer to manufacturer guidelines for specific
intervals applicable to the reagents and equipment used.)
6. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to the reagent kit insert for any specific limitations of the
assay.
• Ensure that any interfering substances are identified and
protocols to mitigate their effects are followed.
7. REFERENCES:
• Manufacturer Instructions for Use (IFU) for the Urine Bicarbonate
Reagent Kit.
• Laboratory Procedure Manuals.
• Relevant literature on urine bicarbonate determination techniques
and best practices.
8. REVISION HISTORY:
• Document all changes and updates to the SOP in this section,
along with the date of implementation.
