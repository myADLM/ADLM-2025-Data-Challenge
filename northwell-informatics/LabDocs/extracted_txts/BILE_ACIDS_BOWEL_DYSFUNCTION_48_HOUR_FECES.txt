SOP: Analytical Phase of Generating Results for Bile Acids, Bowel
Dysfunction, 48 Hour, Feces
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedure for analyzing and
generating results for Bile Acids in fecal samples related to bowel
dysfunction which have been collected over a 48-hour period. This
procedure is aimed at ensuring consistent and accurate test results
which are crucial for diagnostic and monitoring purposes.
Responsibility:
• It is the responsibility of designated laboratory staff to conduct the
analyses as outlined in this procedure.
• All staff must ensure adherence to quality control measures and
timely reporting of results.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen:
• Collection: Fecal samples should be collected over a continuous
48-hour period in containers provided by the laboratory.
• Storage: Specimens should be stored at 2-8°C during the
collection period and transported to the laboratory immediately
upon completion.
• Unacceptable Specimens: Any specimens not collected in the
required containers, not stored properly, or beyond 48-hour
collection window will be rejected.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Required Equipment:
• Centrifuge
• High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system or an
appropriate analyzer for bile acids determination
• Analytical balance
• Pipettes and tips
• Vortex mixer
Reagents and Supplies:
• Bile Acid Standards
• Solvents and Reagents specific to the HPLC method used
• Fecal sample preparation kits
• Quality control materials: Known bile acids standards for QC
validation
• Collection containers for 48-hour fecal specimen collection
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform quality control checks using known bile acid standards
before sample analysis.
• Ensure calibration of HPLC system is in line with the
manufacturer’s instructions and laboratory protocol.
• Run internal quality control material along with patient specimens.
Two levels of QC materials should be analyzed with each batch.
• Document QC results and review to verify no critical values are
compromised.
1. PROCEDURE
Sample Preparation:
• Homogenize fecal samples thoroughly.
• Weigh a specific aliquot (e.g., 5g) into a clean container.
• Add appropriate volume of extraction solvent (e.g., methanol) and
vortex mix to ensure complete mixing.
• Centrifuge the samples at 3000 rpm for 10-15 minutes.
• Carefully transfer the supernatant to a clean tube, avoiding any
solid material.
Bile Acid Analysis:
• Set up the HPLC system or analyzer according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
• Load the prepared samples and standards on the system.
• Run the HPLC system according to method parameters
specifically developed for the bile acids analysis.
• Ensure that temperature, flow rate, and detection wavelength are
as per the validated method.
1. DATA ANALYSIS AND INTERPRETATION
• Chromatograms generated from the HPLC system should be
analyzed and integrated to determine the concentration of
individual bile acids in each sample.
• Results should be compared against the set standards to ensure
accuracy.
• Quality control results should be within the acceptable range; if
not, re-run the analysis of the affected samples.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• The bile acid concentrations calculated from the analysis should
be entered into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Verify the results and ensure accuracy before final validation.
• Report the final results to the requesting physician or clinical team
following site-specific reporting guidelines.
• For any critical values, follow the laboratory protocol for
immediate reporting to the healthcare provider.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions for the HPLC system.
• Standard laboratory protocols for sample preparation and
analysis.
• Relevant standard operating procedures for quality control
measures and documentation.
1. NOTES
• All deviations from the outlined procedure must be documented
and potential impacts on results noted.
• Ensure all waste generated from the procedure, especially
hazardous solvents, is disposed of in accordance with laboratory
safety protocols.
By following the outlined SOP, the laboratory ensures the reliable and
consistent analysis of bile acids in fecal samples contributing to
comprehensive diagnostic insights on bowel dysfunction.
