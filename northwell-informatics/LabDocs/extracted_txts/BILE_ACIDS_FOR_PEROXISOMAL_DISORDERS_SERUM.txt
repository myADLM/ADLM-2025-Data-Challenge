Standard Operating Procedure: BILE ACIDS FOR
PEROXISOMAL DISORDERS, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for the analytical phase of generating results
for bile acids for peroxisomal disorders in serum samples.
Responsibility:
Laboratory technologists are responsible for following this procedure
to ensure accurate and timely generation of results. Supervisors are
responsible for ensuring compliance with this procedure and
providing necessary training.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred Specimen:
• 2 mL serum collected in a red-top tube without additives.
Specimen Stability:
• Serum should be separated from the clot as soon as possible,
preferably within 2 hours of collection.
• Specimen stability: Refrigerate at 2-8°C and analyze within 24
hours. For long-term storage, freeze at -20°C or colder.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
• Specimens collected in tubes with additives (e.g., EDTA, heparin).
• Specimens that have been left at ambient temperature for more
than 2 hours before processing.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Centrifuge
• Refrigerated storage (2-8°C) or freezer (-20°C or colder)
• Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)
system
• Micropipettes and pipette tips
Reagents:
• Bile acids standard mixture (store according to manufacturer’s
specifications)
• Internal standard solution
• Mobile phase reagents (e.g., acetonitrile, water, formic acid)
• Calibrators and quality control materials
Supplies:
• Red-top serum tubes
• Pipette tips
• Sample vials
4. PROCEDURE
A) Sample Preparation:
1. Serum Separation:
◦ Centrifuge the collected blood sample at 1500 x g for 10
minutes at 4°C.
◦ Carefully transfer the supernatant (serum) into a clean,
appropriately labeled sample vial.
2. Storage:
◦ If analysis is not immediate, store the serum sample at
2-8°C for up to 24 hours. For longer storage, freeze at -20°C
or colder.
B) Analytical Procedure:
1. Instrument Setup:
◦ Start the LC-MS/MS system and verify all settings according
to the manufacturer's instructions.
◦ Prepare the mobile phases and ensure they are degassed
before use.
2. Calibration and Quality Control:
◦ Prepare calibrators and quality control samples as per
manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Run the calibration curve and quality control samples to
ensure the instrument's performance is within acceptable
limits.
3. Sample Analysis:
◦ Pipette 100 µL of serum sample into a sample vial.
◦ Add 50 µL of internal standard solution to each sample vial.
◦ Vortex the sample vials for 10 seconds to ensure thorough
mixing.
◦ Load the sample vials, calibrators, and quality control
samples onto the LC-MS/MS autosampler.
◦ Run the LC-MS/MS analysis according to the standard
operating protocol.
4. Data Analysis:
◦ Review chromatograms and ensure peaks are correctly
identified and integrated.
◦ Calculate bile acid concentrations using the calibration
curve.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
• Internal Quality Control (IQC):
◦ Analyze quality control samples alongside patient samples in
each run.
◦ Ensure IQC results fall within the established range before
validating patient results.
• External Quality Assurance (EQA):
◦ Participate in external proficiency testing programs as
available.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Compare the bile acid concentrations to reference intervals.
2. Record the results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
3. Review and verify results by the designated laboratory
technologist.
4. Report critical results following the laboratory’s critical result
reporting policy.
7. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the LC-MS/MS manufacturer’s insert and standard operating
guidelines for limitations related to sensitivity, specificity, and potential
sources of interference.
