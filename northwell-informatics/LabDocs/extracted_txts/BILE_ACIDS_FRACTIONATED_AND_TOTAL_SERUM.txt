Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical
Phase of Bile Acids, Fractionated and Total, Serum
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for analyzing and generating results for
fractionated and total bile acids in serum using validated methods to
ensure accurate, reliable, and reproducible results.
Responsibility:
• Trained laboratory technologists are responsible for performing
the analysis and generating the results for bile acids.
• Supervisors are responsible for reviewing and verifying the
results, addressing any issues encountered during the analytical
process, and ensuring the maintenance of equipment and quality
control.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS:
• Preferred specimen: Serum collected in a serum separator tube
(SST) or plain red-top tube.
• Volume: Minimum of 1 mL of serum.
• Stability: Serum specimens should be separated from cells within
2 hours of collection and stored at 2-8°C for up to 72 hours. For
longer storage, freeze at -20°C or lower.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES:
• High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) system or
Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) system.
• Calibration standards and quality control materials for bile acids.
• Reagents:
◦ Mobile phase solvents
◦ Buffers
◦ Internal standards for quantification
• Laboratory supplies:
◦ Microcentrifuge tubes
◦ Pipettes and pipette tips
◦ Vortex mixer
◦ Centrifuge
◦ Refrigerated storage
4. PROCEDURE:
A) PREPARATION OF CALIBRATION STANDARDS AND QUALITY
CONTROLS:
1. Prepare calibration standards by diluting the bile acids stock
solution to desired concentrations.
2. Prepare quality control samples covering the low, medium, and
high concentration ranges of the expected assay.
3. Store calibration standards and quality controls according to
manufacturer instructions.
B) SAMPLE PREPARATION:
1. Thaw frozen serum samples and calibrators/controls at room
temperature.
2. Centrifuge serum samples at 1500-2000 x g for 10 minutes to
remove particulate matter.
3. Pipette 200 µL of the serum sample into a microcentrifuge tube.
4. Add an appropriate volume of internal standard to each sample,
calibrator, and control.
5. Vortex mix each tube for 30 seconds.
6. Centrifuge at 1500-2000 x g for 10 minutes.
7. Transfer the supernatant to an HPLC/LC-MS/MS-compatible
vial.
C) INSTRUMENT SET-UP AND ANALYSIS:
1. Set up the HPLC or LC-MS/MS system according to the
manufacturer’s instructions and optimize parameters (e.g.,
mobile phase composition, flow rate, column temperature).
2. Set the instrument to detect specific bile acids for fractionation:
cholic acid (CA), chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), deoxycholic
acid (DCA), and ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), along with total
bile acids.
3. Load calibration standards, quality control samples, and
prepared specimens onto the instrument in the designated
sequence.
4. Begin the analysis run.
D) DATA ACQUISITION AND ANALYSIS:
1. Acquire data and integrate peaks corresponding to each bile
acid fraction.
2. Calculate the concentration of each bile acid fraction and total
bile acids using calibration curves from the standards.
3. Review the chromatograms for any anomalies or interferences.
E) QUALITY CONTROL:
1. Ensure that quality control samples are analyzed within each
batch of patient samples.
2. Assess QC results to verify the accuracy and precision of the
assay:
◦ If QC results fall outside of acceptable ranges, investigate,
and resolve the issue before proceeding.
3. Document all QC results and actions taken in the event of QC
failure.
5. REPORTING RESULTS:
1. Results are automatically transmitted to the Laboratory
Information System (LIS) from the instrument software.
2. Verify and review results for consistency and accuracy:
◦ Look for flagged results requiring further review or rerun.
3. Document any actions taken for reruns or flagged results.
4. Report results in the LIS following laboratory-specific reporting
guidelines.
6. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
1. Refer to the specific HPLC or LC-MS/MS manual and method
SOP for any limitations associated with the bile acids assay.
2. Be aware of any potential interferences from endogenous
substances or medications.
7. REFERENCES:
• Manufacturer’s protocol and calibration standards instructions.
• Relevant literature and guidelines for bile acids analysis.
8. STORAGE AND MAINTENANCE:
1. Maintain instruments according to the manufacturer’s
guidelines.
2. Perform regular maintenance and calibration checks.
3. Store reagents and standards as recommended by the
manufacturer.
By following this SOP, the integrity of bile acids testing and the
accuracy of results can be maintained, ensuring reliable patient care
outcomes.
