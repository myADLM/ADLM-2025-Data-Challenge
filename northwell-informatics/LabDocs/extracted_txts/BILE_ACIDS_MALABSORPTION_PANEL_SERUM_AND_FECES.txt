BILE ACIDS MALABSORPTION PANEL, SERUM AND FECES
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this protocol is to outline the analytical procedures for
generating results for the bile acids malabsorption panel for both
serum and feces specimens. This protocol ensures accuracy and
consistency in testing, maintains specimen integrity, and defines
corrective actions when necessary.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory staff will perform the analysis according to
this protocol. • It is the responsibility of all staff to identify any
deficiencies in the procedure that may affect test results and bring
them to the attention of a supervisor. • Staff and supervisors are
responsible for adhering to this protocol and documenting any
corrective actions that may be required.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
SERUM • Preferred: 2 mL of fasting serum collected in a SST (serum
separator tube) or plain red-top tube. • Unacceptable: Hemolyzed,
lipemic, or contaminated specimens.
FECES • Preferred: 5 grams of freshly collected feces in a clean,
airtight container. • Unacceptable: Specimens that are not properly
labeled with the collection date/time or that exceed the stability period
(more than 24 hours at room temperature or 48 hours refrigerated).
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Centrifuge • Refrigerated Incubator • Liquid Chromatography-
Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) system • Bile Acid
Standards • Appropriate controls (positive and negative) • Calibrators
• Clean Containment vessels
1. PROCEDURE
Calibration: • Ensure the LC-MS/MS system is calibrated using bile
acid standards prior to running patient samples. • Record calibration
data in the system log.
Quality Control: • Run positive and negative controls prior to patient
sample testing to ensure the system’s performance. • Document
control results according to site-specific guidelines.
Sample Preparation: A) SERUM 1. Allow serum specimens to clot for
a minimum of 30 minutes and centrifuge at 3,000 rpm for 10 minutes.
2. Transfer the supernatant to a clean containment vessel. 3. Store
the serum at 2-8°C until ready for analysis.
B) FECES 1. Homogenize the feces specimen thoroughly. 2. Weigh
0.5 grams of homogenized sample. 3. Perform a solvent extraction
based on LC-MS/MS bile acids analysis protocol. 4. Centrifuge the
extraction mixture at 3,000 rpm for 10 minutes. 5. Transfer the
supernatant to a clean containment vessel. 6. Store the extract at
2-8°C until ready for analysis.
Analyzing Specimens:
1. Load the prepared serum and feces samples onto the LC-MS/
MS system.
2. Select the appropriate bile acid malabsorption panel protocol on
the LC-MS/MS system.
3. Start the analysis and monitor the system for any error
messages or alerts.
Result Generation:
1. Review the generated results for each specimen.
2. Verify the results against the calibration and quality control
standards.
3. Record all valid results in the Laboratory Information System
(LIS) with appropriate comments for any questionable results.
4. Repeat analysis for any specimens with error messages or
alerts if necessary.
5. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results are to be reviewed and verified by the technologist and
automatically transmitted to the LIS. • Results that meet validation
criteria should be reported, while results with discrepancies or issues
should be reviewed and noted with proper comments in the LIS.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Reference intervals will be provided based on published literature or
manufacturer guidelines and should be documented for both serum
and feces specimens.
1. CORRECTIVE ACTIONS FOR ERRORS
• If the results are outside expected ranges for quality control or
calibration standards, troubleshoot the system per manufacturer
guidelines. • For serum and feces specimens that show unexpected
results, repeat the solvent extraction and analyze the specimen
again. • Document all corrective actions taken in the system log and
inform the supervisor of persistent issues.
1. DOCUMENTATION AND RECORD KEEPING
• Maintain records of all patient specimens, control results, calibration
data, and any corrective actions taken. • Ensure records are
complete and accurate for audit purposes.
