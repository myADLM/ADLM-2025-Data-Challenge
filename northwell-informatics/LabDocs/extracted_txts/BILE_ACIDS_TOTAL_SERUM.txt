Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Bile Acids, Total, Serum
1. PURPOSE: To outline the procedure for the quantitation of total
bile acids in serum samples, ensuring the accuracy and reliability of
results.
Responsibility: All designated laboratory staff are responsible for
performing this procedure correctly and must ensure the adherence
to all steps. The designated supervisor is responsible for overseeing
the overall process and troubleshooting any issues that arise.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS:
Acceptable Specimen Type:
• Serum: A minimum of 1 mL of clear serum is required for testing.
Unacceptable Specimen Types:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric specimens as they may interfere
with the assay.
Specimen Collection and Storage:
• Collect blood specimens using a standard venipuncture
technique.
• Allow the blood to clot by leaving it undisturbed at room
temperature (20-25°C) for 15-30 minutes.
• Centrifuge the specimen at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes to obtain
serum.
• If the serum sample needs to be stored, keep it at 2-8°C for up to
72 hours or at -20°C for longer storage.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES:
Equipment:
• Clinical chemistry analyzer capable of measuring total bile acids.
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes and tips
• Vortex mixer
Reagents:
• Bile Acids Reagent Kit (include name and manufacturer of the kit)
• Calibrators and controls specific for bile acid measurement
• Deionized water
• Quality control materials
Supplies:
• Microcentrifuge tubes
• Serum separator tubes (SST)
• Disposable gloves
• Laboratory tissues
4. PROCEDURE:
Preparation:
Reagent Preparation:
• Reconstitute or prepare all reagents as per the manufacturer's
instructions.
• Calibrators and controls: Prepare and handle as per the
manufacturer’s instructions.
Instrument Calibration:
• Perform calibration using the bile acid calibrator provided in the
reagent kit.
• Calibrate the analyzer at least once daily before testing or per
instrument protocol.
Quality Control:
• Run quality control (QC) materials at multiple levels (normal and
pathological) at the beginning of each batch.
• Perform QC checks following any instrument maintenance or
reagent lot change.
Sample Preparation:
• Ensure specimens are labeled correctly.
• Thaw frozen specimens at room temperature.
• Vortex to ensure homogeneity.
Assay Procedure:
1. Load the prepared serum specimens, calibrators, and QC
samples onto the analyzer.
2. Follow the specific assay protocol: a. Select the test profile for
total bile acids on the analyzer. b. The analyzer will
automatically mix, incubate, and measure the absorbance of
the samples.
3. Verify that sample integrity checks have been conducted.
Results Analysis:
• Review and validate results obtained from the analyzer.
• Compare QC results to expected ranges; results falling outside of
these limits require investigation and possible re-testing.
• Report results in μmol/L.
Post-Analysis:
• Properly dispose of all used tips, tubes, and any biohazardous
materials according to the laboratory’s waste disposal protocols.
• Clean and maintain equipment in accordance with manufacturer
guidelines.
• Document all process steps and unexpected occurrences in the
laboratory log.
5. REPORTING RESULTS:
• Results should be reviewed by a qualified technologist before
reporting.
• Input results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS) and
verify for accuracy.
6. QUALITY CONTROL AND VALIDATION:
• Regularly perform calibration and QC checks according to
institutional guidelines.
• Participate in external proficiency testing programs for bile acids
to ensure assay accuracy.
• Document all QC results and calibration activities.
7. REFERENCES:
• Manufacturer’s instructions for the Bile Acids Reagent Kit
• Laboratory’s general SOP manual for specimen handling and
storage
• Relevant peer-reviewed journals and articles on bile acid testing
8. REVISION HISTORY:
• Document revisions to this protocol, with dates and nature of
changes
9. ADDITIONAL NOTES:
• Ensure continuous training and competency assessment of
laboratory personnel performing the assay.
• Address any discrepancies or technical issues with a designated
supervisor immediately.
