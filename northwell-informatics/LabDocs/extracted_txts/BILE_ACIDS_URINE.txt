Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for BILE ACIDS, URINE
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to provide a detailed procedure for the
analysis of bile acids in urine specimens. This ensures accurate,
reliable, and reproducible results while maintaining compliance with
regulatory standards and laboratory best practices.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel trained and
authorized to handle urine samples for bile acids analysis in a CLIA-
certified laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the laboratory technologists to perform the
assay according to this SOP. The laboratory supervisor is responsible
for ensuring compliance with this procedure and for any required
troubleshooting.
4. DEFINITIONS
• Bile Acids: Bile acids are steroid acids found predominantly in
the bile of mammals. They play a crucial role in the digestion and
absorption of fatty substances.
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENT
• Preferred Specimen: 10 mL of first-morning urine is preferred
due to its concentration.
• Acceptable Specimen: Random urine samples may also be
used if properly stored and transported.
• Storage Conditions: Samples must be kept at 2-8°C if not
immediately processed and should be analyzed within 24 hours of
collection. For longer storage, freeze samples at -20°C.
6. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• Commercially available bile acid assay kits (e.g., ELISA or
enzymatic methods).
• Calibrators and quality control (QC) materials provided with the
kit.
• Urine-specific diluents as specified by the assay kit manufacturer.
• Disposable pipette tips, microcentrifuge tubes, and gloves.
7. EQUIPMENT
• Microplate reader (for ELISA method) or spectrophotometer
suitable for absorbance measurement.
• Centrifuge capable of 3000-5000 rpm.
• Refrigerator (2-8°C) and freezer (-20°C).
8. PROCEDURE
8.1 Sample Preparation
1. Thaw frozen urine samples completely at room temperature
and mix well.
2. Centrifuge the urine samples at 3000-5000 rpm for 10 minutes
to remove any particulate matter.
3. Aliquot the clear supernatant into clean microcentrifuge tubes.
8.2 Assay Procedure
1. Prepare all reagents, standards, and controls according to the
kit manufacturer's instructions.
2. Set up the required number of wells on the microplate, including
blanks, standards, QC samples, and patient specimens.
3. Pipette a specific volume (typically 10-50 µL) of standards,
controls, and specimens into the assigned wells.
4. Add the appropriate volume of the assay reagent to each well,
as indicated in the kit protocol.
5. Incubate the microplate for the specified time and temperature
as per the kit instructions.
6. Measure the absorbance at the specified wavelength using a
microplate reader or spectrophotometer.
8.3 Calculation and Interpretation of Results
1. Generate a standard curve by plotting the absorbance values of
the standards against their concentrations.
2. Use the standard curve to calculate the concentration of bile
acids in the QC samples and patient specimens.
3. Ensure that QC samples are within the acceptable range before
reporting patient results.
4. Enter the results into the laboratory information system (LIS) for
review and verification by the technologist.
9. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Run QC samples with every batch of patient samples according
to the kit specifications.
2. Acceptable ranges for QC materials should be established and
documented.
3. Investigate and document any QC failures. Retest if necessary
and take corrective actions before reporting patient results.
10. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Verify the results according to site-specific guidelines.
2. Report bile acids concentration in µmol/L or mg/dL as specified.
3. Enter any comments related to the quality or integrity of the
sample, if applicable.
11. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolysis, lipemia, and other interferences should be considered
when interpreting results.
• Refer to the kit manufacturer’s insert for potential limitations
specific to the assay method used.
12. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instruction manual for the bile acid assay kit.
• Relevant laboratory procedure manuals.
• CLIA guidelines and regulations.
13. DOCUMENTATION AND RECORD KEEPING
• All data, including QC results, patient results, and any deviation or
troubleshooting steps, should be documented and maintained
according to laboratory policies and regulatory requirements.
By following this SOP for the analytical phase of generating results
for bile acids in urine, laboratory personnel will ensure accurate and
reliable testing for clinical use.
