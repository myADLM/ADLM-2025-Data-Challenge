Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Analytical Phase for
Generating Results for BILE ACID PROFILE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to outline the steps for the analytical
phase in generating results for BILE ACID PROFILE, SERUM,
ensuring accurate and reliable results in compliance with CLIA
standards.
Responsibility:
• Trained laboratory technologists are responsible for performing
the analytical procedures as outlined.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring adherence to this SOP
and providing oversight during the analytical process.
2. DEFINITION
Bile acid profile testing is performed to measure the concentration of
bile acids in serum to aid in the diagnosis and monitoring of liver
diseases and other disorders affecting bile acid metabolism.
3. PROCEDURE
Reagents and Supplies:
• Bile acid calibrators and controls
• Internal standards (if applicable)
• Deionized water
• Serum separation tubes (SST)
• Bile Acid Assay Kit (kit-specific reagents and instructions)
• High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) or Liquid
Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) system
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Centrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Sample vials
Equipment Setup:
1. Preparation of Reagents:
◦ Prepare all reagents and calibrators according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Use deionized water to reconstitute any lyophilized
reagents.
◦ Store reagents at recommended temperatures.
2. Calibration and Quality Control:
◦ Calibrate the HPLC or LC-MS/MS system using bile acid
calibrators.
◦ Run quality control samples at the beginning of each run,
after every 10 samples, and at the end of each run.
◦ Record the results of quality control samples and ensure
they are within acceptable limits before proceeding.
Sample Handling and Preparation:
1. Specimen:
◦ Preferred specimen: Serum collected in SST (serum
separation tube).
◦ Collect at least 5 mL of blood and allow it to clot for 30
minutes at room temperature.
◦ Centrifuge the sample at 1500-2000 x g for 10-15 minutes to
separate the serum.
◦ Aliquot the serum into a labeled sample vial and store at
-20°C until analysis, if not analyzed immediately.
2. Preparation of Serum Samples:
◦ Thaw serum samples at room temperature and vortex mix
briefly.
◦ Pipette a specified volume (e.g., 50 µL) of serum into a
clean sample vial.
◦ Add internal standard and appropriate reagents based on
the assay kit’s instructions.
◦ Vortex mix for 30 seconds.
◦ Centrifuge the mixture at 10,000 x g for 10 minutes to
remove any precipitates.
◦ Transfer the supernatant to a clean vial for analysis.
Analysis:
1. Instrument Setup and Maintenance:
◦ Ensure the HPLC or LC-MS/MS system is properly
calibrated and maintained according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
◦ Use appropriate columns and settings recommended for bile
acid analysis.
2. Loading Samples:
◦ Load calibrators, controls, and prepared samples into the
autosampler.
◦ Ensure samples are loaded in a randomized order to
minimize analytical bias.
3. Running the Assay:
◦ Start the run according to the instrument’s operating
procedure.
◦ Monitor the progress of the run and record any deviations or
anomalies.
◦ Ensure the system's operating parameters are within the
acceptable range throughout the assay.
Data Analysis and Reporting:
1. Data Analysis:
◦ Analyze the chromatograms or mass spectrometry data
using the appropriate software.
◦ Ensure peaks corresponding to specific bile acids are
correctly identified and quantified.
◦ Compare the results of controls and patient samples to
ensure accuracy.
◦ If necessary, repeat the analysis for any samples with
questionable results.
2. Results Verification:
◦ Verify the results against calibration curves and quality
control samples.
◦ Ensure that all results fall within the expected physiological
ranges.
◦ Perform troubleshooting steps in case of any discrepancies
or outliers.
3. Reporting of Results:
◦ Document the results in the laboratory information system
(LIS).
◦ Review the results for accuracy and completeness before
finalizing the report.
◦ Include any pertinent comments or observations in the final
report, if necessary.
◦ Submit the results to the attending physician or department.
4. QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE
• Follow the laboratory’s quality control protocols and maintain
records of all QC activities.
• Regularly review and update this SOP to ensure compliance with
current standards and best practices.
