Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Processing Biliary
Tract Malignancy Specimens for Cytology and FISH Testing
1. PURPOSE
This procedure outlines the standardized process for the handling,
processing, and analysis of biliary tract specimens to detect
malignancy using Cytology and Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization
(FISH) techniques.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel involved in the
preparation, analysis, and reporting of biliary tract cytology and FISH
results.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Laboratory Personnel: Responsible for the accurate and timely
processing of specimens.
• Supervisors: Ensure procedures are followed correctly, review
results, and address any issues that arise during testing.
• Quality Control Staff: Regularly monitor and verify results to
ensure compliance with laboratory standards.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type: Bile duct brushings, bile fluid, or other biliary tract
specimens.
Specimen Collection:
• Collect biliary brushings or fluid in a sterile container.
• Label the specimen with patient details, collection date, and time.
• Transport the specimen to the laboratory immediately to maintain
cellular integrity.
• If a delay in transport is anticipated, refrigerate the sample at 4°C
but ensure it is processed within 24 hours.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens with no patient identification or without a collection
date/time.
• Specimens collected in non-sterile containers or with visible
contamination.
• Specimens that have been frozen.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Microscope slides
• Sterile pipettes and containers
• Cytospin or centrifuge
• Methanol or alcohol fixatives
• Staining kits for cytology (e.g., Papanicolaou staining)
• FISH probes specific to biliary tract malignancies
• Hybridization buffer and wash solutions
• Fluorescence microscope
6. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation of Cytology Slides:
1. Label the microscope slides with the patient identifier.
2. Use a pipette to transfer an appropriate volume of the specimen
onto the slides.
3. Evenly spread the specimen on the slides.
4. Fix the cells immediately with methanol or alcohol fixative.
5. Stain the slides using an appropriate cytology staining kit (e.g.,
Papanicolaou stain).
6. Allow the slides to dry and cover them with a coverslip.
B. Microscopic Examination:
1. Examine the stained cytology slides under a light microscope.
2. Assess for the presence of malignant cells, cellular atypia, and
other relevant cytological features.
3. Document findings and prepare preliminary cytology report.
C. FISH Analysis:
1. Deparaffinize and rehydrate cytology slides, if applicable.
2. Apply the specific FISH probes to the slides according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
3. Hybridize the slides in a humidified chamber at the specified
temperature and time.
4. Wash the slides to remove unbound probes.
5. Counterstain the slides with DAPI or a similar nuclear stain.
6. Examine the slides using a fluorescence microscope.
7. Analyze and document the hybridization patterns, noting any
relevant gene amplifications or deletions indicative of
malignancy.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
Internal Quality Control:
• Monitor the accuracy and precision of staining by including control
slides with known positive and negative results.
• Verify the performance of FISH reagents using established quality
control specimens.
Documentation:
• Record all findings in the LIS (Laboratory Information System).
• Review all results and documentation by the designated
supervisor or pathologist.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
Reporting:
• The preliminary cytology report should be reviewed by a
pathologist.
• The final cytology and FISH results should be integrated into a
comprehensive report.
• Document any critical findings and ensure timely notification of
the referring physician.
Tumor Board Consultation:
• If required, ensure that findings are discussed in a
multidisciplinary team meeting to provide comprehensive
diagnostic insights.
9. REFERENCE RANGES AND INTERPRETATION
• Cytology Interpretation: Classify findings as benign, atypical,
suspicious, or malignant.
• FISH Interpretation: Quantify and describe gene amplifications,
deletions, and translocations.

laboratory ensures the accurate, timely, and reliable processing of
biliary tract specimens for malignancy detection using cytology and
FISH techniques.
