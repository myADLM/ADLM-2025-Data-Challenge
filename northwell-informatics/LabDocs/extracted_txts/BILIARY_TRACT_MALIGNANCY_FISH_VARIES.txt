Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Biliary Tract Malignancy, FISH
1. PURPOSE
This procedure outlines the protocol for the analytical phase of
generating results for Biliary Tract Malignancy using Fluorescence In
Situ Hybridization (FISH). It includes the steps for slide preparation,
hybridization, washing, and interpretation of results to ensure
accurate and reliable diagnosis.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing the
analytical procedures as defined in this SOP. It is the responsibility of
all staff to ensure the accuracy, reliability, and timeliness of test
results.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimens should be processed as per pre-analytical requirements,
ensuring proper collection and handling as follows:
• Specimen Type: Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue
or freshly collected bile duct brushings.
• Unacceptable Specimens: Specimens that are not properly fixed
or are contaminated. If there is a delay in delivery or incorrect
labeling, these specimens should be rejected.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Microscopy slides
• Coverslips
• FISH probes specific to biliary tract malignancy markers
• Hybridization buffer
• Washing buffer
• Fluorescence microscope
• Immersion oil
• Fluorescent mounting medium
5. PROCEDURE
Preparation of Slides:
1. Tissue Sectioning and Mounting:
◦ Cut new 4 µm sections from the FFPE tissue block.
◦ Mount the sections onto microscopy slides, ensuring
minimal folds.
◦ Place slides in a 37°C oven overnight for proper adhesion.
2. Pre-treatment of Slides:
◦ Deparaffinize the slides by immersing in xylene for 2
minutes.
◦ Rehydrate slides through a graded series of ethanol
solutions (100%, 95%, and 70%) for 2 minutes each.
◦ Place slides in distilled water for 2 minutes.
3. Antigen Retrieval (if applicable):
◦ Perform antigen retrieval using citrate buffer (pH 6.0) in a
microwave or pressure cooker.
FISH Protocol:
1. Denaturation:
• Place slides in the pre-warmed denaturation solution at 72°C for 2
minutes.
2. Hybridization:
• Apply the FISH probe solution specific to biliary tract malignancy
onto the specimen.
• Cover with a coverslip and seal edges with rubber cement or a
commercial hybridization sealant.
• Allow hybridization in a hybridization chamber at 37°C for 24
hours.
3. Washing:
• Remove coverslip gently.
• Wash slides in 2X SSC at room temperature for 2 minutes.
• Follow with washing in 0.5X SSC/0.1% Nonidet P40 at 72°C for 5
minutes.
• Use distilled water at room temperature for a final rinse.
4. Counterstaining:
• Apply the fluorescent mounting medium containing DAPI or
another counterstain to highlight cellular DNA.
• Place a coverslip on the slide and allow the medium to dry.
Interpretation of Results:
1. Microscopic Analysis:
◦ Examine slides under a fluorescence microscope.
◦ Identify probe signals (green, red, or yellow signals)
indicating chromosomal abnormalities.
◦ Determine the presence or absence of biliary tract
malignancy markers based on signal patterns.
2. Documentation and Reporting:
◦ Record findings and images as required.
◦ Enter results in the laboratory information system (LIS).
◦ Interpret results as per established criteria for biliary tract
malignancy.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
Quality control measures include:
• Regular calibration and maintenance of the fluorescence
microscope.
• Use of control slides with known positive and negative signals.
• Verification of probe performance by testing known samples.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
Results should be reviewed and verified by a qualified technologist
before final reporting. Any critical findings must be communicated to
the requesting physician promptly according to laboratory protocol.
