Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical
Determination of Bilirubin in Body Fluids
1. PURPOSE
This procedure describes the method for the determination of
bilirubin in body fluids, ensuring accuracy and reliability of results.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to the analysis of bilirubin levels in body fluids
including but not limited to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), pleural fluid,
peritoneal fluid, and synovial fluid using chemistry analyzer.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all laboratory staff performing this procedure
to ensure adherence to this protocol and to report any deviations to a
supervisor.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Acceptable Specimens:
• Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
• Pleural fluid
• Peritoneal fluid
• Synovial fluid
Collection and Transport:
• Specimens should be collected in clean, dry containers without
anticoagulants.
• Specimens must be transported to the laboratory immediately. If
delay is unavoidable, store at 2-8°C and analyze within 24 hours.
• Avoid exposure to light to prevent bilirubin degradation.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed samples
• Specimens collected in containers with anticoagulants or
preservatives
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
1. Equipment:
◦ Chemistry analyzer capable of bilirubin measurement
◦ Pipettes and tips
◦ Centrifuge
2. Reagents:
◦ Bilirubin reagent kits (follow manufacturer's instructions for
storage and handling)
3. Supplies:
◦ Sample tubes
◦ Calibration standards for bilirubin
◦ Quality control materials
6. PROCEDURE
1. Preparation:
◦ Ensure all reagents, calibrators, and quality control
materials are at room temperature before use.
◦ Verify the calibration status of the chemistry analyzer.
Perform calibration if due as per manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Prepare controls and standards according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
2. Sample Processing:
◦ Centrifuge the body fluid samples at 3000 RPM for 10
minutes if particulate matter is present.
◦ Pipette the supernatant carefully without disturbing any
sediment.
3. Analysis:
◦ Load the samples, calibrators, and controls onto the
chemistry analyzer.
◦ Program the analyzer according to the manufacturer’s
guidelines for bilirubin measurement in body fluids.
◦ Start the analysis cycle ensuring the analyzer runs quality
control samples before patient samples to verify
performance.
4. Quality Control:
◦ Analyze quality control materials at least once per shift and
with each batch of patient samples.
◦ Compare control results against acceptable ranges provided
by the control manufacturer. Repeat analysis if QC results
fall outside acceptable limits. Document any corrective
actions taken.
5. Results Review:
◦ Review analyzer output for patient results, ensuring there
are no error messages or flags.
◦ Validate that control values are within permissible ranges
before accepting patient results.
◦ Confirm the results through second reviewer if policy
dictates.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
• Documentation: Record the bilirubin results in the laboratory
information system (LIS) promptly.
• Reference Intervals: Refer to site-specific reference intervals for
interpretation.
• Critical Results: Immediately notify the requesting physician if
bilirubin levels fall within critical limits as per laboratory policy.
8. POST-ANALYSIS PROCEDURE
• Dispose of all used materials as per biohazard waste guidelines.
• Clean and maintain the chemistry analyzer following the
manufacturer's maintenance schedule.
9. TROUBLESHOOTING
• Troubleshooting Analyte-Specific Issues:
◦ If results are unexpectedly high or low, check for pre-analytical
errors like sample hemolysis or improper storage.
◦ Re-run quality controls and patient samples if there are flags
or technical errors from the analyzer.
◦ Contact technical support from the analyzer manufacturer if
persistent issues occur.
• Technical Problems: Consult the operator’s manual. If
unresolved, escalate to the laboratory supervisor or technical
support.
