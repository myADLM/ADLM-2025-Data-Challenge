Standard Operating Procedure: Analytical Phase for Generating
Results for Bilirubin, Direct, Plasma
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the analytical phase of
generating results for direct bilirubin in plasma samples in order to
ensure consistency, accuracy, and reliability of the test results.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory personnel to follow
this protocol for analyzing direct bilirubin in plasma. This includes the
preparation, calibration, processing, and result verification stages.
1. DEFINITION
Direct Bilirubin: The measurement of conjugated bilirubin in the
plasma, which is water soluble and excreted in bile.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Type: Plasma (collected in EDTA or heparin tube).
• Volume: Minimum 1 mL of plasma.
• Stability:
◦ 2–8°C if analysis is to be completed within 24 hours.
◦ If longer than 24 hours, store at -20°C.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Centrifuge
• Laboratory grade pipettes and tips
• Bilirubin, direct assay reagent kit (as per manufacturer
instructions)
• Analytical instrument (e.g., chemistry analyzer)
• Calibrators and controls (as provided by the manufacturer)
• Documentation logs
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
1. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation:
1. Centrifugation:
◦ Centrifuge the collected plasma sample at 3000 rpm for 10
minutes.
◦ Carefully transfer the supernatant (plasma) to a clean tube
without disrupting the cell layer.
2. Day of Analysis:
◦ Ensure samples and reagents are brought to room
temperature before analysis.
◦ Mix the plasma sample gently before use.
B. Instrument Calibration:
1. Follow the manufacturer instructions for calibrating the
chemistry analyzer for direct bilirubin.
2. Run the calibrators provided in the reagent kit.
3. Check calibration curve and if necessary, recalibrate the
instrument.
C. Quality Control:
1. Perform quality control tests using low, medium, and high-
controls as per laboratory guidelines.
2. Ensure control values are within the acceptable range before
proceeding with patient samples.
D. Running the Assay:
1. Load the plasma samples, calibrators, and controls onto the
chemistry analyzer.
2. Input required information into the analyzer's interface,
including sample IDs and test code for direct bilirubin.
3. Run the assay following the analyzer’s automated procedure.
E. Result Verification:
1. Review the results on completion of the assay.
2. Ensure all quality control results fall within the established
acceptable ranges.
3. Inspect the results for any flagged values or error messages
and reprocess these samples if required.
4. Compare with reference intervals: Direct Bilirubin (0.0 - 0.3 mg/
dL).
6. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Enter the results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
and verify the entry.
2. Report critical values following the laboratory’s critical result
policy.
3. Document results on appropriate forms or electronic records for
review.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
Routine quality control measures must be strictly adhered to,
including the following of daily, weekly, and monthly maintenance
schedules for instruments, as specified by the manufacturer.

9. DOCUMENT REVISION HISTORY
Ensure to maintain a log of changes to this protocol when updates or
improvements are made based on new evidence or technological
advancements.
All laboratory personnel must be trained on this SOP and
demonstrate understanding and competency prior to performing the
test independently. Regular competency assessments will be
performed as part of the laboratory’s quality assurance program.
