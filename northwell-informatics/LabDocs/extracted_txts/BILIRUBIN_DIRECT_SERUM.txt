Standard Operating Procedure for Generating Results
for Bilirubin Direct, Serum
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized and reliable procedure for the quantitative
measurement of Bilirubin Direct in serum samples. This SOP ensures
consistency, accuracy, and compliance with regulatory standards.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all personnel involved in performing and
reporting bilirubin direct testing in the laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all designated laboratory personnel to follow
this procedure and perform the test according to the guidelines.
Supervisors are responsible for ensuring compliance and verifying
results.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred Specimen: 5 mL of venous blood collected in a Serum
Separator Tube (SST).
• Unacceptable Specimens: Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples
may interfere with results and should be avoided.
• Sample Handling:
◦ Once blood is collected, allow it to clot completely (20–30
minutes) at room temperature.
◦ Centrifuge the SST at 1500-2000 g for 10 minutes to separate
serum.
◦ Aliquot serum into a clean, properly labeled secondary tube if
necessary.
◦ Store serum at 2-8°C if analysis will be within 24 hours. For
longer storage, keep frozen at -20°C or lower.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Analyzer: Spectrophotometer or Automated Chemistry Analyzer
• Reagents: Bilirubin Direct reagent kit according to manufacturer's
instructions.
• Calibrators and controls: High and low-level quality control
materials
6. PROCEDURE
A. Calibration and Quality Control
1. Calibrate the analyzer with the bilirubin direct reagent kit
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Run quality control (QC) samples at the beginning of each shift,
and whenever a new reagent lot is opened or after instrument
maintenance.
3. Ensure QC results are within acceptable ranges before
proceeding with patient samples.
4. Document QC results in the QC logbook.
B. Sample Analysis
1. Label specimen tubes and load them into the analyzer.
2. Input the required patient information into the Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
3. Select the Bilirubin Direct assay from the analyzer’s test menu.
4. Follow the analyzer’s prompts to run the test.
5. Once analysis is complete, review the results on the analyzer
screen.
C. Result Verification
1. Verify that QC results are within acceptable limits. Reject any
runs where QC results do not comply.
2. Cross-check patient results for any flags or error messages
generated by the analyzer.
3. If flagged, retest the specimen, or collect a new sample if
necessary.
4. Evaluate results for consistency. If results are inconsistent,
perform additional testing or consult a supervisor.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
• Transfer verified results from the analyzer to the LIS.
• Review results in the LIS before final verification and reporting.
• Report results as follows:
◦ Normal range: 0.0 – 0.3 mg/dL
◦ Notify physician immediately for critical values (>0.3 mg/dL)
following the lab's critical result communication protocol.
• Document all steps taken if there are any discrepancies or
reasons for delay.
8. MAINTENANCE
• Perform daily, weekly, and monthly maintenance on the analyzer
according to the manufacturer's maintenance schedule.
• Document all maintenance activities in the maintenance logbook.
• Address and document any technical problems immediately.
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolysis, lipemia, and icterus can interfere with the
measurement of bilirubin direct.
• Ensure that sample handling and processing avoid these issues
to maintain accuracy.
