Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Bilirubin (Serum)
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to provide step-by-step instructions for
the accurate and precise measurement of serum bilirubin levels. This
document will ensure consistency and reliability in bilirubin testing
and reporting.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing,
documenting, and reviewing the bilirubin test according to this SOP. It
is the responsibility of all staff to identify any deficiencies or
anomalies during the testing process and report them to the
supervisor.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Type:
• Serum collected in a red-top tube or serum separator tube (SST).
Volume:
• A minimum of 500 µL of serum is required for the analysis.
Handling:
• After collection, allow the blood to clot for 30-60 minutes at room
temperature.
• Centrifuge the blood specimen at 1500-2000 x g for 10 minutes to
separate the serum.
• Transfer the serum into a labeled aliquot tube and store at 2-8°C if
not processed immediately. The specimen is stable for up to 24
hours at 2-8°C.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed or lipemic specimens.
• Specimens collected in anticoagulant tubes other than serum
separator tubes.
• Specimens not stored or transported at the appropriate
temperature conditions.
4. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Bilirubin assay kit
• Calibrators and quality control materials
• Automated chemistry analyzer or a dedicated spectrophotometric
bilirubinometer
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes and tips
• Protective gloves
• Timer
5. PROCEDURE
Preparation of Equipment and Reagents:
a. Verify that all equipment is calibrated and properly maintained
according to manufacturer’s instructions.
b. Ensure all reagents, calibrators, and control materials are at the
proper temperature and have not exceeded their expiration dates.
Sample Processing:
1. Verify the specimen's integrity and identification.
2. Place a small aliquot of serum into a sample cup or onto the
sample plate of the analyzer.
Calibration and Quality Control:
1. Run calibrators according to the analyzer-specific instructions
provided by the reagent manufacturer.
2. Run at least two levels of quality control material (normally one
low and one high) to ensure the accuracy of the calibration.
3. Record all QC results and ensure they fall within predefined
acceptance criteria before proceeding with patient samples. If
QC fails, troubleshoot and resolve the issue before analyzing
patient specimens.
Analyzing Patient Specimens:
1. Load the prepared specimen into the automated chemistry
analyzer or bilirubinometer.
2. Select the appropriate bilirubin assay protocol on the instrument
and start the analysis.
3. Monitor the instrument for any error messages or alerts during
the analysis.
5. REPORTING RESULTS
a. Once the analysis is complete, review the results for any flags or
error codes.
b. If the results are within acceptable ranges and QC was successful,
validate and release the results through the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
c. For results that are flagged or fall outside normal reference
intervals, verify the findings by re-running the specimen or using an
alternative measurement technique.
6. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Total Bilirubin: 0.1-1.2 mg/dL
• Direct Bilirubin: 0.0-0.3 mg/dL
7. QUALITY CONTROL
a. Maintain and monitor QC logs to identify any shifts or trends that
require investigation.
b. Perform regular maintenance and calibration of the equipment as
per the manufacturer’s guidelines.
c. Document any troubleshooting steps taken in the event of
malfunction or QC failures.
8. REPORTING CRITICAL VALUES
• Total Bilirubin: ≥ 15 mg/dL
• Direct Bilirubin: ≥ 5 mg/dL
Critical results must be communicated to the referring physician
immediately and documented according to laboratory policy.
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the bilirubin assay kit insert for specific details on limitations,
interferences, and precautions associated with the test methods
being utilized.
