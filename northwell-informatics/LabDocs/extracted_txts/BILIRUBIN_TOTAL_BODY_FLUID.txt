Analysis
Version Number: 1.0
Effective Date: [Insert Date]
Approved by: [Name], [Title]
Prepared by: [Name], Medical Laboratory Scientist
Date of Preparation: [Insert Date]
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized and efficient procedure for the quantitative
determination of total bilirubin in body fluid samples using appropriate
analytical instrumentation. This ensures accurate, precise, and
reproducible test results, in compliance with regulatory requirements.
2. SCOPE
This protocol is applicable to all laboratory personnel performing the
analysis of total bilirubin in body fluid specimens using the
designated analytic equipment in a Clinical Laboratory Improvement
Amendments (CLIA)-certified laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of trained laboratory personnel to perform the
analysis according to the procedure. It is the responsibility of the
supervisor to ensure that all personnel are adequately trained and
competent in performing the analysis and to address any anomalies
in the test results.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Body fluids (e.g., cerebrospinal fluid (CSF),
pleural fluid, peritoneal fluid, synovial fluid)
• Volume Required: Minimum of 1 mL
• Containers: Sterile, leak-proof containers
• Storage and Stability:
◦ Refrigerated (2-8°C) if analysis is to be performed within 48
hours
◦ Frozen (-20°C or lower) for longer storage
• Unacceptable Specimens:
◦ Hemolyzed specimens
◦ Specimens collected in tubes with anticoagulants or
preservatives that may interfere with the bilirubin assay
5. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• Bilirubin reagent kit (Ensure appropriate storage as per
manufacturer's guidelines)
• Calibration standards (Store at recommended conditions)
• Quality control materials (Two levels: normal and elevated)
6. EQUIPMENT
• Benchtop centrifuge
• Designated biochemistry analyzer (e.g., Cobas c 701, Roche
Diagnostics)
• Pipettes and tips (calibrated)
• Vortex mixer
7. PROCEDURE
7.1. Preparation of the Specimen
1. Centrifugation: Centrifuge body fluid specimen at 3000 rpm for
10 minutes to remove particulate matter.
2. Inspection: Evaluate the supernatant for any signs of
hemolysis or turbidity; do not use if present.
3. Aliquoting: Transfer the clear supernatant to a clean,
appropriately labeled aliquot tube.
7.2. Calibration
1. Follow the manufacturer’s guidelines to prepare and load
calibration standards onto the biochemistry analyzer.
2. Perform calibration as per the analyzer’s operation manual.
3. Document the calibration results and ensure they fall within
acceptable ranges before proceeding with sample analysis.
7.3. Quality Control
1. Preparation: Thaw or prepare QC materials according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
2. Analysis: Run QC samples at the start of each shift, after
calibration, and with each batch of patient samples.
3. Verification: Verify the QC results to ensure they are within the
established ranges. Document the results in the quality control
log.
7.4. Sample Analysis
1. Loading: Load the body fluid samples and blank control on the
designated positions in the analyzer.
2. Analysis: Input patient and sample information into the
analyzer and initiate the analysis.
3. Data Recording: Ensure that results from the analyzer are
recorded accurately in the laboratory information system (LIS).
8. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Review: Examine all results for acceptability. In the event of
any questionable results, perform re-testing or initiate
appropriate troubleshooting steps.
2. Documentation: Ensure all results are checked and verified
before reporting.
3. Flagging: Mark any abnormal or critical values for proper
medical follow-up as per laboratory guidelines.
9. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Total Bilirubin in Body Fluids: [Insert reference values] (these
will depend on the specific body fluid and established clinical
guidelines)
10. AUTOMATED SYSTEM ALERTS
1. Ensure the analyzer is set to flag any outlier or critical values.
2. Address any system alerts in real time and document the
corrective actions taken.
11. MAINTENANCE AND TROUBLESHOOTING
Perform regular maintenance of the biochemistry analyzer as per the
manufacturer’s instructions. Document any maintenance and
calibration activities. Address technical issues promptly and consult
the equipment manual or technical support when necessary.
