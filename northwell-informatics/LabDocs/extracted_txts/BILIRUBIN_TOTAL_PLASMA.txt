Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Title: Analytical Procedure for
Bilirubin, Total, Plasma
1. PURPOSE
This procedure outlines the process for the analysis of total bilirubin
in plasma samples. This includes the calibration and quality control
processes, the specific procedure for the determination of total
bilirubin, and the documentation and reporting of results.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel involved in the analysis
of total bilirubin in plasma samples using the approved analytical
method.
3. RESPONSIBILITIES
Laboratory Technologists:
• Perform analysis according to this SOP.
• Document all processes, observations, and results.
• Monitor quality control results and ensure test results meet quality
standards.
Laboratory Supervisors:
• Ensure technologists are trained on this SOP.
• Review problems, deviations, and corrective actions as needed.
• Maintain and review quality control documentation.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Plasma.
• Collection: Collect the sample in a heparinized tube.
• Handling: Samples must be protected from light to prevent
degradation of bilirubin.
• Storage: If analysis cannot be performed immediately, store the
plasma samples at 2-8°C and analyze within 24 hours.
5. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Bilirubin assay reagent kit.
• Approved and calibrated spectrophotometer.
• Controls: High and low bilirubin controls.
• Heparinized tubes for blood collection.
• Laboratory timer or stopwatch.
• Pipettes and tips.
• Documentation resources (logbook, laboratory information
system).
6. CALIBRATION AND QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform calibration of the spectrophotometer as per
manufacturer’s guidelines before starting the analysis.
• Run high and low bilirubin quality controls at the beginning of
each shift, when a new lot of reagents is introduced, and after
instrument maintenance or recalibration.
• Document all calibration and quality control results in the
appropriate log.
7. PROCEDURE
1. Preparation:
◦ Ensure all reagents are prepared according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Allow reagents and plasma samples to reach room
temperature.
◦ Ensure the spectrophotometer is powered on and
calibrated.
2. Blank Measurement:
◦ Prepare and measure a blank sample using deionized water
or reagent blank as instructed by the assay kit’s protocol.
◦ Record the blank measurement.
3. Sample Preparation:
◦ Pipette the required volume of plasma (according to the
assay kit’s protocol) into the designated sample cuvette.
◦ Add the appropriate reagents to the sample as per the
assay kit’s instructions.
◦ Protect the sample from light during the reaction period.
4. Incubation:
◦ Incubate the samples for the specified time at the
recommended temperature, usually at room temperature.
5. Measurement:
◦ Measure the absorbance of each sample at the specified
wavelength using the spectrophotometer.
◦ Record the absorbance values.
6. Calculation of Results:
◦ Calculate the total bilirubin concentration in the plasma
using the absorbance readings and the calibration curve
established during calibration.
◦ Verify the results against the calibration standards and
controls.
8. REPORTING AND DOCUMENTATION
• Recording Results:
◦ Enter the results into the laboratory information system (LIS)
or document in the designated logbook.
◦ Include sample ID, analysis date, and the name of the
technologist performing the analysis.
• Review:
◦ Review and verify results for accuracy.
◦ Ensure all quality control data are within acceptable ranges
before reporting patient results.
9. QUALITY CONTROL AND TROUBLESHOOTING
• Out of Range QC Results:
◦ If quality control results are out of range, do not report patient
results until the issue is resolved.
◦ Repeat QC tests, recalibrate the instrument if necessary, and
consult with a supervisor for further troubleshooting.
• Handling Errors and Deviations:
◦ Document any deviations from the procedure, errors
encountered, or corrective actions taken in the appropriate log.
◦ Report unresolved issues or recurrent problems to the
laboratory supervisor.
