Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Bilirubin, Total, Serum
1. PURPOSE
This SOP describes the procedure for analyzing and generating
results for total serum bilirubin in the clinical laboratory. Proper
procedural techniques ensure the accuracy and reliability of test
results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the laboratory technologists to follow this
SOP for analyzing and reporting total bilirubin results. Laboratory
supervisors are responsible for ensuring compliance with this SOP
and providing necessary training and support to the staff.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
• Specimen Type: Serum
• Preferred Collection Tube: Serum separator tube (SST, gold or
tiger top)
• Volume Required: Minimum 0.5 mL of serum
• Specimen Stability:
◦ Room Temperature: Stable for up to 8 hours
◦ Refrigerated (2-8°C): Stable for up to 7 days
◦ Frozen (-20°C or colder): Stable for up to 3 months
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Automated clinical chemistry analyzer
• Bilirubin reagent kit (follow manufacturer’s instructions)
• Calibrators and controls (specific to bilirubin analysis)
• SST, centrifuge, and pipettes
• Laboratory information system (LIS)
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
5. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation
1. Specimen Collection:
◦ Collect blood in an SST following venipuncture protocol.
◦ Allow the blood to clot for 30 minutes at room temperature.
◦ Centrifuge the sample at 3000 RPM for 10 minutes to
separate the serum.
◦ Transfer the serum into a properly labeled aliquot tube if
necessary, and cap the tube.
2. Preparation for Analysis:
◦ Ensure all specimens, calibrators, and control materials are
equilibrated to room temperature before testing.
◦ Mix the serum specimen gently by inversion.
B. Calibration and Quality Control
1. Calibration:
◦ Perform calibration according to the analyzer and reagent
manufacturer’s instructions, typically using a multipoint
calibration curve.
◦ Document calibration data according to laboratory protocol.
2. Quality Control:
◦ Run low, medium, and high-level control materials before
patient samples.
◦ Document QC results and ensure they fall within the
acceptable ranges before proceeding.
◦ If QC results are outside acceptable limits, troubleshoot the
issue following the manufacturer’s guidelines and do not
proceed with patient sample analysis until resolved.
C. Analysis
1. Instrument Setup and Operation:
◦ Enter patient and sample identification information into the
LIS and synchronize with the analyzer.
◦ Load the daily working reagent, calibrators, controls, and
patient specimens onto the analyzer.
◦ Select the appropriate assay for total bilirubin on the
analyzer’s menu.
2. Running the Assay:
◦ Begin the analysis by initiating the assay on the analyzer.
◦ Ensure the instrument operates without any errors during
the run. Monitor for any system prompts or warnings.
3. Sample Analysis:
◦ The analyzer will automatically aspirate, mix, and measure
the total bilirubin in each patient specimen.
◦ Review preliminary data and ensure flagged results are
addressed and verified.
D. Data Analysis and Result Verification
1. Data Review:
◦ Once the analysis is complete, review the raw data and
calculated results.
◦ Compare patient results to the reference interval (0.2 to 1.2
mg/dL, or as specified by the laboratory).
2. Result Verification:
◦ Verify the results against QC data to ensure reliability.
◦ Address any flagged or out-of-range results by re-running
the specimen or analyzing backup specimens as needed.
E. Reporting Results
1. Documentation and Reporting:
◦ Enter verified results into the LIS.
◦ Ensure proper documentation of all results, including any
comments or actions taken for abnormal findings.
◦ Report critical values promptly according to laboratory
protocol.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Refer to the specific QC procedure for bilirubin analysis and
ensure compliance with bi-weekly and monthly verification steps.
• Use control materials provided by the reagent manufacturer and
follow proper storage recommendations.
7. REPORTABLE RANGE AND REFERENCE INTERVAL
• Reportable Range: 0.1 to 20.0 mg/dL
• Reference Interval: 0.2 to 1.2 mg/dL (or as specified by the
laboratory)
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Follow the analyzer and reagent insert guidelines for potential
method limitations, interferences, or specific handling
recommendations.
• Ensure samples are free from hemolysis and lipemia as these can
affect the results.
