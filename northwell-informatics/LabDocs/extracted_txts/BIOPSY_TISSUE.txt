STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP)
BIOPSY, TISSUE ANALYSIS
1. PURPOSE
To define the procedures required for the processing and analysis of
biopsy tissue samples in the laboratory to ensure accurate, reliable,
and timely results.
Responsibility: Qualified and trained laboratory personnel are
responsible for the preparation, processing, and analysis of biopsy
tissue samples. They are also responsible for reporting results and
addressing any issues encountered during the process. Supervisors
are to ensure staff are adequately trained and adhere to these
procedures.
1. DEFINITION Biopsy tissue samples are collected by clinical
staff and are received in the laboratory for diagnostic and
investigative analysis. The process includes gross examination,
fixation, embedding, sectioning, staining, and microscopic
analysis.
2. PROCEDURE
3.1. Specimen Receipt and Verification: • Confirm that the specimen
container is properly labeled with patient identification, the date and
time of collection. • Verify the accompanying requisition form for
completeness and to match the specimen received. • Log the
specimen into the laboratory information system (LIS) and assign a
unique laboratory identification number.
3.2. Gross Examination: • Perform a gross examination of the tissue
sample by a trained histotechnologist or pathologist. • Document the
size, color, and any distinguishing features, and take representative
photographs if necessary. • Divide the tissue into appropriate
sections if needed.
3.3. Fixation: • Submerge the tissue sample in 10% neutral buffered
formalin for a minimum of 6 to 24 hours, depending on the size and
type of the tissue. • Ensure the volume of formalin is at least 10 times
the volume of the tissue sample.
3.4. Tissue Processing: • Transfer the fixed tissue into a tissue
processor to dehydrate the sample using increasing concentrations
of ethanol, clear with xylene, and infiltrate with paraffin wax. •
Process according to the following guidelines: - Dehydration: 70%,
80%, 95% ethanol for specified time durations. - Clearing: Xylene,
multiple changes, for specified time durations. - Infiltration: Paraffin
wax, multiple changes, for specified time durations.
3.5. Embedding: • Embed the processed tissue into a paraffin wax
block using an embedding center. • Orient the tissue in a manner that
will provide the best possible sections for microscopic examination. •
Allow the paraffin block to cool and solidify.
3.6. Sectioning: • Section the paraffin-embedded tissue block using a
microtome to obtain thin sections (3-5 μm thick). • Float the sections
on a warm water bath to flatten them before mounting on glass
slides. • Dry the slides at 37-40°C to ensure proper adhesion of the
tissue sections.
3.7. Staining: • Stain the tissue sections using an appropriate staining
technique (e.g., Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) staining). • Perform
the following staining protocol: - Deparaffinization: Xylene, multiple
changes. - Hydration: Decreasing concentrations of ethanol to
distilled water. - Staining: Hematoxylin, followed by bluing in water or
ammonia water, Eosin. - Dehydration: Increasing concentrations of
ethanol. - Clearing: Xylene, multiple changes. • Coverslip the stained
sections with a mounting medium and glass coverslips.
3.8. Microscopic Examination: • Conduct a microscopic examination
of the stained slides by a pathologist or qualified histotechnologist. •
Document any pathological findings, and capture photomicrographs if
required for documentation or further consultation.
3.9. Quality Control: • Implement and maintain internal quality control
procedures by including known control slides with each batch of
staining. • Routinely verify the accuracy and precision of the
microtome and staining equipment. • Maintain accurate records of all
processing steps and any deviations or corrective actions taken.
3.10. Reporting Results: • Record the final diagnosis and any
pertinent information in the LIS based on the microscopic
examination. • Ensure the report is reviewed and verified by a
pathologist. • Transmit the final report to the ordering physician via
the LIS or other communication channels as required.
References and Additional Procedures: • Refer to the manufacturer’s
instructions for specific equipment and reagents. • Follow any
additional site-specific protocols or guidelines for specialized staining
techniques or molecular analyses.
This protocol must be reviewed periodically and updated as
necessary to comply with new regulations or advancements in tissue
analysis techniques.
