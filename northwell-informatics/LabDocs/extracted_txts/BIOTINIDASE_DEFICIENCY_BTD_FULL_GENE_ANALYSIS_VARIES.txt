and ensures compliance with regulatory standards.
• Clinical Geneticist: Reviews and interprets test results,
confirming final reports for clinical relevance.
• Laboratory Technicians/Scientists: Perform the procedures
described in this SOP, ensuring accuracy and adherence to
quality control measures.
4. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• DNA Extraction Kit
• PCR Amplification Reagents and Primers
• Sequencing Kit (e.g., Sanger Sequencing, Next-Generation
Sequencing)
• Thermal Cycler
• DNA Sequencer
• Bioinformatics Software
• Laboratory Consumables (e.g., Pipettes, Tubes, Gloves)
5. PROCEDURE
5.1 Sample Preparation
1. Sample Type: Ensure received blood or saliva samples are
correctly labeled and matched with patient information.
2. Storage: Store specimens at 4°C for short-term storage and at
-20°C for long-term storage.
5.2 DNA Extraction
1. Protocol: Follow the manufacturer’s protocol for the DNA
extraction kit to isolate genomic DNA from the sample.
2. Quality and Quantity Check: Use a spectrophotometer to
measure DNA concentration and purity (A260/A280 ratio should
be ~1.8). Ensure that the DNA is of high quality and free from
contaminants.
5.3 PCR Amplification
1. Primer Design: Use gene-specific primers for the BTD gene to
amplify the entire coding region and intron-exon boundaries.
2. PCR Conditions: Set up the PCR reaction as per the
standardized protocol.
3. Thermal Cycling: Perform the PCR in a thermal cycler, ensuring
the correct cycling parameters are used (as specified in the
standardized protocol).
5.4 Gel Electrophoresis
1. Check PCR Products: Run a small aliquot of the PCR product
on an agarose gel to confirm amplification success.
2. Expected Bands: Verify the presence of the expected DNA
bands corresponding to the amplified regions of the BTD gene.
5.5 Sequencing
1. Preparation: Purify PCR products using a purification kit.
2. Sequencing Reaction: Set up the sequencing reaction following
the protocol for the sequencing kit.
3. Run Sequencer: Load purified sequencing products onto the
DNA sequencer and run according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
5.6 Data Analysis
1. Raw Data Collection: Collect raw data from the sequencer.
2. Sequence Alignment: Use bioinformatics software to align
sequencing data to the reference BTD gene sequence.
3. Variant Calling: Identify any genetic variants present in the
sample.
5.7 Interpretation of Results
1. Pathogenicity Assessment: Compare identified variants against
known pathogenic variants databases (e.g., ClinVar, HGMD).
2. Classification: Classify the variants according to the ACMG
guidelines (Pathogenic, Likely Pathogenic, Variant of Uncertain
Significance, Likely Benign, Benign).
5.8 Reporting Results
1. Report Generation: Prepare a comprehensive report
summarizing the methodology, findings, and clinical
interpretation of the results.
2. Review and Sign-off: Have the report reviewed and signed off
by the Clinical Geneticist.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform regular calibration of equipment, as per manufacturer
recommendations.
• Use positive and negative controls in each batch of PCR and
sequencing runs to ensure accuracy.
• Participate in external quality assurance programs relevant to
genetic testing.
7. DOCUMENTATION
• Ensure all steps from sample receipt to results reporting are
documented in the laboratory information system (LIS) for
traceability.
• Maintain records of PCR and sequencing runs, including any
deviations from the protocol.
8. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If PCR amplification fails, verify primer integrity, DNA quality, and
PCR conditions.
• For sequencing anomalies, repeat the sequencing reaction and
re-run the sequencer.
• Consult the troubleshooting section of equipment manuals for
specific error codes and recommended actions.
