Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for BIOTINIDASE, SERUM
Analysis
1. PURPOSE To provide a standardized procedure for the analysis of
biotinidase activity in serum samples, ensuring accurate and
reproducible results for the diagnosis of biotinidase deficiency.
2. SCOPE This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel involved in
the analytical phase of biotinidase serum testing.
3. RESPONSIBILITY It is the responsibility of the designated
laboratory personnel to perform the analysis as per this SOP.
Supervisors should ensure adherence to the procedure and address
any deviations or quality control issues.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND HANDLING Specimen:
Serum
• Preferred: 1 mL serum
• Acceptable: 0.5 mL serum (minimum volume)
Specimen Collection:
• Collect blood in a serum separator tube (SST).
• Allow the specimen to clot for 30 minutes at room temperature.
• Centrifuge the specimen at 1500 x g for 10 minutes to separate
serum.
Specimen Storage:
• Store serum at 2-8°C for up to 72 hours.
• For long-term storage, freeze serum samples at -20°C or colder.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed or lipemic samples.
• Samples with insufficient volume.
• Samples not stored as per guidelines.
5. REAGENTS, EQUIPMENT, AND SUPPLIES
• BIOTINIDASE Reagent Kit
• Calibrators and Controls
• Automated Biochemistry Analyzer
• Micropipettes and tips
• Centrifuge
• Vortex Mixer
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform quality control checks with each run using high, medium,
and low control serum.
• The quality control results must fall within the specified ranges
before proceeding with sample analysis.
• Document all control results in the QC log.
7. PROCEDURE
1. Preparation:
◦ Wear appropriate PPE.
◦ Equilibrate reagents, calibrators, and control materials to
room temperature before use.
◦ Set up the automated biochemistry analyzer as per the
manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Sample Analysis:
◦ Load calibrators, controls, and patient serum samples into
the designated sample racks.
◦ Program the analyzer with the biotinidase assay
parameters.
◦ Initiate the analysis run based on the manufacturer’s
guidelines.
3. Result Generation:
◦ The analyzer will measure the biotinidase activity and
generate results.
◦ Review the results for quality and flag any outliers or
possible errors.
◦ Repeat the analysis for any flagged or suspicious results.
8. CALIBRATION AND MAINTENANCE
• Calibrate the analyzer as per the manufacturer’s
recommendations before the first run of the day.
• Perform routine maintenance of the analyzer as specified in the
maintenance manual.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
• Transfer the results from the analyzer to the Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
• Verify the results against the control data.
• Document any deviations or issues encountered during the
analysis.
• Results are to be reviewed and authorized by a qualified
technologist before release.
10. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Normal biotinidase activity: 4.4 - 8.6 nmol/min/mL
• Results outside this range should be flagged for further clinical
review.
11. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolyzed or lipemic samples can interfere with the results.
• Improper sample storage can degrade biotinidase activity.
• Ensure all reagents and controls are within expiry dates.
