Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Biotin, Serum
1. PURPOSE
To ensure the accurate and precise analysis of Biotin (Vitamin B7)
levels in serum specimens using a validated and standardized
method. This protocol outlines the procedures for the preparation,
analysis, quality control, and reporting of Biotin results.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
All laboratory personnel conducting Biotin assays are responsible for
adhering to this SOP. Supervisors are responsible for ensuring
compliance with the protocol and addressing any issues or
deviations.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND HANDLING
Specimen Type: Serum Preferred Collection Tubes: Serum Separator
Tube (SST) or a plain red-top tube Volume: Minimum required
volume is 1 mL of serum Specimen Stability:
• Room temperature: 24 hours
• Refrigerated (2-8°C): 72 hours
• Frozen (≤-20°C): 3 months
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
4.1 Equipment:
• Centrifuge
• Automated or manual biotin assay analyzer
• Pipettes and tips
• Vortex mixer
4.2 Reagents:
• Biotin assay reagent kit (including standards and controls)
• Calibration standards
• Quality control materials (low, medium, and high)
4.3 Supplies:
• Serum separator tubes or plain red-top tubes
• Sample cups or tubes for analyzers
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
1. PROCEDURE
5.1 Specimen Preparation:
• Allow the blood sample to clot for 30 minutes at room
temperature.
• Centrifuge the specimen at 1500g for 10-15 minutes to obtain
clear serum.
• Transfer the serum to a clean, labeled tube if not analyzed
immediately.
5.2 Assay Calibration:
• Perform calibration using the standards provided in the assay kit
according to the manufacturer's instructions.
• Calibrate the instrument at the beginning of each run and after
any maintenance or reagent changes.
5.3 Quality Control:
• Run quality control samples at the beginning of each analytical
run, after calibration, and at regular intervals during analysis.
• Ensure that quality control results are within the acceptable range
before proceeding with patient samples.
• Document all QC results and take corrective actions if controls fall
outside the predefined limits.
5.4 Sample Analysis:
• Load the prepared serum samples, along with calibration
standards and QC materials, into the analyzer.
• Follow the manufacturer's instructions for the specific biotin assay
being used.
• Record the instrument settings and any observations during the
analysis.
5.5 Data Review and Result Reporting:
• After analysis, review the data for any flags, errors, or
inconsistencies.
• Verify that all QC results are acceptable before releasing patient
results.
• Enter the results into the laboratory information system (LIS) for
review and verification by the technologist or supervisor.
• Report critical values immediately to the ordering physician, as
per laboratory policy.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Use positive and negative controls to validate each run.
• QC materials must be used and documented as outlined in the
QC procedure.
• If QC results are outside acceptable ranges, reanalyze the
controls and troubleshoot the issue before processing patient
samples.
1. RESULTS INTERPRETATION
Reference Interval:
• Normal Range: 200 - 500 ng/L (Note: reference intervals may vary
based on the assay used and the population specificities)
Method Limitations:
• Hemolysis, lipemia, and icterus may interfere with the assay.
• High-dose biotin supplements may cause artificially elevated
results.
1. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS
• Follow universal precautions and wear appropriate PPE.
• Handle all biological samples as potentially infectious.
• Dispose of waste according to laboratory safety protocols.
1. REFERENCES
• Biotin assay reagent kit package insert and user manual.
• Laboratory safety and quality control guidelines.
• Relevant clinical biochemistry references and literature.
By adhering to this SOP, laboratory personnel can ensure the
generation of accurate and reliable results for Biotin, Serum assays,
upholding the highest standards of quality and patient care.
