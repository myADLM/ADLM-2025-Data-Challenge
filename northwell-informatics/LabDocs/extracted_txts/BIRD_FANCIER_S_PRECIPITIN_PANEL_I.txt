STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP) Protocol for
Generating Results for BIRD FANCIER'S PRECIPITIN PANEL I
1. PURPOSE
This SOP delineates the systematic procedure for the analytical
phase of the Bird Fancier's Precipitin Panel I, ensuring the accuracy,
reliability, and quality of results.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory technologists and
supervisors to perform the steps outlined in this procedure accurately
and to ensure documentation is completed in accordance with
protocol.
2. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Centrifuge
• Incubator
• Variable volume micropipettes (10-1000 µL)
• Precipitins, bird antigens (supplied by a certified provider)
• Control sera (positive and negative)
• Microtiter plate reader
• Plate shaking device
• 96-well microtiter plates
• Wash buffer solution
• Sample diluent
• Stop solution
3. DEFINITIONS
Precipitin Panel: A laboratory test used to detect the presence of
specific antibodies in a serum or plasma specimen that form visible
precipitates when combined with specific antigens.
4. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation:
1. Specimen Type:
◦ Serum or Plasma.
2. Specimen Requirements and Stability:
◦ Specimens must be centrifuged within 2 hours of collection.
◦ It is recommended that specimens be stored at 2-8°C if not
immediately analyzed, and should not be frozen unless
long-term storage is necessary. Frozen samples must be
thawed and mixed thoroughly prior to analysis.
B. Reagent Preparation:
1. Antigen and Control Preparation:
◦ Prepare antigen solutions as per the manufacturer’s
instructions.
◦ Prepare positive and negative control sera as
recommended, ensuring that control serum is run with each
batch of specimens.
2. Microtiter Plate Setup:
◦ Label the 96-well microtiter plate appropriately.
◦ Include wells for negative control, positive control, and
patient samples.
C. Analytical Procedure:
1. Add 100 µL of prepared antigen solution to each well.
2. Incubate the plate at room temperature (20-25°C) for 30
minutes.
3. Wash the plate 3 times using the wash buffer solution.
4. Add 100 µL of sample diluent to each well.
5. Add 10 µL of serum or plasma specimen, positive control, and
negative control to the appropriate wells.
6. Incubate the plate for 1 hour at 37°C.
7. Wash the plate 3 times with wash buffer solution.
8. Add 100 µL of enzyme-labeled anti-human IgG to each well.
9. Incubate the plate for 30 minutes at 37°C.
10. Wash the plate 3 times with wash buffer.
11. Add 100 µL of substrate solution to each well and incubate in
the dark at room temperature for 15 minutes.
12. Add 50 µL of stop solution to each well to terminate the
reaction.
13. Immediately read the plate at 450 nm using a microtiter plate
reader.
D. Interpretation of Results:
1. Negative Control Wells:
◦ Ensure there is no visible precipitate or color change. This
validates the test run.
2. Positive Control Wells:
◦ Ensure the development of precipitate or color. This verifies
the reagents are working correctly.
3. Patient Samples:
◦ Compare the patient sample wells to the positive and
negative control, identifying the presence and intensity of
precipitate relative to the controls.
◦ Record results accordingly. An intensity equal or higher to
the positive control indicates a positive result for bird
fancier’s antibodies.
E. Quality Control:
1. Run controls (positive and negative controls) with each batch of
testing. Ensure controls fall within expected ranges before
interpreting patient results.
2. Document all results and any discrepancies noted in the quality
control log.
3. Review control data regularly to identify any need for
procedural adjustments.
F. Reporting Results:
1. Enter all patient results and control data promptly into the
laboratory information system (LIS).
2. Verify accuracy of all entered data.
3. After review and verification by a laboratory supervisor, report
patient results according to the laboratory's reporting
guidelines.
5. METHOD LIMITATIONS
1. Ensure adherence to proper specimen handling and storage
guidelines to prevent degradation.
2. Cross-reactivity with antigens other than bird-related may result
in false positives.
