Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Birt-Hogg-Dube
Syndrome, FLCN, Full Gene Analysis
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to provide a standardized and detailed
procedure for performing a full gene analysis of the FLCN (Folliculin)
gene to diagnose Birt-Hogg-Dube Syndrome (BHD). It aims to ensure
consistency, accuracy, and reliability in the analytical phase of
generating results.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
• Molecular Genetics Technologists are responsible for performing
the full gene analysis of the FLCN gene as outlined in this
procedure.
• It is the responsibility of the supervising laboratory technologist to
review and validate the results obtained from the analysis.
• Laboratory management is responsible for ensuring that the staff
are trained and competent in performing this test.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred/Acceptable Specimens:
◦ 3-5 mL of peripheral blood collected in EDTA tubes (lavender
top).
◦ Buccal swabs or saliva.
◦ Extracted DNA from an accredited source.
• Unacceptable Specimens:
◦ Specimens collected in heparin tubes.
◦ Specimens with insufficient volume or that have not been
stored correctly.
1. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
• PCR thermocycler
• Capillary electrophoresis equipment (or sequencer)
• Pipettes and sterile tips
• DNA extraction kits or reagents
• PCR and sequencing reagents (e.g., primers, master mix)
• Agarose gel electrophoresis apparatus
• UV transilluminator
• Centrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Micropipette
• Nuclease-free water
1. REAGENTS
• 10X PCR buffer
• Deoxynucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs)
• DNA Polymerase
• Forward and reverse primers specific for each exon of the FLCN
gene
• Positive and negative control DNA samples
• Ethidium bromide or an alternative DNA stain
1. PROCEDURES
A. DNA Extraction
1. Extract DNA from the specimen using the DNA extraction kit.
2. Quantify DNA using spectrophotometry (e.g., NanoDrop).
3. Store extracted DNA at -20°C until ready for use.
B. PCR Amplification
1. Prepare the PCR master mix as follows for each reaction:
◦ 10X PCR buffer: 2.5 µL
◦ MgCl2 (25 mM): 1.5 µL
◦ dNTPs (each at 2.5 mM): 0.5 µL
◦ Forward primer (10 µM): 1 µL
◦ Reverse primer (10 µM): 1 µL
◦ DNA Polymerase: 0.2 µL
◦ Template DNA (~50 ng): 1 µL
◦ Nuclease-free water: up to 25 µL
2. Aliquot 24 µL of the master mix into PCR tubes and add 1 µL of
the DNA template.
3. Program thermocycler:
◦ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 5 minutes
◦ Denaturation: 95°C for 30 seconds
◦ Annealing: 55-60°C for 30 seconds (depending on specific
primers)
◦ Extension: 72°C for 1 minute
◦ Final extension: 72°C for 10 minutes
◦ Number of cycles: 35
C. Gel Electrophoresis
1. Prepare a 1.5% agarose gel with ethidium bromide.
2. Load 5 µL of PCR product mixed with loading dye into the gel
wells.
3. Include a DNA ladder in one of the wells for size comparison.
4. Run electrophoresis at 100V for 30-45 minutes.
5. Visualize under UV transilluminator and document results.
D. Sanger Sequencing
1. Purify PCR products using a purification kit or enzymatic
method.
2. Set up sequencing reactions using purified PCR products and
appropriate sequencing primers.
3. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for the sequencing kit.
4. Analyze sequences using capillary electrophoresis equipment.
E. Data Analysis
1. Sequence data generated is aligned to the reference FLCN
gene sequence.
2. Review sequence chromatograms for the presence of
mutations or variants.
3. Use bioinformatics tools to predict the pathogenicity of identified
variants.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
5. Include positive and negative controls in each run.
6. Genomic DNA from a known BHD positive patient serves as the
positive control.
7. Nuclease-free water or template-free reactions serve as
negative controls.
8. Technical replicates and inter-assay comparisons will be
performed to ensure consistency.
9. Any amplification failure or control test failure should be
investigated, and the assay repeated as necessary.
10. REPORTING RESULTS
11. All variants detected will be classified according to ACMG
guidelines.
12. Results will be peer-reviewed by a senior technologist or
laboratory director.
13. A comprehensive report including identified variants, their
clinical significance, and recommendations will be prepared.
14. Reports will be securely transferred to the ordering physician or
entered into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
15. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Interpretation relies on the identification of known pathogenic
variants, benign variants, and variants of unknown significance (VUS)
in the FLCN gene.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
This test is limited to the coding regions and exon-intron boundaries
of the FLCN gene. Therefore, large deletions, duplications, or deep
intronic variants will not be detected by this method.

Documentation and Records
Ensure all steps from DNA extraction to result interpretation are
thoroughly documented and maintained for future reference and
audits.
All personnel performing this procedure must be trained and deemed
competent before performing the procedure independently.
Adherence to this SOP will ensure the generation of reliable and
accurate results for the diagnosis of Birt-Hogg-Dube Syndrome.
