Standard Operating Procedure for Analytical Phase: Bismuth,
Blood (BISMUTH)
1. PURPOSE
This document outlines the protocol for analyzing blood Bismuth
levels, ensuring accurate and reliable results, while adhering to all
regulatory and accrediting standards.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Acceptable Specimens:
• 4 mL whole blood collected in a royal blue-top (EDTA) tube or red-
top (no additive) tube.
• Specimens must be collected using clean techniques and should
be free from any contamination.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens with visible clots.
• Specimens collected in tubes containing additives that may
interfere with Bismuth determinations.
• Specimens that are improperly labeled or without collection date/
time.
• Hemolyzed specimens.
Specimen Stability:
• Whole blood specimens for Bismuth analysis should be kept
refrigerated at 2-8°C and must be analyzed within 7 days of
collection.
3. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer (ICP-MS)
• Calibrators, Controls, and Reagent Kits specific for Bismuth
analysis, provided by a reputable manufacturer.
• Standard laboratory glassware.
• Vortex Mixer.
• Centrifuge.
4. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation of Reagents and Standards:
1. Prepare calibrators and controls according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Ensure all reagents and standards are brought to room
temperature prior to use.
3. Verify expiry dates and quality of reagents before preparation.
B. Specimen Processing:
1. Upon receipt, check the specimen for proper labeling and
physical integrity.
2. If the specimen is clotted or hemolyzed, reject it and notify the
submitting entity.
3. Centrifuge the blood sample at 3500 RPM for 15 minutes to
separate the plasma.
4. Transfer the plasma to a clean, labeled tube while avoiding any
contamination or transfer of cells.
C. Analytical Procedure:
1. Instrument Calibration:
◦ Perform a daily calibration of the ICP-MS with Bismuth
standards.
◦ Follow the manufacturer's instructions for calibration
procedures.
2. Analysis:
◦ Load the instrumental sequence in the ICP-MS software,
including blanks, calibrators, controls, and patient
specimens.
◦ Pipette 100 μL of control, calibrator, or specimen plasma
into appropriate sample vials.
◦ Run the analysis as per the ICP-MS operational manual.
◦ Review instrument performance parameters and verify that
all controls meet specified limits.
3. Data Handling:
◦ Upon completion of the analytical run, save and review
results.
◦ Analyze the calibrator curve to ensure proper linearity.
◦ Compare patient sample results with quality control
samples.
◦ Identify any flagged results for follow-up or reanalysis.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
Internal Quality Control:
• Run two levels of internal control material (low and high Bismuth)
with each batch of patient samples.
• Calibrate the ICP-MS daily before analyzing patient specimens.
• If controls fall outside the acceptable range, initiate
troubleshooting procedures, including recalibration or reagent
checks.
External Quality Assurance:
• Participate in external proficiency testing (PT) programs specific
for trace metals.
• Compare PT results with peer laboratories and take corrective
action for any discrepancies.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results are automatically transmitted to the Laboratory
Information System (LIS) upon review and verification by the
technologist.
• Bismuth levels should be reported in micrograms per liter (µg/L).
• Critical values (if established for Bismuth) must be verified with a
repeat analysis and reported to the requesting entity immediately.
7. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Adult Reference Interval: 0-5 µg/L
• Note: Reference intervals may vary based on patient
demographics and should be confirmed with laboratory-specific
values.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Ensure specimens are free from hemolysis as it can interfere with
accurate measurement.
• Cross-reactivity with other metals may occur; refer to the
manufacturer’s instructions for known interferences.

10. REVIEW
• SOP should be reviewed annually or after any significant change
in methodology or equipment.
• Document any review, changes, and approval dates and obtain
appropriate signatures from responsible superiors.
Responsible Staff:
• Designated technologists are responsible for carrying out the
procedure as described.
• Supervisors are responsible for overseeing adherence to the SOP
and addressing any discrepancies or issues.
