Standard Operating Procedure Generation of Results for
Bivalirudin using Ecarin Clotting Time (ECT) in Plasma
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for performing Ecarin Clotting Time (ECT) in
plasma for monitoring Bivalirudin therapy, including specimen
requirements, testing procedure, quality control, and reporting of
results.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing ECT
testing according to this SOP. It is the responsibility of all staff to
ensure that the testing is performed accurately and documented
appropriately.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Preferred Specimen:
• 3.2% sodium citrate plasma (blue top tube)
• Specimen must be centrifuged within 60 minutes of collection to
obtain platelet-poor plasma. For optimal results, double
centrifugation is recommended.
Specimen Stability:
• Plasma must be tested within 4 hours if kept at room temperature.
• If testing cannot be performed within 4 hours, plasma may be
stored at 2-8°C for up to 24 hours or frozen at -20°C for up to one
month.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens collected in tubes other than those containing 3.2%
sodium citrate.
• Specimens with visible hemolysis, lipemia, or clots.
• Specimens not properly stored or transported.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Coagulation analyzer (e.g., Stago STA-R Evolution)
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes and tips
• Timer
Reagents:
• Ecarin reagent
• Calcium chloride solution (if applicable)
• Controls: Normal and abnormal controls specific for coagulation
testing
Supplies:
• Sodium citrate (blue top) tubes
4. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Ensure all reagents are at room temperature and within their
expiration dates.
2. Check the calibration and maintenance status of the
coagulation analyzer.
3. Process the specimen by centrifuging at 1500 x g for 15
minutes to obtain platelet-poor plasma. Double centrifugation is
recommended.
Testing Procedure:
1. Aliquot processed plasma into appropriate tubes and ensure
each sample is adequately labeled.
2. Perform a quick visual inspection to ensure no hemolysis or
clots are present.
3. Place the sample in the coagulation analyzer and follow the
manufacturer's instructions to initiate the Ecarin Clotting Time
assay.
4. Ensure the proper volumes and ratios of plasma and reagents
are used as per the analyzer's protocol.
5. Once the test is complete, allow the analyzer to compute the
results.
6. Verify the results and check for any error codes or flags
indicating issues with the test run.
Quality Control:
1. Run normal and abnormal control samples before patient
testing to ensure the assay is functioning properly.
2. Document all control results and corrective actions taken if
controls do not fall within acceptable ranges.
3. Refer to manufacturer guidelines and laboratory-specific
protocols for frequency and documentation of quality control
measures.
5. REPORTING RESULTS
Result Verification:
• Review results for accuracy and consistency in correlation with
control measurements.
• Confirm that results fall within the expected reference ranges for
patients on Bivalirudin therapy.
Reporting:
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Include any pertinent comments or notes, especially in cases of
anomalous results.
• Sign off on reported results after verification.
Critical Values and Follow-Up:
• Immediately notify the appropriate clinical personnel of any critical
results as defined by laboratory policy.
• Document the notification and follow-up actions taken.
