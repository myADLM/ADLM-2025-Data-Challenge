Standard Operating Procedure for BK Virus DNA Detection and
Quantification
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to outline the process for the
detection and quantification of BK Virus DNA in clinical specimens
using real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR).
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all clinical specimens received in the
laboratory for BK Virus DNA testing, post-specimen collection,
reception, and accessioning in the laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing
the procedure as outlined and for ensuring the accuracy and
reliability of results.
• Supervisors are responsible for training, oversight, and ensuring
compliance with protocols.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type:
• Plasma, serum, or urine samples
Collection:
• Plasma or serum: Collect in EDTA or serum separator tubes.
• Urine: Collect in sterile containers.
Storage and Stability:
• Plasma/Serum: Store at 2-8°C for up to 72 hours. For long-term
storage, freeze at -20°C or colder.
• Urine: Store at 2-8°C for up to 24 hours. For long-term storage,
freeze at -20°C or colder.
5. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Real-time PCR instrument (e.g., ABI 7500, LightCycler 480)
• DNA extraction kit (approved for clinical use)
• BK Virus DNA PCR kit, including primers and probes (validated
for clinical use)
• Calibrated pipettes and filtered tips
• PCR-grade water
• Nuclease-free tubes and plates
• Refrigerators and freezers (-20°C and -80°C)
6. PROCEDURE
6.1 DNA Extraction
1. Preparation of Workspace:
◦ Clean and disinfect all work surfaces.
◦ Ensure all equipment is calibrated and functioning properly.
2. Sample Preparation:
◦ Thaw frozen samples on ice.
◦ Centrifuge plasma/serum samples at 2000 x g for 10
minutes to remove any cellular debris.
◦ Mix urine samples thoroughly.
3. Extraction Procedure:
◦ Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for the DNA
extraction kit.
◦ Ensure equal volumes of the sample are used for each
extraction to maintain consistency.
◦ Elute the DNA in a final volume as specified by the kit
protocol (typically 100 µL).
6.2 Real-time PCR Setup
1. Reagent Preparation:
◦ Thaw all reagents and samples on ice.
◦ Prepare a master mix according to the manufacturer’s
guidelines, including the PCR buffer, dNTPs, MgCl2,
primers, probes, and a Taq polymerase enzyme.
◦ Aliquot required volumes into nuclease-free tubes.
2. Reaction Setup:
◦ Label all PCR tubes or plates appropriately.
◦ Add the master mix to each tube/well.
◦ Add an appropriate volume of extracted DNA to each
reaction tube/well.
◦ Include positive and negative controls in each run.
3. Loading the PCR Instrument:
◦ Seal the PCR tubes or plates securely to prevent
contamination.
◦ Place tubes/plates in the real-time PCR instrument.
◦ Setup the PCR program as per the manufacturer's
specifications, typically including initial denaturation followed
by 40 cycles of amplification.
6.3 PCR Amplification and Detection
1. Program Details:
◦ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 10 minutes.
◦ Amplification: 95°C for 15 seconds, 60°C for 1 minute (40
cycles).
2. Data Acquisition:
◦ During the PCR run, monitor fluorescence in real-time.
◦ Analyze the data using the software provided with the real-
time PCR instrument.
7. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
• Compare the sample Ct (Cycle threshold) values with those of the
standard curve to determine the viral load.
• Results should be reported in copies/mL or IU/mL as per
laboratory policy.
• Positive Control: Ensure the positive control amplifies within the
expected range.
• Negative Control: Ensure there is no amplification in the negative
control.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include positive and negative controls in each run.
• Regularly validate the real-time PCR instrument.
• Verify the performance of new reagent lots with known control
materials before use.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results are automatically transmitted to the Laboratory
Information System (LIS) and must be reviewed and verified by
the technologist.
• Report quantitative results in copies/mL or IU/mL based on the
calibration standards used.
10. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If no amplification is observed for the positive control, repeat the
run with newly prepared reagents.
• If contamination is suspected (amplification in the negative
control), decontaminate the work area and use new reagents.
11. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions for the DNA extraction kit and PCR kit.
• Real-time PCR instrument user manual.
12. DOCUMENTATION
• Maintain records of all specimen handling, DNA extraction, PCR
setup, and results in the laboratory information system (LIS).
• Document any deviations from the SOP and corrective actions
taken.
13. SAFETY AND COMPLIANCE
• Follow all laboratory safety protocols, including the use of
personal protective equipment (PPE).
• Ensure compliance with CLIA regulations and other relevant
standards.
Review Date: Annually or as required.
