Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of BK
Virus DNA Detection and Quantification in Plasma
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to describe the procedure for the
detection and quantification of BK virus DNA in plasma samples
using real-time PCR assay. This procedure ensures accurate,
efficient, and reproducible results for clinical diagnosis and
management of BK virus infection in patients.
Responsibility:
All designated laboratory staff are responsible for ensuring that the
procedures outlined in this SOP are followed accurately and
consistently. It is the responsibility of the supervisors to oversee the
execution of the SOP and ensure compliance with quality standards.
1. DEFINITION
BK virus is a polyomavirus that can cause nephropathy and other
complications, especially in immunocompromised patients such as
those who have undergone organ transplantation.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen type: Plasma
• Collection: Plasma is obtained from blood collected in EDTA
tubes.
• Storage: Plasma samples should be stored at -20°C or lower if
not immediately processed.
• Stability: Plasma specimens are stable for up to one month at
-20°C.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Real-time PCR instrument (e.g., ABI 7500, Bio-Rad CFX96)
• DNA extraction kit (e.g., QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit)
• BK virus DNA detection and quantification kit (e.g., TaqMan BK
Virus Kit)
• Molecular-grade water
• Calibrated micropipettes and tips
• 0.2 mL PCR tubes or plates
• Vortex and centrifuge
• Biohazard disposal containers
1. PROCEDURE
A) DNA Extraction:
1. Preparation
◦ Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE)
including lab coat, gloves, and eye protection.
◦ Thaw plasma samples on ice or at 4°C.
2. Extraction:
◦ Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for the DNA
extraction kit.
◦ Ensure that the specimen is thoroughly mixed and that there
is no visible clotting.
◦ Apply plasma to the column and follow the wash steps as
indicated.
◦ Elute the DNA in a clean tube, ensuring minimal
contamination.
B) PCR Set-Up:
1. Preparation of Master Mix:
◦ Prepare the PCR master mix as per the instructions
provided with the BK virus detection kit. This will typically
include PCR buffer, dNTPs, MgCl2, specific primers, and
probes for BK virus.
2. Aliquot Master Mix:
◦ Pipette the master mix into individual PCR tubes or wells of
a PCR plate.
◦ Ensure a positive control (BK virus DNA), negative control
(water or buffer), and patient samples are included.
3. Addition of DNA Samples:
◦ Add a defined volume of extracted DNA (usually 5 µL) to the
master mix in each tube or well.
◦ Seal the tubes or PCR plate with appropriate covers.
C) Real-Time PCR Amplification:
1. Instrument Setup:
◦ Program the real-time PCR instrument according to the kit
instructions, setting the cycle parameters (e.g., initial
denaturation, annealing, extension).
2. Amplification:
◦ Load the PCR tubes or plate into the real-time PCR
instrument.
◦ Start the amplification run.
D) Data Analysis:
1. Review Amplification Curves:
◦ Analyze the amplification curves and threshold cycles (Ct
values) using the software provided with the real-time PCR
instrument.
◦ Confirm that the positive and negative controls meet the
expected criteria.
2. Quantification:
◦ Use the calibration curve to quantify the BK virus DNA in
patient samples.
◦ Record the quantitative values in appropriate units (copies/
mL or IU/mL).
E) Reporting Results:
1. Documentation:
◦ Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
ensuring accuracy.
◦ Review and verify results before reporting.
2. Critical Results:
◦ Immediately notify the clinician if BK virus DNA levels are
above predefined critical values.
3. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform quality control with each run by including controls.
• Record the results of control tests in the quality control log.
• Any deviation from expected control outcomes should be
investigated and rectified.
1. SAFETY AND HANDLING
• Follow universal precautions for handling human specimens.
• Utilize appropriate containment for handling PCR reagents to
prevent contamination.
