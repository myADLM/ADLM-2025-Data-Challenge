Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for BK Virus DNA Detection
and Quantification, Random, Urine
1. Purpose
The purpose of this protocol is to outline the procedures for BK Virus
DNA detection and quantification in random urine samples using real-
time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques.
1. Scope
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel performing BK Virus
DNA detection and quantification in random urine samples within the
designated clinical laboratory.
1. Responsibility
• All trained laboratory staff are responsible for performing the
assay as outlined in this SOP.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring that staff are
appropriately trained and procedures are followed correctly.
1. Specimen Requirements and Handling
• Specimen Type: Random urine
• Collection: Collect urine in a clean, sterile container.
• Volume: At least 10 mL of random urine.
• Storage: Store the specimen refrigerated at 2-8°C if not
processed immediately. If delays are expected beyond 72 hours,
store at -20°C or lower.
• Transport: Transport refrigerated samples on ice to the laboratory
promptly.
1. Equipment and Reagents
• Real-Time PCR System (e.g., ABI 7500 Fast, Roche LightCycler
480)
• DNA extraction kit (e.g., QIAamp DNA Mini Kit)
• BK Virus-specific primer/probe set
• PCR master mix (e.g., TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix)
• Nuclease-Free Water
• BK Virus positive control
• No-template control (NTC)
1. Procedure
6.1 Preparation
1. Turn on the PCR instrument and allow it to warm up.
2. Prepare the necessary reagents, ensuring all are thawed and
thoroughly mixed.
3. Label all tubes clearly with patient identification and control
information.
6.2 DNA Extraction
1. Pipette 5 mL of the urine sample into a sterile centrifuge tube.
2. Centrifuge at 3000 x g for 10 minutes to pellet cells and debris.
3. Carefully aspire the supernatant and discard.
4. Resuspend the pellet in 200 µL of nuclease-free water.
5. Follow the DNA extraction kit manufacturer’s instructions to
isolate viral DNA from the sample.
6.3 PCR Setup
1. Prepare the PCR master mix according to the manufacturer’s
instructions as follows:
◦ PCR Master Mix: X µL
◦ BK Virus-specific primers/probes: Y µL
◦ Extracted DNA template: Z µL (add template last)
◦ Nuclease-free water: to total volume as appropriate
2. Aliquot the master mix into PCR tubes or a 96-well plate.
3. Add the appropriate volume of extracted DNA to each tube/well.
4. Include a positive control and NTC in each run.
5. Seal tubes or plate securely.
6.4 PCR Amplification
1. Place the prepared PCR tubes/plate into the PCR instrument.
2. Program the thermal cycler with the following cycling
conditions:
◦ Initial Denaturation: 95°C for 10 minutes
◦ Denaturation: 95°C for 15 seconds
◦ Annealing/Extension: 60°C for 1 minute
◦ Number of Cycles: 40
3. Start the run and monitor for any errors during the amplification
process.
4. Data Analysis
5. Upon completion of the run, analyze the data using the
associated software of the real-time PCR system.
6. Determine the presence or absence of BK Virus DNA by
assessing the amplification curves.
7. For quantitative analysis, use the standard curve to determine
viral load in the sample.
8. Quality Control
• Ensure that positive control amplifies correctly.
• Ensure that the no-template control (NTC) shows no amplification.
• If controls do not perform as expected, repeat the assay.
1. Reporting Results
2. Document all results in the laboratory information system (LIS).
3. Report results quantitatively in copies/mL or qualitatively as
"Detected" or "Not Detected."
4. Notify the requesting physician or appropriate medical
personnel immediately for critical results.
5. References
• Manufacturer’s instructional inserts for DNA extraction and PCR
kits.
• Real-time PCR system user manual.
1. Review and Approval
• This protocol should be reviewed annually to ensure compliance
with current guidelines and technological advancements.
• Approval and updates should be documented and signed by the
laboratory supervisor.
By following this SOP, laboratory personnel can ensure accurate and
reliable detection and quantification of BK Virus DNA in random urine
samples.
