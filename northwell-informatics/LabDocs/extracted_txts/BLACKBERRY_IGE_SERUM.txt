STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase of Generating Results for BLACKBERRY, IGE,
SERUM
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this SOP is to provide a detailed
procedure for the analysis of IgE levels in serum using the
BLACKBERRY analyzer. This ensures accurate and reliable
results.
Responsibility: It is the responsibility of the designated staff to
perform the analysis as per the outlined procedure. Any deviations or
discrepancies must be reported to the supervisor immediately.
1. SCOPE This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel involved in
the analysis of IgE, Serum using the BLACKBERRY analyzer.
2. DEFINITIONS
IgE: Immunoglobulin E, an antibody associated with allergic
reactions. BLACKBERRY Analyzer: A piece of laboratory equipment
designed to quantitatively measure antibody levels, including IgE, in
serum samples.
1. PROCEDURE
4.1 Equipment and Supplies
• BLACKBERRY Analyzer
• IgE Calibration Standards
• Quality Control (QC) Materials (High, Low, and Negative)
• Serum Samples
• Labeled Tubes for Calibration, QC, and Patient Samples
• Pipettes and Tips
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) (gloves, lab coat, etc.)
4.2 Reagent Preparation
• Prepare the IgE calibration standards and QC materials as per
the manufacturer's instructions.
• Ensure all reagents are at room temperature before use.
4.3 Calibration
• Perform calibration of the BLACKBERRY Analyzer with the IgE
calibration standards before running any samples.
• Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for calibration.
• Record the calibration data in the logbook with the date, time, and
initials of the technologist.
4.4 Quality Control
• Run high, low, and negative QC samples after calibration.
• Ensure that QC results are within the acceptable range provided
by the manufacturer.
• If QC results are out of the acceptable range, troubleshoot as per
the manufacturer's guidelines and repeat QC.
• Document all QC results and any corrective actions taken in the
QC log.
4.5 Sample Preparation
• Serum samples should be collected, centrifuged, and stored as
per specimen collection guidelines.
• Aliquot the required volume of serum into labeled tubes.
4.6 Analysis
• Load the serum samples, QC samples, and calibration standards
into the BLACKBERRY Analyzer according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
• Start the analysis cycle on the BLACKBERRY Analyzer.
• Monitor the analysis process and ensure that the BLACKBERRY
Analyzer is functioning correctly throughout the run.
4.7 Result Interpretation
• Once the analysis is complete, review the results on the
BLACKBERRY Analyzer.
• Ensure that all QC samples are within the acceptable range
before reporting patient results.
• If results are flagged or unacceptable, repeat the analysis.
4.8 Data Entry and Reporting
• Enter the IgE results into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
• If results are abnormal or critical, follow the laboratory's protocol
for reviewing and communicating critical results.
• Ensure all data entry and reporting comply with laboratory policies
and procedures.
4.9 Documentation and Record Keeping
• Maintain all calibration, QC, and patient data records according to
the laboratory’s record retention policy.
• Ensure records are complete, accurate, and stored securely.
4.10 Troubleshooting
• Follow manufacturer’s guidelines for troubleshooting issues with
the BLACKBERRY Analyzer.
• Record any issues encountered during the analysis, along with
the actions taken to resolve them.
