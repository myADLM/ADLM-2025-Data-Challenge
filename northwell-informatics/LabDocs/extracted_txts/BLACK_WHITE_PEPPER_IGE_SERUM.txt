Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for BLACK/WHITE PEPPER, IGE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE:
To guide laboratory staff in the accurate and reliable analysis of
Black/White Pepper, Immunoglobulin E (IgE), in serum specimens,
ensuring the production of consistent and valid results.
2. SCOPE:
This procedure applies to all staff members responsible for the
analysis of Black/White Pepper IgE in serum specimens within the
clinical laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY:
It is the responsibility of all laboratory staff to adhere to this SOP
during the analysis of Black/White Pepper IgE in serum samples. The
laboratory supervisor is responsible for ensuring compliance with this
SOP and resolving any issues that may arise during the analytical
phase.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS:
• Type: Serum
• Volume: Minimum 1 mL
• Storage: Specimens should be stored at 2-8°C if analyzed within
72 hours. For long-term storage, freeze at -20°C or lower.
• Handling: Avoid hemolysis, lipemia, or microbial contamination. If
necessary, centrifuge serum specimens at 1500 x g for 10
minutes.
5. INTERFERENCES AND LIMITATIONS:
• Hemolysis, lipemia, and microbial contamination may cause
inaccurate results.
• Certain medications and clinical conditions can interfere with IgE
levels. Document any relevant patient history on the requisition
form.
6. MATERIALS AND REAGENTS:
• Pyrogard IgE EIA (Enzyme Immunoassay) Kit or equivalent
validated kit for IgE detection.
• Microplate reader with a 450 nm filter.
• Pipettes and tips.
• Calibrators and controls, provided with the kit.
• Distilled or deionized water.
• Wash buffer.
• Substrate solution.
• Stop solution.
• Quality control serum samples at various concentration levels.
7. EQUIPMENT:
• Centrifuge.
• Refrigerator (2-8°C).
• Freezer (-20°C or lower).
• Microplate reader.
• Incubator maintained at 37°C.
• Single-use PPE.
8. PROCEDURE:
8.1 Pre-Analytical Steps:
1. Confirm the specimen meets the acceptance criteria (volume,
integrity, labeling).
2. If any deviations are noted (e.g., insufficient volume or
hemolysis), consult the supervisor for guidance.
3. Thaw frozen specimens at room temperature and mix well
before analysis.
4. Prepare all reagents as specified in the kit insert.
8.2 Analytical Steps:
1. Calibration and Quality Control:
◦ Perform calibration using the calibrators provided with the
kit. Follow the manufacturer's instructions.
◦ Run quality control samples at low, medium, and high IgE
levels to ensure assay performance.
2. Specimen and Reagent Preparation:
◦ Bring all reagents and specimens to room temperature.
◦ Label the microplate wells according to the number of
specimens, calibrators, and controls to be tested.
3. Assay Procedure:
◦ Add 100µL of calibrators, controls, and patient serum
samples to the designated wells.
◦ Add 100µL of enzyme conjugate to each well.
◦ Incubate the plate at 37°C for 60 minutes.
◦ Wash the plate with a wash buffer following the kit
instructions, typically three wash cycles.
◦ Add 100µL of substrate solution to each well and incubate in
the dark at room temperature for 20 minutes.
◦ Add 50µL of stop solution to each well to halt the reaction.
◦ Measure the absorbance of each well at 450 nm using the
microplate reader within 10 minutes of adding the stop
solution.
4. Interpretation of Results:
• Generate a calibration curve by plotting the absorbance values of
the calibrators against their concentrations.
• Determine the IgE concentration in patient samples by comparing
the absorbance readings to the calibration curve.
9. REPORTING RESULTS:
• Report results in IU/mL.
• Reference Interval: The reference range for the test depends on
the age and medical history of the patient. As a general guide, IgE
levels less than 100 IU/mL are often considered normal, though
specific clinical judgment is required.
• Document and review all patient results according to lab-specific
guidelines before verification and release.
10. QUALITY CONTROL:
• Results must be validated against internal and kit-provided quality
control materials.
• Acceptance criteria for controls should be established as per the
manufacturer's instructions.
• Abnormal control results must prompt a review of the assay, and
potentially re-run the batch.
11. TROUBLESHOOTING:
• If the assay does not meet quality control criteria, examine
potential assay deviations, including pipetting errors, reagent
expiration, or equipment malfunction.
• Repeat the assay or contact technical support for further guidance
as needed.
12. MAINTENANCE AND CALIBRATION:
• Maintain and calibrate laboratory equipment according to the
manufacturer’s instructions and schedule preventive maintenance
checks.
