Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Analysis of Blastomyces Antibody, Enzyme Immunoassay,
Serum
1. PURPOSE
To define the procedure for the detection and quantification of
Blastomyces antibodies in serum samples using enzyme
immunoassay (EIA).
2. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the assay,
documenting results, and ensuring adherence to this procedure.
Supervisors are responsible for overseeing the process, verifying
results, and implementing corrective actions when necessary.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Collection:
• Preferred specimen: Serum
• Collect blood samples via venipuncture into a red-top or serum
separator tube.
• Allow the sample to clot and centrifuge to separate the serum.
• Transfer the serum into a clean, labeled tube.
Specimen Stability:
• Serum must be stored at 2-8°C and tested within 72 hours of
collection.
• For long-term storage, specimens may be frozen at -20°C or
lower. Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens that are hemolyzed, lipemic, or contaminated.
• Specimens received without proper labeling or documentation.
• Specimens collected in the wrong type of tube.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• Enzyme immunoassay (EIA) kit specific for Blastomyces
antibodies.
• Microplate reader capable of measuring optical density (OD) at
the appropriate wavelength.
• Micropipettes and tips.
• Clean vials for sample storage.
• Timer.
• Distilled or deionized water.
• Incubator set at specified temperature per kit instructions.
• Absorbent paper towels.
5. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
• Follow the manufacturer's instructions included with the EIA kit for
reagent preparation.
• Set up micropipettes and necessary equipment for the assay.
Assay Procedure:
1. Bring all reagents and serum samples to room temperature
before beginning the assay.
2. Dilute serum samples according to the manufacturer's
instructions, typically with a provided dilution buffer.
3. Add the specified volume of diluted serum samples, controls,
and standards to the appropriate wells of the assay plate.
4. Incubate the plate at the temperature and time specified in the
kit instructions.
5. Wash the plate with provided or prepared wash solution to
remove unbound substances.
6. Add the enzyme-conjugate reagent to each well and incubate
for the specified time.
7. Perform additional washes as indicated in the instructions.
8. Add substrate solution to each well and incubate until the color
develops.
9. Stop the reaction using the stop solution provided in the kit.
Measurement:
1. Read the optical density (OD) of each well using a microplate
reader at the specified wavelength.
2. Document the OD values for each sample, control, and
standard.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
Internal Quality Control:
• Run positive and negative controls with each batch of samples to
ensure assay validity.
• Results must fall within the manufacturer's specified ranges for
controls to validate the assay.
• If control results are outside acceptable range, do not report
patient results. Investigate and repeat the assay.
External Quality Control:
• Participate in proficiency testing and external quality assurance
programs to ensure accuracy and reliability.
7. RESULT INTERPRETATION
• Calculate the concentration of Blastomyces antibody in each
serum sample using the standard curve generated from assay
standards.
• Refer to the manufacturer's instructions for detailed guidelines on
the interpretation of OD values.
• Document and report results according to site-specific guidelines.
Critical and abnormal results must be reported to the physician
promptly.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Ensure all results are reviewed and verified by qualified personnel
before releasing.
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Provide results in the standard format as per site-specific
reporting guidelines.
9. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's EIA kit insert for detailed reagent preparation,
assay procedure, limitations, and performance characteristics.
10. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to the EIA kit insert for any limitations related to reagent
stability, interferences, and other assay-dependent factors.
11. SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS
• Follow general laboratory safety protocols while handling human
specimens and reagents.
• Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) such as
gloves, lab coat, and eye protection.
12. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If unexpected results or issues arise, consult the manufacturer's
guidelines and discuss with a supervisor for corrective actions.
By following this SOP, laboratory personnel ensure the accurate and
reliable detection of Blastomyces antibodies in serum samples,
aiding in the diagnosis and management of blastomycosis.
