Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for BLASTOMYCES
ANTIBODY IMMUNODIFFUSION, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the procedures for generating results of
Blastomyces antibody immunodiffusion in serum to ensure accurate
and consistent testing, interpretation, and documentation.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
The laboratory personnel performing the Blastomyces antibody
immunodiffusion testing are responsible for strictly following these
procedures. The laboratory supervisor or designated quality officer is
responsible for ensuring adherence to the SOP and addressing any
issues that may arise during testing.
3. PRINCIPLE
The immunodiffusion test detects precipitating antibodies against
Blastomyces dermatitidis, the causative agent of blastomycosis, in
the patient's serum. The test involves the diffusion of antigen and
antibody through a gel matrix, forming a visible precipitin line when
specific antibodies are present.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred Specimen: 5 mL of freshly collected serum.
• Collection: Use a serum separator tube (SST). Allow blood to clot
at room temperature, then centrifuge to separate serum.
• Storage and Stability: Store serum at 2-8°C for up to 72 hours.
For longer storage, serum samples should be frozen at -20°C or
below.
• Unacceptable: Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric serum samples may
interfere with the test results and should be avoided.
5. REAGENTS AND CONSUMABLES
• Blastomyces dermatitidis antigen (commercially available
reagent)
• Agar or agarose gel
• Gel plates (such as Petri dishes or glass slides)
• Positive control serum (contains known Blastomyces antibodies)
• Negative control serum (free from Blastomyces antibodies)
• Diffusion buffer (e.g., saline or phosphate-buffered saline)
• Pipettes and tips
• Incubator (37°C)
• Humidified chamber
• Clearing solutions (e.g., saline, acetic acid, or bleach)
6. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation of Gel Plates:
1. Prepare a 1% agar or agarose solution in the diffusion buffer
and heat it until completely dissolved.
2. Pour the agar solution into Petri dishes or onto glass slides to
form a thin, even gel layer.
3. Allow the gel to solidify at room temperature, ensuring a flat and
bubble-free surface.
B. Adding Antigens and Sera:
1. Label the gel plates with patient identification and controls.
2. Cut small wells into the gel using a template or sterile pipette
tip, typically placing wells 0.5 cm apart.
3. Add 10 µL of Blastomyces antigen into the central well.
4. Add 10 µL of the patient serum into the surrounding wells.
5. Include positive and negative control sera in separate wells for
reference.
C. Incubation:
1. Place the gel plates in a humidified chamber to prevent drying.
2. Incubate at 37°C for 24-48 hours to allow diffusion and
interaction between the antigen and antibodies.
D. Reading Results:
1. After incubation, examine the gel under consistent lighting
conditions.
2. Identify precipitin lines indicating positive reactions between the
antigen and antibodies.
3. Compare the patient's serum wells to the positive and negative
controls to confirm the presence of specific Blastomyces
antibodies.
E. Documentation:
1. Record the presence or absence of precipitin lines for each
patient serum sample.
2. Enter the results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
and ensure accurate transcription of data.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Run positive and negative controls with each batch of tests to
verify the accuracy of the antigen and reagents.
2. Document control results in the quality control log.
3. If control sera do not produce expected results, troubleshoot
the reagents and procedure before testing patient samples.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Positive Result: Report as "Presence of Blastomyces antibodies
detected."
• Negative Result: Report as "No Blastomyces antibodies
detected."
• Indeterminate Result: If the test results are unclear or controls fail,
repeat the test or request a new specimen.
9. REFERENCE INTERVALS AND LIMITATIONS
• Reference Interval: Absence of precipitin lines in negative control
confirms the test validity.
• Limitations: False positives/negatives may be due to cross-
reactivity, improper sample handling, or technical errors.

changes in reagents, equipment, or procedures. It should be
approved by the laboratory director and accessible to all personnel
involved in the testing process.
