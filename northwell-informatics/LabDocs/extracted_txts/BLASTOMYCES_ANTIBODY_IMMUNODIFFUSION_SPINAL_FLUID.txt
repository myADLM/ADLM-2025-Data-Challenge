BLASTOMYCES ANTIBODY
IMMUNODIFFUSION (CSF) PROCEDURE
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standard procedure for the detection of Blastomyces
antibodies in spinal fluid (CSF) by immunodiffusion.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
• Laboratory Technologists: Perform the test following the
procedure outlined.
• Supervisors: Ensure that technologists are trained and that quality
control measures are maintained.
3. MATERIALS
Equipment:
• Immunodiffusion plates
• Micro-pipettes and sterile tips
• Incubator set at 25°C
• Timer
Reagents:
• Positive control serum for Blastomyces
• Negative control serum
• Gel preparation and staining solutions
• Saline solution or buffer for dilutions
Supplies:
• Test tubes
• Vortex mixer
• Calibrated thermometer
• Calibration log for recording equipment checks
4. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Calibrate and validate equipment: Ensure all equipment used
is properly calibrated and logged in the calibration log.
2. Prepare reagents as per manufacturer instructions and allow
them to reach room temperature.
Sample Preparation:
1. Volume requirement: Minimum 1 mL of cerebrospinal fluid
(CSF).
2. Initial checks: Confirm sample identification and integrity.
Centrifuge CSF if necessary to obtain a clear supernatant.
3. Specimen Storage: If not performing the test immediately,
store the CSF specimen at 2-8°C for up to 24 hours. For longer
storage, freeze at -20°C.
Immunodiffusion Setup:
1. Plate Preparation:
◦ On an immunodiffusion plate, label the wells for patient
samples, positive control, and negative control.
2. Well Filling:
◦ Add 20 µL of positive control serum into the designated well.
◦ Add 20 µL of negative control serum into the designated
well.
◦ Add 20 µL of CSF sample into the remaining wells.
Incubation:
1. Place the plate in the incubator at 25°C.
2. Incubation period: Allow diffusion for 48-72 hours, checking
periodically.
Reading Results:
1. Staining: Remove the plate from the incubator and follow the
staining protocol provided. Allow the plate to dry completely.
2. Interpretation:
◦ Positive Result: Visible precipitin line between the patient
well and the antigen well, exhibiting the same intensity as
the positive control.
◦ Negative Result: No precipitin line or very faint lines, similar
in intensity to the negative control.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Controls:
◦ Run positive and negative controls with each batch of
patient samples.
◦ Ensure controls fall within expected ranges. If not, repeat
test and troubleshoot possible causes.
2. Documentation:
◦ Record all results on the Blastomyces Immunodiffusion Log
Sheet, including controls and patient results.
◦ Note any deviations or issues during the procedure and
corrective actions taken.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Results Entry:
◦ Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
ensuring accuracy and completeness.
2. Flagging Abnormal Results:
◦ Flag any positive results as critical and communicate to the
concerned healthcare provider immediately.

Immunodiffusion testing
8. SAMPLE INTEGRITY
• Hemolysis, clots, or improper storage may compromise the
integrity of the CSF sample.
• Document and consult the supervisor for any issues related to
sample integrity.
9. TROUBLESHOOTING
• Inconsistent controls: Check and recalibrate equipment. Consult
manufacturer’s trouble-shooting tips.
• Weak or no precipitin lines: Ensure proper sample and reagent
preparation; repeat the test if necessary.

Blastomyces Antibody Immunodiffusion test on CSF, ensuring
consistency, accuracy, and quality control throughout the analytical
phase.
