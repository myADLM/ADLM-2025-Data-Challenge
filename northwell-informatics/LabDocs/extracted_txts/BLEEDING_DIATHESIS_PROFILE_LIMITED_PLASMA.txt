STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE ANALYSTICAL PHASE:
BLEEDING DIATHESIS PROFILE, LIMITED, PLASMA
1. PURPOSE: The purpose of this protocol is to establish
standardized procedures for the analysis and generation of
results for the Bleeding Diathesis Profile, Limited, Plasma. This
profile typically includes assays for prothrombin time (PT),
activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), fibrinogen, and
platelet function or related factors. This ensures the reliability
and accuracy of test results.
Responsibility:
• It is the responsibility of the trained laboratory personnel to
perform and document all steps as outlined in this SOP.
• All staff should identify any issues in the testing procedures and
report any discrepancies to a supervisor immediately.
1. DEFINITION: The Bleeding Diathesis Profile, Limited, Plasma is
a specialized test panel used to evaluate bleeding disorders
and assess hemostasis.
2. PROCEDURE:
A) Specimen:
• Preferred: Plasma collected in a light-blue top (3.2% sodium
citrate) tube.
• Specimen should be centrifuged, and plasma aliquoted into a
plastic tube immediately.
• Unacceptable: Clotted samples, hemolyzed samples, non-citrated
plasma, and specimens not correctly labeled or with insufficient
volume (<1 mL).
B) Equipment and Reagents:
• Coagulation analyzer (verify calibration as per manufacturer
guidelines)
• Reagents specific for PT, aPTT, fibrinogen, and platelet function
assays from trusted suppliers.
• Control materials - normal and abnormal levels (2 levels
minimum).
C) Analytical Procedure:
1. Check all reagents and control materials for expiry dates and
proper storage conditions.
2. Conduct daily quality control (QC) checks with both normal and
abnormal control materials. Document the QC results. Do not
proceed with patient testing if QC results are out of acceptable
range.
3. Program the analyzer for each specific test (PT, aPTT,
Fibrinogen, Platelet Function) as per the manufacturer's
recommendations.
D) Prothrombin Time (PT) Assay:
1. Program analyzer with the required reagents.
2. Add the specified volume of plasma to the appropriate reaction
cuvette.
3. Incubate at 37°C as per assay procedure.
4. Add thromboplastin reagent, mix, and measure the time until
clot formation.
5. Record the result in seconds and/or INR (International
Normalized Ratio).
E) Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT) Assay:
1. Program analyzer with required reagents.
2. Add the specified volume of plasma to the appropriate reaction
cuvette.
3. Incubate at 37°C, then add aPTT reagent followed by calcium
chloride solution.
4. Measure the time until clot formation.
5. Record the result in seconds.
F) Fibrinogen Assay:
1. Prepare and standardize the fibrinogen assay as per the
analyzer's recommendations.
2. Add plasma to the cuvette and allow for incubation.
3. Add the fibrinogen specific reagent and measure the time taken
for fibrin clot formation.
4. Utilize the calibrated curve to determine fibrinogen
concentration.
5. Record the result in mg/dL.
G) Platelet Function or Related Factors:
1. Perform any additional tests for specific factors or platelet
function as per their own specific procedures.
2. Ensure each test is performed to the manufacturer’s guidelines
and specifications.
H) Reporting Results:
1. Review all results for completeness and accuracy.
2. Document findings in the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
ensuring all details such as patient ID, test panel, results with
units, and any comments are included.
3. Reference intervals specific to each test should be included.
(See "Reporting Results")
I) Quality Control and Troubleshooting:
1. Should QC results fall outside acceptable limits, verify reagent
integrity, instrument calibration, and sample handling.
2. Repeat the QC runs. If still unacceptable, follow trouble-
shooting guidelines provided by the manufacturer.
3. Report persistent issues to the supervisor and document the
troubleshooting steps.
J) References:
• Manufacturer’s instructions and product inserts for reagents and
instruments.
• Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines.
• Laboratory policy and procedures for reporting and
documentation.
1. DOCUMENTATION:
• Maintain log records of all testing, QC results, calibration records,
maintenance logs, and troubleshooting activities.
• Ensure all relevant information is entered into the LIS accurately,
including identifiers, date and time of testing, initials of the
technologist, and any noted observations.
1. SAFETY AND COMPLIANCE:
• Adhere to standard laboratory safety protocols including use of
PPE.
• Dispose of waste and sharps in accordance with biohazard
regulations.
• Follow CLIA, CAP, and institutional guidelines for laboratory
testing.
