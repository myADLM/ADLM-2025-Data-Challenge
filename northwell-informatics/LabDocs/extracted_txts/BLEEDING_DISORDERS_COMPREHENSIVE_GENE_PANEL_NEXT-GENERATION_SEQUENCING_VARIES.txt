Standard Operating Procedure: Analytical Phase for Generating
Results for Bleeding Disorders, Comprehensive Gene Panel by
Next-Generation Sequencing
1. PURPOSE This procedure details the steps needed to analyze
and generate accurate and reproducible results for comprehensive
gene panels investigating bleeding disorders using next-generation
sequencing (NGS).
2. SCOPE This SOP applies to the Clinical Laboratory staff
performing NGS for the detection of genetic variants associated with
bleeding disorders.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Laboratory Technologists are responsible for performing the
steps as outlined in this SOP.
• Supervisors ensure compliance with the SOP and address any
issues arising during the process.
• Laboratory Director oversees procedures and is the final
authority on data interpretation.
4. MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT
• Illumina MiSeq or equivalent NGS platform
• DNA extraction kit (validated for use in NGS)
• Library preparation kit specific for target gene panel
• PCR reagents and thermal cycler
• NGS sequencing kits and reagents
• Bioinformatics software for data analysis (e.g., BWA, GATK,
Annovar)
• Positive and negative controls
5. PROCEDURE
A) DNA Extraction
1. Extract DNA from the collected specimens using a validated
extraction method.
2. Measure DNA concentration and assess the quality using a
spectrophotometer or fluorometer.
3. Ensure DNA integrity by running an aliquot on an agarose gel
or using capillary electrophoresis, if necessary.
B) Library Preparation and Enrichment
1. Perform DNA fragmentation as required by the library
preparation kit.
2. Prepare DNA libraries following the manufacturer’s protocol,
including end-repair, A-tailing, adapter ligation, and PCR
amplification.
3. Enrich the target regions using the appropriate gene panel kit.
4. Perform quality control of the prepared libraries using either
bioanalyzer or similar technology to confirm the size distribution
and concentration of the libraries.
C) Sequencing
1. Load libraries onto the NGS platform according to the
manufacturer's protocols.
2. Run sequencing using appropriate flow cell and sequencing
kits.
D) Data Analysis
1. Initial Data Processing
◦ Perform base calling and generate FASTQ files.
◦ Assess read quality (e.g., using FastQC or similar tools).
2. Alignment and Variant Calling
◦ Align reads to the reference human genome (e.g., using
BWA).
◦ Perform variant calling using tools like GATK, SAMtools, etc.
3. Variant Annotation
◦ Annotate variants with information on gene function,
potential pathogenicity, and population frequency using tools
such as Annovar, SnpEff, or equivalent.
4. Data Filtering
◦ Filter out common benign variants based on population
frequency databases (e.g., ExAC, gnomAD).
◦ Prioritize variants based on clinical relevance, predicted
pathogenicity, and the known association with bleeding
disorders.
E) Interpretation
1. Interpret the filtered variants considering the clinical details
provided.
2. Confirm potential pathogenic variants with orthogonal methods,
if necessary (e.g., Sanger sequencing).
3. Document and report findings in a clear, concise, and clinically
relevant format.
F) Reporting Results
1. Generate a comprehensive report detailing:
◦ Patient identification and clinical information
◦ Methods used (including library preparation, sequencing,
and data analysis tools)
◦ Identified variants and their clinical significance
◦ Interpretation and clinical correlation
2. Ensure results are reviewed and verified by a qualified clinical
geneticist or laboratory director.
3. Communicate the results to the ordering physician following the
lab’s guidelines for reporting.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include positive and negative controls in each run to ensure the
reliability of the results.
• Validate the sequencing run by checking the quality metrics (e.g.,
Q30 scores, coverage).
• Perform regular maintenance and calibration of equipment as per
manufacturers' guidelines.
• Document and address any deviations from expected
performance metrics promptly.
7. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS
• Follow all safety protocols, including using appropriate PPE.
• Handle all reagents and specimens according to the laboratory’s
biosafety guidelines.
• Dispose of waste materials in compliance with local regulations.
8. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's manuals for DNA extraction kits, library
preparation kits, and sequencing platforms.
• Illumina MiSeq User Guide or equivalent for NGS platform.
• Publications and databases related to bleeding disorders and
genetic variants.
