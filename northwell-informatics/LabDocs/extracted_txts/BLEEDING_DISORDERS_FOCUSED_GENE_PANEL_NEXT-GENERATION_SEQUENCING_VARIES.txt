Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase:
Bleeding Disorders Focused Gene Panel – Next-Generation
Sequencing
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this protocol is to outline the specific procedures
involved in the analytical phase of processing, evaluating, and
generating results from a Bleeding Disorders Focused Gene Panel
using next-generation sequencing (NGS).
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory technologists and supervisors are
responsible for performing, monitoring, and documenting all steps
outlined in this protocol.
• All personnel involved must ensure high-quality, accurate, and
valid results by strictly adhering to the procedures.
1. DEFINITIONS
• Bleeding Disorders Focused Gene Panel: A specific array of
genes associated with bleeding disorders analyzed for mutations
or genetic variations.
• Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS): High-throughput sequencing
technology used to determine the sequence of nucleotides in
DNA.
• Quality Control (QC): Procedures followed to maintain accuracy
and precision in assays.
1. PROCEDURE
Equipment, Instruments, and Reagents:
• NGS System (e.g., Illumina, Thermo Fisher)
• Quantification instruments (e.g., fluorometer, qPCR machine)
• DNA extraction kits
• Library preparation kits
• Sequencing reagents and consumables
• Clean and DNA-free workspace
• Appropriate PPE (lab coats, gloves, etc.)
• Laboratory Information System (LIS)
A) DNA Extraction and Quantification:
1. Sample Preparation:
◦ Ensure each sample is properly labeled and processed
promptly.
◦ Perform DNA extraction using the appropriate blood or
tissue sample according to the supplied kit’s instructions.
◦ Quantify DNA concentration using a fluorometer and assess
purity using UV spectroscopy.
2. Criteria for DNA:
◦ Final DNA concentration should fall within the acceptable
range specified by the library preparation protocol.
◦ Purity ratios (A260/A280) must be between 1.8 to 2.0.
3. Documentation:
◦ Record DNA concentration, purity, sample ID, date, and
technologist’s initials.
B) Library Preparation:
1. Procedure:
◦ Follow the manufacturer's protocol for enzymatic
fragmentation, adapter ligation, and PCR enrichment.
◦ Ensure proper mixing and volume precision to avoid errors.
2. Quality Control:
◦ Assess the size distribution of libraries using an automated
electrophoresis system (e.g., Bioanalyzer or TapeStation).
◦ Quantify the final libraries using qPCR.
3. Documentation:
◦ Log all data including library size distribution and
concentration.
C) Sequencing:
1. Loading and Running:
◦ Load libraries onto the sequencing flow cell as per
manufacturer’s guidelines.
◦ Enter sample information into the NGS instrument’s
software system and initiate the sequencing run.
◦ Monitor sequencing progress regularly.
2. Quality Control:
◦ Perform a real-time data check for base call accuracy,
cluster density, and Q-scores.
3. Documentation:
◦ Record run ID, start and completion times, any issues
encountered, and technologists’ initials.
D) Data Analysis:
1. Primary Analysis:
◦ Use onboard software for base calling and quality filtering of
raw sequencing data.
◦ Generate FASTQ files.
2. Secondary Analysis:
◦ Align FASTQ files to the reference genome using
bioinformatics tools (e.g., BWA, Bowtie).
◦ Call variants (e.g., GATK, SAMtools).
3. Tertiary Analysis:
◦ Annotate variants using databases and tools (e.g.,
ANNOVAR, ClinVar) to classify pathogenicity.
4. Bioinformatics QC:
◦ Ensure adherence to parameters like depth of coverage
(>30X), variant quality score, and read mapping percentage.
5. Documentation:
◦ Maintain accurate logs of analysis workflow, parameters
used, software versions, and technologists’ initials.
E) Result Validation and Reporting:
1. Review:
◦ Have a secondary technologist or supervisor review the
analyzed data and findings.
◦ Check for consistency and accuracy.
2. Interpretation:
◦ Interpret and correlate identified variants with clinical data
available.
◦ Generate a comprehensive report including relevant
findings, associated literature, and clinical significance.
3. Documentation and Verification:
◦ The final report must be documented in the LIS and undergo
verification from a quality control supervisor.
◦ Ensure patient confidentiality while handling data.
4. Report Delivery:
◦ Send the final validated report to the authorized healthcare
provider.
◦ Retain a copy of the report as per laboratory policy.
4. QUALITY CONTROL AND TROUBLESHOOTING
1. Regular QC:
◦ Perform regular QC of equipment, reagents, and data to
ensure ongoing accuracy.
◦ Troubleshoot immediately if QC parameters fall outside the
acceptable range.
2. Documentation:
◦ All QC performed must be documented in detail, including
dates, findings, and actions taken.
