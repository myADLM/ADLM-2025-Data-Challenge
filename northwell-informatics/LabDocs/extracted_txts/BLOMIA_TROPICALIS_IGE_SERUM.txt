Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for BLOMIA
TROPICALIS, IGE, SERUM Analysis
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the accurate and
reproducible analysis of Blomia tropicalis-specific Immunoglobulin E
(IgE) levels in serum samples.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the trained laboratory technologist to follow
this procedure when analyzing serum samples for Blomia tropicalis-
specific IgE levels. The supervisor must ensure that all personnel are
adequately trained and that equipment is properly maintained and
calibrated.
3. DEFINITIONS
• Blomia tropicalis IgE: Immunoglobulin E antibodies specific to
the Blomia tropicalis mite allergen.
• EIA: Enzyme Immunoassay, a method used for IgE determination.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STORAGE
• Preferred Sample Type: Serum.
• Volume: Minimum 0.5 mL of serum.
• Stability:
◦ Room Temperature (15-25°C): Up to 8 hours.
◦ Refrigerated (2-8°C): Up to 7 days.
◦ Frozen (-20°C or lower): Up to 1 month (avoid repeated
freeze-thaw cycles).
• Unacceptable Conditions:
◦ Hemolyzed samples.
◦ Lipemic samples.
◦ Samples with insufficient volume.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Equipment:
◦ Microplate reader capable of reading absorbance at
appropriate wavelengths (e.g., 450 nm).
◦ Microplate washer.
◦ Centrifuge.
◦ Refrigerator (2-8°C) and freezer (-20°C or lower).
• Reagents:
◦ Specific IgE assay kit for Blomia tropicalis (e.g., commercially
available ELISA kit).
◦ Calibrators and controls provided with the kit.
◦ Wash buffer, diluents, and substrate solutions as specified in
the kit insert.
• Supplies:
◦ Micropipettes and tips.
◦ 96-well microplates.
◦ Serological pipettes.
6. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Reagent Preparation:
◦ Prepare all reagents according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
◦ Bring all reagents and samples to room temperature before
use.
2. Sample Preparation:
◦ Thaw frozen samples completely and mix gently.
◦ Centrifuge samples if necessary to remove particulates
(e.g., 10 minutes at 3,000 RPM).
Assay Procedure:
1. Calibration and Control:
◦ Include calibrators and controls in each assay run to ensure
assay validity.
◦ Prepare a calibration curve using the provided standards.
2. Sample Addition:
◦ Pipette the appropriate volume of calibrator, control, and
patient serum samples into the designated wells of the
microplate.
3. Incubation:
◦ Adhere to the incubation times and temperatures as
specified in the kit insert.
◦ Cover the plate to prevent evaporation during incubation.
4. Washing:
◦ Perform washing steps as per the kit instructions using a
microplate washer or manual washing.
5. Substrate Addition:
◦ Add substrate solution to each well and incubate for the time
specified.
6. Stopping Reaction:
◦ Add stop solution to each well to terminate the reaction.
7. Reading:
◦ Measure the absorbance of each well at the specified
wavelength (e.g., 450 nm) using a microplate reader.
Data Analysis:
1. Plot the calibration curve using the absorbance values of the
calibrators.
2. Determine the IgE concentration in each sample by
interpolating from the calibration curve.
3. Validate the results using the control data.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run quality control materials with each assay batch.
• Acceptable control ranges must be defined and adhered to.
• If controls are outside of the acceptable range, identify and
correct the problem before reporting patient results.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Report results in kUA/L (kilo Units of Allergen-specific IgE per liter
of serum).
• Include reference intervals for interpretation (provided by the kit or
laboratory-specific).
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Cross-reactivity with other allergens may occur; refer to the
manufacturer's insert for details.
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples may affect results.
