Blood Culture Analysis SOP
1. PURPOSE
To establish and standardize the procedure for analyzing blood
cultures to detect bacteremia and fungemia. This protocol ensures
that blood culture specimens are processed accurately, efficiently,
and within the required timeframes to provide valid and timely results
for clinical decision-making.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of all qualified laboratory personnel to adhere
strictly to this SOP to ensure the integrity and accuracy of the test
results. Supervisors are responsible for overseeing the adherence to
this protocol and for addressing any deficiencies or issues.
1. DEFINITIONS
Blood Culture: A laboratory test used to detect the presence of
bacteria or fungi in a patient's blood.
Automated Blood Culture System: An instrument designed for the
incubation and monitoring of blood culture bottles for microbial
growth.
1. PROCEDURE
A) Blood Culture Bottles and Media:
• Each blood culture set consists of an aerobic bottle and an
anaerobic bottle, or equivalent pediatric bottles for pediatric
patients.
• The blood culture bottles contain broth media that support the
growth of potentially infectious microorganisms.
B) Specimen Receipt and Preparation:
• Upon receipt, verify that the blood culture bottles are labeled
correctly with patient identification and collection details.
• Log the receipt of the specimen into the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
• Inspect bottles for evidence of leakage or contamination. Do not
accept specimens with visible defects or signs of damage.
• Allow refrigerated specimens to reach room temperature before
processing.
C) Incubation of Blood Culture Bottles:
• Load the blood culture bottles into an automated blood culture
system (e.g., BacT/ALERT, BACTEC).
• Ensure that the bottles are placed in the appropriate positions as
per the manufacturer's guidelines.
• The system will continuously monitor the bottles for signs of
microbial growth by detecting changes in CO2 production or other
metabolic activity.
• Record the start time of the incubation in the LIS.
D) Monitoring and Detection:
• The automated blood culture system will alert laboratory
personnel if microbial growth is detected in any of the bottles.
• Upon an alert, remove the positive bottle from the system for
further analysis.
• Negative bottles will continue to be incubated and monitored for
the standard incubation period (typically 5-7 days).
E) Positive Blood Culture Workflow:
• Perform a Gram stain on the positive bottle to provide an initial
indication of the type of microorganisms present.
• Prepare a smear by transferring a small amount of liquid from the
positive bottle onto a microscope slide. Heat-fix the smear and
stain with Gram stain reagents.
• Examine the stained slide under a microscope to classify the
microorganisms as Gram-positive or Gram-negative and
determine their morphology (e.g., cocci, rods).
F) Subculturing and Identification:
• From the positive bottle, inoculate appropriate agar plates (e.g.,
blood agar, MacConkey agar, chocolate agar) and/or broth media
for the isolation and identification of the organism.
• Streak the plates using a sterile loop, ensuring even distribution of
the sample.
• Incubate the inoculated plates and/or broth media under
appropriate atmospheric conditions (e.g., aerobic, anaerobic, or
CO2) and temperatures (e.g., 35-37°C).
• Monitor the plates and/or broth media for growth, usually within
24-48 hours.
G) Identification and Sensitivity Testing:
• Once colonies are observed, perform further identification tests
using biochemical, immunological, or molecular methods, as
appropriate (e.g., MALDI-TOF MS, VITEK 2, or API strips).
• Conduct antimicrobial susceptibility testing on clinically significant
isolates to determine the appropriate treatment options.
• Document the results in the LIS for review and verification by the
technologist.
H) Reporting Results:
• Review and verify all preliminary and final results in the LIS.
• Communicate preliminary positive results (e.g., Gram stain
findings) to the treating physician or clinical team as soon as
available.
• Finalized identification and sensitivity results should be reported
promptly through the LIS and reviewed by the clinical
microbiologist or supervisor.
• Enter critical results in the LIS and notify the treating physician
directly if required by the laboratory's critical value policy.
I) Quality Control:
• Run quality control checks on the automated blood culture system
daily using control organisms to ensure the proper operation of
the instrument.
• Record the results of quality control tests in a log.
• Perform routine maintenance and calibration of the automated
blood culture system as per the manufacturer's instructions.
J) Documenting and Troubleshooting:
• Record any issues or anomalies observed during the testing
process in the incident log and report them to a supervisor.
• Implement corrective actions, if necessary, as per the laboratory’s
standard procedures.
References:
• Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines for
blood culture processing.
• Manufacturer’s manual for the automated blood culture system in
use.
• Laboratory's internal procedural manuals and quality assurance
protocols.
By following this SOP, the laboratory ensures that all blood cultures
are processed consistently, accurately, and efficiently, providing
reliable data for patient diagnosis and treatment.
