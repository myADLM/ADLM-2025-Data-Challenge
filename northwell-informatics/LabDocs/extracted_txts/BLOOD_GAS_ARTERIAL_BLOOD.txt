Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Title: Analytical Phase for
Blood Gas Analysis (Arterial Blood)
1. PURPOSE To provide standardized procedures for the accurate
analysis of arterial blood gases (ABG), ensuring reliable and
consistent results. This procedure outlines the steps required
for the analytical phase of arterial blood gas testing.
2. SCOPE This SOP applies to all medical laboratory scientists
and technicians performing arterial blood gas analysis in our
laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory personnel to
perform ABG analysis according to this SOP.
• Supervisors are responsible for training staff in this procedure and
ensuring that it is followed correctly.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
• Specimen type: Arterial blood.
• Collection: Use a vented or non-vented blood gas syringe
containing low concentration balanced lithium heparin.
• Handling: After collection, expel any air from the syringe, remove
the needle, cap the syringe, and mix the blood thoroughly by
gently rolling the syringe between the hands.
• Transport: Specimen must be analyzed immediately after
collection. In case of a delay, the sample should be maintained at
room temperature and analyzed within 30 minutes.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens containing significant air bubbles (>10%).
• Specimens received with the needle attached.
• Specimens that have clotted.
• Blood collected in sodium citrate, sodium fluoride/oxalate, or
EDTA tubes.
1. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
• ABL 90 Blood Gas Analyzer or equivalent.
• Blood gas syringe.
• Personal protective equipment (PPE).
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Internal quality control using three levels of QC material
automatically analyzed by the ABL 90 according to the set
schedule.
• Bi-weekly and monthly intralab comparison with other analyzers
as documented.
• Validate new lot number solution packs and sensor cassettes with
patient comparisons as detailed in the SOP.
1. PROCEDURE
2. Prepare the ABL 90 Blood Gas Analyzer:
◦ Ensure that the device is calibrated and quality control tests
are within acceptable limits according to manufacturer
instructions.
◦ Verify that the necessary reagents and consumables are
available and within their expiration dates.
3. Specimen Analysis:
◦ Mix the arterial blood sample thoroughly as described.
◦ Remove any air bubbles from the syringe.
◦ Insert the syringe into the ABL 90 analyzer, following the
manufacturer’s instructions.
4. Enter Patient Identification:
◦ Input relevant patient data into the analyzer.
◦ Verify that patient ID and specimen details match requisition
forms.
5. Initiate Analysis:
◦ Close the analyzer’s sample compartment and begin the
analysis process.
◦ Monitor the progress of the analysis on the display.
6. Result Verification:
◦ Review results for any error messages or indications of
instrument failure.
◦ Verify that all analytes are within acceptable ranges.
◦ If an error message appears, refer to the troubleshooting
guide in the analyzer’s manual.
◦ If there is a quality control failure, repeat the analysis on
another analyzer if available or contact a supervisor.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
• Verified results are automatically transmitted to the Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
• Review results on the LIS, verifying the integrity of the data before
releasing results.
• Communicate critical results immediately to the relevant clinical
team following the established critical value reporting protocol.
1. MAINTENANCE
• Perform daily, weekly, and monthly maintenance tasks on the ABL
90 analyzer as per manufacturer’s instructions.
• Document all maintenance activities in the equipment log.
1. DOCUMENTATION
• Record all analytical details in the blood gas analysis log,
including patient identification, date, time, and initials of staff
performing the test.
• Maintain documentation for quality control, calibration, and
maintenance activities.
