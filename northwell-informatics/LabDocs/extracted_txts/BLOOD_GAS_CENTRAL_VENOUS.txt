STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP) FOR ANALYTICAL
PHASE OF BLOOD GAS ANALYSIS - CENTRAL VENOUS
1. PURPOSE
This procedure describes the standardized analytical process for
generating blood gas results from central venous specimens. This
ensures accurate, consistent, and timely reporting of results to assist
in medical diagnosis and treatment decisions.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel responsible for
performing blood gas analysis on central venous samples using the
ABL90 analyzer.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for adhering to this
SOP when performing blood gas analysis. It is the responsibility of
the supervisor to ensure that this SOP is followed and to address any
deviations.
4. DEFINITION
Central Venous Blood Gas Analysis: A procedure performed to
measure the amounts of gases such as oxygen and carbon dioxide in
central venous blood, along with other parameters including pH,
electrolytes, and metabolites.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• ABL90 Blood Gas Analyzer
• Blood gas syringes with lithium heparin (either low concentration
or balanced)
• Plastic specimen bags
• Personal protective equipment (PPE): Gloves, lab coat, safety
glasses
• Calibration and quality control materials
• LIS connectivity for result transmission
6. PROCEDURE
6.1 Specimen Requirements and Stability
• Collect central venous blood in a blood gas syringe containing
lithium heparin.
• Ensure the air in contact with the blood specimen is expelled, the
needle is removed, the syringe is capped, and the blood is
adequately mixed.
• The specimen should be transported to the laboratory
immediately, preferably via pneumatic tube system or by a
laboratory transportation worker.
6.2 Analytical Phase
6.2.1 Preparation and Start-up
• Check the ABL90 analyzer for calibration status and initiate
calibration if necessary.
• Ensure that the analyzer has passed internal quality control
checks. Document any failures and take corrective actions as
necessary.
• Verify that the correct correlation and validation checks have been
performed on recent solution packs or sensor cassettes.
6.2.2 Sample Analysis
• Carefully mix the blood specimen by rolling the syringe between
your palms.
• Record the specimen details in the LIS.
• Position the syringe securely in the sample inlet of the analyzer.
• Initiate the sample analysis on the ABL90.
• Monitor the analysis process for any error messages or alarms.
6.2.3 Result Interpretation
• Review the results for completeness and reliability.
• Verify the values against known physiological ranges and any
previous results for the patient.
• If encounters any “?/message code,”check and troubleshoot as
per analyzer documentation or refer to additional QC
documentation.
• If the result or sample integrity is in question, repeat the analysis if
necessary, checking for factors such as hemolysis or clot
formation.
6.2.4 Out of Range Results
• For critically high or low values, especially for potassium (K < 3.0
mmol/L or K ≥ 6.0 mmol/L), verify specimen integrity (check for
hemolysis and clotting) and re-run the test if needed. Follow
laboratory protocol for critical results reporting.
• For pO2 values <10 (code 0094:pO2 value below reportable
range), manually adjust the result in LIS to <10.
6.2.5 Quality Control and Documentation
• Compare inter-laboratory results bi-weekly and monthly as
required.
• Use the patient correlation and QC template for entering
comparison data.
• Ensure all QC logs and patient result records are up-to-date and
accurate.
6.3 Reporting Results
• Review results in the LIS and document any additional
information necessary for the interpreting clinician.
• Automatically transmit results to the LIS for final review and
verification by the technologist.
• Report critical results promptly according to the laboratory’s
critical result reporting policy.
• Document any findings related to sample integrity concerns and
any critical results communicated.
6.4 Clean-up and Maintenance
• Dispose of used syringes and biohazard materials according to
lab safety protocols.
• Clean and prepare the analyzer for the next use, following the
manufacturer's maintenance guidelines.
• Record and report any maintenance issues to the supervisor for
further action.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Refer to the QC section of this SOP for frequent quality control
checks, including bi-weekly, monthly, and with each new lot of
reagents.
