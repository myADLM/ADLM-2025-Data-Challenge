Title: Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Blood Gas - Cord Arterial
1. PURPOSE
This SOP provides a detailed guideline for the blood gas analysis of
cord arterial blood samples to ensure accurate and reliable results
are achieved.
Responsibility: All designated laboratory staff trained in blood gas
analysis are responsible for following this procedure correctly and
ensuring that each step is documented. Supervisors should ensure
compliance and address any issues or deviations from the
procedure.
1. DEFINITION
Cord Arterial Blood Gas: Tests measuring gases and pH in the blood
of an artery drawn from the umbilical cord of a newborn.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Requirements and Handling:
1. Specimen Collection:
◦ Cord arterial blood must be collected using a Safe Pico
syringe or an equivalent syringe specifically designed for
blood gas analysis.
◦ Ensure that the blood sample does not contain air bubbles
and expel any present air from the syringe.
◦ Firmly cap the syringe after removing the needle.
2. Sample Transport:
◦ Transport the specimen to the laboratory immediately after
collection.
◦ If transportation by pneumatic tube is not feasible, a
transportation worker should deliver the labeled specimen in
a sealed plastic bag for immediate analysis.
3. Unacceptable Specimens:
◦ Specimens with significant air bubbles (>10%)
◦ Specimens with attached needles
◦ Clotted specimens
◦ Specimens collected with an inappropriate anticoagulant
such as sodium citrate, sodium fluoride/oxalate, or EDTA
B. Analytical Procedure:
1. Instrument Preparation:
◦ Ensure the ABL90 Blood Gas Analyzer is calibrated and
within acceptable QC limits before starting sample analysis.
◦ Verify that the solution pack and sensor cassette are
functioning correctly.
2. Sample Analysis:
◦ Mix the blood sample thoroughly by inversion prior to
analysis.
◦ Aspirate the sample into the analyzer following the
manufacturer’s operating instructions.
◦ Ensure the entire sample is aspirated and bubbles are not
present during analysis.
3. Reviewing and Reporting Results:
◦ Monitor the instrument display for any error messages or “?”
marks and address issues following troubleshooting
guidelines.
◦ After the analysis, review the results automatically
transmitted to the LIS.
◦ Critical results should be handled immediately following the
laboratory's policy for critical results.
4. Interpretation of Results:
◦ For pO2 values below the reportable range (<10 mmHg),
type any number below 10 to adjust and automate reporting
"<10" in the LIS.
◦ Calculated results such as HCO3 and Base Excess (BE)
should be reviewed, particularly if pCO2 exceeds 110
mmHg. Use appropriate mnemonic to remove and comment
on unavailable results.
C. Quality Control: - Perform bi-weekly and monthly intralab
comparisons of blood gas samples as documented. - Verify internal
quality control runs as per the automated schedule on the ABL90
analyzer. - Document QC activities and any corrective actions
required.
D. Sample Integrity Assessment: - If the sample integrity is
questionable, centrifuge a small aliquot and check for issues (e.g.,
hemolysis). - If determined to be compromised, use best judgment in
reporting results or solicit advice from the on-call supervisor.
