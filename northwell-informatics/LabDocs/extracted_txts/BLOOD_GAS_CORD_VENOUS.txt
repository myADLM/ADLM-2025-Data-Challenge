Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Blood Gas, Cord
Venous Analysis
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to detail the procedure for the accurate
analysis and reporting of blood gas from cord venous samples. This
ensures consistency, reliability, and validity of results generated
within our CLIA-certified laboratory.
Responsibility:
All laboratory personnel processing and analyzing cord venous blood
gas specimens.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen Type:
• Cord venous blood
Collection:
• Use Safe Pico syringes containing electrolyte-balanced heparin
(80 IU/L) and a gold-plated mixing ball to reduce clot formation.
• Ensure proper mixing to prevent clotting.
Handling:
• Expel air in contact with the blood specimen immediately after
collection.
• Remove the needle and cap the syringe securely.
• Adequately mix the sample by gently rotating or inverting the
syringe.
Transport:
• Transport to the lab immediately using the pneumatic tube system
or by a transportation worker, ensuring the sample is in a plastic
bag.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens with needles attached.
• Specimens with significant (>10%) air bubbles.
• Clotted specimens.
• Specimens in sodium citrate, sodium fluoride/oxalate, or EDTA.
• Specimens in evacuated blood collection tubes (e.g., Vacutainers
or Microtainers).
3. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
Equipment:
• ABL 90 Blood Gas Analyzer
• Pneumatic tube system
Reagents:
• Electrolyte-balanced heparinized syringes
• Gold-plated mixing ball
4. QUALITY CONTROL
Daily QC:
• Three levels of quality control materials are automatically
analyzed on the ABL 90 according to a set schedule. Limits set by
the vendor are verified for acceptance.
• If QC fails for any analyte, the instrument will not provide a result
for that analyte.
Bi-Weekly QC:
• Analyze >1 ml of sample using ABL 90, then aliquot into 2 tubes,
0.5 ml each.
Monthly QC:
• Analyze >1 ml of sample on ABL analyzers in both ICU/NICU and
the lab.
5. ANALYTICAL PROCEDURE
Specimen Preparation:
• Ensure the blood sample is well-mixed and free from clots or air
bubbles before analysis.
Instrument Calibration:
• Ensure that the ABL 90 blood gas analyzer is properly calibrated
and has passed QC checks before use.
Sample Analysis:
• Insert the heparinized syringe into the ABL 90 blood gas analyzer.
• Follow the instrument prompts to complete the analysis.
• Monitor the instrument for any error messages and perform
troubleshooting as needed.
Record Results:
• Results are automatically transmitted to the Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
• Review and verify the results for accuracy.
6. TROUBLESHOOTING
Errors and Message Codes:
• Review error messages on the ABL 90 printout and follow the
instrument's troubleshooting guide.
• If message codes persist, reanalyze the sample on another
analyzer if available.
• If the issue persists, report with "No Value" and document the
reason.
Temperature Handling:
• All refrigerated supplies should be brought to room temperature
before analysis.
• Ensure ambient laboratory conditions are within the specified
ranges for optimal instrument performance.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
Verification:
• Technologists must review and verify results before releasing
them from the LIS.
Critical Results:
• Critical results must be reported immediately following laboratory
protocol.
• Ensure repeat critical values are verified and properly
documented.
