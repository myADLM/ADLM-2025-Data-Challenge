STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP)
1. PURPOSE:
The purpose of this SOP is to ensure the accurate, reliable, and
timely processing, analysis, and reporting of blood gas and
pulmonary artery samples in a CLIA-certified laboratory. This
procedure outlines the steps for the analytical phase of generating
results for blood gas and pulmonary artery specimens.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the
analysis, monitoring the equipment, and ensuring proper
documentation as defined in this procedure.
2. DEFINITION:
Blood gas analysis includes the measurement of pH, partial
pressures of oxygen (pO2), and carbon dioxide (pCO2), as well as
other calculated parameters such as bicarbonate (HCO3) and base
excess (BE).
Pulmonary artery analysis involves measuring gases and electrolytes
within blood samples collected from the pulmonary artery, providing
critical information about the patient's respiratory and metabolic
status.
3. PROCEDURE:
3.1 Specimen Requirements and Stability:
• Pulmonary artery blood sample: collected using a heparinized
syringe (lithium or balanced heparin preferred).
• Ensure the sample is free of clots and air bubbles; expel any air in
contact with the blood before capping the syringe.
• Transport the sample to the lab immediately after collection to
maintain integrity.
3.2 Equipment and Reagents:
• ABL90 Blood Gas Analyzer or an equivalent analyzer pre-
calibrated and maintained according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
• Quality control materials (3 levels: low, normal, high).
• Calibration gases/supplies as provided by the manufacturer.
• Alcohol wipes for sterilization.
• Heparinized syringes in case of emergency supply issues.
3.3 Analysis Process:
3.3.1 Pre-analysis Checks:
• Ensure all required reagents and supplies are available and not
expired.
• Check the analyzer’s calibration status; recalibrate if necessary.
• Verify the analyzer is within acceptable quality control parameters
before running patient samples.
3.3.2 Sample Preparation:
• Gently invert or roll the capped syringe to ensure thorough mixing
without introducing bubbles.
• For capillary samples, mix immediately after collection by rolling
between outstretched palms for at least 5 seconds.
• For arterial, venous, or mixed venous samples, ensure samples
are adequately mixed and air-free before analysis.
3.3.3 Instrument Setup:
• Ensure temperature and humidity are within acceptable laboratory
limits for optimal analyzer operation.
• Set up the analyzer as per the manufacturer's instructions and
load the syringes carefully.
• Enter relevant patient information into the analyzer for accurate
result logging.
3.3.4 Running the Sample:
• Load the heparinized syringe or capillary tube into the analyzer.
• Start the analysis, ensuring that the sample is identified with
correct patient information.
• Monitor the analysis process on the analyzer screen to ensure no
errors occur.
3.4 Reporting Results:
• Check the analyzer’s displayed results for any “?” marks or error
codes.
• Cross-reference error codes with the instrument user manual and
troubleshoot as necessary.
• If unresolved errors persist, rerun the sample preferably on
another analyzer.
• Document results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
following review and verification by the technologist.
• For critical results, follow the lab’s policy for immediate notification
and documentation.
3.5 Quality Control:
• Internal quality control samples are run three times daily
(beginning, middle, and end of the workday). Record and review
results.
• Bi-weekly intra-laboratory comparisons and monthly inter-
laboratory comparisons are required.
• Upon detecting out-of-control results, take corrective actions as
per the laboratory’s quality assurance guidelines.
3.6 Post-Analysis:
• Dispose of used syringes and other materials in biomedical waste
as per the safety guidelines.
• Regularly clean and maintain the analyzer as per the
manufacturer's instructions.
• Document any deviations, errors, or troubleshooting steps
followed during the analytical process.
4. REPORTING RESULTS:
• Results are transmitted electronically to the LIS for review.
• Ensure results are reviewed and verified by trained laboratory
personnel before finalizing.
• For critical values, promptly communicate to the responsible
clinical team as per laboratory policy.
5. REFERENCES:
• Manufacturer's instructions for the ABL90 Blood Gas Analyzer.
• Laboratory Quality Assurance and Control Policy Manual.
• Relevant Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI)
guidelines.
6. ADDITIONAL NOTES:
• Always follow personal protective equipment (PPE) guidelines.
• Document all performed steps in the analysis and any corrective
actions taken in the laboratory logbook or LIS.
