Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Blood Gas Analysis -
Venous Blood
1. Purpose
To provide instructions for the analysis of venous blood gas
specimens to ensure accurate and reliable results.
2. Scope
This procedure is applicable to all venous blood gas samples
received in the laboratory for analysis.
3. Definitions
Blood Gas Analysis - Measurement of parameters such as
pH, partial pressure of oxygen (pO2), partial pressure of carbon
dioxide (pCO2), bicarbonate (HCO3), base excess (BE), and
oxygen saturation (SaO2) in blood to assess respiratory and
metabolic function.
4. Responsibilities
◦ All laboratory personnel performing blood gas analysis must
be trained and competent in this procedure.
◦ Laboratory personnel are responsible for ensuring that
quality control procedures are followed and that equipment
is maintained according to manufacturer’s guidelines.
◦ Results must be reviewed and verified by a qualified
laboratory technologist before reporting.
5. Specimen Requirements and Stability
◦ Acceptable specimens include venous blood collected in a
heparinized blood gas syringe or heparinized vacutainer
(dark green or PST).
◦ Ensure the syringe is adequately mixed to avoid clot
formation. Expel any air bubbles from the specimen.
◦ Transport the specimen to the lab immediately after
collection. For delayed transport, keep the sample on ice
and analyze within 15 minutes to prevent gas exchange with
the atmosphere.
6. Unacceptable Specimens
◦ Do not use specimens with significant air bubbles.
◦ Specimens collected in sodium citrate, sodium fluoride/
oxalate, or EDTA are unacceptable.
◦ Clotted specimens or those with a needle still attached are
not acceptable.
◦ Specimens collected in evacuated blood collection tubes
(e.g., Vacutainers or Microtainers), except in emergency
situations (full PST tube may be accepted).
7. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies
◦ ABL 90 Blood Gas Analyzer
◦ Heparinized blood gas syringes or heparinized vacutainers
(dark green or PST).
◦ Quality control materials.
◦ Ice for specimen stabilization.
8. Procedure
◦ Verify the specimen and patient information.
◦ Check the sample for integrity, absence of clots and
bubbles.
◦ Mix the sample by rolling with outstretched palms for
approximately 5 seconds.
◦ Select the appropriate analysis program on the ABL 90
analyzer.
◦ Introduce the specimen into the analyzer following the
manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Record the analysis start time.
9. Quality Control
◦ Perform quality control analysis at the beginning of each
shift and whenever a new lot of reagents or equipment is
used.
◦ Use three levels of quality control material as per
manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Enter QC results into the system and verify within
acceptable limits before proceeding with patient samples.
10. Calculation and Reporting Results
◦ Results are automatically transmitted to the LIS and
reviewed for accuracy and completeness.
◦ Results with critical values should be confirmed and
followed by departmental policies for critical value
notification.
◦ If results include questionable or unexpected values, verify
by running the sample on another analyzer or following
laboratory protocol for troubleshooting.
11. Troubleshooting and Maintenance
◦ Follow manufacturer’s instructions for routine maintenance
and calibration of the ABL 90 analyzer.
◦ Regularly check for hardware and software updates.
◦ Document any maintenance, calibration, or troubleshooting
activities.
12. References
◦ Manufacturer’s manual for ABL 90 Blood Gas Analyzer
◦ Laboratory’s Quality Assurance and Quality Control manual.
13. Appendices
◦ Quality Control Information (schedules, materials)
◦ Troubleshooting Logs and Contact Information
14. Review and Approval
◦ This SOP is reviewed annually or as changes occur in
procedures, reagents, or equipment.
◦ Approved by: [Name, Title], [Date]
This protocol ensures the consistent and reliable performance of
venous blood gas analysis, maintaining high standards in laboratory
testing and patient care.
