Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Blood Parasite Exam
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedures for conducting
blood parasite examinations in the laboratory. This procedure
ensures accurate identification and reporting of blood parasites,
critical for the diagnosis and treatment of parasitic infections.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
Qualified laboratory staff are responsible for performing the blood
parasite exam and for ensuring that results are accurate, timely, and
correctly documented. It is the responsibility of the supervisor to
ensure all laboratory staff are trained and follow this SOP.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Acceptable:
• Preferred: 2-3 mL of fresh venous blood collected in an EDTA
(lavender top) tube.
• Alternative: Blood collected in a sodium citrate or heparin tube.
Unacceptable:
• Specimens collected in tubes other than those specified.
• Clotted specimens.
• Hemolyzed specimens.
Specimen Storage:
• Blood specimens should be kept at room temperature and should
be examined as soon as possible. Delays in testing should not
exceed 6 hours from collection. If immediate examination is not
possible, store the specimen at 4°C for a maximum of 24 hours.
1. MATERIALS and EQUIPMENT
◦ Light microscope with oil immersion objectives
◦ Glass slides and coverslips
◦ Giemsa stain or Wright's stain
◦ Methanol
◦ Immersion oil
◦ Microhematocrit tubes and centrifuge (optional for thick/thin
smears)
◦ Lens paper
◦ Timer
2. PROCEDURE
Preparation of Blood Smears: A. Thin Blood Smears: 1. Place a drop
of blood approximately 1 cm from one end of a clean glass slide. 2.
Use a spreader slide held at a 30-45° angle to spread the drop of
blood quickly and smoothly to create a thin film. 3. Allow the smear to
air dry. 4. Fix the dried smear with methanol for 3-5 minutes.
B. Thick Blood Smears: 1. Place a larger drop of blood in the center
of a clean glass slide. 2. Use an applicator stick to spread the drop
into a circular area 1-2 cm in diameter. 3. Allow the smear to air dry
completely (at least 1 hour). 4. Do not fix with methanol.
Staining: A. Giemsa Stain: 1. Prepare a 1:20 dilution of Giemsa stain
with buffered water (pH 7.2). 2. Immerse smears in stain for 20-30
minutes. 3. Rinse gently with buffered water. 4. Allow slides to air dry
in a vertical position.
1. EXAMINATION AND INTERPRETATION
A. Use a light microscope with 100x oil immersion objective. B.
Examine the thin smear first:
1. Scan the entire smear systematically.
2. Identify and document the presence, species, and stages
of any parasites found (e.g., Plasmodium species,
Trypanosoma species, Babesia species).
3. Quantify parasitemia as necessary (parasites per
microliter).
C. Then examine the thick smear:
1. Scan for a minimum of 100 fields.
2. Identify and document any parasites found.
3. Note: The thick smear increases sensitivity to detect
parasites not seen on thin smears.
2. REPORTING RESULTS
A. Record findings, including:
1. Presence or absence of blood parasites.
2. Species identification (e.g., Plasmodium falciparum).
3. Stage and parasitemia (if applicable).
4. Any additional relevant observations (e.g., schizonts,
gametocytes).
B. Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
C. Phone critical results (e.g., positive for Plasmodium
falciparum) immediately to the clinician, and document the
communication in the LIS.
3. QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE
A. Perform quality control (QC) on each batch of stains and
reagents. B. Run known positive and negative control slides
weekly. C. Document QC results in the appropriate log. D. Any
QC failures must be addressed promptly, and corrections
documented.
