Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN)
Analysis in Serum
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the steps required for the analytical phase of
generating results for Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN) in serum
specimens. This ensures consistent and accurate measurement
following standardized laboratory protocols.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of all designated staff to perform the BUN
analysis according to this procedure and document all actions
including any corrective measures that may be required.
1. DEFINITION
Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN) is a measure of the amount of urea
nitrogen, a waste product formed in the liver from the breakdown of
protein, present in the blood.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Preferred/Acceptable Specimens:
• Fresh serum collected in a red-top or serum separator tube
(SST).
• Specimens should arrive in the laboratory within 48 hours of
collection if refrigerated or within 7 days if frozen.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens that are hemolyzed or lipemic.
• Specimens not properly labelled with the patient’s identification,
collection date, and time.
Specimen Stability:
• Serum specimens are stable for up to 48 hours at 2-8°C.
• Specimens are stable for up to 7 days when stored at -20°C.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Automated Chemistry Analyzer (e.g., AU680 or similar)
• Refrigerators and Freezers for specimen storage
Reagents:
• Specific reagent for BUN analysis
• Calibrators and controls provided by the reagent manufacturer
Supplies:
• Standard laboratory consumables (pipettes, test tubes,
microcentrifuge tubes, etc.)
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation:
1. Ensure all equipment is calibrated and functioning properly.
2. Verify that the reagents and controls are within their expiration
dates and prepared according to manufacturer’s instructions.
3. Prepare and label all required tubes and supplies for the
session.
B. Analysis:
1. Load serum specimens onto the automated chemistry analyzer
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Follow the specific instructions for the BUN assay provided by
the reagent manufacturer.
C. Result Interpretation:
1. Results will be automatically generated by the analyzer and
transmitted to the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
2. Review the results for any flags or errors indicating potential
issues with the specimen or analytical process.
D. Quality Control:
1. Run quality control (QC) materials as required (typically at the
beginning of the day and at regular intervals).
2. Document all QC results and ensure they fall within the
acceptable limits.
3. If QC results fall outside the acceptable limits, perform
troubleshooting as follows:
◦ Repeat the QC material.
◦ Check reagents and equipment; recalibrate if necessary.
◦ Contact the supervisor if problems persist.
4. REPORTING RESULTS
5. Verify all results including flagged results as per the analyzer’s
operating guidelines.
6. Results must be reviewed and validated by the designated
technologist before reporting.
7. Ensure the results entered into the LIS are accurate and
complete.
8. REFERENCE INTERVALS
The reference intervals for BUN in serum should be according to the
manufacturer’s guidelines or established laboratory norms:
• Normal Range: 7-20 mg/dL
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolyzed specimens may yield falsely elevated BUN results.
• Lipemic specimens may interfere with the BUN assay. Refer to
the manufacturer’s product insert for specific limitations and
troubleshooting steps.

This SOP for BUN analysis should be strictly followed to ensure
accurate and reliable results. Any deviations or issues encountered
should be reported to the laboratory supervisor immediately.
