Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Blood Work, IgE, Serum
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedures necessary for
generating accurate and reliable results for serum immunoglobulin E
(IgE) testing.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory staff including medical technologists and
laboratory assistants are responsible for performing and
documenting all steps within this protocol.
• The laboratory supervisor is responsible for ensuring adherence
to this procedure and handling any issues that arise during
testing.
1. DEFINITIONS
• Serum IgE Test: A diagnostic test that measures the level of
immunoglobulin E in the patient’s serum, used to aid in the
diagnosis of allergic disorders and other conditions.
1. PROCEDURE
Pre-analytical Phase:
• Ensure that the specimen has already been collected, received,
and accessioned correctly in accordance with the standard
protocols.
A. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies:
• Automated Immunoassay Analyzer (e.g., IMMULITE 2000)
• Serum Samples
• IgE Calibrators
• IgE Controls (Low, Medium, High)
• Diluent
• Tips, Tubes, and other consumables as per the manufacturer's
guidelines
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) (e.g., gloves, lab coat)
B. Calibration:
• Perform calibration on the analyzer following the manufacturer's
instructions.
• Use the IgE Calibrators provided by the manufacturer.
• Record calibration results in the appropriate logbook.
• Ensure that calibration meets the predetermined acceptance
criteria before proceeding with patient samples.
C. Quality Control:
• Run quality control samples (Low, Medium, High) at the start of
each testing batch.
• Document QC results and verify that they fall within the
manufacturer's established ranges.
• If QC results are out of range, troubleshoot according to the
analyzer's manual, and do not proceed with patient samples until
QC results are acceptable.
D. Sample Analysis:
1. Preparation:
◦ Use serum separator tubes (SST) or plain red-top tubes.
◦ Serum samples should be free from hemolysis, lipemia, and
icterus. If present, flag samples for review and possible
rejection.
2. Sample Loading:
◦ Ensure samples are uniformly mixed prior to analysis.
◦ Load serum samples, controls, and calibrators into the
analyzer according to the manufacturer's guidelines.
3. Running the Test:
◦ Program the automated analyzer for IgE testing.
◦ Verify that the instrument settings and assay parameters are
correctly configured.
◦ Start the analysis and allow the instrument to process
samples.
E. Result Validation:
• Review generated results ensuring alignment with expected
standards.
• Flag and review results exceeding reference intervals or if any
error codes arise during the process.
• Validate results for each patient ensuring that the calibration
curves and quality controls were acceptable.
1. Reporting Results:
• Document the validated IgE results in the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
• Verify accuracy and coherence before releasing the results.
• Reference intervals:
◦ Total IgE: < 150 kU/L for adults and age-related reference
ranges for pediatric populations.
1. Method Limitations:
• As specified in the instrument's operation manual, possibly
including issues related to interfering substances in serum.
• Not suitable for hemolytic, icteric, or lipid-laden samples.
1. Critical Values and Alert Notification:
• Define any critical threshold values for IgE specific to patient
safety and notify the referring healthcare provider immediately
following standard critical result communication protocols.
1. Maintenance and Troubleshooting:
• Routine maintenance of the analyzer should be performed as per
the manufacturer's guidelines.
• Document maintenance and any troubleshooting steps taken in
the instrument log.
1. Safety and Waste Management:
• Follow standard laboratory safety practices.
• Use appropriate PPE throughout the procedure.
• Dispose of all waste, including biological and chemical waste, in
accordance with biohazard regulations.
1. References:
• Manufacturer's User Manual for the specific Analyzer (e.g.,
IMMULITE 2000).
• CLSI guideline QMS20 – Quality Management for Laboratory
Services.
This SOP should be reviewed and updated as necessary to ensure
compliance with the latest standards and regulations applicable until
October 2023.
