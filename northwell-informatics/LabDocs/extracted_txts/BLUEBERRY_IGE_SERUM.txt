Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Analytical Phase:
Generating Results for BLUEBERRY IgE, Serum
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for the analysis and reporting of Blueberry-
specific Immunoglobulin E (IgE) in serum samples to ensure
accuracy, consistency, and compliance with regulatory standards.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel responsible for
performing and reporting blueberry-specific IgE serum assays.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of qualified laboratory personnel to follow this
procedure and to ensure that all steps are accurately performed and
documented. Supervisors are responsible for reviewing and verifying
results prior to reporting.
4. DEFINITION
Blueberry IgE serum test measures the level of IgE antibodies
specific to blueberry allergens in the patient's serum.
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type: Serum Volume Required: Minimum 1 mL Storage:
• Refrigeration (2-8°C) for up to 7 days.
• Freeze (-20°C) for long-term storage.
Rejection Criteria:
• Specimen received more than 7 days after collection without
freezing.
• Grossly hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric specimens.
• Specimens with insufficient volume.
6. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
• Automated immunoassay analyzer (e.g., ImmunoCAP, HyTEC or
equivalent)
• Standard laboratory pipettes and tips
• Centrifuge
• Serum tubes
• Properly calibrated traceable thermometers
• Reagent kits specific for Blueberry IgE (ensure the expiration date
is checked)
7. QUALITY CONTROL
Internal Quality Control:
• Use control sera with low, medium, and high concentrations of
IgE.
• Run QC samples at the beginning of each batch or each day of
analysis, and document all results.
External Quality Assessment (EQA):
• Participate in proficiency testing programs at least twice per year.
• Compare and document results with peer laboratories to ensure
accuracy and precision.
8. PROCEDURE
A) Sample Preparation
1. Upon receiving the serum sample:
◦ Check integrity using the acceptance criteria listed above.
◦ Centrifuge the sample at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes if
necessary to separate serum from cells.
◦ If sample is refrigerated, ensure it reaches room
temperature before processing.
2. Aliquot the serum sample into appropriately labeled sample
cups or vials.
B) Analyzer Set-Up
1. Power on the immunoassay analyzer.
2. Perform daily maintenance and calibration as per the
manufacturer's instructions.
3. Load the Blueberry IgE reagent kit onto the analyzer.
4. Ensure that the analyzer temperature and humidity conditions
are within acceptable limits as outlined in the equipment
manual.
C) Assay Procedure
1. Load the prepared sample, required reagents, and controls into
the analyzer.
2. Follow the analyzer-specific protocol for running the Blueberry
IgE test.
3. Ensure that all validation steps are completed prior to initializing
the assay run.
4. Document the run identification number, sample, and control
positions in the work log.
D) Result Generation and Analysis
1. Upon completion of the assay, review the results generated by
the analyzer.
2. Validate the run by comparing quality control (QC) results with
the predetermined acceptable ranges.
3. If QC results fall within acceptable limits, proceed to result
interpretation:
◦ Record the IgE concentration in kU/L or class level.
4. If QC results fall outside acceptable limits, follow the
troubleshooting guide:
◦ Re-calibrate the analyzer, replace reagents if necessary,
and repeat the QC.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
Results Review and Verification:
• Technologists are responsible for the initial review and
interpretation of the results.
• Supervisors must verify the results electronically in the Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
Critical Results:
• Blueberry-specific IgE concentrations that fall within critical range
(as per laboratory policy) should be immediately reported to the
requesting healthcare provider.
10. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Blueberry IgE reference ranges:
• Negative: <0.10 kU/L
• Very Low: 0.10-0.35 kU/L
• Low: 0.35-0.70 kU/L
• Moderate: 0.70-3.50 kU/L
• High: 3.50-17.50 kU/L
• Very High: >17.50 kU/L
11. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Cross-reactivity may occur with other allergens.
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric specimens can interfere with
assays.
• Serum separation errors can affect results; always ensure
complete separation.
12. RECORD KEEPING
• Maintain records of all quality control and patient test results,
including corrective actions for out-of-range QC results.
• Ensure proper documentation of reagent lot numbers and
expiration dates.

• CLSI guidelines for allergy immunoassays.
• Manufacturer's manual for the immunoassay analyzer in use.
14. REVIEW
This SOP will be reviewed annually or whenever changes are made
to the procedure, reagents, or instrumentation.
