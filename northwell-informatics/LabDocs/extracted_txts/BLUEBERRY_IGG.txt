Standard Operating Procedure for Analytical Phase of
Generating Blueberry IgG Results
1. PURPOSE
To ensure the accurate and reliable generation of Blueberry IgG
results, including the analysis of the sample, proper documentation,
and reporting of results.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of all designated laboratory personnel to
perform and document the analysis of Blueberry IgG. Supervisors are
responsible for overseeing the process and ensuring compliance with
the protocol.
1. DEFINITION
Blueberry IgG: This test measures the level of Immunoglobulin G
specific to Blueberry antigens in the patient’s serum sample.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• ELISA reader or appropriate Immunoassay Analyzer
• Pipettes (single and multichannel)
• Microplate Washer
• Incubator (set at 37°C)
• Blueberry IgG ELISA Test Kit (includes reagents, standards, and
controls)
• Calibrated laboratory glassware
• Disposable gloves
• Biohazard disposal containers
• Appropriate PPE for laboratory staff
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Acceptable specimens: Serum or plasma (EDTA, heparin).
• Unacceptable specimens: Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
• Store samples at 2-8°C for up to 48 hours. For longer storage,
freeze samples at -20°C.
1. PROCEDURE
5.1 Preparation
• Ensure all reagents, plates, and samples are at room temperature
before starting the analysis.
• Wear appropriate PPE at all times during the assay.
5.2 Assay Procedure
1. Plate Setup:
◦ Allocate wells for standards, controls, and patient samples
in duplicates.
2. Sample and Reagent Preparation:
◦ Prepare standards and controls as instructed in the ELISA
Test Kit insert.
◦ Dilute patient samples appropriately according to the kit
instructions.
3. Assay Execution:
◦ Add the required volume of standards, controls, and diluted
samples to the designated wells.
◦ Add the Blueberry IgG-specific antibody conjugate to each
well.
◦ Incubate the plate at 37°C for the time specified in the Test
Kit insert.
◦ Wash the plate thoroughly using a microplate washer.
◦ Add the substrate solution to each well and incubate at
room temperature in the dark for the specified time.
◦ Add the stop solution to each well.
4. Reading the Plate:
◦ Measure the absorbance at the specified wavelength using
an ELISA reader.
◦ Ensure that positive and negative controls fall within the
expected range before interpreting patient results.
5.3 Quality Control:
• Perform quality control tests with each assay run.
• Record and review QC results to ensure they meet the
established acceptance criteria.
• In the event of QC failure, troubleshoot the issue, and re-run the
assay if necessary.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Calculate the concentration of Blueberry IgG in patient samples
using the standard curve generated from the assay.
• Verify and review results for accuracy and consistency. Document
any corrections or comments.
• Validate results according to laboratory protocol and enter them
into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Ensure critical results are promptly communicated to the relevant
healthcare provider.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Define the normal and abnormal ranges based on the kit
instructions and established reference ranges for the laboratory.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Detail any potential interferences or limitations as described in the
Test Kit insert.
• Ensure that any limitations are clearly noted in the patient report if
applicable.
1. DOCUMENTATION AND RECORD-KEEPING
• Maintain thorough documentation of all steps, including
preparation, assay execution, and result analysis.
• Store QC results and all relevant data as per laboratory policy.
