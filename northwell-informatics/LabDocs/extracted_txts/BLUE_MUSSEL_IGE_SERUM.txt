Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analysis of Blue
Mussel, IgE, Serum
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the analytical procedures for the
measurement of Blue Mussel-specific Immunoglobulin E (IgE) in
serum using an automated Immunoassay Analyzer. This protocol
ensures accurate, reproducible, and reliable results.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel performing the
analysis of Blue Mussel-specific IgE in serum samples.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Laboratory Technologists: Responsible for performing the
analysis according to this SOP.
• Supervisors: Responsible for ensuring that all technologists are
trained and competent in this procedure.
• Laboratory Manager: Responsible for overseeing the
implementation and compliance of this SOP.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Sample Type: Serum
• Specimen Collection: Collect blood in a serum separator tube
(SST). Allow the blood to clot at room temperature for 30 minutes
and centrifuge at 1500 g for 15 minutes to obtain serum.
• Specimen Handling: Avoid hemolysis of the specimen. Store
serum samples at 2-8°C for up to 48 hours. For longer storage,
keep specimens at -20°C or below.
• Unacceptable Specimens: Specimens with visible hemolysis,
lipemia, or icterus. Specimens not stored or handled properly.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Automated Immunoassay Analyzer
• Blue Mussel-specific IgE Reagents Kit
• Quality control materials (low, medium, high)
• Calibrators specific to Blue Mussel IgE assay
• Disposable pipette tips
• Lab coat, gloves, and other appropriate personal protective
equipment (PPE)
6. PROCEDURE
6.1 Calibration:
1. Ensure the analyzer is properly calibrated using Blue Mussel
IgE calibrators.
2. Follow manufacturer’s instructions for loading and running
calibrators.
3. Record calibration results and ensure they fall within acceptable
ranges before proceeding with specimen testing.
6.2 Quality Control:
1. Prepare and run quality control (QC) materials at low, medium,
and high levels through the analyzer.
2. Verify that QC results are within specified limits before
analyzing patient specimens.
3. Document QC results and take corrective actions if QC results
are out of range.
6.3 Specimen Analysis:
1. Set up the automated Immunoassay Analyzer according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
2. Ensure the analyzer is in the correct operational mode for IgE
analysis.
3. Load patient serum samples onto the analyzer, ensuring
sample IDs correspond to the order list.
4. Initiate analysis and monitor the run for any errors or issues.
5. Document any issues that arise and take appropriate actions as
per manufacturer's guidelines.
6.4 Post-Analysis Procedures:
1. Review results for all patient samples.
2. Verify results for consistency and accuracy. Investigate and
resolve any discrepancies.
3. Report results according to lab policy. Utilize the Laboratory
Information System (LIS) to ensure accurate and timely
reporting.
4. If critical results are obtained, follow the laboratory's critical
results protocol, including verification and timely communication
to the requesting physician.
7. ANALYTICAL LIMITATIONS
• Refer to the reagent kit insert for specific limitations of the Blue
Mussel-specific IgE assay.
• Factors such as the patient’s physiological condition, specimen
handling, and storage conditions can affect results.
8. QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE
• Incorporate regular instrument maintenance and validations to
ensure the analyzer is functioning optimally.
• Participate in external proficiency testing to validate testing
accuracy and precision.
• Maintain records of all QC, calibration, and maintenance logs.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results are to be transmitted automatically to the LIS and must be
reviewed and verified by the technologist.
• Reference Intervals: Utilize manufacturer-provided reference
ranges, ensuring they are reviewed and validated for the specific
patient population.
• Critical Results: Report and document following the laboratory’s
established critical result communication policy.
10. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's manual and reagent kit inserts for the
Immunoassay Analyzer.
• Laboratory's internal SOPs for quality control, maintenance, and
critical results handling.
11. DOCUMENTATION
• Record all calibration, QC results, patient results, and
maintenance logs in the appropriate formats.
• Ensure all records are maintained according to laboratory policies
and regulatory requirements for audit purposes.
