STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase: BOB-1 Immunostain, Technical Component
Only
1. PURPOSE
This protocol describes the procedure for performing technical
components of BOB-1 immunostaining in the laboratory, ensuring
consistent and reliable results.
Responsibility:
All designated laboratory technologists are responsible for performing
the procedure as outlined and for maintaining documentation.
Supervisors are responsible for ensuring adherence to the
procedure, overseeing the quality control, and troubleshooting any
issues that arise during the process.
1. DEFINITION
BOB-1 (B cell Oct-binding protein 1) is an immunohistochemical
marker used in the diagnosis and study of B-cell lymphomas and
multiple myeloma. This procedure details the technical component of
staining tissue sections with BOB-1 and does not include
interpretation of the results.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
3.1 Acceptable specimens: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded
(FFPE) tissue sections. 3.2 Unacceptable specimens: Samples that
are poorly fixed, inadequately processed, or have insufficient tissue
for the required test.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
4.1 Equipment:
• Microtome
• Water bath
• Heat block or incubator (37°C)
• Incubator (60°C)
• Timer
• Humidity chamber
4.2 Reagents and Supplies:
• BOB-1 primary antibody
• Secondary antibody (e.g., biotinylated or HRP-conjugated)
• Detection system (e.g., DAB, AEC)
• Antigen retrieval solution (e.g., Citrate buffer, pH 6.0)
• Tris-buffered saline (TBS) or Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)
• Hematoxylin
• Mounting medium (e.g., DPX, aqueous)
1. PROCEDURE
5.1 Preparation of Tissue Sections:
• Use a microtome to cut 4 µm sections of FFPE tissue.
• Float the sections on a water bath at approximately 40°C and
mount onto positively charged glass slides.
• Allow sections to dry overnight at room temperature or incubate at
60°C for 1 hour.
5.2 Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
• Dewax sections in xylene (2 changes, 5 minutes each).
• Rehydrate through graded alcohols (100%, 90%, 80%, 70%, and
distilled water, 2 minutes each).
5.3 Antigen Retrieval:
• Heat retrieval solution (Citrate buffer, pH 6.0) to 95-98°C.
• Immerse the slides in the retrieval solution and incubate for 20
minutes.
• Cool the slides to room temperature in the same solution for 20
minutes.
5.4 Blocking:
• Apply a peroxidase block (e.g., 3% H2O2 in methanol) and
incubate for 10 minutes to quench endogenous peroxidase
activity.
• Rinse with TBS or PBS.
5.5 Primary Antibody Incubation:
• Apply the BOB-1 primary antibody, diluted as per manufacturer's
instructions, to the sections.
• Incubate in a humidity chamber at 37°C for 1 hour or at 4°C
overnight.
5.6 Secondary Antibody Incubation:
• Rinse sections with TBS or PBS.
• Apply a secondary antibody (e.g., biotinylated or HRP-
conjugated) and incubate for 30 minutes at room temperature.
5.7 Detection:
• Rinse sections with TBS or PBS.
• Apply the detection system (e.g., DAB substrate) and incubate for
5-10 minutes or until desired stain intensity is reached.
• Rinse sections with distilled water.
5.8 Counterstaining:
• Counterstain with hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes.
• Rinse sections with running tap water for bluing.
5.9 Mounting:
• Dehydrate through graded alcohols (70%, 80%, 90%, 100%) and
clear in xylene.
• Apply mounting medium and coverslip.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
6.1 Control Slides:
• Include a positive control slide known to express BOB-1.
• Include a negative control slide where the primary antibody is
replaced by an appropriate isotype control or buffer.
6.2 Validation:
• Ensure current primary antibody lot is validated before use.
• Document all control results in the quality control log and
troubleshoot any discrepancies.
6.3 Documentation:
• Record the batch number of antibodies, reagents used, incubation
times, and any deviations from the protocol.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Only the technical component is performed under this SOP.
• Deliver stained slides to the pathologist for evaluation and
interpretation.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING
8.1 Weak Staining:
• Verify primary antibody concentration and incubation times.
• Check antigen retrieval procedure.
• Ensure slides are properly deparaffinized and rehydrated.
8.2 Non-specific Staining:
• Optimize blocking steps.
• Ensure thorough washing between steps.
• Dilute the primary antibody further if needed.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions for the BOB-1 primary antibody.
• Relevant literature on BOB-1 immunostaining techniques.
1. REVISION HISTORY
• This section is updated each time the SOP is revised, including
revision number, date, and brief description of the change.
