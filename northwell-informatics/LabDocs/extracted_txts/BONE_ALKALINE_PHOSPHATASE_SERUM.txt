Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Measurement of
Bone Alkaline Phosphatase (B-ALP) in Serum
1. PURPOSE
This document outlines the procedures for the measurement of Bone
Alkaline Phosphatase (B-ALP) in serum. The measurement of B-ALP
in serum is performed to assess bone-related disorders such as
osteomalacia, Paget's disease, and osteoporosis.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the laboratory technologist to follow the
procedures outlined in this document to ensure accurate and reliable
results.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type:
• Serum is the preferred specimen for B-ALP measurement.
*Collection:
• Blood should be collected in a serum separator tube (SST).
• Allow the blood to clot at room temperature for 15-30 minutes.
• Centrifuge the specimen at 1500-2000 x g for 10-15 minutes to
separate the serum.
• Avoid hemolysis and ensure the absence of fibrin clots and red
blood cells.
Specimen Stability:
• Serum may be stored at 2-8°C for up to 7 days.
• For long-term storage, serum should be aliquoted and frozen at
-20°C or lower. Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Automated chemistry analyzer (e.g., Roche Cobas, Beckman
Coulter AU series)
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes and pipette tips
Reagents:
• B-ALP reagent kits specific to the chemistry analyzer being used.
(Consult the reagent package insert for specific details.)
• Quality control materials (low, medium, and high levels)
Supplies:
• Serum separator tubes (SST)
• Disposable gloves
• Clean sample cups
5. QUALITY CONTROL
Control Material:
• Use commercial control materials with known concentrations of B-
ALP.
• Run quality control samples at the beginning of each shift, with
each batch of patient samples, and after any maintenance or
calibration of the analyzer.
Procedure:
1. Prepare control materials according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
2. Run control materials according to the analyzer’s operational
procedures.
3. Accept results if they fall within the established control ranges.
If controls are out of range, troubleshoot according to the
laboratory’s quality control protocols before proceeding with
patient samples.
6. PROCEDURE
Calibration:
1. Calibrate the analyzer using the calibration standards provided
by the reagent manufacturer.
2. Follow the analyzer’s calibration procedures as outlined in the
analyzer’s operation manual.
Sample Analysis:
1. Ensure the serum samples are at room temperature and
properly mixed.
2. Load serum samples into sample cups or onto the analyzer’s
sample rack according to the manufacturer's instructions.
3. Input patient identification and test request into the analyzer’s
LIS (Laboratory Information System) or manually into the
analyzer.
4. Select the appropriate assay for B-ALP.
5. Initiate the analysis according to the analyzer's operating
instructions.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
Automatic Result Transmission:
• Results are automatically transmitted to the LIS after analysis.
• Technologists must review and verify results before releasing
them to the ordering physicians.
Reference Intervals:
• Reference intervals for B-ALP may vary by laboratory. Common
reference ranges are typically provided in the reagent insert and
should be validated by the laboratory.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Interferences:
• Hemolysis, lipemia, and icterus may interfere with the B-ALP
assay.
• Ensure samples have minimal interference before analysis.
Technical Limits:
• Refer to the reagent insert and analyzer operation manual for
specific limitations related to the assay.
9. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If the analyzer flags a sample or control is out of range,
troubleshoot per the manufacturer's instructions and laboratory
protocols.
• Follow established protocols for recalibration or maintenance if
necessary.
