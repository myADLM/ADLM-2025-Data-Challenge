Title: Analytical Phase Standard Operating Procedure for Generating
Results for Bone Histomorphometry Consultant Interpretation, Slides
Only
1. PURPOSE
To provide a detailed and standardized procedure for the analysis,
interpretation, and reporting of bone histomorphometry slides
submitted for consultant interpretation, ensuring high-quality and
accurate results.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all bone histomorphometry slides received
for consultant interpretation in the laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Trained laboratory technologists: Responsible for preparing the
slides, performing the measurements, and recording the initial
data.
• Consultants (Pathologists): Responsible for the interpretation of
the histomorphometric data and generating the final report.
• Laboratory Manager/Supervisor: Ensures adherence to the SOP
and addresses any irregularities in the process.
4. MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT
• Bone histomorphometry slides
• Calibrated microscope with an eyepiece reticle or digital imaging
system with measurement software
• Documentation forms (digital or paper-based) for recording
observations and results
• Case tracking system/Laboratory Information System (LIS)
• PPE (personal protective equipment)
5. DEFINITIONS AND ABBREVIATIONS
• Histomorphometry: Quantitative analysis of bone
microarchitecture and remodeling.
• LIS: Laboratory Information System used for tracking and
documentation.
• PPE: Personal Protective Equipment.
6. PROCEDURES
A. Slide Reception and Initial Handling
1. Verify that slides are correctly labeled with patient identification
and accession numbers.
2. Cross-check the slides against the lab requisition form to
ensure consistency.
3. Log the receipt of slides into the LIS, noting the date and time
of receipt.
B. Slide Preparation
1. Ensure that the microscope and measurement software are
correctly calibrated.
2. Use personal protective equipment (PPE) including gloves, lab
coat, and eye protection.
3. Place the slides in the order specified by the requisition form for
systematic analysis.
C. Measurement and Analysis
1. Microscopically examine the slides to ensure adequacy of
sample and staining quality.
◦ Note and document any issues with sample quality or
staining.
2. Perform histomorphometric measurements using the calibrated
microscope or digital imaging system.
◦ Metrics to be measured may include bone volume/total
volume (BV/TV), osteoid thickness, trabecular separation,
osteoclast number, etc.
◦ Refer to standard histomorphometric guidelines for specific
measurement protocols.
3. Record all measurements accurately in the designated format,
including any observations pertinent to the sample.
D. Quality Control
1. Each technologist is required to cross-check their
measurements with another trained technologist or supervisor
to ensure accuracy.
2. Document any discrepancies found during the cross-check and
resolve them before proceeding.
E. Data Review and Consultant Interpretation
1. Prepare a summary report of the measurements and
annotations, ensuring all documentation is complete and
accurate.
2. Submit the summary report and slides to the consulting
pathologist for interpretation.
3. The consultant will review the measurements, perform
additional analyses if needed, and provide a detailed
interpretation of the findings.
4. The consultant's interpretation, conclusions, and
recommendations are documented in the final report.
F. Reporting Results
1. The final interpreted report will be reviewed and signed off by
the consultant.
2. Transcribe the final report into the LIS, ensuring all patient
identifying information is accurate.
3. File the original documentation as per laboratory policy and
create a digital copy if required.
G. Result Distribution
1. Send the final validated results to the clinician or requesting
department as per established protocols.
2. Ensure confidentiality and data security during transmission
and storage of patient results.
7. TRAINING REQUIREMENTS
• All laboratory personnel performing bone histomorphometry must
undergo specific training in histological measurement techniques
and the use of relevant equipment.
• Regular competency assessments must be conducted to ensure
adherence to the protocol.
8. RECORDS AND DOCUMENTATION
• Maintain comprehensive records of all measurements,
interpretations, and reports.
• Ensure documentation is compliant with regulatory standards and
laboratory policies.
• Store all documentation securely for the required retention period.
9. REFERENCES
• Relevant histomorphometric guidelines and protocols.
• Manufacturer manuals for histomorphometry equipment.
• Laboratory safety and quality assurance protocols.
10. REVIEW AND UPDATE
This SOP shall be reviewed annually or as required based on
changes in protocols, equipment updates, or regulatory
requirements.
