Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Bone
Histomorphometry Analysis
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedures for the analytical phase of generating
results for bone histomorphometry, including gross microscopic
examination.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all staff involved in the analysis and
reporting of bone histomorphometry results within the laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing and
documenting all steps outlined in this procedure. Supervisors are
responsible for ensuring adherence to these procedures, as well as
validating and reporting results.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimens: Fresh or fixed bone samples (typically iliac crest
biopsy). Specimens must be properly labeled with patient
identification and collection date/time.
• Fixatives: Depending on the protocol, specimens may be fixed
using buffered formalin, ethanol, or specific bone fixatives.
• Unacceptable Specimens: Specimens that are improperly labeled,
do not meet collection requirements, or are significantly damaged
affecting the analysis.
5. MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT
• Microtome
• Cryostat (if required for frozen sections)
• Glass slides
• Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining reagents
• Goldner's trichrome staining reagents (optional for undecalcified
sections)
• Light microscope
• Image analysis software
• Bone-specific embedding media (e.g., methyl methacrylate)
6. PROCEDURES
A) Specimen Processing:
1. Fixation:
◦ Place bone specimens in appropriate fixative immediately
upon receipt. Ensure complete immersion. Fixation time
depends on the fixative used (typically 24-48 hours for
formalin).
2. Decalcification (if required):
◦ Decalcify bone specimens using buffered EDTA or a
commercially available decalcifying agent. Monitor
decalcification progress regularly.
3. Embedding:
◦ For undecalcified sections, embed specimens in methyl
methacrylate following standard protocols.
◦ For decalcified sections, embed specimens in paraffin wax
using standard histological procedures.
B) Sectioning:
1. Microtome Sectioning:
◦ Trim embedded specimens using a microtome. Adjust
settings to ensure optimal thickness (typically 4-6 microns
for paraffin sections, can be thinner for plastic embedded
sections).
2. Cryostat Sectioning: (Optional for frozen sections)
◦ If frozen sectioning is required, use a cryostat to section
specimens at desired thickness (generally around 10
microns).
C) Staining:
1. Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) Staining:
◦ Perform standard H&E staining on selected sections
following established protocols.
2. Special Stains:
◦ Perform additional stains as required, such as Goldner’s
trichrome for undecalcified sections to visualize bone matrix
and cellular components.
D) Microscopic Examination:
1. Gross Examination:
◦ Perform gross examination using a light microscope.
Evaluate histological features including bone trabeculae,
osteoid, cellularity, and any pathological changes.
2. Quantitative Analysis:
◦ Use image analysis software for quantitative assessment of
histomorphometric parameters such as bone volume,
osteoid volume, osteoblast/osteoclast activity, and
mineralization rates.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Ensure all reagents and equipment are properly maintained and
within expiry dates.
• Monitor staining quality and consistency. Perform regular
calibration and maintenance of microscopes and imaging
software.
• Run quality control slides with known histomorphometric values
with each batch of stained slides.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Document all histomorphometric findings comprehensively.
• Review and validate results through supervisory personnel.
• Results must be verified before reporting. Ensure all data is
entered accurately into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Ensure appropriate fixation and decalcification techniques.
Improper methods can lead to degradation and artifact creation.
• Variability in staining can impact quantitative analysis, ensure
consistency in staining protocols.
10. REFERENCES
• Detailed procedural information and best practices can be found
in relevant histological textbooks and scholarly articles on bone
histomorphometry.
• Manufacturer instructions for specialized staining kits and
embedding media.
11. REVISIONS
• SOP will be reviewed annually and updated as necessary to
reflect changes in protocols, reagents, and equipment.
