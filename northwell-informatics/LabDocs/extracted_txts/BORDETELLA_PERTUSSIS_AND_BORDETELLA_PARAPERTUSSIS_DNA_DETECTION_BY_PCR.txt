Standard Operating Procedure for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for BORDETELLA PERTUSSIS AND
BORDETELLA PARAPERTUSSIS DNA DETECTION BY PCR
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedure for the analytical
phase of detecting Bordetella pertussis and Bordetella parapertussis
DNA by PCR. This procedure ensures accurate, reliable, and timely
results for patient diagnosis and treatment.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the qualified laboratory personnel to perform
the PCR analysis according to this SOP. All staff involved in the
procedure must adhere to the specified protocols to maintain the
integrity of the results.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/acceptable specimens:
• Nasopharyngeal swabs in Universal Transport Medium (UTM) or
equivalent, collected and transported to the lab as per the
Standard Collection Procedure.
Unacceptable specimens:
• Specimens not properly labeled.
• Specimens not transported under appropriate conditions.
• Specimens contaminated, leaked, or in non-approved transport
media.
• Specimens arriving at the laboratory more than 72 hours post-
collection.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• PCR workstation.
• Microcentrifuge.
• Vortex mixer.
• Thermal Cycler.
• 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes.
• PCR reagents: Master Mix (containing Taq polymerase, dNTPs,
MgCl2), specific primers and probes for Bordetella pertussis and
Bordetella parapertussis DNA.
• Positive and negative controls.
• DNA extraction kit.
1. PROCEDURE
A. DNA Extraction
1. Process specimens for DNA extraction as per the
manufacturer's protocol provided with the DNA extraction kit.
2. Ensure DNA elution is into an RNase/DNase-free tube.
3. Store extracted DNA at 4°C if it is to be used within 24 hours,
otherwise, store at -20°C for longer-term storage.
B. Master Mix Preparation
1. Thaw all reagents and samples on ice before starting the
preparation.
2. Prepare the PCR Master Mix in an RNase/DNase-free
environment, according to the following proportions:
◦ 2x Master Mix
◦ Forward primer
◦ Reverse primer
◦ Probe
◦ Nuclease-free water to adjust the final volume
3. Vortex the mixture briefly and centrifuge for a few seconds to
bring the contents to the bottom of the tube.
C. PCR Setup
1. Label PCR tubes or a PCR plate with sample identifiers.
2. Aliquot 20 µL of the prepared Master Mix into each PCR tube or
well.
3. Add 5 µL of extracted DNA to each tube/well.
4. Include a positive control (known Bordetella pertussis and
Bordetella parapertussis DNA) and a negative control
(nuclease-free water) with each run.
5. Seal the tubes or plate firmly.
D. Thermal Cycling Conditions
1. Place the tubes or plate into the thermal cycler.
2. Program the thermal cycler with the following conditions:
Initial denaturation: 95°C for 10 minutes Amplification 40 cycles
of: - Denaturation: 95°C for 15 seconds - Annealing/Extension:
60°C for 1 minute
3. Start the PCR run.
E. Post-PCR Analysis
1. Upon completion of the PCR run, analyze the amplification data
using the thermal cycler’s software.
2. Determine the presence or absence of Bordetella pertussis and
Bordetella parapertussis DNA based on amplification curves
and Ct values.
3. QUALITY CONTROL
4. Confirm the successful amplification of positive control in every
run.
5. Ensure no amplification or late amplification in negative control.
6. If controls do not perform as expected, repeat the assay.
7. Document all quality control results in the Quality Control log.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
9. Interpret and verify results based on Ct values and amplification
curves.
10. Report findings as positive or negative for Bordetella pertussis
and Bordetella parapertussis DNA detection.
11. Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
following laboratory policy.
12. If results are inconclusive, re-extract DNA and repeat the PCR
assay.
13. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Positive Control Ct value range: <35
• Negative Control Ct value range: No amplification or >40
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• PCR inhibition due to contaminants in the specimen.
• Degraded DNA in improper storage/handling.
• Minimal target DNA below detection threshold.
