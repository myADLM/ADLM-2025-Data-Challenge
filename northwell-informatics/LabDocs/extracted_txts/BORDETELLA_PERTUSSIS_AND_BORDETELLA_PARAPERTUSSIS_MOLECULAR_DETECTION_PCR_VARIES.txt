Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Detection of Bordetella
pertussis and Bordetella parapertussis by Molecular Detection
(PCR)
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedural steps for the molecular detection of
Bordetella pertussis and Bordetella parapertussis using PCR
(Polymerase Chain Reaction) technology to ensure accurate and
timely results for clinical diagnosis.
2. SCOPE
This protocol applies to all laboratory personnel performing PCR
testing for Bordetella pertussis and Bordetella parapertussis.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of qualified laboratory personnel to follow this
procedure accurately. Laboratory supervisors are responsible for
ensuring that staff are trained and competent in performing the
procedures outlined in this SOP.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Acceptable specimens include nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs.
• NP swabs should be placed in sterile transport media specific for
PCR testing.
• Samples should be transported to the laboratory as quickly as
possible and stored at 2-8°C if there is a delay in testing.
5. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• PCR instrumentation (e.g., thermocycler, real-time PCR machine)
• DNA extraction kit/reagents
• Bordetella pertussis and Bordetella parapertussis specific primers
and probes
• Positive control for Bordetella pertussis and Bordetella
parapertussis
• Negative control (e.g., PCR-grade water)
• Consumables (e.g., PCR tubes, micropipettes, sterile pipette tips
with filters, lab coat, gloves)
6. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation
1. Ensure all equipment (e.g., PCR machine) is calibrated and
functioning as per manufacturer's instructions.
2. Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE)
including lab coat and gloves.
B) DNA Extraction
1. Vortex the NP swab specimen in transport medium for at least
30 seconds to ensure proper mixing.
2. Transfer the liquid to a sterile microcentrifuge tube.
3. Follow the instructions of the DNA extraction kit to isolate the
DNA from the specimen.
4. Finally, elute the DNA in a final volume according to the
extraction kit guidelines.
C) PCR Setup
1. Prepare the PCR master mix according to the manufacturer's
instructions, which generally includes the following
components:
◦ PCR buffer
◦ dNTP mix
◦ Specific primers and probes for Bordetella pertussis and
Bordetella parapertussis
◦ DNA polymerase
◦ Distilled water (to adjust the final volume)
2. Aliquot the master mix into PCR tubes or a PCR plate.
3. Add the extracted DNA (specimen) to the PCR tubes or wells of
the PCR plate containing the master mix.
4. Include negative control with water and positive controls for
Bordetella pertussis and Bordetella parapertussis.
5. Seal the tubes or plate.
D) PCR Cycling Conditions
1. Place the tubes/plate in the PCR machine.
2. Set the PCR machine to the following cycling conditions:
◦ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 10 minutes
◦ Denaturation: 95°C for 15 seconds
◦ Annealing and extension: 60°C for 1 minute Repeat
denaturation and annealing/extension steps for 40-45
cycles.
E) Post-PCR Analysis and Result Interpretation
1. Analyze the PCR data as per the software provided with the
PCR machine.
2. Positive control should show amplification for both Bordetella
pertussis and Bordetella parapertussis.
3. Negative control should show no amplification.
4. Compare the sample results to the controls:
◦ If amplification occurs within a certain cycle threshold (Ct)
range, report as positive for Bordetella pertussis or
Bordetella parapertussis depending on the probe that
fluoresces.
◦ If no amplification is within the acceptable Ct range, report
as negative.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Run controls (positive and negative) with each batch of
specimens to ensure the reliability of results.
2. Record all control results in the PCR logbook.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Document all patient results, including interpretation and
controls, in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
2. Report results to the requesting healthcare provider as per
laboratory guidelines.
9. LIMITATIONS
1. PCR inhibitors in the sample may affect the test results.
2. Specimens not processed promptly or improperly stored may
yield inaccurate results.

11. REVIEW & APPROVAL This SOP will be reviewed and approved
by the Laboratory Director and Supervisor every two years or as
required due to changes in methodology, reagents, or equipment.
