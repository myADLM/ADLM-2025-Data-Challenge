Analytical Phase SOP: BORDETELLA PERTUSSIS
ANTIBODY, IGG, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) describes the analytical
phase of testing for Bordetella pertussis antibody, IgG in serum
specimens using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The
aim is to ensure accurate and reliable results through standardized
procedures.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
Personnel conducting the test must be trained and proficient in
performing ELISA assays. It is the responsibility of the laboratory
personnel to adhere to this SOP and document all steps and
deviations.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Serum
• Volume: Minimum 1 mL
• Storage Prior to Testing: Serum specimens should be stored at
2-8°C if testing will occur within 48 hours. For longer storage,
freeze specimens at -20°C or lower.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• ELISA microtiter plate reader
• Calibrated micropipettes
• Multichannel pipette (optional)
• ELISA washer or manual washing equipment
• Incubator set at 37°C
• Bordetella pertussis IgG ELISA kit
• Distilled or deionized water
• Absorbent paper
5. REAGENT PREPARATION
1. Kit Reagents: Prepare according to manufacturer’s
instructions. Ensure reagents are brought to room temperature
(20-25°C) before use.
2. Washing Buffer: Dilute the concentrated washing buffer with
distilled or deionized water as per the provided instructions.
6. CALIBRATION AND QUALITY CONTROL
• Follow ELISA kit instructions for calibration.
• Run internal quality controls with each assay:
◦ Positive Control
◦ Negative Control
◦ Kit-provided calibrators or standards
• Control results must fall within acceptable ranges as defined by
the kit manufacturer.
7. PROCEDURE
1. Setup:
◦ Check all reagents and specimens are at room temperature.
◦ Label the microtiter plate with appropriate identifiers.
2. Sample and Standards Preparation:
◦ Pipette standards, controls, and diluted patient specimens
into the designated wells according to the kit instructions.
◦ Avoid air bubbles when pipetting.
3. Incubation:
◦ Incubate the plate as directed by the ELISA kit instructions,
typically at 37°C for 30-60 minutes.
4. Washing:
◦ Wash the wells thoroughly with wash buffer according to the
kit instructions. An ELISA washer may be used if available.
5. Enzyme-Conjugate Substrate Reaction:
◦ Add conjugate reagent and incubate as directed.
◦ Following incubation, wash the wells as per the protocol.
6. Substrate Addition:
◦ Add the substrate solution to each well and incubate as per
the kit instructions. Observe for color development.
7. Stopping the Reaction:
◦ Add stop solution to each well to halt the enzymatic
reaction. The stop solution will stabilize the color developed
for quantitative measurement.
8. Optical Density Measurement:
◦ Measure the absorbance for each well using an ELISA
microtiter plate reader at the appropriate wavelength
(commonly 450 nm with a reference wavelength of 620-630
nm).
8. DATA ANALYSIS AND RESULTS
• Calculations:
◦ Calculate the concentration of Bordetella pertussis IgG
antibodies in patient specimens based on the standard curve
generated from calibrators.
◦ Utilize the ELISA software or manual calculation methods as
provided by the kit manufacturer.
• Interpretation:
◦ Based on kit-specific guidelines, interpret quantitative results
as indicative of past infection, recent infection, or vaccination
status.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
• Verify results for accuracy before entering into the Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
• Indicate any sample integrity issues or deviations noted during
testing.
• Report results following the guidelines provided, including any
critical values or interpretation comments.
10. QUALITY CONTROL AND TROUBLESHOOTING
• If quality control results fall outside the acceptable range,
troubleshoot following the kit manufacturer's guidelines. Potential
steps include:
◦ Re-running controls.
◦ Checking equipment calibration.
◦ Reviewing reagent preparation.
◦ Document all troubleshooting steps and repeat testing where
necessary.

12. DOCUMENT REVISION AND APPROVAL
• All revisions of this SOP must be documented and approved by
the laboratory supervisor/manager.
• Periodic review and updates will be conducted annually or as
needed based on new guidelines or methods.
