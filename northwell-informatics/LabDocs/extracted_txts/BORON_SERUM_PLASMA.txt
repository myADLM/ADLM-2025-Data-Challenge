Standard Operating Procedure for BORON, SERUM/PLASMA
Analysis
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedures for the analysis of Boron (B) levels in
serum/plasma specimens to ensure accurate and precise
measurement, yielding reliable results.
Responsibility:
All laboratory personnel who perform Boron analysis on serum/
plasma samples are responsible for following this SOP. Laboratory
supervisors are responsible for ensuring compliance and that all
steps of the procedure are documented.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type:
• Serum
• Plasma
Collection Container:
• Serum: SST (Serum Separator Tube)
• Plasma: Lithium heparin tube (green top) without gel separator, or
EDTA tube (lavender top) without gel separator.
Specimen Volume:
• Minimum: 1 mL
• Preferred: 3 mL
Handling and Stability:
• Store specimens at 2-8°C if analysis cannot be performed
immediately, up to 5 days.
• For longer storage, aliquot and store at -20°C or lower.
• Avoid hemolysis and contamination with metal-containing tubes or
pipettes during collection and preparation.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES REQUIRED
Equipment:
• Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer (ICP-MS)
• Micropipettes and tips
• Centrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Analytical Balance
Reagents:
• Calibration standards of Boron
• Internal standard solution (such as Scandium, Germanium)
• High purity Nitric Acid (HNO3) for sample digestion
• High purity water (Type I or II)
• Quality Control (QC) materials with known Boron concentrations
Supplies:
• Polypropylene tubes
• Vial caps, labels
• Pipet tips
• Syringes
1. PROCEDURE
Preparation and Digestion:
1. Allow serum/plasma specimens to come to room temperature.
2. Mix specimens gently on a vortex mixer.
3. Aliquot 1 mL of serum or plasma into a clean polypropylene
tube.
4. Add 1 mL of high purity Nitric Acid (HNO3) to the aliquot.
5. Cap and digest the samples using a microwave digestion
system according to manufacturer instructions or a hot block
digestion method.
6. After digestion, allow the tubes to cool and then dilute the
digestate to 10 mL with high purity water.
ICP-MS Setup:
1. Calibrate the ICP-MS using Boron calibration standards
covering the expected range of concentrations.
2. Optimize the instrument parameters according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
3. Verify the calibration using a quality control material.
Sample Analysis:
1. Analyze blank, calibration standards, and QC samples to
ensure system suitability.
2. Introduce the digested serum/plasma samples into the ICP-MS.
3. Run QC samples after every ten patient samples to check for
drift and accuracy.
4. Document the Boron concentration for each sample. Report
Boron levels in µg/L.
Quality Control:
1. Include at least two levels of QC materials with each run.
2. Acceptable QC limits should be predefined (±2 standard
deviations from the mean).
3. If QC results are outside acceptable limits, identify and correct
the issue before reanalyzing affected samples.
Reporting Results:
1. Review and verify results against calibrations and QC data.
2. Report results as Boron concentration in µg/L.
3. Document any anomalies or deviations and corrective actions
taken.
1. REFERENCE RANGES
Reference intervals may vary by laboratory and should be
established based on the local population or literature values.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
2. Boron analysis is susceptible to contamination; ensure
adherence to rigorous cleanliness standards.
3. Matrix effects can influence ICP-MS analysis; matrix-matched
standards are recommended.
