Standard Operating Procedure: Analytical Phase for Borrelia
Miyamotoi Detection, PCR, Blood
1. PURPOSE
This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) outlines the step-by-step
analytical process for the detection of Borrelia miyamotoi in blood
samples using Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). This protocol
ensures that reliable, accurate, and reproducible test results are
generated under standardized conditions.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
Qualified personnel including Medical Laboratory Technologists
trained in molecular diagnostics are responsible for performing the
procedure as outlined in this SOP. It is the responsibility of the
Laboratory Supervisor to ensure that all personnel adhere to this
protocol and are properly trained.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Equipment:
◦ PCR Thermocycler
◦ Biological Safety Cabinet (Class II)
◦ Microcentrifuge
◦ Vortex Mixer
◦ Pipettes (adjustable, 0.1 µL to 1mL)
◦ Real-Time PCR Instrument, if real-time PCR is employed
• Reagents:
◦ DNA extraction kit suitable for blood samples
◦ Borrelia miyamotoi specific primers and probes
◦ PCR master mix (contains dNTPs, buffer, MgCl2, and Taq
DNA polymerase)
◦ Nuclease-free water
◦ Positive control (Borrelia miyamotoi DNA)
◦ Negative control (nuclease-free water or negative sample)
• Supplies:
◦ 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes
◦ PCR tubes/plates
◦ Tube racks
◦ Disposable gloves, lab coats, and safety glasses
4. PROCEDURE
Sample Preparation:
1. Confirm that the blood specimen has been appropriately
collected, transported, and accessioned.
2. Wear protective laboratory attire and work in a Biological Safety
Cabinet to avoid contamination.
3. Aliquot 200 µL of blood into a labeled 1.5 mL microcentrifuge
tube.
DNA Extraction:
1. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions provided with the DNA
extraction kit to isolate DNA from the blood sample.
2. Elute the DNA in 50 µL of elution buffer or nuclease-free water.
3. Store the extracted DNA at -20°C until further use if not used
immediately.
PCR Preparation:
1. Thaw all reagents on ice, including the DNA sample, primers,
probes, PCR master mix, and controls.
2. Prepare a reaction master mix according to the volumes
specified by the reagent manufacturer's protocols. Typically, this
includes:
◦ PCR master mix: 10 µL
◦ Forward primer: 0.5 µL (10 µM)
◦ Reverse primer: 0.5 µL (10 µM)
◦ Probe: 0.5 µL (10 µM)
◦ DNA template: 5 µL
◦ Nuclease-free water: up to 20 µL total reaction volume
PCR Amplification:
1. Aliquot 20 µL of the reaction mixture into individual PCR tubes
or wells of a PCR plate.
2. Include a positive control with known Borrelia miyamotoi DNA
and a negative control with nuclease-free water.
3. Seal the tubes or plate with appropriate seals or caps to
prevent contamination.
4. Place the tubes or plate into the PCR thermocycler and run the
following thermal cycling conditions:
◦ Initial Denaturation: 95°C for 3 minutes
◦ Denaturation: 95°C for 15 seconds
◦ Annealing/Extension: 60°C for 60 seconds (40 cycles)
Post-PCR Analysis:
1. Analyze the PCR products using gel electrophoresis or real-
time PCR analysis, depending on the format used.
2. For gel electrophoresis:
◦ Prepare an agarose gel.
◦ Load the PCR products alongside a DNA ladder.
◦ Run the gel and visualize the bands under UV light.
3. For real-time PCR:
◦ Analyze the amplification curves and determine the Ct
(Cycle threshold) values.
◦ Compare the patient sample results with the positive and
negative controls.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Include both positive and negative controls with each batch of
samples analyzed.
2. Verify reagent expiration dates and proper storage conditions.
3. Regularly calibrate and maintain all analytical instruments
according to the manufacturer's recommendations.
4. Document all steps, including reagent lot numbers, sample IDs,
and results in the appropriate logs.
6. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
Positive Result: Detection of Borrelia miyamotoi DNA in the patient
sample, indicated by the presence of an amplification product or a
positive signal in real-time PCR.
Negative Result: Absence of Borrelia miyamotoi DNA in the patient
sample, indicated by no amplification product or no signal in real-time
PCR, confirmed by a proper positive control result.
Invalid Result: Results indicating potential issues such as
contamination or reagent failure, necessitating repeat testing of the
sample.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
Report results according to the site-specific reporting guidelines.
Ensure that critical values are promptly communicated to the
appropriate medical personnel. Document and verify all results
before releasing.

changes in technology or laboratory practices.
END OF PROCEDURE
This comprehensive SOP aims to ensure the accurate and efficient
detection of Borrelia miyamotoi in blood samples using PCR. All
laboratory personnel must be familiar with and adhere to this protocol
