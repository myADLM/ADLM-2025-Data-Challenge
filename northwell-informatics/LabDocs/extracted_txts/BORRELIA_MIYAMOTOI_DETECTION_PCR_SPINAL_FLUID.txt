Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Borrelia Miyamotoi
Detection PCR, Spinal Fluid
1. PURPOSE
This procedure outlines the standardized method for the
detection of Borrelia miyamotoi DNA in spinal fluid (CSF)
samples using Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR).
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all qualified laboratory scientists and
technologists trained in molecular diagnostics to ensure that the
PCR procedure is performed accurately and in accordance with
this SOP. The supervisor is responsible for ensuring that all
staff are trained and competent in the procedure.
3. SAMPLE REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type:
• Preferred: 1-2 mL of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
Specimen Collection:
• CSF must be collected and handled using sterile techniques to
avoid contamination.
• Immediately after collection, samples should be refrigerated at
2-8°C until processing.
• If not processed within 24 hours, the sample should be frozen at
-20°C or lower.
Specimen Transport:
• Samples should be transported to the laboratory under cold
conditions (preferably on ice packs).
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens that are not labeled properly or lack adequate
documentation.
• Hemolyzed, clotted, or visibly contaminated specimens will not be
accepted.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES Equipment:
• PCR thermocycler
• Micropipettes and filtered tips
• Centrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Biosafety cabinet
Reagents:
• DNA extraction kit (validated for CSF)
• PCR master mix (including Taq polymerase, dNTPs, MgCl2, and
buffer)
• Primers and probes specific for Borrelia miyamotoi
• Nuclease-free water
• Positive control DNA (Borrelia miyamotoi)
• Negative control (Nuclease-free water or PCR grade water)
Supplies:
• Sterile microcentrifuge tubes
• PCR tubes/plates
• Disposable gloves
• Laboratory coats
• Disinfectant wipes
1. PROCEDURE
A. DNA Extraction:
2. Thaw frozen CSF specimens at room temperature.
3. Vortex briefly and then centrifuge at 3,000 rpm for 10 minutes to
remove any cellular debris.
4. Use a specified DNA extraction kit as per the manufacturer's
instructions to isolate DNA from the CSF.
5. Label extracted DNA appropriately and store at -20°C until PCR
setup.
B. PCR Setup:
1. Thaw all reagents on ice. Vortex and briefly centrifuge before
using.
2. Prepare the PCR master mix according to the recipe:
◦ X µL of PCR master mix
◦ X µL of primers/probes mix
◦ X µL of extracted DNA sample
◦ Nuclease-free water to reach final volume
3. Set up PCR reactions in a clean hood to avoid contamination.
4. Include positive and negative controls in each run.
5. Seal the PCR tubes/plates and load them into the thermal
cycler.
C. PCR Cycling Conditions:
1. Initial denaturation: 95°C for 5 minutes
2. Denaturation: 95°C for 15 seconds
3. Annealing: 60°C for 30 seconds
4. Extension: 72°C for 30 seconds
5. Repeat steps 2-4 for 40 cycles
6. Final extension: 72°C for 5 minutes
7. Hold: 4°C until analysis
D. Post-PCR Analysis:
1. Evaluate the amplification results using the PCR thermocycler’s
software.
2. Positive sample: distinct bands or fluorescence signal indicating
Borrelia miyamotoi DNA.
3. Negative sample: no bands or fluorescence signal.
4. Record results in the laboratory information system (LIS).
5. QUALITY CONTROL:
• Include positive and negative controls in each PCR run.
• Ensure all instruments are calibrated and maintained according to
the manufacturer's guidelines.
• Document all quality control steps and corrective actions taken for
any deviations noted.
1. REPORTING RESULTS:
• Results are reviewed and verified by a qualified technologist.
• Positive results for Borrelia miyamotoi DNA should be reported
immediately to the requesting physician, with a full report entered
into the LIS.
• Negative results should be similarly recorded and reported,
stating "No Borrelia miyamotoi DNA detected in the sample."
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
• PCR may fail to detect Borrelia miyamotoi in cases of very low
bacterial load.
• Presence of PCR inhibitors in CSF could interfere with the
accurate detection of target DNA.
• Cross-contamination or improper sample handling may lead to
false-positive results.

miyamotoi.
