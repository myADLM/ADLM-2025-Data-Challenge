Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Generating Results for
Botrytis Cinerea, IgE, Serum
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to provide detailed instructions for the
analysis of Botrytis Cinerea, IgE in serum samples, ensuring
consistent, accurate, and reliable results.
1. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel involved in the
performance of the Botrytis Cinerea, IgE analysis in serum using
Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) or an equivalent
immunoassay method.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all qualified laboratory personnel to follow
this SOP strictly and to ensure that all required quality control
procedures are implemented. The laboratory supervisor is
responsible for ensuring compliance with this procedure, providing
necessary training, and addressing any deficiencies identified in the
process.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred Specimen: Serum
• Collection: Blood should be drawn into a sterile vacutainer tube
and allowed to clot.
• Handling: Centrifuge the clotted blood to separate the serum.
Aliquot the serum into labeled tubes.
• Storage: Serum samples should be stored at 2-8°C if analysis is
to be performed within 48 hours or frozen at -20°C or colder for
long-term storage.
1. REAGENTS, SUPPLIES, AND EQUIPMENT
• Botrytis Cinerea Specific IgE ELISA Kit or equivalent
immunoassay kit
◦ Reagents: Coated microtiter plates, Wash buffer, Enzyme
conjugate, Substrate solution, Stop solution, Calibrators, and
Controls.
• Precision pipettes and tips
• Plate washer (automated or manual)
• Microplate reader equipped to read at 450 nm with a reference
filter at 620-650 nm
• Incubator (37°C)
• Vortex mixer
• Centrifuge
• Timer
1. CALIBRATION AND QUALITY CONTROL
• Use only reagents and controls provided with the kit.
• Calibrators should be used to generate a standard curve for each
assay.
• Quality control (QC) sera (both positive and negative controls)
should be included in each assay run.
• Results should be accepted or rejected based on the performance
of the QC sera. If the controls fail, do not proceed with patient
results until the issue is resolved.
1. PROCEDURE
7.1. Preparation of Reagents
• Bring all reagents and samples to room temperature (18-25°C)
before use.
• Prepare wash buffer according to the kit instructions.
• Other reagents should be used directly from the kit without
additional preparation.
7.2. Assay Procedure
1. Sample preparation:
◦ Dilute serum samples as per the manufacturer's
instructions.
◦ Thoroughly mix before use.
2. Plate setup:
◦ Refer to the kit insert for the specific setup and sequence of
adding calibrators, controls, and samples.
3. Addition of samples and reagents:
◦ Add the appropriate volume of calibrators, controls, and
serum samples to the designated wells.
◦ Add enzyme conjugate to each well as instructed.
◦ Incubate the plate at 37°C for the specified time.
4. Washing:
◦ Carefully wash the wells several times with wash buffer.
Ensure complete removal of excess liquid at each step.
5. Substrate Reaction:
◦ Add the substrate solution to each well.
◦ Incubate at room temperature in the dark for the instructed
time.
6. Stopping the reaction:
◦ Add stop solution to each well in the same order as the
substrate solution.
7. Reading the plate:
◦ Measure the absorbance at 450 nm with a reference filter of
620–650 nm.
7.3. Data Analysis
• Construct a standard curve using the absorbance values of the
calibrators.
• Determine the concentration of Botrytis Cinerea IgE in the serum
samples from the standard curve.
• Verify that the control samples fall within the acceptable range
before validating the patient results.
1. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
• Results are reported in kU/L.
• The reference range and clinical decision points should be as
stated in the manufacturer's instructions and clinical guidelines.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• All results should be reviewed and verified by a qualified
laboratory technologist.
• Any unexpected high or low results should be repeated for
confirmation.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, icteric, or microbially contaminated samples
may affect results.
• Refer to the assay kit insert for additional method-specific
limitations.
1. SAFETY
• Follow all laboratory safety protocols including the use of personal
protective equipment (PPE).
• Handle all biohazardous materials with appropriate precautions.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's instructions for the specific ELISA Kit used.
• Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) guidelines.
• Standard practice references as applicable.
End of SOP
Always refer to the most current guidelines and regulations as
provided by the manufacturers and relevant regulatory bodies.
