Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) and IgE in
Serum
1. Purpose:
This protocol outlines the steps necessary for the quantitative
determination of Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) and Immunoglobulin E
(IgE) in serum samples. It ensures consistent, accurate, and
reproducible results in a CLIA-certified laboratory setting.
2. Responsibility:
• Laboratory Technologists are responsible for performing the
assay.
• The Laboratory Supervisor is responsible for ensuring that
Technologists are trained and competent to perform the assay.
3. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies:
• Microplate reader with wavelength capacity of 450 nm (for IgE)
and 595 nm (for BSA).
• Microplate washer or manual washing equipment.
• Calibrated pipettes and tips.
• Microcentrifuge.
• Bovine Serum Albumin Standard (for BSA assay).
• IgE calibrators and controls.
• ELISA kits for BSA and IgE with all reagents (coated microplates,
wash buffers, substrates, stop solutions).
• Incubators set to 37°C.
• Deionized water.
• Serum sample collection equipment (serum separator tubes).
• Laboratory timer.
4. Specimen Requirements and Handling:
• Specimen Type: Serum.
• Collection: Serum separator tubes (SSTs). Allow specimens to
clot at room temperature for 30 minutes before centrifugation.
• Centrifugation: Centrifuge tubes at 1,500 x g for 10-15 minutes
at room temperature.
• Storage: Aliquot serum into appropriate microtubes and store at ≤
-20°C if not analyzed immediately. Avoid multiple freeze-thaw
cycles.
5. Procedure:
A. Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) Assay:
1. Preparation: a. Bring all reagents and samples to room
temperature before starting the assay. b. Prepare a standard
curve using the BSA Standard. Prepare dilutions according to
kit instructions.
2. Assay Setup: a. Add 100 µL of prepared standards, controls,
and serum samples in duplicate to the appropriate wells. b. Add
200 µL of Bradford reagent to each well.
3. Incubation: a. Incubate the plate at room temperature for at
least 5-10 minutes.
4. Measurement: a. Measure the absorbance at 595 nm using a
microplate reader.
5. Data Analysis: a. Plot the standard curve and calculate the
concentration of BSA in the samples using the linear regression
equation from the standard curve.
B. Immunoglobulin E (IgE) Assay:
1. Preparation: a. Bring all reagents and samples to room
temperature before the assay. b. Prepare a standard curve
using IgE calibrators. Prepare dilutions according to kit
instructions.
2. Assay Setup: a. Add 100 µL of calibrators, controls, and
samples to the appropriate wells. b. Add 100 µL of enzyme-
linked antibody to each well.
3. Incubation: a. Incubate the plate at 37°C for 30 minutes.
4. Washing: a. Wash the plate 5 times with the provided wash
buffer.
5. Substrate Addition: a. Add 100 µL of TMB substrate to each
well. Incubate at room temperature in the dark for 15 minutes.
6. Stopping Reaction: a. Add 100 µL of stop solution to each well
to stop the reaction.
7. Measurement: a. Measure the absorbance at 450 nm using a
microplate reader.
8. Data Analysis: a. Plot the standard curve and use it to
calculate the IgE concentration in the samples using the linear
regression equation.
6. Quality Control:
• Run the provided control samples with each batch of assays.
• Verify that control values fall within the acceptable range provided
by the manufacturer.
• If controls fall outside the acceptable range, troubleshoot and
repeat the assay. Notify the supervisor if persistent issues arise.
7. Reporting Results:
• Enter the results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Verify the results against control values and standard curves.
• Ensure all unusual results are reviewed and confirmed before
releasing them.
8. Method Limitations:
• Hemolysis, lipemia, or icterus in serum samples can affect the
accuracy of the results.
• Ensure proper handling and storage of reagents and samples to
prevent degradation.

ELISA kit.

kit.
This protocol ensures that Bovine Serum Albumin and IgE are
consistently and accurately measured in serum samples, maintaining
the reliability and integrity of laboratory results.
