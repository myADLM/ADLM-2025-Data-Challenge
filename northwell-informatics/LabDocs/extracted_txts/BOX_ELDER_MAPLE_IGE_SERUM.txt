Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for BOX ELDER/MAPLE, IGE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
This document outlines the procedures for analyzing BOX ELDER/
MAPLE, IgE levels in serum specimens received in the laboratory.
The purpose of this SOP is to ensure accurate, consistent, and
reproducible results while maintaining compliance with CLIA
regulations.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing the
analysis, reviewing and verifying results, and documenting all steps
according to this SOP.
1. DEFINITION
BOX ELDER/MAPLE, IgE assay: This test detects the presence and
quantifies the level of Immunoglobulin E (IgE) specific to BOX
ELDER/MAPLE allergens in serum specimens, aiding in the
diagnosis of allergic responses.
1. PROCEDURE
Specimen Requirements and Stability:
• Preferred specimen: 2 mL of serum collected in a red-top or
serum separator tube (SST).
• Specimen must be processed within 2 hours of collection
(centrifugation for serum separation).
• Serum specimens can be stored at 2-8°C for up to 48 hours or
frozen at -20°C or lower for longer storage.
Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies:
• ImmunoCAP Specific IgE Assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific or
equivalent)
• Refrigerated centrifuge
• Micropipettes and sterile tips
• Vortex mixer
• Incubator set at 37°C
• Calibration standards and controls for IgE
• Reagent-grade water
• Personal protective equipment (PPE): gloves, lab coat, safety
glasses
Procedure Steps:
1. Ensure all reagents and equipment are prepared and calibrated
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Allow serum specimens to reach room temperature if
refrigerated or frozen.
3. Label a sufficient number of microtiter wells corresponding to
the number of patient samples, standards, and controls.
4. Pipette 50 µL of each serum specimen, standard, and control
into the designated wells.
5. Add 50 µL of specific allergen reagent (BOX ELDER/MAPLE) to
each well.
6. Mix well using a vortex mixer for 10 seconds.
7. Incubate the wells at 37°C for 1 hour to allow antigen-antibody
binding.
8. Wash the wells 3-5 times with reagent-grade water to remove
unbound components.
9. Add 50 µL of enzyme-conjugated secondary antibody (anti-IgE)
to each well.
10. Incubate the wells at 37°C for 30 minutes.
11. Wash the wells as previously described.
12. Add 50 µL of substrate solution to each well and incubate at
room temperature for 15 minutes.
13. Measure the optical density (OD) of the wells using a
microplate reader at the recommended wavelength (450 nm).
14. Record the OD readings for each sample, standard, and
control.
Quantification and Reporting:
• Create a standard curve using the OD readings from the known
calibration standards for IgE.
• Calculate the concentration of BOX ELDER/MAPLE, IgE for each
patient sample using the standard curve.
• Ensure all quality control materials fall within acceptable ranges. If
QC results are outside acceptable limits, repeat the analysis after
troubleshooting.
Quality Control:
• Use two levels of control material for each run—low and high IgE
standards to ensure accuracy.
• Record all control results before releasing patient results.
• If controls fail, troubleshoot per guidelines and repeat the test
before reporting.
Reporting Results:
• Results should be reviewed by a trained technologist.
• Values within the reference range should be reported without any
action.
• Values outside the reference range should be flagged and
reviewed for accurate reporting.
Reference Intervals:
• Follow site-specific reference intervals for BOX ELDER/MAPLE,
IgE in serum.
Method Limitations:
Refer to the assay kit manufacturer’s protocol for limitations specific
to the ImmunoCAP assay used.
Documentation and Records:
• Maintain logs of all reagent lot numbers, expiration dates,
equipment calibration, and patient test results.
• Ensure all recorded data is complete, accurate, and legible.

The above SOP ensures standardized practice for BOX ELDER/
MAPLE, IgE serum testing and maintains compliance with all relevant
regulatory guidelines.
