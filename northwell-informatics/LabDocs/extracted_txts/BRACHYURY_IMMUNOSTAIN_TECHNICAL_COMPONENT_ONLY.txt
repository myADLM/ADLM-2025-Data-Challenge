Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for BRACHYURY
IMMUNOSTAIN, TECHNICAL COMPONENT ONLY
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to describe the procedure for the
immunohistochemical staining of tissue sections using the Brachyury
antibody to enable the specific localization of Brachyury protein within
a sample. This procedure covers the technical component only and
does not include the interpretation of results.
Responsibility:
The laboratory technologist is responsible for performing the
immunostaining procedure according to this SOP. It is the
responsibility of the supervisor to ensure that the procedure is
followed correctly and that any issues are addressed promptly.
1. DEFINITION
Immunohistochemistry (IHC) is a method used to detect specific
antigens in tissue sections by employing antibodies that bind to
specific proteins. The Brachyury antibody is used to identify the
expression of the Brachyury protein, which is critical in certain
pathological conditions.
1. PROCEDURE
a. Reagents and Supplies: - Brachyury primary antibody (validated
for use in immunohistochemistry) - Secondary antibody conjugated to
an enzyme (e.g., HRP) - Detection substrate (e.g., DAB or AEC) -
Blocking solution - Antigen retrieval solution - IHC-grade wash buffer
(e.g., PBS or TBS) - Mounting medium - Positive and negative control
slides - Microscope slides with formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded
tissue sections
b. Equipment: - Microtome - Incubator or oven - Humidified chamber
- Slide staining racks - Light microscope - Appropriate personal
protective equipment (PPE)
c. Specimen: - Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue sections
mounted on microscope slides.
d. Preparation: 1. Cut 4-5 µm sections from paraffin-embedded tissue
blocks using a microtome. 2. Mount sections onto positively charged
slides and dry overnight at 37°C or for 1-2 hours at approximately
60°C.
e. Deparaffinization and Rehydration: 1. Deparaffinize slides in
xylene or a suitable substitute for 2 x 5 minutes. 2. Rehydrate slides
through a graded series of ethanol solutions (100%, 95%, 70%) for 2
minutes each. 3. Rinse in distilled water.
f. Antigen Retrieval: 1. Immerse slides in an antigen retrieval solution
(e.g., citrate buffer, pH 6.0) and heat in a microwave oven, pressure
cooker, or water bath according to the manufacturer's instructions. 2.
Allow slides to cool to room temperature and rinse in wash buffer.
g. Blocking: 1. Apply blocking solution to cover the tissue section and
incubate for 10 minutes to block non-specific binding. 2. Drain excess
blocking solution without washing.
h. Primary Antibody Incubation: 1. Apply the Brachyury primary
antibody diluted according to the manufacturer's instructions to cover
the tissue section. 2. Incubate in a humidified chamber for 30-60
minutes or according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. 3.
Rinse slides in wash buffer with gentle agitation.
i. Secondary Antibody Incubation: 1. Apply the secondary antibody to
cover the tissue section and incubate as per manufacturer’s
instructions. 2. Rinse slides in wash buffer with gentle agitation.
j. Detection Visualization: 1. Apply the detection substrate (e.g., DAB
or AEC) and incubate for the prescribed time while monitoring the
development of the chromogen. 2. Rinse slides in running water to
stop the reaction.
k. Counterstaining: 1. Counterstain with hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes.
2. Rinse in running tap water. 3. Blue the sections in ammonia water
or a suitable bluing reagent. 4. Rinse in distilled water.
l. Dehydration and Mounting: 1. Dehydrate slides through a graded
series of ethanol solutions (70%, 95%, 100%) and clear in xylene. 2.
Mount coverslips using a permanent mounting medium.
m. Quality Control: 1. Include appropriate positive and negative
control slides with each run. 2. Ensure that the staining intensity and
localization are consistent with expected results for controls. 3.
Document any discrepancies and notify the supervisor for further
action. 4. Record batch numbers of antibodies and reagents used.
n. Reporting Results: 1. Provide the stained slides to the pathologist
for interpretation. 2. Document all procedures performed, including
any deviations from the SOP, in the laboratory information system.
