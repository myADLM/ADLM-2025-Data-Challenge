Standard Operating Procedure for BRAF and KIT Mutation
Analysis Using Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS), Tumor
1. PURPOSE: To provide a systematic and standardized method for
the detection of BRAF and KIT mutations in tumor samples using
next-generation sequencing (NGS).
Responsibility: It is the responsibility of designated laboratory
personnel to perform BRAF and KIT mutation analyses as outlined in
this procedure. The laboratory supervisor must ensure all staff are
trained and follow the SOP precisely. Laboratory personnel must
document all processes accurately and report any problems
encountered during the procedure to the supervisor.
2. DEFINITIONS:
• BRAF: Serine/threonine-protein kinase B-Raf, mutations in which
are often associated with various cancers.
• KIT: A receptor tyrosine kinase, mutations in which are related to
gastrointestinal stromal tumors, melanoma, and other
malignancies.
• NGS (Next-Generation Sequencing): A high-throughput method
to sequence DNA and RNA to detect genetic variants, including
mutations.
• Tumor Sample: A biopsy or surgical specimen from a tumor.
3. PROCEDURE:
A. Sample Preparation:
1. Specimen:
◦ Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue samples or
fresh frozen tumor tissue.
◦ Preferred tumor content should be greater than 50%.
2. DNA Extraction:
◦ Use a commercially available DNA extraction kit specifically
designed for FFPE or fresh frozen tissue.
◦ Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for DNA extraction.
◦ Quantify the extracted DNA using spectrophotometry or
fluorometry.
◦ Assess DNA quality using gel electrophoresis or a
bioanalyzer.
B. Library Preparation:
1. Target Enrichment:
◦ Use a commercially available target enrichment kit specific
for BRAF and KIT mutations.
◦ Follow the manufacturer's protocol for hybridization-based
capture of target regions.
2. Library Construction:
◦ Fragment the DNA to the desired size (typically 150-200
bp).
◦ End-repair and A-tail the fragmented DNA.
◦ Ligate adapters to the DNA fragments.
◦ Amplify the library using PCR and purify the amplified
library.
C. Sequencing:
1. Sequencing Platform:
◦ Load the prepared library onto an NGS platform (e.g.,
Illumina, Thermo Fisher).
◦ Use paired-end sequencing with a suitable read length (e.g.,
2x100 bp).
2. Run Setup:
◦ Follow the manufacturer's instructions to load the samples
and set up the sequencing run.
◦ Include appropriate positive and negative controls in the
sequencing run.
D. Data Analysis:
1. Quality Control:
◦ Use bioinformatics tools to assess the quality of sequencing
reads (e.g. FastQC).
◦ Perform trimming to remove low-quality bases and adapter
sequences.
2. Alignment and Variant Calling:
◦ Align the sequencing reads to the reference genome using a
suitable aligner (e.g., BWA, Bowtie2).
◦ Call variants using appropriate software (e.g., GATK,
FreeBayes).
◦ Filter variants based on quality metrics (e.g., read depth,
variant allele frequency).
3. Annotation and Interpretation:
◦ Annotate variants using a variant annotation tool (e.g.,
ANNOVAR, VEP).
◦ Interpret the clinical significance of detected mutations using
relevant databases (e.g., COSMIC, ClinVar).
E. Reporting Results:
1. Documentation:
◦ Prepare a report summarizing the results, including detected
mutations, their clinical significance, and any potential
implications for patient management.
◦ Include details on the methodology, including DNA input
amount, library preparation, sequencing platform, and
bioinformatics pipeline used.
2. Review and Verification:
◦ Have the report reviewed and verified by a second qualified
individual.
◦ Ensure that any discrepancies are reconciled and noted in
the final report.
3. Communication:
◦ Provide the final report to the requesting clinician or
healthcare provider.
◦ Ensure any critical findings are communicated promptly.
F. Quality Control and Validation:
1. Controls:
◦ Routinely run positive and negative controls with each batch
of samples.
◦ Perform competency testing of laboratory personnel
annually.
2. Proficiency Testing:
◦ Participate in external proficiency testing programs to
ensure the accuracy and reliability of test results.

Conclusion: This SOP ensures the accurate, reliable, and
standardized detection of BRAF and KIT mutations in tumor samples
using next-generation sequencing. Adherence to the SOP is essential
for maintaining high-quality laboratory results and supporting clinical
decision-making.
