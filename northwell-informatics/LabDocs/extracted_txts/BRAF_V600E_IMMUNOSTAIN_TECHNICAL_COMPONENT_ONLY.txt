Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for BRAF V600E
Immunostain, Technical Component Only
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for the technical component of the BRAF
V600E immunostain test, which involves the preparation, staining,
and microscopic evaluation of tissue specimens for the presence of
the BRAF V600E mutation, applicable for research and diagnostic
purposes. This SOP ensures consistent, reliable, and accurate
results.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of all laboratory staff involved in the BRAF
V600E testing to follow this SOP to ensure the integrity and accuracy
of the test results.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Acceptable Specimens:
◦ Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks.
◦ Unstained slides prepared from FFPE tissue blocks, 4-5
microns thick.
• Unacceptable Specimens:
◦ Fresh or frozen tissues.
◦ Specimens fixed in non-formalin fixatives.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• BRAF V600E-specific primary antibody.
• Bond-Max AutoStainer (or equivalent automated immunostaining
platform).
• Detection system (e.g., Bond Polymer Refine Detection).
• DAB (3,3'-diaminobenzidine) chromogen.
• Hematoxylin counterstain.
• Xylene, ethanol, and appropriate mounting media.
• Water bath.
• Block paraffin-embedding station.
• Microtome.
• Positive control tissue with known BRAF V600E mutation.
• Slides and coverslips.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Slide Preparation and Deparaffinization:
1. Section FFPE tissue blocks at 4-5 microns and mount sections
on positively charged slides.
2. Bake slides in a 60°C oven for 1 hour.
3. Deparaffinize slides in three changes of xylene, 5 minutes each.
4. Rehydrate through a series of graded ethanol solutions (100%,
95%, 80%), 2 minutes each, then rinse in distilled water.
B. Antigen Retrieval:
1. Place slides in a preheated retrieval buffer (e.g., EDTA buffer,
pH 8.0) and incubate in a water bath at 97°C for 20-30 minutes.
2. Cool slides for 20 minutes at room temperature.
3. Wash slides thoroughly in running distilled water.
C. Immunostaining:
1. Load slides onto the Bond-Max AutoStainer.
2. Select the appropriate protocol for BRAF V600E
immunostaining.
3. The Bond-Max AutoStainer will apply the following steps
automatically:
◦ Application of the BRAF V600E-specific primary antibody,
incubation for 30 minutes.
◦ Rinse slides with wash buffer.
◦ Application of secondary antibody/Polymer detection
system, incubation for 10 minutes.
◦ Rinse slides with wash buffer.
◦ Application of DAB chromogen, incubation for 5 minutes.
◦ Rinse slides with wash buffer.
◦ Counterstain with hematoxylin, incubation for 5 minutes.
◦ Rinse slides with distilled water.
◦ Dehydrate through graded alcohols to xylene.
4. Manually cover slip the stained slides using appropriate
mounting media.
D. Quality Control:
1. Include a positive control slide with known BRAF V600E
mutation for each batch of staining.
2. Review the positive control:
◦ Ensure the control shows adequate staining.
◦ Document if the control fails, and repeat the batch if
necessary.
E. Interpretation:
1. Microscopically evaluate the stained slides.
2. Look for brown cytoplasmic staining indicative of BRAF V600E
mutation.
3. Record observations and ensure they are provided to the
pathologist for analysis.
4. REPORTING RESULTS
Technical results (slide preparation and staining quality) are reviewed
and documented. Pathologists will provide their final diagnostic report
after interpreting the stained slides.
