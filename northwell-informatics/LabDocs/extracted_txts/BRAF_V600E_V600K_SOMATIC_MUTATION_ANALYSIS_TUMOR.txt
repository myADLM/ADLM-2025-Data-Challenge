Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
BRAF V600E/V600K Somatic Mutation Analysis, Tumor
1. PURPOSE
This protocol outlines the procedures for the detection of BRAF
V600E/V600K mutations in tumor tissue. This analysis is used to
identify specific somatic mutations in the BRAF gene, which may
have diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic implications for cancer
patients.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel trained in molecular
diagnostic techniques and working within the molecular pathology
department.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Molecular Pathologists: Perform data analysis and interpretation
of results.
• Technicians/Technologists: Conduct the molecular tests as per the
SOP, document the results, and ensure quality control.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
• Specimen Type: Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue
or fresh/frozen tumor tissue.
• Minimum Amount: At least 5-10 unstained slides (5-micron thick)
or one tissue block.
• Storage: FFPE blocks and unstained slides can be stored at
room temperature. Fresh/frozen tissue should be stored at -80°C.
5. REAGENTS AND EQUIPMENT
• Reagents:
◦ DNA extraction kit (e.g., Qiagen QIAamp DNA FFPE Tissue
Kit)
◦ PCR assay mixture, primers, and probes specific for BRAF
V600E and V600K mutations.
◦ Master mix for real-time PCR (e.g., TaqMan Genotyping
Master Mix)
◦ Nuclease-free water
◦ Positive and negative controls for BRAF V600E and V600K
mutations
• Equipment:
◦ Microcentrifuge
◦ PCR thermocycler
◦ Real-time PCR machine
◦ Vortex mixer
◦ Pipettes and filtered pipette tips
◦ DNA quantification instruments (e.g., NanoDrop or Qubit
fluorometer)
6. PROCEDURE
A. DNA Extraction
1. FFPE Tissue:
◦ Deparaffinize a minimum of 5-10 unstained sections (5-
micron thick) using xylene and ethanol washes.
◦ Perform DNA extraction according to the manufacturer's
instructions for the chosen DNA extraction kit.
2. Fresh/Frozen Tissue:
◦ Homogenize tissue samples using appropriate methods.
◦ Extract DNA as per manufacturer’s guidelines.
B. Quantification of DNA
1. Measure DNA concentration using a NanoDrop
spectrophotometer or a Qubit fluorometer.
2. Ensure the DNA purity with 260/280 and 260/230 ratios (1.8-2.0
is acceptable).
C. PCR Amplification
1. Prepare the PCR master mix:
◦ Mix specific primers and probes for BRAF V600E and
V600K mutations.
◦ Add the real-time PCR master mix.
◦ Include DNA templates, positive control, and negative
control.
2. Distribute the master mix into PCR tubes or plates.
3. Load DNA samples, positive, and negative controls into the
appropriate wells.
4. Set up the real-time PCR thermocycler with the following
conditions:
◦ Initial denaturation at 95°C for 10 minutes.
◦ 40 cycles of 95°C for 15 seconds and 60°C for 1 minute.
D. Analysis and Interpretation
1. Analyze the amplification plots for the presence of BRAF
V600E and V600K mutations.
2. Compare the sample curve with those of positive and negative
controls.
3. Confirm mutation status if the sample shows exponential
amplification matching the positive control curve.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform all extractions and PCR reactions with positive and
negative controls to ensure assay integrity.
• Document the lot numbers of all reagents and their expiry dates.
• Review and document the adherence to the protocol for each
batch of tests performed.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Review the amplification data and control results.
• Prepare the report including the presence or absence of BRAF
V600E/V600K mutations.
• Pathologists review and sign off on the final report.
• Enter and verify the results in the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• DNA degradation in FFPE samples may affect the sensitivity of
the assay.
• Ensure the absence of PCR inhibitors in the extracted DNA to
avoid false negatives.
• Cross-contamination of DNA samples can lead to inaccurate
results.
10. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions for the DNA extraction kit and real-
time PCR reagents.

11. REVISION HISTORY
• Document all updates and changes to the SOP with dates and
designee signatures.
This SOP ensures a standardized approach to the detection of BRAF
V600E and V600K mutations, ensuring consistency, reliability, and
accuracy in molecular diagnostics.
