1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to outline the steps required for the
accurate analysis of branched-chain amino acids in self-collected
blood spot specimens. This protocol ensures reliable and
reproducible results that meet clinical needs.
Responsibility: Laboratory staff are responsible for performing the
analysis according to the following procedure. Supervisors are
responsible for monitoring the process and ensuring adherence to
the protocol.
1. DEFINITION
Branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) are essential amino acids,
including leucine, isoleucine, and valine, that are critical for muscle
function and metabolic processes. Blood spot specimens are
samples collected by patients at home using a lancet to deposit blood
onto a special filter paper.
1. PROCEDURE
Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies:
• Blood spot filter paper collection kits
• High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system or
tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS)
• BCAA standards (leucine, isoleucine, valine)
• Internal control standards
• Extraction and derivatization reagents
• Data analysis software
• Gloves and lab coats
• Pipettes
• Centrifuge
• Solvent (e.g., methanol, water, or acetonitrile)
Specimen Requirements:
• Self-collected blood spot samples must arrive in the laboratory
within 7 days of collection.
• Samples should be stored at room temperature until analysis.
• Specimens without proper labeling, visible contamination, or
insufficient quantity of blood will be rejected.
Procedure: A) Sample Preparation
• Verify the integrity and proper labeling of the blood spot samples.
• Cut out the blood spot area from the filter paper (approximately 6
mm in diameter).
• Place the blood spot in a microcentrifuge tube.
• Add 500 μL of solvent/extraction buffer (e.g., methanol-water
mixture) to the tube.
• Vortex the mixture for 1 minute.
• Allow the sample to incubate at room temperature for 30 minutes.
• Centrifuge the tube at 10,000 rpm for 10 minutes.
• Transfer the supernatant to a clean microcentrifuge tube.
B) Derivatization (if required)
• Add the necessary volume of derivatization reagent according to
the specific protocol for the HPLC/MS/MS system.
• Incubate the mixture at room temperature for the specified time
(usually 30-60 minutes).
C) HPLC/MS/MS Analysis
• Calibrate the HPLC/MS/MS instrument using BCAA standards
and internal controls.
• Load the prepared sample into the HPLC/MS/MS system.
• Run the sample according to the established method for BCAAs.
• Review the run and ensure the system is functioning without
errors.
D) Data Analysis
• Analyze the chromatogram/mass spectra using data analysis
software.
• Compare the sample results against BCAA standards and internal
controls.
• Ensure peaks are accurately identified and quantified.
• Perform quality control checks according to lab protocols.
Quality Control:
• Internal control samples should be run alongside patient samples.
• BCAA standards should be used for calibration and verification of
the HPLC/MS/MS system.
• Regular review of instrument performance and maintenance logs.
• Record all results and observations meticulously.
Reporting Results:
• Review the results and verify accuracy.
• Document any issues or deviations from protocol.
• Report results according to site-specific reporting guidelines.
• Provide interpretive comments if necessary.
Reference Intervals:
• Leucine: 101-198 μmol/L
• Isoleucine: 32-112 μmol/L
• Valine: 66-190 μmol/L
Method Limitations:
• Ensure no contamination of blood spot specimens during
collection and transport.
• Variations in blood spot size or blood volume may affect results.
• Consider possible interference from medications or other
metabolites.

• HPLC/MS/MS product inserts and method-specific literature.
• Clinical guidelines for BCAA measurement.
