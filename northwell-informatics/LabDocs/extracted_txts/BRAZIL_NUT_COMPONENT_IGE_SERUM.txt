Protocol for the Analytical Phase of Generating Results for
Brazil Nut Component, IgE, Serum
1. PURPOSE
To provide clear, step-by-step instructions to ensure the accurate
analysis and result generation of Brazil Nut Component, IgE, Serum
test in the laboratory.
Responsibility:
• All designated staff performing the Brazil Nut Component, IgE,
Serum test are responsible for following this protocol.
• Supervisors are responsible for overseeing the process, ensuring
adherence to the protocol, and addressing any issues that arise
during testing.
1. DEFINITION
The Brazil Nut Component, IgE, Serum test measures the specific
IgE antibodies to the Brazil nut in the patient’s serum. Elevated levels
of these antibodies may indicate an allergy to Brazil nuts.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Automated immunoassay analyzer (e.g., ImmunoCAP system, or
another designated analyzer for specific IgE measurements)
• Serum separator tubes (SST) for sample collection
• Brazil Nut Component, IgE, Serum reagent kit
• Calibrators and controls specific for IgE testing
• Pipettes and tips
• Personal protective equipment (PPE) including lab coat, gloves,
and safety goggles
• Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) compliant
tubes and reagents
1. PROCEDURE
Preparation and Calibration:
• Ensure the immunoassay analyzer is turned on and has
completed its initial warm-up and self-check procedures.
• Verify that all required reagents, calibrators, and controls are
available and within their expiration dates.
• Run calibration standards according to the manufacturer's
instructions to ensure the analyzer is properly calibrated for IgE
detection.
• Document the calibration process, including the lot numbers and
expiration dates of all calibrators and controls used.
Sample Handling:
• Ensure that the serum sample is properly collected, labeled, and
handled according to standard laboratory procedures.
• Centrifuge the SST tube containing the patient’s blood sample at
1500-2000 g for 10 minutes to separate the serum.
• Carefully pipette the serum into a CLSI compliant tube without
disturbing the cellular components or fibrin clot.
• Store the serum at 2-8°C if analysis is to be performed within 72
hours. For longer storage, freeze at -20°C or lower.
Assay Procedure:
• Load the patient serum sample, along with calibrators and
controls, into the designated positions on the immunoassay
analyzer.
• Select the appropriate test protocol for Brazil Nut Component,
IgE, Serum on the analyzer software.
• Initiate the assay run as per the analyzer’s operation guide.
• Monitor the assay process to ensure that no error messages or
alerts are generated. Address any issues as directed by the
analyzer’s operational manual.
Calculating and Verifying Results:
• Upon completion of the assay, review the raw data and ensure
that the quality control results fall within the acceptable range as
defined by the quality control protocol.
• Validate the test results by checking for consistency and
accordance with the calibration curve.
• If the control results are outside acceptable limits, do not report
patient results. Investigate and resolve the issue, repeating the
assay if necessary.
Documentation and Reporting:
• Document all steps of the analysis, including any deviations or
issues encountered, in the laboratory information system (LIS).
• Report the results in the LIS, and cross-verifying with patient
identifiers to ensure accurate reporting.
• Ensure that reports contain the following information: test name
(Brazil Nut Component, IgE, Serum), result, reference range,
interpretation if applicable, and remarks concerning any
deviations from the standard process.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
The reference intervals for IgE antibodies can vary but often require a
medical review to classify as negative, equivocal, or positive. Refer to
the specific manufacturer's suggested reference ranges or internal
lab-verified ranges.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform routine quality control according to the manufacturer’s
specifications to ensure the accuracy and precision of results.
• Document all quality control results, and address any out-of-
control results immediately with appropriate remedial actions.
• Participate in proficiency testing and internal audits for continual
quality assurance.
1. LIMITATIONS
• Incorrect sample handling and processing can lead to inaccurate
results. Ensure strict adherence to the sample handling protocol.
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or contaminated samples may affect the
accuracy of the assay.
• This assay only detects IgE antibodies specific to Brazil Nut
Component and should be interpreted in conjunction with other
clinical findings.

End of Protocol
Note: This protocol is to be reviewed and approved by the lab director
before implementation. Regular updates should be conducted to
incorporate any changes in testing procedures or equipment.
