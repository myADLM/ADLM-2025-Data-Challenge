SOP: Generating Results for Brazil Nut Component RBER E 1
1. PURPOSE
To describe the procedures for the analytical phase of generating
results for the Brazil Nut Component RBER E 1. This SOP provides
detailed instructions to ensure the accuracy, precision, and reliability
of test results.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
Qualified laboratory personnel are responsible for performing and
documenting the following procedures in compliance with established
laboratory standards. Supervisors and managers are responsible for
reviewing and ensuring adherence to this SOP.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type:
• Serum collected in a red or gold-top tube or plasma collected in
an EDTA or lithium heparin tube.
Specimen Stability:
• Serum or plasma should be tested as soon as possible after
collection. If storage is necessary, the specimen may be
refrigerated at 2-8°C for up to 48 hours or frozen at -20°C for
longer periods.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
• Specimens collected in sodium citrate or sodium fluoride tubes.
• Samples not properly labeled with collection date/time.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Immunoassay Analyzer (e.g., Phadia 250)
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes and tips
Reagents:
• BRAZIL NUT COMPONENT RBER E 1 ImmunoCAP reagent kit
• Quality control materials (positive and negative controls)
• Calibrators
Supplies:
• Test tubes
• Sample cups
• Calibration and QC log sheets
1. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Preparation:
1. Centrifuge whole blood specimens at 3,000 rpm for 10 minutes
to separate serum or plasma.
2. Transfer the serum or plasma to a clean labeled sample cup.
B. Equipment Setup:
1. Turn on the Immunoassay Analyzer.
2. Load the appropriate ImmunoCAP reagent cartridge into the
analyzer ensuring correct placement and identification.
C. Calibration:
1. Perform calibration using the provided calibrators as per the
manufacturer's instructions.
2. Document calibration data in the Calibration Logbook.
D. Quality Control:
1. Run quality control samples (positive and negative) at the
beginning of each testing batch.
2. Verify that QC results are within the acceptable range before
proceeding with sample analysis.
3. Document QC results in the Quality Control Logbook.
E. Sample Analysis:
1. Load prepared serum or plasma samples onto the analyzer.
2. Program the analyzer to perform the assay using the Brazil Nut
Component RBER E 1 ImmunoCAP reagent.
3. Start the run and monitor the analyzer for any alerts or errors
during the testing process.
F. Result Calculation and Interpretation:
1. Upon completion of the assay, review the results displayed by
the analyzer.
2. Ensure that the results for quality control samples are within the
acceptable range; otherwise, investigate and repeat the assay if
necessary.
3. Interpret results based on the reference ranges provided by the
reagent manufacturer and clinical guidelines.
1. RESULT REPORTING
2. Document the results in the Laboratory Information System
(LIS) to ensure accurate and timely reporting.
3. If critical values are identified, notify the responsible healthcare
provider immediately, and document the communication.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Reference intervals for Brazil Nut Component RBER E 1 should
be obtained from the specific reagent insert or provided by the
reagent manufacturer and should be included in the reporting
guidelines.
1. QUALITY ASSURANCE
2. Participate in proficiency testing and external quality
assessment (EQA) programs to ensure the accuracy and
reliability of test results.
3. Regularly review and update this SOP to reflect changes in
technology, reagents, and laboratory best practices.
