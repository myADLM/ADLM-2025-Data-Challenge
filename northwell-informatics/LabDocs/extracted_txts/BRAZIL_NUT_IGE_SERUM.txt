Protocol for the Analytical Phase of Generating Results for
BRAZIL NUT, IGE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this protocol is to outline the procedures for the
analytical phase of generating results for Brazil Nut, IgE, Serum in a
clinical laboratory setting. This ensures accurate and reproducible
results that comply with the Clinical Laboratory Improvement
Amendments (CLIA) standards.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
Laboratory technologists are responsible for carrying out this
protocol. It is the responsibility of laboratory supervisors to ensure
that technologists are trained and competent in this protocol. All
laboratory staff must ensure results are reported accurately and
timely.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Type: Serum
• Volume: Minimum 0.5 mL
• Collection Tube: Serum separator tube (SST)
• Stability: Specimen should be processed and stored at 2-8°C if
not immediately analyzed. For long-term storage, freeze at -20°C
or lower.
• Handling: Ensure specimen is free from hemolysis, lipemia, and
icterus.
4. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Automated Immunoassay Analyzer or ELISA Reader
• Brazil Nut, IgE-specific test kits (approved and validated for use)
• Calibrators and controls (low, medium, and high)
• Micropipettes and tips
• Centrifuge
• SST tubes and plain collection tubes
• Refrigerator 2-8°C and Freezer -20°C
• Incubator (if using ELISA-based methods)
5. PRE-ANALYSIS
• Verify the specimen (patient identification, type, volume, and
condition) against the laboratory requisition form.
• Centrifuge blood samples at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes to separate
serum from cells.
• Aliquot serum into appropriately labeled secondary tubes for
analysis.
6. ANALYTICAL PROCEDURE
A. Using an Automated Immunoassay Analyzer:
1. Calibration and Quality Control:
◦ Refer to the device-specific instruction manual and prepare
calibrators and controls as per manufacturer’s guidelines.
◦ Perform calibration of the analyzer prior to testing patient
samples.
◦ Run quality controls (QC) at low, medium, and high levels.
Ensure QC results fall within the acceptable range before
proceeding.
2. Sample Loading:
◦ Load patient serum samples into the sample rack of the
analyzer.
◦ Enter sample identification and required test parameters into
the system.
3. Assay Procedure:
◦ Select the Brazil Nut, IgE assay from the analyzer’s test
menu.
◦ Start the assay run following the manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Allow the analyzer to process samples, perform the
reaction, wash steps, and signal detection.
4. Result Analysis and Verification:
◦ Review the results generated by the analyzer.
◦ Verify that all QC results are within acceptable limits.
◦ Ensure results are free of technical errors (e.g., flags or
error codes).
B. Using ELISA-based Method:
1. Reagent Preparation:
◦ Prepare reagents and wash solutions as per manufacturer’s
instructions.
◦ Pre-warm reagents to room temperature if required.
2. Assay Procedure:
◦ Add calibrators, controls, and patient serum samples into
the respective wells of the ELISA plate.
◦ Add enzyme-labeled antibodies and incubate at room
temperature or specified temperature for the recommended
duration.
◦ Wash plates as recommended between steps to avoid
cross-contamination.
◦ Add substrate and incubate for specified time.
◦ Add stop solution and read optical density (OD) at the
recommended wavelength using the ELISA reader.
3. Result Calculation:
◦ Generate and review the standard curve from calibrators.
◦ Calculate IgE concentration for the patient samples using
the standard curve.
4. Result Analysis and Verification:
◦ Review the OD readings and ensure proper quality control.
◦ Verify that all QC results fall within acceptable limits.
◦ Ensure result consistency and troubleshoot any outliers or
anomalies.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
• Enter verified results into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
• Ensure that results include reference ranges for the specific assay
used.
• Flag any results that fall outside the reference ranges as "high" or
"low" as needed.
• Ensure timely reporting to the requesting clinician.
8. QUALITY CONTROL AND PERFORMANCE
• Perform QC checks at the beginning of each shift and when
opening a new test kit.
• Document all QC results and any corrective actions taken if QC
falls outside the acceptable range.
• Perform regular maintenance and calibration of equipment as per
manufacturer guidelines.
9. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions for the Immunoassay Analyzer or
ELISA Kit.
• Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines.
• Laboratory’s internal quality procedures and documentation.
10. RECORDING AND DOCUMENTATION
• Maintain documentation for specimen handling, test performance,
QC, and calibration.
• Record results and any issues encountered during the analytical
phase in the laboratory’s record-keeping system.
