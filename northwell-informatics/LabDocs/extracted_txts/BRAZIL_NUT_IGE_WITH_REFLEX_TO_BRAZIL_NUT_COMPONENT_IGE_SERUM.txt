Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase Procedures for BRAZIL NUT, IGE WITH
REFLEX TO BRAZIL NUT COMPONENT, IGE, SERUM Testing
Document Number: LAB-SOP-XX
Revision Date: October 2023
Approved by: [Lab Director Name]
1. PURPOSE
To outline the analytical phase procedures for generating
results for BRAZIL NUT, IGE WITH REFLEX TO BRAZIL NUT
COMPONENT, IGE, SERUM testing. This procedure ensures
consistent, accurate, and timely processing and reporting of
test results in compliance with CLIA standards.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
All trained laboratory personnel are responsible for carrying out
this procedure as outlined. The Laboratory Supervisor is
accountable for overseeing the procedure and ensuring
compliance.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type: Serum
Collection Container: Red-top or gold-top serum separator tube
(SST).
Specimen Volume: Minimum of 2 mL.
Acceptance Criteria:
- Specimens must be clearly labeled with patient information. -
Specimen must be free of hemolysis, lipemia, and clots. -
Specimen must be stored at 2-8°C if not immediately
processed; stability is up to 72 hours refrigerated.
4. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation and Initial Testing
5. Equilibrate the specimen to room temperature (~20-26°C).
6. Collect required reagents and prepare the analyzer for IgE
testing.
7. Perform an auto-calibration of the analyzer according to
manufacturer’s instructions before starting the test.
8. Using automated or manual methods, perform an IgE test for
Brazil nut allergen: a. Pipette appropriate volume (as specified
by the analyzer protocol) of serum into the test reagent well.
b. Follow the analyzer’s instructions for the IgE test, ensuring
proper setup and reagent placement.
9. Document the initial Brazil nut IgE test results in the LIS.
B) Reflex Testing to Brazil Nut Components
1. If the initial Brazil nut IgE result is positive or exceeds the
predefined threshold, initiate testing for Brazil nut components:
a. Obtain the reflex testing reagents for specific Brazil nut
components (e.g., Ber e 1, Ber e 2). b. Pipette appropriate
volumes of serum into the designated wells for each component
test. c. Perform the tests as per manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Compile and document component IgE results in the LIS.
C) Quality Control
1. Execute routine quality control (QC) with manufacturer-provided
control sera: a. Run three levels of QC material (low, medium,
high) daily, and after system maintenance. b. Record QC
results and verify within established acceptable ranges.
2. If QC results fall outside acceptable limits: a. Stop testing and
perform recalibration or troubleshooting. b. Repeat QC runs to
ensure analyzer stability.
3. Document QC validation in the QC logbook.
D) Result Verification and Reporting
1. Review generated patient results on the analyzer.
2. Confirm the absence of analytical errors, system messages, or
flags.
3. Verify results of both initial IgE and reflex component testing: a.
Ensure consistency with QC data. b. Confirm proper integration
in LIS.
4. Report verified results to the clinician through LIS:
◦ Results should include initial IgE and reflex component
values, and associated reference ranges.
◦ Any reflex results should contain a comment indicating
further component testing was performed.
5. STORAGE AND MAINTENANCE
6. Store reagents at conditions as specified by the manufacturer.
7. Ensure the analyzer is clean and maintained regularly
according to manufacturer guidelines.
8. Keep records of maintenance activities, calibrations, and
troubleshooting.
9. REFERENCES

10. RECORDS
All logs, QC records, maintenance records, and patient test
results must be retained as per the laboratory's standard
record-keeping protocol and regulatory requirements.
