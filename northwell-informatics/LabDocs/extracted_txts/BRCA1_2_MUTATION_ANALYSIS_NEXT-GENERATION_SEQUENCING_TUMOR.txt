BRCA1/2 Mutation Analysis Protocol Next-Generation Sequencing
(NGS) - Tumor
1. PURPOSE
To provide standardized procedures for the analytical phase of
generating results for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation analysis using
next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology from tumor samples.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
Qualified laboratory personnel trained in next-generation sequencing
and related procedures are responsible for performing the analysis
and ensuring the accuracy of results. It is the responsibility of
laboratory supervisors to review and validate the results according to
established quality control (QC) guidelines.
1. DEFINITIONS
BRCA1/2: Genes associated with a higher risk of breast and ovarian
cancer when mutated. Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS): High-
throughput sequencing technology used to determine the sequence
of nucleotides in DNA. Tumor Sample: Biopsy or surgical specimen
containing malignant cells for genetic analysis.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/acceptable:
• Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue block or
unstained slides (at least 10 sections of 5-10 microns each).
• Fresh or frozen tumor tissue. • DNA yield of at least 100 ng with a
concentration ≥ 20 ng/μL. • Tissue samples should be reviewed
by a pathologist to ensure at least 20% tumor content.
Unacceptable:
• Insufficient tumor content (less than 20%).
• Degraded DNA samples.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• DNA extraction kits (e.g., QIAGEN QIAamp DNA Mini Kit)
• NGS library preparation kits (e.g., Illumina TruSeq DNA PCR-
Free)
• NGS sequencing platform (e.g., Illumina MiSeq, Illumina
NextSeq)
• Pipettes and consumables (tips, tubes, etc.)
• Thermocycler
• Refrigerators and freezers for reagent and sample storage
• Bioanalyzer or equivalent device for DNA quality assessment
• Computational resources for data analysis
1. PROCEDURE
6.1. DNA Extraction
• Deparaffinize FFPE tissue sections if applicable.
• Extract DNA using the appropriate DNA extraction kit following the
manufacturer's instructions.
• Assess DNA concentration and purity using a spectrophotometer
(e.g., NanoDrop) and quality using a bioanalyzer.
• Document DNA yield and quality metrics.
6.2. Library Preparation
• Follow the manufacturer's protocol for the NGS library preparation
kit.
• Fragment the DNA if necessary.
• End-repair, A-tailing, and adapter ligation.
• Purify and size select the libraries using magnetic beads.
• Perform PCR amplification if required.
• Quantify and assess quality of libraries using a bioanalyzer.
6.3. Sequencing
• Load the libraries onto the NGS platform according to
manufacturer’s guidelines.
• Set up the sequencing run parameters.
• Monitor sequencing quality metrics throughout the run.
6.4. Data Analysis
• Use appropriate bioinformatics pipeline for sequence alignment,
variant calling, and annotation.
• Ensure proper data quality control by checking coverage, depth,
and other relevant metrics.
• Identify BRCA1 and BRCA2 variants and classify them according
to established guidelines (e.g., ACMG).
1. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Include positive and negative control DNA samples in each
batch of extracted DNA and library preparation.
◦ Utilize internal quality control checks to validate sequencing
runs (e.g., spike-in controls, sequencing depth checks).
◦ Perform inter-run and intra-run comparisons to ensure
consistency.
◦ Review and document all QC parameters and results.
2. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ Compile a detailed report including detected variants, their
classification, and interpretation.
◦ Include information on sequencing quality metrics and
coverage statistics.
◦ Submit the report for review and validation by a qualified
supervisor.
◦ Results should be documented and stored according to
laboratory information system (LIS) procedures.
3. METHOD LIMITATIONS
◦ Variants located in regions of low coverage or poor
sequencing quality may be missed.
◦ Interpretation of variants may be limited by current genetic
knowledge and databases.
4. SAFETY AND COMPLIANCE
• Adhere to all laboratory safety protocols, including the use of
personal protective equipment (PPE).
• Ensure compliance with CLIA, CAP, and applicable regulatory
guidelines.

• Manufacturer’s instructions for DNA extraction, library preparation
kit, and sequencing platform.
• ACMG guidelines for the interpretation of sequence variants.
• Relevant literature and updated guidelines on BRCA1/2 variant
classification.
1. RECORDS AND DOCUMENTATION
• Ensure all steps are documented in the laboratory workflow
system.
• Maintain detailed logs of specimens received, DNA extraction,
library preparation, sequencing runs, and data analysis results.
• Store and archive all quality control and validation records.
