STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE BRCA1/BRCA2 Genes,
Full Gene Analysis
1. PURPOSE
This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) outlines the steps and
procedures for the full gene analysis of BRCA1 and BRCA2 using
next-generation sequencing (NGS) and Sanger sequencing as
necessary for variant confirmation. The purpose is to provide a
comprehensive analysis of mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2
genes, which are important for assessing the risk of hereditary breast
and ovarian cancers.
1. SCOPE
This procedure is applicable to all laboratory personnel performing
the BRCA1/BRCA2 full gene analysis in our CLIA-certified laboratory.
It is designed to ensure accuracy, reliability, and reproducibility of test
results. All procedures described must be adhered to by all
designated laboratory staff.
1. RESPONSIBILITIES
• Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing
the BRCA1/BRCA2 gene analysis according to this SOP.
• Supervisors must ensure that all personnel performing this test
are adequately trained and competent.
• All staff must be vigilant about the quality of reagents, quality
control procedures, and maintain meticulous documentation
throughout the analytical process.
1. EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS
• DNA extraction kits
• NGS library preparation kits
• Thermal cycler for PCR
• NGS sequencer (e.g., Illumina platform)
• Sanger sequencing reagents and capillary electrophoresis
equipment
• BRCA1/BRCA2 gene-specific primers
• High-sensitivity DNA quantification tools (e.g., Qubit fluorometer)
• Positive and negative controls
• Bioinformatics software for sequence alignment and variant
calling
1. DEFINITIONS
• NGS: Next-Generation Sequencing, a method used to rapidly
sequence large amounts of DNA.
• Sanger Sequencing: A method for determining the nucleotide
sequence of DNA.
• BRCA1/BRCA2: Genes whose mutations are linked to an
increased risk of breast and ovarian cancers.
1. PROCEDURE
A. DNA Extraction
1. Retrieve the specimen and log the details on the Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
2. Extract genomic DNA from the provided samples using
validated DNA extraction kits.
3. Quantify DNA using a high-sensitivity assay. Ensure DNA
concentration and purity meet specified criteria before
proceeding.
4. Document the DNA concentration and purity in the appropriate
laboratory log.
B. Library Preparation for NGS
1. Prepare DNA libraries using a validated NGS library preparation
kit.
2. Ensure the quality and quantity of libraries are sufficient for
sequencing.
3. Prepare pooled libraries and load onto the NGS sequencer as
per manufacturer’s guidelines.
C. Sequencing
1. Generate sequence data for the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes
using the NGS sequencer.
2. Monitor the sequencing run to ensure optimal data generation.
3. Perform initial data processing on sequencer software and
transfer data to dedicated analysis workstation.
D. Data Analysis
1. Use bioinformatics software to align sequence reads to the
human reference genome (e.g., hg19).
2. Perform variant calling to identify mutations in BRCA1 and
BRCA2 genes.
3. Screen data for quality parameters: coverage depth, sequence
quality scores, and read distribution.
4. Review the variant list generated against established databases
to annotate and classify variants.
E. Confirmation of Variants (if necessary)
1. Select variants requiring confirmation through Sanger
sequencing based on preset criteria (e.g., novel or pathogenic
variants).
2. Design primers specific to regions of interest for PCR
amplification.
3. Perform PCR amplification and clean-up of the product.
4. Sequence the amplified product using Sanger sequencing
techniques.
5. Analyze Sanger sequencing data to confirm or refute the
presence of the selected variants.
F. Quality Control
1. Include a positive control (confirmed BRCA1/ BRCA2
mutations) and a negative control (wild-type sample) in each
batch analysis.
2. Review quality control data to ensure accuracy and consistency
of sequencing.
3. If control results deviate from expected, investigate and resolve
issues before proceeding with patient results.
4. Document all quality control results and actions taken in the
Quality Control Log.
G. Reporting
1. Document all findings in the LIS.
2. Draft a comprehensive report detailing identified variants, their
classifications (pathogenic, likely pathogenic, uncertain
significance, likely benign, benign), and any necessary
interpretations.
3. Include recommendations for genetic counseling based on the
identified variant classifications.
4. Ensure reports are reviewed and signed by certified personnel
before dissemination.

to ensure high-quality, consistent results in the BRCA1/BRCA2 full
gene analysis, effectively aiding in clinical diagnosis and risk
assessment for hereditary cancers.
