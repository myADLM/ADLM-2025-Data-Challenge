Standard Operating Procedure for the Analytical Phase of Generating
Results for BREAST CARCINOMA-ASSOCIATED ANTIGEN,
SERUM
1. PURPOSE
This procedure outlines the steps for the analysis of Breast
Carcinoma-Associated Antigen (BCA or CA 27.29), Serum. It ensures
the repeatability, reliability, and accuracy of test results for
appropriate clinical interpretation.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory technologists and supervisors
are responsible for performing, documenting, and verifying the
analysis of BCA in serum specimens as defined in this procedure,
ensuring compliance with CLIA regulations.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STORAGE
Specimens:
1. Preferred Specimen: Serum, collected in a red-top tube (no
additive) or SST (serum separator tube).
2. Volume: A minimum of 1 ml of serum is required.
Storage and Stability:
1. Refrigerate serum specimens at 2-8°C if the analysis will be
performed within 48 hours.
2. For longer storage, freeze the specimen at -20°C or lower.
Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
Unacceptable Specimens:
1. Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric specimens.
2. Specimens collected in anticoagulant tubes (e.g., EDTA,
heparin).
3. REAGENTS, INSTRUMENTS, AND MATERIALS
Reagents:
• Breast Carcinoma-Associated Antigen testing kit (specific to the
assay method).
• Manufacturer's reagents for calibration and quality control (QC).
Instruments:
• Automated immunoassay analyzer compatible with the BCA
assay kit.
• Refer to the manufacturer’s manual for operation and
maintenance details.
Materials:
• Micropipettes and tips
• Centrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Refrigerated storage
1. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Allow reagents and calibration materials to reach room
temperature before use.
2. Review calibration, control, and patient sample data from the
analyzer.
Calibration:
1. Perform calibration according to the manufacturer's instructions
before running patient samples.
2. Record calibration data and verify that all calibration
parameters meet the predetermined specifications.
Quality Control:
1. Analyze two levels of quality control (low and high) at the
beginning of each run.
2. Document QC results and ensure they fall within the defined
acceptable range.
3. If QC results are out of range, troubleshoot according to the
analyzer's manual and repeat QC.
Sample Analysis:
1. Ensure all serum specimens have been brought to room
temperature, thoroughly mixed, and centrifuged if visibly
particulate.
2. Load the patient samples, calibrators, and controls onto the
analyzer as per the manufacturer’s instructions.
3. Input the necessary patient information into the analyzer.
4. Start the analytical run, ensuring the analyzer conditions match
the assay kit requirements.
Result Verification and Reporting:
1. Review all generated data for each patient sample. Check for
errors and message codes.
2. Verify and document the results from the analyzer.
3. Report critical values immediately to a clinical supervisor or
attending physician.
4. Results with flags or potential interference should be reviewed,
and repeat testing performed if necessary.
5. REFERENCE RANGES
The reference ranges for the Breast Carcinoma-Associated Antigen
will be provided by the manufacturer of the assay kit. The laboratory
should verify these ranges based on their patient population if
necessary.
1. QUALITY ASSURANCE
2. Adhere to laboratory’s overall quality management and
continuous improvement programs.
3. Participate in proficiency testing and external QC programs as
available.
4. Review and audit the analytical process periodically to ensure
compliance with regulatory and accreditation requirements.
5. LIMITATIONS
6. Refer to manufacturer’s product insert for limitations regarding
assay performance.
7. High dose hook effect may occur at very high antigen levels.
Follow manufacturer protocols to address potential interference.
8. Results should be interpreted alongside clinical findings and
other diagnostic tests for a comprehensive assessment.
