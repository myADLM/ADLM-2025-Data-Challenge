BRG1 (SMARCA4) Immunostain Protocol – Technical
Component Only
1. Purpose This protocol outlines the procedure for performing
the technical component of the BRG1 (SMARCA4)
immunostain in the laboratory to ensure the consistent and
accurate detection of BRG1 (SMARCA4) expression in tissue
samples.
2. Responsibility Designated laboratory technologists are
responsible for performing the technical aspects of the BRG1
(SMARCA4) immunostain as detailed in this protocol. It is the
responsibility of the laboratory technologists to follow all steps
accurately and to report any irregularities or deviations to the
supervising pathologist.
3. Definitions BRG1 (SMARCA4) immunostain refers to the
immunohistochemical staining procedure used to detect the
presence of BRG1 (SMARCA4) protein in tissue sections. This
stain is crucial for diagnosing certain cancers and other medical
conditions.
4. Specimen Requirements
◦ Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks are
required.
◦ Tissue sections should be cut at 4 microns.
5. Reagents and Supplies
◦ BRG1 (SMARCA4) primary antibody
◦ Secondary antibody (species-specific)
◦ Detection system (e.g., HRP-conjugated detection system)
◦ Chromogen substrate (e.g., DAB)
◦ Counterstain (e.g., hematoxylin)
◦ Xylene and ethanol for dehydration and rehydration
◦ Mounting medium and coverslips
◦ Positive control slide (tissue known to express BRG1)
◦ Negative control slide (without primary antibody)
6. Equipment
◦ Microtome
◦ Water bath
◦ Incubator at 37°C
◦ Humidity chamber
◦ Light microscope
◦ Automated immunostainer (if available)
7. Procedure
A. Tissue Sectioning
1. Start by cutting 4-micron sections from the FFPE tissue
blocks using a microtome.
2. Place each section onto charged microscope slides.
3. Dry the slides in an incubator at 37°C overnight or at 60°C
for 1 hour.
B. Deparaffinization and Rehydration
1. Deparaffinize sections by placing them in xylene for 2
changes of 5 minutes each.
2. Rehydrate sections through a series of graded ethanol
solutions (100%, 95%, 80%) for 3 minutes each, followed
by rinsing in distilled water.
C. Antigen Retrieval
1. Perform heat-induced epitope retrieval (HIER) by placing
slides in a suitable antigen retrieval buffer (e.g., citrate
buffer, pH 6.0) and heating in a microwave, pressure
cooker, or water bath for 20 minutes.
2. Allow slides to cool for 20 minutes at room temperature
before washing with PBS (phosphate-buffered saline).
D. Immunostaining
1. Apply a hydrophobic barrier around tissue sections using
a PAP pen.
2. Block endogenous peroxidase activity by incubating slides
in 3% hydrogen peroxide for 10 minutes. Rinse in PBS.
3. Block non-specific binding sites by incubating slides with
blocking solution (e.g., 10% normal serum) for 20
minutes.
4. Incubate sections with BRG1 (SMARCA4) primary
antibody at the recommended dilution (as per
manufacturer's instructions) for 1 hour at room
temperature in a humidity chamber.
5. Wash slides in PBS for 3 x 5 minutes.
6. Incubate with species-specific secondary antibody for 30
minutes at room temperature. Wash in PBS for 3 x 5
minutes.
7. Apply the detection system (HRP-conjugated) and
incubate as per manufacturer's instructions. Wash in PBS
for 3 x 5 minutes.
8. Develop the chromogen (e.g., DAB) by incubating slides
for 5-10 minutes until the desired staining intensity is
achieved. Rinse in distilled water.
E. Counterstaining and Mounting
1. Counterstain with hematoxylin for 1-3 minutes. Rinse in
tap water.
2. Dehydrate sections through graded ethanol solutions
(80%, 95%, 100%) for 3 minutes each.
3. Clear in xylene for 2 changes of 5 minutes each.
4. Mount sections with mounting medium and coverslips.
8. Quality Control
◦ Include a positive control slide (tissue known to express
BRG1) and a negative control slide (without primary
antibody) with each batch of staining.
◦ Ensure that all reagent and antibody expiry dates are
checked before use.
◦ Document all reagent lot numbers and any deviations from
the protocol.
9. Interpretation of Results
◦ The presence of BRG1 (SMARCA4) expression is indicated
by a brown chromogen precipitate in the nucleus of the
cells.
◦ The intensity and pattern of staining should be evaluated by
a pathologist, and any diagnostic interpretations should be
made based on the context of the clinical history and
additional pathological findings.
10. Documentation and Reporting
• Record all steps and observations in the laboratory information
system (LIS).
• Ensure proper documentation of control outcomes and any
deviations from the established procedure.
• Report technical results to the supervising pathologist for
diagnostic interpretation.
