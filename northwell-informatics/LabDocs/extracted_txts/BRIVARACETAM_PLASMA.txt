Protocol for the Analytical Phase of Generating Results for
Brivaracetam, Plasma
1. PURPOSE
To detail the steps for the measurement and analysis of brivaracetam
levels in plasma to ensure accurate and consistent results.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of all trained laboratory personnel to follow
these procedures accurately. The laboratory supervisors are
responsible for ensuring that all procedures are followed and
validated.
1. DEFINITION
Brivaracetam is an anticonvulsant medication used primarily in the
adjunctive treatment of partial onset seizures. It is measured in
plasma to monitor therapeutic levels and ensure patient safety.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) system or
Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)
system
• Calibrators and Control solutions for brivaracetam
• HPLC-grade water, acetonitrile, and other solvents
• Plasma collection tubes containing EDTA or heparin
• Pipettes and disposable pipette tips
• Centrifuge
• Sample vials for HPLC or LC-MS/MS analysis
• Laboratory Information System (LIS)
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform calibration of the measurement equipment daily and after
any service or maintenance.
• Use two levels of control materials (low and high) to verify
calibration accuracy. Record control results for quality assurance.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Collection and Preparation
• Ensure plasma specimens are collected in EDTA or heparinized
tubes.
• Store collected plasma at -20°C if not analyzed immediately.
• Thaw frozen specimens at room temperature before analysis.
Vortex to mix.
B. Sample Preparation
• Pipette 0.2 mL of plasma into a centrifuge tube.
• Add 0.2 mL of internal standard solution to the plasma, vortex for
30 seconds.
• Add 1 mL of acetonitrile to precipitate proteins, vortex briefly.
• Centrifuge the mixture at 13,000 rpm for 10 minutes at 10°C.
• Transfer the supernatant to an HPLC or LC-MS/MS sample vial
for analysis.
C. Instrument Setup and Calibration
• Set-up the HPLC or LC-MS/MS system according to the
manufacturer’s guidelines.
• Prepare calibration standards ranging from 5 ng/mL to 500 ng/mL
of brivaracetam in plasma.
• Load calibration standards, quality controls, and prepared
samples into the autosampler.
• Using the system software, create a run sequence including
calibration standards, controls, and patient samples.
D. Analysis
• Initiate the run sequence on the HPLC or LC-MS/MS system.
• Review chromatograms for each sample. Confirm the retention
time and peak area of brivaracetam.
• Ensure assay performance by verifying that calibrators and quality
control samples meet specified criteria.
E. Data Analysis
• Use the instrument software to quantify brivaracetam
concentration in patient samples based on the calibration curve.
• Review and verify the results for accuracy.
• Transfer results to the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results are to be reviewed and verified by a medical technologist.
• Report the brivaracetam plasma levels in ng/mL.
• Document any issues or anomalies detected during analysis.
• Follow the clinic’s reporting guidelines for flagging critical or out-
of-range values.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
The therapeutic reference intervals for brivaracetam are specific to
the clinical context. Refer to the most current clinical guidelines or
literature for these ranges.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• The accuracy of brivaracetam measurement is dependent on
sample collection, proper instrument calibration, and adherence to
the procedural steps.
• Ensure no interference from other medications or substances that
the patient may be taking.
• Refer to the analytical instrument's user manual for any method-
specific limitations.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions for the HPLC or LC-MS/MS system.
• Current clinical guidelines for the therapeutic monitoring of
brivaracetam.
• Peer-reviewed literature on brivaracetam analysis in plasma.
This protocol should be reviewed periodically and updated as
necessary to ensure accuracy and efficiency in the analysis of
brivaracetam levels in plasma.
Note: This protocol does not replace the importance of professional
judgment and compliance with regulatory standards and guidelines.
