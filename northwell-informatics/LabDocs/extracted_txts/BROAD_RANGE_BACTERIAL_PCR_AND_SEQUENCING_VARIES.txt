Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Broad Range Bacterial
PCR and Sequencing
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedure for performing
broad range bacterial PCR and sequencing to detect and identify
bacterial pathogens in clinical samples.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel trained in
performing broad range bacterial PCR and sequencing. The process
includes DNA extraction, amplification of bacterial DNA, sequencing,
and interpretation of results.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
Laboratory technologists are responsible for carrying out this
procedure and ensuring that all steps are followed accurately.
Supervisors are responsible for overseeing the process, ensuring
quality control, and troubleshooting any issues that may arise.
4. SPECIMEN
Preferred/acceptable:
• Appropriate clinical specimens (e.g., blood, tissue, cerebrospinal
fluid, swabs) collected and handled using standard
microbiological procedures.
Unacceptable:
• Specimen not meeting the required volume.
• Specimens with inappropriate collection, storage, or transport
conditions.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Thermal cycler
• PCR reagents (Master mix, primers, nucleotides, Taq polymerase)
• DNA extraction kit
• Nuclease-free water
• Pipettes and tips
• Microcentrifuge
• Agarose gel electrophoresis system
• DNA sequencing instrument
• Sequencing reagents and supplies
• Laboratory notebook or electronic documentation system
6. DEFINITIONS
Broad Range Bacterial PCR: A PCR method that targets conserved
regions of bacterial DNA, allowing for the amplification of a wide
range of bacterial species. Sequencing: The process of determining
the nucleotide sequence of a DNA fragment to identify the bacterial
species.
7. PROCEDURE
A) DNA Extraction
1. Extract DNA from the clinical specimen using an appropriate
DNA extraction kit according to the manufacturer's instructions.
2. Quantify and assess the quality of the extracted DNA.
B) PCR Amplification
1. Prepare the PCR master mix:
◦ Nuclease-free water
◦ PCR buffer (with MgCl2, if required)
◦ dNTPs
◦ Forward and reverse primers targeting conserved bacterial
regions (e.g., 16S rRNA gene)
◦ Taq DNA polymerase
◦ Template DNA
2. Mix the components gently and aliquot the master mix into PCR
tubes.
3. Add template DNA to each tube.
4. Include a positive control (known bacterial DNA) and a negative
control (nuclease-free water) in each run.
5. Place the tubes in the thermal cycler and run the PCR program:
◦ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 5 minutes
◦ Denaturation: 95°C for 30 seconds
◦ Annealing: 55-60°C for 30 seconds (temperature depends
on the primers used)
◦ Extension: 72°C for 1 minute
◦ Final extension: 72°C for 10 minutes
◦ Hold: 4°C
C) PCR Product Verification
1. Verify the presence and size of the PCR products using
agarose gel electrophoresis.
2. Load the PCR products and appropriate DNA ladder on the
agarose gel.
3. Run the gel and visualize the bands under UV light.
4. Document the results of the gel electrophoresis.
D) DNA Sequencing
1. Purify the PCR products using a PCR purification kit.
2. Quantify the purified PCR products.
3. Set up the sequencing reaction using the purified PCR product
as the template and appropriate sequencing primers.
4. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for the sequencing
instrument and reagents.
5. Load the sequencing reaction on the sequencer and start the
sequencing run.
E) Data Analysis
1. Analyze the sequencing data using appropriate bioinformatics
tools.
2. Compare the sequences against a reference database (e.g.,
NCBI BLAST) to identify the bacterial species.
3. Document the sequencing results and interpretations.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include appropriate positive and negative controls in each PCR
and sequencing run.
• Follow the laboratory's quality assurance protocols for equipment
calibration and maintenance.
• Document all steps, observations, and results in the laboratory
notebook or electronic documentation system.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
• Review and verify the sequencing results.
• Report the identification of bacterial species to the requesting
clinician or department.
• Include information on the specimen, method used, and any
relevant clinical interpretation.

• Manufacturer's instructions for DNA extraction kit.
• Manufacturer's instructions for PCR reagents and thermal cycler.
• Manufacturer's instructions for DNA sequencing reagents and
instrument.
• Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines for
molecular diagnostic methods.
11. SAFETY
• Follow standard laboratory safety protocols, including the use of
personal protective equipment (PPE).
• Handle all clinical specimens as potentially infectious.
• Dispose of waste materials according to the laboratory's safety
and environmental protocols.
12. DOCUMENTATION
• Record all pertinent information, including specimen details,
reagent lot numbers, and control results, in the laboratory
information system (LIS) or laboratory notebook.
13. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If PCR amplification fails, review the reagent quality, reaction
setup, and thermal cycler conditions.
• If sequencing results are unclear or of poor quality, ensure the
DNA product is of sufficient quantity and purity, and repeat the
sequencing run if necessary.
• Consult with the supervisor for any persistent issues or
uncertainties.
This protocol provides a comprehensive framework for the analytical
phase of generating results for broad range bacterial PCR and
sequencing. Ensure that all laboratory personnel are familiar with and
follow this SOP to maintain consistency and accuracy in the analysis.
