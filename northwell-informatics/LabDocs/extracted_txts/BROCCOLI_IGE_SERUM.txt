Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for BROCCOLI, IGE,
SERUM
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to provide detailed instructions on
the analytical phase of generating results for BROCCOLI-specific
Immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels in serum. This includes the steps
necessary to ensure accurate and reliable results, including
specimen and reagent handling, equipment usage, and result
reporting.
1. PRINCIPLE
This assay is designed to quantitatively measure the specific IgE
antibodies against BROCCOLI in human serum. The principle utilizes
an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or similar
immunoassay technology.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
◦ Specimen Type: Human serum
◦ Collection Tube: SST (Serum Separator Tube) or Red-top
tube
◦ Volume Required: Minimum 1 mL of serum
◦ Stability: Serum should be separated from cells within 2
hours of collection and stored at 2-8℃ for up to 48 hours; for
long-term storage, specimens should be frozen at -20℃ or
lower.
2. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
◦ ELISA microplate reader
◦ Centrifuge
◦ Automated pipettes and tips
◦ Vortex mixer
◦ Incubator set at 37℃ (if required by the assay)
◦ Reagent kit specific for BROCCOLI IgE (containing
microplates, controls, standards, conjugate, substrate, stop
solution, and wash buffer)
◦ Microplate washer (optional but recommended)
◦ Timer
3. REAGENT PREPARATION
◦ Allow all reagents to reach room temperature (20-25℃)
before use.
◦ Prepare wash buffer as indicated by the manufacturer’s
instructions (if using concentrate, dilute appropriately with
deionized water).
◦ Reconstitute standards and controls as per manufacturer's
instructions.
4. CALIBRATION AND QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Run standards in duplicates in every assay run.
◦ Include both positive and negative controls in every assay.
◦ Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for the preparation
and use of quality control material.
5. ANALYTICAL PROCEDURE
1. Sample Preparation
▪ Thaw frozen specimens at room temperature.
▪ Centrifuge all samples at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes to
remove any particulate matter.
▪ Pipette required serum volume into the assay plate
wells as per the assay protocol.
2. Assay Procedure
▪ Add standards, controls, and samples to the wells
according to the plate map.
▪ Incubate according to the times and temperatures
specified in the assay kit insert.
▪ Perform addition of conjugate, substrate, and stop
solution as instructed in kit protocol.
▪ Wash wells between steps using the wash buffer,
ensuring complete removal of residual fluids.
3. Reading the Plate
▪ Set the microplate reader to the specific wavelength
required (commonly 450 nm with a reference filter at
620 nm).
▪ Read and record optical densities (OD) of each well.
6. RESULT CALCULATION AND INTERPRETATION
◦ Generate a standard curve by plotting the OD values of the
standards against their corresponding concentration.
◦ Calculate the concentration of BROCCOLI-specific IgE in
the patient samples by interpolating from the standard
curve.
◦ Ensure all control results are within the acceptable range.
◦ Interpret results in the context of clinical history and other
laboratory findings.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ Report results in kU/L.
◦ Include reference ranges and interpretative comments
based on established clinical guidelines.
◦ Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
and verify before transmitting to the clinician.
8. QUALITY ASSURANCE
• Ensure periodic calibration and maintenance of the ELISA reader,
pipettes, and other equipment.
• Perform proficiency testing as required.
• Document all quality control measures, maintenance, and
calibration activities.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If quality control results fall outside acceptable limits, review and
repeat the assay.
• Check for common issues such as pipetting errors, reagent
contamination, and equipment malfunction.
• Consult the manufacturer’s troubleshooting guide for additional
assistance.

specific IgE testing.
By following this SOP, the laboratory ensures consistent and accurate
measurement of BROCCOLI-specific IgE, thereby providing reliable
data for clinical decision-making.
