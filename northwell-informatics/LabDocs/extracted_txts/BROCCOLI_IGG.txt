Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for BROCCOLI IGG Analysis
1. PURPOSE
To provide standardized procedures for measuring and analyzing
BROCCOLI IGG (Immunoglobulin G) in patient serum samples to
ensure accurate, consistent, and reliable results.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
All laboratory technologists are responsible for following this
procedure to ensure the precision, accuracy, and quality of
BROCCOLI IGG testing.
1. DEFINITION
BROCCOLI IGG refers to specific immunoglobulin G antibodies
present in the serum that may indicate sensitivity or immune
response to broccoli.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Serum.
• Collection: Collect blood in a red-top tube (no anticoagulant).
Ensure proper mixing.
• Handling: Allow blood to clot at room temperature for 30 minutes.
Centrifuge at 1500-2000 x g for 10 minutes. Pipette serum into a
labeled aliquot tube.
• Stability: Store serum at 2-8°C if analysis will be performed within
7 days. For long-term storage, freeze serum at -20°C or below
until analysis.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• ELISA Plate Reader with appropriate filters
• Microplate Washer
• Micropipettes and tips
• ELISA Plates
• Dilution Buffer
• Washing Buffer
• Substrate Solution (TMB)
• Stop Solution (Sulfuric Acid or equivalent)
• BROCCOLI IGG Standard and Control Serum
• BROCCOLI IGG Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)
Kit
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation
1. Allow all reagents and samples to reach room temperature
(~20-25°C) before starting the assay.
2. Prepare the required number of wells in the ELISA plate
according to the number of samples, standards, and controls to
be tested.
B. Sample and Reagent Addition
1. Pipette 100 µL of standard, control, and serum samples into
their respective wells in duplicates.
2. Add 100 µL of dilution buffer into the blank wells.
3. Add 100 µL of enzyme conjugate to each well, cover the plate,
and incubate at room temperature for 1 hour.
C. Washing
1. After incubation, discard the contents of the wells and wash the
plate three times with washing buffer. Ensure wells are
completely empty after each wash.
D. Substrate Addition
1. Add 100 µL of TMB substrate solution to each well.
2. Incubate the plate in the dark for 15-30 minutes at room
temperature.
E. Stopping the Reaction
1. Add 100 µL of stop solution to each well to terminate the
enzyme-substrate reaction. The color will change from blue to
yellow.
F. Reading the Plate
1. Measure the absorbance of the wells using an ELISA plate
reader set to 450 nm (reference wavelength: 620-630 nm is
optional).
2. CALCULATION OF RESULTS
3. Generate a standard curve by plotting the mean absorbance for
each standard dilution on the y-axis against the corresponding
concentration on the x-axis using a linear/linear or log/log fit.
4. Compute the concentration of BROCCOLI IGG in patient
samples by interpolating their absorbance values against the
standard curve.
5. Report results in IU/mL.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
7. Run the internal controls alongside each batch of samples.
Controls should fall within the established range provided in the
kit instructions.
8. If controls are out of range, do not report patient results.
Investigate the issue, recalibrate the assay, and retest the
samples.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
10. Verify and review all results before reporting.
11. Document results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
and ensure results are properly communicated to the
healthcare providers.
12. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the specific BROCCOLI IGG ELISA kit insert for details on
potential assay limitations, interfering substances, and other relevant
technical information.
