Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Analytical Phase for
Generating Results for Brome Grass, IgE, Serum
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the procedure for the determination of
Immunoglobulin E (IgE) specific to Brome Grass (BROMUS
INERMIS) in serum samples using Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent
Assay (ELISA) or Chemiluminescent Immunoassay (CLIA)
techniques.
1. SCOPE
This protocol applies to all laboratory personnel conducting serum
IgE assays for Brome Grass allergen in the Immunology Department.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
• Designated Certified Medical Laboratory Scientists (MLS) are
responsible for performing the assay and ensuring all procedures
and documentation are completed.
• The laboratory supervisor is responsible for ensuring compliance
with this SOP and for troubleshooting any issues that arise.
1. DEFINITION
Brome Grass IgE: A specific IgE antibody produced as part of an
allergic response to Brome Grass (Bromus inermis).
1. PROCEDURE
5.1 Reagent Preparation
• Prepare all reagents and calibrators as per manufacturer's
instructions.
• Bring all reagents to room temperature before use.
5.2 Equipment Preparation
• Calibrate the ELISA reader or CLIA analyzer according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
• Ensure that the temperature (20-26°C) and humidity (15-85%) are
within acceptable limits for the equipment and reagents.
5.3 Specimen Preparation
• Serum samples must be centrifuged and separated from the clot
within 2 hours of collection.
• Store serum samples at 2-8°C if tested within 48 hours, or freeze
at -20°C or lower for longer storage.
5.4 Test Procedure
ELISA method:
1. Sample and Reagent Addition: a. Label the required number
of microtiter wells for patient samples and controls. b. Add 100
µL of standards, controls, and patient samples to designated
wells. c. Incubate at room temperature for the specified time
according to the kit instructions.
2. Washing Steps: a. Aspirate and wash the wells using a wash
buffer as per kit instructions. b. Repeat the washing steps as
per instructions to remove unbound substances.
3. Enzyme Conjugate Addition: a. Add 100 µL of enzyme
conjugate to each well. b. Incubate for the specified time at
room temperature.
4. Substrate Addition: a. Following the washing steps, add the
appropriate substrate solution to each well. b. Incubate at room
temperature for the specified time, usually 10-30 minutes.
5. Stop Reaction: a. Add stop solution to each well to halt the
enzyme-substrate reaction. b. Read the absorbance at the
appropriate wavelength (typically 450 nm) within 30 minutes.
CLIA method:
1. Sample and Control Preparation: a. Load serum samples,
standards, and controls into designated positions on the CLIA
analyzer.
2. Programming Analyzer: a. Select the Brome Grass IgE assay
program on the CLIA analyzer.
3. Automated Analysis: a. The CLIA analyzer will automatically
add reagents, incubate, wash, and measure the
chemiluminescent signal. b. The analyzer generates results
based on the signal intensity.
5.5 Result Reporting:
• Transmit results to the Laboratory Information System (LIS) for
review.
• Review the generated data for quality and ensure all controls are
within predefined ranges before result verification.
• Report the results in accordance with site-specific guidelines.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include controls with known concentrations in each assay run.
• Ensure calibration and QC results fall within the acceptable
ranges as specified by the manufacturer.
• Document any deviations and take corrective actions as
necessary.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Reference intervals for Brome Grass IgE will be provided by the
assay manufacturer and should be adhered to.
• Typically, values may be presented in kU/L as per standard
allergen-specific IgE reporting.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Ensure to follow kit insert instructions for detailed limitations.
• Consider any interfering substances or potential cross-reactivity
identified in the assay instructions.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING
• Refer to the detailed troubleshooting guide provided by the assay
manufacturer for any issues encountered during the assay.
• Notify the supervisor for persistent issues or when external
technical support is required.
