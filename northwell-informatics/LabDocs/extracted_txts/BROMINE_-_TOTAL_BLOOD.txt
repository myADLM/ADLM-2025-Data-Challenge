STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP) FOR ANALYSIS OF
BROMINE - TOTAL IN BLOOD
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to provide a standardized protocol for the
analysis of Bromine - Total in blood specimens. This protocol ensures
accuracy and consistency in generating results for Bromine - Total in
blood, critical for patient diagnosis and treatment.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all trained laboratory staff to perform Bromine
- Total analysis following this SOP accurately and safely. All staff
should report any discrepancies or issues encountered during the
analysis to the supervising laboratory technologist or manager.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen Type: Whole blood collected in a trace element-free
container such as a royal blue-top (EDTA) tube.
Specimen Handling: - After collection, specimens should be mixed
thoroughly and kept at room temperature until analysis. - Specimens
should be transported to the laboratory immediately following
collection.
Specimen Stability: - Specimens are stable for up to 72 hours at
room temperature. If analysis will be delayed, specimens may be
refrigerated (2-8°C) and are stable for up to 7 days.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
Equipment: - Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer (ICP-
MS) - Centrifuge - Trace element-free containers (royal blue-top
EDTA tubes) - Micropipettes and tips - Laboratory glassware and
analytical balance
Reagents: - Calibration standards for Bromine - High purity water
(Type I) - Nitric acid (trace metal grade) - Internal standard solution
5. PROCEDURE
5.1. Preparation
Prepare Calibration Standards: - Prepare Bromine calibration
standards by diluting stock solutions to the desired concentration
range. - Ensure that calibration standards cover the expected range
of Bromine concentrations in blood specimens.
Prepare Internal Standard Solution: - Prepare internal standard
solution (such as Indium or another suitable internal standard) for use
in ICP-MS analysis.
Prepare Sample Preparation Solutions: - Prepare a 1% nitric acid
solution for sample preparation.
5.2. Sample Preparation
Whole Blood Specimens: - Centrifuge blood specimens at 1500 x g
for 10 minutes to separate plasma. - Collect the plasma layer,
avoiding contamination from the buffy coat or red blood cells. - Dilute
plasma 1:10 with 1% nitric acid.
5.3. Instrument Settings and Calibration
ICP-MS Settings: - Set up the ICP-MS according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. - Verify that the instrument is calibrated
correctly, and perform routine maintenance checks.
Calibration Curve: - Run prepared calibration standards to generate a
calibration curve, ensuring linearity within the expected range of
Bromine concentrations.
5.4. Analytical Run
Analyzing Samples: - Analyze each prepared plasma sample using
ICP-MS. - Include internal standard in each sample analysis for
quantification.
Quality Control: - Run quality control samples alongside patient
samples to ensure analytical validity. - Include blank samples and
control samples with known Bromine concentrations within each
analytical run.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
QC Materials: - Use QC materials that contain Bromine at two
different concentration levels. - Store QC materials according to
manufacturer’s instructions and verify their stability.
QC Procedure: - Perform QC analysis with each batch of patient
specimens. - Review QC results to ensure they fall within predefined
acceptable ranges. If QC fails, troubleshoot and do not report patient
results until QC passes.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
Review and Verification: - Review all generated results for accuracy
and verify adherence to quality control guidelines. - Document any
issues or deviations from the SOP and take corrective actions as
needed.
Documentation: - Enter results into the Laboratory Information
System (LIS). - Report unusual findings and critical values to the
attending physician immediately.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to ICP-MS manufacturer's insert and Bromine calibration
standard insert for specific limitations.
Potential Interferences: - Ensure that analytical calibration is precise
to mitigate interference from other elements. - Recognize that
hemolysis and lipemia can affect bromine measurement, and apply
corrective factors if necessary.
