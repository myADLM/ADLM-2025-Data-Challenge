BRUCELLA ANTIBODY SCREEN, IgM AND IgG, ELISA, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is to define
the analytical steps for the detection of Brucella antibodies (IgM and
IgG) in serum using Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)
method.
1. SCOPE
This protocol applies to the performance of Brucella Antibody Screen
(IgM and IgG) ELISA assays in the laboratory. This SOP ensures
consistent and reliable results.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
• Laboratory personnel trained in ELISA techniques are responsible
for performing the Brucella Antibody Screen (IgM and IgG) ELISA
assays.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring that all designated staff
have adequate training and that they follow this procedure
accurately.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen type: Serum
• Preferred/acceptable: 5-10 mL blood collected in a serum
separator tube (SST). Centrifuge to obtain serum.
• Unacceptable: Hemolyzed, icteric, or lipemic samples. Samples
that have been frozen and thawed multiple times.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• ELISA microplate reader
• Micropipettes (variable volumes)
• Multichannel pipette
• Calibrated timer
• Incubator (37°C)
• Centrifuge
• Brucella Antibody ELISA Kit (IgM and IgG)
• Wash buffer
• Substrate solution (e.g., TMB)
• Stop solution (e.g., sulfuric acid)
• Positive control serum
• Negative control serum
• Deionized or distilled water
• Disposable pipette tips
• Microplate washer (optional)
1. PROCEDURE
6.1. Preparation of Reagents
• All reagents should be brought to room temperature (18-25°C)
before starting the assay.
• Prepare wash buffer by diluting the concentrated wash solution as
per manufacturer's instructions.
6.2. Sample Preparation
• Allow serum samples and control to reach room temperature.
• Vortex samples briefly to ensure homogeneity.
6.3. Plate Setup
• Label the microplate with appropriate sample and control
identifications.
• Add 100 µL of standard, control, and sample per well according to
the plate layout provided by the kit manufacturer. Run each
sample, standard, and control in duplicate.
6.4. Incubation
• Incubate the plate for 1 hour at 37°C or as specified by the kit
manufacturer.
6.5. Washing
• Wash the wells five times with wash buffer, using either a
configured plate washer or manually with a multichannel pipette.
Ensure complete removal of liquid after each wash.
6.6. Addition of Conjugate
• Add 100 µL of enzyme conjugate into each well.
• Incubate the plate for 30 minutes at room temperature.
6.7. Washing
• Repeat the washing step as described in 6.5.
6.8. Addition of Substrate
• Add 100 µL of substrate solution into each well.
• Incubate the plate in the dark for 10-15 minutes at room
temperature (18-25°C). Watch for the development of color.
6.9. Stopping the Reaction
• Add 50 µL of stop solution into each well. The color will change
from blue to yellow.
6.10. Reading the Plate
• Read the absorbance of each well at 450 nm using the ELISA
microplate reader within 30 minutes of adding the stop solution.
• Record the optical density (OD) values.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run positive and negative controls with every batch of tests to
ensure assay integrity.
• Maintain a lot-to-lot consistency check for critical reagents.
1. RESULT CALCULATION
• Calculate average OD values for each standard, control, and test
sample.
• Generate a standard curve by plotting the OD values against the
concentration of standards.
• Determine the concentration of IgM and IgG antibodies in the test
samples using the standard curve.
• Report the samples as:
◦ Negative: OD values less than the cut-off value provided.
◦ Positive: OD values greater than the cut-off value provided
indicating the presence of Brucella IgM or IgG antibodies.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results must be documented and reviewed before the final
verification by the technologist.
• Follow laboratory-specific guidelines for entering results into the
Laboratory Information System (LIS).
1. LIMITATIONS
• Results must be interpreted in conjunction with clinical and other
laboratory findings.
• False positives/negatives can occur due to cross-reactivity or
assay interference.
