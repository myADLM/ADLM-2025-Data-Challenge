Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for BRUCELLA TOTAL
ANTIBODY CONFIRMATION, AGGLUTINATION, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
To outline standardized procedures for the confirmation of
Brucella total antibody presence using the agglutination method
in serum samples.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory personnel trained in serology perform the
testing, adhere to the protocol, and document results.
• Supervisors ensure adherence to SOPs and address
discrepancies in test outcomes promptly.
1. DEFINITION
Agglutination: A serological test that involves the clumping of
particles, typically used to detect the presence and concentration of
antibodies against Brucella in the serum.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen Type:
• Serum collected via venipuncture using appropriate blood
collection tubes.
Specimen Stability:
• Serum is stable for up to 48 hours at 2-8°C.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed specimens.
• Specimens collected in anticoagulant tubes other than specified
serum collection tubes.
• Specimens stored past the stability period.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Brucella antigen reagent
• Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)
• Test tubes or microtiter plates
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Incubator set to 37°C
• Rotator for mixing
• Timer
• Laboratory refrigerator (2-8°C storage)
• Disposable gloves and lab coat for personal protection
1. PROCEDURE
Pre-analytical Phase: Ensure specimen collection, handling, and
storage comply with laboratory standards.
Analytical Phase:
Preparing Reagents:
• Thaw frozen reagents and bring them to room temperature.
• Dilute Brucella antigen reagent with PBS to the required
concentration as specified in the reagent insert.
Performing the Test:
1. Sample Preparation:
◦ Allow serum specimens to come to room temperature
before analysis.
◦ Label tubes or microtiter wells to identify patient specimens
and controls.
2. Agglutination Reaction Setup:
◦ Add specified volume of PBS to each test tube or microtiter
well.
◦ Add a defined volume of patient serum into respective test
tubes or wells.
◦ Include positive and negative controls in the testing series.
3. Agglutination Procedure:
◦ Add Brucella antigen reagent to each tube or well containing
serum and PBS.
◦ Mix the contents thoroughly using a rotator for 2 minutes.
◦ Incubate the reaction mixture at 37°C for 1 hour.
4. Reading Results:
◦ After incubation, examine the mixtures for agglutination
under appropriate lighting conditions.
◦ Compare the observed reactions against the positive and
negative controls.
◦ Record the level of agglutination with corresponding grading
scale: 0 (no agglutination), 1+, 2+, 3+, 4+ (strong
agglutination).
5. Interpretation:
◦ Positive Result: Presence of agglutination indicates
antibodies against Brucella in the serum sample.
◦ Negative Result: Lack of agglutination indicates absence of
detectable Brucella antibodies.
6. Troubleshooting:
◦ If the positive control does not show expected agglutination,
verify reagent quality and repeat the test.
◦ Ensure negative controls remain agglutination-free to rule
out non-specific reactions.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
Regular Testing: - Perform quality control using known positive and
negative control sera. - Document all control results for review by
supervisory personnel.
Reagent Validation: - Validate each new batch of Brucella antigen
reagent by testing with control sera prior to routine use.
Temperature and Equipment Monitoring: - Ensure all temperature-
sensitive steps and incubations are meticulously monitored and
documented. - Maintain calibration records for all equipment used in
the test.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
Documentation: - Record all observations in the laboratory
information system (LIS) with patient identification. - Verify and sign-
off results prior to reporting.
Critical Results: - Immediate reporting of positive results to the
ordering physician, particularly in cases suggestive of active
infection. - Document all communications and note repeat critical
values according to laboratory policy.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Agglutination: - Negative: Grade 0 (no agglutination) - Positive:
Grade 1+, 2+, 3+, 4+ (indicating varying levels of antibody presence)
1. LIMITATIONS
Interferences: - Hemolyzed or lipemic specimens may yield
inaccurate results. - Prolonged storage beyond stability period may
affect antibody levels.
