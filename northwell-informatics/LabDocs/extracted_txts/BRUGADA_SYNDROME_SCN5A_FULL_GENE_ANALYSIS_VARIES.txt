Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
SCN5A Full Gene Analysis for Brugada Syndrome
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to provide a standardized workflow and
ensure accuracy in the molecular diagnosis of Brugada Syndrome by
analyzing the SCN5A gene, which encodes the cardiac sodium
channel. This protocol outlines the steps for the analytical phase,
including DNA extraction, PCR amplification, sequencing, data
analysis, and result reporting.
RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the designated molecular genetic
technologists to perform and document each step of the procedure
accurately. The laboratory supervisor is responsible for ensuring
compliance with the SOP and addressing any issues that may arise.
1. MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT
• Reagents:
◦ DNA extraction kit (e.g., Qiagen, Promega)
◦ PCR reagents (e.g., Taq polymerase, dNTPs, primers specific
for SCN5A)
◦ Sequencing reagents (e.g., BigDye Terminator v3.1,
purification kit)
• Equipment:
◦ Automated or manual DNA extractor
◦ Thermocycler for PCR
◦ Agarose gel electrophoresis system
◦ DNA sequencer (e.g., ABI 3500 Genetic Analyzer)
◦ Computer with sequence analysis software (e.g., Sequencher,
Mutation Surveyor)
1. PROCEDURE
A. DNA Extraction
1. Sample Preparation
◦ Verify the identity of the specimen using the patient’s unique
identifier.
◦ Ensure the specimen is suitable (e.g., whole blood, buccal
swab).
2. DNA Isolation
◦ Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for the selected DNA
extraction kit.
◦ Elute the DNA in the recommended volume of elution buffer
or water.
◦ Measure the DNA concentration using a spectrophotometer.
◦ Store DNA at -20°C until further analysis.
B. PCR Amplification
1. Primer Design and Validation
◦ Design primers to amplify all exons and flanking intronic
regions of the SCN5A gene.
◦ Validate primer specificity and efficiency.
2. PCR Setup
◦ Prepare the PCR mix as per the optimized protocol. Include
master mix, primers, template DNA, and nuclease-free
water.
◦ Program the thermocycler with the appropriate cycling
parameters.
3. Amplification
◦ Load the PCR tubes/plates into the thermocycler and start
the amplification process.
◦ Include a no-template control and positive control in each
PCR run.
4. Agarose Gel Electrophoresis
◦ Run an aliquot of the PCR product on an agarose gel to
confirm successful amplification.
◦ Document the gel image for comparison and quality control.
C. Sequencing
1. PCR Product Purification
◦ Purify the PCR products to remove unincorporated primers
and dNTPs using a suitable purification method (e.g.,
magnetic bead-based clean-up).
2. Sequencing Reaction
◦ Set up the sequencing reaction using the BigDye Terminator
v3.1 kit, with each purified PCR product and appropriate
sequencing primers.
◦ Follow the thermocycler program optimized for sequencing.
3. Post-Sequencing Purification
◦ Purify sequencing reaction products to remove excess dye
terminators.
4. Sequencing Run
◦ Load purified sequencing products into the DNA sequencer.
◦ Retrieve and store the raw sequencing data.
D. Data Analysis
1. Sequence Alignment
◦ Use sequence analysis software to align obtained
sequences to the reference SCN5A gene sequence.
◦ Ensure the complete coverage of all targeted regions.
2. Variant Identification and Annotation
◦ Identify any sequence variants using the analysis software.
◦ Annotate variants according to HGVS nomenclature.
◦ Compare identified variants with known SNPs and
pathogenic mutations in genomic databases (e.g., ClinVar,
dbSNP).
3. Interpretation
◦ Classify variants according to current guidelines for variant
interpretation (e.g., ACMG/AMP guidelines).
◦ Determine the clinical significance based on literature and
database review.
E. Reporting Results
1. Drafting Report
◦ Prepare a report summarizing the findings, including
identified variants, their predicted effect, and clinical
interpretation.
2. Review and Verification
◦ Submit the draft report for review by a senior technologist or
molecular geneticist.
◦ Verify the accuracy and completeness of the reported data.
3. Issuance of Report
◦ Finalize the report after verification.
◦ Submit the report to the clinician who ordered the test.
◦ Ensure proper documentation and storage of all test data
and reports in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
4. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform regular quality controls to ensure reagents and
equipment function optimally.
• Include positive and negative controls in every step of the
process.
• Conduct periodic proficiency testing and participate in external
quality assessment schemes.
5. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions for all reagents and equipment.
• Relevant guidelines for molecular genetic testing.
• Key literature on SCN5A and Brugada Syndrome.
6. DOCUMENTATION
• Document all steps in the laboratory notebook or LIS, including
DNA extraction, PCR, sequencing, and data analysis.
• Maintain records of quality control measures and corrective
actions taken.
7. SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS
• Follow standard laboratory biosafety and biosecurity protocols.
• Use personal protective equipment (PPE) as required.
• Handle all specimens as potentially infectious.
This protocol ensures the accurate and efficient generation of results
for the SCN5A full gene analysis, aiding in the diagnosis of Brugada
Syndrome.
