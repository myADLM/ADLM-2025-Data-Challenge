Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Brussels Sprouts IgE, Serum
1. PURPOSE
To outline the steps and responsibilities involved in the analytical
phase of generating results for Brussels Sprouts IgE, Serum.
The aim is to ensure accurate and reliable results by following proper
guidelines and maintaining quality control through each step of the
analytical phase.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel responsible for
performing and analyzing the Brussels Sprouts IgE, Serum test.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all clinical laboratory scientists and
technologists to follow this SOP, perform the test accurately, and
document all required information.
4. DEFINITIONS
Brussels Sprouts IgE, Serum: An allergen-specific immunoglobulin E
test to detect the presence of antibodies against Brussels sprouts in
the patient's serum.
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type: Serum Preferred Specimen: 2 mL serum collected in
a serum separator tube (SST).
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Serum that is hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric
• Serum collected in tubes containing anticoagulants like EDTA,
citrates, or heparin
6. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Immunoassay analyzer (e.g., ELISA reader)
• Serum separator tubes (SST)
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Plate washer (automated or manual)
• Brussels Sprouts IgE test kit (manufacturer specified)
• Calibrators and controls provided with the test kit
• Distilled or deionized water
• Timer
• Suitable disposal containers for biohazardous waste
7. PROCEDURE
7.1 Preparation
1. Perform all procedures in accordance with standard laboratory
safety protocols and wear appropriate personal protective
equipment (PPE).
2. Ensure serum samples are thoroughly mixed and brought to
room temperature before analysis.
7.2 Test Setup
1. Set up the ELISA plate according to the test kit manufacturer's
instructions.
2. Pipette the necessary volume of standards, controls, and
patient samples into the designated wells.
3. Add the reagents as indicated in the manufacturer’s
instructions.
7.3 Incubation
1. Cover the ELISA plate with a plate sealer to prevent
evaporation and contamination.
2. Incubate the plate at the temperature specified in the test kit
instructions for the recommended time.
7.4 Washing
1. Wash the plate to remove unbound substances. Use an
automated plate washer or wash manually as specified by the
kit instructions.
2. Make sure each well is adequately washed to prevent cross-
contamination or background interference.
7.5 Detection
1. Add the enzyme-linked detection reagent to each well.
2. Incubate the plate for the required time period and temperature
as specified.
7.6 Substrate Addition
1. Add the substrate solution to each well and incubate for the
specified time.
2. Observe for a color change indicating a positive reaction.
7.7 Stopping
1. Add the stop solution to each well to terminate the reaction.
2. Read the optical density (OD) of each well using an ELISA
reader set to the appropriate wavelength (e.g., 450 nm).
7.8 Calculation of Results
1. Calculate the results by generating a standard curve from the
OD values of the standards.
2. Use the standard curve to determine the concentration of
Brussels Sprouts IgE in each patient sample.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
8.1 Internal Quality Control
1. Run positive and negative controls provided within the test kit
alongside patient samples to ensure the assay's validity.
2. Document the control results. Take corrective actions if controls
fall outside acceptable limits as detailed in the test kit
instructions.
8.2 External Quality Assurance
1. Participate in external proficiency testing programs when
available.
2. Compare external proficiency results with the internal data to
ensure consistency and accuracy.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Record the concentrations of Brussels Sprouts IgE in the
laboratory information system (LIS).
2. Verify results by cross-checking with the control data.
3. Forward the verified results to the ordering physician or
appropriate healthcare provider.
10. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions for the Brussels Sprouts IgE, Serum
test kit.

11. DOCUMENTATION AND RECORD-KEEPING
1. Ensure all steps are documented in the laboratory logbook or
electronic system.
2. Retain records as per the laboratory’s policy and regulatory
requirements.
12. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If unexpected results or errors occur, refer to the troubleshooting
section of the test kit instructions.
• Contact the supervisor or laboratory manager for further
guidance.
