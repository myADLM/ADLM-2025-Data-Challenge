Protocol for Analytical Phase: BRUTON TYROSINE KINASE
(BTK), FULL GENE ANALYSIS
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedures for the accurate and efficient analysis of the
Bruton Tyrosine Kinase (BTK) gene to identify any mutations that
might contribute to disorder pathogenesis. This protocol ensures
consistency, reliability, and quality of results.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of qualified laboratory personnel to perform the
analysis following these procedures. All deviations from this protocol
must be documented and justified.
2. EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS
• Thermal Cycler
• Automated DNA Sequencer
• PCR Master Mix
• Primers specific to BTK gene exons and intron-exon boundaries
• DNA extraction kit
• Gel electrophoresis apparatus
• Agarose gel and running buffer
• Ethidium bromide or SYBR safe DNA stain
• Microcentrifuge
• Pipettes and sterile pipette tips
• PCR tubes and strip caps
• DNA ladder
• Positive and negative controls
3. SPECIMEN
Specimen Type: Peripheral blood, Bone marrow aspirate, or other
suitable tissue validated for BTK gene analysis.
Specimen Requirements and Stability:
• Submitted specimens must be received in an EDTA tube for blood
or validated tubes for other types of tissues.
• Specimens should be stored at 2-8°C if they are to be processed
within 24 hours, or at -20°C for long-term storage.
4. PROCEDURE
A. DNA Extraction:
1. DNA Extraction:
◦ Follow the protocol provided by the DNA extraction kit
manufacturer.
◦ Quantify the DNA using a spectrophotometer and evaluate
the purity (A260/A280 ratio).
B. PCR Amplification:
1. PCR Setup:
◦ Prepare PCR Master Mix according to the component
specifications.
◦ Add primers specific to BTK exons and intron-exon
boundaries.
◦ Aliquot 20-50 ng of genomic DNA to each PCR reaction
tube.
◦ Set appropriate cycling conditions in the thermal cycler
(denaturation, annealing, and extension steps).
C. Gel Electrophoresis:
1. Gel Electrophoresis:
◦ Prepare 1.5-2% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide
or SYBR safe.
◦ Load PCR products and a DNA ladder into the gel wells.
◦ Run electrophoresis at appropriate voltage until separation
is clear.
◦ Visualize and document the gel under UV illumination.
D. DNA Sequencing:
1. Sequencing:
◦ Purify the PCR products using a suitable purification kit.
◦ Quantify the purified PCR products using
spectrophotometry.
◦ Set up the sequencing reaction according to the automated
DNA sequencer protocol.
◦ Submit the samples for sequencing.
E. Data Analysis:
1. Data Analysis:
◦ Analyze sequencing results using appropriate bioinformatics
software.
◦ Compare sequences with reference BTK gene sequences to
identify any mutations.
◦ Validate suspicious findings through repeated sequencing or
alternative methods.
5. QUALITY CONTROL:
• Include positive (known BTK mutation) and negative (wild-type)
controls in each run.
• Analyze internal quality control materials and assess results per
laboratory standards.
• Document and investigate any deviations from expected control
results before processing patient samples.
6. REPORTING RESULTS:
• Interpret sequencing data and report identifiable BTK mutations.
• Record findings in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Ensure results undergo a review by a qualified technologist before
release.
• Provide explicit mutation details, including nucleotide changes
and predicted protein alterations.
