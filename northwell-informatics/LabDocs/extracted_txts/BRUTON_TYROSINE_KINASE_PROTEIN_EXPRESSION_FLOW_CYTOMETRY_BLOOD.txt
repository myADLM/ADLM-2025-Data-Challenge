Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): BRUTON TYROSINE
KINASE, PROTEIN EXPRESSION, FLOW CYTOMETRY, BLOOD
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to provide detailed instructions for the
analysis of Bruton Tyrosine Kinase (BTK) protein expression in blood
samples using flow cytometry. This procedure ensures accurate and
consistent results for diagnostic and research purposes.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing
and documenting this procedure according to the described
protocol.
• Supervisors are responsible for training personnel, ensuring
compliance, and addressing any deviations or issues.
1. SCOPE
This SOP applies to the analysis of BTK protein expression in
peripheral blood samples using flow cytometry in a CLIA-certified
laboratory.
1. DEFINITIONS
• BTK: Bruton Tyrosine Kinase, a protein involved in B-cell
development and functioning.
• Flow Cytometry: A technology used to analyze the physical and
chemical characteristics of cells or particles.
• Fluorochrome: A fluorescent compound used to label antibodies
for detection by flow cytometry.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Whole blood.
• Collection Tube: EDTA (lavender top) tube.
• Volume Required: Minimum 2 mL.
• Storage: Specimens should be stored at 2-8°C and processed
within 24 hours of collection.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens collected in tubes other than EDTA.
• Clotted or hemolyzed samples.
• Samples not processed within 24 hours of collection.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Flow cytometer.
• EDTA collection tubes.
• Antibodies specific to BTK, conjugated with an appropriate
fluorochrome.
• Isotype control antibodies.
• Cell lysis buffer.
• Washing buffer (PBS with 1% BSA).
• Fixation buffer (1-2% paraformaldehyde in PBS).
• Centrifuge.
• Vortex mixer.
• Pipettes and pipette tips.
• Personal protective equipment (PPE).
1. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation:
1. After collection, gently invert the EDTA tube several times to
mix the blood.
2. Aliquot 100 μL of the whole blood into a labeled 12 x 75 mm
polystyrene tube.
B. Staining Protocol:
1. Add 5 μL of anti-BTK antibody conjugated with an appropriate
fluorochrome to the tube containing the blood sample.
2. In a separate tube, add 5 μL of the isotype control antibody to
another 100 μL of blood for negative control.
3. Vortex gently to mix and incubate in the dark for 30 minutes at
room temperature.
C. Red Blood Cell Lysis:
1. Add 2 mL of cell lysis buffer to each tube.
2. Incubate in the dark for 10 minutes at room temperature.
3. Centrifuge the tubes at 400 x g for 5 minutes and discard the
supernatant.
D. Washing Steps:
1. Resuspend the cell pellet in 2 mL of washing buffer (PBS with
1% BSA).
2. Centrifuge at 400 x g for 5 minutes and discard the
supernatant.
3. Repeat the washing step twice.
E. Fixation:
1. Resuspend the cell pellet in 500 μL of fixation buffer.
2. Vortex gently to mix.
3. Store the fixed cells in the dark at 2-8°C until analysis. Analyze
samples within 24 hours.
F. Flow Cytometry Analysis:
1. Turn on the flow cytometer and perform instrument calibration
and compensation using appropriate controls.
2. Run each sample and control tube on the flow cytometer.
3. Collect at least 10,000 events for each sample.
G. Data Analysis:
1. Analyze the data using flow cytometry software.
2. Gate on the lymphocyte population based on forward and side
scatter properties.
3. Measure and record the percentage of BTK-positive cells in the
gated lymphocyte population.
4. Compare the BTK expression levels with the isotype control.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include positive and negative controls with each batch of samples
analyzed.
• Perform regular maintenance and calibration of the flow cytometer
according to the manufacturer's guidelines.
• Document all controls and sample runs in the laboratory logbook.
• Review QC results to ensure the integrity of the assay and
troubleshoot any deviations immediately.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Report the percentage of BTK-positive cells in the lymphocyte
population.
• Record any observations or deviations in the laboratory
information system (LIS).
• Include the date, time, and initials of the personnel performing the
analysis.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• The reference interval for BTK expression in lymphocytes will be
established based on laboratory validation and documented in the
laboratory’s reference manual.
1. LIMITATIONS
• Assay performance can be affected by the quality of the blood
sample, reagent performance, and flow cytometer settings.
• Deviations from the protocol can impact the accuracy of results.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's instructions for the flow cytometer and reagents.
• Standard laboratory protocols for flow cytometry.
This protocol ensures the consistency and reliability of BTK protein
expression analysis in blood samples using flow cytometry. It must be
followed closely to maintain the quality and accuracy of the results.
