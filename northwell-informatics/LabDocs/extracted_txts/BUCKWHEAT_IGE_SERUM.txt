Protocol for the Analytical Phase of Generating Results for
BUCKWHEAT, IGE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for the analysis of serum samples for
BUCKWHEAT Immunoglobulin E (IgE) using enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
2. SCOPE
This protocol applies to all serum samples received for
BUCKWHEAT IgE testing in the laboratory.
3. PRINCIPLE AND/OR PURPOSE
To detect and quantify the amount of BUCKWHEAT-specific IgE
in patient serum samples using the ELISA method. This test
aids in the diagnosis of BUCKWHEAT allergies.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
◦ Specimen Type: Serum
◦ Volume Required: Minimum 1 mL serum
◦ Collection Tube: Serum Separator Tube (SST)
◦ Specimen Stability: Store specimens at 2-8°C if testing will
be performed within 48 hours; otherwise, freeze at -20°C for
long-term storage.
5. REAGENTS, SUPPLIES, AND EQUIPMENT
◦ ELISA kit for BUCKWHEAT IgE
◦ Microplate reader
◦ Micropipettes and sterile pipette tips
◦ ELISA microplates
◦ Wash buffer
◦ Sample diluent
◦ Enzyme conjugate
◦ Substrate solution
◦ Stop solution
◦ Deionized or distilled water
◦ Timer
◦ Absorbent pads
◦ Laboratory bench protection
6. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Positive control: Serum sample with known BUCKWHEAT
IgE concentration
◦ Negative control: Serum sample without BUCKWHEAT IgE
◦ Each new kit lot and each test run must include controls to
ensure reliability and accuracy of the results.
7. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Allow all reagents, controls, and patient samples to reach
room temperature (18-25°C) before use.
2. Mix reagents gently but thoroughly.
Assay Procedure:
1. Sample Dilution: Prepare 1:10 dilution of serum samples
using sample diluent.
2. Plate Setup:
▪ Add 100 μL of standards, controls, and diluted serum
samples to the appropriate wells of the microplate.
3. Incubation: Cover the microplate and incubate at 37°C
for 1 hour.
4. Washing: Aspirate the contents of each well and wash
three times with wash buffer.
▪ Tap the plate on absorbent pads to remove any
remaining wash buffer after the final wash.
5. Enzyme Conjugate Addition: Add 100 μL of enzyme
conjugate to each well.
6. Incubation: Cover the microplate and incubate at 37°C
for 30 minutes.
7. Washing: Repeat the wash step as described above.
8. Substrate Addition: Add 100 μL of substrate solution to
each well.
9. Incubation: Incubate at room temperature (18-25°C) in
the dark for 15 minutes.
10. Stop Reaction: Add 100 μL of stop solution to each well.
11. Reading: Measure the absorbance of each well at 450
nm using a microplate reader.
8. CALCULATION OF RESULTS
◦ Construct a standard curve by plotting the mean
absorbance value for each standard against its
corresponding concentration.
◦ Use the standard curve to determine the IgE concentration
of the patient samples.
◦ Report results in kUA/L.
9. REPORTING OF RESULTS
◦ Results should be reviewed and verified by the technologist.
◦ Critical values and significant findings must be reported to
the requesting physician promptly.
◦ All results should be documented in the laboratory
information system (LIS) and followed by appropriate
interpretative comments as required.
10. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Reference intervals will be provided by the manufacturer of the
ELISA kit and should align with clinical guidelines and published
literature.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• This assay is specific for BUCKWHEAT IgE detection. Cross-
reactivity with other allergens should be considered.
• Hemolysis, lipemia, and microbial contamination of specimens
may affect the test results.
1. REFERENCES
• ELISA kit manufacturer’s instruction manual.
• Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines.
1. REVIEW AND REVISION HISTORY
• This protocol will be reviewed annually or as needed based on
new literature, method updates or as dictated by changes in
regulatory requirements.
