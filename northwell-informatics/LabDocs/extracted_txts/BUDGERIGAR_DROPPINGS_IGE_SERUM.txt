Standard Operating Procedure: BUDGERIGAR DROPPINGS,
IGE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for the analytical phase of testing
Budgerigar Droppings IgE in serum to ensure accurate and reliable
results for diagnostic purposes.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all clinical laboratory personnel who
perform the Budgerigar Droppings IgE testing on patient serum
samples.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of trained laboratory personnel to perform,
document, and validate the Budgerigar Droppings IgE test according
to this SOP. It is also the responsibility of supervisors to ensure
compliance with this procedure.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND HANDLING
Specimen Type: Serum Volume: A minimum of 1 mL of serum is
required. Collection: Blood should be collected in a red-top tube or
serum separator tube (SST). Processing: Allow blood to clot at room
temperature for 30 minutes to 1 hour, then centrifuge at 1500-2500
RPM for 10-15 minutes. Transfer serum to a labeled aliquot tube.
Storage: Store serum samples at 2-8°C if assayed within 7 days. For
long-term storage, freeze at -20°C or colder. Avoid repeated freeze-
thaw cycles.
5. EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes and tips
• ELISA plate reader or autoanalyzer compatible with IgE testing
• Refrigeration units (2-8°C, -20°C or colder)
• Budgerigar Droppings IgE ELISA kit or equivalent
• Calibrators and Controls (provided with the kit)
• Data management system/ Laboratory Information System (LIS)
6. QUALITY CONTROL
Run controls with each batch of patient samples. Controls should
include:
• A Negative Control
• A Low-Level Positive Control
• A High-Level Positive Control
Confirm that control results fall within established ranges before
proceeding with patient sample analysis. Document all quality control
results and take necessary corrective actions if controls fall outside
specified limits.
7. PROCEDURE
1. Preparation:
◦ Bring all reagents, calibrators, controls, and patient
specimens to room temperature.
◦ Prepare wash buffer and diluents as required by the
manufacturer's instructions.
2. Assay Procedure:
◦ Label the microtiter plate or autoanalyzer sample wells.
◦ Pipette appropriate volumes of calibrators, controls, and
serum samples into designated wells.
◦ Add required reagents to each well following the
manufacturer’s instructions (typically antigen-coated wells
followed by enzyme-labeled detection antibody).
◦ Incubate the plate at room temperature or at the specified
temperature for the required period.
◦ Wash the plate as per the provided protocol.
◦ Add the substrate solution and incubate again for the
prescribed time.
◦ Add stopping solution to terminate the reaction.
◦ Read the absorbance of each well using an ELISA plate
reader at the specified wavelength.
3. Calculations:
◦ Construct a standard curve by plotting the absorbance of
calibrators against their corresponding IgE concentrations.
◦ Determine the concentration of IgE (U/L) in patient samples
by interpolation from the standard curve.
◦ Each plate should have its own standard curve unless a
batch calibration is validated.
8. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
• IgE levels in the patient sample are determined from the standard
curve and recorded.
• Compare patient IgE levels against established reference ranges.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
• Document the results in the laboratory information system (LIS).
• Ensure all patient data is correctly inputted and reviewed before
final reporting.
• Validate and verify the accuracy and reliability of all results prior to
release to physicians.
10. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Normal reference ranges may vary; consult specific laboratory
guidelines and relevant literature for the appropriate reference
intervals for Budgerigar Droppings IgE values.
11. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Results should be interpreted within the context of the total clinical
picture.
• Potential interferences include heterophilic antibodies or high
levels of biotin, which may affect the assay outcome.

13. DOCUMENTATION
Maintain all records of the assay, including quality control logs,
maintenance records, and calibration data. Ensure documentation is
up-to-date and available for review.
By adhering to this SOP, laboratory personnel can ensure the reliable
and accurate analysis of Budgerigar Droppings IgE in serum
samples, thereby contributing to accurate clinical diagnostics for
patients.
