Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Title: Analytical Phase
Protocol for Generating Results for Budgerigar Feathers, IgE, Serum
Effective Date: [Insert Date] Version: 1.0 Approval: [Name/Title]
1. PURPOSE This SOP outlines the steps for the analytical phase of
generating results for Budgerigar Feathers, IgE, Serum to ensure
consistency, accuracy, and reliability in laboratory testing. The
procedure includes sample preparation, assay setup, quality control,
and result interpretation.
2. SCOPE This protocol is intended for all laboratory personnel
trained in performing Budgerigar Feathers, IgE, Serum assays using
an immunoassay analyzer.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Laboratory scientists are responsible for executing this procedure.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring that personnel are
trained and able to accurately follow the procedure.
4. DEFINITIONS
• IgE: Immunoglobulin E, an antibody involved in allergic reactions.
• Serum: The clear, yellowish fluid that remains after blood has
clotted, used for the test.
• ImmunoCAP: A common analyzer used for specific IgE testing.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Immunoassay analyzer (e.g., ImmunoCAP system)
• Calibrators and controls specific to IgE testing
• Budgerigar Feathers IgE-specific reagent kits
• Pipettes and tips
• Centrifuge
• Serum separator tubes (SST)
• Laboratory consumables (e.g., gloves, aliquot tubes)
• Refrigerator/freezer for reagent storage
6. PROCEDURE
6.1 Specimen Preparation
• Ensure the serum sample is properly labeled with at least two
identifiers (e.g., patient ID and date of birth).
• Allow refrigerated serum samples to reach room temperature.
• Centrifuge the serum separator tubes at 1500 x g for 10 minutes
to obtain clear serum if not already separated.
• Aliquot the appropriate volume of serum (as specified by the
reagent kit) for the assay, typically 20-50 µL.
6.2 Assay Setup
• Power on the immunoassay analyzer and perform any required
startup procedures as per the manufacturer’s instructions.
• Ensure that all reagents are at room temperature before use.
• Load the Budgerigar Feathers IgE-specific reagent kits into the
analyzer.
• Place calibrators, controls, and patient serum samples on the
sample tray as indicated by the analyzer protocol.
• Input or verify patient information and sample identification in the
analyzer's software.
6.3 Running the Assay
• Start the assay run as per the ImmunoCAP analyzer instructions.
• The analyzer will automatically dispense the reagents, perform
incubation steps, and measure the fluorescence or
chemiluminescence signal depending on the system.
• Monitor the assay run periodically for any errors or alerts from the
analyzer.
6.4 Quality Control
• Run both positive and negative control samples with each batch
of tests to ensure assay performance.
• Validate assay results against the control specifications provided
in the reagent kit instructions.
• Do not report patient results if control values are out of the
specified range. Investigate and correct any issues before re-
running patient samples.
6.5 Result Interpretation and Reporting
• Results are reported in kU/L (kilo units per liter) of IgE.
• Reference ranges for IgE should be obtained from the reagent kit
insert and laboratory-specific guidelines.
• Compare patient results to the reference range to determine if IgE
levels to Budgerigar Feathers are elevated.
• Document and verify results using the laboratory information
system (LIS).
7. PROCEDURAL NOTES
• Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) when
handling serum samples and reagents.
• Recalibrate the analyzer at the frequency recommended by the
manufacturer.
• Store all reagents as specified in the kit insert. Do not use
reagents past their expiration date.
• Dispose of biohazardous waste according to local regulations and
laboratory policies.
8. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If the assay fails or gives unexpected results, check the following:
◦ Proper specimen handling and identification.
◦ Correct loading and preparation of reagents.
◦ Analyzer maintenance and calibration status.
• Repeat the assay if necessary and consult the supervisor if issues
persist.
