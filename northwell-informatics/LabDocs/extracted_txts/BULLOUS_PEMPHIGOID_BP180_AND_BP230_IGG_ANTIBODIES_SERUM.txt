Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Bullous Pemphigoid, BP180 and BP230, IgG
Antibodies, Serum
1. PURPOSE
To accurately and reliably analyze serum samples for the presence of
BP180 and BP230 IgG antibodies, which are indicative of Bullous
Pemphigoid, using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
techniques.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for the preparation,
analysis, documentation, and validation of results for BP180 and
BP230 IgG antibodies. All personnel must ensure compliance with
this SOP to maintain the quality and reliability of test results.
1. SCOPE
This procedure applies to the analytical phase of testing serum
samples for BP180 and BP230 IgG antibodies, using an appropriate
ELISA kit, following the specimen collection and accessioning.
1. DEFINITION
BP180 and BP230 are proteins associated with the
hemidesmosomes of keratinocytes. IgG antibodies against these
antigens are found in patients with Bullous Pemphigoid, an
autoimmune blistering skin disease.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies
• ELISA reader capable of reading at 450 nm and 620 nm for
background correction.
• Incubator capable of maintaining 37°C.
• Adjustable micropipettes and sterile pipette tips.
• Distilled or deionized water.
• BP180 and BP230 ELISA kits, which include:
◦ Coated microplate wells with BP180 and BP230 antigens.
◦ Positive control.
◦ Negative control.
◦ Calibrators.
◦ Washing buffer.
◦ Conjugate solution.
◦ Substrate solution.
◦ Stop solution.
B. Preparation of Reagents
Follow the manufacturer's instructions provided with the ELISA kits
for preparation and storage of reagents. Ensure all reagents are
brought to room temperature before use.
C. Sample Preparation
1. Serum samples must be properly stored and thawed at room
temperature before analysis.
2. Ensure samples are clear and free of particulates before use.
Centrifuge if necessary.
D. Assay Procedure
1. Plate Setup:
◦ Assign wells for calibrators, controls, and patient samples
according to the ELISA kit instructions.
◦ Recommended format includes duplicate wells for each
calibrator, control, and patient sample.
2. Sample and Reagent Addition:
◦ Add the determined volume (usually 100µL as per kit
instructions) of each calibrator, control, and serum sample to
the corresponding wells.
◦ Incubate the plate at 37°C for the recommended duration
(e.g., 30-60 minutes).
3. Washing Step:
◦ Wash wells with washing buffer according to the kit
instructions (e.g., 3-5 washes).
◦ Ensure complete removal of wash buffer after final wash.
4. Detection:
◦ Add conjugate solution to each well and incubate at 37°C for
the recommended duration.
◦ Wash wells as described previously.
5. Substrate Addition:
◦ Add substrate solution to each well and incubate in the dark
at room temperature for the specified time.
◦ Add stop solution to each well to halt the reaction.
6. Measurement:
◦ Read the absorbance at 450 nm with a reference
wavelength of 620 nm using the ELISA reader.
E. Quality Control
1. Calibrators and controls must be run with each batch of patient
samples.
2. Re-run the assay if controls fall outside the designated range,
or if calibration falls outside acceptable limits.
F. Results Calculation and Validation
1. Calculate results according to the manufacturer's instructions
using the provided standard curve.
2. Results should be validated by a designated laboratory
technologist or supervisor.
3. Record results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
G. Reporting Results
1. Report results as per the reference intervals and reporting
guidelines provided by the kit manufacturer.
2. Alert clinical staff of any critical results following the laboratory’s
communication protocol.
3. DOCUMENTATION
Record all steps, results, and any deviations from the procedure in
the laboratory logbook and/or LIS. Maintain all logs, including
temperature monitoring, reagent preparation, and QC results, as per
laboratory policy.
