Bupivacaine (Marcaine) Analytical Phase Protocol
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedures for the accurate and reliable analysis of
Bupivacaine (Marcaine) in human specimens using appropriate
analytical techniques in a CLIA-certified laboratory.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing and
documenting all steps in the analytical process, including sample
preparation, analysis, and result verification. Supervisors are
responsible for ensuring that staff follow the procedures and for
addressing any issues that arise during the analysis.
2. DEFINITION
Bupivacaine, commonly known by the brand name Marcaine, is a
long-acting local anesthetic used for various types of anesthesia.
3. PROCEDURE
Specimen Requirements:
Preferred Specimen: Blood or plasma collected in EDTA or
heparinized tubes. Unacceptable Specimens: Hemolyzed, lipemic, or
coagulated samples.
Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies:
1. High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) system with
UV detector or LC-MS/MS system.
2. Bupivacaine standard reference material.
3. HPLC-grade solvents (e.g., acetonitrile, methanol).
4. Phosphate buffer solution (pH 7.4).
5. Disposable pipettes and tip.
6. Centrifuge.
7. Vials for HPLC analysis.
8. Analytical balance.
Sample Preparation:
1. Specimen Handling:
◦ Allow collected blood or plasma samples to reach room
temperature if stored cold.
◦ Centrifuge the sample at 1500-2000g for 10 minutes to
separate plasma.
◦ Carefully transfer the plasma to a clean container, avoiding
contamination with cells.
2. Sample Extraction:
◦ Prepare a phosphate buffer (pH 7.4).
◦ Vortex plasma samples thoroughly for 15-30 seconds.
◦ Mix 0.5 mL of plasma with 1.0 mL of phosphate buffer.
◦ Extract the mixture with 5 mL of acetonitrile; vortex for 1-2
minutes.
◦ Centrifuge the mixture at 3000g for 10 minutes.
◦ Transfer the supernatant to a clean vial for HPLC analysis.
Analytical Procedure:
1. HPLC/LC-MS/MS Setup:
◦ Set up the HPLC or LC-MS/MS system according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Column: C18, 5 µm, 150 x 4.6 mm.
◦ Mobile Phase: A gradient of acetonitrile and phosphate
buffer (pH 7.4).
2. Calibration and Standards:
◦ Prepare calibration standards of Bupivacaine in the range of
0.1 µg/mL to 10 µg/mL.
◦ Run a blank sample (solvent only) to ensure no carryover
between samples.
3. Injection and Analysis:
◦ Inject 20 µL of extracted sample into the HPLC or LC-MS/
MS for analysis.
◦ Monitor the elution of Bupivacaine at an appropriate
wavelength (e.g., 210 nm for HPLC-UV).
◦ Record retention times and peak areas for both standards
and samples.
4. Data Processing:
◦ Calculate the concentration of Bupivacaine in each sample
using the calibration curve.
◦ Ensure quality control samples (high, medium, and low
concentrations) fall within acceptable ranges.
◦ If quality control samples are out of range, recheck the
analysis before reporting patient results.
Quality Control:
1. Use commercially prepared quality control samples and
analyze them along with patient samples.
2. Perform daily calibrations using standard reference materials.
3. Ensure all instruments are calibrated per manufacturer's
guidelines and laboratory protocols.
Reporting Results:
1. Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS) for
verification.
2. Review and verify each result before reporting.
3. Document any deviations, corrective actions taken, and ensure
all critical values are appropriately flagged and communicated.
Reference Intervals:
• Therapeutic Range: 1-2 µg/mL (consult the latest clinical
guidelines for precise values).
Method Limitations:
• Potential interference from other local anesthetics or medications
should be noted, and if suspected, confirmed by an alternative
method.
• Stability of Bupivacaine in plasma samples should be confirmed
prior to analysis; samples should be analyzed as soon as
possible.
References:
• Relevant manufacturer’s operating manuals for HPLC or LC-MS/
MS systems.
• Current clinical guidelines and published literature on Bupivacaine
analysis.

for Bupivacaine (Marcaine), contributing to proper patient
management and therapeutic monitoring.
