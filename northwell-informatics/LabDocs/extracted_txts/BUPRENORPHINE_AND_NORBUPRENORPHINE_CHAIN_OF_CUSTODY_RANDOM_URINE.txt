Analytical Phase Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for
Buprenorphine and Norbuprenorphine, Chain of Custody,
Random, Urine Testing
1. PURPOSE:
To provide a standardized procedure for the analysis and reporting of
buprenorphine and norbuprenorphine in urine specimens, ensuring
chain of custody integrity in compliance with regulatory standards.
Responsibility:
Designated staff are responsible for performing the analysis as
outlined in this SOP and ensuring all documentation related to the
analysis, chain of custody, and quality control is complete and
accurate.
2. SCOPE:
This procedure applies to the analysis of urine specimens received in
the toxicology laboratory for determination of buprenorphine and
norbuprenorphine levels. It includes chain of custody documentation,
sample preparation, analysis, and reporting of results.
3. DEFINITION:
Buprenorphine and norbuprenorphine are opioid medications used to
treat opioid addiction. This analysis includes both analytes to confirm
the presence and amount of these substances in urine specimens.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES:
• Automated immunoassay analyzer (e.g., Thermo Fisher Indiko
Plus, or similar)
• LC-MS/MS (Liquid Chromatography coupled with tandem Mass
Spectrometry)
• Calibrated pipettes
• Positive and negative quality control materials (certified reference
standards)
• Specimen cups and transfer pipettes
• Conical centrifuge tubes (15 mL)
• Calibration standards for buprenorphine and norbuprenorphine
5. PROCEDURE:
A. Chain of Custody Documentation:
1. Verify that each specimen received has an accompanying chain
of custody (COC) form.
2. Confirm the chain of custody form is accurately filled out and
signed by each custodian who has handled the specimen.
3. Record the receipt of the specimen in the laboratory logbook,
noting any discrepancies immediately.
B. Specimen Preparation:
1. Mix the urine sample well before aliquotting to ensure
homogeneity.
2. Aliquot 1.0 mL of urine into conical centrifuge tubes.
3. Perform urine sample hydrolysis if required (depending on the
detection method employed).
4. If necessary, centrifuge the urine samples at 1500 rpm for 10
minutes to remove particulate matter.
5. Transfer the supernatant to a clean analytical vial for analysis.
C. Calibration and Quality Control:
1. Prepare calibration standards and quality control (QC) samples
as per the manufacturer's guidelines.
2. Ensure that three levels of QC materials (negative, low positive,
and high positive) are included in each run.
3. Run calibration standards to establish the calibration curve for
buprenorphine and norbuprenorphine.
D. Automated Immunoassay Analysis:
1. Load prepared samples, calibration standards, and QC
materials onto the automated immunoassay analyzer.
2. Run the instrument as per the operating instructions, ensuring
that appropriate controls are in place throughout the analysis.
3. Verify the results obtained from the immunoassay are within
acceptable control limits.
E. LC-MS/MS Analysis (if confirmation needed):
1. For confirmation or if initial immunoassay results are positive,
transfer the prepared sample to the LC-MS/MS system.
2. Perform sample analysis using LC-MS/MS, adhering to the
instrument's SOP for buprenorphine and norbuprenorphine
quantification.
3. Ensure each run includes appropriate reference standards and
quality controls to validate the analytical performance.
F. Interpretation and Reporting:
1. Review the results obtained from the analysis.
2. Report quantitative results for buprenorphine and
norbuprenorphine in µg/L (micrograms per liter), ensuring all
QC results are within control limits.
3. If chain of custody integrity is maintained, document and report
results in the patient's electronic medical record as per
laboratory policy.
4. If QC results are outside of acceptable limits, troubleshoot and
re-run the analysis or contact a supervisor for guidance.
G. Documentation:
1. Complete all required documentation, including chain of
custody forms, analytical run logs, instrument calibration
records, and QC logs.
2. Maintain records in accordance with regulatory and
accreditation requirements.
6. QUALITY CONTROL:
Perform QC on all new batches of reagents, calibration standards,
and at the start of each analytical run. Document and review QC
results promptly to ensure analytical accuracy and reliability.

8. HEALTH AND SAFETY:
Follow all laboratory safety protocols, including the use of personal
protective equipment (PPE), proper specimen handling, and waste
disposal procedures.

instruments, or regulations are introduced. Any changes to this SOP
will be documented and communicated to all relevant laboratory
personnel.
