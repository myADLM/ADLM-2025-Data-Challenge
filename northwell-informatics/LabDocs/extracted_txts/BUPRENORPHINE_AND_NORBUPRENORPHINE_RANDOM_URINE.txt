STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP) BUPRENORPHINE
AND NORBUPRENORPHINE, RANDOM, URINE
1. PURPOSE To provide standardized protocols for the detection
and quantification of buprenorphine and norbuprenorphine in
random urine samples through the analytical phase.
Responsibility:
Designated staff in the laboratory are responsible for processing and
analyzing urine samples for the presence of buprenorphine and
norbuprenorphine according to this procedure. It is the responsibility
of all laboratory staff to ensure the accuracy and reliability of test
results and to report any issues or abnormalities to the supervisor.
1. SCOPE This protocol applies to all analytical procedures
performed on random urine samples received for
buprenorphine and norbuprenorphine testing.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS: Preferred specimen:
◦ 30-50 mL of freshly voided urine, collected and sent to the
laboratory in a clean, leak-proof container.
Unacceptable specimens:
• Urine samples received more than 24 hours after collection
without refrigeration.
• Urine samples with insufficient volume for testing (less than 10
mL).
• Specimens with visual contamination (e.g., fecal material, blood
clots, precipitate).
• Specimens without proper labeling or accompanying
documentation.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES:
• High-Performance Liquid Chromatograph (HPLC) coupled with
Mass Spectrometer (MS).
• Calibrators and controls (e.g., 1 µg/mL for buprenorphine and
norbuprenorphine).
• High-purity solvents (e.g., methanol, acetonitrile).
• Autosampler vials and vial caps.
• Pipettes and pipette tips free from contamination.
1. PROCEDURE:
A) PRE-ANALYTICAL PHASE:
1. Record sample ID, date, and time of receipt in the laboratory
information system.
2. Perform sample inspection and verify proper labeling and
documentation.
3. Mix urine samples gently to ensure homogeneity.
4. Aliquot 10 mL of urine to clean polypropylene tubes.
B) SAMPLE PREPARATION:
1. Add 1 mL of urine sample to an autosampler vial.
2. Spike samples with internal standard solution equivalent to
calibrator concentration.
3. Subject the samples to a solid phase extraction (SPE) process
to remove matrix interferences.
4. Dry the eluate under nitrogen at 40°C.
5. Reconstitute the dried residue in 200 µL of mobile phase
solution.
C) INSTRUMENTAL SETUP:
1. Load the prepared samples, calibrators, and controls into the
HPLC autosampler.
2. Set HPLC-MS operating conditions as per the manufacturer's
recommendation for the detection of buprenorphine and
norbuprenorphine. - Column: C18, 2.1 x 50 mm, 3 µm. - Mobile
phase: Gradient mixture of water with 0.1% formic acid (A) and
acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid (B). - Flow rate: 0.5 mL/min.
3. Ensure appropriate ion source settings: - Electrospray
Ionization (ESI) mode - Positive ion detection.
4. Program the mass spectrometer to monitor specific ion
transitions for buprenorphine and norbuprenorphine.
5. Run system blank, followed by calibrators, controls, and urine
samples.
D) ANALYSIS:
1. Acquire data in full-scan mode, optimizing resolution for peak
separation.
2. Integrate the peaks for buprenorphine and norbuprenorphine.
3. Quantify analyte concentrations based on calibration curves
created from known standards.
4. QUALITY CONTROL:
1. Include at least one high and one low positive control for
every batch of samples.
2. Negative controls must be run to check for any carryover
or contamination.
3. Verify instrument performance periodically using regularly
scheduled calibration checks.
4. Record and review quality control results to ensure data
accuracy.
5. REPORTING RESULTS:
1. Compare the measured values against established cut-off
values to determine positivity.
2. Results exceeding the cut-off values must be
communicated with accompanying interpretative notes,
emphasizing clinical correlation.
3. Report results promptly according to site-specific
reporting guidelines.
6. LIMITATIONS: Refer to the HPLC-MS instrument manual for
potential method limitations specific to buprenorphine and
norbuprenorphine. Interferences, cross-reactivity, and sample
instability must be documented and reviewed.
