Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Buprenorphine Screen,
Random, Urine
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for performing and reporting results of the
Buprenorphine Screen in random urine samples.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for
conducting the urinalysis, interpreting results, performing quality
control measures, and ensuring the accurate documentation and
reporting of results.
2. SPECIMEN
Specimen Collection:
• Preferred/Acceptable Specimen:
◦ A minimum of 30 mL of random urine collected in a sterile
container.
• Unacceptable Specimen:
◦ Specimens in containers with no label (patient details).
◦ Specimens received more than 6 hours after collection without
proper refrigeration.
◦ Specimens that appear to have been tampered with or are
improperly sealed.
Specimen Storage:
• Urine specimens should be stored at 2-8°C if not tested within 2
hours of collection.
3. PROCEDURE
Equipment and Reagents:
• ABBOTT ARCHITECT immunoassay analyzer or equivalent.
• Buprenorphine reagents and calibrator sets (used as per
manufacturer's instructions).
Procedure:
1. Preparation: a. Ensure the analyzer calibration is current and
quality control checks are within the acceptable range. b. Let
stored samples equilibrate to room temperature before testing.
2. Analysis: a. Label the appropriate test tubes with the specimen
identifiers. b. Pour a portion of each urine sample into the
corresponding tube, ensuring no cross-contamination. c. Load
the test tubes onto the analyzer according to the analyzer's
operation guide. d. Select the Buprenorphine screening assay
on the analyzer. e. Process the samples according to the
routine analyzer operation.
3. Post-Analysis: a. Ensure all test results from the analyzer are
recorded accurately onto the Laboratory Information System
(LIS). b. If the result is positive, verify the result with a
confirmatory gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS)
test. c. If the confirmatory test is also positive, interpret and
document properly in the LIS.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
Materials:
• 2 levels of Buprenorphine Quality Control Materials.
Storage:
• QC materials should be refrigerated at 2-8°C and stabilized to
room temperature before use.
Procedure:
• Run QC samples alongside patient specimens each day and
whenever opening a new reagent kit.
• Evaluate QC results against the acceptable ranges provided in
the kit insert.
• Document and review QC results in the QC log. Take corrective
actions for any QC results outside the acceptable range and rerun
affected patient samples as necessary.
5. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
Reference Ranges:
• Negative: <5 ng/mL
• Positive: ≥5 ng/mL
Reporting:
• Negative Results: Report as "Buprenorphine not detected".
• Positive Results: Report the initial screen as “Preliminary
positive for Buprenorphine” pending confirmation. Only upon
confirmation should the final result be reported as “Positive for
Buprenorphine”.
6. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the manufacturer’s kit insert for potential analytical
limitations. Interferences in the sample, presence of other
medications or drugs, and specimen integrity issues could affect the
result accuracy.
