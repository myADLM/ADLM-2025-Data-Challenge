Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Buprenorphine Screen with
Reflex, Random, Urine
1. PURPOSE
This SOP describes the analytical procedures for conducting a
buprenorphine screen with reflex testing on random urine samples in
a CLIA-certified laboratory. The purpose of the screen is to detect the
presence of buprenorphine and its metabolites, which may be
followed by confirmatory testing if the initial screen yields a positive
result.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of trained laboratory personnel to perform the
buprenorphine screen with reflex testing according to the procedures
described in this document. Supervisors are responsible for ensuring
that staff adhere strictly to this SOP and for taking corrective actions
as necessary.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type: Random urine sample. Volume: Minimum volume
required is 10 mL. Collection and Handling: Ensure the specimen is
collected in a clean, dry container. Label the sample with the patient’s
information, collection date, and time. Refrigerate if testing is
delayed. Specimen Stability: Urine samples should be analyzed
within 48 hours if stored at 2-8°C. For longer storage, freeze at
-20°C.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Urine drug testing analyzer (e.g., immunoassay analyzer)
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes and pipette tips
Reagents:
• Buprenorphine screening reagent kit
• Confirmatory testing reagent kit (for reflex testing)
• Quality control materials (negative and positive controls)
Supplies:
• Urine collection containers
• Labeling materials
• Test tubes
1. PROCEDURE
A. Initial Screening:
1. Pre-analytical Preparation:
◦ Verify specimen identity and integrity.
◦ Bring specimens to room temperature before analysis.
◦ Mix specimens thoroughly by gentle inversion.
2. Instrument Preparation:
◦ Perform daily maintenance and calibration of the urine drug
testing analyzer as per manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Ensure that the buprenorphine screening reagent kit is
within the expiration date.
3. Sample Analysis:
◦ Load urine samples and appropriate quality control
materials onto the analyzer.
◦ Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for running the
buprenorphine screen.
◦ Document the process in the laboratory log, including the
date, time, and initials of the technician.
4. Interpretation of Results:
◦ Review analyzer printouts for each sample.
◦ Record results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
◦ If the screen result is negative for buprenorphine, report the
result as negative.
◦ If the screen result is positive or indeterminate, proceed to
reflex testing.
B. Reflex Testing (Confirmatory Analysis):
1. Sample Preparation:
◦ Post a positive screen result in LIS.
◦ Aliquot a portion of the positive urine sample for
confirmatory testing.
2. Confirmatory Analysis:
◦ Utilize a more specific method, such as Gas
Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) or Liquid
Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), for
confirmatory testing.
◦ Follow the specific SOP for confirmatory testing methods.
3. Interpretation of Confirmatory Results:
◦ Evaluate the confirmatory test results.
◦ Report positive findings only if the confirmatory test
validates the presence of buprenorphine and/or its
metabolites.
◦ Document results in LIS and release final report to the
authorized requesting personnel.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run quality control samples (negative and positive controls) with
each batch of urine samples.
• Ensure that all quality control results fall within the acceptable
ranges before reporting patient results.
• Investigate and document any quality control failures or deviations
from established control limits.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Enter all results into the LIS.
• Review and verify results before final release.
• Notify authorized personnel of reflex-tested confirmed positive
results and provide a detailed report.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Negative: No buprenorphine detected
• Positive: Buprenorphine detected and confirmed by the reflex
confirmatory test.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Ensure samples with high turbidity or particulate matter are
centrifuged before analysis.
• Verify any unexpected or questionable results with repeat analysis
or alternative methods.
