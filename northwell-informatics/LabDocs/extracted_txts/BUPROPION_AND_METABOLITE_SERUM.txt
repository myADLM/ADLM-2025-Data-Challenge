Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Title: Analytical Phase Protocol
for Bupropion and Metabolite, Serum
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this document is to outline the procedures for the
analytical phase of generating results for Bupropion and its
metabolite in serum specimens.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing the
analysis according to the outlined procedures. It is the responsibility
of all staff to report any deficiencies that may affect test results to a
supervisor.
1. DEFINITION
Bupropion: An antidepressant medication. Metabolites: The
compounds resulting from the metabolism of Bupropion, including
hydroxybupropion and others.
1. PROCEDURE
Sample Requirements:
• Preferred Specimen: Serum collected in a red-top tube (no gel).
• Acceptable Specimen: Serum collected in a SST tube, if a red-top
tube is not available.
• Unacceptable Specimen: Specimens collected in EDTA, citrate,
heparin, or any other anticoagulant.
Specimen Handling:
• Store the serum at 2-8°C if testing is not to be performed
immediately.
• Serum specimens are stable for up to 72 hours at 2-8°C or up to 1
month at -20°C.
• Ensure serum specimen has no visible hemolysis, lipemia, or
icterus.
• Prior to analysis, bring frozen samples to room temperature and
mix thoroughly.
Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies:
• High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) system with
UV detector.
• Standard solutions for Bupropion and its metabolites.
• Calibration standards and quality control materials.
• Mobile phase and buffer solutions, prepared per manufacturer’s
instruction.
• Sample vials and HPLC columns.
Procedure:
1. Calibration: a. Prepare calibration standards for Bupropion and
its metabolites. b. Perform calibration as per HPLC system
manufacturer's guidelines. c. Ensure calibration is within
acceptance criteria before proceeding with specimen analysis.
2. Quality Control: a. Prepare and analyze quality control samples
(low, medium, high concentrations) alongside patient
specimens. b. Verify that QC results are within acceptable limits
for the assay. c. Record and document the QC results for
traceability.
3. Sample Preparation: a. Centrifuge the serum sample at
2500-3000 RPM for 10 minutes. b. Transfer the clear serum to
a clean labeled sample vial. c. Prepare the sample extraction or
dilution as required by assay protocol.
4. HPLC Analysis: a. Load prepared serum samples, calibration
standards, and QC samples onto the HPLC system. b. Set
appropriate parameters (flow rate, column temperature,
detection wavelength) according to the manufacturer's
instructions. c. Run the HPLC analysis and record the
chromatograms.
5. Interpretation: a. Compare the chromatograms of patient
samples to the calibration standards. b. Determine the
concentration of Bupropion and its metabolites in patient
samples based on calibration curve data. c. Ensure all patient
results are within the validated range of the assay.
6. Reporting Results: a. Transmit results automatically to the
Laboratory Information System (LIS) for review. b. Verify results
and check for any flagged values or inconsistencies. c. Approve
the results for reporting.
7. Critical Results: a. Critical values should be communicated
immediately to the healthcare provider as per laboratory policy.
b. Document the communication of critical results in the LIS.
Method Limitations: Refer to manufacturer’s product insert for any
limitation on the detection range, interferences, or conditions affecting
the assay.
Safety Precautions: Follow all biosafety and chemical safety
procedures outlined by the laboratory, including the use of personal
protective equipment (PPE).
