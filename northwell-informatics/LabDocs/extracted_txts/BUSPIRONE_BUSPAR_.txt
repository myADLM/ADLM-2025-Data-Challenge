Standard Operating Procedure: Analytical Phase for the
Determination of Buspirone (BuSpar) Levels
1. PURPOSE
This procedure outlines the steps required to determine the
concentration of buspirone in patients' plasma or serum samples
using High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). This is
necessary to ensure accurate dosing and therapeutic monitoring of
patients prescribed buspirone.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of trained laboratory personnel to carry out this
procedure while ensuring adherence to the guidelines and
considered measures for instrument calibration, accuracy, and
documentation.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND ACCEPTABILITY
Specimen Type:
• Preferred: Plasma or serum collected in a lithium heparin or
serum separator tube (SST).
Handling:
• Specimens must be processed (e.g., centrifuged to separate
plasma/serum) and analyzed within 48 hours.
• If not analyzed within 2 hours of processing, specimens should be
stored at 2-8°C and must be analyzed within 48 hours. For longer
storage, specimens should be frozen at -20°C or colder.
• Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Hemolyzed samples
• Samples that have not been processed within 2 hours of
collection and stored appropriately
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• HPLC system
• Centrifuge
• Micropipettes and tips
• Vortex mixer
Reagents and Supplies:
• Buspirone Reference Standard
• Mobile Phase (typically a mixture of acetonitrile and water with pH
adjustment)
• HPLC grade solvents
• Sample preparation tubes
• Filters
4. CALIBRATION AND QUALITY CONTROL
Calibration:
• Prepare at least five calibration standards spanning the expected
concentration range.
• Calibrate the HPLC system daily before sample analysis.
Quality Control:
• Run quality control samples (low, medium, and high buspirone
concentrations) with each batch of patient samples.
• Acceptable control limits for quality control samples are within
±20% of their nominal values.
5. PROCEDURE
Sample Preparation:
1. Thaw frozen samples at room temperature, if applicable.
2. Vortex each sample for 5 seconds.
3. Centrifuge at 3,000 x g for 10 minutes to ensure plasma/serum
separation from cellular components.
4. Transfer the clear supernatant to a labeled clean tube.
HPLC Analysis:
1. Prepare the HPLC system by flushing and equilibrating with the
mobile phase.
2. Inject the calibration standards to establish a calibration curve.
3. Inject the prepared patient samples and quality control samples
into the HPLC system.
4. Record the chromatograms and ensure the retention time and
peak shape are consistent.
Data Analysis:
1. Calculate the concentration of buspirone in the patient samples
by comparing the peak areas of the samples to the calibration
curve.
2. Verify that all patient results fall within the linear range of the
standards.
3. Review and confirm that quality control samples are within
acceptable limits before releasing patient results.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Ensure results are reviewed and verified by a qualified
technologist.
• Highlight any results that fall outside the therapeutic range and
notify the requesting physician immediately.
7. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Ensure accurate specimen handling, as improper storage and
delays in processing can affect buspirone levels.
• Hemolysis or lipemia in samples may interfere with the HPLC
analysis.
8. REFERENCES
• Relevant guidelines and protocols as stipulated by CLIA and
manufacturer's instruction manuals for the HPLC system.
• Clinical pharmacokinetics resources specific to buspirone.
9. DOCUMENTATION
• Maintain all instrument calibration logs, quality control results, and
patient result records per laboratory protocols.
• Document all deviations from standard procedure and corrective
actions taken.
Ensure adherence to this SOP and provide ongoing training to
laboratory personnel to maintain proficiency in performing buspirone
analysis.
