1. PURPOSE
To provide a detailed protocol for the analytical phase of generating
results for Busulfan, Intravenous Dose, Area Under the Curve (AUC),
Plasma. This procedure ensures accurate and reproducible
measurement of busulfan levels in plasma to calculate the AUC for
therapeutic drug monitoring and dose optimization.
Responsibility:
Designated lab personnel are responsible for performing the
analytical procedures as outlined. Supervisors are responsible for
overseeing the process and ensuring all steps are followed
accurately.
2. DEFINITION
Busulfan: A chemotherapeutic agent used for conditioning prior to
hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. AUC: The area under the
plasma drug concentration-time curve, a key metric in
pharmacokinetics to determine the drug exposure over time. Plasma:
The liquid component of blood in which busulfan levels are
measured.
3. PROCEDURE
A. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies:
• High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) system or
Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)
• Busulfan reference standards
• Quality control samples (low, medium, and high concentrations)
• Internal standard (suitable for busulfan quantification)
• Extraction solvents and reagents
• Calibrated analytical balance
• Centrifuge
• Plasma collection tubes (containing anticoagulants such as
EDTA)
• Micropipettes and tips
• Analytical column suitable for busulfan separation
• Mobile phase solvents (HPLC/LC-MS/MS grade)
• Vortex mixer
B. Preparation of Calibration Standards and Quality Control
Samples:
1. Calibration Standards:
◦ Prepare a series of busulfan calibration standards at known
concentrations by spiking drug-free plasma with busulfan
reference standards.
◦ Concentration range should cover the expected
concentration range of patient samples.
2. Quality Control Samples:
◦ Prepare low, medium, and high concentration quality control
samples in drug-free plasma.
◦ Concentrations should be within the range of the calibration
standards.
C. Sample Preparation:
1. Collect plasma samples in appropriate anticoagulant-containing
tubes.
2. Centrifuge samples at 1,500 x g for 10 minutes to separate
plasma.
3. Aliquot the supernatant plasma into labeled microcentrifuge
tubes and store at -20°C if analysis is not performed
immediately.
4. Thaw samples at room temperature before analysis.
D. Extraction of Busulfan:
1. Add a known volume of internal standard to each calibration
standard, quality control sample, and patient plasma sample.
2. Add extraction solvent, vortex mix, and centrifuge to separate
the organic and aqueous phases.
3. Evaporate the organic phase under nitrogen and reconstitute in
mobile phase for injection.
E. HPLC/LC-MS/MS Conditions:
1. HPLC:
◦ Mobile Phase: Use an appropriate gradient or isocratic
method for busulfan separation.
◦ Column: Select an analytical column with suitable
characteristics for busulfan retention and separation.
◦ Detection: Use UV absorbance or other suitable detection
method for busulfan.
2. LC-MS/MS:
◦ Mobile Phase: Use an appropriate gradient or isocratic
method for busulfan separation.
◦ Column: Select an analytical column with suitable
characteristics for busulfan retention and separation.
◦ Detection: Use mass spectrometry with electrospray
ionization in positive ion mode.
F. Analytical Run:
1. Calibration and Quality Control:
◦ Inject calibration standards and quality control samples at
the beginning of the run.
◦ Ensure that calibration curve parameters are within
acceptable limits.
◦ Inject quality control samples intermittently throughout the
run to monitor system performance.
2. Sample Analysis:
◦ Inject prepared plasma samples.
◦ Ensure that the retention time of busulfan in each sample
matches that of the standards.
G. Data Analysis:
1. Generate a calibration curve by plotting the peak area ratio
(busulfan/internal standard) versus concentration for the
calibration standards.
2. Calculate the concentration of busulfan in patient samples
using the calibration curve.
3. Calculate the AUC using the trapezoidal rule or appropriate
pharmacokinetic software.
H. Quality Control:
1. Evaluate the QC samples to ensure they are within the
acceptable range.
2. If QC samples are out of range, investigate and resolve the
issue before reporting patient results.
I. Reporting Results:
1. Document all results in the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
2. Report the busulfan concentrations and AUC values as per the
site-specific guidelines.
Note: Ensure that all procedures are performed in accordance with
CLIA regulations and relevant laboratory best practice guidelines.
