Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analysis of Butalbital in
Serum
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to provide detailed instructions for the
detection and quantification of Butalbital in serum. This SOP aims to
ensure that accurate and reliable results are obtained for clinical and
diagnostic purposes.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of all laboratory personnel to adhere to the
procedures outlined in this document to ensure the integrity and
quality of test results. Supervisors are responsible for ensuring all
staff are trained and proficient in performing this procedure.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen:
• Preferred: Serum collected in a plain red top tube.
• Unacceptable: Serum collected in tubes with gel separators or
anticoagulants.
Specimen Stability:
• Serum specimens are stable for up to 7 days at 2-8°C.
• For long-term storage, serum specimens should be frozen at
-20°C or colder and are stable for up to 30 days.
1. REAGENTS, SUPPLIES, AND EQUIPMENT
Reagents:
• Butalbital reference standard
• Internal standard (e.g., deuterated Butalbital)
• Mobile phase solvents (e.g., acetonitrile, water, formic acid)
• Calibration standards and quality control materials
Supplies:
• Pipettes and disposable tips
• Serological pipettes
• Centrifuge tubes
• Vials for HPLC or GC analysis
Equipment:
• Centrifuge
• High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) or Gas
Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) system
• Analytical balance
• Vortex mixer
• Water bath or heating block set at 37°C
1. CALIBRATION AND QUALITY CONTROL
Calibration:
• Prepare a series of Butalbital calibration standards in serum
matrix at concentrations ranging from low to high clinical relevant
levels (e.g., 10 ng/mL to 1000 ng/mL).
• Each standard should be processed and analyzed in the same
manner as the patient samples.
Quality Control:
• Use at least two levels of quality control materials (low and high)
with known concentrations of Butalbital.
• Quality control materials should be analyzed at the beginning and
end of each batch of patient samples, and after every 20 samples.
1. PROCEDURE
Sample Preparation:
1. Allow serum samples and quality control materials to thaw at
room temperature if frozen.
2. Vortex all serum samples, standards, and quality control
materials to ensure homogeneity.
3. Pipette 0.5 mL of serum into an appropriately labeled centrifuge
tube.
4. Add an internal standard solution to each tube.
5. Add 2 mL of an extraction solvent (e.g., extraction buffer or
organic solvent) to each tube. Vortex for 1 minute.
6. Centrifuge the tubes at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes to separate the
phases.
7. Transfer the supernatant to clean tubes and evaporate under a
stream of nitrogen at 37°C.
8. Reconstitute the dried extracts in a suitable volume of mobile
phase.
HPLC or GC-MS Analysis:
1. Set up the HPLC or GC-MS system according to the
manufacturer's instructions, including column installation and
mobile phase preparation.
2. Inject a blank sample (mobile phase) to check for system
cleanliness and baseline stability.
3. Inject calibration standards and construct a calibration curve by
plotting the peak area ratio of Butalbital to the internal standard
versus concentration.
4. Inject quality control materials and ensure they are within
acceptable limits before proceeding with patient samples.
5. Inject patient samples and record the peak areas.
6. Analyze data using appropriate software to quantify Butalbital
concentrations in patient samples based on the calibration
curve.
7. DATA REPORTING
Reporting Results:
• Review and verify all results.
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Report results according to site-specific guidelines.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Therapeutic range: 10-30 µg/mL
• Toxic range: > 30 µg/mL
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolysis, lipemia, and icterus may interfere with the assay.
• Cross-reactivity with structurally similar compounds should be
evaluated and documented.
1. QUALITY ASSURANCE
• Perform instrument maintenance and calibrations as per
manufacturer's guidelines.
• Participate in external quality assessment programs to ensure
assay accuracy and comparability.
