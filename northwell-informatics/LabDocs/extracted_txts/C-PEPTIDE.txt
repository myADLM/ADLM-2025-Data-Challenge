Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for C-Peptide Analysis
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this SOP is to provide a detailed
protocol for the analysis of C-Peptide in patient specimens. This
instruction outlines the steps for accurate and reliable analysis
to ensure high-quality patient care and diagnostic services.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory staff are responsible for
performing the C-Peptide analysis according to this SOP. It is the
responsibility of all staff to recognize and report any deviations from
this protocol to the laboratory supervisor.
1. DEFINITION C-Peptide is a peptide released during the
processing of proinsulin to insulin and can be used to evaluate
insulin production in patients.
2. PROCEDURE
3.1 Specimen Requirements:
• Specimen Type: Serum or plasma
• Collection Tubes: Red top (serum) or green top (lithium heparin,
plasma)
• Volume: Minimum of 1 mL of serum or plasma
• Collection: Ensure proper patient identification and collection
technique to avoid hemolysis.
3.2 Specimen Handling and Storage:
• Store specimens at 2-8°C and analyze within 48 hours.
• For longer storage, freeze at -20°C or colder. Thaw frozen
samples completely and mix before testing.
3.3 Equipment and Reagents:
• Immunoassay analyzer capable of quantitative C-Peptide
measurement (e.g., Roche Cobas, Siemens ADVIA Centaur)
• C-Peptide reagent kit (use as per the manufacturer's instructions)
• Calibrators and controls (Commercially available, prepared
according to manufacturer's instructions)
• Laboratory timer, pipettes, and associated consumables
3.4 Quality Control:
• Run quality control samples (low, medium, and high) at the
beginning of each run and after every 20 patient samples.
• All control results must be within the established range before
reporting patient results.
• Review all QC data regularly and take immediate corrective
actions if QC results fall outside the acceptable limits.
3.5 Calibration:
• Calibrate the instrument using the C-Peptide calibrators as per
the manufacturer's instructions.
• Calibration must be performed with each new reagent lot or as
indicated by the analyzer manufacturer or as required by
laboratory policy.
3.6 Analysis Procedure:
• Ensure all reagents are at room temperature and properly
prepared.
• Load reagents, calibrators, controls, and patient samples onto the
immunoassay analyzer.
• Enter patient and sample information into the Laboratory
Information System (LIS) or directly into the analyzer.
• Follow the manufacturer's instructions and instrument prompts to
carry out the assay.
• Ensure sample and reagent volumes are accurate to avoid
erroneous results.
3.7 Reporting Results:
• Results will automatically be transmitted to the LIS after analysis.
• Technologist must review all results for validity and consistency.
• Report results directly into the patient’s electronic medical record
(EMR) after review and confirmation.
3.8 Reference Intervals:
• Adults: 0.5 - 2.0 ng/mL (may vary depending on the kit or
population studied). Review the package insert for the
recommended reference interval.
• Pediatric intervals should be referred to the specific guidelines
provided by the kit or relevant literature.
3.9 Method Limitations:
• Lipemia, hemolysis, and icterus can interfere with the assay.
• Presence of antibodies directed against C-Peptide or insulin
analogs may cause inaccurate results.
• Cross-reactivity with other substances should be evaluated
according to the manufacturer's instructions.
1. Corrective Actions for Out-of-Range Controls:
◦ Check for and address potential sources of error (e.g.,
sample integrity, reagent condition).
◦ Re-calibrate the instrument and re-run controls.
◦ If controls continuously fail, do not report patient results and
notify the supervisor.
2. References:
◦ Manufacturer’s package insert and reagent manual for
detailed reagent and control preparation.
◦ Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI)
guidelines for immunoassay procedures.
◦ Relevant scientific literature and internal validation data.
3. Documentation:
◦ Maintain records of all assays performed including
calibrations, quality controls, and patient results.
◦ Document any deviations from the SOP and corrective
actions taken.
◦ Record all maintenance and troubleshooting activities
performed on analytical equipment.
By following this SOP, the laboratory ensures the consistent and
accurate reporting of C-Peptide results, thereby maintaining high
standards of diagnostic service and patient care.
