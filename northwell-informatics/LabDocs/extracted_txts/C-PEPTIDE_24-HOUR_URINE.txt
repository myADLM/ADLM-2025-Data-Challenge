SOP for C-Peptide Analysis in 24-Hour Urine
1. Purpose To provide a standardized procedure for the accurate
and precise measurement of C-Peptide levels in 24-hour urine
specimens.
2. Scope This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel
responsible for the analysis of C-Peptide in 24-hour urine within
the laboratory.
3. Specimen Requirements a. Collection:
• The collection container should be a clean, leak-proof container
with a preservative as recommended by the laboratory.
• The entire 24-hour urine output of the patient should be collected.
• The collection should start and end with an empty bladder. The
first voided urine in the morning should be discarded, the time
noted, and all subsequent urine should be collected up to and
including the first voided urine the next morning.
b. Transport and Storage:
• Specimens should be kept refrigerated during and after collection.
• Transport the specimen to the laboratory as soon as possible,
maintaining refrigeration.

and control materials specific to C-Peptide
2. Procedure a. Specimen Preparation:
• Measure and record the total volume of the 24-hour urine
collection.
• Mix the urine thoroughly to ensure a homogenous sample.
• Aliquot an appropriate volume of the mixed urine for analysis
(e.g., 5 mL).
b. Centrifugation:
• Centrifuge the aliquoted urine at 1500 g for 10 minutes to remove
any particulate matter.
• Carefully decant the supernatant into a clean and labeled test
tube.
c. Assay Setup:
• Follow the specific manufacturer’s instructions for the C-Peptide
assay kit being used.
• Include all necessary calibrators, controls, and patient samples in
each run.
• Pipette the urine samples, calibrators, and controls into
designated wells or tubes according to the assay protocol.
d. Incubation and Detection:
• Proceed with the assay as per the manufacturer’s instructions
(e.g., enzyme incubation times, washing steps, and detection
methods).
• Ensure that all incubation times and temperatures are accurately
maintained as specified.
1. Quality Control a. Perform daily quality control using at least
two levels of QC material (low and high) to ensure that the
assay is working correctly. b. Verify that the QC results fall
within the expected ranges before proceeding with patient
samples. c. Document all QC results in the appropriate logs.
2. Calculation and Interpretation of Results a. Use the assay
calibrator curve to determine the concentration of C-Peptide in
patient samples. b. Multiply the concentration from the assay by
the total volume of the 24-hour urine collection to obtain the
total excretion of C-Peptide over 24 hours. c. Report the results
in appropriate units (e.g., micrograms per 24 hours).
3. Reporting Results a. Results should be reviewed and verified
by the technologist before entry into the Laboratory Information
System (LIS). b. Report any critical or unusually high/low values
to the requesting physician promptly.
4. Reference Intervals
• Establish reference intervals specific to your laboratory or refer to
the assay kit’s recommended reference ranges for C-Peptide in
24-hour urine.
1. Method Limitations
• Hemolysis, lipemia, or other interfering substances may affect the
assay results.
• Variability in total urine volume collection or preservation may
impact accuracy.
1. References
• Manufacturer’s assay kit insert for specific C-Peptide assay
details.
• Current clinical guidelines and literature on C-Peptide analysis in
urine.
1. Review and Maintenance
• The standard operating procedure should be reviewed annually.
• Updates should be made as necessary to reflect changes in
recommendations, equipment, or methodologies.
This protocol ensures the accuracy, reliability, and consistency of C-
Peptide measurements in 24-hour urine collections.
