Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analysis of C-
Peptide in Serum
1. PURPOSE
This procedure describes the steps for the analysis of C-Peptide in
serum samples using an automated immunoassay analyzer. C-
Peptide measurement is used for assessing pancreatic beta-cell
function in diabetic patients.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel responsible for the
analysis and reporting of C-Peptide levels in serum samples.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
Laboratory technologists must follow this SOP accurately and
consistently to ensure reliable and valid C-Peptide test results.
Supervisors are responsible for ensuring that laboratory technologists
are properly trained and comply with this SOP.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Serum
• Preferred Collection Container: SST (Serum Separator Tube)
• Volume Required: Minimum 0.5 mL of serum
5. SPECIMEN HANDLING AND STORAGE
• Upon collection, allow the blood to clot for 30 minutes.
• Centrifuge the SST at 1500-2000 g for 10 minutes.
• Transfer the serum to a clean, labeled tube if not directly using
SST.
• Store serum samples at 2-8°C for up to 48 hours.
• For longer storage, freeze serum at -20°C or lower. Avoid
repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
6. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Automated immunoassay analyzer (e.g., Cobas e411, Abbott
Architect i2000)
• C-Peptide reagent kit specific to the analyzer
• Calibrators and controls specific to the reagent kit
7. PROCEDURE
1. Preparation
◦ Ensure the analyzer is calibrated and QC checks are within
acceptable limits.
◦ Prepare the reagents and load them onto the analyzer as
per the manufacturer's instructions.
◦ Verify that the system is free of errors and ready for use.
2. Sample Loading
◦ Load serum samples into the appropriate sample cups or
directly into the analyzer sample rack as specified by the
instrument's manual.
3. Calibration
◦ Perform calibration using the provided calibrators as per the
manufacturer's protocol.
◦ Record calibration data and ensure calibrators fall within the
acceptable range.
4. Quality Control
◦ Run quality control samples (low, medium, and high)
provided with the test kit.
◦ Document the QC results. Ensure they are within the
predefined range.
◦ If QC results fall outside the acceptable range, troubleshoot
the problem according to the analyzer's troubleshooting
manual before proceeding with patient samples.
5. Sample Analysis
◦ Select the C-Peptide test on the analyzer menu.
◦ Load the samples and start the analysis.
◦ The analyzer will automatically process the samples and
provide C-Peptide concentrations.
6. Result Verification
◦ Review the analyzer printout or screen for results.
◦ Verify that the QC results are valid and ensure there are no
flags or error codes associated with the patient results.
◦ If results are flagged or there are error codes, follow
troubleshooting procedures, and re-analyze the samples as
needed.
7. Reporting of Results
◦ Enter patient results into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS) for review and verification.
◦ Critical results should be communicated to the responsible
clinician as per the laboratory protocol.
8. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
• Reference intervals:
◦ Fasting: 0.78 - 1.89 ng/mL
◦ Non-fasting values should be interpreted within the clinical
context.
• Any values falling outside the reference interval should prompt
clinical correlation by the requesting physician.
9. QUALITY CONTROL AND MAINTENANCE
• Run daily, weekly, and monthly maintenance procedures as
specified by the manufacturer.
• Perform bi-annual calibration verification and analyzer checks.
• Document all maintenance activities and keep records for audit
purposes.
10. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolysis, lipemia, and severe icterus can interfere with C-
Peptide measurements.
• Ensure sample integrity is checked, and such samples are not
analyzed or results are reported with appropriate caveats.

All laboratory personnel must be familiar with and adhere to this SOP
to ensure the accuracy and reliability of C-Peptide results. Regular
review and updates will be performed by the laboratory supervisor to
maintain compliance with best practices and current standards.
