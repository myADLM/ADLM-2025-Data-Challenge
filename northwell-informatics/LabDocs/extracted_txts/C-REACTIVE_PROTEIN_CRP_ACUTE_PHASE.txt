Standard Operating Procedure: Analytical Phase for C-Reactive
Protein (CRP) Acute Phase Testing
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the analytical phase of
generating results for C-Reactive Protein (CRP) acute phase testing
in a CLIA-certified laboratory.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of laboratory technologists to perform CRP
testing according to the procedure outlined in this document and
ensure accurate and timely reporting of results. Supervisors are
responsible for ensuring compliance and addressing any issues that
arise during the testing process.
1. DEFINITION
C-Reactive Protein (CRP) is an acute-phase protein synthesized by
the liver in response to inflammation. Elevated levels of CRP indicate
the presence of inflammation, infection, or other acute conditions.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Preferred Specimen:
• Serum obtained by venipuncture using an SST (serum separator
tube)
• Minimum volume: 0.5 mL
Alternative Specimen:
• Plasma collected in a lithium heparin, EDTA or citrate tube
• Minimum volume: 0.5 mL
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Hemolyzed specimens
• Specimens collected in tubes with anticoagulants other than
lithium heparin, EDTA, or citrate
Specimen Stability:
• Room temperature: 8 hours
• Refrigerated at 2-8°C: 48 hours
• Frozen at -20°C or lower: 6 months
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• CRP Test Analyzer (e.g., Siemens ADVIA, Roche Cobas)
• CRP test reagents (specific to the analyzer being used)
• Calibrators and controls (low, medium, high)
• PPE (personal protective equipment: gloves, lab coat, etc.)
1. PROCEDURE
2. Pre-Analytical Phase:
◦ Verify the specimen integrity (check for hemolysis, proper
labeling, and volume).
◦ Prepare the specimen for analysis (centrifuge serum
separator tubes to obtain serum).
3. Analytical Phase: a. Prepare the analyzer:
◦ Ensure the CRP Test Analyzer is calibrated as per
manufacturer guidelines.
◦ Perform maintenance procedures according to the user
manual.
◦ Load CRP test reagents, calibrators, and quality control
materials.
b. Run quality controls:
◦ Analyze quality control samples at the beginning of each
shift.
◦ Ensure control results are within the acceptable range
specified by the manufacturer.
c. Prepare and load patient samples:
◦ Verify patient information with the specimen label.
◦ Load patient specimens onto the analyzer as per
manufacturer’s instructions.
d. Start analysis:
◦ Initiate the CRP testing run on the analyzer.
◦ Monitor the test progress and address any error codes or
issues indicated by the analyzer.
e. Review results:
◦ Vetted results from the analyzer are reviewed for any flags
or errors.
◦ Document valid results following site-specific reporting
guidelines.
4. Post-Analytical Phase:
◦ Store specimens according to stability guidelines if retesting
is required.
◦ Dispose of biohazard waste following laboratory protocols.
◦ Review and verify all results and ensure transmission to the
Laboratory Information System (LIS) for reporting.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
Quality control must be performed daily before running patient
samples:
• Internal quality control must be within the acceptable range before
proceeding.
• If QC falls out of range, recalibrate the analyzer and re-run
controls.
• Document all QC results and actions taken in response to QC
failures.
• Regular comparison checks to verify analyzer performance.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• CRP results must be reviewed and verified by the technologist.
• Results should be transmitted to the LIS automatically.
• Critical values must be communicated to the responsible
physician immediately following the critical values policy.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Normal CRP range: < 3 mg/L
• Reference intervals must be verified periodically as per laboratory
guidelines.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to the analyzer manufacturer’s instructions for specific
limitations regarding the CRP test.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s User Manual for CRP Test Analyzer
• Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines
• Peer-reviewed articles on CRP testing and methodology
1. DOCUMENTATION
Maintain all records of quality controls, calibrations, patient results,
and any corrective actions taken for audit purposes in compliance
with CLIA requirements.
This protocol ensures standardized and accurate generation of CRP
results to facilitate the timely diagnosis and management of acute
phase conditions.
