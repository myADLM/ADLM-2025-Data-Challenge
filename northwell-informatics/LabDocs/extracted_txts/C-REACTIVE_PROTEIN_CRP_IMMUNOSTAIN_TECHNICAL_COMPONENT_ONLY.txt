SOP: C-Reactive Protein (CRP) Immunostain, Technical
Component Only
1. PURPOSE
Ensure accurate and consistent preparation and analysis of C-
reactive protein (CRP) immunostains. This protocol outlines the
procedures for the technical component of CRP immunostaining,
from reagent preparation to slide staining and quality control.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
All designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing
and documenting the CRP immunostaining procedure as specified in
this SOP. The laboratory supervisor is responsible for ensuring
adherence to the procedure and for addressing any technical issues
that may arise during the process.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Type: Paraffin-embedded tissue sections
• Thickness: 3-5 microns
• Number of Sections: Minimum of 2 sections per test
4. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• Primary Antibody: Anti-CRP antibody, appropriately diluted as per
manufacturer’s instructions
• Secondary Antibody: Species-specific secondary antibody,
appropriately diluted
• Chromogen/Substrate: DAB (3,3'-diaminobenzidine) or other
suitable substrate
• Mounting Medium: Permanent mounting medium for coverslipping
slides
• Positive Control: Known CRP-positive tissue section
• Negative Control: Tissue section treated with an isotype control or
without primary antibody
• Buffer Solutions: Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)
• Blocking Solution: Normal serum/blocking reagent
• Detection System: Appropriately matched detection system for the
secondary antibody
5. EQUIPMENT
• Microtome
• Water Bath
• Incubator/Oven (37°C)
• Humidified Chamber
• Microscope
• pH Meter (if applicable for buffer preparation)
6. PROCEDURE
6.1. Slide Preparation
• Cut paraffin-embedded tissue sections at 3-5 microns using a
microtome.
• Float sections on a water bath at 40-45°C and place on positively
charged glass slides.
• Dry slides in an incubator at 60°C for at least 30 minutes or
overnight at room temperature.
6.2. Deparaffinization and Rehydration
• Deparaffinize sections by immersing slides in xylene (2 changes,
5 minutes each).
• Rehydrate sections through graded alcohol series (100%, 95%,
80%, 70%) for 3 minutes each.
• Rinse sections in distilled water for 5 minutes to remove any
traces of alcohol.
6.3. Antigen Retrieval (if required)
• Perform heat-induced epitope retrieval (HIER) in a buffer
appropriate for CRP antigen (e.g., citrate buffer pH 6.0 or EDTA
buffer pH 8.0).
• Heat slides in a microwave, pressure cooker, or water bath at
95-100°C for 20 minutes.
• Allow slides to cool for 20 minutes at room temperature and then
wash in PBS for 5 minutes.
6.4. Immunostaining
1. Blocking: Incubate slides with blocking solution for 10 minutes
at room temperature to block non-specific binding sites.
2. Primary Antibody: Incubate slides with the diluted anti-CRP
primary antibody, covering the tissue sections completely, and
incubate in a humidified chamber for 1 hour at room
temperature.
3. Washing: Wash slides in PBS (3 changes, 5 minutes each).
4. Secondary Antibody: Incubate slides with species-specific
secondary antibody, appropriately diluted, for 30 minutes at
room temperature in a humidified chamber.
5. Washing: Wash slides in PBS (3 changes, 5 minutes each).
6. Chromogen/Substrate: Apply DAB or another suitable
substrate to the slides and incubate until the desired staining
intensity develops (typically 5-10 minutes). Watch under a
microscope to confirm development.
7. Counterstaining: Counterstain slides with hematoxylin for 1-2
minutes.
8. Bluting: Dip slides in ammonia water or a suitable bluing
solution.
9. Dehydration: Dehydrate sections through graded alcohols
(70%, 80%, 95%, 100%) and then in xylene (2 changes, 3
minutes each).
10. Mounting: Mount the slides with a permanent mounting
medium and coverslip.
6.5. Quality Control
• Include a positive control (known CRP-positive tissue) and a
negative control (isotype control or no primary antibody) in each
run.
• Evaluate controls to ensure staining quality and specificity.
• Record all observations and any deviations in a quality control
log.
6.6. Interpretation and Reporting
• Deliver stained slides to the pathologist for interpretation.
• Pathologist reviews the slides and records the intensity and
localization of CRP staining in the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
• Ensure timely and accurate transcription of results.
7. MAINTENANCE
• Regularly clean and maintain equipment according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
• Verify the functionality of all equipment used in the
immunostaining procedure.
• Review and document maintenance logs regularly.
