Standard Operating Procedure for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for C-Reactive Protein (CRP), Serum
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized guideline for the analysis and reporting of
C-Reactive Protein (CRP) levels in serum samples using the
specified immunoassay method. This SOP ensures that CRP testing
is conducted in a consistent, precise, and accurate manner, following
all safety and quality control regulations and ensuring reliable and
reproducible test results.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory technologists and supervisors are
responsible for performing, documenting, and verifying CRP tests
as outlined in this SOP. The laboratory staff must ensure that all
equipment and reagents are adequately maintained and quality
control procedures are adhered to.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen Type:
• Serum
Collection:
• Collect blood specimen in a serum separator tube (SST). Allow
the blood to clot by leaving it undisturbed at room temperature for
30 minutes. Centrifuge the SST tube for 10 minutes at 1500xg to
separate the serum.
Storage:
• Serum must be analyzed within 8 hours if kept at room
temperature (20-25°C).
• If analysis is delayed beyond 8 hours, serum can be stored at
2-8°C for up to 72 hours.
• For longer storage, serum can be aliquoted and stored at -20°C or
lower. Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric specimens may affect test results
and should not be used.
• Specimens with visible contamination or improper storage/
handling.
Specimen Volume:
• A minimum of 1 mL of serum is required for CRP analysis.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• CRP test reagents and calibrators
• Quality control materials (two levels: normal and abnormal)
• Immunoassay analyzer (e.g., Roche Cobas, Siemens ADVIA)
• Pipettes and disposable tips
• Incubation device (if applicable)
• Centrifuge
• Serum separator tubes (SST)
• Calibrated thermometers for monitoring equipment temperatures
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
1. QUALITY CONTROL
Internal Quality Control:
• Run two levels of quality control (normal and abnormal) at the
beginning of each analytical run, after every 20 samples, and at
the end of the analytical run.
• Document and review QC results. Values must fall within the
established range provided by the manufacturer or laboratory. If
QC results are out of range, troubleshoot, and resolve any issues
before proceeding with patient samples.
1. CALIBRATION
• Calibrate the immunoassay analyzer using CRP calibrators
according to the manufacturer's instructions.
• Perform calibration as per the schedule (e.g., weekly, with each
new lot of reagents, or after major maintenance/service).
• Document the calibration details, including date, calibrator lot
number, and results.
1. PROCEDURE
2. Preparation:
• Ensure all reagents, controls, and calibrators are brought to room
temperature before use.
• Verify that the immunoassay analyzer has been calibrated and is
functioning correctly.
1. Sample Handling:
• Ensure serum specimens have been properly stored and meet
the acceptance criteria outlined in Section 2.
• Aliquot serum into appropriate sample cups/vials for the analyzer.
1. Assay Procedure:
• Load the samples, controls, and calibrators onto the analyzer.
• Select the appropriate test parameters for CRP analysis.
• Start the assay run as per the manufacturer’s instructions for the
specific immunoassay analyzer being used.
• The analyzer will automatically mix, incubate, and measure the
CRP levels in each sample.
1. Result Reporting:
• Upon completion of the assay run, the analyzer will automatically
generate the CRP result.
• Review the results for any flagged values or discrepancies.
• Verify results for each sample. If results fall outside the reference
range or are flagged, re-run the sample or notify the supervisor for
further evaluation.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Refer to the manufacturer's instructions or lab-established
reference intervals for CRP. Typical reference intervals for CRP
are:
◦ Normal: <10 mg/L
Reference intervals may vary based on patient demographics and
the specific immunoassay method used.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Enter the verified CRP results into the laboratory information
system (LIS).
• Document any comments on specimen integrity or test anomalies
alongside the results in the LIS.
• Critical results should be reported immediately to the requesting
clinician as per lab policy.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to the specific immunoassay reagent kit insert for potential
interferences and limitations, such as the effect of hemolysis,
lipemia, or improper sample handling.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If calibration or quality control results are out of range:
◦ Check the reagents for expiration or contamination.
◦ Re-calibrate the analyzer as needed.
◦ Contact the technical support for the analyzer if the issue
persists.
