Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Analytical Phase of Generating Results for C-Reactive
Protein, High-Sensitivity (hs-CRP) Cardiac Risk
1. PURPOSE
To provide standardized procedures for accurate and reliable
measurement of high-sensitivity C-Reactive Protein (hs-CRP) levels
to assess cardiac risk in patients. This SOP ensures proper handling,
processing, analysis, and validation of hs-CRP specimens.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
All laboratory personnel performing hs-CRP assays are responsible
for following this SOP. Laboratory supervisors are responsible for
ensuring adherence to the protocol and addressing any issues that
arise during the analysis process.
3. DEFINITION
Hs-CRP is an inflammatory biomarker used to assess the risk of
cardiovascular diseases. High-sensitivity assays are designed to
detect low levels of CRP with greater accuracy.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Laboratory timer
• Calibrated high-sensitivity CRP analyzer
• Calibrated micropipettes and tips
• Calibrated centrifuge
• QC materials: commercial control samples
• hs-CRP reagent kits
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
• Record-keeping logs and forms
5. PROCEDURE
A. Pre-Analytical Preparation
1. Specimen Requirements:
◦ Acceptable specimens: Serum or plasma collected in red-
top or green-top tubes without anticoagulants.
◦ Preferred volume: 1 mL of serum or plasma.
◦ Store specimens at 2-8°C if analyzed within 72 hours; for
longer storage, specimens should be frozen at -20°C or
colder.
2. Specimen Handling and Processing:
◦ Centrifuge blood samples at 1500 x g for 10 minutes within
2 hours of collection to separate serum/plasma.
◦ Inspect the specimen for hemolysis. If hemolysis is present,
request a new sample.
◦ Aliquot the serum/plasma into labeled, contaminant-free
sample containers.
B. Analytical Procedure
1. Calibrator and Control Preparation:
◦ Follow the manufacturer's instructions to prepare calibrators
and QC materials.
◦ Ensure calibrators and controls are within their expiration
date and stored appropriately.
2. Instrument Calibration:
◦ Perform a system calibration using the provided calibrators
before running patient samples.
◦ Document all calibration details in the Calibration Log.
3. Assay Procedure:
◦ Set the analyzer to the hs-CRP mode and select the
appropriate assay protocol.
◦ Load the calibrators, controls, and patient specimens onto
the analyzer, ensuring proper identification and placement.
◦ Pipette and dispense the required volume of reagents,
controls, and samples as per the manufacturer's
instructions.
◦ Initiate the assay run on the analyzer.
◦ Allow the instrumental analysis to complete and review the
preliminary results for QC acceptability.
4. Quality Control:
◦ Run at least two levels of QC materials (high and low) with
each batch of patient samples.
◦ Verify QC results are within the acceptable range. If QC
fails, identify and correct the issue before proceeding with
patient sample analysis.
◦ Document QC results in the QC Log.
C. Post-Analytical Procedure
1. Result Validation and Confirmation:
◦ Review and verify the accuracy and precision of the results
produced.
◦ Compare the QC and calibrator results against expected
values to ensure proper instrument performance.
◦ Any flagged or out-of-range results should be addressed
according to laboratory guidelines.
2. Result Reporting:
◦ Enter the validated results into the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
◦ Report hs-CRP results as mg/L with the appropriate
reference intervals for cardiovascular risk assessment:
▪ Low risk: <1.0 mg/L
▪ Average risk: 1.0-3.0 mg/L
▪ High risk: >3.0 mg/L
◦ Include appropriate comments for any results associated
with pre-analytical, analytical, or post-analytical issues.
3. Specimen Retention and Disposal:
◦ Retain specimens for a minimum of 7 days post-analysis at
2-8°C.
◦ Dispose of specimens and biohazardous materials
according to safety and hazardous waste protocols.

requirements in laboratory testing.
7. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolysis, lipemia, and icterus may interfere with hs-CRP
measurements. Ensure proper sample preparation to avoid these
issues.
• Refer to the assay reagent insert for specific limitations
associated with the hs-CRP testing methodology used.
8. REVISION HISTORY
• Include log of SOP revisions with dates and detailed descriptions
of changes made.
End of SOP
Note: Ensure that appropriate laboratory accreditation and validation
protocols align with this SOP. Regularly review and update the
protocol to meet the evolving standards and recommendations.
