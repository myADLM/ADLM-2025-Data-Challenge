C-Reactive Protein, High Sensitivity (hs-CRP), Serum Analysis SOP
1. PURPOSE
This procedure outlines the standardized method for the analysis of
high sensitivity C-Reactive Protein (hs-CRP) in serum samples to
ensure consistent and accurate results.
Responsibility:
Designated staff members are responsible for performing the hs-CRP
analysis and documenting results as defined in this procedure. It is
the responsibility of all lab personnel to adhere to this SOP, report
any abnormalities, and ensure all processes are executed according
to the guidelines.
1. DEFINITION
High-Sensitivity C-Reactive Protein (hs-CRP) is a marker of
inflammation in serum, aiding in the evaluation of cardiovascular
disease risk.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
• Specimen Type: Serum
• Collection Container: SST (Serum Separator Tube) or plain red-
top tube
• Volume: Minimum 0.5 mL of serum
• Stability: Serum sample is stable for up to 48 hours when
refrigerated at 2-8°C. If longer storage is needed, serum must be
frozen at -20°C or colder, stable for up to 6 months.
1. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• Manufacturer-specific hs-CRP reagent kit
• Calibrators and controls specific to the reagent kit
• Automated immunoassay analyzer or nephelometer compatible
with the reagent kit
• Pipettes and tips
• Vortex mixer
• Standard laboratory consumables (e.g., gloves, tubes)
1. PROCEDURE
5.1 Initial Setup
• Verify that the instrument is calibrated and quality control (QC)
checks are within acceptable limits as per the manufacturer's
instructions.
• Inspect reagents, calibrators, and controls for expiration dates
and proper storage conditions.
5.2 Specimen Processing
• Centrifuge the blood collection tube at 1500-2000 x g for 10
minutes to obtain clear serum.
• Transfer the serum into a secondary labeled aliquot tube if
needed.
5.3 Calibration and Quality Control
• Perform calibration using the provided calibrators according to the
instrument and kit manufacturer’s protocol.
• Run quality control samples (low, medium, and high) before
analyzing patient specimens to ensure assay performance is
within acceptable ranges.
5.4 Sample Analysis
• Load serum samples onto the analyzer as specified by the
instrument’s user manual.
• Ensure each sample is identified correctly in the analyzer
software.
• Start the analysis run according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
5.5 Data Handling
• Review the generated data for each sample.
• Evaluate results against the QC data to confirm assay validity.
• Identify and flag any out-of-range results for retesting or further
analysis.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If a calibration or QC result falls outside of acceptable ranges,
repeat the calibration or QC check. If the issue persists, consult
the instrument’s troubleshooting guide.
• For any flagged or out-of-range patient results, check sample
integrity and rerun the specimen if necessary.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results are automatically transmitted to the Laboratory
Information System (LIS) for review.
• Technologist reviews, verifies, and releases results in the LIS.
Observe any institutional protocol for critical results reporting.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Reference interval for hs-CRP in adults:
◦ Low risk: < 1.0 mg/L
◦ Average risk: 1.0 – 3.0 mg/L
◦ High risk: > 3.0 mg/L
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Ensure no hemolysis, lipemia, or icterus in the serum sample as
these conditions may interfere with assay results.
• Refer to the reagent kit insert for detailed limitations related to
specific interferents and assay sensitivity.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Quality control is performed on every shift or batch of tests as per
the laboratory’s QC protocol.
• Maintain detailed records of all QC measures and corrective
actions as necessary.
