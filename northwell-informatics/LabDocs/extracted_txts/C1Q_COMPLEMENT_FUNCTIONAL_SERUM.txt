Protocol for the Analytical Phase of Generating Results for C1Q
Complement, Functional, Serum
1. Purpose
To provide accurate and precise determination of functional C1Q
complement levels in serum samples. This protocol ensures that
laboratory testing for C1Q complement functional assays is
standardized and reproducible, and that results generated are
reliable for clinical diagnosis and management.
1. Responsibility
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing the
assay according to this SOP. This includes ensuring the equipment is
properly calibrated, reagents are prepared correctly, and quality
control measures are followed. Any deviations or issues should be
reported to the laboratory supervisor immediately.
1. Specimen Requirements
• Preferred Specimen: Serum collected in a red-top tube (no
anticoagulant).
• Volume: Minimum 0.5 mL of serum.
• Stability:
◦ Serum should be separated from cells within 2 hours of
collection.
◦ Stored at 2-8°C for up to 48 hours.
◦ For longer storage, freeze at -20°C or colder.
◦ Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
1. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies
• Equipment:
◦ Calibrated microplate reader with wavelength settings as
specified by the assay kit manufacturer.
◦ Calibrated pipettes and multichannel pipettors.
◦ Refrigerated centrifuge.
◦ Water bath or incubator set to 37°C.
• Reagents:
◦ Functional C1Q Complement assay kit including necessary
antibodies, standards, and controls.
◦ Appropriate buffers and wash solutions as specified by the
assay kit.
• Supplies:
◦ Microtiter plates (supplied or recommended by assay kit).
◦ Plate sealers.
◦ Disposable pipette tips.
◦ Gloves and other PPE.
1. Procedure
A. Sample Preparation:
1. Thaw frozen samples at 2-8°C overnight or at room
temperature for a shorter period, ensuring the sample is mixed
thoroughly but gently.
2. Centrifuge the serum samples at 1500 x g for 10 minutes to
remove any particulates.
3. Aliquot the clarified serum into clean, labeled tubes.
B. Assay Procedure:
1. Reagent Preparation: Prepare all reagents, working
standards, and controls as per manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Microplate Setup:
◦ Add specified volumes of standards, controls, and samples
to designated wells.
◦ Ensure to run all samples, standards, and controls in
duplicate.
3. Incubation:
◦ Incubate the microplate for the time and at the temperature
recommended by the manufacturer.
◦ Follow with any washing and substrate addition steps as
indicated in the assay protocol.
4. Detection:
◦ After the final substrate addition, read the microplate at the
specified wavelength.
◦ Record the optical density (OD) values.
C. Calculation and Validation:
1. Standard Curve: Plot the standard curve using OD values from
the standards.
2. Sample Results:
◦ Calculate the concentration of C1Q in the samples using the
standard curve.
3. Quality Control:
◦ Verify that control results fall within the acceptable range.
◦ If controls are out of range, investigate and if necessary,
repeat the assay.
4. Quality Control
• Run both positive and negative controls with each assay to
ensure assay performance.
• Ensure all equipment is properly calibrated and maintained.
• Document all findings and any deviations in the assay log.
• Perform routine proficiency testing to ensure accuracy and
reliability.
1. Reporting Results
• Transfer manual results to the Laboratory Information System
(LIS) for review and validation.
• Ensure results above or below critical values are indicated in the
report for appropriate clinical follow-up.
• Include a comment with the reference range and interpretational
notes where relevant.
1. Reference Intervals
• Reference intervals may vary based on the assay kit used. Refer
to the assay kit insert for the appropriate reference ranges.
1. Method Limitations
• Hemolysis, lipemia, or icterus in serum samples may interfere
with the assay and result in inaccurate readings.
• Ensure samples meet the collection and storage requirements to
avoid degradation of the target analyte.

• Assay kit insert and manufacturer specifications.
• Laboratory Quality Assurance and Control Policies.
• Relevant clinical guidelines on complement testing.
By following this protocol closely, laboratory personnel can ensure
the accuracy and reliability of C1Q complement functional testing,
providing critical information for patient diagnosis and treatment.
