Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase for C1 Esterase Inhibitor Antigen, Serum
1. PURPOSE
To provide the procedure for the analytical phase of generating
results for C1 Esterase Inhibitor Antigen in serum, ensuring accurate,
reliable, and timely results for clinical assessments.
2. SCOPE
This SOP is applicable to all laboratory staff members involved in the
analysis of C1 Esterase Inhibitor Antigen levels in serum using
specific assays and instrumentation.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of laboratory technologists and supervisors to
perform and document the analysis of C1 Esterase Inhibitor Antigen,
serum as per the guidelines provided in this SOP. Supervisors are
responsible for ensuring that all staff are trained and proficient in this
procedure.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred Specimen: Serum, collected in a SST (serum separator
tube).
• Minimum Volume: 0.5 mL of serum.
• Stability: Serum is stable for up to 72 hours at 2-8°C. For long-
term storage, specimens should be frozen at -20°C or lower.
5. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• C1 Esterase Inhibitor Antigen Assay Kit (purchased from the
manufacturer)
• Calibrators and Controls (provided in the assay kit)
• Quality Control materials (Negative and Positive levels for C1
Esterase Inhibitor Antigen)
• Pipettes, Tips, and Tubes
• Laboratory Timer
• Automated Analyzer or Plate Reader (specific to the assay kit
used)
6. EQUIPMENT
• Automated Analyzer or Plate Reader (configured to C1 Esterase
Inhibitor Assay specifications)
• Refrigerators and Freezers (for reagent and specimen storage)
• Centrifuge (for serum separation)
7. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation
1. Ensure all reagents, calibrators, and control materials are within
their expiration dates.
2. Set up the Automated Analyzer or Plate Reader according to
the manufacturer's instructions.
3. Prepare the specimen and place in the appropriate tube.
4. Perform daily calibration and quality control checks on the
analyzer or plate reader.
B. Assay Procedure
1. Allow serum specimens and reagents to reach room
temperature (20-25°C) before testing.
2. Follow the specific steps provided in the C1 Esterase Inhibitor
Assay Kit insert, including instructions on sample dilution if
necessary.
3. Load serum specimens, calibrators, and controls onto the
analyzer or plate reader.
4. Ensure the run parameters are correctly set and initiate the
assay.
5. Document the assay parameters, including date, time, and
initials of the technologist conducting the test.
C. Result Interpretation
1. Review the output generated by the analyzer or plate reader.
2. Ensure that the calibrators and control results are within
acceptable ranges before interpreting patient results.
3. Document patient results in the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
D. Reporting Results
Results are transmitted automatically to the LIS. Technologists must
review and verify results before final reporting.
1. Normal Reference Ranges:
◦ C1 Esterase Inhibitor Antigen: 15 - 35 mg/dL (Note: ranges
may vary; refer to kit-specific insert)
2. Critical result reporting:
◦ Any results outside the reference ranges should be flagged
and reviewed for clinical significance.
◦ Notify the physician or responsible party promptly as per lab
policy for critical results.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Daily quality control includes running low, medium, and high
controls provided in the assay kit.
2. Monthly calibration using external quality control materials to
ensure accuracy and precision.
3. Document all quality control results, corrective actions (if any),
and reviewing trends for consistency.
9. SAFETY
1. Follow standard laboratory safety protocols including the use of
personal protective equipment (PPE).
2. Handle all specimens and reagents with care to prevent
contamination and exposure.
10. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the C1 Esterase Inhibitor Assay Kit insert for specific
limitations related to methodology, specimen integrity, and potential
interferences.
