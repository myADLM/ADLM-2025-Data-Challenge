SOP for C1 Esterase Inhibitor, Functional, Serum
1. PURPOSE
To outline the standardized procedure for the analysis of C1 esterase
inhibitor functional activity in serum specimens. This assay is
essential for assessing patients suspected of having hereditary or
acquired angioedema.
Responsibility:
• Laboratory personnel are responsible for performing this
procedure accurately and verifying all results.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring that all personnel
performing this assay are adequately trained and competent.
1. DEFINITION
The C1 esterase inhibitor (C1-INH) is a key regulator of the
complement system and other pathways involved in inflammation.
Functional activity measurement of C1-INH is critical for diagnosing
conditions such as hereditary angioedema (HAE).
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
• Preferred Specimen: Serum collected in a red-top tube.
• Volume: 1 mL of serum.
• Transport and Stability: Store specimens at 2-8°C if testing occurs
within 72 hours. For longer storage, freeze serum specimens at
-20°C or colder. Avoid multiple freeze-thaw cycles.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed specimens.
• Specimens with significant lipemia or icterus.
• Specimens collected in non-recommended tubes (e.g., EDTA,
citrate).
1. REAGENTS, EQUIPMENT, AND SUPPLIES
• Functional C1 Esterase Inhibitor reagent kit (validated and
unexpired).
• Calibrators and controls specific to the assay kit being used.
• Microplate reader or automated analyzer compatible with the
assay.
• Centrifuge.
• Incubator set to 37°C.
• Pipettes and pipette tips.
• Timer.
1. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation
• Assemble all necessary reagents, calibrators, and controls. Check
expiry dates and prepare according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
• Ensure that all equipment is calibrated and in proper working
condition.
• Maintain the assay components and specimens at the
recommended temperatures.
B) Assay Protocol
1. Allow all reagents and serum specimens to come to room
temperature prior to testing.
2. Thaw frozen specimens rapidly at 37°C and mix thoroughly.
3. Pipette the serum, calibrators, and controls into the designated
wells of the microplate according to the assay layout.
4. Add the C1 esterase inhibitor functional reagent to each well.
5. Incubate the microplate at 37°C for the manufacturer's
recommended time.
6. Wash the microplate wells to remove any unbound substances.
7. Add the substrate solution to each well, followed by an
appropriate incubation to allow color development.
8. Stop the reaction by adding the stop solution as per the assay
kit instructions.
9. Read the absorbance at the specified wavelength using a
microplate reader.
C) Calculation of Results
• Construct a calibration curve by plotting the absorbance of
calibrators against their respective concentrations.
• Determine the concentration of C1 esterase inhibitor functional
activity in the serum samples by interpolation from the calibration
curve.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run external quality control specimens with each batch of patient
samples to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the results.
• Use both low and high control samples.
• Results from the controls must fall within defined acceptable
ranges as provided by the reagent kit manufacturer.
• If any of the controls fall outside acceptable ranges,
troubleshooting and repeating the assay should be initiated.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• The results are reported as a percentage of normal functional
activity.
• Reference Interval: 70-130% (Note: Reference intervals may vary.
Verify with the guideline provided by the manufacturer or through
literature review specific to your patient population.)
• Critical Values: Functional C1 esterase inhibitor activity of less
than 40% should prompt immediate communication to the
requesting physician.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• High turbidity, hemolysis, lipemia, or icterus may interfere with the
accurate detection of C1 esterase inhibitor functional activity.
• The presence of autoantibodies or heterophilic antibodies in the
serum may potentially interfere with the assay.
• Review and follow specific limitations provided in the reagent
package insert.
