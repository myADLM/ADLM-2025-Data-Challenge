Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Generating Results for
C2 Complement, Functional, Serum
1. PURPOSE To provide a protocol for the analytical phase of
generating results for C2 Complement, Functional, Serum tests. This
procedure ensures accurate and timely results using standardized
methods and consistent quality control practices.
Responsibility:
• It is the responsibility of all laboratory personnel to ensure the
accuracy and quality of test results.
• Designated staff are responsible for performing the test,
documenting results, and maintaining equipment used in assay
analysis.
• Supervisors are responsible for reviewing results, addressing any
discrepancies, and ensuring adherence to SOPs.
2. DEFINITION C2 Complement is a serum protein that plays a
crucial role in the complement system for immune responses.
3. PROCEDURE
Specimen:
• Preferred Specimen: 1 mL serum collected in a red-top tube or
serum separator tube (SST).
• Ensure serum is separated from the clot and stored at 2-8°C if not
immediately analyzed.
• Specimen Stability: Serum specimens can be stored at 2-8°C for
up to 48 hours. For longer storage, freeze the serum at -20°C.
Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
• Unacceptable Specimens: Hemolyzed specimens, specimens in
anticoagulant tubes, specimens not properly stored or labeled.
Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies:
• C2 Complement functional assay kit
• Microplate reader suitable for endpoint assays
• Calibrated pipettes and tips
• Controls and standards as provided in the assay kit
• Plate washer or manual washing setup
• Miscellaneous lab supplies (gloves, lab coat, etc.)
Procedure Steps:
1. Pre-assay Preparation:
◦ Ensure all reagents and samples are at room temperature.
◦ Prepare standards, controls, and specimens according to
the kit instructions.
◦ Label all necessary wells on the microplate.
2. Sample and Reagent Addition:
◦ Add standards, controls, and serum samples to designated
wells.
◦ Add assay buffer and reagents in sequential order as
outlined by the kit instructions.
3. Incubation:
◦ Incubate the plate as specified in the assay protocol. Ensure
precise timing to maintain consistency.
◦ Protect the plate from light if indicated in the kit instructions.
4. Washing:
◦ Wash the plate using either a plate washer or manual
washing procedure. Perform washes as recommended to
remove unbound substances.
5. Detection:
◦ Add substrate solution to each well, followed by incubation
to allow color development.
6. Reading Results:
◦ Use a microplate reader to measure absorbance at the
specified wavelength.
◦ Record the raw data for analysis.
Quality Control:
• Run controls and standards in each assay to verify the accuracy
and reliability of the results.
• If controls provide out-of-range results, troubleshoot according to
the manufacturer’s instructions, repeat the assay, and notify the
supervisor if the issue persists.
Data Analysis:
• Plot standard curves for C2 Complement concentration versus
optical density (OD) readings.
• Calculate sample concentrations from the standard curve using
the software provided or manual calculations.
• If any sample falls outside the readable range, perform necessary
dilutions and reassay to obtain accurate results.
Reporting Results:
• Verify all data before reporting.
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
Review and confirm accuracy.
• Include reference intervals:
◦ Normal: 20-30 units/mL
• Report any critical results immediately to the supervising
physician.
References:
• Manufacturer's kit insert and instructions.
• Laboratory-specific documentation on sample handling, quality
control procedures, and result reporting.
By adhering to this SOP, we ensure the integrity and reliability of the
C2 Complement, Functional, Serum test results, contributing to
accurate diagnosis and patient care.
