Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase of Generating Results for C2
Complement, Functional, with Reflex, Serum
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this SOP is to outline the process and
procedures for the analysis of C2 Complement, Functional, with
Reflex, Serum, ensuring accurate, reliable, and timely results.
2. SCOPE This procedure applies to all personnel performing C2
Complement, Functional assays in the laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY It is the responsibility of the designated
laboratory personnel to:
• Ensure all analyses are performed in compliance with this SOP.
• Monitor and record all relevant data.
• Review and verify results before releasing them.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Type: Serum
• Volume: Minimum 1 mL
• Handling: Must be separated from cells within 2 hours of
collection. Store and transport at 2-8°C if analysis within 72 hours,
otherwise, store at -20°C or below.
• Unacceptable Specimens: Any serum that is hemolyzed,
lipemic, contaminated, or improperly labeled.
5. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• Functional C2 Complement Assay Kit
• Positive and negative controls
• Calibrators
• Pipettes and tips
• Microtiter plates
• Plate reader capable of measuring absorbance
6. EQUIPMENT
• Plate washer
• Microplate reader (set to the appropriate wavelength as specified
by the assay kit)
• Refrigerated centrifuge
• Incubator set to 37°C
• Freezer (-20°C or below)
7. PROCEDURE
7.1 Preparation
• Prepare all reagents, controls, and calibrators as per the
manufacturer’s instructions.
• Ensure all equipment is calibrated and functioning properly.
• Thaw frozen specimens and let them equilibrate to room
temperature. Mix thoroughly before use.
7.2 Assay Procedure
1. Setup:
◦ Label all wells on the microtiter plate according to the kit’s
instructions.
◦ Pipette appropriate volumes of calibrators, controls, and
patient samples into designated wells.
◦ Follow manufacturer’s instructions for the addition of linking
and detection reagents.
2. Incubation:
◦ Incubate the plate at 37°C for the time specified in the assay
kit insert, with careful attention to not disturb the plate.
3. Washing:
◦ Wash the plate using a plate washer according to the kit
instructions to remove unbound components.
4. Detection:
◦ Apply substrate solution to each well.
◦ Incubate the plate at room temperature for the time
specified in the kit, avoiding direct light.
5. Reading:
◦ Stop the reaction with the stop solution.
◦ Read the absorbance on a microplate reader at the
wavelength recommended by the assay kit.
7.3 Reflex Testing
• If the initial assay yields results outside the established reference
range, perform additional reflex testing as defined by laboratory
protocols.
• The reflex test typically involves further dilutions and re-analysis
to confirm initial results.
7.4 Quality Control (QC)
• Run positive and negative controls with each batch of patient
samples to ensure assay performance.
• If QC results are outside acceptable ranges, troubleshoot
according to the kit instructions and repeat the assay if necessary.
7.5 Calculations
• Calculate the values of the patient samples based on the
standard curve generated from the calibrators.
• Ensure all calculations are double-checked and accurate.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Review all results to ensure they meet quality standards.
• Interpret results according to the established reference ranges
provided by the assay kit.
• Report results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Verify and release results following laboratory protocol.
9. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Reference intervals are specific to the assay kit used and should
be included in the final report.
10. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to the assay kit instructions for specific method limitations
and interferences.
11. DOCUMENTATION AND RECORDS
• Maintain all records of the assay, including sample receipt logs,
worksheet logs, QC data, and instrument printouts.
• Ensure all records are retrievable for review and auditing
purposes.
12. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's Instructions for the Functional C2 Complement
Assay Kit.
• Laboratory Policies and Procedures Manual.
• CLIA regulations and guidelines for laboratory testing.
13. APPENDICES
• Include detailed schematic diagrams, troubleshooting charts, and
any additional relevant documents.
