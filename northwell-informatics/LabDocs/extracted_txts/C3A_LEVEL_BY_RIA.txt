Standard Operating Procedure Title: Analytical Phase: C3a Level
by Radioimmunoassay (RIA)
1. Purpose:
To outline the procedure for the quantitative determination of C3a
levels in serum or plasma samples using Radioimmunoassay (RIA).
Responsibility: It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory
personnel to perform the assay accurately and efficiently. Supervisors
are tasked with ensuring the adherence to SOP guidelines and
troubleshooting any issues that may arise.
1. Specimen Requirements:
• Specimen Type: Serum or plasma.
• Collection Tube: Serum separator tube (SST) or plasma
collected in EDTA.
• Preparation: Centrifuge samples at 1,500 g for 10 minutes at 4°C
to separate serum or plasma. If analysis is not to be carried out
immediately, aliquot samples and store frozen at -70°C until
analysis.
• Unacceptable Specimens: Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric
samples can interfere with the assay and should be avoided.
1. Reagents and Supplies:
• RIA Kit: Purchased from a reliable supplier with appropriate
reagents including anti-C3a antibodies, radioactive labeled C3a,
and buffer solutions.
• Gamma Counter:
◦ Must be calibrated and validated for use with RIA.
• Pipettes:
◦ Calibrated adjustable micropipettes.
• Vials/Tubes:
◦ Suitable for mixing and incubating samples and reagents.
• Laboratory Timer:
1. Quality Control:
• Control Material: Appropriate commercial control sera with
known C3a levels.
• Storage: Stored at 2-8°C. Stable unopened till expiry date.
1. Procedure:
A. Calibration:
• Follow manufacturer’s instructions to calibrate the gamma
counter. Ensure that all calibration standards and controls are
within the acceptable ranges before proceeding.
B. Preparation of Reagents:
• Thaw and bring all reagents to room temperature before use.
• Prepare working reagents and solutions as specified in the kit
insert.
C. Assay Steps:
1. Label Tubes: Label all sample, standard, and control tubes
appropriately.
2. Add Reagents:
◦ Pipette the appropriate volume of standards, controls, and
samples into the labeled tubes.
◦ Add a specified volume of radioactive labeled C3a and anti-
C3a antibody to each tube.
3. Mix and Incubate:
◦ Mix the contents thoroughly.
◦ Incubate the tubes at the recommended temperature and
time as outlined in the kit instructions, typically overnight at
4°C.
4. Separate Bound from Free Antigen:
◦ After incubation, separate the bound antigens from the free
fractions typically using precipitation reagents followed by
centrifugation.
◦ Carefully aspirate the supernatant, ensuring not to disturb
the precipitate.
5. Measure Radioactivity:
◦ Transfer precipitates to the gamma counter vials.
◦ Measure radioactivity in a gamma counter, ensuring
background counts and quality control samples are within
acceptable limits.
D. Calculation of Results:
• Generate a standard curve by plotting the cpm (counts per
minute) of the standards against the C3a concentration.
• Determine the C3a levels in samples by comparing the cpm of the
samples to the standard curve.
1. Reporting Results:
• Documentation: Enter all results, including quality control results,
into the laboratory information system (LIS).
• Review: Technologist must review and verify the assay results
before releasing.
• Reference Interval: Provide results as concentration of C3a (ng/
mL):
◦ Normal range: Typically specified by the kit manufacturer;
commonly < 200 ng/mL.
1. Troubleshooting:
• If quality control results are outside of specified ranges, revalidate
the gamma counter and repeat the assay.
• Adjust pipetting techniques if necessary to ensure precision and
accuracy.
• Ensure all reagents are properly prepared and not expired.
1. References:
• RIA Kit insert and user manual.
• Laboratory internal QC and validation records.
1. Additional Notes:
• Ensure all radioactive materials are handled and disposed of
according to federal and institutional regulations.
• Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE).
