Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for C3 Complement, Functional, Serum
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to ensure standardized, accurate,
and efficient analysis and reporting of C3 Complement, Functional,
Serum results in compliance with CLIA regulations.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of designated laboratory personnel to perform
the testing, analyze data, document results, and handle any
discrepancies or equipment malfunctions according to the
procedures outlined herein.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND HANDLING
Specimen Type:
• Preferred: Serum
• Unacceptable: Hemolyzed, icteric, or lipemic specimens
Specimen Collection and Preparation:
• Collect blood in a red-top serum separator tube (SST) or plain
red-top tube.
• Allow the blood to clot at room temperature for 30 minutes.
• Centrifuge the specimen to separate serum within 2 hours of
collection.
• Transfer the separated serum to a labeled aliquot tube if
necessary.
• Store serum at 2-8°C if analysis is to be performed within 48
hours. For longer storage, freeze serum at -20°C or lower.
Unacceptable Conditions:
• Specimens kept at room temperature for more than 2 hours post-
collection without separation.
• Repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Immunoturbidimeter (e.g., Siemens BN ProSpec)
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Centrifuge
• Refrigerator and freezer
• Serum aliquot tubes
Reagents:
• C3 Complement kit reagents (e.g., Siemens Dade Bering P/N
OQY013)
• Calibration material for C3 (e.g., Siemens N Protein Standard SL)
• Quality Control samples: Normal and Abnormal controls (e.g.,
Siemens N/T Protein Control)
Supplies:
• Red-top serum separator tubes (SST)
• Aliquot tubes
• Pipette tips
• Gloves
• Laboratory coats
1. PROCEDURE
Calibration:
• Allow all reagents, calibrators, and QC materials to reach room
temperature before use.
• Follow manufacturer's instructions to prepare and load calibrators
on the immunoturbidimeter.
• Calibrate the instrument according to the specific lot numbers of
reagents and calibrators.
Quality Control:
• Run Normal and Abnormal QC samples at the beginning of each
day, and with any new lot number of reagents or significant
instrument maintenance.
• Enter QC results into the QC log and ensure results are within the
acceptable range before analyzing patient samples.
Analyzing Patient Samples:
• Ensure the specimen serum is properly prepared and at the
correct temperature.
• Pipette the required volume of serum (as specified by the reagent
kit) into the appropriate sample container or directly onto the
immunoturbidimeter's sample carousel.
• Follow the instrument manufacturer's protocols to initiate the test
run.
• Record and save all data generated by the instrument, ensuring
accurate identification and association with the appropriate patient
sample.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
Data Review:
• Review the raw data and check for any flags or discrepancies.
• Evaluate QC data to ensure the run is valid.
• If QC results are out of range, do not report patient results and
troubleshoot as necessary. Document corrective actions and
repeat the test to ensure QC passes.
Verification and Reporting:
• Verify the result by comparing the generated result to the
reference interval (typically 0.9-1.8 g/L, but may vary by
laboratory).
• Enter verified results into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
• If results are within the valid range, report according to site-
specific guidelines.
• For critical results or discrepancies, follow the laboratory's critical
value reporting protocol including proper documentation and
notification of appropriate clinical personnel.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• C3 Complement, Functional, Serum: 0.9-1.8 g/L (Adjust according
to laboratory validation and specific reference ranges).
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Follow all routine QC procedures for daily, bi-weekly, and monthly
control checks.
• Document all QC results in the specific log or digital system used
by the laboratory.
• Address any QC failures immediately by implementing
documented troubleshooting steps.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Review the reagent kit's product insert for details on limitations
and interferences.
• Hemolysis, lipemia, and icterus may cause interferences and
false readings.
• Ensure proper calibration and equipment maintenance to
minimize errors.
1. RECORD KEEPING AND DOCUMENTATION
• Maintain logs of temperatures, calibration data, QC results,
patient results, and any deviations or corrective actions.
• Store all documentation securely as per laboratory policy and
regulatory requirements.
