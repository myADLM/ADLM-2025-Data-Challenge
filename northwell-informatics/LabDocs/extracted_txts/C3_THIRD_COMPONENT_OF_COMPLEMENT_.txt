Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for C3 (Third Component of Complement)
Assay
1. PURPOSE:
To establish a standardized procedure for the analysis of C3 (third
component of complement) in serum or plasma samples. This SOP
aims to ensure accuracy, precision, and consistency in the results
reported for C3 levels.
2. SCOPE:
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel performing C3 assays
using the specified instrument and kit.
3. RESPONSIBILITY:
It is the responsibility of designated laboratory personnel to adhere to
the procedures outlined in this SOP and ensure accurate
documentation and performance of the C3 assay. Supervisors are
responsible for overseeing the adherence to this SOP and
addressing any deviations or deficiencies.
4. DEFINITION:
C3 (Third Component of Complement) is a protein of the immune
system involved in the activation of the complement system. It is
measured in serum or plasma samples.
5. SPECIMEN: Preferred/acceptable:
• Serum: Using a plain red-top tube.
Unacceptable:
• Hemolyzed, highly lipemic, or icteric specimens.
• Specimens collected in anticoagulants other than EDTA (e.g.,
heparin, citrate).
6. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES:
• C3 Immunoassay Kit (specify brand and catalog number)
• Calibrators and controls (specified by the kit manufacturer)
• Micropipettes and tips
• Microcentrifuge
• Refrigerated centrifuge (if required for plasma samples)
• Incubator set at 37°C
• Automated analyzer capable of performing C3 assays (specify
model)
• Timer
• Appropriate waste disposal containers
7. PROCEDURE:
7.1 Preparation:
1. Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) such as
lab coat, gloves, and safety goggles.
2. Verify that all reagents and equipment needed are available
and have not expired.
3. Calibrators and controls should be brought to room temperature
before use.
7.2 Sample Handling:
1. Centrifuge whole blood samples at 3000 RPM for 10 minutes to
obtain serum or plasma.
2. Carefully aliquot the serum or plasma into a labeled microtube,
avoiding transfer of any cellular material.
3. Proceed with the assay within 2 hours if kept at room
temperature, or store the sample at 2-8°C for up to 48 hours, or
at -20°C for long-term storage.
7.3 Instrument and Reagent Preparation:
1. Turn on the automated analyzer and perform any required
maintenance or warm-up procedures.
2. Prepare the C3 assay reagents according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
3. Program the analyzer with the following assay parameters
(specific to the kit and instrument being used).
7.4 Assay Procedure:
1. Load the prepared calibrators, controls, and samples onto the
instrument as per the instrument's operational manual.
2. The instrument will automatically aspirate the sample and
reagents, mix, incubate, and measure the absorbance.
3. Once the assay run is complete, the instrument will calculate
the C3 concentration based on the calibration curve.
7.5 Reporting Results:
1. Review the results generated by the analyzer. Ensure all quality
control (QC) checks are within acceptable limits.
2. Validate the results as per laboratory policy.
3. Report the C3 results in mg/dL (or as specified by the
laboratory).
8. QUALITY CONTROL:
1. Run quality control (QC) samples at the beginning of each shift,
and with each new lot or shipment of reagents.
2. QC samples should include at least one normal and one
abnormal level.
3. Document all QC results meticulously and take corrective
action if QC results fall outside the predetermined limits.
9. REFERENCE INTERVALS: Reference intervals for C3 levels are
generally provided by the manufacturer of the assay kit and should
be verified by the laboratory. A typical reference range for C3 is
90-180 mg/dL.
10. METHOD LIMITATIONS: Refer to the manufacturer's product
insert for specific limitations of the C3 assay, including potential
interferences, the impact of hemolysis, lipemia, and icterus.
11. TROUBLESHOOTING: If unexpected results are encountered,
consider the following steps:
• Verify calibration and QC results.
• Ensure proper specimen handling and preparation.
• Check for any instrument error messages and resolve
accordingly.
• Consult the manufacturer’s troubleshooting guide for further
assistance.
12. DOCUMENTATION AND RECORD-KEEPING: All results, QC
data, instrument maintenance, and any deviations from the SOP
should be documented and retained as per laboratory policy to
ensure traceability.
13. REFERENCES:
• Manufacturer’s product insert for the C3 Immunoassay Kit.
• Laboratory Quality Assurance Manual.
• Relevant clinical laboratory standards (e.g., CLSI guidelines).
14. REVIEW AND REVISION: This SOP should be reviewed
annually or whenever substantial changes occur in the procedure,
reagents, or equipment. Revisions should be documented and
approved by the laboratory director or a designated representative.
