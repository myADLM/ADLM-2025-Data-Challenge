STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase of Generating Results for C4 Acylcarnitine,
Quantitative, Random, Urine
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for the quantitative analysis of C4
Acylcarnitine in random urine samples, ensuring consistent and
accurate results.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all personnel performing quantitative
analysis of C4 Acylcarnitine in random urine samples in our
laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the laboratory personnel conducting the
analysis to ensure adherence to this procedure. Supervisors are
responsible for the review and approval of generated data.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/Acceptable:
• Random urine sample (at least 10 mL) stored at 2-8°C if analysis
is delayed more than 2 hours post collection.
• Urine samples should arrive at the laboratory within 24 hours of
collection.
Unacceptable:
• Urine specimens containing visible particulates or contaminants.
• Urine samples arriving at the laboratory more than 24 hours post
collection.
• Specimens without proper labeling including patient details and
collection time.
5. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• LC-MS/MS system
• Centrifuge
• Acetonitrile
• Internal standard solution (d3-C4 Acylcarnitine)
• Ammonium acetate
• Water (HPLC grade)
• Reagent grade methanol
• 96-well plates or appropriate sample vials
• Pipettes (variable volume)
6. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation:
1. Centrifugation:
◦ Centrifuge the urine samples at 3000 rpm for 5 minutes to
remove any particulates.
◦ Transfer the clear supernatant to a clean, labeled container.
2. Internal Standard Addition:
◦ Add 50 µL of the internal standard solution (d3-C4
Acylcarnitine) to 200 µL of urine sample and mix thoroughly.
3. Protein Precipitation:
◦ Add 750 µL of acetonitrile to the mixture and vortex for 1
minute.
◦ Centrifuge the mixture at 10,000 rpm for 10 minutes.
◦ Transfer the clear supernatant to a clean vial for analysis.
4. Dilution:
◦ Dilute the supernatant with 250 µL of water.
B. Instrument Setup:
1. Set up and calibrate the LC-MS/MS system according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Mobile Phase A: 10 mM ammonium acetate in water.
◦ Mobile Phase B: Methanol.
◦ Column temperature: 40°C
◦ Injection volume: 10 µL
2. Sample Injection:
◦ Load prepared samples and calibration standards onto the
LC-MS/MS system.
◦ Begin the analysis sequence.
C. Analysis:
1. LC Conditions:
◦ Gradient elution program:
▪ Time 0-1 min: 90% A, 10% B
▪ Time 1-5 min: 10% A, 90% B
▪ Time 5-7 min: 90% A, 10% B
2. MS Detection:
◦ MRM mode for C4 Acylcarnitine and internal standard.
◦ Monitor transitions specific for C4 and d3-C4 Acylcarnitine.
3. Data Acquisition and Quantification:
◦ Analyze peaks using the appropriate quantification software.
◦ Calculate concentrations of C4 Acylcarnitine using
calibration curve prepared with known standards.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
A. QC Materials:
• Use commercially available QC materials with known
concentrations of C4 Acylcarnitine.
• QC samples should be processed and analyzed alongside patient
samples.
B. Control Frequency:
• Analyze at least one QC sample per batch of patient samples.
• Ensure QC results fall within the established acceptable range.
8. CALIBRATION AND MAINTENANCE
A. Calibration Curve:
• Prepare a calibration curve using serial dilutions of C4
Acylcarnitine standard solutions.
• Include a minimum of five calibration points for quantification.
B. Instrument Maintenance:
• Follow the manufacturer’s recommended maintenance schedule
for the LC-MS/MS system.
• Document all maintenance activities.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
Results are to be reviewed and verified by the laboratory technologist
before being entered into the LIS. Results will be reported in µmol/L.
10. INTERPRETATION AND REFERENCE RANGES
Reference values can vary based on age, sex, and clinical context.
Refer to the standardized reference ranges for C4 Acylcarnitine
levels in urine specific to the laboratory.
11. PROCEDURE LIMITATIONS
A. Interferences:
• Endogenous substances or medications can interfere with the
measurement of C4 Acylcarnitine.
• Adhere to proper sample preparation protocols to minimize
interference.
