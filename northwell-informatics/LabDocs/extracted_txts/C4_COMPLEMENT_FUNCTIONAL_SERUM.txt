Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for C4 Complement, Functional, Serum
1. PURPOSE
To provide a detailed and standardized procedure for the accurate
and reliable analysis of C4 complement, functional, serum. This SOP
ensures continuity, reproducibility, and accuracy of testing in our
laboratory.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of the laboratory technologist to ensure that the
C4 complement functional assay is performed accurately following
this protocol. The lab supervisor is responsible for the overall
adherence to the protocol and resolving any issues arising during the
testing process.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/Acceptable Specimen:
• Serum collected in a red-top tube or serum separator tube (SST).
• Collect at least 3 mL of whole blood or sufficient volume to yield at
least 1 mL of serum.
• After collection, allow blood to clot at room temperature and then
centrifuge for 10 minutes at 1000-1300 g to separate the serum.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed specimens, as lysed red blood cells can interfere with
C4 measurement.
• Specimens that have been stored at room temperature for more
than 48 hours.
• Specimens that do not have proper identification (patient name,
ID number, and date/time of collection).
Storage:
• Store separated serum in a tightly capped tube at 2-8°C and
analyze within 7 days if refrigerated.
• For longer storage, freeze the serum at -20°C or colder. Avoid
repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Analytical Instrument: Use an automated clinical chemistry
analyzer capable of running C4 complement, functional assays.
• Reagents: C4 complement assay kit.
• Control Material: Commercially available quality control (QC)
materials with known C4 complement concentrations (both normal
and abnormal ranges).
• Standard Laboratory Supplies: Centrifuge, pipettes, sterile
collection tubes, and appropriate PPE (lab coat, gloves, and eye
protection).
1. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation:
1. Ensure that all reagents and quality control materials are at
room temperature before beginning the test.
2. Verify the expiry dates and condition of all reagents and
controls.
3. Calibrate the analyzer as per the manufacturer’s instructions
using the specific calibrators provided.
B) Assay Procedure:
1. Load the prepared serum samples, controls, and standards
onto the analyzer.
2. Follow the analyzer’s specific instructions for loading reagents,
samples, and controls.
3. Select the C4 complement functional assay on the analytical
instrument.
4. Program the analyzer according to the manufacturer’s protocol,
including all necessary parameters such as incubation times
and reading wavelength.
C) Quality Control:
1. Run quality control samples at the start of each run and after
every 20 patient samples.
2. Verify that QC results are within acceptable limits before
reporting patient results.
3. Document all QC results in the appropriate log, including the
date, time, and initials of the technologist.
D) Interpretation and Reporting:
1. Once the assay is complete, review the results on the analyzer.
2. Inspect the results for any flagged values or errors and take
appropriate corrective action if necessary.
3. Enter valid results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
4. Ensure that critical values are promptly reported following
established protocols.
5. If results are outside the reference range, consider repeating
the test for confirmation.
Reference Intervals:
• Typical reference ranges for C4 complement functional activity
may vary; confirm with kit manufacturer’s instructions and
laboratory-established ranges.
E) Troubleshooting:
1. In the event of instrument errors or deviations in quality control,
refer to the instrument’s troubleshooting guide and the
manufacturer’s technical support.
2. Document any deviation, the corrective action taken, and
outcomes in the QC log or instrument maintenance log.
3. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolyzed samples, lipemia, and icterus can interfere with
results.
• Ensure that samples are free from contamination and properly
mixed to avoid inconsistent results.
• Patient preparation and sample collection technique can affect the
accuracy of the test.

1. REVIEW AND DOCUMENTATION
This SOP must be reviewed annually and updated as necessary to
reflect any changes in procedures, equipment, or reagent
specifications. Documentation of training and competency for all
laboratory personnel performing the test must be maintained.
