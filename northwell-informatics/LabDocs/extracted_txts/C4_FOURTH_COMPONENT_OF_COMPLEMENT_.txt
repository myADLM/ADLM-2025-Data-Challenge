1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to ensure the accurate and timely
measurement of C4 (Fourth Component of Complement) levels in
patient specimens, utilizing validated analytical methods within our
CLIA-certified laboratory.
Responsibilities:
• Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing
the C4 analysis according to the procedures outlined in this SOP.
• Supervisors are responsible for monitoring adherence to the
procedure, ensuring proper documentation, and implementing
corrective actions when necessary.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred Specimen:
• Serum: Collect blood in a red-top serum separator tube. Allow the
blood to clot for 30 minutes at room temperature and then
centrifuge at 1,500 x g for 10 minutes to separate the serum.
• Plasma: Collect blood in a green-top tube containing heparin.
Centrifuge at 1,500 x g for 10 minutes to separate the plasma.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens received that are hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric.
• Specimens collected in EDTA or other anticoagulants that
interfere with C4 measurement.
• Specimens arriving in the laboratory greater than 48 hours post-
collection without appropriate preservation.
• Specimens without proper labelling including collection date/time
or patient identification.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Automated Immunoassay Instrument
• Calibrators: C4 standard reference
• Control materials: Internal quality control samples (normal and
abnormal)
• Specific reagents for C4 measurement (provided by the
instrument manufacturer)
• Sample cups and pipettes
• Personal protective equipment (lab coat, gloves, safety goggles)
1. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation and Calibration:
• Validate the automated immunoassay instrument calibration using
C4 standard reference material.
• Run quality control samples before patient specimens to ensure
acceptable performance. Record the QC results.
B) Specimen Analysis:
1. Log patient specimens into the laboratory information system
(LIS).
2. Load samples following the instrument manufacturer’s
instructions, ensuring proper placement within the sample tray.
3. Start the analytical run.
4. Monitor the instrument for any error messages or alerts during
the run. Address issues according to the manufacturer's
guidelines.
5. Upon completion of the analysis, review the results for each
patient specimen against the quality control results.
6. Enter the patient results into the LIS. If any result is outside
acceptable parameters, repeat the analysis.
7. Document the results following site-specific reporting
guidelines.
8. RESULT REPORTING
Reference Intervals:
• Adult: 14-40 mg/dL
• Pediatric: Refer to specific age-based reference intervals.
Critical Values:
• No critical values established for C4.
Recording of Results:
• Enter the verified results into the LIS.
• Notify the ordering physician of any abnormal values per
laboratory protocol.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform quality control checks with each new reagent lot or
instrument calibration.
• Maintain records of all QC analyses including the lot number,
expiration date, and results.
• Perform bi-weekly comparisons of QC material between parallel
instruments if applicable.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolysis, lipemia, and icterus can interfere with accurate
measurement.
• Specimen handling and storage conditions impact results;
deviation from the recommended procedure may lead to
inaccurate readings.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's instructions for the automated immunoassay
instrument.
• Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines for
complement measurement.
• Peer-reviewed literature detailing complement analysis
methodology.
1. DOCUMENTATION
• Ensure all steps, calibrations, QC results, and specimen analyses
are recorded in appropriate logs.
• Attach printouts from the instrument to the patient’s permanent
record.
• Maintain records for the recommended retention period per
regulatory requirements.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If quality control samples fall outside acceptable limits, repeat the
analysis and investigate potential causes.
• If an instrument alerts reporting malfunction, follow the
manufacturer’s troubleshooting guide.
• Contact the supervisor for further assistance as needed.
This protocol ensures compliance with laboratory standards and
facilitates consistent and reliable reporting for C4 measurements.
