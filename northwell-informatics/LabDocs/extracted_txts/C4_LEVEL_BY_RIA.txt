Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for C4 Level by
Radioimmunoassay (RIA)
1. PURPOSE
To ensure the accurate determination of the Complement Component
C4 levels in human serum using Radioimmunoassay (RIA). This
protocol outlines procedures for the preparation, handling, and
analysis of specimens to provide consistent and reliable results.
1. DEFINITIONS
RIA: Radioimmunoassay, a technique that uses radiolabeled
molecules in a stepwise formation of immune complexes. C4:
Complement Component 4, a part of the complement system
involved in immunity and inflammation.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory technologists are responsible for performing
and documenting all steps of the protocol. It is the responsibility of all
staff to identify and report any issues that may affect the accuracy of
the test results.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred Specimen: Freshly collected serum stored at a temperature
of -20°C or colder. Unacceptable Specimen: Hemolyzed, improperly
labeled, or specimens containing excessive lipids.
1. MATERIALS, EQUIPMENT, AND REAGENTS
Materials:
• Serum samples
• Pipettes
• Microcentrifuge tubes
• Vortex mixer
Equipment:
• Gamma counter
• Refrigerator (-20°C)
• Centrifuge
Reagents:
• Radiolabeled C4 antibody
• Standard C4 solutions
• Assay buffer
• Wash buffer
• RIA plates
1. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Thaw serum samples at room temperature before analysis.
2. Prepare standard solutions in assay buffer to generate a
calibration curve.
Incubation: 3. Pipette the appropriate volume of standards, controls,
and patient samples into RIA plates. 4. Add the radiolabeled C4
antibody to each well. 5. Mix gently using a vortex mixer and incubate
as specified in the RIA kit instructions (generally overnight at 4°C).
Measurement: 6. Wash the wells thoroughly with wash buffer to
remove unbound components. 7. Measure the radioactivity using a
gamma counter according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Calculation: 8. Calculate the concentration of C4 in each sample
using the calibration curve generated from standard solutions. 9.
Document the results, noting any deviations or concerns.
Quality Control: 10. Run controls included with the RIA kit to ensure
the assay's validity. 11. Perform quality checks and maintenance on
the gamma counter, ensure it is functioning correctly.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
2. Review and verify results before entry into the Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
3. Follow site-specific reporting guidelines.
4. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Normal C4 levels: 10-40 mg/dL (consult updated references for site-
specific intervals).
1. LIMITATIONS
Any deviations from the defined sample handling, reagents, and
incubation times may lead to inaccurate results.
1. REFERENCES
Manufacturer’s instructions for the RIA kit used. Clinical references
on the accepted range and significance of C4 levels in diagnostic
procedures.
1. REVIEW AND REVISION
Review this protocol annually or when new equipment or techniques
are introduced.
1. ATTACHMENTS
Include detailed troubleshooting steps and flow charts for common
issues during RIA. Provide contact information for technical support
specific to the RIA kit used.
This protocol aims to standardize the procedure for C4 level
determination by RIA and ensure the accuracy and reliability of
results. All staff members must adhere to these procedures strictly.
