SOP for C5-DC ACYLCARNITINE, QUANTITATIVE, RANDOM,
URINE
1. PURPOSE
To establish a standardized procedure for the quantitative
determination of C5-DC acylcarnitine in random urine samples.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory personnel will perform urine C5-DC
acylcarnitine testing according to this SOP and document all relevant
information and results. All laboratory personnel are responsible for
identifying any discrepancies or issues with the testing process and
reporting to the supervisor.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen: Preferred/acceptable:
• Minimum 10 mL random urine collected in a sterile container.
Unacceptable:
• Specimens received more than 24 hours post-collection without
appropriate refrigeration.
• Specimens with no collection date/time indicated on the sample
container or requisition.
• Specimens showing evidence of contamination or degradation.
Specimen Stability:
• Store collected urine samples at 2-8°C immediately after
collection.
• Urine specimens are stable for 24 hours at 2-8°C.
• If transportation delay exceeds 24 hours, freeze the samples at
-20°C.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Required:
• LC-MS/MS system
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes
• Calibrators and internal standards
• Extraction solvents
• Mobile phase materials
• Controls: qualitative and quantitative for C5-DC acylcarnitine
Storage:
• Follow manufacturer’s guidelines for storage of reagents,
calibrators, and controls.
• Internal standards and extraction solvents should be stored
according to specified temperature conditions.
1. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Thaw frozen urine samples, if applicable, and bring to room
temperature.
2. Vortex each sample to ensure homogeneity.
3. Centrifuge all specimens at 1500-2000 x g for 10 minutes to
remove particulate matter.
4. Aliquot necessary volume of urine into labeled microtubes for
processing.
Extraction:
1. Add appropriate internal standard to each aliquot.
2. Perform solid-phase extraction or liquid-liquid extraction as
specified in the reagent SOP.
3. Dry extracted samples using nitrogen stream or vacuum
centrifuge per protocol.
Analysis:
1. Reconstitute dried extracts in mobile phase or suitable solvent
for LC-MS/MS analysis.
2. Inject the prepared sample into the LC-MS/MS system.
3. Run the sample analysis using established methods for C5-DC
acylcarnitine quantification.
Measurement:
1. Quantify C5-DC acylcarnitine concentration using the
calibration curve constructed from calibrators.
2. Ensure measurements are within the linear range specified.
Quality Control:
1. Perform analysis of quality controls with every batch of
samples.
2. Document and review QC results to confirm the accuracy and
precision of the analysis.
3. If QC results set outside acceptable limits, docuement, perform
troubleshooting steps, and rerun affected samples.
4. REPORTING RESULTS
• Record results of C5-DC acylcarnitine and include patient
identification, date, and time of analysis.
• Transfer results to the LIS and validate patient results, including
noting critical values.
• Follow specific guidelines for reporting critical values and
documenting any points of discrepancy.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• C5-DC acylcarnitine: refer to established reference intervals in
method validation documentation.
• Urine reference interval will be established based on population
studies.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the LC-MS/MS manufacturer’s guidelines and reagent SOP
for limitations and potential interferences in the accuracy of C5-DC
acylcarnitine measurement.

• Extract kit/manual used in the procedure
• Published clinical guidelines for detection of acylcarnitine in
random urine samples
1. DOCUMENTATION AND REVIEW
Record all procedural steps, deviations, results, and observations in
accordance with laboratory policy. Review this SOP regularly and
update as necessary to incorporate any methodological advances or
changes in clinical guidelines.
