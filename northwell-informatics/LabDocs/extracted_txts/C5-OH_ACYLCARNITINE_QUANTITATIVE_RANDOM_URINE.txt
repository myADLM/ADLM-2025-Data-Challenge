Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for C5-OH Acylcarnitine, Quantitative,
Random, Urine
1. PURPOSE
This procedure describes the steps for the quantification of C5-
OH Acylcarnitine in random urine samples. It outlines the
analytical process, including equipment and reagents, to ensure
precision, accuracy, and reproducibility of results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of designated laboratory personnel to
perform, document, and validate the analysis according to this
procedure. All personnel must adhere to this protocol to ensure
the quality and integrity of the results.
3. DEFINITION
C5-OH Acylcarnitine: A derivative of carnitine that is often
analyzed as part of metabolic disorder screenings or disease
monitoring. It is identified and quantified using liquid
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/acceptable:
◦ Random urine sample: Collect in a sterile container. A
minimum volume of 10 mL is preferred.
Unacceptable:
◦ Insufficient volume (<10 mL).
◦ Specimens that contain visible contaminants or are not
stored properly.
◦ Urine samples received more than 24 hours after collection
unless refrigerated.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
◦ LC-MS/MS system
◦ Reagents for derivatization and internal standards (as
specified in manufacturer protocols)
◦ Calibrators and quality control materials
◦ Disposable pipettes, vials, and consumables
◦ Centrifuge
◦ Refrigeration unit for sample storage
◦ Laboratory Information System (LIS) access for
documentation and result validation
6. PROCEDURE
a. Sample Preparation:
1. Upon arrival, inspect the sample for proper labeling and
volume.
2. Mix the urine sample by inversion.
3. Pipette an aliquot of the sample into a labeled tube.
4. If necessary, centrifuge the aliquot to remove particulate
matter (3000 RPM for 10 minutes).
b. Derivatization Process:
1. Add derivatization reagent as described in reagent
protocol to the aliquot.
2. Incubate the mixture for the specified time at the
recommended temperature.
c. Internal Standard Addition:
1. Add the internal standard solution to the derivatized
sample in a consistent and accurate volume.
2. Mix thoroughly by vortexing.
d. Sample Injection:
1. Prepare the LC-MS/MS system for analysis, ensuring
proper calibration with reference standards.
2. Inject the prepared sample into the LC-MS/MS system
according to instrument protocol.
e. Quantification:
1. Monitor and record the specific m/z transitions unique to
C5-OH acylcarnitine and the internal standard.
2. Quantify the peak area ratio of the analyte to internal
standard against the calibration curve to obtain the
concentration.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
Calibration and QC standards:
◦ Run calibrators and quality control materials at the
beginning, in the middle, and at the end of each batch.
◦ Acceptance criteria must be met for each QC level
according to lab-defined thresholds (±20% of target value).
8. REPORTING RESULTS
Data Validation:
◦ Ensure all QC samples are within acceptable ranges.
◦ Repeat any out-of-range samples.
◦ Validate and transfer results to the LIS.
Reference Intervals:
◦ Compare results to established reference intervals or age-
specific norms.
9. POLICY FOR REJECTION OF SAMPLES
◦ Document and reject unlabelled, damaged, or inadequate
volume samples.
◦ Recollection is necessary for rejected samples to ensure
compliance with the laboratory’s standards.

◦ Manufacturer’s protocols for LC-MS/MS instrumentation.
◦ Internal laboratory QC protocols and acceptance criteria.
◦ Relevant literature for reference intervals of C5-OH
Acylcarnitine.
NOTE: Ensure compliance with guidelines and regulations (e.g.,
CLIA, CAP) relevant to urine analysis and laboratory operations. All
staff must follow appropriate safety protocols and wear personal
protective equipment (PPE) as required.
