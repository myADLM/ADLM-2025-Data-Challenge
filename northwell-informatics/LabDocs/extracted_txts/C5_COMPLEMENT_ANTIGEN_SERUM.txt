Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analysis of C5
Complement, Antigen, Serum
1. PURPOSE To outline the procedure for the quantitative
determination of C5 complement component in human serum
samples utilizing enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
The aim is to ensure accurate, reliable, and consistent results
that are critical for patient diagnosis and treatment.
2. SCOPE This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel
trained in immunoassay techniques and is to be used for the
analysis of C5 complement antigen levels in serum samples.
3. RESPONSIBILITY It is the responsibility of the laboratory
personnel to follow this procedure as described to ensure the
integrity and accuracy of test results. Supervisors are
responsible for ensuring all personnel are adequately trained
and competent in performing this test.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
◦ Specimen Type: Human serum
◦ Collection: Blood should be collected by standard
venipuncture technique into a serum separator tube (red-top
or SST).
◦ Stability: Serum specimens are stable for up to 72 hours at
2-8°C. For longer storage, specimens should be frozen at
-20°C or lower.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
◦ ELISA kit specific for C5 complement antigen
◦ Microplate reader capable of measuring absorbance at 450
nm
◦ Multi-channel and single-channel pipettes and tips
◦ Vortex mixer
◦ Plate washer (optional)
◦ Deionized or distilled water
◦ Microcentrifuge tubes
◦ Serological pipettes
◦ Timer
6. PROCEDURE A. Sample Preparation
1. Thaw frozen serum samples to room temperature and mix
thoroughly by gentle inversion.
2. Centrifuge samples at 10,000 x g for 10 minutes to
remove any particulate matter.
3. Transfer the clear supernatant to a fresh tube for analysis.
B. Reagent Preparation
1. Prepare all reagents, working standards, and controls as
described in the ELISA kit insert. Allow all reagents to reach
room temperature before use.
2. Reconstitute the lyophilized standard according to the kit
instructions to obtain the highest concentration standard.
Prepare a series of standards by serial dilution.
C. Assay Procedure
1. Add 100 µL of standards, controls, and samples to assigned
wells in duplicate.
2. Incubate the plate at room temperature for 1 hour with gentle
agitation.
3. Aspirate and wash the wells 4 times with 300 µL of wash buffer
per well.
4. Add 100 µL of the enzyme-conjugate working solution to each
well. Incubate for 30 minutes at room temperature with gentle
agitation.
5. Aspirate and wash the wells 4 times with wash buffer.
6. Add 100 µL of substrate solution to each well. Incubate the
plate in the dark for 15 minutes at room temperature.
7. Add 100 µL of stop solution to each well to stop the reaction.
8. Measure the absorbance at 450 nm using a microplate reader
within 10 minutes of stopping the reaction.
D. Calculation of Results
1. Construct a standard curve by plotting the mean absorbance for
each standard concentration on the y-axis against the
corresponding concentration on the x-axis.
2. Determine the concentration of C5 complement antigen in
patient samples by interpolating the absorbance values from
the standard curve.
3. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Include controls provided with the kit in each run to ensure
assay accuracy and precision.
◦ Perform and document enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay tests according to the manufacturer's protocols.
◦ If control values fall outside the established ranges, the
assay run should be considered invalid, and troubleshooting
and repeat testing should be performed.
◦ Record lot numbers and expiration dates of all reagents,
calibrators, and controls used.
4. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ Results are reported in mg/dL or μg/mL as per the reference
range provided in the kit literature.
◦ Ensure results are reviewed and verified by a qualified lab
technologist before releasing.
5. REFERENCE INTERVALS
◦ Refer to the specific kit insert for the reference range for C5
complement antigen levels.
6. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Specimens with significant hemolysis, lipemia, or turbidity may
interfere with the assay.
• Refer to the ELISA kit insert for detailed method limitations and
specific conditions that may affect the analysis.
