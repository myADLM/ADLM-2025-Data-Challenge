Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for C5 Complement,
Functional, Serum
1. PURPOSE
To define the analytical procedures for determining the functional
activity of the Complement Component 5 (C5) in serum samples.
This protocol ensures consistent, accurate, and reliable
measurement of C5 functional activity to assist in diagnosing and
monitoring immune system disorders.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory personnel trained in
immunochemistry methods are responsible for performing and
documenting the analysis as per this SOP.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENT AND STABILITY
• Type of Specimen: Serum
• Preferred Specimen: 5 mL of whole blood collected in a red-top
tube (no anticoagulants).
• Handling: Allow the blood to clot at room temperature for 30-60
minutes. Centrifuge the sample at 1500 x g for 10 minutes at
room temperature to separate the serum.
• Storage:
◦ Short-term storage (≤48 hours): Store serum at 2-8°C.
◦ Long-term storage (>48 hours): Aliquot and store serum at
-20°C or below. Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
• Unacceptable Specimens:
◦ Hemolyzed or lipemic samples
◦ Samples stored at room temperature for more than 6 hours
◦ Samples that were not aliquoted and were repeatedly frozen
and thawed
1. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
• Plate reader capable of measuring absorbance at appropriate
wavelengths (e.g., 405 nm)
• Calibrated pipettes
• Microplate
• Refrigerated centrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Timer
1. REAGENTS
• C5-depleted human serum
• C5 Complement Standard (Calibrator)
• C5 Functional Complement Assay Kit
• Quality Control Sera
All reagents should be stored and prepared as per manufacturer’s
instructions.
1. PROCEDURE
2. Reagent Preparation:
◦ Thaw C5-depleted human serum and reconstitute according
to kit instructions.
◦ Prepare C5 Complement Standard at various dilutions to
construct a calibration curve.
◦ Prepare all other necessary reagents as specified in the
assay kit insert.
3. Sample Preparation:
◦ Thaw serum samples thoroughly while avoiding multiple
freeze-thaw cycles.
◦ Dilute the serum samples in the provided buffer as specified
by the assay protocol.
4. Assay Protocol:
◦ Dispense a predetermined volume of diluted standards,
controls, and samples into designated wells of a microplate.
◦ Add the appropriate volume of C5-depleted serum to each
well.
◦ Incubate the plate for the time specified in the assay
protocol.
◦ Measure the optical density (OD) at the defined wavelength
using a plate reader.
5. Data Analysis:
◦ Construct a calibration curve using the OD readings of the
standards.
◦ Determine the C5 functional activity in the samples by
comparing the sample ODs to the calibration curve.
◦ Calculate and record the results in the Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Internal Controls:
◦ Run low, medium, and high-level quality controls with each
batch of samples.
◦ Ensure the controls are within the predefined ranges specified
by the assay kit.
• External Controls:
◦ Participate in external proficiency testing programs as
available.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING
• Out-of-Range Controls:
◦ If QC results fall outside allowed ranges, reassess all reagents
and perform system checks.
◦ If the problem persists, do not report patient results and notify
the supervisor.
• Instrument Errors:
◦ Check all instrument settings and recalibrate if necessary.
◦ Perform repeat analysis on any questionable results.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results must be verified and reviewed by the technologist before
reporting.
• Reference Range: Establish reference ranges based on the
assay kit insert or the laboratory's validated ranges.
• Use the following standard units and format for reporting C5
Complement, Functional results:
◦ Report results in CH50 U/mL or the equivalent units specified
by the kit.
1. LIMITATIONS
• Hemolysis, lipemia, or improper sample handling can affect the
assay's accuracy.
• Refer to the manufacturer’s insert for additional limitations specific
to the assay reagents.
