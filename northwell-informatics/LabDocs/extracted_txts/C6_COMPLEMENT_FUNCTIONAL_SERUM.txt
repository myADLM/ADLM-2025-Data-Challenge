SOP: C6 Complement, Functional, Serum
1. PURPOSE
To ensure accurate, timely, and reproducible measurement of C6
Complement, Functional, Serum via enzymatic assay or another
relevant method. This procedure describes the steps for performing
the test, recording results, and addressing any issues that may arise.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
All laboratory personnel authorized and trained in performing C6
Complement, Functional, Serum analysis are responsible for
following these procedures. The laboratory supervisor is responsible
for ensuring that all personnel are adequately trained and maintain
their competency.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
• Specimen Type: Serum
• Collection Requirements:
◦ Preferred collection in serum separator tube (SST)
◦ Allow the blood to clot for 30 minutes at room temperature
◦ Centrifuge promptly at 1,300-1,800 g for 10 minutes
◦ Promptly separate serum from cells
◦ Store and transport the serum samples at 2-8°C
• Unacceptable Specimens:
◦ Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples
◦ Specimens stored at room temperature for more than 48 hours
or refrigerated for more than 7 days without freezing
◦ Samples received in plasma tubes (e.g., EDTA, heparin, etc.)
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Automated immunoassay analyzer or manual spectrophotometer.
• Calibrators and controls
• Assay-specific reagents including C6 Complement functional
assay kits
• Pipettes and tips
• Centrifuge
• Timer
• Refrigerated storage for reagents and samples
5. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform quality control with each assay run using commercially
available controls at multiple levels (e.g., normal, high, low).
• Record lot number, expiration date, and results of each control.
• If control results fall outside acceptable ranges, investigate and
resolve the issue before reporting patient results.
6. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation:
1. Reagent Preparation:
◦ Prepare reagents and calibrators as per the manufacturer’s
instructions.
◦ Ensure all reagents are at the appropriate temperature
before use (usually room temperature).
2. Instrument Preparation:
◦ Verify instrument calibration and maintenance are up to
date.
◦ Perform daily maintenance and function checks as per
instrument manual.
◦ Load assay-specific reagents and calibrators onto the
instrument.
B. Assay Procedure:
1. Load Samples:
◦ Label appropriate tubes or wells with patient identifiers.
◦ Pipette serum samples into designated positions on the
analyzer or manually into wells if performing the assay by
hand.
2. Running Assay on Automated Analyzer:
◦ Program the instrument for the C6 Complement Functional
assay.
◦ Load samples, calibrators, and controls as per instrument
instructions.
◦ Initiate the assay run and monitor for errors.
3. Manual Method:
◦ Pipette predetermined volumes of patient serum, controls,
and calibrators into designated wells.
◦ Add assay-specific reagents as indicated in the assay kit
insert.
◦ Incubate samples at specified temperature and time.
◦ Measure absorbance at designated wavelength using a
spectrophotometer.
4. Assay Completion:
◦ After the run is complete, allow the analyzer to process data
and generate results.
◦ Manually read and record results from the
spectrophotometer if performing the assay manually.
C. Data Review:
1. Results Review:
◦ Verify that control values fall within expected ranges. If
controls are out of range, do not report patient results.
◦ Review patient results for consistency and plausibility.
◦ Address any flags or questionable results by reviewing and
possibly retesting the sample.
2. Data Entry and Verification:
◦ Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
◦ Verify results against patient requisition to ensure accuracy.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results are automatically transmitted to the LIS if using an
automated system and must be reviewed and verified by the
technologist.
• For manual methods, input data directly into the LIS or patient
records.
• Report results in accordance with site-specific guidelines.
8. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• The reference range will be provided with the assay kit and
verified periodically to ensure validity. Common reference
intervals may be around:
◦ 34-61 U/mL (units may vary based on the assay manufacturer)
9. CRITICAL RESULTS AND ACTION
• Critical low results should be flagged and promptly communicated
to the attending clinician.
• Repeat testing may be necessary to confirm results if they are
outside the normal reference ranges.
10. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Specified in the assay kit insert. Consider limitations in assay
sensitivity, specificity, and potential for interference substances.
11. TROUBLESHOOTING
• Refer to instrument and assay kit manuals for troubleshooting
specific issues.
• Document all problems and resolutions in a maintenance log.
• Notify supervisor of any recurring issues.
12. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s assay kit insert and instrumentation manuals.
• Current best practice documents and protocols from relevant
professional organizations.
This protocol is to be reviewed annually and updated as necessary to
ensure compliance with regulatory and methodological standards.
