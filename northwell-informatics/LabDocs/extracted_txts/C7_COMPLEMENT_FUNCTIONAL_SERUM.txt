• Reaction buffers provided in the assay kit
• Substrate solution provided in the assay kit
• Stop solution provided in the assay kit
7. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation
1. Reagent Preparation:
◦ Prepare reagents according to the manufacturer's kit
instructions.
◦ Allow all reagents and specimens to come to room
temperature before use.
2. Calibration and Controls:
◦ Perform instrument calibration using the standards provided
in the kit.
◦ Include both positive and negative controls to ensure the
assay is performing correctly.
B. Assay Procedure
1. Sample Dilution:
◦ Dilute serum samples according to the kit instructions
(typically 1:10 to 1:100 depending on the assay
requirements).
2. Adding Samples to Plate:
◦ Add the appropriate volume of diluted sample to each well
of the assay plate as per the manufacturer's instructions.
◦ Add the controls and standards to designated wells.
3. Incubation:
◦ Incubate the plate at 37°C for the time specified in the kit
instructions.
4. Wash Steps:
◦ Wash the plate as directed in the kit protocol. Typically, this
involves several cycles of adding wash buffer and removing
it by aspiration or decanting.
5. Substrate Addition:
◦ Add the substrate solution to each well according to the kit
instructions.
◦ Incubate for the prescribed time period (usually until color
development is observed).
6. Reaction Termination:
◦ Add the stop solution to each well as per the manufacturer's
recommendations to terminate the reaction.
7. Reading the Plate:
◦ Measure the absorbance of each well at 405 nm using a
microplate reader.
C. Calculation of Results
1. Generation:
◦ Generate the standard curve using the absorbance values
of the standards.
◦ Calculate the C7 complement activity in the serum samples
using the standard curve.
2. Data Review:
◦ Ensure all quality controls are within acceptable ranges
before validating patient results.
◦ Verify that the standard curve shows appropriate linearity
and correlation.
D. Quality Control
1. QC Material:
◦ Run quality control materials with each batch of patient
samples to ensure validity of results.
◦ Document QC results and take corrective actions if controls
are out of the accepted range.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS) for
review.
• Ensure the results are verified by the supervising technologist
before they are released.
• Report any critical values according to laboratory protocol.
9. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If the controls fall outside acceptable ranges, re-evaluate reagent
preparation, equipment calibration, and the assay procedure.
• Document and take appropriate corrective actions to resolve
issues.
