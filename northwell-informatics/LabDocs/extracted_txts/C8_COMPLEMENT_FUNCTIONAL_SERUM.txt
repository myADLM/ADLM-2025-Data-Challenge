C8 COMPLEMENT, FUNCTIONAL, SERUM Protocol:
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is to
outline the process for the analytical phase of testing to determine C8
Complement activity, functional, in serum. This test measures the
activity of the C8 component of the complement system, crucial for
understanding immune function and diagnosing complement
deficiencies.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing the
protocol steps, ensuring quality control, and generating accurate test
results. It is the responsibility of all staff to identify any issues during
testing and report them to supervisors.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Acceptable Specimen:
• Serum collected in a red-top or serum separator tube (SST),
preferably with 5-10 mL of blood.
• Serum should be separated from cells within 2 hours of collection.
• Specimen must be stored at 2-8°C and tested within 48 hours; for
extended storage, serum should be frozen at ≤ -20°C.
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Specimens received in heparinized, EDTA, or citrate tubes, as
these anticoagulants interfere with complement activity.
• Specimens with significant hemolysis.
• Serum specimens older than the stability period without proper
storage.
1. REAGENTS AND EQUIPMENT
Required Reagents:
• C8 Functional Complement Assay Kit (Refer to manufacturer’s
package insert for specific reagents).
• Control sera with known C8 activity levels.
Equipment:
• Calibrated pipettes and embedded tips.
• Test tubes or microplates.
• Microplate reader or spectrophotometer configured for the specific
test.
• Centrifuge.
1. PROCEDURE
2. Preparation:
◦ Allow all reagents and samples to reach room temperature
before use.
◦ Ensure all equipment (Centrifuge, pipettes, microplate
reader) is calibrated and functioning properly.
3. Assay Setup:
◦ Prepare controls and calibrators according to the assay kit
instructions.
◦ Set up the microplate or tubes with appropriate volumes of
sample, controls, and reagents as per the kit instructions.
◦ Ensure each assay includes a blank, negative and positive
controls.
4. Incubation:
◦ Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for any incubation
periods. Typically, this involves adding reagents and
incubating at specified temperatures and times to allow
antigen-antibody reactions.
5. Measurement:
◦ Measure the absorbance at the specified wavelength using
a microplate reader or spectrophotometer. Record the data
correctly.
6. Calculations:
◦ Calculate the functional activity of C8 complement using the
formula provided in the assay kit’s instructions.
◦ Compare the patient sample’s absorbance to the standard
curve generated from controls and calibrators.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Each batch must include internal quality controls (Low and High
level) for validation.
• Results should be consistent with the known standard ranges for
controls. If controls are out of range, troubleshoot the procedure
and repeat the test.
• Regular maintenance and calibration of equipment should be
documented.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Enter the results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Review and verify results for consistency and accuracy.
• Report results according to site-specific guidelines, include
reference ranges.
Reference Range:
• Report patient results along with reference intervals as provided
by the manufacturer’s package insert or validated norms.
• Typical functional C8 ranges can be referenced against
population norms provided within the assay kit.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Cross-referenced limitations as mentioned in the assay kit
instructions.
• Hemolysis or incorrect sample handling can drastically affect
complement activity, necessitating strict adherence to specimen
collection and handling protocols.

handling and processing.
By adhering to this protocol, the laboratory ensures reliable and
accurate determination of C8 complement activity in serum
specimens, contributing essential data for patient care and diagnosis
of complement-related disorders.
