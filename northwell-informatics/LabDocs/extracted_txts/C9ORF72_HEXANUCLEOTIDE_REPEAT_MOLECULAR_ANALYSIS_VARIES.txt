4. SAMPLE PREPARATION
1. DNA Extraction:
◦ Extract genomic DNA from collected biological specimen
using appropriate DNA extraction kit as per manufacturer’s
instructions.
◦ Quantify the DNA using a nanodrop or Qubit fluorometer to
ensure suitable concentration and purity (A260/A280 ratio
~1.8).
2. Sample Storage:
◦ Store extracted DNA at -20°C until further analysis.
◦ Perform all steps on ice or using cooled centrifuge
equipment where applicable.
5. PROCEDURE
5.1 PCR Amplification:
1. Prepare PCR Master Mix:
◦ Mix the following components on ice for each reaction:
▪ 12.5µL PCR Master Mix
▪ 1µL Forward Primer (10 µM)
▪ 1µL Reverse Primer (10 µM)
▪ 2µL genomic DNA (20 ng/µL)
▪ Nuclease-free H2O to a final volume of 25µL
2. Load PCR tubes into the thermocycler:
◦ Set the thermocycler with the following program:
▪ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 5 minutes
▪ 35 cycles of:
▪ Denaturation: 95°C for 30 seconds
▪ Annealing: 60°C for 30 seconds
▪ Extension: 72°C for 1 minute
▪ Final extension: 72°C for 10 minutes
▪ Hold at 4°C
5.2 Detection of PCR Products:
1. Agarose Gel Electrophoresis:
◦ Prepare a 2% agarose gel by dissolving agarose powder in
1X TAE buffer.
◦ Add ethidium bromide or alternative gel stain to the molten
agarose.
◦ Pour agarose solution into the gel tray with combs and let it
set.
◦ Load the PCR product mixed with loading dye into the wells
of the gel.
◦ Include DNA ladder and control samples in separate wells.
◦ Run the gel at 100V for approximately 1 hour or until bands
are well separated.
2. Visualization:
◦ Place the gel on a UV transilluminator.
◦ Photograph the gel and document the result using gel
documentation system.
◦ Analyze the band patterns corresponding to the expansion
size of the hexanucleotide repeats.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Positive and Negative Controls:
◦ Include positive controls (normal, premutation, and full
mutation repeat DNA samples) and negative control (no
template) in each batch of PCR reactions to ensure assay
performance.
◦ Verify that control samples produce the expected band
sizes.
2. Repeat Testing:
◦ All samples should be run in duplicate to ensure the
accuracy of the result.
◦ If discrepancies are noted between duplicates, repeat the
analysis.
3. Gel Documentation:
◦ Document all pertinent details such as gel picture, sample
IDs, date, and initials of the performing technician.
7. DATA INTERPRETATION AND REPORTING
1. Data Interpretation:
◦ Compare the size of the PCR products to the DNA ladder to
determine the number of repeats.
◦ Identify mutation carrier status based on the number of
repeats observed:
▪ Normal: (≤ 30 repeats)
▪ Premutation: (31-100 repeats)
▪ Full mutation: (>100 repeats)
2. Results Documentation and Verification:
◦ Document all results in the laboratory information system
(LIS).
◦ Verify that the results are accurate and consistent with
obtained gel images.
◦ Flag any abnormal results for repeat testing and additional
verification.
8. RECORD KEEPING
• Maintain all records related to DNA extraction, PCR setup, gel
electrophoresis, and data analysis in a laboratory logbook.
• Ensure that log books are dated, signed, and securely stored as
per laboratory policy.
• Ensure electronic records are backed up regularly.
9. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer instructions for DNA extraction kits, PCR
Thermocycler, and reagents.
• Peer-reviewed publications on C9ORF72 hexanucleotide repeat
expansions for reference ranges and interpretations.
