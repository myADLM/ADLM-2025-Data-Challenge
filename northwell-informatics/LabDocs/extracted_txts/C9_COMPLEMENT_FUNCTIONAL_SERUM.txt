STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE
Title: Generating Results for C9 Complement, Functional, Serum
Effective Date: [Insert Date]
Review Date: [Insert Date]
Version: 1.0
1. PURPOSE
To establish a standardized procedure for the analysis of C9
Complement, Functional, Serum to ensure accuracy and
reproducibility of patient test results.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel responsible for the
analysis of C9 Complement, Functional, Serum in the [Laboratory
Name].
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Technologist: Responsible for performing the analytical
procedure as outlined and ensuring quality control measures are
adhered to.
• Supervisor: Responsible for ensuring the staff follow the
procedure correctly and performing any necessary
troubleshooting.
• Laboratory Director: Responsible for final review and approval
of results.
4. DEFINITION
C9 Complement is a serum protein involved in the terminal
complement pathway, contributing to cell lysis. The functional assay
measures the activity level of C9 in forming the membrane attack
complex.
5. REAGENTS AND EQUIPMENT
• C9 Complement Functional Assay Kit
• Calibrators and Controls (as specified in the assay kit)
• Appropriate diluents and buffer solutions
• Plate reader capable of reading absorbance at the required
wavelength
• Microplate washer
• Pipettes and tips
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
• Serological centrifuge
6. SAMPLE REQUIREMENTS
• Serum sample
• preferred sample collection: 5 mL of blood collected in a red-top
tube
• The sample should be centrifuged, and serum separated within 1
hour of collection to avoid complement activation.
• Store serum at -20°C if the assay is not performed immediately.
Avoid repeated freeze/thaw cycles.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run the provided controls with each batch of samples.
• QC materials should cover the clinically relevant range of the
assay.
• Acceptable criteria for controls must be defined based on the kit’s
specifications.
8. CALIBRATION
• Calibrate the plate reader as per manufacturer's instructions
before use.
• Perform assay calibration using the standards provided in the kit.
Follow kit instructions for preparing the calibration curve.
9. PROCEDURE
9.1 Preparation
1. Equipment Setup:
◦ Turn on the plate reader and allow it to warm up.
◦ Calibrate the plate reader if necessary.
2. Reagent Preparation:
◦ Prepare all reagents as per the assay kit instructions.
3. Calibrator and Control Preparation:
◦ Prepare calibrators and controls as specified in the assay
kit.
9.2 Conducting the Assay
1. Sample Preparation:
◦ Thaw serum samples and control specimens.
◦ Mix gently and aliquot appropriate volumes as instructed in
the kit.
2. Plate Loading:
◦ Add appropriate volumes of standards, controls, and
samples to the designated wells in duplicate or triplicate, as
per assay kit instructions.
3. Assay Execution:
◦ Follow the procedural steps outlined in the assay kit for
incubation times, washing steps, and reagent additions.
◦ Ensure adherence to all incubation times and environmental
conditions (e.g., temperature).
4. Reading the Plate:
◦ Measure absorbance at the specified wavelength using the
plate reader.
◦ Export or record raw data for analysis.
9.3 Data Analysis
1. Calibration Curve:
◦ Generate a calibration curve using the standards.
◦ Plot absorbance values against the concentration of the
standards provided.
◦ Use appropriate software or manual calculations to
determine sample concentrations from the calibration curve.
2. QC Assessment:
◦ Review QC results to ensure they meet acceptable criteria.
◦ If QC fails, identify and document any errors. Repeat the
assay if necessary.
3. Sample Result Calculation:
◦ Calculate the C9 complement activity in the patient serum
samples using the calibration curve.
10. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Review Data:
◦ Review all control and sample data to ensure accuracy.
◦ Verify that all procedural steps followed and any deviations
were documented.
2. Result Entry:
◦ Enter patient results into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
◦ Ensure results are checked and authorized as per
laboratory policy.
3. Critical Values:
◦ Handle any critical results according to the laboratory’s
Critical Results Policy.
◦ Document all communication of critical results appropriately.
11. STORAGE AND STABILITY
• Store remaining serum samples at -80°C for potential reruns.
• Store reagents according to the manufacturer's instructions.
• Dispose of waste materials according to the laboratory's waste
disposal protocols.
12. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's Assay Kit Instructions for Use (IFU).
• Laboratory Standard Operating Procedures Manual.
• Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines.
13. DOCUMENT CONTROL
• SOP version number, effective date, review date, and any
revisions should be clearly documented.
• Maintaining a log of any amendments and ensuring all personnel
are informed of updates.
