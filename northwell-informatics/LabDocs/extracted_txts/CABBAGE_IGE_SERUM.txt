Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for CABBAGE, IGE, and SERUM
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedures for the analysis
of CABBAGE, IGE, and SERUM samples during the analytical
phase, ensuring accurate and reliable results. This includes proper
sample handling, reagent preparation, equipment usage, and result
documentation.

6. PROCEDURE
A. CABBAGE Analysis
1. Preparation of Reagents and Standards
◦ Prepare all reagents as per the manufacturer's instructions.
◦ Calibrate the analytical balance before use.
◦ Thaw and prepare calibration standards and quality control
materials.
2. Sample Preparation
◦ Centrifuge the collected specimen at 3000 RPM for 10
minutes.
◦ Aliquot the supernatant into labeled microcentrifuge tubes.
3. Assay Procedure
◦ Add 100 µL of each sample, standard, and control to
designated wells on the 96-well microplate.
◦ Add 50 µL of conjugate reagent to each well.
◦ Incubate the plate at 37°C for 30 minutes.
◦ Wash the plate three times with wash buffer.
◦ Add 100 µL of TMB substrate to each well.
◦ Incubate in the dark at room temperature for 15 minutes.
◦ Add 50 µL of stop solution and measure the absorbance
using an ELISA plate reader at 450 nm.
4. Result Calculation
◦ Calculate the concentration of CABBAGE using the
standard curve generated from the calibration standards.
B. IGE Analysis
1. Preparation of Reagents and Standards
◦ Reconstitute IGE calibrators, controls, and reagent kits as
per the manufacturer's instructions.
◦ Ensure automated immunoassay analyzer is calibrated and
prepared for use.
2. Sample Preparation
◦ Thaw and mix the serum samples thoroughly.
◦ Load samples, calibrators, and controls into the designated
positions on the analyzer.
3. Assay Procedure
◦ Start the IGE analysis program on the automated
immunoassay analyzer.
◦ The analyzer will process samples automatically, including
reagent addition, incubation, and measurement.
4. Result Calculation
◦ The analyzer will automatically generate results for IGE
concentration in each sample. Verify and print the results.
C. SERUM Analysis
1. Preparation of Reagents and Standards
◦ Prepare serum reagent kits and calibration standards
following the manufacturer's instructions.
◦ Calibrate the analytical balance and other necessary
equipment.
2. Sample Preparation
◦ Thaw serum samples and centrifuge if necessary.
◦ Aliquot into labeled microcentrifuge tubes.
3. Assay Procedure
◦ Pipette 50 µL of sample, standard, and controls into the
designated wells of a 96-well microplate or automated
analyzer.
◦ Follow the assay procedure specified in the reagent kit
protocol, including any incubation, washing, and reading
steps.
4. Result Calculation
◦ Use the standard curve and control data to calculate the
concentration of serum analytes.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include positive and negative controls in each run to ensure assay
accuracy.
• Perform calibration checks and maintenance on analytical
instruments as per the schedule.
• Document all quality control results, and take immediate
corrective action if controls fall out of range.
8. DOCUMENTATION
• Record all analytical data, including raw results, instrument
printouts, and calculations, in the laboratory information system
(LIS).
• Ensure all documentation is complete and accurate before
verifying and releasing results.
9. SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS
• Follow all laboratory safety guidelines, including the use of
personal protective equipment (PPE).
• Dispose of biological waste and reagents according to established
protocols.

This SOP will be reviewed and updated annually or as necessary to
ensure compliance with current standards and practices. All
personnel must be trained on this SOP before performing CABBAGE,
IGE, and SERUM analyses.
