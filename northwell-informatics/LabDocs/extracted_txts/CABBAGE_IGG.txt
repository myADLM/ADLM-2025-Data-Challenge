Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase Protocol for Generating Results for CABBAGE
IGG
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the procedures for the analytical phase of
generating results for CABBAGE IGG in a CLIA-certified laboratory,
including the preparation, analysis, and documentation steps
required to ensure accurate and reliable results.
Responsibility:
All designated laboratory personnel are responsible for following this
protocol to ensure proper handling, analysis, and documentation of
CABBAGE IGG results.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/acceptable specimens:
• Serum or plasma samples collected in a SST (Serum Separator
Tube) or EDTA tube.
Specimen stability:
• Serum: Stable for up to 48 hours at 2-8°C. Stable for up to 6
months at -20°C.
• Plasma: Stable for up to 24 hours at 2-8°C. Stable for up to 3
months at -20°C.
Unacceptable specimens:
• Hemolytic samples
• Samples with significant lipemia or icterus
• Samples received in unapproved collection tubes or containers
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Required equipment:
• Automated immunoassay analyzer
• Precision pipettes and tips
• Centrifuge
• Vortex mixer
Required reagents:
• CABBAGE IGG reagent kit (including standards, controls, and
reagents)
• Diluent solutions
• Calibration solutions
Supplies:
• Gloves, lab coats, and other personal protective equipment (PPE)
• Sample centrifuge tubes or cups
• Reagent reservoirs
1. PROCEDURE
A) Sample Preparation:
1. Ensure specimens are properly collected, labeled, and stored
according to the specimen requirements.
2. Centrifuge samples at 1500 x g for 10 minutes to separate
serum/plasma from cellular components.
3. Carefully transfer serum/plasma into labeled sample cups or
tubes, avoiding any hemolysis or contamination.
B) Calibration and Quality Control:
1. Perform calibration of the immunoassay analyzer according to
the manufacturer’s instructions using the provided calibration
solutions.
2. Run quality control (QC) samples including high, low, and
negative controls to verify the accuracy and precision of the
assay. Document QC results.
3. If QC results are within acceptable range, proceed with sample
analysis. If QC results are outside acceptable ranges,
troubleshoot as necessary and repeat QC.
C) Sample Analysis:
1. Load sample tubes/cups into the immunoassay analyzer
following the manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Program the analyzer with the appropriate assay settings for
CABBAGE IGG, including sample IDs and dilution factors if
applicable.
3. Start the analysis run, ensuring that all instrument settings and
sample loading are correct.
4. Upon completion of the run, review all generated data for any
flagged results or errors.
D) Data Documentation and Verification:
1. Verify all results, ensuring that each result meets the criteria for
quality and accuracy.
2. Document all results, including any comments for flagged data
or necessary repeat analyses.
3. Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
4. If critical values are identified, follow laboratory protocol for
reporting critical results to the requesting healthcare provider.
5. REPORTING RESULTS
Results should be reviewed and verified by the technologist before
being released. All results must be entered into the LIS, and flagged
or critical results should be handled according to laboratory protocols
for verification, documentation, and notification.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the manufacturer’s instructions in the CABBAGE IGG
reagent kit insert for limitations of the immunoassay method. These
may include known interferences, sensitivity, specificity, and potential
cross-reactivity with other analytes.
