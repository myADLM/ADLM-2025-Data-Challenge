Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for CACAO/COCOA, IgE, Serum
1. PURPOSE This SOP defines the analytical procedures to be
followed for testing CACAO/COCOA, IgE (Immunoglobulin E) in
serum samples. The goal is to ensure accurate and reliable results,
adherence to quality control standards, and appropriate
documentation.
2. RESPONSIBILITY Laboratory technicians and scientists are
responsible for following this SOP. Supervisors ensure that proper
training is provided and compliance is maintained.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred Specimen: Serum
• Collection Volume: At least 2 mL
• Storage: Store serum samples at 2-8°C for up to 48 hours. For
prolonged storage, freeze at -20°C or lower.
• Unacceptable Specimens: Specimens containing hemolysis,
lipemia, or those showing signs of bacterial contamination.
4. REAGENTS AND EQUIPMENT
• Calibrators and controls specific for CACAO/COCOA and IgE
• Automated Immunoassay Analyzer (compatible with the reagents)
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes and tips
• Vortex mixer
• Refrigerator and freezer
• Serum separator tubes (SST)
5. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation
1. Verify that the analyzer is appropriately calibrated and
maintained as per manufacturer guidelines.
2. Ensure that all reagents are within their expiration date and
properly stored.
3. Perform daily quality control checks with calibrators and
controls to validate the performance of the analyzer.
B. Sample Processing
1. Specimen Reception and Preparation a. Upon receipt, verify
the specimen labeling against the requisition form. b. Centrifuge
the SST at 1500-2000 x g for 10 minutes to separate the serum
if not already done. c. Transfer the serum to a labeled aliquot
tube if necessary.
2. Loading Specimen on Analyzer a. Allow frozen samples to
reach room temperature before analysis. b. Vortex mix serum
samples gently to ensure uniformity. c. Load the calibrators,
controls, and patient samples onto the designated positions on
the analyzer.
3. Running the Assay a. Select the appropriate assay protocol
for CACAO/COCOA, IgE on the analyzer’s user interface. b.
Initiate the analysis sequence as per the manufacturer’s
operating procedures.
C. Quality Control
1. Internal Quality Control a. Run internal quality control
samples (high, medium, and low) at the beginning of each day
and with each new reagent lot. b. Ensure quality control results
are within acceptable ranges before proceeding with patient
sample testing.
2. Troubleshooting a. If control samples fall outside acceptable
ranges, troubleshoot as per the analyzer’s manual. b. Re-run
the controls after adjustments or notify the supervisor if the
issue persists.
D. Result Interpretation and Reporting
1. Reviewing Results a. Examine the analyzer’s printout for each
patient sample. b. Verify flags or error codes and repeat
analysis if necessary.
2. Result Documentation a. Document all results in the
Laboratory Information System (LIS). b. Include necessary
comments if analysis is affected by any limitations or procedural
anomalies.
3. Critical Results and Notification a. Immediately notify the
requesting physician for any critical values as defined by
laboratory policy. b. Document the notification including date,
time, and the individuals contacted.
E. Clean-Up
1. Dispose of all used reagents and consumables following the
laboratory’s biohazard and chemical waste disposal protocols.
2. Clean the work area and the analyzer as per manufacturer’s
guidelines.
6. METHOD LIMITATIONS Refer to the manufacturer’s insert for
potential limitations and interference factors affecting CACAO/
COCOA and IgE results.
7. REFERENCES
1. Manufacturer’s Guidelines for Immunoassay Analyzer.
2. Reagent Package Inserts for CACAO/COCOA, IgE.
3. Laboratory Quality Control Manual.
8. DOCUMENTATION
Ensure all logs including temperature, calibration, quality control, and
maintenance logs are filled in accurately and timely.
9. TRAINING
Technologists must undergo training and annual competency
assessments in the use of the immunoassay analyzer and the
specific testing procedures for CACAO/COCOA, IgE.
This protocol ensures consistent, accurate, and high-quality results
for CACAO/COCOA, IgE testing in serum, in line with laboratory
standards and regulations.
