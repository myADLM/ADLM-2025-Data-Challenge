Protocol for the Analytical Phase of Generating Results for
CADMIUM, 24 HOUR, URINE
1. PURPOSE
To establish a standardized procedure for the analytical phase of
generating results for cadmium testing in 24-hour urine samples.
2. SCOPE
This protocol applies to all personnel in the laboratory involved in the
analysis of cadmium in 24-hour urine specimens.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for the proper
handling, processing, analysis, and reporting of results for cadmium
in 24-hour urine samples.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred Container: Specimen collected in a clean, chemically
resistant, and appropriately labeled 24-hour urine container.
• Preservation: Immediately after collecting the 24-hour urine
sample, it should be refrigerated or kept on ice.
• Compliance Check: Ensure the total volume of urine is sufficient
and properly recorded on the container.
• Unacceptable Conditions: Specimens received without
preservation, specimens not stored properly, or incomplete 24-
hour collections must be rejected.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Analytical balance
• Clean, metal-free plastic vials
• TraceMetal™ Grade nitric acid
• Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS)
instrument
• Calibration standards (certified reference material for cadmium)
• Quality control samples (high and low concentration levels)
• Deionized water (ASTM Type I)
6. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation:
1. Preparation of Calibration Standards:
◦ Prepare a series of calibration standards by diluting the
certified reference material with deionized water and adding
TraceMetal™ Grade nitric acid to match the matrix of urine
samples.
2. Preparation of Quality Control Samples:
◦ Use certified materials to prepare high and low
concentration quality control samples to validate the
accuracy and precision of the procedure.
3. Sample Aliquoting:
◦ Thoroughly mix the 24-hour urine collection.
◦ Measure and record the total volume of the urine sample.
◦ Aliquot an appropriate volume of the mixed urine into clean,
metal-free vials for analysis.
◦ Acidify the urine aliquot with TraceMetal™ Grade nitric acid
to preserve the sample.
B. Analytical Process:
1. ICP-MS Instrument Preparation:
◦ Warm-up the ICP-MS instrument following the
manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Perform routine maintenance and ensure proper calibration
of the instrument.
◦ Load the calibration standards and quality control samples
into the auto-sampler.
2. Calibration Curve Generation:
◦ Analyze the calibration standards to generate a calibration
curve.
◦ Ensure the correlation coefficient (R²) is ≥ 0.995 for the
calibration curve before proceeding.
3. Sample Analysis:
◦ Analyze the quality control samples to ensure the instrument
is operating within acceptable limits.
◦ Load and analyze the patient’s 24-hour urine samples.
◦ Include at least one quality control sample after every ten
patient samples.
7. QUALITY CONTROL AND MONITORING
• Internal Quality Control:
◦ Assess the ICP-MS performance daily using quality control
samples before analyzing patient specimens.
◦ Document and verify the analytical runs for consistency and
accuracy.
◦ Recalibrate the instrument if quality control results are outside
the defined acceptance criteria.
• External Quality Assurance:
◦ Participate in external proficiency testing programs to validate
analytical procedures and compare results with peer
laboratories.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Data Handling:
◦ Review all analytical data for accuracy and precision.
◦ Identify any outliers or inconsistencies and reanalyze if
necessary.
• Result Calculation:
◦ Calculate the cadmium concentration in µg/L.
◦ Normalize the concentration based on the total volume of the
24-hour urine collection to obtain the final result in µg/24
hours.
• Documentation:
◦ Document the results in the laboratory information system
(LIS).
◦ Ensure the results are verified and released by authorized
personnel.
9. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Normal Range: < 50 µg/24 hours
10. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to the ICP-MS manufacturer's instructions and provided
method for any specific limitations and troubleshooting
procedures associated with cadmium analysis in urine.
