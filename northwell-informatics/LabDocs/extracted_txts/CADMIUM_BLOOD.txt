Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to outline the steps required for the
analytical phase in the determination of cadmium levels in blood
samples, ensuring accuracy, precision, and compliance with
regulatory standards.
Responsibility:
Designated staff are responsible for performing the cadmium testing
on blood samples according to this procedure. All personnel involved
in the testing must be trained and competent.
1. REAGENTS and SUPPLIES
• Reagents:
◦ Cadmium standard solutions
◦ Deionized water
◦ Nitric acid (trace metal grade)
◦ Triton X-100 or similar surfactant
◦ Quality control materials (Low, Medium, High cadmium
concentrations)
• Supplies:
◦ Blood collection tubes (Royal blue-top with EDTA)
◦ Micropipettes and tips
◦ Disposable gloves
◦ Laboratory coat
◦ Safety goggles
◦ Calibrated atomic absorption spectrophotometer (AAS) or
inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS)
◦ Calibration standards
◦ Certified reference materials
◦ Sample digestion equipment (if required)
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
• Preferred Specimen: Whole blood collected in royal blue-top
tubes containing EDTA.
• Unacceptable Specimens:
◦ Clotted specimens
◦ Hemolyzed specimens
• Stability: Blood specimens should be analyzed as soon as
possible. If storage is necessary, samples should be stored at
2-8°C for up to 5 days. For longer storage, freeze at -20°C and
avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
1. PROCEDURE
Preparation and Digestion of Samples:
A. Sample Preparation:
1. Don appropriate PPE (gloves, laboratory coat, safety goggles).
2. Centrifuge the blood collection tube at 1500 RPM for 10
minutes at 4°C to obtain plasma and cellular fractions if
needed.
B. Digestion (if required):
1. Transfer 0.5 mL of whole blood/plasma to a digestion vessel.
2. Add 1 mL of concentrated nitric acid.
3. Heat the sample gently to 80°C until the sample is clear,
indicating complete digestion.
4. Dilute the digested sample to 10 mL with deionized water.
5. Allow the sample to cool to room temperature.
Calibration and Quality Control:
A. Calibration:
1. Calibrate the AAS or ICP-MS system using cadmium standard
solutions (0, 1, 5, 10, and 20 µg/L).
2. Ensure that the calibration curve has an acceptable linearity (R²
≥ 0.995).
B. Quality Control:
1. Run quality control samples (Low, Medium, High cadmium
concentrations) at the beginning, middle, and end of each
analytical batch.
2. Accept results if QC samples are within ±10% of the target
value.
Analyzing Samples:
A. Sample Analysis:
1. Aspirate each sample into the AAS or ICP-MS.
2. Record the instrument response for each sample.
3. Generate the cadmium concentration from the calibration curve.
B. Run Continuity:
1. Check instrument performance periodically during the analysis
using control and calibration standards.
2. If control results fall outside the acceptable limits, stop the
analysis, recalibrate the instrument, and reanalyze the affected
samples.
Post-Analysis:
A. Review of Results:
1. Ensure all results for patient specimens are within the
reportable range.
2. Validate results against quality control data.
3. Note any instances of QC failure and corrective actions taken.
B. Reporting Results:
1. Document results in the laboratory information system (LIS).
2. Any results falling outside the reference range should be
flagged and reviewed by a supervisor.
3. Ensure timely communication of critical values as per laboratory
protocol.
4. QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE
• Internal QC: Perform QC with every batch of samples run. Plot
QC data to monitor performance over time.
• External Proficiency Testing: Participate in an accredited
external proficiency testing program for cadmium in blood at least
twice a year.
• Instrument Maintenance: Perform regular maintenance and
calibrations as per the manufacturer’s recommendation.
