SOP: CADMIUM/CREATININE RATIO, RANDOM, URINE
1. PURPOSE
To ensure the accurate and precise measurement of cadmium and
creatinine levels in random urine samples for the calculation of the
cadmium/creatinine ratio. This ratio is widely used to assess
exposure to cadmium, particularly in occupational health monitoring.
Responsibility:
All trained and authorized laboratory personnel are responsible for
performing the test as per this SOP. It is the responsibility of the lab
supervisor to ensure that all personnel performing this assay are
adequately trained and competent.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
• Preferred/acceptable: Random urine sample collected in a
clean, plastic, chemically resistant container without any
preservative.
• Volume: Minimum of 10 mL of urine is required.
• Storage:
◦ Short-term: Refrigerate at 2-8° C, stable for up to 72 hours.
◦ Long-term: Freeze at -20° C, stable for up to one year.
1. EQUIPMENT, SUPPLIES, AND REAGENTS
• Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer (AAS) with graphite
furnace, or Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer (ICP-
MS).
• Creatinine analyzer or equivalent method validated for urine
samples.
• Cadmium calibration standards.
• Creatinine calibration standards.
• Quality control materials for both cadmium and creatinine
(commercially available or in-house prepared).
• Laboratory glassware and plasticware (pipettes, beakers, sample
tubes).
• Laboratory grade deionized water.
• Appropriate safety equipment (gloves, lab coat, safety glasses).
1. PROCEDURE
A. Cadmium Measurement
1. Preparation of Calibration Standards and Quality Controls:
◦ Prepare cadmium calibration standards from a stock
solution to cover the expected concentration range in the
samples.
◦ Prepare quality control materials at low, medium, and high
concentrations within the range of expected sample values.
2. Sample Preparation:
◦ Thoroughly mix each urine specimen by inverting the
container several times.
◦ Aliquot 1-2 mL of the specimen into a sample tube.
3. Measurement of Cadmium:
◦ Follow the operation manual for the Atomic Absorption
Spectrophotometer or ICP-MS.
◦ Run the calibration standards, quality controls, and urine
samples.
◦ Ensure that quality control results fall within the established
acceptable range before proceeding with sample analysis.
4. Quality Control:
◦ Analyze both low, medium, and high concentration quality
controls at the start, mid-run, and at the end of the sample
analysis session.
◦ The results must fall within the established acceptable
quality control limits.
B. Creatinine Measurement
1. Preparation of Calibration Standards and Quality Controls:
◦ Prepare creatinine calibration standards from a stock
solution to cover the expected concentration range.
◦ Prepare quality control materials at various concentrations
within the expected range of creatinine values.
2. Sample Preparation:
◦ Use the same urine aliquot for creatinine measurement that
was used for cadmium measurement.
3. Measurement of Creatinine:
◦ Follow the operation manual for the creatinine analyzer.
◦ Run the calibration standards, quality controls, and urine
samples.
◦ Confirm quality control results fall within the established
acceptable range before proceeding with sample analysis.
4. Quality Control:
◦ Same as the cadmium measurement procedure.
C. Calculation of Cadmium/Creatinine Ratio
1. Data Entry:
◦ Input concentration values obtained from the measurements
of cadmium and creatinine into the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
2. Ratio Calculation:
◦ Calculate the Cadmium/Creatinine Ratio using the formula:
▪ Ratio (µg/g) = (Concentration of Cadmium in urine (µg/L)
/ Concentration of Creatinine in urine (mg/dL)) × 100
3. REPORTING AND DOCUMENTATION
• Results should be automatically transmitted to the LIS and
reviewed by the technologist.
• Any critical or significantly abnormal results must be
communicated to the referring physician or relevant authority
immediately as per laboratory policy.
• Maintain records of all calibration standards, quality control
results, and instrument maintenance logs as per laboratory
protocols.
1. QUALITY CONTROL AND MAINTENANCE
• Ensure regular maintenance of the analytical instrumentation as
per manufacturer guidelines.
• Regularly review quality control charts to identify any trends or
shifts in performance.
• Participate in external quality assurance programs periodically to
ensure the accuracy and reliability of test results.
