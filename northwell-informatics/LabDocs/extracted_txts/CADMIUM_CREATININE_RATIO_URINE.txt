Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
CADMIUM/CREATININE RATIO, URINE
1. PURPOSE
This SOP explains the procedures for the analysis of Cadmium and
Creatinine concentrations in urine specimens for the calculation of
the Cadmium/Creatinine ratio. The ratio helps assess cadmium
exposure and renal function in patients.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel responsible for the
analysis of urine samples for cadmium and creatinine concentrations
and calculating the Cadmium/Creatinine ratio.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of designated laboratory personnel to ensure
that this procedure is strictly followed. Supervisors must ensure that
all personnel conducting the test are adequately trained and
competent.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen type: Random urine or 24-hour urine collection.
• Volume: Minimum 10 mL.
• Container: Acid-washed plastic containers free from metal
contamination.
• Storage: Store samples at 4°C if analysis is to be conducted
within 72 hours. For longer storage, freeze samples at -20°C.
5. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• Reagents:
◦ Nitric acid (concentrated, trace metal grade)
◦ Deionized water
◦ Standards for Cadmium and Creatinine (NIST traceable)
• Supplies:
◦ PPE (gloves, lab coat, safety goggles)
◦ Acid-washed tubes
◦ Pipettes and tips
◦ Analytical balances
◦ Centrifuge
◦ Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) for
cadmium analysis
◦ Automated analyzer for creatinine measurement
6. EQUIPMENT PREPARATION AND VALIDATION
• Validate ICP-MS for cadmium detection against certified reference
material before each batch of specimens.
• Calibrate the automated analyzer for creatinine measurement
daily according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
• Perform quality control checks with both high and low controls for
both cadmium and creatinine methods before analyzing patient
specimens.
7. PROCEDURE
Cadmium Measurement:
1. Sample Preparation:
◦ Mix the urine sample by inverting the container several
times.
◦ Transfer 2 mL of urine to an acid-washed, trace metal-free
tube.
◦ Add 0.5 mL of concentrated nitric acid to the sample, mix
gently, and let it sit for 30 minutes.
◦ Centrifuge the sample at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes to remove
any particulate matter.
◦ Transfer the supernatant to another clean tube for analysis.
2. ICP-MS Analysis:
◦ Set up and calibrate the ICP-MS instrument using the
cadmium standards.
◦ Run a blank sample followed by quality control samples.
◦ Inject 1 mL of the prepared urine sample into the ICP-MS.
◦ Record the concentration of cadmium in μg/L.
Creatinine Measurement:
1. Sample Preparation:
◦ Mix the urine sample by inverting the container several
times.
◦ Transfer an appropriate volume of urine to the analytical
cup/tube specified by the automated analyzer.
2. Automated Analyzer Procedure:
◦ Calibrate the instrument using the creatinine standards.
◦ Run a blank sample followed by quality control samples.
◦ Analyze the urine sample for creatinine concentration.
◦ Record the concentration of creatinine in mg/dL.
8. CALCULATION OF CADMIUM/CREATININE RATIO:
• Convert cadmium concentration from μg/L to μg/g creatinine using
the formula:
[ \text{Cadmium/Creatinine Ratio} ,(\mu g/g) =
\frac{\text{Cadmium (μg/L)}}{\text{Creatinine (mg/dL)}} \times 10 ]
9. QUALITY CONTROL:
• Run quality control samples at the beginning of each batch and
after every 20 samples.
• Acceptable ranges should be determined based on the
laboratory’s established quality control program.
• Re-run any out-of-range quality control samples and associated
patient samples if initial QC fails.
10. REPORTING RESULTS:
• Enter the Cadmium/Creatinine Ratio into the Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
• Review and verify results before releasing them to ensure they fall
within the laboratory’s established reference ranges.
11. DOCUMENTATION:
• Document all calibrations, maintenance, and any corrective
actions taken in instrument logs.
• Record quality control results and any associated follow-up
actions in the laboratory’s QC records.
• Keep all documentation as per the laboratory’s record retention
policy.
12. REFERENCES:
• Manufacturer’s manuals for ICP-MS and automated creatinine
analyzer
• Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines
• Relevant peer-reviewed scientific literature on cadmium and
creatinine analysis in urine.
Note: This SOP should be reviewed and updated annually or
whenever significant procedural changes are implemented.
