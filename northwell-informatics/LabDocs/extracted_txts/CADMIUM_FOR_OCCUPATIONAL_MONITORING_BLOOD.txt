Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical
Phase of Generating Results for Cadmium for
Occupational Monitoring, Blood
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to provide a detailed protocol for the
analysis of cadmium in blood for occupational monitoring to ensure
accurate, reliable, and reproducible results.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of all laboratory scientists and technicians to
adhere to this protocol for the analysis of cadmium in blood samples.
The supervisor is responsible for ensuring compliance with this SOP
and addressing any deviations or non-conformances.
2. DEFINITIONS
• Cadmium (Cd): A toxic heavy metal monitored in occupational
settings.
• ICP-MS: Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry, the
analytical technique used for cadmium detection.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred Specimen: Whole blood, collected in a trace element-
free, lavender-top (EDTA) tube.
• Volume: At least 2 mL.
• Stability: Samples are stable for up to 7 days refrigerated (2-8°C)
and for up to 1 year when frozen (-20°C or lower).
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Equipment:
◦ Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer (ICP-MS)
◦ Centrifuge
◦ Trace element-free lab ware (polypropylene or Teflon)
◦ Calibrated micropipettes
◦ Automated sample diluter (if available)
• Reagents:
◦ High purity water (18.2 MΩ.cm)
◦ Trace metal grade nitric acid (HNO3)
◦ Certified cadmium stock standard solution
◦ Internal standard solution (e.g., Indium)
◦ Calibration standards (prepared from cadmium stock solution)
5. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation
1. Sample Handling:
◦ Upon receipt, verify that the sample is correctly labeled and
the volume is adequate.
◦ Mix the blood sample by gentle inversion to avoid
hemolysis.
2. Pre-treatment:
◦ Centrifuge the blood samples at 1500-2000 x g for 10
minutes to separate plasma from cells.
◦ Aliquot 0.5 mL of blood into a trace element-free tube for
analysis.
3. Digestion:
◦ Add 1 mL of trace metal grade nitric acid to the blood
aliquot.
◦ Digest the sample in a microwave digestion system
according to the manufacturer's recommendations.
◦ Allow the sample to cool to room temperature and dilute to
10 mL with high purity water.
B. Calibration of ICP-MS
1. Calibration Standards:
◦ Prepare a series of cadmium calibration standards from the
stock solution in a matrix similar to the sample.
◦ Include a blank and at least five standards covering the
expected concentration range of cadmium in the samples.
2. Internal Standards:
◦ Add the internal standard solution to all calibration
standards, quality control samples, and unknown samples to
correct for instrument drift and matrix effects.
3. Instrument Settings:
◦ Optimize ICP-MS settings according to the instrument's
manual, ensuring proper plasma conditions, lens voltage,
and detector parameters.
◦ Tune the instrument using a tuning solution to ensure
optimal sensitivity and stability.
C. Analysis
1. Running Samples:
◦ Begin by running blanks and calibration standards to
construct the calibration curve.
◦ Analyze quality control (QC) samples before and after
running unknown samples to ensure accuracy and
precision.
◦ Introduce prepared blood samples into the ICP-MS in a
sequence that includes QC samples at regular intervals.
2. Data Collection:
◦ Monitor the signals for cadmium and the internal standard.
◦ Accurately quantify cadmium concentrations by comparing
the sample signals to the calibration curve.
D. Quality Control
1. QC Samples:
◦ Use certified reference materials or spiked blood samples
as QC samples.
◦ QC samples should cover the low, medium, and high range
of the calibration curve.
◦ Acceptable precision is within 10% relative standard
deviation (RSD) and accuracy within 10% of the certified
value.
2. Instrument Maintenance:
◦ Perform routine maintenance of the ICP-MS as per the
manufacturer’s guidelines.
◦ Clean the sampling cones and replace perishable parts
regularly to maintain instrument performance.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Data Review:
◦ Review all sample data for QA/QC compliance.
◦ Reanalyze any sample with QC failures or suspected
contamination.
2. Result Interpretation:
◦ Calculate the cadmium concentration in blood by correcting
for dilution factors.
◦ Document any instrument messages or issues in the sample
run log.
3. Documentation:
◦ Record all analytical data, calibration curves, and QC results
in the laboratory’s information system.
4. Report to Clients:
◦ Provide a detailed report including results, method
description, and any comments on sample condition or
analytical anomalies.
◦ Ensure prompt communication of any critical results as
outlined in the laboratory's reporting policy.
