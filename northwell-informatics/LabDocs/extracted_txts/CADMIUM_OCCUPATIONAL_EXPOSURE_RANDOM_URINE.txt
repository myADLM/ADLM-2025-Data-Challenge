Standard Operating Procedure CADMIUM OCCUPATIONAL
EXPOSURE, RANDOM, URINE
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for determining cadmium levels in random
urine samples to assess occupational exposure. This protocol follows
all established guidelines for precision, accuracy, and reliability of
cadmium measurement in urine samples in a CLIA-certified
laboratory.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the trained laboratory personnel to perform
the analysis, document findings accurately, and ensure the
equipment is functioning as per the calibration standards. The
laboratory supervisor is responsible for reviewing the results and
addressing any anomalies.
1. SPECIMEN
Preferred/Acceptable:
• Random urine sample: At least 10 mL of urine collected in a
clean, metal-free container.
Unacceptable:
• Specimens that are not collected in a metal-free container.
• Specimens with visible contaminants, hemolysis, or improper
labeling.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS)
• Metal-free urine collection containers
• Nitric acid (pure for analytical use)
• Calibration standards for Cadmium
• Ultra-pure water
• Pipettes and tips
• Gloves and other necessary personal protective equipment (PPE)
1. PROCEDURE
A) Sample Preparation:
1. Ensure the urine sample is well mixed and homogenous by
gently shaking the container.
2. Transfer 5 mL of urine into a metal-free digestion vessel.
3. Add 1 mL of concentrated nitric acid to the vessel to digest the
sample.
4. Allow to digest at room temperature for a minimum of 30
minutes.
5. Dilute with ultra-pure water to a final volume of 20 mL.
B) Calibration and Quality Control:
1. Prepare a series of cadmium calibration standards using
certified reference materials, diluting in the same matrix as the
prepared urine samples.
2. Run an initial calibration curve on the ICP-MS to ensure
accurate measurement.
3. Include quality control samples with known concentrations of
cadmium along with each batch of patient samples.
C) Analysis:
1. Program the ICP-MS with the specific parameters for cadmium
detection including, but not limited to, nebulizer flow rate,
plasma power, and integration time.
2. Load the prepared digestion vessels into the auto-sampler of
the ICP-MS.
3. Analyze each sample for cadmium concentration, ensuring that
each sample run includes a blank, calibration standards, and
quality controls.
4. Document all raw data including peak area counts and
calculated concentrations.
D) Reporting Results:
1. Compare the cadmium concentrations in the samples to the
calibration curve to ensure sample validity and accuracy.
2. Transmit results to the Laboratory Information System (LIS) and
verify manually.
3. Report results in micrograms per gram creatinine (µg/g
creatinine) for standardization, including results from duplicate
analyses if performed.
E) Quality Control and Maintenance:
1. Perform daily calibration checks and document calibration
status.
2. Include internal controls in each run verifying the accuracy of
each test batch.
3. Follow prescribed maintenance schedule for the ICP-MS
including daily, weekly, and monthly tasks to ensure optimal
functioning.
4. Record and address any instrument issues following the
procedure laid out in the equipment’s operation manual.
F) Handling Abnormal Results:
1. Reanalyze samples if results are above the normal
occupational exposure limit (>5 µg/g creatinine).
2. Notify the laboratory supervisor for verification of reanalysis
results.
3. Implement corrective actions as outlined in the quality
assurance/quality control (QA/QC) plan if discrepancies occur.
4. REFERENCE INTERVALS:
• Reference values for cadmium in urine as per OSHA standards:
Normal range: <2 µg/g creatinine Occupational exposure limit: up
to 5 µg/g creatinine
1. DOCUMENTATION AND REFERENCES:
• Document all findings, including quality control data and
instrument performance, in the laboratory’s record-keeping
system.
• Reference: “OSHA’s Cadmium Regulation 29 CFR 1910.1027,
Occupational Exposure to Cadmium.”
• ISO 15189:2012 and CLIA regulations for quality management
and laboratory practice.
1. REVISION HISTORY:
• Version 1.0: Initial procedure established (October 2023)
• Subsequent revisions as required based on advancements in
technology, changes in regulatory guidelines or optimization of
procedures.
This protocol must be reviewed biennially or as determined by the
laboratory quality assurance committee. Detailed equipment manuals
and manufacturer’s instructions should be followed in parallel to this
protocol to ensure compliance and safety standards are met.
