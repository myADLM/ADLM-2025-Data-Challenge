STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase Protocol for Generating Results for Caffeine,
Serum
1. PURPOSE
This SOP details the steps for the analytical phase of generating
serum caffeine results in a CLIA-certified laboratory.
2. SCOPE
This protocol applies to all trained personnel performing caffeine
analysis on serum specimens using the designated equipment and
consumables.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing the
procedure as outlined, ensuring quality control, and maintaining
accurate records. The supervisor is responsible for addressing any
issues that arise and validating the results before release to
physicians.
4. DEFINITIONS
Caffeine (Serum): The concentration of caffeine present in a patient’s
serum.
5. PROCEDURE
5.1. Specimen Requirements and Stability
• Preferred Specimen: Serum sample collected in a serum
separator tube (SST) or red top tube.
• Stability: Serum specimens are stable for 48 hours at 2–8°C. If
analysis is delayed beyond 48 hours, specimens should be frozen
at -20°C or lower.
5.2. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies
• High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) system
• Caffeine calibration standards
• Mobile phase reagents
• Sample vials
• Micropipettes and tips
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
5.3. Quality Control
• Use two levels of control materials (low and high concentrations)
with known caffeine concentrations.
• Perform QC checks at the beginning of each analytical run, after
every 20th sample, and at the end of the run.
• Acceptable limits for controls from the manufacturer must be
adhered to.
5.4. Detailed Analytical Procedure
1. Sample Preparation
◦ Allow serum specimens to thaw to room temperature if
frozen.
◦ Centrifuge samples at 1,500 g for 10 minutes to ensure
clear, cell-free serum.
◦ Transfer 200 µL of serum to a clean sample vial.
2. HPLC Setup
◦ Prepare the HPLC instrument according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
◦ Equilibrate the column with the mobile phase for at least 30
minutes before injecting samples.
◦ Program the HPLC for appropriate caffeine detection
settings (e.g., wavelength, flow rate).
3. Calibration
◦ Prepare calibration standards of known caffeine
concentrations.
◦ Inject calibration standards into the HPLC system and
create a calibration curve.
◦ Check that the correlation coefficient (r^2) of the calibration
curve is ≥0.99.
4. Sample Analysis
◦ Inject 20 µL of each serum sample into the HPLC system.
◦ Record retention times and peak areas for all samples.
◦ Compare sample retention times and peak areas to
calibration standards to determine caffeine concentrations.
5. Data Recording
◦ Document all results, including calibration, quality control,
and patient sample data.
◦ Ensure data integrity by verifying that the analyte's retention
time matches the standard.
6. Troubleshooting
◦ If abnormalities or inconsistencies are observed in QC
results, do not proceed with sample analysis. Investigate the
issue, correct any problems, and re-run QC before
continuing.
◦ Possible issues include pump malfunctions, column clogs,
or detector issues.
5.5. Reporting Results
• Review all data for accuracy and completeness.
• Validate the results according to laboratory validation protocols.
• Enter validated results into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
• Notify the physician of any critical values following the lab’s critical
results policy.
5.6. Method Limitations
• Hemolyzed or lipemic specimens may interfere with the accuracy
of results.
• Samples not handled or stored properly may yield inaccurate
results.
6. CLEAN-UP AND MAINTENANCE
• Follow manufacturer guidelines for instrument shutdown and
maintenance.
• Dispose of all biohazard waste according to safety protocols.
• Clean and disinfect all work surfaces.
