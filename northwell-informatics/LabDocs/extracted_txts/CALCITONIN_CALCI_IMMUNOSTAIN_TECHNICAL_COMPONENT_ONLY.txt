Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Calcitocin (CALCI)
Immunostain, Technical Component Only
1. PURPOSE
This protocol outlines the procedures for performing the technical
component of calcitonin (CALCI) immunostaining in the laboratory.
The purpose of this immunostain is to detect the presence of
calcitonin, a hormone produced by the thyroid gland, in tissue
samples. The procedure will ensure the accuracy, consistency, and
quality of the immunostaining results.
1. SCOPE
This protocol applies to all staff in the histology lab who are trained
and certified to perform immunohistochemical (IHC) staining
procedures.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated histology laboratory personnel are responsible for
performing, documenting, and reviewing the technical component of
the calcitonin immunostaining process. Supervisors are responsible
for ensuring compliance with this protocol and verifying that staff are
adequately trained.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND HANDLING
• Accepted Specimens: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE)
tissue sections.
• Thickness: Sections should be cut at 4-5 microns thickness.
• Unacceptable Specimens: Specimens that are improperly fixed,
excessively autolyzed, or inadequately processed.
1. REAGENTS AND EQUIPMENT
• Primary Antibody: Anti-Calcitonin monoclonal or polyclonal
antibody (refer to the vendor's datasheet for dilution
recommendations).
• Secondary Antibody: Appropriate secondary antibody conjugated
with enzyme or fluorochrome.
• Detection System: DAB (3,3'-diaminobenzidine) or other
chromogen substrate system.
• Blocking Solution: Normal serum blocking solution or
commercially available protein block.
• Antibody Diluent: As recommended by the antibody manufacturer.
• Automated IHC Stainer (if used).
• Positive Control Tissue: Known calcitonin-producing tissue (e.g.,
medullary thyroid carcinoma).
• Negative Control: Omission of primary antibody on test and
control sections.
• Mounting Medium: Aqueous or permanent mounting medium for
slide coverslipping.
• Microscope: For evaluating stained slides.
1. PROCEDURE
6.1. Preparation of Tissue Sections
• Cut 4-5 micron-thick sections from FFPE tissue blocks.
• Place sections on positively charged glass slides.
• Bake slides in a 60°C oven for 30-60 minutes to ensure adhesion.
6.2. Deparaffinization and Rehydration
• Deparaffinize slides in three changes of xylene, 5 minutes each.
• Rehydrate slides through graded alcohols (100%, 95%, 70%) to
distilled water.
6.3. Antigen Retrieval
• Perform heat-induced epitope retrieval (HIER) using citrate buffer
(pH 6.0) or EDTA buffer (pH 9.0) as recommended by the
antibody manufacturer.
• Heat slides in a microwave or pressure cooker for the
recommended time.
• Allow slides to cool in buffer for 20 minutes at room temperature.
• Rinse slides in distilled water.
6.4. Blocking Endogenous Peroxidase Activity
• Incubate slides in 3% hydrogen peroxide for 10 minutes to
quench endogenous peroxidase activity.
• Rinse in distilled water and wash in phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS) for 5 minutes.
6.5. Primary Antibody Incubation
• Apply the primary antibody diluted in antibody diluent at the
recommended dilution.
• Incubate the slides in a humidified chamber for the time
recommended by the antibody datasheet (usually 30-60 minutes
at room temperature).
• Wash slides in PBS, 3 times for 5 minutes each.
6.6. Secondary Antibody Incubation
• Apply the secondary antibody according to the detection system
protocol.
• Incubate slides in a humidified chamber for 30 minutes at room
temperature.
• Wash slides in PBS, 3 times for 5 minutes each.
6.7. Chromogen Development
• Apply the chromogen solution (e.g., DAB) and incubate for the
time recommended by the manufacturer (usually 3-10 minutes).
• Rinse slides in distilled water to stop the reaction.
6.8. Counterstaining and Mounting
• Counterstain slides with hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes.
• Rinse slides in tap water.
• Dehydrate slides through graded alcohols to xylene.
• Coverslip using an appropriate mounting medium.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run positive and negative controls with each batch of slides.
• Review and document control results to ensure the staining
process was successful.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Document initial observations in the laboratory information system
(LIS).
• Forward slides to a pathologist for interpretation and final
reporting.

secondary antibodies.
