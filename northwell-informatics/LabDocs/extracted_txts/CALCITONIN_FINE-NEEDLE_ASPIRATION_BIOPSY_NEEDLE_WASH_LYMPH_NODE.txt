Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Calcitonin in Fine-Needle Aspiration
Biopsy Needle Wash of Lymph Node
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized protocol for the analysis and reporting of
calcitonin levels in fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) needle wash
specimens of lymph nodes.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all personnel involved in the analytical phase of
measuring calcitonin levels from FNAB needle wash samples
collected from lymph nodes in the laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Designated laboratory technologists are responsible for following
this procedure.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring adherence to this
procedure, conducting reviews, and addressing non-
conformance.
4. DEFINITIONS
• Calcitonin: A hormone secreted by the thyroid gland that is
usually measured as a tumor marker for medullary thyroid
carcinoma.
• Fine-Needle Aspiration Biopsy Needle Wash (FNAB Needle
Wash): A sample collected by rinsing the fine-needle aspiration
biopsy needle in a suitable buffer or saline solution post-
procedure.
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Acceptable Specimen Types:
• FNAB needle wash collected in a sterile container with a
designated buffer or saline solution.
Specimen Stability:
• Store at 2-8°C if processed within 24 hours.
• For longer storage, specimens should be frozen at -20°C or lower.
Unacceptable Specimen Conditions:
• Samples that are visibly contaminated with foreign material.
• Samples received at room temperature more than 4 hours post-
collection without proper refrigeration.
6. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Calcitonin assay reagents and controls
• Micropipettes with tips
• Centrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Laboratory-grade freezer and refrigerator
• Sterile collection containers
• Labeled tubes for aliquots
• Analytical balance (if required for reagent preparation)
• Laboratory Information System (LIS) for recording results
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Use standardized quality control material to ensure assay
performance.
• Run quality control samples in each batch of samples analyzed.
• Document any deviations and corrective actions taken.
8. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Ensure that the specimen aliquot is properly labeled with
patient identification and collection time.
2. Thaw frozen specimens at room temperature or place
refrigerated specimens directly into the analysis workflow.
3. Vortex the sample for 15 seconds to ensure homogeneity.
Centrifugation: 4. Centrifuge the sample at 3000RPM for 10
minutes. Transfer the supernatant into a clean, labeled tube.
Assay Procedure: 5. Set up the calcitonin assay according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. 6. Add appropriate volumes of standards,
controls, and patient samples to designated wells or tubes. 7.
Incubate, wash, and develop the assay as directed by the kit insert.
8. Measure the absorbance or fluorescence (depending on the assay
type) using an appropriate microplate reader or fluorimeter.
Result Calculation: 9. Calculate the sample concentration using the
standard curve generated from the known standards. 10. Ensure that
all control results are within the acceptable range before accepting
the sample results.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
• Enter results into the LIS.
• Verify results, ensuring they fall within the appropriate reference
ranges and flags for any critical values.
• All results must be reviewed and validated by an assigned
technologist before they can be released to physicians.
Reference Intervals:
• Refer to the laboratory’s established reference intervals for
calcitonin.
10. LIMITATIONS
• Hemolysis can interfere with results and should be avoided.
• Ensure proper sample handling to prevent degradation of
calcitonin.
• Use only validated and calibrated equipment for measurement.
11. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s product insert for the specific calcitonin assay kit
used.
• Clinical laboratory management guidelines for calcitonin testing.
12. ATTACHMENTS
• Example of a properly completed laboratory test requisition for
calcitonin.
• Temperature monitoring log template for specimen storage.
13. REVISION HISTORY
• Document any changes made to this SOP with dates and
descriptions of the modifications.
By following this protocol, the laboratory ensures consistent and
accurate measurement of calcitonin in FNAB needle wash samples,
supporting clinical diagnosis and patient care.
