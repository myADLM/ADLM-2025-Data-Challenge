Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analysis of
Calcitonin, Serum
1. PURPOSE
This SOP defines the procedures for the analytical phase for
measuring serum Calcitonin levels in the laboratory. It ensures
consistent, accurate, and reliable results following proper protocols
and method specifications.
RESPONSIBILITY:
It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory technologists to
perform and document the analysis according to this SOP.
Supervisors are responsible for ensuring protocol adherence, quality
control procedures, and validation of results.
1. SPECIMEN COLLECTION
Specimens should already be collected, received, and accessioned
following standard laboratory procedures.
Acceptable Specimens:
• Serum specimens are preferred.
• Specimen should be collected in a red-top tube (no anticoagulant)
or a serum separator tube (SST) containing clot activator.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens received with gross hemolysis.
• Specimens without proper labelling of collection date and time.
• Specimens collected in anticoagulant tubes such as EDTA,
citrate, or heparin.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• Calcitonin assay kits (validated and within expiry date)
• Calibrators and controls specific for the Calcitonin assay.
• Serum separator tubes (SST) or red-top tubes.
• Properly calibrated analytical equipment such as immunoasay
analyzers or specific chemiluminescence immunoassay
analyzers.
• Disposable gloves, pipettes, centrifuges, and storage
refrigerators/freezers.
1. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Ensure the lab bench and equipment are suitably cleaned and
calibrated.
2. Bring all reagents and specimens to room temperature before
performing the test.
Testing:
1. Centrifuge blood sample collected in SST or red-top tubes to
separate the serum.
2. Use the pipette to aliquot the serum into a clean
microcentrifuge tube.
3. Load serum samples, calibrators, and controls into the analyzer
according to the manufacturer's instructions.
4. Follow the step-by-step protocol provided by the assay kit
manufacturer for the detection and measurement of Calcitonin
in serum.
5. Document the sample ID, date, time, operator initials, and any
observations made during the testing process.
Quality Control:
1. Perform quality controls evaluations using known Calcitonin
standards with each batch of analysis.
2. Record quality control results and take corrective action if
controls are out of the acceptable range.
3. Notify the supervisor if repeated QC failures occur.
Troubleshooting:
1. If assay results are inconsistent or out of range:
◦ Verify calibrators and controls are within expiration and
properly prepared.
◦ Recalibrate equipment.
◦ Re-test the sample following a second centrifugal and
aliquoting process.
◦ Document any anomalies and notify supervisor.
2. REPORTING RESULTS
Result Verification:
1. Review assay results before verification in the laboratory
information system (LIS).
2. Results that meet acceptable controls and calibrator ranges will
be transferred to LIS for official reporting.
Critical Value Reporting:
1. Define and document critical Calcitonin values per laboratory
guidelines.
2. Immediately communicate critical results to the requesting
physician following proper documentation policies.
Reference Intervals:
Consult package insert or relevant clinical reference for defined
reference intervals.
Method Limitations: Refer to the specific assay manufacturer's
insert for limitations including:
• Interferences (hemolysis, lipid, icterus)
• Cross-reactivity
• Questionable sample integrity
1. CALIBRATION AND MAINTENANCE
Perform routine calibration of analyzers as recommended by the
manufacturer. Document maintenance procedures, frequency, and
any issues in the equipment maintenance log.
