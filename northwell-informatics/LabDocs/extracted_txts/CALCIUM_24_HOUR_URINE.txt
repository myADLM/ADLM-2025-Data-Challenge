Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Title: Analytical Procedure for
Quantitative Analysis of Calcium in 24-Hour Urine
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized protocol for the quantitative analysis of
calcium in 24-hour urine samples in order to ensure consistent,
accurate, and precise measurements that aid in clinical diagnosis
and treatment.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of trained laboratory personnel to follow this
procedure accurately and to maintain thorough documentation of all
analytical activities. It is also their responsibility to identify and report
any issues affecting the test results to the supervisor immediately.
1. SCOPE
This protocol applies to all laboratory personnel involved in the
analysis of calcium in 24-hour urine samples within the laboratory.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type: 24-hour urine collection.
Storage and Stability:
• Store urine samples at 2-8°C during the collection period.
• After collection, the sample should be submitted to the laboratory
as soon as possible.
• Urine samples can be stable for up to 48 hours when refrigerated.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Incomplete or improperly collected 24-hour urine samples.
• Specimens not kept refrigerated during the collection period.
• Samples contaminated with feces.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
Equipment:
• Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-
OES) or Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry (AAS).
• Centrifuge
• Volumetric flasks
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Urine collection containers
Reagents:
• Calcium standard solutions
• Lanthanum chloride (used to prevent interference from
phosphate)
• Deionized water
• Calibration control materials
1. PROCEDURE
5.1 Preparation
a. Don appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE). b. Verify the
sample is properly labeled with patient's information and collection
time. c. Mix the urine sample well and measure the total volume
using a graduated cylinder.
5.2 Sample Preparation
a. Centrifuge the urine sample at 1500 x g for 10 minutes to remove
any particulates in the sample. b. Aliquot a specific volume of the
clear supernatant into a labeled clean container. c. Dilute the aliquot
with deionized water as appropriate (typically 1:10) and add
lanthanum chloride to a final concentration of 0.1% to prevent
phosphate interference.
5.3 Calibration and Quality Control
a. Calibrate the instrument with calcium standard solutions covering
the expected range of calcium concentrations in urine. b. Run quality
control (QC) samples, both normal and pathological levels, to ensure
the calibration curve is accurate. c. QC results must fall within
acceptable ranges before proceeding with patient samples.
5.4 Analytical Measurement
a. Follow the manufacturer's instructions to set up and operate the
ICP-OES or AAS instrument. b. Aspirate each urine sample, including
the calibration standards and QC samples. c. Record the absorbance
or emission values for calcium.
5.5 Calculation and Reporting
a. Use the calibration curve to calculate the concentration of calcium
in each urine sample. b. Verify that all QC samples fall within the
acceptable ranges. c. Document any deviations or issues. d. Multiply
the measured concentration by the total volume of the 24-hour urine
collection to get the total calcium excreted per day. e. Report the
results in mg/24 hours.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
a. Perform daily instrument calibration and maintenance as
recommended by the instrument manufacturer. b. Analyze QC
samples at the beginning, middle, and end of each analytical run. c.
Maintain documentation of all QC and calibration activities. d. Any
QC failures must be resolved before proceeding with patient sample
analysis.
1. LIMITATIONS
a. Ensure complete collection and correct storage of 24-hour urine
samples to avoid inaccurate results. b. Hemoglobin, proteins, and
other matrix components in the urine can interfere with the results;
appropriate sample preparation steps must be followed meticulously.
c. Ensure that equipment is well maintained and calibrated for
accurate results.
