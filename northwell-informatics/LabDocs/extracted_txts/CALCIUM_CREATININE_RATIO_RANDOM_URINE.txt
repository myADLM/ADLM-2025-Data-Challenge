Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Testing for
Calcium/Creatinine Ratio, Random, Urine
1. PURPOSE
To accurately measure the levels of calcium and creatinine in a
random urine specimen and calculate the calcium/creatinine ratio,
utilizing appropriate laboratory techniques and equipment.
Responsibility:
• Laboratory personnel are responsible for performing the analysis
following the methodology outlined in this procedure.
• Supervisory staff are responsible for reviewing and validating the
results.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred specimen:
• Random urine sample collected in a clean container without any
preservatives.
Acceptable volume:
• Minimum of 10 mL of urine is required to perform the analysis.
Unacceptable specimens:
• Specimens with visible contamination.
• Specimens with insufficient volume.
• Samples older than 24 hours without proper refrigeration at 2°C to
8°C.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Urine calcium reagent kit
• Urine creatinine reagent kit
• Spectrophotometer or automated chemistry analyzer
• Calibrated pipettes and tips
• Centrifuge
• Clean, labeled conical centrifuge tubes
• Deionized water
• Quality control materials (QC)
• Laboratory timer
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
1. PROCEDURE
A) Specimen Preparation:
1. Upon receipt, verify the sample integrity and ensure it meets
the specimen requirements.
2. Mix the urine specimen thoroughly before starting the analysis.
B) Calcium Determination:
1. Pipette the required volume of urine into the reaction cuvette
according to the manufacturer's instructions for the calcium
reagent kit.
2. Add the calcium reagent to the cuvette.
3. Mix thoroughly and incubate for the specific time and
temperature as indicated by the reagent kit instructions.
4. Measure the absorbance or fluorescence using the
spectrophotometer or automated analyzer.
C) Creatinine Determination:
1. Pipette the required volume of urine into a separate reaction
cuvette according to the manufacturer's instructions for the
creatinine reagent kit.
2. Add the creatinine reagent to the cuvette.
3. Mix thoroughly and incubate for the specific time and
temperature as indicated by the reagent kit instructions.
4. Measure the absorbance or fluorescence using the
spectrophotometer or automated analyzer.
D) Calculating the Calcium/Creatinine Ratio:
1. Convert the calcium and creatinine concentrations to the same
units (usually mg/dL or mmol/L).
2. Calculate the ratio using the formula: [ \text{Calcium/Creatinine
Ratio} = \frac{\text{Concentration of Calcium in urine}}
{\text{Concentration of Creatinine in urine}} ]
3. QUALITY CONTROL
A) Daily QC Procedure:
1. Perform quality control with known urine calcium and creatinine
controls before patient samples are tested.
2. Analyze controls following the same method as patient
samples.
3. Document the QC results and ensure they are within
acceptable ranges.
B) Troubleshooting:
1. If QC results fall outside the acceptable range, repeat the
control tests.
2. If QC failure persists, do not proceed with patient sample
testing until the issue is resolved.
3. Investigate potential causes such as reagent or equipment
issues, and take corrective actions.
4. REPORTING RESULTS
5. Review and validate the results obtained from the tests.
6. Report the calcium, creatinine, and calculated calcium/
creatinine ratio in the laboratory information system (LIS).
7. Ensure that the results include appropriate comments if any
issues or observations were noted during testing.
Reference Intervals:
• Calcium/Creatinine Ratio should be referenced against
established normal ranges specific to age and sex, as determined
by laboratory policies.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
2. Hemolysis, high bilirubin levels, or other interfering substances
in urine may affect the accuracy of readings.
3. Ensure proper calibration and maintenance of equipment to
avoid measurement errors.
