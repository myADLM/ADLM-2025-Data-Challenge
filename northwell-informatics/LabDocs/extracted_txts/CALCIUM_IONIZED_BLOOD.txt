Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results: Calcium, Ionized, Blood
1. PURPOSE
This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) provides detailed
instructions for the analysis of ionized calcium in blood specimens,
ensuring accurate and reliable results.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel trained to perform
ionized calcium testing using appropriate blood gas analyzers.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
Laboratory personnel are responsible for adhering to this SOP and
ensuring accurate and precise analytical results. Supervisors are
responsible for training personnel and confirming adherence.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND HANDLING
Specimen Type:
• Preferred: Heparinized whole blood (preferably dry lithium heparin
to avoid dilution).
• Acceptable: Blood gas syringe, SST, or heparinized vacutainer
(dark green or PST). Ensure tubes are completely filled to
maintain anaerobic conditions and suitable heparin concentration.
Collection and Handling:
• Arterial, venous, and capillary specimens are acceptable
depending on the clinical situation.
• Following collection, mix specimens thoroughly to avoid clot
formation.
• Transport specimens to the laboratory immediately.
• Avoid air bubbles and ensure specimens are free of clots.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Sodium citrate, sodium fluoride/oxalate, EDTA specimens.
• Specimens in evacuated blood collection tubes (e.g., Vacutainers
or Microtainers) are not acceptable for blood gas analysis.
• PST specimens should only be used in emergency situations.
• Specimens with significant air bubbles (>10%).
• Specimens with clots or needle attached.
5. REAGENTS AND EQUIPMENT
• Blood Gas Analyzer (e.g., ABL90)
• Heparinized blood gas syringes or heparinized vacutainer tubes
• Calibration and quality control materials (3 levels)
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
6. PROCEDURE
Calibration and Quality Control:
• Perform daily internal QC using three levels of quality control
materials as per manufacturer instructions.
• If QC fails, the instrument will not provide results for the analyte.
Perform a 3-patient comparison with another available analyzer
and validate results.
Specimen Analysis:
1. Upon specimen arrival, verify patient information and specimen
integrity.
2. Mix the specimen thoroughly to ensure homogeneity.
3. Load the specimen into the blood gas analyzer following the
manufacturer’s instructions.
4. Select the appropriate testing profile for ionized calcium.
5. Initiate the analysis.
Result Review and Validation:
1. Review the results on the analyzer display.
2. Verify results within the acceptable reference intervals for
ionized calcium.
Reference Intervals for Ionized Calcium:
• Adults: 1.12 – 1.32 mmol/L
• Pediatric intervals may vary by age group
1. If results are outside the expected range or compromised by
sample integrity issues (e.g., hemolysis):
◦ Centrifuge a small aliquot to check for hemolysis if
hemolysis is suspected.
◦ Technologist to exercise judgment in result reporting.
Reporting Results:
• Results are automatically transmitted to the Laboratory
Information System (LIS) and reviewed by the technologist.
• Critical values (K < 3.0 mmol/L or K ≥ 6.0 mmol/L) must be acted
upon according to laboratory policy.
• Report hemolyzed samples with appropriate comments.
Critical Results Notification:
• Follow the Repeat Critical Values guidelines and call critical
results to the appropriate clinical personnel.
• Document all communications thoroughly.
7. METHOD LIMITATIONS AND TROUBLESHOOTING
• Review the manufacturer’s insert for limitations specific to the
instrument and reagent performance.
• For instrument error messages or unsatisfactory QC performance,
follow troubleshooting steps outlined in the manufacturer’s
manual and notify the supervisor for persistent issues.
8. DOCUMENTATION
• Complete all necessary log sheets for quality control, calibration,
and specimen processing.
• Record all actions taken for out-of-range results or specimen
issues in the laboratory logbook.
