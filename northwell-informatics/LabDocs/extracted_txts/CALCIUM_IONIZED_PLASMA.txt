Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
CALCIUM, IONIZED, PLASMA ANALYSIS
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the analysis of ionized
calcium in plasma using a blood gas analyzer in a CLIA-certified
laboratory.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred Specimens:
• Heparinized whole blood (preferably dry lithium heparin to avoid
dilution) in a blood gas syringe or heparinized vacutainer (dark
green or PST).
• Blood gas syringe containing low concentration or balanced
lithium heparin.
• SST tube must be completely filled to ensure anaerobic
conditions.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Sodium citrate, sodium fluoride/oxalate, EDTA specimens.
• Evacuated blood collection tubes (e.g. Vacutainers or
Microtainers).
• Specimens with needle attached.
• Specimens with significant air contamination (> 10% of specimen
volume).
• Specimens that have clotted.
Transport:
• Specimens must be transported to the lab immediately.
• Acceptable transport methods include pneumatic tube or
transportation worker.
3. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
• Blood gas analyzer (e.g., ABL90)
• Heparinized blood gas syringes or vacutainers (dark green or
PST)
• SST tubes
4. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Preparation:
1. Ensure the blood gas syringe is filled completely.
2. Expel air from the specimen and cap the syringe.
3. Ensure the specimen is mixed thoroughly.
4. Transport the specimen to the laboratory promptly.
B. Instrument Preparation:
1. Ensure the blood gas analyzer is calibrated and quality control
checks are within acceptable limits.
2. Validate the solution pack and sensor cassette as follows:
◦ Perform a 3-patient comparison for new lot numbers
between instruments.
◦ If the same lot number, perform a 1-patient comparison.
◦ Record results in the ABL comparison template.
C. Specimen Analysis:
1. Verify specimen integrity; if in question, centrifuge an aliquot to
check for hemolysis.
2. Load the specimen into the blood gas analyzer.
3. Start the analysis according to manufacturer specifications.
4. Document any instrument error codes or deviations and
reanalyze if necessary.
D. Quality Control:
1. High, medium, and low levels of control materials are analyzed
automatically according to the set schedule.
2. If a control fails, perform a comparison check with another
instrument and record results.
3. If there is a persistent quality control issue, escalate to the on-
call supervisor for direction.
5. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Review and verify results from the blood gas analyzer.
2. Automatically transmit results to the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
3. For critical results (e.g., K < 3.0 mmol/L or K ≥ 6.0 mmol/L),
follow lab policy for reporting and action.
4. For any calculated tests or results outside measurement range
(e.g., PCO2 > 110 mmHg), use appropriate mnemonics to add
comments to the LIS.
5. Document and report any sample integrity issues, hemolysis, or
other abnormalities.

7. QUALITY CONTROL
Refer to the Quality Control section for blood gas procedures. Follow
set schedules and procedures for internal quality controls and
instrument validations.
Reference Intervals:
• Ionized Calcium: Refer to instrument specifications or medical
guidelines.
Method Limitations: Refer to manufacturer’s guidelines and product
insert for specific limitations and troubleshooting.
8. SAFETY AND COMPLIANCE
Follow laboratory safety guidelines and CLIA regulations as
appropriate to ensure specimen integrity and accurate reporting.
By adhering to this SOP, the laboratory ensures standardized,
accurate, and compliant analysis and reporting of ionized calcium in
plasma samples.
