Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Measurement of
Ionized Calcium in Serum
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to ensure the accurate and precise
measurement of ionized calcium (Ca2+) in serum samples using the
Radiometer ABL90 FLEX PLUS analyzer. This procedure is to be
followed for the analytical phase after specimen collection, receipt,
and accessioning.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel who perform ionized
calcium measurements in a CLIA-certified laboratory setting.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of trained laboratory staff to follow this
procedure. Staff are required to ensure quality control, maintenance
of equipment, and accurate reporting of results.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred Specimen:
◦ Serum collected in plain (red-top) tubes or serum separator
(gold-top) tubes.
◦ Specimens must be centrifuged and analyzed immediately to
minimize pH changes that affect ionized calcium levels.
• Unacceptable Specimen:
◦ Uncentrifuged samples.
◦ Serum samples in tubes with additives that interfere with
calcium measurement (e.g., EDTA, citrate, or heparin not
balanced for electrolytes).
5. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Radiometer ABL90 FLEX PLUS analyzer
• Calibrated pH meter (for pH measurement, if necessary)
• Quality control materials (2 levels: Normal and Abnormal)
• Calibration standards (per manufacturer’s guidelines)
• Sample cups and pipettes
• Laboratory personal protective equipment (PPE)
6. PROCEDURE
1. Sample Preparation:
◦ Ensure sample has been properly centrifuged.
◦ Avoid exposure of the sample to air to prevent CO2 loss and
pH changes.
◦ Pipette sample into appropriate sample cup.
2. Instrument Preparation:
◦ Verify the instrument calibration status before use.
◦ Check that quality control results are within acceptable
range. If not, recalibrate and rerun QC.
◦ Load sample into instrument while following the Radiometer
ABL90 FLEX PLUS analyzer instructions.
3. Measurement:
◦ Select the appropriate test (Ionized Calcium, Serum).
◦ Follow prompts on the analyzer to process the sample.
◦ Wait for the instrument to analyze the sample and generate
results.
4. Documentation:
◦ Record the result along with the sample ID, date, and time
in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
◦ Verify the result accuracy before validation.
◦ If result is abnormal, ensure to notify healthcare provider
promptly.
5. Quality Control:
◦ Run two levels of quality control (Normal and Abnormal) at
the beginning of each testing day and after every 10 patient
specimens or when a new reagent lot or significant system
maintenance occurs.
◦ Compare QC results with established ranges and address
any deviations.
6. Maintenance:
◦ Daily: Clean the sample aspirator and replace consumables
as per manufacturer’s guidelines.
◦ Weekly/Monthly: Perform maintenance checks including
system calibration, decontamination, and replacement of the
sensor cassette as needed.
7. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• For ionized calcium in serum: 1.12-1.32 mmol/L
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolysis, lipemia, or icterus can interfere with test results.
• Ensure minimal exposure to air to prevent pH shifts.
• Prompt processing is critical to avoid changes in ionized calcium
due to CO2 loss or cellular metabolism.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
• Confirm that results are within the instrument’s reportable range.
• Critical values should be flagged and reported to the requesting
healthcare provider immediately.
• Reference intervals should be included in the result report for
context.
10. REFERENCES
• Radiometer ABL90 FLEX PLUS operator’s manual.
• Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines.
11. SAFETY AND WASTE DISPOSAL
• Follow all lab safety protocols including PPE usage.
• Dispose of biological samples and other waste materials in
accordance with federal, state, and local regulations.
This protocol ensures that the measurement of ionized calcium in
serum is performed consistently and according to best laboratory
practices, maintaining the reliability of test results and patient care
outcomes.
