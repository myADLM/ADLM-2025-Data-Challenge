Calcium, Random, Urine - Analytical Phase SOP
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the accurate analysis and
reporting of calcium levels in random urine specimens.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel responsible for
performing calcium analysis on random urine specimens in the
clinical laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• All laboratory technologists and medical laboratory scientists are
responsible for performing and documenting the analysis in
accordance with this SOP.
• It is the responsibility of the laboratory supervisor to ensure that
all personnel are trained and proficient in this procedure.
4. DEFINITIONS
• Calcium, Random, Urine: Measurement of calcium excreted in
urine collected randomly without any specific preparatory
protocols.
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Acceptable Specimens:
• Freshly voided random urine sample collected in a clean, sterile
container.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Urine samples contaminated by feces or toilet paper.
• Specimens not properly labeled with patient information,
collection date, and time.
• Specimens containing preservatives other than required or
expected (might interfere with analysis).
Volume: 10 mL of urine is preferred.
Storage:
• Specimens should be analyzed immediately when possible.
• If not possible, specimens may be stored at 2-8°C for up to 24
hours.
6. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
Equipment:
• Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) or
Atomic Absorption Spectrometer (AAS).
• Centrifuge.
• Volumetric pipettes.
• Urine cups.
Reagents:
• Calcium standard solutions.
• Matrix solution (if required for ICP-MS).
• Quality control materials (low, medium, high)
7. PROCEDURE
Specimen Preparation:
1. Mix the urine sample thoroughly by gentle inversion.
2. Aliquot 5 mL of the urine sample into a centrifuge tube.
3. Centrifuge the urine sample at 3,000 RPM for 10 minutes to
remove any particulate matter.
4. Transfer the supernatant to a clean processing tube and
proceed with analysis.
Calibration:
1. Prepare calibration standards according to instrument and
manufacturer protocols.
2. Perform a calibration verification using control materials to
ensure the calibration curve is accurate.
Analysis:
1. Ensure the instrument is properly calibrated and ready for use.
2. Load the quality control samples and patient specimens onto
the instrument.
3. Input the necessary patient and sample information in the
system.
4. Select the appropriate method/protocol for calcium analysis.
5. Start the analysis cycle.
6. Monitor the instrument readings and ensure quality control
results fall within acceptable ranges before proceeding with
patient samples.
Quality Control:
1. Run quality control materials at the beginning of each batch
analysis to ensure accuracy and precision.
2. Acceptable limits for QC material should be predetermined and
documented.
3. If QC samples are outside of acceptable limits, investigate and
resolve the issues before analyzing patient samples.
Results Reporting:
1. Review the results generated by the instrument for any flags or
errors.
2. Verify the data entry and ensure proper documentation in the
Laboratory Information System (LIS).
3. Validate the results by following laboratory reporting guidelines.
4. Critical values should be repeated if necessary and promptly
communicated to the appropriate healthcare provider.
8. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Determine reference intervals based on the laboratory's
standardized range or clinical guidelines.
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Ensure specimen is free from contamination and has no
interfering substances.
• Follow instrument specific limitations as outlined by the
manufacturer.
10. REFERENCES
• Instrument manufacturer’s manual for ICP-MS or AAS.
• Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines.
• Current literature on urine calcium analysis methods.
Each procedure within the laboratory must be tailored to meet the
specific requirements of the instrument and reagents used in your
facility. Regular review and updates to the SOP are recommended to
ensure compliance with the latest standards and technological
advancements.
