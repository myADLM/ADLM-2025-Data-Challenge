Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analysis of Total
Calcium in Plasma
1. Purpose
The purpose of this procedure is to detail the steps required to
accurately analyze total calcium levels in plasma specimens. The
protocol encompasses specimen handling, equipment usage,
reagents, the method of analysis, quality control, and reporting
results to ensure precision, accuracy, and reliability in the
determination of total plasma calcium.
1. Responsibility
It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory personnel to follow
this SOP precisely and to ensure that all specimens are handled,
analyzed, and reported according to the procedure. All laboratory
staff involved in the analytical process must be adequately trained
and proficient in the techniques described.
1. Specimen Requirements and Stability
• Specimen Type: Plasma collected in lithium heparin or SST
(Serum Separator Tube).
• Volume: Preferred volume of 2-3mL.
• Handling: Ensure that specimens do not come into contact with
air by properly capping tubes.
• Stability:
◦ Plasma specimens are stable for up to 48 hours when stored
at 2-8°C.
◦ Hemolyzed or improperly stored specimens are unacceptable.
1. Equipment and Supplies
• Blood collection tubes (Lithium heparin/SST).
• Centrifuge, capable of achieving 3000 rpm.
• Calcium analysis kit, suitable for the chemistry analyzer in use
(e.g., Roche Cobas Calcium Assay).
• Chemistry Analyzer (e.g., Roche Cobas System).
• Calibrated pipettes.
• Quality control materials (high, medium, and low level).
1. Reagents
Ensure all reagents are within expiration date and stored as
recommended by the manufacturer:
• Calcium reagent (ready-to-use).
• Calibrator(s) specific to the calcium assay.
• Quality Control materials.
1. Procedure
A) Specimen Preparation
• Centrifuge the plasma collection tubes at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes
to separate plasma from cells.
• Transfer the clear plasma to a clean, appropriately labeled tube.
B) Analyzer Preparation
• Turn on the chemistry analyzer and allow it to warm up as per the
manufacturer’s instructions.
• Load the calcium reagent kit onto the analyzer.
• Perform a daily maintenance check on the analyzer (cleaning,
calibration).
C) Calibration
• Run the calibration standards to calibrate the analyzer for total
calcium measurement as per the manufacturer’s instructions.
• Accept calibration only when all calibration criteria (accuracy,
precision) have been met.
D) Quality Control
• Analyze quality control samples (low, medium, high) before
running patient samples.
• Verify that QC results fall within acceptable ranges. If not,
investigate, resolve issues, and re-calibrate if necessary.
E) Sample Analysis
• Program the analyzer for the total calcium assay.
• Load patient plasma specimens onto the analyzer.
• Start the analysis according to the standard operating procedure
for the given analyzer.
• The analyzer will automatically aspirate the sample, mix it with
reagent, and measure the total calcium concentration.
1. Result Interpretation and Reporting
• Results will automatically be transmitted to the Laboratory
Information System (LIS) after analysis.
• Review results for any flags or error messages. Reanalyze any
flagged specimens.
• Verify and validate the results through the LIS before reporting.
• If any critical values are obtained, follow the laboratory’s protocol
for notification and documentation.
1. Quality Control and Maintenance
• Conduct daily, weekly, and monthly maintenance of the analyzer
as per the manufacturer’s guidelines.
• Keep thorough records of all QC and maintenance activities.
• Investigate all QC failures, recalibrate analyzers if required, and
document corrective actions.
1. Critical Results
• Total calcium levels below 2.0 mmol/L or above 3.0 mmol/L are
considered critical and must be immediately reported to the
ordering physician or healthcare provider.
• Document the notification of critical results meticulously, including
date, time, and person contacted.
1. Method Limitations
• Hemolysis, lipemia, and icterus can interfere with total calcium
measurement. Hemolyzed specimens should be rejected.
• Ensure specimens are free of air contamination to maintain
accuracy.

Disclaimer: This protocol is to be followed exactly as stated.
Deviations or protocol amendments must be approved by the
laboratory supervisor or director.
By ensuring all details and steps are comprehensively documented
and adhered to, the laboratory can maintain the integrity and
accuracy of total calcium testing in plasma specimens.
