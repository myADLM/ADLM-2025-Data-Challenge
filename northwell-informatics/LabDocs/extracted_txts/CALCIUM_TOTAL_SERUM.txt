Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) for CALCIUM,
TOTAL, SERUM Analysis
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to provide a standardized procedure for
the quantitative determination of total calcium in serum using
photometric analysis. This procedure utilizes automated biochemistry
analyzers to ensure accuracy, precision, and reliable results for
patient diagnosis and management.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for adhering to this SOP,
ensuring that all steps are followed meticulously to produce accurate
results. Supervisors are responsible for verifying the procedure has
been followed correctly and taking action if deviations occur.
3. DEFINITION
Total Calcium (Ca) in serum is a measurement of the amount of
calcium that is bound to proteins as well as free (ionized) calcium,
which plays critical roles in biological processes such as bone
formation, muscle contraction, and nerve function.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
4.1 Specimen Collection:
• Preferred Specimen: 5 mL of venous blood collected in a serum
separator tube (SST).
• Acceptable Specimen: Venous blood collected in a clot activator
tube.
4.2 Specimen Handling:
• Allow the blood to clot for 30 minutes at room temperature before
centrifugation.
• Centrifuge specimen at 1500-2000 g for 10 minutes.
• Separate serum from the cells promptly to avoid hemolysis and
other interferences.
4.3 Specimen Stability:
• Serum should be analyzed within 48 hours of collection if stored
at 2-8°C.
• For long-term storage, serum can be frozen at -20°C for up to 6
months.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
5.1 Equipment:
• Automated Biochemistry Analyzer (e.g., Roche Cobas c 501 or
Siemens Dimension RxL Max)
• Centrifuge
• Refrigerator/Freezer
5.2 Reagents:
• Manufacturer's Calcium reagent kit compatible with the analyzer
in use.
• Calibrators and controls specific to Calcium.
5.3 Supplies:
• Serum separator tubes (SST)
• Pipettes and tips
• Specimen cups
• Quality control materials
6. PROCEDURE
6.1 Calibration:
• Perform calibration using the manufacturer's specific calibrators
before running patient samples.
• Calibrate according to the analyzer's instructions and confirmation
of successful calibration.
6.2 Quality Control:
• Run two levels of quality control (QC) material at the start of each
shift and after every reagent change.
• Document QC results and ensure they fall within acceptable
ranges specified by the manufacturer. If QC is out of range,
troubleshoot and resolve before proceeding.
6.3 Sample Preparation:
• Allow stored serum specimens to reach room temperature.
• Inspect serum for hemolysis, lipemia, and icterus. Reject any
specimens that show significant interference.
6.4 Analysis:
• Load patient specimens onto the biochemistry analyzer according
to the instrument's specifications.
• Follow the analyzer's specific instructions for running the Calcium
assay.
• Monitor the analyzer for any error messages and resolve issues
promptly.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
7.1 Reference Intervals:
• Normal range for serum calcium: 8.5-10.2 mg/dL (2.12-2.55
mmol/L)
7.2 Result Verification:
• Review all results generated by the analyzer.
• Verify flagged results or those outside the reference interval by
repeat analysis.
• Document all findings and review for consistency.
7.3 Critical Results:
• Critical values (below 7.0 mg/dL or above 12.0 mg/dL) must be
immediately communicated to the responsible healthcare provider
according to the laboratory's critical results policy.
• Document all critical value communications.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
8.1 Interferences:
• Hemolysis, lipemia, and icterus can potentially interfere with the
photometric analysis. Assess specimen quality before analysis.
• Ensure troubleshooting steps for resolving interferences are
followed according to the manual.
8.2 Calibration and Instrumentation:
• Calibration must be performed per the manufacturer’s guidelines
and should be validated periodically to prevent any deviation in
accuracy.
