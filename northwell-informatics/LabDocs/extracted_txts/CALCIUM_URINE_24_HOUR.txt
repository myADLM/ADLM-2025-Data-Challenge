CALCIUM, URINE, 24 HOUR ANALYTICAL PROTOCOL
1. PURPOSE
This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) describes the process for
analyzing 24-hour urine specimens for calcium concentration. It
ensures accurate, consistent, and reproducible results essential for
patient diagnosis and monitoring.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND HANDLING
Specimen:
• Preferred/acceptable: 24-hour urine collection. Specimens
should be collected in a container with no preservative. Ensure
proper mixing and refrigerator at 2-8°C until analysis.
Unacceptable:
• Specimens without complete 24-hour collection data.
• Urine specimens not stored correctly, leading to precipitation or
microbial growth.
• Specimens with contamination or visible debris.
• Non-refrigerated specimens for more than 24 hours post-
collection.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Automated chemistry analyzer (e.g., Roche Cobas c311 or
equivalent)
• Calcium reagent kit, as per manufacturer’s guidelines
• Deionized water
• Sample cups
• Calibrators and controls specific to urinary calcium analysis
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
1. ANALYTICAL PROCEDURE
Preparation:
• Ensure sample has been mixed thoroughly.
• Bring refrigerated specimen to room temperature before analysis.
• Prepare necessary reagents, calibrators, and controls according
to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Calcium Analysis:
1. Calibrator and QC Verification: a. Run calibrators according
to the instrument's protocol and verify that the calibration curve
meets the acceptable criteria. b. Run quality control (QC)
materials at the beginning of the analytical run, after calibration,
and at intervals recommended by the manufacturer to ensure
assay integrity.
2. Specimen Analysis: a. Pour the urine sample into sample
cups, adequately labeled. b. Load the specimen onto the
automated chemistry analyzer following the instrument’s
protocol. c. Input necessary data for each specimen, including
patient identifier and unique specimen accession number.
3. Run Analytical Assay: a. Initiate the analysis per the
instrument manufacturer’s instructions. b. The analyzer
measures the calcium concentration in the urine specimen. c.
Monitor the run for any instrument flags or errors.
Post Analysis:
• Review raw data and statistical parameters.
• Verify that control results are within the pre-defined acceptable
range.
• If QC fails, reanalyze the QC and take corrective actions as
necessary before repeating patient samples.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results are automatically transmitted to the Laboratory
Information System (LIS) from the instrument.
• Technologist reviews and verifies results prior to release.
• Interpretive comments, if applicable, should be documented in the
patient’s report.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
Materials:
• Commercially available urine-based QC materials, negative and
positive controls.
Procedure:
• Run controls according to a predetermined schedule (daily or per
batch as appropriate).
• Record all control results in the QC log.
• Investigate and document any deviations or out-of-control
occurrences, and take necessary corrective actions.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Calcium concentration in 24-hour urine:
◦ Adult Male: 50-300 mg/24 hr
◦ Adult Female: 50-250 mg/24 hr
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemoglobin, bilirubin, or certain drugs in urine may interfere with
calcium measurements.
• Extremely high or low pH, significant proteinuria, or incomplete
collections may affect results.

incorporate any advancements in technology, reagent updates, new
clinical guidelines, or changes in regulatory requirements.
