1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this protocol is to establish clear, standardized
procedures for generating results for Calcium, Urine, Random. This
protocol ensures that accurate, reliable, and timely results are
produced in compliance with the Clinical Laboratory Improvement
Amendments (CLIA) regulations.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen Type:
• Random urine sample, preferably the first morning void.
Acceptable Containers:
• Standard urine collection container (clean and dry).
Minimum Volume:
• At least 10 mL of urine.
Storage and Stability:
• Store the sample at 2-8°C if not analyzed immediately.
• Sample stable for up to 24 hours when refrigerated.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens with insufficient volume.
• Specimens with visible contamination or foreign substances.
• Specimens not properly labeled with patient ID, date, and time of
collection.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Ion-selective electrode analyzer (automated chemistry analyzer).
• Centrifuge.
Reagents:
• Calcium reagent set (refer to manufacturer’s instructions).
• Quality control materials specific for urinary calcium analysis.
Supplies:
• Calibrated pipettes.
• Disposable pipette tips.
• Urine collection containers.
• Gloves and other personal protective equipment (PPE).
4. PROCEDURE
1. Specimen Preparation:
◦ Ensure the specimen is at room temperature.
◦ Mix the urine sample well before aliquoting.
2. Centrifugation:
◦ Centrifuge the urine sample at 1500 x g for 10 minutes to
remove particulates.
◦ Use the supernatant for analysis.
3. Calibrate the Analyzer:
◦ Follow the manufacturer’s instructions to calibrate the
analyzer before running the test.
4. Sample Analysis:
◦ Set up the analyzer according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
◦ Pipette the required volume of the urinary supernatant into
the designated sample cup or position.
◦ Load the sample into the analyzer.
◦ Run the sample in the analyzer to measure the
concentration of calcium.
5. Quality Control:
◦ Ensure that the quality control materials (negative and
positive controls) are run at the beginning of each shift and
after any troubleshooting actions.
◦ Evaluate the quality control results to ensure they are within
the acceptable range before reporting patient results.
◦ If controls do not meet criteria, do not report any patient
results until the issue is resolved.
5. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results will be reported in mg/dL or mmol/L, depending on the
laboratory’s standard unit for reporting.
• Ensure results are reviewed and verified by the technologist
before releasing.
• Record the verified results in the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
6. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Reference intervals may vary based on patient population,
laboratory standards, and guidelines. Common reference intervals
for random urine calcium concentrations in adults are typically < 4
mg/dL or < 0.1 mmol/L. Always consult your lab’s historical data or
guidelines.
7. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Ensure proper sample collection and handling to avoid
contamination or degradation that could affect calcium
measurements.
• Hematuria or turbidity in the sample may increase analytical
variability.
• Always refer to the manufacturer’s instructions for detailed
information on analyzer performance and limitations.
8. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If an analyzer error occurs, consult the manufacturer’s
troubleshooting guide.
• Re-run controls and patient samples after resolving any identified
issues.
• If sample integrity is in question (e.g., hemolyzed, contaminated),
request a new specimen.
9. QUALITY ASSURANCE
• Regularly review quality control and patient results for trends and
inconsistencies.
• Participate in external proficiency testing programs to ensure
accuracy.
• Maintain up-to-date training for all personnel involved in
performing the assay.
