Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analysis of Calcium in
Timed Urine Specimen
1. PURPOSE
To outline a detailed procedure for the quantitative determination of
calcium in timed urine specimens in order to ensure accuracy,
precision, and reliability of test results.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to the biochemical analysis of timed urine
specimens for calcium concentration within the clinical laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of trained laboratory personnel to perform the
procedure as outlined and ensure all quality control measures and
documentation are followed.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND PREPARATION
Preferred Specimen:
• A 24-hour timed urine collection, properly labeled with collection
start and end times.
• Specimens should be collected in a clean, dry container with no
preservatives unless specified by protocol.
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Specimens missing collection start/end times.
• Contaminated, improperly collected, or improperly labeled
specimens.
• Specimens not refrigerated or delivered within 24 hours post-
collection.
Preparation:
• Mix the collected urine thoroughly before aliquoting to ensure
homogeneity.
• Measure and record the total volume of the collected urine.
• Aliquot the urine into a sterile, appropriately labeled container for
analysis.
5. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
Equipment:
• Centrifuge (if clarification of urine is required)
• Calibrated analytical balance
• Automated urine chemistry analyzer or manual
spectrophotometer
• Pipettes and tips
• Vortex mixer
Reagents:
• Calcium reagent kit (as per manufacturer’s instructions)
• Quality control materials for calcium (low, medium, and high
levels)
• Deionized water
6. PROCEDURE
1. Specimen Preparation:
◦ If the urine is cloudy, centrifuge at 1500 rpm for 10 minutes.
◦ Carefully decant the clear supernatant into a clean
container.
2. Calibration:
◦ Calibrate the urine analyzer or spectrophotometer as per
manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Record calibration data.
3. Quality Control:
◦ Run QC samples (low, medium, high) prior to patient sample
analysis.
◦ Ensure QC values fall within specified ranges before
proceeding.
◦ Record QC data.
4. Sample Analysis:
◦ Pipette the required volume of urine specimen into the
analyzer or prepare the sample as directed for manual
analysis.
◦ For manual analysis, follow the reagent kit instructions for
reaction setup, timing, and colorimetric measurement.
◦ Analyze the sample using appropriate settings on the
analyzer or spectrophotometer.
◦ Record all generated data.
5. Calculation:
◦ For timed urine collections (24-hour), calculate the total
calcium excretion as follows:
▪ ( \text{Calcium concentration (mg/L)} \times \text{Total
urine volume (L)} = \text{Total calcium (mg/day)} )
7. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results are documented in the laboratory information system
(LIS).
• Units of measure for urine calcium should be mg/day.
• Reference range for urine calcium should be included in the
report (typically 100-300 mg/day).
• Ensure all critical results are reported as per laboratory protocol.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform QC for each analytical run as specified by the reagent
manufacturer.
• Record QC results in the QC log.
• Investigate and resolve any QC failures before patient sample
analysis.
• Participate in external quality assessment schemes where
available.
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Interferences may occur from high levels of oxalates, phosphates,
or magnesium.
• Utilize clear urine specimens for optimal accuracy.
• Refer to the reagent insert for specific limitations related to the
assay.
10. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions for calcium reagent kits.
• Urine Chemistry Analyzer Operating Manual.
• Laboratory quality manual.
11. DOCUMENTATION
• All steps and observations must be documented in the
laboratory’s Quality Management System.
• Record any procedural deviations or anomalies encountered
during analysis.
