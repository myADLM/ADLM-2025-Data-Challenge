Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for CALDESMON
IMMUNOSTAIN, TECHNICAL COMPONENT ONLY
1. PURPOSE: The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedure
for generating results for Caldesmon immunostain, focusing on
the technical component, to ensure consistent and accurate
immunohistochemical staining in a CLIA-certified laboratory.
Responsibility:
• Designated Histotechnologists are responsible for performing the
staining procedure following this SOP.
• It is the responsibility of laboratory supervisors to ensure
compliance with this SOP and address any issues that arise
during the staining process.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS:
• Preferred specimen: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE)
tissue sections.
• Tissue sections must be cut at 4 micrometers (µm) thickness.
• Sections must be placed on positively charged glass slides.
1. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES:
• Caldesmon primary antibody (validated lot, stored according to
manufacturer’s instructions).
• Secondary antibody detection system (as specified in the
standard immunohistochemistry protocol).
• Appropriate positive and negative control tissues.
• Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) stains.
• Xylene, ethanol, and distilled water.
• Automated immunostainer (if available) or manual staining setup.
• Mounting medium and coverslips.
1. EQUIPMENT:
• Microtome.
• Water bath.
• Incubator (for antigen retrieval if required).
• Automated immunostainer (if available).
• Slide oven or dryer.
• Light microscope.
1. PROCEDURE:
A) Preparation of Slides:
1. Section FFPE blocks at 4 µm thickness using a microtome.
2. Float tissue sections on a water bath set at an appropriate
temperature.
3. Transfer tissue sections to positively charged glass slides and
allow to dry at room temperature.
4. Bake slides at 58-60°C for 1 hour to ensure adhesion.
B) Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
1. Deparaffinize slides by placing them in xylene for three 5-
minute intervals.
2. Rehydrate slides through a series of graded ethanol solutions
(100%, 95%, 80%, 70%) for 3 minutes each.
3. Rinse slides in distilled water for 3 minutes.
C) Antigen Retrieval (optional and protocol dependent):
1. Perform antigen retrieval using the appropriate method as
specified by the primary antibody manufacturer (e.g., heat-
induced epitope retrieval in citrate buffer, pH 6.0).
2. Allow slides to cool to room temperature and rinse in distilled
water.
D) Immunostaining:
1. Block endogenous peroxidase activity by incubating slides in
3% hydrogen peroxide solution for 10 minutes.
2. Rinse slides in distilled water and transfer to buffer (e.g., PBS
or TBS).
3. Apply the caldesmon primary antibody to the slides, ensuring
even coverage of the tissue sections.
4. Incubate slides in a humidified chamber for the time specified
by the antibody manufacturer (typically 30-60 minutes).
5. Wash slides in buffer to remove excess primary antibody.
6. Apply secondary antibody detection system according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
7. Incubate slides in a humidified chamber for the time specified
(typically 30-60 minutes).
8. Wash slides in buffer.
E) Chromogen Development:
1. Apply the chromogen substrate solution to the slides.
2. Incubate for the specified time while monitoring the
development under the microscope.
3. Stop the reaction by rinsing slides in distilled water.
F) Counterstaining:
1. Counterstain slides with hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes.
2. Rinse slides in distilled water.
3. Differentiate in acid alcohol if needed and rinse in tap water.
4. Bluing step in 0.1% sodium bicarbonate solution and rinse in
tap water.
G) Dehydration and Mounting:
1. Dehydrate slides through a graded series of ethanol solutions
(70%, 80%, 95%, 100%).
2. Clear slides in xylene (three changes, 5 minutes each).
3. Mount sections using mounting medium and coverslips.
H) Quality Control:
1. Include appropriate positive and negative control slides with
each batch of staining.
2. Document all staining procedures, including any deviations, in
the laboratory log.
3. Examine slides under a microscope to ensure optimal staining
quality.
4. DOCUMENTATION AND REPORTING:
• Record the date, time, lot numbers of reagents, and initials of the
technologist performing the staining.
• Review and record the observations of both, control and patient
slides.
• Document any issues encountered and corrective actions taken.
1. REFERENCES:
• Manufacturer's instructions for Caldesmon primary antibody and
detection system.
• CLIA regulations and immunohistochemistry guidelines.
• Laboratory internal quality control and assurance protocols.
1. APPROVAL AND REVIEW:
• This SOP is subject to approval by the Laboratory Director and
shall be reviewed annually or as necessary.
By implementing this SOP, we ensure the reliability and accuracy of
Caldesmon immunostain results, thereby maintaining high standards
of laboratory performance.
