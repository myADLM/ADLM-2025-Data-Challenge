Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) for CALIFORNIA VIRUS
(LA CROSSE) ENCEPHALITIS ANTIBODY PANEL, IGG AND IGM,
SPINAL FLUID
1. PURPOSE
This procedure outlines the steps for the analytical phase of testing
California Virus (La Crosse) Encephalitis Antibodies (IgG and IgM) in
spinal fluid to ensure accurate and reliable results.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to authorized personnel performing testing on
collected spinal fluid samples using ELISA methodology.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of qualified laboratory personnel to perform and
document all steps of the testing procedure accurately and to ensure
quality control measures are followed and results are validated
before reporting.
4. REAGENTS, SUPPLIES, AND EQUIPMENT
• California (La Crosse) Virus Encephalitis Antibody ELISA Kits (IgG
and IgM)
• Micropipettes and tips
• Plate reader
• Incubator set to 37°C
• Washing buffer
• Dilution buffer
• Substrate solution
• Stop solution
• Calibration Standards
• Controls (Positive and Negative)
• Spinal Fluid Samples
5. SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS
• Follow standard laboratory safety guidelines.
• Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE).
• Handle all samples and reagents as potential biohazards.
• Dispose of waste according to biomedical waste disposal
regulations.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run positive and negative controls with each batch of tests.
• Ensure calibration standards are within acceptable range.
• Document results of controls in the Quality Control log.
• If controls are out of range, troubleshoot, and repeat the assay
before proceeding with testing.
7. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation
1. Allow all reagents and samples to reach room temperature
before starting the test.
2. Label ELISA strips or plates for IgG and IgM testing.
B. Sample Dilution
1. Dilute spinal fluid samples 1:100 with dilution buffer.
2. Mix gently to avoid bubble formation.
C. Assay Procedure - IgG and IgM
1. Add 100 µL of diluted sample, controls, and standards to the
appropriate wells.
2. Incubate the plate at 37°C for 1 hour.
3. Aspirate the contents and wash the wells 3-4 times with
washing buffer.
4. Add 100 µL of enzyme conjugate to each well.
5. Incubate the plate at 37°C for 30-60 minutes.
6. Aspirate and wash wells 3-4 times with washing buffer.
7. Add 100 µL of substrate solution to each well.
8. Incubate the plate in the dark at room temperature for 10-15
minutes.
9. Add 100 µL of stop solution to each well to stop the reaction.
D. Measurement and Interpretation
1. Measure the optical density (OD) of each well at 450 nm using
a plate reader.
2. Calculate the mean OD value for controls and samples.
3. Compare OD values of samples to the standard curve to
determine antibody concentration.
4. Interpret results per the manufacturer's guidelines.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Document all raw data, including control and standard values.
2. Verify and validate results by comparing with quality control
data.
3. Report results according to predefined reference intervals and
criteria.
9. LIMITATIONS
1. Results should be interpreted in the context of other clinical and
laboratory findings.
2. Non-specific reactions or cross-reactivity with other viral
antibodies can occur.
3. Follow manufacturer's guidelines for any specific assay
limitations.

Note: This protocol must be reviewed and updated periodically to
comply with changes in regulatory requirements, guidelines, or new
research findings. All deviations or incidents that occur during testing
should be documented and reviewed by the supervisory personnel.
