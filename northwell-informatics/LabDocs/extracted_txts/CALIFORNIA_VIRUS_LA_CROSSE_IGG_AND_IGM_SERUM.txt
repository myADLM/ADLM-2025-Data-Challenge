CALIFORNIA VIRUS (LA CROSSE) IGG AND IGM, SERUM
ANALYTICAL PHASE PROTOCOL
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standard procedure for the analysis and generation of
results for California Virus (La Crosse) IgG and IgM antibodies in
serum samples.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel responsible for the
analysis of California Virus (La Crosse) IgG and IgM in serum
samples using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of designated laboratory personnel to perform
the procedure accurately and ensure the results generated are
accurate and reliable.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Microplate reader capable of measuring absorbance at 450 nm
and 620-650 nm.
• Incubator set at 37°C.
• Microplate washing system.
• Pipettes (single and multi-channel).
• Timer.
• California Virus (La Crosse) IgG and IgM ELISA kits.
• Calibrators and controls.
• Serum samples.
• Absorbent paper.
• ELISA microplates.
• Distilled or deionized water.
5. PROCEDURE
5.1 Preparation:
1. Allow reagents, calibrators, controls, and serum samples to
reach room temperature (18-25°C) before use.
2. Mix all reagents gently without creating foam.
3. Label the microplate wells to identify each sample, control, and
calibrator.
5.2 Sample and Reagent Preparation:
1. Prepare the Microplate:
• Designate wells for calibrators, controls, and serum samples.
• Include at least two wells for each calibrator (high, low) and
control (positive, negative).
1. Prepare the Wash Buffer:
• Dilute the 20x wash buffer concentrate with distilled or deionized
water according to the manufacturer's instructions.
5.3 Assay Procedure:
1. Serum Samples, Controls, and Calibrators:
• Pipette the calibrators, controls, and serum samples (100 µL
each) into their designated wells.
• Incubate the microplate at 37°C for 30 minutes.
1. Washing:
• Wash the microplate wells with the prepared wash buffer at least
5 times (use a microplate washing system or manual washing).
1. Enzyme Conjugate:
• Add 100 µL of the enzyme conjugate into each well.
• Incubate the microplate at 37°C for another 30 minutes.
1. Washing:
• Repeat the washing steps (same as in 2).
1. Substrate Solution:
• Add 100 µL of the substrate solution into each well.
• Incubate the microplate at room temperature (18-25°C) for 15
minutes in the dark.
1. Stopping Solution:
• Add 100 µL of the stopping solution into each well to stop the
reaction.
5.4 Data Collection:
1. Measure Absorbance:
• Measure the absorbance of each well at 450 nm with a reference
wavelength of 620-650 nm using a microplate reader.
1. Result Calculation:
• Calculate the mean absorbance for each calibrator, control, and
unknown sample.
• Plot a standard curve using the absorbance values of the
calibrators.
• Determine the concentration of IgG and IgM in the serum samples
by comparing the sample absorbance to the standard curve.
5.5 Quality Control:
1. Controls:
• Run positive and negative controls with each batch of samples to
ensure assay performance.
• Ensure that control values fall within the acceptable range
provided in the kit insert.
1. Calibration:
• Use at least two calibration points to confirm the validity of the
standard curve.
1. Troubleshooting:
• If controls do not fall within the expected range, recheck reagents,
equipment, and procedure execution. Repeat the assay if
necessary.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Result Interpretation:
• Positive IgG and/or IgM results suggest current or previous
exposure to California Virus (La Crosse).
• Negative results suggest no detectable antibodies to California
Virus (La Crosse).
1. Documentation:
• Record all assay results including controls and calibrators.
• Ensure proper documentation of results in the Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
7. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• IgG: Negative (no detectable IgG).
• IgM: Negative (no detectable IgM).
8. LIMITATIONS
• Hemolysis, lipemia, or bacterial contamination of the specimen
may affect the assay results.
• Results should be used in conjunction with clinical findings and
other diagnostic procedures.

equipment used in this procedure.
10. REVIEW AND REVISION
• This protocol will be reviewed annually or as needed based on
new regulations, guidelines, or advancements in methodology.
This SOP provides clarity and consistency in testing for California
Virus (La Crosse) IgG and IgM in serum samples ensuring accurate
and reliable test results.
