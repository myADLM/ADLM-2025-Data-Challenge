Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this SOP is to outline the protocol
for the analytical phase of generating results for Calmodulin-
binding transcription activator 1 (CAMTA1) by immunostain,
technical component only. This protocol ensures consistent and
accurate results by following standardized procedures for
specimen preparation, staining, and analysis.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory staff are responsible for
performing the CAMTA1 immunostain procedure and documenting
the results according to this SOP. All laboratory personnel must
ensure that the protocol is followed meticulously and promptly
address any identified issues.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS Preferred Specimen: - Formalin-
fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections. - Unstained tissue
sections on positively charged slides.
Specimen Handling: - Ensure specimens are properly
accessioned. - Verify patient identification and labeling.
2. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS Equipment: - Microtome - Slide
warmer - Immunostaining platform (manual or automated) -
Light microscope
Reagents: - Primary antibody: Anti-CAMTA1 - Secondary
antibody: HRP-conjugated secondary antibody - Chromogen:
DAB (Diaminobenzidine) - Counterstain: Hematoxylin -
Mounting medium - Buffer solutions: PBS (Phosphate Buffered
Saline), washing buffer
3. PROCEDURE A) Specimen Preparation:
1. Deparaffinize tissue sections on slides in xylene (three
changes, 5 minutes each).
2. Rehydrate sections through a graded series of ethanol
(100%, 95%, 70%, 50%, each for 5 minutes) ending with
distilled water.
3. Perform antigen retrieval using citrate buffer (pH 6.0) for
20 minutes at 95-100°C.
B) Immunostaining: 1. Block endogenous peroxidase activity by
incubating slides in 3% hydrogen peroxide for 10 minutes. 2. Wash
slides in PBS buffer (3 times, 5 minutes each). 3. Apply blocking
solution to prevent non-specific binding for 30 minutes. 4. Incubate
slides with primary anti-CAMTA1 antibody (dilution as per
manufacturer instruction) for 1 hour at room temperature. 5. Wash
slides in PBS buffer (3 times, 5 minutes each). 6. Incubate slides with
HRP-conjugated secondary antibody for 30 minutes. 7. Wash slides
in PBS buffer (3 times, 5 minutes each). 8. Develop color using DAB
chromogen for 5-10 minutes until desired staining intensity is
achieved. 9. Wash in distilled water to stop the reaction. 10.
Counterstain with hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes. 11. Wash in distilled
water and dehydrate through graded ethanol series (70%, 95%,
100%) ending in xylene. 12. Apply mounting medium and cover slips.
C) Slide Analysis: 1. Allow slides to dry completely. 2. Examine
stained sections under the light microscope. 3. Identify CAMTA1
staining patterns and document observations. 4. Ensure quality
control by comparing specimens with known positive and negative
controls.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Include positive and negative control slides with each batch
of immunostaining.
◦ Ensure reagents are within expiration dates and stored as
recommended.
◦ Document all steps and observations for traceability.
2. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ Record observations in the laboratory information system
(LIS).
◦ Verify and validate staining results.
◦ Provide technical component results to the designated
pathologist for further interpretation.
3. REFERENCES
◦ Manufacturer's instructions for anti-CAMTA1 antibody and
associated reagents.
◦ Laboratory standard protocols and guidelines for
immunohistochemistry procedures.
This SOP is designed to maintain the accuracy, reliability, and
reproducibility of CAMTA1 immunostaining results, ensuring high-
quality diagnostic support. All laboratory personnel must adhere
strictly to this protocol and address any deviations according to
corrective action procedures.
