Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Calponin Immunostain
- Technical Component Only
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to provide clear instructions on the
technical performance of Calponin immunostaining on formalin-fixed,
paraffin-embedded tissue sections. This SOP applies to all personnel
involved in the staining procedures within the histology laboratory.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing and
documenting the Calponin immunostaining procedures. Supervisors
are responsible for ensuring that each step is correctly followed, and
corrective actions are implemented where necessary.
1. DEFINITION
Calponin is a smooth muscle-specific protein used in
immunohistochemistry (IHC) to help identify smooth muscle cells in
tissue sections. The technical component only refers to the
preparation, staining, and slide preparation stages, excluding any
interpretative reporting.
1. PROCEDURE
Materials and Equipment:
• Positive control tissue (e.g., leiomyoma)
• Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections
• Xylene
• Ethanol (100%, 95%, 80%, 70%)
• Deionized water
• Citrate buffer (10mM, pH 6.0)
• Tris-buffered saline (10mM, pH 7.4)
• Calponin primary antibody
• Secondary antibody appropriate for the detection system used
• Detection system (e.g., HRP-conjugated polymer)
• DAB (3,3'-diaminobenzidine) substrate
• Hematoxylin
• Coverslips
• Slide racks
• Water bath
• Microwave or pressure cooker for antigen retrieval
• Incubation chamber
• Microscope
Procedure Steps:
A. Section Preparation:
1. Cut 3-4 µm sections from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded
tissue blocks.
2. Place sections on adhesive-coated slides and incubate at 60°C
for 1 hour.
B. Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
1. Deparaffinize sections in xylene for 2 changes of 10 minutes
each.
2. Rehydrate through graded ethanol series:
◦ 100% ethanol for 3 minutes, two changes,
◦ 95% ethanol for 3 minutes, two changes,
◦ 80% ethanol for 3 minutes,
◦ 70% ethanol for 3 minutes.
3. Rinse in deionized water for 2 minutes.
C. Antigen Retrieval:
1. Immerse sections in citrate buffer.
2. Heat sections in a microwave or pressure cooker for 20
minutes.
3. Allow the slides to cool in citrate buffer for 20 minutes at room
temperature.
4. Rinse slides in Tris-buffered saline for 5 minutes, 2 changes.
D. Immunostaining:
1. Block endogenous peroxidase activity by incubating slides in
3% hydrogen peroxide for 10 minutes.
2. Rinse in Tris-buffered saline for 5 minutes, 2 changes.
3. Apply primary Calponin antibody to sections and incubate at
room temperature for 30 minutes.
4. Rinse in Tris-buffered saline for 5 minutes, 2 changes.
5. Apply secondary antibody and incubate according to the
manufacturer's instructions, usually 30 minutes at room
temperature.
6. Rinse in Tris-buffered saline for 5 minutes, 2 changes.
7. Apply DAB substrate solution and incubate until the desired
staining intensity is achieved (usually 3-10 minutes).
8. Rinse in deionized water.
E. Counterstaining, Dehydration, and Mounting:
1. Counterstain with hematoxylin for 1 minute.
2. Rinse in deionized water.
3. Dehydrate through graded ethanol:
◦ 70% ethanol for 2 minutes,
◦ 80% ethanol for 2 minutes,
◦ 95% ethanol for 2 minutes,
◦ 100% ethanol for 2 minutes.
4. Clear in xylene for 2 changes of 5 minutes each.
5. Mount with coverslips using a non-aqueous mounting medium.
F. Quality Control:
1. Include positive control tissue in each staining run.
2. Review the positive control to ensure the stain has worked
properly. The presence of smooth muscle cells showing
appropriate staining must be confirmed.
3. If non-specific staining or other issues are observed,
appropriate corrective actions must be taken including
repeating the staining procedure if necessary.
Reporting Results:
• Stained slides are provided to the pathologist for diagnostic
interpretation.
• The pathologist will review technical quality before making any
diagnostic assessments.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Not applicable for the technical component. Interpretation and
diagnosis are the responsibilities of a qualified pathologist.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Factors such as improper tissue handling, fixation, and non-
specific binding can cause artifacts or inadequate staining.
• All steps must be performed precisely to ensure accurate and
reproducible results.
