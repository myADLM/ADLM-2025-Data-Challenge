SOP: Analytical Phase - CALPROTECTIN, FECES
1. PURPOSE
To establish a standardized procedure for the analysis of calprotectin
levels in fecal samples, ensuring accurate and reproducible results.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of trained laboratory personnel to perform and
document the test as described in this protocol. It is the responsibility
of the supervisor to ensure that the personnel are qualified and that
the SOP is followed.
1. DEFINITION
Calprotectin is a protein biomarker found in feces that indicates
inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract. Testing for calprotectin is
useful in the diagnosis and monitoring of inflammatory bowel
diseases (IBD), such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.
1. MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT
• Calprotectin test kit (e.g., ELISA)
• Fecal sample collection container
• Centrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Micropipettes (10 µL, 100 µL, 1000 µL)
• Disposable tips
• Reagent reservoir
• Automated ELISA reader
• Computer with analysis software
• Timer
1. PROCEDURE
4.1 Specimen Collection and Handling
• Ensure that the fecal sample has been collected, received, and
accessioned properly.
• Only accept fecal samples that are properly labeled with the
patient's name, ID number, date, and time of collection.
• If samples are refrigerated, they should be allowed to come to
room temperature before analysis.
4.2 Sample Preparation
• Homogenize the fecal sample by vortexing to ensure a uniform
consistency.
• Weigh out an appropriate amount of fecal material as specified by
the test kit protocol (e.g., 50-100 mg).
• Add the fecal sample to the provided extraction buffer in the test
kit.
• Mix the sample thoroughly using a vortex mixer for at least 30
seconds to ensure complete homogenization.
• Allow the sample to stand or centrifuge the sample according to
the kit’s recommendations (typically 10 minutes at 5000 x g).
4.3 Assay Procedure
A. Prepare the reagents as instructed in the test kit. B. Follow these
steps for performing the ELISA test:
• Pipette the required amount of supernatant from the extracted
sample into the designated wells of the ELISA plate.
• Add standards and controls.
• Add assay buffer as recommended.
• Incubate the plate at room temperature for the time specified in
the kit instructions.
• Wash the wells according to the provided washing protocol.
• Add the conjugate and incubate for the specified time.
• Wash the wells again as per kit instructions.
• Add the substrate solution and incubate for the recommended
time.
• Add the stop solution to each well to terminate the reaction.
• Read the absorbance of the plate at the specified wavelength
(e.g., 450 nm) using an ELISA reader.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
Quality controls must be included in each run to ensure the accuracy
of the results. Include a blank, a negative control, and positive
controls at known concentrations.
• Verify that all quality control results are within the required ranges
before proceeding to assess patient sample results.
• Document all quality control results and any deviations observed.
1. DATA INTERPRETATION AND RESULT REPORTING
• The concentration of calprotectin is calculated from the
absorbance readings using the standard curve generated from
the controls and standards.
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS) for
review.
• Review results for any errors or inconsistencies.
• Notify the ordering physician of critical values according to the
laboratory's protocol.
• Ensure results are verified and reported following the laboratory’s
reporting guidelines.
1. SAMPLE INTEGRITY
• Any samples that show visible signs of contamination, inadequate
volume, or have been stored improperly should be rejected, and
the clinician should be notified.
• If there is suspicion of sample degradation (e.g., due to prolonged
storage), consider requesting a new sample.
• Ensure samples with flagged results are reviewed, and
appropriate actions are taken before reporting.
