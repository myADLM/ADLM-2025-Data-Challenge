CALRETICULIN EX9MUT IMMUNOSTAIN
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedure for performing
the Calreticulin Exon 9 Mutation (CALRETICULIN EX9MUT)
immunostaining process, technical component only. This procedure
ensures accurate and reproducible results for the detection of
Calreticulin mutations in specimens.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory personnel to
perform and document all steps of the Calreticulin Exon 9 mutation
immunostaining process. The laboratory supervisor is responsible for
overseeing the procedure and troubleshooting any issues that may
arise.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND PREPARATION
Preferred/Acceptable Specimens:
• Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue sections
• Fresh tissue, fixed in formalin and embedded in paraffin
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens that are inadequately fixed or processed
• Specimens that are not properly labeled
Specimen Handling:
• Ensure that FFPE tissue sections are no thicker than 5
micrometers.
• Fix tissue in formalin for 6-24 hours before embedding.
• Label specimen containers clearly with patient information and
collection date.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Microtome (for cutting FFPE tissue sections)
• Water bath (for stretching tissue sections)
• Slide warmer (for adhering tissue sections to slides)
• Staining racks and containers
• Light microscope
Reagents:
• Immunostaining kit (containing primary antibody specific for
Calreticulin Exon 9 mutation)
• Secondary antibody (linked to a detection system, such as HRP)
• Chromogen substrate (DAB or similar substrate for visualization)
• Mounting media
Supplies:
• Superfrost Plus microscope slides
• Cover slips
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Disposables (gloves, lab coats, absorbent paper)
1. PROCEDURE
A) Sectioning and Slide Preparation:
1. Cut 4-5 micrometer thick sections from FFPE tissue blocks
using a microtome.
2. Float sections on a water bath set at 40-45°C to stretch them,
then mount onto Superfrost Plus microscope slides.
3. Dry slides on a slide warmer at 60°C for 20 minutes.
B) Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
1. Deparaffinize slides by immersing in xylene for 2x5 minutes.
2. Rehydrate through a series of graded alcohols:
◦ 100% ethanol for 2x3 minutes
◦ 95% ethanol for 1x3 minute
◦ 70% ethanol for 1x3 minute
◦ Distilled water rinse for 2x3 minutes
C) Antigen Retrieval:
1. Immerse slides in a preheated antigen retrieval solution (e.g.,
citrate buffer pH 6.0) at 95-100°C for 20 minutes.
2. Allow slides to cool to room temperature and rinse in distilled
water for 2x3 minutes.
D) Blocking:
1. Apply blocking solution to cover the tissue sections to prevent
nonspecific binding.
2. Incubate blocking solution at room temperature for 30 minutes.
E) Primary Antibody Incubation:
1. Apply primary antibody specific to Calreticulin Exon 9 mutation
(diluted according to manufacturer's instructions) to each
section.
2. Incubate slides in a humidified chamber at room temperature
for 1 hour.
F) Wash:
1. Wash sections with PBS or TBS buffer for 3x5 minutes.
G) Secondary Antibody Incubation:
1. Apply secondary antibody to detected primary antibody.
2. Incubate slides in a humidified chamber at room temperature
for 30 minutes.
3. Wash again with PBS or TBS buffer for 3x5 minutes.
H) Chromogen Development:
1. Apply chromogen substrate working solution to the sections.
2. Monitor for color development (usually 5-10 minutes, but timing
can vary).
3. Wash sections in distilled water to stop reaction.
I) Counterstaining:
1. Immerse slides in hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes.
2. Rinse slides in tap water until clear (1-2 minutes).
3. If required, apply a brief blueing step (usually in lithium
carbonate or ammonia water).
J) Dehydration and Mounting:
1. Dehydrate through graded alcohols:
◦ 70% ethanol for 1x3 minute
◦ 95% ethanol for 1x3 minute
◦ 100% ethanol for 2x3 minutes
2. Clear in xylene for 2x5 minutes.
3. Mount slides with mounting medium and cover slips.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
• Ensure positive and negative controls are run with each batch of
slides.
• Document all findings and lot numbers of reagents utilized.
• Verify staining results under a light microscope for quality
assessment.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
Refer to site-specific guidelines for reporting CALRETICULIN
EX9MUT immunostaining results. Ensure accurate documentation in
the laboratory information system (LIS), and review and verify results
by the technologist before releasing them.
