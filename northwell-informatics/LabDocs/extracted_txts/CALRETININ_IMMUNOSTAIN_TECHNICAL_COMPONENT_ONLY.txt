SOP for Calretinin Immunostain, Technical Component Only
1. Purpose To standardize the procedure for performing Calretinin
immunostaining on tissue specimens, ensuring consistent and
accurate results.
2. Specimen Requirements
◦ Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks.
◦ Cut sections to a thickness of 4 μm.
◦ Label slides with patient identification, accession number,
and sectioning date.
3. Reagents and Supplies
◦ Calretinin primary antibody
◦ Envision System HRP-labeled polymer anti-rabbit
secondary antibody
◦ DAB chromogen (3,3'-diaminobenzidine)
◦ Hematoxylin counterstain
◦ Xylene and ethanol for deparaffinization and dehydration
◦ Tris-buffered saline (TBS) with or without Tween 20 (TBS-T)
◦ Heat-induced epitope retrieval solution (citrate buffer, pH 6.0
or EDTA, pH 8.0)
◦ Mounting medium
◦ Positive control slides
4. Procedure
A) Preparation of Slides
• Deparaffinize tissue sections by immersing slides in xylene for 3
changes, 5 minutes each.
• Rehydrate slides through a series of ethanol solutions: 100%
ethanol twice for 3 minutes each, 95% ethanol twice for 3 minutes
each, 70% ethanol for 3 minutes, followed by rinsing in distilled
water.
B) Heat-Induced Epitope Retrieval
• Immerse slides in a pressure cooker containing citrate buffer (pH
6.0) or EDTA buffer (pH 8.0).
• Heat for 20 minutes at 95-100°C.
• Allow slides to cool to room temperature in the retrieval solution
for 20 minutes.
• Wash slides in TBS or TBS-T for 5 minutes.
C) Blocking and Primary Antibody Incubation
• Apply a protein block (e.g., serum-free protein block) for 10
minutes to reduce non-specific staining.
• Drain excess blocking solution, do not wash.
• Incubate slides with Calretinin primary antibody at the
manufacturer's recommended dilution for 30 minutes at room
temperature or overnight at 4°C.
• Wash slides in TBS or TBS-T for 3 changes, 5 minutes each.
D) Secondary Antibody Incubation
• Apply the HRP-labeled polymer anti-rabbit secondary antibody for
30 minutes at room temperature.
• Wash slides with TBS or TBS-T for 3 changes, 5 minutes each.
E) Chromogen Development
• Apply DAB chromogen solution and incubate until the desired
intensity of staining is achieved (typically 5-10 minutes).
• Wash slides in distilled water for 5 minutes.
F) Counterstaining and Mounting
• Counterstain with hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes.
• Wash slides in running tap water for 3-5 minutes.
• Dehydrate through graded alcohols (70%, 95%, 100% ethanol), 2
changes, 2 minutes each.
• Clear in xylene, 3 changes, 5 minutes each.
• Coverslip using a compatible mounting medium.
1. Quality Control
• Include a positive control slide with each staining run to ensure
the antibody is working as expected.
• Ensure that the correct staining pattern is achieved without
background staining on the positive control.
1. Reporting Results
• Document that the technical component of the Calretinin
immunostain has been successfully completed.
• Pass slides to the pathologist for interpretation.
• Log all completed stains, noting any observed issues and
corrective actions.
1. References
• Manufacturer's protocol for Calretinin primary antibody.
• Laboratory's immunohistochemistry handbook or protocol
guidelines.
1. Appendix: Troubleshooting Guide
• Weak or no staining: Check antigen retrieval method, antibody
dilution, and incubation conditions.
• High background staining: Review blocking step, wash buffers,
and antibody specificity.
• Uneven staining: Ensure uniform tissue sections, consistent
reagent application, and proper slide handling.
