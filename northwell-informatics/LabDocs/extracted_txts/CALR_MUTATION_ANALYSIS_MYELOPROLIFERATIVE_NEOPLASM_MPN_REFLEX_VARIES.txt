1. PURPOSE
To establish a standardized procedure for performing CALR Mutation
Analysis in patients suspected of having Myeloproliferative Neoplasm
(MPN) and ensuring accurate, reliable, and timely results.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all designated laboratory personnel to
perform and document CALR Mutation Analysis according to this
SOP. Supervisors must ensure this procedure is followed and that all
corrective actions are performed if necessary.
1. SCOPE
This procedure applies to the CALR Mutation Analysis performed in
the Molecular Diagnostics Laboratory for patients with suspected or
confirmed MPN.
1. SPECIMEN
Specimen Type: Peripheral blood or bone marrow Required Volume:
3-5 mL of peripheral blood in EDTA tube or 1-2 mL of bone marrow in
EDTA tube Stability: Specimens should be kept at 2-8°C and
processed within 48 hours of collection.
1. EQUIPMENT, SUPPLIES, AND REAGENTS
• DNA extraction kit
• PCR reagents and primers specific for CALR mutations
• Agarose gel electrophoresis kit
• Sequencing equipment or capillary electrophoresis equipment
• Positive and negative controls
• Thermal cycler
• Documentation tools – log book, result recording software
1. PROCEDURE
A. DNA Extraction:
1. Specimen Preparation:
◦ Verify patient identification and match it with the specimen
and requisition form.
◦ Ensure specimen quality (e.g., no clotting, proper
anticoagulant).
2. DNA Extraction:
◦ Follow the DNA extraction kit protocol to isolate genomic
DNA from peripheral blood or bone marrow.
◦ Quantify and assess the quality of extracted DNA using a
spectrophotometer or fluorometer.
B. PCR Amplification:
1. Preparation of PCR Master Mix:
◦ Prepare PCR master mix with reagents including Taq
polymerase, dNTPs, PCR buffer, MgCl2, and specific
primers for CALR mutations.
2. PCR Cycles:
◦ Program the thermal cycler for initial denaturation,
annealing, extension cycles based on the optimized
conditions for CALR mutation analysis (e.g., 35 cycles,
primer annealing temp at 55°C).
3. Quality Control:
◦ Include positive and negative controls in the PCR run.
◦ Ensure no contamination during preparation by using
dedicated workspaces for reagents and templates.
C. Post-PCR Analysis:
1. Agarose Gel Electrophoresis:
◦ Prepare and cast agarose gel.
◦ Load PCR product and run electrophoresis to separate
amplified fragments.
◦ Visualize bands under UV light and compare with controls.
D. Sequencing or Capillary Electrophoresis:
1. Sample Preparation:
◦ Generate clean PCR product using a post-PCR cleanup
method.
◦ Prepare sample for sequencing or capillary electrophoresis
as per equipment protocol.
2. Mutation Analysis:
◦ Analyze the sequence data for CALR mutations.
◦ Document mutations and compare with known mutation
database.
E. Results and Reporting:
1. Result Documentation:
◦ Record all findings in the laboratory information system
(LIS).
◦ Include all controls and ensure proper documentation of
results.
2. Interpretation and Reporting:
◦ Interpret the findings based on known CALR mutation
impact and clinical relevance.
◦ Generate report including:
▪ Patient identification details
▪ Methodology used
▪ Results and interpretation
▪ Recommendations, if any
3. QC and Corrective Measures:
◦ If results are unclear or controls fail, repeat the PCR
analysis.
◦ Notify supervisor if persistent issues arise with samples or
equipment.
F. Critical Values and Reflex Testing:
1. Reflex Testing:
◦ If the initial CALR mutation analysis does not confirm MPN,
reflex testing for JAK2 or MPL mutations may be suggested.
◦ Follow respective SOPs for additional mutation analysis.
G. Storage and Disposal:
1. Specimen Storage:
◦ Store leftover DNA at -20°C for possible further testing.
2. Waste Disposal:
◦ Follow biosafety and hazardous material protocols for
disposing of biological and chemical waste.
3. QUALITY CONTROL
Internal Quality Control:
• Perform routine checks and validate the reagents and equipment
weekly.
• Record and analyze QC data for trends indicating potential
issues.
