Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for CALR Mutation
Analysis in Myeloproliferative Neoplasms (MPN)
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to detect mutations in the CALR
(calreticulin) gene in patients suspected of having Myeloproliferative
Neoplasms (MPN). The detection of CALR mutations assists in the
diagnosis and classification of MPN, aiding in appropriate patient
management and therapeutic decision-making.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the trained laboratory personnel to ensure all
steps of this procedure are executed accurately and meticulously. It is
also critical to ensure that quality control (QC) measures are properly
followed and documented. Any anomalies or deviations from the
expected process or results should be reported to the designated
supervisor immediately.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred Specimens:
• Peripheral blood collected in EDTA tubes.
• Bone marrow aspirate collected in EDTA tubes.
Specimen Handling:
• Store specimens at 4°C and process within 48 hours of collection.
• If there are delays, the specimen can be frozen at -20°C and
should be tested within one month.
• Ensure that specimens are labeled with patient identification and
collection date/time.
• Unacceptable specimens include those that are clotted,
hemolyzed, or not labeled properly.
4. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
Equipment:
• PCR Thermocycler
• Nucleic acid extraction system
• Electrophoresis system or sequencing platform
Reagents:
• DNA extraction kit
• PCR Master Mix
• CALR mutation-specific primers
• PCR grade water
• DNA markers
• Gel electrophoresis reagents (if applicable)
• Sequencing reagents (if applicable)
5. PROCEDURE
A. DNA Extraction:
1. Isolate genomic DNA from peripheral blood or bone marrow
samples using a commercial DNA extraction kit according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Quantify the DNA concentration using a spectrophotometer and
ensure the quality of the DNA by assessing the A260/A280 ratio
(acceptable ratio: 1.8-2.0).
B. PCR Amplification:
1. Prepare the PCR Master Mix in a PCR-clean area, including the
components in the following concentrations per reaction:
◦ PCR Buffer
◦ dNTPs
◦ Forward Primer
◦ Reverse Primer
◦ Taq Polymerase
◦ Template DNA
◦ PCR grade water
2. Set up the PCR reactions in 0.2 mL PCR tubes or a PCR plate.
3. Program the thermal cycler with the following PCR conditions:
◦ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 5 minutes
◦ 35 cycles of:
▪ Denaturation: 95°C for 30 seconds
▪ Annealing: 60°C for 30 seconds
▪ Extension: 72°C for 30 seconds
◦ Final extension: 72°C for 5 minutes
4. Hold the samples at 4°C until further analysis.
C. Detection of Amplified Products: i. Gel Electrophoresis:
• Prepare a 2% agarose gel with ethidium bromide or an alternative
DNA stain.
• Load the PCR products with loading dye and run alongside a DNA
ladder.
• Run the gel at 100V for approximately 1 hour or until bands are
sufficiently separated.
• Visualize and document the DNA bands under UV light using a
gel documentation system.
ii. Sanger Sequencing (if applicable):
• Clean up PCR products using a PCR purification kit.
• Perform sequencing reactions using the same primers used for
amplification.
• Analyze the sequence data using appropriate software to detect
mutations in the CALR gene.
D. Result Interpretation:
1. Compare the size of the amplified products with a DNA ladder
to identify potential indels (insertions/deletions) common in
CALR mutations.
2. If sequencing was performed, analyze the sequence for known
CALR mutations and compare to reference sequences to
confirm mutation status.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include a positive control (a sample known to carry a CALR
mutation) and a negative control (no template DNA) in each run.
• Assess the integrity and quality of reagents periodically through
routine QC checks.
• Document all QC results; any runs with control failures must be
rerun.
• Maintain equipment calibration according to manufacturer
guidelines and lab standards.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
• Document the final interpretation of the results in the Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
• Report the findings to the referring clinician or department,
ensuring the report includes the presence or absence of CALR
mutations and any relevant interpretive comments.
• Include references to normal ranges and mutation-specific
implications for patient management.
8. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• A negative result indicates no detectable CALR mutations.
• Specific known mutations and their clinical relevance should be
provided in case of a positive result.
9. REFERENCES
Refer to scientific literature and guidelines (e.g., WHO classification
of MPN, journal articles) for interpretative guidance and updated
methodologies.
10. DOCUMENTATION
Ensure all procedural details, consumable lot numbers, equipment
calibration logs, and QC results are documented and archived
according to laboratory policies.
This SOP should be reviewed and revised periodically to maintain
accuracy and compliance with current scientific and regulatory
standards.
