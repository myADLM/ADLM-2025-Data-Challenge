Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Campylobacter Culture, Feces
1. PURPOSE
To delineate the proper steps required to accurately culture and
identify Campylobacter species from fecal specimens, ensuring
consistent and reliable results for diagnostic and treatment purposes.
Responsibility: All medical laboratory scientists (MLS) and trained
laboratory personnel are responsible for following this procedure to
ensure proper processing, incubation, isolation, and identification of
Campylobacter species.
1. PRINCIPLE AND/OR SCOPE
This procedure outlines the steps from fecal specimen preparation to
the final identification of Campylobacter species, leveraging selective
growth media and appropriate incubation conditions to selectively
isolate Campylobacter from fecal microbiota.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen:
• Freshly collected fecal specimens submitted in transport media or
stored at 2-8°C and transported to the laboratory within 24 hours
of collection.
Unacceptable:
• Specimens older than 24 hours without proper transport media.
• Specimens that have not been refrigerated and exceed 24 hours
from collection.
• Specimens that are not labelled correctly.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Incubator set to 42°C
• Microaerophilic system (e.g., CampyPak, EZ Campy Pouch)
• Selective media for Campylobacter (e.g., Campylobacter Agar,
Skirrow Agar)
• Pre-reduced thioglycollate broth
• Sterile inoculating loops and swabs
• Bunsen burner or sterilization tool
• Microscope and gram-staining supplies
• Oxidase reagent
• Antimicrobial susceptibility testing (optional)
1. PROCEDURE
A) Inoculation and Incubation:
1. Using a sterile inoculating loop, obtain a small portion of feces
(about the size of a pea) from the sample.
2. Transfer the specimen thoroughly to Campylobacter selective
agar plate.
3. Streak the specimen for isolation using the four quadrant
streaking method to ensure well-isolated colonies.
4. Inoculate a portion of the specimen into pre-reduced
thioglycollate broth for enrichment.
5. Place the inoculated plates into the microaerophilic system to
create appropriate low-oxygen conditions.
6. Incubate at 42°C for 48 hours.
B) Examination and Identification:
1. After incubation, observe plates for characteristic
Campylobacter colony morphology - moist, spreading colonies
that may appear grayish or creamy.
2. Perform a gram stain on suspected colonies. Typical
Campylobacter species are Gram-negative, slender spiral-
shaped rods.
3. Conduct oxidase test on suspected colonies - Campylobacter
species are oxidase positive.
4. If confirmation is required, biochemical testing or MALDI-TOF
can be used for species-level identification.
5. Perform antimicrobial susceptibility testing if needed for
treatment guidance.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
A. Perform routine QC using known positive and negative control
strains to ensure media, reagents, and incubation conditions are
appropriate. B. Proper documentation of control results in QC logs.
C. Review and evaluate any deviations and apply necessary
corrections.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
A. Negative Result:
• Report as “No Campylobacter isolated.” B. Positive Result:
• Report as “Campylobacter species isolated.”
• Specify species-level identification if conducted.
• Include antimicrobial susceptibility results if performed.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
A. Overgrowth of other fecal flora may mask the presence of
Campylobacter. B. Improper transport or handling may result in
failure to isolate Campylobacter. C. Ensure optimal culture
environment (microaerophilic, 42°C) to enhance recovery.
