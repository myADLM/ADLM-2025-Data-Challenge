Standard Operating Procedure for Analysis of Canary Feathers,
IgE, Serum
1. Purpose
To outline the procedure for the analysis of Canary Feathers, IgE,
Serum to ensure accurate and consistent results. This SOP provides
instructions for the handling, processing, and analysis of serum
samples for the determination of specific IgE antibodies to canary
feathers.
1. Scope
This procedure applies to all personnel involved in the analytical
phase of canary feathers, IgE, serum testing within the laboratory.
1. Definitions
Canary Feathers, IgE, Serum: A specific IgE antibody test
performed on serum samples to detect allergic sensitization to canary
feathers.
1. Responsibilities
• Laboratory Staff: Responsible for performing the analysis
according to this SOP.
• Supervisors: Ensure staff are trained and adhere to this SOP.
Review and approve final results.
• Quality Control Personnel: Monitor and document all quality
control measures.
1. Specimen Requirements and Handling
• Specimen Type: 2-3mL of serum.
• Collection: Blood is drawn by venipuncture into a serum
separator tube (SST). Allow the blood to clot for 30 minutes.
• Processing: Centrifuge the clotted blood at 1500-2000 RCF for
10 minutes to separate the serum.
• Storage: Store serum at 2-8°C if analysis is to be performed
within 72 hours. For longer storage, freeze at -20°C or below.
1. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies
• ELISA or ImmunoCAP analyzer.
• Canary feathers IgE-specific assay kits.
• Calibrated micropipettes and tips.
• Serum separator tubes (SST).
• Centrifuge.
• Vortex mixer.
• Incubator (37°C).
• Essential laboratory reagents (e.g., wash buffer, substrate, stop
solution).
1. Quality Control
• Use internal quality control samples following manufacturer
guidelines.
• Run quality control samples at the beginning of each assay run
and document results.
• Verify control results are within acceptable ranges before
proceeding with patient sample analysis.
• If controls fail, investigate and resolve the cause before re-running
controls and patient samples.
1. Procedure
A. Preparation
1. Bring all reagents and samples to room temperature prior to
use.
2. Prepare standards, controls, and samples according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
3. Label all tubes, strips, and plates clearly with patient identifiers.
B. Assay Procedure
1. Sample Preparation: Vortex the serum samples briefly to
ensure homogeneity.
2. Pipetting: Add the recommended volume of sample (typically
50-100 µL) to the wells or tubes as per manufacturer’s
instructions.
3. Incubation: Incubate the samples at 37°C for the specified time
according to the assay kit instructions.
4. Washing: Wash the wells or tubes using the provided wash
buffer to remove unbound substances (following the kit's
specified number of wash cycles).
5. Detection: Add detection antibody/enzyme conjugate to each
well/tube and incubate as described in the assay protocol.
6. Substrate Addition: Add the substrate solution to each well/
tube to develop the color reaction.
7. Stop Reaction: Add the stop solution to each well/tube within
the recommended time frame.
8. Reading: Measure the optical density (OD) using an
appropriate plate reader set to the wavelength specified by the
assay kit (e.g., 450 nm with a reference filter at 620 nm).
C. Calculation of Results
1. Calculate the concentration of IgE antibodies to canary feathers
in each sample using the standard curve generated from the
known standards.
2. Express the results in kUA/L.
3. Reporting Results
• Recording Data: Record the OD readings and calculated
concentrations in the laboratory information system (LIS).
• Result Review: Review all results for accuracy and consistency.
Flag any results requiring repeat analysis due to out-of-range
quality control or other anomalies.
• Reporting: Validate and verify results before reporting to the
requesting clinician. Ensure all critical values are promptly
communicated following laboratory protocols.
