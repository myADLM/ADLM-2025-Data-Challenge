Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analysis of CANARY
GRASS, IGE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this standard operating procedure (SOP) is to outline
the steps required to perform the analytical phase of generating
serum Immunoglobulin E (IgE) results specific to Canary Grass
allergen in a CLIA-certified laboratory. This procedure targets
ensuring accurate, reliable, and reproducible results.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory personnel perform the analysis,
documentation, and reporting of results.
• Supervisors provide oversight, ensuring adherence to procedures,
quality control, and troubleshooting as necessary.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/Acceptable Specimen:
• 3-5 mL of serum collected in a red-top tube or serum separator
tube (SST).
• Serum should be separated from the clot within 2 hours of
collection and stored at 2-8°C.
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Serum samples with significant hemolysis, chylous serum, or
grossly lipemic serum.
• Specimens arriving in the laboratory more than 72 hours post-
collection without appropriate storage conditions (2-8°C).
• Specimens lacking appropriate labeling, collection date/time, or
patient identification.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
3.1. Equipment:
• Immunoassay Analyzer (e.g., Phadia ImmunoCAP system)
• Centrifuge for serum separation
• Calibrated pipettes and tips
3.2. Reagents:
• Canary Grass allergen-specific IgE ImmunoCAP test kits
• Calibrators, controls, and wash solutions provided in the
ImmunoCAP test kit
• Quality control material (negative and positive controls)
3.3. Supplies:
• Red-top or serum separator tubes (SST)
• Gloves, lab coat, and other personal protective equipment (PPE)
• Logbooks and documentation materials
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform quality control (QC) with each run of patient specimens
using negative and positive control sera.
• Calibrate the ImmunoCAP system according to the
manufacturer’s instructions with each change of reagent lot or
following significant maintenance.
• Record all QC and calibration results in the logbook.
• If QC results are out of acceptable range, do not proceed with
patient samples until the cause is determined and resolved. Notify
the supervisor and follow troubleshooting procedures.
1. PROCEDURE
5.1. Sample Preparation:
1. Upon specimen receipt, verify patient information and ensure
proper labeling.
2. Centrifuge the red-top or SST tube at 1000–1500 x g for 10
minutes to separate serum.
3. Transfer the serum to a labeled aliquot tube, if not already in
SST.
4. Store serum aliquots at 2-8°C if analysis is to be performed
within 72 hours, or freeze at -20°C for longer storage.
5.2. Analysis:
1. Prepare the ImmunoCAP system and load the reagents
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Load patient serum samples, calibrators, and controls into the
sample racks.
3. Start the ImmunoCAP system analysis run, ensuring proper
documentation in the instrument log.
4. Monitor the run for any system alerts or errors and address
them as needed.
5. Once the run is complete, review the results provided by the
ImmunoCAP system.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
7. Verify and cross-check results against the QC data to ensure
validity.
8. If QC data is acceptable, proceed with data entry into the
Laboratory Information System (LIS).
9. Review and validate results in LIS before releasing them.
10. Report any critical values according to the laboratory’s critical
results notification policy.
11. Document patient results, including any necessary comments
or notes regarding sample integrity or analysis issues.
12. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Specific IgE to Canary Grass (kUA/L):
◦ <0.1: Negative
◦ 0.1–0.34: Low
◦ 0.35–0.69: Moderate
◦ 0.70–3.49: High
◦ 3.50: Very High
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to the ImmunoCAP product insert for detailed information
on limitations.
• High levels of RF (rheumatoid factors) and heterophilic antibodies
can occasionally cause interference in the results.
• Ensure thorough mixing of serum samples to avoid incomplete
reactions.

and standards
1. TROUBLESHOOTING
• For QC or calibration failures, repeat the run following
troubleshooting guides provided by the instrument or reagent
manufacturer.
• Persistent issues should be escalated to the designated
supervisor and the instrument manufacturer’s technical support
team.
1. DOCUMENTATION
• Maintain thorough documentation of all steps including specimen
processing, QC results, reagent lot numbers, calibration,
equipment maintenance, and patient results.
• Document any deviations, corrective actions, and troubleshooting
efforts in the logbook.
By following this SOP, laboratory personnel will ensure reliable and
accurate results in the analysis of Canary Grass, IgE, Serum,
contributing to effective patient diagnosis and management.
