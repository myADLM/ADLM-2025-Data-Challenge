Cancer-Associated Retinopathy Panel (CARP) by Immunoblot
and IHC
1. PURPOSE
The protocol is designed to ensure accurate, reliable, and timely
results for Cancer-Associated Retinopathy Panel (CARP) by
immunoblot and immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis. It details the
steps and procedures to be followed in the analytical phase of the
testing process, ensuring consistency and quality control throughout.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory staff responsible for processing,
analyzing, and reporting the Cancer-Associated Retinopathy Panel
(CARP) results using immunoblot and IHC methods.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing
the analysis according to this protocol.
• Supervisors are responsible for reviewing results, troubleshooting
issues, and ensuring adherence to the procedures outlined.
• It is the responsibility of all staff to bring any problems to the
attention of a supervisor.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Equipment:
◦ Gel electrophoresis systems
◦ Immunoblotting equipment (e.g., transfer apparatus)
◦ Incubator for IHC
◦ Microscope with camera attachment for IHC
• Reagents and Supplies:
◦ Primary and secondary antibodies
◦ ECL (Enhanced Chemiluminescence) substrate for
immunoblotting
◦ Detection substrates for IHC
◦ Paraffin-embedded tissue sections
◦ Buffer solutions (e.g., TBS, TBST)
◦ Blocking reagents
◦ Dako Universal Blocking Solution
◦ Xylene, ethanol, and other solvents
◦ Mounting media and coverslips
5. PROCEDURE
A. Immunoblot
1. Sample Preparation
◦ Prepare retinal protein lysates or other relevant tissue
samples, ensuring equal loading by determining protein
concentration using appropriate methods (e.g., Bradford
assay).
◦ Store samples at -80°C until use.
2. Gel Electrophoresis
◦ Load equal amounts of protein samples onto SDS-PAGE
gels.
◦ Run electrophoresis under appropriate conditions for
separation.
3. Protein Transfer
◦ Transfer proteins from gel to a PVDF or nitrocellulose
membrane using a semi-dry or wet transfer system.
4. Blocking
◦ Block the membrane with a suitable blocking buffer (e.g.,
5% non-fat milk in TBST) for 1 hour at room temperature.
5. Primary Antibody Incubation
◦ Incubate membrane with primary antibody specific to target
proteins (retinal autoantibodies) overnight at 4°C with gentle
rocking.
6. Washing
◦ Wash membrane thoroughly with TBST to remove unbound
primary antibodies.
7. Secondary Antibody Incubation
◦ Incubate membrane with HRP-conjugated secondary
antibodies for 1 hour at room temperature.
8. Detection
◦ Develop the blot using ECL substrate and capture the
chemiluminescent signal using a gel documentation system.
9. Analysis
◦ Analyze the bands and compare with known positive and
negative controls.
◦ Quantify band intensity using appropriate software.
B. Immunohistochemistry (IHC)
1. Tissue Section Preparation
◦ Deparaffinize tissue sections using xylene and rehydrate
through graded ethanol series to water.
2. Antigen Retrieval
◦ Perform antigen retrieval using appropriate methods (e.g.,
heat-induced epitope retrieval) as per antibody datasheet
instructions.
3. Blocking
◦ Apply a universal blocking solution to the tissue sections to
block non-specific binding.
4. Primary Antibody Incubation
◦ Incubate slides with primary antibodies specific to retinal
autoantigens overnight at 4°C.
5. Washing
◦ Wash slides with buffer solution (e.g., TBS) to remove
unbound primary antibodies.
6. Secondary Antibody Incubation
◦ Incubate slides with an appropriate biotinylated or enzyme-
labeled secondary antibody for 1 hour at room temperature.
7. Detection
◦ Develop the signal using appropriate chromogen (e.g., DAB)
and counterstain with hematoxylin.
8. Mounting
◦ Dehydrate slides through graded ethanols to xylene and
coverslip using mounting media.
9. Microscopy
◦ Examine the slides under a microscope, capture images,
and analyze staining patterns. Record the intensity and
distribution of staining compared to negative and positive
controls.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include known positive and negative controls for both immunoblot
and IHC procedures.
• Verify antibody specificity by including absorption control (antigen-
blocked antibody) if available.
• Document all deviations from the SOP and any troubleshooting
steps taken.
• Analyze quality control data and ensure all results fall within
acceptable ranges before reporting.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
• Compile detailed reports that include findings from both
immunoblot and IHC methods.
• Review and verify results by a secondary technologist or
supervisor before releasing to the ordering physician.
• Record and maintain all data and images in the laboratory
information system (LIS).
8. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's instruction manuals for antibodies and reagents
used.
• Quality control guidelines and proficiency testing protocols.
• Relevant literature and standard references in the field of clinical
immunology and pathology.
9. DOCUMENTATION
• All steps of the procedure must be documented in real-time,
including lot numbers of reagents, conditions of the assays, and
any deviations from the SOP.
• Records should be maintained for an appropriate period as
determined by regulatory guidelines.
10. TROUBLESHOOTING
• Consult the supervisor or technical support for any issues related
to equipment malfunction, reagent performance, or unexpected
results.
• Document all troubleshooting steps taken and any resolutions or
modifications to the protocol.
This protocol is to be reviewed and updated annually or as needed to
maintain compliance with current standards and technological
advancements.
