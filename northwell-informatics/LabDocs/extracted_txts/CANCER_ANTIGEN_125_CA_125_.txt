Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Cancer Antigen 125 (CA
125) Analysis
1. PURPOSE: The purpose of this Standard Operating Procedure
(SOP) is to outline the procedure for the analysis of Cancer
Antigen 125 (CA 125) in patient samples. This SOP provides
detailed instructions for the preparation, analysis, and
documentation required to ensure accurate and reliable test
results.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory staff are responsible for
following this SOP to perform CA 125 analysis. Supervisors are
responsible for ensuring compliance and addressing any issues or
discrepancies.
1. DEFINITION: Cancer Antigen 125 (CA 125) is a protein that is a
biomarker for ovarian cancer, among other conditions. The
concentration of CA 125 in the blood can be measured using
immunoassay techniques.
2. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES:
• Automated immunoassay analyzer (e.g., Roche Cobas e411,
Siemens IMMULITE)
• Essential pipette sets and tips
• CA 125 reagent kit (specific to the immunoassay analyzer being
used)
• Calibrators and controls (low, medium, high)
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
• Laboratory glassware (e.g., tubes, sample cups)
• Sample racks
• Timer
• Absorbent wipes for spill management
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY:
• Preferred specimen: Serum collected in a serum separator tube
(SST) or plasma collected in heparinized tubes.
• Unacceptable specimens: Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric
specimens.
• Stability: Separated serum or plasma can be stored at 2-8°C for
up to 48 hours. For long-term storage, samples should be stored
at -20°C or colder.
1. PROCEDURE:
A) Sample Preparation:
1. Verify that the specimen meets the acceptance criteria.
2. Centrifuge the specimen at 1,500-2,000g for 10 minutes to
separate serum/plasma from cells.
3. Prepare samples for analysis as per the immunoassay
analyzer’s instructions.
B) Instrument Setup:
1. Turn on the immunoassay analyzer and perform a daily
maintenance check as per the manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Ensure the analyzer is calibrated with CA 125 calibrators.
3. Load reagent kits, calibrators, and controls into the analyzer
according to the manufacturer’s guidelines.
C) Running the Test:
1. Load patient samples into the sample rack and place them on
the analyzer.
2. Input sample identification and test requests into the analyzer
software.
3. Start the analysis process. The analyzer will automatically
process and measure CA 125 levels in the samples.
D) Quality Control:
1. Run quality control samples (low, medium, high) at the
beginning of each shift or as specified by the laboratory’s
quality control plan.
2. Verify that quality control results are within the acceptable
range before releasing patient results. If out-of-range,
investigate and resolve issues before proceeding with patient
sample analysis.
3. Document all quality control results in the QC log.
E) Result Interpretation and Reporting:
1. Review the results generated by the analyzer for any flags or
errors.
2. If results are within expected ranges and quality control is
acceptable, transfer results to the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
3. Ensure any critical results are flagged and reported to the
ordering physician as per laboratory policy.
F) Maintenance and Documentation:
1. Regularly clean and maintain the analyzer according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Document all maintenance, calibrations, and service activities
in the maintenance log.
3. Ensure all documentation related to CA 125 testing (e.g., QC
logs, maintenance logs) is complete and stored according to
laboratory policy.
4. REFERENCE INTERVALS:
• Reference intervals for CA 125 levels are typically <35 U/mL.
Interpret results in conjunction with patient history and other
diagnostic information.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
• Elevated CA 125 levels are not specific to ovarian cancer and can
be seen in other conditions such as endometriosis, liver disease,
and normal menstruation.
• Refer to the immunoassay kit manufacturer’s insert for any
additional method-specific limitations.
1. REFERENCES:
• Manufacturer’s instruction manual for the immunoassay analyzer.
• Kit insert for CA 125 reagent kits.
• Current clinical guidelines and relevant literature.
This SOP provides a comprehensive guide for performing CA 125
analysis to ensure consistent, accurate, and reliable results. Regular
review and updates to this SOP should be conducted to incorporate
any new techniques, equipment, and quality standards.
