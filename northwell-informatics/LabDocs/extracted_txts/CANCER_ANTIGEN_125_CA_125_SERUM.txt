STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP) ANALYTICAL
PHASE: CANCER ANTIGEN 125 (CA 125), SERUM
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to provide a standardized procedure for
the measurement of Cancer Antigen 125 (CA 125) in serum samples
in the clinical laboratory.
1. SCOPE
This procedure is applicable to all laboratory personnel who are
responsible for performing and reporting CA 125 testing.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
All designated lab personnel are responsible for:
• Ensuring that they are adequately trained to perform the CA 125
assay.
• Strict adherence to the procedure as defined in this SOP.
• Proper documentation of the testing process.
• Reporting any deviations or problems to the supervisor.
1. DEFINITION
Cancer Antigen 125 (CA 125) is a protein that is considered a tumor
marker. It is measured primarily to monitor the treatment of certain
cancers, such as ovarian cancer.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Serum.
• Preferred Specimen: Serum samples collected in a red-top or
serum separator tube (SST).
• Volume: At least 1 mL of serum.
• Stability: Serum samples are stable for up to 7 days when
refrigerated at 2-8°C and for up to 6 months when frozen at -20°C
or colder.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed specimens.
• Specimens with gross lipemia or icterus.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• CA 125 assay reagents and controls (specific to the testing
platform used, e.g., ELISA, chemiluminescent immunoassay,
etc.).
• Plate reader or analyzer (as per manufacturer’s instructions).
• Control materials: Low, Normal, and High CA 125 controls.
• Calibrators: Provided by the assay manufacturer.
1. PROCEDURE
7.1 Preparation
1. Allow all reagents, calibrators, and controls to reach room
temperature before use.
2. Mix all reagents and controls gently before use, avoiding the
formation of bubbles.
7.2 Calibration
1. Perform calibration as required according to the manufacturer’s
guidelines.
2. Document the calibration results in the appropriate log.
7.3 Quality Control
1. Run both Low and High CA 125 controls at the beginning of
each shift or batch of tests, after calibration, and whenever a
new reagent lot is used.
2. Document the control results in the Quality Control Log.
3. Ensure that the control results fall within the established
acceptable range before continuing with patient testing. If
controls are out of acceptable range, follow the troubleshooting
procedures.
7.4 Sample Testing
1. Label appropriate number of tubes or wells for patient samples,
calibrators, and controls.
2. Add the required volume of serum sample, control, or calibrator
to each tube or well as instructed by the kit manufacturer.
3. Add the required volume of specific reagents to each tube or
well as instructed.
4. Follow all incubation and washing steps precisely as outlined in
the manufacturer’s instructions.
5. Measure the optical density or signal according to the
analyzer’s instructions.
7.5 Result Calculation
1. Calculate the results using the calibration curve generated
during the calibration step.
2. Convert the optical density or signal readings into CA 125
concentration using the calibrator values.
3. Document the results in the laboratory information system
(LIS).
4. INTERPRETING AND REPORTING RESULTS
Reference Range: The reference range for CA 125 is typically <35 U/
mL. However, range may vary by method and population; refer to
specific manufacturer's instructions or literature.
Critical Values: If patient results fall outside the defined reference
range, review the patient's history and consider verifying the result
with a repeat test or alternative method.
Documentation:
• Results must be reviewed and verified before reporting.
• Record all details including patient ID, sample ID, result, date, and
testing personnel in the LIS.
• Report results according to the laboratory's reporting protocols.
1. MAINTENANCE
• Regularly perform instrument maintenance as per the
manufacturer's schedule.
• Document all maintenance activities in the maintenance log.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If control values fall outside of the acceptable range, do not report
patient results until the issue is resolved.
• Refer to the assay manual for troubleshooting guidelines.
• Consult with the supervisor or manufacturer technical support as
needed.
1. REFERENCE
• Manufacturer’s package insert and technical manual for the CA
125 assay.
• Laboratory’s Quality Control and Assurance Guidelines.
1. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS
• Follow all appropriate laboratory safety guidelines, including use
of personal protective equipment (PPE).
• Handle all biological samples and reagents as potentially
hazardous materials.
1. REVIEW
This SOP should be reviewed annually or when there is a change in
the methodology, reagent, instrument, or regulation.
