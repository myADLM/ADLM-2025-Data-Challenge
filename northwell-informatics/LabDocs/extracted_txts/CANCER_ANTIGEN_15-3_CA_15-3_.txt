Protocol for Analytical Testing of Cancer Antigen 15-3 (CA 15-3)
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this standard operating procedure (SOP) is to ensure
consistent and accurate analytical testing of Cancer Antigen 15-3 (CA
15-3), an oncological biomarker used primarily in the management of
breast cancer.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the CA
15-3 assay, documenting data, and ensuring quality control.
Supervisors are responsible for reviewing results and addressing any
issues that arise during testing.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Serum or plasma (collected in SST, PST, or
EDTA tubes).
• Volume: A minimum of 1 mL of specimen is required.
• Stability: Specimens can be stored at 4°C for up to 48 hours
post-collection. For long-term storage, specimens should be
frozen at -20°C or lower.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Automated Immunoassay Analyzer (e.g., Roche Cobas, Abbott
Architect, etc.)
• CA 15-3 reagent kits, calibrators, and controls, specifically
designed for use with the chosen analyzer
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Sample cups or tubes
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
1. PROCEDURE
Sample Preparation:
1. Thaw frozen specimens at room temperature and mix gently.
2. Centrifuge all specimens at 1500 x g for 10 minutes to ensure
removal of particulates.
3. Transfer the clear serum or plasma to a sample cup/tube
without disturbing the cell layer.
Assay Procedure:
1. Daily Setup and Calibration:
◦ Turn on the immunoassay analyzer and perform a system
check.
◦ Ensure reagents, calibrators, and quality control (QC)
materials are at room temperature.
◦ Load the CA 15-3 reagents, calibrators, and QC materials
into the analyzer following the manufacturer's instructions.
◦ Perform calibration using the provided calibrators. Accept
the calibration if results are within the acceptable range
provided by the manufacturer.
2. Quality Control:
◦ Run two levels of QC material (low and high) at the start of
each testing shift and after every 20 patient samples.
◦ Verify that QC results fall within the manufacturer's
acceptable ranges before proceeding with patient samples.
◦ Document QC results in the QC log.
3. Sample Analysis:
◦ Load prepared patient samples into the analyzer.
◦ Enter or verify patient/sample identification data in the
laboratory information system (LIS) or analyzer as per
laboratory protocol.
◦ Initiate the analysis run and wait for the completion of the
assay.
◦ Review the results generated by the analyzer.
Troubleshooting:
• If QC results are outside acceptable ranges, re-run the QC. If still
out of range, troubleshoot according to the analyzer's manual or
contact technical support.
• If a patient sample result is flagged by the analyzer, re-run the
sample. If the issue persists, check for sample integrity and
consider requesting a new specimen.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Review and verify all patient results in the LIS.
• Ensure flagged or suspicious results are validated with re-testing
and appropriate comment inclusion.
• Transmit verified results to the healthcare provider or electronic
medical record system.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Normal Range: Typically, CA 15-3 levels are considered normal
when they are below 30 U/mL, though this may vary slightly
depending on the specific method and assay.
1. QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE
• Perform quality control as per section 4.2.
• Participate in external proficiency testing programs to ensure
assay accuracy.
• Maintain documentation of all quality control and proficiency
testing results.
1. SAFETY AND WASTE DISPOSAL
• Follow universal precautions and wear appropriate PPE at all
times.
• Dispose of biological and chemical waste according to laboratory
safety protocols and local regulations.
