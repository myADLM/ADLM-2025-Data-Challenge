Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for the Analytical Phase
of Generating Results for Cancer Antigen 15-3 (CA 15-3), Serum
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedure for the analytical
phase of CA 15-3 testing in serum, ensuring accurate, precise, and
timely results.
1. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel performing CA
15-3 testing on patient serum samples.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
• Laboratory technologists are responsible for performing the CA
15-3 assay according to this SOP.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring staff competency and
compliance with this SOP.
1. REAGENTS, EQUIPMENT, AND MATERIALS
• Automated immunoassay analyzer (e.g., Roche Cobas, Siemens
Dimension, etc.)
• CA 15-3 reagent kits, calibration kits, and control materials
specific to the analyzer being used.
• Calibrators and quality control materials approved for CA 15-3
testing.
• Serum separator tubes (SST) or plain red-top tubes for sample
collection.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred specimen: 5 mL of serum.
• Specimen must be centrifuged and separated from the clot within
2 hours of collection.
• Serum samples should be stored at 2-8°C for up to 48 hours. For
longer storage, serum should be frozen at -20°C.
1. PROCEDURE
A) Specimen Preparation
• Verify that the specimen meets acceptance criteria: proper
labeling, appropriate volume, and absence of hemolysis, icterus,
or lipemia. Reject and request a new sample if criteria are not
met.
• Allow the serum to reach room temperature before analysis if it
was refrigerated or frozen.
B) Calibration
• Perform calibration of the analyzer using the CA 15-3 calibration
kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
• Document calibration data according to laboratory policy.
C) Quality Control
• Run internal quality control materials at least once per shift, after
calibration, or after any major maintenance.
• Review and document control results. If QC results are outside
acceptable limits, troubleshoot according to the analyzer’s
operational manual, and do not proceed with patient testing until
QC results are within acceptable limits.
D) Sample Analysis
• Load patient serum samples onto the automated immunoassay
analyzer.
• Follow analyzer-specific instructions for CA 15-3 testing.
• Review preliminary results for flags or errors. Repeat testing if
necessary.
E) Result Verification
• Review results for consistency and accuracy. Compare with
previous patient results if available.
• Verify results according to laboratory guidelines before releasing
to the LIS (Laboratory Information System).
1. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
• Reference Range: <30 U/mL (note: reference ranges may vary
based on the assay and population; adjust as required).
• Elevations in CA 15-3 levels may indicate breast cancer
progression or metastasis but are not diagnostic on their own.
Clinical correlation with other diagnostic procedures is essential.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Enter verified results into the LIS.
• Alert the ordering physician of critical or significantly elevated
results as per laboratory policy.
1. QUALITY CONTROL AND MONITORING
• Document all QC activities, calibration records, and maintenance
logs.
• Participate in external quality assessment programs to ensure the
accuracy and reliability of CA 15-3 testing.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING
• Refer to the analyzer’s troubleshooting guide and CA 15-3
reagent kit insert for resolving issues.
• Document all troubleshooting steps taken in the maintenance log.
1. REFERENCE MATERIALS
• Manufacturer’s package insert for CA 15-3 reagent kits.
• User manual for the specific immunoassay analyzer used.
1. REVISIONS AND DOCUMENT CONTROL
• This SOP is reviewed annually and revised as necessary by the
laboratory supervisor.
By following this SOP, laboratory personnel will ensure accurate,
consistent, and timely generation of CA 15-3 serum test results,
providing valuable information for the clinical management of
patients.
