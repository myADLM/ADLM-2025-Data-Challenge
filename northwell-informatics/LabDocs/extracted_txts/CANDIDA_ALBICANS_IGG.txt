SOP: Analysis for Candida Albicans IgG
1. PURPOSE
To ensure accurate and reliable results for Candida Albicans IgG
testing, including appropriate procedures for the use of analytical
instruments and reagents, handling and processing of specimens,
and reporting of results.
Responsibility: Laboratory technologists are responsible for the
execution of this protocol. Supervisors are responsible for overseeing
the process, troubleshooting discrepancies and ensuring training
compliance.
1. DEFINITION
Candida Albicans IgG: Immunoglobulin G antibodies specific to
Candida Albicans used to monitor or diagnose fungal infections.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Requirements:
1. Acceptable Specimens:
• Serum: Obtain 5 mL of blood in a serum separator tube (SST). Allow the blood to clot for 30 minutes at room temperature, then centrifuge at 1,500 x g for 10 minutes to separate serum.
• Plasma: Use EDTA or heparinized vacutainer tubes.
2. Unacceptable Specimens:
• Grossly hemolyzed, lipemic or icteric samples.
• Specimens collected in sodium citrate or fluoride tubes.
B. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies:
1. Equipment:
• ELISA Reader.
• Centrifuge.
• Micropipettes (various ranges).
• Timer.
2. Reagents and Supplies:
• Candida Albicans IgG ELISA kit (store according to manufacturer’s specifications).
• Pipette tips.
• Disposable gloves.
• Serological control samples (Positive and Negative controls).
C. Preparation:
1. Allow all reagents and specimens to come to room temperature before analysis.
2. Follow the ELISA kit insert for detailed preparation of reagents including wash solution, conjugate, and substrate.
D. Analytical Testing:
1. Pipetting:
• Pipette 100 µL of each sample, calibrator, control, and blank into appropriate wells in duplicate.
• Ensure accurate pipetting to avoid cross-contamination.
2. Incubation:
• Incubate the reaction wells according to the manufacturer’s instructions (e.g., 37°C for 30 minutes).
3. Wash Steps:
• Wash the wells according to manufacturer’s instructions, typically three times with the provided wash solution.
4. Substrate Addition:
• Add the specified volume of substrate solution to each well.
• Incubate in the dark for the specified duration (e.g., 20 minutes at room temperature).
5. Stop Reaction:
• Add stop solution to each well (usually sulfuric or phosphoric acid).
• Gently tap the plate to mix.
E. Reading:
1. Measure absorbance immediately using an ELISA reader at a specified wavelength (e.g., 450 nm).
2. Record the optical density (OD) values for all samples, controls, and calibrators.
F. Calculation and Interpretation:
1. Plot the calibrators' OD values against their concentrations to draw a standard curve.
2. Determine the concentration of Candida Albicans IgG in patient samples by comparing the OD values to the standard curve.
Reference Intervals:
- Negative: <xxx IU/mL (Refer to the kit insert for specific cut-offs)
- Positive: ≥ xxx IU/mL (Based on kit-specific cut-offs)
G. Quality Control:
1. Run both positive and negative controls with each batch of tests.
2. Document the results in the Quality Control Log.
3. Compare the control results to established ranges for validation.
4. If controls fall outside their established ranges, do not report patient results until the issue is resolved.
H. Reporting Results:
1. Transmit results to the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
2. Verify results before releasing to ensure all QC requirements are met.
3. Communicate critical values to the clinician immediately, as per laboratory protocol.
I. Troubleshooting:
1. If unexpected values or errors occur, recheck pipetting techniques and reagent expiration dates.
2. Review incubation times and temperature conditions for accuracy.
3. Repeat the assay if necessary, and notify the supervisor if issues persist.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the manufacturer’s instructions for limitations related to
reagent stability and assay sensitivity. Note instances of cross-
reactivity and interference that may affect results.
