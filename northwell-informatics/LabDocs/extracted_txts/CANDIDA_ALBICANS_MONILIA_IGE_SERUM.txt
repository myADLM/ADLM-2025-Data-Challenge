Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for CANDIDA ALBICANS (MONILIA), IGE,
SERUM
1. PURPOSE
The aim of this SOP is to provide a standardized procedure for the
analytical phase of generating results for Candida albicans (Monilia),
IgE in serum samples. This procedure ensures accurate, reliable, and
reproducible results.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory staff are responsible for following this SOP
to analyze serum samples for Candida albicans (Monilia), IgE.
• It is the responsibility of all laboratory personnel to identify any
deficiencies in the process that may affect test results and to
inform a supervisor.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring adherence to the
procedures and for addressing any corrective actions as needed.
1. DEFINITION
Candida albicans (Monilia), IgE: This refers to specific
immunoglobulin E antibodies directed against the Candida albicans
yeast, measured in serum to assess allergic responses.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) reader
• ELISA kit for Candida albicans (Monilia), IgE
• Micropipettes and tips (20-200 µL, 100-1000 µL)
• Calibrated timers
• Microplates
• Wash buffer
• Substrate solution
• Stop solution
• Distilled or deionized water
• Absorbent paper
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation
1. Wear appropriate PPE including lab coat, gloves, and eye
protection.
2. Set up the ELISA reader and ensure it is calibrated according to
the manufacturer’s guidelines.
3. Bring all reagents and samples to room temperature before
beginning the assay.
4. Prepare wash buffer and other reagents according to the
instructions provided in the kit.
B. Sample Preparation
1. Ensure that serum samples have been stored properly and are
thawed to room temperature before testing.
2. Mix samples by gentle inversion or briefly vortex.
C. Running the Assay
1. Pipette blank, standards, controls, and serum samples into the
designated wells of the microplate as indicated in the ELISA kit
protocol.
2. Incubate the microplate for the specified time at the
recommended temperature according to the kit instructions.
3. Wash the wells thoroughly with the prepared wash buffer,
usually three times or more as specified by the kit protocol.
4. Add the enzyme conjugate to each well and incubate for the
specified time at the recommended temperature.
5. Wash the wells thoroughly again with the wash buffer.
6. Add the substrate solution to each well and incubate for the
specified time in the dark.
7. Add the stop solution to each well to terminate the reaction.
D. Measuring and Recording Results
1. Place the microplate into the ELISA reader and measure the
absorbance at the appropriate wavelength (typically 450 nm).
2. Use the ELISA reader’s software to generate the standard
curve and calculate the concentration of Candida albicans
(Monilia), IgE in each sample based on their absorbance
values.
3. Review the results to ensure they are within the acceptable
range for quality control.
E. Quality Control
1. Include internal quality control samples with each run to ensure
the assay is performing correctly.
2. Acceptable ranges for control samples should be established
before routine use and adhered to for ongoing validation.
3. Record any deviations and implement corrective actions if
control results are outside the acceptable range.
F. Reporting Results
1. Review calculated results to ensure they make clinical sense
and are free of any apparent technical errors.
2. Enter the validated results into the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
3. Ensure that all results are verified by a qualified technologist
before being reported out.
G. Documentation
1. Document all procedures, calibrations, maintenance, and
quality control measures in the appropriate logs.
2. Ensure that all logs are complete, accurate, and up-to-date.
3. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the specific ELISA kit insert for any limitations related to the
individual reagent components and overall method sensitivity and
specificity.

instructions and information.
1. APPENDICES
• Example templates for recording temperature logs, quality control
results, and maintenance records.
By following this SOP, laboratory personnel can ensure that the
process of generating results for Candida albicans (Monilia), IgE in
serum is carried out accurately and consistently, maintaining high
standards of laboratory practice.
