Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for CANDIDA AURIS
SURVEILLANCE, MOLECULAR DETECTION, PCR, VARIES
1. PURPOSE
This SOP delineates the procedures for the molecular detection
and PCR analysis of Candida auris in various clinical
specimens. These guidelines aim to ensure accurate, reliable,
and reproducible results for C. auris surveillance.
2. SCOPE
This procedure is applicable to all laboratory personnel trained
in molecular diagnostics and PCR techniques and will be used
for surveillance and detection of C. auris in clinical specimens
such as swabs, urine, blood, and other bodily fluids.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of trained laboratory personnel to:
◦ Prepare samples and reagents according to the established
protocol.
◦ Perform molecular detection and PCR assays.
◦ Document, analyze, and validate results.
◦ Perform quality control and ensure compliance with CLIA
regulations.
◦ Report any anomalies or equipment malfunctions to the
supervisor.
4. DEFINITIONS
◦ PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction): A technique used to
amplify DNA segments.
◦ C. auris: A species of fungus that can cause infections.
◦ Surveillance: Monitoring the occurrence of C. auris in
clinical specimens.
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
◦ Acceptable Specimens: Swabs, blood, urine, and other
bodily fluids.
◦ Specimen Collection: Specimens should be collected in
sterile containers and transported to the laboratory
immediately. Store at 2-8°C if there is any delay in
processing.
6. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
◦ PCR Thermal Cycler
◦ Centrifuge
◦ Vortex
◦ Micropipettes and tips
◦ DNA extraction kits
◦ PCR master mix
◦ Candida auris specific primers and probes
◦ Nuclease-free water
◦ Personal protective equipment (PPE)
7. PROCEDURE
A) DNA Extraction
◦ Label all tubes and preparation areas.
◦ Use the appropriate DNA extraction kit for the specimen
type.
◦ Follow the manufacturer's protocol for DNA isolation.
◦ Measure the DNA concentration using a nanodrop or
equivalent device.
◦ Store extracted DNA at -20°C until PCR analysis.
B) PCR Setup
◦ Thaw all reagents and DNA samples on ice.
◦ Prepare the PCR master mix in a designated clean area to
prevent contamination.
◦ The typical PCR mix (25 µL) comprises:
▪ 12.5 µL PCR master mix
▪ 1 µL forward primer (10µM)
▪ 1 µL reverse primer (10µM)
▪ 1 µL probe (10µM)
▪ 5.5 µL nuclease-free water
▪ 5 µL DNA template
◦ Mix gently and aliquot the PCR mix to labeled PCR tubes or
plates.
C) PCR Cycling Conditions
◦ Load the tubes or plates into the PCR thermal cycler.
◦ Set the cycling conditions as follows:
▪ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 10 minutes
▪ 40 cycles:
▪ Denaturation: 95°C for 15 seconds
▪ Annealing and extension: 60°C for 1 minute
D) Post-PCR Handling
◦ At the end of the amplification, transfer the plate to a post-
PCR area for analysis.
◦ Use a real-time PCR detection system to interpret the
results.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Include positive and negative controls in each run.
◦ Record and monitor the performance using QC charts.
◦ Any deviation from expected results should be investigated,
documented, and reported to the supervisor.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ Analyze and review the amplification plots and threshold
cycles (Ct values).
◦ Positive Result: Ct values within the specifed range and
consistent with controls.
◦ Negative Result: No amplification within the designated
cycle number.
◦ Indeterminate Result: Require retesting if control fails or
results are ambiguous.
◦ All results should be entered into the Laboratory Information
System (LIS) and verified by the supervising technologist.
10. REFERENCE INTERVALS
◦ Report positive C. auris detection as "Detected."
◦ Negative detection should be reported as "Not Detected."
11. METHOD LIMITATIONS
◦ False positives or negatives may occur due to
contamination or improper specimen handling.
◦ Ensure extraction and amplification efficiency.
