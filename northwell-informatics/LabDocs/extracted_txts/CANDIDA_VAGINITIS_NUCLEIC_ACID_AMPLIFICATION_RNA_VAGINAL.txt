Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for
Analytical Phase of Generating Results for
Candida Vaginitis, Nucleic Acid
Amplification RNA, Vaginal
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to ensure the standardized,
consistent, and accurate analytical processing of samples for
the detection of Candida vaginitis using nucleic acid
amplification techniques. The RNA analysis will follow precise
laboratory protocols to generate validated results that are
clinically reliable.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory technologists are responsible for
adhering to this protocol. Supervisors are responsible for
ensuring that staff are trained and competent to perform the
test, and that all quality control measures are followed.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
◦ Type: Vaginal swab specimen
◦ Collection Medium: Utilize collection tube containing viral
transport medium (VTM) or sterile saline solution.
◦ Volume: Sufficient to submerge the swab tip
◦ Transport Conditions: Transport the specimen to the
laboratory at 2-8°C within 72 hours of collection.
Note: Reject specimens that are not properly labeled, leak, or
are collected using incorrect tools.
4. REAGENTS, EQUIPMENT, AND SUPPLIES
◦ RNA extraction kits
◦ qPCR or RT-PCR reagents and enzymes
◦ qPCR or RT-PCR machines with appropriate software
◦ Nuclease-free tubes and pipette tips
◦ Vortex mixer
◦ Centrifuge
◦ Micropipettes
◦ Personal protective equipment (PPE)
5. PREPROCEDURE STEPS
◦ Don appropriate PPE including lab coat, gloves, and face
shield.
◦ Ensure all reagents and equipment are at room temperature
unless specified otherwise.
◦ Prepare workbench with all required materials.
6. PROTOCOL
A) RNA Extraction:
i. Preparation:
◦ Label all microcentrifuge tubes and necessary
consumables.
◦ Prepare the workstation inside a biosafety cabinet if dealing
with potentially infectious material.
ii. Extraction:
◦ Add the swab specimen to the lysis buffer provided in the
extraction kit and vortex briefly.
◦ Follow the RNA extraction kit manufacturer's protocol for
purification steps.
iii. Quality Control:
◦ Include RNA quality and concentration checks using a
spectrophotometer or fluorometer.
B) Nucleic Acid Amplification:
i. Preparation of Master Mix:
◦ Prepare the master mix as per the manufacturer's
instructions which include primers, probes, nucleotides,
enzymes, and the reaction buffer.
◦ Include negative controls (no template control) and positive
controls in each run.
ii. Setup for Amplification:
◦ Distribute master mix into each well of a PCR plate.
◦ Add extracted RNA samples, positive control, and negative
control to appropriate wells.
◦ Seal the PCR plate and ensure there are no air bubbles.
iii. PCR Cycling:
◦ Load the PCR plate into the PCR machine.
◦ Set the cycling conditions as recommended by the kit's
protocol, typically involving reverse transcription at 50-55°C
for 10-30 minutes, initial denaturation at 95°C for 2-5
minutes, followed by 40-45 cycles of denaturation at 95°C
for 10-15 seconds, and annealing/extension at 60°C for
30-60 seconds.
C) Analyzing Results:
i. Data Analysis:
◦ Software on the PCR machine will automatically generate
amplification curves.
◦ Verify the results by examining Ct values and ensuring
controls meet expected criteria.
ii. Interpretation:
◦ According to established thresholds, determine the
presence or absence of Candida RNA.
◦ Assign qualitative results (positive/negative) based on Ct
value cutoff as defined.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Ensure all procedures are followed exactly as described in
the manufacturer’s kit instructions.
◦ Perform routine equipment maintenance and calibration.
◦ Process internal quality controls with every batch run to
validate results accuracy.
◦ Any deviation or quality control failure should be recorded
and reported to the supervisor immediately.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ Document the results in the laboratory information system
(LIS).
◦ Verify all results before reporting.
◦ Communicate critical or unusual outcomes to the requesting
clinician as per lab guidelines.
9. REFERENCES
◦ Manufacturer’s instructions for RNA Extraction Kit and PCR
Reagents.
◦ Laboratory safety and quality assurance protocols.
◦ Relevant clinical and diagnostic guidelines from authoritative
sources.
10. REVIEW AND REVISION LOG
• This SOP should be reviewed annually or as required.
• Document any amendments or updates with dates and staff
initials.
By following this systematic SOP, the laboratory ensures accurate
identification of Candida vaginitis through nucleic acid amplification
RNA techniques, supporting timely and effective patient
management.
