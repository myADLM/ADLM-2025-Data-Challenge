Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Candida (Yeast) Culture
1. PURPOSE:
To provide a standardized protocol for the isolation, identification,
analysis, and reporting of Candida species in clinical specimens.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of all trained laboratory personnel to adhere to
this protocol and follow all guidelines for the accurate and timely
processing of specimens for the identification of Candida species.
Supervisors are responsible for reviewing and verifying results prior
to the release of patient reports.
1. DEFINITION:
Candida cultures are performed to isolate and identify the presence
of Candida species in clinical specimens. This can aid in the
diagnosis of candidiasis and guide appropriate antifungal therapy.
1. PROCEDURE:
Specimens Accepted:
• Blood
• Urine
• Respiratory specimens (sputum, bronchial lavage)
• Swabs from specific body sites (e.g., oral, vaginal, skin)
• Tissue biopsies
• Other clinical specimens as justified by clinical necessity
Specimen Preparation and Inoculation:
1. Specimen Handling:
◦ Ensure all specimens are within acceptable transport time
and conditions as specified in laboratory guidelines.
◦ Vortex swab specimens in 0.5 mL of sterile saline if
necessary to disperse the sample.
◦ Depending on the specimen type, concentrate it by
centrifugation or use the neat sample for inoculation.
2. Media Inoculation:
◦ Blood agar plate for initial inoculation.
◦ Sabouraud Dextrose Agar (SDA) with Chloramphenicol to
inhibit bacterial growth.
◦ Chromogenic Agars (e.g., CHROMagar Candida) to
facilitate yeast species identification.
3. Culture Conditions:
◦ Incubate plates at 35-37°C in an aerobic environment.
Monitor daily for growth.
4. Examination and Subculture:
◦ Examine plates daily for growth. Note colony morphology,
color, and characteristics.
◦ Perform a Gram stain to check for yeast cells.
◦ Subculture suspected colonies to fresh media to isolate pure
colonies if multiple colony types are present.
5. IDENTIFICATION:
6. Microscopic Examination:
◦ Perform a wet mount or Gram stain for initial observation of
yeast cells.
7. Biochemical Tests:
◦ Utilize API 20C AUX or Vitek 2 YST for yeast identification
based on carbohydrate assimilation patterns.
8. Molecular Methods (if applicable):
◦ Perform PCR-based assays if rapid identification is needed
and available.
9. MALDI-TOF MS (if applicable):
◦ Use matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight
mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) for the rapid
identification of yeast isolates if available and validated in
your laboratory.
10. Antifungal Susceptibility Testing:
◦ Refer to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI)
guidelines for antifungal susceptibility testing of Candida
species.
◦ Utilize commercial systems (e.g., Sensititre YeastOne, Vitek
2 AST) or broth microdilution methods.
11. QUALITY CONTROL:
12. Media and Reagent QC:
◦ Perform regular quality control for media and reagents
according to laboratory standards.
13. Equipment Calibration:
◦ Calibrate incubators, analyzers, and other critical equipment
as per manufacturer’s guidelines and laboratory protocols.
14. Internal QC Strains:
◦ Use control strains (e.g., Candida albicans ATCC 90028) to
validate test performance and ensure consistent result
quality.
15. REPORTING RESULTS:
16. Documentation:
◦ Record all observations, results of identification tests, and
susceptibly tests comprehensively in the laboratory
information system (LIS).
17. Result Verification:
◦ Supervisors must verify results and confirm that all criteria
for species identification and susceptibility testing are met.
◦ Ensure any critical results, including resistant organisms,
are communicated immediately to the relevant healthcare
provider.
18. Final Report:
◦ The laboratory report should include the exact species
identification, any colony counts (if applicable), and results
of susceptibility tests.
◦ Provide interpretive comments as necessary for clinical
relevance and guidance.
19. STORAGE AND DISPOSAL:
20. Specimen and Isolate Retention:
◦ Store primary specimens and isolates as indicated by lab
policy until result verification and reporting are complete.
21. Biohazard Disposal:
◦ Dispose of all biohazardous materials, including used
culture plates and reagents, following laboratory safety
protocols and governmental regulations.
