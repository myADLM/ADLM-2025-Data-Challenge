Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Cannabidiol, Serum
1. PURPOSE
To provide detailed and standardized instructions for the analysis and
reporting of Cannabidiol (CBD) concentrations in serum samples.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all personnel involved in the analytical phase of
testing for Cannabidiol, encompassing sample preparation,
instrument calibration, analysis, quality control, and result reporting.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of trained laboratory personnel to adhere to this
procedure to ensure accurate and reliable test results. Supervisors
must ensure compliance and address any issues or deviations.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen Type: Serum.
Collection:
• Serum should be collected in a serum separator tube (SST) or a
red-top tube without additives.
• Allow the blood to clot for 30 minutes at room temperature and
then centrifuge for 10 minutes at 1500 x g.
Storage:
• Extracted serum should be stored at -20°C for short-term storage
(up to 7 days) or -80°C for long-term storage (up to 6 months).
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed samples.
• Specimens not properly labeled.
• Specimens with prolonged clotting time (>2 hours before
centrifugation).
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)
system.
• Centrifuge.
• Micropipettes and tips.
• Vortex mixer.
• Serological pipettes.
Reagents:
• Certified Cannabidiol standard.
• Internal standard (e.g., Deuterated Cannabidiol).
• Mobile phase A: Water with 0.1% formic acid.
• Mobile phase B: Acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid.
• Sample preparation solvents: Methanol and Acetonitrile.
• Calibration standards and quality control samples.
Supplies:
• Assay plates.
• Sample vials.
• Syringes and filters.
• Calibration curve records.
6. PROCEDURE
A. Calibration and Quality Control:
1. Calibration Curve Preparation:
◦ Prepare a series of Cannabidiol standard solutions in the
range of 2 – 200 ng/mL.
◦ Prepare at least five calibration standards and three quality
control (QC) levels (low, medium, high).
2. Quality Control Preparation:
◦ Prepare QC samples at three concentration levels (low,
medium, and high).
◦ Store QC samples in aliquots at -20°C.
B. Sample Preparation:
1. Serum Extraction:
◦ Pipette 200 µL of serum into a clean sample vial.
◦ Add 50 µL of internal standard (e.g., Deuterated
Cannabidiol).
◦ Add 1 mL of cold acetonitrile to precipitate proteins.
◦ Vortex the mixture for 1 minute.
◦ Centrifuge at 1500 x g for 10 minutes.
◦ Transfer the supernatant to a new vial and evaporate to
dryness under a nitrogen stream.
2. Reconstitution:
◦ Reconstitute the dried residue in 200 µL of mobile phase
(Water:Acetonitrile, 50:50).
◦ Vortex and transfer to autosampler vial for LC-MS/MS
analysis.
C. Instrumentation Setup:
1. LC-MS/MS Conditions:
◦ Column: C18 column, 2.1 x 50 mm, 1.7 µm particle size.
◦ Mobile phase A: Water with 0.1% formic acid.
◦ Mobile phase B: Acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid.
◦ Injection volume: 10 µL.
◦ Flow rate: 0.4 mL/min.
◦ Gradient elution: Start at 70% B, increase to 95% B over 3
minutes, hold for 2 minutes, return to initial conditions.
2. MS Conditions:
◦ Ionization mode: Positive electrospray ionization (ESI).
◦ Monitoring: Multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) for
Cannabidiol and internal standard.
D. Analysis:
1. Calibration and QC Samples:
◦ Run the calibration standards and QC samples at the
beginning of the batch and after every 10 patient samples.
◦ Ensure calibration curve shows linearity with r^2 > 0.995.
2. Patient Samples:
◦ Inject prepared patient serum samples sequentially.
◦ Record retention times, peak areas, and MRM transitions.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Evaluate QC results for each batch.
• Assessment criteria: QC results should be within ±15% of nominal
values.
• Perform troubleshooting if QC results fall outside acceptable
limits, reanalyze if needed.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Analyze data using the instrument's software.
• Calculate sample concentrations using the calibration curve.
• Review and validate results following laboratory guidelines.
• Document the final results in the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
9. DOCUMENTATION AND RECORD-KEEPING
• Maintain all calibration and QC records, including raw data and
processed results, for a minimum of 2 years.
• Document any deviations from the SOP and corrective actions
taken.
