Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Cannabinoids Screen, Urine
1. PURPOSE To establish a standard procedure for the analysis
of cannabinoids in urine specimens using an immunoassay
screening method.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory staff are responsible for
following this procedure. Supervisors are responsible for ensuring the
procedure is followed and for addressing any deviations.
1. SPECIMEN Preferred/Acceptable:
• 10 mL freshly collected urine in a sterile container.
• Specimens must be labeled with patient identification and
collection date/time.
• Specimens should be tested within 72 hours of collection. If
storage is necessary, refrigerate the sample at 2-8°C.
Unacceptable:
• Specimens without proper labeling (patient identification,
collection date/time).
• Specimens that are more than 72 hours old without refrigeration
or proper preservation.
• Specimens that have been subjected to extreme temperatures or
left at room temperature for prolonged periods.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• Immunoassay Analyzer (e.g., Beckman Coulter AU5800)
• Cannabinoid reagent kits with calibrators and controls
• Calibration and control solutions
• Disposable pipettes and tips
• Urine cups
1. PROCEDURE
2. Prepare the Work Area
◦ Ensure all reagents, controls, and calibrators are within
expiry dates and have been stored as per manufacturer
guidelines.
◦ Calibrate the Immunoassay Analyzer according to the
manufacturer’s instructions using the provided calibrator
solutions.
3. Sample Preparation
◦ Mix urine specimens well before analysis.
◦ Aliquot 5 mL of the urine sample into a disposable cup if
necessary.
4. Quality Control
◦ Run both negative and positive controls before beginning
patient sample analysis.
◦ Ensure control results fall within established acceptable
ranges. Document control results in the Quality Control Log.
◦ If control results are outside the acceptable ranges,
troubleshoot and resolve issues before proceeding with
patient samples. Notify supervisor if necessary.
5. Analysis
◦ Place urine samples in the designated sample rack of the
Immunoassay Analyzer.
◦ Program the analyzer with patient identification and test
information.
◦ Initiate the analysis process according to the analyzer’s user
manual.
◦ The analyzer will automatically calculate and display the
concentration of cannabinoids based on the calibration
curve.
6. Result Interpretation and Validation
◦ Results from the analyzer will be recorded automatically in
the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
◦ Review and verify results. Ensure all controls are within
range before validating patient results.
◦ Positive screening results should be confirmed with a
secondary method such as Gas Chromatography-Mass
Spectrometry (GC-MS).
7. Reporting Results
◦ Document and communicate results according to laboratory
policy.
◦ For positive results, indicate "Preliminary positive;
confirmation pending" until confirmed by GC-MS.
◦ Enter the final results into the LIS after confirmation, if
necessary.
8. CLEANING AND MAINTENANCE
◦ Perform daily, weekly, and monthly maintenance checks as
recommended by the analyzer’s manufacturer.
◦ Clean and disinfect the work area after the completion of the
analysis.
◦ Dispose of all waste according to biohazard and chemical
waste disposal regulations.
9. TROUBLESHOOTING
◦ Refer to the analyzer’s troubleshooting guide for issues
related to instrument errors.
◦ Repeat analysis with a fresh aliquot of specimen if any
errors occur.
◦ If problems persist, contact technical support for the
analyzer and notify the supervisor.
10. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Document all quality control activities, maintenance, and
any corrective actions taken in the appropriate logs.
◦ Participate in proficiency testing programs to ensure the
accuracy and reliability of test results.
11. REFERENCES
◦ Manufacturer’s instructions for the Immunoassay Analyzer
and reagent kits.
◦ Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI)
guidelines for urine drug testing.
12. DOCUMENTATION
◦ Record all pertinent information including patient
identification, specimen condition, analyzer settings, quality
control results, and any deviations from the SOP in the
laboratory records.
◦ Maintain accurate logs for temperature monitoring of
storage areas, calibration dates, maintenance activities, and
proficiency testing results.
This protocol must be reviewed annually and updated as necessary
to ensure compliance with current guidelines and standards.
