Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Analytical Phase
of Generating Results for Cannabinoids, Umbilical
Cord Tissue
1. PURPOSE
To detail the procedure for the analytical phase of generating
accurate and reliable results for cannabinoids in umbilical cord tissue
samples in compliance with regulatory standards and laboratory best
practices.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for executing and
documenting all steps of the analytical procedure as outlined below.
Laboratory supervisors are responsible for ensuring adherence to the
protocol and for addressing any issues that may arise during the
analysis.
3. SCOPE
This SOP covers the analytical process for detecting and quantifying
cannabinoids in umbilical cord tissue samples using the designated
instrumentation and methodologies.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Equipment: Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/
MS) system
• Reagents: Calibration standards, quality control (QC) samples,
mobile phase solvents, extraction solvents, internal standards
• Supplies: Pipettes, centrifuge, homogenizer, extraction tubes,
cord tissue containers
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Collection: Umbilical cord tissue collected immediately after birth,
stored in provided containers, and transported to the laboratory
within 48 hours.
• Storage: Store samples at -20°C until analysis.
• Unacceptable Specimens: Samples that are not stored correctly,
improperly labeled, or contaminated.
6. PROCEDURE
A) PRE-ANALYSIS
1. Receipt and Documentation:
◦ Confirm specimen identity and integrity upon receipt.
◦ Log specimen details in laboratory information system (LIS).
2. Preparation:
◦ Thaw the umbilical cord tissue samples at room
temperature.
◦ Cut approximately 1 g of umbilical cord tissue using sterile
scissors/scalpel.
◦ Homogenize tissue in an appropriate volume of phosphate-
buffered saline (PBS) using a homogenizer.
B) EXTRACTION
1. Extraction Process:
◦ Transfer homogenized tissue to extraction tubes.
◦ Add internal standards and extraction solvents according to
validated protocols.
◦ Vortex samples thoroughly for 2-3 minutes.
◦ Centrifuge extracts at 4000 rpm for 10 minutes at 4°C.
◦ Collect the supernatant and transfer to clean tubes.
2. Concentration:
◦ Evaporate solvents under nitrogen flow at 40°C.
◦ Reconstitute samples in mobile phase before analysis.
C) INSTRUMENT SETUP
• LC-MS/MS Instrumentation:
◦ Calibrate LC-MS/MS system using cannabinoids calibration
standards.
◦ Prepare and run QC samples to verify the system
performance.
◦ Set mobile phase gradient: (e.g., 0.1% formic acid in water
and acetonitrile)
D) ANALYSIS
1. Injection:
◦ Inject prepared samples into the LC-MS/MS system.
◦ Each batch must include calibration standards, QC samples,
and blanks.
2. Detection and Quantification:
◦ Detect cannabinoids using specific MS/MS transitions.
◦ Quantify cannabinoids concentrations using calibration
curves.
E) POST-ANALYSIS
1. Data Review:
◦ Review generated chromatograms and mass spectra for
peak integrity.
◦ Verify that QC sample results fall within specified limits.
2. Result Validation:
◦ Validate results using LIS.
◦ Flag and investigate any outliers or anomalies.
◦ Perform any necessary repeat analyses based on initial
findings.
F) REPORTING
1. Documentation:
◦ Document final results in the LIS.
◦ Include notes on any troubleshooting or corrective actions
taken.
2. Transmission:
◦ Prepare final report for review by laboratory supervisors.
◦ Transmit validated results to medical personnel using
authorized channels.
7. QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE
• Run QC samples at the beginning and end of each analysis
batch.
• Perform regular calibration and maintenance checks on the LC-
MS/MS system.
• Follow up on deviations and non-conformances as per laboratory
policy.
