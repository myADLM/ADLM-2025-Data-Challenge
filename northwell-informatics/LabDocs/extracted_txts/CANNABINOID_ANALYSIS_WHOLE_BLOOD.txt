Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Cannabinoid Analysis in
Whole Blood
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to provide standardized guidelines
for the analytical phase of generating results for Cannabinoid
Analysis in Whole Blood. This procedure ensures accuracy,
precision, and compliance with regulatory standards.
1. SCOPE
This procedure applies to the analysis of whole blood for
cannabinoids, including but not limited to Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol
(THC), 11-nor-9-carboxy-Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC-COOH), and
other related metabolites.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
All laboratory personnel performing cannabinoid testing are
responsible for adhering to this SOP. It is the responsibility of the
laboratory supervisor to ensure that all staff are trained in this
procedure and that it is followed correctly.
1. DEFINITIONS
THC - Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol, the psychoactive component of
cannabis. THC-COOH - 11-nor-9-carboxy-Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol, a
metabolite of THC.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Whole blood specimens must be collected in gray-top tubes
containing sodium fluoride/potassium oxalate.
• Specimens should be stored at 2-8°C and analyzed within 7 days
of collection. If longer storage is required, specimens should be
frozen at -20°C or lower.
• Unacceptable specimens: hemolyzed, clotted, or improperly
labeled samples.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Gas Chromatograph/Mass Spectrometer (GC/MS) or Liquid
Chromatograph/Tandem Mass Spectrometer (LC/MS-MS)
• Calibrators and controls specific for THC and THC-COOH
analysis
• Methanol, acetonitrile, and other HPLC-grade solvents
• Solid-phase extraction (SPE) cartridges
• Certified reference materials for THC and THC-COOH
• Analyte-free whole blood (used for calibration and quality control)
1. PROCEDURE
A) Calibration and Quality Control
• Prepare calibrators using certified reference materials at
concentrations ranging from 0 to 100 ng/mL for THC and THC-
COOH.
• Prepare quality control samples at low, medium, and high
concentrations (10 ng/mL, 50 ng/mL, and 100 ng/mL).
• Analyze calibrators and quality control samples before, during,
and after the batch of patient specimens to ensure accuracy.
B) Sample Preparation
• Thaw the whole blood specimens at room temperature if frozen.
• Vortex the specimen to ensure homogeneity.
• Pipette 1 mL of the specimen into a labeled centrifuge tube.
• Add 1 mL of cold acetonitrile to the tube to promote protein
precipitation.
• Vortex and centrifuge at 3000 RPM for 10 minutes at 4°C.
• Transfer the supernatant to a clean tube and dilute with
phosphate buffer (pH 7.4).
• Perform solid-phase extraction (SPE) using conditioned
cartridges:
◦ Condition SPE cartridge with 3 mL methanol followed by 3 mL
water.
◦ Load the sample onto the cartridge.
◦ Wash with 3 mL water followed by 3 mL acetonitrile.
◦ Elute the cannabinoids with 2 mL of methanol.
C) Instrumental Analysis
• Inject 10 µL of the extract into the GC/MS or LC/MS-MS.
• Set the instrument parameters according to the manufacturer's
instructions for detecting THC and THC-COOH.
◦ Suggested GC/MS settings:
▪ Injector temperature: 250°C
▪ Oven temperature program: initial 100°C, hold for 1 min;
ramp at 25°C/min to 250°C, hold for 5 min.
▪ MS settings: selective ion monitoring (SIM) mode for THC
and THC-COOH ions.
◦ Suggested LC/MS-MS settings:
▪ Mobile phase: gradient of methanol and water with 0.1%
formic acid.
▪ Column temperature: 40°C.
▪ MS settings: multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode for
THC and THC-COOH transitions.
D) Data Analysis and Reporting
• Review chromatograms and mass spectra. Verify the retention
times and ion ratios.
• Calculate the concentration of THC and THC-COOH in the
samples using the calibration curve.
• Quality control results must fall within ±15% of the target
concentrations.
• Validate the batch if all controls are within acceptable limits. If not,
investigate and rerun the batch if necessary.
• Report results in nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL). Include a
comment if the sample integrity or quality control criteria are not
met.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run quality control samples with each batch.
• Perform preventive maintenance and calibration of equipment as
per manufacturer recommendations.
• Review and document any out-of-range quality control results and
follow the corrective actions taken.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Reference intervals are usually determined based on the
population studies and the intended use of the results. Consult
relevant guidelines or medical literature.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's instructions for GC/MS or LC/MS-MS.
• Certification of reference materials for THC and THC-COOH.
• Published clinical and forensic guidelines on cannabinoid testing.
This procedure ensures that cannabinoid analysis in whole blood is
conducted following validated methods and regulatory requirements.
Please ensure strict adherence to this SOP for accurate and reliable
results.
