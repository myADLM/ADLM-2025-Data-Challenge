Standard Operating Procedure for Analytical Phase: Caraway
IGE, Serum
1. Purpose
This SOP outlines the procedure for the analytical phase of
generating results for Caraway, IGE, Serum. Ensuring accurate,
consistent, and timely results is essential for diagnosing and
monitoring patients.
2. Scope
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel involved in the
analysis of Caraway, IGE, Serum using the designated automated
analyzer.
3. Responsibilities
• Laboratory technologists are responsible for performing and
verifying the analysis according to this SOP.
• Supervisors ensure compliance and provide guidance on any
troubleshooting.
• Quality control staff ensure QC measures are followed and
documented.
4. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies
• Automated analyzer (e.g., IMMULITE®, ADVIA Centaur®)
• Caraway IGE, Serum reagent kits
• Calibrators and controls
• Microcentrifuge tubes, pipettes, and tips
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
5. Specimen Requirements
• Specimen Type: Serum
• Volume: Minimum 0.5 ml
• Storage: Refrigerate at 2-8°C if not analyzed within 8 hours.
Freeze at -20°C for longer storage.
• Unacceptable Specimens: Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
6. Procedure
6.1 Calibration and QC
1. Calibration:
◦ Calibrate the analyzer according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
◦ Use calibrators provided with the reagent kit.
◦ Record calibration data in the calibration log.
2. Quality Control:
◦ Run low, medium, and high controls daily and document
results.
◦ Acceptable limits: As specified by the manufacturer.
◦ If QC fails, do not proceed with patient samples.
Troubleshoot according to SOP and document actions.
6.2 Analysis
1. Preparation:
◦ Allow reagents and samples to reach room temperature
before analysis.
◦ Mix samples gently by inversion.
2. Loading Samples:
◦ Label samples and controls appropriately.
◦ Load samples, controls, and calibrators into the instrument
racks.
◦ Enter sample information into the analyzer’s software or LIS.
3. Running the Assay:
◦ Select the Caraway IGE, Serum assay protocol on the
analyzer.
◦ Start the run according to the analyzer’s instructions.
◦ Monitor the analyzer for any system alerts or errors during
the run.
6.3 Post-Analysis
1. Reviewing Results:
◦ Review raw data for anomalies or error codes.
◦ Results falling outside the expected range should be
repeated or flagged for review.
2. Verification and Reporting:
◦ Verify results against QC and calibration data.
◦ Enter verified results into the LIS.
◦ Report any critical values to the physician immediately,
according to the critical value reporting procedure.
7. Troubleshooting
• If there are issues with the analyzer, refer to the manufacturer's
troubleshooting guide.
• Common issues include clogged pipette tips, reagent depletion, or
calibration failures.
• Document all troubleshooting steps in the maintenance log.
8. Maintenance
• Schedule and perform routine maintenance on the analyzer as
per the manufacturer's recommendations.
• Clean and decontaminate workplace surfaces and equipment
daily.
9. Record Keeping
• Maintain accurate and detailed records of calibration, QC,
maintenance, and specimen analysis.
• Store records securely for a minimum of 2 years for reference and
regulatory compliance.
10. References
• Manufacturer’s user manual and reagent kit insert.
• Institutional policies on laboratory safety and quality control.
• Regulatory guidelines from CLIA, CAP, and other accreditation
bodies.
11. Attachments
• Caraway IGE, Serum calibration log.
• Quality Control result log.
• Maintenance log.
• Troubleshooting checklists.
By following this protocol, laboratory personnel can ensure precise
and reliable results in the analysis of Caraway, IGE, Serum, thus
aiding in effective patient management.
