Title: Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Carbamazepine-10,11-Epoxide, Serum
1. PURPOSE To ensure accurate, precise, and consistent testing
of Carbamazepine-10,11-Epoxide levels in serum specimens,
following the receipt and accessioning of the sample within the
laboratory.
2. SCOPE This protocol applies to the measurement of
Carbamazepine-10,11-Epoxide in serum samples using liquid
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) or
other validated methodologies.
3. RESPONSIBILITY It is the responsibility of trained laboratory
personnel to perform the analytical testing, validate results, and
ensure proper documentation following this SOP. Laboratory
supervisors are responsible for reviewing and maintaining the
integrity of the testing process.
4. SPECIMENS Acceptable Specimen:
• Serum: Collected in a red-top tube or serum separator tube
(SST).
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Any serum samples that are visibly hemolyzed, lipemic, or grossly
contaminated.
• Specimens collected in anticoagulant tubes (e.g., EDTA, heparin).
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Required Equipment:
• LC-MS/MS system or validated analytical instrumentation.
• Refrigerated centrifuge.
• Micropipettes and pipette tips.
• Volumetric flasks and sample vials.
• Vortex mixer.
• Sonicator.
• Analytical balance.
Required Reagents:
• Mobile phase components (e.g., acetonitrile, water, formic acid).
• Carbamazepine-10,11-Epoxide reference standard.
• Calibration standards and quality control materials.
• Internal standards (if applicable).
1. REAGENT AND STANDARD PREPARATION Prepare mobile
phases, calibration standards, and quality control (QC)
materials according to manufacturers’ recommendations or
validated in-house procedures. Ensure all reagents and
solutions are stored and used within their expiration dates.
Preparation Steps:
• Calibrate the analytical balance prior to use.
• Weigh the accurate amount of Carbamazepine-10,11-Epoxide
reference standard and dissolve in an appropriate solvent to
prepare stock solutions.
• Prepare calibration standards and QC samples at multiple
concentrations within the outlined therapeutic range.
1. PROCEDURE
Sample Preparation:
1. Allow the serum samples to reach room temperature if stored
refrigerated.
2. Centrifuge serum samples at 2000-3000 x g for 10-15 minutes
to separate serum if SST was used.
3. Transfer serum to labeled aliquot vials.
4. Aliquot serum samples (e.g., 100 μL) to vials for LC-MS/MS
analysis.
5. Add an internal standard solution (if applicable) to serum
samples.
6. Vortex the samples for 30 seconds.
7. Sonicate for 5 minutes or other validated sample preparation
method.
LC-MS/MS Operation:
1. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for system start-up,
tuning, and calibration.
2. Load samples, calibration standards, and QC materials onto the
LC-MS/MS system.
3. Run an initial system blank to ensure there are no carryover or
background interferences.
4. Inject prepared samples, standards, and QC materials into the
system following the validated batch sequence.
5. Monitor the chromatographic and mass spectrometric
parameters during the analysis.
6. DATA ANALYSIS AND REPORTING
7. Review chromatograms and ion traces for each sample to verify
peak integration and absence of interference.
8. Compare retention times and ion ratios to those of the
calibration standards and reference material.
9. Quantify Carbamazepine-10,11-Epoxide concentrations using
the calibration curve generated from the standards.
10. Ensure all QC materials fall within the predetermined
acceptable range. If QC material results are out of range,
reanalyze the respective samples and identify any sources of
error.
11. Verify and validate results according to laboratory standards.
12. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run QC samples at multiple concentrations within the assay
range in each analytical batch.
• Document all data, including calibration curves, sample results,
and QC results.
• If any issues arise (e.g., instrument failure, QC failure),
troubleshoot according to standard laboratory procedures and
document the corrective actions taken.
1. MAINTENANCE AND CALIBRATION
• Regularly maintain and calibrate the LC-MS/MS system and
related equipment as per the manufacturer’s guidelines.
• Document all maintenance and calibration activities in the
equipment logbook.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Report the Carbamazepine-10,11-Epoxide serum levels as
determined by the validated analytical method to the laboratory
information system (LIS).
• Ensure all data reviewed and validated meet the required quality
standards.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS Therapeutic Range: Highlight
laboratory-specific reference intervals or ranges provided by
clinical guidelines or physician requirements.
2. METHOD LIMITATIONS Refer to the LC-MS/MS method
validation documentation for limitations on specific drugs or
compounds interfering with the test.
3. REFERENCES Include references to method validation
documentation, CLSI guidelines, instrument manuals, reagent
datasheets, and other relevant materials.
