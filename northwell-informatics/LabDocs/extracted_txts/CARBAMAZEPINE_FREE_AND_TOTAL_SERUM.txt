Protocol for the Analytical Phase of Generating Results for
Carbamazepine, Free and Total, Serum
1. PURPOSE
This protocol outlines the analytical procedures for generating results
for carbamazepine, free and total, in serum. The procedures ensure
accuracy, precision, and reliability of test results to guide therapeutic
drug monitoring for patients on carbamazepine therapy.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing the
analysis and documenting all relevant data according to this protocol.
1. DEFINITION
Carbamazepine, free and total, are measured in serum to monitor
therapeutic levels and ensure safe medication management of
patients.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen Collection:
• Preferred specimen type: Serum from a blood sample collected in
a red-top tube.
• Collect at least 5 mL of blood to ensure sufficient serum volume.
• Avoid hemolysis by drawing the blood gently and avoiding
prolonged tourniquet application.
Specimen Handling:
• Centrifuge and separate serum from cells within 2 hours of
collection to avoid degradation.
• Serum samples should be stored at 2-8°C and analyzed within 7
days. For longer storage, serum should be frozen at -20°C (up to
6 months).
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
• Samples with incorrect labeling or those that exceed stability
limits.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Centrifuge
• Analytical balance
• Automated immunoassay analyzer (e.g., Roche Cobas Integra)
• Freezer (-20°C)
Reagents:
• Calibrators and controls specific for carbamazepine (Free and
Total)
• Quality control materials (Bi-level)
• Reagent kits (manufacturer-specific for carbamazepine)
Supplies:
• Red-top tubes
• Pipettes and tips
• Vials for sample aliquots
• Gloves and PPE
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation:
1. Ensure the analyzer is calibrated and quality control materials
are run, meeting acceptable criteria before running patient
samples.
2. Verify that all reagents, calibrators, and controls are within their
expiration dates and stored appropriately.
B. Total Carbamazepine Measurement:
1. Allow the serum sample to reach room temperature.
2. Vortex the sample to ensure homogeneity.
3. Load the sample into the automated analyzer according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
4. Retrieve and review the results. Perform troubleshooting if
results are flagged by the analyzer.
C. Free Carbamazepine Measurement:
1. Perform ultrafiltration on the serum sample to separate the free
drug fraction. Use manufacturer-specific ultrafiltration devices.
2. Centrifuge the ultrafiltration device at 37°C for 10 minutes at
2000xg (check device-specific instructions).
3. Carefully collect the ultrafiltrate.
4. Load the ultrafiltrate into the automated analyzer specific for the
free fraction.
5. Retrieve and review results. Perform troubleshooting if results
are flagged by the analyzer.
6. QUALITY CONTROL:
• Utilize two levels of quality control samples (low and high) with
each batch of patient samples.
• QC samples should be tested at the beginning of each run.
• Results must fall within established control limits. If QC fails,
investigate and resolve any issues before proceeding with patient
samples.
7. REPORTING RESULTS:
• Review and validate results in the Laboratory Information System
(LIS). Ensure digital flags or alerts are addressed before
reporting.
• Include free and total carbamazepine levels in the final patient
report.
• Document any analytical issues or deviations in the LIS.
Reference Intervals
• Total Carbamazepine: Therapeutic range: 4-12 µg/mL
• Free Carbamazepine: Therapeutic range: Typically, 15-30% of
total drug concentration
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolysis, lipemia, or icterus in samples can impact the results.
Reject samples exhibiting these conditions.
• Cross-reactivity from structurally related compounds or
medications may interfere.
