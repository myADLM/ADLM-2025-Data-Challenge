LABORATORY STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE
ANALYTICAL PHASE PROTOCOL FOR CARBAMAZEPINE,
FREE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
This SOP describes the procedure for the quantitative determination
of free Carbamazepine in serum using a validated laboratory method.
Carbamazepine is an anticonvulsant drug used primarily for the
treatment of epilepsy and neuropathic pain. The determination of free
Carbamazepine levels in serum is important for ensuring therapeutic
drug monitoring and avoiding toxicity.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred specimen: Serum collected in a red-top tube without gel
separator.
• Minimum volume: 1 mL of serum.
• Specimen stability:
◦ Room temperature: 8 hours
◦ Refrigerated (2-8°C): 7 days
◦ Frozen (-20°C): 1 month
Note: Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric specimens may interfere with the
assay and should be avoided.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) system with
UV detection
• Carbamazepine-free reference serum and quality control
materials
• Carbamazepine calibrators
• Reagents for protein precipitation (e.g., acetonitrile)
• Mobile phase (e.g., mixture of water and organic solvent such as
methanol or acetonitrile)
• HPLC columns specific for Carbamazepine separation
• Vortex mixer, centrifuge, and appropriate micropipettes
• Analytical balance
1. PROCEDURE
2. Sample Preparation
a. Thaw frozen specimens to room temperature before analysis.
b. Mix all specimens well by gentle inversion. Do not vortex to
avoid air bubbles. c. Pipette 1 mL of serum into a labeled
centrifuge tube.
3. Protein Precipitation
a. Add 2 mL of acetonitrile to the serum sample to precipitate
proteins. b. Vortex the mixture for 30 seconds to ensure
complete mixing. c. Centrifuge at 10,000 x g for 10 minutes at
4°C.
4. Supernatant Collection
a. Carefully transfer the supernatant to a clean, labeled HPLC
vial. b. Cap the HPLC vial securely.
5. Chromatographic Conditions
a. Set up the HPLC system according to the manufacturer's
instructions. b. Column: C18 reversed-phase HPLC column c.
Mobile phase: 60% methanol and 40% water (isocratic elution)
d. Flow rate: 1.0 mL/min e. Detection: UV at 210 nm f. Injection
volume: 10 µL
6. Calibration and Quality Control
a. Prepare a standard calibration curve using Carbamazepine
calibrators at known concentrations. b. Include quality control
(QC) samples at low, medium, and high levels in each run to
ensure the accuracy and precision of the assay. c. Analyze the
calibrators and QC samples before analyzing patient samples.
7. Sample Analysis
a. Inject 10 µL of the prepared sample into the HPLC system. b.
Ensure that no carryover occurs by injecting a blank between
samples if necessary. c. Run the samples according to the
chromatographic conditions described.
8. Data Analysis
a. Identify and integrate the peak corresponding to
Carbamazepine. b. Calculate the concentration of free
Carbamazepine in serum by comparing the sample peak area
to the calibration curve. c. Review and verify the calculated
results for accuracy and consistency with QC results.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
• Report the free Carbamazepine concentration in μg/mL or μmol/L
as appropriate.
• Include relevant comments or interpretations as necessary.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run at least two levels of QC material with each assay run.
• QC results must be within the established acceptable ranges
before patient results can be reported.
• Document all QC results and any corrective actions taken for out-
of-range results.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Therapeutic range: 4-12 μg/mL (for free Carbamazepine)
• Any results outside the therapeutic range should be flagged, and
appropriate clinical action should be taken.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolysis, lipemia, or icterus in the specimen may affect the
accuracy of the assay.
• Follow specific HPLC method limitations and troubleshooting
guides provided by the HPLC manufacturer.

system used.
1. REVISIONS AND REVIEW
• This SOP should be reviewed annually or as needed based on
changes in methodology or instrumentation.
This SOP establishes a clear and detailed process for the analysis of
free Carbamazepine in serum, ensuring reliable and accurate results
that can be used for therapeutic drug monitoring.
