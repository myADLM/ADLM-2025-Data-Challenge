Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): CARBAMAZEPINE
HYPERSENSITIVITY PHARMACOGENOMICS
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to establish the procedures for the
analytic phase of generating pharmacogenomics results for
carbamazepine hypersensitivity. This includes the detection of
specific genetic variants associated with hypersensitivity to
carbamazepine. The steps provided ensure accurate and reliable
determination of genetic variants using established molecular
techniques.
1. SCOPE
This SOP applies to laboratory staff responsible for performing and
analyzing pharmacogenomics tests related to carbamazepine
hypersensitivity.
1. RESPONSIBILITIES
All designated laboratory personnel are responsible for adhering to
this SOP when processing samples for pharmacogenomics testing. It
is also the responsibility of supervisors to review and approve results
before they are reported.
1. DEFINITIONS
• Carbamazepine Hypersensitivity: An adverse immune reaction
to the anticonvulsant drug carbamazepine.
• Pharmacogenomics (PGx): The study of how genes affect a
person’s response to drugs.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Sample Type: Whole blood, buccal swabs, or saliva.
• Volume: 5 mL of whole blood or 1 buccal swab.
• Storage: Whole blood samples should be stored at 2-8°C if
processed within 72 hours; buccal swabs and saliva specimens
can be stored at room temperature.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• DNA extraction kit (e.g., Qiagen QIAamp DNA Mini Kit)
• PCR reagents (e.g., Taq polymerase, dNTPs)
• Thermocycler
• Genotyping platform (e.g., Real-time PCR, Sequencing)
• Primers specific for HLA-B*15:02, among other relevant genetic
variants
• Quality control materials
1. PROCEDURE
7.1 DNA Extraction
a. Extract DNA from whole blood, buccal swabs, or saliva according
to the manufacturer’s protocol provided by the DNA extraction kit. b.
Measure DNA concentration and purity using a spectrophotometer.
Acceptable purity (A260/A280) should be between 1.8 and 2.0.
7.2 PCR Amplification
a. Prepare the PCR reaction mix by adding template DNA, primers
specific for the target variants, dNTPs, Taq polymerase, and PCR
buffer. b. Use the following PCR conditions:
• Initial Denaturation: 95°C for 5 minutes
• Denaturation: 95°C for 30 seconds
• Annealing: 60°C for 30 seconds
• Extension: 72°C for 1 minute
• Final Extension: 72°C for 7 minutes
• Number of Cycles: 35
7.3 Genotyping
a. Perform genotyping using real-time PCR or sequencing method. b.
For real-time PCR:
• Set up the reaction in accordance with instrument-specific
protocols.
• Analyze data from the cycler; ensure proper positive and negative
controls. c. For sequencing:
• Prepare the DNA for sequencing, following the sequencing
instrument’s protocol.
• Analyze the sequencing data for target variant(s).
1. QUALITY CONTROL
a. Include both positive and negative controls in every assay. b. Run
quality control samples at the beginning and end of each batch. c.
Review amplification curves in real-time PCR for abnormalities. d.
Validate any outlier results by rerunning the assay.
1. INTERPRETATION AND REPORTING
a. Compare results against known variant databases to determine
the presence of relevant genetic variants, particularly HLA-B*15:02.
b. Supervisor reviews the data and approves results prior to
reporting. c. Report the results to the referring physician or
healthcare provider with appropriate comments based on the
genotyping.
1. REFERENCES
a. Manufacturer’s protocol for the DNA extraction kit. b. Instrument-
specific guidelines for PCR and sequencing. c. Relevant literature on
the correlation between HLA-B*15:02 and carbamazepine
hypersensitivity.
1. DOCUMENTATION
a. Document the processing steps, including DNA extraction, PCR
conditions, genotyping results, and quality control measures, in a
laboratory information system (LIS). b. Store all records and reports
for a period of five years or as per institutional guidelines.
This SOP for the CARBAMAZEPINE HYPERSENSITIVITY
PHARMACOGENOMICS test ensures standardized and reliable
genetic testing processes, allowing for accurate detection of genetic
predispositions related to carbamazepine hypersensitivity.
