Protocol for CARBAMAZEPINE PROFILE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE This Secondary Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
defines the procedure for the quantification and analysis of
carbamazepine and its metabolites in serum using High-Performance
Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) or other validated analytical
methods. Ensuring precise and accurate results is paramount for
therapeutic drug monitoring and patient management.
2. PRINCIPLE Carbamazepine is an anticonvulsant used primarily in
the treatment of epilepsy and neuropathic pain. Monitoring serum
levels is crucial for ensuring therapeutic efficacy and avoiding toxicity.
The analysis involves separation of carbamazepine and its relevant
metabolites from the serum matrix followed by detection through
HPLC or an alternative validated method.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENT
3.1 Preferred Specimen
• Serum: 1-2 mL serum collected in a standard red-top or serum
separator tube (SST).
3.2 Specimen Handling
• The sample must be centrifuged and serum separated within 2
hours of collection.
• Serum must be stored at 2-8°C if analysis is within 48 hours. For
longer storage, freeze at -20°C.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
4.1 Equipment
• High-Performance Liquid Chromatograph (HPLC) with UV/vis
detector or other validated analytical instrumentation.
• Automated pipettes and tips.
• Centrifuge.
• Vortex mixer.
• Standard laboratory glassware.
4.2 Reagents
• Mobile phase solvent (mixture of water, acetonitrile, and
methanol, or as per specific method).
• Carbamazepine and its metabolite standards (certified reference
materials).
• Calibration standard solutions.
• Quality Control (QC) materials.
• Internal standard (when applicable).
4.3 Supplies
• Serum separator tubes.
• Storage vials.
• HPLC column specified for carbamazepine analysis.
• Filtration devices/syringe filters.
5. PROCEDURE
5.1 Calibration Curve Preparation
1. Prepare calibration standards by diluting the certified reference
standards in blank serum matrix.
2. Construct a calibration curve over the desired range (e.g.,
0.2-20 μg/mL).
3. Run and record the calibration curve on the HPLC system.
5.2 Sample Preparation
1. Thaw serum samples if frozen and bring to room temperature.
2. Vortex samples for 10 seconds.
3. If necessary, dilute sample in mobile phase or as per specific
method requirements.
5.3 HPLC Analysis
1. Set up the HPLC system according to the manufacturer's
instructions and method SOP.
2. Ensure the column is equilibrated with the mobile phase.
3. Inject calibration standards, QC samples, and patient serum
samples into the HPLC system.
4. Monitor the chromatogram and record the retention times and
peak areas for carbamazepine and its metabolites.
5.4 Data Analysis
1. Use chromatographic software to quantify carbamazepine and
its metabolites by comparing sample peak areas to the
calibration curve.
2. Ensure the quality and validity of the run by verifying QC
samples meet the acceptance criteria.
3. Reanalyze samples if QC samples fail to meet criteria.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
6.1 Internal and External Controls
1. Analyze internal controls with each batch of patient samples.
2. Use external QC samples from proficiency testing programs to
validate assay performance periodically.
6.2 Calibration Verifications
1. Perform calibration verification at least once daily or with each
analytical run.
2. Use multi-level QC materials to ensure linearity and accuracy.
6.3 Proficiency Testing
1. Participate in proficiency testing programs as per laboratory
guidelines to assess inter-laboratory performance.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
7.1 Review and Validation
1. Cross-check patient results with QC results to ensure no
deviations.
2. Validate all results before reporting to ensure accuracy and
completeness.
3. Use predefined criteria for flagging critical results and take
appropriate actions.
7.2 Documentation
1. Document all analytical conditions, raw data, calculations, and
any deviations in the laboratory information system (LIS).
2. Record maintaining retentions as per regulatory guidelines.
8. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Therapeutic range for carbamazepine: 4-12 μg/mL (may vary with
different clinical protocols)
• Monitor for signs of toxicity if levels exceed 12 μg/mL.
9. REFERENCES
• Latest Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI)
guidelines for therapeutic drug monitoring.
• Manufacturer instructions for HPLC instrumentation.
• AU-specific laboratory guidelines.
This protocol ensures that serum samples for carbamazepine are
accurately processed and analyzed, providing reliable data for
therapeutic monitoring and patient care.
