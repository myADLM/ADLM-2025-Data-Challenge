CARBAMAZEPINE (TEGRETOL), PLASMA ANALYTICAL SOP
1. PURPOSE
To provide clear, consistent, standardized instructions for the
analytical phase of generating Carbamazepine (Tegretol) results in
plasma. The objective is to ensure accurate and precise
measurement of Carbamazepine levels to support therapeutic drug
monitoring and patient management.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel involved in the analysis
of Carbamazepine (Tegretol) in plasma samples using
chromatographic or immunoassay methodologies in the laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the laboratory technologist to follow this SOP
when performing the analysis of Carbamazepine in plasma samples.
The supervisor is responsible for ensuring that staff is trained on this
procedure and maintains competency.
4. DEFINITIONS
• Carbamazepine (Tegretol): An anticonvulsant and mood-
stabilizing drug used primarily in the treatment of epilepsy and
bipolar disorder.
• Plasma: The liquid component of blood, in which cells are
suspended.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Equipment:
◦ Chromatograph (HPLC/GC) or appropriate immunoassay
analyzer.
◦ Centrifuge.
◦ Micropipettors and tips.
◦ Vortex mixer.
◦ Temperature-monitored refrigerator and freezer.
◦ Analytical balance.
◦ Water bath or incubator (if necessary).
• Reagents:
◦ Calibration standards of Carbamazepine.
◦ Quality control samples (low, medium, high concentration).
◦ Internal standard (if applicable).
◦ Mobile phase reagents (for chromatographic method).
◦ Specific immunoassay reagents (antibodies, substrates,
buffers).
◦ Plasma diluents.
◦ Methanol or other solvents (for extraction, if necessary).
• Supplies:
◦ Sample tubes (plasma).
◦ Screw-capped vials.
◦ Disposable gloves.
◦ Lab coats.
◦ Labels and marking pens.
6. PROCEDURE
6.1 Preparation of Calibration Standards and Quality Control
Samples:
1. Prepare calibration standards ranging from the lower limit of
quantification (LLOQ) to the upper limit of quantification (ULOQ)
using known concentrations of Carbamazepine.
2. Prepare quality control samples at low, medium, and high
concentrations within the calibration range.
3. Store calibration standards and QC samples in designated
temperature-controlled conditions as per manufacturer's
guidance.
6.2 Preparation of Plasma Samples:
1. Ensure all plasma samples have been stored in accordance
with proper protocols (e.g., samples should be stored at -20°C if
not analyzed immediately).
2. Thaw plasma samples at room temperature. Mix gently by
inverting or vortexing.
3. Centrifuge the plasma samples at 1,500-2,000g for 10 minutes
to remove particulates.
4. Transfer the clear supernatant to a clean, labeled tube.
6.3 Analysis Using Chromatographic Method:
1. Sample Extraction (if required):
◦ If using HPLC or GC, extract Carbamazepine from plasma
using liquid-liquid extraction or solid-phase extraction (SPE)
techniques.
◦ Dry the extracted sample under nitrogen and reconstitute in
an appropriate solvent.
2. Instrument Setup:
◦ Set up the chromatograph with appropriate column and
mobile phase according to the method protocol.
◦ Calibrate the instrument using prepared calibration
standards.
◦ Perform a system suitability test to ensure performance
criteria are met.
3. Analysis:
◦ Load the sample vials into the autosampler.
◦ Inject an appropriate volume of calibration standards, QC
samples, and patient samples into the chromatograph.
◦ Acquire and process the chromatographic data.
6.4 Analysis Using Immunoassay Method:
1. Instrument Setup:
◦ Prepare the immunoassay analyzer by loading the required
reagents and calibrators.
◦ Perform an initial calibration using the analyzer's protocol.
2. Analysis:
◦ Load plasma samples, calibrators, and quality control
samples into the analyzer.
◦ Run the assay according to the manufacturer's instructions
and protocol.
6.5 Verification and Documentation:
1. Review calibration curves and quality control results to ensure
they fall within acceptable ranges.
2. Verify the patient's test results against the established
calibration curve.
3. Document all findings, including calibrator and QC data, in the
laboratory information system (LIS).
7. RESULT REPORTING
1. Laboratory results for Carbamazepine (Tegretol) will be
reported in µg/mL (micrograms per milliliter).
2. Ensure all results are reviewed and validated by the
technologist before releasing.
3. If results fall outside the therapeutic range (typically 4-12 µg/
mL), note this on the report and follow the laboratory's protocol
for reporting critical results.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Analyze quality control samples with each analytical run.
2. Ensure that all QC results fall within the acceptable range
established by laboratory protocol.
3. Document any deviations and take corrective action if
necessary.
9. REFERENCES
Include references for calibration standard preparation, method
validation guidelines, and instrument manuals.
10. APPENDICES
Include detailed steps for specific instrument setup, example
chromatograms, troubleshooting guides, and data sheets for QC and
calibration.
Note: This protocol must be routinely reviewed and updated in
accordance with any new regulatory guidelines or technological
advancements.
