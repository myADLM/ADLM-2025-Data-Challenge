CARBAMAZEPINE, TOTAL, SERUM ANALYTICAL PROCEDURE
1. PURPOSE: This SOP outlines the procedure for the
quantitative measurement of Carbamazepine (Tegretol) levels
in patient serum samples. Carbamazepine is an anticonvulsant
and mood-stabilizing drug used primarily in the treatment of
epilepsy and bipolar disorder. This assay is crucial for
therapeutic drug monitoring, pharmacokinetics, and ensuring
patient compliance.
2. SCOPE: This procedure is applicable to all laboratory staff
involved in the analysis of Carbamazepine, Total, Serum at the
CLIA-certified laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY:
• The laboratory technologist is responsible for performing the
Carbamazepine assay and ensuring accuracy and precision of
results.
• The supervisor is responsible for overseeing the process,
troubleshooting, and verifying that all quality controls are within
acceptable limits.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS:
• Specimen Type: Serum
• Collection Container: Red-top tube or serum separator tube (SST)
• Volume: Minimum 1 mL of serum
• Handling and Stability: Serum should be separated from cells
within 2 hours of collection. Serum samples are stable for up to 7
days when stored at 2-8°C and for up to 1 month when frozen at
-20°C.
1. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES:
• Carbamazepine Assay Kit: Comprising the necessary reagents,
standards, and controls
• Calibrators
• Quality Control Materials: High, medium, and low levels
• Micropipettes and pipette tips
• Centrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Analytical Balance
• Assay-specific Analyzer (e.g., HPLC, Immunoassay system)
1. EQUIPMENT:
• Centrifuge for serum separation
• Analytical balance for precise measurement of reagents
• Vortex mixer for sample mixing
• Appropriate Analyzer (e.g., High-Performance Liquid
Chromatography, enzyme immunoassay instrument)
1. PROCEDURE: A. Sample Preparation:
2. Centrifuge the collected blood sample at 1500 x g for 10
minutes to obtain serum.
3. Transfer the serum to a clean, properly labeled tube.
4. Store at 2-8°C until analysis if not immediately processed.
B. Calibration:
1. Prepare the calibration curve using the Carbamazepine
standards provided in the assay kit.
2. Run the calibrators through the analyzer according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
3. Verify the calibration curve by ensuring the correlation
coefficient (r²) is ≥ 0.99.
C. Quality Control:
1. Run both high and low QC samples at the beginning of each
batch of patient samples.
2. Confirm that both QC results fall within the acceptable range
provided by the QC material manufacturer.
3. Document and investigate any QC failures before proceeding
with patient samples.
D. Analytical Measurement:
1. Aliquot the prepared serum samples, calibrators, and QC
materials according to the volume specified in the assay kit
insert.
2. Load the samples, calibrators, and controls onto the analyzer.
3. Initiate the assay run according to the analyzer's software
instructions.
4. Monitor the assay run and address any system errors or alerts
promptly.
E. Result Computation:
1. After assay completion, review the generated data to ensure all
quality controls are within acceptable limits.
2. Calculate the concentration of Carbamazepine in patient
samples using the established calibration curve.
3. Ensure the results are within the clinical reference interval for
Carbamazepine (4-12 µg/mL).
4. REPORTING RESULTS:
5. Verify and validate all patient results against QC and calibration
data.
6. Document any unusual findings or errors.
7. Enter the validated results into the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
8. Critical results (outside the therapeutic range) should be
promptly communicated to the requesting physician as per the
laboratory's critical result policy.
9. QUALITY CONTROL:
10. Run quality control samples with each batch of patient
specimens to ensure accuracy and consistency.
11. Retain records of all QC data, calibration curves, and
instrument maintenance logs.
12. METHOD LIMITATIONS: Refer to the manufacturer's assay
insert for potential interference and cross-reactivity of the
Carbamazepine assay. Factors such as hemolysis, lipemia, and
icterus may affect the accuracy of results.
