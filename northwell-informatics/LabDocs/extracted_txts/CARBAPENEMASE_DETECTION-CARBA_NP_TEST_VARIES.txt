CARBAPENEMASE DETECTION - CARBA NP TEST SOP
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is to
outline the procedure for the detection of carbapenemase production
in bacterial isolates using the Carba NP Test. This SOP is intended to
ensure consistency, accuracy, and reliability of test results for
identifying carbapenem-resistant organisms.
Responsibility: Designated medical laboratory personnel are
responsible for performing the Carba NP Test according to this SOP.
It is the responsibility of all staff to report any inconsistencies or
issues encountered during the procedure to the laboratory
supervisor.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type:
• Pure bacterial cultures grown on agar media.
Specimen Stability:
• Cultures should be fresh, ideally less than 24 hours old.
• Cultures should be grown on non-selective media such as blood
agar.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Mixed bacterial cultures.
• Cultures older than 24 hours.
• Cultures grown on selective or antibiotic-containing media.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Sterile inoculating loops or needles
• Sterile microcentrifuge tubes (1.5 mL)
• Carba NP Test Kit (includes reagents A and B)
• Pipettes and tips
• Vortex mixer
• Timer
• Biosafety cabinet
• Waste disposal container with disinfectant
• Gloves and lab coat
• Thermometer (for ensuring room temperature)
1. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Ensure all reagents and materials are at room temperature.
2. Label sterile microcentrifuge tubes appropriately (e.g., sample
ID, date).
3. Prepare bacterial suspension by picking 3-5 well-isolated
colonies from the agar plate using a sterile inoculating loop or
needle. Suspend the colonies in 400 µL of reagent A in a
microcentrifuge tube. Vortex thoroughly for 10 seconds to
ensure homogeneity.
Carba NP Test Setup: 4. Aliquot 200 µL of the bacterial suspension
into a separate sterile microcentrifuge tube. 5. Add 200 µL of reagent
B to the aliquot and vortex thoroughly for 10 seconds.
Incubation: 6. Incubate the mixture at room temperature (20-26°C) for
up to 2 hours. 7. Observe for a color change. The mixture is
considered positive if a color shift from yellow to red occurs,
indicating carbapenemase production. A yellow color indicates a
negative result.
Quality Control: 8. Run positive and negative controls alongside
patient samples to validate test accuracy. Controls should show
expected color changes.
Interpretation: 9. Record results on the appropriate data log sheet
along with the date, time, and initials of the performing technologist.
10. Positive results: red color change. 11. Negative results: yellow
color.
Reporting Results: 12. Enter results into the Laboratory Information
System (LIS) and verify. 13. Notify the healthcare provider if the result
indicates carbapenemase production. Follow institutional policies for
reporting critical results.
1. PRECAUTIONS
• Use aseptic techniques to avoid contamination.
• Handle reagents and samples with care to avoid exposure.
• Dispose of all biohazard materials according to the laboratory’s
waste disposal protocols.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• False positives or negatives may occur due to improper specimen
handling or contamination.
• Old or mixed cultures may give unreliable results.
• Ensure reagents are stored correctly and used within their expiry
dates.
