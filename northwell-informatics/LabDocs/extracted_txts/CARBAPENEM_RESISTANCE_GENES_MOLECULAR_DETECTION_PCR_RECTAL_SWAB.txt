STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP) Title: Analytical
Process for CARBAPENEM RESISTANCE GENES, MOLECULAR
DETECTION, PCR, RECTAL SWAB
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this protocol is to provide guidelines for the analytical
phase of generating results for carbapenem resistance genes in
rectal swab specimens using molecular detection by PCR. Ensuring
accurate detection of resistance genes like KPC, NDM, VIM, IMP,
and OXA-48 is crucial for appropriate clinical management and
infection control.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing,
validating, and documenting all steps of the analytical phase as
outlined in this protocol.
• It is the responsibility of all laboratory personnel to report any
discrepancies or issues encountered during the analytical process
to a supervisor immediately.
1. DEFINITION
• Carbapenem Resistance Genes: Genes that encode resistance
to carbapenem antibiotics, which are typically identified by PCR.
• PCR: Polymerase Chain Reaction, a technique used to amplify
and detect specific DNA sequences.
• Rectal Swab: A clinical specimen collected from the rectum to
test for the presence of carbapenem-resistant organisms.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• PCR Thermocycler
• DNA extraction kit
• PCR reagents (Primers, Taq Polymerase, dNTPs, Buffer)
• Nuclease-free water
• Electrophoresis equipment (if verification by gel electrophoresis is
needed)
• PCR tubes/plates and caps/seals
• Centrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Pipettes and sterile tips
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
• Laboratory Disinfectant
1. PROCEDURE
A) Specimen Preparation and DNA Extraction
1. Prepare Workstation:
◦ Disinfect workstation with laboratory disinfectant.
◦ Arrange all required reagents and equipment.
2. Specimen Handling:
◦ Verify specimen identity and ensure correct labeling.
◦ Use appropriate PPE to handle rectal swabs.
◦ Follow the DNA extraction kit protocol to extract DNA from
the rectal swab specimen.
3. Positive and Negative Controls:
◦ Prepare positive and negative control samples according to
kit instructions.
B) PCR Setup
1. Preparing the Master Mix:
◦ Thaw all reagents on ice and gently mix.
◦ Prepare a master mix for the number of reactions needed,
including controls.
◦ Mix PCR reagents in nuclease-free water, ensuring precise
calculations for components like Taq polymerase, primers,
dNTPs, and buffer.
2. Aliquoting the Master Mix:
◦ Dispense the appropriate volume of master mix into each
PCR tube/plate well.
◦ Add extracted DNA sample (5-10 µL) to the respective
tubes/wells.
◦ Include positive and negative controls in the run.
◦ Seal tubes/plates securely.
C) Amplification
1. Programming the PCR Thermocycler:
◦ Program the thermocycler with specific cycling conditions:
▪ Initial denaturation: 95ºC for 5 minutes
▪ Denaturation: 95ºC for 30 seconds
▪ Annealing: 55-60ºC for 30 seconds (depending on primer
Tm)
▪ Extension: 72ºC for 1 minute
▪ Final extension: 72ºC for 5 minutes
◦ Run the program for 35-40 cycles.
2. Monitor the PCR Run:
◦ Ensure the thermocycler completes the program without
interruptions.
D) Detection and Analysis
1. Post-Amplification Handling:
◦ Carefully remove tubes/plates from the thermocycler and
conduct post-PCR procedures in a dedicated area to
prevent contamination.
2. Gel Electrophoresis (if applicable):
◦ Prepare an agarose gel (1-2% concentration).
◦ Load PCR products and molecular weight marker onto the
gel.
◦ Run the gel at appropriate voltage until the dye front has
moved sufficiently.
◦ Visualize bands using a UV transilluminator.
3. Interpretation:
◦ Compare band patterns to control samples and reference
standards.
◦ Document the presence or absence of targeted carbapenem
resistance genes.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include positive and negative controls in every run to ensure the
accuracy and sensitivity of the PCR assay.
• Verify all equipment calibration and maintenance records are up
to date.
• Perform and document all quality control checks as per lab
protocol.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Enter validated data into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Review and verify results according to established lab guidelines.
• Any positive results indicating the presence of carbapenem
resistance genes should be reported immediately to relevant
clinical personnel and infection control teams.
