SOP: Analytical Phase of Generating Results for
CARBAPENEM RESISTANCE GENES, MOLECULAR
DETECTION, PCR, VARIES
1. PURPOSE
To outline the detailed procedure for the detection of carbapenem
resistance genes in bacterial isolates using Polymerase Chain
Reaction (PCR) methodology.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to the molecular detection of carbapenem-
resistance genes using PCR techniques in a laboratory setting.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Molecular Laboratory Technologists: Perform the analysis.
• Laboratory Supervisors: Ensure compliance with the protocol.
• Quality Assurance Team: Monitor and validate the process.
4. PRINCIPLE
PCR is utilized to amplify specific gene sequences associated with
carbapenem resistance from bacterial DNA. Detection is
accomplished through the amplification of target sequences which
are subsequently analyzed to confirm the presence of resistance
genes.
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Bacterial isolates grown on appropriate culture media.
• Genomic DNA extracted from the bacterial isolates.
6. SAFETY PRECAUTIONS
• Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) including
lab coat, gloves, and protective eyewear.
• Follow all biosafety guidelines for handling bacterial cultures and
reagents.
• Dispose of all biohazardous waste according to laboratory
protocols.
7. REAGENTS & SUPPLIES
• PCR reagents including Taq DNA polymerase, dNTP mix, MgCl2,
and buffer.
• Primers specific for carbapenem resistance genes (e.g., KPC,
NDM, OXA-48, VIM, and IMP).
• Positive and negative control DNA.
• Nuclease-free water.
• PCR thermal cycler.
• Agarose gel, ethidium bromide, and gel electrophoresis
equipment.
• UV transilluminator.
8. EQUIPMENT
• PCR thermal cycler.
• Micropipettes and sterile tips.
• Centrifuge.
• Gel electrophoresis apparatus.
• Power supply for electrophoresis.
• UV transilluminator.
• Vortex mixer.
9. PROCEDURE
A) DNA Extraction:
1. Isolate a single colony of the bacterial culture and incubate it
overnight in suitable media.
2. Extract genomic DNA using a validated extraction kit or
protocol.
3. Quantify and assess the quality of the extracted DNA using a
spectrophotometer.
B) PCR Amplification:
1. Prepare the PCR master mix in a sterile tube:
◦ 2X PCR buffer: 10 µL.
◦ Forward primer (10 µM): 0.5 µL.
◦ Reverse primer (10 µM): 0.5 µL.
◦ dNTP mix (10 mM each): 0.5 µL.
◦ Taq DNA polymerase: 0.25 µL.
◦ MgCl2 (50 mM): 1.5 µL.
◦ Nuclease-free water: up to 25 µL.
Adjust the volumes as necessary for individual reaction
requirements.
2. Add 1 µL of DNA template to the PCR mix.
3. Include positive and negative controls with each batch of tests.
4. Vortex briefly and centrifuge the PCR tube to collect the
contents at the bottom.
5. Load the PCR tubes into the thermal cycler and run the
program as follows:
◦ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 5 minutes.
◦ Denaturation: 95°C for 30 seconds.
◦ Annealing: 55-65°C (depending on primer Tm) for 30
seconds.
◦ Extension: 72°C for 1 minute.
◦ Final extension: 72°C for 5 minutes.
◦ Hold: 4°C.
C) Gel Electrophoresis:
1. Prepare a 1.5% agarose gel with ethidium bromide.
2. Load 5 µL of PCR product mixed with 1 µL of loading dye into
each well.
3. Include a DNA ladder as a molecular weight marker.
4. Run the gel at 100V until the dye front reaches an appropriate
distance.
5. Visualize the bands using a UV transilluminator.
10. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
• Compare the bands observed in the test samples with those of
the positive control:
◦ Presence of a band at the expected size indicates a positive
result for carbapenem resistance genes.
◦ Absence of a band indicates a negative result.
◦ Ensure that negative controls show no bands to validate the
absence of contamination.
11. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run both positive and negative controls with each batch of
reactions.
• Document all observations including any anomalies.
• Perform periodic equipment calibration and maintenance.
12. REPORTING RESULTS
• Enter the results into the laboratory information system (LIS)
following verification by technologists.
• Positive results should be clearly indicated, specifying the
detected gene(s).
• Notify the supervisory staff and relevant clinical personnel of
positive findings.

• Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines for
molecular testing.
• User manuals for PCR thermal cycler and gel electrophoresis
equipment.
• Journals and literature specific to carbapenem resistance
mechanisms and molecular detection methods.
