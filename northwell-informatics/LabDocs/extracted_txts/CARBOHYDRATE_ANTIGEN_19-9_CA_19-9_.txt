STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP)
TITLE: Analytical Phase Protocol for Generating Results for
Carbohydrate Antigen 19-9 (CA 19-9)
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to provide clear, step-by-step
instructions for the detection and quantification of Carbohydrate
Antigen 19-9 (CA 19-9) in serum or plasma samples in order to
ensure the generation of accurate and reliable results.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel involved in the
analytical phase for CA 19-9 testing.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for carrying out
the steps outlined in this procedure.
• Laboratory supervisors are responsible for ensuring compliance
with this SOP and overseeing the results validation process.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Automated immunoanalyzer (e.g., Roche cobas e411 or
equivalent)
• CA 19-9 assays kits specific to the immunoanalyzer used
• Controls (low, medium, and high)
• Calibrators for CA 19-9
• Sample cups or appropriate sample containers
• Personal protective equipment (PPE) (gloves, lab coat, etc.)
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes and tips
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Serum or plasma
• Preferred collection devices: Serum separator tube (SST) or
EDTA tube
• Handling: After collection, promptly centrifuge specimens at 1,300
to 1,800 x g for 10 to 15 minutes. Separate serum or plasma from
cells and store at 2-8°C if not immediately analyzed.
• Stability: Serum/plasma samples should be analyzed within 48
hours when stored at 2-8°C. For longer storage, specimens may
be frozen at -20°C or below for up to 6 months.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run quality control (QC) materials at the beginning of each
analytical run and after every 24 hours of continuous operation.
• Use at least two levels of controls (low and high).
• Record and evaluate QC results before patient sample testing.
• If QC results fall outside the predetermined acceptable range,
troubleshoot the assay, recalibrate the analyzer if needed, and
rerun the QC samples.
7. CALIBRATION
• Calibrate the immunoanalyzer following the manufacturer’s
instructions.
• Perform calibration with each new lot of reagents or after
equipment maintenance.
• Document all calibration activities.
8. PROCEDURE
1. Preparation of Equipment
◦ Turn on the immunoanalyzer and allow it to perform an initial
self-check.
◦ Ensure all reagents, calibrators, controls, and samples are
at room temperature prior to use.
◦ Load reagents, calibrators, and controls onto the instrument
as per the manufacturer's guidelines.
2. Sample Preparation
◦ Verify the identity of each sample against the laboratory
accession records.
◦ Aliquot the required volume of serum or plasma into sample
cups.
3. Loading Samples and Running the Assay
◦ Place sample cups into the designated slots on the
analyzer.
◦ Input the sample identification information and desired
assay parameters into the analyzer software.
◦ Start the assay run following the instrument’s operational
manual.
4. Analyzing Results
◦ Once the run is completed, review the generated data for
QC results first.
◦ Verify that all internal QC measures meet the acceptance
criteria.
◦ Review patient results. Any sample with a reading outside
the normal range should be flagged for further evaluation.
◦ If the sample result falls outside the linear range of the
assay, dilution and retesting may be necessary.
9. RESULTS REPORTING
• Transfer verified results to the Laboratory Information System
(LIS) for authorized reporting and interpretation.
• Ensure patient confidentiality and data security in compliance with
regulatory protocols.
10. REFERENCE RANGES
• Normal Reference Range: < 37 U/mL (may vary by assay kit and
patient demographics, refer to specific kit insert for detailed
reference values)
11. PROCEDURAL NOTES
• Handle all biological specimens and materials with care,
observing all safety protocols to prevent exposure to bloodborne
pathogens.
• Promptly clean and maintain the immunoanalyzer according to
the manufacturer’s service and maintenance schedule.
12. TROUBLESHOOTING
• Refer to the immunoanalyzer’s user manual for common error
messages and corrective actions.
• Consult with the technical supervisor or manufacturer support
hotline for unresolved issues.
