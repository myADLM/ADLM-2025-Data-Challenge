Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
1. PURPOSE
To outline the analytical protocol for the generation of results for
Carbohydrate Antigen 19-9 (CA 19-9) levels in pancreatic cyst fluid
using the designated analytical instrument.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory staff and technologists are responsible for
following this SOP to ensure accurate measurement of CA 19-9
levels in pancreatic cyst fluid samples.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen:
• Preferred/Acceptable:
◦ Pancreatic cyst fluid collected during medical procedures and
transferred into a properly labelled container.
• Unacceptable:
◦ Specimens with insufficient volume for testing.
◦ Specimens visibly contaminated with non-fluid material.
◦ Specimens not properly labelled or collected outside the
established conditions.
Specimen Handling:
• Immediately after collection, samples should be stored at 2-8°C
and transported to the laboratory within 48 hours.
• If specimens cannot be processed within 48 hours, they should be
aliquoted and frozen at -20°C or lower for storage up to 6 months.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• Analytical platform: [Specify Instrument Model, e.g., Cobas e411,
Abbott Architect]
• CA 19-9 reagent kit compliant with the analytical instrument used.
• Quality control materials (Bio-Rad Liquichek Tumor Marker
Controls or equivalent)
• Consumables: Pipettes, cuvettes, test tubes
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE): Lab coat, gloves, safety
glasses
4. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation
1. Review all specimen labelling and accompanying test
requisition forms.
2. Allow stored sample (refrigerated sample) to reach room
temperature before analysis. Thaw frozen samples completely
and thoroughly mix by gentle inversion.
3. Set up the analytical instrument according to the manufacturer's
instructions. Ensure all maintenance checks are accomplished.
B. Running the Assay
1. Load the CA 19-9 reagent kit onto the analyzer platform.
2. Program the analyzer for CA 19-9 testing, inputting necessary
sample identifiers (accession numbers).
3. Pipette the sample into the designated test tube/cuvette as per
instrument instructions.
4. Insert the test tube/cuvette into the analyzer.
C. Quality Control
1. Perform QC checks using the designated quality control
materials:
◦ Run two levels of quality control material (Low and High)
before processing patient samples.
◦ Ensure results fall within manufacturer's established range.
If QC values are out of range, troubleshooting steps outlined
by the manufacturer must be followed and corrective actions
documented.
D. Analysis and Result Generation
1. Start the analysis using the programmed assay.
2. Upon completion, retrieve and review the results output by the
analytical instrument.
3. Verify results, ensuring they are within laboratory-established
reference ranges.
4. If results are questionable or fall outside expected ranges, re-
run the sample following instrument troubleshooting guidelines.
5. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Transmit results electronically to the Laboratory Information
System (LIS) for review and verification.
2. Review and verify all results – flag abnormal or critical values,
add appropriate commentaries as needed.
3. Ensure any critical results are communicated immediately to
the physician as per laboratory policy.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Continuous monitoring of each analytical run's validity via
embedded system checks.
• Document all QC outcomes within the site-specific quality control
log.
• Regular calibration and maintenance of analytical instruments as
per manufacturer recommendations.
7. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Establish and verify reference intervals specific for pancreatic cyst
fluid CA 19-9 levels, referring to instrument instructions and
literature.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Potential interferences including hemolysis, icterus, and lipemia
that may affect the accuracy of CA 19-9 levels.
• Refer to the manufacturer's product insert for detailed reagent pad
limitations.
9. DOCUMENTATION AND REFERENCES
• Consult the analyzer manual and CA 19-9 reagent kit insert for
specific operational instructions.
• Maintain complete and accurate documentation of all analytical
runs, quality control checks, and maintenance activities.
10. SAFETY & DISPOSAL
• Follow standard laboratory safety protocols including the use of
PPE.
• Dispose of all biological and chemical waste according to local
regulations.
11. REFERENCES
• [Manufacturer's Analyzer Manual]
• [Manufacturer's CA 19-9 Reagent Kit Insert]
• Laboratory-specific policies for the operation of analytical
instruments and QC procedures.
