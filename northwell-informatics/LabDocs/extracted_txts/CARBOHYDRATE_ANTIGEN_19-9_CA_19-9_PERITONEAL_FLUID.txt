Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
CA 19-9 Analysis in Peritoneal Fluid
1. PURPOSE
This SOP is designed to provide standardized procedures for the
accurate and precise measurement of Carbohydrate Antigen 19-9
(CA 19-9) levels in peritoneal fluid specimens. The objective is to
ensure reliable and reproducible results that comply with CLIA
guidelines and laboratory accreditation standards.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND HANDLING
Specimen Type: Peritoneal fluid
Volume: Minimum volume required: 1 mL
Storage and Stability: - Store peritoneal fluid at 2-8°C if the analysis
is conducted within 72 hours. - For long-term storage, freeze
specimens at -20°C or colder.
Unacceptable Specimens: - Specimens that are hemolyzed, lipemic,
or improperly stored. - Specimens with less than the minimum
required volume.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment: - Automated immunoassay analyzer (e.g., Roche Cobas,
Siemens Immulite, etc.) - Centrifuge - Pipettes and tips -
Refrigerators and freezers (-20°C and -80°C)
Reagents: - CA 19-9 reagent kits specific to the instrument being
used - Quality control materials (two levels: Normal and Pathological)
- Calibrators specific to the assay
Supplies: - Sample tubes - Gloves - Labels - Biohazard disposal
containers
1. QUALITY CONTROL
Internal Quality Control: - Run two levels of quality control (Normal
and Pathological) at the beginning of each day and after each
calibration. - Document QC results. Ensure all values fall within the
predefined acceptable range. Investigate and resolve any out-of-
range results before running patient samples.
Calibrations: - Perform calibration according to the manufacturer's
instructions and only with calibrators provided by the reagent
manufacturer. - Recalibrate the instrument if QC results fall outside
the acceptable range or as per manufacturer's recommendation.
1. PROCEDURE
Sample Preparation: - Centrifuge peritoneal fluid samples at 1500 x g
for 10 minutes to remove any cellular debris. - Aliquot the
supernatant into a labelled clean tube. - Analyze promptly or store the
aliquots at 2-8°C or freeze at -20°C if delayed.
Instrument Setup: - Turn on the immunoassay analyzer and allow it to
reach operating temperature. - Load the CA 19-9 reagent packs,
calibrators, and quality control materials as per the manufacturer's
instructions.
Running the Assay: - Load specimen tubes, ensuring they are
correctly labelled and match the entries in the instrument’s sample
queue. - Select the CA 19-9 assay from the instrument’s menu,
ensuring that the test settings match those recommended by the
reagent manufacturer. - Initiate the run. - Monitor the run for any
alerts or errors indicated by the instrument.
Data Review and Result Interpretation: - Review instrument printout
or electronic data for each specimen and ensure quality control
results are acceptable. - Flag any results that fall outside of the
reference range for further review. - Validate the results in
accordance with laboratory protocols for transmission to the
Laboratory Information System (LIS).
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Enter validated results into the LIS.
• Ensure all critical values and abnormal results are promptly
communicated to the relevant healthcare provider, according to
laboratory policy.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to the reagent manufacturer's insert for specific limitations
related to interference, sensitivity, and specificity.
• Hemolysis, lipemia, and turbidity in samples may interfere with
accurate measurement. Ensure proper sample processing and
handling to mitigate these issues.

By following this SOP, laboratory personnel ensure that the
measurement of CA 19-9 levels in peritoneal fluid is performed
consistently and accurately, adhering to regulatory standards and
institutional policies.
This protocol is effective as of October 2023 and must be reviewed
and updated periodically to account for advances in technology and
changes in regulatory requirements.
