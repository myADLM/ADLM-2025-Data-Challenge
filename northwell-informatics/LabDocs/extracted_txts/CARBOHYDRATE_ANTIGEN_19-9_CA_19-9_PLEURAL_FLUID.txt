Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Analysis of Carbohydrate
Antigen 19-9 (CA 19-9) in Pleural Fluid
1. PURPOSE To outline the analytical procedures for measuring
Carbohydrate Antigen 19-9 (CA 19-9) levels in pleural fluid
specimens using an immunoassay method. This procedure
ensures accurate, reliable, and timely results.
2. SCOPE This SOP is applicable to all laboratory personnel who
perform the analysis of CA 19-9 in pleural fluid in the clinical
laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY It is the responsibility of qualified laboratory
personnel to follow this protocol accurately. Laboratory
supervisors are responsible for ensuring that all personnel are
trained and proficient in this procedure. All internal and external
quality control measures must be performed and documented.
4. SPECIMENS
◦ Preferred: Pleural fluid collected in a sterile container.
◦ Stability: Specimens should be analyzed as soon as
possible, within 24 hours of collection. If delayed, specimens
can be stored at 2-8°C for up to 48 hours or frozen at -20°C
for longer periods. Avoid multiple freeze-thaw cycles.
5. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
◦ Immunoassay analyzer (e.g., Siemens Immulite, Roche
Cobas)
◦ Appropriate immunoassay reagent kit for CA 19-9
◦ Quality control materials (low, medium, and high)
◦ Calibrators
◦ Personal protective equipment (PPE)
◦ Pipettes and pipette tips
6. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Run appropriate quality control samples (low, medium, and
high) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations
before running patient specimens.
◦ Acceptable limits for quality control must be defined
according to the manufacturer's guidelines and internal
laboratory policy. Document results and ensure they are
within acceptable limits before proceeding.
7. PROCEDURE
1. Preparation
▪ Ensure all reagents are at room temperature and
properly mixed.
▪ Calibrate the instrument as per the manufacturer's
instructions using the provided calibrators.
▪ Set up and run the appropriate quality controls.
2. Sample Processing
▪ Label the specimen tubes appropriately.
▪ If frozen, allow pleural fluid specimens to thaw
completely at room temperature and mix gently.
▪ Centrifuge the pleural fluid specimens at 3,000 RPM
for 10 minutes to remove cellular debris.
▪ Collect the clear supernatant for analysis.
3. Assay Procedure
▪ Program the immunoassay analyzer according to the
manufacturer's protocol for CA 19-9.
▪ Load the prepared pleural fluid specimens into the
sample racks or trays.
▪ Follow the analyzer's instructions to start the analysis.
▪ Ensure that the samples, controls, and reagents are
properly loaded and the correct assay is selected.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ Review the instrument printout for all analyte values.
◦ Validate the results ensuring they fall within the assay's
analytical measuring range.
◦ Results are to be recorded and transmitted to the
Laboratory Information System (LIS) for review.
◦ Any sample that produces questionable or out-of-range
results should be reanalyzed, preferably on a different
instrument, if available.
9. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
◦ Reference Range: The standard reference range for CA
19-9 levels in pleural fluid should be provided in the assay's
package insert. This range should be verified periodically
based on patient population study.
◦ Discuss abnormal findings with the clinical pathologist if
necessary.
10. SAMPLE INTEGRITY
◦ Check for any sign of hemolysis, contamination, or improper
handling, which might affect the results.
◦ Document any issues affecting sample integrity, and
possibly request a redraw if necessary.
11. TROUBLESHOOTING
◦ In the event of assay failure or QC outside acceptable limits,
repeat the assay with a new reagent lot or different analyzer.
◦ Consult the instrument manual and manufacturer’s technical
support for assistance.
12. REFERENCES
◦ Manufacturer’s Instructions for Use (IFU) for the CA 19-9
Immunoassay Kit.
◦ Laboratory Quality Control and Assurance Policy.
13. DOCUMENTATION
◦ Maintain logs for temperature monitoring, calibration, quality
control, and maintenance records.
◦ Ensure proper recording and archiving of all test results.
This protocol ensures standardized and reliable results for the
determination of CA 19-9 levels in pleural fluid, thus aiding in the
diagnostic process for patient management.
