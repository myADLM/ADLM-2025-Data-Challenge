Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for CARBOHYDRATE
ANTIGEN 19-9 (CA 19-9), SERUM
1. PRINCIPLE AND PURPOSE
To provide accurate and precise measurement of CA 19-9 levels in
serum utilizing a specific immunoassay method. The CA 19-9 test is
commonly used in the monitoring of pancreatic cancer and other
malignancies.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
• Acceptable and Preferred: Serum collected by venipuncture in a
serum separator tube (SST).
◦ Ensure specimen is handled according to standard
venipuncture procedures.
◦ Allow blood to clot at room temperature for 30 minutes.
◦ Centrifuge the SST for 10-15 minutes at 1,300-1,800 xg.
• Stability:
◦ Serum is stable at 2-8°C for up to 7 days.
◦ For long-term storage, serum samples may be frozen at -20°C
or below.
• Unacceptable:
◦ Specimens with severe hemolysis.
◦ Lipemic or icteric specimens need careful evaluation.
◦ Samples stored at room temperature for more than 8 hours
should not be used.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Immunoassay Analyzer (e.g., Roche Cobas e411, Abbott Architect
i2000)
• Reagents and calibrators specific to CA 19-9
• Quality control materials
• Pipettes and tips (if manual specimen handling is required)
• SST collection tubes
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation
1. Ensure the immunoassay analyzer is calibrated and quality
control (QC) has been run. Equip the analyzer with loaded
reagents specific to CA 19-9.
2. Verify that the specimen (serum) is properly processed and
centrifuged.
B. Calibration
1. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for the calibration
procedure.
2. Use the provided CA 19-9 standards and calibrators.
3. Document the calibration results and ensure the values are
within acceptable limits.
C. Quality Control (QC)
1. Run low, medium, and high-level QC samples in accordance
with laboratory protocol and manufacturer guidelines.
2. Confirm QC results are within the established ranges before
proceeding with patient samples.
3. Document all QC results in the appropriate QC log.
D. Testing Patient Samples
1. Load the processed serum specimens onto the immunoassay
analyzer.
2. If manual pipetting is required, use appropriate pipettes to
aliquot patient sample into the assay specific microwells/tubes.
3. Follow the analyzer instructions for initiating the test run.
4. Upon test completion, the analyzer will generate CA 19-9
results.
E. Post-Analysis
1. Review and interpret the CA 19-9 assay results.
2. Verify results against control results to ensure accuracy and
precision.
3. Record results and perform necessary calculations as required.
4. REPORTING RESULTS
5. All CA 19-9 results are automatically transmitted to the
Laboratory Information System (LIS).
6. Ensure results are reviewed, verified, and indicated for clinical
interpretation.
7. Critical values, if identified, must be promptly communicated to
the physician as per established laboratory policy.
8. REFERENCE INTERVALS
The laboratory’s established reference intervals for CA 19-9 must be
utilized and documented. Typically, the reference interval is:
• CA 19-9: 0 to 37 U/mL
1. RESULTS INTERPRETATION GUIDELINES
• Elevated CA 19-9 levels may suggest malignancies such as
pancreatic cancer, colorectal cancer, gastric cancer, among
others.
• Interpretation of results should consider patient history and other
diagnostic procedures.
• Note: False positives can occur, especially related to benign
conditions like pancreatitis or liver disease.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to the manufacturer's package insert for specific assay
limitations and interfering factors.
• High-dose hook effect may lead to falsely low results. Dilution
must be considered in extremely high-concentration samples.
1. QUALITY CONTROL AND MAINTENANCE
• Perform regular maintenance and cleaning of the analyzer as
outlined in the manufacturer’s manual.
• Document all maintenance activities.
• Regularly review and analyze QC data to identify potential trends
or issues with the assay.
