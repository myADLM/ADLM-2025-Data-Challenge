Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase for Generating Results for Carbohydrate
Deficient Transferrin, Adult, Serum
1. PURPOSE
This procedure outlines the steps for performing and generating
results for Carbohydrate Deficient Transferrin (CDT) testing in adult
serum samples. CDT testing is used to aid in the diagnosis of chronic
alcohol abuse.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel who are responsible for
performing CDT testing on serum samples.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing CDT
testing as per this SOP and ensuring the accuracy and validity of the
results.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Serum
• Collection Tube: SST (Serum Separator Tube) or plain red-top
tube
• Collection: Collect a minimum of 2 mL of serum.
• Handling: Allow the specimen to clot at room temperature for
30-60 minutes. Centrifuge the specimen to separate the serum.
• Stability: Serum samples are stable for up to 14 days at 2-8°C.
For long-term storage, freeze at -20°C or colder.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• HPLC or other authorized CDT assay instrument
• Calibrators and controls specific to the CDT assay
• Pipettes and pipette tips (calibrated and verified)
• Vortex mixer
• Centrifuge
• Sample tubes and racks
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
6. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation
1. Before starting the assay, ensure that all equipment is
functioning properly and has been calibrated.
2. Review Quality Control (QC) results of the day to confirm that
the system is within acceptable ranges. Document the review.
B) Assay Preparation
1. Set up the CDT assay software on the instrument.
2. Prepare calibrators and controls according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
3. Allow all reagents and samples to come to room temperature
before use.
C) Sample Preparation
1. Vortex the serum samples for 15-30 seconds to ensure
homogeneity.
2. Label all reaction tubes corresponding to each sample, control,
and calibrator.
D) Assay Procedure
1. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for the assay procedure
of the specific CDT test kit:
◦ Pipette the appropriate volume of serum samples,
calibrators, and controls into respective wells or tubes.
◦ Add the necessary reagents to each sample as per assay
instructions.
◦ Mix well using a vortex mixer and place the samples on the
instrument for analysis.
2. Load the samples onto the HPLC or chosen instrument.
3. Initiate the analysis program according to the instrument's
standard operational protocol.
E) Intermediate Handling
1. During the run, monitor the system for any alerts or error
messages.
2. Ensure proper maintenance of the instrument, such as clearing
spent reagents and proper disposal of waste.
F) Result Generation and Verification
1. Once the analysis is complete, review the data and ensure that
all samples have been processed correctly.
2. Verify that control values fall within the established limits.
3. For any out-of-range QC or calibrator values, take corrective
actions as specified by the SOP for QC failure.
7. RESULT REPORTING
• Enter the verified results into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
• Ensure that the results are aligned with the clinical reference
ranges.
• If any unusual results are found, annotate them with appropriate
comments and notify the supervising technologist or pathologist
for further review.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run Low, Medium, and High-Level Controls at the beginning of
each assay to verify the accuracy and precision of the testing
system.
• Document all QC activities in the Quality Control log.
9. MAINTENANCE AND CALIBRATION
• Follow routine maintenance as per the instrument manufacturer's
guidelines.
• Document all maintenance activities.
• Perform recalibration of the instrument as required and document
the calibration results.
10. TROUBLESHOOTING
• Refer to the instrument’s troubleshooting guide for any errors or
alerts observed during the assay.
• Any anomalies must be documented, and corresponding
corrective actions should be taken and recorded.

12. DOCUMENTATION
• Record all assay-related activities, QC results, and calibrations in
the appropriate laboratory logs or LIS.
• Retain all records and logs according to laboratory policy and
regulatory requirements.
