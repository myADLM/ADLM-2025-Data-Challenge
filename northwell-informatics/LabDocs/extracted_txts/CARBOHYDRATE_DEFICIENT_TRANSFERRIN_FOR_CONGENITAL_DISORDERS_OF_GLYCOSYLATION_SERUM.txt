Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Determining
Carbohydrate Deficient Transferrin (CDT) for Congenital
Disorders of Glycosylation, Serum
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the quantification of
Carbohydrate Deficient Transferrin (CDT) in serum samples to aid in
the diagnosis and monitoring of Congenital Disorders of
Glycosylation (CDG).
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing the
assay, maintaining equipment, documenting results, and reporting
findings in a precise and accurate manner.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type:
• Serum
Collection Guidelines:
• Collect blood using standard venipuncture technique.
• Allow blood to clot for 30 minutes to 1 hour at room temperature.
• Centrifuge the specimen at 1500xg for 10-15 minutes to separate
serum from clot.
• Transfer the serum into a clean, appropriately labeled
polypropylene tube.
Storage and Stability:
• Specimens can be stored at 2-8°C for up to 72 hours post-
collection.
• For long-term storage beyond 72 hours, specimens should be
stored at -20°C or colder until analysis.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
• Serum that has been stored at 2-8°C for more than 72 hours or at
-20°C or colder for more than 6 months.
3. REAGENTS AND EQUIPMENT
Reagents:
• Standard CDT Assay Kit, with all reagents provided (calibrators,
controls, conjugates, wash buffers, substrate solutions).
• Deionized water for reagent preparation.
Equipment:
• Microplate reader with wavelength setting at 450nm (with 620 nm
reference filter).
• Microplate washer.
• Pipettes and pipette tips.
• Centrifuge.
• Vortex mixer.
4. PROCEDURE
Calibration and Controls:
• Prepare calibration standards and control reagents according to
the manufacturer’s instructions.
• Run all calibrators and controls in duplicate.
Sample Preparation:
• Thaw serum samples stored at -20°C or colder and bring them to
room temperature. Mix well by gentle inversion or vortexing.
• Dilute serum samples as per the assay kit instructions.
Assay Procedure:
Day Prior to Testing:
1. Set up and calibrate microplate reader and washer according to
manufacturer specifications.
2. Prepare wash buffer, conjugate, substrate solution, and stop
solution as required by the assay kit instructions.
Assay Day:
1. Add the specified volume of calibrator, control, and patient
sample to the assigned microplate wells.
2. Add assay buffer and incubate the plate as instructed.
3. Wash the microplate wells thoroughly after incubation.
4. Add conjugate and incubate.
5. Wash the wells again post-incubation.
6. Add substrate solution and allow the enzymatic color reaction to
develop.
7. Add stop solution to terminate the reaction.
8. Read the absorbance at 450nm (with a reference at 620nm).
5. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include both low and high-level controls in each run to ensure
assay performance.
• Acceptable control ranges should be determined and documented
prior to running patient samples.
• If controls do not fall within the acceptable range, do not report
patient results. Determine the source of error, correct it, and
repeat the entire assay.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
• Utilize calibration curve generated from the calibrator absorbance
readings to quantify CDT levels in patient serum samples.
• Report results in percentage (%) of total transferrin.
7. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Normal: CDT < 1.3%
• Clinical decision threshold may be adjusted based on population
and clinical context.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolyzed or lipemic samples may lead to inaccurate results.
• Prolonged specimen storage or improper handling may degrade
transferrin, affecting assay accuracy.
9. SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS
• Handle all specimens as BIOHAZARDOUS material, following
universal precautions.
• Dispose of all biological materials, reagents, and sharps using
established biohazard protocols.

disorders of glycosylation.
