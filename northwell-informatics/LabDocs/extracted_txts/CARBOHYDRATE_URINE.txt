Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analysis of
Carbohydrate in Urine
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedures for the analysis
of carbohydrate levels in urine samples in order to ensure accurate
and reliable results. The protocol will describe the necessary steps
for handling, processing, and analyzing urine specimens to measure
carbohydrate content, as well as the appropriate documentation and
quality control procedures to maintain analytical integrity.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory staff are responsible for receiving, storing,
processing, and analyzing urine samples according to this SOP.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring that staff are trained and
proficient in the procedures and for addressing any issues that
arise during the analysis.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred/acceptable: Freshly voided urine collected in a clean,
labeled container. The specimen should be processed within 6
hours of collection. Specimens in BD Vacutainer Urinalysis
Preservative Tubes are acceptable for up to 72 hours at 4-25°C,
with an ideal volume of 7-9 ml.
• Unacceptable: Specimens received more than 6 hours after
collection (for non-preserved specimens) or more than 72 hours
after collection in preservative tubes. Specimens without
collection date/time indicated on the sample container or
requisition.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Urine containers
• BD Vacutainer Urinalysis Preservative Tubes
• Analytical balance
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Urine carbohydrate test reagent
• Timer
• Spectrophotometer or appropriate colorimetric reader
• Quality control materials (positive and negative controls)
• Laboratory logbook or electronic recording system
1. PROCEDURE
A) Specimen Preparation:
1. Ensure that the urine specimen is at room temperature before
analysis.
2. Mix the urine sample by gently inverting the container.
3. If necessary, centrifuge the urine sample to separate any
sediment and use the supernatant for testing.
B) Reagent Preparation:
1. Prepare the urine carbohydrate reagent according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
C) Analysis:
1. Label test tubes accordingly (patient ID, control, and blank).
2. Pipette a specific volume of urine (as per reagent
manufacturer's instructions) into labeled test tubes.
3. Add the prescribed volume of carbohydrate reagent to each test
tube, including controls and blanks.
4. Mix the contents thoroughly by vortexing or gentle inversion.
5. Incubate the mixture for a specified time at a specific
temperature (refer to reagent instructions), typically at 37°C for
5 minutes to 30 minutes.
6. Measure the optical density using a spectrophotometer or
colorimetric reader at the appropriate wavelength indicated by
the reagent's package insert.
D) Quality Control:
1. Run positive and negative control materials alongside patient
samples.
2. Document the results of the controls in the logbook/electronic
system.
3. Ensure that controls fall within the established acceptable
range. If controls are out of range, troubleshoot and repeat the
analysis.
4. REPORTING RESULTS
5. Calculate the carbohydrate concentration in the urine samples
using the standard curve generated from known standards.
6. Record the quantitative results in the laboratory information
system (LIS) and verify the data.
7. Review and validate the results before reporting them.
8. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• The laboratory-specific reference intervals should be used for the
interpretation of urine carbohydrate results.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to the manufacturer's package insert for any limitations
associated with the analytical method.
• Interference from substances (e.g., ascorbic acid, medications)
present in the urine can affect the accuracy of results.
1. RECORD KEEPING AND DOCUMENTATION
• Maintain documentation of all specimen processing, quality
control measures, and results in the laboratory logbook or
electronic system.
• Ensure that corrective actions and any deviations from the SOP
are documented and reviewed by a supervisor.
