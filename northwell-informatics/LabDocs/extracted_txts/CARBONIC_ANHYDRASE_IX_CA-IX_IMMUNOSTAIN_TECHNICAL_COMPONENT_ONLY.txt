CARBONIC ANHYDRASE IX (CA-IX) IMMUNOSTAIN
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for performing the CARBONIC
ANHYDRASE IX (CA-IX) immunostain, a technical component in the
laboratory setting. This protocol ensures accurate and consistent
staining results that do not include interpretation or diagnosis for
samples that have already been collected, received, and
accessioned.
Responsibility:
All designated laboratory personnel are responsible for following this
protocol. It is the responsibility of the laboratory supervisor to ensure
compliance with these procedures.
2. DEFINITION
CARBONIC ANHYDRASE IX (CA-IX) is an enzyme that can be
detected using immunohistochemistry in paraffin-embedded tissue
sections. This staining is typically used in the evaluation of various
carcinomas, particularly renal cell carcinoma.
3. PROCEDURE
A. Reagents and Supplies:
• CA-IX primary antibody
• Secondary antibody (linked to a detecting enzyme such as
horseradish peroxidase)
• Detection kit (e.g., DAB substrate kit)
• Buffered formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections
• Xylene
• Ethanol (in serial dilutions)
• Distilled water
• Antigen retrieval solution (e.g., citrate buffer, pH 6.0)
• Blocking solution
• Hematoxylin
• Mounting medium
• Coverslips
• Positive and negative control slides
B. Equipment:
• Microtome
• Water bath
• Incubator
• Automated immunostainer (if available)
• Humidity chamber (for manual staining)
• Light microscope
C. Procedure Steps:
1. Preparation of Slides:
a. Cut 4-5 micron thick sections from formalin-fixed, paraffin-
embedded blocks using a microtome. b. Float sections on a
water bath at 40-42°C to flatten them and then pick up with
glass slides (specimen slides). c. Allow slides to dry at room
temperature overnight or for 1 hour in a 60°C oven.
2. Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
a. Deparaffinize sections in xylene for 3 changes of 5 minutes
each. b. Rehydrate sections through descending grades of
ethanol (100%, 95%, 70%, and 50%) for 3 minutes each. c.
Rinse sections in distilled water for 5 minutes to remove any
residual ethanol.
3. Antigen Retrieval:
a. Perform antigen retrieval by immersing slides in citrate buffer
(or another appropriate antigen retrieval solution) and heating
them in a microwave or pressure cooker for 20 minutes. b.
Allow slides to cool in the buffer solution for 20 minutes at room
temperature. c. Rinse sections in distilled water for 5 minutes.
4. Blocking Non-Specific Binding:
a. Treat sections with a blocking solution for 5-10 minutes to
prevent non-specific binding of antibodies. b. Blot away excess
blocking solution without washing.
5. Primary Antibody Incubation:
a. Incubate sections with the CA-IX primary antibody dilution as
recommended by the manufacturer for 30-60 minutes at room
temperature in a humidity chamber.
6. Washing:
a. Wash slides 3 times with PBS or TBS buffer, 5 minutes each
time.
7. Secondary Antibody Incubation:
a. Incubate sections with the secondary antibody (linked to a
detection enzyme) according to the manufacturer's instructions
for 30 minutes at room temperature in a humidity chamber.
8. Washing:
a. Wash slides 3 times with PBS or TBS buffer, 5 minutes each
time.
9. Detection:
a. Apply the DAB substrate solution to the tissue sections and
incubate for 2-10 minutes or until the desired intensity of
staining is achieved. b. Monitor the reaction under a
microscope.
10. Counterstaining:
a. Rinse slides in tap water. b. Counterstain with hematoxylin
for 1-2 minutes. c. Rinse slides in tap water and blue in a mild
alkaline solution (e.g., lithium carbonate or ammonia water).
11. Dehydration and Mounting:
a. Dehydrate sections through ascending grades of ethanol
(50%, 70%, 95%, and 100%) for 1 minute each. b. Clear
sections in 3 changes of xylene for 3 minutes each. c. Mount
sections with a permanent mounting medium and coverslip.
12. Quality Control:
a. Include positive and negative control slides with each
staining batch. b. Verify staining quality before releasing the
results.
13. Documentation and Reporting:
a. Document the lot numbers of antibodies and reagents used.
b. Record any deviations from the protocol.
4. QUALITY CONTROL AND TROUBLESHOOTING
• Ensure all reagents are within expiry dates.
• Follow manufacturer's instructions for antibody dilutions and
incubation times.
• Regularly maintain and calibrate all equipment used in the
procedure.
• If staining issues occur, review each step to ensure procedural
accuracy.
