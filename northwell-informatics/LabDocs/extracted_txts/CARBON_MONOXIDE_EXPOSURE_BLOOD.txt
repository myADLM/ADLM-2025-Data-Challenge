Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Carbon Monoxide Exposure, Blood
1. PURPOSE
This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) outlines the steps
required to accurately analyze and report blood carbon monoxide
levels in the laboratory. This ensures consistency, reliability, and
accuracy in the detection and quantification of carboxyhemoglobin
(COHb) for diagnosing carbon monoxide exposure.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory staff, including medical laboratory scientists
and technologists, are responsible for carrying out the analysis
according to this procedure. It is the responsibility of the laboratory
supervisor to ensure adherence to these procedures, validate results,
and implement any necessary corrective actions.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Acceptable Specimens:
• Blood gas syringes containing low concentration or electrolyte-
balanced lithium heparin.
• Heparinized vacutainers (dark green or PST).
Collection Instructions:
• After specimen procurement, ensure that any air in contact with
the specimen is expelled, remove the needle, cap the syringe,
and mix the blood sample thoroughly.
• Ensure the tube is completely filled to maintain appropriate
heparin concentration and anaerobic conditions.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Blood collected with sodium citrate, sodium fluoride/oxalate, or
EDTA.
• Blood collected in evacuated blood collection tubes (e.g.,
Vacutainers or Microtainers) is not acceptable.
• Specimens with significant air bubbles (>10% of total volume).
• Specimens with clots.
1. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Verify and log the specimen upon receipt.
2. Inspect the specimen for any discrepancies or integrity issues
(e.g., clots, significant air bubbles). Reject any unsuitable
samples per criteria listed above.
Analysis on ABL90 Blood Gas Analyzer:
1. Ensure the ABL90 Blood Gas Analyzer is calibrated and internal
quality control (QC) has been performed as scheduled.
2. Select the COHb analysis option on the ABL90 analyzer.
3. Introduce the specimen into the analyzer per manufacturer's
instructions.
4. Wait for the analysis to be completed and results to be
generated.
Reporting Results:
1. Review results immediately to confirm there are no alert
indicators or message codes that could suggest the results are
flawed.
2. Verified results are automatically transferred to the Laboratory
Information System (LIS), where they should be reviewed for
quality assurance.
3. Report the COHb result as part of the patient’s blood gas panel.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
Internal Quality Control:
• Perform three levels of QC material analysis automatically
scheduled by the ABL90 analyzer.
• If QC fails for any analyte, follow manufacturer's guidelines and
laboratory protocols to troubleshoot.
Correlation Studies:
• Perform and document comparisons between multiple ABL90
analyzers at least monthly.
• Document patient comparison results in the designated
spreadsheet for review.
1. CORRECTIVE ACTIONS
For Out-of-Range QC Results:
1. Re-calibrate the analyzer and reconfirm internal QC.
2. If discrepancies persist, cross-check with a second ABL90
analyzer.
3. In case of continued failure, consult the on-call supervisor for
additional guidance.
For Specimen Integrity Issues:
• If hemolysis or other concerns are noted, centrifuge a small
aliquot and reassess.
• Document and communicate any specimen issues to the patient’s
care team for possible re-collection.
