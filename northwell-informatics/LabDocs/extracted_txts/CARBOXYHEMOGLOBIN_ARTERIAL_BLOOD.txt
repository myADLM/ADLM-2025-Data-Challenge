Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical
Phase of Generating Results for Carboxyhemoglobin,
Arterial Blood
1. Purpose
To establish a standardized procedure for accurately measuring and
reporting carboxyhemoglobin levels in arterial blood specimens,
ensuring the highest quality and reliability of test results.
2. Definition
Carboxyhemoglobin is the compound formed by the binding of
carbon monoxide to hemoglobin. Measuring carboxyhemoglobin
levels is crucial for diagnosing carbon monoxide poisoning and for
monitoring exposure in individuals at risk.
3. Specimen Requirements and Stability
Specimen Type:
• Arterial blood collected in a blood gas syringe containing either
low concentration or balanced lithium heparin.
Specimen Handling:
• Immediately after collection, ensure that any air in contact with the
blood specimen is expelled.
• Remove the needle from the syringe and firmly cap the syringe.
• Thoroughly mix the blood specimen to ensure even distribution of
the anticoagulant.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens collected in evacuated blood collection tubes (e.g.,
Vacutainers or Microtainers).
• Specimens with significant proportions (>10%) of air bubbles.
• Specimens with needles attached.
• Specimens that have clotted.
• Blood collected in Microtainers.
4. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies
Equipment:
• ABL90 Blood Gas Analyzer or equivalent blood gas analyzer with
CO-oximetry capability.
Reagents:
• Quality control materials for blood gas analysis.
Supplies:
• Vented or non-vented blood gas syringes.
• Lithium heparin.
5. Procedure
A) Specimen Collection and Transport:
1. Collect arterial blood in a blood gas syringe containing low
concentration or balanced lithium heparin.
2. Expel any air from the syringe, cap the syringe, and mix
thoroughly.
3. Transport the specimen to the laboratory immediately using the
pneumatic tube system or a transportation worker. Ensure the
specimen is placed in a plastic bag for transport.
B) Analysis:
1. Verify specimen integrity. If integrity is in question, centrifuge a
small aliquot to check for issues such as hemolysis.
2. Load the specimen into the ABL90 Blood Gas Analyzer.
3. Follow manufacturer instructions for measuring
carboxyhemoglobin levels.
C) Quality Control:
1. Automatically analyze three levels of quality control material
according to the set schedule. The limits are verified as
acceptable by the vendor.
2. If quality control fails for any analyte, do not report results for
that analyte until the issue is resolved.
6. Reporting Results
A) Result Verification:
1. Review and verify results automatically transmitted to the LIS.
2. Ensure results are within the expected range and check for any
anomalies in the reporting.
B) Critical Results:
1. Critical results may include carboxyhemoglobin levels indicative
of carbon monoxide poisoning and should be managed
according to institutional protocol.
C) Sample Integrity Issues:
1. If hemolysis is detected, follow guidelines for reporting
potassium and other affected analytes.
2. For oximetry values over 100%, report as 100%.
D) Troubleshooting:
1. Address any printed results with a question mark or message
code by reviewing the instrument logs and repeating the
analysis if necessary.
7. References
• Manufacturer’s instructions for ABL90 Blood Gas Analyzer.
• Institutional guidelines for handling and reporting critical values.
• Internal quality control procedures documented in the laboratory
manual.
8. Documentation
• Record all specimen details, quality control results, and any
corrective actions undertaken during the analytical phase in the
laboratory information system (LIS).
• Ensure accurate documentation and communication of critical
results to clinicians as per facility guidelines.
By following this SOP, laboratory personnel will ensure consistent
and accurate measurement of carboxyhemoglobin levels in arterial
blood, thereby supporting the clinical management of patients
exposed to carbon monoxide.
