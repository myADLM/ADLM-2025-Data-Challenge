Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analysis of
Carboxyhemoglobin, Central Venous
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to outline the steps required to
accurately analyze central venous blood specimens for
carboxyhemoglobin using a blood gas analyzer. The procedure
ensures that all results generated are consistent, accurate, and
reliable, thereby ensuring quality patient care.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all designated laboratory personnel to follow
this SOP accurately. Laboratory supervisors are responsible for
ensuring that all staff are adequately trained and competent to
perform this procedure. Any deviations or abnormalities must be
reported to a supervisor immediately.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
• Specimen Types Accepted: Central venous blood collected in a
balanced lithium heparin blood gas syringe.
• Specimen Handling: Immediately after specimen procurement,
expel any air in contact with the blood specimen, remove the
needle, cap the syringe, and ensure the blood is adequately
mixed.
• Unacceptable Specimens:
◦ Sodium citrate, sodium fluoride/oxalate, EDTA specimens.
◦ Specimens with significant air bubbles (>10% of specimen
volume).
◦ Specimens collected with needle attached.
◦ Clotted specimens.
• Specimen Stability: Specimens must be transported to the lab
immediately after collection. Delays may compromise analyte
stability.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• ABL 90 Blood Gas Analyzer.
• Balanced Lithium Heparin Blood Gas Syringe (recommended).
• Centrifuge (for sample integrity verification, if necessary).
• Necessary reagents as per ABL 90 analyzer requirements.
1. PROCEDURE
A) Specimen Processing:
1. Upon receipt, inspect the specimen for proper labeling, air
bubbles, and clot formation.
2. Mix the blood gently if separated.
3. If the specimen is deemed unacceptable, follow the proper
rejection protocol.
B) Analysis:
1. Load the specimen into the ABL 90 Blood Gas Analyzer
following the manufacturer's instructions.
2. Select the appropriate test profile for carboxyhemoglobin.
3. Initiate the analysis by pressing the designated start button on
the analyzer.
4. Monitor the analysis process for any error messages or
abnormalities.
C) Quality Control:
1. Ensure that internal QC procedures are followed:
◦ Three levels of QC material (low, normal, and high) should
be automatically analyzed according to the set schedule.
◦ If the QC fails, the analyzer will not provide a result. Follow
the troubleshooting steps as outlined in the QC protocol.
2. If QC checks indicate a problem, rerun the quality control and
patient samples on another analyzer, if available.
D) Result Reporting:
1. Results are automatically transmitted to the Laboratory
Information System (LIS) and must be reviewed and verified by
the technologist.
2. Should sample integrity be in question, centrifuge a small
aliquot to check for hemolysis or other issues.
3. Critical results must be reported following the laboratory's
critical value policy.
4. If carboxyhemoglobin values exceed 100%, report as 100%.
E) Troubleshooting:
1. Analyte not Reportable:
◦ If the analyzer returns a ‘?’ mark or message code, review
the instrument message logs, then repeat the analysis
preferably on an alternate analyzer.
◦ If issues persist, report the result with no value and add the
smart phrase indicating “Analyte unavailable due to
instrument error.” Contact the on-call for direction if needed.
2. pO2 Code 0094 for Cord Blood Gas Only:
◦ If pO2 value is below the reportable range (<10), type in a
number less than 10 for it to automatically adjust in the
system.
3. Temperature-controlled Analysis:
◦ Ensure the analyzer operates within specified temperature
and humidity ranges for accuracy.
4. REFERENCE INTERVALS
No definitive reference interval for carboxyhemoglobin is provided in
this SOP. Consult the specific laboratory reference range for
interpretation of results.
1. REFERENCE MATERIALS
• Manufacturer's instructions for the ABL 90 Blood Gas Analyzer.
• Laboratory critical value policy.
• QC protocol and reference manual.
