STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP) FOR ANALYSIS OF
CARBOXYHEMOGLOBIN IN PULMONARY ARTERY BLOOD
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to provide standardized and reliable
methods for the analysis of carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) in pulmonary
artery blood samples. This procedure outlines the steps and quality
control measures to ensure accurate and timely reporting of test
results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
All laboratorians are responsible for following this SOP and ensuring
accurate and precise measurement of carboxyhemoglobin. It is the
duty of supervisory staff to validate new equipment, oversee training,
and manage any deviations from the standard procedure.
3. SCOPE
This SOP applies to the analysis of carboxyhemoglobin levels in
pulmonary artery blood samples using the ABL90 blood gas analyzer
or any other designated analyzer in the laboratory.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
• Preferred Specimen Type: Heparinized whole blood collected in
a balanced lithium heparin-treated syringe.
• Collection Procedure: Ensure that air in contact with the blood
specimen is expelled. The needle is removed, the syringe is
capped, and the blood is adequately mixed.
• Transport Conditions: Specimens should be transported
immediately to the laboratory.
• Unacceptable Specimens:
◦ Specimens with significant air bubbles (>10%).
◦ Specimens received in evacuated blood collection tubes.
◦ Specimens received with a needle attached.
◦ Specimens that have clotted.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• ABL90 blood gas analyzer.
• Lithium Heparin-treated syringes.
• Quality control materials (low, normal, and high levels).
6. PROCEDURE
6.1. Preparation and Calibration
• Perform daily maintenance and calibration of the ABL90 analyzer
as per manufacturer’s instructions.
• Ensure internal quality controls are within acceptable ranges
before processing patient samples.
6.2. Sample Handling
1. Verify that the pulmonary artery blood sample is appropriately
labeled and accompanied by a requisition form.
2. Inspect the sample for clots or air bubbles. Reject any samples
that do not meet acceptance criteria.
3. Mix the blood sample thoroughly by gently rotating the syringe.
6.3. Sample Analysis
1. Loading the Sample:
◦ Open the sample inlet of the ABL90 analyzer.
◦ Aspirate the blood sample into the sample inlet of the
analyzer following manufacturer’s operation instructions.
2. Analyzing the Sample:
◦ Initiate the analysis by selecting the appropriate test profile
for carboxyhemoglobin.
◦ Monitor the screen for any error messages during the
analysis process.
6.4. Result Interpretation and Reporting
1. Upon completion, results will be displayed on the analyzer
screen.
2. Verify that results are within the linear range of the instrument
and free of any error codes or flags.
3. If critical results are observed (e.g., COHb levels ≥10%), follow
the laboratory’s critical results reporting policy.
6.5. Quality Control
• Run quality control samples at three levels (low, normal, high) as
per the laboratory’s quality management plan.
• Document and review control results in compliance with
established acceptance criteria.
• In case of a control failure, do not report patient results until
successful resolution and re-running of quality controls.
7. DOCUMENTATION
• Record results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Maintain a log of all control results, calibration data, and actions
taken for any out-of-control results.
8. TROUBLESHOOTING
• Consult the analyzer’s troubleshooting guide for any error
messages.
• If recurrent issues arise, contact technical support for the analyzer
and document all steps taken in the maintenance log.
9. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's instructions for the ABL90 analyzer.
• Laboratory internal quality control and calibration guidelines.
• Relevant clinical laboratory standards and regulatory
requirements.
By adhering to this SOP, laboratory staff will ensure consistent and
accurate determination of carboxyhemoglobin levels in pulmonary
artery blood samples, providing essential diagnostic information for
patient care.
