Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase:
Carboxyhemoglobin, Venous, Blood
1. PURPOSE To outline the steps for the accurate measurement
and reporting of venous carboxyhemoglobin levels in blood
specimens, using the standard analytical procedure in the
laboratory.
2. SCOPE This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel
responsible for the analysis of venous blood for
carboxyhemoglobin.
3. RESPONSIBILITY Laboratory technologists are responsible for
performing carboxyhemoglobin analysis and ensuring the
accuracy of the results. Supervisors are responsible for
verifying results and ensuring adherence to this SOP.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
• Specimen Type: Venous blood
• Collection Device: Blood gas syringe or heparinized vacutainer
(dark green or PST). Ensure that the tube is completely filled to
maintain anaerobic conditions.
• Unacceptable Specimens: Specimens with significant air
bubbles (> 10% of the specimen volume), specimens with
needles attached, clotted specimens, or samples collected in
sodium citrate, sodium fluoride/oxalate, or EDTA tubes.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• ABL90 Blood Gas Analyzer
• Heparinized blood gas syringe or heparinized vacutainer
• Quality Control materials for blood gas analysis
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
1. PROCEDURE A. Specimen Collection and Preparation
2. Collect venous blood in a heparinized blood gas syringe or dark
green/PST heparinized vacutainer.
3. Ensure the specimen has minimal exposure to air. Expel air
bubbles and mix the blood thoroughly.
4. Label the specimen correctly and ensure it is transported to the
lab immediately.
B. Analytical Procedure
1. Calibrate the ABL90 Blood Gas Analyzer as per the
manufacturer's instructions.
2. Perform internal quality control checks using three levels of QC
material according to the set schedule. Verify that QC results
are within acceptable limits before proceeding.
3. Place the patient sample into the analyzer as per the
manufacturer’s guidelines.
4. Input the patient identification information into the analyzer.
C. Analysis and Result Interpretation
1. Run the sample analysis on the ABL90 Blood Gas Analyzer.
2. If the analyzer flags any results with a “?” or message code,
refer to the instrument’s troubleshooting guide and reanalyze
the sample if necessary. Report results without issues.
3. If results are questionable, a small aliquot can be centrifuged to
check for integrity issues such as hemolysis.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform bi-weekly intralab correlations with patient samples to
ensure consistency across multiple analyzers.
• Monthly external QC checks against established standards.
• Validate new solution packs or sensor cassettes by performing a
3-patient comparison or analyzing a single patient sample if the
previous lot number remains unchanged.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Transmit results to the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
automatically.
• Review and verify the results through LIS before final reporting.
• For critical results, follow the Critical Results policy for immediate
notification and documentation.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS Refer to site-specific reference
intervals for carboxyhemoglobin levels.
2. METHOD LIMITATIONS Refer to the ABL90 Blood Gas
Analyzer user manual for limitations related to the analysis of
carboxyhemoglobin.
3. TROUBLESHOOTING AND MAINTENANCE
• Follow the manufacturer's guidelines for instrument maintenance
and troubleshooting.
• Any persistent issues should be reported to the supervisor for
further action.
