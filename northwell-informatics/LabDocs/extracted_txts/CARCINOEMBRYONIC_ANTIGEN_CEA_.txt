Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Carcinoembryonic Antigen
(CEA) Analysis
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this protocol is to describe the procedure for
measuring Carcinoembryonic Antigen (CEA) levels in patient
samples using the specified testing method. This procedure ensures
accurate, precise, and reproducible measurement of CEA levels,
which plays a crucial role in monitoring cancer progression and
treatment response.
1. DEFINITION
CEA is a glycoprotein involved in cell adhesion and is commonly
used as a tumor marker, particularly in cancers of the gastrointestinal
tract.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENT
Preferred Specimen:
• Serum (collected in a red-top tube or an SST) or Plasma
(collected in a heparin or EDTA tube)
◦ Volume: 2-3 mL
◦ Stability: Specimens are stable for up to 48 hours at 2-8°C.
For longer storage, freeze at -20°C.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples may affect the test results
and should be avoided when possible.
• Samples collected in non-compatible anticoagulants (such as
fluoride oxalate).
Handling and Transport:
• Serum or plasma must be separated from cells within 2 hours of
collection.
• Specimens must be transported to the laboratory on ice if not
analyzed within 4 hours of collection.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• Chemiluminescent immunoassay (CLIA) analyzer or similar
immunoassay analyzer
• CEA reagent kits specific to the analyzer
• Quality control (QC) materials (low, medium, and high levels)
• Calibrators
• Laboratory glassware and plasticware as needed
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation
1. Review and log patient specimen information.
2. Inspect specimens for integrity (e.g., check for hemolysis,
lipemia, or icterus).
B. Calibration
1. Perform calibration according to the manufacturer’s instructions
using CEA calibrators.
2. Ensure calibration is completed before running patient samples.
3. Document calibration data in the appropriate logbook.
C. Quality Control
1. Analyze QC samples at low, medium, and high levels at the
start of each run, after every 24-hour period, and after any
maintenance or troubleshooting.
2. Document results and verify that QC results fall within the
acceptable range before analyzing patient specimens.
D. Sample Analysis
1. Load patient specimens, calibrators, and QC materials onto the
analyzer.
2. Program the analyzer with the patient and QC sample
identifiers.
3. Initiate the run according to the analyzer’s operating procedure.
4. Review results for any flags or errors. Repeat analysis if
necessary.
E. Reporting Results
1. Verify and validate results according to laboratory protocol.
2. Enter results into the laboratory information system (LIS).
3. Include comment for results that fall outside the reference
range or if any repeat testing was necessary due to initial
analysis errors.
F. Post-Analytical Phase
1. Archive specimens in a designated storage location, ensuring
traceability.
2. Dispose of biohazard waste in accordance with institutional and
regulatory guidelines.
3. Document assay run details (e.g., date, time, operator initials,
any issues encountered) in the laboratory logbook.
4. REFERENCE INTERVALS
CEA Levels:
• Non-smokers: 0 - 3.0 ng/mL
• Smokers: 0 - 5.0 ng/mL
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Interfering substances: Hemolysis, lipemia, and icterus can affect
results.
• Heterophile antibodies and autoantibodies may interfere with the
assay.
• CEA is not recommended for cancer screening and must be
interpreted alongside clinical findings.

applications
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Maintain regular QC and proficiency testing as per laboratory
policy.
• Document all corrective actions taken if QC results fall outside
established limits.
