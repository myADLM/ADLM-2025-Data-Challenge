Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analysis of
Carcinoembryonic Antigen (CEA) in Pancreatic Cyst Fluid
1. PURPOSE To describe the method for the analytical measurement
of Carcinoembryonic Antigen (CEA) in pancreatic cyst fluid samples
to ensure accurate and reliable results for diagnostic purposes.
2. SCOPE This procedure applies to the analysis of pancreatic cyst
fluid samples for the presence of Carcinoembryonic Antigen (CEA) in
the clinical laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY Laboratory technologists are responsible for
performing the analysis and documenting results. It is the
responsibility of laboratory supervisors to ensure compliance with this
SOP and address any issues that arise during testing.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS Preferred/Storage Conditions:
• Pancreatic cyst fluid specimens should be collected in a sterile
container.
• Store specimens at 2-8°C and analyze within 72 hours of
collection. If analysis cannot be performed within 72 hours, freeze
the specimen at -20°C or lower.
Unacceptable Conditions:
• Specimens with visible hemolysis, contamination, or improper
labeling.
• Specimens not stored under appropriate conditions as outlined.
5. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• CEA Quantification Kit (validated for use with pancreatic cyst fluid)
• Calibrators and control materials from the CEA quantification kit
• Micropipettes and tips
• Vortex mixer
• Sample tubes or vials
• Sterile deionized water
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
6. EQUIPMENT
• Calibrated immunoassay analyzer
• Centrifuge
• Refrigerator (2-8°C)
• Freezer (-20°C or lower)
7. PROCEDURE
7.1. Preparation:
1. Wear personal protective equipment (PPE) including lab coat,
gloves, and safety glasses.
2. Ensure all reagents and samples are brought to room
temperature before use and the instrument is calibrated and
ready for analysis.
7.2. Specimen Handling:
1. Upon receipt, record the condition and storage status of each
specimen.
2. Centrifuge the sample at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes to remove
any particulate matter.
7.3. Test Setup:
1. Follow the manufacturer's instructions pertaining to the
preparation of reagents and calibration of the immunoassay
analyzer.
2. Prepare reagents and calibrators as per kit instructions.
3. Run quality control samples with known low, medium, and high
levels of CEA to ensure the accuracy and precision of the
assay.
7.4. Sample Analysis:
1. Pipette the specified volume of calibrator, control, and patient
sample into the respective wells or tubes.
2. Perform the assay according to the specific protocol provided
with the CEA quantification kit.
3. Carefully follow incubation times and washing steps as detailed.
7.5. Detection:
1. Measure the absorbance or signal from the assay as directed
by the kit instructions.
2. Ensure sample and control data are accurately recorded and
entered into the laboratory information system (LIS).
8. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Quality control samples must be run with each batch of patient
samples.
2. Review control values for accuracy and document any variance
outside acceptable limits.
3. If QC results fall outside of the acceptable range, delay patient
sample analysis and troubleshoot per instrument and kit
guidelines.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Results are generated by the immunoassay analyzer and
automatically transmitted to the LIS.
2. Technologists must manually review and verify results before
they are issued.
3. Flag any results that fall outside of normal reference intervals or
are critical values according to laboratory policies and notify the
appropriate clinical personnel.
10. REFERENCE INTERVALS Reference ranges for CEA in
pancreatic cyst fluid should be established in coordination with
clinical inputs, where applicable. Often ranges specific for pancreatic
cyst fluid might not be applicable, so clinical correlation is imperative.
11. METHOD LIMITATIONS Refer to the kit insert for any limits
specific to the reagents or method. Clearly, state the method is
intended for pancreatic cyst fluid and alteration in matrix versus
standard serum/plasma could affect outcomes.

13. DOCUMENTATION
1. Maintain all logs for specimen receipt, analysis date, time, and
technologist initials.
2. Document any deviations, equipment malfunctions, or
corrective actions taken.
3. Retain quality control records and calibration logs per
laboratory SOP and regulatory requirements.
This SOP aims to be comprehensive and user-friendly to ensure
accurate results for the diagnosis and management of pancreatic
cysts. Adherence is mandatory for the credibility of the assay
outcomes and patient care integrity.
