Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Carcinoembryonic
Antigen (CEA) Testing in Peritoneal Fluid
1. PURPOSE
To provide a detailed procedure for the measurement of
Carcinoembryonic Antigen (CEA) in peritoneal fluid samples,
ensuring accurate and reproducible results.
1. SCOPE
This SOP applies to the analysis of peritoneal fluid samples for the
presence and quantification of CEA in a CLIA-certified laboratory.
1. PRINCIPLE
Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is a tumor marker that can be
elevated in malignancies, including gastrointestinal cancers. The CEA
assay utilizes immunoassay techniques for the detection and
quantification of CEA levels within peritoneal fluid specimens.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
Qualified laboratory personnel are responsible for:
• Performing the assay according to this SOP.
• Ensuring that all reagents and equipment are prepared and
functioning correctly.
• Documenting all quality control and patient results accurately.
• Reporting any deviations from the protocol to designated
supervisors.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND UNACCEPTABLE
SPECIMENS
Preferred/Acceptable:
• Peritoneal fluid collected in sterile containers with no
anticoagulants.
• Sample volume: Ideally 5 mL of peritoneal fluid.
Unacceptable:
• Specimens containing visible hemolysis.
• Specimens with bacterial contamination.
• Specimens not stored or transported correctly (not at 2-8°C until
analysis if not processed immediately).
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• CEA Immunoassay kit.
• Microplate reader or automated analyzer compatible with the
immunoassay.
• Calibrators, controls, and reagents as specified in the kit insert.
• Personal protective equipment (PPE) including gloves and lab
coat.
• Sterile transfer pipettes and/or automated pipetting system.
• Vortex mixer.
• Centrifuge with appropriate rotor.
1. STORAGE AND STABILITY
• Store reagents as per the manufacturer's instructions.
• Control specimens should be stored at 2-8°C (or as specified by
the manufacturer) and should not be used past their expiration
date.
1. PROCEDURE
Specimen Preparation:
1. Label all sample tubes with patient identification number and
other requisite information.
2. Centrifuge peritoneal fluid samples at 1500 x g for 10 minutes
to remove any particulate matter.
Assay Procedure:
1. Allow all reagents, calibrators, controls, and peritoneal fluid
samples to reach room temperature prior to analysis.
2. Follow the specific instructions provided in the CEA
Immunoassay kit insert for the setup and execution of the
assay, including volumes to be pipetted, incubation times, and
temperatures. Typical steps involve: a. Pipetting calibrators,
controls, and peritoneal fluid samples into designated wells. b.
Addition of enzyme-conjugate reagent. c. Incubation of the
plate for a specified period. d. Washing steps to remove
unbound material. e. Addition of substrate solution and
subsequent incubation. f. Addition of stop solution to halt the
enzyme reaction.
3. Measure the optical density (OD) at the specified wavelength
(usually 450 nm) using a microplate reader.
4. Calculate concentrations of CEA in the peritoneal fluid samples
by reference to the calibration curve generated from the
calibrators.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run quality control samples (high and low CEA levels) with each
batch of patient samples to ensure assay validity.
• Document all quality control results and take corrective actions if
controls are out of acceptable range before proceeding with
patient sample analysis.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Display results in ng/mL.
• Verify results against quality control data.
• Report results following laboratory protocol and ensure they are
reviewed and signed off by a qualified laboratory personnel.
• Indicate if any sample integrity issues were observed and how
they were managed.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Normal Reference Interval for CEA in peritoneal fluid: Typically
less than 5 ng/mL (verify with method-specific reference
intervals).
1. LIMITATIONS
• Hemolysis, lipemia, or icterus can interfere with the assay. Avoid
samples with such interferences.
• Results must be interpreted in the clinical context including other
diagnostic procedures.
1. DOCUMENTATION AND RECORD KEEPING
• Maintain records of all results, quality control data, reagent lot
numbers, and calibration curves in accordance with laboratory
policies.

• CEA Immunoassay Kit Package Insert
• Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) Guidelines
• Manufacturer's Manual for Equipment and Assay Reagents
1. REVISIONS
• Document all revisions to this SOP with dates, and provide
training for all laboratory staff upon updates or changes.
