Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analysis of
Carcinoembryonic Antigen (CEA) in Pleural Fluid
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this protocol is to provide standard procedures for the
analysis of Carcinoembryonic Antigen (CEA) in pleural fluid samples
in a clinical laboratory setting. This ensures consistent, accurate, and
reliable test results.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
All designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing
this procedure as outlined. It is the responsibility of the laboratory
technologist to identify any issues that may affect test results and
report them to the supervisor.
1. DEFINITIONS
• CEA: Carcinoembryonic Antigen, a tumor marker used primarily
to diagnose and manage certain types of cancers.
• Pleural Fluid: Fluid collected from the pleural cavity surrounding
the lungs.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Automated immunoassay analyzer (e.g., Cobas e411, Abbott
Architect, Siemens ADVIA Centaur)
• CEA test kit specific to the analyzer being used, including
calibration and control reagents
• Pleural fluid collection kit
• Personal protective equipment (PPE) - gloves, lab coat, face
mask
• Centrifuge
• Appropriate vials and containers
• Specimen transport bag
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Preferred Specimen:
• Pleural fluid collected aseptically
• Minimum volume: 5 mL pleural fluid
• Stored and transported at 2-8°C
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens with significant hemolysis, contamination or
inappropriate storage conditions
• Specimens received in incorrect containers
• Specimens received without proper labeling or documentation
1. PROCEDURE
Specimen Processing:
1. Accessioning:
◦ Verify patient identification and specimen labeling on
receiving pleural fluid sample.
◦ Record specimen details in the laboratory information
system (LIS)
2. Preparation:
◦ Centrifuge pleural fluid sample at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes
to remove cellular debris.
◦ Transfer the supernatant into a clean, appropriately labeled
container.
3. Analysis:
◦ Perform a calibration check on the immunoassay analyzer
according to manufacturer's instructions.
◦ Load the CEA test kit and pleural fluid sample into the
analyzer.
◦ Ensure the analyzer has the correct parameters set for
pleural fluid samples.
◦ Run appropriate quality control samples before analyzing
patient samples.
◦ Analyze the pleural fluid sample for CEA levels.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run quality control samples (low, medium, high) at the start of
each batch to ensure the accuracy of test results.
• Document the results of quality control materials.
• If QC failures occur, do not proceed with patient sample analysis
until the issue is resolved.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Verify and review results from the analyzer for accuracy.
• Enter validated results into the LIS.
• Report results as CEA concentration in ng/mL.
Reference Intervals:
• Refer to site-specific reference ranges for CEA levels.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to the manufacturer's insert for limitations specific to the
CEA assay.
• CEA levels may be elevated in non-malignant conditions such as
inflammation or infection.
1. ACTIONABLE AND CRITICAL RESULT GUIDELINES
• Alert supervisor and/or physician immediately for critical results or
results significantly higher than reference interval.
• Follow standard operating procedures for handling and reporting
critical laboratory results.
