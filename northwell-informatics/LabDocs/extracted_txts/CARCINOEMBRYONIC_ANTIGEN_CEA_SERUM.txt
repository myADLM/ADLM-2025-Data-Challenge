Standard Operating Procedure Title: Analytical Phase Procedure for
Serum Carcinoembryonic Antigen (CEA) Testing
1. PURPOSE
This procedure outlines the process for the analytical phase of testing
serum samples for Carcinoembryonic Antigen (CEA) levels using an
appropriate automated immunoassay analyzer.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
Qualified laboratory personnel are responsible for performing the
CEA assay, ensuring the accuracy and precision of the test results,
and maintaining appropriate documentation and quality control
procedures.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENT
• Specimen Type: Serum
• Collection Container: Gel-barrier tube (SST) or plain red-top tube
• Specimen Stability:
◦ Room Temperature: 24 hours
◦ Refrigerated (2-8°C): 72 hours
◦ Frozen (< -20°C): 1 month
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Automated Immunoassay Analyzer
• CEA Reagent Kit
• Quality Control (QC) Samples (Low, Medium, High)
• Calibrators specific to CEA assay
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes and Tips
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
1. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation:
1. Ensure serum samples are appropriately labeled and
accessioned.
2. Allow samples to clot if using non-gel tubes.
3. Centrifuge the samples at 1500-2000 x g for 10 minutes to
separate serum from clot.
4. Transfer the clear serum to a clean secondary tube if required.
B. Instrument Preparation:
1. Turn on the immunoassay analyzer and allow it to perform self-
checks.
2. Load reagent kits, calibrators, and quality control materials onto
the analyzer as per the manufacturer's instructions.
3. Ensure that the analyzer is properly calibrated using the
provided calibrators.
C. Quality Control:
1. Run QC samples (Low, Medium, High) to ensure the analyzer's
accuracy before processing patient samples.
2. Document the QC results, and verify they are within acceptable
ranges.
3. If QC results are outside acceptable limits, troubleshoot and
resolve any issues before proceeding.
D. Sample Analysis:
1. Program the analyzer with the necessary patient and QC
sample information.
2. Load serum samples into the analyzer.
3. Initiate the CEA assay process on the analyzer.
4. Allow the analyzer to process the samples and obtain CEA
results.
E. Result Verification:
1. Review the analyzer-generated results for any flagged or error
messages.
2. Verify the results against the QC data to ensure validity.
3. Document any observed issues or necessary corrective
actions.
F. Reporting Results:
1. Transmit the verified CEA results to the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
2. Ensure results are reviewed and authorized by supervisory
personnel before releasing them to the clinicians.
3. LIMITATIONS AND INTERFERENCES
• Hemolysis, lipemia, and icterus in serum samples may interfere
with the accuracy of the CEA assay.
• Consultation with the analyzer’s package insert or technical
manual is recommended for detailed interference information.
1. QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE
• Perform regular maintenance and calibration of the immunoassay
analyzer according to the manufacturer's instructions.
• Adhere to quality control protocols to ensure the reliability of test
results.
• Document all maintenance, QC runs, calibrations, and corrective
actions in the appropriate log books.
