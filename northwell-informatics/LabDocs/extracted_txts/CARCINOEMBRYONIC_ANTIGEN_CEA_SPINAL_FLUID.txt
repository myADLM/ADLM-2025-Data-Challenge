SOP for Carcinoembryonic Antigen (CEA) Analysis in
Spinal Fluid
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the analysis of
Carcinoembryonic Antigen (CEA) in spinal fluid samples using
automated immunoassay instrumentation, ensuring accurate,
reliable, and timely results.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to the clinical laboratory performing CEA
analysis on spinal fluid samples using an automated immunoassay
analyzer.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
All designated laboratory personnel are responsible for:
• Performing the analysis as outlined in this SOP.
• Ensuring all equipment is calibrated and maintained appropriately.
• Documenting and reporting results accurately.
• Implementing corrective actions if required.
4. SPECIMEN COLLECTION AND ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
• Specimen Type: Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) collected by lumbar
puncture.
• Acceptable Volume: Minimum 1 mL of CSF.
• Storage: Specimens should be kept at 2-8°C and analyzed within
48 hours of collection. If analysis cannot be performed within 48
hours, specimens can be frozen at -20°C for up to 1 month.
• Unacceptable Specimens:
◦ Specimens collected in non-sterile containers.
◦ Specimens received in the laboratory more than 48 hours
post-collection (if not frozen).
◦ Specimens with physical contamination or excessive
hemolysis.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Automated immunoassay analyzer (e.g., Roche Cobas e601).
• CEA reagent kits.
• Calibrators and controls specific to CEA analysis.
• Sterile collection tubes.
• Personal protective equipment (PPE).
6. PREPARATION OF REAGENTS AND CALIBRATORS
• Reagents should be prepared and stored according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
• Reagent expiration dates should be monitored and expired
reagents should be discarded.
• Perform calibration with CEA specific calibrators before starting
the analysis.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run internal quality controls at the beginning of each shift and
whenever a new reagent kit is used.
• Two levels of controls (high and low) should be used to ensure
assay precision and accuracy.
• Document all quality control results in the Quality Control Log.
8. PROCEDURE
1. Sample Preparation:
◦ Allow refrigerated samples to come to room temperature.
◦ Mix the sample gently to ensure homogeneity.
◦ Ensure samples are free of blood and particulate matter.
◦ Transfer an appropriate aliquot of the CSF to the sample
cup.
2. Instrument Setup:
◦ Turn on and initialize the automated immunoassay analyzer.
◦ Load the CEA reagent kits, calibrators, and controls into the
analyzer.
◦ Perform instrument calibration according to manufacturer
guidelines.
3. Analysis:
◦ Load the samples into the designated sample rack of the
analyzer.
◦ Program the analyzer for CEA assay, ensuring all samples
are correctly identified.
◦ Start the analysis according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
◦ The instrument will automatically measure CEA levels in the
samples.
4. Result Review:
◦ Review all results generated by the analyzer.
◦ Verify against quality control and calibration standards.
◦ Results outside the reference range or flagged by the
instrument should be subjected to re-analysis or further
verification.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results must be reviewed and verified by a qualified technologist.
• Report the results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
following site-specific reporting guidelines.
• Critical results should be communicated to the requesting
physician immediately following established critical result
reporting procedures.
10. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the CEA reagent kit package insert for detailed method
limitations. Potential limitations include:
• Interference from high levels of hemoglobin, lipids, or bilirubin.
• The presence of heterophilic antibodies.
11. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions for the automated immunoassay
analyzer.
• CEA reagent kit package insert.
• Laboratory quality control guidelines.
12. DOCUMENTATION
• Maintain detailed records of all specimen handling, calibration,
quality control, and results in the laboratory documentation
system.
13. SAFETY
• All personnel must follow standard laboratory safety procedures,
including wearing appropriate PPE during sample handling and
analysis.
By following this SOP, laboratory personnel will ensure the precise
and accurate determination of CEA levels in spinal fluid samples,
thereby providing reliable information to assist in patient diagnosis
and management.
