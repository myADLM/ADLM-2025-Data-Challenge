Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Carcinoembryonic
Antigen (CEA) Monoclonal Immunostain, Technical Component
Only
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for performing CEA monoclonal
immunostain in the laboratory, detailing steps for appropriate staining,
quality control measures, and result documentation. This procedure
applies only to the technical component of generating results for the
Carcinoembryonic Antigen (CEA) test, and interpretation is performed
by a qualified pathologist.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
• Designated laboratory personnel (histotechnologists) are
responsible for performing the procedure as specified, including
handling reagents, performing the staining protocol, and
documenting results.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring staff adhere to the SOP
and addressing any technical issues that arise.
1. DEFINITIONS
Carcinoembryonic Antigen (CEA): A tumor marker used in
immunohistochemistry (IHC) for identifying and managing colorectal
cancer, among other malignancies.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Automated IHC staining machine (e.g., Ventana Benchmark,
Dako Autostainer)
• Microtome
• Water bath
• Incubator
• Slide rack
Reagents:
• CEA monoclonal antibody reagent
• Secondary antibody reagent (polymer-based or biotin-streptavidin
system)
• Detection system (e.g., DAB substrate)
• Antigen retrieval solution (e.g., citrate buffer pH 6.0 or EDTA
buffer pH 9.0)
• Blocking solution (e.g., hydrogen peroxide, protein block)
• Hematoxylin for counterstaining
• Mounting medium
Supplies:
• Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks
• Charged glass slides
• Cover slips
• ImmEdge™ hydrophobic barrier (optional for manual staining)
1. PROCEDURE
Specimen Preparation:
1. Section FFPE tissue blocks at 4-5 microns using a microtome.
2. Float sections on a water bath set at 40-45°C, then mount on
charged glass slides.
3. Dry slides at 37°C overnight or in an incubator at 60°C for 1-2
hours.
Staining Protocol:
1. Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
◦ Deparaffinize slides in xylene (3 changes, 5 minutes each).
◦ Rehydrate through a series of graded ethanols (100%, 95%,
70%) ending in distilled water.
2. Antigen Retrieval:
◦ Treat slides with antigen retrieval solution (citrate buffer or
EDTA) using a pressure cooker, microwave, or steamer for
the recommended duration, typically 20 minutes.
◦ Allow slides to cool in retrieval solution at room temperature
for 20 minutes.
◦ Rinse slides in distilled water followed by buffer wash (e.g.,
PBS or Tris-buffered saline).
3. Blocking:
◦ Apply blocking solution to sections to quench endogenous
peroxidase activity and block non-specific binding sites.
◦ Incubate for the recommended time specified by reagent
manufacturer, generally 10-20 minutes.
◦ Rinse slides in buffer wash.
4. Primary Antibody:
◦ Apply CEA monoclonal antibody reagent to each section.
◦ Incubate slides according to the manufacturer’s guidelines,
typically 30-60 minutes at room temperature.
◦ Rinse slides in buffer wash.
5. Secondary Antibody:
◦ Apply secondary antibody reagent or polymer-based
detection reagent.
◦ Incubate slides for the recommended time, usually 30
minutes.
◦ Rinse slides in buffer wash.
6. Detection:
◦ Apply chromogen (e.g., DAB substrate) to visualize the
binding of the antibody.
◦ Incubate slides while monitoring color development under a
microscope (2-10 minutes).
◦ Rinse slides in distilled water.
7. Counterstaining:
◦ Counterstain slides with hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes.
◦ Rinse in tap water and blue slides in a solution of ammonia
water or Scott's Tap Water Substitute.
◦ Dehydrate slides through graded alcohols and clear in
xylene.
8. Mounting:
◦ Apply coverslip using mounting medium.
9. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run positive and negative control slides with each batch of patient
slides to ensure the validity of the staining process.
• Document lot numbers of reagents and antibodies, and maintain a
log of stain runs, including control results.
• Review control slide results to confirm proper staining; positive
control must demonstrate expected positive staining, and
negative control must be free of specific staining.
1. RESULT DOCUMENTATION
• Document stain results in the laboratory information system (LIS)
or appropriate logbook.
• Record any deviations, issues, or corrective actions taken during
the staining process.
• Forward stained slides to the pathologist for interpretation.

safety data sheets (SDS) and institutional safety protocols.
• Dispose of waste materials, such as used reagents and tissue
sections, in accordance with hazardous waste disposal
guidelines.
