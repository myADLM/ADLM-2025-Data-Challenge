STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE
SOP Title: Analytical Phase Protocol for Generating Results for
Carcinoembryonic Antigen, Polyclonal Immunostain, Technical
Component Only
1. PURPOSE
This protocol outlines the procedure for the analytical phase of
generating results for Carcinoembryonic Antigen (CEA) polyclonal
immunostain - technical component only. The purpose is to ensure
accurate detection, imaging, and documentation of CEA expression
in tissue samples using immunohistochemical staining techniques.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory technologists are responsible for performing
the immunohistochemical staining and analysis. All laboratory
personnel must adhere to this protocol to ensure reliable and
reproducible results, reporting any deviations or issues to the
supervisor immediately.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND PREPARATION
Specimen Type:
• Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue sections
• Unstained tissue slides cut at 3-5 micrometers thick
Specimen Handling:
• Ensure tissue blocks are properly fixed and embedded in paraffin.
• Tissue sections should be cut using a microtome, floated in a
40°C water bath, and mounted on charged slides. Allow slides to
dry overnight at room temperature.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Tissue sections that are inadequately fixed
• Sections with excessive folds or artifacts
• Specimens not clearly labelled with patient information, collection
date, and relevant clinical history
3. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
Primary Antibody:
• Carcinoembryonic Antigen (CEA) Polyclonal Antibody
Secondary Antibody:
• Goat anti-rabbit IgG, horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated
Detection System:
• Diaminobenzidine (DAB) or similar chromogen substrate for
visualization
Equipment:
• Microtome
• Water bath
• Immunostaining apparatus (automated or manual staining
system)
• Light microscope
• Positive and negative control slides
4. PROCEDURE
A. Slide Preparation
1. Retrieve unstained FFPE tissue sections.
2. Place slides in a slide holder and heat in an oven at 60°C for 30
minutes.
B. Deparaffinization and Rehydration
1. Deparaffinize slides by immersing them in three changes of
xylene (3 minutes each).
2. Hydrate slides by sequentially immersing them in graded
alcohols (100%, 95%, and 70%) for 3 minutes each, followed
by immersion in distilled water.
C. Antigen Retrieval
1. Place slides in a pre-warmed citrate buffer (pH 6.0) at 95°C for
20 minutes.
2. Allow slides to cool in buffer at room temperature for 20
minutes.
3. Rinse slides in distilled water and PBS.
D. Staining Procedure
1. Block endogenous peroxidase activity by incubating slides in
3% hydrogen peroxide solution for 10 minutes.
2. Rinse slides in PBS.
3. Incubate slides in blocking solution for 10 minutes to reduce
nonspecific binding.
4. Apply primary CEA antibody and incubate in a humid chamber
at room temperature for 1 hour.
5. Rinse slides in PBS.
6. Apply secondary antibody (HRP-conjugated) and incubate at
room temperature for 30 minutes.
7. Rinse slides in PBS.
8. Apply DAB substrate and develop color by incubating for 5
minutes or until desired staining intensity is achieved.
9. Rinse slides in distilled water.
10. Counterstain with hematoxylin for 2 minutes.
11. Rinse slides in distilled water, followed by immersion in graded
alcohols and xylene for dehydration.
12. Mount coverslips using an appropriate mounting medium.
E. Quality Control
1. Include positive control tissues known to express CEA.
2. Include negative control tissues by omitting the primary
antibody to ensure specificity.
3. Inspect stained slides under a light microscope to confirm
proper staining and specificity.
5. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Document the presence or absence of CEA staining, noting the
pattern (cytoplasmic, membranous) and intensity (weak,
moderate, strong).
2. Compare staining to control slides to validate results.
3. Report findings in the Laboratory Information System (LIS),
ensuring proper linkage to patient records.

optimal staining conditions and troubleshooting tips. Consult standard
histological texts for guidelines on immunohistochemical techniques
and CEA interpretation.
