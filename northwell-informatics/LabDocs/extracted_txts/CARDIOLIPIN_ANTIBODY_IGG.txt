SOP for CARDIOLIPIN ANTIBODY, IGG Testing
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to provide guidance on the steps,
responsibilities, and criteria for generating and verifying the results of
CARDIOLIPIN ANTIBODY, IGG tests in the laboratory.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory technologists are responsible for performing
the CARDIOLIPIN ANTIBODY, IGG test and ensuring accurate and
timely generation of results. It is the responsibility of the laboratory
supervisor to ensure that all required protocols are strictly followed
and maintained.
1. DEFINITIONS
• CARDIOLIPIN ANTIBODY, IGG: An immunoglobulin G (IgG)
antibody targeting cardiolipin, used to diagnose antiphospholipid
syndrome and other autoimmune conditions.
• ELISA: Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay, a commonly used
laboratory test to measure antibodies.
• CLIA: Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments, regulations
governing laboratory testing.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• ELISA Reader and Washer
• Micropipettes and Tips
• CARDIOLIPIN ANTIBODY, IGG ELISA Kit (store as per
manufacturer’s instructions)
• Calibrators and Controls
• Deionized Water
• Incubator (37°C)
• Laboratory Bench Timer
• Plate Sealers
• Logbook or LIS for documentation
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation and Setup:
1. Ensure the ELISA reader and washer are calibrated and
maintained as per manufacturer's instructions.
2. Allow all reagents, controls, and patient samples to reach room
temperature prior to use.
3. Set the incubator to 37°C and pre-warm.
B. Sample Requirements:
1. Collect 5-10 mL of venous blood in a plain or serum separator
tube.
2. Centrifuge the sample to obtain serum, which should be stored
at 2-8°C if not tested immediately. For longer storage, serum
should be frozen at -20°C or lower.
3. Discard any hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
C. Assay Procedure:
1. Bring the 96-well microtiter plate from the CARDIOLIPIN
ANTIBODY, IGG ELISA Kit to room temperature and record the
layout in the logbook.
2. Dilute patient serum samples 1:101 with sample diluent (e.g.,
add 10 µL of serum to 1 mL of diluent).
3. Add 100 µL of calibrators, controls, and diluted samples to the
appropriate wells.
4. Cover the plate with a plate sealer and incubate at 37°C for 30
minutes.
5. Wash the plate 3 times with 300 µL of wash buffer per well.
6. Add 100 µL of conjugate to each well and incubate at room
temperature for 30 minutes.
7. Wash the plate 3 times with 300 µL of wash buffer per well.
8. Add 100 µL of substrate solution to each well and incubate at
room temperature for 15 minutes, protecting the plate from
light.
9. Add 100 µL of stop solution to each well to terminate the
reaction.
10. Read the optical density (OD) of each well at 450 nm within 15
minutes using the ELISA reader.
D. Data Analysis:
1. Calculate the mean OD of the calibrators, controls, and patient
samples.
2. Generate a standard curve using the OD values of the
calibrators.
3. Determine the concentration of CARDIOLIPIN ANTIBODY, IGG
in patient samples by extrapolating from the standard curve.
4. Verify that control values are within the designated range. If
controls are out of range, the run is invalid and must be
repeated.
5. REPORTING RESULTS:
6. Document the final results in the LIS or laboratory logbook.
7. Report CARDIOLIPIN ANTIBODY, IGG levels in units specified
by the manufacturer’s kit instructions.
8. Flag any results that exceed predefined critical values and
notify the supervising pathologist immediately.
9. QUALITY CONTROL:
10. Run high and low controls with each batch of tests.
11. Perform and document equipment calibration and maintenance
checks as per manufacturer's guidelines.
12. Participate in external proficiency testing programs as required.
13. REFERENCE INTERVALS:
The reference interval should be established based on the specific
patient population and the kit instructions: - Negative: < 15 GPL units/
mL - Borderline: 15-20 GPL units/mL - Positive: > 20 GPL units/mL
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
• Ensure complete adherence to kit instructions; deviations can
result in inaccurate results.
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples can interfere with the
analysis.
• Results should be interpreted in conjunction with clinical findings
and other laboratory tests.

• Manufacturer’s Manual for CARDIOLIPIN ANTIBODY, IGG ELISA
Kit.
• Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) guidelines.
• Relevant Laboratory Safety Procedures and Protocols.
1. REVIEW AND REVISION:
This SOP should be reviewed annually and revised as necessary to
incorporate new practices, technologies, or regulations.
This completes the Standard Operating Procedure for CARDIOLIPIN
ANTIBODY, IGG testing within our laboratory. All laboratory
personnel should be trained and familiar with this protocol to ensure
consistent and accurate results.
