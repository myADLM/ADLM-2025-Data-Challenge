SOP for Cardiolipin Antibody, IgM Testing
1. PURPOSE
This SOP is provided to ensure the analytical procedures for the
determination of Cardiolipin Antibody, IgM are performed accurately
and reproducibly for optimal patient outcomes. Cardiolipin antibody
testing is critical for diagnosing autoimmune disorders such as
antiphospholipid syndrome.
Responsibility:
Qualified laboratory staff are responsible for performing and
documenting all steps in the procedure, ensuring quality control
measures are maintained, and results are reported accurately.
Supervisors must ensure staff are trained and adhere to the SOP.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Acceptable Specimens:
• Serum: 5 mL collected in a red-top tube or serum separator tube
(SST).
• Plasma: 5 mL collected in an EDTA or heparin tube.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens with severe hemolysis or lipemia.
• Specimens collected in citrate or fluoride tubes.
• Specimens not properly labeled (missing date/time, or patient
identification).
Specimen Stability:
• Refrigerated specimen (2-8°C): stable for up to 7 days.
• Frozen specimen (-20°C or lower): stable for up to 30 days.
Specimens must be transported to the laboratory promptly to
preserve integrity.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Microplate reader capable of measuring at 450 nm.
• Pipettes and tips.
• Incubator set at 37°C.
• Centrifuge.
Reagents:
• Cardiolipin IgM ELISA Kit.
• Wash buffer.
• Substrate reagent.
• Stop solution.
• Quality control serum levels (positive and negative controls).
Supplies:
• Microtiter plates.
• Disposable pipette tips.
• Tubes for sample aliquoting.
1. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
• Allow reagents and samples to reach room temperature.
• Prepare wash buffer according to kit instructions.
Assay Procedure:
1. Add 100 µL of sample or control to the wells of the microtiter
plate.
2. Incubate for 30 minutes at 37°C.
3. Wash wells 5 times with wash buffer, ensuring complete
removal of liquid after each wash.
4. Add 100 µL of enzyme conjugate to each well.
5. Incubate for 30 minutes at 37°C.
6. Wash wells 5 times with wash buffer.
7. Add 100 µL of substrate reagent to each well.
8. Incubate for 15 minutes at room temperature.
9. Add 100 µL of stop solution.
10. Read absorbance at 450 nm using the microplate reader.
11. QUALITY CONTROL
Quality Control Procedures:
• Run positive and negative controls with each assay batch.
• Verify that control results fall within the expected ranges specified
by the kit instructions.
1. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
Reference Intervals:
• Negative: <20 MPL units.
• Indeterminate: 20-40 MPL units.
• Positive: >40 MPL units.
Reporting Results:
• Enter results into the LIS and verify accuracy.
• Critical values should be flagged and communicated to the
appropriate healthcare provider promptly.
Notes:
• Any unusual absorbance readings or inconsistencies should
trigger a repeat assay.
• Record all applicable data including results, lot numbers of
reagents, date of testing, and initials of the technician.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Potential interferences and limitations are typically outlined in the kit
insert. Ensure sample integrity to minimize false positives or
negatives.
