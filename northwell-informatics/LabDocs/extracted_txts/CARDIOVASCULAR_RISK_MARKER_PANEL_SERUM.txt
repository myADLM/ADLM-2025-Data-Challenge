STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP) Title: Analytical
Procedure for Cardiovascular Risk Marker Panel, Serum
1. PURPOSE
To provide a detailed, standardized protocol for the analysis and
generation of results for the Cardiovascular Risk Marker Panel in
serum samples to ensure accuracy, precision, and reproducibility of
results.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of all designated laboratory personnel to
perform the procedure as outlined and to ensure all equipment and
reagents are maintained according to the guidelines. Laboratory
supervisors are responsible for reviewing and documenting the
results, and ensuring all quality control measures are in place and
adhered to.
1. DEFINITION
The Cardiovascular Risk Marker Panel typically includes evaluation
of the following markers: Total Cholesterol, High-Density Lipoprotein
(HDL) Cholesterol, Low-Density Lipoprotein (LDL) Cholesterol,
Triglycerides, Apolipoprotein A1 (ApoA1), Apolipoprotein B (ApoB),
and Lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a))
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen type: Serum Preferred/acceptable: - Collect blood in a
serum separator tube (SST). - Allow the blood to clot for a minimum
of 30 minutes. - Centrifuge the specimen at 3,000 rpm for 10 minutes
to separate serum. - Aliquot the serum into a labeled transfer tube if
required. - Store serum samples at 2-8°C if analysis is to be
performed within 72 hours; for longer storage, freeze samples at
-20°C or lower.
Unacceptable: - Hemolyzed or lipemic samples (significantly lipemic
samples may interfere with results). - Samples that have not been
properly labeled or documented.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• CLIA-certified automated analyzer calibrated for the specified
tests
• Quality control material (Low, Normal, High)
• Calibrators for specific markers
• Refrigerators and freezers for sample storage
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Serum separator tubes (SST)
• Transfer tubes
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform quality control checks for each cardiovascular risk marker
at the beginning of each day of testing and whenever a new
reagent or calibrator lot is used.
• Use three levels of control material: low, normal, and high.
• Document all quality control activities in the appropriate log.
1. PROCEDURE
A) Initial Setup: - Turn on and calibrate the automated analyzer
according to the manufacturer's instructions. - Confirm that the
reagent and calibrator lots are documented and within their expiration
dates.
B) Sample Analysis: - Load patient serum samples onto the analyzer
as per the manufacturer's guidelines. - Run the Cardio Risk Marker
Panel, ensuring the following markers are included: Total Cholesterol,
HDL-Cholesterol, LDL-Cholesterol, Triglycerides, ApoA1, ApoB, and
Lp(a). - Record temperatures and ensure the analyzer is operating
within specified limits.
C) Quality Control: - Run quality control samples (low, normal, high)
with each batch of patient samples. - Evaluate quality control results
to ensure they fall within the acceptable range. Address any out-of-
range results immediately by following corrective actions as per
laboratory protocol. - Document all results and actions taken in the
QC log.
D) Results Verification and Reporting: - Once samples are analyzed,
review the results for accuracy and consistency. - Verify that all
results meet the laboratory’s quality control criteria. - Enter results
into the Laboratory Information System (LIS) for final review by a
designated technologist. - Validate results and release for reporting.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING & CORRECTIVE ACTIONS
• If a sample fails initial QC or shows suspect results, re-analyze
using a fresh aliquot of the serum sample.
• Check reagent and calibrator performance. Recalibrate the
analyzer if necessary.
• Document any troubleshooting and corrective actions taken in the
instrument log.
1. REPORTING RESULTS:
Refer to site-specific reporting guidelines. The reference intervals for
each cardiovascular risk marker should be clearly stated in the
laboratory’s result report.
• Critical values should be flagged and immediately communicated
to the relevant healthcare provider following the laboratory’s
protocol for critical result notification.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS:
• Total Cholesterol: Optimal <200 mg/dL
• HDL-Cholesterol: Low <40 mg/dL for men, <50 mg/dL for women
• LDL-Cholesterol: Optimal <100 mg/dL
• Triglycerides: Optimal <150 mg/dL
• Apolipoprotein A1 (ApoA1): 120-180 mg/dL
• Apolipoprotein B (ApoB): 80-180 mg/dL
• Lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)): <30 mg/dL
1. LIMITATIONS:
• Hemolyzed or lipemic samples may interfere with assay
performance.
• Fasting is recommended prior to sample collection for accurate
triglyceride measurement.
• Refer to specific assay inserts for each marker for additional
limitations.
