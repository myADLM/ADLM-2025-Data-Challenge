Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Generating Results for
CARMINE DYE/RED DYE COCHINEAL (DACTYLOPIUS COCCUS)
IGE (RED # 4)
1. PURPOSE
This SOP describes the analytical procedures for generating results
for Carmine Dye/Red Dye Cochineal (Dactylopius coccus) IgE (Red #
4) to ensure consistent, accurate, and reliable test results.
Responsibility: It is the responsibility of laboratory personnel to
perform the analysis as outlined in this procedure and to document
all necessary data accurately.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/Acceptable Specimen:
• • Serum: Minimum of 1 mL serum collected in a serum separator
tube (SST) or red-top tube.
• • Plasma: Minimum of 1 mL plasma collected in an EDTA,
heparin, or citrate tube.
Unacceptable Specimen:
• • Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric specimens.
• • Specimens stored at room temperature for more than 8 hours.
• • Insufficient specimen volume (less than 1 mL).
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• • Centrifuge
• • Pipettes and tips
• • Specific IgE assay kit for Carmine Dye/Red Dye Cochineal IgE
• • ELISA reader or automated immunoassay analyzer
• • Calibrators and control materials specific for IgE
• • Reagent-grade water
• • Personal protective equipment (PPE)
1. PROCEDURE
A) Specimen Preparation:
• • Upon receipt, inspect the specimen for volume and conditions.
• • Centrifuge the specimen at 2000-3000 g for 10 minutes to
separate serum or plasma.
• • Aliquot serum/plasma into labelled tubes for analysis.
B) Calibration and Quality Control:
• • Run calibrators according to the manufacturer's instructions to
establish the standard curve.
• • Run quality control samples at both low and high concentrations
before patient samples.
• • Ensure all QC results are within acceptable ranges before
proceeding. If not, troubleshoot and resolve before continuing.
C) Assay Procedure:
• • Prepare reagent and control materials according to the
manufacturer's kit instructions.
• • Pipette the appropriate volume of specimen, calibrators, and
controls into their designated wells.
• • Add reagents as specified in the assay procedure, ensuring
thorough mixing and adherence to incubation times.
• • Wash wells as required to remove unbound components.
• • Add substrate solution and incubate for the time specified.
• • Terminate the reaction with stop solution, if applicable.
D) Analyzing Results:
• • Read the optical density (OD) of each well using an ELISA
reader or automated immunoassay analyzer set to the
appropriate wavelength.
• • Calculate the concentration of Carmine Dye/Red Dye Cochineal
IgE in patient samples using the standard curve generated from
calibrators.
• • Verify that control results fall within established ranges to ensure
assay validity.
E) Documentation and Reporting:
• • Record all raw data, calibration curves, and calculated results in
the laboratory information system (LIS).
• • Review and verify the results to meet quality and procedural
requirements.
• • Report results according to site-specific reporting guidelines.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• • Run QC samples with each batch of patient samples, and
document results in the QC log.
• • Ensure that all equipment, reagents, and assay kits are within
their expiration dates and function properly.
• • Follow all manufacturer guidelines for maintenance and
calibration of analytical equipment.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• • Results may be affected by grossly hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric
serum or plasma.
• • Cross-reactivity with other allergens or substances may cause
false-positive or false-negative results.
• • Follow specific assay insert guidelines for detailed limitations.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
The reference intervals should be based on the assay kit's package
insert or established laboratory norms, which often categorizes
results as:
• • Negative: <0.35 kU/L
• • Borderline/Equivocal: 0.35 – 0.69 kU/L
• • Positive: ≥0.70 kU/L
Important note: These values are general guidelines, and reference
intervals should be verified against lot-specific data from the assay kit
in use.
