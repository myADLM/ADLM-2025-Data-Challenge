Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Title: Analytical Phase:
Carnitine, Free and Total, Plasma
1. PURPOSE
This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) describes the steps
required for the analysis and reporting of Carnitine (Free and Total)
levels in plasma specimens. It ensures accurate and reproducible
results, maintaining compliance with CLIA regulations.
Responsibility: The designated laboratory staff, including medical
laboratory scientists and technicians, are responsible for following the
procedure as outlined. Supervisors are responsible for ensuring
compliance and addressing any deficiencies that may affect test
results.
1. DEFINITIONS
Carnitine: A compound involved in the transport of fatty acids into
mitochondria for beta-oxidation. Free Carnitine: The non-esterified
form of carnitine found in plasma. Total Carnitine: The sum of free
carnitine and acylcarnitines (esterified form) in plasma.
1. PROCEDURE
3.1 Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies
• Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) system,
or another validated analytical instrument suitable for carnitine
analysis.
• Calibrators and controls traceable to certified standards.
• Reagents for sample preparation, derivatization, and LC-MS/MS
analysis.
• Pipettes and tips (calibrated and traceable).
• Centrifuge.
• Sample vials and caps.
• Laboratory Information System (LIS) for data entry and result
reporting.
3.2 Sample Handling and Preparation
• Acceptable specimens: Plasma collected in EDTA or heparinized
tubes.
• Unacceptable specimens: Hemolyzed samples, improper storage,
or collected in inappropriate tubes.
• Minimum sample volume: 0.5 mL.
1. Upon receiving, log the specimen into the LIS.
2. Centrifuge the plasma sample at 1500 x g for 10 minutes to
remove any cellular debris.
3. Aliquot the clear plasma into designated sample vials.
4. Store aliquoted samples at -80°C if not analyzed immediately.
3.3 Assay Procedure
A. Sample Preparation
1. Thaw plasma samples at room temperature if frozen.
2. Pipette an appropriate volume of plasma into a new vial for
derivatization.
3. Add derivatization reagents according to the validated protocol
(e.g., butylation of carnitines).
4. Incubate samples as required for the derivatization reaction
(e.g., 20 minutes at 60°C).
5. After incubation, allow samples to cool to room temperature.
B. LC-MS/MS Analysis
1. Set up the LC-MS/MS system according to manufacturer
instructions and validated conditions for carnitine analysis.
2. Prepare mobile phases and check instrument calibration.
3. Inject a set of calibrators and quality control samples to
establish a calibration curve.
4. Inject prepared plasma samples into the LC-MS/MS system.
5. Record retention times, peak areas, and other relevant data for
each sample.
3.4 Quality Control
• Run quality control samples (QC) at the beginning and end of
each batch, as well as interspersed with patient samples.
• Acceptable QC ranges must be determined based on validated
criteria.
• If QC results fall outside acceptable ranges, investigate and
resolve issues before proceeding with patient samples.
3.5 Result Calculation and Verification
1. Calculate free and total carnitine concentrations using the
calibration curve generated from the calibrator injections.
2. Verify that samples and controls meet acceptance criteria
before releasing results.
3. Results must be reviewed, verified, and signed off by a qualified
laboratory professional.
4. Enter results into the LIS for automatic reporting to the
physician.
3.6 Reporting Results
Refer to site-specific reporting guidelines. Ensure all results are
consistent with clinical context and laboratory standards.
3.7 Method Limitations
Refer to manufacturer inserts and method validation documents for
potential limitations of the assay.
3.8 Documentation and Record Keeping
• Maintain records of all performed analyses, calibrations, quality
control, and instrument maintenance.
• Document corrective actions taken in response to any deviations
from standard procedures.
