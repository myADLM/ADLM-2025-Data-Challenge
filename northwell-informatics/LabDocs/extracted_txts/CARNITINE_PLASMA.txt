Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for CARNITINE, PLASMA
Assay
1. PURPOSE
This SOP describes the analytical procedure for the measurement of
carnitine levels in plasma samples. The goal is to ensure accurate,
precise, and reliable results through consistent application of the
outlined protocol.
Responsibility: The qualified laboratory staff is responsible for
performing the assay according to this procedure. Supervisors are
responsible for ensuring that staff follow this SOP and for addressing
any deviations or concerns that arise during the analytical phase.
1. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all plasma carnitine tests performed in the
laboratory.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
3.1 Specimen Type:
• Preferred: Plasma from EDTA-anticoagulated blood.
• Acceptable: Plasma from heparin-anticoagulated blood.
3.2 Collection and Handling:
• Collect blood in EDTA or heparin collection tubes.
• Immediately mix by gentle inversion to prevent clotting.
• Centrifuge the sample at 1500-2000xg for 10 minutes within 1
hour of collection.
• Carefully transfer the plasma to a polypropylene tube without
disturbing the cellular layer.
• Store plasma at -20°C or colder if analysis is not immediately
performed. Samples may be stored at -80°C for long-term
storage.
3.3 Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed samples
• Specimens received in sodium citrate or any tubes containing
additives not specified as acceptable.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
4.1 Equipment:
• High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) system with a
UV detector
• Centrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Micropipettes and tips
• Analytical balance
4.2 Reagents:
• Mobile Phase A Solution: 0.1% Formic acid in water
• Mobile Phase B Solution: 0.1% Formic acid in acetonitrile
• Carnitine standard solution
• Internal standard solution (D3-carnitine)
• Derivatization reagent, if applicable
• Calibration standards
• Quality control materials (QC low, QC high)
4.3 Supplies:
• HPLC columns specific for carnitine analysis
• Polypropylene tubes
• HPLC vials
• Disposable pipette tips
1. PROCEDURE
5.1 Preparation:
• Thaw plasma samples at room temperature completely before
use.
• Vortex to mix thoroughly.
• Prepare calibration standards and quality control materials as
described in specific assay instructions.
5.2 Sample Preparation:
• Transfer 100 µL of plasma to a polypropylene tube.
• Add 10 µL of internal standard solution (D3-carnitine).
• Vortex mix for 30 seconds.
• Optionally, if derivatization is required, proceed with the
appropriate reagent and incubation period as specified.
• Centrifuge at 14,000 rpm for 5 minutes.
• Carefully transfer the clear supernatant to an HPLC vial.
5.3 HPLC Analysis:
• Equilibrate the HPLC system with mobile phase A and B.
• Inject a volume as specified by the assay instructions (e.g., 10 µL)
of the prepared sample.
• Include injections of calibration standards and QC materials at the
beginning, end, and intervals throughout the sample runs.
• Monitor the chromatogram and ensure proper peak resolution and
retention time consistency.
5.4 Data Analysis and Interpretation:
• Identify carnitine peaks based on retention times compared to
standards.
• Calculate carnitine concentrations by comparing sample peak
areas to those of the calibration standards, accounting for the
internal standard.
• Verify the calibration curve is linear and within acceptable limits
for correlation (r^2 ≥ 0.99).
5.5 Quality Control:
• Run quality control samples (QC low and QC high) with each
batch of patient samples.
• Accept results only if QC values fall within the established range.
5.6 Reporting Results:
• Transmit validated results to the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
• Review and verify results before final reporting.
1. QUALITY ASSURANCE AND TROUBLESHOOTING
• Validate the precision and accuracy of the assay regularly using
control materials.
• Document any deviations or anomalies and report them to the
supervisor.
• If results are questionable, reanalyze the sample and/or run
additional quality control checks.
• Refer to the instrument manufacturer’s manual for troubleshooting
guidance and contact technical support as needed.
Note: Refer to specific instrument and reagent package inserts for
detailed instructions, limitations, and additional procedural
information.
