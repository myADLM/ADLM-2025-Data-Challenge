Carnitine, Random, Urine Analytical Phase SOP
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this protocol is to define the procedure for the
analytical phase in the generation of carnitine results from random
urine samples. This includes the steps for specimen preparation,
analysis using appropriate instrumentation, quality control, results
reporting, and troubleshooting.
Responsibility: All designated laboratory staff are responsible for
performing the procedures outlined in this SOP. Supervisors are
responsible for ensuring adherence to the SOP and addressing any
issues that arise during the analytical phase.
1. SPECIMEN
Acceptable Specimens:
• Random urine sample, preferably collected in a clean, dry
container with a secure lid.
• Volume should be sufficient for analysis, preferably at least 10
mL.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Samples not accurately labeled with patient information, collection
date, and time.
• Samples showing signs of contamination.
• Samples collected more than 24 hours prior to analysis without
proper preservation.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Spectrophotometer or Mass Spectrometer as appropriate for
carnitine quantitation
• Urine preservation reagents (if needed)
• Quality Control (QC) materials for urine carnitine
• Calibration standards for carnitine
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes and tips
• Clean, labeled conical tubes
1. PROCEDURE
Specimen Preparation:
1. Verify specimen adequacy and labeling.
2. Mix the specimen thoroughly.
3. If necessary, centrifuge the urine sample at 3,000 rpm for 5
minutes to remove any particulate matter.
Analyte Measurement:
1. Prepare the spectrophotometer or mass spectrometer for urine
carnitine analysis according to the instrument-specific SOP.
2. Calibrate the instrument using carnitine standards.
3. Prepare QC materials and ensure they are at room
temperature.
4. Set up the urine sample and QC samples in the instrument as
per the manufacturer’s instructions.
5. Run the analysis and record the carnitine levels for both the
urine sample and QC materials.
Quality Control:
1. Ensure that QC samples are included in each batch of analysis.
2. Verify QC results against the established ranges. If QC fails, do
not report patient results until the issue is resolved.
3. Record all QC sample results in the QC log.
Reporting Results:
1. Review the instrument-generated carnitine levels.
2. Validate the results with appropriate quality controls.
3. Enter the results into the LIS.
4. Report results according to site-specific guidelines.
5. If the results are critical, notify the physician as required by the
critical values policy.
6. TROUBLESHOOTING
Instrument Errors:
1. Refer to the instrument manual for error codes and
troubleshooting steps.
2. If unable to resolve the issue, contact technical support or the
designated supervisor.
QC Failures:
1. Re-run QC samples.
2. If QC fails again, recalibrate the instrument and re-run both QC
and patient samples.
3. If the issue persists, halt the analysis and contact the
supervisor for further instructions.
Analyte Interference:
1. If interference is suspected, review the patient history for
potential interferences (e.g., medications, dietary supplements).
2. Repeat the analysis if necessary.
3. Document all instances of interference and actions taken.

1. REVIEW AND UPDATE
This SOP must be reviewed annually to ensure compliance with
current laboratory standards and practices. Updates must be
approved by the laboratory director.
