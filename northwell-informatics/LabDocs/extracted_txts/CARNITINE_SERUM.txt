Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Carnitine, Serum:
1. PURPOSE
To provide standardized procedures for the accurate and precise
determination of serum carnitine levels in patient samples using liquid
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory technologists are responsible for conducting
the analysis, ensuring quality control measures are met, and
documenting results. Laboratory supervisors are responsible for
reviewing results and addressing any issues related to the procedure.
1. SPECIMEN
a. Preferred/Acceptable Specimen: - Serum: Collect 4 mL of blood in
a plain, red-top tube or serum separator tube (SST). Allow serum to
clot in an upright position for 30 minutes before centrifuging. -
Transport the serum to the laboratory within 2 hours of collection if
kept at room temperature, or store the serum sample at 2-8°C if
transported within 24 hours. For long-term storage, serum samples
should be frozen at -20°C or lower.
b. Unacceptable Specimen: - Specimens that have been hemolyzed.
- Specimens that have not been stored or transported under
appropriate conditions. - Specimens without proper labeling,
including the patient's name, date, and time of collection.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
a. Equipment: - Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry
(LC-MS/MS) system. - Centrifuge. - Micropipettes and tips. - Vortex
mixer. - Analytical balance.
b. Reagents: - Mobile phase reagents for LC-MS/MS (acetonitrile,
water, formic acid). - Carnitine calibration standards. - Internal
standard for carnitine. - Quality control samples.
c. Supplies: - Red-top tubes or SST tubes. - LC-MS/MS sample vials.
- Syringes and filters for sample preparation. - Gloves and lab coat.
1. PROCEDURE
a. Sample Preparation: 1. Centrifuge the serum sample at 1500 x g
for 10 minutes to separate the serum. 2. Transfer 100 µL of serum
into an LC-MS/MS sample vial. 3. Add 10 µL of internal standard
solution to each sample vial. 4. Vortex the vials for 1 minute to ensure
thorough mixing. 5. Filter the mixture using a syringe filter into a
clean LC-MS/MS sample vial.
b. Instrument Setup: 1. Set up the LC-MS/MS system according to
the manufacturer's instructions. 2. Prepare the mobile phase by
mixing acetonitrile, water, and formic acid in the appropriate ratios. 3.
Prime the LC-MS/MS system with the mobile phase and run initial
blank injections to equilibrate the system. 4. Calibration: Inject
carnitine calibration standards to create a calibration curve. The
instrument should generate a linear response across the expected
concentration range of carnitine. 5. Quality Control: Analyze quality
control samples at high, medium, and low concentrations to ensure
the system's accuracy and precision.
c. Sample Analysis: 1. Load the prepared serum sample vials into the
autosampler of the LC-MS/MS system. 2. Program the LC-MS/MS
method to include the chromatographic and mass spectrometric
parameters for detecting carnitine. 3. Inject each sample according to
the programmed method, ensuring duplicate injections for precision.
4. Monitor the LC-MS/MS system for any error messages or
deviations during the run.
d. Result Calculation: 1. Use the calibration curve generated during
instrument setup to calculate the concentration of carnitine in each
serum sample. 2. Verify the calculated concentrations using the
internal standard response. 3. Document and review results, and
ensure all calculated concentrations fall within the range of the
calibration curve.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
a. Perform quality control (QC) checks with each batch by including
at least two levels of QC samples (high and low concentration). b.
Review QC results before reporting patient results. Investigate and
document any deviations from acceptable limits. c. Re-run samples if
QC results are out of the acceptable range, and document corrective
actions taken.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
a. Document all patient results in the laboratory information system
(LIS). b. Review results for any critical values or discrepancies. If
necessary, take appropriate corrective action. c. Ensure that results
are validated and verified by the laboratory supervisor or designated
staff before releasing them to the healthcare provider.
1. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
Refer to established reference intervals for serum carnitine. Any
results outside of the reference range may indicate clinical conditions
that require further investigation by the healthcare provider.
