Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for CAROB, IGE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for the analysis of CAROB, IGE, SERUM
assays, ensuring accurate, reliable, and reproducible results within
the clinical laboratory setting.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing and
documenting the analysis of CAROB, IGE, SERUM according to the
outlined procedures. All staff must ensure the integrity of the assay
results and promptly report any discrepancies to the supervisor.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
• Specimen Type: Serum or plasma collected in SST or EDTA
tubes.
• Volume: Minimum 1 mL of serum or plasma.
• Stability: Specimens must be stored at 2-8°C for no more than 48
hours post-collection or frozen at -20°C for up to 6 months.
• Unacceptable Specimens: Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric
samples; specimens outside of specified storage conditions.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Automated Immunoassay Analyzer: E.g., Siemens Atellica IM
• Reagents: Specific CAROB, IGE, and SERUM assay kits
(purchase agreements as per vendor)
• Ancillary Supplies: Calibration materials, quality control
materials, sample cups, pipettes, tips, sterile gauze, gloves, and
waste containers.
1. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation
• Calibration: Prior to sample analysis, perform calibration of the
analyzer using manufacturer-specified calibrators for CAROB,
IGE, and SERUM assays. Document calibration results.
• Quality Control: Run internal quality control samples at two
levels (normal and abnormal), recording results in QC log.
Confirm acceptable ranges per manufacturer instructions.
B) Sample Analysis
1. Specimen Handling: Verify label accuracy against requisition
note. Discard any specimens that do not meet acceptance
criteria.
2. Loading Samples: Equilibrate serum samples to room
temperature. Load specimens into the analyzer sample
compartment appropriately.
3. Running Assays:
◦ Set up the assay run for CAROB, IGE, and SERUM in the
analyzer according to manufacturer instructions.
◦ Initiate assay program. Ensure data acquisition settings
match standard protocol.
4. Data Interpretation:
◦ Review assay results.
◦ Investigate any flagged results or anomalies as per
troubleshooting guide.
◦ Compare results with reference intervals for CAROB, IGE,
and SERUM.
5. Documentation:
◦ Record results in LIS.
◦ Document any corrective actions undertaken during the
analysis.
◦ Verify results and sign off as per site-specific reporting
guidelines.
C) Reporting Results
• Verification and Transmission: Results are auto-transmitted to
the LIS for review. Verify accuracy and transmission
completeness.
• Reference Intervals:
◦ CAROB: 0-10 µg/mL
◦ IgE: 0-100 IU/mL
◦ SERUM: 60-180 mg/dL
D) Troubleshooting and Corrective Actions
• If any assay’s QC fails, follow manufacturer troubleshooting steps.
• Document and notify supervisor of persistently aberrant results.
• Repeat critical values per site-specific guidelines.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Internal QC Monitoring: Run controls daily at designated
intervals and record observations.
• External Quality Assessments: Participate in external laboratory
proficiency testing programs.
1. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
• SOP Revision Date: October 2023
• Review Cycle: Annual or as needed for updates
• References: Manufacturer's product inserts for CAROB, IGE,
SERUM assays.
1. REVISIONS
• Record of Changes: Maintain a log of revisions to the SOP
including date, changes made, and justification.
