Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Carotene, Beta
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to provide clear and detailed instructions
for the analytical phase of generating results for Beta-Carotene in
serum/plasma samples in a CLIA-certified laboratory. This procedure
ensures accuracy, precision, and reliability of results, thereby
supporting effective patient diagnosis and treatment.
1. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all qualified personnel performing Beta-Carotene
analysis in the clinical laboratory.
1. DEFINITIONS
Beta-Carotene: An organic, strongly-colored red-orange pigment
abundant in plants and fruits. It is a precursor of vitamin A.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory personnel to
perform the Beta-Carotene analysis according to the procedures
outlined in this document. Laboratory supervisors are responsible for
ensuring staff competency and adherence to this SOP.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
a. Specimen Type: Serum or plasma.
b. Collection Container: Serum should be collected in a serum
separator tube (SST), while plasma can be collected in
heparinized tubes.
c. Volume: Minimum of 2 mL of serum/plasma.
d. Handling: Protect samples from light. Process samples
promptly or store at -20°C if not analyzed immediately.
2. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
a. High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) system
equipped with a UV-Vis detector.
b. Beta-Carotene standard.
c. HPLC-grade solvents (e.g., acetonitrile, hexane).
d. Micropipettes and tips.
e. Vortex mixer.
f. Centrifuge.
g. Amber vials for HPLC.
h. Calibration curves.
i. Specimen processing documentation forms.
3. PROCEDURE
A) Specimen Preparation:
i. Centrifuge the serum/plasma sample at 1500 x g for 10 minutes at
4°C to separate the phases.
ii. Transfer the supernatant to a clean amber vial to protect it from
light.
iii. Store processed samples at -20°C until analysis if not analyzed
immediately.
B) Standard and Calibration Curve Preparation:
i. Prepare a series of Beta-Carotene standard solutions at
concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 10 µg/mL using HPLC-grade
solvents.
ii. Prepare a calibration curve by running these standard solutions on
the HPLC system and recording their peak areas.
C) Sample Analysis:
i. Thaw frozen samples in a dark room and mix well using a vortex
mixer.
ii. Load 20 µL of each sample into the HPLC system.
iii. Inject each sample into the HPLC system using an autosampler.
iv. Analyze the samples using the set HPLC parameters, including
mobile phase composition, flow rate, column temperature, and
detection wavelength (450 nm for Beta-Carotene).
v. Record the retention times and peak areas for Beta-Carotene.
D) Calculation and Reporting of Results:
i. Compare the peak areas of the samples to the calibration curve to
determine the concentration of Beta-Carotene in each specimen.
ii. Calculate the concentration of Beta-Carotene in µg/mL.
iii. Document the results in the laboratory information system (LIS) for
verification by the laboratory supervisor.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
a. Run quality control (QC) samples (low, medium, high)
alongside patient specimens to ensure the accuracy and
precision of the assay.
b. Acceptable ranges for QC samples should be defined based
on historical data and manufacturer guidelines.
c. If QC results fall outside the acceptable range, troubleshoot
and correct the issue before proceeding with patient sample
analysis.
2. REPORTING RESULTS
i. Review and verify the calculated Beta-Carotene results.
ii. Report results in the LIS and ensure they are transmitted
accurately to the patient's electronic medical record (EMR).
3. METHOD LIMITATIONS
i. The method is sensitive to light; samples must be protected from
light at all stages of the procedure.
ii. Hemolysis, lipemia, and icterus may interfere with the analysis.

Adherence to this SOP will ensure the accurate and precise
determination of Beta-Carotene levels in patient serum/plasma
samples, thereby providing valuable information for patient diagnosis
and management.
