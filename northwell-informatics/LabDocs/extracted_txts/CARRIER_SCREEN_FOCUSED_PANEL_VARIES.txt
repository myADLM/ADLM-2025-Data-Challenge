Standard Operating Procedure
(SOP) for Carrier Screen,
Focused Panel, Varies Testing
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the protocol for the analysis and
generation of results for Carrier Screen, Focused Panel, Varies in a
CLIA-certified laboratory. This SOP ensures that all sample analyses
are performed in a standardized manner to maintain accuracy,
reliability, and repeatability.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to the analytical phase of generating results for
Carrier Screen, Focused Panel, Varies. It assumes that specimens
have already been collected, received, and accessioned.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• The laboratory technologists are responsible for performing the
analysis as outlined in this SOP.
• The laboratory supervisor is responsible for ensuring compliance
with this SOP and addressing any issues that arise during the
analytical process.
• All staff must be familiar with and adhere to this SOP.
4. PROCEDURE
4.1. PREPARATION
• Ensure all necessary equipment is calibrated and functioning
correctly.
• Verify the integrity and suitability of reagents and supplies to be
used for analysis. Discard expired or compromised materials.
• Review patient requisition and confirm that all required
information is available.
4.2. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
• Thermal cycler/PCR machine
• Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) equipment or other relevant
sequencing platforms
• Micropipettes and tips
• 96-well plates and seals
• Positive and negative control samples
• Reagents and samples for library preparation, including primers,
enzymes, buffers
• DNA extraction kits (if needed)
• Bioinformatics tools and software for analysis
4.3. SAMPLE PREPARATION
• Extract DNA from the samples if not previously done.
◦ DNA extraction kits should be used according to manufacturer
instructions.
◦ Measure the concentration and purity of extracted DNA using
a spectrophotometer/nanodrop.
• Dilute DNA samples to required concentrations (as specified by
the protocol).
4.4. LIBRARY PREPARATION
• Perform library preparation for the sequencing.
◦ Follow manufacturer’s protocol for library preparation.
◦ Ensure proper indexing/barcoding of samples to prevent
cross-contamination.
4.5. SEQUENCING
• Load samples onto the sequencing platform.
◦ Verify proper calibration and maintenance of the sequencer
according to manufacturer guidelines.
◦ Start the sequencing run and monitor the progress.
◦ Ensure control samples give expected results.
4.6. DATA ANALYSIS
• After the sequencing run is complete, transfer the data to the
bioinformatics platform.
◦ Use appropriate software to align the sequences to the
reference genome.
◦ Identify variants following standard protocols.
◦ Annotate variants using the latest database and bioinformatics
resources.
◦ Perform quality control checks on the data to ensure high
confidence in the results.
4.7. REPORTING RESULTS
• Review the identified variants and their clinical significance.
◦ Compare identified variants against a database of known
pathogenic and likely pathogenic mutations.
◦ Curate the report based on the clinical relevance of the
results.
• Generate a report template containing:
◦ Patient identification
◦ Sample information
◦ List of detected variants with their clinical annotations
◦ Interpretation and comments
• Provide the report to the laboratory supervisor for final review and
authorization.
4.8. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include positive, negative, and internal controls in every batch of
tests.
• Ensure all controls show expected results.
• Document and address any deviations or discrepancies in control
results.
• Review and log equipment calibration and maintenance records.
4.9. TROUBLESHOOTING
• In case of unexpected results or instrument errors:
◦ Review all steps in the process for potential issues.
◦ Re-run controls to confirm results.
◦ Consult with the laboratory supervisor or relevant personnel
for further investigation.
◦ Document all troubleshooting steps and outcomes.
5. DOCUMENTATION
• Maintain thorough documentation of all steps in the analytical
process.
◦ Include details of sample preparation, library preparation,
sequencing runs, data analysis, and final reports.
• Record any deviations, corrective actions, and troubleshooting
efforts.
6. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's instructions for all equipment and reagents used.
• Relevant clinical guidelines for the interpretation of carrier screen,
focused panels, and variant analysis.
• Internal laboratory quality control policies.
Ensure to follow this SOP to maintain the integrity and accuracy of
the Carrier Screen, Focused Panel, and Varies analyses. Deviations
from this SOP must be documented and justified.
