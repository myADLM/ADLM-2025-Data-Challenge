Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Analytical Phase for
Generating Results for Carrot IgE, Serum
1. PURPOSE
To provide standardized procedures for the analytical phase of
generating and reporting results for Carrot IgE (Serum) testing in the
laboratory.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory staff are responsible for
following the procedures outlined in this document for testing and
reporting Carrot IgE levels in serum specimens.
1. DEFINITION
Carrot IgE: Immunoglobulin E specific to a carrot allergen, present in
serum. Serum: The liquid part of blood collected without
anticoagulants, used for testing specific biomarkers, including Carrot
IgE.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENT AND STABILITY
• Specimen Type: Serum collected via venipuncture. • Preferred
Specimen: 3–5 mL serum in a gold or red-top tube (SST or plain
tube). • Stability: - At room temperature (20–25°C): stable for up to 2
hours. - Refrigerated (2–8°C): stable for up to 72 hours. - Frozen
(-20°C or lower): stable for up to 6 months. • Unacceptable
Specimens: Specimens showing signs of hemolysis, lipemia, or
samples collected in anticoagulant tubes (e.g., EDTA or heparin) are
unacceptable.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Analyzers: Specific IgE immunoassay analyzers (e.g., Phadia
ImmunoCAP system). • Reagents: Carrot IgE test reagents,
calibrators, and controls. • Supplies: Pipettes, centrifuges, test tubes,
and waste disposal containers.
1. PROCEDURE
Preparation: • Verify specimen suitability and ensure that it has been
processed correctly. Allow frozen specimens to thaw completely and
bring to room temperature before analysis.
Analyzing:
1. Load the IgE immunoassay analyzer with appropriate test
reagents, ensuring reagents are within their expiry dates.
2. Perform equipment calibration using manufacturer-provided
calibrators.
3. Vortex the serum sample gently to ensure homogeneity.
4. Prepare the sample according to the analyzer’s specifications,
typically involving dilution and reagent addition.
5. Place the sample in the analyzer and initiate the test.
Quality Control: • Run quality control material at the start of each shift
and with each reagent lot change or after major analyzer
maintenance. • Utilize two levels of internal control material (positive
and negative) to ensure assay performance. • Record the control
results and take corrective actions if results fall outside the
acceptable range.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
Result Validation: • Validate generated results per laboratory
standards. • Review the analyzer output for any errors or flags that
may indicate issues to be addressed. • Critical Results: Confirm and
prioritize reporting of critical value results. Immediate notification of
healthcare providers is necessary if values indicate a critical patient
situation according to laboratory protocols.
Documentation: • Record the results in the Laboratory Information
System (LIS). • Verify and release results to the LIS according to
laboratory SOPs. • Lab personnel must confirm all reported results
after review by a technologist.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Carrot IgE levels may vary by age and clinical significance. Typical
reference intervals should be established based on assay
manufacturer guidelines and validated in the laboratory.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to manufacturer’s insert for specific limitations related to
reagent and analyzer performance. Note potential interference by
hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.

1. QUALITY ASSURANCE AND TROUBLESHOOTING
Ensure calibration integrity by adherence to manufacturer
specifications. Follow equipment troubleshooting procedures if
instrument errors occur, and escalate unresolved issues to
supervisory personnel.
Ensure that sample integrity is maintained throughout processing. In
case of questionable sample quality or results, reanalyze samples on
an alternative analyzer if available.
Compliance with laboratory safety protocols and proper waste
disposal are essential throughout the procedure.
