Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for CARROT IGG
1. PURPOSE
To establish a standardized procedure for the analytical phase of
generating results for CARROT IGG testing in a CLIA-certified
laboratory.
Responsibility:
• Laboratory technologists are responsible for performing CARROT
IGG testing according to this SOP.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring adherence to this SOP
and managing any encountered issues.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred specimen:
• Serum: 5 mL of blood collected in a serum separator tube (SST).
Centrifuge the sample within 2 hours of collection to separate the
serum and store at 2-8°C until analysis.
Unacceptable specimens:
• Hemolyzed or lipemic specimens.
• Specimens collected in anticoagulant tubes (e.g., EDTA, heparin).
• Specimens received without a proper label or corresponding
requisition form.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS & SUPPLIES
• CARROT IGG test kits (specific manufacturer instructions are
included with each kit).
• Microplate reader capable of reading at the recommended
wavelength.
• Calibrated pipettes and tips.
• Distilled or deionized water.
• Plate washer (manual or automated).
• Timer.
1. PROCEDURE
A) Preparing the Reagents and Controls:
• Equilibrate all reagents to room temperature before use.
• Prepare all reagents, controls, and standards as indicated in the
manufacturer's instructions provided with the test kit.
• Mix controls and samples gently by inversion, avoiding bubbles.
B) Sample Preparation:
• Bring all serum samples to room temperature before analysis.
• Label microplate wells clearly and according to the plate layout
provided in the kit insert.
C) Running the CARROT IGG Test:
• Pipette the appropriate volume of calibrators, controls, and patient
samples into the designated wells following the plate layout.
• Add the conjugate or reagent as instructed by the manufacturer's
kit insert.
• Incubate the plate for the specified time and temperature as
mentioned in the kit procedure.
• Wash the plate according to the manufacturer's washing
instructions, ensuring thorough removal of wash buffer after each
wash step to minimize background noise.
• Add the substrate solution and incubate for the time specified in
the kit.
E) Measuring and Interpreting Results:
• Measure the absorbance of each well using the microplate reader
at the wavelength specified in the kit instructions.
• Utilize the software provided with the microplate reader to
generate a standard curve and interpolate the concentrations of
CARROT IGG in the test samples.
• Verify that the quality control values fall within the acceptable
range before proceeding to result verification.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run internal QC samples (positive and negative controls) with
each batch of patient samples.
• Document internal QC results and take corrective actions if QC
fails (e.g., recalibrate equipment, repeat the test).
• External QC should be performed periodically as per the
laboratory's QC policy.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Screen the results for any inconsistencies or discrepancies.
• Results are reviewed and verified by the laboratory technologist
before being reported.
• Enter the verified results into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
• Notify the ordering physician if the results require urgent attention.
1. LIMITATIONS
• Follow kit-specific limitations as provided by the manufacturer.
• Hemolyzed or lipemic samples may interfere with test results.
• Please follow the manufacturer’s insert for specific assay
limitations.

• Manufacturer’s instructions for the specific CARROT IGG test kit
used.

manual.
This SOP will be reviewed annually or as needed to ensure
compliance with the best practices and new regulations.
