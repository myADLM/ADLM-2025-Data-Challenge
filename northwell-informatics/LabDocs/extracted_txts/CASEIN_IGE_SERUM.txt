Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analysis of Casein
IgE in Serum
1. PURPOSE
To provide detailed instructions for the analysis of Casein-specific IgE
(Immunoglobulin E) in serum samples using automated
immunoassay technology, ensuring accurate and precise results.
1. SCOPE
This protocol applies to all staff members trained to perform, validate,
and report Casein IgE results in the laboratory.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
• All designated staff members are responsible for performing the
analysis, maintaining the equipment, and documenting all
activities related to the test.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring that the procedures are
followed and that all quality control measures are upheld.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Automated immunoassay analyzer (e.g., ImmunoCAP,
EUROIMMUN Analyzer)
• Casein-specific IgE assay kit
• Calibrators and controls (positive and negative controls)
• Micropipettes and tips
• Centrifuge
• Sample tubes (serum collection)
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Collection and Handling:
• Specimen type: Serum
• Collect blood in a red-top serum separator tube (SST).
• Allow the blood to clot at room temperature for 30 minutes.
• Centrifuge the sample at 1500 x g for 10 minutes to obtain serum.
• Transfer serum to properly labeled tubes.
• Store serum samples at 2-8°C if analysis is to be performed within
48 hours. For longer storage, freeze at -20°C.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation and Calibration:
i. Check that the instrument is calibrated correctly using the provided
calibrators. ii. Ensure that all reagents and controls are brought to
room temperature prior to use. iii. Load the reagents, calibrators,
controls, and patient samples into the analyzer according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
B. Running the Assay:
i. Program the analyzer with the appropriate assay parameters for
Casein IgE as per the manufacturer's instructions. ii. Load the patient
samples (serum) onto the analyzer. iii. Start the run and monitor the
analyzer for any alerts or error messages. iv. Document the initiation
time, and ensure all quality controls (QC) within the run meet the
acceptable range before proceeding with patient sample analysis.
C. Interpret Results:
i. The analyzer will generate Casein IgE concentration results,
expressed in kUA/L. ii. Ensure all QC results fall within the
acceptable ranges. If controls are out of range, troubleshoot
according to the manufacturer's guidelines and repeat the assay if
necessary. iii. Review patient results for any flags or inconsistencies.
Any flagged results should be reanalyzed or verified by a supervisor.
1. QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE
• Run external controls (positive and negative) with each batch of
patient samples.
• Ensure that QC results are documented and reviewed for each
assay run.
• Verify that internal QC is performed daily, and any deviations are
addressed immediately.
• Participate in external proficiency testing periodically, as
scheduled.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Verify results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Abnormal or high-concentration results that indicate potential
allergies must be reviewed by a pathologist or designated
supervisor before final release.
• Ensure that results are reported to clinicians in accordance with
laboratory guidelines and within the established turnaround time.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Negative: < 0.1 kUA/L
• Low: 0.1 – 0.34 kUA/L
• Moderate: 0.35 – 0.69 kUA/L
• High: ≥ 0.7 kUA/L
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolysis, lipemia, and inappropriate sample storage can affect
test results.
• Cross-reactivity with other proteins may occasionally occur.
• Always consider clinical correlation with patient history and other
laboratory findings.
