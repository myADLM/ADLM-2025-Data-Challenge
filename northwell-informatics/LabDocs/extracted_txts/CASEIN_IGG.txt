CASEIN IGG ANTIBODY TESTING PROTOCOL
1. PURPOSE
This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) describes the procedure
for the analytical phase of the CASEIN IgG Antibody test in the
laboratory. This test is used to measure specific IgG antibodies
against casein in patient specimens.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all staff members responsible for performing
CASEIN IgG Antibody testing in the laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory staff to perform the
CASEIN IgG Antibody test following this SOP and to ensure all
results are accurate, reliable, and promptly communicated to the
ordering healthcare provider.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/Acceptable Specimens:
• 5-10 mL serum collected in a standard serum separator tube
(SST)
• Serum should be separated from cells within 2 hours of collection.
• Store serum at 2-8°C if testing will be performed within 48 hours.
For longer storage, freeze at -20°C or lower.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
• Samples stored at room temperature for more than 8 hours.
• Samples without proper labeling (patient identification, collection
date/time).
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) kit for CASEIN
IgG Antibody
• Microplate reader capable of measuring absorbance at 450 nm
• Pipettes and sterile pipette tips
• Dilution tubes
• Wash buffer
• TMB substrate solution
• Stop solution
6. QUALITY CONTROL
Materials:
• Positive and negative control sera as provided in the ELISA kit or
prepared according to lab standards
• Internal controls specific to CASEIN IgG testing
Storage:
• Store all controls and reagents according to manufacturer's
instructions, usually at 2-8°C.
• Do not use any reagents or controls past their expiration date.
Procedure:
• Run controls with each batch of specimens.
• Document all control results. If controls do not meet acceptance
criteria, the run is invalid.
7. PROCEDURE
A. Initial Setup:
1. Bring all reagents and samples to room temperature before
use.
2. Label all dilution tubes and test wells.
B. Sample Preparation:
1. Dilute patient samples as specified by the ELISA kit
manufacturer (usually 1:100).
2. Prepare positive and negative controls according to kit
instructions.
C. ELISA Testing:
1. Add diluted patient specimens and controls to the designated
wells.
2. Add the provided enzyme conjugate to each well. Incubate at
room temperature for the specified time (typically 30 minutes).
3. Wash the plate using wash buffer, following the kit’s specific
washing procedure.
4. Add TMB substrate to each well. Incubate in the dark at room
temperature for the specified time (typically 10-20 minutes).
5. Add stop solution to each well to halt the reaction. Mix by gentle
tapping of the plate.
D. Reading Results:
1. Read the absorbance at 450 nm using a microplate reader
within 30 minutes of stopping the reaction.
2. Use the ELISA kit’s provided standards to construct a standard
curve and calculate antibody concentrations in U/mL or
appropriate units.
8. RESULT INTERPRETATION
• Compare patient absorbance values to the standard curve to
determine CASEIN IgG concentration.
• Report results according to the laboratory's reporting protocol and
include reference ranges (typically provided by the ELISA kit
manufacturer).
9. REPORTING RESULTS
• Refer to site-specific reporting guidelines to report results.
• Ensure all results are reviewed and verified by a qualified
technologist prior to release.
• Critical results should be flagged and communicated promptly to
the ordering physician.
10. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to the ELISA kit insert for detailed limitations.
• False-positive or false-negative results can occur due to improper
sample handling or procedural errors.
