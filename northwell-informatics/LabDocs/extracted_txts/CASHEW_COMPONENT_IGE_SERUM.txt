Protocol for Analytical Phase: CASHEW COMPONENT, IGE,
SERUM
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the analytical phase of
generating results for CASHEW COMPONENT, IgE in serum
specimens.
2. SCOPE
This protocol applies to all laboratory personnel responsible for
performing the CASHEW COMPONENT, IgE assay in a CLIA-
certified laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
All designated laboratory staff performing the CASHEW
COMPONENT, IgE assay are responsible for adhering to this
procedure to ensure consistent and accurate results.
Laboratory supervisors are responsible for ensuring compliance
with this protocol.
4. DEFINITIONS
• CASHEW COMPONENT, IgE: A specific IgE test measuring the
presence of immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies directed against
cashew nut proteins in the serum.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Acceptable Specimen: Serum collected in SST (serum separator
tube).
• Collection Volume: 1-2 mL of serum.
• Stability: Specimens may be stored at 2-8°C for up to 7 days. If
analysis is delayed beyond this period, serum should be aliquoted
and stored at -20°C or lower.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Immunoassay analyzer: e.g., Phadia 250 or similar
• Calibration and Control materials specific for IgE testing
• Cashew component IgE reagents and standards
• PPE and Standard laboratory supplies
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation
2. Ensure that the immunoassay analyzer has been properly
calibrated according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
3. Prepare controls and standards according to the manufacturer’s
guidelines.
B. Specimen Handling
1. Thaw frozen specimens at room temperature, if applicable.
2. Mix the serum samples thoroughly by gentle inversion.
Centrifuge if particulate matter is observed.
C. Assay Procedure
1. Load specimens, controls, and standards onto the
immunoassay analyzer according to the instrument’s loading
instructions.
2. Program the analyzer with the appropriate assay method for
CASHEW COMPONENT, IgE, ensuring all parameters are
correctly set.
3. Initiate the assay run.
D. Post-Run Procedure
1. Review Quality Control (QC) results. Accept or reject the run
based on QC acceptance criteria.
2. If QC results are within acceptable limits, proceed to review
patient specimen results.
3. If QC results fall outside acceptable limits, troubleshoot and
repeat the QC run before processing patient specimens.
4. REPORTING RESULTS
5. Verify that all QC and calibration criteria have been met.
6. Review the generated results for each specimen. Evaluate any
flags, errors, or anomalies.
7. Enter verified results into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
8. Report results according to laboratory’s standard reporting
guidelines. Ensure any critical results are communicated to the
ordering physician immediately.
9. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Results are reported in kU/L.
• Reference ranges and interpretation guidelines should be based
on validated literature and manufacturer’s recommendations.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform quality control checks per laboratory guidelines using
multi-level controls.
• Document all QC results and any corrective actions taken.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If an assay run fails QC, investigate potential reasons, including
reagent integrity, instrument function, and operator procedure.
• Repeat the run after corrective actions have been taken and
validated.
1. REFERENCE MATERIAL
This protocol references manufacturer guidelines and peer-
reviewed standards for IgE immunoassays. Further details can
be found in the instrument’s user manual and assay kit
instructions.
2. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS
• Follow all standard laboratory safety procedures.
• Use appropriate PPE (personal protective equipment) including
gloves and lab coat.
• Handle and dispose of biological materials and sharps according
to biohazard regulations.
