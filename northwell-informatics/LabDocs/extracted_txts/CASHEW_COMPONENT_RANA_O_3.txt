PROTOCOL FOR THE ANALYTICAL PHASE OF
GENERATING RESULTS FOR CASHEW COMPONENT
RANA O 3
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to outline the steps for the
analytical phase of testing for the Cashew Component Rana O
3, ensuring reliable and accurate results. Compliance with this
procedure aids in maintaining the quality and consistency of
laboratory results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
This protocol is to be followed by trained laboratory staff
responsible for carrying out the analytical phase of the cashew
component Rana O 3 testing.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
◦ Preferred/Acceptable Specimen: Serum or plasma
collected in an EDTA or SST tube.
◦ Unacceptable Specimen: Hemolyzed or lipemic samples,
or those received in non-recommended collection tubes.
4. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
◦ Immunoassay Analyzer
◦ Calibrated Micropipettes
◦ Disposable Micropipette Tips
◦ Timer
◦ Reagent Kits specific for the Cashew Component Rana O 3
◦ Quality Control (QC) Materials
◦ Specimen Tubes
5. REAGENTS
◦ Cashew Component Rana O 3 reagent kit, including:
▪ Coated Microtiter Plates
▪ Standards and Controls
▪ Enzyme-Conjugate
▪ Substrate Solution
▪ Stop Solution
◦ Storage conditions: Store all reagents as per the
manufacturer's instructions, usually at 2-8°C. Avoid freezing.
6. CALIBRATION AND QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Calibration: Perform calibration on the immunoassay
analyzer using the standards provided in the reagent kit.
Calibration should be performed according to the
manufacturer's guidelines and validated with each new lot of
reagents or when reagent integrity is in doubt.
◦ Quality Control: Run positive and negative quality control
samples at the beginning of each analytical batch. QC
results must fall within the specified range provided by the
supplier. Document all QC results in the QC log.
7. ANALYTICAL PROCEDURE
7.1 Preparation
◦ Allow all reagents, specimens, and standards to come to
room temperature (22-26°C) before use.
◦ Ensure that all equipment is calibrated and functioning
correctly.
7.2 Specimen Handling
◦ Centrifuge the specimens at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes to
separate serum/plasma from cells.
◦ Inspect the separated serum/plasma for any signs of
hemolysis or lipemia. Reject such specimens and request a
new sample if necessary.
7.3 Assay Procedure
◦ Add the recommended volume of serum/plasma (typically
50-100 µL) to the wells of the coated microtiter plate.
◦ Add the enzyme-conjugate reagent to each well.
◦ Seal the plate with adhesive foil and incubate for the
specified time at the designated temperature (typically 1
hour at 37°C).
◦ Wash the plate thoroughly with the washing solution
provided to remove unbound material.
◦ Add the substrate solution to each well and incubate further
as instructed (usually 15-30 minutes at room temperature).
◦ Add the stop solution to terminate the reaction.
7.4 Reading Results
◦ Read the absorbance of each well at the specified
wavelength using an immunoassay analyzer or microplate
reader.
◦ Generate a standard curve using the absorbance values of
the standards. Calculate the concentration of Cashew
Component Rana O 3 in the unknown samples based on
this curve.
8. DATA HANDLING AND REPORTING
◦ Verify that all QC results are within acceptable limits before
releasing patient results.
◦ Enter the patient results into the Laboratory Information
System (LIS) and review for accuracy.
◦ Flag and document any critical values as per the
laboratory’s critical result policy. Communicate critical
results to the responsible healthcare provider immediately.
9. TROUBLESHOOTING
◦ If the QC results fall outside the acceptable range, do not
proceed with the patient samples until the issue is resolved.
◦ Common issues include reagent degradation, equipment
malfunction, and procedural errors. Refer to the reagent kit
insert for troubleshooting tips specific to the assay.
