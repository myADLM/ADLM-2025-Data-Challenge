Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for CASHEW, IGE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
To establish a standard procedure for the analytical phase of
generating accurate and reproducible results for CASHEW, IgE,
SERUM assay in accordance with the Clinical Laboratory
Improvement Amendments (CLIA) and laboratory regulations.
Responsibility: It is the responsibility of all designated laboratory
personnel to perform procedures as outlined, ensuring accuracy and
consistency of test results. All personnel must also ensure that
instrument maintenance and quality control measures are adhered to
in order to uphold test integrity.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type:
• Serum
Specimen Collection:
• Collect blood specimen using appropriate aseptic techniques.
• After collection, the blood should be allowed to clot by leaving it
undisturbed at room temperature for 30–60 minutes.
• Centrifuge the specimen at 1500–2000g for 10 minutes to
separate serum from the clot cells.
Specimen Handling and Storage:
• Label the serum specimen tube with the patient’s name, date, and
time of collection.
• Serum can be stored at 2–8°C for up to 48 hours. For long-term
storage, freeze at -20°C or colder.
• Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles to maintain specimen integrity.
1. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
a. Immunoassay analyzer b. Calibrators and Controls specific to IgE
measurement c. CASHEW allergen-specific IgE test kits d.
Microcentrifuge (for specimen preparation) e. 1.5 mL microcentrifuge
tubes f. Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) g. Reagent grade
water (if needed for reagent reconstitution) h. Calibrated pipettes and
tips
1. REAGENTS
• Allergen-specific IgE test kit for CASHEW
• Quality controls (high and low levels specific to IgE)
• Calibration material
Storage and Handling:
• Store all reagents as specified by the manufacturer.
• Allow reagents to reach room temperature before use.
• Do not use expired reagents.
1. PROCEDURE
2. Calibration:
◦ Perform calibration using the specific calibrators provided by
the test kit manufacturer according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
◦ Verify calibration curve before running patient samples.
3. Quality Control:
◦ Run quality control samples at both high and low levels
once per day before patient testing and after every batch of
patient samples.
◦ Ensure that QC results fall within the manufacturer’s
recommended range.
◦ Document QC results in the laboratory log, investigate any
out-of-range QC results, and take appropriate corrective
action.
4. Testing Procedure:
◦ Thaw frozen specimens at room temperature.
◦ Pipette the required volume of serum into the reaction well
as specified by the test kit protocol.
◦ Add reagents and incubate for the recommended time at the
specified temperature.
◦ Wash the wells to remove any unbound antibodies (follow
the wash protocol in the test kit instructions).
◦ Add the detection reagent and incubate as prescribed.
◦ Read the results using a compatible immunoassay analyzer.
◦ Document and review results before validation.
5. REPORTING RESULTS
Result Validation:
• Review results to ensure values are within the reportable range.
• Verify that all control and calibration requirements are met.
• Results exceeding the analytical measurement range should be
appropriately flagged, and if necessary, the specimen should be
diluted and retested.
Documentation:
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Document any incident of non-conformance and corrective
actions taken.
1. REPORTING REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Ranges for serum IgE levels can be dependent on the age and
clinical context of the patient:
◦ Reference Interval: [Provide the specific laboratory reference
range, as it can vary]
1. LIMITATIONS
• Hemolysis, lipemia, and icterus in serum samples can interfere
with assay results.
• Patients undergoing immunotherapy or with high total IgE levels
may have altered individual allergen-specific IgE levels.
• Cross-reactivity with other allergens may occur, and
comprehensive patient history and clinical correlation are
recommended.
1. QUALITY CONTROL AND TROUBLESHOOTING
• Record all maintenance and quality control activities.
• Troubleshoot any technical issues as per instrument manuals and
consultation with the senior technologist.
• For persistent errors in results, consult the manufacturer.
