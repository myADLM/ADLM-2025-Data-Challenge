Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Testing:
CASHEW, IGE WITH REFLEX TO CASHEW COMPONENT, IGE,
SERUM
1. PURPOSE
To provide a defined procedure for the analytical phase of testing for
Cashew, IgE with reflex to Cashew Component, IgE, Serum. This
protocol ensures accurate identification and quantification of IgE
antibodies specific to cashew nuts, and reflex testing to its
components if applicable.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of the assigned laboratory technologists to
follow this procedure accurately for generating reliable results.
Supervisors are responsible for monitoring adherence to this SOP
and implementing corrective actions when necessary.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred Specimen:
◦ 3 mL serum collected in a plain red-top tube or serum
separation tube (SST).
• Unacceptable Specimen:
◦ Plasma, hemolyzed serum specimens, lipemic samples, or
samples received in non-serum tubes.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• ELISA (Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay) or ImmunoCAP
system for IgE quantification.
• Cashew-specific IgE test kits (refer to manufacturer's guidelines).
• Cashew Component-specific IgE test kits (for reflex testing).
• Centrifuge
• Micropipettes
• Calibration standards and quality control materials as specified by
the test kit manufacturer.
• Appropriate disposable labware (e.g., tips, tubes).
• Laboratory Information System (LIS) for result documentation.
4. PROCEDURE
A. Setup and Calibration:
1. Warm Up:
◦ Turn on the ELISA/ImmunoCAP instrument and allow it to
warm up as per the manufacturer's instructions.
2. Calibration:
◦ Perform instrument calibration using standard controls
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Document
calibration data.
3. Quality Control:
◦ Run quality control materials (positive and negative controls)
provided by the test kit manufacturer to validate the test
runs. Document the QC results and ensure they are within
the acceptable range before proceeding.
B. Sample Preparation:
1. Serum Processing:
◦ Centrifuge the serum samples at 2000-3000 rpm for 10
minutes.
◦ Carefully aliquot the clear, non-hemolyzed serum avoiding
any cellular components.
2. Sample Identification:
◦ Label the aliquots with patient identifiers and log in the LIS.
C. Analytical Testing:
1. IgE, Total (Initial Test):
◦ Perform the total IgE test using the ELISA/ImmunoCAP
system, following the manufacturer’s protocol.
◦ Enter results into the LIS. Results above the lab-defined
threshold for Cashew IgE should trigger reflex testing for
Cashew Component IgE.
2. Cashew IgE Detection:
◦ In response to total IgE results, use Cashew-specific IgE
test kits.
◦ Incubate the serum with cashew nut-specific allergens
coated on the assay well.
◦ Wash and add enzyme conjugate.
◦ Incubate and wash according to kit instructions.
◦ Add substrate and stop solutions.
◦ Read absorbance or fluorescence values as directed by the
system.
D. Reflex Testing for Cashew Components:
1. Trigger Condition:
◦ If the cashew-specific IgE level meets or exceeds the
threshold, reflex testing for individual cashew components
(Ana o 1, Ana o 2, etc.) is performed.
2. Component-Specific Testing:
◦ Follow specific kit instructions for each cashew component
IgE test.
◦ Perform necessary antibody binding, incubation, washing,
and detection steps.
E. Data Analysis and Reporting:
1. Result Interpretation:
◦ Compare the obtained values with reference ranges
provided by the test manufacturer.
◦ For component-specific IgE, provide interpretation based on
relative concentrations and clinical significance as specified.
2. Documentation and Review:
◦ Validate the results in the LIS. Ensure all tests and controls
are properly logged and verified.
◦ Review results for consistency and accuracy before
reporting.
3. Reporting:
◦ Report the results following the defined reporting guidelines.
◦ Use predefined comment codes for any atypical results or
interference findings (i.e., 'No result due to interference').
5. QUALITY CONTROL AND MAINTENANCE
1. QC Protocol:
◦ Perform and document QC for each batch of tests using
commercial controls.
◦ Investigate and document any QC failures before releasing
results.
2. Instrument Maintenance:
◦ Conduct routine maintenance as per the manufacturer’s
schedule.
◦ Document all maintenance activities in the logbook.

7. DOCUMENTATION
Document all procedural steps, calibrations, quality controls,
maintenance, and corrective actions in accordance with laboratory
policies.
This procedure ensures the accuracy and reliability of Cashew, IgE
with reflex to Cashew Component IgE testing, meeting clinical
standards and regulatory requirements. All laboratory technologists
should review and be proficient with this SOP before undertaking
these assays.
