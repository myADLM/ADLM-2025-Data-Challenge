Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase of Generating Results for Cashew IgG
(CASHEW IGG)
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to define the analytical procedure for
generating results for Cashew IgG (CASHEW IGG) in a CLIA-
certified laboratory. This includes the steps taken to ensure the
accuracy and reliability of the test results.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all designated laboratory personnel responsible
for performing Cashew IgG testing.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Laboratory Technologists: Responsible for conducting the
analytical phase as per the following procedures.
• Supervisors: Responsible for overseeing the process and
ensuring compliance with this SOP.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) reader
• ELISA microplate
• Pipettes and tips (calibrated)
• Microplate washer
• Incubator
• Cashew IgG ELISA kit
• Calibrators and controls
• Deionized water
• Laboratory timer
5. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation
1. Specimen: Verify if the specimen has been properly collected,
received, and accessioned.
◦ Acceptable specimens: Serum collected in a red-top or
serum-separating tube.
◦ Unacceptable specimens: Hemolyzed, lipemic, and icteric
samples.
2. Reagents:
◦ Follow the manufacturer's instructions for reconstituting and
preparing reagents from the Cashew IgG ELISA kit.
◦ Bring all reagents and samples to room temperature before
use.
B) Assay Procedure
1. Microplate Preparation:
◦ Set up the ELISA microplate according to the manufacturer's
instructions, placing calibrators, controls, and patient
samples in the appropriate wells.
◦ Pipette 100 μL of each calibrator, control, and sample into
their designated wells.
◦ Pipette 100 μL of zero standard (negative control) into two
separate wells for a duplicate reading.
2. Antibody Incubation:
◦ Add 100 μL of enzyme-conjugate anti-human IgG to each
well.
◦ Incubate the microplate for 30 minutes at room temperature.
3. Washing:
◦ Wash the plate 3-5 times with the recommended wash
buffer using a microplate washer to remove the unbound
substances.
◦ Ensure all wells are emptied completely after each wash.
4. Substrate Addition:
◦ Add 100 μL of the substrate solution to each well.
◦ Incubate the plate for 15 minutes at room temperature in the
dark (this incubation period can vary; refer to specific kit
instruction).
5. Stopping the Reaction:
◦ Add 100 μL of the stop solution to each well.
◦ Tap the plate gently to ensure thorough mixing.
C) Reading and Analyzing Results
1. Microplate Reading:
◦ Read the absorbance of each well at 450 nm using the
ELISA reader.
◦ Ensure that the ELISA reader is calibrated and set to the
blank well (zero standard).
2. Calculations:
◦ Calculate the mean absorbance for each set of duplicate
controls, calibrators, and samples.
◦ Plot the mean absorbance of the calibrators against their
corresponding concentrations to generate the standard
curve.
◦ Determine the concentration of IgG specific to Cashew in
the test samples using the standard curve.
3. Quality Control:
◦ Ensure that the values of the calibrators and controls fall
within the expected range specified by the kit’s
manufacturer.
◦ Run high, medium, and low positive controls, as well as
negative controls, with each assay.
D) Documentation
1. Record-Keeping:
◦ Document the lot numbers and expiration dates of all kits
and reagents used.
◦ Log the sample ID, timestamp of processing, and initials of
the technologist.
◦ Note any deviations from the SOP and corrective steps
taken.
2. Reporting:
◦ All IgG specific to Cashew results must be reviewed and
verified by a qualified supervisor.
◦ Results that fall outside the expected quality control ranges
should be reevaluated before final reporting.
◦ Critical values should be handled as per laboratory critical
value SOPs.
6. REFERENCE VALUES
• IgG specific to Cashew: Refer to kit-specific reference intervals for
positive, negative, and borderline interpretations.
7. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Factors such as interfering substances (e.g., rheumatoid factor),
lipemic or hemolyzed samples, and improper sample handling
could affect the accuracy of the results.
