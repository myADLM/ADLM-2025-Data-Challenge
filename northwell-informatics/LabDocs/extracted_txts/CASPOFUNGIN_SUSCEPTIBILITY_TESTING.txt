CASPOFUNGIN SUSCEPTIBILITY TESTING PROTOCOL
1. PURPOSE
This procedure outlines the standard operating protocol for testing
the susceptibility of fungal isolates to Caspofungin, using appropriate
laboratory techniques to ensure accurate and reliable results. This
protocol contributes to determining the efficacy of Caspofungin
against fungal pathogens, supporting clinical decisions and patient
care.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred medium:
• Clinical isolates derived from sterile or non-sterile body sites.
Yeast isolates should be pure, viable, and adequately identified.
Storage and Handling:
• Store the isolates at 2-8°C with proper labelling until test setup.
• Ensure viability and purity before proceeding with susceptibility
testing.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Mixed cultures or contaminated samples.
• Dead/non-viable isolates.
• Specimens showing significant deviation from storage
requirements.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND MATERIALS
• Incubator capable of maintaining 35-37°C.
• Caspofungin powder (standardized potency).
• RPMI-1640 medium buffered with MOPS.
• Sterile saline solution (0.85% NaCl).
• Microtiter plates (96 wells).
• Sterile pipette tips.
• Multichannel pipette.
• Sterile loops and inoculating devices.
• Vortex mixer.
• Plate reader capable of measuring OD at 450 nm.
• Quality control strains (e.g., Candida parapsilosis ATCC 22019,
Candida krusei ATCC 6258).
4. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation of Inoculum:
1. Perform an overnight culture of the fungal isolate on
appropriate solid medium (e.g., Sabouraud Dextrose Agar).
2. Prepare a suspension in sterile saline to match the turbidity of a
0.5 McFarland standard (approximately 1-5 x 10^6 CFU/mL).
3. Dilute the suspension in RPMI-1640 medium to achieve a final
concentration of approximately 1-5 x 10^3 CFU/mL for
inoculation.
B. Preparation of Caspofungin:
1. Prepare stock solutions of Caspofungin in RPMI-1640 medium
as per supplier recommendations.
2. Perform serial dilutions in RPMI-1640 medium across the
microtiter plate to cover a range of concentrations (e.g., 0.0156
to 16 μg/mL).
C. Inoculation and Incubation:
1. Dispense 100 µL of diluted Caspofungin solution into each well
of the microtiter plate.
2. Add 100 µL of the prepared inoculum to each well, giving a final
volume of 200 µL per well.
3. Include control wells with RPMI-1640 medium (no drug) and
wells with RPMI medium but without microorganism (blank
control) for baseline readings.
4. Incubate the plate at 35-37°C for 24 hours to 48 hours without
agitation.
D. Reading and Interpretation:
1. Measure the optical density (OD) of each well at 450 nm using
a plate reader.
2. Determine the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) as the
lowest concentration of Caspofungin that visually inhibits
growth (OD near blank control).
3. Record the MIC values in the laboratory information system
(LIS).
4. Verify the results against established MIC interpretive criteria
for Caspofungin.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Include known quality control strains with each batch of tests to
verify expected MIC values.
2. Perform regular maintenance and calibration of equipment
(incubator, plate reader).
3. Document all quality control measures, corrective actions, and
performance checks as per standard laboratory practice.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Accurately enter results into the LIS, including the MIC value
and any interpretative commentary based on established
susceptibility criteria.
2. Review and approve results by the technologist before final
release.
3. Report any out-of-range results or unexpected findings
immediately to the supervisor and clinician.
7. REFERENCE INTERVALS AND INTERPRETIVE CRITERIA
Refer to the latest guidelines provided by authoritative bodies (e.g.,
CLSI M27 standard) for the specific interpretive criteria for
Caspofungin susceptibility.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the product insert and relevant literature for limitations and
potential interferences affecting susceptibility results. Ensure that the
methodology follows standardized protocols to minimize variability
and inaccuracies.
