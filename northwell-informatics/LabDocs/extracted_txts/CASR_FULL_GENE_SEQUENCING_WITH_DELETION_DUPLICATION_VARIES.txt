Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
CASR Full Gene Sequencing with Deletion/Duplication Testing
1. PURPOSE
◦ To provide standardized procedures for the analytical phase
of CASR (calcium-sensing receptor) full gene sequencing
with deletion/duplication testing in a CLIA-certified
laboratory. This ensures accurate, reproducible, and timely
results.
2. SCOPE
◦ This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel performing
CASR gene sequencing and deletion/duplication analysis.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
◦ Personnel: All trained laboratory technicians and clinical
laboratory scientists performing these assays.
◦ Supervisors: Ensure compliance with SOP, validate new
procedures, and provide training.
◦ Quality Assurance (QA) Managers: Review data quality and
adherence to SOPs.
4. DEFINITIONS
◦ CASR: Calcium-Sensing Receptor gene.
◦ PCR: Polymerase Chain Reaction.
◦ MLPA: Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification.
◦ NGS: Next-Generation Sequencing.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND MATERIALS
◦ Thermocycler
◦ NGS platform (e.g., Illumina, Ion Torrent)
◦ MLPA kit specific for CASR gene
◦ Sequencing primers for CASR gene
◦ PCR reagents
◦ DNA extraction kit
◦ Positive and negative controls
◦ Analytical software for sequence alignment and variant
calling
6. PROCEDURE
A. DNA Extraction:
◦ Extract genomic DNA from received specimens following the
laboratory's DNA extraction SOP.
◦ Measure DNA concentration using a spectrophotometer or
fluorometer.
◦ Ensure DNA quality by running 1 μL on an agarose gel.
B. PCR Amplification:
◦ Amplify the coding regions and flanking intronic regions of
the CASR gene using specific primers.
▪ Follow the standardized PCR conditions:
▪ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 2 minutes
▪ 35 cycles of:
▪ Denaturation: 95°C for 30 seconds
▪ Annealing: 55-60°C (primer-specific) for 30
seconds
▪ Extension: 72°C for 1 minute
▪ Final extension: 72°C for 5 minutes
◦ Verify PCR product size using agarose gel electrophoresis.
C. Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS):
◦ Prepare NGS libraries following manufacturer’s protocol.
◦ Perform quality control (QC) on libraries via bioanalyzer or
similar equipment.
◦ Sequence libraries on an NGS platform with specified read
lengths and coverage depth (e.g., Illumina MiSeq, 150 bp
paired-end reads, 30x coverage).
D. Data Analysis:
◦ Align NGS reads to the reference genome (GRCh37/hg19
or GRCh38).
◦ Use variant calling software to identify single nucleotide
variants (SNVs), insertions, and deletions.
◦ Annotate variants using a variant annotation tool (e.g.,
Annovar, VEP).
E. Deletion/Duplication Analysis:
◦ Conduct MLPA assay using the specific MLPA kit for CASR.
◦ Analyze the MLPA data according to the manufacturer’s
instructions and compare it to control samples.
F. Result Interpretation and Reporting:
◦ Review sequence data and identified variants by a certified
molecular geneticist.
◦ Classify variants according to ACMG guidelines.
◦ Create a comprehensive report including:
▪ Patient information
▪ Methodology
▪ Detected variants and their interpretations
▪ Recommendations for further testing if necessary
◦ Report variant findings and interpretations to the ordering
physician via the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
7. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Include positive and negative control samples for each run
of PCR, NGS, and MLPA.
◦ Adhere to internal and external QC programs to monitor
assay performance.
◦ Document all QC results and actions taken for any QC
failures.
8. REFERENCE INTERVALS
◦ Refer to established databases (e.g., ClinVar, HGMD) for
known variant classifications.
◦ Reference ACMG standards and guidelines for
interpretation and reporting.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ Enter results and review results for accuracy before
verification.
◦ Verify and approve reports by a qualified technologist or
pathologist.
10. REFERENCES
◦ ACMG Standards and Guidelines for the Interpretation of
Sequence Variants.
◦ Manufacturer’s manuals and instructions for NGS and MLPA
kits.
◦ Laboratory-specific protocols for DNA extraction, PCR, and
analytical software user guides.
11. REVISIONS
◦ This SOP will be reviewed annually and revised as needed
to comply with updated methodologies and guidelines.
