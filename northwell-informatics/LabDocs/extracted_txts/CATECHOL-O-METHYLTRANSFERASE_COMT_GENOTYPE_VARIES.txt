Standard Operating Procedure CATECHOL-O-
METHYLTRANSFERASE (COMT) GENOTYPE ANALYSIS
1. PURPOSE: This SOP is designed to outline the procedure for
the genotyping of the Catechol-O-Methyltransferase (COMT)
gene. This protocol will ensure consistency, accuracy, and
reliability of results in the determination of COMT genotypes.
Responsibility: Designated staff are responsible for performing and
documenting the steps outlined in this procedure. It is the
responsibility of the laboratory supervisor to ensure adherence to this
SOP, establish corrective actions if deviations occur, and oversee
quality control and data integrity.
1. SCOPE: This protocol applies to all laboratory personnel
performing DNA extraction, PCR amplification, and subsequent
genotyping for COMT.
2. SPECIMEN: Accepted Specimens:
• Peripheral blood in ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) tubes.
• Buccal swabs collected in DNA stabilization buffer.
• Saliva samples collected using DNA collection kits.
Specimen Handling and Storage:
• Blood specimens should be stored at 4°C if processing within 72
hours. For longer storage, freeze at -20°C or lower.
• Buccal swabs and saliva samples should be stored according to
the manufacturer's guidelines, typically at room temperature for
short-term and -20°C or lower for long-term storage.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES:
• Thermocycler for PCR amplification
• PCR workstations with UV sterilization
• Automated DNA extraction system or manual DNA extraction kits
• Microcentrifuges
• Pipettes and tips (filtered)
• PCR tubes/plates
• COMT-specific primers and probes
• PCR master mix (with Taq polymerase)
• Agarose gel electrophoresis system and ethidium bromide or
alternative DNA staining dye
• Gel documentation system
• DNA ladders and loading buffers
• Nuclease-free water
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
1. PROCEDURE: A) DNA Extraction:
2. Process specimen according to manufacturer's instructions for
DNA extraction kits.
3. Quantify DNA using a spectrophotometer or fluorometer,
ensuring DNA concentration is within the desired range (10-100
ng/µL).
4. Store extracted DNA at -20°C until further use.
B) PCR Amplification:
1. Prepare PCR master mix containing:
◦ 10 µL PCR master mix with buffer, dNTPs, and MgCl2
◦ 1 µL forward primer (10 µM)
◦ 1 µL reverse primer (10 µM)
◦ 1 µL probe (if applicable)
◦ 2 µL DNA template (20-50 ng)
◦ Nuclease-free water to a total volume of 25 µL
2. Aliquot the master mix into PCR tubes or plates.
3. Seal tubes/plates and place them in the thermocycler.
4. Run the following PCR program:
◦ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 5 minutes
◦ Denaturation: 95°C for 30 seconds
◦ Annealing: 60°C for 30 seconds
◦ Extension: 72°C for 1 minute
◦ Final extension: 72°C for 5 minutes
◦ Hold: 4°C (35 cycles are typically sufficient)
C) Gel Electrophoresis:
1. Prepare 2% agarose gel with suitable staining dye.
2. Load PCR products mixed with loading buffer into the wells.
3. Include a DNA ladder for size reference.
4. Run gel electrophoresis at 100V for 30-45 minutes.
5. Visualize DNA bands using a gel documentation system.
D) Genotyping:
1. Compare the PCR product bands to the DNA ladder.
2. Identify the genotypes based on the presence or absence of
specific DNA fragments.
3. If qPCR or sequencing was used, analyze data with appropriate
software to assign genotypes.
4. QUALITY CONTROL:
• Include positive and negative controls in each batch of PCR
reactions to ensure assay integrity.
• Review the performance of controls; any deviation requires
troubleshooting and possible repeat of the entire batch.
• Document all steps, observations, and control results in the
laboratory logbook.
1. REPORTING RESULTS:
• Results are entered into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Interpretations and genotypes are carefully reviewed and verified
before final reporting.
• Any unusual findings or technical issues should be flagged and
discussed with the laboratory supervisor before reporting.
1. REFERENCE RANGES: N/A – Genotyping results are
qualitative and will indicate specific COMT variants (e.g., Val/
Val, Val/Met, Met/Met).
2. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
• Contamination can lead to false positives; use of filtered tips and
dedicated workspaces is critical.
• PCR inhibitors in the sample can lead to false negatives.
• Specificity and accuracy depend on primer and probe design.
