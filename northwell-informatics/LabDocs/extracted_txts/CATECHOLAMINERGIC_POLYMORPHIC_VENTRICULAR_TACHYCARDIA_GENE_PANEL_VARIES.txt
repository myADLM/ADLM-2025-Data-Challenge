**Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
**For the Analysis of Catecholaminergic Polymorphic Ventricular
Tachycardia
Gene Panel Using Next-Generation Sequencing
1. PURPOSE
This document outlines the detailed steps for the analytical phase of
generating results for the Catecholaminergic Polymorphic Ventricular
Tachycardia (CPVT) Gene Panel using Next-Generation Sequencing
(NGS). This procedure ensures that all sequencing and
bioinformatics analyses are performed consistently and accurately to
meet the required standards of quality and validity for clinical
reporting.
Responsibility:
Designated staff involved in sequencing and bioinformatics analysis
are responsible for the execution, monitoring, and documentation of
the procedures as outlined in this SOP. Supervisors are responsible
for ensuring adherence to the SOP, assessing data quality, and
verifying results before release.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel involved in sequencing
and analysis of the CPVT Gene Panel. It includes protocols for
sample preparation, sequencing, data analysis, interpretation, and
documentation.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• A minimum of 3 mL whole blood collected in an EDTA (lavender-
top) tube.
• Specimen must be received within 72 hours of collection if stored
at 2-8°C.
• Alternatively, extracted genomic DNA with a minimum
concentration of 20 ng/μL and a total volume of 50 μL.
4. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• NGS Instrument (e.g., Illumina MiSeq, NextSeq)
• DNA Extraction Kit (as per manufacturer’s instructions)
• Library Preparation Kit
• Indexing Primers
• Reagents for PCR amplification
• Clean room and benchtop workspace
• Thermal Cycler
• Qubit Fluorometer or equivalent concentration measurement
device
• Agilent Bioanalyzer or similar for library sizing
5. PROCEDURE
5.1 DNA Extraction
• Extract DNA from whole blood or other specified specimen using
the designated DNA extraction kit.
• Quantify and assess purity using Qubit and NanoDrop.
• Ensure the DNA integrity by running an aliquot on 1% agarose
gel.
5.2 Library Preparation and Quantification
• Prepare DNA library using a validated library preparation kit
according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
• Amplify target regions by PCR using gene-specific primers.
• Verify the size and quality of the library using an Agilent
Bioanalyzer.
• Quantify libraries using Qubit.
5.3 Sequencing
• Load prepared libraries onto the NGS instrument following the
manufacturer's guidelines.
• Sequences are generated in paired-end 150 bp reads.
• Run appropriate internal controls to ensure sequencing accuracy.
5.4 Data Analysis
• Use automated bioinformatics pipeline for initial data processing,
including sequence alignment to the human genome reference
(hg38).
• Perform variant calling using variant callers like GATK or
equivalent.
• Annotate variants with databases (e.g., ClinVar, dbSNP).
5.5 Data Interpretation and Reporting
• Review the quality of sequencing data using appropriate metrics
(e.g., read depth, coverage).
• Pathogenic variants are identified as per the American College of
Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) guidelines.
• Confirm findings by visual inspection of alignments in Integrative
Genomics Viewer (IGV).
• Interpret and classify variants in the context of clinical data.
• Generate a comprehensive clinical report that includes
methodology, findings, interpretation, and recommendations.
6. QUALITY ASSURANCE
• Include positive and negative controls.
• Evaluate reproducibility by performing duplicate runs for random
samples.
• Utilize external proficiency testing programs.
• Document all steps, instruments, reagents, and results in the
laboratory information system (LIS).
7. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If poor quality or insufficient quantity DNA is obtained, repeat the
extraction protocol.
• For QC failures in library preparation, remake libraries from the
same DNA or new extractions.
• Resolve sequencing run failures per NGS instrument
troubleshooting guides.
• Reanalyze raw data if unexpected results are obtained.
8. SAFETY AND COMPLIANCE
• Follow established lab safety protocols during all procedures.
• Dispose of biohazard materials according to local regulations.
• Ensure compliance with CAP, CLIA, and HIPAA guidelines.
