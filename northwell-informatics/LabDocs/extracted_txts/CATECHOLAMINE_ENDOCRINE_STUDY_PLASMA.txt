Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Catecholamine, Endocrine Study, Plasma
1. PURPOSE
This SOP establishes the protocol for the analytical phase of
generating results for catecholamine levels in plasma during
endocrine studies. This document outlines the procedures followed in
our laboratory to ensure accurate, reliable, and reproducible results.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the
analysis according to this SOP and ensuring adherence to safety and
quality control protocols.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type:
• Plasma collected in EDTA tubes.
Specimen Volume:
• Minimum 3 mL plasma.
Specimen Stability:
• Plasma should be separated from the cells within 30 minutes of
collection.
• Once separated, plasma should be stored at -80°C until analysis.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed samples.
• Specimens not stored properly (e.g., not frozen immediately after
separation).
• Samples with visible contaminants or that are inadequately
labelled.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system with
electrochemical detection.
• Analytical-grade reagents and solvents (e.g., methanol,
acetonitrile).
• Catecholamine standards and internal standards.
• Nitrogen gas (for drying).
• Microcentrifuge.
• Vortex mixer.
• Pipettes and tips.
• Centrifuge tubes.
• Autosampler vials.
1. CALIBRATION AND QUALITY CONTROL
Calibration Curve:
• Prepare a calibration curve using catecholamine standards at
different concentrations.
• The calibration curve should have at least five concentration
points.
• Prepare and store calibration standards the same way as test
samples.
Quality Control:
• Include low, medium, and high concentration quality control (QC)
samples with each batch.
• QC samples should be within ±20% of their nominal values.
1. PROCEDURE
Plasma Sample Preparation:
• Thaw the plasma samples on ice.
• Centrifuge at 4°C at 10,000 rpm for 10 minutes to pellet any
remaining cellular debris.
• Transfer the supernatant to a new tube.
• Add internal standard to each sample and vortex briefly.
• Deproteinate by adding an equal volume of acetonitrile, vortex,
and incubate at 4°C for 10 minutes.
• Centrifuge at 4°C at 10,000 rpm for 10 minutes.
• Transfer the supernatant to an autosampler vial.
HPLC Analysis:
• Set up the HPLC system with an electrochemical detector.
• Ensure column and mobile phase are suitable for the separation
of catecholamines.
• Inject an appropriate volume of prepared sample (typically 20 µL).
• Run the HPLC method as per instrument specifications.
• Monitor and record detector responses for catecholamines,
comparing peak areas with calibration standards.
1. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
• Calculate catecholamine concentrations in the plasma samples
using the calibration curve.
• Ensure QC sample results fall within predefined acceptance
criteria.
• Any samples with outlying values (e.g., beyond QC acceptance
criteria) must be reanalyzed.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Document all findings in the laboratory information system (LIS).
• Review and verify results before releasing them to ensure
accuracy and compliance with QC standards.
• If critical values are identified, notify the appropriate clinical
personnel immediately according to laboratory protocol.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If unexpected high or low values are detected, recheck sample
preparation, calibration standards, and machine settings.
• For instrument issues, consult the equipment manual or technical
support.
• Repeat the analysis if QC samples are out of range or if there are
technical errors during the HPLC run.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Consult established clinical guidelines for reference intervals on
catecholamine levels in plasma.

Note: Adhere strictly to all safety guidelines and wear appropriate
personal protective equipment (PPE) throughout the procedure.
Regular instrument maintenance and calibration is essential to
ensure the HPLC system is functioning correctly.
