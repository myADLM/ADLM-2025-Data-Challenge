Standard Operating Procedure SOP Title: Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for CATECHOLAMINE FRACTIONATION, FREE,
24 HOUR, URINE
SOP Number: CA-01-2023
Effective Date: 10/01/2023
Review Date: 10/01/2024
1. PURPOSE:
This SOP outlines the procedure for the analytical phase, including
the preparation, testing, and reporting, for Catecholamine
Fractionation, Free, 24-hour Urine, including the quality control
measures to ensure accurate and reliable results.
2. SCOPE:
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel performing
Catecholamine Fractionation assays on 24-hour urine samples in a
CLIA-certified laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY:
• Laboratory Technologists: Ensure adherence to SOP, perform
tests, document results, and take necessary corrective actions.
• Supervisors: Ensure compliance, review documentation, and
troubleshoot as necessary.
4. DEFINITION:
Catecholamine fractionation involves the measurement of the
concentration of individual catecholamines (dopamine,
norepinephrine, and epinephrine) in urine collected over 24 hours.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES:
• High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system with
electrochemical detection.
• Reagents: Mobile phase (specific buffers and solutions),
standards (dopamine, norepinephrine, epinephrine), internal
standards, and calibration standards.
• 24-hour Urine specimen container with preservative (as specified
by laboratory SOP).
6. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS:
• Preferred: 24-hour urine collection with appropriate preservative.
• Storage and Stability: Store at 2-8°C if analysis will be
performed within 48 hours. Otherwise, freeze the aliquot at -20°C.
7. PROCEDURE:
A. Preparation:
1. Specimen Handling:
◦ Upon receipt, mix the 24-hour urine collection thoroughly.
◦ Measure and record the total volume.
◦ Aliquot the urine as needed and store appropriately
(refrigerated if within 48 hours, otherwise -20°C).
2. Calibration and Quality Control:
◦ Prepare calibration standards and internal standards
according to the manufacturer's guidelines.
◦ Validate the HPLC system daily with quality control samples
(low, medium, and high concentrations of catecholamines).
B. Analytical Process:
1. Instrument Setup:
◦ Ensure the HPLC system is properly calibrated and quality
controls are within acceptable limits.
◦ Program the HPLC with the appropriate method for
catecholamine fractionation.
2. Sample Preparation and Analysis:
◦ Pipette a specific volume of the urine sample into a
centrifuge tube.
◦ Add internal standards and mix by vortexing.
◦ Centrifuge the mixture at 4000 rpm for 10 minutes.
◦ Transfer the supernatant to an HPLC vial.
3. Injection and Run:
◦ Inject the prepared sample into the HPLC for analysis.
◦ Record the chromatogram and ensure the peaks for
dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine are well
resolved.
4. Result Calculation:
◦ Use the system software to integrate the peaks and
calculate concentrations based on calibration curves.
◦ Adjust results for total urine volume to obtain 24-hour
excretion values.
C. Data Review and Reporting:
1. Review Analytical Data:
◦ Verify the integration and calculation of each catecholamine
peak.
◦ Compare sample results with quality control and reference
standards to ensure accuracy.
2. Reporting Results:
◦ Enter the results into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
◦ Review and validate the reports according to site-specific
guidelines.
◦ Highlight and document any critical results according to
laboratory policy.
8. QUALITY CONTROL:
• Perform daily calibrations and run quality control samples at the
beginning and end of each batch of samples.
• Document all calibration and quality control data in appropriate
logs.
• Investigate and correct any deviations from expected results
before reporting.
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
• Ensure proper preservation of the 24-hour urine specimen
throughout collection and storage to avoid degradation of
catecholamines.
• High leptospirosis infection may interfere with results; refer to
manufacturer guidelines for specific interferences.
