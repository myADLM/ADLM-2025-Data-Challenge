Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Catecholamine
Fractionation, Free, Plasma
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to provide a detailed procedure for the
analysis of catecholamine fractions (epinephrine, norepinephrine,
and dopamine) in plasma samples. This process ensures the
accuracy, reliability, and reproducibility of test results.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for carrying out the
procedures outlined in this document. It is the responsibility of all staff
to identify any issues affecting the integrity of the analysis and report
these to a supervisor.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type:
• Plasma, collected in an EDTA or heparin tube.
Specimen Handling:
• After collection, the blood should be centrifuged at 1,000-2,000 x
g for 10-15 minutes to separate plasma within 15-30 minutes.
• Plasma must be transferred to a polypropylene tube and frozen
immediately at -70°C or lower.
• Avoid multiple freeze-thaw cycles.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed specimens.
• Specimens not properly frozen.
• Specimens received at room temperature or thawed more than
once.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
Equipment:
• High-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) system with
electrochemical detection.
• Centrifuge capable of achieving at least 2,000 x g.
• Pipettes and disposable tips.
• Polypropylene tubes.
• Freezer capable of -70°C or lower.
Reagents:
• Mobile phase solution for HPLC.
• Internal standard solution.
• Calibrators and control materials.
• Sample extraction reagents (e.g., alumina, ethylene diamine tetra-
acetic acid (EDTA), sodium metabisulfite).
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation
1. Thaw the plasma samples, calibrators, and controls rapidly at
37°C in a water bath and place on ice immediately after
thawing.
2. Mix by gentle inversion.
3. Label all tubes clearly with appropriate identification numbers.
B. Extraction of Catecholamines
1. To each sample, calibrator, and control, add an equal volume of
internal standard solution.
2. Add extraction reagents as per reagent manufacturer’s
instructions specific to catecholamine extraction.
3. Vortex mix for 30 seconds.
4. Apply the sample to pre-conditioned solid phase extraction
(SPE) columns.
5. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for washing and eluting
the columns.
6. Evaporate the eluted sample to dryness under a stream of
nitrogen gas.
C. HPLC Analysis
1. Reconstitute the dried extract in an appropriate volume of
mobile phase solution.
2. Transfer the reconstituted sample to HPLC vials, ensuring to
avoid bubbles.
3. Load the vials into the HPLC system.
4. Program the HPLC system with the correct method parameters,
including flow rate, gradient, column temperature, and detection
potential.
5. Run chromatographic analysis and acquire data.
D. Quality Control
1. Include both positive and negative controls in each run to
monitor the accuracy and precision of the analysis.
2. Perform a system suitability test before running samples to
ensure the HPLC system is functioning correctly.
3. If controls fall outside of acceptable limits, the run must be
invalidated, and the cause resolved before repeating the
analysis.
4. DATA ANALYSIS AND REPORTING
5. Qualitative Interpretation:
◦ Integrate the chromatograms using the specific software
associated with the HPLC system.
◦ Compare the retention times of the peaks to those of the
standards.
6. Quantitative Analysis:
◦ Calculate the concentrations of epinephrine, norepinephrine,
and dopamine using the internal standard method.
◦ Generate a calibration curve using the known
concentrations of the standards.
◦ Ensure that all points on the calibration curve show linearity
with an acceptable correlation coefficient (typically r ≥
0.990).
7. Reporting Results:
◦ Verify the results by checking against quality controls.
◦ Enter the validated results into the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
◦ Confirm abnormal or critical results and report following
laboratory policy.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS AND TROUBLESHOOTING
9. Ensure no interfering substances are present. Cross-reactivity
or matrix effects can lead to false results.
10. Maintain the HPLC system according to manufacturer
recommendations to prevent column clogging, pump failure, or
detector noise.
11. If unexpected results are obtained, re-extract and reanalyze the
sample. Consult with a supervisor if issues persist.

to incorporate new techniques and equipment.
