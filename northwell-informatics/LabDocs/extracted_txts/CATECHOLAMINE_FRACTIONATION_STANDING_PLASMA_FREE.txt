Standard Operating Procedure
CATECHOLAMINE FRACTIONATION,
STANDING, PLASMA, FREE
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the analysis of free
catecholamines (epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine) in
standing plasma samples. This ensures accuracy, precision, and
validity in the results generated for clinical diagnostics.
2. SCOPE
This protocol applies to all laboratory personnel performing the
analytical phase of catecholamine fractionation in plasma samples.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Technologists/Technicians: Responsible for performing the
procedure and ensuring all quality control measures are followed.
• Supervisors/Managers: Ensure adherence to the protocol,
provide necessary training, and validate equipment functionality.
4. DEFINITIONS
• HPLC with Electrochemical Detection (HPLC-ECD): A method
involving high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with
electrochemical detection, used for separating and quantifying
catecholamines.
5. EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS
Equipment:
• High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) with
Electrochemical Detector
• Centrifuge
• Refrigerated storage units
• Automated pipettes
• Vortex mixer
Reagents and Supplies:
• Stationary phase HPLC column specific for catecholamine
separation
• Mobile phase (e.g., phosphate buffer with an organic modifier)
• Internal standards (e.g., dihydroxybenzylamine)
• Plasma collection tubes containing sodium EDTA
• Catecholamine-free water
• Quality control materials
• Calibration standards for epinephrine, norepinephrine, and
dopamine
6. PROCEDURE
A) Sample Preparation
1. Initial Handling:
◦ Ensure plasma samples are received properly labeled and
stored at -80°C if not processed immediately.
◦ Thaw the plasma sample at 4°C overnight before analysis.
2. Centrifugation:
◦ Centrifuge the plasma sample at 2000 x g for 15 minutes at
4°C to remove any particulates.
◦ Transfer the supernatant to a clean microcentrifuge tube.
3. Internal Standard Addition:
◦ Add a known quantity of internal standard
(dihydroxybenzylamine) to the plasma sample and mix well
using a vortex mixer.
4. Solid Phase Extraction (SPE) (if applicable):
◦ Condition the SPE column with methanol followed by water.
◦ Apply the plasma sample to the conditioned SPE column
and wash with water.
◦ Elute catecholamines using a solvent, such as a mixture of
acetonitrile and water with a small amount of formic acid.
◦ Evaporate the solvent under nitrogen and reconstitute the
residue in the mobile phase.
B) HPLC-ECD Analysis
1. HPLC System Setup:
◦ Prepare the HPLC system with the appropriate column and
equilibrate with the mobile phase.
◦ Set the electrochemical detector to the correct settings (e.g.,
potential, sensitivity, and cell temperature).
2. Injecting the Sample:
◦ Inject a known volume (typically 20 µL) of the sample/
reconstituted extract into the HPLC system.
3. Chromatographic Separation:
◦ Run the sample through the HPLC system and collect the
chromatograms for catecholamines.
4. Quantification:
◦ Compare the peak areas of the sample with those of the
calibration standards.
◦ Use the internal standard to correct for any sample
preparation variability.
C) Quality Control
1. Calibration:
◦ Run calibration standards at the start of each batch.
◦ Prepare a calibration curve by plotting the peak areas
against the concentrations of the standards.
2. Quality Control Samples:
◦ Run quality control samples alongside patient samples to
ensure the accuracy and precision of the assay.
◦ Acceptable ranges for QC materials should be established
and monitored.
D) Reporting
1. Data Review:
◦ Verify each chromatogram for correct peak identification and
integration.
◦ Ensure all QC results fall within acceptable ranges.
2. Result Calculation:
◦ Calculate the concentrations of epinephrine, norepinephrine,
and dopamine using the calibration curve and internal
standard correction.
◦ Document and review results before reporting.
3. Documentation:
◦ Record all findings in the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
◦ Ensure each result is reviewed and verified by a senior
technologist or supervisor before releasing the results to the
clinician.
7. CRITICAL LIMITS AND ACTIONS
• Out of Range QC Results:
◦ Investigate and resolve any QC failures before reporting
patient results.
◦ Repeat analysis if necessary and take corrective actions as
per lab protocol.
• Sample Integrity Issues:
◦ Reject samples that show signs of hemolysis, clotting, or other
degradations.
◦ Inform the requesting clinician if sample recollection is
required.
