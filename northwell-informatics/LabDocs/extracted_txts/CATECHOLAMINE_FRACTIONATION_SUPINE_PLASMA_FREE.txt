Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Catecholamine
Fractionation, Supine, Plasma, Free
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the analytical phase of
generating results for Catecholamine Fractionation, Supine, Plasma,
Free. This procedure ensures accurate, consistent, and timely results
for clinical decision-making.
1. SCOPE
This SOP applies to the analytical process conducted in the
laboratory for the measurement of free catecholamines in plasma,
including norepinephrine, epinephrine, and dopamine.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
The analytical staff is responsible for performing the procedure as
outlined, ensuring all steps are followed correctly. Supervisors are
responsible for training, overseeing the process, and addressing any
issues or deviations.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND HANDLING
Specimen Type: Plasma Collection:
• Collect blood in a pre-chilled EDTA tube.
• Specimen must be kept on ice and centrifuged within 30 minutes
of collection.
• Plasma should be immediately separated and transferred to a
pre-chilled polypropylene tube.
• Store plasma at -80°C until analysis.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens that are hemolyzed, clotted, or not kept on ice
immediately after collection.
• Specimens that have not been separated from cells within 30
minutes.
• Specimens not stored at proper temperature or beyond 30 days at
-80°C.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system with
electrochemical detection (ECD)
• EDTA plasma collection tubes
• Pre-chilled polypropylene tubes
• Catecholamine standards: norepinephrine, epinephrine, and
dopamine
• Mobile phase reagents
• Internal standard solution
• Calibration curve standards and quality control materials
• Reagents for sample preparation: extraction buffer, stabilizing
agents
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation:
1. Calibrate the HPLC system with electrochemical detector
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Prepare mobile phase and other reagents as per the
manufacturer’s guidelines.
3. Thaw frozen plasma specimens on ice before analysis.
4. Ensure internal standards and catecholamine calibration
standards are prepared.
B. Sample Processing:
1. Add a predefined volume of plasma to a labeled extraction
tube.
2. Add an internal standard to each sample.
3. Vortex and centrifuge as needed to mix and separate layers.
4. Extract catecholamines using the appropriate extraction buffer.
5. Evaporate the extracted solution under nitrogen and
reconstitute in mobile phase.
C. HPLC Analysis:
1. Inject an appropriate volume of prepared sample into the HPLC
system.
2. Ensure the system is running with proper column temperature
and flow rate.
3. Run the prepared standards and quality control samples
alongside patient specimens.
4. Record the chromatographs and the retention times for
norepinephrine, epinephrine, and dopamine.
D. Data Analysis:
1. Compare the sample peaks and retention times to those of the
known standards.
2. Quantify the concentrations of norepinephrine, epinephrine, and
dopamine based on the calibration curve.
3. Ensure the internal standard is within the acceptable range for
accurate quantification.
E. Quality Control:
1. Run quality control samples at multiple levels with each batch
of patient specimens.
2. Verify that quality control results fall within accepted ranges.
3. If quality control results are out of range, troubleshoot the
system and repeat the analysis.
4. REPORTING RESULTS
Document the results in the laboratory information system (LIS).
Ensure that values are within the reference range:
• Norepinephrine: 80-520 pg/mL
• Epinephrine: 0-140 pg/mL
• Dopamine: <30 pg/mL
Flag and document any values that fall outside the established
reference ranges for clinical review. Include notes on any deviations
or issues encountered during the analytical process.
Communicate critical values to the attending physician as per
laboratory protocol and document the communication.

1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Ensure specimens are processed within specified time frames
and under appropriate conditions.
• Hemolyzed or improperly stored specimens can yield inaccurate
results.
• Instrument calibration, sample preparation, and processing must
be performed precisely to ensure consistency.
