Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating CATFISH (SILURIFORMES SPP) IGE Results
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the steps required for the analytical phase of
generating results for Catfish (Siluriformes spp) Immunoglobulin E
(IgE) testing. Accurate and timely analysis of IgE antibodies is
essential for diagnosing and managing allergic reactions to catfish.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the designated staff to perform the analytical
phase of the Catfish IgE testing according to this procedure. This
includes preparing reagents, operating the assay equipment,
interpreting results, documenting findings, and reporting results to the
appropriate healthcare providers.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• ELISA (Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay) plate reader.
• ELISA plates specific for Catfish IgE.
• Micropipettes with appropriate tips.
• Assay diluents and wash buffers.
• Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibodies.
• Substrate solution (TMB - 3,3',5,5'-Tetramethylbenzidine).
• Stop solution (1N HCl or appropriate alternative).
• Catfish IgE standard for calibration.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Serum or plasma samples.
• Samples should be centrifuged and the supernatant collected.
• Samples should be stored at -20°C or colder if not tested
immediately.
1. PROCEDURE
5.1 Preparation
1. Ensure all reagents are brought to room temperature before
use.
2. Prepare the wash buffer and other required reagents according
to the manufacturer’s instructions.
5.2 ELISA Procedure
1. Preparation of Standards and Samples:
◦ Dilute the Catfish IgE standards as instructed by the assay
kit.
◦ Dilute patient serum/plasma samples (typically 1:100, but
follow the kit instructions).
2. Plate Setup:
◦ Add 100 µL of standards, samples, and controls to the
appropriate wells on the ELISA plate.
◦ Cover the plate with adhesive seal or plate cover.
3. Incubation:
◦ Incubate the plate for the specified time and temperature
(usually 1-2 hours at room temperature or 37°C).
4. Washing:
◦ Wash the plate with wash buffer 3-5 times (follow the kit
instructions) using an automated plate washer or manually.
5. Secondary Antibody:
◦ Add 100 µL of HRP-conjugated secondary antibody to each
well.
◦ Incubate the plate for the specified time and temperature
(usually 30 minutes at room temperature or 37°C).
6. Washing:
◦ Wash the plate with wash buffer 3-5 times.
7. Substrate Addition:
◦ Add 100 µL of the TMB substrate solution to each well.
◦ Incubate the plate in the dark for the specified duration
(usually 10-30 minutes).
8. Stop Reaction:
◦ Add 50 µL of stop solution to each well to halt the reaction.
9. Reading:
◦ Measure the absorbance at 450 nm with a reference
wavelength of 620-650 nm using the ELISA plate reader.
5.3 Results Calculation
1. Generate a standard curve by plotting the absorbance of
standards against the known concentrations.
2. Calculate the IgE levels in patient samples by interpolating their
absorbance on the standard curve.
3. Ensure quality control samples fall within the acceptable range
to validate the assay.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
• Ensure all controls (negative and positive) are run with each batch
of tests.
• If controls do not fall within expected ranges, investigate the
cause and repeat the assay if necessary.
• Document all control results and any corrective actions taken.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Transcribe the IgE concentrations from the assay report to the
Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Review results for consistency and plausibility according to the
established reference ranges.
• Report any critical or abnormal results immediately to the
requesting healthcare provider, following laboratory protocol for
urgent results notification.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
As reference ranges can vary based on the population and the assay
kit used, refer to the manufacturer's guidelines for established
reference intervals or validate with clinical sources.
1. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS
• Follow all laboratory safety protocols, including the use of
personal protective equipment (PPE).
• Handle all biohazardous materials and reagents in accordance
with institution guidelines.
• Dispose of waste, including biological samples and chemical
reagents, according to safety regulations.
