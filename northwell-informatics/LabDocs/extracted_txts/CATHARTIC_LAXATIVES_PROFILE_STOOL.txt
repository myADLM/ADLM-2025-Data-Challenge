Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Cathartic Laxatives Profile, Stool
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to provide a detailed and standardized
methodology for the analysis and reporting of cathartic laxatives
profile in stool samples. Ensuring accurate and reliable results is
crucial for the diagnosis and management of patients who may have
consumed cathartic laxatives.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
• Specimens:
◦ Preferred: Freshly collected stool specimen in a sterile
container.
◦ Minimum volume: 10 grams.
◦ Collection: Ensure the patient avoids contamination with urine
or water. Use of a stool collection hat is recommended.
◦ Specimens should be collected without the use of
preservatives.
• Stability:
◦ Room Temperature (20-25°C): Stable for 1 hour.
◦ Refrigerated (2-8°C): Stable for up to 24 hours.
◦ Frozen (-20°C): Stable for up to 1 month.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Equipment:
◦ Centrifuge
◦ Refrigerators and freezers
◦ Analytical balance
◦ High-Performance Liquid Chromatograph (HPLC) with diode
array detector
◦ Vortex mixer
• Reagents:
◦ Mobile phase: Acetonitrile and water (HPLC grade)
◦ Standard cathartic laxative compounds (e.g., senna,
bisacodyl, phenolphthalein)
◦ Internal standard (if applicable)
◦ Extraction solvents (e.g., methanol, ethyl acetate)
• Supplies:
◦ Sterile containers
◦ Disposable pipettes
◦ Microcentrifuge tubes
◦ Syringes and HPLC-grade filters
1. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation:
1. Homogenization: Homogenize stool sample to ensure
uniformity.
2. Weighing: Weigh 5 grams of the homogenized stool sample
and transfer it to a clean beaker.
3. Extraction:
◦ Add 10 mL of extraction solvent to the stool sample.
◦ Vortex the mixture for 5 minutes.
◦ Centrifuge the mixture at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes.
◦ Transfer the supernatant to a clean tube.
4. Concentration:
◦ Evaporate the solvent under nitrogen gas or gentle heat
until dry.
◦ Reconstitute the residue in 1 mL of the mobile phase.
B. HPLC Analysis:
1. HPLC Setup:
◦ Column: C18 reversed-phase column.
◦ Mobile Phase: Gradient of acetonitrile and water.
◦ Flow rate: 1.0 mL/min.
◦ Detection wavelength: 254 nm.
2. Injection: Inject 20 µL of the reconstituted extract into the
HPLC system.
3. Run Time: Typical run time is 30 minutes.
4. Calibration and Quality Control:
◦ Run known standards of cathartic laxatives to create a
calibration curve.
◦ Include quality control samples (negative and positive
controls) with each batch of patient samples.
5. Interpretation of Results:
• Compare the retention times and peak areas of the patient
sample to the calibration standards to identify and quantify
cathartic laxatives.
• Report the concentrations of identified laxatives in the designated
reporting format.
1. Quality Control:
• Perform routine calibration and maintenance of the HPLC system.
• Use internal controls to verify the extraction efficiency and
accuracy of the assay.
• Document all steps thoroughly, including any deviations and
corrective actions taken.
1. REPORTING RESULTS:
• Results should be reviewed and verified by a qualified
technologist.
• Critical values or unusual findings should be promptly
communicated to the attending physician.
• Maintain all records of the analysis in accordance with laboratory
regulations and quality assurance guidelines.
1. REFERENCES:
• Manufacturer's manual for HPLC system.
• Literature on standard methods for stool analysis of cathartic
laxatives.
1. SAFETY AND COMPLIANCE:
• Ensure compliance with all safety protocols and use personal
protective equipment (PPE) appropriately.
• Handle all reagents and solvents in accordance with Material
Safety Data Sheets (MSDS).
By following this SOP, laboratory personnel can ensure the accuracy,
reliability, and consistency of cathartic laxatives analysis in stool
samples.
