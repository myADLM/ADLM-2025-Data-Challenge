Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Cathepsin K
Immunostain, Technical Component Only
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this standard operating procedure
(SOP) is to outline the technical process for performing Cathepsin K
Immunostain in a CLIA-certified laboratory. This procedure details the
steps necessary to ensure consistent and accurate results during the
analytical phase of testing.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
• Designated laboratory technologists are responsible for
performing the immunostaining procedure as described in this
SOP.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring that technologists are
trained and competent in this procedure. Supervisors also handle
troubleshooting and quality control oversight.
• Laboratory staff are responsible for identifying and reporting any
issues that might affect the quality of test results to their
supervisors.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue
sections.
• Section Thickness: 4-5 microns.
• Slide Preparation: Sections are mounted on positively charged
microscope slides.
4. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• Cathepsin K primary antibody
• Secondary antibody (HRP-conjugated)
• Diaminobenzidine (DAB) substrate
• Hematoxylin counterstain
• Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with Tween 20
• Blocking solution
• Antigen retrieval solution
• Mounting media
• Coverslips
• Positive controls (known tissues expressing Cathepsin K)
• Negative controls (omission of primary antibody)
5. EQUIPMENT
• Automated immunostainer or manual staining setup
• Microtome
• Water bath
• Slide drying oven
• Microwave or steamer for antigen retrieval
• Light microscope
6. PROCEDURE
A. Pre-Staining Preparation
1. Retrieve slides with FFPE tissue sections from storage.
2. Place slides in a 60°C oven for 1 hour to ensure proper
adhesion.
3. Dewax slides in xylene for 10 minutes (two changes).
4. Rehydrate slides through graded ethanol (100%, 95%, 70%,
and distilled water, each for 5 minutes).
B. Antigen Retrieval
1. Place slides in antigen retrieval solution and heat in a
microwave or steamer:
◦ Microwave: Heat on high for 10-15 minutes.
◦ Steamer: Steam for 20-40 minutes.
2. Allow slides to cool to room temperature in the solution.
3. Rinse slides in PBS with Tween 20 for 5 minutes (3 changes).
C. Blocking
1. Incubate slides in blocking solution for 10 minutes to prevent
non-specific binding.
D. Primary Antibody Incubation
1. Apply Cathepsin K primary antibody solution to the tissue
sections.
2. Incubate slides for 1 hour at room temperature or overnight at
4°C in a humidified chamber.
E. Secondary Antibody and Detection
1. Rinse slides in PBS with Tween 20 for 5 minutes (3 changes).
2. Apply HRP-conjugated secondary antibody and incubate for 30
minutes at room temperature.
3. Rinse slides in PBS with Tween 20 for 5 minutes (3 changes).
4. Prepare DAB substrate solution.
5. Apply DAB substrate to the tissue sections and incubate until
desired color development is achieved (typically 2-10 minutes).
6. Rinse slides in distilled water.
F. Counterstaining and Mounting
1. Counterstain slides with hematoxylin for 1-3 minutes.
2. Rinse slides in running tap water for 5 minutes.
3. Dehydrate slides through graded ethanol (70%, 95%, 100%,
each for 2 minutes).
4. Clear slides in xylene (two changes, 5 minutes each).
5. Apply mounting media and coverslip.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Include positive and negative control slides in each run to
ensure staining procedure integrity.
2. Review controls under a light microscope:
◦ Positive control must show appropriate staining.
◦ Negative control must show no staining.
3. Document and address any deviations from expected results.
8. DOCUMENTATION AND REPORTING
• Record all procedural details, including batch numbers of
reagents, incubation times, and observations, in the laboratory
logbook.
• Results reviewed by designated staff and discrepancies reported
to the supervising pathologist.
9. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If background staining is high, extend blocking times or review the
primary antibody concentration.
• If the staining is weak, verify antigen retrieval conditions and
primary antibody potency.
