Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Cat Epithelium, IgE, Serum Assay
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to provide step-by-step instructions for
the analytical phase of generating results for Cat Epithelium-specific
IgE in serum samples. The SOP ensures accurate, reliable, and
timely reporting of results.
1. RESPONSIBILITIES
• Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the
assay following this SOP.
• Supervisors are responsible for overseeing the procedure,
ensuring compliance, and addressing any issues that may arise.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Serum
• Collection Tube: SST (Serum Separator Tube) or red-top tube
without anticoagulant
• Volume: Minimum 0.5 mL of serum
• Storage: Specimens should be stored at 2-8°C if analyzed within
48 hours; for longer storage, freeze at -20°C or colder.
• Unacceptable Specimens: Hemolyzed, lipemic, or contaminated
samples.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Immunoassay Analyzer (e.g., ImmunoCAP® or equivalent)
• Specific reagent kit for Cat Epithelium-specific IgE
• Calibrators and controls specific for the assay
• Standard laboratory supplies (pipettes, tips, tubes, etc.)
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) for laboratory safety
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run appropriate quality control (QC) samples (positive and
negative controls) with each batch of patient samples.
• Ensure QC results fall within the established acceptable range
before analyzing patient samples.
• Document QC results and take corrective actions if necessary.
1. PROCEDURE
2. Preparation
◦ Review and verify specimen integrity upon receipt.
◦ Allow refrigerated/frozen serum samples to reach room
temperature prior to assay setup.
◦ Vortex samples gently to mix well before use.
3. Instrument Calibration
◦ Ensure the immunoassay analyzer is calibrated according to
the manufacturer's instructions.
◦ Use manufacturer-supplied calibrators to perform a
calibration curve if required by the analyzer protocol.
4. Assay Procedure
◦ Load reagents, calibrators, controls, and patient samples
onto the analyzer as per manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Program the analyzer with the appropriate assay protocol
for Cat Epithelium-specific IgE.
◦ Start the assay run, ensuring all samples and reagents are
correctly placed and identified.
5. Post-Run Review
◦ Upon completion of the assay, review analyzer run data and
ensure QC results are within the acceptable range.
◦ Validate patient results only if QC results meet criteria.
Investigate and troubleshoot if QC fails.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
• Transmit results from the analyzer to the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
• Review and verify results in the LIS for accuracy.
• Report Cat Epithelium-specific IgE concentrations in kU/L,
including reference intervals provided by the reagent
manufacturer.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Results interpretation should follow the reference intervals
provided by the assay manufacturer or based on established
clinical guidelines.
• Typically, the reference range may classify IgE levels as:
◦ Negative: <0.35 kU/L
◦ Low to Moderate: 0.35 – 3.5 kU/L
◦ High: >3.5 kU/L
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• The assay is specific for detecting IgE antibodies to Cat
Epithelium in serum.
• Hemolyzed or lipemic samples may interfere with results and
should be avoided.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If ionic, temperature, or pressure changes affect the assay, follow
analyzer troubleshooting manuals.
• Repeat the assay if results are inconsistent or if QC criteria are
not met.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's instruction manual for Immunoassay Analyzer
• Kit insert for Cat Epithelium-specific IgE assay
• Clinical Laboratory Standards (CLSI) guidelines
1. DOCUMENTATION
• Maintain records of all assay runs, including QC results and any
deviations from the protocol.
• Document corrective actions taken in case of assay failure or QC
issues.
1. REVIEW AND REVISION HISTORY
• This SOP will be reviewed annually and revised as necessary to
incorporate new guidelines or procedures.
