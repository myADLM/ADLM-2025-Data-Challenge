Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
1. PURPOSE To provide detailed instructions for the analytical
phase of generating results for Cat Epithelium, IgE, with reflex
to Cat Epithelium Components, IgE, Serum testing.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for
performing and documenting the assay as per this SOP. It is the
responsibility of all staff to identify and report any deficiencies or
anomalies to a supervisor.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS Preferred Specimen:
• Serum collected in a red top tube or SST.
• Minimum volume: 1 mL serum.
• Specimens should be processed and stored at 2-8°C if not
analyzed immediately.
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Specimens with gross hemolysis or lipemia.
• Specimens collected in anticoagulant tubes (e.g., EDTA, sodium
citrate).
• Samples that are not properly labeled with patient identification.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Immunoassay analyzer: e.g., ImmunoCAP® 100
• Cat Epithelium-specific IgE reagents.
• Calibrators and controls: low, medium, and high concentration.
• Micropipettes and disposable tips.
• Serum separator tubes (SST).
• Data collection and logging sheets.
1. PROCEDURE A. Preparation and Setup:
2. Review the testing schedule and ensure all necessary reagents
and supplies are available.
3. Check the immunoassay analyzer for proper functioning and
ensure it is calibrated.
4. Verify the proper storage of reagents and controls.
B. Specimen Processing: 4. Centrifuge serum separator tubes (SST)
at ≈3,000 rpm for 10 minutes. 5. Transfer the serum to a labeled
aliquot tube ensuring no cellular material is transferred. 6. Store the
aliquot at 2-8°C until analysis, and ensure analysis is performed
within 24 hours.
C. Assay Procedure: 7. Prepare the specimens, controls, and
calibrators according to the manufacturer’s instructions. 8. Load
specimens, controls, and calibrators onto the immunoassay analyzer.
9. Initiate the Cat Epithelium, IgE assay process according to the
analyzer instructions. 10. The analyzer will automatically process the
serum samples and generate quantitative results for Cat Epithelium-
specific IgE. 11. Review the results for quality control and verification.
D. Reflex Testing: 12. If the Cat Epithelium-specific IgE result is
above the established threshold (e.g., ≥0.35 kUA/L), additional
testing for Cat Epithelium components will be automatically triggered
(reflex test). 13. Perform the reflex testing for specific Cat Epithelium
components (e.g., Fel d 1, Fel d 2) as per the assay procedure. 14.
Document and review reflex test results.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run appropriate quality controls with each batch of specimens.
• Verify control results are within acceptable limits before accepting
patient results.
• Record quality control findings and any corrective actions taken.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Transfer assay results to the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Ensure results meet quality control criteria.
• Review and verify results prior to patient report generation.
• Report reflex test results alongside primary results if triggered.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Negative: <0.35 kUA/L (Cat Epithelium-specific IgE)
• Positive: ≥0.35 kUA/L (Reflex testing for Cat Epithelium
components required)
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to manufacturer’s insert for specific limitations related to
analyte stability, interference, and other analytical factors.
1. DOCUMENTATION
• Maintain records of all specimen processing, quality control, and
result reports.
• Ensure proper documentation of any deviations or corrective
actions performed.

This SOP will be reviewed and updated annually or as needed based
on changes in procedures or instrumentation. All personnel must
undergo training and competency assessment for adherence to this
SOP.
