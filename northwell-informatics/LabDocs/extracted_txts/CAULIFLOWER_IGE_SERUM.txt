Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Cauliflower Specific IgE in Serum
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the procedure for the analysis and generation of
results for Cauliflower specific IgE in serum samples. It is designed to
ensure consistent, accurate, and reliable testing in the laboratory.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the trained technologist to perform the
analysis as outlined in this procedure. Supervisors are responsible
for ensuring that the technologists are adequately trained and that
the laboratory maintains compliance with this SOP.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Immunoassay Analyzer (e.g., Phadia 250)
• Cauliflower Specific IgE reagent kit
• Calibrators and Controls
• Sample tubes and pipettes
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
1. SPECIMEN HANDLING AND PREPARATION
• Specimen type: Serum
• Preferred volume: 1 - 2 mL
• Stability: Serum must be separated from the clot within 2 hours of
collection and can be stored at 2-8°C for up to 72 hours or frozen
at -20°C for longer storage.
• Unacceptable conditions: Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples
may yield inaccurate results.
1. PROCEDURE
5.1. Instrument Preparation
• Turn on the immunoassay analyzer and allow it to warm up to
operational temperature.
• Perform daily quality control checks as per instrument guidelines
and document the results.
5.2. Reagent Preparation
• Prepare reagents, calibrators, and controls according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
• Ensure that all reagents are within their expiration dates and have
been stored at the recommended temperatures.
5.3. Sample Preparation
• Centrifuge the serum sample if not already separated.
• Transfer the required volume of serum (as specified by the
reagent kit) into a sample tube labeled with the patient’s
identification.
5.4. Analysis
• Load the prepared serum samples, calibrators, and controls onto
the immunoassay analyzer.
• Configure the analyzer by selecting the Cauliflower IgE assay
from the instrument’s test menu.
• Initiate the run following the manufacturer’s protocol.
5.5. Generating Results
• Upon completion of the assay, review the data generated by the
analyzer.
• Validate the results of the calibrators and controls. Ensure that all
controls are within the specified limits before accepting patient
results.
• Print and/or export the results from the analyzer.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run external quality controls at the beginning of each shift, after
any major maintenance, and whenever there is doubt about the
accuracy of the displayed results.
• Document quality control results in the Quality Control Log.
• Take corrective actions if quality control results are outside the
acceptable range.
• For instrument maintenance, follow the manufacturer's preventive
maintenance schedule and document actions taken.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results should be reviewed and verified by the technologist
before being reported.
• Any critical or unusual results must be flagged and brought to the
attention of a supervisor for further review.
• Results should be reported in kilounits per liter (kU/L).
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• The reference interval provided by the manufacturer or laboratory-
specific validated reference intervals should be used for
interpreting results.
• Standard classification (e.g., Class 0 to Class 6) for specific IgE
levels may be referenced.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• The results from this assay should be used in conjunction with
clinical findings and other laboratory tests.
• Heterophilic antibodies in serum samples may interfere with
immunoassays.
1. SAFETY PRECAUTIONS
• All serum specimens should be handled as potentially infectious.
• Wear appropriate PPE (gloves, lab coat, and eye protection)
when handling specimens, reagents, and the analyzer.
• Follow laboratory biosafety and chemical safety protocols.

This SOP is effective as of October 2023, and revisions may be
made as required to maintain compliance with regulatory changes
and advancements in technology.
