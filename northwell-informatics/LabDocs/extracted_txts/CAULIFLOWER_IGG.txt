CAULIFLOWER IgG SOP
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedures necessary to accurately measure and
report Cauliflower-specific IgG levels in patient serum samples.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the
Cauliflower-specific IgG tests as defined in this protocol. It is the
responsibility of all staff to ensure the tests are performed accurately
and that quality control metrics are met. Supervisors must ensure
adherence to this SOP and act upon any deviations.
1. DEFINITION
Cauliflower IgG is the immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody specific to
antigens present in cauliflower. Measurement of Cauliflower IgG
levels can be used to assess potential food sensitivities or allergies.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen Type:
• Serum (preferred) or plasma.
Specimen Collection and Handling:
• Collect 5-10 mL of blood into a serum separator tube (SST) or
heparinized plasma tube.
• Allow blood to clot for 30 minutes if using SST, then centrifuge for
15 minutes at 1500 x g.
• Transfer the serum into a clean, properly labeled aliquot tube.
• Store serum samples at 2-8°C if analyzed within 24 hours. For
longer storage, freeze at -20°C, and avoid repeated thaw-freeze
cycles.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
• Samples stored at room temperature for more than 8 hours.
• Samples frozen and thawed more than twice.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• ELISA Reader capable of reading absorbances at 450 nm.
• Precision pipettes (10-1000 µL) and tips.
• Cauliflower IgG ELISA Kit (Containing microtiter plate coated with
cauliflower antigens, IgG standards, controls, washing buffer,
substrate reagent, stopping solution).
• Timer.
• Vortex mixer.
• Plate washer (optional).
1. PROCEDURE
Quality Control:
• Run calibrator and control samples with each batch of tests.
• Record results in quality control log to ensure proper performance
of the assay.
Test Procedure:
1. Bring all reagents and samples to room temperature (18-25°C)
before use.
2. Prepare all reagents, standards, and samples as directed by
the Cauliflower IgG ELISA Kit insert.
3. Prepare microtiter wells by adding 100 µL of standards,
controls, and patient samples to respective wells. Each sample
should be run in duplicate.
4. Incubate the plate at 37°C for 1 hour.
5. Wash the plate 5 times with 300 µL of washing buffer. Remove
any residual wash buffer by tapping the plate firmly on
absorbent paper.
6. Add 100 µL of enzyme conjugate to each well and incubate for
30 minutes at 37°C.
7. Wash the plate 5 times with 300 µL of washing buffer.
8. Add 100 µL of substrate solution to each well and incubate in
the dark at room temperature for 15 minutes.
9. Stop the reaction by adding 50 µL of stopping solution to each
well.
10. Read the absorbance of each well at 450 nm using the ELISA
reader within 10 minutes of stopping the reaction.
11. Calculate the results using a standard curve generated from the
absorbance values of the standards.
12. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results are calculated and interpreted according to the
instructions provided with the ELISA kit.
• Compare the patient results against reference intervals provided
by the kit manufacturer or determine locally validated reference
intervals.
• Enter all results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS) for
report generation and clinical review.
• Abnormal or critical results must be verified and documented
according to laboratory policy.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Reference intervals and cutoff values will be determined as per
the ELISA kit insert or validated locally.
• Typically, a result of <10 IU/mL is considered negative for
Cauliflower-specific IgG, while results >40 IU/mL are considered
positive.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Results should be interpreted in conjunction with other clinical and
laboratory findings.
• Cross-reactivity with other antigens may occur.
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric specimens can interfere with assay
performance and must be avoided.
1. QUALITY ASSURANCE
• Perform calibration checks and maintain equipment regularly.
• Internal control samples (positive and negative) should be
included in each assay run to validate the assay performance.
• Participate in external quality assurance programs when
available.
