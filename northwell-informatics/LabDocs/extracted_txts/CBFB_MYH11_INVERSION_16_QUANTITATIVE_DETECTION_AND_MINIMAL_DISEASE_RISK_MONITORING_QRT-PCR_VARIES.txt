Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for CBFB::MYH11
Inversion(16) Quantitative Detection and Minimal Disease Risk
Monitoring QRT-PCR
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedures for the
quantitative detection of CBFB::MYH11 inversion(16) for
monitoring minimal residual disease (MRD) using quantitative
reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (QRT-PCR).
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all qualified laboratory personnel to
adhere to this SOP when performing CBFB::MYH11
inversion(16) quantitative detection and MRD monitoring. All
results must be validated, documented, and reported according
to the guidelines.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
◦ Preferred Specimen: Peripheral blood (PB) or bone
marrow (BM) aspirate in EDTA tubes.
◦ Specimen Stability: Samples should be processed within
24 hours of collection. If delay is unavoidable, samples must
be stored at 2-8°C and processed within 48 hours.
◦ Unacceptable Specimens:
▪ Samples that are not properly labeled.
▪ Samples received in heparin tubes.
▪ Clotted blood samples.
▪ Samples that exceed the 48-hour stability period.
4. EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS
◦ QRT-PCR machine.
◦ RNase/DNase-free tubes.
◦ RNA extraction kit.
◦ CBFB::MYH11 specific primers and probes.
◦ Reverse transcription reagents.
◦ PCR reagents (e.g., Taq polymerase, dNTPs, magnesium
chloride).
◦ Positive and negative controls.
◦ Reference gene primers and probes (e.g., ABL1).
5. PROCEDURE
A. RNA Extraction: 1. Use an RNA extraction kit to extract total
RNA from the specimen as per the manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Assess RNA purity and concentration using a
spectrophotometer.
B. cDNA Synthesis: 1. Prepare the cDNA synthesis reaction
by combining RNA, reverse transcription reagents, and random
primers. 2. Incubate the reaction mixture according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
C. QRT-PCR Setup: 1. Prepare the QRT-PCR reaction mix: -
Template cDNA. - CBFB::MYH11 specific primers and probe. -
PCR master mix. - Reference gene primers and probe (in a
separate reaction). 2. Load the prepared reaction mix into the
QRT-PCR machine. 3. Run the QRT-PCR program: - Initial
denaturation: 95°C for 10 minutes. - 40 cycles of: -
Denaturation: 95°C for 15 seconds. - Annealing/Extension:
60°C for 1 minute.
D. Controls: 1. Include positive control (known CBFB::MYH11
fusion positive sample) and negative control (no template
control). 2. Each run should also include a reference gene (e.g.,
ABL1) to ensure the quality of RNA and PCR efficiency.
6. RESULT ANALYSIS
◦ Analyze amplification plots to determine the Ct values for
target and reference genes.
◦ Calculate the ΔCt value (Ct of target gene - Ct of reference
gene).
◦ Determine the relative expression of CBFB::MYH11 using
the ΔΔCt method:
▪ ΔΔCt = ΔCt(sample) - ΔCt(control).
▪ Relative expression = 2^(-ΔΔCt).
7. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Ensure all controls fall within the expected range.
◦ Repeat any runs where controls fail or results are
inconsistent.
◦ Document all deviations and corrective actions.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ Report results as a ratio of CBFB::MYH11 to reference gene
expression.
◦ Indicate whether the expression level is within normal,
increased, or decreased compared to control samples.
◦ Clearly state the MRD status and include interpretative
comments if necessary.
◦ Follow laboratory-specific guidelines for entering and
verifying results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
9. REFERENCE INTERVALS
◦ CBFB::MYH11-negative samples should show no
amplification of the target gene.
◦ MRD threshold and classification: report any detected fusion
transcript and include clinical relevance in the context of
patient monitoring.
10. METHOD LIMITATIONS
◦ Sensitivity of the assay is dependent on RNA quality and
concentration.
◦ Potential for contamination; strict adherence to RNA
handling protocols.
11. REFERENCES
◦ Manufacturer’s instructions for RNA extraction kit and QRT-
PCR reagents.
◦ Relevant clinical guidelines and peer-reviewed publications
on CBFB::MYH11 detection and MRD monitoring.
All personnel must be appropriately trained in this SOP prior to
performing the CBFB::MYH11 Inversion(16) Quantitative Detection
and MRD monitoring.
