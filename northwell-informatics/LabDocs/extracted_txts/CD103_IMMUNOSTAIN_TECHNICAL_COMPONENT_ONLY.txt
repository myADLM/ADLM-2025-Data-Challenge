CD103 Immunostain - Technical Component Only Protocol
1. PURPOSE
To outline the standardized procedure for performing the technical
component of the CD103 immunostain analysis in order to ensure
accurate and consistent generation of results.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for
performing the CD103 immunostain according to this protocol and
ensuring that all quality control measures are adhered to.
1. SCOPE
This procedure applies to the analytical phase of the CD103
immunostain technique, assuming the specimen has been properly
collected, received, and accessioned. It includes steps from slide
preparation to staining and initial technical verification, excluding
interpretation.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
◦ Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue sections
◦ Specimen should be fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin
and processed to paraffin blocks.
◦ Tissue sections should be cut to 3-5 micrometers and
mounted on positively charged slides.
2. REAGENTS AND EQUIPMENT
◦ Primary antibody: Anti-CD103
◦ Secondary antibody: HRP-conjugated
◦ Detection system: DAB or appropriate chromogen substrate
◦ Antigen retrieval solutions: Citrate buffer (pH 6.0) or Tris-
EDTA buffer (pH 9.0)
◦ Wash buffers: Tris-buffered saline (TBS) with Tween 20
◦ Counterstain: Hematoxylin or other nuclear stain
◦ Mounting medium
◦ Microscope
◦ Positive control slide: Known CD103 positive tissue
◦ Negative control slide: Known CD103 negative tissue or
primary antibody omitted
3. PROCEDURE
5.1. Pre-Staining Preparation
• Ensure all reagents and solutions are prepared according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
• Check all equipment and slides for cleanliness and proper
functioning.
• Label slides clearly with unique identifiers.
5.2. Antigen Retrieval
• Deparaffinize and rehydrate tissue sections using xylene and
graded ethanol series.
• Perform antigen retrieval by immersing slides in citrate buffer (pH
6.0) or Tris-EDTA buffer (pH 9.0) and heating in a microwave or
pressure cooker for 20 minutes.
• Allow slides to cool for 20 minutes at room temperature.
5.3. Blocking and Immunostaining
• Wash slides in TBS with Tween 20.
• Block endogenous peroxidase activity by incubating slides in
0.3% hydrogen peroxide for 10 minutes.
• Apply blocking serum to prevent non-specific binding; incubate for
20 minutes.
• Apply the primary antibody (Anti-CD103) to each slide and
incubate for 30-60 minutes at room temperature.
• Rinse slides thoroughly in TBS with Tween 20.
5.4. Detection
• Apply the HRP-conjugated secondary antibody to each slide and
incubate for 30 minutes.
• Rinse slides thoroughly in TBS with Tween 20.
• Add DAB or appropriate chromogen substrate to each slide and
incubate until the desired staining intensity is achieved, typically
5-10 minutes.
• Rinse slides in distilled water.
5.5. Counterstaining and Mounting
• Counterstain tissue sections with hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes.
• Rinse slides in distilled water and then in a series of ethanol and
xylene for dehydration.
• Mount slides with permanent mounting medium and coverslip.
5.6. Quality Control
• Include a positive control slide with known CD103 positive tissue.
• Include a negative control slide by either omitting the primary
antibody or using known CD103 negative tissue.
• Examine control slides to ensure the staining procedure is
working correctly.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ Results are documented with a note on the technical
adequacy of the staining.
◦ The stained slides are handed over to the pathologist for
interpretation.
2. MAINTENANCE
◦ Regularly check and maintain all equipment used for
staining.
◦ Ensure proper documentation of reagent lot numbers and
expiration dates.
3. REFERENCES
◦ Manufacturer’s instructions for primary and secondary
antibodies.
◦ Laboratory’s internal quality control policies and
troubleshooting guidelines.
