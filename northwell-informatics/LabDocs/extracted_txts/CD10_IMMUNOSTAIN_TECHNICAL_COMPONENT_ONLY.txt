Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for CD10 Immunostain,
Technical Component Only
1. PURPOSE
To outline the analytical procedure for performing CD10 immunostain
on tissue specimen, ensuring the technical component is conducted
consistently and accurately.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory technologist is responsible for performing the
immunostain procedure following this SOP. All staff involved should
bring to the attention of the supervisor any irregularities observed
during the procedure.
3. DEFINITIONS
The CD10 immunostain is used to identify the presence of CD10
antigen in tissue sections, which serves as a marker in various
cancer diagnostics.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Acceptable: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue
sections mounted on charged glass slides.
• Unacceptable: Unfixed tissues, improperly embedded tissues,
sections with artifacts that could interfere with staining quality.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Automated stainer
• CD10 primary antibody
• Buffer solutions (e.g., phosphate-buffered saline, PBS)
• Detection system (HRP or AP conjugated secondary antibodies)
• Chromogen (e.g., DAB or Fast Red substrate)
• Counterstain (e.g., Hematoxylin)
• Coverslips and mounting medium
• Positive and negative control tissues
• Timer
• Microscopy slides
6. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Check the specimen integrity and verify patient information on
slides.
2. Prepare reagents and solutions as per manufacturer’s
instructions.
3. Ensure appropriate calibration and maintenance of the
automated stainer.
Staining Process:
1. Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
◦ Place slides in xylene for 3 cycles of 5 minutes each.
◦ Rehydrate through graded ethanol series (100%, 95%,
70%) for 2 minutes each; rinse in deionized water.
2. Antigen Retrieval:
◦ Perform heat-induced retrieval by immersing slides into the
retrieval buffer; place in a microwave or pressure cooker,
following specific retrieval buffer instructions.
◦ Allow to cool and rinse slides in PBS.
3. Blocking:
◦ Incubate slides with a blocking solution to minimize non-
specific binding.
4. Primary Antibody Application:
◦ Apply CD10 primary antibody diluted appropriately.
◦ Incubate slides as per manufacturer’s recommended time
(e.g., 30-60 minutes).
◦ Rinse slides in PBS to remove unbound primary antibody.
5. Detection:
◦ Apply secondary antibody (HRP or AP conjugated), and
incubate for recommended duration (e.g., 30 minutes).
◦ Rinse slides in PBS.
6. Chromogen Application:
◦ Develop the chromogen reaction by incubating slides with
DAB or Fast Red substrate until the desired intensity is
achieved.
◦ Rinse slides in deionized water to stop the reaction.
7. Counterstaining:
◦ Immerse slides in hematoxylin for suitable time to
counterstain.
◦ Rinse, dehydrate, and clear slides using graded ethanol and
xylene series.
8. Cover-slipping:
◦ Apply coverslips using mounting medium suitable for the
chromogen used.
Quality Control:
1. Stain positive and negative control tissues alongside the patient
specimens.
2. Evaluate controls for correct staining before recording patient
results.
3. Document staining results and any discrepancies in a logbook.
Reporting Results:
Positive staining in control verifies technical accuracy. Review
staining quality, and if acceptable, send slides for pathologist
interpretation.
7. TROUBLESHOOTING
• Incomplete Staining: Verify reagent expiration, staining time,
and incubation temperature. Re-run staining if required.
• High background: Check blocking step and reagent
concentrations; adjust blocking time or revalidate antibodies.
• Artifact Presence: Ensure proper tissue processing, embedding,
and sectioning techniques.
Each technologist must follow this SOP meticulously to ensure the
reliability and reproducibility of the CD10 immunostain results. Any
constant discrepancies must be reported to the supervisor
immediately for further action.
