STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE
CD11C IMMUNOSTAIN - TECHNICAL COMPONENT ONLY
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for performing CD11C
immunostaining, ensuring consistent and accurate results in the
detection of CD11C antigen expression in tissue samples.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all designated laboratory personnel
performing immunohistochemistry (IHC) for CD11C on tissue
sections in a CLIA-certified laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITIES
• Designated Staff: Perform CD11C immunostaining according to
this SOP and document all steps accordingly.
• Supervisors: Ensure adherence to this SOP and address any
issues that may affect the quality of the results.
4. DEFINITION
CD11C is an integrin protein subunit, important for adhesion and
immune responses. Immunostaining for CD11C is used to detect its
expression in various tissues, often for research and diagnostic
purposes.
5. MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT
• Tissue sections (paraffin-embedded or frozen)
• Primary antibody: Anti-CD11C
• Secondary antibody (HRP-conjugated)
• Detection system (e.g., DAB substrate)
• PBS buffer (Phosphate-buffered saline)
• Blocking solution (e.g., normal serum)
• Antibody diluent
• Mounting medium
• Coverslips
• Positive and negative control tissues
• Microscope
• Microtome
• Water bath
• Humidity chamber
6. PROCEDURE
A. Pre-analytical preparation
1. Tissue Sectioning
◦ Section paraffin-embedded tissue at 4-5 µm thickness or
cryosection frozen tissue at 4-5 µm.
◦ Mount each section on a charged slide.
◦ Label slides with specimen identification.
2. Deparaffinization and Rehydration (for paraffin-embedded
tissues only)
◦ Heat slides at 60°C for 1 hour.
◦ Deparaffinize in xylene for 3 x 5 minutes.
◦ Rehydrate through graded alcohols: 100%, 95%, 80%, 70%
ethanol, 5 minutes each.
◦ Rinse in distilled water for 5 minutes.
B. Immunostaining Procedure
1. Antigen Retrieval
◦ Perform antigen retrieval according to protocol specific for
CD11C antibody (e.g., heat-induced epitope retrieval (HIER)
in citrate buffer, pH 6.0, in a microwave or pressure cooker).
◦ Cool slides to room temperature.
◦ Rinse in PBS buffer, 2 x 5 minutes.
2. Blocking
◦ Incubate sections with blocking solution to prevent non-
specific binding.
◦ Duration and composition of the blocking solution depend
on the antibody and tissue type (often 10-20 minutes at
room temperature).
3. Primary Antibody Incubation
◦ Dilute the anti-CD11C antibody in antibody diluent as
recommended by the manufacturer.
◦ Apply to tissue sections and incubate in a humidified
chamber for 1-2 hours at room temperature or overnight at
4°C.
4. Washing
◦ Rinse slides in PBS buffer, 3 x 5 minutes.
5. Secondary Antibody Incubation
◦ Apply the HRP-conjugated secondary antibody and incubate
for 30-60 minutes at room temperature in a humidified
chamber.
6. Washing
◦ Rinse slides in PBS buffer, 3 x 5 minutes.
7. Detection
◦ Apply DAB substrate to the sections and incubate until the
desired color intensity is reached (typically 3-10 minutes).
◦ Monitor under a microscope to prevent overdevelopment.
8. Counterstaining
◦ Optional: counterstain with hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes.
◦ Rinse in running water for 5 minutes to remove excess
stain.
9. Dehydration and Mounting
◦ Dehydrate through graded alcohols: 70%, 80%, 95%, 100%
ethanol, 5 minutes each.
◦ Clear in xylene, 3 x 5 minutes.
◦ Apply mounting medium and coverslip.
C. Quality Control
1. Control Slides
◦ Include positive and negative control tissues in each
staining run to ensure assay integrity.
◦ Positive control should demonstrate expected staining
patterns.
◦ Negative control (omission of primary antibody) should show
no specific staining.
2. Documentation
◦ Record the lot numbers and expiration dates of all reagents
used.
◦ Document the staining procedure, including any deviations
from the SOP and corrective actions taken.
D. Interpretation of Results
1. Microscopic Evaluation
◦ Evaluate stained slides under a microscope.
◦ The intensity and distribution of CD11C staining should be
assessed by a trained pathologist or technologist.
2. Reporting
◦ Only technical results (staining quality, presence of staining)
are provided.
◦ Note any aberrations or issues encountered during the
staining process.
