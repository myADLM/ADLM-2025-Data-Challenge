Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for CD123 Immunostain,
Technical Component Only
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the steps to perform CD123 immunohistochemistry
staining for technical component only in order to provide accurate
and reproducible staining for diagnostic purposes.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing CD123
immunostain following this procedure, ensuring stain quality and
proper documentation.
1. DEFINITION
CD123 (Interleukin-3 receptor subunit alpha) is an important marker
used in the diagnosis of certain hematologic conditions.
Immunohistochemistry staining for CD123 is performed to assess the
presence and distribution of this marker in tissue specimens.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND PREPARATION
• Tissue type: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue
sections.
• Minimum thickness: 4 micrometers.
• Number of sections: At least one section per slide.
• Positive control: Known positive tissue section should be included
in each staining batch.
1. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• Primary antibody: Anti-CD123 antibody (optimized dilution as per
manufacturer’s guidelines).
• Secondary antibody: HRP-conjugated secondary antibody.
• Blocking solution: Appropriate blocking buffer to prevent non-
specific binding.
• Detection kit: DAB substrate for chromogenic detection.
• Wash buffer: 0.01M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or
manufacturer recommended washing solution.
• Mounting medium: Non-aqueous or aqueous mounting medium
for coverslip application.
• Slides: Glass slides suitable for IHC.
1. PROCEDURE
A) Slide Preparation:
1. Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
◦ Place slides in xylene for 3 x 5 minutes.
◦ Gradually rehydrate slides in decreasing concentrations of
ethanol (100% ethanol, 95% ethanol, 70% ethanol, and
distilled water) for 5 minutes each.
2. Antigen Retrieval:
◦ Heat-induced epitope retrieval using citrate buffer (pH 6.0)
or EDTA buffer (pH 8.0).
▪ Place slides in retrieval buffer and heat in microwave or
pressure cooker at sub-boiling temperature for 20
minutes.
▪ Cool slides naturally for 20 minutes and wash in PBS.
3. Blocking:
◦ Apply blocking solution to the slides to prevent non-specific
binding.
◦ Incubate for 10 minutes at room temperature.
B) Staining:
1. Primary Antibody Incubation:
◦ Apply the diluted primary antibody to the tissue sections.
◦ Incubate for 1 hour at room temperature or overnight at 4°C.
2. Washing:
◦ Wash slides in PBS (3 x 5 minutes) to remove excess
primary antibody.
3. Secondary Antibody Incubation:
◦ Apply HRP-conjugated secondary antibody.
◦ Incubate for 30 minutes at room temperature.
4. Washing:
◦ Wash slides in PBS (3 x 5 minutes) to remove excess
secondary antibody.
5. Chromogenic Detection:
◦ Apply DAB substrate to the slides.
◦ Monitor development under microscope; typically takes 5-10
minutes for color development.
◦ Rinse slides in distilled water to stop reaction.
6. Counterstaining:
◦ Counterstain with hematoxylin for 3 minutes.
◦ Rinse in running tap water followed by distilled water.
7. Dehydration and Mounting:
◦ Dehydrate through increasing ethanol concentrations (70%,
95%, and 100%) for 2 minutes each, followed by xylene (3 x
5 minutes).
◦ Apply coverslip using mounting medium.
C) Quality Control:
1. Include positive control slides in each batch.
2. Assess staining quality of control slides before interpreting
patient samples.
3. Document staining procedure including date, technologist
initials, and any deviations from protocol.
4. RESULTS INTERPRETATION
Technical component involves solely the preparation of stained
slides. The interpretation of stained slides is performed by a qualified
pathologist not covered by this SOP.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
After preparation, labeled and stained slides along with control slides
should be handed over to the pathologist for interpretation. Document
the completion of staining and any observations related to staining
quality or procedural deviations.
1. REFERENCE MATERIALS:
• Manufacturer’s recommendations for antibody dilution and
incubation.
• Peer-reviewed literature on optimal methodologies for CD123
immunostaining.
• Internal quality control logs for each batch.
1. Method Limitations:
Refer to manufacturer’s guidelines for antibody specificity and
limitations.
References:
• Manufacturer’s CD123 antibody product insert.
• Peer-reviewed literature on CD123 staining and validation
strategies.
Approval: This SOP is reviewed and approved by the laboratory
supervisor and quality assurance officer.
Revisions: Document any changes or updates to the protocol with
the revision number and date.
By following this SOP, laboratory personnel will ensure robust and
reproducible CD123 staining for diagnostic purposes with due
diligence to quality control and documentation standards.
