Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
CD138 (Syndecan) Immunostain, Technical Component Only
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to outline the steps for the technical
component of processing and staining tissue samples using the
CD138 (Syndecan) immunostain protocol. The CD138 immunostain
is used to detect plasma cells in bone marrow specimens and other
tissues for diagnostic evaluation.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of the trained laboratory personnel to follow this
procedure accurately to ensure optimal staining quality and
preservation of tissue morphology. The laboratory supervisor is
responsible for the proper training of personnel and the oversight of
the staining procedures.

20. PROCEDURE
A. Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
1. Place slides with FFPE tissue sections in a 60°C oven for 20
minutes.
2. Immerse slides in xylene for 3 minutes, repeat with fresh
xylene.
3. Rehydrate tissue sections by sequentially immersing slides in
ethanol solutions: 100%, 95%, 80%, and 70%, for 3 minutes
each.
4. Rinse sections in running tap water.
B. Antigen Retrieval:
1. Immerse slides in antigen retrieval solution within a microwave-
safe container.
2. Microwave for 10-15 minutes, ensuring the solution remains hot
but does not boil.
3. Allow slides to cool for 20 minutes at room temperature.
4. Rinse slides in PBS for 5 minutes.
C. Blocking Non-specific Binding:
1. Apply blocking solution (e.g., 5% BSA or normal serum) to the
sections and incubate in a humidity chamber for 10 minutes at
room temperature.
2. Tap off excess blocking solution. Do not rinse.
D. Primary Antibody Incubation:
1. Apply diluted CD138 primary antibody to each section.
2. Incubate in a humidity chamber for 1 hour at room temperature
or overnight at 4°C.
3. Wash slides in PBS for 5 minutes, change PBS, and wash for
an additional 5 minutes.
E. Secondary Antibody and Detection:
1. Apply secondary antibody polymer detection system to sections
and incubate for 30 minutes at room temperature.
2. Wash slides in PBS for 5 minutes, change PBS, and wash for
an additional 5 minutes.
3. Apply DAB substrate to each section and incubate for 5-10
minutes or until desired staining intensity is observed.
4. Wash slides in running tap water for 5 minutes.
F. Counterstaining:
1. Immerse slides in hematoxylin for 1 minute.
2. Wash slides in running tap water until clear.
3. Dip slides in 70%, 80%, 95%, and 100% ethanol solutions
sequentially for de-staining and dehydration.
G. Clearing and Mounting:
1. Immerse slides in xylene for 3 minutes, repeat with fresh
xylene.
2. Apply mounting medium and cover slip.
3. QUALITY CONTROL
4. Positive Control: Include a known positive control slide to
ensure staining effectiveness.
5. Negative Control: Include a negative control slide (omit primary
antibody) to check for non-specific staining.
6. Document staining quality of controls and run daily for quality
assurance.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
8. Ensure clear documentation in the laboratory information
system (LIS).
9. Record observations for technical validation, including any
anomalies.
10. LIMITATIONS
11. Over- or under-incubation with antibodies can affect staining
intensity and specificity.
12. Proper tissue fixation and sectioning is crucial for reliable
results. Poorly fixed or fragmented sections may yield
suboptimal staining results.
13. Always perform within the manufacturer's guidelines for
reagents and equipment.
