Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical
Phase of Generating Results for CD13 Immunostain,
Technical Component Only
1. PURPOSE
To describe the procedure for the technical component of CD13
immunostaining in tissue samples, ensuring consistent and accurate
results for diagnostic purposes.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all personnel involved in the preparation
and processing of tissue samples for CD13 immunostaining at the
laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the trained laboratory technologists to follow
this SOP accurately. The laboratory supervisor is responsible for
overseeing the adherence to this SOP and addressing any deviations
or issues.
4. MATERIALS
• Tissue samples (pre-fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin,
paraffin-embedded)
• Microtome
• Positive control slides for CD13
• xylene
• Ethanol (100%, 95%, 70%)
• Distilled water
• Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)
• Heat-induced epitope retrieval (HIER) solution (e.g., citrate buffer
or EDTA solution)
• Peroxidase block solution
• CD13 primary antibody
• Secondary antibody-enzyme conjugate (e.g., HRP-conjugated
secondary antibody)
• DAB substrate solution
• Hematoxylin counterstain
• Mounting medium
• Coverslips
• Staining rack
• Humidity chamber
5. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation of Tissue Sections
1. Section Cutting
◦ Cut tissue sections at 4 µm thickness using a rotary
microtome.
◦ Float sections in a water bath set at 40-45°C.
◦ Mount sections onto charged glass slides.
◦ Bake slides at 60°C for 60 minutes to ensure complete
adherence.
B) Deparaffinization and Rehydration
1. Deparaffinization and Rehydration
◦ Deparaffinize slides in xylene for 2 changes, 10 minutes
each.
◦ Rehydrate through graded ethanol (100%, 95%, 70%) for 5
minutes each.
◦ Rinse slides in distilled water for 2 minutes.
C) Antigen Retrieval
1. Heat-Induced Epitope Retrieval (HIER)
◦ Immerse slides in the HIER solution (prepared as per
manufacturer's instructions).
◦ Perform heat retrieval using a microwave, pressure cooker,
or water bath at 95-100°C for 20 minutes.
◦ Allow slides to cool for 20 minutes at room temperature.
◦ Rinse slides in PBS for 5 minutes, 3 changes.
D) Immunostaining Procedure
1. Blocking Endogenous Peroxidase Activity
◦ Incubate slides in peroxidase block solution for 10 minutes.
◦ Rinse slides in PBS for 5 minutes, 2 changes.
2. Primary Antibody Incubation
◦ Apply CD13 primary antibody to each slide, ensuring
complete coverage of the tissue section.
◦ Incubate slides in a humidity chamber for 60 minutes at
room temperature.
◦ Rinse slides in PBS for 5 minutes, 3 changes.
3. Secondary Antibody and Detection
◦ Apply secondary antibody-enzyme conjugate to each slide.
◦ Incubate slides in a humidity chamber for 30 minutes at
room temperature.
◦ Rinse slides in PBS for 5 minutes, 3 changes.
4. DAB Substrate Development
◦ Apply DAB substrate solution to each slide and monitor for
color development (generally 1-5 minutes).
◦ Stop the reaction by rinsing slides in distilled water.
5. Counterstaining
◦ Counterstain slides with hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes.
◦ Rinse slides in running tap water until water runs clear.
◦ Dip slides in 1% ammonium hydroxide solution for bluing.
6. Dehydration and Mounting
◦ Dehydrate slides through graded ethanol solutions (70%,
95%, 100%, 100%) for 2 minutes each.
◦ Clear slides in xylene for 2 changes, 5 minutes each.
◦ Mount coverslips using a permanent mounting medium.
E) Quality Control and Documentation
1. Quality Control
◦ Include a positive control slide with known CD13-positive
tissue with each batch.
◦ Compare staining intensity and pattern with the positive
control to ensure assay validity.
2. Documentation
◦ Record each step, including reagent lot numbers, incubation
times, and any deviations from protocol.
◦ Ensure all results are reviewed and verified by the
supervising pathologist or technologist.
6. TROUBLESHOOTING
• Weak staining: Repeat staining with longer primary antibody
incubation or check antibody concentration.
• Non-specific staining: Ensure thorough washing steps and
consider increasing blocking time.
• No staining: Verify reagent expiration dates, antibody activity, and
proper antigen retrieval.
7. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's instructions for primary and secondary antibodies.
• Laboratory internal quality control guidelines.
• Relevant peer-reviewed literature on CD13
immunohistochemistry.
