Standard Operating Procedure: CD14 Immunostain – Technical
Component Only
1. Purpose: To outline the standardized procedure for the
technical preparation of CD14 immunostaining, ensuring high-
quality, reproducible results in the assessment of tissue
samples.
2. Scope: This SOP is intended for use by trained laboratory
personnel in the Histology department responsible for
performing technical components of immunohistochemistry
(IHC) staining for detecting CD14 markers in tissue specimens.
3. Responsibility: It is the responsibility of all designated
laboratory personnel to follow this protocol accurately and
consistently. The laboratory manager or supervisor must ensure
that all personnel are adequately trained and proficient in
performing this procedure.
4. Definitions: CD14 – A co-receptor for the detection of bacterial
lipopolysaccharide, present on the surface of many cells,
including macrophages and monocytes. It is an important
marker in immunohistochemistry for identifying cells of the
monocyte-macrophage lineage.
5. Specimen Requirements:
• Preferred specimens: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE)
tissue blocks.
• Unacceptable specimens: Specimens fixed in suboptimal fixatives
or with insufficient time in fixative, which may affect antigenicity.
1. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies:
• Microtome
• Water bath
• Positive charged glass slides
• Xylene
• Ethanol (100%, 95%, 80%)
• Distilled water
• Heat-induced epitope retrieval (HIER) system
• CD14 primary antibody
• Secondary antibody
• Chromogen (e.g., DAB)
• Mounting medium
• Coverslips
• Hematoxylin for counterstaining
• Automated IHC stainer (if available)
• Quality control slides (known positive and negative controls)
1. Procedure: 7.1. Section Preparation:
◦ Cut 3-5 micron thick sections from the FFPE tissue block
using a microtome.
◦ Transfer sections onto positive charged glass slides.
◦ Dry sections at 60°C for 1 hour in a slide drying oven.
7.2. Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
• Deparaffinize slides by placing them in xylene for 2 changes, 5
minutes each.
• Hydrate slides through a graded series of ethanol solutions
(100%, 95%, 80%) for 2 minutes each.
• Rinse slides in distilled water for 2 minutes.
7.3. Heat-Induced Epitope Retrieval (HIER):
• Place slides in a retrieval solution (e.g., citrate buffer, pH 6.0; or
EDTA buffer, pH 8.0) and subject them to heat-induced epitope
retrieval by placing them in a pressure cooker or water bath at
95°C for 20 minutes.
• Allow slides to cool in the retrieval solution for 20 minutes at room
temperature.
• Rinse slides in distilled water followed by PBS buffer.
7.4. Blocking:
• Apply blocking serum to the tissue sections to prevent non-
specific binding. Incubate for 10 minutes at room temperature.
• Wash slides gently in PBS buffer.
7.5. Primary Antibody Incubation:
• Apply the CD14 primary antibody to the slides at the
manufacturer-recommended dilution.
• Incubate in a humidified chamber for 30-60 minutes at room
temperature or as per antibody datasheet instructions.
7.6. Washing:
• Wash slides gently in PBS buffer for 2 changes of 2 minutes each.
7.7. Secondary Antibody and Detection:
• Apply a suitable secondary antibody from the detection kit.
• Incubate slides for the recommended time period at room
temperature, typically 30 minutes.
• Wash slides in PBS buffer for 2 changes of 2 minutes each.
• Apply chromogen (e.g., DAB) and incubate for the recommended
period until the desired stain intensity is achieved.
• Rinse the slides in distilled water to stop the reaction.
7.8. Counterstaining:
• Counterstain the slides with hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes.
• Rinse slides in running tap water until the water runs clear.
• Dip slides briefly in an alcohol-acid bath if needed, followed by a
rinse in water.
7.9. Dehydration and Mounting:
• Dehydrate the slides through a series of ethanol solutions (80%,
95%, 100%) for 2 minutes each.
• Clear the slides in xylene for 2 changes of 3 minutes each.
• Mount the coverslips using an appropriate mounting medium.
1. Quality Control:
◦ Include known positive and negative control slides in each
staining run to ensure the accuracy and reproducibility of the
staining process.
◦ Review control slides before assessing patient slides to
confirm the appropriate reaction of reagents.
2. Reporting of Results:
◦ Technicians responsible for the technical preparation will not
interpret or report immunostain results.
◦ Prepared slides will be provided to pathologists for
interpretation and reporting.
3. Reference Range: The pathologist will determine and report
findings based on the criteria established for CD14
immunostaining in clinical settings.
4. Method Limitations: Refer to the primary CD14 antibody
datasheet and the detection kit insert for any specific limitations
and troubleshooting guidance.
5. References: Include references to the primary CD14 antibody
datasheet, detection kit insert, and any relevant peer-reviewed
articles or standard protocols used in the laboratory.
This SOP should be reviewed and updated regularly to ensure
compliance with current standards and guidelines. Ensure that all lab
personnel are familiar with the contents and trained accordingly.
