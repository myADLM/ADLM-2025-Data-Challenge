Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for CD15 Immunostain,
Technical Component Only
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the process for the technical component of
generating results for CD15 immunostain in the laboratory. This
includes the preparation of slides, the immunostaining procedure, the
documentation of steps, and ensuring the quality control for accurate
and reliable results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
• Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing
the immunostaining procedure as detailed in this SOP.
• Supervisors are responsible for verifying that the procedure is
followed correctly and ensuring that quality control measures are
in place and met.
3. SPECIMEN
Acceptable Specimens:
• Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue sections.
• Cytology specimens prepared on slides.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Unfixed, fresh tissue specimens.
• Inadequately fixed or improperly processed specimens.
4. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
• Microtome
• Water bath
• Hot plate
• CD15 primary antibody
• Secondary antibody (HRP-conjugated)
• DAB chromogen kit
• Hematoxylin counterstain
• Xylene, ethanol, distilled water
• Positive and negative control slides
• Microscope
• Humidity chamber
• Slide racks and staining jars
• Mounting medium and coverslips
5. PROCEDURE
A) Preparing Slides
1. Sectioning:
◦ Cut 3-4 μm sections of FFPE tissue blocks using a
microtome.
◦ Place sections in a warm water bath to flatten and then
transfer onto positively charged slides.
◦ Dry slides on a hot plate or in a 60°C oven for 30-60
minutes.
2. Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
◦ Place slides in xylene for 10 minutes (repeat twice) to
deparaffinize.
◦ Rehydrate slides through a graded series of ethanol (100%,
95%, 70%) for 3 minutes each.
◦ Rinse slides in distilled water for 3 minutes.
B) Antigen Retrieval
1. Heat-Induced Epitope Retrieval (HIER):
◦ Place slides in a suitable antigen retrieval buffer (e.g., citrate
buffer pH 6.0) and heat in a microwave or pressure cooker
as per manufacturer's instructions.
◦ Allow slides to cool down to room temperature.
◦ Rinse slides in tris-buffered saline (TBS) for 2 minutes.
C) Immunostaining Procedure
1. Blocking:
◦ Incubate slides with protein block (e.g., normal serum or
commercial blocking agent) for 5-10 minutes to reduce non-
specific binding.
2. Primary Antibody:
◦ Apply CD15 primary antibody to the slides and incubate in a
humidity chamber for 30-60 minutes at room temperature or
as indicated by the antibody manufacturer.
◦ Rinse slides in TBS for 2 minutes.
3. Secondary Antibody:
◦ Apply HRP-conjugated secondary antibody and incubate as
per manufacturer's recommendation in the humidity
chamber.
◦ Rinse slides in TBS for 2 minutes.
4. DAB Chromogen:
◦ Apply DAB chromogen solution to slides and monitor the
color development under the microscope. The development
time typically ranges from 2-10 minutes.
◦ Stop the reaction by rinsing slides in distilled water.
5. Counterstaining:
◦ Counterstain slides with hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes.
◦ Rinse slides in running tap water for 5 minutes until a blue
hue is achieved.
◦ Dehydrate slides through graded ethanol series (70%, 95%,
100%) for 2 minutes each.
◦ Clear slides in xylene for 2 minutes.
D) Mounting
1. Mounting and Coverslipping:
◦ Add a drop of mounting medium onto slides and place
coverslips.
◦ Allow slides to dry completely.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Positive Control:
◦ A known positive tissue control must be included with each
staining run to ensure the procedure is working correctly.
• Negative Control:
◦ A slide with no primary antibody (substituted with buffer)
included to check for non-specific staining.
7. DOCUMENTATION AND REPORTING
• Record the batch number and expiry dates of all reagents and
antibodies used.
• Document any deviations from the SOP and corrective actions
taken.
• Review slides under the microscope for expected staining
patterns.
• Technical-only reports should include details on the quality of
staining and any issues observed.

• Manufacturer's instructions for antibodies and reagents.

This SOP must be reviewed and updated annually or when
necessary by laboratory management.
