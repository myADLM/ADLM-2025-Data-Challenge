Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for CD163 Immunostain
(Technical Component Only)
1. PURPOSE
To delineate the technical procedures for performing CD163
immunostaining on histological or cytological specimens in
order to ensure precise and reproducible results across tests.
This SOP covers the steps from specimen preparation through
the generation of stained slides but does not include diagnostic
interpretation.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all medical laboratory scientists performing
CD163 immunostaining in a CLIA-certified laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of trained laboratory personnel to:
◦ Prepare the specimens according to the guidelines.
◦ Perform the CD163 immunostaining procedure.
◦ Ensure quality control procedures are followed.
◦ Maintain accurate records and documentation.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
◦ Acceptable Specimens: • Formalin-fixed, paraffin-
embedded (FFPE) tissue samples. • Cytology smears fixed
with alcohol-based fixatives.
◦ Unacceptable Specimens: • Unfixed or inappropriately
fixed tissues. • Autolytic, necrotic, or poorly preserved
tissues.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
◦ Equipment: • Microtome • Water bath • Hot plate or slide
warmer • Staining racks and Coplin jars • Automated or
manual immunostainer • Microscope for quality check
◦ Reagents: • Primary antibody: anti-CD163 (clones/
specifications as per manufacturer) • Secondary antibody/
enzyme conjugate • Chromogen substrate (e.g., DAB) •
Counterstain (e.g., Hematoxylin) • Washing buffers (e.g.,
PBS) • Blocking reagents (e.g., serum or protein block)
◦ Supplies: • Slides and cover slips • Mounting medium •
Disposable gloves and lab coats • Absorbent pads • Distilled
water
6. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Preparation:
1. Section the FFPE tissue block at 4-5 µm thickness using
a microtome.
2. Float sections on a water bath at approximately 45°C.
3. Mount sections onto positively charged microscope slides.
4. Dry slides on a hot plate or slide warmer at 60°C for at
least 1 hour.
B. Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
1. Deparaffinize slides in xylene or an equivalent clearing
agent: 2 changes, 5 minutes each.
2. Hydrate slides through graded alcohols: • 100% ethanol: 2
changes, 3 minutes each. • 95% ethanol: 1 change, 3
minutes. • 70% ethanol: 1 change, 3 minutes.
3. Rinse slides in distilled water.
C. Antigen Retrieval:
◦ Perform antigen retrieval using appropriate methods (e.g.,
heat-induced epitope retrieval in citrate buffer, pH 6.0) as
per the primary antibody manufacturer’s guidelines.
◦ Allow slides to cool at room temperature and wash in PBS.
D. Immunostaining:
1. Block endogenous peroxidase activity by incubating with
3% hydrogen peroxide in PBS for 10 minutes.
2. Apply blocking reagent to prevent non-specific binding,
incubate for 10 minutes.
3. Incubate slides with primary anti-CD163 antibody diluted
in appropriate buffer for the recommended duration and
temperature (usually 30-60 minutes at room temperature).
4. Wash slides in PBS, 3 changes, 5 minutes each.
5. Apply secondary antibody/enzyme conjugate according to
manufacturer recommendations, incubate for specified
time.
6. Wash slides in PBS, 3 changes, 5 minutes each.
7. Apply chromogen substrate (e.g., DAB) until desired
staining intensity develops (generally for 3-10 minutes
while observing under a microscope).
8. Rinse slides in distilled water.
E. Counterstaining and Mounting:
1. Counterstain with Hematoxylin for 30 seconds to 1
minute.
2. Rinse slides in tap water and then distilled water.
3. Dehydrate through graded alcohols (70%, 95%, and
100% ethanol, 3 changes).
4. Clear in xylene or equivalent clearing agent, 2 changes, 5
minutes each.
5. Mount coverslips with a permanent mounting medium.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Run positive control slides with every batch of CD163
immunostains.
◦ Include negative control slides where the primary antibody is
omitted.
◦ Document all observations and any deviations from
protocol.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ Label stained slides appropriately with case number, block,
and slide identifiers.
◦ Conduct a quality assurance check using a microscope
before submitting slides for pathologist review and
diagnostic interpretation.
◦ Document the technical component.
9. REFERENCE INTERVALS
◦ Interpretation of the staining pattern and intensity is the
responsibility of the pathologist and is not included in this
SOP.

protocols.
This SOP ensures that the technical procedures for CD163
immunostaining are performed consistently and efficiently,
guaranteeing reliable and accurate results for clinical examination.
