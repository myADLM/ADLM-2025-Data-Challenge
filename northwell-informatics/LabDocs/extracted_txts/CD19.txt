Standard Operating Procedure: CD19 Analysis and Result
Generation
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is to
outline the procedures for the analytical phase of generating results
for CD19. CD19 testing is used to assess the presence and
frequency of CD19-positive B-cells in patient samples. This
procedure ensures accurate, reliable, and reproducible results.
Responsibility:
Designated medical laboratory scientists are responsible for
performing the CD19 analysis and generating results as defined in
this procedure. It is the responsibility of all staff to ensure that the
protocol is followed precisely and to bring any deviations or issues to
the attention of a supervisor.
1. DEFINITION
CD19 is a protein located on the surface of B-cells and is commonly
used as a marker in flow cytometry to identify B-cells in various
clinical conditions.
1. PROCEDURE
A) Sample Preparation
1. Confirm that the sample has been collected, received, and
accessioned correctly.
2. Ensure that the sample (peripheral blood, bone marrow, or
other) is appropriately labeled and meets acceptance criteria.
3. Mix the sample gently by inversion to ensure a homogeneous
cell suspension.
B) Reagent Preparation
1. Prepare reagents required for CD19 staining, including
fluorochrome-conjugated anti-CD19 antibodies.
2. Calibrate and validate all necessary reagents and record lot
numbers to ensure traceability.
C) Flow Cytometry Staining Protocol
1. Aliquot 100 µL of the sample into a flow cytometry tube or plate
well.
2. Add the recommended volume of fluorochrome-conjugated
anti-CD19 antibody to the sample.
3. Mix the sample gently by tapping or vortexing briefly.
4. Incubate the sample for 15-30 minutes at room temperature or
as specified by the antibody manufacturer, protected from light.
D) Cell Washing and Reagent Removal
1. Add 2 mL of appropriate buffer (e.g., phosphate-buffered saline
with 2% bovine serum albumin) to each tube.
2. Centrifuge samples at 500 x g for 5 minutes.
3. Discard the supernatant by careful decanting or aspiration,
retaining the cell pellet.
4. Repeat the wash step twice more to ensure the removal of
excess unbound antibodies.
E) Acquisition Setup and Calibration
1. Power on the flow cytometer and perform daily instrument
startup and calibration procedures.
2. Run quality control (QC) beads or a known control sample to
ensure the flow cytometer is performing optimally.
3. Set up the acquisition template, defining parameters for forward
scatter (FSC), side scatter (SSC), and the CD19-specific
fluorochrome.
4. Verify and adjust voltage and compensation settings if
necessary.
F) Sample Acquisition and Data Analysis
1. Place the stained sample tube into the flow cytometer.
2. Acquire a sufficient number of events (typically 10,000 to
100,000) to ensure statistical reliability.
3. Save and export the data files for subsequent analysis.
G) Data Analysis
1. Open the data files in the appropriate flow cytometry analysis
software.
2. Create a gating strategy to identify and quantify the CD19-
positive cell population.
3. Record the percentage and absolute count (if applicable) of
CD19-positive cells.
4. Verify that the analysis is consistent with expected controls and
standards.
H) Quality Control and Validation
1. Include positive and negative controls in each assay run to
validate the staining and analysis procedure.
2. Review and document all QC results to confirm that they are
within acceptable limits.
3. In case of QC failure, identify the root cause, re-run the affected
samples, and document corrective actions.
4. REPORTING RESULTS
5. Enter the acquired CD19 results into the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
6. Ensure the results are reviewed and verified by a trained
technologist or supervisor.
7. Report any critical or unexpected findings promptly to the
appropriate medical personnel.
8. SAMPLE INTEGRITY
9. If sample integrity is in question (e.g., hemolysis, clots), perform
an additional examination and determine the usability of the
sample.
10. If the sample is deemed unusable, notify the appropriate parties
and request a repeat sample if necessary.
11. DOCUMENTATION
12. Maintain comprehensive records for all procedures, including
sample preparation, reagent lot numbers, QC results, and data
analysis.
13. Ensure that all documentation is stored securely and is
accessible for audit or review.

cytometer user manuals for additional information on limitations,
troubleshooting, and detailed procedures.
This SOP is effective as of October 2023 and is to be reviewed and
updated annually or as necessary based on procedural changes.
