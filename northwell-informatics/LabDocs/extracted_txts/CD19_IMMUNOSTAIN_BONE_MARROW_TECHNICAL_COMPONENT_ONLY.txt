Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for CD19 Immunostain,
Bone Marrow, Technical Component Only
1. PURPOSE
This SOP details the process of performing CD19
immunohistochemical (IHC) staining on bone marrow samples for the
technical component only. This procedure ensures consistent and
accurate preparation, staining, and analysis of bone marrow samples
to identify the presence of CD19-positive cells.
Responsibility:
• Designated staff are responsible for performing the CD19
immunostain following this procedure.
• Supervisors must ensure that all staff adhere to the SOP and
address any deviations or issues.
1. MATERIALS AND REAGENTS
Equipment:
• Microtome
• Water bath set at 37-42°C
• IHC staining platform (e.g., automated stainer or manual system)
• Light microscope
Reagents:
• Primary antibody: Anti-CD19
• Secondary antibody conjugated with enzyme label (e.g., HRP)
• Detection system (e.g., DAB chromogen)
• Hematoxylin (counterstain)
• Mounting medium
• Positive control tissue
• Negative control (reagent without primary antibody)
Supplies:
• Histological slides
• Cover slips
• Absorbent wipes
• Forceps
• Slide racks
1. SPECIMEN HANDLING AND PREPARATION
a. Specimen Requirements:
• Accept fresh bone marrow biopsy samples fixed in neutral
buffered formalin or paraffin-embedded tissue blocks.
b. Sectioning:
• Cut 3-4 µm sections from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded
(FFPE) bone marrow tissue blocks using a microtome.
• Float sections on a water bath and mount on histological slides.
• Air dry slides and bake in an oven at 60°C for 1 hour.
1. IMMUNOSTAINING PROCEDURE
a. Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
• Deparaffinize slides in xylene for 3x5 min.
• Rehydrate through graded alcohols (100%, 95%, 70%) for 2x5
min each.
• Rinse slides in distilled water.
b. Antigen Retrieval:
• Perform heat-induced antigen retrieval using citrate buffer (pH
6.0) or EDTA buffer (pH 9.0) in a microwave or pressure cooker
for 20 minutes.
• Allow slides to cool for 20 minutes and rinse in distilled water.
c. Blocking:
• Incubate slides with a protein blocking reagent (e.g., normal goat
serum) for 10 minutes to reduce non-specific binding.
• Drain but do not rinse.
d. Primary Antibody Incubation:
• Apply primary anti-CD19 antibody to the tissue sections and
incubate according to manufacturer’s instructions (typically 30-60
minutes at room temperature or overnight at 4°C).
• Rinse slides in PBS or TBS (tris-buffered saline).
e. Secondary Antibody and Detection:
• Apply secondary antibody and incubate according to
manufacturer’s instructions.
• Rinse in PBS or TBS.
• Apply detection reagent (e.g., DAB chromogen), incubate until
desired staining is achieved, and rinse in tap water.
f. Counterstaining:
• Stain slides with hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes.
• Rinse in tap water and proceed with bluing in ammonia water for
1-2 minutes.
g. Dehydration and Mounting:
• Dehydrate slides through graded alcohols (70%, 95%, 100%).
• Clear in xylene for 3x5 min.
• Mount with coverslips using permanent mounting medium.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include known CD19-positive tissue as a positive control on each
staining run.
• Include a negative control by omitting the primary antibody on a
test slide.
• Inspect control tissues to ensure proper staining technique and
reagent function prior to analyzing patient samples.
• Document all QC results in the corresponding log book.
1. RESULT INTERPRETATION
• Examine stained slides under a light microscope.
• Verify expected staining patterns in the positive and negative
controls before assessing patient samples.
• Interpret and document the presence and distribution of CD19-
positive cells by a qualified pathologist or technologist.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Record all observations and findings.
• Ensure results are reviewed and verified by a senior technologist
or pathologist before reporting.
• Document any deviations or issues encountered during the
process.

protocols.

compliance with current standards and practices. Any deviations
should be documented and reviewed by laboratory management.
