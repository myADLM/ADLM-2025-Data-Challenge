Standard Operating Procedure: CD19 Immunostain, Technical
Component Only
1. PURPOSE
This procedure outlines the technical steps required for performing
immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining for CD19 on tissue sections.
The aim is to ensure consistency and accuracy in the technical
processing of specimens to facilitate diagnostic interpretation by a
pathologist.
Responsibility:
• Laboratory technologists are responsible for performing and
documenting all staining procedures according to this SOP.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring compliance with this
SOP and addressing any technical issues that arise.
2. SPECIMEN
Specimen Requirements:
• Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks.
• Tissue sections of 4-5 microns in thickness mounted on positively
charged slides.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Microtome
• Water bath
• Slide drying oven
• Staining racks
• Humid chamber
• Microscope
Reagents and Supplies:
• Xylene and Ethanol (various grades)
• Distilled water
• Antigen retrieval buffer (e.g., citrate buffer, pH 6.0)
• Peroxidase blocking reagent
• Protein blocking serum
• Primary antibody: Anti-CD19 (clone and dilution as specified by
the manufacturer)
• Secondary antibody (e.g., biotinylated secondary antibody)
• Detection system (e.g., avidin-biotin complex (ABC) with
chromogen such as DAB)
• Hematoxylin for counterstaining
• Mounting medium and coverslips
4. PROCEDURE
4.1. Preparation of Tissue Sections
1. Sectioning:
◦ Cut 4-5 micron tissue sections from FFPE tissue blocks
using a microtome.
◦ Float sections on a water bath at 40-45°C and pick up onto
positively charged slides.
◦ Dry slides in a drying oven at 60°C for at least 1 hour.
2. Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
◦ Deparaffinize sections by immersing slides in 3 changes of
xylene for 5 minutes each.
◦ Rehydrate sections through a series of graded ethanol
(100%, 95%, 80%, 70%) for 3 minutes each.
◦ Rinse slides gently with distilled water.
4.2. Antigen Retrieval:
1. Heat-Induced Epitope Retrieval (HIER):
◦ Immerse slides in antigen retrieval buffer (e.g., citrate buffer,
pH 6.0) and place in a preheated microwave or pressure
cooker.
◦ Microwave on high for 10-20 minutes or follow the pressure
cooker manufacturer's instructions.
◦ Allow slides to cool to room temperature in the buffer.
◦ Rinse slides with distilled water followed by TBS-T buffer
(Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20).
4.3. Immunostaining:
1. Blocking Endogenous Activity:
◦ Block endogenous peroxidase activity by immersing slides
in peroxidase blocking reagent for 10 minutes at room
temperature.
◦ Rinse slides with TBS-T buffer.
2. Blocking Non-Specific Binding:
◦ Apply protein blocking serum to sections and incubate for
15-30 minutes in a humid chamber.
◦ Remove excess blocking serum without rinsing.
3. Primary Antibody Incubation:
◦ Apply primary anti-CD19 antibody to each section. (Dilution
and incubation time as specified by the manufacturer,
typically 1:100 dilution for 1 hour at room temperature or
overnight at 4°C).
◦ Rinse slides with TBS-T buffer.
4. Secondary Antibody Incubation:
◦ Apply secondary biotinylated antibody to sections and
incubate for 30 minutes at room temperature.
◦ Rinse slides with TBS-T buffer.
5. Detection:
◦ Apply the avidin-biotin complex (ABC) reagent to sections
and incubate for 30 minutes at room temperature.
◦ Rinse slides with TBS-T buffer.
◦ Apply DAB chromogen solution and incubate until desired
stain intensity develops (typically 5-10 minutes).
◦ Rinse slides with tap water.
6. Counterstaining:
◦ Counterstain sections with hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes.
◦ Rinse slides in running tap water until clear.
◦ Dehydrate sections through graded ethanol (70%, 80%,
95%, 100%).
◦ Clear sections in xylene.
4.4. Mounting:
1. Mounting:
◦ Apply mounting medium and cover slips to the stained
sections.
◦ Allow slides to dry completely.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
Internal Quality Control:
1. Include a positive control slide (tissue known to express CD19)
and a negative control slide (no primary antibody) with each
batch of slides stained.
2. Verify staining intensity and specificity in positive control.
3. Ensure no staining in negative control.
6. REPORTING AND REVIEWING RESULTS
1. Stained slides are to be reviewed by a qualified pathologist who
will interpret and report the results.
2. Technologists must document all staining procedures, including
slide identifiers, reagent lot numbers, incubation times, and any
deviations from the protocol.
