STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES (SOPs)
TITLE: Analytical Phase for CD1A Immunostain, Technical
Component Only
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedures and responsibilities for conducting the
technical component of generating results for CD1A immunostaining
in a CLIA-certified laboratory.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
This procedure is to be followed by all trained laboratory personnel
involved in the technical aspects of immunohistochemical staining
(IHC) for CD1A. It is the responsibility of the lab supervisor to ensure
compliance with this SOP and address any deviations or issues.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE)
tissue sections preferred.
• Specimen Handling: Specimens must be handled with care to
avoid contamination or damage.
• Tissue Section Preparation: Cut sections to a thickness of 4-5
μm and mount on positively charged slides.
4. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
Equipment:
• Microtome
• Slide warmer
• Automated stainer (if available)
• Humidity chamber (if manual staining is done)
• Light microscope
Reagents:
• Primary antibody: Anti-human CD1A antibody
• Secondary antibody: Appropriate detection system (e.g., HRP-
conjugated or biotinylated secondary antibody)
• Enzyme substrate/chromogen (e.g., DAB)
• Positive and negative control tissues
• Antigen retrieval solution (e.g., citrate buffer, pH 6.0)
• Blocking solution (e.g., serum or commercial blocker)
• Counterstain (e.g., hematoxylin)
• Mounting medium
5. PROCEDURE
A) Slide Preparation:
1. Deparaffinization:
◦ Preheat slides on a slide warmer at 60°C for 1 hour.
◦ Deparaffinize slides in three changes of xylene, 5 minutes
each.
◦ Rehydrate slides through graded alcohols (100%, 95%,
70%) for 5 minutes each.
◦ Rinse slides in distilled water.
2. Antigen Retrieval:
◦ Place slides in antigen retrieval solution and heat in a
steamer or microwave following manufacturer's instructions
(e.g., 15-20 minutes at 95-100°C).
◦ Allow slides to cool to room temperature and rinse in
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).
B) Immunostaining:
1. Blocking:
◦ Incubate slides with blocking solution for 15 minutes to
prevent non-specific binding.
2. Primary Antibody Incubation:
◦ Incubate sections with primary antibody (anti-CD1A) diluted
according to the manufacturer’s instructions in a humidity
chamber for 30-60 minutes at room temperature or
overnight at 4°C.
◦ Rinse slides in PBS.
3. Secondary Antibody Incubation:
◦ Apply the detection system (secondary antibody) as per the
manufacturer’s protocol.
◦ Rinse slides in PBS.
4. Chromogen Development:
◦ Apply enzyme substrate/chromogen and incubate until
desired staining intensity is achieved (typically 5-10
minutes).
◦ Rinse slides in distilled water.
C) Counterstaining and Mounting:
1. Incubate slides in hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes to counterstain
nuclei.
2. Rinse in running tap water followed by distilled water.
3. Dehydrate slides through graded alcohols and clear in xylene.
4. Mount coverslips with an appropriate mounting medium.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Control Slides:
◦ Include positive control tissue known to express CD1A and
negative control (primary antibody omitted) with each batch
of staining.
◦ Evaluate control slides to ensure proper staining quality.
2. Troubleshooting:
◦ If staining is suboptimal (non-specific or weak), review and
adjust protocol parameters.
◦ Ensure reagents are within expiry dates and stored per
manufacturer’s recommendations.
3. Documentation:
◦ Record all relevant details including specimen ID, date,
antibody lot numbers, incubation times, and any deviations
from the protocol in the laboratory log.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Technical Verification:
◦ Technologist reviews stained slides under a microscope for
staining quality.
◦ Only technically acceptable slides are forwarded for
pathologist interpretation.
◦ Document completion of the technical component and any
issues encountered.
2. Pathologist Review:
◦ Pathologist reviews and interprets the stained slides and
generates a report based on clinical findings.
