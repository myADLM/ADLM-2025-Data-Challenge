Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for CD20
Immunohistochemistry (IHC) Analysis
1. PURPOSE
To describe the procedure for performing CD20
Immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis to detect CD20 protein
expression in tissue specimens, ensuring consistent and accurate
results.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of all laboratory personnel to follow this protocol
when performing CD20 IHC analysis to ensure quality and
consistency in results. Supervisors must ensure that all personnel are
appropriately trained and competent in this procedure.
1. DEFINITION
CD20 is a B-lymphocyte surface molecule, and its detection is
essential in diagnosing and monitoring certain hematological
malignancies.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Acceptable Specimens:
• Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks.
• Collateral control tissue if required.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Inadequately fixed or processed tissues.
• Specimens without proper identification and documentation.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Microtome
• Water bath
• Forceps
• Slide rack
• Coplin jars
• IHC Staining Platform (e.g., Ventana BenchMark, Dako
Autostainer)
• Anti-CD20 primary antibody
• Secondary antibody and detection system
• Hematoxylin counterstain
• Mounting medium and coverslips
• Positive and negative control slides
1. PRE-PROCEDURE SETUP
A) Preparation of Tissue Sections:
1. Cut 4-5 µm thick sections from FFPE tissue blocks using a
microtome.
2. Float sections on a water bath (45-50°C) and mount onto
positively charged glass slides.
3. Bake slides at 60°C for 1 hour to ensure tissue adherence.
B) Reagent Preparation:
1. Verify the expiration date and lot numbers of all reagents.
2. Prepare the primary and secondary antibodies according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
3. PROCEDURE
A) Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
1. Deparaffinize tissue sections in xylene (3 changes, 5 minutes
each).
2. Rehydrate through graded alcohols (100%, 95%, 70%, and
50%) to distilled water.
B) Antigen Retrieval:
1. Perform heat-induced epitope retrieval (HIER) using
appropriate retrieval solution (e.g., Citrate buffer or EDTA
buffer).
2. Heat slides in a steamer or pressure cooker for 20 minutes and
allow to cool for 20 minutes.
3. Rinse slides in running distilled water.
C) Immunostaining:
1. Load slides onto the IHC staining platform.
2. Apply the primary anti-CD20 antibody and incubate as per the
manufacturer's recommended time and temperature.
3. Wash slides with buffer following incubation.
4. Apply the secondary antibody and detection system according
to the manufacturer's protocol.
5. Wash slides and counterstain with hematoxylin.
6. Rinse slides in running tap water and dehydrate through graded
alcohols to xylene.
7. Mount slides with mounting medium and coverslip.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
9. Include a positive control slide that shows expected staining.
10. Include a negative control slide processed without the primary
antibody.
11. Evaluate staining quality and intensity of both controls before
interpreting patient slides.
12. REPORTING RESULTS
13. Review and interpret stained slides using a microscope.
14. Document the presence and extent of CD20 staining in the
tissue.
15. Report the results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
according to site-specific guidelines.
16. Notify the requesting physician of any critical findings promptly.
17. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Positive CD20 Expression: Strong membranous staining of B-
lymphocytes.
• Negative CD20 Expression: No membranous staining observed.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
2. Refer to the manufacturer’s product insert for limitations of the
antibody used.
3. Variability in fixation and processing of tissue specimens may
affect staining quality.
4. Background staining may occur if endogenous biotin is not
adequately blocked.
5. REFERENCES
6. Manufacturer's insert for the anti-CD20 primary antibody.
7. Standard IHC technical manuals and guidelines.
This SOP should be reviewed and updated as necessary and at least
annually to incorporate any new methods, reagents, or changes in
regulatory guidelines.
