Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for CD200 (OX2) Immunostain – Technical
Component Only
1. PURPOSE This SOP outlines the analytical procedures for
generating technical results for CD200 (OX2) immunostain to
ensure the consistency, reliability, and integrity of results.
2. SCOPE This procedure applies to all CLIA-certified laboratory
personnel performing CD200 (OX2) immunostaining.
3. RESPONSIBILITY Laboratory technologists and supervisors
are responsible for performing and overseeing the execution of
this protocol. It is the responsibility of all laboratory staff to
follow this protocol meticulously and report any deviations to a
supervisor.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• Automated Immunostainer (e.g., Ventana BenchMark, Dako
Autostainer)
• CD200 (OX2) Primary Antibody
• Detection Kit compatible with chosen immunostainer
• Positive and Negative Control Tissues
• Xylene
• Graded Alcohols (100%, 95%, 70%)
• Distilled Water
• Pre-treatment solution (e.g., Citrate buffer, pH 6.0 or EDTA, pH
9.0)
• Hematoxylin/Eosin counterstain
• Mounting Media
• Coverslips
• Slides and Slide Labels
1. PROCEDURE
5.1 Quality Control
• Ensure all reagents and materials are within their expiration dates
and have been stored according to manufacturer’s instructions.
• Run known positive and negative control tissues with each batch
of patient samples to validate the staining process.
5.2 Slide Preparation
• Ensure the received tissue sections are properly fixed in formalin
and embedded in paraffin.
• Cut 4-5 micron thick sections from paraffin blocks and mount onto
positively charged slides.
• Label each slide with the appropriate patient identification and
case number.
5.3 Deparaffinization and Rehydration
• Heat slides at 60°C for 1 hour to melt paraffin.
• Deparaffinize slides by immersing in xylene for 3 minutes,
repeating in fresh xylene for another 3 minutes.
• Rehydrate slides using graded alcohols: 100% alcohol for 2
minutes, 95% alcohol for 2 minutes, and 70% alcohol for 2
minutes.
• Rinse slides in distilled water for 2 minutes.
5.4 Antigen Retrieval
• Place slides in a pre-treatment solution (Citrate buffer, pH 6.0 or
EDTA, pH 9.0 chosen method).
• Heat slides in a microwave or pressure cooker according to the
pre-treatment protocol to retrieve antigenicity.
• Allow slides to cool for 20 minutes at room temperature.
• Rinse slides in distilled water for 3 minutes.
5.5 Blocking Endogenous Peroxidase
• Immerse slides in 0.3% hydrogen peroxide in methanol for 10
minutes to block endogenous peroxidase activity.
• Rinse slides in distilled water for 3 minutes.
5.6 Primary Antibody Incubation
• Apply CD200 (OX2) primary antibody to the tissue sections using
a sufficient volume to cover the tissue completely.
• Incubate according to the manufacturer's recommended time and
temperature, typically at room temperature for 30-60 minutes.
5.7 Detection
• Follow the manufacturer's protocol of your detection kit for the
application of secondary antibody and any necessary
amplification steps.
• Incubate and rinse slides as detailed in the detection protocol
between each step.
• Apply chromogen and incubate until the desired staining intensity
is achieved, typically between 5-10 minutes.
• Rinse slides in distilled water to terminate the chromogen
reaction.
5.8 Counterstaining and Mounting
• Counterstain with hematoxylin for 30-60 seconds.
• Rinse in running tap water for 3 minutes.
• Dehydrate through graded alcohols and clear in xylene.
• Apply coverslip with appropriate mounting media.
1. VERIFICATION AND REVIEW
• Verify the quality of staining under a microscope with special
emphasis on control tissues.
• If controls are within acceptable range, proceed to issue results.
• Document any deviations, observations, or corrective actions
taken.
1. DOCUMENTATION
• Record all procedural steps in the appropriate logbook.
• Document the lot numbers of antibodies, reagents, control results,
and technical observations.
1. REFERENCES
• Follow the detailed product inserts and technical guidelines
provided by the manufacturer for the CD200 (OX2) primary
antibody and detection kits used.
1. SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS
• Follow standard laboratory safety protocols.
• Use personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves, lab
coat, and eye protection when handling chemicals and biological
specimens.
