Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase for CD20 Cell Expression Evaluation
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for analyzing, evaluating, and reporting
CD20 cell expression in designated specimens using flow cytometry.
1. SCOPE
This SOP is applicable to all laboratory staff trained in flow cytometry
and responsible for executing, documenting, and troubleshooting
CD20 cell expression evaluations in compliance with CLIA standards.
1. RESPONSIBILITIES
• Designated lab personnel trained in flow cytometry will perform
the analysis.
• All staff are responsible for ensuring the quality of test results,
documenting procedures, and notifying supervisors of any issues
or deviations from protocol.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
4.1 Acceptable Specimens:
• Peripheral blood collected in EDTA tubes.
• Bone marrow aspirates collected in EDTA tubes.
• Lymph node tissue, kept sterile and at appropriate temperatures.
4.2 Stability:
• Peripheral blood: Stable for up to 48 hours if kept at 2-8°C.
• Bone marrow: Stable for up to 48 hours if kept at 2-8°C.
• Lymph node tissue: Stable for up to 24 hours if kept at 2-8°C.
1. EQUIPMENT
• Flow Cytometer
• Centrifuge
• Vortex Mixer
• Pipettes and Pipette Tips
• Refrigerated Centrifuge
• Tube Rack
1. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• Anti-CD20 antibody (fluorochrome-conjugated)
• Isotype control antibody
• Flow cytometry staining buffer (PBS or other appropriate buffer)
• Red blood cell lysis buffer
• 1% paraformaldehyde or appropriate fixative
• Disposable culture tubes (12 x 75 mm)
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
1. QUALITY CONTROL
Quality control samples (positive and negative controls) must be run
with each batch of patient samples to ensure the validity of assay
results.
1. PROCEDURE
8.1 Sample Preparation:
• Verify specimen identity and acceptability.
• For peripheral blood and bone marrow aspirates, add 100 µL of
the sample to appropriate culture tubes.
• For lymph node tissue, prepare a single-cell suspension and add
100 µL to appropriate tubes.
8.2 Staining:
• Add 10 µL of the fluorochrome-conjugated anti-CD20 antibody to
each sample tube.
• Add 10 µL of isotype control antibody to control tubes.
• Mix gently by vortexing and incubate in the dark at room
temperature for 15-30 minutes.
8.3 Washing:
• Add 2 mL of staining buffer to each tube and centrifuge at 500 × g
for 5 minutes.
• Carefully discard the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in
2 mL of staining buffer. Repeat wash step if necessary.
8.4 Red Blood Cell Lysis (if required):
• Add 2 mL of red blood cell lysis buffer to each tube, mix gently,
and incubate at room temperature for 10 minutes.
• Centrifuge at 500 × g for 5 minutes and discard the supernatant.
• Resuspend the cell pellet in staining buffer.
8.5 Fixation:
• Add 500 µL of 1% paraformaldehyde to each tube to fix the cells.
• Incubate at room temperature for 15 minutes if desired for
analysis stability.
• After fixation, wash cells once with staining buffer and resuspend
in 500 µL of the same buffer.
8.6 Flow Cytometry Analysis:
• Calibrate the flow cytometer using standard calibration beads.
• Run the quality control samples first to verify instrument
performance.
• Analyze the stained samples using appropriate voltage and
compensation settings for detecting CD20 expression.
• Acquire a minimum of 10,000 events per sample.
8.7 Data Analysis:
• Utilize flow cytometry analysis software to analyze the acquired
data.
• Set the gates to distinguish CD20 positive cells from negative and
isotype control.
• Record the percentage of CD20 positive cells in each sample.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Review the results to ensure accuracy and integrity.
• Enter the results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Document the analysis, including any abnormal findings, under
the patient’s medical record.
• Ensure any critical results are communicated immediately to the
responsible healthcare provider according to established
guidelines.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Variability in specimen collection and handling may affect the
results.
• Proper sample preparation and antibody integrity are critical to
ensure reliable data.
• Red blood cell lysis should be thoroughly performed to avoid false
positivity.

1. DOCUMENTATION
• All procedures, quality control data, and results will be
documented in logbooks or electronic records specifically
designated for CD20 analysis.
