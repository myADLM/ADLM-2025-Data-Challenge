Standard Operating Procedure for CD20 Immunostain, Technical
Component Only
1. Purpose:
◦ To outline the procedure for the technical component of
CD20 immunostain, ensuring consistent and accurate
staining results in compliance with laboratory standards.
2. Scope:
◦ This procedure applies to all laboratory staff performing
CD20 immunostain in the histopathology/
immunohistochemistry section of the laboratory.
3. Responsibility:
◦ Qualified and trained laboratory technologists are
responsible for performing the CD20 immunostain according
to this SOP.
◦ Laboratory supervisors are responsible for ensuring
compliance with this procedure and addressing any
technical issues that arise.
4. Definitions:
◦ CD20: A cell surface marker commonly used to identify B
lymphocytes in tissue sections.
◦ Immunohistochemistry (IHC): A technique used to visualize
specific antigens in tissues by employing antigen-antibody
reactions.
5. Specimen Requirements:
◦ Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections.
◦ Specimens should be properly labeled with patient
identification and relevant clinical information.
6. Equipment and Reagents:
◦ Microtome
◦ Water bath
◦ Oven
◦ Staining racks
◦ CD20 primary antibody
◦ Detection system (e.g., polymer-based, HRP-conjugated)
◦ Antigen retrieval solution (e.g., citrate buffer, pH 6.0)
◦ DAB (3,3'-diaminobenzidine) substrate
◦ Counterstain (e.g., hematoxylin)
◦ Mounting medium
◦ Glass slides and coverslips
7. Procedure:
Slide Preparation:
◦ Section the paraffin-embedded tissue block at 3-5 microns
using a microtome.
◦ Place sections on positively charged glass slides and
incubate in a 60°C oven for 60 minutes to ensure adhesion.
Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
◦ Deparaffinize slides in xylene for 2 x 5 minutes.
◦ Rehydrate through a graded series of alcohols (100%, 95%,
70%) for 2 minutes each.
◦ Rinse in distilled water for 2 minutes.
Antigen Retrieval:
◦ Place slides in a heat-resistant container containing antigen
retrieval solution.
◦ Perform heat-induced antigen retrieval in a microwave or
pressure cooker as per manufacturer's instructions.
◦ Allow slides to cool to room temperature before rinsing in
distilled water.
Staining:
◦ Outline the tissue with a hydrophobic pen.
◦ Incubate the slides with CD20 primary antibody (dilution and
incubation time according to manufacturer’s instructions) in
a humidified chamber.
◦ Rinse slides in PBS or TBS buffer.
◦ Apply the detection system (polymer or HRP-conjugated
secondary antibody) and incubate as per manufacturer’s
instructions.
◦ Rinse slides in PBS or TBS buffer.
Chromogenic Detection:
◦ Incubate slides with DAB substrate until the desired staining
intensity is achieved (generally 2-5 minutes).
◦ Rinse in distilled water.
Counterstaining and Mounting:
◦ Counterstain with hematoxylin for 1 minute.
◦ Rinse in tap water until clear.
◦ Dehydrate through a series of alcohols (70%, 95%, 100%)
for 2 minutes each.
◦ Clear in xylene for 2 x 5 minutes.
◦ Mount with mounting medium and coverslip.
8. Quality Control:
◦ Include positive and negative control slides with each batch
of patient samples.
◦ Record control results and any deviations or corrective
actions taken.
◦ Verify staining quality with a pathologist or qualified
personnel.
9. Reporting Results:
◦ This SOP covers the technical component only. Stained
slides should be submitted to a pathologist for interpretation
and reporting.
10. Documentation:
◦ Ensure all steps, reagents, and incubation times are
documented in the laboratory logbook.
◦ Record any deviations from the protocol and corrective
actions taken.
11. References:
◦ Manufacturer’s instructions for CD20 primary antibody and
detection system.
◦ Laboratory quality control guidelines and procedures.
12. Method Limitations:
◦ False positives/negatives may occur due to improper tissue
fixation, non-specific binding, or technical errors.
Compliance with the procedure and proper controls are
essential to minimize these risks.
13. Safety Considerations:
◦ Use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) (e.g.,
gloves, lab coat, eye protection).
◦ Handle chemicals and biological specimens according to
laboratory safety protocols.
