Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical
Phase of Generating Results for CD20 on B Cells,
Blood
1. PURPOSE
This procedure outlines the steps to be taken to accurately analyze
and generate results for CD20 on B Cells from blood samples. This
analysis is crucial for the evaluation and monitoring of certain
hematological conditions, such as non-Hodgkin lymphomas and
certain leukemias.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel performing flow
cytometry analysis for the detection of CD20 on B Cells using blood
samples.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the designated trained laboratory personnel
to ensure the accurate and timely processing of blood samples for
CD20 analysis. All laboratory personnel must adhere to the
guidelines set forth in this SOP.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred Specimen:
◦ Peripheral blood collected in EDTA tubes.
◦ Aseptic collection is mandatory.
◦ Specimens should be processed within 24 hours of collection.
• Unacceptable Specimen:
◦ Hemolyzed samples
◦ Clotted samples
◦ Samples collected in non-EDTA tubes.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Flow Cytometer
• CD20 Monoclonal Antibody (fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-
conjugated)
• Lysis Buffer (ammonium chloride)
• PBS (Phosphate Buffered Saline)
• EDTA-anticoagulated whole blood
• 12 x 75 mm polystyrene test tubes
• Fixed and permeabilization reagents (if required)
• Control samples (e.g., known CD20-positive and CD20-negative
controls)
• Centrifuge
• Vortex mixer
6. PROCEDURE
6.1 Sample Preparation
1. Labeling:
◦ Label all test tubes clearly with patient identification and
date.
2. Cell Preparation:
◦ Aliquot 100 µL of EDTA-anticoagulated whole blood into a
labeled 12 x 75 mm polystyrene test tube.
◦ Add 10 µL of CD20 FITC-conjugated monoclonal antibody to
each tube.
3. Incubation:
◦ Vortex gently to mix and incubate for 15 minutes at room
temperature in the dark.
4. Lysis of Red Blood Cells:
◦ Add 2 mL of lysis buffer to each tube.
◦ Vortex gently and incubate for 10 minutes at room
temperature in the dark.
5. Washing:
◦ Centrifuge the tubes at 300 x g for 5 minutes.
◦ Discard the supernatant carefully.
◦ Resuspend the pellet in 2 mL of PBS and centrifuge again at
300 x g for 5 minutes.
◦ Discard the supernatant.
◦ Resuspend the cell pellet in 500 µL of PBS.
6. Flow Cytometry Setup:
◦ Calibrate the flow cytometer according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
◦ Use appropriate settings and compensation controls.
6.2 Analysis
1. Reading Samples:
◦ Analyze each sample on the flow cytometer.
◦ Run control samples before patient samples to ensure the
accuracy and consistency of the results.
2. Data Acquisition:
◦ Record at least 10,000 events per sample.
3. Data Analysis:
◦ Analyze the data using flow cytometry software.
◦ Identify the lymphocyte population based on forward and
side scatter properties.
◦ Gate on the CD20-positive B cell population.
◦ Record the percentage of CD20-positive cells in the
lymphocyte gate.
6.3 Quality Control
1. Control Samples:
◦ Include positive and negative control samples in each run.
◦ If controls are out of range, do not proceed with patient
sample analysis until the issue is resolved.
2. Maintenance:
◦ Perform routine maintenance on the flow cytometer as per
the manufacturer’s guidelines.
◦ Perform daily calibration and verification of the instrument’s
performance.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results should be reviewed and verified by a trained technologist.
• Report the percentage of CD20-positive cells in the lymphocyte
population.
• Document and communicate any critical findings immediately to
the supervising clinician.
8. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions for the flow cytometer.
• Relevant clinical guidelines and references on CD20 analysis in
hematological disorders.
9. ATTACHMENTS
• Flow Cytometry Calibration and Maintenance Logs
• CD20 Analysis Data Sheets
10. NOTES
• Ensure proper disposal of all biological materials and reagents as
per biohazard guidelines.
• Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) at all
times during the procedure.
By following this SOP, laboratory personnel will ensure the
standardization and accuracy of results for CD20 on B Cells from
blood samples.
