Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for CD21 Immunostain –
Technical Component Only
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for processing and staining paraffin-
embedded tissue sections with CD21 antibody for the
immunohistochemical evaluation of follicular dendritic cells.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all paraffin-embedded tissue sections
submitted for CD21 immunostaining in the laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
The laboratory technologists and histotechnicians are responsible for
performing the steps outlined in this protocol. It is the responsibility of
the supervisor to ensure that all staff are adequately trained.
4. MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT
• Paraffin-embedded tissue sections
• Positive and negative control tissue
• CD21 primary antibody
• Secondary antibody
• Detection system (e.g., HRP/DAB, AP/Red)
• Antigen retrieval solution (e.g., citrate buffer, pH 6.0)
• Xylene
• Ethanol (100%, 95%, 70%)
• Distilled water
• PBS (Phosphate Buffer Saline)
• Coverslips and mounting medium
• Immunohistochemistry staining platform (automated stainer or
manual setup)
• Incubator (37°C)
• Forceps, slide racks, and other necessary laboratory equipment
5. DEFINITIONS
• Primary Antibody: Monoclonal antibody specific for CD21.
• Secondary Antibody: Antibody conjugated to an enzyme,
typically horseradish peroxidase or alkaline phosphatase, that
binds to the primary antibody.
• DAB (Diaminobenzidine): A chromogen used for visualizing the
antibody-antigen reaction.
• Antigen Retrieval: A process to unmask antigenic sites in tissue
sections to allow binding of the primary antibody.
6. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation of Reagents and Equipment:
1. Ensure all reagents are at the required working concentration
and prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions.
2. Preheat the antigen retrieval solution to 95-100°C in a water
bath.
3. Pre-warm the incubator to 37°C.
B) Slide Preparation:
1. Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
◦ Place slides in xylene for 2 changes, 5 minutes each.
◦ Rehydrate through graded ethanol series:
▪ 100% ethanol for 3 minutes, 2 changes
▪ 95% ethanol for 3 minutes
▪ 70% ethanol for 2 minutes
▪ Rinse in distilled water for 2 minutes
2. Antigen Retrieval:
◦ Place slides in preheated antigen retrieval solution.
◦ Heat in a microwave or water bath at 95-100°C for 20
minutes.
◦ Allow slides to cool to room temperature (approximately 20
minutes).
◦ Wash slides in PBS for 5 minutes.
C) Immunostaining:
1. Blocking:
◦ Incubate slides with blocking solution (e.g., 10% normal
serum) for 10 minutes at room temperature to block non-
specific binding.
◦ Drain excess blocking solution without washing.
2. Primary Antibody Incubation:
◦ Apply CD21 primary antibody to the sections.
◦ Incubate at 37°C for 60 minutes or as per manufacturer's
instructions.
◦ Wash slides in PBS for 5 minutes, 3 changes.
3. Secondary Antibody Incubation:
◦ Apply secondary antibody to the sections.
◦ Incubate at room temperature for 30 minutes.
◦ Wash slides in PBS for 5 minutes, 3 changes.
4. Chromogen Development:
◦ Incubate slides with the DAB solution or other chromogen
as specified by the detection kit for 5-10 minutes until the
desired stain intensity is observed.
◦ Rinse slides in distilled water for 2 minutes.
◦ Counterstain with hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes.
◦ Rinse slides in running tap water for 5 minutes.
◦ Blue the sections in 0.2% ammonia water or Scott’s tap
water for 30 seconds.
◦ Rinse in distilled water.
D) Dehydration and Mounting:
1. Dehydrate through graded ethanol series:
◦ 70% ethanol for 2 minutes
◦ 95% ethanol for 2 minutes
◦ 100% ethanol for 2 minutes, 2 changes
2. Clear in xylene for 5 minutes, 2 changes.
3. Apply coverslip using mounting medium.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Include positive and negative control sections in each staining
run.
2. Verify staining intensity and localization in control tissue before
reporting the patient results.
8. TROUBLESHOOTING
1. Weak or absent staining:
◦ Check antibody concentrations and incubation times.
◦ Ensure proper antigen retrieval.
2. Non-specific staining:
◦ Verify blocking steps and secondary antibody specificity.
◦ Ensure adequate washing between steps.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
Technical staff reviews stained slides for quality and consistency
before passing them to the pathologist for interpretation. No patient
results should be released until quality controls are verified and
passed.
10. RECORD KEEPING
Document all reagent lot numbers, expiration dates, and any
deviations from the SOP. Maintain records of all staining runs,
including control outcomes.
