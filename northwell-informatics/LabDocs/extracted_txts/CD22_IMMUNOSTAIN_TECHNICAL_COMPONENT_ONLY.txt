Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for CD22 Immunostain,
Technical Component Only
1. PURPOSE
This SOP provides a detailed procedure for the technical component
of generating results for CD22 immunostaining in a CLIA-certified
laboratory. The procedure includes preparation, staining, quality
control, and documentation to ensure accurate and reproducible
results.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing and
documenting the CD22 immunostaining according to this procedure.
Supervisors are responsible for ensuring that the SOP is followed
and any issues are addressed promptly.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Tissue: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue blocks are
preferred.
• Slides: Cut sections at 4-5 microns thickness on charged slides.
• Specimen must be properly labeled with patient identification and
relevant clinical information.
3. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• Primary Antibody: Anti-CD22 monoclonal antibody.
• Buffer: Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4.
• Detection System: DAB (Diaminobenzidine) substrate kit.
• Counterstain: Hematoxylin.
• Mounting Medium: Aqueous or resin-based medium.
• Positive and Negative Control Slides.
• Coverslips.
• Glass slides.
• Slide racks.
4. EQUIPMENT
• Automatic Immunostainer or Manual Staining Setup.
• Microtome.
• Incubator at 37°C.
• Light microscope.
• Humidity chamber.
• Slide warmer.
• Timer.
5. PROCEDURE
Preparation of Slides
1. Ensure tissue blocks are properly trimmed and embedded.
2. Cut sections at 4-5 microns thickness using a microtome and
place them on charged glass slides.
3. Dry slides on a slide warmer at 58°C for 1 hour.
Deparaffinization and Rehydration
1. Immerse slides in xylene for 3 x 5 minutes.
2. Rehydrate slides through graded alcohols: 100%, 95%, and
70%, 2 x 3 minutes each.
Antigen Retrieval
1. Preheat antigen retrieval buffer (e.g., citrate buffer, pH 6.0) in a
microwave or pressure cooker.
2. Place slides in buffer solution and heat for 20 minutes.
3. Allow slides to cool for 20 minutes at room temperature.
Blocking Endogenous Peroxidase
1. Immerse slides in 0.3% hydrogen peroxide for 10 minutes.
2. Rinse slides in PBS.
Primary Antibody Application
1. Apply anti-CD22 monoclonal antibody to the sections.
2. Incubate in a humidity chamber at room temperature for 30-60
minutes.
3. Rinse slides in PBS, 3 x 5 minutes.
Detection System
1. Apply secondary antibody and incubate at room temperature
according to the manufacturer's instructions (usually 10-30
minutes).
2. Rinse slides in PBS, 3 x 5 minutes.
3. Apply DAB substrate solution and monitor the development
under a microscope. This generally takes 5-10 minutes.
4. Rinse slides in PBS.
Counterstaining
1. Immerse slides in hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes.
2. Rinse slides in running tap water for 5 minutes.
Dehydration and Mounting
1. Dehydrate slides through graded alcohols: 70%, 95%, 100%, 2
x 3 minutes each.
2. Clear slides in xylene, 3 x 5 minutes.
3. Apply mounting medium and coverslips.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
Positive Controls
Run a known positive control slide to ensure the staining procedure is
working correctly.
Negative Controls
Run a negative control slide (either omission of primary antibody or
use of an isotype-matched control) to check for non-specific binding.
Documentation
1. Document all procedural steps, including the batch number of
reagents and antibodies used.
2. Record the staining results and any observations in the
logbook.
3. Maintain a temperature log for all equipment used.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
The stained slides are reviewed under a microscope by a trained
pathologist or designated laboratory personnel. Results are
documented according to the laboratory's reporting guidelines.
Reference Intervals:
Refer to published literature or internal standards for interpretation of
CD22 staining patterns.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the primary antibody manufacturer's insert for specific
limitations related to antigen retrieval, sensitivity, and specificity.
References:
Include manufacturer's packet inserts and relevant scientific literature
for the anti-CD22 monoclonal antibody and detection system.
9. SAFETY AND TROUBLESHOOTING
1. Wear appropriate PPE including gloves, lab coat, and goggles.
2. Handle chemicals and reagents according to safety protocols.
3. In case of staining issues, troubleshoot by checking reagent
expiration, buffer pH, and incubation times.
This protocol must be reviewed and updated annually or when
changes in methodology are necessary.
