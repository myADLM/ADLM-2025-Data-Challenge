STANDARD OPERATING
PROCEDURE
TITLE: Analytical Phase of Generating
Results for CD23 Immunostain, Technical
Component Only
1. PURPOSE
To outline the standard operating procedure for processing and
generating results for CD23 immunostaining in the laboratory. This
will ensure consistency, reliability, and accuracy in the technical
component of the immunostaining process.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all designated laboratory personnel
performing CD23 immunostaining tests in a CLIA-certified laboratory
setting.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Laboratory Scientists/Technologists: Responsible for
performing the CD23 immunostaining as per this SOP.
• Supervisors/Managers: Responsible for ensuring compliance
with the SOP and providing training to the laboratory personnel.
4. DEFINITIONS
• CD23 Immunostain: A specialized immunohistochemical stain
used to identify the CD23 antigen, often used in the diagnosis of
certain hematopoietic malignancies.
• Technical Component: Refers to the preparation and staining of
the tissue samples without the interpretation of the results.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Automated immunostainer
• Microtome
• Water bath
• Slide warmer
• Microscope
Reagents:
• CD23 primary antibody
• Secondary antibody conjugated to enzyme
• Chromogen solution
• Positive and negative control slides
• Counterstain (e.g., hematoxylin)
Supplies:
• Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue sections
• Glass slides
• Coverslips
• Mounting medium
• Distilled water
• Buffer solutions (e.g., PBS)
6. PROCEDURE
Pre-Analytical Preparation
1. Tissue Sectioning:
◦ Sections of FFPE tissue should be cut at a thickness of 4-5
µm using a microtome.
◦ Place sections on positively charged slides and air dry.
2. Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
◦ Deparaffinize slides in xylene for 2 x 5 minutes.
◦ Rehydrate slides through a graded series of alcohol (100%,
95%, 70%) for 2 x 5 minutes each.
◦ Rinse slides in distilled water.
Analytical Phase
1. Antigen Retrieval:
◦ Use a retrieval solution (e.g., citrate buffer, pH 6.0) and heat
slides in a water bath or microwave for the specified time
(typically 20-30 minutes).
◦ Allow slides to cool in the retrieval solution for approximately
20 minutes.
◦ Rinse slides in distilled water followed by phosphate
buffered saline (PBS).
2. Blocking:
◦ Incubate slides with a blocking solution to prevent
nonspecific binding (e.g., 5% normal serum) for 20 minutes
at room temperature.
3. Primary Antibody Incubation:
◦ Incubate slides with CD23 primary antibody as per the
manufacturer's recommended dilution and incubation time
(typically 30-60 minutes at room temperature).
◦ Wash slides in PBS.
4. Secondary Antibody Incubation:
◦ Incubate slides with the secondary antibody conjugated to
an enzyme for 30 minutes at room temperature.
◦ Wash slides in PBS.
5. Chromogen Development:
◦ Apply chromogen solution to slides and incubate for the
recommended time to visualize the antibody-antigen binding
(typically 5-10 minutes, monitor development under the
microscope).
◦ Rinse slides thoroughly in distilled water to stop the
reaction.
6. Counterstaining:
◦ Dip slides in a counterstain solution (e.g., hematoxylin) for
1-2 minutes.
◦ Rinse slides in tap water and place in a bluing solution if
required.
7. Dehydration and Mounting:
◦ Dehydrate slides through a graded series of alcohol (70%,
95%, 100%) followed by xylene.
◦ Mount slides with a suitable mounting medium and cover
with coverslips.
Post-Analytical Phase
1. Quality Control:
◦ Examine control slides (positive and negative) to ensure
staining worked correctly.
◦ Document and report any issues or deviations from
expected results.
2. Documentation:
◦ All slides and procedures should be recorded in the
laboratory information system including any anomalies or
deviations.
◦ Ensure that all results are reviewed and validated by
supervisory personnel.
3. Storage:
◦ Properly store stained slides in a slide file at room
temperature for future reference and re-examination if
necessary.
