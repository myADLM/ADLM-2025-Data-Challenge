Protocol for the Analytical Phase of Generating CD25
Results
1. PURPOSE
To provide precise and accurate CD25 results using flow cytometry in
a clinical laboratory. This procedure outlines the steps necessary for
the analysis and generation of CD25 results, ensuring consistency,
accuracy, and adherence to laboratory standards.
2. SCOPE
This protocol applies to the handling and analysis of specimens that
require CD25 testing using flow cytometry.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory staff, including laboratory scientists and
technologists, are responsible for performing CD25 analysis,
documenting results, and reporting any deviations or issues to a
supervisor.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENT AND STABILITY
Specimen Types:
• Peripheral blood
• Bone marrow aspirate
Collection Tubes:
• EDTA (lavender top) for peripheral blood
• Heparinized tube for bone marrow
Specimen Stability:
• Peripheral blood: Analyze within 24 hours of collection when
stored at 2-8°C
• Bone marrow: Analyze within 24 hours of collection when stored
at 2-8°C
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Clotted samples
• Samples with inadequate volume
• Samples received in inappropriate containers
• Samples not labeled properly with collection time and patient
identification
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Flow cytometer
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes and associated tips
Reagents:
• Fluorescently-labeled anti-CD25 antibodies
• Lysing solution
• Fixative solution
• Isotype controls
Supplies:
• Tubes for staining (5 mL or 12 x 75 mm tubes)
• Parafilm
• Disposable gloves, lab coat, and other PPE
6. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation:
1. Mix the specimen thoroughly by gentle inversion.
2. For peripheral blood, pipette 100 µL of whole blood into each
tube for staining. For bone marrow, adjust the volume if
necessary.
3. Add the appropriate volume of fluorescently-labeled anti-CD25
antibody to each tube.
4. Include tubes for isotype controls using corresponding volumes.
5. Parafilm the tubes and incubate them protected from light for
15-30 minutes at room temperature.
6. After incubation, add 2 mL of lysing solution to each tube to lyse
red blood cells and mix gently.
7. Incubate for 10 minutes at room temperature protected from
light.
8. Centrifuge at 500g for 5 minutes and carefully aspirate the
supernatant without disturbing the pellet.
9. Resuspend the pellet in 2 mL of PBS or fixative solution.
10. Centrifuge at 500g for 5 minutes and aspirate the supernatant.
11. Resuspend the cells in 500 µL of PBS for flow cytometry
analysis.
B. Flow Cytometer Setup and Calibration:
1. Turn on the flow cytometer and allow it to warm up while
performing daily maintenance and calibration using calibration
beads.
2. Verify that the flow cytometer’s software parameters and
settings are optimal for detecting CD25 fluorescence.
3. Record acquisition parameters including:
◦ Sheath fluid pressure
◦ Laser settings
◦ Compensation
C. Acquisition and Analysis:
1. Run tubes containing the prepared samples on the flow
cytometer according to the manufacturer's instructions.
2. Collect at least 10,000 events per tube for adequate statistical
analysis.
3. Use consistent gating strategies to identify relevant cell
populations.
4. Analyze the data using flow cytometry analysis software to
determine CD25 expression.
5. Include negative controls, isotype controls, and known positive
controls to validate results.
D. Data Recording and Reporting:
1. Document all raw data and analysis results on standardized
reporting forms.
2. Verify accuracy and consistency with controls.
3. If results are outside the expected range, follow standard
troubleshooting procedures and notify the supervisor.
4. Enter validated results into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS) for review and verification by a senior technologist.
5. Report critical values as per laboratory policy and note any
potential interferences that may affect result interpretation.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
Internal Quality Control:
• Run QC samples with each batch of patient samples.
• Include positive and negative controls in every run.
• Verify QC results to be within acceptable ranges before reporting
patient results.
External Quality Control:
• Participate in external proficiency testing programs for CD25
analysis.
• Review and document proficiency testing results regularly.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Ensure proper mixing to prevent clumping and ensure accurate
result reading.
• Hemolysis, clotting, and contamination can affect results.
• Improper storage conditions can degrade sample quality and
affect CD25 detection.
