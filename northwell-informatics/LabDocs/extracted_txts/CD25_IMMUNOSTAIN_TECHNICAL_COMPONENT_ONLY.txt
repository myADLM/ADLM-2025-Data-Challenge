Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase of Generating Results for CD25
IMMUNOSTAIN, TECHNICAL COMPONENT ONLY
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for performing the immunohistochemical
staining of CD25 on tissue specimens, ensuring consistent, reliable,
and accurate results.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel involved in the
staining process for CD25 immunostain within the pathology
department.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated lab personnel are responsible for performing and
documenting each stage of the immunostaining process as per this
SOP.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
4.1. Acceptable Specimens
• Formalin-Fixed Paraffin-Embedded (FFPE) tissue sections on
positively charged slides.
4.2. Unacceptable Specimens
• Broken or improperly fixed tissue samples.
• Damaged slides or slides with unidentifiable labeling.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
5.1. Equipment
• Microtome
• Water bath
• Slide warmer
• Immunostainer (automated or manual)
• Microscope
5.2. Reagents
• Primary antibody: Anti-CD25
• Secondary antibody: Appropriate conjugate
• Detection system: HRP conjugate or other appropriate detection
systems
• Chromogen: DAB (3,3'-Diaminobenzidine) or other suitable
chromogen
• Counterstain: Hematoxylin
5.3. Supplies
• Positively charged slides
• Mounting medium
• Coverslips
• Distilled water
• Laboratory towels
6. PROCEDURE
6.1. Slide Preparation
1. Section FFPE tissue to 4-5 microns using a microtome.
2. Float sections on a water bath at 40°C to spread them evenly.
3. Mount sections onto positively charged slides.
4. Dry slides in a slide warmer at 60°C for 1 hour to ensure
adherence.
6.2. Deparaffinization and Rehydration
1. Deparaffinize slides in xylene (3 changes, 10 minutes each).
2. Rehydrate slides through graded alcohols to distilled water:
◦ 100% ethanol (2 changes, 5 minutes each)
◦ 95% ethanol (1 change, 5 minutes)
◦ 70% ethanol (1 change, 5 minutes)
◦ Rinse in distilled water
6.3. Antigen Retrieval
1. Perform antigen retrieval using appropriate buffer (e.g., citrate
buffer, pH 6.0) in a pressure cooker or water bath.
◦ Example: Heat slides in citrate buffer for 20 minutes at
95°C.
2. Allow slides to cool for 20 minutes at room temperature.
3. Rinse slides in distilled water followed by buffer wash (e.g., Tris-
buffered saline).
6.4. Staining Procedure
1. Block endogenous peroxidase activity by incubating slides in
3% hydrogen peroxide for 10 minutes. Rinse in buffer.
2. Incubate sections with blocking serum (normal serum matching
the host species of the secondary antibody) for 10-15 minutes
to reduce non-specific binding.
3. Incubate sections with primary antibody (Anti-CD25) diluted in
appropriate buffer, typically 1:50 to 1:200 in antibody diluent, for
30-60 minutes at room temperature or overnight at 4°C.
4. Rinse slides in buffer wash for 5 minutes.
5. Incubate with secondary antibody, diluted as recommended by
the manufacturer, for 20-30 minutes at room temperature.
6. Rinse in buffer wash for 5 minutes.
7. Apply detection system (HRP conjugate or other) according to
manufacturer’s instructions for 20-30 minutes.
8. Rinse in buffer wash for 5 minutes.
9. Incubate with chromogen (e.g., DAB) until desired staining
intensity is reached (typically 2-10 minutes).
10. Rinse in tap water followed by distilled water.
11. Counterstain with hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes, rinse in tap
water, and blue in 0.1% ammonia water or Scotts tap water
substitute.
12. Dehydrate slides through graded alcohols to xylene:
• 70% ethanol (1 change, 1 minute)
• 95% ethanol (1 change, 1 minute)
• 100% ethanol (2 changes, 1 minute each)
• Xylene (3 changes, 5 minutes each)
1. Mount coverslip with appropriate mounting medium.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
7.1. Positive Control:
• Include a known CD25 positive tissue section with each staining
run to ensure the reagents and procedure are working correctly.
7.2. Negative Control:
• Include a section treated identically except for the omission of the
primary antibody to verify the specificity of staining.
8. DOCUMENTATION
Document the following information on the Immunohistochemistry
Log:
• Date and time of staining
• Lot numbers and expiration dates of all reagents used
• Initials of the technologist performing the staining
• Observation of control slides (positive and negative)
9. TROUBLESHOOTING
If the staining quality is suboptimal, check and document the
following:
• Reagent expiration dates
• Equipment functionality
• Adequacy of antigen retrieval
• Proper section adhesion and processing If issues persist, repeat
the stain or consult with a supervisor.

• Manufacturer’s instructions for reagents and antibodies
• Laboratory guidelines for immunohistochemistry procedures
11. CONCLUSION
By following this SOP, consistent and accurate CD25 immunostaining
results can be obtained, ensuring high-quality diagnostic outcomes.
