Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for CD273 (PD-L2)
Immunostain - Technical Component Only
1. Purpose
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedures for the technical
component of the immunohistochemical staining process for CD273
(PD-L2). This protocol details the steps required for the preparation,
staining, and verification of tissue samples to ensure accurate and
reproducible results.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of designated laboratory personnel to follow this
SOP to ensure consistent and accurate results. All personnel must be
trained and qualified in the procedures outlined below.
2. Specimen
Specimen Required: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE)
tissue sections.
3. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies
• Microtome
• Water bath
• Heat block or oven
• Positive and negative tissue control slides
• Xylene
• Ethanol (100%, 95%, 70%)
• Distilled water
• Immunostaining Kit (including primary antibody for CD273 (PD-
L2), secondary antibody, chromogen)
• Mounting medium
• Cover slips
• Hematoxylin for counterstaining
4. Procedure
4.1. Tissue Sectioning and Preparation
1. Ensure FFPE tissue blocks are appropriately labeled and
traceable.
2. Cut 4-5 micron thick sections using the microtome.
3. Float sections in a water bath at 40-45°C, ensuring sections are
wrinkle-free.
4. Mount sections on positively charged slides.
5. Dry slides in an oven at 60°C for at least 1 hour or overnight at
37°C.
4.2. Deparaffinization and Rehydration
1. Deparaffinize slides by placing them in xylene for three 5-
minute changes.
2. Rehydrate sections through graded ethanol (100%, 95%, and
70%) for 2 minutes each.
3. Rinse in distilled water for 2 minutes.
4.3. Antigen Retrieval
1. Perform antigen retrieval using the specified method in the
immunostaining kit. Typically, this involves heating slides in a
retrieval solution (e.g., citrate buffer or EDTA buffer) using a
pressure cooker, microwave, or water bath.
2. Allow slides to cool to room temperature.
3. Rinse slides in distilled water and then in phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) for 5 minutes.
4.4. Blocking
1. Apply blocking solution provided in the immunostaining kit to
the tissue sections to minimize non-specific binding.
2. Incubate slides for the specified time (usually 10 minutes) at
room temperature.
3. Rinse slides in PBS.
4.5. Primary Antibody Application
1. Apply the primary antibody for CD273 (PD-L2) to the tissue
sections, ensuring complete coverage.
2. Incubate slides at the specified temperature and time (usually
at room temperature for 30-60 minutes or overnight at 4°C).
3. Rinse slides in PBS.
4.6. Secondary Antibody Application
1. Apply the secondary antibody provided in the kit to the tissue
sections.
2. Incubate for the specified time at room temperature (typically
20-30 minutes).
3. Rinse slides in PBS.
4.7. Chromogen Development
1. Apply the chromogen solution to the tissue sections.
2. Incubate for the specified time, usually 5-10 minutes, while
monitoring the development of color.
3. Rinse in distilled water to stop the reaction.
4.8. Counterstaining
1. Counterstain with hematoxylin to visualize nuclei. Dip slides in
hematoxylin for the specified time (usually 1-2 minutes).
2. Rinse slides in running tap water followed by distilled water.
4.9. Dehydration and Mounting
1. Dehydrate sections through graded ethanol (70%, 95%, 100%)
for 1-2 minutes each.
2. Clear sections in xylene for three 5-minute changes.
3. Apply mounting medium and cover slips to the slides.
5. Quality Control
1. Run positive and negative control slides with each batch of
staining to validate results.
2. Examine stained sections under a microscope to ensure
appropriate staining and the absence of background staining.
6. Documentation
1. Record all relevant information, including the specimen number,
date of staining, batch number of reagents, and any
observations, in the laboratory logbook.
2. Document the quality control results and any corrective actions
taken if discrepancies are found.
7. References
Refer to the manufacturer's instructions for the immunostaining kit,
reagent Safety Data Sheets (SDS), and relevant technical manuals
for detailed information and troubleshooting.
8. Health and Safety
1. Follow all laboratory safety guidelines, including the use of
personal protective equipment (PPE) such as lab coats, gloves,
and safety goggles.
2. Handle all reagents, particularly xylene and ethanol, in a fume
hood.
3. Dispose of all waste materials according to laboratory
hazardous waste protocols.
Approval and Review
This SOP must be reviewed annually and updated as necessary to
ensure compliance with current standards and practices.
