Protocol for the Analytical Phase of Generating Results for
CD279 (PD-1) Immunostain, Technical Component Only
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the analytical procedures for performing CD279
(PD-1) immunostaining on tissue specimens for the technical
component only. CD279 (PD-1) immunostaining is performed to aid in
the assessment of the expression of PD-1 on immune cells within the
tissue samples. The results generated from this procedure are used
for diagnostic and therapeutic decision-making in various clinical
settings.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory staff trained in immunohistochemistry (IHC)
techniques are responsible for performing the CD279 (PD-1)
immunostaining procedure according to this SOP. The laboratory
supervisor is responsible for ensuring that the procedure is followed
accurately and that quality control measures are in place.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
3.1. Acceptable Specimen Types: - Formalin-fixed, paraffin-
embedded (FFPE) tissue sections. - Each specimen should be
accompanied by appropriate clinical information and a requisition
form.
3.2. Unacceptable Specimen Types: - Specimens with improper
fixation or handling. - Specimens that are not appropriately labeled or
accompanied by required documentation.
4. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
4.1. Reagents: - Primary antibody for CD279 (PD-1) (specific
manufacturer and catalog number to be used as per laboratory
standard). - Manufacturer's recommended secondary antibody and
detection system. - Appropriate chromogen substrate. - Counterstain
(e.g., hematoxylin).
4.2. Supplies: - Glass microscope slides (positively charged). -
Quality control tissue sections (positive and negative controls). -
Cover slips and mounting media. - Humidified chamber for
incubation.
5. EQUIPMENT
5.1. Microtome for tissue sectioning. 5.2. Water bath for tissue
sectioning. 5.3. Oven or incubator for slide drying and baking. 5.4.
Automated immunostainer (optional, if available). 5.5. Light
microscope for quality assessment.
6. PROCEDURE
6.1. Tissue Sectioning: - Section FFPE tissue blocks at 4
micrometers thickness. - Place sections on positively charged glass
slides. - Bake slides at 60°C for 1 hour to ensure proper adhesion of
tissue sections.
6.2. Deparaffinization and Rehydration: - Deparaffinize slides by
placing them in xylene for 2 x 5 minutes. - Rehydrate slides through
graded ethanol series (100%, 95%, 70%) for 2 x 3 minutes each. -
Rinse slides in distilled water for 5 minutes.
6.3. Antigen Retrieval: - Perform antigen retrieval using citrate buffer
(pH 6.0) or EDTA buffer (pH 9.0), as per primary antibody
manufacturer's recommendation. - Heat in a microwave, pressure
cooker, or steamer at recommended settings. - Allow slides to cool to
room temperature and rinse in distilled water.
6.4. Blocking: - Incubate slides with protein blocking solution for 10
minutes to reduce non-specific binding. - Drain excess blocking
solution without washing.
6.5. Primary Antibody Incubation: - Apply the primary antibody
specific for CD279 (PD-1) to the tissue sections. - Incubate in a
humidified chamber at room temperature for 30-60 minutes or
overnight at 4°C, as per manufacturer's recommendation. - Rinse
slides in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or Tris-buffered saline
(TBS) for 3 x 5 minutes.
6.6. Secondary Antibody and Detection: - Apply the secondary
antibody and detection system according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. - Incubate in a humidified chamber for the recommended
time. - Rinse slides in PBS or TBS for 3 x 5 minutes. - Apply
chromogen substrate to develop staining and incubate for the
recommended time. - Rinse slides in water to stop the reaction.
6.7. Counterstaining: - Counterstain tissue sections with hematoxylin
for 1-2 minutes. - Rinse slides in running tap water to blue the
hematoxylin. - Dehydrate slides through graded ethanol series and
clear in xylene.
6.8. Mounting: - Coverslip slides using mounting media. - Allow slides
to dry.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
7.1. Include positive and negative control tissue sections with each
run of immunostaining. 7.2. Ensure that control tissues demonstrate
expected staining patterns. 7.3. If controls do not perform as
expected, do not report patient results; troubleshoot the issue and
repeat the test.
8. DOCUMENTATION AND REPORTING
8.1. Record the immunostaining procedure, including reagent lot
numbers and incubation times, in the laboratory logbook or electronic
system. 8.2. Document the results of control tissues and patient
tissue sections. 8.3. Forward stained slides to a pathologist for
interpretation. 8.4. Ensure results are reviewed and verified by a
designated technologist.
