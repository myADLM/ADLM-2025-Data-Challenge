Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for CD2 Immunostain,
Bone Marrow, Technical Component Only
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to provide detailed steps for the
processing, staining, and generating results for CD2 immunostaining
in bone marrow specimens, focusing on the technical component
only. This ensures consistent and accurate results for subsequent
pathological evaluation.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory technologists are responsible for performing
and documenting all steps of the immunostaining procedure
according to this SOP. Supervisors are responsible for overseeing
adherence to this procedure and ensuring all quality control
measures are met.
2. DEFINITIONS
CD2: A cell surface glycoprotein found on T-cells and natural killer
cells, used as a marker in immunohistochemistry. Bone Marrow
Specimen: Hematopoietic tissue collected from the medullary cavities
of bones, used for diagnostic purposes.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Automated stainer (e.g., Ventana BenchMark, Leica Bond)
• CD2 primary antibody
• Positive and negative control slides
• Antigen retrieval solution
• Detection kit (e.g., DAB chromogen)
• Hematoxylin counterstain
• Xylene and graded alcohols
• Mounting medium and coverslips
• Water bath
• Humidity chamber
4. PROCEDURE
A) Pre-Analytical Phase
1. Specimen Preparation
◦ Ensure the bone marrow specimen is fixed in 10% neutral
buffered formalin and adequately decalcified.
◦ Embed in paraffin and section the tissue at 3-5 microns.
◦ Place sections onto positively charged slides and bake at
60°C for 1 hour.
2. Controls
◦ Prepare positive control slides using known reactive tissue.
◦ Prepare negative control slides by omitting the primary
antibody.
B) Analytical Phase
1. Deparaffinization and Rehydration
◦ Place slides in xylene for 3 changes, 5 minutes each.
◦ Rehydrate through graded alcohols (100%, 95%, 70%) to
distilled water.
2. Antigen Retrieval
◦ Retrieve antigens using buffer solution in a microwave or
water bath, following the manufacturer’s instructions for the
CD2 antibody.
3. Immunostaining
◦ Place slides in the automated stainer.
◦ Load the CD2 primary antibody and detection kit reagents
into the respective stainer positions.
◦ Program the stainer according to the manufacturer’s
protocol for CD2 staining, including all incubation times and
temperatures.
◦ Perform washing steps with buffer solutions as required.
4. Counterstaining
◦ Stain slides with hematoxylin for 30 seconds to 1 minute.
◦ Rinse in running water.
5. Dehydration and Mounting
◦ Dehydrate slides through graded alcohols to xylene.
◦ Apply mounting medium and coverslip.
C) Post-Analytical Phase
1. Quality Control
◦ Evaluate the intensity and specificity of CD2 staining on
control slides to ensure assay validity.
◦ Document and troubleshoot any deviations or non-specific
staining.
2. Documentation
◦ Record details of the staining run, including lot numbers of
reagents, incubation times, and any deviations from the
SOP.
◦ Annotate results for internal quality control review.
3. Result Reporting
◦ Generate a report for pathologist review, including images of
stained sections if necessary.
◦ Verify accurate transmittance of staining results into the
Laboratory Information System (LIS).
5. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform daily instrument maintenance and calibrations according
to manufacturer guidelines.
• Verify staining performance periodically with internal and external
quality control samples.
• Address and rectify any staining inconsistencies or instrument
errors immediately.
6. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's instructions for specific reagents and instruments.
• Histology procedure guidelines and protocols.
• CLSI guidelines for immunohistochemistry.
7. REVISION HISTORY
Document any updates or changes to this protocol, including the
date, nature of the change, and the individual responsible for the
revision.
8. REVIEW
This SOP will be reviewed annually or as necessary by the laboratory
supervisor.
