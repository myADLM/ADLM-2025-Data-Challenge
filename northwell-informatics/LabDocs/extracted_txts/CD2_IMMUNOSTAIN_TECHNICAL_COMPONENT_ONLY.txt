Laboratory Standard Operating Procedure for CD2 Immunostain
Analysis (Technical Component Only)
1. PURPOSE
To provide standardized instructions for the technical component of
generating results for CD2 immunostaining in the laboratory.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel trained and
authorized to perform and report CD2 immunostain tests.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the laboratory technologist to accurately
follow this SOP and ensure all steps are performed as outlined to
guarantee the reliability and accuracy of test results. The laboratory
supervisor is responsible for monitoring adherence to this SOP and
addressing any deviations or issues identified during the procedure.
4. DEFINITION
CD2 Immunostain: CD2 is a surface antigen primarily used in the
immunohistochemical assessment of T-cells in human tissue.
5. PROCEDURE
5.1. Reagents, Equipment, and Supplies
• CD2 primary antibody (ensure it is not expired and has been
stored as per manufacturer instructions)
• Positive and negative control slides
• Blocking reagent
• Detection reagent (e.g., labeled secondary antibody)
• Counterstain (e.g., hematoxylin)
• Mounting medium
• Microscope slides and coverslips
• Immunostaining buffer
• Humidified chamber
• Micropipettes and tips
• Slide incubator
• Xylene and graded alcohols for tissue deparaffinization
• Water bath
• Proper PPE and laboratory safety equipment
5.2. Sample Preparation
1. Tissue Sectioning
◦ Section paraffin-embedded tissue blocks at 4-5
micrometers.
◦ Mount sections onto positively charged microscope slides.
2. Deparaffinization and Rehydration
◦ Place slides in xylene for 2 changes of 10 minutes each.
◦ Transfer slides through graded alcohols (100%, 95%, 70%)
for 3 minutes each.
◦ Rinse slides in distilled water.
5.3. Immunostaining Procedure
1. Antigen Retrieval
◦ Immerse slides in antigen retrieval solution as specified by
the CD2 antibody manufacturer.
◦ Heat in a microwave or pressure cooker as per protocol.
◦ Allow slides to cool, then rinse in distilled water.
2. Blocking
◦ Apply blocking reagent to cover the tissue section.
◦ Incubate for the time recommended by the manufacturer.
◦ Rinse slides in buffer solution.
3. Primary Antibody Incubation
◦ Cover the tissue section with CD2 primary antibody.
◦ Incubate in a humidified chamber for the time specified in
the antibody datasheet (usually 1 hour at room temperature
or overnight at 4°C).
◦ Rinse in buffer solution to remove any unbound antibody.
4. Detection Reagent Application
◦ Apply the secondary antibody or detection reagent to the
tissue section.
◦ Incubate slides for the recommended time period.
◦ Wash slides thoroughly in buffer solution to remove excess
detection reagent.
5. Counterstaining and Mounting
◦ Counterstain with hematoxylin for 2-3 minutes.
◦ Rinse slides in distilled water.
◦ Dehydrate through graded alcohols (70%, 95%, 100%) and
clear in xylene.
◦ Mount the slides using an appropriate mounting medium
and coverslips.
5.4. Quality Control
1. Control Slides
◦ Include positive control slides stained with each run to
ensure the staining procedure is functioning correctly.
◦ Negative control slides (omitting the primary antibody) must
also be included to confirm specificity.
2. Slide Evaluation
◦ Evaluate the slides under a microscope.
◦ Ensure specific staining of target antigens with minimal
background staining.
◦ Compare with control slides. If control slides do not perform
as expected, troubleshoot potential issues before reporting
patient results.
5.5. Documentation
1. Recording Results
◦ Document the staining results in laboratory records.
◦ Use standardized reporting forms as applicable.
◦ Ensure all relevant details are recorded, including control
performance and any deviations from the SOP.
2. Documentation of Control Results
◦ Record all control results, including batch numbers and
expiration dates of reagents used.
◦ Note any corrective actions taken during the run.
6. PROCEDURE REVIEW AND MAINTENANCE
1. Periodic Review of SOP
◦ The SOP shall be reviewed annually or whenever there is a
change in the procedure.
◦ Updates shall be made as necessary to ensure compliance
with best practices and regulatory guidelines.
2. Equipment Calibration and Maintenance
◦ Ensure all equipment is calibrated and maintained according
to manufacturer instructions and laboratory policy.
