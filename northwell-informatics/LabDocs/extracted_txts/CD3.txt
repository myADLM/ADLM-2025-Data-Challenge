Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase: CD3
Testing
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for the analysis of CD3 biomarkers in patient
samples using flow cytometry. This procedure ensures the accurate
and reproducible measurement of CD3 levels to aid in the diagnosis
and monitoring of immune-related conditions.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory staff are responsible for
performing and documenting the CD3 analysis. All staff must ensure
that the procedure is followed according to established guidelines
and that any issues are promptly reported to the supervisor.
1. DEFINITION
CD3 is a protein complex and an essential component of the T-cell
receptor (TCR) involved in activating T-cells in the immune response.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/acceptable specimen:
• Peripheral blood collected in EDTA or heparin tubes.
• Sample storage: Store at 2-8°C and analyze within 24 hours of
collection.
Unacceptable specimen:
• Specimens received more than 24 hours after collection.
• Specimens without proper labeling or missing collection date/time.
• Specimens showing signs of hemolysis or clotting.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Flow cytometer (calibrated and maintained per manufacturer’s
guidelines)
• CD3 antibody reagent (stored at 2-8°C; verified not expired)
• Fluorescent dyes appropriate for flow cytometry
• Sample tubes
• Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)
• Fixative solution
• Control cells: Positive and negative controls
1. PROCEDURE
Sample Preparation:
1. Verify sample identity and condition.
2. Aliquot 100 µL of well-mixed blood specimen into a labeled
sample tube.
3. Add 20 µL of CD3 antibody reagent to the sample tube.
4. Incubate the tube at room temperature for 15 minutes in the
dark.
5. Add 2 mL of PBS to each tube and centrifuge at 300g for 5
minutes.
6. Discard the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 500 µL of
PBS.
7. If fixation is required, add 500 µL fixative solution and incubate
for 10 minutes.
Flow Cytometry Analysis:
1. Perform instrument calibration per manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Load the sample onto the flow cytometer.
3. Verify proper cytometer settings (e.g., voltage, gates).
4. Run the sample and acquire data.
5. Record data for each sample and quality control checks.
6. Analyze data using flow cytometry software to determine the
percentage of CD3+ cells.
Troubleshooting:
• If the sample fails QC checks, repeat the staining and analysis
procedure.
• If instrument issues arise, consult the manufacturer’s
troubleshooting guide or contact technical support.
• Document all troubleshooting actions.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run positive and negative control cells alongside patient samples.
• Ensure all reagents are within expiry dates and properly stored.
• Monthly instrument calibration checks.
• Document all QC results and corrective actions.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results are automatically transmitted to the Laboratory
Information System (LIS) and must be reviewed and verified by
the technologist.
• Critical results must be promptly communicated to the ordering
physician per laboratory policy.
• Use site-specific guidelines for reporting reference intervals and
critical values.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• CD3+ cells: 60-85% of total lymphocytes (normal reference range,
may vary by population)
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolyzed or clotted samples can affect the accuracy of CD3
measurement.
• Improper storage or handling of specimens can lead to
degradation of CD3 markers.
• Ensure adherence to incubation times and temperatures specified
in the procedure.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s guidelines for flow cytometry equipment.
• Standard texts on immunophenotyping and flow cytometry.
• Peer-reviewed literature on CD3 biomarker testing.
1. DOCUMENTATION
Document all procedures, results, and QC activities in the
appropriate laboratory logs and electronic records. Ensure all entries
are signed and dated by the performing technologist.
This SOP for CD3 Testing ensures the reliability and accuracy of
results, supporting clinical decision-making in diagnosing and
managing immune-related conditions.
