Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Protocol for Analytical Phase: Generating Results for CD303
(BDCA-2) Immunostain, Technical Component Only
1. PURPOSE
To provide detailed instructions for the technical component of
performing CD303 (BDCA-2) immunostaining on clinical specimens
to ensure accurate and reproducible results.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all clinical specimens received in the
laboratory for CD303 (BDCA-2) immunohistochemical staining.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all laboratory personnel performing
immunohistochemical staining to follow this SOP to ensure the
accurate and reliable performance of the CD303 (BDCA-2)
immunostain. The supervisor is responsible for ensuring that all
personnel are trained and proficient in this procedure.
4. REAGENTS AND MATERIALS
• Primary antibody: CD303 (BDCA-2) antibody
• Antigen retrieval solution (e.g., citrate buffer, pH 6.0)
• Blocking solution (e.g., 5% BSA in PBS)
• Secondary antibody (e.g., HRP-conjugated anti-mouse/rabbit)
• DAB substrate kit
• Hematoxylin for counterstaining
• Mounting medium
• Positive control tissue (e.g., tissue known to express CD303)
• Negative control tissue (e.g., tissue known not to express CD303)
5. EQUIPMENT
• Microtome
• Water bath
• Slide racks and staining dishes
• Humidity chamber
• Light microscope
• Heating apparatus (e.g., microwave, pressure cooker) for antigen
retrieval
6. SAFETY PRECAUTIONS
• Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) including
lab coat, gloves, and eye protection.
• Handle all reagents and specimens following standard laboratory
safety protocols.
• Dispose of all hazardous waste according to institutional
guidelines.
7. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Preparation
1. Specimen Receiving
◦ Verify the identity and labeling of the received specimens
according to the laboratory's accessioning protocol.
2. Sectioning
◦ Cut 3-5 μm thick sections from the formalin-fixed, paraffin-
embedded tissue blocks using a microtome.
◦ Place sections on positively charged microscope slides.
3. Deparaffinization and Rehydration
◦ Deparaffinize sections by immersing slides in three changes
of xylene for 5 minutes each.
◦ Rehydrate sections through a graded series of ethanol
(100%, 95%, 70%) for 3 minutes each.
◦ Rinse slides in distilled water for 5 minutes.
B. Antigen Retrieval
1. Place slides in a staining dish containing antigen retrieval
solution (citrate buffer, pH 6.0).
2. Heat the slides in a microwave or pressure cooker according to
the manufacturer's instructions for antigen retrieval.
3. Allow slides to cool to room temperature and rinse in PBS for 5
minutes.
C. Immunostaining
1. Blocking
◦ Incubate slides in blocking solution for 10 minutes at room
temperature to reduce non-specific binding.
2. Primary Antibody Incubation
◦ Incubate sections with CD303 (BDCA-2) primary antibody at
the optimized dilution (as per manufacturer’s instructions)
for 30-60 minutes at room temperature in a humidity
chamber.
◦ Rinse slides in PBS for 5 minutes.
3. Secondary Antibody Incubation
◦ Incubate sections with HRP-conjugated secondary antibody
for 30 minutes at room temperature.
◦ Rinse slides in PBS for 5 minutes.
4. DAB Substrate Development
◦ Apply DAB substrate solution to the slides and incubate for
2-10 minutes or until the desired color intensity is achieved.
◦ Rinse slides in distilled water to stop the reaction.
5. Counterstaining
◦ Counterstain sections with hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes.
◦ Rinse slides in tap water and then dip briefly in acidic
alcohol to differentiate.
◦ Rinse well with tap water and blue in ammonia water or
Scott's tap water substitute.
◦ Rinse slides in distilled water.
6. Mounting
◦ Dehydrate sections through graded alcohols (70%, 95%,
100%) and clear in xylene.
◦ Apply a coverslip using mounting medium.
D. Quality Control
1. Include positive and negative control slides in each staining run
to ensure staining specificity and reliability.
2. Document the staining results of control tissues in the relevant
logbook.
8. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
• Examine the stained slides under a light microscope.
• Evaluate the presence and intensity of CD303 (BDCA-2) staining
in the tissue sections.
• Document any non-specific staining or artifacts observed.
9. REPORTING
• Report the technical findings as "Technical Component Only"
indicating that the interpretation of results is not included.
• Ensure all necessary documentation is completed and archived
according to laboratory protocols.
10. MAINTENANCE OF EQUIPMENT
• Perform routine maintenance and calibration of all equipment as
per the manufacturer's specifications and laboratory schedules.
• Record maintenance activities in the equipment log.
11. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions for the CD303 (BDCA-2) antibody.
• Standard immunohistochemical protocols and guidelines.
• Laboratory safety and quality control manuals.
12. DOCUMENTATION
• Maintain all records regarding the performance of assays, quality
control, and equipment maintenance.
• Ensure proper documentation of any deviations from the SOP and
corrective actions taken.
