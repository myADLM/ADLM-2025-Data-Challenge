STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE
CD30 Immunostain, Technical Component Only
1. PURPOSE: To outline the steps required for the technical
component of generating results for CD30 immunostain,
ensuring accuracy, repeatability, and quality control in the
results.
2. SCOPE: This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel
responsible for the technical component of CD30
immunostaining in the laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY:
◦ It is the responsibility of all designated histotechnologists to
perform CD30 immunostaining according to this SOP.
◦ Laboratory supervisors must ensure that all personnel are
adequately trained and competency is maintained.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS:
◦ Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue sections.
◦ Specimens must be stored at room temperature before
processing.
◦ Unacceptable specimens include those that are improperly
fixed, inadequately preserved, or damaged during handling.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES:
◦ Microtome
◦ Glass slides
◦ CD30 primary antibody
◦ Secondary antibody (appropriate to the CD30 primary
antibody)
◦ Detection system (e.g., EnVision, ABC kits)
◦ Counterstain (e.g., hematoxylin)
◦ Mounting medium
◦ Coverslips
◦ Positive and negative control tissues
◦ Automated immunostainer (if applicable)
◦ Humidified chamber (if performing manually)
◦ Water bath
◦ Timer
6. PROCEDURE:
Section Preparation:
1. Cut 4-5 µm thick sections from FFPE tissue blocks using
a microtome.
2. Place sections on glass slides and air dry overnight or
incubate at 60°C for 30 minutes.
Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
1. Immerse slides in xylene for 10 minutes (2 changes).
2. Immerse slides in 100% ethanol for 5 minutes (2
changes).
3. Immerse slides in 95% ethanol for 5 minutes.
4. Rinse slides in running water for 5 minutes.
Antigen Retrieval:
1. Heat-induced epitope retrieval (HIER) in citrate buffer (pH
6.0) or EDTA buffer (pH 9.0).
2. Place slides in antigen retrieval solution and heat in a
water bath or microwave at 95-100°C for 20-30 minutes.
3. Allow slides to cool in the retrieval solution for 20 minutes
at room temperature.
4. Rinse slides in distilled water.
Blocking Endogenous Peroxidase Activity:
1. Treat sections with 3% hydrogen peroxide in methanol for
10 minutes to block endogenous peroxidase activity.
2. Rinse slides in running water for 5 minutes.
Blocking Non-Specific Binding (if applicable):
1. Incubate sections with blocking buffer (e.g., 5% normal
serum from the same species as the secondary antibody)
for 20 minutes at room temperature.
2. Drain slides but do not rinse.
Primary Antibody:
1. Apply CD30 primary antibody to sections and incubate in
a humidified chamber for 1 hour at room temperature or
overnight at 4°C.
2. Rinse slides in PBS or TBS (3x5 minutes).
Secondary Antibody:
1. Apply appropriate secondary antibody and incubate for 30
minutes at room temperature.
2. Rinse slides in PBS or TBS (3x5 minutes).
Detection System:
1. Apply detection system (e.g., EnVision, ABC kits) and
incubate as per manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Rinse slides in PBS or TBS (3x5 minutes).
Chromogen Development:
1. Apply chromogen (e.g., DAB) and incubate for 5-10
minutes, monitoring the development under a microscope.
2. Rinse slides in running distilled water.
Counterstaining:
1. Counterstain with hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes.
2. Rinse slides in running tap water for 5-10 minutes.
3. Optionally, blue the nucleus in a weak ammonia water
solution and rinse.
Dehydration and Clearing:
1. Dehydrate slides by immersing in graded series of
alcohols (95%, 100%) for 5 minutes each.
2. Clear in xylene for 10 minutes (2 changes).
Mounting:
1. Mount slides with a coverslip using an appropriate
mounting medium.
7. QUALITY CONTROL:
◦ Include known positive and negative control tissue on each
staining run.
◦ Document lot numbers and expiration dates of primary
antibody and detection systems.
◦ Ensure proper documentation of reagent preparation,
sample handling, and staining protocols.
8. REPORTING RESULTS:
◦ The technical component of staining results will be recorded
in the laboratory information system (LIS).
◦ Documentation must include identification of the
technologist performing the procedure, date of staining, and
any deviations from protocol.
9. REFERENCES:
◦ Manufacturer’s instructions for CD30 primary antibody.
◦ Manufacturer’s instructions for detection systems.
◦ Current laboratory guidelines on immunohistochemistry
procedures.
10. TROUBLESHOOTING:
◦ If staining results are suboptimal, review and adjust antigen
retrieval conditions, antibody concentrations, or incubation
times.
◦ Confirm the validity of reagent expiration dates and
effectiveness.
*This SOP must be reviewed and approved by the laboratory director
prior to implementation.
