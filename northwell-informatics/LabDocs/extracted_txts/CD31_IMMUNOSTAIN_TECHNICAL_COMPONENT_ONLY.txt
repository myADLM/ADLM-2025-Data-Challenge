Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase of Generating Results for CD31 Immunostain,
Technical Component Only
Purpose: To provide a detailed procedure for the technical aspects of
performing CD31 immunostaining for the detection of endothelial
cells in tissue sections, ensuring consistent and accurate results.
Scope: This procedure applies to designated laboratory staff
responsible for performing CD31 immunostaining in a CLIA-certified
laboratory.
Responsibilities:
• Designated laboratory staff perform and document the CD31
immunostaining procedure.
• Laboratory supervisors ensure the protocol is followed and
address any technical issues that arise.
Definitions:
• CD31: Cluster of Differentiation 31, also known as PECAM-1, is a
protein found on the surface of endothelial cells and is used as a
marker for identifying blood vessel formation in tissue samples.
Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies:
• Microtome
• Water bath
• Slide racks
• Humidity chambers
• Heat source (oven or hot plate)
• Xylene
• Absolute ethanol
• Graded ethanol series (100%, 95%, 70% ethanol)
• PBS (phosphate-buffered saline)
• Antigen retrieval solution (e.g., citrate buffer, pH 6.0)
• Blocker (e.g., normal serum or BSA)
• Primary antibody: CD31 (mouse monoclonal or rabbit polyclonal)
• Secondary antibody: HRP-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit
• DAB (diaminobenzidine) substrate
• Hematoxylin counterstain
• Mounting medium
• Glass slides and coverslips
• Positive control tissue (e.g., tonsil)
• Negative control (slide omitting the primary antibody)
• Timer
• Forceps
• Microscope
Procedure:
A. PREPARATION OF SLIDES
1. Ensure tissue sections are embedded in paraffin and sectioned
at 4-5 micrometers using a microtome.
2. Place tissue sections on glass slides and let them dry overnight
at 37°C or for at least 1 hour at 60°C.
B. DEPARAFFINIZATION AND REHYDRATION
1. Deparaffinize sections in xylene for 2 changes of 10 minutes
each.
2. Hydrate sections in a series of graded ethanols: 100% ethanol
(2 changes, 3 minutes each), 95% ethanol (1 change, 3
minutes), 70% ethanol (1 change, 3 minutes), and rinse in
distilled water (2 changes, 5 minutes each).
C. ANTIGEN RETRIEVAL
1. Perform antigen retrieval by immersing slides in citrate buffer
(pH 6.0).
2. Heat the slides in a microwave, water bath, or pressure cooker
according to the validated method until optimal retrieval is
achieved (e.g., 20 minutes at 95°C).
3. Allow slides to cool for 20 minutes at room temperature.
4. Rinse slides in PBS (2 changes, 5 minutes each).
D. BLOCKING
1. Block endogenous peroxidase activity by immersing slides in
3% hydrogen peroxide in PBS for 10 minutes.
2. Rinse slides in PBS (2 changes, 5 minutes each).
3. Block non-specific binding by incubating slides with blocking
solution (such as 5% BSA or normal serum in PBS) for 30
minutes at room temperature in a humidity chamber.
E. PRIMARY ANTIBODY INCUBATION
1. Incubate sections with the primary antibody (CD31) at the
recommended dilution in PBS or antibody diluent.
2. Incubate in a humidity chamber for 1 hour at room temperature
or overnight at 4°C.
3. Rinse slides in PBS (2 changes, 5 minutes each).
F. SECONDARY ANTIBODY AND DAB DETECTION
1. Incubate sections with HRP-conjugated secondary antibody at
the recommended dilution for 30 minutes at room temperature.
2. Rinse slides in PBS (2 changes, 5 minutes each).
3. Prepare DAB substrate according to the manufacturer’s
instructions and apply to sections for 5-10 minutes or until
desired staining intensity develops.
4. Rinse slides in PBS (2 changes, 5 minutes each).
G. COUNTERSTAINING AND MOUNTING
1. Counterstain sections with hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes.
2. Rinse sections in running tap water for 5 minutes.
3. Dehydrate sections in ascending alcohol series: 70% ethanol (1
change, 3 minutes), 95% ethanol (1 change, 3 minutes), 100%
ethanol (2 changes, 3 minutes each).
4. Clear sections in xylene (2 changes, 3 minutes each).
5. Mount coverslips using mounting medium.
QUALITY CONTROL
1. Include positive and negative control slides in each staining run.
2. Document staining results and assess for specificity and
background staining.
3. If discrepancies occur, troubleshoot and repeat staining as
required.
REPORTING RESULTS: Technical results are reviewed and
documented by the laboratory technologist. The pathologist will
interpret the IHC-stained slides, and results will be finalized and
reported according to laboratory protocols.
