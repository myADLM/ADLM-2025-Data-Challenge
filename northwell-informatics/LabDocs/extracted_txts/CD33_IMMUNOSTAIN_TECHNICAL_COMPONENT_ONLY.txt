Protocol for CD33 Immunostain, Technical Component Only
1. PURPOSE
This protocol outlines the procedures for conducting the technical
component of the CD33 immunostain in our laboratory, ensuring
accurate and reliable results. CD33 is a useful marker for diagnosis
and prognosis in hematological malignancies.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory personnel perform CD33 immunostain
following this protocol. Supervisors ensure all procedures are
followed and provide corrective actions when necessary.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Acceptable Specimens:
• Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens that have not been properly fixed.
• Specimens with insufficient tissue.
• Specimens with visible artifacts that may compromise staining
quality.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Microtome
• Slide warming trays
• Xylene
• Ethanol (100%, 96%,70%)
• Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS)
• CD33 primary antibody
• Secondary antibody (conjugated, specific to primary antibody)
• Detection system (e.g., HRP-conjugated polymer)
• Chromogen (e.g., DAB)
• Hematoxylin
• Coverslips
• Mounting medium
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation of Slides:
1. Sections of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue are cut at
4µm thickness and placed on positively charged slides.
2. Slides are warmed to 60°C for 1 hour to ensure proper
adhesion of tissue sections.
B. Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
1. Deparaffinize slides by immersing them in xylene for 10 minutes
(repeat twice).
2. Rehydrate sections stepwise through graded ethanol solutions
(100%, 96%, 70%) for 5 minutes each, then rinse in distilled
water.
C. Antigen Retrieval:
1. Perform antigen retrieval by placing slides in a preheated
solution (e.g., citrate buffer pH 6.0) and heat in a microwave or
water bath for 20 minutes.
2. Allow slides to cool for 20 minutes at room temperature and
then rinse in PBS.
D. Blocking:
1. Apply blocking solution to prevent non-specific binding.
Incubate for 10 minutes at room temperature.
2. Rinse slides in PBS.
E. Primary Antibody Incubation:
1. Apply CD33 primary antibody to sections and incubate for 1
hour at room temperature or overnight at 4°C, as per
manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Rinse slides in PBS.
F. Secondary Antibody and Detection System:
1. Apply secondary antibody conjugated to a detection polymer
and incubate for 30 minutes at room temperature.
2. Rinse slides in PBS.
G. Chromogen Reaction:
1. Apply chromogen (e.g., DAB) to sections and observe under a
microscope until desired staining intensity is achieved (usually
5-10 minutes).
2. Rinse slides in distilled water.
H. Counterstaining:
1. Counterstain with hematoxylin for 1 minute.
2. Rinse in distilled water.
3. Dip slides in graded ethanol solutions and xylene.
I. Mounting:
1. Apply coverslips using a suitable mounting medium.
2. QUALITY CONTROL
• Positive control: Include a section known to express CD33 to
ensure staining procedure is correctly performed.
• Negative control: Include a section without the primary antibody to
demonstrate specificity of staining.
QC Procedure: - For each new batch or lot of CD33 antibody,
perform QC with known positive and negative controls. - Document
the results as per site-specific guidelines.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
Results Review: - Verify the presence and quality of staining before
reporting. - Technologist records staining patterns and intensity in
accordance with site-specific reporting guidelines. Documentation: -
Technologist initials and date are documented on the appropriate log
sheet.
1. SAFETY
• Follow laboratory safety guidelines and wear appropriate PPE
(e.g., lab coat, gloves, goggles).
1. TROUBLESHOOTING
If staining is inconsistent or artefacts are present: - Review reagent
expiry and preparation. - Ensure proper antigen retrieval was
performed. - Verify antibody concentrations and incubation times. -
Ensure that slides were adequately blocked to prevent non-specific
staining.
