Standard Operating Procedure: CD34 Immunostain - Technical
Component Only
1. PURPOSE:
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedural steps required
for the staining and analysis of CD34 immunostains, focusing
exclusively on the technical component. CD34 is a marker used
primarily for identifying hematopoietic progenitor cells and endothelial
cells in various tissues.
2. SCOPE:
This procedure applies to all personnel involved in the technical
processing of CD34 immunostains in the laboratory, including
histotechnicians and lab technologists.
3. RESPONSIBILITY:
Staff responsible for adhering to this SOP include:
• Histotechnicians for specimen preparation and staining.
• Laboratory technologists for quality control and analysis.
• Supervisors for oversight and troubleshooting.
4. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS:
• Microtome
• Water bath
• Slide racks and holders
• Heat source (e.g., hot plate or oven)
• Xylene
• Ethanol (100%, 95%, 70%)
• Peroxidase blocking reagent
• Rabbit anti-CD34 primary antibody
• Detection system (e.g., Dako EnVision+ System)
• DAB (3,3'-Diaminobenzidine) substrate
• Hematoxylin counterstain
• Mounting medium
• Coverslips
• Prepared formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue sections
5. PROCEDURE:
5.1. Slide Preparation:
a. Microtomy:
• Section paraffin-embedded blocks at 4 micrometers thickness and
place sections on positively charged slides.
• Dry slides overnight at 37°C or for 1 hour at 60°C.
b. Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
• Deparaffinize sections in xylene for 10 minutes (repeat twice).
• Rehydrate through graded alcohols: 100% ethanol for 5 minutes,
95% ethanol for 5 minutes, then 70% ethanol for 5 minutes.
• Rinse in distilled water for 5 minutes.
5.2. Antigen Retrieval:
• Perform heat-induced epitope retrieval using citrate buffer (pH
6.0) in a microwave, pressure cooker, or water bath typically for
20 minutes.
• Allow sections to cool for 20 minutes at room temperature.
• Rinse slides in distilled water.
5.3. Blocking Endogenous Peroxidase:
• Incubate sections in peroxidase blocking reagent (e.g., 3%
hydrogen peroxide) for 10 minutes to block endogenous
peroxidase activity.
• Rinse in distilled water followed by PBS (Phosphate-Buffered
Saline) or TBS (Tris-Buffered Saline).
5.4. Primary Antibody Incubation:
• Apply primary antibody (rabbit anti-CD34) to sections and
incubate for 30 minutes to 1 hour at room temperature, or
according to the manufacturer's instructions.
• Rinse slides in PBS or TBS.
5.5. Detection System:
• Apply the detection system (e.g., Dako EnVision+ System) and
incubate for the time specified by the manufacturer, usually 30
minutes.
• Rinse in PBS or TBS.
5.6. Chromogen Development:
• Apply DAB substrate and incubate for 5 minutes or until desired
staining intensity is reached.
• Rinse sections in water.
5.7. Counterstaining:
• Counterstain with hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes.
• Rinse in distilled water.
• Differentiate in 0.1% hydrochloric acid in ethanol if necessary.
• Blue in running tap water for 5 minutes.
5.8. Dehydration and Mounting:
• Dehydrate through graded alcohols: 70% ethanol, 95% ethanol,
and 100% ethanol (2 changes each for 2 minutes).
• Clear in xylene (2 changes for 5 minutes each).
• Mount coverslips with a suitable mounting medium.
6. QUALITY CONTROL:
• Employ positive and negative control slides with each batch of
CD34 staining to verify the specificity and performance of the
staining process.
• Document all steps and observations in the laboratory log.
7. REPORTING RESULTS:
• Results of CD34 immunostains involving the technical component
only should be reviewed by a pathologist.
• Pathologists provide the final interpretation and report, ensuring
quality results consistent with clinical requirements.
8. TROUBLESHOOTING:
• In case of weak or absent staining, verify antigen retrieval process
and primary antibody incubation steps.
• Ensure the integrity of reagents and follow manufacturer’s
guidelines for antibody dilutions and incubation times.
• Record any deviations and corrective measures taken.
9. REFERENCES:
• Manufacturer’s instructions for primary antibody and detection
system.
• Laboratory manual for histological procedures.
