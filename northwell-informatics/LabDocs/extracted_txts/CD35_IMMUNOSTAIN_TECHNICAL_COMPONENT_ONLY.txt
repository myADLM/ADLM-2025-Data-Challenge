CD35 Immunostain, Analytical Phase Protocol
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this protocol is to outline the standard operating
procedure for the analytical phase of generating results for CD35
immunostain, focusing solely on the technical components. This
includes the preparation, staining, and initial assessment to ensure
the quality required for subsequent interpretation by a pathologist.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the designated histotechnologist to perform
and document all tasks related to the CD35 immunostain procedure.
The supervising pathologist or designated senior lab staff will ensure
that all technical procedures adhere to the outlined SOP, and any
deficiencies are addressed promptly.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
For CD35 immunostaining, formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE)
tissue sections are required. Specimens must be properly fixed and
processed to ensure optimal staining quality.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Microtome
• Water bath
• Staining racks
• Incubator
• Humidifying chamber
• CD35 primary antibody
• Secondary antibody
• Detection system
• Hematoxylin counterstain
• Positive control slides
• Negative control slides
• Microscope
• Xylene
• Absolute ethanol and graded alcohols
• Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)
• Mounting medium
5. PROCEDURE
A. Section Preparation
1. Cut 4-5 micron sections from the FFPE tissue block using a
microtome.
2. Float sections on a water bath at 45-50°C, then pick up
sections onto positively charged slides.
3. Dry slides in an incubator at 60°C for a minimum of 1 hour to
ensure adhesion.
B. Deparaffinization and Rehydration
1. Place slides in xylene for 10 minutes twice.
2. Transfer slides through the following ethanol solutions:
◦ 100% ethanol I: 5 minutes
◦ 100% ethanol II: 5 minutes
◦ 95% ethanol: 2 minutes
◦ 70% ethanol: 2 minutes
◦ Rinse in distilled water for 2 minutes.
C. Antigen Retrieval
1. Place slides in a preheated antigen retrieval solution (e.g.,
citrate buffer, pH 6.0) and heat in a microwave or pressure
cooker for the recommended time (e.g., 20 minutes).
2. Allow slides to cool at room temperature for 20 minutes.
3. Rinse slides in running tap water for 5 minutes followed by PBS
(pH 7.2) for 5 minutes.
D. Immunostaining
1. Block endogenous peroxidase activity by incubating slides in
3% hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) in methanol for 10 minutes.
2. Wash slides in PBS for 5 minutes.
3. Apply a protein block solution to each section and incubate for
10 minutes.
4. Incubate sections with primary CD35 antibody (dilution as
recommended by the manufacturer) for 1 hour at room
temperature or overnight at 4°C in a humidifying chamber.
5. Wash slides in PBS for 5 minutes.
6. Apply the biotinylated secondary antibody and incubate for 30
minutes at room temperature.
7. Wash slides in PBS for 5 minutes.
8. Incubate slides with the streptavidin-biotin complex (ABC)
reagent or equivalent for 30 minutes at room temperature.
9. Wash slides in PBS for 5 minutes.
10. Develop the color by applying the 3,3'-diaminobenzidine (DAB)
substrate until the desired staining intensity is achieved (usually
2-10 minutes), monitoring under a microscope.
11. Wash slides in tap water to stop the reaction.
E. Counterstaining
1. Counterstain slides with hematoxylin for 1 minute.
2. Rinse slides in running tap water until clear.
3. Dip slides in 0.3% acid alcohol (1-2 seconds) to differentiate if
needed.
4. Rinse slides in running tap water for 5 minutes.
F. Dehydration and Mounting
1. Dehydrate slides through graded ethanol solutions (70%, 95%,
100%) and xylene.
2. Apply coverslips using an appropriate mounting medium.
G. Quality Control
1. Include positive and negative control slides with each batch to
ensure assay validity.
2. Document all staining parameters and any deviations from the
protocol.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
• The stained slides are prepared for review by a pathologist.
• The pathologist evaluates the staining quality and determines the
CD35 immunostaining results.
• The histotechnologist ensures that all documentation is complete
and accurate, indicating the staining quality and any incidents that
occurred during the analytical phase.
7. STORAGE AND DISPOSAL
• Properly store used reagents according to manufacturer
instructions.
• Dispose of waste materials, including slides and reagents,
following laboratory safety protocols and regulations.
