Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase Protocol for CD38 Immunostain - Technical
Component Only
1. PURPOSE
This protocol outlines the steps to be followed during the analytical
phase of generating results for CD38 immunostain (technical
component only) to ensure accurate and reliable results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
• It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory technologist to
perform the CD38 immunostaining procedure according to this
SOP.
• It is the responsibility of laboratory supervisors to ensure that all
staff involved in immunostaining are trained and competent in
performing this procedure.
• Any deviations from the protocol must be documented, and the
supervisor must be informed immediately.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENT
• Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue sections.
• Tissue sections should be cut at 3-5 microns thickness and
mounted on positively charged microscope slides.
• Ensure specimens are properly labeled with patient identifiers.
4. MATERIALS AND REAGENTS
• CD38 primary antibody
• Secondary antibody (biotinylated)
• Chromogen (DAB or other appropriate chromogens)
• Counterstain (e.g., Hematoxylin)
• Mounting medium
• Positive and negative control tissues
Equipment:
• Microtome
• Water bath
• Incubator or oven
• Immunostainer (automated system or manual technique)
• Microscope
5. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation of Reagents:
1. Ensure all reagents are freshly prepared and at the appropriate
working concentrations.
2. Prepare wash buffers and chromogen solutions according to
manufacturer instructions.
B. Slide Preparation:
1. Sectioning of FFPE blocks:
◦ Cut sections at 3-5 microns.
◦ Float sections on a water bath maintained at the appropriate
temperature.
◦ Mount sections on positively charged slides.
◦ Dry slides overnight in a 37°C oven or for 1-2 hours at 60°C.
C. Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
1. Deparaffinize slides by immersing in xylene (2 changes, 10
minutes each).
2. Rehydrate through graded alcohol series (100%, 95%, 70%,
and 50% ethanol – 5 minutes each).
3. Rinse in distilled water for 5 minutes each to remove residual
alcohol.
D. Antigen Retrieval:
1. Perform antigen retrieval using a validated method optimized
for CD38 antigen (e.g., heat-induced epitope retrieval in citrate
buffer pH 6.0).
2. Allow slides to cool at room temperature for 20 minutes and
rinse in distilled water.
E. Immunostaining Procedure:
1. Block endogenous peroxidase activity by treating slides with
3% hydrogen peroxide in methanol for 10 minutes.
2. Wash slides with wash buffer (e.g., phosphate-buffered saline).
3. Apply primary antibody (CD38) to each slide:
◦ Incubate according to manufacturer’s recommendations
(typically 1 hour at room temperature).
4. Wash slides thoroughly with wash buffer (e.g., phosphate-
buffered saline for 5 minutes).
5. Apply secondary antibody:
◦ Incubate according to manufacturer’s recommendations
(typically 30 minutes at room temperature).
6. Wash slides thoroughly with wash buffer.
7. Apply chromogen (e.g., DAB):
◦ Incubate until the desired color intensity develops (typically
5-10 minutes).
8. Rinse slides in distilled water.
F. Counterstaining:
1. Counterstain with hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes.
2. Rinse in distilled water.
3. Blueing step: Dip in weak ammonia water or Scotts tap water
substitute.
G. Dehydration and Mounting:
1. Dehydrate through graded alcohol series (70%, 95%, 100%
ethanol - 5 minutes each).
2. Clear slides in xylene (2 changes, 5 minutes each).
3. Mount coverslips using permanent mounting medium.
H. Quality Control:
• Include positive and negative controls with each batch of staining.
• Ensure there is no background staining in the negative control.
• Evaluate the staining pattern in the positive control to ensure
specificity and appropriate staining intensity.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
• The technologist performing the immunostain should not be
involved in interpreting or reporting the results.
• Results are submitted to the pathologist or the designated
diagnostician for review and diagnostic interpretation.
7. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions for CD38 antibody and detection kit.
• Laboratory-specific guidelines and protocols.
• Current literature on CD38 immunohistochemistry procedures.
8. DOCUMENT CONTROL
• Document any deviations from this SOP and corrective actions
taken.
• Review and update this SOP annually or as needed to reflect
changes in best practices.
