Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase of Generating Results for CD3
Immunostain, Technical Component Only
1. PURPOSE
To outline the standardized procedures for the analytical phase of
generating results for CD3 immunostain, technical component only,
ensuring accurate, consistent, and reliable staining of tissue sections.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all laboratory personnel to adhere to this
SOP during the analytical phase of generating results for CD3
immunostain. Laboratory personnel must also ensure adherence to
all relevant safety protocols and report any discrepancies or
malfunctions to their supervisor immediately.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue
sections. Thickness: 3-4 micrometers. Placement: Mounted on
positively charged slides. Condition: Sections must be completely
adhered to the slides, free of folds or wrinkles, and properly labeled.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
Equipment:
• Microtome
• Water bath (set at 40-45°C)
• Hot plate or slide warmer
• Immunostaining workstation
• Light microscope
Reagents:
• Primary antibody: CD3 (rabbit polyclonal antibody or other
validated clone)
• Secondary antibody: HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG
• DAB chromogen solution with substrate buffer
• Wash buffers: Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or Tris-buffered
saline (TBS)
• Blocking solution: 3% hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in methanol
• Antigen retrieval solution: Citrate buffer (pH 6.0) or EDTA buffer
(pH 8.0)
• Mounting medium
• Hematoxylin for counterstaining
• Deionized water
1. PROCEDURE
5.1 Pre-analytical Checks:
• Verify the integrity of the tissue sections and their labels.
• Ensure the microtome has been properly cleaned and calibrated.
• Confirm that all reagents and antibodies are within their expiration
dates and have been stored correctly.
5.2 Staining Protocol:
1. Sectioning and Mounting:
◦ Cut FFPE tissue blocks into 3-4 micrometer sections using a
microtome.
◦ Float sections in a 40-45°C water bath for a few seconds.
◦ Carefully mount sections onto positively charged slides.
◦ Dry slides on a hot plate or slide warmer at 60°C for 30
minutes to ensure complete adherence.
2. Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
◦ Deparaffinize the slides in three changes of xylene, 5
minutes each.
◦ Rehydrate through a graded series of ethanol (100%, 95%,
80%, and 70%) for 3 minutes each.
◦ Rinse in deionized water for 5 minutes.
3. Antigen Retrieval:
◦ Immerse slides in citrate buffer (pH 6.0) or EDTA buffer (pH
8.0).
◦ Perform heat-induced antigen retrieval using a microwave or
pressure cooker, following the manufacturer's instructions.
◦ Allow slides to cool for 20 minutes at room temperature.
◦ Rinse slides in PBS or TBS.
4. Blocking Endogenous Peroxidase Activity:
◦ Incubate slides in 3% hydrogen peroxide in methanol for 10
minutes.
◦ Rinse thoroughly with PBS or TBS.
5. Primary Antibody Incubation:
◦ Incubate sections with CD3 primary antibody, optimized
dilution, for 60 minutes at room temperature or overnight at
4°C.
◦ Rinse slides in PBS or TBS.
6. Secondary Antibody Incubation:
◦ Incubate sections with HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG for
30 minutes at room temperature.
◦ Rinse slides in PBS or TBS.
7. Chromogen Development:
◦ Apply DAB chromogen solution to sections and incubate for
5-10 minutes, or until desired staining intensity is achieved.
◦ Rinse slides in deionized water to stop the reaction.
8. Counterstaining:
◦ Counterstain gently with hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes.
◦ Rinse in deionized water.
◦ Differentiate in weak acid alcohol (optional) and rinse in
deionized water.
9. Dehydration and Mounting:
◦ Dehydrate through a graded series of ethanol (70%, 80%,
95%, and 100%) for 3 minutes each.
◦ Clear in xylene for 5 minutes.
◦ Mount coverslips using mounting medium.
5.3 Quality Control:
• Include positive control slides to ensure stain specificity and
sensitivity.
• Include negative control slides (omitting primary antibody) to
detect non-specific binding.
• Document all staining steps, reagents, and quality control
measures.
1. RESULTS INTERPRETATION AND DOCUMENTATION
• Examine stained slides under a light microscope.
• Confirm the presence and intensity of CD3 staining in T-
lymphocytes compared to controls.
• Document any discrepancies or artifacts observed during the
staining process.
• Prepare a report noting the completion of the technical
component, and relay findings to the pathologist for diagnostic
interpretation.
