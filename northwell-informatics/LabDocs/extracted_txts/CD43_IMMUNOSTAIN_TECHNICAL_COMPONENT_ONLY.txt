Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for CD43 Immunostain,
Technical Component Only
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for performing the CD43 immunostain,
technical component only, in a CLIA-certified laboratory, ensuring
accurate and reproducible staining results for diagnostic purposes.
Responsibility: It is the responsibility of the designated qualified staff
to perform the CD43 immunostaining procedure as outlined in this
SOP. Staff should be competent in immunohistochemical staining
techniques and follow all quality control measures.
1. DEFINITIONS
CD43 Immunostain: An immunohistochemical stain used to identify
CD43 antigen expression in tissue sections.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND HANDLING
• Acceptable Specimens: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded
(FFPE) tissue blocks.
• Unacceptable Specimens: Specimens with inadequate fixation,
inadequately processed tissue, or excessively decalcified
specimens.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Microtome
• Slide dryer
• Staining jars or automated immunostainer (e.g., Ventana, Dako,
Leica)
• Microscope
Reagents:
• CD43 primary antibody
• Secondary antibody detection system (e.g., HRP-conjugated)
• Buffered saline solution (PBS)
• Mounting medium
• Counterstain (e.g., hematoxylin)
• Antigen retrieval solution (e.g., citrate buffer, pH 6.0)
Supplies:
• Positively charged microscope slides
• Coverslips
• Gloves
• Forceps
1. PROCEDURE
A) Tissue Sectioning and Slide Preparation:
1. Cut 4-5 µm thick sections from the FFPE tissue block using a
microtome.
2. Mount the sections onto positively charged microscope slides.
3. Place the slides in a slide dryer or oven at 60°C for 1 hour to
ensure adequate tissue adhesion.
B) Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
1. Deparaffinize the slides by immersing them in xylene or a
xylene substitute for 2 x 5 minutes.
2. Rehydrate the slides through a graded series of ethanol (100%,
95%, 70%) for 3 minutes each, followed by rinsing in distilled
water.
C) Antigen Retrieval:
1. Perform antigen retrieval by placing the slides in a suitable
retrieval solution (e.g., citrate buffer, pH 6.0) and heating them
in a microwave or pressure cooker for 10-20 minutes.
2. Allow slides to cool for 20 minutes at room temperature, then
rinse in PBS.
D) Blocking:
1. Apply a protein-blocking solution (e.g., normal serum or
commercial blocking buffer) to the tissue sections and incubate
for 10 minutes at room temperature to reduce non-specific
binding.
E) Primary Antibody Incubation:
1. Incubate the slides with CD43 primary antibody diluted in
antibody dilution buffer, as per manufacturer's instructions, for
30-60 minutes at room temperature or overnight at 4°C.
2. Rinse slides in PBS to remove unbound primary antibody.
F) Secondary Antibody and Detection:
1. Apply the secondary antibody or detection system (as per
manufacturer's instructions) to the slides and incubate for the
recommended time.
2. Rinse slides in PBS.
G) Chromogen Development:
1. Apply the chromogen substrate (e.g., DAB) to the slides and
monitor the color development under a microscope.
2. Rinse slides in distilled water to stop the reaction once optimal
staining is achieved.
H) Counterstaining:
1. Counterstain the tissue sections with hematoxylin for 1-2
minutes.
2. Rinse slides in running tap water until clear.
I) Dehydration and Mounting:
1. Dehydrate the slides through a graded series of ethanol (70%,
95%, 100%) for 3 minutes each.
2. Clear slides in xylene or xylene substitute for 2 x 5 minutes.
3. Mount coverslips using a suitable mounting medium.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
5. Include positive and negative control slides with each staining
run to ensure the accuracy and specificity of the staining
procedure.
6. Document the results of the control slides and any deviations
from expected results.
7. Review the stained slides under a microscope to ensure the
staining quality and consistency before releasing them to the
pathologist for interpretation.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
Reporting for CD43 immunostain will be performed by the pathologist
based on the stained slides provided. Ensure all patient and sample
identifiers match the requisition form.

5. DOCUMENTATION
Record all aspects of the staining procedure, including reagent lot
numbers, incubation times, date and time, equipment used, and any
deviations or troubleshooting steps taken. Maintain this information in
the laboratory's quality control records.
By following this protocol, the laboratory ensures standardized and
reproducible results for CD43 immunostaining, facilitating accurate
diagnosis and patient care.
