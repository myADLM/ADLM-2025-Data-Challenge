CD45 Leukocyte Common Antigen (LCA) Immunostain Technical
Component Only
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the analytical phase of CD45
Leukocyte Common Antigen (LCA) Immunostain, technical
component only, ensuring accurate identification and localization of
CD45 on leukocytes in tissue sections.
Responsibility:
• Designated histotechnologists and laboratory personnel are
responsible for performing and documenting the
immunohistochemical staining procedure.
• Pathologists are responsible for interpreting the results of the
stain.
1. SPECIMEN
• Acceptable Specimens: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded
(FFPE) tissue blocks or unstained tissue sections on positively
charged slides.
• Unacceptable Specimens: Specimens that are inadequately fixed,
improperly embedded, or show signs of tissue damage.
1. REAGENTS
• Primary Antibody: CD45 (Leukocyte Common Antigen) antibody.
• Secondary Antibody: Anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG polymer-HRP
conjugate.
• Chromogen: 3,3'-Diaminobenzidine (DAB) or suitable substrate-
chromogen system.
• Hematoxylin: Counterstain for nuclei.
• Blocking Reagent: Peroxidase block and protein block solutions.
• Wash Buffer: Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or Tris-buffered
saline (TBS).
1. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
• Microtome for sectioning FFPE tissue blocks.
• Water bath for tissue floatation.
• Drying oven at 60°C.
• Immunostaining workstation or manual staining setup.
• Humidity chamber.
• Coverslips and mounting medium.
1. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation of Tissue Sections:
1. Section FFPE tissue blocks at 4-5 microns.
2. Mount sections on positively charged slides.
3. Bake slides in a drying oven at 60°C for at least 1 hour to
ensure proper adhesion.
B) Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
1. Deparaffinize slides by immersing in three changes of xylene
for 5 minutes each.
2. Rehydrate through graded alcohols (100%, 95%, 70%) for 2
minutes each, followed by running tap water for 5 minutes.
C) Antigen Retrieval:
1. Perform heat-induced epitope retrieval (HIER) using citrate
buffer (pH 6.0) or EDTA buffer (pH 8.0).
2. Heat slides in a microwave, pressure cooker, or steamer
according to reagent manufacturer’s instructions.
3. Allow slides to cool for 20 minutes and rinse in wash buffer.
D) Immunostaining:
1. Outline tissue sections with a hydrophobic barrier pen.
2. Apply peroxidase block solution for 10 minutes to block
endogenous peroxidase activity.
3. Rinse slides in wash buffer.
4. Block non-specific binding with protein block solution for 10
minutes.
5. Incubate slides with primary CD45 antibody for 30-60 minutes
at room temperature or according to manufacturer’s guidelines.
6. Rinse in wash buffer.
7. Apply secondary antibody (polymer-HRP conjugate) for 20-30
minutes.
8. Rinse in wash buffer.
9. Apply chromogen (DAB) and incubate until the desired intensity
is achieved (typically 5-10 minutes).
10. Rinse slides in tap water.
11. Counterstain with hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes.
12. Rinse in running tap water and blue in ammonium hydroxide or
tap water.
E) Dehydration and Mounting:
1. Dehydrate sections through graded alcohols (70%, 95%, 100%)
for 1-2 minutes each.
2. Clear in xylene for 2-3 minutes.
3. Mount coverslips using a compatible mounting medium.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include a positive control tissue known to express CD45 and a
negative control by omitting the primary antibody.
• Document control results and any anomalies or deviations from
the expected staining pattern.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• The pathologist will review and interpret the stained slides.
• Results will be reported as positive or negative for CD45
expression, with localization noted (membranous, cytoplasmic,
etc.).
• Any discrepancies in staining should be addressed and
documented.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions for primary and secondary antibodies.
• Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines for
immunohistochemical staining and analysis.
• Relevant literature and pathology references for the interpretation
of CD45 immunostains.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Staining quality can be influenced by factors such as tissue
fixation, antigen retrieval conditions, and antibody specificity.
• Results should be interpreted in the context of other diagnostic
findings.
This protocol is intended to ensure consistency and reliability in the
analytical phase of CD45 Leukocyte Common Antigen
immunostaining in the laboratory.
