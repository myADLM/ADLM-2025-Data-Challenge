CD49D Cell Expression Evaluation Protocol
1. PURPOSE:
To provide a standardized procedure for the evaluation of CD49D cell
expression using flow cytometry. This protocol applies to the analysis
of cell surface markers in various cell populations, ensuring accuracy,
reliability, and reproducibility of results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY:
Laboratory technologists are responsible for conducting the CD49D
cell expression analysis following this procedure. It is the
responsibility of the section supervisor to ensure proper training,
adherence to protocols, and handling of any procedural issues.
3. SPECIMEN:
Preferred/Acceptable Specimen:
• Peripheral blood collected in EDTA anticoagulant tubes.
• Bone marrow aspirate collected in heparin or EDTA anticoagulant
tubes.
• Tissue biopsy properly disaggregated and prepared as a single-
cell suspension.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed samples.
• Clotted samples.
• Samples not stored or transported under recommended
conditions.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES:
• Flow cytometer with appropriate laser configuration.
• CD49D specific monoclonal antibody conjugated to a
fluorochrome (e.g., FITC, PE, APC, etc.).
• Flow cytometry buffer (e.g., PBS with 2% FBS and 0.1% sodium
azide).
• Isotype-matched control antibodies.
• Calibrated micropipettes and sterile tips.
• Vortex mixer.
• Centrifuge.
• Sample tubes (e.g., polypropylene flow cytometry tubes).
• Proper PPE (gloves, lab coat, eye protection).
5. PROCEDURE:
1. Preparation of Reagents and Equipment:
◦ Verify the integrity and expiration dates of all reagents.
◦ Warm the flow cytometry buffer to room temperature.
◦ Turn on the flow cytometer and perform startup procedures.
2. Sample Preparation:
◦ Mix the specimen gently by inverting the tube.
◦ For peripheral blood or bone marrow, aliquot 100 µL of the
sample into a flow cytometry tube.
◦ For tissue samples, prepare a single-cell suspension by
mechanical or enzymatic dissociation, followed by filtration
to remove clumps.
3. Staining Protocol:
◦ Add 5 µL of CD49D antibody to the sample tube.
◦ Add 5 µL of the appropriate isotype control to a separate
sample tube.
◦ Vortex gently to mix and incubate in the dark at room
temperature for 15 minutes.
4. Washing Steps:
◦ Add 2 mL of flow cytometry buffer to each tube.
◦ Centrifuge at 300 x g for 5 minutes.
◦ Carefully discard the supernatant by decantation without
disturbing the cell pellet.
◦ Resuspend the cell pellet in 500 µL of flow cytometry buffer.
5. Data Acquisition:
◦ Calibrate the flow cytometer using calibration beads
according to manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Acquire data for the stained sample and isotype control.
◦ Set appropriate gates to exclude debris and dead cells by
using forward and side scatter properties of cells.
6. Data Analysis:
◦ Analyze the data using flow cytometry analysis software.
◦ Use isotype control to set the threshold for positive staining.
◦ Quantify the percentage of CD49D positive cells within the
gated population.
◦ Record the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) indicating the
expression level of CD49D.
6. QUALITY CONTROL:
• Run a known positive control sample along with patient samples
to ensure the specificity and sensitivity of the assay.
• Perform routine maintenance and calibration of the flow cytometer
as per manufacturer guidelines.
• Record and archive all raw data, graphs, and analysis results for
quality assurance and future reference.
7. REPORTING RESULTS:
• Results are reported as a percentage of CD49D positive cells and
the MFI value.
• Document all findings in the laboratory information system (LIS).
• Include any deviations from the protocol or issues encountered
during the analysis.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
• Inadequate sample volume or quality may affect the accuracy of
results.
• Variations in sample handling and processing can introduce
inconsistencies.
• Fluorescence overlap from other fluorochromes can impact the
accuracy of data.
