CD4 COUNT FOR IMMUNE MONITORING, BLOOD
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this protocol is to outline the procedure
for the measurement of CD4 T lymphocytes in whole blood samples.
This test is crucial for the monitoring of immune function, particularly
in patients with HIV/AIDS and other immunocompromised conditions.
Responsibility: The designated laboratory personnel are
responsible for performing this procedure, ensuring the accuracy and
reliability of test results. The laboratory supervisor must ensure that
all personnel are appropriately trained and competent in performing
this test.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/Acceptable Specimens:
• Whole blood collected in EDTA (lavender top) tubes.
• Volume: A minimum of 4 mL of whole blood is required for testing.
• Specimens should be kept at room temperature and processed
within 24 hours of collection.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Samples that are clotted or hemolyzed.
• Specimens that have been stored for more than 24 hours post-
collection.
• Blood collected in tubes other than EDTA (e.g., heparinized tubes,
citrate tubes).
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• Flow Cytometer (BD FACSCalibur, BD FACSCanto, or equivalent)
• Sample preparation reagents (BD Tritest CD3/CD4/CD45, BD
FACS Lysing Solution, or equivalent)
• Calibrated pipettes and tips
• Vortex mixer
• Appropriate waste containers for biohazardous material
4. PROCEDURE
A) Sample Preparation:
1. Labeling:
◦ Clearly label the sample tube with the patient’s identification
details.
2. Mixing Sample:
◦ Gently invert the EDTA tube containing the whole blood
sample 8-10 times to ensure proper mixing of the blood.
3. Aliquoting:
◦ Pipette 50 µL of whole blood into the bottom of a 12 x 75
mm polystyrene test tube.
4. Reagent Addition:
◦ Add 20 µL of BD Tritest CD3/CD4/CD45 reagent to the tube.
◦ Vortex the tube gently to ensure thorough mixing.
5. Lysis of Red Blood Cells:
◦ Add 450 µL of BD FACS Lysing Solution to the tube. Mix
well and incubate for 10 minutes at room temperature in the
dark to lyse erythrocytes.
B) Flow Cytometry Analysis:
1. Instrument Setup:
◦ Turn on the flow cytometer and perform daily calibration
using BD Calibrite beads or an equivalent calibration
standard according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Ensure that the appropriate detectors (e.g., FL1, FL2, and
FL3) are set up and that compensation settings are verified.
2. Sample Acquisition:
◦ Vortex the prepared sample tube briefly and place it in the
sample holder of the flow cytometer.
◦ Acquire data until at least 10,000 lymphocyte events are
collected, ensuring the FSC/SSC gating is appropriately set
to include the lymphocyte population.
3. Analysis:
◦ Analyze the data using software specific to the flow
cytometer (e.g., BD FACSDiva, CellQuest Pro).
◦ Identify the CD3+ T lymphocyte population and within this
population, determine the percentage of CD4+ T cells.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform daily instrument quality control using appropriate controls
and calibration beads.
• Include a positive control sample (known to have a reliable count
of CD4 T lymphocytes) with each batch of patient samples to
verify assay performance.
• Document all quality control data and review it before reporting
patient results.
6. RESULT REPORTING
• Calculate the absolute CD4 count as follows: Absolute count = (%
CD4+ T cells / 100) x total lymphocyte count
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS) for
review and verification. Ensure that results comply with the
laboratory’s reference intervals and flag any critical values for
immediate attention by a clinical pathologist.
7. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Reference intervals for CD4 counts will vary based on the
laboratory’s population norms and should be based on
established guidelines and historical data from healthy individuals.
8. TROUBLESHOOTING AND METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to the manufacturer’s instructions for troubleshooting
instrument errors.
• Be aware of potential interferences such as hemolysis, high white
blood cell counts, and sample clotting.
• Method sensitivity and specificity should be verified periodically
according to CLIA standards.
