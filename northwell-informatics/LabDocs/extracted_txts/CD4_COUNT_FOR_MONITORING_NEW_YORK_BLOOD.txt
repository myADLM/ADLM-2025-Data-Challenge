Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for CD4 Count for
Monitoring Using Flow Cytometry
1. PURPOSE
This procedure details the steps for performing CD4 Count for
Monitoring using flow cytometry in the laboratory.
Responsibility:
Designated staff are responsible for performing the CD4 count
testing, including the preparation, operation, and maintenance of the
flow cytometer, as well as ensuring results are accurately recorded
and transmitted to the LIS.
2. SPECIMEN
Specimen Type: Freshly collected whole blood anticoagulated with
EDTA or lithium heparin. If the specimen is collected in ACD, consult
the supervisor for specific instructions.
Specimen Collection:
• Collect the blood sample using standard venipuncture techniques.
• Label the specimen with the patient’s name, date, time of
collection, and unique patient identifier.
• Ensure specimen is mixed thoroughly but gently to avoid
hemolysis.
Specimen Storage and Stability:
• Specimens should be kept at room temperature (20-25°C) and
analyzed within 24 hours of collection.
• Do not refrigerate the specimen as it may affect cell viability.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed samples.
• Specimens with clots.
• Insufficient volume (<2 ml of blood).
• Specimens received in inappropriate containers or without proper
labeling.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS & SUPPLIES
• Flow Cytometer
• CD4 antibody reagent kits (Manufacturer specific, e.g., BD
Biosciences)
• Fluorescence compensation beads
• Sheath fluid
• PBS (Phosphate Buffered Saline)
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes and tips
• Eppendorf tubes or appropriate containers for staining
• Absorbent wipes
4. QUALITY CONTROL
Internal Quality Control:
• Use commercial Control Materials for CD4 count as per
manufacturer’s protocol (e.g., BD Multiset Controls).
• Run the control material daily to ensure accurate performance.
• Record the results of control points and investigate any deviation
from established control ranges.
Calibrator Validation:
• Validate new batches of CD4 antibody kits by running known
control samples to ensure lot-to-lot consistency.
• Record validation data and results to ensure the accuracy of
patient results.
5. PROCEDURE
Sample Preparation:
• Mix the blood specimen thoroughly.
• Aliquot a specified volume of blood (e.g., 50 µL) into a labeled
Eppendorf tube.
• Add the appropriate volume of CD4 antibody reagent (as
specified by the manufacturer).
• Mix gently and incubate for the indicated time (typically 15-20
mins at room temperature, protected from light).
• If required, add lysis solution to remove red blood cells according
to the reagent kit instructions. Incubate as directed, then
centrifuge at 500 x g for 5 mins.
Flow Cytometer Setup and Operation:
• Turn on the flow cytometer and allow it to reach the proper
operating temperature.
• Verify instrument settings, compensation, and calibration using
fluorescence compensation beads.
• Prime the system with sheath fluid and ensure the waste
container is empty.
• Load the prepared sample onto the flow cytometer.
• Run the sample according to established protocol, setting
appropriate gates to ensure accurate discrimination of the CD4
positive cells.
• Record the events in the gated window.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
• Review the generated data for quality and consistency.
• Transmit results to the Laboratory Information System (LIS) for
verification by the designated technologist.
• Results must include CD4 count per microliter of blood and the
percentage of total lymphocytes.
7. SAMPLE INTEGRITY
Review Process:
• Inspect sample preparation to confirm there is no clotting and
adequate staining.
• If there is any indication of hemolysis or abnormal cell scatter,
discuss with the supervisor to determine if the sample needs to be
recollected.
8. CRITICAL RESULTS
If CD4 count falls below critical levels (<200 cells/µL), immediately
notify the ordering physician following the laboratory’s critical value
reporting protocol.

Defined Cell Populations by Flow Cytometry).
10. REVIEW AND APPROVAL
This SOP should be reviewed annually or as needed and approved
by the laboratory director.
Note: This SOP covers general aspects of the CD4 count using flow
cytometry. Specific instrument and reagent guidelines should be
followed per manufacturer's instructions.
