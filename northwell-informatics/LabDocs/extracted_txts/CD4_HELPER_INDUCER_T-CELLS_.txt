Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of CD4
(Helper/Inducer T-Cells) Count by Flow Cytometry
1. PURPOSE
To establish a standardized procedure for the quantitative
determination of CD4 (Helper/Inducer T-cells) in peripheral blood
using flow cytometry. This procedure ensures accurate and reliable
results while maintaining the integrity of the samples and the validity
of the final data.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of designated laboratory personnel to follow the
procedures outlined in this SOP, ensuring proper handling and
processing of samples. The supervisor oversees compliance with the
SOP and addresses any issues that may arise during analysis.
1. DEFINITION
CD4 T-cells are a subset of T-lymphocytes that play a crucial role in
the immune system by aiding other cells in immunologic recognition
and response. Flow cytometry allows for the identification and
quantification of these cells based on their specific surface markers.
1. PROCEDURE
3.1 Sample Preparation
a. Peripheral blood specimens should be collected in EDTA
anticoagulant tubes to prevent clotting. b. Mix the blood gently by
inverting the collection tube several times. c. Specimens must be
analyzed within 24 hours of collection to ensure optimal cell viability.
3.2 Reagents and Supplies
a. Flow Cytometer (equipped with appropriate lasers and detectors)
b. Fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies specific for CD4 (e.g., FITC,
PE-conjugated anti-CD4) c. Lysing solution to remove red blood cells
(lyse buffer containing ammonium chloride) d. Sheath fluid for flow
cytometer e. Calibrated pipettes and tips f. Control samples (positive
and negative controls) g. Data analysis software (e.g., FCS Express,
FlowJo)
3.3 Quality Control
a. Perform daily calibration of the flow cytometer using standard
beads to ensure accurate channel settings. b. Use freshly prepared
lysing solution and check expiration dates and proper storage
conditions for all reagents. c. Include positive and negative control
samples in each run and verify results against established control
values.
3.4 Staining Procedure
a. Dispense 100 µL of whole blood into appropriately labelled flow
cytometry tubes. b. Add 20 µL of fluorochrome-conjugated anti-CD4
antibody to each tube. c. Mix gently by tapping the tube and incubate
for 15 minutes at room temperature in the dark. d. Add 2 mL lysing
solution to each tube to lyse red blood cells. e. Incubate for 10
minutes at room temperature in the dark. f. Centrifuge tubes at 500 ×
g for 5 minutes and discard supernatant. g. Resuspend the cell pellet
in 500 µL of sheath fluid.
3.5 Instrument Setup and Sample Acquisition
a. Set up the flow cytometer according to the instrument manual. b.
Verify that the gating and compensation are correct using control
samples. c. Record the data for each sample run ensuring events are
adequately collected and stored.
3.6 Data Analysis
a. Use appropriate flow cytometry software to analyze the data. b.
Determine the percentage and absolute count of CD4 T-cells using
gating strategy specific for lymphocytes. c. Review and verify data
integrity before reporting results.
3.7 Result Reporting
a. Transfer results to the LIS system. Verify all data entered. b.
Ensure final results include CD4 T-cell percentage and absolute
count (cells/µL). c. Initials, date, and time of analysis must be
documented.
3.8 Troubleshooting
a. If unexpected results are encountered: i. Check reagents and
instrument settings. ii. Review the sample’s pre-analytic conditions.
iii. Notify supervisor and repeat the analysis if necessary. b. Report
any persistent issues to the supervisor for further investigation and
corrective action.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Reference intervals for CD4 T-cells should be established based on
the specific population served by the laboratory and verified
periodically.
