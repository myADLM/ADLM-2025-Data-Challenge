Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for CD4 Immunostain,
Technical Component Only
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the technical steps required for
performing CD4 immunostaining in a CLIA-certified laboratory. This
procedure aims to standardize the process, ensuring accurate and
reproducible results for clinical applications.
RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing,
documenting, and troubleshooting the technical component of the
CD4 immunostaining procedure. The laboratory supervisor ensures
all steps are followed and any deviations are addressed promptly.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred Specimen:
• Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue sections
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Tissue sections that are poorly preserved or show signs of
degradation
• Specimens without proper labeling or documentation
3. REAGENTS AND EQUIPMENT
Reagents:
• Primary anti-CD4 antibody suitable for immunohistochemistry
(IHC)
• Secondary antibody conjugated with HRP (Horseradish
Peroxidase)
• Blocking serum or buffer
• Chromogen substrate (e.g., DAB)
• Counterstain (e.g., hematoxylin)
• Mounting medium
Equipment:
• Microtome
• Slide warmer
• Incubator
• Humidity chamber
• Staining jars or automated staining machine
• Light microscope
4. PROCEDURE
A. Slide Preparation:
1. Cut 3-5 µm thick sections from the formalin-fixed paraffin-
embedded tissue block using a microtome.
2. Place sections on adhesion-charged slides.
3. Heat slides at 60°C for 1 hour or overnight at 37°C to ensure
proper adhesion.
B. Deparaffinization and Rehydration: 4. Dunk slides in xylene for
3 exchanges of 5 minutes each. 5. Immerse slides in 100% ethanol
for 2 exchanges of 3 minutes each. 6. Immerse slides sequentially in
95% and 70% ethanol for 1 minute each. 7. Rinse slides in distilled
water for 3 minutes.
C. Antigen Retrieval: 8. Heat samples in citrate buffer (pH 6.0) or
other suitable antigen retrieval solution using microwave or pressure
cooker method as per antibody manufacturer’s recommendations. 9.
Allow slides to cool to room temperature and rinse in distilled water.
D. Blocking: 10. Incubate slides with blocking serum or buffer for 20
minutes at room temperature to prevent non-specific binding.
E. Primary Antibody Incubation: 11. Apply primary anti-CD4
antibody diluted to the optimized concentration as recommended by
the manufacturer. 12. Incubate slides in a humidity chamber for 1
hour at room temperature or overnight at 4°C.
F. Secondary Antibody Incubation: 13. Rinse slides in PBS or TBS
buffer for 2 exchanges of 5 minutes each. 14. Apply secondary
antibody conjugated with HRP. 15. Incubate slides in a humidity
chamber for 30 minutes at room temperature.
G. Chromogen Development: 16. Rinse slides in PBS or TBS buffer
for 2 exchanges of 5 minutes each. 17. Apply chromogen substrate
(e.g., DAB) to slides. 18. Monitor color development under a light
microscope, typically for 2-10 minutes. 19. Once the desired intensity
is achieved, rinse slides in distilled water.
H. Counterstaining: 20. Immerse slides in hematoxylin for 1-2
minutes. 21. Rinse slides briefly in tap water followed by a quick rinse
in distilled water. 22. If bluing is required, immerse slides in a bluing
solution for 1 minute and rinse again.
I. Mounting: 23. Dehydrate slides by dipping in sequentially in 70%,
95%, 100% ethanol solutions, and then in xylene. 24. Apply mounting
medium and coverslip.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
Internal Quality Control:
• Run positive and negative control slides with each batch of patient
specimens.
• Verify staining quality and specificity using controls prior to
interpreting patient results.
• Document any deviations or issues.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
Results are reviewed by a pathologist or designated technologist
before being entered into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
REFERENCE INTERVALS:
Not applicable for technical component only; pathologist
interpretation required.
7. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Consult the antibody manufacturer’s datasheet for specific limitations
related to the CD4 antibody.
