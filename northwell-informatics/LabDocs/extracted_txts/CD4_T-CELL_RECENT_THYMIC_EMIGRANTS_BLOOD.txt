Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for CD4 T-CELL RECENT THYMIC
EMIGRANTS, BLOOD
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this SOP is to detail the standard
procedures for the analysis of Recent Thymic Emigrants (RTEs)
within the CD4 T-cell population from human blood samples.
2. SCOPE This SOP is applicable to all staff responsible for
performing the analysis of CD4 T-cell RTEs in the immunology
laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITIES
• Technologists: Responsible for performing the assay according to
the procedures outlined and ensuring the integrity and accuracy
of the results.
• Supervisors: Responsible for reviewing the results, providing
guidance during troubleshooting, and ensuring the compliance of
staff with this SOP.
4. SPECIMEN HANDLING
Specimen Requirements:
• Preferred: Fresh whole blood collected in EDTA tubes.
• Volume: 2-5 mL of whole blood.
• Stability: Samples must be processed within 24 hours of collection
if stored at 2-8°C.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Clotted specimens.
• Specimens received beyond 24 hours of collection.
• Hemolyzed specimens.
5. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
• Flow cytometer (e.g., BD FACSCanto II).
• Reagents for surface staining: Antibodies for CD3, CD4, CD45RA,
and CD31.
• PBS (Phosphate-buffered saline).
• FACS Tubes.
• Centrifuge.
• Pipettes and tips.
6. REAGENTS PREPARATION
• All reagents should be prepared according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
• Store all antibodies at the recommended temperature.
• Ensure all reagents are within their expiration date.
7. PROCEDURE
Sample Preparation:
1. Mix the blood sample gently by inverting the tube 8-10 times.
2. Aliquot 100 µL of whole blood into a FACS tube.
Staining Protocol:
1. Add 5 µL of each antibody (CD3, CD4, CD45RA, CD31) to the
tube containing the blood.
2. Vortex gently to mix.
3. Incubate in the dark at room temperature for 15-20 minutes.
Lysis of Red Blood Cells:
1. Add 2 mL of RBC lysis buffer to the tube after staining.
2. Incubate for 10 minutes in the dark at room temperature.
3. Centrifuge the tubes at 300 x g for 5 minutes.
4. Discard the supernatant and wash the cells with 2 mL of PBS.
5. Centrifuge again at 300 x g for 5 minutes.
6. Resuspend the pellet in 300 µL of PBS for acquisition on the
flow cytometer.
Data Acquisition and Analysis:
1. Calibrate the flow cytometer using the appropriate standards
and calibration beads.
2. Acquire at least 100,000 lymphocyte events per sample.
3. Use flow cytometry software (e.g., BD FACSDiva) for data
analysis.
4. Create a lymphocyte gate based on forward scatter (FSC) and
side scatter (SSC).
5. Gate on CD3+CD4+ cells.
6. Within the CD3+CD4+ gate, identify CD45RA+CD31+ cells to
define the recent thymic emigrants.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run daily quality control checks with appropriate QC materials.
Ensure results are within the acceptable range before processing
patient samples.
• Monitor the flow cytometer performance through periodic
calibration and maintenance.
9. RESULT INTERPRETATION
• Analyze the percentage and absolute count of
CD4+CD45RA+CD31+ T-cells using the flow cytometry software.
• Report results following the laboratory’s standard reporting
template.
10. REPORTING RESULTS AND DOCUMENTATION
• Verify results and ensure they are consistent with expected
patterns and controls.
• Enter the results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Document any deviations, instrument issues, or problems
encountered during the analysis.
11. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions for the antibodies and flow cytometer.
• Current literature on CD4 T-cell subsets and immune monitoring.
12. TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDELINES
• If the staining appears faint or inconsistent, check the antibody
integrity and staining protocol.
• If the flow cytometry instrument fails to calibrate, follow the
manufacturer's troubleshooting guide and contact technical
support if necessary.
• Ensure that the RBC lysis and sample washing steps are
conducted thoroughly to avoid high background noise.
13. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS
• Handle all blood specimens following universal precautions.
• Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) including
lab coat, gloves, and safety glasses.
• Dispose of all biohazardous waste according to the laboratory’s
safety guidelines.

By adhering to this SOP, consistent and accurate results for the
analysis of CD4 T-CELL RECENT THYMIC EMIGRANTS can be
generated, contributing to reliable patient diagnostics and research
studies.
