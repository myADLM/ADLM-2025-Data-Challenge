STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP) FOR CD52 CELL
EXPRESSION EVALUATION
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the analytical procedures
required to evaluate CD52 cell expression in patient samples. This
includes the staining, acquisition, and analysis of the samples
through flow cytometry, ensuring accurate and reliable results.
Responsibility:
• All designated laboratory personnel are responsible for adhering
to the procedures outlined in this SOP.
• Supervisors must ensure all procedures are followed correctly
and troubleshoot any issues.
2. DEFINITIONS
CD52: A glycoprotein expressed on the surface of various immune
cells, including lymphocytes, monocytes, and granulocytes.
Flow Cytometry: A technique used to detect and measure physical
and chemical characteristics of a population of cells or particles.
3. PROCEDURE
Sample Preparation
a. Specimen Requirements:
• Preferred/acceptable: EDTA anticoagulated whole blood.
• Unacceptable: Hemolyzed samples, specimens older than 48
hours.
b. Equipment and Reagents:
• Flow cytometer
• CD52 monoclonal antibody (fluorochrome conjugated)
• Isotypic control antibody
• Cell staining buffer
• Red blood cell lysing solution
• Tubes and pipettes
• Vortex mixer
Procedure:
1. Staining and Sample Preparation
a. Prepare tubes for staining:
• Label each tube with the appropriate patient identification.
• Include a tube for the isotype control.
b. Aliquot 100 µL of well-mixed EDTA whole blood into each labeled
tube.
c. Add 10 µL of CD52 monoclonal antibody to the patient sample
tubes.
• For the isotype control tube, add 10 µL of the isotype control
antibody.
d. Vortex the tubes gently and incubate for 15-30 minutes at room
temperature, protected from light.
e. Add 2 mL of red blood cell lysing solution to each tube. Mix
thoroughly and incubate for 10 minutes at room temperature.
f. Centrifuge the tubes at 300 x g for 5 minutes. Discard the
supernatant.
g. Resuspend the cell pellet in 2 mL of cell staining buffer by gently
vortexing.
h. Centrifuge again at 300 x g for 5 minutes and discard the
supernatant.
i. Resuspend the cell pellet in 300 µL of cell staining buffer. The
samples are now ready for flow cytometry analysis.
2. Flow Cytometer Setup and Acquisition
a. Ensure proper calibration of the flow cytometer according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
• Perform daily startup and QC procedures as required.
b. Set up the flow cytometer with appropriate settings for detecting
the fluorochrome used in the CD52 monoclonal antibody.
• Ensure compensation is set correctly and verify settings using
controls.
c. Acquire at least 10,000 events per tube.
3. Analysis
a. Verify the placement of gates to identify lymphocytes, monocytes,
and granulocytes based on forward and side scatter characteristics.
b. Determine the percentage of cells expressing CD52 within each
gate:
• Compare these values against the isotype control to account for
non-specific binding.
c. Ensure the analysis software is correctly configured to produce
histogram and dot plot results of CD52 expression on the cell
population.
4. Reporting Results
Refer to the site-specific reporting guidelines to ensure all data is
accurately and promptly transmitted to the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
• Review and verify the data prior to certification of results.
5. Quality Control
a. Perform quality control procedures periodically as per flow
cytometer manufacturer instructions and standard lab practices.
• This includes daily instrument QC checks, antibody lot validation,
and interlaboratory quality checks.
b. Record QC results in the logbook, and address any deviations
immediately with corrective actions.
REFERENCE INTERVALS
Reference intervals for CD52 cell expression may vary based on the
population studied. Refer to established literature and laboratory-
specific data for determining normal ranges.
LIMITATIONS
• Ensure specimen integrity; hemolyzed or improperly stored
samples can yield unreliable results.
• Ensure proper use of antibodies; incorrect conjugation or
expiration can affect fluorescence signals.
