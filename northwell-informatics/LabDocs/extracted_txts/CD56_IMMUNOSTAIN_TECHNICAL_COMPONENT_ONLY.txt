SOP: Analytical Phase of Generating Results for CD56
Immunostain, Technical Component Only
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to outline the specific steps for
performing the CD56 immunostain, technical component only, to
ensure standardized and accurate results in the laboratory.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory staff to perform
and accurately document all steps of the CD56 immunostain
procedure. Any deviations from the standard procedure must be
reported to a supervisor and corrective action should be documented.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue
sections.
• Section Thickness: 4-5 micrometers.
• Sections should be affixed to positively charged slides to ensure
adherence during the staining process.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Equipment:
◦ Microtome
◦ Water bath
◦ Incubator
◦ Automated slide stainer or manual staining setup
◦ Microscope
• Reagents:
◦ Xylene
◦ Ethanol (100%, 95%, 80%, 70%)
◦ Deionized water
◦ Antigen Retrieval Solution (e.g., citrate buffer pH 6.0 or EDTA
pH 8.0)
◦ Peroxidase Blocking Reagent
◦ Protein Block
◦ Anti-CD56 Primary Antibody
◦ Secondary Antibody
◦ Detection System (e.g., DAB substrate)
◦ Hematoxylin for counterstaining
◦ Mounting Medium
• Supplies:
◦ Positively charged glass slides
◦ Slide racks
◦ Coverslips
4. PROCEDURE
A) Tissue Section Preparation:
1. Sectioning:
◦ Cut 4-5 µm thick sections from the FFPE tissue blocks using
a microtome.
◦ Float the sections on a 40-45°C water bath to flatten them.
◦ Mount the sections on positively charged slides.
◦ Air-dry slides at room temperature for 30 minutes, followed
by incubation overnight at 60°C.
2. Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
◦ Place slides in xylene for 2 x 5 minutes.
◦ Transfer slides through graded ethanol series (100%, 95%,
80%, 70%) for 2 minutes each.
◦ Rinse in deionized water for 2 minutes.
3. Antigen Retrieval:
◦ Place slides in Antigen Retrieval Solution and perform heat-
induced epitope retrieval (e.g., microwave, pressure cooker,
or water bath) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Allow slides to cool at room temperature for 20 minutes.
◦ Rinse in deionized water followed by PBS/TBS wash.
B) Immunostaining:
1. Blocking Endogenous Peroxidase:
◦ Incubate slides with Peroxidase Blocking Reagent for 10
minutes at room temperature.
◦ Rinse in PBS/TBS.
2. Protein Blocking:
◦ Apply Protein Block to the slides and incubate for 10
minutes to block non-specific binding.
◦ Drain or blot off excess.
3. Primary Antibody Incubation:
◦ Apply anti-CD56 primary antibody diluted appropriately
according to manufacturer guidelines.
◦ Incubate in a humidified chamber at room temperature for
60 minutes.
◦ Rinse slides in PBS/TBS.
4. Secondary Antibody Incubation:
◦ Apply secondary antibody and incubate for 30 minutes.
◦ Rinse slides in PBS/TBS.
5. Detection System:
◦ Apply DAB substrate and incubate for 5-10 minutes,
checking for adequate staining under a microscope.
◦ Rinse slides in deionized water.
6. Counterstaining:
◦ Dip slides in hematoxylin for 1 minute for counterstaining.
◦ Rinse in deionized water and blue in slightly alkaline water.
C) Dehydration and Mounting:
1. Dehydration:
◦ Dehydrate slides quickly through ethanol series (70%, 80%,
95%, 100%) - 2 minutes each.
◦ Clear in xylene for 3 x 5 minutes.
2. Mounting:
◦ Apply a drop of mounting medium onto the slide.
◦ Place a coverslip over the slide and air-dry.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include positive and negative controls with each run to ensure
staining specificity and accuracy.
• Record the results of controls in the QC log.
• Review slides under a microscope to verify staining quality.
• Document any deviations and corrective actions taken.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
• Document the staining results in the laboratory information
system (LIS).
• Ensure technical completion and forward the slides to the
pathologist for interpretation.
7. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's protocol for CD56 primary antibody.
• Relevant journal articles and textbooks on immunohistochemistry
and antigen retrieval techniques.
This protocol provides a standardized approach for generating
accurate and reliable CD56 immunostain results, ensuring consistent
practice and quality control in the laboratory.
