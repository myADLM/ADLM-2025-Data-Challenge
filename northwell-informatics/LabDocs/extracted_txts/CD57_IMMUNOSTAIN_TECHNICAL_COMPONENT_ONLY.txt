Standard Operating Procedure: Analytical Phase for CD57
Immunostain, Technical Component Only
1. PURPOSE
To outline the standardized methodology for performing the CD57
immunostain assay, ensuring consistent, accurate, and reproducible
results. This SOP covers the technical component of the analysis.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel trained to perform
the CD57 immunostain assay in the designated CLIA-certified
laboratory.
3. DEFINITIONS
CD57 Immunostain: Immunohistochemistry (IHC) procedure used to
detect CD57 antigen in tissue sections. Technical Component: The
preparation, staining, and initial microscopic examination of the
specimen without interpretation.
4. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the trained histotechnologist or laboratory
technologist to adhere strictly to this SOP for the CD57 immunostain.
The laboratory supervisor must ensure quality control and proper
documentation of all procedures.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Automated IHC stainer (e.g., Ventana, Dako)
• Microtome
• Slide warmer
• Light microscope
Reagents:
• Primary antibody against CD57
• Secondary antibody (HRP-conjugated or comparable)
• Chromogen (e.g., DAB)
• Counterstain (e.g., Hematoxylin)
• Mounting medium
• Positive and negative control slides
Supplies:
• Paraffin-embedded tissue blocks
• Glass slides
• Coverslips
• Reagent containers
• Forceps
6. PROCEDURE
A. Sectioning and Slide Preparation
1. Place the paraffin-embedded tissue block on the microtome.
2. Cut serial sections at 4 µm thickness.
3. Float tissue sections on a water bath at 40-45°C.
4. Mount tissue sections onto glass slides and dry them on a slide
warmer at 37°C for at least 1 hour or overnight at room
temperature.
B. Deparaffinization and Rehydration
1. Heat slides in a 60°C oven for 30 minutes to melt paraffin.
2. Deparaffinize slides by immersing them in xylene for 3 x 5
minutes.
3. Rehydrate slides in a graded ethanol series:
◦ 100% ethanol for 2 x 3 minutes
◦ 95% ethanol for 2 x 3 minutes
◦ 70% ethanol for 1 x 3 minutes
4. Rinse slides in distilled water for 5 minutes to remove ethanol
residue.
C. Antigen Retrieval
1. Perform heat-induced antigen retrieval by placing slides in a
pre-heated retrieval solution (e.g., citrate buffer, pH 6.0) in a
pressure cooker or water bath.
2. Heat for 20 minutes at 95-100°C.
3. Cool slides to room temperature and rinse with distilled water.
D. Immunostaining Procedure
1. Load slides into the automated IHC stainer.
2. Follow the manufacturer's protocol for the application of the
primary antibody against CD57.
3. Incubate with the primary antibody for the recommended time
(usually 30-60 minutes).
4. Apply the secondary antibody (HRP-conjugated or comparable)
according to the manufacturer's instructions.
5. Add the chromogen (e.g., DAB) and incubate until the desired
staining intensity is achieved (usually 5-10 minutes).
6. Counterstain the slides with hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes.
7. Rinse slides with distilled water and dehydrate through graded
ethanol series:
◦ 70% ethanol for 1 minute
◦ 95% ethanol for 1 minute
◦ 100% ethanol for 2 x 1 minute
8. Clear in xylene for 2 x 1 minute.
E. Mounting
1. Apply a drop of mounting medium to the stained tissue section.
2. Place a coverslip over the tissue section and allow to dry.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Run positive and negative control slides with each batch of
CD57 immunostain to ensure accuracy and reproducibility.
2. Review the control slides under a microscope for appropriate
staining (positive control) and absence of staining (negative
control).
3. Document results in the quality control log.
8. RESULTS AND DOCUMENTATION
1. Examine the stained slides under a light microscope.
2. Record the quality and appearance of the staining.
3. For technical component only, the results will not be interpreted
but will be documented with preliminary observations in the
laboratory information system (LIS).
9. TROUBLESHOOTING
If unexpected results occur:
1. Re-examine controls to confirm proper staining.
2. Verify the expiration dates and storage conditions of reagents.
3. Repeat critical steps such as antigen retrieval or primary
antibody application.
4. Document and notify a supervisor for further action.
