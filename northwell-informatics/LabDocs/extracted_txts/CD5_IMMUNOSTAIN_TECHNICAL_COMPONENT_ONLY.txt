Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for CD5 Immunostain -
Technical Component Only
1. PURPOSE
This SOP describes the standardized method for performing the
technical component of CD5 immunostaining in the laboratory. This
includes preparation, staining, and initial quality control of the slides.
The clinical component involving interpretation and reporting of
results is outside the scope of this protocol.
1. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel performing CD5
immunostains in the Histology/Immunohistochemistry (IHC) section
of CLIA-certified laboratories.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
• Laboratory personnel are responsible for following this SOP to
ensure accurate and reproducible staining results.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring staff compliance with
this SOP and addressing any deficiencies.
1. SPECIMEN
• Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue sections cut at 4
microns.
• Unstained slides should be prepared a maximum of 7 days prior
to staining to avoid antigen degradation.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• Autostainer (e.g., Ventana BenchMark XT or equivalent)
• CD5 primary antibody (clone and supplier depend on lab
procurement)
• Detection Kit (specific to the automated stainer)
• Xylene, Ethanol (100%, 95%, 80%)
• Distilled or Deionized Water
• Hematoxylin counterstain
• Coverslipping materials (e.g., mounting medium, coverslips)
• Positive and negative control tissues (ensure they are well
characterized)
1. PROCEDURE
6.1 Pre-Staining Preparation:
a. Quality Control Preparation:
• Select appropriate control slides: positive control (tissue known to
express CD5) and negative control (tissue lacking CD5
expression).
• Controls must be processed with each batch of patient samples.
b. Slide Preparation:
• Sections should be deparaffinized and rehydrated through xylene
and graded ethanol series to water.
6.2 Immunostaining:
a. Deparaffinization:
• Program the autostainer to perform deparaffinization.
b. Antigen Retrieval:
• Perform heat-induced epitope retrieval according to the antibody
manufacturer's recommendations (e.g., citrate buffer, pH 6.0, for
20 minutes).
c. Blocking Steps:
• Apply appropriate blocking solution to minimize nonspecific
binding.
d. Primary Antibody Incubation:
• Apply CD5 primary antibody at the optimized dilution as
recommended by the manufacturer.
• Incubate for the recommended time (e.g., 30 - 60 minutes).
e. Detection:
• Apply detection reagents (secondary antibody conjugated to an
enzyme such as HRP or AP, as provided by the detection kit).
f. Chromogen Development:
• Apply substrate-chromogen solution and monitor for appropriate
color development (e.g., DAB for brown-stained sections).
g. Counterstaining:
• Counterstain with hematoxylin for nuclei visualization.
• Rinse thoroughly in tap water.
6.3 Post-Immunostaining:
a. Dehydration and Clearing:
• Dehydrate sections through graded ethanol series to xylene.
b. Coverslipping:
• Mount sections with mounting medium and coverslips.
6.4 Quality Control
• Each staining run must include a positive control tissue to ensure
staining efficiency and a negative control to check for nonspecific
staining.
• Document control results in the Quality Control log.
7. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If control tissues do not stain as expected, halt further processing
and troubleshoot common issues (e.g., incorrect reagent
preparation, equipment malfunction).
• Consult with a supervisor to determine if repeat staining or new
reagent preparation is required.
8. RECORD KEEPING
• Record all necessary information in the IHC log, including date,
technician, specimen ID, antibody lot, and results of control
tissues.
• Maintain records according to lab policy for potential audits.
9. SAFETY AND HANDLING PRECAUTIONS
• Follow all institutional safety guidelines for handling reagents and
biological specimens.
• Dispose of hazardous waste according to the laboratory’s waste
disposal policies.
10. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's instructions for CD5 antibody and detection kit.
• Institutional guidelines and procedures for immunohistochemistry.
• Relevant literature and regulatory guidelines for immunostaining
best practices.
11. REVIEW AND APPROVAL
• This SOP should be reviewed annually and updated as necessary
to reflect changes in procedures or new information.
