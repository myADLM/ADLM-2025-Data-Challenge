Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase Protocol for CD61 Immunostain, Technical
Component Only
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedure for the analytical
phase of generating results for CD61 immunostaining in the
laboratory. This protocol ensures standardized techniques for the
preparation, staining, and analysis of specimens for accurate and
reliable immunohistochemical (IHC) results.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all CD61 immunostain requests received in
the Histopathology section of the laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Histotechnologists are responsible for performing and
documenting all steps outlined in this procedure.
• Supervisors must ensure adherence to this protocol and address
any deviations.
• It is the responsibility of all staff to identify and report any
deficiencies or issues concerning the immunostaining process.
4. DEFINITIONS
• CD61: Cluster of differentiation 61, also known as integrin β3, a
marker for platelets and megakaryocytes.
• Technical Component Only: This protocol covers only the
technical preparation and staining steps of the
immunohistochemistry process, not the interpretation and
diagnostic component.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Microtome
• Water bath
• Microscope slides
• Positive and negative control slides
• Antigen retrieval system
• Automated or manual IHC stainer
• Primary antibody: CD61
• Secondary antibody and detection system: HRP or AP conjugated
• Chromogen (e.g., DAB)
• Hematoxylin counterstain
• Cover slips and mounting media
• Appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE)
• IHC grade buffers and reagents
6. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Preparation
1. Sectioning:
◦ Cut paraffin-embedded tissue blocks into 3-4 µm thick
sections using a microtome.
◦ Float sections on a water bath set at 40-45°C.
◦ Mount tissue sections on positively charged microscope
slides.
2. Drying:
◦ Dry slides in a 60°C oven for 30 minutes to ensure adhesion
and optimal antigen retrieval.
B. Antigen Retrieval
1. Deparaffinization:
◦ Place slides in xylene for 2x 5 minutes to remove paraffin.
◦ Rehydrate slides through graded alcohols (100%, 95%,
70%) for 2 minutes each.
◦ Rinse slides in distilled water.
2. Heat-Induced Epitope Retrieval (HIER):
◦ Place slides in a preheated antigen retrieval solution (e.g.,
citrate buffer, pH 6.0 or EDTA, pH 9.0).
◦ Heat in a pressure cooker or microwave for 20 minutes at
high power.
◦ Allow slides to cool for 20 minutes at room temperature.
◦ Rinse slides in distilled water followed by Tris-buffered
saline (TBS) or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).
C. Immunostaining
1. Blocking Endogenous Activity:
◦ Treat slides with a peroxidase blocking solution for 10
minutes to quench endogenous peroxidase activity.
◦ Wash slides in TBS or PBS.
2. Primary Antibody:
◦ Incubate slides with CD61 primary antibody at the
manufacturer's recommended dilution for 30 minutes at
room temperature.
◦ Wash slides in TBS or PBS.
3. Secondary Antibody and Detection:
◦ Incubate slides with the appropriate secondary antibody
conjugated to HRP or AP for 30 minutes.
◦ Wash slides in TBS or PBS.
4. Chromogen Development:
◦ Incubate slides with the chromogen (e.g., DAB) for 5-10
minutes or until the desired intensity is reached.
◦ Rinse slides in tap water to stop the reaction.
D. Counterstaining and Mounting
1. Counterstaining:
◦ Counterstain with hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes.
◦ Rinse in tap water.
◦ Differentiate in acid alcohol if required and rinse in tap water.
◦ Blue in ammonia water if necessary.
2. Dehydration and Mounting:
◦ Dehydrate through graded alcohols (70%, 95%, 100%) and
clear in xylene.
◦ Mount slides with permanent mounting media and cover
slips.
E. Quality Control
1. Control Slides:
◦ Include positive and negative control slides with each batch
of patient samples.
◦ Ensure all controls exhibit expected staining patterns before
reporting patient results.
2. Documentation:
◦ Record all relevant data including primary antibody lot
number, incubation times, and any deviations from the
protocol in the laboratory log book.
◦ Document and address any observed discrepancies or
issues immediately.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
• Technical results are to be reviewed by the laboratory supervisor
and prepared for pathologist interpretation.
• Any anomalies or unexpected results are to be reported to the
supervisor immediately for further evaluation.
8. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's instructions for the CD61 primary antibody and
detection system.

9. REVISION HISTORY
• This document is reviewed annually or as needed based on
changes in protocols or instrumentation.
