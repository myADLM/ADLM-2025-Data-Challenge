Standard Operating Procedure
(SOP) for CD68 (KP1)
Immunostain, Bone Marrow,
Technical Component Only
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedures for the analytical
phase of generating results for CD68 immunostaining on bone
marrow specimens, specifically for the technical component. This
ensures that the process is carried out consistently and accurately to
produce reliable and reproducible results.
2. SPECIMEN
Ensure the bone marrow specimen is appropriately collected,
received, processed, and accessioned before beginning the
analytical phase.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the trained Histotechnical staff to perform the
assay following this procedure. Laboratory supervisors are
responsible for overseeing the process, providing guidance as
needed, and ensuring compliance with this SOP.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND
SUPPLIES
• Properly accessioned bone marrow tissue specimens.
• Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) bone marrow tissue
blocks.
• Microtome.
• Water bath.
• Oven/incubator.
• Tissue slides.
• Xylene and ethanol solutions.
• Reagents for antigen retrieval (e.g., citrate buffer, pH 6.0).
• Primary antibody: CD68 (KP1) antibody.
• Secondary antibody and detection system.
• Counterstain (e.g., hematoxylin).
• Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining platform (automated or
manual).
• Microscope and imaging system.
5. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation and Sectioning
1. Sectioning:
◦ Cut 3-4 μm thick sections of FFPE bone marrow tissue
blocks using a microtome.
◦ Float sections on a water bath, and mount on positively
charged slides.
◦ Label slides with patient identifiers and date.
2. Drying:
◦ Dry tissue slides in an oven at 60°C for 30-60 minutes to
ensure complete adhesion.
◦ Allow slides to cool at room temperature before proceeding.
B. Deparaffinization and Rehydration
1. Deparaffinization:
◦ Place slides in a staining rack and immerse in 3 changes of
xylene for 5 minutes each.
2. Rehydration:
◦ Immerse slides in 2 changes of 100% ethanol for 3 minutes
each.
◦ Follow with 1 change each of 95%, 85%, and 70% ethanol,
3 minutes each.
◦ Rinse slides in distilled water for 5 minutes.
C. Antigen Retrieval
1. Antigen Retrieval:
◦ Immerse slides in a pre-warmed antigen retrieval solution
(e.g., citrate buffer, pH 6.0).
◦ Heat slides in a water bath or microwave according to the
protocol for 20-30 minutes.
◦ Allow slides to cool to room temperature, then rinse in PBS
or distilled water.
D. Blocking
1. Blocking:
◦ Apply blocking solution to the tissue sections to block non-
specific background staining. Incubate for 5-10 minutes.
◦ Rinse slides with PBS.
E. Primary Antibody Staining
1. Primary Antibody:
◦ Apply CD68 (KP1) primary antibody to the tissue sections.
Incubate according to the antibody manufacturer’s
recommended incubation time (usually 30-60 minutes at
room temperature).
◦ Rinse slides in PBS.
F. Secondary Antibody and Detection
1. Secondary Antibody:
◦ Apply appropriate secondary antibody (linked to an enzyme
or fluorescent dye) to the tissue sections. Incubate
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Rinse slides with PBS.
2. Signal Detection:
◦ Apply detection reagent, such as DAB (3,3'-
diaminobenzidine) or other chromogen, to visualize the
staining. Incubate until desired staining intensity is achieved
(usually a few minutes, monitored under a microscope).
◦ Rinse slides with distilled water.
G. Counterstaining
1. Counterstaining:
◦ Immerse slides in hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes.
◦ Rinse slides with tap water.
◦ Optionally, perform bluing in a weak ammonia or other
bluing solution.
H. Dehydration and Mounting
1. Dehydration:
◦ Dehydrate slides through graded alcohols (70%, 85%, 95%,
and 100% ethanol) for 3 minutes each.
◦ Clear slides in xylene (3 changes, 5 minutes each).
2. Mounting:
◦ Apply mounting medium, then cover with cover slips.
6. MICROSCOPE EXAMINATION
1. Examination:
◦ Examine stained slides under a microscope to evaluate the
staining of CD68-positive macrophages in the bone marrow
tissue.
◦ Document and image representative fields as needed.
7. DATA RECORDING AND REPORTING
1. Recording:
◦ Document all steps performed on a technical worksheet,
including any deviations from the SOP.
◦ Record stain quality, any issues encountered, and corrective
actions taken.
2. Reporting:
◦ Forward slides and technical worksheet with documented
stain quality to the pathologist for interpretation.
◦ Ensure results are entered into the laboratory information
system (LIS) for pathologist review and final reporting.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Controls:
◦ Include a non-tissue control slide and a positive control
tissue slide with each run.
◦ Ensure control slides exhibit proper staining before
proceeding with patient slides.
2. Troubleshooting:
◦ If controls do not stain correctly, repeat staining for all slides,
troubleshoot protocol discrepancies, and recalibrate
reagents and equipment as needed.
◦ Report persistent issues to the supervisor.
