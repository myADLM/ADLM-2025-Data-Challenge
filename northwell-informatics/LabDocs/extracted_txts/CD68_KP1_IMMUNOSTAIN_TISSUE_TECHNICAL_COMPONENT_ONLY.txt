Standard Operating Procedure: CD68 (KP1)
Immunostain, Tissue, Technical Component Only
1. PURPOSE This SOP outlines the procedure for performing the
technical component of CD68 (KP1) immunostain on tissue
samples. This procedure is to ensure the accurate and reliable
staining necessary for the detection of CD68 antigen in
formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections, which is
typically used to identify macrophages and other CD68-positive
cells for diagnostic or research purposes.
2. SCOPE This procedure applies to all personnel performing the
technical component of CD68 (KP1) immunostain within the
laboratory. It details the steps required from reagent preparation
to staining and quality control of the immunohistochemistry
(IHC) procedure.
3. RESPONSIBILITIES
◦ Laboratory personnel are responsible for performing the
staining procedure according to this SOP.
◦ The laboratory supervisor ensures that personnel are
trained and comply with this SOP.
◦ The quality control department verifies the consistency and
reliability of results.
4. MATERIALS AND REAGENTS
◦ Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue sections
◦ CD68 (KP1) primary antibody
◦ Secondary antibody with detection system (e.g., HRP-
conjugated secondary antibody)
◦ DAB substrate and chromogen solution
◦ Buffer solutions (e.g., PBS)
◦ Blocking solution
◦ Heat-induced epitope retrieval (HIER) reagents
◦ Mounting medium
◦ Slides and coverslips
5. EQUIPMENT
◦ Microtome and water bath for sectioning tissue
◦ Microscope for section examination
◦ Automated or manual IHC staining system
◦ Incubation chambers
◦ Slide drying oven or hot plate
◦ Coplin jars or staining dishes
6. PROCEDURE
A. Slide Preparation
1. Cut 3-5 μm sections from paraffin-embedded tissue
blocks using a microtome.
2. Mount sections on positively charged glass slides.
3. Place slides in a drying oven or hot plate at 60°C for 1
hour to adhere sections to slides.
B. Deparaffinization and Rehydration 4. Deparaffinize slides
by immersing in xylene 2 times for 5 minutes each. 5.
Rehydrate through graded alcohols: 100%, 95%, 70% for 5
minutes each. 6. Rinse slides in deionized water for 5 minutes.
C. Antigen Retrieval 7. Perform heat-induced epitope retrieval
by immersing slides in a preheated retrieval buffer (such as
citrate buffer, pH 6.0) and heating according to buffer
manufacturer’s instructions (commonly 20 minutes in a
microwave or pressure cooker). 8. Allow slides to cool in the
buffer for 20 minutes at room temperature. 9. Rinse slides with
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 5 minutes.
D. Immunostaining Procedure 10. Block endogenous
peroxidase activity by incubating slides in 3% hydrogen
peroxide for 10 minutes. 11. Rinse slides with PBS for 5
minutes. 12. Apply blocking solution to cover sections and
incubate for 10 minutes to prevent non-specific binding. 13.
Incubate sections with primary CD68 (KP1) antibody diluted in
appropriate antibody diluent (refer to antibody datasheet for
suitable dilution) for 60 minutes at room temperature in a
humidified chamber. 14. Rinse slides in PBS for 5 minutes. 15.
Apply suitable secondary antibody (e.g., HRP-conjugated anti-
mouse) and incubate for 30 minutes at room temperature. 16.
Rinse slides in PBS for 5 minutes.
E. Chromogen Development 17. Incubate slides with DAB
substrate and chromogen solution until the desired staining
intensity is achieved (usually 1-5 minutes, monitor visually
under a microscope). 18. Rinse slides in deionized water for 5
minutes.
F. Counterstaining and Mounting 19. Counterstain with
hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes. 20. Rinse slides in running tap
water for 5 minutes. 21. Dehydrate through graded alcohols:
70%, 95%, 100% for 5 minutes each. 22. Clear in xylene 2
times for 5 minutes each. 23. Mount coverslips using a suitable
mounting medium.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Include a positive control tissue known to express CD68 to
ensure the staining procedure is functioning correctly.
◦ Include a negative control without primary antibody to detect
any non-specific binding.
8. TROUBLESHOOTING
◦ Weak/no staining: Check the antibody dilution and
incubation time, ensure proper antigen retrieval.
◦ Non-specific background staining: Increase blocking steps
or adjust antibody dilution.
◦ Improper staining distribution: Ensure even reagent
application and proper section adhesion.
9. REPORTING RESULTS Completed stained slides are reviewed
by a pathologist for interpretation. Technical staff must ensure
all slides are properly labeled and accompanied by appropriate
documentation. Results and observations are recorded
according to laboratory protocols.
