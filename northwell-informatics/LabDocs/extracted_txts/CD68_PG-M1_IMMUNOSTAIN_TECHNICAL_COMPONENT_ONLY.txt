Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) CD68 (PG-M1) Immunostain,
Technical Component Only
1. PURPOSE
This protocol provides the detailed procedure for the technical
component of generating results for CD68 (PG-M1) immunostain in
the laboratory. CD68 (PG-M1) immunostaining is used to identify
macrophages in tissue sections.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the CD68
(PG-M1) immunostain following this protocol. It is the responsibility of
all staff to identify and report any issues affecting test results to the
supervisor.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type:
• Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue sections.
Acceptable Specimens:
• Tissue sections that are well-preserved, with no signs of autolysis
or artifacts.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Tissue sections exhibiting severe artifacts or degradation,
improper fixation, or improper embedding.
1. REAGENTS AND MATERIALS
• Primary Antibody: CD68 (PG-M1) monoclonal antibody.
• Secondary Antibody: Enzyme conjugated anti-mouse antibody.
• Blocking Solution: Protein block.
• Chromogen: Diaminobenzidine (DAB) or equivalent.
• Counterstain: Hematoxylin.
• Positive Control Tissue: Known CD68 expressing tissue.
• Negative Control Tissue: Tissue section without primary antibody.
1. EQUIPMENT
• Microtome.
• Water bath.
• Glass staining dishes.
• Humidity chamber.
• Light microscope.
• Coverslips and mounting media.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation of Tissue Sections
1. Cut tissue sections at 4-5 micrometers thickness using a
microtome.
2. Float sections in a 40°C water bath and mount them onto glass
slides.
3. Dry slides overnight at 37°C.
B. Deparaffinization and Rehydration
1. Deparaffinize sections in xylene for 2 x 5 minutes.
2. Rehydrate sections through graded alcohols—100%, 95%,
70%, and 50%—for 3 minutes each.
3. Rinse in distilled water.
C. Antigen Retrieval
1. Heat tissue sections in antigen retrieval solution in a microwave
or steamer for 30 minutes at 95-100°C.
2. Allow slides to cool to room temperature and rinse in buffer.
D. Blocking
1. Apply blocking solution to tissue sections and incubate for 10
minutes to reduce nonspecific binding.
2. Drain excess blocking solution.
E. Primary Antibody Incubation
1. Apply CD68 (PG-M1) primary antibody to each section.
2. Incubate slides in a humidity chamber for 60 minutes at room
temperature.
3. Rinse slides in buffer three times for 5 minutes each.
F. Secondary Antibody Incubation
1. Apply secondary enzyme-conjugated antibody to each section.
2. Incubate slides in a humidity chamber for 30 minutes at room
temperature.
3. Rinse slides in buffer three times for 5 minutes each.
G. Visualization and Chromogen Development
1. Apply chromogen (DAB) solution to sections and monitor color
development for 1-5 minutes.
2. Stop reaction by rinsing slides in distilled water.
H. Counterstaining
1. Counterstain sections with hematoxylin for 30 seconds.
2. Rinse in tap water until sections are blue.
I. Dehydration and Coverslipping
1. Dehydrate sections through graded alcohols—50%, 70%, 95%,
100%—for 3 minutes each.
2. Clear in xylene for 2 x 5 minutes.
3. Mount sections with coverslips and mounting media.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include positive and negative control tissues in each run to ensure
staining quality and specificity.
• Document results, including control outcomes, in the appropriate
logbook.
• Investigate and resolve any issues with control staining before
reporting patient results.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• The technical staff should review and verify the stained slides
under a light microscope.
• Document the staining intensity and pattern, and any artifacts
observed.
• Notify pathologists for the interpretation of the immunostained
slides.
