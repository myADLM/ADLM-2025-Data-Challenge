Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for CD71 Immunostain,
Technical Component Only
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the procedural steps for the analytical phase of
generating results for CD71 immunostain in a laboratory setting. It
emphasizes the technical component, including specimen
preparation, staining, quality control, and documentation.
RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the laboratory technologists to follow these
procedures accurately and consistently to ensure the reliability and
accuracy of the CD71 immunostain results. Laboratory supervisors
are responsible for overseeing the adherence to this procedure and
addressing any deficiencies.
1. DEFINITIONS
CD71 Immunostain: CD71, also known as transferrin receptor, is a
cell surface receptor highly expressed in proliferating cells, which
makes it useful for identifying erythroid precursors in various tissues.
Technical Component: Refers specifically to the technical execution
of the assay, including specimen handling, staining, and initial
observations.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred Specimens:
• Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks or
unstained tissue sections on charged slides.
• Ensure that all specimens include appropriate identification and
requisition forms.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens that are inadequately fixed, improperly labeled, or
received without necessary documentation will be rejected.
1. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• CD71 primary antibody (specific clone and manufacturer
information should be detailed here)
• Antigen retrieval solution (e.g., citrate buffer, pH 6.0)
• Secondary antibody conjugated with a suitable enzyme (e.g.,
horseradish peroxidase)
• DAB (3,3'-diaminobenzidine) chromogen kit
• Mounting medium
• Hematoxylin counterstain
• Charged microscope slides
• Coverslips
• Control tissue (positive and negative control slides)
1. EQUIPMENT
• Automated immunostaining platform (if applicable)
• Microtome
• Water bath
• Forced-air oven
• Light microscope
• Incubator set to 37°C
• Slide rack and staining jars
1. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation of Specimen Slides:
1. Sectioning:
◦ Cut 3-5 micron sections from the FFPE tissue blocks using
a microtome.
◦ Place sections on charged microscope slides and heat at
60°C for 1 hour to ensure proper adhesion.
B) Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
1. Deparaffinize slides by incubating in xylene for 10 minutes (2
changes).
2. Rehydrate through a graded alcohol series: 100% ethanol (2
changes), 95% ethanol, 70% ethanol, each for 5 minutes.
3. Rinse slides in distilled water for 5 minutes.
C) Antigen Retrieval:
1. Immerse slides in antigen retrieval solution within a pressure
cooker or microwave and heat according to antibody
manufacturer's instructions (usually 10-20 minutes at
95-100°C).
2. Allow slides to cool to room temperature in the retrieval
solution.
3. Rinse slides in distilled water.
D) Blocking and Primary Antibody Application:
1. Block endogenous peroxidase activity by incubating sections in
0.3% hydrogen peroxide for 10 minutes.
2. Apply primary CD71 antibody to each section and incubate in a
humidified chamber at room temperature for 30-60 minutes or
as per manufacturer's instructions.
E) Secondary Antibody Application:
1. Rinse slides in buffer solution (PBS or TBS) for 5 minutes.
2. Apply appropriate secondary antibody and incubate in a
humidified chamber for 20-30 minutes.
F) Chromogen Development:
1. Rinse slides again in buffer solution.
2. Apply DAB chromogen and incubate until the desired staining
intensity is achieved (typically 5-10 minutes).
3. Rinse slides in distilled water.
G) Counterstaining:
1. Counterstain with hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes.
2. Rinse in tap water and then blueing solution (e.g., ammonia
water) briefly.
H) Dehydration and Mounting:
1. Dehydrate through a graded alcohol series: 70% ethanol, 95%
ethanol, 100% ethanol, each for 5 minutes.
2. Clear in xylene for 5 minutes (2 changes).
3. Mount using a suitable medium and coverslip.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run positive and negative tissue controls with each batch of
slides. Positive controls should show expected CD71 staining,
and negative controls should lack specific staining.
• Review control slides before releasing results.
1. DOCUMENTATION
• Record all steps and observations in the laboratory information
system (LIS) or manual logbook, including any deviations from the
standard procedure.
• Document reagent and antibody lot numbers, slide identifiers, and
quality control results.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's instructions for primary and secondary antibodies.
• Relevant peer-reviewed articles and protocols on CD71
immunostaining.
• Internal laboratory manuals and guidelines.
This SOP ensures the standardization and reliability of the CD71
immunostain results in the laboratory, contributing to accurate
diagnostic interpretations.
