Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase for Generating Results for CD79A
Immunostain, Technical Component Only
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this procedure is to provide a
detailed step-by-step guide for performing CD79A
immunostaining on tissue sections, ensuring consistent and
reliable results for the technical component only.
2. SCOPE This procedure applies to all designated laboratory
personnel responsible for performing CD79A immunostaining
for clinical or research purposes. The procedure does not cover
interpretation of results but only the technical staining process.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• All designated laboratory personnel trained in
immunohistochemistry are responsible for performing CD79A
immunostaining.
• The laboratory supervisor is responsible for ensuring personnel
are appropriately trained and the equipment is functioning
correctly.
1. SPECIMEN
• Acceptable specimens: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded
(FFPE) tissue sections.
• Unacceptable specimens: Fresh or improperly fixed tissues.
1. REAGENTS, EQUIPMENT, AND SUPPLIES
• Primary antibody: Anti-CD79A antibody
• Secondary antibody: Appropriate anti-mouse or anti-rabbit
antibody
• Detection system: DAB (3,3'-diaminobenzidine) chromogen/
substrate system
• Counterstain: Hematoxylin
• Dewaxing agent (e.g., xylene)
• Rehydration solutions (e.g., graded ethanol series)
• Antigen retrieval solution (e.g., citrate buffer pH 6.0)
• Wash buffers (e.g., PBS or TBS)
• Mounting medium
• FFPE tissue sections mounted on positively charged slides
• Automated immunostainer or manual staining supplies
1. PROCEDURE A. Preparation and Pre-Treatment
2. Preheat the water bath to 95-100°C for antigen retrieval.
3. Load tissue sections into the automated immunostainer or
prepare for manual staining.
B. Deparaffinization and Rehydration
1. Immerse slides in xylene or alternative dewaxing agent, 3
changes, 5 minutes each.
2. Rehydrate through graded ethanol series: 100%, 95%, 85%,
70%, and distilled water, 3 minutes each.
C. Antigen Retrieval
1. Submerge slides in antigen retrieval solution.
2. Place in preheated water bath for 20 minutes.
3. Allow slides to cool at room temperature for 20 minutes.
4. Rinse slides in distilled water.
D. Immunostaining (Automated or Manual)
1. Apply primary antibody (Anti-CD79A) and incubate for the
recommended time (usually 30-60 minutes).
2. Rinse slides in wash buffer 2-3 times, 5 minutes each.
3. Apply secondary antibody and incubate for the recommended
time (usually 20-30 minutes).
4. Rinse slides in wash buffer 2-3 times, 5 minutes each.
5. Apply DAB chromogen solution and incubate for 5-10 minutes
or until desired stain intensity is achieved.
6. Rinse slides in distilled water.
E. Counterstaining
1. Immerse slides in hematoxylin for 2-3 minutes.
2. Rinse in running tap water for 5 minutes.
3. Optionally, dip slides in 0.1% HCl ethanol for 10 seconds and
rinse in running water to differentiate.
4. Dehydrate slides through graded ethanol series: 70%, 85%,
95%, 100%, 2 minutes each.
5. Clear in xylene, 2 changes, 5 minutes each.
F. Mounting
1. Apply mounting medium and cover slip.
2. Allow slides to dry.
3. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include positive and negative control slides with each staining run.
• Document all steps and any deviations from the standard
protocol.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Review stained slides to ensure staining quality.
• Issue a technical report confirming that the CD79A staining
procedure has been completed, specifying any deviations or
issues encountered.
• Forward slides to the pathologist or designated personnel for
interpretation.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s guidelines for Anti-CD79A antibody.
• Laboratory’s internal quality assurance policies.
