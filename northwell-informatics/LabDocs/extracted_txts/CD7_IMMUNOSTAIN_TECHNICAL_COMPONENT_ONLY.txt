Protocol for CD7 Immunostain, Technical Component Only
1. PURPOSE
This procedure outlines the steps and guidelines for performing the
CD7 immunostain, technical component only, to ensure consistent
and accurate results in pathology laboratory testing.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
• Designated histotechnologists/technicians are responsible for
performing the CD7 immunostain according to this protocol.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring that staff are trained on
this protocol and for addressing any procedural deficiencies.
1. DEFINITION
CD7 is a differentiation antigen found on T-cells and natural killer
(NK) cells. It is used in immunohistochemistry to identify cells of T-cell
origin.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Microtome
• Water bath
• Coplin jars
• Staining racks
• CD7 primary antibody (commercially sourced and validated)
• Secondary antibody (specific to the primary antibody host
species)
• Detection system (e.g., DAB substrate kit)
• Positively charged slides
• Antigen retrieval solutions (e.g., citrate buffer, pH 6.0)
• Blocking solution
• Mounting medium
• Coverslips
• Positive and negative control tissues
• Humidity chamber
• Immunostainer (optional)
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND PREPARATION
• Tissue sections should be formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded.
• Cut sections approximately 4-5 micrometers thick using a
microtome.
• Place sections on positively charged slides.
1. PROCEDURE
A) Slide Preparation
1. Deparaffinize slides in three changes of xylene, 5 minutes each.
2. Rehydrate slides through a series of graded alcohols (100%,
95%, 70%), 5 minutes each.
3. Rinse slides in tap water for 5 minutes.
B) Antigen Retrieval 4. Perform antigen retrieval in a citrate buffer
(pH 6.0) by heating slides in a microwave, pressure cooker, or water
bath for 20 minutes. 5. Cool slides to room temperature. 6. Rinse
slides in distilled water for 5 minutes.
C) Blocking 7. Place slides in a humidified chamber. 8. Apply
blocking solution to each section to prevent non-specific binding.
Incubate for 20 minutes at room temperature.
D) Primary Antibody Incubation 9. Drain off the blocking solution.
10. Apply the CD7 primary antibody to each section (at the dilution
recommended by the manufacturer). 11. Incubate for 60 minutes at
room temperature or overnight at 4°C in a humidity chamber.
E) Washing 12. Wash slides in PBS buffer, 5 minutes each (3
washes).
F) Secondary Antibody Incubation 13. Apply the appropriate
biotinylated secondary antibody (or HRP-conjugated secondary
antibody if a non-biotin system is used). 14. Incubate for 30 minutes
at room temperature in a humidity chamber.
G) Washing 15. Wash slides again in PBS buffer, 5 minutes each (3
washes).
H) Detection 16. Apply the detection reagent (e.g., DAB substrate
solution) and incubate for the recommended time (usually 5-10
minutes). 17. Monitor the development of the chromogen visually
under the microscope.
I) Counterstaining 18. Rinse slides in tap water. 19. Counterstain
with hematoxylin for 1 minute. 20. Rinse slides in tap water.
J) Dehydration and Mounting 21. Dehydrate slides through a series
of graded alcohols (70%, 95%, 100%), 5 minutes each. 22. Clear
slides in xylene, 5 minutes each (2 changes). 23. Apply mounting
medium and coverslip.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include positive and negative control slides with each staining run.
• Positive control: Tissue known to express CD7.
• Negative control: Tissue known not to express CD7, omitting the
primary antibody for one section.
• Document all steps, including any deviations from the standard
protocol.
• Review and validate results by a pathologist before reporting.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
For the technical component only, forward the stained slides to the
pathologist for analysis. Ensure that slides are labeled correctly with
patient identifiers and control slide information.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
N/A for the technical component only.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Optimal staining is dependent on proper fixation and processing
of tissue specimens.
• Variability in antigen expression can occur between different types
of tissues and different patients.
