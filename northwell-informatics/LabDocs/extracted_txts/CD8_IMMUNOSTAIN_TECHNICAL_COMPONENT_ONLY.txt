Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for CD8 Immunostaining -
Technical Component Only
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the process for performing CD8
immunostaining. This covers the technical aspects only, ensuring
consistent and accurate staining of CD8 markers for subsequent
interpretation by pathologists.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the
immunostaining procedure according to this SOP. All staff must
ensure the integrity and quality of the staining process and report any
discrepancies or issues to the supervising pathologist.
1. REAGENTS AND EQUIPMENT
• CD8 Primary Antibody (Ready-to-use or concentrated form
requiring dilution)
• Secondary Antibody (Linked to detection system)
• Detection System (e.g., HRP or AP system)
• Substrate-Chromogen Solution (e.g., DAB or Permanent Red)
• Blocking Solution
• Appropriate positive and negative control tissues
• Xylene (for deparaffinization)
• Ethanol (for rehydration)
• Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS) (for washing)
• Staining dishes
• Cover slips
• Microscope
• Incubation chamber (37°C)
• Slides (pre-prepared with tissue sections)
1. PROCEDURE
a) Preparation of Slides:
1. Deparaffinization:
◦ Place tissue slides in xylene for 2x5 minutes to remove
paraffin.
◦ Rehydrate through graded ethanol solutions (100%, 95%,
85%, 70%) for 3 minutes each, followed by a rinse in
distilled water.
2. Antigen Retrieval:
◦ Perform antigen retrieval using citrate buffer (pH 6.0) or
EDTA buffer (pH 8.0) in a pressure cooker, microwave, or
steamer as per kit instructions.
◦ Allow slides to cool for 20 minutes at room temperature
before proceeding.
b) Immunostaining Protocol:
1. Blocking:
◦ Incubate slides with blocking solution for 10-15 minutes at
room temperature to prevent non-specific binding.
2. Primary Antibody Incubation:
◦ Incubate slides with CD8 primary antibody for 30-60 minutes
at room temperature or as specified by the manufacturer's
instructions.
◦ Rinse slides with PBS (3x5 minutes).
3. Secondary Antibody Incubation:
◦ Incubate slides with secondary antibody linked to the
detection system for 30 minutes at room temperature.
◦ Rinse slides with PBS (3x5 minutes).
4. Detection System and Chromogen:
◦ Apply substrate-chromogen solution (e.g., DAB or
Permanent Red) and monitor development under a
microscope.
◦ Once adequate staining is achieved (usually 5-10 minutes),
rinse in distilled water to stop the reaction.
c) Counterstaining: - Counterstain slides with hematoxylin if desired
for a defined nuclear background. - Dip slides in distilled water to
remove excess hematoxylin and blueing reagent until desired
intensity is achieved.
d) Mounting: - Dehydrate slides through graded ethanol solutions
(70%, 95%, 100%) followed by two changes of xylene. - Apply a
cover slip using a mounting medium appropriate for the chromogen
used (e.g., DPX for DAB).
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Verify staining quality using positive and negative control tissues.
• Ensure uniform staining and absence of non-specific background
staining.
• Document the staining run, including any anomalies observed.
1. RESULTS REPORTING
As this SOP covers the technical component only, the stained slides
will be handed over to the designated pathologist for interpretation
and diagnosis.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Positive control tissues showing CD8 positive cells should exhibit
strong, specific staining in the expected locations (e.g., lymphocytes
in lymphoid tissues).
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Following limitations should be noted:
• The specificity and sensitivity can vary depending on the antibody
source and tissue type.
• Inconsistent antigen retrieval can lead to variability in staining
intensity.
• Non-specific binding may occur if blocking steps are inadequate.
