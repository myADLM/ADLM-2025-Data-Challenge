Protocol for Analytical Phase of Generating Results for CD8 T-
Cell Immune Competence, Global, Blood
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to delineate the steps involved in
the accurate and reliable analysis of CD8 T-Cell Immune
Competence in blood samples. This will ensure the consistency,
reliability, and traceability of results, which are of critical importance in
immunological assessments.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory staff are responsible for adhering to the
protocol outlined in this document.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring the adherence to the
protocol and addressing any discrepancies or issues reported by
the staff.
1. DEFINITION
CD8 T-Cell Immune Competence refers to the functionality and
activity level of CD8+ T cells, which are crucial for immune response,
particularly in identifying and destroying infected or cancerous cells.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Flow cytometer (multi-parameter capable)
• Fluorescently-labeled antibodies (e.g., Anti-CD3, Anti-CD8, Anti-
CD45)
• Appropriate isotype controls
• Lysing solution (OptiLyse C or equivalent)
• Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)
• Fixative solution (1% paraformaldehyde in PBS)
• Sample tubes (12 x 75 mm polystyrene tubes)
• Calibrated pipettes and tips
• Vortex mixer
• Centrifuge capable of handling sample tubes
• Deionized water
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred specimen: Peripheral blood drawn into an EDTA
(lavender top) tube.
• Volume required: 5 mL of freshly collected whole blood.
• Specimen stability: Process specimens within 24 hours of
collection. If immediate processing is not possible, store
specimens at 2-8°C and ensure they are processed within 24
hours to preserve cell integrity.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed samples
• Clotted samples
• Specimens received >24 hours post-collection
• Specimens without proper identification or requisition information
1. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation
1. Thaw and Prepare Reagents:
◦ Ensure that all reagents are prepared and brought to room
temperature before starting the procedure.
2. Cell Staining:
◦ Label 12 x 75 mm sample tubes appropriately.
◦ Add 100 µL of whole blood into each tube.
◦ Add 10 µL of the fluorescently-labeled antibodies to the
blood sample in each tube.
◦ Vortex gently to mix and incubate at room temperature in
the dark for 15 minutes.
3. RBC Lysis and Cell Washing:
◦ Add 2 mL of lysing solution to each tube. Vortex gently and
incubate for 10 minutes in the dark at room temperature.
◦ Centrifuge the tubes at 500 x g for 5 minutes at room
temperature.
◦ Carefully aspirate the supernatant without disturbing the cell
pellet.
◦ Resuspend the pellet in 1 mL of PBS, vortex gently, and
centrifuge at 500 x g for 5 minutes.
◦ Repeat the wash step twice more.
4. Cell Fixation:
◦ After the final wash, resuspend the pellet in 500 µL of 1%
paraformaldehyde in PBS.
◦ Vortex gently and store at 2-8°C in the dark until analysis.
Analyze within 24 hours.
B. Flow Cytometry Analysis
1. Instrument Setup:
◦ Turn on the flow cytometer and allow it to stabilize.
◦ Perform daily instrument quality control using calibration
beads as per manufacturer's instructions.
◦ Set up compensation controls using single-stained samples.
2. Running Samples:
◦ Run unstained and singly stained controls to set up the
gates and compensation.
◦ Acquire data for at least 10,000 lymphocyte events per
sample.
3. Data Acquisition and Analysis:
◦ Use flow cytometry software for data acquisition, ensuring
correct gating for lymphocytes, and specifically CD3+CD8+
T cells.
◦ Record the percentage and absolute count of CD8+ T cells.
◦ Analyze the functionality markers as specified (e.g.,
activation markers like CD69 or CD25).
4. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run known positive and negative control samples alongside
patient samples.
• Periodically verify antibody staining efficacy and fluorescent
channel performance.
• Document any deviations or issues encountered during the
procedure and notify the supervisor immediately.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Review and verify acquired data.
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
including the percentage and absolute count of CD8+ T cells.
• Flag any abnormal results for the supervisor's review.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Normal ranges for CD8+ T cell counts and percentages are
method and population specific. Typically:
◦ Absolute counts: 200-900 cells/µL
◦ Percentage of total T cells: 20-40%
◦ Reference intervals should be validated and documented
according to local population data.

10. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Interference due to hemolysis, clotting, or delays in sample
processing may affect results.
• Ensure that samples are stained and analyzed within
recommended time frames to minimize cell degradation.
11. DOCUMENTATION AND RECORD-KEEPING
• Maintain records of specimen processing, instrument quality
control, and raw data.
• Ensure all results and corrective actions are logged accurately.
