CD8 T-CELL IMMUNE COMPETENCE PANEL, GLOBAL, WHOLE
BLOOD
1. PURPOSE
To provide instructions for the standardized analysis and reporting of
the CD8 T-Cell Immune Competence Panel in whole blood
specimens, ensuring accurate and reliable test results.
Responsibility:
All laboratory personnel performing the CD8 T-Cell Immune
Competence Panel assay must follow these instructions. The
laboratory supervisor is responsible for ensuring compliance with this
protocol and addressing any issues that arise during the analytical
process.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/Acceptable Specimen:
• Whole blood collected in an EDTA anticoagulated tube.
• Specimens should be processed within 24 hours of collection if
kept at room temperature. If processing is delayed beyond 24
hours, specimens should be stored at 2-8°C and processed within
48 hours.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Clotted blood samples.
• Specimens older than 48 hours.
• Specimens that have not been stored under appropriate
conditions.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Flow cytometer equipped with appropriate lasers and detectors.
• Fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies specific for CD8 markers.
• Buffered saline solution (BSS).
• Red blood cell lysis buffer (if applicable).
• Flow cytometry tubes.
• Vortex mixer.
• Centrifuge.
• Calibration beads for flow cytometer calibration.
• Personal protective equipment (PPE).
4. PROCEDURE
Sample Preparation:
1. Collect the whole blood specimen in an EDTA tube.
2. Label the flow cytometry tubes with patient identification.
3. Add 100 µL of whole blood to each flow cytometry tube.
Staining Procedure:
1. Add the appropriate volume of fluorochrome-conjugated
antibodies specific for CD8 markers to each tube. Follow the
manufacturer's recommended dilutions.
2. Incubate the mixture in the dark at room temperature for 20
minutes.
3. Wash the cells by adding 2 mL of buffered saline solution (BSS)
to each tube.
4. Centrifuge at 300g for 5 minutes at room temperature.
5. Decant the supernatant carefully without disturbing the cell
pellet.
6. If using red blood cell lysis buffer, add the buffer to the cell
pellet, incubate according to the manufacturer's instructions,
and then wash the cells again with BSS.
Flow Cytometry Analysis:
1. Resuspend the stained cells in 500 µL of BSS.
2. Calibrate the flow cytometer using calibration beads according
to the manufacturer’s instructions.
3. Adjust the settings of the flow cytometer (e.g., laser voltages,
compensation) using control samples.
4. Acquire data from the patient samples, ensuring at least 10,000
CD8+ events are collected per sample.
5. Save the data and export it for analysis.
Data Analysis:
1. Use flow cytometry analysis software to analyze the acquired
data.
2. Identify and gate the CD8+ T-cells based on scatter properties
and marker expression.
3. Export the numerical data quantifying the percentage and
absolute count of CD8+ T-cells.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
Internal Quality Control:
1. Include a known positive control and a negative control sample
with each batch of patient specimens.
2. Analyze these control samples to ensure proper performance of
the assay.
3. Document the results of control samples in the Quality Control
log. The assay batch is valid only if the control results fall within
the established acceptable ranges.
Flow Cytometer Maintenance and Calibration:
1. Perform daily startup, calibration, and quality control checks of
the flow cytometer as per the manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Record any deviations and corrective actions in the instrument
maintenance log.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Review the analyzed data for consistency and accuracy.
2. Verify that the results of the patient samples are within the
expected reference ranges.
3. Document any unusual findings or technical issues
encountered during the analysis.
4. Transmit results to the Laboratory Information System (LIS) for
review and verification by the technologist.
7. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s protocols for flow cytometer maintenance,
calibration, and antibody usage.
• CLSI guidelines for flow cytometry.
• Relevant scientific literature on CD8 T-cell immunophenotyping.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Accurate identification of CD8+ T-cells may be affected by
suboptimal specimen quality, improper staining, or instrument
calibration issues.
• The assay is limited by the specificity and sensitivity of the
fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies used.
9. PROCEDURE REVIEW
This protocol is subject to review and revision annually or as needed
to incorporate new techniques, technologies, or guidelines.
