Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Analytical Phase of Generating Results for CD99
(MIC-2) Immunostain, Technical Component Only
1. PURPOSE
To detail the procedure for processing and staining tissue specimens
with CD99 (MIC-2) antibody for immunohistochemical analysis. This
SOP is intended for the technical component only, encompassing
sample preparation, staining, and quality control protocols. Results
interpretation and reporting are excluded and covered under a
separate SOP for the pathologist.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of trained laboratory personnel to ensure all
procedures are followed accurately and all documentation is
completed. Any deviation or error must be reported to the supervisor
immediately.
3. DEFINITIONS
• CD99 (MIC-2): A cell surface protein used as an
immunohistochemical marker for certain soft tissue tumors and
other malignancies.
• Immunostaining: A technique used to detect specific antigens in
tissue sections by utilising targeted antibodies bound to labels
that produce a colour reaction.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Equipment:
◦ Microtome
◦ Water bath
◦ Slide warmer
◦ Immunostainer
◦ Microscope
• Reagents:
◦ CD99 (MIC-2) primary antibody
◦ Secondary antibody
◦ Detection reagent (e.g., DAB)
◦ Mounting medium
◦ Xylene
◦ Ethanol (100%, 95%, 70%)
◦ Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)
◦ Hematoxylin
◦ Eosin
◦ Hydrogen peroxide
• Supplies:
◦ Positive and negative control tissue slides
◦ Cover slips
◦ Glass slides
◦ Absorbent wipes
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND PREPARATION
• Specimen Requirements:
◦ Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue blocks.
◦ Unstained tissue sections, ideally 3-4 microns thick, mounted
on positively charged slides.
• Specimen Preparation:
1. Cut 3-4 μm sections from the paraffin block using a
microtome.
2. Float sections on a water bath (40-45°C) and mount them
onto positively charged glass slides.
3. Place slides on the slide warmer at 60°C for 30-60 minutes
to ensure proper adhesion of the tissue.
6. PROCEDURE
A) Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
1. Deparaffinize slides by immersing them in xylene: 3x for 5
minutes each.
2. Rehydrate slides through graded ethanol series: 100% ethanol:
2x for 3 minutes each, 95% ethanol: 2x for 3 minutes each,
70% ethanol: 1x for 3 minutes, and finally rinse in distilled water
for 5 minutes.
B) Antigen Retrieval:
1. Perform heat-induced epitope retrieval (HIER) using a suitable
retrieval buffer (e.g., citrate buffer pH 6.0 or EDTA buffer pH
9.0).
2. Heat slides in the retrieval solution using a microwave, pressure
cooker, or water bath at 95-100°C for 20-30 minutes.
3. Allow slides to cool for 20 minutes at room temperature and
then rinse in PBS or distilled water.
C) Immunostaining:
1. Blocking:
◦ Incubate slides with 3% hydrogen peroxide for 10 minutes to
block endogenous peroxidase activity.
◦ Wash slides with PBS for 5 minutes.
2. Primary Antibody Incubation:
◦ Apply CD99 (MIC-2) primary antibody to the sections.
◦ Incubate for 30-60 minutes at room temperature or
overnight at 4°C, depending on antibody specifications.
◦ Rinse slides in PBS 3 times for 2 minutes each.
3. Secondary Antibody Incubation:
◦ Apply secondary antibody (according to manufacturer’s
instructions).
◦ Incubate for 30 minutes at room temperature.
◦ Rinse slides in PBS 3 times for 2 minutes each.
4. Detection:
◦ Apply detection reagent (e.g., DAB) and incubate until the
desired color intensity is achieved (usually 5-10 minutes).
◦ Rinse in distilled water.
5. Counterstaining:
◦ Counterstain with hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes.
◦ Rinse in running tap water for 5 minutes.
◦ (Optional) Perform eosin counterstaining as required.
◦ Dehydrate through 70%, 95%, and 100% ethanol, followed
by xylene: each step for 2 minutes.
D) Mounting:
1. Apply a small drop of mounting medium to the slide.
2. Cover with a cover slip.
3. Allow slides to dry completely before microscopic evaluation.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Control Slides:
◦ Include known positive and negative tissue control slides in
each staining run to validate the staining procedure.
◦ Assess control slides to ensure the proper staining procedure
before reviewing patient slides.
• Documentation:
◦ Document the date, time, tech initials, and observations for
control slides and patient specimens in the laboratory logbook.
• Troubleshooting:
◦ If staining is weak or non-specific, review antibody
concentration, incubation times, and antigen retrieval protocol.
◦ Repeat staining procedure if necessary, ensuring all
equipment and reagents are functioning properly.
8. RESULTS INTERPRETATION AND REPORTING
Interpretation of stained slides and subsequent reporting are
performed by qualified pathologists, as outlined in the separate SOP
for clinical diagnostics. Technical staff should ensure slides are
properly labeled and organized for pathologist review.

secondary antibodies.
