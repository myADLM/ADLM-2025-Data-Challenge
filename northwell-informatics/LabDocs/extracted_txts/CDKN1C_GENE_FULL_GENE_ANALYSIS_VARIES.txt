Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for CDKN1C GENE, FULL
GENE ANALYSIS
1. PURPOSE:
The purpose of this Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is to
provide a detailed and standardized process for the full gene analysis
of CDKN1C (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor 1C) in clinical
specimens. This includes the preparation, amplification, sequencing,
and interpretation of data to ensure accurate and reliable results.
2. RESPONSIBILITIES:
It is the responsibility of all laboratory staff conducting the CDKN1C
gene analysis to adhere to this SOP strictly to maintain the integrity
and quality of the results. Any deviation from the SOP must be
documented and approved by the laboratory supervisor.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS:
• Preferred Specimen Type: Peripheral blood, minimum of 3-5 ml
collected in EDTA tube.
• Alternate Specimen Type: Saliva, buccal swabs, or extracted
DNA with a minimum concentration of 20 ng/μL.
• Stability: Blood samples are stable for 72 hours at room
temperature; extracted DNA samples are stable at -20°C up to
one year.
4. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS:
• PCR Thermocycler (ABI 9700 or equivalent)
• DNA Sequencer (e.g., Illumina MiSeq or equivalent)
• qPCR Machine
• Thermal Cycler
• DNA extraction kits (Qiagen or equivalent)
• PCR master mix (e.g., Promega GoTaq)

guidelines.
• Assess DNA quality and quantity as above.
5.2. PCR Amplification
5.2.1 Primer Design:
• Design primers to amplify the regions of interest within the
CDKN1C gene ensuring coverage of all coding sequences and
splice sites.
5.2.2 PCR Conditions:
• Prepare PCR mix (total volume 25 μL):
◦ PCR Master Mix: 12.5 μL
◦ Forward Primer (10 μM): 1 μL
◦ Reverse Primer (10 μM): 1 μL
◦ Template DNA: 2 μL (20 ng/μL)
◦ Nuclease-free water: 8.5 μL
5.2.3 Cycling Conditions:
• Initial Denaturation: 95°C for 5 min
• Denaturation: 95°C for 30 sec
• Annealing: 58°C for 30 sec (temperature may be adjusted based
on primer Tm)
• Extension: 72°C for 1 min (Repeat steps for 35 cycles)
• Final Extension: 72°C for 7 min
5.2.4 Gel Electrophoresis:
• Run 5 μL of PCR product on a 1.5% agarose gel to confirm
amplification.
5.3. Sequencing
5.3.1 Purification of PCR products:
• Purify PCR products using Qiagen PCR purification kit.
5.3.2 Preparation for Sequencing:
• For Sanger sequencing, prepare sequencing reaction with the
BigDye Terminator kit as per the manufacturer's protocol.
• For NGS, prepare libraries according to the Illumina library
preparation protocols.
5.3.3 Sequencing Run:
• Load samples onto sequencer (e.g., ABI 3730 for Sanger or
Illumina MiSeq for NGS) and run sequencing according to
instrument protocols.
5.4. Data Analysis
5.4.1 Raw Data Processing:
• Use appropriate software to analyze and interpret sequencing
data (e.g., SeqPilot for Sanger data, and BaseSpace for NGS
data).
5.4.2 Mutation Analysis:
• Compare sequences against the reference CDKN1C gene
sequence using established bioinformatics tools.
• Identify SNPs, insertions, deletions, and other variants.
5.4.3 Interpretation:
• Interpret variants based on established guidelines (e.g., ACMG
guidelines).
• Classify variants as pathogenic, likely pathogenic, variant of
unknown significance (VUS), likely benign, or benign.
6. QUALITY CONTROL:
• Include positive and negative control samples in each batch of
PCR and sequencing.
• Perform repeat testing when necessary to confirm results.
• Ensure regular maintenance and calibration of equipment.
• Document all steps in appropriate logbooks.
7. REPORTING RESULTS:
• Results will be reviewed and verified by a senior technologist.
• Generate a comprehensive report including any identified
variants, their classification, and potential clinical significance.
• Report all results through the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
• Ensure timely communication of critical or significant findings to
the requesting clinician.
8. REFERENCES:
• Manufacturer manuals for all equipment used.
• ACMG guidelines for variant interpretation.
• Relevant peer-reviewed articles on CDKN1C gene function and
mutations.
9. REVISION LOG:
• This SOP will be reviewed and updated annually or as needed.
This protocol ensures thorough and accurate analysis of the
CDKN1C gene, adhering to all quality and regulatory standards in the
laboratory setting.
