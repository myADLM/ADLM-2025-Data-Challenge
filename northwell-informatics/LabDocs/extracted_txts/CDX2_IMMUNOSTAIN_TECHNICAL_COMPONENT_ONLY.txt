Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for CDX2
Immunostain, Technical Component Only
1. PURPOSE:
To provide a standardized protocol for the technical component of
generating results for CDX2 Immunostain, ensuring consistency,
accuracy, and the highest quality of histological evaluation in the
laboratory.
2. SCOPE:
This procedure applies to the histotechnicians and pathologists
responsible for processing, staining, and reviewing tissue specimens
using the CDX2 immunostain within the laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITIES:
• Histotechnicians: Responsible for processing tissue specimens,
preparing and performing the CDX2 immunostaining procedure,
and maintaining appropriate documentation.
• Pathologists: Responsible for the interpretation and reporting of
the CDX2 immunostain results.
• Laboratory Supervisor: Ensures that all staff follow the SOP and
that the necessary quality control measures are in place.
4. SPECIMEN ACCEPTANCE AND HANDLING:
• Ensure that the received tissue specimen is appropriately labeled
with patient identification and accompanied by a requisition form.
• Verify that specimens are fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin
and are adequately processed as per standard histology
protocols.
• Any discrepancies or issues with the specimen should be
reported immediately to the supervisor.
5. REAGENTS & SUPPLIES:
• CDX2 primary antibody (optimized dilution as per manufacturer’s
instructions).
• Secondary antibody conjugated with a suitable detection enzyme
such as horseradish peroxidase (HRP).
• Detection substrate (e.g., DAB for HRP).
• Positive control tissue known to express CDX2.
• Negative control tissue and/or antibody diluent/buffer.
• Cover slips, glass slides, Xylene, Ethanol, Hematoxylin (for
counterstaining).
• Automated or manual immunostaining equipment.
• Antigen retrieval solution and equipment (e.g., pressure cooker,
microwave, or water bath).
6. EQUIPMENT:
• Microtome
• Automated or manual staining platform
• Heat source (e.g., oven, microwave)
• Microscope for quality control
7. PROCEDURE:
A. Preparation of Sections:
1. Cut paraffin-embedded tissue blocks at 3-4 microns using the
microtome.
2. Float sections on warm water bath and mount on positively
charged glass slides. Label slides clearly with patient details.
B. Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
1. Deparaffinize tissue sections by immersing in xylene (2
changes, 5 minutes each).
2. Rehydrate through graded ethanol series (100%, 95%, 70%,
50%) to distilled water (2-3 minutes each step).
C. Antigen Retrieval:
1. Perform antigen retrieval according to the antibody
manufacturer’s instructions. Common methods include heating
in citrate buffer (pH 6) or EDTA buffer (pH 8) using either a
microwave, pressure cooker, or water bath for specified time
and temperature.
D. Immunostaining:
1. Block endogenous peroxidases by incubating sections in 3%
hydrogen peroxide in methanol for 10 minutes, followed by a
rinse in distilled water.
2. Block nonspecific binding with an appropriate blocking serum or
reagent as recommended by the antibody manufacturer.
3. Apply CDX2 primary antibody at the optimized dilution and
incubate appropriately (typically 30-60 minutes at room
temperature or overnight at 4°C).
4. Wash slides in PBS or TBS buffer.
5. Apply the secondary antibody (e.g., HRP-conjugated) and
incubate as per manufacturer’s instructions.
6. Wash slides in PBS or TBS buffer.
7. Develop color by applying the detection substrate (e.g., DAB)
and incubate until desired staining intensity is reached (usually
a few minutes), followed by thorough rinsing in water.
E. Counterstaining and Mounting:
1. Counterstain with hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes, followed by
bluing in running tap water.
2. Dehydrate through graded ethanols, clear in xylene, and mount
with a coverslip using a permanent mounting medium.
F. Quality Control:
1. Include a positive control known to express CDX2 in each batch
of staining to ensure staining efficacy.
2. Include a negative control (omitting the primary antibody) to
verify nonspecific binding of the secondary antibody.
3. Document staining results in the appropriate logbook.
8. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS:
• The pathologist will review stained slides under a microscope,
comparing patient tissue results against the positive and negative
controls.
• CDX2 positivity is indicated by nuclear staining in tissue sections.
9. TROUBLESHOOTING:
• Non-specific staining may be reduced by optimizing antibody
dilutions or incubation times.
• Weak staining may be improved by antigen retrieval optimization
or increasing the primary antibody concentration or incubation
time.
• Excessive background staining may require reducing antibody
concentrations or blocking steps enhancement.
10. DOCUMENTATION:
• Record all observations, including the date, time, patient
information, controls used, and all reagents and batch numbers
employed, in the immunostain logbook.
• Maintain proper records to ensure traceability and accountability.
11. REFERENCES:
• Manufacturer’s instructions for CDX2 antibody and detection kits.
• Laboratory-specific histology and immunohistochemistry manuals.
12. REVIEW:
• This SOP will be reviewed annually or whenever there are
significant changes in methodology, reagents, or equipment.
