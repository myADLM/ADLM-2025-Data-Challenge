Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Carcinoembryonic
Antigen (CEA) in Body Fluids
1. PURPOSE:
To establish a standardized procedure for the determination of
Carcinoembryonic Antigen (CEA) levels in body fluid samples using
the approved laboratory analyzer. This procedure ensures accurate,
reliable, and timely results that assist clinicians in the diagnosis and
monitoring of specific medical conditions.
2. SCOPE:
This SOP applies to all clinical laboratory personnel performing the
CEA test on body fluid samples in the clinical laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY:
• It is the responsibility of the trained laboratory technologists to
perform the CEA testing as outlined in this SOP.
• The supervisor is responsible for ensuring that all personnel
performing this procedure are properly trained and competent.
• All staff must adhere to quality control guidelines and take
appropriate corrective actions when necessary.
4. DEFINITIONS:
CEA: Carcinoembryonic Antigen, a protein that may be present at
higher levels in certain types of cancers and other conditions.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES:
• Approved laboratory analyzer capable of performing CEA tests
• CEA reagent kit
• Quality control materials (both high and low-level controls)
• Calibrators
• Specimen collection and transport materials (e.g., tubes, transport
containers)
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
6. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS:
Acceptable Specimens:
• Body fluids may include pleural fluid, peritoneal fluid,
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), or amniotic fluid.
• Specimens must be collected using aseptic techniques and
placed in appropriate containers.
• Samples should be delivered to the laboratory as soon as
possible after collection.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens that are hemolyzed, lipemic, or contain large
particulate matter should not be used.
• Specimens that are not properly labeled or have inadequate
volume.
7. PROCEDURE:
Preparation:
1. Wear appropriate PPE, including gloves and lab coat.
2. Verify that all reagents, calibrators, and quality control materials
are within the expiration dates.
3. Ensure that the analyzer is properly calibrated and maintained.
Quality Control:
1. Perform quality control tests according to the laboratory’s QC
protocol, using both high and low-level control materials.
2. Record all QC results. Acceptable ranges must be met before
proceeding with patient sample testing.
3. If QC results fall outside of the acceptable range, troubleshoot
the issue, document corrective actions, and repeat QC testing.
Sample Testing:
1. Verify and document the identification of the body fluid
specimen.
2. Mix the body fluid sample gently, avoiding vigorous agitation
that can cause hemolysis.
3. Aliquot the required volume of sample into the analyzer-specific
sample cup or tube.
4. Load the sample into the analyzer.
5. Enter patient information, including specimen type (e.g., pleural
fluid, CSF, etc.).
6. Initiate the test according to the manufacturer's instructions for
the analyzer.
Result Generation and Interpretation:
1. Review the raw data generated by the analyzer. Ensure all
quality control and calibration parameters are within acceptable
limits.
2. Verify the CEA concentration result aligns with the clinical
context and the specific body fluid type.
3. Document the results in the laboratory information system
(LIS).
8. REPORTING RESULTS:
1. Verify accuracy of result entries before reporting.
2. Follow site-specific guidelines for reporting results. Ensure
critical or significantly abnormal results are communicated to
the requesting physician promptly.
3. Note any relevant comments related to sample conditions or
potential interferences.
9. REFERENCE INTERVALS:
• As reference intervals for CEA may vary depending on body fluid
type and method of analysis, provide specific reference ranges
based on established laboratory standards or analyzer’s package
insert instructions.
10. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
1. Refer to the manufacturer's instructions for specific limitations
associated with the analyzer and reagents used.
2. Hemolysis, lipemia, or icterus may interfere with the accuracy of
the results. Such results must be reported with a note indicating
potential interference.
