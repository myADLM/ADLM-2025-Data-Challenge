1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the analytical phase of
generating results for CEDAR, IgE, and Serum. This protocol ensures
consistent and accurate processing, analysis, and reporting of these
tests in the clinical laboratory.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
• Designated laboratory technologists or scientists are responsible
for conducting the tests, ensuring the accuracy of results, and
proper documentation.
• The laboratory supervisor is responsible for monitoring the
process, troubleshooting any issues, and confirming the final
results.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND HANDLING
Specimens:
• Preferred/acceptable: Serum separated from a properly collected,
non-hemolyzed blood sample.
• Unacceptable: Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples. Samples
not stored or transported within the appropriate conditions.
Specimen stability:
• Serum samples are stable for up to 7 days if refrigerated (2-8°C)
or for longer periods if frozen at -20°C or below.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Automated immunoassay analyzer (e.g., IMMULITE, Cobas, or
any equivalent analyzer)
• CEDAR, IgE, and Serum-specific assay kits and reagents
• Calibrators, control materials, and standards as provided by the
assay kit manufacturer
• Specimen tubes (e.g., SST or equivalent) for serum collection
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes and disposable tips
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
1. PROCEDURE
2. Preparation:
◦ Ensure all reagents, controls, and calibrators are at room
temperature and properly mixed before use.
◦ Perform a preliminary inspection of specimens to confirm
acceptability.
3. Sample Preparation:
◦ Centrifuge clotted blood samples at 1500–2000 x g for 10
minutes to separate serum.
◦ Transfer the serum into labeled sample tubes using a
pipette, avoiding transfer of any cells or debris.
4. Assay Setup:
◦ Turn on the automated immunoassay analyzer and perform
the startup procedures as outlined by the manufacturer.
◦ Load the assay-specific reagents, calibrators, and controls
into the appropriate slots of the analyzer.
◦ Load patient serum samples into the sample carousel,
ensuring proper identification and position in the analyzer.
5. Calibration and Quality Control:
◦ Run calibration curves using the provided calibrators to
ensure the instrument is accurately measuring the analytes.
◦ Perform quality control tests using both low and high control
materials to validate that the system is functioning within
specified parameters.
◦ Document the results of the calibration and quality control
tests.
6. Analytical Run:
◦ Select the appropriate assay protocols for CEDAR, IgE, and
Serum on the analyzer’s software interface.
◦ Initiate the run and allow the analyzer to process the
samples, adhering to the assay-specific incubation periods
and measurement protocols.
◦ Monitor the analyzer for any error messages or alerts during
the analytical run.
7. Result Verification:
◦ Once the run is complete, review the results generated by
the analyzer.
◦ Ensure that all QC materials fall within acceptable ranges
before validating patient results.
◦ Investigate and document any QC failures or atypical assay
performances.
8. REPORTING RESULTS:
• Results are automatically transmitted to the Laboratory
Information System (LIS) and must be reviewed by the
technologist.
• Any critical results or those outside the expected ranges must be
verified and appropriately flagged in the LIS.
• Results must be reported in accordance with site-specific
reporting guidelines.
1. QUALITY CONTROL AND MAINTENANCE:
• Perform daily, weekly, and monthly maintenance as
recommended by the equipment manufacturer.
• Document all maintenance activities in the equipment logbook.
• Regularly review QC data to ensure ongoing accuracy and
precision of assays.
• Validate new lots of reagents, controls, and calibrators in
accordance with lab protocols.
1. REFERENCES:
• Manufacturer’s instructions and package inserts for CEDAR, IgE,
and Serum assay kits.
• Laboratory quality control and calibration guidelines.
• Relevant laboratory regulatory standards and procedures.
By following this protocol, the laboratory ensures reliable and
reproducible results for CEDAR, IgE, and Serum assays, maintaining
high standards of quality and accuracy in patient testing.
