Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Analysis of CEDAR RED
(JUNIPERUS VIRGINIANA) IgE
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized process for the analysis and quantification
of Cedar Red (Juniperus virginiana) IgE levels in patient samples,
ensuring accurate and reliable test results.
2. RESPONSIBILITIES
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the
analysis, documenting the results, and ensuring that any deviations
from expected outcomes are reported to the supervisor.
3. DEFINITIONS
CEDAR RED (JUNIPERUS VIRGINIANA) IgE: Specific
immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies directed against allergens from
the Eastern Red Cedar tree (Juniperus virginiana).
4. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Immunoassay analyzer (e.g., ELISA reader, Chemiluminescence
analyzer)
• CEDAR RED (JUNIPERUS VIRGINIANA) IgE assay kits
• Calibrators and controls specific to CEDAR RED (JUNIPERUS
VIRGINIANA) IgE
• Sample collection tubes (e.g., SST or serum separator tubes)
• Micro-pipettes and tips
• Centrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Lab coat, gloves, and other PPE
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred: Serum specimens
- Collection: Collect approximately 5-10 mL of blood in an SST tube.
- Label: Ensure that the sample tube is correctly labeled with patient identification and collection date/time.
- Processing: Allow the blood to clot, centrifuge at 1500 RPM for 10 minutes, and separate the serum. Store serum at 2-8°C if not immediately analyzed.
Unacceptable:
- Plasma specimens with anticoagulants like EDTA, heparin.
- Samples received without proper labeling and documentation.
- Samples that are not appropriately stored or have visible hemolysis.
6. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation
1. Wear appropriate PPE before beginning the procedure.
2. Ensure that all equipment, reagents, and samples are at
optimal operating conditions (e.g., room temperature).
3. Calibrate the immunoassay analyzer according to manufacturer
specifications.
B. Analysis
1. Sample Preparation:
◦ Pipette a known volume (as specified by the assay kit
instructions) of patient serum into the assay wells.
◦ Add the reagent as instructed in the assay kit protocol (e.g.,
Cedar Red (Juniperus virginiana) IgE-specific conjugated
enzyme, substrate, etc.).
2. Incubation:
◦ Incubate the samples as mentioned in the assay kit
protocol, ensuring optimal temperature and timing are
maintained.
3. Measurement:
◦ After the incubation, measure the reaction using the
immunoassay analyzer.
4. Quality Control:
◦ Run positive and negative controls alongside patient
samples to ensure the accuracy and reliability of results.
◦ Document the results of the controls. If any deviations occur,
troubleshoot according to kit guidelines and repeat the
analysis.
5. Result Generation:
◦ Analyze the data obtained from the analyzer and calculate
the IgE concentration using the provided standard curve.
◦ Record results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
C. Reporting
1. Review and verify all results by designated personnel.
2. Ensure compliance with reporting guidelines.
3. Document if there are any results outside the expected range
and notify the supervisor.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
Run quality control checks daily using control sera to monitor assay
performance. Refer to kit instructions for acceptable ranges.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the Cedar Red (Juniperus virginiana) IgE assay kit insert for
specific limitations regarding reagent interference, specific analyte
detection limits, and potential cross-reactivity.
9. REFERENCES
Refer to the Cedar Red (Juniperus virginiana) IgE assay kit
instructions for detailed procedural guidelines and limitations.
10. SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS
Adhere to laboratory safety protocols, including wearing PPE and
proper waste disposal measures. Handle all specimens and reagents
as per biosafety guidelines.
