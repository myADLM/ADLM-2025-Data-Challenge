CEFTRIAXONE REFERRAL LABORATORY
SOP for Analytical Phase: Generating Results
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to provide detailed and standardized
procedures for the analytical phase of testing Ceftriaxone
susceptibility in the referral laboratory. This ensures the accuracy,
reliability, and consistency of results for clinical decision-making.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel involved in the testing
and reporting of Ceftriaxone susceptibility results.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
Laboratory personnel tasked with performing and reviewing the
Ceftriaxone susceptibility tests must follow this SOP. It is the
responsibility of supervisors to ensure compliance and to address
any deviations from the protocol.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND
SUPPLIES
• Automated susceptibility testing instrument (e.g., VITEK,
MicroScan)
• Manual susceptibility testing supplies (e.g., disks, inoculation
tools, agar plates)
• Ceftriaxone sensitivity disks (as per CLSI standards)
• Mueller-Hinton agar plates
• Sterile saline for inoculum preparation
• Incubator (35°C ± 2°C)
• Calibrated pipettes and tips
• Sterile loops
• Quality control strains (e.g., E. coli ATCC 25922)
• Control and reference standards
• Appropriate PPE (gloves, lab coat, safety glasses)
5. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation
1. Prepare Inoculum:
◦ Use a sterile loop to transfer colonies from an overnight
culture to sterile saline to create a bacterial suspension.
◦ Adjust the turbidity of the suspension to match the 0.5
McFarland standard (1.5 x 10^8 CFU/mL).
2. Quality Control:
◦ Quality control strains must be tested alongside clinical
isolates each day the test is performed.
◦ Use specified quality control strains such as E. coli ATCC
25922 to ensure reliability of results.
B) Automated Susceptibility Testing
1. Instrument Preparation:
◦ Verify calibration status and instrument settings according to
the manufacturer's instructions.
◦ Load the Ceftriaxone susceptibility panel or card into the
instrument.
2. Loading Samples:
◦ Inoculate the panel or card with the bacterial suspension.
◦ Load the panels into the instrument as per the
manufacturer’s guidelines.
3. Running the Test:
◦ Start the test run and monitor instrument performance.
◦ Perform any necessary instrument maintenance as
indicated.
4. Result Interpretation:
◦ Once the test cycle is complete, retrieve and review results.
◦ Interpret the results using CLSI guidelines and recheck
instrument flags or alerts for any deviations.
C) Manual Susceptibility Testing (if required)
1. Inoculating Plates:
◦ Using a sterile swab, dip it into the bacterial suspension and
streak over the surface of a Mueller-Hinton agar plate to
form a lawn of growth.
◦ Place Ceftriaxone sensitivity disks onto the agar surface
immediately after inoculation.
2. Incubation:
◦ Incubate plates at 35°C ± 2°C for 16-18 hours. Ensure
plates are incubated face-up.
3. Reading Results:
◦ After incubation, measure the zone of inhibition around each
Ceftriaxone disk.
◦ Compare zones to CLSI standard for Ceftriaxone
susceptibility and interpret results accordingly.
6. QUALITY CONTROL AND
TROUBLESHOOTING
1. Repeat Tests:
◦ If quality control fails, identify and correct the source of error
before retesting samples.
◦ Document and resolve any deviations or unexpected
results.
2. Documentation:
◦ Record all QC activities, including the test date, results of
QC strains, corrective actions taken, and initials of the
technologist.
3. Troubleshooting:
◦ Address any flagged results or instrument alerts by
repeating the test or verifying with an alternative method.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Review and Validation:
◦ Review all test results for accuracy. Check for any
anomalies or flags.
◦ Validate results before entry into the LIS.
2. Entering Results into LIS:
◦ Accurately enter validated results into the Laboratory
Information System (LIS) for clinician access.
◦ Ensure critical results are flagged and communicated per
laboratory protocol.
3. Documentation and Record-Keeping:
◦ Maintain detailed records of all procedures, results, and QC
checks.
◦ Ensure proper storage of records for future reference and
compliance.
