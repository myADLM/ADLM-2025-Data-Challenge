Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for CELERY, IGE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE To ensure accurate, reliable, and timely results in
the analysis of CELERY, IGE, and SERUM samples. This
protocol outlines the procedures for handling, processing, and
reporting results for these specific tests.
Responsibility: It is the responsibility of designated laboratory staff to
follow this SOP in performing the analysis and reporting of CELERY,
IGE, and SERUM results. All staff are responsible for identifying any
deficiencies in the process that may affect test results and bringing
them to the attention of a supervisor.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen Types: - Blood serum collected in a red-top or SST tube.
Specimen Volume: - Minimum volume required: 1 mL of serum.
Specimen Stability: - Serum samples are stable for up to 48 hours at
2-8°C. - For long-term storage, samples may be frozen at -20°C for
up to 6 months.
Unacceptable Specimens: - Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric
specimens. - Specimens received in tubes other than specified
above. - Specimens contaminated with substances that may interfere
with the assay.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
Reagents: - CELERY, IGE assay kits (Manufacturer's instructions
must be adhered to). - Quality control materials for CELERY, IGE.
Supplies: - Pipettes and tips - Microtubes - Centrifuge - Refrigerator
and freezer
1. PROCEDURE
Sample Preparation: - Centrifuge blood collection tubes at 3000 rpm
for 10 minutes to separate serum. - Transfer the serum into a clean,
appropriately labeled microtube. Ensure that the label includes
patient's ID, date of collection, and type of test ordered. - Store serum
samples at 2-8°C until ready for analysis. If analysis is not performed
within 48 hours, freeze samples at -20°C.
Assay Procedure: - Follow the manufacturer's instructions provided in
the CELERY, IGE assay kit inserts. - Ensure all reagents, controls,
and specimens are at room temperature before starting the assay. -
Pipette the required volume of serum into the designated wells in the
assay plate. - Add appropriate reagents as per the kit instructions. -
Incubate for the specified times at the recommended temperatures. -
Measure absorbance or fluorescence using a microplate reader.
Quality Control: - Run control samples (Negative and Positive
controls) alongside patient specimens each time the assay is
performed. - Verify control results are within the acceptable range
before validating patient results. - Document control results, any
deviations from the expected range, and corrective actions taken.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
Results Interpretation: - Reference intervals for CELERY and IGE
should follow the guidelines provided by the manufacturer. - Interpret
patient results in the context of quality control data.
Documentation: - Record results in the Laboratory Information
System (LIS). - Verify all data entries for accuracy before finalizing
reports. - Ensure critical values are flagged, and follow protocol for
immediate reporting to the physician.

1. QUALITY CONTROL AND VALIDATION
Ensure all assays are validated periodically according to the
laboratory’s quality control program. Document any troubleshooting
and corrective actions in the designated logbook.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the assay kit inserts for method limitations and expected
performance characteristics.
By adhering to this protocol, laboratory staff will help to ensure the
accuracy and reliability of results for CELERY, IGE, and SERUM
analysis. It is essential that all steps be followed meticulously, and
any variances or issues be promptly addressed and documented.
