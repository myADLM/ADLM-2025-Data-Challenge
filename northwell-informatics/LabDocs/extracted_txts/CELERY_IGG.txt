Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase of Generating Results for Celery IgG
1. PURPOSE
To provide standardized instructions for the analytical phase of
testing Celery IgG levels in patient serum samples. This ensures the
accuracy, reliability, and consistency of test results.
RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all trained and designated laboratory
personnel to follow the procedures outlined in this SOP for the
analysis of Celery IgG.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to the analysis of Celery IgG in serum samples
using approved analytical methods and equipment.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Analyzer for Immunoassay (e.g., ELISA reader, Automated
Immunoassay System)
• Celery IgG-specific test kits and reagents (as per manufacturer’s
instructions)
• Calibrators
• Controls (positive and negative)
• Micropipettes and tips
• Plate washers (for ELISA methods)
• Incubator (if required)
• Timer
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
4. SAMPLE REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred Specimen: 2-5 mL serum, collected in a red-top or
serum-separator tube (SST)
• Stability: Serum samples can be stored at 2-8°C for up to 3 days.
For longer storage, samples should be frozen at -20°C or below.
• Unacceptable Specimens: Samples with gross hemolysis,
lipemia, or icterus.
5. PROCEDURE
5.1. Calibration and Quality Control
1. Perform calibration and quality control checks as per the
manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Run calibrators and controls. Ensure that control results are
within the established acceptable ranges before proceeding
with patient samples.
3. Document all calibrations and quality control results in the
appropriate log.
5.2. Sample Preparation
1. Allow frozen serum samples to thaw completely at room
temperature.
2. Mix samples gently by inversion; do not vortex to avoid frothing.
3. Centrifuge if particulate matter is present.
5.3. Analytical Testing
Using ELISA Method:
1. Prepare the ELISA plate as per the kit instructions.
2. Add the specified volume of calibrators, controls, and patient
samples to the designated wells in duplicate.
3. Add the indicated volume of enzyme-conjugated anti-human
IgG to all wells.
4. Incubate the plate at the specified temperature and time as per
the manufacturer's protocol.
5. Wash the plate using a plate washer, following the wash steps
detailed by the manufacturer.
6. Add the specified substrate solution to each well and incubate
for the time stated in the protocol.
7. Stop the reaction by adding the stopping solution as outlined in
the kit instructions.
8. Read the plate immediately using an ELISA reader at the
recommended wavelength (e.g., 450 nm).
Using Automated Immunoassay System:
1. Load calibrators, controls, and patient samples onto the
instrument as per the system’s protocol.
2. Follow the instrument’s software instructions to initiate the
Celery IgG assay.
3. The instrument will automatically manage reagent addition,
incubation, washing, and reading.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Calculate sample concentrations from the calibration curve for
ELISA methods or obtain results directly from the automated
system.
2. Cross-check results with control ranges: if controls do not fall
within the preset ranges, troubleshoot and repeat the samples.
3. Document the results in the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
7. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Celery IgG Reference Range: Results should be interpreted in the
context of the patient’s clinical history and other relevant data.
Note: Establishment of reference intervals may require additional
validation steps.
8. QUALITY ASSURANCE
1. Ensure all equipment is regularly maintained and calibrated.
2. Participate in external quality assurance programs for Celery
IgG testing.
3. Review and update this SOP annually or as necessary.
9. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If results are unexpected or quality control results are outside the
limits, refer to the troubleshooting guide provided by the kit/
instrument manufacturer.
• Document any issues and corrective actions in the maintenance
log.
