Standard Operating Procedure
for Celiac Associated HLA-DQ
Alpha 1 and DQ Beta 1 DNA
Typing, Blood
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to provide clear guidelines for the
analytical phase of generating results for Celiac Associated HLA-DQ
Alpha 1 and DQ Beta 1 DNA Typing from blood specimens. This
ensures the accuracy, reliability, and reproducibility of results.
Responsibility:
• It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory technologist to
perform and document all steps outlined in this procedure.
• It is also the responsibility of staff and supervisors to review and
verify results, handle any deviations, and ensure compliance with
this SOP.
1. DEFINITION
HLA-DQ Alpha 1 and DQ Beta 1 typing involves PCR amplification of
targeted regions followed by sequence-specific oligonucleotide probe
hybridization to detect genetic markers associated with celiac
disease.
1. SAFETY PRECAUTIONS
• Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) including
lab coats, gloves, and safety goggles.
• Handle all biological specimens as if they are potentially infectious
and dispose of waste according to biohazard regulations.
1. EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS
• PCR Thermocycler
• Dedicated pipettes and barrier tips
• Microcentrifuge
• Nuclease-free tubes and water
• DNA extraction kit (e.g., QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit)
• DNA quantification device (e.g., NanoDrop spectrophotometer)
• HLA-DQ Alpha 1 and DQ Beta 1 typing kit
• Reagent tubes (e.g., oligonucleotide probes, primers, dNTPs, Taq
polymerase)
• Thermal cycler
• Agarose gel electrophoresis apparatus (as needed)
• Documentation materials (logbooks, worksheets, etc.)
1. PROCEDURE
A) DNA Extraction
1. Sample Preparation:
◦ Verify the sample accession and label the sample vials and
tubes with patient identification.
◦ Collect 200 µL of the blood specimen into a labeled
microcentrifuge tube.
2. Lysis:
◦ Add appropriate lysis buffer to the blood sample as per the
DNA extraction kit instructions.
◦ Incubate and vortex as instructed to ensure complete lysis
of the cells.
3. DNA Binding, Washing, and Elution:
◦ Follow the protocol outlined in the DNA extraction kit to bind
DNA to the column, wash away contaminants, and elute
purified DNA.
4. Quantification:
◦ Quantify the extracted DNA using a NanoDrop
spectrophotometer.
◦ Record the DNA concentration and purity (A260/A280 ratio).
B) PCR Amplification
1. Preparation:
◦ Set up the PCR reaction in a sterilized environment to avoid
contamination.
◦ Prepare a master mix containing primers, dNTPs, Taq
polymerase, and nuclease-free water as per the HLA-DQ
typing kit instructions.
2. Reaction Setup:
◦ Pipette the master mix into labeled PCR tubes or plates.
◦ Add an appropriate volume of extracted DNA to each tube.
◦ Include positive and negative controls to the reaction.
3. Cycling Conditions:
◦ Load the tubes onto the PCR thermocycler.
◦ Program the thermocycler with cycling conditions specific for
HLA-DQ typing (e.g., initial denaturation at 95°C for 2
minutes followed by 35 cycles of denaturation at 95°C for 30
seconds, annealing at 55°C for 30 seconds, extension at
72°C for 30 seconds, and final extension at 72°C for 5
minutes).
C) Post-PCR Analysis
1. Agarose Gel Electrophoresis (if applicable):
◦ Prepare a 2% agarose gel with an appropriate DNA stain
(e.g., ethidium bromide or GelRed).
◦ Load PCR products and molecular weight markers into the
wells.
◦ Run the electrophoresis at 100V for 30-45 minutes.
◦ Visualize the results under UV light and document the gel
image.
D) Hybridization and Detection
1. Probe Hybridization:
◦ Use the kit’s probe hybridization technique to detect HLA-
DQ alleles.
◦ Follow manufacturer's instructions for hybridization,
washing, and detection procedures.
E) Result Interpretation and Documentation
1. Result Interpretation:
◦ Compare the patient’s results to known HLA-DQ alpha 1
and beta 1 allele patterns to determine genotype.
◦ Consult reference documentation for interpretation criteria.
2. Documentation and Verification:
◦ Record results in the laboratory information system (LIS).
◦ Have another qualified technologist or supervisor verify the
results for accuracy.
◦ Document any discrepancies and resolve before final report
generation.
3. Reporting:
◦ Prepare the final report detailing the HLA-DQ typing results.
◦ Review the report for errors or omissions; ensure all results
are correctly documented and signed by verifying personnel.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include both positive and negative quality controls with each
batch of samples processed.
• Perform routine proficiency testing as mandated by regulatory
standards.
• Maintain logs of all quality control measures and any corrective
actions taken when controls fall outside acceptable ranges.
