Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to define and implement standardized
procedures for the analytical phase of generating results for the
Celiac Disease Comprehensive Cascade, serum and whole blood,
ensuring accuracy and consistency in test performance and results.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
All testing laboratory personnel are responsible for adhering to this
SOP. The laboratory supervisor is responsible for the supervision and
verification of results.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Serum:
• Preferred/acceptable: 5 mL of fresh blood, collected in a serum
separator tube (SST). The blood should be allowed to clot for at
least 30 minutes and then centrifuged at 1,500 x g for 10 minutes
to separate the serum.
• Unacceptable: Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric specimens.
Whole Blood:
• Preferred/acceptable: 3 mL of fresh blood, collected in an EDTA
(lavender top) tube.
• Unacceptable: Clotted, hemolyzed, or improperly labeled
specimens.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Automated Immunoassay Analyzer
• Standard micropipettes and tips
• Centrifuge
• EDTA tubes (for whole blood)
• SST tubes (for serum)
• Calibrators and Controls for Celiac markers
• Deionized water
• Gloves, lab coats, and other PPE
1. PROCEDURE
A. Serum Preparation:
1. Centrifugation:
◦ Ensure the serum separator tube (SST) has properly
clotted.
◦ Centrifuge the SST at 1,500 x g for 10 minutes.
◦ Carefully transfer the clear serum into a clean, labeled
secondary tube.
2. Storing and Preparation for Analysis:
◦ Store the serum at 2-8°C if immediate testing is not
possible.
◦ If testing is delayed beyond 48 hours, freeze the serum at
-20°C or lower.
B. Whole Blood Preparation:
1. MIXING:
◦ Ensure the whole blood collected in EDTA tubes is
adequately mixed by gentle inversion (8-10 times).
2. STORING:
◦ Store the whole blood samples at 4°C if testing is not
immediate.
C. Analyzing Samples:
1. CALIBRATION AND QC:
◦ Perform calibration using the provided calibrators for anti-
TTG IgA, anti-EMA IgA, DGP, and total IgA.
◦ Process quality control samples every shift to ensure the
system's accuracy.
2. LOADING SAMPLES:
◦ Load prepared serum or whole blood samples onto the
automated immunoassay analyzer as per the
manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Ensure that the analyzer settings match the assay
requirements (e.g., incubation time, temperature, etc.)
3. RESULT GENERATION:
◦ Carefully review the auto-generated results for any flags or
error codes.
◦ Compare the sample results to QC data to confirm accuracy.
◦ Note and document any discrepancies or issues.
D. Documentation and Reporting:
1. DOCUMENTATION:
◦ Record the sample information, testing time, and results in
the laboratory's information system.
◦ Retain printed reports for all QC and patient samples for
audit and quality assurance purposes.
2. REPORTING:
◦ Verify and validate the test results.
◦ Transfer the results to the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
◦ Ensure that flagged and critical values comply with protocol
reporting requirements.
3. RESULT INTERPRETATION:
• Positive Result: Indicates the presence of one or more of the
following markers: anti-TTG IgA, anti-EMA IgA, DGP antibodies.
• Negative Result: Indicates the absence of the above markers or
values below the established reference range.
• Equivocal Result: May require a repeated test or additional
testing for confirmation.
1. QUALITY CONTROL AND VALIDATION
• Internal QC:
◦ Perform routine analysis of QC samples (positive and negative
controls) to verify the performance of the assay. Document
and review control data.
• Validation:
◦ Validate all new lots of reagents or calibrators before routine
use.
◦ Perform method validations as required by regulation and
accreditation standards.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING
• For any malfunctioning or significant deviations in test results,
follow up with repeated tests, review QC results, and inform the
supervisor immediately.
• Follow manufacturer’s troubleshoot guidelines as provided in the
equipment manual for specific error codes.
