Analytical Phase Protocol for Celiac Disease Gluten-
Free Cascade, Serum, and Whole Blood
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this protocol is to ensure the accurate and reliable
performance of the analytical phase in the testing of Celiac Disease
Gluten-Free Cascade using serum and whole blood specimens. This
protocol describes the steps for sample preparation, testing
procedures, quality control, and reporting of results for detecting
indicators of celiac disease.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
All laboratory personnel performing tests for Celiac Disease Gluten-
Free Cascade are responsible for adhering to this protocol to ensure
consistency and reliability of results. Supervisors are responsible for
overseeing the procedure and ensuring compliance.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/Acceptable Specimens:
• Serum: Collect blood in a serum separator tube (SST) and allow it
to clot for 30 minutes. Centrifuge for 10 minutes at 1,200 - 1,500 x
g to separate serum. The specimen should be tested immediately
or stored at 2-8°C for up to 72 hours.
• Whole Blood: Collect blood in an EDTA or heparinized vacutainer.
The sample should be tested within 24 hours when stored at
2-8°C.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
• Samples that are improperly labeled or collected in incorrect
containers.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) kit for Anti-tTG
(Tissue Transglutaminase) IgA and IgG.
• Centrifuge.
• Micropipettes and tips.
• Reagent reservoirs.
• Vortex mixer.
• Diagnostic reagents as provided by the ELISA kit manufacturer
(diluent, wash buffer, substrate solution, stop solution).
• Laboratory timer.
• ELISA Plate Reader.
5. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Equilibrate all reagents and specimens to room temperature
(20-25°C) before use.
2. Prepare reagents as directed by the ELISA kit instructions.
3. Label all necessary tubes, ELISA plate wells, and other
containers appropriately.
Assay Procedure:
1. Perform a 1:101 dilution of each serum sample using the
provided dilution buffer.
2. For whole blood samples, separate plasma by centrifuging at
1,200 - 1,500 x g for 10 minutes.
3. Add 100 μL of calibrators, controls, and diluted patient samples
into the designated wells of the microtiter plate.
4. Incubate the plate for 30 minutes at room temperature.
5. Wash the plate 5 times with the provided wash buffer to remove
unbound substances.
6. Add 100 μL of Enzyme Conjugate to each well. Incubate for 30
minutes at room temperature.
7. Wash the plate 5 times again with the wash buffer.
8. Add 100 μL of Substrate Solution to each well. Incubate for 15
minutes in the dark.
9. Add 50 μL of Stop Solution to each well to halt the reaction.
10. Measure the absorbance of each well at the specified
wavelength (usually 450 nm) using the ELISA plate reader.
Quality Control:
1. Run positive and negative controls with each batch of samples
to validate the assay.
2. Ensure calibrators meet the criteria for assay acceptance as
defined in the ELISA kit instructions.
3. Document the results of controls and take necessary corrective
actions if controls fail.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Calculate patient results based on the standards curve
generated using the calibrators.
2. Record the results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
3. Verify and validate the results by the laboratory technologist.
4. Report results in accordance with laboratory reporting
guidelines.
7. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS:
• Negative: No significant binding observed; the patient is unlikely
to have celiac disease.
• Positive: Significant binding observed; further clinical correlation is
required to confirm the diagnosis of celiac disease. Referral to a
gastroenterologist may be necessary for further assessment.

By following this protocol, the laboratory ensures precise and reliable
detection of antibodies related to Celiac Disease in serum and whole
blood samples, supporting accurate diagnosis and management of
the disease.
