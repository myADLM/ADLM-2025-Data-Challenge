Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
CELIAC DISEASE SEROLOGY CASCADE, SERUM
1. Purpose
To provide accurate and efficient analysis of serum samples for the
detection of celiac disease serological markers following the cascade
protocol.
2. Specimen Requirements
Specimen Type: Serum
Preferred/acceptable:
• 5-10 mL of blood collected in a serum separator tube (SST) or
plain red-top tube.
• Samples should be centrifuged to separate serum within 2 hours
of collection.
Unacceptable:
• Hemolyzed samples
• Insufficient volume (<2 mL of serum)
• Samples received more than 48 hours after collection without
proper storage (stored at 2-8°C for short term, -20°C for long
term)
3. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies
• Centrifuge
• Serum separator tubes (SST) or plain red-top tubes
• Elisa Kits (for tTG-IgA, tTG-IgG, EMA-IgA, DGP-IgG, and total
IgA)
• Automated ELISA Reader
• Microplate Washer
• Timer
• Pipette and tips
• Refrigerator (2-8°C) and freezer (-20°C)
• Reaction buffer as specified in ELISA kit insert
4. Procedure
A) Pre-Analytical Preparation:
1. Check specimen identification and integrity. Ensure proper
labelling and correspondence with requisition.
2. Allow samples to clot, then centrifuge samples at 1500-2000 x
g for 10 minutes to separate serum.
3. Transfer serum into a labelled microtube and store at 2-8°C
until ready for analysis. For long-term storage, freeze at -20°C.
B) Analytical Procedure:
1. Assay Setup and Preparation:
◦ Ensure all reagents, calibrators, and controls are at room
temperature (18-25°C).
◦ Refer to ELISA kit insert for specific instructions regarding
dilution and reagent preparation.
2. Testing for Tissue Transglutaminase IgA (tTG-IgA):
◦ Prepare microplate wells as per ELISA kit instructions.
◦ Add 100 µL of each serum sample, calibrator, and control to
designated wells.
◦ Incubate at room temperature for the specified time
(typically 30-60 minutes).
◦ Wash wells with wash buffer using microplate washer.
◦ Add 100 µL of enzyme conjugate to each well.
◦ Incubate at room temperature for the specified time.
◦ Wash wells thoroughly again.
◦ Add substrate solution to each well, incubate in the dark as
specified.
◦ Add stop solution to terminate the reaction.
◦ Read the plate using an automated ELISA reader at the
required wavelength (typically 450 nm).
3. Testing for Tissue Transglutaminase IgG (tTG-IgG):
◦ Follow the same steps as tTG-IgA using the specific ELISA
kit for tTG-IgG.
4. Testing for Endomysial IgA (EMA-IgA):
◦ Follow similar steps using the specific ELISA kit for EMA-
IgA.
5. Testing for Deamidated Gliadin Peptide IgG (DGP-IgG):
◦ Follow similar steps using the specific ELISA kit for DGP-
IgG.
6. Testing for Total IgA:
◦ Follow similar steps using the specific ELISA kit for total IgA.
5. Quality Control:
1. Run positive and negative controls with each batch of tests to
ensure assay validity.
2. Follow manufacturer’s instructions for acceptable control
ranges and troubleshooting steps.
3. Document all QC results and actions taken for out-of-range
results.
6. Reporting Results:
1. Results are reviewed by a trained technologist.
2. Verify and validate results following comparison with calibrator
and control values.
3. Refer to site-specific reporting guidelines for the LIS entry and
result transmission to physician.
7. Reference Intervals:
Refer to specific ELISA kit insert for reference intervals for each
marker, e.g.:
• tTG-IgA: Negative <20 U/mL
• tTG-IgG: Negative <20 U/mL
• EMA-IgA: Negative
• DGP-IgG: Negative <20 U/mL
• Total IgA: Normal range as per kit instructions
8. Method Limitations:
Refer to ELISA kit insert for limitations related to each assay.
Possible limitations include:
• Cross-reactivity with similar autoantibodies
• Interference from other serum components (lipemia, hemolysis,
etc.)
