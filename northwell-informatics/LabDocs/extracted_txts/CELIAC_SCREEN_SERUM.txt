STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP)
CELIAC SCREEN, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
To provide standardized laboratory procedures for the analysis of
CELIAC SCREEN, SERUM to ensure accurate and reproducible
results.
RESPONSIBILITY:
It is the responsibility of all designated laboratory staff to perform the
analysis of Celiac Screen, Serum following this SOP. Supervisors are
responsible for ensuring adherence to this protocol and resolving any
issues that may arise during the analytical phase.
2. SPECIMEN
Preferred/Acceptable Specimen:
• 5 mL serum from a blood sample collected in a serum separator
tube (SST).
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric specimens.
Specimen Handling and Storage:
• Allow the blood to clot for 30 minutes at room temperature.
• Centrifuge the SST at 2500-3000 RPM for 15-20 minutes to
separate the serum.
• Store serum at 2-8°C if testing will be completed within 72 hours.
For longer storage, freeze serum aliquots at -20°C or lower.
3. PROCEDURE
Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies:
• Automated Immunoassay Analyzer (e.g., ELISA or
Chemiluminescent Immunoassay)
• Celiac Disease Screening Kit (tTG-IgA, EMA-IgA, and optionally
DGP-IgG)
• Calibrators and Controls for Celiac Disease Screening
• Disposable tips and microplate strips
• Pipettes (Variable volume, calibrated)
• Microplate reader (if using ELISA method)
• Data management system for result entry and processing
Preparation:
1. Perform and document daily instrument maintenance and
calibration as per manufacturer guidelines.
2. Review quality control (QC) data to ensure the stability and
accuracy of the analyzer. Run QC samples at the beginning of
the shift and when changing reagent lots.
Testing Procedure:
1. Sample Preparation:
◦ Thaw frozen serum samples at room temperature and mix
gently before proceeding.
◦ Label all samples, controls, and calibrators clearly.
2. Running the Assay:
◦ Load samples, controls, and calibrators onto the designated
positions on the analyzer following the manufacturer's
instructions.
◦ Ensure that the analyzer settings (e.g., incubation time,
wash cycles, detection method) are in accordance with the
specific assay being used.
3. Incubation:
◦ Incubate the samples with reagents on the analyzer as per
the assay requirements.
◦ Ensure that incubation temperatures are consistently
maintained as per the kit instructions.
4. Detection:
◦ Perform the detection step (e.g., read the absorbance on a
microplate reader or measure luminescence on a
chemiluminescent analyzer) as specified by the assay
protocol.
◦ Ensure that the detection system settings match with the
assay kit specifications.
4. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Result Interpretation:
◦ The analysis software will automatically calculate the
concentrations of anti-tTG IgA, EMA IgA, and DGP IgG (if
applicable) based on the standard curve.
◦ Compare patient results to the reference ranges provided by
the manufacturer.
2. Critical Values and Flags:
◦ Follow site-specific guidelines for flagging and handling
critical values or outliers.
◦ Immediate supervisor notification is required for critical or
significantly abnormal results.
3. Documentation:
◦ Verify results against QC data and raw data printouts.
◦ Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
◦ Ensure all results are reviewed and verified by a certified
technologist.
Reference Intervals:
• Anti-tTG IgA: Negative (<10 U/mL), Borderline (10-15 U/mL),
Positive (≥16 U/mL)
• EMA IgA: Negative (≤1:10 dilution), Positive (≥1:10 dilution)
• DGP IgG (if applicable): Negative (<20 U/mL), Positive (≥20 U/
mL)
5. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Internal Quality Control:
◦ Run and document internal controls with every batch of
patient samples.
◦ Include negative and positive controls for each analyte
tested (anti-tTG IgA, EMA IgA, DGP IgG).
2. External Quality Assessment:
◦ Participate in external proficiency testing programs at least
twice per year.
◦ Analyze and document external control results and take
corrective action as needed.
3. Troubleshooting:
◦ If QC results fall outside acceptable ranges, do not report
patient results. Repeat the QC tests and take corrective
measures.
◦ Investigate and resolve any discrepancies before resuming
testing.
6. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• False-negative results may occur if the patient has selective IgA
deficiency. Consider testing for total IgA levels or using IgG-based
tests if IgA deficiency is suspected.
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric specimens may interfere with the
assay performance and are considered unacceptable.

immunoassays.
REVIEW AND REVISION:
This SOP will be reviewed annually or when changes are made to
methodologies or equipment, whichever comes first.
By following this SOP, laboratory personnel will ensure accurate and
reliable results in the analysis of CELIAC SCREEN, SERUM for
diagnosis and management of Celiac Disease.
