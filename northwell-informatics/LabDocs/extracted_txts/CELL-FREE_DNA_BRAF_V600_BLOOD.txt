Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Generating Results for
CELL-FREE DNA BRAF V600, BLOOD
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedures for analyzing
blood samples for cell-free DNA (cfDNA) BRAF V600 mutation
detection using PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) and subsequent
reporting of results.
Responsibility:
The designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing
the analysis and ensuring accurate and timely reporting of results. It
is the responsibility of the personnel to follow this protocol, ensure
quality control is maintained, and report any deviations to the
supervisor.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• PCR Instrument (e.g., COBAS Z480)
• Cell-free DNA isolation kit (e.g., QIAamp Circulating Nucleic Acid
Kit)
• BRAF V600 mutation detection kit (e.g., cobas BRAF V600
Mutation Test)
• Real-Time PCR reagents
• DNA quantification device (e.g., Qubit Fluorometer)
• Nuclease-free water
• Microcentrifuge tubes
• Pipettes and tips (sterile and filtered)
• Thermal cycler
1. PROCEDURE
A. Pre-Analysis Preparation:
1. Ensure all equipment is properly calibrated and functioning.
2. Verify that all reagents are within their expiration dates and
have been stored correctly.
3. Prepare necessary record forms/logs for documenting the
process.
B. Specimen Processing:
1. Isolation of cfDNA:
◦ Start with plasma collected in EDTA tubes. Ensure samples
are processed within 2 hours of collection or stored at
-80°C.
◦ Centrifuge the blood at 1600 x g for 10 minutes at 4°C to
separate plasma.
◦ Carefully transfer the plasma to a new tube, avoiding the
cellular components.
◦ Centrifuge the plasma again at 16,000 x g for 10 minutes at
4°C to remove any remaining cellular debris.
◦ Use the Qiagen QIAamp Circulating Nucleic Acid Kit to
isolate cfDNA from the plasma following the manufacturer’s
instructions.
◦ Elute the cfDNA in the appropriate elution buffer.
2. DNA Quantification:
◦ Measure the concentration of cfDNA using the Qubit
Fluorometer according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
Document results.
C. PCR Amplification:
1. Reaction Setup:
◦ Prepare the PCR mix using the cobas BRAF V600 Mutation
Test kit.
◦ Mix the following components in a PCR tube: cfDNA
template, PCR master mix, primers/probe mix, and
nuclease-free water.
2. Cycling Conditions:
◦ Perform PCR amplification with the following cycling
conditions:
▪ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 10 minutes
▪ Amplification: 45 cycles of 95°C for 15 seconds, 60°C for
1 minute
D. Post-Amplification Analysis:
1. Data Analysis:
◦ Analyze PCR results using the appropriate software (e.g.,
COBAS Z480 system software).
◦ Detect the presence or absence of the BRAF V600 mutation
and interpret the data according to kit instructions.
2. Quality Control:
◦ Include positive and negative controls in each run.
◦ Ensure that the controls fall within expected ranges to
validate the run.
◦ Document all observations and any deviations.
3. REPORTING RESULTS
4. Record the results in the laboratory information system (LIS).
5. Review and verify the results with a senior technologist or
supervisor.
6. Report the results following the laboratory’s guidelines and
protocols.
7. For positive results, ensure that additional confirmatory testing
is performed if required.
8. Communicate critical results immediately to the requesting
physician or healthcare provider as per the laboratory’s policy.
9. REFERENCE INTERVALS AND REPORT INTERPRETATION
• Negative: No BRAF V600 mutation detected.
• Positive: BRAF V600 mutation detected.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
2. Run quality control measures per laboratory protocol to ensure
the accuracy and reliability of results.
3. Maintain records of all quality control activities and any
corrective actions undertaken.
4. TROUBLESHOOTING
5. If no amplification is observed in both sample and controls,
repeat the PCR setup ensuring all reagents and equipment are
functioning correctly.
6. If the result is inconclusive, repeat the entire process from
cfDNA isolation using the remaining plasma sample.
