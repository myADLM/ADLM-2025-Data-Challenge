Standard Operating Procedure: Analytical
Phase for Cell-Free DNA EGFR T790M
Mutation Analysis, Blood
1. Purpose
The purpose of this procedure is to provide detailed instructions for
the analytical phase of generating results for cell-free DNA (cfDNA)
EGFR T790M mutation analysis from blood samples. This protocol
includes DNA extraction, quantitative analysis, PCR amplification,
mutation detection, and result interpretation. This testing is significant
for monitoring non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and directing
appropriate therapy.
2. Responsibility
It is the responsibility of laboratory technologists to follow these
procedures accurately. It is the responsibility of laboratory
supervisors to ensure compliance and proper training of personnel.
3. Specimen
Acceptable Specimen:
• Plasma separated from whole blood collected in EDTA tubes.
• Plasma should be separated and frozen at -20°C within 2 hours of
collection.
• A minimum volume of 6 mL of plasma is required.
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Blood samples not processed within the required time frame.
• Blood collected in tubes other than EDTA.
• Plasma samples with visible hemolysis.
4. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies
• Digital PCR (dPCR) or real-time PCR (qPCR) instrument
• DNA extraction kit specific for cfDNA (e.g., QIAamp Circulating
Nucleic Acid Kit)
• PCR master mix reagents
• EGFR T790M specific primers and probes
• Nuclease-free water
• 0.2 mL PCR tubes or 96-well plate
• Vortex mixer
• Microcentrifuge
• Refrigerator (2-8°C)
• Freezer (-20°C or -80°C)
5. Quality Control
• Run positive and negative controls with each assay batch.
• Use external quality control material as per manufacturer’s
instructions.
• Document all QC results and take corrective actions if controls
are out of range.
6. Procedure
A. DNA Extraction
1. Plasma Preparation: Thaw plasma samples on ice.
2. Cell-Free DNA Extraction:
◦ Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for the DNA
extraction kit.
◦ Elute the cfDNA in a final volume of 50 μL of nuclease-free
water.
◦ Quantify extracted DNA using a fluorometer and store
extracts at -20°C until analysis.
B. Quantitative Analysis
1. DNA Quantification: Measure the concentration of extracted
cfDNA using a fluorometric method or equivalent.
◦ Ensure the DNA concentration is within the assay's
acceptable range.
C. PCR Amplification
1. Reaction Setup:
◦ Prepare PCR master mix reagents according to the
manufacturer’s directions.
◦ Add primers and probes specific for the EGFR T790M
mutation.
◦ Aliquot 20 μL of prepared master mix into each reaction
tube/well.
◦ Add 5 μL of extracted cfDNA to each reaction tube/well.
◦ Include no-template controls (NTC) and positive controls in
each run.
2. Thermal Cycling Conditions:
◦ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 10 minutes.
◦ 45 cycles of:
▪ Denaturation: 95°C for 15 seconds
▪ Annealing/Extension: 60°C for 1 minute
D. Mutation Detection
1. Digital PCR or Real-Time PCR Analysis:
◦ Load the PCR plate into the PCR instrument.
◦ Collect data according to the instrument’s user manual.
◦ Identify and quantify the T790M mutant alleles.
E. Result Interpretation
1. Data Analysis:
◦ Analyze the Ct (threshold cycle) values for the presence or
absence of the EGFR T790M mutation.
◦ Compare with positive and negative controls to validate
results.
◦ Quantify the fractional abundance of mutant alleles.
F. Reporting Results
1. Review:
◦ Review all controls and ensure they are within the
acceptable range.
◦ Report results according to site-specific guidelines,
indicating either the presence or absence of the EGFR
T790M mutation and the mutant allele frequency.
◦ Ensure that results are reviewed and signed off by a
qualified technologist or supervisor before reporting.
7. Method Limitations
• Sensitivity and specificity depend on the quality of cfDNA and the
efficiency of PCR amplification.
• False negatives may occur if the mutant allele is below the
detection limit of the assay.
• Hemolysis and other sample quality issues may affect the
accuracy of results.
8. References
• Manufacturer's Instructions for the QIAamp Circulating Nucleic
Acid Kit
• Digital PCR or qPCR Instrument User Manual
• Relevant literature on EGFR T790M mutation analysis in plasma.
9. Documentation and Records
• Maintain detailed records of all sample processing, PCR run
details, QC results, and result reporting.
• Store records securely in compliance with laboratory and
regulatory requirements.
10. Revision History
• Document any updates or revisions to this SOP with the date and
description of changes.
This protocol ensures that the analytical phase of generating results
for cell-free DNA EGFR T790M mutation analysis is performed
consistently and accurately, adhering to the highest standards of
laboratory practice.
