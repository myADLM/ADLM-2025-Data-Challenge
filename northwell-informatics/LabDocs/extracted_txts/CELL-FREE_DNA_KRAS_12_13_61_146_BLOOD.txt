Standard Operating Procedure for CELL-FREE DNA KRAS 12,
13, 61, 146, BLOOD
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to provide standardized procedures for
the analytical phase of generating results for the CELL-FREE DNA
KRAS 12, 13, 61, and 146 in blood specimens. This includes
preparation, amplification and detection of mutations in the KRAS
gene, maintaining accuracy, consistency, and quality of the test
results.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENT
Preferred/Acceptable:
• 10 mL of whole blood collected in a Streck cell-free DNA BCT
tube.
• Blood samples should be processed within 2 hours of collection to
plasma to avoid the potential contamination of cell-free DNA with
genomic DNA from lysed cells.
Unacceptable:
• Blood collected in EDTA tubes.
• Specimens received later than 72 hours after collection.
• Samples with visible hemolysis or inappropriate volume.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Centrifuge
• Qubit Fluorometer
• Thermocycler (PCR machine)
• Digital PCR or Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) platform
• Microcentrifuge
• PCR workstation
Reagents:
• Cell-free DNA extraction kit (e.g., QIAamp Circulating Nucleic Acid
Kit)
• Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit
• KRAS Mutation Detection PCR Kit
• PCR Master Mix
• Primers and probes specific for KRAS codons 12, 13, 61, and 146
• Digital PCR reagents or NGS library preparation kit
• Water (nuclease free)
Supplies:
• Streck cell-free DNA BCT tubes
• Pipettes and pipette tips (filtered)
• 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes
• PCR tubes or plates
• Calibration and maintenance logs
4. PROCEDURE
Step 1: Plasma Preparation
• Centrifuge the blood sample at 1,600 x g for 10 minutes at 4°C to
separate plasma.
• Carefully transfer the top plasma layer to a new 1.5 mL
microcentrifuge tube.
• Re-centrifuge the plasma at 16,000 x g for 10 minutes at 4°C to
remove any remaining cellular debris.
• Transfer the supernatant plasma to another new 1.5 mL
microcentrifuge tube.
Step 2: Cell-free DNA Extraction
• Extract cell-free DNA from the plasma using the QIAamp
Circulating Nucleic Acid Kit according to the manufacturer’s
protocol.
• Elute the cell-free DNA in 30-50 µL of nuclease-free water.
Step 3: Quantification of Cell-free DNA
• Quantify the extracted cell-free DNA using the Qubit Fluorometer
and Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit.
• Record the concentration in ng/µL.
Step 4: PCR Amplification
• Amplify specific KRAS regions (codons 12, 13, 61, 146) using the
KRAS Mutation Detection PCR Kit.
• Prepare the PCR Master Mix according to the kit protocol and add
specific primers and probes for each KRAS codon.
• Add 5-10 µL of extracted cell-free DNA to the PCR Master Mix.
• Run the PCR thermal cycling program according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
Step 5: Mutation Detection
• Digital PCR:
◦ Prepare the reaction mixture for digital PCR according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
◦ Load the reaction mixture into the digital PCR instrument to
partition the sample.
◦ Perform thermal cycling and analyze the results using the
instrument's software to detect KRAS mutations.
• Next-Generation Sequencing:
◦ Prepare the sequencing library using the extracted DNA.
◦ Perform library preparation, target enrichment, and
sequencing as per the NGS platform protocol.
◦ Analyze sequencing data using bioinformatics tools to detect
KRAS mutations.
Step 6: Results Interpretation
• Review the digital PCR or NGS data for KRAS mutations.
• Interpret the results based on established thresholds for mutation
detection.
• Confirm any positive mutation results with repeat testing if
necessary.
Step 7: Quality Control
• Include positive and negative controls in each run to ensure assay
performance.
• Document all steps, including sample preparation, extraction,
PCR setup, and result interpretation in the laboratory information
management system (LIMS).
• Review control results to ensure they fall within acceptable limits.
Investigate and resolve any deviations before validating patient
results.
Step 8: Reporting Results
• Enter results into the laboratory information system (LIS) with
proper identification.
• Verify results by a qualified laboratory technologist.
• Ensure confidentiality and timely delivery of results according to
the established laboratory protocol.

Review and Validation: This SOP will be reviewed annually to
ensure all protocols are current and effectively implemented.
Feedback from laboratory staff will be incorporated into updates as
necessary.
