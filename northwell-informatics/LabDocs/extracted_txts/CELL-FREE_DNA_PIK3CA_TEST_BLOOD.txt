Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase Protocol for Cell-Free DNA PIK3CA Test,
Blood
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to provide detailed instructions for the
analytical phase of generating results for the Cell-Free DNA PIK3CA
Test, Blood in a clinical laboratory setting. This includes the
procedures to ensure accuracy, consistency, and reliability of test
results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
• Designated laboratory technologists and molecular biologists are
responsible for performing the test, monitoring the quality control,
documenting the procedure, and reviewing results.
• Laboratory supervisors are responsible for overseeing the
process, addressing any issues, and ensuring all protocols are
followed strictly.
3. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Real-Time PCR Instrument
• QIAamp Circulating Nucleic Acid Kit (QIAGEN) or equivalent
cfDNA extraction kit
• PIK3CA Mutation Assay Kit
• Calibrated pipettes and tips
• Sterile microcentrifuge tubes
• Vortex mixer
• Centrifuge
• PCR grade water
• Positive and negative controls
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENT
• Preferred Specimen: 10 mL of peripheral blood collected in Streck
tubes or equivalent cell-free DNA preservation tubes.
• Stability: Specimens must be processed within 24 hours if stored
at room temperature (15-25°C) or within 48 hours if stored at
2-8°C.
5. PROCEDURE
A) Extraction of Cell-Free DNA
a. Sample Preparation: - Centrifuge the Streck tube at 1600 x g for
10 minutes at room temperature. - Transfer the plasma to a clean
microcentrifuge tube without disturbing the cell pellet. - Centrifuge the
plasma at 16000 x g for 10 minutes at room temperature to remove
remaining cells and debris.
b. DNA Extraction: - Follow the detailed instructions provided in the
QIAamp Circulating Nucleic Acid Kit insert for cfDNA extraction. -
Ensure to use proper controls as outlined in the kit manual. - Quantify
extracted DNA using nanodrop or equivalent spectrophotometer to
ensure quality and concentration.
B) PCR Amplification
a. PCR Setup: - Prepare PCR reactions according to the PIK3CA
Mutation Assay Kit instructions. - Include controls (positive control
containing known PIK3CA mutation and negative control). - Load the
reaction mix into the Real-Time PCR instrument.
b. Cycling Conditions: - Follow the cycling conditions specified in
the PIK3CA Mutation Assay Kit, including initial denaturation,
annealing, and extension steps.
C) Data Analysis
a. Quality Control: - Verify that the positive control shows
amplification of the target gene and the negative control shows no
amplification. - Ensure all samples meet the amplification criteria
specified in the kit insert.
b. Result Interpretation: - Analyzing Real-Time PCR data using
proprietary software to determine the presence of PIK3CA mutations.
- Review Ct values and mutation-specific fluorescence signals. -
Confirmatory analysis for ambiguous results from duplicate testing.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
• Verify and review results and enter them into the LIS following
laboratory-specific guidelines.
• Report findings to the referring physician using standard formats,
including detected mutations and their clinical implications.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform and document internal quality controls daily, before
running patient samples.
• Comparative validation checks with known reference materials
monthly.
• Use duplicate samples and batch controls to ensure consistent
and accurate results.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to the PIK3CA Mutation Assay Kit insert for specific
limitations.
• Unacceptable specimens include those with visible hemolysis or
contamination.
• Inconsistent sample quality due to improper collection may lead to
unreliable results.

10. DOCUMENTATION AND APPROVAL
• This SOP must be reviewed annually or upon introduction of new
assay kits.
• Approval by the laboratory supervisor and director is required for
any amendments.
