Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Cell Count and Differential,
Body Fluid
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedures for performing manual cell counting and
differential analysis on body fluid specimens (e.g., cerebrospinal fluid
(CSF), pleural fluid, peritoneal fluid, pericardial fluid, synovial fluid) in
the laboratory. This protocol ensures accurate and timely results,
which are essential for diagnosing and monitoring various conditions.
Responsibility:
All designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing
manual cell counts and differential analysis on body fluid specimens
following this procedure. It is the responsibility of the laboratory
supervisors to ensure that the procedures are followed correctly and
to address any issues or discrepancies.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred: Freshly collected body fluid delivered to the laboratory in
the appropriate container within one hour of collection. Anticoagulant
(heparin or EDTA) may be used as specified.
Unacceptable:
• Specimens received more than one hour after collection without
anticoagulant.
• Specimens with gross hemolysis.
• Specimens with visible clotting.
• Samples without proper identification or labeling.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Preparation
1. Verify that the specimen is appropriately labeled and
corresponds with the requisition form.
2. Mix the specimen gently to ensure uniform distribution of cells.
3. If clots are present, note their presence and proceed with the
remaining unclotted portion of the sample.
B. Manual Cell Count
1. Prepare hemacytometer:
• Clean the hemacytometer and coverslip with 70% ethanol. Allow
to air dry.
• Place the coverslip on the hemacytometer.
1. Mix the specimen thoroughly, and using a pipette, charge the
hemacytometer chambers with the body fluid sample.
2. Allow cells to settle for 2-3 minutes. Place the hemacytometer
on the microscope stage.
3. Using a microscope at 10x or 40x objective:
• Count the total number of cells (nucleated cells - WBCs or RBCs
as indicated) in the appropriate counting area (4 large corner
squares for low cell count fluids, central large square for fluids
with higher cell counts).
• Calculate the cell concentration:
[ \text{Cell count per microliter} = \left( \frac{\text{Total number of cells
counted}}{\text{Number of squares counted}} \right) \times
\text{Chamber dilution factor} \times 10 ]
1. If the count is very high, dilute the sample with an appropriate
diluent (e.g., isotonic saline) and recount. Apply dilution factor in
the calculation.
C. Differential Count
1. Prepare a cytocentrifugation smear (Cytospin Technique):
• Gently mix the specimen.
• Deposit approximately 0.5-1 mL of the specimen into a
cytocentrifuge funnel.
• Cytocentrifuge the specimen following the manufacturer's
instructions (usually at 500 RPM for 5-10 minutes).
1. Alternatively, prepare a direct smear:
• Place a drop of the well-mixed body fluid onto a clean microscope
slide.
• Spread the drop evenly using another slide or cover slip to make
a thin smear. Air-dry the smear.
1. Staining:
• Stain the smear with an appropriate stain (e.g., Wright-Giemsa).
1. Review the stained smear microscopically under oil immersion
(100x objective):
• Perform a 100-cell differential count, identifying and categorizing
each cell type (e.g., neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes,
eosinophils, macrophages).
1. Report the differential count as percentages of each cell type.
D. Quality Control
1. Run quality control samples along with patient specimens as
per laboratory guidelines.
2. Review previous QC performance data to ensure consistency
and accuracy.
3. Retain documentation of QC results and take corrective actions
if QC results fall outside the acceptable range.
4. REPORTING RESULTS
• Document cell counts and differential results in the laboratory
information system (LIS).
• Refer to site-specific reporting guidelines for any additional
documentation or result transmission requirements.
• Critical results must be reported to the requesting physician or
healthcare provider immediately as per laboratory policy.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Cell counts may be affected by improper mixing, clotted samples,
and hemolysis.
• Differential analysis may be hampered by low cell counts or poor-
quality smears.
• Specimens contaminated with blood may lead to incorrect
differential results.
