Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase Protocol for Cell Count, Cerebrospinal Fluid
(CSF)
1. PURPOSE To establish a standardized procedure for the
accurate and reliable quantification of cells in cerebrospinal
fluid (CSF) specimens. This protocol ensures that cell counts
are performed consistently and in accordance with relevant
guidelines and regulations.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory technologists carry out and
document the cell counting of CSF as detailed in this procedure. It is
the responsibility of all staff to follow guidelines to maintain consistent
and accurate results and report any discrepancies or issues to a
supervisor.
1. DEFINITION Cell count in CSF includes the enumeration of red
blood cells (RBCs) and white blood cells (WBCs) per microliter
(µL) of cerebrospinal fluid.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS Preferred/acceptable:
• CSF specimens should be collected in sterile tubes, preferably
within 1 hour of collection to prevent cell degradation.
• The volume of CSF required for analysis is typically 1-2 mL.
Unacceptable:
• Specimens received in containers other than sterile tubes.
• Specimens that have been stored for extended periods under
suboptimal conditions.
• Specimens with visible clots or contamination.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Hemocytometer (e.g., improved Neubauer chamber)
• Microscope with appropriate magnification
• Turk’s solution (1% acetic acid with gentian violet or methylene
blue for WBC counts)
• Isotonic saline (0.9% NaCl) for diluting CSF
• Clean glass slides and coverslips
• Adjustable micropipettes and sterile tips
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
1. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
• Wear appropriate PPE, including gloves and lab coat, to prevent
contamination and exposure.
• Ensure that all equipment and materials are clean and ready for
use.
A. Sample Preparation:
1. If the CSF sample volume is insufficient for multiple tests,
prioritize cell count analysis.
2. Gently mix the CSF specimen by inversion to ensure
homogeneity. Avoid vigorous shaking to prevent cell lysis.
B. Manual Cell Counting:
1. WBC Counting: a. Mix CSF with Turk’s solution at a ratio of
1:10 (e.g., 10 µL CSF + 90 µL Turk’s solution). b. Load the
hemocytometer with diluted CSF. c. Allow cells to settle for 2-3
minutes. Ensure that the hemocytometer is properly filled and
the sample is evenly distributed. d. Using the microscope, count
the WBCs in the designated area (usually the four large corner
squares). e. Calculate the WBCs per µL using the formula:
WBC/µL = (Number of WBCs counted) × (dilution factor) /
(volume of counted area)
2. RBC Counting: a. Dilute CSF with isotonic saline if the RBC
count is high (standard dilution: 1:100). b. Load the
hemocytometer with diluted CSF. c. Allow cells to settle for 2-3
minutes. Ensure that the hemocytometer is properly filled and
the sample is evenly distributed. d. Using the microscope, count
the RBCs within the designated area (usually the center large
square with the smaller squares). e. Calculate the RBCs per µL
using the formula: RBC/µL = (Number of RBCs counted) ×
(dilution factor) / (volume of counted area)
C. Automated Cell Counting (if applicable):
1. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for the preparation and
loading of the CSF specimen into the automated cell counter.
2. Ensure that the analyzer is calibrated and quality control checks
have been performed prior to sample analysis.
3. Run the CSF sample and record the results provided by the
automated system.
4. QUALITY CONTROL:
• Verify the accuracy of cell counts by performing daily quality
control checks using control materials with known cell
concentrations.
• Document all QC results and take appropriate corrective actions if
results are outside acceptable limits.
• Perform and document regular maintenance and calibration of
counting equipment.
1. REPORTING RESULTS:
• Document cell counts in the laboratory information system (LIS)
or other applicable reporting systems.
• Review and verify the results before reporting. Any anomalies or
discrepancies should be reported to a supervisor immediately.
• Critical values should be communicated promptly to the
requesting health care provider following the lab’s critical result
policy.
1. REFERENCES:
• Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines for
cell counting in body fluids.
• Manufacturer’s instructions for the hemocytometer and automated
cell counters.
• Relevant scientific literature on CSF analysis and diagnostic
criteria.
1. DOCUMENT CONTROL:
• Ensure this SOP is reviewed and updated periodically per
laboratory policy.
• Document any changes to the procedure and communicate
updates to all relevant personnel.
By following this protocol, the laboratory can ensure a standardized
approach to CSF cell counting, leading to accurate and reliable test
results.
