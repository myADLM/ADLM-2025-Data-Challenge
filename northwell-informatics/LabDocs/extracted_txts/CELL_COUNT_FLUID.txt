Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for CELL COUNT, FLUID
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for performing and documenting
cell count analysis on body fluid specimens. This SOP ensures
accurate and reliable results for clinical decision-making.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND ACCEPTABILITY
• Preferred Specimen:
◦ Body fluid (e.g., cerebrospinal fluid, pleural fluid, synovial fluid,
peritoneal fluid, etc.)
◦ Collected in a sterile container
◦ Sample volume between 1 to 10 mL
• Unacceptable Specimen:
◦ Specimens collected in non-sterile containers
◦ Specimens with excessive clotting or hemolysis
◦ Specimens with labeling errors such as missing collection
date/time or patient identification
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Hemocytometer or automated cell counter
• Microscope (if counting manually)
• Sterile collection tubes
• Stains (e.g., Turk's solution, Wright’s stain if doing differential)
• Personal protective equipment (PPE) such as lab coat, gloves,
safety goggles
• Specimen logbook and patient result forms or LIS access for
electronic documentation
4. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation and Specimen Handling:
1. Wear appropriate PPE.
2. Ensure the specimen is properly labeled with patient
information, collection date and time.
3. Perform a visual inspection of the specimen. Note any turbidity,
color, or presence of clots in the logbook.
B. Cell Count using Hemocytometer:
1. Mix the specimen thoroughly by gentle inversion.
2. If performing a WBC/RBC count, dilute the specimen
appropriately with an isotonic solution or use a specific diluent
(e.g., Turk’s solution for WBCs).
3. Load the hemocytometer with the diluted specimen sample.
4. Under a microscope, count the cells in the specified grid areas
for WBCs and RBCs.
◦ For WBCs, count the four large corner squares.
◦ For RBCs, count the five small squares in the center large
square.
5. Calculate the cell concentration using the following formula:
◦ Cells/µL = (Number of cells counted × dilution factor) /
(volume of the counted area)
C. Automated Cell Counter:
1. Load the specimen into the automated cell counter according to
the manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Run the sample and obtain the total cell count, WBC
differential, and RBC count if applicable.
D. Differential Cell Counting (if applicable):
1. Prepare a smear of the specimen on a microscope slide.
2. Stain the slide using Wright’s stain or an equivalent.
3. Count and classify 100 cells under high-power magnification.
5. DATA REPORTING AND DOCUMENTATION
1. Record the results including total cell count, WBC differential,
and RBC count (if applicable) in the laboratory information
system (LIS) or manual logbook.
2. Ensure all specimen details, such as patient ID, specimen type,
collection date/time, and the name of the person performing the
count, are documented.
3. Verify the recorded data for accuracy before releasing the
report.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Ensure daily calibration and maintenance of the hemocytometer
and automated cell counter according to manufacturer’s
guidelines.
2. Perform internal quality control checks using known control
samples minimally once per shift or per laboratory policy.
3. Document and review all quality control processes and any
corrective actions taken in response to out-of-range QC results.
4. Participate in external proficiency testing programs, when
available, to ensure accuracy and reliability of test results.
7. TROUBLESHOOTING AND CORRECTIVE ACTIONS
1. If unusual or unexpected results are obtained, recheck the
sample preparation procedure, instrument calibration, and
reagents.
2. Reanalyze the specimen if necessary.
3. Consult with a supervisor or senior technologist in case of
persistent issues or equipment malfunction.
