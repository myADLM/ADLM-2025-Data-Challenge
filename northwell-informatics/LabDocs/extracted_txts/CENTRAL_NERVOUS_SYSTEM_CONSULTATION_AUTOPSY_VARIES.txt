STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP)
ANALYTICAL PHASE: CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM
CONSULTATION, AUTOPSY, VARIES
1. PURPOSE
To provide consistent and reliable procedures for the analysis of
central nervous system (CNS) tissue samples received from
autopsies. The purpose is to ensure accurate and reproducible
results for CNS consultations from various sources, including
systematic documentation and referencing.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
Lab personnel are responsible for handling and processing CNS
tissue samples in accordance with this SOP.
3. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all CNS tissue samples received for consultation
and analysis. These may include brain, spinal cord, and peripheral
nerve samples.
4. DEFINITION
CNS Consultation Autopsy: Analysis performed on CNS tissue
samples obtained during an autopsy to determine the presence and
extent of neurological disease or CNS abnormalities.
5. PROCEDURE
A. Tissue Receiving and Documentation
1. Upon receipt of CNS tissue samples, verify all information with
requisition forms.
2. Document the date and time of receipt and the condition of the
samples.
B. Triage and Gross Examination
1. Perform a gross examination to identify regions of interest,
recording macroscopic findings.
2. Document any visible abnormalities such as lesions,
discoloration, or gross structural changes.
C. Tissue Processing
1. Fixation: Immerse tissue samples in 10% neutral buffered
formalin for a minimum of 24-48 hours.
2. Processing: Follow standard laboratory procedures for tissue
embedding, sectioning, and staining.
3. Sectioning: Cut tissue slices at 4-5 microns for histological
examination.
4. Staining: Standard stains include Hematoxylin and Eosin
(H&E). Additional staining may include:
◦ Luxol fast blue (LFB) for myelin
◦ Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) for glycogen
◦ Bielschowsky silver stain for neurofibrils
◦ Immunohistochemistry (IHC) for specific markers (e.g.,
GFAP, MAP2)
D. Histopathological Examination
1. Microscopically examine stained slides to identify abnormalities.
2. Identify key structures: neurons, glial cells, blood vessels, and
presence of pathology such as gliosis, demyelination, and
neurodegeneration.
3. Document findings in detail, noting any patterns, distributions,
and intensities of abnormalities.
E. Special Studies
1. Electron microscopy may be used for ultrastructural analysis
when indicated.
2. Molecular analyses (PCR, sequencing) may be performed for
infectious agents, genetic mutations, or other molecular
diagnostics.
F. Reporting Results
1. Compile all findings into a comprehensive report.
2. Include micrographic images of key findings with descriptions.
3. Review findings with the supervisory pathologist for diagnostic
correlation and confirmation.
G. Quality Control
1. Include positive and negative control tissues in staining
protocols as per standard procedures.
2. Accuracy of histological and molecular techniques must be
verified with internal and external controls.
3. Document quality control measures in corresponding logs.
H. Storage and Disposal
1. Store tissue blocks and slides according to laboratory retention
policies.
2. Dispose of remaining biological materials in compliance with
institutional biohazard policies.
I. Documentation and Record Keeping
1. Maintain detailed records of all samples, procedures, findings,
and reports.
2. Ensure records are precise, up-to-date, and securely stored.
6. SAFETY
• Follow standard laboratory safety protocols, including proper PPE
usage.
• Handle all tissue specimens assuming they are potentially
infectious.
• Dispose of all biohazard materials appropriately.
7. REFERENCES
• Reference textbooks such as "Histology for Pathologists" for
histopathological procedures.
• Manufacturer protocols for histological stains and molecular
diagnostics.
• Laboratory-specific procedure manuals for detailed processing
instructions.
