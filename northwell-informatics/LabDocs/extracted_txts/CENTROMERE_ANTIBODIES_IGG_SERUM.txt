Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Centromere Antibodies,
IgG, Serum Assay
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for the quantitative determination of
Centromere Antibodies, IgG, in serum samples.
Responsibility:
The laboratory staff is responsible for performing the Centromere
Antibodies, IgG, serum assay according to this SOP and ensuring
accurate and timely reporting of results.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen Type:
Preferred: Serum
Unacceptable: Whole blood, plasma, hemolyzed serum, or serum
with visible microbial contamination.
Collection:
• Draw blood into a plain red-top or serum separator tube (SST).
• Allow the blood to clot for at least 30 minutes at room
temperature.
• Centrifuge at 1500-2000 g for 10-20 minutes to separate the
serum.
• Transfer the clear serum to a labeled polypropylene tube.
Storage and Stability:
• Serum samples are stable for up to 14 days at 2-8°C.
• For long-term storage, freeze at -20°C or lower. Avoid multiple
freeze-thaw cycles.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Automated immunoassay analyzer
• Micropipettes and tips
• Centrifuge
• Refrigerator and freezer for sample storage
Reagents:
• Centromere Antibodies, IgG, assay kit (including calibrators,
controls, and reagents)
• Appropriate diluents and buffers as specified by the assay kit
manufacturer
Supplies:
• Red-top or serum separator tubes (SST)
• Polypropylene storage tubes
4. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Check and confirm that all reagents and controls are within their
expiration date.
2. Prepare calibrators and controls according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
3. Set up the automated immunoassay analyzer according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
Assay Procedure:
1. Ensure the serum samples are at room temperature.
2. Perform any necessary sample dilutions as specified by the
assay kit manufacturer.
3. Load the serum samples, calibrators, and controls onto the
automated immunoassay analyzer.
4. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for running the
Centromere Antibodies, IgG assay.
5. Verify that the instrument calibration and quality controls are
within acceptable ranges.
Recording Results:
1. Results are automatically transmitted to the Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
2. Review and verify results for completeness and accuracy.
3. Document any aberrant or unexpected results and follow
troubleshooting procedures if necessary.
4. Verify and authorize the final results for reporting.
5. QUALITY CONTROL AND CALIBRATION
Quality Control:
• Run internal quality control samples with each batch of patient
samples to ensure assay accuracy.
• Control results must be within the manufacturer’s specified range
to validate patient results.
Calibration:
• Perform calibration of the automated immunoassay analyzer as
specified by the manufacturer.
• Document calibration results and any corrective action taken if
calibration fails.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
• Report results according to site-specific guidelines.
• Refer to the LIS for reporting requirements and detailed
instructions.
• Results outside the expected range must be flagged and
reviewed.
• Significant deviations or critical values must be communicated to
the appropriate clinical personnel promptly.
7. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Refer to the manufacturer’s assay kit insert for reference intervals
specific to Centromere Antibodies, IgG.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to the manufacturer’s assay kit insert for specific limitations
of the Centromere Antibodies, IgG assay.
• Recognize potential interferences including hemolysis, lipemia,
and microbial contamination.

10. REVIEW AND REVISION HISTORY
• Reviewed and updated October 2023
• Next review due October 2024 or within 30 days of any new
method validation or significant protocol change
