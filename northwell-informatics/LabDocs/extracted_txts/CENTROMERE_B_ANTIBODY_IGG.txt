STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase of Generating Results for CENTROMERE B
ANTIBODY, IGG
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this SOP is to define the steps for the
analytical phase of testing and reporting results for Centromere B
Antibody, IgG in the laboratory. This SOP ensures the accurate,
consistent, and reliable analysis of samples.
2. SCOPE This procedure applies to all personnel involved in the
analysis of Centromere B Antibody, IgG in the laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITIES
• Designated laboratory staff and technologists are responsible for
performing and documenting the analysis.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring compliance with this
SOP and addressing any discrepancies.
4. DEFINITION Centromere B Antibody, IgG (CENP-B Antibody, IgG)
is a specific autoantibody often associated with limited cutaneous
systemic sclerosis.
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred specimen type: Serum.
• Collection tube: Serum separator tube (SST).
• Volume: Minimum of 1 mL of serum.
• Handling: After collection, allow blood to clot, then centrifuge and
separate serum from cells. Store and transport refrigerated
(2-8°C).
6. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
• Centromere B Antibody, IgG assay kit (compatible with the ELISA
platform).
• ELISA reader (spectrophotometer).
• Micropipettes and tips.
• Multichannel pipette.
• Test tubes and racks.
• Incubation equipment (water bath or incubator).
• Disposable gloves and protective lab coat.
7. REAGENTS
• Centromere B Antibody, IgG ELISA reagents (coated microtiter
plate, wash buffer, substrate solution, stop solution, conjugate,
and standards/control).
• Dilution buffer.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
• Two levels of quality controls (positive and negative) must be
included in each run.
• Internal and external quality control procedures must be followed
to ensure analytical validity.
9. PROCEDURE
9.1 Preparation
1. Reagent Preparation:
◦ Bring all reagents and samples to room temperature before
use.
◦ Prepare wash buffer as directed in the kit insert.
◦ Prepare dilution buffer as required.
2. Sample Preparation:
◦ Centrifuge the serum samples if necessary to avoid any
particulate matter.
◦ Dilute the serum samples as specified in the kit instructions.
9.2 Assay Procedure
1. Plate Preparation:
◦ Remove the required number of strips from the microtiter
plate and place them in the frame.
◦ Label the plate properly.
2. Sample and Control Addition:
◦ Add 100 µL of standards, controls, and samples to the
appropriate wells.
◦ Perform all additions in duplicate (recommended).
3. Incubation:
◦ Incubate the plate for the specified time (typically 30-60
minutes) at room temperature.
4. Washing:
◦ Wash the wells 5 times with wash buffer. Ensure complete
removal of liquid after each wash to minimize carry-over.
5. Conjugate Addition:
◦ Add 100 µL of enzyme conjugate to each well.
◦ Incubate the plate for the specified time (typically 30-60
minutes) at room temperature.
6. Second Washing:
◦ Wash the wells 5 times with wash buffer.
7. Substrate Addition:
◦ Add 100 µL of substrate solution to each well.
◦ Incubate the plate for the specified time (typically 10-20
minutes) in the dark at room temperature.
8. Stop Reaction:
◦ Add 100 µL of stop solution to each well to stop the reaction.
9. Reading:
◦ Measure absorbance at 450 nm within 30 minutes of
stopping the reaction using the ELISA reader.
10. CALCULATION AND INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
1. Standard Curve:
◦ Generate a standard curve from the absorbance values of
standards using appropriate software.
2. Sample Results:
◦ Calculate sample concentrations by interpolating the
absorbance values from the standard curve.
3. Reference Range:
◦ According to the kit insert and clinical relevance.
11. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results should be reviewed and verified by a qualified
technologist.
• Report results in the LIS as per laboratory protocol.
• Critical values should be communicated to the physician
immediately as per lab policy.
12. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If QC results do not fall within acceptable limits, do not report
patient results, and investigate the cause.
• Reagent, sample, or instrument errors should be identified and
rectified.
13. DOCUMENTATION
• Record all results, QC outcomes, and any troubleshooting actions
taken in the appropriate logs.
• Maintain documentation as per laboratory record-keeping policies.
14. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions for Centromere B Antibody, IgG ELISA
kit.
• CLSI Guidelines for Immunology Methods.
15. REVIEW AND REVISIONS
• This SOP will be reviewed annually and updated as required to
reflect changes in methodology or regulations.
