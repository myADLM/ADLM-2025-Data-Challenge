Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Cephalosporium Acremonium, IgE, Serum.
1. PURPOSE
To outline the protocol for the analytical phase of generating results
for Cephalosporium Acremonium specific IgE levels in serum
samples.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing the
laboratory procedures as described in this SOP and ensuring
accurate and timely results. The laboratory supervisor is responsible
for the overall quality assurance and troubleshooting of any issues
that may arise during the analysis.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/acceptable: - Serum: 2-5 mL of serum collected in a gold or
tiger-top serum separator tube (SST) and allowed to clot at room
temperature. Centrifuge the tube within 1 hour of collection and
separate the serum.
Unacceptable: - Specimens not properly labeled. - Specimens
collected in the incorrect container. - Grossly hemolyzed, lipemic, or
icteric specimens. - Specimens with insufficient volume.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Primary Equipment: - Automated Immunoassay Analyzer (e.g.,
Phadia ImmunoCAP system).
Reagents and Controls: - Cephalosporium Acremonium-specific IgE
ImmunoCAP reagents. - IgE calibration standards. - Quality Control
(QC) materials (negative and positive).
General Supplies: - Pipettes and tips. - Vortex mixer. -
Microcentrifuge. - Glassware or plasticware appropriate for serum
handling. - Personal protective equipment (PPE).
Storage: - Store Cephalosporium Acremonium-specific IgE
ImmunoCAP reagents at 2-8°C. - Do not use reagents past their
expiration date. - Store serum samples at 2-8°C if analyzed within 48
hours; for long-term storage, samples may be frozen at -20°C or
lower.
1. PROCEDURE
Sample Preparation: 1. Centrifuge the serum separator tubes (SST)
for 10 minutes at 1500-2000 x g. 2. Aliquot the serum into
appropriately labeled microtubes if needed, avoiding transferring any
cells or debris.
Calibrators and Quality Controls: 1. Prepare calibration standards
and QC materials according to the manufacturer’s instructions. 2.
Load the calibrators and QC materials onto the immunoassay
analyzer.
Analyzer Setup: 1. Power on the immunoassay analyzer and allow it
to complete the system check. 2. Load the Cephalosporium
Acremonium-specific IgE assay reagents into the analyzer. 3.
Program the assay parameters into the analyzer as specified in the
instrument manual and reagent kit materials. 4. Ensure the analyzer
software is set to the correct assay protocol for Cephalosporium
Acremonium-specific IgE.
Running the Assay: 1. Load patient serum samples into the
designated slots on the analyzer. 2. Initiate the immunoassay run. 3.
Monitor the run for any automated alerts or system messages.
Address any issues as directed by the analyzer’s user manual.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
Internal Quality Control: - Run QC materials at the beginning of each
batch of patient samples, after any major maintenance, or if there are
any significant system alerts. - Assess the QC results to ensure they
fall within the acceptable range as defined by the manufacturer. If QC
fails, troubleshoot the issue before proceeding with patient sample
analysis.
Calibration: - Follow the manufacturer’s guidelines for running and
evaluating calibration standards. Perform calibration as required by
the manufacturer or whenever there is a reagent lot change.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
Result Verification: - Review the assay output from the immunoassay
analyzer. Confirm that control values are within the acceptable range.
- Verify patient results, paying special attention to any results that
appear inconsistent with the control values or previous patient history.
- Any flagged results or significant deviations from expected values
should be re-run for confirmation.
Result Documentation and Reporting: - Document all results in the
laboratory information system (LIS). Ensure legibility and accuracy of
the records. - Report patient results in the specified units (kU/L for
IgE) and include interpretative comments as necessary. - Refer to
site-specific guidelines for electronic or paper-based result
distribution.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to ImmunoCAP product insert for specific limitations of the
assay, including potential interferences and the dynamic range for
Cephalosporium Acremonium-specific IgE.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Reference intervals for Cephalosporium Acremonium-specific IgE
levels should be guided by clinical and patient-specific context.
Consult relevant clinical guidelines and literature.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING
If any issues arise during the immunoassay process, refer to the
immunoassay analyzer troubleshooting manual. Contact the
manufacturer's technical support if further assistance is needed.
