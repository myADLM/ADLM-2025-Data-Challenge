Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analysis of Ceramide
Trihexosides and Sulfatides in Random Urine Samples
1. PURPOSE
To provide a detailed and standardized procedure for the analysis of
ceramide trihexosides and sulfatides in random urine samples,
including guidelines for specimen handling, testing, quality control,
and reporting of results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
• It is the responsibility of the trained laboratory technologist to
follow this procedure and ensure accuracy, precision, and validity
of the results.
• Supervisors shall oversee the adherence to this protocol and
address any issues or non-conformities.
3. SPECIMEN COLLECTION AND HANDLING
Preferred/Acceptable Specimens:
• 10 mL random urine sample collected in a clean, sterile container.
• Specimens should be sent to the laboratory within 6 hours of
collection.
• If the urine sample cannot be tested immediately, refrigerate at
2-8°C. Bring to room temperature before analysis.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens arriving in the laboratory more than 6 hours after
collection without being refrigerated.
• Specimens without a collection date/time indicated on the sample
container or requisition form.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• LC/MS-MS (Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry) or
equivalent instrumentation
• Solvents and reagents: Methanol, acetonitrile, formic acid, and
water for LC/MS analysis
• Internal standard for quantitation
• Quality control materials for ceramide trihexosides and sulfatides
• Calibrators for ceramide trihexosides and sulfatides
5. PROCEDURE
A. PREPARATION
1. Calibration and QC Setup:
◦ Prepare calibration standards and quality controls according
to manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Perform instrument calibration using the prepared
standards.
◦ Run quality controls at the start of each batch to ensure
system integrity and reliability.
2. Sample Preparation:
◦ Mix each urine sample thoroughly before aliquoting.
◦ Pipette 1 mL of urine into a labeled centrifuge tube.
◦ Add internal standard to each sample.
◦ Vortex and centrifuge the samples at 10,000 rpm for 10
minutes.
◦ Transfer the supernatant to a clean vial for LC/MS analysis.
B. INSTRUMENT ANALYSIS
1. System Setup:
◦ Set up the LC/MS-MS system according to manufacturer
specifications and laboratory standards.
◦ Ensure that the LC parameters and MS settings are
optimized for the detection of ceramide trihexosides and
sulfatides.
2. Running the Samples:
◦ Load the prepared sample vials onto the LC/MS-MS
autosampler.
◦ Include calibration standards and QC samples within the
analytical run.
◦ Initiate the run and monitor system performance and data
acquisition.
C. DATA ANALYSIS
1. Data Processing:
◦ Process the acquired data using appropriate software.
◦ Identify and quantify ceramide trihexosides and sulfatides
peaks using the internal standard and calibration curve.
◦ Review the integration and ensure correct peak
identification and quantitation.
2. Quality Control Review:
◦ Verify that QC samples are within acceptable ranges.
◦ If QC results fall outside the defined limits, investigate and
resolve issues before reporting patient results.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Result Calculation and Entry:
◦ Calculate the final concentrations of ceramide trihexosides
and sulfatides in urine samples.
◦ Enter the results into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
2. Review and Verification:
◦ Review the results for accuracy and consistency.
◦ Verify the results according to laboratory protocols before
releasing them.
7. QUALITY CONTROL AND POTENTIAL ERRORS
1. Internal Quality Control:
◦ Include internal QC samples in each batch to monitor the
accuracy and precision.
◦ Document all QC results and corrective actions taken in
case of QC failures.
2. Troubleshooting:
◦ Address and troubleshoot any issues observed during
sample preparation, analysis, or data processing.
◦ Perform necessary instrument maintenance and re-
calibration if inconsistencies or errors are identified.
