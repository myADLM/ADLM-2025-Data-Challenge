Cerebellar Staining / GAD Antibody Testing Protocol
1. PURPOSE
This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) outlines the analytical
phase for the processing of specimens for cerebellar staining and
GAD antibody testing in the laboratory. This procedure ensures
accurate and reliable results for the clinical diagnosis of autoimmune
encephalitis and related conditions.
1. DEFINITIONS
GAD Antibodies: Glutamic Acid Decarboxylase (GAD) antibodies
are associated with autoimmune neurological disorders, including
autoimmune encephalitis and stiff-person syndrome.
Cerebellar Staining: Immunohistochemistry staining of cerebellar
tissue sections to detect the presence of specific antibodies.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of designated laboratory personnel to follow this
procedure accurately and ensure quality control measures are
adhered to throughout the analytical process.
1. SPECIMEN
2. Type:
◦ Serum or CSF (Cerebrospinal Fluid) for GAD antibody
testing.
◦ Cerebellar tissue for immunohistochemistry staining.
3. Storage and Stability:
◦ Serum: Stable at 2-8°C for up to 48 hours; for long-term
storage, freeze at -20°C or below.
◦ CSF: Stable at 2-8°C for up to 48 hours; for long-term
storage, freeze at -80°C.
◦ Cerebellar tissue: Fresh or snap-frozen tissue, stored at
-80°C or fixed in formalin and embedded in paraffin.
4. Unacceptable Specimens:
◦ Hemolyzed, lipemic, or improperly collected, stored, or
labeled specimens.

1. PROCEDURE
GAD Antibody Testing by ELISA:
1. Prepare all reagents and samples. Bring to room temperature.
2. Pipette 100 µL of patient serum or CSF into the antigen-coated
microtiter wells.
3. Incubate at room temperature for 1 hour.
4. Wash the wells 3 times with PBS.
5. Add 100 µL of blocking solution to each well. Incubate at room
temperature for 1 hour.
6. Wash the wells 3 times with PBS.
7. Add 100 µL of enzyme-conjugated secondary antibody to each
well. Incubate at room temperature for 1 hour.
8. Wash the wells 3 times with PBS.
9. Add 100 µL of substrate solution to each well. Incubate for the
recommended time until color develops.
10. Stop the reaction using the specified stop solution.
11. Read the optical density at the specified wavelength using a
plate reader.
12. Calculate the concentration of GAD antibodies in the samples
based on standard calibration curves.
Cerebellar Staining by Immunohistochemistry:
1. Section the cerebellar tissue at 4-5 µm thickness using a
microtome.
2. Place the sections on slides and heat at 60°C for 1 hour to
adhere the tissue.
3. Deparaffinize the sections and rehydrate through graded
alcohols to water.
4. Perform antigen retrieval by heating sections in a citrate buffer
pH 6.0 for 20 minutes in a microwave.
5. Block endogenous peroxidase activity by incubating sections in
3% hydrogen peroxide for 10 minutes.
6. Wash sections in PBS.
7. Block nonspecific binding with a protein blocker for 20 minutes.
8. Apply primary antibody to the sections and incubate overnight
at 4°C.
9. Wash sections in PBS.
10. Apply secondary antibody with chromogenic label and incubate
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
11. Wash sections in PBS.
12. Develop the chromogen and monitor under a microscope to
ensure appropriate staining.
13. Counterstain with hematoxylin, dehydrate, clear, and mount the
sections.
14. Examine the sections under a microscope and document
results.
15. QUALITY CONTROL
GAD Antibody Testing:
• Include positive and negative controls in each run.
• Perform calibration and maintenance of the plate reader as per
manufacturer’s instructions.
• Revalidate assay performance periodically and when any
reagents or antigens are changed.
Cerebellar Staining:
• Include sections with known positive and negative controls with
each batch of slides.
• Verify the specificity and sensitivity of each new batch of primary
and secondary antibodies.
• Document all deviations and corrective actions.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Review all results to ensure they are within the acceptable range
based on controls.
• For GAD antibody titers, report as positive or negative with
numerical values.
• For cerebellar staining, provide a detailed description of
immunostaining patterns and intensity.

ELISA.
1. SAFETY AND INFECTION CONTROL
• Follow all standard precautions and laboratory safety protocols.
• Handle all biological specimens and reagents as potentially
infectious.
• Dispose of waste according to biohazard regulations.
This protocol is effective as of October 2023 and reviewed annually
or when procedural updates are necessary.
