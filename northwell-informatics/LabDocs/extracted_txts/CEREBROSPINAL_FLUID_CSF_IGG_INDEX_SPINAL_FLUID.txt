Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF)
IgG Index
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedure
for the analysis of Immunoglobulin G (IgG) Index in
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). This procedure is used for the
assessment of intrathecal IgG synthesis, which provides
valuable diagnostic information regarding central nervous
system (CNS) diseases such as multiple sclerosis.
Responsibility: It is the responsibility of designated laboratory staff to
perform the analysis following this SOP. All staff must ensure that
proper quality control and documentation procedures are adhered to
throughout the analysis process.
1. DEFINITION The CSF IgG Index is a calculation used to
assess the production of IgG within the CNS. It is determined
by measuring the concentrations of IgG and albumin in both
CSF and serum.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS Specimens:
• Spinal Fluid: 1-2 mL CSF collected in a sterile container without
preservatives.
• Serum: 1-2 mL clotted blood to obtain serum.
Specimen Handling:
• Transport CSF on ice to the laboratory immediately post-
collection.
• Separate serum from clotted blood within 2 hours of collection
and store at 2-8°C if not analyzed immediately.
• Both CSF and serum can be stored at -20°C or below for long-
term preservation.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed or contaminated CSF.
• Specimens with labeled discrepancies.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Centrifuge
• Micropipettes and tips
• IgG and albumin assay kits (validated for both CSF and serum)
• Calibrators and control materials
• Analytical balance
• Water bath or heating block (if necessary per kit instructions)
• Refrigerated storage units
1. PROCEDURE A. Specimen Preparation:
2. Thaw frozen CSF and serum specimens at room temperature.
3. Mix well before analysis.
4. Centrifuge specimens to remove any particulate matter (3,000
rpm for 10 mins).
B. IgG and Albumin Assay:
1. IgG and albumin can be assayed using validated ELISA or
nephelometry methods.
2. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for sample handling,
assay procedure, and quality control.
3. Run controls and calibrators as required to validate results.
C. Calculation of CSF IgG Index:
1. Measure IgG and albumin concentrations in CSF and serum.
2. Record the values in mg/dL.
3. Calculate the IgG Index using the following formula:
[ \text{CSF IgG Index} = \left(\frac{\text{IgG}{CSF}}{\text{Alb}{CSF}}
\right) \div \left(\frac{\text{IgG}{Serum}}{\text{Alb}{Serum}}\right) ]
D. Quality Control:
1. Ensure that internal quality controls fall within the acceptable
range before releasing results.
2. Document all control measures taken and outcomes in the
quality control log.
3. REPORTING RESULTS
• Report the CSF IgG Index result to the nearest two decimal
places.
• Flag any abnormal results according to reference ranges: an
index >0.7 typically indicates significant intrathecal synthesis.
• Report results immediately to the clinician for patients with
abnormal indices.
• Refer to site-specific reporting guidelines for final verification and
documentation procedures.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolysis or contamination of CSF specimens may interfere with
the assays.
• Results should be interpreted in conjunction with other clinical and
laboratory findings.
