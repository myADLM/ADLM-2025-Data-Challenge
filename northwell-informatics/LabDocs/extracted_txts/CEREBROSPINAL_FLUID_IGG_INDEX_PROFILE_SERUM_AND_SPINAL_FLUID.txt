Analytical Phase Protocol for Generating Results of
CEREBROSPINAL FLUID IGG INDEX PROFILE, SERUM AND
SPINAL FLUID
1. PURPOSE:
To outline standardized procedures for the quantitative analysis of
Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) IgG Index Profile involving paired serum
and spinal fluid specimens. This procedure is intended to ensure the
accuracy, reliability, and consistency of the results.
Responsibility:
The designated laboratory staff must adhere to this procedure to
ensure accurate and reliable results. It is everyone's responsibility to
bring any procedural deficiencies or anomalies to the attention of the
supervisor.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES:
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes (automatic and manual)
• Analytical balance
• ELISA (Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay) reader
• Spectrophotometer, if required
• IgG index reagent kit
• Standard laboratory glassware and plasticware
• Quality control (QC) materials
• Consumables:
◦ Micropipette tips
◦ Tubes (microcentrifuge, cryo-vials, and test tubes)
◦ Reagent reservoirs
◦ Gloves and lab coat
◦ Distilled water
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS:
3a. Specimen Type:
• Serum
• Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF)
3b. Sample Collection and Handling:
• Serum: 5 mL of blood drawn into a serum separator tube (SST).
Allow the blood to clot for at least 30 minutes before
centrifugation. Centrifuge the sample at 1500 g for 10 minutes.
Transfer the clear serum to a labeled aliquot tube.
• CSF: A minimum of 2 mL of CSF should be drawn into a sterile
container and immediately delivered to the laboratory.
1. PROCEDURE:
4a. Specimen Preparation:
• Confirm that the specimens are labeled correctly with the patient's
identifier, collection date, and time.
• Allow refrigerated specimens to reach room temperature.
• Centrifuge any cloudy specimens at 1500 g for 10 minutes if not
already clear.
4b. Analytical Procedure:
• Using the manufacturer's guidelines, prepare the working
standards, controls, and reagents according to the IgG index
reagent kit instructions.
• Pipette the appropriate volumes of standards, controls, CSF, and
serum samples into wells/containers as outlined in the kit
procedure.
• Incubate the mixtures as specified by the kit instructions.
• Measure the absorbance of the samples at the specific
wavelength using an ELISA reader or spectrophotometer.
4c. Calculating the IgG Index:
• The IgG Index is calculated using the following formula: IgG Index
= (CSF IgG / Serum IgG) / (CSF Albumin / Serum Albumin)
Where:
• CSF IgG and Serum IgG are the IgG concentrations in the CSF
and serum.
• CSF Albumin and Serum Albumin are the albumin concentrations
in the CSF and serum.
4d. Quality Control and Validation:
• Run control samples (positive and negative) with each batch of
patient specimens to ensure proper assay performance.
• Ensure that QC results fall within the acceptable limits as
provided by the manufacturer. If QC fails, do not proceed with
patient sample analysis until the issue is resolved.
1. INTERPRETATION AND REPORTING OF RESULTS:
5a. Reference Intervals:
• IgG Index Reference Range: (Insert lab specific reference range)
5b. Reporting:
• All results should be documented in the LIS (Laboratory
Information System) following proper result entry protocols.
• Results are to be reviewed and verified by a qualified laboratory
technologist.
• Any critical or abnormal results must be flagged and promptly
communicated to the requesting healthcare provider.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
• Hemolyzed specimens may interfere with the assay.
• Lipemic or icteric serum samples may also affect results.
• Ensure that CSF and serum samples are collected within a short
period to minimize variations due to metabolic changes.
1. SAFETY AND SPECIAL PRECAUTIONS:
• Follow universal precautions for handling biological samples.
• Dispose of all biohazardous materials, such as used pipette tips
and tubes, in appropriate biohazard containers.
• Wear personal protective equipment, including gloves and a lab
coat, while handling specimens.
1. REFERENCES:
• Manufacturer's instructions for the IgG Index Reagent Kit
• Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines
• Relevant literature references specific to IgG index calculations
*Always ensure to consult the most recent version of the reagent kit
manual and refer to any updated laboratory standards or regulations
as necessary.
This protocol must be reviewed and updated periodically to reflect
any changes in laboratory practices or advancements in technology.
