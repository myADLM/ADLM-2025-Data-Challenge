Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedure for analyzing and
generating results for Cerebrotendinous Xanthomatosis (CTX) from
blood samples within the laboratory.
2. SCOPE
This procedure is applicable to all designated laboratory personnel
who are responsible for processing, analyzing, and reporting CTX
blood test results.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for the accurate and
timely analysis of blood samples for CTX. It is the responsibility of all
personnel to ensure compliance with this procedure.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Sample Type: Whole blood
• Preferred Collection Container: EDTA (lavender top) tube
• Volume: Minimum 4 mL whole blood
• Handling: Store and transport samples at 2-8°C.
• Unacceptable Conditions: Hemolyzed samples, samples older
than 48 hours after collection when not refrigerated, insufficient
volume.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Centrifuge (refrigerated)
• Automated or manual liquid handling systems
• Analytical balance
• Reagents and standards for targeted mass spectrometry or HPLC
analysis
• Quality control materials (both positive and negative controls)
• Calibration materials
• Pipettes and tips
• Laboratory information system (LIS)
6. EQUIPMENT MAINTENANCE
Routine calibration and maintenance of all lab equipment must be
performed as per the manufacturer's recommendations.
7. ANALYTICAL PROCEDURE
7.1. Pre-analytical Check
• Verify specimen integrity and labeling upon receipt.
• Check for any signs of hemolysis or improper storage conditions.
7.2. Sample Preparation
1. Centrifugation:
◦ Spin samples at 1500 x g for 10 minutes at 4°C to separate
plasma.
◦ Decant the plasma into a clean, appropriately labeled tube.
2. Extraction:
◦ Calculate the necessary reagents and consumables based
on the number of samples.
◦ Prepare samples and quality control materials according to
the specific reagent kit instructions.
◦ Vortex plasma samples and aliquot required volume for
analysis (e.g., 200 µL per reaction).
3. Internal Standard Addition:
◦ Add internal standard (IS) to each sample, control, and
calibration standard tube.
◦ Vortex briefly to mix.
4. Protein Precipitation:
◦ Add precipitating reagent to each sample and vortex
immediately.
◦ Allow standing for a specific time as per the manufacturer's
protocol.
◦ Centrifuge at 10,000 x g for 10 minutes at 4°C to obtain
supernatant.
5. Transfer Supernatant:
◦ Carefully transfer supernatant to clean tubes without
disturbing the pellet.
7.3. Analytical Step
1. Equipment Setup:
◦ Calibration of the instrument (e.g., LC-MS/MS, HPLC).
◦ Run calibration standards and quality control materials
before processing patient samples.
2. Injection:
◦ Load supernatants into the auto-sampler or inject manually.
◦ Follow specific instrument parameters and protocols for
CTX analysis.
3. Run Analytical Batch:
◦ Include a blank sample, calibration curve, quality control
samples, and patient samples.
◦ Adhere to the run order to prevent carry-over contamination.
7.4. Data Analysis
1. Data Acquisition:
◦ Collect data as per instrument-specific software.
2. Data Reduction:
◦ Analyze chromatograms or mass spectra.
◦ Calculate analyte concentration using the calibration curve.
3. Internal Review:
◦ Verify that all control samples fall within acceptable ranges.
◦ Repeat any sample analysis if control limits are not met.
7.5. Reporting Results
1. Data Review:
◦ Cross-check results against established reference intervals.
◦ Investigate any aberrant results (re-analysis if needed).
2. Result Entry:
◦ Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
3. Validation and Verification:
◦ Verify results by a qualified supervisory technologist.
4. Report Generation:
◦ Generate and print final report.
◦ Ensure reports follow site-specific reporting guidelines for
distribution.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run internal controls with each batch analysis.
• Document and review QC results.
• Investigate and resolve any QC failures prior to releasing patient
results.
9. DOCUMENTATION AND RECORD KEEPING
• Maintain proper documentation of all analytical runs, including
samples processed, reagents used, calibration curves, and QC
results.
• Document equipment maintenance, calibrations, and performance
evaluations.
10. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's protocol for specific reagents and instrumentation.
• Laboratory quality manual.
• Relevant peer-reviewed literature on CTX.
11. REVIEW AND APPROVAL
This document must be reviewed and approved annually or
whenever there are significant changes in the procedure, reagents,
or regulations.
