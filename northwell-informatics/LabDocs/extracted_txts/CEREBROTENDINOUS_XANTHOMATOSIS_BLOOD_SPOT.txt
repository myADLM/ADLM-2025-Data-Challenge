Standard Operating Procedure: Analytical Phase of Generating
Results for Cerebrotendinous Xanthomatosis (CTX), Blood Spot
1. PURPOSE
This document outlines the analytical procedures for the detection
and quantification of cholestanol levels in blood spot samples to aid
in the diagnosis of Cerebrotendinous Xanthomatosis (CTX). This
protocol ensures consistent processing, analysis, quality control
(QC), and reporting of cholestanol measurements.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
Laboratory technologists must follow this SOP to ensure accurate
and reliable results. Laboratory supervisors are responsible for
validating the results and overseeing compliance with this protocol.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
• Specimen Type: Blood spot collected on filter paper
• Collection Method: Use appropriate lancet to collect a sufficient
volume of blood to thoroughly saturate the filter paper
• Stability: Blood spots are stable at room temperature (15-25°C)
for up to 14 days. For long-term storage, store dried blood spots
at -20°C.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• High-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass
spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS)
• Solvents and reagents: methanol, acetonitrile, formic acid, water
(HPLC grade)
• Cholestanol standard
• Internal standards
• Extraction solvents
• Filter paper for blood spots
• Centrifuge
• Micro-pipettes with disposable tips
• Vortex mixer
5. PROCEDURE
Preparation and Extraction
1. Pre-Analytical Evaluation
◦ Inspect the blood spot to ensure it is properly saturated and
dried on the filter paper.
◦ Reject any specimens that are incompletely saturated or
poorly dried.
2. Extraction of Cholestanol
◦ Punch out approximately a 3.0 mm diameter disc from the
center of the blood spot.
◦ Place punched discs into a clean, labeled microcentrifuge
tube.
◦ Add [X] μL of internal standard solution to each tube.
◦ Add [Y] μL of extraction solvent (e.g., methanol:water, 80:20
v/v) to the tube.
◦ Vortex the tubes for 15 minutes to facilitate extraction.
◦ Centrifuge tubes at 12,000 rpm for 10 minutes. Carefully
transfer the supernatant to a clean, labeled vial for analysis.
HPLC-MS/MS Analysis
1. Instrument Setup
◦ Set up the HPLC-MS/MS system according to the
manufacturer’s specifications.
◦ Prepare mobile phases: Mobile Phase A (0.1% formic acid
in water) and Mobile Phase B (0.1% formic acid in
acetonitrile).
◦ Set the flow rate to [X] mL/min, and the column temperature
to [Y] °C.
◦ Program the HPLC gradient as follows:
| Time (mins) | Mobile Phase A (%) | Mobile Phase B (%) |
|-------------|---------------------|---------------------| | 0-2 | 90 | 10 | | 2-5 | 50 |
50 | | 5-8 | 10 | 90 | | 8-10 | 90 | 10 |
1. Sample Injection and Analysis
◦ Inject [Z] μL of the extracted sample into the HPLC-MS/MS
system.
◦ Analyze each sample, ensuring optimal resolution and peak-
shape for cholestanol.
Data Analysis and Interpretation
1. Quantification
◦ Use the internal standard method for quantification.
◦ Integrate peaks and calculate the concentration of
cholestanol using established calibration curves.
◦ Ensure the calibration curve meets accuracy and precision
criteria (coefficient of variation < 10%, R² > 0.990).
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include quality control samples (low, medium, high levels of
cholestanol) with each batch of patient samples.
• Perform system suitability tests before starting each analysis
batch.
• Recalibrate the instrument when calibration drift is observed or at
regular intervals as defined by the manufacturer's specifications.
• Review and document all QC results. If QC results fall outside the
acceptable range, identify and rectify the issue, and reanalyze
affected samples.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
• Record all raw and processed data in the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
• Report cholestanol concentrations in μg/mL or nmol/L.
• Results should be reviewed and verified by a designated
technologist before issuing final reports.
• Include reference intervals and interpretive comments where
applicable.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Blood spot samples with hemolysis or contamination may produce
spurious results.
• Extremely low or high hematocrit levels can affect the accuracy of
cholestanol measurement.
• Potential analytical interferences should be assessed and
controlled according to the guidelines.
