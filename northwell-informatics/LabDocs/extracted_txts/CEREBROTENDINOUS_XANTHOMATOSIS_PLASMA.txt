Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Analytical Phase of Generating
Results for Cerebrotendinous Xanthomatosis, Plasma
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this SOP is to outline the
procedures for the analytical phase of testing for
Cerebrotendinous Xanthomatosis (CTX) in plasma. This
includes the preparation, processing, and generation of results
for 27-hydroxycholesterol, cholestanol, and other relevant
biomarkers.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory staff are responsible for
adhering to and executing the procedures defined in this SOP. It is
the responsibility of all laboratory personnel to identify any
deficiencies in the testing process and bring them to the attention of
their supervisor.
1. DEFINITION Cerebrotendinous Xanthomatosis (CTX) is a rare
lipid storage disease characterized by abnormal storage of
cholestanol and other sterols in various tissues and organs. The
diagnosis is typically supported by measuring levels of 27-
hydroxycholesterol and cholestanol in plasma.
2. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Requirements and Stability
• Preferred specimen: 2 mL of plasma collected in EDTA or lithium
heparin tubes.
• Specimen storage: Plasma specimens should be stored at -20°C
and can be stable for up to 3 months if frozen.
• Handling: Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles for plasma
specimens. Specimens should be handled with care to prevent
contamination.
B. Reagents, Equipment, and Supplies
• HPLC or LC-MS/MS instrument
• 27-hydroxycholesterol and cholestanol standards
• Internal standards
• Methanol, acetonitrile, water (HPLC grade)
• Solid phase extraction (SPE) columns
• Calibration curves and controls specific to 27-hydroxycholesterol
and cholestanol
• Centrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Plasma centrifuge tubes
• Gloves and appropriate PPE
C. Preparation for Analysis
1. Thaw plasma specimens at room temperature.
2. Prepare standards and controls as per manufacturer's
instructions.
3. Centrifuge plasma specimens at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes to
remove any particulate matter.
4. Prepare SPE columns and equilibrate with appropriate buffer
solution.
D. Extraction and Processing
1. Load 200 µL of plasma specimen onto the SPE column.
2. Wash the SPE column with 1 mL of water, followed by 1 mL of
methanol.
3. Elute the target analytes with 1 mL of acetonitrile, and collect
the eluent.
4. Evaporate the eluent to dryness under nitrogen gas or in a
concentrator.
5. Reconstitute the residue in 100 µL of mobile phase (e.g., 70%
acetonitrile: 30% water).
6. Vortex the reconstituted sample for 30 seconds.
E. Instrument Setup and Calibration
1. Set up the HPLC or LC-MS/MS instrument as per the
manufacturer's instructions.
2. Run calibration curves for 27-hydroxycholesterol and
cholestanol.
3. Validate the instrument performance using quality control
samples.
F. Analytical Procedure
1. Inject 20 µL of the prepared sample into the HPLC or LC-MS/
MS instrument.
2. Analyze the sample under optimized conditions for the
detection of 27-hydroxycholesterol and cholestanol.
3. Record the retention times, peak areas, and other relevant
data.
G. Quality Control
1. Run quality control samples with every batch of patient
specimens to ensure accuracy and precision.
2. Check the calibration curves for linearity and acceptable
correlation coefficients.
3. Record any deviations and notify the supervisor.
H. Result Generation and Reporting
1. Quantify the levels of 27-hydroxycholesterol and cholestanol
using calibration curves.
2. Verify results against quality control data.
3. Input results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS) for
final review and verification.
4. Ensure that all results are reviewed by a qualified technologist
before being released.
I. Critical Values and Reporting
1. Establish reference intervals for 27-hydroxycholesterol and
cholestanol based on validated studies.
2. Document any abnormal or critical results and notify the
physician or healthcare provider as per laboratory policy.
3. Monitor and report any significant discrepancies immediately.
