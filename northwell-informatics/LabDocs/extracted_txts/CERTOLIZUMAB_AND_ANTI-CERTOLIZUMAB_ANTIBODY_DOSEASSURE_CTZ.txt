Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase:
Generating Results for Certolizumab and Anti-Certolizumab Antibody,
DoseAssure CTZ
1. PURPOSE
To establish a standardized protocol for generating and documenting
accurate results for Certolizumab and Anti-Certolizumab Antibody,
DoseAssure CTZ, ensuring reliability and reproducibility of patient
test results.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of the designated staff to carry out the
procedures as described herein and to ensure that all documentation
related to the test results is completed accurately and promptly.
1. DEFINITIONS
Certolizumab: A biologic drug used in the treatment of inflammatory
diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's disease.
Anti-Certolizumab Antibody: Antibodies that the body might produce
against Certolizumab, potentially impacting its effectiveness.
DoseAssure CTZ: A standardized assay used to determine the
concentration of Certolizumab and the presence of anti-Certolizumab
antibodies in a patient's sample.
1. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
• Certified centrifuge capable of achieving designated g-forces (see
below).
• DoseAssure CTZ assay kit (includes reagents, standards, and
controls).
• Micropipettes and appropriate tips.
• Vortex mixer.
• Microplate reader capable of reading absorbance at specific
wavelengths as indicated by the assay kit.
• Calibrated incubators set to specific temperatures as indicated by
the assay kit.
• Appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE).
• Disposable gloves, sterile containers, tubes, and microplates.
• Laboratory timer.
• Specimen aliquots (serum or plasma as indicated).
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred Sample Type: Serum or plasma.
• Collection Protocol: Blood should be drawn using standard
venipuncture techniques. Serum should be allowed to clot
completely, then centrifuged to separate the serum from the clot.
Plasma samples should be centrifuged promptly after collection in
the appropriate anticoagulant (as specified by the assay
manufacturer).
• Storage and Handling: Samples should be stored at 2-8°C if they
will be tested within 24 hours. For longer storage, samples should
be frozen at -20°C or colder and thawed completely before use.
1. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation and Setup:
1. Allow all reagents and samples to come to room temperature
(20-25°C) before use.
2. Label microplate wells for standards, controls, and patient
samples according to lab-specific guidelines.
3. Prepare diluted samples if required based on the assay kit
instructions.
B) Assay Procedure (as per the DoseAssure CTZ kit instructions):
1. Pipette the required volume of standards, controls, and
prepared patient samples into the appropriate wells.
2. Add the specified reagents in the order and volumes indicated
by the assay kit instructions.
3. Cover the microplate and incubate under the specified
conditions (temperature and time).
4. After incubation, wash the wells thoroughly as instructed to
remove unbound components.
5. Add substrate solution to each well and incubate for the
specified time to develop color.
6. Add stop solution to halt the color development.
7. Measure the absorbance of each well at the indicated
wavelength using the microplate reader.
C) Data Analysis and Interpretation:
1. Generate a standard curve by plotting the absorbance of the
standards against their known concentrations.
2. Use the standard curve to calculate the concentration of
Certolizumab and Anti-Certolizumab Antibody in the patient
samples.
3. Compare the patient results to the reference ranges provided in
the kit insert or determined by the lab.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include quality controls at multiple levels in each run to ensure the
accuracy and precision of results.
• Review quality control results against the established acceptable
ranges before reporting patient results.
• Document all quality control results and any corrective actions
taken if results fall outside the acceptable range.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Enter the patient results into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS), verifying accuracy and completeness.
• Interpret and report results according to the reference ranges and
clinical relevance outlined by the lab.
• Document any critical values and notify the appropriate
healthcare provider promptly following lab protocols.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to the manufacturer’s instructions for any specific limitations
of the DoseAssure CTZ assay.
• Report any noted interferences or anomalies during the assay
procedure.
1. REFERENCES
• DoseAssure CTZ assay kit insert and instructions.
• Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines.
• Laboratory Quality Management System procedures.
1. APPENDICES
• Include any additional protocols, flow charts, or worksheets for
tracking results and maintaining records.
• A comprehensive troubleshooting guide for common assay
issues.
By following the procedures outlined in this SOP, the laboratory
ensures consistent, accurate, and reliable results for Certolizumab
and Anti-Certolizumab Antibody testing using the DoseAssure CTZ
assay. Ensure all procedures are performed with compliance to CLIA
standards and laboratory best practices.
