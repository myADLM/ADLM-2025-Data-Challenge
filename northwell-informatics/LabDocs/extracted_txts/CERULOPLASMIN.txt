Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Analytical Phase -
Ceruloplasmin Testing
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this SOP is to detail the procedures for
analyzing and generating results for ceruloplasmin levels in patient
specimens to ensure accurate and consistent laboratory results.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen Type:
• Preferred Specimen: Serum
• Acceptable Specimen: Plasma collected in EDTA, heparin or
citrate tubes.
Specimen Handling:
• Specimens should be centrifuged to separate serum or plasma
within 2 hours of collection.
• Store separated serum or plasma at 2-8°C if not immediately
analyzed. Specimen is stable for up to 7 days at 2-8°C or for up to
1 month at -20°C or lower.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens that have been hemolyzed, lipemic, or not properly
handled.
• Specimens arriving at laboratory beyond the acceptable time
frames indicated for stability.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Required Equipment:
• Automated immunoassay analyzer (e.g., Roche Cobas, Beckman
Coulter)
• Centrifuge
• Refrigerator/freezer for specimen storage
Required Reagents:
• Ceruloplasmin reagent kit compatible with the immunoassay
analyzer being used.
• Calibrators and controls for ceruloplasmin assays.
• Deionized water (for reagent dilution if necessary).
Supplies:
• Pipettes and tips
• Sample tubes
• Personal protective equipment (PPE) for laboratory personnel
4. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Ensure all equipment is properly calibrated and maintenance
has been performed according to manufacturer specifications.
2. Review patient specimen for acceptability.
3. Allow all reagents, calibrators, and controls to reach room
temperature before use.
Calibration and Quality Control: 4. Calibrate the analyzer with
ceruloplasmin calibrators as per manufacturer’s instructions. 5. Run
quality control materials at three different levels (low, medium, high)
before patient specimen analysis to validate assay performance.
Acceptable ranges outlined by manufacturer must be met before
proceeding.
Specimen Analysis: 6. Load patient specimens onto the automated
analyzer according to the instrument protocol. 7. Enter specimen
identification details accurately into the instrument's system. 8. Follow
manufacturer instructions to initiate the ceruloplasmin assay.
Result Generation: 9. Upon assay completion, review and validate
the results generated by the analyzer. 10. Verify results against
quality control data to ensure accuracy.
Interpretation: 11. Reference Intervals: Typically, ceruloplasmin: 20–
60 mg/dL (confirm with site-specific intervals if different). 12. Any
results outside the reference intervals should be flagged and
reviewed.
Reporting Results: 13. Results should be reviewed by the
technologist, validated and then transmitted to the Laboratory
Information System (LIS). 14. Any critical results should be promptly
communicated to the ordering physician according to the laboratory’s
policy on critical results.
5. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Limitations:
• Ceruloplasmin levels can be influenced by acute-phase reactions,
pregnancy, and hormonal contraceptive use.
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric specimens may affect result
accuracy.
6. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s product insert for ceruloplasmin reagent kit.
• Laboratory-specific reference intervals and guidelines.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
Internal QC:
• Quality control checks should be carried out daily and
documented.
• Ensure periodic review and competency checks for laboratory
personnel.
External QC:
• Participate in proficiency testing programs to compare and
validate results with peer laboratories.
Documentation:
• Maintain comprehensive logs and records of calibrations, quality
control results, and specimen analysis.
8. SAFETY
PPE:
• Laboratory personnel must wear gloves, laboratory coat, and eye
protection when handling specimens and reagents.
Other Safety Measures:
• Follow all biosafety and chemical safety protocols as outlined in
the laboratory safety manual.
9. TROUBLESHOOTING
Analyte Failure:
• If QC fails, do not proceed with patient samples until the issue is
resolved.
• Contact technical support as necessary for instrument-specific
troubleshooting.
Results Review:
• Investigate any unexpected results, including possible specimen
integrity issues or assay interference.
• Repeat analysis if necessary and consult a supervisor for
persistent problems.
Document Revision History:
• Record and periodically review SOP updates and revisions.
