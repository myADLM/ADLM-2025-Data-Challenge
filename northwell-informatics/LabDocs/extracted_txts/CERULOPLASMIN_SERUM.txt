Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase Protocol for Generating Results for
Ceruloplasmin, Serum
1. PURPOSE To ensure accurate and reliable measurement of
ceruloplasmin levels in serum specimens in the clinical
laboratory.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing
the ceruloplasmin analysis according to this SOP.
• Laboratory supervisors ensure that the protocol is followed and
address any deviations or issues related to the procedure.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Preferred Specimen:
• Serum collected in a red-top or serum separator tube (SST).
• Minimum volume: 0.5 mL
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Specimens with hemolysis or gross lipemia.
• Specimens in tubes containing anticoagulants such as EDTA,
heparin, or citrate.
• Specimens not properly labeled or collected longer than 24 hours
before analysis without proper storage.
Specimen Stability:
• Refrigerated (2-8°C): Stable for up to 14 days.
• Frozen (-20°C or lower): Stable for up to 3 months. Avoid
repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Reagents:
• Ceruloplasmin calibrators and controls from a certified
manufacturer.
• Ceruloplasmin reagent from manufacturer packaging insert.
Equipment:
• Automated chemistry analyzer capable of ceruloplasmin
determination.
• Refrigerated centrifuge.
• Pipettes and tips.
Supplies:
• Serum separator tubes (SST) or red-top tubes.
• Calibration and control materials.
• Sample cups or racks.
1. PROCEDURE
2. Specimen Processing:
◦ Allow SST tubes to clot for at least 30 minutes at room
temperature.
◦ Centrifuge the SST tubes at 1500-2000 x g for 10 minutes.
◦ Transfer separated serum to appropriately labeled
secondary tubes if necessary.
3. Calibration and Quality Control:
◦ Calibrate the analyzer using ceruloplasmin calibrators as
per manufacturer instructions.
◦ Run quality control materials at the beginning of each shift,
and after any maintenance or calibration procedure.
4. Sample Analysis:
◦ Load the specimens onto the automated analyzer according
to the instrument's loading protocol.
◦ Perform ceruloplasmin measurements according to the
manufacturer’s instructions for the ceruloplasmin reagent.
◦ Ensure each sample’s identification matches with the input
data on the analyzer.
5. Result Interpretation and Reporting:
◦ Review the analyzer output for each sample carefully
ensuring there are no flags or issues.
◦ Verify results against quality control ranges. If any QC
failures are detected, troubleshoot and re-analyze samples
if necessary.
◦ Transfer verified results to the LIS system for final reporting.
◦ Critical values should be reported immediately to the
physician as per laboratory protocol.
6. Quality Control:
◦ Run intra-laboratory quality control, using pooled patient
samples and commercial QC materials.
◦ Cross-check new reagent lots for consistency against
current certified materials.
◦ Document all QC results and any corrective actions taken
for out-of-range findings.
7. Method Limitations: Refer to the manufacturer's package insert
for ceruloplasmin reagent for information on specific limitations
of the method.
8. REFERENCE INTERVALS:
Ceruloplasmin reference intervals are generally:
• Adult: 20 – 60 mg/dL
• Pediatric ranges might differ; refer to the manufacturer's packet
insert or established lab norms.
1. REPORTING RESULTS:
• Follow site-specific guidelines for entering and reviewing results.
• Report any result out of the normal reference intervals as flagged
results within the LIS.
• Document any deviations or issues.
