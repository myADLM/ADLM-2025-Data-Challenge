SOP for Analytical Phase of Generating Results for Chaetomium
globosum, IgE, Serum
1. Purpose To provide standardized procedures for the analytical
phase of testing and reporting IgE levels specific to
Chaetomium globosum in serum samples.
2. Specimen Requirements
◦ Preferred/acceptable: 3-5 mL serum collected using
standard venipuncture techniques. The specimen should be
stored and transported at 2-8°C if testing is not immediately
performed. Serum should be separated from blood cells as
soon as possible.
◦ Unacceptable: Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
Specimens received in conditions other than serum.
3. Equipment, Reagents and Supplies
◦ ImmunoCAP test system (or another FDA-approved IgE
testing system for Chaetomium globosum)
◦ Controls: IgE Positive and Negative controls
◦ Calibrators: Manufacturer-provided calibrators for IgE assay
◦ Standard laboratory equipment: Centrifuge, micropipettes,
serological pipettes, vortex mixer, refrigerator, and freezer
◦ Laboratory software for data collection and result reporting
4. Preparation for Testing
◦ Verify all reagents, controls, and calibrators are within their
expiration dates.
◦ Ensure the IgE test system has been properly calibrated
according to manufacturer instructions.
◦ Prepare serum samples by centrifuging whole blood to
obtain serum, transfer to clean, appropriately labeled
sample tube.
5. Procedure
◦ Follow manufacturer's instructions for setting up and
operating the ImmunoCAP test system.
◦ Load calibrators, controls, and patient serum samples onto
the testing platform.
◦ Start the analytical run according to the system protocol.
6. Quality Control
◦ Run internal positive and negative controls with every batch
of patient samples.
◦ Verify that control values fall within expected ranges before
proceeding with patient sample analysis.
◦ Document the lot number, expiration date, and results of all
controls alongside the testing batch.
7. Analyte Measurement and Result Generation
◦ Allow the assay to run its complete cycle and the system to
generate values for Chaetomium globosum-specific IgE
levels in each serum sample.
◦ Patient IgE results will be automatically calculated by the
testing apparatus.
◦ Review the generated data for correct qualitative and
quantitative determinations.
8. Troubleshooting and Corrective Actions
◦ If controls are out of range, halt testing and recheck
instrument setup, reagents, and calibration. Repeat control
tests before continuing.
◦ For instrument error messages or flagged results, refer to
the troubleshooting guide in the manufacturer's manual.
◦ In case of persistent issues, contact the on-call supervisor
for further instructions.
9. Reporting Results
◦ Verify the integrity and accuracy of data before transmitting
to the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
◦ Report results according to site-specific guidelines, ensuring
proper documentation of critical values and discrepancies.
10. Reference Intervals
• Use manufacturer-recommended reference intervals for specific
IgE levels. Refer to ImmunoCAP insert for detailed reference
values for Chaetomium globosum IgE.
1. Method Limitations
• Refer to ImmunoCAP system insert for limitations specific to the
IgE assay, including possible cross-reactivity with other allergens.
1. Documentation and Records
• All test procedures, control results, calibrator usage, and
instrument maintenance activities should be documented
according to laboratory policy.
• Ensure patient results are properly logged into LIS with
appropriate annotations and comments on sample integrity, if
necessary.
1. References
• Manufacturer's instruction manual and product insert for the
ImmunoCAP system used.
• Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines for
IgE testing.
• Peer-reviewed literature on the immunological detection of
Chaetomium globosum-specific IgE.
Notes: This SOP is designed to standardize and guide the analytical
processing of serum samples for Chaetomium globosum-specific IgE
testing using an ImmunoCAP system or equivalent. Adjustments and
enhancements may be needed based on specific laboratory
operations and updated clinical guidelines.
