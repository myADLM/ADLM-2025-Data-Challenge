Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Chagas Disease
Serology Testing
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the steps required for the analysis of serum
samples for the detection of Chagas disease using serological testing
methods. This procedure ensures accurate and reliable results are
generated for the diagnosis of Chagas disease.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory technologists are responsible for carrying out
the test procedures as per the protocol. Supervisors must ensure
proper training of staff, adherence to the SOP, and validation of
results. It is the responsibility of the laboratory personnel to report
any deviations or issues encountered during the testing process.
3. DEFINITIONS
Chagas Disease: A tropical parasitic disease caused by the
protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi. Serology: A branch of laboratory
medicine that deals with the detection of antibodies or antigens in
serum.
4. PROCEDURE
4.1 Equipment and Reagents
• Microplate reader capable of reading at 450 nm and 620-650 nm
• Pipettes (single-channel and multi-channel)
• Disposable pipette tips
• Vortex mixer
• Incubator (37°C)
• Wash bottle or microplate washer
• 1X Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS)
• ELISA (Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay) kit for Chagas
disease or other approved serological test kits
• Distilled or deionized water
• Laboratory timer
4.2 Preparation of Reagents
• Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for the preparation of
reagents included in the ELISA kit or other approved test kit.
• Prepare wash buffer by diluting the 10X wash buffer concentrate
with distilled or deionized water.
• Allow all reagents supplied with the kit to reach room temperature
before use.
4.3 Specimen Requirements and Handling
• Specimens: Serum samples (minimum 0.5 mL)
• Specimen Stability: Serum samples should be kept refrigerated at
2-8°C and are stable for up to 7 days. For longer storage,
specimens should be frozen at -20°C or lower.
• Unacceptable Specimens: Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples;
samples collected in sodium citrate, EDTA, or heparin tubes.
4.4 Test Procedure
Note: Follow biosafety guidelines when handling clinical specimens
and perform all assays according to good laboratory practices.
1. Sample Preparation
◦ Thaw frozen serum samples at room temperature and mix
well. Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
◦ Centrifuge samples if particulate matter is visible (e.g., 10
minutes at 1500 RPM).
2. Assay Setup
◦ Label the microplate, identifying standards, controls, and
patient samples.
◦ Pipette the required volume (as per kit instructions, typically
100 µL) of serum samples, positive control, negative control,
and standards into appropriate wells of the microplate.
◦ Add the assay buffer to each well (as recommended by the
kit protocol).
3. Incubation
◦ Seal the plate with an adhesive cover and incubate the
microplate at 37°C for the specified duration (typically 60
minutes).
4. Washing
◦ Wash the microplate wells using the wash buffer to remove
unbound materials. Perform multiple wash cycles (e.g., 4-6
times) as per kit instructions.
5. Conjugate Addition
◦ Add the enzyme conjugate (anti-human IgG or specific to
the patient antigen) to each well.
◦ Incubate the plate at the specified temperature and duration.
6. Substrate Addition
◦ Add the substrate solution to each well. Allow the color to
develop by incubating at room temperature (typically 20-30
minutes), protected from light.
7. Stopping the Reaction
◦ Add the stop solution to each well to halt the enzymatic
reaction. The color change should be immediate and stable
for measurement.
8. Reading the Microplate
◦ Measure the optical density (OD) of each well at 450 nm
with a reference wavelength of 620-650 nm using a
microplate reader.
4.5 Result Interpretation
• Calculate the mean OD values for the standards and controls.
• Generate a calibration curve by plotting the OD values of the
standards against their concentrations.
• Determine the OD cut-off value based on the negative and
positive control values supplied with the test kit.
• Compare the OD of patient samples to the cut-off value.
◦ Samples with OD values above the cut-off are considered
positive.
◦ Samples with OD values below the cut-off are considered
negative.
◦ Samples with OD values in the gray zone (if defined by the kit)
should be retested or confirmed using a secondary method.
4.6 Quality Control and Validation
• Perform quality control checks with each assay run using positive
and negative controls included in the test kit.
• Ensure proper documentation of the calibration curve, QC results,
kit lot numbers, and expiration dates.
• Deviations from expected control values necessitate
troubleshooting and assay repeat.
4.7 Reporting Results
• Document patient results in the laboratory information system
(LIS) and ensure validation by the supervising technologist.
• Critical or unusual results should be reviewed and released
according to laboratory protocol.
5. REPORTING CRITERIA
• Indeterminate or questionable results should be flagged, and a
repeat test or alternative confirmatory test should be
recommended.
• A comprehensive report, including the interpretative comments
and any further recommendations, should be prepared per
laboratory policy.
6. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's instructions for the specific ELISA kit or approved
test kit used.
• Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines.
• Relevant peer-reviewed articles and laboratory manuals.
7. SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS
• Handle all specimens as potentially infectious.
• Properly dispose of biohazardous materials according to
established protocols.
• Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) at all
times.
By adhering to this SOP, laboratory personnel will ensure accurate
and timely testing for Chagas disease, maintaining high standards of
laboratory practice and patient care.
