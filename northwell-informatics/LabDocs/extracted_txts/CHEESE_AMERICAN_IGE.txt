Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for CHEESE AMERICAN
IGE Determination
1. PURPOSE
This SOP describes the steps to be performed to accurately
determine and report Cheese American Immunoglobulin E (IgE)
levels in patient serum samples using the designated immunoassay
methodology.
Responsibility:
• It is the responsibility of designated laboratory personnel to
adhere to this SOP to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the
IgE testing process.
• Supervisors must ensure that all staff are trained and comply with
this SOP.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/Acceptable Specimen:
• Serum: Collect blood in a serum separator tube (SST). Allow the
blood to clot at room temperature for 30 minutes, then centrifuge
at 1500-2000 x g for 10 minutes to obtain serum.
• Minimum volume required: 0.5 mL of serum.
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Specimens that are hemolyzed, hyperlipidemic, or contaminated.
• Specimens received in tubes other than SST (e.g., EDTA,
heparin).
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Immunoassay analyzer (designated model, e.g., Phadia 250)
• Cheese American-specific IgE reagent kit
• Calibrators and controls for Cheese American IgE
• Micropipettes and tips
• Serum separator tubes (SST)
• Centrifuge
• Timer
• PPE (personal protective equipment)
4. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation:
1. Ensure that all reagents, controls, and calibrators are within the
expiration date and have been stored according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
2. Bring all reagents and samples to room temperature (20-25°C)
before starting the assay.
B. Calibration:
1. Perform calibration as required by the immunoassay analyzer,
using the designated calibrators provided by the reagent kit.
2. Document the calibration details, including date, time, and
initials of the operator.
C. Quality Control (QC):
1. Run the appropriate QC materials at the beginning of each run,
after any system maintenance, and with each new lot of
reagents.
2. Acceptable QC ranges should be determined based on
historical data and manufacturer recommendations. Document
QC results.
3. If QC results are out of range, troubleshoot according to the
immunoassay analyzer manual and repeat until all QC results
are within acceptable ranges.
D. Sample Processing:
1. Label the samples clearly with patient identifiers.
2. Load the serum samples, calibrators, and QC materials into the
immunoassay analyzer.
3. Follow the analyzer-specific instructions to run the Cheese
American IgE assay.
E. Running the Assay:
1. Select the Cheese American IgE assay protocol on the
immunoassay analyzer.
2. Start the automated run and ensure that the analyzer performs
the necessary steps, including incubation, washing, and
reading.
3. Monitor the system for any errors or issues during the run.
Address any alerts according to the manufacturer's
troubleshooting guide.
F. Results Generation:
1. Once the run is completed, review the assay results and ensure
that all controls and calibrators meet the acceptance criteria.
2. Transfer results to the Laboratory Information System (LIS) for
recording and reporting.
3. Verify and validate the results according to laboratory protocol
before releasing them.
5. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results must be reviewed and verified by a qualified technologist.
• Ensure all results are accurate and correlate with the QC data.
• Critical results should be communicated to the clinician
immediately according to the lab’s critical value policy.
6. INTERPRETATION AND LIMITATIONS
Reference Intervals:
• The normal range for Cheese American IgE will be provided in the
reagent kit insert.
Limitations:
• Potential interferences: High levels of heterophilic antibodies or
cross-reactivity with other IgE may give false results.
• Results should be interpreted in conjunction with clinical findings
and other laboratory tests.

• Manufacturer’s reagent kit insert for Cheese American IgE.
• Immunoassay analyzer (Phadia 250) user manual.
• Laboratory Quality Assurance protocols.
8. DOCUMENTATION
• Record calibration, QC results, patient results, and any corrective
actions taken in case of QC failures.
• Ensure proper documentation for traceability and quality
management.
9. SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS
• Follow all safety guidelines for handling human specimens and
operating immunoassay equipment.
• Wear appropriate PPE (gloves, lab coat, eye protection) during
sample handling and assay procedures.
