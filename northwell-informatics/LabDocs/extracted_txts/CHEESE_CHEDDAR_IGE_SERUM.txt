Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for CHEESE, CHEDDAR, IGE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedures and protocols for the analysis and
generation of results for the CHEESE, CHEDDAR, and IGE tests
using serum specimens to ensure accurate and reliable results.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of designated laboratory staff to follow this SOP
during the analytical phase and to identify and report any issues that
may affect the quality of test results to the supervising technologist.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type:
• Serum
Specimen Collection and Handling:
• Collect blood in a serum separator tube (SST).
• Allow the blood to clot for 20-30 minutes at room temperature.
• Centrifuge the SST at 3,000 RPM for 10 minutes to separate the
serum.
• Transfer the serum to a properly labeled transport tube for
analysis.
Specimen Stability:
• Specimens are stable for up to 48 hours when stored at 2-8°C.
• If analysis is delayed beyond 48 hours, freeze the serum aliquots
at -20°C or colder.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Chemiluminescent Immunoassay (CLIA) analyzer or Enzyme-
Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) instruments
• Pipettes and tips
• Centrifuge
• Incubator (if required by the assay protocol)
• Reagent kits for CHEESE, CHEDDAR, and IGE assays
• Optical plates (if required by the assay protocol)
• Quality control materials
4. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation for Analysis:
1. Ensure all specimens, reagents, and control materials are at
room temperature before starting the assay.
2. Check expiration dates on all reagents and quality control
materials.
3. Calibrate the CLIA analyzer or ELISA instrument according to
the manufacturer's instructions.
B. Running the Assay:
CHEESE and CHEDDAR Assays:
1. Load serum samples, calibrators, and quality control materials
onto the analyzer or optical plates according to the assay
protocol.
2. Add specific reagents for the CHEESE or CHEDDAR assay to
each well or sample slot.
3. Follow the instrument's method for incubation, washing, and
detection steps.
4. Record the optical density or chemiluminescence readings.
IGE Assay:
1. Apply the same procedures as the CHEESE and CHEDDAR
assays, using reagents specific to the IGE assay.
2. Ensure proper incubation periods and washing steps are
followed.
3. Record the readings provided by the analyzer.
C. Interpretation of Results:
1. Utilize the calibration curve generated by the calibrators to
determine the concentration of CHEESE, CHEDDAR, and IGE
in the serum samples.
2. Analyze the quality control results to verify the assay's accuracy
and precision. Ensure QC results fall within the acceptable
range.
D. Documentation and Reporting:
1. Document all steps taken, including sample identification,
reagent lot numbers, calibration data, and QC results.
2. Transmit results to the Laboratory Information System (LIS) for
review and verification.
3. Review and verify results in the LIS before releasing them for
clinical interpretation.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Quality control materials at different concentration levels must
be included in every run.
2. Document and review QC results according to the laboratory’s
guidelines.
3. In case of QC failure, identify the issue, troubleshoot, and re-
run controls or samples as necessary.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Results are automatically transmitted to the LIS and must be
reviewed before verification.
2. Report critical results immediately following the laboratory’s
policy and procedures.
3. Ensure the integrity of the results by verifying with repeat
testing if necessary.
7. MAINTENANCE AND CALIBRATION
1. Perform regular maintenance and calibration of the analyzers
as per the manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Document all maintenance and calibration activities.
