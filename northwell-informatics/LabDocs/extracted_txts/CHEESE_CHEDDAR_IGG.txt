Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for CHEESE CHEDDAR
IGG Assay
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedures for the assay of CHEESE CHEDDAR IgG
to ensure reliable and accurate generation of laboratory results. This
procedure is applicable to all laboratory personnel performing the
assay.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of designated laboratory personnel to perform,
document, and validate the CHEESE CHEDDAR IgG assay
according to this SOP. Quality control (QC) and result verification are
to be performed by the laboratory supervisor or designated senior
staff.
1. PROCEDURE
2.1 Reagents and Equipment
2.1.1 Reagents:
• CHEESE CHEDDAR IgG ELISA Kit
• Calibrators and Controls
• Wash Buffer
• Substrate Solution (TMB)
• Stop Solution
• Sample Diluent
2.1.2 Equipment:
• ELISA Reader
• Microplate Washer
• Precision Pipettes and Tips
• Microplate
• Incubator (37°C)
• Calibrated Timer
2.2 Specimen Requirements:
• Preferred specimen: Serum or plasma, collected in standard red-
top or lavender-top (EDTA) tubes.
• Minimum volume required: 0.5 mL.
• Specimen stability: Process the specimen within 2 hours of
collection or store at 2-8°C for up to 48 hours. For long-term
storage, freeze at -20°C.
2.3 Specimen Acceptance/Rejection Criteria:
• Acceptable: Properly labeled and adequately filled tubes.
• Unacceptable: Hemolyzed, lipemic, or improperly labeled
specimens.
2.4 Preparation:
2.4.1 Bring all reagents and specimens to room temperature before
starting the assay.
2.4.2 Set up the ELISA reader and washer according to manufacturer
instructions.
2.4.3 Assign positions for controls, calibrators, and specimens on the
microplate.
2.5 Assay Procedure:
2.5.1 Sample Addition:
• Add 100 µL of sample diluent to each well.
• Add 10 µL of calibrators, controls, and specimens to each
corresponding well.
• Incubate the plate for 60 minutes at 37°C.
2.5.2 Washing:
• Wash the plate 3 times with 300 µL of wash buffer for each cycle.
• Tap the plate on absorbent paper to remove residual liquid.
2.5.3 Conjugate Addition:
• Add 100 µL of conjugate solution to each well.
• Incubate for 30 minutes at 37°C.
2.5.4 Substrate Addition:
• Add 100 µL of TMB substrate solution to each well.
• Incubate for 15 minutes at room temperature in the dark.
2.5.5 Stopping Reaction:
• Add 50 µL of stop solution to each well to terminate the reaction.
• Gently tap the plate to mix.
2.6 Reading the Plate:
• Measure the absorbance of each well using the ELISA reader at
450 nm within 10 minutes of adding the stop solution.
2.7 Quality Control:
• Run both positive and negative controls with each assay batch.
• If the control values fall within the established range, proceed to
result validation.
• If controls fall outside the range, review all steps and repeat the
assay.
2.8 Calculation of Results:
• Generate a standard curve from the calibrators.
• Calculate the concentration of CHEESE CHEDDAR IgG in each
specimen using the standard curve.
• Report results in IU/mL.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results will be reviewed and validated by the technologist.
• Document all findings, including QC results, on the appropriate
worksheet and the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Notify the appropriate clinical staff of critical values as per
laboratory policy.
1. REFERENCE VALUES
Normal reference range will be established based on manufacturer
guidance and in-house validation but must be reviewed periodically
for clinical relevance.
1. LIMITATIONS
• Refer to the CHEESE CHEDDAR IgG ELISA kit insert for detailed
limitations and cross-reactivity information.
• Ensure no air bubbles in wells during measurements.
1. METHOD VALIDATION AND QUALITY CONTROL
6.1 Internal QC:
• Perform weekly calibration checks.
• Record and track QC results in a logbook.
6.2 External QC:
• Participate in external proficiency testing programs quarterly.
1. REFERENCE
• Manufacturer’s CHEESE CHEDDAR IgG ELISA Kit insert.
• Laboratory internal QC logs and calibration records.
1. REVIEW AND DOCUMENTATION
• This SOP is subject to annual review or as necessary upon
introduction of new equipment, reagents, or protocols.
By following this SOP, laboratory personnel will ensure consistent,
accurate, and timely generation of CHEESE CHEDDAR IgG results
for patient diagnostics.
