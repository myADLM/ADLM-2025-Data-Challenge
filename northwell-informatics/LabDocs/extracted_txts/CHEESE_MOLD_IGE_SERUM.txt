Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase for Generating Results for CHEESE, MOLD,
IgE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
To provide detailed procedures for the analytical phase of testing
CHEESE, MOLD, IgE, and SERUM specimens and generating
accurate and reliable results.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing tests
according to the procedures defined in this SOP. All staff are required
to follow proper protocols to ensure the integrity and accuracy of test
results.
1. SPECIMEN
Preferred/Acceptable Specimens:
CHEESE: Samples taken from suspect areas should be stored in sterile containers; samples should arrive in the laboratory within 24 hours of collection.
MOLD: Swabs, air samples, or surface samples collected in designated sterile containers; samples should arrive in the laboratory within 24 hours of collection.
IgE: 2-5 mL of blood collected in serum-separator (SST) or red-top tubes; blood should be allowed to clot for 30 minutes and centrifuged within 1 hour to separate serum. Samples should be stored at 2-8°C if not immediately processed, and can be preserved frozen at -20°C if prolonged storage is necessary.
SERUM: 2-5 mL of blood collected in serum-separator (SST) or red-top tubes; blood should be allowed to clot for 30 minutes and centrifuged within 1 hour to separate serum. Samples should be stored at 2-8°C if not immediately processed. Samples can be stored frozen at -20°C for prolonged storage.
Unacceptable Specimens:
CHEESE: Samples arriving in the laboratory more than 24 hours after collection or in non-sterile containers.
MOLD: Specimens arriving in the laboratory more than 24 hours after collection or in non-sterile containers.
IgE: Blood samples with visible hemolysis or clotting that were not processed within required timeframes.
SERUM: Improperly clotted blood or samples that were not centrifuged within an hour of collection.
1. PROCEDURE
CHEESE Analysis:
1. Upon receiving the sample, log the date, time, and condition in the specimen tracking system.
2. Store at 2-8°C until analysis.
3. Homogenize the cheese sample while maintaining sterility.
4. Perform bacteriological and/or fungal tests using appropriate media and incubate according to specific protocols.
5. Document and interpret colony growth, perform further biochemical tests as necessary.
6. Report results following site-specific guidelines.
MOLD Analysis:
1. Upon receiving the sample, log the date, time, and condition in the specimen tracking system.
2. Store at 2-8°C until analysis.
3. For swabs, air, or surface samples, culture on selective media and incubate appropriately.
4. Assess colony morphology, pigmentation, and perform microscopic examination.
5. Use molecular techniques (e.g., PCR) if necessary for further identification.
6. Document findings and report results according to site-specific procedures.
IgE Analysis:
1. Upon receiving the sample, log the date, time, and condition in the specimen tracking system.
2. Store at 2-8°C until analysis.
3. Set up enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) specific for total IgE measurement.
4. Ensure all reagents are at room temperature before use.
5. Follow the kit manufacturer's instructions for sample preparation, reagent handling, and assay protocol.
6. Measure optical density and calculate IgE concentration using a standard curve.
7. Validate and document results, and report as per site-specific guidelines.
SERUM Analysis:
1. Upon receiving the sample, log the date, time, and condition in the specimen tracking system.
2. Store at 2-8°C until analysis.
3. Use specific analytical methods (e.g., ELISA, Chemiluminescent Immunoassay) for measuring target analytes in serum.
4. Ensure all reagents, equipment, and supplies are in working order before starting.
5. Follow the manufacturer's guidelines for assay preparation, reagent handling, and analysis.
6. Measure and calculate concentrations according to the standardized protocol.
7. Validate and document results, and report according to the site-specific guidelines.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
Internal quality control material for each test should be
analyzed according to a set schedule to monitor accuracy.
Document all results and corrective actions if QC fails.
2. REPORTING RESULTS
Refer to site-specific procedures for reviewing and verifying
results. Ensure all data have been accurately entered into the
Laboratory Information System (LIS).
3. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to specific assay kit inserts or manufacturers' guidelines
for limitations in the testing methods for CHEESE, MOLD, IgE,
and SERUM.
