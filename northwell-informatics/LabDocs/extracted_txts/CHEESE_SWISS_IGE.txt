Analytical Phase Protocol for CHEESE SWISS IGE
1. PURPOSE To define the standard operating procedure for the
accurate and consistent measurement of CHEESE SWISS
Immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels. This test is essential for
diagnosing potential allergies to Swiss cheese.
2. RESPONSIBILITY It is the responsibility of the designated
medical laboratory scientist to perform and document the
CHEESE SWISS IgE test according to this protocol. Any
deviations or issues must be reported to the supervisor
immediately.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred Sample Type: Serum or plasma (Lithium heparin,
EDTA, or citrate)
• Volume Required: Minimum 1 mL serum or plasma
• Stability: Specimens should be refrigerated at 2-8°C and analyzed
within 7 days of collection. For longer storage, freeze at -20°C or
lower.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Equipment: Automated Immunoassay Analyzer (e.g.,
ImmunoCAP, Immulite)
• Reagents: CHEESE SWISS IgE reagent kit, controls, calibrator
• Supplies: Pipettes, microcentrifuge tubes, disposable gloves, lab
coats, and appropriate waste containers
1. PROCEDURE A) Preparation
◦ Ensure all reagents and sample materials are at room
temperature (15-25°C) prior to use.
◦ Set up the Immunoassay Analyzer as per manufacturer’s
guidelines.
◦ Label all samples, controls, and calibrators appropriately.
B) Calibration
• Perform a 2-point or 3-point calibration using the provided
CHEESE SWISS IgE calibrators according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
• Ensure the calibration curve is valid and within acceptable limits.
C) Quality Control
• Run CHEESE SWISS IgE controls (low, medium, and high) in
accordance with laboratory QC procedures.
• Verify that control results fall within acceptable ranges before
proceeding. If controls are out of range, troubleshoot and rerun
controls.
D) Sample Analysis
• Prepare patient samples by centrifuging collected blood
specimens at 1500x g for 10 minutes to separate serum/plasma.
• Aliquot the required volume into suitable microcentrifuge tubes.
• Load samples, calibrators, and controls onto the analyzer as per
the system instructions.
• Start the run following the specific assay protocol of the analyzer.
E) Troubleshooting
• If an error code or unexpected result is generated, refer to the
analyzer’s troubleshooting guide.
• Repeat the testing for confirmation and, if necessary, consult with
the supervisor.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ After completion of the run, review and verify all results
before reporting.
◦ Results should be reported in kU/L (kilo Units per Liter).
◦ Reference ranges: <0.35 kU/L (negative), 0.35-0.7 kU/L (low
positive), 0.7-3.5 kU/L (moderate positive), 3.5-17.5 kU/L
(high positive), >17.5 kU/L (very high positive).
◦ Document all results in the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
2. CRITICAL VALUES
◦ Not typically reported for IgE levels; however, results
exceeding 17.5 kU/L should be carefully reviewed and may
require immediate consultation with the attending physician.
3. SAFETY AND WASTE DISPOSAL
◦ Follow standard laboratory safety protocols, including the
use of PPE (Personal Protective Equipment).
◦ Dispose of all biological and chemical wastes in accordance
with the laboratory’s waste disposal policy.

◦ Manufacturer’s instructions for the Immunoassay Analyzer.
◦ CHEESE SWISS IgE reagent kit insert.
◦ Laboratory’s Quality Control Manual.
5. REVIEW AND DOCUMENTATION
• This SOP must be reviewed annually and updated as necessary.
• All staff must be trained on this protocol and demonstrate
competency before performing the CHEESE SWISS IgE test.
This protocol ensures consistent and accurate measurement of
CHEESE SWISS IgE, allowing for reliable diagnosis and
management of cheese allergen-induced conditions.
