Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for CHERRY IgE, Serum
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to ensure standardized and
accurate measurement of CHERRY IgE levels in serum samples,
ensuring that all analytic processes follow Clinical Laboratory
Improvement Amendments (CLIA) guidelines for generating reliable
and accurate results.
Responsibility: It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory
personnel to perform the analytical procedures as outlined, ensure
accuracy and reliability of the test results, and document all required
information.
1. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all CHERRY IgE serum tests performed in the
laboratory. It is intended for use by trained laboratory personnel
conducting the test analysis.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred/Acceptable: 5 mL of serum obtained from a venous
blood sample using a serum separator tube (SST) or a red-top
tube.
• Unacceptable: Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric specimens.
Specimens that have been stored for longer than 7 days post-
collection or are improperly labeled.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• CHERRY IgE assay kit
• Calibrators and controls as specified by the manufacturer
• Micropipettes and appropriate pipette tips
• Tubes for sample dilution (if applicable)
• Vortex mixer
• Centrifuge (for serum separation)
• Incubator (if specified by assay manufacturer)
• Automated immunoassay analyzer or ELISA reader compatible
with CHERRY IgE assay
• Personal protective equipment (PPE) including gloves, lab coat,
and safety goggles
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run internal quality controls (QC) with each batch of samples.
• Use controls at two levels: Low and High.
• Calibrate the instrument as per manufacturer's instructions.
• If QC results are out of the acceptable range, troubleshoot
according to the manufacturer’s guidelines and do not report
patient results until QC issues are resolved.
1. PROCEDURE
Sample Preparation:
• Allow serum specimens to clot completely before centrifugation.
• Centrifuge specimens at 1500xg for 10 minutes.
• Carefully aliquot the clear serum into labeled secondary tubes,
avoiding the cellular components.
CHERRY IgE Assay:
• Step 1: Ensure all reagents and samples are at room temperature
before starting the assay.
• Step 2: Prepare the reagents according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
• Step 3: Pipette the required volume of calibrators, controls, and
patient samples into the designated wells or assay tubes.
◦ For example: 100 µL of sample per well.
• Step 4: Add the enzyme conjugate to each well.
• Step 5: Incubate the plate or tubes for the specified incubation
time at the recommended temperature.
◦ For example: Incubate for 30 minutes at 37°C.
• Step 6: After incubation, wash the wells/tubes with the wash
solution provided in the kit to remove unbound components.
• Step 7: Add the substrate solution to each well, incubate for the
specified time.
◦ For example: Incubate for 15 minutes at room temperature in
the dark.
• Step 8: Add the stop solution to terminate the enzymatic reaction.
• Step 9: Read the absorbance of each well at the specified
wavelength using the microplate reader (e.g., 450 nm).
Analyzer Specific Instructions:
• For automated analyzers, upload the appropriate assay protocol
and follow manufacturer-specific instructions for running the
CHERRY IgE assay.
1. CALCULATION AND RESULT INTERPRETATION
• Generate the standard curve using the calibrators’ absorbance
values and their corresponding CHERRY IgE concentrations.
• Calculate the CHERRY IgE concentration in patient samples
using the standard curve.
• Ensure the results fall within the assay's measurable range. If
results are outside the high control limit, dilute the sample and
rerun the test.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Review and verify results through the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
• Document any discrepancies or unusual results and recheck with
retesting as necessary.
• Report results within normal and critical values ranges as
determined by the reference intervals, adding notes for any
results outside the analytical measurement range.
Reference Intervals:
• CHERRY IgE Levels: Negative (<0.35 IU/mL), Borderline (0.35 -
0.7 IU/mL), Positive (> 0.7 IU/mL)
1. SAMPLE INTEGRITY ISSUES
• Any queries regarding sample integrity such as hemolysis,
lipemia, or clots should be noted.
• If the sample integrity is compromised, contact the ordering
physician for a redraw and indicate the possible inaccuracies
related to compromised samples.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to the manufacturer’s insert for method limitations.
• Cross-reactions with other substances in the sample or assay
component interferences should be considered.
1. REFERENCE
• CHERRY IgE Assay Kit Package Insert and Manufacturer’s
Instructions
1. DOCUMENTATION
• Maintain records of performed tests, QC results, calibrations,
maintenance logs, and any corrective actions taken.
• Ensure both electronic and hard copies of records are retained as
per laboratory policy.
1. REVIEW AND APPROVAL
• This SOP should be reviewed annually or as required by
regulatory guidelines.
By following these processes, the laboratory ensures reliable and
valid reporting of CHERRY IgE, Serum results, thus maintaining high
standards for patient care and safety in accordance with CLIA
guidelines.
