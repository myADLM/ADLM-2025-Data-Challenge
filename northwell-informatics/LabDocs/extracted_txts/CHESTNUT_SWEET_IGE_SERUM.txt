Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase for Generating Results for CHESTNUT,
SWEET, IGE, SERUM
Effective Date: [Insert Date] Review Date: [Insert Date] Version:
1.0
1. PURPOSE: To provide a standardized protocol for the analytical
phase of generating results for Chestnut, Sweet, IgE, Serum. This
includes the procedures for the preparation, analysis, quality control,
and reporting of results.
2. SCOPE: This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel
performing the analysis of Chestnut, Sweet, IgE in Serum within the
laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITIES:
• Laboratory Technologists: Perform the analysis as outlined in this
SOP.
• Laboratory Supervisors: Ensure compliance with the SOP,
oversee quality control, and handle any issues that arise during
the analytical process.
• Quality Assurance Team: Validate and review the processes and
results.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS:
• Preferred Specimen: Serum
• Collection: Blood collected in a serum separator tube (SST). Allow
the blood to clot at room temperature for at least 30 minutes,
followed by centrifugation to separate serum.
• Stability: Serum samples should be stored at 2-8°C and analyzed
within 7 days. For long-term storage, freeze at -20°C or lower.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES:
• Immunoassay Analyzer (e.g., ImmunoCAP/Phadia)
• Reagents specific to Chestnut, Sweet, IgE assays
• Calibrators and controls
• Pipettes and tips
• SST tubes
• Centrifuge
• Refrigerator and Freezer for sample storage
6. PROCEDURE:
A. Sample Preparation:
1. Thaw frozen serum samples at room temperature.
2. Mix samples gently by inversion.
3. Aliquot an appropriate volume of serum for testing (according to
manufacturer's instructions).
B. Instrument Preparation:
1. Ensure the immunoassay analyzer is clean, calibrated, and
functional.
2. Confirm the availability of required reagents, calibrators, and
controls.
3. Load the reagents, calibrators, controls, and serum samples
onto the analyzer as per the manufacturer's guidelines.
C. Calibration and Quality Control:
1. Perform calibration according to the manufacturer's instructions.
2. Run quality control samples at multiple levels (low, medium,
high) with each assay batch.
3. Record QC results in the Quality Control Log.
4. Ensure QC results are within the acceptable range. If QC fails,
troubleshoot the issue, recalibrate, and rerun controls before
proceeding with patient samples.
D. Sample Analysis:
1. Load the prepared samples onto the immunoassay analyzer.
2. Select the appropriate assay for Chestnut, Sweet, IgE testing.
3. Start the analysis and monitor the process to ensure proper
operation.
4. Once analysis is complete, review results for any flags or
errors.
7. DATA REVIEW AND REPORTING:
1. Verify and validate the results on the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
2. Ensure that results are correctly matched to patient identifiers.
3. Review results for any abnormalities or out-of-range values.
4. Enter results into the LIS, and where required, apply
interpretive comments.
5. Attach quality control data to the batch results for review by the
supervisor.
8. RESULT INTERPRETATION:
• Reference ranges for IgE:
◦ Chestnut and Sweet allergen-specific IgE: Negative (<0.10 kU/
L), Low (0.10-0.35 kU/L), Moderate (0.36-0.70 kU/L), High
(0.71-3.50 kU/L), Very High (>3.51 kU/L)
◦ Total IgE: 0 - 100 kU/L (range may vary based on age and
laboratory standards).
9. QUALITY CONTROL:
• Perform QC checks with every new reagent lot, new calibration
curve, and at the start of each shift.
• Utilize both commercial QC materials and in-house pooled serum
controls.
• Document any deviations, corrective actions, and repeat analyses
if required.
10. REFERENCES:
• Manufacturer's instructions for Immunoassay Analyzer and IgE
reagents.
• Laboratory Safety and Compliance Manuals.
• National and International Guidelines for Allergy Testing.
By adhering to this SOP, laboratory personnel can ensure the
accurate, reproducible, and timely generation of results for
CHESTNUT, SWEET, IGE SERUM tests. Consistent and proper
documentation is crucial for maintaining high standards and ensuring
quality patient care.
