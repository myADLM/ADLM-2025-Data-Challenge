STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP)
1. PURPOSE
This procedure outlines the steps required to analyze and generate
results for Chestnut Tree, IgE (Immunoglobulin E), Serum using the
ImmunoCAP method. This process ensures accurate and reliable
results for clinical decision-making.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the laboratory technologist to ensure that
procedures are performed according to the protocol. The laboratory
supervisor will review and approve the procedure, providing guidance
and troubleshooting support as needed.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND MATERIALS
• ImmunoCAP 250 or equivalent analyzer
• Refrigerated centrifuge
• Serum separation tubes (SST)
• Chestnut Tree, IgE ImmunoCAP reagent/test kits
• Calibrators and controls specific to Chestnut Tree, IgE
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Incubator (if necessary)
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Serum samples collected in SSTs.
• Specimens must be allowed to clot for 30 minutes and then
centrifuged at 1500-2000 x g for 10 minutes to obtain clear serum.
• Specimens must be free of hemolysis, lipemia, or contamination.
• Store specimens at 2-8°C if assayed within 7 days, or frozen at
-20°C or below for longer storage.
5. PROCEDURE
5.1 Sample Preparation:
1. Ensure all reagents and samples are at room temperature
before beginning the analysis.
2. Verify that the sample meets acceptance criteria (proper
labeling, collection date, and no visible signs of hemolysis,
lipemia, or contamination).
3. Mix the serum sample gently by inversion before loading onto
the analyzer.
5.2 Calibration:
1. Run the calibrators according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
2. Document calibration results and ensure they fall within the
acceptable range.
3. If calibration is out of range, perform necessary troubleshooting
steps as indicated by the instrument manual.
5.3 Quality Control:
1. Run control samples (normal and elevated IgE levels) prior to
patient testing to ensure accuracy and precision.
2. Document control results and take appropriate corrective
actions if controls fall outside the manufacturer's specified
ranges.
3. Do not proceed with patient sample analysis until control results
are within acceptable limits.
5.4 Patient Sample Analysis:
1. Load patient samples into the analyzer as per the
manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Select the Chestnut Tree, IgE assay on the analyzer.
3. Start the analysis program.
4. Monitor the run for any system alerts or errors.
5.5 Results Validation and Documentation:
1. Upon completion of analysis, review results for each patient
sample.
2. Validate results by checking against controls and ensuring no
error codes are present.
3. Document results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
and ensure proper linkage to the patient record.
4. Print a copy of the results report for record-keeping as per
laboratory protocol.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
• Transmit validated results automatically to the LIS.
• Ensure that critical results are communicated to the relevant
healthcare provider immediately, following the laboratory's
standard critical result protocol.
7. TARGET REFERENCE INTERVALS FOR CHESTNUT TREE, IGE
• Reference intervals will be as specified by the manufacturer’s kit
insert or established laboratory-specific intervals based on
population studies.
• Serum IgE levels specific to Chestnut Tree allergen: -<0.35 kU/L:
Negative -0.35-0.70 kU/L: Low -0.70-3.50 kU/L: Moderate
-3.50-17.50 kU/L: High ->17.50 kU/L: Very High
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to the ImmunoCAP 250 package insert or equivalent
analyzer documentation for specific limitations related to the
detection of Chestnut Tree, IgE.
• Potential interferences may include high levels of heterophile
antibodies or grossly hemolyzed/lipemic samples.
9. QUALITY CONTROL
• Ensure routine bi-weekly and monthly internal quality control
checks as previously described.
