Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analysis of Chicken
Droppings, IgE, Serum
1. PURPOSE
This procedure outlines the steps necessary to accurately measure
the IgE levels specific to chicken droppings in serum samples. Such
testing is crucial for diagnosing allergies related to chicken droppings
in patients.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of laboratory personnel to ensure accurate
analysis following this SOP, maintain equipment, document results,
perform quality control, and address any discrepancies.
3. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
• Automated Immunoassay Analyzer (e.g., ImmunoCAP,
IMMULITE)
• Calibrators and Controls appropriate for IgE measurement
• Serum samples
• Micropipettes and tips
• Eppendorf tubes
• Incubator
• Vortex mixer
• Centrifuge
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
• Reagents: buffers, diluents, and allergen-specific conjugates
(Chicken Droppings)
• Deionized water
4. PROCEDURE
4.1 Sample Preparation and Handling
1. Receive and Accession Sample:
◦ Samples (serum) should be logged in and assigned unique
identifiers upon receipt.
2. Acceptance Criteria:
◦ Inspect serum samples for any signs of hemolysis or other
contamination.
◦ Verify the volume and integrity of the sample.
3. Preparation:
◦ Allow refrigerated samples to come to room temperature
and gently mix using a vortex mixer.
4.2 Calibration and Quality Control:
1. Calibrators:
◦ Prepare calibrators as described in the manufacturer's
instructions.
◦ Run a fresh calibration curve to ensure accurate
quantification.
2. Controls:
◦ Run positive and negative quality controls with each batch
of patient samples.
◦ Record control results to verify they fall within the accepted
range.
4.3 Analysis:
1. Instrument Preparation:
◦ Turn on the immunoassay analyzer and perform daily
maintenance as per the manufacturer's guidelines.
◦ Ensure the system is free of any previous residues and all
parts are functioning properly.
2. Load Reagents:
◦ Load the appropriate allergen-specific conjugates (Chicken
Droppings) and other reagents onto the analyzer.
3. Sample Loading:
◦ Pipette required volumes of serum samples, calibrators, and
controls into their respective assay tubes or wells according
to the instrument's protocol.
◦ Load samples into the analyzer.
4. Run Assay:
◦ Initiate the assay run according to the immunoassay
analyzer's standard operational procedure.
◦ Ensure all reactions are complete, and the analyzer has
processed all samples according to the manufacturer's
timing and mixing protocols.
4.4 Result Generation and Interpretation:
1. Result Examination:
◦ Review results on the instrument’s display.
◦ Verify that all control results are within the acceptable range.
◦ If controls are out of range, troubleshoot, recalibrate, and
repeat the assay.
2. Result Recording:
◦ Document the raw data and interpret the results to
determine if the IgE levels specific to chicken droppings fall
within the normal or allergenic range.
3. Reporting:
◦ Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
◦ Flag any critical or abnormal results for review by the clinical
pathologist.
5. QUALITY CONTROL AND TROUBLESHOOTING
1. Control Failure:
◦ If any control fails, document the occurrence, investigate
potential causes, recalibrate the instrument if needed, and
repeat the analysis.
2. Instrument Errors:
◦ If instrument errors occur, refer to the manufacturer's
troubleshooting guide, perform necessary maintenance or
contact technical support.
6. SAFETY AND HANDLING
1. Safety Measures:
◦ Always wear appropriate PPE, including lab coat, gloves,
and eye protection.
◦ Handle all biological samples as potentially infectious
material.
2. Waste Disposal:
◦ Dispose of all biological and sharp waste in accordance with
biomedical waste regulations.
