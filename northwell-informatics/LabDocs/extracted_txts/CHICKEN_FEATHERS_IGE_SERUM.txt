Standard Operating Protocol for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Chicken Feathers, IgE, Serum
1. PURPOSE To outline the procedure for the determination of IgE
antibodies specific to chicken feathers in serum. The protocol
ensures consistent and reliable results, maintaining compliance with
CLIA regulations.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
• Qualified laboratory technologists are responsible for following
this protocol to analyze serum samples for chicken feather-
specific IgE.
• Laboratory supervisors are responsible for ensuring that testing is
completed in compliance with this protocol and that all quality
controls are observed.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND HANDLING
• Preferred Specimen: Serum
• Collection: Blood must be collected in a red-topped (serum)
tube. Allow the blood to clot for 30 minutes and then centrifuge for
10 minutes at 1500 x g. Transfer the serum into a labeled aliquot
tube.
• Stability: Serum specimens are stable for up to 7 days when
stored at 2-8°C and for up to 30 days at -20°C or below.
• Unacceptable Specimen Conditions:
◦ Hemolyzed specimens
◦ Lipemic specimens
◦ Specimens stored at room temperature for more than 24 hours
◦ Specimens without proper identification
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Immunoassay analyzer (e.g., Phadia 250, ImmunoCAP)
• Chicken Feathers (F76) IgE ImmunoCAP
• Appropriate control reagents (High, Low, Negative Control serum)
• Micropipettes and tips
• Serum sample aliquot tubes
• Centrifuge
5. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform quality control with each run of patient samples using
high, low, and negative control sera.
• Verify that control values are within the acceptable range before
proceeding with patient sample analysis. If controls fail,
troubleshoot according to the manufacturer's instructions and
document all corrective actions.
6. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Ensure all reagents, controls, and samples are at room
temperature before starting the assay.
2. Calibrate the immunoassay analyzer as per the manufacturer's
instructions or verify that a valid calibration is in place.
Loading Samples:
1. Load the serum samples and control sera onto the sample rack.
2. Assign appropriate identification numbers to all samples in the
Laboratory Information System (LIS).
Running the Assay:
1. Load the Chicken Feathers (F76) IgE ImmunoCAP and
necessary reagents onto the immunoassay analyzer.
2. Initiate the assay run according to the manufacturer's manual.
Result Generation:
1. Once the assay is complete, review the results for controls first
to ensure validity.
2. Validate patient sample results in the LIS. Review and interpret
results as per the manufacturer's guidelines.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
• Electronically transmit validated results to the Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
• Ensure results for chicken feather-specific IgE are reported in kilo
International Units per liter (kU/L).
• Results interpretation:
◦ <0.10 kU/L – None detected
◦ 0.10 - 0.34 kU/L – Low level of specific IgE
◦ 0.35 - 0.69 kU/L – Moderate level of specific IgE
◦ 0.70 kU/L – High level of specific IgE
8. SAMPLE INTEGRITY
• Should sample integrity be in question due to visible hemolysis or
lipemia, flag the sample and seek supervisor guidance. Centrifuge
a small aliquot if necessary to confirm sample integrity.
9. CRITICAL RESULTS
• According to laboratory policy, report any critical findings
immediately to the requesting physician or responsible healthcare
provider. Document all communication clearly in the LIS.
10. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Cross-reactions with other avian proteins may occur and need to
be considered when interpreting results.
• Variability in patient conditions and specimen quality may
influence results.
