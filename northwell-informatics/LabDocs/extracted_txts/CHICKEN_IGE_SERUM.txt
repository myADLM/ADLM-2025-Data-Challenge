Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for CHICKEN, IGE, SERUM
Assay
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the procedure for performing and generating
results for CHICKEN, IGE, SERUM assay in order to ensure accurate
and reliable test results for clinical diagnosis and patient
management.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of trained laboratory technologists to perform
the CHICKEN, IGE, SERUM assay as per this procedure.
Lab supervisors are responsible for reviewing the results to ensure
quality control and to oversee any corrective actions required.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Type: Serum
• Volume: Minimum 0.5 mL of serum
• Collection: Collect blood in a red-top or SST (serum-separating
tube). Allow blood to clot at room temperature, then centrifuge to
separate serum.
• Storage: Serum samples must be stored at 2-8°C if not
immediately processed. Long-term storage at -20°C is
acceptable.
• Unacceptable Specimens: Samples showing significant
hemolysis, lipemia, or contamination, and those improperly
labeled or lacking collection date.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• Analyzer: [Name of ELISA or ImmunoCAP instrument]
• Reagents: CHICKEN, IGE-specific assay kits
• Equipment: Centrifuge, pipettes, incubator, refrigeration units.
• Supplies: SST tubes, serum aliquot tubes, gloves, single-use
pipette tips, timer.
5. PROCEDURE
A) Sample Preparation
1. Verify the sample label and requisition to ensure they match
and the specimen is acceptable.
2. Centrifuge the blood samples at 3,000 rpm for 10 minutes to
obtain serum. Transfer the serum to labeled serum aliquot
tubes.
B) ELISA Procedure
1. Reagent Preparation:
◦ Prepare all reagents as per the manufacturer's protocol
included in the assay kit.
◦ Ensure all reagents are at room temperature prior to
beginning the assay.
2. Assay Protocol:
◦ Add the standard, controls, and serum samples to the
designated wells of the assay plate.
◦ Follow manufacturer's instructions for reagent addition,
incubation time, and temperature.
◦ Wash the plate as per protocol after each incubation step.
◦ Add substrate solution and incubate; protect from light.
◦ Add stop solution and measure absorbance at the specified
wavelength using the spectrophotometer or plate reader.
3. Result Calculation:
◦ Calculate the CHICKEN, IGE concentration in the serum
samples using the standard curve generated from known
standards.
C) Quality Control
Perform internal quality control using control samples provided in the
kit. Control values must fall within the specified range.
Document all QC activities in the Quality Control log as per laboratory
guidelines.
D) Troubleshooting
1. If control values are out of range:
◦ Check reagent preparation and storage conditions.
◦ Check instrument calibration and performance.
◦ Repeat assay with fresh controls and reagents.
◦ Consult manufacturer’s guidelines for specific
troubleshooting measures.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results are automatically captured by the LIS after assay
completion.
• Review results as per laboratory protocols.
• Reference Intervals for CHICKEN, IGE will be provided in the LIS.
Confirm the reference range for each batch/run.
• Any values outside the reference interval must be flagged and
communicated to the healthcare provider.
7. DOCUMENTING AND VALIDATION
Ensure all data entry is accurate and complete in both the laboratory
information system and patient records.
8. MAINTENANCE AND CALIBRATION
Follow manufacturer's instructions for routine maintenance and
calibration of equipment. Document all activities for auditing
purposes.
