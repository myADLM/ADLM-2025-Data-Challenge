1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is to
provide a detailed protocol for the analysis and generation of results
for Chicken Immunoglobulin G (IgG) in serum samples using an
Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA).
2. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing the
analysis and generating results for Chicken IgG using the ELISA
method as outlined in this procedure. All personnel involved in the
process must ensure that the procedure is followed accurately and
corrective actions are taken if deviations occur.
3. PRINCIPLE AND/OR PURPOSE
The ELISA method for Chicken IgG quantification involves the
specific binding of Chicken IgG in serum samples to pre-coated
antibodies on a microplate, followed by detection using enzyme-
conjugated secondary antibodies and a colorimetric substrate
reaction.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/acceptable:
• Serum samples should be collected in sterile, anticoagulant-free
vacutainers.
• Samples should be centrifuged at 1500g for 10 minutes to
separate the serum, which must be transferred to a labeled
aliquot tube and stored at 2-8°C if analyzed within 48 hours, or
frozen at -20°C for longer storage. Avoid repeated freeze-thaw
cycles.
Unacceptable:
• Samples collected in anticoagulant-containing tubes.
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or contaminated specimens.
• Samples that have been improperly stored or exceed the stability
period.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• ELISA Microplate Reader
• Incubator set to 37°C
• Plate shaker
• Micropipettes and tips (10 μL, 100 μL, 1000 μL)
• Multichannel pipette and tips
• ELISA microplate (96 wells) pre-coated with anti-Chicken IgG
antibodies
• Chicken IgG Standards
• Sample Diluent
• Wash Buffer (PBS with 0.05% Tween-20)
• Enzyme-conjugated Anti-Chicken IgG Antibody (typically HRP-
conjugated)
• TMB Substrate Solution
• Stop Solution (1M H2SO4)
6. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation
1. Bring all reagents and samples to room temperature before
starting the assay.
2. Prepare working solutions of wash buffer, diluents, and
enzyme-conjugated antibodies as per manufacturer’s
instructions.
3. Reconstitute Chicken IgG standards using the provided
diluent according to the manufacturer's recommendations.
B. Sample Dilution
1. Dilute serum samples in the sample diluent, typically 1:100
to 1:1000, depending on expected IgG concentration.
Ensure all samples are diluted uniformly.
C. Plate Setup
1. Add 100 μL of standards, controls, and diluted samples to
the designated wells of the pre-coated microplate.
2. Seal the plate with adhesive film and incubate at 37°C for 1
hour to allow binding.
D. Washing
1. Remove the adhesive film and wash the wells 3 times with
300 μL of wash buffer. Tap the plate on absorbent paper to
remove residual liquid.
E. Detection Antibody
1. Add 100 μL of enzyme-conjugated anti-Chicken IgG
antibody to each well.
2. Seal the plate with adhesive film and incubate at 37°C for
30 minutes.
F. Final Washing
1. Remove the adhesive film and wash the wells 3 times with
300 μL of wash buffer. Tap the plate on absorbent paper to
remove residual liquid.
G. Substrate Reaction
1. Add 100 μL of TMB substrate solution to each well.
2. Incubate in the dark at room temperature for 15-30
minutes, watching for the development of a blue color.
H. Stopping the Reaction
1. Add 50 μL of stop solution to each well, resulting in a color
change from blue to yellow.
I. Reading the Plate
1. Read the absorbance at 450 nm using a microplate reader
within 30 minutes of stopping the reaction.
7. CALCULATION OF RESULTS
1. Generate a standard curve by plotting the absorbance
readings of the standards against their known
concentrations.
2. Determine the Chicken IgG concentration of the samples
by interpolation from the standard curve using suitable
software or graphing methods.
3. Adjust for sample dilution by multiplying the interpolated
concentration by the dilution factor.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Include internal controls and external quality control
samples in each assay run.
2. If any control or standard falls outside the specified range,
investigate possible causes and repeat the assay if
necessary.
9. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Establish or refer to laboratory-specific reference ranges for
Chicken IgG concentrations based on validated data.
10. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Report results as concentration of Chicken IgG in the
sample (e.g., ng/mL or μg/mL).
2. Include any relevant comments or observations that may
affect the interpretation of results.
11. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Any limitations related to interferences, cross-reactivity, sensitivity,
and specificity should be detailed according to the ELISA kit
manufacturer's insert.
12. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions for the Chicken IgG ELISA kit used.
• Relevant literature on ELISA protocols and guidelines for
immunoglobulin quantification in avian species.
This procedure must be followed precisely, and any deviations must
be documented and communicated to a supervisor immediately.
This protocol is designed for the analytical phase of generating
results for Chicken IgG and should be reviewed and approved by the
laboratory management. Adjustments to the protocol should be made
based on specific laboratory needs and validated accordingly.
