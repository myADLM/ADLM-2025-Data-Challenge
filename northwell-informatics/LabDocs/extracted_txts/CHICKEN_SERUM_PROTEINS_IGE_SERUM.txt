Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase Protocol for Determination of Chicken Serum
Proteins and IgE (Serum)
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for the accurate and precise measurement
of chicken serum proteins and serum IgE levels to ensure reliable
and reproducible results in the laboratory.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing the
procedures as outlined in this protocol. The supervisor is responsible
for ensuring staff compliance with this SOP and addressing any
issues or discrepancies.
1. DEFINITION
Chicken serum proteins and IgE measurement involves the use of
analytical techniques such as nephelometry, turbidimetry, or enzyme-
linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to quantify the levels of
proteins and Immunoglobulin E in chicken serum.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STORAGE
Preferred Specimen: Serum collected from chicken blood
samples Acceptable Specimen: Serum separated from blood
samples within 2 hours of collection Unacceptable Specimen:
Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric serum samples Storage: Serum
samples should be stored at -20°C if not analyzed immediately.
For long-term storage, keep at -80°C.
2. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
ELISA kit for Chicken IgE Protein Assay Kit (BCA, Bradford,
etc.) Microplate Reader Centrifuge Micropipettes and tips
Vortex mixer Incubator Standard laboratory glassware
3. PROCEDURE
6.1 Preparation
a. Thaw serum samples at room temperature.
b. Vortex samples to ensure homogeneity.
c. Arrange all necessary reagents and equipment.
6.2 Total Serum Protein Measurement (BCA Assay)
a. Prepare the working reagent according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
b. Pipette 25 µL of each standard and sample into appropriate wells.
c. Add 200 µL of the working reagent to each well.
d. Incubate plate at 37°C for 30 minutes.
e. Measure absorbance at 562 nm using a microplate reader.
f. Plot the standard curve and calculate the concentration of proteins in the samples using linear regression analysis.
6.3 IgE Measurement (ELISA)
a. Dilute samples and standards as required by the ELISA kit.
b. Add 100 µL of diluted standards, controls, and samples to the designated wells.
c. Incubate the microplate at 37°C for 1 hour.
d. Wash wells with wash buffer three times.
e. Add 100 µL of enzyme-linked secondary antibody to each well.
f. Incubate the plate at 37°C for 30 minutes.
g. Wash wells with wash buffer three times again.
h. Add 100 µL of TMB substrate solution to each well.
i. Incubate the plate in the dark at room temperature for 20 minutes.
j. Add 50 µL of stop solution to each well.
k. Measure absorbance at 450 nm using a microplate reader within 10 minutes.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
a. Run standard controls with each assay to ensure accuracy
and precision. b. Include negative controls to check for non-
specific binding. c. Record any deviations or abnormalities in
control results and take corrective actions as necessary.
2. DATA ANALYSIS
a. Use the standard curves generated from the assays to
determine the concentrations of serum proteins and IgE. b.
Validate results by ensuring they fall within acceptable ranges
of control samples. c. Re-calibrate equipment if discrepancies
are noted.
3. REPORTING RESULTS
a. Transmit results to the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
for review. b. Technologists must verify and confirm results
before final reporting. c. Document any anomalies or critical
results and notify the ordering clinician appropriately.

5. METHOD LIMITATIONS
a. Ensure adherence to proper sample handling and storage to
avoid degradation of serum proteins and IgE. b. Hemolyzed,
lipemic, or icteric samples may interfere with accurate
measurement.
By adhering to this protocol, laboratory personnel will ensure the
accurate and reliable analysis of chicken serum proteins and serum
IgE, contributing to the overall quality and integrity of the laboratory's
output.
