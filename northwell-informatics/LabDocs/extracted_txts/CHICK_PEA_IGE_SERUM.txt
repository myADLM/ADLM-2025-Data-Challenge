Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Analytical Phase for
Generating Results for Chick Pea, IgE, Serum
1. Purpose
To outline the analytical procedures for the determination of chick
pea-specific Immunoglobulin E (IgE) in serum samples. This assay
quantifies the level of IgE antibodies specific to chick pea allergens in
the patient's serum, aiding in the diagnosis of allergic reactions.
Responsibility:
• Trained laboratory technologists are responsible for performing
the analysis following this SOP.
• Supervisors oversee the adherence to this SOP and address any
deviations or issues.
1. Specimen Requirements and Stability
• Preferred Specimen:
◦ Serum collected in a red or gold (serum separator) top tube.
◦ After collection, allow the blood to clot at room temperature for
30-60 minutes.
◦ Centrifuge at 1500-2000 x g for 10 minutes to separate the
serum.
◦ Transfer serum to a labeled secondary tube if not using a
serum separator tube.
• Specimen Storage:
◦ Serum should be analyzed as soon as possible.
◦ If analysis is delayed, store serum at 2-8°C for up to 7 days.
◦ For long-term storage, serum can be frozen at -20°C or lower
for up to 3 months.
• Unacceptable Specimens:
◦ Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
◦ Specimens with visible particulate matter.
◦ Samples collected in EDTA, heparin, or citrate tubes.
1. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies
• Immunoassay analyzer (e.g., Phadia ImmunoCAP)
• Specific reagents for chick pea-specific IgE assay
• Calibrators and controls for the immunoassay
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Centrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Personal protective equipment (PPE) including lab coat, gloves,
and safety goggles
1. Procedure
2. Preparation:
◦ Ensure the immunoassay analyzer is calibrated and
maintenance procedures are up-to-date.
◦ Prepare reagents and controls according to manufacturer's
instructions.
◦ Allow reagents, calibrators, and controls to reach room
temperature before use.
3. Sample Preparation:
◦ Thaw frozen serum samples at room temperature and mix
gently by inversion or vortexing.
◦ Centrifuge at 1500-2000 x g for 10 minutes if visible
particulates are present.
4. Assay Procedure:
◦ Load reagents, calibrators, controls, and patient samples
into the immunoassay analyzer according to the
manufacturer's protocol.
◦ Program the analyzer with the appropriate assay
parameters for chick pea-specific IgE.
◦ Start the analysis. The analyzer will automatically process
the samples and perform the necessary incubations, wash
steps, and detections.
5. Quality Control:
◦ Run quality control samples with each batch of patient
samples.
◦ Refer to the manufacturer's insert for acceptable ranges for
quality control materials.
◦ Document all quality control results in the appropriate log.
6. Interpretation of Results:
◦ Analyze the results generated by the immunoassay
analyzer.
◦ The results will be reported in kUA/L (kilounits of allergen-
specific IgE per liter of serum).
◦ Compare patient results to reference ranges provided by the
assay manufacturer.
◦ All results should be reviewed and verified by a technologist
before reporting.
7. Troubleshooting and Corrective Actions:
◦ If quality control results are outside acceptable limits,
troubleshoot based on the analyzer’s error codes and
manufacturer's guidelines.
◦ Re-run the assay if necessary.
◦ Document any issues and corrective actions taken.
8. Reporting Results
• Enter patient results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
for review by the technologist.
• Verify results and ensure all quality control criteria are met.
• Release results to the patient's medical record following
laboratory protocols.
1. Reference Intervals
• Refer to the specific assay insert for reference intervals and
interpretative guidelines for chick pea-specific IgE.
1. Method Limitations
• High total IgE levels may interfere with specific IgE testing.
• The presence of heterophilic antibodies in the patient sample may
cause interference and produce erroneous results.
• Refer to the manufacturer's insert for additional limitations.
