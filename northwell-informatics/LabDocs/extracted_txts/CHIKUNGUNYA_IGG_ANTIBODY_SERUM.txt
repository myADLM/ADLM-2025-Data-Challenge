Standard Operating Procedure for Analytical Phase of Generating
Results for CHIKUNGUNYA IGG, ANTIBODY, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the analytical procedures for the detection of IgG
antibodies to Chikungunya Virus in human serum samples. These
antibodies indicate a past infection or exposure to the Chikungunya
Virus, and the results are used to aid in diagnosing Chikungunya
virus infection.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory technologists are responsible for
performing the assay and documenting the results.
• Supervisors are responsible for overseeing the accuracy and
reliability of the testing process and ensuring all procedures are
followed according to this SOP.
1. SPECIMEN
Preferred/Acceptable Specimen:
• Serum from a patient’s blood sample collected in a serum
separator tube (SST) or a plain red-top tube.
• The sample must be separated by centrifugation within 2 hours of
collection. The serum must then be stored at 2-8°C and tested
within five days, or stored at -20°C or colder for longer storage.
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric specimens.
• Specimens collected in anticoagulant tubes (e.g., EDTA, heparin).
• Specimens stored at 2-8°C for more than five days without
freezing.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• ELISA plate reader capable of measuring absorbance at 450 nm.
• ELISA kits for Chikungunya IgG (store reagents as per the
manufacturer's instructions).
• Calibrated single & multi-channel pipettes and tips.
• Microplate washing system or manual washing supplies.
• Incubator set to 37°C.
• Timer.
• Deionized or distilled water.
• Plate seals.
• Laboratory notebook or electronic system for recording data.
1. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Bring all reagents and serum specimens to room temperature
(20-25°C) before starting the assay.
2. Label the microplate strips to be used on the ELISA plate tray.
3. Prepare the wash buffer as instructed in the kit insert.
4. Prepare the required number of sample dilutions, calibrators,
controls, and reagents as per the kit insert.
Assay Procedure:
1. Add 100 µL of each diluted serum sample, control, and
calibrator to the designated wells of the ELISA plate.
2. Cover the plate with a plate sealer and incubate at 37°C for the
specified time (typically 60 minutes).
3. Wash the plate 5 times with 300 µL/well of wash buffer. After
the final wash, invert the plate and firmly tap it on clean
absorbent paper to remove any remaining liquid.
4. Add 100 µL of the enzyme conjugate to each well.
5. Cover the plate with a plate sealer and incubate at 37°C for a
specified time (typically 60 minutes).
6. Wash the plate 5 times as previously described.
7. Add 100 µL of TMB substrate solution to each well.
8. Incubate the plate at room temperature (20-25°C) in the dark
for the specified time (typically 10-15 minutes).
9. Add 100 µL of stop solution to each well to terminate the
reaction.
10. Read the absorbance of each well at 450 nm using an ELISA
plate reader within 30 minutes.
11. CALCULATIONS AND INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
12. Calculate the mean absorbance value for each control,
calibrator, and sample.
13. Determine the cutoff value based on the kit insert instructions.
14. Compare the sample absorbance values against the cutoff
value to interpret as follows:
◦ Positive: Absorbance value is greater than or equal to the
cutoff value.
◦ Negative: Absorbance value is less than the cutoff value.
15. Record all results in the laboratory information system.
16. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run external and internal quality controls with each assay to
ensure the accuracy and reliability of the results.
• If controls do not fall within predetermined ranges, do not report
results and repeat the assay.
• Document all QC results and maintain records as per laboratory
policy.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
2. Review and verify results before reporting.
3. Transmit verified results to the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
4. Report results as either positive or negative for Chikungunya
IgG antibodies.
5. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s insert for the Chikungunya IgG ELISA kit.
• WHO Guidelines for the collection of clinical specimens.
• Laboratory Quality Control Manuals.
1. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS
• Handle all specimens and reagents according to biosafety
guidelines, wearing appropriate personal protective equipment
(PPE).
• Dispose of all biohazardous materials and sharps in designated
containers following laboratory policies.
This SOP is effective as of October 2023 and is subject to revision
following updates in methodologies or regulations.
