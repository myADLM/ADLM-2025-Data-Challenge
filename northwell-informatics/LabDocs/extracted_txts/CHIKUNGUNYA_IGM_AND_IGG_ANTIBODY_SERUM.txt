Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for CHIKUNGUNYA IgM and
IgG Antibody Testing in Serum
1. PURPOSE
This SOP describes the procedures for the analytical phase of testing
for CHIKUNGUNYA IgM and IgG antibodies in serum specimens to
ensure accurate and reliable results.
1. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel performing
CHIKUNGUNYA IgM and IgG antibody testing in serum samples
using the designated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
or any other validated method available in the laboratory.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
Laboratory personnel trained in immunoassay techniques are
responsible for executing this procedure. Supervisors are responsible
for ensuring that the procedure is followed correctly and for reviewing
and validating the test results.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred: 1-2 mL serum collected in a serum separator tube
(SST).
• Specimen stability: Serum should be stored at 2-8°C if testing will
occur within 7 days. For longer storage, freeze at -20°C or lower.
• Unacceptable specimens: Grossly hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric
specimens, as well as specimens not labeled with collection date/
time and patient identification.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• ELISA reader capable of reading at appropriate wavelengths
(typically 450 nm and 620-650 nm for reference)
• Incubator set to 37°C
• Microplate washer
• Timer
• Micropipettes and pipette tips
• Distilled or deionized water
• CHIKUNGUNYA IgM and IgG ELISA kits, including:
◦ Calibrators
◦ Controls (positive and negative)
◦ ELISA microwell plates pre-coated with CHIKUNGUNYA
antigens
◦ Conjugate reagents
◦ Substrate solution
◦ Stop solution
◦ Wash buffer
• Laboratory logbook or LIMS for recording results
1. PROCEDURE
6.1. Preparation
• Allow all reagents and samples to reach room temperature
(18-25°C) before use.
• Label the ELISA microwell plate with patient identification,
calibrators, and controls.
6.2. Assay Procedure
1. Sample Addition
◦ Pipette the calibrators, controls, and patient serum samples
(typically 100 µL) into the designated wells.
2. Incubation
◦ Incubate the plate at 37°C for the specified time (usually 60
minutes) to allow antigen-antibody binding.
3. Washing
◦ Wash the wells with the prepared wash buffer, using a
microplate washer, according to the kit instructions (usually
4-5 times).
4. Conjugate Addition
◦ Add the enzyme-labeled secondary antibody (conjugate) to
each well.
◦ Incubate the plate at 37°C for another specified time
(typically 30 minutes).
5. Washing
◦ Perform a washing step as described above.
6. Substrate Addition
◦ Add the substrate solution to each well and incubate in the
dark at room temperature for 10-20 minutes until color
development is sufficient.
7. Stopping Reaction
◦ Add the stop solution to halt the enzymatic reaction.
8. Reading
◦ Read the optical density (OD) of each well at 450 nm (with a
reference filter, if available, usually 620-650 nm) using an
ELISA reader.
6.3. Quality Control
• Run positive and negative controls with every batch of tests to
ensure assay performance.
• Verify that control results fall within the established range before
interpreting patient results.
1. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
• Calculate the cut-off value according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
• Determine the presence or absence of CHIKUNGUNYA IgM and
IgG antibodies in patient serum based on the OD values:
◦ Positive: OD value above the cut-off.
◦ Negative: OD value below the cut-off.
◦ Equivocal: OD value around the cut-off range; re-test or
perform confirmatory testing as needed.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Enter results into the laboratory information system (LIS) and
validate them.
• Document any unusual findings or deviations from the expected
ranges and inform the supervisor if necessary.
1. LIMITATIONS
• Interpret the results in the context of the patient's clinical picture
and other diagnostic findings.
• False positives or negatives may occur; consider repeat testing or
an alternative method for confirmation if results are inconclusive.

and IgG ELISA kit.

infection diagnostics.
1. REVIEW AND REVISION
• This SOP should be reviewed annually or whenever new
reagents, kits, or methods are introduced.
• Changes and updates should be documented, and all concerned
personnel should be trained accordingly.
