STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase Procedure for Testing CHIKUNGUNYA
IgM Antibody in Serum Samples
1. PURPOSE
To outline the analytical procedure for testing CHIKUNGUNYA IgM
antibodies in serum samples using enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay (ELISA) methods to ensure consistent, accurate, and timely
results.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel performing
CHIKUNGUNYA IgM ELISA tests at our CLIA-certified laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for the correct
preparation, processing, and analysis of serum samples for
CHIKUNGUNYA IgM antibodies.
4. DEFINITIONS
CHIKUNGUNYA IgM: Immunoglobulin M antibodies specific to the
CHIKUNGUNYA virus, indicative of a recent infection. ELISA:
Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay, a test used to detect
antibodies in the blood.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• ELISA microplate reader
• Incubator (37°C)
• Microcentrifuge
• Adjustable micropipettes and disposable tips
• Multichannel pipette
• ELISA kit for CHIKUNGUNYA IgM detection, which includes:
◦ Microtiter plates pre-coated with CHIKUNGUNYA antigen
◦ Conjugate reagent
◦ Substrate solution
◦ Stop solution
◦ Wash buffer
◦ Positive and negative control sera
◦ Sample diluent
6. SAMPLE REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type: Blood collected in serum separator tubes (SST).
Specimen Volume: Minimum 1 mL of serum. Stability: Serum
samples must be tested within 7 days of collection if stored at 2-8°C
or within 3 months if stored at -20°C.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples
• Samples with no collection date or time indicated on the sample
container or requisition
7. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Bring all reagents and samples to room temperature (20-25°C)
before use.
2. Label a sufficient number of microtiter plate wells for each
control and sample.
Assay Procedure:
1. Prepare wash buffer as indicated in the kit insert.
2. Add 100 µL of sample diluent to all sample wells.
3. Add 10 µL of patient serum sample, positive control, and
negative control into their respective wells. Mix thoroughly by
gently tapping the side of the plate.
4. Incubate the plate for 30 minutes at 37°C.
5. Wash the wells 5 times using prepared wash buffer. Ensure
complete removal of wash buffer after the final wash by tapping
the plate on absorbent paper.
6. Add 100 µL of conjugate reagent to each well, except blank
wells.
7. Incubate the plate for 30 minutes at 37°C.
8. Wash the wells 5 times.
9. Add 100 µL of substrate solution to each well.
10. Incubate the plate at room temperature in the dark for 10-15
minutes.
11. Add 50 µL of stop solution to each well. Tap the plate gently to
mix.
Reading Results:
1. Measure the absorbance at 450 nm using an ELISA microplate
reader within 30 minutes of stopping the reaction.
2. Calculate results using the dual wavelength absorbance (450
nm with reference 620 nm as recommended by the kit insert).
8. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run positive and negative controls with each assay to ensure the
test is functioning correctly.
• Repeat any assays with controls outside the established
acceptable range.
• Document all QC results and corrective actions taken.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
Reference Intervals:
• Positive: Absorbance above the cutoff value (established by the
kit manufacturer).
• Negative: Absorbance below the cutoff value (established by the
kit manufacturer).
• Indeterminate: Absorbance near the cutoff; repeat testing may be
required.
Documentation:
• Record results in the laboratory information system (LIS).
• Enter and verify results following standard laboratory protocols.
Critical Results:
• Report positive CHIKUNGUNYA IgM results immediately to the
corresponding healthcare provider.
