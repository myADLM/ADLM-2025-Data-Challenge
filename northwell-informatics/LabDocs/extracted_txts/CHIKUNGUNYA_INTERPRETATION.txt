Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for CHIKUNGUNYA INTERPRETATION
1. PURPOSE
To ensure accurate and timely processing, analysis, and
interpretation of Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) test results in a clinical
laboratory setting.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for carrying out the
procedures outlined in this SOP, including processing specimens,
performing assays, interpreting results, and documenting findings.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred Specimens:
• Whole blood (EDTA or serum separator tubes)
• Serum
• Plasma
Specimen Stability:
• Specimen must be stored at 2-8°C if used within 48 hours or can
be frozen at -70°C for longer periods.
• Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Centrifuge
• PCR Instrument (e.g., real-time thermocycler)
• ELISA Reader (for immunoassays)
• Biosafety cabinet (Class II)
Reagents:
• RNA extraction kits
• CHIKV PCR reagents (Primers and probes, Master mix)
• ELISA kits specific for Chikungunya IgM and IgG antibodies
Supplies:
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Microtubes and microplates
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
• Disinfectants and waste containers
5. PROCEDURE
RNA Extraction:
1. Follow the manufacturer's protocol for RNA extraction using
clinical specimens.
2. Ensure that all the necessary controls (positive and negative)
are included in the extraction process.
3. Transfer the extracted RNA to labeled microtubes and store at
-70°C until PCR setup.
PCR Analysis:
1. Prepare the PCR Master Mix with appropriate primers, probes,
and reagents.
2. Aliquot RNA samples into PCR reaction tubes or plate wells.
3. Include positive, negative, and internal controls in each run.
4. Perform real-time PCR using the thermocycler following the
thermal cycling conditions recommended by the kit
manufacturer.
5. Analyze the PCR data for amplification curves, Ct values, and
confirm the presence of CHIKV RNA.
ELISA Analysis:
1. Ensure specimens are brought to room temperature.
2. Follow the manufacturer's protocol for adding specimens,
controls, and reagents to the microplate.
3. Incubate and wash plates according to the stipulated
conditions.
4. Add substrate solution and incubate for the specified time.
5. Measure absorbance using the ELISA reader and interpret the
results based on assay cutoffs.
Interpretation of Results:
PCR Results:
• Positive: Ct values within the detectable range and verified by the
amplification curves.
• Negative: No amplification or amplification beyond the
interpretable Ct range.
• Indeterminate: Presence of abnormal amplification curves; may
require repeat testing.
ELISA Results:
• Positive: Absorbance values above the cutoff range indicating
presence of IgM/IgG antibodies.
• Negative: Absorbance values below the cutoff range.
• Indeterminate: Ambiguous absorbance readings; require
reconfirmation.
6. DOCUMENTATION AND REPORTING
1. Record all results in the laboratory information system (LIS) and
review thoroughly.
2. Ensure all patient data, specimen details, and test findings are
accurately entered.
3. Cross-verify results with the designated supervisor before final
reporting.
4. Report critical results promptly in accordance with laboratory
policy.
5. Document any repeat or indeterminate results and the actions
taken.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Perform daily controls including RNA extraction controls, PCR
controls, and ELISA controls.
2. Keep records of all quality control measures including
corrective actions taken for any deviations.
3. Ensure all instruments are calibrated and maintain regular
validation schedules.
4. Confirm internal procedural compliance via periodic audits.

9. SAFETY
Ensure strict adherence to laboratory safety protocols including
working within a biosafety cabinet, proper PPE usage, and
appropriate handling and disposal of biohazardous materials.
By following this SOP, designated staff can ensure the accurate and
effective generation of results for Chikungunya interpretation,
conforming to clinical standards and contributing towards the reliable
diagnosis and management of CHIKV infection.
