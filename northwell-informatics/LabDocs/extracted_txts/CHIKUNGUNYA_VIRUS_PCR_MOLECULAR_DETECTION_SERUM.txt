Standard Operating Procedure: CHIKUNGUNYA VIRUS, PCR,
MOLECULAR DETECTION, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this protocol is to provide a standardized
procedure for the detection of Chikungunya virus RNA in serum
samples using PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction). This
protocol outlines the steps for sample preparation, PCR
amplification, and result interpretation to ensure consistency,
accuracy, and reliability of test results.
1. PRINCIPLE
This molecular detection method employs PCR to amplify
Chikungunya virus RNA present in serum samples. Detection is
achieved using specific primers and probes that target
conserved regions of the Chikungunya virus genome. The
amplified RNA is then quantified to confirm the presence of the
virus.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred Specimen:
◦ 2-3 mL of serum, separated from a whole blood sample
collected in a red or gold-top serum separator tube (SST).
Acceptable Specimen:
◦ Serum samples from other validated tube types as per lab
policy (consult with supervisor if unsure).
Unacceptable Specimen:
◦ Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric serum samples.
◦ Specimens not properly labeled or lacking a collection date/
time.
◦ Samples not stored/transported as per guidelines, leading to
possible degradation of RNA (e.g., kept at room temperature
for extended periods).
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
◦ PCR Workstation
◦ Biosafety Cabinet (Class II)
◦ Microcentrifuge
◦ Thermal Cycler
◦ Real-time PCR system
◦ RNA extraction kit
◦ Chikungunya virus-specific primers and probes
◦ PCR master mix
◦ Nuclease-free water
◦ Disposable gloves, pipette tips with filters, and lab coats
◦ Vortex mixer
1. PROCEDURE
A) RNA Extraction
1. Sample Preparation:
◦ Thaw the serum samples on ice if previously frozen.
◦ Vortex each serum sample for 10 seconds.
◦ Centrifuge the samples at 14,000 rpm for 5 minutes to
remove any particulate matter.
◦ Carefully transfer the clarified serum to a fresh nuclease-
free microcentrifuge tube.
2. RNA Extraction:
◦ Follow the RNA extraction kit manufacturer's instructions for
serum samples.
◦ Elute the purified RNA in a final volume of 50 µL of
nuclease-free water.
◦ Store extracted RNA at -80°C if not immediately proceeding
to PCR.
B) PCR Amplification
1. PCR Reaction Set-Up:
◦ Prepare the PCR master mix according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
◦ For each reaction (20 µL total volume):
▪ 10 µL PCR master mix
▪ 5 µL RNA template (extracted RNA)
▪ 1 µL Chikungunya virus-specific primers and probes mix
▪ 4 µL nuclease-free water
◦ Prepare a negative control (nuclease-free water) and a
positive control (Chikungunya virus RNA standard).
2. Thermal Cycling Conditions:
◦ Initial denaturation at 95°C for 10 minutes
◦ 45 cycles of:
▪ Denaturation at 95°C for 15 seconds
▪ Annealing/extension at 60°C for 1 minute
C) Detection and Interpretation
1. Real-Time PCR Analysis:
◦ Perform real-time PCR using an appropriate detection
system (e.g., Applied Biosystems, Roche LightCycler).
◦ Analyze the amplification curves and Ct (cycle threshold)
values to determine the presence of Chikungunya virus
RNA.
2. Result Interpretation:
◦ Positive Result: Ct value below the established threshold for
the Chikungunya virus.
◦ Negative Result: No amplification or a Ct value above the
threshold.
◦ Inconclusive Result: Amplification in the negative control or
failure of the positive control; Re-extract and re-test the
sample.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Include positive and negative controls in each PCR run.
◦ Monitor the performance of primers and probes by including
an internal control.
◦ Document all controls and ensure they meet acceptance
criteria before releasing results.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ Enter the results into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
◦ Verify and release results based on site-specific reporting
guidelines.
◦ Ensure all results are reviewed by a qualified laboratory
scientist before release.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
◦ Negative: No Chikungunya virus RNA detected.
◦ Positive: Chikungunya virus RNA detected.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
◦ This assay is designed for use with human serum. Use of
other specimens may affect the accuracy of results.
◦ Potential for false negatives due to low viral loads or
degradation of RNA.
◦ Reagents must be used within their expiry dates and stored
as per manufacturer’s recommendations.
