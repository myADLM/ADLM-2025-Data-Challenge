Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for CHIKUNGUNYA VIRUS,
PCR, MOLECULAR DETECTION, SPINAL FLUID
1. PURPOSE To provide standardized procedures for the
detection of Chikungunya Virus (CHIKV) RNA in cerebrospinal
fluid (CSF) specimens using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
techniques.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing the
procedure, maintaining the equipment and reagents, documenting
the results, and ensuring all quality controls are in place. It is the
responsibility of the laboratory personnel to report any issues to the
supervisor.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Preferred Specimen:
• Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF): 0.5-1 mL
Stability:
• CSF specimens should be kept at 2-8°C and processed within 48
hours of collection.
• If a delay in testing is expected, the specimen should be frozen at
-70°C.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens collected in anticoagulant tubes containing EDTA,
heparin, or citrate.
• Specimens that are hemolyzed, clotted, or improperly stored.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• PCR thermal cycler
• Microcentrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Pipettes (0.5-10 µL, 20-200 µL, 100-1000 µL)
• RNA extraction kit
• Chikungunya Virus (CHIKV) PCR kit
• Positive and negative control samples
• Nuclease-free water
• Disposable gloves, lab coat, and safety goggles
• 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes
• PCR tubes or plates
1. PROCEDURE
A) RNA Extraction:
1. Add 200 µL of CSF sample to a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.
2. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for the RNA extraction kit
to isolate RNA from the sample.
3. Elute the RNA in 50 µL of nuclease-free water.
4. Store the extracted RNA at -70°C if not used immediately.
B) PCR Setup:
1. Thaw all reagents and samples on ice.
2. Prepare the PCR master mix according to the CHIKV PCR kit
instructions, ensuring inclusion of primers, probes, buffer, and
Taq polymerase.
3. Aliquot the master mix into PCR tubes or plates.
4. Add 5 µL of extracted RNA to each reaction tube/well.
5. Include appropriate controls in each run:
◦ Positive control: known CHIKV RNA template
◦ Negative control: nuclease-free water.
C) Amplification:
1. Place the PCR tubes/plates into the thermal cycler.
2. Program the thermal cycler as follows (conditions may vary
depending on kit specifications):
◦ Initial denaturation at 95°C for 3 minutes.
◦ 45 cycles of:
▪ Denaturation at 95°C for 15 seconds.
▪ Annealing/extension at 60°C for 30 seconds.
3. Start the PCR run.
D) Detection and Documentation:
1. After the PCR run, assess the amplification plots and threshold
cycles (Ct values) using the thermal cycler's software.
2. Record the Ct values.
3. Interpret results based on the Ct values:
Positive: Ct value ≤ 40 indicates the presence of CHIKV RNA.
Negative: Ct value > 40 or undetermined indicates the absence
of CHIKV RNA. Invalid: Improper amplification in controls or
suspect sample, repeat assay if necessary.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run positive and negative controls with each batch of tests.
• Perform equipment calibration and maintenance as per
manufacturer’s guidelines and laboratory policy.
• Regularly review control runs to ensure consistent performance of
reagents and equipment.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Record results in the laboratory information system.
• Report positive results immediately to the ordering physician and
public health authorities if required.
• Document any issues, deviations, or corrective actions taken
during the procedure.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Not applicable for the qualitative detection of CHIKV RNA.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• This assay is specific for the detection of CHIKV RNA; other
related viruses will not be detected.
• Inhibitors in the CSF may affect assay performance.
• False-negative results may occur if RNA degradation happens
during specimen handling or storage.
