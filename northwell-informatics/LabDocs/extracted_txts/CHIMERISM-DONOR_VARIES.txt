Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase:
Generating Results for CHIMERISM-DONOR, VARIES
1. PURPOSE
This procedure outlines the standardized steps for analyzing and
generating results for CHIMERISM-DONOR, VARIES test in a CLIA-
certified laboratory, ensuring accuracy, precision, and consistency in
reporting.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel trained in
chimerism analysis using donor-specific markers. This includes, but
is not limited to, laboratory technologists, supervisors, and quality
control personnel.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
Laboratory technologists are responsible for performing the analysis
in accordance with this SOP. Laboratory supervisors are responsible
for ensuring compliance with the SOP and resolving any issues that
arise during the testing process.
4. DEFINITION
Chimerism analysis involves the detection and quantification of
donor-derived genetic material in the recipient's bloodstream or
tissues post-transplantation.
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
• Specimen Type: Peripheral blood, bone marrow aspirate, or
other relevant tissues as specified
• Preferred Preservative: EDTA (lavender top)
• Volume: Minimum 5 mL of blood specimen
• Storage: Maintain specimens at 2-8°C and process within 24
hours of collection. Transport to the laboratory immediately.
6. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Real-time PCR system or Short Tandem Repeat (STR) analysis
platform
• DNA extraction kits
• Quantitative analysis software
• Reagents and primers/probes specific to donor and recipient
alleles
• Positive and negative control samples
• Laboratory timer and pipettes
7. PROCEDURE
A. DNA Extraction:
1. Preparation:
◦ Wear appropriate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE).
◦ Label all tubes and reagents correctly for each specimen to
be analyzed.
2. Extraction:
◦ Follow the DNA extraction kit protocol to isolate genomic
DNA from the specimen.
◦ Use the extracted DNA immediately for amplification or store
at -20°C if delay is necessary.
B. DNA Quantification:
1. Use a spectrophotometer or fluorometer to measure the
concentration and purity of the extracted DNA.
2. Record the DNA concentration (ng/µL) and ensure the purity
ratio (A260/A280) is within the acceptable range (1.8-2.0).
C. PCR Amplification:
1. Setup:
◦ Prepare the PCR reaction mix according to the real-time
PCR or STR analysis platform instructions.
◦ Include specific primers/probes to amplify donor and
recipient allelic markers.
2. Thermal Cycling:
◦ Program the thermal cycler with cycling conditions as per
the manufacturer’s protocol.
◦ Load the reaction tubes or plates into the thermal cycler.
◦ Run the PCR amplification cycle to completion.
D. Electrophoresis (for STR):
1. Load amplified products onto an agarose gel or capillary
electrophoresis system.
2. Perform electrophoresis as per system protocol to separate
amplified fragments.
E. Data Analysis:
1. Real-time PCR Analysis:
◦ Use software to analyze amplification curves.
◦ Calculate the percentage of donor-derived DNA in the
specimen.
2. STR Analysis:
◦ Use analysis software to measure peak heights or areas of
amplified alleles.
◦ Calculate chimerism percentage based on relative peak
heights/areas.
F. Quality Control:
1. Run positive controls (known donor DNA) and negative controls
(no template DNA) with each batch of tests.
2. Confirm that control results are within expected ranges before
accepting test results.
3. Re-test any specimen if control results are out of range.
G. Troubleshooting:
1. If results are inconclusive or fall outside expected ranges,
ensure:
◦ All reagents are within expiry date and stored correctly.
◦ Equipment is functioning correctly and calibrated.
◦ Procedures for DNA extraction, PCR setup, and analysis are
followed precisely.
◦ Process a repeat DNA extraction and amplification if
necessary.
8. REPORTING RESULTS:
1. Review and validate results against control and reference
values.
2. Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
3. Report positive chimerism as a percentage and provide
interpretive comments where necessary.
4. Highlight any discrepancies and escalate to a supervisor for
review if needed.
9. RECORD KEEPING:
Document all procedures, reagent details, control results, and final
analysis in laboratory logs or electronic records. Retain records
according to laboratory policy and regulatory requirements.
10. REFERENCES
Include references from scientific literature, manufacturer's
instructions for equipment and reagents, and internal laboratory
protocols.
These steps ensure the generation of reliable and reproducible data
for monitoring donor chimerism post-transplantation, integral to
patient care and treatment planning.
