Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Chimerism-Recipient Germline (Pretransplant) Testing
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedure for performing
Chimerism-Recipient Germline (Pretransplant) testing in the
laboratory to ensure accuracy and reliability of test results. This
involves analyzing DNA specimens from transplant recipients to
establish baseline germline profiles prior to transplantation.
Responsibility:
• All laboratory technologists performing Chimerism-Recipient
Germline testing must follow this procedure.
• The designated supervisor ensures compliance and oversees the
quality control of the procedure.
2. SCOPE
This protocol applies to all DNA analyses conducted for the purpose
of Chimerism-Recipient Germline testing.
3. DEFINITIONS
Chimerism: Presence of two or more genetically distinct cell
populations in an individual as a result of hematopoietic stem cell
transplantation.
Recipient Germline (Pretransplant): The genetic profile of the
transplant recipient before undergoing any transplantation procedure.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type:
• Peripheral blood (preferred)
• Bone marrow aspirate (acceptable alternative)
Collection Tube:
• Peripheral blood: EDTA tube (lavender top)
• Bone marrow: EDTA tube (lavender top)
Specimen Volume:
• Peripheral blood: Minimum of 5 mL
• Bone marrow aspirate: Minimum of 1 mL
Storage and Transport:
• Store and transport specimens at 2-8°C
• Specimens should be tested within 7 days of collection
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Automated DNA extractor (e.g., Qiagen QIAcube)
• DNA quantification equipment (e.g., NanoDrop
spectrophotometer)
• PCR thermal cycler
• Capillary electrophoresis system (e.g., ABI Genetic Analyzer)
• PCR reagents and primer sets specific for chimerism analysis
• 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes
• Pipettes and filter tips
• Vortex mixer and microcentrifuge
6. PROCEDURE
A) DNA Extraction:
1. Label all samples and controls appropriately.
2. Use an automated DNA extractor or perform manual DNA
extraction as per the standard DNA extraction protocol.
3. Quantify the extracted DNA using a NanoDrop
spectrophotometer to ensure sufficient yield and purity (A260/
A280 ratio should be between 1.8 and 2.0).
4. Dilute the DNA to a final concentration of 10 ng/µL using
nuclease-free water.
B) PCR Amplification:
1. Prepare the PCR reaction mixture including:
◦ 2x PCR Master Mix
◦ 10 µM Forward and Reverse primers
◦ Extracted DNA (10 ng/µL)
◦ Nuclease-free water to final reaction volume (usually 25 µL)
2. Vortex and briefly spin the PCR master mix before aliquoting
into PCR tubes.
3. Load the PCR tubes into the thermal cycler and run the
chimerism-specific PCR program (denaturation, annealing, and
elongation cycles according to primer specifications).
C) Capillary Electrophoresis:
1. Prepare the PCR products for capillary electrophoresis.
2. Denature the PCR products as per instruction manual of
capillary electrophoresis system.
3. Load the prepared DNA samples into the capillary
electrophoresis instrument.
4. Set appropriate run parameters and start the run.
D) Data Analysis:
1. Analyze the electropherograms to identify specific alleles and
establish the individual’s germline profile.
2. Compare the peaks obtained from the recipient's DNA to
validate the results.
E) Quality Control and Validation:
1. Include positive and negative controls in each run.
2. If controls fail, troubleshoot the procedure before repeating.
3. Ensure result consistency through periodic proficiency testing.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Review the analytical data to ensure accuracy.
2. Generate a report with the recipient’s germline profile details.
3. Document and verify the results as per standard laboratory
protocols.
4. Ensure the report includes all relevant information including
patient ID, sample ID, date of extraction, and chimerism test
results.
