Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analyzing and
Generating Results for Chimerism Transplant No Cell Sort,
Varies
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the procedure for the analysis and generation of
results for Chimerism Transplant No Cell Sort. It ensures consistency,
accuracy, and reproducibility of results within the laboratory.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for conducting the
analysis, generating results, and documenting all necessary
information as outlined in this SOP. It is critical for staff to adhere to
these procedures to maintain quality and accuracy of results.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENT
Specimen collection and accession are addressed in pre-analytical
SOPs. For Chimerism Transplant No Cell Sort, the specimen typically
received is bone marrow or peripheral blood. The samples should be
processed promptly and handled according to pre-established
standards appropriate for this assay type.
3. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
• PCR thermocycler
• Capillary electrophoresis systems
• Chimerism-specific assay kits
• Consents consumables (Pipettes, tips, tubes, etc.)
• Calibrated micropipettes and repeaters
• Lab coats, gloves, and safety glasses
4. REAGENTS AND CONTROLS
• Chimerism reaction mix
• DNA polymerase (as specified by kit manufacturer)
• Positive and negative controls from the kit
• DNase/RNase-free water
• DNA ladder/standard
5. PROCEDURE
A. DNA Extraction:
1. Extract DNA from the received specimen using a validated DNA
extraction kit.
2. Quantify and assess the quality of extracted DNA using a
Nanodrop or equivalent.
3. Proceed only with samples meeting the minimum concentration
and purity criteria set (A260/280 ratio between 1.8 to 2.0).
B. PCR Amplification:
1. Prepare the PCR master mix according to the chimerism assay
kit instructions.
2. Add appropriate concentration of DNA template to the master
mix in PCR tubes.
3. Include positive and negative controls in each run.
4. Place tubes in a PCR cycler and run the program as described
in the kit instructions.
5. Upon completion of PCR, store amplified products at 4°C until
further analyzed.
C. Capillary Electrophoresis:
1. Prepare samples for electrophoresis by combining PCR
products with loading buffer and size standard.
2. Load samples into the capillary electrophoresis machine as per
manufacturer's instructions.
3. Enter run parameters and start the electrophoresis process.
4. Validate the electrophoresis data by reviewing the
electropherogram profiles for each sample.
D. Data Analysis:
1. Use chimerism analysis software provided with the kit to
generate percentage chimerism results from the
electropherogram data.
2. Ensure clear distinction is made between host and donor alleles
in the analysis.
3. Cross-check and validate the results with the controls to ensure
assay reliability.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Ensure all reagent kits and controls are within expiration dates.
2. Run positive and negative control samples with each batch of
patient samples to monitor assay performance.
3. Record all QC measurements and compare with set thresholds.
4. Report and resolve any QC failures before proceeding with
patient sample analysis.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Document results in the Chimerism Transplant Report template.
2. Review and verify the results by comparing to previous
chimerism data, if available.
3. Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
ensuring accuracy and compliance with laboratory reporting
standards.
4. Generate a comprehensive report for the referring healthcare
provider, noting any discrepancies between pre- and post-
transplant chimerism levels.
8. REFERENCES
Refer to the manufacturer's package insert for detailed protocols for
the chimerism assay kit being used. Further SOPs related to DNA
extraction, PCR amplification, and data analysis should be consulted
for comprehensive guidelines.

10. REVISION HISTORY
• Revision date: October 2023
• Next review date: As per laboratory policy
11. AUTHORIZATION
This SOP has been reviewed and approved by the laboratory director
and quality manager.
Note: Lab personnel must receive training on this SOP and
demonstrate competency prior to performing the procedure
independently. Regular reviews and audits should be conducted to
ensure compliance with the SOP.
