STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP)
Title: Chimerism Analysis in Sorted Cells
1. PURPOSE
This SOP provides instructions for the analysis and reporting of
chimerism in sorted cells of post-transplant patients using short
tandem repeat (STR) analysis. The aim is to accurately quantify the
proportion of recipient and donor cells to monitor engraftment and
detect any signs of graft rejection or relapse.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory staff with appropriate training in DNA
extraction, PCR, and STR analysis will perform the procedures. It is
the responsibility of the laboratory manager to ensure that all
equipment is calibrated, reagents are quality controlled, and staff are
competent in their tasks.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all sorted cell samples received in the
laboratory for chimerism analysis. The protocol includes DNA
extraction, PCR amplification of STR loci, capillary electrophoresis,
and data analysis.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimens: Sorted cell populations (e.g., T-cells, B-cells, myeloid
cells) collected in EDTA or ACD tubes.
• Minimum volume: 1 x 10^6 cells per sorted population.
• Upon receipt, inspect specimens for proper labeling, sufficient
volume, and no signs of hemolysis or clotting.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Nucleic acid extraction kits (e.g., Qiagen DNA Mini Kit)
• STR amplification kit (e.g., PowerPlex 16 HS System)
• PCR Thermocycler
• Capillary electrophoresis system (e.g., ABI 3500 Genetic
Analyzer)
• Lysis buffer, TE buffer, Ethanol, etc.
• Pipettes, tips, tubes, centrifuge, vortex mixer
• Relevant software for data analysis (e.g., GeneMapper)
5. PROCEDURE
Step 1: DNA Extraction
1.1. Transfer sorted cells into appropriately labeled 1.5 mL
microcentrifuge tubes.
1.2. Add 200 µL of lysis buffer and 20 µL proteinase K. Vortex to mix.
1.3. Incubate at 56°C for 1 hour.
1.4. Add 200 µL ethanol and mix thoroughly by vortexing.
1.5. Transfer mixture to a spin column and centrifuge at 8000 rpm for
1 minute.
1.6. Wash the column with 500 µL of wash buffer. Centrifuge and
discard filtrate.
1.7. Repeat wash step once more.
1.8. Elute DNA by adding 100 µL of TE buffer to the column and
centrifuge.
1.9. Quantify DNA using a spectrophotometer and store at -20°C until
further use.
Step 2: PCR Amplification
2.1. Prepare PCR mix according to the manufacturer’s instructions of
the STR kit.
2.2. Add 1–5ng of extracted DNA to the PCR mix. Vortex and
centrifuge briefly.
2.3. Program the thermocycler as follows: Initial denaturation at 95°C
for 11 minutes, followed by 30 cycles of 94°C for 1 minute, 60°C for 1
minute, 72°C for 1 minute, and a final extension of 60°C for 25
minutes.
2.4. Keep the amplified product at 4°C until capillary electrophoresis.
Step 3: Capillary Electrophoresis
3.1. Prepare the capillary electrophoresis system and load the
samples.
3.2. Ensure the instrument is calibrated with a size standard.
3.3. Run the samples following the system protocol.
3.4. Analyze the STR profiles using GeneMapper or equivalent
software.
Step 4: Data Analysis
4.1. Compare donor and recipient allelic profiles to determine the
proportion of donor and recipient DNA in each sorted cell population.
4.2. Calculate chimerism percentage according to the following
formula:
(Peak area of donor alleles / Total peak area) * 100
4.3. Interpret results for clinical or research use.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include a positive control (known donor and recipient DNA) and a
negative control (no DNA) in each batch.
• STR Kit calibrators must be run to validate instrument
performance.
• Any deviation in control results must be reviewed, and results not
reported until the issue is resolved.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
• Report chimerism percentages as part of the laboratory report.
• Indicate if the results show full donor chimerism, mixed
chimerism, or recipient chimerism.
• Document any observed technical issues or deviations from
standard procedure.
