Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase:
Generating Results for Chlamydia IgG, Immunofluorescence,
Serum
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for the analysis of Chlamydia IgG in serum
samples using immunofluorescence to ensure consistent, accurate,
and reliable results.
1. SPECIMEN
Acceptable Specimen:
◦ Serum collected in SST (serum separator tube) or plain red-
top tube.
◦ Preferred volume: 1-2 mL of serum.
◦ Specimen should be separated from cells within 2 hours of
collection and stored at 2-8°C if analysis is delayed.
Unacceptable Specimen:
◦ Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric specimens.
◦ Specimens with volume less than 0.5 mL.
◦ Clotted whole blood, plasma, or non-serum specimens.
2. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
◦ Fluorescence microscope
◦ Chlamydia trachomatis IgG antibody kit
◦ Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)
◦ Mounting medium (e.g., glycerol/PBS)
◦ Pipettes and tips
◦ Glass slides and cover slips
◦ Incubator set at 37°C
◦ Positive and negative control sera
◦ Calibrated timer
◦ Centrifuge
3. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Ensure all reagents, controls, and serum samples are
brought to room temperature prior to testing.
2. Label glass slides with sample identification numbers.
Sample and Control Preparation:
1. Dilute serum samples 1:20 in PBS (e.g., 10 µL serum +
190 µL PBS).
2. Prepare positive and negative control sera according to
the manufacturer's instructions.
Assay Procedure:
1. Coating Slides: Add 20 µL of diluted serum sample onto
the designated well on the glass slide.
2. Incubation: Place slides in a humid chamber and
incubate at 37°C for 30 minutes.
3. Rinsing: Carefully rinse slides with PBS to remove
unattached antibodies. Repeat this step to ensure
complete removal.
4. Conjugate Addition: Add 20 µL of FITC-conjugated anti-
human IgG to each well. Incubate at 37°C for 30 minutes
in a humid chamber.
5. Rinse and Dry: Rinse slides with PBS, followed by
distilled water, to remove excess conjugate. Allow slides
to air dry.
6. Mounting: Apply a small drop of mounting medium on
each well, and place a cover slip over the slide.
Microscopic Examination:
1. Examine slides under the fluorescence microscope at
400x magnification.
2. Evaluate for the presence of apple-green fluorescence in
a stippled pattern, indicating a positive result.
3. Record the intensity of fluorescence (e.g., 1+, 2+, 3+, 4+)
based on control reactions.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Run positive and negative controls with each batch of tests.
◦ Slides must be examined by a qualified technologist.
◦ Document all quality control results before proceeding with
sample analysis.
◦ If controls do not perform as expected, investigate and
resolve issues before proceeding with patient samples.
5. RESULTS REPORTING
◦ Document findings in the laboratory information system
(LIS).
◦ Report positive results with the fluorescence intensity scale.
◦ Provide negative results as "Non-reactive."
6. REFERENCE INTERVALS
◦ Positive: Fluorescence detected, reported with intensity.
◦ Negative: No fluorescence detected.
7. LIMITATIONS
◦ Cross-reactivity may occur with other bacterial pathogens;
confirm results with clinical correlation and additional testing
if needed.
◦ Hemolyzed or lipemic samples may interfere with
fluorescence detection.
