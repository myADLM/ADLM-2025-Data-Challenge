Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Chlamydia IgM and IgG
Panel, Immunofluorescence, Serum
1. PURPOSE
This document outlines the Standard Operating Procedures for the
analytical phase of generating results for Chlamydia IgM and IgG
Panel using Immunofluorescence on serum samples.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel responsible for
processing and analyzing serum samples for the Chlamydia IgM and
IgG panel using immunofluorescence techniques.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of designated laboratory personnel to follow this
SOP and ensure accurate and reliable results. Laboratory
supervisors must ensure that all staff are trained and proficient in this
procedure.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Serum
• Collection Tubes: Collect blood in SST (serum separator tube)
• Volume Required: Minimum of 1 mL serum
• Specimen Stability:
◦ Room Temperature: Stable for up to 24 hours
◦ Refrigerated (2-8°C): Stable for up to 7 days
◦ Frozen (-20°C or colder): Stable for 6 months
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, icteric, or lipemic serum samples
• Samples received in incorrect collection tubes or without proper
labeling
5. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Immunofluorescence microscope
• Chlamydia IgM and IgG immunofluorescence assay kit
• PBS buffer, pH 7.2
• Humid chamber
• Fluorescent-labeled anti-human IgM and IgG secondary
antibodies
• Cover slips and slides
• Serum sample dilution plates
• Control samples (positive and negative)
6. PROCEDURE
6.1 Preparation:
1. Ensure that the immunofluorescence microscope and
associated equipment are in proper working condition.
2. Bring all reagents, serum samples, and control samples to
room temperature before starting the assay.
3. Prepare the humid chamber by adding a moistened paper towel
to maintain humidity during incubation steps.
6.2 Assay Steps:
1. Serum Dilution:
◦ Dilute each serum sample 1:20 in PBS buffer in a dilution
plate.
2. Antigen Slide Preparation:
◦ Apply a small amount of each diluted serum sample to
separate wells of the antigen slide.
◦ Include one well for positive control and one for negative
control.
3. Incubation:
◦ Incubate the slides in the humid chamber at 37°C for 30
minutes.
4. Washing:
◦ Remove slides from the humid chamber and wash gently
with PBS buffer to remove unbound antibodies. Repeat
wash three times, 5 minutes each.
5. Application of Secondary Antibody:
◦ Apply fluorescent-labeled anti-human IgM to the appropriate
wells on the slide for IgM detection and anti-human IgG for
IgG detection.
◦ Incubate the slides again at 37°C for 30 minutes in the
humid chamber.
6. Final Wash:
◦ Repeat the washing step as described above to remove
unbound secondary antibodies.
7. Mounting:
◦ Apply a drop of mounting medium onto each well of the slide
and cover with cover slips.
6.3 Microscopy:
1. Examine the prepared slides using the immunofluorescence
microscope.
2. Observe for specific fluorescent staining patterns and record
the intensity of fluorescence:
◦ Positive Result: Clear and specific fluorescence in the
appropriate pattern for each control and patient sample.
◦ Negative Result: No specific fluorescence observed.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Run positive and negative controls with each batch of samples.
2. Document control results in the quality control log and ensure
they are within acceptable ranges before proceeding with
patient samples.
3. If controls do not meet acceptance criteria, repeat the assay
and investigate potential sources of error.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Record all observations and fluorescence intensity for IgM and
IgG in the laboratory information system (LIS).
2. Review and verify all results before final reporting.
3. Notify the ordering physician or clinician of critical or abnormal
results according to laboratory protocol.
