Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Chlamydia IgM
Immunofluorescence Assay
1. PURPOSE
To provide a detailed approach for the analysis and interpretation of
Chlamydia IgM antibodies in serum using immunofluorescence
techniques to ensure accurate and reliable results.
2. SCOPE
This protocol applies to all laboratory personnel performing
Chlamydia IgM Immunofluorescence Assay (IFA) on serum
specimens in a CLIA-certified laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• All laboratory personnel performing the assay must adhere to this
SOP.
• The supervisor is responsible for ensuring that all staff are trained
and compliant with this SOP.
• Designated personnel are responsible for maintaining and
calibrating the equipment used in the assay.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS & STORAGE
• Acceptable Specimen: Serum collected in an SST (Serum
Separator Tube) or red-top tube.
• Volume required: Minimum 1 mL of serum.
• Specimen stability:
◦ Room Temperature: 2 hours.
◦ Refrigerated: Up to 7 days at 2-8°C.
◦ Frozen: Long-term storage at -20°C or lower.
• Unacceptable Specimens:
◦ Hemolyzed samples.
◦ Specimens containing particulate matter.
◦ Samples stored at inappropriate temperatures.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Immunofluorescence microscope.
• Chlamydia IgM IFA kit.
• Fluorescein-labeled anti-human IgM conjugate.
• Incubator set to 37°C.
• Micropipettes.
• Timer.
• Humid chamber.
• Positive and negative control sera.
• Wash buffer (PBS, pH 7.2).
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Use positive and negative control sera with each batch of tests.
• Record control results in the Quality Control log.
• Acceptable results must fall within established ranges.
7. PROCEDURE
Specimen Preparation:
1. Allow serum specimens and controls to come to room
temperature before testing.
Assay Procedure:
1. Preparation of Reagents:
◦ Allow all reagents and materials to reach room temperature.
◦ Prepare wash buffer according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
2. Antigen Slide Preparation:
◦ Remove IFA slides from the kit and label each well with
corresponding patient ID or control.
◦ Add a standard volume of the patient’s serum to the
assigned wells. Typically, 20 µL per well is used.
◦ Add the provided positive and negative controls to their
respective wells.
3. Incubation:
◦ Place slides in a humid chamber and incubate at 37°C for
30 minutes.
4. Washing:
◦ Wash the slides gently with wash buffer for 5 minutes.
Repeat wash 2 more times (total of 3 washes).
5. Conjugate Addition:
◦ Dispense an appropriate volume (e.g., 20 µL) of fluorescein-
labeled anti-human IgM conjugate to each well.
◦ Re-incubate in a humid chamber at 37°C for 30 minutes.
6. Final Washing:
◦ Wash slides again as described in Step 4.
7. Mounting:
◦ After the final wash, carefully blot slides dry around the
wells, avoiding the specimen areas.
◦ Mount coverslip onto the slide using a suitable mounting
medium.
Microscopy Examination:
1. Examine:
◦ Using the immunofluorescence microscope, examine each
well under the proper magnification for fluorescence
patterns.
◦ Record intensity and pattern of fluorescence for each patient
and control serum as positive or negative.
8. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
• Positive Result: Bright apple-green fluorescence indicates the
presence of Chlamydia IgM antibodies.
• Negative Result: No detectable fluorescence (dark field).
• Equivocal Result: Weak or questionable fluorescence; repeat the
test or request a new specimen.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
• Positive results should be verified by a senior technologist and
reported in accordance with laboratory reporting guidelines.
• Report results electronically via the Laboratory Information
System (LIS), ensuring proper documentation.
• Critical findings should be reported immediately to the requesting
clinician.
10. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions for the Chlamydia IgM IFA kit.
• Laboratory quality control and assurance manual.
• Relevant standards set out by national regulatory and
accreditation bodies.
11. TROUBLESHOOTING
• Inconsistent control results: Repeat the assay with fresh controls
and reagents.
• Low signal/no fluorescence: Ensure proper functionality of the
immunofluorescence microscope and check for reagent
expiration.
12. DOCUMENTATION
• Maintain records of all specimens processed, including patient
information, test results, and quality control log.
• Ensure all steps are signed off by the responsible technologist
performing the assay.
13. SAFETY PRECAUTIONS
• Adhere to standard laboratory safety protocols.
• Dispose of biological waste according to biohazard disposal
guidelines.
• Use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) at all times.
This protocol is intended to ensure the accurate and consistent
performance of Chlamydia IgM Immunofluorescence Assays and
compliance with all relevant laboratory standards and regulations.
