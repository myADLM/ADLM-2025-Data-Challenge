SOP for the Analytical Phase of Generating Results for
Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae from
Miscellaneous Sites using Nucleic Acid Amplification
1. PURPOSE
To define the procedures for performing nucleic acid amplification
tests (NAAT) for the detection of Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) and
Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) from various specimen types.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory staff will be responsible for performing the test
procedures in strict adherence to this SOP. It is the responsibility of
all staff to ensure proper documentation and handling of all
specimens, adherence to quality control procedures, and timely
notification of the supervisor in case of any procedural deviations,
instrument malfunctions, or quality control failures.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STORAGE
Specimen Types:
• Swabs from miscellaneous sites such as rectal, pharyngeal,
conjunctival, and others as specified by the clinician.
• Urine samples as specified for CT/NG testing.
Specimen Collection:
• Ensure use of appropriate collection devices provided by the
testing kit, which contain transport media suitable for nucleic acid
preservation.
• Clearly label all samples with patient identification and specimen
collection date/time.
Specimen Storage:
• Store specimens at 2-8°C until testing if testing will be performed
within 72 hours.
• If not performed within 72 hours, specimens should be frozen at
-20°C or colder.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Real-time PCR instrument (e.g., Cepheid GeneXpert, Roche
Cobas, Hologic Panther, etc.)
• Calibrated pipettes and tips
• Vortex mixer
• Centrifuge
Reagents:
• Nucleic acid extraction kits
• PCR master mixes specific for Chlamydia trachomatis and
Neisseria gonorrhoeae
• Positive and negative controls
• Molecular grade water
Supplies:
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
• Sterile, RNase/DNase-free tubes
• Specimen collection devices
1. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Processing:
1. Specimen Reception:
◦ Confirm and document the receipt of specimens, ensuring
all are properly labeled.
◦ Perform an initial visual inspection for specimen integrity
and proper labeling.
2. Sample Preparation:
◦ Transfer specimen to a clean microcentrifuge tube if
necessary, being mindful of cross-contamination.
◦ Perform nucleic acid extraction according to the specific
NAAT kit manufacturer's instructions.
B. Nucleic Acid Amplification:
1. Reaction Setup:
◦ Prepare the reaction mix in a clean area dedicated to PCR
setup, include appropriate controls (positive and negative).
◦ Add the extracted nucleic acids to the reaction mix as per
the NAAT kit instructions.
◦ Carefully load the reaction mixtures into the PCR
instrument.
2. Amplification:
◦ Program the thermal cycler with the appropriate conditions
specified by the NAAT kit instructions (denaturation,
annealing, and extension steps).
C. Post-Amplification Analysis:
1. Result Interpretation:
◦ After amplification, verify the results based on fluorescence
detection as advised by the NAAT kit.
◦ Compare the signals obtained from the samples to those of
the control reactions.
◦ Document the results, noting any anomalies that might call
for a repeat or further investigation.
2. Quality Control:
◦ Ensure that all controls have produced expected results
before validating the patient results.
◦ If any control fails, identify the source of error (e.g., reagent
contamination, instrument fault) and rectify before re-
running the test for affected samples.
3. REPORTING RESULTS:
• Transmit results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS),
ensuring proper linkage to patient identification.
• Review and verify the results. Flag and follow up on any results
needing further interpretation or action.
• For positive results, note the presence of Chlamydia trachomatis
and/or Neisseria gonorrhoeae.
• For negative results, confirm that the sample has tested negative
for both pathogens under the testing conditions.
1. SAMPLE INTEGRITY CHECKS:
• If sample integrity is in question (e.g., presence of inhibitory
substances), repeat the test if necessary on a new aliquot of the
specimen.
• Document any issues and the steps taken to resolve them.
1. QUALITY ASSURANCE:
• Participate in external proficiency testing programs as available.
• Consistently adhere to manufacturer instructions and update
SOPs as needed, based on new information or procedural
changes.
• Regularly perform intralaboratory QC checks, and maintain up-to-
date records of instrument maintenance and reagent lot
validations.
1. REFERENCES:
• Manufacturer's product inserts and recommendations for the
specific NAAT kits used.
• Current CLIA regulations and guidelines for molecular
diagnostics.
Note: Ensure all personnel performing these procedures are
appropriately trained and competent in molecular testing practices.
Annual reviews of competency and adherence to updated protocols
are mandatory.
This protocol serves as a guideline for Nucleic Acid Amplification
testing for the detection of Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria
gonorrhoeae from miscellaneous specimen sites. Following these
steps ensures accurate and reliable testing in a controlled laboratory
environment to support clinical diagnostics.
