STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP) FOR CHLAMYDIA
TRACHOMATIS AND NEISSERIA GONORRHOEAE NUCLEIC ACID
AMPLIFICATION TESTING
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to provide standardized procedures for
the detection of Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae in
clinical specimens using nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT). This
method ensures accurate, reliable, and reproducible results.
Responsibility:
Designated staff trained in NAAT are responsible for performing and
documenting each step of this procedure. It is the responsibility of all
laboratory personnel to identify any issues affecting test results and
report to a supervisor.
1. DEFINITION
Nucleic Acid Amplification Tests (NAAT) are molecular diagnostic
techniques used to detect the DNA or RNA from Chlamydia
trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae in a clinical specimen.
1. PROCEDURE
A) Specimen Handling and Preparation:
1. Ensure specimens are appropriately collected, received, and
accessioned into the laboratory system.
2. Verify that specimens are in acceptable condition and meet the
criteria specified for NAAT (e.g., swabs, urine, etc.).
3. Store specimens at the appropriate conditions as
recommended by the manufacturer’s instructions until testing.
B) Reagent Preparation:
1. Prepare reagents and consumables as instructed by the NAAT
kit manufacturer.
2. Allow reagents to come to room temperature before use, if
specified by the manufacturer.
3. Document lot numbers, expiration dates, and date of
preparation on the reagent log.
C) Sample Preparation:
1. Label nucleic acid extraction tubes with appropriate sample
identifiers.
2. Add the specified volume of each specimen to the extraction
tube, following the manufacturer’s instructions.
3. Add internal control, if applicable, as per manufacturer’s
instructions.
4. Proceed with nucleic acid extraction using the method specified
in the NAAT kit.
D) Nucleic Acid Extraction:
1. Follow the manufacturer's protocol for nucleic acid extraction.
2. Incubate for the required time at the specified temperature.
3. Centrifuge, if applicable, as specified by the protocol.
4. Avoid contamination by using sterile equipment and following
aseptic techniques.
5. Transfer the extracted nucleic acids to the amplification reaction
tubes or wells.
E) Nucleic Acid Amplification:
1. Set up the amplification reaction as per the NAAT kit
manufacturer’s protocol.
2. Add the appropriate volume of extracted nucleic acids to the
prepared reaction mixture.
3. Include positive and negative controls with each run.
4. Seal the reaction tubes or plate as specified to avoid
contamination.
F) Running the Amplification:
1. Place the prepared reaction tubes or plate into the NAAT
instrument.
2. Program the instrument with the amplification parameters
provided by the NAAT kit manufacturer.
3. Start the run and monitor the amplification process.
4. Document the run details including date, time, and technician
initials.
G) Analysis and Interpretation of Results:
1. Once the run is complete, review the amplification data and
interpret the results.
2. Ensure all controls (positive and negative) have given expected
results before interpreting patient results.
3. Report results as positive, negative, or inconclusive based on
the amplification data.
4. If results are inconclusive, repeat the test or follow
manufacturer’s instructions for troubleshooting.
H) Reporting Results:
1. Document results in the laboratory information system (LIS).
2. Review and verify results before releasing to ensure accuracy.
3. Ensure that critical or positive results are communicated to the
ordering physician promptly, following laboratory policy.
4. QUALITY CONTROL:
5. Run quality control samples as per manufacturer instructions
and laboratory protocol.
6. Include positive and negative controls with each batch of
specimens tested.
7. Document all quality control results and take corrective actions
if controls do not meet acceptance criteria.
8. Perform routine maintenance and calibration of NAAT
equipment according to manufacturer’s instructions.
9. Participate in proficiency testing programs and inter-laboratory
comparisons to ensure quality.
