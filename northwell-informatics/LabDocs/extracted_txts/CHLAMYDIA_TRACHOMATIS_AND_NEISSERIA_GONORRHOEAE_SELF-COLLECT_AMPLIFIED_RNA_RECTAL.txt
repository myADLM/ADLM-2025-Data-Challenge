Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Chlamydia trachomatis
and Neisseria gonorrhoeae Testing by amplified RNA, Rectal
Specimen
1. PURPOSE
To provide clear guidelines and procedures for the accurate and
reliable detection of Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria
gonorrhoeae using amplified RNA technology from self-collected
rectal specimens.
2. SCOPE
This protocol applies to all laboratory personnel involved in the
analytical phase of testing for Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisserria
gonorrhoeae.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• It is the responsibility of all laboratory personnel to follow this SOP
and ensure that every test is conducted in accordance with these
procedures.
• The laboratory supervisor is responsible for ensuring that all staff
understand and adhere to this SOP, and for reviewing and
updating it as necessary.
4. SPECIMEN HANDLING
• The specimen should be collected as per the self-collection
instructions provided to the patient.
• Ensure the specimen is received in the appropriate transport
medium and at recommended conditions for storage and
transport.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) instrumentation as
specified by the manufacturer.
Reagents and Supplies:
• Commercially available kits for Chlamydia trachomatis and
Neisseria gonorrhoeae RNA detection (e.g., provided by Hologic,
Roche, or other approved manufacturers).
• RNA extraction reagents and associated equipment.
• Positive and negative control materials specific to the NAAT
method.
• Personal protective equipment (PPE).
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform quality control (QC) with every batch of specimens tested
using positive and negative controls as prescribed by the
manufacture’s instructions.
• Record all QC results in the designated QC logbook.
• A test batch can only be validated if all QC results are within the
acceptable range. If not, follow troubleshooting steps provided by
the manufacturer and repeat the QC process.
7. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation:
1. Wear appropriate PPE.
2. Ensure all specimens and controls are labeled correctly and
placed into designated specimen racks.
3. Perform initial inspection to ensure that there are no signs of
leakage or contamination of specimens.
4. Vortex the specimen collection tubes to ensure even
distribution.
B. Nucleic Acid Extraction:
1. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for nucleic acid
extraction, using automation where available.
2. Record the specimen ID, date, and time of extraction in the
extraction log.
C. Amplification and Detection:
1. Load the extracted nucleic acid and applicable reagents into the
NAAT instrument in accordance with the manufacturer’s
protocol.
2. Ensure that the appropriate controls are included with each run.
3. Start the run on the instrument as directed by the
manufacturer’s operational guidelines.
4. Upon completion, verify that the run has passed the QC
checks.
D. Analysis of Results:
1. Review and print the results generated by the NAAT instrument.
2. Validate the results by comparing the sample data with the
control data.
3. Record the results electronically in the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
E. Troubleshooting and Repeat Testing:
1. In case of failed QC or inconclusive/invalid results, follow the
manufacturer’s troubleshooting guides.
2. Retest using a new aliquot of the residual specimen, if
available.
3. Document all troubleshooting steps, findings, and actions
taken.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Verify and validate test results as per laboratory protocol.
• Enter final validated results into the LIS for reporting.
• Flag and report any critical or out-of-specification results to the
appropriate healthcare provider immediately.
• Maintain confidentiality and data integrity throughout the process.
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the manufacturer’s instruction manual for any specific
limitations and cross-reactivities of the test method.
10. DOCUMENTATION AND RECORD KEEPING
• Maintain all records, including QC, extraction logs, instrument
maintenance logs, and result sheets according to laboratory
standard practices.
• All records should be reviewed periodically or as needed to
ensure compliance and quality assurance.
