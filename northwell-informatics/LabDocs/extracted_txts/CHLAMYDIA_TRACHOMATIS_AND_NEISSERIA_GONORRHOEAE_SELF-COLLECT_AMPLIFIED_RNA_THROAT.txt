Protocol for Analytical Phase of Generating Results for
Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG),
Self-Collect, Amplified RNA, Throat
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is to
outline the analytical phase procedures for generating results for
Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae from self-
collected throat samples using nucleic acid amplification testing
(NAAT) based on RNA.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing
the analytical procedures.
• Laboratory supervisors are responsible for ensuring adherence to
these procedures and for resolving any issues that may arise
during the analytical phase.
2. DEFINITION
Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) for detecting CT and NG
RNA are highly sensitive methods used to diagnose infections
caused by these pathogens. Self-collected throat specimens are
processed using this technique to amplify and detect specific RNA
sequences.
3. PROCEDURE
Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies:
• NAAT instrument (e.g., GeneXpert, Abbott RealTime)
• Specimen collection devices (self-collect throat swabs)
• RNA extraction kit
• Amplification reagents specific for CT and NG
• Appropriate controls (positive and negative)
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
• Disposable pipette tips and micropipettes
• Vortex mixer and centrifuge
• RNase-free water
Specimen Preparation:
1. Verify the specimen integrity and patient information. Ensure
proper labeling and documentation.
2. If the specimen has been stored refrigerated, bring it to room
temperature before commencing the extraction process.
3. Wear appropriate PPE at all times during specimen handling
and processing.
RNA Extraction:
1. Use the RNA extraction kit as per the manufacturer’s
instructions.
2. Introduce the specimen swab into the extraction buffer
thoroughly; vortex and centrifuge as needed.
3. Follow specific instructions to isolate RNA from the throat swab.
4. Transfer the extracted RNA to a clean, labeled microcentrifuge
tube.
Amplification Setup:
1. Prepare the amplification reaction mix with NAAT reagents
specific to CT and NG per the manufacturer's protocol.
2. Add extracted RNA to the reaction mix while avoiding
contamination.
3. Ensure that positive and negative controls are included in the
run.
4. Load the reaction tubes into the NAAT instrument.
Amplification and Detection:
1. Run the NAAT instrument following the manufacturer's
instructions.
2. Monitor the run to ensure that the device is functioning correctly
and all controls behave as expected.
3. Upon completion, retrieve and analyze the results automatically
generated by the instrument.
Interpretation of Results:
1. Examine the amplification curves and detect signals indicative
of CT and NG RNA.
2. Compare the results with control samples to confirm the
presence or absence of the target RNA.
3. Positive results indicate the presence of CT or NG RNA in the
specimen, while negative results indicate the absence.
Quality Control:
1. Ensure that quality control measures are in place, including
running positive and negative controls in each batch.
2. Inspect instrument logs and control results to confirm accurate
performance.
3. Document all quality control procedures and outcomes
associated with each run.
Reporting Results:
1. Verify the results from the NAAT instrument.
2. Document results on a standardized report form and input
information into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
3. Review and authorize the results before release.
4. Communicate critical results according to established reporting
guidelines.

4. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the manufacturer’s insert for specific limitations affecting the
RNA extraction and NAAT processes, including sensitivity and
specificity limitations due to sample handling, inhibition factors, and
instrument limitations.
