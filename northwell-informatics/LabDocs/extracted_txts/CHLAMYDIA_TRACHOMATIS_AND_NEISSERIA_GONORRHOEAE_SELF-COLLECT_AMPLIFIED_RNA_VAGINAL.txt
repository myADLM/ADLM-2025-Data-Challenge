Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical
Phase of Generating Results for Chlamydia
trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Self-Collect,
Amplified RNA, Vaginal
1. PURPOSE
To outline the standardized procedure for the analytical phase of
testing self-collected vaginal specimens for the detection of
Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae using Amplified
RNA techniques. This ensures accuracy, consistency, and reliability
of test results.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel performing the
amplified RNA testing for Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria
gonorrhoeae on self-collected vaginal specimens.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
Laboratory technologists are responsible for following this SOP while
performing the tests. Supervisors are responsible for ensuring
compliance and for addressing any issues that arise during the
testing process.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Acceptable Specimen: Self-collected vaginal swabs, specifically
designed for amplified RNA testing.
• Unacceptable Specimen: Specimens that are improperly
labeled, leaked during transport, or collected using incorrect swab
types.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND MATERIALS
• RNA Amplification reagents and kits (e.g., Hologic Aptima Combo
2 Assay)
• Pipettes and pipette tips (aerosol resistant)
• Vortex mixer
• Microcentrifuge
• Amplification/detection system as specified by the manufacturer
(e.g., Hologic Panther System)
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
6. PROCEDURE
1. Preparation
◦ Verify specimen identification details and ensure specimen
integrity.
◦ Wear appropriate PPE (lab coat, gloves, and eye
protection).
◦ Prepare and calibrate equipment as per manufacturer
guidelines.
2. Specimen Handling
◦ Vortex specimen tubes briefly to ensure specimen
homogeneity.
◦ Aliquot the required volume of specimen into the testing
tube as per manufacturer’s instructions.
3. Amplification Prep
◦ Combine the aliquoted specimen with the amplification
reagents in the testing tube.
◦ Cap the tube and vortex briefly to mix thoroughly.
◦ Centrifuge the tube briefly to ensure the contents are at the
bottom.
4. RNA Amplification
◦ Load the prepared tubes into the designated slots of the
amplification/detection system.
◦ Initiate the amplification process according to the
instrument’s specific protocol.
◦ Monitor the process through the system interface for any
anomalies.
5. Detection
◦ Upon completion of the amplification cycle, the system will
automatically proceed to the detection phase.
◦ Review the generated data for the presence or absence of
target RNA (Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria
gonorrhoeae).
6. Troubleshooting
◦ In the event of a system error or unexpected result, refer to
the manufacturer’s troubleshooting guide.
◦ If a specimen results in an invalid or inconclusive result, re-
extraction and re-testing may be required.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run positive and negative control samples with each batch of
patient specimens.
• Document and review control results to ensure they fall within
expected ranges.
• In case of control failure, do not report patient results until the
issue is resolved and controls are within acceptable limits.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Review and verify all test results in the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
• Release patient results to the Electronic Medical Record (EMR)
following verification.
• Report critical results as per the laboratory’s critical value policy.
9. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Chlamydia trachomatis RNA: Negative (no RNA detected) /
Positive (RNA detected)
• Neisseria gonorrhoeae RNA: Negative (no RNA detected) /
Positive (RNA detected)
10. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Results can be affected by specimen quality, proper handling, and
adherence to this SOP.
• Potential cross-reactivity with non-target organisms should be
considered.
11. REVIEW AND APPROVAL
This SOP is reviewed annually or sooner if necessary, and is
approved by the laboratory director.
