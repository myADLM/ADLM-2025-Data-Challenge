Standard Operating Procedure
Chlamydia trachomatis, Miscellaneous Sites, Nucleic Acid
Amplification
1. PURPOSE
This SOP describes the procedure for the nucleic acid amplification
test (NAAT) for the detection of Chlamydia trachomatis from
miscellaneous sites. This method utilizes a commercially available
NAAT kit designed specifically for Chlamydia trachomatis.
Responsibility:
• Laboratory personnel trained in molecular diagnostics are
responsible for performing the test as described in this SOP.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring adherence to the
procedure and for addressing any technical issues that arise.
1. SPECIMEN
Acceptable Specimen Types:
• Swabs from miscellaneous sites such as throat, rectum,
conjunctiva, or other non-genital locations.
• Specimens must be collected using the appropriate collection kits
as specified by the manufacturer of the NAAT assay.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens not collected using the recommended collection kit.
• Specimens that have leaked or are improperly labeled.
• Specimens with insufficient quantity for testing.
Specimen Handling:
• Specimens should be transported to the lab immediately after
collection.
• Store at 2-8°C if processing is delayed; do not store for more than
24 hours without manufacturer-specific stabilization medium.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
Equipment:
• Real-time PCR instrument compatible with the NAAT kit.
• Biosafety cabinet for specimen handling.
• Vortex mixer and centrifuge.
• Pipettes and sterile pipette tips with aerosol barriers.
Reagents and Supplies:
• NAAT assay kit for Chlamydia trachomatis.
• External controls (positive and negative) for quality control
purposes.
• DNA extraction kit if required by the NAAT protocol.
• Properly labeled sterile tubes for specimen processing.
• Nuclease-free water.
1. PROCEDURE
A) Specimen Preparation:
1. Verify specimen identification and match it with the test
requisition form.
2. Don appropriate PPE and work within a biosafety cabinet.
3. For swabs, transfer the specimen to the sample tube provided
in the NAAT kit as per the manufacturer's instructions.
4. Add the required amount of lysis buffer or transfer medium to
the specimen. Ensure proper mixing by vortexing.
5. If DNA extraction is required, proceed with the extraction
according to the DNA extraction kit protocol.
B) Nucleic Acid Amplification:
1. Thaw and prepare all NAAT reagents according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
2. Label PCR tubes or wells with appropriate identification for
each specimen and control.
3. Add the recommended volume of the prepared specimen to
each tube or well.
4. Add the NAAT reaction mix to each tube or well as specified by
the kit protocol.
5. Include positive and negative controls in each run to validate
the test results.
6. Seal the tubes or plate and load them into the real-time PCR
instrument.
C) PCR Cycle:
1. Program the real-time PCR instrument according to the NAAT
kit instructions for Chlamydia trachomatis.
2. Run the PCR cycles as specified by the manufacturer.
D) Data Analysis:
1. Upon completion of the PCR run, analyze the results using the
software provided with the real-time PCR instrument.
2. Compare each specimen's amplification curve with those of the
controls.
3. Report the specimen as positive, negative, or invalid based on
the amplification results and manufacturer's criteria.
4. Document all findings in the laboratory information system
(LIS).
5. QUALITY CONTROL:
External Quality Control:
• Run positive and negative controls with each batch of specimens.
• Document and review control results to ensure assay
performance.
Internal Quality Control:
• Review previous run QC data to verify the consistency of results.
• Perform routine maintenance and calibration of the PCR
instrument as per manufacturer guidelines.
1. REPORTING RESULTS:
• Review raw data and confirm final results.
• Record the results in the LIS.
• Generate and transmit reports to the requesting physician or
healthcare provider as per laboratory policy.
Reference Intervals:
• Positive: Indicates the detection of Chlamydia trachomatis nucleic
acid.
• Negative: No detection of Chlamydia trachomatis nucleic acid.
• Invalid: Results indicate a possible issue with specimen quality or
amplification process; requires repeat testing.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
• Inappropriate specimen collection or handling may lead to false-
negative results.
• Contamination may lead to false-positive results; adhere strictly to
the protocol.
• Genetic variations or mutations in the target sequence may affect
test accuracy.
• Refer to the NAAT kit insert for specific limitations.
