Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Chlamydia trachomatis, Nucleic Acid
Amplification
1. PURPOSE
This document outlines the standard operating procedures for the
analytical phase of testing for Chlamydia trachomatis using nucleic
acid amplification technology (NAAT). The procedures ensure
accurate, reliable, and timely reporting of results.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel involved in the analysis
of Chlamydia trachomatis by NAAT methodology in a CLIA-certified
laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Laboratory Technologists: Perform assay setup, calibration,
and analysis according to this SOP.
• Supervisors: Ensure adherence to this SOP, troubleshoot issues,
and validate results before reporting.
4. SPECIMEN HANDLING AND STORAGE
• Specimens must be stored at 2-8°C and processed within 14
days. If longer storage is necessary, specimens should be frozen
at -20°C or colder.
• Specimens must be thawed at room temperature before
processing and should not undergo more than one freeze-thaw
cycle.
5. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
• Nucleic acid extraction system
• NAAT assay-specific reagents and consumables
• Pipettes and filter-tips
• Vortex mixer
• Centrifuge
• Thermal cycler (if required by assay)
• Biosafety cabinet
6. REAGENTS
• Nucleic acid extraction kits
• PCR master mix
• Positive and negative controls
• Nuclease-free water
7. PROCEDURE
A) Extraction of Nucleic Acids:
1. Sample Preparation:
◦ Verify and log received specimens.
◦ Label extraction tubes with unique specimen identifiers.
2. Nucleic Acid Extraction:
◦ Follow the manufacturer's instructions for your NAAT
extraction system.
◦ Ensure that all components are at room temperature.
◦ Pipette the specified volume of each reagent as instructed.
◦ Vortex and centrifuge the specimens as required.
3. Specimen Loading:
◦ Transfer the required volume of each specimen into the
prepared extraction tubes.
◦ Add control samples (positive and negative) to assigned
tubes.
4. Run Extraction:
◦ Load tubes into the nucleic acid extraction system.
◦ Initiate the extraction program as per the manufacturer’s
instructions.
◦ Carefully follow recommended parameters for incubation
times and temperatures.
B) PCR Amplification:
1. PCR Setup:
◦ Prepare the PCR master mix on ice, adding reagents in the
specific order provided in the assay documentation.
◦ Vortex and briefly centrifuge the master mix before
aliquoting.
◦ Aliquot master mix into PCR reaction tubes or plates.
2. Sample Addition:
◦ Add extracted nucleic acids to the PCR tubes or wells
containing the PCR master mix.
◦ Include positive and negative controls.
◦ Cap or seal the tubes/plate to prevent contamination.
3. Thermal Cycling:
◦ Load the PCR tubes or plates into the thermal cycler.
◦ Program the thermal cycler with the appropriate settings for
the Chlamydia trachomatis assay.
◦ Start the amplification cycle.
8. Result Analysis:
1. Post-Run Procedures:
◦ Upon completion of the PCR run, carefully remove the PCR
tubes or plates.
◦ Analyze the amplified products using the appropriate
detection system (e.g., real-time PCR instrument).
2. Result Validation:
◦ Ensure that control results fall within predetermined ranges.
◦ Review and validate the assay results as per established
criteria.
9. Quality Control:
• Run positive and negative controls with each batch of specimens.
• Review quality control data before releasing patient results.
• Document all quality control results and any corrective actions
taken in case of failures.
• Perform routine maintenance and calibration of instruments
according to manufacturer specifications.
10. REPORTING RESULTS:
• Transmit validated results to the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
• Technologists must review and verify results before final reporting.
• In the case of any discrepancies, re-extract and perform PCR
amplification for confirmation.
11. CRITICAL AND UNEXPECTED RESULTS:
• Notify the requesting clinician immediately for critical results
following the laboratory’s communication policy.
• Document the notification in the LIS and patient’s medical record.
12. REFERENCES:
• Manufacturer’s instructions for nucleic acid extraction and NAAT
assay kits.
• CLIA guidelines for laboratory quality assurance and control.
13. REVISION HISTORY:
• Document all revisions with dates, changes made, and personnel
authorized.
14. CONTACT INFORMATION:
• List of key laboratory personnel and contact information.
This protocol follows current best practices and complies with the
requirements of a CLIA-certified laboratory. All personnel must
adhere strictly to this SOP to ensure the accuracy and reliability of
Chlamydia trachomatis testing results.
