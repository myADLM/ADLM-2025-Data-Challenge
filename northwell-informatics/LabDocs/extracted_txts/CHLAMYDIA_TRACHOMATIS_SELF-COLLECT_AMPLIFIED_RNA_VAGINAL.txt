Standard Operating Procedure
(SOP): Analytical Phase for
Chlamydia trachomatis, Self-
Collect, Amplified RNA, Vaginal
1. PURPOSE
To outline the steps required for the accurate and reliable analysis of
Chlamydia trachomatis using amplified RNA techniques from self-
collected vaginal specimens.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
• Designated laboratory technologists are responsible for
performing the analysis.
• Supervisors are responsible for overseeing the procedure and
ensuring it is followed accurately.
• All staff are responsible for identifying and reporting any
deviations in the procedure.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENT
• Accepted: Self-collected vaginal swab specimens submitted in
appropriate transport media.
• Unaccepted: Specimens that are expired, incorrectly labeled, or
show signs of contamination or damage.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND
SUPPLIES
• Automated nucleic acid extractor (e.g., Roche cobas 4800,
Hologic Panther)
• Real-time PCR instrument (e.g., Roche cobas z 480, Hologic
Panther)
• Chlamydia trachomatis assay reagents and consumables
• Disposable gloves, lab coats, and safety goggles
• Specimen transport media
• Pipettes and filter tips
• Vortex mixer
• Centrifuge (if required)
5. PROCEDURE
A) Sample Preparation
1. Receipt and Accessioning:
◦ Verify that the specimen has been properly collected,
labeled, and transported.
◦ Accession the sample into the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
2. Inspection:
◦ Check the sample for proper labeling and ensure there is no
sign of leakage or contamination.
3. Sample Preparation:
◦ Vortex the specimen collection tube vigorously for 10-15
seconds to ensure the sample is homogenized.
◦ Using a pipette with a filter tip, transfer the required volume
of the sample (as per the assay kit instructions) into a fresh,
labeled microcentrifuge tube or appropriate plate/well for
nucleic acid extraction.
B) Nucleic Acid Extraction
1. Loading Samples:
◦ Load the prepared samples along with appropriate controls
(positive and negative controls) onto the nucleic acid
extractor following manufacturer’s protocols.
2. Initiating Run:
◦ Begin the extraction run as per the equipment’s manual.
Care should be taken to prevent cross-contamination.
C) Amplification and Detection
1. PCR Setup:
◦ Once the nucleic acid extraction is complete, prepare the
PCR amplification mix according to the assay kit
instructions.
◦ Aliquot the amplification mix into the PCR plate or
designated wells, ensuring that each sample and control are
correctly added to the corresponding well.
2. Loading Real-Time PCR Instrument:
◦ Load the PCR plate into the real-time PCR instrument.
◦ Program the instrument according to the assay’s
thermocycling conditions outlined in the kit manual.
3. Running PCR:
◦ Start the run, ensuring that all relevant parameters (such as
fluorescence detection and cycling conditions) are correctly
set.
D) Result Interpretation
1. Reviewing Data:
◦ Upon completion of the amplification run, review the
amplification plots and cycle threshold (Ct) values to
determine the presence or absence of Chlamydia
trachomatis RNA in each specimen.
◦ Positive results will show amplification curves with Ct values
falling within the acceptable range defined by the assay
protocol.
2. Quality Control:
◦ Ensure that all controls (positive and negative) fall within the
expected Ct ranges and that no contamination or assay
failure has occurred.
◦ If any controls fall outside the acceptable range, the run
must be deemed invalid, and samples retested.
E) Reporting Results
1. Documentation:
◦ Document all raw and calculated data in the LIS or
laboratory records.
◦ Verify and validate results according to laboratory
standards.
2. Result Entry:
◦ Enter the final interpretation (Positive/Negative/Invalid) for
each sample into the LIS.
◦ Ensure that any critical results or concerns are
communicated to the relevant healthcare provider in a timely
manner following the laboratory’s critical result policy.
F) Waste Disposal
1. Biohazard Waste:
◦ Dispose of all biological waste, including used tips, tubes,
and gloves, in biohazard bags/containers.
2. Chemical Waste:
◦ Dispose of any chemical reagents as per the manufacturer’s
recommendations and local regulations.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include positive, negative, and blank controls in each batch of
samples tested.
• Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for quality control
frequency and acceptable control ranges.
• Document all quality control results and take corrective actions if
any QC results are out of acceptable ranges.
7. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions for the nucleic acid extraction and
real-time PCR kits.
• Laboratory’s quality control and safety manuals.
• Current Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines
for molecular diagnostics.
By following these procedures, laboratory personnel can ensure
accurate, reliable, and timely analysis of Chlamydia trachomatis from
self-collected vaginal specimens.

modifications may be necessary based on specific laboratory setups
and equipment used.
