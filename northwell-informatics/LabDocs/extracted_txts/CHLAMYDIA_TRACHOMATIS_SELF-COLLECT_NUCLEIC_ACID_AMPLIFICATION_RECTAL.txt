PROTOCOL FOR ANALYSIS OF
CHLAMYDIA TRACHOMATIS,
SELF-COLLECT, NUCLEIC ACID
AMPLIFICATION, RECTAL
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standard operating procedure for the detection of
Chlamydia trachomatis in rectal swab samples collected by patients,
using nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs). This ensures accurate,
reliable, and timely results for diagnosing infection.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing and
documenting the procedures outlined below. It is the responsibility of
all staff to follow this protocol to ensure consistency and accuracy of
results.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen
• Type: Rectal swab
• Collection: Self-collected by patients using a provided collection
kit.
Acceptable Specimen Criteria
• Specimen received in the laboratory within the specified time
frame and properly labeled.
• No visible contamination or leakage from the collection tube.
• Properly closed and intact tube seal.
4. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• Nucleic Acid Amplification Test (NAAT) kit for Chlamydia
trachomatis
• Sample collection kit including collection tube and swab (provided
to the patient)
• Specimen transport medium
• Pipettes and filtered tips
• Nuclease-free water
• Positive and negative control materials
• Laboratory safety equipment (gloves, lab coat, eye protection)
5. EQUIPMENT
• Real-time PCR machine or equivalent NAAT analyzer
• Microcentrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Biosafety cabinet
6. PROCEDURE
Specimen Receiving and Processing
1. Upon receiving the specimen, verify patient information,
collection time, and proper labeling.
2. Inspect the specimen for integrity. Document any issues and, if
necessary, contact the appropriate personnel.
3. Record the specimen in the laboratory log, noting receipt time
and condition.
Nucleic Acid Extraction
1. Place the specimen collection tube in the biosafety cabinet.
2. Mix the specimen thoroughly using a vortex mixer.
3. Pipette the required volume of the specimen into a clean,
properly labeled microcentrifuge tube.
4. Add the appropriate volume of nucleic acid extraction reagent
to the specimen tube as per the manufacturer's instructions.
5. Vortex briefly, then incubate at the specified temperature and
duration (refer to kit insert).
PCR/NAAT Setup
1. Prepare the PCR/NAAT reaction mix according to the kit
instructions. This includes the master mix, primers, probes,
nucleotides, and polymerase.
2. Aliquot the required volume of the reaction mix into each PCR
tube or well of a PCR plate.
3. Add the extracted nucleic acid sample to the PCR tubes or
wells. Avoid cross-contamination by using pipette tips with filters
and changing tips between samples.
4. Include positive and negative controls in each run.
5. Seal the PCR tubes or plate and centrifuge briefly to collect the
contents at the bottom.
Amplification and Detection
1. Load the PCR tubes or plate into the real-time PCR machine or
NAAT analyzer.
2. Run the PCR program according to the kit instructions. Ensure
proper settings for denaturation, annealing, extension, and hold
temperatures, as well as the number of cycles.
3. Upon completion, review the amplification curves and other
output parameters to determine the presence or absence of
Chlamydia trachomatis nucleic acid in the samples.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run positive and negative controls with each batch of samples to
verify assay performance.
• For abnormal control results:
◦ Review and ensure correct preparation of reagents and
controls.
◦ Verify proper operation of equipment.
◦ Repeat the run if necessary and document corrective actions.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Acceptance criteria: Results are valid if the controls are within the
expected range.
• Interpretation:
◦ Positive: Detected amplification of Chlamydia trachomatis
DNA.
◦ Negative: No amplification detected.
◦ Inconclusive: Technical issues or inhibition, repeat the test or
contact a supervisor.
Review and Verification
• Verify the results in the laboratory information system (LIS).
• Confirm critical findings with a second technologist.
9. LIMITATIONS
• Assay performance may be affected by the presence of inhibitors
in the specimen.
• Proper specimen collection, storage, and transport are crucial for
accurate results.
• False positive/negative results can occur due to technical errors
or sample contamination.
10. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's instructions for the specific NAAT kit used.
• Laboratory safety guidelines and procedures.
• Relevant internal procedural documentation and logs.
This protocol should be reviewed regularly and updated as necessary
to accommodate new technologies or procedural changes. Ensure
that all laboratory personnel are trained and competent in performing
these procedures accurately and efficiently.
