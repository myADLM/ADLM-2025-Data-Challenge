Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Chlamydia trachomatis
Detection in Self-Collected Throat Samples using Nucleic Acid
Amplification (NAAT)
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized protocol for the detection of Chlamydia
trachomatis in self-collected throat swab samples using Nucleic Acid
Amplification Testing (NAAT). This procedure ensures accurate,
reliable, and reproducible results by adherence to established
laboratory practices.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing
testing procedures and documenting results according to this
protocol. Laboratory supervisors are responsible for ensuring
adherence to this protocol and for resolving any issues that arise
during testing.
1. SPECIMEN
• Preferred/acceptable: Self-collected throat swabs in appropriate
transport medium (e.g., Universal Transport Medium, UTM).
• Unacceptable: Dry swabs, swabs in expired/incorrect transport
media, or swabs not labeled/unaccompanied by requisition
information.
1. EQUIPMENT, SUPPLIES, AND REAGENTS
• Nucleic Acid Amplification Test (NAAT) system (e.g., GeneXpert,
Aptima, Cepheid, etc.)
• NAAT reagents specific for Chlamydia trachomatis
• Calibrated micropipettes and tips
• Vortex mixer
• Centrifuge
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
• Throat swab specimens in transport medium
• Timer
1. PROCEDURE
Specimen Preparation:
1. Verify that specimen meets acceptable criteria (correct labeling,
transport medium, etc.).
2. Mix the specimen in the transport medium by vortexing for 15
seconds.
3. If required by specific NAAT system, centrifuge the specimen as
needed to concentrate the cellular material.
Nucleic Acid Extraction:
1. Follow the NAAT system manufacturer's instructions for
preparing the NAAT reagents.
2. Using a calibrated micropipette, transfer the required volume of
the specimen to the extraction reagents.
3. Vortex the mixture for 10 seconds.
4. If necessary, incubate the mixture at the specified temperature
for the specified duration as per the manufacturer's protocol.
Amplification and Detection:
1. Transfer the extracted nucleic acids to the NAAT system’s
reaction module/cartridge according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
2. Place the reaction module/cartridge into the NAAT instrument.
3. Initiate the nucleic acid amplification cycle by selecting the
appropriate test parameters for Chlamydia trachomatis.
4. Allow the NAAT instrument to complete the process of
amplification and detection of target nucleic acid sequences.
5. Monitoring should follow the NAAT instrument's visual or
auditory alerts to ensure completion without interruptions or
errors.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
Internal Quality Control:
1. Run positive and negative control specimens with each batch of
patient specimens to ensure the proper functioning of the test
system.
2. Document the results of the control specimens in the laboratory
logbook.
3. If controls fail to yield expected results, do not report patient
results. Investigate and resolve the issue according to the
troubleshooting guide provided by the manufacturer.
External Quality Control:
1. Participate in proficiency testing programs twice every year and
compare results with previous cycles and peer laboratories.
2. Document and report any discrepancies or non-conformances
to the laboratory supervisor.
3. REPORTING RESULTS
4. Review NAAT system printouts or electronic reports for positive
or negative detection of Chlamydia trachomatis.
5. Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS) or
the appropriate reporting platform. Document any test
irregularities or invalid results.
6. Positive results must be communicated to the requesting
clinician promptly as per laboratory policy.
7. For invalid results, re-assay the specimen or notify the clinician
to collect a new sample.
8. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Chlamydia trachomatis: Detected/Not detected
1. LIMITATIONS
• Improper specimen collection, handling, or transport may result in
false-negative or inconclusive results.
• Cross-contamination between specimens can lead to false-
positive results.
• Refer to the NAAT system manufacturer's insert for additional
limitations specific to the nucleic acid amplification assay.
1. SAFETY AND WASTE DISPOSAL
2. Use appropriate PPE when handling specimens and performing
testing.
3. Decontaminate work surfaces and equipment after use with
appropriate disinfectant.
4. Dispose of all biohazardous waste, including used reaction
modules/cartridges and specimen tubes, according to
established laboratory biohazard waste disposal procedures.
