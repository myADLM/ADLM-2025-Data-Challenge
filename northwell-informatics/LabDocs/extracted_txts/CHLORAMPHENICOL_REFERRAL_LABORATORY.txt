Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Chloramphenicol Referral Laboratory
1. PURPOSE
To provide a detailed and standardized approach for the analysis and
reporting of chloramphenicol levels in referral samples received in the
laboratory. This SOP outlines the procedures for sample preparation,
testing, quality control, and result reporting, ensuring accurate and
reliable data for clinical decision-making.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing
chloramphenicol analysis, adhering to the procedures outlined in this
SOP, and documenting all relevant data. Supervisors are responsible
for ensuring compliance with the SOP and taking corrective actions
when necessary.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Preferred/acceptable:
• Serum or plasma collected in a plain red-top tube or a lithium
heparin green-top tube.
• Ensure specimen stability by storing at 2-8°C and analyzing within
72 hours of collection.
Unacceptable:
• Specimens collected in tubes containing anticoagulants other
than lithium heparin (e.g., EDTA, sodium citrate).
• Specimens received in the laboratory more than 72 hours after
collection.
• Specimens with significant hemolysis or those that have not been
adequately mixed.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) system.
• Chloramphenicol Calibration Standards.
• Internal Standard for HPLC.
• Sample Preparation Kits.
• Quality Control Material – High and Low concentration controls.
• HPLC-grade solvents (e.g., acetonitrile, methanol).
• Mobile Phase components (e.g., phosphate buffer).
• Laboratory documentation tools (e.g., Temperature Monitoring
Log).
1. PROCEDURE
A) Sample Preparation:
1. Centrifuge blood samples at 3,000 rpm for 10 minutes to
separate serum/plasma.
2. Transfer the supernatant to a labelled centrifuge tube.
3. Prepare samples according to the sample preparation kit
instructions, ensuring complete extraction of chloramphenicol.
4. Store prepared samples at 2-8°C until ready for analysis.
B) HPLC Setup and Calibration:
1. Switch on the HPLC system and ensure all components are
functioning correctly.
2. Prepare mobile phase according to the specified composition
for chloramphenicol analysis.
3. Calibrate the HPLC using chloramphenicol calibration
standards. Inject standards and record their retention times and
peak areas.
4. Plot calibration curve and calculate the response factor.
C) Analytical Testing:
1. Load prepared samples onto the HPLC system according to the
set sequence.
2. Inject samples and monitor chromatograms.
3. Identify chloramphenicol peaks and record their retention times
and peak areas.
4. Compare sample peaks with calibration standards to quantify
chloramphenicol levels.
D) Quality Control:
1. Analyze quality control samples (High and Low concentration
controls) alongside patient samples.
2. Document QC results and ensure they fall within acceptable
limits.
3. If QC results are outside acceptable limits, troubleshoot and
repeat the analysis before releasing patient results.
4. REPORTING RESULTS
5. Transmit results automatically to the Laboratory Information
System (LIS) for review and verification.
6. Review chromatograms and ensure integrity and validity of
results.
7. Verify and sign off on results, ensuring all documentation is
complete.
8. Report results according to site-specific guidelines, including
necessary comments for any observed interference or
anomalies.
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the HPLC system’s user manual and chloramphenicol
reagent insert for specific limitations and potential interferences.
1. CORRECTIVE ACTIONS
2. If any equipment malfunction or deviation from expected results
is observed, notify the supervisor immediately.
3. Follow troubleshooting guidelines outlined in the HPLC user
manual.
4. Document any corrective actions taken in the laboratory log.
