Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Chlordiazepoxide and Metabolite, Serum
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the procedures for the qualitative and quantitative
analysis of chlordiazepoxide and its metabolite in serum samples.
This includes steps for proper sample preparation, instrument
calibration, analysis, quality control, and reporting of results.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory staff are responsible for following the
procedures as defined in this SOP.
• Laboratory supervisors are responsible for ensuring that staff are
trained and that monitoring and documentation are properly
maintained.
• Staff must identify and report any issues affecting the analysis to
the supervisor immediately.
1. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all serum samples submitted to the laboratory for
the analysis of chlordiazepoxide and its metabolite.
1. SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS
• All laboratory personnel must adhere to general laboratory safety
protocols.
• Use personal protective equipment (PPE) including laboratory
coat, gloves, and safety glasses when handling samples and
reagents.
• Waste disposal must comply with biohazard and chemical waste
protocols.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Serum
• Collection Tubes: Red-top tube (no anticoagulant) or serum
separator tube (SST)
• Volume Required: At least 2 mL of serum
• Storage: Refrigerate at 2-8°C if analysis is performed within 24
hours; otherwise, freeze at -20°C for longer storage.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) system or Gas
Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) system
• Analytical balance
• Vortex mixer
• Centrifuge
• Chlordiazepoxide and metabolite certified reference materials
• Calibrators and controls
• Solvents and reagents including methanol, acetonitrile, water
(HPLC grade), and internal standard (such as diazepam)
1. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation
1. Allow frozen serum samples to thaw at room temperature.
2. Centrifuge samples at 2000-3000 x g for 10 minutes to
separate serum from fibrin and other particulates.
3. Pipette 1 mL of serum into a clean microcentrifuge tube.
4. Add 100 µL of internal standard solution to each tube.
5. Vortex mix for 30 seconds.
B. Calibrator and Quality Controls Preparation
1. Prepare calibrators at different concentrations (low, medium,
and high) by spiking blank serum with certified reference
materials for chlordiazepoxide and its metabolite.
2. Prepare QC samples at low, medium, and high concentrations
similar to those of the calibrators.
C. Sample Extraction
1. Add 2 mL of acetonitrile to each serum sample, calibrator, and
QC.
2. Vortex mix for 1 minute.
3. Centrifuge at 12000 x g for 10 minutes.
4. Transfer the supernatant to a clean test tube and evaporate to
dryness under nitrogen at 40°C.
5. Reconstitute the residue in 100 µL of mobile phase (e.g., 50:50
methanol:water).
D. Instrument Calibration and Analysis
1. Calibrate the HPLC/GC-MS system according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
2. Inject calibrators to generate a calibration curve.
3. Analyze QC samples to ensure system performance.
4. Inject serum samples onto the HPLC or GC-MS system for
analysis.
5. Record and analyze chromatograms to identify and quantify
chlordiazepoxide and its metabolite concentrations.
E. Quality Control
1. Perform analysis of QC samples along with each batch of
patient samples to ensure accuracy and precision.
2. Review and document QC results to ensure they are within
acceptable limits.
3. If QC results are outside of acceptable limits, recalibrate the
instrument and reanalyze affected samples.
4. REPORTING RESULTS
5. Results are automatically transmitted to the Laboratory
Information System (LIS) for review.
6. Technologists review and verify results before release.
7. Any results falling outside reference ranges or showing
significant deviations must be flagged and reanalyzed.
8. Critical results must be promptly communicated to the
appropriate healthcare provider following established protocols.
9. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Reference intervals are to be established based on validated
literature values or institutional studies.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the instrument’s user manual for potential limitations
associated with the HPLC/GC-MS analysis of chlordiazepoxide and
its metabolites, including sensitivity to matrix effects and potential
interferences from other substances in the serum.
