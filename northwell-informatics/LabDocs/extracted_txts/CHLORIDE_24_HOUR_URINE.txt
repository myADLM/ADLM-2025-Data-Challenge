SOP: Analytical Procedure for Generating Results for Chloride,
24 Hour, Urine
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the standardized analytical procedure for
measuring Chloride levels in a 24-hour urine specimen. It ensures
accurate and consistent results are generated for patient diagnosis
and treatment.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for following the outlined
procedures and ensuring correct documentation throughout the
analytical phase.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/acceptable:
• 24-hour urine specimen collected in a provided urine collection
container.
• Specimen should be sent to the laboratory immediately after the
collection period is completed.
Unacceptable:
• Specimens arriving in the laboratory more than 24 hours after the
end of the collection period.
• Specimens with no collection start/end date and time indicated on
the container or requisition.
• Discard specimens that were improperly stored or show signs of
contamination.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Urine collection container
• Automated urine chemistry analyzer or ion-selective electrode
analyzer
• Calibration standards, controls, and reagents specific for chloride
• Pipettes, sample cups, and other necessary labware
1. PROCEDURE
A) Verification of Specimen:
1. Upon receipt, verify the specimen is properly labeled with
collection start/end dates and times.
2. Ensure the specimen volume is adequate for analysis and
appears free of contamination.
B) Sample Preparation:
1. Mix the urine specimen well to ensure homogeneity.
2. Examine specimen visually for particulate matter; if present,
centrifuge the sample at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes and decant
the supernatant.
3. Prepare aliquots according to analyzer requirements.
C) Calibration and Quality Control:
1. Perform calibration of the urine chemistry analyzer using
manufacturer-specified standards.
2. Ensure quality control checks are within acceptable limits, using
two levels of QC material (normal and abnormal) before sample
analysis.
D) Measurement:
1. Load the prepared urine specimen onto the analyzer.
2. Run the sample according to the instrument’s protocol for
chloride measurement.
3. Document the date, time, operator initials, and any
observations during the analysis on the Analysis Log.
E) Troubleshooting:
1. If results fall outside expected ranges, check the instrument for
calibration and QC status.
2. Re-run the control materials; if they are out of range, recalibrate
the instrument.
3. Repeat the analysis on a fresh aliquot if necessary.
4. Document corrective actions taken in the Analysis Log.
F) Reporting Results:
1. Review results generated by the analyzer.
2. Verify results match expected unit measurements and are
within the instrument's reportable range.
3. Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS) for
review and final verification.
4. If QC was passed and results verified, dispatch patient results
to appropriate medical staff.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
• Ensure all QC materials are stored and handled according to
manufacturer specifications (typically 2-8oC). Aliquots for QC are
stable for up to 30 days at room temperature.
• Perform QC checks every shift or batch of samples analyzed.
• Document all QC results and ensure they are within acceptable
limits provided by the QC material manufacturers.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Reference intervals for urine chloride are based on established
laboratory norms:
• Normal Range: 110 - 250 mmol/day
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Results can be affected by improper specimen collection,
transport, or storage conditions.
• Refer to manufacturer’s insert for analyzer-specific limitations.
1. REVIEW AND VERIFICATION
• Every technologist is responsible for ensuring the accuracy and
precision of results.
• Supervisors review results and any corrective actions taken for
non-compliant results.
References:
• Analyzer manufacturer’s procedures and package inserts
• Clinical guidelines for urine chloride measurement
1. REVISION HISTORY
• Record of all modifications to the procedure with reason and date.
By following this SOP, laboratory personnel will ensure that Chloride
levels in 24-hour urine specimens are measured accurately, reliably,
and consistently, supporting clinical decision-making and patient
care.
