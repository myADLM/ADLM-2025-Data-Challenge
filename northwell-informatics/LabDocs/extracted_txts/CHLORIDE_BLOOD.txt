Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) - Analysis of Chloride in
Blood Specimens
1. Purpose The purpose of this SOP is to ensure accurate and
reliable analysis and reporting of blood chloride levels using
standardized methods in the laboratory.
Responsibility Designated laboratory staff are responsible for
performing the analysis, recording results, and ensuring quality
control measures are met. It is also the responsibility of laboratory
supervisors to ensure staff adhere to the procedures outlined in this
document.
1. Specimen Requirements and Stability
• Acceptable Specimens:
◦ Whole blood collected in lithium heparin tubes (preferred)
◦ Serum collected in serum separator tubes (SST)
◦ Plasma collected in heparinized vacutainers (dark green or
PST)
• Unacceptable Specimens:
◦ Specimens with significant hemolysis
◦ Specimens in anticoagulants like EDTA or citrate
◦ Specimens received more than 48 hours after collection
unless stored at 2-8°C
1. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies
• Automated biochemical analyzer (e.g., Roche or equivalent)
• Electrode specific for chloride ion analysis or appropriate reagents
for the analyzer being used
• Quality control materials for chloride
• Calibrators
• Labelled specimen tubes
1. Procedure
A. Preparation:
◦ Check and ensure that all reagents, calibrators, and controls
are within the expiry date.
◦ Prepare controls and calibrators according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Confirm that the analyzer is properly calibrated for chloride
analysis.
B. Analysis:
◦ Ensure specimens are properly labelled and logged into the
Laboratory Information System (LIS).
◦ Inspect specimens for any hemolysis or other interferences.
Discard any unacceptable specimens following protocols.
◦ Load specimens, controls, and calibrators into the analyzer
according to the manufacturer’s guidelines.
◦ Run the chloride tests on the specimens using the analyzer.
Follow manufacturer’s operating instructions closely.
C. Quality Control:
◦ Run quality control materials at the start of each shift,
following any major maintenance, and in accordance with
laboratory policy.
◦ Document quality control results in the QC log.
◦ If control results are outside the acceptable range,
troubleshoot and resolve issues before proceeding with
patient specimen analysis.
2. Target Reference Ranges
• Typical adult reference range for serum/plasma chloride: 98-106
mmol/L (Note: Reference ranges may vary depending on the
analyzer and local population. Always refer to specific lab
guidelines.)
1. Reporting Results
• Verify results from the analyzer before releasing to the LIS.
• Ensure that critical values (e.g., chloride levels below 85 mmol/L
or above 115 mmol/L) are immediately reviewed and acted upon
as per laboratory critical values policy.
• Document any discretion used during result validation and note
any potential interferences observed.
1. Documentation and Record Keeping
• Maintain a log of all maintenance, calibrations, and quality control
activities.
• Record any deviations from standard procedure and the
corresponding corrective actions taken.
• Store all data in accordance with laboratory data management
policies, ensuring proper backup and confidentiality.
1. Method Limitations
• Ensure awareness of potential interferences such as high levels
of other ions or strong oxidizing substances.
• Consult the analyzer's instruction manual for any analyte-specific
limitations or performance characteristics.
1. References
• Manufacturer’s manual and product inserts for the specific
biochemical analyzer and reagents used.
• Laboratory Quality Control and Safety Guidelines documents.
• Reference texts such as “Tietz Textbook of Clinical Chemistry and
Molecular Diagnostics” for additional context on chloride analysis
methods.

Note: The above protocol is intended to standardize the procedure
for chloride analysis in blood specimens within the laboratory. Strict
adherence to procedures and comprehensive documentation are
essential for ensuring high accuracy and reliability in test results.
