Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Chloride in Feces
1. PURPOSE
This SOP provides a detailed procedure for analyzing chloride
concentration in fecal specimens, ensuring accurate and reliable
results. It outlines the methodology, necessary reagents, equipment,
quality control, and reporting processes.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing,
documenting, and reviewing the results of chloride analysis as
defined in this procedure. Supervisors must ensure that all processes
comply with regulatory standards and maintain the integrity of results.
1. DEFINITION
Chloride in feces is analyzed to diagnose and manage various
gastrointestinal disorders. Quantifying fecal chloride helps in the
diagnosis of conditions such as secretory diarrhea and cystic fibrosis.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/Acceptable:
• 5-10 grams of fresh feces collected in a clean, dry, leak-proof
container.
• Specimens must be transported to the laboratory within 2 hours of
collection.
• If there is any delay in transportation, keep the specimen
refrigerated (2-8°C) and deliver it to the laboratory within 24
hours.
Unacceptable:
• Specimens received in non-sterile or leaking containers.
• Specimens received more than 24 hours after collection without
refrigeration.
• Specimens containing an insufficient quantity of feces.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Analytical balance
• Centrifuge
• Volumetric flasks and pipettes
• Chloride reagent kit (as per manufacturer’s instructions)
• Water bath/incubator (if required for analysis)
• Refrigeration storage for specimens
• Quality control materials (with known chloride concentration
values)
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation of Specimen:
1. Wear appropriate PPE, including gloves, lab coat, and eye
protection.
2. Homogenize the fecal specimen to ensure uniform consistency.
3. Weigh an aliquot (approximately 1 gram) of the homogenized
feces using an analytical balance.
B. Extraction:
1. Add a specified volume of distilled water to the weighed fecal
sample to dilute it (typically a 1:5 or 1:10 dilution is used).
2. Mix thoroughly to ensure complete suspension.
3. Centrifuge the suspension at 2000 g for 10 minutes to separate
the undissolved particles.
4. Carefully decant the supernatant without disturbing the pellet.
C. Analysis:
1. Pipette an aliquot of the supernatant into a clean test tube.
2. Add the chloride reagent as specified by the manufacturer.
3. Mix and incubate according to the reagent kit instructions.
4. Read the chloride concentration using a suitable photometer or
ion-selective electrode, as per the manufacturer’s direction.
D. Quality Control:
1. Run quality control samples (both high and low chloride
concentration) concurrently with patient samples.
2. Confirm that quality control results fall within the manufacturer’s
acceptable range before proceeding to patient sample analysis.
E. Reporting Results:
1. Document the chloride concentration in mmol/L.
2. Ensure that results are reviewed and verified by a technologist.
3. Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS) for
reporting to the ordering physician.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
Refer to site-specific guidelines for reporting results.
• Record the final chloride concentration (in mmol/L) in the LIS.
• If the result falls outside the reference intervals, follow the facility’s
protocol for critical values and notify the relevant healthcare
provider promptly.
7. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Reference ranges may vary based on patient demographics and
clinical context. Refer to the laboratory's reference interval chart for
appropriate values.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Ensure complete homogenization of the fecal sample to achieve
accurate results.
• Avoid contamination of specimens and reagents to prevent false
results.
• Follow the manufacturer’s instructions meticulously for reliable
outcomes.
9. STORAGE AND STABILITY
• Store reagents and quality control materials at the recommended
temperatures (refer to manufacturer’s instructions).
• Store fecal specimens at 2-8°C if analysis is not performed
immediately, but analyze within 24 hours of collection.
10. REFERENCES
Include references to the reagent kit's product insert, relevant
literature, and applicable clinical guidelines.

List the contact details for technical support, including names, phone
numbers, and email addresses of responsible personnel.
