Protocol for the Analytical Phase of Generating Results for
CHLORIDE, PLASMA
1. PURPOSE: The purpose of this SOP is to provide a standardized
procedure for the analysis of plasma chloride levels in order to
ensure accuracy, reliability, and consistency of results.
2. SCOPE: This procedure applies to the determination of chloride in
plasma samples within the clinical laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITIES:
• Laboratory Technologist: Responsible for performing the
analysis of plasma chloride levels according to this SOP and for
documenting all results and actions taken.
• Laboratory Supervisor: Responsible for overseeing the
implementation of this SOP, providing guidance as required, and
ensuring compliance with regulatory and accreditation standards.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS:
• Specimen Type: Plasma
• Collection Tube: Lithium heparin (green top) tube
• Volume: At least 1 mL of plasma
• Handling: Specimens should be collected, handled, and stored
following the institution's guidelines to maintain the integrity and
stability of the sample. Specimens should be centrifuged promptly
to separate plasma from cells.
• Storage: Plasma samples should be stored at 2-8°C if analysis is
not performed immediately and are stable for up to 48 hours
under these conditions.
5. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS:
• Analyzer: Select an approved clinical chemistry analyzer capable
of measuring plasma chloride levels.
• Reagents: Approved chloride reagents specific for the analyzer in
use.
• Calibration Standards: Certified standard solutions for chloride
calibration.
• Quality Control (QC) Material: Two levels of control materials
(normal and abnormal ranges).
• Other Supplies: Pipettes, centrifuge, sample cups, gloves, lab
coat, timer, paper towels.
6. PROCEDURE: 6.1 Pre-Analytical Phase:
• Verify specimen integrity: Ensure that the specimen is free from
hemolysis, clotting, or other signs of contamination.
• Refer to the laboratory Information System (LIS) to confirm patient
information and test orders.
• Label sample cups with the appropriate patient identifiers and test
requisition number.
6.2 Calibration:
• Perform calibration of the analyzer using certified standard
solutions according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
• Document calibration results, ensuring they fall within acceptable
ranges.
6.3 Quality Control:
• Run QC materials at both levels (normal and abnormal) at the
start of each shift, after calibration, and whenever a new reagent
lot is used.
• Document the QC results in the QC log. Acceptable ranges
should be predetermined and any deviations should be
investigated.
6.4 Sample Analysis:
• Allow plasma samples and QC materials to reach room
temperature before analysis.
• Load the properly identified sample cups onto the analyzer
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
• Select the chloride test on the analyzer menu, ensuring correct
patient linkage.
• Initiate the analysis process.
6.5 Result Verification:
• Review the results generated by the analyzer for any flags or
error messages.
• Compare the patient results with QC results to ensure test run
validity.
• If QC results are out of range, troubleshoot according to the
instrument's guidelines (e.g., recalibrate, replace reagents) and
repeat the analysis as needed.
• Enter the verified results into the LIS.
7. REPORTING RESULTS: Results are automatically transmitted to
the LIS from the analyzer. The technologist reviews and verifies
results before releasing them to ensure accuracy. Documentation
should include any unusual findings or comments on sample integrity.
8. QUALITY CONTROL:
• Document and review all quality control data. Resolve any
deviations or trends immediately.
• Participate in external quality assessment schemes (proficiency
testing) to ensure accuracy and standardization with peer
laboratories.
9. REFERENCE INTERVALS:
• Typical reference interval for plasma chloride: 98-106 mmol/L.
Note: reference intervals may vary slightly depending on the
methodology and population served. Verify with your current
reference ranges.
10. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
• Hemolyzed samples can release intracellular chloride, leading to
false elevations.
• Certain drugs and conditions may interfere with chloride
measurement.
