SOP: Analytical Procedure for CHLORIDE, RANDOM, URINE
1. PURPOSE This protocol establishes the standard operating
procedure for the analysis and reporting of chloride in random
urine specimens. The aim is to ensure consistency, accuracy,
and reliability of test results.
Responsibility: All designated technical staff are responsible for
performing, documenting, and reviewing the analytical procedures.
Laboratory supervisors are responsible for ensuring compliance with
this SOP and addressing any deviations or deficiencies.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENT AND STABILITY
◦ Specimen Type: Random urine
◦ Volume: Minimum of 10 mL
◦ Storage: Fresh specimens should be analyzed as soon as
possible. If there is a delay, store urine specimens at 2-8°C
and analyze within 24 hours.
◦ Unacceptable Specimens: Specimens that are unlabelled,
not stored properly, or received in non-sterile containers.
2. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
◦ Analytical instrument: Ion-specific electrode (ISE) analyzer
or equivalent
◦ Reagents: Chloride standards and controls
◦ Supplies: Urine collection containers, pipettes, and
disposable cups
3. QUALITY CONTROL (QC)
◦ QC Frequency: Run two levels of quality control material
(low and high) at the start of each day, with each new batch
of reagent, and after every 20 patient samples.
◦ QC Materials: Use commercially available QC materials with
known chloride concentrations.
◦ Outcome: Results must fall within the defined acceptable
range. If QC fails, troubleshoot the issue and rerun QC
before proceeding with patient samples.
4. PROCEDURE
1. Preparation: a. Ensure all equipment is calibrated and
functioning according to manufacturer’s instructions. b.
Allow reagents and QC materials to come to room
temperature if refrigerated.
2. Sample Analysis: a. Mix the random urine sample
thoroughly. b. Using a pipette, aliquot the urine sample
into a disposable cup. c. Follow the manufacturer's
instructions to prepare the sample specific to the analyzer
used. d. Load the sample onto the analyzer.
3. Instrument Operation: a. Enter the patient information and
sample identification into the analyzer. b. Initiate the
analysis according to the analyzer’s operational manual.
c. The analyzer will process and measure the chloride
concentration in the urine sample.
4. Documentation and Review: a. Record the chloride
concentration in the laboratory information system (LIS).
b. Review the patient result for any flags or warnings
indicated by the analyzer. c. Compare QC and patient
sample results to ensure they are within established
parameters. d. If results are within acceptable limits,
release the result. If outside of acceptable limits,
investigate the cause, repeat analysis if necessary, and
document findings.
5. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ Report results as chloride concentration in mmol/L.
◦ Reference intervals: Reference intervals may be specific to
the patient population and should be established by the
laboratory director.
◦ Critical Values: There are no established critical values for
urine chloride; however, any value deemed clinically
significant by the technologist should be brought to the
attention of the patient's primary caregiver.
6. METHOD LIMITATIONS
◦ Hematuria, proteinuria, and extreme pH levels can interfere
with results.
◦ Very dilute or concentrated urine may necessitate dilution or
concentration adjustments for accurate measurement.
7. REFERENCES
◦ Manufacturer’s manual for the specific analytical equipment
used.
◦ CLSI guidelines for urine chloride testing.
◦ Internal laboratory guidelines and quality control
procedures.
Note: This protocol is subject to review and updates as new
equipment, reagents, and methodologies are introduced. Ensure
version control by documenting revision history.
By adhering to this SOP, the laboratory ensures consistent, accurate,
and reliable analysis of chloride in random urine specimens.
