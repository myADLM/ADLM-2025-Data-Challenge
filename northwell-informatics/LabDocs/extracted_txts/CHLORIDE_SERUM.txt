Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for CHLORIDE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedures for accurately
measuring serum chloride levels in a clinical laboratory. This process
ensures the reliability and accuracy of results provided to the
healthcare providers.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing serum
chloride measurements, adhering to quality control measures, and
documenting the results as per this SOP. Supervisors are responsible
for training staff, ensuring adherence to the protocol, and addressing
any identified deviations.
1. DEFINITION
Chloride, an electrolyte found in all body fluids, is important in
maintaining acid-base balance, transmitting nerve impulses, and
regulating fluid in and out of cells. The serum chloride test measures
the chloride level in the liquid portion of the blood.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
◦ Preferred/Acceptable Specimens: Serum obtained from a
properly collected blood sample using an SST (Serum
Separator Tube) or red-top tube.
◦ Unacceptable Specimens: Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric
samples, samples collected in anticoagulant tubes (e.g.,
EDTA, citrate, or oxalate).
2. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
◦ Automated Chemistry Analyzer (specified by the laboratory)
◦ Chloride reagent kits specific to the analyzer
◦ Calibrators and controls (3 levels: low, normal, and high)
◦ Pipettes and tips
◦ Personal protective equipment (PPE)
3. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation and Calibration
1. Daily Preparation:
◦ Turn on the Chemistry Analyzer and ensure it performs self-
diagnosis.
◦ Load and prime the instrument with chloride reagent
according to manufacturer instructions.
◦ Prepare calibrators and controls at room temperature.
2. Calibration:
◦ Calibrate the analyzer using recommended calibrators
before any patient testing.
◦ Verify calibration once per day or when new reagent lots are
used.
B. Quality Control
1. Run Quality Controls:
◦ Run low, normal, and high control levels at the start of each
shift.
◦ Document the QC results. Ensure they fall within acceptable
ranges provided by the manufacturer.
◦ If control results are out of range, troubleshoot according to
the manufacturer's guidelines, recalibrate, and re-run QC.
C. Sample Handling and Analysis
1. Sample Preparation:
◦ Centrifuge collected blood samples at 3000 RPM for 10
minutes to obtain serum.
◦ Ensure the serum is clear and free from hemolysis or
particulate matter.
2. Sample Analysis:
◦ Load samples onto the Chemistry Analyzer according to
manufacturer instructions.
◦ Enter patient information and sample identification into the
analyzer's LIS.
◦ Select the appropriate test panel including chloride
measurement.
◦ Start the analysis run and ensure the analyzer completes
the cycle without errors.
D. Result Reporting:
1. Review Results:
◦ Review the generated results for any flags or error codes.
◦ Re-run the sample if the analyzer flags any errors or out-of-
range results.
2. Data Entry:
◦ Manually or automatically transmit results to the Laboratory
Information System (LIS) for verification.
◦ Review and verify results in the LIS before releasing.
3. Critical Results:
◦ If critical chloride values are detected (typically <98 mmol/L
or >107 mmol/L, adjust as per laboratory-specific criteria),
promptly notify the attending healthcare provider following
the lab’s critical result notification policy.
4. METHOD LIMITATIONS
◦ Hemolysis, lipemic, or icteric samples may interfere with the
assay and produce inaccurate results.
◦ Ensure no contact of serum with air bubbles to avoid false
readings.
5. REFERENCE INTERVALS
◦ Typical Adult Reference Range: 98-107 mmol/L. Specific
reference ranges may vary slightly based on instrumentation
and population served.
