Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for CHLORIDE, URINE, 24 HOUR
1. PURPOSE
This SOP provides detailed instructions for the analytical phase of
testing and generating results for CHLORIDE in a 24-hour urine
specimen. It ensures accuracy, consistency, and reliability of test
results in compliance with CLIA standards.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel conducting urine
chloride analysis.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• All laboratory personnel performing the test.
• Supervisory staff to ensure compliance and troubleshooting.
• Quality control personnel to validate tests.
4. DEFINITIONS
• Urine Chloride: Analyte measuring the concentration of chloride
ions in urine.
• 24-hour Urine Collection: A complete collection of urine output
for 24 hours for diagnostic testing.
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: 24-hour urine.
• Container: Clean, leak-proof 24-hour urine collection container
without preservatives.
• Volume: Ensure the total volume collected is measured and
recorded.
6. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Automated Chemistry Analyzer (e.g., Roche Cobas, Beckman
Coulter AU).
• Chloride standard/reference material.
• Quality control materials (high and low controls).
• Disposable pipettes and tubes.
• Sample cups.
• Deionized water for dilution.
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) as per laboratory safety
protocols.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run two levels of quality control (QC) materials at the start of
each shift, with any new reagent lot, and after performing
maintenance or troubleshooting.
• Document all QC results in the QC log.
• Results falling outside acceptable control limits require
investigation and resolution before proceeding with patient
sample analysis.
8. PROCEDURE
A) Sample Preparation
1. Mix the 24-hour urine sample thoroughly.
2. Record the total volume of the 24-hour urine sample.
3. Aliquot an appropriate volume (based on analyzer
requirements) into a sample cup.
B) Analyzer Preparation
1. Turn on and calibrate the chemistry analyzer according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
2. Load the chloride standard/reference material and QC materials
into the analyzer.
3. Verify the calibration with the chloride standard.
C) Analysis
1. Place the aliquoted urine sample on the sample rack or
carousel.
2. Program the analyzer for CL (chloride) analysis.
3. Initiate the analysis sequence on the analyzer.
4. Ensure all necessary information (e.g., patient ID, total urine
volume) is entered into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
D) Result Validation
1. Review analyzer output for the chloride concentration in the 24-
hour urine sample.
2. Multiply the chloride concentration by the total volume (in liters)
of the 24-hour urine collection to calculate total chloride
excretion.
Example Calculation:
Total Chloride (mmol/day) = Chloride concentration (mmol/L) × Total urine volume (L)
3. Document the final result in the LIS.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
• Verify and validate results in the LIS.
• Ensure reference intervals for urine chloride are applied according
to the laboratory's standard reporting guidelines.
• Inform the requesting physician of critical results according to the
laboratory's critical value communication protocol.
10. REFERENCE INTERVAL
• Refer to the established reference intervals for urine chloride
provided in the LIS or laboratory manual.
11. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Ensure accurate 24-hour urine collection as incomplete collection
could affect results.
• Hemolysis, contamination, or improper specimen handling can
lead to erroneous results.
12. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's instructions for use of the chemistry analyzer.
• Current laboratory technical manual.
• CLIA guidelines for urine electrolyte testing.
13. REVIEW AND REVISION
• SOP will be reviewed annually or whenever there is a change in
equipment, reagents, or standards.
• Any revisions must be approved by the laboratory director.
