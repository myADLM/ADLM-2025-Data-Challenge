Standard Operating Procedure: Analytical Phase for Generating
Results for Chloride, Urine, Random
1. PURPOSE
To outline the standard operating procedures for the analysis of
random urine samples for chloride concentration using a biochemical
analyzer. This SOP ensures accurate and reliable test results,
facilitating prompt patient care and diagnosis.
1. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory staff involved in the analysis of
random urine samples for chloride concentration. The procedure
covers the preparation, analysis, quality control, and reporting of
results.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the laboratory technologists to perform the
analysis according to this SOP. Laboratory supervisors must ensure
that technologists are adequately trained and that all necessary
equipment and reagents are available and functioning correctly.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Type: Random urine sample
Preferred/Acceptable:
• Freshly voided urine sample collected in a sterile container.
• Minimum volume required: 10 mL.
• Specimen should be mixed well and labeled appropriately.
Unacceptable:
• Specimens arriving more than 24 hours after collection.
• Specimens contaminated, improperly labeled, or without
collection date/time indicated.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Biochemical Analyzer (e.g., Roche Cobas c501)
• Reagent Kits specific for chloride determination
• Calibrators and controls (e.g., Biorad Level 1 and 2 Controls)
• Pipettes and tips
• Urine containers and sampling cups
• Gloves and other PPE as required
1. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Verify that all required reagents and consumables are available,
within expiration date, and properly stored.
2. Calibrate the biochemical analyzer as per the manufacturer’s
instructions prior to use.
3. Perform instrument maintenance checks and document results.
Analysis:
1. Ensure the sample has been collected and labeled correctly.
2. Mix the urine sample thoroughly by gently inverting the
container several times.
3. Aliquot 1 mL of the urine sample into a labeled sample cup.
4. Load the sample cup into the biochemical analyzer.
5. Select the chloride test function on the analyzer.
6. Start the analysis following the instrument’s operating
instructions.
7. Review the generated results and ensure there are no error
messages or alarming QC results.
Quality Control:
1. Run quality control samples at the beginning of each shift, after
any calibration, and when a new reagent lot is opened.
2. Use Level 1 (negative) and Level 2 (positive) controls.
3. Document the results. Ensure QC results fall within the
expected range before proceeding with patient samples.
4. If QC fails, troubleshoot according to the manufacturer’s
guidelines and retest. Do not release patient results until QC
passes.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
2. Review the analyzer's printout or digital data.
3. Verify that the results are within the expected range for the
patient's condition.
4. Enter the results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
5. Flag any critical results and notify the appropriate medical
personnel immediately, following the laboratory’s policy for
critical values.
6. Release the verified results to the patient’s medical record.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Adult Reference Interval for Random Urine Chloride:
• Normal Range: 110 - 250 mmol/L
(Note: Reference intervals may vary slightly based on the specific
reagent kit and manufacturer guidelines. Always refer to the package
insert for the most accurate information.)
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolysis, contamination, or erroneous sample handling can
interfere with the results.
• Certain medications or dietary components can influence urine
chloride concentration.
Refer to the reagent kit insert for specific method limitations and
interferences.
