1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the accurate and precise
quantification of chloride in timed urine samples, ensuring the
integrity, reliability, and clinical accuracy of patient test results.
Responsibility:
Laboratory personnel are responsible for performing chloride tests on
timed urine samples according to this protocol and ensuring that all
procedures are followed as outlined. Supervisors are responsible for
ensuring that the laboratory personnel are adequately trained and
that the test results are reviewed and verified before reporting to the
clinician.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen Type:
Timed urine collection Specimen Collection: The patient must collect
all urine during a specified time period (24 hours is typical). The
patient should keep the urine specimen refrigerated throughout the
collection period. The container must be clearly labeled with the
patient’s name, the start and end dates and times of the collection
period, and the total volume. Specimen Transportation: Specimen
must be transported to the laboratory immediately after the collection
period if possible. If transportation is delayed, the collected urine
should be kept refrigerated. Specimen Stability: Once in the
laboratory, the specimen should be stored at 2-8°C and tested
promptly. The sample is stable for up to 48 hours if refrigerated. For
longer storage, aliquots may be frozen at -20°C for no longer than
one month.
Unacceptable Specimens: Specimens that are not refrigerated during
collection or transport. Incompletely collected (missed voids) or
improperly stored specimens. Specimens without clear labeling of
collection times and total volume.
1. REAGENTS AND EQUIPMENT
Reagents: Chloride reagent kit Calibrators Control material (including
both low and high chloride level controls)
Equipment: Centrifuge Automated clinical chemistry analyzer
calibrated for chloride measurement Pipettes and pipette tips
Centrifuge tubes Calibrated volumetric flasks or graduated cylinders
Personal Protective Equipment (PPE): lab coat, gloves, safety
goggles
1. QUALITY CONTROL
Quality Control Materials: Utilize commercially prepared quality
control materials at both normal and abnormal levels. Store control
materials according to manufacturer instructions. Reconstitute and
handle according to manufacturer instructions.
Quality Control Procedure: Run QC samples at the beginning of
each shift, after instrument calibration, and after any maintenance
procedures. Record QC results and ensure they fall within the
defined acceptable ranges. Investigate any out-of-range values and
repeat analysis if necessary. Document all QC activities and
corrective actions taken in a QC log.
1. CALIBRATION
Calibration Materials: Use calibrators provided with the reagent kit.
Calibration Procedure: Calibrate the analyzer according to
manufacturer instructions whenever a new lot of reagents is started,
following instrument maintenance, and at the frequency specified by
the laboratory’s quality management plan.
1. PROCEDURE
Pre-analysis: Ensure all reagents, controls, and calibrators are at
appropriate conditions and valid for use (not expired). Mix the urine
sample thoroughly to ensure homogeneity. Aliquot an appropriate
volume of the urine sample into a labeled centrifuge tube. Centrifuge
the sample at 1500-2000g for 10 minutes; this step may be skipped if
the sample is visibly clear and free of particulate matter.
Analysis: Follow the specific step-by-step instructions provided by the
manufacturer of the automated clinical chemistry analyzer for running
urine samples. Include appropriate blank, control, and standard
samples in each run to ensure accuracy. Specific steps generally
include: Placing the aliquoted sample in the sample rack or
designated input area. Initiating the analytical run via the analyzer
software. Documenting the results provided by the instrument once
the analysis completes.
Review and Verification: Compare the test results to the control
results to confirm the run validity. All results should be reviewed by a
second technologist or the laboratory supervisor for accuracy.
Investigate any flagged or questionable results per laboratory
guidelines.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
Results should be recorded promptly in the laboratory information
system (LIS). Report results as mmol/L and annotate with patient
identifier, sample collection time, and total urine volume. Critical
values should be communicated to the responsible clinician
immediately using predefined communication protocols.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Ensure corrective actions are logged if any deviations from the
standard range are noted. Refer to the reagent insert for specific
limitations of the reagent, such as potential interferences or known
analytical issues.
1. REFERENCES
Refer to the manufacturer’s package insert for detailed information
regarding reagent composition, handling, and safety information.
1. SAFETY AND HANDLING
Use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) at all times
while handling specimens and chemicals. Dispose of waste
specimens, reagents, and any other hazardous materials in
accordance with laboratory and local regulations. Review Material
Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) for all reagents and materials used.
This SOP should be reviewed and updated at least annually or
whenever new equipment, reagents, or techniques are introduced in
the laboratory.
