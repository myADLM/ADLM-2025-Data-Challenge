Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for CHLORPROMAZINE (THORAZINE)
1.PURPOSE
To outline the procedures for the analytical phase of generating
results for Chlorpromazine (Thorazine) in the clinical laboratory. This
includes specimen preparation, analysis, quality control, and result
reporting to ensure accurate and reliable test outcomes.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen Type:
• Plasma, collected in Green-top tube (sodium heparin) or
Lavender-top tube (EDTA).
Specimen Volume:
• Minimum volume: 2 mL.
Specimen Storage:
• Specimens should be stored refrigerated at 2-8°C if not analyzed
immediately.
• Specimens may be stored at -20°C for longer periods. Avoid
repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
Specimen Stability:
• At room temperature (20–25⁰C): up to 24 hours.
• Refrigerated (2-8⁰C): up to 72 hours.
• Frozen (-20⁰C or lower): up to 1 month.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens with hemolysis, improperly labeled specimens, or
those not meeting the volume requirements.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• HPLC system with UV detector
• Centrifuge
• Analytical balance
• Pipettes and tips
• Refrigerated storage units
Reagents:
• Acetonitrile
• Methanol
• Water (HPLC grade)
• Mobile phase mixture
• Chlorpromazine reference standard
• Internal standard solution
Supplies:
• Sample containers
• Vials
• Syringe filters
• HPLC columns
1. PROCEDURE
A. Pre-Analytical Phase:
1. Specimen Handling:
◦ Centrifuge plasma specimens at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes.
◦ Transfer the supernatant to labeled vials.
2. Calibration Preparation:
◦ Prepare a calibration curve using the chlorpromazine
reference standard dissolved in the mobile phase.
◦ Prepare calibration standards at predetermined
concentrations ensuring a range that includes the lower limit
of detection up to the expected therapeutic levels of
chlorpromazine.
B. Analytical Methods:
1. Sample Preparation:
◦ For each sample, pipette 500 µL of plasma into a clean vial.
◦ Add 500 µL of acetonitrile for protein precipitation.
◦ Vortex the mixture for 30 seconds.
◦ Centrifuge the mixture at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes.
◦ Transfer the supernatant to a new vial and filter through a
syringe filter.
2. HPLC Analysis:
◦ Set the HPLC system parameters as follows:
▪ Column: C18 reverse-phase column
▪ Mobile Phase: Acetonitrile/Water (70:30 v/v)
▪ Flow Rate: 1 mL/min
▪ Injection Volume: 10 µL
▪ Detection Wavelength: 254 nm
◦ Run the calibration standards followed by the prepared
samples.
◦ Ensure blank samples are run between different patient
samples to avoid carryover.
C. Data Analysis:
1. Analyze the chromatograms obtained from HPLC and integrate
the peak areas.
2. Construct the calibration curve by plotting the peak area against
the concentration of chlorpromazine standards.
3. Determine the chlorpromazine concentration in patient samples
using the calibration curve.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
• Analyze quality control samples (low, medium, and high)
alongside patient samples during each batch of analysis.
• Accept or reject runs based on QC results. Recalibrate and rerun
samples if QC falls outside acceptable limits.
• Document all QC results and corrective actions taken.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Review analyzed data for integrity and accuracy.
• Report results to the Laboratory Information System (LIS) and
verify by the technologist.
• Include comments on results where interference or specimen
integrity issues are identified.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Therapeutic range: 50-300 ng/mL
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to the chlorpromazine HPLC method insert for potential
interference and method limitations.

guidelines and validation studies. Always refer to manufacturer's
manuals for detailed instructions if discrepancies arise.
1. REVISION HISTORY
