STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE
1. PURPOSE
This protocol outlines the procedures for the analytical phase of
generating results for CHOCOLATE/CACAO IgG testing, ensuring
that the process is performed accurately and efficiently following
regulatory and laboratory guidelines.
1. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all designated laboratory personnel
responsible for the analysis of CHOCOLATE/CACAO IgG antibodies.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
All designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing
and documenting the CHOCOLATE/CACAO IgG analysis as per this
SOP. Laboratory supervisors must ensure adherence to the protocol
and resolve any issues that arise during the testing.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENT AND STORAGE
• Specimen: Serum
• Volume: Minimum 1 mL serum
• Storage:
◦ Short term (less than 2 weeks): 2-8°C
◦ Long term (greater than 2 weeks): -20°C or colder
• Note: Serum should be free of hemolysis, lipemia, and icterus
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• ELISA Reader (with appropriate software)
• ELISA Washer
• CHOCOLATE/CACAO IgG ELISA Test Kit
• Micro-pipettes
• Disposable pipette tips
• Microplate
• Calibrated incubator (37°C)
• Plate shaker
• Timer
• Distilled or deionized water
• Appropriate PPE (gloves, lab coat, safety glasses)
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparations
• Bring all reagents and samples to room temperature before use.
• Prepare the work area by cleaning and disinfecting the benchtop.
• Ensure all equipment is calibrated and functioning properly.
B. Reagent Preparation
• Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for preparing the reagents,
controls, and standards provided in the ELISA test kit.
• Reconstitute any lyophilized reagents and dilute buffers if
required.
C. Assay Procedure
1. Sample Preparation
◦ Thaw frozen serum samples, if applicable.
◦ Centrifuge the serum samples at 1500-2000 x g for 10
minutes to remove any particulates.
◦ Dilute the serum samples according to the kit instructions
(usually 1:100 or as specified).
2. Plate Loading
◦ Add the appropriate amount of diluted serum sample,
controls, and standards to the designated wells on the
microplate.
◦ Add the antigen/antibody solution provided in the kit to each
well as per the manufacturer's instructions.
◦ Seal the plate with adhesive film and incubate at 37°C for
the specified duration (usually 1 hour).
3. Washing
◦ After incubation, wash the plate thoroughly with the provided
wash buffer using an ELISA washer, following the
manufacturer's recommended washing steps and cycles.
4. Detection
◦ Add the enzyme conjugate (secondary antibody labeled with
an enzyme) to each well. Incubate the microplate as
specified (usually 30 minutes at room temperature).
◦ Wash the plate again as per instructions.
5. Substrate Reaction
◦ Add the substrate solution to each well and incubate in the
dark for the specified time until a color change is observed
(usually 15-30 minutes at room temperature).
6. Stop Reaction
◦ Add the stop solution to each well to halt the reaction. The
color will change from blue to yellow.
D. Reading and Interpretation
1. Plate Reading
◦ Measure the absorbance of each well at 450 nm using an
ELISA reader within 30 minutes after adding the stop
solution.
2. Data Analysis
◦ Use the software supplied with the ELISA reader to
calculate the concentration of CHOCOLATE/CACAO IgG
antibodies in the samples, comparing the absorbance of the
test samples to the standard curve generated from the
standards.
3. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run positive and negative controls with each batch of tests.
• Ensure that the controls fall within the manufacturer’s
recommended ranges to validate the test run.
• Document any deviations from the control ranges and take
corrective actions if necessary.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results must be reviewed and interpreted by a qualified
laboratory technologist.
• Enter and verify results in the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
• Critical values or significant deviations from normal ranges must
be reported immediately to the appropriate healthcare provider.
1. SAFETY
• Follow all safety protocols, including personal protective
equipment (PPE) requirements.
• Handle all biological specimens as potentially infectious.
• Dispose of waste materials, including used microplates and
reagents, according to biohazard waste disposal guidelines.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If any issues arise during the procedure, consult the
manufacturer's troubleshooting guide provided with the ELISA kit.
• Document any problems encountered and corrective actions
taken. Report persistent issues to the laboratory supervisor.
