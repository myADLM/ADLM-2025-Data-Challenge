Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Generating Results for CHOLECYSTOKININ (CCK)
1. PURPOSE
To provide standardized instructions for the analytical phase of
generating results for CHOLECYSTOKININ (CCK) in the laboratory.
This SOP ensures accuracy, consistency, and reliability of test results
in compliance with CLIA requirements.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
The laboratory personnel are responsible for performing the
procedures as outlined and ensuring adherence to this SOP. The
laboratory supervisor is responsible for overseeing the procedure and
ensuring all staff are adequately trained.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred Specimen:
• Plasma: Collected in an EDTA tube, centrifuged, and immediately
frozen.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed or lipemic samples.
• Specimens not transported on dry ice or received at room
temperature.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• Centrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Freezer (-20°C or lower)
• CCK assay kit (validated for use in the laboratory)
• Micropipettes and tips
• EDTA collection tubes
• Recorder/Logbook
• Laboratory Information System (LIS)
5. PROCEDURE
5.1 Sample Preparation:
1. Receive and Accession Sample:
◦ Verify patient information and sample integrity.
◦ Log the sample into the LIS.
2. Centrifugation:
◦ Centrifuge the EDTA tubes at 1,500 x g for 10 minutes at
4°C to separate plasma.
◦ Aliquot the plasma into appropriately labeled tubes for
storage and testing.
3. Storage:
◦ Store samples immediately at -20°C or lower for future
analysis if not processed immediately.
◦ Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
5.2 Analytical Testing:
1. Reagent Preparation:
◦ Prepare reagents according to the manufacturer's
instructions provided with the CCK assay kit.
◦ Equilibrate reagents and samples to room temperature prior
to use.
2. Assay Calibration:
◦ Perform a calibration curve using the standards provided in
the assay kit.
◦ Ensure the calibration meets the acceptance criteria defined
by the manufacturer's instructions.
3. Assay Procedure:
◦ Pipette required volumes of standards, controls, and patient
samples into the assay plate/wells.
◦ Add the enzyme conjugate and substrate as per the specific
assay protocol.
◦ Incubate for the specified duration under defined conditions
(e.g., temperature, light).
◦ Measure the absorbance using a microplate reader set at
the specified wavelength (e.g., 450 nm).
5.3 Quality Control:
• Run quality control samples alongside patient samples to ensure
assay performance.
• Record QC results in the logbook and ensure values fall within the
predefined acceptable range.
• Any out-of-range QC results necessitate troubleshooting and
repeating the assay.
6. CALCULATIONS AND RESULT INTERPRETATION
• Compute the CCK concentrations from the calibration curve using
the absorbance readings.
• Enter the results into the LIS and review for consistency and
accuracy.
• Calculate and record results following specific equations/formula
provided by the assay kit if applicable.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
• Verify results in the LIS.
• Release verified results for clinical interpretation.
• Generate and provide a report to the requesting physician or
healthcare provider.
8. QUALITY CONTROL AND MAINTENANCE
1. External Quality Assessment (EQA):
◦ Participate in EQA programs specific for CCK to ensure
long-term accuracy and reliability.
2. Instrument Maintenance:
◦ Follow the manufacturer’s guidelines for regular
maintenance and calibration of equipment (e.g., microplate
reader, centrifuge).
