Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analysis of Cholesterol in
Body Fluids
1. PURPOSE
To describe the procedure for the quantitative determination of
cholesterol in body fluids using an automated analyzer, providing
accurate and reliable results for clinical diagnosis and management.
Responsibility Designated staff perform cholesterol testing, monitor
quality control, and report results in accordance with this SOP. It is
the responsibility of all staff to ensure adherence to the SOP and
report any procedural issues to the supervisor.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/acceptable specimens:
• Body fluids such as pleural fluid, pericardial fluid, synovial fluid, or
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).
• Specimens should be collected in sterile containers without
additives.
Unacceptable specimens:
• Hemolyzed specimens.
• Specimens with visible contamination.
• Specimens collected in tubes containing anticoagulants such as
EDTA, citrate, or oxalate.
Note: Samples should be kept at 2-8°C if not analyzed immediately
and must be analyzed within 24 hours of collection.

1. PROCEDURE
4.1. Preparation
4.1.1. Ensure the analyzer is properly calibrated and that a daily
maintenance check has been performed. 4.1.2. Perform quality
control (QC) using provided controls to ensure the accuracy and
precision of the analyzer. Review the QC results for acceptability.
4.1.3. Allow body fluid specimens to reach room temperature if stored
at 2-8°C before analysis.
4.2. Analysis
4.2.1. Label sample cups with appropriate patient identifiers. 4.2.2.
Gently mix body fluid specimens to ensure homogeneity. 4.2.3. Load
specimens into sample cups and place in the sample rack of the
analyzer. 4.2.4. Program the analyzer with the appropriate test codes
for cholesterol analysis. 4.2.5. Follow the analyzer’s instructions to
initiate the assay, ensuring all parameters match the manufacturer’s
specifications. 4.2.6. Allow the analyzer to process the specimens
according to the programmed protocol.
4.3. Reporting Results
4.3.1. Results are automatically transmitted to the Laboratory
Information System (LIS) and must be reviewed and verified by the
technologist. 4.3.2. Verify that results fall within the reportable range
of the assay. 4.3.3. If results are outside the normal range or flagged
by the analyzer, re-evaluate the specimen for any pre-analytical
issues, and reanalyze if necessary. 4.3.4. Critical results must be
reported immediately to the ordering physician or designated
healthcare provider and documented according to lab protocols.
1. QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE
5.1. Internal Quality Control
5.1.1. Perform QC analysis using three levels of control material with
each batch of patient specimens. 5.1.2. Document QC results and
compare them against established acceptance criteria. 5.1.3.
Investigate and resolve any QC failures before reporting patient
results.
5.2. External Quality Assurance
5.2.1. Participate in external proficiency testing programs to ensure
the accuracy and comparability of results. 5.2.2. Review and
document external proficiency test results, addressing any
discrepancies or corrective actions as required.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Refer to site-specific reference intervals for cholesterol in body fluids
based on literature and validation studies.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
7.1. Hemolysis can interfere with cholesterol determination and
should be avoided. 7.2. Highly lipemic samples may require
additional intervention or use of a lipemia clearing reagent. 7.3. Refer
to the reagent kit insert for any additional limitations specific to the
cholesterol assay.
