Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Cholesterol, High-Density Lipoprotein (HDL) Results
1. PURPOSE To outline the procedures for the accurate and
precise measurement of cholesterol and high-density
lipoprotein (HDL) in serum samples using automated analyzers
in the clinical laboratory.
Responsibility: It is the responsibility of all designated laboratory
personnel to carry out the procedures as outlined in this document to
ensure accurate and reliable results.
1. SPECIMEN Preferred specimen type: Serum
Collection:
• Ensure the patient is properly prepared and fasting, if required,
prior to sample collection.
• Collect blood using a serum separator tube (SST).
• Allow the blood to clot for at least 30 minutes at room
temperature.
• Centrifuge the blood sample within 1 hour of collection at 3000
rpm for 10 minutes.
• Serum should be clear and free of hemolysis. Hemolyzed
samples are unacceptable.
Storage:
• Analyze the serum sample as soon as possible after preparation.
• If immediate analysis is not possible, store the serum at 2-8°C for
up to 48 hours or at -20°C for longer periods.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Automated chemistry analyzer (approved for cholesterol and HDL
measurements)
• Specific reagent kits for cholesterol and HDL testing
• Calibrators and controls for cholesterol and HDL assays
• SST blood collection tubes
• Centrifuge
• Micropipettes and tips
• Quality control materials
1. PROCEDURE A. Calibration and Quality Control:
• Ensure the analyzer is calibrated using the manufacturer’s
specified calibrators.
• Run quality control (QC) materials at each level (low, medium,
and high) at the start of the analytical run, after calibration, and at
the beginning of each shift.
• Check that QC results meet the acceptable range as defined by
the manufacturer and internal laboratory guidelines. Document all
QC results.
B. Sample Preparation:
• Ensure serum samples are properly labeled and accessioned.
• For each sample, ensure there is no hemolysis or significant
lipemia. If such conditions are present, note the condition before
testing and assess the sample integrity.
C. Cholesterol Assay:
• Load the cholesterol reagent kits on the analyzer as per the
manufacturer's instructions.
• Ensure the reagents are at the correct temperature before use.
• Program the analyzer with the specific cholesterol testing protocol
(use provided assay parameter settings).
• Run the patient serum samples.
• Record the cholesterol measurements. Verify and validate results
in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
D. HDL Assay:
• Load the HDL reagent kits on the analyzer as per the
manufacturer's instructions.
• Ensure the reagents are at the correct temperature before use.
• Program the analyzer with the specific HDL testing protocol (use
provided assay parameter settings).
• Run the patient serum samples.
• Record the HDL measurements. Verify and validate results in the
Laboratory Information System (LIS).
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results generated by the automated analyzer are transmitted to
the LIS.
• The technologist must review and verify results before releasing
them.
• Report results within the reference intervals:
◦ Cholesterol: <200 mg/dL (varies by specific laboratory
guidelines)
◦ HDL: >40 mg/dL for males, >50 mg/dL for females (varies by
specific laboratory guidelines)
• Any critical results or values outside of the acceptable limits must
be rechecked, and the responsible healthcare provider must be
notified immediately.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolyzed samples may produce inaccurate results and should
be avoided.
• Improper sample handling and storage can compromise sample
integrity, affecting accuracy.
• Refer to the manufacturer's package insert for any specific assay
limitations.
1. QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE
• Run internal and external controls regularly as per laboratory
policy.
• Maintain proper calibration and documentation for each batch of
reagents and results.
• Participate in external proficiency testing programs to ensure the
accuracy and reliability of test results.
