Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Cholesterol, Low-Density Lipoprotein
(LDL), Calculated, Serum
1. PURPOSE
This SOP describes the procedures for the quantitative determination
of Cholesterol and the calculation of Low-Density Lipoprotein (LDL) in
serum. The aim is to ensure accuracy, precision, and consistency in
the generation and reporting of results.
RESPONSIBILITY:
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for the accurate and
reliable determination of Cholesterol and LDL levels in serum
samples. They must ensure that quality control procedures are
adhered to and corrective actions are taken when necessary.
1. DEFINITIONS
• Cholesterol: A type of fat found in your blood that is necessary
for building healthy cells but high levels can increase the risk of
heart disease.
• Low-Density Lipoprotein (LDL): Often referred to as "bad"
cholesterol, LDL can build up in the walls of arteries and increase
the risk of heart disease and stroke.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Clinical Chemistry Analyzer (e.g., Roche Cobas c systems or
equivalent)
• Cholesterol Reagent Kit (e.g., Roche Cholesterol Reagent)
• Quality Control Materials (e.g., Bio-Rad Liquichek Control)
• Calibrators (e.g., Roche Calibrator for Automated Systems)
• Serum or plasma samples (heparin or EDTA)
1. PROCEDURE
Specimen Handling:
• Preferred: Serum or plasma.
• Minimum Volume: 1 mL.
• Storage: Keep specimens at 2-8°C and analyze within 7 days.
For longer storage, keep frozen at -20°C or lower. Avoid multiple
freeze-thaw cycles.
A. Cholesterol Determination
1. Preparation of Reagents:
◦ Follow the manufacturer's instructions for preparation of
Cholesterol reagents and calibrators.
2. Calibration:
◦ Perform calibration of the analyzer using the Cholesterol
Calibrator prior to running patient samples. Document
calibration status and any calibration adjustments made.
3. Quality Control:
◦ Run at least two levels of quality control (high and low) with
each batch of patient samples.
◦ Acceptable ranges for controls should be taken from the
product insert. Ensure control results fall within the
established ranges before proceeding.
4. Sample Analysis:
◦ Load patient samples onto the analyzer.
◦ Enter required information (e.g., sample ID, test required).
◦ Analyze samples following the instrument-specific protocols.
◦ The system will generate a concentration readout for
Cholesterol.
B. LDL Calculation
1. Calculation of LDL:
◦ LDL is generally calculated using the Friedewald formula: [
\text{LDL} = \text{Total Cholesterol} - \text{HDL} -
\frac{\text{Triglycerides}}{5} ] Note: This formula is valid if
Triglycerides are <400 mg/dL.
◦ Ensure that the HDL and Triglycerides values are available
from the same patient sample for accurate calculation.
2. Result Verification:
◦ Cross-check LDL results generated with the calculation.
◦ If any results are flagged or out of range, re-evaluate the
initial data and repeat the analysis if necessary.
C. Reporting Results: 7. Results Review and Verification:
• Verify results against the instrument’s quality control and
calibration data.
• If results are within acceptable boundaries, report the results as
per laboratory's protocols.
1. Documentation and Reporting:
◦ Append quality control results, patient identifiers, date, and
time of analysis.
◦ Enter verified results into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
D. Quality Control and Maintenance:
1. Routine Checks:
◦ Record and review routine maintenance logs.
◦ Clean and maintain analyzers according to the
manufacturer's guidelines to ensure optimal performance.
2. Corrective Actions:
• Record any outlying or problematic results along with corrective
action taken in the maintenance log.
• If calibration or control results are outside acceptable limits,
troubleshoot the analyzer, reagents, and procedures before
running any patient samples.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS:
• Total Cholesterol: <200 mg/dL - Desirable, 200-239 mg/dL -
Borderline High, >240 mg/dL - High
• LDL Cholesterol: <100 mg/dL - Optimal, 100-129 mg/dL - Near
Optimal, 130-159 mg/dL - Borderline High, 160-189 mg/dL - High,
≥190 mg/dL - Very High

This SOP seeks to ensure the reliability and accuracy of Cholesterol
and calculated LDL reporting in serum to support clinical decision-
making effectively. Any deviations from the procedure must be
documented and reviewed by the supervisory staff. Ensure
compliance with all regulatory and accreditation requirements.
