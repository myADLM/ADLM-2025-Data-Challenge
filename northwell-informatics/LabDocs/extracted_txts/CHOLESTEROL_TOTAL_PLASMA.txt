SOP for Cholesterol, Total, Plasma
1. PURPOSE
This procedure outlines the analytical process for the measurement
of total cholesterol in plasma samples. The accurate determination of
cholesterol levels in plasma is essential for assessing lipid
metabolism and cardiovascular risk.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of designated laboratory personnel to perform
and document the cholesterol testing accurately and efficiently. All
laboratory personnel must be trained and competent in the procedure
and proficiency evaluated regularly.
1. DEFINITION
Total Cholesterol: Cholesterol is a lipid molecule essential for cellular
structure and function. The total cholesterol test measures the sum of
HDL (high-density lipoprotein), LDL (low-density lipoprotein), and
VLDL (very low-density lipoprotein) cholesterol in the blood.
4.* SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS*
Preferred/Acceptable:
• Plasma collected in EDTA (lavender top) or lithium heparin (green
top) tubes.
• Sample volume required: 2-5 mL.
• Samples should be centrifuged within 2 hours of collection and
plasma separated.
Unacceptable:
• Hemolyzed samples.
• Samples collected in sodium fluoride, oxalate, or citrate tubes.
• Clotted samples.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Automated Chemistry Analyzer (e.g., Roche Cobas, Siemens
Dimension)
• Cholesterol reagent kits and calibrators (e.g., Roche Cholesterol
reagent, calibrators, and control materials)
• Standard laboratory glassware and pipettes
• Centrifuge
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
6.* PROCEDURE*
A) Preparation:
1. Ensure all reagents, consumables, and equipment are within
the expiry date.
2. Calibrate the analyzer as per manufacturer’s guidelines, using
appropriate calibrators.
3. Perform quality controls using normal and abnormal control
materials. Document QC results and verify they are within
acceptable ranges.
B) Sample Processing:
1. Inspect the plasma samples for any signs of hemolysis or
contamination.
2. Centrifuge the blood collection tubes at 1500x g for 10 minutes
to obtain clear plasma.
3. Carefully aliquot the plasma into appropriately labeled
microcentrifuge tubes.
C) Analytical Measurement:
1. Program the chemistry analyzer with the test parameters
specific to cholesterol according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
2. Load the samples, calibrators, and QC materials onto the
analyzer.
3. Initiate the test run, ensuring the analyzer is set up for the
cholesterol assay program.
4. Monitor the run for any errors or alerts indicated by the
analyzer.
D) Interpreting and Reporting Results:
1. Review the results for any flags or errors. Repeat any flagged
tests as necessary.
2. Verify that QC results fall within acceptable ranges – if they do
not, troubleshoot, and repeat both QC and patient tests.
3. Report cholesterol results through the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
4. Ensure that critical results are communicated promptly as per
laboratory policy.
7.* REFERENCE INTERVALS*
• Normal adult reference ranges: <200 mg/dL or <5.17 mmol/L
(Reference ranges may vary based on population and specific
reference laboratory guidelines)
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the Cholesterol Reagent insert for specific limitations of the
assay, including possible interferences from hemolysis, lipemia, and
icterus.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
2. Internal Quality Control: Perform daily quality control
procedures using commercially available control materials at
different concentration levels.
3. External Proficiency Testing: Participate in recognized
proficiency testing programs as per CLIA regulations.
4. Documentation: Maintain detailed records of calibrations, QC
results, and maintenance logs.
