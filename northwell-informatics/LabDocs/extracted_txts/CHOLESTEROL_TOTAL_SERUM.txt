SOP for Cholesterol, Total, Serum Analysis
1. PURPOSE To provide standardized procedures for the
analytical phase of generating results for Cholesterol, Total,
Serum, ensuring results are accurate, precise, and generated in
a timely manner.
Responsibility: It is the responsibility of the laboratory technologist to
follow these procedures when performing Cholesterol, Total, Serum
analysis and to bring any issues to the attention of a supervisor.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred Specimen:
• Serum: 5 mL of blood is collected in a serum separator tube
(SST).
• The specimen must be allowed to clot for 30 minutes before
centrifugation.
• Centrifuge the SST tube at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes.
• Transfer serum to an aliquot tube if required, avoiding hemolysis.
Specimen Stability:
• The serum specimen is stable for up to 7 days at 2-8°C.
• If analysis cannot be done within 7 days, specimens should be
frozen at -20°C and are stable for up to 6 months. Avoid repeated
freeze-thaw cycles.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens that are grossly hemolytic, significantly lipemic, or
icteric should be rejected.
1. REAGENTS, CONSUMABLES, AND EQUIPMENT
• Reagent: Cholesterol Enzymatic Assay Reagent
• Equipment: Automated Chemistry Analyzer
• Calibration: Cholesterol standard (provided by the reagent
manufacturer)
• Quality Control Material: Multi-Level Cholesterol Control Set
1. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
• Ensure all reagents and controls are within their expiration dates
and prepared as per the manufacturer’s instructions.
• Perform calibration and QC procedures before running patient
samples.
Calibration:
• Run calibration following the procedure outlined by the reagent
manufacturer.
• Verify the calibration curve by running quality control samples with
known cholesterol concentrations.
• Calibration should be performed:
◦ With each new lot of reagent.
◦ After major maintenance on the analyzer.
◦ If QC results are outside the acceptable range.
Quality Control:
• Analyze low, medium, and high controls at the beginning of each
shift.
• Ensure QC results are within the established control limits.
• Document all QC results on a QC log sheet and investigate any
out-of-range results before proceeding with patient sample
analysis.
Automated Analysis:
• Load patient samples onto the automated chemistry analyzer.
• Select the Cholesterol, Total, Serum assay and start the analysis.
• The analyzer will automatically perform the assay and calculate
cholesterol concentrations based on the established calibration
curve.
Manual Analysis (if automated platform is unavailable):
• Ensure all reagents are at room temperature and vortex before
use.
• Pipette 1 mL of reagent into a clean reaction cuvette.
• Add 10 µL of patient serum to the reagent.
• Mix thoroughly and incubate at 37°C for 10 minutes.
• Measure the absorbance at 500 nm using a spectrophotometer.
• Calculate the cholesterol concentration using the calibration curve
established from the standards.
• Record the absorbance and calculated cholesterol concentration
for each sample.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Automatically generated results will be transferred to the LIS for
review and verification by the technologist.
• Review results for integrity and consistency.
• Verify results before releasing to the ordering provider.
• Critical values should be reported immediately to the ordering
physician as per laboratory policy.
Reference Intervals:
• Adult Males: 125-200 mg/dL
• Adult Females: 125-200 mg/dL
1. QUALITY CONTROL AND TROUBLESHOOTING
• If QC fails repeatedly, recalibrate the analyzer and rerun controls.
• Check for potential issues such as reagent expiration, instrument
malfunction, or sample integrity issues.
• Document all troubleshooting actions and outcomes.
• Perform parallel testing with another cholesterol method if
available, and compare results for consistency.
1. MAINTENANCE
• Perform daily, weekly, and monthly maintenance on the analyzer
as per the manufacturer’s guidelines.
• Document all maintenance activities in the maintenance log.
