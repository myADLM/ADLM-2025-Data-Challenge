Protocol for Analytical Phase of Generating Results for
Cholesteryl Esters, Serum
1. PURPOSE To provide a standardized procedure for the
accurate and timely analysis of cholesteryl esters in serum
samples.
2. SCOPE This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel involved in
the sample preparation, analysis, and reporting of cholesteryl
esters in serum.
3. RESPONSIBILITIES
• Laboratory personnel are responsible for following this SOP to
ensure accurate and reliable results.
• Supervisors are responsible for providing training and ensuring
adherence to this SOP.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred Specimen: Fasting serum sample
• Collection: Collect blood using standard venipuncture technique
into a serum separator tube (SST).
• Processing: Centrifuge the sample at 3000 RPM for 10 minutes
to separate serum.
• Storage: Store serum at 2-8°C if analysis is to be performed
within 48 hours. For longer storage, aliquot and freeze at -20°C or
lower.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) or suitable
analytical instrumentation
• Cholesteryl Esters Reference Standards
• Internal Standards
• Mobile phase and solvents (HPLC-grade)
• Calibration and Quality Control (QC) materials
• Centrifuge
• Vortex Mixer
• Micropipettes and tips
• Sample vials and caps
1. PROCEDURE Preparation of Calibration and QC Samples:
◦ Prepare calibration standards by diluting cholesteryl esters
reference standards in a suitable solvent to cover the
expected range of concentrations in serum samples.
◦ Prepare QC samples at low, medium, and high
concentrations.
Sample Preparation:
1. Thaw serum samples if frozen; bring to room temperature.
2. Vortex each sample for 30 seconds.
3. Pipette 100 µL of serum into a labeled microcentrifuge tube.
4. Add 500 µL of a suitable extraction solvent (e.g.,
hexane:isopropanol).
5. Vortex thoroughly for 1 minute.
6. Centrifuge the mixture at 3000 RPM for 10 minutes.
7. Transfer the organic phase to a new tube and evaporate under
nitrogen stream.
8. Reconstitute the dried extract in 100 µL of mobile phase or
suitable solvent.
9. Vortex and transfer to an HPLC vial for analysis.
Instrument Setup and Analysis:
1. Set up the HPLC or analytical instrument according to the
manufacturer's operating manual.
2. Calibrate the instrument using prepared calibration standards.
3. Run QC samples to verify calibration and performance.
4. Load prepared serum samples, calibration standards, and QC
samples into the instrument.
5. Start the analysis and ensure proper documentation of the
sequence.
6. DATA ANALYSIS AND REPORTING
◦ After the analysis, review the chromatograms for peak
integration and correct identification of cholesteryl esters.
◦ Calculate the concentration of cholesteryl esters in serum
samples using the calibration curve.
◦ Validate the results using QC samples to ensure accuracy.
◦ Report the results in the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
7. QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE
◦ Run quality control samples at the start and end of each
analytical batch.
◦ If QC results are outside the acceptable range, troubleshoot
and repeat the analysis for affected samples.
◦ Document all QC results and any corrective actions taken.
8. REFERENCE INTERVALS
◦ Reference intervals for cholesteryl esters will be determined
based on population studies and validated against the
instrument and method in use.
9. LIMITATIONS
• Hemolyzed or lipemic samples may interfere with analysis.
• Incorrect sample handling or preparation can affect the accuracy
of results.
1. SAFETY AND REFERENCE
• Follow all laboratory safety protocols including the use of PPE.
• Refer to the instrument user manual and reagent safety data
sheets for detailed instructions.
