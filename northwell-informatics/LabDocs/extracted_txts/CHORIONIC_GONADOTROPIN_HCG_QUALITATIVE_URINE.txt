Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Title: Chorionic Gonadotropin
(hCG), Qualitative, Urine - Analytical Phase
1. PURPOSE To outline the steps and procedures necessary for
the qualitative analysis of Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG) in
urine to ensure accurate and reliable results are reported.
Responsibility: All laboratory personnel trained in urinalysis
procedures are responsible for performing this test and documenting
the results according to this SOP. It is the duty of the supervisory staff
to ensure that appropriate training is provided and that procedures
are followed correctly.
1. SPECIMEN Preferred/acceptable:
• Fresh urine collected in a clean, dry container.
• Specimens should ideally be tested immediately after collection
but may be stored at 2-8°C for up to 24 hours if testing is delayed.
Unacceptable:
• Specimens arriving in the laboratory more than 24 hours after
collection.
• Specimens that are visibly contaminated with blood, feces, or
other substances.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• hCG Test Kits (lateral flow assays or similar).
• Timer or stopwatch.
• Control materials – positive control and negative control.
• Disposable pipettes (if required by test kits).
• Urine collection containers.
• Appropriate laboratory PPE (gloves, lab coat, eye protection).
1. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation:
1. Allow the test devices and urine specimens to reach room
temperature before testing.
2. Verify that the test kits have not expired and that all reagents
and controls are within their use-by dates.
3. Gather and check all necessary equipment and materials.
B) Testing:
1. Label the test device with the patient’s identifier.
2. If required, use a disposable pipette to transfer the specified
amount of urine (usually 3 drops or the volume indicated by the
manufacturer) to the sample well of the test device.
3. Start the timer.
4. Wait for the duration specified by the manufacturer (usually 3-5
minutes) without disturbing the test device.
C) Interpretation of Results:
1. After the appointed time has elapsed, read the results.
2. Follow the manufacturer's instructions to interpret the test lines:
◦ A positive result is indicated by the presence of both the
control line and the test line.
◦ A negative result is indicated by the presence of only the
control line.
◦ An invalid result is indicated by the absence of the control
line (whether the test line appears or not). Repeat the test
with a new device if the result is invalid.
D) Quality Control:
1. Run positive and negative control samples concurrently with
patient samples to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the test
results.
2. Document the results of the quality control tests.
3. If control tests do not yield expected results, do not report
patient results and troubleshoot the issue according to the
manufacturer's guidelines or lab-specific protocols.
4. REPORTING RESULTS:
• Positive and negative results are recorded in the laboratory
information system (LIS).
• Results should be reviewed and verified by a qualified
technologist.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS: Refer to the test kit manufacturer's
insert for a detailed list of method limitations, including potential
interferences, cross-reactivity, and false positive/negative
results.
2. REFERENCES: Manufacturer's insert and guidelines for the
specific hCG test kits in use.
3. RECORD KEEPING: Maintain records of all test results, quality
control data, and any corrective actions taken, as per laboratory
documentation policies.
By adhering to this Standard Operating Procedure, the laboratory
ensures the proper processing and accurate reporting of qualitative
hCG test results.
