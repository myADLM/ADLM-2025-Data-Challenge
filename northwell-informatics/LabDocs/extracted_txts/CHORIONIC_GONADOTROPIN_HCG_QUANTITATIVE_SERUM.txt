Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Quantitative Serum
Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG) Testing
1. PURPOSE
This procedure outlines the process for the quantitative determination
of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) levels in serum samples.
This test is typically used for the detection of pregnancy, monitoring
pregnancy progression, and in some cases, for the detection of
certain types of cancers and other medical conditions.
Responsibility
It is the responsibility of designated laboratory personnel to conduct
the hCG tests, analyze the data, and ensure all results meet quality
standards before reporting them.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND PREPARATION
◦ Specimen Type:
▪ Serum is the required specimen type for this assay.
◦ Collection:
▪ Collect blood using standard venipuncture techniques
into an appropriate collection tube (e.g., a red-top tube or
a serum separator tube).
▪ Allow blood to clot at room temperature for at least 30
minutes.
◦ Separation:
▪ Centrifuge the blood sample at 1000-2000 g for 10
minutes to separate serum from the clot within 2 hours of
collection.
▪ Transfer the serum to a labeled aliquot tube if not tested
immediately.
Storage:
• If the test will be performed within 48 hours, store the serum at
2-8°C.
• For longer storage, freeze the serum at -20°C or colder.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric specimens.
• Specimens collected in tubes containing anticoagulants (e.g.,
EDTA, heparin).
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
◦ Equipment:
▪ Automated immunoassay analyzer (e.g., Roche Cobas
e411, Siemens Immulite).
▪ Centrifuge.
▪ Calibrated micropipettes and tips.
▪ Refrigerator and freezer for specimen storage.
◦ Reagents:
▪ hCG reagent kits specific to the analyzer being used.
▪ Quality control materials (low, medium, and high hCG
concentration).
▪ Calibration standards provided by the manufacturer.
◦ Supplies:
▪ Disposable gloves.
▪ Labeled aliquot tubes.
▪ Kimwipes or similar for cleaning.
▪ Laboratory-grade distilled water for reagent preparation.
2. PROCEDURE
Calibration:
• Calibrate the analyzer using manufacturer-provided calibration
standards following the manufacturer’s instructions.
• Calibration must be performed with each new lot of reagents or if
quality control results are outside acceptable limits.
Quality Control:
• Run quality control samples (low, medium, and high) at the
beginning of each testing day, after any analyzer maintenance,
after reagent lot change, and when results are questioned.
• Quality control results must fall within established acceptable
ranges before patient results can be reported. Document all QC
results.
Testing Procedure:
1. Ensure serum samples are at room temperature prior to testing.
Mix gently by inversion.
2. Load quality control samples, calibrators, and patient serum
samples into the analyzer following the manufacturer’s
instructions.
3. Program the analyzer according to the manufacturer’s
instructions for the hCG test.
4. Start the assay run. The analyzer will automatically process the
samples and read the results.
5. Monitor the assay run for any flags or errors.
6. Once the run is complete, review the QC results. If QC results
are acceptable, proceed to review patient results.
Reporting Results:
• Review and verify results in the laboratory information system
(LIS).
• Report results in mIU/mL (milli-International Units per milliliter).
• The reference range for a non-pregnant adult female typically is <
5 mIU/mL. Note that reference values may vary by lab and should
be confirmed with the performing lab’s established ranges.
Critical Values:
• Report immediately to the requesting physician any hCG results
that are significantly elevated and suggestive of pregnancy or
related pathology.
1. MAINTENANCE AND TROUBLESHOOTING
Maintenance:
• Follow the manufacturer’s guidelines for daily, weekly, monthly,
and as-needed maintenance of the analyzer.
• Document all maintenance activities in the maintenance log.
Troubleshooting:
• If quality control fails, repeat the control run. If it fails again,
recalibrate the analyzer and run controls again.
• In the case of analyzer errors, refer to the manufacturer's
troubleshooting guide and notify the supervisor if necessary.
1. LIMITATIONS
◦ hCG levels can be elevated in various conditions unrelated
to pregnancy, such as certain cancers (e.g., trophoblastic
disease, germ cell tumors).
◦ The presence of heterophile antibodies or other assay
interference can result in falsely high or low hCG levels.
2. REFERENCE INTERVALS AND INTERPRETATION
◦ The interpretation of quantitative hCG levels should always
be done in conjunction with clinical findings and additional
laboratory tests if necessary.
◦ Establish reference intervals may vary and should be
established per lab’s patient population and verified
according to laboratory protocols.
3. REFERENCES
◦ Manufacturer’s instructions for the specific hCG reagent kit
and analyzer.
◦ Relevant clinical guidelines and laboratory standards (e.g.,
CLSI guidelines).
◦ Peer-reviewed literature on hCG testing and its clinical
applications.
