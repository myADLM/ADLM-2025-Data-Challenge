Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase Procedure for Chromatin (Nucleosomal)
Antibody Testing
1. PURPOSE
To provide a detailed procedure for performing chromatin
(nucleosomal) antibody testing in the laboratory to ensure accurate
and reliable results.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel involved in the analytical
phase of chromatin (nucleosomal) antibody testing.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of trained laboratory personnel to ensure that
all steps in this procedure are followed accurately. The designated
supervisor is responsible for overseeing the analysis and addressing
any issues that arise.
4. DEFINITIONS
• Chromatin (Nucleosomal) Antibody: An autoantibody directed
against chromatin, which consists of DNA and histone proteins,
and is used as a marker in certain autoimmune diseases.
5. PROCEDURE
A. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies:
1. Microplate reader, capable of reading at the appropriate
wavelength for the ELISA assay (generally 450 nm)
2. Centrifuge
3. Pipettes and pipette tips
4. Chromatin (Nucleosomal) Antibody ELISA Kit
5. Incubator set at 37°C
6. Washing buffer (as provided in the kit)
7. Substrate solution
8. Stop solution
9. Distilled water
B. Specimen Requirements:
1. Preferred specimens: Serum samples collected in plain or
serum-separating tubes.
2. Unacceptable specimens: Hemolyzed, lipemic, or significantly
icteric samples. Avoid using plasma collected in EDTA, citrate,
or heparin tubes.
3. Storage: Specimens should be stored at 2-8°C if analyzed
within 48 hours. For longer storage, freeze specimens at -20°C
or colder.
C. Reagent Preparation:
1. Prepare all reagents according to the manufacturer's
instructions included in the ELISA kit.
2. Bring all reagents and samples to room temperature before
beginning the assay.
3. Mix all reagents thoroughly but gently to avoid foaming.
D. Assay Procedure:
1. Sample Preparation:
◦ Thaw frozen specimens and bring them to room
temperature.
◦ Mix thoroughly before use.
2. Coating Step:
◦ Determine the number of wells required for the assay,
including standards, controls, and patient samples in
duplicate.
◦ Add the prepared reagents to each well according to the kit
instructions.
3. Incubation:
◦ Add the appropriate volume of serum samples, controls, and
standards to designated wells.
◦ Incubate the microplate for the time specified in the kit
instructions at room temperature or as recommended.
4. Washing:
◦ Wash the plate as directed using the wash buffer. Ensure
complete removal of any unbound materials.
5. Secondary Antibody Addition:
◦ Add the secondary antibody solution to each well.
◦ Incubate the plate again as per the kit's instructions.
6. Wash and Substrate Addition:
◦ Perform another washing step to remove unbound
secondary antibodies.
◦ Add the appropriate substrate solution to each well.
7. Detection:
◦ Incubate the plate for the specified time, ensuring the
enzymatic reaction occurs in the substrate.
◦ Add stop solution to each well to terminate the reaction.
8. Reading:
◦ Measure the optical density (OD) of each well at the
specified wavelength using a microplate reader.
E. Quality Control:
1. Run positive and negative controls with every assay to verify
the performance of the test.
2. Review control results to ensure they fall within the specified
range. Investigate and address any deviations before reporting
patient results.
F. Reporting Results:
1. Calculate the results based on the manufacturer's instructions,
using the provided calibration curve.
2. Report the results according to established guidelines in the
laboratory information system (LIS).
3. Notify the designated supervisor of any critical or unexpected
results.
G. Method Limitations:
Refer to the kit insert for detailed limitations regarding sensitivity,
specificity, and potential interferences.
H. References:

provided by the manufacturer.
6. DOCUMENTATION AND RECORD KEEPING
All records, including temperature logs, assay worksheets, and
instrument printouts, should be maintained and stored according to
laboratory guidelines.
7. REVIEW AND APPROVAL
This SOP is subject to annual review and approval by the laboratory
supervisor. Any updates or changes will be documented and
communicated to all relevant personnel.
