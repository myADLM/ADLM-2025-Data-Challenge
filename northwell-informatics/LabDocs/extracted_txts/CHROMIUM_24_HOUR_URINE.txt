Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) for Chromium, 24 Hour,
Urine Analysis
1. PURPOSE:
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the steps for the analytical
phase of generating results for Chromium, 24 Hour, Urine.
2. RESPONSIBILITY:
It is the responsibility of designated laboratory personnel to perform
all steps outlined in this SOP, ensuring accuracy and adherence to
defined protocols. It is also the responsibility of the personnel to
identify and report any issues that may affect the quality of results to
the supervisor.
3. DEFINITION:
Chromium, 24 Hour, Urine analysis is used to measure the level of
chromium excreted in the urine over a 24-hour period. This test is
useful in the diagnosis and monitoring of exposure to chromium.
4. PROCEDURE:
A. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies:
• Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer (ICP-MS)
• Calibration standards for Chromium
• Control samples (high, medium, and low concentration)
• Ultrapure water
• Nitric acid for sample digestion
• 24-hour urine collection container with appropriate preservatives
(if required by testing method)
• Vortex mixer
• Centrifuge
• Laboratory glassware (e.g., beakers, pipettes, volumetric flasks)
B. Preparation of Reagents and Calibration Standards:
1. Preparation of Calibration Standards:
◦ Prepare calibration standards for Chromium in different
concentrations (e.g., 1 ppb, 5 ppb, 10 ppb, 20 ppb, etc.).
◦ Use ultrapure water and nitric acid to prepare the standards.
◦ Store the standards in appropriately labelled containers.
2. Preparation of Control Samples:
◦ Control samples are obtained from a commercial source
and used as provided.
◦ Aliquot control samples into appropriate containers and
label with relevant information.
C. Sample Preparation:
1. Identification and Logging:
◦ Upon receiving 24-hour urine samples, ensure they are
properly labelled with patient identification and collection
information.
◦ Log the samples into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS) and assign unique identifiers.
2. Sample Digestion:
◦ Measure and record the total volume of urine collected in 24
hours.
◦ Aliquot an appropriate volume of urine (e.g., 5-10 mL) for
analysis.
◦ Add nitric acid (concentrated) to the urine sample to achieve
a 1-3% solution.
◦ Vortex the sample thoroughly.
◦ If required, centrifuge the sample at 1500 rpm for 10
minutes to remove any particulate matter.
◦ Transfer the supernatant to a clean polypropylene tube for
analysis.
D. Calibration and Quality Control:
1. Calibration of ICP-MS:
◦ Perform an initial calibration of the ICP-MS using the
prepared calibration standards.
◦ Run the standards starting from the lowest to the highest
concentration.
◦ Verify calibration with a mid-range standard after every
10-15 samples to ensure accuracy.
2. Quality Control Checks:
◦ Analyze low, medium, and high concentration control
samples at the beginning, middle, and end of the sample
batch.
◦ Record the quality control results. Acceptable ranges for QC
samples are determined by the laboratory validation
process.
E. Analysis of Samples:
1. Sample Analysis:
◦ Introduce prepared urine samples into the ICP-MS.
◦ Run samples in the same sequence they were logged.
◦ Ensure the instrument is in optimal operating conditions
before running each sample.
◦ Record the Chromium concentration for each sample.
2. Data Review and Validation:
◦ Review raw data for any anomalies or instrument errors.
◦ Ensure that quality control results are within acceptable
limits.
◦ If QC samples fall outside of the acceptable range, re-
calibration or troubleshooting may be required, followed by
reanalysis of affected samples.
F. Reporting of Results:
1. Data Entry:
◦ Enter Chromium concentration results into the LIS for each
patient sample, ensuring accuracy.
◦ Calculate the total Chromium excretion per 24 hours based
on the total volume of urine collected.
2. Verification and Validation:
◦ Results must be reviewed and validated by the responsible
technologist.
◦ Any results falling outside of reference ranges should be
flagged for further review.
3. Reporting:
◦ Verify that all results are correctly entered and validated in
the LIS.
◦ Report validated results to the appropriate healthcare
provider or referring physician.
5. REFERENCE RANGES:
• Reference ranges for Chromium in a 24-hour urine specimen may
vary. Ensure to verify and use laboratory-specific reference
intervals.
6. QUALITY ASSURANCE:
• Participate in regular proficiency testing.
• Conduct routine maintenance and calibration of the ICP-MS as
per manufacturer guidelines.
• Review and update this SOP annually or as required by changes
in procedures or equipment.
7. REFERENCES:
• Manufacturer’s manual for ICP-MS
• Clinical guidelines for monitoring chromium exposure (refer to
latest publications)
