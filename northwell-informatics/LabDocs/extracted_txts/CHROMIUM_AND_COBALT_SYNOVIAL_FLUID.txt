Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Chromium and Cobalt
Analysis in Synovial Fluid
1. PURPOSE
This SOP describes the procedure for analyzing chromium and cobalt
levels in synovial fluid using inductively coupled plasma mass
spectrometry (ICP-MS). This procedure ensures that all staff follow
consistent and accurate methods for sample analysis,
documentation, and result verification.
RESPONSIBILITY
All laboratory technologists performing chromium and cobalt analysis
in synovial fluid are responsible for adhering to this SOP. It is the
responsibility of the laboratory supervisors to ensure this SOP is
followed, updated, and that technologists are adequately trained.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen Type:
• Synovial fluid.
Sample Collection:
• Utilize sterile, metal-free syringes and collection containers to
avoid trace metal contamination.
• Preferred specimen volume: Minimum of 2 mL of synovial fluid.
• Mix the sample thoroughly to ensure homogeneity.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens not collected in a metal-free container.
• Specimens visibly contaminated with blood.
• Insufficient volume (<2 mL).
• Incorrectly labeled specimens.
Stability:
• Analyze immediately if possible.
• If analysis is delayed, store at 2-8°C for up to 24 hours or frozen
at -20°C for long-term storage up to 3 months.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer (ICP-MS).
• Metal-free pipettes and tips.
• Vortex mixer.
• Ultra-pure water system.
Reagents:
• High purity nitric acid (HNO3).
• Certified chromium and cobalt standards.
• Quality control materials specific for chromium and cobalt.
Supplies:
• Metal-free collection containers.
• Polypropylene tubes.
• Disposable gloves.
• Calibration standard solution.
• Diluent: 1% HNO3 or other suitable diluent as per specific
equipment recommendations.
1. PROCEDURE
Sample Preparation:
1. Vortex the synovial fluid sample for 30 seconds to ensure
homogeneity.
2. Pipette a 0.5 mL aliquot of the sample into a polypropylene
digestion tube.
3. Add 0.5 mL of high purity nitric acid and vortex to mix.
4. Let the sample digest at room temperature for 30 minutes.
5. Dilute the digested sample with ultra-pure water to a final
volume of 10 mL.
6. Mix the sample thoroughly.
Instrument Setup:
1. Initialize the ICP-MS and follow the manufacturer's instructions
for instrument startup and calibration.
2. Calibrate the ICP-MS with certified chromium and cobalt
standards.
3. Run initial instrument QC checks with low, medium, and high
concentration QC materials to ensure instrument accuracy and
precision.
Analysis:
1. Run a blank sample to check for contamination.
2. Analyze the prepared samples using the ICP-MS.
3. Include quality control samples (low, medium, high) in each
batch to monitor accuracy and precision.
4. Ensure the sample sequence alternates between patient
samples and quality control samples to detect any carry-over.
Quality Control:
• Verify that QC samples meet predefined acceptance criteria
before proceeding with patient sample analysis.
• If QC samples fall outside the acceptable range, troubleshoot and
re-run the QC samples until acceptable results are obtained
before reporting patient results.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
Data Entry:
1. Transfer the results from the ICP-MS software to the laboratory
information system (LIS).
2. Review and verify the results.
Critical Values:
• Chromium and cobalt levels above 5 μg/L should be flagged as
critical and promptly reported to the ordering physician.
Reference Intervals:
• Chromium: <1 μg/L.
• Cobalt: <1 μg/L.
Report Format:
1. Record results in μg/L.
2. Include any comments on sample integrity if required.
3. QUALITY CONTROL
Internal Quality Control:
• Run internal QC samples at the beginning, middle, and end of
each analytical batch.
• Document all QC results and investigate any out-of-range results.
Troubleshooting:
• If any technical issues arise during analysis, refer to the
instrument's user manual for troubleshooting steps.
• Document all troubleshooting actions and outcomes.
