Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Chromium (Blood)
Analysis
1. PURPOSE
To outline the analytical procedures for determining chromium levels
in blood specimens. This SOP ensures the accurate measurement
and reporting of chromium concentrations, which are essential for
diagnosing and monitoring conditions such as chromium deficiency
or toxicity.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of designated laboratory personnel to follow this
SOP, perform chromium analysis on blood specimens, report results
accurately, and take any necessary corrective action if results fall
outside acceptable limits.
2. DEFINITION
Chromium is a trace element found in human blood and is essential
for normal glucose metabolism. Measurement of chromium levels
assists in diagnosing various metabolic conditions and monitoring
exposure to chromium.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Acceptable Specimens:
• Specimen Type: Whole blood
• Collection Container: Heparinized vacutainer (dark green or PST)
• Volume: Minimum of 2 mL
• Transport: Specimens must be transported directly to the
laboratory within 2 hours of collection. If transportation time
exceeds 2 hours, the specimen must be stored at 2-8°C and
analyzed within 24 hours.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed specimens
• Specimens collected in incorrectly labeled containers
• Specimens arriving more than 24 hours after collection without
proper storage
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Graphite Furnace Atomic Absorption Spectrometer (GFAAS) or
Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) for
measurement
• Heparinized vacutainer tubes
• Calibrated pipettes
• Di-water (Deionized water)
• Chromium standards for calibration
• Acid cleaning solutions
• Personal protective equipment (PPE) including gloves, lab coat,
and safety glasses
5. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Ensure all equipment is calibrated and cleaned according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
2. Prepare chromium standard solutions for calibration of the
instrument.
3. Verify functioning by running quality control samples.
Sample Analysis:
1. Mix the whole blood specimen gently to ensure
homogenization.
2. Aliquot 0.5 mL of blood into a clean, acid-washed digestion
tube.
3. Add 0.5 mL of concentrated nitric acid to the tube and digest
the sample at 95°C until complete digestion is achieved.
4. Allow the digested sample to cool and dilute to a final volume of
10 mL with Di-water.
5. Load the sample into the GFAAS or ICP-MS according to
instrument-specific protocol.
6. Run the sample and document the concentration of chromium.
Quality Control:
1. Run chromium standards and quality control samples before
analyzing patient specimens.
2. Ensure that the results from QC samples fall within acceptable
ranges.
3. If QC fails, troubleshoot the instrument, reagents, or method
before analyzing patient samples.
Reporting Results:
1. Verify results on the instrument software and ensure correct
identification of each sample.
2. Document the chromium concentration in the laboratory
information system (LIS).
3. Critical values and abnormal results must be flagged and
promptly reviewed by a supervisor.
4. Report results following site-specific reporting guidelines.
6. TARGET TOLERANCE LIMITS
Reference intervals for blood chromium levels:
• Normal: 0.05 – 0.5 µg/L
7. METHOD LIMITATIONS
1. Hemolyzed specimens may affect the accuracy of chromium
measurements.
2. Proper specimen collection and handling are essential to avoid
contamination.
3. Ensure that all glassware and plasticware used are free from
chromium contamination.
8. QUALITY ASSURANCE
• Perform routine maintenance on analytical equipment as per
manufacturer’s guidelines.
• Conduct proficiency testing periodically to ensure accuracy.
• Maintain an up-to-date log of quality control results, instrument
calibrations, and maintenance.

NOTE: This SOP must be reviewed annually and updated as
required to maintain compliance with regulatory standards and
ensure the accuracy of chromium blood analysis.
