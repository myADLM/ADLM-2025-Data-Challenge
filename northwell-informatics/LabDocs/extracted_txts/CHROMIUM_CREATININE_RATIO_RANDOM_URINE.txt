Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Chromium/Creatinine
Ratio, Random, Urine
1. PURPOSE: This protocol outlines the procedure for the analysis of
Chromium/Creatinine Ratio in random urine samples to ensure
accurate and precise results. The analysis is used to monitor and
assess levels of chromium exposure in individuals.
2. SCOPE: This SOP applies to all laboratory staff conducting the
analysis of Chromium/Creatinine Ratio in random urine samples
within the laboratory.
3. DEFINITIONS:
• Chromium (Cr): A metal that can be found in different forms and
at varying levels of toxicity.
• Creatinine (Crn): A waste product generated from muscle
metabolism, used as a reference for normalizing urine analyte
concentrations.
• Chromium/Creatinine Ratio: The concentration of chromium
adjusted for urine dilution variability by dividing it by the
concentration of creatinine.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS:
• Specimen Type: Random urine sample.
• Volume: At least 10 mL of urine.
• Handling: Specimens should be collected in a clean container,
labeled correctly, and stored at 2-8°C if not analyzed immediately.
Avoid contamination by skin, paper, or metal.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES:
• Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) or
Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (AAS) for chromium analysis.
• Enzymatic creatinine assay reagents.
• Calibrated pipettes.
• Centrifuge.
• Urine containers.
• Personal protective equipment.
6. PROCEDURE:
A) Sample Preparation and Storage:
1. Labeling and Logging:
◦ Verify the sample identification and log it into the Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
2. Pre-analytical Processing:
◦ Inspect the sample for volume and adequacy.
◦ If the sample volume is insufficient or compromised, request
a new specimen.
3. Storage:
◦ Store urine samples at 2-8°C if immediate analysis is not
feasible.
◦ Ensure samples are analyzed within 72 hours of receipt.
B) Chromium Analysis:
1. Instrumentation:
◦ Calibrate ICP-MS or AAS as per manufacturer’s guidelines.
◦ Perform instrument maintenance checks.
2. Preparation:
◦ Centrifuge the sample at 3000 rpm for 5 minutes to remove
particulates.
◦ Dilute urine sample appropriately with de-ionized water if
necessary.
3. Analysis:
◦ Introduce the prepared sample into the ICP-MS/AAS
system.
◦ Record the chromium concentration in micrograms per liter
(µg/L).
C) Creatinine Analysis:
1. Preparation:
◦ Use the enzymatic creatinine assay kit as per the
manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Calibrate the spectrophotometer.
2. Analysis:
◦ Add appropriate reagents to the urine sample.
◦ Incubate and measure the absorbance.
◦ Calculate the creatinine concentration in milligrams per
deciliter (mg/dL).
D) Calculation of Chromium/Creatinine Ratio:
1. Equation:
◦ Use the formula: [ \text{Chromium/Creatinine Ratio}
\left(\frac{\mu g}{g} \right)= \frac{\text{Chromium
concentration} (\mu g/L)}{\text{Creatinine concentration}
(mg/dL)} \times 100 ]
2. Result Expression:
◦ Report the ratio in micrograms of chromium per gram of
creatinine (µg/g Crn).
7. QUALITY CONTROL:
• Run internal and external quality controls in parallel with patient
samples.
• Use certified reference materials for calibration.
• Ensure QC results are within established acceptable ranges
before reporting patient results.
• Document all QC data and corrective actions for any out-of-range
results.
8. REPORTING RESULTS:
• Review all results to ensure accuracy and validate through LIS.
• Critical results should be communicated directly to the healthcare
provider.
• Results should adhere to reference intervals provided by the
testing guidelines.
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
• Ensure no contamination occurs during sample collection and
handling.
• Presence of interfering substances should be considered and
documented.
10. REFERENCES:
• Refer to manufacturer manuals for ICP-MS/AAS and creatinine
assay kits.
• CLSI Guidelines on Trace Metals in Urine Testing.
