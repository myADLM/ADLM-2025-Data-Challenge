Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Chromium Occupational Exposure, Random,
Urine
1. PURPOSE
This procedure outlines the analytical process for determining
chromium levels in urine samples for occupational exposure
monitoring. It provides instructions for sample preparation, assay
procedures, data acquisition, and result validation.
Responsibility: It is the responsibility of the laboratory technologist to
follow this procedure for analyzing urine samples for their chromium
content. Supervisors are responsible for ensuring that the
technologists adhere to this SOP and for addressing any deviations
or issues that arise during the process.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen:
• Preferred: 10 mL of random urine collected in a clean, plastic
container without preservatives.
• Stability: Store specimens refrigerated at 2-8°C if they are to be
analyzed within 24 hours. For longer storage, freeze at -20°C.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Samples contaminated with fecal matter.
• Samples without proper labeling or missing collection dates.
• Samples received more than 24 hours after collection without
refrigeration or freezing.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer (ICP-MS)
• Analytical balance
• Centrifuge
• Polypropylene tubes and pipettes
• Vortex mixer
Reagents:
• Dilute nitric acid (trace-metal grade)
• Deionized water
• Chromium standard solutions for calibration
Supplies:
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
• Calibration and quality control materials
1. DEFINITION
Chromium Occupational Exposure: Measurement of chromium levels
in urine to monitor exposure to chromium in occupational settings.
1. CALIBRATION AND QUALITY CONTROL
A) Calibration Preparation:
• Dilute the chromium standard solution to prepare a series of
calibration standards (e.g., 0, 1, 5, 10, 20 µg/L).
• Run the calibration standards on the ICP-MS to generate a
calibration curve.
B) Quality Control:
• Use certified urine quality control materials with known chromium
concentrations.
• Run QC samples at the beginning, middle, and end of each
analytical batch.
• Results must fall within the established QC range. If QC fails,
troubleshoot and resolve before proceeding.
1. PROCEDURE
A) Sample Preparation:
1. Homogenize the urine sample by inverting the container several
times.
2. Measure 5 mL of the urine sample and transfer it to a
polypropylene tube.
3. Add 0.5 mL of dilute nitric acid to the urine sample to stabilize it.
4. Vortex the sample for 30 seconds.
5. Centrifuge the sample at 1500 x g for 10 minutes to remove any
particulate matter.
B) Instrument Setup and Operation:
1. Ensure the ICP-MS is calibrated and ready for use according to
the manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Load the prepared urine samples, calibration standards, and
QC samples into the auto-sampler.
3. Set the ICP-MS to the appropriate analytical settings for
chromium detection.
C) Data Acquisition:
1. Initiate the sample run and monitor the ICP-MS for any alerts or
issues.
2. Ensure that each sample injection is completed, and data is
recorded.
D) Data Analysis:
1. Analyze the ICP-MS data using the calibration curve to quantify
chromium concentrations in each urine sample.
2. Verify that the instrument's performance and QC results are
within acceptable limits.
3. REPORTING RESULTS
A) Data Review:
• Review all generated data and ensure that standards, QC
samples, and blanks were properly analyzed and fall within
acceptable ranges.
• Any discrepancies or unusual results must be investigated and
resolved.
B) Result Documentation:
• Results will be automatically transmitted to the Laboratory
Information System (LIS) once reviewed.
• The reporting technologist must verify each result for accuracy
and completeness.
C) Reference Intervals:
• Occupational Exposure Chromium reference range: 0-10 µg/L.
• Results above the reference range must be flagged and brought
to the attention of the supervisor for further investigation and
appropriate reporting.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Interferences from other metals may affect the accuracy of
chromium detection.
• Ensure proper sample preparation and instrument calibration to
minimize potential sources of error.
• Refer to the ICP-MS manufacturer’s user manual for specific
limitations regarding the instrumentation.
