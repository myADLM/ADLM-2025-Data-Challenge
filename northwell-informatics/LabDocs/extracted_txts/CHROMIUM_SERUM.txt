Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase -
Determination of Chromium, Serum
1. PURPOSE
This procedure outlines the steps for the determination of serum
chromium using a specified analytical method. The purpose of this
SOP is to ensure the accurate and precise measurement of
chromium in serum samples, maintaining the integrity and reliability
of results.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of the trained laboratory personnel to carry out
chromium serum analysis according to these procedures.
Supervisors are responsible for ensuring that the procedures are
followed, necessary corrective actions are taken if deviations occur,
and all documentation is accurate and complete.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENT
Approved Specimen Type:
• Serum collected in a royal blue top (trace element) tube.
Specimen Handling:
• Serum must be separated from the cellular components within 2
hours of collection.
• Serum should be stored at 2-8°C if analysis is not performed
immediately and should not be stored for more than 48 hours
post-collection.
• For long-term storage, serum can be aliquoted and stored at
-20°C or lower.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
• Specimens collected in unapproved tubes or those outside the
specified temperature range and time frames.
1. REAGENTS, EQUIPMENT, AND SUPPLIES
3.1 Reagents:
• Deionized water (18 MΩ)
• Calibration standard solutions of chromium
• Quality control materials (high and low)
• Nitric acid, trace metal grade
• Matrix modifiers, if applicable
3.2 Equipment:
• Atomic Absorption Spectrometer (AAS) with graphite furnace or
Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS)
capable of trace element analysis
• Trace metal-free micro-sampling kits
• Laboratory glassware and plastic ware subjected to acid washing
to remove trace contaminants
3.3 Supplies:
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
• Water bath or heating block (if digestion of samples is required)
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes and tips (trace metal-free)
1. PROCEDURE
4.1 Calibration and Quality Control:
• Prepare calibration standards covering the expected range of
chromium concentrations in serum.
• Prepare and analyze quality control materials alongside patient
samples to ensure accuracy and precision.
• Refer to instrument manufacturer’s guidelines for detailed
instructions on calibration and QC set-up.
4.2 Sample Preparation:
• Thaw frozen serum samples at room temperature (if applicable).
• Vortex each sample gently to ensure homogeneity.
• If digestion is required, transfer 500 µL of serum sample to a trace
metal-free digestion tube, add 1 mL of nitric acid, heat at 95°C for
30 minutes, then dilute to a final volume with deionized water.
4.3 Instrument Analysis:
• Set up the atomic absorption spectrometer or ICP-MS according
to manufacturer’s guidelines specific to chromium analysis.
• Introduce calibration standards, blanks, quality control samples,
and patient specimens into the instrument in the appropriate
sequence.
• Ensure the measurement of the blank is consistent and within
acceptable limits before proceeding.
4.4 Data Collection and Analysis:
• Collect and record chromium concentrations from the instrument.
• Ensure all quality control samples fall within acceptable ranges. If
QC samples are out of range, troubleshoot according to
instrument guidelines and rerun affected samples.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
5.1 Results Review:
• Review all collected data to ensure no deviations occurred during
the analytical phase.
• Confirm that quality control results are within the established
tolerance limits.
• Perform repeat analyses for any out-of-control results or flagged
patient results.
5.2 Verification and Documentation:
• Manually verify the transfer of results to the Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
• Document all analysis steps, reagent lots, instrument
performance logs, and corrective actions taken.
5.3 Reference Intervals:
• Chromium reference intervals in serum: Adults: 0.12 – 2.1 µg/L
(These intervals can be adjusted per recent laboratorystandards
and literature evidence.)
1. QUALITY CONTROL
6.1 Internal QC:
• Analyze two levels of quality control material before and after the
patient samples. If QC is out of range, troubleshoot, and
reanalyze the affected samples.
6.2 External QC:
• Participate in external quality assurance programs to assess and
ensure analytical performance.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING
Refer to the following for common issues:
• Instrument manual for error codes and corresponding solutions.
• Calibration drift: Recalibrate the instrument and check sample
preparation methods.
• Matrix interferences: Use appropriate matrix modifiers or
alternative sample preparation techniques.
1. REFERENCES
Use the most current references and manufacturer's data sheet for
method-specific information.
Note: The laboratory director must review and approve all SOPs
before implementation. Any modifications to the SOP must be
documented and approved following laboratory quality system
requirements.
This protocol describes standard laboratory procedures for the
quantitative analysis of serum chromium levels, ensuring that results
are accurate and reliable. The SOP meets laboratory standards and
incorporates relevant quality assurance and control measures. If
further instrumentation details or current literature references are
required, these can be updated and specified according to the
laboratory’s current equipment and manuals.
