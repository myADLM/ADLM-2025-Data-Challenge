1. PURPOSE
To establish a standard operating procedure for the analysis,
generation, and reporting of chromium levels in synovial fluid
samples to ensure accurate, reliable, and timely results.
1. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel performing
chromium analysis on synovial fluid samples in a CLIA-certified
laboratory.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
All trained laboratory staff are responsible for adhering to this SOP. It
is the duty of the staff to complete the analysis accurately and report
any issues to the supervisor. The supervisor ensures staff
compliance and addresses any procedural discrepancies.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer (ICP-MS) or
Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer (AAS)
• Calibration standards for chromium
• Quality control materials
• Sample preparation supplies: centrifuge, pipettes, polypropylene
tubes, nitric acid, and diluent
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
• Laboratory Information System (LIS)
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENT AND STABILITY
• Specimen type: Synovial fluid
• Minimum volume: 1 mL
• Collection container: Sterile polypropylene tube
• Sample stability: Synovial fluid samples should be stored at 2-8°C
and analyzed within 24 hours. For longer storage, samples should
be frozen at -20°C.
1. PROCEDURE
6.1. Pre-Analysis
a. Verify that the sample has been properly collected, identified, and
accessioned. b. Inspect the sample for volume sufficiency and label
integrity. c. Record the sample information in the laboratory
information system (LIS).
6.2. Preparation of Standards and Quality Control
a. Prepare a series of calibration standards for chromium from a
certified stock solution. b. Prepare high and low concentration quality
control (QC) samples to validate the analytical run. c. Ensure all
standards and QC samples are within their expiry and stored
correctly.
6.3. Sample Preparation
a. Vortex the synovial fluid sample to ensure homogeneity. b. Pipette
a specified volume of the synovial fluid into a clean polypropylene
tube. c. Add an appropriate volume of nitric acid to the sample for
digestion and dilution. d. Centrifuge the sample to remove any
particulate matter.
6.4. Instrument Calibration
a. Perform a daily calibration check using the prepared chromium
standards. b. Calibrate the ICP-MS or AAS as per the manufacturer’s
instructions. c. Verify the calibration curve by analyzing quality control
samples.
6.5. Analysis
a. Load the prepared samples, standards, and QC samples into the
instrument. b. Begin the analysis sequence and monitor instrument
performance. c. Record observations, including any deviations or
anomalous results.
6.6. Post-Analysis
a. Review the data generated by the ICP-MS or AAS for accuracy
and precision. b. Validate the run by comparing QC results against
predetermined criteria. c. If QC results are within acceptable limits,
proceed to result generation. If not, troubleshoot and repeat the
analysis as necessary.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
a. Enter the validated chromium concentration results into the LIS. b.
Review all results for clinical significance and accuracy. c. Report any
flagged or critical values immediately to the attending physician or
designated medical personnel. d. Ensure all reported results include
the necessary interpretation and comments, as per the laboratory
protocol.
1. QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE
a. Perform QC checks with each analytical run. b. Document all QC
results in the QC log. c. Investigate and document any out-of-control
events, including corrective actions taken.
1. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS
a. Use appropriate PPE, including gloves and safety goggles when
handling samples and reagents. b. Follow the laboratory’s chemical
hygiene plan for handling and disposing of hazardous materials. c.
Ensure proper waste management protocols are followed.
1. REFERENCES
Refer to the manufacturer’s manual for the ICP-MS or AAS
instrument used for chromium analysis. Additionally, refer to the
laboratory quality management system (QMS) documents and any
relevant external guidelines.
1. DOCUMENTATION
All records of sample processing, instrument calibration, QC results,
and reports must be maintained according to laboratory policies and
be accessible for audit and review.
By following this standard operating procedure, laboratory personnel
ensure that the analysis and reporting of chromium in synovial fluid
are accurate, reliable, and timely, maintaining the highest standards
of laboratory practice.
