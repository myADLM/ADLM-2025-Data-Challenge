Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Chromogenic Factor IX
Activity Assay, Plasma
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for measuring the activity of Factor IX (FIX)
in plasma using a chromogenic assay to ensure accurate and
reproducible results.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all qualified laboratory personnel performing the
chromogenic Factor IX activity assay in the clinical laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITIES
It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory personnel to
perform and document the assay following this SOP. Supervisors are
responsible for verifying the results and ensuring quality control.
4. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
Equipment:
• Chromogenic Factor IX assay kit
• Calibrated micropipettes and tips
• Plate reader capable of reading at appropriate wavelength
(usually 405 nm)
• Centrifuge
• Timer
• Incubator (37°C)
Reagents:
• Chromogenic substrate specific for Factor IX
• Factor IX deficient plasma
• Calibration plasma with known Factor IX activity
• Control plasmas (normal and pathological levels)
• Dilution buffer
• Stop solution (if applicable)
5. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation:
1. Allow all reagents and plasma samples to reach room
temperature before use.
2. Set up the plate reader to the appropriate wavelength (usually
405 nm).
3. Label all necessary tubes, plates, and materials clearly.
4. Prepare the calibrators and controls according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
B. Calibration Curve Preparation:
1. Prepare a set of serial dilutions of the calibration plasma to
generate a standard curve.
2. Add the appropriate volumes of each calibrator dilution to the
designated wells of the microplate.
C. Sample Preparation:
1. Centrifuge patient plasma samples at 1500g for 15 minutes to
ensure platelet-poor plasma.
2. Dilute patient plasma samples in dilution buffer as specified by
the manufacturer (commonly 1:10 dilution).
3. Add the diluted patient plasma samples to the designated wells
of the microplate.
D. Assay Procedure:
1. Add an equal volume of Factor IX deficient plasma to each well
containing calibrators, controls, and patient samples.
2. Incubate the plate at 37°C for the time specified in the assay kit
instructions (commonly 5 minutes).
3. Add the chromogenic substrate to each well.
4. Incubate the plate again at 37°C for the appropriate time (as
specified by the manufacturer).
5. Add stop solution to each well if required by the assay protocol.
E. Reading and Calculation:
1. Measure the optical density (OD) of each well at 405 nm using
a plate reader.
2. Generate a standard curve by plotting the OD of the calibration
dilutions against their known concentrations.
3. Use the standard curve to determine the Factor IX activity in the
patient samples by comparing their OD readings to the curve.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Run both normal and abnormal control plasmas with each
batch of patient samples.
2. Ensure that control results fall within the acceptable range
specified by the manufacturer. If controls are out of range,
troubleshoot and repeat the assay.
3. Document all quality control results according to laboratory
policy.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Calculate the Factor IX activity for each patient sample using
the standard curve.
2. Record and verify the results in the laboratory information
system (LIS).
3. Report results according to site-specific reporting guidelines
and reference ranges.
8. REFERENCES
Manufacturer's assay kit insert and instructions.
9. DOCUMENTATION
Document all assay procedures, calibrations, quality control runs,
and patient results in the laboratory records as per institutional
guidelines.
10. TROUBLESHOOTING
Refer to the manufacturer's instructions for troubleshooting common
assay problems. Contact technical support if necessary for persistent
issues.
