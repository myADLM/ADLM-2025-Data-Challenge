Chromogenic Factor VIII Protocol
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this protocol is to provide a detailed procedure for
generating results for Chromogenic Factor VIII activity in the
laboratory. Chromogenic assays are used to measure the activity of
coagulation factors by using substrates that release a chromophore
upon cleavage by the factor of interest. Accurate determination of
Factor VIII activity is essential for diagnosing and monitoring
hemophilia A and other related bleeding disorders.
Responsibility: It is the responsibility of all designated laboratory
personnel to perform Chromogenic Factor VIII assays accurately and
document all findings meticulously. Laboratory managers and
supervisors are responsible for ensuring that all personnel are
adequately trained and that the assays comply with established
quality standards.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/acceptable specimen:
• Citrated plasma collected in a light blue top blood collection tube.
Unacceptable specimens:
• Specimens collected in non-citrated tubes.
• Specimens that are hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric.
• Specimens not labeled correctly or with discrepancies between
the collection time/date and the request form.
1. REAGENTS, EQUIPMENT, AND SUPPLIES
• Chromogenic Factor VIII reagent kit (store according to
manufacturer's specifications)
• Automated coagulometer or spectrophotometer capable of
measuring absorbance at the appropriate wavelength
• Controls (low, medium, and high levels specific for Factor VIII
activity)
• Calibrators
• Disposable cuvettes
• Pipettes and tips
• Plasma diluent
• Disposable gloves and lab coat
1. PROCEDURE
A) Pre-Analytical Phase:
• Ensure all specimens are properly labeled and match the patient
record.
• Inspect specimens for signs of hemolysis, lipemia, or icterus;
reject and document any unacceptable specimens.
• Allow specimens to reach room temperature if previously frozen.
B) Preparation of Reagents:
• Thaw all reagents and controls, if required.
• Prepare calibrators and controls according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
• Document preparation details, including lot numbers and
expiration dates.
C) Test Setup:
• Turn on the automated coagulometer or spectrophotometer and
perform an initial system check.
• Select the Chromogenic Factor VIII assay protocol on the
instrument.
• Pipette citrated plasma (patient sample, controls, and calibrators)
into the designated cuvettes.
• Add the chromogenic substrate and reagent as per the assay kit
instructions.
D) Assay Performance:
• Initiate the assay on the instrument according to manufacturer
specifications.
• Monitor the assay progression and absorbance reading at the
specified wavelength.
E) Calculation of Results:
• The instrument will automatically generate a standard curve from
the calibrators to calculate the Factor VIII activity in patient
samples.
• Ensure the standard curve is valid and within acceptable ranges.
Document and address any anomalies.
F) Quality Control:
• Run low, medium, and high control plasmas at the start and end
of each batch of patient samples.
• Ensure control values fall within the manufacturer-specified
ranges.
• Investigate and document any deviations from expected control
values.
G) Result Reporting:
• Review the results generated by the instrument.
• Compare patient results with reference ranges and validate
before reporting.
• Enter results into LIS for final review and verification.
H) Troubleshooting:
• If controls fall outside acceptable ranges, repeat the assay with
fresh reagents.
• Check for instrument errors or calibrator issues.
• Document any corrective actions taken and notify the laboratory
supervisor.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Normal Factor VIII activity: 50-150% of normal.
1. QUALITY CONTROL AND CALIBRATION
• All new reagent lots, calibrators, and controls must be verified
before use.
• Perform routine calibration checks, and document all QC
activities.
• Replace reagent kits approaching their expiration date and verify
results with new lots.
1. SAFETY MEASURES
• Wear gloves and lab coats while handling samples and reagents.
• Dispose of sharps and biological waste in proper containers
following laboratory safety protocols.
• Utilize biosafety cabinets if handling potentially infectious
specimens.
