Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Chromogenic Factor VIII
Activity Assay, Plasma
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for accurately and efficiently performing the
Chromogenic Factor VIII Activity Assay on plasma samples for
diagnostic assessment of factor VIII levels.
Responsibility:
• It is the responsibility of the performing technologist to ensure the
assay is conducted as per the protocol and that all pertinent
documentation is completed.
• It is the responsibility of the laboratory supervisor to ensure staff are
trained and proficient in this assay.
1. DEFINITION
The Chromogenic Factor VIII Activity Assay involves the
quantification of factor VIII activity in plasma, which is crucial in the
diagnosis and management of hemophilia A and other related
disorders.
1. PROCEDURE
3.1. Equipment and Reagents
• Chromogenic Factor VIII assay kits (ensure all reagents are within
expiry and stored at recommended temperatures) • Calibrated
pipettes and pipette tips • Microtiter plates • Plate reader (calibrated
and maintained) • Incubator set at 37°C • Timer • Quality control
samples (normal and abnormal control plasma) • Plasma calibrators
with known factor VIII concentrations
3.2. Specimen Requirements and Stability
• Plasma collected by venipuncture in trisodium citrate (blue top)
tubes:
• Preferred: Process within 4 hours of collection. If not possible,
freeze plasma at ≤-70°C.
• Unacceptable: Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric specimens.
Specimens more than 4 hours old and not properly frozen.
3.3. Preparation
• Thaw frozen plasma samples rapidly in a 37°C water bath, ensuring
minimal disturbance to thaw integrity. Mix gently to ensure
homogeneity. • Prepare and equilibrate reagents and quality controls
as specified by the kit manufacturer.
3.4. Calibration and Quality Control
• Run calibration curves using plasma calibrators provided with the
assay kit as per manufacturer instructions. • Perform assay validation
using normal and abnormal control plasmas.
• Validation Frequency: With each test batch or when new reagent
lots are used. • Document all calibration and quality control results
in the laboratory logbook.
3.5. Assay Procedure
1. Add the required volume of factor VIII-depleted plasma
substrate to each well of the microtiter plate.
2. Add control, calibrator, and plasma samples into respective
wells as per the manufacturer's guidelines.
3. Add chromogenic substrate and incubate the plate at 37°C for
10 minutes.
4. Simultaneously add factor Xa reagent and incubate for the
specified time.
5. Halt the reaction by adding a stopping reagent as per kit
protocol.
6. Measure optical density (OD) at the specified wavelength
(usually 405 nm) using a calibrated plate reader.
3.6. Calculation of Results
• Generate a standard curve using the OD readings from the plasma
calibrators. • Calculate factor VIII activity of the samples by
interpolating their OD readings against the standard curve. • Record
results as percentage of normal factor VIII activity.
3.7. Acceptance Criteria
• Ensure all control values fall within the manufacturer’s specified
range before accepting patient results. • Results are considered
acceptable when within ±15% of the expected value for control
samples.
3.8. Reporting Results
• Validate and review assay results before reporting. • Document
patient results in the laboratory information system (LIS). • Any
anomalous results must be repeated. Confirm any critical values with
a repeat assay.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If control values fall outside acceptable ranges, troubleshoot the
following potential issues:
• Reagent integrity
• Calibration curve discrepancies
• Equipment functionality
• Specimen integrity
• Repeat assays as necessary. Record any corrective steps taken in
the laboratory logbook.
1. SAMPLE ARCHIVING AND DISPOSAL
• Retain plasma samples at ≤-70°C for potential repeat testing. •
Dispose of biological waste and reagents according to biohazard
waste management protocols.

Note: This protocol must be reviewed periodically, and any changes
in assay kit, equipment, or regulatory guidance must be incorporated
timely.
