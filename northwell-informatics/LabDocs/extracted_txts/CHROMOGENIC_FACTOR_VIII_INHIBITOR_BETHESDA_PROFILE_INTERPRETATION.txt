Standard Operating Procedure: Chromogenic Factor
VIII Inhibitor Bethesda Profile Interpretation
1. PURPOSE
To provide a detailed procedure for the generation, documentation,
and interpretation of results for Chromogenic Factor VIII Inhibitor
Bethesda profile tests, ensuring accurate detection and quantification
of Factor VIII inhibitors in plasma samples.
2. SCOPE
This procedure is limited to the analytical phase of processing
chromogenic Factor VIII inhibitor tests and covers the steps required
for generating, interpreting, and reporting results.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Laboratory Technologist: Responsible for performing the test
and documenting observations and results.
• Supervisors: Ensure the adherence to assay protocols and
troubleshoot any issues.
• Quality Control Specialist: Regularly review the results and
related documentation to ensure accuracy and compliance with
standards.
4. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Chromogenic assay kit for Bethesda assay
• Calibrated microplate reader compatible with chromogenic assays
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Factor VIII standard and inhibitor control plasma
• Sample tubes and gloves
5. PROCEDURE
Sample Preparation
1. Specimen Requirements: • Preferred/acceptable: Citrated
plasma samples. • Unacceptable: Hemolyzed samples and
samples collected in anticoagulants other than citrate.
2. Storage: Store samples at -20°C if not processed immediately.
Ensure samples are thawed and brought to room temperature
before assay.
Chromogenic Factor VIII Inhibitor Assay
1. Reagent Preparation: • Follow the manufacturer's instructions
for the preparation of all reagents. • Do not use reagents past
expiry date.
2. Assay Setup: • Pipette 50µL of inhibitor control plasma and
patient plasma into individual wells of the microplate. • Add
50µL of Factor VIII solution to each well. • Incubate the
microplate at 37°C for 2 hours. • Add 50µL chromogenic
substrate to each well. • Measure absorbance at the specified
wavelength per the assay kit instructions.
3. Quality Control: • Include positive and negative controls in
each assay run. • Record control results and verify they are
within acceptable ranges before proceeding with sample
analysis.
Interpretation
1. Calculation: • Calculate the percentage inhibition of Factor VIII
activity using the formula provided in the assay kit. • Interpret
results based on the standard calibration curve.
2. Documentation: • Record patient ID, sample ID, and test
results in the laboratory information system (LIS). • Include any
observations or deviations from the protocol.
Troubleshooting
1. If controls fall outside acceptable ranges: • Review reagent
preparation and assay setup. • Repeat the assay. • Consult a
supervisor if issues persist.
Reporting Results
1. Result Verification: • Review results for any discrepancies. •
Verify and validate results in the LIS. • Ensure the results are
sent to the requesting physician.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform regular comparison checks between standard controls
and patient samples.
• Utilize external quality control materials and proficiency testing to
ensure assay accuracy.
