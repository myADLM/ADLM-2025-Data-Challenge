Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for CHROMOGENIC
FACTOR VIII INHIBITOR BETHESDA PROFILE, PLASMA
1. PURPOSE
To provide a comprehensive and standardized procedure for the
quantitation and confirmation of Factor VIII inhibitors in plasma using
the chromogenic Bethesda assay, ensuring accurate and reliable
results.
Responsibility:
Assigned laboratory technologists are responsible for performing the
Factor VIII Inhibitor Bethesda assay as per this protocol, including
documentation of results and corrective actions if necessary.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred Specimen: Citrated plasma collected in a 3.2% sodium
citrate tube.
• Specimen Volume: Minimum 1 mL of plasma required.
• Handling: Specimen must be centrifuged immediately at 1500 x g
for 15 minutes at room temperature, and the plasma separated
and frozen immediately at -70°C.
• Stability: Plasma samples are stable for up to 1 week when
stored at -70°C. Thaw rapidly prior to testing.
1. REAGENTS AND MATERIALS
• Chromogenic Factor VIII Assay Kit
• Calibrated micropipettes and tips
• 96-well microtiter plates
• Controlled-temperature water bath and incubator
• Plate reader capable of absorbance measurements at 405 nm
• Factor VIII standard plasma
• Factor VIII deficient plasma
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Use known positive and negative control samples with each
assay run.
• Controls should fall within established ranges; out-of-range results
necessitate investigation and corrective action prior to proceeding
with patient samples.
• Document all QC results in the QC log.
1. EQUIPMENT CALIBRATION AND MAINTENANCE
• Verify and document temperature settings and functionality of the
water bath and incubator daily.
• Perform routine calibration verification of pipettes monthly and
prior to the assay run if performance is questioned.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation
1. Thaw all reagents, controls, and patient plasma samples freshly
before setting up the assay.
2. Equilibrate all reagents and samples at room temperature
before use.
3. Prepare reagent mixtures and working solutions according to
the manufacturer's instructions in the Chromogenic Factor VIII
Assay Kit insert.
B. Assay Procedure
1. Sample Dilutions:
◦ Prepare serial dilutions of patient plasma in imidazole buffer
as per the Bethesda assay standard dilution scheme.
2. Factor VIII Incubation:
◦ Mix each plasma dilution with an equal volume of buffered
normal Factor VIII (typically 1:1) and incubate at 37°C for 2
hours.
3. Chromogenic Assay:
◦ After incubation, measure the residual Factor VIII activity in
each mixture using the chromogenic Factor VIII assay
procedure:
▪ Pipette 50 µL of each incubated mixture into the
microtiter plate wells.
▪ Add 50 µL of Factor VIII reagent and then 50 µL of
chromogenic substrate to each well.
▪ Incubate the plate at 37°C for 15 minutes.
▪ Add stop solution (50 µL) to terminate the reaction.
▪ Measure absorbance at 405 nm using a microplate
reader.
C. Calculation:
1. Calculate the residual Factor VIII activity from the standard
curve generated from the Factor VIII standard plasma.
2. Determine the inhibitor titer in Bethesda Units (BU) using the
formula provided in the kit insert: [ \text{BU/mL} = (\text{residual
activity of diluted plasma}/\text{normal control}) \times
\text{dilution factor} ]
D. Reporting Results:
1. Normalize patient results based on the average of two
determinations.
2. Report results below or above the standard acceptable range
with appropriate comments:
◦ Less than 0.6 BU/mL: No inhibitor detected.
◦ Between 0.6 - 5 BU/mL: Low inhibitory level detected.
◦ Greater than 5 BU/mL: High inhibitory level detected.
3. Ensure all results are reviewed, verified, and correctly
documented in the LIS.
4. REFERENCE INTERVALS:
• Normal range: ≤ 0.6 BU/mL
1. TROUBLESHOOTING:
• Review control results and raw data for any inconsistencies.
• If patient results are inconsistent or unexpected, repeat the assay
with fresh reagents.
• Consult the manufacturer’s troubleshooting guide or contact
technical support if persistent issues occur.

1. REVIEW AND DOCUMENTATION:
• Regularly review this SOP for updates in methodologies and
standards.
• Document all procedural deviations and corrective actions taken.
