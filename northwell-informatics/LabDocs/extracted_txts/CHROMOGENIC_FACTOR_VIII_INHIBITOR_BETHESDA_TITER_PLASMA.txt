Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Chromogenic Factor VIII Inhibitor
Bethesda Titer, Plasma
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this protocol is to provide standardized and detailed
procedures for the analytical phase of generating results for
Chromogenic Factor VIII Inhibitor Bethesda Titer in plasma samples.
This protocol ensures accurate and reliable testing, maintaining
consistency and high-quality results.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of all designated laboratory personnel to
perform and document all testing procedures accurately using this
SOP. Supervisors are responsible for ensuring all staff are properly
trained and for addressing any issues that may arise during testing.
1. DEFINITION
Chromogenic Factor VIII Inhibitor Bethesda Titer is a laboratory test
used to determine the presence and amount of Factor VIII inhibitors
in a plasma sample. These inhibitors can impede the function of
Factor VIII, which is crucial for blood clotting.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
• Specimen Type: Citrate plasma (collected in light blue-top tube)
• Volume: Minimum of 1 mL of plasma
• Specimen Handling: Centrifuge the specimen at 1500 x g for 15
minutes and carefully separate the plasma. Plasma should be
frozen at -20°C or colder if not tested immediately.
• Stability: Plasma samples are stable for up to 1 month when
stored at -20°C or colder.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Automated Factor VIII Chromogenic Assay Analyzer
• Factor VIII Deficient Plasma
• Control Plasma (normal and high inhibitor levels)
• Factor VIII Reagent Kit with chromogenic substrates and
calibrator
• Plate reader (appropriate wavelength)
• Micropipettes and pipette tips
• Vortex mixer
• Timer
• Laboratory-grade water
• Quality control materials
1. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Allow all reagents and plasma samples to come to room
temperature before use.
2. Follow manufacturer’s instructions to calibrate the analytical
equipment.
3. Prepare dilutions of patient plasma and control plasma in
Factor VIII deficient plasma as per manufacturer’s guidelines.
Assay Steps:
1. Factor VIII Activity Assay: a. Pipette the appropriate volume
of chromogenic substrate into each well of a microplate
according to the assay kit instructions. b. Add the calibrator,
control plasma, and diluted patient plasma to the respective
wells. c. Incubate the plate for the specified time and
temperature as per the reagent kit instructions (commonly 2-5
minutes at 37°C). d. Add the reagent containing Factor Xa and
allow the reaction to proceed for the specified time. e. Measure
absorbance at the specified wavelength using a plate reader.
2. Inhibitor Assay: a. Mix patient plasma with an equal volume of
normal control plasma. b. Incubate the mixture at 37°C for 2
hours (or as specified). c. Perform the Factor VIII activity assay
on the mixture. d. Determine the residual Factor VIII activity
using a standard curve.
3. Calculation of Bethesda Titer: a. Calculate the percentage of
residual Factor VIII activity in the patient sample. b. Use the
Bethesda Assay formula to determine the inhibitor titer: 1
Bethesda Unit (BU) corresponds to the amount of inhibitor that
destroys 50% of Factor VIII activity in the normal plasma under
assay conditions. c. Normalize the results to appropriate units
and compare with control values.
Quality Control:
1. Run the control plasma (with known inhibitor levels) alongside
patient samples to validate assay performance.
2. Repeat the assay if control results fall outside the acceptable
range or if there are significant discrepancies.
Recording Results:
1. Enter patient and control results into laboratory information
system (LIS).
2. Review and verify results for accuracy, ensuring all quality
control parameters are met.
Reporting:
1. Report the Bethesda Titer (BU) of the patient sample in the LIS.
2. Communicate any critical values to the responsible healthcare
provider immediately as per laboratory policy.
3. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Normal range: <0.6 BU
• Low-level inhibitor: 0.6 - 4.0 BU
• High-level inhibitor: >4.0 BU
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the manufacturer’s package insert for limitations of the
assay, potential interferences, and sources of error.
