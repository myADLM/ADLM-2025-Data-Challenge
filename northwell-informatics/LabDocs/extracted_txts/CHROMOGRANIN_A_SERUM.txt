Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Chromogranin A,
Serum Analysis
Purpose: To establish a standardized protocol for the analysis of
Chromogranin A in serum samples to ensure accuracy,
reproducibility, and traceability of results.
Responsibility: It is the responsibility of all designated laboratory
personnel to follow this protocol accurately and efficiently.
Supervisors must ensure that all staff are adequately trained and
adhere to this SOP.
Specimen Requirements:
• Preferred Collection: Collect blood into a plain red-top tube or
serum separator tube (SST).
• Specimen Stability: Serum specimens are stable for up to 48
hours at 2-8°C. For longer storage, samples can be frozen at
-20°C for up to 6 months.
• Unacceptable Specimens: Samples with hemolysis, lipemia, or
improper labeling will not be accepted for analysis.
Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies:
• Centrifuge
• Serum separator tubes (SST)
• Chromogranin A ELISA kit or standardized automated platform
(follow manufacturer instructions)
• Pipettes and tips
• Vortex mixer
• Reagent-grade water
• Calibrators and controls specific for Chromogranin A
• Microplate reader (if using ELISA kit)
Procedure:
Preparation of Serum Samples:
1. Centrifugation: Centrifuge the blood collection tube at
1500-2000 x g for 10 minutes at 4°C.
2. Serum Separation: Carefully transfer the serum into a clean
tube.
3. Freezing: If the sample will not be analyzed within 48 hours,
freeze the serum aliquots at -20°C.
Chromogranin A Analysis using ELISA:
1. Kit Preparation: Follow the instructions provided by the
manufacturer to prepare the Chromogranin A ELISA kit,
including reagent and calibrator preparation.
2. Sample Addition: Add the required volume of serum sample to
the designated wells of the ELISA plate.
3. Incubation: Incubate the plate according to the manufacturer’s
instructions (typically 1-2 hours at room temperature).
4. Washing: Wash the wells as instructed to remove unbound
substances.
5. Detection: Add the detection antibody and incubate for the
specified time.
6. Substrate Reaction: Add the substrate solution and incubate
until the color development is visible.
7. Reading: Measure the absorbance using a microplate reader
at the specified wavelength (usually 450 nm).
Quality Control:
1. External Controls: Run known positive and negative controls
along with patient samples.
2. Internal Quality Control: Ensure that the internal quality
controls provided in the kit meet the expected ranges before
validating any patient results.
3. Repeat Testing: If the controls do not yield acceptable results,
repeat the test and validate the kit performance before
reanalyzing patient samples.
Reporting Results:
1. Data Review: Review the absorbance values and generate a
standard curve from the calibrator readings.
2. Calculation: Calculate patient sample concentrations using the
standard curve.
3. Verification: Verify the calculated results for consistency and
correlation with control results.
4. Documentation: Document the results in the laboratory
information system (LIS).
Reference Intervals: Normal Chromogranin A serum levels range
from 0-100 ng/mL. Refer to the manufacturer’s guidelines for specific
reference intervals.
Method Limitations: Any sample that exhibits interference or falls
outside the dynamic range of the assay should be noted and
potentially retested.
