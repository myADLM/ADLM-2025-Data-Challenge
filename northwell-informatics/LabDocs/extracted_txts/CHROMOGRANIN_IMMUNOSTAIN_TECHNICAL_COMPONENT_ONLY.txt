Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
CHROMOGRANIN IMMUNOSTAIN, TECHNICAL COMPONENT
ONLY
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedures for the technical component of
chromogranin immunostaining in a CLIA-certified laboratory which
does not include pathologist interpretation. This protocol ensures
high-quality staining, reliability, and reproducibility, enabling
pathologists to make accurate diagnostic assessments based on the
staining results.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all technical staff involved in the
immunohistochemical staining of tissue sections for chromogranin. It
details the preparation, staining process, quality control, and
documentation.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the laboratory technologists and
histotechnologists to perform the chromogranin immunostain
procedure according to this SOP and document all steps accordingly.
Supervisors are responsible for ensuring adherence to the procedure
and addressing any deviations or issues that arise.

5. PROCEDURE
Pre-Staining Preparation:
1. Tissue Sectioning:
◦ Cut formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue
sections at 4 µm thickness using a microtome.
◦ Float sections on a water bath at ~40°C, then pick up onto
microscope slides.
◦ Dry slides in an oven at 60°C for 30-60 minutes.
2. Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
◦ Deparaffinize slides in xylene (3 changes, 5 minutes each).
◦ Rehydrate through graded alcohols (100%, 95%, 70%, and
water).
Immunohistochemical Staining:
1. Antigen Retrieval:
◦ Pre-heat antigen retrieval solution in a microwave or
pressure cooker.
◦ Immerse slides in the solution and heat according to
manufacturer’s instructions (typically 20 minutes).
◦ Allow slides to cool to room temperature (20-30 minutes).
◦ Wash slides in PBS or appropriate wash buffer (3 changes,
5 minutes each).
2. Blocking Endogenous Peroxidase:
◦ Incubate slides in peroxidase block solution for 10 minutes.
◦ Wash slides in PBS (2 changes, 5 minutes each).
3. Primary Antibody Incubation:
◦ Apply chromogranin antibody (diluted per manufacturer’s
instructions) to sections.
◦ Incubate in a humidity chamber at room temperature for 60
minutes.
◦ Wash slides in PBS (3 changes, 5 minutes each).
4. Secondary Antibody Incubation:
◦ Apply the secondary antibody conjugate to sections.
◦ Incubate for 30 minutes in a humidity chamber.
◦ Wash slides in PBS (3 changes, 5 minutes each).
5. Chromogen Development:
◦ Apply DAB substrate to sections for visualization.
◦ Incubate for 5-10 minutes, monitoring the development
under a microscope.
◦ Rinse slides in distilled water.
6. Counterstaining:
◦ Counterstain slides with hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes.
◦ Rinse in water and differentiate in acid alcohol if necessary.
◦ Blue in alkaline water (e.g., ammonia water, or tap water).
Post-Staining Procedure:
1. Dehydration and Mounting:
◦ Dehydrate through graded alcohols to xylene.
◦ Apply coverslip using mounting medium.
2. Quality Control:
◦ Check slides under a microscope for appropriate staining
intensity and background.
◦ Record observations in the Quality Control log.
3. Documentation:
◦ Document the staining procedure, including antibody lot
numbers, incubation times, and any deviations from the
SOP.
4. Storage:
◦ Store stained slides in a designated area, ready for
pathologist interpretation.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include positive and negative control slides with each batch of
staining.
• Ensure all reagents are within their expiration dates and properly
stored.
• Document all quality control procedures and observations in the
laboratory records.
• Report any inconsistencies or issues to a supervisor immediately.
7. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's instructions for antibodies, detection kits, and
reagents.
• Laboratory quality assurance guidelines.
8. SAFETY
• Follow laboratory safety protocols for handling biological
specimens and hazardous chemicals.
• Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) at all
times.
This SOP is reviewed and updated annually or as needed to reflect
new technology or procedures.
