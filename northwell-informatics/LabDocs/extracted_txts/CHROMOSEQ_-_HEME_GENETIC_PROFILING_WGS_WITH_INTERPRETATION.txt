STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP)
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the analytical phase steps for
generating results for CHROMOSEQ - HEME GENETIC PROFILING
(Whole Genome Sequencing - WGS) with interpretation, ensuring
consistent quality and accuracy of results in accordance with CLIA-
certified laboratory standards.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory staff involved in the analysis and
interpretation of genetic profiling for hematologic disorders using
Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS).
3. RESPONSIBILITIES
• Laboratory Technologists: Responsible for performing and
documenting all steps in the WGS process, including sequencing,
quality control, data analysis, and initial data interpretation.
• Bioinformaticians: Responsible for data processing, variant
calling, and advanced bioinformatics analyses.
• Geneticists/Pathologists: Responsible for the final interpretation
of results and clinical reporting.
4. DEFINITIONS
• CHROMOSEQ: A comprehensive genetic profiling assay that
utilizes Whole Genome Sequencing for the detection of
hematologic malignancies.
• WGS: Whole Genome Sequencing, a method for sequencing all
the DNA in a genome.
• Variant Calling: The process of identifying variants from
sequence data.
5. PROCEDURE
A. Pre-Analytical Verification:
1. Sample Check-in: Ensure that the specimen received matches
the patient information and requisition. Verify that it is properly
labelled and has been accessioned according to laboratory
protocols.
2. DNA Extraction: If not already completed, extract DNA using a
validated DNA extraction method. Quantify and assess the
quality of the DNA using spectrophotometry and fluorometry.
B. Library Preparation and Sequencing:
1. Library Preparation:
◦ Follow the validated protocol for preparing sequencing
libraries from the extracted DNA.
◦ Perform quality control checks on the libraries using
appropriate methods (e.g., Bioanalyzer, Qubit).
◦ Ensure that library preparation and QC steps are recorded
and documented.
2. Sequencing:
◦ Load the prepared libraries onto the sequencer following the
manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Initiate the sequencing run and ensure the proper run setup,
including appropriate run parameters.
◦ Monitor the sequencing run for any technical issues and
document any deviations from the standard procedure.
C. Data Analysis:
1. Data Quality Control:
◦ Assess the raw sequencing data quality using established
bioinformatics tools (e.g., FASTQC).
◦ Ensure that the sequencing data meets the minimum quality
thresholds (e.g., Phred score ≥ Q30, adequate coverage
depth).
2. Alignment and Variant Calling:
◦ Align the sequencing reads to the human reference genome
(GRCh38 or the latest version) using a validated alignment
tool (e.g., BWA, Bowtie2).
◦ Perform variant calling using established algorithms (e.g.,
GATK, FreeBayes) to identify single nucleotide variants
(SNVs), insertions, deletions (indels), copy number
variations (CNVs), and structural variations (SVs).
◦ Filter and annotate the variants using appropriate databases
(e.g., ClinVar, COSMIC, dbSNP).
3. Primary Data Interpretation:
◦ Generate preliminary variant interpretation reports focusing
on clinically relevant variants.
◦ Incorporate additional analyses as necessary (e.g.,
karyotyping, translocations).
D. Variant Interpretation and Reporting:
1. Clinical Interpretation:
◦ Review the identified variants for clinical significance
following established guidelines (e.g., ACMG guidelines).
◦ Correlate the findings with the patient’s clinical information
and medical history.
◦ Generate a comprehensive clinical report that includes the
interpretation of findings, potential implications for diagnosis,
prognosis, and recommended follow-up actions.
2. Report Review and Validation:
◦ The clinical report must be reviewed and validated by a
certified geneticist or pathologist.
◦ Ensure that the final report is accurate, clear, and compliant
with regulatory standards.
3. Result Documentation:
◦ Document all variant findings, interpretations, and clinical
recommendations in the laboratory information system
(LIS).
◦ Ensure the proper transmission of the final report to the
requesting clinician.
E. Quality Control and Assurance:
1. Internal Quality Control:
◦ Run known control samples periodically to ensure the
accuracy and precision of the sequencing and analytical
workflow.
◦ Document and address any deviations from acceptable QC
metrics.
2. Proficiency Testing:
◦ Participate in external proficiency testing programs and
document performance results.
◦ Implement corrective actions for any identified deficiencies.
