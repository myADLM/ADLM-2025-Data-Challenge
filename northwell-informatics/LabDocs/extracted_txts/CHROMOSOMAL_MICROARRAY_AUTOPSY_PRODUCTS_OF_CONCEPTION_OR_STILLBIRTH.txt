Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase Protocol for Chromosomal Microarray Analysis
for Autopsy, Products of Conception, or Stillbirth
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this protocol is to outline the
procedures for the chromosomal microarray analysis of
samples from autopsies, products of conception (POC), or
stillbirths to ensure accurate and reliable results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY It is the responsibility of the designated
laboratory personnel to follow this SOP and ensure the
accuracy and integrity of the results.
3. SCOPE This SOP applies to all chromosomal microarray
analyses performed on samples derived from autopsies,
products of conception, or stillbirths in this laboratory.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Types:
• Tissue specimen: Fresh frozen tissue or formalin-fixed, paraffin-
embedded (FFPE) tissue
• Amniotic fluid or chorionic villi: Fresh or frozen
• Peripheral blood sample from fetus or parents: Collected in EDTA
tubes
Specimen Handling:
• All tissue specimens must be handled with care to avoid
contamination and preserve DNA integrity.
• Specimens should be transported and stored at appropriate
temperatures (refrigerated for fresh, room temperature for FFPE).
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Chromosomal microarray platform (e.g., Affymetrix, Agilent)
• Nucleic acid extraction kits
• Quantification tools (e.g., spectrophotometer, Qubit fluorometer)
• Lab-grade water and buffers
• Microarray hybridization reagents
• Microarray scanner
1. PROCEDURE
A) DNA Extraction:
1. Fresh tissue:
◦ Carefully dissect and obtain a tissue sample (~50 mg).
Minimize blood and necrotic material.
◦ Use a validated tissue DNA extraction kit. Follow the
manufacturer’s protocol for extraction.
◦ Quantify the DNA yield and assess purity (A260/A280 ratio).
2. FFPE tissue:
◦ Using a microtome, obtain sections (8-10 µm thick) from the
paraffin block.
◦ Use a validated FFPE DNA extraction kit. Follow the
manufacturer’s protocol for deparaffinization and extraction.
◦ Quantify the DNA yield and assess purity.
3. Peripheral blood:
◦ Refrigerate the collected blood in EDTA tubes until
processing.
◦ Extract DNA using a validated blood DNA extraction kit.
◦ Quantify the DNA yield and assess purity.
B) DNA Quality Check:
• Ensure DNA concentration meets the requirements for microarray
analysis (typically > 50 ng/µL).
• Assess DNA quality using gel electrophoresis for integrity.
C) Microarray Preparation:
1. Labeling:
◦ Label the DNA as per the microarray platform specifications
using appropriate labeling kits.
◦ Assess labeling efficiency by measuring dye incorporation.
2. Hybridization:
◦ Prepare the labeled DNA for hybridization according to the
microarray platform instructions.
◦ Load the labeled DNA onto the microarray slide and
hybridize under appropriate conditions (e.g., 65°C for 16-24
hours).
D) Microarray Washing and Scanning:
• Wash the hybridized slides using the recommended wash buffers
to remove unbound DNA.
• Dry the slides by centrifugation or air-drying.
• Scan the slides using a microarray scanner to generate
fluorescence intensity data.
E) Data Analysis:
1. Data Extraction
◦ Use microarray software to extract raw data and perform
quality control checks on hybridization efficiency.
2. Data Normalization
◦ Normalize the data to correct for any systematic biases or
background noise.
3. Analysis
◦ Perform copy number variation (CNV) analysis using
specialized software (e.g., ChAS, Genomic Suite).
◦ Compare results to a reference genome and identify
significant chromosomal abnormalities.
◦ Confirm findings through secondary validation, such as
quantitative PCR or Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization
(FISH), if necessary.
4. REPORTING RESULTS:
• Compile and interpret the analyzed data.
• Communicate findings in a clear and concise report, including:
◦ Interpretation of the identified chromosomal abnormalities
◦ Any relevant details regarding the sample type and condition
◦ Recommendations for further testing if necessary
1. QUALITY CONTROL:
• Ensure that all reagents and equipment are regularly calibrated
and maintained.
• Run internal quality controls (e.g., samples with known CNVs)
alongside patient samples to ensure accuracy.
• Document all quality control activities, including deviations and
corrective measures taken.
1. REFERENCES:
• Specific microarray platform manuals and manufacturer protocols.
• Relevant clinical guidelines for chromosomal microarray analysis
in POC, stillbirth, and autopsy samples.
1. SAFETY:
• Follow all laboratory safety protocols for handling and disposing of
biological materials.
• Use personal protective equipment (PPE) as required.
This SOP intends to maintain high standards in the analysis and
reporting of chromosomal microarray results, ensuring the reliable
and accurate detection of chromosomal abnormalities in autopsy,
products of conception, and stillbirth cases.
