Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Chromosomal
Microarray Analysis
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this document is to outline the procedure for
performing chromosomal microarray analysis on tissue samples from
autopsy, products of conception, or stillbirth. This procedure ensures
consistency, reliability, and compliance with best practices and
regulations.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of designated laboratory staff to perform
chromosomal microarray analysis and ensure the accuracy and
validity of test results. All personnel must follow this SOP exactly as
written.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
Spacial Requirements:
• Tissue samples: placental tissue, umbilical cord, fetal tissue, or
other relevant specimens should be collected in a sterile manner.
• The specimen must be stored at a temperature between 2-8°C
and transported quickly to the laboratory.
• The specimen should not be frozen as this can degrade DNA
quality.
• Ensure that the sample tube is properly labeled with the patient’s
identification, including name, date of birth, and any other
applicable identifiers.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens without proper labeling.
• Specimens that are not transported under required conditions.
• Specimens with insufficient quantity or poor integrity that could
compromise DNA extraction.
4. MATERIALS AND REAGENTS
Equipment:
• Microarray scanner
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Microcentrifuge tubes
• Thermal cycler
• Vortex mixer
Reagents:
• DNA extraction kit
• Microarray hybridization kit
• Labelling and amplification reagents
• Wash buffers
5. PROCEDURE
A. DNA Extraction:
1. Sample Preparation:
◦ Place tissue sample in a sterile microcentrifuge tube.
◦ Add appropriate lysis buffer (as per DNA extraction kit
protocols).
2. Tissue Lysis:
◦ Homogenize tissue using a suitable homogenizer or
manually by scalpel.
◦ Incubate with proteinase K at 56°C until the tissue is
completely lysed.
3. DNA Purification:
◦ Follow the instructions provided in the DNA extraction kit for
column-based or magnetic bead-based purification.
◦ Elute DNA in a suitable volume of elution buffer or nuclease-
free water.
4. Quality Control:
◦ Measure DNA concentration and purity using a
spectrophotometer and/or fluorometer (e.g., NanoDrop).
B. DNA Labelling and Amplification:
1. Labelling:
◦ Prepare DNA labelling reaction mix with required reagents
from the labelling kit.
◦ Incubate according to manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Amplification:
◦ Use an appropriate amplification kit.
◦ Follow thermal cycling conditions as specified in the kit
manual.
C. Hybridization:
1. Pre-Hybridization:
◦ Denature labelled DNA by heating at 95°C for 5 minutes,
followed by a quick chill on ice.
2. Hybridization:
◦ Load labeled DNA onto the microarray slide.
◦ Hybridize using a hybridization oven or chamber at
recommended temperature (e.g., 42°C) for 16-24 hours.
D. Washing and Scanning:
1. Washing:
◦ Wash microarray slides using wash buffers to remove non-
specific binding.
◦ Carefully follow instructions in the hybridization kit regarding
buffer compositions and washing protocols.
2. Scanning:
◦ Dry the slide and then scan using a microarray scanner.
◦ Save the raw image data for analysis.
E. Data Analysis:
1. Image Processing:
◦ Process raw microarray images using proprietary/validated
software.
◦ Normalize data to minimize technical variability and
background noise.
2. Data Interpretation:
◦ Analyze the data to identify copy number variations (CNVs)
and regions of loss of heterozygosity (LOH).
◦ Use appropriate analysis software complying with laboratory
standards.
6. QUALITY CONTROL AND PERFORMANCE MONITORING
• Utilize control DNA samples in parallel with patient samples to
monitor assay performance.
• Verify that quality control criteria (e.g., signal intensity, background
noise) as per manufacturer’s guidelines are met in all runs.
• Perform a bi-annual proficiency test involving blind samples as
part of a quality assurance program.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
• Review raw and analyzed data to ensure consistency and
accuracy.
• Generate a report summarizing findings including the identified
regions of CNVs, significance, and clinical implications.
• Ensure results are reviewed by a qualified laboratory geneticist or
pathologist prior to reporting.
8. RECORD KEEPING AND DOCUMENTATION
• Retain records of all analysis including raw data, processed data,
QC results, and final reports for a minimum of 10 years or as
required by relevant regulations.
• Log deviations or anomalies encountered during analysis and any
corrective actions undertaken.
9. REFERENCES
• Refer to the manufacturer’s instructions for the DNA extraction,
labelling, hybridization, and analysis kits used.
• Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines on
microarray analysis.
• Relevant scientific literature and best practice guidelines on
chromosomal microarray technology.
10. REVIEW AND REVISION
• This SOP will be reviewed annually for accuracy and relevance.
Required amendments will be incorporated as necessary.
