Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Chromosomal
Microarray (CMA) Familial Testing
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedures for conducting Chromosomal Microarray
(CMA) familial testing using Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization
(FISH) techniques to ensure accuracy and reliability of results.
Responsibility:
Designated staff members are responsible for performing
Chromosomal Microarray analysis and FISH according to the
procedures outlined in this SOP. It is the responsibility of all staff to
identify any deficiencies that may affect laboratory test results and
bring them to the attention of a supervisor.
1. DEFINITION
Chromosomal Microarray Analysis (CMA) Familial Testing is utilized
to evaluate chromosomal abnormalities that may have implications
for familial genetic disorders. FISH is a cytogenetic technique used
within this scope to identify specific DNA sequences on
chromosomes.
Target tolerance limits:
No defined tolerance limits for FISH techniques; results are analyzed
qualitatively and quantitatively based on prepared samples.
1. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation of Specimen
1. Specimen Type and Collection:
◦ Acceptable specimens include peripheral blood, bone
marrow, amniotic fluid, and chorionic villi.
◦ Ensure specimens are collected in sterile conditions.
Peripheral blood should be collected in EDTA or heparin
tubes.
2. Processing the Specimen:
◦ Upon receipt, specimen integrity must be verified.
◦ Separate lymphocytes from whole blood using density
gradient centrifugation, if applicable.
◦ Specimens must be stored at 4°C and processed within the
same day to maintain cellular viability.
3. Culture Setup:
◦ If necessary, set up short-term culture using RPMI-1640
medium supplemented with fetal bovine serum and
antibiotics.
◦ Incubate cultures at 37°C with 5% CO₂ for up to 72 hours.
B) Chromosomal Microarray Analysis
1. DNA Extraction:
◦ Extract DNA from collected specimens using a standardized
DNA extraction protocol.
◦ Evaluate the quality and quantity of extracted DNA using
spectrophotometry and gel electrophoresis.
2. Microarray Hybridization:
◦ Label extracted DNA samples with fluorophores appropriate
for microarray hybridization.
◦ Hybridize labeled DNA onto the chromosomal microarray
slide following manufacturer’s protocol.
3. Data Collection & Analysis:
◦ Scan the hybridized microarray using an automated
scanner.
◦ Utilize microarray analysis software to identify chromosomal
copy number variations (CNVs) and regions of
homozygosity.
◦ Compare identified CNVs with familial controls and
reference databases.
C) Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH)
1. Probe Preparation:
◦ Select appropriate FISH probes targeting specific
chromosomal regions of interest.
◦ Prepare probes according to manufacturer’s instructions,
ensuring proper dilution and mixing.
2. Slide Preparation:
◦ Apply specimen cells onto microscope slides.
◦ Fix slides using methanol-acetic acid solution and air dry.
3. Hybridization:
◦ Denature specimen DNA and FISH probe DNA
simultaneously.
◦ Hybridize probes to denatured specimen DNA on slides in a
humid chamber overnight.
4. Washing and Staining:
◦ Wash slides to remove unbound probes using a series of
stringent washes.
◦ Counterstain slides with DAPI or another suitable nuclear
stain.
5. Microscopy:
◦ Analyze slides under fluorescence microscope.
◦ Evaluate specific binding patterns of probes, and compare
these with familial controls.
D) Documentation and Reporting
1. Logging Results:
◦ Document all findings in the Chromosomal Microarray and
FISH Test Log, including specimen details, hybridization
results, and analysis data.
2. Interpreting Results:
◦ Interpret CNVs and probe binding patterns in the context of
familial history and genetic significance.
◦ Discuss any ambiguous or novel findings with genetic
specialists for further expert analysis.
3. Report Generation:
◦ Generate a comprehensive report summarizing test results,
interpretation, and recommendations.
◦ Ensure all reports are reviewed and verified by a
supervising technologist before release.
Quality Control:
• Include positive and negative controls in each CMA and FISH run.
• Perform regular calibration and maintenance of equipment to
ensure optimal performance.
• Cross-check analysis results with previous familial data to ensure
consistency.

databases for updated interpretation standards.
Record Keeping and Review Process
• Store all data electronically and ensure periodic backup.
• Review SOP annually or as required to incorporate latest
advancements and compliance requirements.
