Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
1. PURPOSE
This procedure outlines the analytical phase of generating results for
Chromosomal Microarray (CMA) testing using blood specimens for
the detection of copy number variations (CNVs) and other
chromosomal alterations associated with congenital disorders.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated personnel are responsible for following the outlined
procedures to ensure accurate and timely processing and analysis of
CMA tests. It is the responsibility of all staff to identify and report any
deficiencies in the analytical phase and bring them to the attention of
a supervisor.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred Specimen:
• Peripheral blood
• Collected in an EDTA (lavender top) tube
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Blood specimens collected in non-EDTA tubes
• Hemolyzed specimens
• Blood specimens received more than 72 hours after collection
Specimen Stability:
• Blood specimens can be stored at 4°C and should be processed
within 72 hours of collection.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• DNA extraction kit (e.g., QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit)
• Chromosomal microarray platform (e.g., Affymetrix CytoScan HD)
• Microarray scanner (e.g., Affymetrix Scanner 3000)
• Laboratory Information System (LIS)
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes and tips
• PCR thermocycler
• Agarose gel electrophoresis setup
• NanoDrop spectrophotometer
1. PROCEDURE
A) DNA Extraction:
1. Receive and accession blood specimens in the laboratory.
2. Centrifuge blood at 2000 rpm for 10 minutes to separate the
plasma.
3. Use the DNA extraction kit to isolate DNA from the buffy coat
according to the manufacturer's instructions.
4. Measure DNA concentration using the NanoDrop
spectrophotometer and assess purity (A260/A280 ratio).
5. Store the extracted DNA at -20°C until further use.
B) DNA Preparation and Labeling:
1. Quantify the extracted DNA accurately and normalize the
concentrations.
2. Fragment the DNA using a restriction enzyme as per the
microarray platform instructions.
3. Label the fragmented DNA with fluorescence dyes using the
appropriate labeling kit.
4. Purify the labeled DNA to remove excess dyes and salts.
C) Hybridization:
1. Prepare the microarray chip as per the manufacturer's
instructions.
2. Hybridize the labeled DNA onto the microarray chip in a
hybridization oven at the specified temperature and time.
3. Wash the chips to remove unbound DNA and dyes.
D) Scanning and Data Analysis:
1. Scan the microarray chip using the microarray scanner
according to the manufacturer's protocols.
2. Import the scanned images into the analysis software provided
by the microarray platform (e.g., Chromosome Analysis Suite).
3. Perform data analysis to identify CNVs and other chromosomal
alterations.
4. Review the generated data for quality control metrics and verify
the presence of significant findings.
E) Validation and Reporting:
1. Validate the results using internal quality control standards.
2. Document the findings in the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
3. Interpret the results and draft a comprehensive report including
identified CNVs and their clinical significance.
4. Review and sign-off the report by a qualified laboratory
geneticist.
5. Release the final report to the ordering physician.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform routine maintenance and calibration of equipment used in
the process.
• Analyze known control samples with each batch of specimens to
ensure assay accuracy.
• Follow manufacturer guidelines for internal quality controls on all
reagents and equipment.
• Document all quality control measures and corrective actions in
the LIS.
