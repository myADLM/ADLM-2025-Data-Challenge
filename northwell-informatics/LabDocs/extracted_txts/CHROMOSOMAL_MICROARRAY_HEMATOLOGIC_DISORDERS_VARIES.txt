Standard Operating Procedure
(SOP): Chromosomal
Microarray for Hematologic
Disorders
1. PURPOSE
To describe the procedures for analysis, interpretation, and reporting
of chromosomal microarray (CMA) results in the context of
hematologic disorders to ensure consistent, accurate, and timely
results.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all technologists and staff conducting
chromosomal microarray analysis for hematologic disorders,
including but not limited to leukemia, lymphoma, and other related
conditions.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Laboratory Directors and Supervisors: Ensure overall protocol
adherence and compliance with CLIA regulations.
• Molecular Technologists: Perform the chromosomal microarray
analysis as outlined in this SOP and ensure quality control.
• Reporting Staff: Ensure accurate documentation and
interpretation of results.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENT AND
STORAGE
• Specimen Type: Peripheral blood, bone marrow aspirate, or
other relevant hematologic samples.
• Volume: Minimum 3 mL whole blood collected in EDTA tubes or
equivalent.
• Stability: Specimens should be processed within 24-48 hours of
collection for optimal results.
• Storage: Specimens should be stored at 2-8°C if not processed
immediately.
5. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Chromosomal Microarray Scanner
• Microarray slides specific for hematologic disorders
• Labeling reagents
• Hybridization buffers
• Wash solutions
• Quality control reagents
• Analysis software
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
6. PROCEDURE
6.1 Pre-Analytical Phase
1. Specimen Verification:
◦ Verify the identification and integrity of specimens upon
receipt.
◦ Accession the specimens and log them into the laboratory
information system (LIS).
2. DNA Extraction:
◦ Extract genomic DNA from the specimen using validated
protocols.
◦ Quantify and assess the quality of DNA using
spectrophotometry or fluorometry methods.
6.2 Analytical Phase
1. DNA Labeling:
◦ Label genomic DNA with appropriate fluorescent dyes
according to manufacturer's instructions.
2. Hybridization:
◦ Prepare the hybridization mix including labeled DNA, control
DNA, and hybridization buffer.
◦ Apply the mixture to microarray slides, cover with coverslips,
and incubate in a hybridization chamber.
◦ Follow the specific time and temperature conditions
provided in the array kit manual.
3. Washing:
◦ Wash the microarray slides to remove unbound DNA and
minimize background noise.
4. Scanning:
◦ Scan the microarray slides using a chromosomal microarray
scanner.
◦ Ensure the scanner settings and parameters are aligned
with the manufacturer’s guidelines.
6.3 Post-Analytical Phase
1. Data Analysis:
◦ Import the scanned images into the analysis software.
◦ Perform initial quality control checks to ensure data integrity.
◦ Analyze the data to identify chromosomal gains, losses, and
copy number variations (CNVs) relevant to hematologic
disorders.
2. Interpretation:
◦ Compare the findings with reference databases and
literature.
◦ Interpret the clinical significance of identified CNVs and their
relevance to the diagnosed hematologic disorder.
3. Reporting:
◦ Generate a comprehensive report including a detailed
description of findings, interpretation, and clinical
significance.
◦ Review and verify the report as per laboratory standards.
◦ Ensure that the final report is authorized by a qualified
professional before release.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Internal Controls:
◦ Include positive and negative controls in each batch of
analysis.
◦ Monitor assay performance and troubleshoot any
deviations.
2. Proficiency Testing:
◦ Participate in external proficiency testing programs to
ensure competence and accuracy.
3. Documentation:
◦ Maintain thorough records of all steps, results, and quality
control measures.
◦ Document any deviations or corrective actions taken.
8. TROUBLESHOOTING
Refer to the manufacturer’s manual for common issues and their
resolutions. For unresolved issues, consult the laboratory director or
technical support.
