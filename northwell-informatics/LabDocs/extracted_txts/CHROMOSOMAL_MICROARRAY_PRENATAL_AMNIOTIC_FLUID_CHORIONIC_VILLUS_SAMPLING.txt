Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Chromosomal Microarray Analysis for Prenatal Amniotic Fluid/
Chorionic Villus Sampling
Purpose:
To provide standardized procedures for performing chromosomal
microarray analysis (CMA) on prenatal amniotic fluid or chorionic
villus sampling (CVS) samples to detect potential chromosomal
abnormalities.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of the laboratory technologists performing the
microarray analysis to ensure that the procedures are performed
accurately and according to protocol. The laboratory supervisor is
responsible for overseeing the quality control and troubleshooting
any issues that arise during the process.
Specimen Collection and Transport:
1. Preferred Specimens:
◦ Amniotic fluid: 15-20 mL collected in sterile containers.
◦ Chorionic villus sampling: 5-10 mg collected in a sterile
container with culture medium.
2. Specimen Handling:
◦ Transport specimens to the laboratory immediately. If there
is a delay, store specimens at 2-8°C but do not freeze.
3. Unacceptable Specimens:
◦ Specimens not transported or stored as per guidelines.
◦ Specimens collected in containers other than those
specified.
◦ Contaminated or clotted samples.
Equipment and Reagents:
• Genomic DNA extraction kit
• Microarray platform specific to the laboratory (e.g., Affymetrix,
Agilent, Illumina)
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• PCR machines
• Hybridization station
• Scanner for microarray analysis
• Sterile centrifuge tubes
• Nuclease-free water
• Ethanol
• Incubator
Procedure:
1. Specimen Preparation:
◦ Verify and document the sample’s identity and integrity.
◦ Isolate genomic DNA from the amniotic fluid or CVS sample
using a genomic DNA extraction kit according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
◦ Quantify DNA concentration and quality using a
spectrophotometer or fluorometer.
2. DNA Labelling and Amplification:
◦ Label DNA with fluorescent dyes as per the microarray
manufacturer’s protocol.
◦ Perform amplification reactions (if required) according to the
specific microarray protocol.
◦ Purify labelled DNA using the recommended purification
protocol.
3. Hybridization:
◦ Prepare hybridization mixtures following the microarray
manufacturer’s guidelines.
◦ Apply the hybridization mixture to the microarray slide.
◦ Incubate the microarray slide in the hybridization station
under optimal conditions to ensure proper hybridization.
4. Washing and Scanning:
◦ Wash the microarray slide to remove non-hybridized probes
using the microarray manufacturer’s protocol.
◦ Dry the microarray slide to prepare for scanning.
◦ Scan the microarray slide using a microarray scanner and
collect fluorescence data.
5. Data Analysis:
◦ Use the designated software to analyze the scanned
microarray data.
◦ Evaluate the data for copy number variations (CNVs) and
other chromosomal abnormalities using bioinformatics tools
and databases.
◦ Perform quality control checks to ensure the reliability of the
results.
6. Interpretation and Reporting:
◦ Interpret the results in the context of the patient's clinical
information.
◦ Prepare a comprehensive report detailing the findings,
including detected CNVs and their clinical significance.
◦ Have the report reviewed and signed by a qualified clinical
cytogeneticist or geneticist.
Quality Control:
1. Use controls (positive and negative) to ensure the accuracy and
precision of the microarray analysis.
2. Perform periodic external validation and participate in
proficiency testing programs to maintain high standards.
3. Record and monitor data from controls and standards to identify
and correct any deviations.
Troubleshooting:
1. If issues arise during any step of the protocol, troubleshoot
based on manufacturer’s guidelines and laboratory standard
procedures.
2. Document any non-conformances and corrective actions taken
to resolve the issues.

Review Cycle: This SOP should be reviewed annually or as new
updates become available in protocols or equipment used.
