STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP)
Title: Chromosomal Microarray Analysis (CMA) for Tumor Samples
from Formalin-Fixed Paraffin-Embedded (FFPE) Tissue
1. PURPOSE
The objective of this SOP is to provide a detailed protocol for the
analytical phase of generating chromosomal microarray (CMA)
results for tumor samples obtained from formalin-fixed paraffin-
embedded (FFPE) tissue.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to the test analysts and all other relevant
personnel involved in the preparation, processing, and analysis of
FFPE tumor samples for CMA in the laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of designated laboratory personnel to adhere to
this SOP, ensuring that the samples are processed and analyzed
according to the defined procedures. Supervisors are responsible for
ensuring compliance and addressing any deviations or issues that
may arise.
4. DEFINITION
Chromosomal Microarray (CMA) - A molecular technique used to
detect chromosomal imbalances at a high resolution using DNA
extracted from FFPE tumor samples.
5. EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS
• FFPE tumor tissue blocks
• Microtome
• Xylene
• Ethanol (70%, 80%, 95%, and 100%)
• Qiagen FFPE DNA extraction kit (or equivalent)
• Nanodrop spectrophotometer (or equivalent)
• Qubit fluorometer (or equivalent)
• Chromosomal microarray platform (e.g., Affymetrix, Agilent)
• Hybridization oven
• Centrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Clean bench
• Laboratory consumables (tubes, microcentrifuge tubes, etc.)
• Laboratory information management system (LIMS)
6. PROCEDURE
6.1. Sample Preparation
1. Retrieve the FFPE tumor blocks from storage.
2. Cut 5-10 micron sections using a microtome. Place sections
into microcentrifuge tubes.
3. Deparaffinize sections by adding 1 mL of xylene. Vortex, then
incubate at room temperature for 10 minutes.
4. Centrifuge at 14,000 rpm for 2 minutes. Discard xylene.
5. Wash the tissue pellet with 1 mL of 100% ethanol, vortex and
centrifuge. Repeat the wash with 80% and 70% ethanol.
6. Air dry the tissue pellet for 10 minutes under a clean bench.
6.2. DNA Extraction
1. Use the Qiagen FFPE DNA extraction kit following the
manufacturer's instructions.
2. Quantitate DNA concentration using a Nanodrop
spectrophotometer.
3. Verify the DNA quality with a Qubit fluorometer.
6.3. DNA Labeling and Hybridization
1. Follow the manufacturer's protocol for the chromosomal
microarray platform:
◦ Prepare the DNA for hybridization using the provided DNA
labeling reagents.
◦ Fragment and label the DNA as specified in the kit.
◦ Set up hybridization reactions in accordance with the
manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Hybridize samples in the hybridization oven for the
recommended duration and temperature.
6.4. Washing and Scanning
1. Post-hybridization, wash the microarray slides using the
specific wash buffers provided by the manufacturer.
2. Scan the microarray slides using a compatible microarray
scanner.
3. Check that the scanner settings are optimized to generate high-
quality images.
6.5. Data Analysis
1. Upload the microarray data into the analysis software provided
by the manufacturer.
2. Perform quality control checks on raw data.
3. Analyze the data to identify chromosomal gains, losses, and
regions of homozygosity.
7. QA/QC PROCEDURES
1. All reagents must be within their expiry dates and stored as per
the manufacturers' instructions.
2. All equipment must be calibrated and maintained as per the
laboratory's SOP.
3. A minimum DNA concentration and quality are required before
proceeding to ensure reliable results.
4. Include positive and negative controls in each batch of CMA to
validate test runs.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Review and interpret the data to generate a report.
2. Validate and verify the data with a secondary analyst.
3. Report the findings to the ordering physician via the laboratory
information management system (LIMS).
9. DOCUMENTATION
1. Record all procedural steps, observations, and deviations in the
laboratory notebook or electronic record.
2. Retain data files, analysis logs, and any other relevant
documentation according to laboratory policies and regulatory
requirements.
