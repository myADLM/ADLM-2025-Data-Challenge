Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Chromosomal Microarray Analysis (CMA) for Tumor Samples - Fresh
or Frozen
1. PURPOSE
This SOP describes the analytical procedures for performing
chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) on fresh or frozen tumor
tissues. CMA is used to detect copy number variations (CNVs) and
loss of heterozygosity (LOH) which may be present in tumor
samples.
2. SCOPE
This protocol applies to all laboratory personnel involved in the
analytical phase of CMA for tumor samples. It outlines the
procedures from receipt of the sample to data generation.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
All laboratory personnel are responsible for following this SOP. The
technologist performing the test must ensure that all relevant quality
control measures are strictly adhered to. The supervisor must verify
that personnel have followed the protocol accurately.
4. DEFINITIONS
• Chromosomal Microarray Analysis (CMA): A technology used
to detect chromosomal imbalances, such as gains or losses of
chromosomal regions.
• Sample: Fresh or frozen tumor tissue.
5. PROCEDURE
5.1. Sample Preparation
a. Verify that the sample meets acceptance criteria: fresh or frozen
tumor tissue without signs of contamination or degradation.
b. Handle all samples using aseptic techniques and ensure
appropriate labelling.
c. If using frozen samples, allow the sample to thaw on ice till just
thawed.
5.2. DNA Extraction
a. Extract genomic DNA from the tumor tissue using a validated DNA
extraction kit.
b. Quantify and assess the quality of the DNA using
spectrophotometry (e.g., NanoDrop) and fluorometry (e.g., Qubit).
c. Assess DNA integrity using gel electrophoresis or a Fragment
Analyzer to ensure high molecular weight DNA.
5.3. DNA Digestion and Fragmentation
a. Digest the DNA using appropriate restriction enzymes following the
manufacturer's recommendations.
b. Verify digestion efficiency using gel electrophoresis.
5.4. Labeling and Hybridization
a. Label the DNA samples with fluorescent dyes (e.g., Cy3 and Cy5)
following the labeling kit protocol.
b. Purify the labeled samples to remove unincorporated dyes.
c. Quantitate labeling efficiency using a spectrophotometer.
d. Denature and hybridize the labeled DNA to the microarray slide
following the manufacturer's instructions.
5.5. Washing
a. Perform washing procedures to remove nonspecifically bound
DNA as per the array manufacturer’s protocol.
5.6. Scanning and Data Collection
a. Scan the microarray slides using the appropriate microarray
scanner.
b. Collect the fluorescence intensities using the manufacturer's
software.
5.7. Data Analysis
a. Import the raw data into the appropriate microarray analysis
software.
b. Perform normalization and analysis to identify CNVs and LOH
regions.
c. Use appropriate algorithms and reference genome data settings.
5.8. Interpretation and Reporting
a. Review the results, looking for significant regions of CNV and
LOH.
b. Document findings in the laboratory information system (LIS),
following interpretation guidelines.
c. Generate a report summarizing the findings, including clinical
significance, if applicable.
6. QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE
• Run controls with each batch to ensure the accuracy and
precision of the CMA results.
• Include positive controls (DNA with known CNVs) and negative
controls with each run.
• Ensure that DNA extraction, labeling, and hybridization
efficiencies meet predefined criteria.
• Document all QC samples on the appropriate log sheets.
• Any deviations from this SOP must be documented and reviewed
by the laboratory supervisor.
• Regular proficiency testing and inter-laboratory comparisons
should be conducted to ensure ongoing competency.
7. SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS
• Handle all biological samples using appropriate personal
protective equipment (PPE) and biosafety measures.
• Dispose of all waste, including sharps, according to the
laboratory’s waste disposal guidelines.
