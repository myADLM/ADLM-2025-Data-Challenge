STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP) FOR ANALYTICAL
PHASE OF CHROMOSOME ANALYSIS (AMNIOTIC FLUID)
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedures for performing chromosome analysis on
amniotic fluid samples to ensure accurate and reliable results are
generated.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
The following personnel are responsible for the tasks outlined in this
SOP:
• Laboratory Technologists: Responsible for performing and
documenting all steps in the process.
• Supervisors: Responsible for overseeing the procedure, handling
any deviations or issues, ensuring quality control, and validating
results.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Microscope with imaging capabilities
• CO2 incubator
• Centrifuge
• Water bath
• Sterile pipettes and pipette tips
• Sterile culture flasks and dishes
• Tissue culture media (Chang Medium/D-MEM/F-12 supplemented
with fetal bovine serum)
• Colcemid
• Hypotonic KCl solution (0.075M)
• Fixative solution (Methanol:Acetic Acid, 3:1)
• Giemsa stain
• Slide racks and microscope slides
• Flammable waste container (for fixative disposal)
• Amniotic fluid sample (10-20mL recommended)
1. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation and Culture
1. Verify the patient and sample identification with accompanying
requisition.
2. Centrifuge the amniotic fluid at 1000 rpm for 10 minutes at
room temperature.
3. Discard the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in 10mL
of pre-warmed sterile culture medium.
4. Transfer the resuspended cells into sterile culture flasks or
dishes and place in the CO2 incubator at 37°C.
5. Monitor cell growth daily. Replace the culture medium every 2-3
days until a confluent monolayer is achieved (usually 7-10
days).
B. Harvesting Cells
1. Add Colcemid to the culture medium at a final concentration of
0.05 µg/mL. Incubate for 1 hour to arrest cells in metaphase.
2. Trypsinize the cells by adding 2-3 mL of trypsin-EDTA solution
to detach cells from the flask/dish.
3. Transfer cells to a centrifuge tube and centrifuge at 1000 rpm
for 10 minutes.
4. Aspirate the supernatant, resuspend the cell pellet in 10mL of
pre-warmed hypotonic KCl solution, and incubate at 37°C for
15-20 minutes.
5. Fix cells by adding drop-wise, while gently mixing, 10 mL of
cold fixative solution. Centrifuge at 1000 rpm for 10 minutes
and wash with fixative 2-3 times.
C. Slide Preparation and Staining
1. Drop the fixed cell suspension onto clean slides to prepare
metaphase spreads.
2. Air dry the slides and check microscopically for cell density and
metaphase spread quality.
3. Stain the slides in Giemsa solution (1:20 dilution) for 5-7
minutes.
4. Rinse the slides briefly in distilled water and air dry.
D. Microscopy and Analysis
1. Analyze the slides under the microscope at 400x magnification
to locate metaphase spreads.
2. Capture high-quality images of at least 20 metaphase spreads.
3. Karyotype the chromosomes using microscopy imaging
software, identifying and documenting any chromosomal
abnormalities.
4. Perform a secondary review by a certified cytogeneticist.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include a known normal control and an abnormal control with
every batch of amniotic fluid samples processed.
• Perform proficiency testing regularly to ensure accuracy and
consistency.
• Document deviations, repeating any procedures if quality control
fails.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Review and validate karyotype findings.
• Document results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Notify the referring physician of abnormal results following
laboratory protocol.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Refer to standard human karyotype references for normal findings.
Any deviations from the normal 46,XX or 46,XY karyotype must be
reported and properly annotated.

• ISCN (International System for Human Cytogenomic
Nomenclature)

NOTE: Ensure that the laboratory safety protocols are followed,
especially when handling hazardous chemicals like fixative solutions.
Proper disposal of waste complying with safety and environmental
regulations is mandatory.
