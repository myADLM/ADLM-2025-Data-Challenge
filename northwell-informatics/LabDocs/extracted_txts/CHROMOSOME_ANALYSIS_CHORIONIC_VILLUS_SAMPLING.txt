Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Chromosome Analysis
from Chorionic Villus Sampling (CVS)
1. PURPOSE:
To outline the procedures for processing and analyzing Chorionic
Villus Sampling (CVS) specimens to generate chromosome analysis
results.
1. SCOPE:
This procedure applies to the handling and analysis of CVS
specimens from the point of receipt in the laboratory to the
generation of results.
1. RESPONSIBILITY:
• Laboratory Technologists: Responsible for specimen processing,
cell culture, harvesting, staining, microscopy, and analysis of
chromosome preparations.
• Laboratory Supervisors: Responsible for overseeing the process,
ensuring quality control, and validating results.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS:
Acceptable Specimen:
◦ Chorionic villus tissue collected via transcervical or
transabdominal CVS procedure.
◦ Tissue should be transported in sterile culture medium or
saline solution.
◦ Specimen must arrive in the laboratory within 24 hours of
collection and kept at an appropriate temperature (2-8°C)
during transport.
Unacceptable Specimens:
◦ Specimen that arrives dry, without culture medium or saline.
◦ Specimen that has been contaminated or has visibly
degraded.
2. EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS:
◦ Sterile culture media.
◦ Centrifuge and accessories.
◦ Incubator set at 37°C with 5% CO2.
◦ Dissecting microscope.
◦ Sterile Petri dishes.
◦ Trypsin-EDTA solution.
◦ Hypotonic solution (0.075 M KCl).
◦ Fixative solution (3:1 Methanol:Glacial Acetic Acid).
◦ Chromosome staining reagents (Giemsa stain).
◦ Microscope slides.
◦ Coverslips.
◦ Light microscope with appropriate magnification for
cytogenetic analysis.
3. PROCEDURE:
A) Specimen Receipt and Initial Processing:
1. Record the receipt of the CVS specimen in the laboratory
information system (LIS).
2. Inspect the specimen for adequacy and condition.
3. Transfer the chorionic villus tissue to a sterile Petri dish
containing sterile culture medium.
B) Dissection and Culture Setup:
1. Under a dissecting microscope, identify and isolate chorionic
villi from any maternal tissue contamination.
2. Mince the chorionic villus tissue into small pieces using sterile
forceps and scissors.
3. Transfer the minced tissue into a culture flask with pre-warmed
sterile culture medium.
4. Incubate the culture flask at 37°C with 5% CO2.
C) Cell Harvesting:
1. Monitor cultures daily for growth (typically 5-7 days).
2. When adequate growth is observed, treat the culture with
trypsin-EDTA to disperse the cells.
3. Centrifuge cells and resuspend in hypotonic solution (0.075 M
KCl) for 15-20 minutes at 37°C to swell the cells.
4. Fix cells by adding fixative solution dropwise to the cell
suspension while vortexing gently.
5. Repeat fixation and washing steps as necessary.
D) Slide Preparation and Staining:
1. Drop cell suspension onto clean microscope slides and allow to
air-dry.
2. Stain the slides using Giemsa stain for chromosome
visualization.
3. Rinse slides, air dry, and cover with coverslips.
E) Microscopic Examination and Analysis:
1. Examine the stained slides under a light microscope.
2. Analyze a minimum of 20 metaphase spreads for chromosome
count and structure.
3. Perform karyotyping and document the findings.
4. QUALITY CONTROL:
◦ Include positive and negative controls with each batch of
culture and analysis.
◦ Ensure appropriate calibration and maintenance of all
equipment.
◦ Perform regular proficiency testing and maintain
competency records of personnel.
5. REPORTING RESULTS:
◦ Enter preliminary and final results into the LIS.
◦ Review and validate the karyotyping results by a qualified
supervisor or senior technologist.
◦ Generate a formal report, including findings and clinical
interpretation.
◦ Ensure accurate and timely communication of results to the
referring physician or genetic counselor.
6. DOCUMENTATION:
◦ Maintain comprehensive documentation of each case, from
specimen receipt to final reporting.
◦ Ensure all records are stored confidentially and are
accessible for quality assurance and auditing purposes.

cytogenetics and genetic diagnostic bodies.
• Standard texts and manuals on cytogenetic techniques.
This SOP shall be reviewed and updated annually or as necessary to
reflect changes in protocols and technological advancements.
