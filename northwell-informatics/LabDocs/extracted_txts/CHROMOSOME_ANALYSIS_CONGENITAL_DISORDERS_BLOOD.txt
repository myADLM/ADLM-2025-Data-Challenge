Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Chromosome Analysis:
Congenital Disorders (Blood)
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for chromosome analysis on blood samples
for detecting congenital disorders. This protocol ensures the accurate
identification and reporting of chromosomal abnormalities, applying
standard techniques in cytogenetics.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory technologists are responsible for
performing and documenting all steps in the chromosome
analysis procedure.
• Supervisors are responsible for overseeing the process, ensuring
compliance with the SOP, and validating results.
2. DEFINITIONS
Chromosome Analysis: A laboratory technique that examines the
number and structure of chromosomes in cells to identify genetic
abnormalities.
Congenital Disorders: Medical conditions that are present from
birth, which may result from chromosomal abnormalities.
3. PROCEDURE
3.1 Specimen Requirements
• Preferred Specimen: Peripheral blood collected in a sterile,
heparinized blood collection tube (dark green top) to avoid
clotting. The specimen should be collected aseptically.
• Volume: A minimum of 5 mL of blood is optimal.
• Transportation: Specimens should be transported to the
laboratory at room temperature as soon as possible, ideally within
24 hours of collection.
3.2 Equipment and Reagents
• Centrifuge
• Culture media for lymphocyte stimulation (e.g., RPMI 1640,
supplemented with fetal bovine serum and phytohemagglutinin)
• CO2 incubator
• Hypotonic solution (e.g., 0.075 M KCl)
• Fixative solution (3:1 methanol:acetic acid)
• Microscope with high-resolution imaging capabilities
• Chromosome staining kits (e.g., Giemsa, Trypsin-Giemsa for G-
banding)
• Reagent-grade water
• Sterile culture flasks
• Antibacterial and antifungal agents (e.g., penicillin-streptomycin)
3.3 Procedure for Chromosome Analysis
1. Setup Culture:
◦ Add 0.5 mL of heparinized blood to 4.5 mL of pre-warmed
culture media in a sterile culture flask.
◦ Add appropriate amounts of mitogen (phytohemagglutinin)
to stimulate lymphocyte division.
◦ Incubate the cultures at 37°C in a CO2 incubator (5% CO2)
for 72 hours.
2. Harvesting Cells:
◦ Add colcemid to the cultures 1-2 hours before harvest to
arrest cells in metaphase.
◦ Transfer the cultures to sterile centrifuge tubes and
centrifuge at 1000 rpm for 10 minutes.
◦ Carefully remove the supernatant and resuspend the cell
pellet in prewarmed hypotonic solution (0.075 M KCl).
Incubate at 37°C for 20 minutes to swell the cells.
◦ Centrifuge again and remove most of the supernatant,
leaving about 0.5 mL. Gradually add the fixative solution
while gently mixing, and let the solution sit for 10 minutes.
◦ Centrifuge and repeat the fixation step twice more for
thorough cell preservation.
3. Slide Preparation:
◦ Drop the fixed cell suspension onto clean, dry microscope
slides from a height of approximately 20–30 cm.
◦ Allow the slides to air-dry at room temperature or in a
controlled humidity environment.
4. Staining:
◦ Age the slides overnight at room temperature.
◦ Stain the slides using the G-banding technique (Trypsin-
Giemsa staining). Dip the slides in trypsin solution, rinse
with water, and then stain with Giemsa stain.
5. Microscopy Analysis:
◦ Examine the stained slides under a microscope at 1000x
magnification.
◦ Capture high-resolution images of metaphase spreads for
chromosome analysis.
3.4 Chromosome Analysis and Reporting
• Analyze a minimum of 20 metaphase spreads per case for
numerical and structural abnormalities.
• Confirm abnormal results with a second technologist or
supervisor.
• Use standardized nomenclature for recording chromosome
findings (e.g., ISCN guidelines).
• Document and report findings in the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
3.5 Quality Control
• Include a known control sample with every batch of patient
samples to validate the effectiveness of the culture, harvesting,
and staining procedures.
• Participate in external quality assurance programs and inter-
laboratory comparisons.
• Record all quality control measures and corrective actions when
quality standards are not met.
3.6 Reference Intervals
• Normal karyotype: 46,XX or 46,XY
• Any deviations from the normal karyotype should be documented
and interpreted according to the clinical significance.
3.7 Reporting Results
• Results must be verified by a qualified technologist and reviewed
by a cytogenetics supervisor or a geneticist.
• Provide results in a standardized report format with interpretations
included.
4. SAFETY PRECAUTIONS
• Follow biosafety guidelines for handling human blood specimens.
• Use PPE (personal protective equipment) such as gloves, lab
coats, and safety glasses.
• Dispose of all biological waste in accordance with local
regulations and laboratory protocols.

Nomenclature) guidelines for karyotyping.
