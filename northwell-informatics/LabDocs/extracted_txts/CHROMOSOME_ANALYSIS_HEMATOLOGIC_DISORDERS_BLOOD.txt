Standard Operating Procedure for Chromosome Analysis in
Hematologic Disorders, Blood
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for chromosome analysis on
blood samples from patients with hematologic disorders. This
procedure ensures consistency, accuracy, and reliability in the results
generated and reported.
Responsibility:
• Laboratory Technologist: Responsible for performing
chromosome analysis according to this protocol and documenting
all findings.
• Supervisor: Ensures adherence to protocols, oversees quality
control, addresses discrepancies, and validates final results.
1. DEFINITIONS
Chromosome analysis (karyotyping): A laboratory procedure to
evaluate the number and structure of chromosomes in cells to detect
genetic abnormalities associated with hematologic disorders.
Hematologic disorders: Blood-related diseases that can affect the
bone marrow, blood cells, lymph nodes, spleen, and other organs.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen Type:
• Freshly collected peripheral blood (3-5 mL) in a sterile
heparinized (sodium or lithium heparin) container.
Specimen Stability:
• Transport to the laboratory within 24 hours of collection at room
temperature.
• Specimens stored beyond 24 hours or subjected to extreme
temperatures are unacceptable.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Sterile blood collection tubes (sodium or lithium heparin)
• Tissue culture media
• Colcemid (to arrest mitosis)
• Hypotonic solution (e.g., 0.075 M KCl)
• Fixative (Carnoy's solution: methanol:glacial acetic acid 3:1)
• Staining solutions (trypsin-giemsa for G-banding)
• Microscope with appropriate magnification and imaging
capabilities
• Thermostatic water bath or incubator set to 37°C
• Centrifuge
• Sterile pipettes and tips
• Glass slides and coverslips
• Quality control samples (known normal and abnormal karyotypes)
1. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Setup:
1. Culture Setup:
◦ Label all culture tubes with patient information and date of
setup.
◦ In a sterile hood, add 5 mL of tissue culture media to each of
the labeled culture tubes.
◦ Add 0.5 mL of heparinized blood to each tube.
◦ Incubate at 37°C for 72 hours.
2. Harvesting Cells:
◦ Add Colcemid to cultures 1-2 hours before harvest to arrest
cells in metaphase.
◦ Centrifuge cultures at 500 g for 10 minutes. Carefully
remove the supernatant.
◦ Gently resuspend the cell pellet in pre-warmed hypotonic
solution and incubate at 37°C for 20 minutes.
◦ Centrifuge at 500 g for 10 minutes and remove the
supernatant.
◦ Fix cells by adding cold fixative slowly while vortexing.
Centrifuge and repeat fixative addition 2-3 times until the
cell pellet is clean.
3. Slide Preparation:
◦ Drop cell suspension onto clean glass slides from a height
to spread chromosomes.
◦ Let slides air dry.
4. Staining:
◦ Immerse slides in trypsin solution for 20-25 seconds.
◦ Rinse briefly in distilled water.
◦ Stain with Giemsa solution diluted 1:20 in Giemsa buffer.
◦ Rinse thoroughly with water and dry.
B. Analysis:
1. Microscopy:
◦ Examine slides under a microscope to identify well-spread
metaphase cells.
◦ Capture images of at least 20 metaphases for detailed
analysis.
2. Karyotyping:
◦ Analyze chromosomes for number and structural integrity.
◦ Classify any observed abnormalities according to the
International System for Human Cytogenetic Nomenclature
(ISCN).
3. QUALITY CONTROL
Internal Quality Control:
• Use normal control specimen slides with each batch of patient
samples.
• Document results of quality control specimens.
• Analyze known abnormal control slides regularly to ensure
procedural accuracy.
• If control results are aberrant, repeat entire process ensuring no
procedural error.
External Quality Control:
• Participate in proficiency testing programs or inter-laboratory
comparison programs.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Document findings in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Include comprehensive details of karyotype (e.g., 46, XX, t(9;22)
(q34;q11)).
• For abnormal results, provide interpretation relevant to
hematologic disorder.
• Supervisor to validate all final results prior to release.
