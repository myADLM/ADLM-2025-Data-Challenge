Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Chromosome Analysis
in Hematologic Disorders Using Bone Marrow Samples
1. PURPOSE
This SOP document delineates the protocol for performing
chromosome analysis on bone marrow samples for patients with
hematologic disorders. The procedure involves harvesting, culturing,
harvesting and preparing bone marrow cells for karyotyping and
identifying chromosomal abnormalities.
Responsibility:
All designated lab personnel are responsible for performing the
chromosome analysis accurately and efficiently according to this
SOP. It is the responsibility of supervisors to ensure compliance and
provide necessary training and resources.
2. DEFINITION
Chromosome analysis: Examination of chromosomal abnormalities in
bone marrow samples collected from patients with hematologic
disorders.
3. PROCEDURE
A) SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND HANDLING
Acceptable Specimens:
• Fresh bone marrow aspirate (2-5 mL) collected in sterile
heparinized tubes (sodium heparin or lithium heparin).
• Specimen should be transported to the laboratory at room
temperature within 24 hours of collection.
• Specimen labeling must include patient information, collection
date and time, and the ordering physician’s information.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens that have clotted.
• Specimens that are frozen or have been in transit for more than
24 hours.
• Specimens with inadequate labeling.
B) EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Centrifuge
• CO2 incubator
• Microscope
• Water bath
• Sterile laminar flow hood
• Hypotonic solution (0.075M KCl)
• Fixative (3:1 methanol to acetic acid)
Reagents:
• Colcemid
• RPMI 1640 medium
• Fetal bovine serum
• Phytohemagglutinin (PHA)
• Trypsin
• Giemsa stain
Supplies:
• Sterile culture flasks
• Sterile pipettes
• Glass slides
• Coverslips
• Band-Aids and alcohol pads (for bone marrow collection)
C) CULTURING CELLS
1. Sample Preparation:
◦ Transport bone marrow sample to the lab immediately.
◦ Under a sterile hood, mix the bone marrow sample gently to
avoid clotting.
◦ Dispense 1-2 mL of bone marrow into a sterile culture flask
containing 10 mL of RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum and 1% antibiotic-antimycotic
solution.
2. Setting Up Cultures:
◦ Incubate culture flasks at 37°C in a CO2 incubator for 24-48
hours.
◦ Add 0.1 μg/mL Colcemid to the cultures 1-2 hours before
harvesting to arrest cells in metaphase.
D) HARVESTING CELLS
1. Hypotonic Treatment:
◦ Centrifuge culture flasks at 500g for 10 minutes.
◦ Carefully aspirate and discard the supernatant.
◦ Resuspend the cell pellet in pre-warmed hypotonic KCl
solution (0.075M).
◦ Incubate at 37°C for 20-30 minutes.
2. Fixation:
◦ Centrifuge at 500g for 10 minutes and discard the
supernatant.
◦ Add cold fixative (3:1 methanol:acetic acid), mix gently, and
wait for 10 minutes at room temperature.
◦ Repeat fixation 2-3 more times until the cell pellet is clean.
E) SLIDE PREPARATION AND STAINING
1. Slide Preparation:
◦ Drop fixed cell suspension onto clean glass slides, ensuring
cells are evenly spread.
◦ Air dry the slides thoroughly.
2. G-Banding and Staining:
◦ Use trypsin solution to treat the slides, followed by rinsing
with distilled water.
◦ Stain with Giemsa stain for approximately 5-10 minutes.
◦ Rinse excess stain with water and air dry the slides.
F) ANALYSIS AND REPORTING
1. Microscopic Examination:
◦ Examine the stained slides under a microscope to identify
well-spread metaphase cells.
◦ Capture images of metaphase cells for karyotyping.
◦ Analyze the karyotypes to detect any chromosomal
abnormalities.
2. Documentation and Reporting:
◦ Document the findings in the laboratory information system
(LIS).
◦ Include detailed descriptions of any abnormalities observed
(e.g., translocations, deletions, duplications).
◦ Generate a comprehensive report and forward it to the
ordering physician for clinical correlation.
G) QUALITY CONTROL
1. Controls:
◦ Include internal and external control slides with each batch
of samples.
◦ Regularly calibrate and maintain all equipment according to
manufacturer guidelines.
2. Proficiency Testing:
◦ Participate in external proficiency testing programs to
ensure accuracy and reliability of results.

Refer to the latest editions of relevant scientific publications and
manufacturer instructions for detailed methodologies and
troubleshooting.
Ensuring rigorous adherence to these procedures will maintain high
standards of accuracy and reliability in chromosome analysis for
hematologic disorders, ultimately contributing to improved patient
care and outcomes.
