Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Chromosome Analysis in
Hematologic Disorders, Children's Oncology Group Enrollment
Testing
1. PURPOSE
To outline the steps and procedures required for performing
chromosome analysis in hematologic disorders and Children's
Oncology Group (COG) enrollment testing for blood samples. This
SOP ensures precise and accurate chromosome analysis which is
crucial for patient diagnosis, prognosis, and effective treatment
strategies.
Responsibility: Highly trained and designated laboratory personnel
are responsible for performing chromosome analysis and COG
enrollment testing according to this procedure. All lab staff must
adhere to the guidelines to ensure quality results.
1. DEFINITION
Chromosome analysis involves karyotyping and cytogenetic testing
to detect numerical and structural chromosome abnormalities in
hematologic disorders. Children's Oncology Group enrollment testing
encompasses specific genetic and cytogenetic tests required for
enrolling children in cancer research and clinical trials.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Acceptable Specimens:
• Bone marrow aspirate collected in a heparinized syringe.
• Peripheral blood collected in a heparinized vacutainer (green top
tube).
• The preferred volume is 2-5 mL of bone marrow or 5-10 mL of
peripheral blood.
• Specimens must be transported to the laboratory immediately
after collection and should be processed within 24 hours to
ensure optimal cell viability.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens received in evacuated tubes such as EDTA, sodium
citrate, or sodium fluoride/oxalate tubes.
• Specimens that are clotted or hemolyzed.
• Specimens with significant air bubbles or contamination.
• Specimens not containing sufficient volume for testing.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation:
1. Record specimen details including patient information,
collection date, and time.
2. Label and prepare slides using the correct specimen identifier.
3. Centrifuge blood specimens at 1000 rpm for 10 minutes to
separate plasma and buffy coat.
4. Isolate the buffy coat and proceed with culture setup.
B. Culture Setup and Growth:
1. Set up short-term and long-term cultures using RPMI 1640
medium supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum and
antibiotics.
2. Incubate cultures at 37°C with 5% CO2 for 24-72 hours.
3. Check cultures daily for cell growth and contamination.
C. Harvesting Cells:
1. Add colcemid to cultures 2-3 hours before harvesting to arrest
cells in metaphase.
2. Harvest cells by centrifugation, then treat with hypotonic
solution for 15-20 minutes.
3. Fix cells using a methanol/acetic acid solution (3:1 ratio).
D. Slide Preparation and Banding:
1. Drop fixed cells onto pre-cleaned slides and air dry.
2. Perform G-banding using trypsin and Giemsa stain.
3. Check slides under the microscope to ensure proper banding
and chromosomal spread.
E. Analysis and Reporting:
1. Analyze metaphase spreads using a microscope and
chromosome analysis software.
2. Interpret results and document chromosome abnormalities.
3. Generate a detailed report including karyotyping results,
interpretations, and clinical recommendations.
4. Ensure results are reviewed and verified by a qualified
geneticist or cytogenetic technologist.
5. Report findings following site-specific guidelines and
communicate critical results promptly to the referring physician.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
1. External and internal quality controls must be done to
verify the accuracy and reliability of tests.
2. Participate in proficiency testing programs and cross-
check results with standardized controls.
3. Perform routine maintenance and calibration of lab
equipment essential for chromosome analysis.
7. METHOD LIMITATIONS
◦ Culture failures due to poor specimen quality or
contamination.
◦ Incomplete metaphase cells resulting in inaccurate
analyses.
◦ Intrinsic patient-related factors affecting chromosome
stability and growth.

and analysis software.
1. SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENT
◦ Follow universal precautions for handling blood specimens.
◦ Ensure proper disposal of biohazard materials.
◦ Maintain a sterile environment to prevent culture
contamination.
By following this protocol, laboratory personnel will achieve
consistent and accurate results crucial for diagnosing and treating
hematologic disorders and optimizing enrollment in Children's
Oncology Group studies.
