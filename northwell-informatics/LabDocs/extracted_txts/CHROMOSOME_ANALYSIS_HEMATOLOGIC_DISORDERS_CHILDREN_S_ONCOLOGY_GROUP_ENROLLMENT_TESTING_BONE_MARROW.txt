STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE Chromosome Analysis,
Hematologic Disorders, Children's Oncology Group Enrollment
Testing, Bone Marrow
1. PURPOSE
This SOP describes the process of generating accurate and reliable
results for chromosome analysis in hematologic disorders for
Children’s Oncology Group enrollment using bone marrow
specimens. The protocol ensures that all procedures are consistent,
well-documented, and meet CLIA standards.
Responsibility: Designated staff are responsible for following this
SOP, performing analyses, documenting results, and taking
appropriate corrective actions when necessary.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
Specimen:
• Acceptable: Fresh bone marrow aspirates collected in sterile
containers with anticoagulant (e.g., sodium heparin or EDTA).
Specimens should be sent to the laboratory within 24 hours post-
collection.
• Unacceptable: Specimens that are clotted, collected in non-sterile
containers, or exceed 24 hours post-collection without proper
refrigeration (maintained at 2-8°C).
Specimen Handling:
• Transport specimens immediately to the cytogenetics laboratory.
• Maintain bone marrow specimens at room temperature until
processing begins.
1. PROCEDURE
A) Direct Harvest:
1. Upon specimen arrival, verify patient information and collection
details.
2. Observe the specimen for adequacy (should contain visible
bone marrow fragments).
3. Aspirate bone marrow cells using a sterile pipette and transfer
to a sterile centrifuge tube containing complete chromosome
medium.
4. Incubate the tube in a 37°C incubator for 2-4 hours.
B) Culture Set-Up:
1. Add the aspirated bone marrow sample to culture media
bottles. Mix thoroughly.
2. Incubate cultures at 37°C with 5% CO₂ in a humidified
atmosphere for 24-48 hours.
3. Perform daily microscopic examinations to monitor cell growth
and morphology.
C) Harvesting and Slide Preparation:
1. Add colcemid to arrest cells in metaphase, incubate for 30
minutes at 37°C.
2. Centrifuge cultures at 1000 RPM for 5 minutes, carefully
aspirate supernatant.
3. Hypotonic treatment with 0.075 M KCl, incubate for 20 minutes
at 37°C, followed by fixation in methanol/acetic acid.
4. Repeat fixation 3 times ensuring cells settle.
5. Drop the fixed suspension onto clean, dry slides from a height
to ensure even spreading.
6. Air-dry slides for 24 hours or use a slide warmer at 56°C for
rapid drying.
D) Banding and Staining:
1. Age the slides in an aging chamber at 45°C for 24 hours.
2. G-banding: Treat slides with trypsin for 30 seconds.
3. Stain slides using Giemsa staining solution for 5 minutes.
4. Rinse slides in distilled water and air-dry before analysis.
E) Microscopic Analysis:
1. Examine stained slides under a microscope with oil immersion.
2. Locate and count adequate metaphases (minimum of 20 cells
for standard analysis).
3. Capture high-quality metaphase images using imaging
software.
4. Analyze chromosome morphology focusing on break points,
structural abnormalities, and numerical changes.
5. Interpret findings and correlate with clinical diagnosis.
6. QUALITY CONTROL:
7. Verify the functionality and calibration of microscopes and
imaging systems daily.
8. Include positive and negative control slides with each batch to
validate staining procedures.
9. Document all analyses, discrepancies, and corrective actions in
the laboratory information system (LIS).
10. Perform peer review of unclear or complex cases with a senior
cytogeneticist.
11. REPORTING RESULTS:
12. Generate a detailed report including chromosomal counts,
significant findings, and clinical correlations.
13. Ensure all results are reviewed, confirmed, and signed by a
qualified cytogeneticist.
14. Transmit the final report to the physician electronically and
ensure records are retained in LIS adhering to regulatory
compliance.
15. REFERENCE INTERVALS:
• Normal Karyotype: 46,XX or 46,XY.
• Structural abnormalities and specific numeric changes will be
reported if relevant to the clinical indications and disorders under
study.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
• Contaminations, inadequate specimen volume, or poor cell
viability may impact analysis results.
• Errors in banding and staining techniques affect chromosome
visualization.

• Manufacturer guidelines for cytogenetic media, colcemid, and
staining solutions.
• Standard cytogenetics laboratory reference texts and peer-
reviewed articles on hematologic disorders and oncology.
