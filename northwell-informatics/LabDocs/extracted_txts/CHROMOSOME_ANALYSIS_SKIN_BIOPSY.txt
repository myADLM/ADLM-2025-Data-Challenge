Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Chromosome Analysis
of Skin Biopsy Specimens
1. PURPOSE To provide a detailed procedure for the chromosome
analysis of skin biopsy specimens for identifying chromosomal
abnormalities.
2. SCOPE This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel involved
in the processing and analysis of skin biopsy specimens for
chromosomal studies.
3. RESPONSIBILITY It is the responsibility of trained laboratory
personnel to ensure that this procedure is followed accurately and
efficiently. Supervisors are responsible for overseeing the process
and providing guidance as needed.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Skin biopsy, preferably collected from the inner
forearm or behind the ear.
• Volume: Approximately 2-5 mm in diameter.
• Collection: Collected aseptically and stored in sterile transport
medium.
• Transport Conditions: Maintain at 4°C and transport to the
laboratory within 24 hours.
5. MATERIALS AND REAGENTS
• Sterile Petri dishes or culture flasks
• Sterile scalpels and forceps
• Collagenase II or Dispase
• Culture media: RPMI-1640 supplemented with fetal bovine serum,
antibiotics, and L-glutamine
• Colchicine/Colcemid
• Hypotonic solution (0.075 M KCl)
• Fixative (3:1 methanol-acetic acid)
• Microscope slides
• Trypsin solution for chromosome banding
• Giemsa stain
6. EQUIPMENT
• Biological safety cabinet
• CO2 incubator
• Water bath
• Centrifuge
• Microscope
7. PROCEDURE
7.1 Preparation for Skin Biopsy for Chromosomal Analysis
• Handle the biopsy sample in a sterile environment.
• Mince the biopsy tissues into small fragments (1-2 mm) using
sterile scalpels.
• Place the tissue fragments in a sterilized Petri dish with
RPMI-1640 culture medium.
• Add collagenase II or dispase to digest the connective tissue and
incubate at 37°C for 30-60 minutes with frequent agitation.
7.2 Establishing Primary Culture
• Centrifuge the digested tissue fragments at 1200 rpm for 10
minutes.
• Discard the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in fresh
culture medium.
• Transfer the cell suspension to culture flasks and incubate at
37°C with 5% CO2.
• Change the medium every 2-3 days until fibroblasts reach
80-90% confluence.
7.3 Harvesting Cells for Chromosomal Analysis
• Upon reaching the desired confluence, add colchicine/Colcemid
to the cultures to arrest cells in metaphase.
• Incubate for the recommended time (typically 1-2 hours).
• Trypsinize the cells and transfer to a centrifuge tube.
• Centrifuge and discard the supernatant.
• Slowly add pre-warmed hypotonic solution while gently
resuspending the cell pellet. Incubate at 37°C for 15 minutes.
• Centrifuge and discard the hypotonic solution.
• Add fresh fixative (3:1 methanol-acetic acid) drop-by-drop while
gently resuspending the cell pellet. Fix cells for 20 minutes.
• Centrifuge and repeat the fixation step twice more.
7.4 Slide Preparation and Staining
• Drop the fixed cell suspension onto clean microscope slides from
a height of 15-20 cm to spread the cells and allow them to air dry.
• Perform banding using trypsin and Giemsa stain to obtain G-
banded chromosomes.
• Rinse slides with distilled water and allow them to air dry.
7.5 Microscopic Analysis
• Examine the metaphase spreads under a microscope.
• Capture images of well-spread metaphases for detailed analysis.
• Analyze at least 20 metaphases for mosaicism and 5 for non-
mosaicism per sample, unless otherwise justified.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include known normal and abnormal control samples with each
batch of analysis.
• Check for consistency in mitotic index, banding quality, and
chromosome number.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
• Chromosomal abnormalities are described according to the
International System for Human Cytogenomic Nomenclature
(ISCN).
• Document findings and ensure that the report is reviewed and
verified by a qualified cytogeneticist before being issued.
10. REFERENCES
• ISCN: An International System for Human Cytogenomic
Nomenclature
• Textbook references and relevant scientific literature.
11. RECORDS MANAGEMENT All records including culture logs,
quality control data, and reporting documents must be maintained
and archived according to the laboratory’s regulations for record
retention.
