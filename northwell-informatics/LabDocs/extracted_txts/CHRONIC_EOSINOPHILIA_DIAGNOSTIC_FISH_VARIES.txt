Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Chronic Eosinophilia, Diagnostic FISH,
Varies
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the protocol for the analytical phase of generating
results for chronic eosinophilia using diagnostic fluorescence in situ
hybridization (FISH) testing. It ensures that appropriate procedures
are followed to maintain accuracy, reliability, and reproducibility of
test results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the trained clinical laboratory scientists (CLS)
and technologists to perform the FISH assays and ensure that all
results are analyzed according to established guidelines. Supervisors
and laboratory managers are responsible for ensuring compliance
with this SOP and providing appropriate training to staff members.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Peripheral blood or bone marrow
• Collection: Collected in heparin (green top tube)
• Volume: Minimum 5-10 mL of peripheral blood or 1-3 mL of bone
marrow.
• Stability: Specimens must be kept at room temperature and
processed within 24-48 hours of collection.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Fluorescence microscope
• FISH probes specific to the target gene abnormalities associated
with chronic eosinophilia (e.g., PDGFRB, PDGFRA, FGFR1)
• Hybridization buffer and wash buffers
• 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) counterstain
• Humidified chamber for hybridization
• Cover slips and slide preparation materials
• Fluorescence imaging software
5. PROCEDURE
A. Slide Preparation and Sample Processing
1. Prepare slides with specimens according to standard laboratory
protocols.
2. Pre-treat slides to remove cytoplasmic and non-nuclear
material using pre-fixation buffers.
3. Use protease digestion to enhance probe penetration by
immersing the slides in a protease solution at room temperature
for the specified duration.
4. Dehydrate the slides through a graded series of ethanol (70%,
85%, and 100%) and air-dry completely.
B. Probe Hybridization
1. Apply the selected FISH probe mixture to the target area of
each slide (approximately 10 µL per slide).
2. Cover each sample with a cover slip and seal the edges with
rubber cement to prevent evaporation.
3. Denature the probe and target DNA by placing slides on a
preheated hot plate at 75°C for 3-5 minutes.
4. Transfer the slides to a humidified chamber and incubate
overnight (12-16 hours) at 37°C to allow hybridization.
C. Post-Hybridization Washes
1. Remove the rubber cement and cover slips carefully.
2. Wash slides in pre-warmed post-hybridization wash solution
(2X SSC/0.3% NP-40) for 2 minutes at 72°C.
3. Wash slides again in 2X SSC/0.1% NP-40 buffer at room
temperature for 1 minute.
D. Counterstaining
1. Apply DAPI counterstain to each slide to visualize the nuclei.
2. Cover each sample with a fresh cover slip and seal edges with
nail polish.
E. Imaging and Analysis
1. Visualize the slides using a fluorescence microscope equipped
with appropriate filters for the FISH probes and DAPI.
2. Capture images of multiple fields per slide to ensure
representativeness.
3. Analyze the captured images using fluorescence imaging
software.
4. Identify and record the presence or absence of gene
rearrangements or amplifications associated with chronic
eosinophilia.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include positive and negative control samples with each batch of
patient specimens to ensure assay validity.
• Record lot numbers of reagents and probes in use.
• Document any deviations from standard procedure and the
corrective actions taken.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results are reviewed and interpreted by a qualified pathologist or
laboratory director.
• Generate a final report for each patient sample, detailing the FISH
findings, and include relevant clinical interpretation.
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS) for
secure transmission to the requesting clinician.
8. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Results are qualitative, indicating either the presence or absence of
specific gene rearrangements or amplifications. Any positive findings
should be correlated with clinical history and additional diagnostic
data.
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to FISH probe manufacturer’s insert for specific limitations.
Interfering substances may affect the hybridization efficiency and
fluorescence signal strength.
