Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Chronic Eosinophilia (Specified FISH)
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized, accurate, and reliable procedure for
analyzing and generating results for Chronic Eosinophilia using
Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) techniques to identify
specific genetic abnormalities related to the condition.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for
performing the FISH analysis and generating results. All laboratory
staff must ensure adherence to this SOP to maintain consistent and
reproducible results.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred Specimen:
• Bone marrow aspirate or peripheral blood in a sodium heparin
(green top) tube. It must be submitted to the laboratory as soon
as possible, preferably within 24 hours of collection.
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Specimens that have been clotted, hemolyzed, or have significant
delay in transport exceeding 24 hours.
• Specimens with no collection date/time indicated on the sample
container or requisition.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Fluorescence Microscope equipped with appropriate filters
• Hybridization chamber
• Incubator, Water bath, Heating block
• Centrifuge
• FISH Probe set specific to eosinophilic genetic abnormalities
• Slide warmer
• Humidified chamber
• Immersion oil
• Microscope slides and cover slips
• Ethanol series (70%, 85%, 100%)
• Fixative Solutions (Methanol:Acetic Acid, 3:1)
• DAPI counterstain solution
1. PROCEDURE
Sample Preparation:
1. Centrifuge the bone marrow aspirate or peripheral blood at
500g for 10 minutes to obtain the cell pellet.
2. Resuspend the cell pellet in 0.075M KCl and incubate at 37°C
for 20 minutes.
3. Centrifuge again at 1000g for 10 minutes and discard the
supernatant.
4. Add fresh fixative (Methanol:Acetic Acid, 3:1), drop by drop
while vortexing, until the pellet is well suspended. Repeat
washing with fixative 2-3 times.
Slide Preparation:
1. Drop the fixed cell suspension onto clean microscope slides
and air dry.
2. Treat slides with a series of ethanol dehydration (70%, 85%,
100%) for 2 minutes each and air-dry.
FISH Hybridization:
1. Apply the FISH probe set specific to eosinophilic genetic
abnormalities onto the target area of the slide.
2. Place the slides in a hybridization chamber and denature at
75°C for 2 minutes followed by hybridization at 37°C overnight.
3. Post hybridization wash with 2X SSC/0.3% NP-40 at 73°C for 2
minutes and rinse in 2X SSC at room temperature.
4. Dehydrate the slides in ethanol series (70%, 85%, 100%) again
and air dry.
Detection and Imaging:
1. Counterstain the slides with DAPI for 10 minutes and mount
with a cover slip using anti-fade mounting medium.
2. View the slides under a fluorescence microscope.
3. Capture images of 10 representative fields or 200 interphase
nuclei for analysis.
Analysis and Interpretation:
1. Compare the signals observed with the control/reference
signals specific to FISH probes for eosinophilia.
2. Classify the genetic abnormalities based on the patterns of
hybridization signals.
3. Document the findings following guidelines for FISH signal
interpretation.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include a positive control with known genetic abnormality related
to eosinophilia and a negative control for each batch of tests.
• Perform verification of FISH probe specificity and hybridization
efficiency using control samples.
• Conduct internal review and inter-laboratory comparison to
maintain consistency in test results.
• Record all QC data and report any deviations to the supervisor.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Document and review results using the laboratory information
system (LIS).
• Use site-specific reporting templates for final results.
• Report findings to the requesting clinician and include a detailed
interpretation of the genetic abnormalities identified.
• Ensure critical values are communicated immediately to the
clinician.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS AND LIMITATIONS
• Reference intervals for normal and abnormal findings should be
clearly defined based on the established FISH analysis
guidelines.
• Considerations: Ensure appropriate sample collection, handling,
and storage to avoid artifacts or degradation of material.

results for Chronic Eosinophilia using specified FISH techniques. Any
deviations from this SOP should be documented, and corrective
actions should be discussed with the supervisor before proceeding
with the analysis.
