Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Chronic Hepatitis B
Monitoring Profile, Serum
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this document is to provide a standardized
protocol for the analytical phase of generating results for
Chronic Hepatitis B Monitoring Profile in serum, ensuring
accuracy, consistency, and reliability of patient results.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to laboratory personnel responsible for
processing, analyzing, and reporting Chronic Hepatitis B
Monitoring Profile results within a CLIA-certified laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all designated laboratory personnel to
follow this protocol and ensure all procedures are performed
accurately and consistently. Supervisors are responsible for
ensuring compliance and proper training of staff.
4. DEFINITIONS
Chronic Hepatitis B Monitoring Profile includes:
◦ Hepatitis B Surface Antigen (HBsAg)
◦ Hepatitis B e Antigen (HBeAg)
◦ Hepatitis B Surface Antibody (anti-HBs)
◦ Hepatitis B e Antibody (anti-HBe)
◦ Hepatitis B Core Antibody (anti-HBc)
◦ Hepatitis B Virus DNA Quantification (HBV DNA)
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
◦ Automated immunoassay analyzer (e.g., Abbott Architect,
Roche Cobas)
◦ Quantitative PCR analyzer for HBV DNA (e.g., Roche
Cobas Ampliprep)
◦ Calibrators and controls specific to each analyte
◦ Pipettes and tips
◦ Centrifuge
◦ Serum separator tubes or plain red top tubes
◦ Personal protective equipment (PPE)
6. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STORAGE
◦ Preferred specimen: Serum
◦ Collection: A minimum of 5 mL of whole blood collected in a
serum separator tube or plain red top tube.
◦ Handling: Allow blood to clot at room temperature, then
centrifuge at 1500-2000 x g for 10-15 minutes.
◦ Storage: Separated serum should be transferred to a
secondary tube if not immediately processed. Store at 2-8°C
if analysis will be performed within 24 hours or -20°C for
longer storage.
7. PROCEDURE:
7.1 Sample Preparation
◦ Verify patient identification and label tubes accordingly.
◦ Centrifuge blood samples to separate serum.
◦ Aliquot serum if necessary and ensure proper labeling.
7.2 Analyzer Setup and Calibration
◦ Ensure the immunoassay and PCR analyzers are properly
powered on and have completed startup checks.
◦ Confirm all reagents, calibrators, and controls are within
expiration dates and loaded into the analyzers according to
manufacturer instructions.
◦ Run calibration and quality control procedures as per
manufacturer's recommendations and document results.
7.3 HBsAg, HBeAg, anti-HBs, anti-HBe, and anti-HBc
Testing
◦ Load patient serum samples onto the automated
immunoassay analyzer.
◦ Select the appropriate assays for HBsAg, HBeAg, anti-HBs,
anti-HBe, and anti-HBc.
◦ Ensure the assay protocols are followed, including proper
incubation times and temperatures.
◦ Upon completion, review and verify initial results output by
the analyzer.
7.4 HBV DNA Quantification
◦ Prepare serum samples for HBV DNA extraction according
to the manual or automated extraction protocol.
◦ Set up the quantitative PCR procedure on the PCR analyzer
by loading the extracted DNA, primers, probes, and master
mix.
◦ Run the PCR amplification process according to the
manufacturer's specifications.
◦ Analyze quantitative results and ensure they fall within the
established curve range.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Run quality control materials with each batch of tests,
including both positive and negative controls.
◦ Document all quality control results in the logbook.
◦ Take appropriate corrective actions for any control results
that fall outside acceptable limits, including repeating tests
and consulting a supervisor.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ Review and verify all patient and control results.
◦ Enter verified results into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
◦ Ensure all results include the necessary interpretive
comments and follow any site-specific reporting guidelines.
◦ Notify the ordering physician of any critical results according
to laboratory policy.
10. REFERENCE INTERVALS
◦ Refer to the specific immunoassay analyzer’s package
insert for the reference intervals and critical values for each
analyte.
11. METHOD LIMITATIONS
◦ Refer to the respective manufacturer's inserts for limitations
associated with each of the assays and HBV DNA PCR
tests.
12. SAFETY AND WASTE DISPOSAL
◦ Personnel must wear appropriate PPE.
◦ Dispose of all biohazard waste and sharps according to
laboratory safety protocols.
