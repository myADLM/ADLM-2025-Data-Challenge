Protocol for the Analytical Phase of Generating Results for
Chronic Hepatitis B Screen, Serum
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this procedure is to outline the
systematic process for the analytical phase of generating
results for Chronic Hepatitis B Screen, utilizing serum
specimens. This protocol ensures accurate, consistent, and
reliable test results.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
• Preferred specimen: Serum, collected in a serum separator tube
(SST) or plain red-top tube.
• Minimum volume: 2 mL serum.
• Stability: Serum specimens are stable for 7 days refrigerated at
2-8°C and may be frozen at -20°C for long-term storage. Avoid
repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
• Unacceptable specimens: Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
Samples that have undergone more than three freeze-thaw
cycles.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Equipment: Centrifuge, refrigerated storage, microplate reader,
and automated immunoassay analyzer.
• Reagents: HBV reagents (HBsAg, Anti-HBc, Anti-HBs kits)
• Supplies: Pipettes, pipette tips, gloves, sample tubes, and
disposable labware.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation
1. Ensure all equipment and reagents are calibrated and within
their expiration date.
2. Perform daily quality control (QC) checks using positive and
negative controls before processing patient specimens.
3. Allow all reagents and specimens to come to room temperature
before use.
B. Specimen Handling and Preparation
1. Confirm that the specimen matches the patient's identification
details.
2. Centrifuge serum separator tubes (SST) at 1500 × g for 10
minutes to separate the serum from cells. Transfer the serum to
a labeled tube if necessary.
C. Immunoassay Analysis for Hepatitis B Surface Antigen
(HBsAg)
1. Load the calibrated immunoassay analyzer with appropriate
reagents and consumables.
2. Load patient serum specimens and QC controls onto the
analyzer according to the manufacturer's instructions.
3. Run the assay as per the analyzer’s protocol.
◦ If the HBsAg test result is positive, the test result should be
reviewed in conjunction with additional screens such as
Anti-HBc and Anti-HBs to confirm chronic Hepatitis B
infection.
D. Additional Antibody Testing (Anti-HBc and Anti-HBs)
1. If HBsAg is positive, perform additional testing for Anti-Hepatitis
B core antibody (Anti-HBc) and Anti-Hepatitis B surface
antibody (Anti-HBs) using similar procedures.
2. Load the analyzer with Anti-HBc and Anti-HBs kits and
calibrated controls.
3. Load the respective serum specimens and QC controls onto the
analyzer as specified in the manufacturer’s protocol.
4. Run the assays and document results.
E. Troubleshooting and Reanalysis
1. If an analyzer reports error codes or out-of-range QC results,
investigate according to the manufacturer's troubleshooting
guide.
2. Re-analyze samples that yield errors or unexpected results.
F. Documentation and Review
1. After obtaining results from the analyzer, verify that all internal
QC criteria are met.
2. Record results in the laboratory information system (LIS)
alongside all QC and calibration data.
3. Any critical or unexpected results should be reviewed and
verified by a senior technologist or supervisor before report
generation.
4. REPORTING RESULTS
5. Results should be automatically or manually (as applicable to
the LIS) transmitted to the LIS for validation.
6. Preliminary positive results or high HBV DNA loads should be
discussed with a clinician for confirmation, and appropriate
follow-up actions should be taken.
7. Validate and verify all data before releasing the final patient
report.
8. QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE
9. Use pre-defined positive and negative quality controls with
every batch of tests.
10. Document all QC and calibrations on the appropriate logs.
11. Participate in external quality assessment (EQA) programs for
hepatitis B screening to ensure the accuracy and reliability of
results.
