Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Chronic Inflammatory
Demyelinating Polyradiculoneuropathy/Nodopathy (CIDP/CIN)
Evaluation in Serum
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to provide a standardized procedure for
the analytical phase of generating results for the evaluation of
Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP)
or Nodopathy (CIN) from serum samples. This procedure ensures
accurate and consistent results in the assessment of CIDP/CIN
through appropriate laboratory testing.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of designated laboratory personnel to perform
and document all procedures for CIDP/CIN evaluation as outlined in
this SOP. Laboratory staff must follow this protocol to ensure the
integrity and reliability of test results.
3. DEFINITIONS
• CIDP/CIN: Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating
Polyradiculoneuropathy/Nodopathy, a neurological disorder
involving inflammation and demyelination of peripheral nerves.
• Serum: The liquid portion of blood obtained after clotting and
centrifugation, used for diagnostic testing.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
• Preferred Specimen: Serum collected in a serum separator tube
(SST).
• Unacceptable Specimens: Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric
samples, or samples containing significant fibrin strands.
• Stability: Serum samples should be refrigerated at 2-8°C and
tested within 48 hours. If long-term storage is required, freeze
aliquots at -20°C or lower.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Centrifuge
• Serum separator tubes (SST)
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Storage racks
• Appropriate assay kits (e.g., ELISA) for anti-neurofascin
antibodies, other relevant biomarkers
• Microplate reader (ELISA reader)
• Deionized water
6. PROCEDURE
6.1 Specimen Preparation
1. Centrifuge the serum separator tube at 1,300 - 1,800 x g for 10
minutes.
2. Carefully remove the serum, avoiding disturbance of the clot or
cells, and transfer to a labeled aliquot tube.
3. Store serum aliquots at 2-8°C for up to 48 hours or freeze at
-20°C for long-term storage.
6.2 Assay Procedure 6.2.1 ELISA for Anti-neurofascin Antibodies
1. Allow all reagents, serum samples, and controls to reach room
temperature before the test begins.
2. Prepare a plate with the appropriate number of wells for
standards, control samples, and patient samples.
3. Dispense the appropriate volume of standards, controls, and
serum samples into the respective wells.
4. Add the enzyme conjugate into each well and incubate at room
temperature for the specified time according to the assay kit
instructions.
5. Wash the wells thoroughly with the wash buffer provided in the
kit to remove unbound material.
6. Add substrate solution to each well and incubate in the dark for
the specified time until a color change is observed.
7. Stop the reaction by adding the stop solution to each well.
8. Read the absorbance on the microplate reader at the
wavelength specified in the kit’s instructions.
6.3 Calibration and Quality Control
1. Perform calibration and daily quality control using the standards
and controls provided in the assay kit.
2. Document all calibration and QC results. Verify that QC results
are within the acceptable range before proceeding with patient
samples.
3. If QC results fall outside the acceptable range, troubleshoot and
resolve issues before reporting patient results.
6.4 Interpretation of Results
1. Calculate the concentration of anti-neurofascin antibodies
present in the patient serum samples using the standard curve
generated from the assay.
2. Compare patient results to the established reference intervals
for the specific assay.
3. Document and review the results for accuracy.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Enter the results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
2. Review and verify results before releasing them to ensure
accuracy and completeness.
3. Report any critical or abnormal findings immediately to the
appropriate healthcare provider.

as necessary to reflect current best practices and technological
advancements.
