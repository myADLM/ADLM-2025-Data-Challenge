STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase for Generating Results for Chronic
Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP)/
Nodopathy Interpretation, Serum
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for the analysis and interpretation of Chronic
Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP)/
Nodopathy in serum samples, ensuring consistent, accurate, and
reliable results.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all clinical laboratory staff trained and authorized
to conduct CIDP/Nodopathy serum analysis within the laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Designated laboratory staff: Conduct analysis, ensure proper
documentation, and manage initial troubleshooting.
• Supervisors: Ensure compliance with SOP, oversee corrective
actions, and provide guidance when required.
• Quality Control Coordinator: Oversee QC procedures and review
QC results.
4. DEFINITIONS
• CIDP: Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating
Polyradiculoneuropathy, a neurological disorder characterized by
progressive weakness and impaired sensory function in the legs
and arms.
• Nodopathy: A related condition that involves pathology of the
nerve roots and peripheral nerves.
• Serum: The liquid component of blood that remains after clotting,
devoid of cells and clotting factors, used for diagnostic testing.
5. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Preparation:
1. Verify the integrity and labeling of the serum specimen.
2. Centrifuge whole blood specimen at 1000-1500 x g for 10
minutes to separate serum. Ensure serum is free of hemolysis.
3. Store serum samples at 2-8°C if analyzing within 48 hours. For
long-term storage, freeze serum at -20°C or lower.
B. Equipment and Reagents:
1. Equipment:
◦ Centrifuge
◦ Automated Immunoassay Analyzer (e.g., ELISA reader)
◦ Pipettes and Tips
◦ Refrigerators/Freezers
2. Reagents:
◦ Specific ELISA kits for CIDP/Nodopathy markers (anti-GM1,
anti-GD1a, anti-GD1b, etc.)
◦ Controls (Positive and Negative)
◦ Calibrators
◦ Substrate solution, wash buffer, and stopping solution
C. Quality Control:
1. Run both positive and negative controls with each batch of
patient samples.
2. Ensure that control results fall within the manufacturer’s
established range.
3. Document all control results and take corrective actions if
results fall outside established ranges.
D. Analytical Procedure:
1. Pre-Analytical Steps:
◦ Ensure all reagents and specimens are at room temperature
before starting.
◦ Prepare the ELISA plate(s) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
◦ Label all samples and controls correctly.
2. Assay Procedure:
◦ Pipette specified volumes of standards, controls, and patient
serum samples into the appropriate wells.
◦ Add reagent to each well according to manufacturer's
protocol.
◦ Incubate plates as directed, maintaining strict timing to
ensure consistency.
◦ Wash plates thoroughly between steps to prevent cross-
contamination.
◦ Add substrate solution to wells and allow the reaction to
develop for specified time.
◦ Stop the reaction by adding stopping solution as prescribed.
3. Reading Results:
◦ Read absorbance at the appropriate wavelength using an
ELISA reader.
◦ Analyze data using the software provided with the ELISA
reader, comparing patient sample values against calibrator
standards.
E. Result Interpretation:
1. Interpret results according to the guidelines provided with the
ELISA kit. Positive results indicate the presence of antibodies
associated with CIDP/Nodopathy.
2. Refer to established reference ranges and diagnostic criteria
when interpreting the assay results.
3. Record and report results in the laboratory information system
(LIS). Validation by a qualified technologist or supervisor is
required before releasing results.
F. Result Reporting:
1. Results should be entered and verified in the LIS.
2. All abnormal and critical results must be reviewed and
confirmed by a senior technologist or supervisor before
releasing.
6. DOCUMENTATION
• Maintain all records of reagent lot numbers, control results,
patient results, and any deviations or incidents that occur during
the analysis process in the laboratory logbook.
• Ensure proper documentation of any corrective actions taken.
7. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's instruction guide for specific ELISA kits used.
• Laboratory Quality Manual and relevant Standard Operating
Procedures.
• Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines on
immunoassay testing.
8. REVISION HISTORY
• Document all revisions, including dates and nature of changes.
This SOP will ensure a consistent and standardized approach to the
analytical phase of generating results for CIDP/Nodopathy
interpretation in serum, promoting high-quality and reliable laboratory
practices.
