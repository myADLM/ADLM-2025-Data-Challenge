Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Chronic Lymphocytic
Leukemia Minimal Residual Disease Detection via Flow Cytometry
1. Purpose The objective of this procedure is to provide a
standardized methodology for the detection and quantification
of minimal residual disease (MRD) in patients with Chronic
Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) using flow cytometry. This SOP
ensures consistency, accuracy, and reliability of results which
are critical for patient monitoring and treatment planning.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing
and documenting the MRD detection assay.
• Supervision and oversight are the responsibility of laboratory
supervisors to ensure compliance with the SOP.
• It is the responsibility of all laboratory staff to report any deviations
or issues encountered during the procedure to a supervisor
promptly.
1. Definitions Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL): A type of
cancer that affects a type of white blood cells called
lymphocytes. Minimal Residual Disease (MRD): Low levels of
cancer cells that remain in a patient following treatment.
2. Specimen Requirements
• Peripheral blood collected in EDTA (lavender-top) tubes.
• Bone marrow aspirate collected in heparinized (green-top) tubes.
• Specimen volume: 5-10 mL.
• Specimen must be processed within 24 hours of collection.
1. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies
• Flow cytometer suitable for MRD analysis.
• Fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies against CD19, CD5, CD23,
CD79b, CD43, and additional markers as required.
• Lyse/Wash buffer.
• Flow cytometry sheath fluid.
• Calibrated pipettes and tips.
• Appropriate control samples (positive and negative controls).
• Data analysis software (e.g., FlowJo, Kaluza).
• Flow cytometry tubes and caps.
• Personal protective equipment (PPE): gloves, lab coat, safety
glasses.
1. Procedure A. Sample Preparation
2. Label flow cytometry tubes with appropriate patient identifiers.
3. Dispense 50-100 µL of whole blood or bone marrow aspirate
into each tube.
4. Add 20 µL of each fluorochrome-conjugated antibody to the
designated tubes. Prepare unstained and single-stained
controls.
5. Incubate samples at room temperature, in the dark, for 15-20
minutes.
6. Add 2 mL of lyse/wash buffer to each tube and incubate for
10-15 minutes to lyse red blood cells.
7. Centrifuge tubes at 500 x g for 5 minutes at room temperature.
8. Carefully aspirate the supernatant, leaving the cell pellet
undisturbed.
9. Resuspend the cell pellet in 500 µL of sheath fluid.
10. Vortex tubes gently to ensure a homogenous suspension.
B. Flow Cytometry Acquisition
1. Perform instrument calibration and compensation using
appropriate controls.
2. Acquire at least 200,000 cell events per tube to ensure
adequate data for MRD analysis.
3. Use forward and side scatter to gate on the lymphocyte
population.
4. Record fluorescence data for each marker.
C. Data Analysis
1. Open acquired data files in the flow cytometry analysis
software.
2. Apply gates to define the lymphocyte population based on
forward and side scatter properties.
3. Identify and gate on specific CLL MRD populations using CD19,
CD5, CD23, CD79b, CD43, and other markers.
4. Compare marker expression patterns with positive and negative
controls to ensure specificity.
5. Quantify the proportion of MRD cells in the sample.
6. Double-check results and review gating strategy to confirm
accuracy.
7. Quality Control
8. Perform daily flow cytometer QC checks using calibration
beads.
9. Include appropriate control samples (positive and negative) in
each run to validate assay performance.
10. Review QC results before reporting patient results. Repeat the
assay if controls fail acceptance criteria.
11. Maintain a log of QC results and any corrective actions taken.
12. Reporting Results
13. Document all findings in the laboratory information system
(LIS).
14. Report MRD results as the percentage of total lymphocytes.
15. Include a detailed interpretation of the results and any relevant
clinical recommendations.
16. Ensure results are reviewed and verified by a qualified
laboratory supervisor before release.

1. Method Limitations
• MRD detection sensitivity is dependent on sample quality, reagent
performance, and instrument calibration.
• Variability in marker expression among patients may impact the
accuracy of MRD quantification.
This SOP should be reviewed and updated annually or when new
guidelines or instrumentation changes occur. Ensure all laboratory
personnel are trained on the latest version of this SOP.
