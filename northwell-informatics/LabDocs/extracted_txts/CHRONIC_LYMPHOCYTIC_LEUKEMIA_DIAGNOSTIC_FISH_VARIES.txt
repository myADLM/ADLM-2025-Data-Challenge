STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE
CHRONIC LYMPHOCYTIC LEUKEMIA (CLL) DIAGNOSTIC FISH
ANALYSIS PROTOCOL
1. PURPOSE
This SOP provides a standardized procedure for the analysis and
reporting of Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) using
Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH). The protocol includes
steps from slide preparation to interpretation and documentation of
results. The goal is to ensure accurate, reliable, and reproducible
results, essential for the diagnosis and management of CLL patients.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to the analysis phase of CLL diagnostic testing
using FISH in a CLIA-certified laboratory. This includes analyzing
patient samples, identifying chromosomal abnormalities specific to
CLL, and generating diagnostic reports.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
Qualified laboratory personnel are responsible for performing FISH
analysis on CLL samples. Laboratory supervisors are responsible for
reviewing and validating the results, ensuring they comply with
quality control standards, and reporting to the referring physician or
healthcare provider.
4. DEFINITIONS
• FISH (Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization): A molecular
cytogenetic technique used to detect and localize the presence or
absence of specific DNA sequences on chromosomes.
• CLL (Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia): A type of cancer that
starts from cells becoming cancerous and growing uncontrollably
in the bone marrow and then into the blood.
5. EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS
• Fluorescence microscope
• Thermocycler
• Slide hybridizer
• FISH probes specific to CLL (e.g., ATM, TP53, D12Z3, D13S319,
LSI IGH/CCND1 dual-color, etc.)
• Fluorescent-labeled probes (spectrum orange, spectrum green,
spectrum aqua, etc.)
• Sample slides pre-treated for FISH
• Related reagents (fixatives, pre-treatment solutions, hybridization
buffer, wash buffers, mounting medium with DAPI)
6. PROCEDURE
6.1 Sample Preparation
1. Obtain bone marrow or peripheral blood samples from patients
suspected of having CLL.
2. Prepare cell suspensions and fix cells on positively charged
slides following the laboratory standard protocol.
3. Age the slides for 2 hours at 60°C or overnight at 37°C.
6.2 Probe Preparation
1. Thaw FISH probes specific to CLL at room temperature.
2. Mix 1μl of labeled probe with 9μl of hybridization buffer ensuring
a thorough mix.
6.3 Denaturation and Hybridization
1. Denature slides at 75°C for 2 minutes.
2. Apply 10μl probe mix to each slide and cover with a glass
coverslip.
3. Seal with rubber cement and place slides in a hybridizer.
4. Hybridize overnight at 37°C in a humidified chamber.
6.4 Post-Hybridization Washes
1. Remove coverslip and wash slides in 0.4x SSC/0.3% NP-40 at
73±1°C for 2 minutes.
2. Immediately follow with a wash in 2x SSC/0.1% NP-40 at room
temperature for 1 minute.
3. Air-dry the slides in a dark environment.
6.5 Counterstaining and Mounting
1. Counterstain with DAPI (4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) and
place a coverslip using an antifade mounting medium.
6.6 Analysis
1. Analyze slides using a fluorescence microscope with
appropriate filter sets.
2. Scan and enumerate 200 interphase cells per specific probe.
3. Identify and record the presence or absence of probe signals,
considering standard diagnostic criteria for CLL.
4. Any discrepancies between signals should be documented and
analyzed thoroughly.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Include control samples known to have specific abnormalities to
ensure assay performance.
2. Regularly calibrate and maintain fluorescence microscopes.
3. Review and validate results by a second qualified technologist
or supervisor.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Results should be interpreted according to the International
System for Human Cytogenomic Nomenclature (ISCN).
2. Document the findings and prepare a comprehensive report
that includes:
◦ Patient information
◦ Summary of results
◦ Interpretation and clinical relevance of detected
abnormalities
◦ Any limitations or potential interferences noticed during
analysis.

Calibrated reference materials and manufacturer instructions for
FISH probes and equipment must be thoroughly consulted and
adhered to.
