Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) Title: Analytical Phase
Protocol for Generating Results for Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia
(CLL), Specified Fluorescence In-Situ Hybridization (FISH) Analysis
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to establish a uniform and standardized
procedure for performing FISH analysis to detect chromosomal
abnormalities associated with Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL)
in patient samples. This ensures accuracy, reliability, and consistency
in generating and reporting FISH results in accordance with
regulatory and quality standards.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to laboratory personnel trained to perform FISH
analysis in a clinical diagnostic laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Trained laboratory personnel are responsible for conducting FISH
analysis and documenting the results accurately.
• The laboratory supervisor is responsible for ensuring that the
procedure is followed, verifying the results, and addressing any
issues that arise during the procedure.
4. DEFINITIONS
• FISH: A molecular cytogenetic technique that uses fluorescent
probes binding to specific DNA sequences, allowing for the
detection of chromosomal abnormalities.
• CLL: Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia, a type of cancer that affects
a particular lymphocyte subtype.
• Probe: A fluorescently labeled DNA segment used to identify
specific chromosomal regions.
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Type: Peripheral blood, bone marrow aspirates, or lymph node
biopsies.
• Collection: Samples should be collected in sterile containers with
heparin or EDTA anticoagulant.
• Transport and Storage: Transport specimens to the laboratory at
room temperature as soon as possible. Store at 2-8°C if there is a
delay.
6. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Equipment:
◦ Fluorescence microscope equipped with appropriate filters
◦ Incubator (37°C)
◦ Centrifuge
◦ Hybridization chamber
◦ Imaging software
• Reagents:
◦ FISH probes specific for CLL (e.g., 13q14, 11q22.3, 17p13.1,
trisomy 12)
◦ Hybridization buffer
◦ Fixative (e.g., methanol:acetic acid, 3:1)
◦ DAPI or another nuclear counterstain
◦ Mounting media
• Supplies:
◦ Glass slides and coverslips
◦ Pipettes and pipette tips
◦ Absorbent wipes and gloves
◦ Ethanol
7. PROCEDURE
Preparation of Sample:
1. Cell Preparation:
◦ Process the specimen (blood/marrow/lymph node) to obtain
a single-cell suspension.
◦ Centrifuge at 500 x g for 5 minutes and discard the
supernatant.
◦ Resuspend the cell pellet in hypotonic solution (0.075 M
KCl) and incubate at 37°C for 20 minutes to swell the cells.
◦ Centrifuge at 500 x g for 5 minutes and remove the
supernatant.
◦ Fix the cells in freshly prepared fixative (methanol:acetic
acid, 3:1) dropwise while gently vortexing. Repeat the
fixation step twice.
2. Slide Preparation:
◦ Place a few drops of the fixed cell suspension onto clean
glass slides and air dry.
◦ Age slides at room temperature for at least 24 hours or at
60°C for 2 hours.
Probe Hybridization:
1. Pre-Treatment:
◦ Denature slides in 70% formamide at 73°C for 5 minutes.
◦ Dehydrate through an ethanol series (70%, 85%, 100%, 2
minutes each) and air dry.
2. Hybridization:
◦ Apply the appropriate FISH probe mixture to each slide.
◦ Cover the probe with a coverslip and seal with rubber
cement.
◦ Denature the probe and slide together at 75°C for 5
minutes.
◦ Incubate slides in a humidified chamber at 37°C overnight
(16-20 hours).
3. Post-Hybridization Wash:
◦ Remove coverslip and rinse slides in 2x SSC at room
temperature.
◦ Perform stringent washes in 0.4x SSC/0.3% NP-40 at 73°C
for 2 minutes and 2x SSC/0.1% NP-40 at room temperature
for 1 minute.
4. Counterstaining:
◦ Apply DAPI (or another nuclear counterstain) to each slide
and coverslip.
◦ Allow the slides to air dry in the dark.
Microscopy and Analysis:
1. Fluorescence Microscopy:
◦ Using a fluorescence microscope, examine slides for
specific hybridization signals.
◦ Capture images of cells using imaging software.
2. Analysis:
◦ Analyze at least 200 interphase nuclei for the presence or
absence of FISH signals.
◦ Record results, noting normal and abnormal signal patterns.
Quality Control:
1. Quality Control Measures:
◦ Include positive and negative control slides with each batch
of tests.
◦ Document QC results and ensure that controls are within
acceptable limits before proceeding with sample analysis.
Interpretation and Reporting:
1. Interpretation:
◦ Evaluate the results based on the observed fluorescent
signal patterns.
◦ Classify results according to established criteria for CLL
chromosomal abnormalities.
2. Reporting:
◦ Draft the report including the number of cells analyzed, type
and number of anomalies observed, and any relevant
interpretations.
◦ Review and verify the report by a qualified supervisor or
technologist.
◦ Transmit results to the LIS for clinician review.
8. SAFETY PRECAUTIONS
• Follow all laboratory safety protocols, including the use of
personal protective equipment (PPE), biosafety cabinets, and
proper waste disposal procedures.
• Handle all specimens as potentially infectious.

troubleshooting guides.
