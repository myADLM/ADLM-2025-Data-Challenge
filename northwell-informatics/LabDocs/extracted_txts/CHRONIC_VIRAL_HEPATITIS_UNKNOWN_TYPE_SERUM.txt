Standard Operating Procedure for Analytical Phase of Generating
Results for CHRONIC VIRAL HEPATITIS (UNKNOWN TYPE),
SERUM
1. PURPOSE
To provide clear and detailed steps for the analytical phase in the
detection and identification of chronic viral hepatitis (unknown type) in
serum samples. This SOP outlines the methods, equipment,
reagents, protocol, quality control, and reporting guidelines for
accurate test results.
Responsibility:
All laboratory personnel conducting the tests are responsible for
adhering to this SOP and ensuring accuracy and reliability of test
results. Supervisors are responsible for overseeing adherence,
performing validations, and addressing any issues.
1. SPECIMEN
Specimen Type:
• Preferred: Serum samples.
Specimen Collection:
• Collect blood using standard venipuncture technique.
• Allow blood to clot at room temperature.
• Centrifuge the sample to separate serum within one hour of
collection.
• Transfer the serum into a clean, labeled tube.
Specimen Handling:
• Store specimen at 2-8°C if not tested immediately.
• For long-term storage, freeze the serum at -20°C or below. Avoid
repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
• Ensure all samples are adequately labeled with patient
identification and collection details.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
• Samples not properly labeled or showing signs of contamination.
• Samples with insufficient volume.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes and tips
• Automated immunoassay analyzer or manual ELISA system
• Incubator
• Plate washer (if manual ELISA)
Reagents:
• Viral hepatitis panel kits (including HBsAg, Anti-HCV, Anti-HAV,
etc.)
• Calibrators and controls
• Wash buffer
• Substrate solution
• Stop solution
• Disposable gloves and lab coats
• Alcohol wipes
Supplies:
• Microtiter plates
• Microcentrifuge tubes
• Eppendorf tubes
1. PROCEDURE
4.1 Pre-analytical Checks
• Verify patient identification and sample details in Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
• Inspect the serum sample for suitability.
4.2 Analytical Method
A) Automated Immunoassay Analyzer:
1. Calibration and Preparation a. Calibrate the analyzer as per
manufacturer’s instructions. b. Load required reagents and
calibrators.
2. Loading Samples a. Program the analyzer with patient
information. b. Load serum samples in designated positions.
3. Running the Assay a. Select the viral hepatitis panel protocol. b.
Initiate the run, ensuring all controls and calibrators are
processed.
4. Result Generation a. Allow the analyzer to complete the run. b.
Ensure that all controls are within acceptable ranges. c.
Generate results and review for correctness.
B) Manual ELISA Method:
1. Plate Preparation a. Add 100 µL of serum to designated wells.
b. Add negative, positive controls, and calibrators in designated
wells.
2. Incubation a. Incubate plates at the specified temperature for
designated time.
3. Washing a. Wash plates using automated plate washer or
manual washing techniques.
4. Addition of Conjugate a. Add enzyme conjugate to each well
and incubate for specified time.
5. Substrate Addition and Color Development a. Add substrate
solution and incubate as per protocol to allow color
development. b. Add stop solution to halt the reaction at the
specified time.
6. Reading the Plates a. Read the optical density (OD) at the
specified wavelength using a plate reader. b. Compare patient
OD values against calibrator values to determine positivity.
4.3 Result Interpretation
• Follow assay-specific cut-offs provided in the kit insert for HBsAg,
Anti-HCV, Anti-HAV, etc.
• Interpret each result according to the reference ranges and cut-off
values.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run internal quality control samples along with patient specimens.
• Quality control samples must be within the acceptable range
before reporting patient results.
• Document all QC results and troubleshoot any failures as
necessary.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Ensure proper verification by a qualified laboratorian before
releasing results.
Critical Values:
• Any critical or highly abnormal results should be communicated
immediately to the requesting clinician.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the specific assay reagent insert and product documentation
for any method limitations, such as cross-reactivity, interferences, or
sample stability.

• Manufacturer's product insert for specific assay kits.
• Laboratory Quality Manual.
• CLIA regulations.
1. DOCUMENTATION
• Log details of sample processing and results in the lab record.
• Maintain records of all calibrations, QC, and maintenance
activities.
