Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Chub Mackerel IgE, Serum
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedure for the accurate
and reliable analysis of Chub Mackerel IgE in serum samples. This
protocol ensures that results are consistently generated following
defined procedures to maintain high-quality standards and
compliance with regulatory requirements.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
The designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing
the analysis as per the procedure outlined. All laboratory staff must
identify any deviations or anomalies during the process and report
them to their supervisor. It is the responsibility of the staff and
supervisors to ensure all analyses are performed, documented, and
reviewed according to the SOP.
1. DEFINITION
Chub Mackerel IgE: Immunoglobulin E specific to Chub Mackerel, an
allergen often tested to diagnose fish allergy in patients.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred Specimen:
◦ Serum
◦ Collected in a red-top or serum separator tube (SST)
◦ Minimum volume: 1 mL
• Unacceptable Specimens:
◦ Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples
◦ Specimens collected in anticoagulant tubes (e.g., EDTA,
heparin)
◦ Specimens that do not meet volume requirements
• Storage and Stability:
◦ Serum samples kept at 2-8°C are stable for up to 72 hours.
◦ For longer storage, freeze samples at -20°C or lower, where
they are stable for up to 6 months.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) kit specific for
Chub Mackerel IgE
• Microplate reader capable of reading at 450 nm with 620-650 nm
reference filter
• Pipettes (single and multichannel)
• Microcentrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Deionized water
• Calibrated timers
• Disposable pipette tips
• Plate washer (automated or manual)
• Reagents as provided in the ELISA kit:
◦ Coated microtiter plate
◦ Standards and control sera
◦ Wash buffer
◦ Enzyme conjugate
◦ Substrate solution
◦ Stop solution
1. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation of Reagents:
• Allow all reagents and samples to reach room temperature
(20-25°C) before use.
• Prepare wash buffer as indicated in the kit instructions.
• Follow kit instructions to prepare standards and control sera.
B) Assay Procedure:
1. Label strips needed for the assay and place them in the frame.
2. Pipet 100 µL of each standard, control, and sample into the
assigned well.
3. Incubate the plate at room temperature for 1 hour.
4. Wash the plate thoroughly with wash buffer using a plate
washer or manually.
5. Add 100 µL of enzyme conjugate into each well.
6. Incubate the plate at room temperature for 30 minutes.
7. Wash the plate thoroughly with wash buffer.
8. Add 100 µL of substrate solution to each well.
9. Incubate the plate in the dark at room temperature for 10-15
minutes.
10. Add 100 µL of stop solution to each well to terminate the
reaction.
11. Measure the absorbance at 450 nm with a reference filter set at
620-650 nm using a microplate reader.
C) Result Calculation:
1. Generate a standard curve by plotting the absorbance of
standards versus their concentration.
2. Determine the concentration of Chub Mackerel IgE in the
samples by interpolation using the standard curve.
3. Ensure data falls within the linear range of the assay.
D) Quality Control:
• Verify that all controls fall within the predetermined ranges. If
controls are out of range, do not report results and troubleshoot
as necessary.
• Run quality controls and maintain logs to monitor assay
performance.
E) Reporting Results:
• Results should be reviewed and verified before reporting.
• Utilize the laboratory information system (LIS) to document and
finalize results.
• Report results in IU/mL, as indicated by the standards provided in
the ELISA kit.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Reference intervals should be established based on population
studies and validated for laboratory use.
1. LIMITATIONS
• Ensure samples are not contaminated and follow specified
storage conditions.
• Cross-reactivity with other fish allergens or proteins may occur;
interpret results in the clinical context.
1. REFERENCES
• ELISA kit manufacturer’s instructions and product insert.
• Relevant peer-reviewed literature on Chub Mackerel IgE testing
and clinical implications.
By adhering to this SOP, laboratory personnel can ensure the
consistent, accurate, and reliable generation of Chub Mackerel IgE
results, upholding the highest standards of laboratory practice.
