Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Chylomicrons, Plasma
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to detail the procedures for the accurate
measurement, analysis, and reporting of chylomicrons in plasma
samples. This protocol ensures consistent and reliable results that
conform with CLIA standards.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of trained laboratory personnel to carry out the
procedure as described below and to ensure quality control
measures are in place. Supervisors must oversee proper execution.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
◦ Preferred Specimen: Plasma collected in an EDTA or
heparinized tube.
◦ Volume: Minimum 1 mL of plasma required for analysis.
◦ Stability: Plasma should be separated from whole blood
within 2 hours of collection and can be stored at 2-8°C for
up to 48 hours or frozen at -20°C for up to 1 month.
2. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
1. Ultracentrifuge
2. Centrifuge tubes
3. Pipettes and tips
4. Reagents for Chylomicron determination (commercially
available Chylomicron assay kit)
5. Biochemical analyzer compatible with the chosen
Chylomicron assay kit
6. Sample tubes
7. Personal protective equipment (PPE)
3. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Preparation
1. Ensure plasma samples are properly labeled and stored as described.
2. If the sample is frozen, thaw at room temperature and mix gently before analysis.
3. Centrifuge plasma samples at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes to remove any remaining cellular components.
B. Ultracentrifugation
1. Transfer the necessary volume of plasma to appropriate ultracentrifuge tubes.
2. Prepare the ultracentrifuge according to the manufacturer's instructions.
3. Centrifuge the samples at 100,000 x g for 1 hour at 4°C to separate chylomicrons.
4. Carefully remove the top layer where chylomicrons are concentrated using a pipette.
C. Chylomicron Analysis
1. Follow the protocol provided with the Chylomicron assay kit. This may include specific reagent preparation, sample additions, incubation times, and measurements.
2. Load samples and controls into the biochemical analyzer.
3. Perform the analysis following the instrument and assay kit instructions.
D. Quality Control
1. Run external and internal quality control samples with each batch of patient samples.
2. Document all quality control results and ensure they fall within acceptable ranges before reporting patient results.
3. If quality control results are outside acceptable limits, troubleshoot and resolve issues before proceeding with sample analysis.
4. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ Chylomicron concentration results will be reviewed by the
technologist.
◦ Results are reported in mg/dL or as specified by the assay
kit.
◦ Critical values should be immediately reported to the
requesting clinician per laboratory SOP.
◦ Results must be entered into the Laboratory Information
System (LIS) and verified by a supervising technologist.
5. MAINTENANCE AND CALIBRATION
◦ Regularly scheduled maintenance and calibration of the
ultracentrifuge and biochemical analyzer must be performed
as per the manufacturer's guidelines.
◦ Document all maintenance and calibration activities.
6. REFERENCES
◦ Chylomicron Assay Kit Product Insert
◦ Ultracentrifuge User's Manual
◦ Biochemical Analyzer User's Manual
◦ Current CLIA Standards and Regulations
7. RECORD KEEPING
◦ Maintain logs of sample analysis, quality control results,
maintenance, and calibration activities.
◦ Ensure all records are accurate, clear, and retrievable for
audit purposes.
By following this SOP, laboratory personnel will ensure the accurate
and reliable measurement of chylomicrons in plasma samples,
thereby providing essential information for patient diagnosis and
treatment.
