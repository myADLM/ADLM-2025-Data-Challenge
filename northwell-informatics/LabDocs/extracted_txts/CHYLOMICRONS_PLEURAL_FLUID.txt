Protocol for Analytical Phase of Generating Results for Chylomicrons
in Pleural Fluid
1. PURPOSE To outline the procedures involved in the analytical
phase of generating results for chylomicrons analysis in pleural
fluid samples, including specimen requirements, equipment and
reagents, procedure, quality control, and reporting results.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY Specimen
Type:
◦ Pleural fluid (ensure it is properly labeled with the patient's
information and collection date/time)
Specimen Collection:
◦ Collect pleural fluid aseptically using a sterile syringe and
appropriate needle.
◦ Transfer pleural fluid into a sterile container. Ensure the
container is properly labeled.
Specimen Storage:
◦ Store pleural fluid samples at 2-8°C if analysis will be
performed within 24 hours.
◦ If analysis will be delayed, freeze the pleural fluid at -20°C
or lower to preserve chylomicrons.
Unacceptable Specimens:
◦ Samples with visible contamination or hemolysis.
◦ Samples without proper labeling or collection details.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
◦ Centrifuge (capable of reaching 3000 rpm)
◦ Microscope with appropriate lenses
◦ Centrifuge tubes
◦ Serum-separating tubes (SST)
◦ Staining reagents (e.g., Sudan III stain for lipid detection)
◦ Glass slides and coverslips
◦ Pipettes and pipette tips
◦ Personal protective equipment (PPE)
4. PROCEDURE A) Sample Preparation
1. Centrifuge the pleural fluid sample at 3000 rpm for 10
minutes to separate the cellular components.
2. Carefully transfer the supernatant to another sterile
container without disturbing the pellet.
B) Chylomicrons Analysis
1. Prepare a smear of the supernatant on a glass slide.
2. Allow the smear to air dry completely.
3. Stain the smear with Sudan III stain to detect the
presence of chylomicrons.
▪ Place a few drops of Sudan III stain on the smear and
allow it to sit for 3-5 minutes.
▪ Rinse the slide gently with distilled water and allow it
to air dry.
4. Examine the slide under the microscope at 40x and 100x
magnifications for the presence of chylomicrons (lipid
droplets stained red-orange).
5. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Include positive and negative control slides in each batch of
staining to ensure staining quality and accuracy.
◦ Record all control results and take corrective action if
controls are out of range before analyzing patient samples.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ Review and interpret the stained smear for the presence of
chylomicrons.
◦ If chylomicrons are present, report as "Chylomicrons
detected in pleural fluid."
◦ If chylomicrons are absent, report as "No chylomicrons
detected in pleural fluid."
Critical Values and Notifications:
◦ Any critical findings (e.g., high presence of chylomicrons)
should be communicated promptly to the ordering physician.
Documentation:
◦ Ensure all findings, including the patient’s identification,
specimen details, and results, are documented accurately in
the laboratory information system (LIS).

◦ Laboratory guidelines and best practices for pleural fluid
analysis.

and consistent analysis of chylomicrons in pleural fluid, contributing
to accurate and timely diagnosis and patient care.
