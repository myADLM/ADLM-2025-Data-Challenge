Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
CHYLURIA SCREEN, RANDOM URINE
1. PURPOSE To provide standardized procedures for the
analytical phase of generating results for chyluria screening in
random urine specimens.
Responsibility: Qualified laboratory personnel are responsible for
performing the test, interpreting results, and ensuring all steps are
followed per this SOP.
1. DEFINITION Chyluria refers to the presence of chyle in the
urine, often indicated by a milky or foamy appearance resulting
from the presence of lymphatic fluid.
2. PROCEDURE
Specimen:
• Preferred/acceptable: 10 mL freshly voided random urine
collected in a sterile container.
• Unacceptable: Specimens with no collection date/time indicated
or improperly labeled containers.
Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies:
• Optical microscope
• Centrifuge
• 10 mL conical centrifuge tubes
• Lipid stain (Sudan III or Oil Red O)
• Glass slides
• Cover slips
• Sterile droppers or pipettes
Procedure:
1. Specimen Preparation: a. Ensure specimen container is labeled
correctly with patient information. b. Inspect the collected urine
specimen for a milky or foamy appearance which may be
indicative of chyle.
2. Centrifugation: a. Transfer approximately 10 mL of urine to a
conical centrifuge tube. b. Centrifuge the urine specimen at
1500-2000 RPM for 10 minutes to separate the supernatant
and sediment.
3. Staining: a. Decant the supernatant carefully and suspend the
sediment in a small volume of saline. b. Place a drop of the
sediment on the glass slide using a sterile dropper or pipet. c.
Add a drop of lipid stain (Sudan III or Oil Red O) to the
sediment on the slide. d. Place a cover slip over the stained
sediment.
4. Microscopy: a. Examine the slide under the high magnification
(40X) of an optical microscope. b. Look for the presence of
round, refractile fat globules that are stained red, indicative of
chyle presence.
5. Interpretation of Results: a. Positive Result: Presence of
characteristic fat globules in the stained slide preparation. b.
Negative Result: Absence of characteristic fat globules in the
stained slide preparation.
Quality Control:
• Regular calibration of the optical microscope.
• Use of control slides with known positive and negative results to
ensure staining and identification accuracy.
• Ensure centrifuge is operating within specified RPM and time
frame regularly.
Reporting Results:
• Positive Result: "Chyluria detected."
• Negative Result: "Chyluria not detected."
• Results must be reviewed and verified by the laboratory
technologist before reporting.
• Document results, including date, time, and initials of the
technologist performing the analysis in the LIS (Laboratory
Information System).
Reference Intervals:
• No reference intervals applicable; the test is qualitative.
Method Limitations:
• Specimen appearance may vary; presence of other substances
can interfere with visual inspection.
• False negatives can occur if the urine does not contain chyle at
the time of collection.
References:
• Manufacturer's guidelines for lipid stains (Sudan III/Oil Red O).
• Laboratory internal SOPs for microscopy and staining procedures.
Note: Updates to this protocol should be documented and reviewed
according to laboratory standards and regulations.
By following this SOP, laboratory personnel will ensure accurate and
consistent results for chyluria screening in random urine specimens.
