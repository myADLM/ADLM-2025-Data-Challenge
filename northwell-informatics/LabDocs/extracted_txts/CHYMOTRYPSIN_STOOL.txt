Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Title: Analytical Phase Protocol
for Generating Results for Chymotrypsin, Stool
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the protocol for the analytical
phase of generating results for chymotrypsin in stool samples. This
ensures accurate and reproducible results, maintaining the quality
and reliability of laboratory testing.
Responsibility: Trained laboratory technologists are responsible for
performing and documenting the analysis of stool chymotrypsin tests
according to this procedure. It is the responsibility of all staff to follow
these procedures accurately and to report any deviations or issues to
a supervisor.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/Acceptable Specimen:
• Stool sample collected in a clean, dry container without
preservatives.
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Specimens contaminated with urine or water.
• Specimens not appropriately labeled or not received at the
laboratory within the specified stability and transport guidelines.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Centrifuge
• Micropipettes and tips
• Vortex mixer
• Water bath or incubator set at 37°C
• Chymotrypsin Assay Kit
• Disposable gloves and lab coats
• Stool sample containers
1. QUALITY CONTROL
Quality control materials should be run daily or with each batch of
patient samples. Use high, low, and negative controls provided by or
recommended by the manufacturer to ensure the accuracy of the
assay.
1. PROCEDURE
2. Stool Sample Preparation: a. Bring the stool sample to room
temperature if it was refrigerated. b. Homogenize the stool
specimen thoroughly. c. Weigh out an appropriate amount of
stool sample as recommended by the Chymotrypsin Assay Kit
insert.
3. Chymotrypsin Assay: a. Prepare the stool extract according to
the kit manufacturer’s instructions. b. Prepare the reagents and
controls as per the assay kit insert. c. Pipette the stool extract
and controls into the appropriate assay wells. d. Add the
substrate to the wells as instructed by the assay kit. e. Incubate
the assay plate or tubes at 37°C for the time specified in the
assay kit instructions.
4. Measurement: a. Measure the absorbance of the wells at the
wavelength specified by the assay kit using a
spectrophotometer. b. Record the absorbance values for each
sample, control, and standard.
5. Calculation of Results: a. Calculate the chymotrypsin activity for
each stool sample using the standard curve generated from the
known standards provided in the assay kit. b. Convert the
absorbance readings into concentration units (e.g., U/g stool)
based on the assay kit instructions and the standard curve.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
Reporting:
• Enter the calculated chymotrypsin activity values into the
Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Review and verify results by a technologist before releasing them
into the patient's medical record.
Reference Intervals:
• Negative: < A specific value (as specified by the manufacturer or
laboratory validation)
• Positive: ≥ A specific value (as specified by the manufacturer or
laboratory validation)
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to the Chymotrypsin Assay Kit insert for specific limitations
and interfering substances that may affect the assay's
performance.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If control results fall outside the established ranges, do not report
patient results. Investigate and resolve control failures according
to the manufacturer's guidelines and lab protocol.
• If any technical errors or unexpected results are encountered,
repeat the test and verify with a supervisor if needed.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's instruction manual for the Chymotrypsin Assay Kit.
• Laboratory's internal documents and guidelines.
1. DOCUMENTATION
Maintain records of:
• Lot numbers and expiration dates of reagents and kits used.
• Quality control data.
• Patient results and any corrective actions taken.
This SOP will be reviewed annually and updated as necessary to
reflect current practices or to incorporate new information.
