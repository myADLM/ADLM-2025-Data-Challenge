Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase:
Generating Results for CINNAMON, IGE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
This procedure outlines the steps necessary to generate and report
results for CINNAMON, IgE, and SERUM analysis in a Clinical
Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-certified laboratory.
The goal is to ensure accurate, consistent, and timely results.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
All designated laboratory personnel are responsible for following this
SOP to generate results for CINNAMON, IgE, and SERUM analysis.
It is also the responsibility of laboratory supervisors to ensure the
SOP is adhered to and to address any issues that may arise.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen Type:
◦ For CINNAMON and IgE analysis: Serum collected in a
serum separator tube (SST).
◦ For general SERUM analysis: Serum collected in a serum
separator tube (SST).
Stability:
◦ Specimen must be transported to the laboratory promptly
and stored at 2-8°C if analysis is not performed immediately.
◦ Serum specimens are stable for up to 48 hours at 2-8°C.
2. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
◦ ELISA kits for CINNAMON-specific IgE detection
◦ Automated Immunoassay Analyzers (e.g., Tecan,
Biomerieux)
◦ Calibrated laboratory pipettes
◦ Serum separator tubes (SST)
◦ Quality control materials (negative and positive controls)
◦ Disposable gloves, lab coats, eye protection
◦ Lab timer
3. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation
1. Verify specimen integrity:
▪ Check for proper labeling.
▪ Ensure specimen is within acceptable transport and
stability time frame.
▪ Inspect specimen visually for hemolysis or clotting;
reject if unacceptable.
B) CINNAMON and IgE Analysis
1. Calibrate ELISA reader according to manufacturer’s
instructions.
2. Prepare reagents according to ELISA kit instructions;
warm to room temperature.
3. Set up and prepare the plate with standards, controls, and
patient samples.
4. Apply serum samples and reagent solutions to
corresponding wells.
5. Incubate the plate as specified in the ELISA instructions
(typically 30-60 minutes).
6. Wash wells according to ELISA kit protocol.
7. Add the substrate solution to each well and incubate
(typically 15-30 mins) until color change is visible.
8. Measure optical density using ELISA plate reader.
9. Calculate the concentration of CINNAMON-specific IgE
using software.
C) Reporting Results
1. Verify that each well was processed properly and quality
control standards were met.
2. Calculate final CINNAMON IgE levels based on standard
curves.
3. Confirm results against control ranges.
4. Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
for CINNAMON and IgE.
D) General SERUM Analysis
1. Centrifuge the SST if necessary.
2. Apply serum sample to the automated analyzer following
the manufacturer's protocol.
3. Perform analysis according to the instrument’s procedure.
4. Validate and review results:
▪ Compare results with quality controls.
▪ Confirm precision and accuracy by running duplicate
samples if necessary.
5. Input results into LIS.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Include appropriate positive and negative controls with each
batch of samples.
◦ Validate calibration curves regularly and check instrument
maintenance logs.
◦ Periodically perform proficiency testing and inter-lab
comparisons.
5. METHOD LIMITATIONS
◦ Interferences may be caused by high levels of lipids or
hemolysis.
◦ Results can vary based on non-standard specimen
handling.
◦ Cross-reactivity with other allergens could affect
CINNAMON-specific IgE interpretation.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ Ensure all patient results are reviewed and verified by a
qualified technologist.
◦ Report findings in compliance with laboratory protocol and
handle critical values according to laboratory SOP.
◦ Reference Interval:
▪ CINNAMON IgE: Specific to kit insert.
▪ IgE: Typical reference range provided by the
manufacturer.
▪ General serum analysis values: Refer to established lab
reference intervals.
7. REFERENCES
◦ Manufacturer’s guide for the ELISA kits used.
◦ Instrument manuals for automated analyzers.
◦ Lab-specific protocols for serum analysis.
By following this SOP, laboratory personnel will be able to generate
reliable results for CINNAMON, IgE, and SERUM analysis in
compliance with CLIA standards.
