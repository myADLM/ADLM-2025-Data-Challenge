Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Cinnamon IgG Analysis
1. PURPOSE To outline the steps involved in generating accurate
and reliable results for Cinnamon IgG levels in patient
specimens through analysis in a CLIA-certified laboratory.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY Preferred
Specimen:
• Serum or plasma collected using standard phlebotomy
techniques.
• SST (Serum Separator Tube) or plasma collection tube.
Specimen Stability:
• Specimens must be refrigerated (2-8°C) and are stable for up to
72 hours post-collection.
• Serum/plasma can be frozen at -20°C for longer-term storage up
to 1 month.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens that have been hemolyzed, contaminated, or
improperly stored.
• Specimens received in tubes other than SST or plasma collection
tubes.
• Specimens without proper labeling (patient identification,
collection date/time).
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• ELISA reader (microplate spectrophotometer)
• Microplate Washer
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• ELISA kit for Cinnamon IgG detection (store kit at 2-8°C as per
manufacturer’s guidelines)
• Plate shaker (optional)
• Timer
• Calibrated traceable thermometer
• Laboratory gloves, goggles, and lab coat
1. PROCEDURE A. Preparation:
2. Bring all reagents and samples to room temperature (20-25°C)
before use.
3. Set up ELISA reader and microplate washer according to
manufacturer instructions.
B. Sample Dilution: 3. Dilute each serum/plasma sample 1:200 in the
sample diluent provided in the ELISA kit.
• Example: Mix 10 µL of serum/plasma with 1990 µL of sample
diluent.
C. Assay Procedure: 4. Add 100 µL of diluted samples, standards,
and controls to appropriate wells in the microplate. 5. Seal the plate
and incubate for 1 hour at room temperature. 6. Wash the microplate
3 times with washing buffer using a microplate washer. 7. Add 100 µL
of enzyme conjugate to each well. Seal the plate and incubate for 30
minutes. 8. Wash the microplate 3 times with washing buffer. 9. Add
100 µL of TMB substrate solution to each well and incubate in the
dark at room temperature for 15 minutes. 10. Add 50 µL of stop
solution to each well to stop the reaction.
D. Reading and Calculation: 11. Read absorbance at 450 nm using
an ELISA reader within 10 minutes of stopping the reaction. 12.
Calculate the concentrations from the standard curve generated
using the absorbance values.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run positive and negative controls with each assay to ensure
assay validity.
• Each new batch of ELISA kits should be validated with known
positive and negative samples.
• Verify instrument calibration regularly as per maintenance
schedule.
• Record the lot numbers and expiration dates of all reagents used.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Evaluate results using site-specific guidelines documented in the
laboratory information system (LIS).
• Results are to be reviewed and verified by the technologist prior
to reporting.
• Reference intervals for Cinnamon IgG should be defined based
on validated literature and laboratory norms.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to the ELISA kit manufacturer’s insert for reagent-specific
limitations and potential interferences.
• High levels of hemoglobin, bilirubin, or lipids in the sample may
affect assay accuracy.
