Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Generating Results for
Circulating Immune Complexes (CIC)
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to provide a standardized method for
generating results for Circulating Immune Complexes (CIC) in serum
samples, ensuring accuracy and reliability. This procedure covers
steps from sample preparation to result reporting.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing the
analysis as defined in this procedure. All staff members must ensure
accuracy of the measurements and follow procedural protocols for
documenting and reporting results.
1. DEFINITION
CICs are primarily immune complexes formed from antigens and
antibodies circulating in the bloodstream, indicative of various
autoimmune disorders and infections.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
• Specimen Type:
◦ Preferred: Serum
◦ Acceptable: Plasma (EDTA, heparin, or citrate)
• Specimen Collection and Handling:
◦ Collect blood in appropriate collection tubes.
◦ Separate serum/plasma from cells promptly by centrifugation.
◦ Specimens must be analyzed within 48 hours if stored at
2-8°C. If stored in a frozen state (below -20°C), specimens can
be analyzed within 1 month.
◦ Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
◦ Prior to analysis, ensure specimens are brought to room
temperature.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Equipment:
◦ Refrigerated centrifuge
◦ Standard laboratory pipettes
◦ Automated or manual immunoassay analyzer specific for CIC
detection
• Reagents:
◦ CIC detection reagents (as specified by manufacturer)
◦ Calibrators for CIC
• Supplies:
◦ Collection tubes (serum, EDTA, heparin, citrate)
◦ Pipette tips
◦ Reaction trays
◦ Appropriate quality control materials
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• CIC Levels:
◦ Normal: <20 μg/mL
◦ Elevated CIC levels: >20 μg/mL (indicative of autoimmune or
infection-related conditions)
1. QUALITY CONTROL
Internal Quality Control:
• Analyze two levels of control samples (negative and positive) with
each batch of patient samples.
• Controls should show values within established acceptable limits.
• Document all QC results in the QC log.
External Quality Assurance:
• Participate in proficiency testing programs as available.
• Perform quarterly comparisons with external laboratories.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation:
1. Label relevant tubes and reaction trays appropriately.
2. Pipette serum/plasma samples into designated reaction trays.
3. Allow reagents and specimens to come to room temperature.
B. Assay Procedure Manual (if automated process is
unavailable):
1. Add capture reagent to wells in microtiter plates as per
manufacturer's instructions.
2. Incubate plates for the specified time at recommended
temperature.
3. Wash plates using wash buffer to remove unbound materials.
4. Add detection reagent and incubate again.
5. Perform final wash and add substrate for color development.
6. Read absorbance using a plate reader.
C. Data Acquisition and Interpretation:
1. Transfer raw data to the laboratory information system (LIS).
2. Calculate CIC concentrations using standard curve generated
from calibrators.
3. Cross-check results for each sample control data.
4. REPORTING RESULTS
• Enter results promptly into the LIS.
• Results must be reviewed and verified by designated
technologists.
• All critical results must be communicated to the appropriate
clinician as per laboratory policy.
If there are discrepancies or sample integrity issues, consult a
supervisor immediately.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples may affect the results.
• Repeated freeze-thaw cycles can degrade CIC.
Refer to assay manufacturer instructions for specific limitations and
troubleshooting guidelines.
