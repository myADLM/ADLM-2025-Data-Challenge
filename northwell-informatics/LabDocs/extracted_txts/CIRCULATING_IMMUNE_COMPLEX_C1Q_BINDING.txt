Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Circulating Immune Complex,
C1q Binding Assay
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the procedure for the analytical phase of the
Circulating Immune Complex (CIC), C1q Binding Assay to ensure the
generation of accurate and reliable results. This procedure includes
the preparation, handling, and analysis of specimens, as well as the
documentation and reporting of results.
1. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel involved in the
analytical phase of the Circulating Immune Complex, C1q Binding
Assay.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all laboratory personnel to perform this
procedure as described and to ensure the highest standards of
accuracy and reliability in the analysis of CIC, C1q Binding Assays.
Any deviations from this procedure must be documented and
reported to the supervisor.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/acceptable:
• Serum separated from a blood sample collected in a plain red-top
tube.
• Specimen should be separated and stored at -20°C or lower until
analysis.
• Avoid multiple freeze-thaw cycles.
Unacceptable:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric specimens.
• Specimens stored at room temperature for prolonged periods.
• Specimens with incomplete identification or labeling.
1. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• C1q Binding Assay Kit (containing C1q-coated microtiter plates,
diluents, wash buffers, enzyme conjugates, substrates, and stop
solutions)
• Calibrators and Control Sera
• Micropipettes and tips
• Microplate washer
• Microplate reader capable of reading at 450 nm ‐ Distilled or
deionized water
• Timer
• Laboratory notebooks and log sheets
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run positive and negative controls with each assay to ensure the
validity of the results.
• Ensure all reagents and kits are stored and prepared according to
the manufacturer's instructions.
• Record all lot numbers and expiration dates in the laboratory
logbook.
• Perform calibration and maintenance of all equipment as per the
manufacturer's guidelines.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation:
1. Allow all reagents and specimens to reach room temperature
before starting the assay.
2. Prepare 1X wash buffer from the 10X concentrate provided in
the kit as per the manufacturer's instructions.
3. Dilute serum samples, calibrators, and controls in appropriate
diluent as specified in the assay kit instructions.
B. Assay Procedure:
1. Add the diluted serum samples, calibrators, and controls to the
C1q-coated microtiter plate wells as specified in the kit
instructions.
2. Incubate the plate at room temperature for the period indicated
by the manufacturer, typically 1-2 hours.
3. Wash the plate using the microplate washer at least 3 times
with the prepared wash buffer.
4. Add the enzyme conjugate to each well and incubate at room
temperature for the period specified in the kit instructions.
5. Wash the plate again as described in step 3.
6. Add the substrate solution to each well and incubate in the dark
for the time specified by the manufacturer until color
development.
7. Stop the reaction by adding the stop solution as indicated by
the kit instructions.
8. Read the optical density (OD) of each well at 450 nm using the
microplate reader within 30 minutes of stopping the reaction.
C. Calculation and Interpretation of Results:
1. Construct a standard curve using the OD values of the
calibrators.
2. Determine the concentration of CIC, C1q Binding in the serum
samples by comparing the OD values to the standard curve.
3. Ensure the values obtained for controls fall within the
established quality control range.
4. REPORTING RESULTS
• Record all results in the laboratory information system (LIS).
• Report results to the referring physician as per laboratory policy.
• Include a comment if the sample had any issues, e.g., hemolysis.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions for use of the C1q Binding Assay Kit.
• Laboratory internal quality control guidelines.
• Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines.
1. DOCUMENTATION
All raw data, including OD readings, calculations, and quality control
results, should be documented in the laboratory logbook or electronic
record-keeping system for traceability and review.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If control results fall outside the acceptable range, re-run the
controls before testing patient samples.
• If specimen results are inconsistent, verify specimen integrity and
repeat the assay if necessary.
• Consult the supervisor for any unresolved issues or if repeated
errors occur.
By following this SOP, laboratory personnel can ensure consistent,
high-quality results in the measurement of Circulating Immune
Complexes, C1q Binding.
