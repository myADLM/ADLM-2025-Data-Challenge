Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Circulating Immune
Complex and C3 Fragments Analysis
1. PURPOSE
To provide guidelines for the accurate and efficient analysis of
circulating immune complexes (CIC) and C3 fragments in serum
samples using standard laboratory procedures.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing and
documenting the analysis as per this SOP. It is also their duty to
identify any issues that could affect test results and report them to the
supervisor.
2. DEFINITION
Circulating Immune Complexes (CIC) refer to immunoglobulin-
antigen complexes found in the bloodstream. C3 fragments are
components of the complement system, involved in immune complex
activation.
3. SPECIMEN
Preferred/acceptable:
• Serum samples collected in SST (Serum Separator Tube) and
allowed to clot before centrifugation.
• Samples should be stored at -20°C if not immediately analyzed
and can be stable for up to 7 days.
Unacceptable:
• Specimens older than 7 days without proper storage conditions.
• Specimens that are hemolyzed or contaminated.
• Specimens collected in inappropriate containers or without proper
labeling.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• ELISA kits specific for CIC and C3 fragments analysis.
• Microtiter plates.
• Pipettes and tips.
• Centrifuge.
• Plate reader calibrated for specific wavelengths outlined in the kit
insert.
• Refrigerator and freezer (-20°C).
• Buffer solutions and wash solutions as specified by the ELISA kit
manufacturer.
• Incubator (37°C).
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE).
5. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Ensure all equipment is calibrated and functioning properly.
2. Verify that all reagents and supplies are within their expiration
dates.
3. Thaw serum samples to room temperature before analysis.
Assay Procedure:
1. Label the microtiter plates appropriately.
2. Add the pre-diluted standards, controls, and samples into the
wells as specified in the ELISA kit protocol.
3. Follow the incubation steps at specified times and
temperatures.
4. Wash the wells as directed to remove unbound substances.
5. Add the detection reagents (substrates/enzyme conjugates) as
outlined in the protocol.
6. Incubate the plates for the specified duration to allow for color
development.
7. Read the plates using the calibrated plate reader at the
wavelength specified in the kit instructions.
8. Record the optical density (OD) readings.
Quality Control:
1. Utilize both positive and negative controls in each assay run.
2. Maintain detailed logs of quality control results for trend
analysis.
6. RESULTS INTERPRETATION
1. Calculate the sample results based on the standard curve
generated from the known standards.
2. Compare the results against the reference range provided by
the kit or the laboratory’s established range.
Corrective Actions:
1. Assess any anomalies such as unexpected outliers or control
failures.
2. Perform troubleshooting steps such as verifying reagent
integrity, recalibrating equipment, or re-running the assay if
necessary.
3. Document any corrective steps taken in the laboratory log.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Transmit results electronically to the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
2. Review and verify results prior to final reporting.
3. Notify the relevant clinician if results indicate critical values
outside the established reference range.

complement components.
9. DOCUMENTATION
Ensure all aspects of the assay, including sample receipt, storage,
testing, and result entry, are documented. Maintain records of all
corrective actions taken during the testing process.
10. TRAINING
All designated laboratory staff must undergo training for performing
CIC and C3 fragments analysis as outlined in this SOP.
