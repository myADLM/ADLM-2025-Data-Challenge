Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for CIRCULATING IMMUNE
COMPLEX PANEL
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedures for the analysis
and result generation for the Circulating Immune Complex (CIC)
Panel in the laboratory. This ensures accurate and consistent results
to support the diagnosis and monitoring of immune complex-
mediated diseases.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing and
documenting all analytical procedures as defined in this SOP. It is
also their responsibility to identify any issues during testing that may
affect the results and report these to the supervisor.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
• Type: Serum
• Volume: Minimum 1 mL
• Collection: Blood should be collected in a red-top tube (no gel
separator). Allow blood to clot at room temperature for 30-60
minutes and then centrifuge to separate serum.
• Storage and Stability: Serum should be stored at 2-8°C for up to
72 hours or frozen at -20°C or below for longer storage.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Grossly hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric specimens.
• Specimens collected in tubes with gel separators.
• Specimens with insufficient volume.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Equipment:
◦ Centrifuge
◦ Micropipettes
◦ Refrigerators and freezers (temperature monitored)
◦ Analytical balance
◦ ELISA reader and washer
◦ Incubator
• Reagents:
◦ Commercial ELISA kits for various components (C1q, C3d,
etc.)
◦ Controls (positive and negative)
◦ Calibrators
◦ TBS (Tris-buffered saline), wash buffer, and substrate solution.
• Supplies:
◦ Microtiter plates for ELISA
◦ Disposable pipette tips
◦ Calibrated micropipettes
◦ Absorbent pads
◦ Gloves and lab coat
1. PROCEDURAL STEPS
A) Preparation for Test:
1. Thaw frozen serum samples and controls at room temperature.
Mix gently and ensure there are no clots or particulate matter.
2. Set up the ELISA workstation, ensuring that the ELISA reader
and washer are calibrated and functional.
3. Bring all reagents, controls, and calibrators to room
temperature before use.
B) ELISA Procedure:
1. Plate Setup:
◦ Prepare the microtiter plate as per the assay protocol.
◦ Dispense the required volume of standards, controls, and
serum samples into designated wells.
2. Incubation:
◦ Add the diluted serum samples and controls to the pre-
coated microtiter wells.
◦ Incubate the plate as per the manufacturer's protocol,
usually at 37°C for a specified time.
3. Washing:
◦ Wash the plate using the ELISA washer according to the
protocol. Ensure no residual liquid remains in the wells.
4. Substrate Addition:
◦ Add the substrate solution to the wells and incubate in the
dark at room temperature.
5. Stop Reaction:
◦ Stop the enzymatic reaction by adding the stop solution as
per the protocol specifications.
C) Reading Results:
1. Measurement:
◦ Read the absorbance at the specified wavelength using the
ELISA reader.
◦ Ensure that the ELISA reader has been calibrated for
accurate measurements.
2. Documentation:
◦ Document the absorbance values and ensure the results
are within the linear range of the standard curve.
◦ Use the software or manual calculations to determine the
concentration of immune complexes in the samples.
D) Quality Control:
1. QC Samples:
◦ Run positive and negative controls with each batch of
samples.
◦ Ensure that control results are within the established ranges
before validating patient results.
2. Inter-Laboratory Comparison:
◦ Participate in inter-laboratory proficiency testing to ensure
consistency and accuracy of results.
Corrective Actions:
• If controls are out of range, re-run the assay.
• Verify all reagents and equipment for potential issues before
running the assay again.
• Document all corrective actions taken.
1. RESULT REPORTING
• Report the results using the laboratory information system (LIS).
• Ensure that results are reviewed and signed off by a qualified
technologist or supervisor before releasing.
• Critical values should be communicated to the requesting clinician
immediately according to the laboratory’s critical result policy.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Normal reference ranges should be established and validated by the
laboratory and provided in the test report.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Performance of the assay may be affected by hemolysis, lipemia,
and icterus.
• The presence of heterophile antibodies in the patient serum can
lead to false results.
• Technical errors in the assay setup, incubation, and washing
steps can affect the results.
