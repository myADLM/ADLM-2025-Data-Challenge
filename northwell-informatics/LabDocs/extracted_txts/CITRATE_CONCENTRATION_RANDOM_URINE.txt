Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for
Analytical Phase: Citrate Concentration,
Random, Urine
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for the accurate and consistent
measurement of citrate concentration in random urine samples.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel responsible for
analyzing citrate concentration in random urine samples using
validated methodologies and instruments available in the laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Laboratory technologists must follow this SOP for the analysis of
citrate concentration in urine samples.
• The supervisor is responsible for ensuring compliance with the
SOP and addressing any issues that arise during the analytical
phase.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Centrifuge
• pH meter or pH strips
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Analytical balance
• Spectrophotometer or Ion Chromatography system
Reagents:
• Standard citrate solutions
• Distilled or deionized water
• Reagent specific to the detection method (e.g., citrate assays kit if
using spectrophotometry)
• Calibrators and controls suitable for the chosen analytical method
Supplies:
• Urine collection containers
• Test tubes or sample containers
• Gloves and lab coat for personal safety
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Preferred/acceptable:
• 10 mL of freshly voided random urine specimen.
• Urine specimens should be collected in a clean container and
stored at 2-8°C if not analyzed immediately.
Unacceptable:
• Specimens greater than 24 hours old if not refrigerated.
• Specimens without proper labelling (patient identification,
collection date/time).
6. PROCEDURE
Pre-analytical Preparation
1. Sample Handling:
◦ Upon receipt, verify that each urine sample is correctly
labeled and check for any signs of contamination or
improper storage.
◦ If the sample has been refrigerated, allow it to reach room
temperature before analysis.
2. Sample Preparation:
◦ Mix the urine sample thoroughly.
◦ Centrifuge the sample at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes to remove
any debris or particulate matter.
◦ Measure and record the pH of the sample to ensure it is
within the acceptable range (pH 4.5–8.0).
Analytical Procedure
1. Calibration and Quality Control:
◦ Calibrate the spectrophotometer or ion chromatography
system according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Run quality control samples (low, medium, and high citrate
concentrations) to ensure the system is performing within
acceptable limits.
2. Sample Analysis:
◦ Pipette 1 mL of the prepared urine sample into a reaction
vessel or sample vial.
◦ If using a spectrophotometric method:
▪ Add the appropriate volume of reagent specific to the
citrate assay kit.
▪ Incubate the mixture according to the kit instructions
(usually at room temperature for a specified duration).
▪ Measure the absorbance at the specified wavelength
(e.g., 340 nm) using a spectrophotometer.
◦ If using ion chromatography:
▪ Inject a specified volume of the sample into the
chromatography system.
▪ Run the sample according to the ion chromatography
method parameters.
▪ Identify the citrate peak and quantify the concentration
based on calibration curves.
3. Data Recording and Interpretation:
◦ Record the citrate concentration results for each sample.
◦ Compare the results with quality control data to ensure
accuracy before reporting.
Post-analytical Process
1. Review and Verification:
◦ Technologists should review the results for accuracy and
completeness.
◦ Supervisor or designated personnel must verify and validate
the results before release.
2. Reporting Results:
◦ Enter the validated results into the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
◦ Provide any necessary interpretative comments if required
by the specific laboratory guidelines.
3. Sample Storage and Disposal:
◦ Store any remaining sample at 2-8°C for potential
reanalysis.
◦ Dispose of samples and reagents according to laboratory
safety protocols and regulations.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run quality control samples at the beginning of each analytical
batch.
• Document all quality control results and take corrective actions if
results fall outside acceptable ranges.
• Perform regular maintenance and calibration of all equipment
used in the procedure.
8. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instruction manual for the spectrophotometer or
ion chromatography system.
• Citrate assay kit package insert or reagent preparation guide.
• Laboratory’s quality control and calibration SOPs.
