Standard Operating Procedure for Analytical Phase: Citrate/
Creatinine Ratio, Urine
1. PURPOSE
To provide accurate measurement and calculation of the Citrate/
Creatinine ratio in urine samples.
Responsibility: Qualified laboratory staff are responsible for
performing the analysis, recording results, and ensuring that the
quality control measures are adhered to. Supervisors are responsible
for monitoring compliance with the procedure and addressing any
discrepancies or deviations.
1. DEFINITION
The Citrate/Creatinine ratio is a diagnostic marker used to assess
kidney function and monitor conditions like metabolic disorders,
kidney stones, and other kidney-related diseases.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Preferred/acceptable specimens:
• 10-20mL freshly voided urine collected into a sterile container
without preservatives. Must be processed within 2 hours of
collection for optimal results.
• BD Vacutainer Urinalysis Preservative Conical Urine tube.
Specimens in these tubes are stable for up to 72 hours at 4-25°C
with an ideal volume of 7-9mL.
Unacceptable specimens:
• Specimens arriving in the laboratory greater than 2 hours after
collection without preservative.
• Specimens with no collection date/time indicated on the sample
container or requisition.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• Calibrated centrifuge
• Calibrated spectrophotometer or colorimetric analyzer
• Citrate Assay Kit
• Creatinine Assay Kit
• Micropipettes and pipette tips
• Reagent grade water
1. PROCEDURE
A) INITIAL PREPARATION
• Verify specimen integrity and ensure proper labeling.
• If using refrigerated samples, bring to room temperature
(20-25°C) before proceeding.
B) CITRATE MEASUREMENT
• Prepare the Citrate Assay Kit according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
• Aliquot the sample urine (typically 1-2mL) into a clean labeled
tube.
• Add appropriate reagent based on the assay kit instructions.
• Incubate the reaction mixture as specified by the kit protocol.
• Measure absorbance using the spectrophotometer at the
wavelength specified in the assay kit insert (typically 570 nm).
• Record the concentration of citrate (in mmol/L).
C) CREATININE MEASUREMENT
• Prepare the Creatinine Assay Kit following the manufacturer's
instructions.
• Aliquot the sample urine (typically 1-2mL) into another clean
labeled tube.
• Add appropriate reagent per the assay kit instructions.
• Incubate the reaction mixture as directed in the assay kit protocol.
• Measure absorbance using the spectrophotometer at the
wavelength specified in the assay kit insert (typically 492 nm).
• Record the concentration of creatinine (in mg/dL).
D) CALCULATION OF CITRATE/CREATININE RATIO
• Convert creatinine concentration from mg/dL to mmol/L:
[Creatinine (mg/dL)] × 0.0884 = [Creatinine (mmol/L)]
• Calculate the ratio: Citrate/Creatinine Ratio = [Citrate (mmol/L)] /
[Creatinine (mmol/L)]
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run both citrate and creatinine controls with each batch of patient
samples (standards provided by the assay kits).
• Record control results and ensure they fall within the acceptable
range provided by the assay kit.
• If controls fall outside the acceptable range, troubleshoot per site-
specific guidelines and repeat the assay.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Document results of citrate and creatinine measurements as well
as the calculated ratio in the LIS (Laboratory Information System).
• Review and verify results before releasing them to ensure they
meet quality control criteria.
• Results should be recorded in mmol/L for both citrate and
creatinine, with their ratio presented as a dimensionless number.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Citrate: 0.2-4 mmol/L
• Creatinine: 0.5-1.5 mmol/L (converted from mg/dL)
• Citrate/Creatinine Ratio: 0.5-3 (dimensionless)
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Limitations are detailed in the assay kits' product inserts for citrate
and creatinine. Insufficient or improperly stored specimens can lead
to inaccurate results. Interferences from substances within the urine
may also affect the results.
