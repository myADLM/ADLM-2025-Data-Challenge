Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Citrate Excretion, 24 Hour,
Urine
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the analytical procedure for the
determination of citrate excretion in a 24-hour urine sample. This
protocol ensures consistency, accuracy, and reliability in the
measurement and reporting of citrate levels.
1. SCOPE
This SOP is applicable to all technical staff performing citrate
excretion analysis in the clinical laboratory.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing
citrate excretion analysis according to this SOP. It is the responsibility
of the laboratory supervisor to ensure all staff are adequately trained
and to validate all equipment and methodologies used in this
analysis.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type: 24-hour urine collection Specimen Volume: Minimum
25 mL Storage Conditions: Refrigerate during collection; after
collection, store at 2-8°C.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• Calibrated balance
• pH meter
• Centrifuge
• Urinalysis containers
• Citrate reagent kit (as per manufacturer’s instructions)
• Standard reference solutions
• Disposable pipettes
• Protective gear (gloves, lab coat, safety goggles)
1. PROCEDURE
Pre-analytical Phase:
1. Verify that the 24-hour urine collection is complete and that the
total volume is recorded.
2. Mix the urine sample thoroughly.
3. Measure the pH of the urine sample. Adjust to pH 2-3 using
hydrochloric acid, if necessary.
4. Centrifuge the sample at 3000 RPM for 10 minutes to remove
any particulates.
Analytical Phase:
1. Preparation of Reagents and Calibration:
◦ Prepare citrate calibration standards according to the
manufacturer’s protocol.
◦ Set up the analyzer according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
◦ Ensure the proper calibration of the equipment using the
citrate standards.
2. Sample Analysis:
◦ Pipette a defined volume (e.g., 2 mL) of the urine sample
into the reaction vessel.
◦ Add appropriate reagents as specified in the reagent kit
instructions.
◦ Incubate the mixture at the specified temperature and time.
◦ Measure the absorbance or endpoint using the designated
analyzer.
3. Calculating Citrate Concentration:
◦ Generate a standard curve using the prepared citrate
standards.
◦ Calculate the concentration of citrate in the urine sample by
comparing the sample absorbance to the standard curve.
◦ Report the concentration in mmol/24 hours as follows:
Citrate concentration (mmol) = Measured concentration
(mmol/L) × Total volume of urine (L).
Post-analytical Phase:
1. Review the results for each sample.
2. Verify and document any results that fall outside the expected
reference ranges.
3. Enter the verified results into the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
4. Dispose of any biohazard waste according to laboratory
protocols.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run quality control samples alongside patient samples to ensure
assay accuracy.
• At least two levels of quality control samples (normal and
abnormal) should be tested with each batch of patient samples.
• Document all quality control results and take corrective actions if
results are outside of acceptable ranges.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Refer to site-specific reporting guidelines for documentation and
communication of results.
• Critical values should be communicated to the appropriate
healthcare provider immediately and documented accordingly.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Normal acceptable ranges for urine citrate excretion:
• Adult: 320 - 1240 mg/24 hours (1.67 - 6.47 mmol/24 hours) Note:
Reference intervals should be validated for the specific population
served by the laboratory.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Variations in collection timing or incomplete collection can affect
test results.
• Proper sample handling and storage are crucial to avoid
degradation of citrate.

1. DOCUMENTATION
Ensure all steps taken during sample processing, analysis, and result
verification are documented clearly and accurately in the laboratory
records.
