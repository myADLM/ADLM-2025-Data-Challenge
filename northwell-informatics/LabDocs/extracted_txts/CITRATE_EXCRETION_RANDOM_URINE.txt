Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Citrate Excretion, Random,
Urine
1. Purpose To provide a standardized procedure for the
measurement of citrate excretion in random urine specimens,
ensuring accurate and reliable results.
2. Scope This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel
involved in the analysis of citrate excretion in random urine
samples.
3. Responsibility It is the responsibility of designated laboratory
personnel to perform this procedure as outlined and ensure that
all quality control measures are followed.
4. Specimen Requirements and Stability
◦ Preferred/acceptable specimen: -- 10 mL of random urine
collected in a sterile container. -- The specimen should be
collected and delivered to the laboratory within 2 hours at
room temperature or within 24 hours if refrigerated (2-8°C).
◦ Unacceptable specimens: -- Specimens collected more than
2 hours before delivery without refrigeration. -- Specimens
without proper labeling (e.g., missing patient identification
details or collection date/time).
5. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies
◦ Urine collection containers
◦ Centrifuge
◦ Citrate reagent kit (manufacturer-specified)
◦ Calibrated pipettes and tips
◦ Calibrated spectrophotometer
◦ Quality control materials (low, normal, high levels)
◦ Personal protective equipment (PPE)
6. Quality Control
◦ Perform quality control tests using low, normal, and high-
level control materials at the start of each testing day and
after every 20 specimens.
◦ Record control results in the Quality Control Log.
◦ If control results are out of the acceptable range, do not
proceed with specimen testing. Investigate and resolve
before proceeding.
7. Procedure A. Sample Preparation:
◦ Ensure samples are at room temperature before testing.
◦ Mix the urine sample thoroughly by gentle inversion.
B. Aliquoting:
• Aliquot a sufficient volume of urine (according to the reagent kit
instructions) into a labeled test tube.
• Centrifuge the aliquot at 3000 RPM for 10 minutes to remove any
particulate matter.
C. Analysis:
• Prepare the citrate reagent according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
• Pipette the appropriate volume of reagent and urine supernatant
into a new test tube as specified by the reagent kit protocol.
• Incubate the mixed solution for the time specified by the reagent
kit protocol to allow the reaction to occur.
• Measure the absorbance of the reaction solution using a
spectrophotometer set to the wavelength specified by the reagent
kit.
• Record the absorbance values.
D. Calculation of Results:
• Use the standard curve provided by the reagent manufacturer to
calculate the citrate concentration in the urine sample.
• Report results in mmol/L based on the calculated concentration.
1. Reporting Results
◦ Verify and document all results in the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
◦ Critical results, if observed, should be immediately
communicated to the supervising technologist and the
requesting physician.
2. Reference Intervals
◦ The normal citrate excretion range for random urine
samples is typically 1.6–3.8 mmol/L but may vary according
to patient demographics and clinical conditions. Refer to the
site-specific reference intervals.
3. Method Limitations
• Interference may occur from substances in urine that alter pH
significantly.
• Specimen contamination can lead to erroneous results.
• Ensure samples are free from particulates as they can interfere
with spectrophotometric readings.

This SOP must be reviewed annually and updated as required. All
laboratory personnel must be trained on this procedure before being
allowed to perform the test independently.
