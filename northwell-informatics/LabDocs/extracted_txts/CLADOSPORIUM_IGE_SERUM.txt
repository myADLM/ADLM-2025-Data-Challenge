Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Cladosporium-specific Immunoglobulin
E (IgE) in Serum
1. PURPOSE
To outline the steps required for the analysis and reporting of
Cladosporium-specific Immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels in serum using
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) methodology or an
equivalent immunoassay technique.
1. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel performing
Cladosporium-specific IgE testing in serum samples in a CLIA-
certified laboratory.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
• Laboratory Technologists: Perform the testing and initial data
analysis.
• Supervisors: Review and validate test results.
• Quality Control Personnel: Ensure all quality controls and
calibration checks are performed as per protocol.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Serum
• Preferred/Acceptable: 0.5 mL serum collected in a gold-top (SST)
or red-top tube.
• Unacceptable: Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples or samples
not properly labeled or with insufficient volume.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• ELISA kit specific for Cladosporium IgE or equivalent
immunoassay
• Microplate reader (capable of reading at appropriate wavelengths
for the assay)
• Calibrated pipettes and tips
• Incubator (capable of maintaining 37°C)
• Washing equipment (manual or automated)
• Quality control material (positive and negative controls)
• Reagents: Coated microplates, conjugate, substrate, stop
solution, and any additional reagents specified by the
manufacturer.
1. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation
1. Verify that the sample is properly centrifuged, and serum is
separated and stored at appropriate conditions as per
laboratory protocol.
2. Bring samples, controls, and reagents to room temperature
before use.
3. Ensure that all equipment is calibrated and in working order.
B) Assay Procedure
1. Sample Application:
◦ Pipette the required volume of controls, calibrators, and
patient samples into designated wells on the microplate.
◦ Duplicate measurements are recommended for accuracy.
2. Incubation:
◦ Incubate the plate as per the specified time and temperature
in the kit insert. Typically, this involves incubation at 37°C for
a specified duration.
3. Washing:
◦ Wash the microplate wells according to the kit instructions to
remove unbound material. Ensure complete removal of
wash buffer to avoid assay interference.
4. Addition of Conjugate:
◦ Add enzyme-labeled anti-IgE conjugate to each well and
incubate as per the kit instructions.
5. Substrate Addition:
◦ Add the substrate solution to each well. Incubate the plate in
the dark at room temperature, avoiding light exposure.
6. Stopping Reaction:
◦ Add the stop solution to each well to halt the enzymatic
reaction. The color change is indicative of the presence of
Cladosporium-specific IgE.
7. Reading the Results:
◦ Read the absorbance of each well at the specific
wavelength (typically 450 nm) using a microplate reader
within 30 minutes of adding the stop solution.
C) Calculation and Interpretation
1. Create a standard curve using the absorbance values from the
calibrators.
2. Calculate the concentration of Cladosporium-specific IgE in
each patient sample using the standard curve.
3. Validate and review results according to laboratory and
manufacturer’s guidelines.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run positive and negative controls with each assay to ensure
accuracy and reliability.
• Document all quality control data and verify that controls fall within
established ranges.
• Perform troubleshooting and corrective actions if controls fall
outside of acceptable ranges before reporting patient results.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results should be documented and reviewed by a qualified
supervisor.
• Report serum Cladosporium-specific IgE levels in KU/L (kilounits
per liter) or appropriate units as specified by the assay kit.
• Critical values and significant findings should be promptly
communicated to the physician or relevant healthcare provider.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Refer to the manufacturer’s guidelines or established laboratory
reference intervals for interpreting IgE levels.
• Normal reference ranges for Cladosporium-specific IgE should be
clearly defined based on population studies or manufacturer’s
insert.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples may interfere with test
results.
• Cross-reactivity with other fungal IgEs must be considered when
interpreting results.
• Refer to the assay kit insert for specific method limitations.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s assay kit insert and instructions.
• Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines.
• Relevant literature and internal validation studies.
This protocol ensures accuracy, reproducibility, and reliability when
testing for Cladosporium-specific IgE in serum. All laboratory
personnel must be familiar with this SOP and adhere to it strictly to
maintain high standards of quality and compliance in the laboratory.
