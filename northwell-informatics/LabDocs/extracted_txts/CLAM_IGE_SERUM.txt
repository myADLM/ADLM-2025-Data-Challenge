SOP: Analytical Process for Quantification of Clam (Clostridium
Lecithinase Activity Measurement), Immunoglobulin E (IgE), and
Serum Analysis
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for the accurate and precise analysis of
Clam, Immunoglobulin E (IgE), and various serum analytes. This
protocol ensures the reliability and reproducibility of test results in
compliance with CLIA regulations.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory staff are responsible for
conducting analyses as defined in this procedure. Laboratory
supervisors are responsible for monitoring compliance with the
procedural guidelines and ensuring corrective actions are taken when
necessary.
1. SPECIMEN
Specimen Type:
• Clam: Serum or plasma (EDTA)
• IgE: Serum
• General Serum Analysis: Serum
Specimen Requirements:
• Blood samples should be collected following standard phlebotomy
procedures.
• Serum should be separated from cells as soon as possible,
ideally within 1 hour of collection.
• Avoid hemolysis, lipemia, or icteric conditions as they can affect
test results.
Specimen Stability and Storage:
• Serum and plasma samples are stable at room temperature for up
to 8 hours, 2-8°C for up to 72 hours, and at -20°C or lower for
long-term storage.
• Avoid repeated freeze/thaw cycles.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Ensure all supplies and reagents are within their expiration dates and
stored according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Equipment
should be regularly maintained and calibrated.
• Automated Immunoassay Analyzer
• Elisa Plate Reader
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes and Tips
• Calibrators and Controls specific for Clam, IgE, and serum
analytes
• Reagents specific for Clam assay, IgE measurement, and Serum
Analytes
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
1. PROCEDURE
4.1 CLAM (Clostridium Lecithinase Activity Measurement):
4.1.1 Preparation:
• Thaw serum/plasma samples at room temperature, mix well by
gentle inversion.
• Prepare all reagents and calibration standards as per the
manufacturer’s guidelines.
4.1.2 Analysis:
• Load the samples and calibrators onto the Elisa Plate Reader as
per the manufacturer’s instructions.
• Measure the activity of the Clostridium Lecithinase enzyme
spectrophotometrically at the designated wavelength.
• Follow the kit protocol for incubation times, reagent additions, and
wash steps.
4.1.3 Data Interpretation:
• Calculate the enzyme activity based on the standard curve
generated from calibration standards.
• Record the results in the laboratory information system (LIS).
4.2 Immunoglobulin E (IgE):
4.2.1 Preparation:
• Thaw serum samples at room temperature, mix well by gentle
inversion.
• Ensure that all reagents, calibrators, and controls are brought to
room temperature before use.
4.2.2 Analysis:
• Load the samples, calibrators, and controls onto the automated
immunoassay analyzer.
• Select the IgE assay protocol and run the samples as per the
manufacturer's instructions.
• The analyzer will automatically process, measure, and generate
results.
4.2.3 Data Interpretation:
• Review and verify the results generated by the analyzer.
• Record and validate the results in the LIS.
4.3 General Serum Analysis:
4.3.1 Preparation:
• Thaw serum samples at room temperature, mix well by gentle
inversion.
• Prepare reagents and calibration standards according to the
assay-specific requirements.
4.3.2 Analysis:
• Depending on analytes being tested, set up the appropriate
assays using either automated analyzers or manual methods.
• Follow specific assay procedures for incubation times, reagent
additions, and detection methods.
4.3.3 Data Interpretation:
• For automated systems, results will be directly obtained from the
analyzer; manual methods require visual or spectrophotometric
readings.
• Compare results against standard curves or reference ranges.
• Enter results into the LIS and validate.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run quality controls (QC) at the beginning of each analytical run,
after maintenance, and with each new batch of reagents.
• Ensure that QC results fall within acceptable range before
reporting patient results. Re-run the assay if QC fails.
• Document all QC results and any corrective actions taken.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Review all results for accuracy and completeness before
releasing.
• Critical results are to be verified and immediately communicated
to the responsible healthcare provider as per laboratory policy.
• Enter validated results into the LIS, ensuring they are accurate
and promptly reported.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If an assay fails, review assay preparation, specimen quality,
reagent integrity, and instrument performance.
• Consult the manufacturer’s troubleshooting guide and take
corrective actions as necessary.
• Document any issues and corrective actions in the laboratory
logbook.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Provide assay-specific reference intervals based on validated data.
Review and update intervals periodically.
1. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS
• Follow all laboratory safety guidelines, including wearing
appropriate PPE.
• Handle and dispose of biohazard materials as per lab policy.
1. DOCUMENTATION
• Record all procedural steps, calibrations, maintenance activities,
QC results, and instrument logs accurately.
• Maintain documentation for regulatory compliance and audits.
1. REFERENCES
Include detailed references and manufacturer's instructions for all
assays used in the protocol.
