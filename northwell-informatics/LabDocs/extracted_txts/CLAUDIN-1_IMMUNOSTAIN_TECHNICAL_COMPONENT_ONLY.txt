STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP)
Title: CLAUDIN-1 IMMUNOSTAIN, TECHNICAL COMPONENT
ONLY
1. PURPOSE
To establish the procedure for the technical component of
CLAUDIN-1 immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining to ensure accurate
and reproducible results. This protocol outlines the steps for staining
tissue sections with CLAUDIN-1 antibody, including preparation,
staining, and quality control.
Responsibility:
Designated lab personnel trained in immunohistochemistry
techniques are responsible for performing and documenting the steps
outlined in this procedure. It is the responsibility of all staff to identify
and report any deficiencies or deviations from the protocol to the
supervisor.
1. DEFINITION
CLAUDIN-1 is a membrane protein involved in tight junctions and
cellular permeability control. Immunostaining methods are used to
detect CLAUDIN-1 expression in tissue samples for diagnostic and
research purposes.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation
1. Ensure tissue samples are fixed in 10% formalin for 24-48
hours.
2. Process fixed tissues and embed them in paraffin blocks.
3. Cut 4 μm sections from paraffin blocks using a microtome.
4. Mount sections onto glass slides and allow to dry overnight at
room temperature.
B. Deparaffinization and Rehydration
1. Place slides in a staining rack.
2. Deparaffinize sections by immersing slides in a series of xylene
baths:
◦ Xylene I: 5 minutes
◦ Xylene II: 5 minutes
◦ Xylene III: 5 minutes
3. Rehydrate sections by immersing slides through graded ethanol
baths:
◦ 100% ethanol: 5 minutes
◦ 95% ethanol: 5 minutes
◦ 70% ethanol: 5 minutes
◦ Distilled water: 5 minutes
C. Antigen Retrieval
1. Prepare antigen retrieval solution (sodium citrate buffer, pH 6.0
or 10 mM Tris-EDTA, pH 9.0).
2. Heat the retrieval solution to 95-100°C in a water bath or
pressure cooker.
3. Submerge slides in the retrieval solution and incubate at
95-100°C for 20-30 minutes.
4. Allow slides to cool for 20 minutes at room temperature.
5. Rinse slides in distilled water.
D. Blocking
1. Encircle the tissue sections with a hydrophobic pen to contain
reagents.
2. Incubate sections with 3% hydrogen peroxide for 10 minutes to
quench endogenous peroxidase.
3. Rinse slides with PBS (Phosphate-Buffered Saline), pH 7.4.
4. Block non-specific binding by incubating slides with 5% normal
serum from the host species of the secondary antibody for 30
minutes at room temperature.
E. Primary Antibody Incubation
1. Dilute the primary CLAUDIN-1 antibody according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Apply the diluted antibody to the sections, covering them
entirely.
3. Incubate slides in a humidified chamber at 4°C overnight.
F. Secondary Antibody and Detection
1. Rinse slides in PBS, pH 7.4, three times for 5 minutes each.
2. Apply the secondary antibody (biotinylated or enzyme-
conjugated) targeting the host species of the primary antibody
and incubate for 30 minutes at room temperature.
3. Rinse slides in PBS, pH 7.4, three times for 5 minutes each.
4. If using a biotinylated secondary antibody, apply avidin-biotin
complex (ABC) reagent according to the manufacturer’s
instructions and incubate for 30 minutes.
G. Chromogen Development
1. Prepare the chromogen solution (e.g., Diaminobenzidine -
DAB).
2. Apply chromogen to the sections and incubate until desired
stain intensity is reached (usually 5-10 minutes).
3. Monitor development under a microscope to avoid overstaining.
4. Rinse slides in distilled water.
H. Counterstaining and Mounting
1. Counterstain slides with hematoxylin for 30 seconds to 1
minute.
2. Rinse slides in running tap water to blue the hematoxylin stain.
3. Dehydrate slides through graded ethanol baths (70% - 95% -
100%) and clear in xylene.
4. Apply mounting medium and cover slips.
I. Quality Control
1. Include positive and negative controls in each staining batch.
2. Inspect stained slides under a microscope to ensure proper
staining and specificity.
3. Document any deviations or observations affecting the quality
of the staining.
4. REPORTING RESULTS
Technical personnel will document the process and ensure that the
stained slides are delivered to the pathologist for interpretation. The
pathologist will issue a diagnostic report based on the stained slides.
1. LIMITATIONS
Refer to the antibody datasheet and product insert for any specific
limitations associated with the CLAUDIN-1 antibody. Quality of
staining may be affected by improper tissue handling, fixation, and
sectioning.
