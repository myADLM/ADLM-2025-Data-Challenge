STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP)
CLAUDIN-4 IMMUNOSTAIN - TECHNICAL COMPONENT ONLY
1. PURPOSE
This procedure outlines the analytical phase of generating results for
Claudin-4 immunostain, technical component only. It describes the
necessary steps for preparing tissue, performing the immunostain,
and documenting the process to ensure accurate and reproducible
results.
2. SCOPE
This SOP is applicable to all processing of Claudin-4 immunostain in
the laboratory, including the use of appropriate reagents and
equipment, and methods for quality control and documentation.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the laboratory technician to follow all
procedures outlined in this document to ensure accurate and
consistent results. Supervisors are responsible for overseeing the
process and addressing any issues that may arise.
4. DEFINITIONS
• Claudin-4: A protein used as a biomarker in various diagnostic
contexts.
• Immunostain: A technique used to detect specific proteins in
tissue samples using the principle of immunohistochemistry (IHC).
• Technical component: The portion of the test related to the
preparation and analysis of the tissue, excluding interpretation.
5. MATERIALS, EQUIPMENT, AND REAGENTS
• Tissue samples (freshly collected, fixed, and embedded in
paraffin).
• Claudin-4 primary antibody.
• Secondary antibody conjugate.
• Detection system (e.g., DAB substrate or alternative chromogen).
• Positive and negative control slides.
• Automated immunostainer or manual staining equipment.
• Xylene and ethanol for deparaffinization and hydration.
• Coverslips and mounting medium.
• Appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE).
6. PROCEDURE
6.1 Tissue Preparation
1. Cutting the Sections:
◦ Cut 4-5 micron sections from paraffin-embedded tissue
blocks using a microtome.
◦ Place sections on positively charged slides.
2. Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
◦ Immerse slides in xylene for 5 minutes, repeat.
◦ Transfer slides through graded ethanol solutions (100%,
95%, 70%) for 5 minutes each.
◦ Rinse slides in distilled water.
6.2 Immunostaining
1. Antigen Retrieval:
◦ Perform heat-induced antigen retrieval by placing slides in a
prewarmed retrieval solution (e.g., citrate buffer at pH6 or
TRIS-EDTA buffer at pH9) and incubate in a microwave/
pressure cooker for 20 minutes.
◦ Allow slides to cool at room temperature for 20 minutes.
◦ Rinse slides with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).
2. Blocking:
◦ Incubate the slides with blocking solution (e.g., serum-free
protein block) for 10-20 minutes to reduce non-specific
binding.
3. Primary Antibody Incubation:
◦ Apply Claudin-4 primary antibody to the slides.
◦ Incubate overnight at 4°C or for 30-60 minutes at room
temperature, as per manufacturer’s instructions.
4. Secondary Antibody Incubation:
◦ Apply appropriate secondary antibody conjugate.
◦ Incubate for 30-60 minutes at room temperature.
5. Detection:
◦ Apply DAB substrate or appropriate chromogen and
incubate until desired color development is observed
(typically 5-10 minutes).
◦ Counterstain with hematoxylin if needed and rinse in tap
water.
6.3 Final Steps
1. Dehydration:
◦ Dehydrate slides through graded ethanol solutions (70%,
95%, 100%) and clear in xylene.
2. Mounting:
◦ Apply coverslips using mounting medium.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Positive and Negative Controls:
◦ Run positive control (known Claudin-4 expressing tissue)
and negative control (no primary antibody) slides with each
batch to ensure staining procedure worked correctly.
2. Documentation:
◦ Record the date, time, batch number, name of the
technician, and any relevant observations on the
immunostaining log.
8. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If staining is weak or non-specific, reassess the antibody, antigen
retrieval method, and blocking steps.
• If there is excessive background staining, ensure slides were
sufficiently blocked and washed.
• Consult supervisor if issues persist or refer to antibody
manufacturer's troubleshooting guide.
