STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP)
1. PURPOSE
This procedure outlines the process for generating results for
CLAUDIN 18 (CLDN18) through semi-quantitative
immunohistochemistry using a manual method. This protocol ensures
consistency and accuracy in detecting and semi-quantifying
CLAUDIN 18 in tissue specimens. Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of the technologist performing the assay to
adhere to this procedure, ensure the accuracy of results, and to
promptly notify the supervisor if any issues arise during the analytical
phase.
1. DEFINITION
CLAUDIN 18 (CLDN18) is a biomarker frequently associated with
various types of carcinoma. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) is employed
to visualize the distribution and localization of CLDN18 within tissue
sections.
1. PROCEDURE
SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS: 1. Preferred Specimen: Formalin-
fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue sections. 2. Slide
Preparation: Cut sections into 4-micron thick slices and mount on
positively charged glass slides.
EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES: 1. Primary Antibody:
Anti-CLAUDIN 18 (CLDN18) (43-14A) 2. Secondary Antibody: HRP
conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG as appropriate. 3. Detection
System: DAB substrate kit. 4. Control Slides: Positive and negative
tissue controls. 5. Microscope: Bright-field for evaluation of staining.
6. Tissue Processor: For dehydration, clearing, and embedding of
tissue.
PROCEDURE PROCESS:
Tissue Section Preparation: 1. Deparaffinize sections in xylene or
xylene substitutes for 10 minutes twice. 2. Rehydrate through graded
alcohol (100%, 95%, 70%) for 5 minutes each. 3. Wash sections in
distilled water for 5 minutes.
Antigen Retrieval: 1. Place slides in citrate buffer (pH 6.0) or EDTA
buffer (pH 9.0) as required by the antibody. 2. Heat sections in a
microwave or water bath at 95-99°C for 20-40 minutes. 3. Cool slides
to room temperature in the buffer and rinse with PBS or TBS.
Blocking: 1. Incubate slides with protein block (e.g., serum, BSA) for
10 minutes to reduce non-specific binding.
Primary Antibody Incubation: 1. Dilute Anti-CLAUDIN 18 antibody
according to manufacturer’s instructions. 2. Apply primary antibody to
sections and incubate in a humid chamber for 1 hour at room
temperature or overnight at 4°C.
Secondary Antibody Incubation: 1. After primary antibody incubation,
wash slides in PBS or TBS three times for 5 minutes each. 2. Apply
secondary antibody to sections and incubate for 30 minutes at room
temperature.
Detection: 1. Wash slides with PBS or TBS three times for 5 minutes
each. 2. Apply DAB substrate and monitor staining development
under a microscope. Development typically takes 2-10 minutes. 3.
Stop the reaction by rinsing slides in distilled water.
Counterstaining: 1. Immerse sections in hematoxylin for 30 seconds
to 2 minutes. 2. Rinse in running tap water and differentiate in 0.5%
acid alcohol if needed. 3. Wash in running tap water until sections are
blue.
Mounting: 1. Dehydrate through graded alcohol (70%, 95%, 100%)
and clear in xylene. 2. Mount coverslips using a resinous mounting
medium.
Quality Control: 1. Run positive control sections to confirm the
specificity and sensitivity of the assay. 2. Use negative control
sections (no primary antibody) to evaluate non-specific binding.
Reporting Results: 1. Evaluate staining using a bright-field
microscope. - Positive Staining: Presence of CLAUDIN 18 typically in
membrane/nucleus of cancer cells. - Negative Staining: Absence of
staining in negative control and specific areas of tested tissue. 2.
Record the intensity and distribution of staining semi-quantitatively: -
0: No staining - 1+: Weak staining - 2+: Moderate staining - 3+:
Strong staining 3. Document findings in the laboratory information
system (LIS), ensuring data accuracy and completeness.
Method Limitations: 1. Refer to manufacturer’s instructions for any
limitations related to specific reagent use or expected performance.
2. Variability in tissue processing and handling can affect assay
results. Ensure standardized protocols are adhered to in pre-
analytical phases.

carcinoma.
Conclusion: Adhering to this SOP will help ensure consistent and
accurate detection and semi-quantification of CLAUDIN 18 in tissue
samples. Regular review and adjustments based on QC outcomes
will be essential in maintaining the reliability of the
immunohistochemical assays.
