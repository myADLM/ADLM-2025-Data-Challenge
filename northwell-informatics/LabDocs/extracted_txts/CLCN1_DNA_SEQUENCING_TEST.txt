Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for CLCN1 DNA
Sequencing Test
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the analytical procedures for the
CLCN1 DNA sequencing test which is used to diagnose myotonia
congenita by identifying mutations in the CLCN1 gene.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel performing the CLCN1
DNA sequencing test.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory staff to perform all
steps in the analytical phase meticulously and to document the
process accurately. Supervisors are responsible for ensuring that all
procedures are followed and that any issues are addressed promptly.
4. DEFINITION
CLCN1: The gene encoding the chloride channel protein CLC-1,
mutations in which can cause myotonia congenita.
5. PROCEDURE
A. DNA Extraction
1. Refer to the DNA extraction SOP for procedures on extracting
DNA from the specimen. Ensure that the DNA meets the
required concentration and purity (A260/A280 ratio between 1.8
and 2.0).
B. PCR Amplification
1. Reagents and Equipment:
◦ Primers specific to the CLCN1 gene
◦ PCR reagents (e.g., Taq polymerase, dNTPs, buffer, MgCl2)
◦ Thermal cycler
2. Procedure:
◦ Prepare the PCR master mix according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Add genomic DNA (approximately 100 ng) to the master
mix.
◦ Program the thermal cycler with the following conditions:
1. Initial denaturation: 95°C for 5 minutes
2. Denaturation: 95°C for 30 seconds
3. Annealing: According to the melting temperature of
primers (Tm-5°C) for 30 seconds
4. Extension: 72°C for 1 minute per kb of expected
product
5. Final extension: 72°C for 10 minutes
6. Hold: 4°C
◦ Run 35 cycles of denaturation, annealing, and extension.
3. Check the amplified products via agarose gel electrophoresis to
confirm successful amplification.
C. PCR Product Purification
1. Purify the PCR products using a commercial PCR purification
kit according to the manufacturer's instructions.
2. Measure the concentration and purity of the purified DNA using
a spectrophotometer.
D. Sequencing Reaction
1. Reagents and Equipment:
◦ BigDye® Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit
◦ Sequencing primers
◦ Sequencing buffer
◦ Thermal cycler
2. Procedure:
◦ Prepare the sequencing reaction mixture following the
manufacturer's protocol.
◦ Add purified PCR products to the reaction mixture.
◦ Program the thermal cycler with the following conditions:
1. Initial denaturation: 96°C for 1 minute
2. Denaturation: 96°C for 10 seconds
3. Annealing: 50°C for 5 seconds
4. Extension: 60°C for 4 minutes
◦ Run 25 cycles of denaturation, annealing, and extension.
E. Purification of Sequencing Products
1. Purify the sequencing reaction products using ethanol
precipitation or a commercial purification kit according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
F. Sequencing and Data Analysis
1. Load the purified sequencing products onto an automated
sequencer (e.g., ABI 3500 Genetic Analyzer).
2. Perform the sequencing run according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
3. Analyze the sequencing data with appropriate software (e.g.,
SeqScape Software).
4. Compare the sequence data to the reference CLCN1 sequence
using bioinformatics tools.
5. Identify and document any mutations or variants present in the
CLCN1 gene.
G. Interpretation and Reporting
1. Review the sequencing results and confirm the presence of
variants.
2. Interpret the clinical significance of identified variants based on
available literature and databases (e.g., ClinVar, HGMD).
3. Draft a report summarizing the findings, including any detected
pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants, and their clinical
relevance.
4. The final report must be reviewed and approved by a qualified
medical geneticist or a certified laboratory director before being
released to the ordering clinician.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include positive and negative controls in each batch of PCR and
sequencing runs.
• Ensure that all reagents are within their expiration dates and have
been stored properly.
• Document any deviations from the protocol and corrective actions
taken.
• Regularly participate in external quality assessment programs to
ensure the accuracy and reliability of sequencing results.
7. SAFETY
• Follow all laboratory safety protocols, including wearing
appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE).
• Handle all biological specimens as potentially infectious material.
• Dispose of all waste, including PCR and sequencing reagents,
according to the laboratory's hazardous waste disposal
guidelines.
8. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions for DNA extraction, PCR amplification,
sequencing kits, and sequencing instruments.
• Relevant clinical and scientific literature on CLCN1 gene
mutations and myotonia congenita.
This SOP must be reviewed and updated annually or whenever a
procedural change is implemented.
