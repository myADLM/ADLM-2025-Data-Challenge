Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for CLIR Supplemental Report
Analysis
1. PURPOSE
To define the process for generating results for the CLIR
(Collaborative Laboratory Integrated Reports) Supplemental Report,
ensuring accuracy, reliability, and timeliness of results used in clinical
decision-making.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for adhering to
this procedure.
• Supervisors ensure compliance, provide guidance, and address
any issues that may arise during the process.
1. DEFINITION
The CLIR Supplemental Report involves secondary analysis of data
obtained from primary assays to provide additional clinical insights.
This process includes data extraction, validation, analysis, and
reporting.
1. PROCEDURE
A) Data Extraction and Validation:
1. Extract data from primary assays and clinical databases as
required for the supplemental analysis.
2. Validate the extracted data for completeness and accuracy:
◦ Cross-check data with the primary database.
◦ Ensure all necessary data points (e.g., patient ID, assay
results, timestamps) are included.
3. Document any discrepancies and resolve them before
progressing to the next step.
B) Data Analysis:
1. Utilize validated software tools and algorithms recommended
by CLIR for data analysis.
2. Input the validated dataset into the analysis software.
3. Set the appropriate parameters and controls as specified in the
CLIR guidelines.
4. Run the analysis, ensuring real-time monitoring to catch any
errors or software malfunctions.
5. After the analysis is complete, review the preliminary results for
consistency and logical accuracy.
◦ Cross-check results with known controls and benchmarks.
C) Quality Control:
1. Implement standard internal quality control processes to ensure
result accuracy.
◦ Analyze known QC samples alongside patient samples to
verify system performance.
◦ Document quality control results and address deviations as
necessary following standard QC procedures.
2. Repeat analysis if the QC results are outside acceptable limits
per CLIR recommendations.
3. Document all QC results and any corrective actions taken in the
Quality Control Log.
D) Report Generation:
1. Generate the CLIR Supplemental Report using the finalized
analysis results.
◦ Include all necessary patient identifiers and assay results.
◦ Ensure that all graphs, tables, and annotations follow CLIR
formatting guidelines.
2. Verify the report details:
◦ Cross-check each data entry for accuracy.
◦ Ensure consistency in units, terminology, and reference
intervals.
3. Obtain supervisory review:
◦ Present the generated report to the designated supervisor
for final review and approval.
◦ Address any supervisor feedback and make necessary
corrections.
E) Report Distribution and Documentation:
1. Upload the finalized CLIR Supplemental Report to the
Laboratory Information System (LIS) for physician access.
2. Ensure that all electronic files related to the supplemental report
are stored securely in compliance with data protection
protocols.
3. Document the entire process, including data extraction,
validation steps, analysis run ID, QC results, supervisory
review, and the final report generation in the laboratory’s central
record-keeping system.
F) Troubleshooting and Issue Resolution:
1. Maintain a log of any issues encountered during the analysis
process.
2. Follow standard protocols to resolve common issues (e.g.,
software errors, data discrepancies).
3. Escalate unresolved issues to the designated supervisor for
further investigation and action.
4. REFERENCES
Refer to CLIR guidelines (latest edition) for detailed instructions on
data analysis parameters, software tools, and reporting formats.
1. ADDITIONAL NOTES
Any deviations from the established SOP must be documented with
rationale and approved by the laboratory supervisor.
1. REVISION HISTORY
Document any updates or revisions to this SOP, including the date of
the change and a brief description of the revision.
