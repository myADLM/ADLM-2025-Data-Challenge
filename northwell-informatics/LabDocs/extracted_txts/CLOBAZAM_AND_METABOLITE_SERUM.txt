Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Analysis of Clobazam and Metabolite in Serum
1. PURPOSE
To outline the step-by-step procedure for the accurate measurement
of clobazam and its metabolite in serum using High-Performance
Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) coupled with Mass Spectrometry
(MS).
Responsibility:
• All laboratory personnel performing the procedure must be
properly trained and competent in HPLC-MS operation and
maintenance.
• Laboratory supervisors must ensure that all personnel follow this
SOP and that the equipment is properly maintained and
calibrated.
2. DEFINITION
Clobazam is a 1,5-benzodiazepine anticonvulsant, and its active
metabolite is N-desmethylclobazam. This analysis quantifies the
concentration of clobazam and its metabolite in patient serum
samples to aid in therapeutic drug monitoring.
3. PROCEDURE
A) Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies:
• HPLC system coupled with MS (HPLC-MS)
• Analytical balance
• Volumetric flasks and pipettes
• Calibration standards of clobazam and N-desmethylclobazam
• Internal standard (e.g., diazepam)
• Mobile phase solvents (e.g., acetonitrile, methanol, water, formic
acid)
• Serum samples
• Centrifuge
• Solid Phase Extraction (SPE) cartridges
• Vortex mixer
• Disposable gloves, lab coat, safety glasses
B) Preparation:
1. Standard and Internal Standard Preparation:
1. Prepare stock solutions of clobazam, N-
desmethylclobazam, and the internal standard in
methanol.
2. Dilute the stock solutions with an equal mixture of
acetonitrile and water to prepare working standards of
known concentrations.
3. Store standards at –20°C when not in use.
2. Preparation of Calibration Curve:
1. Prepare a series of calibration standards by spiking drug-
free human serum with known concentrations of
clobazam and N-desmethylclobazam.
2. Include a blank sample (serum with no added drugs).
3. Sample Preparation:
1. Thaw patient serum samples and vortex to mix
thoroughly.
2. Aliquot 0.2 mL of sample into a labeled tube.
3. Add 0.1 mL of internal standard solution to each sample
and vortex for 30 seconds.
4. Load samples onto SPE cartridges preconditioned with
methanol and water.
5. Wash SPE cartridges with water and elute analytes with
methanol.
6. Evaporate the eluent under a gentle stream of nitrogen
and reconstitute the residue in 0.2 mL of the mobile
phase.
C) HPLC-MS Analysis:
1. System Setup:
1. Set up the HPLC-MS system following manufacturer
instructions.
2. Prepare the mobile phase: usually, a mixture of
acetonitrile and water with 0.1% formic acid works well.
3. Equilibrate the column with the mobile phase for at least
30 minutes before analyses.
4. Program the gradient elution profile for the HPLC system.
2. Running the Samples:
1. Inject calibration standards, quality control samples, and
serum extracts into the HPLC-MS system.
2. Ensure all system suitability criteria (such as peak shape,
retention time, and system pressure) are met with the first
few runs.
3. Analyze samples and record detector responses (MS
signals).
3. Data Acquisition and Processing:
1. Identify the peaks corresponding to clobazam, N-
desmethylclobazam, and the internal standard based on
retention times and mass-to-charge ratios (m/z).
2. Integrate the peak areas and calculate the concentrations
using the calibration curve.
3. Ensure that both the calibration and internal standards fall
within the accepted range for each run. If not, the sample
must be re-analyzed.
D) Quality Control:
1. Include at least two levels of quality control samples in each
analytical run (e.g., low, mid, and high concentration).
2. Review quality control results to ensure they fall within the
specified range before accepting data from the run.
3. Record and investigate any deviations, implementing corrective
actions if necessary.
E) Reporting:
1. Transmit the final concentrations to the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
2. Ensure results are reviewed and verified by the technologist
before being reported.
3. Document all results, quality control findings, and any issues
encountered during the analysis process.
F) Safety Considerations:
• Handle all biological specimens with standard precautions.
• Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) at all
times in the lab.
• Follow the safety protocols and disposal procedures for chemical
reagents and biological waste.
