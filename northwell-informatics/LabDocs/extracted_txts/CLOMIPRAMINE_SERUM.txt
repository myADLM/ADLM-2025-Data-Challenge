STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES: Analytical Phase for
CLOMIPRAMINE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE To outline the procedure for analyzing serum
clomipramine levels to ensure accurate and reliable results.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for
performing and documenting the analysis of serum clomipramine
levels. It is the responsibility of all staff to ensure adherence to this
protocol to provide accurate and timely results.
1. DEFINITION Clomipramine is a tricyclic antidepressant used
primarily for the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder.
Accurate measurement of clomipramine serum levels is critical
for effective patient management.
2. PROCEDURE
A) Equipment and Supplies:
• High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system
equipped with a UV detector
• HPLC-grade solvents (Methanol, Acetonitrile, Water)
• Clomipramine standards
• Internal standard (as specified in the method)
• Serum sample collection tubes
• Vortex mixer
• Centrifuge
B) Reagents:
• Mobile phase components (Methanol, Acetonitrile, Water)
• Clomipramine reference standard
• Internal standard working solution
• Calibration curves
C) Sample Preparation:
1. Specimen Collection:
◦ Collect blood in a serum separator tube (SST).
◦ Allow the blood to clot at room temperature for 30 minutes.
◦ Centrifuge the SST at 1,500 x g for 10 minutes to separate
the serum.
◦ Transfer serum to a clean, labeled tube.
◦ Refrigerate serum samples at 2-8°C until analysis.
2. Preparation:
◦ Pipette 500 µL of serum into a clean microcentrifuge tube.
◦ Add 50 µL of the internal standard working solution.
◦ Vortex the sample for 30 seconds.
◦ Add 1 mL of extraction solvent (Acetonitrile or Methanol).
◦ Vortex for 2 minutes.
◦ Centrifuge at 3,000 x g for 5 minutes.
◦ Collect the supernatant and transfer it to a clean LC vial.
D) Calibration and Quality Control:
1. Preparation of Calibration Standards:
◦ Prepare calibration standards of clomipramine in serum
matrix at concentrations ranging from 0.05 µg/mL to 1.0 µg/
mL.
◦ Use identical sample processing as for patient samples.
2. Quality Control Samples:
◦ Include low, medium, and high concentration quality control
(QC) samples along with each batch of patient samples.
E) HPLC Analysis:
1. Instrument Setup:
◦ Set HPLC system parameters according to the
manufacturer's instructions and method validation guide.
▪ Column: C18 reverse-phase HPLC column
▪ Mobile Phase: Gradient of Methanol/Electrolyte buffer
▪ Flow Rate: 1.0 mL/min
▪ UV Detection: 254 nm
2. Sample Injection:
◦ Inject 20 µL of serum extract into the HPLC system.
◦ Record chromatogram and peak areas for clomipramine and
the internal standard.
F) Calculation:
1. Determine the concentration of clomipramine:
◦ Use the calibration curve generated from the standards.
◦ The peak area ratio of clomipramine to the internal standard
is used for quantification.
◦ Verify against QC samples to ensure accuracy.
G) Reporting Results:
1. Review data:
◦ Check chromatography for peak quality and integration
errors.
◦ Ensure all QC samples are within acceptable limits.
2. Transmit results:
◦ Results should be automatically uploaded to the Laboratory
Information System (LIS) if interfaced.
◦ Manual entry must be reviewed and verified by the
technologist.
H) Documentation:
• Record all pertinent details, including specimen ID, instrument
settings, analysis date, calibration curve, QC results, and any
troubleshooting steps.
• Maintain records for minimum of 2 years.
1. QUALITY CONTROL: Ensure that all QC samples fall within
the predetermined acceptable range. If QC fails:
◦ Perform instrument troubleshooting and recalibrate if
necessary.
◦ Repeat analysis with QC samples.
◦ Document any deviations and corrective measures taken.
2. REFERENCES: Refer to the method validation document and
HPLC system manufacturer’s manual for detailed instructions
on the instrument setup, sample preparation, and analysis.
Safety Precautions:
• Follow laboratory safety protocols including the handling of blood
products and chemicals.
• Use Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) including lab coats,
gloves, and eye protection.
Appendices:
• Detailed steps for HPLC maintenance.
• Troubleshooting guide for common errors in chromatography.
• Reference intervals for serum clomipramine levels.
By adhering to the above protocol, the laboratory ensures the
accuracy and reliability of clomipramine serum level testing,
permitting effective patient management and treatment adjustments.
