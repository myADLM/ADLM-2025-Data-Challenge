Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Clonidine (Catapres)
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedure for the analytical
phase of generating results for Clonidine (Catapres) to ensure
accuracy, precision, and reproducibility in testing.
Responsibility: It is the responsibility of designated staff to perform,
monitor, and document all aspects of the procedure as defined. It is
also the responsibility of staff to identify deficiencies in the process
and notify a supervisor.
1. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel performing analytical
tests to generate Clonidine (Catapres) results.
1. DEFINITION
Clonidine is an alpha-2 adrenergic agonist used primarily to treat high
blood pressure. Its testing is pertinent for therapeutic drug monitoring
and in cases of potential overdose.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred Specimen:
• Serum or plasma collected in a heparinized or EDTA tube.
• Collect 5 mL of blood, which yields about 2.5 mL of serum or
plasma.
• The specimen should be processed (spun down) within 1 hour of
collection and stored at 4°C if not analyzed immediately.
• For delayed analysis, the specimen can be frozen at -20°C if
processed within 8 hours of collection.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed samples
• Specimens older than 8 hours if not frozen
• Specimens collected in sodium fluoride or citrate tubes
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) system with a
UV detector
• Analytical balance
• Centrifuge
• Micropipettes and tips
• Water bath
Reagents:
• Clonidine standard solutions (traceable to NIST)
• Mobile phase (typically a mixture of acetonitrile and water with
0.1% formic acid)
• Calibration curves covering the therapeutic and toxic ranges
• Quality control material at multiple levels
Supplies:
• HPLC columns suitable for clonidine separation
• Sample vials
• Filters for mobile phase
1. ANALYTICAL PROCEDURE
6.1. Calibration and Quality Control:
a) Prepare calibration standards and quality controls according to manufacturer instructions.
b) Calibrate the HPLC system using the prepared standards.
c) Run quality control samples at the beginning of each batch to ensure system suitability.
6.2. Sample Preparation:
a) Use an appropriate volume (e.g., 0.5 mL) of serum/plasma for analysis.
b) Add an internal standard to each sample, calibration standard, and quality control.
c) Vortex samples for thorough mixing.
d) Centrifuge samples at 3,000 rpm for 10 minutes.
e) Transfer the supernatant to clean vials for HPLC analysis.
6.3. HPLC Analysis:
a) Set up the HPLC system: equilibrate column with the mobile phase for at least 30 minutes.
b) Inject sample extracts (20 μL or optimized volume) into the HPLC.
c) Run the samples and monitor the detector response.
d) Identify Clonidine peaks by comparing retention times with the calibration standards.
6.4. Data Analysis:
a) Generate chromatograms and calculate the concentration of Clonidine using the calibration curve.
b) Ensure all quality control samples are within acceptable limits before reporting any patient results.
c) Document any deviations or issues observed during the analysis.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
a) Cross-check results with established reference ranges. b)
Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS). c)
Verify and validate results according to laboratory protocols.
2. QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE
a) Perform bi-weekly and monthly quality control checks as
outlined. b) Use external quality control samples to verify assay
performance routinely. c) Document all quality control results
and take corrective action if results fall outside of acceptable
limits.
3. SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS
a) Use personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves
and lab coats when handling biological specimens and
hazardous chemicals. b) Dispose of biohazardous waste
according to regulatory guidelines. c) Follow all laboratory
safety protocols to minimize exposure to hazardous
substances.
4. REFERENCES
a) Manufacturer's instructions for the HPLC system and
reagents. b) Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI)
guidelines for therapeutic drug monitoring. c) Relevant peer-
reviewed literature on the analytical method for Clonidine
(Catapres).
5. REVIEW AND DOCUMENTATION
a) Review this SOP annually or whenever significant procedural
changes occur. b) Document any updates and redistribute the
SOP to all laboratory staff.
By adhering to these guidelines, the laboratory ensures high-quality
and reliable results for Clonidine (Catapres) analysis. All deviations or
significant findings should be reported to the laboratory supervisor
immediately.
