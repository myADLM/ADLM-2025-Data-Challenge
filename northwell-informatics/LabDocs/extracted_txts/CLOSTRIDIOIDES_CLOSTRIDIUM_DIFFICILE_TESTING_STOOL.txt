Standard Operating Procedure for Clostridioides (Clostridium)
difficile Testing, Stool
1. PURPOSE
This SOP provides guidelines for the analytical phase of processing
stool specimens to detect Clostridioides (Clostridium) difficile. This
procedure includes steps for performing assays and documenting
results. Appropriate corrective actions are outlined to ensure the
reliability and accuracy of test results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of trained laboratory personnel to perform the
testing according to this protocol, ensure quality control measures
are adhered to, and document the results accurately. Supervisors are
responsible for overseeing compliance with this protocol and
addressing any issues related to the testing process.
3. DEFINITIONS
Clostridioides difficile (C. difficile) is a bacterium that can cause
symptoms ranging from diarrhea to life-threatening inflammation of
the colon. Timely and accurate detection of C. difficile toxins in stool
specimens is crucial for patient management.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred Specimen:
• Freshly collected stool sample (not formed or visibly
contaminated).
• Specimen collected in a clean, dry container without
preservatives.
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Stool specimens that are formed.
• Specimens submitted in containers with preservatives or transport
media.
• Specimens delayed in transportation exceeding 72 hours at room
temperature or refrigeration.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Test Kits (e.g., Enzyme Immunoassay (EIA), PCR assays)
• Specimen collection kits
• Disposable pipettes
• Timer
• Pipettors and tips
• Personal protective equipment (gloves, lab coats, etc.)
• Refrigerated storage units
• Calibration and quality control materials
6. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation of Specimen
• Confirm all patient and specimen information.
• Mix the stool specimen thoroughly using a disposable spatula or
equivalent.
• Aliquot the necessary volume for testing according to the kit
manufacturer’s instructions.
B) Running the Assay
• Allow all reagents and specimen to reach room temperature.
• Set up the assay in accordance with the manufacturer’s
instructions.
• Pipette the required volume of the specimen or dilution to the
appropriate wells or tubes.
• Add reagents as specified, maintaining precise timing throughout
the process.
• Incubate the reaction mixtures at the specified temperature and
duration.
• Wash steps should be performed as outlined to remove unbound
materials.
• Add substrate solution and allow the reaction to develop.
• Stop the reaction at the appropriate time as specified in the assay
protocol.
• Measure absorbance or read results using the recommended
equipment (e.g., a microplate reader for EIA).
C) Result Interpretation
• Compare sample readings to the positive and negative control
values.
• Refer to the specific kit’s interpretation guidelines to determine if
the result is positive, negative, or equivocal.
• Document all the results, including control outcomes, in the
laboratory information system (LIS).
D) Quality Control
• Run positive and negative controls with each batch of tests.
• Ensure that control results are within acceptable ranges before
interpreting patient results.
• Record control results in the Quality Control Log.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results are automatically transmitted to the LIS and must be
reviewed and verified by the technologist.
• Use standardized reporting terminology as approved by the
laboratory guidelines.
• Critical results should be highlighted and communicated to the
physician promptly following the lab's critical value policy.
8. TROUBLESHOOTING AND CORRECTIVE ACTIONS
• If control results do not meet acceptance criteria, re-run the
controls one additional time. If they still fail, halt patient testing
and notify the supervisor.
• Equipment malfunctions or irregularities noted during the assay
should be addressed according to equipment-specific
troubleshooting guides.
• Record all troubleshooting steps and corrective actions taken in
the laboratory log.
9. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s package insert for the test kit used.
• Laboratory Quality Control Guidelines.
• Relevant articles and standard resources on C. difficile testing.
10. REVIEW AND DOCUMENTATION
• This SOP should be reviewed annually or whenever there is a
change in testing methodology, equipment, or testing materials.
• Document all reviews and changes in the SOP review log.
By following this protocol, we ensure accurate and reliable results for
C. difficile testing, which is essential for effective patient management
and safety.
