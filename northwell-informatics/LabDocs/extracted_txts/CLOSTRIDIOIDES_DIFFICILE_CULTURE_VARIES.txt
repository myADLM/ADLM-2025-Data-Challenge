Standard Operating Procedure: Clostridioides difficile (C. difficile)
Culture
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to provide a standardized method
for performing C. difficile culture to accurately identify and isolate the
organism from stool specimens. This protocol ensures that the
process for culturing C. difficile is consistent, reproducible, and
adheres to quality control guidelines.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing the
culture, monitoring quality control, and generating results according
to this SOP. Laboratory supervisors are responsible for ensuring
personnel are adequately trained and adhere to the SOP.
1. MATERIALS AND REAGENTS
Specimen Collection:
• Adequate amount of freshly collected stool specimen in a sterile
container within 24 hours of collection.
• Stool specimens should be refrigerated at 2-8°C if there is a delay
in processing.
Media and Reagents:
• Cycloserine-cefoxitin-fructose agar (CCFA) or other selective
media for C. difficile.
• Blood agar plates (BAP)
• Brain Heart Infusion Broth (BHI) or other appropriate enrichment
broth
• Ethanol shock solution (96% ethanol in sterile water)
• Sterile swabs
• Sterile saline
• Anaerobic gas pack and jar for creating anaerobic conditions
• Incubator set at 35-37°C
• Quality control strains (e.g., C. difficile ATCC 43255)
• Gram stains and reagents
• Latex agglutination test kits or PCR for confirmatory testing
1. PROCEDURE
Specimen Processing: A. Direct Inoculation:
1. Perform ethanol shock treatment on the specimen. Mix an
equal volume of stool sample with 96% ethanol in a sterile tube
and incubate for 30 minutes at room temperature.
2. After ethanol shock treatment, centrifuge the mixture at 2500g
for 10 minutes to pellet the bacteria.
3. Discard the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 1 mL of
sterile saline.
4. Using a sterile swab, inoculate the selective CCFA plate with
the concentrated sample. Streak for isolation.
5. Inoculate a BHI broth with 0.1 mL of the concentrated sample
for enrichment culture.
B. Enrichment Culture:
1. Incubate all inoculated selective agar plates and enrichment
broth at 35-37°C for 48-72 hours under anaerobic conditions.
2. Examine the selective media plates after 48 hours. If no
colonies suggestive of C. difficile appear, reincubate for an
additional 24 hours (72 hours total).
3. IDENTIFICATION OF C. DIFFICILE
Morphology:
1. Observe cultured plates for typical C. difficile colonies which
appear as flat, ground-glass, yellow colonies on CCFA.
2. Perform Gram staining on suspect colonies. C. difficile appears
as Gram-positive, rod-shaped bacilli with subterminal spores.
Confirmatory Testing:
1. Perform specific confirmatory tests such as latex agglutination,
enzymatic immunoassays (EIAs), or PCR for the detection of C.
difficile toxins A and B.
2. QUALITY CONTROL
3. Utilize quality control strains (e.g., C. difficile ATCC 43255) to
ensure media performance.
4. Include positive and negative controls in each batch of tests
performed.
5. Document all QC results in the quality control log. QC failure
should be addressed and rectified before reporting patient
results.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
7. Report culture results as positive or negative for C. difficile.
8. Include results of toxin tests or molecular PCR assays in the
final report.
9. REFERENCE INTERVALS
N/A for culture tests. Results reported as positive or negative.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
2. Overgrowth of other fecal flora may inhibit the isolation of C.
difficile.
3. Specimens not stored or transported properly may yield false-
negative results.
4. Enrichment broth is critical for specimens with low organism
counts.
