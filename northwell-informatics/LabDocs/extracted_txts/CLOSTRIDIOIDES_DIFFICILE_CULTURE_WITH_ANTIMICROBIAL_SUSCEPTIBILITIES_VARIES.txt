Clostridioides difficile Culture with Antimicrobial
Susceptibilities
1. PURPOSE:
The purpose of this protocol is to provide standardized procedures
for isolating and identifying Clostridioides difficile from clinical
specimens and performing antimicrobial susceptibility testing to guide
appropriate therapeutic interventions.
RESPONSIBILITY:
Laboratory staff are responsible for following these procedures to
ensure accurate and reliable results.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS:
Specimen Types:
• Stool samples are the preferred specimens for C. difficile culture.
Specimen Collection:
• Collect stool in a sterile container.
• Ensure specimens are labeled legibly with patient identification
and collection date/time.
• Refrigerate specimens promptly and transport to the laboratory as
soon as possible.
• Reject specimens that are not properly labeled, are leaking, or
have been stored for longer than 72 hours before arrival.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES:
Equipment:
• Anaerobic chamber or jars.
• Incubators set to 35-37°C.
• Refrigerators (2-8°C).
• Biosafety cabinets.
• Centrifuge.
Reagents:
• Cycloserine-cefoxitin-fructose agar (CCFA) plates.
• Blood agar plates.
• Anaerobic indicator.
• C. difficile control strains.
Supplies:
• Sterile loops.
• Anaerobic gas packs.
• Incubation bags.
• Sterile containers for specimens.
• Antimicrobial susceptibility disks.
• Mueller-Hinton agar plates.
• E-test strips or broth microdilution panels for susceptibility testing.
4. PROCEDURE:
Culture:
1. Specimen Processing:
◦ Mix stool specimen thoroughly.
◦ Inoculate specimen directly onto CCFA agar using a sterile
loop.
◦ Streak for isolation and cover the plate with parafilm or
place in an anaerobic incubation bag with indicator.
◦ Incubate at 35-37°C for 48-72 hours under anaerobic
conditions.
2. Isolation and Identification:
◦ Examine plates for colonies typical of C. difficile (yellow,
ground-glass appearance, with characteristic odor).
◦ Sub-culture suspected colonies to blood agar plate and
incubate under anaerobic conditions for further
identification.
3. Confirmatory Testing:
◦ Perform gram staining (C. difficile appears as gram-positive
rods).
◦ Conduct biochemical tests (e.g., gelatin hydrolysis, indole
production).
◦ Carry out toxin testing (either ELISA, PCR, or cytotoxicity
assay) to confirm toxin production.
Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing:
1. in vitro susceptibility tests:
◦ Use Mueller-Hinton agar (supplemented with 5%
defibrinated sheep blood) to prepare inoculum with isolated
C. difficile colony.
◦ Perform disk diffusion or E-test following CLSI guidelines
specific for anaerobes.
◦ Use broth microdilution panels if automated testing
platforms are available.
◦ Incubate all susceptibility plates under anaerobic conditions
at 35-37°C as per manufacturer's guidelines.
2. Interpretation:
◦ Measure zone diameters for disk diffusion or read MIC
directly from panels.
◦ Compare results to reference standards (e.g., CLSI M100
guidelines) for interpretation.
◦ Ensure quality control by running C. difficile control strains in
parallel.
Quality Control:
1. Perform routine quality control (e.g., accuracy/reproducibility)
using standardized C. difficile strains.
2. Validate new lots of media and reagents using control strains.
3. Maintain records of quality control results for review.
5. REPORTING RESULTS:
• Report culture results as positive or negative for C. difficile.
• Report antimicrobial susceptibilities according to CLSI
breakpoints.
• Note any resistant phenotypes and escalate reporting for clinical
intervention as required.
• If testing could not be performed due to sample or technical
issues, report as ‘Unable to determine susceptibility; repeat test
recommended’ when appropriate.
Critical Results:
• Communicate findings of toxin-positive C. difficile immediately to
the relevant healthcare provider.
References:
• CLSI Guidelines for Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (M100).
• Manufacturer instructions for CCFA, Blood agar, and susceptibility
testing kits.
• Relevant peer-reviewed journal articles and clinical laboratory
standards.
NOTE:
These protocols are subject to revision based on emerging data,
supplier manuals, adjustments in reference standards, and
incorporation of new technologies.
Validation and Confirmation:
• The procedure and its results shall be reviewed periodically,
validated with proficiency testing, and confirmed through internal
and external audits as per accreditation and regulatory
compliance (e.g., CAP, CLIA).
This SOP is effective as of its approval date and supersedes previous
versions.
