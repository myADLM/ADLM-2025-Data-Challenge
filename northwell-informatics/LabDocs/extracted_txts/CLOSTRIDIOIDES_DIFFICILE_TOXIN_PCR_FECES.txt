SOP for PCR Detection of Clostridioides difficile Toxin in Fecal
Specimens
1. PURPOSE
This procedure details the analytical process for detecting
Clostridioides difficile toxin genes in fecal specimens using real-time
Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) to identify the presence of toxin-
producing strains. This method is preferred due to its high sensitivity
and specificity.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing
the PCR assay, including sample preparation, nucleic acid
extraction, PCR setup, and result analysis.
• All personnel must adhere to the protocols to maintain accurate
and reproducible results.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Acceptable specimens: Freshly collected fecal samples or stool
samples in Cary-Blair transport medium.
• The specimen should be kept at 2-8°C for up to 24 hours or at
-70°C for long-term storage.
• Specimens must be labeled accurately with patient ID, date, and
time of collection.
1. MATERIALS AND REAGENTS
• PCR workstation
• DNA extraction kit (validated for C. difficile)
• Real-time PCR instrument and associated software
• PCR reagents:
◦ Primers and probes specific for C. difficile toxin genes (tcdA,
tcdB)
◦ Master mix containing DNA polymerase, dNTPs, MgCl2, etc.
◦ Positive and negative controls
◦ Nuclease-free water
• Micropipettes and sterile filter tips
• Nuclease-free microcentrifuge tubes
• Gloves, lab coat, face shield
1. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation
• Wear proper PPE (Personal Protective Equipment) before starting
the procedure.
• Clean and disinfect the work area and equipment with a 10%
bleach solution followed by 70% isopropyl alcohol.
• Thaw all reagents and samples on ice or at 4°C before use.
Vortex and spin down briefly.
B) Nucleic Acid Extraction
1. Transfer 200 mg of fecal sample to a microcentrifuge tube.
2. Follow the manufacturer’s protocol for stool DNA extraction,
ensuring complete lysis and removal of inhibitors.
3. Elute the DNA in an appropriate volume of nuclease-free water
or elution buffer.
4. Measure DNA concentration and purity using a
spectrophotometer or fluorometer.
5. Store the extracted DNA at -20°C until analysis if not
proceeding immediately.
C) PCR Setup
1. Prepare the PCR master mix according to the kit instructions:
◦ 10 µL master mix
◦ 1 µL of each primer-probe mix
◦ 5 µL of extracted DNA (sample)
◦ Adjust the volume to 20 µL per reaction with nuclease-free
water.
2. Include appropriate controls:
◦ Positive control: DNA from a known C. difficile strain.
◦ Negative control: Nuclease-free water.
3. Mix the master mix by gentle pipetting.
4. Aliquot 20 µL of the master mix into each well of a PCR plate.
5. Seal the PCR plate with adhesive film to prevent evaporation.
D) PCR Amplification
1. Load the PCR plate into the real-time PCR instrument.
2. Program the PCR run using the following thermal cycling
conditions:
◦ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 10 minutes
◦ Amplification (45 cycles):
▪ Denaturation: 95°C for 15 seconds
▪ Annealing/Extension: 60°C for 1 minute (acquire data
during this step)
3. Start the PCR run.
E) Analysis of Results
1. At the end of the PCR run, analyze the amplification curves
using the software provided with the PCR instrument.
2. Determine the presence of target genes by evaluating the cycle
threshold (Ct) values:
◦ Positive: Ct value within the specified range of the positive
control.
◦ Negative: No Ct value or Ct value outside the acceptable
range.
3. Validate the run by ensuring controls have performed as
expected:
◦ Positive control must show appropriate amplification.
◦ Negative control must show no amplification.
4. REPORTING RESULTS
• Document the results in the laboratory information system (LIS).
• Positive results indicate the presence of toxin-producing C.
difficile and will be reported as "Detected".
• Negative results indicate the absence of toxin-producing C.
difficile and will be reported as "Not Detected".
• Notify the relevant healthcare provider promptly of positive
results, following clinical laboratory policies.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform quality control checks for each run using positive and
negative controls.
• Validate new batches of reagents and maintain records of their
performance.
• Participate in external proficiency testing programs to ensure
assay reliability.

1. REVISION HISTORY
• Document the dates of SOP reviews and changes made by the
responsible personnel.
By following this standardized protocol, accurate and reliable
detection of Clostridioides difficile toxin genes can be achieved using
PCR. This supports appropriate clinical management of patients
suspected of having C. difficile infections.
