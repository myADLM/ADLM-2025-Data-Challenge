Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for CLOVE, IGE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the steps for the analytical phase of generating
results for CLOVE (Clostridium difficile Toxin), Immunoglobulin E
(IGE), and Serum analysis. It ensures that results are generated
accurately and consistently according to standardized procedures.
1. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel responsible for the
analysis of CLOVE, IGE, and Serology samples.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
Laboratory personnel are responsible for following this SOP and
documenting the results. Supervisors are responsible for ensuring
that the procedure is adhered to and corrective actions are taken
when necessary.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• CLOVE: Fresh stool sample collected in a sterile container.
Process within 2 hours of collection or refrigerate at 2-8°C for up
to 72 hours.
• IGE: Serum sample collected in a red-topped tube or SST.
Centrifuge and separate serum within 2 hours of collection. Store
at 2-8°C if not processed immediately.
• SERUM: Blood sample collected in an SST or red-topped tube.
Centrifuge within 2 hours of collection to separate serum. Store at
2-8°C if not processed immediately.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Centrifuge
• Microplate reader
• Incubator
• ELISA kits or chemiluminescent reagents for IGE
• Specific reagents and kits for CLOVE and Serum analysis
• PPE (gloves, lab coats)
1. PROCEDURE
6.1 CLOVE Analysis A) Preparation
• Ensure stool samples are transported properly.
• Use a commercial C. difficile toxin assay kit.
B) Assay Procedure
• Follow the manufacturer's instructions for the assay kit.
• Add prepared reagents and stool samples to the microplate wells.
• Incubate the plate according to the time specified in the kit.
• Wash the wells to remove unbound components.
• Add detection reagents and incubate as instructed.
• Read the plate using a microplate reader at the specified
wavelength.
C) Result Interpretation
• Compare the absorbance values to the standard values provided
with the assay kit.
• Document results in the laboratory information system (LIS).
6.2 IGE Analysis A) Preparation
• Thaw stored serum samples if necessary and prepare according
to assay requirements.
• Prepare reagents and calibrators as specified.
B) Assay Procedure
• Use an ELISA or chemiluminescent assay for IGE measurement.
• Follow the manufacturer's instructions for reagent addition,
incubation, and washing steps.
• Read the plate or use the instrument according to the assay
method chosen.
C) Result Interpretation
• Calibrate the instrument and analyze controls to ensure validity.
• Compare patient results to the calibration curve.
• Document the concentration of IGE in the LIS.
6.3 SERUM Analysis A) Preparation
• Thaw stored serum samples if necessary.
• Prepare any specific reagents required for the serum panel tests.
B) Assay Procedure
• Follow the procedures for various serum analyte tests: electrolyte,
protein levels, enzymes, etc.
• Use automated or manual methods as appropriate.
• Calibrate equipment and perform quality control checks.
C) Result Interpretation
• Analyze the results using the provided reference ranges and
calibrations.
• Investigate any outliers or anomalies.
• Document all findings in the LIS.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform quality control by running known positive and negative
controls with each batch.
• Record QC results and take corrective actions if QC results fall
outside of acceptable ranges.
• Ensure that all instruments are regularly maintained and
calibrated.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Verify results against standard reference ranges.
• Document and confirm all results in the LIS.
• Notify the appropriate clinical personnel of critical values
according to laboratory policy.
