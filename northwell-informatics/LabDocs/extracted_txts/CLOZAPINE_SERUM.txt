Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Clozapine, Serum
1. PURPOSE
To provide the standard protocols for the analysis of Clozapine,
Serum in the laboratory setting ensuring accuracy and reliability of
test results.
Responsibility: Designated staff perform and document analytical
procedures. Supervisors ensure correct execution of procedures and
take corrective actions when necessary.
1. DEFINITIONS
Clozapine: An atypical antipsychotic medication used to treat
schizophrenia.
Serum: The component of blood obtained by removing clotting
factors.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred Specimen:
• 5 mL of serum collected in a serum separator tube (SST).
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens with insufficient volume.
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric specimens.
• Specimens received in improperly labeled containers or beyond
stability period.
Specimen Stability:
• Room temperature: 1 day
• Refrigerated (2-8°C): 7 days
• Frozen (-20°C or colder): up to 1 month
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) or LC-MS/MS
• Clozapine reference standards
• Mobile phases (solvents, buffers)
• Sample diluent
• Calibration controls (high, mid, low controls)
• Filter columns (if applicable)
• Pipettes and tips
1. PROCEDURE
Sample Preparation:
1. Thaw frozen serum samples at room temperature.
2. Allow refrigerated samples to reach room temperature before
analysis.
3. Centrifuge clot tubes at 1500-2000xg for 10 minutes; pipette off
serum into secondary tubes.
4. Dilute serum samples (if required) with sample diluent.
Calibration and Quality Control:
1. Prepare Clozapine calibration standards from stock solutions.
2. Run calibration curve to ensure linearity.
3. Analyze quality control samples at high, mid, and low levels,
ensuring results fall within acceptable ranges.
Analytical Procedure:
1. Set up HPLC or LC-MS/MS system following manufacturer’s
guidelines, ensuring all necessary calibrations and checks are
performed.
2. Inject standard, quality control, and patient serum samples into
the system.
3. Allow chromatographic separation; monitor Clozapine at
specific retention time.
4. Extract data and verify accuracy against calibration curves.
Reporting Results:
1. Review generated chromatograms for peak accuracy and
integrity.
2. Quantitate Clozapine concentration using established
calibration curve.
3. Verify results for quality control adherence.
4. Input results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
5. Include patient-specific reference ranges and comments
regarding interpretation if necessary.
6. CORRECTIVE ACTION
If Any QC or Calibration Fails:
1. Verify reagents and equipment function.
2. Re-run controls and calibrations.
3. If persistent issues, notify the supervisor and perform system
maintenance.
4. Document all corrective actions within the Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
5. QUALITY CONTROL AND MAINTENANCE
• Perform daily system checks to ensure the HPLC or LC-MS/MS
instrument’s functionality.
• Analyze quality control samples at the beginning, middle, and end
of the run to ensure consistent accuracy.
• Maintain instrument logs with calibration and maintenance
records.

• Clozapine assay manufacturer’s insert.
• Internal laboratory calibration curves and quality control
standards.
• Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) guidelines.
1. RECORDS AND DOCUMENTATION
All results, calibrations, quality control checks, and corrective
measures must be documented in the Laboratory Information System
(LIS) with appropriate timestamps and staff initials.
Note: This SOP ensures standardization and accuracy in the
analytical phase of Clozapine, serum testing procedures, aligning
with CLIA and laboratory protocols.
