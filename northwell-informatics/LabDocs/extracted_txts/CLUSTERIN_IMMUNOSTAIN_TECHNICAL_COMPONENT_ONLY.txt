CLUSTERIN IMMUNOSTAIN, TECHNICAL COMPONENT
ONLY
1. PURPOSE
To detail the procedure for performing Clusterin immunostaining on
tissue specimens for diagnostic purposes, focusing on the technical
component of the test.
2. SCOPE
This procedure is applicable to all technical staff involved in the
processing and staining of tissue specimens using Clusterin antibody
in the laboratory.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENT
• Acceptable specimens include formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded
(FFPE) tissue blocks.
• Specimens should be properly labeled with patient information
and appropriate requisition.
4. REAGENTS AND EQUIPMENT
• Clusterin primary antibody
• Secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (HRP)
• Buffer solutions (e.g., PBS)
• DAB (3,3'-diaminobenzidine) substrate kit
• Hematoxylin counterstain
• Positive and negative control slides
• Microtome
• Water bath
• Automated immunostainer (if available)
• Coverslips
• Mounting medium
5. PROCEDURE
A. SLIDE PREPARATION
1. Cut sections from the FFPE tissue block at 4 micrometer
thickness using a microtome.
2. Float sections on a warm water bath set at 40-45°C.
3. Mount sections on glass slides and dry at 60°C oven for at least
30 minutes.
B. ANTIGEN RETRIEVAL 4. Deparaffinize and rehydrate slides
using a series of xylene and ethanol washes. 5. Perform antigen
retrieval by immersing slides in a pre-warmed antigen retrieval
solution (e.g., citrate buffer) and heating at 95-100°C for 20 minutes.
Allow slides to cool.
C. IMMUNOSTAINING 6. Wash slides in PBS to remove residual
retrieval solution. 7. Block endogenous peroxidase activity by
incubating slides in 3% hydrogen peroxide solution for 10 minutes. 8.
Apply blocking buffer (e.g., protein block) for 20 minutes to reduce
non-specific binding. 9. Incubate slides with primary antibody
(Clusterin antibody) diluted appropriately according to the
manufacturer's recommendations for 60 minutes at room temperature
or as directed. 10. Wash slides in PBS to remove unbound primary
antibody.
D. DETECTION 11. Incubate slides with secondary antibody
conjugated to HRP for 30 minutes at room temperature. 12. Wash
slides in PBS. 13. Apply DAB substrate for color development,
monitoring closely until the desired intensity is achieved (typically
5-10 minutes). 14. Stop the reaction by washing slides in running tap
water.
E. COUNTERSTAIN 15. Counterstain with hematoxylin for 1-2
minutes. 16. Rinse slides in running tap water to bluing the
hematoxylin.
F. MOUNTING 17. Dehydrate slides using graded ethanol washes
followed by xylene. 18. Apply coverslips using appropriate mounting
medium.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run positive and negative control slides with each batch of patient
slides.
• Document all steps on a staining log, including reagent lot
numbers, incubation times, and any deviations from the standard
protocol.
7. REPORTING AND DOCUMENTATION
• Ensure proper labeling and documentation of all slides and
controls.
• Record any observed issues or deviations from expected staining
patterns and notify supervising pathologists.
8. MAINTENANCE OF EQUIPMENT
• Regularly check and calibrate all equipment used in the process.
• Maintain adequate inventory of all reagents and supplies.

10. REVIEW AND APPROVAL
This SOP should be reviewed annually or as needed if there are
changes in the procedure or guidelines. Approval should be
documented by signatures of the laboratory director and relevant
supervisory staff.
Responsible Personnel:
Laboratory Technicians:
• Perform immunostaining according to this SOP.
Supervisors:
• Monitor compliance and address deviations. Ensure proper
documentation and review.
By following this protocol, laboratory personnel can accurately
perform the technical component of Clusterin immunostaining,
providing valuable diagnostic information while ensuring consistent
and high-quality results.
