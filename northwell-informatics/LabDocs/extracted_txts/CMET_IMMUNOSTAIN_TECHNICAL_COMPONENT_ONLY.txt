Certainly! Below is a draft of the Standard Operating Procedures
(SOP) for the analytical phase of generating results for CMET
Immunostain, Technical Component Only.
Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for CMET Immunostain,
Technical Component Only
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this procedure is to outline the steps
required for the analytical phase of generating results for CMET
Immunostaining in tissue samples. This procedure focuses on the
technical component only.
2. SCOPE This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel performing
the CMET Immunostain procedure.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Designated laboratory staff are responsible for following this
procedure for CMET Immunostain.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring that staff are trained and
comply with this SOP.
• It is the responsibility of all laboratory personnel to report any
deviations or issues encountered during the procedure to a
supervisor.
4. DEFINITIONS
• CMET Immunostain: A laboratory technique used to detect the
presence of CMET protein in tissue samples.
• Technical Component: Includes the preparation, staining, and
initial quality control of the slides. Excludes interpretation and
reporting of results.
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE)
tissue blocks.
• Specimen Handling: Ensure FFPE tissue blocks are received in
good condition. Store at room temperature until use.
6. EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS
• Microtome
• Slide water bath
• Hot plate or slide warmer
• Immunostaining reagents and antibodies (cMET primary antibody,
secondary antibody, detection system)
• Positive control tissue slides
• Negative control tissue slides
• Automated or manual immunostaining system
• Coverslips and mounting medium
• Microscope
7. REAGENT PREPARATION AND STORAGE
• Prepare reagents according to manufacturer’s instructions.
• Store reagents at recommended temperatures.
• Record the preparation and expiration dates for all reagents.
8. PROCEDURE
A. Slide Preparation
1. Section the FFPE tissue block at 4 microns using a microtome.
2. Float the sections on a water bath set to 45-50°C and mount on
positively charged microscope slides.
3. Dry the slides at 60°C for 30-60 minutes or overnight at room
temperature.
B. Immunostaining
1. Perform deparaffinization and rehydration of slides:
◦ Place slides in xylene for 10 minutes, repeat twice.
◦ Rehydrate in decreasing concentrations of ethanol (100%,
95%, 70%), 2 minutes each, followed by distilled water
rinse.
2. Antigen Retrieval:
◦ Perform heat-induced epitope retrieval using the
recommended buffer (e.g., citrate buffer, pH 6.0) and
pressure cooker or microwave, as specified by the antibody
manufacturer.
3. Blocking:
◦ Apply blocking solution to the slides to prevent non-specific
binding. Incubate for the recommended time.
4. Primary Antibody Incubation:
◦ Apply CMET primary antibody to the slides and incubate for
the recommended time and temperature.
5. Secondary Antibody and Detection System:
◦ Apply secondary antibody and detection system as per
manufacturer’s instructions. Include appropriate washing
steps between applications.
6. Counterstaining:
◦ Counterstain with hematoxylin, if required.
◦ Rinse slides in distilled water followed by bluing in a weak
ammonia solution (optional).
7. Dehydration and Mounting:
◦ Dehydrate slides through graded alcohols and clear in
xylene.
◦ Mount with an appropriate mounting medium and coverslip.
C. Quality Control
1. Include positive and negative control slides alongside patient
samples with each batch of staining.
2. Check the control slides for appropriate staining reaction:
◦ Positive control should show specific staining in the target
antigen.
◦ Negative control should show no staining or only
background staining.
3. Review stained slides under a microscope to ensure quality of
staining.
9. RECORD KEEPING
• Document all steps taken during the staining procedure including
reagent lot numbers, incubation times, temperatures, and any
deviations or troubleshooting steps.
• Record results of quality control checks in a QC log.
10. INTERPRETATION AND REPORTING
• Technical personnel perform the staining and initial quality check.
• Interpretation of CMET Immunostain results is performed by a
pathologist or other qualified healthcare professional. This is
beyond the scope of this SOP focusing on the technical
component.
11. MAINTENANCE AND TROUBLESHOOTING
• Regularly check and maintain equipment according to
manufacturer guidelines.
• Troubleshoot any issues with staining by reviewing procedure
steps, reagent quality, and control results.
12. SAFETY PRECAUTIONS
• Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) including
lab coat, gloves, and eye protection.
• Handle all reagents and specimens according to their safety data
sheets (SDS) and laboratory safety protocols.
• Dispose of waste materials in compliance with biohazard
regulations.
13. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions for CMET primary antibody and
detection systems.
• Laboratory quality control and safety manuals.
14. REVIEW AND REVISION HISTORY
• Maintain a log of SOP reviews and revisions, including dates and
responsible personnel.
