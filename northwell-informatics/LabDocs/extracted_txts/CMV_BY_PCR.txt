Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Procedure for CMV DNA Detection by PCR
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized method for the detection of
Cytomegalovirus (CMV) DNA in clinical specimens using Polymerase
Chain Reaction (PCR).
RESPONSIBILITY
All designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing
the PCR analysis according to this SOP.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Acceptable Specimens:
• Whole blood collected in EDTA tubes.
• Plasma or serum.
• Urine.
• CSF (Cerebrospinal Fluid).
• Tissue biopsies.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens not collected in the appropriate containers.
• Specimens with significant hemolysis, contamination, or improper
labeling.
• Specimens collected more than 48 hours prior without proper
storage.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• PCR machine (Thermocycler).
• Refrigerated centrifuge.
• Vortex mixer.
• QIAamp DNA Mini Kit or equivalent DNA extraction kit.
• PCR reagents (Master mix, probes, primers specific for CMV).
• PCR-grade water.
• Disposable gloves, pipette tips, and tubes.
• UV sterilizer or biosafety cabinet.
4. PROCEDURE
A) DNA Extraction:
1. Wear gloves and lab coat.
2. Vortex and briefly centrifuge the specimen tube.
3. Transfer 200 µL of specimen to a labeled 1.5 mL
microcentrifuge tube.
4. Follow the steps outlined in the DNA extraction kit protocol.
◦ Ensure all sample tubes are tightly capped during
centrifugation.
◦ Ensure ethanol steps are completed efficiently to prevent
residual ethanol contamination.
5. Elute the DNA in 50 µL of PCR-grade water.
6. Store extracted DNA at -20°C until ready for PCR setup.
B) PCR Setup:
1. Thaw all PCR reagents and extracted DNA on ice.
2. Prepare the PCR master mix in a biosafety cabinet or PCR
workstation.
◦ According to kit instructions, mix primers, probes, master
mix, and PCR-grade water.
3. Aliquot 20 µL of the master mix into each PCR tube or plate
well.
4. Add 5 µL of extracted DNA to each PCR tube or plate well.
Ensure no cross-contamination.
5. Include positive control (known CMV DNA) and negative control
(PCR-grade water) in the setup.
6. Cap the tubes or seal the plate securely.
C) PCR Amplification:
1. Place the PCR tubes or plate into the thermocycler.
2. Program the thermocycler based on the following profile:
◦ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 5 minutes.
◦ 40 cycles of:
▪ Denaturation: 95°C for 15 seconds.
▪ Annealing: 60°C for 30 seconds.
▪ Extension: 72°C for 30 seconds.
◦ Final extension: 72°C for 5 minutes.
3. Start the PCR run.
4. Once completed, remove the tubes or plate and proceed to
analysis.
D) Result Interpretation:
1. Analyze the amplification results using the thermocycler's
software.
2. Verify the amplification curve for positive control.
3. Ensure no amplification in the negative control.
4. Review specimen's amplification curve. A positive result is
indicated by crossing the threshold cycle (Ct) within the PCR
dynamic range (Ct < 38).
5. Record the Ct values and interpret based on laboratory-defined
criteria for CMV DNA detection.
6. Report results as follows:
◦ Positive for CMV DNA if Ct < cutoff.
◦ Negative for CMV DNA if no amplification or Ct > cutoff.
◦ Indeterminate if amplification is detected late (e.g., Ct near
cutoff); recommend retesting.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform quality control checks including positive and negative
controls with each PCR run.
• Document all control results and ensure compliance with
acceptable ranges.
• Conduct proficiency testing as scheduled by the laboratory.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results are entered into the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
and reviewed by the technologist.
• Ensure timely reporting according to lab guidelines.
• Notify relevant healthcare personnel promptly of positive results.
7. SAFETY PRECAUTIONS
• Follow all biosafety guidelines, including the use of PPE (gloves,
lab coat, face shield).
• Properly dispose of biological waste.
• Clean work surfaces with disinfectant before and after use.
