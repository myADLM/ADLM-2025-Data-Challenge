Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase of Generating Results for CMV RESISTANCE:
GANCICLOVIR, FOSCARNET, CIDOFOVIR
1. PURPOSE
To ensure accurate detection and reporting of Cytomegalovirus
(CMV) resistance to the antiviral medications Ganciclovir, Foscarnet,
and Cidofovir.
Responsibility:
Designated staff are responsible for processing and analyzing CMV
resistance tests according to this procedure.
It is the responsibility of all personnel to report discrepancies and
issues encountered in the process to the supervisor immediately.
1. DEFINITION
CMV resistance testing identifies mutations in the viral genome
associated with reduced susceptibility to antiviral medications. This
process is critical for adjusting treatment regimens for patients
infected with CMV.
1. PROCEDURE
A) Specimen Requirements:
Preferred/acceptable:
• Plasma or serum samples collected in EDTA or heparinized tubes.
• 5 mL of whole blood sent to the laboratory within 24 hours of
collection.
Unacceptable:
• Clotted samples or samples collected in tubes containing
additives that may inhibit PCR reactions.
• Samples received beyond the stability period or the specified
collection date/time is not indicated.
B) Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies:
• PCR thermocycler
• DNA extraction kits (validated by the laboratory)
• Primers and probes specific for CMV resistance genes
• Sequencing apparatus or real-time PCR system
• Foscarnet, Ganciclovir, Cidofovir standard controls
• Necessary personal protective equipment
C) DNA Extraction:
1. Upon receipt, ensure the sample integrity. Samples should be
processed immediately for DNA extraction using validated
extraction kits.
2. Follow the manufacturer's protocol for DNA extraction. Ensure
that the sample ID is clearly labeled on the extraction tube.
3. Store extracted DNA at -20°C until further analysis.
D) PCR Amplification and Detection:
1. Prepare the PCR master mix including primers and probes
specific for CMV UL97 and UL54 genes related to resistance.
2. Add extracted DNA to the PCR master mix following
standardized protocols.
3. Run the PCR reaction using the thermocycler: initial
denaturation at 95°C for 2 minutes, followed by 35 cycles of
denaturation at 95°C for 15 seconds, annealing at 55°C for 30
seconds, and extension at 72°C for 1 minute.
4. Analyze the amplified products using gel electrophoresis or
real-time PCR analysis.
E) Sequencing:
1. For PCR products indicative of mutations, proceed with
sequencing:
◦ Prepare sequencing reactions using standard protocols.
◦ Load samples into the sequencing apparatus.
◦ Analyze sequence data to identify mutations.
F) Interpretation of Results:
1. Compare the identified mutations against established
databases of CMV resistance mutations.
2. Interpret the presence of mutations in UL97 and UL54 genes to
determine resistance to Ganciclovir, Foscarnet, and Cidofovir.
3. Document findings clearly, indicating mutations present and
respective resistance profiles.
G) Quality Control:
1. Include positive and negative controls in each run to ensure
assay performance.
2. Run internal quality control samples monthly and document
results.
3. Ensure equipment maintenance as per manufacturer
guidelines.
H) Reporting Results:
1. Results are reviewed and verified by designated technologists.
2. Report the presence or absence of resistance mutations based
on the sequencing data.
3. Use pre-defined comments and smart phrases to accompany
the results in the LIS.
Example: “Resistant mutation identified in UL97 gene indicative
of resistance to Ganciclovir.”
Reference Intervals: Not applicable.
Method Limitations: Refer to kit inserts or reagent documentation for
specific limitations.

Note: Regularly refer back to updated scientific literature and
database information to ensure up-to-date and accurate mutations
interpretation.
This SOP will be reviewed annually or as necessary upon updates to
methodologies or guidelines.
