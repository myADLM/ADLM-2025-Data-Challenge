Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for CNBP DNA Test (DM2)
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this SOP is to provide a detailed
procedure for the analytical phase of generating results for
CNBP DNA Test (DM2).
2. SCOPE This procedure applies to all personnel involved in the
DNA testing process for CNBP (DM2), including the
interpretation and reporting of results.
3. RESPONSIBILITY It is the responsibility of the designated
laboratory personnel to ensure the procedures outlined in this
SOP are followed to ensure accurate and reliable results.
4. MATERIALS AND REAGENTS
Reagents:
◦ PCR Master Mix
◦ CNBP (DM2) specific primers
◦ DNA extraction kit
◦ Nuclease-free water
◦ DNA ladder (for gel electrophoresis)
◦ Ethidium bromide or GelRed (for gel staining) or other
approved DNA staining reagents
◦ Loading dye
Equipment:
◦ Thermal cycler (PCR machine)
◦ Microcentrifuge
◦ Microcentrifuge tubes
◦ Pipettes and tips
◦ Electrophoresis unit and power supply
◦ Gel documentation system
◦ Laboratory Freezer and Refrigerator
◦ Vortex mixer
5. PROCEDURE
A. DNA Extraction:
1. Perform DNA extraction from the collected specimens
using the specified DNA extraction kit according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
2. Quantify DNA using a spectrophotometer or fluorometer
to ensure sufficient concentration and purity.
3. Store DNA samples at -20°C until ready for PCR.
B. PCR Amplification:
1. Prepare the PCR Master Mix according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Add the appropriate volume of DNA sample to each PCR
tube.
3. Add CNBP (DM2) specific primers to the tubes.
4. Set up the thermal cycler with the following cycling
conditions:
▪ Initial Denaturation: 95°C for 5 minutes
▪ Denaturation: 94°C for 30 seconds
▪ Annealing: 55°C for 30 seconds
▪ Extension: 72°C for 1 minute
▪ Number of Cycles: 35
▪ Final extension: 72°C for 10 minutes
▪ Hold: 4°C
5. Load the PCR tubes into the thermal cycler and start the
program.
C. Gel Electrophoresis:
1. Prepare a 1.5% agarose gel with ethidium bromide or
other approved DNA staining reagent.
2. Load DNA ladder and PCR products into wells of the gel.
3. Run the gel at a constant voltage (typically 100V) until the
dye front has migrated an appropriate distance.
4. Visualize the DNA bands using a gel documentation
system.
D. Interpretation of Results:
1. Compare the bands of the test samples to the DNA ladder
to determine the size of the PCR product.
2. A correct CNBP (DM2) amplification will result in a band of
the expected size, indicating the presence of the target
region.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Include positive and negative controls in each batch of PCR
to ensure the accuracy of the results.
◦ Validate the equipment performance by running regular
calibrations and maintenance.
◦ Document all steps, observations, and deviations in the
laboratory logbook.
7. REPORTING OF RESULTS
◦ Record the results in the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
◦ The results should include the size of the PCR product and
the interpretation of the findings.
◦ If necessary, a repeat of the assay should be performed for
confirmation.
◦ Ensure results are reviewed and verified by the assigned
laboratory personnel.
8. TROUBLESHOOTING Any issues encountered during the
procedure should be documented and reported to the
laboratory supervisor. Troubleshooting steps include:
◦ Verifying reagent quality and expiration dates.
◦ Checking the thermal cycler’s maintenance log.
◦ Ensuring proper gel preparation and electrophoresis
conditions.
9. REFERENCES
◦ Manufacturer’s instructions for the PCR Master Mix and
DNA extraction kit.
◦ Laboratory protocols and guidelines for DNA testing
procedures.
◦ Current literature on CNBP (DM2) molecular testing.
10. REVIEW AND REVISION This SOP should be reviewed
annually or as needed to reflect any changes in procedures or
regulatory requirements. Revisions should be documented and
approved by the laboratory supervisor.
