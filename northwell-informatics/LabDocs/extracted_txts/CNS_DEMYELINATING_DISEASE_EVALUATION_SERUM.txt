Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
CNS DEMYELINATING DISEASE EVALUATION, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedures for the analytical
phase of the CNS Demyelinating Disease Evaluation, Serum testing
in the laboratory. This includes the steps to be followed to ensure
accurate and reliable results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
All designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing
these procedures as specified and for maintaining the integrity and
accuracy of the testing process. It is the responsibility of the
laboratory supervisor to ensure compliance with this SOP and to
address any issues that arise.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Serum.
• Collection Tubes: Use a red-top tube or a serum separator tube
(SST).
• Volume: Minimum 1 mL of serum.
• Handling: Specimens must be allowed to clot completely before
centrifugation.
• Storage: Serum must be refrigerated at 2-8°C if not immediately
analyzed. If analysis is delayed more than 72 hours, the specimen
should be frozen at -20°C or colder.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Automated immunoassay analyzer or manual assay kit specific
for CNS demyelinating disease markers.
• Quality control materials (positive and negative control sera).
• Calibrators for the specific assay used.
• Appropriate micropipettes and tips.
• Centrifuge.
• Timer or stopwatch.
• Personal protective equipment (PPE).
• Documentation logs for temperature monitoring and quality
control.
5. PROCEDURE
A. PRE-ANALYTICAL PROCEDURES
1. Specimen Verification:
◦ Verify that the specimen is labeled correctly with the
patient's identification, date, and time of collection.
◦ Ensure that the specimen collection and handling
requirements are met.
2. Specimen Preparation:
◦ Centrifuge the blood collection tube at 1500-2000 x g for 10
minutes to separate the serum from the clot.
◦ Transfer the serum aliquot to a properly labeled secondary
tube if not already in a serum separator tube.
B. ANALYTICAL PROCEDURES
1. Instrument Preparation:
◦ Ensure that the immunoassay analyzer is calibrated
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Run quality control materials to verify instrument
performance. Record the results in the Quality Control Log.
◦ Ensure that all reagents are within expiration dates and
properly prepared (e.g., reconstituted, if necessary).
2. Assay Execution:
◦ Follow the assay-specific instructions provided in the
package insert. This typically involves the following:
▪ Pipetting a specified volume of serum into the reaction
well/cassette.
▪ Adding specific reagents or conjugates as outlined by
the kit manufacturer.
▪ Incubate the mixture for a specified time at the
appropriate temperature.
▪ Read the reaction using the immunoassay analyzer.
3. Result Interpretation:
◦ The instrument will generate quantitative or qualitative
results based on the presence of specific markers for CNS
demyelinating disease.
◦ Review the output and ensure that all quality control
parameters are within acceptable ranges before validating
patient results.
◦ If results are outside the expected performance criteria,
investigate the cause and re-run specimens as needed.
C. POST-ANALYTICAL PROCEDURES
1. Result Reporting:
◦ Results are automatically uploaded to the laboratory
information system (LIS) for review.
◦ Laboratory personnel are responsible for verifying and
validating the results before they are released.
◦ Notify the appropriate healthcare provider immediately if
critical values are obtained.
2. Quality Control:
◦ Document all quality control activities in the Quality Control
Log, including the lot numbers of reagents and calibrators,
and any corrective actions taken.
◦ Review quality control data regularly to identify any trends or
systematic issues.
3. Maintenance:
◦ Perform regular maintenance on the immunoassay analyzer
as required by the manufacturer.
◦ Clean and decontaminate work areas and equipment
according to laboratory protocols.
6. SAMPLE INTEGRITY
• Evaluate the clarity and appearance of the serum. Samples that
are grossly hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric may require an
additional comment on the test results as these conditions may
interfere with the assay.
7. CRITICAL VALUES AND LIMITATIONS
• Any critical or moderately abnormal results must be confirmed
and reported according to standard laboratory procedures.
• Reference intervals and interpretive criteria should be aligned with
the latest clinical guidelines and instrument/equipment
specifications.
8. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s operating manuals for the immunoassay analyzer
and specific CNS demyelinating disease evaluation kit.
• Clinical laboratory standards and guidelines for immunoassay
procedures.
• Relevant literature and clinical guidelines published to date for
CNS demyelinating disease evaluation.
9. DOCUMENTATION
• All testing, quality control, maintenance activities, and corrective
actions should be documented in a timely and accurate manner
following laboratory protocols.
• Ensure that temperature logs, equipment logs, and quality control
logs are maintained and reviewed regularly.
By adhering to this SOP, the laboratory ensures accurate and reliable
analysis of serum specimens for CNS demyelinating disease
evaluation, contributing to the appropriate diagnosis and monitoring
of patients.
