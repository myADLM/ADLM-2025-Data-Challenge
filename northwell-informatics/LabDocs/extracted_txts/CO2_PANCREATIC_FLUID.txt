SOP - Analytical Phase of Generating Results for CO2 in Pancreatic
Fluid
1. PURPOSE:
The following protocol outlines the step-by-step procedure to analyze
and generate results for CO2 in pancreatic fluid specimens. Accurate
measurement of CO2 in pancreatic fluid is essential for diagnostic
and monitoring purposes in patients with pancreatic disorders.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for
performing the analysis, generating results, and documenting the
process accurately following the outlined procedure.
1. DEFINITION:
Pancreatic fluid: The digestive fluid produced by the pancreas,
collected typically during endoscopic procedures for diagnostic
purposes.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY:
Preferred/Acceptable:
• Collect pancreatic fluid in a sterile, heparinized container.
• Ensure the specimen is free of air bubbles and promptly capped.
• Transport the specimen on ice or refrigerate immediately.
Unacceptable:
• Specimens not collected in a heparinized container.
• Specimens with air bubbles exceeding 10% of specimen volume.
• Clotted specimens and those not properly capped, resulting in
exposure to air.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES:
• Heparinized syringes or containers for collection.
• ABL 90 blood gas analyzer or equivalent blood gas analyzer.
• CO2 quality control material, properly stored and labeled.
• Ice, if immediate analysis is not possible.
• Personal protective equipment (PPE).
1. PROCEDURE:
A) Specimen Receiving:
• Ensure the specimen is properly labeled and stored.
• Verify that the specimen container is heparinized and free of air
bubbles.
• If the analysis is not performed immediately, store the specimen in
a refrigerator (2-8°C) and analyze within 2 hours of collection.
B) Sample Preparation:
• Mix the specimen gently by tilting the container to ensure
homogeneous distribution.
• Transfer the pancreatic fluid into a heparinized blood gas syringe,
avoiding the introduction of air.
• If necessary, use a metal "flea" and external magnet to mix the
fluid by moving the flea along the path of the syringe for 5
seconds.
C) Analyzer Setup:
• Ensure the blood gas analyzer (ABL 90) is calibrated and
functioning correctly.
• Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for preparing the analyzer
for use, including performing necessary quality control checks.
D) Analysis:
• Load the heparinized syringe into the analyzer.
• Initiate the analysis according to the manufacturer's protocol,
making sure the analyzer settings are configured for CO2
measurement.
• Monitor the analyzer for any error messages and ensure the
specimen is properly analyzed.
E) Documentation:
• Document the specimen ID, date, time of analysis, and initials of
the person performing the test.
• Verify and record the CO2 result in the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
F) Quality Control:
• Run quality control samples (low, normal, and high levels)
following set intervals to ensure analyzer accuracy.
• Document and review QC results. In case of QC failure,
troubleshoot and rerun the controls before analyzing patient
specimens.
1. REPORTING RESULTS:
• Results are automatically transmitted to the LIS.
• Technologists review and verify each CO2 result.
• Reported CO2 results must comply with site-specific reporting
guidelines.
• Highlight and document critical values and ensure follow-up as
per laboratory policy.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS:
Reference intervals for CO2 in pancreatic fluid should be established
based on the patient population and clinical relevance.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
• Ensure proper specimen collection and handling to avoid air
contamination, which could alter CO2 measurements.
• Refer to the blood gas analyzer's manual for specific limitations
concerning CO2 measurement.
1. ADDITIONAL NOTES:
• In the case of instrument unavailability or malfunction, ensure a
manual backup method is outlined according to the laboratory's
contingency plan.
• Maintain records of maintenance, calibration, and any
troubleshooting performed on the analyzer.

This protocol should be reviewed and approved by the Laboratory
Director and updated periodically or as new practices and equipment
are introduced.
