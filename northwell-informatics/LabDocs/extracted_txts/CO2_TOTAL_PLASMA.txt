Standard Operating Procedure for Analytical Phase of CO2,
Total, Plasma Measurement
1. PURPOSE
To establish and maintain a detailed protocol for measurement of
CO2, Total, Plasma ensuring accurate and reliable results for clinical
diagnosis and patient care.
Responsibility:
Trained laboratory personnel are responsible for performing the
procedure as outlined. It is the responsibility of all staff to ensure the
analytical phase is conducted rigorously and bring any issues to the
attention of a supervisor.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Acceptable Specimen Types:
• Plasma obtained from anticoagulated whole blood (use lithium
heparin, SST, or PST tubes).
Sample Volume:
• A minimum of 0.5 mL plasma is required for analysis.
Unacceptable Specimen Types:
• Specimens collected in tubes containing anticoagulants such as
sodium fluoride/oxalate, EDTA, or sodium citrate.
• Specimens with visible clots or hemolysis.
• Specimens received greater than 2 hours post-collection without
proper storage conditions (stored at 2-8°C if not analyzed
immediately).
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• CO2 analyzer or multi-chemistry analyzer capable of total CO2
measurement.
Reagents:
• Ensure reagents are within expiry date, stored according to
manufacturer’s instructions, and prepared as per guidelines
provided in the product insert.
Supplies:
• Calibrated pipettes
• Lithium heparin tubes, SST, PST
• Timer
• Lab coats and protective gear
1. PROCEDURE
Pre-Test Calibration:
1. Confirm proper calibration of the analyzer as per manufacturer's
instructions.
2. Perform any necessary calibration checks and document in
calibration log.
Specimen Preparation:
1. Place the plasma specimen in a properly labeled tube.
2. Ensure specimen is at room temperature for analysis.
3. Visually inspect the specimen for clots, hemolysis, or other
issues that could affect results.
Running the Test:
1. Load the plasma sample into the analyzer following the
manufacturer’s guidelines.
2. Initiate the test run on the analyzer, ensuring correct selection
of the CO2, Total, Plasma test mode.
3. Monitor the analyzer for any error messages or calibration
issues during the run.
Post-Test Protocol:
1. Once the test is complete, verify the results on the analyzer
display.
2. Print out the results or ensure that they are documented in the
laboratory information system (LIS).
3. Review the results for any flags or messages that indicate
potential issues. If any flags are present, troubleshoot as per
manufacturer’s instructions.
4. Perform a quick centrifuge check if sample integrity is
questionable.
Criteria for acceptance: Refer to quality control data and determine
if the result falls within established acceptable limits.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
2. Ensure the analyzer’s internal quality control runs are within
acceptable limits before every patient sample run.
3. QC material should be tested at designated times, and results
documented in the quality control log.
4. Any deviations or failures in quality control must be addressed
immediately, and necessary corrective actions documented.
QC Frequency:
• Daily: Perform two levels of QC checks (high and low).
• Weekly: Full QC panel review, including linearity, sensitivity, and
precision checks.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
Results must be reviewed and verified by a qualified technologist.
Any critical values must be reported to the relevant clinician or
attending healthcare provider immediately.
Reference Intervals:
• Total CO2 (Plasma): 22-29 mmol/L
1. RESULT REVIEW AND DOCUMENTATION
Verification of results involves checking against historical data, QC
findings, and ensuring all entries are accurate in the LIS.
1. REFERENCES
Refer to the analyzer's user manual, manufacturer's insert, and
common clinical chemistry references for detailed troubleshooting
and guidance.
1. REVISION HISTORY
Document any procedural changes, updates, or amendments in the
revision log. Ensure all changes are communicated to staff and
appropriate training is provided.
This SOP aims to standardize the measurement process for CO2,
Total, Plasma, ensuring consistency, reliability, and clinical relevance
of results. Adherence to this protocol is mandatory for all staff
involved in the analytical phase of processing plasma CO2 tests.
