STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE
COAGULATION FACTOR II ACTIVITY ASSAY, PLASMA
1. PURPOSE
To accurately determine the Factor II (Prothrombin) activity
levels in plasma samples to aid in diagnosing and monitoring
coagulation disorders.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
Qualified laboratory staff with specific training in coagulation
assay techniques are responsible for performing the
Coagulation Factor II Activity Assay, ensuring accuracy,
reproducibility, and proper documentation of results.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
◦ Preferred Specimens: Citrated plasma collected in 3.2%
sodium citrate tubes. The ratio of blood to anticoagulant
must be 9:1.
◦ Collection: Ensure the first few milliliters of blood, which may
contain tissue factors, are discarded.
◦ Unacceptable Specimens: Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric
samples, improperly filled tubes, clotted samples.
◦ Handling: Centrifuge the sample at 1500 x g for 15 minutes
at room temperature within 1 hour of collection. Aliquot
plasma to a clean plastic tube and freeze at -20°C or lower if
not tested immediately. Samples are stable for up to 2
weeks at -20°C and longer at -70°C. Avoid freeze-thaw
cycles.
4. EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS
◦ Coagulation analyzer (e.g., Siemens BCS XP, Sysmex
CS-2500)
◦ Reagents: Factor II-deficient plasma (commercially
prepared), activator reagents (e.g., thromboplastin), control
plasmas (Normal and Abnormal)
◦ Calibrated pipettes and tips
◦ Centrifuge with temperature control
◦ Water bath or heating block set at 37°C
5. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation
◦ Thaw test plasma and control plasma at 37°C for 3-5
minutes if needed. Ensure complete thawing and gentle
mixing to avoid bubbles.
◦ Prepare all reagents as per the manufacturer’s instructions;
allow thawed reagents to equilibrate to room temperature
before use.
B) System Setup for Coagulation Analyzer
◦ Turn on the coagulation analyzer and perform a startup
procedure according to the operator’s manual.
◦ Ensure the instrument is calibrated using the appropriate
calibration standards provided by the manufacturer.
◦ Run quality control (QC) materials at two levels (normal and
abnormal) before beginning patient sample analysis. Ensure
QC results fall within acceptable ranges.
C) Assay Procedure
◦ Dilute patient plasma sample and control plasma in factor II-
deficient plasma at a 1:10 ratio (1 part plasma to 9 parts
deficient plasma).
◦ Pipette the diluted plasma into the pre-designated positions
on the coagulation analyzer.
◦ Add the activator reagent (e.g., thromboplastin) to the
samples.
◦ The instrument will automatically measure the clotting time
for each sample.
◦ The analyzer’s software will calculate the Factor II activity by
comparing the clotting time of the patient’s plasma to a
standard curve generated using calibrators.
6. CALCULATION AND INTERPRETATION
◦ Plasma factor II activity is reported as a percentage of
normal activity. Reference ranges will be provided by the
manufacturer but typically range from 70-120%.
◦ Abnormal results may indicate conditions such as hereditary
factor II deficiency, vitamin K deficiency, liver disease, or the
presence of anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin therapy).
7. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Monitor the assay’s performance by running QC samples
with each batch of tests and post-calibration. Document all
QC results.
◦ Investigate and resolve any QC failures or trending patterns
that do not meet acceptable criteria.
◦ Participate in external proficiency testing programs and
analyze the results to ensure interlaboratory consistency.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ Results for Factor II activity are transmitted directly to the
LIS (Laboratory Information System) by the analyzer.
◦ Review and verify results before releasing them in the LIS,
ensuring all QC criteria have been met.
◦ For critically low levels (< 20% activity), follow the
laboratory’s protocol for critical results notification to the
requesting physician.
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
◦ Hemolyzed samples may release tissue factors that can
interfere with the assay.
◦ Improper sample handling and storage conditions may affect
the test results.
◦ Certain conditions, such as liver disease and the use of
anticoagulants, may affect Factor II levels and should be
considered during interpretation.
