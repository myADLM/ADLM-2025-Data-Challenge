Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Analytical Phase of Generating
Results for Coagulation Factor IX Activity Assay, Plasma
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this SOP is to outline the
procedures for the analytical phase of generating results for the
Coagulation Factor IX Activity (FIX) Assay in plasma. These
procedures ensure accurate, reliable, and reproducible results
through standardized methods and proper quality control
practices.
Responsibility: All laboratory personnel performing the FIX Assay are
responsible for adhering to this SOP. Supervisors are responsible for
ensuring staff compliance and addressing any deficiencies or
deviations from this protocol.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Acceptable Specimen: Citrated plasma collected in a sodium
citrate tube (blue top). The specimen should be centrifuged to
obtain platelet-poor plasma and stored at 2-8°C if not analyzed
immediately. For delayed analysis, samples should be frozen at
-20°C or lower.
• Unacceptable Specimen: Samples with hemolysis, clots, or
improper anticoagulants (e.g., EDTA or heparin).
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Coagulation Analyzer: Calibrated appropriately and validated for
FIX activity assays.
• FIX Calibrator and Control Plasma: Commercially available
certified standard.
• Thromboplastin Reagent: Containing specific activators for FIX.
• Buffer Solutions: As required by the assay protocol.
• Pipettes: Calibrated for accurate sample and reagent
dispensation.
• Test Tubes: For assay performance.
• Timer: For precise incubation and reaction timing.
• Temperature Monitoring: Ensuring all equipment is within
specified tolerance limits.
1. PROCEDURE A) Pre-Analytical Preparation:
◦ Verify and log the sample arrival time and condition.
◦ Centrifuge the citrated plasma specimens at 1,500 x g for 15
minutes to obtain platelet-poor plasma.
◦ Aliquot the plasma in labeled tubes, following laboratory
protocol, and store appropriately at 2-8°C or freeze if
necessary.
B) FIX Assay Preparation:
• Warm the reagents to room temperature prior to use.
• Prepare assay calibrators, controls, and samples according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
• Calibrate the analyzer using the FIX reference plasma.
C) Testing Process:
• Load the plasma samples, controls, and calibrators into the
analyzer.
• Add thromboplastin reagent to each tube as per protocol.
• Follow the specific reaction incubation-time standards for FIX
activity determination.
• Measure the clotting time and record results.
D) Data Recording and Validation:
• Review analyzer generated data for completeness and accuracy.
• Validate the results by checking control and calibrator outcomes.
• Document all results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run quality control assays for each batch of tests to verify assay
performance.
• Utilize positive and negative controls, ensuring within expected
control range before reporting patient results.
• Monthly inter-laboratory proficiency testing for FIX activity assays
is to be performed to ensure assay consistency and reliability.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Review results for accuracy and completeness.
• Results that are outside of the reference ranges are to be flagged
and reviewed by a supervisor.
• Document critical values following the laboratory's critical value
reporting policy and ensure immediate notification to the
appropriate healthcare provider.
• Report validated results to the LIS.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer instructions for FIX assay kit.
• Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines for
coagulation testing.
• Internal laboratory QA/QC policies.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS Refer to the specific assay kit
instructions for limitations regarding sample integrity, reagent
stability, and any factors affecting the assay's accuracy.
2. CORRECTIVE ACTIONS If quality control results are out of
range, repeat the test with new reagents. If patient results are
inconsistent, reanalyze a fresh aliquot or provide the sample for
supervisor review. Document all corrective actions taken.
3. DOCUMENTATION Maintain all records of calibration, control
measures, patient results, and any corrective actions. Store
documents following laboratory policy for record retention.
This SOP is to be reviewed annually and updated as necessary to
reflect changes in methodology, equipment, or regulatory
requirements.
