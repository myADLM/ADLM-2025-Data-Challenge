Standard Operating Procedures: COAGULATION FACTOR VIII
ACTIVITY ASSAY, PLASMA
1. PURPOSE
To accurately measure the activity of Factor VIII in plasma to assist in
diagnosis and management of hemophilia A and other related
disorders.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for correctly
performing the Factor VIII activity assay, documenting results, and
ensuring all procedures are followed accurately.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Acceptable Specimens:
• Platelet-poor plasma collected in sodium citrate (light blue-stopper
tube)
• Specimen must be processed within 4 hours of collection or, if
frozen, must be maintained at -70°C or below
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens collected in other anticoagulants (e.g., heparin, EDTA)
• Specimens that have been hemolyzed
• Specimens that were not centrifuged and separated promptly
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Coagulation analyzer (e.g., Sysmex CA-1500)
• Micro-pipettes and tips
• Centrifuge capable of achieving 1500 x g
Reagents:
• Calcium chloride solution
• Factor VIII deficient plasma
• Factor VIII standards/calibrators
• Automated aPTT reagent (appropriate to analyzer model)
• Control plasmas, negative and positive, as per site-specific
guidelines
Supplies:
• Sodium citrate tubes
• 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes
• Disposable gloves
• Biohazard disposal containers
1. PROCEDURE
Preparation: A. Verify specimen requirement compliance. Centrifuge
plasma samples promptly at 1500 x g for 15 minutes to separate
platelets and yield platelet-poor plasma. B. Prepare reagents and
calibrators following manufacturer’s instructions.
Assay Setup:
1. Load plasma samples, calibrators, and control plasmas into the
coagulation analyzer.
2. Load automated aPTT reagent and calcium chloride solution
into the appropriate reagent ports.
3. Program the assay according to analyzer software settings for
Factor VIII activity measurement.
Assay Execution: A. Ensure the analyzer performs internal
calibrations. B. Run negative and positive control plasmas to ensure
assay accuracy. C. Proceed with plasma sample analysis, ensuring
each well has the appropriate reagents as per manufacturer’s
protocol.
Troubleshooting:
1. If control plasmas fall outside acceptable ranges:
◦ Re-run the controls.
◦ Check reagent preparation and analyzer maintenance
protocols.
◦ Contact designated supervisor if issues persist.
2. QUALITY CONTROL
Internal QC:
• Run control samples with each batch of patient specimens.
• Document control results in QC log.
• Validate control ranges periodically, adjusting according to internal
validation procedures.
External QC:
• Participate in proficiency testing as per lab QC guidelines.
• Compare results periodically against external controls to ensure
inter-lab consistency.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
A. Factor VIII activity results are automatically transmitted to the
Laboratory Information System (LIS). B. Review and verify results
before releasing to clinicians, ensuring accuracy of reported units and
values. C. Critical results requiring immediate attention are flagged
and informed to the requesting physician following the established
protocol.
Reference Intervals:
• Normal Factor VIII activity: 50-150% of standard activity
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
A. Hemolysis, lipemia, and icterus may interfere with assay results.
B. Ensure plasma is platelet-poor to avoid false-low results.

protocols
1. REAGENT AND EQUIPMENT VALIDATION
A. On receiving new reagent lots or equipment, perform validation by
running known standard and control samples. B. Document all results
and compare against existing validated parameters.
1. DOCUMENTATION
A. Maintain assay logs including date, time, technologist initials,
specimen ID, and reagent lot numbers. B. Ensure all corrective
actions and troubleshooting steps are documented in the respective
logs.
1. REVISIONS
Reviewed and Updated: October 2023
By following these procedures, accuracy, reliability, and
reproducibility in the measurement of Factor VIII activity in plasma
can be ensured, adhering to high standards required in a CLIA-
certified laboratory.
