Standard Operating Procedure
COAGULATION FACTOR VIII INHIBITOR SCREEN, PLASMA
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the detection of Factor
VIII inhibitors in patient plasma, ensuring accurate and reliable
results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
• Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing
the Factor VIII inhibitor screen and ensuring the integrity of the
process.
• The laboratory supervisor is responsible for monitoring
compliance with this SOP and for addressing any deviations from
the protocol.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
◦ Specimen type: Citrated plasma (3.2% sodium citrate).
◦ Collection: Collect whole blood in a blue-top sodium citrate
tube.
◦ Specimen handling: Centrifuge at 1500 x g for 15 minutes
to obtain platelet-poor plasma. Aliquot plasma into labelled
plastic tubes and freeze at -20°C or lower within 4 hours of
collection. If immediate testing is not possible, store at
-70°C.
◦ Unacceptable specimens: Grossly hemolyzed, icteric, or
lipemic specimens.
2. REAGENTS AND EQUIPMENT
◦ Factor VIII Deficient Plasma
◦ Imidazole buffer or a phospholipid reagent in buffer
◦ Normal Pooled Plasma (NPP)
◦ Calibrated micropipettes
◦ Timer
◦ Water bath set at 37°C
◦ Controls: Positive and negative controls for Factor VIII
inhibitors
◦ Clot detection analyzer
3. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation
1. Thaw frozen specimens and reagents at 37°C using a
water bath. Ensure that the water does not contact the
tube caps or labels.
2. Allow reagents and controls to equilibrate to room
temperature before use.
B. Mixing Procedure
1. Mixing Patient Plasma and Normal Pooled Plasma
a. Label tubes for patient plasma (1:1) mix and controls.
b. Add 100 µL of patient plasma to 100 µL of Normal
Pooled Plasma in a labelled tube. c. Prepare positive and
negative controls similarly: add 100 µL of control plasma
to 100 µL of Normal Pooled Plasma.
C. Incubation
1. Incubate all tubes in a 37°C water bath for 2 hours.
2. Remove mixtures and allow to cool at room temperature
for 5 minutes.
D. Factor VIII Activity Assay
1. Perform a Factor VIII assay on the mixture using the clot
detection analyzer.
2. Pipette appropriate reagent volumes and follow the
manufacturer’s instructions for the analyzer.
3. Multiply results by the dilution factor to determine final
Factor VIII activity if necessary.
E. Calculation and Interpretation
1. Calculate the Residual Factor VIII Activity:
▪ Define “mix” activity as ( \left( \frac{FVIII \ in \ patient's \
plasma \ aliquot}{FVIII \ in \ Negative \ Control} \right)
\times 100 ).
2. Interpret Results:
▪ Inhibitor Present: Residual Factor VIII activity <50%.
▪ No Inhibitor: Residual Factor VIII activity ≥50%.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Run positive and negative controls with each batch of
patient samples.
◦ Verify the performance of the clot detection analyzer with
each test run.
◦ Investigate any control failure and take corrective actions
before reporting patient results.
5. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ Document all control and patient results in the laboratory
information system (LIS).
◦ Report findings clearly, stating the presence or absence of
Factor VIII inhibitors and the calculated Factor VIII activity.
◦ Include any relevant comments (e.g., hemolysis, lipemia)
that might affect the interpretation of results.
6. REFERENCE RANGES
◦ Normal individuals typically have no detectable inhibitors
(<0.5 Bethesda Units).
◦ Clinical correlation with patient history and symptoms is
necessary for interpretation of results.
7. LIMITATIONS
◦ Hemolysis, icterus, and lipemia can interfere with results.
◦ False positives can occur in cases of high fibrinogen levels
or technical errors during plasma mixing and incubation.
◦ Pre-analytical variables such as incorrect blood collection,
improper storage, or handling can affect results.

inhibitor testing.
