COAGULATION FACTOR VII ACTIVITY ASSAY, PLASMA -
Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
1. PURPOSE
To establish a standardized protocol for the analysis and reporting of
coagulation Factor VII activity in plasma samples. This SOP ensures
accuracy, consistency, and reliability of the test results.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel performing the
coagulation Factor VII activity assay in a CLIA-certified laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Laboratory Technologists: Perform the assay according to this
SOP.
• Supervisors: Ensure compliance with the SOP and resolve any
issues arising during the assay.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Plasma
• Collection Container: Sodium citrate (light blue-top) tubes
• Specimen Volume: Minimum of 2 mL of plasma
• Specimen Stability:
◦ Room temperature: ≤ 4 hours
◦ Refrigerated (2-8°C): ≤ 24 hours
◦ Frozen: ≤ 6 months at -20°C
5. REAGENTS AND EQUIPMENT
• Factor VII deficient plasma
• Phospholipid reagent
• Calcium chloride solution
• Buffer solution
• Clotting time measuring instrument (e.g., coagulation analyzer)
• Timer
• Pipettes and tips
• Calibrated control plasmas (normal and pathological)
6. PROCEDURE
6.1. Preparation of Reagents
1. Reconstitute all reagents according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
2. Prepare the Factor VII activity calibration curve using known
standards.
6.2. Sample Preparation and Handling
1. Centrifuge the sodium citrate plasma tubes at 1500 g for 15
minutes to obtain platelet-poor plasma.
2. Aliquot the plasma into labeled tubes and store at -20°C if not
analyzed immediately.
3. Thaw plasma samples at 37°C just before analysis and bring to
room temperature.
6.3. Assay Procedure
1. Set up the coagulation analyzer and verify its calibration.
2. Prepare the assay mix in the reaction cuvettes:
◦ 100 µL of patient plasma
◦ 100 µL of Factor VII deficient plasma
◦ 50 µL of phospholipid reagent
◦ 50 µL of calcium chloride solution
3. Incubate the mixture at 37°C for exactly 3 minutes.
4. Initiate the clotting reaction by adding calcium chloride solution
and start the timer immediately.
5. Measure the clotting time until a clot is detected.
6. Compare the clotting time of the sample to the calibration curve
to calculate the Factor VII activity.
6.4. Quality Control
1. Run quality control samples (normal and pathological control
plasmas) at the beginning of each run, after every 20 patient
samples, and at the end of each run.
2. Document the results in the Quality Control Log.
3. If any control results fall outside the acceptable range,
investigate and resolve the issue before proceeding with patient
samples.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Calculate the Factor VII activity based on the clotting time and
the calibration curve.
2. Enter the results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
3. Review and verify the results before releasing them.
Reference Intervals:
• Normal range: 50-150%
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolysis, lipemia, and icterus may interfere with the assay.
• Proper storage and timely analysis of specimens are crucial for
accurate results.
• Ensure all reagents are within their expiry date and properly
stored.
9. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If controls are out of range, check for reagent expiry, instrument
calibration, and proper sample handling.
• If clotting time is excessively prolonged, verify the integrity of the
Factor VII deficient plasma and other reagents.
10. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s Instructions for Use (IFU) for reagents and
coagulation analyzer.
• Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines for
coagulation testing.
11. RECORD CONTROL
• Maintain records of reagent lot numbers, expiration dates, and
calibration data.
• Document all QC results and any corrective actions taken in the
QC Log.
