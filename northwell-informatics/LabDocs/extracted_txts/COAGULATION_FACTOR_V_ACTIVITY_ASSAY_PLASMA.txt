Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Coagulation Factor V
Activity Assay, Plasma
1. PURPOSE
To define the procedures for the analytical phase of generating
results for Coagulation Factor V Activity Assay in plasma to ensure
accurate, reliable, and timely results for patient diagnosis and
management.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
Laboratory technologists are responsible for performing the assay
according to this SOP. It is the responsibility of the supervisor to
ensure that the technologists are trained and that procedures are
accurately followed and documented.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred Specimen:
• 3-5 mL of plasma collected using a laboratory-approved method,
such as venipuncture, in an anticoagulant tube (usually 3.2%
sodium citrate).
• Specimens must be centrifuged within 30 minutes of collection to
separate plasma.
• Collected plasma should be frozen at -20°C or colder if testing is
delayed.
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Specimens not properly labeled with collection date and time.
• Specimens that have hemolysis or clots.
• Plasma that has been stored at room temperature for over 2
hours or inadequately refrigerated.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Centrifuge
• Coagulation analyzer (e.g., Sysmex CS-2500)
• Calibrators for Factor V activity
• Quality control materials
• Pipettes and tips
• Sodium citrate tubes
• Freezer and refrigerator
• Timer
5. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation
1. Gather all necessary equipment and reagents.
2. Verify the plasma samples are correctly labeled and recorded.
3. Ensure samples are properly stored and check for any signs of
hemolysis or clots.
4. Set up the coagulation analyzer and ensure it is calibrated as
per manufacturer guidelines.
B. Assay Steps
1. Standard Preparation: Prepare calibrators and controls as per
manufacturer's instructions. Refer to the specific lot calibration
certificates and ensure they are registered.
2. Sample Processing: Thaw frozen samples at room
temperature. If sediment is present, mix samples gently but
thoroughly.
3. Dilution: Dilute the plasma samples following the
manufacturer's guidelines for the Factor V Activity Assay.
4. Loading Samples: Load the reagents, calibrators, controls,
and patient samples onto the coagulation analyzer.
5. Running Assay: Initiate the Factor V Activity Assay procedure
following the analyzer's software prompt. Set appropriate
parameters as listed in the calibration documents.
6. Monitor Assay: Ensure the analyzer is functioning optimally,
checking for alerts or errors during the run.
7. Quality Control Checks: Perform internal quality control
checks on known positive and negative controls. Document any
deviations and corrective actions taken.
8. Completion: Collect and print the results once the run is
complete.
C. Data Analysis
1. Review the results generated by the coagulation analyzer for
consistency and accuracy.
2. Verify the quality control results are within acceptable ranges.
3. Compile and analyze data maintaining strict adherence to
predefined reference intervals.
4. Identify and flag any results that fall outside normal ranges for
further investigation.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Verify results against control methods.
2. Document the results in the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
3. Ensure critical values are promptly communicated to the
requesting physician as per laboratory protocol.
4. Confirm and sign off the assay results after review by the
supervising technologist.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run controls before patient samples at the start of each working
day.
• Perform bi-weekly proficiency testing and monthly comparisons
with peer laboratories.
• Ensure calibration certificates and results logs are maintained and
up to date.
8. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's instructions and package inserts for specific
reagents and calibrators.
• Laboratory SOP Manual for Internal Quality Control Management.
• Relevant scientific literature and guidelines on Factor V Activity
Assay.
9. NOTES
• Ensure strict adherence to procedural guidelines to avoid
contamination, erroneous results, and ensure reproducibility.
• Document any anomalies or deviations from SOP along with
corrective actions taken.
10. REVISION HISTORY
• Maintain a log of revisions to SOP and ensure all technologists
receive updates to procedures.
By adhering strictly to this SOP, the laboratory ensures the
generation of high-quality, accurate results for the Coagulation Factor
V Activity Assay in plasma, contributing to reliable patient testing and
diagnosis.
