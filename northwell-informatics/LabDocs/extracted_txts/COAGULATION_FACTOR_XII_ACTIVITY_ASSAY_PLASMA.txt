COAGULATION FACTOR XII ACTIVITY ASSAY, PLASMA
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the determination of
Coagulation Factor XII activity in plasma samples using a
chromogenic substrate assay.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for
performing this assay and ensuring that all results are accurate and
documented according to this SOP. It is the responsibility of staff and
supervisors to ensure all steps are followed, including recording of
quality control results and any corrective actions required.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/acceptable:
• Citrated plasma: Blood collected in sodium citrate tubes (light blue
top).
• Plasma should be separated from cells within one hour of
collection and frozen at -20°C or lower if not tested immediately.
Unacceptable:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric plasma samples.
• Specimens collected in anticoagulants other than sodium citrate.
• Samples not properly labeled or transported.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
Equipment:
• Centrifuge capable of 2500 x g
• Freezer (-20°C or lower)
• Plate reader with chromogenic substrate detection capability
• Pipettes and micropipettes
• Vortex mixer
Reagents:
• Coagulation Factor XII chromogenic substrate kit
• Calibration plasma with known Coagulation Factor XII activity
• Quality control plasma: Negative and positive controls
• Assay buffer as provided in the kit
• Citrated plasma samples
1. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation:
1. Centrifuge blood collection tubes at 2500 x g for 15 minutes at
room temperature.
2. Carefully transfer the plasma to a labeled plastic tube without
disturbing the buffy coat.
3. Freeze plasma at -20°C or lower if not tested immediately.
Thaw samples at room temperature prior to assay.
B. Calibration and Quality Control:
1. Prepare calibration standards according to the kit instructions.
2. Run negative and positive controls with each assay batch.
3. Document calibration and control results to ensure assay
validity.
C. Assay Execution:
1. Allow reagents and samples to reach room temperature.
2. Prepare substrate and assay buffer as specified in the kit
instructions.
3. Pipette appropriate volumes of plasma samples, calibration
standards, and controls into wells of the microplate.
4. Add substrate solution to each well.
5. Incubate the plate at room temperature for recommended time
duration (typically 10-15 minutes).
6. Measure absorbance at the specified wavelength using the
plate reader.
7. Calculate Coagulation Factor XII activity based on the standard
curve generated from calibration standards.
D. Data Analysis and Reporting:
1. Review the standard curve and ensure its validity.
2. Calculate the Coagulation Factor XII activity for each sample
using the curve.
3. Document results in the LIS.
4. Verify results and ensure any critical values are reported
according to lab policy.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
A. Material: Negative and positive control plasma provided in QC kits
should be used. Store QC material at 2-8°C or as specified by the
manufacturer.
B. Procedure: Run QC samples with each assay batch. Verify control
results against established ranges. Document any deviations and
corrective actions taken.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples can interfere with assay
results and should be avoided.
• Use of anticoagulants other than sodium citrate can lead to
inaccurate results.
• Accurate pipetting and strict adherence to incubation times are
crucial for reliable results.

1. REPORTING RESULTS
Refer to site-specific reporting guidelines.
Critical Results: Critical results should be reported immediately
according to institutional policies.
Sample Integrity: If sample integrity is in question due to hemolysis,
lipemia, or icterus, consider repeating the assay or requesting a new
sample.
By following this SOP, laboratory personnel will consistently generate
accurate and reliable Coagulation Factor XII activity results for
plasma samples.
