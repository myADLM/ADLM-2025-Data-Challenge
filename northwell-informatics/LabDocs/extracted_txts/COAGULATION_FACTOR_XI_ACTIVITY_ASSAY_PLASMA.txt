Coagulation Factor XI Activity Assay Standard Operating
Procedure (SOP)
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this SOP is to provide a detailed
procedure for the analysis of plasma specimens to determine the
activity of Coagulation Factor XI using a clot-based assay. This assay
is critical for diagnosing Factor XI deficiency and other associated
coagulation disorders.
2. RESPONSIBILITY This procedure is to be performed by trained
laboratory personnel proficient in coagulation testing. It is the
responsibility of the laboratory staff to follow this procedure strictly
and document all necessary details accurately.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/Acceptable
• Specimen type: Citrated plasma (3.2% sodium citrate)
• Preferred volume: 1 mL
• Collection: Blood should be collected in a blue-top (sodium
citrate) tube. The ratio of blood to anticoagulant should be
maintained at 9:1.
• Processing: Plasma must be double-centrifuged to ensure
platelet-poor plasma prior to analysis.
Unacceptable Specimens
• Specimens that are lipemic or hemolyzed.
• Specimens that have been standing at room temperature for more
than 4 hours prior to processing.
• Incompletely filled tubes.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Coagulometer (automated or semi-automated)
• Factor XI-deficient plasma
• Activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) reagent
• Calcium chloride solution (0.025 M)
• Normal control plasma
• Abnormal control plasma
• Pipettes (variable volume)
• Centrifuge
• Timer
• Calibration curves or a standard reference plasma preparation
5. PROCEDURE
a. Plasma Preparation
1. Centrifuge the citrated blood samples at 1,500 x g for 15
minutes at room temperature.
2. Carefully transfer the supernatant (plasma) to a new tube
without disturbing the cells.
3. Repeat centrifugation at 1,500 x g for another 15 minutes to
achieve platelet-poor plasma.
4. Aliquot plasma into appropriately labeled tubes for immediate
testing or storage at -70°C if not analyzed within 4 hours.
b. Assay Preparation
1. Set up and calibrate the coagulometer according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Prepare the calibration curve using standard reference plasma
preparations.
3. Thaw any frozen samples and reagents rapidly at 37°C, and
gently mix before use.
c. Assay Procedure
1. In a reaction cuvette, mix 50 µL of patient plasma with 50 µL of
Factor XI-deficient plasma.
2. Add 100 µL of prewarmed APTT reagent. Incubate the mixture
at 37°C for a specified time (usually 3-5 minutes).
3. Rapidly add 100 µL of prewarmed calcium chloride solution to
initiate clotting.
4. Record the clotting time.
5. Perform the assay concurrently with normal and abnormal
control plasmas to ensure assay validity.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run normal and abnormal control plasmas with each batch of
patient tests.
• Ensure the controls fall within the established acceptable ranges
before reporting patient results.
• If controls are out of range, troubleshoot the assay and repeat
until acceptable control results are obtained.
7. CALCULATIONS
1. Plot the clotting times of calibration standards on a graph
against their known Factor XI activity to generate a standard
curve.
2. Determine the Factor XI activity in patient samples by referring
to the standard curve using their clotting times.
3. Express results as a percentage (%) of normal activity.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results should be reported in percentage (%) activity.
• Reference range: 70-150%
• Include appropriate comments in case of borderline or abnormal
results.
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolysis, lipemia, or high levels of bilirubin can interfere with
results.
• Anticoagulant treatment can affect results.
• Factor XI activity levels can vary with reagent sensitivity and
different assay methods.
10. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions and reagent package inserts for
detailed information on APTT reagent and Factor XI-deficient
plasma.
• Clinical Hematology principles and instrumental technique
references for clot-based assays.
11. DOCUMENTATION
• Daily and periodic maintenance logs for the coagulometer
• Temperature logs for specimen storage equipment
• Quality control results logs
