Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for COAGULATION FACTOR
X ACTIVITY ASSAY, PLASMA
1. PURPOSE
To establish a standardized procedure for the determination of
Coagulation Factor X activity in plasma. This assay is essential for
the diagnosis and monitoring of patients with Factor X deficiency or
other related coagulopathies.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory personnel to
perform, document, and ensure the accuracy and precision of the
Factor X activity assay according to this SOP. Supervisors are
responsible for ensuring that the staff are adequately trained and that
the procedure is followed correctly.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type:
• Preferable: Freshly collected, double-spun platelet-poor plasma.
• Collection tubes: 3.2% sodium citrate (light blue-top tubes).
Specimen Handling:
• Properly mix the plasma with the anticoagulant by gentle
inversion.
• Centrifuge the specimen at 1500x g for 15 minutes at room
temperature.
• Transfer the plasma to a plastic transport tube, avoiding the buffy
coat and cellular components.
• Centrifuge again at 1500x g for another 15 minutes.
• Aliquot the plasma into labeled tubes.
• Store plasma at -70°C or lower if not tested within 4 hours.
• Thaw rapidly at 37°C in a water bath, mix gently, then test
immediately.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Clotted samples.
• Hemolyzed samples.
• Samples not properly anticoagulated.
• Samples that have undergone repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
1. REAGENTS, EQUIPMENT, AND SUPPLIES
Reagents:
• Factor X deficient plasma (commercially available).
• Tris-buffered saline (TBS).
• Factor X calibrators and controls.
• Chromogenic or clot-based assay substrates.
Equipment:
• Coagulation analyzer/calibrated spectrophotometer.
• Centrifuge.
• Pipettes and tips.
• Water bath set at 37°C.
• Stopwatches or timers.
Supplies:
• Plastic test tubes or wells.
• Sample cups or tubes.
• Gloves, lab coat, and other personal protective equipment (PPE).
1. QUALITY CONTROL
Quality Control Material:
• Utilize at least two levels of commercial plasma controls (normal
and abnormal).
• QC materials are to be treated the same as patient specimens.
Procedure:
• Perform quality control tests at the beginning of each shift or
assay run.
• Record QC results in the QC log. Out-of-range controls must be
investigated and resolved before testing patient samples.
• Document corrective actions taken for out-of-range QC.
1. PROCEDURE
Pre-Analytical Phase:
1. Verify the specimen requisition form and ensure patient
identification.
2. Check the specimen for appropriate labeling and condition.
3. Allow refrigerated or frozen specimens to equilibrate to room
temperature.
Analytical Phase:
1. Prepare the working reagent mix according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
2. Set up the coagulation analyzer or spectrophotometer with
appropriate assay parameters.
3. Perform instrument calibration and verification as required.
4. Pipette a specific volume of Factor X deficient plasma into a
plastic test tube or well.
5. Add the same volume of patient or control plasma.
6. Incubate the mixture at 37°C for 2-3 minutes.
7. Add the chromogenic substrate or reagent mix as per the assay
protocol.
8. Measure the change in optical density at the specified
wavelength or determine clotting time.
9. Record the test results and calculate Factor X activity using the
calibration curve.
Post-Analytical Phase:
1. Review and compare test results against the reference intervals
and quality control data.
2. Verify the results and enter them into the laboratory information
system (LIS).
3. If critical values are detected, refer to the laboratory’s critical
value policy for prompt notification of the healthcare provider.
4. REPORTING RESULTS
Reference Intervals:
• Factor X activity: 70-150% (adult reference range; adjust as
necessary for pediatric populations).
Result Reporting:
• Provide patient results as a percentage of normal activity.
• Include any interpretive comments or flags as appropriate based
on the QC data.
• Flag any results that fall below or above critical values with "LOW"
or "HIGH" respectively.
1. ACTIONS FOR OUT-OF-RANGE QC OR TEST RESULTS
• Reassay the sample to confirm the out-of-range result.
• Check reagents, instrument calibration, and QC data.
• Perform instrument maintenance if necessary.
• Document all actions and resolution in the QC log.
1. LIMITATIONS
• Hemolysis, lipemia, or icterus may interfere with the assay results.
• Improper specimen handling can affect the accuracy of the test
results.
• High circulating levels of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) can
interfere with the assay.
