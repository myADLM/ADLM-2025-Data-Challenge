1. PURPOSE
To provide a detailed step-by-step procedure for analyzing plasma
samples for Coagulation Factor X Chromogenic Activity. This protocol
ensures the generation of accurate, precise, and reproducible results.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel trained to perform
chromogenic activity assays for Coagulation Factor X in plasma
samples in the CLIA-certified laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• It is the responsibility of trained laboratory personnel to perform
and document all procedures outlined in this SOP.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring compliance and
appropriate corrective actions as necessary.
4. DEFINITIONS
Factor X Chromogenic Activity Assay: A biochemical test that
measures the activity of Coagulation Factor X based on its ability to
cleave a chromogenic substrate, which results in a color change.
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred Specimen: Platelet-poor plasma collected in sodium
citrate tubes.
• Storage: Plasma must be stored frozen at -70°C or below and
thawed before analysis.
• Unacceptable Specimens: Hemolyzed samples, samples with
incorrect anticoagulants, or specimens thawed and refrozen
multiple times.
6. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Factor X Chromogenic Activity Assay kit (following manufacturer's
guidelines)
• Platelet-poor plasma samples
• Calibrators and controls specific to the assay
• Microplate reader capable of measuring absorbance at [insert
specific wavelength]
• Pipettes and tips
• Centrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Timer
7. PROCEDURE
Pre-analytical Preparation:
1. Verify specimen integrity and suitability:
◦ Check for hemolysis
◦ Verify specimen collection and storage conditions
2. Thaw plasma samples at 37°C in a water bath for 5 minutes
and gently mix.
3. Prepare reagents and calibrators per the manufacturer's
instructions.
Running the Assay:
1. Set up the assay plate:
◦ Pipette [insert volume] of calibrator, control, and plasma
samples into designated wells as per the assay kit
instructions.
2. Add [insert volume] of the chromogenic substrate to each well.
3. Initiate the reaction by adding [insert volume] of the activation
reagent to each well.
4. Incubate the plate at [insert temperature] for [insert duration] as
specified.
5. Stop the reaction by adding [insert stopping solution] if
necessary, according to the kit instructions.
Measurement:
1. Place the assay plate in the microplate reader.
2. Measure the absorbance at [insert specific wavelength]
according to the manufacturer's guidelines.
Calculation of Results:
1. Analyze the absorbance data using the software associated
with the microplate reader or manually if specified.
2. Generate a standard curve from the calibrator readings to
calculate the activity of Factor X in the plasma samples.
3. Document the results in the appropriate result logs.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
Perform routine quality control checks:
• Run assay controls with each batch of tests.
• Verify the factor X activity levels fall within the expected control
ranges.
• Repeat assays if control results are out of range and take
appropriate corrective actions.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
• Monitor results for any inconsistencies.
• Validate results by cross-checking with controls and reference
standards.
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS) and
verify by the technologist.
10. LIMITATIONS
• Factors affecting assay results include sample collection time,
handling, and storage conditions.
• Ensure reagents and controls are within their expiry dates and
stored as per manufacturer’s instructions.
