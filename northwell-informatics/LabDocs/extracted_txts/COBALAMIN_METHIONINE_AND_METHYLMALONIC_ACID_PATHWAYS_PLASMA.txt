SOP: Analytical Phase Protocol for Cobalamin, Methionine, and
Methylmalonic Acid Pathways, Plasma
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedure
for the analysis of plasma samples for cobalamin, methionine,
and methylmalonic acid pathways. This document provides
detailed instructions to ensure standardized and accurate
results.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory staff who perform and document the
analysis of cobalamin, methionine, and methylmalonic acid
pathways in plasma samples.
• Supervisors who oversee the adherence to this SOP and address
deficiencies.
1. DEFINITIONS
• Cobalamin: Vitamin B12, necessary for proper red blood cell
formation, neurological function, and DNA synthesis.
• Methionine: An essential amino acid involved in methylating
processes.
• Methylmalonic Acid: A substance produced in very small amounts
during the metabolism of certain fats and proteins. High levels
may indicate a vitamin B12 deficiency.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENT
• Preferred: Plasma collected in a heparin or EDTA tube.
• Volume: A minimum of 2 mL of plasma.
• Stability: Plasma samples should be frozen at -20°C or below if
stored for more than 24 hours.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed specimens.
• Specimens collected in inappropriate tubes (e.g., tubes containing
other anticoagulants).
• Specimens with insufficient volume.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Automated analyzer specific for cobalamin, methionine, and
methylmalonic acid measurement (e.g., LC-MS/MS).
• Reagent kits specific for cobalamin, methionine, and
methylmalonic acid assays.
• Calibrators and Controls.
• Centrifuge.
• Pipettes and pipette tips.
• Specimen tubes (heparin or EDTA).
1. PROCEDURE A) Sample Preparation:
• Plasma samples should be thawed thoroughly if previously
frozen.
• Centrifuge samples at 1500 x g for 10 minutes to remove
particulate matter.
• Carefully transfer the clear supernatant to a clean sample tube.
B) Instrument Preparation:
• Set up the analyzer according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
• Ensure all reagents, calibrators, and controls are prepared and
ready to use.
• Perform a daily calibration of the instrument using provided
calibrators.
• Run quality control (QC) materials at multiple levels to ensure
instrument performance.
C) Analysis:
• Program the analyzer for the measurement of cobalamin,
methionine, and methylmalonic acid in plasma.
• Load samples into the analyzer.
• Start the analysis according to the specific guidelines of the
instrument manual.
• Monitor instrument performance and report any anomalies to the
supervisor.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run QC materials and document their results at the beginning of
each day or shift.
• QC material results must be within specified limits before
proceeding with patient samples.
• If QC results fall outside acceptable limits, troubleshoot and
resolve issues before analyzing patient samples.
• Perform internal and external QC as per standard laboratory
protocols.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Review and verify all results before reporting them.
• Results must be documented in the laboratory information system
(LIS).
• Flag values that fall outside the reference range and require
further investigation.
• Document any instrument errors or abnormalities that occur
during the analysis.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS Reference intervals for cobalamin,
methionine, and methylmalonic acid in plasma must be
established and maintained in accordance with clinical
guidelines and laboratory validation studies.
• Cobalamin: 200 - 900 pg/mL
• Methionine: Variable based on laboratory-specific assays and
age-related ranges
• Methylmalonic Acid: 0.07 - 0.27 µmol/L (age-specific variations
may apply)
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolyzed samples can lead to inaccurate cobalamin levels.
• Ensure accurate pipetting techniques to avoid variation in sample
volume.
• Cross-reactivity and interference should be evaluated as per the
manufacturer’s guidelines.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instruction manuals for the analyzer and reagent
kits.
• Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines.
• Relevant clinical literature on cobalamin, methionine, and
methylmalonic acid assessment.
By following this SOP, laboratory staff will ensure accurate and
consistent results in the measurement of cobalamin, methionine, and
methylmalonic acid pathways in plasma.
