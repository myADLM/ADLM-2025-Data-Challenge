STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP) FOR ANALYSIS OF
COBALAMIN, METHIONINE, AND METHYLMALONIC ACID
PATHWAYS IN SERUM
1. PURPOSE
This procedure details the steps necessary for the analysis of serum
cobalamin (Vitamin B12), methionine, and methylmalonic acid levels
using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)
or any other appropriate and validated analytical method. The
measurements are crucial for the diagnosis and management of
deficiency, metabolic disorders, and related conditions.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of trained laboratory personnel to perform the
analysis accurately and ensure the reliability of the results.
Designated personnel also ensure maintenance, calibration, and
quality control of the instruments used.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND PREPARATION
• Specimen Type: Serum
• Volume Required: Minimum of 2 mL
• Collection Tubes: SST (Serum Separator Tubes, red-top) or
plain red-top tubes without anticoagulant.
• Processing: Allow blood to clot at room temperature for 30
minutes. Centrifuge at 1500 x g for 10 minutes at 4°C to separate
serum. Transfer serum aliquot into a polypropylene storage tube.
• Storage and Stability:
◦ Room Temperature: Up to 8 hours
◦ Refrigerated (2-8°C): Up to 72 hours
◦ Frozen (-20°C or lower): Stable for up to 6 months
4. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Instruments: Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometer
(LC-MS/MS) or other suitable validated instrument.
• Reagents:
◦ Mobile phases (e.g., water, methanol, acetonitrile, formic acid)
◦ Calibrators and controls (commercially available or prepared
in-house with certified reference materials).
• Supplies:
◦ Polypropylene vials
◦ Pipettes and pipette tips
◦ Centrifuge
◦ Analytical balance
◦ Sample preparation kits (if required)
5. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation and Calibration:
1. Calibrator and Control Preparation:
◦ Prepare calibrators and controls according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Include a minimum of five calibrator concentrations
spanning the expected range of patient samples.
◦ Prepare internal standards at a consistent concentration.
2. Column Preparation:
◦ Install and equilibrate LC column with appropriate mobile
phases.
◦ Perform usual column conditioning and system checks.
B. Sample Preparation:
1. Protein Precipitation (if required):
◦ Add 200 µL of serum to 500 µL of protein precipitation
reagent (e.g., methanol) containing internal standard.
◦ Vortex thoroughly for 1 minute and let stand for 10 minutes
at room temperature.
◦ Centrifuge at 14,000 x g for 10 minutes to pellet the
precipitated proteins.
2. Supernatant Collection:
◦ Carefully transfer the supernatant into a clean polypropylene
vial for LC-MS/MS analysis.
C. Chromatographic and Mass Spectrometric Analysis:
1. Injection:
◦ Inject an appropriate volume of calibrators, controls, and
patient samples into the LC-MS/MS system.
2. Chromatographic Conditions:
◦ Set appropriate LC conditions including mobile phase
composition, flow rate, and column temperature, following
the standard method development.
3. Mass Spectrometric Conditions:
◦ Optimize ionization parameters, including source
temperature, gas flow rates, and voltage settings.
◦ Ensure proper MRM (Multiple Reaction Monitoring)
transitions for cobalamin, methionine, methylmalonic acid,
and an internal standard.
D. Data Analysis:
1. Quantification:
◦ Use software to quantify the amount of cobalamin,
methionine, and methylmalonic acid.
◦ Correct for any matrix effects using the internal standard.
2. Validity Check:
◦ Ensure that all QC samples are within acceptable limits
before reporting patient results.
◦ Re-run any sample if QC fails.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
• Reference Ranges:
◦ Cobalamin (Vitamin B12): 200-900 pg/mL
◦ Methionine: Refer to specific laboratory guidelines.
◦ Methylmalonic Acid: <0.4 µmol/L
• All results are to be reviewed and verified by the technologist.
Critical results should be communicated to the requesting
physician immediately following laboratory protocols.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run control samples every batch to ensure the reliability of the
assay.
• Perform inter-lab and intra-lab quality assessments bi-weekly.
8. TROUBLESHOOTING AND MAINTENANCE
• Instrument Calibration and Maintenance:
◦ Regularly calibrate and maintain LC-MS/MS system as per the
instrument manual.
◦ Keep records of all maintenance and calibrations performed
on the instruments.
• Troubleshooting:
◦ In case of any drift in QC results or instrument malfunction,
follow the manufacturer's troubleshooting guide.
◦ Report prolonged issues to a supervisor for further
assessment.
9. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s guidelines for LC-MS/MS instruments.
• Relevant peer-reviewed literature on serum cobalamin,
methionine, and methylmalonic acid assays.

10. DOCUMENTATION
Maintain a log of all results, calibration curves, and QC data.
Documentation should be thorough and comply with the laboratory’s
record-keeping policies.
