Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Title: Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for COBALT, 24 HOUR, URINE
1. PURPOSE
To ensure accurate and precise measurement of cobalt in 24-hour
urine specimens using inductively coupled plasma mass
spectrometry (ICP-MS).
1. RESPONSIBILITY
This procedure is to be conducted by trained laboratory scientists
familiar with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry and trace
metal analysis.
1. SPECIMEN
a. Type: 24-hour urine collection. b. Volume: A minimum of 10 mL is
required for analysis. c. Collection: Specimen should be collected in a
clean, trace-metal-free plastic container. Urine should be acidified
with 6M HCl to maintain pH < 2 and stored at 2-8°C until transport to
the laboratory. d. Acceptance criteria: Properly labeled specimens
must be received with complete 24-hour collection information
recorded (start and end times). e. Unacceptable criteria: Specimens
with no collection time, improperly labeled, contaminated, or received
in non-trace metal free container.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
a. Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer (ICP-MS) b.
Trace-metal-free plasticware and containers c. Analytical balance d.
HCl (6M for acidification) e. Deionized water (18 MΩ cm) f. Multi-
element calibration standards g. Cobalt specific calibration standards
h. Cobalt control material i. Nitric acid (suprapure grade) j. Internal
standard solution (e.g., Rhodium)
1. QUALITY CONTROL
a. Calibration: Multi-element and cobalt-specific calibration standards
should be prepared at least weekly and used for instrument
calibration. b. Controls: Run control samples (low, medium, and high)
with each analytical batch. c. Internal standard: Use rhodium or other
appropriate internal standard to correct for any instrument-related
fluctuations and matrix effects. d. Blank: Run reagent blanks to
monitor for contamination. e. Repeatability: Duplicate analysis of 10%
of patient samples must be performed to check for repeatability of the
test results.
1. PROCEDURE
a. Preparation of Standards and Quality Controls i. Prepare a series
of cobalt calibration standards in sterile matrix or synthetic urine. ii.
Prepare the internal standard solution in deionized water and dilute
appropriately.
b. Sample Preparation i. Mix 24-hour urine thoroughly. ii. Aliquot 10
mL of urine into a clean trace-metal-free container. iii. Add 0.5 mL of
internal standard and dilute with deionized water to a final volume of
20 mL. iv. Acidify the sample mixture with 2 mL of suprapure nitric
acid.
c. Instrument Calibration i. Perform a multi-element calibration using
calibration standards. ii. Verify instrument calibration with known
cobalt control samples. iii. Baseline correct and optimize sensitivity
for cobalt detection.
d. Sample Analysis i. Analyze Patient samples along with quality
control samples using ICP-MS. ii. Run a reagent blank after every 10
samples to detect any carryover or contamination. iii. Monitor internal
standard recovery for each sample. iv. Acquire data for each sample,
ensuring precision and accuracy of results.
e. Data Analysis & Review i. Calculate the cobalt concentration of
each specimen using the standards curve generated. ii. Ensure QC
samples fall within set quality control acceptance ranges. iii. Confirm
that internal standard recovery is within acceptable limits (e.g.,
85-115%).
f. Reporting Results i. Record results in the laboratory information
system (LIS). ii. Review results for accuracy and completeness. iii.
Release results and verify with appropriate comments if there are any
deviations or issues (e.g., insufficient sample volume).
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS:
Healthy adults: i. Cobalt in 24-hour urine: < 2 µg/L
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
i. High protein concentration or contaminating elements in urine
may affect test results. ii. Ensure all reagents and materials are
trace-metal-free to prevent contamination. iii. Ensure proper
handling and preservation techniques to avoid sample
deterioration that may affect results.
2. REFERENCES:
i. Manufacturer’s instructions for ICP-MS instrument. ii. CLSI
guidelines for trace metal analysis in clinical laboratories. iii.
Relevant peer-reviewed journals and established literature in
trace metal analysis.
This SOP must be strictly followed to ensure accurate and reliable
results for cobalt analysis in 24-hour urine specimens. All deviations
should be documented and reviewed by senior laboratory personnel.
