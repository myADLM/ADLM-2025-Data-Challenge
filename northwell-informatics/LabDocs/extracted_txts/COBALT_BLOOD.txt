Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for
Analytical Phase of Generating Results for
Cobalt, Blood
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the procedure for the analysis of cobalt in blood
specimens in order to ensure accurate and reliable results.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all staff members responsible for
performing the analysis of cobalt in blood specimens in the
laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory personnel to
perform the analysis of cobalt in blood specimens as per this SOP.
The staff must ensure adherence to quality control procedures and
timely documentation of results. It is also their responsibility to report
any deviations or incidents to the supervisor.
4. SPECIMEN
Acceptable Specimens
• Blood collected in a royal blue-top tube containing EDTA or
heparin as anticoagulant.
Unacceptable Specimens
• Clotted blood specimens.
• Specimens in tubes containing an anticoagulant other than
specified.
• Specimens not properly labeled or without requisition forms.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer (ICP-MS) or
Atomic Absorption Spectrometer (AAS)
• Cobalt standard solutions
• Quality control materials
• Reagent-grade nitric acid
• Deionized water
• Sample preparation materials (pipettes, vials, etc.)
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE): gloves, lab coat, safety
glasses
6. PROCEDURE
A) Pre-Analytical Preparations
1. Receiving and Logging Specimens:
◦ Verify specimen integrity and labeling.
◦ Log specimen details into the laboratory information system
(LIS).
2. Preparation of Reagent and Standards:
◦ Prepare working standards of cobalt by diluting stock cobalt
standard solutions with reagent-grade nitric acid and
deionized water.
◦ Prepare quality control materials as per the manufacturer’s
instructions.
3. Equipment Calibration:
◦ Perform calibration of ICP-MS or AAS using cobalt
standards before analysis.
◦ Document calibration data in the appropriate logbook.
B) Sample Preparation
1. Dilution and Digestion:
◦ Pipette an appropriate volume (e.g., 0.5 mL) of blood
specimen into a digestion vial.
◦ Add a specified volume of reagent-grade nitric acid.
◦ Heat samples to aid in digestion as per equipment
specifications.
◦ Allow the samples to cool, then dilute to final volume with
deionized water.
2. Preparation of Calibration Curve:
◦ Prepare a calibration curve by analyzing standards ranging
from the detection limit to the upper limit of cobalt
concentrations expected in blood.
C) Analytical Procedure
1. Instrument Setup:
◦ Set up the ICP-MS or AAS according to the manufacturer’s
instructions, ensuring all settings (e.g., wavelength, lamp
current) are appropriate for cobalt analysis.
2. Analysis:
◦ Run the prepared blood specimens, blank, calibration
standards, and quality controls through the instrument.
◦ Monitor the stability and performance of the instrument
throughout the run.
3. Data Collection and Analysis:
◦ Collect data for each sample, ensuring results fall within the
calibration curve range.
◦ Apply appropriate corrections for any background signals if
necessary.
D) Post-Analytical Procedures
1. Quality Control Assessment:
◦ Review quality control results to ensure they fall within
acceptable ranges.
◦ Reanalyze specimens if quality control criteria are not met.
2. Data Review and Validation:
◦ Validate results by comparing patient samples to quality
control samples.
◦ Document results and any deviations in the LIS.
3. Result Reporting:
◦ Convert raw data into final concentration values using the
calibration curve.
◦ Transmit validated results to the LIS for reporting.
4. Sample Storage and Disposal:
◦ Store remaining specimen aliquots as per laboratory policy
for potential retesting.
◦ Dispose of digested samples and reagents in compliance
with hazardous waste disposal guidelines.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Review quality control logs regularly.
• Perform instrument maintenance and calibration as per the
manufacturer’s schedule.
• Participate in external proficiency testing programs to validate
analytical performance.
8. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS
• Follow standard safety guidelines including wearing appropriate
PPE.
• Handle all chemicals, especially nitric acid, with care in a well-
ventilated area or fume hood.
• Dispose of all waste materials according to laboratory safety
protocols.
9. DOCUMENTATION
• Record all calibration, quality control, and specimen analysis data
in appropriate logbooks and the LIS.
• Maintain records of all maintenance, calibration checks, and
instrument performance validations.

• Manufacturer’s manuals and guidelines for ICP-MS or AAS.
• Relevant clinical guidelines for cobalt measurement in blood.
• Internal laboratory policies and procedures.
This SOP ensures that all specimens are analyzed for cobalt
accurately and consistently, ensuring reliable results for clinical
interpretation. All personnel must adhere strictly to the steps outlined
to maintain high standards of laboratory practice.
