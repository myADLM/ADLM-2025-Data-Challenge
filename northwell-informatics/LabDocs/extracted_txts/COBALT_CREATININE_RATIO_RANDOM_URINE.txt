Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for COBALT/CREATININE
RATIO, RANDOM, URINE Analysis
1. PURPOSE
This SOP provides the procedure for the analysis of random urine
samples to determine the Cobalt/Creatinine Ratio to ensure
consistency, accuracy, and reliability of test results.
Responsibility:
• It is the responsibility of the laboratory technologist to carry out
the procedure and analysis as outlined in this SOP.
• It is the responsibility of the laboratory supervisor to ensure that
the staff are trained and adhere to this procedure.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen Type:
• Preferred/acceptable: 10-15 mL of random urine collected in a
clean, dry container.
Specimen Stability:
• Specimens should be refrigerated at 2-8°C if not immediately
processed.
• Specimens are stable for up to 7 days when refrigerated.
• Specimens that have been frozen at -20°C are stable for up to 6
months.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens that are not labeled correctly.
• Specimens with visible contamination.
• Specimens older than 7 days if stored refrigerated or
unpreserved.
• Specimens that were frozen and thawed more than once.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes (automated or manual)
• Urine Creatinine Analyzer
• Cobalt Assay kit with analyzer
Reagents and Supplies:
• Cobalt Assay Reagent kit (specific to the analyzer being used)
• Creatinine Reagent kit (specific to the analyzer being used)
• Calibrators and Controls for Cobal assay and creatinine assay
• Deionized water
• Urine collection containers
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
1. PROCEDURE
A) Sample Preparation:
1. Mix the urine sample thoroughly before aliquoting.
2. If the sample has particulate matter, centrifuge at 3,000 RPM
for 5 minutes and carefully transfer the supernatant to a clean
tube.
B) Creatinine Measurement:
1. Calibrate the creatinine analyzer as per the manufacturer’s
instructions using provided calibrators.
2. Pipette an appropriate volume of urine (as specified by the
reagent kit’s protocol) into labeled tubes or wells.
3. Add the creatinine reagent to each tube or well, ensuring proper
mixing.
4. Follow the incubation and measurement procedure as indicated
by the creatinine assay kit.
5. Record the creatinine concentration.
C) Cobalt Measurement:
1. Calibrate the cobalt analyzer as per the manufacturer’s
instructions using provided calibrators.
2. Pipette an appropriate volume of urine (as specified by the
reagent kit’s protocol) into labeled tubes or wells.
3. Add the cobalt reagent to each tube or well, ensuring proper
mixing.
4. Follow the incubation and measurement procedure as indicated
by the cobalt assay kit.
5. Record the cobalt concentration.
D) Calculation:
1. Calculate the Cobalt/Creatinine Ratio as follows:
◦ Cobalt/Creatinine Ratio = (Concentration of Cobalt in µg/L) /
(Concentration of Creatinine in mg/dL)
2. Ensure that values are within clinically acceptable limits before
reporting.
3. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run quality control samples along with patient samples. Quality
control samples should be run at the beginning of each shift, with
each batch of patient samples, and whenever reagent lots are
changed.
• Include both normal and abnormal control levels.
• Document all quality control results, and take appropriate
corrective action if controls are outside acceptable ranges.
• Verify instrument calibration daily or as per manufacturer’s
recommendation.
• Participate in an external proficiency program to ensure the
accuracy of results.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• The Cobalt/Creatinine Ratio results must be reviewed and
validated by the laboratory technologist before reporting.
• Document results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Report results according to the lab’s reporting protocol, ensuring
inclusion of any comments regarding sample integrity or QC
issues.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to the assay kit insert for specific limitations regarding
interfering substances or conditions that may affect the accuracy
of Cobalt or Creatinine measurements.
• Understanding that variability in urine concentration can affect the
ratio, ensuring hydration status or collection variability is
considered.
