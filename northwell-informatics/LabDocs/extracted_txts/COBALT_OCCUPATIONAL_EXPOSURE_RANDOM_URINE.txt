Standard Operating Protocol (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for COBALT OCCUPATIONAL EXPOSURE,
RANDOM, URINE
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedure for the accurate
and timely analysis of cobalt concentrations in random urine samples
to monitor occupational exposure. This protocol governs the
methodology, instrumentation, quality control measures, and result
reporting procedures specific to this test.
Responsibility:
• It is the responsibility of the laboratory technologists to adhere to
this SOP when performing the cobalt occupational exposure urine
analysis.
• The supervisor must ensure that all staff are appropriately trained
and that procedures are followed.
1. SPECIMEN
Preferred/Acceptable:
• 10-25 mL of random urine collected in a clean, plastic container
without any preservatives.
• The sample should be transported to the laboratory as soon as
possible after collection. If there is a delay in transport, refrigerate
at 2-8°C for up to 48 hours. For storage longer than 48 hours,
freeze the sample at -20°C.
Unacceptable:
• Specimens with contaminants such as feces.
• Urine samples collected in containers with preservatives.
• Samples that have not been stored properly (e.g., not refrigerated
or frozen if kept beyond 48 hours).
• Samples that are less than 10 mL in volume.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• ICP-MS (Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry)
instrument.
• Plasticware (urine collection cups, conical centrifuge tubes,
pipette tips).
• Nitric acid (ultra-pure, for sample digestion).
• Cobalt standard solutions for calibration.
• Urine matrix matched controls.
• Deionized water (18MΩ).
• Protective equipment (gloves, lab coats, safety glasses).
1. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation:
1. Properly identify and label each specimen received.
2. Mix the urine sample thoroughly to ensure homogeneity.
3. Aliquot 5 mL of the urine sample into a conical centrifuge tube.
4. Add 1 mL of ultra-pure nitric acid to the urine aliquot.
5. Allow the sample to digest at room temperature for 30 minutes.
6. Dilute the digested sample to a final volume of 10 mL with
deionized water.
B. Instrument Calibration:
1. Prepare calibration standards using the cobalt standard
solutions.
2. Run the calibration standards on the ICP-MS to generate a
calibration curve.
3. Verify that calibration standards fall within the acceptable range.
C. Sample Analysis:
1. Prepare the ICP-MS for sample analysis by following the
manufacturer's instructions for instrument setup and tuning.
2. Analyze the urine samples, controls, and blanks in a random
sequence.
3. Include a quality control sample for every batch of 20 urine
samples.
4. Ensure that the internal standard remains within acceptable
limits for each sample run.
D. Quality Control:
1. Use urine matrix matched controls at two levels (low and high)
to validate the accuracy and precision of the ICP-MS.
2. Record and monitor the QC results. If a QC fails, troubleshoot
and reanalyze the samples after correcting the issue.
3. Document all QC data in the appropriate log for traceability.
E. Data Analysis and Results Interpretation:
1. Quantify the cobalt concentration in each urine sample using
the calibration curve.
2. Perform data verification to ensure the accuracy of the results.
3. Compare the sample results with the control data to confirm
that the results are valid.
4. REPORTING RESULTS
A. Data Entry:
1. Enter the quantified cobalt concentration into the Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
2. Ensure that each result is reviewed and verified by a qualified
technologist.
B. Reference Interval:
• Report the reference interval as specified by the occupational
health guidelines (e.g., typically < 1.0 µg/L for non-exposure
levels).
C. Critical Values:
• Notify the appropriate personnel if the cobalt concentration
exceeds established occupational exposure limits (e.g., > 15 µg/
L).
D. Documentation:
• Maintain documentation of all results, QC data, and calibration
curves for a minimum of five years.
• Provide results to the requester in the standard laboratory report
format.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Possible interferences from other metals or matrix effects should
be considered.
• Ensure that all reagents and consumables are free of cobalt
contamination to avoid false positives.
1. REFERENCES
• Occupational Health and Safety guidelines for cobalt exposure.
• Manufacturer’s instructions for the ICP-MS instrument.
• Internal laboratory policies and regulations.
1. REVISION HISTORY
• Keep a record of any revisions to this SOP, including dates and
changes made.
