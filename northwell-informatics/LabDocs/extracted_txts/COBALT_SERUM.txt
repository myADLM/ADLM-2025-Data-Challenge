Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for COBALT, SERUM
Analysis
1. PURPOSE To provide a standardized protocol for the analysis of
serum cobalt levels using atomic absorption spectrophotometry
(AAS).
2. SCOPE This procedure applies to all clinical and laboratory staff
involved in the analytical phase of cobalt serum testing.
3. RESPONSIBILITY It is the responsibility of the clinical laboratory
technologist to perform serum cobalt analysis following the specified
protocol and ensuring the accuracy and reliability of test results. The
laboratory supervisor is responsible for ensuring compliance with this
SOP.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STORAGE
• Preferred Specimen: Serum
• Collection Tube: Royal blue, trace element-free tube
• Volume: Minimum 2 ml of serum
• Specimen Storage: Serum should be stored at 2-8°C for up to 7
days. If analysis is delayed beyond 7 days, serum should be
frozen at -20°C.
5. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Equipment: Atomic absorption spectrophotometer with graphite
furnace, micropipettes, vortex mixer, centrifuge
• Reagents: Cobalt standard, diluent (e.g., high-purity water), matrix
modifiers (e.g., ammonium phosphate), nitric acid, serum protein
remover
6. CALIBRATION AND QUALITY CONTROL
• Calibration:
◦ Prepare cobalt standard solutions at concentrations of 0, 10,
20, 40, 60 µg/L by diluting the stock cobalt standard solution.
◦ Run the standard solutions on the AAS to generate a
calibration curve.
• Quality Control:
◦ Prepare and analyze low, medium, and high cobalt control
samples.
◦ QC samples must be run at the start, during (after every 10
samples), and at the end of each analytical batch.
◦ Results must be within acceptable ranges provided by the QC
material provider; any deviation must be investigated and
rectified before proceeding.
7. PROCEDURE
• Sample Preparation:
◦ Allow serum samples to reach room temperature.
◦ Vortex to ensure homogeneity.
◦ Centrifuge samples at 3000 rpm for 15 minutes to remove any
particulates.
◦ Transfer 1 ml of clear serum into a polypropylene tube.
◦ Add an equal volume of nitric acid (1:1 dilution) to each serum
sample.
◦ Vortex and let stand for 30 minutes for protein precipitation.
◦ Centrifuge at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes to separate the
supernatant.
◦ Carefully transfer the supernatant to a clean polypropylene
tube.
• Instrument Setup:
◦ Set the AAS to detect cobalt at the specific wavelength (e.g.,
240.73 nm).
◦ Calibrate the instrument using the prepared standard
solutions.
• Sample Analysis:
◦ Inject the matrix modifier into the graphite furnace.
◦ Follow with the introduction of 20 µl of prepared serum
supernatant.
◦ Run the samples in batches, ensuring a blank is included
between batches to avoid carryover.
◦ Record absorbance readings for each sample.
8. CALCULATION OF RESULTS
• Use the calibration curve to determine the concentration of cobalt
in each serum sample based on the absorbance readings.
• Multiply by the dilution factor to obtain the final concentration in
µg/L.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results should be reviewed and validated by the responsible
technologist.
• Enter the results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Flag any critical values as defined by institutional guidelines and
immediately notify the ordering physician.
10. METHOD LIMITATIONS Refer to the manufacturer’s manual for
the AAS for interferences and limitations particular to the analytical
method.
11. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• The reference interval for serum cobalt must be established
based on the laboratory's validation data and literature
references. Commonly, the normal reference range for serum
cobalt is < 1 µg/L.
12. DOCUMENTATION AND RECORD-KEEPING
• All calibration data, quality control results, and specimen records
must be maintained as per regulatory requirements for at least
two years.
• Document any deviations, corrective actions, and instrument
maintenance logs.
13. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If results are unexpectedly high or low, recheck the calibration and
quality control materials.
• Ensure all reagents and equipment are functioning correctly
before reanalyzing the sample.
