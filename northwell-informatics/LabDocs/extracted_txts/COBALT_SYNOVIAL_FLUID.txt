Standard Operating Procedure: Analytical Phase for
Determination of Cobalt in Synovial Fluid
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedures for the analytical
phase of determining cobalt levels in synovial fluid. This includes
specimen preparation, reagent usage, equipment operation, quality
control measures, data reporting, and troubleshooting procedures.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for following the
steps outlined in this SOP and ensuring accurate and precise results.
It is the responsibility of all staff to identify any deficiencies in testing
and to bring them to the attention of the laboratory supervisor.
1. DEFINITIONS
Synovial Fluid: The viscous fluid found in the cavities of synovial
joints, aiding in their lubrication. Cobalt: A metallic element commonly
measured for its implications in orthopedic implant complications.
Analytical Phase: The phase of testing involving specimen
preparation, handling, and instrumental analysis.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Preferred/acceptable:
• Synovial fluid samples should be collected in sterile containers
(e.g., BD Vacutainer).
• Ensure samples are transported and stored at 2-8°C prior to
analysis.
• Samples should be analyzed within 48 hours of collection to
ensure stability of cobalt levels.
Unacceptable:
• Samples containing substantial particulate matter or that have
visibly degraded.
• Specimens collected in containers with additives known to
interfere with cobalt measurement.
• Specimens received >48 hours post-collection without proper
storage.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer (ICP-MS) or
Atomic Absorption Spectrometer (AAS)
• Calibration standards (traceable to National Institute of Standards
and Technology, NIST)
• High-purity reagents (e.g., nitric acid, distilled water)
• Sample preparation equipment (e.g., centrifuge, pipettes, sterile
containers)
1. PROCEDURE
Calibration and Instrument Setup:
1. Instigate a daily calibration of the ICP-MS or AAS using the
traceable cobalt standards.
2. Verify instrument operating conditions, ensuring they match
specifications recommended by the manufacturer.
3. Run quality control samples to validate calibration curves.
Sample Preparation:
1. Centrifuge synovial fluid samples at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes to
separate any particulate matter if necessary.
2. Pipette an appropriate and aliquot amount of the supernatant
into clean, sterilized containers.
3. Dilute the samples with high-purity reagents as necessary
(following method specifications, usually involving nitric acid).
Analytical Measurement:
1. Introduce prepared samples and standards into the ICP-MS or
AAS.
2. Conduct measurements according to the established method
protocol. Ensure all instrumental readings fall within the
calibrated range.
3. Record all obtained data meticulously, noting any deviations or
analytical peculiarities.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
5. Analyze quality control samples alongside patient specimens to
verify instrument performance.
6. Ensure control limits are pre-defined and documented. If
controls fall outside acceptable ranges, investigate and re-
analyze.
7. Maintain all quality control records for review and auditing
purposes.
8. TROUBLESHOOTING
9. If an instrument error occurs, follow troubleshooting procedures
as delineated in the manufacturer’s manual.
10. Check quality control outcomes; rerun specimens if results fall
outside acceptable ranges.
11. Report any persistent issues to the laboratory supervisor and
escalate to technical support if necessary.
12. REPORTING RESULTS
13. Results will be automatically transmitted to the LIS for review.
14. All results must be verified by a trained technologist before
release.
15. Critical results should be communicated directly to the ordering
physician following established protocols.
16. REFERENCES
Refer to the manufacturer's instrument manual for specific operating
procedures.
1. DOCUMENTATION
Maintain thorough documentation for each step of the process in the
laboratory’s logbooks. Ensure all findings and corrective actions are
meticulously noted.
This SOP is intended to provide comprehensive guidance on the
analytical procedures for determining cobalt levels in synovial fluid to
ensure accurate, reliable, and timely results.
