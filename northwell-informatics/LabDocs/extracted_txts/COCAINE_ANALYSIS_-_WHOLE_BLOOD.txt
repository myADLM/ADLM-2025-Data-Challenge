STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP)
COCAINE ANALYSIS - WHOLE BLOOD
1. PURPOSE
This procedure outlines the steps required for the analysis of cocaine
in whole blood samples. These steps ensure that results are
accurate, reliable, and produced consistently, thereby supporting
effective clinical and forensic decisions.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel involved in the analysis
of cocaine in whole blood samples within a CLIA-certified clinical or
forensic laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Laboratory Technologists: Responsible for sample preparation,
analysis, and initial review of results.
• Supervisors: Ensure compliance with the protocol, handle
troubleshooting, and validate final results.
• Quality Control Personnel: Monitor and document quality
control measures to maintain the accuracy and precision of
results.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Gas Chromatograph-Mass Spectrometer (GC-MS)
• Calibrated balances
• Centrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Pipettes and tips
• Appropriate PPEs (gloves, lab coat, eye protection)
• Reagent-grade chemicals, including:
◦ Internal Standard (e.g., deuterated cocaine)
◦ Sodium fluoride/potassium oxalate tubes
◦ Extraction solvents (e.g., methanol, acetone)
◦ Calibration standards of cocaine
◦ Control samples (negative and positive)
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
• Preferred/Acceptable:
◦ Whole blood collected in sodium fluoride/potassium oxalate
tubes.
◦ Volume: 5 mL minimum.
• Stability:
◦ Store samples at 2-8°C if analysis is performed within 72
hours.
◦ For longer storage, freeze samples at -20°C.
6. PROCEDURE
A) SAMPLE PREPARATION AND EXTRACTION:
1. Labeling:
◦ Verify and label each sample appropriately.
2. Preparation:
◦ Allow frozen samples to thaw at room temperature.
◦ Vortex the whole blood samples thoroughly before
processing (10 seconds).
3. Internal Standard Addition:
◦ Spike 1 mL of whole blood with a known quantity of internal
standard (e.g., deuterated cocaine).
4. Extraction:
◦ Add 5 mL of extraction solvent (methanol/acetone mixture)
to the spiked sample.
◦ Vortex the mixture vigorously for 1 minute.
◦ Centrifuge at 4000 rpm for 10 minutes.
◦ Carefully transfer the organic layer (supernatant) to a clean
tube without disturbing the pellet.
B) SAMPLE ANALYSIS:
1. GC-MS Setup:
◦ Ensure the GC-MS is calibrated according to manufacturer’s
instructions with cocaine calibration standards.
◦ Perform instrument blank runs to check for contamination.
2. Injection:
◦ Inject 1 µL of the prepared sample into the GC-MS.
3. Data Acquisition:
◦ Set the GC-MS parameters for cocaine detection (refer to
instrument manual for specific settings).
◦ Allow the system to acquire data and automatically quantify
the cocaine concentration based on the calibration curve.
C) QUALITY CONTROL:
1. Quality Control Samples:
◦ Include at least one positive control and one negative
control in each batch of samples processed.
◦ Ensure the positive control is within ±15% of the known
value and the negative control shows no peaks at the
retention time of cocaine.
2. Data Verification:
◦ Initial review of the chromatographs by the technologist for
peaks corresponding to cocaine.
◦ Review and sign-off by a supervisor.
D) REPORTING RESULTS:
1. Results Calculation:
◦ Use the internal standard method for calculating cocaine
concentration in samples.
2. Result Documentation:
◦ Document the results as per laboratory reporting guidelines.
3. Submission:
◦ Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
◦ Ensure all results are reviewed and validated prior to
release.
7. LIMITATIONS
• Ensure samples are appropriately stored and handled to prevent
degradation.
• Contamination from other substances or improper handling can
lead to inaccurate results.
• Ensure the preparation and extraction processes are thoroughly
followed.
