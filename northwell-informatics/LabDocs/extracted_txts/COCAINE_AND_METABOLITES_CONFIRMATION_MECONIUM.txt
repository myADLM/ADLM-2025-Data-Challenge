COCAINE AND METABOLITES CONFIRMATION, MECONIUM
PROTOCOL
1. PURPOSE
To outline the standard procedures for the analytical phase of
generating results for Cocaine and Metabolites Confirmation in
meconium specimens.
Responsibility:
Designated staff are responsible for performing analytical procedures
according to this protocol. It is the responsibility of the laboratory staff
to ensure the accuracy, reproducibility, and timely completion of
results.
1. DEFINITION
Cocaine and metabolites confirmation refers to the identification and
quantification of cocaine and its primary metabolites in meconium
specimens utilizing advanced analytical techniques to confirm
preliminary positive findings.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/acceptable:
• Meconium specimens collected in clean, non-reactive containers.
• Specimen volume: 1-5 grams of meconium.
Unacceptable:
• Specimens with insufficient meconium.
• Specimens contaminated with foreign substances.
• Specimens not stored appropriately before sending to the
laboratory.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• LC-MS/MS (Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry)
system.
• Vortex mixer.
• Centrifuge.
• Pipettes and tips.
• Meconium extraction kits.
• Calibration standards and controls specific to cocaine and its
metabolites.
• Organic solvents (e.g., acetonitrile, methanol).
• 0.1% formic acid in water and organic solvents.
1. PROCEDURE
A) Specimen Preparation:
1. Verify the specimen and ensure it meets acceptance criteria.
2. Weigh out approximately 1 gram of meconium into a clean
extraction tube.
3. Add appropriate buffer solution or extraction solvent to the tube.
4. Vortex the mixture thoroughly to homogenize the meconium.
5. Centrifuge the sample for 10 minutes at 3,000 rpm to separate
the solid and liquid phases.
6. Carefully transfer the supernatant into a clean vial for analysis.
B) Calibration and Quality Control:
1. Prepare calibration standards and controls according to the
manufacturer’s recommendations.
2. Run calibration curves for cocaine and metabolites before
sample analysis.
3. Include internal quality controls (both positive and negative) in
each batch of specimens analyzed.
C) LC-MS/MS Analysis:
1. Ensure the LC-MS/MS system is clean, calibrated, and ready
for sample injection.
2. Transfer the extracted sample and calibration standards into
autosampler vials.
3. Load the vials into the autosampler.
4. Initialize the LC-MS/MS sequence specifying appropriate
settings for cocaine and metabolites analysis.
5. Monitor the system during the run to ensure proper operation.
D) Data Analysis:
1. Review chromatograms and spectral data for each sample and
control.
2. Quantify the presence of cocaine and its metabolites using the
calibration curve.
3. Verify the accuracy of the results by comparing them with
quality control data.
4. If any discrepancies arise, reanalyze the sample to ensure
proper results.
E) Reporting Results:
1. Document all findings and verify initial results.
2. Generate a detailed report indicating the presence and
concentration of cocaine and its metabolites.
3. Forward the report for verification by a senior technologist.
4. Send the final confirmed results to the physician or authorized
personnel as defined in site-specific reporting guidelines.
F) Troubleshooting Steps:
1. If the analysis fails to meet quality control criteria, identify the
source of the error (e.g., calibration errors, system
malfunctions).
2. Re-run quality controls to ensure all systems are functioning.
3. If the problem persists, consult with the supervisor for further
action and instrument maintenance.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
Material:
• Calibration standards for cocaine and metabolites.
• Quality control samples with known concentrations.
Storage:
• Standards and controls stored at temperatures recommended by
the manufacturer.
Procedure:
• Quality control analysis must be performed with each batch of
specimens.
• Record all QC results and actions in the log.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Standard reference intervals for cocaine and metabolites in
meconium to be referred from external sources or site-specific
established intervals.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's instructions for the LC-MS/MS system.
• Relevant scientific literature and guidelines on cocaine and
metabolites analysis in meconium.
1. DOCUMENTATION AND RECORD KEEPING
Maintain a detailed log of specimens processed, calibration curves,
QC results, analytical data, and reports. Ensure storage and
confidentiality as per laboratory standards and regulatory guidelines.
This protocol ensures the analytical phase of generating results for
Cocaine and Metabolites Confirmation in meconium is conducted
systematically, maintaining high accuracy and reliability in results.
