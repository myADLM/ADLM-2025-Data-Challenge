Protocol for Cocaine and Metabolites Analysis in Umbilical Cord
Tissue
1. PURPOSE
To outline the standard operating procedure for the analysis of
cocaine and its metabolites in umbilical cord tissue using validated
analytical methods. This protocol ensures accurate, reliable, and
timely results by adhering to a structured analytical process.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to the analysis of cocaine and its primary
metabolites - benzoylecgonine, ecgonine methyl ester, and
norcocaine - in umbilical cord tissue specimens received by the
laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
Laboratory Technicians:
• Accession and prepare samples according to this protocol.
• Perform cocaine and metabolite analysis according to standard
operating procedures and quality control measures.
• Document all steps and results accurately.
Supervisors:
• Ensure adherence to this protocol and provide guidance as
needed.
• Review and verify results before releasing them to ordering
physicians.
4. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
• Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)
system
• High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system
(optional)
• Sample homogenizer (e.g., bead mill or tissue grinder)
• Microcentrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Analytical balance
• Reagent-grade solvents (e.g., methanol, acetonitrile)
• Calibration standards and quality control materials
• Sample tubes and vials
5. REAGENTS
• Internal standard (Deuterated cocaine or other suitable standards)
• Mobile phase solvents (e.g., water, methanol, formic acid)
• Extraction solvents (e.g., methanol, acetonitrile)
• Calibration standards for cocaine, benzoylecgonine, ecgonine
methyl ester, and norcocaine
6. PROCEDURE
Step A: Sample Preparation and Homogenization
1. Upon receipt, log the umbilical cord tissue sample into the
laboratory information system (LIS).
2. Assign a unique laboratory accession number to each
specimen.
3. Weigh approximately 1–5 grams of umbilical cord tissue using
an analytical balance and document the weight.
4. Homogenize the tissue using a bead mill or tissue grinder with
an appropriate volume of extraction solvent (typically methanol
or acetonitrile) to ensure thorough disruption.
5. Transfer the homogenized sample to a labeled microcentrifuge
tube.
Step B: Extraction
1. Add internal standard to each sample homogenate.
2. Vortex the sample for 1-2 minutes to ensure thorough mixing.
3. Centrifuge the samples at high speed (e.g., 10,000 rpm) for 10
minutes to precipitate proteins and other particulates.
4. Carefully pipette the supernatant into a clean labeled vial
without disturbing the pellet.
5. If necessary, perform a cleanup step using solid-phase
extraction (SPE) or liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) to enhance
sample purity.
Step C: Calibration and Quality Control
1. Prepare calibration standards at different concentrations
covering the expected range of analysis.
2. Analyze calibration standards and quality control samples (low,
medium, high) to ensure instrument performance and accuracy.
3. Construct a calibration curve by plotting the peak area ratio of
analyte to internal standard versus concentration.
Step D: Instrument Operation
1. Set up the LC-MS/MS system according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
2. Ensure that the mobile phase, system suitability standards, and
other reagents are properly prepared and loaded.
3. Optimize the mass spectrometer settings, including ion source
conditions, collision energy, and multiple reaction monitoring
(MRM) transitions for each analyte and internal standard.
4. Inject a portion of the sample extract into the LC-MS/MS
system.
Step E: Data Analysis and Reporting
1. Analyze the chromatographic data to identify and quantify
cocaine and its metabolites based on retention times and MRM
transitions.
2. Calculate the concentration of each analyte by comparing the
sample's peak area ratio to the calibration curve.
3. Document all results and observations accurately in the LIS.
4. Review and verify the results, ensuring that all quality control
parameters are met.
5. Generate a final report for each sample, including the
concentrations of cocaine and its metabolites, and release the
results to the ordering physician.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Analyze blank, negative, and positive control samples with every
batch of specimens.
• Review QC results to ensure they fall within acceptable ranges
before proceeding with sample analysis.
• Reanalyze any samples with outlying QC results and document
corrective actions taken.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
This procedure is specific to umbilical cord tissue and may not be
directly applicable to other matrices. Refer to the LC-MS/MS system
and reagent supplier documentation for any additional limitations or
troubleshooting steps.
