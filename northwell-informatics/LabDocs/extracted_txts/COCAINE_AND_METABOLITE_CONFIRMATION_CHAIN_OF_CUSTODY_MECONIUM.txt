Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Cocaine and Metabolite
Confirmation Testing in Meconium Samples
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedure for confirming the
presence of cocaine and its metabolites in meconium samples using
chain of custody protocols. This SOP ensures reliable, accurate, and
legally defensible results.
1. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory staff responsible for
performing cocaine and metabolite confirmation in meconium
samples.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
• Laboratory staff are responsible for performing and documenting
the testing procedure.
• Supervisors are responsible for oversight and ensuring
compliance with this SOP, including proper execution of chain of
custody protocols.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred Specimen:
• Minimum of 5 grams Meconium specimen.
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Specimen contaminated with foreign substances.
• Specimen lacking proper collection, receipt, and accession
documentation.
Specimen Storage:
• Specimens should be stored at -20°C prior to analysis.
1. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• Specific Reagents for Cocaine Metabolite Confirmation
• Chain of Custody Forms
• Meconium Collection Kits
• Analytical Instruments for Identification and Confirmation
• Protective Equipment (Gloves, Lab coat, Eye protection)
1. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Preparation:
i) Verify the specimen condition and documentation upon receipt. ii)
Document any discrepancies and report them to the supervisor. iii) If
specimen integrity and documentation are verified, proceed to thaw
the specimen at room temperature.
B. Chain of Custody Protocols:
i) Ensure chain of custody forms are filled out at each point of
specimen handling. ii) Transfer specimen to secure area for testing,
ensuring documentation follows specimen. iii) Log all points of
access to the specimen in the laboratory information system (LIS).
C. Analytical Procedure:
i) Prepare reagents and calibrate instruments according to
manufacturer specifications. ii) Weigh 2 grams of meconium and
homogenize thoroughly. iii) Perform sample extraction using validated
methods specific for cocaine and its metabolites. iv) Inject the extract
into the analytical instrument (e.g., GC-MS/MS). v) Analyze data
using instrument software to confirm the presence of cocaine and
metabolites.
D. Quality Control and Validation:
i) Run Quality Control (QC) samples alongside patient samples to
ensure assay accuracy. ii) Validate results against known standards
and QC samples. iii) Document QC results and any corrective actions
taken.
E. Reporting of Results:
i) Review and verify results. ii) Confirm positive results by re-analysis
and comparison against control samples. iii) Report confirmed results
into LIS. iv) Document all results and any pertinent observations in
the laboratory report.
Critical Results:
• Any detection of cocaine or its metabolites should be immediately
documented and reported.
• Follow your institution’s protocol for reporting critical values.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions for analytical instruments.
• Regulatory guidelines for chain of custody and specimen
handling.
• Published literature on cocaine metabolite testing in meconium.
1. LIMITATIONS
• Sample integrity can be compromised if not stored properly.
• Cross-contamination must be avoided to ensure the accuracy of
results.
1. DOCUMENTATION AND RECORD KEEPING
Maintain detailed records for all specimens, including chain of
custody forms, QC data, results, and any corrective actions taken.
Ensure data are stored securely and are accessible for verification
and review.
1. TRAINING
All personnel performing this procedure must be trained and
proficient in the operation of the analytical instruments, chain of
custody protocols, and specimen handling. Training records should
be maintained and regularly updated.
By adhering to this SOP, laboratory staff will ensure the reliable and
accurate confirmation of cocaine and its metabolites in meconium
samples, maintaining the integrity and legal defensibility of the
results.
