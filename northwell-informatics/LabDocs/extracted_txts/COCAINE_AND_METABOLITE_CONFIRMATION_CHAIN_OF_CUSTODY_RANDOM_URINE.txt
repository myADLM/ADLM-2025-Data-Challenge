Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Cocaine and Metabolite
Confirmation, Chain of Custody, Random, Urine
1. PURPOSE
To describe the procedure to confirm the presence of cocaine and its
metabolites in random urine samples, ensuring adherence to chain of
custody protocols and ensuring accurate and reliable results.
1. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel involved in the
analysis of urine samples for cocaine and its metabolites.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all designated laboratory personnel involved
in the analytical phase to follow this procedure correctly. The
laboratory supervisor is responsible for ensuring compliance with this
SOP.
1. DEFINITIONS
Cocaine Metabolites: Benzoylecgonine (BE) and Ecgonine Methyl
Ester (EME) Chain of Custody: Documentation and procedures which
ensure the integrity and traceability of a sample
1. EQUIPMENT & MATERIALS
• Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) or Liquid
Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)
• Urine specimen cups with tamper-evident seals
• Chain of Custody forms
• Reagents and standards for cocaine, benzoylecgonine, and
ecgonine methyl ester
• Pipettes
• Centrifuge
• Sample preparation vials
• Analytical balance
1. PROCEDURE
6.1 Specimen Preparation
1. Verify the integrity of the sample and chain of custody
documentation upon receipt.
2. Record the sample ID and condition in the laboratory logbook.
3. Refrigerate the urine sample at 2-8°C until analysis.
6.2 Sample Processing
1. Aliquot 5 mL of urine into a labeled centrifuge tube.
2. Add an appropriate internal standard to each urine sample,
standard, and control.
3. Vortex mix the samples for 30 seconds.
4. Centrifuge the samples at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes to separate
the particulates.
5. Transfer the supernatant to a clean vial for analysis.
6.3 Instrument Calibration and Quality Control
1. Prepare calibration standards for cocaine and its metabolites
(benzoylecgonine and ecgonine methyl ester) at various
concentrations.
2. Run the calibration standards on the GC-MS or LC-MS/MS to
generate a calibration curve.
3. Prepare and analyze quality control (QC) samples at low,
medium, and high concentrations.
4. Verify the instrument calibration and QC results meet the
acceptance criteria before analyzing the samples.
6.4 Sample Analysis
1. Load the prepared samples into the autosampler of the GC-MS
or LC-MS/MS.
2. Set the instrument parameters as per the manufacturer's
recommendations or existing validated method.
3. Inject the samples, calibrators, and QC samples into the
instrument.
4. Acquire and document the data and chromatograms for each
sample.
6.5 Data Analysis and Reporting
1. Analyze the chromatograms using appropriate software to
identify and quantify cocaine and its metabolites.
2. Ensure that the quantitative results are within the acceptable
range of the calibration curve.
3. Review all results for accuracy and compliance with laboratory
standards.
4. Enter the results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
5. Print and verify the results to ensure correct reporting.
6. Document any repeat analysis or anomalies noted during data
analysis.
6.6 Chain of Custody Protocol
1. Ensure that every individual handling the sample signs the
chain of custody form.
2. Maintain the chain of custody documentation with the samples
throughout the analytical process.
3. Retain all chain of custody records for a minimum of the legally
mandated period or as specified by the laboratory's protocol.
4. DOCUMENTATION
• Maintain records of all samples, reagents, calibration standards,
control samples, chain of custody forms, and analytical data.
• Ensure that all corrective actions taken are documented
appropriately.
• Report results according to the site-specific guidelines and
regulatory requirements.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's operational manuals for GC-MS/LC-MS/MS
equipment.
• Current version of relevant regulatory guidelines.
• Standard laboratory procedures and protocols for chain of
custody and toxicology analyses.
1. SAFETY
• Follow all applicable laboratory safety protocols, including the use
of personal protective equipment (PPE).
• Handle all chemicals and reagents according to the Material
Safety Data Sheets (MSDS).
• Properly dispose of all hazardous waste according to local, state,
and federal regulations.
1. REVIEW
This SOP will be reviewed annually or as needed by the laboratory
supervisor to ensure compliance with current analytical techniques
and regulatory standards.
