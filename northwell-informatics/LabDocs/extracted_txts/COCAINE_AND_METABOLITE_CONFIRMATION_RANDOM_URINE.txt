STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP) FOR ANALYSIS OF
COCAINE AND METABOLITE CONFIRMATION, RANDOM, URINE
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this SOP is to outline the process
and procedures for the analysis of cocaine and its metabolites
in random urine samples. This ensures accurate and reliable
results for confirmatory testing.
2. RESPONSIBILITY Designated laboratory staff are responsible
for performing the procedures outlined in this SOP. Laboratory
supervisors are responsible for ensuring staff adherence to this
protocol and for addressing any deviations or issues in the
process.
3. SCOPE This procedure applies to the analysis of urine samples
for cocaine and its metabolites (benzoylecgonine and ecgonine
methyl ester) confirmation using Gas Chromatography-Mass
Spectrometry (GC-MS) or Liquid Chromatography-Tandem
Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).
4. SPECIMEN INFORMATION
◦ Preferred Specimen: 10 mL random urine collected in a
clean, leakproof container.
◦ Unacceptable Specimens: Samples not labeled with the
patient’s name, samples with insufficient volume, specimens
received in non-sterile containers, or specimens with visible
contamination.
5. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
◦ Centrifuge
◦ GC-MS or LC-MS/MS Instrument
◦ Urine drug controls (positive and negative)
◦ Solid-phase extraction cartridges
◦ Mobile phase solvents (e.g., acetonitrile, methanol, water)
◦ Derivatization reagents (if using GC-MS)
◦ Internal standards (benzoylecgonine-d3, cocaine-d3)
◦ Calibrators and quality control materials
6. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation
◦ Ensure all instruments and equipment are calibrated and
functioning properly.
◦ Prepare all reagents and solvents according to
manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Perform quality control tests to ensure the reliability of the
assay.
B. Sample Preparation
◦ Centrifuge the urine sample at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes to
remove particulate matter.
◦ Transfer 5 mL of the supernatant to a clean test tube.
C. Extraction
◦ Add the internal standard to the urine sample.
◦ Perform solid-phase extraction (SPE) using SPE cartridges:
1. Condition the cartridge with 1 mL of methanol followed
by 1 mL of deionized water.
2. Load the urine sample onto the cartridge.
3. Wash the cartridge with 1 mL of deionized water
followed by 1 mL of 0.1 M acetic acid.
4. Elute the analytes with 1 mL of methanol into a clean
collection tube.
D. Analysis
◦ For GC-MS:
1. Dry the eluted sample under nitrogen at 40°C.
2. Reconstitute the residue with 100 µL of derivatization
reagent.
3. Inject 1 µL of the derivatized sample into the GC-MS.
◦ For LC-MS/MS:
1. Dilute the eluted sample with the mobile phase.
2. Inject 10 µL of the diluted sample into the LC-MS/MS.
E. Data Acquisition and Analysis
◦ Set the instrument parameters according to the established
method for cocaine and metabolites.
◦ Acquire data for the specific retention times and ion
transitions of cocaine, benzoylecgonine, and ecgonine
methyl ester.
◦ Ensure peak integration and quantification are performed
correctly.
◦ Compare the sample results with the calibration curve and
control values.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Run positive and negative controls with each batch of
samples.
◦ Verify that quality control results are within acceptable
ranges before releasing patient results.
◦ Follow standard QC procedures to accept or reject runs.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ Calculate the concentration of cocaine and its metabolites in
the sample.
◦ Record results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
for review and verification by a qualified technologist.
◦ Report any results that fall outside the reference ranges or
exhibit interference with appropriate comments.
9. REFERENCE INTERVALS
◦ Cocaine: < Limit of Quantitation (LOQ)
◦ Benzoylecgonine: < LOQ
◦ Ecgonine methyl ester: < LOQ
10. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to instrument vendor manuals and manufacturer
instructions for specific limitations.
• Interferences from other substances in the urine may affect the
accuracy of results.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions for the GC-MS or LC-MS/MS
equipment.
• Standard references for urine drug testing and confirmation
procedures.
Note: This SOP should be reviewed and updated regularly to ensure
compliance with current standards and procedures. All staff should be
trained on this SOP prior to performing the analysis.
