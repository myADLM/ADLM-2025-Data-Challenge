Standard Operating Procedure for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for COCAINE METABOLITE, URINE
1. Purpose
To provide a standardized procedure for the analytical phase of
testing urine samples for cocaine metabolite. This procedure ensures
accurate and reliable results.
2. Scope
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel involved in the
analytical phase of urine testing for cocaine metabolite.
3. Responsibilities
Laboratory personnel are responsible for following this procedure in
its entirety. Supervisors must ensure proper training for staff and
adherence to the procedure.
4. Specimen Requirements
• Preferred/Acceptable:
◦ 30-60 mL freshly voided urine collected in a clean container
without preservatives.
◦ Specimens must be sent to the laboratory within 24 hours of
collection. If the specimen is to be stored, refrigerate at 2-8°C
and store up to 72 hours.
• Unacceptable:
◦ Specimens arriving more than 24 hours after collection without
refrigeration.
◦ Specimens without collection date/time indicated.
◦ Specimens in preservatives or unclean containers.
5. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies
• Equipment:
◦ Automated urine analyzer such as the analyzer model used for
drug screening.
◦ Refrigerator for storing samples.
• Reagents and Supplies:
◦ Urine drug screening kits
◦ Pipettes
◦ Centrifuge (if applicable)
◦ Calibration standards
◦ Control materials (positive and negative)
6. Procedure
A) Sample Preparation:
1. Upon receiving the urine samples, ensure proper labeling and
identification.
2. If samples are refrigerated, bring them to room temperature
before analysis.
3. Mix the sample well.
B) Calibration and Quality Control:
1. Calibrate the urine analyzer daily before testing patient
samples. Follow instrument-specific calibration procedures.
2. Run quality controls (QC) at the beginning of each shift –
include both positive and negative controls.
3. Record calibration and QC results in the QC log. Investigate
and resolve any QC failures before proceeding with patient
samples.
C) Testing Procedure:
1. Loading the Specimen:
◦ Load the specimen onto the analyzer following the
manufacturer's instructions.
◦ Ensure the sample is properly loaded without contamination.
2. Analyzing the Specimen:
◦ Select the appropriate testing method for cocaine metabolite
on the analyzer.
◦ Start the analysis by following the on-screen prompts and
instructions provided by the analyzer.
◦ Record the time and initials of the person conducting the
test.
3. Result Verification:
◦ Once the analysis is complete, review the results on the
analyzer.
◦ Verify that the analyzer has flagged no errors during the
testing phase.
D) Post-Analysis:
1. Documenting Results:
◦ Review the results according to laboratory protocols.
◦ If the result is positive, document the finding and inform the
supervisor immediately.
2. Reporting Results:
◦ Transmit results electronically to the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
◦ Ensure that all results are reviewed and verified by the
technologist before final reporting.
◦ Report critical results following the critical results protocol.
3. Handling Positive Results:
◦ If the result is positive for cocaine metabolite, retest the
sample for confirmation.
◦ If confirmed, contact the ordering physician and adhere to
the laboratory's reporting guidelines for critical values.
4. Sample Retention:
◦ Store positive specimens refrigerated at 2-8°C for up to two
weeks for possible retesting or further analysis.
◦ Store negative specimens for 24 hours before disposal
following biohazard regulations.
7. Quality Control
• Materials:
◦ External cocaine metabolite controls
• Storage:
◦ Store QCs at 2-8°C.
• Procedure:
◦ Run and document QC for each new lot of testing kits or
reagents.
◦ Investigate any QC failures, and do not proceed with patient
sample testing until resolved.
8. Method Limitations
Refer to the manufacturer's insert for the analyzer and reagent
limitations. Be aware that certain substances may interfere with test
results.
