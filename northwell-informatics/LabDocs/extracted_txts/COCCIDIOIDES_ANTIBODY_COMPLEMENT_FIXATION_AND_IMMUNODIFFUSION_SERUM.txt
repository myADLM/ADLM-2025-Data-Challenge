Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for
COCCIDIOIDES ANTIBODY, COMPLEMENT FIXATION
AND IMMUNODIFFUSION, SERUM Analysis
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to provide standardized procedures for
the laboratory analysis of coccidioides antibody in serum using
complement fixation (CF) and immunodiffusion (ID) methodologies.
This SOP ensures consistent, accurate, and reliable results.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all personnel involved in the testing of
patient serum samples for coccidioides antibodies using the CF and
ID methods in the laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Laboratory technologists are responsible for performing the assay
according to the procedure.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring personnel are trained
and following the SOP.
• Laboratory management is responsible for providing necessary
resources and ensuring the quality assurance aspects of this SOP
are adhered to.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Acceptable Specimen Type: Serum, free of hemolysis and
lipemia.
• Volume Required: Minimum of 1 ml of serum.
• Specimen Integrity: Specimens must be centrifuged and
separated as soon as possible and should be stored at 2-8°C if
analysis is delayed, for no longer than 72 hours. For longer
storage, specimens should be frozen at -20°C or below.
5. REAGENTS AND MATERIALS
• Complement fixation reagents: guinea pig complement, antigen
(coccidioides standardized), sheep red blood cells, and
hemolysin.
• Immunodiffusion reagents: commercial coccidioides antigen
preparations and standard controls.
• Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)
• Plates for immunodiffusion
• Test tubes
• Pipettes and tips
• Incubator set to 37°C
• Centrifuge
6. PROCEDURE
A. Complement Fixation (CF):
1. Antigen Preparation:
◦ Prepare the coccidioides antigen according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
2. Serum Inactivation:
◦ Heat inactivate patient serum at 56°C for 30 minutes to
destroy any native complement present.
3. Titration of Complement:
◦ Perform a titration of guinea pig complement to determine
the optimal working dilution.
4. Test Setup:
◦ Dilute inactivated patient serum in PBS for the test.
◦ Add antigen to appropriately diluted serum samples and
controls.
◦ Add guinea pig complement to each tube.
◦ Incubate at 37°C for 30 minutes.
5. Indicator System:
◦ Prepare a 2% solution of sensitized sheep red blood cells.
◦ Add the indicator system to each tube, mix gently.
6. Reading Results:
◦ Incubate at 37°C for 30-60 minutes.
◦ Examine for hemolysis. A lack of hemolysis indicates the
presence of coccidioides antibodies (positive result).
Hemolysis indicates absence of antibodies (negative result).
◦ Titrate sera to determine endpoint (highest dilution showing
no hemolysis).
B. Immunodiffusion (ID):
1. Antigen Preparation:
◦ Prepare the coccidioides antigen according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
2. Gel Preparation:
◦ Prepare the agar gel plates according to the manufacturer's
instructions. Allow the gel to solidify.
3. Application of Samples:
◦ Apply patient serum and control samples into the wells, with
antigen directly across in the adjacent wells.
4. Incubation:
◦ Incubate the plates in a humidified chamber at 37°C for
24-48 hours, as directed.
5. Reading Results:
◦ Examine the gel plates for the presence of precipitin lines.
◦ The formation of a precipitin line between the sample and
antigen wells indicates a positive reaction.
◦ Record the presence or absence of precipitin lines.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Utilize positive and negative control sera with each run to ensure
the accuracy of the test procedures.
• Document any deviations from established procedures and
perform troubleshooting as needed.
• Analyze results of controls first to validate run before reporting
patient results.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Complement Fixation: Report the highest dilution of serum
showing no hemolysis as the titer.
• Immunodiffusion: Report the presence or absence of precipitin
lines.
9. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's instruction manuals for the respective reagents
and kits.
• Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines for
serological testing.
10. RECORD KEEPING
• Maintain records of reagent lot numbers, expiration dates, QC
results, patient results, and any deviations or corrective actions
taken.
• Document and store records according to laboratory data
retention policies.
11. SAFETY PRECAUTIONS
• Utilize personal protective equipment (PPE) as mandated by the
laboratory safety protocols.
• Handle all biological specimens with care and dispose of
biohazard materials according to regulations.
This SOP ensures uniform, reliable testing for coccidioides
antibodies, aiding in the diagnosis and management of
coccidioidomycosis. The procedure is to be reviewed annually and
amended as needed based on technological advancements and
procedural updates.
