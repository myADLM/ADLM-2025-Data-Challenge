Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for COCCIDIOIDES ANTIBODY,
COMPLEMENT FIXATION AND IMMUNODIFFUSION, SPINAL
FLUID
1. Purpose
This procedure ensures accurate and reliable performance in
detecting Coccidioides antibodies through Complement Fixation (CF)
and Immunodiffusion (ID) tests in spinal fluid samples.
1. Specimen
Specimen Type: Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF)
Specimen Collection and Handling:
• Cerebrospinal fluid should be collected according to standard
lumbar puncture procedures.
• Aliquot 1-2 mL of CSF into sterile containers.
• Specimens should be labeled with the patient's identification,
date, and time of collection.
• Store specimens at 2-8°C if analysis is delayed. Frozen
specimens should be avoided if possible to prevent protein
denaturation.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens with visible contamination.
• Specimens with evidence of clot formation.
• Specimens not properly labeled or lacking required patient
information.
1. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies
• Complement Fixation test kit
• Immunodiffusion test kit
• 0.85% Saline solution
• Complement source (often guinea pig serum)
• Hemolysin (antibody-sensitized reagent red cells)
• Calibrated pipettes
• Test tubes and racks
• Incubator
• Quantitative precipitin plates
• Sterile tips
• Timer
• Personal protective equipment (gloves, lab coat, etc.)
1. Procedure
A. Complement Fixation (CF)
1. Preparation:
◦ Warm all reagents and specimens to room temperature
before beginning the test.
◦ Prepare the hemolysin reagent by reconstituting it in the
appropriate solvent as per manufacturer's instructions.
2. CF Reaction Setup:
◦ Label the test tubes appropriately.
◦ For each specimen and control, add 0.1 mL of CSF into the
test tube.
◦ Add 0.1 mL of complement source.
◦ Add 0.1 mL of a 1:2 dilution of specific Coccidioides antigen
to each tube.
◦ Mix gently and incubate at 37°C for 30 minutes.
3. Addition of Hemolysin:
◦ After the incubation period, add 0.1 mL of pre-prepared
hemolysin to each test tube.
◦ Mix gently and return the tubes to the 37°C incubator for an
additional 30-60 minutes.
4. Reading and Interpretation:
◦ Record the results based on the degree of hemolysis.
◦ Complete hemolysis indicates a negative reaction.
◦ Partial or no hemolysis indicates a positive reaction
requiring further quantitation.
B. Immunodiffusion (ID)
1. Preparation:
◦ Prepare the quantitative precipitin plates with agar
containing specific Coccidioides antigens.
◦ Warm the CSF specimens to room temperature.
2. ID Test Setup:
◦ Dispense 10 μL of CSF into the designated wells on the ID
plate.
◦ Dispense control antiserum into adjacent wells as per
manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Allow the plate to equilibrate in a moist chamber at room
temperature.
3. Incubation:
◦ Incubate the plates at room temperature for 24-48 hours
undisturbed.
4. Reading and Interpretation:
◦ Examine the plate for precipitin lines indicating antigen-
antibody reactions.
◦ Record the presence and intensity of the precipitin lines.
◦ Positive ID results show the presence of one or more
precipitin lines.
5. Quality Control
• Use positive and negative controls for both CF and ID tests.
• Record control results alongside patient results for each test run.
• Repeat tests if controls do not perform as expected.
1. Reporting Results
• Use laboratory information system (LIS) to document all results.
• Results should be reviewed and verified by a qualified
technologist.
• Positive or equivocal results should be confirmed and reported
with additional comments.
