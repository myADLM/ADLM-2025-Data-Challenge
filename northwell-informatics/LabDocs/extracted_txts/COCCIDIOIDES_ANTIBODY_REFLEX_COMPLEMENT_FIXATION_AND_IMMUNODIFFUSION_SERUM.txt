Coccidioides Antibody Reflex, Complement Fixation and
Immunodiffusion, Serum: Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this protocol is to outline the procedures for the
analysis of Coccidioides antibody reflex including complement
fixation (CF) and immunodiffusion (ID) in serum specimens in order
to ensure accurate and reliable results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
Laboratory Technologists performing the analysis are responsible for
following this SOP. Laboratory Supervisors are responsible for
ensuring compliance with the procedure, reviewing results, and
implementing corrective actions if necessary.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type: Serum
Preferred Volume: 1 mL
Minimum Volume: 0.5 mL
Specimen Stability: Refrigerated at 2-8°C for up to 48 hours, or
frozen at -20°C for extended storage.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Grossly hemolyzed, lipemic, or contaminated samples
• Specimens collected in inappropriate containers
• Insufficient volume
4. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Complement Fixation assay kit
• Immunodiffusion kit
• Microtiter plates
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Incubator
• Centrifuge
• Refrigerator
• Freezer
• Vortex mixer
5. PROCEDURE
A) INITIAL SEROLOGICAL ANALYSIS
• Perform a screening serological test for Coccidioides antibodies
using an enzyme immunoassay (EIA) or enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
B) REFLEX TESTING If the initial serological test is positive, proceed
with the following reflex tests:
i. Complement Fixation (CF) Assay:
1. Preparation
◦ Prepare reagents as per manufacturer instructions.
◦ Dilute the serum sample and control sera with complement
fixation diluent.
2. Procedure
◦ Dispense diluted serum and control sera into appropriate
wells of a microtiter plate.
◦ Add control antigen and complement to each well.
◦ Incubate plates at 37°C for 2 hours.
◦ Add sensitized sheep red blood cells to each well and
incubate at 37°C for 30 minutes.
3. Result Interpretation
◦ Observe reactions. Positive results will show no hemolysis
or reduced hemolysis.
◦ Titer interpretation is based on the highest dilution showing
50% hemolysis.
ii. Immunodiffusion (ID) Assay:
1. Preparation
◦ Prepare agarose gel according to the manufacturer’s
protocol.
◦ Pour the gel into gel plates and allow it to solidify.
◦ Punch wells into the gel using a well template.
2. Procedure
◦ Add patient serum to designated wells.
◦ Load control antigens and positive and negative controls
into respective wells.
◦ Incubate plates in a humidified chamber at room
temperature for 24-48 hours.
3. Result Interpretation
◦ Examine plates for precipitin lines indicating the presence of
Coccidioides antibodies.
◦ Compare and interpret against controls. Positive results will
show distinct precipitin lines between control antigen wells
and patient serum wells.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run positive and negative controls with each batch of tests.
• Document all control results, ensuring that they fall within
acceptable ranges.
• If control results are out of range, do not release patient results.
Investigate and correct any issues before re-testing.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Positive results from the screening test and reflex tests are
reported as positive for Coccidioides antibodies, with titers
provided where relevant.
• Negative reflex test results after an initially positive screening test
are reported as inconclusive, recommending repeat testing or
further clinical correlation.
8. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s inserts and instructions for the specific kits used.
• Relevant clinical and laboratory standards guidelines (e.g.,
Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines).
9. DOCUMENTATION
Ensure that all testing, including controls run, patient information, and
results, along with any corrective actions taken, are documented in
accordance with the laboratory's documentation policies.
By adhering to this SOP, the laboratory aims to ensure reliable,
consistent, and reproducible results for the detection and
quantification of Coccidioides antibodies in serum through
Complement Fixation and Immunodiffusion testing.
