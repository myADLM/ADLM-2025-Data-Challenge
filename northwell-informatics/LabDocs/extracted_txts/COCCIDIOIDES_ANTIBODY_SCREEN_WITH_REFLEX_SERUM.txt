STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP) Title: Coccidioides
Antibody Screen with Reflex, Serum
1. PURPOSE To provide precise, reproducible, and accurate
results for the detection of antibodies against Coccidioides
species in patient serum samples by using enzyme
immunoassay (EIA). This protocol outlines the procedures
performed after specimen collection through to the generation
and verification of results, including reflex testing if the initial
screen is positive.
2. RESPONSIBILITY Laboratory Scientists and Technicians are
responsible for performing the steps outlined in this procedure.
Supervisors must ensure that staff are trained and adhere to
this SOP. All personnel must follow these procedures to ensure
the integrity and validity of results including taking corrective
actions whenever necessary.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
◦ Preferred Specimen: Serum collected in a serum separator
tube (SST).
◦ Minimum Volume: 1 mL of serum.
◦ Sample Stability:
▪ Room Temperature (15-25°C): 48 hours
▪ Refrigerated (2-8°C): 14 days
▪ Frozen (-20°C or colder): 6 months
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
◦ Enzyme Immunoassay (EIA) Analyzer
◦ Coccidioides Antibody EIA Kits
◦ Quality Control (QC) Materials
◦ Calibrators
◦ Reagents specified by the EIA kit manufacturer
◦ Pipettes and Pipette Tips
◦ Test Tubes and Racks
◦ Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
5. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Perform internal QC using provided control materials at the
start and end of each batch.
◦ All QC results must fall within the defined acceptable ranges
before patient testing results are released.
◦ Document all QC results, maintenance, and calibration
activities in the QC log.
6. PROCEDURE
A) Specimen Preparation
◦ Allow the serum sample to clot and then centrifuge
according to the manufacturer's instructions.
◦ Verify sample integrity; reject hemolyzed, lipemic, or
contaminated specimens.
◦ Aliquot a suitable volume for testing if required.
B) Initial EIA Testing
◦ Label all tubes and wells appropriately.
◦ Set up and calibrate the EIA analyzer.
◦ Follow the manufacturer's instructions to prepare the
reagent, calibrator, and QC materials.
◦ Pipette the specified volumes of serum, controls, and
reagents into corresponding wells on the EIA plate.
◦ Run the EIA assay according to the manufacturer's protocol,
ensuring proper incubation times, washes, and analysis via
the EIA analyzer.
◦ Record the absorbance values and concentrations obtained.
C) Evaluation of Initial Results
◦ Calculate and interpret the results as per the cut-off values
provided in the kit’s instructions.
◦ Negative: No significant levels of antibodies detected.
◦ Positive/Equivocal: Perform reflex testing to confirm.
D) Reflex Testing (Confirmatory Test)
◦ Positive/Elevated results must go through a confirmatory
test such as a Coccidioides immunodiffusion (ID) test or
Complement Fixation (CF).
◦ Prepare and run the confirmatory test as described in the
corresponding test kit.
◦ Interpret the confirmatory test as per standard guidelines.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ Input all patient results into the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
◦ Confirm and verify results following site-specific guidelines
before releasing.
◦ Document critical results and notify the appropriate
physician or clinic immediately.
◦ Reflex results must be included in the final report with notes
explaining the confirmatory testing performed and outcome.
8. REFERENCE INTERVALS
◦ Negative: No detectable antibodies
◦ Positive: Indicates presence of Coccidioides antibodies
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
◦ EIA results must be interpreted within the context of the
clinical presentation of the patient.
◦ False-positive results due to cross-reactivity or non-specific
binding can occur and hence confirmatory tests should be
performed for all initially positive results.
