COCCIDIOIDES IMMITIS/POSADASII MOLECULAR DETECTION
SOP
1. PURPOSE This SOP details the steps required for the
molecular detection of Coccidioides immitis/posadasii in
paraffin-embedded tissue sections using PCR. This includes
sample preparation, DNA extraction, PCR amplification, and
result analysis.
2. SCOPE This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel
responsible for performing PCR-based molecular detection of
Coccidioides immitis/posadasii in paraffin-embedded tissue
samples.
3. RESPONSIBILITY Trained laboratory personnel are
responsible for performing the procedures as outlined, ensuring
accuracy and preventing contamination. It is the responsibility
of the supervisor to ensure that staff are trained and competent
in these procedures and that all equipment is functioning and
properly maintained.
4. EQUIPMENT, MATERIALS, AND REAGENTS
◦ Microtome
◦ Sterile scalpel blades
◦ Parafilm
◦ Xylene
◦ Ethanol (100%, 95%, 70%)
◦ Nuclease-free water
◦ DNA extraction kit (validated for paraffin-embedded tissues)
◦ PCR reagents: primers, Taq polymerase, dNTPs, and
buffers
◦ Thermal cycler
◦ Agarose gel electrophoresis setup
◦ Ethidium bromide or alternative DNA stain
◦ Gel documentation system
◦ Positive control DNA (Coccidioides immitis/posadasii)
◦ Negative control (Nuclease-free water)
5. PROCEDURE A. Sample Preparation 1. Cut 5-10 micron thick
sections from the paraffin-embedded tissue block using a
microtome. 2. Place the sections in a microcentrifuge tube. 3.
Treat the sections with xylene to remove paraffin: a. Add 1 ml of
xylene to the tube and mix by vortexing. b. Incubate at room
temperature for 10 minutes. c. Centrifuge at 14,000 rpm for 5
minutes and discard the supernatant. d. Repeat xylene
treatment once. e. Wash the pellet twice with 1 ml of 100%
ethanol, centrifuging and discarding the supernatant each time.
f. Wash once with 1 ml of 95% ethanol and once with 70%
ethanol. g. Allow the pellet to air dry briefly.
B. DNA Extraction 4. Extract DNA from the deparaffinized tissue
sections using the validated DNA extraction kit, following the
manufacturer’s instructions. 5. Elute the DNA in nuclease-free
water or the elution buffer provided with the kit and store at
-20°C until PCR analysis.
C. PCR Amplification 6. Prepare the PCR master mix on ice: a.
1X PCR buffer b. 200 µM dNTPs c. 0.5 µM forward primer d.
0.5 µM reverse primer e. 1.5 mM MgCl2 f. 1 unit Taq
polymerase g. 2-5 µl of extracted DNA template h. Nuclease-
free water to complete the final volume (usually 50 µl) 7.
Include a positive control (known Coccidioides immitis/
posadasii DNA) and a negative control (nuclease-free water) in
each run. 8. Set the thermal cycler with the following conditions:
a. Initial denaturation at 95°C for 5 minutes b. 35 cycles of i.
Denaturation at 95°C for 30 seconds ii. Annealing (appropriate
temperature for specific primers, usually 55-60°C) for 30
seconds iii. Extension at 72°C for 45 seconds c. Final extension
at 72°C for 7 minutes 9. Hold at 4°C until samples are removed.
D. Post-PCR Analysis 10. Prepare a 1.5% agarose gel with
ethidium bromide or an alternative DNA stain. 11. Load 5-10 µl
of PCR products mixed with loading dye into each well. Include
a molecular weight marker. 12. Run the gel at 100V for 45-60
minutes. 13. Visualize the PCR products under UV light and
document the results using a gel documentation system.
6. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
◦ A positive result will show a distinct band at the expected
size for Coccidioides immitis/posadasii.
◦ The positive control should show a band at the expected
size.
◦ The negative control should show no bands.
◦ Any discrepant or unusual bands should be reported and
discussed with the supervisor before finalizing the results.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Include both positive and negative controls in each PCR
run.
◦ Ensure all reagents are within their expiration dates and
stored properly.
◦ Perform regular maintenance and calibration on the thermal
cycler and electrophoresis equipment.
◦ Maintain a clean and contamination-free workspace,
especially during PCR setup.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ Document results in the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
◦ Ensure that proper documentation of controls and
observations accompany the patient results.
◦ Positive or inconclusive results should be verified by a
second technologist.
