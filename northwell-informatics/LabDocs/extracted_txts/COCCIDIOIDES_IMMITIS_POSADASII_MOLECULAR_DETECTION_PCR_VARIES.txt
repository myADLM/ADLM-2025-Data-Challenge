Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Coccidioides immitis/posadasii Detection via
PCR
1. PURPOSE To outline the procedure for the molecular detection
of Coccidioides immitis/posadasii using PCR (Polymerase
Chain Reaction) to ensure accurate, reliable, and timely results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY Laboratory technologists and scientists are
responsible for performing the PCR assay, ensuring the correct
handling and processing of specimens, maintaining equipment,
and validating and recording results. Supervisors are
responsible for overseeing the process and ensuring adherence
to the procedure.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS Specimens suitable for the
detection of Coccidioides immitis/posadasii include:
• Respiratory specimens (sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage,
bronchial washings)
• Tissue biopsies
• Other specimens as determined by the clinician
Specimens should be stored at 2-8°C and processed within 24 hours
of collection. If a delay in processing is anticipated, specimens may
be stored at -70°C for up to one month.
1. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• PCR reagents (e.g., DNA extraction kit, primers/probes specific
for Coccidioides immitis/posadasii)
• Molecular grade water
• Positive and negative controls
• PCR master mix (enzymes, dNTPs, buffer)
• Sterile, nuclease-free tubes and pipette tips
• RTPCR instrument
1. EQUIPMENT
• PCR thermal cycler
• Microcentrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Pipettes
• Biosafety cabinet (Class II)
1. PROCEDURE A. Specimen Preparation
2. Verify that specimens are correctly labeled and match the
corresponding test requisition.
3. Use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) and work
under a biosafety cabinet to avoid contamination.
B. Nucleic Acid Extraction
1. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for the chosen DNA
extraction kit.
2. Include a negative extraction control (e.g., molecular grade
water) and a positive extraction control.
3. Measure DNA concentration and purity using a
spectrophotometer, if required.
C. PCR Setup
1. Thaw all reagents and samples on ice.
2. Prepare the PCR master mix according to the manufacturer’s
instructions, including primers/probes for Coccidioides immitis/
posadasii.
3. Aliquot the master mix into sterile, nuclease-free PCR tubes or
plates.
4. Add extracted DNA samples, positive control, and negative
control to the corresponding tubes or wells.
5. Seal the tubes or plate and briefly centrifuge to ensure all liquid
is at the bottom.
D. PCR Amplification
1. Place the tubes or plate in the PCR thermal cycler.
2. Program the thermal cycler with the following cycling
conditions: a. Initial denaturation at 95°C for 3 minutes b. 40
cycles of: i. Denaturation at 95°C for 15 seconds ii. Annealing/
extension at 60°C for 1 minute
3. Ensure the proper PCR cycling conditions are followed as
indicated by reagent and equipment manufacturers.
E. Result Analysis
1. Analyze the PCR results using the thermal cycler’s software.
2. Interpret the results by comparing the amplification curves of
the samples with those of the positive and negative controls.
◦ Positive samples will show a defined amplification curve.
◦ Negative samples will show no amplification.
◦ If amplification is observed in the negative control,
investigate for contamination and repeat the analysis.
3. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include positive and negative controls with each PCR run.
• Record control results and ensure they meet the acceptance
criteria.
• If controls are out of range, identify the potential error source and
repeat the assay.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Record results in the laboratory information system (LIS).
• Positive results should be reported as “Detected,” indicating the
presence of Coccidioides DNA.
• Negative results should be reported as “Not Detected.”
• Inconclusive results should be reported as “Inconclusive,” with
recommendations for repeat testing using a new specimen.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If PCR inhibitors are suspected, consider re-extracting DNA using
an alternative method.
• Conduct regular maintenance and performance checks on the
thermal cycler and other equipment.
• Review PCR setup and handling procedures to avoid
contamination.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions for the DNA extraction kit and PCR
reagents.
• Relevant laboratory SOPs for molecular diagnostics.
1. REVISION HISTORY
• Date and nature of revisions made to this SOP.
By following this SOP, laboratory personnel will ensure the reliable
detection of Coccidioides immitis/posadasii DNA, facilitating accurate
diagnosis and timely patient management.
