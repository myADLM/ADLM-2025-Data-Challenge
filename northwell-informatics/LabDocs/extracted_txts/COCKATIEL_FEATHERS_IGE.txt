Title: Analytical Phase Protocol for Generating Results for
COCKATIEL FEATHERS IGE
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for the analysis of Cockatiel Feathers
Immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels in patient serum samples using
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to ensure accurate
and reliable results.
Responsibility: The designated laboratory staff are responsible for
performing the analysis, documenting the process, and ensuring
corrective actions are taken as needed.
1. DEFINITIONS
Cockatiel Feathers IgE: Immunoglobulin E specific to allergens found
in cockatiel feathers.
1. PROCEDURE
A) EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
1. Microplate Reader capable of measuring absorbance at 450
nm.
2. Incubator set at 37°C.
3. Vortex mixer.
4. Microplate washing system.
5. Dedicated ELISA workstation.
6. ELISA kit for Cockatiel Feathers IgE, including: ○ Cockatiel
Feathers IgE antibody-coated microplates ○ Patient caliber
standards and controls ○ Washing buffer ○ Substrate solution ○
Stop solution ○ Sample diluent ○ Primary and secondary
antibodies
7. Pipettes and sterile pipette tips (20 µL, 100 µL, 200 µL, and
1000 µL).
8. Deionized water.
B) SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
1. Specimen Type: Serum
2. Volume: Minimum 200 µL of serum.
3. Collection: Serum should be collected in a red-top tube to allow
the clot to form and centrifuged to separate the clot from the
serum.
4. Handling: Specimens should be labeled and stored at 2-8°C if
the test is performed within 24 hours; otherwise, store at -20°C
or below until analysis.
5. Specimen Rejection: Hemolyzed, lipemic, or contaminated
specimens will not be accepted for testing.
C) PREPARATION
1. Ensure all reagents and specimens are brought to room
temperature (18-25°C) before starting the assay.
2. Prepare the washing buffer as per ELISA kit instructions.
3. Prepare a sample diluent.
4. Calibrate pipettes according to the lab standards.
5. Set up the ELISA workstation.
D) ELISA PROCEDURE
1. Sample Preparation: a. Dilute 100 µL of patient serum with 400
µL of sample diluent (1:5 dilution). b. Follow similar dilution
steps for calibrators and controls as provided in the ELISA kit.
2. Assay Procedure: a. Add 100 µL of sample diluent to blank
wells. b. Add 100 µL of each calibrator, control, and diluted
serum sample to the appropriate wells in duplicate. c. Incubate
the microplate at 37°C for 1 hour. d. Wash the plate three times
with 300 µL of washing buffer per well. e. Add 100 µL of the
primary antibody to each well, incubate the plate at 37°C for 30
minutes. f. Wash the plate three times with washing buffer. g.
Add 100 µL of secondary antibody conjugated to enzyme to
each well, incubate at 37°C for 30 minutes. h. Wash the plate
five times with washing buffer. i. Add 100 µL of the substrate
solution to each well, incubate at 37°C for 15 minutes in the
dark. j. Add 50 µL of stop solution to each well to stop the
reaction. k. Read the absorbance of each well at 450 nm using
a microplate reader within 15 minutes of adding the stop
solution.
3. Data Analysis: a. Calculate the mean absorbance for each set
of duplicate standards, controls, and samples. b. Construct a
standard curve by plotting the mean absorbance of each
calibrator against its known concentration. c. Determine the
concentration of Cockatiel Feathers IgE in each sample by
referring to the standard curve.
E) INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
1. Reference Values: a. Negative: < 0.35 kUA/L b. Borderline: 0.35
- 0.7 kUA/L c. Positive: > 0.7 kUA/L
2. Reporting: a. Report results in kUA/L. b. Include any necessary
clinical correlations in the result interpretation.
F) QUALITY CONTROL
1. Run quality control samples with each assay to validate the
results.
2. Evaluate each set of controls to ensure they fall within the
established range.
3. Document any deviations and implement corrective actions as
necessary.
G) TROUBLESHOOTING
1. Ensure that the plate reader and incubator are properly
calibrated.
2. Follow pipetting techniques precisely to avoid inconsistencies.
3. Repeat the wash steps as needed to ensure adequate washing
of wells.
4. Use freshly prepared substrates.
