1. PURPOSE
This protocol outlines the procedures for the analytical phase of
generating results for Cocklebur (Xanthium spp.), Immunoglobulin E
(IgE) levels in serum, ensuring accurate and reliable detection and
measurement of specific IgE related to Cocklebur allergen.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory technologists and personnel are responsible
for performing the procedures as specified in this protocol. It is also
their responsibility to document all steps taken and results obtained,
identify any deviations from the standard procedures, and notify
supervisors of any issues encountered.
1. DEFINITIONS
Cocklebur IgE (Immunoglobulin E): An antibody that plays a key role
in allergic responses. Elevated levels of IgE specific to Cocklebur
indicate sensitization to this allergen.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND HANDLING
Preferred Specimen:
• Serum collected in a serum separator tube (SST).
• Minimum volume required is 0.5 mL serum.
Specimen Stability:
• Specimen stable at 2-8°C for up to 48 hours.
• For longer storage, specimens should be aliquoted and frozen at
-20°C or lower.
• Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Automated Immunoassay Analyzer (e.g., ImmunoCAP analyzer)
• Cocklebur allergen-specific IgE assay kits
• Calibrators
• Quality control materials (negative and positive controls)
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation for Analysis
• Label all specimens clearly, ensuring patient identification and
specimen integrity are maintained.
• Thaw frozen specimens completely and mix thoroughly before
analysis.
• Check reagents and calibrators for expiry and ensure they match
the batch numbers specified in the assay kit.
B. Calibration
• Calibrate the analyzer according to the manufacturer's
instructions using the provided calibrators.
• Document calibration details, including date, time, and initials of
the performing technologist, in the calibration log.
C. Quality Control
• Run both negative and positive quality controls at the beginning of
each shift. Ensure controls are within the acceptable range
specified by the manufacturer.
• Document quality control results in the QC log. If results fall
outside the acceptable range, repeat the control run. If they
remain out of range, troubleshoot according to the manufacturer’s
guidelines and notify a supervisor.
D. Sample Analysis
• Load serum specimens onto the analyzer as per the instrument’s
capacity.
• Enter patient details and specimen identification numbers into the
system.
• Select the Cocklebur-specific IgE test protocol on the analyzer.
• Start the analysis according to the manufacturer's instructions.
• Monitor the assay run. Document any issues or abnormalities
encountered during the run.
E. Result Verification
• Review raw data and calculated IgE levels for each specimen.
• Compare results with the acceptable ranges and criteria provided
by the manufacturer. Any unexpected or abnormal results must be
re-checked and verified.
• In the case of inconsistencies, repeat the analysis using a fresh
aliquot of the same specimen.
• Annotate re-runs, issues, and any corrective actions taken in the
laboratory information system (LIS) or result verification log.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Report the results through the laboratory information system
(LIS). Ensure all processed results are reviewed and validated by
a qualified technologist before release.
• Any critical or significantly high IgE results should be flagged and
reported to the requesting physician promptly.
• Include a custom comment on any samples exhibiting
interference or needing special interpretation.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Ensure strict adherence to the manufacturer’s guidelines for
sample handling and preparation to avoid cross-reactivity or
sample degradation.
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples may affect the accuracy of
results and should be noted for potential re-collection.
