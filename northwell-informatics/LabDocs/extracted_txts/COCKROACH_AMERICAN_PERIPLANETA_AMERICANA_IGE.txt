Protocol for Analytical Phase: COCKROACH AMERICAN
(PERIPLANETA AMERICANA) IgE
1. PURPOSE
To provide accurate and reliable measurements of IgE antibodies
specific to the American Cockroach (Periplaneta americana) allergen
in patient serum samples.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing
and documenting the analytical procedures.
• All staff must identify any deficiencies in the analytical process
and notify the supervisor promptly.
1. DEFINITION
This SOP applies to the measurement of IgE antibodies specific to
the cockroach allergen (Periplaneta americana) using an
ImmunoCAP device or similar.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• ImmunoCAP system (Phadia AB)
• Cockroach (Periplaneta americana) allergen ImmunoCAP
reagents
• Calibrators and controls specific to the ImmunoCAP system
• Micropipettes and tips
• Serum sample tubes
• Laboratory timer
• Disposable gloves
• Deionized water
• Biohazard waste containers
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND HANDLING
Specimen Requirements:
• Type: Serum
• Volume: Minimum of 500 µL to allow for repeat testing if
necessary
Acceptable Samples:
• Serum samples should be collected in a standard sterile tube and
allowed to clot. The blood should then be centrifuged, and the
serum separated.
• Samples must be stored at 2-8°C if testing within 48 hours; for
longer storage, samples should be kept at -20°C or colder.
Unacceptable Samples:
• Samples with visible hemolysis, lipemia, or microbial
contamination
• Samples received without proper labeling or with incomplete
collection information
1. PROCEDURE
A. Calibration and Quality Control
1. Perform calibration with standards provided in the ImmunoCAP
kit, following the manufacturer's instructions.
2. Run positive and negative controls as specified.
3. Record quality control results in the quality control log and
verify their acceptability before proceeding with patient
samples. Out-of-range controls must be addressed with
troubleshooting steps as outlined in the instrument manual, and
re-testing must occur after necessary corrections.
B. Sample Analysis
1. Thaw serum samples if stored frozen and bring to room
temperature (18-25°C) before testing.
2. Vortex the serum samples gently to ensure homogeneity.
3. Load the serum samples, calibrators, controls, and
ImmunoCAP reagents onto the ImmunoCAP instrument trays.
4. Program the ImmunoCAP instrument according to the
manufacturer's protocol for COCKROACH AMERICAN
(PERIPLANETA AMERICANA) IgE.
5. Initiate the run and monitor the system for any errors or
warnings reported by the instrument.
6. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
Results are automatically calculated and expressed in kU/L by the
ImmunoCAP system.
Reference Intervals:
• <0.1 kU/L: Negative (No detectable IgE specific for American
cockroach)
• 0.1-0.35 kU/L: Borderline/Equivocal
• 0.35 kU/L: Positive (Detectable IgE specific for
American cockroach)
Note: Clinical correlation is required as the presence of IgE
antibodies does not necessarily indicate clinical allergy.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Verify results against quality control data. Accept or reject results
based on quality control outcomes.
• Record the verified results in the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
• Flag any critical values for immediate notification to the
appropriate healthcare provider as per laboratory protocol.
1. QUALITY CONTROL AND TROUBLESHOOTING
A. If quality control or calibration results fall outside the accepted
limits:
• Recalibrate the instrument.
• Repeat quality control tests.
• Check for potential reagent contamination.
• Perform routine maintenance as per instrument guidelines.
• Remove and inspect for potential clots, bubbles, or other
obstructions in sample/reagent lines.
B. If errors persist after troubleshooting, contact the instrument
manufacturer for technical support.
1. MAINTENANCE
• Follow the ImmunoCAP manufacturer’s maintenance schedule
and procedures.
• Perform routine instrument checks and document maintenance
activities in the maintenance log.
