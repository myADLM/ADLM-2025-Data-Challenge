Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase:
COCKROACH, IGE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE To outline the necessary steps required for the
analytical phase of generating results for the COCKROACH,
IGE, SERUM test.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory technologists are responsible
for performing the procedures outlined in this SOP and for
maintaining accurate and complete records of all analyses.
1. DEFINITION The COCKROACH, IGE, SERUM test quantifies
serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies specific to cockroach
allergens. The test is used to aid in the diagnosis of allergic
reactions to cockroach allergens.
2. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Requirements Preferred/Acceptable:
• Serum collected in an SST (serum separator tube) or red-top
tube.
• Minimum volume: 1 mL of serum.
• Specimens must be centrifuged and the serum separated within 2
hours of collection.
• Aliquot serum into a clean, labeled tube for analysis if needed.
Unacceptable:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
• Specimens submitted in tubes containing anticoagulants.
• Samples with insufficient volume.
• Specimens received more than 72 hours post-collection if not
refrigerated; specimens received more than 7 days post-collection
if refrigerated.
B. Equipment and Reagents
• Analyzer capable of conducting specific IgE tests (e.g.,
ImmunoCAP System).
• Cockroach allergen-specific IgE reagent cartridges.
• Pipettes and tips.
• Centrifuge.
• Serum separator tubes (SST) or red-top tubes.
• Calibrators and controls specific to the assay being performed.
• Personal protective equipment (PPE).
C. Reagent Handling and Storage
• Store all reagents according to the manufacturer's instructions.
• Do not use reagents past their expiration dates.
• Bring reagents to room temperature prior to use.
D. Calibration and Quality Control
• Calibrate the analyzer according to the manufacturer's
instructions before running patient specimens, typically upon lot
change or as recommended by the manufacturer.
• Run two levels of quality control (QC) materials (low and high) at
the beginning of each shift, with each new lot of reagent, and as
required by the laboratory's QC policies.
• Document all QC results in the appropriate log. QC must fall
within the acceptable range before patient samples are analyzed.
If the QC results are out of range, troubleshoot and resolve the
issue before proceeding.
E. Test Procedure
1. Prepare the analyzer, ensuring that it is calibrated, and QC
results are within acceptable limits.
2. Load the necessary cockroach allergen-specific IgE reagent
cartridge into the analyzer.
3. Label and prepare patient serum samples for analysis.
4. Pipette the required volume of patient serum into the
designated well or tube on the testing platform.
5. Follow the instrument and reagent manufacturer's instructions
for loading samples and initiating the test run.
6. Allow the analyzer to process the samples according to the
programmed assay parameters.
F. Results Verification and Reporting
1. Upon completion of the assay, review the generated results for
each patient sample.
2. Verify that the assay controls and calibrators are within
acceptable limits.
3. If results are flagged or outside the reportable range, repeat the
analysis if necessary, or troubleshoot the analyzer as needed.
4. Report the IgE concentration for cockroach allergens using the
laboratory information system (LIS).
5. Document all results, including any discrepancies or repeated
analyses, in the patient’s record.
6. Inform the clinician of any critical or significantly abnormal
findings in accordance with laboratory policy.
G. Reference Intervals
• Reference intervals are method-specific and should be provided
by the reagent manufacturer. Typical values:
◦ Negative: <0.35 kU/L
◦ Borderline: 0.35 - <0.70 kU/L
◦ Positive: ≥ 0.70 kU/L
H. Method Limitations
• Refer to the manufacturer's package insert for limitations specific
to the cockroach, IgE, serum assay.
• Results should be interpreted in conjunction with clinical findings
and other diagnostic tests.
1. SAFETY AND WASTE DISPOSAL
• Follow general laboratory safety protocols, including wearing
appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves,
lab coats, and eye protection.
• Dispose of all biohazardous waste in accordance with local and
federal regulations.
1. DOCUMENTATION
• Record the assay details, calibration data, QC results, and patient
results in the laboratory information system (LIS).
• Maintain records as per the laboratory’s document control
procedure.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions for the analyzer and reagents used.
• Laboratory’s Quality Control and Quality Assurance policies.
This SOP is effective as of the date of approval and must be
reviewed annually or whenever there is a change in procedure or
instrumentation.
