1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the procedures for the analytical phase of
generating test results for COCONUT, Immunoglobulin E (IGE), and
serum samples. The purpose is to ensure accuracy, consistency, and
reliability in test results and comply with relevant regulatory
requirements.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory staff responsible for analyzing
COCONUT, IGE, and serum samples in the CLIA-certified laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Laboratory Technologists: Perform analysis according to the
procedures and ensure proper documentation.
• Supervisors: Oversee the procedures and ensure compliance
with the protocol.
• Quality Control Personnel: Validate and monitor the accuracy
and precision of analytical methods.
4. DEFINITIONS
• COCONUT: A specified test or panel including coconut allergen
testing.
• IGE: Immunoglobulin E, measured for allergy testing.
• Serum: The clear fluid that can be separated from clotted blood
which contains no blood cells or clotting factors.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Spectrophotometer or automated chemiluminescence
immunoassay analyzer.
• Centrifuge.
• Incubators.
• Calibrated pipettes.
• Refrigerators.
Reagents:
• COCONUT allergen reagents as per manufacturer's instructions.
• IGE quantification reagents (e.g., ELISA or immunoassay kits).
• Serum test reagents including specified controls and calibrators.
Supplies:
• Personal protective equipment (PPE).
• Specimen collection and transport containers.
• Microcentrifuge tubes.
• Disposable gloves.
• Assay plates and corresponding plate readers.
6. PROCEDURES
6.1 Sample Preparation
1. COCONUT, IGE, Serum Samples
◦ Verify that samples are correctly labeled with patient details.
◦ Ensure samples are accessioned and documented in the
LIS (Laboratory Information System).
◦ Ensure serum samples are separated within 2 hours of
collection and stored at -20°C until analysis.
◦ Thaw frozen serum samples at room temperature before
analysis.
6.2 Analytical Procedures
A) COCONUT Allergen Testing
1. Preparation:
◦ Use specific allergen reagents for coconut testing as per
manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Prepare calibrators, controls, and patient samples for
analysis.
2. Procedure:
◦ Pipette required volumes of calibrators, controls, and
samples into designated wells of the assay plate.
◦ Follow the assay protocol for incubation, washing, and
detection steps.
◦ Measure absorbance using a spectrophotometer at the
specified wavelength.
3. Calculation:
◦ Plot a standard curve using calibrators.
◦ Determine the concentrations of allergens in patient
samples from the standard curve.
B) IGE Quantification
1. Preparation:
◦ Use reagents from the IGE quantification kit.
◦ Prepare all necessary calibrators and controls, using sample
dilutions as required.
2. Procedure:
◦ Pipette samples, calibrators, and controls into assay plates.
◦ Incubate, wash, and develop the reaction as per the kit
instructions.
◦ Read the plate on a suitable chemiluminescence or ELISA
reader.
3. Calculation:
◦ Generate a standard curve from the calibrators.
◦ Determine IGE levels in patient samples against the curve.
C) Serum Analysis
1. Preparation:
◦ Check for specific test requirements and collect reagents
and equipment required.
◦ Process calibrators and controls as needed per test
protocol.
2. Procedure:
◦ Perform assays using the selected automated or manual
methodology (e.g., biochemical assays for specific
analytes).
◦ Incubate and measure according to test-specific protocols.
3. Calculation:
◦ Utilize standard curves where necessary or direct
quantitation from analyzers.
◦ Record findings in the LIS.
6.3 Quality Control
• Analyze control samples with each batch to ensure validity.
• If control results fall outside of acceptable limits, troubleshoot and
reprocess as needed.
• Keep detailed logs of all control runs, calibrator checks, and
maintenance work.
6.4 Results Interpretation and Reporting
• Verify generated results and compare against reference ranges
provided in test kits.
• Enter validated results into LIS.
• Review any abnormal or critical results per laboratory protocols.
• Falsified or suspicious results should be investigated and
repeated if necessary.
