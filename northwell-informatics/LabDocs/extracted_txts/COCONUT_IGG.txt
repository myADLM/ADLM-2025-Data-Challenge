Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for COCONUT IGG
Analysis
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to describe the procedures for the
analysis of COCONUT IGG (Immunoglobulin G) in patient
specimens. This includes detailed instructions for the handling,
processing, and analysis of samples to ensure accurate and reliable
results.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all staff members who are responsible for
the analysis of COCONUT IGG in the laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
Laboratory technologists are responsible for performing the analysis
according to this SOP. The laboratory supervisor is responsible for
ensuring that all staff are trained and competent in this procedure and
for reviewing and authorizing the results.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred/Acceptable: Serum sample collected in a serum
separator tube (SST). Ensure that specimens are received in the
laboratory within 2 hours of collection.
• Unacceptable: Hemolyzed specimens, lipemic specimens,
specimens collected in anticoagulant tubes (e.g., EDTA, heparin).
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• ELISA plate reader with 450 nm filter
• Micropipettes and tips
• Vortex mixer
• Centrifuge
• Incubator set at 37°C
• Distilled or deionized water
• Plate washer (optional)
Reagents:
• COCONUT IGG ELISA kit (includes microtiter plate coated with
antigen, conjugate reagent, substrate reagent, stop solution, and
washing buffer)
• Calibration standards and controls (high, medium, low)
• Sample diluent
6. PROCEDURE
6.1. Sample Preparation
1. Allow serum samples to clot and centrifuge at 1500 x g for 10
minutes to separate the serum.
2. Label all tubes and microtiter plate wells clearly to avoid mix-up.
3. Dilute serum samples as specified by the ELISA kit instructions,
typically 1:100 with sample diluent.
6.2. Plate Setup
1. Prepare the microtiter plate as outlined in the ELISA kit,
ensuring that calibration standards, controls, and patient
samples are distributed appropriately across the plate.
2. Add 100 µL of the calibration standards, controls, and diluted
samples into the corresponding wells of the microtiter plate.
6.3. Incubation
1. Incubate the plate for 30 minutes at 37°C.
2. Wash the plate three times with the washing buffer.
3. Add 100 µL of conjugate reagent to each well.
4. Incubate the plate for 30 minutes at 37°C.
5. Wash the plate five times with the washing buffer.
6.4. Detection
1. Add 100 µL of substrate reagent to each well and incubate the
plate in the dark for 15 minutes at room temperature.
2. Add 50 µL of stop solution to each well to stop the reaction.
3. Read the optical density (OD) of each well at 450 nm using the
ELISA plate reader.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Calibration standards and controls should be included in each
run to validate the assay.
2. Results for controls must be within the specified ranges
provided by the manufacturer before patient results are
reported.
3. Document all QC results in the Quality Control Log.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Generate a standard curve using the OD readings from the
calibration standards.
2. Calculate the concentration of COCONUT IGG in patient
samples by interpolating the sample OD values from the
standard curve.
3. Review and verify all results.
4. Report results according to site-specific reporting guidelines.
9. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Normal range for COCONUT IGG: Provided by the manufacturer
or established through in-house validation.
10. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the ELISA kit insert for specific limitations and potential
interferences that might affect the assay accuracy.

needed.
