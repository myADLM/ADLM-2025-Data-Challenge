Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
CODFISH, IGE, SERUM Quantification
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this SOP is to outline the steps
required to accurately and efficiently quantify CODFISH,
Immunoglobulin E (IgE), and serum analytes in patient
samples. This procedure ensures standardized execution,
proper documentation, quality assurance, and the integrity of
analytical results.
2. SCOPE This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel
performing CODFISH, IgE, and serum analyses within our
CLIA-certified laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Laboratory Technologists are responsible for following this SOP
and adhering to quality control measures.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring all personnel are trained
and compliant with this SOP.
• Quality Assurance personnel are responsible for maintaining up-
to-date procedures and ensuring adherence to regulatory
standards.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• CODFISH Analysis: Serum
• IgE Analysis: Serum
• Serum Analysis: Serum
Note: All specimens should be collected following standard blood
collection protocols, preferably with SST (Serum Separator Tube).
Specimens should be centrifuged and separated within 2 hours of
collection.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• CODFISH Assay Kit
• IgE Quantification Kit
• General Serum Analyte Reagents
• Microcentrifuge
• Micropipettes and tips
• Standard Laboratory Instrument for each analysis (e.g., ELISA
reader, chemiluminescence analyzer)
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Follow manufacturer-specific quality control procedures for each
assay.
• Run control samples at each operational shift: at least one
negative control and one positive control.
• Document QC results in the QC Log. Flag and investigate any
values that fall outside the acceptable range.
1. PROCEDURE
A. CODFISH Analysis
1. Prepare reagents according to the CODFISH Assay Kit
instructions.
2. Label microcentrifuge tubes or microplates as needed.
3. Aliquot appropriate volumes of standards, controls, and patient
serum samples (50 µL each) into the assigned wells.
4. Add prepared detection reagents to each well as per assay
instructions.
5. Incubate at the specified temperature and duration per kit
instructions.
6. Wash wells and add developing solution.
7. Measure optical density (OD) at the specified wavelength using
an ELISA reader.
8. Calculate CODFISH concentrations using the calibration curve
generated by known standards.
9. Input results into the LIS and verify.
B. IgE Quantification
1. Prepare reagents according to the IgE Quantification Kit
instructions.
2. Label tubes or plates accordingly.
3. Pipette standards, controls, and patient serum samples (100 µL
each) into designated wells.
4. Add enzyme-labeled antibodies and incubate as per kit
instructions.
5. Perform wash steps and add substrate.
6. Read the absorbance values using an ELISA reader at the
recommended wavelength.
7. Calculate IgE concentrations against the generated standard
curve.
8. Document results in the LIS and perform result verification.
C. Serum Analysis (General Analytes)
1. Prepare reagents for each serum analyte as specified by the
test kit or system in use.
2. Dispense appropriate volumes of calibrators, controls, and
serum samples into analyzer-specific containers.
3. Load containers into the analytical instrument.
4. Perform automatic analysis according to the system’s operating
protocol.
5. Collect and review output data to ensure all analytes are within
reportable ranges.
6. Input verified results into the LIS.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
• All results must be double-checked for accuracy before reporting.
• Any critical or unexpected results should be promptly flagged and
reviewed by a senior technologist or supervisor.
• Results should be reviewed against patient history and previous
results when applicable for consistency.
• Verification by a second technologist should be documented.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• CODFISH: Refer to manufacturer or lab-specific reference
ranges.
• IgE: [0 - 100 IU/mL] (or per kit reference).
• Serum Analytes: Each analyte should have defined reference
intervals incorporated into the LIS.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Inaccuracies like cross-reactions, sample hemolysis, or improper
sample handling may affect results.
• Refer to each test kit’s package insert for specific limitations.
1. DOCUMENTATION
• Maintain detailed records of all analytical runs, including reagent
lot numbers, calibration curves, and QC results.
• Document any deviations and corrective actions taken in the
Deviation Log.
