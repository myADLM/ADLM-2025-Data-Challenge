Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for COENZYME Q10, REDUCED AND TOTAL,
PLASMA
1. PURPOSE
To establish a consistent and reliable procedure for the analysis and
generation of results for Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), Reduced and
Total, in plasma samples in a CLIA-certified laboratory.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the laboratory personnel to follow this SOP to
ensure the accuracy and reliability of the test results. The laboratory
supervisor is responsible for ensuring that this SOP is implemented
and that laboratory personnel are trained and competent in
conducting this analysis.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) system with
UV/Vis detector
• Refrigerated centrifuge
• Micropipettes and tips
• Vortex mixer
• Ice bath
• Fume hood
• Analytical balance
Reagents:
• Methanol (HPLC grade)
• Ethanol (HPLC grade)
• 1-propanol (HPLC grade)
• Mobile phase solutions as specified by HPLC manufacturer
• Standard solutions of Coenzyme Q10 (both reduced and total
forms)
• Internal standard (as specified for CoQ10 analysis)
• Plasma blank
• Antioxidant solution (as specified for stabilizing reduced CoQ10)
Supplies:
• Plasma sample collection tubes with EDTA
• 1.5 mL and 2 mL microcentrifuge tubes
• HPLC vials and caps
• Syringe filters (0.22 µm)
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/Acceptable:
• 4 mL blood collected in EDTA tubes. The plasma should be
separated immediately by centrifugation at 1500 x g for 10
minutes at 4°C. Plasma samples should be protected from light
and stored at -80°C until analysis.
Unacceptable:
• Hemolyzed specimens
• Specimens not protected from light
• Specimens not stored at appropriate temperature
• Specimens with no collection date/time indicated on the sample
container or requisition
5. PROCEDURE
a) Preparation of Standards and Quality Controls:
• Prepare a series of standard solutions of CoQ10 in appropriate
solvents according to manufacturer’s guidelines.
• Prepare quality control samples (low, medium, high
concentrations) in plasma matrix.
b) Sample Preparation:
1. Thaw plasma samples on ice and protect from light.
2. Transfer 200 µL of plasma to a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.
3. Add 20 µL of antioxidant solution to stabilize the reduced form
of CoQ10.
4. Vortex the mixture for 10-15 seconds.
5. Add 500 µL of 1-propanol (or other specified solvent).
6. Vortex vigorously for 1 minute.
7. Centrifuge the samples at 12,000 x g for 10 minutes at 4°C.
8. Transfer the supernatant to a clean microcentrifuge tube.
9. Filter the supernatant through a 0.22 µm syringe filter into an
HPLC vial.
c) HPLC Analysis:
1. Turn on the HPLC system and allow it to equilibrate with the
mobile phase.
2. Load standards, quality controls, and sample vials into the
HPLC autosampler.
3. Program the HPLC method according to manufacturer’s
instruction for CoQ10 detection.
4. Inject a sample volume of 20 µL into the HPLC system.
5. Monitor the chromatograms for the specific retention times of
CoQ10 (both reduced and total).
d) Data Analysis:
1. Identify and integrate the peaks corresponding to reduced and
total CoQ10.
2. Calculate the concentration of CoQ10 in the samples by
comparing with the standard curve.
3. Verify that quality control results are within the acceptable
range before proceeding with sample results.
4. Document any deviations or issues encountered during the
analysis.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Analyze quality control samples with each batch of patient
samples.
• Document and review control results to ensure they fall within the
established acceptable range.
• If quality control results fall outside the acceptable range,
troubleshoot, and resolve the issue before reporting patient
results.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results will be automatically transmitted to the Laboratory
Information System (LIS) for review.
• Review and verify the results to ensure accuracy.
• Document any critical or abnormal findings and notify the relevant
medical personnel as per laboratory policy.
8. REFERENCE INTERVALS AND LIMITATIONS
Reference intervals:
• Reduced CoQ10: Refer to specific kit insert or published
reference ranges.
• Total CoQ10: Refer to specific kit insert or published reference
ranges.
Method Limitations:
• Ensure proper sample handling to prevent oxidation of reduced
CoQ10.
• Hemolyzed samples may interfere with accurate determination.
• Refer to the HPLC kit insert for specific limitations related to the
analytical method.
