Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Analytical Phase for
Generating Results for Coenzyme Q10, Total, Plasma
1. PURPOSE
• To outline the procedure for the accurate and reliable analysis of
Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) levels in plasma samples, ensuring
quality results for clinical diagnosis and research purposes.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing
this procedure and documenting results according to this SOP.
• It is the responsibility of all laboratory staff to ensure adherence to
quality standards and report any issues to a supervisor
immediately.
1. DEFINITION
• Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), also known as ubiquinone, is a lipid-
soluble antioxidant playing a crucial role in mitochondrial electron
transport and cellular energy production.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND HANDLING
• Preferred/Acceptable Specimen:
◦ Whole blood collected in an EDTA or heparin tube, plasma
separated within 2 hours of collection.
◦ Specimen should be stored at -80°C if not analyzed
immediately.
• Unacceptable Specimen:
◦ Hemolyzed or lipemic samples.
◦ Samples not stored properly or exceeding stability limits.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) system
equipped with UV detection.
• Sample vials.
• Pipettes and pipette tips.
• Centrifuge.
• Standard Coenzyme Q10 reference material.
• Mobile phase solvents: Methanol, Ethanol, and others as per the
method.
• Internal standards and quality control materials.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation of Reagents and Standards
• Prepare mobile phase according to the HPLC method
specifications.
• Prepare CoQ10 standard solutions ranging from [X-X µg/mL] in
appropriate solvent.
• Prepare quality control samples at different concentration levels
(e.g., low, medium, high).
B. Sample Preparation
• Thaw plasma samples at room temperature.
• Vortex samples briefly for homogeneity.
• Pipette [XX] µL of plasma into a labeled sample vial.
• Add internal standard solution.
• Vortex mix and centrifuge the samples at 10,000 x g for 10
minutes to remove particulates.
• Carefully transfer supernatant to a new labeled HPLC vial.
C. Instrument Setup and Calibration
• Set up the HPLC system according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
• Equilibrate the column with the mobile phase until a stable
baseline is achieved.
• Inject calibration standards to generate a standard curve.
• Validate the calibration curve with independent quality control
samples.
D. Sample Analysis
• Inject [XX] µL of prepared plasma samples into the HPLC system.
• Follow the established chromatographic conditions:
◦ Column: [Column specifications]
◦ Flow rate: [XX] mL/min
◦ Detection wavelength: [XX] nm
◦ Run time: [XX] minutes
• Record retention times and peak areas for CoQ10 and internal
standards.
• Ensure appropriate system performance by reviewing control
sample results in each batch.
E. Calculation and Reporting of Results
• Calculate the concentration of CoQ10 in plasma samples using
the standard curve.
• Correct sample concentrations based on internal standard
recovery, if applicable.
• Report results in µg/mL (or appropriate unit) to two decimal
places.
• Ensure results are documented in Laboratory Information System
(LIS) for review and verification.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run two levels of quality control samples (low and high) with each
batch of patient samples.
• Acceptable limits for QC materials should be within ± 2 Standard
Deviations (SD) of the established mean.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results should be reviewed and verified by a technologist.
• Deviations or critical results must be promptly reported to the
ordering provider and documented accurately.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS (if applicable)
• Normal reference range for CoQ10 in plasma: [XX - XX µg/mL].
(May vary according to lab-specific validated data)
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Potential interference from hemolysis or lipid contamination.
• Stability of CoQ10 may vary with improper sample handling.
