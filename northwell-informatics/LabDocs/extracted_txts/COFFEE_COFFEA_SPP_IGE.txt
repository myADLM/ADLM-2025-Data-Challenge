STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES (SOP) FOR
ANALYTICAL PHASE: COFFEE (COFFEA SPP) IGE
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the process for the analysis of
IgE specific to Coffee (Coffea spp.) in patient samples. This protocol
ensures the generation of accurate and reliable results for clinical
diagnosis of coffee allergy.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel involved in the analytical
phase of Coffee (Coffea spp.) IgE testing.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all laboratory personnel to adhere to this
SOP and ensure the accuracy and reliability of test results. The
supervisor is responsible for ensuring ongoing compliance and
addressing any deviations from the procedure.
4. DEFINITION
Coffee (Coffea spp.) IgE: Immunoglobulin E specific to coffee
allergens, indicative of sensitization in individuals with suspected
coffee allergies.
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type: Serum or plasma (EDTA, heparin, or citrate treated).
Specimen Stability:
• Store serum or plasma samples at 2-8°C for up to 7 days.
• For longer storage, keep samples frozen at -20°C or below.
• Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or visibly contaminated samples.
6. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Immunoassay Analyzer (e.g., ImmunoCAP, ELISA reader)
• Coffee (Coffea spp.) allergen reagent kit
• Calibrators and controls specific to Coffee (Coffea spp.) IgE
• Pipettes and appropriate tips
• Refrigerator (2-8°C)
• Freezer (-20°C or below)
• Centrifuge
• Sample tubes
• Timer
7. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation
1. Verify the sample integrity and appropriateness upon receipt.
2. Label all samples clearly with patient identification.
3. If the sample is frozen, thaw completely at room temperature
and mix thoroughly before analysis.
4. Centrifuge samples at 1500-3000 g for 10-15 minutes to
separate serum or plasma from cellular components.
B. Calibration and Quality Control
1. Calibrate the immunoassay analyzer according to the
manufacturer’s instructions using the provided calibrators.
2. Run quality control materials alongside patient samples in each
analytical batch. Use at least two levels of QC material (e.g.,
low and high).
3. Accept or reject QC results based on predefined criteria before
proceeding with patient sample analysis.
C. Analytical Procedure
1. Load the samples, calibrators, and controls onto the
immunoassay analyzer.
2. Follow the specific steps outlined in the Coffee (Coffea spp.)
allergen reagent kit insert for sample preparation and loading.
3. Ensure all reagents required for the assay are loaded and
validated.
4. Initiate the assay run following the instrument’s software
instructions.
5. Monitor the run for any irregularities or alerts from the
instrument.
D. Result Generation and Validation
1. Upon completion of the run, retrieve results from the
immunoassay analyzer.
2. Review results for any flags or errors indicated by the
instrument.
3. Compare control results against accepted ranges to ensure
assay validity.
4. Validate patient results if QC results are within acceptable
ranges.
E. Troubleshooting and Corrective Action
1. If QC results fall outside acceptable limits:
◦ Recalibrate the instrument and rerun QC materials.
◦ Investigate potential causes (e.g., reagent contamination,
instrument malfunction).
◦ Document all troubleshooting steps and corrective actions
taken.
2. If patient results are flagged, repeat the assay or run samples
on an alternative method if necessary.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Enter validated results into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
2. Ensure proper documentation of assay conditions, calibrations,
and quality controls in the laboratory logbook.
3. Report results in accordance with laboratory-specific reporting
guidelines, indicating any comments or limitations if applicable.
