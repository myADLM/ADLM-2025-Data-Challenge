Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for
Cold Agglutinin Screen
1. Purpose
To ensure a standardized and accurate process for performing
the Cold Agglutinin Screen test, providing consistent and
reliable results.
2. Scope
This procedure applies to all clinical laboratory personnel
performing the Cold Agglutinin Screen within the laboratory.
3. Responsibility
◦ All designated staff are responsible for performing the
procedure as outlined in this SOP.
◦ It is the responsibility of the laboratory technologist to
ensure that all materials, reagents, and equipment are
prepared, maintained, and used correctly.
◦ The laboratory supervisor will ensure temperature
monitoring and overall compliance with this procedure.
4. Specimen Requirements
◦ Specimen Type: Whole blood, collected in a red-top (serum)
tube or EDTA tube.
◦ Volume: Minimum 5 mL whole blood.
◦ Handling: Specimens should be kept at room temperature
until testing begins. Do not refrigerate or freeze the
specimen prior to the test.
5. Materials, Reagents, and Equipment
◦ Water bath or incubator with precise temperature control.
◦ Centrifuge.
◦ Microscopic slides and cover slips.
◦ Glass test tubes.
◦ Saline (0.9% NaCl) solution.
◦ Light microscope.
◦ Positive and negative controls (commercially available or
prepared in-house).
6. Quality Control
◦ Quality control checks must be performed with each batch
of patient samples using known positive and negative
control sera.
◦ It is essential to log all results of control tests in the Quality
Control Log to ensure test accuracy.
7. Procedure
A. Blood Collection and Initial Handling:
1. Collect blood in a red-top (serum) tube or EDTA tube.
2. Gently mix the samples to avoid hemolysis.
3. Allow blood in red-top tubes to clot at room temperature
for at least 30 minutes.
B. Serum Separation: 4. Centrifuge the blood sample at
1500-2000 rpm for 10 minutes to separate the serum from the
cellular components. 5. Carefully transfer the serum into a
clean test tube.
C. Preparation for Cold Agglutinin Screening: 6. Label a
series of glass test tubes with the patient's identification code
and set up control tubes for positive and negative controls. 7.
Add 0.5 mL of saline solution into each test tube. 8. Add 0.5 mL
of the separated serum into each tube, including the control
tubes.
D. Incubation: 9. Incubate the tubes at 4°C (refrigerator or
water bath) for 1-2 hours.
E. Observation: 10. Following incubation, gently mix the
contents of each test tube. 11. Prepare thin smears on
microscopic slides from each tube, including controls. 12.
Examine the slides under the light microscope at 10x to 40x
magnification.
F. Interpretation of Results: 13. Observe and record any
agglutination in the test and control slides. - Positive Result:
The presence of visible agglutination in the patient’s serum
sample comparable to the positive control. - Negative Result:
Absence of agglutination, similar to the negative control.
8. Reporting Results:
◦ Results are entered into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
◦ A report is generated and reviewed by the technologist
before being sent to the requesting physician.
9. Critical Result Notification:
◦ Positive results indicating significant cold agglutinin
presence should be promptly communicated to the ordering
healthcare provider.
◦ Documentation of notifications should be included in the
patient’s record.
10. Documentation:
• All test procedures, observations, and results are to be
documented in the designated logbook.
• Maintain quality control logs for all control tests performed.
1. References:
• Manufacturer’s instructions for the scanner.
• Laboratory's internal quality control manual.
• Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines.
