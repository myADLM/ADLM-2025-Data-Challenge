Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Cold Agglutinin Titer, Serum
1. PURPOSE
To provide standardized operating procedures for the analytical
phase of performing and reporting Cold Agglutinin Titer tests to
ensure accuracy and consistency in results. This procedure outlines
the steps for performing Cold Agglutinin Titer testing, including
equipment calibration, specimen requirements, assay procedure,
quality control, and reporting results.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing and
documenting the Cold Agglutinin Titer test as per this SOP. It is the
responsibility of all staff to adhere to the protocol and report any
abnormalities or deviations to the supervisor.
1. DEFINITION
Cold Agglutinins are autoantibodies, typically IgM, that cause red
blood cells to agglutinate at low temperatures. The Cold Agglutinin
Titer test measures the concentration of these antibodies in the
serum of patients with potential cold agglutinin disease.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type:
• Serum (collected in SST or red-top tube)
Specimen Collection:
• Collect blood in a serum separator tube (SST) or a red-top tube.
• Allow the blood to clot at 37°C for 30 minutes.
• Centrifuge at 1300–1800 x g and 37°C for 10 minutes.
• Separate the serum from the clot and transfer to a clean, labeled
tube.
Specimen Stability:
• Store the serum at 37°C until the test is performed.
• If testing is delayed, store serum at 2-8°C for up to 48 hours or
freeze at -20°C for longer storage.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Samples exhibiting gross hemolysis or showing visible fibrin.
• Samples stored at temperatures above 37°C or below 2°C before
serum separation.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Water bath or incubator capable of maintaining 4°C and 37°C.
• Centrifuge with temperature control.
• Test tubes and racks.
• Pipettes and pipette tips.
Reagents:
• Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4.
Supplies:
• Cold agglutinin control serum (positive and negative controls).
• Glass slides.
• Coverslips.
• Microscope with temperature control for slide observation.
• 0.85% saline solution.
1. PROCEDURE
5.1 Preparation
• Equilibrate all reagents and samples to 37°C before use.
• Prepare 0.85% saline solution and PBS as necessary.
5.2 Assay Procedure
1. Serial Dilution:
◦ Make serial dilutions of the patient's serum in PBS from 1:2
to 1:2048.
2. Incubation at 4°C:
◦ Add one drop (50 µL) of each serum dilution to labeled test
tubes.
◦ Add an equal volume of 2% human erythrocyte suspension
prepared in 0.85% saline.
◦ Mix gently and incubate the tubes at 4°C for 1 hour.
3. Observation:
◦ Gently resuspend the cells and examine the agglutination
reaction under a microscope.
◦ Grade agglutination from 0 (no agglutination) to 4+ (full
agglutination).
4. Incubation at 37°C:
◦ Transfer tubes to a water bath at 37°C and incubate for an
additional 1 hour.
◦ Re-examine the tubes for agglutination at 37°C and grade
accordingly.
5. Result Interpretation:
◦ The highest serum dilution showing agglutination at 4°C but
resolving at 37°C constitutes the Cold Agglutinin Titer.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
6.1 Internal Quality Control
• Positive and negative control sera should be run with each batch
of patient tests.
• Controls must demonstrate expected results for the assay to be
valid.
6.2 Troubleshooting
• If controls do not perform as expected, check reagent integrity
and equipment calibration.
• Repeat the test if necessary.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Record the highest dilution showing agglutination at 4°C and
resolving at 37°C as the Cold Agglutinin Titer.
• Report results in the lab information system (LIS) in accordance
with site-specific guidelines.
• Communicate any critical or unexpected results to the supervising
clinician immediately.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Cold Agglutinin Titer: <1:32 (normal range; individual laboratory
reference range may vary).
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• The assay may be affected by improper sample handling, such as
temperature fluctuations.
• High lipemic or icteric samples may interfere with results.
