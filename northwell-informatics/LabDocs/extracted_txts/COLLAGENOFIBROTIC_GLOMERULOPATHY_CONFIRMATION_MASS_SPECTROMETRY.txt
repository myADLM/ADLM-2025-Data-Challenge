Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for COLLAGENOFIBROTIC
GLOMERULOPATHY CONFIRMATION using Mass Spectrometry
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this protocol is to standardize the procedure for the
analytical phase of generating results for collagenofibrotic
glomerulopathy (CFGP) confirmation using mass spectrometry. This
protocol ensures accuracy, repeatability, and reliability of test results.
Responsibility:
All laboratory personnel involved in the testing procedure must follow
this SOP. It is the responsibility of the laboratory managers and
supervisors to verify that this procedure is followed and that
appropriate training is provided.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Mass Spectrometer (e.g., MALDI-TOF, LC-MS/MS)
• Sample preparation instruments (e.g., centrifuge, pipettes)
• Calibration standards for mass spectrometry
• Quality control samples
• Solvents and reagents (e.g., acetonitrile, formic acid, water)
• Reagent preparation for protein extraction, digestion (trypsin), and
purification
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND PREPARATION
Specimen:
• Renal biopsy sample stored in appropriate buffer
• Additional tissue samples if necessary
Specimen Preparation:
1. Store the renal biopsy sample at -80°C until processing.
2. Thaw the renal biopsy sample on ice just before processing.
3. Homogenize the tissue in an appropriate lysis buffer using a
mechanical homogenizer.
4. Centrifuge the homogenate to remove debris and collect the
supernatant.
5. PROCEDURE
4.1 Protein Extraction
1. Transfer an appropriate volume of sample supernatant to a new
microcentrifuge tube.
2. Add a reducing agent such as dithiothreitol (DTT) and incubate
at 56°C for 30 minutes.
3. Add an alkylating agent such as iodoacetamide (IAA) and
incubate in the dark at room temperature for 30 minutes.
4.2 Enzymatic Digestion
1. Dilute the protein sample with an appropriate buffer (e.g.,
ammonium bicarbonate).
2. Add trypsin at a 1:50 (enzyme:substrate) ratio and incubate at
37°C overnight.
4.3 Peptide Purification
1. Desalt and purify peptides using a C18 column.
2. Elute peptides with a gradient of increasing organic solvent
(e.g., acetonitrile in water with 0.1% formic acid).
3. Dry the eluted peptides using a vacuum concentrator and
reconstitute in an appropriate solvent (e.g., 0.1% formic acid in
water).
4.4 Mass Spectrometry Analysis
1. Calibrate the mass spectrometer using calibration standards.
2. Inject the purified peptide sample into the mass spectrometer.
3. Configure the mass spectrometer settings for optimal peptide
identification (e.g., mass range, resolution, collision energy).
4. Acquire and record mass spectra data.
5. DATA ANALYSIS
6. Process raw spectral data using analytical software compatible
with the mass spectrometer.
7. Identify peptide sequences by comparing data against a protein
database (e.g., Mascot, Sequest).
8. Match identified peptides to known collagenofibrotic
glomerulopathy biomarkers.
9. Confirm the presence and quantify specific peptides relevant to
CFGP.
10. QUALITY CONTROL
11. Run quality control samples alongside patient samples to
ensure accuracy and precision.
12. Perform routine maintenance and calibration of mass
spectrometry equipment.
13. Document all quality control and maintenance activities.
14. REPORTING RESULTS
15. Validate results through independent review and confirmation.
16. Record final results and upload them to the Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
17. Prepare a report for the clinician, including interpretation and
relevant findings.
18. METHOD LIMITATIONS
19. Discuss known limitations such as sample integrity, cross-
contamination, or equipment-sensitivity.
20. Troubleshoot problems as needed and repeat the analysis if
required.
