Standard Operating Procedure: COLLAGEN IV
IMMUNOSTAIN, TECHNICAL COMPONENT ONLY
1. PURPOSE
To establish a standardized procedure for performing the technical
component of Collagen IV immunostaining on tissue sections to
ensure accurate and reproducible results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of designated laboratory staff to perform the
Collagen IV immunostaining according to this SOP. Supervisors are
responsible for ensuring staff compliance and addressing any
deviations or issues that arise during the procedure.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Acceptable Specimen:
• Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue sections.
• Slides should contain 3-5 µm thick sections.
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Tissue sections that are inadequately fixed or processed.
• Sections thicker than 5 µm or thinner than 3 µm.
• Damaged or improperly mounted sections.
4. REAGENTS AND MATERIALS
• Primary antibody: Anti-Collagen IV
• Secondary antibody: Biotinylated anti-mouse/rabbit (depending on
the primary)
• Detection system: HRP-conjugated streptavidin or polymer-based
system
• Chromogen: DAB (3,3'-Diaminobenzidine)
• Mounting medium
• Hematoxylin (for counterstaining)
• Tris-buffered saline (TBS)
• Xylene
• Ethanol (100%, 95%, 70%)
• Aqueous mounting medium or synthetic mounting medium
• Coverslips
• slides treated for immunohistochemistry
5. EQUIPMENT
• Microtome
• Water bath
• Slide rack
• Incubator (37°C)
• Humidity chamber
• Light microscope
• Deparaffinization and staining station
6. PROCEDURE
A) Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
1. Place slides with FFPE tissue sections in a 60°C oven for 30
minutes.
2. Deparaffinize slides by immersing in xylene for 3 minutes.
Repeat twice with fresh xylene.
3. Rehydrate slides through graded ethanol: 100% ethanol for 3
minutes, 95% ethanol for 3 minutes, and 70% ethanol for 3
minutes.
4. Rinse slides in distilled water for 1 minute.
B) Antigen Retrieval:
1. Place slides in a pre-warmed antigen retrieval solution (e.g.,
citrate buffer pH 6.0 or Tris-EDTA buffer pH 9.0).
2. Heat for 20 minutes using a microwave or pressure cooker
according to the buffer's recommended protocol.
3. Allow slides to cool to room temperature in the buffer for 20
minutes.
4. Rinse slides in TBS for 5 minutes.
C) Blocking:
1. Apply blocking solution (e.g., 5% normal serum in TBS) and
incubate for 10 minutes at room temperature to reduce non-
specific binding.
2. Tap off excess blocking solution; do not rinse.
D) Primary Antibody Incubation:
1. Apply primary antibody (Anti-Collagen IV) diluted in antibody
diluent according to the manufacturer's instructions.
2. Incubate in a humidity chamber for 60 minutes at room
temperature or overnight at 4°C.
3. Rinse slides in TBS for 5 minutes.
E) Secondary Antibody Incubation:
1. Apply biotinylated secondary antibody or polymer-based
detection reagent.
2. Incubate in a humidity chamber for 30 minutes at room
temperature.
3. Rinse slides in TBS for 5 minutes.
F) Detection:
1. Apply HRP-conjugated streptavidin or polymer-based detection
system.
2. Incubate for 30 minutes at room temperature.
3. Rinse slides in TBS for 5 minutes.
G) Chromogen Development:
1. Apply DAB solution to slides and monitor the color development
under a light microscope.
2. Once optimal staining is achieved (usually within 5 minutes),
stop the reaction by immersing slides in distilled water.
H) Counterstaining:
1. Counterstain slides with hematoxylin for 2 minutes.
2. Rinse slides in running tap water for 5 minutes to blue the
hematoxylin.
I) Dehydration and Mounting:
1. Dehydrate slides through graded ethanol: 70% ethanol for 1
minute, 95% ethanol for 1 minute, 100% ethanol for 1 minute.
2. Clear slides in xylene for 3 minutes.
3. Mount coverslips using a synthetic or aqueous mounting
medium.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Include a positive control slide known to express Collagen IV
and a negative control (primary antibody omitted) for each
batch.
2. Inspect stained slides under a light microscope to ensure
appropriate staining and assess any non-specific binding.
3. Record results and document any discrepancies or deviations
in the laboratory log.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Pathologists will review the immunostained slides and provide
an interpretive report.
2. Any issues encountered during the staining process should be
included in the final report for pathologist review.
