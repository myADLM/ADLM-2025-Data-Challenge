Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Analytical Phase for
Collagen Type II Antibody Testing
1. PURPOSE
To ensure accurate and consistent identification and quantification of
Collagen Type II Antibody in patient samples using Enzyme-Linked
Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) methodology.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of laboratory technologists to perform the
assay, document findings, and ensure compliance with the
procedures outlined in this protocol.
3. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all technologists performing the Collagen
Type II Antibody ELISA test.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred Specimen:
• Serum, collected in a red-top tube or serum-separator tube (SST).
• Minimum volume: 0.5 mL serum.
• Serum should be separated from cells within 2 hours of collection.
Stability:
• Room temperature: 24 hours.
• Refrigerated (2–8°C): Up to 72 hours.
• Frozen (-20/-70°C): Up to 3 months. Avoid repeated freeze-thaw
cycles.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• ELISA reader with appropriate wavelength settings (450 nm with a
reference filter of 620–650 nm).
• ELISA washer.
• Incubator set to 37°C.
• Micropipettes and tips.
• ELISA kit for Collagen Type II Antibody, including:
◦ Pre-coated ELISA plates.
◦ Standards.
◦ Detection antibodies.
◦ TMB substrate solution.
◦ Stop solution.
◦ Wash buffer.
◦ Assay buffer.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run positive and negative controls with each batch of tests.
• Follow the kit's instructions for dilution and preparation of controls.
• QC materials should be stored and handled as per manufacturer
specifications.
• Document all QC results and take corrective actions if controls fall
outside of the acceptable range.
7. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Preparation of Reagents: Thaw all reagents to room
temperature, gently mix, and avoid frothing.
2. Plate Layout: Arrange standards, controls, and patient
samples according to the plate map. Duplicate wells for each
standard, control, and sample are recommended.
Assay Procedure: 3. Standard and Sample Addition:
• Add 100 µL of standards, controls, and samples to respective
wells.
• Incubate for 1 hour at 37°C.
1. Washing:
◦ Wash the plate 3 times with 300 µL of wash buffer.
◦ Ensure complete removal of liquid after each wash.
2. Detection Antibody Addition:
◦ Add 100 µL of detection antibody to each well.
◦ Incubate for 30 minutes at 37°C.
3. Washing:
◦ Wash the plate 5 times with 300 µL of wash buffer.
4. Substrate Addition:
◦ Add 100 µL of TMB substrate solution to each well.
◦ Incubate in the dark for 10–15 minutes at room temperature.
5. Stopping Reaction:
◦ Add 100 µL of stop solution to each well.
6. Reading the Plate:
◦ Measure absorbance at 450 nm using the ELISA reader,
with a reference filter of 620–650 nm to correct readings.
8. INTERPRETATION AND REPORTING RESULTS
• Prepare a standard curve by plotting the absorbance of standards
against their concentrations.
• Use the standard curve to determine the concentration of
Collagen Type II Antibody in patient samples.
• Verify results against control values for accuracy.
• Record and report results in the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
• Abnormal or critical results must be rechecked and verified.
9. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Negative: < 20 U/mL.
• Weak Positive: 20–30 U/mL.
• Positive: > 30 U/mL.
10. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric specimens may interfere with test
results.
• Results from patients on immunosuppressive therapy should be
interpreted with caution.
11. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's instructions for the Collagen Type II Antibody
ELISA kit.
• Relevant peer-reviewed literature and standard laboratory
manuals.
12. DOCUMENTATION
• Maintain a log of all tests, quality control results, and any
incidents or deviations from the procedure.
• Ensure records are kept according to laboratory policy and
regulatory requirements.
13. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS
• Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) at all
times.
• Handle all biological specimens as potentially infectious.
• Follow waste disposal guidelines for hazardous materials.
14. REVIEW
• This SOP should be regularly reviewed and updated annually or
as needed when new information or regulations arise.
By following this protocol, laboratory technologists will ensure that
Collagen Type II Antibody results are consistently accurate and
reliable, supporting high-quality patient care.
