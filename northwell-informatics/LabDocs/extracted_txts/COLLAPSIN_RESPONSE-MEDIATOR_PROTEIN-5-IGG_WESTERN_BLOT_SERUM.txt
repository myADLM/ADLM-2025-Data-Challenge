SOP: COLLAPSIN RESPONSE-MEDIATOR PROTEIN-5-IGG,
WESTERN BLOT, SERUM
1. PURPOSE To clearly outline the procedure for conducting
Collapsin Response-Mediator Protein-5 IgG (CRMP-5 IgG)
testing using the Western Blot technique on serum samples.
This test is used to detect antibodies against CRMP-5 in patient
sera, which can provide valuable diagnostic information.
2. RESPONSIBILITY Designated laboratory personnel are
responsible for performing this procedure. It is the responsibility
of all staff to follow this SOP and to document all steps
thoroughly. Any problems or deviations from this procedure
should be reported to the supervising laboratory scientist
immediately.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY 3.1. Acceptable
Specimens:
◦ 5 mL serum collected in a plain red-top tube or serum
separator tube
◦ Transported at 2-8°C and received within 72 hours of
collection 3.2. Unacceptable Specimens:
◦ Hemolyzed, lipemic, or contaminated samples
◦ Specimens that are not labelled correctly with patient
identification and collection details
◦ Specimens received beyond the 72-hour stability window or
at inappropriate temperatures
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
◦ Western blot apparatus (electrophoresis unit and transfer
equipment)
◦ Gel electrophoresis reagents
◦ Nitrocellulose or PVDF membranes
◦ Blocking buffer (e.g., 5% non-fat milk in Tris-buffered saline
with Tween-20 [TBST])
◦ CRMP-5 antigen
◦ Primary antibodies: patient's serum diluted appropriately
◦ Secondary anti-human IgG antibodies conjugated to a
detectable marker (e.g., HRP)
◦ Detection substrate (e.g., chemiluminescent substrate for
HRP)
◦ Imaging system for antibody detection
◦ Positive and negative control sera
◦ Pipettes and tips
◦ Blotting paper
◦ Sterile containers for reagents and buffers
◦ Incubation trays
◦ Molecular weight markers
5. PROCEDURE 5.1. Gel Electrophoresis: 5.1.1. Prepare a
polyacrylamide gel suitable for the separation of CRMP-5
protein. 5.1.2. Load the gel with protein samples derived from
lysates containing the CRMP-5 antigen, including molecular
weight markers. 5.1.3. Perform electrophoresis until adequate
separation is achieved. 5.1.4. Soak the gel in transfer buffer.
5.2. Protein Transfer: 5.2.1. Set up protein transfer apparatus
according to manufacturer's instructions. 5.2.2. Transfer proteins from
the gel to the nitrocellulose or PVDF membrane. 5.2.3. Verify protein
transfer using Ponceau S staining (optional).
5.3. Blocking and Incubation: 5.3.1. Block the membrane in blocking
buffer for 1 hour at room temperature with gentle agitation. 5.3.2.
Incubate the membrane with the patient's diluted serum overnight at
4°C with gentle agitation. 5.3.3. Wash the membrane with TBST to
remove unbound antibodies.
5.4. Detection: 5.4.1. Incubate the membrane with secondary anti-
human IgG-HRP antibodies for 2 hours at room temperature. 5.4.2.
Wash the membrane thoroughly with TBST. 5.4.3. Apply detection
substrate and visualize using an imaging system. 5.4.4. Document
the band intensity and compare the patient's sample to positive and
negative controls.
1. QUALITY CONTROL 6.1. Include positive and negative control
sera in each run to ensure the validity of the test results. 6.2.
Document the results from all control sera. 6.3. Repeat the test
if control results are out of specified ranges or if there are
unexpected findings in the patient samples.
2. REPORTING RESULTS 7.1. Analyze the results based on band
detection and intensity. 7.2. Correlate the findings with clinical
data. 7.3. Report results to the clinician as either positive,
negative, or equivocal along with any relevant notes on band
intensity or other observed characteristics.
3. SAMPLE INTEGRITY 8.1. Inspect all specimens for integrity
(e.g., no hemolysis, lipemia, or contamination). 8.2. Verify
proper labelling and timely receipt of specimens. 8.3. Centrifuge
and inspect the sera before analysis for any signs of precipitate
or other abnormalities.
4. REFERENCES 9.1. Relevant scientific literature and instruction
manuals for the reagents and equipment used. 9.2.
Manufacturer's guidelines for blotting membranes and detection
substrates. 9.3. Clinical guidelines for the interpretation of
CRMP-5 IgG results.
5. REVISION RECORD 10.1. This SOP will be reviewed annually
and updated as needed to reflect changes in standards of
practice or advancements in methodology.
