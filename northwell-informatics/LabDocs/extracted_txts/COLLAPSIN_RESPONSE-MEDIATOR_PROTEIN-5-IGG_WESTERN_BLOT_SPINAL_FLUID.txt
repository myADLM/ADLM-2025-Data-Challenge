Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Analytical Phase: COLLAPSIN
RESPONSE-MEDIATOR PROTEIN-5-IGG, WESTERN BLOT,
SPINAL FLUID
1. PURPOSE
To outline the steps required for the detection and quantification of
Collapsin Response-Mediator Protein-5 (CRMP-5) IgG in spinal fluid
using Western Blot technique.
1. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel who are qualified and
trained to perform CRMP-5 IgG Western Blot analysis in a CLIA-
certified laboratory.
1. RESPONSIBILITIES
It is the responsibility of trained laboratory personnel to follow this
procedure precisely to ensure accurate and reliable results.
Responsibilities include preparing reagents, performing the assay,
troubleshooting issues, and documenting all relevant information.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Acceptable Specimen:
• Spinal fluid collected in a sterile container.
• Minimum volume: 0.5 mL
• Sample should be processed immediately or stored at -80°C until
the time of analysis.
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Samples with visible contamination, hemolysis, or insufficient
volume.
• Samples >24 hours old if kept at room temperature.
1. REAGENTS AND EQUIPMENT
• Standard Western Blot apparatus
• SDS-PAGE gels (7-10%)
• Nitrocellulose or PVDF membranes
• Blocking solution (e.g., 5% non-fat dry milk in TBS-T)
• Primary antibody: Anti-CRMP-5 IgG
• Secondary antibody: HRP-conjugated anti-human IgG
• Substrate for HRP (e.g., ECL)
• Molecular weight markers
• Calibration standards (if applicable)
• Lysis buffer, running buffer, and transfer buffer
• Densitometer for imaging
1. REAGENT PREPARATION
• Prepare SDS-PAGE gels according to manufacturer instructions.
• Prepare blocking solution and store at 4°C.
• Dilute primary and secondary antibodies to working
concentrations as per manufacturer guidelines.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation of Samples
1. Thaw spinal fluid specimens on ice.
2. Measure protein concentration using a standard Bradford
assay.
B. SDS-PAGE and Blotting
1. Load equal amounts of protein (20-30 µg per well) onto SDS-
PAGE gel along with appropriate molecular weight markers.
2. Run the gel at 100V until the dye front reaches the bottom.
3. Transfer proteins from the gel to a nitrocellulose or PVDF
membrane using wet or semi-dry transfer methods at 100V for
1 hour.
C. Blocking and Antibody Incubation
1. Block the membrane in blocking solution for 1 hour at room
temperature.
2. Incubate the membrane with anti-CRMP-5 IgG primary antibody
diluted in blocking solution overnight at 4°C.
3. Wash the membrane three times with TBS-T for 10 minutes
each.
4. Incubate with HRP-conjugated secondary antibody diluted in
blocking solution for 1 hour at room temperature.
5. Wash the membrane three times with TBS-T for 10 minutes
each.
D. Detection and Analysis
1. Apply ECL substrate to the membrane according to
manufacturer instructions.
2. Detect the signal using a densitometer or suitable imaging
system.
3. Save images and analyze band intensities relative to molecular
weight markers and standard controls.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include positive and negative controls in each run.
• Ensure all equipment is calibrated and maintained according to
manufacturer specifications.
• Document all assay details, including lot numbers of reagents and
any deviations from the SOP.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If no bands are observed: Check the transfer efficiency, confirm
antibody activity, and review protein loading concentration.
• If non-specific bands are observed: Optimize antibody
concentrations and blocking conditions.
• If weak signals are observed: Increase the loading amount of the
sample or the exposure time of ECL.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• The presence of CRMP-5 IgG is indicated by a specific band at
the expected molecular weight.
• Results must be reviewed and verified by a qualified technologist.
• Report results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS) along
with any relevant comments or observations.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer instructions for SDS-PAGE, Western Blot
apparatus, and antibodies.
• Standard laboratory protocols for protein electrophoresis and
immunoblotting.
1. DOCUMENTATION
• Document all steps, observations, and deviations in the laboratory
logbook or electronic record.
• Maintain records of reagent lot numbers, calibration dates, and
equipment maintenance.
