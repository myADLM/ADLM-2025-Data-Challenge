Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for COLLAPSIN RESPONSE-
MEDIATOR PROTEIN-5 (CRMP-5) NEURONAL IGG TITER,
SERUM
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the procedures for analyzing and generating
results for CRMP-5 Neuronal IgG Titer in serum. The processes
ensure that test results are accurate, reliable, and timely.
1. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all designated laboratory staff performing
the analytical phase of CRMP-5 Neuronal IgG Titer testing.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
• Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing
the test according to the procedure and documenting all findings.
• Laboratory supervisors are responsible for reviewing and verifying
test results and ensuring quality control measures are adhered to.
1. DEFINITION
CRMP-5 Neuronal IgG Titer is a specific antibody titer test used for
the diagnosis of paraneoplastic neurological syndromes.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• ELISA plate reader
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Microcentrifuge
• Incubator
• Plate washer
• Vortex mixer
Reagents:
• CRMP-5 antigen-coated ELISA plates
• Anti-human IgG conjugated with enzyme (peroxidase or alkaline
phosphatase)
• Substrate solution (e.g., TMB for peroxidase)
• Stop solution (e.g., sulfuric acid for peroxidase)
• Wash buffer
• Diluent buffer
Supplies:
• Calibrated controls (positive and negative)
• Calibrators/standards
• Microcentrifuge tubes
• Disposable gloves
• Laboratory coat
1. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Preparation
a. Receive and verify specimens. b. Ensure that specimens are
labeled correctly and meet the acceptance criteria. c. Centrifuge the
serum sample at 1500 x g for 10 minutes to separate serum from
cells. d. Aliquot the serum into labeled microcentrifuge tubes.
B. Test Setup
a. Bring all reagents and samples to room temperature before
starting the assay. b. Set up the ELISA plate according to the
provided ELISA kit protocol.
C. Assay Procedure
1. Pipette the appropriate volume of standards, controls, and
patient samples into assigned wells.
2. Add the diluted patient sera to the wells.
3. Incubate the plate at 37°C for 1 hour.
4. Wash the plate three times with wash buffer using a plate
washer.
5. Add the enzyme conjugate anti-human IgG to each well.
6. Incubate the plate at room temperature for 30 minutes.
7. Wash the plate five times with wash buffer.
8. Add the substrate solution to each well.
9. Incubate the plate in the dark at room temperature for 10-20
minutes.
10. Add stop solution to each well to halt the enzymatic reaction.
11. Read the plate at the appropriate wavelength using the ELISA
plate reader (typically 450 nm with a reference wavelength of
620 nm).
D. Calibration and Quality Control
a. Include calibration controls provided in the kit with each batch of
tests. b. Analyze quality controls with each run to ensure accuracy
and reliability. c. Compare the results of controls to the expected
ranges. If controls fall outside of acceptable ranges, investigate and
troubleshoot.
E. Interpretation of Results
a. Calculate the patient IgG titer using the standard curve provided by
the calibrators. b. Compare the patient titer to reference ranges for
interpretation. c. Report results as per laboratory reporting guidelines.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
a. Perform QC for each new lot and shipment of reagents. b.
Document any deviations and troubleshooting steps taken in the QC
log. c. Ensure routine external quality assessments are conducted to
maintain standards.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
a. Enter results into the laboratory information system (LIS). b.
Review and verify the accuracy of results before releasing.
1. CRITICAL VALUES & ACTIONS
a. Report critical values to the ordering physician immediately
following the lab’s protocol for critical results notification. b. Document
the critical results and the communication in the patient’s record.
1. REFERENCES
Refer to the ELISA kit insert and manufacturer’s guidelines for
specific detailed instructions and limitations.
1. DOCUMENTATION
a. Ensure all steps, observations, and results are documented
accurately in appropriate logs and electronic systems. b. Retain
records according to the laboratory’s retention policy.
