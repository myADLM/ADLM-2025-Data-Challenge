Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Generating Results for
COLLAPSIN RESPONSE-MEDIATOR PROTEIN-5 (CRMP-5)
NEURONAL IGG TITER, SPINAL FLUID
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the procedures for the analytical phase of
generating results for COLLAPSIN RESPONSE-MEDIATOR
PROTEIN-5 (CRMP-5) Neuronal IgG Titer in spinal fluid. It ensures
consistency, accuracy, and reliability of test results according to the
Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) standards.
Responsibility:
All laboratory technologists and supervisory staff are responsible for
adhering to this SOP and ensuring the proper execution and
documentation of all procedural steps as required.
1. DEFINITIONS
CRMP-5 Neuronal IgG: An antibody titer measured in spinal fluid to
aid in the diagnosis of certain neurological conditions.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Acceptable Specimens:
• Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) collected in a sterile container.
• The volume of CSF required: Approximately 1 mL.
• Transport CSF specimens to the laboratory as soon as possible,
refrigerate if delayed.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens with visible contamination or precipitate.
• Hemolysed, clotted, or improperly labeled specimens.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• ELISA Reader (Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay)
• Micropipettes and disposable tips
• CRMP-5 IgG ELISA kit, including reagents and controls
• Plate washer
• Timer
• Incubator (37°C)
• Sterile, polypropylene tubes for sample handling and dilution
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
1. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation:
1. Wear appropriate PPE.
2. Mix the CSF sample thoroughly by gentle inversion.
3. Prepare sample dilutions as per manufacturer’s instructions
using sterile polypropylene tubes.
4. Label the tubes accordingly with sample identification.
B. Assay Procedure:
1. Place the required number of ELISA plate wells provided in the
CRMP-5 IgG ELISA kit.
2. Add 100 µL of diluted CSF samples, standards, and controls to
designated wells.
3. Incubate the plate at 37°C as specified by the kit manufacturer
(typically 1-2 hours).
4. After incubation, wash the wells thoroughly using the plate
washer with a recommended wash buffer.
5. Add 100 µL of the enzyme-conjugate reagent to each well.
6. Incubate the plate at 37°C for the time specified by the kit
manufacturer (typically 30-60 minutes).
7. Perform another wash cycle as described in the previous step.
8. Add 100 µL of substrate solution to each well.
9. Incubate the plate at room temperature in the dark for the
developer time specified (typically 10-20 minutes).
10. Stop the reaction by adding the stop solution provided in the kit,
using 100 µL per well.
11. Read the optical density (OD) at the appropriate wavelength
specified by the ELISA kit (typically 450 nm) using the ELISA
reader.
C. Calculation and Results Interpretation:
1. Calculate the results using the standard curve plotted with the
known standards.
2. Determine the concentration of CRMP-5 Neuronal IgG in CSF
samples by referencing the standard curve.
3. Verify the results against internal quality controls and
established reference ranges.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run positive and negative controls with each assay to ensure
assay reliability and accuracy.
• Perform calibration of the ELISA reader as per manufacturer’s
instructions regularly.
• Document all quality control measures, including control results
and any corrective actions taken, in the quality control log.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
2. Review the calculated results for each CSF sample.
3. Verify any critical values as per the laboratory's policy.
4. Document and report the results in the Laboratory Information
System (LIS) for review by the supervising technologist.
5. Ensure all results and quality control data are appropriately
documented.
6. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to the ELISA kit insert for specific limitations related to the
reagents and procedural variability.
• Hemolysed or clotted samples may interfere with accurate
detection and result generation.
