STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP) FOR ANALYTICAL
PHASE OF COMBINED MITOCHONDRIAL FULL GENOME AND
NUCLEAR GENE PANEL, VARIES
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the procedures for the analytical phase of
generating results for combined mitochondrial full genome and
nuclear gene panel testing. This document ensures standardized and
high-quality procedures are followed to produce accurate and
reproducible results, ultimately aiding in the diagnosis of
mitochondrial and related genetic disorders.
2. RESPONSIBILITIES
The selected staff trained in molecular testing techniques are
responsible for performing the procedures detailed in this SOP. It is
the responsibility of the laboratory supervisor to ensure that all
personnel are adequately trained and competent in these
procedures, as well as to manage any corrective actions required.
3. DEFINITIONS
• Mitochondrial Genome: The complete set of mitochondrial DNA,
which includes 37 genes essential for mitochondrial function.
• Nuclear Gene Panel: A set of nuclear genes associated with
mitochondrial and other relevant disorders to be analyzed in
combination with the mitochondrial genome.
• Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS): A high-throughput method
used to determine the sequence of nucleotides in DNA.
4. EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS
• NGS Machine (such as Illumina MiSeq)
• PCR Thermocyclers
• DNA Extraction Kits
• Library Preparation Kits (specific to NGS platform)
• Cleanroom consumables (gloves, pipettes, tips, tubes, etc.)
• Bioinformatics Software for sequence analysis
• Calibrated pipettes and thermal cyclers
• Positive and negative controls
5. PROCEDURE
A) DNA Extraction:
1. Sample Preparation:
◦ Ensure specimens are properly received, accessioned, and
stored at appropriate conditions prior to processing.
2. DNA Isolation:
◦ Perform DNA extraction from specimen using a validated
DNA extraction kit and according to the manufacturer’s
protocol.
◦ Quantify DNA using Qubit or Nanodrop and evaluate purity
by the A260/A280 ratio.
3. Quality Control:
◦ Assess DNA integrity via gel electrophoresis.
◦ Store extracted DNA at -20°C pending further procedures.
B) Library Preparation:
1. Preparation:
◦ Equilibrate required reagents to room temperature.
◦ Thaw DNA samples on ice and prepare working dilutions.
2. Amplicon Generation:
◦ Use primer sets to amplify regions of interest in both the
mitochondrial genome and nuclear genes.
◦ Perform PCR using thermocycler with specified conditions
for each primer set.
◦ Validate amplicon size and specificity through gel
electrophoresis.
3. Library Construction:
◦ Pool target amplicons as per optimization.
◦ Carry out end-repair, A-tailing, and adapter ligation suitable
for the NGS platform in use.
◦ Clean up libraries using magnetic beads and follow with
quantification using qPCR or Bioanalyzer.
C) Next-Generation Sequencing:
1. Sequencer Preparation:
◦ Perform system setup and maintenance checks.
◦ Load libraries into NGS machine and configure sequencing
parameters as specified in user manuals.
2. Sequencing:
◦ Monitor sequence run progress.
◦ Use real-time data visualization to assess run quality and
yield.
D) Data Analysis:
1. Primary Analysis:
◦ Export raw sequence files (FASTQ) upon run completion.
◦ Use quality control software (e.g., FastQC) to evaluate read
quality.
2. Bioinformatics Analysis:
◦ Align sequences to reference mitochondrial and nuclear
genomes using appropriate bioinformatics pipelines.
◦ Identify variants through variant calling software and
annotate using databases like ClinVar and gnomAD.
3. Interpretation and Reporting:
◦ Assess pathogenicity of variants using ACMG guidelines.
◦ Compile and review genetic findings alongside clinical
information.
◦ Generate detailed report including detected variants, clinical
correlation, and recommendations for follow-up testing if
necessary.
6. QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE
• Run positive and negative controls with each batch of reactions to
monitor performance.
• Thoroughly document all steps and deviations from SOP.
• Engage in regular proficiency testing and participate in external
quality assessment schemes.
7. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If DNA quality is poor, re-extract samples or request re-
submission.
• Address sequencing run failure by repeating library prep and
sequencing.
• Revalidate any dubious results through Sanger sequencing or
repeat NGS run.
