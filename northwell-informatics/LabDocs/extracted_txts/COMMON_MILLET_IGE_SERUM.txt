Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Common Millet, IgE, Serum
1. PURPOSE
To establish a standardized procedure for the analysis of Common
Millet-specific IgE in serum samples in the clinical laboratory,
ensuring reliable and accurate results.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing
the test, documenting the process, and reporting results as
defined in this procedure.
• It is the responsibility of the laboratory supervisors to ensure the
procedure is followed, monitored, and to address any difficulties
or discrepancies that may arise during testing.
1. DEFINITION
Common Millet-specific IgE testing is used to identify allergic
sensitization to Common Millet. This immunological test involves
measuring the serum IgE levels specific to Common Millet protein
using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or similar
immunoassay.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen:
• Preferred: Serum, collected in a plain red-top tube or serum
separator tube (SST).
• Minimum volume: 0.5 mL.
• Stability: Stable at 2-8°C for up to 7 days post-collection. For
longer storage, specimens should be frozen at -20°C or colder.
Unacceptable specimens:
• Hemolyzed, icteric, or lipemic samples.
• Specimens collected in tubes other than plain red-top or SST.
• Specimens with insufficient volume.
• Specimens stored at room temperature for over 2 hours.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• ELISA plate reader and washer.
• Common Millet allergen-specific IgE assay kit.
• Incubator set at 37°C.
• Micropipettes and tips, disposable.
• Microcentrifuge.
• Distilled or deionized water.
• Laboratory timer.
• 1X Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or wash buffer (as stated in
the kit insert).
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Designated control sera (negative and positive for Common
Millet-specific IgE) should be included in each assay run.
• Follow manufacturer-provided control ranges for acceptable limits.
• Document all control results in the Quality Control Log.
1. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Bring all reagents and specimens to room temperature
(20-25°C) before use.
2. Prepare all reagents and working solutions as instructed by the
manufacturer's kit insert.
Assay Procedure:
1. Coat ELISA Plate (if applicable):
◦ Apply allergen-coated wells as per the manufacturer's
instructions.
2. Add Serum Samples:
◦ Add 100 µL of each patient serum sample, control, and
standard (if provided) to designated wells.
◦ Include blank wells with diluent only for background
reference.
3. Incubation:
◦ Incubate the plate at 37°C for 1 hour, or according to kit
instructions, to allow antigen-antibody binding.
4. Washing:
◦ Wash the wells 3-5 times with PBS or wash buffer to remove
unbound antibodies.
5. Detection:
◦ Add detection antibody (usually enzyme-linked anti-IgE) to
each well and incubate at room temperature for the
specified time (typically 30-60 minutes).
6. Washing:
◦ Wash the wells 3-5 times thoroughly to remove unbound
detection antibody.
7. Substrate Addition:
◦ Add substrate solution and incubate in the dark at room
temperature for the recommended time, generally 15-30
minutes.
8. Stop Reaction:
◦ Add stop solution to each well to halt the substrate reaction.
9. Read Plate:
◦ Measure the optical density (OD) at the appropriate
wavelength (usually 450 nm with a 620-650 nm reference
filter) using an ELISA plate reader.
10. CALCULATION AND INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
11. Calculate the average OD values for each set of duplicate
controls and samples.
12. Subtract the mean OD of the blank wells from the OD values of
patient samples and controls.
13. Construct a standard curve using the OD values of known
standards against their corresponding concentrations (if
provided).
14. Determine the concentration of Common Millet-specific IgE in
patient samples using the standard curve or interpret the results
as per the manufacturer's guidelines.
Interpretation of Results:
• Levels of IgE specific to Common Millet above the provided cutoff
value indicate sensitization.
• Report results in kU/L (kilo-Units per Liter) or as qualitative
positive/negative (sensitized/not sensitized), following the report
format guidelines.
1. QUALITY CONTROL AND REPORTING RESULTS
• Ensure that control values are within the accepted range. If
controls are out of range, troubleshoot as per QA guidelines
before reporting patient results.
• Document all results and actions taken in the laboratory
information system (LIS).
• Report results to the requesting physician or clinical team via the
established laboratory reporting system.

accuracy, and reliability in the analysis and reporting of Common
Millet-specific IgE results.
