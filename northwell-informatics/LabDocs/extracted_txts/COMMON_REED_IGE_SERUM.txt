Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analysis of Common
Reed, IgE, Serum
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to provide standardized guidelines
for the analysis and generation of results for Common Reed-specific
Immunoglobulin E (IgE) in a serum sample. This SOP ensures
accuracy, precision, reproducibility, and reliability of test results.
1. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel conducting Common
Reed IgE analysis using serum samples.
1. RESPONSIBILITIES
◦ Laboratory Technologists: To perform the analysis as per
the SOP and document results.
◦ Supervisors: To ensure adherence to this SOP and
address any issues that arise during the analysis.
◦ Quality Control Personnel: To monitor and validate the
quality control aspects of this procedure.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
◦ Specimen Type: Serum.
◦ Preferred Volume: 1 mL of serum.
◦ Stability:
▪ Room Temperature: Stable for up to 8 hours.
▪ Refrigerated (2-8°C): Stable for up to 7 days.
▪ Frozen (< -20°C): Stable for up to 1 month. Avoid
repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
◦ Equipment:
▪ Centrifuge
▪ Refrigerated storage
▪ Pipettes and tips
▪ ELISA Plate Reader or Automated Analyzer compatible
with IgE tests
◦ Reagents:
▪ Common Reed IgE specific ELISA Kit or equivalent.
▪ Quality control materials (negative and positive controls)
▪ Calibrators
▪ Wash buffer
▪ Substrate solution
▪ Stop solution
◦ Supplies:
▪ Micropipette tips
▪ Sample vials
▪ ELISA plates
4. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation:
1. Bring all reagents and samples to room temperature
before starting the assay.
2. Label the ELISA plate according to the number of
samples and controls to be tested.
B. Sample and Reagent Handling:
1. Thaw frozen samples at room temperature and mix gently
by inversion.
2. Prepare the dilutions of calibrators, controls, and patient
samples as per the kit instructions.
C. Assay Protocol:
1. Add the appropriate volume (typically 100 µL) of
calibrators, controls, and diluted patient samples into
assigned wells.
2. Incubate the plate as instructed in the ELISA kit protocol
(typically 30-60 minutes at room temperature or 37°C).
3. Wash the plate according to the instructions provided with
the ELISA kit to remove unbound materials.
4. Add the enzyme-conjugate solution to each well and
incubate for the specified time.
5. Wash the plate again to remove unbound conjugate.
6. Add the substrate solution and incubate. The duration and
condition should be as prescribed (e.g., 10-30 minutes).
7. Add the stop solution to each well to halt the enzymatic
activity.
8. Read the optical density of each well using an ELISA
plate reader at the wavelength specified by the kit (e.g.,
450 nm).
D. Calculation and Interpretation of Results:
1. Create a standard curve from the optical density readings
of the calibrators.
2. Determine the IgE concentration in patient samples by
comparing their optical density readings to the standard
curve.
3. Report results in international units per milliliter (IU/mL).
5. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Run both positive and negative controls with each batch of
tests.
◦ Verify that control results fall within the expected ranges. If
they do not, troubleshoot and repeat the assay.
◦ Document all quality control results and any corrective
actions taken.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ Results greater than a threshold value must be reviewed
and verified by a senior technologist or supervisor before
reporting.
◦ Enter the results into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS) along with comments if applicable (e.g., diluted
samples, hemolysis noted).
7. REFERENCE INTERVALS
◦ Refer to the specific kit instructions or laboratory reference
guidelines.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples may interfere with assay
results.
• Cross-reactivity with other allergens should be considered.
• Results should be interpreted in conjunction with other clinical
findings.
1. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS
• Follow all applicable safety protocols and use Personal Protective
Equipment (PPE) while handling specimens and reagents.
• Dispose of all biohazardous materials in accordance with local
regulations.
