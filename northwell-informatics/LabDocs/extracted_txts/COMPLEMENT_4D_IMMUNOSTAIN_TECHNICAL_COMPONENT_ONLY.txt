Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Complement 4d
Immunostain, Technical Component Only
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the procedure for performing the Complement 4d
(C4d) immunostaining test for the technical component only. The
purpose is to ensure consistent and accurate technical processing of
tissue specimens for Complement 4d detection via
immunohistochemistry (IHC).
2. REAGENTS AND EQUIPMENT
Reagents:
• Primary antibody: Anti-C4d antibody
• Secondary antibody: Anti-Rabbit or Anti-Mouse IgG depending on
the primary antibody
• Detection reagent: DAB (Diaminobenzidine) or other chromogens
• Hematoxylin for counterstaining
• Blocking solution (Normal serum or BSA)
• Antigen retrieval solution (Citrate buffer, pH 6.0 or EDTA buffer,
pH 8.0)
• Tris-buffered saline (TBS) or Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)
Equipment:
• Microtome
• Water bath (for tissue section heating)
• Slide rack
• Immunostaining platform
• Incubator or humidified chamber
• Light microscope
• Documentation logbook/computerized logging system
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks
• Tissue sections prepared on positively charged microscope slides
4. PROCEDURE
4.1 Tissue Sectioning
1. Cut 3-4 µm thick sections from FFPE tissue blocks with a
microtome.
2. Float sections in a water bath and pick them up on positively
charged microscope slides.
3. Air dry the slides overnight or incubate at 37°C for 1-2 hours.
4.2 Deparaffinization and Rehydration
1. Place slides in a slide rack and deparaffinize in xylene (3
changes, 5 minutes each).
2. Rehydrate slides through a graded series of ethanol (100%,
95%, 70%, 5 minutes each).
3. Rinse slides in running tap water for 5 minutes to remove
ethanol.
4.3 Antigen Retrieval
1. Prepare antigen retrieval solution (Citrate buffer, pH 6.0 or
EDTA buffer, pH 8.0).
2. Heat the retrieval solution to 95-100°C in a microwave or water
bath.
3. Immerse the slides in the retrieval solution and maintain the
temperature for 20-30 minutes.
4. Allow the slides to cool at room temperature for 20 minutes.
5. Rinse slides in distilled water followed by TBS/PBS.
4.4 Blocking
1. Incubate slides with blocking solution for 20 minutes at room
temperature to reduce non-specific binding.
2. Drain excess blocking solution without washing.
4.5 Primary Antibody Incubation
1. Apply the primary anti-C4d antibody to each tissue section.
Allow the specific conditions (antibody dilution) furnished by the
antibody manufacturer.
2. Incubate the slides in a humidified chamber at room
temperature for 1 hour or at 4°C overnight.
3. Wash slides thoroughly with TBS/PBS (3x5 minutes).
4.6 Secondary Antibody and Detection
1. Apply the secondary antibody (linked to a detection system) to
each section.
2. Incubate slides in a humidified chamber at room temperature as
specified by the manufacturer (e.g., 30 minutes).
3. Wash slides with TBS/PBS (3x5 minutes).
4. Apply the detection reagent (DAB or equivalent chromogen
solution) until the desired color intensity develops (usually 5-10
minutes).
5. Rinse slides in distilled water to stop the reaction.
4.7 Counterstaining and Mounting
1. Counterstain with hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes.
2. Rinse slides in tap water and bluing reagent if necessary.
3. Dehydrate the slides through graded series of ethanol (70%,
95%, 100%, 5 minutes each).
4. Clear in xylene (2x5 minutes).
5. Mount with a suitable mounting medium and cover with a
coverslip.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include known positive and negative tissue controls in each run.
• Document the staining results and observations in the logbook/
computer system.
• Any unexpected or questionable staining results should be re-
evaluated, and a repeated test may be necessary.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
• Technical results including slides are sent to the interpreting
pathologist for review.
• Record the case identification and technical details in the
laboratory information system (LIS).
7. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS
• Follow standard biosafety guidelines while handling FFPE tissues
and reagents.
• Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) including
gloves, lab coats, and eyewear.
• Dispose of waste according to institutional hazardous waste
protocols.
