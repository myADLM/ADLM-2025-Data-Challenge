Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Complement C1q Test, Serum
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized method for the measurement of
Complement C1q in serum. This protocol ensures precision,
accuracy, and reliability in the generation of results for clinical and
research purposes.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
This procedure is to be performed by qualified and trained laboratory
technologists with expertise in immunoassay techniques. It is the
responsibility of the laboratory supervisor to ensure that all personnel
are trained on this SOP and that adherence to this procedure is
strictly followed.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred specimen:
• 2-3 mL serum, separated from whole blood as soon as possible
• Samples should be collected in a clot activator tube (commonly a
red-top tube or serum separator tube).
Unacceptable specimens:
• Hemolyzed samples.
• Lipemic samples.
• Specimens that have been improperly collected or stored.
Samples should be transported to the laboratory immediately after
collection. If immediate transport is not possible, refrigerate the
specimen at 2–8°C and analyze within 7 days. For long-term storage,
freeze specimens at -20°C or lower.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Automated immunoassay analyzer (specific to the platform used
in the laboratory, e.g., ELISA reader).
• Centrifuge.
• Refrigerator and freezer.
• Pipettes.
Reagents:
• Complement C1q assay kit (commercially available from
approved vendors).
• Calibrators and controls for Complement C1q.
• Deionized water.
• Diluent provided in the assay kit.
Supplies:
• Microplates (if using ELISA).
• Reaction wells (if using automated platforms).
• Disposable gloves, lab coat, and other personal protective
equipment (PPE).
• Laboratory-grade disposable pipette tips.
5. PROCEDURE
5.1 Preparation:
1. Upon receipt, inspect the samples for acceptability (e.g., no
hemolysis, adequate volume).
2. Allow samples, controls, and reagents to reach room
temperature (20–25°C) before beginning the assay.
5.2 Calibration and Quality Control:
1. Prepare all calibrators, controls, and specimens according to
the manufacturer’s instructions included with the Complement
C1q assay kit.
2. Perform calibration of the instrument with the calibrators
provided, following the instrument-specific protocol.
3. Run external quality controls at the beginning of each batch,
with each run, and after any maintenance or recalibration.
5.3 Assay Procedure:
1. Label the microplate wells for samples, controls, and standards
appropriately.
2. Pipette the required volume of standards, controls, and serum
samples into the designated wells.
3. Add the necessary reagents, including enzyme conjugate and
substrate, as per the manufacturer's instructions.
4. Incubate the microplate for the designated period at the
recommended temperature.
5. After incubation, wash the wells to remove unbound reagents, if
applicable.
6. Add the stop solution to halt the enzymatic reaction.
7. Measure the absorbance of each well using a
spectrophotometer/microplate reader at the appropriate
wavelength indicated by the manufacturer (e.g., 450 nm).
5.4 Calculation of Results:
1. Generate a standard curve by plotting the absorbance values of
the standards against their known concentrations.
2. Determine the concentration of Complement C1q in the serum
samples by interpolating their absorbance values from the
standard curve.
3. Ensure that all controls fall within the specified ranges. Reassay
if controls are out of range.
6. REPORTING RESULTS:
1. Document the results in the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
2. Verify the results before releasing them.
3. Flag any results that fall outside of the reference range for
further clinical review.
7. QUALITY CONTROL AND TROUBLESHOOTING:
1. Utilize internal and external quality control materials as per
laboratory protocol.
2. Conduct instrument maintenance and calibration checks as
recommended.
3. If any errors or inconsistencies are found, troubleshoot by
reviewing sample integrity, reagent performance, procedural
steps, and instrument function.
4. Document any deviations, corrective actions taken, and review
by the supervisor.
