Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Analytical Phase: Generating Results for Complement C3 and C4
with Anti-C1Q Antibodies, Serum
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to ensure the accurate and timely
analysis and reporting of Complement C3 and C4 levels, along with
Anti-C1Q Antibodies in serum specimens. This will ensure consistent,
reliable results crucial for the diagnosis and management of
conditions involving the complement system.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of all designated laboratory personnel to follow
this protocol accurately to ensure the quality of test results.
Supervisors must ensure that all staff performing these tests are
adequately trained and any deficiencies are addressed promptly.
1. DEFINITION AND BACKGROUND
Complement C3 and C4 are key proteins in the complement system,
part of the immune system's innate defense mechanisms. Anti-C1Q
antibodies target the C1Q component of the complement system and
are particularly relevant in autoimmune conditions such as systemic
lupus erythematosus (SLE). Accurate measurement of these
components is critical for proper clinical assessment.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENT AND HANDLING
Preferred Specimen:
• Serum collected in a red-top tube or serum separator tube (SST).
• The sample should be allowed to clot at room temperature for
15-30 minutes and then centrifuged promptly to separate serum.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Grossly hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
• Samples that are improperly labeled or collected in the wrong
type of tube.
Storage:
• Separated serum samples should be stored at 2-8°C if analysis is
to be performed within 72 hours.
• For longer storage, freeze at -20°C or below.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
A. Equipment:
• Clinical chemistry analyzer capable of running immunoassays
• Refrigerated centrifuge
• Micropipettes
• Vortex mixer
B. Reagents:
• Complement C3 and C4 ELISA reagent kits
• Anti-C1Q antibody ELISA reagent kits
• Calibrators, controls, and standards specified by the reagent
manufacturer
C. Supplies:
• Pipette tips
• Microtiter plates
• Wash buffer
• Dilution buffer
• Plate reader with wavelength-specific capabilities (typically at 450
nm)
1. PROCEDURE
A. Complement C3 and C4 Assay:
1. Allow all reagents, serum samples, and controls to reach room
temperature.
2. Prepare the microtiter plate according to the ELISA kit
instructions.
3. Dilute serum samples appropriately as per kit instructions.
Document any deviations in procedure.
4. Pipette the standards, controls, and patient samples into the
designated wells.
5. Follow the specific incubation times, washing steps, and
substrate addition as outlined in the manufacturer’s instructions.
6. Measure the absorbance at the appropriate wavelength using
the plate reader.
7. Generate a standard curve and calculate the concentration of
C3 and C4 in patient samples using the provided software or
manual calculation.
B. Anti-C1Q Antibody Assay:
1. Allow all reagents, serum samples, and controls to reach room
temperature.
2. Prepare the microtiter plate according to the ELISA kit
instructions.
3. Dilute serum samples appropriately as per kit instructions.
Document any deviations in procedure.
4. Pipette the standards, controls, and patient samples into the
designated wells.
5. Follow the specific incubation times, washing steps, and
substrate addition as outlined in the manufacturer’s instructions.
6. Measure the absorbance at the appropriate wavelength using
the plate reader.
7. Generate a standard curve and calculate the concentration of
Anti-C1Q antibodies in patient samples using the provided
software or manual calculation.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run positive and negative controls with each batch of tests to
ensure assay integrity.
• Monitor internal quality controls and if any of the controls fall
outside the acceptable range, troubleshoot the assay according to
the kit manufacturer’s recommendations.
• Document all QC activities, assessments, and corrective actions
in the laboratory quality control log.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results should be reviewed and verified by the technologist
before reporting.
• Report results to the Laboratory Information System (LIS) for
clinician access.
• Critical values should be communicated to the requesting clinician
as per laboratory policy.
1. REFERENCE RANGES AND INTERPRETATION
• Refer to clinical reference ranges provided with the ELISA kits or
established in the laboratory.
• Interpret the clinical significance of the results in conjunction with
the patient’s clinical presentation and other diagnostic procedures.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If assay signal is outside the expected range, repeat the test
ensuring strict adherence to the protocol.
• Review reagent expiration dates, storage conditions, and
preparation steps for possible errors.
• Consult with the kit manufacturer’s technical support for persistent
issues.
