Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Complement C3, Serum
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedures
for the analytical phase of generating results for Complement C3,
Serum testing in a CLIA-certified laboratory. This includes sample
preparation, reagent handling, instrument operation, quality control,
calibration, and result reporting.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
• All laboratory technologists performing Complement C3, Serum
assays are responsible for following this SOP.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring compliance with this
SOP and addressing any issues that arise during the testing
process.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Serum
• Collection Container: SST (Serum Separator Tube) or red-top
tube
• Stability:
◦ Room temperature: 8 hours
◦ Refrigerated (2-8°C): 48 hours
◦ Frozen (-20°C or below): 1 month
• Unacceptable Specimens:
◦ Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples
◦ Specimens collected in anticoagulant tubes
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Automated analyzer (e.g., nephelometer or ELISA reader)
• Complement C3 assay kit
• Calibrators and controls
• Reagent grade water
• Pipettes and tips
• Centrifuge
• Refrigerators and freezers for sample storage
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
5. PROCEDURE
A) SPECIMEN PREPARATION
1. Centrifuge the SST or red-top tube at 1500 x g for 10 minutes.
2. Transfer the serum to a clean, appropriately labeled sample
tube.
3. Refrigerate or freeze the serum sample based on the stability
requirements until ready for analysis.
B) REAGENT PREPARATION AND HANDLING
1. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for each reagent in the
Complement C3 assay kit.
2. Reconstitute lyophilized reagents if applicable, ensuring proper
mixing without introducing bubbles.
3. Store reagents according to the manufacturer’s guidelines,
noting expiration dates.
C) CALIBRATION AND QUALITY CONTROL
1. Perform calibration using the provided calibrators before
running any patient samples.
2. Run quality control samples at low, medium, and high levels at
the beginning of each shift or as defined by the laboratory’s
quality management system.
3. Record the results and verify that all controls are within the
acceptable range. If any control fails, investigate the cause,
take corrective action, and re-run controls before proceeding
with patient samples.
D) INSTRUMENT OPERATION
1. Turn on the automated analyzer and allow it to warm up as per
manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Load the reagents, calibrators, controls, and patient samples
onto the analyzer following the specified order outlined by the
manufacturer.
3. Initiate the run and monitor the instrument for any errors or
alerts.
E) RESULT ANALYSIS AND REPORTING
1. Upon completion of the analytical run, review the QC results to
ensure they are within acceptable limits before validating
patient results.
2. If QC results are acceptable, review patient results for any
anomalies or flags that indicate possible issues.
3. Release results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
for further review and reporting.
4. Document any issues encountered during the run and actions
taken to resolve them.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Daily quality control checks must ensure that the instruments and
reagents are functioning correctly.
• Monthly proficiency testing (PT) and participation in external
quality assessment (EQA) programs to ensure the accuracy of the
results.
• Routine maintenance and calibration of equipment as per
manufacturer recommendations and laboratory schedule.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results should be reported in mg/dL.
• Reference Range: 90-180 mg/dL
• Critical values should be reported to the clinician immediately as
per laboratory policy.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Interferences from hemolysis, lipemia, or icterus must be
considered.
• Improper sample storage and handling can affect the test results.
9. REFERENCES
• Complement C3 Assay Kit Manufacturer’s Instructions.
• Laboratory Quality Management System Manual.
• CLIA guidelines and regulations.
APPROVAL
• This protocol has been reviewed and approved by the Laboratory
Director and the Quality Assurance Manager as of October 2023.
This completes the SOP for the analytical phase of generating results
for Complement C3, Serum in a CLIA-certified laboratory. All
laboratory staff are required to read, understand, and adhere to this
SOP to ensure accurate and reliable test results.
