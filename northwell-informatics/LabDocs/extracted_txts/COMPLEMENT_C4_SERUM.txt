Standard Operating Procedure (SOP):
Complement C4, Serum Analysis
1. PURPOSE
To establish a standard procedure for the analysis of Complement C4
in serum, ensuring consistent, accurate, and reliable results.
Responsibility:
This procedure must be performed by trained laboratory personnel,
competent in handling serum samples and operating the specified
analytical instrumentation. The supervisor is responsible for ensuring
adherence to this procedure and addressing any issues that arise
during the process.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
• Preferred Specimen:
◦ Serum collected in a red top tube (without anticoagulant) or
serum separator tube (SST).
◦ Allow the blood to clot at room temperature for 30 minutes
before centrifugation.
• Stability:
◦ If analysis cannot be performed immediately, store the serum
at 2-8°C for up to 48 hours. For longer storage, freeze the
serum at -20°C or lower.
◦ Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed samples
• Lipemic samples
• Severely icteric samples
• Specimens collected in anticoagulant tubes (e.g., EDTA, heparin,
or citrate)
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Analytical instrument (e.g., nephelometer, immunoturbidimeter)
• Complement C4 reagent kit
• Controls (Low and High)
• Calibrators
• Centrifuge
• Micropipettes and tips
• Vortex mixer
• Specimen tubes
1. PROCEDURE
4.1 Preparation
1. Turn on the instrument and allow it to warm-up according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
2. Ensure that all reagents, controls, and calibrators are at the
appropriate temperature and properly mixed before use.
3. Analyze quality control (QC) materials to calibrate the
instrument before running patient samples.
4.2 Instrument Calibration
1. Prepare and run the calibrators according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
2. Verify that calibration meets acceptable criteria before
proceeding with patient samples.
3. Document calibration results.
4.3 Sample Analysis
1. Label the specimen tubes clearly with patient identifier.
2. Centrifuge the specimens at 1,500-2,000 x g for 10 minutes to
obtain clear serum.
3. Carefully transfer the serum to a clean tube, avoiding cellular
components.
4. Mix the serum samples gently on a vortex mixer.
5. Load serum samples, along with calibrators and controls, onto
the sample rack of the analyzer.
6. Program the analyzer for Complement C4 analysis and initiate
the run.
7. Review results for controls to ensure they are within acceptable
limits before releasing patient results.
8. If QC fails, troubleshoot the issue following manufacturer's
instructions and repeat analysis.
4.4 Troubleshooting
1. If calibration or QC fails, re-assess reagent integrity, sample
preparation, and instrument function.
2. Perform maintenance and re-calibration if necessary.
3. Document all troubleshooting steps taken and repeat the assay
as required.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
5. Use QC materials to verify assay performance for each run.
6. QC materials should include at least two levels: one within the
reference range (Low) and one elevated (High).
7. Review the QC results against the expected ranges, document
findings, and take corrective actions if necessary.
8. QC must be performed and documented according to CLIA
regulations and laboratory policies.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
10. Upon verification of QC and sample validity, results are
generated and reviewed.
11. Results must be reviewed for any flags or errors before
reporting.
12. Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS) and
verify.
13. Report results according to site-specific guidelines.
14. REFERENCE INTERVAL
• Complement C4, Serum: 10-40 mg/dL (can vary by population
and assay method; refer to kit insert for specific range)
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the manufacturer's reagent kit insert for limitations regarding
interferences and analytical specificity.
1. DOCUMENTATION
All calibration, quality control, and patient sample results should be
documented appropriately in SOP logs and the LIS.
1. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS
2. Handle all biological specimens as potentially infectious.
3. Follow all laboratory safety guidelines for the use of reagents
and instrument maintenance.
4. Use personal protective equipment (PPE) including gloves, lab
coat, and eye protection.
