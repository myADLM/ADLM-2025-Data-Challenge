Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Complement, Total,
Serum Analysis
1. PURPOSE
This standard operating procedure (SOP) outlines the steps and
responsibilities involved in the analytical phase for generating results
for Complement, Total, Serum (C3 and C4) to ensure accuracy,
precision, and reliability of laboratory results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
• All designated laboratory personnel must adhere to this SOP for
handling serum complement tests.
• The designated supervisor must ensure that all staff are trained
and maintain adherence to the outlined procedures.
3. DEFINITIONS
• Complement: A group of serum proteins that play a vital role in
the immune response.
• C3 and C4: Major components measured for assessing the
complement system status.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Type of specimen:
• Serum
Collection:
• Ensure that blood is collected in a serum separator tube (SST) or
a plain red-top tube.
• After collection, allow blood to clot by leaving it undisturbed at
room temperature for 15-30 minutes.
• Centrifuge the specimen at 1,300-1,800 x g for 10-15 minutes to
separate the serum.
• Transfer the serum into a clean, labeled transport tube if using a
plain red-top tube.
• The serum must be free of hemolysis and lipemia.
Stability:
• Room temperature: 48 hours
• Refrigerated (2-8°C): 7 days
• Frozen (-20°C or lower): 28 days
5. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation
1. Bring all reagents and samples to room temperature before
commencing the test.
2. Calibrate and perform routine maintenance checks on the
analyzer as per the manufacturer’s instructions.
3. Prepare the necessary controls (high, normal, and low) for
quality control testing.
B. Analyzer Setup
1. Confirm that the analyzer setup conforms with the
manufacturer's guidelines.
2. Load the prepared patient samples, calibrators, and controls
onto the analyzer.
3. Ensure reagents are loaded correctly in the designated
position. Typical reagents needed include:
◦ Calibrator diluent
◦ Sample diluent
◦ Complement reagent
◦ Reaction buffer
C. Quality Control
1. Run quality control samples at the beginning of each analytical
run.
2. Ensure results fall within the acceptable range. If QC falls
outside the range, identify and correct the source of error
before processing patient samples.
D. Sample Analysis
1. Initiate the run sequence on the analyzer.
2. For each sample, the analyzer will automatically:
◦ Mix the serum sample with the complement reagents.
◦ Measure the absorbance to quantify C3 and C4
components.
◦ Calculate results based on calibration data.
E. Results Verification
1. Upon completion, review all results for flagged or out-of-range
values.
2. Apply repeat analysis protocols for samples with questionable
results to ensure accuracy.
F. Corrective Actions
1. For samples demonstrating analytical interference (e.g.,
hemolysis), explain and recommend sample recollection.
2. Notify the designated supervisor if persistent issues arise with
repeated QC failures or equipment malfunctions.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Results should be automatically transmitted to the Lab
Information System (LIS).
2. The technologist must review and verify results prior to final
acceptance.
3. All critical values should be reported following the laboratory’s
reporting policy.
7. METHODOLOGY LIMITATIONS
1. Ensure software and reagent versions are up to date to prevent
systematic biases.
2. Refer to the product insert for details on interfering substances
and specific considerations for accurate analysis.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Record all QC and patient results in the appropriate QC and
patient logs.
2. Archive maintenance logs, calibration data, and control plots as
part of the quality management documentation.
3. Perform regular external proficiency tests and method
validations to ensure the methodology's reliability.

REVIEW AND REVISION
• This SOP should be reviewed annually or as needed based on
updates in testing methods or laboratory requirements.
• All amendments should be documented and approved by the
laboratory director or authorized personnel.
