Standard Operating Procedure for Complete Blood Cell Count
(CBC) with Differential Analysis
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to outline the steps for performing a
Complete Blood Cell Count (CBC) with differential using an
automated hematology analyzer. This ensures accurate, reliable, and
reproducible results for clinical diagnostics.
Responsibility: All laboratory personnel performing CBC analysis
and entering results are responsible for following this SOP.
Supervisors are responsible for ensuring compliance with this
protocol.
2. DEFINITION
Complete Blood Cell Count with differential (CBC with diff) includes
the quantitative determination of the following:
• White Blood Cell (WBC) Count
• Red Blood Cell (RBC) Count
• Hemoglobin (Hgb)
• Hematocrit (Hct)
• Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV)
• Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin (MCH)
• Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin Concentration (MCHC)
• Red Cell Distribution Width (RDW)
• Platelet Count (PLT)
• Automated differential counts for neutrophils, lymphocytes,
monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils
3. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Automated Hematology Analyzer (examples include Sysmex,
Beckman Coulter, Abbott)
• Quality Control materials
• Calibrators if required as per manufacturer’s instructions
• Reagents specific to the analyzer, e.g., diluents, staining
solutions, lysing agents
• Disposable sample cups or tubes if required
• Personal protective equipment (PPE), including lab coat, gloves,
face shield/goggles
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
• Preferred specimen: Whole blood collected in EDTA (lavender
top) tubes
• Minimum acceptable volume: As specified by the hematology
analyzer manufacturer
• Stability: Specimens should be analyzed within 8 hours if stored
at room temperature or within 24 hours if refrigerated at 2-8°C.
**Unacceptable specimens:**
• Clotted specimens
• Hemolyzed samples
• Samples in inappropriate collection tubes (e.g., sodium citrate,
heparin)
5. PROCEDURE
5.1 Calibration:
• Perform calibration of the hematology analyzer as per the
manufacturer’s guidelines.
• Document the calibration procedure and results.
5.2 Quality Control:
• Run quality control materials daily before patient sample analysis
to ensure the analyzer is functioning properly. Use at least two
levels of QC (normal and abnormal).
• Document and review QC results. Investigate any QC results that
fall outside the acceptable range before proceeding with patient
samples.
5.3 Sample Analysis:
• Carefully mix the patient EDTA tube by gently inverting it 8-10
times. Avoid excessive shaking.
• Place the EDTA tube onto the analyzer’s sample rack or into the
sample rotor, following the manufacturer's instructions.
• Select the appropriate CBC with differential mode on the analyzer.
• Enter or scan the patient identification information.
• Press the start button to initiate the analysis.
• Retrieve and review the printed or electronic result once the
analysis is complete.
5.4 Interpretation and Documentation:
• Compare the analyzer printout with reference intervals and flag
any abnormal results.
• Verify flagged results and review any delta checks according to
the laboratory policy.
• Perform manual review of the blood smear and differential count
under a microscope if required or flagged by the analyzer.
5.5 Reporting:
• Enter validated results into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
• Communicate critical values immediately to the relevant
healthcare provider as per laboratory policy. Document the
communication details.
5.6 Maintenance:
• Perform routine maintenance on the analyzer as specified in the
manufacturer’s manual.
• Document all maintenance activities in the appropriate logbook.
5.7 Troubleshooting:
• Refer to the manufacturer’s troubleshooting guide if issues occur
with sample analysis.
• Document all troubleshooting steps taken and the resolution of
the issue.
5.8 Waste Disposal:
• Dispose of all biological and chemical wastes in accordance with
the laboratory’s biosafety and waste management protocols.
6. QUALITY ASSURANCE
• Participate in external quality assessment (EQA) or proficiency
testing programs to ensure the accuracy and reliability of
analytical results.
• Review quality metrics regularly and take corrective action as
needed for continuous improvement.
7. TRAINING
• Ensure all new personnel are trained on this SOP and
demonstrate competency before performing CBC with differential
analysis independently.
• Conduct regular competency assessments to ensure ongoing
proficiency.
