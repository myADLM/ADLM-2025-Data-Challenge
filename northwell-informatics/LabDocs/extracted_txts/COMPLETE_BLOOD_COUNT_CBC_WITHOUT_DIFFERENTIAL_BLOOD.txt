Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Complete Blood Count
(CBC) Without Differential
1. PURPOSE
This procedure describes the process for performing a Complete
Blood Count (CBC) without differential. The CBC assay quantifies the
cellular components of blood including red blood cells (RBCs),
hemoglobin (Hb), hematocrit (Hct), white blood cells (WBCs), and
platelets (PLTs). The procedure ensures accurate and precise
measurement of these blood components using an automated
hematology analyzer.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing and
documenting the CBC assays, ensuring the accuracy and reliability of
results, maintaining and calibrating the analytical equipment as
required, and adhering to the specific procedures detailed in this
SOP.
1. DEFINITIONS
CBC (Complete Blood Count) without differential: A laboratory test
that provides information about the number and quality of red blood
cells, white blood cells, and platelets in a blood sample, but does not
differentiate between the types of white blood cells.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Automated hematology analyzer (e.g., Sysmex, Beckman Coulter,
or equivalent)
• Blood collection tubes containing EDTA anticoagulant (Lavender-
top)
• Quality control materials (low, normal, high)
• Calibrators
• Personal protective equipment (gloves, lab coat, face shield)
1. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation and Handling
1. Verify that the specimen is labeled correctly with the patient’s
information and collection time.
2. Inspect the sample to ensure it is free of clots. Gently invert the
EDTA tube 8-10 times to mix the blood thoroughly.
3. Ensure that the analyzer is turned on, calibrated, and quality
control materials have been run and are within acceptable
ranges.
B. Instrument Operation
1. Access the CBC assay menu on the hematology analyzer.
2. Load the EDTA blood sample onto the analyzer’s sample loader
or probe following manufacturer’s instructions.
3. Initiate the analysis by selecting the appropriate sample assay
option on the analyzer’s interface.
4. Verify the completion of the analysis and confirmation of the
results generation.
5. Document any error messages or instrument alerts and take
appropriate action to resolve them as per manufacturer's
troubleshooting guide.
C. Quality Control
1. Run quality control (QC) materials at the beginning of each
shift, after maintenance, and whenever results are in question.
2. Ensure that all QC results are within the established ranges
before proceeding with patient samples.
3. Document QC results and take corrective actions if QC results
fall outside of the acceptable ranges.
D. Result Review and Verification
1. Review the complete blood count results for each patient
sample carefully.
2. Confirm that all parameters, including WBC, RBC, Hb, Hct,
MCV, MCH, MCHC, RDW, and PLT, are within the expected
ranges.
3. Compare values with previous results for consistency, and
evaluate any significant changes or outliers.
4. If results are flagged by the instrument for review (e.g., due to
error codes or abnormal values), follow up with a manual peer
review or re-run the sample.
5. Ensure that results are electronically transmitted to the LIS
(Laboratory Information System) where they are to be
automatically reviewed and verified by a qualified technologist.
E. Troubleshooting
1. Address any instrument-generated errors by following the
manufacturer's troubleshooting guide.
2. If the same error persists, consult with the designated
supervisor or contact the manufacturer’s technical support.
3. Document all troubleshooting actions taken.
4. REPORTING RESULTS
5. Ensure that the CBC results are reviewed and verified before
being released to the patient’s medical record.
6. Document any critical values and follow the procedure for
reporting critical results, including immediate notification to the
attending clinician.
7. Maintain accurate records of all results, including sample ID,
date, and technologist ID in the LIS.
8. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• WBC: 4.0 – 11.0 x 10^3/µL
• RBC (Males): 4.6 – 6.0 x 10^6/µL
• RBC (Females): 4.2 – 5.4 x 10^6/µL
• Hemoglobin (Males): 13.5 – 17.5 g/dL
• Hemoglobin (Females): 12.0 – 16.0 g/dL
• Hematocrit (Males): 41 – 53%
• Hematocrit (Females): 36 – 46%
• MCV: 80 – 100 fL
• MCH: 27 – 33 pg
• MCHC: 32 – 36 g/dL
• RDW: 11.5 – 14.5%
• Platelets: 150 – 450 x 10^3/µL
1. QUALITY CONTROL AND MAINTENANCE
2. Ensure that routine maintenance and calibration of the
hematology analyzer are performed as specified by the
manufacturer.
3. Perform routine maintenance tasks, including cleaning and
reagent replacement, according to the manufacturer’s
guidelines.
4. Document all maintenance actions and retain maintenance
records for review.
5. LIMITATIONS
6. Proper sample collection and handling are critical to ensure
accurate results.
7. Samples with clots, hemolysis, or improper anticoagulant usage
may yield inaccurate results.
8. Extreme leukocytosis or thrombocytosis may interfere with
accurate readings and require alternative verification methods.
