Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Complete Blood Count
(CBC) with Differential
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedures for performing Complete Blood Count
(CBC) with Differential analysis on whole blood specimens, ensuring
reliable and accurate test results.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred Specimen:
• Whole blood collected in EDTA (lavender top) tubes.
Specimen Stability:
• Room Temperature: Stable for 24 hours.
• Refrigerated at 2-8°C: Stable for 48 hours.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Clotted samples.
• Specimens more than 48 hours post-collection.
• Hemolyzed samples.
3. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
• CBC Analyzer (e.g., Sysmex XN-Series)
• EDTA blood collection tubes
• Quality control materials (Normal, Low, High)
• Calibrators
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
4. PROCEDURE
A. Daily Startup and Maintenance:
1. Turn on the CBC analyzer and perform a system check
according to the manufacturer's instructions.
2. Ensure the reagents are within the expiry date and properly
loaded in the analyzer.
3. Perform daily quality control (QC) using normal, low, and high
controls.
◦ Record the QC results in the QC log.
◦ Ensure all controls are within acceptable range before
proceeding with patient samples.
◦ If QC results are out of range, troubleshoot and resolve
issues prior to testing patient samples.
B. Specimen Processing:
1. Verify the specimen integrity:
◦ Check for clots, hemolysis, or any labeling discrepancies.
2. Gently invert the EDTA tube 8-10 times to ensure the sample is
thoroughly mixed.
3. Load the sample into the CBC analyzer according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
C. Performing the CBC with Differential:
1. Enter the patient information into the analyzer or the Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
2. Initiate the analysis by following the analyzer’s start procedure.
3. Review the CBC results on the analyzer screen for any flags or
errors.
D. Review and Validation of Results:
1. Evaluate the analyzer’s flags and review any flagged results for
manual smear review or repeat analysis as indicated.
2. For results requiring verification:
◦ Perform a manual differential using a properly prepared
peripheral blood smear.
◦ Stain the slide using an appropriate hematology stain (e.g.,
Wright-Giemsa stain).
◦ Review the smear under the microscope and count 100
white cells, recording the differential.
◦ Verify and reconcile the manual count with the analyzer's
output.
3. Troubleshooting:
◦ Any irregularities or errors in results should be investigated.
◦ If necessary, repeat the analysis on a duplicate sample or
perform a manual differential.
5. REPORTING RESULTS
A. Automatic Transmission:
• Results are automatically transmitted to the LIS following
validation by the technologist.
• Critical results are flagged and require immediate attention.
B. Critical Values:
• Critical results must be reviewed and verified promptly.
• Report critical values according to the lab's critical value policy
and ensure appropriate clinical notification.
6. QUALITY CONTROL AND CALIBRATION
1. Quality Control:
◦ Perform QC with each new lot and after analyzer
maintenance or service.
◦ Record and review QC results daily.
◦ If QC is out of range, investigate and resolve issues before
processing any patient samples.
2. Calibration:
◦ Perform calibration according to the manufacturer’s
recommendations or if the analyzer fails QC repeatedly.
◦ Document all calibration activities and results.
7. MAINTENANCE OF EQUIPMENT
1. Follow routine maintenance schedules as recommended by the
analyzer manufacturer.
2. Document all maintenance activities in the maintenance log.
8. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS
1. Wear appropriate PPE (lab coat, gloves, eye protection) when
handling specimens.
2. Follow biosafety protocols when dealing with potentially
infectious materials.
3. Dispose of all waste materials including used slides, tubes, and
biohazard waste according to institutional and governmental
safety guidelines.

10. DOCUMENTATION
Ensure all records including specimen logs, QC logs, maintenance
logs, and calibration records are maintained and readily accessible.
By adhering to this SOP, laboratory personnel can ensure that CBC
with Differential testing is conducted consistently, accurately, and
safely, thereby maintaining high standards of patient care and
diagnostic accuracy.
