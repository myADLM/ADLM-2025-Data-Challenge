STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP) TITLE: Analytical
Phase for Complete Blood Count (CBC) Testing Using Percutaneous
Umbilical Cord Blood Sampling (PUBS)
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this protocol is to outline the
procedures required for the accurate and reliable analytical
phase in generating Complete Blood Count (CBC) results from
percutaneous umbilical cord blood sampling (PUBS).
2. SCOPE This SOP applies to all laboratory staff involved in the
analysis, documentation, and reporting of CBC results derived
from PUBS samples.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Designated laboratory staff receive umbilical cord blood samples
and perform CBC analysis as defined in this procedure.
• Laboratory supervisors ensure compliance with this procedure
and address any deviations or issues identified.
1. DEFINITIONS
• Complete Blood Count (CBC): A laboratory test providing
information about the cellular components of blood including white
blood cells (WBC), red blood cells (RBC), hemoglobin (Hb),
hematocrit (Hct), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean
corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), mean corpuscular hemoglobin
concentration (MCHC), red cell distribution width (RDW), and
platelet count.
• Percutaneous Umbilical Cord Blood Sampling (PUBS): A
procedure to extract blood from the fetal umbilical cord using a
needle guided by ultrasound.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Hematology Analyzer: Capable of providing a full CBC panel.
• Blood Collection Tubes: K2EDTA tubes specifically designed for
the collection and preservation of umbilical cord blood.
• Quality Control Materials: Commercially available control
materials to ensure the accuracy and reliability of CBC results.
• Pipettes and Other Labware: For handling samples.
1. PROCEDURE
6.1 Specimen Collection
• Specimen: PUBS-derived cord blood sample collected in K2EDTA
tubes to prevent clotting.
• Unacceptable Specimens: Specimens with clots, hemolysis,
insufficient volume, or without proper labeling.
6.2 Specimen Transport and Storage
• Transport specimens immediately to the laboratory while
maintaining consistent temperature control (2-8°C).
• If analysis is delayed, store specimens at 2-8°C and process
within 24 hours of collection.
6.3 Specimen Preparation
• Upon receipt, gently invert the K2EDTA tube 8-10 times to mix the
blood and anticoagulant thoroughly.
• Inspect the specimen for any visible clots, hemolysis, or other
issues that may affect the analysis. Document any discrepancies
and notify the supervisor.
6.4 Analytical Processing
• Power on and calibrate the hematology analyzer according to the
manufacturer’s specifications.
• Perform daily quality control checks using commercial control
materials. Ensure that QC results are within acceptable ranges
before proceeding with patient samples.
• Load the specimen into the analyzer: a. Gently mix the sample
again by inverting the tube. b. Ensure the tube is properly inserted
into the analyzer's sample port. c. Follow the analyzer’s
operational instructions to initiate the analysis.
6.5 Data Acquisition and Review
• Allow the analyzer to process the sample and generate the CBC
results.
• Review the results for any flags or messages indicating possible
errors (e.g., sample quality issues, out-of-range values).
• Verify that critical parameters (WBC, RBC, Hb, Hct, etc.) fall
within expected ranges. If values are outside the expected range,
perform a secondary review and consider a repeat analysis.
6.6 Result Reporting
• Once verified, results are automatically or manually transmitted to
the laboratory information system (LIS).
• Ensure results are accurately entered into the patient record and
double-check for transcription errors.
• If results indicate critical values, notify the attending clinician
immediately as per the critical value reporting guidelines.
6.7 Quality Control and Documentation
• Maintain detailed records of all QC procedures, instrument
maintenance, and any corrective actions taken.
• Archive all patient reports and QC documentation according to
laboratory policies and regulatory requirements.
6.8 Troubleshooting
• If any problems arise (e.g., equipment malfunction, recurrent QC
failures), follow standard troubleshooting procedures: a. Refer to
the manufacturer’s manual for initial guidance. b. Consult with the
laboratory supervisor and document any findings. c. If issues
persist, contact the equipment service representative for further
assistance.
