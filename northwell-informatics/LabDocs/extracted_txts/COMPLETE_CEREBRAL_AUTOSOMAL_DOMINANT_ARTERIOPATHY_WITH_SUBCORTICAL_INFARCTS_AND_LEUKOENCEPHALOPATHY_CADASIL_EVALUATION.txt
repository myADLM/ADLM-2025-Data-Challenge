Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
CADASIL Evaluation
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this protocol is to describe the analytical phase of
generating results for Complete Cerebral Autosomal Dominant
Arteriopathy with Subcortical Infarcts and Leukoencephalopathy
(CADASIL) evaluation. This procedure ensures that genetic testing
for CADASIL is performed accurately, consistently, and reliably.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing the
genetic testing following this protocol. All personnel involved in this
procedure must be adequately trained and competent in molecular
genetic techniques.
2. DEFINITIONS
• CADASIL: A hereditary stroke disorder caused by mutations in the
NOTCH3 gene.
• NOTCH3: The gene primarily implicated in CADASIL; mutations in
this gene are typically evaluated to confirm a diagnosis.
• PCR: Polymerase Chain Reaction, a molecular technique used to
amplify selected DNA sequences.
• Sequencing: Determining the exact sequence of a specific DNA
segment.
3. PROCEDURE
A) Reagents, Equipment, and Supplies:
1. PCR reagents (dNTPs, primers specific for NOTCH3 exons,
Taq polymerase, buffer)
2. DNA extraction kits
3. Molecular grade water
4. Agarose gel electrophoresis supplies
5. Sequencing reagents
6. PCR thermocycler
7. DNA sequencer
8. Microcentrifuge tubes
9. DNA ladder or size standards
10. Pipettes and tips
11. Laboratory notebook and tracking forms
B) DNA Extraction:
1. Extract genomic DNA from patient’s blood or tissue samples
using a validated DNA extraction kit.
◦ Ensure DNA concentration and purity are adequate and
record in the laboratory notebook.
◦ Store extracted DNA at -20°C until analysis.
C) PCR Amplification of NOTCH3 Exons:
1. Design and validate specific primers for exons of the NOTCH3
gene implicated in CADASIL.
2. Prepare the PCR master mix per reaction:
◦ 10 µL of ReadyMix (2X)
◦ 1 µL of forward primer (10 µM)
◦ 1 µL of reverse primer (10 µM)
◦ 1 µL of template DNA (typically 50 ng)
◦ 7 µL of molecular grade water
3. Run the PCR with the following cycle:
◦ Initial Denaturation: 95°C for 5 minutes
◦ Denaturation: 95°C for 30 seconds
◦ Annealing: 60°C for 30 seconds (adjust if necessary)
◦ Extension: 72°C for 1 minute (40 cycles)
◦ Final Extension: 72°C for 10 minutes
4. Validate amplification by running PCR products on a 1.5%
agarose gel through electrophoresis.
◦ Include negative controls (no DNA template) to ensure lack
of contamination.
◦ Visualize bands under UV light and document results in the
laboratory notebook.
D) Sequencing of PCR Products:
1. Purify PCR products using a PCR purification kit.
2. Prepare sequencing reactions using appropriate sequencing
reagents and purified PCR products.
3. Load samples onto a DNA sequencer following the
manufacturer’s instructions.
4. Perform sequencing and obtain raw data output.
E) Data Analysis and Interpretation:
1. Analyze the sequencing results using bioinformatics tools to
identify NOTCH3 mutations.
◦ Compare sequence data against a reference NOTCH3
sequence.
◦ Evaluate identified variants for pathogenicity using
appropriate databases (e.g., ClinVar, HGMD).
2. Confirm the identified mutation’s association with CADASIL
based on literature and mutation databases.
3. Document the findings and prepare a detailed report for
medical professionals.
◦ Include references to the databases, tools used, and
rationale for variant interpretation.
F) Quality Control:
1. Implement internal controls in each PCR and sequencing run
(positive control with known NOTCH3 mutation and a negative
control).
2. Regularly perform instrument calibration and maintenance.
3. Validate and document the reagents and supplies used at each
stage.
G) Reporting Results:
1. Review and verify results before issuing the final report.
2. Report critical findings to the requesting physician immediately.
3. Issue the detailed report including:
◦ Patient ID and sample ID
◦ Description of the mutation(s) identified
◦ Clinical significance of the mutation(s)
◦ Methodologies used
◦ References and interpretation notes
◦ Date and signature of the laboratory scientist and supervisor
H) Maintenance of Records:
1. Maintain all laboratory records including raw data, gel images,
sequencing files, and reports for a minimum period as required
by institutional and regulatory guidelines.
2. Ensure proper storage and confidentiality of patient data.

By adhering to this SOP, the laboratory ensures high standards for
the accurate evaluation of CADASIL, ultimately aiding in appropriate
clinical management.
