Standard Operating Procedure for Comprehensive Arrhythmia
and Cardiomyopathy Gene Panel, Various
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedures for the analytical
phase of generating results for the Comprehensive Arrhythmia and
Cardiomyopathy Gene Panel, Various, which includes the
preparation, sequencing, data analysis, and result review. This
ensures that all steps are performed consistently and accurately to
maintain the quality and reliability of test results.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory staff with training in molecular genetics and
next-generation sequencing (NGS) are responsible for performing
the procedures outlined in this SOP.
• It is the responsibility of all staff to identify any discrepancies or
issues during the analytical phase and to bring them to the
attention of a supervisor.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring that the procedures are
followed and documented correctly, including any corrective
actions.
2. DEFINITION
The Comprehensive Arrhythmia and Cardiomyopathy Gene Panel is
a test that analyzes multiple genes associated with arrhythmias and
cardiomyopathies using next-generation sequencing technology.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Next-Generation Sequencer (e.g., Illumina, Thermo Fisher)
• DNA Extraction Kit
• Library Preparation Kit
• Target Enrichment Kit
• Reaction Tubes and Plates
• Pipettes and Pipette Tips
• Thermal Cycler
• Microcentrifuge
• Qubit Fluorometer or equivalent for DNA quantification
• Bioanalyzer or Tapestation for DNA quality assessment
• Reagents for PCR and sequencing
4. PROCEDURE
A) DNA Extraction:
1. Obtain a specimen (e.g., blood, saliva) and ensure it has been
properly accessioned.
2. Extract genomic DNA using a validated DNA extraction kit
according to the manufacturer's instructions.
3. Quantify extracted DNA using a Qubit fluorometer or equivalent
and assess DNA quality using a Bioanalyzer or Tapestation.
4. Document DNA concentration and quality metrics.
B) Library Preparation:
1. Prepare DNA libraries using a validated library preparation kit
following the manufacturer's protocol.
2. Perform quality control checks on the prepared libraries,
including quantification and size assessment.
3. Proceed to target enrichment using an appropriate target
enrichment kit specific for the arrhythmia and cardiomyopathy
genes.
4. Amplify the enriched targets via PCR and perform additional
quality checks.
C) Sequencing:
1. Load the prepared and enriched libraries onto the next-
generation sequencer according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
2. Set up the sequencing run with the appropriate parameters and
initiate sequencing.
3. Monitor the sequencing process to ensure it is running
smoothly and troubleshoot any issues as they arise.
D) Data Analysis:
1. Once sequencing is complete, transfer raw sequencing data to
a bioinformatics workstation.
2. Analyze sequencing data using validated bioinformatics
pipelines to perform quality control, sequence alignment,
variant calling, and annotation.
3. Review the quality metrics of the sequencing run to ensure
sufficient coverage and read depth for all target regions.
E) Result Review and Interpretation:
1. Review the annotated variant list to identify pathogenic or likely
pathogenic variants relevant to arrhythmias and
cardiomyopathies.
2. Confirm the presence of clinically significant variants using
Sanger sequencing or another secondary method as
necessary.
3. Compile a comprehensive report including identified variants,
their clinical significance, and any recommended follow-up
actions.
4. Have the report reviewed and signed off by a qualified
geneticist or pathologist.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
• Ensure that all reagents and equipment used are within their
expiration dates and are functioning correctly.
• Perform routine maintenance and calibration on the sequencers
and other laboratory equipment.
• Use positive and negative controls in the library preparation,
enrichment, and sequencing steps to monitor the process.
• Document all quality control results and any deviations from the
protocol along with corrective actions taken.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
Results are generated and compiled into a formal report, which is
then reviewed and verified by a designated geneticist or pathologist.
The final report is transmitted to the referring physician or clinician
through the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
