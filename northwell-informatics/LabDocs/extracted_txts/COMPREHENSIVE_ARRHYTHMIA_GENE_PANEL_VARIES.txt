Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase Protocol for Generating Results for
Comprehensive Arrhythmia Gene Panel, Varies
Effective Date: [Insert Date] Review Date: [Insert Date] Version:
1.0
1. PURPOSE
This protocol establishes the standard procedures for the analytical
phase of generating and validating results for the Comprehensive
Arrhythmia Gene Panel, Varies. This ensures accuracy, reliability, and
proper documentation of genetic testing results.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel involved in the
analysis of DNA samples for arrhythmia-related genetic variants
using next-generation sequencing (NGS).
3. RESPONSIBILITIES
• Laboratory Technologists/Analysts: Execute analytical
procedures, monitor equipment, document findings, and perform
validation checks.
• Bioinformatics Personnel: Analyze sequencing data, confirm
variant calls, and ensure data integrity.
• Supervisors/Quality Assurance: Review and approve results,
oversee quality control, and ensure protocol compliance.
4. DEFINITIONS
• Comprehensive Arrhythmia Gene Panel: A targeted next-
generation sequencing test assessing multiple genes associated
with arrhythmias.
• NGS: Next-Generation Sequencing, a method of DNA sequencing
capable of sequencing multiple genes simultaneously with high
throughput.
• LIS: Laboratory Information System, a software system that
records, manages, and stores data related to laboratory
operations.
5. EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS
• NGS Platform (e.g., Illumina MySeq, NextSeq)
• DNA Extraction Kits
• Library Preparation Kits
• Thermal Cycler
• Reagents for NGS (e.g., primers, enzymes)
• Computer with bioinformatics analysis software (e.g., GATK,
Annovar, IGV)
• Laboratory Information System (LIS)
6. PROCEDURE
A. DNA Extraction and Quantification
1. Extract DNA from the provided samples using the designated
DNA extraction kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Quantify the extracted DNA using a fluorometric method (e.g.,
Qubit) and assess purity using spectrophotometry (e.g.,
NanoDrop).
B. Library Preparation
1. Perform library preparation using the designated library
preparation kit, following the manufacturer’s protocols.
2. Assess the quality and quantity of the prepared library using a
bioanalyzer or equivalent system.
C. Sequencing
1. Load the prepared libraries onto the sequencing platform
following the manufacturer’s guidelines.
2. Configure the sequencing run parameters specific to the
arrhythmia gene panel.
3. Start the sequencing run and monitor for any errors. Notify the
supervisor immediately if any issues arise.
D. Data Analysis
1. Upon completion of the sequencing run, retrieve raw data
(FASTQ files) from the sequencing platform.
2. Perform quality control checks on the raw data using software
such as FastQC.
3. Align the sequences to the reference genome (e.g., hg19 or
hg38) using an aligner (e.g., BWA-MEM).
4. Perform variant calling using appropriate software (e.g., GATK),
and generate a variant call file (VCF).
5. Annotate the variants using tools (e.g., Annovar) to predict
functional impacts.
6. Filter and prioritize variants based on clinical significance
related to arrhythmias.
E. Result Validation and Reporting
1. Validate identified variants by reviewing alignment and variant
call data using IGV (Integrated Genome Viewer).
2. Confirm clinical relevance by cross-referencing with databases
(e.g., ClinVar, HGMD) and primary literature.
3. Interpret variants per ACMG guidelines and classify
(Pathogenic, Likely Pathogenic, VUS, etc.).
4. Enter finalized results into the LIS with proper documentation.
5. Generate a comprehensive report summarizing findings,
interpretations, and recommendations.
6. Obtain supervisor or qualified personnel’s review and approval
before releasing results.
F. Quality Control
1. Include positive and negative controls in every run to ensure
test accuracy.
2. Perform proficiency testing regularly as per CLIA requirements.
3. Document all QC activities and corrective actions in the Quality
Control Log.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
Report comprehensive results through LIS with the following details:
• Gene and variant identified
• Zygosity of the variant (heterozygous, homozygous)
• Clinical significance classification
• Interpretation and recommendations for clinical management
