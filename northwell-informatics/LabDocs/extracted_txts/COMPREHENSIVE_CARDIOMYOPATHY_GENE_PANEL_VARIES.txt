Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Comprehensive
Cardiomyopathy Gene Panel, Varies
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this procedure is to outline the
analytical phase protocol for generating results for the
Comprehensive Cardiomyopathy Gene Panel test. This test aims to
detect genetic variants that may contribute to cardiomyopathy.
2. SCOPE This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel responsible
for performing the Comprehensive Cardiomyopathy Gene Panel test
in a CLIA-certified laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY It is the responsibility of the laboratory
personnel to follow this SOP to ensure the accuracy and reliability of
the test results. The laboratory supervisor is responsible for ensuring
compliance with this SOP and providing necessary training to staff.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Next-Generation Sequencer (NGS) or equivalent
• PCR machine
• Reagents for DNA extraction
• Library preparation kit
• Target enrichment kit
• Sequencing reagents
• Bioinformatics software
• Quality control materials
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred specimen: Peripheral blood in EDTA (lavender top tube)
• Minimum volume: 5 mL
• Specimen handling: Store at 2-8°C and transport to the laboratory
as soon as possible
6. PROCEDURE
6.1. DNA Extraction a. Obtain the peripheral blood sample collected
in an EDTA tube. b. Perform DNA extraction using an appropriate
commercial DNA extraction kit according to the manufacturer's
instructions. c. Verify DNA concentration and purity using a
spectrophotometer (e.g., Nanodrop) or fluorometer.
6.2. Library Preparation a. Quantify the genomic DNA and
normalize to the desired concentration. b. Perform library preparation
using the library preparation kit. c. Amplify the regions of interest
using PCR. d. Perform target enrichment using the target enrichment
kit. e. Quantify and verify the quality of the libraries using a
bioanalyzer or equivalent instrument.
6.3. Sequencing a. Pool the libraries and load them onto the
sequencing platform according to the manufacturer's instructions. b.
Perform sequencing run according to platform guidelines. c. Monitor
the sequencing run for quality indicators such as read length, read
depth, and error rates.
6.4. Data Analysis a. Transfer raw sequencing data to the
bioinformatics pipeline. b. Perform primary data analysis to generate
FASTQ files from raw sequencing data. c. Perform secondary data
analysis, including alignment to reference genome, calling of single
nucleotide variants (SNVs), insertions, deletions (indels), and
structural variants. d. Annotate the variants using suitable annotation
software.
6.5. Interpretation and Reporting a. Review the identified variants
in the context of cardiomyopathy using available databases and
literature. b. Classify the clinical significance of each variant (e.g.,
pathogenic, likely pathogenic, benign, likely benign, variant of
uncertain significance). c. Generate a report including the list of
identified variants and their clinical significance. d. Review the report
for accuracy, attach quality control data, and sign off by the
supervising geneticist or pathologist.
7. QUALITY CONTROL a. Include positive and negative controls in
each run to ensure assay performance. b. Verify the performance of
the sequencing platform using internal quality control materials. c.
Document and review each step of the process in the laboratory
information system (LIS).
8. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's instructions for DNA extraction, library preparation,
target enrichment, and sequencing reagents.
• Bioinformatics analysis software documentation.
• Current literature and databases relevant to cardiomyopathy
genetics.
9. DOCUMENTATION a. Record all relevant information, including
reagent lot numbers, equipment ID, and quality control data. b. Store
all records according to the laboratory’s documentation retention
policy.
10. SAFETY a. Follow all laboratory safety protocols, including the
use of personal protective equipment (PPE). b. Dispose of all
biological waste according to the laboratory’s waste disposal
guidelines.
11. TROUBLESHOOTING a. If any step yields unexpected results or
fails quality control checks, review the procedure, check reagents,
and equipment, and repeat the step if necessary.
12. REVIEW CYCLE This SOP will be reviewed annually or
whenever changes in protocols or reagents occur.
By implementing this protocol, laboratory personnel will ensure the
accurate and reliable generation of results for the Comprehensive
Cardiomyopathy Gene Panel test.
