Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Comprehensive Cerebrovascular Gene Panel Testing
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this SOP is to outline the
procedures for the analytical phase of generating results for the
Comprehensive Cerebrovascular Gene Panel. This panel is
designed to identify genetic variants associated with
cerebrovascular diseases.
Responsibility:
• Qualified laboratory personnel are responsible for carrying out the
analytical procedures in accordance with this SOP.
• It is the responsibility of the supervising molecular geneticist to
review the results and ensure all quality control measures are met
before the results are reported.
• All personnel involved should be familiar with this SOP and
conduct all analysis with adherence to CLIA guidelines.
1. SPECIMEN Acceptable Specimen Types:
• Peripheral blood collected in EDTA tubes.
• Buccal swab.
• Saliva sample collected in an approved DNA preservation kit.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimen types not listed as acceptable.
• Specimens that are hemolyzed, clotted, or improperly labeled.
• Specimens collected in containers or tubes not specified for
molecular genetic testing.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• DNA extraction kit.
• Quantitative PCR (qPCR) machine.
• Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) platform.
• Sequencing reagents and consumables.
• PCR thermocycler.
• Laboratory Information System (LIS) for tracking and recording
results.
• Quality control materials.
1. PROCEDURE
4.1 DNA Extraction
1. Process the specimen using an appropriate DNA extraction kit
following the manufacturer's instructions.
2. Quantify the extracted DNA using spectrophotometry or
fluorometry to ensure concentration and purity.
3. Record DNA concentration and purity in the LIS.
4.2 Library Preparation
1. Prepare NGS libraries using extracted DNA following the library
preparation kit instructions.
2. Ensure that each sample is properly indexed to avoid cross-
contamination.
3. Perform a quality check of the libraries using qPCR or a
bioanalyzer to confirm the library size and concentration.
4.3 Sequencing
1. Pool the libraries and load them onto the NGS platform as
specified by the manufacturer.
2. Initiate the sequencing run ensuring all parameters are set
according to the validated protocol.
3. Monitor the sequencing run to ensure no interruptions occur.
4.4 Data Analysis
1. After the sequencing run is complete, store the raw data
securely and transfer it to the bioinformatics team for analysis.
2. Use validated bioinformatics pipelines to align the sequence
data to the human reference genome and call variants.
3. Perform variant annotation and prioritize variants based on their
potential clinical relevance.
4.5 Interpretation
1. The molecular geneticist reviews the annotated variants and
correlates them with clinical information.
2. Confirm pathogenic variants by an independent method if
necessary, such as Sanger sequencing.
4.6 Quality Control
1. Monitor positive and negative controls throughout the analytical
process to ensure accuracy.
2. Document all quality control results and ensure they meet
predetermined thresholds before reporting patient results.
3. REPORTING RESULTS
4. Compile a comprehensive report detailing identified variants,
their clinical relevance, and recommendations for further testing
or clinical follow-up if necessary.
5. Have the report reviewed and signed off by the supervising
molecular geneticist.
6. Transmit the finalized report to the clinician or healthcare
provider via the LIS.
7. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Pathogenic variants identified in the context of cerebrovascular
diseases will be reported based on established clinical guidelines
and literature.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• The NGS method may not detect all types of genetic alterations,
including large insertions, deletions, and complex structural
variants.
• Rare variants of unknown significance may require further
research and review.
1. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS
• Handle all biological specimens and chemicals in compliance with
standard biosafety procedures.
• Use personal protective equipment (PPE) at all times during the
laboratory procedures.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's instructions for DNA extraction kits, library
preparation kits, and sequencing platforms.
• Relevant clinical guidelines and literature for the interpretation of
cerebrovascular disease-related genetic variants.
By following this SOP, the laboratory ensures accurate and reliable
results for the Comprehensive Cerebrovascular Gene Panel,
contributing to the effective diagnosis and management of
cerebrovascular diseases.
