1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this protocol is to outline the analytical procedures
required to generate results for the Comprehensive Distal Weakness
Gene Panel. This gene panel is designed to detect genetic variations
that may contribute to distal muscle weakness. The protocol ensures
accuracy, reproducibility, and timely reporting of results.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing
and documenting all analytical procedures associated with the
assay.
• It is the responsibility of the laboratory supervisor and staff to
ensure that standard operating procedures are adhered to and
that results are validated and reported accurately.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/Acceptable Specimens:
• Peripheral blood collected in EDTA (purple top) tubes.
• Minimum volume required: 3 mL
• Specimens should be transported to the laboratory within 24
hours of collection and stored at 2-8°C until processing.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Any specimen type not listed above.
• Specimens arriving without appropriate collection date/time or
patient identification.
• Specimens that are severely hemolyzed, clotted, or contaminated.
3. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
Equipment:
• Automated DNA extraction system
• PCR thermal cycler
• Next-generation sequencing platform (e.g., Illumina, Ion Torrent)
• High-speed centrifuge
• Microplate reader
• Laboratory freezer and refrigerator
Reagents and Supplies:
• DNA extraction kits (validated for use with blood specimens)
• PCR reagents (primers, dNTPs, buffers, enzymes)
• Sequencing library preparation kits
• Sequencing reagents and consumables
• Calibration standards
• Positive and negative controls
4. PROCEDURE
A) DNA Extraction:
1. Verify patient information and specimen integrity.
2. Use an automated DNA extraction system to isolate DNA from
peripheral blood.
3. Quantify and assess the purity of the extracted DNA using a
microplate reader.
4. Store extracted DNA at -20°C until further processing.
B) PCR Amplification:
1. Design and optimize PCR primers specific to genes included in
the Distal Weakness Gene Panel.
2. Prepare the PCR reaction mix according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
3. Aliquot the PCR mix into reaction tubes, adding the DNA
template to each.
4. Perform PCR amplification using a thermal cycler (cycling
conditions will be gene-specific and optimized).
5. Validate the amplification success using gel electrophoresis.
C) Library Preparation and Sequencing:
1. Prepare sequencing libraries from amplified PCR products
using sequencing library preparation kits.
2. Validate library quality and quantity.
3. Load the sequencing libraries onto the next-generation
sequencing platform.
4. Run sequencing according to platform-specific protocols.
5. Monitor sequencing run and document any deviations.
D) Data Analysis:
1. Transfer raw sequencing data to the bioinformatics pipeline.
2. Perform primary data analysis, including alignment to reference
genome, variant calling, and annotation.
3. Generate a variant report with identified mutations and their
clinical significance.
4. Review and verify the variant report by a certified geneticist or
molecular biologist.
E) Quality Control:
1. Include positive and negative controls in each batch of testing
to monitor assay performance.
2. Validate new batches of reagents and sequencing kits prior to
use.
3. Document all quality control activities, including calibration
checks and control results.
4. Troubleshoot and corrective action for any quality control
failures.
5. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Results are reviewed and verified by the technologist/geneticist.
2. Generate the final report with the following sections: patient
information, specimen information, test results, interpretation of
results, and any recommendations.
3. Results are reported to the ordering physician or clinician
according to site-specific guidelines.
4. Critical findings (e.g., pathogenic mutations) are communicated
directly to the ordering physician along with any required follow-
up recommendations.
