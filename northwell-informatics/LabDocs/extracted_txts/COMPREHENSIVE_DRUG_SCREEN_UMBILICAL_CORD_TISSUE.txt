STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP) COMPREHENSIVE
DRUG SCREEN, UMBILICAL CORD TISSUE
1. PURPOSE To delineate the standard operating procedure for
the comprehensive drug screening of umbilical cord tissue
using laboratory techniques approved by our facility to ensure
reliable and reproducible results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY Qualified laboratory personnel are
responsible for the execution of this procedure, including the
documentation, analysis, and proper reporting of results. The
supervisor is responsible for overseeing the procedure and
ensuring quality control measures are adhered to.
3. DEFINITIONS Comprehensive Drug Screen: An analytical
method for the detection and identification of drugs and their
metabolites in biological specimens. Umbilical Cord Tissue: A
biological matrix collected from the umbilical cord, useful for
detecting in utero drug exposure.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Umbilical cord tissue.
• Specimen Collection: Collect at least a 6-inch segment of the
umbilical cord. Ensure no preservative is added to the specimen.
• Storage: Keep the collected umbilical cord tissue refrigerated at
2-8°C until it's ready for processing.
• Transport: Transport refrigerated samples to the laboratory as
soon as possible.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Equipment:
◦ Homogenizer
◦ Centrifuge
◦ Mass spectrometer (e.g., LC-MS/MS)
◦ Vortex mixer
◦ Pipettes and pipette tips
• Reagents:
◦ Methanol
◦ Acetonitrile
◦ Water (HPLC grade)
◦ Internal standards specific to each drug class
• Supplies:
◦ 15 mL conical tubes
◦ 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes
◦ Disposable gloves
◦ Laboratory glassware
1. PROCEDURE A. Pre-analytical Phase:
2. Ensure that specimens are properly labeled and have complete
requisition forms with relevant clinical information.
3. Verify that the specimen meets the acceptance criteria.
4. Document specimen receipt in the laboratory information
system (LIS).
B. Sample Preparation:
1. Rinse the umbilical cord tissue with saline solution to remove
any blood or external contaminants.
2. Homogenize the tissue by cutting it into small pieces and
placing it into a 15 mL conical tube.
3. Add 2 mL of methanol to the tube and homogenize using the
homogenizer.
4. Centrifuge the homogenate at 4000 rpm for 10 minutes.
5. Transfer the supernatant to a new 15 mL conical tube.
C. Extraction:
1. Vortex the supernatant for 2 minutes.
2. Add an internal standard solution to the supernatant to ensure
the precision and accuracy of the drug screen.
3. Use a liquid-liquid extraction method with acetonitrile and water
to extract the drug components.
4. Vortex the mixture and centrifuge at 4000 rpm for 10 minutes.
5. Collect the upper organic layer into a clean 1.5 mL
microcentrifuge tube.
D. Analysis:
1. Using the mass spectrometer, inject 5 µL of the extracted
sample into the system.
2. Run the comprehensive drug screen analysis according to the
manufacturer’s protocols for the LC-MS/MS.
3. Verify and document the system suitability and calibration.
E. Data Interpretation:
1. Analyze the chromatograms and ion spectra derived from LC-
MS/MS to identify the presence of drugs and their metabolites.
2. Compare results with quality control standards to ensure
accuracy.
3. Document any observed deviations from the norms and notify
the supervisor as needed.
F. Reporting Results:
1. Confirm all positive results with a secondary method, where
applicable.
2. Document findings in the LIS.
3. Review and verify results before releasing them for clinical
interpretation.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include at least one negative and one positive control sample with
each batch of specimens tested.
• Follow instrument-specific QC procedures, including routine
maintenance and calibration.
• Document all QC activities, internal control results, and any
corrective actions taken.
1. SAFETY AND COMPLIANCE
• Adhere to all relevant safety guidelines and biosafety protocols
when handling biological specimens.
• Use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) such as
gloves, lab coats, and goggles.
• Dispose of all biological waste and chemicals following proper
biohazard disposal procedures.
