STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE
Title: Analytical Phase for Generating Results for Comprehensive
Epilepsy with or without Encephalopathy Gene Panel
1. PURPOSE
To establish a standardized procedure for the analysis and
interpretation of the Comprehensive Epilepsy with or without
Encephalopathy Gene Panel in order to ensure reliable, accurate,
and timely test results.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel involved in the
analysis of the Comprehensive Epilepsy with or without
Encephalopathy Gene Panel.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
All laboratory personnel performing analysis are responsible for
adhering to this protocol. It is the responsibility of the laboratory
supervisor to ensure that all personnel are trained, the procedure is
followed correctly, and any deviations are documented and
addressed.
4. DEFINITIONS
• Comprehensive Epilepsy with or without Encephalopathy Gene
Panel: A genetic test that identifies mutations in specific genes
associated with epilepsy and encephalopathy to assist in
diagnosis, prognosis, and management.
5. REQUIRED MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT
• DNA Extraction Kit (validated for blood, saliva, or tissue
specimens)
• Library Preparation Kit specific for the gene panel
• Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) platform (e.g., Illumina, Ion
Torrent)
• Bioinformatics analysis software
• Reference genome data
• Quality control materials
• Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS)
• Gel electrophoresis apparatus
• Reagents for PCR and quantification
• Computer with internet access and required software for data
analysis
6. PROCEDURE
A) DNA Extraction and Quantification:
1. Validate and utilize the appropriate DNA extraction kit based on
the type of specimen received.
2. Measure DNA concentration and quality using a
spectrophotometer or fluorometer.
3. Record extraction details in LIMS.
B) Library Preparation:
1. Perform library preparation for sequencing as per the
manufacturer's protocol for the specific gene panel.
2. Quantify and assess the quality of the library using appropriate
methods (e.g., qPCR, bioanalyzer).
3. Normalize the DNA libraries to the required concentration.
C) Sequencing:
1. Load the prepared and normalized libraries onto the sequencer
as per the sequencing platform's instructions.
2. Program the sequencer for the run, inputting the gene panel
specifications and run parameters.
3. Monitor the sequencing run, ensuring data integrity and prompt
intervention if instrument errors occur.
D) Data Analysis:
1. Import the raw sequencing data into the bioinformatics analysis
software.
2. Align the reads to the reference genome to identify variants.
3. Filter and annotate variants based on criteria such as read
depth, quality score, and clinical relevance.
4. Use appropriate databases and literature to predict the
pathogenicity of identified variants.
E) Interpretation and Reporting:
1. Review the filtered and annotated variant list.
2. Interpret the clinical significance of the variants based on
established guidelines (e.g., ACMG).
3. Prepare a comprehensive report detailing the findings, including
identified pathogenic, likely pathogenic, variants of uncertain
significance, benign, and likely benign variants.
4. Review and sign off the report by a qualified geneticist or
pathologist.
F) Quality Control:
1. Include positive and negative control samples in each run.
2. Document quality metrics and ensure they meet the established
acceptance criteria.
3. Troubleshoot and address any quality control failures before
proceeding with analysis.
G) Documentation:
1. Ensure all steps, from specimen reception through reporting,
are documented in the LIMS.
2. Archive all raw data, analysis files, and reports according to
laboratory guidelines.
7. LIMITATIONS
• This protocol is limited to the detection of genetic variants
included in the specific gene panel and may not detect all
mutations associated with epilepsy or encephalopathy.
• Variants in regions with low coverage or high GC content may
require confirmation by an alternative method.
