Standard Operating Procedure
COMPREHENSIVE MARFAN, LOEYS-DIETZ, EHLERS-DANLOS,
AND AORTOPATHY GENE PANEL, VARIES
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedures involved in the analytical phase of
generating results for Comprehensive Marfan, Loeys-Dietz, Ehlers-
Danlos, and Aortopathy Gene Panel testing.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for ensuring that the
procedures outlined below are performed accurately and consistently.
All staff should notify supervisors of any deficiencies that could affect
test results.
3. DEFINITIONS
Genomic DNA Extraction: The process by which DNA is isolated from
a patient’s specimen for testing. Next Generation Sequencing (NGS):
High-throughput sequencing technology used for comprehensive
examination of the gene panel. Bioinformatics Analysis:
Computational analysis of sequencing data to identify genetic
variants. Quality Control (QC): Procedures integrated into the testing
process to ensure the accuracy and reliability of results.
4. PROCEDURE
A) Genomic DNA Extraction
1. Required Equipment and Reagents:
◦ Automated DNA extractor
◦ DNA extraction kits (validated and quality checked)
◦ Specimen tubes with patient samples
2. Procedure:
◦ Ensure specimen tubes are properly labeled and match
patient information.
◦ Load specimen tubes into automated DNA extractor.
◦ Follow the manufacturer's protocol for DNA extraction.
◦ Quantify and assess the quality of extracted DNA using a
spectrophotometer or equivalent.
B) Library Preparation and NGS Workflow
1. Required Equipment and Reagents:
◦ Library preparation kits (compatible with NGS platform)
◦ NGS sequencing machine (e.g., Illumina)
◦ Reagent cartridges for sequencing
2. Procedure:
◦ Prepare DNA libraries using the library preparation kit
according to the manufacturer's instructions.
◦ Verify library quality using a bioanalyzer to ensure
appropriate fragment sizes.
◦ Load libraries into the NGS sequencing machine.
◦ Perform sequencing according to the NGS platform
instructions.
C) Bioinformatics Analysis
1. Required Equipment and Software:
◦ High-performance computational server
◦ Bioinformatics software pipeline for sequence alignment and
variant calling (validated)
2. Procedure:
◦ Transfer raw sequencing data to computational server.
◦ Utilize bioinformatics software to perform sequence
alignment against the reference genome.
◦ Call variants through the computational pipeline.
◦ Filter and annotate variants relevant to Marfan, Loeys-Dietz,
Ehlers-Danlos, and Aortopathy syndromes.
D) Interpretation and Reporting of Results
1. Required Documentation:
◦ Patient report format
◦ Reference database for genetic variants associated with
Marfan, Loeys-Dietz, Ehlers-Danlos, and Aortopathy
syndromes
2. Procedure:
◦ Review and interpret filtered variants using established
criteria for pathogenicity.
◦ Cross-reference genetic variants with the clinical database.
◦ Generate a detailed report including identified variants, their
clinical significance, and potential impact on patient health.
◦ Validate the report with a senior clinical geneticist.
◦ Ensure the report is accurately entered into the Laboratory
Information System (LIS) for physician access.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Materials:
◦ Positive and Negative control DNA samples
◦ Internal controls integrated into library preparation and
sequencing kits
2. Procedure:
◦ Include control samples in each batch of testing to monitor
performance.
◦ Monitor NGS run metrics for any deviations from standard
performance parameters.
◦ Perform repeat testing and cross-validation with control
samples if discrepancy in results is detected.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Method: Results are automatically transmitted to the LIS and
must be reviewed and verified by the technologist who ensures
accuracy.
2. Integrity Check: Verify sample integrity before reporting.
Address any identified issues appropriately and include notes
for clarity.
7. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s protocol for DNA extraction and library preparation
kits.
• NGS platform instructions.
• Internal bioinformatics pipeline documentation.

Danlos, and Aortopathy genetic variants.
8. DOCUMENTATION
The completion of all steps must be documented thoroughly in the
laboratory records, including any corrective actions taken if quality
control parameters are not met.
End of Procedure
This SOP ensures that all staff members utilize a standardized
approach to generating accurate, reliable, and clinically useful results
for patients undergoing genetic testing for connective tissue
disorders, aortopathy, and related syndromes.
