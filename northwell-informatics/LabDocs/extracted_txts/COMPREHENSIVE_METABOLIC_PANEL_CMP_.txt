Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Comprehensive
Metabolic Panel (CMP)
1. PURPOSE
The Comprehensive Metabolic Panel (CMP) is a set of 14 blood tests
that give important information about the body's metabolism. These
tests measure glucose levels, electrolyte and fluid balance, kidney
function, and liver function. This SOP aims to outline the protocol for
performing CMP to ensure accurate and reliable results.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Serum or plasma
• Preferred Collection Container: Lithium heparin (light green or
PST) or plain red stopper tubes.
• Volume Required: Minimum of 3 mL
• Transport Conditions: Rapid transport to the laboratory;
refrigerate if there is a delay.
• Unacceptable Specimens: Hemolyzed specimens, specimens
with significant clotting, specimens older than 6 hours without
refrigeration, or specimens collected in expired vacutainers.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Analyzers: Roche Cobas c702 or equivalent automated
chemistry analyzer
• Reagents: Roche reagent packs for CMP tests
• Supplies: Pipette tips, calibrated pipettes, centrifuge, serum
separator tubes (SST)
1. PROCEDURE
A) Sample Preparation
1. Centrifuge the blood sample at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes.
2. Separate the serum/plasma from the clot using sterile pipettes
and transfer to labeled sample cups.
3. Ensure serum/plasma is free of hemolysis and particulates.
B) Analyzer Setup
1. Confirm the proper calibration and quality control procedures
have been performed on the analyzer.
2. Load reagents according to manufacturer instructions.
3. Ensure that the QC results are within acceptable limits before
proceeding with patient samples.
C) Testing Procedure
1. Load the prepared sample cups into the analyzer.
2. Select the CMP test panel on the analyzer’s user interface.
3. Initiate the analysis. The analyzer will perform the following
tests:
◦ Glucose
◦ Calcium
◦ Sodium
◦ Potassium
◦ CO2 (Bicarbonate)
◦ Chloride
◦ Albumin
◦ Total Protein
◦ Bilirubin (Total)
◦ ALP (Alkaline Phosphatase)
◦ AST (Aspartate Aminotransferase)
◦ ALT (Alanine Aminotransferase)
◦ BUN (Blood Urea Nitrogen)
◦ Creatinine
4. Monitor the analyzer for any error messages or flags which may
indicate the need for repeat testing or troubleshooting.
D) Review and Verification
1. Review the results generated by the analyzer for accuracy and
completeness.
2. Verify any flagged results by performing repeat analysis if
necessary.
3. Check results for potential interferences or anomalies based on
standard thresholds and clinical guidelines.
QUALITY CONTROL
1. QC Material: Utilize commercially available multi-level QC
material (e.g., Biorad Liquichek).
2. Perform QC each day the tests are performed and record
results.
3. QC results must fall within the acceptable range before patient
results can be reported.
4. Troubleshoot any QC failures according to established
laboratory protocols.
REPORTING RESULTS
1. Results are automatically transmitted to the Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
2. The technologist must review and verify the results in the LIS
before releasing the report.
3. Enter any comments regarding sample integrity or quality
control issues if necessary.
