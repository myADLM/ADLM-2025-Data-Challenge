Comprehensive Metabolic Panel plus Glucose (CMP plus
Glucose) Protocol
1. PURPOSE To provide a standardized procedure for the
analysis and reporting of Comprehensive Metabolic Panel plus
Glucose (CMP plus Glucose) results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the medical laboratory staff to perform
and document the analytical procedures according to this
protocol. Supervisors are responsible for ensuring staff
adherence to the protocol and addressing any deviations or
issues that may arise during the analysis.
3. SPECIMEN
◦ Preferred/Acceptable: Serum or plasma specimens.
Collect a minimum of 2 mL of blood in a serum separator
tube (SST) or a plasma separator tube (PST).
◦ Unacceptable: Hemolyzed, lipemic, or grossly icteric
specimens. Specimens not properly labeled or shipped.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
◦ Automated Clinical Chemistry Analyzer.
◦ Specific reagents and calibrators for CMP plus Glucose
testing.
◦ Quality control materials: three levels (high, normal, low).
◦ Disposable pipettes/calibrated pipettes.
◦ Centrifuge.
5. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation 1. Verify that all reagents, calibrators, and
controls are within their expiration date. 2. Perform a daily
equipment performance check and ensure the analyzer is
properly calibrated. 3. Run quality controls (QC) for all analytes.
Verify that QC results are within acceptable limits before
proceeding with patient samples.
B. Specimen Handling 1. Centrifuge specimens at 3,000 RPM
for 10 minutes to obtain serum or plasma. 2. Inspect serum/
plasma for hemolysis, lipemia, and icterus. Document any
specimens deemed unacceptable.
C. Analysis 1. Load specimens onto the automated analyzer,
following the manufacturer’s specifications. 2. Enter patient
identification and test orders into the analyzer system. 3. The
automated analyzer will perform tests for the following
components: - Glucose - Calcium - Albumin - Total Protein -
Sodium - Potassium - Chloride - Carbon Dioxide (CO2) - Blood
Urea Nitrogen (BUN) - Creatinine - Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP)
- Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) - Aspartate Aminotransferase
(AST) - Total Bilirubin
D. Result Review and Verification 1. Verify that the analytes'
results fall within the acceptable reference intervals. 2. Check
for any flags or error messages provided by the analyzer.
Repeat analysis on flagged specimens using the same or
alternative method. 3. Document any deviations and steps
taken to rectify issues.
E. Result Reporting 1. Ensure completion of all testing
parameters before verifying results. 2. Review and release
results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS) once they
meet the QC criteria. 3. Document critical results and notify the
appropriate healthcare provider.
6. REFERENCE INTERVALS
◦ Glucose: 70-99 mg/dL
◦ Calcium: 8.5-10.2 mg/dL
◦ Albumin: 3.4-5.4 g/dL
◦ Total Protein: 6.0-8.3 g/dL
◦ Sodium: 135-145 mmol/L
◦ Potassium: 3.5-5.1 mmol/L
◦ Chloride: 98-106 mmol/L
◦ CO2: 23-29 mmol/L
◦ BUN: 6-20 mg/dL
◦ Creatinine: 0.7-1.3 mg/dL (men), 0.6-1.1 mg/dL (women)
◦ ALP: 44-147 IU/L
◦ ALT: 7-56 IU/L
◦ AST: 10-40 IU/L
◦ Total Bilirubin: 0.2-1.2 mg/dL
7. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Run quality control samples at the beginning of each shift,
after system maintenance, and before running patient tests.
◦ Document all QC results and take corrective action for any
outliers. Ensure QC samples cover the complete
measurement range.
8. TROUBLESHOOTING
◦ If QC results are out of range, recalibrate the analyzer, run
maintenance procedures, and/or troubleshoot according to
the manufacturer's guidelines.
◦ Repeat testing of the patient samples if any analyte is
flagged by the analyzer or if QC fails.
◦ Document corrective actions taken.
9. REFERENCES
◦ Manufacturer’s Instructions and Operator’s Manuals for the
Clinical Chemistry Analyzer and all testing reagents used.
◦ Regulatory Guidelines and Standards from CLIA (Clinical
Laboratory Improvement Amendments).
10. SAFETY AND WASTE DISPOSAL
◦ Follow all safety guidelines for handling biological
specimens.
◦ Discard unused specimens, reagents, and disposable
materials according to biohazard waste disposal protocols.
Following this protocol will ensure the accurate and reliable analysis
of the Comprehensive Metabolic Panel plus Glucose (CMP plus
Glucose) and contribute to the quality patient care.
