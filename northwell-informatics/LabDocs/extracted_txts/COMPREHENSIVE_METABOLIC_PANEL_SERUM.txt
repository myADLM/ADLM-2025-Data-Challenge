Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Comprehensive
Metabolic Panel (CMP), Serum Analysis
1. PURPOSE
To provide guidelines for the analytical phase of the Comprehensive
Metabolic Panel (CMP), Serum, including sample preparation,
equipment handling, testing procedure, quality control, and result
reporting.
Responsibility:
• Designated staff are responsible for performing the CMP analysis
according to this SOP.
• Supervisors ensure that the procedure is followed correctly and
any issues are promptly addressed.
2. DEFINITION
A CMP is a series of blood tests that provide information about the
body's chemical balance and metabolism. The CMP includes tests for
glucose, calcium, proteins, electrolytes, and liver and kidney function
markers.
3. PROCEDURE
3.1. Sample Collection and Preparation
• Specimen: Serum
• Preferred Collection Tube: Serum Separator Tube (SST), gold or
red top.
• Volume: Minimum of 3 mL serum.
• Specimen Stability:
◦ Room temperature: 8 hours
◦ Refrigerated (2-8°C): 48 hours
◦ Frozen (-20°C): 1 month
3.2. Equipment and Reagents
• Analyzer: Use an automated chemistry analyzer (e.g., Roche
Cobas, Beckman Coulter AU)
• Calibrators: As specified by the manufacturer.
• Controls: Two levels (normal and pathologic).
• Reagents: Specific to each analyte; provided with manufacturer
instructions.
3.3. Detailed Testing Procedure
1. Calibrate the Analyzer:
◦ Follow the manufacturer’s protocol for calibration before
testing.
◦ Document calibration date, time, and results.
2. Quality Control:
◦ Run two levels of quality control (QC) material: normal and
pathologic.
◦ Document QC results and verify that they are within
established ranges.
3. Sample Handling:
◦ Centrifuge SST tubes for 10 minutes at 3000 rpm to
separate the serum.
◦ Transfer serum to a clean, labelled aliquot tube.
◦ Ensure no hemolysis, lipemia, or icterus which may affect
results.
4. Analyte Testing:
◦ Load the prepared serum samples into the automated
chemistry analyzer.
◦ Initiate the testing protocol as per manufacturer’s
instructions, ensuring proper identification of each sample.
◦ Tests included in CMP:
▪ Glucose
▪ Calcium
▪ Albumin
▪ Total Protein
▪ Sodium
▪ Potassium
▪ CO2 (Bicarbonate)
▪ Chloride
▪ Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN)
▪ Creatinine
▪ Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP)
▪ Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT)
▪ Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST)
▪ Total Bilirubin
5. Result Validation:
◦ Review and verify all test results.
◦ Ensure QC results are within acceptable limits before
validating patient results.
◦ Investigate and rerun any out-of-range results or flagged
results.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform QC with every batch of samples or after major instrument
maintenance.
• Document all QC results and take corrective actions if controls
are out of range.
• Instruments are periodically checked and maintained as per
manufacturer guidelines to ensure they are functioning correctly.
5. RESULTS REPORTING
• Results are automatically transmitted to the Laboratory
Information System (LIS) and reviewed by the technologist.
• Critical values must be flagged and immediately communicated to
the physician as per laboratory protocol.
• Final results must be reviewed and verified before reporting.
6. SAMPLE INTEGRITY
• Reject any samples exhibiting hemolysis, significant lipemia, or
icterus unless necessary interference checks indicate acceptable
accuracy.
• Document all instances of sample rejection and the reason for
rejection.
7. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Follow laboratory-specific reference intervals for each analyte in the
CMP panel. Document any deviations from established ranges.
8. DOCUMENTATION AND RECORD KEEPING
• Maintain detailed logs of all quality control, calibration, and
sample testing procedures.
• Retain records as per regulatory requirements for traceability and
quality assurance.
9. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s operation manual for the automated chemistry
analyzer.
• Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines.
• Relevant laboratory-specific protocols and guidelines.
10. REVIEW AND REVISION
This SOP will be reviewed annually or as required to ensure it meets
current standards and practices. Any revisions will be documented
and communicated to all relevant personnel.
