Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Comprehensive
Nephrology Gene Panel, Varies
1. PURPOSE
This SOP details the analytical phase procedures for generating
results for the Comprehensive Nephrology Gene Panel testing. The
objective is to ensure accuracy, reliability, and consistency in the
testing and reporting process.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of designated laboratory personnel to perform
and document all procedures as described herein. It is also the
responsibility of all staff to report any issues or non-conformities to
the supervisor.
2. DEFINITIONS
Comprehensive Nephrology Gene Panel: A genomic test designed to
analyze multiple genes associated with hereditary nephrological
disorders.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred Specimen Type: Whole blood in EDTA (lavender top)
tube or alternatively saliva sample collected using a DNA
stabilization kit.
• Specimen Volume: At least 4 mL of whole blood or sufficient
saliva to meet the requirements of the DNA stabilization kit
manufacturer.
• Specimen Stability: Whole blood samples must be stored at
2-8°C and processed within 72 hours of collection. Saliva samples
should be stored as per the DNA stabilization kit instructions.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• DNA extraction kits
• PCR amplification reagents
• Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) platform
• Bioinformatics tools for variant analysis
• Quality control materials
5. PROCEDURE
A. DNA Extraction:
1. Sample Verification and Logging:
◦ Verify the sample labeling and accompanying
documentation.
◦ Log the sample into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
2. DNA Extraction:
◦ Follow the DNA extraction protocol specific to the extraction
kit being used (e.g., Qiagen DNA Mini Kit).
◦ Record the concentration and purity of the extracted DNA
using a spectrophotometer.
3. Documentation:
◦ Document the extracted DNA volume and quality control
(QC) results in the DNA Extraction Log.
B. Library Preparation and Sequencing:
1. Library Preparation:
◦ Use the appropriate reagent kits for library preparation (e.g.,
Illumina TruSeq DNA Library Prep Kit).
◦ Follow the standard protocol, including fragmentation, end-
repair, adapter ligation, and amplification.
◦ Perform QC using a bioanalyzer to verify library size
distribution and concentration.
2. Sequencing:
◦ Load the prepared library onto the NGS platform following
the manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Use appropriate run parameters as per the Comprehensive
Nephrology Gene Panel requirements.
◦ Document run information in the Sequencing Log.
C. Data Analysis:
1. Primary Analysis:
◦ Perform base calling and demultiplexing using the NGS
platform’s software.
◦ Ensure data integrity and completeness.
2. Secondary Analysis:
◦ Use bioinformatics tools to align sequences to the reference
genome and perform variant calling.
◦ Filter and annotate variants to identify potential pathogenic
mutations related to nephrological disorders.
◦ Document all analysis steps and software versions in the
Bioinformatics Analysis Log.
3. Tertiary Analysis:
◦ Review annotated results and cross-reference with clinical
databases.
◦ Perform a manual review of significant variants and interpret
their clinical relevance.
◦ Document all findings in the Result Interpretation Log.
D. Quality Control:
• Perform QC at each stage, including DNA extraction, library
preparation, sequencing, and data analysis.
• Utilize internal controls and reference samples to ensure assay
performance.
• Document and review QC results to confirm assay validity before
proceeding to result generation.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Review and Verification:
◦ The final interpreted results must be reviewed and verified
by a certified laboratory scientist.
◦ Ensure all associated raw data and QC logs are complete
and meet the laboratory’s standards.
2. Report Generation:
◦ Generate a comprehensive report including patient
identification, methodology, identified variants, clinical
interpretation, and any recommendations.
◦ Reports should be drafted using the standard laboratory
reporting format and reviewed by the laboratory director or
designee before release.
3. Documentation:
◦ Ensure all steps, findings, and communications related to
the test are documented within the LIS.
◦ Archive raw data, analysis logs, and final reports according
to laboratory data retention policies.
