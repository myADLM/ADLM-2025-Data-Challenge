Comprehensive Neuromuscular Gene Panel Protocol
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this protocol is to outline the
analytical phase for generating results for the Comprehensive
Neuromuscular Gene Panel, ensuring accurate and reliable
detection of relevant genetic variants.
2. SPECIMEN
◦ Sample Type: Peripheral blood in EDTA tubes (lavender top)
or buccal swab.
◦ Specimen Stability: Samples should be kept refrigerated
and must be processed within 7 days of collection.
◦ Volume: Minimum 3-5 mL of peripheral blood or sufficient
DNA yield from buccal swab.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
◦ Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) instrument (Illumina or
equivalent)
◦ DNA Extraction Kit (Qiagen or equivalent)
◦ Library Preparation Kit (Agilent SureSelect or equivalent)
◦ PCR and qPCR reagents
◦ Thermal Cycler
◦ Automated Liquid Handling System
◦ High Sensitivity DNA Reagents for Quantification
(Bioanalyzer or equivalent)
4. PROCEDURE
A. DNA Extraction
1. Use an appropriate DNA extraction kit to isolate genomic
DNA from the peripheral blood or buccal swab sample.
2. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for extraction,
ensuring high quality and integrity of the DNA.
3. Quantify DNA using a fluorometer or spectrophotometer
and record concentration and purity (e.g., A260/A280
ratio).
B. Library Preparation
1. Utilize the library preparation kit according to the
manufacturer's protocol to prepare the DNA library for
sequencing.
2. Perform end repair, A-tailing, adapter ligation, and PCR
amplification steps.
3. Validate and quantify the prepared library using a
bioanalyzer or qPCR.
C. Sequencing
1. Load the prepared library onto the NGS instrument
following the manufacturer's instructions.
2. Perform sequencing run optimized for comprehensive
gene panel analysis ensuring sufficient depth of coverage.
3. Monitor the sequencing process and documented
instrument performance, yield, and quality metrics.
D. Data Analysis
1. Use appropriate bioinformatics pipeline for sequence
alignment, variant calling, and annotation.
2. Employ tools to filter and prioritize variants based on
clinical significance and pathogenicity (e.g., using
databases such as ClinVar, OMIM).
3. Perform secondary validation via Sanger sequencing for
critical variants, if required.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Include positive and negative control samples in each
extraction and sequencing run.
◦ Utilize internal controls within the library prep and
sequencing to monitor performance.
◦ Perform routine calibration and maintenance of equipment
as per manufacturer guidelines.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ Compile and interpret the generated data focusing on
clinically relevant variants.
◦ Document variants with clinical implications, coverage
details, and quality metrics.
◦ Review variant classifications and significance through
multi-disciplinary discussions, ensuring accurate
interpretation and confirmation.
◦ Generate a comprehensive report including detailed
findings, recommendations, and references.
7. REFERENCES
◦ Latest manufacturers' instructions for DNA extraction and
library preparation kits.
◦ Standard bioinformatics and variant interpretation guidelines
such as those from ACMG (American College of Medical
Genetics and Genomics).
◦ Relevant literature and clinical databases for variant
annotation and classification.
NOTE: This protocol must be adhered to strictly to ensure the
delivery of reliable, accurate, and clinically actionable genetic results
for neuromuscular disorders. Regular updates are essential to keep
up with advancements in technology and best practices as per CLIA
regulations and guidelines.
