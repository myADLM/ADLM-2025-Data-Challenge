Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Comprehensive Peripheral Neuropathy Gene Panel
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to delineate the protocol and procedures
for generating results from the Comprehensive Peripheral
Neuropathy Gene Panel in a CLIA-certified laboratory setting. This
procedure ensures accurate and reliable results for genetic testing
aimed at diagnosing hereditary peripheral neuropathies.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
Laboratory personnel, including clinical laboratory scientists and
genetic technologists, are responsible for adhering to this SOP to
ensure all aspects of the analysis are performed accurately and
consistently. Supervisors are to ensure compliance and address any
procedural issues.
3. DEFINITIONS
• Gene Panel: A collection of genes analyzed collectively to identify
variations associated with peripheral neuropathy.
• Workflow: Sequence of steps from specimen processing to result
generation.
• NGS: Next Generation Sequencing, a method used for
sequencing DNA to detect genetic variants.
4. PROCEDURE
A) Pre-Analysis Preparation
1. Reagent Preparation:
◦ Ensure all reagents required for DNA extraction, library
preparation, sequencing, and data analysis are available
and within expiration date.
2. Equipment Setup:
◦ Validate all equipment involved in sequencing (e.g.,
sequencers, thermal cyclers, centrifuges) daily prior to
operation.
◦ Calibration certificates and maintenance logs should be up
to date.
3. Sample Quality Check:
◦ Verify that the sample obtained is of adequate volume and
quality (appropriate collection tube, no contamination,
correct patient identifiers).
◦ Store extracted DNA at -20°C until ready for analysis.
B) DNA Extraction and Quality Control
1. Extraction:
◦ Use validated DNA extraction protocols suitable for blood or
tissue samples depending on the specimen.
◦ Ensure pure and sufficient quantity of DNA is extracted.
2. Quality Control:
◦ Assess quantity and quality of DNA using
spectrophotometric measurements (e.g., A260/280 ratio)
and agarose gel electrophoresis.
◦ Samples should meet minimum concentration and purity
requirements to proceed (e.g., A260/280 ratio between
1.8-2.0).
C) Library Preparation
1. Target Enrichment:
◦ Use capture probes or amplicon-based approaches to
selectively enrich target regions, adhering strictly to
manufacturer’s protocol specific to the gene panel.
2. Quality Control:
◦ Quantify enriched libraries using fluorometric methods (e.g.,
Qubit) and assess size distribution using capillary
electrophoresis (e.g., Bioanalyzer).
D) Sequencing
1. Setup:
◦ Load prepared libraries onto sequencing platform according
to manufacturer's guidelines (e.g., Illumina, Ion Torrent).
◦ Verify sequencing parameters set to capture required
coverage for diagnostic accuracy.
2. Monitoring:
◦ Continuously monitor sequencing run for error rates and
data quality.
◦ Archive raw sequencing data securely.
E) Data Analysis
1. Primary Analysis:
◦ Perform base calling and sequence alignment to reference
genome using vendor-provided software and pipelines.
◦ Ensure alignment metrics meet quality benchmarks (e.g.,
≥99% mapped reads).
2. Variant Calling:
◦ Use validated bioinformatics tools to identify genetic variants
(SNPs, indels, etc.).
◦ Cross-check identified variants against population
databases and known pathogenic databases (e.g., ClinVar).
F) Interpretation and Reporting
1. Variant Annotation:
◦ Annotate genetic variants using appropriate functional
annotation tools to identify potential pathogenicity.
◦ Categorize variants according to ACMG guidelines.
2. Clinical Correlation:
◦ Correlate genetic findings with clinical information provided
and known disease associations.
◦ Prepare a comprehensive report detailing identified variants,
clinical relevance, and recommendations for follow-up.
3. Quality Assurance:
◦ Perform internal quality checks by comparing results of
known control samples included in the run.
◦ Ensure detailed review of results by senior laboratory
personnel before release.
G) Documentation and Record Keeping
1. Logging and Tracking:
◦ Maintain detailed logs of sample processing, reagent
batches, equipment validation, and sequencing runs.
◦ Ensure all data storage, access, and retrieval are compliant
with regulatory standards.
2. Reporting Results:
◦ Upload finalized reports to the Laboratory Information
System (LIS) and notify requesting physician.
◦ Follow local guidelines for result verification, interpretation
notes, and communication of critical findings.
