Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH)
Pediatric Profile 6, Comprehensive Screen
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to ensure standardized, reliable, and
accurate procedures are followed in the laboratory analysis of
specimens for the Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH) Pediatric
Profile 6, Comprehensive Screen.
Responsibility: Designated staff are responsible for performing tests
and documenting results as defined in this procedure. It is the
responsibility of all staff to report any deviations or unexpected
observations to a supervisor.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
2.1. Acceptable Samples:
• Blood collected in a pediatric SST (Serum Separator Tube) or
heparinized vacutainer (green top).
• Minimum volume: 1 mL of serum.
2.2. Unacceptable Samples:
• Specimens collected in EDTA, citrate, or oxalate tubes.
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
• Insufficient volume or clotted specimens.
1. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• Pediatric SST
• Heparinized vacutainer (green top)
• CAH Pediatric Profile 6 assay kits
• Standard controls and calibrators
• Micropipettes and tips
• Centrifuge
• Incubator
• Vortex mixer
• Plate reader or automated analyzer
1. PROCEDURE
4.1. Pre-Analytical Procedures:
• Inspect the specimen for integrity and acceptability.
• Store specimens at 2-8°C until processing.
• Ensure all equipment has been properly maintained and
calibrated.
4.2. Analytical Procedures: 4.2.1. Specimen Preparation
• Allow serum specimens to reach room temperature.
• Gently mix specimens by inverting the tube before aliquoting.
• Centrifuge the sample at 3000 RPM for 10 minutes to separate
serum if required.
4.2.2. Test Setup:
• Follow the CAH Pediatric Profile 6 assay kit insert for detailed
reagent preparation.
• Prepare standard controls and calibrators according to kit
instructions.
• Load controls, calibrators, and patient specimens into the
designated wells of the assay plate.
4.2.3. Assay Procedure:
• Pipette the appropriate volume of each reagent into the wells as
per manufacturer's protocol.
• Incubate the plate at room temperature or as specified in the
protocol for the indicated time.
• Measure optical density (OD) using the plate reader at the
appropriate wavelength.
4.2.4. Calculation:
• Calculate concentrations from the standard curve generated by
the calibrators.
• Ensure results fall within the established linearity range of the
test.
• Apply any necessary dilution factors in final calculations.
4.3. Post-Analytical Procedures:
• Review and verify all results for accuracy.
• Record results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Ensure all data entry is double-checked for correctness.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
5.1. Internal Quality Controls:
• Run at least two quality controls (low and high) with each batch of
patient specimens.
• Document control results and ensure they fall within established
ranges.
• Any out-of-range QC results necessitate investigation and
potential repeat testing.
5.2. External Quality Controls:
• Participate in external proficiency testing quarterly.
• Review external QC results for accuracy and take corrective
action if necessary.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results are reviewed and verified by the technologist before entry
into the LIS.
• Results exceeding critical limits must be immediately
communicated to the responsible clinician.
• Repeat any test values that are unusual or inconsistent with
clinical history before reporting.
1. MAINTENANCE AND CALIBRATION
• Follow manufacturer instructions for routine calibration and
maintenance of the assay equipment.
• Document all calibrations and maintenance activities in the
appropriate logs.
1. REFERENCES
• CAH Pediatric Profile 6 assay kit insert.
• Laboratory Information System (LIS) guidelines.
• Established laboratory quality control manuals.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If the control values are out of range, inspect reagents and
equipment for issues.
• Repeat the test if there are deviations in standard or control
values.
• Contact the technical support of the assay manufacturer for
unresolved issues.
This SOP aims to ensure the highest quality and reliability in
generating results for the Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH)
Pediatric Profile 6, Comprehensive Screen. Compliance with this
protocol safeguards the integrity and accuracy of the laboratory's
data.
