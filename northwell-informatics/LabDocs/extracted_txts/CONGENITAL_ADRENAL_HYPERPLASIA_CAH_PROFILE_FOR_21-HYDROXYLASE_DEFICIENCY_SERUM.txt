Standard Operating Procedure Title: Analytical Phase of Generating
Results for Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH) Profile for 21-
Hydroxylase Deficiency, Serum
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedures for the analytical phase of generating
accurate and timely results for the Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia
(CAH) profile, specifically for 21-Hydroxylase Deficiency, using serum
samples.
1. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all staff members involved in the analytical
phase of testing, including laboratory technologists, laboratory
supervisors, and quality control personnel.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the laboratory technologist to perform the
testing according to the procedure outlined in this SOP. The
laboratory supervisor is responsible for ensuring compliance with the
SOP and addressing any issues that arise during the testing process.
Quality control personnel are responsible for monitoring and
documenting quality control measures.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen Type: Serum Preferred Collection Container: SST (Serum
Separation Tube) Minimum Volume: 0.5 mL of serum Stability: Serum
samples are stable for up to 24 hours at room temperature and up to
7 days when refrigerated (2-8°C). For long-term storage, samples
should be frozen at -20°C or lower.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Centrifuge
• Refrigerated storage units
• Freezers (-20°C or lower)
• Pipettes and tips
• CAH Profile assay kit (includes reagents, controls, calibrators)
• Microplate reader (if using ELISA method)
• Laboratory information system (LIS) access
1. TEST PRINCIPLE
The CAH profile for 21-Hydroxylase Deficiency involves measuring
the levels of 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP) in serum. This can
be performed using either immunoassay methods (e.g., ELISA, RIA)
or mass spectrometry (e.g., LC-MS/MS) depending on the available
laboratory resources.
1. PROCEDURE
7.1. Sample Preparation
• Allow the serum samples to come to room temperature before
testing.
• Prepare quality control samples and calibrators according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
• Centrifuge the SST tubes at 1500-2000 g for 10 minutes to ensure
clear separation of the serum.
7.2. Assay Setup (ELISA method)
• Add the appropriate volume of calibrators, controls, and patient
serum samples to the designated wells of the microplate.
• Add the assay-specific reagents (according to manufacturer's
instructions) and ensure thorough mixing.
• Incubate the plate at the specified temperature and time as per
the kit instructions.
• Wash the wells after incubation, ensuring minimal residual liquid.
• Add the substrate solution and incubate for the specified time.
• Stop the reaction by adding the stop solution.
7.3. Assay Setup (LC-MS/MS method)
• Prepare the calibration curves by diluting stock solutions of 17-
hydroxyprogesterone.
• Extract the serum samples using solid-phase extraction (SPE) or
liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) methods.
• Reconstitute the dried extracts in the mobile phase.
• Inject the samples into the LC-MS/MS system.
• Set the appropriate LC-MS/MS parameters for the detection of
17-hydroxyprogesterone.
7.4. Reading and Interpretation
• For ELISA: Measure the absorbance of each well using a
microplate reader at the specified wavelength.
• For LC-MS/MS: Analyze the chromatograms and quantify the 17-
hydroxyprogesterone levels using the calibration curve.
• Enter the results into the LIS.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run the quality control samples and calibrators with each batch of
patient samples.
• Document the results of quality control samples and ensure they
are within the acceptable range.
• If quality control results fall outside acceptable limits, troubleshoot
and repeat the assay as necessary.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Review the results for accuracy and completeness.
• Verify and release the results through the LIS.
• Report any critical values or unexpected results to the supervising
physician immediately.
1. MAINTENANCE
• Ensure all equipment is properly maintained and calibrated.
• Perform routine maintenance on the microplate reader and LC-
MS/MS system according to the manufacturer's instructions.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's instructions for the CAH Profile assay kit.
• Laboratory equipment manuals.
• CLSI guidelines for quality control and method validation.
