Protocol for Analytical Phase of Generating Results for Congenital
Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH) Newborn Screen, Blood Spot
1. PURPOSE
This protocol outlines the steps required for the analytical phase of
generating results for Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH)
newborn screening using dried blood spot samples. It includes
specimen preparation, equipment and reagent requirements, assay
procedures, quality control, and result reporting guidelines to ensure
accurate and consistent identification of infants at risk for CAH.
1. SCOPE
This protocol applies to all laboratory personnel trained in performing
CAH newborn screening using blood spot samples.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the
analyses according to this protocol. It is the responsibility of
supervisors to ensure that the procedures are followed, quality
control measures are in place, and corrective actions are taken when
necessary.
1. SPECIMEN
Preferred/acceptable: - Dried blood spot (DBS) sample
collected on standard neonatal screening filter paper (Whatman
903 or equivalent). Ensure complete saturation and drying
according to the manufacturer's guidelines.
Unacceptable: - Blood spots that are incompletely filled,
improperly dried, contaminated or poorly collected resulting in
uneven sample distribution. - Blood spots collected on non-
approved filter paper.
2. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
◦ DBS puncher
◦ HPLC or tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) system
◦ Calibration standards for MS/MS
◦ Internal controls
◦ Extraction reagents (e.g., methanol, deionized water)
◦ Assay-specific reagents and buffers
◦ Quality control materials (low, medium, high)
◦ Micropipettes and tips
◦ Vortex mixer
◦ Centrifuge
◦ Automated or manual data entry systems
3. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation 1. Punch out a 3.2mm (1/8 inch) disk
from the center of each blood spot from the DBS card using a
DBS puncher and place into well of a 96-well plate. 2. Add
extraction reagent to each well as per manufacturer's
instructions. 3. Seal the plate with suitable sealing film and mix
thoroughly using a vortex mixer. 4. Incubate the sealed plate for
the recommended duration, ensuring adequate extraction of
analytes from the DBS disk. 5. Centrifuge the plate to separate
the extract.
B. Analysis by MS/MS 1. Calibrate the MS/MS system using
calibration standards. 2. Analyze the specimens, including
external calibrators and quality control materials, according to
standard operating procedures for CAH screening. 3. Ensure
peak identification and quantification are performed according
to set parameters and thresholds.
C. Quality Control 1. Run quality control samples at low,
medium, and high levels at the start of each run. 2. Verify that
the measured values are within acceptable ranges before
proceeding with patient sample analysis. 3. If any quality control
sample falls outside the acceptable range, troubleshoot and
repeat the analysis, and review equipment calibration if
necessary.
4. REPORTING RESULTS
A. Data Review 1. Review all raw data outputs for adherence to
predefined thresholds and quality control ranges. 2. Confirm
that the screening results are within the reportable range or
marked for repeat analysis.
B. Result Interpretation 1. Results above the established cut-off
values indicate an abnormal screen result for CAH. These
results should be flagged for follow-up testing and reported
promptly to the healthcare provider. 2. Results within the normal
range should be reviewed for quality control compliance and
reported as normal.
C. Result Documentation and Verification 1. Enter results into
the Laboratory Information System (LIS) for verification. 2.
Ensure verification by a qualified technologist or laboratory
supervisor. 3. Communicate critical results promptly to the
responsible health personnel following laboratory protocol on
critical values.
5. QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSESSMENT
A. External Quality Assurance 1. Participate in external quality
assurance programs for congenital adrenal hyperplasia
newborn screening.
B. Internal Quality Control 1. Perform within-laboratory
comparisons using retained DBS samples and dedicated
quality control samples. 2. Document and address all quality
control deviations.
6. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Identify and document any limitations of the assay, including
sensitivity to variations in specimen quality, potential interfering
substances, and limits to detectability specific to the method used.
1. REFERENCES
Provide all reference material, including manufacturer's assay insert,
equipment manuals, relevant clinical guidelines, and recent scientific
literature pertinent to the CAH newborn screening assay.
