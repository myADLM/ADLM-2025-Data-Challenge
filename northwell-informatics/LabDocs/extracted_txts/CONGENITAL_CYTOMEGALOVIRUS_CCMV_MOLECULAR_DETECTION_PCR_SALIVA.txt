Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): CONGENITAL
CYTOMEGALOVIRUS (CCMV), MOLECULAR DETECTION, PCR,
SALIVA
1. PURPOSE
This procedure describes the steps for the detection of Congenital
Cytomegalovirus (CCMV) DNA in saliva samples using Polymerase
Chain Reaction (PCR) methodology. It includes the guidelines for
processing, detection, analysis, and reporting of results to ensure
reproducibility, consistency, and accuracy in line with laboratory
standards.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all personnel who are involved in the
molecular testing, detection, and reporting of CCMV using PCR in
saliva samples in a CLIA-certified laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for following this
SOP and ensuring the integrity and accuracy of results.
• Laboratory supervisors are responsible for the verification of
results, maintenance of equipment, and the implementation of
corrective actions if required.
4. SPECIMENS
4.1 Acceptable Specimens
• Saliva collected using a kit designed for molecular diagnostics
and stored according to manufacturer’s recommendations prior to
processing.
4.2 Unacceptable Specimens
• Specimens not labeled or without a matching requisition form.
• Saliva specimens leaking or collected in inappropriate containers.
• Specimens that have not been stored according to manufacturer
specifications.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS & SUPPLIES
• PCR workstation
• DNA extraction kit (validated for saliva)
• Real-time PCR machine, specific for CCMV detection
• Pipettes and aerosol-resistant tips
• Reagent reservoir
• Centrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
• CCMV PCR Master Mix
• Internal and external controls
6. PROCEDURE
6.1 Sample Preparation
1. Ensure that PPE is worn throughout the procedure.
2. Verify specimen ID and condition on the requisition form and
specimen container.
3. Vortex the saliva sample to ensure homogeneity.
6.2 DNA Extraction
1. Begin sample preparation in a designated clean area to prevent
contamination.
2. Use the DNA extraction kit according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
3. Elute the DNA in the designated elution buffer and store at
2-8ºC until PCR setup.
6.3 PCR Setup
1. Prepare master mix:
◦ Prepare according to the manufacturer’s or assay protocol,
including primers, probes, nucleotides, and DNA
polymerase.
◦ Include both positive and negative controls in each run.
2. Aliquot the master mix into the designated PCR plate or tubes.
3. Add the eluted DNA samples to the designated wells/tubes.
4. Seal the plate/tubes and centrifuge briefly to remove air
bubbles.
6.4 Real-time PCR
1. Load the prepared PCR plate/tubes into the real-time PCR
machine.
2. Set up the PCR program according to the assay’s thermal
cycling conditions.
3. Start the PCR run.
6.5 Post-PCR Analysis
1. Analyze data using appropriate software.
2. Verify the amplification curves and cycle threshold (Ct) values.
3. Compare Ct values of unknown samples against positive and
negative control curves.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Include internal and external controls in each run to validate the
PCR process.
2. Document control results and ensure they fall within the
acceptable range.
3. Review any discrepancies and perform corrective actions if
necessary.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Positive Result:
◦ If Ct value is below the established cutoff, confirm as
positive for CCMV DNA.
2. Negative Result:
◦ If no amplification occurs or Ct value is above the
established threshold, confirm as negative.
3. Include comments for any inhibited or internal control failures.
9. REFERENCE RANGES
• Positive: Detection of CCMV DNA
• Negative: No detection of CCMV DNA
10. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Ensure proper sample collection and storage to prevent DNA
degradation.
• Avoid potential PCR inhibitors in the saliva samples that can
affect amplification.
11. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's instructions for the DNA extraction kit.

12. DOCUMENTATION
Record all results, including controls, in the Laboratory Information
System (LIS). Review and verify results before releasing them.
Maintain a log of tested specimens, including positives, negatives,
and any retests.
