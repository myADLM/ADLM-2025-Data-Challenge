Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Detection of
Congenital Cytomegalovirus (CCMV) by PCR in Urine Samples
1. PURPOSE
This procedure outlines the steps for the analytical phase involved in
the detection of congenital cytomegalovirus (CCMV) using
Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) in urine samples. This ensures
accurate, reliable, and timely results for CCMV detection to aid in
diagnosis and management of congenital infections.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all staff in the molecular diagnostics laboratory
performing CCMV detection using PCR on urine specimens.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the trained laboratory personnel to perform
this procedure as described and to ensure that all quality control
measures are followed. The supervisor is responsible for ensuring
that personnel are adequately trained and that all corrective actions
are implemented as needed.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen type: Urine
• Volume: A minimum of 1 mL of urine
• Collection: Collected in a sterile container
• Storage: Refrigerated at 2-8°C if not processed immediately; can
be stored at 2-8°C for up to 24 hours.
• Unacceptable specimens: Specimens contaminated with fecal
matter, not labeled, or without collection date/time.
5. EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS
• PCR thermocycler
• Centrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Micropipettes and tips (sterile, aerosol-resistant)
• Sterile microcentrifuge tubes
• Nucleic acid extraction kit (approved for clinical use)
• PCR master mix specific for CMV detection
• Positive and negative control samples
• Molecular grade water
• Surface decontaminants (e.g., 10% bleach, RNase Away)
• Personal protective equipment (PPE) (lab coat, gloves, face
shield, etc.)
6. PROCEDURE
6.1 Preparation
1. Wear appropriate PPE.
2. Decontaminate all work surfaces and equipment with suitable
surface decontaminants.
3. Label all tubes and reagents accurately before starting the
procedure.
6.2 Nucleic Acid Extraction
1. Vortex the urine sample for 5 seconds to ensure homogeneity.
2. Transfer 1 mL of urine to a sterile microcentrifuge tube.
3. Centrifuge at 1500 x g for 10 minutes to pellet cells.
4. Carefully aspirate and discard the supernatant without
disturbing the pellet.
5. Extract nucleic acids from the cell pellet using an approved
nucleic acid extraction kit, following the manufacturer’s
instructions.
6.3 PCR Setup
1. Prepare the PCR master mix by adding the following
components in a sterile microcentrifuge tube:
◦ PCR buffer
◦ dNTP mix
◦ MgCl2 (if required)
◦ Primers specific for CMV
◦ Taq DNA polymerase
2. Add the extracted nucleic acid (template) to the master mix in
separate PCR tubes:
◦ Positive control
◦ Negative control
◦ Patient samples
3. Seal the tubes and gently mix by vortexing, then briefly
centrifuge.
6.4 PCR Cycling Conditions
1. Place the prepared PCR tubes into the PCR thermocycler.
2. Set the thermocycler with the following cycling conditions:
◦ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 5 minutes
◦ Denaturation: 95°C for 30 seconds
◦ Annealing: 55-60°C (temperature specific to primers) for 30
seconds
◦ Extension: 72°C for 1 minute
◦ Repeat for 35 cycles
◦ Final extension: 72°C for 5 minutes
◦ Hold at 4°C
6.5 Post-PCR Analysis
1. Analyze amplified products by gel electrophoresis or real-time
PCR detection as per the lab’s standard protocol.
2. Include appropriate molecular weight markers to size the PCR
products.
3. Document results and compare patient sample results with the
positive and negative controls.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Run positive and negative controls with each PCR batch to
ensure assay performance.
2. Record all quality control data and take corrective actions for
any failures as per lab’s quality management plan.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Only results from runs with valid positive and negative controls
can be reported.
2. Results are reviewed and verified by a qualified technologist or
supervisor before reporting.
3. Report results as ‘Detected’ or ‘Not Detected’ for CCMV,
including any necessary comments on sample integrity or
assay issues.

• Manufacturer’s instructions for the nucleic acid extraction kit.
• Manufacturer’s instructions for the PCR master mix.
• Relevant literature on PCR methods for CMV detection.
10. REVIEW
This SOP will be reviewed and updated every two years or as
needed based on regulatory changes or improvements in technology.
