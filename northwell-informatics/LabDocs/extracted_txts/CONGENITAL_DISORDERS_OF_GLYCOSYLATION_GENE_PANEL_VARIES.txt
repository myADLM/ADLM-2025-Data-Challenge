PROTOCOL FOR THE ANALYTICAL PHASE OF GENERATING
RESULTS FOR CONGENITAL DISORDERS OF GLYCOSYLATION
GENE PANEL
1. PURPOSE
To describe the standardized procedure for the detection and
interpretation of genetic variants in genes associated with Congenital
Disorders of Glycosylation (CDG) using a gene panel assay.
1. SCOPE
This protocol applies to all laboratory personnel trained in molecular
genetic testing procedures, specifically those trained in the use of
next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology for gene panel
assays.
1. RESPONSIBILITIES
• Technologists are responsible for conducting the assay and
ensuring adherence to this protocol.
• Supervisors are responsible for reviewing and verifying results
and ensuring all procedures are accurately followed.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Acceptable: Blood (3-5 mL in EDTA tube), extracted DNA (minimum
50 ng/uL, 1-2 µg total). Unacceptable: Hemolyzed, clotted, or
otherwise compromised specimens.
1. REAGENTS AND EQUIPMENT
• NGS platform (e.g., Illumina, Ion Torrent)
• DNA extraction kit
• Gene-specific primer panel for CDG
• Library preparation kit
• Sequencing reagents and consumables
• Bioinformatics software
1. PROCEDURE
6.1. DNA Extraction
• Extract genomic DNA from blood samples using the specified
DNA extraction kit.
• Quantify and assess the quality of extracted DNA using a
spectrophotometer and agarose gel electrophoresis.
• Ensure DNA concentration meets the minimum requirement.
6.2. Library Preparation
• Utilize the specified gene panel primers to amplify target regions
associated with CDG.
• Prepare libraries using a standard library preparation kit following
the manufacturer's instructions.
• Include positive and negative controls in the workflow.
6.3. NGS Sequencing
• Load prepared libraries onto the NGS platform following the
manufacturer’s protocol.
• Perform sequencing run with appropriate settings and read
lengths as stipulated by the gene panel manufacturer.
• Monitor run performance and quality metrics throughout the
sequencing process.
6.4. Data Analysis
• Use bioinformatics software to analyze sequencing data.
• Align sequencing reads to the human reference genome (e.g.,
hg38).
• Identify and annotate variants within the targeted genes.
• Filter variants based on quality criteria and clinical relevance.
6.5. Result Interpretation and Reporting
• Compare identified variants against databases such as ClinVar,
HGMD, and relevant literature to determine clinical significance.
• Interpret the potential impact of variants (e.g., pathogenic, likely
pathogenic, uncertain significance, likely benign, benign).
• Prepare a comprehensive report including:
◦ Patient information
◦ Methodology
◦ Identified variants and their clinical interpretation
◦ Recommendations for additional testing or family studies, if
applicable
6.6. Quality Control
• Utilize internal controls and replicate samples to ensure assay
reproducibility and accuracy.
• Review data for quality metrics such as read depth, coverage
uniformity, and base quality scores.
• Document any deviations from the protocol and corrective actions
taken.
6.7. Reporting of Results
• Reporting is performed as per site-specific guidelines.
• All results are reviewed and signed off by a qualified clinical
geneticist or molecular pathologist.
• Reports are communicated to the referring physician in a timely
and confidential manner.
1. QUALITY ASSURANCE
• Participate in external proficiency testing and inter-laboratory
comparisons to maintain assay performance.
• Regularly review and update the protocol to incorporate
advancements in technology and best practices.
1. REFERENCES
• Relevant peer-reviewed literature
• Manufacturer's instructions for all kits and equipment used
• Clinical guidelines for the interpretation of genetic variants
1. DOCUMENTATION
• Maintain records of all specimens, controls, and results.
• Archive sequencing data and analysis outputs for future reference
and compliance with regulatory requirements.
This protocol ensures a consistent, accurate, and reliable approach
to the analysis and interpretation of genetic variants associated with
Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation. Adherence to these
procedures helps deliver high-quality diagnostic results to inform
patient care.
