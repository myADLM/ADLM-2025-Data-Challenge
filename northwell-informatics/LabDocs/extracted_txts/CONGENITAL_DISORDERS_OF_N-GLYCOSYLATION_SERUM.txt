Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analysis of Congenital
Disorders of N-Glycosylation Using Serum Samples
1. PURPOSE
This procedure outlines steps for the analytical phase of processing
and analyzing serum samples to identify congenital disorders of N-
glycosylation (CDG) in a CLIA-certified laboratory.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
Staff responsible for carrying out and documenting the analysis as
specified, and ensuring results are accurate and reliable. Quality
control personnel to verify instrument calibration and method
validation.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND PREPARATION
Specimen: - Serum - Required volume: 1 mL - Collect serum in a
red-top tube or SST (serum separator tube). - Allow the blood to clot
for 20-30 minutes before centrifugation at 2000-3000g for 10
minutes. - Transfer the supernatant serum immediately to a labeled
tube. - Store serum samples at -20°C or lower until analysis.
Unacceptable Specimens: - Hemolyzed, clotted, or lipemic
samples. - Samples not stored or handled per protocol.
4. REAGENTS AND EQUIPMENT
Reagents: - Enzymes and substrates for glycan release -
Specialized glycan labeling reagents (e.g., 2-aminobenzamide) -
HPLC grade solvents (e.g., acetonitrile, water) - Calibration
standards and internal standards
Equipment: - Centrifuge - Vortex mixer - Thermal cycler or water
bath - HPLC or UPLC with fluorescence detector or MS/MS
capabilities
5. PROCEDURE
A. Glycan Release and Labeling:
1. Glycan Release: a. Thaw serum samples at room temperature.
b. Add an aliquot of 10-50 μL serum to a labeled
microcentrifuge tube. c. Add enzyme solution for glycan
release, following manufacturer's specifications. d. Incubate at
37°C for recommended duration (typically overnight).
2. Glycan Purification: a. Prepare the required resin/matrix for
glycan purification. b. Transfer incubated sample to purification
column. c. Elute glycans as per manufacturer instructions,
typically using water or a mild buffer. d. Collect eluted glycans in
a new labeled tube.
3. Labeling of Glycans: a. Dry eluted glycans under vacuum
centrifugation. b. Reconstitute dried glycans in labeling reagent
(e.g., 2-aminobenzamide). c. Heat at 65°C for 2 hours to
complete the labeling process.
B. Analysis by HPLC/MS
1. HPLC/UPLC Analysis: a. Prepare HPLC/UPLC system
following the standard setup and calibration procedures. b.
Inject 10-20 μL of labeled glycan into the system. c. Use HPLC/
UPLC gradient suitable for glycan separation. d. Monitor the
elution of glycans using fluorescence detection or MS/MS.
2. Data Collection and Analysis: a. Collect data from the
detector for each sample. b. Integrate peaks using the
appropriate software. c. Compare data against known
standards and controls.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
Internal Quality Control: a. Include positive and negative controls in
each batch analysis. b. Run quality control samples and compare
results to established ranges. c. Evaluate precision and accuracy by
analyzing replicate samples.
External Quality Control: a. Participate in proficiency testing
programs for glycan analysis. b. Review and document results from
external quality control assessments.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
Reporting: a. Review chromatograms or spectrums to confirm
glycan profile. b. Annotate any unusual peak patterns indicative of
CDG. c. Enter validated results into the Laboratory Information
System (LIS). d. Provide interpretation and comments based on the
glycan pattern observed.
Critical Results: a. Any critical findings suggesting a diagnosis of
CDG should be communicated immediately to the clinician. b.
Document communication and any follow-up actions in the laboratory
records.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
- Variability in sample collection and handling can influence results.
- Specificity of the glycan profiles can be complex and requires expert interpretation.
- User should be aware of potential interfering substances that may affect glycan release, labeling, and detection.
