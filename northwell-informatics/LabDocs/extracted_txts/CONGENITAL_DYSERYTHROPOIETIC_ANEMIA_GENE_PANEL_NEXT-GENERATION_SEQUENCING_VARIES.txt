Protocol for Congenital Dyserythropoietic Anemia Gene Panel, Next-
Generation Sequencing, Varies
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this protocol is to ensure accurate
and consistent results in the analysis of congenital
dyserythropoietic anemia gene panel using next-generation
sequencing (NGS). This protocol outlines procedures for data
generation, analysis, and reporting of identified variants.
Responsibility: It is the responsibility of all designated laboratory
personnel to follow the procedures described below and to document
any deviations or observations during the process.
1. DEFINITIONS Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS): High-
throughput sequencing methodology used to analyze multiple
genes simultaneously. Congenital Dyserythropoietic Anemia
(CDA): A rare group of hereditary anemias characterized by
abnormal red blood cell production in the bone marrow.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY Specimen
Type: Peripheral blood or bone marrow aspirate Preferred
Collection Tubes: EDTA (lavender top) Specimen Stability: Up
to 7 days at 2-8°C Unacceptable Specimens: Hemolyzed,
clotted, or improperly labeled specimens
3. PROCEDURE A) Specimen Preparation:
4. Upon receipt of the specimen, verify the integrity and proper
labeling.
5. Extract DNA from the specimen using a validated extraction
protocol.
6. Quantify the extracted DNA and assess purity using
spectrophotometric analysis (e.g., Nanodrop) and fluorometric
quantification (e.g., Qubit).
B) Library Preparation:
1. Perform library preparation using a commercially available and
validated kit for targeted sequencing of CDA-related genes.
2. Follow the manufacturer's protocol for DNA fragmentation,
adapter ligation, and library amplification.
3. Validate library quality using electrophoretic methods (e.g.,
Bioanalyzer or TapeStation).
C) Sequencing:
1. Load prepared libraries onto the NGS platform (e.g., Illumina
MiSeq, NextSeq).
2. Run sequencing according to manufacturer’s instructions.
3. Monitor sequencing run metrics in real-time to ensure optimal
performance.
D) Data Analysis:
1. Transfer sequencing data to appropriate bioinformatics software
for alignment to the reference genome and variant calling.
2. Perform initial data quality control checks - assess depth of
coverage, mapping quality, and read distribution.
3. Annotate identified variants using appropriate databases (e.g.,
ClinVar, dbSNP).
4. Interpret pathogenicity of variants based on ACMG guidelines
and database information.
E) Validation and Reporting:
1. Confirm identified variants by reviewing sequencing data and, if
necessary, performing orthogonal testing (e.g., Sanger
sequencing).
2. Prepare a detailed report summarizing the identified variants,
clinical significance, and recommendations.
3. Review the report for accuracy by a qualified geneticist or
molecular pathologist.
4. Transmit verified results to the Laboratory Information System
(LIS) and prepare results notification to ordering clinician.
5. QUALITY CONTROL A) Internal Control: Include positive and
negative controls in each sequencing run to ensure assay
reliability. Monitor sequencing quality metrics including read
depth, uniformity, and target coverage. B) Proficiency Testing:
Participate in external proficiency testing programs to ensure
accuracy and reliability of results. Regularly review proficiency
testing results and implement corrective actions as needed.
6. LIMITATIONS The results are dependent on the quality of the
DNA extracted and the depth of sequencing coverage
achieved. Certain regions of the genome may be challenging to
sequence due to high GC content, repeats, or other factors.
Results may be inconclusive without further validation by
orthogonal methods or additional clinical correlation.

control, specimen handling, and reporting.
