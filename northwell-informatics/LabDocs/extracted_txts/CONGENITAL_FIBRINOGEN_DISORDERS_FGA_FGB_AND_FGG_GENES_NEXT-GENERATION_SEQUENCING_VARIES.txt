Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Congenital Fibrinogen Disorders, FGA,
FGB, and FGG Genes, Next-Generation Sequencing
1. PURPOSE
To establish a standardized procedure for the analytical phase of
generating results for congenital fibrinogen disorders by sequencing
FGA, FGB, and FGG genes using Next-Generation Sequencing
(NGS) technology.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of designated laboratory personnel to follow
and adhere to this procedure to ensure accurate and reliable results.
All personnel are also responsible for identifying any issues and
reporting them to their supervisor.
1. EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS
• NGS Instrument (e.g., Illumina MiSeq, NextSeq)
• PCR Amplification System (e.g., thermocycler)
• NGS Library Preparation Kit (as per manufacturer protocol)
• DNA Extraction Kit (suitable for blood or tissue samples)
• Bioinformatics tools and software (e.g., BWA, GATK, IGV)
• Reagents (e.g., primers, enzymes, buffers)
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
• Centrifuge
• Micro-pipettes and sterile filter tips
• Vortex mixer
1. PROCEDURE
A. Pre-Sequencing Preparation:
1. DNA Extraction:
◦ Extract genomic DNA from the received blood or tissue
sample using a suitable DNA extraction kit according to the
manufacturer's protocol.
◦ Assess DNA quantity and quality using spectrophotometry
(e.g., NanoDrop) and fluorometry (e.g., Qubit), ensuring the
DNA meets required concentration and purity.
2. PCR Amplification:
◦ Design and validate primers specific for FGA, FGB, and
FGG genes.
◦ Amplify target regions using a thermocycler, and confirm
successful amplification by gel electrophoresis.
◦ Purify PCR products using a suitable PCR purification kit.
B. Library Preparation:
1. Fragmentation and Size Selection:
◦ Fragment DNA to the desired length (200-300 bp) using an
enzymatic DNA fragmentation kit.
◦ Use a magnetic bead-based system to select fragments of
suitable size.
2. Adapter Ligation:
◦ Ligate sequencing adapters to the fragmented DNA
according to the library preparation kit protocol.
◦ Purify the ligated fragments to remove excess adapters and
other contaminants.
3. Library Quantification and Quality Control:
◦ Quantify the prepared library using qPCR or fluorometry.
◦ Assess library size distribution using an automated
electrophoresis system (e.g., Agilent Bioanalyzer).
C. Next-Generation Sequencing:
1. Loading the Library:
◦ Normalize the library concentrations and pool multiple
samples if necessary.
◦ Load the prepared library into the sequencing platform
according to the instrument’s specifications.
2. Sequencing Run:
◦ Initialize a sequencing run on the NGS instrument following
the standard operating procedures of the platform.
◦ Monitor the sequencing run to ensure optimal performance
and troubleshoot any issues that arise.
3. Post-Sequencing Analysis:
A. Data Analysis:
1. Base Calling and Quality Control:
◦ Perform base calling and generate raw sequence data using
instrument-specific software.
◦ Conduct quality control checks of raw data (e.g., FastQC) to
assess read quality and sequence performance.
2. Read Alignment and Variant Calling:
◦ Align sequence reads to the reference genome (e.g., hg38)
using alignment software (e.g., BWA).
◦ Perform variant calling using a variant caller (e.g., GATK) to
identify single nucleotide variants (SNVs), insertions, and
deletions (indels).
3. Annotation and Interpretation:
◦ Annotate identified variants using annotation tools (e.g.,
ANNOVAR) to predict potential impacts on gene function.
◦ Review and interpret annotated variants using integrative
genomics viewer (IGV) and available databases (e.g.,
ClinVar, HGMD).
B. Data Validation and Reporting:
1. Variant Validation:
◦ Confirm critical variants by Sanger sequencing if necessary.
◦ Ensure all identified variants meet stringent quality criteria
and cross-check with known pathogenic variants associated
with congenital fibrinogen disorders.
2. Result Interpretation and Reporting:
◦ Compile a comprehensive results report including identified
variants, their pathogenicity, and clinical relevance.
◦ Review the report internally to ensure quality and accuracy.
◦ Sign off the final report by senior laboratory personnel
before releasing it to the clinician or referring laboratory.
3. QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE
A. Internal Quality Control:
• Sequence positive control samples with known variants to
validate accuracy and reproducibility of the procedure.
• Include negative controls to ensure the absence of contamination.
B. Inter-Laboratory Quality Assurance:
• Participate in external quality assessment (EQA) programs to
benchmark and validate the laboratory’s performance.
1. RECORD KEEPING AND DOCUMENTATION
• Maintain thorough documentation of the entire process, including
sample accessioning, DNA extraction, PCR amplification, library
preparation, sequencing, data analysis, and reporting.
• Store all records securely and ensure they are easily accessible
for review and audits.
