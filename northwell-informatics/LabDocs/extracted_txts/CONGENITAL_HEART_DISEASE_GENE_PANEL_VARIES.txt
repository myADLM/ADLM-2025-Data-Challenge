STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP) Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Congenital Heart Disease Gene Panel, Varies
1. PURPOSE
This procedure provides guidelines for the analytical phase of
generating results for the Congenital Heart Disease Gene Panel. It
ensures that all necessary steps are taken to achieve accurate and
reliable genetic testing results. This SOP includes DNA extraction,
library preparation, sequencing, data analysis, and result
interpretation.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
This SOP is the responsibility of designated laboratory personnel
trained in molecular techniques. All personnel must adhere to these
procedures to maintain quality and accuracy in genetic testing.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• DNA extraction kit (e.g., QIAGEN QIAamp DNA Mini Kit)
• Quantification instruments (e.g., Qubit Fluorometer, NanoDrop
Spectrophotometer)
• Sequencing library preparation kit (e.g., Illumina TruSeq DNA
Library Prep Kit - Custom Amplicon)
• Sequencer (e.g., Illumina MiSeq or NextSeq)
• Bioinformatics tools (e.g., BWA, GATK, ANNOVAR, IGV)
• Congenital Heart Disease Panel-specific reagents and primers
• Thermal Cyclers
• PCR cleanup kit (e.g., AMPure XP beads)
• Quality control materials
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) including gloves and lab
coats
1. PROCEDURE
A) DNA Extraction
1. Obtain specimens for genetic analysis. Follow specimen
collection and accessioning SOPs.
2. Extract DNA using a DNA extraction kit, following the
manufacturer’s instructions.
3. Quantitate extracted DNA using the Qubit Fluorometer and/or
NanoDrop Spectrophotometer.
4. Evaluate DNA quality by running a small aliquot on an agarose
gel or using a Fragment Analyzer.
B) Library Preparation
1. Prepare DNA libraries using the Illumina TruSeq DNA Library
Prep Kit specific for Custom Amplicon design.
2. Follow the manufacturer’s protocol, ensuring accurate pipetting
and adherence to thermal cycler conditions.
3. Purify the PCR products using AMPure XP beads to remove
unwanted fragments.
4. Quantitate and validate the prepared libraries using the Qubit
Fluorometer and ensure library size distribution using the
Fragment Analyzer.
C) Sequencing
1. Load the libraries on the appropriate sequencing platform (e.g.,
Illumina MiSeq, NextSeq) following the manufacturer’s
instructions for loading samples.
2. Perform the sequencing run following established protocols.
3. Ensure and document the proper functioning of sequencers
during the run. Monitor run progress regularly.
D) Data Analysis
1. Transfer data from sequencing platform to secure
bioinformatics workstation.
2. Use bioinformatics tools (e.g., BWA for alignment, GATK for
variant calling, ANNOVAR for annotation) to process raw data.
3. Conduct quality control checks on sequencing data. Ensure
proper reads and coverages.
4. Filter and annotate variants relevant to congenital heart disease
genes based on the panel design.
E) Result Interpretation
1. Use bioinformatics tools (e.g., IGV) for detailed visualization
and review of genetic variants.
2. Compare detected variants with known databases to interpret
clinical significance.
3. Prepare a comprehensive report including detected variants,
clinical relevance, and recommendations for follow-up.
4. Ensure that the final report is reviewed and signed off by senior
geneticists before release.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
6. Run positive and negative controls with each batch of samples
to ensure accurate capture and processing.
7. Regularly calibrate quantification instruments and sequencers
per manufacturer’s guidelines.
8. Document all quality control results and take corrective action if
any deviation from accepted parameters is observed.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
10. Review and validate the final genetic analysis results.
11. Report the findings in accordance with site-specific guidelines.
12. Notify healthcare providers of critical findings.
