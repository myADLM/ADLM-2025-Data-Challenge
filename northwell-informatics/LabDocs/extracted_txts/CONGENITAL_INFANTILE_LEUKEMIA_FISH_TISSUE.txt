Standard Operating Procedure for Analysis of CONGENITAL
INFANTILE LEUKEMIA, FISH, TISSUE
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the procedure for performing Fluorescence In Situ
Hybridization (FISH) analysis on tissue samples for the detection of
chromosomal abnormalities associated with congenital infantile
leukemia.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
• Designated Laboratory Staff: Ensure the accuracy and
efficiency of the FISH analysis.
• Supervisors and Technicians: Ensure compliance with the
procedure, including quality control and proper documentation.
1. SPECIMEN
• Acceptable: Fresh or formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE)
tissue samples received with proper documentation and within
acceptable condition as specified.
• Unacceptable: Samples without proper identification,
documentation, or those that are not received in appropriate
conditions (e.g., damaged or improperly preserved).
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, & SUPPLIES
• Fluorescent Microscope
• Hybridization Chamber
• Probe (specific to leukemia target)
• Vysis Paraffin Pretreatment Kit II
• Anti-Fade Mounting Medium
• Coverslips and Slide Warmer
• Xylene, Ethanol, and Deionized Water
• Fume Hood
1. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Preparation:
1. Process the FFPE tissue sections using xylene and ethanol for
deparaffinization and rehydration.
2. Perform antigen retrieval as per the Vysis Paraffin Pretreatment
Kit II protocol.
3. Digest tissue with protease solution exactly as directed in the kit
protocol.
4. Dehydrate sections through a graded ethanol series and air dry
thoroughly.
B. Probe Hybridization:
1. Apply 10 μL of the FISH probe to the target area of the slide.
2. Cover the applied probe with a coverslip and seal using rubber
cement or other acceptable sealant.
3. Place the slides in a hybridization chamber and denature at
72°C for 5 minutes.
4. Hybridize at 37°C overnight.
C. Post-Hybridization Washes:
1. The next day, remove coverslips carefully.
2. Wash the slides at 72°C in 0.4X SSC for 2 minutes.
3. Perform a brief wash in 2XSSC/0.1% NP-40 at room
temperature for 2 minutes.
4. Air-dry slides in the dark.
D. Detection and Mounting:
1. Apply anti-fade mounting medium to the slides.
2. Apply a coverslip, ensuring no bubbles are trapped.
3. Seal the edges of the coverslip again if necessary.
4. Allow slides to dry at room temperature protected from light.
E. Analysis and Interpretation:
1. Examine the slides under a fluorescence microscope.
2. Analyze at least 200 interphase nuclei per sample.
3. Identify and record the presence of specific chromosomal
abnormalities as indicated by the fluorescence signals.
4. Verify findings with a second technologist if necessary.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform QC using a control specimen with known targets of the
probe each run.
• Ensure probe lot and expiry dates are documented.
• All discrepancies or issues should be reported to the supervisor
immediately.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results are documented on a standardized report template.
• The report should include patient identifiers, sample identifiers,
date of test, findings (both positive and negative), and an
interpretive comment.
• All results must be reviewed and verified by a senior technologist
or supervisor.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Positive or Negative for targeted chromosomal abnormalities.
• Normal FISH signal patterns are detailed within specific leukemia
FISH probe insert.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Results may be affected by tissue quality and processing
variables.
• Potential for false positives/negatives due to suboptimal
hybridization or misinterpretation of signals.

• Vysis Paraffin Pretreatment Kit II Manual
• Probe manufacturer's instructions for use (IFU).
Documentation Compliance
• Ensure proper and complete documentation in line with laboratory
standards and regulations.
• Record calibration and maintenance logs for all equipment
utilized.
This SOP ensures thorough and accurate analysis of congenital
infantile leukemia using FISH on tissue samples, providing reliable
diagnostic information for appropriate clinical management.
