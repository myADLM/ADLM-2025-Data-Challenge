Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Protocol for Generating
Results for CONGENITAL LACTIC ACIDOSIS PANEL, VARIES
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedures for the analytical
phase of generating results for the Congenital Lactic Acidosis Panel
in a CLIA-certified laboratory. This encompasses sample processing,
testing, quality control, result validation, and reporting.
Responsibility:
• All staff involved in the handling and testing of samples for the
Congenital Lactic Acidosis Panel.
• Laboratory supervisors responsible for ensuring compliance with
procedures and corrective actions when necessary.
1. DEFINITIONS
• Congenital Lactic Acidosis: A metabolic disorder characterized
by the accumulation of lactic acid in the body due to congenital
defects in mitochondrial energy metabolism.
• Specimens: Blood, urine, or tissue samples provided for the
purpose of testing.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
• Preferred Specimens:
◦ Blood: Collected in heparinized vacutainers (dark green or
PST) or blood gas syringes. Ensure the tube is completely
filled to maintain anaerobic conditions and suitable heparin
concentration.
◦ Urine: Collected in a clean, sterile container; samples should
be transported to the laboratory within 6 hours of collection.
◦ Tissue: Collected following standard surgical procedures and
placed in appropriate transport media.
• Stability:
◦ Blood and urine specimens should be processed immediately
upon arrival.
◦ Tissue specimens should be stored according to
recommended conditions outlined in the surgical procedure
guidelines.
• Unacceptable Specimens:
◦ Specimens collected in tubes containing sodium citrate,
sodium fluoride/oxalate, or EDTA.
◦ Specimens with air bubbles greater than 10%, clotted
specimens, or specimens where the needle is still attached.
◦ For blood gas analysis, evacuated blood collection tubes (e.g.,
Vacutainers or Microtainers) are not acceptable.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Equipment:
◦ Analytical instruments specific to lactic acidosis testing (e.g.,
blood gas analyzers, mass spectrometers).
◦ Automated urinalysis instruments (for urinalysis portion).
• Reagents:
◦ Electrolyte balanced or low concentration heparin for blood
samples.
◦ Specialized reagent strips for urine analysis.
◦ Required enzymes and reagents for tissue sample analysis.
• Supplies:
◦ Blood gas syringes, heparinized vacutainers, urine containers,
tissue transport media, and necessary lab instrumentation.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Blood Specimen Testing:
1. Ensure blood specimen is mixed thoroughly and air bubbles are
expelled.
2. Perform blood gas analysis using an appropriate analyzer
according to manufacturer guidelines.
3. Carefully monitor temperature and internal controls during the
analytical process.
4. Verify results following quality control protocols.
B. Urine Specimen Testing:
1. Completely immerse reagent strip in urine sample.
2. Start timer and read each test pad at designated times.
3. For any anomalies outside expected color ranges, document
'No result due to interference.'
4. If microscopy is indicated, perform microscopic analysis as
required.
C. Tissue Specimen Testing:
1. Prepare tissue samples according to standard surgical
guidelines.
2. Analyze using mass spectrometer or enzyme assays.
3. Ensure calibration of instruments and traceable thermometers
are in place.
D. Quality Control:
• Run quality control checks with designated QC materials at
appropriate intervals.
• Use the QC material (e.g., Biorad Liquichek, Kenlor Industries) to
verify reagent strips and analytical instruments.
• Document all QC results and any corrective actions.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Ensure results are automatically transmitted to LIS for review.
• Verify and validate results, checking for sample integrity (e.g.,
hemolysis, air bubbles).
• Report results in accordance with site-specific guidelines.
• For critical results, follow protocols for documentation and
reporting, including repeat critical values.
Sample Integrity:
• Centrifuge aliquots as needed for integrity checks.
• Use best judgment for reporting results based on sample
condition.
Critical Results Handling:
• Report critically low or high potassium (K) values following
hemolysis check.
• Oximetry values >100% should be reported as 100%.
• Address printed result discrepancies or message codes by
repeating tests or following troubleshooting protocols.
Calculated Tests:
• Handle scenarios where PCO2 exceeds 110 mmHg by removing
the HCO3 and BE results and adding appropriate comments.
Analytes Unavailable:
• In emergencies, document unavailable analytes and provide
reason.

• Instrument manuals and product inserts for lactic acidosis panel
testing.
• Relevant QC and SOP documentation for blood gas analyzers,
urinalysis instruments, and mass spectrometers.
