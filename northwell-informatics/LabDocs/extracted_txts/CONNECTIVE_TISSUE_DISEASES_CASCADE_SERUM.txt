Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
CONNECTIVE TISSUE DISEASES CASCADE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
This protocol outlines the steps required to perform the Connective
Tissue Diseases Cascade, Serum testing. The procedure ensures
accurate detection and measurement of specific autoantibodies to
facilitate the diagnosis and management of connective tissue
diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjögren's
syndrome, scleroderma, and others.
Responsibility: Designated technical staff are responsible for
performing and documenting the Connective Tissue Diseases
Cascade, Serum testing according to this SOP. Supervisors are
responsible for ensuring that the testing is performed and
documented properly, including any corrective actions that may be
necessary.
1. DEFINITION
The Connective Tissue Diseases Cascade is a series of tests
performed on serum to detect the presence of autoantibodies. These
tests may include, but are not limited to, ANA (antinuclear antibody)
screening, ENA (extractable nuclear antigen) panel, anti-dsDNA, anti-
Sm, anti-RNP, anti-SSA, anti-SSB, anti-Scl-70, anti-Jo-1, and
rheumatoid factor (RF).
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Acceptable Specimen Type:
• Serum obtained from clotted blood specimens
• Collection tube: Serum separator tube (SST)
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Specimens that are hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric
• Specimens collected in anticoagulant tubes (e.g., EDTA, heparin,
citrate)
• Specimens with obvious contamination
Handling and Storage:
• Allow the blood specimen to clot at room temperature for 30
minutes and then centrifuge promptly to separate serum from
cells.
• Store serum specimens at 2-8°C if testing within 48 hours; for
longer storage, freeze at -20°C or colder.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
Equipment:
• Centrifuge
• ELISA plate reader or automated immunoassay analyzer
• Pipettes and tips
• Vortex mixer
• Incubator or water bath (if manual incubation is required)
• Timer
• Refrigerator and freezer
Reagents:
• Connective Tissue Disease Cascade kits (including required
controls and calibrators)
• Wash buffer
• Substrate solution
• Stop solution
• ANA positive and negative controls
• ENA panel controls
• Rheumatoid factor (RF) controls
1. PROCEDURE
2. Preparation: a. Bring all reagents and specimens to room
temperature before testing. b. Prepare wash buffer and other
necessary reagents according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
3. ANA Screening: a. Add the appropriate volume of patient
serum, positive control, and negative control to the wells of the
ANA screening plate. b. Incubate the plate as instructed in the
kit insert. Wash the plate thoroughly after incubation. c. Add
conjugate and incubate. Wash the plate again. d. Add substrate
solution and incubate for the recommended time. Then add
stop solution. e. Read the absorbance at the specified
wavelength using the ELISA plate reader.
4. ENA Panel: a. For ANA-positive specimens, proceed with ENA
panel testing. b. Add patient serum and controls to the ENA
microplate wells. c. Follow the incubation, washing, and
detection steps as outlined by the kit manufacturer. d. Read the
absorbance at the specified wavelengths.
5. Additional Autoantibody Tests: a. Based on clinical indication
and initial results, perform further specific autoantibody testing
(e.g., anti-dsDNA, anti-Sm, anti-RNP, etc.). b. Follow the
procedures outlined in the respective test kits for each
autoantibody. c. Document any additional steps taken or
deviations from the standard procedure.
6. Quality Control: a. Run positive and negative controls with each
batch of tests to ensure assay validity. b. Document control
results and take corrective action if controls are out of range. c.
Perform and document instrument calibrations and
maintenance as required.
7. Reporting Results: a. Review and verify test results for both
clinical and quality control samples. b. Enter results into the
Laboratory Information System (LIS) following site-specific
reporting guidelines. c. Any critical or unexpected results should
be communicated immediately to the supervising clinician.
8. LIMITATIONS
• Cross-reactivity and non-specific binding can occur with any
immunoassay. Results should be interpreted in conjunction with
clinical findings and other diagnostic tests.
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric specimens can interfere with the
assay outcomes.

dsDNA, and other autoantibody tests.

1. REVISION/REVIEW
• This SOP will be reviewed and updated annually or as needed
based on new guidelines, methods, or equipment standards.
