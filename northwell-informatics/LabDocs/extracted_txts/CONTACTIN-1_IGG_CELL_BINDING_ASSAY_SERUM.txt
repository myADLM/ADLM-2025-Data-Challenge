Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for CONTACTIN-1 IGG CELL
BINDING ASSAY, SERUM
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedure
for the analysis of CONTACTIN-1 IgG Cell Binding Assay in
serum samples. This assay is used for the detection and
quantification of IgG antibodies against CONTACTIN-1 in
patient serum, which may aid in the diagnosis of autoimmune
disorders.
Responsibility: All personnel performing the CONTACTIN-1 IgG Cell
Binding Assay must be trained and deemed competent in the
procedure. It is the responsibility of the laboratory staff to follow this
procedure meticulously to ensure accurate and reliable results.
1. SCOPE This procedure applies to all serum samples that are
submitted for CONTACTIN-1 IgG Cell Binding Assay.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Sample type: Serum
• Collection: Blood should be collected in a standard serum
separator tube (SST), allowed to clot for 30 minutes, and
centrifuged for 10 minutes at 1,000-2,000 x g. Serum should be
promptly separated from cells.
• Storage: Specimens may be stored at 2-8°C for up to 7 days. For
longer storage, serum samples should be frozen at -20°C or
-80°C. Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
• Unacceptable specimens: Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples
may compromise assay results and should be avoided.
1. EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS

• Microtiter plate reader with 450 nm filter
• Incubator at 37°C
• Vortex mixer
• Multipurpose microplate (96-well) for ELISA
• Contactin-1 antigen-coated microtiter plates
• Wash buffer
• Incubation buffer
• Contactin-1 IgG positive control
• Contactin-1 IgG negative control
• Primary antibody solution
• Secondary antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase
(HRP)
• Substrate solution (TMB)

1. PROCEDURE Note: All steps should be conducted at room
temperature (20-25°C) unless otherwise specified.
2. Sample Preparation: Thaw frozen serum samples prior to
analysis, gently mix by inversion, and centrifuge if necessary.
3. Reagent Preparation:
◦ Prepare wash buffer, incubation buffer, and substrate
solution according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Dilute primary antibody solution and secondary antibody as
specified.
4. Plate Setup:
◦ Label and arrange the microtiter plate according to the
assay template. Include wells for negative control, positive
control, and patient samples.
5. Blocking:
◦ Add 100 µL of blocking solution to each well and incubate
for 30 minutes at room temperature. Aspirate the solution.
6. Sample and Control Addition:
◦ Add 100 µL of incubation buffer to each well. Add 10 µL of
each serum sample, positive control, and negative control to
their respective wells.
◦ Incubate the plate for 1 hour at 37°C.
7. Washing:
◦ Wash the plate 5 times with 250 µL of wash buffer, ensuring
thorough removal of washing solution after each wash.
8. Primary Antibody Incubation:
◦ Add 100 µL of diluted primary antibody solution to each well.
Incubate for 1 hour at 37°C.
9. Washing:
◦ Wash the plate 5 times with wash buffer as described
previously.
10. Secondary Antibody Incubation:
◦ Add 100 µL of diluted HRP-conjugated secondary antibody
to each well. Incubate for 30 minutes at room temperature
protected from light.
11. Washing:
◦ Wash the plate 5 times with wash buffer as described
previously.
12. Substrate Reaction:
◦ Add 100 µL of TMB substrate solution to each well. Incubate
for 15 minutes at room temperature protected from light.
13. Stopping the Reaction:
◦ Add 100 µL of stop solution to each well to terminate the
reaction. The color will change from blue to yellow.
14. Reading the Plate:
◦ Measure the absorbance of each well at 450 nm using a
microplate reader within 30 minutes of adding the stop
solution.
15. CALCULATIONS AND RESULTS INTERPRETATION
• Calculate the mean absorbance values for the positive control,
negative control, and patient samples.
• Determine the cutoff value based on the negative control
absorbance mean plus three standard deviations.
• Samples with absorbance values greater than the cutoff are
considered positive for CONTACTIN-1 IgG.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run quality controls with each assay run.
• Controls must fall within their established ranges for the run to be
considered valid.
• If control values are out of range, the run must be repeated, and
the source of error investigated.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Report the results as positive or negative based on the cutoff
value.
• Results should be recorded in the laboratory information system
(LIS) promptly and reviewed by the technologist.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions for the CONTACTIN-1 IgG Cell
Binding Assay Kit.
• Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines for
validation and quality control.
1. DOCUMENTATION
• All temperature logs, maintenance logs, quality control results,
and assay runs should be documented according to laboratory
policy and retained for the specified duration.
