Controlled Substance Monitoring Enhanced Profile with Reflex:
21 Drug Classes Analytical SOP
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to provide a standardized method
for conducting controlled substance monitoring using high-resolution
mass spectrometry (HRMS) and immunoassay screening on random
urine samples. This procedure ensures accurate, reliable, and timely
results for detecting the presence of controlled substances and their
metabolites.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
Laboratory personnel trained in mass spectrometry and
immunoassay techniques are responsible for performing,
documenting, and reviewing all steps of the analysis. Supervisors are
responsible for overseeing the implementation and adherence to this
SOP.
3. SPECIMEN
Preferred/Acceptable:
• 30 mL random urine sample collected in a sterile container
without preservatives.
• Store specimens at 2-8°C if analysis is delayed beyond 1 hour,
stable for up to 72 hours when refrigerated.
Unacceptable:
• Urine samples with less than 30 mL volume.
• Samples in containers with additives or preservatives.
• Samples that are not properly labeled or without a collection date/
time.
• Specimens with severe hematuria or contamination.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• High-Resolution Mass Spectrometer (HRMS)
• Immunoassay Analyzer
• Centrifuge (for sample preparation)
• Standard laboratory glassware and micro-pipettes
Reagents:
• Immunoassay screening kits for 21 drug classes
• Calibrators and control materials
• Reagent-grade solvents and chemicals for HRMS (e.g., methanol,
acetonitrile, water)
Supplies:
• Sterile urine collection containers
• Sample preparation kits (e.g., solid-phase extraction cartridges)
• Disposable pipette tips
• Gloves, lab coats, safety goggles
5. PROCEDURE
A. Initial Immunoassay Screening:
1. Centrifuge the urine sample at 3,000 rpm for 10 minutes.
2. Transfer the supernatant to a clean tube, avoiding any solid
pellet.
3. Perform immunoassay screening for the initial detection of
controlled substances using the designated analyzer.
4. Record the results on the screening log sheet, including date,
time, and technician initials.
B. HRMS Confirmation and Quantification (Reflex Testing):
1. For any positive immunoassay screening results, prepare the
sample for HRMS analysis.
2. Follow the sample preparation protocol, including: a. Treatment
with appropriate solvents. b. Solid-phase extraction. c. Filtration
or concentration as necessary.
3. Calibrate the HRMS using appropriate calibrators and reagents.
4. Inject the prepared sample into the mass spectrometer.
5. Analyze the generated mass spectra for the presence of target
substances and their metabolites.
6. Quantify the identified substances using standard calibration
curves.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
A. Internal Quality Control:
1. Run a negative and positive control with each batch to ensure
the accuracy and reliability of immunoassay and HRMS results.
2. Document control results and verify against acceptable control
ranges.
B. External Quality Control:
1. Participate in proficiency testing programs.
2. Perform inter-laboratory comparisons of HRMS results at least
bi-annually.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Report initial immunoassay results as presumptive positive or
negative.
2. Confirmed HRMS results should include the concentration of
detected substances (ng/mL).
3. Enter and verify results in the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
4. Flag critical or unexpected results and notify the appropriate
referring physician immediately.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to specific immunoassay kit inserts and HRMS user manuals
for potential cross-reactivity, interference, and detection limits.

10. REVIEW AND UPDATES
This SOP will be reviewed annually or as required based on updated
guidelines and technological advancements. Proposed changes
should be documented and approved by laboratory supervisory staff.
