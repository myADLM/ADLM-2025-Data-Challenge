CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE MONITORING HYBRID DRUG
PROFILE, 20 DRUG CLASSES, HIGH-RESOLUTION MASS
SPECTROMETRY AND IMMUNOASSAY SCREEN, RANDOM,
URINE
1. PURPOSE
To provide standardized procedures for the analytical phase of
generating results for controlled substance monitoring through high-
resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) and immunoassay screening
for 20 drug classes in randomly collected urine samples.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel involved in the
analysis of urine samples for controlled substance monitoring using
HRMS and immunoassay screening protocols.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of trained laboratory staff to follow this protocol
accurately and document all steps and any deviations accordingly. It
is the responsibility of supervisors to ensure that staff are adequately
trained and that quality control measures are in place and adhered
to.
4. DEFINITIONS
HRMS: High-Resolution Mass Spectrometry, a technique providing
precise molecular weight measurements for identifying compounds.
Immunoassay: A biochemical test that measures the concentration of
substances through their reaction with antibodies.
5. PROCEDURE
5.1. Sample Preparation
1. Receipt of Sample: a. Ensure all urine samples have been
properly collected, labeled, and documented. b. Confirm that
samples are random and have the appropriate requisition form.
2. Sample Handling and Aliquoting: a. Mix the sample thoroughly.
b. Aliquot 5-10 mL of urine into labeled sterile containers for
analysis. c. Store aliquots at 2-8°C until processing. Do not
freeze unless specified.
5.2. Initial Screening by Immunoassay
1. Equipment and Reagents: a. Immunoassay analyzer. b.
Immunoassay reagent kits specific for the 20 drug classes.
2. Procedure: a. Load samples and reagents into the
immunoassay analyzer as per manufacturer's instructions. b.
Follow the instrument protocol to carry out the initial screening.
c. Record results in the laboratory information system (LIS).
3. Interpretation of Results: a. Positive results must be subjected
to confirmatory testing using HRMS. b. Negative results are
reported as is after review and verification by technologist.
5.3. Confirmatory Testing by HRMS
1. Equipment and Reagents: a. High-Resolution Mass
Spectrometer. b. Calibration standards and quality control
materials. c. Organic solvents and other reagents for sample
preparation.
2. Sample Preparation for HRMS: a. Centrifuge the aliquoted
urine sample at 3,000 rpm for 10 minutes. b. Transfer the
supernatant to a clean vial. c. Add internal standards as
required per HRMS protocol. d. Proceed with extraction and/or
derivatization procedures if applicable.
3. Instrument Setup and Calibration: a. Prepare the HRMS
according to the manufacturer's instructions. b. Perform
instrument calibration using appropriate standards. c. Run
quality control samples to ensure accuracy.
4. Analyzing Samples: a. Inject sample extracts into the HRMS. b.
Record chromatographic and mass spectrometric data. c. Use
validated software for peak identification and quantitation.
5. Data Interpretation: a. Compare peak data against reference
standards to identify and quantify substances. b. Review mass
spectral data for fragment ion patterns characteristic of the drug
classes being monitored. c. Document results in the LIS.
5.4. Quality Control
1. Daily Quality Control: a. Run positive and negative controls with
each batch of samples. b. Review control results before
proceeding with patient sample analysis.
2. Monthly Quality Control: a. Perform inter-instrument and inter-
lab comparisons to validate accuracy and precision. b.
Document and address any deviations observed.
5.5. Reporting Results
1. Review Ensure Integrity: a. Any discrepancies or issues with
sample integrity are documented, and the sample may need to
be reprocessed or flagged.
2. Verification: a. Technologist reviews and verifies results in LIS,
comparing immunoassay and HRMS findings.
3. Documentation: a. Results are entered into the LIS and cross-
checked for accuracy. b. Critical values or unusual findings are
verified according to laboratory protocols before release.
6. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Refer to site-specific reference intervals which may vary based on
population data or updated clinical guidelines.
