Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Analytical phase -
Controlled Substance Monitoring Panel, 11 Drug Classes,
Screen Only, Immunoassay, Oral Fluid
1. PURPOSE:
The purpose of this SOP is to describe the analytical phase
procedures for generating results for the Controlled Substance
Monitoring Panel, which screens for 11 drug classes using
immunoassay in oral fluid samples.
2. SCOPE:
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel who perform the
analytical processes for the Controlled Substance Monitoring Panel,
11 Drug Classes, Screen Only, Immunoassay, Oral Fluid tests.
3. RESPONSIBILITY:
It is the responsibility of all laboratory staff to ensure that the
procedures outlined within this SOP are followed accurately and
consistently. The supervisor is responsible for training staff,
overseeing adherence to the SOP, and addressing any deviations or
issues that may arise.
4. DEFINITIONS:
• Controlled Substance Monitoring Panel: A testing panel that
screens for the presence of controlled substances in oral fluid
samples.
• Immunoassay: A biochemical test that measures the presence or
concentration of a substance, typically using antibodies.
• Oral Fluid Sample: A sample of saliva collected from the mouth,
used for screening substances.
5. EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS:
• Immunoassay analyzer specific to oral fluid testing.
• Oral fluid collection devices (e.g., swab kits).
• Control and calibration materials specific to the substances being
tested.
• Personal protective equipment (PPE).
• Pipettes, tips, and other necessary laboratory ware.
6. PROCEDURE:
A. Sample Preparation:
1. Receipt of Samples:
◦ Upon receipt, confirm that the oral fluid samples are
properly labeled and accompanied by required
documentation.
◦ Store samples at 2-8°C if analysis is not immediately
performed. Ensure samples are brought to room
temperature prior to analysis.
2. Sample Identification:
◦ For each sample, confirm the sample ID matches the
accession records.
◦ Document any discrepancies or issues and notify the
supervisor.
B. Quality Control and Calibration:
1. Daily Calibration:
◦ Perform daily calibration of the immunoassay analyzer using
manufacturer-provided calibration materials.
◦ Document calibration results in the appropriate log.
Calibration must fall within acceptable limits before
proceeding.
2. Quality Control:
◦ Run positive and negative quality control samples before
beginning any test runs.
◦ Verify that QC results are within the prescribed ranges.
Document QC results in the appropriate log. If QC fails, do
not proceed with patient samples. Notify the supervisor and
troubleshoot as per manufacturer guidelines.
C. Sample Analysis:
1. Loading Samples:
◦ Load oral fluid samples onto the immunoassay analyzer
according to manufacturer instructions.
◦ Enter sample IDs into the analyzer's software system,
ensuring accurate data entry.
2. Running the Assay:
◦ Initiate the assay run per manufacturer instructions. Monitor
the run for any issues or errors.
◦ Document any anomalies during the assay run.
D. Results Generation:
1. Reviewing Results:
◦ Once the assay is complete, review the test results for each
sample on the analyzer.
◦ Verify control samples are within acceptable limits. If
controls are out of range, do not report patient results.
Repeat the analysis after resolving any issues.
2. Interpreting Results:
◦ Interpret results based on the cutoff values specified by the
assay manufacturer. Document results as positive or
negative for each drug class.
◦ Utilize the following classes and their respective cutoff
values as a guideline (actual values should be referenced
from the assay kit insert):
▪ Amphetamines
▪ Cocaine
▪ Marijuana (THC)
▪ Opiates
▪ PCP
▪ Benzodiazepines
▪ Barbiturates
▪ Methadone
▪ Propoxyphene
▪ Methamphetamines
▪ Tricyclic Antidepressants (TCA)
E. Reporting Results:
1. Result Documentation:
◦ Document results in the laboratory information system (LIS).
Ensure accurate entry and cross-verify with sample IDs.
◦ If results are questioned (e.g., unusual outcomes), review
and re-test if necessary.
2. Issuing Reports:
◦ Generate a final report for each patient tested. Include clear
positive or negative results for each of the 11 drug classes.
◦ Reports must be reviewed and verified by a technologist
before release.
7. QUALITY CONTROL:
• Maintain a log of all QC and calibration activities. Review logs
monthly to verify compliance and identify any trends or issues.
• Regularly perform preventive maintenance on the immunoassay
analyzer as per manufacturer guidelines.
8. TROUBLESHOOTING:
• If an instrument error occurs, follow the manufacturer’s
troubleshooting guidelines. Contact technical support if the issue
cannot be resolved.
• Document all troubleshooting steps and outcomes in the
instrument maintenance log.
9. REFERENCES:
• Manufacturer’s user manual and inserts for the immunoassay
analyzer.
• Relevant laboratory quality control policies and procedures.
10. APPROVALS:
This standard operating procedure has been reviewed and approved
by the lab supervisor and director.
