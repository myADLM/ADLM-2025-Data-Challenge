STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE
CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE MONITORING PANEL, RANDOM,
URINE
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for performing the Controlled Substance
Monitoring Panel on random urine samples to ensure accurate and
timely identification and quantification of controlled substances, their
metabolites, and other relevant substances.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel conducting controlled
substance monitoring in urine samples at [Your Laboratory Name].
3. RESPONSIBILITY
All laboratory personnel performing the Controlled Substance
Monitoring Panel are responsible for following this procedure to
ensure accurate and reliable results. It is the responsibility of the
supervisor to ensure staff adherence and to address any issues
during the testing process.
4. DEFINITIONS
Controlled Substance Monitoring Panel: A laboratory test designed to
detect and quantify specified controlled substances and their
metabolites in urine samples.
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred specimen: 30 mL of random urine collected in a sterile
container.
• Storage: If the specimen cannot be analyzed immediately, store
at 2-8°C for up to 48 hours or at -20°C for longer-term storage.
• Unacceptable specimens: Specimens with insufficient volume,
significant delays in transportation without appropriate storage, or
those with visible contamination.
6. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS) or Gas
Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) system.
• Urine preservative containers if necessary (e.g., for gamma
irradiation).
• Calibrators and controls for targeted substances.
• Reagent kits and standards specific for the controlled substances
being monitored.
• Pipettes, sterile containers, centrifuge.
7. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Handling and Preparation
1. Receive and accession the urine specimen according to
laboratory protocol.
2. Verify the specimen meets the acceptance criteria (properly
labeled, adequate volume, appropriate collection method).
3. If refrigerated or frozen, bring the specimen to room
temperature before analysis.
4. Mix the specimen thoroughly to ensure homogeneity.
B. Internal Quality Control
1. Before running patient samples, calibrate the instrument using
the appropriate calibrators.
2. Run quality control (QC) samples (low, medium, and high
concentrations) to ensure the instrument's performance meets
the laboratory's criteria.
3. Review QC results. If results are out of acceptable ranges,
troubleshoot according to instrument QA/QC procedures before
proceeding with patient samples.
C. Analysis
1. Specimen Aliquoting and Dilution:
◦ Aliquot an appropriate volume of the urine sample (typically
1-2 mL) into a clean test tube.
◦ If necessary, dilute the sample according to the reagent kit's
directions.
2. Preparation for Analysis:
◦ Prepare the sample for analysis per the instrument
manufacturer's recommendations. This may include steps
like pipetting onto sample trays, adding reagents, or loading
into the instrument.
3. Instrument Setup & Operation:
◦ Load the prepared samples, calibrators, and controls onto
the instrument.
◦ Input the required method parameters into the instrument's
software.
◦ Start the analysis sequence following the manufacturer's
protocol.
D. Data Analysis and Result Interpretation
1. Once analysis is complete, review the raw data and ensure all
QC measures are within acceptable ranges before interpreting
patient results.
2. Verify the results using the instrument's software and ensure it
meets the pre-set criteria for each controlled substance.
3. Any results exhibiting atypical chromatographic or spectral
characteristics need to be re-evaluated and possibly re-
analyzed to confirm their validity.
E. Reporting Results
1. Enter validated results into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
2. Report results according to the specific reporting guidelines,
including any critical values or findings.
3. Verify that reportable ranges and units are correctly presented.
8. TROUBLESHOOTING
If any issues arise with specimen quality, instrument malfunction, or
QC failures:
1. Re-assess the sample preparation procedure.
2. Re-run QC samples to determine if the problem persists.
3. Follow the instrument manufacturer's troubleshooting guide or
consult with the designated supervisor for further steps.
9. QUALITY CONTROL AND MAINTENANCE
1. Ensure that regular maintenance and calibration of the LC-MS/
GC-MS are performed and documented according to the
instrument's maintenance schedule.
2. Perform daily, weekly, monthly, and annual maintenance as
specified by the instrument manufacturer.
3. Document all QC, maintenance activities, and any corrective
actions taken in the appropriate logs and records.
10. SAFETY AND COMPLIANCE
Adhere to all relevant laboratory safety protocols, including the use of
Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), and proper handling and
disposal of biohazardous materials. Ensure compliance with
applicable federal, state, and local regulations on substance testing.

• Manufacturer's instrument and reagent manuals.
• Current laboratory policies and guidelines on controlled substance
testing.
12. REVIEW AND REVISION HISTORY
This SOP will be reviewed on an annual basis or as necessary to
incorporate new testing methodologies, regulatory requirements, or
laboratory policy changes.
