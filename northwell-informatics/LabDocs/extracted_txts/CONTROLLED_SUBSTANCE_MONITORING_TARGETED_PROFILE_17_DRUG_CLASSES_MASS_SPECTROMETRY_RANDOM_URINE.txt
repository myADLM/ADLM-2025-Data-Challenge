1. PURPOSE
To establish a protocol for the analytical phase of generating results
for Controlled Substance Monitoring Targeted Profile, encompassing
17 drug classes, using Mass Spectrometry on random urine samples.
Responsibility:
Designated staff are responsible for the analysis, documentation,
result verification, and reporting of Controlled Substance Monitoring
Targeted Profile. It is the responsibility of all staff to identify any
deficiencies in equipment function or procedural issues that could
impact the analysis and bring them to the attention of a supervisor.
Staff must ensure that all quality control and verification steps are
performed according to procedure.
1. DEFINITION
Controlled Substance Monitoring Targeted Profile includes analysis
for 17 drug classes in random urine samples using Mass
Spectrometry.
1. PROCEDURE
Specimen Requirements:
Preferred/Acceptable:
• 20 mL of random urine specimen collected in a sterile container,
received with proper labeling including collection time and patient
information.
Unacceptable:
• Specimens arriving in the laboratory without proper labeling,
collection date/time indicated, or in non-sterile containers.
• Specimens showing visible signs of contamination.
Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies:
• Mass spectrometer (LC-MS/MS or GC-MS)
• Calibrators, controls, and standards specific for each drug class
• Sample preparation kits (including solid-phase extraction
columns, solvents, etc.)
• Urine toxicology reagents and supplies
Procedure:
1. Specimen Preparation: a. Verify specimen integrity and
acceptability upon receipt. b. Prepare specimen using
appropriate sample preparation techniques (e.g., solid-phase
extraction). c. Ensure proper dilution and enrichment of
samples to fall within the analytical measurement range of the
mass spectrometer. d. Prepare quality control samples and
calibrators alongside test specimens.
2. Instrument Preparation: a. Calibrate the mass spectrometer
using appropriate standards for each drug class. b. Ensure
instrument is properly tuned and conditioned for optimal
performance. c. Run quality control samples to verify instrument
readiness.
3. Analysis: a. Load prepared samples into the mass
spectrometer. b. Set up data acquisition method to accurately
capture target analytes. c. Monitor processing to ensure no
deviations or anomalies during the run. d. Perform data
analysis using validated software to identify and quantify each
controlled substance present in the sample.
4. Result Verification and Reporting: a. Review raw data for each
test run for accuracy and precision. b. Verify results against
known controls and calibrators to ensure no discrepancies. c.
Report results following laboratory-specific guidelines including
flagging any critical or abnormal results. d. Document the final
results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS) ensuring all
necessary details including initials of verifying technologist.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
Quality Control Methods:
• Run internal controls with each batch of samples including
positive and negative controls for each drug class.
• Outliers identified in quality control results must be addressed and
resolved before clinical results are reported.
• Maintain instrument performance logs and recalibrate as needed
to ensure sustained accuracy of results.
Documentation:
• Maintain detailed logs of all specimen preparations, instrument
calibrations, quality controls, and analysis runs.
• Incorporate electronic records into LIS for easier access and
tracking of specimen and result history.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
Results will be reported into the LIS and reviewed by the supervising
technologist before verification. Critical values will be highlighted and
directly reported following laboratory policies for critical value
reporting. Ensure the accuracy and completeness of all reported data
including patient identifiers and testing specifics.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the specific mass spectrometer and reagent insert
documentation for limitations on detecting and quantifying the target
analytes within the urine matrix. Be aware of potential interferences
or degradation products that can impact result accuracy.
