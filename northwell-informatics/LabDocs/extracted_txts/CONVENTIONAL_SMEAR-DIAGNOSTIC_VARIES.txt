Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Conventional Smear-
Diagnostic
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for generating results for conventional
smear-diagnostic tests in order to ensure accurate, reliable, and
consistent reporting of patient results.
Responsibility:
Designated staff members perform the smear analysis and document
results in accordance with this procedure. The responsibility also lies
with all staff to identify and report any issues that may impact the
accuracy or reliability of test results to a supervisor immediately.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Ensure the specimen received has already been accessioned and
meets the following criteria:
Preferred/Acceptable Specimens:
• Freshly collected samples, processed promptly to avoid
degeneration.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens that have been compromised (contaminated,
unproperly stored, mislabeled, etc.).
• Specimens that exceed the acceptable time frame from collection
to analysis.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
A) Microscopes: - Light microscope - Fluorescence microscope (if
applicable)
B) Staining solutions: - Gram's stain - Ziehl-Neelsen stain -
Papanicolaou stain - Other specific stains as required
C) Slides and coverslips
D) Immersion oil
E) Quality control materials
F) Logbooks and documentation tools
1. PROCEDURE
A) Specimen Preparation: 1. Ensure proper specimen handling and
preparation as per the specimen type. 2. Label slides with the
specimen ID. 3. Prepare smears by placing a small amount of
specimen on a clean slide. 4. Spread the specimen into a thin, even
smear using a spreader slide.
B) Staining: 1. Air-dry the smear completely. 2. Fix the smear using
heat or methanol fixation. 3. Stain the smear using the appropriate
staining technique corresponding to the test required (e.g., Gram's
stain for bacterial identification, Ziehl-Neelsen for acid-fast bacilli,
Papanicolaou for cytology). 4. Follow the exact staining protocol as
per manufacturer's instructions or laboratory standard techniques.
C) Microscopic Examination: 1. Focus the microscope on the smear
using low power objective. 2. Switch to higher power (40x) and then
oil immersion (100x) as necessary. 3. Perform a systematic
examination of the entire area of the smear. 4. Document findings
using standardized reporting guidelines.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
A) Quality Control Procedures: 1. Use positive and negative control
slides to validate staining quality. 2. Document quality control checks
in the logbooks. 3. Troubleshoot any issues with staining or slide
preparation immediately and notify the supervisor.
B) Equipment Maintenance: 1. Clean and calibrate microscopes
regularly. 2. Perform routine maintenance checks as per
manufacturer's guidelines.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
A) Result Documentation: 1. Enter findings into the laboratory
information system (LIS). 2. Provide detailed notes on identified
organisms or diagnostic findings. 3. Apply appropriate coding and
comments for unclear or unexpected results.
B) Reference Intervals: - Interpret results according to reference
intervals specific to the test and smear type.
C) Critical Results Reporting: 1. Immediately notify attending
physicians of any critical results. 2. Document call and details.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Acknowledge limitations based on specimen quality, staining
technique, and microscopist expertise. Refer to specific stain
limitations as provided.
