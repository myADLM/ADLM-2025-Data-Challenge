Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Conventional Smear-Screen
1. PURPOSE
To provide accurate and reliable analysis of cytological slides
prepared from various specimen types (e.g., cervical, sputum, body
fluids) for the detection of cellular abnormalities, inflammation,
infections, and other pathological conditions.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel responsible for
performing cytological smear screening using conventional methods
within the CLIA-certified laboratory. It covers the procedures for
sample preparation, staining, microscopic examination, and result
documentation.
3. RESPONSIBILITIES
• Laboratory Technicians/Technologists: Responsible for
preparing and staining slides, performing microscopic
examination, and recording results.
• Pathologists/Cytotechnologists: Responsible for reviewing
slides, making final diagnoses, and documenting findings.
• Supervisors/Managers: Ensure that all procedures are
performed according to the SOP, and any deviations or issues are
promptly addressed.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Acceptable specimens include cervical samples (Pap smears),
sputum, pleural fluid, peritoneal fluid, urine, cerebrospinal fluid
(CSF), and other body fluids as specified.
• Specimens should be received in appropriate collection
containers and transported to the laboratory as per standard
protocols.
• Unacceptable specimens include those that are improperly
labelled, leaked, or not stored/transported correctly, affecting
sample integrity.
5. MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT
• Microscope slides
• Cytological fixatives (e.g., 95% ethanol, spray fixative)
• Staining reagents (e.g., Papanicolaou (Pap) stain, Hematoxylin
and Eosin (H&E) stain)
• Light microscope with appropriate magnification settings
• Cytology screening forms or electronic reporting system
• Laboratory timer
• PPE (Personal Protective Equipment)
6. PROCEDURE
A) Specimen Preparation:
1. Labeling:
◦ Clearly label slides with the patient's name, unique
identification number, specimen type, and date of collection
using a frosted-end slide or a slide label.
2. Smear Preparation:
◦ Using a sterile applicator, gently spread the cellular material
thinly and evenly onto a clean microscope slide.
◦ Prepare multiple slides if necessary to ensure adequate
cellular material is present for examination.
3. Fixation:
◦ Immediately fix the smear by immersing it in 95% ethanol for
a minimum of 15 minutes or by using a spray fixative.
◦ Ensure that the fixative covers the entire smear to prevent
air-drying artifacts.
B) Staining:
1. Papanicolaou (Pap) Stain:
◦ Dunk the fixed slides in the following sequence of staining
reagents: a. Hematoxylin for nuclear staining. b. Rinse in tap
water. c. Bluing reagent. d. Rinse in tap water. e. Orange G
for cytoplasmic staining. f. Rinse in 95% ethanol. g. Eosin
Azure (EA) for cytoplasmic staining. h. Dehydrate through
graded ethanol series. i. Clear in xylene or xylene substitute.
2. Alternative Stains:
◦ For non-gynecological samples, use Hematoxylin and Eosin
(H&E) or other appropriate stains as per standard protocols.
C) Microscopic Examination:
1. Initial Screening:
◦ Perform a systematic microscopic examination at low (10x)
and high (40x) magnification to identify any cellular
abnormalities, inflammation, infections, or other significant
findings.
2. Criteria for Review:
◦ Identify and mark any abnormal cells, including atypical
squamous cells, malignant cells, fungal organisms, bacteria,
and other notable findings.
◦ Document findings according to established criteria and
classification systems (e.g., Bethesda System for cervical
cytology).
D) Recording and Reporting Results:
1. Documentation:
◦ Enter all preliminary findings into the appropriate cytology
screening form or electronic reporting system.
◦ Use standardized terminology for cytological interpretations.
2. Review by Pathologist/Cytotechnologist:
◦ Submit the slides with preliminary findings to a certified
cytologist or pathologist for further review and final
diagnosis.
◦ Ensure that any significant discrepancies between the initial
screening and the final diagnosis are documented and
resolved.
3. Reporting:
◦ Final results should be reviewed and verified for accuracy.
◦ Results should be communicated to the requesting
physician or clinical team in a timely manner.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Ensure that all staining reagents are prepared and used
according to manufacturers' instructions.
• Regularly verify the performance of microscopes and staining
protocols.
• Participate in external and internal quality assurance programs.

9. REFERENCES
Include any reference texts, external guidelines, or sources of
additional information that laboratory personnel can consult for
detailed protocols or clarification.
10. DOCUMENT CONTROL
• The SOP must be reviewed annually and revised as necessary.
• Updates and revisions should be recorded in the document
control system with appropriate version numbers and dates.
