Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Copeptin ProAVP, Plasma
1. PURPOSE
This document outlines the procedure for the analytical phase of
generating results for Copeptin ProAVP in plasma specimens. It
includes specimen handling, equipment and reagents, analytical
procedures, quality control, result reporting and method limitations.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for
performing and documenting all steps of the analytical process.
Laboratory supervisors or designated staff must ensure adherence to
the procedures and address any deviations or deficiencies promptly.
1. DEFINITION
Copeptin ProAVP (C-terminal pro-arginine vasopressin) is a
surrogate marker for vasopressin secretion. It is measured in plasma
specimens using specific immunoassays.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Preferred Specimen:
• Plasma collected in EDTA (Lavender-top tube).
Stability:
• Refrigerated (2-8°C) specimens are stable for up to 48 hours
post-collection.
• Frozen (-20°C or below) specimens are stable for up to 6 months.
Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Copeptin ProAVP immunoassay analyzer (e.g., automated
immunoassay system).
• Centrifuge.
Reagents:
• Copeptin ProAVP reagent kit.
◦ Calibrators.
◦ Controls (low and high).
◦ Assay buffer.
◦ Wash solution.
Supplies:
• EDTA plasma collection tubes.
• Micropipettes and pipette tips.
• Conical centrifuge tubes (15 mL).
• Sample storage vials.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Preparation:
1. Upon receipt, verify specimen labeling and integrity. Reject
specimens with significant hemolysis or improperly labeled/
collected.
2. Centrifuge the EDTA plasma collection tube at 1500 x g for 15
minutes at room temperature.
3. Aliquot plasma into secondary storage vials. Note: Minimize
freeze-thaw cycles by aliquoting into appropriate volumes.
B. Assay Setup:
1. Power on the Copeptin ProAVP immunoassay analyzer.
Conduct initial equipment checks as per manufacturer's
guidelines.
2. Load the Copeptin ProAVP reagent kit onto the analyzer.
Ensure reagents are at room temperature before use.
3. Program the analyzer according to the provided assay protocol,
including calibrators, controls, and patient samples.
4. Load plasma specimen aliquots onto the analyzer tray following
the sample identification protocol (ensure proper labeling).
5. Initiate the assay. Allow the analyzer to process and measure
the Copeptin ProAVP levels.
C. Quality Control:
1. Run quality control samples at both low and high levels with
each batch of tests.
2. Review QC results. Acceptable ranges must be verified before
reporting patient results. If QC results fall outside acceptable
limits, investigate and document any corrective actions taken.
3. REPORTING RESULTS
4. Validation of Results: Upon assay completion, review results
generated by the analyzer. Validate proper QC performance.
5. Documentation: Record all results, including controls,
calibration data, and patient sample measurements.
6. Transmitting Results: Results are automatically transmitted to
the Laboratory Information System (LIS) after validation.
Ensure data accuracy during transfer.
7. Critical Values: Report critical values immediately per
laboratory policy. Document the communication and actions
taken.
8. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Copeptin ProAVP reference intervals will be provided by the
assay manufacturer and should be validated against the
population studied before implementation.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to Copeptin ProAVP reagent kit insert for specific assay
limitations and troubleshooting. Notably:
• Significant hemolysis, lipemia, or icterus may affect assay
accuracy.
• Ensure specimens are free from any cross-reactive substances
as outlined in the manufacturer’s insert.
