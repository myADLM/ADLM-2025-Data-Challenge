STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase Protocol for Generating Results for COPPER,
24 HOUR, URINE
1. PURPOSE:
To provide a standardized procedure for the accurate and reliable
analysis of copper in a 24-hour urine specimen to ensure quality and
consistency in reporting results.
1. RESPONSIBILITY:
• Designated laboratory technologists are responsible for
conducting the assay and reporting the copper concentration in
24-hour urine specimens.
• Laboratory supervisors are responsible for overseeing compliance
with the protocol and providing support as needed.
1. SPECIMEN:
• Specimen Type: 24-hour urine collection.
• Collection Requirements: Instruct the patient to collect all urine
produced in a 24-hour period in a clean, appropriate container
provided by the laboratory.
• Volume: Record the total volume of the 24-hour urine collection to
be noted on the requisition form.
• Preservation: If not processed immediately, the specimen should
be stored at 2-8°C.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES:
• Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer (AAS) or Inductively
Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer (ICP-MS)
• Copper standard solutions for calibration
• Quality control materials (known concentration copper solutions)
• Reagents for acid digestion (e.g., Nitric acid)
• Certified trace metal-free laboratory supplies
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
• Appropriate sample containers for aliquoting
1. PROCEDURE:
A) PRELIMINARY STEPS:
• Ensure that all equipment is properly calibrated and functioning.
• A daily calibration of the AAS/ICP-MS using copper standards at
different concentrations.
• Run a blank sample to ensure no contamination.
B) SAMPLE PREPARATION:
• Aliquot a 10 mL sample of the 24-hour urine specimen.
• Digest samples with nitric acid to ensure all copper is in solution
and to remove interfering substances.
• Cool the digested solution and dilute to a final volume, as per
method requirements.
C) INSTRUMENT ANALYSIS:
• Load samples, standards, and quality control (QC) samples into
the AAS/ICP-MS.
• Initiate the sequence run and monitor instrument performance.
• Ensure that QC samples are within acceptable limits before
proceeding with patient sample analysis.
D) TEST EXECUTION:
• Analyze the prepared samples according to the instrument and
method protocols.
• Document the detection of copper concentration in micrograms
per liter (µg/L) from the AAS/ICP-MS output.
• Calculate the total copper excreted over 24 hours using the
formula: Total Copper (µg/24 hours) = Copper concentration (µg/
L) x Total urine volume (L)
1. QUALITY CONTROL:
• Use pre-defined QC materials to verify the accuracy and precision
of the assay.
• If QC materials are out of acceptable range, troubleshoot the
instrument and repeat calibration and analysis before testing
patient samples.
1. REPORTING RESULTS:
• Review the raw data and calculated results for accuracy.
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Report the final concentration of copper in µg/24 hours in the
patient's record.
• Ensure critical results are communicated immediately to the
physician or requesting party as per laboratory policy.
1. REFERENCE INTERVAL:
• Reference intervals may vary based on patient demographics and
should be compared to the laboratory's validated ranges.
1. LIMITATIONS:
• Hemolysis or contamination during collection can affect the
accuracy of results.
• Interference from other metals present in the urine may require
additional steps for removal or correction during analysis.
1. SAFETY:
• Use PPE at all times when handling patient specimens or
chemical reagents.
• Follow standard laboratory safety protocols for disposal of
biohazardous and chemical waste.
1. REFERENCES:
• Include details from manufacturer's manuals for equipment (AAS/
ICP-MS).
• Reference specific standardized testing guidelines for copper
analysis in urine.
This concludes the protocol for the analytical phase of generating
results for COPPER, 24 HOUR, URINE. Always ensure that the latest
best practices and technology upgrades are incorporated into the
procedure and staff are periodically trained on updated protocols.
