Protocol for the Analytical Phase of Generating Results for
Copper/Creatinine Ratio, Random, Urine
1. Purpose
To provide accurate and reliable quantitative results for the
copper/creatinine ratio in random urine specimens.
2. Specimen Requirements and Stability
Specimen:
Preferred/acceptable:
- Collect a random urine sample in a clean, dry, screw-capped plastic container. Recommended volume is at least 10 mL of urine.
Unacceptable:
- Specimens contaminated with preservatives or additives.
- Specimens without proper labeling indicating patient identification and time/date of collection.
Specimen Stability:
- At room temperature (20-25°C): Stable for up to 2 hours.
- Refrigerated (2-8°C): Stable for up to 24 hours.
- Frozen (-20°C or lower): Stable for up to 1 month.
1. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies
Equipment:
◦ Centrifuge
◦ Calibrated analytical balance
◦ Atomic absorption spectrophotometer or Inductively
Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer (ICP-MS) for Copper
analysis.
◦ Automated or manual Creatinine analyzer.
Reagents and Supplies:
◦ Standard Copper solution for calibration
◦ Creatinine reagent kits
◦ Control materials with known Copper and Creatinine
concentrations.
◦ Dilution solution (e.g., deionized water or buffer solution as
specified by the assay manufacturer)
2. Procedure
A. Sample Preparation:
1. Centrifuge the urine sample at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes to
remove any particulate matter.
2. Decant the supernatant into a clean polypropylene tube for
analysis.
3. If necessary, dilute sample for copper analysis according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
B. Copper Analysis:
1. Calibrate the atomic absorption spectrophotometer or ICP-MS
using standard Copper solutions.
2. Analyze the prepared urine sample for Copper concentration.
3. Record the Copper results in µg/L or the appropriate unit.
C. Creatinine Analysis:
1. Using the automated or manual Creatinine analyzer, measure
the Creatinine concentration in the urine sample.
2. Record the Creatinine results in mg/dL or the appropriate unit.
D. Calculation of Copper/Creatinine Ratio:
1. Convert Creatinine concentration to the same unit if necessary
(e.g., µg/dL).
2. Calculate the Copper/Creatinine ratio using the formula:
Copper/Creatinine Ratio = (Copper concentration in µg/L) /
(Creatinine concentration in µg/dL)
3. Record the calculated ratio.
4. Quality Control
A. Internal Quality Control:
1. Run control materials containing known concentrations of Copper and Creatinine at the beginning of each analytical run.
2. Inspection of control results to ensure they fall within established acceptable ranges.
3. Document all control results.
B. Instrument Calibration:
1. Verify calibration of analytical instruments (spectrophotometer and creatinine analyzer) before performing any sample analysis.
2. Record calibration data and corrective actions taken if calibration is not acceptable.
C. Proficiency Testing:
1. Participate in external proficiency testing programs to ensure assay accuracy and reliability.
2. Review and compare proficiency test results to internal QC data; take corrective actions when necessary.
5. Reporting Results
A. Verification:
1. Review results to ensure they meet quality control standards.
2. Confirm the Copper/Creatinine ratio calculations are accurate and within the reportable range.
B. Documentation:
1. Record the Copper and Creatinine concentrations as well as the calculated ratio in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
2. Include any comments on sample integrity or any notable observations (e.g., interference).
C. Results Communication:
1. Verify and release results to the attending physician through the LIS.
2. Provide interpretative comments or reference ranges as applicable.
6. Reference Intervals
When reporting results, include reference intervals or
interpretative ranges for the Copper/Creatinine ratio.
7. Method Limitations
Refer to the specific assay and instrument manuals for
limitations related to sensitivity, specificity, and potential
interferences.
