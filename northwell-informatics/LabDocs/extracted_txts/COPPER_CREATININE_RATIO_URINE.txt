SOP: Analytical Phase - Copper/Creatinine Ratio, Urine
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the analysis of Copper/
Creatinine Ratio in urine samples within a CLIA-certified laboratory to
ensure accurate and reliable test results.
1. SPECIMEN
Preferred/Acceptable Specimen:
◦ 10 mL random urine collection in a clean, sterile container.
◦ pH adjusted urine, if indicated, with pH between 7.0 and 8.0.
Unacceptable Specimen:
◦ Urine samples that are less than 10 mL.
◦ Urine samples that have been contaminated or show visible
signs of bacterial growth.
◦ Urine samples more than 24 hours old without proper
preservation.
◦ Samples with no collection date/time documented.
2. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
◦ Atomic Absorption Spectrometer (AAS) or Inductively
Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer (ICP-MS).
◦ Standard laboratory glassware (volumetric flasks, pipettes,
etc.).
◦ Calibration standards for copper.
◦ Quality control materials: low, medium, and high
concentration copper control solutions.
◦ Creatinine reagent and analyzers.
◦ Urine containers and appropriate labeling materials.
◦ Deionized water.
3. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation and Calibration:
◦ Turn on the AAS or ICP-MS instrument and allow it to warm
up according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Calibrate the instrument using calibration standards for
copper. Perform a multi-point calibration (typically five
points) and ensure linearity.
◦ Prepare calibration standards by diluting a certified copper
standard solution with deionized water.
B. Sample Preparation:
◦ Vortex the urine sample to ensure homogeneity.
◦ If necessary, adjust the pH of the urine sample to between
7.0 and 8.0 using a buffer solution.
◦ Aliquot 1 mL of urine sample into a clean test tube.
◦ Add an equal volume of deionized water to the aliquot and
mix well.
C. Copper Analysis:
◦ Pipette an appropriate volume (e.g., 0.5 mL) of the prepared
urine sample into the AAS or ICP-MS sample container.
◦ Run the sample through the AAS or ICP-MS to measure the
concentration of copper.
◦ Record the copper concentration in µg/L.
D. Creatinine Quantification:
◦ Follow standard laboratory protocols for creatinine analysis
using a creatinine reagent analyzer.
◦ Measure and record the creatinine concentration in the urine
sample in mg/dL.
E. Calculation of Copper/Creatinine Ratio:
◦ Convert the copper concentration from µg/L to µg/dL.
◦ Calculate the Copper/Creatinine ratio using the formula:
[ \text{Copper/Creatinine Ratio} = \frac{\text{Copper
concentration} (\mu g/dL)}{\text{Creatinine concentration}
(mg/dL)} ]
◦ Express the result as µg of copper per mg of creatinine (µg/
mg).
4. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Run quality control samples at low, medium, and high
copper concentrations at the beginning of each analytical
run and after every 20 patient samples.
◦ Ensure results fall within the established control range.
◦ Document all quality control results and take appropriate
corrective action if any QC result falls outside the
acceptable range.
5. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ Enter the Copper/Creatinine ratio results into the Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
◦ All results must be reviewed and verified by a trained
technologist before release.
◦ Report any test results that fall outside of the established
reference intervals clearly and follow up with additional
testing if necessary.
6. REFERENCE INTERVALS
◦ Reference intervals for Copper/Creatinine ratio should be
established based on population studies from your
institution or as provided by reputable medical sources.
◦ Example: Reference intervals may be: 0.03-0.2 µg/mg for
adults.
7. METHOD LIMITATIONS
◦ Ensure adequate sample preparation to avoid contamination
and matrix effects.
◦ Be aware of potential interferences from other metal ions in
the urine.
8. REFERENCES
◦ Manufacturer's instructions for AAS or ICP-MS.
◦ National and international guidelines for metal analysis in
biological samples.
◦ Relevant clinical literature regarding copper analysis in
urine.
By following these procedures, the laboratory ensures accuracy,
reliability, and consistency in the analysis of Copper/Creatinine ratio
in urine samples.
