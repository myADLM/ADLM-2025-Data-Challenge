Protocol for Analytical Phase: Generating Results for COPPER,
LIVER TISSUE
1. PURPOSE
To ensure the accurate and precise measurement and reporting of
copper concentration in liver tissue samples. This protocol outlines
the steps required for preparation, analysis, and documentation
necessary to achieve this.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory staff to follow the
procedures outlined in this protocol in order to accurately analyze
copper levels in liver tissue samples. All staff members are required
to report deviations or issues encountered during the process to their
supervisor immediately.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Type: Liver tissue
• Storage: Liver tissue samples must be stored at -20°C until
analysis.
• Unacceptable Conditions: Samples that are decomposed,
contaminated, or improperly labeled.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• AAS (Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer) or ICP-MS
(Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry)
• Standard copper solutions for calibration
• Nitric acid (trace metal grade)
• Perchloric acid
• Hydrogen peroxide
• Homogenizer
• Centrifuge
• Dilution vessels
• Drying oven
• Analytical balance (precision up to ±0.001 g)
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
• Calibration standards traceable to NIST
5. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation of Liver Tissue Samples
1. Weigh approximately 1g of liver tissue on an analytical balance
and record the weight.
2. Homogenize the liver tissue with a homogenizer.
3. Transfer the homogenized tissue to a digestion vessel.
4. Add 8 mL of nitric acid and 2 mL of perchloric acid to the vessel.
5. Heat the digestion vessel in a drying oven at 120°C until
complete digestion is achieved.
6. Allow the vessel to cool to room temperature.
7. Add 2 mL of hydrogen peroxide to the digested sample to
ensure complete oxidation.
8. Dilute the digested sample to a final volume of 50 mL using
deionized water.
9. Centrifuge the diluted sample at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes to
remove any particulates.
B. Calibration and Instrument Setup
1. Prepare a series of copper standards by diluting the standard
copper solution to the desired concentrations (e.g., 10, 20, 50,
100, and 200 μg/L).
2. Calibrate the AAS or ICP-MS instrument using these copper
standards ensuring instrument linearity and accuracy.
3. Validate calibration against a certified reference material
(CRM).
4. Document calibration data, including standard readings and any
adjustments made.
C. Sample Analysis
1. Load the prepared liver tissue samples into the AAS or ICP-MS
instrument.
2. Perform the analysis according to instrument manufacturer
protocols.
3. Record instrument settings, including detection limits,
wavelengths, and analysis conditions.
4. Analyze each sample in duplicate to ensure reproducibility.
D. Quality Control
1. Include both positive and negative quality control samples in
each batch of analysis.
◦ Positive QC: Known concentration liver tissue sample.
◦ Negative QC: Blank sample with deionized water.
2. Evaluate QC sample results to ensure within acceptable limits
(specified by laboratory guidelines).
◦ Positive QC recovery should be within ±10% of known
value.
◦ Negative QC should show no detectable copper.
3. If QC fails, troubleshoot instrument and re-calibrate before
proceeding.
E. Data Reporting and Documentation
1. Document all sample identifiers, analytical conditions, results,
and observations in the laboratory information system (LIS).
2. Verify results by cross-checking duplicates and confirming QC
compliance.
3. Report copper concentration results in micrograms per gram
(μg/g) of liver tissue.
4. Include relevant comments and observations, noting any
anomalies or unusual findings.
6. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Copper concentration in liver tissue: <35 μg/g (normal range),
35-150 μg/g (elevated), >150 μg/g (toxic).
7. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Heavy tissue contamination may interfere with the accuracy of the
result.
• Method sensitivity is limited to the instrument capabilities (AAS vs
ICP-MS).
8. SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS
• Use PPE, including gloves, lab coats, and face shields when
handling acids and liver tissues.
• Follow proper waste disposal protocols for chemical waste.
• Ensure ventilation when performing digestion procedures.

This protocol aims to ensure the precise and reliable measurement of
copper in liver tissue, providing dependable results for clinical
assessments. All laboratory personnel must adhere to these
procedures to maintain test accuracy and compliance with regulatory
standards.
