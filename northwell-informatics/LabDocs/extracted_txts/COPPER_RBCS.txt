SOP for the Analysis of Copper in Red Blood Cells
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedure for the analysis
of copper in red blood cells (RBCs). Accurate measurement of
copper levels in RBCs is essential for the diagnosis and monitoring of
conditions such as Wilson's disease, copper deficiencies, and other
disorders affecting copper metabolism.
2. SPECIMEN
Specimen Requirement:
• Preferred specimen: Whole blood collected in Trace Element
EDTA tubes.
• Volume required: Minimum 3 mL whole blood.
Specimen Stability:
• Whole blood specimen is stable for 24 hours at room temperature
and up to 72 hours refrigerated (2-8°C).
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens collected in non-trace element tubes.
• Specimens with significant hemolysis or clotted specimens.
• Specimens collected more than 72 hours before analysis.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer (AAS) or Inductively
Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) for copper
analysis.
• Trace Element EDTA blood collection tubes.
• Centrifuge.
• Micropipettes and tips.
• Copper reference standards.
• Quality control materials.
• Red blood cell lysing reagent.
4. PROCEDURE
Preparation of RBC Lysate:
1. Upon receiving the whole blood specimen, gently mix the
sample to ensure homogeneity.
2. Using a micropipette, aliquot 1 mL of whole blood into a 1.5 mL
microcentrifuge tube.
3. Centrifuge at 2,000 x g for 10 minutes to separate plasma from
RBCs.
4. Carefully remove the plasma and buffy coat without disturbing
the RBC pellet.
5. Wash the RBC pellet by adding an equal volume of saline, mix
gently, and centrifuge at 2,000 x g for 5 minutes. Discard
supernatant.
6. Repeat the washing step twice more.
7. After the final wash, add 1 mL of RBC lysing reagent and gently
mix to lyse the RBCs.
8. Allow the mixture to incubate at room temperature for 15
minutes.
Copper Analysis:
1. Prepare copper calibration standards according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Run the calibration standards on the AAS or ICP-MS to
establish the calibration curve.
3. Prepare quality control samples and analyze them to ensure
the accuracy of the instrument.
4. Pipette 50 µL of the RBC lysate into an appropriately labeled
polypropylene tube.
5. Add 950 µL of diluent (such as deionized water or specific
diluent required by the instrument).
6. Mix the sample thoroughly.
7. Aspirate the diluted lysate into the AAS or ICP-MS following the
instrument’s operating procedure.
8. Record the copper concentration as obtained from the
instrument’s readout.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
Material:
• Internal Quality Control Materials: Copper standards at different
concentrations.
• External proficiency testing materials as available.
Procedure:
• Run two levels of internal quality control at the beginning of each
batch and after every 20 samples.
• Verify QC results against acceptable ranges. If QC values are
outside acceptable limits, recalibrate the instrument and
reanalyze QC samples.
• Document all QC results in the log.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results are automatically transmitted to the Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
• Review and verify results to ensure they fall within the established
reference ranges.
• Any results that are questionable due to sample integrity must be
repeated.
7. REFERENCE INTERVALS
The reference interval for copper in RBCs will vary depending on the
population studied. It must be established by each laboratory based
on their patient population and verified against literature values.
Typical reference intervals are:
• Copper, RBCs: 700 - 1,300 ng/mL
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
This method may be affected by:
• Hemolysis: Significant hemolysis can falsely elevate copper
levels.
• Specimen condition: Incorrect collection or handling can lead to
erroneous results.
• Interferences: Certain medications or dietary supplements.
9. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s guidelines for the use of AAS and ICP-MS.
• Clinical guidelines for the diagnosis and monitoring of Wilson’s
disease.
• Peer-reviewed journals detailing the methodology and reference
intervals for copper analysis in RBCs.
10. ATTACHMENTS
