Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) for Analytical Phase:
Copper, Serum
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to provide standardized instructions
for the accurate and precise measurement of copper concentration in
serum samples in the laboratory. This SOP ensures consistency,
reliability, and quality in generating laboratory results for serum
copper analysis.
Responsibility: It is the responsibility of all qualified laboratory
personnel to follow this SOP when measuring copper concentration
in serum samples. The supervisor ensures adherence to the
procedures, proper documentation, and timely intervention in case of
any discrepancies.
1. DEFINITION
Serum copper measurement is a quantitative assay to determine the
levels of copper in the blood, which is essential for diagnosing and
monitoring various health conditions, including Wilson's disease and
copper deficiency.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Requirements and Preparation
1. Specimen Type:
◦ Serum samples are required for copper measurement.
2. Collection and Storage:
◦ Collect blood in a plain red-top or serum separator tube
(SST).
◦ Allow the blood to clot for 15-30 minutes and then centrifuge
to separate the serum.
◦ Transfer the serum into a clean, trace metal-free container
(e.g., polypropylene tubes).
◦ Store the serum samples at 2-8°C until analysis if tested
within 24 hours. For longer storage, freeze the samples at
-20°C or lower.
3. Unacceptable Specimens:
◦ Hemolyzed samples are not acceptable as hemolysis can
release intracellular copper, leading to falsely elevated
results.
◦ Samples with visible particulates unless centrifuged to
remove the particulates.
B. Equipment, Materials, and Reagents
1. Equipment:
◦ Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer (AAS) or Inductively
Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer (ICP-MS)
◦ Centrifuge
◦ Trace metal-free pipettes
◦ Vortex mixer
2. Reagents:
◦ Calibration standards for copper
◦ Quality control materials at various concentrations (low,
medium, high)
◦ Deionized water
◦ Reagent grade acids for instrument cleaning (e.g., nitric
acid)
◦ Mixed matrix modifiers (if using AAS with graphite furnace)
C. Analytical Procedure
1. Calibration:
◦ Prepare calibration standards as per the manufacturer's
instructions.
◦ Perform calibration of the AAS or ICP-MS using copper
standards ranging from 0 to 500 µg/dL.
◦ Calibration should be validated before analyzing patient
samples to ensure accuracy.
2. Sample Analysis:
◦ Vortex the serum samples to ensure homogeneity.
◦ Dilute the serum samples if necessary, based on the
expected copper concentration range.
◦ Load the samples, standards, and quality controls onto the
instrument following the standard operating procedure of the
equipment.
◦ Analyze the samples, ensuring that each run includes at
least two quality control samples (e.g., one low and one
high).
3. Quality Control:
◦ Run quality control samples at the beginning and end of
each batch and after every 20 patient samples.
◦ Assess the quality control results to ensure they fall within
the acceptable range.
◦ If the quality control results are outside the acceptable
range, troubleshoot the issue, recalibrate the instrument if
necessary, and reanalyze the samples.
D. Reporting Results
1. Data Review and Validation:
◦ Review the analysis data for any discrepancies or trends
that may indicate instrument malfunction or sample
contamination.
◦ Confirm that all quality controls are within the acceptable
range, and recalibrate if necessary.
◦ Validate the results in the Laboratory Information System
(LIS) by verifying their consistency with the calibration curve
and quality controls.
2. Result Reporting:
◦ Report the serum copper concentration in µg/dL.
◦ Include any relevant comments or flags for samples outside
the reference range or with procedural issues.
3. Reference Intervals:
◦ Normal reference range for copper in serum: 70-140 µg/dL
(may vary slightly depending on the laboratory's population
and instrumentation).
Method Limitations:
• Make note of any factors that could interfere with copper
measurement, including elevated bilirubin, hemolysis, or improper
sample handling.
• Ensure that any deviations from standard procedures are
documented and addressed immediately.
References:
• Manufacturer's instructions for AAS or ICP-MS for copper
measurement.
• Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines for
trace element analysis in biological samples.
This SOP is subject to review and revision as necessary to
accommodate technological advancements and organizational
changes. All changes must be authorized by the laboratory
supervisor.
