STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP) CORIANDER, IGE,
SERUM ANALYSIS
1. PURPOSE
To provide detailed procedures for the analysis of Coriander, IgE,
Serum to ensure accurate and reliable results.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
All designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the
procedures as outlined in this SOP. They must ensure that all steps
are accurately followed, and appropriate corrective actions are
documented and taken when necessary.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen:
• Preferred: 5 mL of serum collected in a red-top tube without
additives.
• Transport: Transport the specimen at 2-8°C.
• Stability:
◦ Refrigerated (2-8°C): Stable for up to 7 days.
◦ Frozen (-20°C or colder): Stable for up to 30 days.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens with hemolysis, lipemia, or icterus.
• Specimens received in non-approved containers.
• Specimens that are not properly labeled with the collection date/
time or patient identification.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Automated chemiluminescent immunoassay analyzer, such as
Siemens IMMULITE 2000.
• Assay kits: Specific IgE for Coriander, Siemens kit, or equivalent.
• Calibrators and controls: Provided by the reagent manufacturer.
• Standard laboratory glassware and pipettes.
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) – gloves, lab coats, and
safety glasses.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation:
1. Quality Control:
◦ Prepare and run QC material as per the manufacturer's
instructions.
◦ Log the results in the Quality Control Log.
◦ Ensure results are within acceptable limits before
proceeding with patient samples. If QC results are not within
acceptable limits, take corrective actions as per the
manufacturer’s guidelines and notify the supervisor.
2. Calibrations:
◦ Perform calibration using the provided calibrators according
to the manufacturer's instructions.
◦ Document calibration dates and results.
B. Specimen Processing:
1. Sample Preparation:
◦ Allow serum samples to reach room temperature (20-25°C)
before analysis.
◦ Mix samples gently before loading onto the analyzer to
avoid foam or bubbles.
2. Loading Samples:
◦ Load patient samples, calibrators, and QC materials onto
the analyzer.
◦ Ensure proper identification of samples, calibrators, and
controls using appropriate labels/barcodes.
C. Running the Assay:
1. Analysis:
◦ Run the assay as per the analyzer’s operating manual.
◦ Monitor the instrument for any errors or alarms during the
analysis.
2. Post-Analysis:
◦ Retrieve results from the analyzer.
◦ Verify that no system messages or error codes are
recorded.
◦ If unexpected results or errors are noted, repeat the analysis
or perform additional troubleshooting if necessary.
3. REPORTING RESULTS
4. Result Verification:
◦ Review and verify results for each patient.
◦ Ensure that the data is complete, and any anomalies are
addressed.
5. Critical Values:
◦ If results fall within critical ranges, follow the laboratory’s
critical result policy to notify the appropriate medical
personnel.
6. Logging:
◦ Enter verified results into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
◦ Document any corrective actions taken during analysis.
7. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• IgE, Coriander, Serum:
◦ Negative: <0.35 kUA/L
◦ Low Positive: 0.35-0.70 kUA/L
◦ Moderate Positive: 0.71-3.50 kUA/L
◦ High Positive: 3.51-17.50 kUA/L
◦ Very High Positive: >17.50 kUA/L
1. QUALITY CONTROL
2. Internal Quality Control:
◦ Perform QC testing at the beginning of each shift, with each
new assay lot, and whenever a significant change is made
to the analyzer or assay method.
◦ Document all QC results and corrective actions taken.
3. External Quality Assurance:
◦ Participate in external proficiency testing programs as
required.
◦ Review and document results from external proficiency
testing.
4. LIMITATIONS AND TROUBLESHOOTING
5. Method Limitations:
◦ Refer to the Siemens IMMULITE 2000 assay insert for
individual reagent limitations.
◦ Any factors that may interfere with assay results, such as
heterophilic antibodies, should be noted.
6. Troubleshooting:
◦ Follow the analyzer’s troubleshooting guide for common
issues.
◦ In case of persistent problems, consult the supervisor and
contact the analyzer’s technical support for assistance.
