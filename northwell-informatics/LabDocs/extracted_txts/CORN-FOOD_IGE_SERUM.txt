Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Corn-Food IgE, Serum
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedures for generating and validating results for
Corn-Food IgE levels in serum samples. This SOP ensures accurate
and reliable testing, which is essential for assessing potential allergic
reactions to corn in patients.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of laboratory technologists to follow this
procedure and perform all related tests according to the outlined
protocols. Supervisors are responsible for ensuring compliance and
addressing any issues that arise during testing.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred Specimen: 2-5 mL of serum collected in a red-top or
serum separator tube (SST).
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
• Serum samples collected in tubes containing anticoagulants.
• Specimens that have been improperly stored or transported.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) Reader/Analyzer
• Incubator
Reagents:
• IgE Standard Kit (specific for Corn-Food IgE)
• Wash buffer
• Substrate solution
• Stop solution
Supplies:
• Microtiter plates
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Timer
• Sample dilution tubes
5. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation
1. Allow serum samples to sit at room temperature for 20-30
minutes for complete clot formation.
2. Centrifuge the samples at 1500 g for 10 minutes to separate
serum from the clot.
3. Aliquot the serum into separate labeled tubes if necessary.
B. Assay Procedure
1. Dilution: Dilute patient serum samples as required by the
assay protocol.
2. Loading: Pipette the predetermined volume of standards,
controls, and diluted patient samples into designated wells on
the microtiter plate.
3. Incubation: Incubate the plate at 37°C for 60 minutes.
4. Washing: Wash plates 4 times with wash buffer.
5. Addition of Conjugate: Add enzyme conjugate to each well
and incubate at 37°C for another 60 minutes.
6. Washing: Repeat the washing step.
7. Substrate Addition: Add substrate solution to each well and
incubate in the dark at room temperature for 30 minutes.
8. Stopping Reaction: Add stop solution to each well.
9. Reading: Read absorbance at 450 nm using an ELISA reader
within 15 minutes of stopping the reaction.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Internal Quality Control: Run positive and negative controls with
each assay to ensure the reliability of results.
• External Quality Control: Participate in inter-laboratory quality
assurance programs regularly.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results are reviewed for accuracy and consistency before being
entered into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Results are reported as kU/L indicating the level of specific IgE
present.
• Reference intervals:
◦ < 0.35 kU/L: Negative (no sensitization)
◦ 0.35-0.70 kU/L: Low level sensitization
◦ 0.71-3.50 kU/L: Moderate level sensitization
◦ 3.51-17.5 kU/L: High level sensitization
◦ 17.5 kU/L: Very high level sensitization
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the Corn-Food IgE kit insert for individual method limitations
and performance characteristics. Common limitations include cross-
reactivity with other allergens and interference from high total IgE
levels.
