Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Measurement of Corn IgG
Antibodies
1. PURPOSE: To outline the procedure for the measurement of Corn
IgG antibodies in human serum/plasma samples using the enzyme-
linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method. This protocol ensures
accurate, reliable, and reproducible results.
2. SCOPE: This procedure applies to all staff members performing
the Corn IgG antibody test in the laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY: Laboratory personnel are responsible for
conducting the assay as per the procedure. Supervisors are
responsible for ensuring adherence to the protocol and addressing
any issues that arise.
4. DEFINITIONS: Corn IgG antibodies: Immunoglobulin G (IgG)
antibodies specific to corn proteins, typically measured to assess
potential food sensitivities or allergic responses.
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS:
• Preferred specimen: Serum separated from clotted venous blood.
• Acceptable specimen: Plasma collected in EDTA or heparin tubes.
• Volume required: Minimum of 0.5 mL.
• Specimen stability: Serum/plasma samples are stable for up to 7
days at 2-8°C. For long-term storage, freeze specimens at -20°C
or below.
6. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS:
• ELISA reader with appropriate software.
• Incubator set at 37°C.
• Precision pipettes and tips.
• Microplate washer.
• Vortex mixer.
• Centrifuge.
• Calibrated thermometer.
• Corn IgG ELISA kit, including:
◦ ELISA microplate coated with Corn antigens.
◦ Calibrators/standards.
◦ Positive and negative controls.
◦ Wash buffer.
◦ TMB substrate.
◦ Stop solution.
◦ Sample diluent.
7. PROCEDURE:
7.1 Preparation:
1. Bring all reagents, samples, and controls to room temperature
before starting the assay.
2. Prepare wash buffer and other kit components as per
manufacturer’s instructions.
3. Label and arrange all required wells on the ELISA plate for
standards, controls, and samples.
7.2 Sample Preparation:
1. Centrifuge serum/plasma samples at 1,500x g for 10 minutes to
remove any particulate matter.
2. Dilute samples 1:100 with sample diluent (e.g., add 10 µL of
sample to 990 µL of diluent).
7.3 Assay Procedure:
1. Add 100 µL of standards, controls, and diluted samples to
respective wells in the ELISA plate.
2. Incubate the plate at 37°C for 1 hour.
3. Wash the plate 5 times with the prepared wash buffer using the
microplate washer.
4. Add 100 µL of enzyme-conjugated secondary antibody to each
well.
5. Incubate the plate at 37°C for 1 hour.
6. Wash the plate 5 times with the prepared wash buffer.
7. Add 100 µL of TMB substrate to each well.
8. Incubate the plate at room temperature (20-25°C) for 10-15
minutes in the dark.
9. Add 50 µL of stop solution to each well to stop the reaction.
7.4 Measurement:
1. Measure the absorbance at 450 nm using an ELISA reader
within 30 minutes of adding the stop solution.
8. CALCULATION AND INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS:
1. Generate a standard curve by plotting the absorbance of
standards against their known concentrations.
2. Calculate the concentration of Corn IgG antibodies in samples
using the standard curve.
3. Report results in µg/mL or as specified by the laboratory’s
reporting guidelines.
9. QUALITY CONTROL:
1. Include positive and negative controls with each assay run.
2. Acceptable control ranges must be established and adhered to.
3. Reject runs where controls fall outside the acceptable range
and troubleshoot as needed.
10. REPORTING RESULTS:
1. Verify and review all data before entering results into the
laboratory information system (LIS).
2. Report results following site-specific guidelines.
11. REFERENCE INTERVALS: <7.5 µg/mL: Negative 7.5 – 15 µg/
mL: Borderline
15 µg/mL: Positive
12. METHOD LIMITATIONS: Refer to the manufacturer’s ELISA kit
insert for specific limitations regarding interferences and cross-
reactivities.
13. REFERENCES:
• Manufacturer's Instructions for Use (IFU) provided with the Corn
IgG ELISA kit.
• Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines for
ELISA testing.
14. DOCUMENTATION: Record all data, including quality control
results and any deviations from the procedure, in the appropriate
logs.
Ensure all laboratory staff are trained on this SOP and it is followed
consistently to maintain the accuracy and reliability of test results.
