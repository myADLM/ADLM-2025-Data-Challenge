Protocol for the Analytical Phase of Generating Results for CORN
IGG4
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this protocol is to outline the steps involved in the
analytical phase of generating results for CORN IGG4, ensuring
accurate, repeatable, and precise results.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Preferred Specimen:
• 5 mL serum or plasma collected in a gold-top serum separator
tube (SST) or a green-top heparinized tube.
• Specimen should be centrifuged within 2 hours of collection and
serum/plasma separated from cells.
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Specimens that are hemolyzed or lipemic.
• Specimens collected in tubes containing anticoagulants such as
EDTA or citrate.
• Specimens that have been exposed to extreme temperatures
(below 2°C or above 37°C) during collection, transport, or storage.
Stability:
• Serum/plasma stable for up to 7 days at 2-8°C.
• For long-term storage, serum/plasma should be frozen at -20°C or
lower and is stable for up to 3 months.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• CORN IGG4 assay kit (manufacturer-specific)
• Refrigerated centrifuge
• Pipettes and micropipettes
• Laboratory freezer (-20°C or lower) and refrigerator (2-8°C)
• Laboratory timer
• Nitrile or latex gloves
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
• Calibrated laboratory balance
1. PROCEDURE
4.1 Preparation:
• Ensure all reagents, calibrators, and control materials are at room
temperature before starting the assay.
• Verify the expiration date and integrity of the CORN IGG4 assay
kit reagents.
• Set up and calibrate the automated immunoassay analyzer
according to the manufacturer's instructions.
4.2 Specimen Processing:
• Retrieve specimen from storage and allow it to come to room
temperature.
• Inspect the specimen for signs of hemolysis or lipemia. If
unacceptable, discard and request a new specimen.
• Aliquot the required volume of serum/plasma for the assay.
4.3 Assay Protocol:
• Load the serum/plasma aliquot, calibrators, and controls onto the
automated immunoassay analyzer.
• Follow the specific instructions provided by the assay kit
manufacturer. This typically involves:
◦ Adding the serum/plasma to the assay wells
◦ Incubating the specimen at a controlled temperature for a
specified time
◦ Adding detection reagents
◦ Washing to remove unbound substances
◦ Reading absorbance or fluorescence using the analyzer
4.4 Result Interpretation:
• The automated immunoassay analyzer will generate quantitative
results for CORN IGG4.
• Review instrument-generated results for any flags or warnings;
consider re-testing flagged specimens.
4.5 Quality Control:
• Run at least two levels of quality control material with each assay
batch.
• Ensure that control results are within the established acceptance
criteria before verifying specimen results.
• Document any corrective actions taken if quality control results
are outside acceptance limits.
1. RESULT REPORTING
• Confirm results are accurately transmitted to the Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
• Verify results and review for clinical significance.
• Report critically abnormal results immediately according to the
lab's critical result reporting policy.
• Document any issues or unusual observations in the laboratory
log.

1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Cross-reactivity with other immunoglobulins must be evaluated;
refer to specific assay limitations in the manufacturer's insert.
• High levels of hemoglobin, bilirubin, or lipids may interfere with
assay results.
• Results should be interpreted in conjunction with clinical findings
and other diagnostic procedures.
This protocol outlines the steps for the analytical phase of generating
CORN IGG4 results. These procedures ensure the reliability and
accuracy of test results, aiding in the effective monitoring and
diagnosis of relevant conditions.
