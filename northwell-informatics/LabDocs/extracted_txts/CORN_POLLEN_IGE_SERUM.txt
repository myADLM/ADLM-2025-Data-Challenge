Standard Operating Procedure for the Analytical Phase of Generating
Results for Corn Pollen, IgE, Serum
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for analyzing serum samples for corn pollen-
specific IgE using an immunoassay method. This protocol ensures
the accuracy, reliability, and standardization of the results reported.
Responsibility:
Laboratory technologists or designated qualified personnel are
responsible for adhering to this protocol and performing the analysis
accurately. Supervisors are responsible for ensuring compliance with
this SOP and addressing any issues or deviations.
1. DEFINITION
Corn Pollen, IgE, Serum refers to the measurement of
immunoglobulin E specific to corn pollen allergens in a patient's
serum. Elevated levels of specific IgE antibodies indicate
sensitization and possible allergic reaction to corn pollen.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Immunoassay Analyzer (e.g., ImmunoCAP, ELISA)
• Corn Pollen-specific IgE test kits
• Calibrators and controls (Negative and Positive)
• Serum separators or centrifuge
• Micropipettes and tips
• Reagent reservoirs
• Test tubes or sample cups
• Laboratory Timer
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Preferred Specimen:
• Serum collected in a serum separator tube (SST)
• Minimum volume: 0.5mL of serum
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric specimens may interfere with the
assay and should be avoided.
• Specimens collected in anticoagulant tubes other than SSTs.
Stability:
• Serum samples are stable for up to 48 hours when stored at
2-8°C.
• For longer storage, serum samples should be frozen at -20°C and
are stable for up to 1 year.
1. PROCEDURE
5.1 Sample Preparation
1. Allow serum samples to reach room temperature before
analysis.
2. Mix the sample gently by inversion.
3. Aliquot the serum into appropriately labeled test tubes or
sample cups.
5.2 Calibration and Quality Control
1. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for calibrating the
immunoassay analyzer.
2. Run quality control (QC) samples at both negative and positive
levels prior to patient sample analysis.
3. Document QC results and ensure they fall within acceptable
ranges before proceeding. If QC results are out of range,
troubleshoot and resolve issues before analysis.
5.3 Sample Analysis
1. Place calibrators, controls, and patient samples in the
designated positions on the immunoassay analyzer.
2. Load the corn pollen-specific IgE test kit reagents according to
the manufacturer's instructions.
3. Input necessary patient information into the analyzer software.
4. Start the assay run and monitor for any errors or alerts during
the run.
5. Once the run is completed, review the results for all samples.
5.4 Result Interpretation
1. Reference Intervals:
◦ Refer to the test kit insert for specific reference ranges and
cutoff values for corn pollen-specific IgE.
2. Interpret the results based on the reference intervals provided
in the kit insert.
3. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Review and verify the results. Ensure that QC results are
within acceptable ranges.
2. Enter the verified results into the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
3. Report results in accordance with site-specific reporting
guidelines, including any critical notification policies.
4. QUALITY CONTROL AND MAINTENANCE
7.1 Internal Quality Control
• Perform reagent verification and lot-to-lot comparison for each
new reagent batch.
• Maintain records of calibration, QC results, and maintenance
activities.
7.2 Maintenance
• Perform routine maintenance of the immunoassay analyzer as per
the manufacturer's instructions.
• Document all maintenance activities and any corrective actions
taken.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
8.1 Interferences
• High levels of biotin, hemoglobin, bilirubin, and lipids in serum
samples may interfere with the assay and should be evaluated for
potential impact on results.
8.2 Cross-reactivity
• Cross-reactivity with other allergens may occur. Confirm result-
specific IgE levels correspond with the clinical history of allergy to
corn pollen.

2. DOCUMENTATION
• Ensure all procedures, calibration, QC, maintenance records, and
patient results are documented and stored as per laboratory
policies.
This SOP is to be reviewed periodically and updated as necessary to
reflect any changes in procedures, equipment, or regulatory
requirements.
