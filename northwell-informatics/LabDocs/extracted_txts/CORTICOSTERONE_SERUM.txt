CORTICOSTERONE, SERUM ANALYSIS PROTOCOL
1. PURPOSE
To establish a standardized procedure for the analysis of serum
corticosteroid levels in samples received by the laboratory, ensuring
high accuracy, precision, and minimal variability between assays.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
Laboratory technicians and technologists are responsible for
following the protocol meticulously to ensure the reliable generation
of serum corticosteroid levels. Supervisors are responsible for the
oversight of the assay procedures and the resolution of any issues
that arise during the analytical process.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred Specimen: Serum collected in red-top tube (no
anticoagulant).
• Acceptable Specimen: Serum collected in serum separator tube
(SST).
• Unacceptable Specimen: Specimens collected in tubes with
anticoagulants (EDTA, heparin, citrate), hemolyzed specimens.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Centrifuge
• Refrigerated sample storage unit
• Corticosterone enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit
• Micropipettes and tips
• Microplate reader
• Vortex mixer
• Timer
• Appropriate PPE (lab coat, gloves, etc.)
5. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation
1. Serum Collection: Allow blood to clot for 30-60 minutes at room
temperature before centrifugation.
2. Centrifugation: Centrifuge for 10 minutes at 1000-1500 x g.
Carefully transfer the serum into labeled storage vials.
3. Storage: Store serum samples at 2-8°C for short-term or at
-20°C for longer periods until analysis.
B. ELISA Kit Preparation
1. Follow manufacturer’s instructions for preparation of reagents
and standards.
2. Ensure that all reagents are brought to room temperature
before use.
3. Label microplate wells appropriately.
C. Assay Procedure
1. Standard Addition: Prepare corticosteroid standards as per the
kit instructions. Add 50 µL of standards to assigned wells.
2. Sample Addition: Add 50 µL of serum samples to assigned
wells.
3. Incubate: Incubate microplate at room temperature for the
specified duration as per kit instructions.
4. Wash: Wash the wells as per the kit instructions using the
provided wash buffer.
5. Substrate Addition: Add the substrate solution to the wells and
incubate for the specified duration.
6. Stop Reaction: Add the stop solution as specified in the kit
instructions.
7. Reading: Read the optical density using a microplate reader at
the specified wavelength.
D. Result Calculation
1. Construct a standard curve by plotting the optical density (O.D.)
versus the concentration of standards.
2. Determine the corticosteroid concentrations in samples from
the standard curve.
3. Use the software provided with the microplate reader to
calculate the concentrations more precisely.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Run standards and controls with each batch of assay to monitor
assay performance.
2. If QC results fall outside of acceptable limits, troubleshoot per
kit instructions and document corrective actions.
3. Record all QC results in the QC log.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Verify concentrations of corticosteroid in serum samples using
established laboratory protocols.
2. Record final concentrations in the laboratory information system
(LIS).
3. Flag critical values and notify appropriate personnel as per
laboratory policy.
