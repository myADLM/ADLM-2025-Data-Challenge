Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analysis
of Free Cortisol and Cortisone in 24-Hour Urine
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is to
outline the procedure for the determination of free cortisol and
cortisone levels in a 24-hour urine sample. This includes the
handling, preparation, and analysis of the sample.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel involved in the
preparation, handling, and analysis of urine samples collected for the
measurement of free cortisol and cortisone.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Designated Staff: Responsible for carrying out the analysis as
outlined in this SOP.
• Supervisors: Ensure that staff are properly trained and that the
SOP is followed. Address any issues related to sample
preparation, analysis, and result verification.
4. SPECIMEN
• Type: 24-hour urine collection
• Volume: Preferably the entire 24-hour collection. Record total
urine volume before aliquoting for testing.
• Storage and Stability: Store at 2-8°C if analysis will be
performed within 5 days. For extended storage, freeze samples at
-20°C or lower.
5. MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT
• High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) system or
Liquid Chromatography linked with Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/
MS)
• Urine collection containers
• Graduated cylinder for measuring urine volume
• Centrifuge
• Sample vials
• Internal Standard solution (if applicable)
• Mobile phase solvents
• Calibration standards and quality control samples
• Pipettes and tips
• Gloves and other appropriate PPE
6. REAGENTS
• HPLC-grade water, acetonitrile, methanol, and other solvents
required for mobile phase preparation
• Calibration standards and quality control samples
• Internal standard solution
• Any required derivatizing agents (if applicable)
7. PROCEDURE
Sample Preparation:
1. Mix the 24-hour urine collection thoroughly.
2. Measure and record the total urine volume.
3. Aliquot a portion (e.g., 5-10 mL) into a labeled centrifuge tube
for analysis.
4. Centrifuge the aliquot at 2,000-3,000 rpm for 10 minutes to
remove particulates.
5. Transfer the supernatant into a clean, labeled sample vial.
6. If applicable, add internal standard solution to each sample,
calibrator, and quality control sample.
Calibration and Quality Control:
1. Prepare calibration standards across the desired concentration
range in urine matrix.
2. Prepare quality control samples at low, mid, and high
concentrations within the calibration range.
3. Fortify each standard and quality control sample with the
internal standard, if used.
Instrument Setup and Analysis:
1. Set up the HPLC or LC-MS/MS system according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
2. Prepare the mobile phase and set up the solvents for the
gradient program.
3. Load the sequence table with calibration standards, quality
control samples, and urine samples.
4. Perform a system suitability test to ensure system performance.
5. Inject calibration standards, followed by quality control samples,
and then urine samples.
Data Analysis:
1. Review and ensure proper chromatographic separation and
peak identification for cortisol and cortisone.
2. Integrate peaks and calculate the concentrations using the
calibration curve.
3. Ensure quality control samples are within acceptable ranges
before releasing sample results.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Ensure calibration standards and quality control samples are
prepared freshly for each analysis batch.
2. Run at least two levels of quality control samples with each
batch of unknowns.
3. Review quality control results to ensure they are within defined
acceptable ranges.
4. If quality control results are out of range, troubleshoot and
resolve issues before analyzing unknown samples.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Report results in the designated Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
2. Calculate the final concentration of free cortisol and cortisone in
μg/24 hours, considering total urine volume.
3. Ensure results are reviewed and verified by a designated
technologist or supervisor before final release.
10. REFERENCE RANGES
Refer to specific laboratory reference ranges for cortisol and
cortisone in 24-hour urine collections.
11. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Ensure proper sample mixing for accurate concentration
representation.
• Be aware of potential interferences and matrix effects. Refer to
instrument and method-specific documentation for detailed
limitations.
