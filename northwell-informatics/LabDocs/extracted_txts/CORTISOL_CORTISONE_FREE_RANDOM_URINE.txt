Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Cortisol/Cortisone, Free, Random, Urine
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to outline the steps required for the
analytical phase of generating cortisol/cortisone results from random
urine specimens. This includes the analysis, documentation, and
validation steps necessary to ensure that accurate and reliable test
results are delivered in a timely manner.
Responsibility: All laboratory staff who are trained and competent in
the procedures outlined in this SOP are responsible for the
processing and analysis of urine specimens for cortisol/cortisone
levels. Supervisors are responsible for ensuring that staff are properly
trained and that the SOP is followed.
1. DEFINITIONS
• Cortisol: A steroid hormone produced by the adrenal gland,
involved in the response to stress and metabolism.
• Cortisone: A corticosteroid hormone produced by the adrenal
gland, often converted from cortisol and involved in various
metabolic processes.
• Free Cortisol/Cortisone: The fraction of cortisol and cortisone not
bound to proteins and available for use by the body.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
• Specimen Type: Random urine
• Volume: Minimum volume of 10 mL
• Collection Requirements: Collect urine sample in a clean and dry
container. Store specimen refrigerated if not analyzed
immediately.
• Specimen Stability: Specimens are stable for up to 72 hours at
2-8°C. If storage exceeds 72 hours, freeze at -20°C for up to one
month.
Unacceptable Conditions:
• Specimens with significant contamination
• Specimens that have been improperly stored or handled
• Specimens with insufficient volume
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) or Liquid
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)
analyzer
• Reagents: Cortisol and cortisone standards, internal standards,
quality control materials
• Supplies: Pipettes, centrifuge, specimen vials, calibration and
control solutions
1. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Preparation
• Ensure urine specimens are well mixed prior to aliquoting.
• Aliquot 2 mL of random urine into a labeled centrifuge vial.
• Centrifuge specimens at 3000 RPM for 10 minutes to remove any
particulate matter.
• Transfer the supernatant to a new labeled vial for analysis.
B. Calibration and Quality Control
• Prepare calibration standards and quality control samples
according to manufacturer’s instructions.
• Ensure all standards and quality controls cover the expected
range of cortisol/cortisone concentrations.
• Perform calibration verification steps as outlined in the instrument
manual.
C. Sample Analysis using HPLC or LC-MS/MS
• Load calibration standards, quality control samples, and prepared
specimens into the autosampler.
• Set up the HPLC/LC-MS/MS system according to the operational
manual, ensuring all parameters (e.g., mobile phases, flow rate,
column temperature) are correctly configured.
• Run the analysis sequence, including standards, quality controls,
and specimens.
• Monitor the system for any errors or anomalies during the
analysis.
D. Review and Validation of Results
• Verify that calibration and quality control results are within
acceptable limits before reviewing patient results.
• Review chromatograms and corresponding data for each
specimen, ensuring peak integration accuracy.
• Validate results according to laboratory criteria and flag abnormal
or critical results.
• Document all steps and any deviations from the procedure in the
laboratory information system (LIS).
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results are automatically transmitted to the LIS from the HPLC/
LC-MS/MS system.
• Technologists must review and verify the data before final reports
are released.
• Report cortisol/cortisone levels in the specified units (usually ng/
mL or µg/mL).
• For any specimens with significant abnormalities or critical results,
notify the requesting physician immediately following laboratory
policy.
1. QUALITY CONTROL AND MAINTENANCE
• Perform regular maintenance on the analytical instrumentation as
per the manufacturer’s instructions.
• Conduct routine quality control tests bi-weekly using internal QC
materials and document the results.
• Participate in external proficiency testing as required by regulatory
bodies or accreditors.
• Keep complete and accurate records of all quality control and
maintenance activities.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• High levels of other steroids or certain medications may interfere
with the accurate measurement of cortisol/cortisone.
• Ensure that specimens are free from hemolysis or contamination,
as these factors can affect the analysis.
