Standard Operating Procedure: Analytical Phase for Generating
Results for CORTISOL, FREE, 24 HOUR, URINE
1. PURPOSE
This procedure outlines the analytical steps required to generate
accurate and reliable results for cortisol, free, 24 hour urine
specimens. This SOP ensures that all processes are conducted
consistently and in compliance with CLIA standards.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel performing the analytical
phase for cortisol, free, 24 hour urine tests in the CLIA-certified
laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for carrying out
the analytical procedures as outlined in this SOP.
• Supervisors are responsible for reviewing and approving the
results, as well as ensuring that all procedures are followed
correctly.
4. DEFINITIONS
• Cortisol, Free: The unbound fraction of cortisol present in the
urine, which represents the biologically active portion.
• 24-Hour Urine Collection: A urine sample collected over a
continuous 24-hour period to assess cortisol levels.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Equipment:
◦ Centrifuge
◦ Pipettes and tips
◦ Analytical balance
◦ Urine specimen container (24-hour)
◦ Automated chemiluminescence immunoassay analyzer or
liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/
MS) for cortisol measurement
• Reagents:
◦ Calibration standards for cortisol
◦ Quality control materials (low, medium, and high cortisol
levels)
◦ Extraction solvents (if required for LC-MS/MS)
◦ Reagent kits and consumables specific to the chosen
analytical method (e.g., chemiluminescence immunoassay kit)
• Supplies:
◦ Urine specimen cups
◦ Labels
◦ Documentation forms (e.g., temperature logs, QC logs)
6. PROCEDURE
A) Sample Preparation
1. Log Specimen:
◦ Verify that the 24-hour urine collection is properly labeled
with the patient’s information, collection start and end times.
2. Measure Total Volume:
◦ Measure and record the total volume of the 24-hour urine
specimen.
3. Mix Specimen:
◦ Mix the specimen thoroughly to ensure homogeneity before
aliquoting.
4. Aliquot Sample:
◦ Pipette a required volume (as specified by the chosen
analytical method) into a labeled sample tube for analysis.
◦ Store the remaining specimen appropriately (e.g.,
refrigerated at 2-8°C).
B) Analytical Measurement
1. Calibrate Instrument:
◦ Follow the instrument-specific SOP for calibration using
provided cortisol standards.
2. Perform Quality Control (QC):
◦ Run low, medium, and high-quality control samples to
ensure accuracy and precision.
◦ Document the QC results and confirm they are within
acceptable ranges before proceeding with patient samples.
3. Analyze Specimen:
◦ Load the sample into the analyzer following instrument-
specific guidelines.
◦ Document the run details including sample ID, date, time,
and technologist initials.
4. Interpret Results:
◦ Review the raw data output from the analyzer.
◦ Ensure that the results fall within the instrument’s reportable
range.
C) Result Validation
1. Review Analytical Data:
◦ Cross-check the QC results and patient data for any
anomalies or outliers.
◦ If QC results are not within the acceptable range,
troubleshoot and rerun the QC and patient samples as
necessary.
2. Document Results:
◦ Enter the patient’s cortisol value into the Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
◦ Report the cortisol level corrected for the total volume of the
24-hour urine collection if necessary.
3. Finalize Report:
◦ Review and verify the final report before releasing it to the
healthcare provider.
◦ Ensure all documentation is complete and accurate.
7. QUALITY CONTROL AND ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
• QC Material:
◦ Use standardized quality control materials and maintain them
according to the manufacturer’s guidelines.
◦ QC should be run at the beginning of each analytical batch,
after instrument maintenance, and calibration, and in case of
any observed deviations.
• Acceptance Criteria:
◦ QC results must be within predefined acceptable limits. Patient
results can only be reported if QC results are within the
acceptable range.
8. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS
• Follow biosafety protocols when handling biological specimens.
• Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) including
lab coat, gloves, and eye protection.
• Dispose of biohazardous materials and sharps in designated
containers following laboratory safety guidelines.
9. REFERENCES AND DOCUMENTATION
• Reference the cortisol assay package insert for specific reagent
and procedural guidance.
• Maintain all records of calibration, QC, and patient results as per
CLIA regulations.
• Follow specific insert or manufacturer’s guide for
chemiluminescence immunoassay or LC-MS/MS methodology.
10. REVISION HISTORY
• Document any changes or updates to the procedure, including the
date of revision and summary of changes.
Example Reference Interval:
• Normal adult urine cortisol: Refer to the specific analytical
method's reference range provided by the assay manufacturer.
