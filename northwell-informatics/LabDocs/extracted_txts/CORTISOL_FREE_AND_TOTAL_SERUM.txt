Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase:
Analysis of Cortisol, Free and Total, Serum
1. PURPOSE
To provide standardized procedures and guidelines for the
analysis of Free and Total Cortisol levels in serum samples to
ensure accuracy, reliability, and consistency of results.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel involved in
analyzing Cortisol, Free and Total, in serum samples using the
designated analytical instrument.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
◦ Laboratory personnel are responsible for following this
procedure.
◦ Supervisors are responsible for ensuring compliance with
the protocol and addressing any discrepancies or issues
that arise.
4. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
◦ Centrifuge
◦ Refrigerated storage unit
◦ Analytical instrument for cortisol measurement (e.g.,
Immunoassay Analyzer)
◦ Pipettes and pipette tips
◦ Sample tubes (serum separator tubes)
◦ Cortisol standards and control materials
◦ Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) (e.g., gloves, lab coat,
eye protection)
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
◦ Preferred specimen: Serum collected in SST tubes.
◦ Serum should be separated from cells within 2 hours of
collection.
◦ Specimen Stability: Store separated serum at 2-8°C for up
to 7 days. For long-term storage, freeze at -20°C or lower.
Unacceptable Specimens:
◦ Hemolyzed samples
◦ Specimens collected in inappropriate containers
◦ Serum samples that are not separated from the clot within
the specified time frame
6. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Use quality control (QC) materials containing known
concentrations of cortisol.
◦ QC materials should span low, medium, and high levels
relevant to the assay range.
◦ Analyze QC materials at the beginning of the run, after
every 20 patient samples, and at the end of each analytical
batch.
◦ Record and review QC results. The assay is acceptable if
QC results fall within the predefined acceptable range. If QC
fails, investigate and resolve before proceeding with patient
samples.
◦ Follow manufacturer's guidelines for instrument calibration
and maintenance.
7. PROCEDURE
a. Preparation
◦ Wear appropriate PPE before handling samples.
◦ Allow frozen specimens and QC materials to reach room
temperature before analysis.
◦ Mix thoroughly by gentle inversion.
b. Sample Analysis
◦ Load serum samples, standards, and QC materials onto the
instrument as per the manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Follow the instrument operating procedure for running the
Cortisol assay.
◦ Ensure that the instrument settings, calibration, and
maintenance meet the assay requirements.
c. Results Recording and Reporting
◦ Review the results generated by the analyzer.
◦ Validate results by ensuring that the QC results fall within
acceptable limits.
◦ Record results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
◦ Flag and recheck any results that are above or below the
expected range.
◦ Report confirmed results according to site-specific reporting
guidelines.
8. TROUBLESHOOTING
◦ Instrument Error: Follow the manufacturer's guide to
resolve instrument errors. If unresolved, contact technical
support.
◦ QC Out of Range: Repeat the QC. If still out of range,
recalibrate the instrument, re-run QC, and reanalyze patient
samples.
◦ Suspected Sample Issues: If hemolysis is suspected or
results are inconsistent, request a repeat sample.
9. REFERENCES
◦ Manufacturer's Instructions for Use (IFU) for the analytical
platform.
◦ Relevant Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI)
guidelines.
◦ Peer-reviewed literature and updates on cortisol assay
methodologies.
