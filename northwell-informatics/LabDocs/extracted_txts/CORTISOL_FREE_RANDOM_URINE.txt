Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Measurement of
Free Cortisol in Random Urine
1. PURPOSE
This SOP provides step-by-step instructions for the measurement of
free cortisol in random urine samples. This ensures accuracy,
precision, and consistency in results and compliance with regulatory
standards.
Responsibility
It is the responsibility of qualified laboratory personnel to carry out
and document the procedures outlined in this SOP. The laboratory
supervisor should ensure adherence to the protocol and address any
deviations or issues.
1. DEFINITIONS
Free cortisol (hydrocortisone) refers to the fraction of cortisol not
bound to cortisol-binding globulin (CBG) or albumin, and excreted in
the urine.
Random urine collection refers to a urine specimen collected at a
random time, without any time-based or fasting requirements.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
• Specimen Type: Random urine.
• Specimen Volume: Minimum of 10 mL.
• Collection Container: Use a sterile, leak-proof container.
• Stability: Store at 2-8°C for up to 48 hours. For longer storage,
freeze at -20°C or colder.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens with visible contamination or particulates.
• Specimens with insufficient volume.
• Specimens not properly labelled.
• Specimens exceeding the stability criteria.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Automated immunoassay analyzer (e.g., Roche Cobas, Siemens
Centaur)
• Cortisol assay reagent kit
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Reagent grade water
• Quality control materials (Negative and Positive controls)
• Centrifuge
• Standard laboratory glassware
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform quality control at the beginning and end of each assay
run, and whenever a new reagent lot is introduced.
• Use two levels of controls (Negative and Positive).
• Follow the manufacturer's guidelines for storage and handling of
control materials.
• Document QC results. If controls fall outside the acceptable
ranges, investigate and resolve the issue before proceeding with
patient samples.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation:
1. Mix Specimen: Thoroughly mix the urine specimen by gently
inverting the container.
2. Centrifuge Sample (if necessary): Centrifuge at 3000 RPM for
10 minutes to remove any particulate matter.
3. Aliquot Sample: Pipet the required volume of urine into a test
tube, label with the patient identifier.
B. Assay Procedure:
1. Instrument Setup:
◦ Turn on the immunoassay analyzer and perform any routine
startup procedures.
◦ Ensure the instrument has been calibrated and the
calibration is valid.
2. Reagent Preparation:
◦ Prepare the assay reagents according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
3. Loading Samples:
◦ Load the urine samples, calibrators, and QC materials onto
the analyzer, as per the randomization protocol.
4. Running the Assay:
◦ Initiate the run according to the analyzer’s operational
protocol.
◦ Ensure that all sample identifiers match the corresponding
samples on the analyzer.
C. Result Verification and Reporting:
1. Review Results:
◦ After the run, review all patient and QC results for
acceptability.
◦ Perform manual verification of results flagged by the
analyzer.
2. Result Interpretation:
◦ Compare patient results to reference intervals.
◦ Results should include the concentration of free cortisol in
the urine, typically expressed in μg/dL or nmol/L.
3. Documentation and Reporting:
◦ Document results in the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
◦ Ensure that any critical or abnormal results are promptly
communicated to the requesting clinician according to
laboratory protocols.
4. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Reference intervals may vary by population and must be verified/
validated for each laboratory’s patient demographic. Refer to the
manufacturer's package insert or peer-reviewed guidelines to
determine the reference range.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Factors such as hemolysis, lipemia, or improper storage may
affect the accuracy of results.
• Cross-reactivity with structurally similar substances may occur.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING
• Consult the analyzer's troubleshooting guide or the reagent kit
insert for specific issues.
• Document any issues and corrective actions taken in the
instrument’s maintenance log.

This concludes the SOP for the analytical phase of measuring free
cortisol in random urine. Follow all safety and quality guidelines to
ensure accurate and reliable results.
