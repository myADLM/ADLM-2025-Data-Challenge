Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Cortisol, Free, Serum
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedures for the accurate and consistent analysis of
free serum cortisol levels in patients' samples. This SOP will provide
detailed instructions on specimen preparation, equipment use, and
result reporting to ensure compliance with CLIA guidelines.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of all trained laboratory personnel to follow this
SOP for free serum cortisol analysis. Any deviations or issues
encountered during the process should be reported to a supervisor
immediately.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/Acceptable Specimen:
• Serum collected in a red-top or gold-top tube.
• Specimen should be centrifuged and the serum should be
separated within 2 hours of collection.
• Ideal volume: 1-2 mL of serum.
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Hemolyzed samples.
• Serum not separated and frozen within 2 hours of collection.
• Specimens with no collection date/time indicated on the sample
container or requisition.
Specimen Stability:
• Room temperature: 6 hours.
• Refrigerated (2-8°C): Up to 7 days.
• Frozen (-20°C): Up to 1 month.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• Centrifuge
• Free Cortisol ELISA or RIA kit (approved by the FDA)
• Microplate reader (ELISA) or gamma counter (RIA)
• Pipettes and tips
• Disposable test tubes
• Timer
• Personal protective equipment (PPE) including lab coat, gloves,
and safety goggles
4. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Ensure the microplate reader or gamma counter is calibrated
according to manufacturer instructions.
2. Verify that all reagents are at room temperature before use.
3. Wear appropriate PPE before handling specimens and
reagents.
Sample Preparation:
1. Centrifuge the blood sample at 3,000 rpm for 10 minutes to
separate the serum.
2. Transfer the supernatant serum into a clean, properly labeled
test tube.
3. If not immediately analyzed, store the serum sample at 2-8°C or
freeze at -20°C.
Assay Procedure:
1. Follow the specific kit instructions (ELISA or RIA) for the assay
processing. Ensure all reagents and samples are brought to
room temperature.
2. Pipette the serum sample and standards into the appropriate
wells or tubes.
3. Add the assay buffer and incubate as per the kit-specific
instructions.
4. Wash the wells/tubes as directed.
5. Add substrate solution and allow for color development (ELISA)
or radioactivity measurement (RIA).
6. Measure absorbance using the microplate reader (ELISA) or
count radioactivity using the gamma counter (RIA).
Quality Control:
1. Run two levels of control serum (low and high) with each batch
of tests.
2. If controls fall outside of the acceptable range, troubleshoot
according to kit instructions and repeat the assay if necessary.
5. RESULT REPORTING
1. Record the absorbance readings or radioactivity counts.
2. Calculate the cortisol concentration in the serum based on the
standard curve generated.
3. Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS) for
review and verification by a technologist.
4. Verify sample integrity before approving results. Any
discrepancies or issues must be reported to the supervisor.
Reference Intervals:
• Free Cortisol: Typically, 3.7-9.4 ng/dL in serum (may vary based
on the assay kit).
Method Limitations: Refer to the ELISA or RIA kit insert for
limitations, such as interference from high lipids or potential cross-
reactivity with corticosteroid medications.

calibration and QC procedures.
Ensure that all procedures in this SOP are thoroughly understood
and correctly implemented by all laboratory personnel. Regular
review and updates of this SOP may be necessary to incorporate any
changes in guidelines or equipment.
