Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase: Cortisol
Testing in Serum
1. PURPOSE
To provide accurate and reliable measurement of cortisol levels in
serum samples using standardized analytical procedures.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the
analysis following the SOP.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring adherence to the SOP
and addressing any deviations that may affect test results.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Preferred Specimen:
• Serum obtained from a venous blood draw collected in a serum
separator tube (SST).
• Allow the blood to clot for 30 minutes at room temperature before
centrifugation.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed samples.
• Specimens not properly labeled with patient identification.
• Specimen volumes less than the required minimum (1 mL serum).
Specimen Stability:
• Room temperature: Up to 8 hours.
• Refrigerated (2-8°C): Up to 7 days.
• Frozen (-20°C or lower): Up to 30 days.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes and disposable tips
• Serum separator tubes (SST)
• Cortisol assay reagents (kit-specific)
• Calibrators and controls
• Approved cortisol analyzer (e.g., immunoassay analyzer)
• Gloves, lab coat, and other appropriate PPE
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation
1. Verify that all equipment and reagents are within calibration and
expiration dates.
2. Thaw frozen serum samples, if applicable, and bring them to
room temperature.
3. Mix samples gently to ensure homogeneity but avoid vigorous
shaking.
B. Calibration
1. Perform calibration of the cortisol analyzer according to the
manufacturer’s instructions using provided calibrators.
2. Document calibration results in the designated logbook.
C. Quality Control
1. Run internal quality control (QC) samples (both low and high
controls) at the beginning of each shift, after calibration, and
with each batch of samples.
2. Accept QC results that fall within the established acceptable
ranges. If QC results are outside the acceptable ranges,
troubleshoot and repeat QC. Do not proceed with patient
testing until satisfactory QC results are obtained.
D. Analytical Procedure
1. Label sample tubes with appropriate patient identification and
accession numbers.
2. Load serum samples into the analyzer according to the
manufacturer’s specifications.
3. Start the analytical run and monitor the process for any errors
or deviations.
4. Once analysis is complete, verify that the results are within
reporting limits. Flag and review any results that fall outside the
expected reference intervals or show error messages.
E. Reporting Results
1. Transmit results to the Laboratory Information System (LIS) for
review.
2. Review and verify each result for accuracy and consistency.
3. Document any comments or flags as necessary and approve
results for release.
4. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Normal cortisol levels in serum: Morning (7-9 am): 5-25 µg/dL
Afternoon (3-5 pm): 2-14 µg/dL
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolyzed samples may interfere with the cortisol assay and
lead to inaccurate results.
• Use of inappropriate anticoagulants or collection tubes may affect
the assay.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If initial troubleshooting steps do not resolve equipment errors or
QC failures, notify a supervisor and contact the instrument's
technical support for further assistance.
1. DOCUMENTATION
• Maintain records of calibration, QC, patient results, and any
incidents or deviations in dedicated logbooks or the LIS.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's instructions for the cortisol assay kit.
• CLSI guidelines for serum cortisol testing.
• Laboratory-specific procedures and guidelines.
1. APPROVAL AND REVIEW
This SOP must be reviewed and approved by the laboratory director
or designated personnel and reviewed annually or as necessary to
incorporate updates and changes in procedures or guidelines.
By following this SOP, the laboratory ensures the accurate and
reliable measurement of serum cortisol levels, contributing to the
effective diagnosis and management of conditions such as adrenal
disorders.
