SOP: Analysis of Cortisol Level in Left Adrenal Vein Serum
1. PURPOSE
This SOP delineates the procedure for analyzing cortisol levels in
serum collected from the left adrenal vein. Adhering to these
guidelines ensures accurate and consistent results which aid in the
clinical assessment of adrenal function.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory staff responsible for
processing and analyzing left adrenal vein serum samples for cortisol
levels in a CLIA-certified laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of trained laboratory personnel to perform the
analysis of cortisol levels in left adrenal vein serum samples following
this SOP. It is also their responsibility to document and report results
accurately, and to troubleshoot any issues encountering during the
analysis or interpretation of results.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Serum collected from the left adrenal vein.
• Collection: Specimens should be collected by a qualified
healthcare provider using appropriate venipuncture techniques
and stored at -20°C until the time of analysis.
• Volume: Minimum of 1 mL serum.
• Stability: Specimens are stable for up to 7 days when stored at
-20°C.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Equipment: Centrifuge, pipettes, cortisol assay instrumentation
(e.g., chemiluminescent immunoassay analyzers).
• Reagents: Specific reagents for cortisol assays as per supplier
specifications.
• Supplies: Serum storage tubes, gloves, disposable pipette tips.
6. PROCEDURE
• Preparation:
◦ Confirm details and labeling of the specimen tube.
◦ Thaw the serum specimen at room temperature.
• Centrifugation:
◦ Centrifuge the serum specimen at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes to
ensure separation of serum and cellular components.
• Assay Setup:
◦ Set up the cortisol assay instrumentation as per the
manufacturer's guidelines.
◦ Calibrate the cortisol assay instrumentation with standard
controls provided by the manufacturer.
◦ Ensure all reagents are within their expiry date and prepared
according to their package inserts.
• Analysis:
◦ Transfer 100 µL of the serum specimen to a sample cup.
◦ Load the sample cup onto the cortisol assay instrument.
◦ Follow the instrument's instructions to initiate the assay.
• Quality Control:
◦ Run internal quality control materials at the beginning of each
day and after every major batch processed.
◦ Verify results against control limits.
◦ Document any deviations and corrective actions taken.
7. TROUBLESHOOTING
• Failed Quality Control: If quality control fails, recalibrate the
instrument and repeat the analysis.
• Unexpected Results: If results are unexpected, repeat the
analysis with a fresh aliquot of the same specimen.
• Instrument Errors: In case of instrument error messages, follow
the troubleshooting guide as per the instrument manual or contact
technical support.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results are transmitted automatically to the Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
• Review and verify the results for accuracy.
• Report the results following site-specific guidelines, including any
comments on observed anomalies.
9. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Cortisol Levels: Reference intervals must be verified individually
with clinical context as the normal range for adrenal vein cortisol
can differ from peripheral levels.
10. DOCUMENTATION
• Maintain a log of all quality control runs, specimen analysis
details, and any troubleshooting steps taken.
• Ensure results are entered and verified in the LIS.
11. CLEANING AND MAINTENANCE
• Daily/weekly maintenance of the cortisol assay instrumentation as
per the manufacturer's instructions.
• Regular cleaning of workspaces and disposal of used supplies
following biohazard protocols.
