Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase Protocol for Generating Serum Cortisol
Results by Mass Spectrometry
1. PURPOSE
To ensure the accurate measurement of serum cortisol levels using
liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) in a
CLIA-certified laboratory. This procedure outlines the steps for
analysis, quality control, and reporting of cortisol results.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory staff, including technologists
and supervisors, are responsible for performing, documenting, and
verifying cortisol analyses using mass spectrometry according to this
SOP.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• LC-MS/MS system
• Serum cortisol calibrators and quality controls
• Internal standard (e.g., deuterated cortisol)
• HPLC-grade solvents (e.g., water, methanol, acetonitrile)
• Solid phase extraction (SPE) cartridges or liquid-liquid extraction
reagents
• Volumetric pipettes and tips
• Centrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Laboratory glassware and plasticware
• Data management system (LIS)
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/Acceptable:
• Serum: 1-2 mL collected in a serum separator tube (SST).
Specimens must be clotted, centrifuged, and separated within 2
hours of collection.
Unacceptable:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric specimens
• Incompletely filled or mislabeled tubes
• Specimens stored longer than 48 hours at 2-8°C without
aliquoting and freezing.
1. PROCEDURE
4.1 Preparation of Reagents and Standards:
• Prepare cortisol calibrators and quality control samples according
to manufacturer’s instructions.
• Prepare the internal standard working solution at an appropriate
concentration.
• Prepare mobile phase solutions using HPLC-grade solvents.
4.2 Sample Preparation:
• Thaw frozen serum samples at room temperature.
• If using SPE, condition the cartridges with solvents as per
manufacturer’s instructions.
• Add a known volume of internal standard to each serum sample.
• Extract cortisol using the chosen method (e.g., SPE or liquid-
liquid extraction).
• Evaporate the extracts to dryness and reconstitute in the mobile
phase.
4.3 Instrument Calibration and System Suitability:
• Calibrate the LC-MS/MS system using the prepared cortisol
calibrators.
• Run system suitability tests to ensure proper instrument
performance.
4.4 Analysis:
• Inject standards, quality controls, and patient samples into the LC-
MS/MS system.
• Ensure the sequence includes periodic quality controls to monitor
assay performance throughout the analysis.
4.5 Data Analysis and Reporting:
• Analyze chromatograms using the LC-MS/MS software.
• Quantify cortisol levels by comparing sample peaks to calibrator
peaks.
• Import results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS) for
review.
• Technologists review and verify results, checking for consistency
and quality control criteria.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
5.1 Internal Quality Control:
• Analyze quality control samples (low, medium, high) with each
batch of patient samples.
• Document and review QC results to confirm they are within
acceptable limits.
• Investigate and resolve any QC failures before reporting patient
results.
5.2 External Quality Control:
• Participate in proficiency testing as required by CLIA.
• Document results and corrective actions taken for any issues
identified during proficiency testing.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If issues arise with sample extraction, ensure that all reagents and
SPE cartridges are of acceptable quality and properly prepared.
• For instrument performance issues, refer to the manufacturer’s
troubleshooting guide.
• Document all troubleshooting actions and consult with a
supervisor if the problem persists.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Enter verified results into the LIS.
• Report results in accordance with laboratory policies and
reference intervals.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Ensure awareness of potential interferences specific to cortisol
measurement by LC-MS/MS.
• Cross-reactivity with structurally similar compounds should be
evaluated and noted.

• Manufacturer’s guidelines for calibrators, controls, and LC-MS/MS
system.
