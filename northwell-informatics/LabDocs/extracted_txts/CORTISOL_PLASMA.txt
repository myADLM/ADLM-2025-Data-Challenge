Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Determination of
Plasma Cortisol
1. PURPOSE
This procedure provides detailed instructions for performing the
measurement of plasma cortisol levels, ensuring consistent and
reliable results.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to the clinical biochemistry laboratory and is
intended to be used by qualified laboratory personnel trained in the
use of the assay for measuring cortisol in plasma.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• It is the responsibility of designated laboratory personnel to
perform the cortisol assay as described in this SOP.
• Laboratory supervisors are responsible for the training of
personnel on the procedure and ensuring adherence to protocols.
• All laboratory staff must report any deviations from this SOP or
equipment malfunctions to their supervisor.
4. EQUIPMENT, MATERIALS, AND REAGENTS
Equipment:
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes (fixed and adjustable)
• Microplate Reader or compatible analytical instrument
• Refrigerated storage (2-8°C)
• Vortex mixer
Materials:
• 96-well microplates
• Micropipette tips
• Sample tubes
Reagents:
• Cortisol ELISA kit (Ensure to check expiry date)
• Calibrators and controls specific to the assay
• Wash buffer
• Substrate reagent
• Stop solution
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Acceptable:
• Plasma samples collected in EDTA or heparinized tubes.
Unacceptable:
• Grossly hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric specimens.
• Samples not stored or transported under appropriate conditions
(i.e., room temperature >24 hours or refrigerated >48 hours).
6. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
• Verify that all reagents, calibrators, and controls are within their
expiration dates.
• Allow all test components and specimens to reach room
temperature (20-25°C) before use.
• Mix all reagents thoroughly before use without creating bubbles.
• Label the microplate layout plan detailing sample and standard
positions.
Assay Procedure:
1. Preparation of Standards and Controls:
◦ Prepare standards and controls as per the instructions
provided with the ELISA kit.
◦ Label the standards and controls accordingly for
identification.
2. Sample Preparation:
◦ If plasma samples have been frozen, thaw completely at
room temperature. Vortex briefly to ensure homogeneity.
◦ Centrifuge samples at 2,000-2,500 x g for 10 minutes to
remove any particulate matter.
3. Assay Setup:
◦ Add appropriate volumes (usually 50-100 µL) of calibrators,
controls, and plasma samples to the designated wells on the
microplate.
◦ Add the assay diluent buffer to each well as specified in the
kit instructions.
4. Incubation:
◦ Incubate the microplate as outlined in the ELISA kit
instructions (commonly 60-120 minutes at room
temperature).
5. Washing:
◦ Following incubation, wash the wells thoroughly with wash
buffer.
◦ Ensure all residual fluids are removed by tapping the plate
gently on absorbent paper.
6. Detection:
◦ Add enzyme-conjugate reagent to each well, followed by
another incubation period as specified.
◦ Perform a wash step again to remove any unbound
conjugate.
7. Substrate Addition:
◦ Add the substrate solution to each well. Allow the color to
develop in the dark for the designated time period.
◦ Stop the reaction by adding the stop solution to each well,
noting any color change.
8. Reading the Results:
◦ Read the optical density (OD) values of each well using a
microplate reader set to the wavelength specified in the
instructions (usually 450 nm).
◦ Calculate the cortisol concentrations based on the standard
curve plotted using the OD values of the standards.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Analyze quality control samples in each run. Ensure that the QC
results fall within the acceptable range before reporting patient
results.
• Deviations in QC results should be investigated, and the assay
repeated if necessary.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Validate and review the calculated results.
• Enter the results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS) for
verification and final approval.
• Flag any results that fall outside reference intervals or critical
limits. Notify the requesting clinician immediately for critical
results.
Reference Intervals:
• Normal range: 5-25 µg/dL (morning values)
9. ADDITIONAL NOTES
• Refer to the specific ELISA kit’s package insert for detailed
instructions on reagent preparation, assay range, and limitations.
• Document any deviations or anomalies observed during the
assay.
10. REFERENCES

• Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines.
• Relevant literature and previous assay validation data.
11. REVISION HISTORY
