STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE CORTISOL, RIGHT
ADRENAL VEIN, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
To ensure the accurate and timely analysis of serum cortisol levels in
samples from the right adrenal vein using validated laboratory
techniques.
RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory personnel to
ensure that the procedures outlined in this SOP are followed
stringently to generate accurate, reliable cortisol results.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type:
• Serum
Collection Tube:
• Serum Separator Tube (SST) or Red-top tube (no anticoagulant)
Volume:
• Minimum 5 mL of blood
Specimen Stability:
• Refrigerated (2-8°C): 7 days
• Frozen (-20°C): 6 months
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed samples
• Samples with an insufficient volume
• Samples not appropriately labeled or lacking necessary patient
information and collection time
3. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes and disposables
• ELISA Plate Reader or LC-MS/MS Analyzer
• Cortisol test reagent kits
• Calibrators and controls as provided by the reagent manufacturer
• Disposable gloves and PPE
• Specimen storage boxes
• Laboratory Information System (LIS)
4. QUALITY CONTROL
Quality Control Material:
• Commercially available control sera with known cortisol
concentrations
• Two levels of control (low and high cortisol concentrations)
• Store controls as per manufacturer instructions, typically at 2-8°C
Quality Control Procedure:
• Run control samples with each batch of patient samples
• Acceptable control ranges must be within the manufacturer’s
provided limits
5. PROCEDURE
Specimen Preparation:
1. Allow the collected blood samples to clot at room temperature
for 30 minutes.
2. Centrifuge the blood samples at 2000-3000 RPM for 10-15
minutes.
3. Carefully transfer the serum into appropriately labeled storage
tubes to avoid hemolysis.
4. Refrigerate or freeze the serum samples as needed based on
the expected analysis timing.
Cortisol Analysis:
1. Bring all reagents, calibrators, controls, and patient specimens
to room temperature before analysis.
2. Follow the reagent kit manufacturer’s instructions for preparing
the reaction plate or LC-MS/MS as needed.
3. Calibrate the analyzer using the provided calibrators ensuring
calibration curve meets criteria.
4. Prepare the controls and patient samples as per the reagent kit
instructions.
5. Load the calibrators, controls, and patient samples into the
analyzer or setup the ELISA plate accordingly.
6. Initiate the analysis run by following the analyzer or ELISA plate
reader’s protocol.
7. Verify the results to ensure that the control values are within the
acceptable range before releasing patient results.
6. REPORTING OF RESULTS
1. Results will be automatically transmitted to the LIS system upon
completion of the analysis.
2. Review results and ensure the control and calibration runs meet
quality standards.
3. Verify and release the patient results in the LIS.
4. Report notable deviations or critical values immediately to the
referring physician following the lab's critical result policy.
5. Document all findings, including deviations and fault handling,
in the laboratory logbook.
7. TROUBLESHOOTING AND CORRECTIVE ACTIONS
If Results Fall Outside Acceptable Limits:
1. Verify the functionality of the analyzer by re-running the quality
controls.
2. If controls fail, re-run the calibrators ensuring no technical
issues such as reagent degradation.
3. In case of consistent failures, consult the analyzer's
troubleshooting guide or contact technical support.
4. Document corrective measures applied in the laboratory log.
8. MAINTENANCE
Daily:
• Ensure all instruments are cleaned and maintained as per the
manufacturer's recommendations.
As Required:
• Perform calibration verification as per instrument guidelines.
• Ensure regular maintenance checks are conducted and logged in
instrument records.
