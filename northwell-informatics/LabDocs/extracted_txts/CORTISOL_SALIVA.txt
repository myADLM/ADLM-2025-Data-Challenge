Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Title: Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for CORTISOL, SALIVA
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the procedures for the accurate and reliable
determination of cortisol levels in saliva samples using enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or chemiluminescent immunoassay
(CLIA) methodologies.
Responsibility:
Personnel trained in saliva cortisol analysis are responsible for
executing the procedures outlined in this document and ensuring all
results are reliable and validated before reporting. It is the
responsibility of the laboratory supervisor to ensure the procedures
are adhered to and to address any discrepancies or issues that may
arise.
1. DEFINITION
Saliva cortisol assay: A diagnostic test that measures the cortisol
levels in a saliva sample to assess adrenal function and stress
response.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Processing
1. Check receipt and accession
◦ Verify sample collection details (date, time, and condition).
◦ Accept only samples collected in sterile tubes specifically
designed for saliva collection.
2. Storage
◦ Store saliva samples at 2-8°C if analysis is to be performed
within 24 hours.
◦ For longer storage, freeze samples at -20°C or lower.
B. Pre-Analytical Preparation
1. Thaw frozen samples at room temperature.
2. Ensure samples are homogenized by vigorous mixing to avoid
stratification.
3. Centrifuge samples at 1500 x g for 10 minutes to remove
particulate matter.
4. Collect clear supernatant for analysis.
C. Reagents and Equipment
1. ELISA Kit/CLIA Kit for Cortisol.
2. Microplate Reader (for ELISA) or Chemiluminescent assay
reader (for CLIA).
3. Centrifuge.
4. Pipettes and tips.
5. Vortex mixer.
6. Timer.
D. Assay Procedure (ELISA Example)
1. Setup
◦ Set up the ELISA plate according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
◦ Include standards, controls, and saliva samples in
duplicates.
2. Addition of Reagents
◦ Add 100 µL of standards, controls, and saliva samples to the
designated wells.
◦ Add the enzyme conjugate and substrate solution as per the
kit manufacturer's instructions.
3. Incubation
◦ Incubate the plate at specified temperature and duration as
per the kit instructions (usually 37°C for 60 minutes).
4. Washing
◦ Wash the plate thoroughly (typically 3-5 times) using the
provided wash buffer.
5. Detection
◦ Add the stop solution to halt the reaction.
◦ Read the absorbance at the appropriate wavelength (usually
450 nm) within 15 minutes.
E. Assay Procedure (CLIA Example)
1. Setup
◦ Set up the chemiluminescent assay according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Include standards, controls, and saliva samples in
duplicates.
2. Addition of Reagents
◦ Add appropriate volume of standards, controls, and saliva
samples to assay tubes or wells.
◦ Add labeled antibodies and chemiluminescent substrate as
per the kit instructions.
3. Incubation
◦ Incubate the reaction mixture at specified temperature and
duration as per the kit instructions.
4. Washing
◦ Wash reaction mixture according to the provided protocol.
5. Detection
◦ Measure the chemiluminescent signal using the luminescent
assay reader.
F. Quality Control
1. Run positive and negative controls with each batch of samples.
2. Ensure the control results fall within the manufacturer’s
acceptable range before validating sample results.
3. Follow corrective actions for any deviations outside acceptable
limits and repeat the assay if necessary.
G. Reporting Results
1. Calculate the sample cortisol concentration based on standard
curve obtained from controls and standards.
2. Record results in Laboratory Information System (LIS).
3. Verify and review results for any inconsistencies or outliers.
4. Report results following site-specific guidelines.
H. Reference Ranges
• Morning (8 AM): 0.1-0.6 µg/dL
• Afternoon (4 PM): 0.04-0.3 µg/dL
I. Method Limitations
Refer to the manufacturer's insert for specific reagent and assay
limitations.
