Standard Operating Procedure
CORTISOL, SERUM ANALYSIS
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the procedure for the quantitative measurement of
cortisol in serum samples using specific analytical methods. This
procedure is intended to ensure accurate and reproducible results in
compliance with CLIA regulations.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
Qualified laboratory technologists are responsible for performing the
cortisol assay following this SOP. It is the responsibility of all
technologists to identify and report any deviations or issues in the
procedure to the supervisor promptly.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Acceptable Specimens:
• Serum collected in SST (serum separator tube) or plain red-top
tube.
• Freshly collected serum samples should be transported to the
laboratory promptly. If not immediately analyzed, samples can be
stored at 2-8°C for up to 72 hours or frozen at -20°C for longer-
term storage.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens collected in any tube containing anticoagulants such
as EDTA, sodium citrate, or heparin.
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples should be avoided if
possible.
• Specimens arriving in the laboratory without proper labeling or
documentation.
Preparation:
• Allow serum samples to clot for 30 minutes and centrifuge at
1500-2000 g for 10 minutes to separate serum.
• Aliquot the serum into appropriately labeled tubes.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Required Equipment:
• Automated immunoassay analyzer or manual ELISA kit.
• Centrifuge.
• Pipettes.
• Refrigerators and freezers for specimen storage.
Required Reagents:
• Immunoassay kit for cortisol detection.
• Calibration standards and control materials specific to the assay.
• Wash solutions and substrate reagents provided in the
immunoassay kit.
Quality Control:
• Utilize two levels (low/high) of control material for each batch of
serum cortisol tests.
• Controls must be assayed alongside patient samples to ensure
assay reliability.
5. PROCEDURE
Sample Analysis:
1. Bring all reagents, controls, and samples to room temperature
before analysis.
2. Prepare the calibration curve using the provided standards.
Ensure the concentration range is suitable for the expected
levels of cortisol in serum.
3. Calibrate the immunoassay analyzer according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
4. Load the samples, controls, and calibration standards into the
analyzer.
5. Start the assay run, following the specific instructions provided
by the immunoassay kit or the analyzer manual.
Manual ELISA Method:
1. Add required volumes of patient serum, standard, and control
samples to the microplate.
2. Follow the sequence of reagent additions and incubation times
specified in the ELISA kit instructions.
3. Measure the absorbance at the specified wavelength using a
plate reader.
4. Calculate the cortisol concentrations using the calibration curve.
Quality Control and Troubleshooting:
• Review control results to ensure they fall within the acceptable
range. If controls fail, do not report patient results and
troubleshoot the assay.
• If recalibration is required, use freshly prepared standards.
• If necessary, repeat the analysis using fresh aliquots of the patient
sample.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
Reference Intervals:
• Verify reference intervals with each batch as specified in the
assay kit insert.
• Typical reference ranges for cortisol in serum:
◦ Morning (7-10am): 5-25 µg/dL
◦ Afternoon (4-8pm): 2-14 µg/dL
Verification and Documentation:
• Check each result for consistency and compliance with the quality
control guidelines.
• Enter patient results into the LIS (Laboratory Information System)
ensuring proper documentation and verification.
• Critical results must be promptly reported to the requesting
physician according to laboratory protocols.
7. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to the specific assay kit insert for limitations regarding
cross-reactivity, sensitivity, and specificity.
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples may affect assay
performance and should be noted in the report.
