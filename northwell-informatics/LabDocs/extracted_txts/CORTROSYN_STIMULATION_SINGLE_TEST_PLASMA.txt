CORTROSYN STIMULATION,
SINGLE TEST, PLASMA
1. PURPOSE
To ensure accurate and timely results for CORTROSYN stimulation
test using single plasma samples in the clinical laboratory.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENT
Preferred/acceptable:
• 2 mL plasma collected in EDTA tube is preferred.
• The specimen must be properly labeled with patient identification
and collection time.
• Specimens should be transported to the laboratory as soon as
possible and preferably analyzed within 2 hours of collection.
• If immediate analysis is not possible, plasma should be separated
and refrigerated at 2-8°C for up to 72 hours.
Unacceptable:
• Samples collected in tubes other than EDTA.
• Specimens with clotting, hemolysis, or not properly labeled.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND
SUPPLIES
• EDTA tubes.
• Centrifuge.
• Refrigerated storage.
• Cortisol reagent kits (as supplied by the specific analyzer
manufacturer).
• Approved and currently calibrated clinical chemistry analyzer.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform quality control checks by using two levels of
commercially available control materials.
• Run quality controls before patient samples, after every 20 patient
samples, and at the end of each shift.
• Document and investigate any out-of-range quality control results,
and do not release results until quality controls are within
acceptable limits.
5. PROCEDURE
Specimen Handling
1. Ensure proper specimen identification and labeling.
2. Centrifuge the EDTA tube at 1500-2000 g for 10 minutes to
separate plasma.
3. Transfer plasma into properly labeled aliquot tubes.
4. Store aliquoted plasma at 2-8°C if the analysis cannot be
performed immediately.
Test Procedure
1. Turn on the clinical chemistry analyzer and ensure it is ready for
operation.
2. Load the calibration curve and verify that it is still valid. Perform
a calibration if necessary.
3. Load the reagent kit specific to the Cortisol assay onto the
analyzer.
4. Follow the instructions in the reagent kit insert for loading and
operating the analyzer.
5. Program the analyzer to run the test using the plasma sample.
6. Place patient plasma samples and quality control materials onto
the sample tray.
7. Start the analysis sequence.
8. The analyzer will measure and automatically generate results
for the cortisol levels.
Report Generation
1. Verify that analyzer results are within acceptable calibration and
quality control ranges.
2. Review the generated results in the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
3. Approve and print the finalized report.
4. Attach required documentation, including quality control results
and sample logs.
5. Sign off on the patient report and ensure it is communicated to
the appropriate healthcare provider.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
1. The results are automatically transmitted to the LIS and must
be reviewed and verified by the technologist.
2. Generate and review the final report indicating the cortisol level.
3. If the cortisol level is outside expected reference ranges,
appropriate comments will be included.
7. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• The reference range for basal (pre-stimulation) cortisol level is
typically 5-25 mcg/dL.
• Post-CORTROSYN stimulation cortisol level should ideally
exceed 18 mcg/dL.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolysis, lipemia, and icterus may interfere with the cortisol
assay.
• Ensure samples are free of any visible particulate matter.

hormone assays.

cortisol levels.
Ensure all laboratory staff are trained in this protocol and understand
the importance of following each step accurately to ensure the
integrity and reliability of the CORTROSYN stimulation test results.
