Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) for CORTROSYN
STIMULATION TEST, PLASMA
1. PURPOSE
This protocol outlines the steps for performing the CORTROSYN
Stimulation Test to assess the adrenal gland function through the
evaluation of plasma cortisol levels before and after administration of
synthetic adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH).
RESPONSIBILITY:
Designated laboratory technologists are responsible for performing
the CORTROSYN Stimulation Test accurately and timely. All
personnel must follow the SOP to ensure the reliability and
consistency of the test results.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Collection and Handling:
• Preferred Specimen: Plasma collected in EDTA or heparinized
tubes.
• Collection Conditions: Two separate blood samples should be
collected—one prior to the administration of CORTROSYN (0-
minute sample) and the other one after 30 or 60 minutes post-
administration (30-minute or 60-minute sample).
• Volume: Collect at least 3 mL of blood per sample.
• Stability: The specimens should be centrifuged, and plasma
separated within 30 minutes after collection. Plasma samples
must be stored at refrigerative conditions (2-8°C) if not analyzed
immediately.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens with hemolysis or other contamination.
• Specimen not properly labeled with collection time and patient
information.
• Specimens received more than 2 hours after collection if not
refrigerated or more than 24 hours if refrigerated.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Centrifuge
• Refrigerator (2-8°C)
• Automated cortisol assay analyzer (e.g., Roche Cobas e411)
• Pipettes and tips
Reagents:
• Cortisol assay calibration and control materials
• Quality Control materials specific for cortisol analysis
Supplies:
• EDTA tubes or heparinized tubes
• Labels for proper identification
• Refrigerated centrifuge tubes
1. PROCEDURE
Step-by-Step Procedure:
1. Pre-Test Preparation:
◦ Verify patient details and consent for CORTROSYN
Stimulation Test.
◦ Prepare CORTROSYN injection as per manufacturer's
instructions. Typically, 0.25 mg is used for adults.
2. Specimen Collection:
◦ At 0 minutes: Collect the first blood sample in an EDTA or
heparinized tube prior to CORTROSYN injection.
◦ Administer CORTROSYN intramuscularly or intravenously
as per clinical protocol.
◦ At 30 or 60 minutes: Collect the second blood sample in an
EDTA or heparinized tube post-CORTROSYN
administration.
3. Specimen Processing:
◦ Centrifuge the blood samples at 3000 RPM for 10 minutes.
◦ Separate the plasma immediately after centrifugation.
◦ Label the plasma samples clearly indicating ‘0 minute’ and
‘30 minute’ or ‘60 minute.’
4. Cortisol Assay:
◦ Set up the automated cortisol assay analyzer according to
manufacturer’s guidelines.
◦ Prepare calibration curve using cortisol calibrators.
◦ Load quality control samples and verify the analyzer’s
performance.
◦ Load patient plasma samples, ensuring correct identification
and positioning.
◦ Start the assay and monitor the progress.
5. Data Analysis:
◦ Review generated cortisol values for both 0-minute and
post-administration plasma samples.
◦ Ensure quality control results fall within acceptable limits
before verifying the patient results.
6. Result Verification and Reporting:
◦ Verify integrity of results post-analysis.
◦ Compare baseline cortisol levels with stimulated cortisol
levels.
◦ Document results in the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
◦ Generate reports with reference ranges and authoritative
interpretative statements.
◦ Communicate results to the requesting clinician.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
Material:
• Perform daily quality control using two levels (low and high) of
cortisol control materials.
• Record control results and evaluate against established
acceptable ranges.
Procedure:
• Each new bottle or lot of reagents must be validated with control
materials.
• Maintain proper documentation of control results and any
corrective actions taken if controls exceed acceptable limits.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Use established reference ranges for cortisol assay:
• Baseline (0-minute): Expected range in morning: 7-25 μg/dL
• Post-stimulation: Typically, peak cortisol value should be ≥ 18 μg/
dL at 30 or 60 minutes depending on clinical guidelines.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to automated cortisol assay manufacturer's insert for specific
limitations regarding interference and cross-reactivity.
