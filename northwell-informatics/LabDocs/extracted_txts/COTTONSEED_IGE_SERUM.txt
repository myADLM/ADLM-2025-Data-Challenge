Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for COTTONSEED (IGE), SERUM
1. Purpose: To provide a detailed procedure for the analytical
phase of testing serum for specific IgE antibodies to cottonseed
using the appropriate immunoassay methods. This ensures the
reliability and accuracy of test results.
2. Definitions: IgE: Immunoglobulin E - an antibody associated
with allergic reactions. Cottonseed: A common allergen for
which specific IgE levels are being tested.
3. Specimen Requirements and Stability:
◦ Type: Serum
◦ Volume: Minimum 1 mL
◦ Collection Instructions:
▪ Collect blood using a serum separator tube (SST).
▪ Allow the blood to clot for 30 minutes.
▪ Centrifuge the SST at 1500-2000 x g for 10 minutes to
separate the serum.
◦ Storage: Serum specimens can be stored at 2-8°C for up to
7 days. For longer storage, specimens should be frozen at
-20°C.
4. Equipment and Reagents:
◦ Immunoassay analyzer (e.g., ImmunoCAP, RAST)
◦ Cottonseed allergen-specific IgE reagent kit
◦ Calibrators
◦ Quality control materials (positive and negative controls)
◦ Laboratory consumables (pipettes, tips, tubes)
5. Calibration and Quality Control:
◦ Perform calibration according to the manufacturer's
instructions using the provided calibrators.
◦ Run quality control materials at the beginning of each
testing day, and after every 20 samples.
◦ Document all calibration and QC results. If QC results are
out of the acceptable range, troubleshoot per
manufacturer’s guidelines.
6. Procedure:
◦ Preparation:
▪ Thaw any frozen specimens at room temperature and
mix thoroughly before use.
▪ Inspect specimens for hemolysis, lipemia, or particulate
matter. Document and reject any unacceptable
specimens.
◦ Testing:
1. Loading Specimens:
▪ Load the serum specimens, calibrators, and quality
control materials into the immunoassay analyzer.
2. Programming the Analyzer:
▪ Enter patient information and select the appropriate
test for cottonseed-specific IgE.
3. Analysis:
▪ Run the assay according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
4. Result Verification:
▪ Review the analyzer output for flags or error
messages.
▪ Ensure that all control results are within the
acceptable range before reporting patient results.
7. Result Interpretation and Reporting:
◦ Quantitative results are expressed in kU/L.
◦ Reference Interval:
▪ < 0.35 kU/L: Negative (No detectable allergen-specific
IgE)
▪ 0.35 - 0.69 kU/L: Low level of allergen-specific IgE
▪ 0.70 - 3.49 kU/L: Moderate level of allergen-specific IgE
▪ 3.50 - 17.49 kU/L: High level of allergen-specific IgE
▪ 17.50 - 49.99 kU/L: Very high level of allergen-specific
IgE
▪ ≥ 50.00 kU/L: Extremely high level of allergen-specific
IgE
◦ Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
and ensure accurate transcription of data.
◦ Reviewed and approve the results before releasing them to
the clinician.
8. Quality Control and Troubleshooting:
◦ If quality control results fail, review the assay procedure and
equipment maintenance logs.
◦ Re-calibrate or perform troubleshooting as per the
manufacturer's instructions.
◦ Do not report patient results until the assay is functioning
properly.
9. References:
◦ Manufacturer's kit insert and operation manual for the
specific immunoassay analyzer.
◦ CLSI Guidelines for Immunoglobulin Measurements.
10. Attachments:
◦ Example of a completed Quality Control log.
◦ Trouble-shooting flow chart for immunoassay analyzer error
codes.
◦ Calibration records and maintenance log template.
This SOP will guide designated laboratory staff in performing the
analytical phase of generating results for cottonseed-specific IgE
from serum, ensuring consistency and accuracy in allergen-specific
immunoglobulin E testing.
