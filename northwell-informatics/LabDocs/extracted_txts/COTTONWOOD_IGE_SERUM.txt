Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analysis of
Cottonwood-Specific IgE in Serum
1. PURPOSE
To describe the procedure for the quantitative analysis of
cottonwood-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) in human serum using a
validated immunoassay method (e.g., enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay (ELISA) or automated chemiluminescent immunoassay).
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all designated laboratory personnel trained
in immunoassay techniques for the detection and quantification of
specific allergens in serum. It is intended to ensure consistent,
accurate, and reliable results while maintaining compliance with
governing regulations and industry best practices.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Laboratory Technologists: Responsible for performing the
analysis according to this SOP, maintaining records, and ensuring
quality control measures are followed.
• Supervisors/Managers: Ensure all personnel are adequately
trained, SOPs are adhered to, and any deviations are
documented and addressed.
• Quality Assurance Personnel: Oversee compliance with
protocols, review quality control data, and perform periodic audits.
4. DEFINITION
• Cottonwood Specific IgE: Antibodies (immunoglobulin E) in the
blood specifically targeting the cottonwood allergen.
• Serum: The component of blood collected after allowing the blood
to clot and removing the clotting factors.
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Collection and Handling
• Preferred specimen: Serum.
• Collect blood in a serum separator tube (SST) or a plain red-top
tube.
• Allow the blood to clot at room temperature (15-25°C) for a
minimum of 30 minutes and a maximum of 60 minutes.
• Centrifuge the blood sample at 1,500 x g for 10 minutes to
separate the serum.
• Transfer the serum to a clean, labelled tube without disturbing the
cell layer.
• Store the serum at 2-8°C if analysis is to be performed within 72
hours. For longer storage, freeze the serum at -20°C or lower.
Unacceptable Specimens
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
• Specimens that have been subjected to freeze-thaw cycles more
than once.
6. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Equipment: Centrifuge, incubator, ELISA reader or automated
immunoassay analyzer, pipettes, vortex mixer.
• Reagents: ELISA kits or reagent cartridges specific for
cottonwood IgE, calibrators, controls, wash buffer, substrate, stop
solution.
• Supplies: Serum separator tubes (SST), red-top tubes, specimen
transport tubes, disposable pipette tips, gloves, and biohazard
disposal containers.
7. PROCEDURE
A. Reagent Preparation
1. Prepare all reagents according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
2. Equilibrate all reagents to room temperature (15-25°C) before
use.
3. Reconstitute calibrators and controls as per manufacturer
guidelines.
B. Calibration and Quality Control
1. Run calibrators to establish the standard curve as per the
assay's instructions.
2. Run low, medium, and high controls with each batch of samples
to ensure the assay is functioning correctly.
3. Acceptable control ranges must be established and
documented.
C. Sample Analysis
1. Manual ELISA Method:
◦ Add the prescribed volume of standards, controls, and
serum samples into designated wells of the microplate.
◦ Follow incubation steps with appropriate buffers, washes,
and substrate development according to kit instructions.
◦ Stop the reaction using the provided stop solution.
◦ Read the optical density (OD) at the specified wavelength
using an ELISA reader.
2. Automated Chemiluminescent Immunoassay Method:
◦ Load samples, reagents, calibrators, and controls into the
automated analyzer.
◦ Follow the on-screen prompts and manufacturer's
instructions for the analysis process.
◦ The analyzer will automatically measure and calculate IgE
concentrations.
D. Data Interpretation
1. Review the standard curve and ensure calibrators meet
acceptable criteria.
2. Verify control samples are within the acceptable range.
3. Calculate the concentration of cottonwood-specific IgE using
the standard curve or the automated analyzer’s software.
E. Reporting Results
1. Review and verify patient results.
2. Transmit results to the Laboratory Information System (LIS) for
reporting.
3. Critical results must be promptly communicated to the
requesting healthcare provider and documented accordingly.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform quality control with each batch of tests using
commercially available control sera.
• Records of quality control results must be reviewed and approved
before releasing patient results.
• At least two levels of controls should be used within each assay
run: one above and one below the clinical decision point.
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolyzed or lipemic samples may interfere with test results.
• Ensure proper pipetting techniques and adherence to incubation
times for optimal results.
• Follow specific guidelines provided in the kit insert for known
assay limitations.
10. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions and package inserts for the specific
IgE ELISA or automated chemiluminescent assay kits used.
• CLSI guidelines for Serum Immunoglobulin testing.
• Relevant laboratory safety and handling protocols.

A. CALIBRATION AND QUALITY CONTROL PROCEDURES
• Ensure that all pipettes and equipment are calibrated regularly.
• Record batch numbers, expiration dates, and preparation dates
for all reagents used.
This SOP ensures reliable and accurate quantification of cottonwood-
specific IgE in serum to aid in the diagnosis and management of
allergic conditions. Consistent adherence to the SOP will ensure high
standards of laboratory practice and patient care.
