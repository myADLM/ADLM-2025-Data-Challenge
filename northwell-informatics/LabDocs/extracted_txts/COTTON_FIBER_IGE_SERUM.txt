STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP) FOR THE
ANALYTICAL PHASE OF GENERATING RESULTS FOR COTTON
FIBER, IGE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this SOP is to outline the
procedures for the analytical phase of generating results for
Cotton Fiber, IgE, Serum in order to ensure the accuracy,
precision, and reliability of results. This involves the detection
and quantification of IgE antibodies specific to cotton fiber
allergens in the serum of patients.
2. SCOPE This procedure applies to all staff in the clinical
laboratory who are responsible for performing Cotton Fiber, IgE,
Serum assays.
3. RESPONSIBILITY It is the responsibility of all designated
laboratory personnel to carry out the following procedures as
described, document all findings accurately, perform necessary
quality control measures, and ensure that all results are verified
before release.
4. DEFINITIONS
• Serum: The component of blood obtained after coagulation and
removal of cells.
• IgE: Immunoglobulin E, a class of antibodies associated with
allergic reactions.
• Analytical Phase: The series of processes associated with the
analysis and measurement of analyte concentration.
1. REAGENTS, MATERIALS, AND EQUIPMENT
• Anti-human IgE coated microtiter plates
• Cotton Fiber allergen extract
• Calibration standards
• Sample diluent
• Washing buffer
• Enzyme conjugate (e.g., HRP anti-IgE)
• Substrate solution (e.g., TMB)
• Stop solution (e.g., 1N H2SO4)
• Plate reader capable of reading absorbance at 450 nm
• Microtiter plate washer (optional)
• Serum samples
• Pipettes and tips
• Tubes for sample preparation
• (Optional) Automated ELISA processor
1. PROCEDURE A. Preparation
• Verify that the temperature and humidity levels of the laboratory
are within acceptable limits: 20-26°C for temperature and 15-85%
for humidity as specified in the laboratory’s environmental control
SOP.
• Prepare and label all reagents and calibrators.
• Allow reagents and serum samples to reach room temperature
(20-25°C) before beginning the assay.
B. Sample Preparation
• Centrifuge serum samples at 1,500 x g for 10 minutes to remove
any particulate matter.
• If samples were refrigerated, bring them to room temperature.
C. Assay Procedure
1. Add 100 µL of standards, controls, and diluted serum samples
(1:10 dilution in sample diluent) into the appropriate wells of the
anti-human IgE coated microtiter plate.
2. Incubate the plate at room temperature (20-25°C) for 60
minutes.
3. Wash the wells with the provided washing buffer (5 cycles of
washing with 300 µL per well).
4. Add 100 µL of enzyme conjugate into each well.
5. Incubate the plate at room temperature for 30 minutes.
6. Wash the wells again (5 cycles of washing with 300 µL per
well).
7. Add 100 µL of substrate solution into each well.
8. Incubate the plate at room temperature in the dark for 15
minutes.
9. Add 50 µL of stop solution to each well.
10. Read the absorbance of each well at 450 nm within 15 minutes
of stopping the reaction.
D. Result Calculation and Interpretation
• Generate a standard curve by plotting the absorbance of the
standards against their respective concentrations.
• Calculate the concentration of IgE specific to Cotton Fiber in each
sample using the standard curve.
• Report results in kU/L.
1. QUALITY CONTROL AND CALIBRATION
• Run quality control samples (positive and negative controls) with
each batch of samples.
• The assay run is considered valid if the controls fall within the
specified ranges.
• If controls are out of range, identify and correct the error before
reanalyzing samples.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results will be automatically transferred to the Laboratory
Information System (LIS) and must be reviewed and verified by
the performing technologist.
• Any results outside of the analytical measurement range should
be reported with appropriate comments indicating “> highest
standard” or “< lowest standard.”
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• < 0.35 kU/L: Negative
• 0.35 kU/L - 0.70 kU/L: Low
• 0.70 kU/L - 3.50 kU/L: Moderate
• 3.50 kU/L - 17.50 kU/L: High
• 17.50 kU/L: Very High
1. LIMITATIONS
• Hemolyzed or lipemic samples may interfere with the assay.
• IgE test results should be interpreted in conjunction with clinical
findings and other diagnostic procedures.
1. SAFETY
• Follow all safety protocols as per the laboratory’s safety
guidelines.
• Handle all biological samples and reagents as potentially
infectious.

1. DOCUMENTATION
• Record all temperatures, reagent lot numbers, control results, and
any deviations in the appropriate logs.
• Ensure that all results are properly documented in the LIS and
retain records for a minimum of the period required by regulatory
standards.
