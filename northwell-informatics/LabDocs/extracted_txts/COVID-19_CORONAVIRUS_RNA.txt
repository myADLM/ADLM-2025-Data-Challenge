Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for COVID-19 Coronavirus RNA
1. PURPOSE
This SOP defines the procedures for the detection of SARS-CoV-2
RNA using the Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction
(RT-PCR) method. This protocol ensures consistency, accuracy, and
reliability in testing patient samples for COVID-19.
2. SCOPE
This protocol applies to all laboratory personnel involved in the
analysis and processing of samples for SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection.
It covers procedures from sample preparation to the final reporting of
results.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of designated laboratory personnel to follow this
SOP accurately. Any deviations, errors, or issues must be reported to
the Laboratory Supervisor or Director immediately.
4. DEFINITIONS
• SARS-CoV-2: Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus
2; causative agent of COVID-19.
• RT-PCR: Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction, a
laboratory technique used to amplify RNA sequences.
• Ct Value: Cycle threshold value, indicating the point at which the
fluorescence exceeds the threshold limit during the PCR process.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• RT-PCR instruments (e.g., ABI 7500, Bio-Rad CFX96)
• Viral transport medium (VTM)
• Nucleic acid extraction kits (e.g., Qiagen, MagMAX)
• RT-PCR kits for SARS-CoV-2 detection (e.g., Thermo Fisher
TaqPath COVID-19 Combo Kit)
• Pipettes and pipette tips (filtered)
• Vortex mixer
• Microcentrifuge
• Microplates or PCR tubes
• Gloves, lab coats, and other personal protective equipment (PPE)
6. PROCEDURE
6.1 Sample Preparation
• Receiving Specimens: Verify that specimens have been properly
accessioned and that all identifiers match those on the
accompanying requisition form.
• Storage: Store specimens at 2-8°C if testing will occur within 72
hours. For longer storage periods, freeze specimens at -70°C or
colder.
• Specimen Preparation:
◦ Mix the specimen thoroughly.
◦ If needed, inactivate the virus according to the kit or
institutional guidelines.
6.2 Nucleic Acid Extraction
• Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for the nucleic acid
extraction kit in use.
• Ensure all reagents are thawed and prepared as per instructions.
• Extract RNA from the samples and include controls (positive,
negative, and internal) alongside clinical specimens.
• Elute RNA in the appropriate volume as specified in the kit
manual.
6.3 RT-PCR Setup
• Master Mix Preparation:
◦ Prepare the RT-PCR master mix according to the instructions
provided with the RT-PCR kit.
◦ Allocate sufficient volume for all samples and controls, with an
additional 10% for pipetting errors.
• Plate Setup:
◦ Dispense the RT-PCR master mix into each well/tube.
◦ Add the extracted RNA to the respective wells/tubes.
◦ Seal the plate with adhesive film or caps, ensuring no cross-
contamination.
6.4 RT-PCR Instrument Settings
• Program the RT-PCR instrument according to the PCR kit
instructions, ensuring the correct cycling conditions:
◦ Reverse transcription: 10 minutes at 50°C
◦ Initial denaturation: 2 minutes at 95°C
◦ Amplification (40-45 cycles):
▪ Denaturation: 15 seconds at 95°C
▪ Annealing/Extension: 1 minute at 60°C
6.5 Data Analysis and Results Interpretation
• Threshold Setting: Set the fluorescence threshold above the
baseline and ensure it is within the exponential phase of the
amplification curve.
• Ct Value Interpretation:
◦ Positive for SARS-CoV-2: Ct ≤ 40 for at least one gene target.
◦ Negative for SARS-CoV-2: No Ct value or Ct > 40 for all gene
targets.
◦ Inconclusive: If only one target is positive, retest the specimen.
6.6 Quality Control
• Include positive, negative, and internal controls in every run.
• Validate each run by ensuring controls perform within expected
ranges.
• Repeat testing if controls do not meet the expected criteria.
6.7 Reporting of Results
• Document the results in the laboratory information system (LIS).
• Critical values should be communicated immediately to the
requesting physician or healthcare provider.
• Ensure all results are reviewed and verified before final reporting.
