SOP: Analytical Phase of Generating Results for COVID-19, Flu
A/B, and RSV
1. PURPOSE
This SOP describes the steps for the analytical phase of generating
results for COVID-19, Influenza A & B, and Respiratory Syncytial
Virus (RSV) using a molecular testing method. The purpose is to
ensure accurate identification and reporting of these respiratory
pathogens in patient specimens.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
Qualified laboratory staff who are trained and certified in performing
molecular diagnostic tests are responsible for the analysis. It is also
the responsibility of the laboratory supervisor to ensure the
adherence to this protocol and proper documentation of results.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND MATERIALS
• Real-time PCR Instrument (e.g., ABI 7500, Roche LightCycler)
• RNA extraction kit (e.g., QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit)
• Test kit specific for COVID-19, Flu A/B, and RSV (e.g., CDC 2019-
Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic
Panel, Cepheid Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV)
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred specimens: Nasopharyngeal swabs, Oropharyngeal
swabs, Nasal swabs, or Nasopharyngeal aspirates
• Ensure specimens are collected in the appropriate viral transport
medium.
1. PROCEDURE
A) Sample Preparation
• All specimens must be processed in a biosafety cabinet following
appropriate biosafety protocols.
• Record specimen information including ID, date, and time of
collection in the laboratory information system (LIS).
• Mix the specimen collection medium thoroughly before aliquoting.
B) RNA Extraction
• Follow the manufacturer’s instructions provided in the RNA
extraction kit.
• Ensure all equipment and reagents are prepared as per the RNA
extraction kit protocols.
• Elute RNA into nuclease-free water or elution buffer provided in
the kit.
• Perform a quality check on RNA by measuring the concentration
using a NanoDrop or similar device.
C) Preparation of Real-Time PCR Master Mix
• Thaw all reagents (master mix, primers, probes) on ice.
• In a clean area, prepare the master mix as per the kit's
instructions.
• Add the extracted RNA to the master mix in a separate PCR clean
area to prevent contamination.
• Ensure real-time PCR positive and negative controls are included
in the run.
D) Loading the Real-Time PCR Instrument
• Program the real-time PCR instrument with the appropriate
thermal cycling conditions according to the kit’s instructions.
• Load reaction tubes/strips/plate into the instrument.
• Start the PCR run.
• Monitor the PCR run for any instrument errors or abnormalities.
1. RESULTS INTERPRETATION
• At the end of the run, review amplification plots and Ct (cycle
threshold) values.
• Compare the Ct values with predetermined threshold values to
determine positive or negative results for each target (COVID-19,
Flu A/B, and RSV).
• Document results in the LIS and cross-check with internal QC
results.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Negative and positive controls must be processed and analyzed
with each sample batch.
• If controls fail, the batch must be invalidated, and samples
reprocessed.
• Maintain calibration logs for the real-time PCR instrument and
validate assays as per regulatory guidelines.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Verify all results with the laboratory supervisor before release.
• Report positive and negative results as “Detected” or “Not
Detected”.
• Follow the local public health guidelines for reporting positive
results for COVID-19, Flu A/B, and RSV.
• Consult the LIS for site-specific reporting guidelines.
1. PROTOCOL REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions for RNA extraction kit and Real-Time
PCR Diagnostic Panel.
• Biosafety protocols as outlined by the CDC and the WHO
guidelines.
• Local laboratory regulations and SOPs for infectious disease
testing.
1. LIMITATIONS
• False-negative results may occur if a specimen is improperly
collected, transported, or handled.
• The sensitivity and specificity of the test depend on compliance
with the procedure and the quality of the specimen and reagents.
1. DOCUMENTATION
Ensure complete and accurate documentation at all stages of the
analytical process. Retain all records for authorized inspection and
future reference as per laboratory record retention policies.
This SOP must be reviewed and updated regularly as deemed
necessary by laboratory management based on evolving guidelines
and technological advancements in the diagnostic field.
