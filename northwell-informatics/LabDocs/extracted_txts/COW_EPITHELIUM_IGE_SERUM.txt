Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for COW EPITHELIUM, IGE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
This protocol outlines the procedures for the analytical phase of
processing, testing, and generating results for Cow Epithelium-
specific Immunoglobulin E (IgE) in serum specimens. These
procedures ensure accuracy, consistency, and compliance with
relevant regulatory standards.
Responsibility:
Designated staff are responsible for the analytical preparation,
testing, and result documentation of Cow Epithelium-specific IgE in
serum specimens. It is the responsibility of all staff to adhere to these
procedures and report any deviations or issues to a supervisor
immediately.
2. SPECIMEN
Preferred/Acceptable Specimens:
• Serum collected in a plain red-top or serum separator tube (SST).
• Minimum volume: 0.5 mL; optimal volume: 1.0 mL.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens that are hemolyzed, lipemic or contaminated.
• Specimens collected in anticoagulant tubes (e.g., EDTA, heparin).
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Immunoassay analyzer (e.g., Phadia, Immulite)
• Centrifuge
• Calibrated pipettes
• Incubator
Reagents:
• Specific IgE assay reagents for Cow Epithelium (e.g.,
ImmunoCAP)
• Calibrators and controls for IgE assay
Supplies:
• Test tubes
• Pipette tips
• Sample cups
4. PROCEDURE
A) Sample Preparation:
1. Specimen Handling:
◦ Ensure specimen is properly labeled with patient’s name, ID
number, and collection date/time.
◦ Centrifuge the serum specimen at 1500-2000 g for 10-15
minutes to separate serum from clot.
◦ Transfer the clear serum to a new labeled tube using
calibrated pipettes.
2. Specimen Storage:
◦ Store specimens at 2-8°C until ready for analysis. Ensure
specimens are tested within 48 hours of collection.
◦ For specimens that must be stored longer, freeze at -20°C
or colder. Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
B) Assay Procedure:
1. Calibration:
◦ Perform a calibration check on the immunoassay analyzer
according to the manufacturer’s instructions using provided
calibrators.
◦ Document calibration results and ensure that all readings
fall within acceptable ranges.
2. Quality Control:
◦ Run quality control samples (low, medium, high levels) to
verify assay performance.
◦ Record QC data and verify that results are within acceptable
control limits.
◦ If QC fails, troubleshoot and repeat the process until
acceptable QC results are obtained.
3. Testing:
◦ Load prepared serum specimens into the immunoassay
analyzer according to the manufacturer’s operational
procedures.
◦ Initiate the assay run and monitor instrument performance
throughout the testing process.
C) Result Documentation and Reporting:
1. Result Verification:
◦ Review generated results for accuracy and consistency.
◦ Verify that all control and calibration results are acceptable
before validating patient results.
2. Data Entry:
◦ Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
with appropriate patient identification.
◦ Flag any critical results for immediate review and action
according to laboratory policy.
3. Reporting:
◦ Report Cow Epithelium-specific IgE results in IU/mL
(International Units per Milliliter).
◦ Refer to site-specific reporting guidelines for detailed
instructions on result interpretation and communication.
5. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Immunoglobulin E Specific to Cow Epithelium (IgE):
• Negative: <0.35 IU/mL
• Borderline: 0.35-0.70 IU/mL
• Positive: >0.70 IU/mL
6. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the assay insert for specific limitations related to Cow
Epithelium-specific IgE testing. Note any potential for cross-reactivity
and interference from other substances.

8. QUALITY CONTROL
Material: Phadia - Specific IgE Controls (low, medium, high)
Storage: 2-8°C. Stable unopened until expiry date.
Procedure: Run QC samples with each new lot of specific IgE assay
reagents and document outcomes per laboratory guidelines.
Reporting results, sample integrity, and critical result handling should
follow specific lab protocols as applicable.
