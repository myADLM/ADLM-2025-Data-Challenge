STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP) Analytical Phase
of Generating Results for COXIELLA BURNETII (Q FEVER),
MOLECULAR DETECTION, PCR, BLOOD
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standard procedure for the molecular detection of
Coxiella burnetii (Q fever) using Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)
in blood specimens. This SOP ensures the accuracy and reliability of
test results through consistent laboratory practices.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for
performing the procedures as described and ensuring all steps
adhere to quality standards. They must document processes and
notify supervisors of any discrepancies or issues requiring corrective
action.
2. MATERIALS AND REAGENTS
Specimens:
• Whole blood collected in EDTA or ACD tubes.
• Specimens should be processed within 48 hours of collection and
stored at 2-8°C.
Equipment:
• Biosafety cabinet
• Microcentrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Thermocycler
• Micropipettes (10 µL, 100 µL, 1000 µL) and pipette tips
• PCR tube strips or plates
• PCR reagents and consumables
Reagents:
• DNA extraction kit (validated for blood specimens)
• PCR master mix (including Taq polymerase, MgCl2, dNTPs, and
buffer)
• Forward and reverse primers specific for Coxiella burnetii
• Positive control DNA (Coxiella burnetii genomic DNA)
• Negative control (nuclease-free water)
• 70% ethanol
• Molecular-grade water
3. PROCEDURE
A. DNA Extraction:
1. Label all tubes clearly with the specimen identification (ID)
numbers.
2. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for the DNA extraction
kit. The following is a generalized approach: a) Add the
specified volume of lysis buffer to 200 µL of whole blood in a
microcentrifuge tube. b) Incubate at room temperature for the
specified time. c) Add the binding buffer and ethanol, mix
thoroughly by vortexing. d) Transfer the mixture to a spin
column and centrifuge at the recommended speed and time. e)
Wash the column with the wash buffers provided in the kit,
ensuring ethanol is removed from the column. f) Elute the DNA
in the appropriate volume of elution buffer or molecular-grade
water.
B. PCR Preparation:
1. Set up a clean and sterile working environment in a designated
PCR setup area to prevent contamination. Wear gloves and use
aerosol-resistant pipette tips.
2. Prepare the PCR master mix according to the manufacturer's
instructions. A typical setup might include:
◦ 10 µL of 2X PCR master mix
◦ 1 µL each of forward and reverse primers (final
concentration usually between 0.1 to 0.5 µM)
◦ 2 µL of extracted DNA template
◦ Molecular-grade water to bring the total reaction volume to
20 µL.
3. Include a positive control reaction using purified Coxiella
burnetii DNA and a negative control reaction containing all
components except the template (using nuclease-free water
instead).
4. Aliquot the master mix into PCR tubes or a plate, ensuring even
distribution and proper identification of each reaction tube or
well.
5. Seal the tubes or plate properly to prevent evaporation and
contamination.
C. PCR Cycling Conditions:
1. Place the tubes or plate in the thermocycler and program the
following cycling conditions:
◦ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 2 minutes
◦ Denaturation: 95°C for 30 seconds
◦ Annealing: 55°C for 30 seconds (optimize as necessary for
the primers used)
◦ Extension: 72°C for 1 minute
◦ Number of cycles: 35-40 cycles
◦ Final extension: 72°C for 5 minutes
◦ Hold: 4°C
D. Post-PCR Analysis:
1. After PCR is completed, load the PCR products onto an
agarose gel (1-2%) stained with an appropriate DNA dye (e.g.,
ethidium bromide or a safer alternative like GelRed).
2. Run the gel electrophoresis at 100-120 volts until appropriate
separation of the DNA bands.
3. Visualize the gel under UV or blue light to detect amplification
products.
4. Compare the sample bands with the positive and negative
controls.
4. INTERPRETATION AND REPORTING RESULTS
Positive Result:
• The presence of a specific size amplicon corresponding to the
target gene of Coxiella burnetii indicates a positive result.
Negative Result:
• The absence of the target amplicon, and only non-specific bands
or no bands other than the ladder, indicates a negative result.
Invalid/Rejected Results:
• The presence of bands in the negative control or absence of
amplification in the positive control necessitates repeating the
test.
Reporting:
• Document all amplification results in the laboratory information
system (LIS).
• Report positive, negative, and invalid results according to the site-
specific reporting guidelines.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include appropriate positive and negative controls in each PCR
run to ensure assay performance.
• Use previously characterized samples to assess inter-run and
intra-run consistency periodically.
• Maintain a log of all controls and specimens processed, noting
any issues or corrective actions taken.

master mix.

Coxiella burnetii.
7. NOTES
Adherence to the described SOPs ensures the reliability of the PCR
analysis for Coxiella burnetii detection in blood specimens,
maintaining high standards of laboratory practice and result accuracy.
Regular review and updates to this SOP are required to incorporate
technological and procedural advancements in molecular
diagnostics.
