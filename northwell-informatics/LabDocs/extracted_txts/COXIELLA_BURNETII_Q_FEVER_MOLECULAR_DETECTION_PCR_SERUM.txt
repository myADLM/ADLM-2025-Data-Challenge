Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Coxiella burnetii (Q fever), Molecular
Detection by PCR, Serum
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the procedures for the molecular detection of
Coxiella burnetii, the causative agent of Q fever, in serum specimens
using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The purpose is to ensure
accurate and reliable detection and reporting of Coxiella burnetii DNA
in human serum samples.
1. SCOPE
This procedure covers the steps involved from the preparation of the
serum specimen to the generation of results for Coxiella burnetii
detection by PCR in the clinical laboratory.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory personnel to
adhere to this SOP, perform the PCR assay, maintain instrument
calibration, quality control, and ensure accurate documentation of
results. Supervisors must ensure all personnel are trained and
competent in performing this procedure.
1. DEFINITIONS
• PCR: Polymerase Chain Reaction, a technique used to amplify
and detect specific DNA sequences.
• Coxiella burnetii: The bacterial pathogen responsible for Q fever.
• Serum: The liquid part of blood obtained after clotting and
centrifugation.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
• Specimen type: Serum
• Collection: Blood must be collected in a serum separator tube
(SST) and allowed to clot. Centrifuge the tube to separate serum
from clot within 2 hours of collection.
• Volume: Minimum of 1 mL serum
• Storage: Serum specimens can be stored at 2-8°C for up to 72
hours before testing. For longer storage, aliquot serum and store
at -20°C or lower.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• PCR workstation
• Microcentrifuge tubes
• Pipettes and aerosol-resistant tips
• Real-Time PCR instrument
• PCR Master Mix (containing DNA polymerase, dNTPs, MgCl2,
buffer)
• Coxiella burnetii specific primers and probes
• Nuclease-free water
• Positive control (Coxiella burnetii DNA)
• Negative control (Nuclease-free water)
• DNA extraction kit
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation
1. Thaw serum specimens, positive control, and negative control
on ice.
2. Vortex the specimens and controls briefly and centrifuge to
collect contents at the bottom of the tubes.
B. DNA Extraction
1. Extract DNA from serum specimens using a DNA extraction kit
according to the manufacturer's instructions.
2. Include an extraction blank as a negative control to monitor for
contamination.
C. PCR Setup
1. Prepare the PCR Master Mix according to the manufacturer's
instructions, adding the primers and probes specific for Coxiella
burnetii.
2. Aliquot the Master Mix into PCR tubes or a PCR plate.
3. Add 5 µL of extracted DNA from specimens, positive control,
and negative control into the assigned wells.
4. Seal the PCR tubes or plate with appropriate sealing materials.
D. Amplification and Detection
1. Load the PCR tubes or plate into the Real-Time PCR
instrument.
2. Program the thermocycler with the following conditions:
◦ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 10 minutes
◦ Cycling (40 cycles):
▪ Denaturation: 95°C for 15 seconds
▪ Annealing/extension: 60°C for 1 minute
3. Start the run and ensure proper recording of data.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include positive and negative controls in each PCR run.
• Monitor amplification plot for any irregularities or contamination.
• Analyze the extraction blank to ensure absence of contamination.
1. RESULT INTERPRETATION
• Positive: Amplification detected in the sample with a cycle
threshold (Ct) value similar to the positive control, within specified
ranges.
• Negative: No amplification detected in the sample or Ct value
greater than the cut-off threshold indicating no Coxiella burnetii
DNA present.
• Invalid/Repeat: Amplification in the negative control or no
amplification in the positive control requires investigation and
repeat testing.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results are to be recorded and entered into the Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
• Positive results should be reported with proper documentation
and interpretation.
• Negative results should be documented and reported accordingly.
• Any repeat or invalid results must be resolved before final
reporting.

PCR instrument.

End of SOP
This standard operating procedure (SOP) ensures consistency and
reliability in the detection of Coxiella burnetii in serum specimens,
following defined protocols and quality controls measures.
