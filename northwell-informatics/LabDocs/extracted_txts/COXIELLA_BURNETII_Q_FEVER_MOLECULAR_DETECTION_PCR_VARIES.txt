Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Coxiella burnetii (Q Fever), Molecular
Detection, PCR
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for the molecular detection of Coxiella
burnetii (Q Fever) using Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) in order
to provide accurate and reliable test results.
1. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all designated laboratory personnel trained
in molecular diagnostic techniques for the detection of Coxiella
burnetii in clinical specimens including, but not limited to, blood,
tissue, and other body fluids.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
Laboratory personnel conducting the PCR assay for Coxiella burnetii
are responsible for adhering to this SOP to ensure accurate and
timely test results. Laboratory supervisors are responsible for
ensuring that personnel are trained and that competency
assessments are conducted regularly.
1. EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS
• PCR Workstation
• Microcentrifuge
• PCR Thermocycler
• Real-Time PCR Detection System
• Nucleic Acid Extraction Kits
• PCR Master Mix (including primers and probes specific for
Coxiella burnetii)
• Pipettes and pipette tips (filtered)
• PCR tubes/plates
• Vortex mixer
• Gloves, Lab Coat, and other Personal Protective Equipment
(PPE)
• Biological Safety Cabinet (BSC) Class II
1. SPECIMEN
Preferred specimens: Whole blood, serum, tissue, and other body
fluids suitably collected for Q fever testing. Specimens must have
been collected, received, and accessioned properly prior to molecular
testing.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Nucleic Acid Extraction:
1. Upon receiving the specimen, confirm specimen identity and
integrity.
2. Extract total nucleic acids from the specimen using a validated
nucleic acid extraction kit following manufacturer instructions.
3. Include extraction controls (both positive and negative) to
ensure the quality of the procedure.
4. Quantify and assess the purity of the extracted DNA/RNA using
a spectrophotometer or equivalent.
B. PCR Setup:
1. Prepare the PCR master mix according to the kit instructions,
including the specific primers and probes for Coxiella burnetii.
2. Aliquot the master mix into PCR tubes or plates.
3. Add the extracted nucleic acid template to each tube; ensure to
include a no-template control (NTC) and a positive control.
4. Seal tubes or plates to prevent contamination.
C. Amplification:
1. Place the PCR tubes or plates in the real-time PCR
thermocycler.
2. Program the thermocycler according to the validated PCR
protocol for Coxiella burnetii detection: typically including initial
denaturation at 95°C, followed by 40 cycles of denaturation,
annealing, and extension.
3. Ensure the real-time PCR system records the fluorescence
data at the appropriate points in the cycle.
D. Data Analysis:
1. Review the amplification plots and Ct values generated by the
real-time PCR system.
2. Determine the presence of Coxiella burnetii DNA based on the
Ct value and adherence to positive and negative control results.
3. Quality Control: Ensure that the controls (positive and negative)
have performed correctly. NTCs should show no amplification,
and positive controls should amplify within expected Ct ranges.
E. Reporting Results:
1. Record results of the PCR assay in the Laboratory Information
System (LIS), including specimen identifier, result status, and
control outcomes.
2. Report results as either "Positive" for Coxiella burnetii DNA,
"Negative," or "Indeterminate" if controls fail or if questionable
results are obtained.
3. If specimen results are indeterminate, notify the supervisor for
further investigation and consider re-testing the sample.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
5. Routinely run internal quality controls with each PCR batch to
confirm reagent and process integrity.
6. Participate in external quality assurance programs for additional
validation.
7. Implement routine calibration and maintenance of equipment as
per manufacturer guidelines.
8. REFERENCES
9. Manufacturer's instructions for nucleic acid extraction and PCR
assay.
10. Guidelines and recommendations from public health authorities
(e.g., CDC) related to Q fever testing and diagnostics.
11. COMPETENCY ASSESSMENT
12. Initial and ongoing training of laboratory personnel.
13. Annual competency assessments involving direct observation
of test performance, result interpretation, and knowledge of the
procedure.
This SOP remains in effect until superseded or revised. The
laboratory supervisor is responsible for ensuring that this SOP is
reviewed and updated as necessary.
