Standard Operating Procedure for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for CRAB, IGE, and SERUM
1. PURPOSE
To outline the protocols and procedures for generating reliable and
accurate results for C-Reactive Protein (CRP), Immunoglobulin E
(IgE), and Serum analysis. Ensuring the compliance with regulatory
standards and consistent data integrity.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing and
documenting all analytical procedures outlined in this SOP.
Laboratory supervisors hold the responsibility for ensuring adherence
to this protocol and managing any deviations.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
CRP (C-Reactive Protein):
• Specimen Type: Serum or plasma.
• Collection: Serum separator tube (SST) or heparinized plasma
tube.
• Stability: Room temperature for up to 24 hours, refrigerated
(2-8°C) for up to 7 days, or frozen (-20°C or below) for up to 1
month.
IgE (Immunoglobulin E):
• Specimen Type: Serum.
• Collection: SST.
• Stability: Room temperature for up to 24 hours, refrigerated for up
to 7 days, or frozen for up to 1 month.
Serum Analysis:
• Specimen Type: Serum.
• Collection: SST.
• Stability: Refrigerated for up to 7 days or frozen for longer
storage.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Automated Immunoassay Analyzer.
• CRP Test Kits.
• IgE Test Kits.
• General Chemistry Analyzers for Serum Analysis.
• Calibrators and Controls.
• Standard Laboratory Supplies (pipettes, tips, tubes, etc.).
Note: Refer to manufacturer instructions for specific lot and batch
considerations of reagents and controls.
1. PROCEDURE
A) CRP Analysis:
1. Calibrate the immunoassay analyzer.
2. Prepare reagents and specimens by following the specific kit
instructions.
3. Load samples, calibrators, and controls onto the immunoassay
analyzer.
4. Run the CRP assay according to the standard operational
procedure.
5. Document the results including the date, time, and technician
initials.
6. Review quality control results to ensure assay performance is
within acceptable limits.
B) IgE Analysis:
1. Prepare the analyzer and reagents as per the manufacturer’s
guidelines.
2. Aliquot serum samples, ensuring no bubbles are present.
3. Load samples together with relevant controls and calibrators.
4. Follow the automated protocol for IgE quantification.
5. Document all results, noting any deviations or observed issues.
6. Evaluate quality control data for consistency.
C) Serum Analysis:
1. Calibrate the general chemistry analyzer using standard
protocols.
2. Prepare reagents if not pre-prepared and ascertain they are
within their expiry dates.
3. Pipette serum samples into the designated sample cups or
tubes.
4. Reload the analyzer with all prepared specimens and controls.
5. Perform serum analysis as per analyzer’s instructions.
6. Record results, including the handling technician's initials, date,
and time.
7. Verify the quality controls meet the acceptable criteria.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Quality controls (high, medium, and low) must be run at the
beginning of each day, and whenever a new lot of reagents
is used.
◦ Document the control results in the laboratory log.
◦ Any quality control failures must be addressed immediately,
through re-analysis or consultation with the supervisor.
◦ Follow the specific analyzer’s QC module instructions.
9. TROUBLESHOOTING AND CORRECTIVE ACTION
◦ If any errors or deviations are detected, re-analysis of the
sample may be necessary.
◦ For instrument failure or reagent concerns, contact technical
support and record the issue in the log.
◦ Any out-of-range control results need thorough investigation
with corrective actions documented.
10. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ Results must be reviewed and verified by the technologist
before reporting.
◦ Critical or unexpected results should be brought to the
supervisor’s attention.
◦ Proper documentation and sign-off protocols need to be
followed as per laboratory guidelines.
11. REFERENCE INTERVALS AND CRITICAL VALUES
CRP:
• Standard reference range: <10 mg/L.
• Critical value: >100 mg/L (consult site-specific critical value
guidelines).
IgE:
• Reference Range: 0-100 IU/mL (may vary by specific assay
used).
• Critical value: Value dependent on clinical context.
Serum:
• Follow laboratory-specific reference ranges pertinent to each
analyte of interest.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
◦ Refer to the manufacturer's inserts for method-specific
limitations.
◦ Consider any interfering substances as described in the test
kit literature.
2. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s Instructions for Use (IFU) for CRP and IgE Test
Kits.
• Laboratory Quality Management System documents.
By following these detailed procedures, the integrity and reliability of
the test results for CRP, IgE, and general serum analysis are
maintained. Ensure all laboratory personnel are adequately trained
and familiar with the documentation processes.
