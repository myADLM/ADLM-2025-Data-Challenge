SOP for CRAB (Candida rugosa Acidic Base) IgG
Antibody Detection
1. PURPOSE
To establish a standard procedure for the detection and
quantification of CRAB IgG antibodies in patient serum
samples. This ensures consistent, accurate, and reliable
results.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel responsible
for performing the CRAB IgG antibody test in the serology/
immunology section of the laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
Laboratory technologists trained in serology/immunology testing
are responsible for performing the test and documenting
results. Supervisors are responsible for ensuring all
technologists are adequately trained and the procedure is
followed correctly.
4. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
• Microplate reader capable of reading absorbance at 450nm with a
reference wavelength of 620nm
• Automated or Manual ELISA washer
• Calibrated micropipettes (10µL to 1000µL) and tips
• Timer
• Vortex mixer
• Plate sealers
• 96-well microplates (ELISA plates)
1. REAGENTS
• CRAB IgG ELISA Kit
◦ CRAB antigen-coated microplates
◦ Anti-human IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (HRP)
◦ Substrate solution (TMB)
◦ Stop solution (1N H2SO4)
◦ Wash buffer (PBS-Tween)
◦ Sample diluent
◦ Control sera (negative and positive controls)
◦ Calibration standards
• Deionized water
1. SPECIMEN
• Preferred specimen: Serum
• Specimen collection: Blood should be drawn by venipuncture
following standard collection practices.
• Specimen handling: After collection, allow the blood to clot by
leaving it undisturbed at room temperature for 15-30 minutes.
Centrifuge the serum at 1000-1500 x g for 10 minutes. Transfer
the clear serum to a properly labeled secondary container.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run both positive and negative controls with each assay to
ensure the accuracy of results.
• Regularly calibrate the micropipettes according to the laboratory
maintenance schedule.
• Log all quality control results and corrective actions if the control
results fall outside the predetermined ranges.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation
• Dilute serum samples 1:100 in sample diluent.
B. Assay Setup
• Important: Bring all kit reagents and samples to room temperature
before use.
• Add 100µL of diluted sera, controls, and calibration standards to
the respective wells, in duplicate.
• Cover the plate with a plate sealer and incubate for 1 hour at
37°C.
C. Washing
• Wash the plate 3 times with 300µL of wash buffer per well after
incubation. Use an automated plate washer if available. Ensure
complete removal of liquid between washes to avoid cross-
contamination.
D. Conjugate Incubation
• Add 100µL of HRP-conjugated anti-IgG to each well.
• Cover with a new plate sealer and incubate for 30 minutes at
37°C.
E. Washing
• Repeat the wash step as described above.
F. Substrate Incubation
• Add 100µL of TMB substrate to each well.
• Incubate in the dark for 15-30 minutes at room temperature.
Observe the color development.
G. Stopping the Reaction
• Add 100µL of stop solution to each well. The blue color will
change to yellow.
H. Measurement
• Measure the absorbance at 450nm with a reference at 620nm
using a microplate reader within 30 minutes of adding the stop
solution.
1. RESULT INTERPRETATION AND REPORTING
• Calculation of Results
◦ Generate a standard curve by plotting the absorbance of each
calibration standard against the respective standard
concentration.
◦ Determine the concentration of CRAB IgG in the patient
samples using the standard curve.
• Reference Ranges
◦ Negative: <10 IU/mL
◦ Equivocal: 10-20 IU/mL
◦ Positive: >20 IU/mL
• Documentation
◦ Record all results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
including control results and patient sample results.
◦ Review and verify results as per laboratory protocol before
validation and reporting.
1. ACTION FOR OUT-OF-RANGE RESULTS
• If sample absorbance readings fall outside the highest or lowest
standard, repeat the test with appropriate dilutions.
• If control results are out of acceptable range, investigate potential
errors (e.g., reagent, procedural, equipment malfunction) and take
corrective action before rerunning the patient samples.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING COMMON PROBLEMS
• Leakage of Wells: Ensure plates are sealed properly during
incubation steps. Handle plates gently to avoid spillage.
• High Background: Ensure the wash steps are performed
thoroughly, and buffers are prepared correctly.
• Low Signal: Verify the conjugate and substrate are added
correctly, and ensure proper incubation times and temperatures.
