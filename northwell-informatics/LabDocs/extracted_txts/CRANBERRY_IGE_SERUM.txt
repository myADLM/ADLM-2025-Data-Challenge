STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP) Analytical Phase -
Generating Results for CRANBERRY, IGE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE:
To provide the procedure for the analysis and generation of results
for Cranberry IgE (Immunoglobulin E) in serum. This SOP ensures
accurate and timely analysis following all quality control guidelines.
1. SCOPE:
This procedure applies to the laboratory staff involved in the
immunoassay analysis of Cranberry IgE in serum samples.
1. RESPONSIBILITIES:
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the
analysis, ensuring quality control steps are followed, and maintaining
accurate documentation of all results.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS:
• Preferred Specimen: 2-5 mL of serum derived from blood
collected in a serum separator tube (SST).
• Stability: Samples should be processed and analyzed within 7
days if stored at 2-8°C, or within 30 days if stored at -20°C.
• Unacceptable Specimens: Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples,
and samples stored beyond stability limits.
1. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES:
• Immunoassay analyzer (e.g., Phadia 250 or an equivalent
instrument)
• Cranberry IgE immunoassay kit (Phadia or equivalent)
• Calibrators and controls provided with the immunoassay kit
• Micropipettes and sterile tips
• Vortex mixer
• Centrifuge
• Laboratory centrifuge tubes
1. REAGENTS:
• Cranberry IgE immunoassay kit components including reagents,
calibrators, and quality controls
• Deionized water
• Appropriate waste containers
1. PROCEDURE:
A) Sample Preparation:
◦ Centrifuge the serum separator tubes at 1500 rpm for 10
minutes to obtain a clear serum sample.
◦ Carefully transfer the serum to a labeled 2mL
microcentrifuge tube without disturbing the cell layer.
B) Instrument Setup and Calibration:
◦ Turn on the immunoassay analyzer and perform a system
check as per the manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Load the Cranberry IgE immunoassay kit reagents into their
designated positions.
◦ Run calibrators provided in the immunoassay kit to ensure
the instrument is properly calibrated.
C) Sample and Reagent Loading:
◦ Load serum samples and quality controls into the
appropriate sample racks.
◦ Ensure the samples, reagent rack, and controls are placed
correctly in the analyzer.
D) Running the Assay:
◦ Select the appropriate assay protocol for Cranberry IgE on
the instrument interface.
◦ Verify all information and start the assay run.
E) Post-Analysis:
◦ Once the run is complete, verify the results and ensure
quality control parameters are within acceptable limits.
◦ Document any flagged results or errors that require re-
assay.
2. QUALITY CONTROL:
• Run positive, negative, and blank controls with each batch of
patient samples.
• Ensure control values fall within the specified ranges provided by
the manufacturer’s kit insert.
• Document and investigate any deviations or failures in control
results before reporting patient results.
1. REPORTING RESULTS:
• Review the generated results for each patient and verify that all
quality control criteria have been met.
• Report results following site-specific reporting guidelines.
• Use predefined reference intervals for Cranberry IgE (e.g., 0-0.35
kU/L).
1. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS:
• Results are deemed acceptable if controls fall within the specified
ranges and patient results meet quality control standards.
• Anomalous results should be flagged and re-assayed if
necessary.
• Negative results are reported as <0.10 kU/L, borderline/equivocal
results as 0.10-0.35 kU/L, and positive results as >0.35 kU/L.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
Refer to the product insert for Cranberry IgE immunoassay kit for
limitations related to cross-reactivity, specificity, and potential
interference.
