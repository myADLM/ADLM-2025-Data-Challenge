Protocol for Analytical Phase of Generating Results for
CRAYFISH, IGE, SERUM
1. Purpose
The purpose of this protocol is to outline the procedures for the
analysis of Crayfish-specific Immunoglobulin E (IgE) in serum
samples, to ensure reliable and accurate results.
2. Scope
This protocol applies to all samples received in the lab for the
determination of crayfish-specific IgE levels using the designated
ELISA-based or chemiluminescent method.
3. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies
• Equipment:
◦ Automated Immunoassay Analyzer (e.g., ImmunoCAP, Phadia
250)
◦ Refrigerated centrifuge
◦ Pipettes (single-channel and multi-channel)
◦ Timer
• Reagents:
◦ Crayfish-specific IgE calibration set
◦ Specific IgE Assay Kit for Crayfish (including standards and
controls)
◦ Wash buffer
◦ Sample diluent
◦ Conjugate
◦ Substrate solution
◦ Stop solution
• Supplies:
◦ Serum sample collection tubes
◦ Polypropylene microcentrifuge tubes
◦ Microplates (if using a manual ELISA method)
◦ Gloves and lab safety equipment
4. Specimen Requirements and Stability
• Specimen Type: Serum
• Collection Instructions: Collect blood in a serum separator tube
(SST).
• Specimen Handling: Allow the blood to clot, then centrifuge
within 1 hour of collection at 1500xg for 10 minutes.
• Specimen Storage: Store serum samples at 2-8°C if analysis will
be done within 48 hours. If stored for more than 48 hours, keep at
-20°C or lower.
5. Procedure
A. Preparation
1. Ensure all reagents are at room temperature before use.
2. Prepare all necessary dilutions of samples, calibrators, and
controls according to kit instructions.
3. Power on the automated analyzer and perform a daily
calibration and quality control check as per the manufacturer’s
instructions.
B. Sample Analysis
1. Manual ELISA method:
◦ Add standards, controls, and serum samples into respective
wells of the microplate.
◦ Add sample diluent to each well and incubate as specified in
the kit insert.
◦ Wash the wells with wash buffer.
◦ Add conjugate to each well and incubate as specified.
◦ Wash the wells with wash buffer.
◦ Add substrate solution and incubate until color development.
◦ Add stop solution to halt the reaction.
◦ Read the optical density at the specified wavelength using a
microplate reader.
2. Automated Immunoassay Analyzer:
◦ Load serum samples, reagents, and calibrators onto the
analyzer.
◦ Select the Crayfish-specific IgE protocol on the analyzer
software.
◦ Start the analysis. The analyzer will automatically process
the samples, including dilution, reagent addition, incubation,
and measurement.
◦ Once analysis is complete, review and verify results on the
analyzer’s display or connected LIS.
C. Result Interpretation
• Compare the sample absorbance or signal to that of the
calibrators to determine the concentration of crayfish-specific IgE.
• Verify all results against the controls to ensure assay performance
is within acceptable limits.
• Interpret results based on laboratory-established reference
ranges or cut-offs provided in the assay kit insert.
6. Quality Control
• Include low, medium, and high-specific IgE control samples in
each run to validate assay performance.
• Control results must fall within the specified range as per the kit
insert.
• Any run failing to meet QC criteria should be repeated.
7. Reporting Results
• Results should be reviewed and validated by a qualified
technologist.
• Report the concentration of crayfish-specific IgE in kU/L (kilo units
per liter).
• Document any discrepancies or issues encountered during the
assay process in the laboratory log.
8. References
• Specific IgE Assay Kit Insert for detailed instructions on reagent
handling and assay procedure.
• Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines for
immunoassay performance.
• Manufacturer’s instructions and user manual for the automated
immunoassay analyzer.
This protocol ensures consistency, accuracy, and reliability in the
determination of crayfish-specific IgE levels in serum samples and
aligns with the standard operating procedures of a CLIA-certified
laboratory.
