1. PURPOSE
To accurately analyze and report results for the Creatine Disorders
Panel from plasma specimens, incorporating a standardized protocol
for handling, testing, and quality control, ensuring validity and
reproducibility of test results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all laboratory personnel to follow this protocol
when handling plasma specimens designated for the Creatine
Disorders Panel. Laboratory technologists must adhere to the
specified procedures to ensure accurate and reliable results.
Supervisors must ensure compliance and oversee that quality control
measures are strictly followed.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen Type:
• Preferred: Plasma collected in lithium heparin tubes.
Collection:
• Ensure proper blood collection technique to prevent hemolysis.
The tube should be filled completely and mixed thoroughly to
avoid clot formation.
Transport and Storage:
• Transport plasma specimens to the laboratory immediately on ice.
• Upon arrival, centrifuge at 1500 x g for 10 minutes at 4°C.
• Aliquot the plasma into a labeled transfer tube.
• Samples should be stored at -70°C until analysis.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed specimens.
• Specimens not stored as per guidelines.
• Improperly labeled specimens.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Analytical high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) or
tandem mass spectrometer (LC-MS/MS).
• Heparinized tubes for plasma collection.
• Centrifuge capable of maintaining 4°C.
• -70°C Freezer for sample storage.
• Reagents for creatine, guanidinoacetate, and creatinine
quantification.
• Calibration standards and quality controls (QC).
5. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation:
1. Thaw plasma specimens at room temperature.
2. Vortex to ensure homogeneity.
3. Pipette the required volume of plasma into a new labeled
microtube.
B. Calibration and Controls:
1. Prepare calibration standards ranging from low to high
concentrations.
2. Include appropriate QC samples to cover expected
concentration ranges in patient samples.
3. Ensure all standards and QCs are prepared in a similar matrix
as patient specimens.
C. Instrument Setup:
1. Calibrate the HPLC or LC-MS/MS system according to the
manufacturer’s instructions using prepared standards.
2. Document all calibration data.
3. Perform a QC check to verify the system's accuracy and
precision before running patient samples.
D. Sample Analysis:
1. Load the prepared samples, standards, and QC materials onto
the HPLC or LC-MS/MS system.
2. Run the analysis according to the instrument’s protocol for
creatine, guanidinoacetate, and creatinine measurements.
3. Record and monitor all parameters during the run.
E. Data Analysis and Calculation:
1. Retrieve raw data and integrate peaks to determine
concentrations of analytes.
2. Compare sample concentrations to the calibration curve.
3. Confirm that QC results are within acceptable limits before
reporting patient results.
6. QUALITY CONTROL:
• Run QC samples at the beginning, middle, and end of the batch.
• Review QC results to ensure they fall within the established
acceptable ranges.
• If QC results fall outside acceptable limits, investigate, resolve the
issue, and reanalyze affected samples.
7. REPORTING RESULTS:
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Review and verify results considering QC performance and
sample integrity.
• Report any critical or unexpected results to the appropriate
healthcare provider promptly.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
• Refer to the instrument manufacturer's product inserts and the
clinical laboratory standards for limitations specific to the assay.
9. REFERENCES:
• Manufacturer’s instrument and reagent inserts.
• Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines.
This protocol ensures the consistent handling, processing, and
reporting of creatine disorder panel results in plasma, maintaining the
reliability and accuracy needed for effective patient care.
