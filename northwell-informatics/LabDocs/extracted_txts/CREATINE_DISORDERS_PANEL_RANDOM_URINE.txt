STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP)
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedure for the analysis
of the Creatine Disorders Panel in random urine specimens within the
laboratory. This includes the steps required to ensure accurate and
reliable results, as well as the necessary quality control measures.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
Laboratory technologists performing the test are responsible for
following this procedure. The laboratory supervisor must ensure all
personnel are trained and adhere to this SOP.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Analytical instrument (e.g., Liquid Chromatography-Mass
Spectroscopy (LC-MS) system)
• Traceable standard solutions for creatine, guanidinoacetate
(GAA), and creatinine
• Calibrators and quality control materials
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Urine collection containers
• Centrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Sample introduction and analysis software
• Laboratory Information System (LIS)
1. SPECIMEN HANDLING
• Preferable sample: 10-15 mL random urine specimen
• Specimen should arrive within 24 hours of collection.
• Specimens must be refrigerated if not tested immediately.
Unacceptable specimens:
• Specimens that are improperly labeled or without collection date/
time.
• Specimens contaminated with blood or feces.
1. PROCEDURE
2. Sample Preparation
a. Mix the urine specimen thoroughly by gentle inversion. b.
Pipette 1 mL of the urine sample into a labeled centrifuge tube.
c. Centrifuge the sample at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes to remove
particulates. d. Transfer the supernatant to a new tube for
analysis.
3. Calibration and Quality Control
a. Prepare the calibration standards and quality control (QC)
materials as per manufacturer instructions. b. Perform
calibration of the LC-MS system according to the manufacturer
protocol. Calibration should be done using at least 5 different
concentrations of creatine, GAA, and creatinine. c. Run QC
samples at two concentration levels (low and high) at the start
and end of each batch. d. Verify that the QC results are within
acceptable limits before proceeding with sample analysis.
4. Instrument Analysis
a. Program the instrument with the appropriate method
specifics for the Creatine Disorders Panel. b. Inject the
calibration standards, followed by the QC materials, and then
the patient samples. c. Ensure the analysis sequence includes
intermittent QC samples to monitor drift over time. d. For each
batch, run a blank sample to check for carry-over or
contamination.
5. Data Analysis and Interpretation
a. Ensure data acquired by the LC-MS is correctly processed
by the analysis software. b. Evaluate the chromatography
results to verify the separation and integrity of the peaks for
creatine, GAA, and creatinine. c. Ensure that the sample results
fall within the calibration curve range. d. If calibration or QC
results fall outside the acceptable range, troubleshoot the
instrument, reagents, or technique as needed and rerun the
analysis.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform and document QC every batch and whenever there is a
new shipment of reagents or instrument maintenance.
• Review and compare the QC results with established control
limits before reporting patient results.
• Maintain a log of all QC measures, calibration records, and
instrument maintenance.
• Perform bi-weekly and monthly intralab comparisons to ensure
consistency.
1. REPORTING RESULTS:
• Verify that all patient results fall within the validated range of the
assay.
• Enter results into the LIS, ensuring the data entry is accurate and
consistent.
• Inform the supervising technologist if any critical or unexpected
results are observed.
1. SAFETY PRECAUTIONS:
• Wear personal protective equipment (PPE) while handling
biological specimens and chemicals.
• Follow all laboratory safety protocols, including waste disposal
regulations.
1. REFERENCES:
• Manufacturer’s manual for LC-MS system.
• Relevant QC material and standard operating procedures.
• Laboratory safety and biosafety guidelines.
This SOP will be reviewed annually, and updates will be implemented
as required to align with best practices and regulatory standards.
