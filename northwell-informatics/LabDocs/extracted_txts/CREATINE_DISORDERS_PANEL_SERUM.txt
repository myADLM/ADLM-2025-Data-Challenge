Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Analytical Phase for
Generating Results for Creatine Disorders Panel, Serum
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the standardized procedure for generating results
for the Creatine Disorders Panel, Serum in order to ensure accurate
and reliable laboratory test outcomes for clinical diagnosis and
treatment.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the
assay following this SOP.
• Supervisors are responsible for overseeing the execution of the
protocol and ensuring corrective actions are taken when
necessary.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND ACCEPTABILITY
Specimen: Preferred: - 5 mL serum collected in a red-top tube or
serum separator tube (SST). - Ensure specimen is processed within
2 hours of collection to obtain serum.
Unacceptable:
- Specimens collected in tubes containing anticoagulants (e.g., EDTA, heparin).
- Serum specimens that are lipemic, hemolyzed, or showing microbial contamination.
- Specimens arriving in the laboratory more than 24 hours after collection without refrigeration.
Specimen Stability: - Serum kept at 2-8°C: stable for up to 48 hours. -
Frozen serum at -20°C or lower: stable for up to 30 days. - Avoid
repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
Note: If the serum specimen was refrigerated, bring to room
temperature before analysis.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Creatine Disorders Panel reagents and controls (follow
manufacturer’s guidelines for storage and preparation).
• Calibrators for serum creatine analysis.
• Automated biochemistry analyzer or mass spectrometer suitable
for analysis of creatine-related metabolites.
• Micropipettes and disposable tips.
• Centrifuge.
• Personal protective equipment (PPE).
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preliminary Steps:
• Ensure all equipment, including analyzers, are calibrated and
functioning properly according to manufacturer guidelines.
• Prepare reagents, calibrators, and controls as per instructions.
• Ensure the temperature and humidity of the laboratory are within
acceptable limits.
B. Sample Preparation:
• Allow frozen serum specimens to thaw completely at room
temperature.
• Mix serum samples gently to ensure homogeneity before
aliquoting for analysis.
C. Assay Procedure:
1. Set up the automated biochemistry analyzer or mass
spectrometer for Creatine Disorders Panel.
2. Load serum specimens, calibrators, and quality control
materials into the analyzer.
3. Follow the specific assay instructions provided by the reagent
manufacturer, including procedural timelines and quality control
protocols.
4. Start the analysis.
D. Data Collection:
• Review analyzer-generated data for each specimen.
• Ensure all control materials fall within acceptable ranges for
quality assurance.
E. Troubleshooting:
• If initial results fall outside acceptable ranges or indicate potential
issues, repeat the assay using the same or additional aliquots.
• Implement corrective actions such as recalibrating equipment,
checking reagent and sample integrity, or consulting with a
supervisor.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include low, medium, and high-level controls in each assay run.
• Record control results to ensure all fall within predefined
acceptable ranges.
• Perform periodic instrument validation and comparison studies as
required.
• Report and address any deviations from the control limits
according to lab protocols.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Verify all results generated by the analyzer and ensure they fall
within acceptable analytical ranges.
• Transmit results to the Laboratory Information System (LIS) for
review and verification.
• Use standard reporting formats and include comments where
necessary (e.g., sample quality issues).
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's instructions for Creatine Disorders Panel reagents
and analyzers.
• Internal quality control guidelines.
• Relevant clinical literature on creatine disorders and serum
analysis.
All laboratory staff involved in generating results for the Creatine
Disorders Panel, Serum should be familiar with and follow this SOP
to maintain the integrity of laboratory results and ensure patient
safety.
