Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical
Phase of Generating Results for Creatine Kinase (CK),
Serum
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for the accurate and consistent
measurement of Creatine Kinase (CK) in serum samples using
automated analyzers, ensuring reliable and reproducible results for
diagnostic purposes.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of authorized laboratory personnel to perform
the CK assay according to the defined procedures in this SOP,
including calibration, quality control, troubleshooting, and
documentation.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred Specimen:
• Serum collected in a plain red-top tube or serum separator tube
(SST).
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens collected in tubes containing anticoagulants such as
EDTA, citrate, or fluoride/oxalate.
• Hemolyzed specimens.
• Specimens received more than 24 hours after collection without
proper refrigeration.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Automated biochemistry analyzer (e.g., Roche Cobas, Beckman
Coulter AU, or equivalent).
• Refrigerated centrifuge.
• Pipettes and tips.
Reagents:
• CK reagent kit specific to the analyzer being used.
• Calibrators and controls.
• Deionized water.
Supplies:
• Serum collection tubes.
• Disposable gloves.
• Log sheets for manual documentation.
5. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Centrifugation: Centrifuge serum tubes at 1,500 to 2,000 x g
for 10 minutes.
2. Specimen Handling: Transfer the serum into a properly
labeled secondary tube.
3. Storage: If analysis cannot be performed immediately, store
serum samples at 2-8°C and analyze within 24 hours.
Performing the CK Assay:
1. System Setup:
◦ Ensure the analyzer is properly calibrated and all
maintenance procedures have been performed.
◦ Load CK reagent kit into the analyzer according to
manufacturer instructions.
2. Calibration:
◦ Calibrate the analyzer using CK calibrators provided with
the reagent kit.
◦ Run calibration checks and ensure calibration curve results
fall within acceptable ranges. Document calibration results.
3. Quality Control (QC):
◦ Run QC samples (negative and positive controls) before
and after patient sample analysis.
◦ Verify that QC results fall within acceptable limits. If QC
results are out of range, troubleshoot according to
manufacturer guidelines and repeat QC.
◦ Document all QC results in the log sheet.
4. Sample Analysis:
◦ Load patient serum samples into designated racks in the
analyzer.
◦ Enter patient identification and test parameters into the
analyzer's software.
◦ Initiate the analysis according to analyzer instructions.
◦ Monitor the analysis process and ensure no error messages
appear during the run.
◦ Once the analysis is complete, verify and print results.
Post-analysis:
1. Result Review:
◦ Review analyzer printout for any flagged results or error
messages.
◦ If applicable, manually check suspicious results by repeat
analysis.
2. Result Documentation:
◦ Record CK results in the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
◦ Document any incidents, corrective actions, or repeat
testing in the logbook.
3. Reporting:
◦ Verify results and ensure proper documentation in the LIS.
Troubleshooting:
1. Out-of-Range Results:
◦ Re-run the specimen.
◦ Review and verify analyzer maintenance logs.
◦ Check reagent integrity and expiration dates.
◦ Consult technical support if issues persist.
6. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s user manual for specific automated biochemistry
analyzers.
• CK reagent kit package insert for detailed reagent and procedure
information.
• Internal laboratory protocols for calibration and QC.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run QC samples with each new batch of reagents.
• Document all QC results and investigate any out-of-range values.
• Calibrate the analyzer as specified by the manufacturer and verify
calibration efficiency.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results are automatically transmitted to the LIS and must be
reviewed for accuracy by the technologist.
• Ensure critical values are promptly communicated to the relevant
healthcare provider.
• Use site-specific reporting guidelines for result entry into patient
records.
9. SAFETY AND WASTE DISPOSAL
• Wear appropriate laboratory PPE (lab coat, gloves, goggles).
• Dispose of biohazard waste according to safety regulations.
• Handle all reagents and specimens following biosafety guidelines.
By following this SOP, laboratory personnel can ensure precision,
accuracy, and reliability in the analysis and reporting of Creatine
Kinase (CK), serum results.
