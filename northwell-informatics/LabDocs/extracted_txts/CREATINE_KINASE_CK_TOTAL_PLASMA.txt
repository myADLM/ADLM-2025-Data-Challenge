Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Creatine Kinase (CK), Total, Plasma
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedure for the analysis
of total Creatine Kinase (CK) in plasma samples as part of clinical
diagnostics in a CLIA-certified laboratory.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of trained medical laboratory scientists to
perform the test as outlined in this SOP, ensuring accuracy and
reliability of results. All staff are responsible for reporting any issues
or deviations from the protocol to a supervisor.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type: Plasma Preferred Anticoagulant: Lithium heparin
(green top tube) or EDTA (lavender top tube) Volume: At least 1 mL
of plasma Storage: Refrigerated at 2-8°C if not analyzed within 4
hours; stable for up to 48 hours. For longer storage, freeze at -20°C
or colder.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Laboratory bench and appropriate safety equipment (PPE: lab
coat, gloves, face shield)
• Centrifuge
• Plasma separator tubes (PST)
• Automated chemistry analyzer capable of measuring CK (e.g.,
Roche Cobas, Beckman Coulter AU)
• CK reagent kit (commercially available)
• Calibrators and quality control materials (low, normal, and high
levels)
• Pipettes and tips
• Deionized water (DI water)
• Logbook for recording temperatures, reagent lot numbers,
calibrations, etc.
1. PROCEDURE
5.1 Sample Preparation
• Centrifuge collected blood samples at 1500-2000 x g for 10
minutes to separate plasma.
• Carefully transfer the plasma to a clean, labeled secondary tube
avoiding any cells or debris.
• Ensure the centrifuged samples are processed as per the
recommended storage instructions.
5.2 Calibration and Quality Control
• Prepare the analyzer by running the required calibration using
manufactured provided calibrators.
• Perform daily quality control checks using both low, normal, and
high control materials.
• Document QC results in the logbook and verify they fall within the
acceptable range before proceeding to patient samples.
5.3 Instrument Setup
• Configure the chemistry analyzer with the CK reagent kit
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
• Check that the instrument is within operational limits and that all
necessary reagents and consumables are loaded.
5.4 Running Patient Samples
• Load the prepared plasma samples into the analyzer’s carousel or
designated sample holder.
• Input sample identifiers into the analyzer software.
• Start the analysis, ensuring the correct test (CK, Total) is selected.
5.5 Analytical Process
• The analyzer will automatically perform the reaction and measure
CK activity in the plasma samples.
• Ensure that the enzyme reactions and subsequent readings are
free from any interference as per reagent and instrument specs.
5.6 Documentation and Reporting
• Review the analyzer output to ensure all results are within the
linearity range and flag any outliers for further review.
• Document results in the laboratory information system (LIS).
• Verify and release results in accordance with laboratory
procedures, ensuring critical values are promptly communicated
to the appropriate healthcare provider.
1. QUALITY CONTROL AND RECALIBRATION
• If QC results fall outside the acceptable range, troubleshoot
according to the instrument’s manual and repeat QC.
• Recalibration of the analyzer should be performed if calibration
drift or instrument error is detected.
• Record all recalibrations, maintenance, and repair activities in the
instrument logbook.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Reference intervals for CK, Total (assay-specific):
• Adult Males: 40 - 200 U/L
• Adult Females: 35 - 150 U/L
• Reference ranges may vary slightly based on the population and
assay used; refer to reagent insert for specific data.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolyzed samples can falsely elevate CK results due to the
release of CK from red blood cells.
• Samples with significant lipemia or icterus may cause
interference; additional procedures may be required to clarify the
results.
• Refer to reagent and instrument inserts for detailed limitations and
interferences.

By following this SOP, the laboratory staff ensure that the analysis of
CK in plasma is performed consistently and accurately, yielding
reliable results for patient diagnosis and management.
