Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Creatine Kinase MB (CK-MB), Plasma
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the measurement of plasma
CK-MB levels to ensure accuracy and reliability of reported results.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all personnel involved in the analysis of plasma
CK-MB in the clinical laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITIES
It is the responsibility of all designated laboratory personnel to
perform the procedures accurately and according to this SOP. Any
deviations or issues must be reported to the laboratory supervisor
immediately.
4. DEFINITIONS
CK-MB: Creatine Kinase MB, an isoenzyme of creatine kinase found
primarily in cardiac muscle cells. Plasma: The liquid component of
blood obtained by centrifuging whole blood with anticoagulant.
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
a. Specimen Type: Plasma (EDTA or heparinized)
b. Volume: Minimum 0.5 mL
c. Storage: Plasma should be separated from cells within 2 hours of collection. Store at 2-8°C if analysis is delayed for up to 48 hours or freeze at -20°C for longer periods.
6. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
1. Clinical chemistry analyzer (compatible with CK-MB assays,
e.g., Roche Cobas, Beckman Coulter DxC)
2. CK-MB reagent kits (compatible with the clinical chemistry
analyzer)
3. Calibrators and controls
4. Micropipettes and tips
5. Centrifuge
6. Refrigerated storage
7. Biohazard waste disposal container
8. Personal protective equipment (PPE)
7. PROCEDURE
a. **Preparation of Specimen**
1. Mix the plasma specimen thoroughly by gentle inversion before testing.
2. If the specimen is stored frozen, allow it to thaw completely and mix well before analysis.
b. **Instrument Setup**
1. Turn on the clinical chemistry analyzer and allow it to warm up to the operating temperature.
2. Ensure that all instrument maintenance and calibration checks are performed as per the manufacturer’s instructions.
c. **Calibration and Quality Control**
1. Prepare and run calibrators following the manufacturer's instructions.
2. Ensure that calibration curves are appropriately established.
3. Run quality control samples at two levels (normal and abnormal) each shift or according to laboratory policy. Record the results.
4. Verify that QC results fall within the acceptable range before proceeding with patient samples. Investigate and resolve any QC failures.
d. **Sample Analysis**
1. Load the CK-MB reagent into the clinical chemistry analyzer as per manufacturer's instructions.
2. Place the plasma specimens onto the sample rack.
3. Program the analyzer with the sample identification numbers.
4. Start the analysis run.
5. Monitor the instrument for any errors or alerts during the run.
e. **Result Interpretation**
1. Upon completion of the analysis, the instrument will generate CK-MB results.
2. Review the results ensuring that QC values meet acceptable criteria.
3. Flag any results that fall outside the reference ranges or show significant deviations.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
a. Record results in the laboratory information system (LIS).
b. Verify and release the results according to laboratory procedures.
c. Notify the attending physician immediately in case of critical values per laboratory’s critical value reporting policy.
9. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Reference intervals should be established based on the specific
population and analyzer used. Refer to the reagent kit insert for
guidance.
10. QUALITY CONTROL
a. Perform QC as described above.
b. Participate in external proficiency testing programs.
c. Document and review QC results regularly to ensure ongoing assay performance.
11. TROUBLESHOOTING
a. Refer to the manufacturer’s troubleshooting guide for any instrument-specific issues.
b. Re-run samples if QC failures or instrument errors are observed.
c. Document any problems and corrective actions taken.
12. REFERENCES
a. Manufacturer's instructions for CK-MB reagent kit and clinical chemistry analyzer.
b. Laboratory internal QC and maintenance logs.
c. Relevant clinical guidelines and publications.
13. DOCUMENTATION
Ensure all records of sample analysis, QC results, calibrations, and
maintenance logs are properly documented and maintained for
regulatory and quality assurance purposes.
14. REVIEW
This SOP should be reviewed and updated annually or whenever
there are changes in equipment, reagents, or procedures.
