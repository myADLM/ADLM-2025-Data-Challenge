Protocol for the Analytical Phase of Generating Results
for Creatine, Serum Referral Laboratory
1. PURPOSE To outline the procedures for the accurate and
efficient analysis of serum creatine levels in the referral
laboratory.
2. RESPONSIBILITY It is the responsibility of the designated
laboratory personnel to perform the serum creatine analysis
and ensure quality control standards are maintained.
3. DEFINITION This SOP defines the steps necessary for the
preparation, analysis, and reporting of serum creatine levels.
4. SPECIMEN A. Preferred/Acceptable: Serum obtained from a
blood sample collected in a plain red-top or serum separator
tube (SST), centrifuged within 2 hours of collection. B.
Unacceptable: - Hemolyzed samples. - Samples that have not
been separated within 2 hours of collection. - Specimens
collected in anticoagulant tubes (i.e., EDTA, heparin, citrate).
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
◦ Centrifuge
◦ Serum separator tubes (SST)
◦ Automated Chemistry Analyzer (calibrated and validated for
creatine analysis)
◦ Quality control material for creatine reference testing
◦ Pipettes and tips
◦ Laboratory timer
◦ Specimen storage refrigerator (2-8°C)
◦ Creatine reagent kits (store according to manufacturer’s
instructions)
6. PROCEDURE A. Preparation and Specimen Handling: 1.
Ensure that the specimen has been centrifuged and the serum
separated from the cells. 2. Store serum samples at 2-8°C if not
analyzed immediately. If analysis will be delayed more than 48
hours, freeze serum at -20°C.
B. Sample Analysis: 1. Initial Instrument Preparation: -
Ensure that the chemistry analyzer is properly calibrated using
the creatine calibration standards. - Run the daily calibration
and quality control checks as per the manufacturer's guidelines.
2. **Loading Specimens:**
- Label all specimens clearly with patient identifiers.
- Load the serum specimens into the designated sample cups or racks according to instrument specifications.
- Place the samples in the analyzer in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions.
3. **Running the Analysis:**
- Select the creatine assay from the instrument menu.
- Ensure that the system is set to run the appropriate number of replicates for each sample.
- Start the assay run.
- Monitor the analyzer to ensure that there are no issues during the run (such as clogs, errors, or alerts).
4. **Post-Analysis Procedures:**
- Once the run is completed, review the sample data for any flagged results that may indicate an error.
- Validate results against quality controls and standards to ensure accuracy.
- Document any deviations or errors in the analysis and take appropriate corrective actions.
C. Quality Control: - Include at least two levels of creatine
quality control material with each run. - Verify that the QC
results are within the acceptable range before validating patient
results. - Document all QC results, any corrective action taken,
and re-run samples if necessary.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ Review and validate the results in the laboratory information
system (LIS).
◦ Ensure that any critical values are immediately
communicated to the referring clinician as per laboratory
protocol.
◦ Generate and distribute reports that include patient
identifiers, creatine levels, reference intervals, and any
pertinent comments.
8. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Adult Male: 0.74 - 1.35 mg/dL (65 - 120 µmol/L)
• Adult Female: 0.59 - 1.04 mg/dL (50 - 93 µmol/L)
• Note: Reference intervals can vary based on the demographic
and specific clinical setting. Always refer to the laboratory-specific
reference.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS Refer to the manufacturer's package
inserts for the creatine reagent kits for any limitations related to
hemolysis, lipemia, and other interfering substances.
2. REFERENCES
◦ Manufacturer’s instructions and product inserts for the
creatine reagent.
◦ Laboratory quality control and standard operating
procedures.
By following this SOP, the laboratory ensures consistent, accurate,
and reliable results in the analysis of serum creatine levels,
maintaining the highest standards of laboratory practice.
