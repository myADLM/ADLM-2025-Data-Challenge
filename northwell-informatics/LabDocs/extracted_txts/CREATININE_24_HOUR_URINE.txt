Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for CREATININE, 24 HOUR, URINE
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the steps and procedures
required for the analytical phase of measuring creatinine levels in a
24-hour urine specimen and generating accurate and reliable test
results. This includes the responsibilities of laboratory staff, the
equipment and reagents required, the testing procedure, quality
control measures, and reporting results.
1. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel performing creatinine
testing on 24-hour urine specimens in the clinical laboratory setting.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing the
creatinine analysis according to this procedure. It is the responsibility
of all laboratory staff to ensure the accuracy and reliability of test
results and to address any issues that may arise during testing. The
laboratory supervisor is responsible for monitoring compliance with
this SOP and addressing any deviations or deficiencies.
1. DEFINITION
Creatinine is a waste product generated from muscle metabolism and
excreted by the kidneys. 24-hour urine creatinine testing is used to
evaluate kidney function and monitor certain medical conditions.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type: 24-hour urine collection. Specimen Volume: Ensure
at least 50 mL of the total 24-hour collection is submitted for analysis.
Specimen Storage: Store at 2-8°C if not analyzed immediately.
Specimens can be stable at room temperature for up to 24 hours.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Automated chemistry analyzer (e.g., Roche Cobas, Beckman
Coulter AU series)
• Creatinine reagent kit
• Calibrators and controls
• Urinalysis containers
• Micropipettes and tips
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
• Laboratory timer
• Disposable gloves
1. PROCEDURE
A) Preliminary Steps
1. Wear appropriate PPE, including gloves and lab coat.
2. Ensure that the urine specimen is properly labeled with the
patient's identification, collection date, and time.
3. Mix the 24-hour urine specimen thoroughly by gentle inversion.
B) Calibrators and Control Preparation
1. Prepare calibrators and controls according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Verify the calibration status of the analyzer and recalibrate if
necessary.
C) Testing Procedure
1. Load the creatinine reagent pack onto the chemistry analyzer.
2. Program the analyzer for the creatinine test according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
3. Aliquot an appropriate volume of the 24-hour urine specimen
(e.g., 100 µL) into a sample cup.
4. Place the sample cup in the designated position in the analyzer.
5. Start the analysis on the automated chemistry analyzer.
6. The analyzer will automatically mix the specimen with the
reagent, measure the absorbance, and calculate the creatinine
concentration.
D) Quality Control (QC)
1. Run QC samples (low, medium, high) at the start of each shift,
after calibration, and after any maintenance.
2. Verify QC results are within acceptable ranges before reporting
patient results.
3. Document QC results in the laboratory’s logbook or system.
4. CALCULATIONS
Urinary creatinine concentration (mg/dL) is provided by the analyzer.
To calculate the total creatinine excretion in 24 hours:
[ \text{Total creatinine (mg/24 hours)} = \text{Creatinine Concentration
(mg/dL)} \times \text{Total Volume (dL)}. ]
1. REPORTING RESULTS
2. Review the results and verify the accuracy and completeness of
the data.
3. If results are within the reference ranges and QC is acceptable,
report the results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
4. If results are outside reference ranges, perform necessary
troubleshooting steps and repeat the analysis if needed.
5. Document results according to site-specific guidelines.
6. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Reference values should be established based on the laboratory’s
patient population and guidelines from relevant medical
authorities.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Ensure that all urine samples are properly collected and stored. The
presence of interfering substances, improper specimen handling, or
technical issues with the analyzer may impact results.

1. REVIEW AND APPROVAL
This SOP is reviewed annually or as needed. Changes to the SOP
must be approved by the Laboratory Director or Supervisor.
