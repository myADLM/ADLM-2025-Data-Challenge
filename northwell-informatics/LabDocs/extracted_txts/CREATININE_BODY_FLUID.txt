Protocol for Analytical Phase: Determination of Creatinine in Body
Fluids
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to outline the standardized protocol
for the analysis of creatinine levels in body fluids (e.g., pleural fluid,
synovial fluid, peritoneal fluid). This ensures accuracy, precision, and
consistency in creatinine testing.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of laboratory personnel trained in biochemistry
analysis to perform and document this procedure. Supervisors are
responsible for ensuring all laboratory personnel are properly trained
and adhere to this protocol.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND ACCEPTABILITY
2.1 Specimen Collection:
• Preferred Specimen: Freshly collected body fluid in a sterile
container.
• Acceptable Specimen Volume: Minimum 1 mL.
• Specimen should be free from visible contamination (e.g., blood
clots, extreme hemolysis).
2.2 Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens received more than 24 hours post-collection without
proper refrigeration (2-8°C).
• Specimens with visible contaminants or significant hemolysis.
• Incorrectly labeled or unlabeled specimens.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Automated Chemistry Analyzer capable of measuring creatinine
levels.
• Creatinine reagent kits as per manufacturer’s instructions.
• Control material for quality control purposes (low, medium, and
high levels).
• Standard laboratory supplies, including pipettes, centrifuge, and
sterile containers.
1. PROCEDURE
4.1 Preparation:
• Verify specimen type, collection time, and labeling.
• Ensure the analyzer and reagents are properly calibrated and
prepare the instrument according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
• Perform a visual inspection of the sample for hemolysis, clotting,
or contamination before processing.
4.2 Specimen Handling:
• Centrifuge the body fluid at 2000-3000 RPM for 10 minutes to
obtain a clear supernatant.
• Transfer the supernatant to a new labeled container for testing.
4.3 Analysis:
• Load the specimen onto the chemistry analyzer.
• Select the appropriate test for creatinine, ensuring that the
analyzer settings are correct.
• Run the analysis according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
• Perform and document the quality control testing before patient
samples are run. Ensure all QC results are within acceptable
ranges.
4.4 Quality Control:
• Run internal quality control (QC) materials with each batch of
specimens.
• Document the QC results and ensure they meet the
predetermined acceptable ranges before releasing patient results.
• If QC results fall outside acceptable limits, troubleshoot according
to the analyzer’s instruction manual, re-calibrate if necessary, and
rerun QC.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
5.1 Review and Verification:
• Review the analyzer’s output to ensure results are within the
measurable range.
• Verify the results by comparing them against previous results if
available to check for consistency and plausibility.
5.2 Documentation:
• Record the results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
with all pertinent information (e.g., patient details, specimen type,
testing date, and time).
• Ensure any critical results are flagged and communicated to the
relevant healthcare provider following specific critical result
notification protocols.
• Document any discrepancies or corrective actions taken during
the testing process.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
As reference intervals for creatinine in body fluids can vary based on
the type of fluid and clinical context, refer to established laboratory-
specific reference ranges and clinical guidelines.
Reference Ranges:
• Pleural Fluid: Consult institutional reference range.
• Synovial Fluid: Consult institutional reference range.
• Peritoneal Fluid: Consult institutional reference range.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolysis, lipemia, and icterus can interfere with creatinine
measurements; address any technical issues as per the
manufacturer's recommendations.
• Specimen stability is critical. Ensure proper storage and handling
to avoid degradation.
• Analytical limitations specific to the equipment or reagent
manufacturers should be referred to in their documentation.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s Instruction Manual for the Chemistry Analyzer.
• Relevant CLSI (Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute)
guidelines.
• Laboratory's internal Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and
Quality Control documentation.
By adhering to this protocol, laboratory staff can ensure the accurate
and reliable determination of creatinine in body fluids, contributing to
effective patient diagnosis and treatment.
