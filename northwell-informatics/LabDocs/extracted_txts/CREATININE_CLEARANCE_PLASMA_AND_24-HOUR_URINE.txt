Standard Operating Procedure
Title: Analytical Phase Protocol for Creatinine Clearance, Plasma,
and 24-Hour Urine
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for processing, analyzing, and
reporting Creatinine Clearance using both plasma and 24-hour urine
specimens. This protocol ensures consistent, accurate, and reliable
results adhering to CLIA-certified laboratory standards.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all laboratory personnel to adhere to this
SOP:
• Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the
analysis.
• Supervisors must ensure the process is followed correctly and
any deviations are documented and corrective actions taken as
needed.
3. PRINCIPLE
Creatinine clearance is an indicator of renal function and is calculated
based on plasma and 24-hour urine creatinine levels as well as the
urine volume.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
A) Plasma Specimen:
• Preferred: Serum or plasma collected in a lithium heparin, EDTA,
or SST tube.
• Minimum volume: 1 mL.
B) 24-Hour Urine Specimen:
• Preferred: Complete 24-hour urine collection in a sterile container,
preserved if necessary as per laboratory protocol.
• Minimum volume: Entire 24-hour collection noted with exact total
volume.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Automated chemistry analyzers (e.g., Roche Cobas c501)
• Creatinine calibration material
• Quality control material (both high and low levels)
• Pipettes and tips
• Timer
• 24-hour urine containers
6. PROCEDURE
A) Specimen Preparation
1. Plasma:
◦ Centrifuge blood samples at 1500-2000 x g for 10 minutes.
◦ Carefully separate the plasma/serum from the cells and
transfer to a labeled secondary container if necessary.
2. 24-Hour Urine:
◦ Ensure the collection is complete, documented, and
properly labeled with patient information and total volume.
◦ Mix the urine sample thoroughly to ensure even distribution
of any particulates.
B) Analysis
1. Plasma/Serum Creatinine:
◦ Load the plasma/serum sample onto the automated
chemistry analyzer.
◦ Follow the instrument's instructions for creatinine analysis.
◦ Ensure that calibration and quality control procedures are
performed as per the analyzer's protocols.
◦ Record the plasma creatinine concentration.
2. Urine Creatinine:
◦ Dilute the urine sample if necessary following the analyzer's
guidelines.
◦ Load the urine sample onto the automated chemistry
analyzer.
◦ Follow the instrument's instructions for creatinine analysis.
◦ Record the urine creatinine concentration.
C) Calculations
1. Calculate Creatinine Clearance using the following formula:
Creatinine Clearance (mL/min) = (Urine Creatinine mg/dL) ×
(Urine Volume mL) / (Plasma Creatinine mg/dL) × (Time
minutes)
◦ Ensure correct conversion of units if needed to match the
formula requirements.
◦ Typically, 24-hour urine collection is converted to minutes
(e.g., 1440 minutes for 24 hours).
D) Quality Control
1. Run internal quality controls with each batch of plasma/serum
and urine samples.
2. Acceptable ranges should be predefined, and any deviations
should be investigated.
3. Document all QC results and any actions taken if results fall
outside the acceptable range.
E) Reporting Results
1. Review the raw data and calculations for accuracy.
2. Report the creatinine clearance values in the Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
3. Communicate critical values to the requesting physician as per
the laboratory's critical value policy.
7. REFERENCE VALUES
• Normal creatinine clearance values are typically 90-140 mL/min
for males and 80-130 mL/min for females but verify against
laboratory-specific references.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Ensure proper collection and handling of 24-hour urine to avoid
errors due to incomplete collection or improper preservation.
• Hemolysis or improper sample handling may affect plasma
creatinine results.
