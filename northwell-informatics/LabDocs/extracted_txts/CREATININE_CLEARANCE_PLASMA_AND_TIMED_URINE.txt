Standard Operating Procedure:
Analytical Phase of Generating
Results for CREATININE
CLEARANCE, PLASMA AND
TIMED URINE
1. PURPOSE
This procedure outlines the steps to analyze and generate results for
Creatinine Clearance from plasma and timed urine specimens in the
laboratory. Creatinine clearance is a measure of kidney function and
requires accurate and precise analytical methods to ensure reliable
results.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND
STABILITY
Plasma Specimen:
• Type: Lithium Heparin or SST (Serum Separator Tube)
• Volume: Minimum 1 mL plasma
• Stability:
◦ Refrigerated (2-8°C): Stable for 7 days
◦ Frozen (-20°C): Stable for 1 month
Timed Urine Specimen:
• Type: 24-hour urine collection
• Volume: Entire collection, at least 10 mL aliquot for testing
• Storage: Refrigerate during collection
• Stability:
◦ Refrigerated (2-8°C): Stable for 7 days
◦ Frozen (-20°C): Stable for 1 month
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Plasma samples that are hemolyzed or not properly labeled.
• Urine samples that were not collected over a 24-hour period or
without accurate timing records.
• Urine samples with pH outside the range 4.5-8.0.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND
SUPPLIES
• Automated chemistry analyzer (e.g., Roche/Beckman)
• Calibrators and Quality Control materials for Creatinine
• Reagent kits specific for plasma and urine creatinine
• Timer
• Calibrated pipettes
• Standard laboratory glassware and consumables
• Patient’s 24-hour urine container
4. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation
1. Labeling:
◦ Confirm that each collection container and plasma specimen
is properly labeled with patient ID, date, and time of
collection.
2. Urgent Samples:
◦ If the tests are marked as urgent, prioritize processing
accordingly.
B. Plasma Creatinine Analysis
1. Calibrate analyzer with appropriate calibration material.
2. Quality Control:
◦ Run high, low, and mid-level QC samples at the beginning
of the batch.
◦ Document results, ensuring they fall within acceptable
ranges before proceeding.
3. Sample Preparation:
◦ Centrifuge plasma specimens at 3500 rpm for 10 minutes
prior to analysis.
◦ Aliquot 500 µL of plasma into a clean tube.
4. Analyzer Parameters:
◦ Load the plasma sample into the analyzer using pre-set
parameters for creatinine.
◦ Ensure that the analyzer has run a successful calibration
and QC checks.
C. Urine Creatinine Analysis
1. Timed Urine Collection:
◦ Record the total volume of the 24-hour urine collection.
◦ Mix the urine collection well before aliquoting.
2. Aliquot Sample:
◦ Take a 10 mL aliquot of the urine sample for analysis.
3. Analyzer Preparation:
◦ Calibrate the chemistry analyzer using urine-specific
creatinine calibrators.
4. Quality Control:
◦ Run QC samples specific for urine creatinine analysis.
5. Analysis:
◦ Load the urine sample and run alongside the plasma
analysis, using urine specific assay parameters.
D. Calculation of Creatinine Clearance
1. Formula:
Creatinine Clearance (mL/min) = (Urine Creatinine (mg/dL) x
Urine Volume (mL)) / (Plasma Creatinine (mg/dL) x Time
(minutes))
2. Data Entry:
◦ Enter urine creatinine, total urine volume, and plasma
creatinine into the calculation formula.
◦ Perform calculations using laboratory software or manually if
required.
◦ Verify result calculations for accuracy.
E. Reporting Results
1. Documentation:
◦ Record all results in the laboratory information system (LIS).
◦ Verify results against expected reference ranges.
2. Results Verification:
◦ Ensure double-checking by a second technologist if the
results fall outside normal ranges.
3. Critical Results:
◦ Report critical creatinine clearance results immediately to
the responsible physician or healthcare provider according
to laboratory policy.
◦ Document notification actions in LIS.
5. QUALITY CONTROL AND RESULTS
INTERPRETATION
• Reference Intervals:
◦ Creatinine Clearance: 90-140 mL/min for males, 80-125 mL/
min for females
• QC should be run and documented daily. Any QC failures must be
investigated and resolved before patient results are reported.
• Each batch of tests should be paired with appropriate calibrations
and controls.
• Results must be cross-checked for consistency and any
discrepancies must be investigated promptly.
6. RECORD MAINTENANCE
Maintain detailed logs of:
• Calibration and QC results
• Daily operational logs of instruments
• Individual patient results with collection times
• Documentation of any issues and corrective actions taken
All logs should be reviewed by a supervisor periodically to ensure
compliance and accuracy.
