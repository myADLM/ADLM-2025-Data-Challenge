Standard Operating Procedure for Creatinine Clearance, Serum
and 24-Hour Urine
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this protocol is to ensure the accurate and reliable
determination of creatinine clearance by analyzing serum creatinine
and 24-hour urine creatinine.
1. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory staff who are responsible for
performing creatinine clearance tests.
1. RESPONSIBILITIES
Laboratory technologists/technicians are responsible for following this
SOP and documenting results appropriately. Supervisors are
responsible for ensuring adherence to this procedure and providing
necessary training and resources.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Serum Specimen:
◦ Preferred: Serum collected in a SST or plain red top tube.
◦ Volume: Minimum of 1 mL of serum.
24-Hour Urine Specimen:
◦ Collection: 24-hour urine collection with the entire volume
submitted.
◦ Volume: Minimum of 10 mL aliquot from the well-mixed total
collection.
◦ Preservation: No preservative needed if analyzed within 24
hours; otherwise, refrigeration may be necessary.
2. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Automated chemistry analyzer (e.g., Roche Cobas 6000,
Beckman Coulter AU680).
• Creatinine reagent kit for the selected analyzer.
• Calibrators and control materials for creatinine measurement.
• 1 mL pipettes and tips.
• Labeling materials.
• 24-hour urine containers.
• Personal protective equipment (PPE).
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation of Samples
1. Serum Sample Preparation:
▪ Allow the serum to clot at room temperature for at
least 30 minutes.
▪ Centrifuge at 1500-2000 g for 10 minutes to obtain a
clear supernatant.
▪ Transfer the serum to a labeled secondary tube.
2. 24-Hour Urine Sample Preparation:
▪ Mix the collected 24-hour urine thoroughly.
▪ Measure and record the total volume.
▪ Transfer a 10 mL aliquot of the mixed urine to a
labeled secondary tube.
B. Creatinine Measurement:
1. Serum Creatinine:
▪ Load the serum sample into the automated chemistry
analyzer following the manufacturer's instructions.
▪ Perform the creatinine assay as per the analyzer's
protocol.
2. Urine Creatinine:
▪ Load the 24-hour urine sample into the automated
chemistry analyzer following the manufacturer's
instructions.
▪ Perform the creatinine assay as per the analyzer's
protocol.
C. Calculation of Creatinine Clearance:
◦ Obtain the serum creatinine concentration (mg/dL).
◦ Obtain the urine creatinine concentration (mg/dL).
◦ Use the following formula to calculate creatinine clearance:
[ CCr = \left( \frac{\text{Urine creatinine in mg/dL} \times
\text{Urine volume in mL}}{\text{Serum creatinine in mg/dL}
\times \text{Time in minutes}} \right) \times 1.73 \div
\text{BSA} ]
◦ Note: Typically, the time is 1440 minutes for a 24-hour urine
collection.
◦ BSA (Body Surface Area) can be calculated using the
formula:
[ BSA (m^2) = \sqrt{ (\text{Height in cm} \times \text{Weight
in kg}) \div 3600 } ]
2. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Perform quality control procedures using low, medium, and
high control materials for creatinine at the beginning and
end of each shift.
◦ Ensure controls fall within the acceptable range according to
the manufacturer's specifications.
◦ Document and review all QC results before patient results
are released.
◦ In case of QC failure, do not report patient results until the
issue is resolved.
3. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ Verify and validate all results in the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
◦ Report the creatinine clearance result in mL/min/1.73 m^2.
◦ Add relevant comments if any sample integrity issues or
difficulties were encountered during the analytical phase.
4. REFERENCE INTERVALS
◦ Normal creatinine clearance (24-hour): 85-125 mL/min/1.73
m^2 for males; 75-115 mL/min/1.73 m^2 for females.
◦ Reference intervals may vary based on patient age and
laboratory-specific validations.
5. LIMITATIONS
• Hemolysis, lipemia, or icterus in serum samples may interfere
with creatinine measurements.
• Incomplete urine collection could affect accuracy; ensure
thorough patient instruction.
• Use standardized and validated methods/tools for urine collection
and serum separation.
