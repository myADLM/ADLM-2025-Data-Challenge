Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Analysis of Plasma Creatinine
1. PURPOSE
This procedure details the steps required to perform plasma
creatinine testing to ensure accurate and reliable results. It
encompasses the handling, processing, analysis, quality control, and
reporting of plasma creatinine results.
Responsibility:
All laboratory staff members involved in the handling, processing,
analyzing, reporting, and oversight of plasma creatinine testing must
adhere to this SOP to ensure consistency, accuracy, and compliance
with regulatory standards.
1. DEFINITION
Plasma creatinine testing involves quantifying the concentration of
creatinine in plasma to assess kidney function. Elevated levels of
creatinine may indicate impaired kidney function.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen Type: Plasma Acceptable Collection Container:
• PST (Plasma Separator Tube)
• Lithium Heparin collection tube
Specimen Handling:
• Specimens should be collected, transported, and processed
promptly according to accepted standards.
• Store plasma samples at 2-8°C if analysis is delayed, but analyze
within 24 hours.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Clotted specimens
• Hemolyzed specimens
• Specimens received in inappropriate containers (e.g., EDTA or
Citrate tubes)
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Calibrated automated chemistry analyzer (e.g., Roche Cobas c
311, Beckman Coulter AU480)
• Creatinine reagent kit specific to the instrument used
• Calibrators and controls
• Centrifuge (if required for plasma separation)
• Laboratory timer
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
1. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation
1. Verify that all equipment and reagents are within their
respective calibration and expiration date.
2. Calibrate the chemistry analyzer according to the
manufacturer's instructions if necessary.
B) Sample Loading and Analysis
1. Confirm the identity of the specimen using proper identifiers
against the laboratory requisition forms.
2. Centrifuge samples at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes to separate
plasma if using non-gel tubes.
3. Load the separated plasma specimens onto the chemistry
analyzer.
4. Select the creatinine test parameter on the analyzer.
5. Run the plasma creatinine test according to the analyzer's
operation protocol.
6. Ensure the instrument cycles include control materials to verify
the accuracy and precision of the assay before proceeding with
patient samples.
C) Quality Control
1. Run quality control samples—low, normal, and high—at the
start of each batch of tests, following shifts, and after reagent or
calibrator changes.
2. Ensure that control results fall within established acceptable
ranges. If results are outside acceptable limits, troubleshoot
and repeat controls before analyzing patient specimens.
3. Document all control results in the Quality Control Log.
D) Result Reporting
1. Review creatinine results for all patient specimens for accuracy.
2. Verify results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS) before
releasing.
3. Flag and document any critical results based on established
reference ranges and notify the appropriate healthcare provider
per the laboratory’s critical result notification policy.
4. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Adult (Males): 0.7 – 1.3 mg/dL (62 – 115 µmol/L) Adult (Females) 0.6
– 1.1 mg/dL (53 – 97 µmol/L) Pediatric reference intervals may vary
based on age and should refer to specific laboratory guidelines.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the reagent package insert for specific limitations, including:
• Interference from hemolysis, lipemia, icterus
• Effects of drugs or therapeutic agents that may alter creatinine
levels
