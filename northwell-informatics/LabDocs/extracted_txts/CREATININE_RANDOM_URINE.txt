Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analysis of
Creatinine, Random, Urine
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized and validated method for the analysis and
reporting of creatinine levels in random urine specimens.
Responsibility: All designated laboratory personnel are responsible
for performing the analysis, ensuring adherence to the SOP,
documenting results, and troubleshooting any discrepancies.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
◦ Specimen Type: Random urine.
◦ Specimen Volume: A minimum of 10 mL.
◦ Collection Container: Clean, dry, plastic urine collection
container with a secure cap.
◦ Storage and Stability:
▪ Specimens should be stored at 2-8°C for up to 24 hours
if delayed testing is anticipated.
▪ For long-term storage, aliquot into labeled tubes and
store at -20°C for up to one month.
2. UNACCEPTABLE SPECIMENS
◦ Specimens in unlabelled containers or without requisition
data.
◦ Contaminated, visibly hemolyzed, or insufficient volume
specimens.
◦ Specimens that have been improperly stored or delayed in
transport beyond specified stability times.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
◦ Equipment:
▪ Automated chemistry analyzer.
▪ Traceable temperature monitoring devices.
▪ Centrifuge.
▪ Vortex mixer (if needed).
◦ Reagents:
▪ Commercially available urine creatinine reagent kits.
▪ Calibrators and quality control materials (low, medium,
and high).
◦ Supplies:
▪ Pipettes and tips.
▪ Clean, disposable cuvettes/tubes.
▪ PPE (personal protective equipment) including lab coats,
gloves, and safety glasses.
4. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation:
◦ Turn on and calibrate the automated chemistry analyzer
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Ensure the creatinine reagent kit is at room temperature and
properly mixed.
◦ Prepare calibrators and quality control materials.
B. Sample Preparation:
◦ Mix urine specimens well before aliquoting to ensure
homogeneity.
◦ If the specimen appears turbid, centrifuge at 1500 rpm for
10 minutes and use the supernatant for analysis.
C. Analysis:
◦ Program the analyzer for urine creatinine analysis as per the
manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Run calibrators and quality control samples at the start of
each batch run, after instrument maintenance, when
changing reagent lots, and at least every 24 hours.
◦ Pipette the required volume of urine specimen into the
sample cups or directly into the analyzer sample racks.
◦ Load the samples into the analyzer.
◦ Start the run and monitor the process for any flags or errors.
D. Recording Results:
◦ Review calibration and quality control results to ensure they
are within acceptable ranges before reporting patient
results.
◦ Results out of range should be reassessed, and
troubleshooting steps followed according to the analyzer
manual and lab protocol.
◦ Document the creatinine results into the Laboratory
Information System (LIS) for review and verification.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Run and document quality control tests using both normal
and abnormal controls each day of testing.
◦ Ensure all quality control results fall within the established
acceptable range. Do not report patient results if QC results
are out of range.
◦ Investigate and resolve any quality control failures
immediately according to laboratory troubleshooting
protocols.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ Creatinine results should be recorded in mg/dL (or mmol/L
depending on regional preferences).
◦ Validation by the technologist is required before results are
released to the clinician.
◦ Any critical values must be immediately communicated to
the requesting physician or appropriate clinical staff, and the
communication should be documented.
7. REFERENCE INTERVALS
◦ Typical reference interval for creatinine in random urine:
▪ Men: 20-370 mg/dL
▪ Women: 20-320 mg/dL
◦ Note: Reference intervals may vary by institution and should
be compared against local population data if available.
8. TROUBLESHOOTING
◦ Consult the analyzer’s manual for specific error codes and
troubleshooting steps.
◦ Check reagent and control expiration dates regularly to
prevent out-of-date usage.
◦ Perform preventive maintenance as per the analyzer
manufacturer’s schedule.
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Samples with extreme pH or very dilute/concentrated urine may
affect the accuracy of results.
• Refer to the reagent kit insert for specific limitations and
interferences.

• The reagent kit insert and analyzer user manual for detailed
instructions and troubleshooting guides.
