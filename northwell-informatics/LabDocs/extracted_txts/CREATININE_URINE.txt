Standard Operating Procedure for the Analysis of Creatinine,
Urine
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to outline the laboratory protocol for
analyzing creatinine levels in urine specimens. This procedure
ensures accurate and consistent results are generated utilizing
specified analytical instruments and methods.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of the laboratory technologist to follow the
procedure as outlined to ensure the accurate analysis of creatinine in
urine specimens. The supervisor is responsible for overseeing the
adherence to this protocol and for resolving any discrepancies or
issues that arise during the process.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Analyzing instrument: Automated chemistry analyzer (e.g.,
Beckman Coulter AU5800)
• Creatinine reagent kit
• Calibrators
• Quality control materials (high and low control)
• Personal protective equipment (gloves, lab coat, safety glasses)
1. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Requirements:
• Minimum volume: 10 mL of urine.
• Acceptable specimen types: Random, 24-hour collection.
• Storage: Refrigerate if analysis cannot be immediately performed.
Specimens are stable at 4°C for up to 7 days.
B. Preparation of Reagents:
• Prepare the creatinine working reagent according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
• Calibrate the instrument using the specified calibrators following
the analyzer's protocol.
C. Quality Control:
• Run high and low quality control (QC) samples at the start of each
shift, after calibration, and with each new batch of reagent.
Controls must fall within the acceptable range before patient
samples are analyzed.
• Document QC results in the appropriate logbook or electronically
as applicable.
D. Sample Analysis:
1. Loading Samples:
◦ Mix urinary specimens by gently inverting the container
several times.
◦ Ensure samples are properly labeled with at least two
patient identifiers (e.g. name, date of birth).
◦ Load specimens into the automated chemistry analyzer.
2. Running Assay:
◦ Select the creatinine assay on the instrument.
◦ Follow the analyzer's specific procedural prompts to initiate
the assay.
3. Automated Analysis:
◦ The analyzer will aspirate the specimen, mix it with the
creatinine reagent, and measure the absorbance change
indicating creatinine concentration.
◦ Review results on the analyzer's display.
E. Review of Results:
• Verify results for normal and critical values.
• Compare patient results against standard reference intervals for
urine creatinine (e.g., 20-370 mg/dL).
• Investigate any flagged results or values that are outside the
expected range. Repeat analysis if necessary.
1. REPORTING RESULTS:
• Validated results must be transmitted to the Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
• Document any occurrences of errors with specimen analysis,
including the nature of the error and the corrective actions taken.
• Critical values must be communicated to the relevant healthcare
provider immediately following the institution's critical value
protocol. Document communication according to lab policy.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS:
• Reference intervals may vary with the patient’s age, sex, and
clinical condition. Example reference interval for random urine:
20-370 mg/dL.
• Always refer to the most up-to-date laboratory reference ranges.
1. QUALITY CONTROL AND MAINTENANCE:
• Perform regular maintenance on the analyzer as per the
manufacturer's recommendations.
• Schedule and document any required calibration checks and
preventive maintenance.
• Run internal and external quality control samples regularly to
ensure analytical accuracy.
1. LIMITATIONS:
• Ensure specimens are free of contaminants that can interfere with
creatinine measurements.
• Specimens with abnormal turbidity or visible particulates should
be clarified or centrifuged before testing to minimize interference.
• Refer to the reagent and analyzer manuals for specific assay
limitations and potential interferences.

• Manufacturer’s Instructions and User Manual for the chemistry
analyzer used.
• Quality control and calibration documentation.
