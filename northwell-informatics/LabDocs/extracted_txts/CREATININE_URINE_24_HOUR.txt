Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for CREATININE, URINE, 24 HOUR
1. PURPOSE
To outline the standard procedures for the analysis of Creatinine in
24-hour urine samples to ensure reliable and accurate results. The
procedure covers sample handling, processing, testing, quality
control, and reporting of results.
1. DEFINITIONS
Creatinine: A waste product formed by the normal breakdown of
muscle cells and excreted by the kidneys. Measurement of creatinine
in urine helps assess kidney function.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the laboratory staff to follow this SOP to
ensure accurate and consistent results. It is the responsibility of the
supervisor to verify that the procedures are followed correctly and
that any corrective actions are taken when necessary.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Requirements and Handling
1. Collect a 24-hour urine specimen in a clean, properly labeled container.
2. Ensure the total urine volume is recorded on the container or accompanying documentation.
3. Keep the specimen refrigerated during the collection period. If refrigeration is not available, keep the container in a cool place and add preservatives if required.
4. Transfer the collected specimen to the laboratory promptly. If delayed, keep refrigerated or store at 2-8 °C.
B. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies
1. Equipment:
- Centrifuge
- Calibrated pipettes and pipette tips
- Urine analyzers or spectrophotometers
2. Reagents:
- Creatinine reagent set (traceable to standard references)
3. Supplies:
- Calibrated volumetric flasks
- Urine collection containers
- Labels and log sheets
C. Analytical Procedure
1. Preparation
a. Mix the 24-hour urine sample thoroughly.
b. Aliquot an appropriate volume (e.g., 5-10 mL) of the urine sample into a test tube for analysis.
2. Calibration and Quality Control
a. Prepare calibration standards and quality controls according to the analyzer’s instructions.
b. Ensure the analyzer is calibrated with the standards and reagent blanks.
c. Run quality control samples parallel to patient samples to monitor analytical performance. They should be within the established control limits.
3. Creatinine Analysis
a. Set up the analyzer or spectrophotometer for creatinine measurement.
b. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for the specific test system in use (e.g., kinetic Jaffe method).
c. Place the urine sample and appropriate reagents into the designated wells or cuvettes.
d. Initiate the test run according to instrument protocol.
4. Calculation
a. Record the creatinine concentration obtained from the analyzer.
b. Multiply the creatinine concentration by the total volume of the 24-hour urine collection to obtain 24-hour creatinine excretion in mg/day or mmol/day.
D. Reporting Results 1. Enter the creatinine concentration and
the 24-hour excretion into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS). 2. Ensure results are reviewed and validated by the
technologists. 3. Report any critical values immediately to the
requesting physician.
E. Quality Control and Maintenance 1. Conduct routine
maintenance and performance checks on analyzers as per
manufacturer guidelines. 2. Document quality control and
maintenance activities according to laboratory procedures. 3.
Perform periodic proficiency testing to ensure analytical
accuracy and precision.
2. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the specific instrument and reagent package inserts for
method limitations, such as interferences from medications and
substances in the sample that may impact the accuracy of the
results.
