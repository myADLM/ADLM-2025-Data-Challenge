Protocol for the Analytical Phase of Generating Results for Urine
Creatinine, Random
1. Purpose
This SOP outlines the steps and quality control measures required for
analyzing creatinine levels in random urine samples in order to
ensure accurate and reliable results.
1. Responsibility
Laboratory staff working in the clinical chemistry department are
responsible for performing urine creatinine analysis and ensuring that
the protocol is followed correctly. It is also their responsibility to report
any anomalies in the results or instrumentation to the supervisor
immediately.
1. Definition
This protocol includes the analysis of creatinine concentration in
random urine samples to assess kidney function and diagnose
various kidney-related disorders.
1. Specimen Requirements and Stability
a. Specimen Type
◦ Random urine sample
b. Specimen Volume
◦ Minimum required volume: 10 mL
c. Stability
◦ Freshly collected urine specimens: should be refrigerated if
not analyzed within 2 hours of collection and can be stored
at 2-8°C for up to 24 hours.
◦ Urine specimens preserved with BD Vacutainer Urinalysis
Preservative Conical Urine Tubes are stable for up to 72
hours at 4-25°C.
2. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies
a. Equipment
◦ Automated chemistry analyzer (e.g., Roche Cobas c501,
Beckman Coulter AU series)
◦ Calibrated analytical balance
◦ Calibrated pipettes and tips
b. Reagents
◦ Creatinine reagent specific to the analyzer
◦ Quality control materials (2 levels: normal and abnormal)
◦ Deionized water for dilutions
c. Supplies
◦ Disposable sample cups, gloves, lab coats
◦ Clean and labeled urine containers
◦ Calibration material as recommended by the reagent
manufacturer
3. Procedure
a. Pre-analytical Phase
1. Ensure that the urine sample is appropriately labeled and
meets the criteria for analysis (volume, preservation, etc.).
2. Visually inspect the urine for any signs of contamination or
discoloration that may interfere with analysis. Report and
document any issues.
b. Analytical Phase
1. Calibrate the analyzer with the creatinine calibrators as
per the manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Ensure all reagents are within their expiration date and
properly stored.
3. Perform quality control checks:
▪ Use quality control materials at two levels (normal and
high) before running patient samples.
▪ Document and verify that QC results are within
acceptable ranges. If QC results are out of range,
troubleshoot and resolve any issues before
proceeding.
4. Load the patient urine sample into an appropriately
labeled sample cup.
5. Set up the analyzer with the creatinine test parameters
and initiate the run.
6. Follow the analyzer’s operating manual to process the
sample. This may include steps for automatic dilution or
rerun if the specimen concentration falls outside the
measurable range.
7. Record the creatinine concentration result displayed by
the analyzer.
c. Post-analytical Phase
1. Review the results for any analytical flags or error
messages.
2. Verify and validate the results. Consider repeating the
analysis if results are inconsistent or flagged by the
system.
3. Record the validated results into the Laboratory
Information System (LIS) and report accordingly.
4. If any critical values or abnormal results are identified,
notify the designated physician or healthcare provider as
per laboratory policies.
5. Properly dispose of waste materials and decontaminate
work area according to laboratory safety guidelines.
4. Quality Control
a. Internal Quality Control
◦ Perform QC daily and whenever a new lot of reagent or
calibrator is opened.
◦ Document QC results, and if QC fails, take corrective
actions before analyzing any patient samples.
b. External Quality Control
◦ Participate in proficiency testing programs as mandated by
regulatory agencies to ensure accuracy and comparability.
5. Reporting Results
Report results as creatinine concentration in mg/dL or µmol/L based
on the laboratory’s reporting format. Include interpretation ranges if
necessary: - Normal range: 20-320 mg/dL (varies based on
population and specific method used)
