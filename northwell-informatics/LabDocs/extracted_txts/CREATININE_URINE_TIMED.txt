SOP: Analytical Phase of Generating Results for Creatinine, Urine,
Timed
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the analytical phase of
generating creatinine results from timed urine specimens using a
CLIA-approved method.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for
performing the analysis as described in this procedure. It is the
responsibility of the staff to ensure that every step of the procedure is
accurately followed and all documentation is completed in
accordance with laboratory guidelines.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/acceptable:
• Timed urine collection (24-hour urine specimen) submitted in a
clean, leak-proof container.
• Preserve the sample with 25 mL of 50% acetic acid if required. No
preservative is required if the sample is processed within 24
hours.
Unacceptable:
• Specimens with signs of contamination or improper preservation.
• Specimens with incomplete collection times or volumes not
recorded.
• Specimens not properly mixed before aliquoting.
Specimen Stability:
• Timed urine specimens can be stored at 2-8°C for up to 48 hours
before analysis.
• For longer storage, specimens can be frozen at -20°C for up to
one month.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Automated chemistry analyzer compatible with creatinine urine
assays (e.g., cobas c501/c311 analyzer)
• Calibrators and quality control materials with known creatinine
concentrations
• Pipettes and tips
• Timed urine collection containers
• Acetic acid preservative (if required)
1. PROCEDURE
A) Sample Preparation
1. Verify that the urine collection time and total volume are
recorded on the container.
2. Mix the timed urine collection thoroughly before aliquoting.
3. Aliquot a portion of the well-mixed urine sample into a
laboratory tube for analysis. Record the specimen identification
information.
B) Calibration and Quality Control
1. Perform calibration of the chemistry analyzer using calibrators
following the manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Run two levels of quality control material (normal and
abnormal) before batch testing of patient samples. Ensure QC
results are within the acceptable range.
C) Analytical Measurement
1. Load the urine aliquot into the chemistry analyzer.
2. Select the creatinine urine assay program on the analyzer.
3. Ensure a sufficient volume of sample is available for triplicate
analysis, if necessary, to ensure accuracy.
4. Start the analytical run, ensuring the analyzer measures
creatinine concentration accurately.
D) Recording and Reviewing Results
1. Once the analysis is complete, review the creatinine
concentration results on the analyzer.
2. Record the creatinine concentration into the laboratory
information system (LIS).
3. Evaluate the QC results to confirm that the assay run is within
quality control limits.
4. Validate and verify results in the LIS according to laboratory
protocols.
5. Calculate the total creatinine excretion per collection period
(e.g., mg/24h).
Formula: Total Creatinine (mg/24h) = (Creatinine concentration (mg/
L)) x (Total urine volume (L))
E) Reporting Results
1. A laboratory report will be generated from the LIS and reviewed
by the responsible technologist.
2. Ensure all patient information, sample details, and results are
accurately reported.
3. Forward validated results to the appropriate healthcare
provider.
4. QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSESSMENT
• Evaluate quality control (QC) data for each analytical run.
• Investigate and resolve any QC failures before analyzing patient
specimens.
• Recalibrate the analyzer and rerun QC if necessary.
• Conduct monthly and bi-weekly QC assessments according to
laboratory standards.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to the manufacturer’s insert for any limitations of the
creatinine, urine, timed assay.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s insert for the specific chemistry analyzer and
creatinine assay.
• Laboratory Quality Assurance guidelines.
1. DOCUMENTATION
• Maintain records of sample preparation, calibration, QC results,
analytical runs, and final reports.
• Document any corrective actions taken during the QC or
analytical phases.
This Standard Operating Procedure ensures consistent, reliable
generation of creatinine, urine, timed results, and sustains the
laboratory's adherence to quality management systems.
