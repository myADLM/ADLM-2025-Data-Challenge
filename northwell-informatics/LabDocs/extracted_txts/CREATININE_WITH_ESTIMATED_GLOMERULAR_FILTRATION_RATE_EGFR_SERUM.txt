Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical
Phase of Generating Results for Creatinine with
Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR), Serum
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedure for the accurate
and efficient analysis and reporting of serum creatinine levels along
with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). This ensures
consistent and reliable patient results in accordance with clinical
laboratory standards.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel performing serum
creatinine and eGFR analysis.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory personnel, including medical laboratory
scientists and technicians, are responsible for carrying out the
procedures detailed in this SOP. The laboratory supervisor is
responsible for ensuring compliance with this SOP.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Automated chemistry analyzer (e.g., Roche Cobas c 501,
Siemens Dimension EXL)
• Calibrators and controls specific for creatinine
• Serum samples
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Reagent kits for creatinine
• Quality control (QC) materials
5. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform QC checks using low, medium, and high controls at the
beginning of each shift and after every calibration.
• Document all QC results and take corrective actions if results fall
outside the acceptable range.
6. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred specimen: Serum collected in an SST (serum separator
tube)
• Stability: Store specimens at 2-8°C if analysis is not performed
immediately. Specimens are stable for up to 48 hours under these
conditions.
7. PROCEDURE
A) Calibration and Verification
1. Calibrate the chemistry analyzer according to manufacturer
instructions using the appropriate calibrators.
2. Run a set of quality control (QC) samples to verify calibration.
Ensure all QC results are within the acceptable range before
proceeding with patient samples.
B) Sample Preparation and Analysis
1. Ensure all serum specimens are properly labeled and have
been documented in the laboratory information system (LIS).
2. Mix the serum specimen gently by inverting the tube several
times.
3. Inspect the specimen for any hemolysis or clots. Reject and
request a new specimen if they are present.
4. Load the specimens onto the chemistry analyzer according to
the manufacturer's instructions.
5. Select the "Creatinine" test on the analyzer's software interface.
6. Initiate the analysis process.
C) Calculation of eGFR
1. Once the creatinine levels are obtained from the analyzer, the
laboratory information system (LIS) or the analyzer’s software
will automatically calculate the eGFR using the appropriate
equation (e.g., MDRD, CKD-EPI).
2. Ensure that patient demographics such as age, sex, and race
are correctly entered as these variables are required for an
accurate eGFR calculation.
8. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
• Reference Intervals:
◦ Serum Creatinine: 0.6 - 1.2 mg/dL (adult males), 0.5 - 1.1 mg/
dL (adult females)
◦ eGFR:
▪ Above 60 mL/min/1.73m^2 is generally considered normal
▪ Below 60 mL/min/1.73m^2 may indicate impaired renal
function
9. REPORTING RESULTS
• Review the generated results in the LIS.
• Verify results ensuring they are within the expected analytical
performance specifications.
• Report results with eGFR values to the ordering physician. Any
critical values should be immediately communicated to the
physician as per laboratory protocol.
10. CRITICAL RESULTS
• Serum Creatinine ≥ 4.0 mg/dL should be reported as a critical
value.
• eGFR < 15 mL/min/1.73m^2 should be reported as a critical
value.
• Document all communication regarding critical values.
11. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If QC results fail, re-calibrate the analyzer, rerun QC, and
document any corrective actions taken.
• Unacceptable specimen (e.g., hemolyzed, clotted): Notify the
clinician and request a new sample.
• Instrument errors: Follow manufacturer troubleshooting guide and
documentation procedures.
12. DOCUMENTATION
• Record all QC and calibration activities in the appropriate logs.
• Document any anomalies and corrective actions taken.
• Ensure all patient results and communications are accurately
logged in the LIS.
13. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's instructions for the chemistry analyzer and
creatinine reagent kits.
• Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines.
• National Kidney Foundation guidelines for eGFR calculation.
14. REVIEW/APPROVAL
This SOP must be reviewed annually by the laboratory supervisor
and updated as needed to comply with current laboratory best
practices and regulatory requirements.
This protocol ensures consistency, accuracy, and compliance with
regulatory standards for the measurement and reporting of serum
creatinine and eGFR in patient samples.
