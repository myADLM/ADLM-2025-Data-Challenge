Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease Evaluation
Interpretation, Spinal Fluid
1. PURPOSE
To establish a standardized method for interpreting spinal fluid
specimens for Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD) evaluation, ensuring
accuracy of results and a timely response for diagnostic aid.
Responsibility:
• All laboratory technologists and designated personnel involved in
the evaluation, handling, and interpreting of CJD spinal fluid
specimens.
• Laboratory supervisors are responsible for ensuring adherence to
this SOP and addressing any deviations or issues that may
impact the interpretation of results.
1. SPECIMEN
Accepted Specimen:
• 5-10 mL of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) collected in a sterile, screw-
capped container, delivered to the laboratory under appropriate
biohazard precautions.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• CSF specimens that are leaking, visibly turbid, or hemolyzed.
• Specimens not labeled with patient identification or collection date
and time.
• Specimens that are received more than 48 hours after collection if
not appropriately refrigerated or 72 hours if not frozen at -80°C or
colder.
• Specimens containing preservatives other than those
recommended.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Refrigerated centrifuge
• Standard laboratory supplies (pipettes, tips, gloves, etc.)
• Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits or specific
assays for CJD markers (e.g., 14-3-3 protein, tau protein assays)
• Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) equipment and reagents (if
performing genetic analysis)
• Control reagents (positive and negative controls)
• Biosafety cabinet
• Refrigerator set at 2-8°C for reagent storage
• Freezer set at -80°C for specimen storage
1. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Processing:
1. Perform a preliminary macroscopic check for the integrity and
quality of the CSF sample.
2. Assign a unique laboratory accession number to each patient
sample.
3. Store samples at 2-8°C if tested within 48 hours. If testing is
delayed, freeze samples at -80°C.
B. Analytical Process:
ELISA Method for 14-3-3 Protein Detection:
1. Thaw CSF samples and control reagents stored at -80°C to
2-8°C prior to analysis.
2. Vortex samples gently and centrifuge at 1000 x g for 10 minutes
at 4°C to remove cellular debris.
3. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for the 14-3-3 ELISA
assay:
◦ Add the required volume of sample/control to the microplate
wells.
◦ Incubate as specified, then wash the wells according to the
kit protocol.
◦ Add detection antibodies and other reagents in the
prescribed order.
◦ Measure absorbance using a microplate reader.
Tau Protein Assay:
1. Perform similar steps for tau protein detection using the specific
tau ELISA kit.
2. Follow the specific incubation, washing, and detection steps as
per the kit instructions.
PCR for PrP Gene Mutations (if required):
1. Extract DNA from 200 μL CSF using a validated DNA extraction
kit.
2. Set up the PCR reaction mix according to the primer and
reagent manufacturer’s recommendations.
3. Analyze amplicons by gel electrophoresis or an appropriate
post-PCR detection method.
C. Quality Control:
1. Include both positive and negative controls in each run.
2. Controls must fall within the specified range to validate the run.
3. Repeat runs if control values fall outside the acceptable range,
investigate causes, and report deviations.
D. Interpretation and Reporting:
1. Compare patient CSF absorbance or PCR results with control
values.
2. Re-evaluate any borderline or ambiguous results by re-testing
or using alternative assays.
3. Document and verify all results in the LIS (Laboratory
Information System).
4. Report findings with comprehensive interpretation remarks in
accordance with site-specific reporting guidelines. Ensure a
clear clinical interpretation is provided (e.g., positive, negative,
or indeterminate for CJD markers).
5. REFERENCE INTERVALS AND CRITICAL RESULTS
14-3-3 Protein:
• Negative: Absorbance below the negative control threshold.
• Positive: Absorbance above positive control threshold.
• Borderline/Indeterminate: Absorbance between control
thresholds.
Tau Protein:
• Refer to the tau protein assay insert for reference ranges.
PCR Results:
• Negative: No amplification of target genetic markers or mutations.
• Positive: Amplification observed at expected size.
Reporting Critical Results:
• Positive results indicative of Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease must be
promptly reported to the requesting physician and documented.
• Any critical findings resulting from unexpected or erroneous
results require a review and notification per established laboratory
guidelines.

• Manufacturer’s instructions for ELISA kits and PCR reagents.
• Relevant literature and guidelines on CJD diagnosis from
authoritative bodies such as the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention.
By following this SOP, the laboratory ensures the consistent,
accurate, and reliable interpretation of CSF samples for Creutzfeldt-
Jakob Disease evaluation.
