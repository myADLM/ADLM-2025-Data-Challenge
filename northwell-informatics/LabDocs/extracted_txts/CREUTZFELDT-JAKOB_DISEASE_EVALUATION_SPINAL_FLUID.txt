STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP): ANALYTICAL
PHASE OF GENERATING RESULTS FOR CREUTZFELDT-JAKOB
DISEASE EVALUATION, SPINAL FLUID
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to delineate the procedure for the
analytical phase of processing and generating results for Creutzfeldt-
Jakob Disease (CJD) evaluation using spinal fluid (CSF) specimens.
This ensures accurate and reliable results for the diagnosis of CJD.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
All designated laboratory personnel trained in handling and
processing CSF specimens are responsible for adhering to the
procedures outlined in this SOP. Supervisors are responsible for
ensuring compliance and addressing any issues that arise during the
process.
1. DEFINITIONS
Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD): A rare, degenerative, fatal brain
disorder significantly impacting brain function.
Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF): A clear fluid found in the brain and spinal
cord that is analyzed to diagnose various neurological conditions,
including CJD.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Type: Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF)
• Volume: A minimum of 1-2 mL of CSF.
• Collection and Transport: Collected aseptically in sterile
containers and kept refrigerated (2-8°C) if not analyzed
immediately. Transport to the laboratory must occur within 24
hours of collection. Do not freeze the sample.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• PPE: Gloves, lab coat, face shield/mask
• Centrifuge
• Pipette and pipette tips
• CSF Testing Kits specific for CJD-related markers (e.g., 14-3-3
protein, tau protein, RT-QuIC assay)
• ELISA/Western blot apparatus (if applicable)
• Refrigerated storage (2-8°C)
• Laboratory computer system for data input
1. PROCEDURE
6.1 Preliminary Steps
1. Verify specimen integrity upon receipt: check labeling and
ensure no contamination or hemolysis.
2. Log the specimen into the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
and assign a unique specimen identifier.
6.2 Centrifugation
1. Transfer the CSF into sterile centrifuge tubes, making sure to
balance the tubes properly.
2. Centrifuge the CSF at 500 x g for 10 minutes at 4°C to remove
cellular debris.
3. Carefully transfer the supernatant to labeled, clean tubes,
ensuring no cellular contamination.
6.3 Analytical Testing
a) 14-3-3 Protein Testing (Qualitative/Western Blot)
1. Follow the specific kit instructions to prepare and run the assay.
2. Load the prepared samples onto the appropriate gels/
membranes.
3. Process according to the kit protocol (electrophoresis, transfer,
antibody incubation).
4. Visualize and document the results.
b) Tau Protein Testing (ELISA)
1. Prepare the ELISA plate and reagents as per the
manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Pipette CSF and standards into designated wells.
3. Follow the protocol for incubation, washing, and detection
steps.
4. Read the plate using an ELISA reader at the recommended
wavelength.
5. Document the concentration of the tau protein in the LIS.
c) RT-QuIC Assay (Real-Time Quaking-Induced Conversion)
1. Prepare reagents according to the RT-QuIC kit’s instructions.
2. Add the required amount of CSF to reaction wells.
3. Perform the assay in a real-time PCR machine set to the
recommended cycling parameters.
4. Analyze and interpret the amplification curves against controls
for CJD screening.
6.4 Quality Control
1. Include positive and negative controls for each assay batch.
2. Ensure that all control results fall within the acceptable ranges
before validating patient results.
3. Document all QC findings and take corrective actions if
necessary.
4. RESULT VALIDATION
5. Review all results for consistency and accuracy.
6. Confirm that all control results are acceptable.
7. Verify the results in the LIS and compile a comprehensive
report for clinician review.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
9. Results are entered into the LIS and reviewed by a senior
technologist.
10. The finalized report is verified and signed off by the supervising
pathologist.
11. Results are communicated to the requesting physician through
secure, designated channels.
12. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to the specific reagent kit inserts for detailed method
limitations.
• Ensure awareness of potential cross-reactivity or interference that
could impact test results.
