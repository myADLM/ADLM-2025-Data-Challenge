Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Cryoglobulin
and Cryofibrinogen Panel, Serum and Plasma Testing
1. PURPOSE:
To provide a structured and standardized approach for the detection
and quantification of cryoglobulins and cryofibrinogen in serum and
plasma samples.
2. SCOPE:
This procedure applies to all clinical laboratory staff involved in the
processing and testing of blood specimens for cryoglobulin and
cryofibrinogen panels.
3. RESPONSIBILITY:
• All designated laboratory personnel who perform cryoglobulin and
cryofibrinogen testing.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring compliance with this
SOP.
4. DEFINITIONS:
• Cryoglobulins: Immunoglobulins that precipitate or gel at
temperatures below normal body temperature (37°C) and dissolve
upon rewarming.
• Cryofibrinogen: Fibrinogen-containing complexes that precipitate
at cold temperatures and dissolve upon rewarming.
5. SPECIMEN:
• Preferred/Acceptable Specimen for Cryoglobulin:
◦ 10-12 mL of blood collected in a pre-warmed red-top (no
additive) tube.
◦ Blood must be collected and maintained at 37°C from
collection to processing to avoid premature precipitation.
◦ Serum must be separated from clot within 1 hour of collection
and kept at 37°C until clot is fully retracted.
• Preferred/Acceptable Specimen for Cryofibrinogen:
◦ 10-12 mL of blood collected in a pre-warmed blue-top tube
containing sodium citrate.
◦ Blood must be collected and maintained at 37°C and plasma
separated within 1 hour of collection.
6. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES:
• Water bath/incubator set to 37°C.
• Centrifuge capable of maintaining 37°C.
• Pre-warmed collection tubes (red-top for serum, blue-top for
plasma).
• Cryoglobulin and cryofibrinogen reagent kits.
• Timer.
• Pipettes and pipette tips.
• Labeling materials and system compatible with LIS.
• Cryoprecipitate tubes or glass containers.
7. PROCEDURE:
A. Pre-Analytical Phase:
1. Specimen Collection and Maintenance:
◦ Blood samples must be collected in pre-warmed tubes and
maintained at 37°C through all steps.
◦ Clearly instruct and ensure phlebotomists and nursing staff
understand blood needs to remain at 37°C.
◦ Transport specimens in a warmed container immediately to
the laboratory.
2. Serum/Plasma Separation:
◦ Centrifuge samples at 37°C at 1800 to 2500 g for 10
minutes.
◦ Decant serum or plasma into a pre-warmed cryoprecipitate
tube.
◦ Serum and plasma aliquots should be stored at 2-8°C until
analysis, ensuring samples never cool below 37°C during
processing.
B. Analytical Phase:
1. Cryoglobulin Testing:
◦ Incubate 1-2 mL of serum at 4°C for 1-7 days to observe for
cryoglobulin formation.
◦ Inspect daily for precipitation.
◦ Clarify any precipitate in a warm water bath (37°C). If
precipitate dissolves, it is confirmed as cryoglobulin.
◦ Document presence or absence, and level of precipitation.
Quantitate if applicable.
2. Cryofibrinogen Testing:
◦ Incubate 1-2 mL of plasma at 4°C for 24-48 hours.
◦ Utilize parallel aliquot as control stored at 37°C.
◦ Inspect for formation of visible precipitate in samples
incubated at 4°C, ensuring control sample remains clear.
◦ Confirm the nature of precipitate by redissolving at 37°C.
◦ Document presence and quantity of cryofibrinogen.
8. QUALITY CONTROL:
• Perform quality control with known positive and negative
cryoglobulin and cryofibrinogen controls with each run.
• Document results of quality control to ensure accuracy.
• Address any deviations or failures according to laboratory
standard guidelines.
9. REPORTING RESULTS:
• Enter results in LIS and verify by a technologist before approval.
• For positive cryoglobulin and cryofibrinogen detection: Report
type, quantitation level, fixation temperature, and time observed
for precipitation.
• Flag any critical results and follow established protocol for
notifying the physician.
10. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
• Ensure accurate temperature maintenance to avoid false
negatives or positives.
• Precipitation may be influenced by sample handling; meticulous
protocol adherence is crucial.
11. REFERENCES:
• Document all references and guidelines followed for the
cryoglobulin and cryofibrinogen testing, including manufacturer
instructions and clinical laboratory standards.
• Example references: Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute
(CLSI) Guidelines.
Ensure all laboratory personnel are trained on the specifics of this
SOP and demonstrate competencies in its application. Regular audits
are performed to maintain adherence and proper functionality of the
procedure.
