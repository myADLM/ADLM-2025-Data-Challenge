Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for CRYOGLOBULIN, SERUM
Analysis
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the analytical procedure for the
detection and quantification of cryoglobulins in serum specimens.
Cryoglobulins are immunoglobulins that precipitate at cooler
temperatures and dissolve upon rewarming, and their detection is
critical for diagnosing cryoglobulinemia, a condition often associated
with various infections, autoimmune diseases, and
lymphoproliferative disorders.
Responsibility: It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory
personnel to perform the analysis of cryoglobulins, document it
accurately, and validate the results. Supervisors are responsible for
ensuring proper adherence to the procedure and addressing
deficiencies or discrepancies encountered during the analysis.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen Type: Serum
Specimen Collection: - Collect blood specimen in a red-top tube
without anticoagulants. - Maintain specimen at 37°C during
collection, transport, and processing to prevent cryoglobulin
precipitation. - Allow the blood to clot at 37°C for a minimum of 1
hour. - Centrifuge the blood sample at 37°C to separate serum from
red cells. - Transfer serum into pre-warmed tubes and keep at 37°C
until analysis.
Specimen Stability: - Cryoglobulins are temperature-sensitive; serum
samples must be maintained at 37°C from collection through the
initial processing phase. - Store serum specimens at room
temperature if analysis is not performed immediately.
Unacceptable Specimens: - Specimens not maintained at 37°C
during collection and processing. - Specimens collected with
anticoagulants. - Specimens contaminated with red blood cells or
visible hemolysis. - Specimens stored or transported inappropriately.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment: - Pre-warmed centrifuge - Water bath or heating blocks
capable of maintaining 37°C - Refrigerator set at 4°C for cryoglobulin
precipitation - Microscope
Reagents: - Normal saline (0.9% NaCl) - Anti-human immunoglobulin
reagents (for immunotyping, if applicable)
Supplies: - Red-top tubes - Pre-warmed glass tubes - Tube racks
1. PROCEDURE
A) Specimen Preparation: - Ensure serum specimen is maintained at
37°C during clotting and centrifugation. - Centrifuge the blood at 37°C
for 10-15 minutes at proper speed to obtain clear serum. - Transfer
the serum into pre-warmed glass tubes and keep at 37°C until
precipitation step.
B) Cryoglobulin Precipitation: - Refrigerate the serum samples at 4°C
for 24-48 hours. - Examine the serum tubes daily for the presence of
cryoglobulin precipitate.
C) Detection and Quantification: - Inspect the precipitate visually. -
Quantify cryoglobulin by measuring the height of the precipitate layer
relative to the total serum volume. Report the percentage of
cryoglobulins. - Rewarm the sample at 37°C to confirm cryoglobulin
dissolution.
D) Immunotyping: - If required for clinical diagnosis, perform
immunotyping for cryoglobulins using anti-human immunoglobulin
reagents (Anti-IgG, Anti-IgM, Anti-IgA). - Mix serum with specific anti-
human immunoglobulin reagents and observe under the microscope
for agglutinations indicating specific cryoglobulin types.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Perform quality control checks with known cryoglobulin-
positive and cryoglobulin-negative serum samples.
◦ Verify proper temperature maintenance during specimen
processing and analysis.
◦ Ensure that all equipment used for temperature-sensitive
processes (centrifuge, water bath, heating block) is
calibrated and functioning correctly.
◦ Document all steps performed, observations, and results in
appropriate log sheets.
2. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ Enter results into the laboratory information system (LIS)
including cryoglobulin percentage and immunotype (if
applicable).
◦ Report critical findings immediately to the ordering
physician.
◦ Ensure results are reviewed and verified by the technologist
and the supervisor, especially if there are critical or
unexpected values.

4. METHOD LIMITATIONS
◦ Cryoglobulin testing is highly temperature-sensitive;
improper sample handling might lead to false negatives.
◦ Hemolyzed samples might affect visual inspection and
quantification accuracy.
◦ Patients with certain conditions like hyperlipidemia may
show interference in visual precipitate observations.
This SOP must be followed diligently to ensure the accuracy and
reliability of cryoglobulin testing, which supports the clinical diagnosis
and management of patients with cryoglobulinemia.
