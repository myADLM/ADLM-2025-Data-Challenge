CRYPTOCOCCAL ANTIGEN (CRAg), CEREBROSPINAL FLUID
(CSF) OR SERUM
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to detail the steps necessary to
accurately analyze and generate results for Cryptococcal Antigen
(CRAg) from CSF or serum specimens using latex agglutination tests
or enzyme immunoassay methods.
Responsibility:
Laboratory personnel are responsible for performing CRAg testing
according to the procedures outlined below, documenting results, and
communicating any anomalies to the supervisor.
1. SPECIMEN
Preferred/Acceptable:
• Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF): Collect by lumbar puncture in a sterile,
leakproof container.
• Serum: Collect in a sterile red-top tube or serum separator tube
(SST).
Unacceptable:
• Specimens that are visibly contaminated.
• CSF specimens with significant blood contamination.
• Serum specimens with hemolysis.
• Specimens lacking proper identification, collection date, or time.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Cryptococcal Antigen latex agglutination test kit or enzyme
immunoassay kit
• Pipettes and tips
• Test tubes or microwell plates
• Timer
• Vortex mixer
• Incubator or heat block (if specified by kit manufacturer)
• Positive and negative controls
• Logbook for recording procedural details and results
1. PROCEDURE
Latex Agglutination Method:
1. Specimen Preparation:
◦ CSF: Ensure specimen is clear and free of blood.
◦ Serum: Centrifuge and separate serum from clot.
2. Implement Kit-Specific Procedure:
◦ Refer to the latex agglutination kit insert for detailed
instructions.
◦ Generally involves mixing specimen with latex reagent on a
card or microwell and observing for agglutination.
3. Controls:
◦ Include positive and negative controls with each batch of
tests.
◦ Document control results in the logbook.
4. Result Interpretation:
◦ Observe for agglutination following the kit manufacturer's
guidelines.
◦ Record agglutination results (positive/negative) alongside
specimen information.
Enzyme Immunoassay Method:
1. Specimen Preparation:
◦ CSF: Ensure specimen is clear and free of blood.
◦ Serum: Centrifuge and separate serum from clot.
2. Implement Kit-Specific Procedure:
◦ Refer to the enzyme immunoassay kit insert for detailed
instructions.
◦ Generally involves adding specimen to microwells coated
with antigen, adding detection antibody, and reading the
reaction at specified wavelength.
3. Controls:
◦ Include quality controls as indicated in the kit insert.
◦ Document control results in the logbook.
4. Result Interpretation:
◦ Measure optical density using a plate reader.
◦ Compare optical density to the calibration curve to
determine antigen concentration.
◦ Record results along with specimen information.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
Material:
• Positive and negative controls included in the test kits.
• Ensure all control results are within acceptable ranges before
validating patient results.
Procedure:
• Perform QC with each batch of tests: Document control results in
the logbook.
• If controls do not meet specified criteria, review procedures,
reagents, and equipment. Repeat controls as needed before
proceeding.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
Result Documentation:
• Record results, including patient identification, specimen type,
and date/time of analysis.
• Positive results should include antigen concentration if using
enzyme immunoassay.
Critical Result Notification:
• Notify the attending physician or designated contact immediately
upon obtaining a positive CRAg result from CSF.
Reference Intervals:
• Negative: No agglutination or optical density below the cut-off
value.
• Positive: Agglutination observed or optical density above the cut-
off value.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Review kit-specific limitations detailed in manufacturer's insert.
• Interference from hemolysis or blood contamination can affect
results.
