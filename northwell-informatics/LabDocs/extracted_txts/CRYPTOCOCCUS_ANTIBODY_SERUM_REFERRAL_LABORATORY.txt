STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP) Title: Analytical
Phase Protocol for Generating Results for Cryptococcus Antibody,
Serum Referral Laboratory
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for the analytical phase of generating results
for Cryptococcus Antibody in serum samples referred to an external,
specialized laboratory. This SOP ensures consistency, accuracy, and
timeliness in the processing of these samples and includes
procedures for handling, analyzing, reporting, and documenting
results.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for following this
protocol to ensure correct handling, analysis, and reporting of
Cryptococcus Antibody results. It is the responsibility of all staff
members to identify and report any discrepancies or issues
encountered during the analytical phase to the supervisor.
1. DEFINITION
Cryptococcus Antibody: A serological test to detect antibodies against
the fungal pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans.
Referral Laboratory: An external, specialized laboratory equipped to
perform advanced Cryptococcus antibody testing using methods like
enzyme immunoassay (EIA) or lateral flow assay (LFA).
1. PROCEDURE
A) Sample Preparation and Verification:
1. Verify that the serum sample meets the acceptance criteria
stipulated in the specimen collection SOP, including proper
labeling (patient ID, date and time of collection).
2. Ensure that sample volume is at least 2 mL of serum.
3. Record all specimen details in the laboratory information
system (LIS), including time of receipt, volume, and any
relevant patient information.
4. Centrifuge serum samples if needed to ensure clarity before
sending to the referral lab.
B) Packaging and Transport:
1. Place each serum sample in a leak-proof, properly labeled vial.
2. Package samples according to referral laboratory guidelines,
ensuring they are maintained at required temperature
conditions during transport (typically 2-8°C).
3. Prepare necessary documentation, including test requisition
form and referral laboratory contact information.
4. Use a reliable courier service for transport, ensuring tracking
and confirmation of specimen delivery.
C) Referral Laboratory Processing:
1. Referral laboratory will follow its internal SOPs for
Cryptococcus Antibody testing, using validated methods as
specified in their procedural documentation.
D) Results Reporting:
1. Referral laboratory will send the results back to the originating
laboratory electronically or via secure fax.
2. Upon receiving test results, the desginated laboratory
personnel will formally log the results into the LIS, reviewing
them for any quality control flags or comments from the referral
laboratory.
3. Communicate results to the ordering physician promptly,
following site-specific reporting guidelines for infectious disease
results.
E) Quality Control and Documentation:
1. Record all specimen handling, packing, and transportation
details in the designated logbook.
2. Ensure all procedural steps and deviations during sample
handling and transport are documented.
3. Review test results from the referral laboratory for consistency
with expected values and quality control measures.
4. Maintain records of communications with the referral laboratory,
including any troubleshooting or clarifications.
5. Archive test results and related documentation for future
reference, complying with laboratory and regulatory standards.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
7. Confirm the results logged in the LIS match those provided by
the referral laboratory.
8. Utilize standard reporting formats and include any interpretive
comments provided by referral lab.
9. Follow site-specific protocols for critical results, ensuring timely
notification and proper documentation of these notifications.
10. REFERENCE RANGES
Reference ranges for Cryptococcus Antibody results should be
provided by the referral laboratory and will be documented in the LIS
for interpretive purposes.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the referral laboratory's documentation for limitations specific
to Cryptococcus Antibody testing methods.
