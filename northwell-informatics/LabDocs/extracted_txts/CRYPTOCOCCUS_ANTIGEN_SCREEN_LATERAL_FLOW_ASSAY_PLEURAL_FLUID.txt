Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Cryptococcus Antigen Screen, Lateral
Flow Assay, Pleural Fluid
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedures for the analysis of pleural fluid specimens
using the Cryptococcus Antigen Lateral Flow Assay (CrAg LFA) to
ensure consistent and accurate results.
Responsibility:
The analyst performing the test is responsible for adhering to this
procedure. It is also the responsibility of the laboratory supervisor to
ensure that all analysts are adequately trained and that the
procedures are followed correctly.
1. DEFINITION
Cryptococcus Antigen Lateral Flow Assay (CrAg LFA) is an
immunochromatographic test intended for the qualitative detection of
Cryptococcus neoformans and Cryptococcus gattii antigens in pleural
fluid specimens.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND HANDLING
• Preferred Specimen Type: Pleural fluid, fresh
• Volume: 2-5 mL
• Unacceptable Specimens:
◦ Specimens with visible bacterial contamination.
◦ Specimens that have been grossly hemolyzed.
◦ Specimens stored for more than 72 hours at 2-8°C or not
properly refrigerated.
Note: Ensure the specimen has been mixed properly prior to
analysis.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Items:
◦ Cryptococcus Antigen Lateral Flow Assay Test Kit
◦ Test devices
◦ Sample collection vials
◦ Timer
◦ Pipettes and tips
◦ Negative and positive control solutions
◦ Sample diluent
◦ Protective gloves and lab coat
Reagent Storage: Store CrAg LFA test kit at 2-30°C. Do not use
reagents past their expiry date.
1. PROCEDURE
1. Test Setup:
• Follow the manufacturer's instructions for preparation of the
lateral flow assay.
• Ensure that all reagents and specimens are at room temperature
before use.
• Label one test device per specimen to be tested. Write clearly to
avoid mixing up samples.
2. Sample Preparation:
• Vortex the pleural fluid specimen gently to ensure proper mixing
without causing frothing.
• Using a clean pipette tip, draw the required amount of pleural fluid
(e.g., 40 μL) and add into the labeled test device's sample port.
• Alternatively, specimens can be diluted per manufacturer
instructions before adding to the test device.
3. Run Test:
• Add the recommended amount of sample diluent to the test
device following the manufacturer's instructions.
• Start the timer according to the manufacturer's specified
incubation time (often around 10 minutes).
4. Reading Results:
• Read the test results at the specified time, typically 10 minutes
after sample application.
• Control line (C) must be present to ensure the test is valid.
• Positive result: Both control line (C) and test line (T) appear.
• Negative result: Only control line (C) appears.
• Invalid result: If the control line (C) does not appear, the test is
invalid and must be repeated.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run positive and negative controls with each new lot, shipment,
and whenever the integrity of the test results is in question.
• Record control results in the quality control logbook.
Acceptance Criteria:
• Positive control must show a positive result.
• Negative control must show a negative result.
• If controls do not provide expected results, do not proceed with
test results reporting until issue is resolved.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Document test results in the laboratory information system (LIS).
• Report results to the physician using the designated reporting
format.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Positive Result: Presence of Cryptococcus antigen detected
• Negative Result: Absence of Cryptococcus antigen detected
1. LIMITATIONS OF METHOD
• Refer to the product insert provided by the manufacturer for
specific test limitations.
• False negatives may occur when the antigen levels are below the
detection limit.
• Hemolyzed or contaminated samples may yield invalid results.
1. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS
• Follow standard precautions when handling patient specimens.
• Dispose of used test devices and reagents according to biohazard
waste disposal protocols.
