Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Cryptococcus Antigen
Screen, Lateral Flow Assay, Urine
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for performing a Cryptococcus Antigen
Screen using a lateral flow assay on random urine specimens to
ensure accurate and reliable results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
All trained laboratory personnel are responsible for performing this
procedure accurately and adhering to the guidelines identified in this
SOP. Supervisors are responsible for ensuring compliance through
routine monitoring and verification.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Accepted Specimen:
• Random urine specimen, collected in a sterile container.
• Specimen should be tested within 24 hours of collection. If testing
will be delayed, the specimen must be refrigerated at 2-8°C and
tested within 48 hours.
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Specimens collected in non-sterile containers.
• Urine specimens with visible contamination or excessive turbidity.
• Specimens that have not been stored properly.
4. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Cryptococcus Antigen lateral flow assay kit
• Sterile specimen containers
• Micropipette and tips
• Timer
• Personal protective equipment (PPE) (gloves, lab coat, face
shield)
• Biohazard disposal containers
• Refrigerator (for specimen storage if required)
5. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation:
1. Wear appropriate PPE before handling specimens or reagents.
2. Gather all materials and reagents needed for the assay.
3. Briefly review the assay kit instructions provided by the
manufacturer to ensure familiarity with specific lot instructions
and expiration dates.
B. Sample Preparation:
1. Gently mix the urine specimen by inverting the container
several times.
2. Allow the specimen to reach room temperature if stored under
refrigeration.
C. Assay Procedure:
1. Label the test device with the patient's identification number or
assigned laboratory number.
2. Using a micropipette, draw 80 µL (as per manufacturer's
instructions) of urine specimen.
3. Add the urine specimen directly to the sample well of the lateral
flow assay device.
4. Start the timer immediately.
D. Incubation and Reaction:
1. Incubate the test device at room temperature and observe the
result window after the appropriate reaction time (usually 10–20
minutes, refer to manufacturer's instructions).
2. Do not read results before or after the recommended time
window to avoid inaccurate results.
E. Interpreting Results:
1. Positive Result: Two visible bands appear - one in the control
region (C) and one in the test region (T). Intensity of the T band
may vary.
2. Negative Result: Only one visible band appears in the control
region (C).
3. Invalid Result: No visible band in the control region (C),
regardless of the appearance of a band in the test region (T).
The test should be repeated with a new device.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Record all results immediately following interpretation.
2. All positive and invalid results should be confirmed by repeat
testing, and a supervisor should be promptly informed.
3. Record the results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
following site-specific reporting guidelines.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Perform quality control testing daily using positive and negative
controls provided in or recommended by the assay kit.
2. Document all control results. If control results fall outside
acceptable ranges, do not proceed with patient testing until the
issue is resolved, notify a supervisor immediately.
8. PROCEDURE LIMITATIONS
1. A negative test does not rule out Cryptococcus infection.
Clinical correlation with patient history and other diagnostic
information is necessary.
2. Cross-reactivity with other antigens or substances in urine may
yield false results. Follow the manufacturer’s guidelines for
known interferences.

10. SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS
1. Handle all urine specimens as biohazardous material.
2. Dispose of all used materials as per the biohazard disposal
protocol.
3. Clean work surfaces with appropriate disinfectants after assay
completion.
