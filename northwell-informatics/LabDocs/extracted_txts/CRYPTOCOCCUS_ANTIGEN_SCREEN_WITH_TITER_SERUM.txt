Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Cryptococcus Antigen
Screen with Titer, Serum
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to define the steps required to perform
the analytical phase of the Cryptococcus Antigen Screen with Titer in
serum specimens. This includes testing protocol, quality control, and
results reporting.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all clinical laboratory personnel trained to
perform the Cryptococcus Antigen Screen with Titer, Serum.
3. RESPONSIBILITIES
Laboratory personnel are responsible for:
• Performing the Cryptococcus Antigen Screen with Titer according
to this SOP.
• Ensuring quality control procedures are followed.
• Accurately reporting results.
• Informing the supervisor in the event of any deviations or
unexpected occurrences during testing.
4. SPECIMEN
Preferred/Acceptable Specimen:
• Serum collected in a serum separator tube (SST).
• Specimens should be centrifuged to separate the serum and
aliquoted if not tested immediately.
• Store specimens at 2-8°C if testing will be performed within 72
hours. For long-term storage, freeze specimens at -20°C or
colder.
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric specimens which may interfere with
the test results.
• Specimens not properly labeled or with incomplete requisition
forms.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• Test kit for Cryptococcus Antigen with Titer (e.g., latex
agglutination or enzyme immunoassay)
• Micropipettes and tips
• Test tubes or microplates
• Centrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Timer
• Quality Control materials (positive and negative controls)
6. PROCEDURE
1. Specimen Preparation:
◦ Allow refrigerated or frozen specimen to come to room
temperature before testing.
◦ Mix serum thoroughly by gentle inversion or using a vortex
mixer.
2. Test Setup:
◦ Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for setting up the
Cryptococcus Antigen Screen with Titer test kit. Make sure
to use control materials provided with the kit.
◦ Label test tubes or wells according to the testing sequence
(patient specimen, positive control, negative control).
3. Assay Procedure:
◦ Add the required volume of patient serum and controls to
the respective tubes or wells.
◦ Add the reagent (antigen) provided in the kit to all tubes or
wells.
◦ Mix thoroughly and incubate for the time specified by the
manufacturer (e.g., 30 minutes to 1 hour).
◦ Observe for agglutination or follow ELISA protocols if using
enzyme immunoassay.
4. Titer Determination:
◦ If initial screen is positive, perform serial dilutions of the
serum sample using PBS or dilution buffer provided.
◦ Repeat the assay steps using the diluted samples.
◦ The highest dilution that shows a positive result
(agglutination or ELISA signal) is recorded as the titer.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include positive and negative controls in each assay run.
• Ensure controls fall within the manufacturer's specified ranges. If
controls do not fall within acceptable limits, repeat the assay.
• Document all quality control results in the provided log.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results should be reported as either:
◦ Negative (no agglutination or signal below a defined
threshold).
◦ Positive (agglutination or signal above the threshold).
◦ If positive, report the highest positive dilution as the titer.
• Document any deviations or issues encountered during testing
and log the results in an appropriate database or Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
9. LIMITATIONS
• Cross-reactivity with other fungal antigens can occur. Results
should be interpreted with consideration of patient history and
other diagnostic information.
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric specimens can interfere with the
test and may lead to inaccurate results.
• Inadequate sample handling, such as incorrect storage or delayed
testing, may affect the reliability of results.
