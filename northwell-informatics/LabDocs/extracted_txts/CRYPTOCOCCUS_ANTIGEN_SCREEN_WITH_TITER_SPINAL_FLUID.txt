CRYPTOCOCCUS ANTIGEN SCREEN WITH TITER, SPINAL
FLUID - SOP
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the procedure to determine the presence of
Cryptococcus antigen in spinal fluid (CSF) and, if positive, perform a
titration to determine the antigen concentration.
Responsibility:
Laboratory personnel responsible for testing are required to adhere
strictly to this SOP, ensuring the accuracy and reliability of results.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen:
• Preferred/Acceptable: 1-2 mL of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
collected via lumbar puncture into a sterile, leak-proof container.
• Unacceptable: Specimens with visible contamination or those not
labeled with patient identification, collection date, and time.
Stability:
• Store CSF specimens at 2-8°C if analysis is delayed. All testing
should be performed within 24 hours of collection.
3. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
Equipment:
• Refrigerated centrifuge
• Timer
• Micropipettes and tips
• Test tubes and rack
• Vortex mixer
• Laminar flow hood
Reagents:
• Cryptococcus antigen latex agglutination test kit
• Positive and negative control sera
• Dilution buffer (phosphate-buffered saline or kit-specific buffer)
• Disposable latex agglutination slides
4. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run positive and negative control sera with each batch of tests to
ensure accuracy.
• Document the lot number and expiration date of reagents.
• QC must conform within specific ranges provided with the test kit
inserts. If QC deviates, review procedures, reagents, and
equipment.
• Maintain a log of control results.
5. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation:
1. Allow reagents, controls, and specimens to reach room
temperature (20-25°C) before starting the assay.
2. Label test tubes and reagent containers clearly.
B. Cryptococcus Antigen Screening:
1. Vortex the CSF sample gently.
2. If the sample is cloudy, perform a preliminary centrifugation step
(10 minutes at 3,000 RPM) and use the supernatant for testing.
3. Using a micropipette, add 50 µL of undiluted CSF to the
reaction well on the latex agglutination slide.
4. Add 50 µL of latex reagent to the same well and gently mix by
swirling the slide.
5. Start the timer and allow the mixture to react for 5 minutes at
room temperature.
6. Observe the slide under adequate lighting for agglutination
(visible clumping).
Interpretation:
• Negative Result: No agglutination within 5 minutes.
• Positive Result: Visible agglutination—proceed to titration.
C. Cryptococcus Antigen Titration:
1. Prepare serial dilutions of CSF in dilution buffer (1:2, 1:4, 1:8,
etc., up to 1:2048).
2. Add 50 µL of each diluted CSF sample to a corresponding well
on a latex agglutination slide.
3. Add 50 µL of latex reagent to each well containing diluted CSF.
4. Mix gently and incubate for 5 minutes at room temperature.
5. Observe and record the highest dilution at which agglutination
remains visible.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results should be recorded in the laboratory information system
(LIS) immediately after assessment.
• Negative results should be reported as "Cryptococcus Antigen
Screen: Negative."
• Positive results should include both the initial screen positivity and
the titer, e.g., "Cryptococcus Antigen Screen: Positive, Titer:
1:128."
• All critical values should prompt immediate communication with
the requesting physician or clinical team.
7. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's insert for the Cryptococcus antigen latex
agglutination test.
• Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines for
cerebrospinal fluid testing.
• Laboratory's internal Quality Control and Testing documentation.
8. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If controls fail, ensure reagents are not expired and that there has
been no procedural deviation.
• Repeat the test with new controls or a fresh specimen if
necessary.
• Document any procedural deviations and corrective actions.
This SOP must be reviewed annually or when significant procedural
changes occur. All personnel must receive appropriate training before
performing this test independently.
