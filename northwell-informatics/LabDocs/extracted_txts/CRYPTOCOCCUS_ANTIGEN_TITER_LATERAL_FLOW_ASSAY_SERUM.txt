Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Cryptococcus Antigen
Titer, Lateral Flow Assay (Serum)
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for performing the Cryptococcus Antigen
Titer, Lateral Flow Assay in serum samples to ensure consistency,
accuracy, and reproducibility of results.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of trained laboratory personnel to perform this
assay following the outlined procedure and to document all results
and any deviations from the protocol.
1. SPECIMEN
Specimen Requirements:
• Preferred: Freshly collected serum.
• Acceptable: Frozen serum samples if stored at -20°C or lower.
Sample Volume:
• Minimum volume: 100 µL.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
• Samples that have been stored at 2-8°C for more than 7 days.
• Samples with no clear labeling, missing collection date/time, or
compromised integrity (such as leaking containers).
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Micropipettes with sterile tips
• Vortex mixer
• Timer
• Lateral Flow Assay cassette reader (if applicable)
Reagents:
• Cryptococcus Antigen Lateral Flow Assay kits (e.g., IMMY CrAg
LFA)
• Positive and negative controls provided with the assay kit
• Buffer solution provided with the assay kit
Supplies:
• Sterile micropipette tips
• Disposable assay cassettes
• Laboratory marker
• Absorbent pads
• Gloves and other personal protective equipment (PPE)
1. PROCEDURE
A) Preparing the Work Area:
1. Clean the work surface with an appropriate disinfectant before
beginning the assay.
2. Gather all necessary equipment, reagents, and supplies.
3. Label the assay cassettes with the relevant sample identifiers.
B) Running the Assay:
1. Bring all reagents and serum samples to room temperature
(20-25°C) before starting the test.
2. Place the assay cassette on a flat, level surface.
3. Pipette 40 µL of sample buffer into the specimen well of the
cassette.
4. Add 40 µL of serum sample to the specimen well. Avoid
introducing air bubbles.
5. Mix gently using a pipette if required.
6. Start the timer immediately after adding the sample.
C) Incubation and Reading:
1. Allow the reaction to progress undisturbed for the time specified
by the assay kit (typically 10 minutes).
2. Examine the test and control lines visually. If using a cassette
reader, insert the cassette into the reader and follow the
manufacturer's instructions to obtain a reading.
3. Record the appearance of the lines according to the assay’s
instructions.
D) Interpretation of Results:
• Positive: Two lines appear - one in the control region (C) and one
in the test region (T).
• Negative: Only one line appears in the control region (C). No line
appears in the test region (T).
• Invalid: No line appears in the control region (C). The test should
be repeated with a new cassette.
E) Quality Control:
1. Run prepared positive and negative controls simultaneously
with each batch of samples.
2. If the controls do not perform as expected, do not report patient
results and investigate potential sources of error.
3. Document all quality control results and actions taken in case of
deviations.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
2. Document the assay results in the laboratory information
system (LIS).
3. Verify that the results meet the quality control criteria.
4. Communicate results to the relevant parties according to the
laboratory’s reporting guidelines.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Positive: Detectable Cryptococcus antigen.
• Negative: No detectable Cryptococcus antigen.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• The sensitivity and specificity of the assay may be impacted by
interfering substances in the serum.
• Cross-reactivity with other substances may produce false-positive
or false-negative results.
• Refer to the assay kit insert for detailed information on potential
interferences.
