Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Cryptococcus Antigen
Titer, Lateral Flow Assay, Spinal Fluid
1. PURPOSE
To provide standardized procedures for the testing and interpretation
of Cryptococcus Antigen Titer (CrAg), Lateral Flow Assay (LFA) in
spinal fluid. This test aids in the diagnosis of Cryptococcus
neoformans infection in spinal fluid samples.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to the analysis of spinal fluid specimens
received for the detection of Cryptococcus Antigen using a Lateral
Flow Assay.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
Laboratory staff trained in microbiological and immunoassay
techniques are responsible for performing the Cryptococcus LFA test,
ensuring adherence to this protocol, performing quality control, and
documenting results properly.
4. SPECIMEN
Preferred/Acceptable:
• Spinal fluid (CSF) collected and stored appropriately.
Unacceptable:
• Specimens with visible contamination.
• Specimens that have been stored at incorrect temperatures or
beyond the stability period.
5. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Cryptococcus Antigen Lateral Flow Test Kit (includes CrAg LFA
test strips, reagents, and controls)
• Micropipettes and pipette tips
• Timer
• Test tubes or reaction vials
• Sample collection and storage log
• Laboratory bench designated for LFA testing
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
6. SPECIMEN PREPARATION
1. Sample Handling:
◦ Ensure the spinal fluid sample is at room temperature prior
to testing.
◦ Gently mix the spinal fluid by inversion for a few seconds.
◦ Avoid bubble formation.
2. Preparation for Testing:
◦ Label test tubes or reaction vials for each sample to be
tested.
◦ Aliquot the required volume (as specified by the test kit
manufacturer) into labeled vials using a micropipette with a
sterile pipette tip.
7. TEST PROCEDURE
1. Preparation:
◦ Set up a clean workspace for the assay.
◦ Wear appropriate PPE.
◦ Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for the Cryptococcus
LFA kit strictly.
2. Test Execution:
◦ Reagent preparation: Reconstitute reagents if required by
the manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Pipette the designated volume of CSF sample into the
reaction vial.
◦ Add the specified volume of assay buffer to the reaction vial
and mix gently.
◦ Immerse the LFA test strip into the reaction vial ensuring
proper submersion of the strip’s reaction pad into the
mixture.
◦ Incubate the test strip for the duration specified by the
manufacturer (usually 10 minutes), ensuring the strip
remains immobile during the incubation period.
3. Result Interpretation:
◦ After the incubation period, read the test strip results within
the time frame specified by the manufacturer.
◦ Observe the presence of colored lines on the test strip.
Typically, results are interpreted as:
▪ Negative: One red line in the control region only.
▪ Positive: Two red lines, one in the control region and
one in the test region.
◦ Intensity of the test line may be used to estimate titer.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run a positive and a negative control with each batch of tests to
ensure the test reagents are functioning correctly.
• Document the control results in the QC log. Controls must fall
within the specified ranges to validate test results.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
• Document the sample identification number and corresponding
CrAg test results.
• Enter results into the laboratory information system (LIS) for
verification and review by a senior technologist or pathologist.
• Ensure correlating clinical information is reviewed before
releasing the results to ensure accurate diagnostic reporting.
10. REFERENCE INTERVALS:
Interpretation of results should include qualitative assessment:
• Negative Result: No Cryptococcus antigen detected.
• Positive Result: Cryptococcus antigen detected, suggestive of
cryptococcal infection.
11. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
• Cross-reactivity with other fungal antigens, though rare, may
affect specificity.
• Proper handling and timely testing of CSF samples are crucial.
Ensure diagnostics are corroborated with clinical findings and
other laboratory tests where appropriate.

13. ATTACHMENTS:
Include label examples, QC logs, and troubleshooting flowcharts.
14. RECORDING:
Date and initial all activities following documentation guidelines.
Ensure all laboratory personnel familiarize themselves with this SOP
and certify their understanding through appropriate training
documentation. This protocol aids in achieving consistent, accurate
diagnoses when evaluating suspected cases of Cryptococcus
infection using LFA testing in spinal fluids.
