Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for CRYPTOCOCCUS
ANTIGEN TITER, LATERAL FLOW ASSAY, URINE
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized protocol for the analytical phase of
generating results for Cryptococcus Antigen (CrAg) Titer in urine
using a Lateral Flow Assay (LFA).
2. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the test,
ensuring quality control, and documenting results in compliance with
the procedure outlined in this SOP.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred Specimen:
• 10 mL of urine, collected in a sterile container.
• Specimen must be received in the laboratory within 6 hours of
collection if kept at room temperature, or within 24 hours if
refrigerated.
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Specimen that has exceeded the acceptable time frame for
testing.
• Specimen without proper labeling, including collection date/time
and patient identification.
• Specimen with visible contamination or debris.
4. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• Cryptococcus Antigen Lateral Flow Assay Test Kit
• Sterile disposable pipettes
• Timer
• Urine sample in sterile container
• Control material (positive and negative)
Storage of Reagents:
• Store test kits at room temperature (15-30°C).
• Do not use reagents past their expiration date.
• Once opened, use test kit components within the timeframe
specified by the manufacturer.
5. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Allow all reagents and samples to reach room temperature
before testing.
2. Label the test devices with the patient's identification number.
Testing:
1. Sample Preparation:
◦ Mix the urine sample thoroughly by gentle inversion.
2. Testing Procedure: a. Peel off the foil pouch and remove the
Lateral Flow Assay device. b. Using a sterile pipette, add 50 µL
of the urine sample to the sample well on the LFA device. c.
Wait for 10 minutes (or the time specified by the manufacturer)
for the reaction to occur.
3. Reading Results:
◦ After the designated reaction time, visually inspect the LFA
device result window.
◦ Interpret the results according to the manufacturer’s
instructions:
▪ Positive Result: Presence of a test line and a control
line.
▪ Negative Result: Only a control line is visible.
▪ Invalid Result: No control line appears; repeat the test
with a new device.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run a positive and negative control with each batch of testing.
• Document control results on the Quality Control Log.
• If controls do not perform as expected, do not report patient
results. Troubleshoot and repeat the controls.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
• Record the test result in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Confirm and verify results by a designated technologist.
• Include the following in the report:
◦ Patient identification
◦ Test name and method (Lateral Flow Assay)
◦ Date and time of test
◦ Result (Positive/Negative/Invalid)
◦ Any pertinent comments or footnotes
8. SAMPLE INTEGRITY
• If sample integrity is in question (e.g., visible contamination,
unusual color), note this in the LIS and request a new sample.
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to the test kit insert for any specific limitations regarding
sensitivity, specificity, and potential interfering substances.
