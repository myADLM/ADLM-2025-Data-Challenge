SOP: Cryptococcus Antigen Testing with Reflex in Spinal Fluid
1. Purpose To provide a standardized procedure for the detection
of Cryptococcus antigen in spinal fluid (CSF) specimens with
reflex to further testing if necessary. This protocol ensures
accurate and timely results for the detection of Cryptococcus
infection.
2. Specimen Requirements
◦ Type: Spinal fluid (CSF)
◦ Collection: CSF should be collected via sterile lumbar
puncture technique.
◦ Volume: A minimum of 1 mL is necessary for testing.
◦ Stability: Specimens should be stored at 2-8°C and are
stable for up to 48 hours. Specimens not tested within this
period must be kept frozen at -20°C for extended storage.
3. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies
◦ Cryptococcal Antigen Test Kit
◦ PBS (Phosphate-buffered saline)
◦ Pipettes and tips (sterile)
◦ Microcentrifuge tubes
◦ Calibrated micropipettes
◦ Vortex mixer
◦ Refrigerated centrifuge
◦ Refrigerator/freezer (-20°C)
◦ Personal protective equipment (PPE)
4. Quality Control Quality control should be performed with each
new batch of reagents or upon opening a new vial of antigen
test reagent using positive and negative control samples
provided by the manufacturer. Record and review results
according to site-specific guidelines.
5. Procedure A. Preliminary Testing 1. Allow all reagents and
specimens to reach room temperature before testing. 2. Vortex
the specimen thoroughly for 5-10 seconds. 3. Label the test
tubes or microcentrifuge tubes clearly. 4. Add 100 µL of PBS to
the labeled test tube, allowing for control samples. 5. Using a
calibrated micropipette, add 100 µL of CSF to the same test
tube and mix by vortexing. 6. Follow manufacturer instructions
for the Cryptococcal Antigen Test Kit: a. Add reagents as
specified: antibody reagent, wash buffer, etc. b. Incubate as per
kit instructions. c. Read results based on specified incubation
period.
B. Reflex Testing The reflex testing is conducted if the
preliminary test is positive. 1. Using a new labeled test tube,
repeat steps 4 and 5 with fresh aliquots of the specimen. 2.
Upon confirmation, additional reflex testing may include: a.
Quantitative antigen titration following manufacturer
instructions. b. Culture for Cryptococcus species if indicated.
6. Reporting Results
◦ Results are to be read and documented by the performing
technologist.
◦ Positive results should be followed with a reflex test and
additional confirmatory testing as indicated.
◦ All results, including reflex tests, are to be reviewed and
verified according to site-specific guidelines and transmitted
to the LIS for inclusion in the patient's report.
7. Reference Intervals
◦ Cryptococcal Antigen Results: Negative (no detectable
antigen) - Positive (detectable antigen present)
8. Critical Results Critical results indicating the presence of
Cryptococcus antigen should be immediately reported to the
attending physician or clinical team.
◦ Any positive result from the initial or reflex testing must
follow specific alert protocols per institution guidelines.
9. Method Limitations
◦ Refer to Cryptococcal Antigen Test Kit insert for individual
reagent and test limitations.
◦ False-positive/false-negative results may occur due to
specimen contamination or improper handling.

By adhering to the above protocol, laboratory staff will ensure
consistent and reliable detection of Cryptococcus antigen in spinal
fluid specimens, facilitating prompt and accurate clinical diagnoses.
