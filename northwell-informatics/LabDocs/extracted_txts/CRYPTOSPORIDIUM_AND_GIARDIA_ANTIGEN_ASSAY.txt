Protocol for Cryptosporidium and Giardia Antigen Assay
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this Standard Operating Procedure
(SOP) is to outline the analytical phase for generating results from
the Cryptosporidium and Giardia Antigen Assay. This procedure
ensures the accurate and reliable detection of Cryptosporidium and
Giardia antigens in patient specimens.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred/acceptable:
◦ Fresh fecal specimen collected in a clean, leak-proof
container.
◦ Specimens should be transported to the laboratory promptly
and kept at refrigerated temperature (2-8°C) if there is a delay
in processing within 24 hours.
• Unacceptable:
◦ Specimens in preservatives other than formalin or zinc-based
preservative.
◦ Specimens with inadequate volume for testing.
◦ Specimens improperly labeled or leaking.
◦ Specimens that have been frozen and thawed more than
once.
3. PROCEDURE a. Preparation and Reagent Handling:
1. Verify the expiry date of all reagents and ensure they have
been stored according to the manufacturer's instructions.
2. Bring reagents and specimens to room temperature before
initiating the assay.
3. Follow manufacturer’s instructions for preparing the reagents
and handling specimens.
b. Equipment:
1. Cryptosporidium and Giardia Antigen Assay kit.
2. Pipettes and tips.
3. Microplate reader calibrated for absorbance at the appropriate
wavelength specified by the test kit.
4. Timer.
5. Laboratory thermometer to ensure room temperature is within
target range.
c. Assay Procedure:
1. Thoroughly mix the specimen by vortexing or inverting.
2. Prepare the assay workspace, ensuring it is free from
contamination.
3. Follow the manufacturer's detailed instructions for the number
of wells to be utilized and the volume of reagents to be added
per well.
4. Add the correct volume of fecal sample to the designated wells,
ensuring precision.
5. Add the conjugate reagent (manufacturer specified) and
incubate the microplate for the recommended time at room
temperature.
6. Wash the wells according to the manufacturer's protocol,
ensuring proper removal of unbound components.
7. Add substrate solution and incubate as directed by the test
instructions.
8. Stop the reaction using the prescribed stop solution.
9. Measure the absorbance of each well using the calibrated
microplate reader.
10. Record all absorbance values accurately for result
interpretation.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run positive and negative controls with each batch of samples to
ensure assay integrity.
• Review QC material logs for acceptability.
• If QC materials fall outside acceptable ranges, do not release
patient results, troubleshoot the assay, and repeat QC measures.
5. REPORTING RESULTS
• Analyze absorbance readings based on the manufacturer’s
guidelines to determine positive or negative results for
Cryptosporidium and Giardia antigens.
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Verify each result against quality controls before final reporting.
• Notify the supervisor regarding any ambiguous results or assay
issues.
6. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Negative: Absorbance values below the cut-off range as specified
by the manufacturer.
• Positive: Absorbance values above the cut-off range specified by
the manufacturer.
7. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to assay manufacturer’s insert for individual reagent
limitations.
• Hemolyzed, contaminated, or improperly preserved specimens
may interfere with results.
8. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s product insert and instruction manual.
• Laboratory guidelines for handling, storage, and disposal of
biohazard materials.
9. DOCUMENTATION
• Maintain records of specimen identification, results, reagent lot
numbers, date, time, temperatures, and technologist initials in the
laboratory log.
• Document any deviations from the protocol and corrective actions
taken.
By adhering to this SOP, staff can ensure consistent, accurate, and
reliable detection of Cryptosporidium and Giardia antigens, thereby
providing valuable diagnostic information for patient care.
