SOP for Analytical Phase of Generating Results for
CRYPTOSPORIDIUM ANTIGEN, FECES
1. PURPOSE
To provide standardized procedures for the accurate and timely
detection of Cryptosporidium antigen in fecal samples using an
immunoassay method.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing the
assay, recording results, and taking appropriate action if any
anomalies occur.
3. SPECIMEN
• Preferred/acceptable: Fresh or preserved stool samples. The
sample should be collected in a clean, leak-proof container.
• Unacceptable: Specimens contaminated with urine or other
foreign substances, improperly labeled or severely delayed in
transport leading to potential degradation.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Equipment: Microplate reader, pipettes, and timer
• Reagents: Cryptosporidium antigen test kit including microplates,
wash buffer, detection antibody, substrate solution, and stop
solution.
• Supplies: Microplate strips or wells, sterile sample containers,
disposable pipette tips, laboratory bench liners, and absorbent
paper.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
• Use positive and negative controls provided with the test kit with
each batch of tests.
• Control samples must fall within the expected range before
sample results are reported.
• Document all quality control results and corrective actions taken.
6. PROCEDURE
1. Preparation:
◦ Bring all reagents and specimens to room temperature
(20-25°C) before beginning the assay.
◦ Mix all reagents and samples gently by inversion before
use.
◦ Label all test strips or wells clearly.
2. Specimen Preparation:
◦ For fresh stool samples: Prepare a stool suspension using
the buffer provided in the kit as per the manufacturer's
instructions.
◦ For preserved samples: Follow the manufacturer's
guidelines for processing preserved stool specimens.
3. Assay Procedure:
◦ Add a specified volume (usually 1-2 drops or ~50-100 μL) of
stool suspension or control sample to each designated well.
◦ Add specified volumes of the antibody and other reagents
according to the manufacturer's instructions.
◦ Incubate the plate for the specified time at room
temperature (usually 30-60 minutes), avoiding direct
sunlight or drafts.
◦ Wash the wells thoroughly as per the described procedure
in the kit to remove any unbound substances.
◦ Add the substrate solution to each well and incubate in the
dark for the recommended time (typically 10-30 minutes).
◦ Add the stop solution to each well to halt the enzyme
reaction.
4. Reading and Interpretation:
◦ Read the optical density (OD) at the specified wavelength
(typically 450 nm) using the microplate reader immediately
after stopping the reaction.
◦ Interpret the results based on the cutoff values provided by
the test kit:
▪ Positive: OD values higher than the cutoff indicating the
presence of Cryptosporidium antigen.
▪ Negative: OD values lower than the cutoff indicating the
absence of Cryptosporidium antigen.
▪ Invalid: Control wells failing to meet quality control
criteria or samples showing unclear results needing
retesting.
5. Reporting:
◦ Enter the results into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS) for review and validation by a qualified technologist.
◦ Indicate if a repeat or further testing is required based on
the control results or sample integrity.
7. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Positive: Presence of Cryptosporidium antigen.
• Negative: Absence of Cryptosporidium antigen.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• False positives may occur due to cross-reactivity with other
protozoan antigens.
• Extremely low levels of antigen may result in false negatives.
• Samples with improper collection or storage may yield incorrect
results.
9. CORRECTIVE ACTIONS
• If quality control fails, recheck the reagents and protocol steps to
identify and rectify the issue.
• Reassay samples if necessary, using new reagents or alternate
kits.
• Document any deviations from standard procedure and the steps
taken to correct them.
