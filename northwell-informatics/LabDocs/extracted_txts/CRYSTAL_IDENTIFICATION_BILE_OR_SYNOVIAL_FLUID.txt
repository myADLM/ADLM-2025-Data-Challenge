1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedure for identifying
crystals in bile or synovial fluid to ensure accuracy and consistency in
test results.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of the designated medical laboratory scientist to
perform the crystal identification procedure according to the outlined
protocol. It is also their responsibility to document the results and
report any deviations or issues to a supervisor.
1. DEFINITION
Crystal identification involves the microscopic analysis of bile or
synovial fluid to detect the presence of crystals, which can aid in
diagnosing various conditions such as cholelithiasis or gout.
1. PROCEDURE
Specimen Requirements:
• Specimen Type: Bile or synovial fluid.
• Collection: Specimens must be collected in sterile containers
using aseptic technique.
• Volume: A minimum of 1mL of fluid is recommended.
• Timing: Specimens should be analyzed as soon as possible to
prevent degradation or alteration of crystal morphology.
A) Sample Preparation:
1. Ensure the specimen is well-mixed before preparation to
disperse any crystals uniformly.
2. If the sample has been refrigerated, bring it to room
temperature prior to analysis.
3. Centrifuge the specimen at 1500-2000 RPM for 5 minutes to
concentrate any crystals present.
4. Using a sterile pipette, place a drop of the sediment onto a
clean glass slide.
5. Cover with a coverslip, ensuring no air bubbles are trapped.
B) Microscopic Examination:
1. Examine the slide under a bright field microscope at low (10x)
and high power (40x) magnification.
2. Use polarized light microscopy to enhance the visibility of
birefringent crystals.
3. Identify the type of crystals present (e.g., monosodium urate,
calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate, cholesterol) by their shape,
size, and birefringence properties.
4. Note the presence of any inflammatory cells or microorganisms
that may be seen within the sample.
C) Identification and Documentation:
1. Document the type, quantity, and morphology of crystals
observed.
2. Record any additional findings such as the presence of
inflammatory cells or microorganisms.
3. Use the Crystal Identification Report form to log the results,
including the patient ID, date and time of analysis, and the
initials of the technician performing the test.
4. Report any unusual findings or discrepancies to the supervising
medical laboratory scientist for further review.
D) Quality Control:
1. Use known crystal control slides periodically to ensure accurate
identification.
2. Participate in external proficiency testing programs if available.
3. Keep records of quality control checks and maintain a logbook
for any corrective actions taken.
E) Reporting Results:
1. Enter the results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
for review and verification by the supervising technologist.
2. Generate a report that includes a detailed description of the
crystals identified and any other pertinent findings.
3. Release the verified results to the requesting physician or
clinical team.
F) Method Limitations:
1. Ensure prompt analysis to avoid crystal dissolution or
transformation.
2. Be aware of potential interference from artifacts that may mimic
crystal appearance.
3. Repeat analysis if specimen integrity is in doubt.
