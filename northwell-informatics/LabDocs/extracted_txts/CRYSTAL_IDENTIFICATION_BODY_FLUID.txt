Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) for Crystal Identification
in Body Fluids
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the procedure for the identification of crystals in
body fluids (e.g., synovial fluid) using polarized light microscopy.
Accurate identification of crystals is essential for the diagnosis and
management of various medical conditions such as gout or
pseudogout.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to laboratory personnel qualified to perform
and interpret microscopic analyses of body fluid specimens for the
presence of crystals.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing crystal
identification and documenting the results. Supervisors are
responsible for ensuring that staff adhere to this procedure and for
addressing any issues that may arise during analysis.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred: Fresh, non-heparinized body fluid specimen.
• Volume required: Minimum of 0.5 mL for comprehensive analysis.
• Storage: Specimens should be kept refrigerated (2-8°C) if not
analyzed immediately and must be analyzed within 6 hours of
collection.
• Unacceptable specimens: Specimens in sodium citrate, EDTA, or
sodium fluoride/oxalate containers, specimens with significant
hemolysis, specimens with clots, or specimens with insufficient
volume.
5. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
• Polarized light microscope with compensator
• Glass slides and cover slips
• Disposable pipettes
• Centrifuge (if required)
• Sterile collection tubes
• QC material for equipment calibration
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
6. REAGENTS
• Fresh body fluid specimen
• Saline (0.9% NaCl) if dilution is necessary
• Optional stains (e.g., Wright stain) for enhanced visualization
7. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Don PPE including lab coat, gloves, and safety goggles.
2. Confirm sample identity and suitability according to specimen
requirements.
3. Ensure the polarized light microscope is properly calibrated and
check the alignment of the polarizer and analyzer.
Preparation of Sample:
1. Gently mix the body fluid specimen to ensure uniform
distribution of crystals.
2. Using a sterile pipette, place a drop of the specimen onto a
glass slide.
3. Cover the specimen drop with a cover slip to prevent drying out.
Microscopic Examination: 4. Place the prepared slide under the
microscope. 5. Begin examination with the 10x objective lens and
then switch to higher magnification (40x or 100x) as necessary. 6.
Adjust the polarizer and analyzer components to visualize
birefringent crystals. 7. Document any findings with respect to type,
size, shape, and location of the crystals. - Typical crystals include
monosodium urate (MSU) for gout and calcium pyrophosphate
dihydrate (CPPD) for pseudogout. 8. If necessary, confirm
identification with compensated polarized light microscopy to
differentiate between crystalline structures.
Additional Techniques: 9. Optional staining for enhanced view of
crystals using Wright stain or other suitable stains. 10. Perform a cell
count and differential if additionally requested by the physician.
Reporting Results: 11. Document the findings including the type of
crystals, their characteristics, and the presence of any other
significant observations such as amorphous precipitations or
bacteria. 12. Review the microscopy results ensuring they are
accurate and complete before verification. 13. Enter results into the
LIS (Laboratory Information System) promptly for review and
electronic transmission to the requesting physician.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
• Ensure equipment maintenance and calibration are performed
regularly according to the manufacturer’s guidelines.
• Perform regular intralab comparisons using QC material (e.g.,
control slides with known crystal types).
• Validate and record all findings against control slides.
• Perform parallel testing with experienced personnel for cases
involving ambiguous results.
9. SAFETY
• Follow all laboratory safety guidelines including proper handling of
body fluids and disposal of biohazard materials.
• Use appropriate PPE to prevent exposure to potentially infectious
materials.
10. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Crystals may dissolve or be less visible in improperly stored
specimens.
• Heavy hemolysis or particulate matter may obscure the view of
crystals.
• Small sample volume may limit the ability to provide a
comprehensive analysis.
