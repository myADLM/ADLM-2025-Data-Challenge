Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for CSTB Gene, Repeat
Expansion Analysis
1. PURPOSE
This procedure outlines the protocol for the analytical phase of
generating results for CSTB gene, repeat expansion analysis,
ensuring accuracy and consistency in results.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel responsible for
performing CSTB gene repeat expansion analysis.
3. RESPONSIBILITIES
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for carrying out the
analysis and verifying the results. All personnel must ensure that the
SOP is followed and any deviations are reported to the supervisor.
4. MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT
• Thermal cycler
• Electrophoresis system (e.g., agarose gel electrophoresis)
• Pipettes and tips
• PCR reagents (Taq polymerase, dNTPs, primers specific for
CSTB repeat region)
• DNA extraction kits
• Gel documentation system
• Gloves, lab coat, and other PPE
5. SPECIMEN
• Acceptable: Extracted genomic DNA from blood or other validated
sources.
• Volume: Minimum 10-50 ng of DNA.
• Storage: DNA should be stored at -20°C until analysis.
6. PROCEDURE
A. DNA Extraction:
• Extract DNA from the specimen using a validated DNA extraction
kit.
• Quantify the DNA concentration using a spectrophotometer or
fluorometer.
B. PCR Amplification:
• Prepare the PCR reaction mix according to the following table:
| Component | Volume per Reaction |
|----------------------|---------------------| | DNA template | 2 µL (10-50
ng) | | Forward primer | 0.5 µL (10 µM) | | Reverse primer | 0.5 µL
(10 µM) | | dNTPs (10 mM each) | 1 µL | | 10X PCR buffer | 2.5 µL
| | MgCl2 (25 mM) | 1.5 µL | | Taq polymerase (5 U/µL)| 0.3 µL | |
Nuclease-free water | To 25 µL total |
• Mix thoroughly and aliquot 25 µL of the reaction mix into PCR
tubes.
• Amplify using the following cycling conditions:
◦ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 5 minutes
◦ 35 cycles of:
▪ Denaturation: 95°C for 30 seconds
▪ Annealing: 58°C for 30 seconds
▪ Extension: 72°C for 1 minute
◦ Final extension: 72°C for 7 minutes
◦ Hold: 4°C
C. Electrophoresis:
• Prepare a 2% agarose gel with appropriate stain (e.g., ethidium
bromide).
• Load 5 µL of PCR product mixed with 2 µL of loading dye into the
wells.
• Run the gel at 100V for 30-45 minutes or until separation is
adequate.
D. Documentation and Analysis:
• Visualize the PCR products under UV light using a gel
documentation system.
• Compare the band sizes to a DNA ladder to determine repeat
expansion sizes.
• Record and verify results according to laboratory protocols.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include positive and negative controls in each PCR run to ensure
the validity of the results.
• Document any deviations from the SOP and report to the
supervisor.
• Adhere to calibration and maintenance schedules for all
equipment.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Review and verify results against the accepted criteria and
reference ranges.
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
following site-specific guidelines.
• Any critical or unusual results should be reported immediately to
the ordering physician.
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to the PCR reagent manufacturer's insert for any limitations
regarding primer specificity, amplification efficiency, or reagent
stability.
10. REFERENCES
• Primer sequences and cycling conditions adapted from
established literature.
• Manufacturer's instructions for DNA extraction kits, PCR reagents,
and Taq polymerase.
11. REVIEW AND DOCUMENTATION
• This SOP will be reviewed annually and updated as necessary.
• Amendments must be approved by the laboratory supervisor or
director.
By following this SOP, laboratory personnel will ensure accurate and
reliable analysis of CSTB gene repeat expansions, contributing to
high-quality patient care.
