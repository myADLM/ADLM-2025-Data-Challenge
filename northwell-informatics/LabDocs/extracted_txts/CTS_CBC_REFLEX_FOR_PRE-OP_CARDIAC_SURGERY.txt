1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this protocol is to outline the standard operating
procedures for the analytical phase in generating results for the CBC
Reflex for Pre-Op Cardiac Surgery. Accurate and timely test results
are critical for assessing the patient’s readiness for cardiac surgery
and identifying any potential complications that may require medical
interventions.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type: Whole blood. Collection Container: EDTA (lavender-
top) tube. Volume: Minimum 2 mL of whole blood. Handling: Mix
gently by inversion 8-10 times immediately after collection to prevent
clotting. Transport: Specimens should be transported to the
laboratory at room temperature (20-25°C). Stability: Specimens are
stable for up to 24 hours at room temperature. If delayed longer than
24 hours, refrigerate at 2-8°C to maintain stability up to 48 hours.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Automated Hematology Analyzer (e.g., Sysmex XN-Series, Beckman
Coulter LH-Series). Control materials: Commercially available
controls at two or three levels. Reagents: Specific reagents for the
hematology analyzer, according to manufacturer’s instructions.
Personal protective equipment (PPE): Gloves, lab coat, and safety
goggles.
1. PROCEDURE
4.1 Calibration and Quality Control
Daily calibration and quality control checks must be performed: Run
three-level controls (low, normal, high) at the beginning of each day.
Verify control results against the established acceptable ranges.
Document all control results. If controls are out of range, troubleshoot
according to the analyzer’s manual before processing patient
samples.
4.2 Sample Processing
Label the EDTA tube with unique patient identifiers. Mix the specimen
by gentle inversion at least 8-10 times. Place the specimen on the
sample rack of the automated hematology analyzer. Select the
appropriate testing mode (CBC) on the analyzer’s control panel. Load
the sample rack onto the analyzer and initiate the run.
4.3 Reflex Testing
Reflex testing will be automatically triggered based on initial CBC
results: If any critical values or flagged parameters (e.g., hemoglobin
<10 g/dl, platelet count <50,000/μL) are detected, repeat analysis on
a fresh aliquot of the same specimen. Perform manual differential
count if flagged by the automated analyzer or as per predefined
reflex criteria (e.g., presence of blasts, nucleated red blood cells).
Document the reflex testing results along with the original CBC
results.
4.4 Result Documentation and Review
All CBC and reflex results will be reviewed by a trained technologist.
Verify that quality control results for that testing period are within
acceptable ranges. Enter the test results into the Laboratory
Information System (LIS) for review by the supervising pathologist.
1. CRITICAL RESULTS AND REPORTING
Notify the responsible physician immediately for any critical results
following institutional policies. Critical values include but are not
limited to: Hemoglobin (Hgb) < 7 g/dL. Hematocrit (Hct) < 21%.
Platelet count < 50,000/μL or > 1,000,000/μL. White blood cell count
(WBC) < 2,000/μL or > 50,000/μL. Document the call and details of
the notification including the name of the person notified, time, and
date.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Improper specimen collection, handling, or transport can affect test
results. Certain drugs or patient conditions may affect the accuracy of
the results. Refer to the analyzer’s manual for specific limitations.
Hemolysis, clotted samples, or insufficient volume can cause
erroneous results. Reject such specimens and request a new
sample.
1. QUALITY CONTROL AND MAINTENANCE
Follow established schedules for preventive maintenance of the
hematology analyzer as per the manufacturer's guidelines. Document
all maintenance activities (e.g., cleaning, calibration) in the
equipment logbook. Ensure periodic proficiency testing and
participate in external quality assurance programs.

End of Protocol
This protocol is to ensure reliability and accuracy in generating critical
CBC results necessary for the pre-operative assessment of cardiac
surgery patients. All personnel should be familiar with these
procedures and conduct testing accordingly.
