Title: Analytical Phase Protocol for Generating Results for
CUCUMBER, IGE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
To establish a standardized procedure for the analysis of serum
immunoglobulin E (IgE) specific to Cucumber allergen, ensuring
accurate, reliable, and reproducible results. This protocol covers the
handling, preparation, and analysis of serum samples for Cucumber
IgE quantification.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for processing and
analyzing the serum samples according to this protocol. It is the
responsibility of the staff to identify any deficiencies or irregularities
during the analytical phase and report them to the supervisor.
1. SPECIMEN
Preferred/acceptable:
• Serum collected in red-top or gold-top (SST) vacutainer tubes.
• Properly labeled with patient identification, collection date, and
time.
• Specimen should be centrifuged and separated within 2 hours of
collection.
Unacceptable:
• Specimens collected in tubes with additives such as EDTA or
heparin.
• Specimens with visible hemolysis, lipemia, or contamination.
• Specimens without proper labeling or collected more than 48
hours prior to analysis.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• ELISA plate reader
• Pipettes and tips
• Microcentrifuge
• Serum separator tubes (SST)
• Specific IgE assay kit for Cucumber (Manufacturer-specific, e.g.,
Thermo Fisher Scientific Phadia ImmunoCAP)
• Calibrators and controls specific for Cucumber IgE
• Wash buffer
• Incubator
1. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation:
1. Centrifuge serum separator tubes at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes.
2. Carefully aspirate the serum without disturbing the cell layer
and transfer to a clean microcentrifuge tube.
3. Store serum samples at 2-8°C for up to 48 hours or freeze at
-20°C or lower for longer storage.
B. Assay Setup:
1. Prepare reagents and assay components according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
2. Label the ELISA plate wells for calibrators, controls, and patient
samples.
3. Add appropriate volume of serum samples, calibrators, and
controls to the designated wells.
4. Follow the incubation steps, including incubation times and
temperatures as specified in the assay kit instructions.
C. Washing and Detection:
1. Wash the plate wells according to the manufacturer's
instructions to remove unbound substances.
2. Add detection reagents as specified, including enzyme
conjugate and substrate solution.
3. Incubate for the times specified in the manufacturer's
instructions.
D. Reading and Interpretation:
1. Measure the absorbance at the appropriate wavelength using
the ELISA plate reader.
2. Record the absorbance values and calculate the Cucumber IgE
concentrations using the provided standard curve.
3. Compare patient sample values to reference ranges and
interpret results.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
Material:
• Commercially prepared quality control samples (e.g., low,
medium, and high Cucumber IgE concentrations)
Procedure:
1. Run quality control samples with each assay batch.
2. Ensure that quality control samples are within the expected
range.
3. Document all quality control results and actions taken for out-of-
range controls.
4. REPORTING RESULTS
5. Enter the Cucumber IgE concentrations into the Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
6. Review and verify results according to internal guidelines.
7. Report any critical values to the ordering physician according to
established procedures.
Reference Intervals: Refer to manufacturer-specific guidelines and
published reference ranges for Cucumber IgE.
Method Limitations: Refer to the assay kit insert for specific
limitations, including interfering substances and assay sensitivity.

Review and Approval: This protocol should be reviewed annually and
revised as necessary to ensure compliance with regulatory standards
and advances in technology.
