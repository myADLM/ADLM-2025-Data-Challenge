Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Cucumber IgG
1. PURPOSE
To outline the standardized procedure for analyzing and generating
results for Cucumber IgG (Immunoglobulin G) in patient serum
samples using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
method.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel trained and
authorized to conduct the Cucumber IgG analysis within the
laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated Laboratory Staff:
• Perform Cucumber IgG analysis as per this SOP.
• Ensure proper calibration and maintenance of the ELISA reader
and washer.
• Document the results and any deviations from the procedure
accurately.
• Report any issues, errors, or deviations to a supervisor
immediately.
Supervisors:
• Ensure all designated laboratory staff are adequately trained.
• Periodically review documentation and compliance with this SOP.
• Address any procedural deficiencies or equipment malfunctions
promptly.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Human Serum
• Collection:
◦ Use a plain red-top tube for serum collection.
◦ Collect at least 5 mL of blood to obtain an adequate volume of
serum.
• Storage:
◦ Store serum samples at 2-8°C if analyzed within 48 hours.
◦ For longer storage, aliquot serum into appropriately labeled
cryovials and freeze at -20°C or colder.
5. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
• ELISA plate reader
• ELISA plate washer
• Pipettes and tips (calibrated)
• Cucumber IgG ELISA kit (including microtitre plates pre-coated
with Cucumber antigen)
• Plate sealer
• Incubator (37°C)
• Deionized water
• Wash buffer (as specified in the kit)
• Substrate solution
• Stop solution
• Microcentrifuge tubes
• Absorbent paper
6. REAGENTS PREPARATION
• Follow the manufacturer's guidelines for reconstituting and
preparing all reagents included in the Cucumber IgG ELISA kit.
• Prepare the wash buffer, substrate solution, and stop solution as
per the kit instructions.
• Ensure reagents are brought to room temperature before use.
7. PROCEDURE
Sample Preparation:
• Thaw frozen serum samples at room temperature.
• Centrifuge serum samples at 3000 rpm for 5 minutes to remove
any particulates.
Assay Procedure:
1. Coating and Blocking:
◦ Ensure the ELISA plate is properly labeled for sample
identification.
◦ Pipette 100 µL of diluted standards, controls, and patient
serum samples (diluted as per kit instructions) into the
appropriate wells.
◦ Incubate the plate at 37°C for 1 hour (or as specified in the
kit instructions).
2. Washing:
◦ After incubation, carefully aspirate the contents from the
wells.
◦ Wash the wells 3-5 times with 300 µL of wash buffer using
the ELISA washer (follow kit instructions for wash cycles).
3. Adding Conjugate:
◦ Add 100 µL of Enzyme-Conjugate solution to each well.
◦ Seal the plate with a plate sealer.
◦ Incubate the plate for 1 hour at 37°C.
4. Washing:
◦ Repeat the washing step as described above.
5. Substrate Reaction:
◦ Add 100 µL of substrate solution to each well.
◦ Incubate the plate in the dark at room temperature for 10-20
minutes (reference kit instructions for exact time).
6. Stopping the Reaction:
◦ Add 100 µL of stop solution to each well to halt the enzyme-
substrate reaction.
7. Reading the Plate:
◦ Read the absorbance (OD value) of each well using an
ELISA plate reader at 450 nm (or kit-specified wavelength).
8. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run positive and negative controls with each assay batch.
• Ensure that the OD values of controls fall within the acceptable
range specified by the kit.
• Repeat the assay if control values are outside the specified range.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
• Calculate the Cucumber IgG concentration in patient samples
using the standard curve generated from the OD values of the
standards.
• Include results in the laboratory information system (LIS) and
review for accuracy.
• Verify and validate the results as per the laboratory's quality
assurance protocol.
10. DOCUMENTATION
• Record the sample ID, reagent lot numbers, calibration details,
control results, and any deviations observed during the analysis.
• Maintain all documentation for a minimum of five years as per
regulatory requirements.
11. SAFETY
• Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) including
lab coat, gloves, and eye protection.
• Handle all specimens as potentially infectious.
• Dispose of all biohazardous materials (e.g., serum, used ELISA
plates) according to the laboratory's biohazard disposal
procedures.
