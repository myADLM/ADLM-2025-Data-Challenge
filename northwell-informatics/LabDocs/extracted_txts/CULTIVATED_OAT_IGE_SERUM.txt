analytical testing for Cultivated Oat, IgE, Serum samples.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Laboratory Technician: Responsible for performing the
analytical testing and initial data recording.
• Quality Control Officer: Responsible for verifying the accuracy
and completeness of the test results.
• Laboratory Supervisor: Responsible for overseeing the process,
addressing any issues, and ensuring compliance with regulations.
4. MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT
• Serum samples
• Immunoassay analyzer
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Calibrators and controls
• Reagents specific for Cultivated Oat, IgE testing
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
• Laboratory information system (LIS) for data recording
5. PROCEDURE
5.1 Preparation
1. Preparation of Reagents and Equipment:
◦ Ensure that all reagents are within their expiry dates and
have been stored as recommended.
◦ Calibrate the immunoassay analyzer according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Prepare calibrators and controls as per the manufacturer's
guidelines.
2. Sample Preparation:
◦ Centrifuge serum samples at 3000 RPM for 10 minutes to
obtain clear serum.
◦ Label all samples, calibrators, and controls clearly with
unique identifiers.
5.2 Analytical Testing
1. Loading Samples:
◦ Load serum samples, calibrators, and controls into the
designated positions on the immunoassay analyzer.
◦ Ensure that pipettes and tips are clean and functional.
2. Programming the Analyzer:
◦ Input relevant parameters for Cultivated Oat, IgE testing as
specified in the instrument manual.
◦ Verify and confirm settings such as sample volume,
incubation times, and measurement wavelengths.
3. Running the Test:
◦ Start the test run according to the analyzer's operation
manual.
◦ Monitor the entire process to ensure no deviations occur
and address any instrument alerts promptly.
5.3 Result Review and Verification
1. Quality Control:
◦ Analyze the quality control materials simultaneously with the
patient samples.
◦ Ensure that control results fall within the acceptable range
as defined by the laboratory's Standard Operating
Procedures.
2. Data Review:
◦ Verify the analyzer output for any flagged results or outliers.
◦ Cross-check results with control and calibrator readings to
ensure accuracy.
3. Issue Resolution:
◦ If any discrepancies are noted, rerun the test for the affected
samples.
◦ Document all reruns and their outcomes in the laboratory
log.
5.4 Result Reporting
1. Data Entry:
◦ Enter final results into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS), ensuring accurate transcription of data.
◦ Attach control run data for reference.
2. Validation of Results:
◦ The Quality Control Officer reviews and validates the results
in the LIS.
◦ The Laboratory Supervisor approves the final report for
release.
3. Report Generation:
◦ Generate and review the patient report, ensuring it is
complete with all necessary details.
◦ Transmit the approved and validated results to the
requesting physician or healthcare provider.
6. QUALITY CONTROL AND TROUBLESHOOTING
• Routine Checks:
◦ Perform routine maintenance and calibration of the
immunoassay analyzer.
◦ Ensure daily documentation of instrument performance
checks.
• Troubleshooting:
◦ Address any analyzer errors or deviations according to the
troubleshooting guidelines in the manufacturer's manual.
◦ Consult with the Laboratory Supervisor for persistent or
unresolved issues.
7. DOCUMENTATION
• Record all test runs, calibrations, quality control results, and
maintenance activities in the laboratory logbook.
• Maintain detailed records of any deviations, troubleshooting
actions, and corrective measures taken.
