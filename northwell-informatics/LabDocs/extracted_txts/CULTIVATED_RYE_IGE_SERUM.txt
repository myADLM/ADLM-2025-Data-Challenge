Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Cultivated Rye, IgE, Serum
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the necessary steps for the accurate and precise
analysis of Cultivated Rye, IgE, Serum samples, ensuring reliable
results. This includes handling, processing, and testing using the
appropriate laboratory instrumentation and techniques, as well as
documenting and reviewing results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all laboratory personnel performing
Cultivated Rye, IgE, Serum analysis to follow this SOP meticulously.
Laboratory supervisors are responsible for ensuring compliance with
this SOP and addressing any deviations accordingly.
3. DEFINITION
Cultivated Rye, IgE, Serum: A specific IgE test for measuring the
amount of immunoglobulin E specific to cultivated rye present in the
serum.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• ELISA (Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay) or automated
immunoassay analyzer suitable for IgE detection
• Serum separation tubes (SST)
• Calibrators and Controls (specific for Cultivated Rye, IgE)
• Micropipettes and tips
• Centrifuge
• Incubator (optional, as per chosen testing protocol)
• Patient serum samples
• Disposable gloves and lab coats
• Timer
• Logbooks and forms for documentation
5. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation
1. Sample Receipt and Verification: Upon receipt, verify that the
serum samples are properly labeled with patient identification
and the date of collection. Ensure that samples are transported
and stored at 2-8°C if not immediately processed.
2. Sample Centrifugation: Centrifuge serum separation tubes at
1500-2000 x g for 10 minutes to ensure clear separation of
serum from blood cells.
3. Sample Aliquoting: Carefully aliquot the serum into
appropriately labeled secondary containers if needed, avoiding
any mixing with cellular components. Store aliquots at 2-8°C
until analysis.
B. Calibration and Quality Control
1. Calibrator and Control Preparation: Prepare and handle
calibrators and controls as per the manufacturer's instructions.
Allow all reagents and samples to reach room temperature
(20-25°C) before use unless specified otherwise.
2. Quality Control Verification: Run quality control samples
before patient samples to ensure analyzer performance.
Acceptable ranges for control samples must be documented
and verified.
C. Assay Procedure with ELISA (Example Procedure)
1. Plate Preparation: Follow the ELISA kit-specific protocol to
coat microtiter plates with cultivated rye antigen, if using a
manual ELISA procedure. Pre-coated plates are also available
with certain kits.
2. Sample Addition: Add patient serum samples, calibrators, and
controls into the respective wells as dictated by the assay
protocol.
3. Incubation: Incubate the plate at the specified temperature and
for the recommended duration. Cover the plate to avoid
evaporation and contamination.
4. Washing: After incubation, wash the plate with buffered
solution as per kit instructions to remove unbound proteins.
5. Detection: Add detection antibodies, conjugates and substrates
sequentially as per protocol. Incubate and wash as required.
6. Reading: Measure absorbance at the specified wavelength
using a microplate reader.
D. Assay Procedure with Automated Immunoassay Analyzer
(Example Procedure)
1. Loading Samples: Load patient serum samples, calibrators,
and controls onto the automated immunoassay analyzer.
2. Programming and Running the Assay: Select the appropriate
assay (Cultivated Rye, IgE) on the analyzer. Ensure all
necessary settings and reagent kits for IgE analysis are
correctly loaded and selected.
3. Starting the Assay: Initiate the assay run according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
E. Result Interpretation
1. Data Review: Analyze and review data generated to distinguish
between positive and negative IgE responses to cultivated rye.
2. Quality Check: Ensure all controls are within specified limits.
Reject any run if controls fail and troubleshoot as necessary.
3. Result Calculation: Use the analyzer software or ELISA kit
instructions to calculate IgE concentration in patient serum
samples.
F. Reporting Results
1. Documentation: Document all results in the Laboratory
Information System (LIS) ensuring patient confidentiality is
maintained.
2. Verification: Review and verify results before reporting.
Investigate and re-test if unexpected results are found.
3. Critical Results: Immediately notify the requesting physician of
any critical IgE results and document the communication.
6. QUALITY CONTROL AND TROUBLESHOOTING
1. Regular Maintenance: Perform regular calibration,
maintenance, and cleaning of analyzers and equipment as per
the manufacturer's guidelines.
2. Troubleshooting: Follow troubleshooting guidelines for any
equipment malfunctions or QC failures. Consult the equipment
manual and seek technical support if required.
7. SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS
1. Personal Protective Equipment (PPE): Always wear
disposable gloves, lab coats, and safety glasses when handling
specimens and reagents.
2. Waste Disposal: Dispose of all biological waste and sharps
according to the laboratory's biosafety protocols.
