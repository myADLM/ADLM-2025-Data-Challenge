Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Generating Results for
Cultivated Wheat, IgE, Serum
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the standardized procedure for
generating quantitative results for Cultivated Wheat, IgE, Serum in a
clinical laboratory setting.
Responsibility:
• The designated laboratory personnel are responsible for
performing the assay and generating results as defined in this
procedure.
• It is the responsibility of the laboratory supervisor to ensure the
procedure is followed correctly and results are reviewed in a
timely manner.
1. PRINCIPLE AND/OR PURPOSE
The principle of the test is the quantitative determination of IgE
antibodies specific to Cultivated Wheat in human serum by utilizing
an ImmunoCAP system, an enzyme immunoassay (EIA). This
protocol ensures accurate and reliable measurement of allergen-
specific IgE antibodies.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred Specimen:
• Two 5 mL red-top serum separator tubes (SST).
Handling and Stability:
• Serum samples are to be separated from the clot within 2 hours of
collection.
• Store serum samples at 2-8°C if testing occurs within 7 days. For
longer storage, serum should be stored at -20°C or colder.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• ImmunoCAP 250/1000/900 Analyzer
• Centrifuge
• Micropipettes
• Refrigerator (2-8°C)
• Freezer (-20°C or colder)
Reagents and Supplies:
• ImmunoCAP Allergen Component (Cultivated Wheat) kit
• Quality control materials
• Calibration materials
• Consumables: Tips, tubes, gloves, lab coats
1. PROCEDURE
2. Preparation:
◦ Thaw frozen serum samples at room temperature.
◦ Mix samples gently but thoroughly by inversion.
3. Loading the Analyzer:
◦ Ensure the ImmunoCAP system is powered on and
prepared for analysis.
◦ Load the Cultivated Wheat Allergen Component kit onto the
analyzer.
◦ Perform an initial calibration using the calibration materials
provided in the kit.
4. Sample Processing:
◦ Spin down serum samples at 2,000 – 3,000 x g for 10
minutes to ensure separation from any particulate matter.
◦ Load the clear serum sample onto the ImmunoCAP system,
adhering to the manufacturer’s instructions.
5. Assay Execution:
◦ The ImmunoCAP system will automatically process the
samples using the pre-set program for Cultivated Wheat,
IgE, and generate results.
◦ Ensure that all samples are processed within the run validity
period as per the manufacturer’s recommendations.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
7. Internal Quality Control:
◦ Run quality control materials with known IgE concentrations
to ensure the accuracy and reliability of test results. Perform
QC assays:
▪ At the beginning of each day of testing.
▪ With each new batch of test kits.
◦ Record and review QC results. Results must be within the
manufacturer’s specified ranges.
◦ If QC fails, investigate the cause, recalibrate the instrument,
and repeat the QC checks before proceeding with patient
samples.
8. External Quality Control:
◦ Participate in external proficiency testing programs to
compare laboratory performance with peer laboratories.
9. RESULT REPORTING
10. Data Verification:
◦ Review and validate all test results for accuracy.
◦ Verify that QC results are within acceptable ranges before
reporting any patient results.
11. Result Interpretation:
◦ Reported IgE concentration (kU/L) signifies the level of IgE
antibodies specific to Cultivated Wheat.
◦ Reference intervals should be included in the results report
with the following interpretation guide:
▪ <0.1 kU/L: Negative
▪ 0.1 - 0.34 kU/L: Borderline/Equivocal
▪ ≥0.35 kU/L: Positive (clinical significance subject to
patient-specific context)
12. Transmission of Results:
◦ Transfer confirmed results to the Laboratory Information
System (LIS) for release.
◦ Ensure results are available for clinical review and patient
management.
13. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Negative: <0.1 kU/L
• Borderline/Equivocal: 0.1 - 0.34 kU/L
• Positive: ≥0.35 kU/L
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Cross-reactivity: Possible cross-reactivity with other cereal grains
or grasses may occur. Interpret results in conjunction with patient
clinical history and other diagnostic tests.
• Sample Integrity: Hemolysis, lipemia, and microbial contamination
can affect assay results.
