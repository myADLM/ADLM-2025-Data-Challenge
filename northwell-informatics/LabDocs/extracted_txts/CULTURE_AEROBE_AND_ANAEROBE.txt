Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for processing and analyzing aerobic and
anaerobic specimens in order to isolate and identify bacteria present,
and to determine their antibiotic susceptibility profile, if applicable.
Responsibility:
All designated laboratory personnel are responsible for following this
procedure accurately to ensure the integrity of test results.
1. DEFINITION
Aerobic culture: A culture in which the specimen is incubated in the
presence of oxygen to promote the growth of aerobic bacteria.
Anaerobic culture: A culture in which the specimen is incubated in the
absence of oxygen to promote the growth of anaerobic bacteria.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies
1. Biological safety cabinet (BSC)
2. Incubators (35°C ambient air, 35°C anaerobic conditions)
3. Anaerobic jars or bags with appropriate gas-generating sachets
4. Blood agar plates (BAP)
5. MacConkey agar plates (MAC)
6. Chocolate agar plates (CHOC)
7. Anaerobic blood agar plates (CDC or BRU)
8. Thioglycollate broth (THIO)
9. Gram stain reagents
10. Catalase reagent (3% H2O2)
11. Oxidase reagent (N,N,N’,N’-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine
dihydrochloride)
12. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) materials
13. Sterile inoculation loops and swabs
14. Quality control strains for media and reagents
B. Sample Handling
1. Upon receipt, verify specimen label and requisition information.
2. Store specimen appropriately if processing is delayed (e.g.,
refrigerate if not processed within 2 hours, except where
anaerobic integrity must be preserved).
3. Perform a macroscopic examination of the specimen and
record observations.
4. Use aseptic techniques throughout the procedure. Work within
a BSC when handling potentially infectious materials.
C. Inoculation of Media
1. Aerobic Culture: a. Use a sterile loop to streak the BAP, MAC,
and CHOC plates for isolation. b. Inoculate THIO broth with the
specimen using a sterile swab. c. Incubate plates in an ambient
air incubator at 35°C for 24-48 hours. Incubate THIO broth
under the same conditions.
2. Anaerobic Culture: a. Use a sterile loop to streak the CDC or
BRU plate for isolation. b. Place the CDC or BRU plate into an
anaerobic jar or bag system. c. Inoculate an anaerobic THIO
broth with the specimen using a sterile swab. d. Incubate plates
and broth in an appropriate anaerobic environment at 35°C for
48-72 hours.
D. Examination and Reporting
1. Aerobic Culture: a. Examine plates after 24 hours. Re-incubate
if necessary. b. Perform Gram stain on colonies with different
morphologies. c. Perform preliminary tests such as catalase
and oxidase, and record observations. d. Subculture or perform
additional identification methods based on initial results. e.
Perform AST as required according to CLSI guidelines. f.
Record and report preliminary and final results.
2. Anaerobic Culture: a. Examine plates at 48 hours and re-
incubate if necessary. b. Perform Gram stain on colonies with
different morphologies. c. Specific identification tests may
include the use of gas-liquid chromatography, biochemical
tests, or MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. d. Perform AST if
necessary using appropriate media and conditions. e. Record
and report preliminary and final results.
E. Quality Control
1. Regularly monitor the performance of all media with appropriate
quality control strains.
2. Verify the functioning of incubators and anaerobic conditions
daily.
3. Ensure that Gram stain, catalase, and oxidase reagents are
tested against appropriate controls before each use.
F. Troubleshooting and Corrective Actions
1. If no growth appears on any plate, examine specimen integrity
and consider re-inoculation or additional incubation time.
2. If anticipated growth is not detected under anaerobic
conditions, review anaerobic system setup and gas-generating
sachets.
3. Document all deviations and corrective actions in the QC log.
G. Documentation
1. Maintain all results, observations, and corrective action records
according to the laboratory's documentation policies.
2. Ensure results entered into the LIS are accurate and verified by
a qualified technologist before release.
