Protocol for Generating Results for Culture for Genetic Testing,
Amniotic Fluid
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the analytical phase of
generating results from cultured amniotic fluid specimens for genetic
testing. The goal is to ensure accurate and timely results by following
strict guidelines for processing these specimens.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for
performing the procedures outlined in this protocol. Laboratory
supervisors are responsible for ensuring adherence to the protocol
and addressing any issues that may arise.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND PREPARATION
Specimen Collection:
• Amniotic fluid should be collected by a trained healthcare
professional using sterile techniques.
• The specimen should be placed in a sterile container and
promptly transported to the laboratory under appropriate
conditions to maintain its integrity.
Acceptable Specimen Types:
• Fresh amniotic fluid (typically 10-20 mL)
• Specimens maintained at 4°C during transport
• Specimens without contamination
Unacceptable Specimen Types:
• Specimens received more than 24 hours post-collection without
proper storage conditions
• Specimens contaminated during collection or transport
• Specimens with insufficient volume for testing
Specimen Handling:
• Upon receipt, inspect the specimen for proper labeling and
volume.
• Log the sample into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
Preparation for Cell Culture:
1. Transfer amniotic fluid into a sterile centrifuge tube.
2. Centrifuge at 1,000 rpm for 10 minutes to obtain a cell pellet.
3. Remove supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in culture
medium.
4. Incubate at 37°C with 5% CO2 in a tissue culture incubator.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Tissue culture incubator
• Laminar flow hood
• Centrifuge
• Microscope
Reagents:
• Sterile culture media (e.g., AmnioMAX®)
• Antibiotics to prevent contamination (optional)
Supplies:
• Sterile centrifuge tubes
• Pipettes and sterile pipette tips
• Cell culture plates/flasks
1. PROCEDURE
A) Initiating Cell Culture:
1. Under sterile conditions, add the appropriate volume of culture
medium to resuspended cell pellet.
2. Plate the cells into a culture flask or multi-well plate.
3. Place the culture vessel into the incubator and monitor daily for
cell growth and contamination.
B) Monitoring and Culturing Cells:
1. Over the next 7 to 10 days, monitor the culture daily under a
microscope to ensure proper growth and to detect any signs of
contamination.
2. If needed, change the culture medium every 2-3 days to
replenish nutrients and remove waste products.
C) Harvesting Cells for Genetic Testing:
1. Once sufficient cell growth is achieved (typically 7-10 days),
discard the old medium and add fresh medium.
2. Add trypsin-EDTA solution to detach adherent cells.
3. Collect cells by centrifugation at 1,000 rpm for 10 minutes.
4. Resuspend the cell pellet in a suitable buffer or culture medium
for further genetic analysis.
5. Prepare and store cell samples according to the requirements
of the genetic test to be performed.
6. QUALITY CONTROL AND VALIDATION
Monitoring Cell Cultures:
• Ensure daily microscopic examinations to assess cell viability and
absence of contamination.
• Document daily observations and any changes in culture
conditions in a culture logbook.
Validation:
• Prior to initiating genetic testing, verify cell counts and viability
using a hemocytometer and trypan blue exclusion assay.
• Perform genetic testing using standardized protocols validated for
accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
Data Entry:
• Enter all relevant data and observations into the LIS.
• Prepare a detailed report including genetic test results and
interpretative comments.
Verification:
• Review and validate results by comparing against control samples
and peer-reviewed references.
• Ensure all critical values and findings are corroborated by
additional tests or expert review.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING AND CORRECTIVE ACTION
Culture Issues:
• If contamination is observed, discard the affected culture and
initiate a new culture from reserve aliquots of the original
specimen.
• Troubleshoot issues related to cell growth by confirming
appropriate culture conditions (temperature, medium components,
CO2 concentration).
Reporting Errors:
• Investigate discrepancies in genetic test results, perform repeat
tests if necessary.
• Document issues and resolutions in the quality assurance log.

1. TERMINATION OF PROTOCOL
This protocol will be reviewed and updated periodically to incorporate
new best practices and technological advancements in genetic
testing. Any changes will be documented and communicated to all
involved personnel.
Note: This SOP is intended for use by trained laboratory personnel
and assumes proficiency in cell culture and genetic testing
techniques.
