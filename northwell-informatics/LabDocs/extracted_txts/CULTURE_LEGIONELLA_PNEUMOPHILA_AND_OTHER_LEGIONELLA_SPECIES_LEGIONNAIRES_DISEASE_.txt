Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Analytical Phase for Culture,
Legionella pneumophila, and Other Legionella Species (Legionnaires’
Disease)
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this SOP is to standardize the
analytical procedures for culturing and identifying Legionella
pneumophila and other Legionella species in clinical
specimens. This ensures accurate, timely, and reproducible
results, contributing to effective diagnosis and treatment of
Legionnaires' Disease.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for
performing, documenting, and validating the analytical procedures as
per this SOP. It is the responsibility of all staff to ensure the
maintenance and calibration of equipment and to report any
discrepancies or issues to the supervisory team.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen Types:
• Sputum
• Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL)
• Tracheal aspirates
• Lung tissue
• Pleural fluid
Specimen Handling:
• Specimens must be processed within 24 hours of collection. If
delayed, store at 2-8°C.
• Specimens collected in sterile containers should be handled
under biosafety protocols to prevent contamination and exposure
risks.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Equipment and Supplies:
• Buffered charcoal yeast extract (BCYE) agar
• Selective media (e.g., MWY agar)
• Sterile inoculation loops
• Incubators with appropriate temperature settings (35-37°C)
• Microscopy supplies including Gram stain reagents
• Legionella-specific latex agglutination test kits
• Autoclave for sterilization of equipment
B. Step-by-Step Procedure:
1. Sample Preparation: a. Homogenize sputum or BAL
specimens. b. Inoculate specimen onto BCYE and selective
media using a sterile loop. c. Streak plates for isolation to
ensure individual colonies.
2. Incubation: a. Incubate inoculated plates at 35-37°C in a
humidified incubator. b. Monitor cultures daily for up to 10 days
due to the slow-growing nature of Legionella species.
3. Identification: a. Inspect plates for characteristic Legionella
colonies (e.g., ground-glass appearance). b. Perform Gram
staining: Legionella typically appear as faintly staining, thin,
gram-negative bacilli. c. Confirm identification using Legionella-
specific latex agglutination test kits.
4. Quality Control: a. Include positive and negative controls in
each batch of cultures. b. Regularly verify the performance of
media, reagents, and test kits. c. Document all findings and
ensure accurate record-keeping reviewed by supervisory
personnel.
C. Troubleshooting: a. Re-incubate plates if growth is not observed
within the specified timeframe. b. Ensure that the inoculation and
incubation conditions are optimal for growth. c. If contamination is
suspected, re-inoculate and consider autoclaving equipment to
ensure sterility.
1. RESULT REPORTING
A. Interpretation:
• Positive culture for Legionella pneumophila or other Legionella
species is confirmed through colony morphology, Gram stain, and
latex agglutination.
• Negative results should be clearly documented after sufficient
incubation period without growth.
B. Documentation:
• Record results in the laboratory information system (LIS).
• Include colony morphology, staining characteristics, and
confirmation tests in reports.
• All findings must be verified by a qualified technologist before
transmitting to the physician.
C. Critical Results:
• Positive identification of Legionella species should be immediately
communicated to the physician as per established reporting
protocols.
