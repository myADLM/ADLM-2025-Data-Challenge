Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Culture, Neisseria
gonorrhoeae Only
1. PURPOSE
To ensure accurate and reliable results for the detection and
identification of Neisseria gonorrhoeae from clinical specimens
submitted for culture analysis.
Responsibility:
All laboratory staff involved in the process of culturing, identifying,
and reporting Neisseria gonorrhoeae are responsible for following
this procedure. It is the responsibility of the laboratory supervisor to
ensure that all staff are adequately trained and competent in this
procedure and to address any issues that may arise during the
process.
1. PRINCIPLE
Culturing for Neisseria gonorrhoeae involves inoculating the provided
specimen on selective media, incubating under appropriate
conditions to allow for bacterial growth, and identifying the organism
based on its biochemical properties.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred Specimen:
Endocervical or urethral swab for adults. Rectal, pharyngeal, or
conjunctival swab if indicated. Swabs must be placed in transport
media such as Amies with charcoal to maintain organism viability.
Unacceptable Specimen:
Specimens not appropriately labeled with patient identification and
collection date/time. Dry swabs or specimens not received in
transport media.
1. MATERIALS AND REAGENTS
Culture media: Modified Thayer-Martin (MTM) agar Martin-Lewis agar
GC-Lect agar Incubators set to 35-37°C with 5-7% CO2 atmosphere.
Oxidase reagent Bacticinerator or any other suitable loop sterilizer
1. PROCEDURE
A) Initial Inoculation:
1. Label the appropriate selective agar plate with patient identifier,
date, and specimen source.
2. Using a sterile inoculating loop or swab, inoculate the selective
media with the specimen.
3. Streak for isolation to obtain single colonies using standard
microbiological techniques.
B) Incubation:
1. Place the inoculated agar plates in a CO2 incubator or use a
CO2-generating system if an appropriate incubator is
unavailable.
2. Incubate the plates at 35-37°C for 24-48 hours.
C) Examination of Culture:
1. After 24-48 hours of incubation, examine the plates for the
presence of colonies that are characteristic of Neisseria
gonorrhoeae (small, grayish, translucent colonies).
2. Perform a Gram stain on suspicious colonies to confirm the
presence of Gram-negative diplococci.
D) Identification:
1. Perform an Oxidase Test: a. Apply a drop of oxidase reagent to
a piece of filter paper. b. Using a sterile wooden stick or loop,
touch a colony and smear it onto the oxidase reagent drop. c. A
positive oxidase reaction will turn the reagent blue/purple within
10-30 seconds.
2. Confirmatory testing such as carbohydrate utilization tests or
molecular methods should be performed as indicated.
3. Refer to detailed biochemical identification protocols if required.
4. REPORTING RESULTS
Positive Culture:
1. Report as "Neisseria gonorrhoeae isolated."
Negative Culture:
1. Report as "Neisseria gonorrhoeae not isolated."
If identification is inconclusive, notify the supervisor for further testing
or to send the specimen to a reference laboratory for confirmation.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
2. Use control strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae (ATCC 49226)
and non-pathogenic Neisseria species or other relevant
organisms on each batch of media prepared.
3. Incubate and examine control plates to ensure media
performance.
4. LIMITATIONS
5. The identification of Neisseria gonorrhoeae can be complicated
by the presence of other Neisseria species or Gram-negative
diplococci.
6. Proper specimen collection, transport, and timely processing
are critical for reliable results.
7. False-negative results may occur due to inadequate specimen
collection or antibiotic therapy.
