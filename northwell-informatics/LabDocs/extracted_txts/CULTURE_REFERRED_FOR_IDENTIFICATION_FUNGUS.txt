Standard Operating Procedure
1. PURPOSE
This SOP provides detailed instructions for the identification of fungi
from culture specimens within the laboratory. The procedure outlines
the processes for handling, analyzing, and identifying fungi to ensure
accuracy and reliability of test results.
2. SPECIMEN TYPES
Specimens that may be cultured for fungi include, but are not limited
to:
• Sputum
• Bronchial washes
• Tissues
• Body fluids (e.g., pleural, peritoneal)
• Urine
• Skin and nail scrapings
• Hair
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the designated microbiology laboratory staff
to correctly perform and document each step in the identification
process following the procedures outlined below. Any issues
encountered during the procedure should be reported immediately to
a supervisor.
4. PROCEDURE
4.1 Specimen Reception and Accessioning
Specimens should be received from the clinical area, properly
labeled and accompanied by an appropriate requisition form.
1. Match the specimen label with the requisition form details.
2. Accession the specimen into the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
3. Log the receipt of the specimen and assign a unique
identification number.
4.2 Culture and Incubation
1. Upon receipt, process the specimen for fungal culture: a. Use
aseptic technique to inoculate the specimen onto fungal culture
media (e.g., Sabouraud Dextrose Agar (SDA), Mycosel Agar).
b. For dermatophytes or superficial fungi, include a
dermatophyte test medium (DTM).
2. Incubate the culture plates: a. SDA plates at 30°C for up to 4
weeks. b. Mycosel Agar and DTM plates at 25°C for up to 4
weeks.
3. Monitor the culture plates twice weekly for growth and colony
characteristics.
4.3 Microscopic Examination
1. Perform direct microscopic examination by preparing slides
from the primary culture growth: a. Use Lactophenol Cotton
Blue (LPCB) stain for detailed fungal morphology. b. Use KOH
(10-20%) for clearing cellular debris if needed.
2. Examine the stained preparations under a microscope,
document the observed structures (hyphae, conidia, spores,
etc.).
4.4 Sub-culturing and Purification
1. If mixed colonies are present, subculture onto fresh plates to
isolate pure fungal cultures.
2. Repeat incubation and monitor till pure cultures are obtained.
4.5 Identification
Based on Macroscopic and Microscopic Features:
1. Macroscopic Examination: a. Record colony morphology
including color, texture, and topography.
2. Microscopic Examination: a. Describe the hyphae (septate/
aseptate), conidia (shape, arrangement), and reproductive
structures.
3. Perform the following tests as required: a. Urea test to identify
urease-positive species. b. Carbohydrate assimilation tests for
yeast identification. c. Temperature tolerance tests.
Advanced Identification:
1. For complex cases where conventional methods are
insufficient, perform molecular diagnostic techniques: a. PCR
amplification and sequencing of fungal DNA. b. MALDI-TOF
mass spectrometry for protein profile-based identification.
4.6 Quality Control
1. Include known control organisms in each batch of culturing,
staining, and testing.
2. Record control results in the QC log.
3. Review QC results daily and document any deviations with
corrective actions taken.
5. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Document preliminary findings promptly in the LIS.
2. Upon final identification, complete the full laboratory report
including: a. Specimen type, culture conditions, and
identification conclusion. b. Any additional testing results and
interpretations.
3. Ensure the report is reviewed and verified by a qualified
microbiologist before release.
4. Communicate critical findings immediately to the ordering
physician and document the communication in the LIS.
