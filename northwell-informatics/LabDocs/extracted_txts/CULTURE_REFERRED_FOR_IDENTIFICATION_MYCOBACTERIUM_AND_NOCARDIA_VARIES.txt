Standard Operating Procedure
CULTURE REFERRED FOR IDENTIFICATION,
MYCOBACTERIUM AND NOCARDIA, VARIES
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized protocol for the identification of
Mycobacterium and Nocardia species from clinical specimens using
specific methodologies after the specimens have been collected,
received, and accessioned.
2. DEFINITIONS
Mycobacterium: A genus of Actinobacteria characterized by complex
cell walls and slow growth.
Nocardia: A genus of bacteria known to cause opportunistic infections
in humans.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the laboratory technologist to ensure proper
handling and processing of the culture, as well as accurate
identification of Mycobacterium and Nocardia species.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimens should be processed promptly after receipt and
accessioned. Delays in processing should be minimized to ensure
the integrity and optimal recovery of the microorganisms.
Acceptable specimens:
• Respiratory specimens (sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage, tracheal
aspirate)
• Tissue biopsy
• Body fluids (pleural fluid, cerebrospinal fluid, etc.)
• Swabs (wound, skin lesions)
Specimens should be maintained at 2-8°C if storage is necessary
before processing.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Biosafety cabinet Class II
• Lowenstein-Jensen (LJ) slant tubes
• Middlebrook 7H10 or 7H11 agar plates
• Sheep blood agar plates
• Sabouraud agar plates for contaminant overgrowth control
• Ziehl-Neelsen staining kit
• Auramine-rhodamine staining kit
• Mycobacterium identification kits (e.g., MGIT, GeneXpert MTB/
RIF)
• Nocardia identification kits (e.g., Kinyoun stain, molecular
identification tools)
6. PROCEDURE
A) Processing of Specimens
1. Safety Considerations:
◦ Perform all specimen handling procedures in a Class II
Biosafety Cabinet.
◦ Wear gloves, lab coat, and appropriate PPE.
◦ Decontaminate biological waste according to biohazard
protocols.
2. Direct Smear Preparation:
◦ Prepare a direct smear for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) staining
using the Ziehl-Neelsen or Auramine-rhodamine technique.
◦ Air dry the smear and fix with heat.
◦ Stain and examine under a microscope. Document the
presence and morphology of acid-fast organisms.
3. Culture Inoculation:
◦ Decontaminate specimens, if necessary, using a standard
N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NALC) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH)
method.
◦ Following decontamination, centrifuge the specimen at
3000g for 15 minutes.
◦ Resuspend the pellet in sterile phosphate buffer (pH 6.8) to
prepare a concentrated specimen.
4. Inoculation and Incubation:
◦ Inoculate 0.2 mL of the concentrated specimen onto LJ
slants, Middlebrook 7H10 or 7H11 agar, and sheep blood
agar plates.
◦ Incubate LJ and Middlebrook agar tubes at 35-37°C in an
atmosphere of 5-10% CO2.
◦ Incubate sheep blood agar plates at 35-37°C under aerobic
conditions.
5. Examine Cultures:
◦ Monitor and check cultures daily for the first week and then
twice weekly.
◦ Record growth characteristics, including colony morphology,
pigmentation, and rate of growth.
B) Identification
1. Acid-Fast Stain:
◦ Perform AFB staining on growth observed from LJ slants
and Middlebrook agar.
◦ Examine under a microscope to confirm the presence of
acid-fast bacilli.
2. Biochemical and Molecular Identification:
◦ Use biochemical assays such as niacin production, nitrate
reduction test, catalase test at 68°C for Mycobacterium spp.
◦ Perform molecular assays like PCR, GeneXpert MTB/RIF, or
line probe assays as necessary for species-level
identification.
3. Nocardia Identification:
◦ Perform Kinyoun stain or modified acid-fast staining to
confirm Nocardia presence.
◦ Conduct molecular identification methods, such as 16S
rRNA sequencing, to determine the species.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Ensure all culture media are quality control tested with reference
strains (e.g., Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv, Nocardia
asteroides).
• Include positive and negative controls in all staining procedures.
• Validate new lots of reagents and media as per existing laboratory
protocols.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Report preliminary results based on the direct smear findings.
• Final results, including identification and susceptibility profiles,
must be reviewed and verified by the attending microbiologist or
technologist.
• Document identification and reporting in the Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
9. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
• Positive ID for Mycobacterium tuberculosis or other
Mycobacterium spp. should be communicated urgently following
laboratory protocols.
• Identification of Nocardia spp. should be documented with
appropriate clinical significance notes based on the species
identified.
10. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Contaminations are common and should be minimized through
proper specimen processing.
• Ensure proper differentiation between Mycobacterium, Nocardia,
and contaminants.
