Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
CULTURE REFERRED FOR IDENTIFICATION, MYCOBACTERIUM
AND NOCARDIA WITH ANTIMICROBIAL SUSCEPTIBILITY
TESTING
1. PRINCIPLE AND PURPOSE
This protocol outlines the steps involved in the analytical phase for
identifying cultures referred for Mycobacterium and Nocardia, and for
performing antimicrobial susceptibility testing. This procedure
ensures accurate identification and susceptibility results, which are
critical for appropriate clinical management.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Types:
• Sputum
• Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL)
• Tissue biopsies
• Sterile body fluids (e.g., cerebrospinal fluid)
Specimen Stability:
• Specimens must be transported to the laboratory fresh and
should be processed immediately.
• Specimens should be maintained at 2-8°C if processing cannot be
done within 2 hours.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens received in non-sterile containers.
• Specimens received with significant leakage or contamination.
• Insufficient specimen volume.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Biosafety cabinet
• Incubator (specified at 35-37°C)
• Middlebrook 7H9 broth
• Lowenstein-Jensen slants
• Antibiotic susceptibility testing media (commercially prepared)
• Identification kits/automated identification systems/software
• Microscope for acid-fast bacteria (AFB) staining
• Antimicrobial susceptibility testing equipment (e.g., Microplate
reader, VITEK 2)
• Disposable inoculating loops and needles
• Sterile pipettes and transfer devices
1. PROCEDURE
A) Initial Culture Setup:
1. Upon receipt, accession the specimen according to laboratory
protocols for tracking.
2. Perform AFB staining to visualize potential Mycobacterium or
Nocardia presence.
• Prepare smear and fix on slide.
• Stain using Ziehl-Neelsen or Kinyoun method.
• Examine under oil immersion (1000x magnification) for detection
of AFB.
1. Inoculate specimen onto selective media and broth:
• Solid media: Inoculate Lowenstein-Jensen slants.
• Liquid media: Inoculate Middlebrook 7H9 broth.
1. Incubate cultures at 35-37°C.
B) Monitoring and Subculturing:
1. Monitor cultures daily for visible growth for up to 6 weeks.
2. Subculture from broth and slant media to identify isolates.
C) Identification:
1. Perform biochemical tests or use automated identification
systems to identify isolates.
◦ Use appropriate identification kits or systems, following
manufacturer's protocols.
◦ Document identification results.
2. Confirm identification with molecular methods if necessary
(e.g., PCR, sequencing).
D) Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing:
1. Select pure cultures for susceptibility testing.
2. Inoculate standardized antibiotic susceptibility media.
◦ Follow Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI)
guidelines for inoculum preparation.
3. Test a panel of appropriate antimicrobials relevant to
Mycobacterium or Nocardia.
◦ Perform testing using automated systems or manual
methods.
4. Incubate and monitor results according to CLSI standards.
E) Interpretation and Reporting of Results:
1. Interpret growth and susceptibility patterns using CLSI
breakpoints.
2. Document results and review for clinical significance.
3. Report findings according to laboratory protocol:
◦ Include organism identification, susceptibilities, including
resistance profiles.
◦ Flag critical results according to laboratory standards.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform regular calibration and maintenance of identification and
susceptibility testing equipment.
• Run quality control strains and reagents to validate each batch of
susceptibility tests.
• Document and address any deviations or discrepancies promptly.
1. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS
• Follow biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) protocols when handling
Mycobacterium and Nocardia.
• Use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), including
lab coats, gloves, and face masks.
• Ensure proper disposal of biohazardous waste.
