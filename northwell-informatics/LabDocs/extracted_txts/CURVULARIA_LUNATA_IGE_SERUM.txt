Analytical Phase Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) for
CURVULARIA LUNATA, IGE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedure for the
measurement and reporting of Curvularia lunata-specific
Immunoglobulin E (IgE) in serum samples. This measurement is
performed to determine the specific IgE levels associated with
hypersensitivity to Curvularia lunata, a fungus commonly found in
soil.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the laboratory staff to perform and document
Curvularia lunata IgE testing according to this SOP. All results must
be analyzed, reviewed, and reported accurately to ensure the
reliability of patient test results.
3. DEFINITION
Curvularia lunata-specific IgE: Specific antibodies produced by the
immune system when exposed to Curvularia lunata, indicating an
allergic response to this particular fungus.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Automated Immunoassay Analyzer (e.g., ImmunoCAP,
IMMULITE, etc.)
• Curvularia lunata-specific IgE test kit (acquired from
manufacturers like Thermo Fisher Scientific, Siemens, etc.)
• Calibrators and controls specific to the test kit
• Serum samples
• Pipettes and tips
• Vortex mixer
• Barcode labels for sample identification
• Reaction cuvettes or cartridges
• Storage containers (for reagents and serum)
5. PROCEDURE
5.1 Sample Preparation:
1. Specimen Requirements:
◦ The preferred specimen is serum collected in plain tubes
(red-top or SST tubes).
◦ Ensure the sample is free from hemolysis, lipemia, or any
contaminants.
◦ Samples should be transported and processed promptly and
kept at refrigerated temperature (2-8°C) if delays exceed
two hours.
2. Sample Processing:
◦ Centrifuge the blood sample at 3,000 RPM for 10 minutes to
obtain serum.
◦ Aliquot the serum into appropriately labeled secondary
tubes.
◦ Store aliquots at 2-8°C if not processed immediately, and
avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
5.2 Assay Procedure:
1. Preparation:
◦ Power on the immunoassay analyzer and ensure it is
calibrated and in working condition.
◦ Load the specific Curvularia lunata IgE test kit into the
analyzer according to manufacturer instructions.
◦ Run instrument calibrators and Quality Control (QC)
samples to verify the system performance before running
patient samples. Document the QC results.
2. Test Execution:
◦ For each patient sample:
▪ Scan the barcode label of the patient sample.
▪ Pipette the required volume of serum (as specified by
the kit instructions, typically 50-100 µL) into the reaction
well.
▪ Insert the reaction cuvettes or cartridges into the
analyzer.
▪ Start the assay run according to the automated
equipment protocol.
3. Detection and Measurement:
◦ The immunoassay analyzer measures the quantity of
Curvularia lunata-specific IgE in the serum based on the
binding of IgE to allergen-coated particles, followed by a
subsequent detection system (chemiluminescence,
fluorescence, etc.).
◦ The analyzer calculates the IgE concentration and displays
the result.
5.3 Calibration and Quality Control:
1. Calibration:
◦ Perform calibration according to the manufacturer’s
instructions using the provided calibrators.
◦ Record calibration data, ensuring the accuracy of the
analyzer before testing patient samples.
2. Quality Control:
◦ Analyze QC samples alongside patient samples to ensure
the analytical system is functioning correctly.
◦ Accept the QC results only if they fall within the
manufacturer-specified range. Document all QC results and
actions taken on any discrepancy.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Review and Verification:
◦ Review all results for accuracy and completeness.
◦ Verify any flagged results or outliers following the quality
control procedures.
2. Reference Intervals:
◦ Normal IgE concentration: <0.1 kU/L (refer to site-specific or
manufacturer-recommended reference ranges).
◦ Report any IgE concentration above the reference interval
as abnormal and possible indication of hypersensitivity.
3. Documentation:
◦ Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
◦ Cross-check the input data to match patient identifiers
accurately.
◦ Results must be reviewed and confirmed by the supervising
technologist prior to validation in the LIS.
◦ Critical values should be reported to the attending physician
immediately. Ensure documentation of all critical
communication.
4. Result Interpretation:
◦ Interpret the Curvularia lunata-specific IgE concentration in
the context of clinical findings, patient history, and other
diagnostic procedures.
7. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• High levels of non-specific binding or cross-reactivity with other
allergens may affect IgE quantification.
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples can interfere with assay
results.
• Follow the manufacturer’s product insert for any additional
method limitations.
