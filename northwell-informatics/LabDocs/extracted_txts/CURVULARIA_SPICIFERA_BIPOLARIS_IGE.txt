Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for CURVULARIA SPICIFERA/
BIPOLARIS IGE Testing
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the analytical procedures for
detecting and quantifying specific Immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies
against Curvularia spicifera/Bipolaris allergens in patient samples.
Proper adherence to these procedures ensures the accuracy and
reliability of laboratory test results for diagnosing potential allergic
reactions.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of qualified laboratory personnel to perform the
Curvularia spicifera/Bipolaris IgE test accurately following the SOP
guidelines. Personnel must be properly trained in handling reagents,
equipment, and patient samples.
1. DEFINITIONS
Curvularia spicifera/Bipolaris IgE: Specific IgE antibodies targeted
towards Curvularia spicifera or Bipolaris allergens, indicating an
allergic reaction.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
4.1 Equipment:
• Immunoassay analyzer (e.g., ELISA reader)
• Centrifuge
• Refrigerator (2-8°C)
4.2 Reagents:
• Curvularia spicifera/Bipolaris IgE assay kit
• Quality control material (negative and positive controls)
• Calibration standards
4.3 Supplies:
• Assay microplates
• Pipettes and tips
• Tubes for sample collection
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
• Record-keeping logs
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Preferred specimen: Serum or plasma collected in SST (serum
separator tube) or heparinized vacutainer. Unacceptable specimens:
Hemolyzed, lipemic, or microbial-contaminated specimens.
Specimen handling: Store specimens at 2-8°C if the analysis is
delayed. Ensure the specimens are fully filled and free from bubbles
and clots.
1. PROCEDURE
6.1 Sample Preparation:
• Verify the specimens for acceptance criteria (volume, labeling,
and integrity).
• Centrifuge the sample at 1500-2000 rpm for 10 minutes to
separate serum/plasma if not already done.
• Ensure clear, non-hemolyzed, non-lipemic specimens.
6.2 Preparation of Reagents and Equipment:
• Bring all reagents, controls, and samples to room temperature
before use.
• Prepare the microplates with specified wells for patient samples,
positive controls, negative controls, and calibration standards
according to the assay kit instructions.
6.3 Analytical Testing Procedure:
1. Setup the assay microplate according to the Curvularia
spicifera/Bipolaris IgE assay kit instructions.
2. Pipette 100 µL of patient samples, controls, and calibration
standards into respective wells.
3. Add the enzyme-linked conjugate reagent to each well.
4. Incubate and wash as per the assay kit's detailed protocol.
5. Add the substrate solution to each well and incubate for the
recommended duration.
6. Stop the enzymatic reaction by adding the stop solution
provided in the kit.
7. Read the optical density (OD) of each well using an
immunoassay analyzer/plate reader at the specified wavelength
(typically 450 nm).
8. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run positive and negative controls with each batch to monitor
assay performance.
• Evaluate the calibration curve and ensure all standards fall within
the expected ranges.
• Document all control results, and repeat the analysis if control
values fall outside the set limits.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Calculate the concentration of Curvularia spicifera/Bipolaris IgE in
patient samples using the calibration curve.
• Review the results for any aberrations or unexpected values.
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS),
ensuring verification by qualified laboratory personnel.
• Report critical values immediately to the requesting physician and
document appropriately.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• IgE levels < 0.35 kU/L: Negative (no allergic sensitization to
Curvularia spicifera/Bipolaris)
• IgE levels ≥ 0.35 kU/L: Positive (presence of allergic sensitization
to Curvularia spicifera/Bipolaris)
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the assay kit insert for limitations related to specificity,
sensitivity, and interference.
1. SAFETY PRECAUTIONS
• Utilize PPE, such as gloves, lab coats, and goggles, throughout
the testing procedure.
• Practice all standard laboratory safety guidelines to minimize risk
exposure. 8.7 Disposal: Dispose of biological waste and assay-
related materials according to biomedical waste guidelines.
