STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP) CUSTOM GENE
PANEL, HEREDITARY, NEXT-GENERATION SEQUENCING (NGS)
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the analytical phase of
generating results for Custom Gene Panel, Hereditary, using Next-
Generation Sequencing (NGS) technology. This includes sample
preparation, library preparation, sequencing, data analysis, and result
reporting procedures.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for
adhering to this protocol, ensuring the proper handling, processing,
and analysis of samples. Supervisors are responsible for monitoring
compliance and addressing any issues that arise during the analytical
phase.
1. DEFINITIONS
Custom Gene Panel, Hereditary: NGS-based testing that targets
specific sets of genes known to be associated with hereditary
conditions. Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS): High-throughput
sequencing technology that allows for rapid sequencing of large
segments of DNA.
1. PROCEDURE
3.1 Sample Preparation
• Ensure specimens are received and accessioned according to
laboratory protocols. • Confirm that samples meet the quality and
quantity requirements for NGS testing. • Extract DNA from the
biological specimens using validated extraction methods. • Quantify
and assess the quality of the extracted DNA using spectrophotometry
(e.g., NanoDrop) and fluorometry (e.g., Qubit) and electrophoresis
(e.g., TapeStation).
3.2 Library Preparation
• Prepare DNA libraries using a validated library preparation kit
specific to the Custom Gene Panel. • Fragment the DNA to the
appropriate size if required by the library preparation protocol. •
Perform end-repair, adapter ligation, and amplification steps as per
the kit instructions. • Purify the libraries using magnetic beads or
suitable purification methods to remove unwanted fragments and
reagents. • Quantify the final libraries and assess their quality using
appropriate methods (e.g., Qubit, TapeStation, or Bioanalyzer).
3.3 Sequencing
• Load prepared libraries onto the NGS platform according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. • Set up sequencing run using the NGS
instrument software and input the required parameters and sample
information. • Monitor the sequencing run for successful initiation and
progress, troubleshooting any issues as per the instrument’s
guidelines. • Upon completion, ensure proper storage of raw
sequencing data and maintain chain-of-custody documentation for
samples and data.
3.4 Data Analysis
• Transfer raw sequencing data to the bioinformatics pipeline for data
processing. • Perform initial quality control checks to assess read
quality and quantity (e.g., using FastQC). • Map sequenced reads to
the reference genome using a suitable aligner (e.g., BWA, Bowtie). •
Identify variants using variant calling software (e.g., GATK,
FreeBayes). • Annotate identified variants using an appropriate
annotation tool (e.g., ANNOVAR, VEP). • Perform secondary quality
control to filter out low-quality and non-significant variants. • Ensure
data privacy and integrity through secure data storage and encryption
methods.
3.5 Interpretation and Reporting
• Review the annotated variant list and curate clinically relevant
variants specific to the hereditary condition being investigated. •
Cross-reference identified variants with established databases and
literature to determine their clinical significance. • Compile a clinical
report detailing the findings, including pathogenicity, evidence, and
any relevant recommendations. • Have a qualified clinical geneticist
or molecular pathologist review and sign off on the final report. •
Deliver the final report to the clinician or requester, ensuring
confidentiality and compliance with regulatory requirements.
1. QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE
• Run positive and negative controls with each batch to ensure the
accuracy and reliability of results. • Use internal quality control
samples to monitor each step of the process. • Document all
deviations from established protocols and implement corrective
actions. • Participate in external proficiency testing programs for
continuous assessment of performance. • Periodically review and
update SOPs, taking into account new advancements in technology
and best practices.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions for DNA extraction and library
preparation kits. • User manuals for NGS instruments and
bioinformatics software. • Relevant clinical guidelines and variant
databases (e.g., ClinVar, OMIM). • Laboratory internal policies and
quality manuals.
1. DOCUMENTATION
• Maintain detailed records of sample tracking, DNA quality, library
preparation, sequencing runs, and data analysis. • Log all quality
control measures and results. • Document all final reports and ensure
proper archival of sequencing data for future reference.
