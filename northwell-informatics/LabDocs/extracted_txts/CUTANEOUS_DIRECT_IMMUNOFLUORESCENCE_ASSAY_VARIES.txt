Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Cutaneous Direct
Immunofluorescence Assay (DIF)
1. PURPOSE
This document provides a detailed standard operating procedure for
performing cutaneous direct immunofluorescence assays (DIF) to
ensure accurate and reliable diagnostic results.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for adhering to this
procedure. It is the responsibility of all laboratory personnel to report
any issues or deviations to their supervisor.
1. DEFINITION
Direct Immunofluorescence (DIF) is a diagnostic technique used to
detect the presence of specific antibodies or antigens in tissue
sections. DIF involves labeling antibodies with fluorescent dyes to
visualize under a fluorescence microscope.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Fluorescence microscope
• Cryostat (for frozen sectioning)
• Humidified chamber
• Slides and coverslips
• Fluorescent-labeled antibodies (specific for IgG, IgA, IgM, C3, and
fibrinogen)
• Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)
• Mounting medium (with antifade reagent)
• Microtome or cryostat
• Control tissue slides
• Timer
• Pipettes and tips
• Incubation trays
• Gloves and lab coat
1. PROCEDURE
Specimen Preparation:
1. Receive biopsy specimens that have been appropriately tagged
and documented.
2. Depending on the laboratory’s protocol’s preference, ensure
tissue specimens are fresh-frozen and stored in optimum
cutting temperature (OCT) compound or formalin-fixed and
paraffin-embedded (FFPE).
Sectioning:
1. For fresh-frozen specimens, cut 6 µm -thick sections using a
cryostat. For FFPE specimens, cut 3-5 µm -thick sections using
a microtome.
2. Mount the tissue sections onto clean, labeled glass slides and
air dry for 10-15 minutes.
Fixation and Blocking:
1. Air-dry freshly cut tissue sections for 30 minutes at room
temperature.
2. Fix the slides in acetone for 10 minutes at 4°C and air-dry
again. Alternatively, fix FFPE slides in cold methanol and
acetone mixture (10 minutes each).
3. Wash sections briefly in PBS for 5 minutes and then gently blot
around the tissue to remove the excess PBS.
Staining:
1. Prepare incubation trays with wet absorbent material to create
a humidified environment.
2. Apply 50-100 µL of each primary antibody (IgG, IgA, IgM, C3,
and fibrinogen) to their respect sections. Ensure the antibody
solutions cover the tissue completely.
3. Incubate the slides in a dark, humidified chamber for 30
minutes at room temperature. Don protective goggles and work
under low-light conditions to avoid bleaching fluorescent labels.
4. Wash the slides three times in PBS, each wash for 5 minutes
with gentle agitation.
Mounting:
1. After the final wash, gently blot around the tissue again to
remove excess PBS. Avoid drying out the tissue section.
2. Add one drop of mounting medium onto the tissue section.
3. Carefully place a coverslip over the tissue, avoiding air bubbles.
Microscopic Examination:
1. Examine the stained slides under a fluorescence microscope
immediately after mounting.
2. Observe and document the specific fluorescent staining
patterns, evaluating the presence, intensity, and distribution of
IgG, IgA, IgM, C3, and fibrinogen.
Quality Control:
1. Run a positive and negative control with each batch of DIF tests
to ensure the validity of the staining and results.
2. Document the results of the controls in the laboratory logbook
to maintain accurate QC records.
3. REPORTING RESULTS
4. Record the results accurately in the laboratory information
system, noting the presence, intensity, and distribution of the
fluorescence staining.
5. Ensure all results are reviewed and verified by a qualified
personnel before reporting them to the referring physician.
Reference Intervals:
IgG: Negative IgA: Negative IgM: Negative C3: Negative Fibrinogen:
Negative
Method Limitations:
Refer to the manufacturer's insert of the fluorescent-labeled
antibodies for any specific limitations or potential interferences.
