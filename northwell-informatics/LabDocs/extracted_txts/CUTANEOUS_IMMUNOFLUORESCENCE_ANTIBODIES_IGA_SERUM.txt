Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase in
CUTANEOUS IMMUNOFLUORESCENCE ANTIBODIES, IGA,
SERUM
1. PURPOSE
This SOP describes the procedures for the accurate and consistent
analytical testing of cutaneous immunofluorescence antibodies (IgA)
in serum.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory personnel trained in immunofluorescence
testing are responsible for performing and documenting this
procedure.
1. DEFINITION
Cutaneous Immunofluorescence (CIF) is a laboratory method used to
detect the presence of antibodies (specifically IgA) against
components of the skin by using fluorescently-labeled antibodies.
1. PROCEDURE
Materials and Equipment:
• Fluorescence microscope
• IgA FITC-conjugated antisera
• Positive and Negative Control serum samples
• Serum samples
• Buffer solutions (PBS)
• Glass slides
• Coverslips
• Immersion oil
• Forceps
• Pipettes and tips
• Humidified chamber
Reagent Preparation:
• Ensure all reagents are at room temperature before use.
• Prepare PBS buffer as per manufacturer's instructions.
Slide Preparation:
• Clean and label glass slides.
• Place a tissue section on each slide using forceps.
• Fix in acetone for 10 minutes and air dry thoroughly.
Sample Application:
• Dilute serum samples 1:10 in PBS.
• Apply 10 µL of sample to the designated area of the slide.
• Place slides in a humidified chamber and incubate at room
temperature for 30 minutes.
Washing Step:
• Rinse slides in PBS buffer for 5 minutes (three separate washes).
• Blot gently around sections using lab wipes to remove excess
buffer.
Staining Procedure:
• Apply 10 µL of FITC-conjugated anti-IgA to each section.
• Incubate in the dark in a humidified chamber at room temperature
for 30 minutes.
Final Washing:
• Rinse in PBS for 5 minutes (three separate washes).
• Blot gently around sections to remove excess buffer.
Mounting:
• Apply a small drop of mounting medium (e.g., glycerol or
commercial mounting solution) to each slide.
• Carefully place a coverslip over the tissue section, avoiding air
bubbles.
Examination:
• Examine slides using a fluorescence microscope with appropriate
filters for FITC.
• Evaluate the presence and pattern of fluorescence corresponding
to IgA deposition.
1. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
Positive:
• Bright apple-green fluorescence indicating the presence of IgA
antibodies.
Negative:
• No detectable fluorescence or only non-specific background
staining.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run positive and negative control sera with each batch of patient
tests to ensure assay accuracy.
• Document control results in the relevant log.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Document results promptly after examination.
• Entries must include sample ID, testing date, technologist’s
initials, and findings.
• Follow site-specific reporting guidelines for data entry into the
laboratory information system (LIS).
Reference Intervals:
• Interpret in the context of individual patient profiles and clinical
histories.
Method Limitations:
• False negatives may occur if the tissues are damaged or
improperly prepared.
• Non-specific binding can yield false-positive results.
