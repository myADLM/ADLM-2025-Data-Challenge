Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Cutaneous Immunofluorescence Antibodies,
IgG, Serum
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the procedure for analyzing and generating results
for Cutaneous Immunofluorescence Antibodies, IgG, Serum. It
ensures consistent and accurate results to aid in the diagnosis of
autoimmune bullous diseases.
Responsibility:
• It is the responsibility of designated laboratory personnel to
perform the analytical procedures as defined here.
• Supervisors are responsible for training staff and ensuring
adherence to this SOP.
1. SPECIMEN
• Preferred: Serum obtained from a blood sample collected in a
red-top tube or a serum-separator tube (SST).
• Stability: Specimens should remain stable for up to 24 hours at
room temperature, 48 hours when refrigerated (2-8°C), and long-
term storage at -20°C or lower permitted if specimens are stored
for longer durations.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Microscope with appropriate immunofluorescence filter
• Centrifuge
• Serum separator tubes (SST) or plain red-top tubes
• Immunofluorescence Antibody (IFA) slides specific for cutaneous
IgG
• Conjugate reagent (Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled
anti-human IgG)
• Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4
• Cover slips
• Humidity chamber
• Slide rack
• Positive and negative control sera
1. PROCEDURE
2. Preparation of Samples: a. Centrifuge collected serum samples
at 1500-2000 g for 10 minutes to separate serum. b. Pipette the
serum into labeled aliquot tubes if necessary, avoiding
hemolysis and lipemia.
3. Preparation of Slides: a. Allow IFA slides to come to room
temperature. b. Apply 1-2 drops of patient serum to the
appropriate well on the IFA slide. c. Apply positive and negative
control sera to their respective wells.
4. Incubation: a. Place the slide in a humidity chamber. b.
Incubate the slide at room temperature for 30 minutes to allow
the serum antibodies to bind to the substrate.
5. Washing: a. Remove the slides from the humidity chamber and
immerse in PBS. b. Rinse well by gently agitating in PBS for 5
minutes; repeat if necessary.
6. Application of Conjugate: a. Apply 1-2 drops of FITC-labeled
anti-human IgG conjugate to each well. b. Return slides to the
humidity chamber and incubate for another 30 minutes at room
temperature.
7. Washing: a. Repeat the washing step as described in the
Washing section above.
8. Mounting the Slide: a. Rinse slides briefly in distilled water to
remove excess PBS. b. Air dry or blot dry gently. c. Apply a
cover slip using an appropriate mounting medium.
9. Examination: a. Examine the slides under a fluorescence
microscope using the proper filter set. b. Compare patient
samples to control samples. c. Assess fluorescence patterns
and intensity and document findings.
10. QUALITY CONTROL
• Quality control sera (positive and negative controls) must be
included in each batch of tests performed.
• Verify the performance of reagents and equipment daily.
• Document the use of controls and results, and any deviations or
issues must be reported to the supervisor.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results must be documented in the laboratory information system
(LIS) for review.
• A report must include the intensity and pattern of staining.
• Positive results should be confirmed by retesting or using a
separate test method.
• Results should be reviewed and verified by a qualified
technologist or supervisor.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Negative: No specific fluorescence or background fluorescence
only.
• Positive: Specific fluorescence at the dermoepidermal junction
(DEJ).
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or contaminated specimens may yield
inaccurate results.
• Results must be interpreted in conjunction with clinical findings
and other diagnostic tests.
