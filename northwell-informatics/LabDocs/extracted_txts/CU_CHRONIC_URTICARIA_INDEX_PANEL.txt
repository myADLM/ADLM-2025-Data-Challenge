Standard Operating Procedure: Analytical Phase of Generating
Results for Chronic Urticaria (CU) Index Panel
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the detailed procedures for the
analytical phase of generating results for the Chronic Urticaria (CU)
Index Panel. This includes the preparation, execution, quality control,
and documentation processes to ensure accurate and reliable
results.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of designated laboratory staff to perform the
analytical procedures as outlined in this SOP. All staff members must
adhere to these procedures to maintain the quality and integrity of the
test results.
1. DEFINITION
The CU Index Panel is a laboratory test designed to evaluate and
quantify the presence of autoantibodies and other biomarkers
associated with chronic urticaria.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Pre-Analytical Preparation
1. Ensure that the specimen has been properly collected,
received, and accessioned as per laboratory protocols.
2. Verify patient identification and test requisition details.
3. Centrifuge the specimen at 1,500 x g for 10 minutes to separate
serum/plasma. Transfer the serum/plasma to a clean, labeled
tube.
B. Reagents and Supplies
1. CU Index Panel Test Kit (including all necessary reagents and
controls)
2. Micropipettes and tips
3. Centrifuge
4. Incubator
5. Plate reader (capable of reading at the required wavelengths)
6. Personal protective equipment (PPE)
C. Analytical Process
1. Calibration and Controls:
◦ Prepare calibrators and controls as per the kit instructions.
◦ Include positive and negative controls in each run to ensure
accuracy and reliability.
2. Reagent Preparation:
◦ Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for reagent
preparation. Ensure all reagents are at the correct
temperature before use.
◦ Label all reagents and prepared solutions with dates of
preparation and expiry.
3. Assay Procedure:
◦ Bring all reagents and specimens to room temperature
before starting the assay.
◦ Add the appropriate volume of standards, controls, and
patient specimens to the designated wells in the assay
plate. Follow the kit’s protocol for incubation times and
temperatures.
◦ Perform all washing steps precisely as per the instructions
to avoid cross-contamination.
◦ Add the detection reagent and incubate for the time
specified in the kit's instructions.
◦ Read the plate at the appropriate wavelength using the plate
reader after the final incubation step.
4. Reading and Interpreting Results:
◦ Calculate the CU Index for each sample using the formula
provided by the kit manufacturer.
◦ Interpret the results according to the reference ranges
provided in the kit insert.
◦ Any critical ranges or abnormal results should be
immediately flagged and processed for verification.
D. Quality Control
1. Internal Quality Control:
◦ Run quality control samples with each batch of patient
samples.
◦ Document the results of all quality control samples. Any
deviations from the acceptable range must be investigated
and resolved before proceeding with patient samples.
2. External Quality Assurance:
◦ Participate in external quality assurance programs as
available to compare performance with other laboratories.
E. Documentation and Reporting
1. Record all raw data, observations, and any deviations from the
procedure in the laboratory’s logbook or LIS (Laboratory
Information System).
2. Review and verify results before releasing them to ensure they
meet quality standards.
3. Report results to the clinician through the LIS following site-
specific reporting protocols.
4. Method Limitations
Refer to the manufacturer’s instructions for assay-specific limitations,
such as potential interferences and cross-reactivity.
