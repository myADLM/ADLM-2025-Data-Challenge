Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Generating CU Index
Results
1. PURPOSE
This SOP describes the analytical phase procedures for the
generation of CU Index results in a CLIA-certified laboratory. The CU
Index test is a specialized biomarker assay used to assess immune
dysfunction. This protocol ensures the accuracy and reliability of test
results.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory staff are responsible for following the
procedures outlined in this SOP accurately.
• Supervisors are responsible for overseeing that all steps are
followed correctly and for addressing any issues that arise during
the process.
1. DEFINITION
CU Index (Complement Utilization Index) refers to an assay that
measures the levels of activated complement components in patient
samples. It is used to assess the immune status and potential
autoimmune activity in patients.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies
• Microcentrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Calibrated pipettes and tips
• CU Index assay kit (e.g., provided by a specified manufacturer)
• Reagent grade water
• Calibrators and controls included in the CU Index assay kit
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
B. Sample Preparation
1. Sample Collection and Storage:
◦ Acceptable specimens include fresh serum samples
collected in red-top tubes or serum separator tubes.
◦ Serum should be separated from the clot within two hours of
collection.
◦ Store serum samples at 2-8°C if they are to be tested within
48 hours. For longer storage, freeze samples at -20°C or
below.
2. Sample Handling:
◦ Thaw frozen serum samples at room temperature and mix
gently by inversion.
◦ Centrifuge serum samples at 1500xg for 10 minutes to
remove any particulates before the assay.
C. Assay Procedure
1. Preparation:
◦ Bring all reagents and samples to room temperature before
use.
◦ Follow the manufacturer's instructions for reconstituting any
lyophilized reagents.
◦ Label each microplate well according to the test plan,
including controls and calibrators.
2. Loading the Plate:
◦ Pipette appropriate volumes of patient serum, controls, and
calibrators into the designated wells of the microplate.
◦ Add the specific detection reagent provided in the CU Index
assay kit to each well, following the manufacturer's
instructions.
3. Incubation:
◦ Cover the microplate with a sealing film and incubate the
plate at the specified temperature and time as indicated in
the assay kit instructions.
4. Washing:
◦ After incubation, wash the microplate wells using an
automated plate washer or manually with a multi-channel
pipette.
◦ Repeat the wash step as instructed in the assay manual to
remove unbound reagents.
5. Detection:
◦ Add the substrate solution to each well.
◦ Incubate the plate again at the specified temperature and
time until the color develops.
6. Stopping the Reaction:
◦ Add the stop solution to each well to halt the enzymatic
reaction. The development of color indicates the presence of
activated complement components.
7. Reading the Plate:
◦ Read the absorbance of each well using a microplate reader
set to the appropriate wavelength as specified in the assay
instructions.
◦ Ensure that the reader is calibrated before use to ensure
accurate results.
D. Data Analysis
1. Calculating Results:
◦ Generate a standard curve using the absorbance values of
the calibrators.
◦ Determine the CU Index values of patient samples and
controls by comparing their absorbance to the standard
curve.
2. Quality Control:
◦ Ensure that all controls fall within the acceptable range
provided by the manufacturer.
◦ If quality control samples do not meet criteria, review the
assay procedure, equipment calibration, and reagent
integrity before re-testing.
Reporting Results:
1. Result Verification:
◦ A trained technologist will review the test results for
accuracy and consistency.
◦ Any anomalies or unexpected results should be verified by
re-running the assay.
2. Documentation:
◦ Record all test results, including CU Index values, controls,
and calibrator readings, in the laboratory’s LIS (Laboratory
Information System).
◦ Review and verify the results prior to releasing them to
ensure accuracy.
Reference Intervals:
• Refer to the CU Index assay kit insert for the specific reference
intervals and clinical interpretation guidelines.
Method Limitations:
• Refer to the assay kit instructions for potential limitations and
interferences in the assay's performance.
References:
• CU Index Assay Kit Instruction Manual and Product Insert.
• Laboratory Quality Control Guidelines.
This protocol ensures standardization, accuracy, and reproducibility
in the generation of CU Index results. Any procedural deviations or
anomalies should be promptly addressed and documented according
to the laboratory’s quality management system.
