CXCL13 Immunostain Protocol (Technical Component Only)
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for performing the CXCL13
immunostain on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue
sections, ensuring accurate and reproducible results.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of the trained laboratory technologists to
perform the CXCL13 immunostaining procedure according to this
SOP. A supervisor should review and approve all test results before
they are reported.
1. REAGENTS AND EQUIPMENT
• Reagents:
◦ Primary antibody: Anti-CXCL13 (antibody information to be
provided by the vendor)
◦ Secondary antibody: Appropriate biotinylated or HRP-
conjugated antibody (vendor information required)
◦ Detection system: DAB (3,3'-diaminobenzidine) or other
suitable chromogen
◦ Counterstain: Hematoxylin
◦ Buffer: Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or TRIS-buffered
saline (TBS)
◦ Mounting medium
• Equipment:
◦ Microtome
◦ Water bath
◦ Staining jars/trays
◦ Immunostainer (if automated system is used)
◦ Light microscope
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE)
tissue.
• Slide Preparation: 4-5 micrometer thickness.
1. PROCEDURE
A. PREPARATION: 1. Ensure all reagents and equipment are
prepared and ready for use. 2. Cut 4-5 µm tissue sections and place
them onto positively charged slides. 3. Allow slides to dry at 37°C
overnight or incubate at 60°C for 1 hour.
B. DEPARAFFINIZATION AND REHYDRATION: 1. Deparaffinize
slides by placing them in xylene or suitable clearing agent for three
changes, 5 minutes each. 2. Rehydrate slides through graded
alcohols (100%, 95%, 70%) for 2 minutes each. 3. Rinse slides in
distilled water.
C. ANTIGEN RETRIEVAL: 1. Perform antigen retrieval using a
suitable buffer (e.g., Citrate buffer pH 6.0, EDTA pH 8.0) and heating
method (e.g., microwave, water bath). 2. Allow slides to cool at room
temperature (RT) for 20 minutes. 3. Rinse slides in distilled water and
then in PBS or TBS.
D. BLOCKING STEPS: 1. Block endogenous peroxidase activity by
incubating sections in 3% hydrogen peroxide for 10 minutes. 2. Rinse
slides in PBS or TBS. 3. Block non-specific binding sites using
appropriate serum or protein block provided by the detection kit for
10 minutes. 4. Blot excess blocking solution gently around the tissue
without touching the tissue.
E. PRIMARY ANTIBODY INCUBATION: 1. Incubate the slides with
the primary antibody (Anti-CXCL13) diluted in an appropriate
antibody diluent, at the specified dilution, for 1 hour at RT or
overnight at 4°C. 2. Rinse slides in PBS or TBS.
F. SECONDARY ANTIBODY INCUBATION: 1. Incubate slides with
biotinylated secondary antibody or HRP-conjugated secondary
antibody, according to the manufacturer's instructions, generally for
30 minutes at RT. 2. Rinse slides in PBS or TBS.
G. VISUALIZATION: 1. Incubate slides with the chromogen (e.g.,
DAB) until the desired staining intensity develops, usually between
2-10 minutes. 2. Rinse slides in distilled water. 3. Counterstain with
hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes. 4. Rinse slides in running tap water for 5
minutes.
H. DEHYDRATION AND CLEARING: 1. Dehydrate slides through
graded alcohols (70%, 95%, 100%) for 2 minutes each. 2. Clear in
xylene or suitable clearing agent for 5 minutes, 3 changes. 3.
Coverslip using permanent mounting media.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Positive control slides (tissue known to express CXCL13) must be
run with each batch of test slides.
• Negative control slides (without primary antibody) must be
included to check for non-specific binding.
1. RESULTS REPORTING
• The slides are to be examined under a light microscope by a
qualified pathologist to confirm the presence or absence of
CXCL13 staining.
• The results are to be documented and reviewed following the
laboratory’s result reporting guidelines.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s guidelines for the primary and secondary
antibodies.
• Relevant research articles and laboratory manuals on
immunohistochemistry techniques.
This protocol ensures consistent and accurate staining for CXCL13 in
tissue samples, enabling reliable diagnostic information for
pathologists and clinicians.
