Standard Operating Procedure: Analytical Phase for Generating
Results for CXCL9
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the procedure for the accurate and consistent
analysis of CXCL9 levels from collected and accessioned specimens
using Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA).
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of designated laboratory personnel to perform
the analysis following this SOP. Any issues arising during the process
should be documented and reported to the supervisor.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENT
• Preferred/Acceptable:
◦ Plasma or serum collected within 24 hours.
• Unacceptable:
◦ Specimens clotting, hemolyzed, or otherwise compromised.
Note: Specimens must be stored at 2-8°C if not tested immediately
and can be frozen at -20°C or lower for longer storage.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• CXCL9 ELISA kit
• Microplate reader
• Multichannel pipette and tips
• Micropipettes and tips
• Wash bottle or automated plate washer
• Plate shaker (optional)
• Absorbent paper
• Laboratory timer
• Specimen storage containers
• Reagent reservoirs
4. PROCEDURE
Specimen Preparation:
1. Specimen Thawing (if frozen):
◦ Thaw specimens completely at room temperature.
◦ Mix gently but thoroughly, avoiding the creation of bubbles.
Assay Setup:
1. Reagent Preparation:
◦ Prepare all reagents and materials as outlined in the CXCL9
ELISA kit insert.
◦ Bring all reagents to room temperature before use.
◦ Reconstitute standards, controls, and reagents as specified
in the kit.
2. Plate Preparation:
◦ Label wells for standards, controls, and specimens.
◦ Add 100 µL of each standard, control, and specimen to the
appropriate wells in duplicate.
3. Incubation:
◦ Cover the plate with adhesive film or plate lid.
◦ Incubate the plate for the specified time at room
temperature as indicated by the kit insert.
4. Washing Steps:
◦ Wash wells at least 3-5 times with the provided wash buffer,
making sure not to overflow the wells.
◦ Blot plate on absorbent paper to remove any residual wash
buffer.
5. Detection Antibody Addition:
◦ Add 100 µL of detection antibody to each well.
◦ Cover the plate and incubate as specified.
◦ Wash the wells again following the same washing
procedure.
6. Substrate Addition:
◦ Add 100 µL of the substrate solution to each well.
◦ Incubate as specified, typically in the dark to avoid light-
induced reactions.
7. Stop Solution:
◦ Add 100 µL of stop solution to each well. The solution will
change color, often to yellow.
Reading and Analyzing Results:
1. Plate Reading:
◦ Set up the microplate reader according to the specific
wavelength required (typically 450 nm).
◦ Read the absorbance of each well within 30 minutes of
stopping the reaction.
2. Calculating Results:
◦ Calculate the average absorbance for each standard,
control, and specimen.
◦ Generate a standard curve using a 4-parameter logistic
curve fit to convert the absorbance readings of specimens
into CXCL9 concentration.
◦ Record all calculated results.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run controls with each assay to ensure accuracy.
• QC materials must be analyzed and results should fall within
established acceptable ranges before patient results can be
reported.
• Document all QC results and any deviations.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results are to be reviewed and verified prior to being released.
• Any results outside the normal reference range or with flagged
issues should be double-checked and reported to the supervisor.
• Create and store detailed records and documentation associated
with the assay in aligned LIS (Laboratory Information System).
7. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• The normal range for CXCL9 may vary by source. Refer to the
standard reference intervals established by the laboratory or the
specific ELISA kit insert.
8. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If there are signs of possible sample or reagent contamination,
such as unexpected results, repeat the assay using fresh
reagents and a new specimen.
• Follow the manufacturer’s guidelines to troubleshoot any
instrument or reagent problems.
9. REFERENCE
• CXCL9 ELISA kit insert.
• Laboratory policies and procedures manuals.
