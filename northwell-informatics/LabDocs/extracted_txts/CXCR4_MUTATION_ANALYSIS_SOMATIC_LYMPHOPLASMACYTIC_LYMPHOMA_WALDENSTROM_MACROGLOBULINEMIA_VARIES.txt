SOP: CXCR4 Mutation Analysis, Somatic, Lymphoplasmacytic
Lymphoma/Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedures for the analytical phase of generating
results for CXCR4 mutation analysis, focusing on somatic mutations
in cases of lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma/Waldenstrom
macroglobulinemia.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to personnel conducting the CXCR4 mutation
analysis in the molecular diagnostics laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
Laboratory personnel are responsible for carrying out the mutation
analysis as specified in this SOP. The supervisory staff is responsible
for ensuring that the procedure is followed appropriately and for
troubleshooting any issues that may arise.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Bone marrow aspirates, blood (EDTA or
heparin), or formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue
sections.
• Specimen Volume: Minimum of 3-5 mL of bone marrow aspirate
or blood; for FFPE, at least ten 5-micron sections or one core
biopsy.
• Specimen Stability: Process within 48 hours of collection for
fresh specimens. FFPE sections should be stored at room
temperature until ready for processing.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• DNA extraction kit (validated for use with the sample types)
• PCR reagents and consumables
• Thermocycler
• CXCR4-specific primers and probes
• Gel electrophoresis setup (if applicable)
• Real-Time PCR (qPCR) or Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS)
platform
• DNA quantification instrument (e.g., Qubit, Nanodrop)
• Positive and negative control DNA samples
• Molecular grade water and other reagents
6. PROCEDURE
A) DNA Extraction
1. Extract DNA from the specimen using a validated DNA
extraction kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Measure the DNA concentration and purity using a DNA
quantification instrument.
3. Normalize DNA concentration to the required concentration for
PCR.
B) PCR Amplification
1. Prepare the PCR master mix as per the manufacturer’s
instructions, including:
◦ DNA template (optimal concentration as per standard
protocol)
◦ CXCR4-specific primers
◦ dNTP mix
◦ MgCl2 (if necessary)
◦ Taq DNA polymerase
◦ Buffer solution
2. Aliquot the PCR master mix into PCR tubes or a 96-well plate.
3. Add the DNA template to each tube/well.
4. Run the PCR reaction in a thermocycler with the following
conditions (example):
◦ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 3 minutes
◦ Denaturation: 95°C for 30 seconds
◦ Annealing: 58-60°C for 30 seconds
◦ Extension: 72°C for 45 seconds
◦ Number of cycles: 35-40
◦ Final extension: 72°C for 5 minutes
C) Mutation Detection
For conventional PCR followed by Sanger Sequencing:
1. Purify PCR products using a PCR purification kit according to
the manufacturer’s protocol.
2. Prepare PCR purified products for sequencing.
3. Submit samples for Sanger sequencing.
For Real-Time PCR (qPCR):
1. Prepare qPCR master mix including CXCR4-specific probes.
2. Load qPCR master mix into a qPCR plate.
3. Add the DNA template.
4. Perform qPCR as per the manufacturer's protocol and analyze
the amplification plot for mutation-specific signals.
For Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS):
1. Prepare libraries using commercially available NGS library
preparation kits.
2. Sequence on an appropriate NGS platform.
3. Analyze data using bioinformatics tools to call mutations.
D) Data Interpretation
1. Analyze sequencing results to identify the CXCR4 mutations.
2. For qPCR, determine the presence or absence of mutations
based on quantification cycle (Cq) values.
3. For NGS, review reads and mutation calls using bioinformatics
analysis tools.
4. Compare findings with known mutation databases and literature
to interpret the clinical significance of detected mutations.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Include positive and negative controls in each PCR run to
ensure assay specificity and sensitivity.
2. Document lot numbers of all reagents and ensure they are
within the expiry date.
3. Review quality of sequencing reads or amplification curves for
each run.
4. Record all observations and any deviations from the expected
outcomes.
8. REPORTING
1. Document findings and interpretations in standardized format.
2. Ensure all results must be reviewed and verified by a qualified
technologist or laboratory director.
3. Report final results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
with appropriate comments and interpretations correlating with
the clinical context.
