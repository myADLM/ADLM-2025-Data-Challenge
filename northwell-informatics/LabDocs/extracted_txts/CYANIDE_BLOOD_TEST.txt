CYANIDE, BLOOD TEST - ANALYTICAL PHASE PROTOCOL
1. PURPOSE This procedure outlines the steps for the analytical
phase of Cyanide Blood Test to ensure accurate and reliable
test results.
Responsibility:
• All designated laboratory personnel are responsible for following
this protocol.
• The laboratory supervisor ensures compliance with the procedure
and handles any deviations or issues.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS Preferred/Acceptable:
• An anticoagulated whole blood sample collected using sodium
fluoride/potassium oxalate grey-top tubes.
• Minimum volume required: 5 mL.
• Samples must be stored and transported at 2-8°C.
Unacceptable:
• Hemolyzed samples.
• Samples collected in anticoagulants other than sodium fluoride/
potassium oxalate.
• Specimens that are clotted or not collected in the appropriate tube
type.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Spectrophotometer/HPLC/GC-MS (whichever applicable to your
lab setup).
• Reagents specific for cyanide analysis (prepare or obtain
according to manufacturer’s instructions).
• Certified reference materials (CRMs) or calibration standards.
• Quality control materials (both negative and positive controls).
1. PROCEDURE A) Sample Preparation
2. Ensure that the specimen is at room temperature before
analysis.
3. Gently mix the sample by inverting the collection tube 5-10
times.
4. For spectrophotometric analysis, prepare the sample and
reagents according to the instructional insert included with the
reagents kit. Standard sample extraction protocols for HPLC/
GC-MS should be adhered to.
B) Calibration and Quality Control
1. Calibrate the analytical instrument using certified reference
standards before processing patient samples.
2. Run quality control samples (negative and positive controls)
with each batch of patient samples to ensure the accuracy and
precision of the test results.
C) Analyzing the Sample
1. Load the prepared blood sample onto the instrument according
to the manufacturer’s guidelines.
2. Follow the operating procedure specific to the instrument
(spectrophotometer/HPLC/GC-MS) for cyanide detection and
quantification.
◦ Set appropriate parameters (wavelength, run-time, sample
volume, etc.).
3. Document the date, time, and initials of the technologist
performing the analysis.
D) Data Collection and Analysis
1. Retrieve the data from the instrument and perform the
necessary calculations to quantify cyanide levels in the blood
sample.
2. Verify the integrity and validity of the data by ensuring
calibration and control results fall within acceptable limits.
3. Record results and any necessary numerical values in the
laboratory information system (LIS).
4. REPORTING RESULTS
5. Ensure that results are correctly documented within the LIS,
including any abnormal or critical values.
6. For critical results (cyanide levels > 0.2 mg/L or as defined by
your lab’s critical value range), follow the laboratory policy for
notifying the appropriate clinical personnel immediately.
7. Add any necessary comments or notes to the laboratory report,
especially if there were any procedural deviations or sample
issues.
8. QUALITY CONTROL AND MAINTENANCE A) Daily/Batch
Quality Control
• Run QC samples at the start and end of each analytical run.
• Log all QC results in the appropriate QC logbook or LIS module.
B) Instrument Maintenance
• Regularly scheduled preventive maintenance must be performed
on all analytical instruments as defined in the instrument’s user
manual.
• Document each maintenance activity, calibration, and repair
performed.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instruction manual for the analytical instrument
(spectrophotometer/HPLC/GC-MS).
• Certified reference materials and reagents documentation.
• Internal laboratory SOP for quality control and calibration
procedures.
1. LIMITATIONS AND NOTES
• Analyze samples within a specified timeframe to minimize
potential degradation of cyanide.
• Verify that sample handling, transport, and storage conditions are
consistent with the lab’s standard protocols to ensure sample
integrity.
• Refer to cyanide test-specific guidelines and instrument manuals
for detailed procedural limitations and troubleshooting advice.
