Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase of Generating Results for Cyclic Adenosine
Monophosphate (cAMP), Urinary Excretion, Serum, and Urine
1. PURPOSE
To provide detailed instructions for the analysis of cyclic adenosine
monophosphate (cAMP) levels in serum and urine samples, ensuring
accurate and reliable results.
1. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel involved in the analysis
of cAMP in serum and urine samples.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
Laboratory technologists are responsible for performing the analysis
as outlined in this SOP. The laboratory supervisor is responsible for
ensuring compliance with this procedure and addressing any
deviations or issues.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen:
• Preferred/acceptable for Serum:
◦ 5 mL of blood collected in a serum separator tube (SST). Allow
blood to clot and centrifuge at 3000 RPM for 10 minutes to
obtain serum.
• Preferred/acceptable for Urine:
◦ 10 mL of freshly voided urine collected in a clean container.
Urine should be kept refrigerated and analyzed within 24
hours of collection.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed serum samples
• Urine samples with visible contamination or not refrigerated.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• HPLC (High-Performance Liquid Chromatography) system or
ELISA (Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay) kits for cAMP
analysis.
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Disposable gloves
• Micropipettes
• Vortex mixer
1. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation
1. Serum: a. Centrifuge the SST tube at 3000 RPM for 10
minutes. b. Aliquot the serum into a clean, labeled
microcentrifuge tube. c. Store serum at -20°C if not analyzed
immediately.
2. Urine: a. Mix the urine sample thoroughly. b. Aliquot 5-10 mL of
urine into a clean, labeled container. c. Store urine at -20°C if
not analyzed immediately.
B. HPLC Analysis
1. Set up the HPLC system according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
2. Prepare calibration standards and quality control (QC) samples.
3. Inject the prepared serum or urine sample into the HPLC
system.
4. Run the analysis according to the HPLC method parameters.
5. Analyze the peaks and calculate the cAMP concentration using
the calibration curve.
C. ELISA Analysis
1. Perform the assay according to the ELISA kit instructions.
2. Prepare reagents, standards, controls, and samples.
3. Pipette standards, controls, and samples into appropriate wells.
4. Incubate plates as per kit instructions.
5. Wash wells and add the detection reagent.
6. Read absorbance at the specified wavelength using a
microplate reader.
7. Calculate cAMP concentration using the standard curve.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run quality control samples with each batch of samples to ensure
the accuracy and reliability of results.
• Document all QC results and ensure they are within acceptable
ranges before reporting patient results.
• Recalibrate the HPLC system or troubleshoot ELISA assays if QC
results are out of range.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Enter the results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Verify and validate the results before releasing them to the
healthcare provider.
• Ensure that any comments or notes regarding sample integrity or
deviations from protocol are documented in the patient's record.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Serum cAMP: 2.0-10.0 pmol/mL (reference range may vary based
on population and assay used).
• Urine cAMP: 1.0-5.0 nmol/mL (reference range may vary based
on population and assay used).
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples may interfere with the
assay's accuracy.
• Contaminated urine samples may yield unreliable results.
• Ensure proper sample handling and storage to prevent
degradation.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's instructions for HPLC systems and ELISA kits
used.
• Clinical guidelines for cAMP measurement and interpretation.
1. DOCUMENT CONTROL
• Review and update this SOP annually or as needed to reflect
changes in equipment, procedures, or regulatory requirements.
1. TRAINING AND COMPETENCY
• All laboratory personnel performing this analysis must be trained
and demonstrate competency in the procedure.
