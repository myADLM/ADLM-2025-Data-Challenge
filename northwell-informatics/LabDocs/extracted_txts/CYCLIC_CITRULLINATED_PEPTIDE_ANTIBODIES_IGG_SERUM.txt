Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) for the Analytical Phase
of Generating Results for Cyclic Citrullinated Peptide Antibodies
(CCP), IgG, Serum
1. PURPOSE
To establish standardized procedures for analyzing Cyclic
Citrullinated Peptide (CCP) Antibodies, IgG, in serum specimens
using validated immunoassay techniques. This SOP ensures
accurate, reliable, and reproducible results that contribute to the
diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel responsible for
performing the CCP IgG antibody test in the clinical laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of assigned laboratory personnel to perform
and document all steps and quality controls as outlined in this SOP. It
is also their responsibility to identify any deviations or issues and
report them to supervisory staff immediately.
4. MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT
4.1 Equipment:
• Automated immunoassay analyzer (e.g., ELISA reader,
chemiluminescence immunoassay analyzer)
• Computer with Laboratory Information System (LIS) access
• Centrifuge
• Micropipettes and tips
• Calibrated refrigerator (2-8°C) and freezer (-20°C)
4.2 Reagents and Supplies:
• CCP IgG test kits (specific brand and part number as per current
laboratory stock)
• Control sera (negative, low positive, high positive)
• Serum separator tubes (SST) or plain red-top tubes
• Sample diluent, wash buffers, substrate reagents, stop solutions
(as per kit requirements)
• Calibrators
5. SAFETY PRECAUTIONS
• Use personal protective equipment (PPE) including lab coats,
gloves, and eye protection.
• Handle all specimens and reagents as potentially biohazardous.
• Follow waste disposal guidelines for biohazardous materials.
6. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
6.1 Acceptable Specimens:
• Serum collected in SST or red-top tube.
6.2 Handling and Storage:
• After collection, centrifuge and separate serum within 2 hours.
• Specimens can be stored at 2-8°C for up to 48 hours.
• For long-term storage, freeze specimens at -20°C or lower.
• Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
7. PROCEDURE
7.1 Preparation:
• Thaw frozen specimens at room temperature and mix thoroughly
by gentle inversion before analysis.
• Allow all reagents and calibrators to reach room temperature
before use (unless otherwise specified by the manufacturer).
7.2 Calibration and Quality Control:
• Run calibrators and controls according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
• Ensure the instrument calibration is valid before proceeding with
sample analysis.
• Verify that quality control results are within acceptable limits prior
to testing patient samples.
7.3 Sample Testing:
• Load specimens, controls, and calibrators onto the analyzer as
per manufacturer’s instruction.
• Program the instrument according to the specific test assay
manual, including incubation times and temperatures.
7.4 Data Interpretation and Reporting:
• After the assay is completed, review the generated data to ensure
it meets quality control criteria.
• Report results using the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• For tests with internal flags or errors, re-assay or follow
troubleshooting guidelines, if applicable.
• Refer critical values and discrepancies to the supervisory
personnel for further action.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Cross-reactivity or interference from other autoantibodies may
occur; read manufacturer's instructions for specific limitations.
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples may affect test results.
• Results from this test should be used in conjunction with other
clinical and laboratory findings.
9. DOCUMENTATION
• Maintain logs for reagent lot numbers, calibrations, control results,
and maintenance records.
• Document and address any non-conformities or deviations
encountered during the analytical process.
• Ensure all reporting and documentation procedures adhere to
CLIA regulations and laboratory standard practices.

This protocol must be reviewed and approved by the laboratory
director or designated personnel at least annually or whenever
changes in procedures are implemented. All staff must be trained and
validated for competency regularly.
