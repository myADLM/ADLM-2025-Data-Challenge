STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP) FOR THE
ANALYTICAL PHASE OF CYCLIC CITRULLINATED PEPTIDE
(CCP Ab), ANTIBODY, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the procedures for the analytical phase of CCP Ab
testing, including preparation, analysis, and quality control to ensure
accurate and reliable results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
• Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing and
documenting the CCP Ab analysis.
• It is the responsibility of the laboratory supervisor to ensure all
procedures are followed and any issues are addressed promptly.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Acceptable Specimen:
• Serum sample – Collect blood into a plain, red-top tube or an SST
(serum separator tube).
• Allow the blood to clot at room temperature for at least 30 minutes
and then centrifuge for 10 minutes at 1500-2000 g.
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Serum specimens that are hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric.
• Inadequately labeled specimens or those with insufficient volume.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• CCP Ab reagent kit (Ensure within expiry date)
• Responsible Instrument (e.g., ELISA plate reader or automated
immunoassay analyzer)
• Calibrators and Controls (provided with the reagent kit or
independently validated)
• Micropipettes and disposable tips
• 96-well microplates (if using ELISA)
• Wash Buffer
• Substrate Solution
5. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Review the requisition form and accompanying specimen for
appropriate labeling and volume.
2. Centrifuge any unprocessed blood samples as described in
Section 3.
3. Label microplates or test tubes clearly with patient and control
identifiers.
Analysis:
1. Manual ELISA Method:
◦ Bring all reagents and samples to room temperature before
use.
◦ Pipette an appropriate volume of standards, controls, and
patient samples (usually 50-100 µL) into designated wells
on the microplate.
◦ Add CCP Ab conjugate to each well and incubate per kit
instructions (typically 60 minutes at room temperature).
◦ Wash microplates carefully to remove unbound material,
using the provided wash buffer.
◦ Add substrate solution to wells and incubate as directed
(usually 10-20 minutes, avoiding direct light).
◦ Add stop solution to halt the enzymatic reaction.
◦ Read absorbance using the plate reader at the specified
wavelength (usually 450 nm).
2. Automated Analysis Method:
◦ Load prepared serum samples into the designated racks/
carousels of the automated analyzer.
◦ Ensure the instrument has been properly calibrated and
daily QC runs are within acceptable limits.
◦ Follow the instrument’s operational manual to initiate the
run.
◦ Monitor the instrument’s status and address any alerts or
errors promptly.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run calibrators and controls provided with the reagent kit with
each batch of patient samples.
• Ensure QC results fall within the manufacturer’s specified range
before reporting patient results.
• Document all QC results and any corrective actions taken if QC
results fall outside the acceptable range.
7. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
• Compare patient sample readings to the calibration curve to
derive the concentration of CCP Ab.
• Review all results in the context of QC data to ensure validity.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results should be entered into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS) as soon as available.
• Review and verify the results before releasing them.
• Notify the requesting physician or clinician of any critical results
promptly.
9. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s package insert for CCP Ab reagent kit
• Internal SOPs for instrument operation and maintenance
• Relevant clinical guidelines for CCP Ab reporting and
interpretation
10. RECORD KEEPING
• Maintain all records of sample processing, QC data, calibration
curves, and any troubleshooting actions taken.
• Ensure traceability of all results reported by retaining detailed
documentation.
11. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If QC failures or instrument errors occur, follow the
troubleshooting guide provided by the instrument or reagent
manufacturer.
• Document any issues and corrective actions taken.
• Consult with laboratory supervisor for persistent problems.
