Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Cyclin D1
Immunostain, Technical Component Only
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for performing Cyclin D1
immunohistochemical staining in order to identify and visualize the
presence and distribution of Cyclin D1 protein in tissue sections. This
procedure only covers the technical component of the
immunostaining process.
Responsibility:
• The pathology technologists are responsible for performing the
immunostain according to this procedure.
• The pathology supervisor must ensure that all staff are trained
and comply with this SOP.
2. DEFINITION
Cyclin D1 is a protein involved in cell cycle regulation.
Overexpression of Cyclin D1 can be seen in a variety of neoplasms
and is a significant marker for certain types of cancer.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Fully automated immunostainer (e.g., Ventana Benchmark, Dako
Autostainer)
• Microscope slides with paraffin-embedded tissue sections
• Cover slips and mounting medium
• Cyclin D1 primary antibody [specify supplier and catalog number]
• Secondary antibody and detection system [specify supplier and
catalog number]
• Positive and negative control slides
• Reagents: xylene, alcohol, distilled water, antigen retrieval buffer
(e.g., Citrate buffer pH 6.0), blocking buffer
• Hematoxylin counterstain
• Digital Microscope or light microscope for slide analysis
4. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation of Slides:
1. Set up the workspace in a clean and organized manner.
2. Label all required slides with patient identification number and
date.
3. Ensure tissue sections are appropriately deparaffinized and
rehydrated by the following steps:
◦ Xylene: 2 changes, 5 minutes each
◦ 100% ethanol: 2 changes, 5 minutes each
◦ 95% ethanol: 1 change, 5 minutes
◦ Rinse in distilled water
B. Antigen Retrieval:
1. Immerse slides in a preheated antigen retrieval buffer (Citrate
buffer pH 6.0) using a microwave, pressure cooker, or water
bath at 95-100°C for 15-20 minutes.
2. Allow slides to cool for 20 minutes at room temperature.
3. Rinse slides in distilled water.
C. Immunostaining Workflow:
1. Place the slides in the automated immunostainer.
2. Program the immunostainer to perform the following steps:
◦ Apply blocking buffer to each slide (duration: as specified by
the supplier).
◦ Incubate slides with primary Cyclin D1 antibody (dilution and
incubation time as optimized, typically 30-60 minutes).
◦ Rinse slides with buffer.
◦ Apply secondary antibody and detection system (follow
manufacturer’s instructions for incubation time).
◦ Rinse slides with buffer.
◦ Counterstain with hematoxylin (duration as specified by
manufacturer).
D. Control Validation:
1. Include a positive control slide (known tissue containing Cyclin
D1) and a negative control slide (primary antibody omitted) with
each batch of staining to ensure proper assay performance.
E. Slide Mounting:
1. Dehydrate the stained slides through graded ethanol and clear
in xylene:
◦ 95% ethanol: 1 change, 5 minutes
◦ 100% ethanol: 2 changes, 5 minutes each
◦ Xylene: 3 changes, 5 minutes each
2. Mount coverslips using an appropriate mounting medium.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
• Review and document the staining of positive and negative
controls to validate each staining run.
• Any deviations from expected results must be documented and
investigated.
• Regularly maintain and calibrate equipment as per manufacturer
instructions.
6. REPORTING OF RESULTS:
• Once staining is completed, the slides will be handed back to the
pathologist for interpretation.
• Ensure all slides are properly labeled and recorded in the
laboratory information system (LIS).
7. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS:
• Handle all reagents and human tissue specimens using standard
universal precautions.
• Dispose of all waste materials according to laboratory safety
protocols.
• Ensure proper ventilation and use personal protective equipment
(PPE) like gloves and lab coats.

9. DOCUMENTATION
• Record all observations, including control slide performance, in
the laboratory logbook or electronic system.
• Maintain records for review and quality improvement processes.
This SOP will ensure consistent and reliable performance of Cyclin
D1 immunostain, enabling accurate technical preparation for further
diagnostic interpretation by pathologists.
This protocol should be reviewed and approved by a laboratory
supervisor or designated committee before implementation.
