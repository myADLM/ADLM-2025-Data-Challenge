Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analysis of
Cyclobenzaprine (Flexeril) in Patient Samples
1. PURPOSE:
To provide a standardized methodology for the analysis of
Cyclobenzaprine (Flexeril) in patient samples using high-performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC) with UV detection to ensure accurate
and precise results.
2. SCOPE:
This SOP applies to all personnel involved in the analysis of
Cyclobenzaprine in patient specimens in the clinical laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY:
It is the responsibility of all trained laboratory staff to follow this
procedure accurately and to ensure that proper documentation is
maintained for all steps and results. The designated supervisor must
review and approve all critical results and discrepancies.
4. DEFINITIONS:
• Cyclobenzaprine (Flexeril): A muscle relaxant used to relieve
skeletal muscle spasms.
• HPLC: High-Performance Liquid Chromatography, a technique in
analytical chemistry used to separate, identify, and quantify each
component in a mixture.
• UV Detection: Ultraviolet detection, a method used in HPLC for
detecting eluting substances.
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS:
• Type: Plasma or serum.
• Volume: Minimum of 2 mL.
• Collection Container: Vacutainer® with EDTA or serum
separator tube (SST).
• Transport and Storage: Samples should be transported to the
laboratory at 2-8°C and analyzed within 48 hours of collection. If
analysis is delayed, samples should be frozen at -20°C and can
remain stable for up to one month.
6. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS and SUPPLIES:
• HPLC system with UV detector.
• Analytical column: C18 reverse phase column (250 x 4.6 mm,
particle size 5 µm).
• Mobile phase: Buffer solution (10 mM ammonium acetate, pH
4.0): acetonitrile (60:40, v/v).
• Standard Cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride.
• Internal standard solution (e.g., Amitriptyline hydrochloride).
• Calibration standards and quality control materials.
• Sample preparation materials (e.g., centrifuge, pipettes, filtration
equipment).
7. PROCEDURE:
7.1 Sample Preparation:
1. Centrifuge the sample: Spin blood collection tubes at 3000
rpm for 10 minutes at 2-8°C.
2. Separation: Collect the plasma or serum supernatant without
disturbing the cell layer.
3. Aliquot: Transfer 500 µL of sample to a clean test tube.
4. Internal Standard Addition: Add 50 µL of internal standard
solution (Amitriptyline hydrochloride) to each sample.
5. Protein Precipitation: Add 1 mL acetonitrile, vortex for 30
seconds, and centrifuge at 12000 rpm for 15 minutes.
6. Filtration: Filter supernatant through a 0.2 µm syringe filter into
an HPLC vial.
7.2 HPLC Analysis:
1. HPLC Setup:
◦ Equilibrate the HPLC system with the mobile phase.
◦ Set the flow rate to 1.0 mL/min.
◦ Set the detector wavelength to 254 nm.
◦ Inject 20 µL of each sample, calibration standard, and
quality control material.
2. Calibration Curve:
◦ Prepare a series of calibration standards of
Cyclobenzaprine in plasma/serum ranging from 1 ng/mL to
100 ng/mL.
◦ Plot peak area ratios against the concentration of
Cyclobenzaprine to create a calibration curve.
3. Run Samples:
◦ Inject a blank sample to ensure no carryover.
◦ Inject calibration standards to ensure proper calibration
before and after running patient samples.
◦ Inject patient samples and note retention times and peak
areas.
◦ Similarly, inject quality control samples at low, medium, and
high concentrations.
7.3 Data Analysis:
1. Data Interpretation:
◦ Calculate the concentration of Cyclobenzaprine in patient
samples using the calibration curve.
◦ Verify that quality control samples are within acceptable
range.
2. Reporting:
◦ Report all results in ng/mL.
◦ Document any deviations or errors encountered during
analysis.
8. QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE:
1. Quality Control Materials:
◦ Use quality control samples to validate each run.
◦ Run controls at the beginning, middle, and end of each
batch.
2. Performance Checks:
◦ Ensure HPLC system performance by regularly running
system suitability tests.
◦ Ensure the calibration curve has an R² value of at least
0.99.
3. Documentation:
◦ Record all temperatures, logbook entries, and any
deviations.
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
Ensure samples are free from hemolysis and lipemia. The method
may have interferences particularly in patients taking medications
chemically similar to Cyclobenzaprine.
