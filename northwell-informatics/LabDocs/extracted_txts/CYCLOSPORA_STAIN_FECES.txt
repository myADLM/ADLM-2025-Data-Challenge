Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Cyclospora Stain in
Feces
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this protocol is to define standardized procedures for
the identification of Cyclospora cayetanensis oocysts in fecal
specimens using the modified acid-fast stain method. Accurate
detection of Cyclospora assists in the diagnosis and treatment of
cyclosporiasis.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of laboratory personnel to adhere to this SOP
for the preparation, staining, and examination of fecal specimens for
Cyclospora. Supervisors must ensure that personnel are adequately
trained and adhere to this SOP.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type:
• Unpreserved stool or stool preserved in 10% formalin, polyvinyl
alcohol (PVA), or Cary-Blair transport medium.
Specimen Collection:
• Collect a minimum of 5 grams of fresh stool.
• Specimens should be collected in a sterile, leak-proof container.
• Stool should ideally be collected during the acute stage of illness
and sent to the lab promptly.
Specimen Stability:
• Unpreserved stool: Up to 2 hours at room temperature.
• Preserved stool: Stable for up to 7 days when refrigerated
(2-8°C).
Rejection Criteria:
• Specimens collected with improper preservatives.
• Specimens with visible contamination.
• Specimens with insufficient volume.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Biological safety cabinet (BSC).
• Microscope with 1000x magnification capability (oil immersion).
• Centrifuge.
Reagents:
• Absolute methanol.
• Kinyoun carbol fuchsin stain.
• Acid-alcohol decolorizer (1% sulfuric acid).
• Methylene blue counterstain (0.25%).
Supplies:
• Glass slides and coverslips.
• Applicator sticks or wooden sticks.
• Staining racks.
• Immersion oil.
5. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Perform a gross examination of the stool specimen, noting
color, consistency, and any visible parasites.
2. Label a clean glass slide with the patient’s identification
information.
3. Using an applicator stick, apply a small amount of stool to the
slide, creating a thin smear.
Staining Protocol:
1. Allow the smear to air dry completely, or heat-fix briefly.
2. Fix the smear by immersing the slide in absolute methanol for 1
minute. Allow to air dry.
3. Place the slide on the staining rack.
4. Flood the smear with Kinyoun carbol fuchsin stain for 3-5
minutes.
5. Rinse the slide gently with water to remove excess stain.
6. Decolorize with acid-alcohol for 1-2 minutes, or until the slide
looks pale pink.
7. Rinse the slide gently with water to stop the decolorization.
8. Counterstain with methylene blue for 1-2 minutes.
9. Rinse the slide gently with water, and allow to air dry.
Microscopy:
1. Place a coverslip over the stained smear.
2. Observe the entire smear under low power (10x) to locate
areas of interest.
3. Examine under high power (40x) and confirm the identification
using oil immersion (1000x).
4. Cyclospora oocysts typically appear as spherical, oval, or
slightly irregularly shaped structures that are 8-10 µm in
diameter and stain light pink to red with a granular interior.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Use known positive and negative controls with each batch of
samples to ensure stain efficacy.
• Document the performance of controls in the laboratory log.
• Examine a control slide to verify that the staining process is
functioning correctly; positive control slides must display
appropriately stained oocysts.
7. RESULT REPORTING
• Record the presence or absence of Cyclospora oocysts.
• Report results accurately and promptly in the Laboratory
Information System (LIS) according to site-specific reporting
guidelines.
• Critical or unusual findings must be communicated immediately to
the responsible physician and documented properly.
8. REFERENCE INTERVALS:
Results will be reported qualitatively as:
• Cyclospora oocysts detected.
• No Cyclospora oocysts detected.
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• The modified acid-fast stain method is specific for Cyclospora, but
other coccidian parasites like Cryptosporidium may also stain
partially.
• Stool specimens must be adequately fixed and stained to ensure
accurate identification.
