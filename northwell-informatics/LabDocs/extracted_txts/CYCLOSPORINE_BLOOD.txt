STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES (SOP)
1. PURPOSE
To ensure the accurate and precise analysis of Cyclosporine levels in
blood samples using standard validated procedures. This SOP
outlines the process for analysis, necessary equipment, reagents,
quality control, and reporting of results for Cyclosporine, Blood.
1. SCOPE
This protocol applies to all laboratory personnel involved in the
analysis of Cyclosporine levels in blood samples and includes all
associated analytical activities from preparation to result reporting.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
The laboratory staff performing the test are responsible for following
this protocol accurately.
The laboratory supervisor is responsible for ensuring the
implementation and compliance with this SOP.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
• Preferred Specimen Type: Whole blood collected in EDTA-treated
tubes.
• Alternative Specimen Types: Heparinized blood is acceptable but
not preferred.
• Specimen Volume: Minimum 2 mL whole blood.
• Stability: Samples should be kept at room temperature (20-26°C)
if analysis will be done within 24 hours. Otherwise, refrigerate at
2-8°C and analyze within 5 days.
• Transport: Transport specimens in a leak-proof container at
appropriate conditions as described.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS & SUPPLIES
• Analyzers capable of Cyclosporine analysis (e.g., HPLC, LC-MS/
MS).
• Reagents: Cyclosporine calibration standards and quality controls
provided by the manufacturer.
• Supplies: EDTA tubes, pipettes, appropriate sample cups,
calibration solutions, and controls.
1. PROCEDURE
A) Pre-Analysis:
• Confirm patient identification and specimen integrity.
• Label all samples appropriately and log into the laboratory
information system (LIS).
• Allow refrigerated samples to come to room temperature before
analysis.
B) Calibration and Quality Control:
• Calibration: Prepare calibration curve according to the
manufacturer's instructions. Perform at the beginning of each
analytical run.
• Quality Control: Run at least two levels of quality control material
(low and high) at the beginning and end of each analytical batch.
Ensure the QC values are within acceptable limits before
proceeding with patient sample analysis.
C) Sample Preparation:
• Using a calibrated micropipette, aliquot a specified volume of the
blood sample and follow the extraction procedure according to the
methodology used (e.g., for LC-MS/MS).
• Process the samples using the steps provided in the commercial
kit or according to the standard method protocol validated in the
laboratory.
D) Analysis:
• Load the prepared samples into the instrument.
• Select the appropriate method for Cyclosporine detection.
• Start the analytical run and monitor the analysis as per standard
operating procedures.
• Ensure proper documentation of any deviations or instrument
alerts/failures during the run.
E) Post-Analysis:
• Review all QC results before releasing patient results. Any QC
failure must be resolved before patient results can be reported.
• The results of Cyclosporine concentrations will automatically be
transmitted to the LIS.
• Technologists must manually review and verify the results before
final reporting.
1. REPORTING RESULTS:
Refer to site-specific reporting guidelines for entering and verifying
Cyclosporine results.
• Include reference ranges in the report: Refer to standard
reference intervals established in the laboratory (varies based on
methods and patient context).
• Report flagged critical values immediately to the appropriate
healthcare provider and document all communications as per
standard laboratory protocol.
1. RECORD KEEPING:
• Maintain daily logs of temperatures, calibration runs, and QC
results.
• Document any troubleshooting attempts and corrective actions
performed.
• Ensure all records are kept according to CLIA regulations and
laboratory policies.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
• Ensure all personnel are aware of method limitations as described
by the reagent and instrument manufacturer.
• High lipemia, hemolysis, or other interfering substances should be
noted and procedures followed for minimizing these effects.
1. REFERENCES:
• Manufacturer’s instructions for calibrators, QC materials, and
extraction kits.
• Laboratory method validation files for Cyclosporine analysis.
• CLIA regulations for laboratory testing of therapeutic drug levels.
1. REVIEW AND APPROVAL:
• This SOP should be reviewed annually or upon any significant
modifications in the procedure or equipment.
• Approved by: [Lab Supervisor / Manager]
• Date of Last Review: [MM/DD/YYYY]
