SOP for Analytical Phase of Generating Results for
Cyclosporine, Peak, Blood
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for the accurate and precise analysis of
Cyclosporine levels in blood, ensuring reliable results are generated
through this SOP.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
The responsibility for performing and documenting each step of this
procedure lies with the designated Medical Laboratory Scientist or
Technician. Supervisors must ensure that all staff members are
trained and competent in this protocol.
3. DEFINITION
Cyclosporine is an immunosuppressant used to prevent organ
transplant rejection. Peak blood levels of Cyclosporine are typically
measured two hours post-dose to monitor therapeutic drug levels and
adjust dosing.
4. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
• LC-MS/MS Instrument or HPLC
• Calibrated Micropipettes and Tips
• Centrifuge
• Refrigerated inventory for samples and reagents
• Reagents: Calibrators, Controls, Internal Standards, Mobile
Phase solvents
• Blood Collection Tubes (preferably EDTA)
• Automation system for sample transfer (if applicable)
5. PROCEDURE
Pre-analytical Considerations
1. Ensure all reagents and instrumentation are prepared as per
manufacturer recommendations.
2. Verify that the reagent lot numbers are properly documented.
3. Use appropriate PPE and adhere to biosafety guidelines while
handling samples.
Sample Preparation
1. Upon receipt, ensure blood samples are labeled correctly with
patient information and time of collection.
2. Verify that the samples are collected in EDTA tubes and within
the required time post-dose.
3. Centrifuge the blood samples at 2000-2500 RPM for 10
minutes to separate plasma/serum.
4. Transfer the clear plasma/serum to a labeled storage vial.
5. Store the aliquots at -20°C if immediate analysis is not possible.
Calibration and Quality Control
1. Prepare calibration standards and quality control samples
according to the manufacturer's guidelines.
2. Run calibration standards and control samples through the LC-
MS/MS or HPLC to verify system calibration.
3. Utilize two levels of QC material (within therapeutic and toxic
range) to validate the run.
Cyclosporine Measurement
1. Allow samples (calibrators, QCs, and patient samples) to thaw
at room temperature if previously frozen.
2. Prepare the samples as per the analytical method discussed in
the validated protocol (e.g., protein precipitation, solid-phase
extraction).
3. Load the prepared samples onto the LC-MS/MS or HPLC
system.
4. Set up the analytical run, ensuring the appropriate method file
for Cyclosporine is selected.
5. Initiate the sample run, and monitor the system for any errors or
deviations during operation.
Data Analysis
1. After the run, review the chromatograms and calibration curve
for accuracy and precision.
2. Inspect QC data to ensure it falls within the acceptable criteria.
3. Quantify the Cyclosporine levels in patient samples using the
generated calibration curve.
4. If QC results are outside acceptable ranges or if there are any
notable anomalies in patient results, reanalyze the affected
samples.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Transmit the validated results from the LC-MS/MS or HPLC
system to the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
2. Include qualitative and quantitative comments, if any, based on
the chromatogram observations.
3. Ensure that any sample results flagged for review are
addressed and validated before result release.
7. SAMPLE INTEGRITY AND REJECTION
1. Check for any signs of hemolysis or clots in the plasma/serum.
If these are present, reject the sample and request a recollect.
2. Panic/critical values must be communicated immediately to the
attending physician as per the laboratory's critical result policy.
8. REFERENCES
1. Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines.
2. Manufacturer’s guidelines for LC-MS/MS operation for
Cyclosporine assay.
3. Internal validation documents and historical QC trends.
9. QUALITY CONTROL AND MAINTENANCE
1. Run daily system suitability tests and calibrations for the LC-
MS/MS or HPLC.
2. Document the maintenance and any corrective actions in the
instrument log.
3. Semi-annual performance reviews and inter-laboratory
comparisons (if applicable).
10. TROUBLESHOOTING
1. Refer to the LC-MS/MS or HPLC manual for common
troubleshooting tips.
2. Record any instrument errors and the steps taken to resolve
them.
3. If persistent issues occur, escalate to the supervisor or contact
technical support.
This SOP is to be reviewed annually or following any significant
changes in testing methodology. Supervisors are responsible for
ensuring the SOP remains aligned with the latest clinical and
laboratory standards.
