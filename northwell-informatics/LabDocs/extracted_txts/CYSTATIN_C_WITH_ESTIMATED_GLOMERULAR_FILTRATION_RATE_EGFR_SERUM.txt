STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP) FOR ANALYTICAL
PHASE OF GENERATING RESULTS FOR CYSTATIN C WITH
ESTIMATED GLOMERULAR FILTRATION RATE (eGFR), SERUM
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to provide detailed instructions for the
analytical phase of generating results for Cystatin C with Estimated
Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR), serum. The procedure ensures
accurate and reliable results interpretation, enabling effective patient
diagnostics and treatment.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all trained laboratory personnel to follow this
SOP as instructed. The laboratory supervisor is responsible for
ensuring the SOP is followed and that all personnel are properly
trained.
1. SPECIMEN
Acceptable Specimen:
• Serum samples collected in SST (Serum Separator Tubes)
• Collected and centrifuged within 2 hours of collection
• Store at 2-8°C if not analyzed immediately
• Stable for up to 7 days at 2-8°C
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Hemolyzed samples
• Specimens collected in non-SST tubes
• Specimens not stored or handled as described
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Automated clinical chemistry analyzer (e.g., Roche Cobas,
Beckman Coulter AU)
• Calibrators and controls specific for Cystatin C (provided by the
reagent manufacturer)
• Reagent kits for Cystatin C analysis
• eGFR calculation tools/software as per laboratory standard
1. PROCEDURE
A. Pre-analytical Preparation
1. Verify that the specimen is labeled correctly with patient
identification and matches the test requisition.
2. Inspect the sample for hemolysis or other acceptability criteria.
3. Ensure that the sample is at room temperature before analysis
by allowing refrigerated specimens to sit for 30 minutes at room
temperature.
B. Instrument Preparation
1. Perform instrument maintenance and calibration as per the
manufacturer's guidelines.
2. Load the appropriate Cystatin C reagent packs and calibrators
onto the chemistry analyzer.
C. Running the Assay
1. Program the clinical chemistry analyzer for Cystatin C testing,
following the manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Load the patient specimens, quality control material, and
calibrators onto the analyzer.
3. Initiate the analysis sequence on the instrument.
4. Verify that quality control results are within the acceptable
range before proceeding with patient sample analysis. If QC
fails, troubleshoot per manufacturer's guidelines and only
proceed once QC results are acceptable.
D. Calculating eGFR
1. Once the Cystatin C results are obtained, use the validated
laboratory software or calculation tool to determine the eGFR.
2. The equation for eGFR based on Cystatin C is automatically
applied by the software. Manually, it can be calculated using the
following equation: eGFR (mL/min/1.73 m²) = 133.9 * (Cystatin
C^(-1.328)) * (0.996^Age) * (0.932 if female)
E. Result Validation
1. Compare the individual results with established reference
ranges and patient history (if available).
2. Verify and validate results ensuring that all controls and
calibrators were within range during the run.
3. Release results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
4. Flag any results that are deemed critical or outside the
established reference range for immediate review by a
supervising technologist or clinician.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
• Conduct and document daily instrument calibration and
maintenance.
• Analyze at least two levels of quality control materials every 24
hours of operation.
• Review and document QC results; initiate corrective actions if
controls fall outside acceptable limits.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
2. Results are automatically transmitted and stored in the
Laboratory Information System (LIS).
3. Ensure that eGFR results are included alongside Cystatin C
determinations.
4. Notify the requesting clinician promptly for any critical values as
defined by the laboratory’s critical value policy.
5. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples may interfere with the
assay results and must be handled per manufacturer instructions.
• Patient-specific factors such as age, body mass, and health
conditions should be considered when interpreting eGFR.
