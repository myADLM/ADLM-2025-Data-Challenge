Standard Operating Procedure for Cysticercosis Serology,
Serum
1. PURPOSE
This procedure is designed to provide detailed instructions for the
analytical phase of generating results for Cysticercosis Serology from
serum samples. The objective is to ensure accurate and consistent
results through standard protocols and quality control measures.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the
Cysticercosis Serology tests as outlined in this SOP.
• Laboratory supervisors must ensure compliance with this SOP
and address any technical issues or deviations from protocol.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred Specimen:
• 5 mL of serum collected in a serum separator tube (SST) or a
plain red-top tube.
• Serum should be separated from cells within 2 hours of collection.
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
• Specimens collected in anticoagulant tubes (e.g., EDTA, heparin,
citrate).
• Specimens with no collection date/time indicated.
Stability:
• Serum samples are stable for up to 48 hours at 2-8°C.
• For longer storage, freeze samples at -20°C or lower.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Cysticercosis antibody detection kit (e.g., ELISA or immunoblot
specific for Cysticercosis).
• Microplate reader (for ELISA).
• Pipettes and pipette tips.
• Calibrated timers.
• Deionized or distilled water.
• Plate washer.
• Incubator set to 37°C.
• Safety equipment including gloves, lab coats, and eye protection.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
Internal Quality Control:
• Run positive and negative controls with each batch of patient
samples.
• Verify that the optical density (OD) values of controls fall within
the manufacturer's specified ranges.
• Document all quality control results.
External Quality Control:
• Participate in an external quality assessment program (e.g.,
proficiency testing) to ensure ongoing accuracy and reliability.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation of Reagents:
• Prepare all reagents according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
• Bring all reagents, samples, and controls to room temperature
before use.
B. Assay Procedure (Example for ELISA):
1. Add 100 µL of each patient sample, positive control, negative
control, and blank (deionized water) to designated wells on the
microplate.
2. Incubate the plate at 37°C for 30 minutes.
3. Wash the wells 3-5 times with the provided wash buffer.
4. Add 100 µL of enzyme conjugate to each well.
5. Incubate the plate at 37°C for 30 minutes.
6. Wash the wells 3-5 times with the provided wash buffer.
7. Add 100 µL of substrate solution to each well.
8. Incubate the plate in the dark at room temperature for 10-15
minutes (or as specified by the manufacturer).
9. Add 50 µL of stop solution to each well to stop the reaction.
10. Read the plate at the appropriate wavelength using a
microplate reader.
C. Calculation of Results:
• Calculate the results according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
• Express results as positive, indeterminate, or negative based on
the interpretation criteria provided.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Transmit results to the Laboratory Information System (LIS) for
review and verification by a designated technologist.
• Report results as either positive, indeterminate, or negative.
• Indeterminates should be re-tested or confirmed with an alternate
method.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If quality control results fall outside acceptable ranges, do not
report patient results. Repeat the assay after resolving the issue.
• Common issues include improper washing, timing errors, and
temperature inconsistencies. Refer to the kit insert for
troubleshooting tips.
1. SAMPLE INTEGRITY AND STORAGE
• Retain all positive samples at -20°C for potential re-testing or
confirmatory testing.
• Dispose of all biological waste and sharps according to biohazard
disposal protocols.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions for the cysticercosis antibody
detection kit.
• Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines.
• External quality assessment program documentation (e.g.,
College of American Pathologists (CAP) proficiency testing).
1. DOCUMENTATION
• Maintain records of all test results, including quality control data,
for a minimum of two years.
• Document all deviations from standard protocol and corrective
actions taken.
By following these detailed procedures, the laboratory ensures the
accuracy and reliability of Cysticercosis Serology testing, thereby
providing valuable diagnostic information for patient care.
