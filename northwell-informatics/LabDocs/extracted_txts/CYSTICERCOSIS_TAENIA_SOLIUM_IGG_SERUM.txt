Standard Operating Procedure for Cysticercosis (Taenia solium),
IgG, Serum
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this SOP is to outline the analytical
procedure for the detection of Cysticercosis (Taenia solium) IgG
antibodies in serum samples. This procedure will ensure accurate
and consistent results are generated in compliance with CLIA
standards.
2. SCOPE This procedure applies to the testing of serum samples for
the presence of IgG antibodies against Taenia solium using an
Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA).
3. RESPONSIBILITY It is the responsibility of laboratory
technologists to perform this test according to the procedures
detailed below. The laboratory supervisor will ensure all staff
members are adequately trained and the laboratory is equipped with
necessary resources.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred/acceptable: 5 mL of serum collected in a red-top or
serum separator tube (SST).
• Unacceptable: Specimens that are hemolyzed, lipemic, icteric,
contaminated, or otherwise compromised.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• ELISA microplate reader and washer
• Cysticercosis (Taenia solium) IgG ELISA kit, including:
◦ Microplate coated with Taenia solium antigen
◦ Washing buffer
◦ Sample diluent
◦ Conjugate (enzyme-labeled anti-human IgG)
◦ Substrate solution (e.g., TMB)
◦ Stop solution (e.g., sulfuric acid)
◦ Positive and negative controls
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Plate sealer
• Timer
• Lab coat, gloves, and other appropriate personal protective
equipment (PPE)
6. PROCEDURE A. Preparation 1. Allow all reagents and specimens
to come to room temperature (20-25°C) before use. 2. Set up the
ELISA reader and washer according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
B. Sample and Control Preparation 1. Dilute serum specimens 1:100
in sample diluent. 2. Prepare positive and negative controls as per
ELISA kit instructions.
C. Assay Procedure 1. Add 100 µL of diluted samples, positive
control, and negative control to the respective wells of the antigen-
coated microplate. 2. Cover the plate with a plate sealer and incubate
for 30 minutes at 37°C. 3. Wash the plate 5 times with washing
buffer, ensuring complete removal of liquid after each wash. 4. Add
100 µL of enzyme-labeled anti-human IgG conjugate to each well. 5.
Cover the plate with a new plate sealer and incubate for 30 minutes
at 37°C. 6. Wash the plate 5 times with washing buffer. 7. Add 100 µL
of substrate solution to each well. 8. Incubate the plate in the dark at
room temperature for 15 minutes. 9. Add 100 µL of stop solution to
each well to stop the reaction.
D. Reading and Interpretation 1. Read the optical density (OD) of
each well at the wavelength specified by the kit (often 450 nm with a
reference wavelength of 620-650 nm) using the ELISA microplate
reader. 2. Calculate the results as per the kit instructions. The OD
values of the positive, negative, and sample wells will determine the
presence of Taenia solium IgG antibodies in the samples.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run positive and negative controls with each batch of tests to
validate the assay.
• If the controls do not perform as expected, repeat the assay or
troubleshoot as necessary, and do not report any patient results.
• Document all control results and any corrective actions taken.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results should be reported as positive or negative based on the
calculated cut-off value provided in the ELISA kit instructions.
• Any samples with OD values above the cut-off should be reported
as positive for Cysticercosis (Taenia solium) IgG antibodies.
Samples with OD values below the cut-off should be reported as
negative.
9. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Positive: Indicates the presence of IgG antibodies to Taenia
solium.
• Negative: Indicates the absence of IgG antibodies to Taenia
solium.
10. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Cross-reactivity with other parasitic infections can occur. A
positive result should be confirmed with clinical correlation and
additional testing as appropriate.
• A negative result does not completely rule out the possibility of
cysticercosis infection, particularly in immunocompromised
patients.
11. REFERENCES
• ELISA kit package insert and manufacturer’s instructions.
• Relevant clinical laboratory guidelines and protocols.
12. MAINTENANCE AND CALIBRATION
• Perform regular maintenance and calibration of the ELISA
microplate reader and washer according to the manufacturer's
schedule and recommendations.
• Keep records of all maintenance and calibration activities.
13. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS
• Handle all specimens and reagents with care, following standard
biosafety guidelines.
• Wear appropriate PPE throughout the procedure.
This protocol serves to ensure the reliable detection of Cysticercosis
(Taenia solium) IgG antibodies in serum, maintaining accuracy and
consistency across all testing cycles.
