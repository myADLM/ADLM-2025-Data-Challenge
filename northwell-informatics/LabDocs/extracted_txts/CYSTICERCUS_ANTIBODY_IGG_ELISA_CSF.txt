Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Cysticercus Antibody
(IgG), ELISA in CSF
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the detection of Cysticercus
Antibody (IgG) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) specimens using ELISA
(Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay).
1. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory personnel trained in ELISA techniques are
responsible for performing and documenting the procedure.
Supervisors are responsible for ensuring that the procedure is carried
out correctly.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• ELISA microplate reader
• ELISA microplate washer
• Incubator (37°C)
• Micropipettes and pipette tips
• Multichannel pipette
• Timer
• Vortex mixer
• Disposable gloves and lab coat
Reagents:
• Cysticercus Antigen-coated ELISA plate
• CSF samples (properly collected and stored)
• Positive and negative controls
• Wash buffer (PBS with Tween-20)
• Blocking buffer
• Sample diluent
• Enzyme conjugate (Anti-human IgG HRP conjugate)
• Substrate solution (TMB)
• Stop solution (Hydrochloric or sulfuric acid)
Supplies:
• Reagent reservoirs
• Disposable ELISA plates
• Absorbent paper towels
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
• Specimen Type: CSF collected in a sterile container
• Volume Required: Minimum of 1 mL
• Stability: Samples must be stored at 2-8°C and tested within 48
hours or frozen at -20°C for longer storage.
1. PROCEDURE
Step A: Preparation
1. Ensure all reagents and samples are at room temperature
before starting the assay.
2. Label the ELISA plate with sample identifiers.
3. Prepare wash buffer, blocking buffer, and sample diluent
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Step B: Sample and Control Preparation
1. Dilute CSF samples 1:100 in sample diluent.
2. Prepare positive and negative controls as instructed by the
manufacturer.
Step C: ELISA Assay
1. Antigen Coating (if not pre-coated):
◦ Coat ELISA plates with Cysticercus Antigen, and incubate
overnight at 4°C.
◦ Wash the plate 3 times with wash buffer.
◦ Block non-specific sites with blocking buffer and incubate for
1 hour at 37°C.
◦ Wash the plate 3 times with wash buffer.
2. Sample and Control Addition:
◦ Add 100 μL of diluted CSF samples, positive control, and
negative control to respective wells.
◦ Incubate the plate for 1 hour at 37°C.
◦ Wash the plate 5 times with wash buffer.
3. Enzyme Conjugate Addition:
◦ Add 100 μL of enzyme conjugate to each well.
◦ Incubate the plate for 30 minutes at 37°C.
◦ Wash the plate 5 times with wash buffer.
4. Substrate Addition:
◦ Add 100 μL of TMB substrate solution to each well.
◦ Incubate the plate in the dark for 15 minutes at room
temperature.
5. Stop Reaction:
◦ Add 100 μL of stop solution to each well to stop the
enzymatic reaction.
6. Reading the Results:
◦ Measure the absorbance at 450 nm using an ELISA
microplate reader.
7. DATA ANALYSIS
8. Calculate the average optical density (OD) of the positive and
negative controls.
9. Determine the cut-off value as per the manufacturer's
instructions.
10. Compare sample OD values to the cut-off value to determine
the presence or absence of Cysticercus Antibody (IgG).
Interpretation:
◦ OD value greater than or equal to the cut-off: Positive for
Cysticercus Antibody (IgG)
◦ OD value less than the cut-off: Negative for Cysticercus
Antibody (IgG)
11. QUALITY CONTROL
12. Run positive and negative controls with each assay to validate
the performance.
13. Ensure quality control samples fall within established ranges.
14. REPORTING RESULTS
15. Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
16. Review and verify results before reporting.
17. Include control validation results with the patient results.

19. Manufacturer's instructions for the Cysticercus Antigen ELISA
kit.
20. Relevant laboratory SOPs and guidelines.
21. ADDITIONAL NOTES
22. Ensure all waste is disposed of according to biohazard
regulations.
23. Maintain records of all assay details, including lot numbers of
reagents, dates, and personnel performing the test.
By following this SOP, laboratory personnel will ensure consistent
and accurate detection of Cysticercus Antibody (IgG) in CSF
samples, contributing to high-quality patient care.
