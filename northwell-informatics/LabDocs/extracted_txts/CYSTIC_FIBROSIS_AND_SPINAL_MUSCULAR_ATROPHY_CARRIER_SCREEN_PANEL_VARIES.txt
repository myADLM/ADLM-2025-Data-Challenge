Cystic Fibrosis and Spinal Muscular Atrophy Carrier Screen
Panel, Varies - Standard Operating Procedure
1. PURPOSE
To ensure accurate and reliable generation of results for the Cystic
Fibrosis (CF) and Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) Carrier Screen
Panel. This SOP outlines the steps to be followed in the analytical
phase, from the preparation of specimens to data analysis and result
generation.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all CF and SMA carrier screen tests
performed in the laboratory using specimens such as blood, saliva, or
buccal swabs.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing the
CF and SMA Carrier Screen tests, analyzing the results accurately,
and maintaining quality control according to this procedure.
4. PROCEDURE
4.1 Specimen Preparation
• Ensure that the specimen has been properly collected, received,
and accessioned.
• Specimens can include blood (EDTA tubes), saliva, or buccal
swabs. Verify that specimens are appropriately labeled and stored
before testing.
4.2 Reagents and Equipment
• CFTR and SMN1 mutation detection reagents and kits, as per
manufacturer’s instructions
• Thermal cycler for PCR amplification
• Capillary electrophoresis system or next-generation sequencing
(NGS) platform for mutation detection
• Standard laboratory reagents and disposables (pipettes, tips,
tubes, etc.)
• Quality control material (positive and negative controls)
4.3 Assay Methodology
4.3.1 PCR Amplification
1. DNA Extraction: Extract DNA from the specimen using a
standardized DNA extraction kit. Follow the manufacturer’s
protocol for efficient lysis and purification.
2. Quantification and Quality Assessment: Quantify and assess
the quality of extracted DNA by spectrophotometry and gel
electrophoresis.
3. PCR Setup:
◦ Prepare the PCR reaction mix as instructed by the
manufacturer, including primers specific for CFTR and
SMN1 genes.
◦ Add DNA template to the PCR mix.
◦ Load the PCR tubes into the thermal cycler and run the
PCR program (thermal cycling conditions should adhere to
the manufacturer's recommendations).
4.3.2 Mutation Detection
1. Capillary Electrophoresis or NGS:
◦ For Capillary Electrophoresis: Utilize the capillary
electrophoresis system to separate and detect amplified
products.
◦ For NGS: Prepare libraries according to the NGS platform’s
manual. Load the libraries onto the sequencer and initiate
the run.
2. Analysis:
◦ Utilize the software provided by the equipment manufacturer
to analyze the results.
◦ Interpret the data based on known mutation databases and
guidelines for CF and SMA.
4.4 Quality Control
• Positive and Negative Controls: Include positive and negative
controls in each run to verify assay validity.
• Repeat Tests: If controls fail to give expected results or if there is
a discrepancy in findings, repeat the test.
• Documentation: Record all QC results in the QC log. Any
anomalies and corrective actions taken should be documented.
4.5 Data Analysis and Interpretation
1. Data Review: Review the raw data for each specimen. Confirm
the presence or absence of CFTR and SMN1 mutations.
2. Result Interpretation:
◦ Positive: Identify mutations in the CFTR gene (cystic
fibrosis) or deletions in the SMN1 gene (spinal muscular
atrophy).
◦ Negative: No detectable mutations or deletions in the CFTR
or SMN1 genes.
3. Documentation:
◦ Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
◦ Ensure that the interpretation aligns with clinical guidelines.
4.6 Reporting Results
1. Validation: Validate the results by a senior technologist or
supervisor.
2. Result Reporting: Generate a result report that includes the
patient identification, test performed, result (mutation detected
or not detected), and any pertinent comments.
3. Communication: Results should be communicated to the
ordering physician following the laboratory’s standard reporting
protocols.
4.7 Troubleshooting
• Inconclusive or Aberrant Results: Investigate and resolve any
issues that may cause ambiguous or inconsistent results. This
may involve re-extraction, re-amplification, or re-analysis.
