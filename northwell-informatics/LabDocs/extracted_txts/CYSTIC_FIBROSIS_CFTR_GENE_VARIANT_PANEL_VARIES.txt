Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) for Cystic Fibrosis, CFTR
Gene, Variant Panel Analysis
1. PURPOSE
To provide standardized procedures for the detection of specific
variants in the CFTR gene to aid in the diagnosis of Cystic Fibrosis
(CF).
Responsibility:
Qualified laboratory personnel are responsible for performing and
documenting all steps of the CFTR variant panel analysis. Laboratory
supervisors are responsible for ensuring the accuracy and reliability
of test results.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/Acceptable:
• 3-5 mL whole blood in EDTA or ACD tube
• Buccal swabs or saliva samples can be accepted in specific
collection kits as indicated.
Unacceptable:
• Hemolyzed, clotted, or improperly collected samples.
• Samples without proper labeling or documentation.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Thermocyclers (PCR machines)
• CFTR gene-specific primers
• PCR reagents (dNTPs, Taq polymerase, buffers, etc.)
• Agarose gel electrophoresis apparatus
• Reagents for Sanger sequencing or next-generation sequencing
(NGS) as applicable
• DNA extraction kits
• Positive and negative control DNA samples
• Appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE)
• Pipettes and sterile pipette tips
• Microcentrifuge tubes
• Sterile gloves
• Laboratory notebook or electronic documentation system
4. PROCEDURE
A) DNA Extraction:
1. Extract DNA from whole blood using a commercial DNA
extraction kit following the manufacturer's instructions.
2. If using buccal swabs or saliva, follow the specific protocol for
DNA extraction from these sources as per kit instructions.
3. Quantify the extracted DNA using a spectrophotometer and
record the concentration and purity (A260/A280 ratio).
B) PCR Amplification:
1. Prepare the PCR reaction mix including primers specific to the
CFTR gene variants, DNA template, dNTPs, Taq polymerase,
and buffers as per the optimized protocol.
2. Set up the thermocycler according to the cycling conditions
specified for CFTR variant detection.
3. Load the PCR tubes into the thermocycler and initiate the run.
4. Verify PCR amplification by running an aliquot of the product on
an agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide or another
suitable DNA stain.
C) Variant Detection:
Option 1: Sanger Sequencing
1. Purify PCR products using a PCR purification kit or enzymatic
cleanup method.
2. Prepare sequencing reactions using purified PCR products,
sequencing primers, and sequencing reagents.
3. Run the sequencing reactions on a sequencer following the
manufacturer's guidelines.
4. Analyze the sequencing data using appropriate software to
identify CFTR gene variants.
Option 2: Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS)
1. Prepare DNA libraries according to the NGS kit manufacturer's
instructions.
2. Quantify and normalize library preparations before sequencing.
3. Load the prepared libraries onto the NGS platform and start the
sequencing run.
4. Analyze sequencing data using bioinformatics tools to identify
CFTR gene variants.
D) Result Interpretation and Reporting:
1. Compare identified variants to a reference sequence to confirm
their presence and correct any potential sequencing errors.
2. Use a validated database to interpret the clinical significance of
identified variants.
3. Document the variant analysis results in the laboratory
information system.
4. Prepare a report including the identified CFTR variants, their
clinical significance, and any recommendations for further
action.
5. Have the report reviewed and signed by a qualified laboratory
director or designee.
5. QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE
1. Run positive and negative controls with each batch of tests to
ensure the accuracy of results.
2. Perform regular maintenance and calibration of all equipment
used in the analysis.
3. Participate in external quality assessment (EQA) schemes to
benchmark performance.
4. Document all steps of the procedure including any deviations
and corrective actions taken.
6. LIMITATIONS AND REFERENCES
Method Limitations: Refer to CFTR variant panel instructions and
sequencing kit manuals for specific limitations regarding detection
sensitivity and specificity.
