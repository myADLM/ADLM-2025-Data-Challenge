CFTR Full Gene Analysis Protocol
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the full gene analysis of the
Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR)
gene, which spans 27 exons and includes common and rare
mutations associated with Cystic Fibrosis. This procedure ensures
the accurate identification and reporting of genetic variants to
facilitate diagnosis and management of patients with suspected or
confirmed Cystic Fibrosis.
Responsibility:
• Molecular Laboratory Staff: Execute the CFTR gene analysis
procedures in compliance with this SOP.
• Laboratory Supervisors: Validate results and address any
deviations from protocol.
1. SPECIMEN
Specimen Type:
• Preferred: Whole blood collected in EDTA (purple-top) tubes.
• Acceptable: Saliva or buccal swab samples.
Specimen Stability:
• Store whole blood specimens at 2-8°C for up to 7 days.
• Saliva/buccal swabs may be stored at room temperature up to 14
days.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens not labeled with proper patient identification.
• Specimens with insufficient volume or multiple freeze-thaw cycles.
• Specimens collected using incorrect anticoagulants (e.g.,
heparinized tubes).
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• PCR thermocycler
• Sequencing machine (e.g., Next-Generation Sequencer or
Sanger Sequencer)
• CFTR primer sets covering all 27 exons
• PCR reagents: dNTPs, MgCl2, Taq polymerase, buffers
• Sequencing kits and reagents
• Nucleic acid extraction kits and reagents
• Software for sequence alignment and variant annotation
1. PROCEDURE
Nucleic Acid Extraction:
1. Extract genomic DNA from 3-5 mL of whole blood or suitable
quantity from saliva/buccal swab using a commercial extraction
kit following the manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Quantify and assess the quality of DNA using
spectrophotometry (e.g., NanoDrop) and electrophoresis.
PCR Amplification:
1. Perform PCR amplification of all 27 exons of the CFTR gene
using specific primer sets.
2. Prepare PCR mixture containing DNA template, primers,
dNTPs, MgCl2, Taq polymerase, and buffer.
3. Cycle conditions: Initial denaturation at 95°C for 5 minutes,
followed by 30 cycles of denaturation at 95°C for 30 seconds,
annealing at optimized temperature for 30 seconds, and
extension at 72°C for 45 seconds, with a final extension at 72°C
for 7 minutes.
4. Confirm amplification success by running PCR products on
agarose gel electrophoresis.
Sequencing:
1. Purify PCR products using a commercial purification kit.
2. Perform sequencing using a sequencer following the
manufacturer’s instructions.
3. Use sequence alignment software to compare obtained
sequences with the reference CFTR gene sequence.
4. Identify and annotate variants present in the sequences.
Variant Interpretation:
1. Classify identified variants based on known pathogenicity using
databases such as ClinVar, CFTR2, and published literature.
2. Confirm the presence of pathogenic variants by reviewing
sequence chromatograms and running secondary confirmatory
tests if necessary.
3. Document findings in the patient record, including annotations
and clinical significance.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include positive and negative controls in every PCR and
sequencing run.
• Validate new batches of primers and reagents per laboratory
quality control procedures.
• Regularly calibrate equipment according to manufacturer
guidelines and document.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results are automatically transmitted to the Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
• Molecular Laboratory Staff review sequences and variant
annotations.
• Laboratory Supervisors verify and sign off on the final report.
• Release results to ordering physician and incorporate findings into
patient health records according to site-specific reporting
guidelines.
Critical Results:
• Immediately notify the physician if pathogenic variants associated
with severe Cystic Fibrosis are identified.
1. STORAGE OF SPECIMENS AND DATA
• Store extracted DNA at -20°C for up to 1 year.
• Store annotated sequencing data and reports in the LIS for future
reference.
