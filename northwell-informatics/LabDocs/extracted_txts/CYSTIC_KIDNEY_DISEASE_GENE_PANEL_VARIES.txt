1. PURPOSE The purpose of this procedure is to provide a
standardized protocol for the analytical phase of generating
results for the Cystic Kidney Disease Gene Panel. This panel
involves testing the presence of genetic variations associated
with cystic kidney diseases using next-generation sequencing
(NGS) techniques.
2. SCOPE This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel
involved in the analytical processing of the Cystic Kidney
Disease Gene Panel after the receipt and accessioning of
specimens.
3. RESPONSIBILITIES
• Laboratory Technologists: Perform the analytical procedures as
outlined and ensure all quality control measures are followed.
• Laboratory Supervisors: Provide oversight, troubleshoot issues,
and verify final results.
1. PRINCIPLE The Cystic Kidney Disease Gene Panel uses next-
generation sequencing (NGS) technology to identify mutations
in genes associated with cystic kidney diseases. This involves
DNA extraction, library preparation, sequencing, data analysis,
and interpretation.
2. MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT
• DNA Extraction Kit
• Quantification instruments (e.g., Qubit Fluorometer, NanoDrop)
• Library Preparation Kit
• NGS Platform (e.g., Illumina, Thermo Fisher)
• Bioinformatics software and tools
• Quality control reagents and standards (e.g., DNA ladders,
positive controls)
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS Preferred Specimen:
• 3 ml of whole blood in an EDTA tube
• Alternatively, 1-2 ml of saliva in a DNA preservation kit.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens not labeled correctly.
• Specimens received in non-appropriate containers, e.g., heparin
tubes.
• Samples that have been improperly stored or damaged.
1. PROCEDURE 7.1. DNA Extraction
2. Extract DNA from the received specimens using the appropriate
DNA extraction kit.
3. Quantify the extracted DNA using Qubit Fluorometer and
assess the purity with NanoDrop.
4. Document the DNA concentration and purity for further
processing.
7.2. Library Preparation
1. Prepare DNA libraries using the library preparation kit according
to the manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Perform quality control checks on prepared libraries, including
size determination and quantification.
3. Pool libraries to achieve the input requirements for the NGS
platform.
7.3. Sequencing
1. Load the pooled libraries onto the NGS platform as per the
manufacturer's guidelines.
2. Set up the sequencing run parameters specific for the Cystic
Kidney Disease Gene Panel.
3. Monitor the sequencing run and ensure all steps are performed
smoothly and documented.
7.4. Data Analysis
1. Perform initial data analysis using the provided bioinformatics
software.
2. Review the data output for quality metrics including coverage
depth, base quality scores and alignment efficiency.
3. Annotate identified variants with known databases to determine
clinical relevance.
7.5. Interpretation and Reporting
1. Interpret the genetic variants according to established
guidelines (e.g., ACMG).
2. Generate a comprehensive report including identified
mutations, their potential impacts, and any recommended
follow-up testing or clinical actions.
3. Ensure all results are reviewed by a qualified medical
professional before reporting to the clinician.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
5. Include positive and negative controls in every DNA extraction
and library preparation run.
6. Perform routine instrument calibrations and maintenance
checks as per the manufacturer’s recommendations.
7. Participate in external quality assurance programs relevant to
genetic testing.
8. TROUBLESHOOTING
• DNA Yield or Quality Issues: Re-extract the DNA from the same
specimen or request a new specimen.
• Library Preparation Failures: Repeat library preparation and
reassess quality.
• Sequencing Failures: Investigate the cause (e.g., reagent issues,
instrument malfunction), resolve, and repeat the sequencing run.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s manuals for DNA extraction, library preparation
kits, and NGS platforms.
• ACMG Guidelines for the interpretation of sequencing results.
• Standard laboratory practices and protocols.
1. DOCUMENTATION Ensure all steps from DNA extraction to
reporting are adequately documented, including initial
concentrations, quality control results, sequencing metrics, and
variant interpretations. Maintain records in compliance with
regulatory and accreditation requirements.
