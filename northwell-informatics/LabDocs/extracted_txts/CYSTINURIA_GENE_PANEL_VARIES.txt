Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase for Generating Results for Cystinuria Gene
Panel, Varies
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the procedures to be followed during the analytical
phase for generating results from the Cystinuria Gene Panel, Varies.
It ensures accuracy, consistency, and reproducibility of the genetic
analysis involved in diagnosing cystinuria.
2. SCOPE
This protocol applies to laboratory personnel performing the
analytical phase of the Cystinuria Gene Panel, encompassing sample
preparation, sequencing, data analysis, and result generation.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory personnel trained in the specific techniques
required for genetic analysis are responsible for performing and
documenting the procedures outlined herein. It is the responsibility of
all staff to identify any discrepancies in the process and report them
to a supervisor.
4. DEFINITIONS
• Cystinuria: A genetic disorder that results in the excessive
excretion of the amino acid cystine into the urine, forming cystine
stones.
• Gene Panel: A targeted sequencing approach focusing on
specific genes known to be associated with cystinuria.
5. EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS
• Thermocycler for PCR
• Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) platform
• Agilent 2200 TapeStation or similar for library quality control
• DNA Extraction Kit
• Library Preparation Kit
• Sequencing Reagents
• Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS)
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
6. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
• Specimen Type: Whole blood, saliva, or buccal swab
• Volume: Minimum 3 mL of whole blood or saliva, or two buccal
swabs
• Storage: Store whole blood at 2-8°C for up to 48 hours. Saliva
and buccal swabs can be stored at room temperature if
processed within the manufacturer's specifications.
7. PROCEDURE
A) DNA Extraction:
1. Label Samples: Ensure all samples are correctly labeled and
documented in LIMS.
2. Extraction: Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for DNA
extraction using the designated DNA Extraction Kit.
3. Quantification: Measure DNA concentration using a
spectrophotometer or fluorometer.
4. Quality Check: Assess DNA purity using A260/A280 ratio and
ensure it is within acceptable range (1.8-2.0).
B) Library Preparation and QC:
1. Library Preparation:
◦ Follow the Library Preparation Kit instructions to prepare
DNA libraries from extracted DNA.
◦ Perform PCR amplification when necessary.
◦ Quantify the DNA libraries using the Agilent 2200
TapeStation or similar instrument.
2. Quality Control:
◦ Check the integrity and size distribution of the libraries.
◦ Ensure library concentration meets the sequencing
platform’s requirements.
C) Sequencing:
1. Setup: Load the prepared libraries onto the NGS platform
according to the manufacturer's instructions.
2. Run Sequencing: Initiate the sequencing run and monitor its
progress.
3. Data Transfer: Upon completion, transfer the raw sequencing
data to the designated bioinformatics team or server for
analysis.
D) Data Analysis:
1. Alignment and Quality Control:
◦ Utilize bioinformatics software to align sequencing reads to
the reference genome.
◦ Evaluate sequencing depth, coverage, and quality metrics.
2. Variant Calling and Annotation:
◦ Perform variant calling using validated software tools.
◦ Annotate the identified variants with pertinent databases to
predict their significance.
3. Interpretation:
◦ Review the annotated variants for clinical relevance to
cystinuria.
◦ Generate a preliminary report including identified variants
and their potential impact.
E) Report Generation and Review:
1. Draft Report:
◦ Draft the genetic analysis report containing detailed findings
and interpretations.
◦ Include any potential recommendations for further actions or
investigations.
2. Peer Review:
◦ Have the report reviewed by a secondary qualified
laboratory scientist or geneticist.
◦ Ensure all discrepancies or ambiguous results are resolved
prior to finalizing the report.
3. Approval and Release:
◦ Obtain final approval from the designated supervisor or
laboratory director.
◦ Release the approved report to the requesting clinician or
medical professional.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
• Implement routine quality control checks at various stages of the
analysis to ensure data integrity and accuracy.
• Perform regular calibration and maintenance of equipment used
in the process.
• Document all procedural deviations and corrective actions taken.
9. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions for DNA Extraction Kit, Library
Preparation Kit, and Sequencing Platform.
• LIMS documentation for specimen tracking and data
management.
• Relevant scientific literature on cystinuria and related genetic
analysis techniques.
10. ATTACHMENTS
• Standard form for documenting DNA extraction quality.
• Template for the genetic analysis report.
• Equipment calibration and maintenance log.
11. REVISION HISTORY
• Document revision history and dates of updates.
This SOP shall be reviewed and revised periodically to incorporate
the latest advances in genetic testing and sequencing technology. All
personnel must adhere to this protocol to ensure the accuracy and
reliability of cystinuria genetic analysis.
