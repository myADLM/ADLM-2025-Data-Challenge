Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Title: Analytical Phase Protocol
for Generation of Results for CYSTINURIA PROFILE,
QUANTITATIVE, 24 HOUR, URINE
1. PURPOSE To outline the procedure for the quantitative analysis
of cystinuria profile in a 24-hour urine specimen to ensure
accurate and consistent results.
Responsibility: All trained laboratory personnel are responsible for
performing this procedure following the outlined steps. Laboratory
supervisors must ensure adherence to the procedure and proper
documentation of all results and observations.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND HANDLING Specimen
Type:
• 24-hour urine collection
• The patient must be instructed to collect urine for 24 hours in a
provided container with appropriate preservatives, if necessary.
• Total volume must be recorded.
Acceptable Specimens:
• Specimens must be collected in a clean, chemical-free container.
• Specimens should be stored at 2-8°C during collection and
transported to the lab as soon as possible after collection.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens not collected over exactly 24 hours.
• Specimens stored improperly or not refrigerated if required.
• Specimens that are contaminated or not properly labeled with
patient information, date, and time of collection.
1. REAGENTS AND EQUIPMENT
• Quantitative cysteine assay kit
• Deionized water
• Calibrated pipettes
• Urinary preservative (if required)
• Centrifuge
• Spectrophotometer or relevant analyzer
• Laboratory-grade beakers and containers
• Refrigerated storage (2-8°C)
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run quality control samples alongside patient specimens to
ensure assay accuracy.
• Use quality control materials specific to the cystinuria profile.
• Follow manufacturer instructions for calibrating equipment and
preparing solutions.
• Document quality control results and take corrective actions if
results fall outside of acceptable limits.
1. PROCEDURE A) Sample Preparation:
2. Measure and record the total volume of the 24-hour urine
collection.
3. Mix the urine collection thoroughly before aliquoting.
4. Transfer an appropriate aliquot to a clean, labeled container.
Ensure the aliquot volume is as specified in the assay kit
instructions.
5. If necessary, centrifuge the aliquot at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes
to remove any particulate matter.
B) Running the Assay:
1. Prepare reagents as per manufacturer instructions.
2. Prepare standard solutions for the calibration curve.
3. Add specific volumes of urine aliquots, standards, and quality
control samples to the reaction wells in the assay kit.
4. Follow the defined incubation time and temperature settings as
specified in the kit protocol.
5. Measure the absorbance or relevant signal using the
spectrophotometer or analyzer.
C) Calculations:
1. Construct a calibration curve using the absorbance/signal
readings from the standard solutions.
2. Use the calibration curve to quantify the cystine concentration
in the urine samples.
3. Calculate the 24-hour excretion of cystine based on the urine
concentration and the total volume collected:
◦ Cystine Excretion (mg/24 hrs) = Urine Cystine
Concentration (mg/L) * Total Urine Volume (L)
4. REPORTING RESULTS
• Enter results and units into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
• Review results for consistency and accuracy.
• Include comments for any abnormal findings or deviation from the
protocol.
• Critical results should be immediately communicated to the
ordering physician and documented accordingly.
• Ensure results are verified and released by a qualified
technologist or supervisor.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS AND CLINICAL INTERPRETATION
Refer to manufacturer's instructions for specific reference
intervals. Discuss abnormal values with appropriate medical
staff to determine clinical significance.
2. LIMITATIONS
• Hematuria and proteinuria might interfere with accurate
measurement.
• Ensure proper specimen collection to avoid false results.
