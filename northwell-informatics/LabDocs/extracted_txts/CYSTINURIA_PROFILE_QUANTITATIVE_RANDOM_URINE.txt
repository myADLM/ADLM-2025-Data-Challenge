Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) CYSTINURIA PROFILE,
QUANTITATIVE, RANDOM, URINE
1. PURPOSE
This protocol provides the procedures for generating quantitative
results for the Cystinuria Profile analysis in random urine samples.
Ensuring accurate and reliable results is crucial for the clinical
assessment and management of patients presenting with symptoms
associated with cystinuria.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory staff are responsible for
performing the procedure according to the SOP. It is the responsibility
of all staff to prepare, analyze, document, and review results,
identifying any issues or deficiencies that may affect test outcomes
and report these to the supervisor.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/acceptable: - Random urine sample collected in a clean,
leak-proof container. - Volume required: Minimum of 10mL. -
Specimens should be delivered to the laboratory to ensure minimal
degradation; ideally, samples are analyzed within 6 hours of
collection. - If specimens are refrigerated, they must be brought to
room temperature before analysis.
Unacceptable: - Specimens arriving in the laboratory more than 24
hours after collection. - Specimens in containers without proper
labeling including patient's name, date, and time of collection.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
◦ High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) system
or an equivalent sensitive analytical instrument.
◦ Cystinuria standard solutions.
◦ Quality control materials for cystine and related amino acids.
◦ Calibrated micropipettes.
◦ Centrifuge.
◦ Vortex mixer.
◦ Clean test tubes or suitable vials.
◦ Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) such as gloves and
lab coat.
◦ Urine preservative if using BD Vacutainer Urinalysis
Preservative Conical Urine tube.
2. PROCEDURE
Sample Preparation: 1. Perform a visual inspection of the sample to
ensure that it is free from particulate matter. 2. If necessary,
centrifuge the urine sample at 2000 rpm for 5 minutes to remove
cellular debris. 3. Mix the urine sample by gently vortexing for about
10 seconds.
Calibration and Quality Control: 1. Calibrate the HPLC system using
standard cystinuria solutions and ensure it is operating correctly
before each run. 2. Run a series of quality control standards
alongside patient samples to ensure system accuracy.
Analysis: 1. Aliquot 1mL of mixed urine sample into a clean test tube.
2. Add internal standard if required by the procedure. 3. Inject the
prepared urine sample into the HPLC system following manufacturer
guidelines. 4. Begin the analysis with appropriate method settings for
cystine separation and detection.
Data Review and Documentation: 1. Review chromatograms for each
sample to identify cystine peaks. 2. Compare peaks with standard
cystine solutions and quantify cystine levels in urine samples. 3.
Document the quantified cystine values in the laboratory information
system (LIS). 4. Verify all results for accuracy and consistency.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Run internal and external controls daily to validate the
system and reagents.
◦ If quality control tests fail, do not report patient results.
Investigate and resolve the issue before running further
samples.
2. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ Results are to be verified by the performing technologist and
transmitted to the LIS.
◦ Include reference intervals and any relevant comments
regarding sample integrity or analytical observations.
3. REFERENCE INTERVALS
◦ Refer to latest clinical guidelines or literature for cystine
reference intervals in random urine samples.
4. METHOD LIMITATIONS
◦ Ensure proper sample handling to avoid contamination.
◦ Results may be affected by improper storage or delayed
transport. Follow specimen requirements to minimize these
risks.

intervals.
This SOP should be reviewed and updated annually or when
significant changes to procedures or instrumentation occur.
