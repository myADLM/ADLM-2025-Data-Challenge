Cytochrome B5 Reductase Enzyme Activity, Blood - Analytical
Phase Protocol
1. PURPOSE
To ensure accurate and reliable measurement of cytochrome
B5 reductase enzyme activity in blood samples, utilizing
standardized procedures for sample handling, instrumentation
operation, and quality control checks.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND HANDLING
Specimen:
◦ Preferred: Fresh whole blood collected in an EDTA tube.
◦ Acceptable: Fresh whole blood collected in other
anticoagulant tubes such as heparin, provided timely
transport to lab.
◦ Volume: Minimum of 5 mL of whole blood.
◦ Stability: Specimens must be transported to the laboratory
within 2 hours of collection or stored at 2-8°C for up to 24
hours if immediate processing is not possible.
Unacceptable Specimens:
◦ Samples collected in coagulated tubes.
◦ Hemolysed samples.
◦ Samples received beyond 24 hours post-collection.
◦ Insufficient specimen volume.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
◦ Spectrophotometer capable of measuring absorbance at
specified wavelengths.
◦ Assay kit for cytochrome B5 reductase activity (e.g.,
commercially available cytochrome B5 reductase enzyme
activity assay kit).
◦ EDTA tubes for blood collection.
◦ Pipettes and tips.
◦ Calibrated centrifuge.
◦ Refrigerated centrifuge for plasma separation.
◦ Reagent-grade water and buffer solutions.
◦ Test tubes and microfuge tubes.
◦ Personal protective equipment (PPE) including gloves, lab
coat, and safety goggles.
4. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation:
1. Centrifuge blood sample at 1500 rpm for 10 minutes at
2-8°C to separate plasma.
2. Collect the plasma into properly labeled microfuge tubes.
3. Store plasma samples at 2-8°C if not immediately
processed.
B. Reagent Preparation:
1. Prepare the necessary reagents as per the
manufacturer's instructions in the assay kit.
2. Thaw reagents if previously frozen and ensure all are at
room temperature before use.
C. Assay Procedure:
1. Add appropriate volumes of sample plasma, substrate,
and buffer solution into reaction tubes as per assay kit
instructions.
2. Incubate the reaction mixture at recommended
temperature (e.g., 37°C) for the specified time duration.
3. Stop the reaction using stop solution provided in the kit.
4. Measure the absorbance at the recommended
wavelength using a spectrophotometer.
5. Calculate enzyme activity based on absorbance readings
and the calibration curve generated from standard
solutions.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Run and document positive and negative control samples
with each batch of specimens processed.
◦ Ensure all equipment, especially the spectrophotometer, is
calibrated and maintenance records are updated.
◦ Perform regular proficiency testing to verify the accuracy of
the assay.
◦ Document all QC results on the Quality Control Log.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ Review and verify results by comparing with established
reference intervals:
▪ Normal range for cytochrome B5 reductase activity may
vary; refer to assay kit instructions for specific reference
values.
◦ Results are to be entered into the Laboratory Information
System (LIS) and reviewed for accuracy before verification.
◦ Ensure critical values are reported promptly as per the
laboratory's standard critical value policy.
7. METHOD LIMITATIONS
◦ Assay performance might be affected by hemolysis or
improper sample handling.
◦ Reference intervals might differ based on patient population;
consult assay kit documentation for specifics.
