phase of generating results for CYTOCHROME P450 1A2 genotype,
which varies among individuals. This protocol ensures accurate and
reliable genotyping results that can inform clinical decision-making.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory staff are responsible for
following these procedures for the accurate and timely analysis of
CYTOCHROME P450 1A2 genotype. It is the responsibility of all staff
to identify and report any issues that may affect the accuracy of
laboratory test results and to adhere to corrective measures.
Supervisors are responsible for ensuring that the procedures are
followed and documented accordingly.
1. DEFINITION
CYTOCHROME P450 1A2 (CYP1A2) is a gene that encodes an
enzyme involved in the metabolism of various drugs and xenobiotics.
Genotype variations can influence an individual's drug metabolism
rates, affecting therapeutic efficacy and potential toxicity.

B. Sample Preparation:
1. Extract genomic DNA from the collected specimens using the
DNA Extraction Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions.
2. Quantify and assess the quality of the extracted DNA using a
spectrophotometer or fluorometer. The acceptable
concentration ranges are 20-100 ng/µL, with a 260/280 ratio of
1.8-2.0.
3. Prepare DNA samples for CYP1A2 genotyping.
C. PCR Amplification:
1. Prepare PCR reaction mix in a sterile, RNase/DNase-free
environment:
◦ Template DNA: 2 µL
◦ Forward Primer: 1 µL
◦ Reverse Primer: 1 µL
◦ dNTPs: 0.2 mM
◦ Taq Polymerase: 0.5 U
◦ PCR Buffer: 1X
◦ MgCl2: 1.5 mM
◦ Nuclease-Free Water: To a final volume of 25 µL
2. Set up the PCR thermocycler with the following conditions:
◦ Initial Denaturation: 95°C for 5 min
◦ Denaturation: 95°C for 30 sec
◦ Annealing: 55°C for 30 sec
◦ Extension: 72°C for 45 sec
◦ Final Extension: 72°C for 7 min
◦ Total Cycles: 35
3. Run the PCR amplification and store the amplified products at
4°C until further processing.
D. Gel Electrophoresis:
1. Prepare a 1.5% agarose gel with Ethidium Bromide or GelRed
stain.
2. Load PCR products along with DNA Ladder on the gel.
3. Run gel electrophoresis at 100 volts for 45 minutes.
4. Visualize amplified DNA bands under UV light using a UV
Transilluminator.
E. Real-Time PCR for Genotyping:
1. Prepare a Real-Time PCR reaction mix with the following
components:
◦ Template DNA: 2 µL
◦ Primers: Optimized concentration
◦ Real-Time PCR Mix: 1X
◦ Nuclease-Free Water: To a final volume of 25 µL
2. Load samples into Real-Time PCR plates and seal with
adhesive optical film.
3. Program the Real-Time PCR system according to the specific
cycling conditions recommended by the reagent manufacturer
and run the amplification.
4. Analyze the amplification curves and genotype specific to
CYP1A2 using the Real-Time PCR software.
F. Verification and Documentation:
1. Compare results with positive control and negative control to
ensure accuracy.
2. Document all results in the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
3. In case of abnormal results, repeat amplification and
genotyping procedure to confirm findings.
4. Verify results by an experienced technologist before reporting.
G. Reporting Results:
1. Results are entered into the LIS and reviewed for accuracy.
2. Verified results are sent to the physician and added to the
patient’s medical record, including any recommendations based
on the genotype findings.
Quality Control:
1. Include positive and negative controls in every run.
2. Periodically verify the performance of all equipment related to
PCR and Real-Time PCR.
3. Document all quality control checks and corrective actions.
