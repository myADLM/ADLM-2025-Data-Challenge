Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for CYTOCHROME P450 2B6 GENOTYPE,
VARIES
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedures for the analytical
phase of generating results for the Cytochrome P450 2B6 (CYP2B6)
Genotype. This procedure includes DNA extraction, PCR
amplification, and genotyping analysis utilizing validated
methodologies.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel involved in the analysis
of CYP2B6 genotyping in a CLIA-certified laboratory setting. It
assumes that the specimen has already been collected, received,
and accessioned.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory personnel to
perform these procedures accurately and to document all steps and
results appropriately. All deviations from the procedure, potential
errors, and unusual outcomes must be reported to the supervising
Laboratory Director.
4. DEFINITIONS
• CYP2B6: Cytochrome P450 2B6, an enzyme involved in the
metabolism of various drugs.
• PCR: Polymerase Chain Reaction, a technique used to amplify
specific DNA sequences.
• Genotype: The genetic constitution of an individual organism.
• LIS: Laboratory Information System.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• DNA extraction kit (validated for clinical use)
• Thermal cycler for PCR
• PCR reagents (primers specific for CYP2B6 gene regions, Taq
polymerase, dNTPs, buffer)
• Gel electrophoresis apparatus or alternative nucleic acid
visualization system
• Genotyping platform (e.g., sequencer, TaqMan assays,
pyrosequencer)
• Positive and negative control DNA samples
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Microcentrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Gloves and other personal protective equipment (PPE)
• Laboratory bench and sterile work area
6. PROCEDURE
A) DNA Extraction:
1. Starting Material:
◦ Use 200 µL of whole blood or a suitable amount of another
validated sample type.
2. Extraction Process:
◦ Follow the manufacturer’s protocol of the DNA extraction kit.
◦ Document the extraction date, time, and any deviations.
◦ Quantify and assess the purity (A260/A280 ratio) of
extracted DNA using a spectrophotometer.
B) PCR Amplification:
1. Preparation of PCR Reaction Mix:
◦ Thaw reagents on ice, mix gently.
◦ Prepare master mix according to the validated protocol,
including DNA template, primers, Taq polymerase, dNTPs,
and buffer.
◦ Aliquot master mix into PCR tubes/plates.
2. Thermal Cycling Conditions:
◦ Denaturation: 94°C for 2 minutes
◦ Amplification (30-35 cycles):
▪ Denaturation: 94°C for 30 seconds
▪ Annealing: 55-60°C (primer-specific) for 30 seconds
▪ Extension: 72°C for 1 minute
◦ Final Extension: 72°C for 10 minutes
◦ Hold: 4°C
3. Documentation:
◦ Record the lot numbers of reagents and the thermal cycler
used.
◦ Document the PCR conditions and any deviations from the
protocol.
C) Genotyping Analysis:
1. Detection Method (e.g., Sequencing, TaqMan Assay):
◦ Prepare samples according to the specific genotyping
platform’s protocol.
◦ Include positive and negative controls in each run.
2. Data Analysis:
◦ Run the samples on the genotyping platform.
◦ Analyze the results using validated software.
◦ Document the genotyping data, including control sample
results.
3. Quality Control:
◦ Assess the quality and reliability of the data.
◦ Confirm that control samples produced expected results.
◦ If discrepancies or issues arise, follow troubleshooting
procedures as outlined by the manufacturer or internal
protocols.
D) Reporting Results:
1. Data Entry:
◦ Enter validated results into the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
◦ Attach all relevant documentation, including batch records,
control results, and any deviations.
2. Review and Verification:
◦ Results are reviewed and verified by a qualified
technologist.
◦ Any anomalous results are to be evaluated and reconciled
before final reporting.
3. Communication:
◦ Provide results to the requesting clinician in accordance with
laboratory policies.
4. Archiving:
◦ Store all raw data, analytical documentation, and quality
control records as per laboratory compliance requirements.

8. REVISION HISTORY
• Documented revisions will be maintained in the laboratory’s
document control system, including descriptions of changes and
dates of implementation.
