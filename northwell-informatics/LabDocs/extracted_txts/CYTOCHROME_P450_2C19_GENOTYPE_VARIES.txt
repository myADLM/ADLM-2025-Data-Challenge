Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): CYTOCHROME P450 2C19
GENOTYPE
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedures for the analytical
phase of generating results for CYTOCHROME P450 2C19 genotype
in our CLIA-certified laboratory. This includes performing the
genotyping assay, analyzing the data, and reporting the results
accurately.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory personnel to
ensure that all steps outlined in this procedure are followed
accurately and meticulously.
1. DEFINITION
Cytochrome P450 2C19 (CYP2C19) is an enzyme that is involved in
the metabolism of various pharmaceutical substances. Genotyping
for CYP2C19 identifies specific polymorphisms in the gene encoding
CYP2C19, which can influence drug metabolism and response.
1. PROCEDURE
Specimen Requirements:
• Blood specimen collected in an EDTA tube or buccal swab.
• The specimen must be properly labeled with patient information
and accession number.
• Prior to analysis, confirm that the specimen has been collected,
received, and accessioned appropriately.
Equipment, Reagents and Supplies:
• DNA extraction kit
• PCR reagents (primers, dNTPs, buffer, Taq polymerase)
• Thermal cycler
• Gel electrophoresis apparatus
• DNA ladder
• Ethidium bromide or alternative DNA stain
• UV transilluminator
• Analysis software/program for genotyping
DNA Extraction:
1. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for extracting DNA from
the blood specimen or buccal swab.
2. Quantify the DNA using a spectrophotometer to ensure
sufficient yield and purity (A260/A280 ratio).
3. Store DNA samples at -20°C until ready for PCR amplification.
PCR Amplification:
1. Prepare the PCR master mix according to the specific protocol
for CYP2C19 genotyping. Ensure to include positive and
negative controls:
◦ 1X PCR buffer
◦ 200 µM dNTPs
◦ 0.2 µM of each primer
◦ 1.5 mM MgCl2
◦ 0.5 U Taq polymerase
◦ Template DNA (10-100 ng)
2. Aliquot the master mix into PCR tubes, adding the template
DNA last.
3. Place the tubes in the thermal cycler and run the following
program:
◦ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 5 minutes
◦ 35 cycles of:
▪ Denaturation: 95°C for 30 seconds
▪ Annealing: 55°C for 30 seconds
▪ Extension: 72°C for 1 minute
◦ Final extension: 72°C for 5 minutes
◦ Hold at 4°C
Gel Electrophoresis:
1. Prepare a 1-2% agarose gel with ethidium bromide.
2. Load PCR products alongside a DNA ladder.
3. Run the gel at 100V for 30-45 minutes.
4. Visualize the gel using a UV transilluminator.
Data Analysis:
1. Analyze the gel electrophoresis results by comparing the bands
of the samples to the DNA ladder and controls to identify the
presence of specific CYP2C19 alleles.
2. Document the genotyping results accordingly.
Quality Control:
1. Include positive and negative control samples in each PCR run
to ensure the accuracy of the assay.
2. Review the control results. If any controls fail, troubleshoot the
PCR reaction and rerun the samples.
3. Record all observations and steps taken in the laboratory
logbook.
Reporting Results:
1. Enter the genotyping results into the laboratory information
system (LIS).
2. Review and verify all data for accuracy.
3. Generate the final report, including the genotype of CYP2C19
and any relevant interpretative comments based on current
guidelines.
4. Ensure the report is signed off by the qualified personnel before
releasing to the clinician or patient.
