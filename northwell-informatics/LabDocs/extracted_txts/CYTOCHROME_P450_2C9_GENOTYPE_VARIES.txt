1. PURPOSE The purpose of this Standard Operating Procedure
(SOP) is to outline the process for generating results for
CYTOCHROME P450 2C9 (CYP2C9) genotyping in a clinical
laboratory setting. This SOP encompasses the analytical phase
from DNA extraction to the final verification and reporting of
CYP2C9 genotypes.
Responsibility: Qualified laboratory personnel, including medical
laboratory technologists and molecular biologists, are responsible for
carrying out this SOP. It is the responsibility of all staff to identify any
discrepancies or issues during the analytical process and notify a
supervisor immediately.
1. SPECIMEN • Specimen Type: Whole blood, collected in EDTA
tubes. • Volume: Minimum of 2 mL. • Storage: Specimens
should be kept at 2-8°C if processed within 7 days; otherwise,
store at -20°C or lower for longer-term stability.
2. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES • DNA extraction
kit (e.g., Qiagen QIAamp® DNA Blood Mini Kit) • PCR
amplification kit and reagents • Real-time PCR system and
appropriate consumables • Primers and probes specific to
CYP2C9 variants (e.g., *2, *3) • Nuclease-free water •
Disposable gloves, lab coat, and eye protection • Pipettes and
pipette tips • Centrifuge • PCR tubes/plate and strips • Thermal
cycler
3. PROCEDURE
A. DNA Extraction:
1. Thaw frozen blood samples at room temperature if applicable.
2. Follow the DNA extraction protocol as outlined in the
manufacturer’s instructions for the chosen DNA extraction kit.
3. Quantify the extracted DNA using a spectrophotometer or
fluorometer and assess purity (A260/280 ratio).
B. PCR Amplification:
1. Prepare PCR master mix according to the manufacturer's
instructions. Include: • DNA template (100-200 ng) • PCR buffer
• dNTP mix • MgCl2 • Primers (forward and reverse) and probes
specific for CYP2C9 variants • DNA polymerase
2. Aliquot PCR master mix into PCR tubes or a 96-well plate,
adding the DNA template to each reaction well.
3. Perform PCR with the following cycling conditions (example): •
Initial denaturation: 95°C for 10 minutes • Denaturation: 95°C
for 15 seconds • Annealing/Extension: 60°C for 1 minute •
Repeat for 40 cycles
4. Include appropriate positive and negative controls to ensure
assay validity.
C. Real-Time PCR Analysis:
1. Load the PCR plate into the real-time PCR system.
2. Run the real-time PCR program and monitor amplification
curves.
3. Analyze the data using appropriate software provided with the
real-time PCR system.
4. Determine the presence of CYP2C9 variants based on the
amplification profiles.
D. Result Interpretation:
1. Identify the genotype based on the presence or absence of
specific CYP2C9 variant alleles (e.g., *1/*1, *1/*2, *1/*3, *2/*2,
*2/*3, *3/*3).
2. Compare results to established genotype-phenotype
correlations provided in clinical references.
3. QUALITY CONTROL • Include positive control DNA with known
CYP2C9 genotypes, negative control (no DNA template), and
reagent-only control in each run. • Results should only be
accepted if controls are within expected ranges. • Document
quality control results and troubleshooting steps if any
deviations occur.
4. REPORTING RESULTS • Document the genotype of each
sample in the Laboratory Information System (LIS). • Include
interpretation of results based on genotype-phenotype
correlations where applicable. • Communicate results to the
ordering physician following site-specific guidelines.
5. REFERENCES Provide relevant scientific literature and kit
inserts/reagent manuals used in the SOP.
By following these procedures, the laboratory aims to ensure the
accurate and reliable determination of CYP2C9 genotypes, aiding in
personalized patient care and treatment optimization.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS Refer to the manufacturer’s
specifications and literature for any known limitations inherent
to the specific reagents or instruments used. Ensure all
operators are aware of these limitations and their potential
impact on the results.
2. STORAGE AND RECORDS Maintain documentation of all
procedures, quality controls, and results as per laboratory
protocol. Store records electronically or in hard copy form as
required by regulatory authorities for at least 5 years.
