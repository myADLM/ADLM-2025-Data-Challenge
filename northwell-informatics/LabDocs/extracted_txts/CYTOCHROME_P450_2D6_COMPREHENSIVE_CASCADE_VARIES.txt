Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Cytochrome P450 2D6
Comprehensive Cascade Analysis
1. PURPOSE
The Cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) comprehensive cascade
analysis is performed to determine the genotype of the CYP2D6
enzyme, which is involved in the metabolism of many drugs. This
information is critical in guiding personalized medication therapy. This
SOP covers the procedures for the analytical phase of generating
results once specimens have already been collected, received, and
accessioned.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for following this
SOP.
• It is the responsibility of laboratory supervisors to ensure all
procedures are performed correctly and to identify and
immediately address any issues that may impact test results.
2. PROCEDURE
A. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies
• Real-Time PCR thermocycler
• DNA extraction kits (validated for use with blood or buccal swab
samples)
• TaqMan® Genotyping Master Mix
• CYP2D6 specific TaqMan® Assays
• Optical 96-well reaction plates and adhesive covers
• Pipettes and aerosol-resistant tips
• Nuclease-free water
• Laboratory-grade ethanol
• Calibrated microcentrifuge
B. DNA Extraction
1. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for the validated DNA
extraction kit to extract genomic DNA from the specimen (blood
or buccal swab).
2. Quantify DNA concentration using a spectrophotometer and
standardize the DNA to a working concentration of 5 ng/µL
using nuclease-free water.
3. Store extracted DNA at -20°C until ready for PCR setup.
C. PCR Setup
1. Prepare the PCR reaction mix in a clean, DNA-free
environment to avoid contamination:
◦ 10 µL of TaqMan® Genotyping Master Mix
◦ 1 µL of CYP2D6 specific TaqMan® Assay
◦ 4 µL of nuclease-free water
◦ 5 µL of standardized DNA sample (5 ng/µL)
2. Mix the reaction components thoroughly by gently vortexing
and then briefly centrifuging.
3. Dispense 20 µL of the prepared PCR reaction mix into each
well of the optical 96-well plate. Use a new pipette tip for each
sample to avoid cross-contamination.
4. Seal the reaction plate with an optical adhesive cover and
briefly centrifuge to remove any air bubbles.
D. PCR Cycling Conditions
• Load the reaction plate into the Real-Time PCR thermocycler.
• Set up the thermocycler with the following cycling conditions:
◦ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 10 minutes
◦ 40 cycles of:
▪ Denaturation: 95°C for 15 seconds
▪ Annealing/Extension: 60°C for 1 minute
E. Data Analysis
1. Collect fluorescence data at the end of each cycle and analyze
using the thermocycler’s software.
2. Determine the allelic composition for each sample based on the
fluorescence signal.
3. Assign genotypes according to established CYP2D6 allele
calling conventions.
F. Quality Control
1. Include positive and negative controls in each run to ensure the
validity of the results.
2. Perform internal quality control checks such as replicate testing
of a subset of samples to ensure consistency and reliability.
3. Review and document any anomalies or unexpected results for
further investigation.
G. Reporting Results
1. Review all data to ensure it passes the quality control checks.
2. Verify and interpret results according to laboratory guidelines.
3. Enter verified results into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS) for physician review.
4. Provide a comprehensive report, including the patient's
CYP2D6 genotype and any relevant phenotype predictions.
H. Sample Integrity and Critical Results
1. If sample integrity is compromised (e.g., hemolysis,
contaminants), document the issue and request a new
specimen.
2. Critical genotyping results that have significant therapeutic
implications should be promptly communicated to the treating
physician as per laboratory policy.
3. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results are to be documented and verified promptly post-
analysis. Any discrepancies must be addressed immediately and
corrective action taken.
• Comprehensive genotype and phenotype interpretations must be
provided in a clear, concise report format, suitable for inclusion in
the patient records.
4. REFERENCE INTERVALS:
Not applicable (this test provides qualitative genotyping data, not
quantitative measurements).
5. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
• DNA quality and concentration may affect the accuracy of the
results.
• Genotyping may not detect rare or novel variants not included in
the assay design.
6. REFERENCES:
• Manufacturer’s instructions and guidelines for TaqMan®
Genotyping Assays.
• Approved laboratory-developed test validation documentation.
End of SOP for Cytochrome P450 2D6 Comprehensive Cascade
Analysis. Ensure all personnel involved are appropriately trained and
competent in executing this procedure. Continuous monitoring and
periodic review of this SOP should be undertaken to incorporate
advancements and improvements in testing methodology.
