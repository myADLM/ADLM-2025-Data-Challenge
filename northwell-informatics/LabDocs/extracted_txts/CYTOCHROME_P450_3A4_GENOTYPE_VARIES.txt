Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for CYTOCHROME P450 3A4 GENOTYPE
1. Purpose To provide a standardized procedure for the analytical
phase of generating results for Cytochrome P450 3A4
(CYP3A4) genotype testing. The aim is to ensure reliable and
accurate results for patient care.
2. Scope This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel performing
CYP3A4 genotype testing in the clinical laboratory. The
procedure outlined includes pre-analytical, analytical, and post-
analytical steps to ensure accuracy and quality of results.
3. Definitions
• CYP3A4: Cytochrome P450 3A4, a key enzyme in drug
metabolism.
• PCR: Polymerase Chain Reaction, a technique used to amplify
DNA.
• Genotyping: The process of determining differences in the genetic
make-up (genotype) using biological assays.
1. Responsibility Laboratory technologists are responsible for
following this SOP to perform and document CYP3A4 genotype
analyses. Supervisors are responsible for overseeing the
process and ensuring adherence to the procedure, including
any corrective actions required.
2. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies
• PCR thermocycler
• DNA extraction kit
• CYP3A4 specific primers and probes
• Real-time PCR master mix
• Positive and negative control DNAs
• Microcentrifuge
• PCR tubes and plates
• Pipettes and tips
• Nuclease-free water
• Laboratory notebook or electronic log for documentation
1. Procedure
A) Sample Preparation and DNA Extraction:
1. Quality Control Check:
▪ Verify specimen is properly labeled and that patient
information is correctly documented.
▪ Ensure the specimen is free from contamination and is
suitable for testing (blood, buccal swab, saliva).
2. DNA Extraction:
▪ Use a DNA extraction kit according to the
manufacturer's instructions to extract genomic DNA
from the patient sample.
▪ Measure the DNA concentration and purity using a
spectrophotometer (260/280 ratio should be between
1.8 – 2.0).
▪ Store extracted DNA at -20°C until ready for PCR
analysis.
B) PCR Amplification and Genotyping:
1. PCR Mix Preparation:
▪ Thaw all PCR reagents on ice.
▪ Prepare a master mix containing the following:
▪ Real-time PCR master mix
▪ Forward and reverse primers
▪ CYP3A4 specific probe
▪ Nuclease-free water
▪ Aliquot the master mix into PCR tubes or plates,
adding the extracted DNA (patient sample, positive
control, and negative control) to each well/tube.
2. PCR Protocol:
▪ Place tubes or plates in the PCR thermocycler and set
the appropriate cycling conditions:
▪ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 10 minutes
▪ Amplification: 40 cycles of:
▪ Denaturation: 95°C for 15 seconds
▪ Annealing/Extension: 60°C for 1 minute
3. Real-time PCR Analysis:
▪ Monitor the amplification in real-time using the PCR
thermocycler software.
▪ Analyze the amplification curves to determine the
presence or absence of specific CYP3A4 alleles.
▪ Ensure proper controls (positive and negative) are
functioning correctly.
C) Post-Analytical Steps:
1. Data Analysis:
▪ Analyze the PCR data to determine the genotype of
the CYP3A4 gene for each patient sample.
▪ Record genotyping results in a laboratory notebook or
electronic logging system.
2. Result Verification:
▪ Double-check results for accuracy and ensure controls
are within acceptable limits.
▪ If any discrepancy is noted, repeat the PCR analysis
for confirmation.
3. Reporting Results:
▪ Generate a laboratory report indicating the CYP3A4
genotype of the patient.
▪ Include any interpretation of results as necessary for
clinical decision-making (e.g., implications for drug
metabolism).
4. Result Documentation and Storage:
▪ Archive PCR data and raw results securely according
to institutional and regulatory requirements.
▪ Store electronic records with restricted access to
ensure patient confidentiality.
2. Quality Control and Maintenance:
◦ Run positive and negative controls with each batch of
samples.
◦ Participate in regular proficiency testing to ensure accuracy
of genotyping.
◦ Maintain and calibrate equipment according to manufacturer
guidelines.
◦ Document all maintenance activities in the equipment log.
3. Limitations and Troubleshooting:
◦ Ensure DNA quality and concentration are within acceptable
range.
◦ Verify primer and probe specificity to avoid non-specific
amplification.
◦ Repeat analysis for any ambiguous results or if controls do
not perform as expected.
