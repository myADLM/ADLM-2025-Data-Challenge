Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Analytical Phase
of Generating Results for CYTOCHROME P450 3A5
GENOTYPE
1. PURPOSE
To ensure precise and accurate determination of the CYTOCHROME
P450 3A5 (CYP3A5) genotype using validated molecular techniques.
2. DEFINITIONS
CYTOCHROME P450 3A5 (CYP3A5) Genotyping: A molecular assay
used to determine the genotype and identify polymorphisms in the
CYP3A5 gene which can affect drug metabolism.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
Qualified molecular laboratory personnel are responsible for
performing and interpreting the CYP3A5 genotyping assay according
to this SOP.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
1. Equipment:
◦ Real-Time PCR (qPCR) or conventional PCR machine
◦ Microcentrifuge
◦ Pipettes and tips (sterile, filtered)
◦ Vortex mixer
◦ Thermal cycler
2. Reagents:
◦ DNA extraction kit
◦ Taq polymerase
◦ dNTP mix
◦ Magnesium chloride solution
◦ CYP3A5-specific primers and probes (if using qPCR)
◦ PCR buffer
◦ Nuclease-free water
3. Supplies:
◦ PCR tubes or plates
◦ Microcentrifuge tubes
◦ Gloves
◦ Laboratory bench cleaner
◦ Disposable lab coats and safety goggles
5. PROCEDURE
A) DNA Extraction
1. Use the designated DNA extraction kit following the
manufacturer’s instructions to extract genomic DNA from the
received sample.
2. Quantify the DNA concentration using a spectrophotometer and
adjust the concentration to an optimal range for PCR (10-50 ng/
µL).
3. Document the DNA concentration and integrity.
B) PCR Amplification
1. Prepare the PCR master mix:
◦ 10µL 2X PCR buffer
◦ 0.5µL 10mM dNTP mix
◦ 1µL forward primer (10 µM)
◦ 1µL reverse primer (10 µM)
◦ 1µL Taq polymerase
◦ 1.5µL MgCl2 (25 mM, optional depending on the
polymerase used)
◦ Nuclease-free water to a total volume of 20µL
2. Add 8µL of extracted DNA to the PCR master mix to make a
total reaction volume of 28µL.
3. Mix gently and centrifuge briefly to collect all components at the
bottom of the tube.
4. Load the reaction mix into the PCR tubes or plate.
C) PCR Cycling Conditions
1. Place the tubes/plate into the thermal cycler and run the
following protocol:
◦ Initial denaturation at 95°C for 3 minutes
◦ 40 cycles of:
▪ Denaturation at 95°C for 30 seconds
▪ Annealing at 60°C for 30 seconds
▪ Extension at 72°C for 1 minute
◦ Final extension at 72°C for 5 minutes
◦ Hold at 4°C indefinitely until ready for analysis.
D) Detection and Genotyping
1. If using qPCR: Analyze the amplification plots and determine
the genotype based on the presence or absence of specific
amplification curves corresponding to the alleles.
2. If using conventional PCR: Run the PCR products on an
agarose gel (2-3%) for size separation.
E) Gel Electrophoresis (for conventional PCR)
1. Prepare 2-3% agarose gel with ethidium bromide or an
alternative DNA stain.
2. Load 5µL of PCR product mixed with 1µL of loading dye into
each well.
3. Run the gel at 100 volts for approximately 45-60 minutes.
4. Visualize the PCR products under UV light.
F) Interpretation
1. Compare the observed bands to a known DNA ladder and
CYP3A5 controls to determine the genotype (e.g., *1/*1, *1/*3,
*3/*3).
2. Document and interpret the genotyping results according to
standard genotyping charts.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Include negative controls (no DNA template) in every PCR run
to detect contamination.
2. Include positive controls (known genotypes) to ensure the
accuracy and reliability of the assay.
3. Perform regular calibration and maintenance of all equipment
according to the manufacturer's guidelines.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Enter and verify all results in the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
2. Ensure all data (PCR, gel images, qPCR plots) are archived
according to the laboratory’s data management guidelines.
3. Flag any atypical or questionable results for supervisor review
before final reporting.
