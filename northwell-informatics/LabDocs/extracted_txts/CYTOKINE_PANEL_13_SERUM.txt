CYTOKINE PANEL 13, SERUM Standard Operating Procedure
(SOP)
1. PURPOSE:
This document provides a detailed protocol for the analytical phase of
generating results for the Cytokine Panel 13, Serum. This procedure
ensures accurate and consistent testing, data integrity, and high
standards of laboratory practice.
Responsibility:
• It is the responsibility of designated laboratory personnel to
perform the procedures as outlined below.
• Lab supervisors are required to ensure that the personnel are
adequately trained and competent in these procedures.
1. SPECIMEN:
Specimen Type:
• 5 mL of serum is preferred, collected in a red-top or serum
separator tube (SST).
Specimen Handling:
• Allow the blood to clot at room temperature for at least 30 minutes
but no longer than 1 hour.
• Centrifuge the blood for 10 minutes at 1500 x g at room
temperature to separate the serum.
• Immediately aliquot the serum into a labeled, sterile,
polypropylene tube.
• Store at 2-8°C if the test is to be performed within 72 hours;
otherwise, freeze at -20°C or lower for longer storage.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
• Specimens that have not been centrifuged and separated
appropriately.
• Specimens not properly stored or shipped with potential thermal
damage.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES:
• ELISA or Multiplex Bead-Based Assay System as specified by the
kit manufacturer.
• Calibrated micropipettes and tips.
• Vortex mixer.
• 96-well microplate (for the ELISA method) or appropriate assay
plate (for the multiplex method).
• Centrifuge capable of achieving 1500 x g.
• Plate reader with appropriate filter settings (e.g., 450 nm for
ELISA).
• Standard lab supplies (gloves, lab coat, disposable pipettes, etc.).
1. PROCEDURE:
A) Equipment Preparation:
1. Turn on the plate reader, vortex mixer, and centrifuge. Ensure
all equipment is calibrated and functioning correctly.
2. Set up the workstation with necessary tools and reagents,
including the pipettes, assay plates, standards, controls,
buffers, and detection reagents provided in the assay kit.
B) Reagent Preparation:
1. Equilibrate all reagents and samples to room temperature
before use.
2. Prepare standards and controls as specified in the kit insert.
3. Prepare detection and wash buffers according to kit
instructions.
4. Label all reagents and samples to maintain traceability and
prevent cross-contamination.
C) Assay Procedure (Example for ELISA method):
1. Prepare the 96-well plate according to the assay layout plan,
including standards, controls, and patient samples.
2. Add the appropriate volume of standards, controls, and serum
samples to the assigned wells.
3. Add detection antibodies and reagents according to the kit
instructions.
4. Incubate the plate at the specified temperature and duration
outlined in the kit insert.
5. Wash the plate as recommended to remove unbound materials.
6. Add substrate solution and incubate for the time recommended
in the kit insert.
7. Stop the reaction by adding the stop solution provided in the kit.
D) Plate Reading:
1. Read the absorbance on the plate reader at the specified
wavelength.
2. Ensure that all wells are free from bubbles and are evenly filled.
3. Record the absorbance values for standards, controls, and
serum samples.
E) Data Analysis:
1. Generate a standard curve using the absorbance values of
known cytokine concentrations (standards).
2. Calculate the concentration of cytokines in serum samples
using the standard curve.
3. Verify data integrity, cross-check with quality control data, and
troubleshoot any outliers or anomalous readings.
4. QUALITY CONTROL:
5. Utilize internal quality control materials from the kit with each
run for assessing the assay performance.
6. Document all QC results and ensure they fall within acceptable
ranges. Investigate any failures or anomalies.
7. Regularly calibrate and maintain all laboratory instruments
involved in the assay process.
8. Document any corrective actions taken for any deviations from
the protocol or quality control failures.
9. REPORTING RESULTS:
10. Review all generated data for accuracy and precision.
11. Record the final results in the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
12. Ensure that all calculated cytokine concentrations are within the
expected reference ranges.
13. Immediately notify the supervisor of any critical results or
discrepancies.
14. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
Refer to the manufacturer's kit insert for any specific limitations
related to the assay performance, interferences, or cross-reactivity.

maintenance.
1. DOCUMENTATION:
Record all steps taken, results obtained, and any deviations in the
assay logbook or electronic record system. Ensure that all personnel
performing the assays sign off on their entries.
