Standard Operating Procedure for Cytokine Panel Testing
1. PURPOSE
To provide a detailed procedure for the analytical phase of generating
results for a Cytokine Panel, Plasma.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel authorized to
perform and document testing and results for Cytokine Panel,
Plasma.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory personnel to
adhere to this protocol for testing, including proper calibration, quality
control, sample preparation, and result documentation. Supervisors
must ensure that the laboratory personnel follow this SOP
accordingly.
4. DEFINITIONS
Cytokine Panel, Plasma: A laboratory test measuring various
cytokines (e.g., IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α) in the plasma, typically used for
assessing inflammatory status in patients.
5. SAMPLE PREPARATION
Specimen: Preferably EDTA plasma.
• Acceptable: Plasma collected in EDTA tubes.
• Unacceptable: Samples other than plasma (e.g., serum),
hemolyzed samples, or samples not stored properly as defined
below.
Storage and Stability:
• Plasma samples should be stored at 2-8°C and processed within
24 hours.
• For long-term storage, freeze at -20°C or lower. Avoid repeated
freeze-thaw cycles.
6. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• Cytokine assay kits (specific brand/system used in the lab)
• Calibration standards and controls
• Pipettes and tips
• Plate washer
• Plate reader (compatible with the assay format, e.g., ELISA,
multiplex)
• Laboratory bench with appropriate safety measures (e.g., PPE,
biosafety hood)
7. PROCEDURE
A) PREPARATION AND CALIBRATION
1. Reagent Preparation: Follow the manufacturer's instructions
for reagent reconstitution and preparation. Allow all reagents
and samples to reach room temperature before use.
2. Calibration:
◦ Calibrate the plate reader using the calibration standards
provided in the assay kit.
◦ Validate the calibration by running high, medium, and low
controls.
◦ Document calibration results and ensure they meet the
assay's acceptance criteria before proceeding.
B) SAMPLE ANALYSIS
1. Sample Handling:
◦ Thaw frozen plasma samples quickly in a 37°C water bath
and mix gently.
◦ Centrifuge samples at 1500-2000 g for 10 minutes to
remove particulates, if necessary.
◦ Aliquot a specified volume of plasma (as per the assay
protocol, usually 50-100 µL) into designated wells of the
assay plate.
2. Assay Execution:
◦ Follow the manufacturer's protocol for the specific cytokine
assay kit being used. This typically includes: a. Adding
samples, standards, and controls to the assay plate. b.
Incubating the plate for specified times at specified
temperatures. c. Washing steps between additions of
reagents. d. Adding detection antibodies and substrates. e.
Measuring absorbance or fluorescence as specified by the
assay protocol.
3. Reading and Recording:
◦ Use the plate reader to measure the signal (absorbance/
fluorescence).
◦ Save and record data generated by the plate reader.
◦ Ensure that internal quality controls are within specified
ranges before interpreting patient results.
C) RESULTS CALCULATION AND INTERPRETATION
1. Data Analysis:
◦ Analyze raw data using appropriate software/tools provided
by the assay manufacturer.
◦ Generate standard curves for each cytokine.
◦ Calculate concentrations of cytokines in plasma samples
using standard curves.
2. Quality Control:
◦ Verify that control samples fall within the expected range.
◦ If quality control samples are outside the acceptable range,
troubleshoot as necessary (e.g., check reagent expiry,
system calibration, repeat assay).
D) REPORTING RESULTS
1. Result Documentation:
◦ Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
ensuring accurate transfer from raw data.
◦ Review results for any notable patterns or deviations.
2. Result Verification:
◦ A second authorized laboratory personnel should review
results before verification.
◦ Verify and release results following the standard laboratory
protocol for result certification.
8. QUALITY ASSURANCE
• Participate in proficiency testing as required.
• Perform regular maintenance and calibration of equipment as per
the manufacturer's recommendations.
• Document all quality control measures taken using internal logs.
9. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's assay kit insert and guidelines.
• Laboratory quality control and equipment manuals.
10. APPENDICES
• Standard forms for recording calibration, quality control, and
maintenance logs.
• Detailed troubleshooting guide for common issues.
11. DISCLAIMER
This protocol is subject to periodic review and updates to maintain
compliance with best practices and regulatory standards.
