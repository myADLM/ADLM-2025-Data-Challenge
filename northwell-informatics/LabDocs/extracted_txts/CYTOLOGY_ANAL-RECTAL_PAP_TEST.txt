Cytology Analytical Phase Protocol – Anal-
Rectal Pap Test
Purpose
To ensure accurate and reliable results for Anal-Rectal Pap Test
cytology specimens.
Responsibility
Designated cytotechnologists and pathologists are responsible for
processing, analyzing, and making final interpretations of Anal-Rectal
Pap Test specimens. It is the responsibility of all staff involved to
adhere to this SOP to ensure consistency, quality, and accuracy of
test results.
Specimen
Requirements and Stability
• Preferred Specimen: Anal-Rectal brush collection sample fixed in
PreservCyt solution to prevent cellular degradation.
• Specimens must be labeled properly with patient's information
and collection date/time.
• Unacceptable Specimen: Specimens without proper labeling,
dried out, or submitted in containers other than the recommended
preservative solution.
Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies
• Automated cytology processing system (e.g., ThinPrep or
SurePath)
• Cytology preparation stains (Papanicolaou stain)
• Microscope
• PreservCyt or equivalent fixative
• Glass microscope slides
Procedure
Preparation
1. Confirm that specimen container is properly labeled and that
the sample is adequate for analysis.
2. Vortex the specimen vial to mix cells in solution thoroughly.
3. Prepare the slide using automated cytology preparation system:
◦ Load the specimen into the cell preparation unit following
manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Process the sample to prepare a thin layer slide.
4. Allow the slide to air dry or use specified drying protocol as
required by the preparation system.
Staining
1. Place the air-dried slide into the staining rack.
2. Stain the slide using the Papanicolaou (Pap) stain protocol.
◦ Dip slide in 95% Ethanol for fixation.
◦ Rinse in distilled water.
◦ Stain in hematoxylin.
◦ Rinse in warm water to remove excess stain.
◦ Differentiate in acid-alcohol solution.
◦ Bluing in Scott’s solution or lithium carbonate.
◦ Stain sequentially with Orange G and Eosin Azure.
◦ Dehydrate through graded alcohols.
◦ Clear in xylene or equivalent.
3. Mount a coverslip using xylene-based mounting medium.
Microscopy and Result Interpretation
1. Examine the stained slide under a microscope with at least a
10x - 40x magnification.
2. Identify and record all cytologic features within the specimen.
3. Classify findings according to the Bethesda System for
Reporting Anal Cytology:
◦ Negative for Intraepithelial Lesion or Malignancy (NILM)
◦ Atypical Squamous Cells (ASC)
◦ Low-grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesion (LSIL)
◦ High-grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesion (HSIL)
◦ Invasive carcinoma
Quality Control
• Run positive and negative controls with each batch of slides
stained.
• Review and document quality control findings in the Cytology
Quality Control log.
• Perform periodic proficiency testing as defined by CLIA
regulations.
Reporting Results
1. Once all analyses are complete, validate results using
predetermined criteria.
2. Document findings in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
3. Pathologist reviews and signs out the final report.
4. Transmit final report to the requesting clinician following
laboratory protocols.
Reference Intervals
Refer to the Bethesda System for Reporting Anal Cytology for
interpretation criteria.
Method Limitations
• Accuracy of results is dependent on specimen adequacy and
quality of staining.
• Presence of inflammatory cells or blood may obscure diagnostic
cellular details.
