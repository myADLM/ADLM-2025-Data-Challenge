Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Cytology, Aspirates,
and Fine-Needle Aspiration (FNA)
1. PURPOSE
To provide a detailed protocol for the processing, preparation, and
analysis of cytology specimens from aspirates and fine-needle
aspiration (FNA) biopsies to ensure accurate and reliable diagnostic
results.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory personnel to
ensure that all steps of the processing and analysis are performed
according to the procedure and within the scope of their certification
and training.
2. SAMPLE INFORMATION
Specimen Collection:
• Aspirates and FNA samples should be placed in a sterile
container with optimal transport medium.
• Include relevant clinical information and ensure the sample
container is properly labeled with the patient’s name, identification
number, date and time of collection, and the site of collection.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Unlabeled or improperly labeled specimens.
• Specimens without proper documentation or requisition.
• Specimens that have leaked during transport.
• Specimens that were not stored or transported at the required
temperature.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Microscopes
• Centrifuge
• Glass slides
• Cover slips
• Staining reagents (e.g., Papanicolaou stain, Diff-Quik stain)
• Mounting medium
• Formalin for fixing
• Transport medium
• Sterile containers
4. PROCEDURE
A) Receiving and Processing the Specimen:
1. Receipt of Specimen:
◦ Verify patient information, ensure labels match the
requisition.
◦ Log the receipt in the laboratory information system (LIS).
2. Preparation of Slides:
1. Direct Smears:
▪ If the sample is in a syringe, express a drop of the
aspirate onto a labeled glass slide.
▪ Place another labeled slide over the drop and pull
apart to make two smears.
2. Centrifugation:
▪ Spin down the remaining fluid in a centrifuge at 1500
rpm for 5 minutes to obtain a sediment.
▪ Prepare additional smears or a cell block from the
sediment.
3. Fixation:
◦ Fix the smears immediately in 95% ethanol or spray fixative
if using Papanicolaou stain.
◦ For Diff-Quik staining, allow the smears to air dry.
B) Staining:
1. Papanicolaou Stain:
◦ Hydrate slides in descending grades of ethanol to water.
◦ Stain using hematoxylin for nuclear staining.
◦ Rinse in water.
◦ Dip in 70% ethanol followed by orange G stain.
◦ Rinse in 95% ethanol followed by Eosin Azure.
◦ Dehydrate through increasing grades of ethanol to xylene.
◦ Coverslip with mounting medium.
2. Diff-Quik Stain:
◦ Fix slides in methanol for 1-2 minutes.
◦ Dip slides in solution I for 10-15 dips.
◦ Rinse briefly in deionized water.
◦ Dip slides in solution II for 5-10 dips.
◦ Rinse in deionized water and air-dry.
◦ Coverslip with mounting medium if required.
C) Microscopic Examination:
1. Screening:
◦ A cytotechnologist or pathologist screens the slides for
cellular abnormalities.
◦ A minimum of 100 fields should be reviewed.
◦ Record any findings in the LIS.
2. Review:
◦ Power of magnification: start at low magnification (10X) and
examine more suspicious areas using higher magnification
(40X).
◦ Look for cellular patterns, reactive changes, malignancy
indicators, and cell structure integrity.
◦ Utilize immunocytochemistry or special stains as needed for
further characterization.
D) Reporting:
1. Documentation:
◦ Findings are documented in the laboratory information
system.
◦ Include descriptions of cellular morphology, presence of
malignancy, reactive and benign changes.
◦ If necessary, include recommendations for further testing or
follow-up.
◦ The report should be reviewed and signed by a qualified
pathologist before release.
2. Reporting Results:
• Ensure that results are reported in accordance with site-specific
guidelines.
• If immediate communication is required (e.g., critical results or
malignant findings), notify the referring physician promptly and
document the communication.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Internal Quality Control:
◦ Regularly verify stain performance by including control
slides with known positive and negative findings.
◦ Keep a log of all control slide results and review for
consistency.
2. Proficiency Testing:
◦ Participate in external proficiency testing programs at
prescribed intervals to ensure continued accuracy.
◦ Document and review results.
3. Equipment Maintenance:
◦ Ensure routine preventive maintenance and calibration of
microscopes, centrifuges, and other equipment.
◦ Record all maintenance activities and any corrective actions
taken.
