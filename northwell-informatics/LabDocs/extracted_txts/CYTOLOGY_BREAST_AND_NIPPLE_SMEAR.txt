Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Cytology, Breast and Nipple
Smear Analysis
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the procedure for the analysis of breast and nipple
smear cytology samples to ensure accurate and timely results.
Breast and nipple smear cytology involves microscopic examination
of exfoliated cells collected from the breast nipple for the detection of
malignant and non-malignant lesions.
Responsibility:
• Designated cytology staff will perform the analysis and document
the results.
• All staff should report any issues affecting the analysis to the
supervisor immediately.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Acceptable Specimens:
• Breast and nipple smear collected using a cyto smear slide with
fixative.
• Samples should be labeled with patient information, collection
date, and time.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Smears without patient information or collection date and time.
• Smears dried out or inadequately fixed.
• Smears contaminated with foreign materials affecting
morphological assessment.
• Specimens collected using inappropriate methods or containers.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, SUPPLIES
• Microscope
• Cytology smear slides with fixative
• Pap stain reagents
◦ Hematoxylin
◦ Orange G
◦ EA-50 (eosin azure)
◦ 95% ethanol and 100% ethanol
◦ Xylene
• Immersion oil
• Cleaning supplies for microscope
• Standard laboratory PPE (gloves, lab coat)
1. PROCEDURE
Preparation of Smears:
1. Verify patient information on each slide before analysis.
2. Inspect slides for proper fixation and any noticeable artifacts.
3. Place slides in staining racks in preparation for the Pap stain.
Pap Staining Process:
1. Immerse slides in 95% ethanol for 2 minutes to rehydrate the
smear.
2. Apply hematoxylin stain for 5 minutes.
3. Rinse slides in running tap water for 3 minutes.
4. Dip slides in 95% ethanol for 30 seconds.
5. Stain slides with Orange G for 1 minute.
6. Rinse slides in 95% ethanol for 30 seconds.
7. Stain slides with EA-50 for 2 minutes.
8. Rinse slides sequentially in 95% ethanol and 100% ethanol for
30 seconds each.
9. Clear slides in xylene for 2 minutes (ensure proper ventilation
and use of PPE).
10. Mount coverslips using mounting medium and allow to dry.
Microscopic Examination:
1. Use a clean microscope with proper calibration.
2. Start examination under low power magnification and proceed
to higher magnifications as needed.
3. Assess the cellular morphology including size, shape, nucleus
and cytoplasm characteristics.
4. Identify and record any pathological findings including atypical
cells, signs of infection, or malignancy.
5. Document findings clearly including patient ID, date of
examination, and technologist's initials.
Troubleshooting:
1. If staining results are inadequate, repeat the staining process
on new smears.
2. Consult with supervisor if abnormal cell populations are
observed or if results are inconclusive.
3. Revalidate microscope calibration if visual discrepancies are
reported.
4. Inform supervisor immediately if repeated staining and fixation
issues persist.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
• Use control slides processed alongside patient samples to
validate staining efficacy.
• Record staining and examination dates along with initials on a
quality control log.
• Monthly calibration and maintenance of microscopic devices.
• Periodic proficiency testing for cytology staff to ensure consistent
performance.
• Follow corrective actions for any discrepancies or variation in
control samples.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Utilize site-specific reporting guidelines.
• Review and verify all cytology results.
• Critical findings must be communicated to the relevant clinical
personnel promptly.
• Document and archive all results following laboratory standards.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Normal cytology: No evidence of malignancy or atypia.
• Abnormal cytology: Presence of atypical cells, suspicious for
malignancy or infections needing follow up.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to manufacturer instructions for staining reagents and
microscope usage. Samples should be processed within standard
timelines post-collection to avoid cytological artifacts.
