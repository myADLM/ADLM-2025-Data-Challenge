Standard Operating Procedure: Analytical Phase for Processing
and Generating Results for Cytology Brushings
1. PURPOSE
This procedure outlines the steps for the analytical phase of
processing cytology brushings to ensure accurate and reliable
generation of results.
2. SCOPE
This protocol applies to all staff involved in the processing, analysis,
and reporting of cytology brushings in the laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• It is the responsibility of the designated cytotechnologist and
pathologist to ensure accurate processing and interpretation of
cytology brushings.
• Laboratory staff are responsible for ensuring documentation and
quality control compliance throughout the analytical process.
4. DEFINITIONS
Cytology Brushings: Specimens collected using a brush to scrape
cells from a mucosal surface, often used for diagnostic purposes in
cases involving suspicion of malignancies or infections.
5. PROCEDURE
A) Specimen Preparation
1. Receipt and Verification
◦ Verify that the specimen received matches the patient
information and requisition form.
◦ Check the specimen container for proper labeling, date, and
time of collection.
2. Processing Cytology Brushings
◦ Prepare the slides by rolling the bristle brush gently onto a
clean glass slide. Make sure to cover the brush's entire
bristle area in a singular motion to avoid cell clumping.
◦ For air-dried preparations, fix the smear immediately in 95%
ethanol or fixative spray for Papanicolaou (Pap) staining.
◦ For wet fixation, promptly immerse the slides in a jar
containing 95% ethanol for Pap staining.
B) Staining
1. Pap Staining Protocol
◦ Ensure reagents are at the required concentration and
check expiration dates.
◦ Follow the laboratory's established protocol for Pap staining:
▪ Fixation in 95% ethanol (15-30 minutes)
▪ Harris Hematoxylin (5 minutes)
▪ Water rinse (1 minute)
▪ Differentiation in 0.5% hydrochloric acid in 70% ethanol
(10 seconds)
▪ Water rinse (1 minute)
▪ Blueing in Scott's tap water or ammonium hydroxide (1
minute)
▪ Orange G (OG-6) staining (2 minutes)
▪ Water rinse (30 seconds)
▪ Eosin Azure EA-50 or EA-65 staining (3-4 minutes)
▪ Water rinse (1 minute)
▪ Dehydration in ascending alcohol solutions (70%, 95%,
100% ethanol)
▪ Clearing in xylene or equivalent clearing agent.
▪ Mounting with a cover slip using a mounting medium.
C) Analysis
1. Microscopic Examination
◦ Use a microscope to systematically examine slides. Start
with low magnification (10x) to scan the entire slide, then
proceed to higher magnification (20x, 40x, or higher) for
detailed evaluation.
◦ Identify and document cell types, cellular arrangements,
presence of inflammation, microorganisms, or atypical/
malignant cells.
2. Documentation
◦ Record findings in the laboratory information system (LIS).
◦ Include detailed notes on all observed cellular abnormalities.
D) Quality Control
1. Internal Quality Control
◦ Ensure that all reagents and staining protocols comply with
quality control standards.
◦ Perform regular proficiency testing and peer review of slide
preparations.
◦ Document all quality control measures and any corrective
actions taken, including reruns if necessary.
2. Equipment Maintenance
◦ Perform routine maintenance and calibration of microscopes
and other equipment as per manufacturer’s guidelines.
◦ Document any malfunctions and repairs.
E) Reporting Results
1. Result Generation and Verification
◦ Review and verify all findings by a qualified pathologist.
◦ Compare results with known standards and controls to
ensure accuracy.
2. Result Reporting
◦ Enter final, verified results into the LIS with an appropriate
and detailed report.
◦ Ensure timely communication of critical results to the
ordering physician.
