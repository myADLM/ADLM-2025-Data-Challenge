CYTOLOGY, CEREBROSPINAL FLUID (CSF) Standard Operating
Procedure (SOP)
1. PURPOSE To outline the analytical process for cytology
examination of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) specimens to ensure
accurate and timely identification of cellular components,
including the detection of malignant cells, infectious agents, and
other diagnostic findings.
Responsibility:
• The cytologists and laboratory technologists are responsible for
processing, examining, and reporting CSF cytology results.
• The laboratory supervisor is responsible for overseeing the
procedure and ensuring compliance with this SOP.
1. SPECIMEN
• Preferred/acceptable: Freshly collected CSF specimens,
preferably in sterile containers, should be transported to the
laboratory immediately.
• Unacceptable: Specimens that are clotted, significantly
hemolyzed, or contain large air bubbles. Delayed transport or
improper storage may compromise specimen integrity.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Sterile containers for CSF collection
• Centrifuge
• Glass microscope slides
• Cytocentrifuge and cytospin funnels
• Staining reagents (e.g., Papanicolaou, Diff-Quik)
• Coverslips
• Microscope
• Gloves, lab coat, and other personal protective equipment (PPE)
1. PROCEDURE A) Specimen Preparation:
2. Upon receiving the CSF specimen, label it with the laboratory
accession number.
3. Ensure specimen is logged accurately in the laboratory
information system (LIS).
4. Review the requisition form and clinical history for relevant
patient information.
B) Cytocentrifugation:
1. Aliquot an appropriate volume (usually 1-2 mL) of CSF into a
cytospin funnel.
2. Centrifuge the sample using the cytocentrifuge at
recommended settings (e.g., 600-800 RPM for 5-10 minutes) to
create a monolayer of cells on the slide.
C) Slide Staining:
1. Stain the cytospin slides using Papanicolaou stain or Diff-Quik
stain. i. For Papanicolaou stain: - Fix the slide by immersing it in
95% ethanol for 15 minutes. - Stain using hematoxylin, OG-6,
and EA-50, following the manufacturer’s instructions. - Rinse
with tap water and dehydrate the slide through graded ethanol
solutions. - Clear in xylene and coverslip with a mounting
medium. ii. For Diff-Quik stain: - Fix the slide by immersing it in
a methanol-based fixative. - Stain using Diff-Quik solutions
(fixative, eosinophilic stain, basophilic stain), following
manufacturer instructions. - Rinse with distilled water and air
dry.
D) Microscopy Examination:
1. Examine the slides under the microscope for cellular elements
such as:
◦ Red and white blood cells
◦ Eosinophils, neutrophils, and other granulocytes
◦ Lymphocytes and macrophages
◦ Malignant cells
◦ Fungi, bacteria, or other infectious agents
Note: Conduct differential cell counts when appropriate.
2. Record observations, including the type and quantity of cells,
morphology, and any notable findings.
E) Quality Control:
1. Process control slides (e.g., known positive and negative
controls) to verify proper staining and cytocentrifuge operation.
2. Document quality control results and take corrective action
when necessary.
3. REPORTING RESULTS
4. Document findings in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
5. Generate a report including:
◦ Patient identification and clinical information
◦ Specimen adequacy
◦ Detailed description of cellular findings
◦ Diagnostic interpretation and comments
6. Cytologist reviews and signs the final report before releasing
the results to the clinician.
7. METHOD LIMITATIONS Refer to the manufacturer's insert and
guidelines for specific staining reagents and cytocentrifuge
settings to understand potential limitations and sources of error.
