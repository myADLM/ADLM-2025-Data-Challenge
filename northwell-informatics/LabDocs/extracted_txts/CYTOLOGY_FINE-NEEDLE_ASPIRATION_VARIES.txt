Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase of Generating Results for Cytology Fine-
Needle Aspiration (FNA) Samples
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the analytical procedures for
processing, examining, and reporting results of Cytology Fine-Needle
Aspiration (FNA) samples in the cytology laboratory. This protocol
ensures consistency, accuracy, and reliability of results generated for
FNA samples.
Responsibility:
1.1 Cytotechnologists and pathologists are responsible for performing
the processing, examination, interpretation, and reporting of FNA
samples according to this SOP. 1.2 All laboratory staff members are
responsible for maintaining the integrity of samples and equipment
and for ensuring that procedures are followed.
1. DEFINITION
Fine-Needle Aspiration (FNA) is a procedure used to obtain a sample
of cells from a lump or mass in the body. FNA samples include, but
are not limited to, aspirates from lymph nodes, thyroid, breast, liver,
and other tissues.
1. SPECIMEN ACCEPTANCE
3.1 Specimen Requirements:
3.1.1 Accepted Specimens: a. Slides with aspirated material
smeared, fixed, and properly labeled. b. Aspirated material collected
in a fixative solution such as Cytolyt. c. Adequate and properly
labeled container with transport media.
3.1.2 Unacceptable Specimens: a. Unlabeled or improperly labeled
specimens. b. Specimens leaking or improperly sealed. c. Specimens
without a proper requisition form.
3.2 Specimen Storage: a. Store collected material slides at room
temperature. b. Store specimens in fixative solutions as per the
manufacturer's instructions.
1. PROCEDURE
4.1 Specimen Processing:
4.1.1 Fixation: a. Air-dried specimens for Diff-Quik and Romanowsky
stains. b. Alcohol-fixed specimens for Papanicolaou (Pap) stain.
4.1.2 Staining: a. Air-Dried Smears: i. Perform Diff-Quik staining. ii.
Dehydrate, clear, and mount the slides. b. Alcohol-Fixed Smears: i.
Perform Pap staining. ii. Dehydrate, clear, and mount the slides.
4.1.3 Preparation of Cell Block: a. Collect remaining aspirate material
in Cytolyt solution. b. Centrifuge to form a cell pellet. c. Process cell
pellet for paraffin embedding and sectioning.
4.2 Microscopic Examination:
4.2.1 Screening by Cytotechnologist: a. Using a light microscope,
perform a thorough examination of the smeared slides and cell block
sections. b. Mark all areas of interest for pathologist review. c.
Document findings in the laboratory information system (LIS).
4.2.2 Review by Pathologist: a. Review all marked slides and cell
blocks. b. Provide a final diagnosis or recommendation for further
studies if necessary (e.g. Immunohistochemistry, molecular testing).
4.3 Quality Control:
4.3.1 Quality Control for Stains: a. Run a known control slide with
each staining batch. b. Document stain quality in the QC log and take
corrective actions if the stain fails.
4.3.2 Location and Examination Quality: a. Conduct monthly peer
reviews of a random selection of examined slides. b. Document and
discuss discrepancies and address any issues identified.
4.4 Reporting Results:
4.4.1 Result Documentation: a. Record cytotechnologist’s
observations in LIS. b. Document the pathologist's final interpretation
in LIS.
4.4.2 Result Verification: a. Verify all entries in the LIS for accuracy
and completeness. b. Ensure all pertinent clinical and specimen
information is included in the report.
4.4.3 Result Communication: a. Ensure that critical results are
communicated to the ordering physician promptly. b. Follow up with a
written report in accordance with laboratory policy.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS:
Results are based on diagnostic criteria and do not follow traditional
reference intervals. Diagnostic categories may include, but are not
limited to, non-diagnostic, benign, atypical, suspicious for malignancy,
and malignant.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
Documentation and interpretation limitations may occur due to
inadequate sample size, poor quality of smear preparation, or
suboptimal fixation and staining.
1. REFERENCES:
Use relevant medical and technical literature, staining protocols, and
cytology textbooks for reference and further guidance in FNA sample
analysis.
By following this SOP, the analytical process for Cytology Fine-
Needle Aspiration samples will be standardized, ensuring high-quality
and consistent results for patient care.
