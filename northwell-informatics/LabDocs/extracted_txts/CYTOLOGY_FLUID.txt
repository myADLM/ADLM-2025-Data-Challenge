Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Cytology Fluid
Analysis
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedures for the receipt, preparation, staining,
examination, and reporting of fluid specimens for Cytology analysis.
The objective is to provide clear guidelines to ensure consistent and
accurate results.
1. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel who are involved in
the processing and analysis of fluid specimens for cytology.
1. RESPONSIBILITIES
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for following this
procedure. All staff must adhere to these guidelines to ensure the
integrity and accuracy of cytological analyses.
1. SPECIMENS
Acceptable Specimens:
• Pleural Fluid
• Peritoneal Fluid
• Pericardial Fluid
• Synovial Fluid
• Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF)
• Urine
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens that are improperly labeled
• Specimens that are not received in appropriate, leak-proof
containers
• Specimens that are received beyond the specified time frame for
processing without proper preservation
1. MATERIALS AND REAGENTS
• Centrifuge
• Cytospin or Smear preparation materials
• Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) stains
• Papanicolaou (Pap) Stain
• Coverslips
• Mounting Medium
• Slides and slide racks
• Microscopy supplies
1. PROCEDURE
6.1 Receipt and Accessioning
1. Confirm the patient information and specimen details match the
requisition form.
2. Label the specimen container and worksheet with the patient's
unique identifier.
3. Record the date and time of receipt in the laboratory.
6.2 Fluid Specimen Preparation
1. Mix the specimen gently to ensure homogeneity.
2. Measure the total volume of the fluid specimen.
3. Aliquot a portion of the fluid for cytocentrifugation or direct
smear preparation, based on specimen type and volume.
6.3 Cytocentrifugation
1. Prepare cytocentrifuge funnels and slides according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
2. Pipette a standardized volume of the specimen into the funnel.
3. Centrifuge at the recommended settings (e.g., 1500 rpm for 10
minutes).
4. Remove the slide and allow it to air-dry or fix it immediately if
required by the staining protocol.
6.4 Smear Preparation (if applicable)
1. Place a drop of the fluid specimen onto a clean slide.
2. Use a spreader slide to create a uniform smear.
3. Air-dry or fix the smear immediately.
6.5 Staining
1. Follow the specific staining protocols for Hematoxylin and Eosin
(H&E) and Papanicolaou (Pap) stains.
◦ H&E Staining: i. Deparaffinize the slide if necessary. ii. Stain
slides sequentially with hematoxylin, differentiate, bluing
reagent, and eosin with washes in between.
◦ Pap Staining: i. Fix the slides in 95% ethanol or cytological
fixative. ii. Stain the slides with sequential applications of
nuclear and cytoplasmic dyes.
2. Wash and dehydrate the stained slides.
3. Apply coverslips using a mounting medium.
6.6 Microscopy and Evaluation
1. Examine the stained slides under a microscope.
2. Assess the slides for cellularity, presence of neoplastic cells,
reactive changes, inflammation, and any other pathological
findings.
3. Document findings according to standardized reporting criteria.
6.7 Documentation and Reporting
1. Enter the results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
accurately.
2. Review and verify the report.
3. Deliver the final report to the referring physician or department
according to laboratory protocol.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform daily quality control of staining reagents and
cytocentrifuge operation.
• Ensure that control slides are included in each batch of staining
runs to monitor the quality of staining.
• Document all quality control activities and perform corrective
actions if any deviation occurs.

1. REVIEW
This SOP will be reviewed annually or as needed based on changes
in procedures or standards.
