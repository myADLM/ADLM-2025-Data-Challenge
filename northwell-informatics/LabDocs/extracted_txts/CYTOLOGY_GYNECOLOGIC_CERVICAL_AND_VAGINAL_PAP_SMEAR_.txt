STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE: ANALYTICAL PHASE OF
GENERATING RESULTS FOR CYTOLOGY, GYNECOLOGIC,
CERVICAL AND VAGINAL (PAP SMEAR)
1. PURPOSE
This SOP defines the procedure for the processing, staining, and
microscopic analysis of gynecologic cytology specimens
(Papanicolaou (Pap) smear) to ensure consistency, accuracy, and
reliability of test results.
Responsibility:
Designated cytotechnologists and pathologists are responsible for
processing, staining, screening, and interpreting Pap smears, as
defined in this procedure.
2. DEFINITIONS
Gynecologic Cytology Samples: Specimens collected from the cervix
and vagina for the purpose of screening and diagnosing cellular
abnormalities.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Microscope
• Cytology Staining Rack
• Papanicolaou stain solutions (Hematoxylin, OG-6, EA-50 or
EA-65)
• Reagent alcohols (95%, 70%, and 50% ethanol)
• Xylene or xylene substitute
• Glass slides and coverslips
• Spray fixative or 95% ethanol
• Immersion Oil
• Slide Storage
• Laboratory Information System (LIS)
4. SPECIMEN PREPARATION
4.1. Specimen Reception:
1. Verify specimen identity: Confirm that the sample is labeled
correctly and matches the accompanying requisition form.
2. Documentation: Log the specimen with relevant details into the
Laboratory Information System (LIS).
4.2. Fixation:
1. Immediately after specimen collection, immerse the slides into
95% ethanol or spray with a cytological fixative to preserve
cellular morphology.
2. Note: Fixed slides should be stored in an ethanol-filled
container until staining, if not processed immediately.
5. STAINING PROCEDURE
5.1. Pap Staining Method:
1. Hydration:
◦ Immerse slides in descending alcohol concentrations (95%,
70%, and 50% ethanol, 1 minute each).
2. Hematoxylin Staining:
◦ Stain in Hematoxylin solution for 2-3 minutes.
◦ Rinse in distilled water.
3. Bluiing:
◦ Immerse slides in Scott’s tap water or Lithium carbonate
solution for 1-2 minutes.
4. Dehydration:
◦ Dehydrate immediately through an ascending series of
alcohols (70%, 95% ethanol, 1 minute each).
5. Counterstaining:
◦ Stain in OG-6 solution for 1 minute.
◦ Rinse briefly in 95% ethanol.
◦ Stain in EA-50 or EA-65 solution for 1-2 minutes.
6. Dehydration:
◦ Dehydrate through two changes each of 95% ethanol and
absolute ethanol (1 minute each).
7. Clearing:
◦ Clear in xylene or xylene substitute (1 minute or until slides
are transparent).
8. Mounting:
◦ Mount cover slips using synthetic mounting media.
6. MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION
6.1. Screening:
1. Initial screening is performed by a cytotechnologist.
◦ Use a microscope with appropriate magnification.
◦ Record observed cellular abnormalities according to
established cytological criteria.
6.2. Evaluation:
1. After screening, abnormal or equivocal cases are referred to a
pathologist for final review and diagnosis.
2. Pathologist evaluation includes:
◦ Confirming cytotechnologist findings.
◦ Categorizing findings based on the Bethesda System for
reporting cervical cytology.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Perform routine quality control checks for staining procedures
and microscope calibration.
2. Maintain internal and external quality assessment programs to
evaluate the accuracy and reliability of cytotechnologist and
pathologist interpretations.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Document findings in the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
with complete details:
◦ Patient’s demographic information.
◦ Specimens’ adequacy.
◦ Significant cellular findings.
◦ Diagnostic conclusion based on the Bethesda System.
2. Report generation:
◦ Ensure that the final report is reviewed and signed off by the
pathologist.
3. Critical findings communication:
◦ Communicate any critical results to the referring physician
immediately, following the laboratory’s critical value policy.
9. MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS
1. Retain microscope slides and documentation for a period in
accordance with CLIA guidelines and local regulations.
2. Archive finalized reports in the LIS with easy retrieval options
for future reference.
