Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Generating Results for
Cytology, Liquid-Based Pap Test
1. PURPOSE
To provide a detailed and standardized procedure for the analytical
phase of generating results for cytology using liquid-based Pap tests.
This SOP ensures consistent, accurate, and reliable test preparation,
examination, and reporting in compliance with CLIA guidelines.
Responsibility:
• Cytotechnologists and Pathologists: Perform the analysis,
interpretation, and reporting of results.
• Laboratory Supervisors: Ensure all procedures comply with
established guidelines and oversee quality control.
• Laboratory Technicians: Assist in specimen preparation and
maintain equipment as required.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen Type:
• Cervical cell samples collected in a liquid-based cytology
preservative.
Specimen Stability:
• Specimens in preservative medium are stable at room
temperature for up to three weeks from the date of collection.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Liquid-based cytology collection medium and vials
• Automated Liquid-Based Cytology Processor (e.g., ThinPrep or
SurePath)
• Microscope and necessary staining reagents (e.g., Papanicolaou
stain)
• Glass slides
• Forceps and applicator sticks
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
• Quality control materials
4. PROCEDURE
A) SPECIMEN PREPARATION
1. Reception and Accessioning:
◦ Ensure all collected specimens are properly labeled with
patient information and received with corresponding
requisition forms.
◦ Log and verify specimen receipt in the laboratory
information system (LIS).
2. Liquid-Based Cytology Processing:
◦ Vortex the specimen vial to ensure cellular suspension.
◦ Using an automated liquid-based cytology processor,
transfer the specimen to a glass slide, following the
manufacturer's instructions.
◦ Label each prepared slide with the corresponding patient
identifier.
B) STAINING PROCESS
1. Slide Fixation:
◦ Fix the slides immediately after preparation by immersing in
95% ethanol or using an ethanol spray fixative.
2. Staining:
◦ Perform Papanicolaou staining as follows:
▪ Hydrate slides through graded alcohols to distilled water.
▪ Stain with Harris hematoxylin for nuclear detail.
▪ Differentiate in a weak acid alcohol.
▪ Blue in running water.
▪ Counterstain with Orange G6 and EA50 or EA65.
▪ Dehydrate through graded alcohols, clear in xylene, and
coverslip using a mounting medium.
C) MICROSCOPE EXAMINATION
1. Screening by Cytotechnologists:
◦ Using a microscope, systematically examine the entire slide
starting with low power (10x) and then proceed to high
power (40x) for detailed evaluation.
◦ Assess for cellular adequacy, presence of infectious agents,
dysplasia, or neoplastic changes.
2. Cytopathologist Review:
◦ Any slides indicative of atypical findings or abnormalities
must be reviewed and confirmed by a cytopathologist.
D) QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE
1. Quality Control:
◦ Include known positive and negative control slides with each
batch of tests to validate staining and preparation
consistency.
◦ Review a percentage of negative slides to ensure no
diagnostic inaccuracies.
2. Equipment Maintenance:
◦ Follow the manufacturer’s guidelines for routine
maintenance of the cytology processor and staining
equipment.
◦ Document and log maintenance activities and any corrective
actions taken.
5. RESULT REPORTING
1. Result Documentation:
◦ Document test findings in the LIS, recording cellular
observations and any diagnostic impressions.
◦ Utilize the Bethesda System for Reporting Cervical Cytology
for standardized result reporting.
2. Review and Verification:
◦ Ensure results are reviewed by a certified pathologist before
release.
◦ Address any discrepancies or uncertainties through
additional review or repeat testing if necessary.
3. Communication of Results:
◦ Results must be communicated to the ordering physician
promptly, including detailed diagnostic findings and any
additional recommendations for follow-up.
6. REFERENCE RANGES AND LIMITATIONS
• Reference Intervals: Normal, atypical, suspicious, and malignant
findings based on cytological criteria.
• Method Limitations: Potential for sampling errors, inadequate
cellularity, and technical artifacts.

This procedure is to be reviewed and updated periodically, ensuring
continued compliance with current standards and technological
advancements. All staff must be trained and competency-checked
annually to maintain adherence to these SOPs.
