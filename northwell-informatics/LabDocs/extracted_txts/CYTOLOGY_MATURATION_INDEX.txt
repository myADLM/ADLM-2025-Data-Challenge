1. PURPOSE
To describe the procedure for the analytical phase of generating
cytology maturation index results, ensuring accuracy and consistency
of results in accordance with established protocols.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel involved in the
analysis of cytology specimens for the purpose of determining the
maturation index.
3. RESPONSIBILITIES
• Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for the accurate
performance of the cytology maturation index procedure.
• Laboratory supervisors are responsible for ensuring that all staff
members adhere to this protocol and for addressing any
discrepancies or issues that arise during the analytical process.
4. DEFINITIONS
• Maturation Index (MI): A cytological assessment of the
maturation of epithelial cells, typically used in evaluating hormonal
influence on the vaginal or other mucosal surfaces.
• Specimen: Cytological sample collected and prepared for
analysis.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Light Microscope
• Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) stained slides or Papanicolaou-
stained slides
• Immersion Oil
• Cytology Staining Reagents
• Staining Racks and Solutions
• Cytology Transport and Storage Equipment
• Laboratory Record Forms and Logbooks
• Biohazard Disposal Containers
6. PROCEDURE
6.1 Preparation of Samples
1. Reception and Accessioning:
◦ Confirm specimen identity with requisition form.
◦ Label slides with unique accession numbers.
◦ Ensure proper fixation of the specimen.
2. Staining of Slides:
◦ Process cytology specimens using standardized H&E or
Papanicolaou staining techniques.
◦ Ensure proper differentiation and dehydration of stained
slides.
6.2 Microscopic Examination
1. Microscope Calibration:
◦ Ensure that the light microscope is properly calibrated prior
to examination.
◦ Adjust the microscope settings as required for optimal
viewing of cellular details using appropriate magnification.
2. Slide Examination:
◦ Apply immersion oil to the slide.
◦ Carefully examine the entire smear at appropriate
magnification.
◦ Systematically assess for the presence and distribution of
different epithelial cell types (parabasal, intermediate, and
superficial cells).
3. Identification of Cells:
◦ Identify and count a minimum of 100 relevant epithelial cells.
◦ Record the number of each type of epithelial cell observed.
6.3 Calculating the Maturation Index
1. Formula for Maturation Index:
◦ Calculate the Maturation Index as follows: ( \text{MI} =
[(\text{Number of Superficial Cells} \times 100) / \text{Total
Number of Cells Counted}] : [(\text{Number of Intermediate
Cells} \times 100) / \text{Total Number of Cells Counted}] :
[(\text{Number of Parabasal Cells} \times 100) / \text{Total
Number of Cells Counted}] )
◦ Report the Maturation Index in the format:
Superficial:Intermediate:Parabasal.
6.4 Quality Control
1. Internal Quality Control:
◦ Perform internal QC checks by analyzing control slides with
known Maturation Index values daily.
◦ Record and review QC results, taking corrective actions if
results deviate from expected values.
2. Proficiency Testing:
◦ Participate in external proficiency testing programs to
ensure accuracy and comparability of Maturation Index
results.
◦ Document any corrective action taken as a result of
proficiency testing outcomes.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Documentation:
◦ Document Maturation Index results in the laboratory
information system (LIS) or appropriate logbooks.
◦ Ensure results are accurately transmitted to the clinician or
requesting entity.
2. Reference Ranges:
◦ Provide reference ranges or interpretive commentary if
applicable (e.g., ranges indicative of different phases of the
menstrual cycle or post-menopausal status).
7.1 Review and Verification
1. Technologist Review:
◦ Technologist must review and verify all results before they
are released.
2. Supervisor Verification:
◦ Supervisor must verify a random selection of results to
ensure compliance with protocol.
8. SAFETY AND WASTE MANAGEMENT
1. Safety Precautions:
◦ Follow universal precautions and wear appropriate personal
protective equipment (PPE) including gloves and lab coat.
◦ Properly handle and dispose of all biohazardous waste in
accordance with institutional policies and regulatory
requirements.
2. Waste Disposal:
◦ Dispose of used staining reagents and slides in designated
biohazard containers.
◦ Follow guidelines for disposal of chemical waste in
accordance with local regulations.
9. RECORD KEEPING
• Maintain records of all specimens received, processed, and
analyzed.
• Document QC activities, proficiency testing, and any deviations
from standard procedures.
