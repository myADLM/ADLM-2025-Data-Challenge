Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase of Generating Results for Cytology Non-
Gynecologic Specimens
1. PURPOSE
This procedure outlines the analytical steps required for generating
results for non-gynecologic cytology specimens. The procedure
ensures the accuracy, reliability, and timeliness of results. The steps
involve preparation, staining, microscopic examination, interpretation,
and reporting by qualified personnel.
Responsibility: Designated cytotechnologists and pathologists are
responsible for performing the analytical tasks outlined in this
procedure. It is the responsibility of all staff to ensure the integrity of
cytology specimens, proper documentation, and timely processing of
results.
2. DEFINITIONS
Non-Gynecologic Cytology Specimens: These include, but are not
limited to, body fluids (e.g., pleural fluid, ascitic fluid, cerebrospinal
fluid), urine, brushings, washings, fine needle aspirations (FNA) from
non-gynecologic sites, and any other non-gynecologic samples
requiring cytological examination.
3. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Preparation
1. Fixation: Upon receipt, all cytology specimens must be
preserved using appropriate fixatives. For liquid-based
specimens, immediate fixation with equal parts alcohol or
specialized cytology fixatives (e.g., Saccomanno's fixative) is
recommended. Slide preparations from fine needle aspirations
(FNA) should be fixed immediately by air drying or immersion in
alcohol.
2. Concentration: Concentrate the specimen using
centrifugation, cytocentrifugation, or filtration techniques as
appropriate to ensure adequate cellularity.
3. Slide Preparation: Prepare slides according to the specimen
type:
◦ Centrifugation Method: Centrifuge body fluids at
1500-2000 RPM for 10 minutes. Apply the sediment onto
slides using a cytocentrifuge.
◦ Smear/Spread Method: Spread brushings or aspirates onto
glass slides evenly using a syringe or spatula.
◦ Liquid-Based Cytology: For liquid specimens, prepare
ThinPrep or SurePath slides as preferred.
B. Staining
1. Papanicolaou Stain: Preferred for most non-gynecologic
cytology specimens to highlight cellular morphology, nuclear
detail, and cytoplasmic characteristics.
◦ Procedure: Follow standardized steps for Papanicolaou
staining, ensuring adequate dehydration, staining, and
clearing. Use appropriate controls to validate staining
quality.
◦ Alternative Stains: If specific cellular features (e.g., mucin,
microorganisms) require identification, consider using
additional stains such as Giemsa, Diff-Quik, or special stains
specific for the suspected pathologic process.
C. Microscopic Examination
1. Initial Screening: Perform an initial microscopic screening of
the prepared slides to identify areas of interest, cellular
abnormalities, and artifact assessment.
◦ Objective Lenses: Use low power (4x, 10x) for scanning
and high power (40x, 100x oil immersion) for detailed
examination.
2. Cellular Analysis: Examine cellular features systematically
and categorize findings into benign, atypical, suspicious, or
malignant.
◦ Diagnostic Criteria: Use standardized criteria for cellular
morphology when determining the final diagnosis.
3. Documentation: Record findings, including cell count
estimates, dominant cell types, presence of infection,
inflammation, neoplastic changes, and other pertinent details.
D. Interpretation and Reporting
1. Interpretation: Cytotechnologists and pathologists should
interpret findings collaboratively, especially when cell
abnormalities are identified. Use consensus for final diagnosis
for atypical or suspicious cases.
◦ Quality Control: Verify representative slide areas and
review with a second cytologist/pathologist if necessary.
2. Reporting Results:
◦ Format: Use standardized reporting templates to ensure
uniformity. Include specimen type, patient identification,
examination method, results summary, detailed
interpretation, and pathologist/cytotechnologist signature.
◦ Electronic Reporting: Enter results into the Laboratory
Information System (LIS), ensuring timely reporting and
notification of critical results as per laboratory policy.
◦ Documentation: Maintain all records following laboratory
protocols to ensure traceability and compliance with
regulatory requirements.
Quality Control:
1. Daily Controls: Ensure all microscopes and staining
equipment are functioning correctly. Perform daily quality
controls using known positive and negative slides.
2. Proficiency Testing: Participate in external cytology
proficiency testing programs periodically to validate diagnostic
accuracy.
3. Review and Audits: Regularly review random samples and
conduct audits to ensure consistency and adherence to
protocols.

Refer to current textbooks on cytology, CAP guidelines, and
laboratory-specific manuals for detailed information on cytological
examination techniques and diagnostic criteria.
4. REVIEW AND REVISION
This SOP is to be reviewed annually or as needed due to procedural
changes. Updates and revisions must be documented with version
control.
