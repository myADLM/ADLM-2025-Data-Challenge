1. PURPOSE
To provide detailed instructions for the proper handling, processing,
and analysis of sputum cytology specimens to ensure accurate and
reliable results.
Responsibility:
Cytotechnologists and laboratory technicians are responsible for
processing, analyzing, and documenting the results of sputum
cytology specimens according to this procedure. Supervisors and
senior laboratory staff are responsible for oversight and ensuring
compliance with the procedure.
1. DEFINITIONS
Cytology: The study of cells from tissues and fluids of the body to
diagnose diseases including cancers, infections, and inflammatory
conditions. Sputum: A mixture of saliva and mucus coughed up from
the respiratory tract, often used for diagnostic purposes in cytology.
1. PROCEDURE
Specimen Requirements and Stability
Preferred/acceptable specimen:
• Early morning sputum is preferred, ideally collected on three
consecutive days.
• Freshly expectorated sputum, container must be labeled with
patient identification, date, and time of collection.
• Specimens should be received in the laboratory as soon as
possible after collection, preferably within 2 hours. If a delay is
unavoidable, refrigerate the specimen at 2-8°C and process within
24 hours.
Unacceptable specimens:
• Specimens that are not properly labeled.
• Specimens contaminated with blood (unless this is specifically
indicated for diagnostic purposes).
Specimen Processing:
1. Macroscopic Examination
• Examine the sputum specimen for volume, consistency, and color.
• Record observations in the laboratory information system (LIS).
1. Fixation
• Fix the sputum specimen by adding an equal volume of 50%
ethanol or a suitable cytology fixative.
• Mix thoroughly and leave for 30 minutes to allow proper fixation of
cells.
1. Preparation of Slides
• Pour the fixed specimen into a clean glass conical tube.
• Centrifuge at 1500 rpm for 10 minutes to concentrate the cells.
• Carefully decant the supernatant, leaving the cell pellet.
• Resuspend the cell pellet in a small volume of fixative (~1 mL).
• Prepare multiple smears by placing a drop of the resuspended
pellet onto clean glass slides.
• Spread the drop evenly using another slide or a cover slip.
• Air-dry or fix the slides immediately by immersing them in 95%
ethanol for 5-10 minutes.
1. Staining
• Stain the prepared slides with the Papanicolaou (PAP) stain or
Romanowsky stain according to standard protocols. (Refer to the
detailed SOP for PAP and Romanowsky staining procedures)
1. Microscopic Examination
• Examine the stained slides under a light microscope.
• Evaluate the slides for cellularity, morphology, and presence of
atypical or malignant cells.
• Quantify the presence of microorganisms, inflammatory cells, and
other pathological findings.
1. Quality Control
• Include control slides with known cytological features in each
batch of slides processed and stained.
• Review control slides to ensure the quality and accuracy of
staining and preparation.
• Document any discrepancies and take corrective actions as
necessary.
1. Reporting Results
• Document and record all findings in the laboratory information
system (LIS).
• Use standardized terminology and criteria for reporting cytological
findings, as outlined in the laboratory’s reporting guidelines.
• Review and verify results by a confirming cytopathologist, if
required.
• Report findings to the requesting physician or appropriate
healthcare provider according to established protocols.
1. Critical Values
• Report any findings suggestive of malignancy or significant
infection to the attending physician immediately.
• Document the communication of critical results according to the
laboratory’s critical value policy.
1. Disposal of Specimens and Materials
• Dispose of any remaining sputum specimens and used
consumables (e.g., slides, coverslips) according to the
laboratory’s biohazard waste disposal policy.
