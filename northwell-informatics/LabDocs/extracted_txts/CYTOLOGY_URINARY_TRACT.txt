CYTOLOGY, URINARY TRACT
1. PURPOSE
This protocol provides guidelines for the analytical phase of
generating results for Cytology, Urinary Tract. It ensures consistent,
accurate, and timely analysis and reporting of cytological findings in
urinary tract specimens.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of trained cytotechnologists and pathologists to
analyze and interpret urinary cytology specimens accurately.
Laboratory supervisors are responsible for ensuring the protocol is
followed, monitoring quality control, and addressing any
discrepancies or issues that arise.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND ACCEPTABILITY
Preferred/Acceptable Specimen Types:
• Voided urine collected in a clean container
• Catheterized urine specimen
• Urine samples preserved in cytology fixative, such as
Saccomanno's fixative
• Specimens must be collected and processed promptly to avoid
cellular degradation.
Unacceptable Specimen Types:
• Specimens arriving more than 24 hours after collection without
preservative
• Specimens contaminated with stool or other foreign materials
• Specimens with an insufficient volume for analysis (minimum 10
mL required)
• Specimens with no collection date/time indicated
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Microscope with appropriate magnification (10x, 40x, 100x)
• Cytocentrifuge or standard centrifuge
• Glass slides
• Cytology fixatives
• Staining solutions (e.g., Papanicolaou stain)
• Coverslips
• Immersion oil
1. PROCEDURE
Specimen Preparation:
• Upon receipt, specimen details must be verified against the
requisition form
• Aliquot specimen into cytocentrifuge funnels or centrifuge tubes
• Centrifuge at recommended speeds (typically 2000 RPM for 5-10
minutes) to concentrate cellular material
• Prepare slides by transferring concentrated material onto glass
slides
• Fix slides immediately using cytology fixatives to preserve cellular
integrity
Staining:
• Perform Papanicolaou staining according to the laboratory
protocol:
1. Fix slide in alcohol-based fixative
2. Apply hematoxylin stain for nuclear detail
3. Rinse and apply sequential washes with bluing agent,
alcohol, and eosin Azure stain for cytoplasmic detail
4. Dehydrate slides through graded alcohols and xylene
Microscopic Examination:
• Evaluate slides under the microscope at low power initially to
scan for areas of interest
• Switch to higher magnification for detailed examination of cellular
morphology
• Note any significant findings: atypical cells, malignancy indicators,
infection, inflammation, or other pathological changes
Documentation and Reporting:
• Record findings systematically in the laboratory information
system (LIS)
• Ensure all relevant details (patient identifiers, type of specimen,
cellular findings) are documented comprehensively
• Pathologists should review slides and confirm preliminary findings
• Final reports should be generated and reviewed, ensuring
accuracy before releasing to the healthcare provider
1. QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE
Internal Quality Control:
• Include positive and negative control slides with each batch of
stains to verify staining quality and accuracy
• Regularly review staining protocols and update as necessary to
maintain high quality results
• Perform periodic proficiency testing and compare results among
cytologists to ensure consistency
Equipment Maintenance:
• Calibrate and maintain microscopy and centrifugation equipment
regularly
• Replace cytology fixatives and stains according to manufacturer
guidelines and internal quality control standards
