Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Cytology Washing Analysis
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the procedures for processing, analyzing, and
reporting cytology washings to ensure accurate and timely results.
This includes bronchial washings, peritoneal washings, and other
similar specimens.
Responsibility:
• Trained laboratory personnel are responsible for processing
specimens and conducting the analysis.
• The laboratory supervisor ensures adherence to this SOP,
conducts quality checks, and addresses any issues that arise.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/Acceptable:
• Freshly collected wash specimens transported to the laboratory
immediately after collection.
• Containers should be properly labeled with patient identification,
collection date, and time.
• Specimens should be collected in sterile, leak-proof containers.
Unacceptable:
• Specimens collected in non-sterile or compromised containers.
• Specimens without proper identification.
• Specimens not transported to the laboratory within 12 hours of
collection without refrigeration.
1. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• Cytospin centrifuge
• Microscope slides
• Fixative solution (e.g., 95% ethanol or equivalent fixative)
• Staining reagents (e.g., Papanicolaou stain, Diff-Quik)
• Cover slips
• Cytology brushes
• Sterile pipettes and containers
1. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Preparation:
1. Upon receiving the specimen, check for proper labeling and
container integrity.
2. Record the specimen details in the laboratory information
system (LIS).
3. Mix the specimen gently to ensure homogeneity.
4. Centrifuge the specimen at 600-800 RCF for 10 minutes to
concentrate the cells at the bottom of the tube.
B. Slide Preparation:
1. Using a sterile pipette, transfer the cell pellet from the bottom of
the centrifuge tube to the cytospin chamber.
2. Spin at 1000 RCF for 5 minutes to deposit the cells onto
microscope slides.
3. Remove the slides carefully from the cytospin chamber.
4. Immediately fix the slides in a fixative solution for at least 15
minutes.
C. Staining:
1. After fixation, stain the slides using the Papanicolaou or Diff-
Quik staining protocols as outlined in the respective staining
procedure.
2. Rinse slides gently with distilled water after each staining step
to avoid residual stain and ensure clear visualization.
3. Allow slides to air dry completely.
D. Microscopic Examination:
1. Examine the stained slides under a microscope using low,
medium, and high power to assess cellular morphology.
2. Look for the presence of atypical cells, inflammatory cells, and
any pathological changes.
3. Capture and record any significant findings through digital
imaging or notation.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
5. Perform daily instrument checks on the cytospin centrifuge to
ensure proper functioning.
6. Rotate the use of fresh fixatives and staining reagents regularly
to prevent deterioration.
7. Include a positive control slide with known cellular composition
to validate staining quality for each batch of slides processed.
8. Document and review all quality control measures in the quality
control log.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
Prepare the final report with detailed findings, including any
abnormalities observed. The report must include:
• Patient identification
• Specimen type and source
• Date and time of collection and processing
• Description of cellular findings (e.g., normal, atypical, malignant)
• Pathologist or cytotechnologist review and signature
Transmit verified results to the requesting physician through the LIS,
ensure confidentiality, and follow HIPAA guidelines.
1. REFERENCES
List relevant scientific literature, manufacturer instructions for
reagents, and internal laboratory guidelines.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Discuss any known limitations related to specimen quality, staining
variability, and potential sources of error in microscopic examination.
1. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS
Adhere to proper biosafety protocols:
• Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) including
gloves, lab coat, and eye protection.
• Handle all specimens as potentially infectious.
• Dispose of all biohazardous waste according to laboratory waste
disposal guidelines.
Review and update the SOP annually or when changes in
procedures and regulations occur.
