Cytomegalovirus (CMV) Antibodies, IgG, Serum
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is to
outline the process for performing the CMV Antibodies, IgG test on
serum specimens. This test is intended to detect the presence of
Cytomegalovirus IgG antibodies in human serum, which helps
determine past or present infection with CMV.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory personnel to follow
this SOP as described to ensure accurate and reliable test results.
Supervisors are responsible for ensuring all staff are adequately
trained and adhere to these procedures. It is also the responsibility of
personnel to identify and document any deviations or issues
encountered during testing and inform the supervisors immediately.
1. DEFINITIONS
CMV: Cytomegalovirus IgG: Immunoglobulin G SOP: Standard
Operating Procedure
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
4.1 Equipment:
• Centrifuge
• Incubator
• Microplate reader
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Vortex mixer
4.2 Reagents:
• CMV IgG antibody assay kit (specific brand details are referenced
in the package insert)
• Controls (positive and negative)
• Calibrators
• Wash buffer
• Substrate solution
• Stop solution
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
5.1 Specimen: Serum 5.2 Volume: Minimum of 500 μL serum 5.3
Collection: Use standard venipuncture techniques. 5.4 Stability:
Serum stability at 2-8°C for up to 7 days. For longer storage, freeze
at -20°C or below. Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
1. PROCEDURE
6.1 Preparation:
• Allow serum specimens and controls to reach room temperature
before analysis.
• Ensure all equipment is calibrated and functioning properly.
6.2 Assay Procedure:
1. Label microplate wells for standards, controls, and samples.
2. Add 100 μL of diluted standards, controls, and patient
specimens into appropriate wells.
3. Incubate the plate at 37°C for 30 minutes.
4. Wash the wells 3 times with 300 μL wash buffer.
5. Add 100 μL of enzyme conjugate to each well.
6. Incubate the plate at room temperature (20-25°C) for 30
minutes.
7. Wash the wells 3 times with 300 μL wash buffer.
8. Add 100 μL of substrate solution to each well.
9. Incubate the plate in the dark at room temperature (20-25°C)
for 15 minutes.
10. Add 100 μL of stop solution to each well.
11. Read the optical density (OD) at 450 nm with a microplate
reader within 30 minutes of adding the stop solution.
6.3 Calculation and Reporting:
• Calculate the mean OD value for each control and patient
specimen.
• Construct the standard curve by plotting the OD values of the
standards against their concentrations.
• Determine the concentration of CMV IgG antibodies in patient
specimens from the standard curve.
• Report results as positive or negative based on the cut-off value
provided in the assay kit insert.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
7.1 Run controls with each assay to ensure the accuracy and
reliability of results:
• Negative control should fall within the specified range.
• Positive control should fall within the specified range. 7.2 If
controls do not meet the acceptable range, the assay is
considered invalid, and patient results cannot be reported.
Investigate, troubleshoot, and repeat the assay if necessary. 7.3
Document all quality control results and corrective actions taken.
1. LIMITATIONS
8.1 Results from this assay should be used in conjunction with
clinical evaluation and other diagnostic procedures. 8.2 False-
negative results may occur if the patient is in the early stages of
infection, as it may take several weeks for detectable levels of IgG
antibodies to appear. 8.3 Cross-reactivity with other herpesviruses
may occur, potentially leading to false-positive results.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
9.1 Positive result: Indicates past CMV infection and the presence of
IgG antibodies. 9.2 Negative result: Indicates no detectable IgG
antibodies to CMV, suggesting no prior exposure or early infection.

1. DOCUMENTATION
11.1 Record all patient test results in the laboratory information
system (LIS). 11.2 Document all quality control results and any
corrective actions taken in the appropriate logs.
