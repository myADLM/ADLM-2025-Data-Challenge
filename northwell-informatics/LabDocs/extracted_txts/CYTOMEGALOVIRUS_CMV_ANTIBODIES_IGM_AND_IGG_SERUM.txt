Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for CMV Antibodies, IgM, and
IgG, Serum
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for testing and generating
accurate and reliable results for Cytomegalovirus (CMV) antibodies,
including both IgM and IgG, in serum samples.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory personnel to
perform the analysis of CMV antibodies (IgM and IgG) and ensure
the accuracy and validity of test results. Any anomalies or equipment
malfunctions must be reported to the supervisor immediately.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred Specimen:
• 5 mL serum collected in a serum separator tube (SST).
• Allow the blood to clot for a minimum of 30 minutes before
centrifugation.
Specimen Stability:
• Refrigerated samples at 2-8°C are stable for up to 7 days.
• Frozen samples at -20°C are stable for up to 6 months.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric specimens.
• Specimens collected in anticoagulant tubes (e.g., EDTA, heparin,
citrate).
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Centrifuge
• ELISA plate reader or automated immunoassay analyzer
Reagents:
• CMV IgM and IgG ELISA kits or reagents required for the specific
immunoassay analyzer being used.
• Calibrators and controls as provided by the manufacturer.
Supplies:
• Micropipettes and tips
• Microwell plates (if using ELISA kits)
• Plate washer (if using ELISA kits)
• PPE (gloves, lab coat, face shield)
1. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation and Handling
1. Centrifuge clotted blood samples at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes to
separate the serum.
2. Aliquot the clear serum into a labeled secondary tube if
required.
3. Store samples at 2-8°C if testing within 7 days or freeze at
-20°C for long-term storage.
B. Assay Procedure Using ELISA
1. Bring all reagents and samples to room temperature before
use.
2. Prepare standards, controls, and samples in duplicate.
3. Add 100 µL of standards, controls, and samples to the
appropriate microwells.
4. Incubate the plate for 60 minutes at room temperature.
5. Wash the plate 4 times with wash buffer.
6. Add 100 µL of enzyme conjugate to each well.
7. Incubate for 30 minutes at room temperature.
8. Wash the plate 4 times with wash buffer.
9. Add 100 µL of substrate solution to each well.
10. Incubate for 15 minutes at room temperature in the dark.
11. Add 50 µL of stop solution to each well.
12. Read the absorbance at 450 nm using a plate reader within 30
minutes.
C. Assay Procedure Using Automated Analyzer
1. Load reagent packs, calibrators, controls, and samples onto the
analyzer.
2. Select the appropriate test protocol for CMV IgM and IgG.
3. Initiate the run using the analyzer's software.
4. Review and verify the data once the run is complete.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
6. Run quality controls and calibrators with each batch of patient
samples.
7. Both positive and negative controls must fall within the
manufacturer's specified ranges.
8. Document results of controls in a QC log. Investigate any
control failures and rerun affected samples if necessary.
9. Perform regular maintenance and calibration of equipment as
per manufacturer's instructions.
10. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
Positive Result (IgM or IgG):
• The absorbance or signal intensity of the sample is greater than
or equal to the cutoff value.
Negative Result (IgM or IgG):
• The absorbance or signal intensity of the sample is less than the
cutoff value.
Equivocal Result:
• Results within a specified range close to the cutoff should be
repeated. If the repeat test is again equivocal, follow the
interpretation guidelines provided by the kit manufacturer.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
2. Ensure results are reviewed and verified by the laboratory
technologist.
3. Report results following site-specific guidelines.
4. Document and communicate any critical values to the
requesting healthcare provider immediately.
5. LIMITATIONS
• Refer to the assay kit insert or analyzer manual for limitations
specific to the methodology.
• False positives or negatives can occur due to cross-reactivity or
interfering substances.
