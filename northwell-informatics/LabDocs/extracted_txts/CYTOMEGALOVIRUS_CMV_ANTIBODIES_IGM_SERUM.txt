Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Cytomegalovirus (CMV) Antibodies, IgM,
Serum
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for the analysis of Cytomegalovirus (CMV)
Antibodies, IgM, in patient serum specimens to ensure accuracy,
consistency, and reliability of results.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all qualified personnel within the laboratory
who are responsible for running, interpreting, and reporting CMV IgM
antibody tests.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
Qualified laboratory personnel are responsible for performing the
procedure as outlined, documenting results, and initiating necessary
corrective actions if issues arise. It is the responsibility of the
supervising technologist to review and verify test results.
4. DEFINITIONS
CMV IgM Antibodies – Early antibodies produced by the immune
system in response to an infection with Cytomegalovirus, indicating
recent exposure or primary infection.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Automated Immunoassay Analyzer
• CMV IgM Antibody Test Kit
• Calibrators and Controls
• Serum Separator Tubes (SST)
• Pipettes and tips
• Laboratory label printer and labels
• Personal Protective Equipment (lab coat, gloves, face shield)
6. PROCEDURE
6.1 Preparation
6.1.1 Ensure that all equipment is calibrated, and maintenance logs
are up to date. 6.1.2 Wear appropriate personal protective
equipment. 6.1.3 Verify that reagents and controls are not expired
and are stored as specified by the manufacturer.
6.2 Specimen Handling
6.2.1 Ensure that serum samples have been properly collected,
labeled, and stored. 6.2.2 Verify that specimens are non-hemolyzed
and free from clots. If clotted or hemolyzed, reject the sample. 6.2.3
Allow serum specimens to come to room temperature before
analysis.
6.3 Calibration and Quality Control
6.3.1 Run calibrators and controls at the beginning of each analytical
run. 6.3.2 Ensure controls fall within the specified range. If controls
fall outside the acceptable range, troubleshoot per the manufacturer’s
instructions and do not proceed with patient testing until resolved.
6.3.3 Document all calibrator and control results in the quality control
log.
6.4 Running the Test
6.4.1 Load the patient specimens, calibrators, and quality control
materials onto the analyzer as per the manufacturer's instructions.
6.4.2 Program the analyzer with the appropriate test parameters for
CMV IgM antibody analysis.
6.5 Interpreting Results
6.5.1 Review and validate the assay results provided by the analyzer.
6.5.2 Interpret results using the criteria provided by the manufacturer:
• Positive: Presence of CMV IgM antibodies detected, indicating
recent or active CMV infection.
• Negative: No CMV IgM antibodies detected, indicating no recent
CMV infection.
• Equivocal: Inconclusive results, recommend retesting or further
clinical correlation.
6.6 Documentation and Reporting
6.6.1 Record the test results in the laboratory information system
(LIS). 6.6.2 Verify and validate the test results. 6.6.3 Report results to
the requesting physician or healthcare provider as per established
laboratory protocol.
7. TROUBLESHOOTING
7.1 If an error code or unexpected result is observed, refer to the
troubleshooting section of the analyzer's user manual. 7.2 Re-run the
test for any specimen that yields an equivocal result. 7.3 Consult the
on-call supervisor or technical support if repeated errors occur.
8. MAINTENANCE
8.1 Perform daily maintenance checks on the analyzer. 8.2 Perform
weekly, monthly, and as-needed maintenance as recommended by
the manufacturer.
9. QUALITY CONTROL
9.1 Quality control should be performed with each batch or run of
testing using appropriate controls. 9.2 Document all quality control
activities in quality control logs. 9.3 Investigate and document
corrective actions if control results fall outside the predetermined
range.
