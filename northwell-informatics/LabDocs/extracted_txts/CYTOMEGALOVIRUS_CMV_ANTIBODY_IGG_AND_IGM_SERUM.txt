Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for
CYTOMEGALOVIRUS (CMV) ANTIBODY,
IGG AND IGM, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedures for the detection
of Cytomegalovirus (CMV) IgG and IgM antibodies in serum using an
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). This test is used for
the diagnosis of recent or past CMV infection.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of qualified laboratory personnel to accurately
perform the CMV IgG and IgM antibody assays, document the
results, and ensure all quality control measures are adhered to during
the process. The laboratory supervisor is responsible for overseeing
the process and troubleshooting when necessary.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type: Serum
Volume: Minimum volume of 1 mL
Collection: Blood collected via venipuncture into a serum separator
tube (SST)
Handling: Allow blood to clot and centrifuge within 2 hours of
collection to separate serum. Transfer serum into a labeled aliquot
tube.
Storage: Serum specimens should be stored at 2-8°C if tested within
72 hours; for longer storage, keep frozen at -20°C or lower.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed serum samples
• Lipemic specimens
• Specimens with insufficient volume
• Specimens stored at incorrect temperatures
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• ELISA reader
• Microplate washer
• Micropipettes and tips
• Incubator
Reagents and Supplies:
• CMV IgG ELISA kit
• CMV IgM ELISA kit
• Quality control sera (negative and positive controls)
• Distilled water
• Disposable gloves
• Laboratory bench protectors
5. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation
1. Review of Requisition: Verify patient information and test
requisition forms.
2. Check Expiry Dates: Confirm that all reagents and kits are not
expired.
3. Bring Reagents to Room Temperature: Remove reagents
from refrigeration and allow them to reach room temperature
(15-25°C) before use.
B. Testing Procedure for CMV IgG and IgM ELISA
1. Plate Layout: Set up the microplate with necessary wells for
standards, controls, and patient samples. Follow the CMV
ELISA kit insert for well positioning.
2. Sample Addition:
◦ Add 100 µL of each patient sample, controls, and calibrators
to appropriate wells.
◦ Seal plate and incubate as per kit instructions (usually 30
minutes at 37°C).
3. Washing:
◦ Wash the plate 3 times with the provided buffer using an
automated plate washer.
4. Conjugate Addition:
◦ Add 100 µL of enzyme conjugate to each well.
◦ Incubate as per kit instructions (usually 30 minutes at room
temperature).
5. Substrate Addition:
◦ Wash the plate as previously mentioned.
◦ Add 100 µL of the substrate solution to each well.
◦ Incubate the plate in the dark for the time specified in the kit
(usually 10-20 minutes at room temperature).
6. Stopping Reaction:
◦ Add 100 µL of stop solution to each well to terminate the
reaction.
7. Reading Plate:
◦ Read the absorbance of each well at the specified
wavelength (usually 450 nm) using the ELISA reader.
8. Interpreting Results:
◦ Using the standard curve, determine the IgG and IgM
antibody concentrations in patient samples.
◦ Results should be compared to reference values provided
(kit-specific).
6. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Internal Quality Control:
◦ Run positive and negative controls with each assay.
◦ Results must fall within the expected range for the assay to
be valid.
2. Troubleshooting:
◦ If controls are out-of-range, repeat the assay or consult the
supervisor.
3. Documentation:
◦ Record all control results, patient results, and any corrective
actions taken.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Result Interpretation:
◦ IgG positive: Suggests past or persistent infection.
◦ IgM positive: Suggests recent or acute infection.
◦ Interpret results based on the guidelines provided with the
ELISA kits.
2. Data Entry:
◦ Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
3. Review and Verification:
◦ Technologist to review and verify results before releasing to
clinician.
8. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• CMV IgG: Negative: <0.9 IU/mL, Equivocal: 0.9-1.1 IU/mL,
Positive: >1.1 IU/mL
• CMV IgM: Negative: <0.9 IU/mL, Equivocal: 0.9-1.1 IU/mL,
Positive: >1.1 IU/mL Note: Reference intervals may vary
depending on the manufacturer’s kit insert.
9. LIMITATIONS
• Cross-reactivity with other viral antibodies can lead to false-
positive results.
• Hemolysis, lipemia, and bacterial contamination can interfere with
results.
• Immunocompromised patients may have suppressed antibody
responses.
