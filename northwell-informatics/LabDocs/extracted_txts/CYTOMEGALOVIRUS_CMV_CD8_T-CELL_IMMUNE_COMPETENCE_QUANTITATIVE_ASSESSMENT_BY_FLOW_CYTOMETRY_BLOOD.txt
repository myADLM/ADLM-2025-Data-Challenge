1. PURPOSE
To establish a standardized and validated procedure for the
quantitative assessment of Cytomegalovirus (CMV) CD8 T-cell
immune competence using flow cytometry in blood specimens.
Responsibility:
The trained technologists and laboratory scientists are responsible
for performing CMV CD8 T-cell assessments. It is their duty to ensure
the proper execution of the protocol, accurate data documentation,
and timely reporting of results.
1. DEFINITION
Flow cytometry is a technique utilized to measure the physical and
chemical characteristics of cells or particles. This protocol involves
the analysis of CMV-specific CD8 T-cells present in blood samples to
evaluate immune competence.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Preferred/acceptable: - Whole blood collected in EDTA tubes
(lavender-top vacutainer) or Heparin tubes (green-top vacutainer). -
Specimens must arrive in the laboratory within 24 hours of collection.
Use of relevant transport systems (e.g., pneumatic tube,
transportation worker) is required. - Specimen should be maintained
at 2–8°C during transport.
Unacceptable: - Specimens not arriving in the laboratory within 24
hours of collection. - Specimens arriving without a collection date/
time indicated. - Specimen with clots or hemolysis.
1. PROCEDURE
2. Preparation a. Accept specimen and verify necessary
documentation (sample ID, collection date/time). b. Store
specimens at 2–8°C until processing.
3. Cell Staining a. Mix specimen gently to ensure adequate
homogenization. b. Aliquot 100-200μL of whole blood into a
properly labeled flow cytometry tube. c. Add antibodies specific
to CD8, CMV Tetramer, and relevant markers (e.g., CD45, CD3)
as per manufacturer's instructions. d. Mix gently but thoroughly,
ensuring all cells are exposed to the antibodies. e. Incubate in
the dark at 2–8°C for the time specified by antibody
manufacturer (generally 15-30 minutes).
4. Red Blood Cell Lysis a. Add the appropriate volume of lysing
solution as per manufacturer's instructions. b. Mix gently and
incubate at room temperature for recommended duration
(generally 10 minutes) to lyse red blood cells. c. Centrifuge at
300 × g for 5 minutes. d. Carefully aspirate supernatant and
wash cells with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). e. Repeat
centrifugation and aspiration steps to ensure purity of
lymphocyte population.
5. Flow Cytometry Acquisition a. Resuspend the pellet in PBS or
flow cytometry buffer. b. Proceed with sample acquisition on the
flow cytometer following the instrument guidelines. c. Utilize
appropriate controls and compensation beads for fluorescence
adjustment. d. Collect a sufficient number of events (generally
50,000-100,000) to ensure robust statistical analysis.
6. Data Analysis a. Utilize flow cytometry analysis software to
distinguish CMV-specific CD8 T-cells. b. Apply gating strategy: -
Gate on lymphocytes using scatter properties (forward vs. side
scatter). - Gate on CD45+ (leukocytes), CD3+CD8+ (T-cells). -
Identify CMV Tetramer+CD8+ cells (CMV-specific CD8 T-cells).
c. Quantify percentages and absolute counts of CMV-specific
CD8 T-cells in the sample. d. Compare results to established
reference ranges and quality control standards.
7. Quality Control a. Include appropriate quality control samples
(known positive/negative controls) with each batch. b. Perform
periodic proficiency testing to validate assay performance. c.
Document all QC results and corrective actions if necessary. d.
Ensure instrument calibration and maintenance are performed
as per manufacturer’s guidelines.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
Results should be reviewed by the responsible technologist and
verified before transmission to the LIS. Reports should include: -
Percentage and absolute count of CMV-specific CD8 T-cells. -
Reference intervals based on validated standards. - Comments on
sample integrity and any deviations from standard procedure.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Reference ranges for CMV-specific CD8 T-cells should be
established based on the healthy population data and reviewed
periodically.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to manufacturer's insert for individual reagent limitations and
potential interferences. Ensure ongoing review and updates of
protocol based on clinical and analytical findings.
