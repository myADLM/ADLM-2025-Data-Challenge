Standard Operating Procedure for Cytomegalovirus
(CMV) Detection (Qualitative)
1. PURPOSE
To outline the analytical phase of the procedure for the qualitative
detection of Cytomegalovirus (CMV) DNA in patient specimens using
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory personnel to
perform and document each step of the procedure in accordance
with this SOP. Supervisors are responsible for ensuring proper
training and adherence to this procedure, as well as addressing any
deficiencies.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Acceptable Specimens
• Whole blood (EDTA)
• Plasma or serum (EDTA, SST)
• Urine
• Saliva or throat swab
• Tissue biopsy
Specimen Handling
• Specimens are to be stored at 2-8°C if processing is delayed, but
no later than 72 hours post-collection.
• Freeze specimens at -70°C if potential delays exceed 72 hours.
• Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
• Requisition forms should accompany all specimens with relevant
patient information and collection details.
4. REAGENTS, CONSUMABLES AND EQUIPMENT
• PCR-grade water and buffers
• Positive and negative CMV control reagents
• CMV-specific primers and probes
• DNA extraction kits
• PCR master mix
• Real-time PCR instrument
• Microcentrifuge tubes and filter tips
• Pipettes and disposable gloves
• Biosafety cabinet (Class II)
5. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation for Detection
1. Reagent Preparation:
◦ Prepare PCR master mix including primers, probes, PCR
buffer, dNTPs, and Taq polymerase as per the
manufacturer's instructions.
◦ Thaw all specimens, controls, and reagents at room
temperature before use.
B. DNA Extraction
1. Specimen Processing:
◦ Process each patient specimen and corresponding control
sample by following the DNA extraction protocol from the kit.
◦ Verify the extracted DNA quality and quantity using a
spectrophotometer.
C. PCR Setup
1. Control Setup:
◦ Include a positive control (known CMV DNA) and a negative
control (sterile buffer or water) in each run.
2. Reaction Mixture:
◦ Aliquot the prepared PCR master mix into appropriately
labeled PCR tubes or plates.
◦ Add the extracted DNA from each specimen, positive
control, and negative control to the corresponding wells.
3. PCR Conditions:
◦ Program the real-time PCR instrument according to the
following thermal cycling conditions:
▪ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 10 minutes
▪ 45 cycles of:
▪ Denaturation: 95°C for 15 seconds
▪ Annealing/extension: 60°C for 1 minute
D. Amplification and Detection
1. Performing PCR:
◦ Load the prepared PCR tubes or plate into the real-time
PCR instrument and start the run.
◦ Monitor the amplification plot and threshold cycles (Ct
values) provided by the PCR instrument software.
6. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
1. Positive Result:
◦ A positive result is indicated by the detection of the target
CMV DNA-specific signal (amplification) with the positive
control yielding an expected Ct value.
2. Negative Result:
◦ A negative result is indicated by the absence of an
amplification signal in the specimen, while the negative
control confirms no contamination.
3. Invalid Result:
◦ An invalid result arises if the negative control shows
amplification or the positive control fails; the run must be
repeated.
4. Documentation:
◦ Record all Ct values and results in the laboratory
information system. Ensure proper review and verification
by the technologist.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include quality control checks in compliance with laboratory
protocols:
◦ Process controls each run.
◦ Record and review results of controls to ensure assay integrity
and accuracy.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Enter validated results into the laboratory information system.
• Results are reviewed by a certified pathologist before final
verification and release.
• Qualitative results should be reported as “CMV DNA detected” or
“CMV DNA not detected”.
9. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions for the PCR kit.
• Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines for
molecular diagnostic methods.
• Internal quality assurance protocols.
10. SAFETY PRECAUTIONS
• Follow all safety guidelines for handling potentially infectious
specimens and reagents.
• Use personal protective equipment (PPE), including gloves and
lab coats, at all times.
• Dispose of waste material and specimens in accordance with
laboratory biohazard protocols.
11. TROUBLESHOOTING
• Refer to troubleshooting guide in the manufacturer's instructions.
• In case of inconsistent or unexpected results, re-extract and
repeat the PCR run.
• Report persistent issues to the supervisor.
This SOP will be reviewed annually or as needed to ensure
compliance with current regulations and laboratory practices. All staff
are required to be familiar with this protocol and adhere to the
outlined procedures to ensure reliable and accurate CMV detection.
