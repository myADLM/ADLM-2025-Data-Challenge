Cytomegalovirus (CMV) DNA Detection and Quantification by Real-
Time PCR, Plasma
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the detection and
quantification of CMV DNA in plasma samples using Real-Time PCR
technology.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory personnel trained in Real-Time PCR
techniques are responsible for performing this procedure. It is the
responsibility of all staff to follow proper protocols to ensure accurate
and reliable results.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/acceptable:
• Plasma collected in EDTA anticoagulant tubes
• Minimum volume required: 1 mL
• Specimens should be stored at 2-8°C and processed within 72
hours of collection
Unacceptable:
• Specimens collected in heparin tubes
• Specimens with visible hemolysis or contamination
• Specimens arriving in the laboratory without a proper collection
date/time indicated on the sample container or requisition
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Real-Time PCR instrument (e.g., Applied Biosystems, Bio-Rad,
Roche)
• Vortex mixer
• Microcentrifuge
• Pipettes and aerosol-resistant tips
Reagents:
• CMV DNA Extraction Kit (e.g., Qiagen, Thermo Fisher)
• Real-Time PCR Master Mix (e.g., TaqMan, SYBR Green)
• CMV-specific primers and probes
• Nuclease-free water
Supplies:
• 0.2 mL PCR tubes or plates
• Sample collection and storage tubes
• Disposable gloves
• Lab coat
1. PROCEDURE
A. DNA Extraction:
1. Begin by thawing the plasma samples at room temperature if
frozen.
2. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for the DNA extraction kit
to prepare the samples.
3. Ensure all samples are properly labeled and documented.
B. Real-Time PCR Setup:
1. Prepare the Real-Time PCR Master Mix according to the
manufacturer’s instructions, including CMV-specific primers and
probes.
2. Aliquot the Master Mix into PCR tubes or plates.
3. Add extracted DNA samples to the tubes or plates, ensuring an
accurate and consistent volume.
4. Include negative controls, positive controls, and standard
controls in each PCR run.
5. Seal the PCR tubes or plates and vortex briefly to mix the
contents.
6. Spin the tubes or plates in a microcentrifuge to ensure all liquid
is at the bottom.
C. Real-Time PCR Cycling:
1. Insert the PCR tubes or plates into the Real-Time PCR
instrument.
2. Program the cycling conditions according to the manufacturer’s
instructions, typically including:
◦ Initial denaturation at 95°C for 10 minutes
◦ Cycling conditions: 40 cycles of 95°C for 15 seconds and
60°C for 1 minute
3. Begin the PCR run and monitor the progress.
D. Data Analysis:
1. After completion of the PCR run, analyze the data using the
Real-Time PCR software provided with the instrument.
2. Determine the quantification of CMV DNA based on the
standard curve generated by the controls.
3. Ensure all results are reviewed and verified by a technologist.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
Each run must include:
• Negative control to detect contamination
• Positive control to confirm amplification
• Standard control for quantification accuracy
Any deviation from expected control results must be documented and
investigated. Repeat the PCR run if necessary.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
Results should be reported in copies/mL. Refer to site-specific
reporting guidelines for format and documentation.
Critical Results:
• CMV viral load exceeding 10^7 copies/mL should be flagged and
reported immediately to the ordering physician.
• Follow repeat critical values guidelines as per site-specific
protocol.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Limitations associated with PCR technique involve potential
contamination, sample integrity issues, and the inability to distinguish
between latent and active infections.
