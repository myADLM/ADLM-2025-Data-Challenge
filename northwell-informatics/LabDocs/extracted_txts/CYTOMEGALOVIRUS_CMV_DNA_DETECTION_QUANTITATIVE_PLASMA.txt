Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for CYTOMEGALOVIRUS
(CMV) DNA DETECTION (QUANTITATIVE), PLASMA
1. PURPOSE
To provide accurate and reproducible detection and quantification of
Cytomegalovirus (CMV) DNA in plasma using molecular techniques.
This protocol ensures reliable results for clinical diagnosis and patient
management.
Responsibility:
Designated staff are responsible for performing the CMV DNA
detection procedure and documenting results. All staff must identify
any deficiencies or issues during the analytical phase and report
them to the supervisor.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Acceptable Specimens:
• Plasma collected in EDTA anticoagulant tubes.
• Minimum volume required: 1 mL of plasma.
• Specimen must be stored and transported at 2-8°C and tested
within 72 hours of collection or stored frozen at -20°C or lower for
longer periods.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens collected in anticoagulants other than EDTA.
• Specimens with insufficient volume.
• Specimens showing signs of hemolysis, contamination, or
improper storage.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Real-time PCR instrument (e.g. ABI 7500 Fast, Roche
LightCycler)
• Biological safety cabinet
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes and filtered tips
• Vortex mixer
• Plate reader
Reagents:
• Commercially available CMV DNA Quantitative assay kit (refer to
manufacturer’s instructions)
• DNA extraction kit (if applicable)
• Positive and negative controls
Supplies:
• EDTA tubes
• Microcentrifuge tubes
• PCR tubes or plates
• Gloves, lab coat, and other PPE
1. PROCEDURE
Sample Preparation:
1. Centrifuge EDTA tubes at 1500 x g for 10 minutes to separate
plasma.
2. Transfer plasma to a sterile microcentrifuge tube without
disturbing the buffy coat.
3. Store plasma at 2-8°C if testing within 72 hours or at -20°C or
lower for longer storage.
DNA Extraction:
1. Follow the DNA extraction kit protocol to extract DNA from
plasma.
2. Ensure DNA integrity and concentration meets the
requirements of the CMV DNA Quantitative assay.
3. Store extracted DNA at -20°C or lower until PCR setup.
PCR Setup:
1. Prepare PCR master mix according to assay kit instructions.
2. Aliquot master mix into PCR tubes or plates.
3. Add extracted DNA samples, positive control, negative control,
and internal control (if required) to the respective tubes.
PCR Cycling:
1. Load tubes/plate into the real-time PCR instrument.
2. Enter the appropriate cycling conditions and parameters
according to the assay kit instructions.
3. Start the PCR run and monitor the amplification process.
Result Interpretation:
1. Analyze the amplification curves and Ct values using the
software provided with the PCR instrument.
2. Compare sample Ct values with the standard curve to
determine CMV DNA load.
3. Review internal control results to ensure assay validity.
Quality Control:
1. Run positive and negative controls with each batch of tests.
2. Ensure all controls fall within the expected range; otherwise,
troubleshoot and repeat the assay.
3. Perform periodic proficiency testing and inter-laboratory
comparisons.
Reporting Results:
1. Document results, including CMV DNA load in IU/mL, in the
Laboratory Information System (LIS).
2. Review and verify results before releasing to the clinician.
3. Report critical values (<1000 IU/mL) promptly following lab
policy for critical results.
4. REFERENCES
Refer to the manufacturer’s insert provided with the CMV DNA
Quantitative assay kit for detailed instructions. Refer to laboratory-
specific guidelines and policies for specimen handling, storage, and
reporting. CAP and CLIA regulations for molecular testing.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Ensure proper specimen collection and handling to avoid false
results. PCR inhibitors in the plasma may impact assay performance;
sample cleanup may be required. Refer to the assay manufacturer’s
limitations and troubleshooting guide.
By following this SOP, the laboratory ensures reliable detection and
quantification of CMV DNA in patient plasma, aiding in clinical
diagnosis and management.
