STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP) FOR
CYTOMEGALOVIRUS (CMV) IgG TESTING - SERUM
1. PURPOSE To provide a clear and standardized method for the
qualitative and quantitative determination of Cytomegalovirus IgG
antibodies in serum samples.
2. SCOPE This procedure applies to all qualified laboratory personnel
conducting the CMV IgG test in the immunology or serology sections
of the laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY Qualified laboratory personnel and supervisors
are responsible for ensuring that the procedure is followed, and all
results are documented accurately. It is the responsibility of all staff to
identify any issues and to notify supervisors.
4. DEFINITIONS CMV IgG: Immunoglobulin G antibodies specific for
Cytomegalovirus, indicative of past infection or immunity.
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen type: Serum
• Collection container: Red-top or serum separator tube (SST)
• Specimen volume: Minimum 1 mL serum
• Handling and Transport:
◦ Allow the blood to clot at room temperature (15–30 minutes).
◦ Centrifuge to separate the serum.
◦ Transfer the serum to a labeled transport tube if using a red-
top tube.
◦ Store and transport at 2–8°C if testing within 48 hours; for
longer storage, freeze at -20°C or colder.
Unacceptable Specimens
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
• Samples collected or stored in inappropriate tubes.
• Samples with insufficient volume.
6. EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS
• ELISA (Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay) or
chemiluminescence analyzer appropriate for CMV IgG testing.
• Pipettes and sterile tips.
• Micropipettes.
• Incubator (37°C).
• Washer for ELISA plates.
• Reagents and controls (CMV IgG reagent kits, positive and
negative controls, calibrators).
• Disposable gloves.
• Laboratory timer.
• Safety equipment (biosafety cabinet, lab coat, etc.).
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run assay controls (negative control, positive control, and
calibrator) with each batch of samples.
• Include internal quality control (IQC) samples with known CMV
IgG concentrations in each run.
• Ensure controls are within the expected range before proceeding
with the test results.
8. PROCEDURE
1. Pre-analytical Preparation
◦ Confirm that the serum samples are free of hemolysis,
lipemia, or icterus.
◦ Aliquot the required volume of serum into appropriate wells
or tubes.
2. Reagent Preparation
◦ Prepare the reagents, standards, and controls as specified
in the reagent kit insert.
3. Sample and Control Loading
◦ Pipette the required volume of calibrators, controls, and
patient serum samples into the respective wells of the
microtiter plate.
4. Incubation
◦ Follow the manufacturer's instructions for incubation times
and conditions.
◦ Typically, samples are incubated with the enzyme conjugate
reagent at 37°C for a specified time.
5. Washing
◦ After incubation, wash the wells using an automated washer
or manually with a wash solution provided in the kit.
6. Substrate Addition
◦ Add the substrate solution to each well.
◦ Incubate for a designated period at room temperature or as
specified by the manufacturer.
7. Stopping the Reaction
◦ Add the stop solution to each well to terminate the
enzymatic reaction.
8. Reading the Plate
◦ Measure the absorbance at the specified wavelength
(commonly 450 nm) using a microplate reader.
9. CALCULATION OF RESULTS
• Qualitative Interpretation:
◦ Compare the absorbance of samples to the cutoff value
determined by the average absorbance of the negative control
plus a set factor (refer to the kit insert for the factor value).
◦ Positive: Absorbance above the cutoff value.
◦ Negative: Absorbance below the cutoff value.
• Quantitative Interpretation:
◦ Using the calibration curve, calculate the concentration of
CMV IgG antibodies in IU/mL for each sample. The kit insert
typically provides detailed instructions on how to generate and
interpret the calibration curve.
10. REPORTING RESULTS
• Negative Result: Indicates no detectable CMV IgG antibodies
and suggests no past infection or immunization.
• Positive Result: Indicates the presence of CMV IgG antibodies,
suggesting past or latent infection or successful immune response
post-vaccination.
Critical Values:
• No critical values are designated for CMV IgG; refer to clinical
context and patient history for interpretation.
11. MAINTENANCE AND TROUBLESHOOTING
• Perform routine maintenance of equipment per manufacturer
recommendations.
• Document any troubleshooting or deviations in a logbook.
• If controls are out of acceptable ranges, do not report patient
results and repeat the test with new reagents.
12. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• False positives or false negatives can occur due to cross-
reactivity or technical errors.
• Interpretation should consider the clinical context and patient
history.

14. REVIEW AND DOCUMENTATION
• Review SOP annually or as needed based on method revisions,
guideline updates, or laboratory needs.
• Document all changes and review dates in the revision history.
By following this protocol, laboratory personnel can ensure the
generation of reliable and accurate results for CMV IgG testing in
serum samples.
