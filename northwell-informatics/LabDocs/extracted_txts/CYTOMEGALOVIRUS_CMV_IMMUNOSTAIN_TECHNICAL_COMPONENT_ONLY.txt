CYTOMEGALOVIRUS (CMV) IMMUNOSTAIN, TECHNICAL
COMPONENT ONLY - STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE
(SOP)
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the standard protocol for performing a CMV
immunostaining procedure to detect CMV antigens in prepared tissue
specimens. This guide includes the steps for preparing slides,
performing immunohistochemistry, and documentation of the results
for the technical component only.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing
CMV immunostaining as outlined in this procedure.
• It is the responsibility of all staff to ensure all steps are followed
correctly, quality control measures are implemented, and any
deviations from the protocol are reported to the supervisor.
2. DEFINITIONS
• CMV: Cytomegalovirus, a common virus that can infect humans
belonging to the herpesvirus family.
• Immunostaining: Technique to detect specific antigens in cells by
utilizing antibodies specific to that antigen.
3. PROCEDURE
Reagents and Supplies:
• CMV primary antibody
• Secondary antibody with chromogen (e.g., alkaline phosphatase
or horseradish peroxidase-conjugated)
• Blocking solution
• PBS (phosphate-buffered saline)
• Enzymatic retrieval solution (e.g., proteinase K)
• Counterstain (e.g., hematoxylin)
• Mounting medium
• Slides with prepared (paraffin-embedded or frozen) tissue
sections
• Positive and negative control slides
Equipment:
• Microscopy equipment
• Humidified chamber
• Staining racks
• Automated immunostaining system (if available)
• Incubator (37°C)
• Timer
Procedure Steps:
A) Slide Preparation:
1. Pre-treatment of Slides:
◦ Deparaffinize and rehydrate tissue sections if using formalin-
fixed paraffin-embedded tissues:
▪ Xylene: 2 changes, 5 minutes each
▪ 100% Ethanol: 2 changes, 5 minutes each
▪ 95% Ethanol: 2 changes, 3 minutes each
▪ 70% Ethanol: 2 changes, 2 minutes each
▪ Distilled water rinse
2. Antigen Retrieval:
◦ Perform enzymatic retrieval on the tissue sections using
proteinase K for 10 minutes at room temperature.
◦ Wash slides in PBS for 5 minutes.
B) Immunostaining:
1. Blocking Non-specific Binding:
◦ Apply blocking solution to the tissue sections and incubate
for 10 minutes at room temperature.
◦ Drain slides without washing.
2. Primary Antibody:
◦ Apply the CMV primary antibody to each tissue section.
◦ Incubate in a humidified chamber at 37°C for 60 minutes.
◦ Rinse slides 2 times with PBS for 5 minutes each.
3. Secondary Antibody:
◦ Apply the appropriate secondary antibody conjugated with
an enzyme (e.g., HRP or alkaline phosphatase).
◦ Incubate in a humidified chamber at room temperature for
30 minutes.
◦ Rinse slides 2 times with PBS for 5 minutes each.
4. Chromogen Development:
◦ Apply the chromogen solution to the tissue sections and
incubate as recommended by the manufacturer.
◦ Stop the reaction by rinsing with distilled water once the
desired color intensity is reached.
5. Counterstaining:
◦ Counterstain slides with hematoxylin for 1 minute.
◦ Rinse in tap water followed by distilled water.
6. Mounting:
◦ Dehydrate tissues through graded alcohols and clear in
xylene.
◦ Apply a coverslip with mounting medium.
C) Quality Control:
1. Include positive and negative controls with each batch of tests
to validate staining protocol.
2. Document control results and compare with expected outcomes
to ensure assay performance.
3. Note any inconsistent or non-specific staining observed.
4. RESULT DOCUMENTATION:
• All slides are to be reviewed and documented by a trained
pathologist or designated histotechnologist.
• Document observations including staining intensity, background
staining, and any anomalies.
• Record results in the lab information system (LIS) indicating the
presence or absence of CMV antigens.
Reference Ranges:
• Positive Control: Staining should be observed in expected areas
indicating a positive result for CMV antigen.
• Negative Control: No staining should be observed indicating
absence of non-specific binding.
5. REPORTING RESULTS:
• Report findings to requesting pathologist or physician
emphasizing the technical component results.
• Ensure all observations and interpretations are documented
accurately and reviewed by a qualified individual.
• Include comments if re-staining or further testing is required
based on initial results.
6. REFERENCES:
• Instruction manuals for CMV primary and secondary antibodies.
• Standard immunohistochemistry texts and guidelines.
• Manufacturer’s instructions for retrieval solutions and
chromogens.
This SOP outlines the essential steps and required quality measures
to ensure consistent and accurate performance of CMV
immunostaining, technical component only. Regular review and
adherence to this protocol are mandatory for maintaining laboratory
standards.
