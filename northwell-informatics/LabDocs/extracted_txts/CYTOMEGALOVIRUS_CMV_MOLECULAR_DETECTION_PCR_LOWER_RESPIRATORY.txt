Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for CYTOMEGALOVIRUS
(CMV) MOLECULAR DETECTION, PCR, LOWER RESPIRATORY
SPECIMEN
1. PURPOSE
This protocol details the steps for the detection of Cytomegalovirus
(CMV) using Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) technology from
lower respiratory specimens including bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL)
and sputum samples. The implementation of this method ensures
accurate and reliable detection of CMV in clinical specimens from
patients presenting with lower respiratory tract infections.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all trained laboratory personnel performing
molecular detection of CMV in lower respiratory specimens using
PCR techniques.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing
all steps outlined in this SOP accurately.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring the appropriate training
of personnel, adherence to this SOP, and addressing any
procedural issues.
4. DEFINITIONS
• PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction): A technique used to amplify
small segments of DNA to detectable levels.
• Lower respiratory specimens: Clinical specimens from the
lower respiratory tract, including bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL)
fluid and sputum.
5. EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS
• Real-time PCR instrument (e.g., Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast
Real-Time PCR System)
• Nucleic acid extraction system (e.g., QIAGEN QIAcube or manual
extraction kits)
• PCR-grade water and reagents
• CMV-specific primers and probes
• Positive and negative control samples
• Consumables: Pipettes, pipette tips with filters, microcentrifuge
tubes, PCR plates, and sealing films
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE): Lab coat, gloves, eye
protection
6. PROCEDURE
6.1 Specimen Preparation
6.1.1 Acceptance Criteria:
• Ensure specimens are suitable for testing (e.g., BAL or sputum).
• Confirm specimens have been appropriately collected and
transported to the laboratory within the required timeframe and
stored at 2-8°C if not processed immediately.
6.1.2 Rejection Criteria:
• Specimens transported beyond the acceptable time frame.
• Inadequately labeled or leaking samples.
6.2 Nucleic Acid Extraction
6.2.1 Manual Extraction:
• Use a commercially available kit (e.g., QIAGEN QIAamp DNA
Mini Kit).
• Follow manufacturer’s instructions for nucleic acid extraction,
including all incubation and wash steps.
6.2.2 Automated Extraction:
• Load specimens into the automated extraction system (e.g.,
QIAcube).
• Follow system prompts and manufacturer’s guidelines for nucleic
acid extraction.
6.3 PCR Setup
6.3.1 Reagent Preparation:
• Thaw all reagents on ice before use.
• Prepare a master mix containing PCR-grade water, buffers,
magnesium chloride, dNTPs, primers, probes, and DNA
polymerase in a sterile microcentrifuge tube under a laminar flow
hood.
6.3.2 Reaction Assembly:
• Aliquot the master mix into each well of a PCR plate.
• Add 5 µL of extracted nucleic acid from each sample to the
corresponding wells.
• Include positive and negative control samples in the same run to
ensure the validity of the PCR results.
6.4 PCR Amplification
6.4.1 Programming the PCR Instrument:
• Set up the thermal cycling parameters on the PCR machine
based on the optimized protocol for CMV detection:
◦ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 10 minutes
◦ Denaturation: 95°C for 15 seconds
◦ Annealing/Extension: 60°C for 1 minute
◦ Number of cycles: 40
6.4.2 Running the PCR:
• Place the PCR plate in the instrument and start the run.
• Ensure no disturbances occur during the run to avoid data loss or
contamination.
6.5 Data Analysis and Interpretation
6.5.1 Analyzing Results:
• Utilize the real-time PCR software to analyze the amplification
curves.
• Verify that positive controls have amplified showing the expected
threshold cycle (Ct) values.
• Negative controls should have no detectable amplification.
• Consider a Ct value ≤ 40 as indicative of the presence of CMV
DNA.
6.5.2 Validation and Reporting:
• Validate the entire run based on control results and amplification
efficiency.
• Document positive and negative results clearly in the laboratory
information system (LIS).
• Review and verify results according to laboratory protocols.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
7.1 Internal Controls:
• Include internal controls with each run to monitor extraction and
amplification efficiency.
• Ensure control performance is within acceptance criteria before
reporting patient results.
7.2 External Controls:
• Participate in proficiency testing and inter-laboratory comparison
programs to ensure the accuracy and reliability of results.
8. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If positive control fails to amplify, check the reagent integrity, re-
extract nucleic acid, and repeat the PCR.
• Inconsistent results or unexpected amplification patterns should
be investigated by reviewing each step for potential errors or
contamination.
9. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's kit inserts for nucleic acid extraction and PCR
reagents.
• Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines for
molecular diagnostic methods.
10. DOCUMENTATION
• Ensure all observations, deviations, and corrective actions are
documented clearly and retained according to laboratory policy.
11. REVISION HISTORY
• Document any updates or modifications of this SOP with dates
and details of changes.
