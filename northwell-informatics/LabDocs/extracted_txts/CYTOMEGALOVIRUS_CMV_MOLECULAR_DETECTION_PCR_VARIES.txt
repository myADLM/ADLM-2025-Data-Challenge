Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) for Cytomegalovirus
(CMV) Molecular Detection by PCR
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to provide detailed, step-by-step
instructions for the detection of Cytomegalovirus (CMV) DNA in
clinical specimens using Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). The
protocol ensures accurate, reliable, and reproducible results essential
for the diagnosis and monitoring of CMV infections.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all qualified laboratory personnel to perform
CMV molecular detection according to this SOP and to ensure timely
and accurate reporting of results. The laboratory supervisor is
responsible for ensuring the maintenance of equipment, training of
personnel, and compliance with quality control measures.
3. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all clinical specimens received by the laboratory
for CMV DNA detection using the PCR technique. This includes
whole blood, plasma, urine, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and other body
fluids.
4. DEFINITIONS
PCR: Polymerase Chain Reaction, a technique used to amplify
specific DNA sequences. CMV: Cytomegalovirus, a herpesvirus that
can cause disease in immunocompromised individuals.
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred Specimens:
• Whole blood collected in EDTA tubes
• Plasma
• Urine
• Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
• Other body fluids as specified by the ordering clinician
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed specimens
• Specimens not stored or transported under proper conditions
• Specimens without proper labeling or incomplete requisition forms
6. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
Equipment:
• Biosafety Cabinet
• Centrifuge
• Micropipettes and sterile filter tips
• Vortex Mixer
• Thermal Cycler
• Real-Time PCR Instrument
Reagents:
• DNA extraction kits (validated for CMV DNA extraction)
• CMV-specific PCR master mix
• Primers and probes specific to CMV DNA sequences
• Positive and negative control materials
• Nuclease-free water
7. PROCEDURE
7.1 Specimen Processing: a. Verify specimen labeling and
requisition form completeness. b. Centrifuge blood specimens at
1,500 x g for 10 minutes at 4°C to separate plasma. c. Aliquot the
plasma into sterile tubes and proceed to DNA extraction immediately
or store at -80°C for later processing.
7.2 DNA Extraction: a. Extract DNA from clinical specimens using
the DNA extraction kit following the manufacturer's instructions. b.
Include a no-template control (NTC) and an extraction control in each
batch of extractions. c. Quantify and assess the purity of the
extracted DNA using a spectrophotometer.
7.3 PCR Setup: a. Prepare the PCR master mix according to the
manufacturer's instructions. b. Aliquot the master mix into PCR tubes
or a PCR plate. c. Add extracted DNA samples, positive, negative,
and internal controls to the respective wells. d. Seal the PCR tubes or
plate and place them into the thermal cycler.
7.4 PCR Amplification: a. Program the thermal cycler with the
appropriate cycling conditions for CMV detection. - Initial
denaturation: 95°C for 10 minutes - Denaturation: 95°C for 15
seconds - Annealing/Extension: 60°C for 60 seconds - Number of
cycles: 40 b. Start the PCR run.
7.5 Data Analysis: a. Analyze the PCR data using the real-time PCR
instrument software. b. Determine the presence or absence of CMV
DNA based on the amplification curves and cycle threshold (Ct)
values. c. Validate the results by ensuring positive controls, negative
controls, and internal controls meet acceptance criteria.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run positive and negative controls with each batch of specimens
to ensure assay validity.
• Include internal controls in each specimen to monitor for inhibitors
and ensure the efficacy of the extraction and amplification
processes.
• Document all QC results on the appropriate log sheets and review
them before releasing patient results.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
• Report results as "CMV DNA detected" or "CMV DNA not
detected."
• Include cycle threshold (Ct) values and any relevant clinical
interpretation notes in the report, if applicable.
• Follow the laboratory’s standard guidelines for entering results
into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
10. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• False negatives may occur if specimen quality is compromised, if
PCR inhibitors are present, or if the viral load is below the
detection limit.
• False positives can occur due to contamination; hence, stringent
contamination control measures must be enforced.

reagents

molecular diagnostic methods
12. DOCUMENTATION
All documentation related to specimen handling, PCR setup,
amplification, data analysis, quality control results, and reporting
must be maintained according to the laboratory's record-keeping
policies.
13. REVIEW AND REVISION
This SOP will be reviewed annually or whenever a procedural change
is implemented. Revisions will be documented, and laboratory
personnel will be informed and trained on the updated procedures.
