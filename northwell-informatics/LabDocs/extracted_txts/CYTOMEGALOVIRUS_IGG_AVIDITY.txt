Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Cytomegalovirus (CMV)
IgG Avidity Testing
1. PURPOSE To outline the procedure for the measurement of
Cytomegalovirus (CMV) IgG avidity in human serum or plasma
samples at our CLIA-certified laboratory. This test helps distinguish
between primary and past CMV infections.
2. RESPONSIBILITY The responsibility for performing the CMV IgG
avidity test lies with the designated laboratory technologists who are
trained in immunoassay techniques. The supervisor is responsible for
reviewing and verifying the results, and ensuring the adherence to
the SOP.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Human serum or plasma
• Preferred/Acceptable:
◦ Serum collected in a serum separator tube (SST) or plain red-
top tube
◦ Plasma collected in an EDTA, heparin, or citrate tube
• Collection: Follow standard blood collection procedures
• Volume: Minimum 0.5 mL of serum or plasma
• Stability: Store specimens at 2-8°C if testing within 3 days. For
longer storage, freeze at -20°C or lower.
• Unacceptable Conditions:
◦ Hemolyzed, icteric, or lipemic samples
◦ Specimens with visible contamination
◦ Inappropriate collection or storage conditions
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• Equipment:
◦ Microtiter plate reader capable of measuring absorbance at
appropriate wavelengths specified by the kit manufacturer
(usually between 450 - 620 nm)
◦ Plate washer or manual washing setup
◦ Incubators set at 37°C
◦ Pipettes and pipette tips
◦ Vortex mixer
◦ Timer
◦ Centrifuge
• Reagents:
◦ CMV IgG Avidity ELISA kit, including:
▪ Microtiter plates coated with CMV antigen
▪ Avidity buffer
▪ Wash buffer
▪ Conjugate reagent
▪ Substrate reagent
▪ Stop solution
◦ Calibrators and Controls (Low, Medium, High)
◦ Deionized/distilled water
• Supplies:
◦ Absorbent paper
◦ Microtiter plate covers
◦ Polypropylene tubes for dilution
◦ Appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE)
5. PROCEDURE Pre-analytical Phase:
1. Ensure specimens meet the specified requirements.
2. Centrifuge blood samples to separate serum/plasma within 2
hours of collection, if not already done.
3. Label all necessary materials and arrange workspace to
minimize cross-contamination.
Analytical Phase:
1. Reagent Preparation:
• Prepare all reagents and wash buffers according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
• Allow all reagents and samples to reach room temperature
(20-25°C) before use.
1. Sample Dilution:
• Dilute serum/plasma samples as required by the kit
manufacturer’s instructions.
• Mix gently but thoroughly.
1. Assay Protocol:
• Add diluted samples, calibrators, and controls to designated wells
in duplicate.
• Incubate the plate at 37°C for the specified time (usually 30-60
minutes).
• Wash the plate thoroughly with wash buffer (usually three times).
• Add the avidity reagent to each well and incubate for the
stipulated time at room temperature (typically 5-10 minutes).
• Wash the plate thoroughly with wash buffer (usually three times).
• Add conjugate reagent to each well and incubate at 37°C for the
specified time.
• Wash the plates thoroughly with wash buffer (usually three times).
• Add the substrate reagent and incubate at room temperature in
the dark for the prescribed time until color development.
• Add stop solution to each well to halt the color development.
• Read the plate absorbance at the specified wavelength using the
plate reader.
Post-analytical Phase:
1. Data Analysis:
• Calculate the avidity index, as per the kit instructions:
◦ Low avidity (<50%) indicates a recent primary infection.
◦ High avidity (>60%) indicates a non-recent or past infection.
◦ Intermediate avidity (50-60%) needs further analysis or follow-
up testing.
• Record and validate the results using laboratory information
management system (LIS).
1. Quality Control:
• Ensure all control results fall within specified limits. If not, repeat
testing and evaluate potential sources of error.
• Document control results as part of the quality assurance
process.
1. Reporting Results:
• Review results and QC data with the supervisor’s approval.
• Report CMV IgG avidity results along with interpretive comments
based on avidity index values.
6. LIMITATIONS Refer to the manufacturer’s instructions for specific
assay limitations. Factors influencing the accurate measurement of
CMV IgG avidity include:
• Incorrect sample handling
• Incomplete washing steps
• Cross-reactivity with other infections
• Non-standardized pre-analytical sample conditions
