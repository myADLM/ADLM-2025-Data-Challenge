Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Title: Analytical Phase Protocol
for Cytoplasmic Neutrophil Antibodies and Inflammatory Bowel
Disease Panel, Serum
1. PURPOSE:
Establish a consistent, safe, and accurate protocol for the analytical
phase of testing and reporting results for Cytoplasmic Neutrophil
Antibodies (CNA) and Inflammatory Bowel Disease Panel (IBD
Panel) in serum.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of all trained laboratory staff to follow this SOP
to ensure accurate and reliable test results. Supervisors must ensure
that all relevant personnel are adequately trained and competent in
this procedure.
1. SPECIMEN:
Specimen Type:
• Serum
Specimen Collection and Handling:
• Preferred: 3-5 mL of serum from blood drawn in a serum
separator tube (SST) or plain red-top tube.
• After collection, allow blood to clot at room temperature for 30
minutes, then centrifuge at 1500-2000 x g for 10-15 minutes to
separate the serum.
• Transfer the clear serum to a clean, properly labeled plastic vial.
• Store and transport the serum sample at 2-8°C if it will be
analyzed within 48 hours. For longer storage, freeze at -20°C or
colder.
1. REAGENTS, SUPPLIES, AND EQUIPMENT:
Reagents:
• Specific assay kits for Cytoplasmic Neutrophil Antibodies (CNA)
and Inflammatory Bowel Disease Panel (IBD Panel)
• Controls and calibrators as provided by the assay kit
manufacturers
Supplies:
• Micropipettes and disposable tips
• Vortex mixer
• Centrifuge
• Incubator
• Microplates
• Deionized or distilled water
• Absorbent paper or pads
Equipment:
• ELISA reader capable of measuring absorbance at appropriate
wavelengths
• Microplate washer
1. PROCEDURE:
Note: Always follow manufacturer’s instructions provided with each
assay kit.
A. Preparation:
1. Bring all reagents, control, and patient samples to room
temperature before use.
2. Label microplates according to the number of tests to be
performed.
B. CNA Assay:
1. Pipette specified volumes of controls, calibrators, and patient
serum samples into the designated wells of the microplate.
2. Add appropriate detection antibody following the assay kit
instructions.
3. Incubate microplate for the time and temperature specified in
the kit instructions.
4. Wash microplate with the prescribed washing solution.
5. Add substrate solution to each well and incubate as per the kit's
instructions.
6. Add stop solution to each well to halt the substrate reaction.
7. Measure the absorbance at the wavelength specified in the
assay instructions using the ELISA reader.
C. IBD Panel Assay:
1. Follow steps B1 through B7 as above but use the specific
reagents, detection antibodies, and procedures provided in the
IBD Panel assay kit.
2. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS:
• Calculate the results using the provided software or manually as
per assay kit instructions.
• Compare patient results with the established reference ranges.
• Verify and validate results by reviewing the control and calibrator
values. If controls are not within the expected range, repeat the
test.
• Document any discrepancies or issues noted during the analytical
phase in the logbook.
1. QUALITY CONTROL:
• Run quality control samples (positive and negative) with each
batch of tests to ensure assay integrity.
• Perform equipment calibration and maintenance as specified by
the manufacturer.
• Cross-check results with previous patient results and other
laboratory findings for consistency when applicable.
1. REPORTING RESULTS:
• Results are automatically or manually entered into the Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
• Ensure all results are reviewed and verified by a qualified
technologist before reporting to ensure accuracy.
• Critical results must be promptly communicated to the attending
physician following the laboratory’s critical value reporting policy.
1. LIMITATIONS:
• Hemolyzed, icteric, or lipemic samples may affect test results.
• Improper sample handling or deviations from the standard
procedure can lead to erroneous results.
• Refer to the specific assay kit inserts for detailed information on
potential interferences and limits of the methods.
1. REFERENCES:
• Manufacturer's instructions and package inserts for CNA and IBD
Panel Assay Kits.
• Relevant laboratory quality management and control guidelines.
• Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines for
immunoassay procedures.
1. REVISION AND APPROVAL:
• This SOP will be reviewed annually or as needed based on new
methodologies or recommendations.
• Approved by: [Name, Title]
• Effective Date: [DD/MM/YYYY]
• Review Date: [DD/MM/YYYY]
By following this SOP, laboratory personnel will ensure the generation
of accurate and reliable results for Cytoplasmic Neutrophil Antibodies
and Inflammatory Bowel Disease Panel, Serum.
