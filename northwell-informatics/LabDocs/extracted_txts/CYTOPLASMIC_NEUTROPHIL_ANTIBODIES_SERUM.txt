Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Cytoplasmic Neutrophil Antibodies (c-ANCA),
Serum
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to establish the procedures for the
analytical phase of generating results for Cytoplasmic Neutrophil
Antibodies (c-ANCA) in serum. This protocol ensures accurate and
reliable detection of c-ANCA in patient serum specimens, maintaining
quality and integrity throughout the process.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory technologists are responsible for performing
the analysis, ensuring quality control, documenting results, and
reporting findings. It is the responsibility of the laboratory supervisor
to oversee the procedures followed and resolve any analytical issues
that arise.
1. DEFINITION
Cytoplasmic Neutrophil Antibodies (c-ANCA) are autoantibodies
directed against proteins in the cytoplasm of neutrophil granulocytes.
Detection of c-ANCA is essential for diagnosing certain autoimmune
disorders, particularly Wegener's Granulomatosis.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND PREPARATION
Specimen Type: Serum Preferred/Acceptable: 5 mL of blood
collected in a serum separator tube (SST), clotted and centrifuged to
separate serum. Unacceptable: Hemolysed, lipemic, or icteric
specimens; specimens with insufficient volume; improperly labeled
specimens.
Specimens must be stored at 2-8°C if analyzed within 72 hours. For
longer storage, freeze at -20°C or below.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• ELISA reader capable of measuring absorbance at 450 nm.
• Incubator set at 37°C.
• Micropipettes with disposable tips.
• Centrifuge.
• Vortex mixer.
Reagents:
• c-ANCA ELISA Kit (Commercial kit for detection of c-ANCA in
serum).
• Wash buffer, substrate solution, stop solution (provided in the kit).
• Quality control materials (High, Medium, Low controls).
Supplies:
• Serum separator tubes (SST).
• Disposable pipette tips.
• 96-well microtiter plates (provided in the kit).
• Deionized or distilled water.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation:
1. Allow serum samples and reagents to reach room temperature
(18-25°C) prior to testing.
2. Thaw frozen samples at room temperature and mix gently by
inversion. Do not repeatedly freeze/thaw.
B. Assay Procedure:
1. Prepare reagents according to the manufacturer's instructions
provided in the c-ANCA ELISA Kit insert.
2. Determine the number of required wells and prepare the 96-
well microtiter plate accordingly.
3. Add 100 µL of each calibrator, control, and patient serum
sample into the assigned wells.
4. Incubate the plate at 37°C for 1 hour.
5. Wash the wells thoroughly with wash buffer (300 µL per well,
performed at least 3 times).
6. Add 100 µL of enzyme conjugate to each well and incubate at
room temperature for 30 minutes.
7. Wash the wells again as described in step 5.
8. Add 100 µL of substrate solution to each well and incubate in
the dark at room temperature for 15 minutes.
9. Add 50 µL of stop solution to each well to terminate the
reaction.
10. Measure the absorbance of each well at 450 nm using the
ELISA reader.
C. Quality Control:
1. Include quality control materials (High, Medium, Low controls)
with each assay run.
2. Document the control values and ensure they fall within the
acceptable range provided by the manufacturer.
3. If any control is out of range, troubleshoot the assay and repeat
the test if necessary.
D. Data Analysis and Interpretation:
1. Plot the calibration curve of absorbance versus concentration
for the calibration standards.
2. Calculate the patient's sample c-ANCA concentrations using the
calibration curve.
3. Compare the patient sample results against reference intervals
provided in the assay kit or site-specific guidelines.
4. REPORTING RESULTS
5. Enter patient results into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
6. Ensure results are reviewed and verified by a qualified
laboratory technologist.
7. Communicate results to the requesting physician promptly.
8. Flag and promptly report any critical values to the physician
according to the laboratory's critical value policy.
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the c-ANCA ELISA Kit insert for detailed limitations and
interferences that may affect results. Pay particular attention to cross-
reactivity and potential interfering substances.

This SOP must be reviewed and validated annually or whenever
significant changes are made to the procedure. All personnel
involved in the analysis must be adequately trained and proficient in
these procedures.
