STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE - D-DIMER TESTING
1. PURPOSE:
To outline the steps and responsibilities necessary for the proper
analytical testing of D-DIMER levels in plasma specimens to ensure
accurate and reliable results.
RESPONSIBILITY:
Designated laboratory staff members are responsible for performing
the D-DIMER assay and documenting the results. It is the
responsibility of all staff to adhere to the protocol and bring any
issues or concerns to the supervisor's attention.
2. SPECIMEN:
• Preferred: Sodium Citrate plasma
◦ Volume: Minimum 1.0 mL
• Acceptable: EDTA plasma
◦ Volume: Minimum 1.0 mL
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed specimens
• Specimens that have not been processed (centrifuged and
plasma separated) within 2 hours of collection
• Specimens stored at room temperature for more than 4 hours
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES:
• D-DIMER immunoassay kit
• Calibration and control materials
• Automated coagulation analyzer
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Gloves and other personal protective equipment (PPE)
• Sample tubes
4. PROCEDURE:
A. Sample Preparation:
1. Verify that the specimen meets the acceptance criteria listed
above.
2. Centrifuge the sodium citrate or EDTA plasma sample at 1500 x
g for 15 minutes at room temperature.
3. Remove the plasma supernatant and transfer it to a clean,
labeled tube.
4. Proceed with the testing or store the plasma at -20°C if testing
cannot be performed immediately.
B. Assay Procedure:
1. Calibrate the automated coagulation analyzer using the
calibration material provided with the D-DIMER kit.
2. Perform daily quality control using the control materials at both
normal and pathological levels. Document the results of the
quality control tests.
3. Load the specimens, calibrators, and controls into the sample
rack of the analyzer.
4. Program the analyzer with the appropriate assay protocol for
the D-DIMER test.
5. Start the analyzer and monitor the assay run.
6. Upon completion, review the results generated by the analyzer.
C. Review and Documentation:
1. Verify that all quality control results fall within the acceptable
range. If the control results are out of range, troubleshoot the
issue, recalibrate the analyzer, and rerun the controls before
proceeding with patient samples.
2. Review the patient sample results for any flags or error
messages generated by the analyzer.
3. Record the patient results in the laboratory information system
(LIS).
4. If any results are critical or outside the reference range, follow
the laboratory's procedure for reporting critical values.
D. Reference Intervals:
• D-DIMER levels: <500 ng/mL FEU (Fibrinogen Equivalent Units)
5. QUALITY CONTROL:
• Perform quality control at the beginning of each shift, with each
new lot of reagents, and after any maintenance or service on the
analyzer.
• Utilize the quality control materials provided with the assay kit.
• Maintain a log of all quality control results and any corrective
actions taken.
6. REPORTING RESULTS:
• All results should be transmitted automatically to the LIS.
• Critical results should be reviewed and acted upon according to
the laboratory's critical value policy.
• Reference intervals should be included in the report.
7. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
• Refer to the assay kit insert for specific limitations and
interferences that may affect the accuracy of the D-DIMER test.
• Highly lipemic or icteric samples may interfere with the assay and
should be noted.
8. REFERENCES:
• D-DIMER assay kit insert
• Manufacturer's user manual for the automated coagulation
analyzer
• Laboratory quality control and critical values guidelines
By adhering to this protocol, laboratory personnel will ensure the
accurate and timely reporting of D-DIMER levels in plasma,
contributing to effective patient diagnosis and management.
