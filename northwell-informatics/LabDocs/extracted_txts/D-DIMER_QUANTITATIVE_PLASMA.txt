Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for D-DIMER,
QUANTITATIVE PLASMA ANALYSIS
1. PURPOSE
This protocol outlines the step-by-step procedures for accurately and
precisely determining D-Dimer levels in plasma using quantitative
analysis. The goal is to ensure the reliable generation of laboratory
results which are critical for assessing patients' risk of
thromboembolic events.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of all designated laboratory personnel to follow
the procedures as described below, ensuring all quality control
measures are adhered to.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND HANDLING
Preferred/Acceptable:
• 3.2% Sodium Citrate plasma
• Recommended volume: Minimum of 1.0 mL plasma
Unacceptable:
• Specimens that are clotted, hemolyzed, or lipemic
• Tubes not filled to the intended volume
• Specimens older than 8 hours if kept at 2-8°C
• Specimens that have not been properly labeled
Specimen Collection:
• Collect blood using standard venipuncture technique into a blue-
top (sodium citrate) tube.
• Gently invert the tube 3-5 times to mix the anticoagulant.
• Centrifuge the specimen at 1500-2000 x g for 15 minutes.
• Carefully transfer the plasma to a labeled plastic transport tube
without disturbing the cellular layer.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Centrifuge
• Quantitative Immunoassay Analyzer (e.g., ACL TOP, Siemens
BCS XP)
• Calibrated Pipettes
• Timer
• Specimen Storage Refrigerator (2-8°C)
Reagents:
• D-Dimer assay kit (e.g., Innovance® D-DIMER Assay)
• Calibrators and Controls
• Distilled water
1. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Ensure all equipment is calibrated and ready for use.
2. Verify that all reagents are within the expiration date and have
been stored as per manufacturer’s instructions.
3. Allow all reagents and specimens to reach room temperature
prior to analysis.
Assay Procedure:
1. Load the plasma samples, calibrators, and controls onto the
analyzer as per manufacturer’s guidelines.
2. Ensure adequate volumes and proper placement in the sample
rack.
3. Select the D-Dimer assay protocol on the Analyzer.
4. Initiate the run according to the instrument-specific operation
manual.
Calculation and Quality Control:
1. The analyzer will automatically calculate the D-Dimer
concentration in ng/mL fibrinogen equivalent units (FEU) based
on the calibration curve.
2. Verify the assay runs by analyzing low, medium, and high
control levels to ensure the values fall within the prescribed
acceptable ranges.
3. Investigate and troubleshoot any controls that fall outside the
acceptable range before proceeding with patient specimen
analysis.
4. REPORTING RESULTS
5. Results are automatically transmitted to the Laboratory
Information System (LIS) for verification and entry by the
technologist.
6. Reference Intervals:
◦ D-Dimer: <500 ng/mL FEU (individual labs should verify
based on their population).
7. Document and review all critical values immediately:
◦ Critical Result: >500 ng/mL FEU (dependent on institutional
protocols).
8. QUALITY CONTROL
9. Perform quality control checks daily and with each new kit lot
number following manufacturer instructions.
10. Record (document) all QC results in the appropriate logs for
future reference.
11. Follow appropriate troubleshooting procedures for out-of-range
QC results and consult a supervisor as necessary.
