Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of D-
Lactate, Plasma
1. PURPOSE
This SOP describes the procedure for the analysis of D-Lactate in
plasma specimens using a validated assay method. The main aim is
to ensure accuracy, reliability, and reproducibility of results while
maintaining compliance with regulatory standards.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of trained laboratory personnel to follow this
procedure. Supervisors are responsible for ensuring all staff are
adequately trained and adhere to the outlined protocol.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred: Plasma from EDTA or heparinized blood.
• Volume: Minimum of 1 mL of plasma is required.
• Handling: Specimen should be centrifuged within 30 minutes of
collection at 1500 x g for 10 minutes at 4°C to separate plasma.
Plasma should be immediately aliquoted into a clean tube and
kept on ice or stored at -80°C if analysis is not performed within 2
hours.
1. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes and tips
• Microcentrifuge tubes
• Ice or -80°C freezer
• D-Lactate Assay Kit (validated commercial kit or validated in-
house method)
• Spectrophotometer or plate reader
1. REAGENTS
• D-Lactate Assay Reagents from the selected assay kit
• Quality control materials (low, medium, high D-Lactate
concentrations)
• Calibrators/Standards for D-Lactate
• Deionized water
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation
1. Thaw plasma samples on ice if previously frozen.
2. Prepare reagents according to the assay kit instructions.
3. Calibrate the spectrophotometer or plate reader per
manufacturer instructions.
B. Assay Procedure
1. Pipette appropriate volumes of calibrators, controls, and plasma
samples into microcentrifuge tubes or assay plate wells in
duplicate/triplicate as required.
2. Add the specific reagents to each tube or well following the
manufacturer’s instructions.
3. Incubate for the specified time period (typically around 30
minutes) at room temperature, protected from light.
4. Measure the absorbance at the specified wavelength (e.g., 450
nm) using a spectrophotometer or plate reader.
C. Quality Control
1. Include quality control samples (low, medium, and high) in each
analytical run.
2. Review the quality control results to ensure they fall within the
acceptable ranges.
3. DATA ANALYSIS
4. Generate a standard curve from the absorbance readings of the
D-Lactate calibrators.
5. Determine the concentration of D-Lactate in the plasma
samples by interpolating their absorbance readings against the
standard curve.
6. Use appropriate software or calculations according to the assay
kit instructions to derive the final results.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
8. Record the results in the laboratory information system (LIS) for
review and verification.
9. Compare the obtained results against the reference range:
◦ D-Lactate, plasma: 0.1-1.0 mmol/L (reference interval can
vary based on population and method).
10. Ensure results are verified by a technologist before
transmission.
11. QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE
12. Monitor equipment calibration regularly.
13. Verify the assay method’s performance periodically with
proficiency testing samples.
14. Address any out-of-range control results. Revalidate the assay
if necessary.
