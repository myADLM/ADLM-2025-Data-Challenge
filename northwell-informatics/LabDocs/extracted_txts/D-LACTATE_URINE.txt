Standard Operating Procedure for the Analysis of D-Lactate in
Urine
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the procedure to quantitatively measure D-Lactate
levels in urine specimens to ensure accurate and consistent
laboratory results.
2. SCOPE
This procedure is applicable to all trained personnel performing D-
Lactate analysis on urine specimens in the laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITIES
It is the responsibility of all laboratory personnel to follow this SOP
accurately and to ensure that all documentation is complete and
correct. If any issues or uncertainties arise during the procedure,
personnel must consult a supervisor.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Urine
• Specimen Volume: Minimum 5 mL of urine.
• Collection and Transport: Urine should be collected in a sterile
container and sent to the laboratory on ice within 4 hours of
collection.
• Storage: If immediate analysis is not possible, store urine at
2-8°C for up to 24 hours. For longer storage, specimens should
be frozen at -20°C or lower.
5. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Equipment:
◦ Centrifuge
◦ Pipettes and pipette tips
◦ Analytical balance
◦ Spectrophotometer or a biochemical analyzer capable of
measuring D-Lactate
◦ Water bath at 37°C (if necessary)
• Reagents:
◦ D-Lactate assay kit (acquire kits from a certified supplier,
follow specific instructions provided in the kit)
◦ Controls and calibrators specific for D-Lactate
◦ Deionized water
6. QUALITY CONTROL
Run quality control samples with each batch of patient samples:
• Levels: Perform quality control at a minimum of two levels: low
and high
• Frequency: Perform quality controls at the beginning of each
analytical run and after every 20 samples.
• Documentation: Record all quality control results on the QC log
7. PROCEDURE
Step 1: Sample Preparation
• Allow urine specimens to come to room temperature.
• Vortex specimens to ensure uniformity.
• Centrifuge urine specimens at 1500 x g for 10 minutes to remove
any particulate matter.
Step 2: Calibration and Quality Control
• Calibrate the spectrophotometer or biochemical analyzer as per
the manufacturer's instructions.
• Prepare controls and calibrators as per D-Lactate assay kit
instructions and analyze them to ensure proper performance
before analyzing patient samples.
Step 3: Analysis
• Follow the instructions provided in the D-Lactate assay kit
carefully.
◦ Reagent Preparation: Prepare reagents fresh as per the kit's
instructions.
◦ Reaction Setup: Pipette specified volumes of reagents and
urine samples (as per kit instructions) into individual wells or
test tubes.
◦ Incubation: Incubate reaction mixtures as specified by the kit
manufacturer, typically at 37°C for a defined duration.
◦ Measurement: Measure the absorbance at the specified
wavelength using a spectrophotometer or biochemical
analyzer.
Step 4: Result Calculation
• Calculate D-Lactate concentrations in urine samples using the
calibration curve derived from the standards.
◦ Refer to the assay kit’s instructions for specific details on how
to create and use the calibration curve.
8. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
• Reference Ranges:
◦ Normal: 0.05 – 0.25 mmol/L
◦ High D-Lactate levels might indicate abnormal gut flora
activity, impaired renal function, and other metabolic
conditions.
• Ensure results are within the assay's linearity range. If a result is
outside this range, dilution of the sample and reanalysis might be
necessary.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
• Review all results before entering them into the laboratory
information system (LIS).
• Document any deviation from the procedure and consult with the
supervisor if the deviation affects the validity of the results.
• Ensure critical values are communicated to the referring clinician
promptly as per laboratory guidelines.
10. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to the assay kit’s instructions for specific details on
limitations such as interference from other substances within the
urine.
• Ensure no cross-reactivity with other analytes that may cause
spurious results.
11. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions from the D-Lactate assay kit.
• Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines.
12. DOCUMENTATION
• All results, calibrations, and QC results must be recorded in the
respective logs.
• Record maintenance must adhere to the laboratory’s record
retention policy.
