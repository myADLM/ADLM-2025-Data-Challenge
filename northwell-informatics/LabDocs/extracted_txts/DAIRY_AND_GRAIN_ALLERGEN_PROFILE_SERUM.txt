DAIRY AND GRAIN ALLERGEN PROFILE, SERUM
Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
DATE: [Date]
REVIEWED BY: [Reviewer Name]
APPROVED BY: [Approver Name]
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standard method for the analysis and generation of
results for the Dairy and Grain Allergen Profile in serum samples to
ensure accurate and consistent reporting.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to the testing of serum samples for dairy and
grain allergens, performed in the Immunology section of the
laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
Qualified laboratory personnel are responsible for performing and
documenting the analysis as described in this SOP. It is the
responsibility of the laboratory supervisor to ensure that all personnel
are trained on this procedure and that the equipment and reagents
used are calibrated and maintained according to the laboratory's
quality assurance policies.
4. DEFINITIONS
• Allergen: A substance that can cause an allergic reaction.
• Dairy Allergens: Common allergens found in milk and dairy
products, such as casein, whey, lactoglobulin, and lactalbumin.
• Grain Allergens: Common allergens found in grains, including
wheat, rye, barley, and oats.
• Serum: The clear, yellowish fluid portion of blood that remains
after coagulation.
5. EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS
• ELISA reader and washer
• Microplate incubator
• Pipettes and tips
• Vortex mixer
• Gloves and lab coat
• ELISA kits for Dairy and Grain allergens
• Calibration and control sera
• Microcentrifuge
• Timer
6. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• ELISA plates pre-coated with specific dairy and grain allergens
• Wash buffer
• Substrate solution
• Stop solution
• Calibration standards
• Quality control sera
• Diluent buffer
• Serum samples
7. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen: Serum
• Volume: A minimum of 1 mL of serum is required.
• Collection: Serum collected in a red-top tube (no additives) or
SST tube.
• Stability: Specimens should be refrigerated at 2-8°C for up to 72
hours. For longer storage, freeze at -20°C or colder.
8. PROCEDURE
8.1. Preparation
• Ensure all equipment is calibrated and functioning properly.
• Thaw frozen serum samples and bring them to room temperature.
• Prepare reagents and wash buffer according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
• Label the ELISA plate wells for standards, controls, and patient
samples.
8.2. Reagent Preparation
• Prepare wash buffer according to the kit instructions.
• Prepare substrate and stop solutions just before use.
• Dilute serum samples 1:10 in diluent buffer unless otherwise
specified by the kit manufacturer.
8.3. Standard and Control Preparation
• Reconstitute and prepare calibration standards as directed.
• Include at least two levels of quality control sera in each run
(positive and negative controls).
8.4. Assay Procedure
• Add 100 μL of standards, controls, and diluted serum samples to
designated wells.
• Incubate the plate at 37°C for the time specified in the kit
instructions.
• Wash the plate 3 times with wash buffer.
• Add 100 μL of conjugate (enzyme-labeled secondary antibody) to
each well and incubate as directed.
• Wash the plate 3-5 times with wash buffer.
• Add 100 μL of substrate solution to each well and incubate in the
dark for the specified time until the color develops.
• Add 50-100 μL of stop solution to each well.
• Read the absorbance using an ELISA reader at the appropriate
wavelength (typically 450 nm).
8.5. Calculations and Result Generation
• Generate a standard curve by plotting the absorbance of the
calibration standards against their concentrations.
• Calculate the concentrations of allergens in the patient samples
by interpolating their absorbance values on the standard curve.
9. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run quality control sera with each batch of patient samples.
• Validate results against the expected ranges of control sera.
• If controls are out of range, repeat the assay and investigate
possible root causes.
10. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
• Allergens are reported in units specific to the assay (e.g., kU/L).
• Values exceeding the defined threshold for positivity indicate a
potential allergy to the specific dairy or grain allergen.
11. REPORTING RESULTS
• Verify and review results against the quality control data.
• Report results in the laboratory information system (LIS)
according to site-specific guidelines.
• Include interpretative comments as necessary based on clinical
thresholds and standards.
12. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Results are dependent on the quality of the serum sample and
adherence to the assay protocol.
• Cross-reactivity with other allergens can occur and should be
considered in the clinical context.
