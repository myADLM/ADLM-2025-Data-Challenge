Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for DANDELION, IGE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
This SOP aims to outline the procedure for the analytical phase of
testing for Immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels in serum using the
DANDELION immunoassay system. This covers all steps required to
ensure accurate and precise results and proper documentation as
per CLIA guidelines.
Responsibility:
• Designated staff must perform the procedures as defined in this
SOP.
• It is the responsibility of all staff to identify any deficiencies in the
analytical process that may affect laboratory test results and
report them to the supervisor immediately.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring that all staff are trained
and that procedures are followed correctly.
1. DEFINITION
IgE: Immunoglobulin E, a class of antibody that plays a crucial role in
allergic reactions.
1. PROCEDURE
A) Pre-Analytical Check:
1. Verify that the specimen has been correctly accessioned and
assigned a unique identifier.
2. Ensure that the serum specimen is properly stored and within
the accepted stability period (typically within 7 days when
stored at 2-8°C or frozen at -20°C).
B) Equipment and Reagent Preparation:
1. DANDELION Immunoassay Analyzer: Verify that the analyzer is
calibrated, and maintenance checks are up-to-date.
2. Reagents:
◦ Ensure reagents (calibrators, controls, and IgE detection
reagents) are stored according to manufacturer instructions
and are within their expiration dates.
◦ Equilibrate all reagents to room temperature if required
before use.
3. Supplies: Ensure that all necessary supplies (pipettes, tubes,
tips, gloves, etc.) are available and ready for use.
C) Analytical Phase:
1. Sample Loading:
◦ Allow the serum specimen to come to room temperature if it
has been refrigerated or thaw frozen specimens completely.
◦ Inspect the serum for hemolysis, lipemia, or icterus, and
note any abnormalities.
◦ Load the appropriate amount of serum specimen into
designated sample cups.
◦ Place the loaded samples onto the DANDELION analyzer’s
sample carousel.
2. Reagent Loading:
◦ Load the required reagents, calibrators, and controls into the
appropriate positions on the analyzer.
3. Program Assay:
◦ Input the test specifics into the analyzer software.
◦ Select the IgE test, and link the patient specimen IDs with
their corresponding sample cups.
4. Run Assay:
◦ Initiate the assay run as per the manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Ensure the system completes the incubation and read
phases without interruption.
5. Result Verification:
◦ Once the assay is completed, review the raw data and
ensure QC parameters have passed.
◦ If QC fails, troubleshoot per the instrument’s guidelines,
repeat calibration if necessary, and re-run the control and
patient samples.
6. Quality Control:
◦ Run QC materials (low, medium, high) to verify assay
performance.
◦ Document all QC results, including any corrective actions
taken.
D) Post-Analytical Phase:
1. Data Entry and Validation:
◦ Transfer results to the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
◦ Verify results against established reference ranges.
◦ Flag and review any results that fall outside of these ranges.
◦ Ensure that all results are validated by authorized personnel
before reporting.
2. Result Reporting:
◦ Report IgE results accurately in the patient's record.
◦ Document any deviations, maintenance issues, or reagent
problems in the laboratory log.
3. Archiving Samples:
◦ Store remaining serum specimens in a designated area at
the appropriate temperature as required for possible repeat
analysis.
◦ Retain specimens according to laboratory protocol for
specimen retention.
E) Troubleshooting and Maintenance:
1. Instrument Malfunctions:
◦ Follow manufacturer guidelines for troubleshooting minor
issues.
◦ Contact technical support for significant instrument
malfunctions.
◦ Document all issues and resolutions in the maintenance log.
2. Routine Maintenance:
◦ Perform routine maintenance of the DANDELION
Immunoassay Analyzer as per the manufacturer’s
guidelines.
◦ Document all maintenance activities.
3. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• IgE (Serum): Typically less than 150 kU/L, though precise ranges
may vary based on the patient population and equipment
calibration. Refer to manufacturer guidelines and local validation
studies for specific reference intervals.
