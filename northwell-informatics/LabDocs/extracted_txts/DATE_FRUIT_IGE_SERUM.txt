Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase:
Immunoglobulin E (IgE) Testing for Specific Allergen "Date
Fruit" in Serum
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to provide standardized procedures for
the analysis of Immunoglobulin E (IgE) specific to the Date Fruit
allergen in serum samples. This procedure ensures consistent,
accurate, and reliable test results for clinical diagnostics.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing,
documenting, and validating the IgE testing procedure as
described.
• It is the responsibility of all staff involved to identify any issues in
the testing process and report them to the supervisor.
• Staff and supervisors are responsible for reviewing quality control
data and ensuring compliance with this SOP.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Acceptable Specimen:
• Serum: Recommend using a serum separator tube (SST). Serum
should be separated from the cells within 2 hours of collection.
• Minimum volume: 0.5 mL of serum.
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Specimens with visible hemolysis, lipemia, icterus, or particulate
matter.
• Specimens collected in anticoagulant tubes (e.g., EDTA, citrate,
etc.).
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• IgE-specific allergen testing kit (specific for Date Fruit allergen)
• Microplate reader capable of reading at the appropriate
wavelength (if using an ELISA-based method)
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes and tips
• Calibrated laboratory balance
• Personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves, lab coat,
and safety goggles
• Reagents as specified by the manufacturer (e.g., buffer solutions,
substrate, wash solution)
• Control materials (positive and negative controls)
1. PROCEDURE
A) Sample Preparation:
1. Allow serum samples to reach room temperature before
analysis.
2. Mix the serum sample thoroughly by gentle inversion.
B) IgE Testing Procedure:
1. Label the microplate wells according to the number of samples
and controls to be analyzed.
2. Add assay buffer to each well (as specified by the testing kit
protocol).
3. Pipette the specified volume (usually 50-100 μL) of each serum
sample, positive control, and negative control into the
appropriate wells.
4. Incubate the microplate for the specified time and temperature
(follow manufacturer’s instructions).
5. Wash the wells with the wash solution as instructed in the kit
protocol to remove any unbound components.
6. Add detection antibody to each well and incubate for the
specified time.
7. Wash the wells again to remove unbound detection antibody.
8. Add the substrate solution to each well and incubate for the
specified time, protecting from light as directed.
9. Stop the reaction by adding the stop solution as per the
manufacturer's instructions.
10. Read the absorbance of each well using a microplate reader at
the specified wavelength.
C) Result Calculation:
1. Calculate the concentration of specific IgE in each sample
based on the standard curve established with the controls.
2. Use the manufacturer's software or manual calculations as
described in the kit insert.
3. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform quality control procedures with each batch of assays.
This includes running positive and negative controls as per the
manufacturer’s guidelines.
• Record the results of the quality control samples and assess if
they fall within the established ranges.
• If controls are out of range, do not report patient results and
troubleshoot the cause. Repeat the analysis after resolving any
issues.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results should be entered into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS) following the laboratory protocols.
• Results should be reviewed and verified by a technologist before
being released.
• Report the specific IgE results in kU/L with reference ranges
provided by the testing kit.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Refer to the testing kit instructions or laboratory-specific
guidelines for the reference intervals for specific IgE levels for the
Date Fruit allergen.
1. LIMITATIONS
• The results of this test should be interpreted in conjunction with
the patient's clinical history and other diagnostic tests.
• High levels of cross-reactive carbohydrate determinants (CCD) in
some patients can result in false positives.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If the assay does not perform as expected, review the procedure
for potential errors in sample handling, reagent preparation, or
incubation times.
• Re-run controls and samples if necessary to ensure reliability.
