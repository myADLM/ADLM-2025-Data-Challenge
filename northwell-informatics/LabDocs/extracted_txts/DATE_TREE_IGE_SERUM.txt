STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP) FOR GENERATING
RESULTS FOR DATE, TREE, IGE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedures for generating
laboratory results for specific serum tests related to DATE (detailed
assay for tree pollen), TREE (tree pollen identification), and IgE
(Immunoglobulin E) levels in serum. This procedure aims to ensure
accuracy, reliability, and consistency in testing results while adhering
to CLIA standards.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory scientists are responsible for performing the
serum tests and documenting the results as defined in this
procedure. Supervisors are responsible for overseeing the process to
ensure adherence to SOP and handling any issues or quality control
measures that may arise.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen:
• SERUM: The preferred specimen is serum obtained from a SST
(Serum Separator Tube). As per standard blood collection
protocols, specimens must be spun, separated, and ideally stored
at 2-8°C until analysis.
1. EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS
• ELISA Reader or other appropriate Immunoassay Analyzer
• Centrifuge
• Micropipettes
• Calibrated thermometers for temperature monitoring
• Incubator (if specified by the assay procedure)
• Reagents and controls as provided by assay kit manufacturers
(e.g., for serum IgE analysis)
1. PROCEDURE
4.1 PRE-ANALYSIS PREPARATION:
• Ensure all reagents are within expiration date and properly stored
as per manufacturer guidelines.
• Bring all reagents to room temperature before use, unless
otherwise specified.
• Prepare control samples as per the kit instructions for both
positive and negative controls.
4.2 SPECIMEN PREPARATION:
• Allow serum specimens to reach room temperature before
analysis.
• Confirm specimen integrity to avoid hemolysis and contamination.
• Label and organize specimens to ensure proper identity tracking
throughout the testing process.
4.3 ANALYTICAL PROCESS:
DATE (Tree Pollen Assay):
• Follow the specific kit instructions for the tree pollen panel.
• Utilize the ELISA reader or appropriate analyzer for detecting tree
pollen-specific antibodies.
• Perform steps including washing, incubation, aspiration, and
reading as per the kit instructions.
• Ensure all measurements adhere to specified optical density
ranges for acceptance.
TREE (Tree Pollen Identification):
• Employ immunoassay or similar techniques to identify tree pollen
types.
• Follow specified assay steps including sample preparation,
incubation, and result generation.
• Confirm identification of tree pollen against calibration standards
provided.
IgE (Immunoglobulin E Serum Levels):
• Use an appropriate immunoassay kit for IgE quantification.
• Ensure pipetting precision for sample and reagent volumes.
• Follow kit-specific steps including incubation times, washing
sequences, and measurement.
• Calculate IgE levels using the standard curve generated through
the assay and cross-verify with controls.
4.4 MONITORING AND DOCUMENTATION:
• Temperature Monitoring: Ensure all equipment, including
incubation temperatures, are monitored and documented daily.
• Logging Results: Record all generated results in laboratory
information systems (LIS) accurately. Document results, date of
testing, analyst initials, and any noted deviations.
• Verification: Cross-check results against control samples. Any
anomalies must be noted and corrective action documented.
4.5 QUALITY CONTROL:
• Perform internal quality control using control samples provided in
the kits.
• Validate results periodically with external quality control methods
as mandated by CLIA standards.
• Ensure calibration standards and equipment maintenance checks
are regularly performed.
4.6 TROUBLESHOOTING:
• Address temperature control alarms or deviations immediately.
• Repeat any assay where control measures fail or results are
inconsistent.
• Notify supervisor for any persistent issues or equipment
malfunctions.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results must be reviewed and verified before final reporting.
• Critical values and abnormal results should prompt immediate
notification to the relevant healthcare provider based on
institutional guidelines.
• Document any comments or limitations associated with the results
clearly in the report.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s product inserts for DATE, TREE, and IgE test kits.
• CLIA regulations and standards for laboratory testing.
• Internal laboratory quality assurance protocols.
This SOP ensures that the analytical phase for DATE, TREE, and IgE
serum testing is carried out consistently and reliably, with adherence
to high standards of laboratory practice. All procedures should be
performed with careful attention to detail and documented
appropriately to ensure the integrity of laboratory test results and
patient safety.
