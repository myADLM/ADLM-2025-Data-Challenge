Protocol for the Analytical Phase of Generating Results for
DECORIN/CHONDROITIN SULFATE ANTIBODY Testing
1. Purpose:
To provide a standardized procedure for the analysis and
generation of results for Decorin/Chondroitin Sulfate Antibody
(DCSA) tests to ensure accuracy, consistency, and reliability of
test results.
2. Specimen Requirements and Stability:
◦ Specimen Type: Serum or plasma.
◦ Collection:
▪ Preferred: 5 mL of whole blood collected in a serum
separator tube (SST) or a plasma separator tube (PST).
▪ Alternative: 5 mL of whole blood collected in an EDTA or
heparinized vacutainer tube.
◦ Handling:
▪ Blood samples should be centrifuged promptly at
2000-3000 rpm for 10-15 minutes to separate the serum
or plasma.
▪ Aliquot the clear supernatant (serum or plasma) into
labeled polypropylene tubes.
◦ Storage:
▪ Specimens should be stored at 2-8°C if analysis is to be
performed within 48 hours.
▪ For delayed analysis, specimens must be frozen at
-20°C or lower. Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
3. Reagents and Supplies:
◦ Decorin/Chondroitin Sulfate ELISA kit (or equivalent) with
associated buffers, standards, and controls.
◦ Microcentrifuge tubes.
◦ Micropipettes (10-1000 μL) and disposable tips.
◦ Laboratory timer.
◦ Plate reader capable of measuring absorbance at 450 nm
(and reference filter at 620-650 nm if required).
4. Quality Control:
◦ Use both high and low-level control sera provided with the
ELISA kit to ensure assay accuracy.
◦ Run controls in duplicate along with patient samples in each
assay batch.
◦ Acceptable control ranges should be documented according
to the manufacturer's instructions. Controls must fall within
these ranges for the assay results to be valid.
◦ Document all quality control results in the QC log.
5. Procedure:
Sample Preparation:
◦ Thaw frozen samples at room temperature and mix gently.
Centrifuge if necessary to remove particulates.
◦ Dilute the patient serum or plasma sample as recommended
by the ELISA kit manufacturer (typically 1:100 or 1:200
dilution).
Assay Procedure:
1. Prepare reagents and standards according to the
manufacturer's instructions. Include blank, standards,
controls, and patient samples in duplicate.
2. Add 100 μL of standards, controls, and diluted patient
samples to the designated wells on the microtiter
plate.
3. Incubate the plate at 37°C for 1 hour (or as specified by
the kit).
4. Wash the plate thoroughly with the wash buffer, typically
4-5 washes per the kit protocol.
5. Add 100 μL of enzyme conjugate reagent to each well.
6. Incubate the plate at room temperature (typically
20-25°C) for 30 minutes (or as specified by the kit).
7. Wash the plate again as per the protocol.
8. Add 100 μL of TMB substrate to each well. Incubate in
the dark at room temperature for 15-30 minutes, checking
color development.
9. Stop the reaction by adding 50 μL of stop solution to
each well.
10. Read the absorbance at 450 nm within 30 minutes of
stopping the reaction using a microplate reader.
6. Calculations and Data Interpretation:
◦ Calculate the mean absorbance for each set of standards,
controls, and patient samples.
◦ Plot the standard curve using the standard absorbance
values and corresponding concentrations.
◦ Use the standard curve to determine the concentration of
Decorin/Chondroitin Sulfate Antibody in patient samples.
◦ Ensure all calculated concentrations are within assay range
limits. Dilute and re-assay samples with concentrations
above the highest standard.
7. Reporting Results:
◦ Results are reported in ng/mL (or μg/mL as required by
clinical needs).
◦ Record patient results with corresponding control results.
◦ Enter and review results in the Laboratory Information
System (LIS). Flag any results exceeding reference ranges
for further review by a pathologist.
◦ Critical results should be reported immediately to the
requesting physician following laboratory protocols.
8. Method Limitations:
◦ Hemolysis, lipemia, and icteric samples may interfere with
assay results.
◦ Ensure all samples and reagents are at room temperature
before commencing the assay.
◦ Follow manufacturer’s instructions precisely for accurate
results.

This protocol ensures the accurate and reliable determination of
Decorin/Chondroitin Sulfate Antibody levels in clinical samples,
helping provide essential diagnostic information.
