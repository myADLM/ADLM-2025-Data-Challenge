Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Dedicator of Cytokinesis 8 (DOCK8)
Deficiency, Blood
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the standardized procedure for the analytical
phase of generating results for Dedicator of Cytokinesis 8 (DOCK8)
deficiency in blood samples. The procedure includes DNA extraction,
polymerase chain reaction (PCR), sequencing, and data analysis to
ensure accurate and reliable results.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing
the procedures outlined in this SOP.
• All laboratory staff must be vigilant in detecting any deviations
from the procedure and inform the supervisor immediately.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type:
• Whole blood collected in EDTA (lavender top) tube.
Specimen Stability:
• Samples must be kept at 2-8°C and processed within 7 days of
collection.
• If immediate processing is not possible, samples can be stored at
-20°C for up to one month.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, clotted, or improperly labeled specimens.
• Samples that have been stored at room temperature for more
than 24 hours without processing.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
Equipment:
• Centrifuge
• Microcentrifuge tubes
• Pipettes and tips
• Thermal cycler (PCR machine)
• Sequencing machine (e.g., Sanger sequencer)
• Gel electrophoresis apparatus
Reagents:
• DNA extraction kit
• Primers specific for DOCK8 gene
• PCR reaction mix (including DNA polymerase, dNTPs, and buffer)
• Agarose gel and staining solution
• Sequencing kit and reagents
1. PROCEDURE
A) DNA Extraction:
1. Isolation of Genomic DNA:
◦ Mix 200 µL of whole blood with the lysis buffer as specified
in the DNA extraction kit.
◦ Follow the manufacturer's instructions for the extraction kit
to isolate genomic DNA.
◦ Quantify and assess the purity of the extracted DNA using a
spectrophotometer or Nanodrop.
B) Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR):
1. PCR Setup:
◦ Prepare the PCR reaction mix: 1x PCR buffer, 0.2 mM each
dNTP, 0.2 µM of each primer, 1 µL of DNA template, and 1
unit of Taq DNA polymerase in a total volume of 25 µL.
◦ Set up the thermal cycler with the following conditions:
▪ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 5 minutes
▪ 35 cycles of:
▪ Denaturation: 95°C for 30 seconds
▪ Annealing: 55-60°C (depending on the primers) for
30 seconds
▪ Extension: 72°C for 1 minute
▪ Final extension: 72°C for 7 minutes
C) Gel Electrophoresis:
1. Product Verification:
◦ Prepare a 1-2% agarose gel with appropriate staining
solution.
◦ Load 5 µL of the PCR product along with a DNA ladder into
the wells of the gel.
◦ Run the electrophoresis at 100 volts for approximately 30
minutes.
◦ Visualize the PCR products under UV light to confirm the
expected size.
D) Sequencing:
1. Preparation and Sequencing:
◦ Purify the confirmed PCR product using a PCR purification
kit.
◦ Set up a sequencing reaction using the purified PCR
product and specific sequencing primers.
◦ Load the sequencing reaction onto the sequencing machine
and follow the manufacturer’s instructions for the
sequencing protocol.
E) Data Analysis:
1. Sequence Analysis:
◦ Retrieve the sequencing data and analyze the sequences
using bioinformatics tools.
◦ Align the sequences to the reference DOCK8 gene
sequence to identify any mutations or deletions.
◦ Verify and interpret the detected variants based on
established guidelines.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Review the sequencing and alignment results.
• Confirm the identified variants by cross-referencing with patient
history and previous results.
• Document and report the final results in the laboratory information
system (LIS).
Critical Results:
• Variants classified as pathogenic or likely pathogenic should be
reported to the clinician immediately.
• Maintain proper documentation of the communication.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform internal and external controls with each batch of
samples.
• Ensure that all equipment is regularly calibrated and maintained.
• Document any deviations from the procedure, and corrective
actions should be taken promptly.
1. REFERENCES
Include references to relevant literature, manufacturer’s instructions,
and clinical guidelines for DOCK8 deficiency analysis.
This SOP must be reviewed and approved by the laboratory
supervisor and updated annually or as necessary to reflect changes
in clinical guidelines or technological advancements.
