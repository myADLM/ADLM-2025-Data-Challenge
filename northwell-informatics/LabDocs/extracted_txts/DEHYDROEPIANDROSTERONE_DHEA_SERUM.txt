Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), Serum
1. PURPOSE
To provide standardized instructions for the analysis of
Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) levels in serum samples using the
designated immunoassay analyzer and to ensure the accuracy,
reliability, and timely reporting of results.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all certified laboratory personnel trained to
perform and report DHEA serum analysis.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for:
• Performing the DHEA assay according to this SOP.
• Ensuring that all equipment is in proper working order.
• Producing accurate and reliable results.
• Documenting all steps and observations.
• Notifying supervisors of any deviations or issues encountered.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type:
• Serum, collected in a standard SST (Serum Separator Tube).
Specimen Collection:
• Collect blood using standard venipuncture technique, allowing for
proper clotting and serum formation.
• After collection, allow the blood to clot at room temperature for 30
minutes and then centrifuge at 1500-2000 x g for 10-15 minutes.
Transport and Storage:
• Transport serum at 2-8°C for short-term storage (up to 24 hours).
• For long-term storage, freeze serum samples at -20°C or lower.
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic or icteric samples.
• Specimens not properly labeled or without collection date/time.
5. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
Equipment:
• Immunoassay analyzer compatible with the DHEA assay.
• Centrifuge for serum separation.
• Pipettes with appropriate volumes (e.g., 10-100 µL, 100-1000 µL).
• Refrigerator and freezer for specimen storage.
Reagents:
• DHEA calibrators and controls.
• DHEA immunoassay kit specific to the immunoassay analyzer.
• Deionized or distilled water for reagent preparation.
6. PROCEDURE
A) Calibration and Quality Control:
1. Perform calibration of the immunoassay analyzer using the
provided DHEA calibrators following the manufacturer’s
instructions.
2. Run quality control samples (high, medium, low) at the start of
each analytical run or shift to ensure the assay’s accuracy.
3. Document QC results in the QC log and verify if the controls are
within the acceptable range before proceeding with patient
samples. If controls are out of range, troubleshoot and resolve
issues prior to specimen testing.
B) Sample Analysis:
1. Prepare the immunoassay analyzer for operation, ensuring it
has passed all startup and calibration checks.
2. Pipette the required volume of the serum sample into the
sample cup or tube as per the immunoassay kit instructions.
3. Load the sample rack into the analyzer and select the DHEA
assay protocol.
4. Start the analysis and monitor the analyzer for any error
messages or issues.
5. Upon completion, review the results for accuracy and record
the data in the laboratory information system (LIS).
C) Reporting Results:
1. Results will be automatically transmitted to the LIS and a
preliminary review will be performed by the technologist.
2. Verify the results by checking:
◦ The consistency of the DHEA values within the control and
calibration ranges.
◦ The presence of any flags or warning messages from the
analyzer.
3. Flag and review any critical values or discrepancies.
4. Report verified results to the patient's electronic medical record
(EMR) and document results in the LIS.
7. REFERENCE INTERVALS AND LIMITATIONS
Reference Intervals:
• Reference intervals are method-specific and should be obtained
from the kit insert or established through validation studies.
• Typical reference ranges for DHEA in adults:
◦ Males: 1.3 – 9.8 µmol/L
◦ Females: 0.9 – 6.8 µmol/L
Limitations:
• Ensure proper sample handling to avoid hemolysis, lipemia, or
icterus which can interfere with the assay.
• Highly elevated concentrations of substances that structurally
resemble DHEA, such as 17-hydroxyprogesterone, can potentially
cause cross-reactivity.
• Refer to the assay kit insert for specific limitations.
8. TROUBLESHOOTING
If unexpected results or analyzer errors occur:
1. Confirm the quality of reagents and calibrators is within
expiration dates.
2. Re-run an aliquot of the sample.
3. Check and perform maintenance as needed on the analyzer.
4. Repeat the analysis with fresh reagents and quality controls.
5. Consult with the supervisor if troubleshooting steps do not
resolve the issue.
9. RECORD KEEPING AND DOCUMENTATION
Ensure the following documentation is complete and accurate:
• Calibration and QC records for each analytical run.
• Quality control logs with lot numbers and expiration dates.
• Patient result logs with date and time of analysis.
• Maintenance and troubleshooting records for the immunoassay
analyzer.

• Laboratory's Quality Management System documentation.
This SOP ensures standardization and compliance with laboratory
best practices for the analytical phase of generating DHEA serum
results. All personnel must adhere to this protocol to maintain test
accuracy and reliability.
