Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) : Determination of
Dehydroepiandrosterone Sulfate (DHEA-S) in Serum
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized approach to the quantification and
reporting of Dehydroepiandrosterone Sulfate (DHEA-S) levels in
serum samples to ensure accuracy and consistency of results.
2. DEFINITION
Dehydroepiandrosterone Sulfate (DHEA-S) is a steroid hormone
produced by the adrenal cortex, gonads, and brain. It serves as a
precursor to sex steroids and is measured in serum to evaluate
adrenal function and diagnose various disorders.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated clinical laboratory scientists are responsible for
performing the assay, documenting results, ensuring the quality of
results, and notifying the supervisor of any discrepancies or issues.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred Specimen:
• Serum collected in an SST (serum separator tube).
Acceptable Specimen:
• Serum collected in a red-top tube without anticoagulant, provided
it is centrifuged and the serum is separated promptly.
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Plasma samples.
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric specimens.
5. REAGENTS, EQUIPMENT, AND SUPPLIES
• Calibrators and Controls: Commercially available DHEA-S
calibrators and Quality Control (QC) materials.
• Reagents: Dehydroepiandrosterone Sulfate Assay Reagent Kit.
• Apparatus: Immunoassay analyzer or Liquid Chromatography-
Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS) system.
• Supplies: Pipettes, tips, sample cups, and appropriate waste
containers.
6. PROCEDURE
Sample Preparation:
1. Centrifuge the SST tube at 3000 RPM for 10 minutes to
separate the serum.
2. Carefully transfer the serum to a labeled sample cup, making
sure not to disturb any cell debris.
Assay Procedure:
• Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for the DHEA-S assay kit
being used.
Using Immunoassay Analyzer:
1. Ensure the analyzer is calibrated and maintenance has been
performed as per the manufacturer's guidelines.
2. Load the calibrators, QC materials, and patient samples into the
designated racks.
3. Program the analyzer for the specific DHEA-S assay and start
the run.
Using LC-MS System:
1. Prepare samples, calibrators, and controls by the kit’s protocol.
2. Inject the prepared samples onto the LC-MS system.
3. Follow the system's protocol for detecting and quantifying
DHEA-S.
Post-analysis:
1. Review the results generated by the analyzer.
2. Ensure all quality control results are within the acceptable
range. If any QC results are out of range, troubleshoot
according to the manufacturer's instructions and repeat the
assay if necessary.
3. Document the control results in the QC log.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Run Quality Controls at the beginning of each batch or at
intervals recommended by the manufacturer to monitor
accuracy and precision.
2. Acceptable ranges for each level of control must be established
and reviewed regularly.
3. Document all QC data and perform troubleshooting if any
control falls outside the accepted range.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Verify and validate the results in the LIS (Laboratory Information
System) before reporting.
2. Flag any critical results following the laboratory’s critical value
policy and inform the ordering physician immediately.
Reference Intervals:
• Adults:
◦ Males: 35-560 µg/dL
◦ Females: 40-325 µg/dL
• Reference ranges for pediatric and adolescent populations should
be obtained from the assay kit’s insert or from literature
references.
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
1. Ensure proper sample handling to avoid hemolysis, which can
affect results.
2. Cross-reactivity with other steroids should be reviewed in the
assay insert.
3. Results should be correlated with clinical findings and other
diagnostic procedures.
10. REFERENCES
1. Manufacturer's kit insert for the specific DHEA-S assay.
2. Relevant Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI)
guidelines.
3. Latest literature and clinical guidelines pertaining to DHEA-S
measurement and its clinical significance.
11. DOCUMENTATION
All steps, calibrations, QC checks, and any anomalies should be
recorded and maintained according to the laboratory’s documentation
policy.
This protocol ensures that all personnel follow a consistent
methodology for the determination of DHEA-S levels, thereby
maintaining the integrity and reliability of the results reported.
