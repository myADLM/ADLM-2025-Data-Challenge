Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Dehydroepiandrosterone Sulfate (DHEA-
S), Serum
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the steps and procedures
necessary for the accurate and consistent measurement of
Dehydroepiandrosterone Sulfate (DHEA-S) levels in serum samples.
The SOP ensures reliable, reproducible, and timely results while
maintaining compliance with CLIA standards.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for following this SOP
during the testing, documentation, and reporting of DHEA-S levels in
serum specimens. It is the responsibility of the supervisory personnel
to ensure adherence to this protocol, performing quality control,
proficiency testing, and timely addressing of any issues arising during
analysis.
3. DEFINITION
Dehydroepiandrosterone Sulfate (DHEA-S) is a sulfate ester of
dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), an endogenous steroid hormone
involved in the biosynthesis of androgens and estrogens.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred Specimen:
• Serum collected in a red-top tube or serum separator tube (SST).
• Volume: Minimum of 1 mL of serum.
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
• Missing or incorrect patient identification or labeling.
Specimen Stability:
• Refrigerated at 2-8°C for up to 7 days.
• Frozen at -20°C or lower for longer-term storage up to 3 months.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Automated immunoassay analyzer (e.g., Roche Cobas, Abbott
Architect)
• Centrifuge
• Micropipettes and tips
Reagents:
• DHEA-S assay reagent kit compatible with the immunoassay
analyzer
• Quality control material (2 levels: low, high)
• Calibrators
Supplies:
• Red-top tubes or SST
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
6. PROCEDURE
A. Pre-Analytical Steps:
1. Inspect the specimen for proper labeling, volume, and quality
(e.g., absence of hemolysis).
2. Allow the SST to clot and centrifuge at 1500-2000 x g for 10-15
minutes.
3. Transfer the serum to a clean polypropylene tube if necessary
and refrigerate if not proceeding immediately to analysis.
B. Analytical Steps:
1. Calibrate the immunoassay analyzer using the DHEA-S
calibrators following the manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Prepare and load the reagent packs into the analyzer.
3. Perform a daily quality control (QC) check using two levels of
QC material:
◦ If QC results fall within the established ranges, proceed with
testing.
◦ If QC results are out of range, troubleshoot the issue
according to the manufacturer’s guidelines and repeat the
QC until acceptable results are obtained.
4. Load the serum specimens onto the analyzer.
5. Enter the necessary patient information (e.g., sample ID, test
code) into the analyzer.
6. Initiate the analysis run according to the manufacturer's
protocol.
7. Monitor the run for any errors or flags and address any issues
as they arise.
C. Post-Analytical Steps:
1. Review the results generated by the analyzer.
◦ Evaluate the results for potential flags or errors that may
indicate analytical issues.
2. Verify and validate results in the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
3. Report results to the patient’s medical record following the
standard reporting procedure.
4. Document any issues, corrective actions, or deviations
encountered during testing.
5. Dispose of used consumables and waste following proper
biohazard protocols.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform and document QC as per the laboratory's QC program.
• Review QC results regularly to ensure continued accuracy and
reliability of test results.
• Participate in external proficiency testing programs.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to the manufacturer’s insert for specific assay limitations
and cross-reactivity information.
• Specimen quality issues such as hemolysis, lipemia, or icterus
can affect test results and should be addressed promptly.
9. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's insert for the DHEA-S assay reagent kit.
• CLIA regulations and guidelines.
• Laboratory internal quality control manuals and procedures.
This SOP ensures a consistent approach to testing serum DHEA-S
levels, maintaining high standards of accuracy and reliability
essential for clinical decision-making.
