STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP)
DELTA-8 AND DELTA-9-CARBOXY-TETRAHYDROCANNABINOL
(THC) CONFIRMATION, CHAIN OF CUSTODY, RANDOM, URINE
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized protocol for the analytical phase of
generating results for DELTA-8 and DELTA-9-Carboxy-
Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) confirmation in random urine
specimens, ensuring compliance with chain of custody requirements.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel involved in the
confirmation testing of DELTA-8 and DELTA-9-THC levels in urine
specimens received under chain of custody protocols.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Trained laboratory personnel are responsible for adhering to this
SOP.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring compliance and
addressing deviations.
4. DEFINITIONS
• Chain of Custody: The documented process that records the
custody, transfer, analysis, and disposition of a specimen.
• Delta-8-THC and Delta-9-THC: Cannabinoid metabolites
analyzed in this protocol.
• Confirmation Testing: A definitive analysis of a specimen to
quantitatively determine the presence of specific cannabinoids.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) or Liquid
Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS)
• Urine collection kits (chain of custody compliant)
• Certified reference materials for Delta-8 and Delta-9-THC
• Calibrators and control materials
• Internal standard solution
• Extraction solvents and reagents
• Analytical balance
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Vortex mixer
• Urine specimen containers
• Temperature-controlled storage
• Documentation logs and chain of custody forms
6. PROCEDURE
6.1 Specimen Reception and Accessioning
• Ensure all specimens have been collected, labelled, and
transported with proper chain of custody documentation.
• Upon receipt, log specimens into the laboratory information
system (LIS) and confirm that all chain of custody documentation
is complete.
• Assign a unique accession number to each specimen and ensure
correct labelling.
6.2 Specimen Preparation
• Inspect each specimen for integrity (e.g., adequate volume, no
visible contamination).
• Mix the urine specimen thoroughly.
• Aliquot a portion of the urine specimen into a new, labeled
container for analysis.
6.3 Calibration and Quality Control
• Prepare calibration standards and quality control samples using
certified reference materials.
• Perform calibration and quality control checks on the GC-MS or
LC-MS system according to manufacturer instructions.
• Document all calibration and quality control results.
6.4 Extraction and Sample Preparation
• Pipette the urine aliquot into an appropriate extraction container.
• Add internal standard solution to each sample.
• Perform liquid-liquid or solid-phase extraction to isolate THC
metabolites.
• Evaporate the extraction solvent and reconstitute the extract in an
appropriate solvent compatible with the analytical method.
• Transfer the reconstituted extract to autosampler vials for
analysis.
6.5 Instrumental Analysis
• Load the autosampler vials into the GC-MS or LC-MS system.
• Set up the analytical run in the instrument software, including the
sequence of calibration standards, quality control samples, and
specimens.
• Analyze samples according to the established method
parameters.
• Monitor the system for any deviations from expected performance
and take corrective action as needed.
6.6 Data Analysis and Result Reporting
• Review the chromatograms and mass spectra for each sample.
• Quantify the levels of Delta-8 and Delta-9-THC using the
calibration curve.
• Validate the results against quality control criteria.
• Enter the results into the LIS and review for accuracy.
• Ensure results are reviewed and verified by a qualified
technologist.
6.7 Chain of Custody Documentation
• Maintain all chain of custody documentation throughout the
analytical process.
• Ensure proper signing off by all personnel handling the
specimens.
• Store all documentation securely.
7. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If any specimen shows signs of contamination or tampering,
document the issue and notify the supervisor.
• For instrumental errors, follow manufacturer troubleshooting
guidelines and document all actions taken.
8. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s manuals for GC-MS/LC-MS systems.
• Certified reference material documentation.
• Chain of custody compliance guidelines.
