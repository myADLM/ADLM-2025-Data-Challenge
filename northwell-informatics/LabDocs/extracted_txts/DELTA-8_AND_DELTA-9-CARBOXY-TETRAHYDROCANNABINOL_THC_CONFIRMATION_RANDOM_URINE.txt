Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Delta-8 and Delta-9-
Carboxy-Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) Confirmation, Random,
Urine
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to provide standardized procedures for
the analysis and confirmation of Delta-8 and Delta-9-Carboxy-
Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in random urine samples. This
procedure is intended to validate the presence of these cannabinoids
and ensure the accuracy and reliability of results.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/Acceptable:
• Specimen Collection: Random urine sample collected in a
clean, sterile container.
• Volume: Minimum of 30 mL of urine.
• Storage Condition: Specimen should be stored refrigerated at
2-8°C if not tested immediately. Specimen should be brought to
room temperature before analysis.
Unacceptable:
• Specimens collected in containers with preservatives.
• Specimens with debris or particulate that could obstruct
instrumentation.
• Specimens arriving in laboratory more than 72 hours after
collection without refrigeration.
• Specimens with insufficient volume for analysis.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)
system.
• Centrifuge.
• Vortex mixer.
• Pipettes and tips.
• Analytical balance.
Reagents:
• Primary standards for Delta-8 and Delta-9-THC.
• Internal standard (e.g., deuterated THC).
• Organic solvents (e.g., acetonitrile, methanol).
• Mobile phase solvents for LC-MS/MS (e.g., water, formic acid).

1. PRINCIPLE AND/OR PURPOSE
To provide reliable confirmation and quantification of Delta-8 and
Delta-9-THC metabolites in urine, which are indicative of cannabis
exposure. This confirmation ensures the accuracy of initial screening
results through LC-MS/MS analysis.
1. PROCEDURE
A) Sample Preparation and Pre-Analytical Steps:
1. Receiving and Accessioning:
◦ Confirm specimen identity and integrity.
◦ Assign a unique laboratory accession number.
◦ Log details in the laboratory information management
system (LIMS).
2. Sample Handling and Storage:
◦ Store specimens at 2-8°C until analysis.
◦ Ensure all samples are at room temperature before the
analytical process.
3. Aliquot Preparation:
◦ Vortex the urine sample to ensure homogeneity.
◦ Pipette a 5 mL aliquot of urine into a labeled centrifuge tube.
4. Internal Standard Addition:
◦ Add a known volume of internal standard to each aliquot
and vortex.
5. Centrifugation:
◦ Centrifuge the samples for 10 minutes at 4000 rpm.
◦ Transfer the supernatant to clean vials for extraction.
B) Extraction:
1. Solid-Phase Extraction (SPE):
◦ Condition SPE cartridges with organic solvent and water.
◦ Load the centrifuged supernatant onto the cartridge.
◦ Wash with appropriate wash solution (e.g., water with 0.1%
formic acid).
◦ Elute cannabinoids with a solvent (e.g., methanol).
2. Liquid-Liquid Extraction (optional method):
◦ Add organic solvent to urine aliquot.
◦ Vortex and centrifuge to separate organic and aqueous
layers.
◦ Collect the organic layer.
3. Evaporation:
◦ Evaporate the extract under a stream of nitrogen to dryness.
4. Reconstitution:
◦ Reconstitute the residue in an appropriate solvent (e.g.,
mobile phase).
C) LC-MS/MS Analysis:
1. Instrument Setup:
◦ Initialize the LC-MS/MS system according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Prepare and load mobile phases.
2. Calibration:
◦ Prepare a calibration curve using primary standards.
◦ Calibrate the system by running standards through the LC-
MS/MS.
3. QC Check:
◦ Run quality control samples (low, medium, high) to ensure
the system's functionality.
4. Sample Injection:
◦ Inject an appropriate volume of the reconstituted sample
into the LC-MS/MS.
◦ Use a gradient elution method, typically with a run time of
10-20 minutes depending on separation efficiency.
5. Data Acquisition:
◦ Acquire data using multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) for
Delta-8 and Delta-9-THC transitions.
6. Data Processing:
◦ Process chromatographic data to measure peak areas.
◦ Quantify Delta-8 and Delta-9-THC using calibration curves.
D) Post-Analytical Procedures:
1. Review Results:
◦ Verify that all specimens have valid control and calibration
data.
◦ Evaluate results for consistency and accuracy.
2. Reporting Results:
◦ Document results in the LIMS.
◦ Report results adhering to established cut-off values.
◦ Flag and review abnormal results or inconsistencies.
3. Sample Storage:
◦ Dispose of used specimens following biohazard disposal
guidelines.
◦ Retain aliquots of tested samples if storage for future
reference is required (store at -20°C).
1. QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE
2. Internal QC:
◦ Run quality control samples at the start and end of each
analytical batch.
◦ Ensure internal standards are within acceptance limits.
3. Proficiency Testing:
◦ Participate in external proficiency testing programs to
validate the accuracy and precision of the analytical
methods.
4. Documentation:
◦ Document all findings, calibration data, QC results, and
maintenance records.
◦ Ensure all SOP-adherence and deviations are noted.
