Analytical Phase Protocol for DELTA-9-CARBOXY-
TETRAHYDROCANNABINOL (THC-COOH)
CONFIRMATION AND CREATININE RATIO, RANDOM,
URINE
1. PURPOSE
To confirm the presence of Delta-9-Carboxy-Tetrahydrocannabinol
(THC-COOH) and determine the creatinine ratio in random urine
specimens, ensuring accurate and reliable results.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing and
documenting the analyses as outlined in this procedure.
• All staff must ensure quality control and address any deviations in
the process.
1. DEFINITION
Delta-9-Carboxy-Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC-COOH) is a metabolite
of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the primary psychoactive component
of cannabis. Creatinine is a breakdown product of creatine phosphate
in muscle, and its concentration in urine serves as a marker to
normalize drug metabolite levels.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/acceptable:
• 30 mL random urine sample collected in a clean, dry container.
Specimen must be centrifuged and aliquoted if necessary.
Unacceptable:
• Specimens containing large particles or debris.
• Specimens with visible signs of contamination (e.g., blood, fecal
matter).
• Specimens with no collection date/time or improperly labelled
containers.
• Specimens stored at inappropriate temperatures or exceeding
stability period.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) or Liquid
Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) for
THC-COOH confirmation
• Automated Chemistry Analyzer for creatinine measurement
• Calibrators and controls for both THC-COOH and creatinine
• Reagent kits and internal standards specific for THC-COOH and
creatinine
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Urine collection containers
• Vortex mixer
1. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Preparation:
1. Mix the urine specimen thoroughly by gentle inversion.
2. Centrifuge the sample at 1000-2000 g for 10 minutes to remove
particulate matter.
3. Aliquot a portion of the clear supernatant into clean labeled
tubes for analysis.
B. THC-COOH Confirmation:
1. Prepare calibrators, controls, and samples according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
2. Add internal standard to each calibrator, control, and sample.
3. Extract THC-COOH using an appropriate extraction method
(e.g., liquid-liquid extraction, solid-phase extraction).
4. Evaporate the extract to dryness under nitrogen and
reconstitute in the appropriate solvent.
5. Inject a specific volume into the GC-MS or LC-MS/MS system.
6. Perform the analysis according to the instrument’s operating
procedure.
7. Identify and quantify THC-COOH by comparing sample peak
areas to those of the calibrators.
8. Record results along with quality control data.
C. Creatinine Measurement:
1. Set up the automated chemistry analyzer as per the
manufacturer's guidelines.
2. Calibrate the instrument using a standard creatinine solution.
3. Analyze urine aliquots, calibrators, and controls according to
the instrument-specific protocol.
4. Calculate the creatinine concentration in mg/dL or mmol/L.
5. Record creatinine results along with quality control data.
D. Calculation and Reporting:
1. Calculate the THC-COOH/Creatinine ratio by dividing the
concentration of THC-COOH (ng/mL) by the creatinine
concentration (mg/dL). Example: Ratio (ng/mg) = THC-COOH
(ng/mL) / Creatinine (mg/dL)
2. Review the results for accuracy. Confirm that quality control
parameters are within acceptable limits.
3. Report the final results in the laboratory information system.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
• Utilize two quality control samples (low, high) for both THC-COOH
and creatinine assays with each batch.
• Document all quality control results. Investigate and resolve any
out-of-range results before proceeding.
• Perform maintenance and calibration of instruments according to
the manufacturer's schedule and guidelines.
1. REFERENCES
• Instrument and reagent manufacturer's guidelines.
• CLIA requirements for laboratory testing and documentation.
1. NOTES
• Follow safety guidelines and wear appropriate personal protective
equipment (PPE) when handling urine specimens and reagents.
• Ensure proper disposal of biological waste according to local
regulations.
By adhering to this protocol, laboratory staff will accurately and
reliably confirm THC-COOH presence and measure creatinine
concentrations in urine specimens, ensuring compliant and
dependable results.
