Standard Operating Procedure for DELTA-LIKE 3 PROTEIN
(SP347), SEMI-QUANTITATIVE IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY,
MANUAL, TISSUE
1. PURPOSE
This procedure describes the steps for performing and analyzing
DELTA-LIKE 3 PROTEIN (SP347) semi-quantitative
immunohistochemistry on tissue samples manually. The protocol
aims to ensure consistent, reliable, and accurate detection and
evaluation of DELTA-LIKE 3 PROTEIN in tissue specimens.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing the
manual immunohistochemistry procedures, analyzing the tissue
samples, documenting findings, and maintaining equipment and
reagents.
2. DEFINITION
Immunohistochemistry (IHC) is a method for detecting specific
antigens in tissue sections by using antibodies that bind to those
antigens. The analysis is semi-quantitative, meaning the expression
of DELTA-LIKE 3 PROTEIN is evaluated based on staining intensity
and distribution within the tissue.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Acceptable Specimen: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue
sections on positively charged glass slides.
• Unacceptable Specimen: Fresh, frozen, or inadequately fixed
tissue specimens.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Microscopy slides with tissue sections
• DELTA-LIKE 3 PROTEIN (SP347) primary antibody
• Secondary antibody (HRP-conjugated)
• Detection system reagents (e.g., DAB chromogen, substrate
buffer)
• Hematoxylin counterstain
• PBS buffer
• Xylene
• Ethanol (graded series)
• Cover glass and mounting medium
• Humidified chamber
• Light microscope
• Timer
5. PROCEDURE
1. Deparaffinization and Rehydration
◦ Place the tissue slides in xylene for 2 minutes, two changes.
◦ Transfer the slides through a series of graded ethanol
(100%, 95%, 70%) for 2 minutes each.
◦ Rinse the slides in distilled water for 2 minutes.
2. Antigen Retrieval
◦ Heat-mediated antigen retrieval: Immerse slides in citric acid
buffer (pH 6.0) and heat in a microwave or pressure cooker
for 20 minutes.
◦ Allow the slides to cool to room temperature for 20 minutes.
◦ Rinse the slides gently in PBS.
3. Blocking Endogenous Peroxidase Activity
◦ Incubate slides in 3% hydrogen peroxide solution for 10
minutes.
◦ Rinse the slides in PBS for 5 minutes.
4. Blocking Non-specific Binding Sites
◦ Incubate the slides in blocking buffer for 10 minutes at room
temperature.
◦ Drain excess blocking buffer.
5. Primary Antibody Incubation
◦ Incubate slides with DELTA-LIKE 3 PROTEIN (SP347)
primary antibody diluted as per the manufacturer's
instructions for 1 hour at room temperature in a humidified
chamber.
◦ Rinse the slides in PBS three times for 5 minutes each.
6. Secondary Antibody Incubation
◦ Incubate slides with HRP-conjugated secondary antibody for
30 minutes at room temperature in a humidified chamber.
◦ Rinse the slides in PBS three times for 5 minutes each.
7. Chromogen Development
◦ Apply DAB chromogen solution to the slides and incubate
for 5–10 minutes, checking under the microscope for the
desired staining intensity.
◦ Rinse the slides in PBS for 5 minutes.
8. Counterstaining
◦ Immerse the slides in hematoxylin for 1 minute for
counterstaining.
◦ Rinse the slides in running tap water for 5 minutes.
9. Dehydration and Mounting
◦ Dehydrate the slides through graded ethanol (70%, 95%,
100%) for 2 minutes each.
◦ Clear the slides in xylene for 2 minutes, two changes.
◦ Mount the slides using a suitable mounting medium and
cover glass.
10. Microscopic Evaluation
◦ Examine the slides under a light microscope.
◦ Evaluate the staining intensity and distribution of DELTA-
LIKE 3 PROTEIN and compare it with control sections.
◦ Document the staining results as negative, weak, moderate,
or strong based on standardized criteria.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include positive and negative control slides with each run.
• Validate all new antibody lots and reagents before use.
• Record all results and observations, including any deviations, in a
laboratory log.
• Maintain proper calibration and service records for all equipment
used in the procedure.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
• Document findings according to site-specific reporting guidelines.
• Report the semi-quantitative results of DELTA-LIKE 3 PROTEIN
staining, including the percentage of positive cells and the
intensity of staining (negative, weak, moderate, or strong).

9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Staining artifacts can result from improper technique or
compromised reagents.
• The semi-quantitative assessment is subject to inter-observer
variability; standardized criteria and training can minimize this.
