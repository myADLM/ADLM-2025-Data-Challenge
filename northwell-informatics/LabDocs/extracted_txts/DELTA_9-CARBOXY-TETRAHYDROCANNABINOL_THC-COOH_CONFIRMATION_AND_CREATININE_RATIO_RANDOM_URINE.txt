Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for DELTA 9-CARBOXY-
TETRAHYDROCANNABINOL (THC-COOH) CONFIRMATION AND
CREATININE RATIO, RANDOM, URINE
1. PURPOSE
This SOP provides a detailed protocol for the analytical phase of
DELTA 9-CARBOXY-TETRAHYDROCANNABINOL (THC-COOH)
confirmation and creatinine ratio determination in random urine
samples. This procedure ensures accurate and reliable results.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing the
analysis as described in this SOP. It is the responsibility of the
laboratory supervisor to oversee the process and ensure compliance
with the procedure, resolving any issues that may arise.
1. DEFINITIONS
THC-COOH: A primary metabolite of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol
(THC), the psychoactive component of cannabis, detectable in urine.
Creatinine: A waste product generated from muscle metabolism and
excreted in urine, used as a normalization factor for assessing urine
dilution/concentration.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Preferred/Acceptable:
• Collect a random urine sample (minimum of 30 mL) in a clean,
sterile container.
• Store the sample refrigerated (2-8°C) if not analyzed immediately.
• Samples are stable for up to 7 days when refrigerated. Avoid
freezing.
Unacceptable:
• Samples with visible contamination or insufficient volume.
• Samples stored at room temperature for over 24 hours before
analysis.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Gas Chromatograph-Mass Spectrometer (GC-MS) or Liquid
Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)
• Analytical balance
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes and disposable tips
• Vortex mixer
Reagents:
• THC-COOH reference standards
• Creatinine reagents
• Internal standards
• Mobile phase solvents and buffers
• Calibration curve standard solutions
Supplies:
• Urine collection containers
• Disposable gloves
• Centrifuge tubes
• HPLC vials
1. PROCEDURE
A) SAMPLE PREPARATION
1. Remove urine sample from the refrigerator and allow it to reach
room temperature.
2. Vortex the sample for approximately 1 minute to ensure
homogeneity.
3. Pipette 5 mL of the urine sample into a labeled centrifuge tube.
4. Add internal standard to the sample.
5. Centrifuge the sample at 2000-3000 rpm for 10 minutes to
remove particulate matter.
6. Transfer the supernatant to a clean HPLC vial for analysis.
B) THC-COOH CONFIRMATION
1. Inject appropriate sample volume (usually 1-2 µL) into the GC-
MS or LC-MS/MS.
2. Set the instrument parameters as follows:
◦ Column: Capillary column suitable for THC-COOH
separation
◦ Injection temperature: Typically 250°C
◦ Carrier gas: Helium for GC, nitrogen for LC
◦ Flow rate: 1.0 mL/min
◦ Detector settings: Automatic adjustments based on
manufacturer's instructions
3. Create a calibration curve using THC-COOH standards at
known concentrations.
4. Run quality control samples alongside unknowns to ensure
analytical accuracy.
5. Identify THC-COOH peaks based on retention time and mass
spectral data.
6. Quantify the THC-COOH concentration by comparing sample
peak areas to the calibration curve.
C) CREATININE ASSAY
1. Pipette an aliquot of the urine sample (typically 1 mL) into a
separate reaction vessel.
2. Add the creatinine reagent according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
3. Mix and incubate the reaction mixture at room temperature for
the time specified in the reagent instructions.
4. Measure the absorbance or fluorescence using a suitable
spectrophotometer.
5. Calculate the creatinine concentration using a calibration curve.
D) RESULTS CALCULATION AND INTERPRETATION
1. Divide the detected concentration of THC-COOH (ng/mL) by
the creatinine concentration (mg/dL) to obtain the THC-COOH
to creatinine ratio.
2. Use established reference ranges to interpret the results.
3. Report the results to the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
and verify by a qualified technologist.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
5. Run at least two levels of THC-COOH and creatinine quality
control samples: one at the low end and one at the high end of
the assay’s linear range.
6. Document the QC results including any corrective actions taken
if results fall outside acceptable range.
7. Ensure all equipment and materials are calibrated and validated
regularly according to external and internal standards.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
9. Enter results into LIS once validated.
10. Flag any results that require immediate clinical attention.
11. Maintain confidentiality and ensure results are delivered to
authorized personnel only.
