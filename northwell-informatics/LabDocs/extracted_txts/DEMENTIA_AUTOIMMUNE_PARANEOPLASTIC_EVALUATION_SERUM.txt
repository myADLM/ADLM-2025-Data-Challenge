SOP for Analytical Phase of Generating Results for Dementia,
Autoimmune/Paraneoplastic Evaluation, Serum
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedure for generating
results for dementia, autoimmune/paraneoplastic evaluations using
serum samples in the laboratory. This procedure ensures accurate
and reliable results, consistent with quality control and regulatory
standards.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of all laboratory staff to adhere to the
procedures outlined in this document. Supervisors must ensure that
all personnel are trained and compliant with these procedures.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen Type: Serum Specimen Volume: Minimum of 2 mL serum
Collection Tubes: Serum separator tube (SST), red-top tube without
anticoagulant Specimen Stability: - Room Temperature (15-25°C): Up
to 24 hours - Refrigerated (2-8°C): Up to 72 hours - Frozen (-20°C or
lower): Up to 6 months Unacceptable Specimens: - Hemolyzed,
lipemic, or icteric samples - Specimens collected in anticoagulant
tubes
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Centrifuge • Pipettes and tips • Vortex mixer • Serum
separator tubes (SST) or red-top tubes • Refrigerated storage •
Automated immunoassay analyzer (with appropriate software) •
Reagents specific for dementia and autoimmune/paraneoplastic
panels (store and handle according to manufacturer
instructions) • Calibration and control materials
2. PROCEDURE
A) Sample Preparation:
1. Upon receipt, visually inspect the specimen for acceptability (no
hemolysis, lipemia, or icterus).
2. Centrifuge the blood sample at 3000 g for 10 minutes to
separate serum.
3. Transfer serum aliquot using a pipette to a new, clean tube.
4. If not immediately analyzed, store serum at 2-8°C or freeze at
-20°C or lower.
B) Assay Procedure:
1. Allow frozen serum samples to thaw completely at room
temperature. Mix well using a vortex mixer.
2. Load samples, controls, and calibrators onto the automated
immunoassay analyzer.
3. Program the analyzer for the specific dementia and
autoimmune/paraneoplastic panels. Ensure the correct settings
and parameters are selected according to the assay protocol.
4. Run the assay according to manufacturer's instructions.
C) Quality Control:
1. Run quality control materials (at least one negative and one
positive control) with each batch of patient samples.
2. Verify that control results fall within the acceptable range before
proceeding with patient sample analysis.
3. If controls do not meet criteria, identify and correct the issue
before reanalyzing patient samples.
D) Result Interpretation and Reporting:
1. Review the raw data and quality control results. Ensure analyte
concentrations are accurately recorded.
2. Calculate final results using the automated system.
3. Verify results, noting any flags or errors indicated by the
analyzer.
4. Document results in the laboratory information system (LIS).
E) Sample Integrity:
1. Ensure that samples have undergone no alterations or
mishandling.
2. Avoid samples with prolonged storage times and those exposed
to improper temperatures.
