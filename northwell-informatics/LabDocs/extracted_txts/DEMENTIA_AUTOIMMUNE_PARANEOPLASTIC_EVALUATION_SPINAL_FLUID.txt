Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Dementia, Autoimmune/Paraneoplastic
Evaluation, Spinal Fluid
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedures for the analytical
phase of generating results for Dementia, Autoimmune/
Paraneoplastic Evaluation, and Spinal Fluid testing. This ensures
accurate, reliable and timely reporting of patient results.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of designated staff to carry out the procedures
as defined and document all necessary information accurately. It is
the responsibility of all staff to identify any deficiencies or issues
arising during the analytical process and report them to the
designated supervisor promptly. It is the responsibility of supervisors
to ensure that procedures are followed meticulously and any
corrective actions required are promptly implemented.
1. DEFINITIONS
• Dementia Evaluation: Includes testing to help diagnose the
underlying causes of dementia.
• Autoimmune/Paraneoplastic Evaluation: Includes testing for
detecting biomarkers associated with autoimmune diseases and
paraneoplastic syndromes.
• Spinal Fluid (CSF) Testing: Includes analysis of cerebrospinal
fluid (CSF) to detect infection, inflammation, autoimmune
disorders, and malignancies.
1. REAGENTS AND EQUIPMENT
• Automated analyzers, as specified for the tests.
• Reagents and supplies, including but not limited to ELISA kits,
LightCycler®, and relevant assay kits.
• Controlled temperature incubators, refrigeration units, and
centrifuges.
• Data management systems for result documentation and
verification.
1. PROCEDURE
A) Sample Preparation
1. Spinal fluid samples should be received in sterile containers
and processed as per recommended guidelines.
2. All samples must be pre-centrifuged if necessary, and the
supernatant transferred to appropriate assay tubes.
3. Ensure specimens are processed promptly to maintain stability.
B) Testing Methods
1. For Dementia Evaluation:
◦ Utilize ELISA kits for detection of specific protein markers
(e.g., amyloid beta, tau proteins). Follow manufacturer's
instructions for assay preparation and processing.
◦ Running automated analysis on designated platforms,
ensuring all controls are within target ranges.
2. For Autoimmune/Paraneoplastic Evaluation:
◦ Employ assays such as antibody detection panels. Follow
reagent preparation and handling as per manufacturer’s
protocol.
◦ Run the assays on automated systems ensuring the
samples and reagents meet specified conditions.
3. For Spinal Fluid Testing:
◦ Include tests for infectious agents presumed etiologies,
inflammation markers including IgG index or oligoclonal
bands.
◦ Using both manual and automated techniques as required
per test protocols.
C) Validation and Quality Control
1. Regularly perform quality control checks using predefined
control samples to validate the accuracy of test runs.
2. Document all quality control activities in the QA log, and make
sure any deviations are promptly investigated and resolved.
D) Result Recording and Verification
1. Record all results accurately in the Laboratory Information
System (LIS). Verify the results based on the established
validation criteria before reporting them.
2. Any anomalous results or results beyond reference ranges
need a critical review and confirmation, including running repeat
tests if necessary.
E) Troubleshooting
1. In case of instrument fault or assay deviation, consult the
technical troubleshooting guide or reach out to the designated
technical support team.
2. Document any troubleshooting steps taken and additional
verification re-runs.
3. REPORTING RESULTS
4. Ensure results are entered into the LIS promptly and accurately.
5. Verify and validate results before final reporting to ensure they
meet the established clinical and laboratory standards.
6. For critical findings, follow department guidelines on urgent
reporting and notification procedures.
7. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Follow established reference intervals for each analyte as defined in
the kit inserts and validated by the laboratory.

• Manufacturer’s inserts for various assay kits.
• Internal laboratory quality assurance protocols.
• Guidelines provided in the Clinical and Laboratory Standards
Institute (CLSI) documentation.
This SOP must be reviewed periodically and updated to incorporate
any new methodologies or revisions in accordance with latest clinical
guidelines and regulatory standards.
