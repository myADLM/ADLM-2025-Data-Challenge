Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase of Generating Results for Demyelinating
Neuropathy Antibody Panel
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this SOP is to provide a standardized
method for the analysis, quality control, reporting, and documentation
of the Demyelinating Neuropathy Antibody Panel in order to ensure
accurate and reliable results.
Responsibility:
• It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory personnel to
perform the assay following this procedure.
• It is the responsibility of the laboratory supervisor to ensure
compliance, review assay results, and address any issues that
arise during the analytical process.
2. DEFINITIONS
Demyelinating Neuropathy Antibody Panel: Includes testing for
antibodies commonly associated with demyelinating neuropathies.
Typically, this includes Myelin Protein Zero (P0), Myelin Associated
Glycoprotein (MAG), Myelin Basic Protein (MBP), and other relevant
antibodies.
3. PROCEDURE
3.1 Preparation
• Ensure the specimen has been properly collected and
accessioned. This panel typically requires serum or plasma
samples.
• Prepare the work area and ensure all reagents, consumables,
and instrumentation required for the assay are available.
3.2 Materials Required
• ELISA kits or other immunoassay kits for each antibody in the
panel (follow the manufacturer's instructions).
• Microplate reader compatible with the assay kits.
• Calibrated pipettes and tips.
• Reagent reservoirs.
• Plate washer (automated or manual).
• Deionized water.
• Timer.
• Laboratory coat, gloves, and other appropriate personal protective
equipment (PPE).
3.3 Sample Processing and Assay Setup
• Bring all reagents and samples to room temperature before
starting the assay.
• Centrifuge serum/plasma samples if needed to remove particulate
matter.
• Label microplates and tubes accordingly to prevent any mix-ups.
• Prepare reagent blanks, calibrators, and controls as instructed in
the kit inserts.
• Dilute patient samples as per the assay kit instructions.
• Pipette appropriate volumes of calibrators, controls, and patient
samples into the designated wells of the microplate.
3.4 Assay Execution
• Follow the assay kit protocol carefully for the incubation, washing,
and reagent addition steps:
◦ Add the capture antibodies.
◦ Incubate plates as per manufacturer’s recommended time and
temperature.
◦ Wash plates thoroughly to remove unbound reagents.
◦ Add secondary antibody or enzyme conjugate.
◦ Incubate again as per specified conditions.
◦ Perform final washing steps.
◦ Add substrate solution and incubate.
◦ Stop the reaction by adding the stop solution or by other
means specified in the kit.
3.5 Reading and Interpretation
• Read the optical density (OD) at the specified wavelength using a
microplate reader.
• Compare the OD readings of the calibrators and controls to the
pre-established reference values provided in the assay kit.
• Calculate the patient sample concentrations using the standard
curve generated from the calibrators.
3.6 Quality Control
• Run both positive and negative controls with every batch of
samples analyzed.
• Any deviation of control values from the expected range must be
investigated, and the assay repeated as necessary.
• Document all QC results and any corrective actions taken.
3.7 Reporting Results
• Transcribe the patient’s antibody concentrations into the
Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Ensure that all critical and out-of-range results are flagged and
verified.
• Generate and review the final report for accuracy and
completeness.
• Deliver the completed report to the ordering clinician.
3.8 Documentation
• Complete all necessary entries in the laboratory's assay log,
including sample IDs, dates, time of assay, initials of the
technologist, and any deviations from protocol.
• Retain all raw data and any notes or logs related to the assay for
future reference and accreditation purposes.
4. QUALITY ASSURANCE
• Regularly check the calibration and maintenance status of all
equipment involved in the assay.
• Follow the laboratory’s internal and external quality control and
assurance procedures.
• Participate in proficiency testing programs for the Demyelinating
Neuropathy Antibody Panel to ensure continuous accuracy and
reliability of test results.
