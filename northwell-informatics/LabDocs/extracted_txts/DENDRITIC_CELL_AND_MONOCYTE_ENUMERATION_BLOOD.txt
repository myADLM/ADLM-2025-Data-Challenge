Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Dendritic Cell and
Monocyte Enumeration, Blood
1. PURPOSE
This SOP aims to outline the procedure for the enumeration of
dendritic cells (DCs) and monocytes in peripheral blood using flow
cytometry. Accurate enumeration of these cells is critical for research
and clinical studies that investigate immune responses, disease
progression, and therapeutic evaluations.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for
performing the procedure as outlined. It is the responsibility of all
laboratory staff to report any issues or discrepancies to the
supervisor immediately.
1. DEFINITION
For this SOP, dendritic cells are defined as peripheral blood cells
expressing HLA-DR and lacking lineage-specific markers (such as
CD3, CD14, CD19, CD20). Monocytes are characterized as cells
expressing CD14. The procedure will employ flow cytometry to
identify and enumerate these cells based on their unique marker
expressions.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Requirements: - Type: Fresh peripheral blood - Volume:
3-5 mL of EDTA-anticoagulated blood - Stability: Process specimen
within 24 hours of collection; store at 4°C if not processed
immediately
B. Reagents and Supplies: - EDTA tubes (purple top) - Flow
cytometry buffer (PBS with 0.5% BSA and 0.1% sodium azide) -
Fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies: * anti-HLA-DR (APC) * anti-
CD11c (PE-Cy7) * anti-CD14 (FITC) * anti-CD3, CD19, CD20
(PerCP-Cy5.5) - Red blood cell lysis buffer - BD Accuri C6 Plus Flow
Cytometer or equivalent - Calibration beads - Sheath fluid
C. Equipment Calibration and Quality Control - Perform daily startup
and calibration of the flow cytometer as per manufacturer’s
instructions. - Run three levels of quality control materials to ensure
the accurate calibration of the flow cytometer. - Document all
calibrations and QC results in the instrument log.
D. Sample Preparation: 1. Mix the EDTA blood sample by inverting
the tube gently for 10 times. 2. Aliquot 100 µL of whole blood into a
polystyrene tube. 3. Add the predefined volumes of conjugated
antibodies: - 20 µL of anti-HLA-DR (APC) - 5 µL of anti-CD11c (PE-
Cy7) - 5 µL of anti-CD14 (FITC) - 5 µL of anti-CD3, CD19, CD20
(PerCP-Cy5.5) 4. Vortex the tube gently. 5. Incubate the sample in
the dark at room temperature for 30 minutes. 6. Add 2 mL of red
blood cell lysis buffer to the tube, mix well, and incubate for 10
minutes. 7. Centrifuge the tubes at 300 x g for 5 minutes. Decant the
supernatant. 8. Wash the cell pellet with 2 mL of flow cytometry
buffer. Centrifuge again and decant the supernatant. 9. Resuspend
the cell pellet in 0.5 mL of flow cytometry buffer.
E. Flow Cytometry Acquisition and Analysis: 1. Load the resuspended
sample into the flow cytometer. 2. Set up the flow cytometer
according to the manufacturer’s instructions (see flow cytometer
manual for details). 3. Run samples and acquire data, collecting a
minimum of 50,000 events. 4. Use the relevant software (e.g., BD
Accuri C6 Plus software) to set analysis gates: - Identify DCs by
gating on HLA-DR positive, lineage-negative (CD3, CD19, CD20
negative). - Enumerate myeloid dendritic cells (mDCs) as CD11c+
HLA-DR+. - Enumerate plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) as
CD11c- HLA-DR+. - Enumerate monocytes as CD14+.
F. Reporting Results: 1. Export the analyzed data and tabulate the
percentages and absolute counts of mDCs, pDCs, and monocytes. 2.
Calculate the absolute count using the white blood cell count from the
complete blood count (CBC). 3. Record the results and review the
data for consistency and accuracy. 4. Enter the results into the
Laboratory Information System (LIS) and validate all data.
G. Cross-Referencing and Troubleshooting: - If results appear
inconsistent or fall outside of control limits, re-run the quality control
and re-calibrate the instrument if necessary. - Verify sample integrity
and processing accuracy before reporting questionable results. -
Notify a supervisor and document any deviations from standards.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS:
◦ Reference intervals for mDCs, pDCs, and monocytes may
vary based on the population studied and should be
established based on laboratory-specific data and literature
reviews.

Guidelines
This SOP must be reviewed and updated at a minimum on an annual
basis or as required by procedural or technological changes,
ensuring continuous improvement and compliance with CLIA
standards.
