STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP)
DENGUE VIRUS ANTIBODY/ANTIGEN PANEL, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the analytical phase of
generating results for Dengue Virus Antibody/Antigen Panel in serum
specimens.
Responsibility:
Designated staff are responsible for performing assays, managing
quality control, and documenting results. Staff and supervisors are
responsible for ensuring adherence to the SOP, troubleshooting, and
corrective actions.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS:
Preferred/acceptable:
• 3-5 mL of blood collected in a serum separator tube (SST) or red-
top tube.
Unacceptable:
• Specimens with severe hemolysis, lipemia, or icterus.
• Specimens collected in anticoagulant tubes (e.g., EDTA, heparin,
citrate).
• Specimens arriving in the laboratory greater than 48 hours after
collection.
• Specimens without proper labeling or requisition details.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES:
• Centrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Micropipettes with sterile tips
• ELISA plate washer
• ELISA reader
• Dengue Panel ELISA kit (including reagents for Dengue IgM, IgG,
and NS1 antigen detection)
• Timer
• Temperature-dependent storage units
• PPE (personal protective equipment)
• Clean laboratory bench
1. PROCEDURE:
A. Specimen Processing:
1. Upon receipt of the specimen, verify patient information,
collection date, time, and appearance of the sample.
2. Centrifuge the serum separator tube at 1500-2000 x g for 10
minutes.
3. Carefully aliquot the serum into a labeled secondary tube
without disturbing the cell layer.
4. Store serum samples at 2-8°C if not immediately tested. For
long-term storage, freeze at -20°C or below.
B. ELISA Assay for Dengue Virus Antibody/Antigen Panel:
1. Prepare reagents and samples as per the manufacturer’s
instructions included in the Dengue ELISA kit.
2. Set up the ELISA plate according to the layout provided in the
kit instructions, including positive and negative controls,
standards, and patient samples.
3. Add appropriate volumes of serum samples and reagent
components to the wells as specified in the kit insert.
4. Seal and incubate the plate at the prescribed temperature (e.g.,
room temperature or 37°C), for the recommended duration.
5. Wash the plate using the ELISA plate washer to remove
unbound materials.
6. Add the substrate solution to the wells and incubate based on
the kit specifications.
7. Stop the reaction using the appropriate stop solution when the
incubation is complete.
8. Measure the optical density (OD) of each well using the ELISA
reader at the specified wavelength (e.g., 450 nm).
C. Calculation and Interpretation of Results:
1. Calculate the average OD values for duplicate wells of
standards, controls, and patient samples.
2. Generate a standard curve from the OD values of the standards
using the analytical software.
3. Determine the concentration of Dengue IgM, IgG, and NS1
antigen in patient samples based on the standard curve.
4. Compare the calculated concentrations to reference intervals
provided in the kit instructions to interpret results:
◦ IgM/IgG and NS1 Antigen Positive: indicates recent or active
infection.
◦ IgM/IgG and NS1 Antigen Negative: indicates no evidence
of recent or active infection.
D. Quality Control:
1. Run positive and negative controls in each assay batch to
ensure the validity of results.
2. Record controls and patient results in the laboratory information
management system (LIMS).
3. If controls fall outside the acceptable range, do not report
patient results; troubleshoot as necessary and repeat the assay.
E. Troubleshooting:
1. If any reagents or equipment malfunction, refer to the
manufacturer’s troubleshooting guide.
2. Notify the supervisor and report equipment issues to the
appropriate personnel for repairs/servicing.
3. Repeat the assay with fresh reagents and/or properly
functioning equipment.
4. REPORTING RESULTS:
5. Review and verify raw data against QC standards before
reporting.
6. Report results directly to the LIMS and notify requesting
physicians/clinicians according to site-specific guidelines.
7. Document any comments or notes regarding sample integrity,
assay performance, or deviations.
8. REFERENCES:
• Manufacturer kit inserts for Dengue Virus IgM/IgG and NS1
ELISA.
• Laboratory-specific reporting guidelines and quality control
procedures.
1. REVISION HISTORY:
Document any revisions and updates to the SOP, including the date
of amendment and the nature of the changes.
