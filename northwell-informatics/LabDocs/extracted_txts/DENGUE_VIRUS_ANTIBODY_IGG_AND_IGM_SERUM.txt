Standard Operating Procedures (SOP): DENGUE VIRUS
ANTIBODY, IGG AND IGM, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedure for the detection
of IgG and IgM antibodies specific to the Dengue Virus in patient
serum samples using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
Responsibility: It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory
personnel to perform the assay as described in this protocol, ensure
accurate data recording, and report results promptly.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
◦ Microplate reader (ELISA reader) capable of reading
between 450nm and 630nm
◦ Microplate washer
◦ Micropipettes (various volumes, 10-1000uL) and tips
◦ Incubator set at 37°C
◦ Vortex mixer
Reagents:
• Dengue virus IgG and IgM ELISA kits (store as instructed by the
manufacturer)
• Diluent
• Wash buffer
• Substrate solution
• Stop solution
• Positive control serum
• Negative control serum
Supplies:
• ELISA microplates
• 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes
• Absorbent paper
• Disposable gloves and lab coat
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STORAGE
Specimen Type:
• 5 mL of serum collected in a red-top or SST (serum separator
tube).
Specimen Storage:
• Refrigerate serum samples at 2-8°C if the test is to be conducted
within 48 hours. For longer storage, freeze at -20°C or lower.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or microbially contaminated samples.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation:
• Ensure all reagents and specimens are brought to room
temperature (18-25°C) before starting.
• Prepare wash buffer as indicated in the ELISA kit instructions.
• Set up the microplate reader and washer as per manufacturer
specifications.
B. Assay Procedure:
1. Control and Sample Preparation:
◦ Label microplate wells for controls and patient samples.
◦ Dispense 100 µL of controls (positive and negative) into the
designated wells.
◦ Dispense 100 µL of patient serum samples into the
designated wells.
2. Primary Incubation:
◦ Incubate the plate at 37°C for 1 hour.
- Wash the wells three times with 300 µL of wash buffer, ensuring complete removal after each wash.
1. Conjugate Addition:
◦ Add 100 µL of IgG or IgM conjugate to each well.
◦ Incubate the plate at 37°C for 30 minutes.
◦ Wash the wells five times with 300 µL of wash buffer.
2. Substrate Addition:
◦ Add 100 µL of substrate solution to each well.
◦ Incubate the plate at room temperature for 15 minutes in the
dark.
3. Stop Reaction:
◦ Add 100 µL of stop solution to each well to stop the
enzymatic reaction.
4. Reading the Plate:
◦ Read the absorbance at 450 nm with a reference filter set at
630 nm using the ELISA reader.
◦ Ensure all results are documented.
5. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
• Calculate the mean absorbance for each set of duplicate controls
and patient specimens.
• Compare the optical density (OD) of the patient specimen to
those of the controls:
◦ Positive Control: Properly colored well with OD values within
the acceptable range specified by the kit.
◦ Negative Control: Should not show significant color
development; OD values should fall within the acceptable
range.
• Determine the cutoff value as per the ELISA kit’s instructions.
Result Interpretation:
• IgG/IgM positive: Patient sample OD is above cutoff value.
• IgG/IgM negative: Patient sample OD is below cutoff value.
• Equivocal: Retesting or further diagnostic evaluation may be
necessary.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run both positive and negative controls with each assay batch to
ensure reliability of results.
• If control results do not fall within the specified ranges:
◦ Recalibrate the equipment.
◦ Troubleshoot the procedure.
◦ Reassay the patient samples only after the control issues are
resolved.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Document the results in the laboratory information system (LIS).
• Ensure accurate conversion of absorbance values to qualitative
results aligning with the manufacturer's specifications.
• Report findings as Negative, Positive, or Equivocal for IgG and/or
IgM antibodies.
