1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the protocol for the molecular
detection of Dengue virus in serum using PCR (Polymerase Chain
Reaction) procedures in the laboratory during the analytical phase.
Adherence to this protocol ensures accuracy, reliability, and
reproducibility of results.
Responsibility:
All laboratory staff performing the Dengue virus PCR assay must be
trained and proficient in the methodology. It is the responsibility of the
staff to follow this SOP accurately and to maintain the integrity of the
specimens and reagents. Supervisors are responsible for overseeing
the adherence to this protocol, addressing any technical issues, and
ensuring that corrective actions are taken when necessary.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/acceptable:
• Serum collected in a standard SST (serum separator tube) or red-
top tube.
• Minimum volume required: 1 mL of serum.
• Serum should be separated from cells as soon as possible,
preferably within 2 hours of collection.
Unacceptable:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
• Specimens with visible particulate matter.
• Serum that has been stored at room temperature for more than
24 hours.
• Serum collected in tubes with anticoagulants (e.g., EDTA,
heparin).
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Real-time PCR instrument
• DNA extraction kit (validated for Dengue virus extraction)
• Dengue virus specific primers and probes
• Nuclease-free water
• PCR reagents: Taq polymerase, dNTPs, reaction buffer, MgCl2
• Positive and negative control materials
1. PROCEDURE
A) GENERATION OF RESULTS
1. Specimen Processing:
◦ Centrifuge the collected serum at 1400-1700 g for 10-15
minutes.
◦ Carefully transfer the serum to a new sterile tube without
disturbing the cell pellet.
◦ Store serum aliquots at -80°C if not immediately processed.
2. Nucleic Acid Extraction:
◦ Perform nucleic acid extraction using the validated DNA
extraction kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Include extraction controls (negative and positive) in each
extraction batch.
◦ Ensure that eluted nucleic acid is stored on ice until PCR
setup.
3. Preparation of PCR Master Mix:
◦ Prepare the PCR master mix by combining the following
components:
▪ Reaction Buffer
▪ dNTPs
▪ MgCl2
▪ Primers and Probes specific to Dengue virus
▪ Taq polymerase
▪ Nuclease-free water
◦ Prepare sufficient volume for all reactions, including
samples, controls, and replicates.
◦ Aliquot the master mix into individual PCR tubes or wells in
a 96-well plate.
4. Template Addition:
◦ Add extracted nucleic acid from the samples, positive
control, and negative control to the PCR tubes or wells
containing the master mix.
◦ Seal the tubes or plate to prevent contamination.
5. PCR Amplification:
◦ Program the real-time PCR instrument with the following
cycling conditions:
▪ Initial Denaturation: 95°C for 10 minutes
▪ Amplification (40 cycles):
▪ Denaturation: 95°C for 15 seconds
▪ Annealing/Extension: 60°C for 1 minute
◦ Include melt curve analysis if relevant to verify product
specificity.
6. Data Analysis:
◦ Monitor the amplification plot and Ct values for each sample
and control during the PCR run.
◦ Ensure that the negative control shows no amplification and
the positive control demonstrates the expected amplification
curve.
◦ Any sample with a Ct value within the established positive
range for Dengue virus is considered positive.
B) REPORTING RESULTS
1. Result Interpretation:
◦ Positive: Detectable Ct value within the established positive
range.
◦ Negative: No Ct value or Ct value above the established
negative range.
◦ Inconclusive: Ct value near the cut-off or amplification in the
negative control; repeat the test or request a new specimen.
2. Documentation:
◦ Record all results, including sample identification, Ct values,
and interpretation in the laboratory information system (LIS).
◦ Ensure all controls and sample results are reviewed and
validated by the technologist.
◦ Report results in compliance with site-specific reporting
guidelines.
3. Communication of Critical Results:
◦ Communicate critical results promptly to the responsible
clinician or healthcare provider.
◦ Document the communication of critical results according to
laboratory policy.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run positive and negative controls with each batch of specimens
to ensure assay validity.
• Perform regular proficiency testing and participate in external
quality assurance programs.
• Maintain a log of QC results and take corrective action if QC
results fall outside of acceptable limits.
• Review and update the SOP periodically or as needed based on
technological advancements or regulatory requirements.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Positive: Detectable Dengue virus RNA
• Negative: No detectable Dengue virus RNA
