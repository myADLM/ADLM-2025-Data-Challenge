STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP): DENGUE VIRUS,
MOLECULAR DETECTION, PCR, SPINAL FLUID
1. PURPOSE
To outline procedures for the molecular detection of Dengue Virus in
spinal fluid using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques,
ensuring accurate and timely results.
Responsibility:
• Qualified laboratory personnel are responsible for following this
protocol to ensure accurate detection of Dengue Virus in spinal
fluid specimens.
• The laboratory supervisor shall ensure compliance with the SOP
and address any issues that arise during testing.
2. PRINCIPLE
This procedure utilizes reverse transcription polymerase chain
reaction (RT-PCR) for the qualitative detection of Dengue Virus RNA
in spinal fluid. RT-PCR allows for the detection of viral RNA by
amplifying specific genetic sequences.
3. MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT
• Real-time PCR instrument
• PCR Workstation
• Microcentrifuge
• Pipettes and sterile, aerosol-resistant tips
• Nuclease-free water
• RNase-free tubes and supplies
• Thermal cycler
• Vortex mixer
• Biosafety cabinet
Reagents:
• Dengue Virus RT-PCR Master Mix Kit
• Internal control RNA (where applicable)
• Positive control RNA
• Negative control (nuclease-free water)
• Standard extraction kits for RNA isolation (commercial kit or
validated in-house method)
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Acceptable Specimen Types:
• Spinal fluid (cerebrospinal fluid, CSF)
Specimen Collection and Storage:
• Spinal fluid should be collected aseptically in a sterile container.
• Store specimens at 2-8°C for short-term storage (up to 24 hours).
For long-term storage, specimens should be frozen at -70°C or
below.
• Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
5. PROCEDURE
A) RNA Extraction:
1. Specimen Preparation:
◦ Thaw the frozen CSF specimen on ice (if applicable).
◦ Mix the specimen by gentle inversion.
2. RNA Isolation:
◦ Use a commercially available RNA extraction kit or a
validated in-house method.
◦ Follow the manufacturer's instructions for RNA isolation from
CSF.
◦ Include an extraction control (negative control) to monitor for
contamination during the extraction process.
◦ Elute RNA in an appropriate volume of nuclease-free water
or elution buffer provided with the extraction kit.
B) Real-Time RT-PCR Setup:
1. Master Mix Preparation:
◦ Prepare the RT-PCR Master Mix according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
◦ Include components such as primers, probes, enzymes, and
dNTPs as specified.
◦ Aliquot the prepared Master Mix into individual reaction
tubes or a PCR plate.
2. Addition of RNA:
◦ In each reaction tube, add a specified volume (e.g., 5 µL) of
the isolated RNA sample.
◦ Include appropriate negative controls (nuclease-free water)
and positive controls (Dengue Virus RNA).
3. Thermal Cycler Setup:
◦ Program the real-time PCR instrument as per the
manufacturer's instructions, typically including steps for
reverse transcription, initial denaturation, and PCR
amplification cycles.
◦ Example thermal cycling conditions:
▪ Reverse Transcription: 50°C for 15 minutes
▪ Initial Denaturation: 95°C for 2 minutes
▪ PCR Amplification: 40 cycles of 95°C for 15 seconds,
60°C for 1 minute
C) Detection and Analysis:
1. Real-Time PCR Run:
◦ Load the PCR plate into the real-time PCR instrument.
◦ Start the PCR run and monitor the amplification curves.
2. Interpretation of Results:
◦ Analyze the amplification curves and threshold cycles (Ct
values) using the instrument software.
◦ A valid run should have amplification in the positive control
and no amplification in the negative controls.
◦ Samples with Ct values within the specified range for
Dengue Virus are considered positive.
◦ Samples without a detectable Ct value or beyond the
specified threshold are considered negative.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include positive and negative controls in each RT-PCR run to
validate the assay.
• Confirm the integrity of reagents by checking expiration dates and
storage conditions.
• Monitor for contamination by including a no-template control
(NTC) in each run.
• Perform regular maintenance and calibration of equipment as per
manufacturer's recommendations.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
• Document and review the results.
• Report results in accordance with laboratory policy and
guidelines.
• Positive results should be reported immediately to the requesting
physician and the appropriate public health authorities, if required.
• Record critical values in the laboratory information system (LIS).
8. LIMITATIONS
• False negatives may occur if viral RNA is below the detection limit
or degraded.
• Contamination of reagents or specimens can lead to false-positive
results.
• Proper specimen handling and storage are crucial for accurate
results.
