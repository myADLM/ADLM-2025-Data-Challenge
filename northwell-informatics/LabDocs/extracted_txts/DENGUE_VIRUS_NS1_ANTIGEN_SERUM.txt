Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Dengue Virus NS1 Antigen, Serum
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for the accurate and reliable detection of
Dengue Virus NS1 antigen in serum samples using an enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or rapid diagnostic test (RDT)
method. This protocol ensures consistent and reproducible results,
contributing to the rapid diagnosis of Dengue Virus infection.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all laboratory personnel performing Dengue
Virus NS1 antigen testing to adhere to this SOP. The laboratory
supervisor will ensure compliance with the procedures, and any
issues or deviations must be reported to the supervisor immediately.
3. SPECIMEN
Type: Serum
Preferred/Acceptable:
• 5 mL of serum, separated from a freshly collected blood sample
within 1 hour of collection.
• Serum stored for up to 72 hours at 2-8°C. For longer storage,
serum should be frozen at -20°C or below.
Unacceptable:
• Hemolyzed, icteric, or lipemic samples.
• Serum samples stored at room temperature for more than 8
hours.
• Samples without proper labeling or missing collection date/time.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Micropipettes and tips
• Microplate reader (ELISA only)
• Incubator set at 37°C (if necessary for the test method)
• Centrifuge
• Timer
Reagents and Supplies:
• Dengue NS1 Antigen ELISA kit or Rapid Diagnostic Test kit
• Calibrated serological pipettes
• Disposable gloves
• Biohazard disposal containers
• Laboratory coat and eye protection
5. PROCEDURE
A) ELISA Method:
1. Reagent Preparation:
◦ Bring all reagents to room temperature (20-25°C) before
use.
◦ Prepare wash buffer and any other necessary reagents
according to the manufacturer's instructions.
2. Sample Preparation:
◦ Allow the serum samples to thaw completely if frozen. Mix
gently to ensure homogeneity.
3. Assay Procedure:
◦ Add 100 µL of serum sample, positive control, and negative
control to the designated wells in duplicate.
◦ Add 100 µL of the enzyme conjugate to each well. Cover the
plate and incubate at 37°C for 60 minutes.
◦ Following incubation, wash the wells 5 times with the
prepared wash buffer.
◦ Add 100 µL of substrate solution to each well and incubate
at room temperature in the dark for 10-15 minutes.
◦ Add 50 µL of stop solution to each well to halt the reaction.
◦ Measure the optical density (OD) at 450 nm using the
microplate reader within 30 minutes of adding the stop
solution.
4. Data Interpretation and Analysis:
◦ Calculate the average OD for each control and specimen.
◦ Determine the cut-off value according to the kit instructions
and interpret results.
◦ Record all results, including positive, negative, and
indeterminate outcomes.
B) Rapid Diagnostic Test (RDT) Method:
1. Reagent Preparation:
◦ Bring all components of the RDT kit to room temperature
before use.
2. Sample Preparation:
◦ Allow serum samples to thaw completely if frozen. Mix
gently to ensure homogeneity.
3. Assay Procedure:
◦ Place the test device on a flat, dry surface.
◦ Add the specified volume of serum sample (usually 100 µL
or per kit instructions) into the sample well.
◦ Add the appropriate number of drops of buffer solution
(provided in the kit) into the buffer well.
◦ Allow the device to sit undisturbed for the manufacturer-
specified time (usually 15-30 minutes).
4. Data Interpretation and Analysis:
◦ Read the test results according to the manufacturer's
instructions. A positive result is usually indicated by the
appearance of a test line along with the control line.
◦ Record all results, including positive, negative, and invalid
outcomes.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform quality control assays with each batch of samples using
positive and negative control sera.
• Document all quality control procedures and ensure the results
fall within acceptable ranges before releasing patient results.
• In case of QC failure, do not proceed with sample testing until the
issue has been resolved and documented.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
• Enter all results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Ensure all positive, negative, and indeterminate results are
reviewed and verified by a certified technologist.
• Critical results should be communicated to the relevant healthcare
provider immediately following laboratory protocol.

• Relevant laboratory SOPs and QC protocols
9. DOCUMENTATION
All steps, observations, and results should be documented in the
laboratory record, including any deviations from the protocol and
corrective actions taken.
10. SAFETY
• Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) at all
times.
• Follow biosafety and waste disposal guidelines strictly.
• Handle all specimens as potentially infectious material.
By following this SOP, laboratory personnel will ensure the accurate
and reliable detection of dengue virus NS1 antigen, contributing to
timely and effective patient care.
