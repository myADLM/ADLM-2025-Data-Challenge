Sure, here is the protocol for the analytical phase of generating
results for Dentatorubral-Pallidoluysian Atrophy (DRPLA) Gene
Analysis:
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this document is to outline the procedure for
performing and generating results for the DRPLA gene analysis.
Dentatorubral-Pallidoluysian Atrophy (DRPLA) is a
neurodegenerative disorder caused by mutations in the ATN1 gene.
This SOP provides a standardized method to ensure accurate,
reliable, and reproducible results for DRPLA gene analysis.
Responsibility:
• Designated staff and laboratory technologists are responsible for
performing the gene analysis according to this SOP.
• Laboratory supervisors are responsible for ensuring adherence to
this SOP and addressing any discrepancies or issues that may
arise during the analysis.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Thermal Cycler
• Electrophoresis apparatus
• PCR reagents (DNA polymerase, dNTPs, primers, buffer)
• DNA extraction kit
• Gel documentation system
• Micropipettes and sterile filter tips
• Ethanol
• Nuclease-free water
• Agarose gel and Ethidium bromide (or alternative non-toxic dye)
• Positive control (known DRPLA-positive sample)
• Negative control (no-template control)
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Whole blood collected in EDTA tubes
• Extracted DNA should be stored at -20°C until ready for analysis
1. PROCEDURE
A) DNA Extraction:
1. Extract DNA from whole blood using standardized DNA
extraction kits following the manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Perform quality and quantity assessment of the extracted DNA
using a spectrophotometer (260/280 ratio) or fluorometer.
B) Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR):
1. Design specific primers for the ATN1 gene regions associated
with DRPLA.
2. Prepare the PCR mix as follows:
◦ DNA template: 100 ng
◦ Forward primer: 10 µM
◦ Reverse primer: 10 µM
◦ dNTPs: 200 µM each
◦ PCR buffer (with MgCl2): 1X
◦ DNA polymerase: as per manufacturer’s recommendation
◦ Nuclease-free water to final desired volume (usually 50 µL)
3. Mix by gentle pipetting and load the PCR reaction tubes into the
thermal cycler.
4. Use the following PCR cycling conditions:
◦ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 2 minutes
◦ 35 cycles of:
▪ Denaturation: 95°C for 30 seconds
▪ Annealing: Optimized temperature for 30 seconds
▪ Extension: 72°C for 1 minute
◦ Final extension: 72°C for 5 minutes
◦ Hold: 4°C
C) Agarose Gel Electrophoresis:
1. Prepare a 2% agarose gel with Ethidium bromide (or safe
alternative).
2. Load 10 µL of PCR product mixed with 2 µL of loading dye into
each gel well.
3. Include a DNA ladder for size comparison alongside positive
and negative controls.
4. Run the gel at 100 volts for approximately 1 hour or until the
dye front has migrated an appropriate distance.
5. Visualize bands using a gel documentation system under UV
light.
D) Interpretation of Results:
1. Compare the sample bands with the DNA ladder to determine
the size of the PCR products.
2. The presence of specific band sizes indicates mutation or
expansion in the ATN1 gene (consult DRPLA gene size
variability references for interpretation).
3. Include results from positive and negative controls for validity.
4. REPORTING RESULTS
5. Document the gel electrophoresis results meticulously.
6. Provide findings in the following format:
◦ Patient ID
◦ Sample ID
◦ PCR product size
◦ Interpretation (mutation positive/negative, size of expansion
if identifiable)
7. Results must be reviewed and verified by a second qualified
technologist or supervisor.
8. Upload and record the results in the Laboratory Information
System (LIS), and generate the final report for clinical use.
9. QUALITY CONTROL
10. Include both positive and negative controls in every PCR run to
ensure assay integrity.
11. Perform periodic proficiency testing and participate in external
quality assessment schemes to validate the accuracy and
precision of the gene analysis.
12. Maintain equipment calibration and perform routine
maintenance as outlined in the manufacturer's manual.
