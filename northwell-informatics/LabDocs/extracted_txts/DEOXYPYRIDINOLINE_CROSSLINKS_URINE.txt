STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP): Analytical Phase
Protocol for Deoxypyridinoline Crosslinks, Urine (DPD, Urine)
1. PURPOSE To provide a standardized procedure for the
analysis of deoxypyridinoline crosslinks in urine, ensuring
accurate and reliable results are generated.
Responsibility: It is the responsibility of all laboratory personnel to
follow this protocol to ensure the integrity and accuracy of the DPD
urine test results. All steps must be documented, and any
discrepancies or deviations should be reported to a supervisor
immediately.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Preferred/acceptable:
• First-morning voided urine is preferred.
• Specimen should be collected in a clean, dry container without
preservatives.
• Minimum volume of 10 mL is required.
Unacceptable:
• Specimens with visible contamination.
• Specimens collected in containers with preservatives.
• Urine samples that have been left at room temperature for more
than 4 hours without refrigeration.
Specimen Storage and Stability:
• Urine specimens should be stored at 2-8°C if analysis is to be
performed within 24 hours.
• For longer storage, specimens should be frozen at -20°C or
colder.
• Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• DPD Urine ELISA kit
• Microplate reader capable of measuring at 450 nm
• Calibrated pipettes and tips
• Distilled or deionized water
• Timer
• Absorbent wipes
• Clean test tubes or sample cups
• Vortex mixer
• Waste container for biological waste
1. PROCEDURE A) Sample Preparation:
2. Thaw frozen specimens at room temperature. Mix well by
gentle inversion or vortexing. Ensure samples are
homogeneous.
3. If the sample is cloudy, centrifuge at 1500 x g for 10 minutes
and use the clear supernatant.
B) Assay Procedure: Follow the manufacturer's instructions provided
with the DPD Urine ELISA kit. The general steps are as follows:
1. Allow all reagents and samples to reach room temperature
before use.
2. Add standards, controls, and samples into the designated wells
of the ELISA plate.
3. Add the appropriate enzyme conjugate to each well.
4. Incubate the plate for the specified time at the specified
temperature.
5. Wash the plate to remove unbound components.
6. Add the substrate solution to each well and incubate for the
specified time.
7. Add the stop solution to each well.
8. Measure the absorbance of each well at 450 nm using a
microplate reader.
C) Calculation of Results:
1. Generate a standard curve using the absorbance values of the
known standards.
2. Calculate the concentration of DPD in the urine samples by
interpolating the absorbance values from the standard curve.
3. Report the results in nmol DPD/mmol creatinine to account for
urine dilution.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include appropriate positive and negative controls in each assay
run.
• Perform quality control with at least two levels of controls.
• Record and monitor the quality control results. If results fall
outside of acceptable ranges, troubleshoot and re-assay as
necessary.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results should be reviewed and verified by the technologist.
• Report results in SI units (nmol DPD/mmol creatinine).
• Document all findings and maintain records in the laboratory
information system (LIS).
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Pediatric (2-10 yrs): 50-450 nmol DPD/mmol Cr
• Adult females: 3.0-7.4 nmol/mL
• Adult males: 2.3-5.4 nmol/mL
Note: Reference intervals may vary. Confirm with current literature or
laboratory-established values.
1. INTERPRETATION Elevated levels of DPD may indicate
increased bone resorption as seen in conditions such as
osteoporosis, Paget's disease, and metastatic bone disease.
2. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemoglobin, bilirubin, and lipids in the urine may interfere with the
assay results.
• Repeated freeze-thaw cycles can degrade the specimen and lead
to inaccurate results.
• Ensure all components of the assay kit are within their expiration
dates.
