Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Analytical Phase:
Dermatopathology Consultation, Wet Tissue
1. PURPOSE
To establish a standardized procedure for generating results for
dermatopathology consultation using wet tissue specimens in the
laboratory. This procedure ensures quality, accuracy, and timely
reporting of dermatopathology results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
The designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the
analytical procedures and generating results for dermatopathology
consultations using wet tissue specimens according to the defined
protocol. Supervisors are responsible for ensuring adherence to the
procedures and addressing any issues that may arise during the
process.
3. DEFINITION
Dermatopathology consultation refers to the detailed examination
and evaluation of skin tissue specimens by experienced pathologists
to diagnose skin disorders, infections, neoplasms, and other
dermatological conditions.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND ACCEPTABILITY
Specimen Type: Wet skin tissue Preferred Specimens: Freshly
excised skin tissue preserved in a suitable fixative such as formalin.
Specimen Storage Condition: Room temperature Specimen Stability:
Specimens preserved in formalin are stable for an extended period;
they should be processed within 48 hours for optimal results.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens not properly preserved.
• Specimens with incomplete clinical information or identification.
• Specimens arriving in the laboratory beyond the acceptable time
frame.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Tissue processor
• Microtome
• Slide stainer
• Coverslips
• Fixatives (Formalin)
• Staining reagents (Hematoxylin, Eosin, Special Stains)
6. PROCEDURE
A) Tissue Processing:
1. Inspect the specimen for proper identification and preservation.
2. Transfer the wet tissue specimen to the tissue processor for
dehydration, clearing, and infiltration with paraffin.
3. Ensure the tissue processor parameters are set according to
the manufacturer's instructions.
4. After processing, embed the tissue in paraffin blocks.
B) Tissue Sectioning:
1. Secure the paraffin-embedded tissue block in the microtome.
2. Cut thin sections (3-5 microns) from the tissue block.
3. Float the sections on a water bath and transfer to microscope
slides.
4. Allow slides to dry.
C) Staining:
1. Place dried slides in a staining rack.
2. Perform hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining for initial
evaluation.
◦ Immerse slides in hematoxylin solution for 3-5 minutes.
◦ Rinse slides in water.
◦ Immerse slides in eosin solution for 1-2 minutes.
◦ Rinse slides and dehydrate through graded alcohols and
clear with xylene.
3. Apply special stains or immunohistochemical stains as
requested by the dermatopathologist.
◦ Follow manufacturer’s guidelines for each special stain
protocol.
D) Coverslip Application:
1. Apply coverslips to stained slides using mounting medium.
2. Make sure no air bubbles are trapped under the coverslip.
E) Microscopic Examination:
1. Perform a detailed microscopic examination of stained slides.
2. Document findings, including any pathological features
observed.
F) Reporting Results:
1. Compile the results, interpretations, and microscopic findings
into a comprehensive dermatopathology report.
2. Review the report for accuracy and completeness.
3. Submit the final report to the consulting dermatologist or
referring physician.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
Maintain daily logs for equipment calibration and maintenance.
Ensure proper stain quality and consistency by performing routine
control checks. Document corrective actions taken for any
discrepancies or issues during the procedure. Verify that the
specimen is properly labeled and matches the patient information.
Perform regular inter-laboratory comparisons to ensure result
accuracy.
8. DOCUMENTATION AND REPORTING
1. Maintain detailed records for each specimen, including
processing details, stain protocols, and microscopic findings.
2. Follow site-specific guidelines for reporting and archiving
results.
9. REFERENCES
Refer to standard dermatopathology texts and manufacturer
instructions for equipment and reagent use.
This SOP is up to date as of October 2023 and must be reviewed
annually or upon any changes to procedure or equipment.
End of protocol.
Please ensure all sections are strictly followed to maintain laboratory
standards and accreditation compliance.
