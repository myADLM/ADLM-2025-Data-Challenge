Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Dermatopathology Exam of
Tissue
1. PURPOSE To establish a standardized procedure for the
analysis and interpretation of dermatopathology tissue
specimens. This SOP ensures consistent, accurate, and timely
results for dermatologic evaluations, aiding in appropriate
diagnosis and management of skin conditions.
Responsibility: It is the responsibility of trained laboratory personnel
to carry out the procedures outlined in this SOP. It is the duty of the
laboratory supervisors to oversee the workflow, ensuring compliance
and addressing any discrepancies or issues that arise.
1. DEFINITION Dermatopathology exam refers to the microscopic
examination and diagnosis of skin diseases through the
evaluation of tissue sections.
2. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Reception and Accessioning:
• Confirm that each specimen is properly labeled with two patient
identifiers (e.g., name, DOB) and that it is accompanied by a
completed requisition form with relevant clinical information.
• Accession the specimen in the laboratory information system
(LIS) and assign a unique identifier.
B. Tissue Grossing:
• Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE).
• Inspect the specimen, noting size, color, and any other relevant
characteristics.
• Describe the specimen in detail in the grossing log.
• If necessary, photograph or diagram the specimen.
C. Tissue Fixation:
• Immerse the specimen in 10% neutral buffered formalin for
adequate fixation.
• Ensure the specimen remains in formalin for an appropriate
period depending on its size (typically 6-24 hours).
D. Tissue Processing:
• Dehydrate the fixed tissue through graded alcohols (70% to
absolute alcohol).
• Clear the tissue in xylene or a xylene substitute.
• Infiltrate the tissue with molten paraffin wax.
E. Embedding and Sectioning:
• Embed the tissue in a paraffin block, ensuring proper orientation.
• Section the paraffin-embedded tissue at 4-5 micrometers
thickness using a microtome.
• Float the sections on a warm water bath and pick them up on
glass slides.
• Allow the slides to dry.
F. Staining: Primary Stain - Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E):
• De-wax the tissue sections in xylene and rehydrate through
graded alcohols to water.
• Stain the sections in hematoxylin, rinse in water, differentiate in
acid alcohol if necessary, and blue the sections in alkaline water.
• Counterstain in eosin, dehydrate through graded alcohols, clear in
xylene, and mount in a suitable mounting medium.
Special Stains (if indicated):
• Perform special or immunohistochemical stains as required by the
clinician or pathologist.
G. Microscopic Examination:
• The pathologist examines the stained slides under a microscope.
• Document microscopic findings and interpret the pathology.
H. Reporting:
• Record diagnostic findings in the LIS.
• Generate a comprehensive dermatopathology report including
clinical correlation.
• Verify the report and transmit it to the requesting clinician.
I. Quality Control:
• Perform regular maintenance of equipment (microtomes, staining
machines).
• Use control slides to ensure staining reagents and procedures are
functioning correctly.
• Participate in internal and external quality assurance programs.
J. Troubleshooting:
• If poor fixation or artifact is noted, document the issue and steps
taken to rectify it.
• Consult with the supervisor or pathologist for any discrepancies or
unusual findings.
1. DOCUMENTATION
• Ensure all steps, from specimen reception to reporting, are
documented in the LIS and/or appropriate logbooks.
• Maintain records of equipment maintenance, quality control, and
any deviations from standard procedures.
