Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Generating Results for
Dermatophagoides microceras, IgE, Serum
1. Purpose: To outline the procedure for the analysis and
reporting of Dermatophagoides microceras (house dust mite)
specific Immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels in serum.
2. Scope: This protocol applies to the measurement of
Dermatophagoides microceras IgE in serum samples using an
Immunoassay technique. It is intended for use in clinical
laboratories where testing for allergens is performed.
3. Responsibility:
◦ It is the responsibility of the Medical Laboratory Scientist
(MLS) to perform the sample analysis.
◦ Supervisors ensure compliance with this procedure and
authorize the final results.
4. Materials:
◦ Immunoassay analyzer (e.g., Fluorescent Enzyme
Immunoassay system)
◦ Reagents specific for Dermatophagoides microceras IgE
◦ Serum samples
◦ Quality control materials (positive and negative controls)
◦ Calibrators
◦ Personal protective equipment (PPE)
◦ Laboratory Information System (LIS)
5. Specimen Requirements:
◦ Preferred specimen: Serum collected in a serum separator
tube (SST)
◦ Minimum volume: 200 µL
◦ Specimen must be centrifuged and serum separated within
2 hours of collection
◦ Store at 2-8°C if analysis is within 48 hours, or freeze at
-20°C for long-term storage
6. Procedure: a. Calibration and Quality Control:
◦ Perform instrument calibration using appropriate calibrators
for Dermatophagoides microceras IgE as per
manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Run positive and negative controls with each batch of
specimens and document the results.
b. Preparation:
◦ Allow all reagents, samples, and controls to reach room
temperature before use.
◦ Vortex samples and controls briefly to ensure homogeneity.
c. Sample Loading:
◦ Load patient serum samples, calibrators, and quality control
samples into the designated positions on the immunoassay
analyzer.
◦ Ensure samples are correctly identified and barcoded where
applicable.
d. Assay Procedure:
◦ Follow the specific immunoassay protocol for
Dermatophagoides microceras IgE as provided by the
manufacturer’s kit insert.
◦ Typical steps include:
1. Adding serum to the allergen-coated wells or cartridge
2. Incubating for the specified period at the
recommended temperature
3. Washing the wells or cartridge to remove unbound
substances
4. Adding enzyme-linked antibodies and incubating again
5. Adding substrate solution and measuring the
developed color or fluorescence
e. Result Calculation:
◦ The analyzer will automatically calculate the concentration
of Dermatophagoides microceras IgE in patient serum
based on the standard curve generated from the calibrators.
◦ Results are typically expressed in kilo International Units per
Liter (kIU/L).
7. Reference Range:
◦ < 0.35 kIU/L: Negative/Not detected
◦ 0.35 - 0.7 kIU/L: Low positive
◦ 0.71 - 3.5 kIU/L: Moderate positive
◦ 3.5 kIU/L: High positive
8. Quality Control:
◦ Ensure that quality control results fall within the acceptable
range provided by the manufacturer.
◦ If controls do not fall within the acceptable range,
troubleshoot and repeat the assay before reporting patient
results.
9. Recording and Reporting Results:
◦ Enter results into the LIS for review and verification.
◦ Critical or significantly abnormal results must be reviewed
and validated by the supervisor or designated personnel
prior to releasing the results.
10. Method Limitations:
◦ Results may be affected by hemolysis, lipemia, or icteric
samples.
◦ Cross-reactivity with other allergens should be considered in
the clinical interpretation of results.
