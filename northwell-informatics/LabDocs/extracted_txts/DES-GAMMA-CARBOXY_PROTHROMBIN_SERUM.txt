Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Des-gamma-carboxy Prothrombin (DCP),
Serum
1. PURPOSE
To outline the steps and responsibilities involved in the analytical
phase of generating accurate and reliable results for des-gamma-
carboxy prothrombin (DCP) in serum samples.
1. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel involved in the
analysis of DCP in serum samples using the designated
immunoassay method.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
Laboratory personnel are responsible for performing and
documenting all steps in this procedure. It is their responsibility to
identify any issues during the analytical phase and notify the
supervisor immediately.
1. DEFINITIONS
Des-gamma-carboxy Prothrombin (DCP), also known as Protein
Induced by Vitamin K Absence or Antagonist-II (PIVKA-II), is a
biomarker used in the diagnosis and monitoring of hepatocellular
carcinoma (HCC).
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Immunoassay Analyzer (e.g., Lumipulse G1200, Abbott Architect
i2000SR, etc.)
• DCP Immunoassay Kit
• Calibrators and Controls (Low, Medium, High)
• Pipettes and Tips
• Serum Separator Tubes (SST)
• Reagent Reservoirs
• Quality Control Materials
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation of Serum Samples
1. Ensure serum samples are properly collected and labelled.
2. Centrifuge samples at 1,500-2,000 x g for 10-15 minutes to
obtain a clear serum.
3. Aliquot serum into appropriate tubes if needed, store samples
at 2-8°C if analysis is performed within 24 hours or freeze at
-20°C for longer storage.
B. Calibration
1. Prepare calibrators as outlined in the DCP Immunoassay Kit
insert.
2. Load the calibrators onto the immunoassay analyzer according
to the manufacturer’s instructions.
3. Perform calibration as per the analyzer’s protocol. Ensure
calibration results fall within the acceptable range before
proceeding.
C. Quality Control
1. Prepare quality control materials (low, medium, high) as per the
kit instructions.
2. Load the quality control materials onto the analyzer.
3. Run quality control tests and verify the results are within the
acceptable range. Document results in the QC log.
4. If QC results are outside the acceptable range, troubleshoot the
issue and repeat QC tests until the results are within range.
D. Sample Analysis
1. Load patient serum samples onto the analyzer in an order that
prevents cross-contamination.
2. Enter sample IDs into the system or verify the barcoded IDs if
using an automated system.
3. Select the DCP assay protocol on the analyzer.
4. Initiate the assay run and monitor the system for any errors or
issues during the analysis.
E. Result Interpretation and Reporting
1. Review the results generated by the analyzer for each sample.
2. Verify the integrity of the results, ensuring no flags or error
codes are associated with any results.
3. Enter results into the laboratory information system (LIS).
4. Report critical values immediately to the requesting physician
as per laboratory protocol.
5. TROUBLESHOOTING
• Verify all equipment and reagents are functioning correctly if any
anomalies are detected.
• If quality control results fall outside acceptable limits, investigate
potential causes such as reagent expiration, equipment
calibration issues, or procedural errors.
• Consult the supervisor or equipment manufacturer’s technical
support for unresolved issues.
1. MAINTENANCE
• Perform daily, weekly, and monthly maintenance on the
immunoassay analyzer as per the manufacturer’s
recommendations.
• Record maintenance activities in the maintenance log.
1. DOCUMENTATION
• Ensure all steps, calibrations, quality controls, and results are
documented accurately in the appropriate logs.
• Retain records of calibration and quality control data for
compliance and quality assurance purposes.
