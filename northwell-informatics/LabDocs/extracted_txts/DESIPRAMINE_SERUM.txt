Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): DESIPRAMINE, SERUM
Analysis
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for the analysis of desipramine levels in
serum samples to ensure accurate and reliable results.
Responsibility:
• It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory personnel to
perform the analysis following this SOP.
• Laboratory supervisors are responsible for verifying that all
personnel adhere to this SOP.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/Acceptable:
• Specimen type: Serum
• Collection container: Red-top tube or serum separator tube (SST)
• Volume: Minimum of 1 mL serum
Unacceptable specimens:
• Hemolyzed specimens
• Specimens collected in anticoagulant tubes (e.g., EDTA, heparin,
sodium fluoride)
• Insufficient quantity of serum
• Specimens older than 48 hours if not frozen
Specimen Handling:
• After collection, allow the blood to clot for 30 minutes at room
temperature.
• Centrifuge the sample for 10-15 minutes at about 3000 RPM to
separate serum.
• Transfer the serum to a clean polypropylene tube for storage and
analysis.
Storage:
• Serum samples should be refrigerated at 2-8°C if analyzed within
24 hours.
• For longer storage, freeze the samples at -20°C or colder.
3. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
• High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system or liquid
chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)
• Desipramine reference standard
• Reagent-grade solvents (e.g., methanol, acetonitrile)
• Analytical balance
• Centrifuge
• Polypropylene sample tubes
• Pipettes and tips
• Sample vials compatible with HPLC/LC-MS/MS
4. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation of Calibration Standards and Quality Controls:
1. Prepare calibration standards by serially diluting the
desipramine reference standard in serum to achieve a range of
concentrations (e.g., 20 ng/mL to 1000 ng/mL).
2. Prepare quality control (QC) samples in serum at low, medium,
and high concentrations within the calibration range.
3. Aliquot and store the standards and QC samples at -20°C when
not in use.
B) Sample Preparation:
1. Thaw frozen serum samples, calibration standards, and QCs at
room temperature.
2. Vortex to mix well.
3. Pipette 500 µL of serum sample, calibration standard, or QC
into a clean polypropylene tube.
4. Add 500 µL of protein precipitation solution (e.g., methanol or
acetonitrile) to each sample.
5. Vortex for 2 minutes to ensure complete precipitation of
proteins.
6. Centrifuge the tubes at 3000 RPM for 10 minutes.
7. Transfer the supernatant to a clean HPLC/LC-MS/MS
compatible vial.
C) HPLC/LC-MS/MS Analysis:
1. Set up the HPLC/LC-MS/MS system according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Set the mobile phase and flow rate appropriate for desipramine
analysis (commonly methanol/water or acetonitrile/water with
appropriate additives such as formic acid).
3. Inject 10-20 µL of each prepared sample, standard, and QC into
the system.
4. Analyze the samples using a validated method for desipramine
detection (e.g., selected ion monitoring (SIM) or multiple
reaction monitoring (MRM) mode for LC-MS/MS).
D) Data Analysis and Reporting:
1. Process the chromatographic data to determine the
concentration of desipramine using the calibration curve.
2. Compare QC results to established criteria to ensure assay
validity.
3. Report results in ng/mL with appropriate comments on sample
integrity, if applicable.
4. Verify and electronically record the results in the laboratory
information system (LIS).
5. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include QC samples in each analytical run to monitor assay
performance.
• Acceptable limits for QC samples must fall within ±15% of the
target concentrations.
• Repeat analysis if QC samples fail to meet acceptance criteria.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results are automatically transmitted to the LIS.
• Review and verify results according to site-specific guidelines
before releasing.
• Report critical results immediately according to established
procedures.
