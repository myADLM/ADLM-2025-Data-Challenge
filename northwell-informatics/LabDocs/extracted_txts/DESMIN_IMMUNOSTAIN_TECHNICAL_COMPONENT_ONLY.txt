STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP) - DESMIN
IMMUNOSTAIN, TECHNICAL COMPONENT ONLY
1. PURPOSE
To provide detailed instructions for the technical processing, staining,
and quality control of Desmin immunostain on histologic sections.
The Desmin immunostain is used to identify Desmin protein, which is
expressed in muscle cells, aiding in the diagnosis of various muscle-
related diseases and tumors.
1. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel trained to perform
Desmin immunostaining in the laboratory.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the trained histotechnologists and laboratory
supervisors to ensure that all steps of the Desmin immunostain
protocol are followed meticulously to maintain the integrity and
accuracy of the staining process.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/Acceptable specimens:
• Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks
• Freshly cut sections, 4-5 μm thick, mounted on positively charged
microscopic slides
Unacceptable specimens:
• Unfixed or improperly fixed tissue
• Sections thicker or thinner than specified
1. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• Desmin primary antibody (validated for immunohistochemistry)
• Antigen retrieval solution (e.g., citrate buffer, pH 6.0 or EDTA
buffer, pH 8.0)
• Secondary antibody
• Detection system (e.g., Dako EnVision+ System-HRP)
• Diaminobenzidine (DAB) substrate
• Hematoxylin counterstain
• Xylene, alcohol, and mounting medium
• Positive control slide (e.g., known Desmin-positive tissue)
• Negative control slide (e.g., without primary antibody)
1. EQUIPMENT
• Microtome
• Hot water bath
• Drying oven
• Decloaking chamber or microwave for antigen retrieval
• Humidity chamber for antibody incubation
• Light microscope
1. PROCEDURE
7.1. Slide Preparation
1. Cut 4-5 μm thick sections from FFPE tissue blocks and mount
them on positively charged slides.
2. Dry the slides in a 60°C oven for at least 1 hour or overnight.
7.2. Deparaffinization and Rehydration
1. Deparaffinize slides in 3 changes of xylene, 5 minutes each.
2. Rehydrate through graded alcohols (100%, 95%, 80%, 70%) to
distilled water, 2 minutes each.
7.3. Antigen Retrieval
1. Place slides in a heat-resistant container with antigen retrieval
solution.
2. Perform antigen retrieval by heating the slides in a decloaking
chamber, microwave, or pressure cooker following
manufacturer's instructions.
3. Allow slides to cool to room temperature.
7.4. Immunostaining
1. Rinse slides in PBS or TBS buffer.
2. Block endogenous peroxidase activity with 3% hydrogen
peroxide for 10 minutes.
3. Wash slides in PBS or TBS buffer.
4. Apply primary Desmin antibody and incubate at room
temperature for 30 minutes to 1 hour (optimize based on
antibody specifications).
5. Wash slides in PBS or TBS buffer.
6. Apply secondary antibody and incubate according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
7. Wash slides in PBS or TBS buffer.
8. Apply DAB substrate and monitor microscopically for color
development (usually 5-10 minutes).
9. Rinse slides in distilled water.
10. Counterstain with hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes.
11. Rinse in tap water and blue in lithium carbonate or ammonia
water for 1 minute.
12. Dehydrate through graded alcohols (70%, 80%, 95%, 100%) to
xylene, 2 minutes each.
13. Coverslip using mounting medium.
7.5. Quality Control
1. Include a positive control slide in each batch of staining.
2. Include a negative control slide (omitting primary antibody) to
evaluate nonspecific staining.
3. Ensure staining intensity and distribution pattern on control
slides meet acceptance criteria before reviewing patient slides.
4. REPORTING RESULTS
• Desmin staining results should be reviewed microscopically by a
qualified pathologist.
• Results are reported based on the presence or absence of
Desmin staining and the pattern of expression (e.g., cytoplasmic
staining in muscle fibers).
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Inadequate fixation, improper tissue processing, or technical
errors during staining can affect results.
• Cross-reactivity or nonspecific staining may occur and should be
interpreted with caution.
• Refer to the primary antibody data sheet for individual reagent
limitations.
1. REFERENCES
• Desmin antibody product insert and technical data sheet
• Manufacturer's instructions for detection systems and ancillary
reagents
1. DOCUMENTATION
• Maintain a record of staining runs, including dates, control results,
and any deviations or corrective actions taken.
• Properly document all quality control results and instrument
maintenance logs.
This SOP should be reviewed and updated periodically to ensure
compliance with current standards and best practices in
immunohistochemistry.
