Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytic Phase:
DESMOGLEIN 1 (DSG1) AND DESMOGLEIN 3 (DSG3), IgG
ANTIBODIES, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedures for the accurate and efficient measurement
of Desmoglein 1 (DSG1) and Desmoglein 3 (DSG3) IgG antibodies in
serum.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to the measurement and reporting of DSG1 and
DSG3 IgG antibodies in serum samples in order to assist in the
diagnosis and monitoring of autoimmune blistering diseases such as
pemphigus vulgaris and pemphigus foliaceus.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of designated laboratory personnel to adhere to
this SOP and ensure that all procedures related to the measurement
of DSG1 and DSG3 IgG antibodies are performed accurately and
consistently. Laboratory supervisors are responsible for verifying that
data is generated and reported in compliance with this SOP and
other relevant guidelines.
4. DEFINITION
DSG1 and DSG3 IgG antibodies: Autoantibodies directed against
the desmosomal proteins Desmoglein 1 and Desmoglein 3, typically
measured via Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA).
5. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• ELISA Reader (capable of reading at specific absorbance
wavelengths)
• ELISA Washer (optional but preferred for washing steps)
• Incubator (37°C)
• Micropipettes (variable volume)
• Pipette tips (non-adsorptive, sterile)
• Test Tubes/ Microtiter plates
• DSG1 and DSG3 ELISA kits
• Calibrators, Controls, and Samples (stored as per manufacturer’s
recommendations)
• Wash Buffer
• Substrate Solution (TMB)
• Stop Solution (1M HCl or equivalent)
• Plate Shaker (optional but preferred)
6. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STORAGE
Specimen:
• Preferred Specimen:
◦ 5-10 mL of freshly drawn serum separated from whole blood.
Use of serum separator tubes (SSTs) is recommended.
◦ The sample should be devoid of hemolysis and stored at
2-8°C if analyzed within 48 hours. For longer storage, samples
should be frozen at -20°C or lower.
• Unacceptable Specimens:
◦ Samples with severe hemolysis, lipemia, or contamination.
◦ Specimens not appropriately labeled or stored beyond
acceptable time frames without appropriate preservation.
7. PROCEDURE
Step-by-Step Protocol:
1. Preparation:
◦ Bring all reagents and samples to room temperature
(20-25°C) before starting the assay.
◦ Ensure the ELISA reader, incubator, and washer are
correctly calibrated and in proper working condition.
2. Assay Setup:
◦ Prepare the microtiter well as instructed by the ELISA kit
manufacturer.
◦ Pipette the standards, controls, and samples into
appropriate wells. Each sample, standard, and control
should be run in duplicate.
◦ Add the conjugate reagent to each well.
3. Incubation:
◦ Incubate the plate at 37°C for the specified time as
recommended by the ELISA kit’s instructions.
4. Washing:
◦ Wash the wells thoroughly with wash buffer (typically 3-5
times) to remove any unbound materials.
5. Substrate Addition:
◦ Add the TMB substrate solution to each well and incubate at
room temperature (20-25°C) in the dark for the
recommended time.
6. Stopping the Reaction:
◦ Stop the enzymatic reaction by adding the stop solution to
each well.
7. Reading:
◦ Measure the absorbance at the specified wavelength using
the ELISA reader. Record the optical density (OD) values for
each well.
8. Calculations:
◦ Generate a standard curve using the absorbance values of
the calibrators/standards.
◦ Calculate the concentration of DSG1 and DSG3 IgG
antibodies in the samples based on the standard curve.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
To ensure the validity of results, include internal quality controls with
each batch of assays:
• Negative Control
• Positive Control
Run the controls as per the manufacturer's instructions. If control
values do not fall within the specified range, repeat the assay and/or
troubleshoot following laboratory protocols.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
• Transmit the results to the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Review and verify data before finalizing the report.
Reference Intervals:
• Desmoglein 1 IgG Antibodies: <20 U/mL (normal/negative)
• Desmoglein 3 IgG Antibodies: <20 U/mL (normal/negative)
Cut-off values may vary depending on the specific kit used and must
be interpreted according to the manufacturer’s guidelines.
10. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the ELISA kit’s manufacturer insert for limitations of the
assay, including potential cross-reactivity and interferences.

12. VERSION CONTROL
This SOP should be reviewed annually or whenever there are
substantial changes in procedures, reagents, or equipment.
