Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Protocol for Desmoglein 3
(DSG3) Immunostain – Technical Component Only
1. PURPOSE
To provide clear, step-by-step guidance for performing the
Desmoglein 3 (DSG3) immunostain procedure. This protocol ensures
the consistency, accuracy, and reliability of the test results.
Responsibility: Qualified laboratory personnel are responsible for
performing and documenting the DSG3 immunostain procedures.
Staff must follow this protocol to ensure the proper execution and
reporting of results.
1. SPECIMEN
Specimen Type:
• Tissue biopsy samples fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin.
Specimen Handling and Storage:
• Specimens must be fixed in formalin for 6-24 hours.
• After fixation, tissue should be processed and embedded in
paraffin blocks.
• Unstained slides must be prepared and stored at room
temperature until use.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens that are not fixed properly or insufficiently fixed.
• Specimens with evidence of improper processing or embedding.

1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation of Slides
1. Cut tissue sections at 3-4 μm thickness using a microtome.
2. Place sections on positively charged slides.
3. Allow slides to dry overnight at room temperature or place in an
incubator at 60°C for 1 hour.
B. Deparaffinization and Rehydration
1. Heat slides in a 60°C incubator for 30 minutes.
2. Deparaffinize slides by immersing in xylene for 3 minutes (2
changes).
3. Rehydrate through a graded series of ethanol:
◦ 100% ethanol for 3 minutes (2 changes).
◦ 95% ethanol for 2 minutes.
◦ 70% ethanol for 2 minutes.
4. Rinse slides in distilled water.
C. Antigen Retrieval
1. Perform heat-induced epitope retrieval (HIER) using citrate
buffer (pH 6.0).
2. Heat slides in a microwave, pressure cooker, or water bath for
20 minutes.
3. Allow slides to cool at room temperature for 20 minutes.
4. Rinse slides in distilled water.
D. Blocking and Antibody Incubation
1. Apply blocking solution (e.g., 5% normal goat serum) to slides
and incubate for 15 minutes at room temperature to block non-
specific binding.
2. Drain slides and apply primary antibody (Anti-Desmoglein 3)
diluted as per manufacturer’s guidelines.
3. Incubate in a humid chamber at room temperature for 1 hour or
overnight at 4°C.
4. Rinse slides in PBS (phosphate-buffered saline) for 5 minutes
(3 changes).
E. Detection
1. Apply HRP-conjugated secondary antibody to slides and
incubate at room temperature for 30 minutes.
2. Rinse slides in PBS for 5 minutes (3 changes).
F. Visualization
1. Apply DAB substrate to slides and monitor under a microscope
for appropriate color development (usually 2-5 minutes).
2. Rinse slides in distilled water.
3. Counterstain with hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes.
4. Rinse slides in distilled water.
5. Dehydrate through graded ethanol series and clear in xylene.
G. Mounting
1. Apply mounting medium and coverslip.
2. Allow slides to dry completely.
3. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include positive and negative controls with each run.
• Document any staining anomalies or deviations from the expected
results.
• Perform routine maintenance and quality control checks on
equipment used.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Slides will be examined microscopically by a pathologist.
• Any deviations, artifacts, or issues noted during the staining or
microscopy should be documented.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
For interpretation by the pathologist, based on staining intensity and
pattern in comparison to controls:
Negative: No specific staining of cell membranes.
Positive: Strong, uniform membrane staining in desmosome-rich areas (e.g., epidermis).
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Improper fixation, sectioning, or antigen retrieval can result in
suboptimal staining.
• Overstaining or understaining can occur if the incubation times
are not carefully controlled.
