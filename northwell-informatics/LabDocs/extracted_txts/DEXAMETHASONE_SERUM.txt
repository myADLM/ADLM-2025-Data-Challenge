Protocol for Analytical Phase: Generating Results for
Dexamethasone, Serum
1. PURPOSE
To define the procedures for the quantitative analysis of serum
dexamethasone levels in patient samples using high-performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC) or an appropriate automated analyzer,
ensuring the accuracy, precision, and reliability of test results.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all staff members trained and authorized to
perform serum dexamethasone testing within the laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the medical laboratory scientists and
technicians to follow the protocol accurately, ensure the instrument
and reagent quality, document all actions, and communicate any
issues to the supervisor.
4. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) system or an
appropriate automated analyzer
• Dexamethasone standard solutions
• Mobile phase reagents (as specified by the HPLC method)
• Serum control materials
• Calibrators for dexamethasone
• Sample preparation materials (e.g., centrifuges, pipettes, serum
separators)
• Reagent grade solvents and consumables
• Quality control (QC) materials
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
5. SAMPLE REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Serum
• Volume: Minimum 0.5 mL of serum is preferred.
• Collection Tubes: Red-top or serum separator tubes (SST).
• Stability: Serum samples must be analyzed within 8 hours if
stored at room temperature. If stored at 2-8 °C, samples are
stable for up to 48 hours. For long-term storage, aliquot and
freeze at -20 °C or below.
6. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation of Reagents and Calibrators:
1. Prepare the mobile phase as per the HPLC method or refer to
the analyzer's instructions.
2. Prepare dexamethasone standard solutions and calibrators of
known concentrations.
3. Aliquot and store reagents and calibrators according to
manufacturer’s instructions.
B. Instrumentation Preparation:
1. Turn on HPLC system or automated analyzer and allow to
equilibrate.
2. Check instrument calibration status; perform calibration if
required.
3. Verify that the detectors and columns are functioning correctly.
4. Ensure that all necessary consumables are available.
C. Sample Processing:
1. Centrifuge collected serum samples at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes
to remove any particulate matter.
2. Transfer the clear serum to appropriately labeled sample vials
for analysis.
3. Prepare a blank, calibrators, and QC samples alongside patient
samples.
D. Running the Assay:
1. Load samples, calibrators, blanks, and QC materials onto the
HPLC or analyzer.
2. Initiate the analysis run, ensuring that sample sequence and
positions are correctly programmed.
3. Monitor the analysis to ensure the system is operating without
fault.
4. Record run identification, date, and sample identifiers in the
laboratory’s logbook or LIS.
E. Data Analysis and Result Calculation:
1. After the run is complete, verify that all quality controls fall
within the acceptable range.
2. Evaluate chromatograms for the presence of dexamethasone
peaks.
3. Calculate the concentration of dexamethasone in the patient
samples based on the calibration curve.
4. Review data for any anomalies or inconsistencies.
F. Documenting and Reporting Results:
1. Document all results including calculations, calibrations, QC
data, and any other pertinent information in the laboratory’s LIS.
2. Results must be reviewed and verified by the technologist
before being transmitted to the LIS.
3. Flag any critical values or results requiring immediate attention
according to the laboratory’s protocol.
4. Ensure results are sent to the ordering clinician promptly.
7. QUALITY CONTROL AND MAINTENANCE
1. Perform daily, weekly, and monthly maintenance on the HPLC
system or analyzer as per manufacturer’s recommendations.
2. Run quality controls (QC) with each batch of patient samples.
3. Review all QC results to ensure they are within established
ranges.
4. Any QC failures must be investigated and resolved before
patient results are reported.
5. Maintain detailed instrument logs for maintenance and QC
events.
8. LIMITATIONS
• Hemolysis, lipemia, or icterus may interfere with the assay.
• Ensure that specimen handling and storage conditions are strictly
adhered to.
9. REFERENCES
• Technical manuals and instructions from the instrument and
reagent manufacturers.
• Relevant clinical guidelines and literature.
10. APPENDICES
• Standard operating procedure for HPLC maintenance and
troubleshooting.
• Calibration curve preparation instructions.
• Troubleshooting guide for common assay issues.
