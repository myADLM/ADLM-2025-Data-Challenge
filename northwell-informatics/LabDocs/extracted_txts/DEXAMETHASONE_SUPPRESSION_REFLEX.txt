Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Dexamethasone Suppression Reflex Testing
1. PURPOSE This SOP outlines the procedures for performing the
analytical phase of dexamethasone suppression reflex testing,
ensuring that all processes are standardized, results are
accurate, and properly documented.
2. DEFINITION Dexamethasone suppression reflex testing is
used to diagnose conditions associated with abnormal cortisol
production, such as Cushing's syndrome. It measures the
suppression of cortisol production in response to
dexamethasone administration.
3. RESPONSIBILITY It is the responsibility of all trained laboratory
personnel to follow this SOP accurately and completely. Any
deviations or issues should be promptly reported to a
supervisor.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes and tips
• Dexamethasone reagent kits
• Quality control materials
• Serum cortisol assay kits
• Analyzer (ensure it is fully calibrated and within maintenance
schedule)
• Appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE)
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Only serum samples are acceptable.
• Samples must be received in a red or gold top tube (SST).
• Unacceptable specimens include those that are hemolyzed,
lipemic, or icteric.
• Samples must be received in the laboratory within 2 hours of
collection and processed as soon as possible.
1. PROCEDURE
A) Sample Preparation
1. Verify patient identity and accession number.
2. Allow serum samples to clot at room temperature for 30
minutes.
3. Centrifuge samples at 1500g for 10 minutes to separate serum.
4. Aliquot serum into labeled secondary tubes for dexamethasone
suppression analysis.
B) Assay Setup
1. Refer to the manufacturer's instructions for the dexamethasone
reagent kit and serum cortisol assay kit.
2. Perform a quality control check using control materials at the
start of each batch of tests.
3. Record quality control results in the QC log. Ensure results are
within acceptable ranges before proceeding.
C) Measurement
1. Set up the analyzer according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
2. Load the serum samples and controls into the analyzer.
3. Run the assay as programmed.
D) Data Verification and Result Generation
1. Upon completion, review the analyzer printout or electronic data
file.
2. Validate the results by comparing controls to the expected
ranges. If control results are outside acceptable limits,
troubleshoot as necessary before accepting patient results.
3. Interpret the cortisol suppression results according to the
following criteria:
◦ Normal Function: Cortisol levels suppressed to <1.8 µg/dL
post-dexamethasone.
◦ Abnormal Function: Cortisol levels remain >1.8 µg/dL post-
dexamethasone.
E) Troubleshooting
1. If any result appears questionable (e.g., significantly high
baseline or flat suppression despite clinical context), re-run the
test using a new aliquot.
2. Document any issues and corrective actions in the assay log.
3. REPORTING RESULTS
4. Enter validated results into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
5. Ensure results are properly labeled with the patient’s
information, collection time, and result interpretation.
6. Use report comments for any flags or notes if abnormal results
are identified.
7. QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE A) Internal QC
• Perform QC checks at the beginning of each shift, and whenever
a new reagent kit is opened.
• Use two levels of control materials (low and high). B) External QC
• Participate in an external quality assurance program and
document the comparison. C) Proficiency Testing
• Participate in proficiency testing programs and review results to
ensure quality performance.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Cortisol suppression post-dexamethasone: <1.8 µg/dL for normal
response.
1. DOCUMENTATION Ensure that all data, including patient
results, QC data, and any deviations from the SOP, are properly
documented and stored according to regulatory and laboratory
policies.
