Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase Protocol for Dextroamphetamine (Dexedrine)
Quantification
1. PURPOSE
To define the procedures for the quantification of Dextroamphetamine
(Dexedrine) levels in biological specimens (e.g., blood, urine) to
ensure accurate, consistent, and reproducible results.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel responsible for
performing and verifying the quantification of Dextroamphetamine
(Dexedrine) in biological specimens.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
Laboratory personnel are responsible for:
• Performing the assay as described in this procedure.
• Documenting all relevant information and data.
• Reporting any deviations to the laboratory supervisor.
• Ensuring the quality control (QC) procedures are followed.
• Performing corrective actions as necessary.
4. DEFINITIONS
Dextroamphetamine (Dexedrine): A potent central nervous system
stimulant commonly prescribed for treating attention deficit
hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and narcolepsy.
QC: Quality Control
LIS: Laboratory Information System
5. MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT
1. Dextroamphetamine standard solutions.
2. Internal standard (e.g., Methamphetamine-d3).
3. Biological specimen collection supplies (e.g., blood collection
tubes, urine cups).
4. Analytical equipment: High-Performance Liquid
Chromatography (HPLC) or Liquid Chromatography-Mass
Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).
5. Calibration standards and QC materials.
6. Appropriate solvent (e.g., acetonitrile, methanol).
7. Pipettes and other routine laboratory consumables.
8. Temperature-controlled storage facilities.
6. PROCEDURE
6.1 Preparation of Calibration Standards and QC Samples
1. Prepare calibration standards by diluting a known concentration
of Dextroamphetamine in a matrix-matched solution (e.g., blank
urine or serum).
2. Prepare QC samples at three levels (low, mid, high) by spiking
blank biological matrices with a known concentration of
Dextroamphetamine.
3. Store the calibration standards and QC samples at appropriate
conditions.
6.2 Specimen Processing
1. Receive and log the specimens into the LIS.
2. Confirm specimens meet acceptance criteria (e.g., correct
labeling, within stability period).
3. Centrifuge blood specimens to separate serum/plasma if
necessary.
4. Store specimens under appropriate conditions until analysis.
6.3 Sample Preparation
1. Aliquot appropriate volumes of the biological specimen into
sample preparation tubes.
2. Add internal standard solution to each specimen.
3. Perform extraction through solid-phase extraction (SPE) or
liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) to purify Dextroamphetamine from
the matrix.
4. Evaporate the solvent under nitrogen gas if required and
reconstitute in the mobile phase.
6.4 Instrument Setup and Calibration
1. Set up the HPLC or LC-MS/MS according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
2. Calibrate the instrument using prepared calibration standards.
3. Perform system suitability tests to ensure the instrument is
functioning correctly.
6.5 Assay Procedure
1. Inject prepared samples, calibration standards, and QC
samples into the chromatographic system.
2. Analyze according to the programmed method parameters
(e.g., flow rate, column temperature, mobile phase
composition).
3. Ensure each batch contains a calibration curve, QC samples,
and patient specimens.
6.6 Data Review and Validation
1. Review chromatograms and ensure peaks correspond to
Dextroamphetamine and internal standard retention times.
2. Calculate the concentration of Dextroamphetamine in each
specimen using the calibration curve.
3. Verify the performance of the assay by comparing QC sample
results to established acceptance criteria.
4. Document any deviations and corrective actions taken.
6.7 Reporting Results
1. Enter validated results into the LIS.
2. Review and authorize results for clinical reporting.
3. Report critical values immediately according to laboratory
policy.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Analyze QC samples with each batch of specimens.
2. Review QC results and ensure they fall within the established
acceptance criteria prior to reporting patient results.
3. Perform regular maintenance and calibration of instruments as
per the manufacturer's guidelines.
8. SAFETY AND WASTE DISPOSAL
1. Follow all laboratory safety guidelines to prevent exposure to
hazardous materials.
2. Dispose of biological and chemical waste as per the
laboratory’s waste disposal procedures.
