Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Analytical Phase for
DEXTROMETHORPHAN (DM), SERUM
1. PURPOSE
This protocol outlines the steps necessary to accurately analyze and
generate results for Dextromethorphan (DM) in serum samples. It
details the responsibilities, specimen handling, equipment, reagents,
quality control, and proper documentation to ensure the integrity and
reliability of test results.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel responsible for
analyzing serum samples for Dextromethorphan (DM) at the CLIA-
certified laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all trained laboratory staff to follow this SOP
accurately and ensure that all steps are documented appropriately.
The trained laboratory supervisor must review, verify the results, and
handle any discrepancies or issues that arise during the analysis.
4. DEFINITION
Dextromethorphan (DM): A common over-the-counter medication
used as a cough suppressant.
5. PRINCIPLE
The determination of Dextromethorphan (DM) concentration in serum
is performed using High-Performance Liquid Chromatography
(HPLC) with a UV detector. The method is based on the separation of
DM from serum proteins and other constituents, followed by
quantification based on a calibration curve.
6. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
A. Preferred/Acceptable Specimens:
• Serum separated from a blood sample drawn in a red-top tube
(no additive) or serum separator tube (SST).
• The sample must be centrifuged and the serum separated within
2 hours of collection.
• Store samples at 2-8°C if analysis is to be performed within 48
hours. For longer storage, freeze samples at -20°C or below.
B. Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
• Samples received more than 24 hours after collection without
refrigeration or more than 72 hours without freezing.
7. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
• HPLC system with UV detector
• Analytical balance
• Centrifuge
• Micropipettes and tips
• Autosampler vials
• HPLC-grade solvents
• DM standard solutions
• Reagents for serum extraction (e.g., acetonitrile)
8. REAGENTS PREPARATION
Prepare HPLC mobile phase as specified in the method guidelines.
Prepare the DM standard solutions by dissolving the appropriate
amount of DM in a suitable solvent to get desired concentrations.
Prepare quality control (QC) samples using pooled human serum
spiked with known concentrations of DM.
9. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation:
1. Thaw frozen serum samples at room temperature.
2. Vortex serum samples to ensure homogeneity.
3. Pipette a specified volume of serum (e.g., 500 µL) into labelled
centrifuge tubes.
B. Protein Precipitation:
1. Add an equal volume of acetonitrile to each serum sample to
precipitate proteins.
2. Vortex the mixture for 1 minute.
3. Centrifuge the mixture at 10,000 g for 10 minutes.
4. Transfer the supernatant to a clean autosampler vial.
C. HPLC Analysis:
1. Set up the HPLC system according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
2. Inject the supernatant into the HPLC system.
3. Run the samples along with calibration standards and QC
samples.
4. Monitor and record the chromatograms.
D. Calculation:
1. Integrate the peaks in the chromatogram corresponding to DM.
2. Use the calibration curve to determine the concentration of DM
in each sample.
10. QUALITY CONTROL
Internal Quality Control:
• Run low, medium, and high-level QC samples with each batch of
analysis.
• Ensure that the QC samples fall within the acceptable limits
specified by the laboratory.
External Quality Assurance:
• Participate in external proficiency testing programs.
11. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Review the results for accuracy and consistency.
2. Record the results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
3. Any results outside the clinical reference range should be
flagged and immediately reported to the requesting physician
following the laboratory's critical results notification policy.
12. DOCUMENTATION
All steps, from sample receipt to result reporting, must be
documented in the appropriate logs and LIS.
13. TROUBLESHOOTING
If any issue arises during the analysis, follow the equipment
troubleshooting guidelines provided by the HPLC system
manufacturer. Notify the laboratory supervisor of any unresolved
issues.
