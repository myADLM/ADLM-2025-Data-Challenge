Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analysis of
DEXTRO/LEVO METHORPHAN in UMBILICAL CORD TISSUE
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedure for the accurate
and reliable analysis of DEXTRO/LEVO METHORPHAN in umbilical
cord tissue samples in the laboratory.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to the analytical phase of generating results
for DEXTRO/LEVO METHORPHAN in umbilical cord tissue. The
specimen has already been collected, received, and accessioned.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of designated laboratory personnel to perform
the analysis following this SOP. Supervisors are responsible for
ensuring compliance and addressing any issues that may arise
during the procedure.
4. DEFINITION
DEXTRO/LEVO METHORPHAN is a synthetic opioid used in
medications with potential for drug abuse. Analysis of umbilical cord
tissue helps in assessing exposure in newborns.
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred specimen: Umbilical cord tissue (minimum 6 inches
long).
• Storage: Keep refrigerated at 2-8°C if analysis is to be carried out
within 48 hours. For longer storage, freeze at -20°C.
• Unacceptable specimen: Specimens that are decayed, visibly
contaminated, or not stored within the specified conditions.
6. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• Methanol
• Water (HPLC grade)
• Acetonitrile
• Calibration standards: DEXTRO/LEVO METHORPHAN
• Internal standard
• Extraction solvents: Ethyl acetate
• Mobile phase: Methanol and water solution
• Analytical balance
• Centrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• HPLC system with UV detector
7. PROCEDURE
Preparation of Calibration Standards and Quality Controls:
1. Prepare calibration standards by diluting the stock solution of
DEXTRO/LEVO METHORPHAN in methanol.
2. Prepare quality controls (QCs) at low, medium, and high
concentrations using methanol.
Sample Preparation:
1. Homogenization:
◦ Collect the umbilical cord tissue and homogenize
(approximately 1 gram) in methanol using a homogenizer.
◦ Vortex the homogenized tissue for 2 minutes.
2. Extraction:
◦ Add the internal standard to homogenized samples,
calibration standards, and QCs.
◦ Perform liquid-liquid extraction by adding ethyl acetate,
followed by vortexing for 2 minutes.
◦ Centrifuge at 4000 rpm for 10 minutes.
◦ Transfer the organic layer to a clean vial.
◦ Evaporate the solvent under a gentle stream of nitrogen at
room temperature.
◦ Reconstitute the residue in the mobile phase
(methanol:water, 50:50).
HPLC Analysis:
1. System Setup:
◦ Turn on HPLC and UV detector. Allow the system to
equilibrate with the mobile phase for at least 30 minutes.
◦ Set the HPLC parameters: Flow rate: 1.0 mL/min, Injection
volume: 10 µL, UV detection: 214 nm.
2. Sample Injection:
◦ Inject the reconstituted extracts, calibration standards, and
QCs into the HPLC system.
◦ Run a blank sample before and after the analytical run to
ensure there is no carryover.
3. Data Analysis:
◦ Analyze chromatograms and quantify DEXTRO/LEVO
METHORPHAN using the calibration curve created from
standards.
◦ Verify results against QCs to ensure they fall within the
acceptable range.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Review and verify results following the laboratory information
system (LIS) guidelines.
• Report concentrations observed in the sample. Include comments
if any sample deviates due to analytical issues.
9. QUALITY CONTROL
• Ensure each batch includes a blank, standards, and at least three
QCs.
• If QC fails, identify and rectify the issue before continuing the
sample analysis.
• Maintain QC logs to track and trend performance.
10. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Specificity and sensitivity depend on the method and
instrumentation used.
• Refer to HPLC instrumentation guides for detailed method
limitations.
11. DOCUMENTATION AND RECORD KEEPING
• Document all sample preparation steps, HPLC settings, and data
analysis results in the laboratory’s record-keeping system.
• Maintain calibration curves and QC results for data integrity
verification.
