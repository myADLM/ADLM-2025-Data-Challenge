Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Diabetes Mellitus Type 1
Evaluation, Serum Analysis
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this document is to outline the
procedure for analyzing serum samples for the evaluation of
Diabetes Mellitus Type 1, ensuring consistent and accurate test
results.
Responsibility: It is the responsibility of certified laboratory
technologists to perform and document the analysis as per this SOP.
The laboratory supervisor is responsible for ensuring all personnel
are adequately trained and fully understand this procedure.
1. SPECIMEN Sample Requirements:
• Preferred/acceptable: 5 - 7 mL of venous blood collected in an
SST (Serum Separator Tube).
• Specimen stability:
◦ Serum should be separated from cells within 2 hours of
collection.
◦ Serum is stable for up to 48 hours at 2-8°C and up to 6
months when frozen at -20°C.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens that are hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric.
• Specimens not properly labeled or those without collection date/
time.
Specimen Handling:
• Centrifuge the SST tube for 10 minutes at 3000 RPM.
• Carefully aliquot the serum into a clean, properly labeled tube.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Analyzer: Chemiluminescent Immunoassay Analyzer or applicable
validated equipment.
• Reagents: Manufacturer-provided reagents specific for
autoantibodies and C-Peptide used in diagnosis and monitoring of
Type 1 Diabetes.
◦ Anti-Glutamic Acid Decarboxylase (GAD) Antibodies
◦ Anti-Islet Cell Antibodies (ICA)
◦ C-Peptide
• Quality control material
• Calibrators and controls as specified by the reagent manufacturer
1. PROCEDURE A. Calibration:
• Perform initial calibration using the manufacturer's recommended
calibrators.
• Subsequent calibrations must follow the manufacturer's guidelines
or be performed as per the instrument's predetermined schedule.
B. Quality Control:
• Run Low, Medium, and High control levels at the beginning of
each shift.
• Analyze an additional control sample after every 20 patient
samples.
• Document QC results and confirm they fall within acceptable
limits before processing patient samples. If QC fails, troubleshoot
according to the manufacturer’s guidelines and do not report
patient results until QC passes.
C. Analytical Steps:
1. Programming the Analyzer:
◦ Enter patient identification data into the LIS and ensure
accurate link between specimen and patient data.
◦ Select the specific autoantibody panel and C-Peptide test
from the assay list.
2. Running the Assay:
◦ Load serum samples, calibrators, and quality control
materials into the analyzer.
◦ Follow the instrument’s prompts to run the tests.
◦ Record the time, date, and technician initials performing the
analysis.
3. Reviewing and Verifying Results:
◦ Retrieve results from the LIS and verify that all controls were
within acceptable ranges.
◦ If controls are within limits, review patient results.
◦ If any individual test falls outside expected ranges, consider
sample integrity and instrument function, and repeat the
assay if necessary.
4. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results must be reviewed and verified before being reported.
• Critical values must be communicated to the physician or
appropriate healthcare provider immediately as per Critical Value
Reporting policy.
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS) for
permanent record-keeping.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Anti-GAD Antibodies: Negative <5 IU/mL
• Anti-Islet Cell Antibodies (ICA): Negative
• C-Peptide: 0.8-3.1 ng/mL (non-fasting), 1.1-5.0 ng/mL (fasting)
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolysis, lipemia, or icterus may affect results.
• Cross-reactivity with other immunological conditions may interfere
with specific antibody testing.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's kit inserts for individual reagents
• Peer-reviewed literature on Diabetes Mellitus Type 1 diagnostic
criteria
1. TROUBLESHOOTING
• Repeat testing for inconsistent results.
• Consult the manufacturer’s guidelines for any technical issues
with reagents or equipment.
• Document troubleshooting steps taken and their outcomes.
1. DOCUMENTATION
• Maintain thorough records of each test, including patient ID, date
of analysis, results, and the initials of the operating technologist.
• QC and calibration logs must be maintained as per laboratory
protocol.
This SOP shall be reviewed annually and updated as necessary to
comply with current standards and practices.
