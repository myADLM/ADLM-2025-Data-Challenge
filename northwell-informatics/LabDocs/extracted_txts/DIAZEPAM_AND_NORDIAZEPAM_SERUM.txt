Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Diazepam and Nordiazepam, Serum
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for analyzing serum samples for the
presence and concentration of Diazepam and Nordiazepam,
ensuring accurate and reliable results.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of designated laboratory personnel to follow this
procedure accurately and to ensure proper documentation.
2. PRINCIPLE
Diazepam and Nordiazepam, a metabolite of Diazepam, are detected
and quantified from serum samples using Gas Chromatography-
Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) or High Performance Liquid
Chromatography (HPLC) coupled with appropriate detectors. This
method ensures sensitivity and specificity for accurate quantitation.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred Specimen:
• Serum collected in red-top or serum separator tubes (SST).
• Minimum volume: 2 mL of serum.
Specimen Stability:
• Serum specimens should be stored at 4°C and analyzed within 72
hours.
• For long-term storage, serum may be frozen at -20°C for up to 6
months.
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Specimens in EDTA tubes or other anticoagulants are not
acceptable.
• Grossly hemolyzed, lipemic, or contaminated specimens are
unsuitable for analysis.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• GC-MS or HPLC instrument, validated for use with
benzodiazepines.
• Analytical balance.
• Centrifuge.
• Autosampler vials.
• Volumetric flasks and micropipettes.
Reagents and Supplies:
• Certified Diazepam and Nordiazepam standards.
• Internal standard (e.g., Diazepam-d5).
• High-purity solvents (methanol, acetonitrile).
• Mobile phase reagents for HPLC (e.g., water, buffer solutions).
• Derivatization reagents if required.
• Calibration and quality control materials.
5. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation
1. Verify specimen integrity and acceptability upon receipt.
2. Centrifuge blood collection tubes at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes to
separate serum.
3. Transfer serum into appropriately labeled aliquot vials.
B) Extraction
1. Prepare extraction buffer according to standard protocol.
2. Add internal standard to each serum sample.
3. Perform liquid-liquid extraction using the extraction buffer
followed by centrifugation.
◦ Transfer the organic phase containing the analytes into
autosampler vials.
C) Calibration and Quality Control
1. Prepare calibration standards across the expected range of
concentrations for Diazepam and Nordiazepam.
2. Include both positive and negative controls (QC samples) with
each analytical run.
3. Analyze calibration standards to generate a calibration curve.
4. Analyze QC samples to verify system performance.
D) Instrumental Analysis
1. Set up the GC-MS or HPLC according to manufacturer
specifications, ensuring optimal conditions for separation and
detection of Diazepam and Nordiazepam.
2. Inject extracted samples along with calibration and QC
standards.
3. Monitor procedural blanks to ensure no cross-contamination.
E) Data Analysis
1. Utilize calibration curve to quantify the concentrations of
Diazepam and Nordiazepam in each sample.
2. Review chromatograms for peak integrity and specificity.
3. Apply appropriate integration parameters and corrections for
accurate results.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
a) Document raw data in accordance with lab policy. b) Transmit
analyzed results to LIS and review for accuracy. c) Review and verify
results before reporting to ensure compliance with QA/QC criteria.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Analyze QC samples at the beginning, middle, and end of each
analytical batch.
• Monthly correlation of instrument results with external standards
for calibration verification.
• Immediate troubleshooting and corrective action if QC fails or
discrepancies are found.
8. LIMITATIONS
• Ensure all reagents are within their expiry dates.
• Grossly hemolyzed or lipemic samples may interfere with analytic
accuracy.
• Sub-optimal storage conditions may compromise sample integrity.

10. DOCUMENTATION
All steps, corrective actions, and final results should be documented
in appropriate lab records and logs.
