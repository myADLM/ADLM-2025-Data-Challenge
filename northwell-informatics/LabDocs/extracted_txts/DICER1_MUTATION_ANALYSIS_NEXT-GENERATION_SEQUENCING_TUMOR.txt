4. PROCEDURE
A. DNA Extraction from Tumor Tissue
1. FFPE Tissue:
◦ Section FFPE blocks at 5-10 µm thickness using a
microtome.
◦ Transfer sections into microcentrifuge tubes.
◦ Deparaffinize sections in xylene, followed by rehydration in a
graded ethanol series.
◦ Extract DNA using the FFPE DNA extraction kit following
manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Fresh-Frozen Tissue:
◦ Thaw the tissue on ice.
◦ Homogenize the tissue using a tissue grinder or similar
device.
◦ Extract DNA using the appropriate tissue DNA extraction kit.
B. DNA Quantification and Quality Assessment
1. Measure DNA concentration using Qubit or NanoDrop
spectrophotometer.
2. Assess DNA integrity using a Bioanalyzer or TapeStation.
3. Record the DNA concentration and quality metrics in the
laboratory information management system (LIMS).
C. PCR Amplification
1. Prepare PCR reaction mix according to the kit instructions,
including specific primers for the DICER1 gene.
2. Perform PCR in a thermocycler with cycling conditions
optimized for the primers.
D. Library Preparation for NGS
1. Purify PCR products using magnetic bead-based purification.
2. Quantify purified PCR products.
3. Prepare the sequencing libraries using the designated library
preparation kit.
4. Assess library quality and size distribution using Bioanalyzer or
TapeStation.
E. NGS Sequencing
1. Load the prepared libraries onto the NGS sequencer according
to the manufacturer’s protocol.
2. Monitor the sequencing run periodically to ensure optimal
performance.
F. Data Analysis
1. Transfer sequencing data to the bioinformatics pipeline for
analysis.
2. Align sequences to reference genome and call variants.
3. Annotate DICER1 variants using appropriate databases.
4. Filter and prioritize variants based on clinical significance.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include DNA extraction controls with each batch of samples.
• Include positive and negative controls in PCR and library
preparation steps.
• Monitor sequencing quality metrics (e.g., Q30 scores).
• Ensure thorough documentation of all procedures and any
deviations.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Review the sequencing data and variant calls.
2. Interpret the clinical significance of identified DICER1 variants.
3. Generate and review the final report.
4. Ensure the report is reviewed and signed by a qualified
molecular pathologist.
5. Release the report to the referring clinician via LIMS.
7. REFERENCE INTERVALS AND INTERPRETATION
• Interpretation should be in the context of the tumor type, patient’s
clinical presentation, and relevant literature.
• Reference ranges for variant pathogenicity as defined in the
ACMG guidelines.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• DNA quality and quantity from FFPE samples may be
compromised due to fixation and storage conditions.
• The presence of PCR inhibitors in the sample may affect
amplification efficiency.
• Not all regions of the DICER1 gene may be reliably covered;
regions with low coverage may need further validation.

preparation kits, and sequencer operation.
• ACMG guidelines for the interpretation of sequence variants.
• Internal departmental SOPs for NGS data handling and variant
interpretation.
By following this SOP, laboratory personnel will ensure the generation
of accurate and reliable results for DICER1 mutation analysis in
tumor specimens using next-generation sequencing. All staff
responsible for these procedures must be trained and competent in
the techniques and adhere strictly to the protocol outlined here.
