Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Digoxin, Serum
1. Purpose:
To ensure accurate and precise determination of digoxin levels in
serum samples by following standardized procedures for the
analytical phase.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of trained laboratory technologists to perform
the analysis, validate the results, and document according to the
defined protocol. Supervisors are responsible for validating the
procedures and ensuring adherence to the protocol.
1. Specimen Requirements and Stability:
Specimen Type:
• Preferred: Serum
• Collection: Blood collected in a red-top or serum separator tube
(SST).
• Volume: Minimum 0.5 mL of serum.
Specimen Stability:
• Room Temperature: 24 hours
• Refrigerated (2-8°C): 48 hours
• Frozen (-20°C): Up to 3 months
1. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies:
Equipment:
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes
• Analyzers capable of measuring digoxin levels (e.g.,
chemiluminescent immunoassay, ELISA, etc.)
Reagents:
• Digoxin calibrators and controls
• Digoxin-specific assay kits
Supplies:
• Pipette tips
• Sample cups/tubes
• Gloves
• Labels
1. Procedure:
Pre-Analytical Steps:
1. Ensure proper collection, labeling, and preparation of serum
samples.
2. Verify that samples meet the acceptable criteria:
◦ Properly labeled with patient’s name, date, and time of
collection.
◦ Samples are free from hemolysis and not clotted.
3. Allow refrigerated or frozen samples to come to room
temperature before analysis. Mix gently to ensure homogeneity.
Analytical Steps:
1. Calibrator and Control Preparation:
◦ Prepare calibrators and controls according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Run calibrators to establish a standard curve and to ensure
the analyzer is functioning correctly.
◦ Run quality control (QC) materials at the beginning, mid,
and end of each batch of tests. QC materials should include
at least two levels (low and high) of known digoxin
concentrations.
2. Sample Analysis:
◦ Place serum specimens, calibrators, and controls onto the
analyzer.
◦ Enter the required patient and sample information into the
analyzer.
◦ Initiate the digoxin assay according to the analyzer’s
operating instructions.
◦ Ensure that samples and reagents are loaded properly and
that the analyzer is primed and ready for analysis.
◦ The analyzer will automatically measure the digoxin
concentration in each sample.
3. Data Analysis and Interpretation:
◦ Check within-batch QC results to verify assay accuracy and
precision before reviewing patient results.
◦ Review the digoxin concentration results and ensure they
fall within the expected ranges.
◦ Any flagged results or results outside the linear range
should be rerun or verified by another method if necessary.
Post-Analytical Steps:
1. Reporting Results:
◦ Results must be reviewed, verified, and signed off by the
qualified analyst before being entered into the Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
◦ Ensure that critical values, if present, are communicated
immediately to the patient's healthcare provider as per
laboratory protocol.
2. Documentation:
◦ Record all steps of the process in the appropriate logbooks,
including dates, times, and initialing by the performing
technologist.
◦ Maintain records of all calibrations, QC results, and any
deviation from the standard protocol along with corrective
actions taken.
3. Quality Control:
QC Materials:
• Use commercial QC materials specific for digoxin.
• QC results should be within the established acceptable range
before patient results can be reported.
• In the event of QC failure, investigate and resolve the issue
before proceeding with patient sample analysis. Document all
steps taken to resolve QC issues.
1. References:
• Manufacturer’s instructions for the specific digoxin assay kit being
used.
• CLSI (Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute) guidelines for
therapeutic drug monitoring.
1. Method Limitations:
• Hemolysis, lipemia, or icterus may interfere with the test results.
• Cross-reactions with similar cardiac glycosides or other
medications may occur and should be reviewed when interpreting
results.
1. Safety Precautions:
• Follow standard laboratory safety protocols, including the use of
personal protective equipment (PPE).
• Dispose of all biological waste and sharps in accordance with
biohazard regulations.
Note: This SOP is subject to review and updates based on
technological advancements, updates in clinical practices, or
changes in regulatory guidelines. The latest review was conducted in
October 2023.
