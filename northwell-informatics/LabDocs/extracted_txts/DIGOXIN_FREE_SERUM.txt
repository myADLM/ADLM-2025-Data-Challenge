STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase for Generating Results for DIGOXIN, FREE,
SERUM
1. PURPOSE
This protocol outlines the analytical procedures, quality control, and
results reporting for the Free Digoxin assay in serum samples using
Chemiluminescent Microparticle Immunoassay (CMIA) for accurate
and reproducible results.
1. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel performing Digoxin,
Free, Serum analysis.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory technologists are trained and responsible for
performing this procedure and ensuring accurate reporting of results.
1. EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS
• Analyzer: Architect i2000SR (Abbott)
• Digoxin, Free, Reagent Kit (Abbott)
• Calibrators and Controls: Bio-Rad Liquichek Cardiac Markers
Level 1 and Level 2
• Pipettes and tips
• Centrifuge
• Specimen collection tubes (red top tube, no gel separator)
• Standard laboratory PPE
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred specimen: Serum (collected in a plain red-top tube)
• Volume: Minimum of 1 mL serum
• Storage: Serum should be separated from cells within 2 hours of
collection.
• Stability: Serum specimens are stable for 48 hours when
refrigerated at 2-8°C. For longer storage periods, freeze at -20°C.
Avoid multiple freeze-thaw cycles.
1. PROCEDURE
6.1. Sample Preparation
• Verify patient identification and specimen integrity.
• Centrifuge the blood sample at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes.
• Transfer serum to a clean, labelled polypropylene tube.
• Store refrigerated if analysis is not performed immediately.
6.2. Calibration
• Perform calibration at least once every 30 days or as mandated
by the instrument.
• Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for calibration using the
calibrators provided in the reagent kit.
• Document calibration data in the instrument's maintenance log.
6.3. Quality Control
• Pre-run daily quality control checks using Level 1 and Level 2
controls.
• Run controls at the beginning of each shift, after recalibration, and
following any maintenance procedures.
• Establish acceptable ranges for control checks according to the
manufacturer’s guidelines.
• Document all QC results in the Quality Control Log.
6.4. Analytical Procedure
• Load patient samples, calibrators, and controls into the
designated sample racks.
• Follow the analyzer’s operation manual for initiating a run:
◦ Select 'Digoxin, Free' assay from the menu.
◦ Load the required reagent cartridges as prompted by the
analyzer.
◦ Ensure the instrument barcode reader identifies all loaded
samples.
◦ Start the assay run.
6.5. Reporting Results
• Verify that calibrators and controls are within acceptable ranges.
• Review patient results on the instrument display.
• Confirm results with no flags or error codes.
• Transcribe or electronically transmit results to the Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
• Print results for manual verification and backup documentation if
required.
1. ACCEPTABLE RANGES
• Therapeutic range for Free Digoxin: 0.5 – 2.0 ng/mL
• Toxic range: >2.0 ng/mL
1. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
• Evaluate results in conjunction with clinical findings and other
laboratory data.
• Discuss any out-of-range results with attending clinical staff for
clinical correlation.
• Document critical results following laboratory protocols.
1. QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE
• Document all calibration, quality control results, and any
corrective actions taken.
• Maintain records of reagent lot numbers, expiration dates, and
any deviations or anomalies during the analytical process.
• Perform proficiency testing as part of continuous quality
assurance.
