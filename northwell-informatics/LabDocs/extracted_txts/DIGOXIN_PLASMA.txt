Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for DIGOXIN, PLASMA
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to ensure the accurate and reliable
measurement of Digoxin in plasma samples. This procedure outlines
the steps required for sample preparation, analysis, quality control,
and result reporting.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of designated laboratory staff to perform the
Digoxin plasma analysis following the procedures outlined below. All
staff members must ensure that quality control measures are
adhered to and that any deviations or issues are promptly reported to
the supervisor.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type: Plasma collected in a heparinized tube (green-top
tube) or Serum collected in a red-top tube.
Volume: Minimum 1 mL plasma or serum.
Stability:
• Plasma/Serum: Stable for up to 48 hours at 2-8°C.
• Frozen Plasma/Serum: Stable for up to 6 months at -20°C.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens with visible hemolysis.
• Specimens not properly labeled.
• Specimens collected in non-approved tubes (e.g., EDTA, sodium
citrate).
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Centrifuge
• Analytical Balance
• Digoxin assay kit (manufacturer-specific, e.g., Roche Elecsys
Digoxin Assay)
• Automated analyzer (e.g., Roche Cobas e601)
Reagents:
• Digoxin standards and controls
• Diluent and wash solutions as specified in the assay kit
• Calibration materials as specified in the assay kit
Supplies:
• Calibrated pipettes and tips
• Centrifuge tubes
• Disposable gloves
1. PROCEDURE
A) Sample Preparation:
1. Centrifuge the plasma sample at 1500g for 10 minutes at room
temperature to separate the plasma from cellular components.
2. Transfer the clear supernatant to a labeled aliquot tube.
3. If analysis cannot be performed immediately, store the aliquot at
2-8°C.
B) Calibration and Quality Control:
1. Prepare calibration standards and quality control materials
according to the assay kit instructions.
2. Run calibrations and verify that initial control values fall within
acceptable ranges before proceeding with sample analysis.
C) Sample Analysis:
1. Load the prepared plasma samples, calibration standards, and
quality control materials into the automated analyzer.
2. Initiate the Digoxin analysis program on the analyzer.
3. Ensure the analyzer operates without error codes; monitor the
process until completion.
4. After analysis, review the generated data for calibrator and
control values to ensure they are within acceptable limits.
D) Result Interpretation:
1. Verify that all controls are within acceptable ranges. If controls
are out of range, do not report patient results until issue is
resolved.
2. Review test results for any flags or errors reported by the
analyzer.
3. Validate the results using predefined acceptance criteria before
reporting.
E) Reporting Results:
1. Enter verified results into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
2. Review and approve results following site-specific guidelines
before releasing to patient records.
3. Ensure critical values are communicated according to the
repeat critical values guidelines.
REJECTION CRITERIA: Specimens that are visibly hemolyzed or not
collected in the appropriate tubes are to be rejected. The technologist
must document the reason for rejection and notify the appropriate
personnel.
QUALITY CONTROL:
• Perform quality control checks according to manufacturer's
guidelines with each assay run.
• Record all quality control results and any corrective actions taken
if results fall outside prescribed ranges.
REFERENCE INTERVAL: Therapeutic range for Digoxin: Typically
0.8-2.0 ng/mL. Verify specific reference values with assay kit
instructions or medical guidelines.
METHOD LIMITATIONS: Refer to the manufacturer’s assay kit insert
for detailed limitations regarding interferences and assay specificity.
DOCUMENTATION: Maintain records of all assay runs, including
calibration, quality control, and patient results in accordance with
laboratory protocols.
REFERENCES: Manufacturer’s assay kit insert for Digoxin.
