Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Measuring Digoxin in Serum
1. PURPOSE
The objective of this SOP is to ensure accurate and reliable
measurement of Digoxin levels in serum samples. This SOP provides
detailed procedures for processing and analyzing serum samples for
Digoxin using analytical instrumentation, as well as guidelines for
documentation, quality control, and reporting results.
Responsibility:
• The designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the
analysis, documenting procedures, and reporting results.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring staff compliance with the
SOP and addressing any deficiencies or corrective actions
required.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type:
• Preferred: Serum collected in a red-top (no additive) or serum
separator tube (SST).
Collection and Handling:
• Collect at least 5 mL of whole blood and allow it to clot at room
temperature.
• Centrifuge the sample for 10 minutes at 1000-2000 x g to obtain
serum.
• Transfer the serum to a clean, labeled tube.
Unacceptable Conditions:
• Grossly hemolyzed or lipemic samples.
• Samples collected in tubes containing anticoagulants other than
lithium heparin.
• Specimens not properly labeled or without collection date/time.
3. SPECIMEN STORAGE
• Store serum samples at 2-8°C if analysis cannot be performed
immediately.
• Serum samples remain stable for up to 48 hours at 2-8°C.
• For long-term storage, freeze serum samples at -20°C or below.
4. MATERIALS AND REAGENTS
Equipment:
• Centrifuge
• Approved chemistry analyzer with calibration for Digoxin
Reagents:
• Digoxin assay reagent kit
• Calibrators and controls (as provided by the manufacturer)
• Deionized or distilled water
Supplies:
• Pipettes and tips
• Test tubes or microfuge tubes
• Disposable gloves
• Timer
5. CALIBRATION AND CALIBRATOR PREPARATION
• Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for preparing and running
calibrators.
• Record details of reagent lot numbers, expiration dates,
calibration results, and any deviations in the calibration log.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Utilize at least two levels of QC material (low and high) during
each run.
• QC results should fall within the established acceptable range.
• Document QC results. If QC fails, do not report patient results and
verify the cause.
7. ANALYTICAL PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Warm all reagents to room temperature before use.
2. Ensure the chemistry analyzer is properly calibrated.
3. Verify that QC materials are within their expiration date.
Assay Procedure:
1. Load the appropriate volume of serum sample into the analyzer
(refer to the instrument manual for exact volume requirements).
2. Add reagents as per the instrument's instructions.
3. Initiate the assay run per the instrument’s operating procedures.
4. Review the quality control results and ensure they are within
acceptable limits before reporting patient results.
8. TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDELINES
• If QC results are out of range, recalibrate the system and re-run
QC.
• If recalibration fails to resolve the issue, review reagent
preparation, instrument maintenance logs, and user errors.
• Consult the supervisor or technical support if issues persist.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
• Review all patient results to ensure they are plausible (e.g., within
expected physiological ranges).
• Report results to the patient's electronic record system (LIS) only
after verifying the QC and ensuring data integrity.
• Critical values (i.e., Digoxin levels significantly above or below the
therapeutic range) must be flagged and communicated to the
appropriate clinical personnel as per the laboratory's critical
results policy.
10. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolysis, lipemia, and icterus may interfere with the Digoxin
assay.
• Follow manufacturer’s insert for detailed limitations.
11. DOCUMENTATION AND RECORD-KEEPING
• Maintain patient sample logs, QC logs, calibration logs, and
maintenance records.
• Ensure proper documentation of any procedural deviations or
corrective actions.
• Retain all records for the duration required by regulatory
guidelines.
