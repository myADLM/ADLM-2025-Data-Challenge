Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for DPYD Full Gene
Sequencing
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the analytical procedure for the
full gene sequencing of the dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase
(DPYD) gene to detect variants and mutations. The procedure will
ensure accurate and reliable results, maintaining compliance with
CLIA regulations.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the designated molecular technologist to
perform the sequencing and data analysis. The supervisor is
responsible for reviewing the generated results and ensuring the
procedure is followed accurately.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
3.1 Preferred Specimen:
• Whole blood collected in EDTA tubes (purple top).
• Minimum volume: 3 mL.
• Transport the specimen at 2-8°C.
3.2 Acceptable Specimen:
• Buccal swab in proper collection medium.
• Transport the specimen at 2-8°C.
3.3 Unacceptable Specimen:
• Specimens clotted or hemolyzed.
• Specimens collected in heparin tubes.
• Specimens subjected to extreme temperatures.

• Microcentrifuges.
• Vortex mixer.
• Qubit Fluorometer.
4.2 Reagents:
• DNA extraction kit.
• PCR master mix.
• Primers specific to DPYD exons.
• Sequencing buffer and reagents (compatible with the sequencer
used).
• Ethanol (70% and 100%).
4.3 Supplies:
• PCR tubes or plate.

1. PROCEDURE
5.1 DNA Extraction:
• Follow the instructions provided with the DNA extraction kit to
extract genomic DNA from the collected specimen.
• Quantify the isolated DNA using a Qubit Fluorometer.
• Record DNA concentration and purity.
5.2 PCR Amplification:
• Design primers to cover the entire coding region of the DPYD
gene.
• Prepare the PCR master mix according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
• Aliquot the master mix into PCR tubes or plate.
• Add the DNA template (50 ng/reaction) into each tube, making
sure all controls (positive, negative, and no template) are
included.
• Program the thermal cycler: Denaturation at 95°C for 30 seconds,
Annealing at specific temperature (determined by primer design)
for 30 seconds, and Extension at 72°C for 60 seconds, repeat for
35 cycles.
5.3 Purification and Quantification:
• Purify the PCR products using appropriate cleanup columns or
beads.
• Quantify the purified amplicons using the Qubit Fluorometer.
5.4 Sequencing Reaction:
• Set up the sequencing reaction using the manufacturer’s
recommended protocol for the sequencer in use (Sanger or
NGS).
• Denature the purified PCR product.
• Load the sequencing plate/tube onto the sequencer.
5.5 Data Analysis:
• Transfer the raw sequencing data to the bioinformatics system.
• Utilize software (e.g., BLAST, Clustal Omega) for alignment and
variant calling.
• Identify any variants based on reference gene sequences.
• Validate results with a secondary bioinformatics tool for accuracy.
5.6 Report Generation:
• Compile the identified variants and interpret the clinical relevance.
• Generate a comprehensive report including patient details,
results, interpretation, and comments on detected mutations.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
6.1 Positive Control:
• Run known DPYD variant samples to ensure PCR amplification
and sequencing efficiency.
6.2 Negative Control:
• Include samples with no template (water) to check for
contamination.
6.3 Validation:
• Perform inter-run validation for consistency in sequencing results.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
Results, including identified variants, will be reviewed and verified by
a senior technologist or supervisor before being released to the LIS.
Ensure that any critical findings are promptly communicated to the
ordering physician.
1. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS
• Follow standard laboratory biosafety guidelines.
• Handle all reagents and specimens with appropriate PPE.
• Dispose of all biological waste according to laboratory protocol.
1. REFERENCES
• CLIA guidelines for genetic testing.
• Manufacturer guidelines for DNA extraction and sequencing
reagents.
• Relevant peer-reviewed publications on DPYD gene sequencing
methods.
1. RECORD KEEPING
Maintain all records of DNA extraction, PCR, sequencing run, and
data analysis according to CLIA and laboratory policy for future
reference and audits.
This protocol ensures the accurate and efficient sequencing of the
DPYD gene for the genetic assessment of patients, aiding in the
diagnosis and management of conditions associated with
dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase deficiency.
