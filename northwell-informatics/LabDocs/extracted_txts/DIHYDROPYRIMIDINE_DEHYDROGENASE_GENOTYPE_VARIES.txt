Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Procedure for DIHYDROPYRIMIDINE
DEHYDROGENASE GENOTYPE, VARIES
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this procedure is to outline the steps
for analyzing the DIHYDROPYRIMIDINE DEHYDROGENASE
(DPYD) genotype, which varies depending on specific
mutations. This SOP ensures consistency, accuracy, and quality
in the testing process.
Responsibility: It is the responsibility of trained laboratory personnel
to perform the DPYD genotype analysis according to the procedure
outlined in this SOP. Staff are also responsible for identifying any
deficiencies that may affect the test results and reporting them to a
supervisor.
1. DEFINITION The DPYD genotype analysis involves identifying
specific genetic variations associated with dihydropyrimidine
dehydrogenase (DPD) enzyme deficiency.
2. PROCEDURE
A) Pre-Analytical Phase
• Verify the identity and integrity of the specimen.
• Ensure correct labeling and documentation accompanying the
specimen.
• Store the specimen under appropriate conditions until analysis.
B) Analytical Phase
1. DNA Extraction
• Extract genomic DNA from the specimen (e.g., blood, saliva)
using a validated extraction kit.
• Verify DNA purity and concentration using spectrophotometric
analysis (e.g., Nanodrop).
1. PCR Amplification
• Design and prepare primers specific to the DPYD gene regions
containing polymorphisms.
• Set up PCR reactions using a validated master mix and
conditions.
• Include positive and negative controls in the PCR setup.
1. Gel Electrophoresis (if applicable)
• Perform gel electrophoresis to confirm successful PCR
amplification.
• Visualize bands using a UV transilluminator.
1. Genotyping
• Perform genotyping using a validated methodology, such as: a)
Real-Time PCR with TaqMan probes b) Restriction Fragment
Length Polymorphism Analysis (RFLP) c) Sanger Sequencing d)
Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS)
1. Data Analysis
• Analyze the genotyping results using appropriate software.
• Compare results against reference sequences and known
mutation databases.
• Confirm the presence or absence of polymorphisms in the DPYD
gene.
1. Quality Control
• Run appropriate controls (positive, negative, blanks) alongside
the samples.
• Repeat testing for any inconclusive or ambiguous results.
• Document all QC activities in the laboratory log.
C) Post-Analytical Phase
1. Interpretation
• Interpret the genotype results in the context of clinical relevance.
• Correlate findings with potential DPD deficiency and impacts on
drug metabolism.
1. Reporting
• Report results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
following site-specific reporting guidelines.
• Include necessary comments regarding the genotype and any
potential clinical implications.
1. Data Storage
• Store raw data and analysis results in accordance with laboratory
protocols.
• Maintain backup copies of critical data.
1. Communication of Results
• Communicate critical results promptly to the requesting clinician.
• Document all communication activities.
1. Reference Intervals Refer to established reference intervals for
genotype interpretations relevant to DPYD mutation analysis.
2. Method Limitations Refer to specific genotyping method inserts
for limitations and troubleshooting guidelines.
3. REFERENCES
• Refer to manufacturer's instructions and validated protocols used
in the extraction, PCR, and genotyping processes.
• Clinical guidelines on DPYD genotyping and its implications.
1. QUALITY ASSURANCE
• Regularly review procedure and update as necessary based on
new evidence or technological advancements.
• Participate in external quality assurance programs for genotyping.
This protocol is effective October 2023 and will be reviewed
periodically for updates.
