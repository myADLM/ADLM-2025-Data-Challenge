DIHYDRORHODAMINE FLOW CYTOMETRIC N-FORMYL-
METHIONYL-LEUCYL-PHENYLALANINE TEST, BLOOD SOP
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for performing the Dihydrorhodamine (DHR)
Flow Cytometric N-Formyl-Methionyl-Leucyl-Phenylalanine (fMLP)
Test on blood samples.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing the
DHR Flow Cytometric fMLP Test according to this Standard
Operating Procedure (SOP).
3. DEFINITIONS
Dihydrorhodamine (DHR) Test: A flow cytometric test used to assess
the oxidative burst activity of neutrophils following stimulation with
fMLP.
N-Formyl-Methionyl-Leucyl-Phenylalanine (fMLP): A bacterial-derived
peptide used to stimulate neutrophils in this assay.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred Specimen:
• Whole blood collected in sodium heparin (green top) tubes.
• Sample volume: Minimum 2 mL.
Acceptable Specimen:
• Whole blood collected in EDTA (lavender top) tubes if sodium
heparin is unavailable.
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Clotted samples.
• Hemolyzed samples.
• Specimens older than 24 hours.
• Samples received without proper labeling and documentation.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Flow cytometer (equipped with a 488 nm laser).
• Polypropylene tubes.
• fMLP (N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine).
• Dihydrorhodamine 123 (DHR 123).
• Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4.
• Fetal bovine serum (FBS).
• Pipettes and tips.
• Vortex mixer.
• Centrifuge with swinging bucket rotor.
6. PROCEDURE
Sample Preparation:
1. Label necessary number of polypropylene tubes with patient
identifiers.
2. Aliquot 100 µL of whole blood into each labeled tube.
Reagent Preparation:
1. Prepare a working solution of DHR 123 (final concentration 5
μM) in PBS.
2. Prepare a working solution of fMLP (final concentration 1 μM) in
PBS.
Stimulation and Staining:
1. Add 100 µL of DHR 123 working solution to each tube of whole
blood. Vortex gently to mix.
2. Incubate the samples at 37°C for 15 minutes in a water bath
while protected from light.
3. After incubation, add 100 µL of fMLP working solution to each
tube. Vortex gently to mix.
4. Incubate the samples at 37°C for an additional 15 minutes in a
water bath while protected from light.
Stopping the Reaction:
1. Add 2 mL of cold PBS to each tube to stop the reaction.
2. Centrifuge the tubes at 300 x g for 5 minutes at 4°C.
3. Remove the supernatant carefully without disturbing the pellet.
Cell Washing:
1. Resuspend the cell pellet in 1 mL of cold PBS with 2% FBS.
2. Centrifuge the tubes at 300 x g for 5 minutes at 4°C.
3. Remove the supernatant carefully without disturbing the pellet.
4. Repeat the wash step two more times.
Flow Cytometry Analysis:
1. Resuspend the final cell pellet in 500 µL of cold PBS with 2%
FBS.
2. Perform flow cytometry analysis using a flow cytometer
equipped with a 488 nm laser.
3. Measure the fluorescence intensity of DHR 123 in the
appropriate channel (typically the FL1 channel).
7. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Run quality control samples (positive control and negative
control) with each batch of patient samples.
2. If the QC samples do not meet acceptance criteria,
troubleshoot the assay, and repeat the analysis.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Collect and analyze the data using appropriate flow cytometry
software.
2. Compare the patient's fluorescence intensity to the established
reference range to determine the presence or absence of an
oxidative burst.
3. Report the results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolyzed or clotted samples can affect the accuracy of the test.
• Samples older than 24 hours can result in reduced cell viability
and altered results.
