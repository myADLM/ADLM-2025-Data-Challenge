Standard Operating Procedure
Analytical Phase for DIHYDRORHODAMINE FLOW CYTOMETRIC
PHORBOL MYRISTATE ACETATE TEST, BLOOD
1. PURPOSE To outline the procedures for analyzing blood samples
using the Dihydrorhodamine (DHR) Flow Cytometric Phorbol
Myristate Acetate (PMA) test to assess the respiratory burst function
of neutrophils.
2. RESPONSIBILITY Designated laboratory personnel are
responsible for performing the analysis, ensuring quality control, and
verifying results according to this procedure. It is the responsibility of
all staff to identify issues in the test process and report any
inconsistencies or concerns to their supervisor.
3. SPECIMEN
• Preferred Specimen: 2-5 mL of fresh whole blood collected in
EDTA or heparinized tubes.
• Unacceptable Specimens: Specimens with visible clots,
hemolyzed samples, or specimens not collected in appropriate
anticoagulant tubes.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES:
• Flow Cytometer (configured for DHR123 dye).
• DHR123 (Dihydrorhodamine 123) dye.
• PMA (Phorbol Myristate Acetate) reagent.
• Phosphate-Buffered Saline (PBS).
• Lysis buffer.
• Sample tubes.
• Centrifuge.
• Vortex mixer.
• Personal protective equipment (PPE).
5. PROCEDURE:
5.1 Preparation
1. Prepare Reagents:
◦ Prepare DHR123 stock solution and working dilution
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Prepare PMA stock solution and working dilution.
2. QC Preparation:
◦ Run QC samples with known values before processing
patient samples to ensure the flow cytometer and reagents
are performing correctly. Record the QC results.
3. Equipment Check:
◦ Ensure the flow cytometer is calibrated and perform daily
maintenance checks according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
5.2 Sample Preparation
1. Add DHR123 to Samples:
◦ Aliquot 100 μL of whole blood into two separate tubes (one
for stimulation, one for control).
◦ Add 2 μL of diluted DHR123 dye to each tube. Incubate at
37°C for 15 minutes in the dark.
2. Stimulate with PMA:
◦ To the stimulation tube, add 2 μL of PMA solution. Incubate
both tubes at 37°C for another 15 minutes in the dark.
3. Lyse Red Blood Cells:
◦ Add 2 mL of lysis buffer to each tube, vortex gently, and
incubate at room temperature for 10 minutes.
◦ Centrifuge tubes at 300 x g for 5 minutes. Discard
supernatant.
4. Wash Cells:
◦ Resuspend the cell pellet in 2 mL PBS. Centrifuge at 300 x
g for 5 minutes. Discard supernatant.
◦ Repeat the wash step once more.
5. Resuspend Cells:
◦ Resuspend the final cell pellet in 500 μL PBS. Mix gently.
5.3 Flow Cytometry Analysis
1. Setup Instrument:
◦ Set up the flow cytometer according to the manufacturer's
instructions for detecting the DHR123 dye (typically using
the FITC channel).
2. Run Samples:
◦ Run the control (unstimulated) sample first, followed by the
stimulated sample.
◦ Acquire and analyze at least 10,000 gated neutrophil events
per tube.
3. Data Collection:
◦ Record the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) for both
control and stimulated samples.
◦ Calculate the stimulation index (SI) by dividing the MFI of
the stimulated sample by the MFI of the control sample.
6. RESULT INTERPRETATION
1. Acceptance Criteria:
◦ Ensure that the stimulation index falls within the established
reference range.
2. Quality Control:
◦ Verify that QC results are within acceptable limits before
reporting patient results. If QC fails, identify the issue,
resolve it, and rerun QC before proceeding with patient
samples.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Data Review:
◦ Review the flow cytometry data, including quality of the
neutrophil gating and MFI values.
2. Documentation:
◦ Document all results, including raw data prints from the flow
cytometer, in the laboratory information system (LIS).
3. Critical Results:
◦ In case of critical results (e.g., significantly reduced
respiratory burst activity), promptly notify the ordering
physician and document the communication.
8. QUALITY CONTROL AND TROUBLESHOOTING
1. Internal QC:
◦ Perform daily QC using control samples with known values.
Document and monitor trends in QC results to detect any
shifts or drifts in assay performance.
2. Daily Checks:
◦ Perform daily calibration and maintenance of the flow
cytometer as per manufacturer's instruction.
3. Troubleshooting:
◦ Review equipment logs and reagent performance if issues
arise.
◦ Consult the supervisor or technical support as required for
persistent issues.
