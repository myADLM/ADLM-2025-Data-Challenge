Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Dihydrorhodamine Flow
Cytometric Test, Blood
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedures
for performing the Dihydrorhodamine (DHR) Flow Cytometric Test,
blood. This guide details the analytical phase of generating results to
ensure accurate and reliable measurement of oxidative burst activity
in neutrophils.
2. SCOPE This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel involved in
performing DHR Flow Cytometry testing on blood specimens within a
CLIA-certified laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Laboratory Technologists are responsible for performing the test
as described.
• Laboratory Supervisors are responsible for reviewing and
verifying test results and ensuring all protocols are followed.
• Quality Control Staff are responsible for ensuring that all
equipment is calibrated and that quality control is maintained
throughout the testing process.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred Specimen: 3-4 mL of Peripheral whole blood collected
in a sodium heparin (green top) tube.
• Acceptable Specimen: EDTA (lavender top) anticoagulated blood.
• Specimen Storage: Sample must be received and processed
within 24 hours of collection and kept at room temperature
(20-26°C).
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Flow Cytometer (e.g., BD FACSCanto II)
• Dihydrorhodamine 123 (DHR 123) reagent
• Phorbol myristate acetate (PMA)
• ROS inhibitor (e.g., Diphenylene iodonium chloride)
• Tubes (e.g., Falcon Tubes, 5mL Polystyrene)
• Calibrated Pipettes and Tips
• Centrifuge
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
6. PROCEDURE
6.1 Preparation:
• Verify that all instruments are clean, properly calibrated, and that
flow cytometry settings are validated.
• Ensure reagents are prepared according to manufacturer
instructions and within their expiration dates.
• Wear appropriate PPE before handling and processing
specimens.
6.2 Sample Preparation:
• Label all tubes clearly with patient identification and pertinent
information.
• Add 100 µL of whole blood to three separate tubes.
• Prepare working solution of DHR 123 as per manufacturer’s
instructions.
6.3 Stimulation and Inhibition:
• Add 10 µL of DHR 123 to each of the tubes.
• To one tube (Test Sample), add 10 µL PMA (final concentration
200 nM).
• To the second tube (Negative Control), add 10 µL PBS without
PMA.
• To the third tube (Inhibition Control), add 10 µL of ROS inhibitor,
and incubate 5 minutes before adding 10 µL PMA.
• Incubate all tubes at 37°C for 30 minutes in a water bath or
incubator.
6.4 Analysis by Flow Cytometry:
• After incubation, lyse red blood cells in each tube using 1 mL lysis
buffer for 10 minutes at room temperature.
• Wash cells twice with PBS by centrifugation at 300x g for 5
minutes.
• Resuspend cells in 300 µL PBS.
• Analyze samples immediately on flow cytometer:
◦ Set up parameters to assess forward and side scatter
properties, gating on granulocytes.
◦ Measure fluorescence intensity of DHR 123 using the FITC
channel (488 nm excitation, 530 nm emission).
6.5 Data Acquisition and Analysis:
• Acquire at least 10,000 neutrophils per sample.
• Analyze the data using flow cytometry software (e.g., BD
FACSDiva or FlowJo).
• Calculate the Mean Fluorescence Intensity (MFI) for each sample.
• Compare the MFI of the stimulated sample (PMA) to the negative
control for qualitative assessment of the oxidative burst.
6.6 Quality Control:
• Run daily flow cytometry QC using standardized fluorescent
beads.
• Use an internal positive control blood sample and process it
similarly to ensure assay consistency.
• Record all QC results and take corrective actions if QC results are
outside of established ranges.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
• Review and verify data for accuracy, ensuring all controls pass
before result interpretation.
• Enter verified data into the laboratory information system (LIS).
• Abnormal results require a secondary review before final
reporting.
• Report results following standardized LIS reporting guidelines.
8. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Establish reference intervals based on historical laboratory data
or manufacturer's guidelines.
• Indicate findings as normal or abnormal based on these reference
intervals.
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Analyte stability is reduced if specimens are not processed within
24 hours.
• Interference from hematologic disorders may affect cell gating and
fluorescence interpretation.

This SOP is effective as of October 2023 and must be reviewed
annually by laboratory supervisors, or whenever significant
procedural modifications occur.
