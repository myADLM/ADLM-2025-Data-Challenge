Protocol for Analytical Phase: DIHYDROTESTOSTERONE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the measurement of
Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) in serum samples to ensure
accurate and reliable results.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for following this
procedure accurately and documenting the analytical process. It is
the responsibility of the supervising staff to ensure that the procedure
is followed correctly, and any discrepancies are addressed promptly.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred specimen: Serum collected in a red-top tube or serum
separator tube (SST).
• Unacceptable specimens: Specimens collected in plasma tubes
or specimens that are hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric.
1. REQUIRED EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• Centrifuge
• DIHYDROTESTOSTERONE Immunoassay kit (specific
manufacturer details to be included, e.g., ELISA kit)
• Microplate reader or relevant instrument for detection
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Calibrators and controls specific to DHT assay
• Deionized water
• Laboratory Timer
1. PROCEDURE
A) Specimen Preparation:
1. Centrifuge the collected blood at 1500-2000 g for 10 minutes to
separate serum.
2. Ensure serum is free of fibrin, RBCs, and other particulates.
Transfer serum into clean, labelled tubes.
3. Store serum specimens at 2-8°C if analysis is within 24 hours;
for longer storage, freeze at -20°C or lower.
B) Calibration and Quality Control:
1. Run calibrators according to the provided protocol in the
immunoassay kit package insert. Record calibration results.
2. Run quality control samples at different levels (low, medium,
high) to ensure the assay is working correctly.
3. Document the quality control results, ensuring they fall within
the acceptable range.
4. If QC results are out of range, troubleshoot according to the
manufacturer's guidelines before proceeding with patient
samples.
C) Assay Procedure:
1. Allow all reagents and samples to reach room temperature
(18-25°C) before use.
2. Follow the specific steps in the assay kit insert for preparing the
reagents and setting up the assay plates. a. Add standards,
controls, and patient samples to appropriate wells. b. Add the
required reagents/antibodies per the kit directions. c. Incubate
the plate as directed (usually 30-60 minutes). d. Wash the plate
thoroughly according to directions. e. Add substrate and
incubate for the specified time. f. Stop reaction using specified
stop solution. g. Read the plate using a microplate reader at the
specified wavelength.
3. Ensure that all manual intervention steps such as pipetting are
accurately performed to avoid contamination or error.
4. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results should be verified against known standards and controls.
• Document the reading from the microplate reader into the lab
information system (LIS).
• Review and interpret the results based on the standard curve
generated from the calibrators.
• Provide final patient results in the LIS and ensure they are within
accepted reference ranges. For DHT, reference intervals typically
range but should be confirmed with the kit instructions.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run QC samples at the start and end of each analytical batch.
• Maintain proper documentation including lot numbers, expiration
dates, calibration protocols, and QC results.
• Follow internal QC acceptance criteria to ensure validity of the
results.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If discrepancies arise, check for common issues such as improper
sample preparation, reagent issues, or instrumental faults.
• Re-run QC and patient samples as necessary. Document steps
taken to resolve issues.
• Consult the manufacturer's troubleshooting guidelines and involve
a supervisor if problems persist.
1. REFERENCES
• Include and adhere to specific references and guidelines provided
by the assay manufacturer.
• Ensure the latest version of the assay kit insert is available and
referred to.
