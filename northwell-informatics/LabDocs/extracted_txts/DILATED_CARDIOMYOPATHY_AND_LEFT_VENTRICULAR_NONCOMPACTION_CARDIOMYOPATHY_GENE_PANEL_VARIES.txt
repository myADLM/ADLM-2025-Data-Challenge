Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase of Generating Results for Dilated
Cardiomyopathy and Left Ventricular Noncompaction
Cardiomyopathy Gene Panel
1. Purpose
To provide standardized procedures for the analytical phase of
generating results for the Dilated Cardiomyopathy (DCM) and Left
Ventricular Noncompaction Cardiomyopathy (LVNC) Gene Panel.
This SOP ensures consistency, accuracy, and reliability in the testing
process.
Responsibility:
Designated molecular technologists are responsible for performing
the procedures as described in this protocol. Supervisors must
ensure that all tasks are completed and documented correctly.
1. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies
• PCR thermocycler
• DNA extraction kit
• NGS (Next-Generation Sequencing) platform
• NGS library preparation kit
• Reagent reservoirs
• Pipettes and sterile tips
• 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes
• Sterile water and buffer solutions
• Freezers and refrigerators for reagent storage
• Quality control materials
1. Specimen Requirements and Stability
• Acceptable specimens: Peripheral blood collected in EDTA tubes
• Minimum volume: 3 mL
• Specimen stability: Blood samples must be processed within 48
hours of collection. If immediate processing is not possible, store
samples at 2-8°C for up to 72 hours.
1. Procedure
A. DNA Isolation
1. Follow the DNA extraction kit manufacturer's instructions to
isolate genomic DNA from the blood sample.
2. Measure the concentration and purity of the isolated DNA using
a spectrophotometer (e.g., NanoDrop).
3. Adjust the DNA concentration to the required input amount for
the NGS library preparation.
B. Library Preparation
1. Follow the NGS library preparation kit instructions to prepare
DNA libraries from the extracted genomic DNA.
◦ Perform fragmentation
◦ End repair
◦ A-tailing
◦ Adaptor ligation
2. Purify the prepared libraries using magnetic beads and quantify
them using a fluorometer (e.g., Qubit).
C. PCR Amplification and Validation
1. Use multiplex PCR to amplify the target regions of the DCM
and LVNC genes as specified in the gene panel.
◦ Set up the PCR reaction mix with the appropriate primers
and reagents.
◦ Run the PCR thermocycler according to the optimized
program for the targeted amplification.
2. Validate the PCR products by running an agarose gel
electrophoresis to confirm successful amplification.
D. Next-Generation Sequencing
1. Pool the validated libraries and load them onto the NGS
platform according to the manufacturer's instructions.
2. Set up the sequencing run with the correct parameters and start
the run.
E. Data Analysis
1. Transfer the raw sequencing data files to the bioinformatics
pipeline for analysis.
2. Perform quality control checks on the sequencing data (e.g.,
read depth, coverage, and base quality).
3. Align the sequencing data to the reference genome and call
variants.
4. Annotate and filter the variants to identify potential pathogenic
mutations in the DCM and LVNC genes.
5. Use interpretive software to review the filtered variants for
clinical significance.
6. Quality Control
• Include positive and negative controls in each run to ensure the
reliability of the results.
• Regularly calibrate and maintain the equipment as per the
manufacturer's guidelines.
• Document all quality control activities including reagent lot
numbers, control results, and any corrective actions taken.
1. Reporting Results
• Refer to site-specific guidelines for formatting and reviewing
results before reporting.
• Verified results must be documented and reviewed by a
supervising technologist before releasing the final report.
• Follow the laboratory's policy for contacting the ordering physician
if critical results are identified.

and NGS platform usage.
• Clinical guidelines and literature on the genetic diagnosis of
Dilated Cardiomyopathy and Left Ventricular Noncompaction
Cardiomyopathy.

End of SOP
This protocol ensures precise and accurate generation of results for
the DCM and LVNC gene panel, contributing to the timely and
reliable diagnosis of individuals affected by these cardiomyopathies.
