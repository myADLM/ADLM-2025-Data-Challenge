STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP) FOR ANALYTICAL
PHASE OF GENERATING RESULTS FOR DILL, IGE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to provide standardized protocols for the
analytical phase in the processing and generating results for DILL
(Drug-Induced Liver Injury LFT Panel), IGE (Immunoglobulin E), and
serum tests in the laboratory. The aim is to ensure accurate, reliable,
and reproducible results.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
All designated laboratory personnel are responsible for following this
SOP to ensure proper results generation for DILL, IGE, and serum
tests. Supervisors must ensure the adherence of staff to the
procedures and validate the results accordingly.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
Equipment:
• Centrifuge
• Automated analyzer or immunoassay analyzer
• Pipettes and tips
• Refrigerators
• Freezers
• Water baths (if required)
• Heating blocks (if required)
• Incubators (if required)
Reagents:
• Calibrators and controls specific to DILL, IGE, and serum tests
• Standard buffers and solutions
• Assay-specific reagent kits
1. PROCEDURE
A) Specimen Preparation:
1. Ensure the specimen has been properly collected, received,
and accessioned.
2. Inspect specimens for proper labeling (patient ID, collection
date/time).
3. For stored specimens, confirm storage conditions are
appropriate (e.g., refrigerated or frozen as necessary).
B) Centrifugation:
1. Spin specimens using a centrifuge according to protocol:
◦ Centrifuge speed: 3000 RPM for 10 minutes.
2. Carefully aliquot the serum/plasma to avoid contamination.
C) Test Setup:
1. Prepare the automated analyzer or immunoassay analyzer
according to the manufacturer’s guidelines.
2. Load specimen aliquots into the analyzer.
3. Ensure calibrators and controls are prepared and run prior to
patient samples to validate the analytical run.
D) Analysis:
1. Run patient specimens on the analyzer.
2. Monitor the analyzer for proper function and troubleshoot any
errors as per manufacturer’s instructions.
3. Record any deviations or issues during the analysis.
E) Result Validation:
1. Verify the results generated by the analyzer.
2. Compare results with expected reference intervals or control
results.
3. Document any out-of-range results and follow up with retesting
if necessary.
4. Discuss any abnormalities with the supervisor immediately.
F) Quality Control:
1. Run quality control samples with each batch of patient
specimens to ensure accuracy.
2. Validate the results by comparing them to established QC
ranges.
3. Log QC results accordingly and take corrective measures for
any QC failures.
4. REPORTING RESULTS
5. Results transmission: Automatically transmit results to the
Laboratory Information System (LIS).
6. Review and verify results by a technologist before release.
7. Notify the healthcare provider promptly of any critical results.
8. Document all critical calls in the LIS as per the Repeat Critical
Values guidelines.
9. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Refer to site-specific reference intervals and guidelines for DILL, IGE,
and serum tests during result validation.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING AND LIMITATIONS
Refer to manufacturer’s insert or detailed procedural guidelines for
information on troubleshooting and method limitations.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s equipment manual and reagent inserts for DILL,
IGE, and serum tests.
• Site-specific analytical phase guidelines and reference interval
data.
1. DOCUMENTATION
Ensure all steps, deviations, QC measures, and corrective actions
are documented accurately in the instrument's log and LIS.
1. REVIEW AND UPDATES
This SOP will be reviewed bi-annually or whenever there are updates
from the manufacturer or changes in laboratory protocols.
