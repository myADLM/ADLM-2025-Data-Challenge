Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase Protocol for Generating Results for Diltiazem
(Cardizem, Dilacor)
Purpose: To ensure accurate and consistent results in the analytical
phase for the quantitative determination of Diltiazem in patient
specimens.
Scope: This protocol applies to all laboratory personnel performing
Diltiazem analysis in a CLIA-certified laboratory.
Responsibilities:
• Designated laboratory staff are responsible for conducting the
analysis according to this SOP.
• Supervisors are responsible for verifying that procedures are
followed correctly and addressing any deviations or issues that
arise during analysis.
Definitions: Diltiazem is a prescription medication used to treat
hypertension and angina. Accurate measurement is critical for
therapeutic drug monitoring.
Procedure:
1. Equipment and Supplies:
◦ High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) system
equipped with a UV detector.
◦ Analytical balance.
◦ Centrifuge.
◦ Vortex mixer.
◦ HPLC-grade solvents (Methanol, water, and acetonitrile).
◦ Diltiazem standard solution.
◦ Mobile phase preparation reagents.
◦ Sample collection tubes.
◦ Personal protective equipment (PPE), including gloves and
lab coats.
2. Reagents Preparation:
◦ Mobile Phase: Mix methanol and water in the ratio specified
in the HPLC method.
◦ Standard Solutions: Prepare a series of Diltiazem standard
solutions at varying concentrations to create a calibration
curve. Store the standards as recommended (e.g.,
refrigerated at 2-8°C).
3. Sample Collection and Preparation:
◦ Ensure patient specimens are collected and stored properly
according to the pre-analytical phase SOP.
◦ If samples are refrigerated, equilibrate to room temperature
before analysis.
◦ Aliquot samples as required and mix thoroughly using a
vortex mixer.
4. Calibration and Quality Controls:
◦ Calibrate the HPLC system using the Diltiazem standard
solutions.
◦ Run quality control samples with known Diltiazem
concentrations to verify proper calibration.
◦ Perform calibration and QC checks at the beginning of each
analytical run and after any maintenance or troubleshooting.
5. Sample Analysis:
◦ Load the prepared sample aliquots and Diltiazem standards
onto the HPLC system.
◦ Ensure proper method parameters are set, including flow
rate, detection wavelength, and runtime.
◦ Record and observe the chromatograms for each sample
and standard.
6. Data Interpretation:
◦ Compare the chromatograms of patient samples against the
calibration curve to determine Diltiazem concentration.
◦ Validate the peak integration and verify that it falls within the
standard retention time.
7. Result Reporting:
◦ Document results, including any recalibration or deviations
during the run.
◦ Transmit results to the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
for verification.
8. Quality Assurance and Troubleshooting:
◦ If any QC failures occur, halt the analysis, determine the
cause, and correct before proceeding.
◦ Re-run samples if necessary, and ensure discrepancies are
resolved. Notify the supervisor if issues persist.
9. Documentation:
◦ Ensure all results, calibrations, and QC checks are properly
documented.
◦ Maintain records of reagent lot numbers, expiration dates,
and any maintenance performed on the HPLC system.
References:
• Instrument manufacturer manuals and guidelines.
• Diltiazem product inserts and reference materials.
Review and Updates: This SOP will be reviewed annually and
updated as necessary to reflect changes in technology, regulations,
or laboratory practices.
