Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Title: DILUTE RUSSELL'S
VIPER VENOM TIME (DRVVT) CONFIRMATION, PLASMA
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedure for performing
the Dilute Russell's Viper Venom Time (DRVVT) confirmation test on
plasma samples. This assay is used to confirm the presence of lupus
anticoagulants (LA) detected during the DRVVT screening test.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all laboratory personnel performing the
DRVVT confirmation test to follow this SOP and ensure the accuracy
and reliability of test results.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type: Platelet-poor plasma. Collection Tubes: Sodium
citrate (3.2% or 3.8%) collection tubes.
Minimum Volume: 1 mL plasma. Stability: Plasma must be tested
within 4 hours of collection if kept at room temperature, or within 24
hours if refrigerated at 2-8°C.
Unacceptable Specimens: • Hemolyzed samples. • Specimens
collected in non-citrate anticoagulants. • Clotted specimens.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment: • Automated coagulation analyzer. • Centrifuge capable
of achieving 1500 x g to prepare platelet-poor plasma. • Timer. •
Pipettes and tips.
Reagents: • DRVVT reagent. • DRVVT confirmatory reagent
(contains phospholipids to correct for lupus anticoagulants). •
Calcium chloride solution (0.025 M). • Quality control materials.
Supplies: • Test tubes. • Microcentrifuge tubes. • Disposable gloves.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
Quality control must be performed with each batch of tests. Use both
normal and abnormal control plasmas. Ensure the quality control
results fall within established acceptable ranges before reporting
patient results.
1. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Prepare platelet-poor plasma by centrifuging whole blood at
1500 x g for 15 minutes. Carefully transfer the top two-thirds of
the plasma layer to a new tube, avoiding the buffy coat.
2. If plasma cannot be tested immediately, store at 2-8°C and test
within 24 hours.
Testing:
1. Allow all reagents and samples to reach room temperature
before use.
2. Prepare the coagulation analyzer and load it with appropriate
reagents and samples according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
3. Perform the DRVVT screen on the plasma sample using the
DRVVT reagent. Record the clotting time.
4. In a separate test reaction, perform the DRVVT confirmation on
the same plasma sample using the DRVVT confirmatory
reagent that contains excess phospholipids. Record the clotting
time.
5. Calculate the confirmatory ratio: Confirmatory ratio = (DRVVT
confirm clotting time) / (DRVVT screen clotting time)
Result Interpretation: • A confirmatory ratio of less than 1.2 indicates
an absence of lupus anticoagulants. • A confirmatory ratio of 1.2 or
greater may indicate the presence of lupus anticoagulants.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
2. Review and verify all results for quality control and patient
samples.
3. Report results in the laboratory information system (LIS) with
the following information:
◦ DRVVT screen clotting time.
◦ DRVVT confirm clotting time.
◦ Confirmatory ratio.
4. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the manufacturer's reagent insert for specific limitations of
the DRVVT test.
1. RECORD KEEPING
Maintain all quality control records, instrument calibration logs, and
test results as per laboratory policy and regulatory requirements.
