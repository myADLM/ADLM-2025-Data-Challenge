STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP) FOR DILUTE
RUSSELL'S VIPER VENOM TIME (DRVVT) CONFIRMATION
RATIO, PLASMA
1. PURPOSE To outline the procedure for the analytical phase of
generating results for Dilute Russell's Viper Venom Time (DRVVT)
confirmation ratio in plasma samples. The DRVVT confirmation ratio
assay is used to detect lupus anticoagulants by comparing clotting
times in the presence and absence of a phospholipid-rich
environment.
2. SCOPE This procedure applies to laboratory technologists
performing the DRVVT confirmation ratio assay and reporting results
in CLIA-certified laboratories.
3. RESPONSIBILITY Designated laboratory personnel are
responsible for performing the DRVVT confirmation ratio assay as
outlined in this SOP, troubleshooting any discrepancies or issues,
and accurately reporting the results.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Plasma from citrated blood
• Volume: Minimum of 1 mL plasma
• Collection Device: Citrated vacutainer tube (blue top)
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• DRVVT screening reagent
• DRVVT confirmation reagent
• Coagulation analyzer with DRVVT capability
• Calibrated pipettes and tips
• Storage: Reagents must be stored as per manufacturer’s
instructions.
6. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Verify specimen integrity and proper labeling (e.g., patient ID,
collection date/time).
2. Centrifuge citrated blood samples at 1500-2000 g for 10 - 15
minutes at room temperature to obtain platelet-poor plasma
(PPP).
Assay Setup:
1. Prepare the DRVVT screening and confirmation assays
according to the manufacturer's instructions.
2. Ensure that the coagulation analyzer is properly calibrated and
quality controls are within acceptable limits.
Testing:
1. Perform initial DRVVT screening assay: a. Pipette specified
volume of DRVVT screening reagent into a reaction cuvette. b.
Add specified volume of PPP to the cuvette containing
screening reagent. c. Mix gently and load into the coagulation
analyzer. d. Record time to clot (in seconds).
2. Perform DRVVT confirmation assay: a. Pipette specified
volume of DRVVT confirmation reagent into a reaction cuvette.
b. Add specified volume of PPP to the cuvette containing
confirmation reagent. c. Mix gently and load into the
coagulation analyzer. d. Record time to clot (in seconds).
Calculation of DRVVT Confirmation Ratio:
1. Calculate the DRVVT confirmation ratio using the formula: [
\text{DRVVT Confirmation Ratio} = \frac{\text{DRVVT Screening
Time}}{\text{DRVVT Confirmation Time}} ]
◦ Interpretation:
▪ If the confirmation ratio is ≥1.20, it indicates the
presence of lupus anticoagulants.
▪ If the confirmation ratio is <1.20, it indicates the absence
of lupus anticoagulants.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run internal positive and negative control plasma samples with
each batch of patient samples.
• Document control results and verify they fall within the
predetermined acceptable ranges.
• If controls are out of range, troubleshoot and repeat the assay.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Document DRVVT confirmation ratio results in the laboratory
information system (LIS).
• Review and verify results before releasing to clinician.
• Ensure critical values are communicated promptly according to
lab policy.
9. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Normal DRVVT confirmation ratio: <1.20
• Abnormal DRVVT confirmation ratio: ≥1.20
10. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples may interfere with clot
detection.
• Incorrect specimen handling may lead to erroneous results.
