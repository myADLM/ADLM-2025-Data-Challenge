Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Dilute Russell's Viper Venom Time
(DRVVT) Interpretation
1. PURPOSE
This SOP details the procedure for generating, analyzing, and
reporting Dilute Russell's Viper Venom Time (DRVVT) test results in
the laboratory. The DRVVT test is utilized for the detection of lupus
anticoagulants in patient plasma.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel involved in the
performance and interpretation of DRVVT.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the laboratory technologists to perform the
DRVVT test according to these guidelines and to correctly interpret
and document the results.
4. DEFINITION
Dilute Russell's Viper Venom Time (DRVVT): A coagulation test
designed to detect lupus anticoagulants (LA), autoantibodies that
interfere with the phospholipid-dependent steps of the coagulation
cascade.
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Citrated plasma.
• Collection: Blood should be collected in 3.2% sodium citrate
tubes.
• Processing:
◦ Centrifuge at 1500 x g for 15 minutes to obtain platelet-poor
plasma.
◦ Aliquot the plasma into suitable plastic tubes.
◦ Store at -20°C if not analyzed within 4 hours.
• Unacceptable Specimens: Hemolysed, lipemic, or clotted
samples.
6. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Coagulation analyzer capable of performing DRVVT tests.
• DRVVT reagent kits, including:
◦ DRVVT screening reagent.
◦ DRVVT confirmatory reagent.
• Calibrated pipettes.
• Quality control material for coagulation tests.
• Plasma preparation tubes.
• Timer.
7. PROCEDURE
7.1. Quality Control
• Perform quality control checks as per the manufacturer’s
instructions at the beginning of each shift or with every new
reagent lot.
• Document QC results in the log.
7.2. Preparation
1. Warm reagents to room temperature.
2. Calibrate the coagulation analyzer if not previously done.
7.3. Sample Testing
1. Ensure patient specimen is thawed to room temperature if
previously frozen.
2. Mix the sample gently before analysis.
DRVVT Screening Test
1. Pipette the specified volume of DRVVT screening reagent into
the test well of the analyzer.
2. Add the required volume of patient plasma to the reagent.
3. Start the timer according to the analyzer’s instructions.
4. Record the clotting time.
DRVVT Confirmatory Test
1. Repeat steps listed under DRVVT Screening Test, using the
DRVVT confirmatory reagent in place of the screening reagent.
2. Record the clotting time.
7.4. Calculation and Interpretation
• Normalized Ratio Calculation: [ \text{Ratio} =
\frac{\text{Screening Time}}{\text{Confirmatory Time}} ]
• Interpretation:
◦ A normalized ratio greater than 1.2 usually indicates the
presence of lupus anticoagulants.
7.5. Reporting Results
1. Verify and document results in the laboratory information
system (LIS).
2. If results are critical, follow the laboratory's protocol for
reporting critical values.
8. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If QC fails, do not proceed with patient samples. Re-evaluate the
reagents, analyzer, and QC materials.
• Re-run any sample that yields a normalized ratio inconsistent with
clinical presentation or other laboratory findings.
