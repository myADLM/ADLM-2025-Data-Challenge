1. PURPOSE
To standardize the analytical procedure for generating results for
Dilute Russell's Viper Venom Time (DRVVT) Mix, Plasma to ensure
accuracy and consistency in test result reporting.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel performing DRVVT
Mix tests in the Coagulation Laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the laboratory staff to perform the DRVVT
Mix test according to this SOP and to bring any procedural
discrepancies or abnormalities in test results to the attention of the
supervisor.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
- Preferred Specimen: Platelet Poor Plasma (PPP)
- Collection: Draw blood into a 3.2% sodium citrate tube.
Ensure proper mixing of the blood with anticoagulant by gentle inversion.
- Processing: Centrifuge the sample at 1500 g for 15 minutes to obtain PPP.
- Storage: If testing cannot be performed immediately, store platelet-poor plasma at -20°C or colder.
- Transport: Transport the frozen plasma on dry ice to avoid thawing. Do not store at 2-8°C for longer than 4 hours.
5. MATERIALS & EQUIPMENT
- DRVVT Reagent
- DRVVT Mix Reagent
- Incubation Equipment
- Automated Coagulation Analyzer or Manual Coagulation equipment
- Sodium citrate anticoagulated plasma
- Calibrated Pipettes
- Timer
- Quality Control Plasma
6. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Allow all reagents and samples to come to room temperature
before use.
2. Thoroughly mix all reagents by gentle inversion or using a roller
mixer.
3. Prepare quality control materials at the same time as patient
samples.
Testing:
1. Preparation of Test Mixture: a. Prepare the DRVVT screening
reagent by adding an appropriate volume of the reagent to the
corresponding volume of TRIS-Buffered Saline (TBS) or other
specified diluent as recommended by the manufacturer. b. Mix
equal volumes of patient plasma and normal pooled plasma
(NPP). The final mix should consist of 1 part patient plasma and
1 part normal pooled plasma. Use exactly the same volumes of
each.
2. Incubation and Initiation: a. Incubate the test mixture at 37°C
for 5 minutes. b. Add the appropriate volume of DRVVT reagent
to the plasma mixture and start the timer immediately.
3. Clot Detection: a. If using an automated analyzer, load the
sample into the analyzer, and follow the manufacturer’s
instructions to analyze for clot formation time. b. For manual
methods, observe the mixture for clot formation visually or
using a mechanical clot detection method, and record the
clotting time.
4. Control & Calibration: a. Run at least two levels of quality
control samples (normal and abnormal) with each batch of
patient samples. Verify that the control values fall within the
established range. b. Perform calibration as per manufacturer
guidelines if any drift in standard time values is observed.
7. CALCULATIONS & INTERPRETATION
1. Calculate the Ratio:
Patient DRVVT Mix Clotting Time / Normal Pooled
Plasma Clotting Time
2. Interpretation of Results: a. Compare the ratio to established
reference intervals. b. An elevated DRVVT ratio suggests the
presence of Lupus Anticoagulants. Confirm with additional tests
if necessary.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
- Use commercially available quality control materials. Ensure they cover the clinically relevant range.
- Document all QC results, and review them for trends or shifts.
9. REPORTING
- Report the DRVVT ratio and the interpretation of the result.
- Include comments indicating if additional confirmatory tests are suggested.
10. LIMITATIONS
- Hemolysis, lipemia, and icterus may interfere with test results.
- Inaccurate ratios may result from improper sample handling or failure to maintain reagents at the proper temperature.
