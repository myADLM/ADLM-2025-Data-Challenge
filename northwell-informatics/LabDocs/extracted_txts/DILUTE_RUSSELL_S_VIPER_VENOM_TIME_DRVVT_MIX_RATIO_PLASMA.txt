Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Analytical Phase for
Generating Results for Dilute Russell's Viper Venom Time (DRVVT)
Mix Ratio, Plasma
1. PURPOSE
To provide clear and detailed procedures for performing the DRVVT
Mix Ratio test, which is used to screen for lupus anticoagulant (LA) in
plasma samples. This SOP will ensure consistent and accurate
results in accordance with laboratory standards.
Responsibility:
Designated staff trained in performing coagulation assays are
responsible for conducting the test, ensuring proper documentation,
and performing corrective actions if necessary. Supervisors are
responsible for ensuring compliance with SOP procedures and
managing any deficiencies.
1. DEFINITION
DRVVT Mix Ratio, Plasma - a coagulation assay for detecting lupus
anticoagulant by comparing the clotting time of plasma mixed with
Russell's Viper Venom to the clotting time of control plasma.
1. PROCEDURE
A) Specimen Requirements and Stability:
• Preferred specimen: Citrate plasma
• Plasma should be double-centrifuged to remove platelets
(<10,000/mL).
• Specimen should be stored at 2-8°C for up to 4 hours or frozen at
-20°C or lower for longer storage.
• Specimen must be thawed rapidly and gently mixed prior to
analysis.
B) Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies:
• Automated coagulation analyzer or manual method (e.g.,
stopwatch and tilt tube technique)
• DRVVT reagent with phospholipids and RVV enzyme
• Normal control plasma
• Calcium chloride solution
• Disposable plastic tubes
• Pipettes and tips
• Platelet-poor plasma (PPP)
C) Quality Control:
• Use two levels of control plasma: Normal and LA-positive control.
• Run controls at the beginning of each batch and every 40
samples thereafter.
• Document control results and take corrective actions if controls
are out of range.
D) Testing Procedure:
1. Thaw frozen citrated plasma specimens rapidly in a water bath
at 37°C.
2. Mix gently by inversion; avoid vigorous shaking.
3. Prewarm reagents and necessary components to 37°C.
4. Perform the DRVVT screen:
i. Pipette the plasma sample (e.g., 100 μL) into a prewarmed
plastic tube. ii. Add DRVVT reagent (e.g., 100 μL) and mix
gently. iii. Incubate at 37°C for specified time (e.g., 2 minutes).
iv. Add prewarmed calcium chloride solution (e.g., 100 μL) to
trigger clotting. v. Record the clotting time using automated
analyzer or stopwatch.
5. Perform DRVVT Mix:
i. Prepare the mixture – add patient plasma and normal control
plasma in a 1:1 ratio. ii. Pipette the mixed plasma (e.g., 100 μL)
into a prewarmed tube. iii. Add DRVVT reagent (e.g., 100 μL)
and mix gently. iv. Incubate at 37°C for specified time (e.g., 2
minutes). v. Add prewarmed calcium chloride solution (e.g., 100
μL) to trigger clotting. vi. Record the clotting time.
E) Calculations:
• Calculate the ratio of clotting times: DRVVT Mix Ratio = (Clotting
time of patient plasma / Clotting time of control plasma)
• Interpret results according to established reference ranges and
criteria for lupus anticoagulant.
F) Reporting Results:
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
promptly.
• Verify and review results for accuracy before result release.
• Report critical values immediately to the clinician per the
laboratory's critical value policy.
G) Method Limitations:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric specimens may interfere with
clotting time determination.
• Proper specimen handling and storage are crucial to avoid false
results.
