Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Dilute Russell's Viper
Venom Time (DRVVT), Plasma
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedure for accurately
performing and generating results for the Dilute Russell's Viper
Venom Time (DRVVT) assay in plasma specimens. DRVVT is used
for detecting lupus anticoagulants, which are associated with
increased risk of thrombosis.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
a. Preferred/acceptable: - Plasma collected in 3.2% sodium citrate
(light blue top tube). - After collection, samples should be centrifuged
at 1500 x g for 15 minutes to obtain platelet-poor plasma. - If testing
is not performed immediately, plasma should be aliquoted and stored
frozen at -20°C and can be stable for up to 3 months.
b. Unacceptable: - Specimens collected in tubes other than 3.2%
sodium citrate. - Specimens with evidence of hemolysis. - Samples
arriving in the laboratory greater than 4 hours post-collection if not
frozen.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Stopwatch or timer
• Automated coagulation analyzer
• DRVVT kit and controls
• Calibrated pipettes
• Platelet-poor plasma (PPP)
• Appropriate quality control reagents
• Micropipettes and tips
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
Ensure calibration and maintenance logs of equipment are up-to-
date.
1. PROCEDURE
a. Pre-analysis:
• Review patient requisition and specimen for acceptability.
• Allow frozen plasma samples to thaw completely at room
temperature (approximately 30 minutes).
• Mix thawed plasma thoroughly by gentle inversion.
b. Setup:
• Prepare reagents and controls according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
• Ensure the automated coagulation analyzer is calibrated and
perform necessary quality control checks as outlined in the
internal QC procedure.
c. Testing: 1. Add the required volume of platelet-poor plasma to the
reaction cup of the analyzer (ensure it matches the volume specified
in the kit insert). 2. Add dilute Russell's viper venom reagent to the
plasma as per kit instructions. 3. Allow the reaction to occur for the
time specified by the manufacturer. 4. Record the clotting time in
seconds. 5. Perform a confirmatory test if initial DRVVT is prolonged
or per laboratory protocol.
d. Post-analysis: - Compare patient's clotting time to reference
intervals provided in the kit insert and interpret accordingly. - If
controls are out of range, troubleshoot and repeat testing.
e. Quality Control: - Run positive and negative controls with each
batch of patient specimens. - Record control results and ensure they
meet acceptable ranges before validating patient results.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
a. Verification:
• Review each result for accuracy and consistency with controls.
• Document results in the laboratory information system (LIS).
b. Reference Intervals:
• Report DRVVT results in seconds.
• Normal reference interval and interpretive comments should be
based on kit insert and validated laboratory-specific requirements.
c. Critical Results:
• Notify the ordering physician or designated contact for any critical
values detected during testing.
1. QUALITY CONTROL AND MAINTENANCE
a. Internal Quality Control: - Perform bi-weekly quality control checks
using known control samples. - Monthly correlations between
laboratory analyzers to ensure consistency. - Record all QC and
maintenance activities as per laboratory protocol.
b. Calibration: - Conduct annual calibration of pipettes and analyzers
by certified personnel. - Validate new reagent lots with correlation
studies before use.
c. Corrective Actions: - Document any deviations from protocols and
corrective actions taken. - Consult with supervisory staff when
necessary.
1. LIMITATIONS AND TROUBLESHOOTING
Refer to the manufacturer’s DRVVT kit insert for detailed limitations
of the assay and troubleshooting steps for any aberrant results.
If repeated issues arise, consult with technical support and perform
additional validations.
