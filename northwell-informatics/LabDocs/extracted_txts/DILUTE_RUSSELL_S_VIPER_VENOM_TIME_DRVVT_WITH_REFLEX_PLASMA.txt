Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Dilute Russell's Viper
Venom Time (DRVVT), With Reflex, Plasma
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to perform the Dilute Russell's Viper
Venom Time (DRVVT) test for the detection of lupus anticoagulant in
plasma samples. This test is vital for the diagnosis and management
of autoimmune conditions. When certain predetermined results are
obtained, reflex tests will be carried out to confirm or further
investigate the initial findings.
Responsibility: It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory
personnel to perform DRVVT testing and reflex testing as needed, to
document all processes, and to report results accurately.
1. DEFINITIONS
DRVVT: A test designed to identify the presence of lupus
anticoagulants by measuring the clotting time in a sample of plasma
with a reagent containing Russell's Viper Venom, which activates
factor X directly. Lupus Anticoagulant: An autoimmune inhibitor that
interferes with phospholipid-dependant tests.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND HANDLING
Preferred Specimen:
• Freshly collected venous blood sample in a 3.2% sodium citrate
tube (light blue top).
• Ensure that the blood-to-anticoagulant ratio is correct (9:1).
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Samples that are clotted, hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric.
• Underfilled or overfilled tubes.
• Specimens received 4 hours post-collection without being
centrifuged and separated.
Specimen Handling:
• Centrifuge the sample at 1500x g for 15 minutes within 4 hours of
collection to separate plasma.
• Carefully remove the plasma without disturbing the buffy coat and
transfer to a clean tube.
• Store the plasma at 2-8°C if the test is to be performed within 4
hours or freeze at -20°C for longer storage.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Coagulation analyzer with appropriate software for DRVVT
testing.
• DRVVT reagent and control kits (e.g., Diagnostica Stago).
• Pipettes and tips.
• Plasma thawing system.
• Centrifuge.
• Timer.
• Quality control materials (positive and negative controls for lupus
anticoagulant).
1. PROCEDURE
A. Initial DRVVT Test:
1. Thaw frozen plasma samples at 37°C if required.
2. Ensure all reagents and controls are at room temperature.
3. Mix all reagents well before use.
4. Program the coagulation analyzer with the DRVVT test
protocol.
5. Load patient samples, controls, and reagents onto the analyzer.
6. Follow analyzer-specific instructions to perform the test.
7. Document test start time and end time.
B. Interpretation of Initial DRVVT Results:
1. If the initial DRVVT result is within the reference range, report
as "Negative for Lupus Anticoagulant."
2. If the initial DRVVT result is prolonged, proceed with the reflex
test.
C. Reflex Testing:
1. Perform a confirmatory DRVVT test with a high concentration of
phospholipid reagent to neutralize the lupus anticoagulant
effect.
2. Run the confirmatory test on the same analyzer following the
analyzer-specific protocol.
3. Document the initial and confirmatory DRVVT results.
D. Interpretation of Reflex Test Results:
1. If the DRVVT result corrects to within the reference range with
the confirmatory test, report as "Positive for Lupus
Anticoagulant."
2. If the DRVVT result remains prolonged, additional testing for
inhibitors or factor deficiencies may be required.
3. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run positive and negative controls with each batch of patient
tests.
• Ensure quality control results are within the acceptable range
before reporting patient results.
• Document control outcomes daily, and take corrective action if
controls are out of range.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Enter the results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Flag abnormal and critical values as per laboratory protocols.
• Results must be reviewed and verified by the responsible
technologist.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• DRVVT: negative for lupus anticoagulant.
• Confirmatory DRVVT: correction or no correction in clotting time.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Improper sample collection, handling, and storage can affect
DRVVT results.
• Factor inhibitors and deficiencies may interfere with test
interpretation.
1. REFERENCES
• Diagnostica Stago product inserts for DRVVT reagents.
• CLSI guidelines and standards for coagulation testing in clinical
laboratories.
1. DOCUMENT CONTROL
• Review SOP annually or as needed for updates.
• Keep a log of any amendments made to the procedure and
protocols.
By adhering to this SOP, the laboratory ensures consistent and
accurate testing for DRVVT, contributing to the reliable diagnosis and
management of patients with suspected lupus anticoagulant.
