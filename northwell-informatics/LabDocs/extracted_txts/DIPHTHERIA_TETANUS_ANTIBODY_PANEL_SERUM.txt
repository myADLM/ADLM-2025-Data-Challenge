DIPHTHERIA/TETANUS ANTIBODY PANEL, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for the analysis of serum samples for the
determination of Diphtheria and Tetanus antibodies using an enzyme-
linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). This assay is used to verify
immunization status or diagnose potential exposure to the pathogens
associated with Diphtheria and Tetanus.
Responsibility: All staff members performing this test are
responsible for understanding and following this protocol to ensure
consistency, reliability, and accuracy of results. It is the responsibility
of the laboratory supervisor to ensure that all relevant staff are
trained in this protocol and competency assessed.
1. DEFINITION
Diphtheria/Tetanus antibody panel: An analytical test that measures
the specific antibodies (IgG) against toxoids of Corynebacterium
diphtheriae and Clostridium tetani in human serum.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENT
Specimen Type: Serum Minimum Volume: 0.5 mL Collection/
Handling:
• Collect blood samples using aseptic techniques in serum
separator tubes (SST).
• Allow the blood to clot by leaving it undisturbed at room
temperature for 30-60 minutes.
• Centrifuge the sample at 1500x g for 10 minutes and carefully
separate the serum.
• Label the serum aliquot with the patient’s details and store at
2-8°C if the analysis is to be carried out within 48 hours. For
longer storage, freeze the serum at -20°C or lower.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
Equipment:
• ELISA microplate reader capable of measuring optical density at
450 nm
• Micropipettes and tips
• Wash bottle or automated plate washer
• Multichannel pipette
• Incubator set to 37°C
Reagents:
• ELISA kit for Diphtheria/Tetanus Antibody Testing, which includes:
◦ Microtiter plates pre-coated with Diphtheria and Tetanus
antigens
◦ Positive and negative controls
◦ Calibrators
◦ Conjugate reagent
◦ Substrate solution (TMB)
◦ Stop solution
◦ Wash buffer
◦ Sample diluent
Storage and Stability:
• All reagents should be stored according to manufacturer’s
instructions.
• Do not use reagents past their expiration dates.
1. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
• Ensure all reagents and samples are at room temperature before
starting the assay.
• Prepare the wash buffer according to the kit instructions.
Assay Procedure:
1. Pipette 100 µL of standards, controls, and diluted samples
(1:100 in sample diluent) into the appropriate wells of the
microtiter plate.
2. Incubate the plate at 37°C for 45 minutes.
3. Aspirate the contents of the wells and wash each well three
times with 300 µL of wash buffer. Tap the plate on absorbent
paper to remove any remaining liquid.
4. Add 100 µL of the conjugate reagent to each well.
5. Incubate the plate at 37°C for 30 minutes.
6. Repeat the washing step (step 3).
7. Add 100 µL of the TMB substrate solution to each well.
Incubate the plate at room temperature (20-25°C) in the dark
for 15 minutes.
8. Add 100 µL of stop solution to each well to terminate the
reaction. Gently tap the plate to ensure thorough mixing.
9. Measure the absorbance of each well at 450 nm using the
ELISA plate reader within 30 minutes of stopping the reaction.
10. CALCULATION OF RESULTS
• Construct a standard curve by plotting the mean absorbance
values of the standards against their corresponding
concentrations.
• Determine the antibody concentration of the samples by
interpolation from the standard curve.
• Ensure to use proper software or calculations as instructed by the
ELISA kit manufacturer.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Ensure to run both positive and negative controls as well as
calibrators with each assay batch.
• Review control values to confirm they are within the acceptable
range provided by the manufacturer before reporting patient
results.
• Re-run the assay if control values are not within the specified
range.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Transmit the results electronically to the Laboratory Information
System (LIS) after review and verification.
• Report units in International Units per milliliter (IU/mL) as per the
manufacturer's instructions.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Non-immune: <0.1 IU/mL
• Borderline: 0.1 - 0.5 IU/mL
• Immune: > 0.5 IU/mL
1. LIMITATIONS
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples may affect the result
accuracy.
• Antibody levels may vary due to individual variability in immune
response; repeat testing may be required.

• Follow the manufacturer’s insert for detailed instructions regarding
ELISA Kits.
• Standard laboratory guidelines for quality control and result
verification must be adhered to.
