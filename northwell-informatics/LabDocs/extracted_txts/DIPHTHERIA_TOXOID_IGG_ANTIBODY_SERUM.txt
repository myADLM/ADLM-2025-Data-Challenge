SOP for the Analytical Phase of Generating Results for
DIPHTHERIA TOXOID IgG ANTIBODY, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is to
delineate the process for the analytical phase of generating results
for Diphtheria Toxoid IgG Antibody, Serum. This procedure ensures
accuracy, reliability, and timely reporting of test results.
Responsibility: Designated staff are responsible for performing the
test analysis according to this SOP. It is the responsibility of all
laboratory personnel to ensure adherence to the procedure and to
report any deviations or issues to their supervisor.
1. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all instances where Diphtheria Toxoid IgG
Antibody testing is performed in the laboratory.
1. DEFINITION
Diphtheria Toxoid IgG Antibody, Serum is a specific test to measure
the level of IgG antibodies against diphtheria toxin in a patient's
serum, indicating immunity status or response to vaccination.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation
1. Acceptable samples include serum collected in SST or red-top
tubes.
2. Unacceptable samples include hemolyzed specimens, lipemic
specimens, or specimens containing particulate matter. Follow
rejection criteria.
3. Upon arrival, inspect the sample for any signs of rejection
criteria and document any issues.
B. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies
1. ELISA kit for Diphtheria Toxoid IgG Antibody
2. Microplate reader capable of reading at 450 nm with reference
at 620-650 nm
3. Micropipettes and tips
4. Multi-channel pipette (optional)
5. Plate washer (recommended)
6. Incubator set at optimal temperature (typically 37°C)
7. Calibration and controls: Positive and negative controls as
provided by the kit manufacturer
C. Testing Procedure
1. Verify the presence of all necessary reagents and supplies
before beginning the test.
2. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for preparing reagents
and samples. Allow any refrigerated samples to come to room
temperature.
3. Pipette the required volume of controls, standards, and patient
samples into wells of the microplate.
4. Add antigen and/or antibody solutions as per kit instructions to
the appropriate wells.
5. Incubate the plate at 37°C for the time specified in the protocol.
6. Wash the plate with an appropriate washing buffer solution,
following exact wash cycles as indicated in the kit's insert.
7. Add substrate solution and incubate for the specified time to
allow for color development.
8. Stop the reaction by adding the stop solution as directed.
9. Read the plate on a microplate reader at 450 nm with reference
ranging 620-650 nm.
D. Result Calculation
1. Obtain absorbance values for each well.
2. Generate a standard curve based on the provided calibrators.
3. Calculate patient sample concentrations of Diphtheria Toxoid
IgG Antibodies using software or manual methods.
4. Reference the positive and negative control results to validate
assay accuracy.
E. Quality Control
1. Include positive and negative controls in each run to ensure
assay validity.
2. Perform quality controls with every new kit lot number and
reagent.
3. Document and review control results for consistency and
conformity to established ranges.
4. Any deviations or out-of-specification results must be
investigated, documented, and reported to a supervisor
immediately.
F. Reporting Results
1. Transfer results to the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
ensuring all data is reviewed and verified by the technologist.
2. Report final results to the requesting physician and document
result communication as per laboratory protocol.
G. Limitations
1. Refer to the ELISA kit insert for limitations pertaining to specific
reagent pads, interference substances, and any other
procedural caveats.
2. Investigate any unexpected or abnormal results as per
troubleshooting guidelines provided in the kit insert.

1. DOCUMENTATION
All steps involved in the analytical phase, from sample preparation to
result reporting, must be documented accurately. This includes any
corrective actions or troubleshooting measures taken.
This SOP will ensure knowledgeable and efficient processing,
maintaining the standards required for accurate and reliable
Diphtheria Toxoid IgG Antibody testing in serum samples.
