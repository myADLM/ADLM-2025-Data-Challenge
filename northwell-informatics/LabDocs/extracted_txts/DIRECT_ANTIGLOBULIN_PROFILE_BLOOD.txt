Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) –
Direct Antiglobulin Profile, Blood
1. PURPOSE
This procedure outlines the steps for conducting and documenting
the Direct Antiglobulin Test (DAT) for blood samples in the laboratory.
The DAT is performed to detect antibodies or complement proteins
attached to the surface of red blood cells, which can indicate
hemolytic anemia, transfusion reactions, and autoimmune disorders.
Responsibility:
• It is the responsibility of designated staff to perform the DAT
according to the defined procedure.
• All staff must adhere to this SOP and report any issues affecting
test accuracy or results to a supervisor.
2. DEFINITION
The Direct Antiglobulin Test (DAT) involves detecting antibodies
bound to red blood cells and is critical in diagnosing immune-
mediated hemolytic conditions.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: EDTA-anticoagulated whole blood is the
preferred specimen type for DAT.
• Volume: Minimum of 2 ml of EDTA blood.
• Stability: Specimens should be kept at 2-8°C and tested within
48 hours of collection. If specimens are refrigerated, allow them to
reach room temperature before analysis.
• Unacceptable Specimens:
◦ Specimens collected in non-EDTA tubes.
◦ Clotted specimens.
◦ Samples with significant hemolysis.
4. PROCEDURE
Preparatory Steps
• Ensure all reagents and equipment are within their expiration
dates and calibrated.
• Verify the identity of the specimen against the requisition form.
Document any discrepancies.
Materials and Equipment:
• Anti-human globulin reagent (AHG)
• Wash buffer (normal saline)
• DAT-positive and DAT-negative control red cells
• Centrifuge
• Test tubes and pipettes
Direct Antiglobulin Test (DAT) Procedure:
1. Preparation of Red Cells:
◦ Label test tubes appropriately for each patient's sample.
◦ Add 1 drop of patient EDTA-anticoagulated blood to each
labeled tube.
2. Washing Red Cells:
◦ Add 2 ml of normal saline to each tube and mix well.
◦ Centrifuge at 3000 rpm for 1 minute.
◦ Remove supernatant and repeat the washing steps at least
three times to minimize unbound antibodies and proteins.
3. Adding AHG Reagent:
◦ After the final wash, discard the supernatant leaving the
packed red cells.
◦ Add 2 drops of AHG reagent to each test tube and gently
mix.
◦ Incubate the tubes at room temperature for 5 minutes.
4. Centrifugation:
◦ Centrifuge the tubes at 3000 rpm for 1 minute.
5. Reading Results:
◦ Gently re-suspend the red cells and observe for
agglutination.
◦ Grade and record the strength of agglutination (negative,
weak, 1+, 2+, 3+, 4+).
◦ A positive result indicates the presence of bound antibodies
or complement proteins.
6. Quality Control:
◦ Run DAT-positive and DAT-negative control red cells
concurrently to validate the procedure.
◦ Document control results ensuring they are within
acceptable ranges.
5. REPORTING RESULTS
• Enter results into the LIS, including the reaction grade.
• Any positive results must be reviewed and verified by the
supervising technologist.
• Critical results should be communicated to the ordering physician
immediately following laboratory policy.
6. QUALITY CONTROL AND TROUBLESHOOTING
• Daily Controls:
◦ Run positive and negative controls daily and record results.
◦ Controls must give expected outcomes (positive and negative
for their respective controls).
• Troubleshooting:
◦ If controls fail, do not proceed with testing patient samples.
◦ Investigate reagent integrity, equipment calibration, and
procedural errors.
◦ Notify the supervisor and repeat test once issues are resolved.

• Manufacturer's instructions for Anti-human globulin reagent.
• Laboratory internal quality control guidelines.
• Relevant clinical literature and standards for DAT.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• DAT results can be affected by the quality and handling of the
specimen.
• DAT may have limitations in detecting low-affinity antibodies, and
results should be interpreted in conjunction with clinical findings.
9. RECORD KEEPING
• Document all test results, controls, and corrective actions.
• Maintain records as required by laboratory regulatory standards.
10. REVISION HISTORY
• Document any changes made to this SOP with date and rationale.
Note: This SOP should be authorized and reviewed regularly by the
laboratory supervisor and adjusted according to new guidelines or
improvements in the testing methods.
