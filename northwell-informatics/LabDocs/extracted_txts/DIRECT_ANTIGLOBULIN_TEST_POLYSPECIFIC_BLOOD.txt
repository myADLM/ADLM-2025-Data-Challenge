Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Direct
Antiglobulin Test (Polyspecific), Blood
1. PURPOSE
The Direct Antiglobulin Test (DAT) is designed to detect the presence
of antibodies or complement proteins attached to the surface of red
blood cells (RBCs). This procedure aims to provide instructions for
performing the DAT (Polyspecific) test, ensuring accurate and reliable
results in the detection of autoimmune hemolytic anemia, hemolytic
disease of the newborn, and other conditions leading to hemolysis.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
All laboratory personnel performing the DAT are responsible for
understanding and adhering to this SOP. It is the responsibility of the
laboratory supervisors to ensure that staff are trained and competent
to perform the procedure.
3. DEFINITION
Direct Antiglobulin Test (DAT): A laboratory test used to detect
antibodies or complement proteins bound to the surface of red blood
cells in vivo.
4. PROCEDURE
Specimen Requirements:
• Specimen Type: EDTA-anticoagulated whole blood
• Specimen Stability: Stored at 2-8°C if not tested within 24 hours.
Test specimen within 48 hours of collection.
Reagents and Supplies:
• Polyspecific Antihuman Globulin (AHG) reagent
• Isotonic saline (0.9% NaCl) solution
• Positive and negative control cells
• Test tubes (12 x 75 mm)
• Test tube rack
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Wash bottles
• Agglutination viewer or microscope
Quality Control:
• Run a positive and negative control with each batch of tests.
• QC materials: Commercially available monoclonal antibody-
coated RBCs for positive control; uncoated RBCs for negative
control.
• Frequency: Daily, with each batch of patient samples, and upon
opening new reagent lots.
• Acceptable range: Positive control shows clear agglutination, and
negative control has no agglutination.
Testing Procedure:
1. Labeling:
◦ Label test tubes appropriately with patient identification and
control labels.
2. Cell Washing:
◦ Dispense 1 drop of the patient’s EDTA-anticoagulated whole
blood into a labeled test tube.
◦ Add 2-3 mL of isotonic saline to the tube.
◦ Centrifuge the tube at 500-1000 x g for 1 minute.
◦ Carefully decant or aspirate the supernatant without
disturbing the cell button.
◦ Repeat the washing process 3 times to ensure thorough
washing of the red blood cells.
3. Addition of AHG Reagent:
◦ After the final wash, decant the supernatant completely,
leaving a dry cell button.
◦ Add 2 drops of polyspecific AHG reagent to the washed red
blood cells.
◦ Mix gently by tapping the tube.
4. Centrifugation:
◦ Centrifuge the tube at 500-1000 x g for 15 seconds.
5. Reading the Results:
◦ Immediately after centrifugation, gently resuspend the cell
button by tapping the tube and examine for agglutination
using an agglutination viewer or microscope.
◦ Grade the reaction strength (e.g., negative, 1+, 2+, 3+, 4+).
6. Control Check:
◦ Ensure positive control shows distinct agglutination and
negative control shows no agglutination.
◦ Any deviation in control results invalidates the test and
requires investigation before proceeding.
5. REPORTING RESULTS
• Positive DAT: Report as positive, indicating the presence of
antibodies or complement on the red blood cells.
• Negative DAT: Report as negative, indicating the absence of
detectable antibodies or complement on the red blood cells.
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS),
ensuring all results are reviewed and verified by a qualified
technologist.
6. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
• Positive DAT indicates immune-mediated hemolysis (e.g.,
autoimmune hemolytic anemia, hemolytic disease of the newborn,
transfusion reactions).
• Negative DAT does not rule out hemolysis but suggests non-
immune causes.
7. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• False positives may occur due to improper washing of cells, over-
centrifugation, or contamination.
• False negatives may result from inadequate reagent volume,
improper cell washing, or low levels of antibodies.
