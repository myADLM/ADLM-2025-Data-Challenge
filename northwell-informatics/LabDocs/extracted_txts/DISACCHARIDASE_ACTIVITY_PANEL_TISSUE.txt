Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Disaccharidase Activity
Panel, Tissue
1. PURPOSE
To describe the procedure for the analysis of disaccharidase activity
in tissue samples, ensuring accurate and reliable measurement of
enzyme activities. This SOP includes steps to prepare the sample,
perform the analysis, calculate the results, and perform quality
control measures.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of laboratory personnel to follow this SOP to
ensure proper and consistent processing of disaccharidase activity
tests.
2. DEFINITIONS
Disaccharidases: Enzymes that catalyze the hydrolysis of
disaccharides into monosaccharides. The primary disaccharidases of
interest are lactase, sucrase, maltase, and palatinase.
3. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
• Microplate reader capable of measuring absorbance at 540 nm
• Calibrated pipettes and tips (10 µL - 1000 µL)
• Homogenizer
• Centrifuge
• Microcentrifuge tubes
• Test tubes
• Ice Bath
4. REAGENTS
• Substrate solutions (lactose, sucrose, maltose, and palatinose)
• Glucose standard solutions
• Buffer solutions (e.g., phosphate buffer, pH 7.4)
• Tris-HCl buffer (0.1 M, pH 6.0)
• pH 6.0 Reaction Buffer
• Glucose oxidase reagent kit
• Stop Solution
5. SPECIMEN HANDLING
Specimens: Fresh frozen intestinal tissue
Acceptance Criteria:
• Tissue samples homogenized in an ice-cold buffer
• Properly labeled with patient identification
• Delivered promptly to ensure enzyme activity preservation
6. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation:
1. Homogenization:
◦ Weigh approximately 100 mg of frozen tissue.
◦ Homogenize tissue in 1 mL of ice-cold phosphate buffer
using a homogenizer.
◦ Centrifuge the homogenate at 10,000 x g for 15 minutes at
4°C.
◦ Collect the supernatant and keep on ice.
B. Assay Setup:
1. Reaction Mixture Preparation:
◦ Prepare substrate solutions (2% w/v) in reaction buffer.
◦ In separate wells of a 96-well plate, add 100 µL of substrate
solution.
◦ Add 20 µL of tissue supernatant to each well.
◦ Incubate the plate at 37°C for 1 hour.
2. Stop the Reaction:
◦ Add 100 µL of Stop Solution (e.g., sulfuric acid) to each well
to stop the reaction.
3. Glucose Measurement:
◦ Add 200 µL of glucose oxidase reagent kit to each well.
◦ Incubate at room temperature for 10 minutes until the color
develops.
◦ Measure the absorbance at 540 nm using the microplate
reader.
C. Calculations: - Generate a standard curve using glucose
standards (ranging 0-200 µmol/L). - Determine the glucose
concentration in samples from the standard curve. - Calculate
enzyme activity as follows:
Enzyme Activity (U/mg protein) = (Glucose concentration (µmol/L) x reaction volume (mL)) / (time (min) x protein concentration in supernatant (mg/mL))
7. QUALITY CONTROL
A. Quality Control Measures: - Run quality control samples (known
concentrations) with each batch. - Ensure all reagents and equipment
are within calibration and expiration dates. - Perform assays in
duplicate to assess reproducibility.
B. Acceptable Limits: - The glucose standard curve must have an
R² value > 0.98. - Quality control samples must fall within ±10% of
the expected value.
C. Corrective Actions: - If the QC fails, rerun the assay with fresh
reagents or equipment calibration. - Document and report deviations
to a supervisor.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Record the results in the laboratory information system (LIS).
• Include the enzyme activities for lactase, sucrase, maltase, and
palatinase.
• Verify results for accuracy before releasing them to the healthcare
provider.
9. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions for the glucose oxidase reagent kit.
• Relevant literature on disaccharidase activity assays.
10. DOCUMENTATION
Maintain records of all results, quality control data, calibration logs,
and corrective actions for at least five years for auditing and review
purposes.
By following this SOP, laboratory personnel can ensure the accurate
and reliable measurement of disaccharidase activity in tissue
samples.
