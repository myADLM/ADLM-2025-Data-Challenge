Title: Protocol for the Analytical Phase of Generating Results for
Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation/Intravascular Coagulation
and Fibrinolysis (DIC/ICF) Profile Interpretation
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this protocol is to ensure that accurate and reliable
results for the DIC/ICF profile are generated and interpreted in a
consistent manner. This protocol outlines the steps involved in the
analytical phase, from specimen processing to result interpretation.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of designated staff to follow this protocol to
ensure the accurate generation and interpretation of DIC/ICF profile
results. Supervisors are responsible for ensuring that staff are
appropriately trained and for verifying the final results.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/Acceptable Specimens:
• 4.5 mL venous blood collected in a light blue top tube (sodium
citrate). The tube must be completely filled to ensure proper
blood-to-anticoagulant ratio.
• Specimens must be sent to the laboratory immediately after
collection and maintained at room temperature (18-25°C).
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens collected in incorrect anticoagulants or not completely
filled.
• Specimens received more than 4 hours after collection.
• Specimens exhibiting signs of clotting or hemolysis.
1. PROCEDURE
A) Specimen Processing:
1. Receive and document the specimen in the laboratory
information system (LIS).
2. Centrifuge the specimen at 1500-2000 x g for 10-15 minutes to
separate plasma.
3. Carefully transfer the plasma into a labeled aliquot tube without
disturbing the buffy coat layer.
4. Perform immediate analysis or store plasma at -20°C until
analysis.
B) Analytical Testing: The DIC/ICF profile typically includes the
following tests:
1. Prothrombin Time (PT)
2. Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT)
3. Fibrinogen
4. D-Dimer
5. Platelet count
Detailed procedures for each test should be followed according to the
instrument manufacturer’s instructions and validated laboratory
protocols:
1. Prothrombin Time (PT): a. Mix plasma with thromboplastin
reagent. b. Measure clot formation time.
2. Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT): a. Mix plasma
with partial thromboplastin reagent and calcium. b. Measure
clot formation time.
3. Fibrinogen: a. Quantitative measurement using clotting or
immunoassay methods.
4. D-Dimer: a. Quantitative measurement using immunological
techniques.
5. Platelet Count: a. Perform platelet count using automated
hematology analyzer.
C) Quality Control:
1. Run appropriate quality control material with each batch of
specimens.
2. Verify instrument calibration and maintenance logs.
3. Document all quality control results and take corrective actions
if control results are out of acceptable range.
4. RESULT INTERPRETATION
A) Criteria for Interpretation: The following parameters should be
considered when interpreting DIC/ICF profile results:
• PT: Prolonged PT may indicate coagulation factor deficiency or
consumption.
• aPTT: Prolonged aPTT may indicate coagulation factor deficiency
or presence of inhibitors.
• Fibrinogen: Low levels suggest consumption of fibrinogen.
• D-Dimer: Elevated levels indicate increased fibrinolysis and
presence of fibrin degradation products.
• Platelet Count: Decreased platelet count may indicate platelet
consumption.
B) Integration of Results:
1. Compare observed results against reference ranges provided
by the manufacturer and validated laboratory standards.
2. Integrate results from all tests to form a comprehensive profile
indicating the likelihood and extent of DIC/ICF.
C) Reporting Results:
1. Enter results into LIS for review by designated staff.
2. Verify results by cross-checking with quality control and
calibrations.
3. Provide interpretation comments based on integrated results
and clinical correlation.
4. Document critical values and inform the attending physician or
clinician immediately.
