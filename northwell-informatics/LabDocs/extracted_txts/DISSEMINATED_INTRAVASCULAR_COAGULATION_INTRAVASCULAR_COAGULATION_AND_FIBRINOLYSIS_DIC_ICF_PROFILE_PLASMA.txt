Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation/
Intravascular Coagulation and Fibrinolysis (DIC/ICF) Profile,
Plasma
1. PURPOSE
This procedure aims to provide detailed instructions on analyzing
plasma specimens for the DIC/ICF profile to ensure timely, accurate,
and reliable results. The profile typically includes assays for
fibrinogen, D-dimer, prothrombin time (PT), activated partial
thromboplastin time (aPTT), and platelet count.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all designated personnel performing DIC/ICF
profile analysis in the laboratory. It covers handling and processing
patient plasma samples, maintaining equipment, performing the
assays, and quality control.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
Laboratory personnel are responsible for:
• Following this SOP to process and analyze specimens for the
DIC/ICF profile.
• Reporting and documenting any unusual findings to a supervisor.
• Ensuring that quality control (QC) measures are followed
according to the lab's QC policy.
4. SPECIMEN COLLECTION AND HANDLING
Specimen Type:
• Plasma collected in sodium citrate tubes (3.2% or 3.8%).
Specimen Collection:
• Collect the blood specimen via venipuncture.
• Fill the sodium citrate tube to the indicated fill line to ensure the
proper blood-to-anticoagulant ratio.
• Invert the tube gently 3-5 times to mix.
Specimen Handling:
• Transport the specimen to the laboratory immediately.
• Centrifuge the specimen at 1500-2000 x g for 15 minutes to
obtain plasma.
• Aliquot plasma into a labeled secondary tube if immediate testing
is not feasible, and freeze at -20°C or lower until analysis.
• Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• Coagulation analyzer (e.g., ACL TOP, Siemens BCS XP)
• Fibrinogen, D-dimer, PT, and aPTT kits/reagents
• Calibrators and controls specific to the tests
• Timer
• Normal saline
• Platelet counting equipment (automated hematology analyzer)
• Standard laboratory supplies: pipettes, tips, centrifuge, sample
tubes
6. PROCEDURE
Pre-analytical Phase:
1. Verify specimen identification and integrity.
2. Check specimens for clotting, hemolysis, or improper labeling;
reject unsuitable specimens per laboratory policy.
3. Thaw frozen samples promptly at 37°C for 5 minutes if
required.
Analytical Phase:
A. Fibrinogen:
1. Prepare reagents and calibrators as per the manufacturer's
instructions.
2. Load the sample aliquots, calibrators, and controls into the
coagulation analyzer.
3. Run the test according to the manufacturer's protocol.
4. Record the fibrinogen concentration value in mg/dL.
B. D-dimer:
1. Prepare necessary reagents and calibrators.
2. Load the samples into the analyzer.
3. Run the D-dimer assay as per the manufacturer's instructions.
4. Record the D-dimer concentration in ng/mL.
C. Prothrombin Time (PT):
1. Reconstitute and prepare reagents.
2. Load plasma samples, PT reagent, calibrators, and controls into
the analyzer.
3. Conduct the PT test; the analyzer should calculate and display
results in seconds and as International Normalized Ratio (INR).
D. Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT):
1. Prepare aPTT reagents and calibrators.
2. Load plasma samples and reagents into the analyzer.
3. Run the aPTT assay according to the manufacturer's protocol
and obtain the clotting time in seconds.
E. Platelet Count:
1. Using an automated hematology analyzer, run the plasma
sample to determine platelet count.
2. Verify results and ensure they fall within the linearity range.
Post-Analytical Phase:
1. Review all test results for accuracy and completeness.
2. Validate the results by comparing QC data.
3. Report results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
4. Notify the clinician of any critical values immediately.
7. QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE
1. Perform QC tests at the beginning of each shift, with each new
lot of reagents, and after instrument maintenance.
2. Use multiple levels of control materials daily.
3. Document all QC results and actions taken for out-of-range
controls in the QC log.
4. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions and lab’s QC policy
strictly.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Ensure that all results are reviewed and verified by a qualified
technologist.
• Report results in the LIS with appropriate reference ranges and
critical values clearly indicated.
• Document and communicate critical results to the appropriate
clinical personnel, and ensure follow-up is recorded.
9. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Fibrinogen: 200-450 mg/dL
• D-dimer: <500 ng/mL
• PT: 11-13.5 seconds; INR: 0.8-1.2
• aPTT: 25-35 seconds
• Platelet Count: 150-400 x 10^3/μL
10. TROUBLESHOOTING
• Refer to specific instrument and reagent manuals for
troubleshooting.
• Document and address any errors or deviations from the SOP
immediately.
• Notify the supervisor for persistent issues.
11. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS
• Follow standard precautions and lab safety protocols at all times.
• Handle all specimens as potentially infectious.
• Dispose of biohazard waste properly.
