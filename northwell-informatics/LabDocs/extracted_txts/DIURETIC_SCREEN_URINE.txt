Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Diuretic Screen, Urine
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized method for the analysis and generation of
results for a diuretic screen in urine samples using approved
analytical techniques in a CLIA-certified laboratory, ensuring
accuracy, reliability, and consistency of results.
1. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all personnel involved in the analytical
phase of the diuretic screen in urine samples.
1. DEFINITIONS
Diuretic Screen: A laboratory test used to detect the presence and
quantify the levels of diuretics in urine samples.
1. RESPONSIBILITIES
Laboratory technologists are responsible for performing the analysis
according to this SOP. The supervisor is responsible for ensuring the
protocol is followed and troubleshooting as necessary. 5. SPECIMEN
REQUIREMENTS
Preferred Specimen: 20 mL of urine collected in a clean, sterile
container. Samples should be stored at 2-8°C and analyzed within 24
hours of collection. Unacceptable Specimen: Samples with
insufficient volume, samples stored at inappropriate temperatures,
and samples collected more than 24 hours before analysis. 6.
REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) or Gas
Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) system with a suitable
column. Certified reference standards for common diuretics (e.g.,
furosemide, hydrochlorothiazide, bumetanide, etc.). Reagent-grade
solvents (e.g., methanol, acetonitrile, water). Urine specimen
containers. 7. PROCEDURE
a) Specimen Preparation
Label the urine sample with the patient's identification and accession
number. If the sample has been refrigerated, bring it to room
temperature before analysis. Mix the urine sample thoroughly to
ensure homogeneity. b) Sample Extraction
Aliquot 5 mL of the urine sample into a clean, labeled centrifuge tube.
Add 5 mL of extraction solvent (e.g., methanol) and vortex the
mixture for 30 seconds. Centrifuge the tube at 3,000 rpm for 10
minutes to separate the phases. Transfer the supernatant to a clean,
labeled vial for analysis. c) Calibration and Quality Control
Prepare calibration standards for each target diuretic at various
concentrations using certified reference standards. Run calibration
standards and quality control samples at the beginning, during, and
end of the analytical run to ensure accuracy and precision. Compare
the results of quality control samples to established control limits. If
results fall outside control limits, troubleshoot and repeat the
analysis. d) Instrument Setup and Analysis
Set up the HPLC or GC-MS system according to the manufacturer's
instructions. Inject an appropriate volume (e.g., 10 µL) of the
extracted sample into the system. Set the chromatographic
conditions (e.g., column temperature, flow rate) and the detector
settings (e.g., wavelength or ionization mode) based on the target
analytes and reference method. Run the samples, ensuring that
calibration standards and quality control samples are included in the
sequence. e) Data Analysis and Reporting
Analyze the chromatograms generated by the HPLC or GC-MS
system using appropriate software. Identify the diuretics based on
their retention times and mass spectra compared to the reference
standards. Quantify the levels of diuretics in the urine sample using
the calibration curve generated from the calibration standards.
Review and verify the results. If the results are outside the expected
range or if there are any anomalies, reanalyze the sample and/or
troubleshoot the system. Document the results in the laboratory's
information management system (LIS). f) Reporting Results
Generate a report that includes the patient's identification, specimen
accession number, the detected diuretics, their concentrations, and
any relevant comments. Send the report to the requesting physician
or clinician via the approved communication channels. 8. QUALITY
CONTROL
Perform internal quality control checks using known control materials
at the start of the analytical run and periodically throughout.
Participate in external quality assurance programs to ensure ongoing
accuracy and proficiency. Document all quality control activities and
corrective actions in the laboratory's quality control log.
