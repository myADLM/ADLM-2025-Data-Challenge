Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
DMD Gene (Full Gene Analysis)
1. Purpose To outline the protocol for performing full gene analysis
for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) in a CLIA-certified
laboratory. This SOP provides detailed instructions for generating
accurate and reliable results for DMD gene analysis.
2. Scope This SOP applies to the procedures involved in the
analytical phase of DMD gene full analysis, encompassing DNA
extraction, amplification, sequencing, data analysis, and result
interpretation.
3. Responsibility
• Laboratory Technician: Responsible for performing DNA
extraction, amplification, sequencing, and initial data handling.
• Molecular Geneticist: Responsible for data analysis, variant
interpretation, and result reporting.
• Laboratory Supervisor: Responsible for overseeing the entire
process and ensuring compliance with established protocols, and
for addressing any discrepancies or issues that arise.
4. Definition
• DMD Gene: The dystrophin gene involved in Duchenne Muscular
Dystrophy.
• Full Gene Analysis: A comprehensive examination of the entire
DMD gene to identify mutations or variants that cause Duchenne
Muscular Dystrophy.
5. Procedure
A. DNA Extraction
1. Sample Preparation
◦ Ensure that the specimen has been collected, received, and
accessioned according to laboratory standards.
◦ Use standard procedures for handling clinical specimens to
prevent contamination.
2. Extraction Protocol
◦ Follow kit-specific instructions for DNA extraction, e.g., using
QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit.
◦ Quantify the extracted DNA using a spectrophotometer and
verify purity.
B. Amplification
1. Primer Design
◦ Design primers to cover all exons and flanking intronic
regions of the DMD gene.
◦ Verify primer specificity using in silico tools such as BLAST.
2. PCR Setup
◦ Prepare the PCR mix according to the specific protocol,
ensuring that all reagents are within expiry dates.
◦ Perform PCR amplification using a thermal cycler, following
the optimized cycling conditions for each specific primer set.
3. Quality Control
◦ Verify amplification success using gel electrophoresis.
◦ Use a molecular weight marker to confirm the expected size
of PCR products.
C. Sequencing
1. Sequencing Method
◦ Perform sequencing using Next-Generation Sequencing
(NGS) platforms such as Illumina or Sanger sequencing if
NGS is not available.
2. Library Preparation
◦ Construct sequencing libraries using standard protocols,
ensuring proper adapter ligation and library amplification.
3. Sequencer Setup
◦ Load the prepared libraries onto the sequencer according to
the manufacturer's instructions.
◦ Run the sequencing protocol, ensuring proper calibration
and maintenance of the sequencer according to the
laboratory's standard practices.
D. Data Analysis
1. Raw Data Processing
◦ Use bioinformatics software to filter and process raw
sequencing data.
◦ Align sequences to the reference human genome
(GRCh38).
2. Variant Calling
◦ Identify variants using suitable variant calling algorithms,
e.g., GATK or VarScan.
◦ Annotate variants using databases such as ClinVar, HGMD,
and dbSNP.
3. Interpretation
◦ Interpret the significance of identified variants according to
ACMG guidelines.
◦ Correlate findings with patient clinical data to assess the
impact on the phenotype.
E. Reporting
1. Result Compilation
◦ Compile identified variants, their annotations, and clinical
significance into a coherent report.
◦ Include a clear explanation of detected pathogenic variants,
probable contributors to the disease.
2. Verification
◦ Have all data and interpretations reviewed by a molecular
geneticist.
◦ Ensure that results are accurate and validated before
reporting.
3. Result Distribution
◦ Communicate results to the ordering clinician via secure
laboratory information systems.
◦ Ensure confidentiality and compliance with HIPAA
regulations.
6. Quality Control and Assurance
• Internal Quality Control
◦ Include positive and negative controls in every batch of DNA
extraction, PCR, and sequencing.
◦ Perform regular calibration of instruments and participate in
external proficiency testing.
• Record Keeping
◦ Maintain accurate records of all procedures, including reagent
lot numbers, sample IDs, and detailed steps taken.
◦ Document any deviations or issues encountered during the
analysis.
