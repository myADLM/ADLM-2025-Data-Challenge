Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for
Analytical Phase of DMPK DNA Test (DM1)
1. PURPOSE
The DMPK DNA Test (DM1) aims to identify the CTG trinucleotide
repeat expansion in the DMPK gene, which is associated with
myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1). This SOP outlines the procedures
for the analytical phase to ensure accurate and consistent generation
of results.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the
analytical procedures, ensuring quality control, and documenting all
steps according to this SOP.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred Specimen:
• 3-5 mL whole blood collected in EDTA (lavender top tube).
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Clotted samples
• Hemolyzed samples
• Samples collected in non-EDTA tubes
• Specimens received more than 72 hours after collection
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• PCR Thermocycler
• Gel Electrophoresis system
• DNA Extraction Kit
• PCR Master Mix (including primers specific for DMPK gene)
• Agarose Gel (2%)
• Ethidium Bromide staining solution or equivalent
• DNA Ladder (molecular weight marker)
• Imaging system for gel documentation
4. PROCEDURE
DNA Extraction from Whole Blood
1. DNA Extraction:
◦ Follow the manufacturer's instructions provided with the
DNA extraction kit.
◦ Ensure to store extracted DNA at -20°C until further
processing.
PCR Amplification
1. Preparation of PCR Master Mix:
◦ Prepare PCR master mix with primers specific for the DMPK
gene, dNTPs, Taq polymerase, buffer, and extracted DNA.
◦ Follow the recommended concentrations and volumes as
per the kit instructions.
2. PCR Cycling Conditions:
◦ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 5 minutes
◦ Denaturation: 95°C for 30 seconds
◦ Annealing: 60°C for 30 seconds
◦ Extension: 72°C for 1 minute
◦ Final extension: 72°C for 7 minutes
◦ Number of cycles: 35
Gel Electrophoresis
1. Preparation of Agarose Gel:
◦ Prepare a 2% agarose gel in TAE buffer and add ethidium
bromide or equivalent for visualization.
◦ Pour the gel into the mold and allow it to solidify.
2. Loading PCR Products:
◦ Load 10 μL of PCR product mixed with loading dye into
each well of the agarose gel.
◦ Include a DNA ladder (molecular weight marker) for size
comparison.
3. Electrophoresis:
◦ Run the gel at 100 volts for approximately 1 hour or until
bands are well-separated.
Imaging and Analysis
1. Gel Visualization:
◦ Visualize the gel using UV light or equivalent imaging
system.
◦ Document the gel image for further analysis.
2. Analysis:
◦ Compare the band sizes of the PCR products to the DNA
ladder.
◦ Determine the number of CTG repeats based on the size of
the amplified products.
◦ Use appropriate software tools for more detailed analysis if
needed.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include positive and negative controls in each PCR run to ensure
the accuracy of results.
• Run duplicates or triplicates of samples where necessary to
confirm repeatability of results.
• Document all observations, including any deviations or
abnormalities in the analysis.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
• Review the gel images thoroughly and verify the repeat number.
• Enter the results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Ensure results are reviewed and verified by the designated
laboratory technologist.
• Report critical values immediately to the designated healthcare
professionals as per laboratory guidelines.
7. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's instructions for DNA extraction kits and PCR
reagents.
• Published literature and guidelines on DMPK gene analysis for
DM1.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• False positives or negatives may occur if DNA extraction or PCR
amplification fails.
• Degraded or insufficient DNA can affect the accuracy of the
results.
• Primers must be specific to avoid non-specific amplification.
DOCUMENTATION
• Ensure all steps are documented in the laboratory logbook.
• Record the date, time, and initials of the staff member performing
the procedure.
• Document any troubleshooting steps taken and corrective actions
implemented.
Tracking and Monitoring:
Validation:
• Confirm the validity of the equipment and reagents used.
• Perform regular calibration and maintenance of PCR
Thermocycler and imaging systems.
Review:
• Regularly review procedure compliance through internal audits.
• Update the SOP accordingly based on the audit findings and
improvements.
This SOP ensures the consistent and reliable analysis of DMPK DNA
testing (DM1), contributing to high-quality patient care and accurate
diagnosis of myotonic dystrophy type 1.
