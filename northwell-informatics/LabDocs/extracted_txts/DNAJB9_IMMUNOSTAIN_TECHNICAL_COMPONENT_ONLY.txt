DNAJB9 Immunostain Protocol
1. PURPOSE To outline the standard procedure for performing the
technical component of the DNAJB9 immunostaining process
on tissue specimens to ensure consistent, reliable, and
accurate results.
Responsibility: It is the responsibility of trained laboratory
technologists to adhere to this procedure while conducting DNAJB9
immunostaining. Supervisors are responsible for ensuring training,
adherence, and quality control of the process.
1. EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS
• Microscopy slides
• Microtome
• Drying oven
• Deparaffinization reagents (xylene)
• Rehydration reagents (graded alcohol series and deionized water)
• Antigen retrieval solution (Citrate buffer, pH 6.0 or EDTA buffer,
pH 8.0)
• DNAJB9 primary antibody
• Secondary antibody (biotinylated or conjugated to an enzyme
such as HRP)
• Immunodetection system (e.g., DAB substrate kit)
• Blocking reagent (e.g., normal serum or bovine serum albumin)
• Wash buffer (e.g., PBS with Tween 20)
• Mounting medium
• Coverslips
• Positive and negative control tissues
• Microscope
• Incubation chamber
• Slide staining rack
1. PROCEDURE
A) Specimen Preparation
1. Section paraffin-embedded tissue blocks at 4-5 microns
thickness using a microtome.
2. Mount the tissue sections on positively charged microscope
slides.
3. Dry slides overnight at 37°C in a drying oven.
B) Deparaffinization and Rehydration
1. Deparaffinize slides in xylene for 2 changes, 5 minutes each.
2. Rehydrate slides through a graded alcohol series: a. 100%
ethanol for 2 changes, 3 minutes each. b. 95% ethanol for 1
change, 2 minutes. c. 70% ethanol for 1 change, 2 minutes. d.
Rinse in deionized water for 2 minutes.
C) Antigen Retrieval
1. Place slides in a heat-resistant staining rack.
2. Perform antigen retrieval by immersing slides in preheated
antigen retrieval solution (citrate buffer pH 6.0 or EDTA buffer
pH 8.0) and heat in a microwave or water bath at 95-100°C for
20 minutes.
3. Allow slides to cool in the antigen retrieval solution for 20
minutes at room temperature.
4. Rinse slides in deionized water followed by wash buffer.
D) Immunostaining
1. Block endogenous peroxidase activity by incubating slides in
3% hydrogen peroxide solution for 10 minutes at room
temperature. Wash slides in wash buffer.
2. Block non-specific binding by applying blocking reagent for 20
minutes at room temperature.
3. Incubate slides with DNAJB9 primary antibody diluted in
antibody diluent for 1 hour at room temperature or overnight at
4°C in a humidified chamber.
4. Wash slides in wash buffer, 3 changes, 5 minutes each.
5. Incubate slides with appropriate secondary antibody for 30
minutes at room temperature.
6. Wash slides in wash buffer, 3 changes, 5 minutes each.
7. Develop color by incubating slides with DAB substrate
according to the manufacturer’s instructions until the desired
staining intensity is achieved.
8. Wash slides in deionized water to stop the reaction.
E) Counterstaining
1. Counterstain with hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes.
2. Rinse slides in deionized water.
3. Differentiate with acid alcohol (1% hydrochloric acid in 70%
ethanol) briefly and rinse immediately in running tap water.
4. Blue slides in ammonia water or similar bluing solution, then
rinse in water.
F) Dehydration and Mounting
1. Dehydrate slides through graded alcohols: a. 70% ethanol for 1
change, 2 minutes. b. 95% ethanol for 1 change, 2 minutes. c.
100% ethanol for 2 changes, 2 minutes each.
2. Clear slides in xylene for 2 changes, 3 minutes each.
3. Mount slides with permanent mounting medium and coverslip.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
5. Ensure each run includes positive and negative control tissues.
6. The staining intensity and pattern of the positive control should
be consistent with expected results.
7. Negative control should show no staining.
8. Document staining results, control observations, and any
deviations in the laboratory log.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
10. Report the technical findings to the pathologist for evaluation.
11. Include details of the staining quality, any technical issues
encountered, and control results.
