Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for DNA Double-Stranded
(dsDNA) Antibodies by Crithidia Luciliae IFA, IgG, Serum
1. PURPOSE
To outline the methodology and procedures for the detection of
double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) antibodies using the Crithidia luciliae
Indirect Fluorescent Antibody (IFA) technique. This test is essential
for diagnosing and monitoring autoimmune diseases such as
Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE).
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to the clinical laboratory personnel trained in
performing the Crithidia luciliae IFA technique for the detection of
dsDNA antibodies in patient serum samples.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of laboratory personnel to follow this SOP
carefully to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the test results.
Supervisors are responsible for ensuring all staff members are
appropriately trained and comply with the procedure.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred Specimen: Serum
• Volume: Minimum 0.5 mL
• Collection: Collect blood in a serum separator tube (SST). Allow
the blood to clot at room temperature, then centrifuge and
separate serum.
• Stability: Serum is stable for up to 7 days refrigerated at 2-8°C
and up to 1 month frozen at -20°C.
5. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• Crithidia luciliae slides (commercially prepared and fixed C.
luciliae substrates)
• Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.2-7.4
• IgG-specific fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-
human IgG
• Positive and negative control sera
• Mounting medium (e.g., glycerol/PBS)
• Cover slips
• Fluorescent microscope with appropriate filters
• Humidity chamber
• Pipettes and tips
• Glass slides and labeling materials
6. PROCEDURE
6.1 Preparation and Initial Checks
1. Review the accessioning of samples to ensure proper
identification.
2. Thaw serum samples, if frozen, to room temperature before
testing.
6.2 Slide Preparation
1. Place the Crithidia luciliae slide in a humidity chamber to
prevent drying out.
2. Pipette 20 µL of patient serum, positive control, and negative
control onto respective wells on the slide.
6.3 Incubation
1. Incubate the slide at room temperature for 30 minutes.
2. Ensure the slide is kept moist throughout the incubation period.
6.4 Washing
1. Gently wash the slide with PBS by immersing it in a staining
dish filled with PBS for 5 minutes. Repeat washing 3 times.
2. Carefully blot around the wells with absorbent paper to remove
excess PBS, taking care not to touch the wells directly.
6.5 Application of Conjugate
1. Pipette 20 µL of the FITC-conjugated anti-human IgG onto each
well.
2. Incubate at room temperature in the humidity chamber for 30
minutes.
6.6 Final Washing
1. Repeat the washing process as outlined in step 6.4.
2. Blot gently as before.
6.7 Mounting and Examination
1. Apply a drop of mounting medium onto each well, and carefully
place a cover slip over the slide.
2. Examine the slide under a fluorescent microscope at 400x
magnification.
6.8 Interpretation of Results
1. Observe for the characteristic apple-green fluorescence of
dsDNA binding in the kinetoplast.
2. Compare patient samples against controls:
◦ Positive Control: Distinct bright green fluorescence in the
kinetoplast region indicates a positive reaction.
◦ Negative Control: No specific fluorescence in the
kinetoplast region.
◦ Patient Sample: Evaluate and record fluorescence intensity
compared to the controls.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Include both positive and negative controls in each run to
ensure test integrity.
2. Perform regular maintenance and calibration of the fluorescent
microscope as per manufacturer’s instructions.
3. Use only validated lots of reagents and record lot numbers and
expiry dates in QC logs.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Record results as either “Positive” or “Negative” for dsDNA
antibodies.
2. If results are positive, quantify the fluorescence intensity (e.g.,
+, ++, +++).
9. LIMITATIONS
1. Non-specific binding and background fluorescence can occur;
controls are essential for delineating specific binding.
2. Handling and storage conditions of sera and reagents can
affect test outcomes; strictly follow storage and handling
guidelines.
3. Results should be correlated with clinical findings and other
laboratory tests for comprehensive diagnosis.

handling.
11. REVISIONS AND DOCUMENT CONTROL
Document revisions must be recorded, and staff must be trained on
updates. This SOP will be reviewed annually or as necessary to
reflect current best practices and regulatory requirements.
By adhering to this SOP, laboratory personnel will ensure accurate
and reliable detection of dsDNA antibodies critical for patient care in
autoimmune disease management.
