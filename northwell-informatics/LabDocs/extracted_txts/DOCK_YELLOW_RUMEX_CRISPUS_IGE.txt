Title: Protocol for Analytical Phase of DOCK YELLOW (Rumex
crispus) IgE Determination
1. PURPOSE This SOP outlines the procedures for generating
results for DOCK YELLOW (Rumex crispus) IgE determination in
patient samples using immunological assays in a CLIA-certified
laboratory.
2. RESPONSIBILITY Designated laboratory staff are responsible for
performing the assay, ensuring quality control, validating results, and
maintaining accurate documentation. Supervisors are responsible for
overseeing compliance with this SOP and addressing any issues that
may arise.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred Specimen: Serum or plasma collected in a red-top or
SST (Serum Separator Tube).
• Volume: Minimum of 1 mL.
• Storage: Specimens should be stored at -20°C if not immediately
processed.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• ImmunoCAP™ system or equivalent for IgE determination.
• DOCK YELLOW-specific IgE test kit.
• Calibration and control materials.
• Micropipettes and tips.
• Centrifuge.
• Vortex mixer.
• Incubator.
• Refrigerators and freezers (temperature monitored and
controlled).
5. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Turn on the ImmunoCAP™ system and perform initial
equipment checks as per manufacturer guidelines.
2. Ensure all reagents are at room temperature unless otherwise
specified by the manufacturer.
Assay Procedure:
1. Sample Preparation:
◦ Thaw serum/plasma samples if previously frozen.
◦ Centrifuge samples at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes to remove
any particulates.
◦ Aliquot samples to appropriate microtubes for testing,
ensuring proper labeling.
2. Reagent Preparation:
◦ Prepare reagents according to the manufacturer’s
instructions provided in the DOCK YELLOW-specific IgE
test kit insert.
◦ Label all reagents and standards properly with date and
time of preparation.
3. Calibration and Quality Control:
◦ Run calibrators and control samples at low, medium, and
high IgE concentrations as per kit instructions.
◦ Verify calibration curve and ensure control sample results
are within acceptable ranges before proceeding to patient
samples.
4. Sample Analysis:
◦ Load patient samples, calibrators, and controls into the
ImmunoCAP™ system.
◦ Initiate the assay run as per system procedure.
◦ Record the start time and sample identification.
5. Result Generation:
◦ Review and validate the results generated by the system.
◦ Ensure results for each sample meet defined quality criteria
(e.g., controls within range, calibrator check).
◦ Document any deviations and corrective actions taken.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Check all reagents for expiration dates and lot numbers before
use.
• Include positive and negative internal controls with each batch of
patient samples.
• Perform daily calibration verification and document results.
• Maintain a temperature log for equipment used in the assay.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results are automatically transmitted to the LIS (Laboratory
Information System).
• Laboratory technologists review and verify all results before final
reporting.
• Flag and report any critical values according to laboratory policy.
• Document any troubleshooting steps and provide comments in
the LIS if needed.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Intra-assay and inter-assay variation must be monitored and
minimized.
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples may affect assay
performance.
• Refer to the specific IgE kit insert for detailed limitations affecting
the accuracy of the test.
9. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's insert for DOCK YELLOW-specific IgE
determination kit.
• ImmunoCAP™ system user manual.
10. DOCUMENTATION AND ARCHIVING
• Ensure all patient results, control results, calibrations, and
maintenance logs are documented and archived according to lab
policy.
• Retain records for a minimum of two years or as mandated by
regulatory requirements.
By following this protocol, the laboratory ensures the accurate
determination of DOCK YELLOW (Rumex crispus) IgE levels in
patient samples, contributing to the effective diagnosis and
management of IgE-mediated conditions.
