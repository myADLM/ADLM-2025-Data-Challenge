DOG-1 Immunostain, Technical Component Only - Standard
Operating Procedure (SOP)
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedures for performing
the technical component of DOG-1 immunostaining on tissue
sections. The DOG-1 immunostain is predominantly utilized to assist
in the diagnosis of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST). The
protocol covers section preparation, staining, quality control, and
result documentation.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the histology laboratory staff and
technologists to ensure that the procedures described in this SOP are
followed accurately and diligently. Supervisors should verify that the
staining process is correctly performed and documented, and
address any identified deficiencies.
1. DEFINITIONS
DOG-1 Immunostain: An immunohistochemical stain used on
formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue sections to detect
DOG-1 protein, an indicator often associated with GIST.
1. SPECIMEN
Specimen Type: Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue
sections.
Specimen Requirements: Ensure tissue blocks are adequately fixed
and cut into 4-5 micron thick sections and mounted onto positively
charged slides.
Storage: Tissue sections on slides can be stored at room
temperature for up to two weeks before staining. Longer storage
requires refrigeration at 2-8°C.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Positively charged slides
• Microtome
• Water bath
• Drying oven
• Xylene (and substitute)
• Ethanol (100%, 95%, 70%, and 50%)
• Distilled water
• Antigen retrieval solution (citrate buffer pH 6.0 or EDTA pH 8.0)
• DOG-1 primary antibody
• Secondary antibody (HRP-linked)
• DAB chromogen kit
• Hematoxylin (counterstain)
• Mounting medium
• Coverslips
• Humidity chamber
• Staining rack
• Positive control tissues
• Negative control tissues
1. PROCEDURE
A) Slide Preparation
1. Sectioning:
◦ Cut FFPE tissue blocks into 4-5 micron thick sections using
a microtome.
◦ Float sections on a warm water bath (37-40°C) and pick
them up with positively charged slides.
◦ Dry sections overnight in a 37°C oven or for 1 hour at 60°C.
2. Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
◦ Deparaffinize slides in xylene (or substitute) for 3 changes of
5 minutes each.
◦ Rehydrate slides through a graded alcohol series (100%,
95%, 70%, 50%) for 2 minutes each.
◦ Rinse slides in distilled water.
B) Antigen Retrieval
1. Heat-Induced Epitope Retrieval (HIER):
◦ Place slides in a container filled with antigen retrieval
solution (e.g., citrate buffer or EDTA).
◦ Heat in a microwave, pressure cooker, or steamer according
to manufacturer's instructions (typically boiling for 10-20
minutes).
◦ Allow slides to cool for 20 minutes at room temperature.
◦ Rinse slides in distilled water.
C) Immunostaining
1. Blocking:
◦ Treat slides with a blocking solution, per manufacturer’s
instructions, to reduce nonspecific binding.
◦ Incubate for 10 minutes.
2. Primary Antibody Incubation:
◦ Apply DOG-1 primary antibody to the tissue sections.
◦ Incubate for 30-60 minutes in a humidity chamber.
3. Washing:
◦ Wash slides in buffer solution (e.g., PBS or TBS) for 3
changes of 5 minutes each.
4. Secondary Antibody Incubation:
◦ Apply the HRP-linked secondary antibody.
◦ Incubate for 30 minutes in a humidity chamber.
5. Washing:
◦ Wash slides in buffer solution (e.g., PBS or TBS) for 3
changes of 5 minutes each.
6. DAB Chromogen Application:
◦ Apply DAB chromogen according to the kit instructions.
◦ Incubate until the desired color intensity is reached (usually
3-10 minutes).
◦ Wash slides in distilled water.
D) Counterstaining and Mounting
1. Counterstaining:
◦ Counterstain with hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes.
◦ Wash slides in running tap water.
◦ Differentiate in acid alcohol if necessary and blue in water.
2. Dehydration and Clearing:
◦ Dehydrate slides through graded alcohol series (70%, 95%,
and 100%).
◦ Clear in xylene for 3 changes of 5 minutes each.
3. Mounting:
◦ Apply mounting medium and cover with a coverslip.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include positive and negative control slides with each staining run.
• Review controls to ensure staining quality before interpreting
patient samples.
• Record control results and any discrepancies in the QC log.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results are reviewed by the pathologist.
• Document stained slide quality, any deviations to the procedure,
and results.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instruction for primary and secondary antibodies
and kits used.
• In-house histology and immunohistochemistry manuals.
1. RECORDING AND DOCUMENTATION
• Maintain a log of all specimens processed, staining conditions,
and results.
• Detailed records of QC results and corrective actions must be
filed.
NOTE: Always adhere to good laboratory practices and institution-
specific protocols. Use of PPE and proper waste disposal methods
are mandatory during the procedure.
This SOP must be reviewed annually or as required to reflect any
changes in techniques, reagents, or instrumentation. Any deviations
or modifications from this protocol must be documented and
approved by the laboratory supervisor.
