STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP)
DOG DANDER, IGE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedures for the
qualitative and quantitative determination of Dog Dander-specific
Immunoglobulin E (IgE) in human serum samples using a designated
immunoassay analyzer.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory staff responsible for
performing and reporting the Dog Dander IgE levels in serum
samples.
3. RESPONSIBILITIES
• Laboratory Technologists: Perform the assay according to this
SOP, ensure quality control, and document results accurately.
• Supervisors: Oversee the performance of the assay, review
quality control data, and approve final results for reporting.
• Quality Control Personnel: Ensure all reagents and equipment
are calibrated and maintain quality control records.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred Specimen: Serum.
• Collection Container: SST (serum separator tube).
• Specimen Volume: 1 mL minimum.
• Specimen Stability: Serum stable for up to 7 days when stored
at 2-8°C. For long-term storage, keep at -20°C.
• Unacceptable Specimens: Hemolyzed, lipemic, or contaminated
specimens.
5. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Designated immunoassay analyzer (e.g., ImmunoCAP, ELISA, or
similar).
• Dog Dander-specific IgE reagent kit.
• Calibrators and controls.
• Pipettes and disposable tips.
• Vortex mixer.
• Centrifuge.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform quality control (QC) with each run using low, medium,
and high value controls.
• Record QC results and verify they are within acceptable ranges
before reporting patient results.
• If QC results are out of range, troubleshoot and rerun the controls.
Do not report patient results until QC passes.
7. PROCEDURE
Pre-analytical Phase:
1. Specimen Receipt and Handling:
◦ Ensure the specimen is correctly labeled and matches the
requisition form.
◦ Centrifuge the SST tube at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes to
separate serum.
◦ Aliquot the serum sample into a labeled secondary tube if
required.
Analytical Phase:
1. Preparation:
◦ Set up the immunoassay analyzer as per manufacturer’s
instructions.
◦ Allow reagents, controls, and calibrators to reach room
temperature before use.
◦ Prepare calibrators and controls according to the kit
instructions.
2. Assay Procedure:
◦ Load reagents, calibrators, and controls onto the analyzer.
◦ Load patient serum samples into the analyzer.
◦ Select the appropriate assay method (e.g., Dog Dander-
specific IgE) on the analyzer.
◦ Initiate the assay run.
◦ Ensure all samples, controls, and calibrators are processed
according to the specified protocol.
3. Analyzing Results:
◦ Upon assay completion, review the data generated by the
analyzer.
◦ Validate that all controls are within the acceptable ranges.
◦ Compare patient IgE levels to calibrator curves to determine
the IgE concentration in serum samples.
4. Troubleshooting:
◦ Check for any flags or error messages generated by the
analyzer.
◦ Address any issues in accordance with troubleshooting
guidelines provided by the analyzer's manufacturer.
◦ Repeat testing if initial results are invalid or if there are
issues with the assay performance.
8. POST-ANALYTICAL PHASE
1. Result Verification:
◦ Review the results and ensure they correlate with the
control results.
◦ Investigate and resolve any discrepancies prior to result
reporting.
2. Result Reporting:
◦ Enter verified results into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
◦ Report results according to site-specific guidelines, ensuring
inclusion of reference intervals and any pertinent comments.
9. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Reference ranges for Dog Dander-specific IgE levels will be
provided with the reagent kit instructions and may vary; ensure to
use the appropriate reference ranges provided by the assay
manufacturer.
10. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to the assay kit insert for specific limitations including cross-
reactivity, interference from hemolysis, lipemia, or icterus, and
assay specificity and sensitivity.
11. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's kit insert for the Dog Dander IgE reagent.
• Calibration and quality control manuals provided with the
immunoassay analyzer.
• Laboratory standard operating procedures for immunoassay
analyzers.
12. DOCUMENTATION
• Maintain a log of all assay runs, including patient results, QC
results, and any maintenance or troubleshooting performed.
• Store all documentation in accordance with laboratory record
retention policies.
By following these procedures, accurate and reliable results for Dog
Dander-specific IgE in serum can be achieved, ensuring high quality
in the analytical phase of immunodiagnostic testing.
