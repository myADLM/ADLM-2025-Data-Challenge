Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for DOG DANDER, IGE,
WITH REFLEX TO DOG DANDER COMPONENTS, IGE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the steps for the efficient and
accurate analytical process of measuring Dog Dander IgE levels in
serum with reflex testing to Dog Dander Components IgE. This
ensures reliable results and timely reporting for clinical diagnostics.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the assigned laboratory staff to follow this
procedure and ensure accurate results. The supervisor must review
and ensure proper quality control and documentation compliance.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Serum
• Preferred Specimen: 5 mL of venous blood collected in a serum
separator tube (SST) or another appropriate collection system.
• Stability: Serum should be separated from the clot and
refrigerated (2-8°C) if not immediately analyzed. If long-term
storage is required, serum should be frozen (-20°C or colder).
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• ImmunoCAP system or similar: Capable of performing quantitative
measurement of IgE
• Dog Dander IgE specific assays
• Dog Dander Component IgE assays
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Serum separator tubes (SST)
• Refrigerator and freezer for sample storage
• Quality control materials and calibrators
5. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation for Analysis
1. Ensure all necessary materials and reagents are available and
within their expiration dates.
2. Prepare a workspace to perform serum separation and assay
testing.
B. Serum Separation
1. Centrifuge blood collection tubes at 2000-3000 RPM for 10
minutes to separate serum.
2. Transfer the serum to appropriately labeled secondary tubes.
3. Store serum at 2-8°C if not immediately processed.
C. Dog Dander IgE Measurement
1. Prepare the ImmunoCAP system following manufacturer
instructions.
2. Load serum samples on the machine according to the specified
procedure.
3. Run Dog Dander IgE assays according to the instructions
provided.
D. Reflex Testing to Dog Dander Components IgE
1. If Dog Dander IgE levels exceed the predetermined threshold
(as specified by clinical guidelines), proceed with reflex testing
to Dog Dander Components IgE.
2. Load serum samples on the machine for component-specific
testing.
3. Run the assays for each specified component (e.g., Can f 1,
Can f 2, etc.).
E. Quality Control
1. Run quality control materials alongside patient samples to
ensure analytical accuracy.
2. Accept results only if quality control metrics are within
established acceptable ranges.
6. RESULTS INTERPRETATION AND REPORTING
1. Results are transmitted to the Laboratory Information System
(LIS) for review.
2. Technologist reviews results for accuracy and verifies QC
compliance.
3. Document any reflex testing performed.
4. Report verified results to the appropriate clinical team, ensuring
reflex results are clearly indicated.
7. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Dog Dander IgE: Refer to specific assay insert for established
reference ranges.
• Dog Dander Components IgE: Refer to specific assay insert for
established reference ranges for each component.
8. LIMITATIONS
Refer to the ImmunoCAP device manual and assay package inserts
for limitations related to interference, sensitivity, and specificity of Dog
Dander IgE and component assays.
