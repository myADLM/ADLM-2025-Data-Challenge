PROTOCOL FOR ANALYTICAL PHASE OF DOG FENNEL
(ANTHEMIS COTULA) IGE TESTING
1. PURPOSE
This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) outlines the systematic
procedure for the quantification of Dog Fennel (Anthemis cotula) IgE
antibodies in human serum or plasma using an immunoassay
method. Accurate determination of specific IgE levels aids in
diagnosing allergic responses to Dog Fennel.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of designated laboratory personnel to:
• Perform the assay following this SOP.
• Ensure accurate documentation of all procedures and results.
• Follow corrective actions if control measures fall outside
established limits.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type:
• Serum or plasma (EDTA or heparinized).
• Collected using standard venipuncture techniques.
Specimen Handling:
• Centrifuge and separate serum or plasma from cells within 2
hours of collection.
• Store specimens at 2-8°C if analyzed within 7 days. For longer
storage, keep at -20°C or lower.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
4. EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS
• Immunoassay analyzer
• Dog Fennel (Anthemis cotula) IgE reagent kit
• Calibrators and controls (provided in the kit)
• Pipettes and tips
• Microcentrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Timer
• Laboratory-grade water
• Appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE)
5. REAGENT PREPARATION
• All reagents should be brought to room temperature before use.
• Reconstitute and prepare reagents, calibrators, and controls
according to the manufacturer’s instructions provided in the kit.
6. CALIBRATION AND QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform calibration using the calibrators provided in the reagent
kit.
• Ensure the calibration curve is valid before proceeding with
patient sample testing.
• Run quality control samples at two different concentrations (low
and high) with each assay batch.
• The assay must pass QC criteria before patient results can be
reported. If controls are outside the acceptable range,
troubleshoot and repeat the QC.
7. PROCEDURE
1. Sample Preparation:
◦ Label sample tubes.
◦ Pipette the required volume of serum or plasma into the
sample tubes.
◦ Mix samples thoroughly using a vortex mixer.
2. Assay Procedure:
◦ Load samples, calibrators, and controls into the
immunoassay analyzer according to the instrument’s
instructions.
◦ Follow the analyzer's instructions for the specific Dog
Fennel IgE method, including any incubation times and
washing steps.
◦ Initiate the run on the analyzer.
3. Instrument Settings:
◦ Ensure the immunoassay analyzer settings are correctly
programmed for the Dog Fennel IgE assay.
◦ Verify settings for incubation time, washing steps, and
detection parameters according to the manufacturer’s
protocol.
4. Result Analysis:
◦ Upon completion of the run, retrieve results from the
analyzer.
◦ Review the calibration curve and QC results to confirm
assay validity.
◦ Verify the results for each patient sample.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Record results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS) or
manually, ensuring accurate transcription of values.
• Report quantifiable results as IU/mL. Typical reference ranges
should be included in the final report.
• Flag and review any critical values per laboratory guidelines.
9. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
• Results are interpreted based on the established clinical ranges
for Dog Fennel IgE.
• Consult specific reference ranges and cut-offs for clinical decision
making.
• In the event of equivocal results, additional testing may be
recommended.
10. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Cross-reactivity with other inhalant allergens may occur.
• The assay is intended for diagnostic use in symptomatic patients.
Asymptomatic individuals with low IgE levels may not exhibit
allergic reactions.
11. QUALITY CONTROL AND TROUBLESHOOTING
• Document any deviations from the protocol and corrective actions
taken.
• Regularly maintain and troubleshoot the immunoassay analyzer
as per manufacturer guidelines.
• If persistent issues exist with QC, coordinate with technical
support from the reagent manufacturer.
12. DOCUMENTATION AND RECORD KEEPING
• Maintain records of all calibrations, QC results, and patient
results.
• Ensure traceability of all results and associated QC data.
