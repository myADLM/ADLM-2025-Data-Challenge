Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Donath-Landsteiner Test
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the analytical phase of the
Donath-Landsteiner (DL) test, ensuring accurate and reliable results
for the diagnosis of paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria (PCH).
Responsibility: All designated staff are responsible for performing the
DL test according to this SOP, documenting all steps, and reporting
any deviations or deficiencies.
1. DEFINITION
The Donath-Landsteiner test is a serological assay used to detect
biphasic hemolysis caused by the Donath-Landsteiner antibody,
indicative of paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria (PCH).
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Preferred Specimen:
• Freshly collected whole blood in two EDTA tubes and one clotted
tube.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens that have been frozen.
• Specimens with hemolysis prior to testing.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• Water bath with accurate temperature control (37°C and 4°C)
• Centrifuge
• Test tubes
• Normal saline (0.9% NaCl)
• Refrigerator
• Anti-human globulin (AHG) reagent, polyspecific
• Micropipettes and tips
1. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation:
1. Collect whole blood samples in two EDTA tubes and one clotted
tube.
◦ Label tubes appropriately.
2. Allow clot tube to sit at room temperature until a clot has
formed.
B) Plasma Preparation:
1. Centrifuge one EDTA tube to separate plasma.
2. Carefully transfer the plasma to a clean test tube.
3. Store plasma at 4°C until ready for use in the assay.
C) Hemolysis Assay Setup:
1. In a clean test tube, prepare a 5% suspension of red blood cells
(RBCs) from the clotted blood tube in normal saline.
◦ Mix thoroughly.
2. Set up two separate sets of test tubes labeled 'Test' and
'Control'.
D) Incubation:
1. Add 0.5 mL of patient plasma to each 'Test' and 'Control' tube.
2. Add 0.5 mL of normal saline to each 'Control' tube.
3. Add 0.5 mL of the 5% RBC suspension to all tubes.
4. Mix gently but thoroughly.
5. Place the 'Test' tubes in a water bath at 4°C for 30 minutes.
6. After 30 minutes, transfer the 'Test' tubes to a water bath at
37°C for 60 minutes.
7. Keep the 'Control' tubes in the water bath at 37°C for 90
minutes continuously (without the initial 4°C step).
E) Examination:
1. After incubation, centrifuge all tubes at a low speed (1500 rpm)
for 10 minutes.
2. Examine the supernatant for hemolysis visually:
◦ Positive DL test: Visible hemolysis in 'Test' tubes and no
hemolysis in 'Control' tubes.
◦ Negative DL test: No hemolysis in either 'Test' or 'Control'
tubes.
F) AHG Tests:
1. Perform an anti-human globulin test (AHG) on the sediment of
the 'Test' tubes if hemolysis was observed:
◦ Wash the RBCs with normal saline.
◦ Add AHG reagent.
◦ Centrifuge and observe for agglutination.
G) Documentation:
1. Record test results, including the degree of hemolysis observed
and the AHG test results.
2. Maintain documentation in the laboratory information system
(LIS).
3. Report results to the physician with all pertinent information and
interpretations.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
5. Include a positive control using known DL-positive plasma and
a negative control using known DL-negative plasma.
6. Document all control outcomes to ensure assay validity.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
Refer to site-specific reporting guidelines for detailed instructions on
the documentation and transmission of results.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to reagent-specific inserts for information on individual reagent
limitations. Note the potential for the test to be affected by improper
sample handling, temperature deviations, and specimen quality.
