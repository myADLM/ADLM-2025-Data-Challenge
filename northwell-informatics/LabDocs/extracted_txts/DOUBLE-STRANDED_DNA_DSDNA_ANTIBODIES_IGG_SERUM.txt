Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Double-Stranded DNA (dsDNA) Antibodies,
IgG, Serum
1. PURPOSE
To ensure accurate and reliable results for the detection and
quantification of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) antibodies, IgG, in
serum samples using the designated immunoassay methodology.
This SOP outlines the responsibilities, specimen requirements,
equipment, reagents, calibration procedures, quality control,
analytical procedures, and reporting of results.
1. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel performing the analysis
of dsDNA antibodies, IgG, in serum samples within the laboratory.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the
analysis, ensuring quality control, maintaining records, and reporting
results. It is also the responsibility of all staff to identify any issues
affecting the accuracy of results and to notify their supervisor
promptly.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/Acceptable:
• 2-5 mL of serum collected in a red-top or serum separator tube
(SST).
• Serum should be separated from clot within 2 hours of collection.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, icteric, or lipemic samples.
• Specimens received in unsuitable containers or those that have
not been prepared according to standard procedures.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Automated immunoassay analyzer
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes and tips
• Sample tubes
Reagents:
• dsDNA Antibodies, IgG, assay kit (manufacturer-specific)
• Calibrators and controls as specified by the kit manufacturer
• Wash buffer
• Substrate
• Stop solution
Supplies:
• Disposable gloves
• Laboratory refrigerator/freezer
• Specimen racks
1. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Handling:
1. Allow the serum samples to come to room temperature before
analysis.
2. Inspect each sample for hemolysis, lipemia, or icterus. Reject
unsuitable specimens.
3. Mix samples gently to ensure homogeneity.
B. Calibration:
1. Perform calibration of the immunoassay analyzer according to
the manufacturer's instructions.
2. Use the provided calibrators to create a standard curve within
the acceptable range.
C. Quality Control:
1. Analyze quality control (QC) material at multiple levels (e.g.,
low, medium, high) at the beginning of each run, daily, and
whenever a new reagent lot is used.
2. Record and review QC results to ensure they fall within the
acceptable range as specified by the manufacturer.
D. Analytical Procedure:
1. Load samples, calibrators, and QC material onto the
immunoassay analyzer as instructed by the manufacturer's
protocol.
2. Follow the step-by-step instructions for the dsDNA Antibodies,
IgG, assay provided by the kit manufacturer, including any
incubation periods, wash steps, addition of reagents, and
substrate reactions.
3. The analyzer will process the samples, measure the
absorbance, and calculate the concentration of dsDNA
antibodies, IgG, in the serum samples.
E. Result Verification:
1. Review the results generated by the analyzer.
2. Verify that QC results are within the acceptable range before
accepting patient results.
3. If QC results are out of range, troubleshoot the issue according
to the manufacturer's guidelines and repeat the QC and sample
analysis as necessary.
4. REPORTING RESULTS
5. Record the results, including QC and calibrator data, in the
laboratory information system (LIS).
6. Report results to the clinician with the reference interval
provided by the assay kit manufacturer.
7. Notify the clinician immediately of any critical or unexpected
results.
8. QUALITY ASSURANCE AND TROUBLESHOOTING
9. Regularly maintain and calibrate equipment according to the
manufacturer's recommended schedule.
10. Document any issues, corrective actions taken, and preventive
measures implemented.
11. Participate in external proficiency testing programs to ensure
the accuracy of results.
