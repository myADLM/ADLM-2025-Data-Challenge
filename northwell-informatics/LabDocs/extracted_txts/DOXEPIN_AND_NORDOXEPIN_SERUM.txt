Standard Operating Procedure
Title: Analytical Phase Procedure for Generating Results for Doxepin
and Nordoxepin in Serum
1. PURPOSE
To define a consistent protocol for generating accurate and reliable
results for doxepin and nordoxepin in serum samples using
chromatography techniques.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to the analysis of serum samples for the
presence and concentration of doxepin and nordoxepin within the
laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Laboratory Analysts: Responsible for adhering to this SOP
during the process of analyzing serum samples for doxepin and
nordoxepin.
• Laboratory Supervisors: Ensure that all laboratory personnel
are trained and compliant with this SOP. Review, approve, and
sign-off on final analysis results.
• Quality Control Personnel: Ensure the proper functioning and
calibration of all equipment used in this procedure.
4. DEFINITIONS
• Doxepin: A tricyclic antidepressant used to treat depression and
anxiety.
• Nordoxepin: The primary active metabolite of doxepin.
5. PROCEDURE
5.1 Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies:
• High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) system or
Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)
instrument.
• Calibrated pipettes and consumables.
• Serum sample collection tubes (preferably SERUM SEPARATOR
TUBES - SST).
• Calibration standards for doxepin and nordoxepin.
• Quality control (QC) samples at high and low concentrations.
• Mobile phase solutions (specified solvent and gradient).
• Sample preparation materials (containers, solvents, filters, etc.).
5.2 Sample Preparation:
1. Thawing and Homogenization:
◦ If samples are frozen, allow them to thaw at room
temperature.
◦ Vortex each thawed sample to ensure homogeneity.
2. Serum Separation:
◦ Centrifuge the SST tubes at 1500g for 10 minutes.
◦ Carefully transfer the serum into clean, labeled tubes.
3. Preparation of Calibration Standards and QC Samples:
◦ Prepare a series of calibration standards and QC samples
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Ensure they cover the expected concentration range of
doxepin and nordoxepin in patient samples.
4. Extraction:
◦ Add the appropriate volume of internal standard to each
sample.
◦ Mix the samples with an extraction solvent (e.g., acetonitrile)
to precipitate proteins.
◦ Centrifuge at 1500g for 10 minutes.
◦ Transfer the supernatant to a clean tube and evaporate the
solvent under a stream of nitrogen.
◦ Reconstitute in the mobile phase and filter if necessary.
5.3 Instrumental Analysis:
1. Instrument Setup:
◦ Verify that the HPLC or LC-MS/MS system is calibrated and
subjected to routine maintenance checks.
◦ Load the prepared samples, calibration standards, and QC
samples into the autosampler.
2. Chromatographic Conditions:
◦ Set the specific chromatography parameters (mobile phase
composition, flow rate, injection volume, etc.).
◦ Conduct a blank run to ensure no contamination.
3. Injection and Detection:
◦ Inject an appropriate volume of each sample into the
chromatography system.
◦ Use the specific detection settings for doxepin and
nordoxepin.
4. Data Acquisition:
◦ Acquire and record the retention times and peak areas for
doxepin and nordoxepin.
◦ Verify the analysis for adherence to an acceptable
calibration curve.
5.4 Quality Control and Data Validation:
1. Review QC Results:
◦ Compare QC samples’ results against established
acceptable ranges.
◦ If QC results are outside acceptable ranges, review the
process for potential errors and reanalyze affected samples.
2. Data Validation:
◦ Ensure calibration curves have acceptable correlation
coefficients (≥0.99).
◦ Validate data from patient samples by comparing peaks with
those of the calibration standards.
◦ Identify and record any samples requiring reanalysis due to
poor chromatography or atypical results.
3. Record Keeping:
◦ Document all sample processing steps, including sample
log-in, reagent lot numbers, and chromatography settings.
◦ Record any deviations from the protocol and corrective
actions taken.
