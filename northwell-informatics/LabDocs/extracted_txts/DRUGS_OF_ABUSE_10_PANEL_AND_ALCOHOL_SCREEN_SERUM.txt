Approved By: [Supervisor’s Name]
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is to
outline the analytical procedures for generating accurate and reliable
results for Drugs of Abuse (10 Panel) and Alcohol Screen tests in
serum. This document ensures compliance with relevant regulatory
requirements and provides clear instructions to laboratory personnel.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
• Laboratory Technologists: Responsible for performing the tests
and documenting the results.
• Supervisors: Responsible for ensuring that the procedures are
accurately followed and for troubleshooting any issues that arise.
3. SPECIMENS
• Preferred/Acceptable: Serum collected in SST (Serum Separator
Tube) or Red Top Tube.
• Unacceptable: Specimens that are hemolyzed, lipemic, or
contain any visible particulate matter.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Drugs of Abuse 10-Panel Test Kit
• Alcohol Screen Test Reagent Kit
• Calibrators, Controls (Negative, Low Positive, High Positive)
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
• Laboratory Information System (LIS)
5. PROCEDURE
A) Sample Preparation
1. Receipt and Accessioning: Verify that the specimen is
correctly labelled and accessioned in the Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
2. Centrifugation: Centrifuge the SST or Red Top Tube sample at
3000 RPM for 10 minutes to obtain serum.
3. Aliquoting: Transfer the serum to separate labelled aliquot
tubes if required.
B) Drugs of Abuse (10 Panel)
1. Reagent Preparation: Prepare the reagents, calibrators, and
controls according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Loading Samples: Load the serum samples, calibrators, and
controls onto the designated analyzer.
3. Running the Test:
◦ Select the “Drugs of Abuse 10-Panel” assay from the
analyzer menu.
◦ Start the analysis following the manufacturer’s protocol.
4. Result Interpretation:
◦ The test results will be automatically calculated by the
analyzer.
◦ Review the generated results for any flags or error
messages.
5. Documentation:
◦ Enter the results into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
◦ Ensure that any flagged results are reviewed and verified by
a qualified technologist.
C) Alcohol Screen
1. Reagent Preparation: Prepare the Alcohol Screen reagents,
calibrators, and controls according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
2. Loading Samples: Load the serum samples, calibrators, and
controls onto the designated analyzer for alcohol testing.
3. Running the Test:
◦ Select the “Alcohol Screen” assay from the analyzer menu.
◦ Start the analysis following the manufacturer’s protocol.
4. Result Interpretation:
◦ The test results will be automatically calculated by the
analyzer.
◦ Review the generated results for any flags or error
messages.
5. Documentation:
◦ Enter the results into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
◦ Ensure that any flagged results are reviewed and verified by
a qualified technologist.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Internal Quality Control:
◦ Run internal QC samples (Negative, Low Positive, High
Positive) for both the Drugs of Abuse (10 Panel) and Alcohol
Screen tests according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Document and review QC results before any patient samples
are tested.
• External Quality Control:
◦ Participate in external quality assurance programs as required.
◦ Compare the external QC results with internal results and
address any discrepancies.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Verification and Review:
◦ All results must be reviewed and verified by a qualified
technologist.
◦ Verify that calibration, control materials, and patient results
are within acceptable ranges.
2. Critical Results:
◦ Notify the ordering physician immediately for any critical
result following laboratory protocol.
◦ Document the notification in the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
