Standard Operating Procedure: Analytical Phase of Generating
Results for Drugs of Abuse Screen 4, Chain of Custody,
Meconium
1. PURPOSE:
To outline the procedure for the analysis of meconium specimens for
the detection of drugs of abuse using the Drugs of Abuse Screen 4
(DAU-4) assay under chain of custody protocols, ensuring accurate
and reliable results.
2. SCOPE:
This procedure applies to all staff involved in the analytical phase of
the Drugs of Abuse Screen 4 (DAU-4) testing with meconium
specimens under chain of custody conditions in the laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY:
• Laboratory technicians are responsible for performing the assay
and documenting all steps according to this SOP.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring adherence to the SOP
and addressing any discrepancies.
4. DEFINITIONS:
DAU-4 (Drugs of Abuse Screen 4): An assay designed to detect the
presence of drugs commonly abused, such as opioids, cocaine,
cannabinoids, and amphetamines.
Chain of Custody: A process ensuring the integrity of a specimen
from collection until reporting of results.
Meconium: The first stool produced by an infant, used to test for
prenatal exposure to drugs of abuse.
5. MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT:
• Drugs of Abuse Screen 4 test kit
• Calibrators and controls for DAU-4
• Certified chain of custody forms
• Refrigerated centrifuge
• Pipettes and tips
• Gloves, goggles, and other PPE
• Laboratory Information System (LIS)
• Documentation logbooks and forms
• Properly labeled specimen containers
• Barcode scanner
6. PROCEDURE:
A. Specimen Preparation:
1. Verification:
◦ Verify the integrity of the Chain of Custody (CoC) seal on
the specimen container.
◦ Verify specimen details against requisition forms, ensuring a
match.
2. Logging:
◦ Document receipt of the specimen in the chain of custody
log.
◦ Assign and document unique identification numbers to
specimens for tracking.
3. Meconium Preparation:
◦ Homogenize the meconium sample.
◦ Transfer an aliquot of the homogenized specimen to a
clean, labeled tube following safety and CoC protocols.
◦ Store the original sample appropriately until completion of
the analysis.
B. Calibration and Quality Control:
1. Calibration:
◦ Prepare calibrators according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
◦ Run calibrators to ensure the assay is performing within
acceptable ranges.
2. Quality Control:
◦ Run positive and negative controls to confirm assay validity.
◦ Document all quality control checks and verify against
predefined criteria.
C. Analytical Procedure:
1. Reagent Preparation:
◦ Prepare DAU-4 reagents according to the manufacturer’s
protocols.
◦ Verify expiration dates and document the lot numbers of
reagents used.
2. Sample Analysis:
◦ Load specimens, calibrators, and controls into the testing
analyzer.
◦ Start the analytical run and monitor the process.
◦ Ensure that chain of custody documentation accompanies
each sample throughout analysis.
3. Results Interpretation:
◦ Review the analyzer output for each specimen.
◦ Compare specimen results against calibrator and control
results to ensure accuracy.
◦ Document results in the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
D. Result Validation and Reporting:
1. Validation:
◦ Perform a secondary verification of results, ensuring
matching entry in the LIS.
◦ Address any discrepancies or outliers by reviewing assay
conditions and rerunning affected samples if necessary.
2. Reporting:
◦ Generate final reports from the LIS.
◦ Ensure that reports are reviewed and signed by an
authorized personnel.
◦ Follow protocol to report critical values or unexpected
results immediately.
E. Documentation and Record Keeping:
1. Documentation:
◦ Record all procedural details, including times, initials, and
outcomes, in the audit log.
◦ Maintain the CoC throughout the specimen’s handling.
◦ Cross-check with the chain of custody forms before
finalizing results.
2. Archiving:
◦ Store all completed forms and associated data in secure,
designated areas.
◦ Follow lab protocols for the duration of record keeping and
disposal.
7. QUALITY ASSURANCE:
• Periodically review procedural compliance through internal audits.
• Participate in external proficiency testing programs to benchmark
performance.
• Ensure ongoing staff training and competence in DAU-4 testing
and chain of custody protocols.
