Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Drug of Abuse Screen 5, Chain of Custody, Meconium
1. Purpose
This SOP outlines the procedures for the analysis and result
reporting of Drug of Abuse Screen 5, Chain of Custody tests on
meconium specimens in the laboratory. These procedures ensure the
integrity, reliability, and accuracy of results according to CLIA
standards.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for following the
outlined procedures, conducting proper analyses, and documenting
results accordingly. It is the responsibility of all staff members to
identify any issues related to the analysis and to report them to a
supervisor promptly.
1. Specimen Requirements and Stability
Specimen Type:
• Meconium
Collection and Transportation:
• Specimen should be collected and placed in an appropriate,
clearly labeled container.
• Establish Chain of Custody documentation from the point of
collection to receipt in the laboratory to ensure the integrity of the
specimen.
• Store and transport specimens at appropriate conditions as
mentioned in the specimen collection guidelines to maintain
stability.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens not properly labeled or missing Chain of Custody
documentation.
• Specimens contaminated or degraded (e.g., discolored, dried
out).
• Specimens received in the laboratory outside the acceptable
window time limits if applicable.
1. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies
• Drug of Abuse Screening Kit
• Chain of Custody forms
• Meconium specimen containers
• Necessary laboratory analyzers specific for drug screening (e.g.,
GC-MS, LC-MS/MS)
• Calibration standards for specific analytes
• Controls and internal quality control material
1. Procedure
Sample Preparation:
1. Verify the Chain of Custody documentation for completeness
and accuracy.
2. Log the specimen into the laboratory information system (LIS).
3. Prepare specimen according to SOP using designated
homogenization and extraction procedures specific for
meconium.
Detection and Quantification: 4. Calibration of analytical
instruments:
• Perform initial calibration using standards.
• Conduct quality control checks using positive and negative control
specimens.
1. Load prepared samples into the analyzer.
◦ For GC-MS or LC-MS/MS, ensure correct settings and
calibration.
2. Perform analysis and record raw data from the analyzer.
Result Interpretation: 7. Compare the results to predefined
thresholds for drugs of abuse detection. 8. Utilize dual confirmation
procedures through suitable methodologies (e.g., reanalysis using
secondary method if needed).
1. If any discrepancies arise, consult supervisor and perform
troubleshooting procedures.
2. Quality Control
Internal Quality Control:
• Perform regularly scheduled quality control tests using control
materials provided with the screening kit.
• Document all quality control outcomes in respective logs.
External Quality Control:
• Engage in proficiency testing programs as required by CLIA.
• Document and assess external proficiency testing outcomes.
1. Reporting Results
In-Lab Reporting:
• Verify all results through appropriate checks and document in the
laboratory information system.
• Include details such as method limitations, if any, in the report.
• Ensure proper documentation of all analytical processes including
chain of custody forms.
Critical Results:
• Immediately notify the relevant healthcare provider of any critical
results in accordance with laboratory policy.
• Document the notification process in LIS.
Reference Intervals:
• Reference intervals specific to meconium Drug of Abuse Screen
including thresholds for each specific analyte.
1. Sample Integrity and Troubleshooting
• Perform assessment for sample integrity (e.g., check for signs of
sample degradation).
• If sample integrity is in question, consult with supervisor and
consider necessary analytical or procedural adjustments.
1. References
• Drug of Abuse Screening Kit insert guidelines.
• Internal laboratory protocol documents.
• CLIA guidelines and regulations.
This protocol ensures that the analytical phase of Drug of Abuse
Screen 5, Chain of Custody, Meconium is conducted accurately,
maintaining specimen integrity and compliance with regulatory
standards.
