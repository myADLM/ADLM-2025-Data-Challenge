Standard Operating Procedure: Drugs of Abuse Screen,
Meconium
1. PURPOSE
This protocol provides a standardized procedure for the analytical
phase of generating results for Drugs of Abuse Screen in meconium
samples. The screening is intended to detect the presence of various
drugs and their metabolites in newborns as a part of toxicology
monitoring.
Responsibility:
Designated technologists are responsible for performing the analysis
following the procedures outlined in this protocol. It is the
responsibility of all staff to ensure the accuracy and reliability of test
results and to notify a supervisor in case of any discrepancies or
deviations from the protocol.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/acceptable:
• Meconium samples collected within 24 hours of birth and sent to
the laboratory.
Unacceptable:
• Specimens arriving in the laboratory greater than 72 hours after
collection.
• Specimens without proper labeling (e.g., no collection date/time
indicated on the sample container or requisition).
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Immunoassay analyzer
• LC-MS/MS (Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry/Mass
Spectrometry)
Reagents:
• Drugs of Abuse Screening Kit as specified by the manufacturer
• Control substances for quality control procedures
Supplies:
• Calibration materials
• Sample preparation materials (e.g., extraction solvents, tubes)
1. PROCEDURE
Sample Preparation:
1. Verify the specimen integrity upon receipt and document any
discrepancies.
2. Homogenize the meconium sample to ensure uniformity.
3. Accurately weigh a portion of the homogenized sample as
specified by the screening kit instructions.
4. Extract the drugs/metabolites from the meconium using the
appropriate solvents and techniques provided in the kit
instructions.
5. Prepare the calibration standards and quality controls along
with the samples.
Screening Process:
1. Load the prepared samples, standards, and controls onto the
immunoassay analyzer.
2. Following the analyzer’s protocols for drug screening, run the
samples. Ensure proper documentation of the assay run
including the date, time, and technologist's initials.
Confirmatory Analysis:
1. If the initial immunoassay screen is positive for any drug,
proceed with confirmatory testing using LC-MS/MS.
2. Prepare the positive samples for LC-MS/MS analysis following
extraction and preparation protocols specific to the drugs of
interest.
3. Analyze the samples using LC-MS/MS and document all steps
and results meticulously.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
Internal Quality Control:
1. Run daily quality controls including high and low controls
provided by the manufacturer.
2. Document the control results and ensure they fall within
acceptable limits as per manufacturer's specifications.
3. If quality control results are outside acceptable limits,
troubleshoot according to the manufacturer's guidelines and
notify the supervisor.
External Quality Control:
1. Participate in external proficiency testing as per laboratory
accreditation requirements.
2. Compare inter-laboratory results and address any
discrepancies under the supervision of the quality manager.
3. REPORTING RESULTS
4. Results of the Drugs of Abuse Screen should be reviewed and
verified by the technologist.
5. Positive results from immunoassay screens must be confirmed
by LC-MS/MS before reporting.
6. Results should be entered into the Laboratory Information
System (LIS) with any necessary comments regarding the
integrity or quality of the sample.
7. Notify the attending physician or relevant clinical staff of any
positive results and provide necessary documentation
regarding confirmatory testing.
8. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Refer to manufacturer’s insert for reference intervals specific to the
immunoassay screening kit used.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the manufacturer's Insert for information on limitations
specific to each drug tested in the Drugs of Abuse Screening Kit.
