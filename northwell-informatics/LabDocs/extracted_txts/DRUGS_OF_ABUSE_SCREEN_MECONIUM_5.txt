Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Analytical Phase for DRUGS OF ABUSE SCREEN, MECONIUM
1. PURPOSE:
To provide a standardized procedure for the analytical phase of
generating results for the Drugs of Abuse Screen in Meconium. This
SOP ensures consistency, accuracy, and reliability of test results.
2. SCOPE:
This procedure applies to laboratory personnel trained in the use of
the specified analytical instruments for the Drugs of Abuse Screen in
Meconium.
3. RESPONSIBILITY:
• Laboratory Technologists: Responsible for performing the test
according to this SOP.
• Supervisors: Ensuring compliance with this SOP and addressing
any procedural issues.
4. PROCEDURE:
Equipment and Reagents:
• Analytical Instrument: e.g., Liquid Chromatography-Mass
Spectrometry (LC-MS) or Immunoassay Analyzer
• Control Materials: Negative, Low Positive, and High Positive
Controls
• Calibrators: Drug-specific calibrators depending on the panel
being tested
• Meconium Sample Collection Kit
• Reagents specific for target drugs
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
Specimen Preparation:
• Verify and document specimen integrity as per laboratory
guidelines.
• Record the date and time of specimen receipt.
• Homogenize the meconium sample thoroughly.
• Aliquot approximately 1 gram of homogenized meconium for
testing.
Calibrator and Control Preparation:
• Prepare and label calibrators and control materials as per the
manufacturer’s guidance.
• Run calibrators and controls through the analytical instrument to
ensure proper calibration and instrument performance.
• Validate calibration and control results per established criteria
before proceeding with specimen testing.
Sample Analysis:
1. Extraction:
◦ Weigh an appropriate amount of homogenized meconium
sample.
◦ Add extraction reagent specific to the analytical method
being employed.
◦ Mix samples thoroughly and incubate for a specified time as
per kit instructions.
◦ Centrifuge the samples to obtain a clear supernatant.
2. Analysis:
◦ Transfer the supernatant to the analytical instrument.
◦ Load calibrators, controls, and prepared specimen aliquots.
◦ Follow the instrument’s operational procedure for sample
analysis.
◦ Document all actions in the laboratory log, including date,
time, and initials of the technologist.
Quality Control:
• Run quality control samples at the beginning and end of each
batch of specimens.
• Ensure all control results fall within acceptable ranges before
reporting patient results.
• If QC results are outside acceptable limits, troubleshoot and
resolve issues before proceeding.
• Document all quality control procedures and corrective actions in
the QC log.
Interpreting and Reporting Results:
1. Data Verification:
◦ Review all generated data for accuracy and completeness.
◦ Cross-check that all calibrators, controls, and patient results
are documented.
2. Result Interpretation:
◦ Compare patient results to the established reference
ranges.
◦ Positive results should be confirmed as required by the
laboratory’s verification policy.
3. Reporting:
◦ Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
◦ Ensure critical results are communicated promptly to the
appropriate healthcare provider as per laboratory policy.
◦ Flag results that require confirmation or additional testing.
Reference Intervals:
• Detection limits and cut-offs as defined by the analytical
instrument and specific drug assays being used.
Documentation:
• Maintain all records of calibration, QC, sample processing, and
result entry/verification.
• Keep documentation as per the laboratory’s records retention
policy.
5. REFERENCES:
• Manufacturer’s operation manuals for the LC-MS or
Immunoassay Analyzer.
• Laboratory’s Quality Manual and Compliance Protocols.
• Relevant regulatory guidelines for Drugs of Abuse Testing in
Meconium.
6. REVIEW AND MAINTENANCE:
• This SOP should be reviewed annually or whenever new
techniques, instruments, or reagents are introduced.
• Revisions should be documented, approved, and communicated
to all relevant staff.
