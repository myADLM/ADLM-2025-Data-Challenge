Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Drugs of Abuse Screen,
Serum
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for the analytical phase of generating results
for Drugs of Abuse Screen, Serum in accordance with CLIA
regulations and to ensure the accuracy and reliability of test results.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for
performing the screening and analyzing results as outlined in this
procedure. Supervisors must ensure that laboratory personnel
adhere strictly to this SOP and address any deviations or issues that
arise.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type: Serum
Preferred/Acceptable:
• 3-5 mL of serum collected in a plain red-top tube or serum
separator tube (SST).
• Specimens must be free from hemolysis, lipemia, and icterus.
Unacceptable:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric specimens.
• Specimens with insufficient volume (<1 mL).
Specimen Stability:
• Serum must be separated from cells within 2 hours of collection.
• Specimens are stable for 48 hours at 2-8°C.
• For longer storage, serum samples must be frozen at -20°C or
colder.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Instrumentation:
• Immunoassay analyzer specific for Drugs of Abuse screening
(e.g., Beckman Coulter AU680).
Reagents:
• Drugs of Abuse Screening Reagent Kit (store according to
manufacturer’s instructions).
• Calibrators and Quality Control (QC) materials specific to the
drugs of abuse being screened (store according to manufacturer’s
instructions).
Supplies:
• Serological pipettes or automated pipettors.
• Plain red-top or serum separator tubes.
• Sample cups or sample wells for the analyzer.
1. PROCEDURE
Sample Preparation:
1. Centrifuge serum samples at 1,500-2,000 x g for 10 minutes to
ensure complete separation from cellular components.
2. Transfer the clear serum into clean, appropriately labeled tubes.
Avoid transferring any cellular debris.
Assay Procedure:
1. Ensure the analyzer is calibrated and QC is performed prior to
running patient samples.
2. Load samples into the analyzer sample wells or cups according
to the manufacturer’s instructions.
3. Select the appropriate program or method for Drugs of Abuse
screening on the analyzer.
4. Initiate the assay run as per the analyzer’s operating manual.
5. Monitor the assay run for any instrument flags or error
messages.
Interpretation of Results:
1. Review calibrator and QC results to verify assay performance.
QC results must fall within the manufacturer’s specified ranges.
2. Evaluate patient results against established cutoff
concentrations for each drug of abuse.
3. If the result is above the cutoff, it is considered presumptive
positive. If the result is below the cutoff, it is considered
negative.
4. Presumptive positive results must be confirmed using a more
specific method (e.g., GC-MS or LC-MS/MS).
5. QUALITY CONTROL
6. Perform quality control at the beginning of each shift or every
24 hours, whichever comes first.
7. Use at least two levels of QC material (negative and positive
controls) for each drug of abuse being screened.
8. Record QC results and take necessary corrective actions if QC
results fall outside the acceptable range.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
10. Document all assay results (both numerical values and
qualitative interpretations) in the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
11. For presumptive positive results, add the comment
“Presumptive positive; confirmation required”.
12. Inform the responsible physician or healthcare provider about
any critical or highly unusual results as per laboratory policy.
13. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Negative: Below cutoff concentration Presumptive Positive: At or
above cutoff concentration (Note: Customize cutoff concentrations
according to the laboratory's protocols and guidelines.)
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Cross-reactivity: Some medications or substances may cross-
react with the immunoassay, leading to false positives or
negatives.
• Interference: Hemolysis, lipemia, and icterus may interfere with
the assay performance. Ensure specimens are free from these
interferences.

interpretation.
1. RECORD KEEPING
• Maintain records of all calibrations, QC runs, patient results,
instrument maintenance, and corrective actions in accordance
with CLIA regulations and laboratory policies.
By following this SOP, laboratory personnel can ensure the
generation of accurate and reliable results for Drugs of Abuse
Screen, Serum, thereby supporting effective patient care and clinical
decision-making.
