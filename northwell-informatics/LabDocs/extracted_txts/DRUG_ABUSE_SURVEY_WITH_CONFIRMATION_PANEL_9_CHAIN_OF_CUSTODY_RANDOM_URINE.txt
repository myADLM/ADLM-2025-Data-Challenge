Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Drug Abuse Survey
with Confirmation, Panel 9, Chain of Custody, Random, Urine
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedures for conducting a
Drug Abuse Survey with Confirmation, Panel 9, including chain of
custody protocols for random urine specimens. The focus of this SOP
is on ensuring the accuracy and reliability of results, maintaining the
integrity of the specimens, and adhering to legal and regulatory
requirements.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory staff to follow this
SOP and ensure accurate and reliable results, maintain the integrity
of specimens, and comply with all legal and regulatory requirements.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all urine specimens received in the laboratory
that are to be tested for Drug Abuse Survey with Confirmation, Panel
9, which includes the following substances:
1. Amphetamines
2. Barbiturates
3. Benzodiazepines
4. Cocaine Metabolites
5. Marijuana Metabolites
6. Methadone
7. Opiates
8. Phencyclidine (PCP)
9. Propoxyphene
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen:
• Type: 30-45 mL urine
• Container: Wide-mouth, screw-capped plastic container without
any preservatives
• Stability:
◦ Room temperature (15-25°C): Up to 24 hours from collection
◦ Refrigerated (2-8°C): Up to 72 hours from collection
◦ Frozen (-20°C or colder): Long-term storage
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens with leakage or overt contamination
• Specimens without proper labeling or documentation
• Specimens received beyond the stability time frame
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Urine collection kits with chain of custody forms
• Gloves, goggles, lab coat
• Centrifuge
• Immunoassay analyzer
• Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) or Liquid
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)
• Calibrators and controls for each drug in the panel
• Reagents for immunoassay and confirmatory analysis
• Standard laboratory glassware and pipettes
5. PROCEDURE
A) Chain of Custody:
1. Complete the chain of custody form for each specimen upon
receipt, ensuring the integrity and security of the specimen.
2. Verify that the specimen container is sealed and tamper-
evident.
3. Record the specimen information in the laboratory information
system (LIS) and assign a unique identification number.
B) Initial Screening (Immunoassay):
1. Prepare the immunoassay analyzer by performing necessary
calibrations and quality control checks using standards and
controls.
2. Pour an aliquot (approximately 5 mL) of the urine specimen into
a labeled test tube.
3. Load the test tube onto the immunoassay analyzer according to
the manufacturer’s instructions.
4. Initiate the analysis and wait for the screening results.
5. Record the results in the LIS.
C) Confirmation Testing (GC-MS/LC-MS/MS):
1. For specimens that screened positive, prepare the confirmatory
analysis.
2. Transfer an aliquot (approximately 2 mL) of the screened
positive specimen into a labeled centrifuge tube.
3. Centrifuge the specimen at 1000-2000g for 10 minutes to
remove any particulate matter.
4. Extract the sample and prepare it for analysis using solid-phase
extraction or other suitable methods.
5. Load the extracted sample onto the GC-MS or LC-MS/MS for
confirmatory testing.
6. Run the confirmatory analysis using appropriately validated
methods and controls.
7. Record the confirmed results in the LIS, including both initial
screening and confirmatory results.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run positive and negative controls with each batch of specimens
tested.
• Perform daily calibration verification using standard reference
materials.
• Document all quality control activities in the laboratory record.
• Resolve any out-of-control conditions before continuing with
patient specimen testing.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Verify the results in the LIS and include both initial screening
and confirmatory analysis for specimens that tested positive.
2. Record the results on the chain of custody form and include any
necessary comments or interpretation.
3. Submit the final report to the requesting authority or clinician.
8. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's instructions for immunoassay analyzers and GC-
MS/LC-MS/MS instrumentation.
• Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) regulations.
• Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration
(SAMHSA) guidelines for drug testing.
9. DOCUMENTATION AND REVIEW
• Maintain all records, including chain of custody forms, test results,
and QC logs, according to laboratory policy.
• This SOP should be reviewed annually and updated as necessary
to ensure compliance with regulations and best practices.
By following this SOP, laboratory staff can ensure the reliability and
integrity of Drug Abuse Survey with Confirmation, Panel 9, Chain of
Custody, Random, Urine results, providing accurate and legally
defensible outcomes.
