DRUG ABUSE SURVEY WITH CONFIRMATION, PANEL 9,
RANDOM, URINE
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for the analysis of urine specimens for the
presence of drugs of abuse using immunoassay screening methods
followed by confirmation with Gas Chromatography-Mass
Spectrometry (GC-MS) or Liquid Chromatography-Mass
Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) for positive results.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing the
analysis according to this procedure and ensuring the accuracy and
reliability of the test results. It is the responsibility of all laboratory
staff to maintain quality control and proper documentation throughout
the analytical process.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type:
• Urine
Specimen Collection:
• Random urine specimen in a clean, sterile container with no
preservatives.
• A minimum volume of 30 mL is preferred.
• Specimen must be labeled with patient identification, collection
date, and time.
Specimen Stability:
• Specimens should be stored at 2-8°C if analysis is not
immediately performed.
• Specimens are stable for up to 48 hours at room temperature and
up to 7 days when refrigerated.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens in non-sterile containers.
• Specimens with significant contamination or visible particulate
matter.
• Specimens with non-urine substances added.
• Specimens with improper labeling.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Automated immunoassay analyzer.
• GC-MS or LC-MS/MS equipment.
• Refrigerators (2-8°C).
• Centrifuge.
• Pipettes and tips.
• Specimen cups and transfer devices.
• Analytical balances.
Reagents:
• Certified drug-free urine calibration standards.
• Positive and negative urine control materials.
• Specific immunoassay reagents for each drug in the panel.
• Reagent-grade chemicals for sample preparation (e.g., extraction
solvents).
Supplies:
• Laboratory gloves and PPE.
• Sample tubes and vials.
• Disposable pipette tips.
• Centrifuge tubes.
• Waste disposal containers.
1. ANALYTICAL PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Preparation:
1. Upon receiving the urine specimen, log the sample into the
laboratory information system (LIS) and visually inspect for
suitability.
2. Aliquot 10 mL of the urine specimen into a labeled centrifuge
tube.
3. Centrifuge the specimen at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes to remove
particulate matter.
B. Immunoassay Screening:
1. Load the aliquoted and centrifuged urine specimens onto the
automated immunoassay analyzer.
2. Utilize specific immunoassay kits/reagents for the detection of
the following drugs/metabolites:
◦ Amphetamines/Methamphetamines
◦ Benzodiazepines
◦ Cannabinoids (THC)
◦ Cocaine Metabolite
◦ Methadone
◦ Opiates
◦ Phencyclidine (PCP)
◦ Barbiturates
◦ Propoxyphene
3. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for the operation of the
immunoassay analyzer and interpretation of the results.
4. Record the results from the immunoassay screening.
C. Confirmatory Testing (GC-MS or LC-MS/MS):
1. For specimens that test positive on the immunoassay
screening, proceed to confirmatory testing.
2. Prepare the specimen extracts using solid-phase extraction
(SPE) or liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) techniques.
3. Dry down the extracts and reconstitute in an appropriate
solvent.
4. Inject the prepared extracts into the GC-MS or LC-MS/MS
instrument.
5. Perform the analysis according to the standard operating
procedure for the confirmatory test.
6. Compare the results with certified drug standards to confirm the
presence and concentration of the drugs.
7. Document the results and verify against quality control
materials.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
A. Internal Quality Control:
1. Run positive and negative control samples with each batch of
specimens.
2. Ensure all controls fall within the established range before
proceeding with specimen analysis.
3. Document all quality control results and actions taken for any
out-of-control results.
B. Instrument Calibration:
1. Calibrate the immunoassay analyzer and confirmatory
instrument according to manufacturer recommendations.
2. Use certified calibration standards for each drug/metabolite in
the panel.
3. Document calibration procedures and maintain calibration
records.
4. REPORTING RESULTS
A. Result Interpretation:
1. Report results of the immunoassay screening and confirmatory
tests.
2. Positive results reported only if both screening and confirmatory
tests are positive.
3. Include specific drug/metabolite detected, concentration, and
interpretation of the result.
B. Documentation:
1. Ensure all results, including both screening and confirmatory,
are entered into the LIS.
2. Retain detailed records of testing procedures, quality control
data, and instrument maintenance.
C. Communication:
1. Notify the appropriate clinician or designated personnel of any
positive results following the confirmatory test.
2. Consult with medical review officer (MRO) if required for
interpretation and clinical relevance.
