Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Drug Immunoassay Panel,
Urine
1. PURPOSE
This procedure defines the method for the analysis of drug
immunoassay panel in urine specimens using the appropriate
immunoassay techniques. It ensures accurate and reliable results for
the detection and quantification of specific drugs or drug metabolites.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all clinical laboratory staff involved in the
analytical phase of processing urine specimens for drug
immunoassay panel testing.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
All designated laboratory personnel are responsible for adhering to
this SOP. Quality control is monitored by supervisory staff, and any
deviations or discrepancies must be reported to the supervisor for
corrective action.
4. DEFINITIONS
• Drug Immunoassay: A biochemical test that measures the
presence or concentration of drugs or drug metabolites using
antigen-antibody reactions.
• Specimen: Urine sample collected from the patient for analysis.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Automated immunoassay analyzer (i.e., Beckman Coulter, Roche,
Siemens)
• Specific reagents and drug detection kits compatible with the
analyzer
• Quality control materials (positive and negative controls)
• Urine collection containers
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
6. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Requirements:
• Preferred Specimen: 10 mL of freshly voided urine collected in a
clean, properly labeled container, within 8 hours of collection.
• Specimen Stability: Store at 2-8°C if analysis will be delayed
beyond 8 hours after collection. Urine samples are stable for up to
48 hours when refrigerated.
B. Sample Preparation:
1. Verify that the urine specimen has been properly labeled and
stored.
2. Allow refrigerated specimens to reach room temperature before
analysis.
3. Mix the specimen thoroughly by gently inverting the container.
C. Analyzer Preparation:
1. Ensure the immunoassay analyzer is properly calibrated and
maintained according to the manufacturer's instructions.
2. Load the appropriate reagent kits and quality control materials
onto the analyzer.
3. Perform a system check and ensure there are no error
messages and all required reagents are available.
D. Running the Test:
1. Load the urine specimens onto the analyzer securely in the
specimen rack or auto-loader.
2. Input the specimen identification numbers into the analyzer
system.
3. Select the appropriate drug immunoassay panel program from
the analyzer's menu.
4. Start the analysis run and monitor the process for any error
messages or alerts.
E. Quality Control:
1. Run positive and negative controls at the beginning of each
shift or every 24 hours, and whenever a new reagent kit is put
into use.
2. Document all control results in the Quality Control Log.
3. If control results fall outside the established limits, troubleshoot
per the manufacturer's instructions and repeat the control run.
F. Result Review and Reporting:
1. Once the analysis is complete, review the generated results for
each specimen.
2. Verify that the results are within the expected ranges and check
for any flags or alerts.
3. Any abnormal or critical results should be reviewed by a
supervisor.
4. Enter the verified results into the Laboratory Information
System (LIS) for reporting.
5. Notify the appropriate healthcare provider of any critical results
immediately per laboratory protocol.
G. Troubleshooting:
1. If an error occurs during the run, refer to the analyzer's
troubleshooting guide.
2. Repeat the analysis run for any specimens affected by the
error.
3. Document any troubleshooting steps and corrective actions
taken.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform quality control checks as specified in the procedure.
• Document any deviations and corrective actions in the Quality
Control Log.
• Review quality control data regularly to ensure analyzer
performance.
8. RECORD KEEPING
• Maintain records of all specimen analyses, including timestamps,
operator identification, and any corrective actions taken.
• Keep quality control logs and maintenance records according to
laboratory policy.
9. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's instructions for the specific immunoassay analyzer
and reagent kits used.
• Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines for
urine drug testing.
