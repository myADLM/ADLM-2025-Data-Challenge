Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for DRUG SCREEN, PRESCRIPTION/OVER
THE COUNTER, CHAIN OF CUSTODY, RANDOM, URINE
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the steps required for the
analytical phase of generating results for urine drug screen testing,
including prescription and over-the-counter drugs. This document
ensures consistency and accuracy in the testing process while
maintaining the integrity of the chain of custody.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all designated laboratory personnel responsible
for the analysis of urine specimens received for drug screening
purposes. This includes handling chain of custody cases and random
drug screenings.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for following this
protocol precisely to ensure accurate results. It is the responsibility of
all involved staff to maintain the integrity of the chain of custody and
report any issues immediately to a supervisor.
4. DEFINITIONS
• Drug Screen: Analytical procedure for detecting the presence of
drugs in urine.
• Chain of Custody: A process ensuring that the specimen has
been collected, transferred, tested, and recorded under secure
conditions.
5. PROCEDURE
5.1 Specimen Handling and Preparation
1. Specimen Reception: Confirm the specimen has been
properly collected, labeled, and accessioned. Verify that chain
of custody documentation is intact.
2. Storage: Store specimens at 2–8°C if not analyzed
immediately. Ensure that the storage area is secure and access
is limited to authorized personnel.
5.2 Specimen Validity Testing
1. Physical Examination: Inspect the specimen for color, clarity,
volume, and any signs of tampering.
2. Adulteration Testing: Perform tests for creatinine, pH, specific
gravity, oxidizing agents, and temperature at the time of
collection.
5.3 Analytical Testing
1. Instrumentation: Use immunoassay analyzers or mass
spectrometry as per manufacturer’s recommendations.
2. Calibration: Calibrate instruments at the beginning of each
shift using control materials provided by the manufacturer.
3. Quality Control: Run quality control samples at the beginning,
middle, and end of each batch. Ensure results fall within
expected ranges before proceeding.
5.4 Immunoassay Screening Procedure
1. Aliquoting: Aliquot the urine sample into the test cup.
2. Loading Samples: Load the aliquots and calibrators into the
analyzer.
3. Running the Assay: Start the run according to the analyzer’s
operational procedure.
4. Reading Results: Interpret the screen results. Positive results
require confirmation by a more specific method like GC-MS or
LC-MS/MS.
5.5 Confirmation Testing (if applicable)
1. Sample Preparation: Prepare samples identified as
presumptive positive. This includes steps like hydrolysis, solid-
phase extraction, and/or liquid-liquid extraction.
2. GC-MS/LC-MS/MS Testing: Perform confirmation testing as
per validated methods.
3. Data Interpretation: Compare obtained results against cut-off
concentrations to confirm the presence of drugs.
5.6 Chain of Custody Samples
1. Documentation: Complete and maintain chain of custody
forms throughout the testing process.
2. Secure Storage: Store chain of custody specimens in locked,
restricted-access storage until they are returned or destroyed.
5.7 Result Verification
1. Review: Ensure that a designated technologist reviews the test
results for accuracy.
2. Reporting: Report results through the laboratory information
system (LIS). For confirmed positives, document according to
the chain of custody requirements.
3. Critical Results: Notify the ordering physician or designated
contact person immediately if critical levels are detected.
5.8 Post-Analysis Handling
1. Specimen Storage: Store tested specimens at 2-8°C for at
least one week post-analysis unless instructed otherwise.
2. Documentation: Ensure all analysis documentation and chain
of custody forms are appropriately filed and stored.
6. Quality Control
1. Internal Quality Controls: Follow bi-weekly and monthly
internal quality control checks as per established schedules.
2. External Proficiency Testing: Participate in external
proficiency testing (EPT) programs to maintain accreditation.
7. Reporting Results and Documentation
1. Auto-verification: Ensure immediate transmission of results to
the LIS for cases not requiring confirmation.
2. Manual Verification: Validate all positive results manually
before reporting.
3. Documentation: Maintain detailed records of all analytical
steps, QC actions, and corrective measures taken.
8. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Reference intervals vary by drug class and must be consulted from
respective drug panel inserts or standard reference guides.
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the specific test kit and instrumentation manuals for any
limitations regarding sensitivity, specificity, and cross-reactivity.
10. REFERENCES
Refer to instrumentation manuals, test kit inserts, and laboratory
internal protocols for a comprehensive guide on procedures and
limitations.
