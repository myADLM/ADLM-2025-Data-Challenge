Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for DRUG SCREEN,
PRESCRIPTION/OVER THE COUNTER, RANDOM, URINE
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to define the procedure for the analytical
phase in generating results for drug screening of prescription or over-
the-counter (OTC) medications in a random urine specimen. This
procedure ensures accurate, reliable, and timely results necessary
for patient care and treatment decisions.
Responsibility:
All laboratory staff involved in the analytical phase of urine drug
screen testing must adhere to this SOP. It is the responsibility of all
staff to ensure that testing is performed accurately and results are
reported promptly and correctly.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to random urine specimens collected for screening
of prescription and over-the-counter drugs in the laboratory.
3. DEFINITIONS
• Random Urine Specimen: A urine sample collected at an
unspecified time without prior scheduling.
• Drug Screen: A test used to detect the presence of one or more
drugs or their metabolites.
4. PROCEDURE
4.1 Specimen Requirements
• Preferred/Acceptable Specimens:
◦ Random urine specimens collected in a sterile, leak-proof
container.
• Unacceptable Specimens:
◦ Specimens arriving without proper labeling.
◦ Specimens showing signs of tampering or contamination.
4.2 Reagents and Supplies
• Immunoassay reagents for the detection of drugs and their
metabolites
• Control material, negative and positive controls
• Sterile, leak-proof containers
• Pipettes and respective pipette tips
• Urine drug screening system (e.g., analyzer, strips)
4.3 Analytical Procedure
1. Sample Preparation:
◦ Ensure the specimen is at room temperature before
analysis.
◦ Mix the urine sample well by gentle inversion.
2. Calibrators and Controls:
◦ Prepare and run external quality control material and
calibrators according to manufacturer’s instructions for each
batch of tests.
◦ Document the results of calibrators and controls on the
control log.
3. System/Instrument Setup:
◦ Verify that the analyzer is functioning properly and is within
calibration.
◦ Check that all required reagents are available, not expired,
and properly stored.
4. Testing:
◦ Administer the urine sample to the designated testing
system (e.g., analyzer, immunoassay strip) as per the
manufacturer instructions.
◦ Follow specific steps for the analyzer, including entering the
sample information, assigning the sample ID, and initiating
the testing process.
5. Result Interpretation:
◦ Review the results for each specified drug or metabolite.
◦ Compare the color change or readings to the reference
chart or system-provided criteria.
◦ Positive results indicate the presence of drugs or their
metabolites at or above the cut-off concentrations.
6. Documentation:
◦ Document each test result in the laboratory information
system (LIS).
◦ Record any deviations or issues and the corresponding
corrective actions taken on the test run log.
4.4 Quality Control
• Perform quality control testing at the beginning of each shift, with
each new reagent lot, and any time the system or analytical
process is in doubt.
• Acceptable quality control results are required before patient
sample analysis.
• Document all quality control results and any corrective actions if
out-of-range results are encountered.
4.5 Reporting Results
• Results are reviewed and verified by the technologist.
• Results are transmitted to the LIS and reported according to site-
specific guidelines.
• Any critical results or unexpected positives must be
communicated immediately to the requesting clinician following
the critical result notification policy.
4.6 Method Limitations
• Refer to the package insert or the analyzer’s user manual for
detailed limitations of the testing system.
• Certain substances or conditions may cause interference with test
results.
