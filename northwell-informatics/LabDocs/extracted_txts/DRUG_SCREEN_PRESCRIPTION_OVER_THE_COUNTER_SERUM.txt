Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Analytical Phase for Drug
Screen of Prescription/Over-the-Counter (OTC) Medications in
Serum
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the analysis of serum
samples for the presence of prescription and over-the-counter (OTC)
medications. This ensures accurate, reliable, and reproducible results
using approved methodologies.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
Qualified laboratory personnel are responsible for performing the
drug screening analysis according to this SOP. It is the responsibility
of the personnel to adhere to protocol guidelines, maintain the
instruments, and ensure quality control measures are executed
appropriately.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred Specimen:
• Serum collected in a plain red-top tube.
• Minimum volume: 2 mL of serum.
• Specimens must be processed and separated within 2 hours of
collection.
Storage and Stability:
• Serum specimens should be tested within 24 hours if stored at
room temperature (20-25°C).
• If testing will be delayed, specimens should be refrigerated
(2-8°C) for up to 72 hours. For longer storage, serum specimens
should be frozen at -20°C or lower.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) or Gas
Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) systems.
• Control standards for each drug to be screened, including both
positive and negative controls.
• Calibration curves for each drug.
• Reagents for sample preparation, including solvents and
extraction materials.
• Centrifuge.
• Pipettes and pipette tips.
• Glassware (test tubes, vials).
• Personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves, lab coat,
and safety glasses.
5. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation:
1. Centrifuge the serum sample at 2,000-3,000 rpm for 10 minutes
to ensure separation of serum from cells.
2. Transfer 1 mL of the clear supernatant into a clean glass vial.
3. If necessary, dilute the serum sample according to the method
requirements.
4. Add internal standard and vortex the mixture for 30 seconds.
B. Extraction:
1. For HPLC:
◦ Use a liquid-liquid extraction method as detailed in the
method's SOP.
◦ Alternatively, use solid-phase extraction (SPE) cartridges
following the manufacturer's instructions.
2. For GC-MS:
◦ Perform liquid-liquid extraction using a suitable organic
solvent.
◦ Dry the organic phase under nitrogen at room temperature.
◦ Reconstitute the residue in an appropriate volume of solvent
(e.g., methanol) and transfer it to an autosampler vial.
C. Instrument Setup:
1. Ensure the HPLC or GC-MS system is calibrated and all
maintenance records are up to date.
2. Prepare the instrument by loading calibration standards and
quality control samples.
3. Set the appropriate method parameters, including the detection
wavelengths and run time for HPLC, or ion source parameters
and temperature gradient for GC-MS.
D. Analysis:
1. Load the prepared samples, calibration standards, and quality
control samples into the instrument autosampler.
2. Start the analysis and monitor the system for any alerts or
errors during the run.
3. Ensure that each analytical batch includes at least one blank
sample, negative control, and positive control.
E. Data Analysis & Reporting:
1. Validate the calibration curve before analyzing the unknown
samples:
◦ Confirm that the calibration curve for each analyte shows
acceptable linearity (R^2 ≥ 0.99).
2. Apply the calibration curve to quantify the analytes in the serum
samples.
3. Review the chromatograms and mass spectra to confirm the
presence or absence of the targeted drugs.
4. Compare the retention times and spectra of the sample peaks
to those of the calibration standards.
5. Identify and quantify the drugs present in the serum samples.
6. Document the results in the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
6. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Run quality control samples at the beginning and end of each
batch to ensure system performance.
2. Include at least one positive and one negative control in each
batch.
3. Ensure that all results fall within the acceptable range for the
controls before proceeding with sample analysis.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Results are automatically transmitted to LIS and must be
reviewed by a certified technologist.
2. Report any detected drugs with their quantified concentrations
in the final report.
3. In case of any anomalous results or quality control failures,
follow the troubleshooting steps and reprocess the affected
samples if necessary.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
1. Apart from the primary targeted drugs, interference from other
compounds can affect accurate identification and quantification.
2. Ensure proper sample handling to prevent contamination.
3. Any limitations specific to the analytical methods used should
be referred to in the instrument SOPs.
