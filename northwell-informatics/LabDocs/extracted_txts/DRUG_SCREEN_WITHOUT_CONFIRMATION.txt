Standard Operating Procedure: Analytical Phase of Generating
Results for DRUG SCREEN WITHOUT CONFIRMATION
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is to
provide detailed instructions for generating results for a Drug Screen
Without Confirmation in the laboratory. This protocol ensures the
accuracy, reliability, and consistency of test results by adhering to
proper analytical procedures.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory personnel to follow
this SOP and ensure all steps are performed accurately. Any
deviations from the SOP must be documented and reported to a
supervisor.
3. MATERIALS REQUIRED
• Drug screening immunoassay analyzer
• Calibrators and Quality Control (QC) materials
• Reagent kits specific for the drug screening test
• Disposable pipettes or automated pipetting system
• Negative and positive control samples
• Logbooks and result reporting sheets
• Appropriate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Acceptable specimens: Urine samples collected in sterile
containers.
• Reject criteria: Specimens with visible contamination, incorrect
labeling, inappropriate storage conditions, or insufficient volume.
5. ANALYTICAL PROCEDURE
Step 1: Preparation
1.1 Ensure the immunoassay analyzer is calibrated and ready for use
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
1.2 Check that all reagents, calibrators, and controls are within their
expiration dates and stored at the recommended temperature.
1.3 Wear appropriate PPE, including lab coat, gloves, and safety
glasses.
Step 2: Specimen Handling
2.1 Verify that specimens are properly labeled with the patient's
information.
2.2 Mix the urine specimens gently to ensure homogeneity before
aliquoting.
2.3 Record the receipt and processing of specimens in the laboratory
logbook.
Step 3: Calibration and Quality Control
3.1 Run calibrators to establish the standard curve for the assay.
Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for calibration procedures.
3.2 Perform QC tests using negative and positive controls to validate
the assay's accuracy and reliability.
3.3 Document the results of calibrators and QC tests in the logbook.
Ensure QC results fall within the acceptable range before proceeding
with patient samples.
Step 4: Analyzing Specimens
4.1 Load specimen aliquots into the sample rack of the immunoassay
analyzer.
4.2 Program the analyzer with the appropriate assay parameters for
the drug screen without confirmation.
4.3 Start the analysis process and monitor the analyzer to ensure it is
functioning properly throughout the assay run.
Step 5: Result Interpretation and Documentation
5.1 Upon completion of the analysis, retrieve and review the results
generated by the immunoassay analyzer.
5.2 Verify that control results are within the limits to confirm the
validity of the test run.
5.3 Document the results in the laboratory information system (LIS)
or appropriate reporting sheets.
Step 6: Reporting Results
6.1 Review the results to ensure accuracy and completeness.
6.2 For any results flagged by the system (potential interferences or
inconsistencies), repeat the analysis for verification.
6.3 Report the final validated results according to the site-specific
reporting guidelines.
6. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Drug screens performed without confirmation are preliminary and
may have potential for false positives or false negatives. Specific
interfering substances can affect the accuracy of the immunoassay.
Positive results should be followed up with confirmatory testing via
more specific methodologies like GC-MS (Gas Chromatography-
Mass Spectrometry).
7. QUALITY CONTROL
Routine quality control protocols must be adhered to, including:
• Running QC samples with each batch of patient specimens.
• Documenting all QC activities and results.
• Investigating and resolving any QC failures before releasing
patient results.
8. MAINTENANCE AND TROUBLESHOOTING
Regular maintenance of the immunoassay analyzer should be
performed as per the manufacturer’s instructions. Any technical
issues encountered during the analysis should be documented, and
the manufacturer or technical support should be contacted if
necessary.
9. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s guidelines and product inserts for the
immunoassay analyzer.
• Internal laboratory documentation regarding quality control
procedures and reporting guidelines.
This SOP is effective from the date of issue and will be reviewed
annually or as needed based on regulatory and operational updates.
