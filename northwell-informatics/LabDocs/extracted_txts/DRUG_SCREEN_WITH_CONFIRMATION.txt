SOP: Analytical Phase Protocol for DRUG SCREEN WITH
CONFIRMATION
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the analytical phase of
generating results for a drug screen with confirmation. This protocol
ensures that test results are accurate, reliable, and adhere to all
regulatory and accreditation standards.
Responsibility:
• It is the responsibility of the designated staff to perform drug
screening and confirmation analysis, document results, and follow
up with appropriate next steps.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring that the procedures are
followed and that any deviations or issues are addressed
promptly.
1. DEFINITION
A drug screen includes the preliminary analysis of a specimen to
identify the presence of one or more drugs or their metabolites.
Confirmation involves using a secondary, more specific technique to
confirm and quantify the presence of the identified substances.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation
• Ensure that the sample (urine, blood, oral fluid, etc.) has been
collected, labeled, and accessioned correctly.
• If the specimen is refrigerated, bring it to room temperature before
analysis.
B. Initial Drug Screen
1. Equipment and Materials:
◦ Immunoassay analyzer
◦ Calibrators and controls
◦ Drug screening reagents (e.g., enzyme immunoassay kits)
◦ Pipettes and tips
◦ Sample cups or tubes
2. Procedure:
◦ Perform daily instrument calibration using calibrators
provided by the reagent manufacturer.
◦ Run quality control (QC) samples (positive and negative
controls) before proceeding with patient samples. Document
QC results.
◦ Aliquot the required volume of the specimen into a sample
cup or tube.
◦ Load specimens, calibrators, and controls into the analyzer
according to the manufacturer's instructions.
◦ Start the analysis process as per the instrument's standard
operating procedures (SOP).
3. Interpretation of Results:
◦ Review the results produced by the immunoassay analyzer.
◦ Any result above the cutoff value for a particular drug group
is considered presumptive positive.
C. Confirmation of Positive Drug Screens
1. Equipment and Materials:
◦ Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) or
Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-
MS/MS)
◦ Calibrators and controls specific to GC-MS or LC-MS/MS
◦ Drug confirmation reagents
◦ Sample preparation supplies (e.g., extraction columns,
solvents, etc.)
2. Procedure:
◦ Confirm positive results using GC-MS or LC-MS/MS
following manufacturer and laboratory SOPs.
◦ Prepare calibration curves using known drug standards.
◦ Run QC samples alongside patient samples to ensure
accuracy (level-specific controls).
◦ Aliquot the necessary volume of presumptive positive
specimens.
◦ Perform sample extraction and purification as required (e.g.,
solid-phase extraction, liquid-liquid extraction).
◦ Inject prepared samples into the GC-MS or LC-MS/MS.
◦ Analyze data and compare sample peaks to those of
standards.
3. Interpretation of Results:
◦ Confirm the presence of drugs/metabolites by comparing
retention times and mass spectra against those of known
standards.
◦ Quantify the concentrations of confirmed drugs/metabolites
using the calibration curve.
D. Reporting Results
• Review and verify all results before reporting. Ensure that both
initial screening and confirmation analysis are complete.
• Document results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
along with any relevant comments (e.g., any deviations or notes
on sample integrity).
• For positive confirmation results, ensure that confirmation data
(e.g., retention time, mass spectra) are attached to the report.
E. Quality Control and Maintenance
• Perform routine instrument maintenance as per the
manufacturer's guidelines.
• Regularly schedule proficiency testing and external quality
assessments to ensure ongoing accuracy and reliability.
• Document all maintenance and QC activities.
F. Sample Integrity and Result Documentation
• Maintain a log of all samples, including sample accession
numbers, dates, times, and analyst initials.
• Ensure sample integrity by verifying no post-collection
contamination or degradation.
• Clearly document any issues affecting sample processing or
result interpretation.
