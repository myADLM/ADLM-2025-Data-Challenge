Standard Operating Procedure for Duchenne/Becker Muscular
Dystrophy, DMD Gene, Large Deletion/Duplication Analysis,
VARIES
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline a standardized protocol for the
analytical phase of generating results for Duchenne/Becker Muscular
Dystrophy (DMD), specifically targeting large deletions/duplications in
the DMD gene. This protocol ensures the accuracy, reliability, and
consistency of test results.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all personnel involved in the genetic analysis and
reporting of DMD gene large deletion/duplication assays in the
laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Designated Staff: Responsible for performing the genetic
analysis, documenting results, and ensuring adherence to this
SOP.
• Supervisors: Responsible for reviewing and validating test
results, overseeing staff adherence to protocols, and addressing
any issues or deviations identified during the process.
4. DEFINITIONS
• DMD: Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy
• BMD: Becker Muscular Dystrophy
• MLPA: Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification
• CNV: Copy Number Variation
5. PROCEDURE
A) Pre-analytical Phase
1. Specimen Confirmation:
◦ Confirm receipt and proper labeling of the specimen, which
includes the patient’s name, ID, date of collection, and type
of specimen (e.g., blood, saliva, or tissue).
◦ Verify that specimens are suitable for analysis based on pre-
analytical criteria (specimen integrity, correct collection
method, etc.).
2. Storage and Preparation:
◦ Store the specimens at appropriate temperatures until
processing (e.g., DNA extracted and stored at -20°C or
lower).
◦ Follow the standard protocol for DNA extraction,
quantification, and quality assessment.
B) Analytical Phase
1. MLPA or CNV Analysis:
◦ Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification
(MLPA):
1. Reagents and Materials:
▪ MLPA probe mix specific for the DMD gene.
▪ Thermal cycler, electrophoresis equipment, and
reagents (e.g., appropriate polymerase, buffers).
2. Procedure:
▪ Perform the MLPA reaction as per the
manufacturer's instructions, including probe
hybridization, ligation, and amplification steps.
▪ Analyze the amplified products using capillary
electrophoresis.
3. Data Analysis:
▪ Use appropriate software (e.g., Coffalyser.Net) for
interpretation of peak patterns.
▪ Compare peak areas/ratios to control specimens to
determine the presence of deletions or
duplications.
◦ Copy Number Variation (CNV) Analysis via qPCR or
NGS:
1. Reagents and Materials:
▪ qPCR or NGS reagents and equipment as
applicable.
2. Procedure and Data Analysis:
▪ Follow standard protocols for qPCR or NGS CNV
analysis.
▪ Validate results using appropriate bioinformatics
tools and software.
2. Quality Control:
◦ Internal Controls: Run known positive and negative
controls alongside patient samples to ensure the accuracy
of the assay.
◦ Blanks: Include no-template controls in MLPA or CNV
assays to check for contamination.
3. Result Interpretation:
◦ Carefully interpret raw data for the presence of large
deletions/duplications in the DMD gene.
◦ Cross-check findings with molecular databases and relevant
literature to confirm known pathogenic variants.
C) Post-analytical Phase
1. Review and Validation:
◦ Have a secondary reviewer (qualified geneticist or
pathologist) verify the interpretation of results.
◦ Confirm that all controls performed as expected.
2. Reporting:
◦ Document findings in the Laboratory Information System
(LIS) or designated reporting software.
◦ Generate a comprehensive report that includes:
▪ Patient details.
▪ Summary of the analysis performed.
▪ Detailed interpretation of results.
▪ Recommendations for further testing or genetic
counseling if required.
3. Archiving:
◦ Store all raw data, electropherograms, and reports as per
laboratory retention policies.
◦ Maintain confidentiality and data security during storage.
6. TROUBLESHOOTING
• Low Signal or Amplification Failure:
◦ Review sample quality and concentration.
◦ Repeat MLPA or CNV analysis with diluted or re-extracted
DNA if necessary.
◦ Ensure all reagents and equipment function correctly.
• Non-specific Amplification or Artifacts:
◦ Reassess reagents for contamination.
◦ Perform the assay with fresh reagents and clean equipment.

8. REVIEW AND REVISION
• This SOP will be reviewed annually or as needed to incorporate
new technologies or methodological improvements.
• Document any revisions in the SOP control log.
9. DOCUMENTATION
• Log all test runs and validations in the Temperature Monitoring
Log, including dates, times, and staff initials.
• Maintain detailed records of all samples, controls, and analysis
results in laboratory management systems.
