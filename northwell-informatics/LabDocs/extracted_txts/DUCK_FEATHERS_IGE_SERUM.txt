Analytical Phase SOP for Measuring DUCK
FEATHERS IgE in Serum
1. Purpose
The purpose of this Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is to
describe the steps for measuring the immunoglobulin E (IgE) specific
to duck feathers in serum samples using immunoassay techniques.
This protocol ensures consistent, accurate, and reproducible results,
which are critical in the diagnosis and management of allergic
conditions related to duck feather exposure.
2. Scope
This SOP applies to laboratory staff trained in performing
immunoassay testing for allergen-specific IgE antibodies using the
specified instrumentation and methods in a CLIA-certified laboratory
environment.
3. Definitions
• IgE: Immunoglobulin E, a class of antibody associated with
allergic reactions.
• Immunoassay: A laboratory technique used to measure antigen-
antibody interactions and quantify specific proteins, in this case,
allergen-specific IgE.
4. Equipment and Reagents
• Microplate reader or automated immunoassay analyzer
• Pipettes and tips (calibrated)
• Duck feathers IgE reagent kit
• Calibration standards
• Quality control materials
• Patient serum samples
• Distilled/deionized water
• Wash buffers
• Substrate solutions
• Stop solutions
5. Procedure
5.1 Preparation
1. Verify that calibrations for pipettes and microplate reader/
analyzer are up to date.
2. Assemble all necessary reagents and materials.
3. Allow all reagents and patient serum samples to equilibrate to
room temperature before use.
5.2 Calibration and Quality Control
1. Perform instrument calibration using the standards provided in
the reagent kit.
2. Run quality control materials at two levels (high and low IgE)
before patient sample testing to ensure assay performance.
3. Document calibration and QC results in the logbook.
5.3 Patient Sample Preparation
1. Verify patient identification and sample integrity.
2. Centrifuge serum samples at 1500 x g for 10 minutes to remove
cellular debris.
3. Label tubes clearly with patient information.
5.4 Assay Procedure
1. Prepare the microplate following the instructions in the reagent
kit.
2. Thoroughly mix each patient serum sample and controls.
3. Pipette a fixed volume of each patient sample, standard, and
control into designated wells.
◦ Use a new pipette tip for each sample to avoid cross-
contamination.
4. Add appropriate volumes of reagents (e.g., conjugate,
substrate) as specified in the kit’s instructions.
5. Incubate the microplate as per the recommended conditions
(time and temperature).
6. Wash the microplate wells after each incubation step using the
wash buffer supplied in the kit.
7. Add the substrate solution to each well and incubate for the
recommended period.
8. Add the stop solution to each well to halt the reaction.
5.5 Reading and Interpreting Results
1. Measure the absorbance of each well using the microplate
reader set to the wavelength specified in the kit instructions.
2. Calculate the IgE concentration for each patient sample by
comparing the absorbance values to the standard curve
obtained from the calibrators.
3. Record and review results for accuracy and consistency.
6. Reporting Results
1. Document all results in the appropriate format as defined by
laboratory guidelines.
2. Review and verify results before releasing them into the
Laboratory Information System (LIS).
3. Report critical values promptly to the requesting physician,
following the laboratory's critical value policy.
7. Quality Control and Assurance
1. Perform routine maintenance and calibration of equipment as
per manufacturer's recommendations.
2. Adhere to internal quality control procedures and external
proficiency testing to ensure the reliability of results.
3. Investigate and document any out-of-range quality control
results, taking appropriate corrective actions as needed.
8. Safety and Waste Disposal
1. Follow all laboratory safety protocols, including the use of
personal protective equipment (PPE).
2. Dispose of biohazardous waste, including used reagents and
patient samples, according to biohazard disposal regulations.
