1. PURPOSE
This document outlines the procedure for the analytical phase of
generating results for Duck Meat Immunoglobulin E (IgE) in patient
serum samples. The purpose of this procedure is to ensure accurate
and reliable testing for the presence of IgE antibodies specific to duck
meat, which will assist healthcare providers in diagnosing allergies
related to this allergen.
1. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all clinical laboratory personnel trained and
authorized to perform IgE testing for duck meat allergy in the
laboratory.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of designated laboratory staff to carry out the
procedures as outlined and to ensure adherence to quality control
measures. Laboratory supervisors are responsible for ensuring that
staff are trained and that the equipment is maintained and calibrated.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
◦ Specimen type: Serum
◦ Collection volume: Minimum 1 mL of serum.
◦ Specimen stability: Serum samples must be stored
refrigerated at 2-8°C and may be stored for up to 7 days.
For long-term storage, freeze serum samples at -20°C or
colder.
2. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
◦ ELISA plate reader
◦ Microcentrifuge
◦ Pipettes and tips
◦ Incubator
◦ Plate washer
◦ Duck Meat IgE ELISA kit (from a certified supplier)
◦ Calibrators and controls (positive and negative)
◦ Laboratory timer
◦ Personal protective equipment (PPE)
3. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation
1. Thaw serum samples at room temperature if frozen.
2. Mix samples gently using a vortex mixer.
B. Assay Preparation
1. Set up the ELISA plate according to the manufacturer's instructions included in the Duck Meat IgE ELISA kit.
2. Add 100 µL of calibrators, controls, and patient serum samples to the designated wells.
3. Seal the plate with adhesive film and incubate at 37°C for 60 minutes.
C. Washing
1. Remove the adhesive film and wash the wells 5 times with the wash buffer provided in the kit using an automated plate washer or manual wash method.
2. Tap the plate on absorbent paper to remove any remaining wash buffer.
D. Conjugate Reaction
1. Add 100 µL of enzyme-conjugated anti-IgE antibody to each well.
2. Seal the plate with adhesive film and incubate at 37°C for 30 minutes.
E. Washing
1. Remove the adhesive film and wash the wells 5 times with the wash buffer as before.
2. Tap the plate on absorbent paper to remove any remaining wash buffer.
F. Substrate Reaction
1. Add 100 µL of substrate solution to each well.
2. Incubate the plate at room temperature in the dark for 20 minutes.
G. Stopping the Reaction
1. Add 50 µL of stop solution to each well to terminate the reaction.
2. Gently tap the plate to mix the contents.
H. Reading the Plate
1. Read the absorbance of each well at 450 nm using an ELISA plate reader.
2. Record the absorbance values for all wells.
4. CALCULATIONS AND INTERPRETATION
1. Calculate the mean absorbance for duplicate wells of
calibrators, controls, and patient samples.
2. Generate a standard curve using the calibrator
absorbance values.
3. Determine the IgE concentration for each patient sample
by interpolating its absorbance from the standard curve.
4. Report results using the established reference intervals.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Include positive and negative controls in each assay run.
2. Review control results to ensure they fall within the
specified range.
3. If controls are outside acceptable limits, investigate and
resolve the issue before releasing patient results.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Report Duck Meat IgE results in kU/L (kilounits per liter).
2. Refer to site-specific guidelines for reporting and critical
value handling.
7. METHOD LIMITATIONS
1. Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples may interfere with
assay results.
2. Cross-reactivity with other allergens can lead to false
positives.
3. Local limitations and interferences specific to the patient
population or geographical region should be considered.
