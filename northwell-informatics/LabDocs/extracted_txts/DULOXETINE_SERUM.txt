Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analyzing
Duloxetine in Serum
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for analyzing the concentration of Duloxetine
in serum samples.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all personnel responsible for performing
Duloxetine serum level analysis.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for following this
procedure to ensure accurate and reliable measurement of
Duloxetine levels in serum. It is the responsibility of supervisory staff
to ensure compliance with the procedure and to address any issues
that arise.
4. PRINCIPLE
Duloxetine is a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI)
used in the treatment of major depressive disorder and generalized
anxiety disorder. Accurate measurement of Duloxetine levels in
serum is crucial for therapeutic drug monitoring.
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Type of Specimen:
• Serum
Sample Collection:
• Blood should be drawn using standard venipuncture techniques.
• Allow the blood to clot at room temperature and then centrifuge
promptly to separate the serum.
• Transfer the serum into a clean, appropriately labeled tube.
Specimen Stability:
• Serum samples should be analyzed within 48 hours of collection if
stored at 2-8°C.
• For longer storage, serum can be frozen at -20°C for up to 3
months.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples should be avoided as they
may interfere with the analysis.
6. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) system with
UV detector or Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-
MS)
• Calibration standards for Duloxetine
• Quality control materials
• Serums (collected and prepared as per specimen requirements)
• HPLC/LC-MS consumables (vials, solvents, columns)
• Appropriate PPE (lab coat, gloves, eye protection)
7. PROCEDURE
A) Instrument Calibration and Quality Control:
1. Calibrate the HPLC/LC-MS instrument using Duloxetine
calibration standards over a range expected to cover
therapeutic levels.
2. Run quality control samples at the beginning and end of each
batch of patient samples to ensure accuracy and precision.
Document the QC results.
B) Sample Preparation:
1. Allow frozen serum samples to thaw completely at room
temperature.
2. Vortex each serum sample gently to ensure homogeneity.
3. Pipette an aliquot of serum into a clean, labeled vial suitable for
HPLC/LC-MS analysis.
C) Analysis:
1. Load the prepared samples, calibration standards, and quality
control materials onto the HPLC/LC-MS system.
2. Set the method parameters according to the instrument’s
validated method for Duloxetine.
◦ Example parameters for HPLC-UV: Column type, mobile
phase composition, flow rate, UV detection wavelength.
◦ Example parameters for LC-MS: Analytical column, mobile
phase composition, mass spectrometer settings.
3. Initiate the run sequence, ensuring proper documentation of
each sample analyzed.
D) Data Analysis and Interpretation:
1. After the run is complete, review the chromatograms and mass
spectra for each sample.
2. Integrate the peaks corresponding to Duloxetine and compare
them against calibration standards to quantify the serum levels.
3. Validate the results by confirming the QC samples are within
established control limits.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Report the Duloxetine concentration in serum in ng/mL.
2. Ensure all results are reviewed and verified by a qualified
technologist before releasing them into the Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
9. QUALITY CONTROL AND TROUBLESHOOTING
A) Quality Control:
• Perform QC checks at the beginning and end of each analytical
run.
• Ensure all QC results fall within the acceptable range before
proceeding with patient sample analysis.
B) Troubleshooting:
• If QC results are out of range, re-calibrate the instrument and re-
run the QC samples.
• If issues persist, consult the instrument's troubleshooting guide or
contact technical support.
• Document all troubleshooting actions taken during the process.
