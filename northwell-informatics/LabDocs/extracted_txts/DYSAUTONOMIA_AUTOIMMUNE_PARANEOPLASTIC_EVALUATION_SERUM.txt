DYSAUTONOMIA, AUTOIMMUNE/PARANEOPLASTIC
EVALUATION, SERUM ANALYTICAL PHASE SOP
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standard protocol for the analytical phase of generating
results of Dysautonomia, Autoimmune/Paraneoplastic Evaluation
from serum samples. It aims to ensure accuracy, reproducibility, and
quality assurance in testing procedures.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing,
documenting, and ensuring the accuracy of all tests according to
this procedure.
• Supervisors must ensure that all laboratory personnel are trained
on this SOP and that tests are performed following this procedure.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/acceptable:
• Collect whole blood in a serum separator tube (SST) or a plain
red-top tube.
• Allow the blood to clot and centrifuge within 1 hour of collection to
separate the serum.
• Transfer the serum to a clean, labeled aliquot tube and store at
2-8°C if the assay will be performed within 48 hours; if longer
storage is needed, freeze the sample at -20°C or below.
Unacceptable:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
• Serum remaining at room temperature for over 2 hours.
• Improperly labeled specimens or specimens with incomplete
documentation.
1. PROCEDURE
A) EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS:
• ELISA or immunoblot instruments (follow manufacturer's
instructions for use and maintenance).
• Microcentrifuge, microplate reader (ELISA), thermal cycler.
• Reagents: Autoimmune/Paraneoplastic ELISA kits, necessary
buffers, controls, and calibrators.
• Calibrated pipettes and tips, microtiter plates, reagents storage at
recommended temperatures.
B) CALIBRATION AND SET-UP:
• Power on the equipment and allow all systems to stabilize to the
required operational temperatures.
• Run the instrument calibration using provided or in-house
standards before any patient samples.
• Validate the proper range and functionality from the calibration
curves.
C) ASSAY PROCEDURE:
1. Preparation of Controls and Standards:
◦ Prepare high, medium, and low positive controls, a negative
control, and appropriate standards, ensuring traceability.
◦ Allow all reagents and samples to reach room temperature.
2. Sample and Reagent Loading:
◦ Place control and patient serum samples in assigned wells,
maintaining a documented sequence.
◦ Add the appropriate volume of reagents to each well as per
kit instructions, including any conjugates.
3. Incubation:
◦ Incubate the microplate according to the time and
temperature specified in the assay manual.
◦ Follow necessary washing steps thoroughly to prevent
carry-over.
4. Detection:
◦ Add substrate solution to each well. Incubate until color
development is noted (time as per kit instructions).
◦ Stop reaction with the appropriate stop solution and read the
plates using a microplate reader at the required wavelength.
5. Analysis:
◦ Calculate the results from the standard curve using logistic
regression or linear graphing software.
◦ Adjust optical density readings to generate quantitative
results.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
• Verify all control and standard values fall within expected ranges.
• Review patient results and perform any necessary outlier
elimination following QC guidelines.
• Document and report results to the laboratory information system
(LIS) for review.
• Include comments on sample integrity, analytical caveats, or
observed interferences.
Critical Values:
• Document and immediately communicate critical results to the
attending physician or supervisor, following the standard reporting
guidelines for critical values.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
A) INTERNAL QUALITY CONTROL:
• Perform quality checks with each run using predefined positive
and negative controls.
• If QC fails, investigate for potential causes and rerun both the
controls and patient samples.
B) EXTERNAL QUALITY ASSESSMENT:
• Participate in external proficiency testing programs to benchmark
assay accuracy and personnel competency.
Handling Out of Range or Invalid Results:
• If patient results fall outside expected limits or controls fail, repeat
the assay using fresh reagents or re-assessment of calibration
curves.
• Document any deviations thoroughly following laboratory QA
protocols.
1. MAINTENANCE AND TROUBLESHOOTING
• Perform routine maintenance of all instruments according to
manufacturer guidelines.
• Ensure all maintenance activities are logged and any deviations
or instrument errors are reported to the supervisor immediately.
• Cross-reference troubleshooting guides provided by the
instrument/reagent manufacturers for common error codes and
issues.
