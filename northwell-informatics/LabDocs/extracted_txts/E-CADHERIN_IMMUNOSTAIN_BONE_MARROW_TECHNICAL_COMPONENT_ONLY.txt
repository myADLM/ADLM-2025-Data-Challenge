Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Title: E-CADHERIN
Immunostain, Bone Marrow, Technical Component Only
1. PURPOSE To provide a standardized procedure for performing
E-CADHERIN immunostaining on bone marrow samples,
ensuring consistency, accuracy, and reproducibility of results.
Responsibility: Designated trained personnel are responsible for
performing the immunostaining procedure according to this SOP. It is
the responsibility of all staff to identify any deficiencies in the staining
process which may affect laboratory results and bring them to the
attention of a supervisor. Supervisors are responsible for ensuring
the procedure is adhered to and for implementing any corrective
actions required.
1. DEFINITIONS E-CADHERIN: A protein essential for cell-cell
adhesion critical in maintaining tissue structure.
Immunostaining: A laboratory technique used to detect a
specific protein within tissue specimens via antibody binding.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY Specimen
Type: Bone marrow aspirates or biopsy. Collection: Specimens
must be properly labeled with patient information and time/date
of collection. Storage: Specimens should be fixed in 10%
neutral-buffered formalin immediately after collection, then
transferred to 70% ethanol after 24 hours. Embedded in paraffin
within 1 week. Store paraffin-embedded blocks at room
temperature.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens not fixed in formalin.
• Specimens with incomplete or improper labeling.
• Specimens subject to prolonged delay between collection and
fixation leading to degradation.
1. REAGENTS, EQUIPMENT, AND SUPPLIES Primary Antibody:
Anti-E-CADHERIN antibody Secondary Antibody: Horse Radish
Peroxide (HRP)-labeled secondary antibody Detection System:
DAB substrate kit Positive Control: Known E-CADHERIN
expressing tissue Negative Control: Primary antibody omitted
Block Paraffin Sections: Bone marrow tissue fixed and
embedded in paraffin
Equipment:
• Microtome
• Slide warmer
• Staining racks
• Humidity chamber
Supplies:
• Microscope slides
• Coverslips
• Mounting medium
• Immunostaining buffer solutions
• Pipettes, tips, beakers
1. PROCEDURE Preparation of Sections:
2. Cut 4-5 µm sections from paraffin-embedded bone marrow
blocks using a microtome.
3. Place sections on coated microscope slides and air dry
overnight.
4. Heat slides on a slide warmer set at 60°C for 30 minutes.
Deparaffinization and Rehydration: 4. Deparaffinize slides in three
changes of xylene for 5 minutes each. 5. Rehydrate through graded
alcohols (100%, 95%, 80%, 70%) for 3 minutes each. 6. Rinse in
distilled water.
Antigen Retrieval: 7. Perform antigen retrieval using citrate buffer (pH
6.0) or EDTA buffer (pH 8.0) heated in a microwave or steamer for 20
minutes. 8. Allow slides to cool for 20 minutes at room temperature
and rinse in PBS.
Immunostaining: 9. Block endogenous peroxidase with 3% hydrogen
peroxide for 10 minutes and rinse in PBS. 10. Incubate slides with
blocking solution (e.g., 5% BSA or normal serum) for 20 minutes. 11.
Apply primary anti-E-CADHERIN antibody diluted per manufacturer’s
instructions and incubate slides in a humidified chamber at room
temperature for 1 hour. 12. Rinse slides in PBS three times for 5
minutes each. 13. Apply HRP-labeled secondary antibody and
incubate for 30 minutes at room temperature. 14. Rinse slides in PBS
three times for 5 minutes each. 15. Develop color using DAB
substrate per manufacturer's instructions until desired stain intensity
is achieved (typically 5-10 minutes). 16. Counterstain with
hematoxylin for 1 minute and rinse with distilled water. 17. Dehydrate
through graded alcohols and clear in xylene. 18. Mount slides with
coverslips using appropriate mounting medium.
Quality Control: Include positive and negative controls with each
batch of slides processed to ensure staining specificity and accuracy.
1. REPORTING RESULTS The technical component involves
preparation of slides stained with E-CADHERIN only.
Assessment and interpretation are performed by pathologists.
Ensure all control slides show expected results—positive
control shows specific staining and negative control shows no
staining. Discrepant findings must be flagged and notified to the
supervisor.
2. REFERENCES Refer to manufacturer’s guidelines for
antibodies and reagents used in immunostaining procedures.
3. CORRECTIVE ACTIONS If the staining procedure fails, confirm
all reagents and equipment are functioning correctly. Repeat
staining from the antigen retrieval step. Document and report
unresolved issues to the supervisor immediately.
This SOP must be reviewed annually to ensure informational
accuracy and procedural efficacy.
