Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for E-Cadherin
Immunostain, Technical Component Only
1. PURPOSE
This procedure outlines the steps required for performing the
technical component of E-Cadherin immunostain in the laboratory. E-
Cadherin immunostaining is used for the identification and targeting
of the E-Cadherin protein in tissue sections. This SOP is intended to
ensure consistency, accuracy, and reliability of the test results.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the
staining, following the outlined procedures, and ensuring that
proper controls are included.
• Supervisors are required to ensure that all personnel adhere to
this protocol and that any deviations are documented and
resolved.
2. DEFINITION
E-Cadherin is an important transmembrane protein involved in cell
adhesion. The immunostaining for E-Cadherin is an essential
diagnostic tool in identifying various carcinomas and assessing their
pathogenesis.
3. PROCEDURE
A. Reagents and Supplies:
• Xylene
• Ethanol (100%, 95%, and 70%)
• Distilled water
• H2O2 (3%)
• Antigen retrieval solution (Citrate buffer, pH 6.0)
• Blocking solution (5% Normal Serum)
• Primary antibody (E-Cadherin antibody)
• Secondary antibody (Biotinylated anti-mouse/rabbit IgG)
• ABC (Avidin-Biotin Complex) reagent
• DAB (3,3'-Diaminobenzidine) substrate solution
• Hematoxylin
• Mounting medium and coverslips
• Positive control tissue section
• Negative control (omission of primary antibody)
• Humidity chamber
B. Specimens:
Acceptable:
• Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections mounted on
positively charged slides.
Unacceptable:
• Unfixed or improperly stored samples.
• Incomplete or improperly processed paraffin blocks.
• Samples with insufficient tissue for staining.
C. Slide Preparation:
1. Prepare tissue sections at 4 µm thickness and dry in an oven at
60°C for at least 1 hour.
2. Deparaffinize the sections with three changes of xylene, 5
minutes each.
3. Rehydrate through graded alcohols (100%, 95%, 70%) and
rinse in distilled water.
D. Antigen Retrieval:
1. Place slides in a suitable container containing citrate buffer and
perform antigen retrieval by microwave heating for 10 minutes.
2. Allow the slides to cool at room temperature for 20 minutes.
3. Rinse in distilled water and then PBS (Phosphate Buffered
Saline) for 5 minutes, 3 times.
E. Immunostaining Procedure:
1. Quench endogenous peroxidase activity by incubating sections
in 3% H2O2 for 10 minutes.
2. Wash slides in PBS, 3 changes, 5 minutes each.
3. Block non-specific binding by incubating sections in blocking
solution for 20 minutes.
4. Incubate sections with the primary E-Cadherin antibody diluted
in antibody diluent overnight at 4°C in a humidity chamber.
5. Wash in PBS, 3 changes, 5 minutes each.
6. Apply the secondary antibody (biotinylated) and incubate for 30
minutes at room temperature.
7. Wash in PBS, 3 changes, 5 minutes each.
8. Incubate sections in ABC reagent for 30 minutes.
9. Wash in PBS, 3 changes, 5 minutes each.
10. Develop the color by incubating slides in DAB substrate
solution for 3–5 minutes, observing under a microscope for
appropriate staining.
11. Counterstain with hematoxylin for 1 minute, rinse in distilled
water, and blue in PBS for 5 minutes.
12. Dehydrate through graded alcohols and clear in xylene.
F. Mounting:
1. Apply mounting medium to slides and place coverslips.
2. Allow slides to dry completely.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
Include both a positive control (tissue known to express E-Cadherin)
and a negative control (omission of primary antibody) with each
staining run. Document and review control results to ensure staining
has occurred correctly.
5. REPORTING RESULTS
Since this protocol covers only the technical component, ensure the
stained slides are delivered to the pathologist for interpretation and
reporting. Record the procedural details, including reagent lot
numbers, incubation times, and any deviations from the standard
protocol in a laboratory logbook.
6. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Proper preservation and handling of tissue samples are crucial for
accurate staining.
• Ensure appropriate antigen retrieval methods to unmask epitopes.
• False-negative or false-positive results may result from subpar
quality reagents or improper procedure execution.
