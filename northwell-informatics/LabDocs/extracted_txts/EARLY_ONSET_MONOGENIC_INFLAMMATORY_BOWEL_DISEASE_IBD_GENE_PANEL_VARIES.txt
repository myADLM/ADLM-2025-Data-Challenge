1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to provide a standardized protocol for the
analytical phase of generating results for the Early Onset Monogenic
Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) Gene Panel, Varies. This protocol
ensures consistency and accuracy in the testing process and results
reporting.
Responsibility: The designated laboratory personnel are responsible
for performing all analysis procedures as outlined in this SOP. The
supervising geneticist or senior technologist is responsible for
verifying the accuracy and completeness of the results and for
troubleshooting any technical issues that may arise.
1. DEFINITION Early Onset Monogenic Inflammatory Bowel
Disease (IBD) Gene Panel is a comprehensive genetic test
designed to identify pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in
genes associated with early onset forms of IBD. The test
targets specific genes known to be linked with monogenic forms
of IBD, providing valuable insights for diagnosis and treatment.
2. PROCEDURE
Specimen Requirements: - Accepted specimens: Whole blood or
extracted DNA. - Whole blood: Collected in EDTA tubes, stored and
transported at room temperature. - Extracted DNA: Minimum
concentration of 50 ng/μL, stored and transported in TE buffer at
-20°C.
Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies: - Next-Generation Sequencing
(NGS) platform - DNA extraction kits (if required) - PCR reagents and
consumables - Targeted gene panel library preparation kits - Quality
control (QC) materials - Bioinformatics analysis software - Laboratory
Information System (LIS) for result reporting
Procedure:
A) DNA Extraction (if applicable): - Use a validated DNA extraction kit
to isolate DNA from the whole blood. - Measure DNA concentration
and purity using a spectrophotometer (e.g., NanoDrop). - Record the
DNA concentration and purity in the laboratory log. Ensure DNA
quality meets the criteria (e.g., A260/280 ratio between 1.8-2.0).
B) Library Preparation: - Use the targeted gene panel library
preparation kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions. - Perform
PCR amplification of target regions. - Purify PCR products using a
suitable purification method (e.g., bead-based purification). - Quantify
and normalize the library concentrations using a fluorometer (e.g.,
Qubit) and ensure they meet the required concentrations for
sequencing.
C) Sequencing: - Load the prepared libraries onto the NGS platform
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. - Ensure appropriate run
setup including sample sheet creation and loading of sequencing
reagents. - Monitor the sequencing run to ensure proper performance
and address any issues that arise during the run.
D) Data Analysis: - After sequencing is completed, transfer the raw
data to the bioinformatics analysis software. - Perform sequence
alignment to a reference genome, variant calling, and annotation. -
Review the variant calls and annotations ensuring that the pipeline
meets quality control criteria (e.g., minimum coverage depth, read
quality).
E) Interpretation and Reporting: - The supervising geneticist or senior
technologist reviews the annotated variant file. - Interpret pathogenic
or likely pathogenic variants in the context of the patient’s clinical
presentation. - Generate a clinical report detailing the findings,
including variant classifications, explanations, and recommendations.
- Enter the results into the LIS for verification and release.
Quality Control: - Include positive and negative controls in each
library preparation and sequencing run. - Perform intralab quality
control procedures bi-weekly by analyzing duplicate samples. - Track
and document quality control results, addressing any deviations from
expected performance immediately.
Note: All quality control measures and corrective actions must be
logged and reviewed regularly.
