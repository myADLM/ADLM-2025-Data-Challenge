Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase Protocol for Eastern Equine Encephalitis
Antibody, IgG and IgM, Serum
1. PURPOSE
This protocol outlines the steps and procedures for analyzing serum
samples to determine the presence of Eastern Equine Encephalitis
(EEE) antibodies, IgG and IgM.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred specimen: 5-10 mL of serum.
• Collection Tubes: Red-top or serum separator tubes (SST).
• Unacceptable specimens: Hemolyzed, lipemic, or contaminated
samples, as well as specimens collected in non-serum tubes
(e.g., EDTA, Citrate).
• Specimen Transportation: Serum specimens should be
transported and stored at 2-8°C. Specimens must be processed
within 24 hours of collection.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Equipment: Centrifuge, ELISA plate reader, incubator.
• Reagents: Commercial EEE IgG and IgM ELISA kits.
• Supplies: Micropipettes, pipette tips, wash buffer, incubation
plates, plasma, serum recovery trays, and appropriate ELISA
reagents.
4. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation
1. Ensure serum samples are free from clots by inspecting
visually.
2. Centrifuge the red-top tubes or SST tubes at 2500 RPM for 10
minutes to separate serum from blood cells.
3. Transfer the serum to labelled microcentrifuge tubes, avoiding
any transfer of cellular material.
B. ELISA Testing
1. Allow serum samples and ELISA kit reagents to reach room
temperature prior to beginning the assay.
2. Prepare the appropriate dilution for each sample and control as
per the ELISA kit instructions.
3. Add 100 μL of diluted serum to each well in the ELISA plate
designated for IgG testing. Repeat for IgM testing in a separate
ELISA plate.
4. Incubate the plates as specified in the ELISA kit protocol,
ensuring a proper seal to avoid evaporation.
5. Wash the plates as prescribed, usually 3-5 times with the
provided wash buffer.
6. Add the provided enzyme-conjugated secondary antibodies
specific for human IgG and IgM. Incubate according to kit
instructions.
7. Wash the plates again, as indicated.
8. Apply the substrate solution to develop the colorimetric
reaction. Monitor the reaction time closely as specified in the kit
instructions.
9. Stop the reaction using the appropriate stop solution when the
desired color intensity is achieved.
C. Reading and Interpretation
1. Use an ELISA plate reader to measure the optical density (OD)
at the appropriate wavelength(s), typically indicated in the kit
instructions.
2. Compare the OD readings from each well to the standard curve
generated by the controls.
3. Determine the IgG and IgM levels in the patient samples
according to the standard curve.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run positive and negative controls alongside patient samples in
each assay to validate test performance.
• Record control readings in the appropriate logbook and interpret
them to affirm assay reliability.
• If controls are out of range, investigate possible errors and repeat
the test.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
• Enter findings into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Review and verify results prior to releasing them.
• Report EEE IgG and IgM antibody levels in accordance with site-
specific reporting guidelines and reference ranges.
7. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• IgG: Negative to Positive
• IgM: Negative to Positive
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Cross-reactivity with antibodies from other flaviviruses or
arboviruses may occur, potentially influencing results.
• Follow manufacturer’s instructions for each ELISA kit used to
understand specific limitations.

serology.
This SOP is designed to ensure standardized processing of serum
samples for EEE antibody testing, ensuring reliable and consistent
results.
