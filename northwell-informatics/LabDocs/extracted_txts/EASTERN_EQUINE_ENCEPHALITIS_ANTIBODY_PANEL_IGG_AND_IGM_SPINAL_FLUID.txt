STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP) FOR THE
ANALYSIS OF EASTERN EQUINE ENCEPHALITIS ANTIBODY
PANEL, IGG AND IGM, SPINAL FLUID
1. PURPOSE To outline the standardized procedure for the
detection and quantification of IgG and IgM antibodies against
Eastern Equine Encephalitis (EEE) virus in spinal fluid
specimens.
Responsibility: Licensed medical laboratory scientists (MLS) or
qualified personnel will perform the tests according to this SOP. It is
the responsibility of the laboratory personnel to ensure that all quality
control procedures are followed and that the results are accurate,
precise, and reproducible.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
◦ Specimen Type: Spinal fluid
◦ Volume: Minimum volume required is 1 mL
◦ Storage: Specimens should be refrigerated at 2-8°C if not
tested immediately. Store at -20°C or lower if the delay in
testing exceeds 72 hours.
◦ Unacceptable Conditions: Specimens showing signs of
contamination, hemolysis, or an insufficient volume will be
rejected.
2. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
◦ ELISA (Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay) or specific
immunofluorescence assay kits for EEE IgG and IgM
antibodies.
◦ Calibrated micropipettes and tips
◦ Microplate reader set to the appropriate wavelength as
specified by the kit's manufacturer
◦ Incubator set at 37°C
◦ Vortex mixer
◦ Centrifuge capable of achieving at least 10,000 x g
◦ Standard laboratory glassware and disposables
3. REAGENTS
◦ ELISA or immunofluorescence assay kits including all
reagents outlined in the kit insert (coated plates, wash
buffers, conjugates, substrates, and controls)
◦ Distilled water or deionized water for preparing reagents
◦ Additional reagents as specified by the assay protocol
4. PROCEDURE A. Preparation:
◦ Bring all reagents and specimens to room temperature
(18-25°C) before starting the assay.
◦ Prepare wash buffer and other working reagents according
to the manufacturer's instructions.
B. Assay Procedure:
1. Label the required number of wells on the coated
microplate for controls, calibrators, and samples.
2. Add the specified volume of patient specimens,
calibrators, and controls to appropriate wells.
3. Incubate the plate at 37°C for the recommended duration.
4. Wash the wells thoroughly with the wash buffer to remove
unbound materials.
5. Add the conjugate to each well and incubate as per the
manufacturer's instructions.
6. Wash the wells again thoroughly to ensure complete
removal of unbound conjugate.
7. Add the substrate solution to each well and incubate in
the dark for the recommended time.
8. Stop the reaction by adding the stop solution as per the
assay protocol.
9. Read the optical density (OD) of each well within the
specified timeframe using a microplate reader set to the
appropriate wavelength.
C. Quality Control:
◦ Include both negative and positive controls in each run to
validate assay performance.
◦ Results must not be released if controls do not perform as
expected.
5. CALCULATION AND INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
◦ Calculate the mean OD values for each control, standard,
and test sample.
◦ Generate a standard curve using the calibrator OD values
and determine the antibody concentrations in patient
specimens by comparing their OD values to the standard
curve.
◦ Qualitative results can be interpreted based on the cutoff
values provided by the kit manufacturer.
6. REPORTING OF RESULTS
◦ Report results for IgG and IgM antibodies separately.
◦ Follow site-specific guidelines for result entry into the
Laboratory Information System (LIS).
◦ Critical values or unusual results should be reviewed and
verified by a supervisory MLS before being released.
7. REFERENCE INTERVALS AND CRITICAL VALUES
◦ Negative: IgG and IgM antibody levels below the cutoff
value.
◦ Positive: IgG and/or IgM antibody levels above the cutoff
value indicating possible EEE virus infection or past
exposure.
◦ Borderline: Results within the indeterminate range should be
re-evaluated or additional testing should be conducted per
the clinical setting.
8. LIMITATIONS
◦ Hemolysis, turbidity, presence of lipids, or bacterial
contamination in the specimen may interfere with test
results.
◦ Cross-reactivity with other arboviruses may occur; additional
confirmatory testing may be required in equivocal cases.
◦ Proper specimen handling and adherence to the assay
protocol are critical for obtaining valid results.

Immunoassays.
10. REVISION HISTORY
◦ Documented changes and updates to the SOP, including
validation of new test kits, equipment calibration records,
and updates to the reference interval protocol.
This protocol is intended for use by qualified laboratory personnel
and must be adhered to ensure consistent and accurate analytical
results for the detection of Eastern Equine Encephalitis antibodies in
spinal fluid specimens.
