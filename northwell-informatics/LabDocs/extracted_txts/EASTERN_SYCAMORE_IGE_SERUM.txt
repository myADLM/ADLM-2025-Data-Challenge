Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Protocol for the Analytical Phase of Generating Results for
EASTERN SYCAMORE, IGE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
This SOP provides detailed instructions for the analytical procedure
to generate results for Eastern Sycamore, IgE, Serum to ensure
accuracy and consistency in testing and reporting.
Responsibility:
• It is the responsibility of trained laboratory technologists to
perform the analytical phase following this SOP.
• The supervisor is responsible for verifying that the procedures are
followed and documented correctly.
1. PRINCIPLE
The analysis involves quantifying specific IgE antibodies to Eastern
Sycamore pollen allergens in a patient’s serum using ImmunoCAP
technology (or an equivalent method). The procedure assesses
allergic sensitivity to Eastern Sycamore by measuring IgE
concentrations.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type:
• Serum collected using standard venipuncture technique.
Minimum Volume:
• 500 µL of serum.
Collection and Handling:
• Collect blood in a plain red-top or serum separator tube (SST).
• Allow blood to clot completely at room temperature.
• Centrifuge and separate serum from the cells within 2 hours of
collection.
• Store serum frozen at -20°C if not analyzed within 24 hours.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
• Specimens collected in anticoagulant tubes (e.g., EDTA, heparin).
1. REAGENTS AND EQUIPMENT
Reagents:
• Eastern Sycamore specific IgE reagent kits.
• Control reagents (low, medium, high).
• Calibrators.
Equipment:
• ImmunoCAP (or equivalent) equipment.
• Centrifuge.
• Pipettes and tips.
• Vortex mixer.
• Laboratory-grade ice packs and dry ice (if needed for storage).
1. PROCEDURE
Pre-Analytical Checks:
1. Reagent Preparation:
◦ Ensure that all reagents and control solutions are prepared
and brought to room temperature following the kit
manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Calibration:
◦ Perform calibration using the provided calibrators as per the
instrument's operating manual.
Analytical Steps:
1. Sample Loading:
◦ Vortex the specimen tube for 5 seconds to ensure
homogeneity.
◦ Load 100 µL of the patient serum into the designated test
well or reaction cuvette.
2. Analyzing:
◦ Follow the equipment's operational protocol to perform the
assay, ensuring that parameters specific to Eastern
Sycamore IgE quantification are selected.
◦ Start the assay and monitor the progress.
3. Quality Control:
◦ Run control samples (low, medium, high) at the start of each
day’s test run to ensure the accuracy and precision of the
assay. Compare results against acceptable control ranges.
Post-Analytical Steps:
1. Result Review:
◦ After the assay is complete, review the results output by the
instrument for any flags or error codes.
◦ Ensure result integrity by comparing test results against the
control ranges.
2. Data Documentation:
◦ Document results in the laboratory information system (LIS).
◦ Any results outside the control range or system errors
should prompt a repeated run of the control and affected
patient samples.
3. REPORTING RESULTS
• Record and verify results in LIS.
• Report serum-specific IgE levels for Eastern Sycamore in kU/L
with the following reference intervals:
◦ < 0.35 kU/L: Negative
◦ 0.35-0.69 kU/L: Borderline Positive
◦ 0.70-3.49 kU/L: Positive
◦ ≥ 3.50 kU/L: Strongly Positive
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Document all control runs and maintain logs as per regulatory
requirements.
• If controls fall outside of the acceptable range, do not report
patient results until resolved.
• Periodic review and comparison using inter-laboratory or
proficiency testing for IgE.
1. MAINTENANCE AND CALIBRATION
• Follow instrument-specific protocol for daily/weekly/monthly
maintenance.
• Calibrate the instrument as required per manufacturer’s
instructions or at least once a month.
