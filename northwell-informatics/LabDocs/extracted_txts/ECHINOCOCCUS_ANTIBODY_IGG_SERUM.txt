Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Echinococcus Antibody,
IgG, Serum Testing
1. PURPOSE To outline the procedure for the analysis and
reporting of Echinococcus Antibody, IgG, in serum samples to
ensure consistent, accurate, and reliable results.
2. SCOPE This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel
responsible for performing the Echinococcus Antibody, IgG,
Serum test.
3. RESPONSIBILITY It is the responsibility of designated
laboratory personnel to perform the analysis, monitor and
document quality control, and report the results. Supervisors
are responsible for overseeing operations and addressing any
issues or deviations from protocol.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred Specimen: Serum. Minimum volume required is 1.0 mL.
• Collection: Serum specimens should be collected in a serum
separator tube (SST).
• Stability: Specimens are stable for up to 7 days if refrigerated
(2-8°C) or 6 months if frozen (-20°C or below).
• Unacceptable Specimens: Grossly hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric
specimens.
1. REAGENTS AND CONSUMABLES
• Echinococcus Antibody, IgG, ELISA Kit
• Wash buffer
• Substrate solution
• Stop solution
• Microplate reader
• Disposable pipette tips
• Micropipettes
1. EQUIPMENT
• Microplate reader capable of reading at 450 nm
• Incubator set at 37°C
• Microplate washer (optional)
• Vortex mixer
• Centrifuge
1. PROCEDURE A) Preparation
• Allow all reagents and samples to reach room temperature
(18-25°C) before use.
• Thoroughly mix all reagents by gently inverting or swirling; do not
vortex.
• Label all samples, standards, controls, and assay wells clearly.
B) Assay Procedure
1. Prepare the required number of wells in the microplate.
2. Add 100 µL of standards, patient samples, and control sera to
the appropriate wells in duplicate.
3. Incubate the plate at 37°C for 30 minutes.
4. Wash the wells three times with wash buffer (300 µL per well
per wash).
5. Add 100 µL of enzyme conjugate to each well.
6. Incubate the plate at 37°C for 30 minutes.
7. Wash the wells five times with wash buffer.
8. Add 100 µL of substrate solution to each well.
9. Incubate the plate in the dark at room temperature for 15
minutes.
10. Add 50 µL of stop solution to each well to terminate the
reaction.
11. Read the optical density at 450 nm using a microplate reader
within 30 minutes of adding the stop solution.
C) Calculations
• Calculate the mean absorbance for each standard, control, and
sample.
• Construct a standard curve by plotting the mean absorbance of
each standard against its corresponding concentration.
• Determine the concentration of Echinococcus Antibody, IgG, in
each patient sample by interpolation from the standard curve.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include positive and negative controls in each assay run.
• Controls should fall within the acceptable range specified in the kit
insert.
• If control values are outside the specified limits, the run is invalid
and must be repeated.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Report results in IU/mL as determined from the standard curve.
• Reference Interval: Negative: <1.0 IU/mL, Equivocal: 1.0-1.5 IU/
mL, Positive: >1.5 IU/mL.
• Interpret results based on reference intervals and patient clinical
information.
• Document and verify results according to laboratory policy before
releasing them into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
1. REFERENCES
• Kit insert for the Echinococcus Antibody, IgG, ELISA Kit.
• Laboratory manual and policies on quality control and result
reporting.
1. MAINTENANCE
• Regular maintenance should be performed on all equipment as
per the manufacturer's recommendations.
• Log the maintenance activities in the appropriate logbook.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING
• Consult the kit insert and manufacturer's guidelines for any
troubleshooting information.
• Any unresolved issues should be reported to the supervisor for
further action.
