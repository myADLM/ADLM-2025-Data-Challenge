Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Echinococcus
Antibody (IgG) Testing in Serum
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the protocol for performing
Echinococcus antibody (IgG) testing in serum to ensure accurate and
reliable detection of Echinococcus infections.
1. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel trained to perform
the Echinococcus antibody (IgG) testing for serum samples within the
CLIA-certified laboratory.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for conducting the
test, ensuring adherence to the protocol, performing quality control
procedures, and reporting the results according to the guidelines
provided in this SOP.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/Acceptable:
• 5-10 mL of serum collected in a clot activator (red-top) or serum
separator (SST) tube.
• Specimens must be centrifuged promptly, and serum separated
within 2 hours of collection.
• Serum can be stored at 2-8°C for up to 48 hours. For extended
storage, serum should be frozen at -20°C or colder.
Unacceptable:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic or icteric samples.
• Specimens stored at room temperature for more than 8 hours.
• Specimens received in tubes other than approved clot activator or
SST tubes.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• EIA/ELISA reader capable of reading absorbance at 450 nm and
620 nm as a reference.
• Microplate washer or manual washing system.
• Calibrated pipettes (single and multichannel).
• Disposable pipette tips (aerosol barrier recommended).
• Echinococcus antibody (IgG) EIA/ELISA kits (store as per
manufacturer instructions).
• Non-sterile polypropylene tubes for sample dilutions.
• Laboratory timer.
• Personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves, lab coat,
and safety glasses.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preliminary Steps:
1. Allow all reagents and serum samples to reach room
temperature (20-25°C) before beginning the assay.
2. Prepare the microplate by setting up wells according to the
manufacturer’s instructions for controls, standards, and patient
samples.
3. Label all necessary tubes and wells clearly.
B. Sample and Reagent Preparation:
1. Dilute patient serum samples as recommended by the kit insert
(commonly 1:100) in the provided sample diluent.
2. Prepare standards and controls following the manufacturer's
instructions.
C. Assay Procedure:
1. Add diluted patient samples, controls, and standards to the
corresponding wells of the microplate.
2. Incubate the plate according to the kit's specified time and
temperature.
3. Wash the microplate using the microplate washer or manually,
ensuring that all wells are washed appropriately.
4. Add enzyme conjugate or other reagents as specified by the kit
instructions.
5. Incubate the microplate again as per kit instructions.
6. Repeat the washing step to remove unbound conjugate.
7. Add the substrate solution to all wells and incubate for the
recommended time without direct light exposure.
8. Stop the reaction by adding stop solution to each well.
D. Reading and Interpreting Results:
1. Read the absorbance values of the microplate at 450 nm using
an ELISA reader, with 620 nm as the reference wavelength.
2. Calculate the mean absorbance for each set of duplicates for
standards, controls, and patient samples.
3. Construct a standard curve by plotting the mean absorbance of
standards against their corresponding concentrations.
4. Determine the concentration of Echinococcus antibody in
patient samples by interpolating from the standard curve.
5. Verify that control results are within acceptable ranges before
accepting patient results.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run positive and negative controls with each batch of tests to
ensure assay performance.
• Perform quality control checks according to the kit insert
specifications and document the results.
• If controls are out of range, investigate and resolve the issue
before reporting patient results.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Enter the concentration of Echinococcus antibody (IgG) into the
Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Results should be reviewed and validated by a trained
technologist.
• Report results as "Detected" or "Not Detected" based on the
cutoff values provided by the test manufacturer, indicating the
presence or absence of Echinococcus antibodies.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's instructions for the Echinococcus antibody (IgG)
ELISA/EIA kit.
• CLSI guidelines for Serological Tests.
1. DOCUMENTATION
• Maintain records of all quality control results and patient results
for review and compliance with regulatory standards.
• Document any deviations from the SOP along with corrective
actions taken.
1. REVISION HISTORY
• Document any changes to the protocol and the date of
implementation.
