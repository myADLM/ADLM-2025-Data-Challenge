1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to provide a standardized method
for the analysis of serum samples for the Eculizumab Monitoring
Panel, including the monitoring of eculizumab (Soliris) levels and
complement activation markers (e.g., CH50, C5, and C5a). Accurate
quantification is essential to ensure therapeutic efficacy and patient
safety.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen Type:
• Serum
Collection:
• Collect blood in a serum separator tube (SST or red top)
• Allow the blood to clot for 30 minutes at room temperature.
Centrifugation:
• Centrifuge at 1500g for 10 minutes within 2 hours of collection.
• Aliquot serum into clean, appropriately labeled tubes.
Storage and Stability:
• Fresh serum samples are preferred.
• If immediate analysis is not possible, store the serum aliquots at
2-8°C for up to 72 hours.
• For long-term storage (>72 hours), store serum aliquots at -20°C
or colder. Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Calibrated pipettes and tips
• Centrifuge
• Refrigerator (2-8°C) and Freezer (-20°C or colder)
• Microplate reader capable of measuring absorbance at the
appropriate wavelength for ELISA
• Eculizumab ELISA Kit
• Complement CH50 ELISA Kit
• Complement C5 and C5a ELISA Kits
4. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Ensure all reagents and serum samples are brought to room
temperature (20-25°C) before use.
2. Prepare all reagents, calibration standards, and controls
according to the manufacturer’s instructions provided with each
kit.
Eculizumab ELISA:
1. Add 100 µL of standards, controls, and serum samples to the
wells of the ELISA plate as specified by the kit protocol.
2. Incubate the plate according to the kit’s specified time.
3. Wash the wells with the provided wash buffer.
4. Add the appropriate detection antibodies and incubate.
5. Add substrate solution and incubate.
6. Stop the reaction as per the kit instructions.
7. Measure the absorbance at the wavelength specified by the
manufacturer’s kit.
CH50, C5, and C5a ELISA:
1. Follow the specific kit instructions for each marker. The general
steps include: a. Addition of standards, controls, and samples.
b. Incubation steps as specified. c. Washing steps as specified.
d. Addition of detection reagents. e. Substrate reaction. f.
Stopping the reaction. g. Measurement of absorbance.
Quality Control:
1. Run quality control samples alongside patient samples in each
assay to ensure accurate and reliable results.
2. Review quality control results before releasing patient results. If
control results are not within acceptable ranges, troubleshoot
and repeat the assay.
5. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Calculate the concentrations of eculizumab, CH50, C5, and
C5a based on the standard curves generated from the
standards.
2. Record and review the results for each patient sample.
3. Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
4. Any critical or outlier values should be reviewed and flagged
according to laboratory policy.
6. METHOD LIMITATIONS
1. Ensure proper handling and storage of samples to avoid
degradation of analytes.
2. Follow manufacturer’s instructions for ELISA kits rigorously to
ensure accuracy.
3. It is crucial to avoid hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric specimens,
as they can interfere with assay results.

8. PERSONNEL TRAINING AND SPECIFIC RESPONSIBILITIES
1. Only trained and authorized laboratory personnel should
perform the Eculizumab Monitoring Panel assay.
2. Regular training and competency assessments should be
conducted to ensure adherence to this SOP.
By following these detailed steps, the analytical phase of eculizumab
serum monitoring ensures accurate and timely results for patient
management.
