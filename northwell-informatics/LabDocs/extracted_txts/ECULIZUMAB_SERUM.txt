Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for ECULIZUMAB, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
To provide step-by-step guidelines for the analysis of ECULIZUMAB
levels in serum samples, ensuring accurate and reliable test results.
Responsibility:
Designated staff will perform the analysis by following the procedures
outlined in this document. It is the responsibility of all staff to identify
and correct any deficiencies that may affect test results.
1. DEFINITION
ECULIZUMAB (Soliris) is a monoclonal antibody used to treat
paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) and atypical hemolytic
uremic syndrome (aHUS). The accurate measurement of serum
levels is crucial for patient management.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Requirements
1. Preferred Specimen:
◦ Serum collected in a red-top tube without gel separator.
◦ Minimum volume required: 2 mL of serum.
◦ Specimens should be stored and transported at 2-8°C and
analyzed within 48 hours of collection.
2. Unacceptable Specimens:
◦ Serum samples collected in tubes with anticoagulants (e.g.,
EDTA, heparin).
◦ Specimens that are hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric.
◦ Specimens not stored or transported within the specified
temperature range.
B. Equipment and Reagents
• High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) or similar
analytical instrument.
• Calibrated micropipettes and tips.
• ECULIZUMAB calibrators and controls.
• Solvents and reagents as required by the specific analytical
method.
C. Calibration and Quality Control
1. Calibration:
◦ Perform calibration of the HPLC system using
ECULIZUMAB standards before running patient samples.
◦ Follow site-specific calibration guidelines and record
calibration details.
2. Quality Control:
◦ Run quality control samples (low, medium, and high
concentration controls) before and after patient samples.
◦ Ensure QC results are within acceptable limits before
proceeding with patient sample analysis.
◦ Document and review QC results according to site-specific
guidelines.
D. Analytical Procedure
1. Sample Preparation:
◦ Aliquot 0.5 mL of serum into appropriately labeled sample
tubes.
◦ If necessary, dilute samples according to the analytical
method's requirements.
◦ Mix samples gently and avoid foam or bubbles.
2. Sample Analysis:
◦ Load samples, calibrators, and controls onto the HPLC
system.
◦ Set up the instrument according to the manufacturer's
instructions and method parameters.
◦ Start the analysis and monitor the system for any
irregularities.
3. Data Verification:
◦ Review the chromatograms and peak integrations.
◦ Verify that all control samples meet the acceptance criteria.
◦ Identify and flag any samples with irregularities or results
outside the acceptable range for further evaluation.
E. Reporting Results
1. Interpret and record ECULIZUMAB serum levels.
2. Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
3. Review and verify results before final reporting.
4. If critical results or issues are identified, notify the supervising
technologist or pathologist immediately.
F. Method Limitations
Refer to the specific analytical method and instrument guidelines for
limitations.

1. DOCUMENTATION
Ensure all steps are documented thoroughly, including specimen
handling, calibration, quality control, sample analysis, and result
reporting. Store documentation according to site-specific guidelines
and regulatory requirements.
This protocol serves as a comprehensive guide for staff in the
analytical phase of ECULIZUMAB serum level testing. All personnel
must be familiar with and adhere to these procedures to maintain the
highest standards of accuracy and reliability in test results.
