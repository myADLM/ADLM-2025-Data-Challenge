Targeted Mutation Analysis, 51 Mutation Panel, Tumor
1. Purpose
This SOP outlines the procedures for the analytical phase of
generating EGFR gene mutation results, specifically targeting a 51
mutation panel for tumor samples. The objective is to ensure
consistent, accurate, and timely analysis and reporting of EGFR
mutations in tumor tissue samples.
2. Scope
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel authorized to perform
and supervise EGFR gene mutation analysis using the designated 51
mutation panel in a CLIA-certified laboratory.
3. Responsibilities
• Laboratory Technologists are responsible for performing the
assay, analyzing data, and recording results per this SOP.
• Supervisors/Team Leads are responsible for ensuring the
adherence to this SOP and addressing any issues that may arise
during the analysis.
4. Definitions
• EGFR: Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor.
• PCR: Polymerase Chain Reaction.
• NGS: Next-Generation Sequencing.
• QC: Quality Control.
5. Specimen Requirements
• Tumor tissue collected via biopsy or surgical resection.
• Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks are
acceptable.
• Fresh-frozen tissue may also be utilized but must be processed
immediately or stored appropriately.
6. Supplies and Equipment
• DNA extraction kits
• Reagents and consumables for PCR/NGS
• Thermal cycler
• NGS platform compatible with the 51 mutation panel
• Bioinformatics software for data analysis
• Quality control materials (positive and negative controls)
• Certified reference materials
• Documentation logs
7. Procedure
A. DNA Extraction
1. Sample Preparation
◦ Confirm the identity of the tumor sample using patient
labelling.
◦ Measure the tissue area and trim as necessary for optimal
DNA yield.
2. Extraction Process
◦ Utilize validated DNA extraction kits following the
manufacturer’s protocol.
◦ Ensure thorough homogenization and lysis of samples.
◦ Quantify extracted DNA using a spectrophotometer and
assess its purity.
3. Quality Check
◦ Determine the DNA concentration and purity (A260/280
ratio).
◦ Run a sample on agarose gel to confirm genomic DNA
integrity.
B. PCR Amplification
1. Reagent Preparation
◦ Prepare the PCR master mix according to manufacturer’s
instructions for the target sequences.
◦ Include internal controls and no-template controls.
2. Amplification
◦ Aliquot the master mix into PCR tubes or plates.
◦ Add the extracted DNA to each tube/plate well.
3. Thermal Cycling
◦ Program the thermal cycler with appropriate cycling
conditions for the target mutations.
◦ Ensure the reaction includes initial denaturation, followed by
cycles of denaturation, annealing, and extension, with a final
extension.
C. Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS)
1. Library Preparation
◦ Prepare DNA libraries from PCR amplicons according to the
NGS platform protocol.
◦ Include steps like end-repair, A-tailing, and adaptor ligation
as required.
2. Sequencing Run
◦ Load libraries onto the NGS platform.
◦ Ensure correct settings and sufficient read depth to detect
target mutations.
◦ Run the sequencer following manufacturer’s guidelines.
D. Data Analysis
1. Raw Data Processing
◦ Utilize the bioinformatics pipeline to process raw NGS data.
◦ Perform base-calling, alignment to the reference genome,
and variant calling.
2. Analysis and Interpretation
◦ Filter and annotate variants to identify mutations relevant to
the EGFR 51 mutation panel.
◦ Cross-reference identified mutations with databases and
literature for clinical relevance.
3. Quality Control
◦ Ensure that QC metrics for NGS (e.g., read depth,
alignment percentage) meet acceptable thresholds.
◦ Validate results against control specimens.
E. Reporting Results
1. Result Documentation
◦ Review and verify the sequencing data and mutation
analysis results.
◦ Document findings in the laboratory information system
(LIS).
2. Report Generation
◦ Include the identified EGFR mutations, their clinical
significance, and any relevant interpretative comments.
◦ Verify and sign off on the report by authorized personnel.
3. Issuance
◦ Deliver the final report to the requesting clinician or
pathologist.
8. Quality Control and Assurance
• Run positive, negative, and no-template controls with each batch.
• Follow manufacturer’s instructions for equipment calibration and
maintenance schedules.
• Perform biannual proficiency testing.
• Document all QC results and take corrective actions when
necessary.
9. Documentation
• Maintain accurate records of DNA extraction, PCR amplification,
sequencing runs, and data analysis.
• Archive reports for potential future reference and regulatory
compliance.
