1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized protocol for the analysis and reporting of
Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) targeted mutation
analysis with Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK) reflex testing in
tumor specimens.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory staff are responsible for
performing the EGFR targeted mutation analysis and ALK reflex
testing according to this protocol. It is the responsibility of all staff to
ensure that accurate and reliable test results are generated and
reported, adhering to the standard operating procedures (SOPs)
outlined here.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimens:
• Acceptable: Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor
tissue blocks or unstained slides containing tumor tissue sections.
• Quantity: Minimum of five unstained slides or one FFPE block.
• Specimen Handling: FFPE blocks and slides should be stored at
room temperature and protected from moisture.
Unacceptable:
• Specimens with insufficient tumor content.
• Specimens that have been poorly preserved or improperly fixed.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• PCR instrumentation (e.g., qPCR machine)
• EGFR mutation analysis kits (approved by relevant regulatory
authorities)
• ALK reflex testing kits (approved by relevant regulatory
authorities)
• Microtome for sectioning FFPE blocks
• DNA extraction kits
• Reagent grade chemicals (deionized water, ethanol, etc.)
• Quality control material (positive and negative controls)
1. PROCEDURE
A. DNA Extraction from FFPE Tissue
1. Deparaffinize FFPE tumor sections. For unstained slides, place
them in xylene.
2. Perform DNA extraction according to the manufacturer’s
instructions provided with the DNA extraction kit. Ensure
complete tissue digestion and high-quality DNA yield.
3. Measure DNA concentration and confirm suitable quality using
spectrophotometry or fluorometry.
B. EGFR Targeted Mutation Analysis
1. Amplify extracted DNA using PCR with EGFR-specific primers.
2. Perform mutation detection using a qPCR machine or next-
generation sequencing (NGS) platform, as per kit instructions.
3. Include positive and negative controls in each run to ensure
assay validity.
4. Analyze data for the presence of targeted EGFR mutations.
C. ALK Reflex Testing (if EGFR mutations are not detected)
1. If EGFR mutations are not identified, proceed to ALK reflex
testing using immunohistochemistry (IHC) or fluorescence in
situ hybridization (FISH).
2. Perform ALK staining or hybridization according to the kit
manufacturer’s protocol.
3. Evaluate ALK test results using a microscope (for IHC) or
fluorescence microscope (for FISH).
4. Document the results and interpret based on established
criteria for ALK positivity.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
A. Internal Quality Control
1. Include known positive and negative controls in each analytical
run for both EGFR and ALK testing.
2. Verify that control results fall within expected ranges.
B. Instrument Calibration and Maintenance
1. Calibrate PCR and NGS instruments regularly according to
manufacturer guidelines.
2. Perform routine maintenance checks and document any
corrective actions taken.
3. REPORTING RESULTS
A. Data Analysis and Interpretation
1. Review all data generated from EGFR mutation analysis and
ALK reflex testing.
2. Compare patient results to control results ensuring consistency
and accuracy.
B. Result Verification
1. Verify results by a qualified technologist to confirm the
correctness and completeness of the data.
2. Report results in the laboratory information system (LIS),
ensuring proper documentation for laboratory records.
C. Communication of Critical Results
1. Notify attending physicians of any critical EGFR and ALK
results as per lab policy.
2. Properly document all communications in the patient’s record.
