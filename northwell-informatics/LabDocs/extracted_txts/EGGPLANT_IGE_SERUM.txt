Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for EGGPLANT, IGE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this protocol is to outline the procedures involved in
generating accurate and reliable results for Eggplant-Specific
Immunoglobulin E (IGE) in serum samples using the designated
laboratory equipment and instruments. This protocol ensures that
analytical techniques, quality control measures, and reporting
procedures are followed to provide precise and accurate patient
results.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing
the analysis and ensuring adherence to this SOP.
• It is the responsibility of the laboratory supervisor to ensure that
all laboratory staff are trained and comply with this SOP.
1. DEFINITION
Eggplant, IGE, Serum: Refers to the specific Immunoglobulin E
antibodies against eggplant allergens found in a patient's serum.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Serum
• Collection: Collect blood specimens using standard phlebotomy
techniques. Allow the blood to clot at room temperature,
centrifuge, and separate the serum as soon as possible.
• Storage: Serum specimens should be stored at 2-8°C for up to 72
hours. For long-term storage, freeze specimens at -20°C or
colder.
• Unacceptable Specimens: Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples
may affect results and should be avoided.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Immunoassay Analyzer (e.g., ImmunoCAP, ELISA reader)
• Specific IGE reagents and calibrators for eggplant allergen
• Quality control material (low, medium, and high concentrations)
• Pipettes and tips
• Centrifuge
• Incubator (if necessary for the specific immunoassay)
• Microcentrifuge tubes
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
• Sample storage racks
1. PROCEDURE
A) Pre-Analytical Preparation:
• Check the reagent and control material expiry dates and ensure
they are within the valid period.
• Allow all reagents and control materials to reach room
temperature before use.
• Prepare the necessary equipment and instruments as per the
manufacturer's instructions.
B) Sample Analysis:
1. Calibration:
◦ Calibrate the immunoassay analyzer using the provided
calibrators specific for the Eggplant IGE assay. Follow the
manufacturer's instructions for calibration.
◦ Document the calibration results, including date, time, and
person performing the calibration.
2. Quality Control:
◦ Run quality control samples (low, medium, and high) before
processing patient samples. Verify that QC results are within
the acceptable range.
◦ Document the QC results, including date, time, and person
performing the QC.
3. Sample Processing:
◦ Label microcentrifuge tubes with unique identifiers for each
patient sample.
◦ Pipette the required volume of patient serum into the
designated wells or tubes following the assay protocol.
◦ Add the appropriate reagents and incubate as per the
manufacturer's instructions.
◦ Measure the absorbance or fluorescence using the
immunoassay analyzer.
4. Data Analysis:
◦ Analyze the raw data using the immunoassay analyzer
software.
◦ Ensure that the patient results fall within the assay's valid
measurement range. Repeat the assay if results are outside
the reportable range or if there is any indication of assay
interference.
C) Post-Analytical Process:
• Verify the patient results against QC and calibration data.
• Document any deviations or issues encountered during the
analysis and notify the supervisor for further action.
• Record the patient results in the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform quality control at the beginning of each assay run and
after any calibration or maintenance of the analyzer.
• Utilize commercially available control material to monitor assay
performance.
• Investigate and resolve any QC failures before reporting patient
results.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results must be reviewed and verified by the designated
technologist before release.
• Results should be reported with the appropriate reference ranges
and flagged where necessary.
• Critical values should be communicated to the requesting
physician as per laboratory protocol.
Reference Intervals:
• Specific reference intervals for Eggplant IGE levels must be
provided based on assay validation data.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to the manufacturer's package insert for limitations specific
to the Eggplant IGE immunoassay.
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples may yield inaccurate
results.
