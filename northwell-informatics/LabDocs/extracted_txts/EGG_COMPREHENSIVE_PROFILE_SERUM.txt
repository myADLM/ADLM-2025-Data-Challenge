EGG COMPREHENSIVE PROFILE, SERUM - Standard Operating
Procedure (SOP)
1. PURPOSE
To ensure accurate, reliable and reproducible results are generated
for the Egg Comprehensive Profile (ECP) conducted on serum
specimens in a timely manner, facilitating effective patient care.
Responsibility: Designated technologist is responsible for performing
the analytical procedures as outlined in this SOP. It is the
responsibility of the laboratory director and supervisor to monitor
adherence to the SOP and ensure corrective actions are taken when
necessary.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND HANDLING
Specimen Collection:
• Preferred/Acceptable: Serum collected into a serum separator
tube (SST).
• Volume Required: Minimum of 1 mL serum.
• Handling: After collection, allow the blood to clot by leaving it
undisturbed for 30 minutes at room temperature. Centrifuge the
SST at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes to separate serum from clot.
Transfer the serum into a labelled transfer tube if required and
store at 2-8°C until analysis is performed. If longer storage is
needed, freeze at -20°C or colder.
Unacceptable Samples:
• Specimens with gross hemolysis.
• Specimens collected in tubes other than SST (e.g., EDTA,
heparin).
• Specimens received beyond the stability timeframe (serum stable
for 48 hours refrigerated, 6 months frozen).
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• Automated Biochemistry Analyzer capable of performing
comprehensive metabolic and lipid profiles.
• Quality Control materials (Low, Medium, High).
• Calibrators specific to the analyzer and assay.
• Disposable tips, sample cups, and other consumables required by
the analyzer.
• Personal protective equipment (PPE) for technologists (gloves,
lab coat, safety glasses).
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation and Calibrations:
1. Ensure that the analyzer is properly maintained and calibrated
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Document
calibration on the equipment log.
B. Quality Control:
1. Run quality control samples (Low, Medium, High) at the
beginning of each shift. Ensure that all QC results fall within
acceptable ranges before proceeding with patient specimens.
Document QC results in the QC log.
2. If QC fails, investigate and resolve the issue according to the
laboratory’s QC failure protocol before continuing with patient
testing.
C. Sample Analysis:
1. Load patient serum samples onto the analyzer as per the
manufacturer’s guidelines.
2. Select the Egg Comprehensive Profile from the test menu.
3. Initiate the analysis following the on-screen prompts provided
by the analyzer’s software.
D. Result Verification:
1. Once analysis is complete, review the results for any flagged
values or error messages. If flags or errors are present, re-run
the analysis if sufficient sample volume remains, or prepare a
new aliquot if necessary.
2. Verify results by comparing them against established reference
ranges and review for any inconsistencies or clinically
significant findings. Ensure that all results are within the
linearity limits of the analyzer.
E. Result Entry and Reporting:
1. Enter verified results into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS). Ensure that all results are accurately documented with
patients' identifying information.
2. Notify the ordering physician of critical values without delay,
documenting the communication process per laboratory policy.
3. TROUBLESHOOTING AND CORRECTIVE ACTIONS:
• Out of Range QC: a. Repeat the QC run to confirm the result. b.
Investigate possible causes such as reagent issues, equipment
malfunction, or operator error. c. If unresolved, contact the
manufacturer’s technical support for guidance.
• Instrument Error: a. Refer to the analyzer’s troubleshooting
guide and follow recommended procedures. b. Document any
troubleshooting steps taken and results in the maintenance log. c.
If necessary, use backup instrumentation until the primary
analyzer is functional.
1. QUALITY CONTROL AND PROFICIENCY TESTING:
• Run external proficiency testing samples according to the
laboratory schedule.
• Participate in inter-laboratory comparison programs.
• Compare results for consistency and accuracy, investigating
discrepancies promptly.
1. REPORTING RESULTS:
• Reference intervals for Egg Comprehensive Profile will be
provided alongside the results. The intervals must be verified for
the specific population served by the laboratory.
• Reference Intervals:
◦ Total Cholesterol: <200 mg/dL
◦ LDL Cholesterol: <130 mg/dL
◦ HDL Cholesterol: >60 mg/dL
◦ Triglycerides: <150 mg/dL
◦ etc.
• Results should be reviewed by a qualified laboratory technologist
or pathologist before release.
1. DOCUMENTATION AND RECORD KEEPING:
• Maintain records of all calibrations, quality control runs, patient
results, and any corrective actions taken.
• Ensure that documentation complies with CLIA standards,
including date, time, operator initials, and any relevant comments.
1. REFERENCES:
• Analyzer manufacturer’s user manual and package inserts for
reagents and calibrators.
• CLIA guidelines and laboratory-specific SOPs for Quality Control
and Calibration.
By following these procedures, the laboratory ensures that the Egg
Comprehensive Profile, Serum results are accurate, reliable, and
timely, facilitating effective patient diagnosis and management.
