Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Egg White Component Profile, Serum
1. PURPOSE To outline the method for the analysis of egg white
component profiles in serum specimens, ensuring reliable and
accurate test results. This procedure includes detailed steps on
handling, preparation, and analysis of serum samples using
designated laboratory instruments and methods.
2. SCOPE This SOP applies to all CLIA-certified laboratory staff
involved in performing and processing egg white component
profile tests on serum samples.
3. RESPONSIBILITY It is the responsibility of designated
laboratory personnel to adhere to this procedure, including
preparation, analysis, documentation, and reporting of results. It
is also their responsibility to ensure compliance with quality
control and troubleshooting guidelines.
4. DEFINITIONS Egg White Components: The proteins found in
egg whites such as Ovalbumin, Ovotransferrin, Ovomucoid,
Lysozyme, and others relevant to the profile.
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
◦ Specimen Type: Serum
◦ Collection: Collect blood using a serum separator tube
(SST).
◦ Volume: A minimum of 5 mL of blood is recommended to
obtain sufficient serum.
◦ Transport: Samples must be transported at 2-8°C.
◦ Stability: Serum samples are stable up to 48 hours at 2-8°C.
6. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
◦ ELISA reader or specific protein analyzer
◦ Microcentrifuge
◦ Micropipettes & tips
◦ Refrigerator (2-8°C)
◦ Freezer (-20°C)
◦ Vortex mixer
◦ Incubator (if required by the assay)
◦ Assay kits specific for egg white proteins
◦ Calibrators and controls specific to the assay
7. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation - Verify the specimen, checking for proper labeling
and sample integrity. - Centrifuge the SST tube at 3000 rpm for 15
minutes to separate serum. - Aliquot the serum into labeled
microcentrifuge tubes and store at 2-8°C if analysis is to be
performed within 48 hours, otherwise store at -20°C.
B. Assay Setup - Set up the assay kit as per the manufacturer’s
instructions. - Equilibrate all reagents, samples, and controls to room
temperature before use.
C. Running the Assay - Pipette the required volume of standards,
controls, and serum samples into designated wells. - Follow the
specific steps of the assay protocol—typically involving incubation,
washing, and substrate addition. - Ensure correct use of the
microplate reader or the specific protein analyzer. Analyze the plate/
read results after following the manufacturer's protocols.
D. Data Analysis - Calculate the concentrations of egg white
components using the standard curve generated by the known
concentrations of calibrators. - Verify the quality control results fall
within the acceptable range. If not, troubleshoot and repeat the
assay.
E. Quality Control - Run quality control samples alongside patient
specimens with each assay. - QC materials should cover low,
medium, and high levels of the analyte. - Document and verify QC
results before reporting patient results.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ Review results for each analyte thoroughly.
◦ Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
ensuring accuracy and completion.
◦ Verify and release results in compliance with laboratory
guidelines.
2. REFERENCE RANGES Normal reference ranges for individual
egg white components should be verified according to the
specific assay kit’s documentation.
3. TROUBLESHOOTING
◦ Common issues include non-compliance of QC results,
invalid standard curves, or signal issues. Refer to the assay
kit troubleshooting guide.
◦ Reagent expiration: Check for expired reagents and replace
them immediately
◦ Ensure incubations and washing steps are performed
exactly as specified to avoid variability.

◦ Manufacturer’s instructions for the specific egg white
component assay kit
◦ Laboratory best practice manuals

5. DOCUMENTATION All steps, QC results, calibration data, and
patient results must be thoroughly documented in the laboratory
records as per CLIA requirements. Ensure records are kept up
to date and available for review.
