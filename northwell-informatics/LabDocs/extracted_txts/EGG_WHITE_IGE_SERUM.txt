Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Title: Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Egg White IgE, Serum
1. PURPOSE This SOP outlines the procedure for the analytical
phase of generating results for Egg White IgE in serum using
chemiluminescence or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(ELISA). It ensures consistent and accurate measurement of
IgE specific to egg white protein in patient serum samples.
2. DEFINITION Egg White IgE Analysis: A laboratory test that
quantifies the Immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibody specific to egg
white allergens in serum, which is used to determine allergic
sensitization.
3. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
Equipment:
◦ Chemiluminescent Analyzer or ELISA Reader
◦ Pipettes (calibrated)
◦ Microcentrifuge
◦ Plate Washer (if applicable for ELISA)
◦ Refrigerator/Freezer for reagent storage
Reagents:
◦ Egg White IgE detection kit (including pre-coated ELISA
plates or chemiluminescent substrates)
◦ Serum samples
◦ Calibrators and Controls
◦ Wash Buffer
◦ Substrate Solution
◦ Stop Solution (for ELISA)
◦ Diluent (if specified in the kit protocol)
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
◦ Preferred Specimen: Serum collected in a red-top or
serum separator tube (SST).
◦ Specimen Volume: Minimum 0.5 mL of serum.
◦ Specimen Handling: Ensure specimens are stored at
2-8°C if not immediately analyzed and do not exceed 48
hours. For longer storage, freeze at -20°C or below.
◦ Unacceptable Specimen: Specimens with hemolysis,
lipemia, or contamination. Ensure tubes are labeled with
correct collection date/time and patient information.
5. PROCEDURE
Pre-Analytical Steps:
◦ Check specimen integrity and volume.
◦ Label and document sample details in the laboratory
information system (LIS).
Analytical Steps:
For ELISA: a. Prepare workbench, ensuring all reagents are at
room temperature. b. Dilute serum samples and controls as
specified in the kit insert. c. Add diluted samples, calibrators,
and controls to appropriate wells of the pre-coated plate. d.
Incubate the plate as per kit instructions. e. Wash the wells with
wash buffer as specified. f. Add substrate solution to wells and
incubate. g. Add stop solution to each well and read the optical
density (OD) at a specified wavelength using an ELISA reader.
For Chemiluminescence: a. Prepare the analyzer and
reagents according to the manufacturer's specifications. b.
Load diluted serum samples, calibrators, and controls into
appropriate positions in the analyzer. c. Follow the analyzer’s
automated protocol for sample incubation and reading. d.
Ensure the analyzer processes and calculates results based on
the standard curve.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Run internal QC material as per laboratory protocol to
ensure assay reliability.
◦ Validate each new lot of reagent according to site-specific
guidelines.
◦ If QC results are outside acceptable limits, troubleshoot per
manufacturer’s recommendation and repeat QC testing.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ Verify results in the LIS.
◦ Compare the patient’s results to reference intervals:
▪ Negative: <0.35 kU/L
▪ Low Positive: 0.35-3.5 kU/L
▪ Moderate Positive: 3.5-17.5 kU/L
▪ High Positive: >17.5 kU/L
◦ Document any comments pertaining to sample integrity or
deviations observed during the analysis.
◦ Forward final verified results to the clinician for review.
