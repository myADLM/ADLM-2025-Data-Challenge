Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Egg White IgG Results
1. PURPOSE
This protocol outlines the steps for conducting the analytical phase
for the detection and quantification of Egg White IgG using an
Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) in a CLIA-certified
laboratory.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to the analytical phase of processing patient
samples that have been collected, received, and accessioned for Egg
White IgG testing.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory technologists are responsible for performing
and documenting the steps outlined in this procedure. It is the
responsibility of the lab supervisor to ensure staff follow the
procedure, including any corrective actions that may be required.

5. PROCEDURE
5.1 Sample Preparation:
a. Confirm the specimen has been accessioned correctly and is
labelled with patient identification. b. Allow serum/plasma samples to
come to room temperature before analysis. c. If the sample was
stored frozen, ensure it is fully thawed and mixed gently before use.
5.2 Reagent Preparation:
a. Prepare reagents according to the manufacturer's instructions
provided with the ELISA kit. b. Mix all reagents thoroughly before
use.
5.3 ELISA Plate Preparation:
a. Label the microplate layout for standards, controls, and patient
samples. b. Add appropriate volumes of standards, controls, and
patient samples to designated wells.
5.4 Incubation and Washing:
a. Incubate the plate as per the manufacturer's instructions (generally
1-2 hours at 37°C). b. Wash the plate multiple times using the
microplate washer with wash buffer as specified.
5.5 Detection:
a. Add the detection antibody-conjugate reagent to each well and
incubate as per the manufacturer's instructions. b. Wash the plate
again as specified after incubation.
5.6 Substrate Addition and Reaction:
a. Add the substrate solution to each well. b. Incubate in the dark for
the time specified in the kit instructions (typically 15-30 minutes).
5.7 Stopping the Reaction:
a. Add stop solution to each well to halt the enzymatic reaction. b.
Read the optical density (OD) of each well at the wavelength
specified (typically 450 nm) using the ELISA plate reader.
5.8 Data Analysis:
a. Use the plate reader software to generate a standard curve from
the known standards. b. Calculate the concentration of Egg White
IgG in patient samples by comparing their OD readings to the
standard curve.
5.9 Quality Control:
a. Run positive and negative controls with every batch of tests. b.
Ensure control results are within acceptable ranges before reporting
patient results. c. Document any deviations and corrective actions.
5.10 Reporting Results:
a. Review all results to ensure they meet quality control criteria. b.
Enter the results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS) for
verification by a technologist. c. Verify that results are correctly
transmitted to the patient’s medical record.
6. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Refer to the ELISA kit insert for specific reference intervals and
expected ranges for Egg White IgG concentration.
7. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the ELISA kit insert for limitations associated with the assay,
including potential interferences and cross-reactivities.
8. DOCUMENTATION AND RECORDKEEPING
a. Record the details of each assay run in the laboratory logbook,
including the date, time, technologist name, and any pertinent
observations. b. Maintain records of all calibrators, controls, and
patient sample results.
