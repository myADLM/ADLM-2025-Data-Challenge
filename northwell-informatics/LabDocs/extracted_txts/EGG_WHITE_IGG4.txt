Standard Operating Procedure(SOP) for EGG WHITE IGG4
Analysis
1. PURPOSE
This procedure outlines the steps involved in the analysis of EGG
WHITE IGG4 in patient serum samples. This ensures that results are
consistent, accurate, and reliable.
2. SCOPE
This protocol applies to all laboratory personnel who are trained and
certified to perform the EGG WHITE IGG4 analysis in a CLIA-
certified laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
i. Laboratory Technologists: Responsible for performing the EGG
WHITE IGG4 test, documenting results, and reporting any anomalies.
ii. Laboratory Supervisor: Responsible for reviewing the test results,
validating the documentation, and ensuring the equipment is
functioning correctly.
4. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
i. ELISA Reader ii. Centrifuge iii. Pipettes and Tips iv. Microplate
Washer v. Incubator vi. Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) vii.
EGG WHITE IGG4 ELISA Kit (including all supplied reagents)
5. PROCEDURE
5.1 Pre-analysis
i. Ensure that the specimens are serum samples stored at
appropriate conditions (-20°C or colder) and that they are not
hemolyzed. ii. Thaw serum samples to room temperature, ensuring
no direct heat exposure is applied.
5.2 Reagent Preparation
i. Reconstitute the reagents from the EGG WHITE IGG4 ELISA Kit as
per the manufacturer’s instructions. ii. Prepare wash buffer and HRP
conjugate shortly before starting the procedure to ensure they are
fresh.
5.3 Sample and Standard Preparation
i. Dilute the serum samples and standards as specified in the
supplier’s instructions. ii. Ensure all samples, standards, and blanks
are prepared in duplicate.
5.4 Assay Procedure
i. Pipette the appropriate volume of standards, controls, and samples
into designated wells. ii. Add the biotinylated antibody to each well
and incubate at room temperature for 1 hour, ensuring uniform
mixing. iii. Wash the microplate wells with the wash buffer to remove
unbound antibodies. iv. Add HRP conjugate to each well, and
incubate at room temperature as per the manufacturer’s instruction.
v. Wash the wells extensively to ensure proper removal of unbound
conjugates. vi. Add the TMB substrate to each well and incubate in
the dark at room temperature until the color develops (as per the kit
instructions). vii. Add the stop solution to halt the reaction.
5.5 Measurement
i. Measure the optical density (OD) of each well using an ELISA
reader at the appropriate wavelength (usually 450 nm). ii. Record the
readings and ensure they are within the expected range for
standards and blanks.
5.6 Calculations and Results Interpretation
i. Generate a standard curve using the OD readings of the standards.
ii. Calculate the EGG WHITE IGG4 concentration in each sample
using the generated standard curve. iii. Document all findings and
ensure that calculations are accurate.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
i. Run quality control samples with each batch of patient samples to
ensure the assay’s validity. ii. Acceptable quality control result ranges
must be predefined and used to validate the assay performance.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
i. Ensure results are reviewed and validated by the laboratory
supervisor before reporting. ii. Any anomalies or deviations must be
documented and investigated. iii. Report the final EGG WHITE IGG4
results in the laboratory information system (LIS) according to site-
specific guidelines.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
i. Any hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples should be rejected, as
they may interfere with the assay's accuracy. ii. Cross-reactivity with
other IgG subclasses must be considered and documented if
applicable.

10. DOCUMENTATION
All steps undertaken must be documented in the laboratory notebook
or electronic data management systems with proper date, time, and
initials of the performing technologist.
11. TROUBLESHOOTING
Refer to the manufacturer’s troubleshooting guide for any assay-
specific issues. Contact the laboratory supervisor if unexpected
results or instrumentation issues arise that cannot be resolved
through standard troubleshooting procedures.
This SOP ensures that the generation of results for EGG WHITE
IGG4 is standardized and complies with the highest quality and
accuracy standards for patient care.
