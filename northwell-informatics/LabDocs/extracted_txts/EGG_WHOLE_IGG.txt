Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) for the Analytical Phase
of Generating Results for EGG WHOLE IGG
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this protocol is to outline the steps and procedures
required for the accurate analysis and reporting of EGG WHOLE IGG
levels in patient specimens. This SOP ensures standardized and
reproducible results in compliance with CLIA regulations.
Responsibility:
• Trained laboratory personnel are responsible for performing the
analysis as defined in this procedure.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring that staff adhere to this
SOP and address any issues that arise.
• It is the user's responsibility to report any deviations from this
protocol to the supervisor promptly.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Acceptable Specimens:
• Serum: 4-5 mL collected in a red-top tube or serum separator
tube (SST).
• Plasma: 4-5 mL collected in a heparin or EDTA tube.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric specimens may interfere with
results.
• Specimens collected in sodium citrate or sodium fluoride tubes
are not acceptable.
Specimen Stability:
• Specimens should be processed within 2 hours of collection. If
processing is delayed, specimens should be stored at 2-8°C and
analyzed within 48 hours.
• For longer storage, specimens should be frozen at -20°C or lower.
Specimen Handling:
• After collection, allow serum to clot for 30 minutes before
centrifugation.
• Separate serum or plasma promptly from cells and transfer to a
labeled storage tube.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• ELISA Reader (Photo Spectrometer)
• Calibrated Pipettes and Tips
• Vortex Mixer
• Incubator (37°C)
• ELISA Kit for EGG WHOLE IGG (including controls and
standards)
• Distilled Water
• Disposable Gloves, Lab Coats, and Safety Goggles
4. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation:
1. Reagent Preparation:
◦ Follow the manufacturer’s instructions to prepare working
solutions of the provided reagents (e.g., wash buffer,
substrate solution).
◦ Prepare standards and controls as directed in the assay kit
insert.
2. ELISA Plate Preparation:
◦ Label all required wells clearly.
◦ Include duplicate wells for standards, controls, and patient
samples on each plate.
B. Assay Procedure:
1. Add 100 µL of standards, controls, and diluted patient samples
to the designated wells.
2. Incubate the ELISA plate at room temperature (RT) or as
specified, usually around 1-2 hours.
3. Wash the plate 3-5 times with the provided wash buffer to
remove unbound materials.
4. Add 100 µL of enzyme conjugate to each well and incubate at
RT for the specified time.
5. Wash the plate again 3-5 times to remove excess conjugate.
6. Add 100 µL of substrate solution to each well.
7. Incubate in the dark for the specified time, usually 10-30
minutes or until optimal color development is reached.
8. Add 100 µL of stop solution to each well to halt the reaction.
C. Read and Interpret Results:
1. Read the absorbance at the specified wavelength using an
ELISA reader (typically 450 nm).
2. Analyze and record the results, ensuring control values fall
within the acceptable range.
3. Interpret the patient results based on the standard curve.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run internal quality control samples with each assay batch.
• Ensure all QC samples are within acceptable limits before patient
results are released.
• Document any deviations from expected QC values, investigate,
and take corrective actions as necessary.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results are to be reported in accordance with site-specific
reporting guidelines.
• Ensure all patient identifiers and test results are accurate before
verification.
• Critical values must be communicated to the requesting physician
immediately as per the laboratory’s critical value policy.
7. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Factors such as hemolysis, lipemia, and icterus can interfere with
the assay.
• Cross-reactivity with other immunoglobulins may lead to false
results.
• Refer to manufacturer’s insert for more specific limitations related
to the ELISA kit.

9. REVISION HISTORY
• Version 1.0 (October 2023) - Original SOP Drafted.
By following this SOP, laboratory personnel can ensure accurate and
consistent results for EGG WHOLE IGG analysis, maintaining
compliance with regulatory standards. Adjust any specific procedures
as needed in accordance with the ELISA kit manufacturer’s
instructions.
