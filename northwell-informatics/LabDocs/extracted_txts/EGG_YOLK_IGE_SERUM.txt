Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results: EGG YOLK, IGE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
To provide a systematic approach for the processing and analysis of
Egg Yolk Immunoglobulin E (IgE) in serum samples, ensuring
accuracy, reliability, and consistency of test results.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of designated laboratory staff to adhere to this
procedure, perform analyses as described, and document results
accordingly. Any deviations or issues encountered during the process
must be reported to the supervisor immediately.
1. DEFINITIONS
Egg Yolk, IgE: An immunological test performed to determine the
level of IgE antibodies specific to egg yolk in a patient's serum.
Elevated levels may indicate an allergic response to egg yolk.
1. PROCEDURE
Specimens:
• Preferred/acceptable: Serum samples collected in SST (serum
separator tube) or red-top tubes.
• Unacceptable: Hemolyzed samples, lipemic samples, and
samples with insufficient volume.
Sample Preparation:
1. Upon receipt, allow serum samples to clot for a minimum of 30
minutes at room temperature.
2. Centrifuge the samples at 1,500 – 2,000 x g for 10 minutes to
separate the serum from the clot.
3. Carefully transfer the serum to a labeled secondary tube,
avoiding any cellular debris.
4. If not analyzed immediately, store serum samples at 2-8°C for
up to 48 hours, or freeze at -20°C for longer storage.
Materials and Equipment:
• ELISA (Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay) Kit specific for
Egg Yolk IgE
• Microplate reader capable of reading at 450 nm
• Pipettes and tips
• Incubator (37°C)
• Wash buffer
• Substrate solution
• Stop solution
Reagents:
• Calibrators/Standards
• Controls
• Antigen-coated microplates
• Conjugate solution
Analytical Procedure:
1. Calibration and Quality Control:
◦ Run calibrators and controls according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
◦ Ensure that quality control results fall within the established
ranges before proceeding with patient samples.
2. Assay Procedure: a. Pipette the required volume of calibrators,
controls, and patient serum samples into the appropriate wells
of the antigen-coated microplate. b. Add the enzyme conjugate
to each well. c. Incubate the plate at 37°C for the specified time
as per the kit instructions. d. Wash the plate to remove unbound
materials using the provided wash buffer. e. Add the substrate
solution to each well and incubate for the time specified in the
kit instructions. f. Add the stop solution to each well to halt the
enzymatic reaction. g. Read the optical density (OD) of each
well using a microplate reader set to 450 nm.
3. Calculations:
◦ Construct a standard curve using the OD values of the
calibrators.
◦ Determine the concentration of Egg Yolk IgE in patient
samples by interpolation from the standard curve.
Quality Control:
1. Run quality control samples with each batch of patient tests.
2. Document all quality control results and any corrective actions
required if QC results fall outside the established ranges.
3. Ensure that all critical reagents and instruments are calibrated
and validated according to the laboratory's quality assurance
program.
Reporting Results:
• Document the test results in the laboratory information system
(LIS).
• Ensure the results are reviewed and verified by a qualified
technologist before releasing them.
• Refer to site-specific reporting guidelines for handling critical or
unexpected results.
Reference Intervals:
• Negative: < 0.35 kU/L
• Borderline: 0.35 – 0.70 kU/L
• Positive: > 0.70 kU/L
Method Limitations:
• Interferences may occur due to hemolysis, lipemia, or the
presence of rheumatoid factors.
• Follow the kit insert for specific limitations regarding the sensitivity
and specificity of the assay.

*Note: Staff must undergo proper training and competency
assessments for the analytical procedure of Egg Yolk IgE, and attend
regular reviews of the SOP to ensure adherence and proficiency.
