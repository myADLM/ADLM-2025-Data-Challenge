Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Egg Yolk IgG
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this protocol is to provide standardized procedures
for the measurement of Egg Yolk IgG (Immunoglobulin G) in patient
samples using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) within
the laboratory. This ensures accurate, reliable, and reproducible test
results.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory technologists are responsible for
conducting the test, from sample preparation to result calculation
and reporting.
• Supervisors are accountable for ensuring compliance with this
SOP and for reviewing the results as part of the quality control
process.
1. DEFINITION
Egg Yolk IgG is an immunoglobulin that indicates allergic sensitivity
or immunity response related to egg yolk. It is typically measured in
serum or plasma samples using the ELISA technique.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred Specimen: Serum or plasma
• Minimum Volume: 100 µL
• Collection Containers: Serum separator tube (SST) or EDTA/
heparin vacutainers for plasma.
• Sample Stability:
◦ Room temperature: 24 hours
◦ 2-8°C: 7 days
◦ -20°C: 1 year (Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles)
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• ELISA Microplate Reader
• Micropipettes with tips (10 µL to 1000 µL)
• ELISA Kit for Egg Yolk IgG (contains the following):
◦ Coated microplate
◦ Wash buffer
◦ Substrate solution
◦ Stop solution
◦ Control samples (positive and negative)
◦ Calibrators
◦ Sample diluent
• Plate washer (automatic or manual)
• Distilled or deionized water
1. PROCEDURE
2. Pre-Analysis Checks:
◦ Verify the integrity and labeling of the patient samples.
◦ Ensure all reagents are within their expiry dates and stored
according to manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Prepare all necessary equipment including the ELISA
Microplate Reader and ensure it is calibrated.
3. Sample Preparation:
◦ Thaw the samples at room temperature (~22-25°C) if
previously frozen.
◦ Prepare sample dilutions using the provided sample diluent
as per the ELISA kit instructions.
4. Assay Procedure:
1. Add 100 µL of calibrators, controls, and diluted patient
samples into the designated wells of the coated
microplate.
2. Incubate the plate as per the kit instructions (usually 1-2
hours) at room temperature.
3. Wash the plate four times with wash buffer to remove
unbound materials.
4. Add 100 µL of the enzyme-linked antibody specific to IgG
to each well. Incubate as per the instructions.
5. Repeat the washing step.
6. Add 100 µL of substrate solution to each well and
incubate in the dark for the specified time.
7. Add 50 µL stop solution to each well to terminate the
reaction.
8. Read the optical density (OD) of each well using an
ELISA Microplate Reader at the appropriate wavelength
(usually 450nm).
5. Data Analysis:
◦ Using the OD readings, generate a standard curve from the
calibrators.
◦ Determine the concentration of Egg Yolk IgG in the patient
samples by comparing their OD readings to the standard
curve using ELISA data analysis software.
6. Quality Control:
◦ Run positive and negative controls with each batch of
samples.
◦ Accept the run only if the controls are within the specified
ranges.
◦ Document all control results and take corrective actions if
controls are out of range.
7. RESULT REPORTING
• Results should be expressed in Units/mL (U/mL) or as specified
by the ELISA kit manufacturer.
• Verify and validate all results through a secondary review process
by a designated supervisor.
• Enter the results into the laboratory information system (LIS) for
reporting and record keeping.
Critical Results:
• Immediate notification to the physician or clinical team if Egg Yolk
IgG levels exceed critical values, as per the laboratory’s defined
threshold.
