Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for EHLERS-DANLOS
SYNDROME GENE PANEL, VARIES
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the step-by-step procedures for
the analytical phase of generating results for Ehlers-Danlos
Syndrome (EDS) Gene Panel testing. Accurate and timely results are
crucial for diagnosing and understanding EDS genetic variants to
guide appropriate patient management.
Responsibility: It is the responsibility of laboratory technologists to
perform the testing following this SOP and ensure all results are
accurately reported. Supervisors are responsible for overseeing the
process, addressing any issues, and ensuring quality control (QC).
1. DEFINITIONS
Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS): A group of heritable connective
tissue disorders characterized by joint hypermobility, skin
hyperextensibility, and tissue fragility.
Gene Panel: A predefined set of genes associated with a specific
condition or group of conditions.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• DNA extraction kit (approved kit in use)
• PCR instrument and reagents
• Next-Generation Sequencer (NGS) and reagents (platform-
specific e.g., Illumina, Ion Torrent)
• Laboratory Information System (LIS)
• Computer with bioinformatics software (platform-specific)
• Quality control materials (positive, negative, and no-template
controls)
1. PROCEDURE
4.1 Sample Preparation and DNA Extraction
• Verify specimen identity using the LIS.
• Extract DNA from the patient's specimen using the approved DNA
extraction kit.
• Quantify and assess the quality of extracted DNA.
• Document DNA concentration and quality metrics in LIS.
4.2 Library Preparation for NGS
• Use the specific protocol for library preparation suitable for the
NGS platform in use.
• Prepare the library using the target enrichment method specified
for the EDS gene panel.
• Include positive, negative, and no-template controls.
• Quantify and assess the quality of libraries.
4.3 Next-Generation Sequencing
• Load the prepared libraries onto the NGS instrument per
manufacturer's recommendations.
• Start the sequencing run and monitor progress.
• Include appropriate quality controls.
4.4 Data Analysis and Interpretation
• Transfer raw sequencing data to bioinformatics analysis software.
• Perform data analysis including alignment, variant calling, and
annotation using validated pipelines.
• Review quality metrics for the sequencing data.
• Classify variants based on established criteria (e.g., ACMG
guidelines).
4.5 Result Validation and Reporting
• Validate identified variants through a secondary method if
necessary (e.g., Sanger Sequencing).
• Review all findings with a second qualified technologist or
supervisor.
• Interpret results within the clinical context. Consult genetic
specialists if necessary.
• Document results and interpretations in the LIS.
4.6 Quality Control and Assurance
• Perform quality control (QC) on each batch of samples, including
controls.
• Ensure all QC results are within acceptable limits before releasing
patient results.
• Document all QC procedures and any corrective actions taken in
the LIS.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results should be reviewed, interpreted, and signed off by a
qualified laboratory supervisor.
• Ensure accurate and concise reporting, including clinical
significance.
• Report all findings in compliance with institutional, regulatory, and
accreditation standards.
• Disseminate results to the referring clinician through LIS or other
approved media.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS AND LIMITATIONS
• Reference population frequencies will be used for interpreting
variants.
• Known limitations and coverage gaps should be clearly
communicated.
1. CORRECTIVE ACTIONS
• Document any deviations or issues encountered during the
process.
• Notify supervisor immediately and undertake corrective actions.
• Make relevant amendments to the SOP if necessary after
validation and approval.
1. REFERENCES
• Current literature and guidelines relevant to Ehlers-Danlos
Syndrome genetic testing.

This protocol will be regularly reviewed and updated based on
advances in technology and updated guidelines. All laboratory
personnel must ensure they are familiar with and follow the most
current version of the protocol at all times.
