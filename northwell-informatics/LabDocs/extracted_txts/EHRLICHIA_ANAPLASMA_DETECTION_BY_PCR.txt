Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Detection of Ehrlichia/
Anaplasma by PCR
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for the qualitative detection of Ehrlichia/
Anaplasma DNA in clinical specimens using polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) in order to provide accurate and timely results for
patient diagnosis and treatment.
Responsibility:
• It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory personnel to
perform the PCR assay as described in this SOP.
• It is the responsibility of the laboratory supervisor to ensure the
process adheres to the SOP and any necessary corrective actions
are taken.
1. DEFINITION
Ehrlichia and Anaplasma are genera of bacteria that cause
ehrlichiosis and anaplasmosis, respectively. These infections can be
detected by amplifying specific DNA sequences through PCR.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred Specimens:
• Whole blood collected in EDTA (lavender-top tube) or other
appropriate anticoagulant.
• Bone marrow aspirate in EDTA.
Specimen Stability:
• Store whole blood specimens at 2-8°C if testing will be performed
within 48 hours of collection.
• For long-term storage (>48 hours), freeze samples at -20°C or
below.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens collected in heparin or other anticoagulants not
specified.
• Specimens with excessive hemolysis, clotted specimens, or
improperly labeled specimens.
• Samples received without collection date/time.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• PCR thermocycler
• DNA extraction kit
• PCR reagents and master mix components
• Primers and probes specific for Ehrlichia/Anaplasma
• Nuclease-free water
• Microcentrifuge tubes
• Pipettes and aerosol-resistant tips
• Positive and negative PCR controls
• PCR sample preparation area
• Laboratory coat, gloves, and other personal protective equipment
(PPE)
1. PROCEDURE
5.1 DNA Extraction
• Follow the DNA extraction kit protocol to isolate and purify DNA
from clinical specimens.
• Ensure the extraction process includes appropriate controls to
monitor extraction efficiency.
• Store extracted DNA at 4°C if using immediately or at -20°C if
there will be a delay.
5.2 PCR Master Mix Preparation
• Prepare the PCR master mix in a clean dedicated area to prevent
contamination.
• The master mix typically includes DNA polymerase, dNTPs,
primers, probes, buffer, and nuclease-free water.
Example Master Mix Preparation:
• Add the following components into a clean microcentrifuge tube:
◦ PCR buffer: 2.5 µL per reaction
◦ dNTP mix: 0.5 µL per reaction
◦ Forward primer: 0.5 µL per reaction
◦ Reverse primer: 0.5 µL per reaction
◦ Probe: 0.5 µL per reaction
◦ DNA polymerase: 0.2 µL per reaction
◦ Nuclease-free water: To a final volume of 25 µL per reaction
5.3 Amplification
• Aliquot 23 µL of the master mix to each labeled PCR tube or well.
• Add 2 µL of extracted DNA from each sample, positive control,
and negative control to the respective tubes.
• Place tubes into the PCR thermocycler and run the following
cycling conditions:
Example Cycling Conditions:
• Initial denaturation: 95°C for 10 minutes
• Denaturation: 95°C for 15 seconds
• Annealing: 60°C for 1 minute
• Extension: 72°C for 30 seconds
• Final extension: 72°C for 5 minutes
• Hold: 4°C (until samples can be analyzed)
5.4 Detection and Analysis
• Analyze the PCR products using the appropriate detection system
(e.g., gel electrophoresis or real-time PCR detection system).
• Compare the fluorescence or band patterns from the clinical
specimens to the positive and negative controls.
5.5 Interpretation of Results
• Positive result: Specific amplification of target DNA observed (with
expected fluorescence levels or bands) in clinical specimens.
• Negative result: No amplification of target DNA observed (no
fluorescence or bands) in clinical specimens.
• Invalid result: Amplification observed in the negative control or no
signal in the positive control, indicating potential contamination or
assay failure.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include a positive control (known Ehrlichia/Anaplasma DNA) and
a negative control (nuclease-free water) in each PCR run.
• Regularly review control results to ensure assay performance and
reliability.
• If quality control results are out of range, repeat the assay and
investigate the cause of the failure.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Document and review all results before reporting.
• Enter results into the laboratory information system (LIS) or
electronic health record (EHR) system as per laboratory protocol.
• Notify the appropriate clinician immediately if a positive result is
obtained.
1. REFERENCES
• Current literature and guidelines for PCR-based detection of
Ehrlichia/Anaplasma.
• DNA extraction kit instructions.
• PCR thermocycler manual.
By following this SOP, laboratory personnel will ensure consistent
and accurate detection of Ehrlichia and Anaplasma DNA in clinical
specimens, providing critical information for the diagnosis and
treatment of infections.
