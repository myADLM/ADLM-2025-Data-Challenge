SOP: Molecular Detection of Ehrlichia/Anaplasma by PCR from
Blood Samples
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized protocol for the detection of Ehrlichia and
Anaplasma species in blood samples using Polymerase Chain
Reaction (PCR) methodology, ensuring accurate and reliable results
to inform patient diagnosis and treatment.
1. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel performing
molecular detection of Ehrlichia and Anaplasma species from blood
samples in a CLIA-certified laboratory.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
• Laboratory technologists are responsible for following this
protocol and ensuring all quality control measures are adhered to
during the molecular detection process.
• Supervisors are responsible for overseeing the implementation of
this protocol and ensuring compliance and accuracy.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Acceptable: Blood sample collected in EDTA tubes.
• Unacceptable: Hemolyzed samples, blood samples not stored or
transported under appropriate conditions, samples collected in
heparin, or samples that are not labeled correctly.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Thermocycler (PCR machine)
• DNA extraction kits
• PCR Master Mix
• Primers and probes specific for Ehrlichia and Anaplasma species
• Nuclease-free water
• Positive control (known Ehrlichia/Anaplasma DNA)
• Negative control (H2O or buffer)
• Pipettes and tips
• Vortex and centrifuge
• Gel electrophoresis apparatus (if applicable)
1. PROCEDURE
A) DNA Extraction
1. Specimen Preparation
◦ Use aseptic techniques to avoid contamination.
◦ Label tubes clearly with patient identification and laboratory
accession number.
◦ Mix blood samples by gentle inversion.
2. Extraction Method
◦ Use the DNA extraction kit as per the manufacturer’s
instructions.
◦ Add appropriate volumes of blood to the extraction
reagents.
◦ Incubate, wash, and elute the DNA as directed.
◦ Store extracted DNA at 2-8°C if proceeding within the same
day or at -20°C for longer storage.
B) PCR Setup
1. Preparation of the Master Mix
◦ Thaw all reagents and samples on ice before use.
◦ Prepare a PCR Master Mix according to the following
example proportions (adjust per manufacturer’s guide):
▪ Nuclease-free water: X µL
▪ PCR buffer: X µL
▪ MgCl2: X µL
▪ dNTPs: X µL
▪ Forward primer: X µL
▪ Reverse primer: X µL
▪ Probe (if using real-time PCR): X µL
▪ Taq Polymerase: X µL
▪ Template DNA (patient sample): X µL
▪ Total Volume per reaction: X µL
2. Pipetting the Master Mix
◦ Aliquot the prepared Master Mix into PCR tubes.
◦ Add the extracted DNA (template) to the tubes.
◦ Include positive and negative controls in each run.
3. PCR Amplification
◦ Program the thermocycler with the following example
conditions:
▪ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 2 minutes
▪ 40 cycles of:
▪ Denaturation: 95°C for 15 seconds
▪ Annealing: 55°C for 30 seconds
▪ Extension: 72°C for 30 seconds
◦ Adjust conditions as appropriate for specific primers and
probes.
4. Post-PCR Analysis
◦ If using endpoint PCR, analyze PCR products via gel
electrophoresis. Load sample and run in a gel alongside a
DNA ladder.
◦ Visualize bands under UV light to determine the presence of
target DNA (expected band size per species).
◦ For real-time PCR, analyze data via the thermocycler’s
software.
C) Interpretation of Results
1. Positive Control
◦ The positive control should yield a specific band (gel
electrophoresis) or a specific Ct value (real-time PCR).
2. Negative Control
◦ The negative control should show no amplification to rule
out contamination.
3. Patient Samples
◦ Compare patient sample bands/Ct values with controls.
◦ Positive result: Presence of specific amplification.
◦ Negative result: Absence of specific amplification.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform environmental controls (e.g., wipe work surfaces with
10% bleach followed by 70% ethanol).
• Include positive and negative controls in every PCR run.
• If controls do not perform as expected, invalidate the run and
repeat the process.
• Document all steps and deviations meticulously.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Record all results in the laboratory information system (LIS).
• Report positive results under “Detected for Ehrlichia/Anaplasma
DNA.”
• Report negative results under “Not Detected for Ehrlichia/
Anaplasma DNA.”
• Notify the requesting physician promptly for positive or
inconclusive results, following site-specific guidelines.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Expected result for non-infected individuals: “Not Detected for
Ehrlichia/Anaplasma DNA.”
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Sensitivity of PCR may be affected by the quality of the DNA
extraction.
• Contamination can lead to false positives.
• Negative results do not exclude the possibility of infection if the
pathogen load is below the detection threshold.
1. REFERENCES
List references to specific DNA extraction kits, PCR mix, and
thermocycler manuals, and any relevant clinical guidelines regarding
molecular detection of Ehrlichia/Anaplasma.
By following the above protocol, the laboratory ensures the accurate
and reliable detection of Ehrlichia and Anaplasma DNA in blood
samples, aiding in effective clinical decision-making.
By implementing these steps, the laboratory meets CLIA standards
for quality and precision in molecular testing.
