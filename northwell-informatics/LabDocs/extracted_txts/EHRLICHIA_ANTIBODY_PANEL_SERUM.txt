Standard Operating Procedure for Ehrlichia Antibody Panel, Serum
1. PURPOSE
To ensure accurate, reliable, and timely detection of Ehrlichia
antibodies in serum samples for diagnostic purposes in the
laboratory.
1. DEFINITION
Ehrlichia antibodies are specific proteins produced by the immune
system in response to infection by the Ehrlichia bacteria.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/acceptable:
• 5 mL of serum collected in a red-top or SST (serum separator
tube).
• Specimens should be spun down and separated from cells within
2 hours of collection.
Unacceptable:
• Specimens collected in EDTA, heparin, or any anticoagulants.
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
• Specimens without proper labeling (patient name, date/time of
collection).
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Ehrlichia Antibody Test Kit
• Microplate Reader
• Pipettes and tips
• Serum separator tubes or red-top tubes
• Calibration controls
• Incubator
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation
1. Verify the integrity of the serum sample. Ensure it is not
hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric.
2. Allow sample tube to reach room temperature prior to testing.
B. Assay Setup
1. Follow the Ehrlichia Antibody Test Kit instructions for preparing
reagents and controls.
2. Pipette the appropriate volume of serum into designated wells
on the microplate according to kit instructions.
3. Add reagent as per the test kit instructions to each well
containing sample or control.
4. Incubate the microplate at the temperature specified by the test
kit instructions and for the recommended duration.
5. Wash the microplate thoroughly according to the kit
instructions.
C. Detection
1. Apply the final detection reagent to the wells as per kit
instructions.
2. Incubate the microplate again if required.
3. Read the absorbance using the microplate reader at the
wavelength specified by the kit instructions.
D. Interpretation of Results
1. Record the absorbance values.
2. Compare the absorbance of the samples to the controls as per
the test kit instructions.
3. Positive results indicate the presence of Ehrlichia antibodies.
4. Negative results indicate the absence of Ehrlichia antibodies.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
A. Material:
• Calibration controls included in the Ehrlichia Antibody Test Kit.
• Two levels of serum controls (positive control and negative
control).
B. Procedure:
1. Run positive and negative controls with every batch of patient
samples.
2. Record control results in the quality control log.
3. Ensure controls are within the acceptable range defined by the
kit manufacturer.
4. If controls fail, do not report patient results and troubleshoot the
assay.
5. REPORTING RESULTS
6. Document and review all results.
7. Verify the results manually before entering into the Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
8. Ensure positive and negative results are correctly interpreted
and reported.
9. If the sample integrity is in question, repeat the test with a new
aliquot or troubleshoot according to lab protocols.
10. Results are automatically transmitted from the LIS to the
Electronic Health Record (EHR) for physician review.
11. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Negative: No detectable Ehrlichia antibodies.
• Positive: Detectable Ehrlichia antibodies indicating possible
exposure to or infection with Ehrlichia bacteria.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to the Ehrlichia Antibody Test Kit insert for individual assay
limitations.
• Ensure cross-reactivity with other similar infections has been
considered according to the kit instructions.
