Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for EHRLICHIA/BABESIA
ANTIBODY PANEL, IMMUNOFLUORESCENCE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE This procedure outlines the steps and guidelines for
performing the Ehrlichia/Babesia Antibody Panel by
Immunofluorescence Assay (IFA) to detect antibodies in serum
samples.
2. SCOPE This SOP applies to all qualified laboratory personnel
performing the Ehrlichia/Babesia Antibody Panel testing within
the laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY It is the responsibility of all laboratory
personnel to follow the procedures outlined in this SOP to
ensure the accuracy and reliability of test results. Training is
mandatory before performing this test.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND HANDLING 4.1 Accepted
Specimen Type:
◦ Serum: 3-5 mL collected in a serum separator tube (SST).
4.2 Unacceptable Specimens: - Specimens in anticoagulant tubes. -
Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples. - Samples that have been
frozen and thawed more than once.
4.3 Storage and Stability: - Serum samples can be stored at 2-8°C for
up to 7 days. For longer storage, freeze at -20°C. - Avoid repeated
freeze-thaw cycles.
1. REAGENTS AND MATERIALS 5.1 Required Reagents:
◦ Ehrlichia chaffeensis, Ehrlichia ewingii, and Babesia microti
antigen slides.
◦ PBS (phosphate-buffered saline).
◦ Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-human
IgG.
◦ Mounting medium.
5.2 Supplies and Equipment: - Microscope slides and coverslips. -
Humidified chamber. - Pipettes and tips. - Fluorescence microscope
with appropriate filters. - Test tubes and racks. - Incubator set to
37°C. - Laboratory timer.
1. QUALITY CONTROL 6.1 Quality Control Material:
◦ Positive and negative control sera.
6.2 Quality Control Procedure: - Each batch of tests must include
positive and negative control sera. - Controls must fall within
acceptable ranges before proceeding with the patient sample
analysis. - Document control results in the QC log.
1. PROCEDURE 7.1 Preparation of Slides:
◦ Allow all reagents and samples to reach room temperature.
◦ Label slides appropriately with patient ID and control
identifiers.
7.2 Serum Dilution: - Dilute patient serum and controls 1:64 in PBS. -
Mix thoroughly and apply 10 µL of diluted serum onto each well of the
antigen slide (one well for each antigen).
7.3 Incubation: - Place the slides in a humidified chamber and
incubate at 37°C for 30 minutes.
7.4 Washing: - Rinse the slides gently with PBS to remove unbound
antibodies. - Immerse the slides in a PBS wash bath for 5 minutes.
Repeat the wash step two more times.
7.5 FITC-Conjugated Anti-Human IgG: - Apply 10 µL of FITC-
conjugated anti-human IgG to each well. - Incubate the slides at 37°C
for 30 minutes in a humidified chamber.
7.6 Washing: - Repeat washing steps as detailed in section 7.4 to
remove unbound conjugates.
7.7 Mounting: - Apply a small drop of mounting medium to each slide
and cover with a coverslip. - Avoid bubble formation underneath the
coverslip.
7.8 Examination: - Examine the slides under a fluorescence
microscope. - Compare fluorescence intensity to the positive and
negative controls. - Grade the fluorescence intensity using the
laboratory’s standard grading criteria.
1. RESULTS AND REPORTING 8.1 Reading and Interpretation:
◦ Positive Result: Specific fluorescence observed in the wells
corresponding to Ehrlichia or Babesia antigens.
◦ Negative Result: No specific fluorescence observed.
◦ Report results for each sample as positive or negative,
including the endpoint titer for any positive results.
8.2 Documentation: - Ensure all results are accurately recorded in the
laboratory information system (LIS). - Include details of any
unexpected findings or issues in the test run.
8.3 Result Verification: - All test results must be reviewed and verified
by a qualified technologist before release. - Critical and unexpected
results must be communicated to the requesting physician as per
laboratory policy.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Frozen specimens should be thawed only once; repeated freezing
and thawing affects antibody stability.
• Cross-reactivity may occur; clinical correlation recommended for
definitive diagnosis.
1. REFERENCES
• Package insert included with Ehrlichia/Babesia Antibody IFA kits.
• Standard IFA methodology texts and guidelines.
1. REVIEW AND REVISION
• This SOP is subject to annual review, updates, and approval by
the laboratory management team.
