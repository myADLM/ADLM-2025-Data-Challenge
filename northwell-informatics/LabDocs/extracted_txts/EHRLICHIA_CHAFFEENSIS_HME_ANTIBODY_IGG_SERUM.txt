Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
1. PURPOSE
This SOP defines the procedures to be followed for the determination
of Ehrlichia chaffeensis (HME) antibody, IgG, in serum specimens.
The method involves the use of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay (ELISA) or indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) test to detect the
presence of specific IgG antibodies against Ehrlichia chaffeensis in
human serum. The results generated will aid in the diagnosis of
human monocytic ehrlichiosis (HME).
1. SPECIMEN
Preferred/acceptable:
• Serum: A minimum of 1 mL serum collected in a red-top or serum
separator tube (SST).
Unacceptable:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or grossly contaminated specimens.
• Specimens collected in non-serum tubes (e.g., EDTA, heparin).
• Specimens with less than 0.5 mL serum.
1. REAGENTS AND MATERIALS
• Ehrlichia chaffeensis antigen-coated microtiter plates or
commercially available ELISA/IFA test kits.
• Enzyme conjugate solution (e.g., anti-human IgG conjugated with
horseradish peroxidase or a fluorophore such as FITC).
• Wash buffer (phosphate-buffered saline with Tween-20).
• Substrate solution (e.g., tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) for ELISA or
glycerol for IFA).
• Stop solution (e.g., sulfuric acid for ELISA).
• Positive and negative control sera.
• Plate reader capable of measuring absorbance at 450 nm (for
ELISA) or fluorescence microscope (for IFA).
• Micropipettes and sterile tips.
• Distilled or deionized water.
• Laboratory timer.
• Incubator set at 37°C.
• Humidity chamber (optional for IFA).
1. EQUIPMENT
• Micropipettes
• Incubator (37°C)
• ELISA plate reader
• Fluorescence microscope (for IFA)
• Serum separator tubes (SST)
• Disposable gloves, lab coat, and other appropriate PPE
1. PROCEDURE
A. General Guidelines
1. Follow universal precautions and appropriate biosafety
measures while handling specimens.
2. Ensure all reagents and materials are at room temperature
before use.
3. Wear appropriate PPE at all times.
B. ELISA Procedure
1. Add 100 µL of diluted serum sample (1:100 in sample buffer) to
each well of the antigen-coated microtiter plate.
2. Add 100 µL of positive and negative control sera to all their
respective wells.
3. Incubate the plate at 37°C for 1 hour.
4. Wash the wells 3-5 times with wash buffer to remove unbound
antibodies.
5. Add 100 µL of enzyme conjugate solution to each well.
6. Incubate the plate at 37°C for 30 minutes.
7. Wash the wells 3-5 times with wash buffer.
8. Add 100 µL of substrate solution to each well.
9. Incubate the plate in the dark at room temperature for 15
minutes.
10. Add stop solution (100 µL of 1M sulfuric acid) to each well to
terminate the reaction.
11. Measure the absorbance at 450 nm using a plate reader.
C. IFA Procedure
1. Add 20 µL of diluted serum sample (1:64 in PBS) to individual
wells of the antigen-coated slide.
2. Add 20 µL of positive and negative control sera to their
respective wells.
3. Incubate the slide in a humidified chamber at 37°C for 30
minutes.
4. Wash the slides 3 times with wash buffer followed by a rinse in
distilled water.
5. Add 20 µL of fluorescence-labelled secondary antibody to each
well.
6. Incubate the slide in a humidified chamber at 37°C for 30
minutes.
7. Wash the slides as previously described.
8. Mount the slide using glycerol or an appropriate mounting
medium.
9. Examine the slide under a fluorescence microscope, checking
for specific staining patterns indicative of Ehrlichia chaffeensis
IgG antibody presence.
10. QUALITY CONTROL
11. Positive and negative controls must be included with each run
to ensure test validity.
12. Repeat testing if controls do not perform as expected.
13. Verify calibration of ELISA plate reader and fluorescence
microscope periodically.
14. REPORTING RESULTS
15. ELISA: Determine antibody presence based on the optical
density (OD) readings compared to controls. Report results as
positive if OD readings are significantly higher than negative
controls, indicating presence of Ehrlichia chaffeensis IgG
antibodies. Follow the manufacturer’s specifications for cutoff
values.
16. IFA: Evaluate slides for the presence of specific fluorescence
patterns. Report results as positive if fluorescence consistent
with Ehrlichia chaffeensis IgG antibodies is observed.
17. Refer to site-specific reporting guidelines for result entry into
the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
18. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Negative: No detectable Ehrlichia chaffeensis IgG antibodies.
• Positive: Detectable Ehrlichia chaffeensis IgG antibodies. (Note:
Provide a semi-quantitative value where applicable, e.g., titer for
IFA.)
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
2. False positives may occur due to cross-reactivity with other
bacterial antibodies.
3. False negatives may occur if the patient is in the early stages of
infection.
4. ELISA: Interference from hemolysis, lipemia, or sample
contaminants may affect results.
