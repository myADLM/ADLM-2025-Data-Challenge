Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for ELASTASE, PANCREATIC, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized protocol for the analytical phase of
generating results for elastase, pancreatic, serum in a CLIA-certified
laboratory. This procedure ensures accurate and reliable test results
that meet quality standards.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel conducting elastase,
pancreatic, serum assays using specified instruments and following
approved methodologies.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all designated laboratory personnel to adhere
to this SOP for the analytical phase of elastase testing and to report
any inconsistencies or issues to the supervising technologist or
laboratory manager.
4. PROCEDURE
4.1. Specimen Requirements and Handling
• Specimen Type: Serum
• Collection: Blood should be collected in a red-top tube (no
anticoagulant) or serum separator tube (SST).
• Volume Required: Minimum 1.0 mL of serum.
• Stability: Serum should be separated from cells within 2 hours of
collection. Samples are stable for 7 days at 2-8°C and for up to 1
month when frozen at -20°C or below.
• Unacceptable Specimens: Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric
samples should be rejected. Samples should not be subjected to
repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
4.2. Equipment and Reagents
• Instrumentation: ELISA Reader calibrated for absorbance
reading at the relevant wavelength (e.g., 450 nm).
• Reagents: Commercially available elastase, pancreatic ELISA kit
(ensure reagents are stored as per manufacturer's instructions).
• Controls and Calibrators: High, low, and negative controls
specific to elastase, pancreatic, serum assays.
4.3. Testing Procedure
1. Preparation:
◦ Bring all reagents, samples, and controls to room
temperature (20-25°C) before starting the assay.
◦ Prepare any required working solutions according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
2. Assay Setup:
◦ Label microplate wells for standards, controls, and patient
samples.
◦ Add 50-100 µL of standards, controls, and serum samples
into the appropriate wells in duplicates.
◦ Follow the kit’s protocol for adding conjugate, washing
steps, and substrate addition. Ensure uniformity in the time
intervals between steps.
3. Incubation:
◦ Incubate the microplate according to the time and
temperature specified in the ELISA kit instructions.
◦ Maintain consistent incubation conditions to ensure the
reliability of results.
4. Reading Results:
◦ After the final incubation and stopping the reaction, read the
absorbance at 450 nm using the ELISA reader.
◦ Ensure that the ELISA reader is calibrated and previously
validated for performance.
4.4. Quality Control
• Internal QC:
◦ Run high, low, and negative controls with each batch of
samples tested.
◦ Review control results to ensure they fall within the specified
range provided by the manufacturer.
• Calibration Verification:
◦ Verify calibration curve through standards at the beginning of
each batch, ensuring the curve is linear and accurately
represents the concentration range.
4.5. Data Analysis and Reporting
• Data Analysis:
◦ Calculate the concentration of pancreatic elastase in patient
samples by interpreting the absorbance against the
established standard curve.
◦ Include appropriate dilution factors in final calculations, if
samples were diluted.
• Reporting Results:
◦ Report the final results in µg/mL or compatible units.
◦ Document any deviations from the protocol and the respective
corrective actions taken.
4.6. Method Limitations
Refer to the ELISA kit manufacturer’s insert for specific limitations
regarding cross-reactivity, interference, and other potential limitations
intrinsic to the specific assay utilized.
4.7. Documentation and Records
Ensure all data, including raw absorbance readings, calculated
concentrations, QC results, and any deviations or troubleshooting
steps, are documented and stored as per laboratory policy.
