Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analysis of IgE, Serum
by ELDER
1. PURPOSE
This procedure outlines the steps to analyze serum samples for
Immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels using the ELDER system. The goal is
to ensure accurate, precise, and reproducible measurements of
serum IgE to aid in the diagnosis and monitoring of allergic diseases.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all laboratory personnel to adhere to this
SOP. The designated laboratory staff will be responsible for
performing the analysis, quality control procedures, and the
maintenance of equipment as per manufacturer guidelines.
1. DEFINITIONS
ELDER: The specific analytical system/instrument used for IgE
quantification. IgE: Immunoglobulin E, an antibody involved in allergic
reactions.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen Type: Serum Collection: Venous blood collected in a
serum separator tube (SST). Stability:
• Refrigerated (2-8°C): 7 days
• Frozen (-20°C or lower): 1 month
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
ELDER analyzer Pipettes and pipette tips Quality control materials
(low, medium, high) Serum separator tubes (SST) IgE assay reagent
kit specific for the ELDER system Calibrators (traceable to
international standards) Disposable gloves
1. PROCEDURE
6.1 SAMPLE PREPARATION
1. Upon receipt, verify the sample details against laboratory
records to ensure correct identification.
2. If stored refrigerated or frozen, allow the sample to reach room
temperature and mix gently by inversion.
3. Centrifuge the SST at 1500 x g for 10 minutes to obtain serum.
6.2 CALIBRATION AND QUALITY CONTROL
1. Perform instrument calibration using the provided calibrators as
per the manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Run quality control materials at low, medium, and high levels
before analyzing patient samples. Ensure QC results fall within
acceptable ranges. Document all QC runs.
6.3 SAMPLE ANALYSIS
1. Prepare a worklist including all patient samples and controls.
2. Load the required number of reaction wells/cuvettes into the
ELDER analyzer.
3. Pipette the appropriate volume of serum sample, calibrators,
and controls into the respective wells/cuvettes.
4. Add the IgE assay reagents to each well/cuvette according to
the manufacturer’s protocol.
5. Initiate the assay run on the ELDER analyzer.
6. Carefully monitor the analysis for any error messages or
indications of malfunction.
6.4 REPORTING RESULTS
1. Once the run is completed, review the instrument-generated
data for any flags or errors.
2. Verify that control values are within acceptable ranges before
reporting patient results.
3. Enter verified results into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
4. QUALITY CONTROL
5. Perform quality control as described in section 6.2 with each
run of patient samples.
6. Investigate and document any QC failures. Do not report
patient results until the issue is resolved.
7. Conduct proficiency testing and participate in external quality
assurance programs as required.
8. MAINTENANCE
9. Regularly clean and maintain the ELDER analyzer following the
manufacturer’s instructions.
10. Record all maintenance activities in the instrument
maintenance log.
11. METHOD LIMITATIONS
12. Hemolysis, lipemia, or icterus in samples may interfere with
assay results.
13. Refer to the ELDER reagent kit insert for specific limitations
associated with the IgE assay.
