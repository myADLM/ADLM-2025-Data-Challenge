SOP Title: Analytical Protocol for Electrolyte and Osmolality Panel,
Feces
1. PURPOSE
To establish a consistent and accurate procedure for the
analysis and reporting of electrolyte and osmolality levels in
fecal samples.
Responsibility: The designated laboratory staff are responsible for
performing and documenting all aspects of the analytical phase of the
fecal electrolyte and osmolality panel. It is the supervisor's
responsibility to ensure that all staff adhere to this SOP.
1. DEFINITION
This procedure outlines the steps for the analysis of fecal
specimens for electrolyte (sodium, potassium, chloride) and
osmolality levels to ensure accurate and reliable results for
patient diagnosis and management.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
◦ Specimen Type: Fresh or frozen fecal samples
◦ Volume: Minimum of 5 grams
◦ Stability:
▪ Fresh fecal samples are stable for up to 24 hours when
refrigerated (2-8°C).
▪ Frozen fecal samples are stable for up to 72 hours. Avoid
repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
◦ Unacceptable Specimens:
▪ Samples mixed with urine or foreign material
▪ Samples that are not properly identified or labeled
3. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
◦ Analytical balances
◦ Centrifuge
◦ OsmoPrep osmometer
◦ Ion-selective electrode system for sodium, potassium,
chloride
◦ Deionized water
◦ Calibrators and controls specific for fecal electrolyte and
osmolality levels
◦ Standard laboratory consumables (e.g., pipettes, test tubes)
4. PROCEDURE A) Sample Preparation
1. Collect the required amount of fresh or frozen fecal
sample.
2. Thaw frozen samples at room temperature if necessary.
3. Homogenize the fecal sample thoroughly to ensure an
even mixture.
B) Analysis i) Electrolyte Measurement 1. Weigh approximately
1 gram of the homogenized fecal sample and transfer it to a
centrifuge tube. 2. Add 9 mL of deionized water to the fecal
sample (10% w/v ratio). 3. Mix the sample thoroughly and
centrifuge at 3000 RPM for 10 minutes. 4. Collect the
supernatant for analysis. 5. Using the ion-selective electrode
system, measure the concentrations of sodium, potassium, and
chloride in the supernatant. 6. Document the obtained values.
ii) Osmolality Measurement 1. Transfer a 1 mL aliquot of the
supernatant to a clean test tube. 2. Place the aliquot in the
OsmoPrep osmometer. 3. Follow the osmometer’s instructions
to measure the osmolality. 4. Document the obtained osmolality
value.
C) Quality Control
1. Analyze quality control samples (low, medium, high) with
each batch of patient samples.
2. Verify that control results fall within the acceptable range
before proceeding with patient sample analysis.
3. If controls fall outside of the acceptable range,
troubleshoot and resolve issues before retesting patient
samples.
D) Reporting Results
1. Enter electrolyte and osmolality results into the laboratory
information system (LIS).
2. Review and verify all results, ensuring they meet
acceptable quality standards.
3. Report verified results to the attending physician for
patient management.
E) Sample Retention
1. Retain sample aliquots at -20°C for any potential
reanalysis for up to 7 days after initial testing.
5. REFERENCE INTERVALS
◦ Sodium: 20-50 mmol/L
◦ Potassium: 10-40 mmol/L
◦ Chloride: 20-100 mmol/L
◦ Osmolality: 280-300 mOsm/kg
6. METHOD LIMITATIONS
◦ Accurate results depend on proper sample homogenization
and handling.
◦ Avoid cross-contamination between samples.
◦ Highly viscous or particulate-laden samples might require
additional preprocessing steps.

All laboratory personnel must be trained and competent in this SOP
before performing the procedure. Regular audits and quality
assessments should be conducted to ensure ongoing adherence to
this protocol.
