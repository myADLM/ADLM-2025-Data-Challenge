Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Electrolyte Panel, Blood
1. PURPOSE
This procedure is intended to provide instructions for the accurate
and reliable analysis and reporting of blood electrolyte panel results
in the clinical laboratory. The procedure aims to ensure consistent
analytical steps, maintain quality control, and deliver accurate patient
results.
Responsibility:
All trained laboratory personnel are responsible for following this
procedure precisely. Supervisors and senior laboratory staff are
responsible for ensuring adherence to this SOP, providing necessary
oversight, and taking corrective actions if required.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Preferred Specimen: - Arterial, venous, or capillary blood collected in
electrolyte-balanced heparin blood gas syringes. - Venous blood
collected in heparinized vacutainers (dark green or PST).
Acceptable Specimens: - Blood collected in SST (serum separator
tubes), if tubes are completely filled to maintain anaerobic conditions.
Unacceptable Specimens: - Sodium citrate, sodium fluoride/oxalate,
and EDTA specimens. - Specimens received in evacuated blood
collection tubes (e.g., Vacutainers or Microtainers). - Clotted
specimens. - Specimens with significant air bubbles (greater than
10% of specimen). - Specimen with needle attached.
Specimen Stability: - Blood gas syringe specimens should be
transported to the lab immediately by pneumatic tube or
transportation worker.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Analytical Instrument: - Blood gas analyzers (e.g., ABL90)
Quality Control Materials: - Three levels of quality control material,
automatically analyzed per manufacturer guidelines.
Supplies: - Blood collection syringes and tubes (heparinized). -
Quality control kits.
1. PROCEDURE
Sample Acceptance: - Verify the proper specimen type and integrity
as per the accepted criteria. - Inspect specimens for clots or air
bubbles; any unacceptable specimens must be rejected.
Sample Preparation: - Ensure proper mixing of heparinized blood
samples by rolling or using external magnet with metal flea. -
Centrifuge SST specimens if recommended, ensuring the specimen
is clot-free.
Analyzer Preparation: - Ensure the analyzer is properly calibrated
and quality control checks are up to date. - Load the patient sample
into the analyzer following the instrument-specific protocol.
Analysis: - Select the appropriate test panel on the analyzer
interface. - Run the sample through the scheduled analytical cycle. -
Monitor the analyzer for any error messages or alerts during the
process. - Record any discrepancies or issues in the instrument log.
Quality Control: - Perform intralab and internal quality control tests as
per the guidelines (e.g., bi-weekly, monthly comparisons). - If QC
fails, troubleshoot and re-run QC samples, or conduct patient sample
comparison if necessary.
Result Review and Verification: - Automatically transmit results to the
Laboratory Information System (LIS). - Technologist to review and
verify results. In case of questionable integrity, centrifuge an aliquot
or conduct other checks.
Critical Values Protocol: - Report critical values as per lab policy
including documentation and contacting the responsible clinician. -
Persistent critical values should be reanalyzed and, if confirmed,
documented and communicated.
Results Reporting: - For valid results, verify and report to LIS for
clinical use. - For questionable results (with error codes or significant
doubt), repeat analysis. If unresolved, report with “No Value” and
appropriate comments (e.g., "Analyte unavailable due to instrument
error").
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the instrument-specific user manual and reagent kit inserts
for limitations regarding accuracy, precision, and interferences of
individual analytes.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING
For any analytical error or problem with the analyzer: - Refer to the
analyzer's troubleshooting guidelines. - Consult senior laboratory
staff or on-call specialist if unresolved.

This SOP must be reviewed and updated annually or as needed to
maintain compliance with regulatory standards and laboratory
policies.
Documenting completion of the steps in this SOP should be done in
the appropriate laboratory logbooks and electronic record systems.
Ensure all relevant data including quality control, calibration, and
patient results are stored according to laboratory protocols.
