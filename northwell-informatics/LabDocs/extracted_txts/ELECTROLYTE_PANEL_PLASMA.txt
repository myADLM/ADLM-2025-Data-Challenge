Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Electrolyte Panel, Plasma
1. PURPOSE
To ensure accurate and reliable results for the determination of
electrolyte concentrations in plasma samples. This SOP details the
steps for the analysis, quality control, and reporting of results for the
electrolyte panel, including sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), chloride
(Cl-), and bicarbonate (HCO3-).
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the
analysis, quality control, and reporting of results as outlined in this
SOP. It is the responsibility of all staff to identify any deviations and
notify a supervisor.
2. DEFINITION
The Electrolyte Panel test measures the concentrations of essential
electrolytes in plasma, including:
• Sodium (Na+)
• Potassium (K+)
• Chloride (Cl-)
• Bicarbonate (HCO3-)
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Electrolyte analyzer equipment (e.g., ISE Analyzer)
• Calibrators and control materials
• Reagents for analyzer as specified by the manufacturer
• Plasma sample tubes (heparinized)
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
• Standard laboratory supplies (pipettes, tubes, etc.)
4. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation:
1. Ensure each plasma sample is collected in heparinized tubes
and is adequately labeled.
2. Centrifuge the samples at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes at room
temperature to obtain clear plasma. Avoid hemolysis.
3. Verify sample integrity. Do not use samples that appear
hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric.
B. Analyzer Preparation:
1. Turn on the electrolyte analyzer and allow it to perform a self-
test and warm-up as per manufacturer instructions.
2. Ensure all reagents, calibrators, and controls are loaded
correctly.
3. Perform calibration of the analyzer using manufacturer-provided
calibrators. Record calibration results in the calibration log.
C. Quality Control:
1. Run quality control (QC) samples before patient samples,
including at least two levels of controls (normal and abnormal).
2. Verify that QC results are within the accepted ranges. If QC
results are out of range, troubleshoot and repeat QC until
acceptable results are obtained.
3. Document QC results in the QC log.
D. Sample Analysis:
1. Load the plasma samples onto the analyzer following the
manufacturer's instructions.
2. Select the appropriate assay for the electrolyte panel.
3. Run the samples and monitor the analyzer for any error
messages or alerts.
4. Document any actions taken in case of errors or alerts.
E. Result Validation:
1. Review the analyzer printouts or digital records for each
sample.
2. Validate that results are consistent with control ranges and do
not show signs of instrument malfunction.
3. Evaluate any flagged results according to established criteria
and repeat testing if necessary.
F. Reporting Results:
1. Enter validated results into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
2. Review and verify results in the LIS, ensuring that any critical
values are flagged for immediate reporting to the clinician.
3. Report results following site-specific guidelines for
documentation and communication of critical values.
5. QUALITY CONTROL AND MAINTENANCE
A. Routine Maintenance:
1. Perform daily, weekly, and monthly maintenance on the
electrolyte analyzer as specified by the manufacturer.
2. Record all maintenance activities in the maintenance log.
B. Analyzer Calibration:
1. Perform calibration after reagent replacement, maintenance, or
whenever QC results indicate a need.
2. Document all calibration activities and results in the calibration
log.
C. Documentation and Record Keeping:
1. Maintain logs for sample processing, QC results, calibration
records, and maintenance activities.
2. Ensure records are accurate and readily available for review by
supervisors or regulatory bodies.
6. METHOD LIMITATIONS
1. Interferences such as hemolysis, lipemia, or icterus can affect
the results. Ensure samples are free of such interferences.
2. Follow specific limitations noted in the analyzer's operator
manual.
7. REFERENCES
1. Manufacturer's Manual for the Electrolyte Analyzer.
2. Laboratory Policies and Procedures.
3. Relevant Quality Control Guidelines.
8. TROUBLESHOOTING
1. If QC results are out of range, perform troubleshooting as per
the manufacturer's recommendations.
2. Contact the technical support of the analyzer's manufacturer for
unresolved issues.
3. Document all troubleshooting steps and resolutions in the
troubleshooting log.
9. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS
1. Follow laboratory safety guidelines at all times.
2. Use PPE when handling samples and reagents.
3. Dispose of waste materials according to laboratory biohazard
protocols.
10. DOCUMENT CONTROL
1. This SOP must be reviewed annually and updated as
necessary to ensure compliance with current standards and
practices.
2. The laboratory manager or designee is responsible for ensuring
updates are completed and communicated to all relevant
personnel.
By following this SOP, laboratory staff can ensure the accuracy and
reliability of electrolyte panel results, thereby supporting quality
patient care.
