Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Electrolyte Panel,
Serum
1. Purpose
To provide a standardized protocol for the analysis and reporting of
serum electrolyte levels, ensuring accurate and reliable results for
patient care.
2. Scope
This procedure applies to trained personnel in the clinical laboratory
responsible for the analysis of serum electrolyte panels including
sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), chloride (Cl-), and bicarbonate
(HCO3-).
3. Responsibility
All designated laboratory personnel are responsible for following this
SOP for the analytical process. Supervisors must ensure compliance
and address any deviations from this protocol.
4. Definition
Serum Electrolytes: Na+, K+, Cl-, and HCO3- measured to assess
and monitor the fluid and electrolyte balance in patients.
5. Specimen Requirements
• Specimen Type: Serum
• Container: Serum separator tube (SST) or plain red-top tube
• Volume: Minimum of 1 mL serum
• Stability: Serum should be separated from cells within 2 hours of
collection and can be stored at 2-8°C up to 48 hours. For longer
storage, serum should be frozen at -20°C.
6. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies
• Automated chemistry analyzer (e.g., Roche Cobas, Beckman
Coulter AU)
• Calibrators and control materials specific to the instrument
• Electrolyte reagents provided by the manufacturer
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
• Pipettes and tips
• Specimen tubes and racks
7. Procedure
Calibration and Quality Control:
1. Prepare and load calibrators according to manufacturer
instructions.
2. Perform daily and pre-run quality control using control
samples (low, normal, high). Ensure results are within
acceptable ranges.
3. Document all calibrations and quality control results in the QC
log.
Sample Preparation:
1. Centrifuge samples at 1500-2000g for 10 minutes to separate
serum.
2. Transfer serum to a secondary tube if needed.
3. Inspect serum for hemolysis or other contaminants. Note any
sample integrity issues.
Sample Analysis:
1. Load samples onto the automated chemistry analyzer.
2. Select the appropriate test panel for electrolytes.
3. Running the test:
◦ Follow the instrument's operating procedures for starting the
analysis.
◦ Monitor the analyzer throughout the run for flags or errors.
◦ Ensure the analyzer's temperature and reagent levels are
adequate.
Result Verification:
1. Review generated results for each sample. Check for flags,
errors, or out-of-range values.
2. Verify and validate results according to laboratory protocols.
Repeat analysis if necessary for flagged or out-of-range results.
3. Use the Mnemonics or smart phrases for reporting critical or
problematic results.
Reporting Results:
1. Transmit validated results to the Laboratory Information
System (LIS) for final review.
2. Ensure results are reviewed by a qualified technologist
before release.
3. Document critical results and notify physician as per critical
value policy.
8. Method Limitations
• Hemolysis can affect K+ levels. Do not report results from
hemolyzed specimens without notation.
• Lipemic samples may interfere with some analyzers. Follow
instrument-specific guidelines for handling lipemic samples.
• Ensure consistent specimen handling to avoid introducing pre-
analytical variability.

• Manufacturer reagent inserts and quality control guidelines
• Laboratory sample handling and quality assurance protocols
10. Quality Assurance
Regularly schedule maintenance and performance checks for
analyzers according to the manufacturer's guidelines. Review and
update SOP annually or as needed to incorporate new procedures or
improve existing ones.
11. Record Keeping
Maintain logs for calibrations, quality control, instrument
maintenance, sample analysis, and result verification. Ensure
documentation is complete and accessible for audits and reviews.
12. Appendices
Include detailed steps for instrument calibration, troubleshooting
guide, critical value policy, and example reporting formats. Provide
contact information for the on-call supervisor for emergencies or
unexpected issues.
