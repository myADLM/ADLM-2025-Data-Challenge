Standard Operating Procedure for Electron Microscopy Analysis
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the standardized procedure for
conducting electron microscopy analysis in the laboratory, ensuring
the accuracy and reliability of microscopic observations and data
generation.
Responsibility:
• Trained laboratory personnel are responsible for preparing
samples, operating the electron microscope, recording data, and
performing initial data analysis as outlined in this procedure.
• It is the responsibility of the laboratory supervisor to ensure
adherence to this protocol and oversee any troubleshooting
measures required during the analysis.
2. DEFINITION
Electron Microscopy Analysis refers to the examination and imaging
of samples at high magnification and resolution using an electron
microscope. The specific type of electron microscopy may vary (e.g.
Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) or Scanning Electron
Microscopy (SEM)).
3. PROCEDURE
A) Sample Preparation:
1. Fixation:
◦ Fix samples in an appropriate fixative, such as 2.5%
glutaraldehyde for TEM or 2% osmium tetroxide for SEM.
◦ Properly store fixed samples until embedding or further
preparation.
2. Dehydration:
◦ Dehydrate samples through a graded series of ethanol or
acetone solutions (e.g., 50%, 70%, 90%, 100%).
3. Embedding (TEM samples only):
◦ Infiltrate samples with epoxy resin or another suitable
embedding medium.
◦ Polymerize the resin according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
4. Sectioning (TEM samples only):
◦ Use an ultramicrotome to section embedded samples to a
desired thickness (typically 60-90 nm).
◦ Collect sections on copper grids or other appropriate
supports.
5. Drying and Coating (SEM samples only):
◦ Dry samples using a critical point dryer or other suitable
method.
◦ Sputter coat samples with a conductive material (e.g., gold,
platinum) as required.
B) Instrument Operation:
1. Startup Procedure:
◦ Ensure the electron microscope is turned on and adequately
warmed up according to the manufacturer's instructions.
◦ Verify that all necessary maintenance checks have been
performed prior to use.
2. Loading Samples:
◦ Carefully load the prepared sample into the sample holder
or stage.
◦ Ensure proper alignment and secure placement to avoid
damage during observation.
3. Imaging:
◦ Adjust the electron beam parameters (e.g., accelerating
voltage) based on the type of sample and analysis
requirements.
◦ Optimize the focus, magnification, and contrast settings to
obtain clear images.
◦ Conduct preliminary scans to identify areas of interest.
◦ Capture high-resolution images and micrographs at multiple
magnifications as needed.
C) Data Recording and Analysis:
1. Image Acquisition:
◦ Save images and micrographs to a secure data storage
system with appropriate labeling for sample identification.
◦ Document imaging parameters and conditions for each set
of images.
2. Data Analysis:
◦ Use appropriate image analysis software to conduct
quantitative or qualitative analysis.
◦ Annotate and interpret the microscopic findings as required
for the study or project.
D) Quality Control and Maintenance:
1. Quality Control Checks:
◦ Conduct regular calibration and performance verification
according to the manufacturer’s guidelines.
◦ Document the quality control results in the logbook.
2. Maintenance:
◦ Perform routine maintenance and cleaning procedures as
recommended by the equipment manufacturers.
◦ Record all maintenance activities in the equipment logbook.
4. Reporting Results:
• Compile the analyzed data and images into a report.
• Review and verify all results with a qualified supervisor.
• Follow site-specific guidelines for reporting and documentation.
5. Safety Considerations:
• Adhere to laboratory safety protocols when handling chemicals
and biological specimens.
• Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) when
preparing samples and operating the electron microscope.
• Follow proper protocols for disposal of biohazardous and
chemical waste.
6. References:
• Manufacturer's manuals for electron microscopes.
• Relevant scientific literature and protocols for electron microscopy
sample preparation and analysis.
This SOP ensures standardized practices for electron microscopy
analysis, supporting the accuracy and consistency of microscopic
observations and data generation in the laboratory.
