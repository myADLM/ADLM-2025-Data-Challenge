Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for the
Analytical Phase: ELM, IGE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
This protocol outlines the procedures for the analytical phase of
generating results for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELM),
Immunoglobulin E (IgE), and other serum-based testing. Ensuring
accurate, timely, and quality results is integral to the diagnostic
process.
RESPONSIBILITY
• Designated Laboratory Technicians: Conduct and document all
testing procedures.
• Supervisors: Ensure compliance with protocols, address any
deficiencies, and provide necessary oversight.
• Quality Control Personnel: Verify the calibration, validation, and
quality control processes.
2. DEFINITION
• ELM: Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay used for detecting
and quantifying soluble substances like proteins, peptides,
antibodies, and hormones.
• IgE: Immunoglobulin E testing, crucial for diagnosing allergic
reactions and assessing immune response.
• Serum: The component of blood used for various biochemical,
immunological, and serological tests.
3. PROCEDURE
A) Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies:
• Equipment:
◦ ELISA reader
◦ Calibrated pipettes
◦ Incubators, Centrifuge
◦ Micropipettes
◦ Refrigerators and Freezers
• Reagents:
◦ Specific ELISA kits for ELM
◦ Standard solutions for IgE
◦ Calibrators and control sera
◦ Washing buffer, Substrate solution
• Supplies:
◦ Microtitre plates
◦ Serum collection tubes (preferably SST)
◦ Disposable pipette tips, Gloves
B) Specimen Requirements and Stability:
• Specimen Type: Serum
• Volume Needed: 5-10 mL
• Collection: Ensure proper collection using SST tubes, allow to
clot and then centrifuge to separate serum.
• Stability:
◦ Stable at 2-8°C for up to 48 hours.
◦ For longer storage, freeze at -20°C or lower.
C) Calibration and Quality Control:
• Calibration:
◦ Calibrate the ELISA reader and pipettes before each assay
using manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Ensure that all reagents are within their expiry date and stored
appropriately.
• Quality Control:
◦ Use of internal and external controls to validate assay results.
◦ Document control results and take corrective action if controls
fall outside the acceptable range.
D) Analytical Procedure:
1. Preparation:
◦ Thaw samples, controls, and reagents to room temperature.
◦ Mix gently to ensure homogeneity.
2. Assay Setup:
◦ Follow the manufacturer’s instructions provided in the kit
insert for step-by-step guidance.
◦ Pipette the required volume of standards, controls, and
samples into the designated wells of the microtitre plate.
3. Incubation:
◦ Incubate the plate for the specified duration at the
recommended temperature.
◦ Use covers or sealers to prevent evaporation.
4. Washing:
◦ Wash the plates thoroughly using the wash buffer to remove
unbound substances.
◦ Ensure no residual liquid is left behind to avoid cross-
contamination.
5. Detection:
◦ Add substrate solution and incubate according to the
protocol.
◦ Measure the absorbance at the specified wavelength using
an ELISA reader.
6. Calculation:
◦ Calculate the concentration of analytes in the samples using
a standard curve generated from the assay.
◦ Validate the results by ensuring they are within the expected
range of control values.
E) Reporting Results:
• Document results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Review and verify results before releasing to clinicians.
• Report any critical values according to the laboratory’s protocol for
critical results handling.
F) Troubleshooting and Maintenance:
• Document any issues, discrepancies, or deviations from the SOP,
and inform the supervisor immediately.
• Maintain a log of all equipment checks, calibrations, and
maintenance performed.
• If assay results are not as expected, repeat the assay and check
all procedural steps.
Additionally, regular participation in proficiency testing programs and
continuous education on new developments in ELISA and serological
technologies is recommended for all laboratory personnel.
