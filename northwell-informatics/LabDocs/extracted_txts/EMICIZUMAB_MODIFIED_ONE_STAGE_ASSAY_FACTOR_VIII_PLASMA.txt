Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for EMICIZUMAB, Modified
One Stage Assay Factor VIII, Plasma
1. PURPOSE This SOP outlines the analytical procedure for
generating results for Emicizumab, Modified One Stage Assay
Factor VIII in plasma. Emicizumab is used to treat patients with
Hemophilia A, and the modified assay accurately measures
Factor VIII activity in the presence of Emicizumab.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory staff are responsible for
performing the assay following the procedures outlined in this SOP. It
is the responsibility of all staff to ensure the accuracy and reliability of
the test results and to address any issues or concerns to a
supervisor.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Requirements: - Type: Plasma, collected in sodium
citrate tubes. - Volume: Minimum 1 mL. - Stability: Stable for up to 4
hours at room temperature. If not processed within 4 hours, store at
−20°C and thaw once for testing. - Unacceptable Specimens:
Hemolyzed, lipemic, or improperly labeled specimens.
B. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies: - Coagulation Analyzer. -
Modified One Stage Assay Kits for Factor VIII. - Emicizumab-specific
calibrators and controls. - 20 mM Calcium chloride solution. -
Reference plasma. - Pipettes and plasma cups.
C. Pre-Analytical Considerations: - Confirm specimen suitability. -
Thaw frozen specimens in a 37°C water bath.
D. Analytical Procedure: 1. Calibration and Quality Control: - Perform
calibration using Emicizumab-specific calibrators according to
manufacturer's guidelines. - Run quality control using Emicizumab-
specific controls at low, medium, and high levels. Ensure control
results fall within acceptable limits before proceeding with patient
samples.
2. Preparing the Assay:
- Warm reagents and plasma samples to room temperature before use.
- Mix reagents gently to avoid frothing or bubbles.
3. Assay Steps:
a. Pipette 50 μL of the plasma sample into a plasma cup.
b. Add 50 μL of the provided assay reagent to the plasma and mix thoroughly.
c. Activate with 100 μL calcium chloride solution.
d. Incubate at 37°C for specified time as per kit insert.
e. Measure clotting time using the coagulation analyzer.
4. Calculating Factor VIII Activity:
- Input clotting times into the software.
- Factor VIII activity levels will be calculated automatically based on the standard curve generated during calibration.
E. Post-Analytical Considerations: - Review results for accuracy and
consistency. Any unusual results should be re-assayed. - Document
results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS) and ensure data
transfer to Electronic Medical Records (EMR). - Report any critical
values immediately as per lab policy.
F. Troubleshooting: - If the assay fails to produce valid results,
perform the following checks: i. Verify calibration status. ii. Ensure
quality control results are within acceptable limits. iii. Confirm reagent
and specimen integrity. iv. Re-assay the sample if necessary.
1. MAINTENANCE AND RECORD KEEPING
A. Equipment: - Regularly inspect and maintain the coagulation
analyzer following manufacturer's instructions. - Document all
maintenance activities.
B. Temperature Monitoring: - Ensure all reagents and specimens are
stored at proper temperatures.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
A. Monitoring: - Verify all controls and run at least once per shift. -
Maintain records of all control results for review.
1. REFERENCES Refer to the manufacturer's protocol for the
Emicizumab-specific Modified One Stage Assay Factor VIII kit
insert for detailed reagent handling and assay procedures.
By adhering to these steps, laboratory staff will ensure accurate and
reliable results for Emicizumab, Modified One Stage Assay Factor
VIII in plasma.
