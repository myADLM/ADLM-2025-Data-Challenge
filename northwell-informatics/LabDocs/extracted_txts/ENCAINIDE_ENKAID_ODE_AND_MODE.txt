Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for ENCAINIDE (ENKAID)
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the procedures for the analytical phase of
generating results for Encainide (Encainide Hydrochloride, ENKAID),
including establishing proper guidelines for specimen handling,
analysis, quality control, and reporting.
Responsibility:
All trained laboratory staff members and supervisors are responsible
for the accurate execution of the procedures outlined in this SOP to
ensure reliable and reproducible results.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred Specimens:
• 5 mL of serum or plasma collected in a red-top tube or lithium
heparin tube.
• Ensure that serum or plasma is separated from cells within 2
hours of collection.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples due to potential
interference with assay results.
• Specimens with visible particulate matter.
• Samples collected in EDTA or sodium citrate tubes.
Specimen Stability:
• Serum or plasma should be kept at 2-8°C and analyzed within 7
days of collection.
• If analysis cannot be conducted within 7 days, specimens must be
frozen at -20°C and are stable for up to 3 months.
1. REAGENTS, SUPPLIES, AND EQUIPMENT
Reagents:
• Encainide (ENKAID) assay kit, including calibrators and controls.
• Quality control materials at both high and low levels.
Supplies:
• Recommended pipettes and disposable tips.
• Vortex mixer.
• Centrifuge.
• Analytic balance.
Equipment:
• High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) System or an
equivalent instrument.
• Calibrated analytical balance.
• Laboratory refrigerator and freezer for sample storage.
• Laboratory temperature and humidity monitor system.
1. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation:
1. Inspect all reagents and supplies for expiry dates and integrity
before use.
2. Bring all reagents, controls, and specimens to room
temperature (20-25°C) before starting the assay.
B) Calibration:
1. Perform HPLC system calibration using the manufacturer's
guidelines.
2. Use encainide calibration standards to generate a calibration
curve for quantification purposes.
3. Ensure that the calibration curve meets the acceptance criteria
with an R-squared value (R²) > 0.99.
C) Sample Preparation:
1. Allow serum or plasma samples to reach room temperature.
2. Vortex the sample for 30 seconds to ensure homogeneity.
3. Centrifuge specimens at 3000 RPM for 10 minutes at 4°C.
4. Aliquot 100 µL of the supernatant for analysis.
D) Analysis:
1. Set HPLC parameters as specified in the manufacturer’s
instructions.
2. Load samples, calibrators, and controls in a defined sequence
into the HPLC system.
3. Initiate the run and monitor the system to ensure no disruption
occurs during the analysis.
E) Quality Control:
1. Run quality control materials at both high and low levels with
each batch of samples.
2. Use quality control results to verify the accuracy and precision
of the assay.
3. If QC results are out of acceptable limits, troubleshoot and
repeat the analysis before reporting patient results.
4. REPORTING RESULTS
5. Verify the results from the HPLC system, ensuring they meet
acceptance criteria.
6. Document raw data and calculations used for result
determination.
7. Report results in ng/mL with appropriate patient identification
details and any relevant comments on the LIS (Laboratory
Information System).
8. Critical values should be rechecked and verified before
reporting to the physician; if outside the reference range, follow
the repeat testing guidelines.
9. DOCUMENTATION
Ensure that all records, including the calibration curves, QC results,
specimen info, and trouble-shooting logs, are maintained for
traceability and audit purposes.
