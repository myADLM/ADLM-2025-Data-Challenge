Standard Operating Procedure
Encephalopathy, Autoimmune/Paraneoplastic Evaluation, Serum
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedure for the analytical
phase of generating results for encephalopathy, autoimmune/
paraneoplastic evaluation using serum specimens. This protocol
ensures that all specimens are processed accurately and timely to
provide reliable diagnostic results.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred/Acceptable Specimen:
◦ Serum collected in a plain red-top tube or serum separator
tube (SST).
◦ Volume: Minimum 1 mL of serum.
• Unacceptable Specimen:
◦ Specimens that are hemolyzed, contaminated, or mislabeled.
◦ Specimens arriving without the required collection date/time
indicated on the sample container or requisition form.
◦ Frozen specimens (unless specified).
3. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Centrifuge capable of separating serum from whole blood.
• Refrigerated storage (2-8°C).
• Serum pipettes.
• Autoanalyzer or ELISA reader.
• Assay-specific kits for autoimmune/paraneoplastic
encephalopathy evaluation (consult the manufacturer's package
insert for detailed reagent requirements).
4. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation and Separation of Serum:
1. Ensure the serum specimens meet the acceptable criteria upon
arrival.
2. Centrifuge the whole blood specimens at 3000 RPM for 10-15
minutes to separate the serum.
3. Carefully pipette the serum into a properly labeled secondary
container.
4. Store the serum at 2-8°C until analysis.
B. Assay Setup:
1. Follow the manufacturer's instructions provided with the specific
assay kits for autoimmune/paraneoplastic encephalopathy
evaluation.
2. Set up the autoanalyzer or ELISA reader according to the kit
instructions and laboratory guidelines.
3. Verify that the instrumentation calibration is current and
acceptable.
C. Analysis:
1. Pipette the appropriate volume of serum (as specified by the
assay kit) into wells or tubes based on the assay design.
2. Add specific reagents/controls to each well/tube according to
the kit protocol.
3. Allow the reaction/incubation phases as recommended by the
manufacturer.
4. Read the results on the instrument (autoanalyzer/ELISA reader)
according to the kit guidelines.
D. Quality Control:
1. Run internal quality control materials (both positive and
negative controls) with each batch of samples.
2. Ensure the controls fall within the established acceptable
ranges before accepting the specimen results.
3. Document the control results in the designated log.
E. Data Reporting and Validation:
1. Validate results based on control performance, instrument
calibration, and assay specifics.
2. Review raw data carefully to ensure there are no anomalies or
unexpected results.
3. Trasmit final validated results to the LIS (Laboratory Information
System).
4. Verify and release results following laboratory-specific reporting
guidelines.
5. Documentation should include the date, time, technologist
initials, and any comments or discrepancies noted during the
analysis.
5. REFERENCE INTERVALS AND INTERPRETATION:
Consult assay-specific reference intervals given in the manufacturer's
insert for autoimmune/paraneoplastic encephalopathy evaluation.
Interpretation of results should be done by a clinical pathologist in
context with clinical findings and other laboratory results.
6. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
Refer to the assay kit insert for limitations specific to the reagent
pads or analytes in the autoimmune/paraneoplastic encephalopathy
evaluation.
7. REFERENCES:
Assay-specific manufacturer inserts are the primary reference
documents for procedural guidelines.
