SOP Title: Analytical Protocol for Autoimmune/
Paraneoplastic Encephalopathy Evaluation in Spinal
Fluid
1. PURPOSE
To outline the standardized procedure for the analysis of spinal fluid
specimens for autoimmune/paraneoplastic encephalopathy
evaluation, ensuring consistent and accurate results.
2. DEFINITION
Autoimmune/paraneoplastic encephalopathy evaluation includes
testing for autoimmune antibodies, paraneoplastic neural antibodies,
and any other relevant markers in spinal fluid.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of designated laboratory staff to follow this
protocol to ensure accurate and reliable testing. Supervisors are
responsible for reviewing and verifying results.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred Specimen:
• Spinal Fluid (CSF): 0.5-1 mL collected in sterile tubes without
preservatives.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens in containers with preservatives (e.g., sodium citrate,
sodium fluoride/oxalate, EDTA).
• Specimens contaminated by blood.
• Specimens older than 48 hours if not stored at 2-8°C immediately
after collection.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Centrifuge suitable for CSF samples.
• Refrigerated storage units.
• Autoimmune/Paraneoplastic panel-specific ELISA kits and/or
western blot kits.
• Plate readers.
• Pipettes and tips.
Reagents:
• ELISA kit reagents for specific antibodies.
• Western Blot reagents.
• Blocking solution.
• Secondary antibody conjugate.
• Substrate solution for colorimetric detection.
Supplies:
• Sterile pipette tips.
• Microplates.
• Tubes and caps.
• Gloves.
• PPE.
6. PROCEDURE
A) Specimen Handling:
1. Verify specimen label for correct patient identification and
collection date/time.
2. Centrifuge CSF specimens at 1000g for 10 minutes to remove
cells.
3. Aliquot supernatant into labeled tubes for analysis and storage.
B) ELISA Testing:
1. Warm reagents and samples to room temperature before use.
2. Set up ELISA plate as per manufacturer's instructions.
3. Add 100 μL of CSF to designated wells.
4. Incubate the plate at room temperature for specified time.
5. Wash plate as instructed.
6. Add appropriate antibodies and substrate solutions.
7. Incubate for color development.
8. Read the optical density (OD) at given wavelength using a plate
reader.
9. Compare ODs against standard curve for quantitative results.
C) Western Blot Analysis:
1. Run CSF sample through SDS-PAGE.
2. Transfer proteins to a membrane.
3. Block the membrane using blocking solution.
4. Incubate membrane with primary antibodies specific to the
autoimmune/paraneoplastic markers.
5. Wash membrane.
6. Incubate with secondary conjugated antibodies.
7. Develop bands using substrate solution.
8. Compare band sizes and intensities with controls for qualitative
results.
D) Interpretation of Results:
1. Analyze ELISA and Western Blot results against controls.
2. Positive identifications should be cross-checked with patient
clinical data.
3. Document findings meticulously in LIS.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform a QC check using known positive and negative control
samples with every batch.
• Log QC data including date, time, and result.
• Any deviations should be investigated, and corrective actions
must be taken before sample testing.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results are automatically transmitted to LIS and reviewed by the
technologist.
• Confirm measurement integrity before verification.
• If critical or unexpected results are found, notify the attending
physician directly.
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the specific ELISA and Western Blot kit inserts for detailed
limitations on sensitivity, specificity, and any interfering substances.
10. REFERENCES
Include references to kit inserts, manufacturer protocols, and relevant
clinical guidelines.
By adhering strictly to this SOP, laboratory staff will ensure accuracy
and reliability in the evaluation of autoimmune/paraneoplastic
encephalopathy in spinal fluid specimens.
