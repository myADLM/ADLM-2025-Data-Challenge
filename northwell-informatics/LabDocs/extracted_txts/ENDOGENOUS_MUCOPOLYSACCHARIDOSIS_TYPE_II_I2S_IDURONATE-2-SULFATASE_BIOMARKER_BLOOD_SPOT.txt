Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Endogenous Mucopolysaccharidosis
Type II (I2S [Iduronate-2-Sulfatase]) Biomarker, Blood Spot
1. PURPOSE
This SOP delineates the steps involved in the analytical phase of
generating results for the I2S (Iduronate-2-Sulfatase) biomarker from
blood spot specimens to ensure accurate, reliable, and timely results
for diagnosing Mucopolysaccharidosis Type II (Hunter syndrome).
2. SCOPE
This procedure is applicable to the Biochemistry Laboratory
personnel responsible for processing, analyzing, and reporting I2S
biomarker results from blood spot samples.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Laboratory technicians are responsible for performing the assay
according to this SOP.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring compliance with this
SOP and addressing any issues arising during the procedure.
4. DEFINITION
I2S Biomarker: Iduronate-2-sulfatase is an enzyme used as a
biomarker for diagnosing Mucopolysaccharidosis Type II (Hunter
syndrome).
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
A) Acceptable:
• Blood spots collected on standardized filter paper cards (dried
blood spots).
• Specimens should be allowed to air dry for at least 4 hours before
transportation.
• Filters cards must be stored at room temperature and analyzed
within 7 days of collection.
B) Unacceptable:
• Blood spots that are smeared, insufficiently filled (less than 70%
saturation), or not thoroughly dried.
• Specimens with contamination, hemolysis, or arriving beyond 7
days post-collection.
6. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Standardized filter paper cards for blood spot collection
• Micro-punch or cutting tool for blood spots
• Extraction reagents and buffer (as per kit instructions)
• Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit for I2S
• Incubator and shaker
• Microplate reader compatible with the ELISA kit
• Calibrated pipettes and tips
7. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation:
1. Inspect each blood spot specimen for quality and verify
completeness of the requisition form.
2. Record any specimen rejections with rationale in the log.
B) Extraction of I2S from Blood Spot:
1. Punch out a 3.2 mm disk from each dried blood spot sample
using a clean micro-punch tool.
2. Place the punched disks into a labeled microtube or well of a
96-well plate as required.
3. Add the specific volume of extraction buffer (as per kit protocol)
to each well or tube.
4. Incubate the samples in the shaker incubator at 37°C for 1 hour
to solubilize the I2S enzyme.
C) ELISA Assay:
1. Prepare the ELISA plate according to the manufacturer's
instructions included in the ELISA kit.
2. Transfer the extracted enzyme solution from each sample well/
tube to the corresponding well of the ELISA plate.
3. Follow the ELISA protocol for the addition of standards,
controls, substrates, and any washing procedures.
4. Incubate the plate as directed in the kit instructions.
5. Measure the optical density (OD) of each well using a
microplate reader set at the appropriate wavelength (typically
450 nm).
D) Data Analysis and Results Interpretation:
1. Generate a standard curve using the OD values obtained from
the standards provided in the ELISA kit.
2. Determine the I2S concentration in each sample by
interpolation from the standard curve.
3. Ensure all controls fall within the acceptable range. Re-perform
the assay if controls are out of range.
8. QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE
• Control Samples: Run positive and negative controls with every
batch of specimens to ensure accuracy.
• Calibration: Ensure all equipment, including microplate reader and
pipettes, are calibrated and functioning correctly.
• Documentation: Record all results, deviations, and corrective
actions in the laboratory information system (LIS).
• Cross-Check: Have a second qualified technologist review and
verify the results for accuracy before reporting.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
• Enter the results into the LIS for validation.
• Notify the clinical team promptly of any critical or significantly
abnormal results as per laboratory policy.
• Provide interpretation and comment on the results (e.g., “I2S
activity below reference range suggestive of
Mucopolysaccharidosis Type II”).
