Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Endogenous Mucopolysaccharidosis
Type II (I2S [Iduronate-2-Sulfatase]) Biomarker Reflex, Blood
Spot
1. PURPOSE
To describe the procedures for the analysis and reporting of
Iduronate-2-Sulfatase (I2S) biomarker from blood spot specimens for
the identification of Mucopolysaccharidosis Type II (MPS II).
1. RESPONSIBILITY
• Designated laboratory technologists perform all analytical testing
and documentation.
• Supervisors ensure adherence to this protocol, including training
and quality control compliance.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
3.1 Specimen Type:
• Blood Spot
3.2 Specimen Collection:
• Collected on appropriate filter paper (DBS – Dried Blood Spot
card)
• Allow blood spots to air dry thoroughly for at least 3 hours at room
temperature.
• Ensure correct labeling with patient identification, date, and time
of collection.
3.3 Specimen Handling and Storage:
• Store dried blood spots at 4-25°C in a dry, dark place.
• Specimens must arrive at the laboratory within 2 weeks of
collection.
• Avoid exposure to high temperatures, humidity, and direct
sunlight.
3.4 Unacceptable Specimens:
• Clotted, hemolyzed, or improperly collected specimens.
• Specimens arriving in the laboratory more than 2 weeks after
collection.
• Blood spots that are not thoroughly dried, insufficient in volume, or
contaminated.
1. EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS
• Puncher device for extracting dried blood spots.
• Extraction solvents and buffer solutions.
• Assay kits specific for Iduronate-2-Sulfatase (I2S) analysis.
• Quality control materials, including positive and negative controls.
• Analytical instruments, such as tandem mass spectrometry (MS/
MS) or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) platform.
• Calibrators and reagents as specified in the assay kit inserts.
• Protective equipment and laboratory supplies (e.g., pipettes,
gloves, containers).
1. PROCEDURE
5.1 Preparation:
1. Calibrate and validate all equipment and instruments as per the
manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Ensure all reagents and quality control materials are within
expiry dates.
5.2 Blood Spot Extraction:
1. Using a puncher, extract a specified diameter punch (e.g., 3.2
mm) from the dried blood spot card.
2. Place the punched spot into a designated microfuge tube.
3. Add the extraction buffer and incubate as per the kit
instructions. Vortex and centrifuge the tube as required to
ensure thorough extraction of the biomarker.
5.3 Assay Procedure:
1. Follow the respective assay kit procedure for Iduronate-2-
Sulfatase analysis:
◦ For MS/MS Analysis:
1. Prepare samples, standards, and quality controls
according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
2. Set up and program the MS/MS system according to
specific assay parameters.
3. Analyze the samples, with appropriate blanks and
controls.
◦ For ELISA:
1. Follow the step-by-step procedure for sample,
calibrator, and control preparation.
2. Dispense reagents into wells, incubate, and wash as
directed.
3. Measure optical density using a microplate reader set
to the specified wavelength.
5.4 Data Analysis:
1. Using the instrument-specific software, calculate the
concentration of I2S in the blood spot samples compared to the
calibrators.
2. Ensure the quality control results fall within the acceptable
ranges before releasing patient results.
3. Document any deviations from protocol and corrective actions
taken.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
6.1 Internal Quality Control:
• Run quality controls (positive and negative) with each batch of
specimens.
• Document control results and verify they meet predefined criteria.
6.2 External Quality Control:
• Participate in external proficiency testing programs where
available.
• Maintain records of proficiency testing outcomes and implement
corrective action for any discrepancies.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results are automatically or manually entered into the Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
• Technologists review results for accuracy and compliance with
internal control standards.
• Report findings to referring physician or healthcare provider with
standardized comments where applicable.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Reference intervals will be provided based on assay-specific data
and validated for clinical use.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Avoid interpreting results if quality controls fail.
• Refer to the assay kit insert for specific limitations related to the
analytical method.
