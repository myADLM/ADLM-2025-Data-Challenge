STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP) Title: Analytical
Phase of Generating Results for Endogenous Mucopolysaccharidosis
Type I (IDUA [Alpha-L-iduronidase]) Biomarker, Blood Spot
1. PURPOSE To outline the procedure for the analytical phase in the
generation of results for Endogenous Mucopolysaccharidosis Type I
(IDUA [Alpha-L-iduronidase]) biomarker from blood spot specimens.
This protocol ensures accuracy and reliability of results reporting in
compliance with CLIA-certified laboratory standards.
2. RESPONSIBILITY It is the responsibility of all trained laboratory
personnel to perform this procedure accurately. The supervising
technologist is responsible for reviewing and verifying all results.
3. SCOPE This procedure applies to all blood spot specimens
received in the laboratory for the determination of the IDUA activity
level, which is instrumental in the diagnosis of
Mucopolysaccharidosis Type I.
4. DEFINITION Mucopolysaccharidosis Type I (MPS I) is a lysosomal
storage disease caused by the deficiency of the enzyme alpha-L-
iduronidase (IDUA). Measurement of IDUA activity in dried blood
spots is a key diagnostic biomarker for MPS I.
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Type: Dried blood spot (DBS)
• Collection: Ensure collection date and time are recorded
• Transportation: Specimens should be transported at ambient
temperature.
• Stability: DBS specimens are stable for up to 30 days at room
temperature.
6. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Equipment: Plate reader, centrifuge, pipettes, incubator.
• Reagents: Enzyme substrate, buffer solutions, IDUA assay kit.
• Supplies: 96-well plates, gloves, lab coats, absorbent materials.
7. PROCEDURE A. Preparation
1. Verify specimen integrity and identification details.
2. Punch out required DBS samples and place in 96-well reaction
plates.
3. Prepare substrate solution according to assay kit instructions.
B. Enzyme Assay
1. Add 100 µL of prepared substrate solution to each well
containing DBS sample.
2. Incubate plates at 37°C for 2 hours to allow enzymatic reaction.
3. Stop the reaction by adding 50 µL of stop solution to each well,
as per kit instructions.
C. Measurement
1. Measure fluorescence or absorbance using the plate reader at
the specified wavelength.
2. Record the data for each well.
D. Calibration and Controls
1. Include appropriate enzyme activity controls (positive and
negative) and calibrators in each run.
2. Verify that control results are within acceptable ranges before
proceeding.
E. Data Analysis
1. Analyze raw data and calculate IDUA activity based on
standards and control samples.
2. Normalize enzyme activity to control samples and calibrators to
confirm results accuracy.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Document all findings and generate a comprehensive report.
2. Verify results accuracy through detailed review by the
supervising technologist.
3. Report findings in accordance with laboratory guidelines,
incorporating contextual interpretation for MPS I diagnosis.
9. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Perform regular QC assessments, comparing control results
against established benchmarks.
2. Implement corrective actions for any deviations in control
ranges or assay accuracy.
3. Maintain documentation of all QC checks along with corrective
actions.
10. METHOD LIMITATIONS Refer to assay kit instructions for
limitations regarding reagent specificity, interference factors, and
equipment compatibility.
11. REFERENCES Include relevant publications and manufacturer’s
inserts for the IDUA assay kit and other related methodology.
