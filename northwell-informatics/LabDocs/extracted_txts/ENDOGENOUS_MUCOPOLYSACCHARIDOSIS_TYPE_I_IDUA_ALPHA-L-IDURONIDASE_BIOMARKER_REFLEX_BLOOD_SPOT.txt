Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
TITLE: Analytical Phase Protocol for Endogenous
Mucopolysaccharidosis Type I (IDUA [Alpha-L-iduronidase])
Biomarker Reflex, Blood Spot
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for the analytical phase of generating results
for Endogenous Mucopolysaccharidosis Type I (IDUA [Alpha-L-
iduronidase]) Biomarker Reflex, using blood spot samples. This
protocol ensures the accurate analysis and documentation of the
alpha-L-iduronidase enzyme activity to diagnose
Mucopolysaccharidosis Type I (MPS I).
1. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all personnel performing the IDUA enzyme
activity assay in the laboratory. The document encompasses steps
from the receipt of blood spot samples to the generation of analytical
results.
1. RESPONSIBILITIES
• Laboratory technicians are responsible for performing enzyme
activity assays according to this SOP.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring all staff are trained and
adhere to the SOP.
• Quality control managers are responsible for validating the results
and ensuring compliance with regulatory standards.
1. MATERIALS 4.1 Equipment
• Microplate reader capable of measuring absorbance at 405 nm
• Incubator maintained at 37°C
• Refrigerated centrifuge
• P20 & P200 pipettes
• Vortex mixer
4.2 Reagents and Supplies
• Alpha-L-iduronidase (IDUA) assay substrate
• Enzyme extraction buffer
• Stop solution (e.g., sodium carbonate)
• Calibration standards (control samples with known IDUA activity)
• Quality control (QC) materials
• Blood spot collection cards
• 96-well microplates
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENT AND STABILITY
• Specimen: Dried blood spots collected on validated filter paper
cards
• Stability: Store blood spot samples at room temperature for up to
one month or frozen at -20°C for up to six months.
1. PROCEDURE
6.1 Sample Preparation
1. Cut a 6-mm diameter disc from the dried blood spot (DBS) and
place it in a microcentrifuge tube.
2. Add 200 µL of enzyme extraction buffer to the tube.
3. Vortex for 30 seconds to ensure thorough mixing.
4. Incubate the tube at 37°C for 1 hour.
5. Centrifuge the tube at 5000 x g for 10 minutes at 4°C.
6. Transfer the supernatant to a clean microcentrifuge tube and
keep it on ice.
6.2 Enzyme Activity Assay
1. Pipette 50 µL of the extracted enzyme solution into each well of
a 96-well microplate.
2. Add 50 µL of IDUA assay substrate to each well.
3. Incubate the microplate at 37°C for 2 hours.
4. Stop the reaction by adding 50 µL of stop solution to each well.
5. Measure the absorbance at 405 nm using a microplate reader.
6.3 Quality Control and Calibration
1. Run calibration standards and QC samples alongside patient
samples.
2. Ensure the QC results are within the established range before
proceeding with patient sample analysis.
3. If QC results are out of range, troubleshoot the assay, repeat
the QC and affected patient samples.
6.4 Result Calculation and Interpretation
1. Calculate the enzyme activity using the absorbance values from
sample and standard wells.
2. Use the following formula to calculate IDUA activity:
(Absorbance of sample - Absorbance of blank) / (Absorbance of
standard - Absorbance of blank) x standard activity
3. Express the result in units of enzyme activity per volume of
blood (e.g., nmol/hr/mL).
6.5 Reporting Results
1. Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
2. Review results for consistency and accuracy.
3. If the patient's IDUA activity is significantly lower than the
established reference range, recommend further confirmatory
testing.
4. REFERENCE INTERVAL
• Establish reference interval in consultation with clinical guidelines
and literature for IDUA activity in blood spots.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Potential for assay sensitivity to degradation of enzyme activity
over time.
• Ensure samples are properly stored and handled to prevent
degradation.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If assay results are inconsistent, repeat enzyme extraction and
analysis steps, check equipment calibration, and validate
reagents for expiration and correct preparation.
1. DOCUMENTATION
• Document all testing and quality control measures in accordance
with laboratory standards.
• Maintain records of calibration and QC data, along with assay run
logs.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's protocol for IDUA [Alpha-L-iduronidase] enzyme
assay kits.
• Relevant scientific literature on Mucopolysaccharidosis Type I
diagnostics.
1. REVIEW AND APPROVAL
• SOP must be reviewed annually or as needed by laboratory
management and approved by the laboratory director.
