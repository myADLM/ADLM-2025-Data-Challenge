Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Endometrial Stromal Tumors (EST), 7p15
(JAZF1), 6p21.32 (PHF1), 17p13.3 (YWHAE) Rearrangement,
FISH, Tissue
1. Purpose To describe the analytical process for detecting 7p15
(JAZF1), 6p21.32 (PHF1), and 17p13.3 (YWHAE)
rearrangements in endometrial stromal tumors (EST) using
Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) on formalin-fixed,
paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue specimens.
2. Scope This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel involved in
the analysis process of endometrial stromal tumors using FISH
technology.
3. Responsibility It is the responsibility of all trained personnel to
follow the procedures detailed in this SOP. The laboratory
supervisor is responsible for ensuring adherence to this
protocol and for addressing any deviations.
4. Specimen Requirements
◦ Specimens should be FFPE tissue blocks or unstained
slides (4-5µm thick).
◦ Ensure specimens are labeled accurately with patient
identifiers and accompanied by a requisition form.
5. Equipment and Reagents
◦ Fluorescence microscope
◦ FISH probes specific to JAZF1, PHF1, and YWHAE
◦ Slide pretreatment kit
◦ Denaturation and hybridization solutions
◦ Buffer solutions for wash steps
◦ DAPI (4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) counterstain
◦ Mounting medium
6. Procedure
6.1 Pre-Treatment of Slides
• Deparaffinize slides by placing them in a series of xylene baths (3
changes, 5 minutes per bath).
• Rehydrate slides through a graded ethanol series (100%, 95%,
85%, and 70% ethanol, 2 minutes each).
• Allow slides to air dry completely.
6.2 Pretreatment and Proteolytic Digestion
• Perform pretreatment steps as outlined in the FISH pretreatment
kit instructions.
• Incubate slides in proteolytic enzyme solution at 37°C for the time
recommended by the manufacturer.
• Rinse slides in buffer solution and proceed with dehydration (70%,
85%, 95%, and 100% ethanol series).
6.3 Denaturation and Hybridization
• Apply FISH probe mixture (containing JAZF1, PHF1, YWHAE
probes) to the target area of the slide.
• Cover the area with a coverslip and seal edges with rubber
cement or nail polish.
• Denature slide-probe mixture at 73°C for 5 minutes.
• Hybridize slides overnight (14-18 hours) in a humidified chamber
at 37°C.
6.4 Post-Hybridization Washing
• Remove coverslip gently and immerse slides in post-hybridization
wash buffer (0.4X SSC/0.3% NP-40) at 73°C for 2 minutes.
• Perform additional washes in 2X SSC/0.1% NP-40 at room
temperature.
• Rinse briefly in distilled water.
6.5 Counterstaining and Mounting
• Counterstain slides with DAPI for 5 minutes.
• Rinse slides in distilled water and air dry in the dark.
• Apply mounting medium and coverslip.
1. Analysis and Interpretation
◦ Examine slides under a fluorescence microscope.
◦ Record and interpret signals for each probe (JAZF1 at 7p15,
PHF1 at 6p21.32, and YWHAE at 17p13.3).
◦ A positive result will show split or rearranged signals, while a
negative result exhibits intact signals.
2. Quality Control
◦ Include a known positive and negative control with each
batch of patient slides.
◦ Document control results and ensure they fall within
acceptable ranges prior to interpretation of patient samples.
3. Reporting Results
◦ Record FISH results for each probe with corresponding
patient's identifiers.
◦ Prepare a detailed report summarizing findings.
◦ Ensure results are verified and reviewed by the supervising
pathologist.
4. Troubleshooting
• If controls do not perform as expected, review reagent integrity
and protocol steps.
• Repeat hybridization or washing steps as necessary.
