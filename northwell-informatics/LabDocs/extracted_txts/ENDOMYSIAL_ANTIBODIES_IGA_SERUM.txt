Standard Operating Procedure: Analytical Phase for Generating
Results for Endomysial Antibodies (EMA) IgA, Serum
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized protocol for the analytical phase in the
determination of endomysial antibodies (EMA) IgA in serum samples,
ensuring accuracy, reliability, and reproducibility of results.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to the clinical laboratory performing
endomysial IgA antibody testing using indirect immunofluorescence
assay (IFA).
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory personnel to
perform the analysis according to this SOP, including proper handling
and documentation of samples, reagents, and results.
4. MATERIALS AND REAGENTS
• Patient serum samples
• Monkey esophagus tissue slides (commercial assay kit)
• FITC-conjugated anti-human IgA antibody
• Positive and negative control sera
• Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)
• Mounting medium
• Coverslips
• Humidity chamber
• Fluorescence microscope
• Microtiter plates
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Disposable gloves and personal protective equipment (PPE)
5. EQUIPMENT
• Fluorescence microscope
• Incubator (37°C)
• Centrifuge
6. SPECIMEN
Preferred: 1 mL serum Sample Stability: Stored at 2-8°C for up to 7
days, or frozen at -20°C for longer storage. Unacceptable samples:
Hemolyzed, lipemic, or contaminated samples
7. PROCEDURE
7.1. Sample Preparation
• Thaw frozen serum samples at room temperature and mix well.
• Centrifuge all serum samples at 2000 x g for 10 minutes to
remove particulates.
7.2. Slide Preparation
• Label each monkey esophagus tissue slide with patient
identification and control identifiers.
• Apply 10 μL of serum or control to a designated well on the tissue
slide.
• Incubate the slides in a humidity chamber at room temperature for
30 minutes.
7.3. Washing
• Remove slides from the humidity chamber.
• Wash slides by immersing in PBS for 5 minutes. Repeat this
washing step 2 more times, using fresh PBS each time.
• Shake off excess PBS gently from the slides.
7.4. Staining
• Apply 10 μL of FITC-conjugated anti-human IgA antibody to each
well.
• Incubate the slides in a humidity chamber at room temperature for
30 minutes, protected from light.
7.5. Washing and Mounting
• Repeat the washing step as described in 7.3 to remove unbound
antibodies.
• Apply one drop of mounting medium to each well.
• Gently place coverslips on the slides to avoid trapping air
bubbles.
7.6. Microscopy and Analysis
• Examine the slides under a fluorescence microscope using the
appropriate filter set for FITC (typically 450-490 nm excitation).
• Identify the presence of endomysial IgA antibodies by observing
the appearance of the characteristic green fluorescence at the
endomysial connective tissue surrounding individual muscle
fibers.
• Document the fluorescence patterns and intensity for each
sample, and compare them with controls.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include positive and negative control sera in each assay run to
ensure assay performance.
• Control results must fall within predefined limits.
• If any control fails, the entire batch of patient samples must be re-
assayed.
• Document all QC results and any corrective actions taken.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results are categorized as positive or negative based on the
fluorescence observed.
• The intensity of fluorescence should be graded (e.g., 1+, 2+, 3+,
4+) to give an indication of antibody titer.
• Results are verified by a senior technologist or supervisor before
being reported in the Laboratory Information System.
10. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
Positive Result: Presence of characteristic green fluorescence
indicating the presence of endomysial IgA antibodies. Negative
Result: Absence of characteristic green fluorescence indicating the
absence of endomysial IgA antibodies.
11. LIMITATIONS
• Hemolysis, lipemia, or microbial contamination may interfere with
test results.
• Follow Siemens package insert for antigen-specific limitations.
