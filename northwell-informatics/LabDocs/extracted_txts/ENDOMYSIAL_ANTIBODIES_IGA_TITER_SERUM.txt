Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Endomysial Antibodies (IgA), Titer,
Serum
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to provide standardized procedures for
the analytical phase of generating results for Endomysial Antibodies
(IgA), Titer, Serum. This procedure ensures accurate and reliable
results are reported, maintaining consistency and adherence to
regulatory requirements.
Responsibility:
Laboratory personnel are responsible for performing and
documenting all steps of the analytical phase as defined in this
procedure.
Supervisors are responsible for ensuring that personnel are trained
and that all procedures are followed correctly.
1. PRINCIPLE AND/OR PURPOSE:
Endomysial Antibodies (IgA) are determined on serum samples using
an indirect immunofluorescence assay. This assay is used to detect
the presence and titer of IgA antibodies against endomysial tissue,
which helps in diagnosing celiac disease.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/Acceptable Specimen:
• Serum samples collected in a red-top tube or serum separator
tube (SST).
• Collect a minimum of 2 mL of blood.
• Allow the blood to clot at room temperature before centrifugation.
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
• Samples collected in anticoagulant tubes (e.g., EDTA, heparin).
• Samples that have not been stored properly (frozen, exposure to
high temperature).
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Reagents: Commercially available, validated kit for Endomysial
Antibodies (IgA) detection and titration.
• Fluorescent microscope
• Positive and negative control sera
• Wash buffer
• PBS (phosphate-buffered saline)
• Slides pre-coated with endomysial tissue substrate
• Secondary antibody conjugated with a fluorescent dye
• Humidity chamber for incubations
• Pipettes and tips
• Gloves and protective gear
• Timer
• Centrifuge
1. PROCEDURE
A. Reagent Preparation:
• Prepare wash buffer and PBS as directed by the kit manufacturer.
• Reconstitute and dilute controls and patient sera according to
manufacturer’s instructions.
B. Sample Preparation:
• Centrifuge serum samples at 3000 RPM for 10-15 minutes.
• Aliquot samples if necessary and label properly.
C. Assay Procedure:
1. Slide Preparation:
◦ Place pre-coated slides in a humidity chamber.
2. Applying Samples:
◦ Add 10 µL of patient serum and controls to designated wells
on the slide.
◦ Ensure samples are properly distributed on the tissue
substrate.
3. Incubation:
◦ Incubate slides in the humidity chamber at room
temperature for 30 minutes.
4. Washing:
◦ Gently rinse slides with PBS or wash buffer to remove
unbound serum proteins.
◦ Place slides in wash buffer and agitate gently for 5 minutes.
Repeat this step twice more.
5. Secondary Antibody Application:
◦ Add 10 µL of fluorescent-labeled secondary antibody to
each well.
◦ Incubate in the humidity chamber at room temperature for
another 30 minutes.
6. Final Wash:
◦ Repeat wash steps with PBS or wash buffer.
7. Mounting:
◦ Apply mounting medium to slides.
◦ Cover with coverslip carefully to avoid bubbles.
D. Microscopy:
• Examine slides using a fluorescent microscope.
• Identify endomysial-specific fluorescence in patient samples and
compare to control samples.
• Record titer as the highest dilution at which specific fluorescence
is observed.
1. QUALITY CONTROL:
• Include positive and negative control sera on each run to ensure
assay reliability.
• Record control results on a lot-specific quality control log.
• If controls do not meet specifications, do not report patient results
and troubleshoot assay according to internal protocol.
1. REPORTING RESULTS:
• Enter results into Laboratory Information System (LIS) as titers.
• Positive results should be titered to the endpoint and documented
clearly.
• Any critical or unexpected results should be reviewed and verified
by a senior technologist or supervisor before reporting.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS:
• Negative: No specific fluorescence observed.
• Positive: Endpoint titer at which specific fluorescence is observed.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
• The assay is limited by the quality of the microscopical
examination.
• False positives may occur with non-specific binding; samples
need to be reviewed critically.
• False negatives may be due to low antibody levels or technical
errors.
• Specificity and sensitivity depend on the proper execution of the
assay according to the manufacturer's instructions.

• Manufacturer’s Instructions for Use (IFU) of the Endomysial
Antibody (IgA) detection kit.
• Laboratory Quality Control guidelines.
• CLSI guidelines for Immunofluorescence Assays.
APPROVAL AND REVIEW:
• This SOP must be reviewed annually by the laboratory supervisor
or designated personnel.
• Changes to the SOP may be made as necessary to comply with
regulatory standards and to incorporate new best practices.
VERSION HISTORY:
• Version 1.0: Initial creation in October 2023.
By following this SOP, laboratory personnel will ensure accurate
detection and reporting of Endomysial Antibodies (IgA), maintaining
high quality and consistent results.
