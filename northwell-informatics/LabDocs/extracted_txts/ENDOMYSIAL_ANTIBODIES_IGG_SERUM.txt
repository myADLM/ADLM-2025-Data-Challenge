STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES (SOPs) FOR
ENDOMYSIAL ANTIBODIES, IGG, SERUM
1. PURPOSE:
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the standard procedures for the
analytical phase of generating results for Endomysial Antibodies, IgG,
Serum to ensure consistent, accurate, and reliable results.
Responsibility:
1. Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for the
accurate performance and documentation of the Endomysial
Antibodies, IgG, Serum assay.
2. Supervisors ensure that the tests are performed and
documented according to these procedures and that any
corrective actions taken are appropriate and recorded.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS:
Specimen Type:
• Serum
Preferred/Acceptable:
• 5 mL of serum collected in a serum separator tube (SST). After
clot formation, the sample should be centrifuged, and serum
should be separated and aliquoted into a properly labeled
container.
Unacceptable:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples
• Specimens collected in anticoagulant tubes (e.g., EDTA, heparin,
or citrate)
Storage and Stability:
• Serum specimens are stable for 7 days when refrigerated at
2-8°C.
• For longer storage, specimens should be frozen at -20°C, where
they are stable for up to 3 months.
• Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
3. REAGENTS AND EQUIPMENT:
Reagents:
• Endomysial Antibodies, IgG assay kit (specific to manufacturer’s
instructions)
• Wash buffer
• Substrate solution
• Stop solution
• Positive and negative controls
Equipment:
• Microplate reader with appropriate filters
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes and tips
• Incubator at 37°C
• Timer
• Tubes and racks
4. PROCEDURE:
A. Preparation:
1. Allow all reagents and specimens to come to room temperature
before use.
2. Prepare wash buffer according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
3. Set up the microplate, ensuring all wells are labeled
appropriately for controls, standards, and patient samples.
B. Assay Procedure:
1. Sample and Reagent Addition:
◦ Add 100 µL of patient serum, controls, and standards to the
respective wells.
◦ Incubate the plate at 37°C for 30 minutes.
2. Washing:
◦ Wash the wells 5 times with wash buffer, ensuring complete
removal of any liquid between washes.
3. Detection Antibody Addition:
◦ Add 100 µL of the detection antibody to each well.
◦ Incubate the plate at 37°C for 30 minutes.
4. Washing:
◦ Wash the wells 5 times with wash buffer.
5. Substrate Addition:
◦ Add 100 µL of substrate solution to each well.
◦ Incubate the plate in the dark for 15 minutes at room
temperature.
6. Stopping the Reaction:
◦ Add 100 µL of stop solution to each well to stop the reaction.
7. Reading the Plate:
◦ Read the optical density (OD) of each well at 450 nm using
the microplate reader within 15 minutes of adding the stop
solution.
C. Calculation and Interpretation:
1. Calculate the mean OD values for the standards and controls.
2. Construct a standard curve by plotting the mean OD values of
the standards against their respective concentrations.
3. Determine the concentration of Endomysial Antibodies, IgG in
the patient samples by interpolating their OD values from the
standard curve.
4. Refer to the assay kit insert for the specific cut-off values to
determine positive or negative results.
5. QUALITY CONTROL:
• Run positive and negative controls with each batch of specimens
tested.
• Ensure control values fall within the specified ranges provided by
the manufacturer.
• Document all quality control results in the appropriate logbook
and identify any deviations from acceptable ranges.
• If controls fall outside acceptable ranges, troubleshoot and repeat
the assay if necessary.
6. REPORTING RESULTS:
• Document all patient results with unique identifiers to avoid mix-
ups.
• Report the results according to site-specific reporting guidelines.
• Include the interpretation of the results (positive or negative)
based on the standard cut-off values.
7. REFERENCES:
• Manufacturer’s assay kit insert.
• Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines for
immunoassays.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
• Limitations related to interfering substances such as hemolysis,
lipemia, or icterus.
• Ensure adherence to manufacturer’s storage and handling
recommendations for reagents and samples.
9. REVIEW AND REVISION:
• This SOP will be reviewed annually or when new procedures or
tests are introduced.
• Any significant changes will be communicated to all relevant
personnel.
