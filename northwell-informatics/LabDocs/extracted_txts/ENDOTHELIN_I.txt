Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Endothelin-I Results
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedures for the analytical
phase of Endothelin-I (ET-1) testing in order to ensure accurate and
reproducible results. Endothelin-I (ET-1) is a potent vasoconstrictor
involved in various physiological and pathological processes, and its
measurement can provide valuable information for clinical
diagnostics and research.
Responsibility: All laboratory personnel conducting Endothelin-I
testing are responsible for adhering to the procedures outlined in this
SOP. Supervisors are responsible for training personnel and ensuring
compliance.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/Acceptable:
• Plasma collected using EDTA or citrate as an anticoagulant.
Heparinized plasma is acceptable but not preferred due to
potential interference.
• Serum samples, if applicable, should be allowed to clot
completely before centrifugation.
• A minimum volume of 1 mL is required for testing, though 2 mL is
recommended to allow for retesting or additional analyses.
Unacceptable:
• Specimens that have undergone multiple freeze-thaw cycles.
• Specimens with visible hemolysis, lipemia, or turbidity.
• Specimens not properly labeled or documented with collection
date and time.
1. REAGENTS, EQUIPMENT, AND SUPPLIES
• Endothelin-I assay kit (manufacturer and catalog number to be
specified)
• Microplate reader capable of measuring absorbance at the
required wavelength
• Pipettes and pipette tips (calibrated for accuracy)
• Disposable gloves, lab coats, and other personal protective
equipment (PPE)
• Reagent reservoirs, microcentrifuge tubes, and plate sealers
• Deionized or distilled water
• Calibrators and controls (provided with the assay kit or externally
validated)
• Standard laboratory glassware for reagent preparation
1. PROCEDURE
A) Reagent Preparation:
1. Allow all reagents and samples to reach room temperature
before use.
2. Reconstitute standards and controls according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
3. Prepare wash buffer, substrate solution, and stop solution if not
provided as ready-to-use.
B) Sample Preparation:
1. Centrifuge blood specimens at 2000-3000 x g for 10-15 minutes
to obtain plasma or serum.
2. Aliquot the clear plasma or serum into appropriately labeled
tubes.
3. Store aliquots at -20°C or lower if not analyzed immediately.
Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
C) Assay Procedure:
1. Add the appropriate volume of standards, controls, and
samples to designated wells in the microplate.
2. Add the antibody or enzyme conjugate to each well according
to the assay kit instructions.
3. Incubate the plate at the specified temperature and time.
4. Wash the plate thoroughly using the prepared wash buffer.
5. Add the substrate solution to each well and incubate for the
specified time.
6. Add the stop solution to each well to halt the reaction.
7. Measure the absorbance at the specified wavelength using a
microplate reader.
D) Quality Control:
1. Run quality control samples (both high and low) with each
batch of tests to ensure assay performance.
2. Accept or reject runs based on predetermined criteria for
control values.
3. Document and take corrective actions for any quality control
failures, including reanalysis and troubleshooting.
4. CALCULATION AND REPORTING RESULTS
A) Calculation:
1. Generate a standard curve by plotting the absorbance values of
the standards against their known concentrations.
2. Calculate sample concentrations by interpolation from the
standard curve.
3. Ensure all calculations are reviewed and verified by a second
technologist to maintain accuracy.
B) Reporting:
1. Enter the final ET-1 concentrations into the laboratory
information system (LIS).
2. Ensure results are reviewed and verified by the responsible
technologist.
3. Report results to the requesting physician or clinical team
promptly.
4. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the manufacturer's kit insert for specific limitations, including
potential interferences, cross-reactivities, and conditions that may
affect assay performance.

1. RECORD KEEPING
All records, including reagent lot numbers, quality control results, and
sample data, must be kept according to laboratory policy and
relevant regulatory requirements.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING
Refer to the manufacturer's troubleshooting guide for common issues
encountered during the Endothelin-I assay. For persistent problems,
contact the technical support team of the assay kit manufacturer.
