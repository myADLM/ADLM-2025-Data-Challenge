Protocol for Analytical Phase of Generating Results for
Plantain, English (Plantago lanceolata), IgE, Serum
1. PURPOSE
This protocol provides detailed instructions for the analytical phase of
measuring specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies against
English Plantain (Plantago lanceolata) in serum samples. The
procedure is intended to ensure accurate and consistent results in
allergen-specific IgE testing.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all laboratory personnel performing this
assay to familiarize themselves with this protocol and follow it
precisely. Supervisors must ensure that all technologists are
adequately trained and competent to perform this assay.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred Specimen: Serum (minimum 0.5 mL)
• Collection: Blood should be collected in serum separator tubes
(SST). Allow the blood to clot for 30 minutes to 1 hour and then
centrifuge at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes to separate serum.
• Stability: Serum is stable for up to 48 hours when stored at
2-8°C. For longer storage, serum should be frozen at -20°C or
colder.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• ImmunoCAP 250 or comparable automated Immunoassay
Analyzer
• Specific allergen reagent for English Plantain (Plantago
lanceolata), IgE
• Controls: Positive and negative IgE controls
• Calibrators
• Pipettes and tips
• Serum separator tubes (SST)
• Centrifuge
• Standard laboratory PPE (gloves, lab coat, protective eyewear)
5. PROCEDURE
5.1 Preparation for Analysis:
• Thaw frozen specimens at room temperature and mix gently
before analysis.
• Ensure that calibrators, controls, and reagent kits are at room
temperature prior to use.
• Load the ImmunoCAP 250 analyzer with the necessary reagents,
calibrators, controls, and serum samples following the
manufacturer’s instructions.
5.2 Calibration and Quality Control:
• Calibrate the assay using the provided calibrators. Perform
calibration in accordance with the manufacturer's guidelines and
laboratory protocols.
• Run positive and negative controls at the beginning of each
testing run and after calibration. Document control results and
ensure they are within the acceptable range before proceeding
with patient sample analysis.
5.3 Sample Analysis:
• Label each sample tube or vial clearly with the patient
identification number.
• Place the serum samples in the designated sample rack of the
ImmunoCAP 250 analyzer.
• Initiate the assay by selecting the appropriate method for English
Plantain (Plantago lanceolata) specific IgE according to the
analyzer’s operating instructions.
• The analyzer will process the samples, and results will be
automatically generated and transmitted to the Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
6. INTERPRETATION AND REPORTING OF RESULTS
• Review all test results for consistency with the quality control
data.
• IgE values are reported in kU/L (kilo units per liter).
• Reference intervals for allergen-specific IgE:
◦ <0.1 kU/L: Negative
◦ 0.1-0.35 kU/L: Borderline/Equivocal
◦ 0.35 kU/L: Positive
• Notify the attending clinician of any critical findings immediately as
per laboratory policy.
7. QUALITY CONTROL AND TROUBLESHOOTING
• If controls do not fall within the established ranges, do not report
patient results. Investigate and resolve the issue, perform
necessary maintenance or troubleshooting, and re-run controls
before proceeding with patient samples.
• Document any deviations or instrument malfunctions and the
corrective actions taken.
8. DOCUMENTATION
• Record the assay run details, including lot numbers of reagents,
calibrators, controls, and any issues in an assay logbook.
• Ensure that temperature and maintenance logs of the
ImmunoCAP 250 analyzer are up-to-date.
• All results must be reviewed and verified by a qualified
technologist before reporting.
