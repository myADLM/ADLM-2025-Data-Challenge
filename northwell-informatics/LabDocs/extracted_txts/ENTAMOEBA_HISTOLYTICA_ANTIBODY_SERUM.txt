Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase
Title: Analytical Procedure for Entamoeba Histolytica Antibody,
Serum
1. PURPOSE: To provide detailed instructions for the determination
of Entamoeba histolytica antibodies in serum using Enzyme-Linked
Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) or related serological methods. This
test aids in diagnosing infections caused by Entamoeba histolytica, a
pathogenic amoeba responsible for amoebiasis.
2. RESPONSIBILITY: Laboratory technologists and other designated
laboratory personnel are responsible for performing this test
according to the described protocol. It is the responsibility of the
supervisor to ensure all personnel are adequately trained and
competent in performing the assay.
3. DEFINITIONS:
• ELISA: Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay, a common
serological test typically used to detect antibodies.
• Entamoeba histolytica: A parasitic protozoan that causes
amoebiasis.
• Antibodies: Proteins produced by the immune system in
response to the presence of specific antigens.
4. SPECIMEN:
• Preferred Specimen: Serum obtained by centrifuging clotted
blood.
• Volume: A minimum of 1 mL of serum is required.
• Storage: Serum samples can be stored at 2-8°C for up to 72
hours. For long-term storage, samples should be frozen at -20°C
or lower.
5. MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT:
• ELISA reader (microplate spectrophotometer)
• ELISA kit for Entamoeba histolytica antibody detection
• Microplate washer (automated or manual)
• Single-channel and multi-channel pipettes
• Incubator set at 37°C
• Timer
• Laboratory centrifuge
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
6. REAGENTS:
• ELISA plate pre-coated with E. histolytica antigens
• Wash buffer (typically phosphate-buffered saline with Tween 20)
• Sample diluent
• Controls (positive and negative)
• Substrate solution (e.g., TMB)
• Stop solution (e.g., sulfuric acid 0.2N)
7. PROCEDURE: 7.1 Preparation and Setup:
• Ensure all reagents and samples are at room temperature.
• Label all necessary tubes, vials, and the ELISA plate for sample
and control identification.
• Configure the ELISA reader according to the manufacturer’s
instructions for the specific kit used.
7.2 Assay Procedure:
1. Sample and Control Preparation:
◦ Dilute serum samples in the sample diluent as specified by
the kit instructions.
◦ Include positive and negative controls supplied with the kit.
2. Plate Loading:
◦ Pipette the diluted samples and controls into designated
wells of the ELISA plate.
◦ Avoid cross-contamination by using a new pipette tip for
each sample and control.
◦ Seal the plate with adhesive cover.
3. Incubation:
◦ Incubate the plate at 37°C for the time specified in the kit
instructions (typically 30-60 minutes).
4. Washing:
◦ After incubation, remove the adhesive cover and wash the
plate as directed (usually 3-4 times) with wash buffer using a
microplate washer or manual washing procedure.
5. Addition of Conjugate:
◦ Add the enzyme-conjugated antibody to each well as
specified in the kit.
◦ Incubate again at 37°C for the specified time.
6. Final Wash:
◦ Perform the washing procedure again as specified in step 4.
7. Substrate Reaction:
◦ Add the substrate solution to each well.
◦ Incubate the plate in the dark for the recommended time
(typically 10-20 minutes).
8. Stop Reaction:
◦ Add the stop solution to each well to terminate the substrate
reaction. Ensure equal volumes of stop solution are added
to all wells to maintain consistency.
7.3 Reading and Interpretation:
• Read the optical density (OD) values of the wells at the
wavelength specified by the kit, usually 450 nm, using the ELISA
reader.
• Compare the sample absorbance values with the positive and
negative controls to determine the presence of antibodies.
• Calculate the results based on the kit’s provided formula or
software.
8. QUALITY CONTROL:
• Run positive and negative controls with each assay to ensure
proper test performance.
• Any run where the controls do not fall within the expected ranges
should be considered invalid, and the assay must be repeated.
9. REPORTING RESULTS:
• Results should be recorded and stored in the laboratory
information system.
• Positive results should be reviewed and verified by a senior
technologist or supervisor.
• Results interpretation must be followed as per the kit
manufacturer’s guidelines.
10. REFERENCE INTERVALS:
• The results should be interpreted based on the cut-off values
provided in the kit insert.
• Typically, results are reported as Positive, Negative, or
Equivocal based on the OD values relative to the cut-off.
11. LIMITATIONS:
• Cross-reactivity with other protozoan infections may occur,
leading to false-positive results.
• The test's diagnostic performance may be affected by sample
integrity and handling.
12. SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS:
• Follow all standard laboratory safety procedures.
• Use PPE at all times.
• Handle all biological specimens with care to prevent exposure to
potentially infectious materials.

This protocol aims to standardize the analytical phase for serum
Entamoeba histolytica antibody testing, ensuring high-quality,
reliable, and consistent results. Ensure adherence to each step,
maintaining quality control and accurate documentation throughout
the procedure.
