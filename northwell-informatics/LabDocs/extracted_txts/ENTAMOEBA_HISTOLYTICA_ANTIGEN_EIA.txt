Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Analytical Phase for
ENTAMOEBA HISTOLYTICA ANTIGEN, EIA
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to outline the standardized steps for
the analytical phase of generating test results for Entamoeba
histolytica antigen using Enzyme Immunoassay (EIA).
2. RESPONSIBILITY
All designated laboratory staff are responsible for conducting the
assay as described in this SOP. Any deviations to the procedure or
identified issues must be reported to the designated supervisor
immediately.
3. DEFINITIONS
Entamoeba histolytica: A parasitic amoebozoan primarily known for
causing amoebiasis.
EIA: Enzyme Immunoassay, a biochemical technique used to detect
the presence of an antigen in a sample.
4. PROCEDURE
Specimens:
• Acceptable Specimen Types: Fresh or frozen stool samples,
unpreserved or in a transport medium.
• Unacceptable Specimens: Stool samples containing interfering
substances or those outside the appropriate time window/
refrigeration requirements.
Reagents and Supplies:
• EIA kit for Entamoeba histolytica antigen detection.
• Microtiter plates.
• Wash buffer.
• Sample diluent.
• Conjugate reagent.
• Substrate solution.
• Stop solution.
• Positive and negative controls.
• Pipettes and pipette tips.
• Plate reader.
• Distilled or deionized water.
Procedure Steps:
Preparation:
1. Reagent Preparation: Follow the manufacturer's instructions
for reagent preparation, ensuring that all reagents are brought
to room temperature before use.
2. Controls Preparation:
◦ Prepare the positive and negative controls included in the
kit.
◦ Include controls in each batch of tests to validate test
results.
Sample Preparation:
1. Sample Handling:
◦ Mix stool specimens thoroughly before processing.
◦ Prepare stool samples according to the EIA kit instructions,
typically involving diluting the sample in the provided sample
diluent.
Assay Procedure:
1. Plate Setup:
◦ Allocate wells in the microtiter plate for each patient sample,
positive and negative controls, in accordance with the plate
layout template.
◦ Pipette the prepared samples and controls into the assigned
wells.
2. Incubation:
◦ Incubate the plate at the specified temperature (typically
37°C) for the designated time (e.g., 1 hour), ensuring proper
coverage to avoid evaporation.
3. Washing Steps:
◦ Wash the plate thoroughly with the wash buffer following
incubation to remove unbound material.
◦ Ensure all residual liquid is removed by tapping the plate
firmly on absorbent paper.
4. Conjugate Addition:
◦ Add the enzyme-conjugate reagent to each well.
◦ Incubate the plate again at the specified temperature for the
designated time.
5. Second Wash Step:
◦ Wash the plate again thoroughly as per the manufacturer's
protocol.
6. Substrate Addition:
◦ Add the substrate solution to each well. Incubate the plate in
the dark or as required to allow color development.
7. Stopping the Reaction:
◦ Add the stop solution to each well to halt the enzymatic
reaction.
Reading and Interpretation:
1. Plate Reading:
◦ Read the plate at the required wavelength (e.g., 450 nm)
using a microplate reader.
◦ Record the optical density (OD) values for each well.
2. Result Interpretation:
◦ Compare the OD values of the samples against the positive
and negative controls.
◦ Refer to the EIA kit instructions to determine the cut-off
values for positive and negative results.
◦ Report the results as positive or negative based on the OD
readings and cut-off values.
Quality Control:
1. QC Verification:
◦ Confirm that the positive and negative controls have
provided the expected results.
◦ If controls fail, invalidate the run, and repeat the assay.
Reporting Results:
1. Data Entry:
◦ Enter the results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
in accordance with site-specific guidelines.
2. Review:
◦ Ensure all data is reviewed and verified by a qualified
technologist before releasing the results.
5. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions for the EIA kit.
• Laboratory Information System (LIS) user manual.
6. DOCUMENTATION
• Ensure that the patient sample information, including unique
identifiers, control results, and any deviations, are adequately
documented.
• Maintain records of all EIA assays performed, along with
completed quality control results.
7. REVISIONS
Any revisions to the procedure will be documented with the revision
number and the date of the change.
By following this SOP, the laboratory ensures accurate, reliable, and
compliant results for the detection of Entamoeba histolytica antigen
using the EIA method.
