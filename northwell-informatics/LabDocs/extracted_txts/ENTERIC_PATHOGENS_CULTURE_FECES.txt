Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Enteric Pathogens
Culture, Feces
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedure for culturing
enteric pathogens from fecal specimens. The accurate identification
of enteric pathogens aids in the diagnosis and treatment of
gastrointestinal infections.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
All laboratory personnel involved in the microbiological testing of
fecal samples are responsible for following this SOP. It is the
responsibility of the laboratory supervisor to ensure that all
procedures are performed accurately and that staff are adequately
trained.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND HANDLING
Specimen:
• Collection: Freshly collected fecal specimen without any
preservative.
• Volume: Minimum of 1 gram or 1 mL of liquid stool.
• Storage: Specimens should be transported to the laboratory as
soon as possible. If there is a delay in transport, specimens can
be refrigerated at 2-8°C for up to 24 hours.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens in fixatives or preservatives.
• Specimens received more than 24 hours after collection without
refrigeration.
• Specimens leaking or in inappropriate containers.
4. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
• Biological safety cabinet (BSC)
• Sterile inoculating loops
• Sterile containers and pipettes
• Incubators set at the appropriate temperatures
• Bacteriological media (MacConkey agar, Hektoen enteric agar,
Xylose lysine deoxycholate agar, Sorbitol-MacConkey agar,
Campylobacter agar)
• Biochemical test reagents (e.g., TSI, LIA, SIM, Citrate, Urea)
• Microscopy supplies (Gram stain reagents, microscope slides,
immersion oil)
• Quality control organisms
5. PROCEDURE
Preparation and Inoculation:
1. Safety Precautions: Wear appropriate PPE and perform all
procedures involving fecal specimens in a BSC to prevent
exposure.
2. Sample Preparation: Using a sterile inoculating loop or
pipette, transfer a small portion of the fecal specimen to a
sterile container.
3. Primary Inoculation:
◦ Streak the specimen onto primary isolation media:
▪ MacConkey agar
▪ Hektoen enteric agar
▪ Xylose lysine deoxycholate agar
▪ Sorbitol-MacConkey agar (for E. coli O157:H7)
◦ If Campylobacter is suspected, streak onto Campylobacter
agar and incubate under microaerophilic conditions.
Incubation:
1. Incubation Conditions:
◦ MacConkey, Hektoen enteric, and Xylose lysine
deoxycholate agar plates: Incubate at 35-37°C for 18-24
hours.
◦ Sorbitol-MacConkey agar plates: Incubate at 35-37°C for
24-48 hours.
◦ Campylobacter agar plates: Incubate at 42°C in a
microaerophilic atmosphere for 48 hours.
Examination and Subculture:
1. Colony Examination:
◦ Examine plates for characteristic colony morphologies of
potential enteric pathogens such as Salmonella, Shigella, E.
coli O157:H7, and Campylobacter.
◦ Select suspicious colonies for further identification.
2. Subculture and Identification:
◦ Perform subculture onto appropriate media for isolation and
perform Gram staining to verify purity and morphology.
◦ Perform biochemical tests (e.g., TSI, LIA, SIM, Citrate,
Urea) to confirm the identification of isolates. Use
automated systems if available.
◦ For E. coli O157:H7, perform serological testing using
specific antisera.
Quality Control:
1. Quality Control:
◦ Use quality control organisms to validate media and
reagents on a routine basis.
◦ Document the results of quality control testing.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
• Enter final results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
after verifying the identity of the organisms.
• Report out if enteric pathogens such as Salmonella, Shigella,
Campylobacter, or E. coli O157:H7 are isolated.
• Provide susceptibility testing results if required.
7. LIMITATIONS
• The accuracy of this procedure is dependent on the quality of the
specimen submitted.
• Interferences may occur if specimens are contaminated with other
substances.
