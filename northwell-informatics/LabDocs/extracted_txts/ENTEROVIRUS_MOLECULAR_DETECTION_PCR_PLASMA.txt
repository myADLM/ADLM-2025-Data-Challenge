Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Enterovirus, Molecular
Detection, PCR, Plasma
1. PURPOSE
To outline the analytical procedures for the molecular detection of
enterovirus in plasma samples using PCR (Polymerase Chain
Reaction) methodology. This ensures accurate and reliable detection,
aligning with CLIA regulations and laboratory standards.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for
conducting the PCR assay, analyzing the data, and documenting the
results according to this SOP.
2. DEFINITION
Enterovirus is a group of RNA viruses that includes polioviruses,
coxsackieviruses, echoviruses, and other enteroviruses. Detection
via PCR involves amplification of viral RNA extracted from plasma
samples.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/Acceptable Specimen:
• Plasma collected in EDTA tubes. The specimen should be
processed promptly and stored at -70°C or lower until testing.
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Samples not preserved in EDTA tubes.
• Specimens that have been stored at temperatures higher than
-70°C.
• Hemolyzed, contaminated, or improperly labeled specimens.
4. PROCEDURE
A. RNA Extraction:
1. Thaw plasma samples on ice.
2. Vortex the plasma sample to ensure consistency.
3. Extract viral RNA using a commercially available RNA
extraction kit, following the manufacturer's instructions.
4. Elute the RNA in nuclease-free water and store at -70°C until
PCR setup.
B. PCR Setup:
1. Prepare the PCR master mix according to the protocol provided
by the kit manufacturer, including primers and probes specific
for enterovirus RNA.
2. Aliquot 5 µL of RNA sample into individual PCR wells.
3. Add 15 µL of PCR master mix to each well, ensuring thorough
mixing.
4. Include appropriate controls:
◦ Positive control (enterovirus RNA)
◦ Negative control (nuclease-free water)
◦ Extraction control (RNA from a known negative plasma
specimen)
C. Thermocycling Conditions:
1. Place the PCR plate into the thermocycler.
2. Program the thermocycler with the following conditions:
◦ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 2 minutes
◦ Cycling (40 cycles):
▪ Denaturation: 95°C for 15 seconds
▪ Annealing/Extension: 60°C for 1 minute
D. Post-PCR Analysis:
1. Analyze the PCR results using the appropriate software
provided with the thermocycler.
2. Confirm the presence of enterovirus RNA by evaluating
amplification curves and Ct (Cycle threshold) values.
3. Interpret the results:
◦ Positive: Ct value ≤ 38 (signal present and specific
amplification curve)
◦ Negative: No amplification curve or Ct value > 38 (signal
absence)
◦ Inconclusive: Amplification curve not distinct, re-testing
recommended
5. QUALITY CONTROL
Internal Controls:
• Internal positive and negative controls must show expected
results for the PCR run to be validated.
External Quality Control:
• Participate in external proficiency testing and validation programs
to ensure the accuracy of enterovirus detection by PCR.
Documentation and Reporting Results:
• Record all PCR results, including controls, in the lab's LIS
(Laboratory Information System).
• Review and verify results by a qualified technologist before
transmission to the ordering physician.
6. REFERENCES
Refer to the specific manufacturers' instructions for RNA extraction
and PCR kits used in the procedure.
7. NOTES
• Ensure all equipment (thermocyclers, pipettes, etc.) are calibrated
and validated before use.
• Use proper PPE (Personal Protective Equipment) to avoid
contamination.
• Dispose of biological waste according to biosafety regulations.
By adhering to this SOP, laboratory personnel can ensure the reliable
and accurate detection of enterovirus in plasma samples, contributing
to effective patient diagnosis and care.
