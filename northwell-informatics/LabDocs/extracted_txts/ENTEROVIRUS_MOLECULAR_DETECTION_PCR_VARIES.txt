Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Title: Protocol for the
Analytical Phase of Generating Results for Enterovirus,
Molecular Detection, PCR
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to describe the procedures for the
analytical phase of generating results for Enterovirus using molecular
detection by PCR. The procedures ensure accurate, reliable, and
reproducible test results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory staff, including molecular technologists and
laboratory supervisors, are responsible for adhering to this SOP
during the analytical phase of Enterovirus PCR testing. It is the
responsibility of all staff members to identify and report any
deviations from this procedure and to uphold laboratory quality
standards.
3. EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS
• PCR Instrument (e.g., ABI 7500, Bio-Rad CFX96)
• Real-time PCR thermal cycler
• Microcentrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Pipettes and filtered pipette tips
• DNAse/RNAse-free consumables (tubes, gloves, etc.)
• Enterovirus PCR kit (e.g., CDC Enterovirus RT-PCR Kit,
commercial kits)
• Positive and Negative Control samples
• Nuclease-Free Water
• Biosafety cabinet (BSC) class II for sample preparation
4. SAMPLES
Ensure that the specimens have been properly collected,
transported, and documented prior to analysis.
Acceptable Specimens:
• Throat swabs
• Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
• Stool samples
• Blood samples
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens without proper labeling or missing documentation
• Specimens showing signs of leakage, contamination, or improper
transport conditions
5. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation
1. Perform all sample preparations in a biosafety cabinet to
maintain a contamination-free environment.
2. Thaw samples and controls on ice or in a 4°C refrigerator. Mix
the samples by gently inverting the tubes or using a vortex
mixer at low speed.
3. Aliquot 5-10 μL of each specimen into appropriately labeled 0.2
mL PCR tubes or plates.
4. Include positive and negative controls with every batch of
samples to be tested.
B. Reagent Preparation
1. Thaw PCR reagents (e.g., mastermix, primers, and probes) at
room temperature. Mix by gentle inversion or low-speed
vortexing. Ensure all reagents are briefly centrifuged to collect
contents at the bottom of tubes.
2. Prepare the master mix according to the manufacturer’s
instructions or laboratory-developed protocol. Calculate the
volume required based on the number of reactions (including
controls).
3. Keep prepared master mix on ice until ready for use.
C. PCR Setup
1. Pipette the appropriate volume of master mix into each well of a
PCR plate or PCR tubes.
2. Add 5-10 μL of each sample, control, and Nuclease-Free Water
(for no-template control) to the designated wells containing the
master mix.
3. Seal the PCR plate with an adhesive seal or cap the PCR tubes
tightly.
4. Mix the plate/tubes gently to ensure homogeneity and briefly
centrifuge to collect the contents at the bottom.
D. PCR Amplification
1. Place the PCR plate/tubes into the real-time PCR thermocycler.
2. Input the thermal cycling conditions based on the assay’s
specific protocol. Typical cycling conditions may include:
◦ Reverse Transcription: 50°C for 15 minutes
◦ Initial Denaturation: 95°C for 10 minutes
◦ Amplification (40-45 cycles):
▪ Denaturation: 95°C for 15 seconds
▪ Annealing/Extension: 60°C for 1 minute
3. Ensure proper calibration and naming of each run.
4. Start the amplification process.
E. Data Analysis and Interpretation
1. Once the run is complete, review the amplification curves and
threshold cycle (Ct) values.
2. Compare the Ct values of the samples against the controls.
◦ Positive Control: Must show amplification at the expected Ct
range.
◦ Negative Control (no template): Must show no amplification.
3. Samples are considered positive for Enterovirus if the Ct value
falls within the predefined positive range. A lack of amplification
or a Ct value above the predetermined cut-off indicates a
negative result.
4. Record and document all results, including any outliers or
anomalies.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Ensure that all controls (positive and negative) show expected
results before concluding the assay as valid.
2. Regularly calibrate PCR instruments and maintain records of
maintenance and calibration activities.
3. Perform regular external proficiency testing and internal quality
control to ensure assay consistency and reliability.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Enter all validated results into the Laboratory Information
System (LIS) for review and verification by a technologist.
2. If discrepancies or issues arise, repeat the analysis or perform
further investigations as needed.
3. Communicate critical results immediately to the requesting
physician or healthcare provider according to laboratory policy.

accommodate updates in technology, reagents, or laboratory
protocols.
