Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Enterovirus RNA
Detection by PCR in CSF
1. PURPOSE
This SOP defines the procedure for the detection of Enterovirus RNA
in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) specimens using the polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) technique. This highly sensitive and specific method
allows for the rapid identification of enterovirus infections in patients
exhibiting symptoms of viral meningitis or encephalitis.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel trained in PCR
techniques and is performed in the Molecular Diagnostics
department. It is intended for use only with CSF specimens collected
from patients suspected of having an enterovirus infection.
3. RESPONSIBILITIES
• Laboratory Technologist: Responsible for performing the assay
according to this SOP, maintaining proper documentation, and
ensuring the proper functioning and calibration of equipment.
• Laboratory Supervisor: Responsible for ensuring compliance with
this SOP, overseeing quality control, and addressing any
procedural or technical issues that arise.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• PCR Thermocycler
• Biosafety Cabinet (Class II)
• Vortex mixer
• Microcentrifuge
• Pipettes and sterile filter pipette tips
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
• RNA extraction kit (validated for CSF)
• Enterovirus RNA PCR Kit (validated for clinical diagnostic use)
• RNase-free water
• PCR tubes and reaction plates
• Positive and negative control samples
• Nucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs)
• Taq DNA Polymerase
• Reverse transcriptase
• Primers and probes specific for Enterovirus RNA
• Ice and ice buckets
5. PROCEDURE
5.1 Specimen Preparation
1. Ensure specimen is a CSF sample collected in a sterile
container and labeled with patient identification.
2. Upon receipt, check specimen integrity and volume. Reject any
specimens that are clotted, appear contaminated, or lack
proper labeling.
3. Store CSF samples at 2-8°C if they will be processed within 24
hours. For longer storage, freeze at -80°C.
5.2 RNA Extraction
1. Perform RNA extraction using the designated RNA extraction kit
following the manufacturer's protocol.
2. Include negative extraction controls to monitor for
contamination.
3. Quantify and assess the purity of the extracted RNA using a
spectrophotometer or fluorometer, if applicable.
4. Store extracted RNA on ice during preparation for PCR or at
-80°C if long-term storage is required.
5.3 PCR Setup
1. Thaw all reagents on ice, including RNA samples, primers,
probes, dNTPs, and reverse transcriptase.
2. Prepare the master mix in a sterile, RNase/DNase-free
environment as follows:
◦ RNase-free water: to final volume (usually 25 µL per
reaction)
◦ PCR buffer: as per kit instruction
◦ MgCl2: as recommended
◦ dNTP mix: as recommended
◦ Forward primer: as recommended
◦ Reverse primer: as recommended
◦ Probe: as recommended
◦ Taq DNA Polymerase: as recommended
◦ Reverse Transcriptase: as recommended (for RT-PCR)
3. Mix the master mix thoroughly and aliquot it into PCR tubes or
a reaction plate.
4. Add RNA samples, positive controls, and negative controls to
the tube or plate in a separate area to avoid cross-
contamination.
5.4 Amplification
1. Place PCR tubes or plates into the thermocycler.
2. Program the thermal cycler with the following cycling
conditions:
◦ Reverse transcription: 50°C for 30 minutes
◦ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 10 minutes
◦ 40 cycles of:
▪ Denaturation: 95°C for 15 seconds
▪ Annealing/Extension: 60°C for 1 minute
5.5 Detection and Analysis
1. At the end of the cycling protocol, analyze the PCR products
using the real-time detection system associated with the
thermocycler.
2. Record the threshold cycle (Ct) values for all samples and
controls.
5.6 Interpretation of Results
1. Positive Result: Detection of specific enterovirus RNA is
indicated by a Ct value within the defined positive range. Report
as "Enterovirus RNA detected."
2. Negative Result: Absence of specific enterovirus RNA is
indicated by no detectable Ct value within the defined range.
Report as "Enterovirus RNA not detected."
3. Invalid Result: If controls fail, repeat the assay. Investigate and
resolve any issues before reporting results.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Include positive and negative controls in each run.
2. Monitor for contamination and performance issues.
3. Document all QC results and corrective actions.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Transmit results to the Laboratory Information System (LIS) for
validation by a technologist.
2. Follow site-specific reporting guidelines.
3. Ensure results are available to clinicians promptly.

REVIEW AND REVISION
This SOP will be reviewed annually or as needed based on updates
to technique, equipment, or reagents. Changes must be approved by
the laboratory supervisor.
