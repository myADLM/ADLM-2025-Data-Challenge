Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analysis of Eosinophils in
Random Urine Samples
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized protocol for the analysis and reporting of
eosinophils in random urine samples.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for the analysis and
documentation of results. Supervisors must ensure staff follow the
procedures correctly, including taking corrective actions when
necessary.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/acceptable:
• Randomly collected urine sample, a minimum of 10 mL
Unacceptable:
• Specimens arriving in the laboratory more than 6 hours after
collection if kept at room temperature or more than 24 hours if
refrigerated.
• Specimens without a clearly indicated collection date and time on
the container or requisition.
• Specimens with significant visible contamination (e.g., fecal
matter, large clots of blood).
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Centrifuge
• Microscope with 10x, 40x, and 100x objective lenses
• Hemocytometer (if manual counting is chosen)
• Cell stain (Wright's stain or equivalent)
• Micropipettes
• Urine container with conical bottom
• Glass slides and coverslips
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
1. PROCEDURE
A) Sample Preparation and Staining
1. Aliquot 10 mL of the well-mixed urine sample into a conical
bottom centrifuge tube.
2. Centrifuge the sample at 400-450 g for 5 minutes.
3. Carefully decant the supernatant, leaving approximately 0.5 mL
of urine in the tube without disturbing the sediment.
4. Resuspend sediment in the remaining volume by gently flicking
the tube or using a micropipette.
5. Place one or two drops (approx. 20 µL) of the sediment
suspension on a clean glass slide.
6. Prepare a smear by placing a coverslip over the drop(s),
allowing the liquid to spread evenly.
7. Staining: Gently stain the sediment with Wright's stain or
equivalent according to the stain manufacturer's instructions.
Typically, this involves:
◦ Flooding the smear with stain for 1 minute.
◦ Adding buffer or water and letting it sit for an additional 3-5
minutes.
◦ Rinsing gently with distilled water and allowing the slide to
air dry.
B) Microscopic Examination
1. Examine the stained smear under the microscope at low power
(10x objective) to locate areas with concentrated cells.
2. Switch to a higher power (40x objective) to identify eosinophils
based on their characteristic bilobed nuclei and red-orange
granules in the cytoplasm.
3. For a detailed count, use 100x objective with immersion oil.
4. Count the number of eosinophils in 10 high-power fields (HPF)
and calculate the average.
C) Reporting Results
1. Document the average number of eosinophils per HPF.
2. If the eosinophils exceed the laboratory’s established reference
interval, flag the result as an outlier or abnormal.
3. Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS) for
review and release by a qualified technologist.
Reference Interval:
• Normal Range: 0-1 eosinophils/HPF
1. QUALITY CONTROL
2. Perform quality control procedures using positive controls or
known eosinophil-containing reference samples to ensure
staining and identification accuracy.
3. Document and review quality control results daily.
4. If control results fall outside acceptable limits, troubleshoot and
document corrections before testing patient samples.
5. METHOD LIMITATIONS
6. Ensure accurate identification of eosinophils, distinguishing
them from other leukocytes.
7. Artifacts, contamination, or improper staining can lead to
misidentification and incorrect counts.
