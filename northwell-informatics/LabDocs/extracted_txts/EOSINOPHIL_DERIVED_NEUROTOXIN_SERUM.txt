Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Eosinophil Derived Neurotoxin, Serum
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedures for the analysis
of Eosinophil Derived Neurotoxin (EDN) in serum samples to ensure
accuracy, reliability, and reproducibility of results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
All designated laboratory staff involved in the analysis of EDN are
responsible for adhering to the procedures outlined in this SOP.
Laboratory supervisors are responsible for ensuring compliance with
this SOP and addressing any deficiencies or issues that may arise
during the analysis.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Accepted Specimen:
• 4 mL of serum collected via venipuncture into a red-top tube or
serum separator tube (SST).
• Centrifuge the specimen at 1500-2000 x g for 10 minutes to
separate the serum.
• Specimens must be stored at 2-8°C and are stable for up to 7
days or frozen at -20°C or lower for up to 6 months.
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Specimens that are hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric.
• Specimens with visible clots or that are improperly labeled.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• ELISA Kit for Eosinophil Derived Neurotoxin (EDN)
• Microplate reader with 450 nm wavelength capability
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Plate shaker
• Timer
• Reagent reservoir
• Calibrated control materials
• Distilled water
• Laboratory refrigerator and freezer
5. PROCEDURE
5.1 Preparation of Reagents and Controls
• Allow all reagents and control materials to come to room
temperature (20-25°C) before use.
• Prepare standards and controls according to the manufacturer's
instructions included in the ELISA kit.
5.2 Sample Preparation
• Thaw frozen serum samples at room temperature if applicable.
• Dilute serum samples if required by the kit instructions.
5.3 ELISA Assay Protocol
1. Set up the ELISA plate according to the kit instructions.
2. Pipette standards, controls, and serum samples into designated
wells.
3. Add the appropriate reagents (e.g., conjugate, substrate) as per
the kit instructions.
4. Incubate the plate using a plate shaker as instructed to ensure
proper mixing.
5. Wash the plate wells thoroughly between reagent additions as
specified.
6. Add stop solution to each well when incubation is complete.
7. Read the optical density (OD) of the plate using a microplate
reader set to 450 nm.
5.4 Calculating Results
• Use the standard curve generated from the known concentrations
of EDN standards to calculate the concentration of EDN in serum
samples.
• Ensure all sample OD readings fall within the range of the
standard curve.
5.5 Quality Control
• Run controls with each batch of samples to ensure the accuracy
and precision of the assay.
• Record control values and determine if they fall within acceptable
ranges before reporting patient results.
• Repeat any tests where control values are outside acceptable
ranges.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
• Review and verify calculated EDN concentrations in the
Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Ensure all reported results include reference ranges and units
(ng/mL).
7. REFERENCE RANGES
Refer to kit insert or literature references for established reference
ranges for EDN in serum.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the ELISA kit insert for specific limitations related to the
assay, including cross-reactivity, detection limits, and potential
interferences.

10. REVISION HISTORY
This SOP will be reviewed annually or as needed to incorporate any
updates from the manufacturer or new guidelines from relevant
authorities.
