Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Ephedrine, Serum
1. PURPOSE
To describe the standardized procedure for the quantitative analysis
of ephedrine in serum samples to ensure accuracy and consistency
in test results.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of the laboratory technologists to follow this
SOP for the analysis of ephedrine in serum samples and to ensure
correctness in all procedural steps and documentation. The
supervisor is responsible for the review and validation of the SOP
and for addressing any deviations or issues encountered.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen Type:
• Preferred: Serum from a properly collected and labeled blood
sample.
Specimen Collection:
• Collect blood using standard venipuncture techniques.
• Use a red-top tube or serum separator tube (SST).
• Allow the blood to clot at room temperature for 30 minutes, then
centrifuge for 10 minutes at 1500g to obtain serum.
Specimen Storage:
• Serum separated from cells should be stored at 2-8°C and
analyzed within 48 hours.
• For long-term storage, serum samples should be frozen at -20°C
or lower. Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens with hemolysis, lipemia, or icterus.
• Specimens received in inappropriate containers.
• Specimens that are over 48 hours old (if refrigerated) and not
frozen.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) system
equipped with a UV detector.
• Analytical balance.
• Centrifuge.
• Vortex mixer.
• Refrigerator (2-8°C) and freezer (-20°C or lower).
Reagents:
• Mobile phase (prepared according to method-specific
requirements; e.g., a mixture of acetonitrile and water).
• Calibration standards of ephedrine.
• Internal standard solution (if applicable).
• Quality control (QC) materials.
• Serum sample preparation reagents (e.g., protein precipitation
reagent or solid-phase extraction components).
1. PROCEDURE
A) Sample Preparation:
1. Preparation of Calibration Standards and Quality Controls:
◦ Prepare calibration standards by diluting a separate stock
solution of ephedrine in blank serum to cover the expected
analytical range.
◦ Prepare quality control samples at low, medium, and high
concentrations within the analytical range.
2. Serum Sample Preparation:
◦ Thaw frozen serum samples at room temperature.
◦ Vortex the serum samples for uniformity.
◦ Pipette a specified volume of serum (e.g., 0.5 mL) into a
centrifuge tube.
◦ Add an appropriate volume of internal standard solution (if
applicable) to each sample, calibration standard, and QC
sample.
◦ Add protein precipitation reagent, vortex thoroughly, and
centrifuge the mixture to pellet the precipitate.
◦ Alternatively, follow solid-phase extraction procedures as
per kit instructions.
◦ Transfer the supernatant to an HPLC vial for analysis.
B) HPLC Analysis:
1. System Setup:
◦ Ensure the HPLC system is calibrated and check that the
mobile phase is prepared according to method
specifications.
◦ Equilibrate the HPLC column with the mobile phase until a
stable baseline is achieved.
2. Injection:
◦ Inject a set volume (e.g., 20 µL) of each sample, calibration
standard, and QC into the HPLC system.
◦ Ensure to include blank samples to check for contamination
and carryover.
3. Data Collection:
◦ Run the HPLC analysis under the defined chromatographic
conditions (e.g., flow rate, column temperature, detection
wavelength).
◦ Collect data for each run, ensuring the integration of peaks
corresponding to ephedrine and the internal standard (if
used).
4. Analysis:
◦ Compare the retention times and integrated peak areas of
samples to those of the calibration standards.
◦ Construct a calibration curve from the standards.
◦ Calculate the concentration of ephedrine in each serum
sample using the calibration curve.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
6. Run low, medium, and high QC samples with each analytical
batch to ensure accuracy and precision. The QC results must
fall within predefined accepted limits.
7. Document any out-of-range QC results and take appropriate
corrective measures as per QC protocols.
8. Repeat the analysis for any samples where the internal
standard recovery is outside the acceptable range.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
10. Review and validate the analytical data ensuring all QC criteria
and validation parameters are met.
11. Results are automatically transmitted to the Laboratory
Information System (LIS) and must be reviewed and verified by
the technologist.
12. Any critical results or anomalous findings should be promptly
reported to the responsible clinician or department as per
standard reporting guidelines.
13. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Reference intervals should be established based on the
population being tested or as provided by the literature or method
validation studies.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to the method validation documents and equipment
manuals for specific limitations regarding the detection limits,
potential interferences, and specificity of the assay.
1. DOCUMENTATION AND RECORD KEEPING
• Maintain records of calibration, QC, and patient results as per
laboratory documentation protocols.
• Monitor and record any deviations, issues, or troubleshooting
steps taken during the analytical process.
