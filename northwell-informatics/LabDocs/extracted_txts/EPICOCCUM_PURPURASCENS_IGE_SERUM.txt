Standard Operating Procedure: EPICOCCUM
PURPURASCENS, IGE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
To outline the analytical procedure for the detection and quantification
of specific Immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies to Epicoccum
purpurascens in serum samples using enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay (ELISA) or similar immunoassay techniques.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory staff performing analysis of
Epicoccum purpurascens specific IgE in serum samples within the
laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
All designated laboratory personnel trained in immunoassay
techniques are responsible for performing and documenting the
analysis. It is the responsibility of laboratory supervisors to ensure
that staff adhere to this SOP.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENT
• Type: Serum
• Volume: Minimum 1 mL
• Handling: Serum should be separated from the clot within 2
hours of collection. If analysis is not performed immediately, store
the serum at 2-8°C for up to 7 days. For longer storage, freeze at
-20°C or lower.
• Unacceptable Specimen Types: Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric
samples.
5. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• ELISA reader capable of measuring at 450 nm
• Microplate washer
• Incubator (37°C)
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes and tips (single and multi-channel)
• Reagent kit specific for Epicoccum purpurascens IgE detection
◦ Capture antigen: Epicoccum purpurascens allergen
◦ IgE standards and controls
◦ Enzyme conjugate (anti-human IgE)
◦ Substrate solution (e.g., tetramethylbenzidine, TMB)
◦ Stop solution (e.g., 1 N sulfuric acid)
◦ Wash buffer
◦ Sample diluent
6. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation
1. Reagents and Controls: Bring all reagents, serum samples,
and controls to room temperature (20-25°C) before use.
2. Microplate: Label the microplate strips for standards, controls,
and patient samples.
B. Assay Procedure
1. Designate Wells: Assign wells for standards (in duplicate),
controls, and patient samples.
2. Add Standards and Samples:
◦ Pipette 100 μL of standards, controls, and diluted serum
samples into the designated wells.
◦ Include a blank well with only sample diluent.
3. Incubation:
◦ Incubate the microplate at 37°C for 1 hour.
4. Wash Steps:
◦ Aspirate and wash each well 3-5 times with wash buffer
using the microplate washer.
5. Add Enzyme Conjugate:
◦ Add 100 μL of enzyme conjugate to each well (except the
blank).
◦ Incubate the microplate at 37°C for 30 minutes.
6. Wash Steps:
◦ Aspirate and wash each well 3-5 times with wash buffer.
7. Add Substrate Solution:
◦ Add 100 μL of substrate solution to each well.
◦ Incubate in the dark at room temperature for 15-30 minutes
(until adequate color development).
8. Stop Reaction:
◦ Add 50 μL of stop solution to each well.
C. Reading and Interpretation
1. Read the Plate:
◦ Measure the optical density (OD) at 450 nm using the ELISA
reader within 30 minutes of adding stop solution.
2. Data Analysis:
◦ Generate a standard curve by plotting the OD values of
standards against their known concentrations.
◦ Determine the concentration of Epicoccum purpurascens
specific IgE in patient samples using the standard curve.
D. Quality Control
1. Quality Control Samples:
◦ Run positive and negative control samples with each assay
batch.
◦ Ensure that control values are within the established
acceptable ranges before reporting patient results.
2. Repeat Testing:
◦ If control results are out of range, troubleshoot the assay,
repeat the test, and document corrective actions taken.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results Entry: Enter the quantitative results of Epicoccum
purpurascens IgE into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Interpretation:
◦ Report results in kU/L.
◦ Include reference intervals with the final report.
• Critical Results: Notify the requesting healthcare provider if
results are critically high and may indicate a significant allergic
sensitization.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Interferences: Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples can
interfere with the assay and produce invalid results.
• Cross-reactivity: Cross-reactivity with other allergen-specific
IgEs may occur.
