Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
1. Purpose:
To provide standardized procedures for conducting Epidermal Nerve
Fiber Density (ENFD) analysis in a clinical laboratory setting to
ensure accurate, consistent, and timely results.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing and
documenting all steps in the ENFD analysis procedure as defined in
this SOP. All personnel must ensure that the procedures are strictly
followed and any deviation is promptly reported to a supervisor.
1. Definitions:
Epidermal Nerve Fiber Density (ENFD): A diagnostic test to quantify
the density of nerve fibers in the epidermis, providing vital information
for diagnosing small fiber neuropathy.
1. Procedure:
3.1 Specimen Handling:
• Ensure the specimen received is fixed skin biopsy in paraffin
blocks.
• Verify the specimen identification information matches the
requisition form.
• Record the specimen details in the laboratory information
management system (LIMS).
3.2 Preparation of Tissue Sections:
• Trim paraffin blocks and obtain sections of 50 µm with a
microtome.
• Place sections onto glass slides treated with poly-L-lysine to
enhance adhesion.
• Allocate at least 3 sections per specimen for staining.
3.3 Immunohistochemical Staining:
• Deparaffinize tissue sections by immersing slides in xylene for 10
minutes, repeated twice.
• Rehydrate sections by passing slides through graded alcohol
solutions (100%, 95%, 70%) for 5 minutes each, followed by
deionized water.
• Perform antigen retrieval using citrate buffer (pH 6.0) in a
microwave or pressure cooker.
• Block endogenous peroxidase activity by treating sections with
3% hydrogen peroxide in methanol for 10 minutes.
• Apply blocking solution (5% normal serum) for 1 hour in a
humidified chamber to prevent non-specific binding.
• Incubate sections with primary antibody against protein gene
product 9.5 (PGP 9.5) overnight at 4°C.
• Wash sections with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and
incubate with biotinylated secondary antibody at room
temperature for 30 minutes.
• Rinse and apply avidin-biotin complex (ABC) reagent for 30
minutes.
• Develop color with 3,3'-diaminobenzidine (DAB) substrate.
• Counterstain with hematoxylin, dehydrate, clear, and mount
sections with coverslips.
3.4 Microscopic Analysis:
• Use an appropriate light microscope equipped with a camera to
capture images.
• Count nerve fibers crossing the basement membrane into the
epidermis within a predefined area, avoiding regions with artifacts
or damage.
• Ensure results are analyzed and reviewed by a second qualified
individual for confirmation.
3.5 Data Documentation:
• Document all findings in the LIMS including counts, the total
length of the epidermal region examined, and any anomalies
noted during analysis.
• Interpret results based on established reference ranges and
include comments on any abnormalities identified.
1. Quality Control:
• Include known control samples with each batch of tests to ensure
staining consistency and accuracy of results.
• Check calibration and maintenance logs for all equipment used
during the procedures.
• Review and address any discrepancies identified in quality control
prior to issuing results.
1. Reporting Results:
• Finalize reports including the patient's demographic information,
test results with reference ranges, and any interpretive comments.
• Ensure all results are reviewed and signed by a pathologist before
submission.
• Communicate critical or significantly abnormal results to the
ordering physician immediately.

This protocol will be reviewed and revised on an annual basis or as
required to accommodate updates in laboratory practices or
advancements in related technologies.
