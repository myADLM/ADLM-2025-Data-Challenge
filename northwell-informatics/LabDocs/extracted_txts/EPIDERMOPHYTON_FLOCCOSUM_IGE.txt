Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Analytical Phase - Generating
Results for Epidermophyton floccosum IgE
1. PURPOSE: To ensure accurate and reliable processing and
reporting of Epidermophyton floccosum IgE results from patient
specimens in a CLIA-certified laboratory environment.
Responsibility: • Designated laboratory staff are responsible for
performing and documenting the analytical procedures. • Supervisors
are responsible for overseeing the process and verifying accuracy.
1. DEFINITION: Epidermophyton floccosum IgE is an
immunoglobulin E antibody response to the fungal pathogen
Epidermophyton floccosum, indicative of an allergic response.
2. PROCEDURE: A) Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies:
• ImmunoCAP or equivalent IgE analyzer.
• Epidermophyton floccosum IgE reagent kits.
• Quality Control (QC) materials for IgE.
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE).
• Calibrated pipettes and tips.
• Centrifuge.
• Refrigerator (2-8°C).
• Freezer (-20°C or lower).
• Laboratory bench and appropriate waste disposal containers.
• Laboratory information system (LIS) for result entry and review.
B) Sample Requirements and Preparation:
• Acceptable Specimens: Serum or plasma collected in a gold or
green top tube. Sample should be free of hemolysis, lipemia, and
icterus.
• Specimen Stability: Specimens are stable for up to 7 days
refrigerated (2-8°C) and up to 1 year when frozen (-20°C).
C) Analytical Procedure:
1. Ensure that all equipment is calibrated, and QC checks have
been performed according to the manufacturer's guidelines.
2. Thaw frozen specimens at room temperature. Mix gently by
inversion or using a vortex mixer.
3. Load the reagent kit into the analyzer following manufacturer
instructions. Confirm that all reagents are within their expiration
date.
4. Label and prepare patient specimens and control samples
accordingly.
5. Program the ImmunoCAP analyzer for the Epidermophyton
floccosum IgE assay, referencing the appropriate assay
protocol.
6. Pipette the appropriate volume of patient specimen, calibrators,
and controls as stipulated in the assay instructions.
7. Load the specimens, calibrators, and controls onto the
analyzer.
8. Start the assay run. Monitor the assay to ensure it proceeds
without errors or anomalies.
9. After assay completion, retrieve and review the results from the
analyzer display or printout.
D) Quality Control:
• Run QC samples at the beginning of each assay run, after
maintenance, and whenever reagent lots are changed.
• Document QC results according to site-specific protocols.
• If any QC sample is outside the acceptable range, investigate and
resolve the issue before proceeding with patient specimens.
E) Result Review and Verification:
1. Review all patient results for accuracy and consistency with
expected values.
2. Confirm that negative control results are within the acceptable
range (below the assay cutoff).
3. Verify that quality controls are within predefined limits.
4. Enter results into the LIS for final review by a technologist.
5. Verify and release results to ensure they are reported in
accordance with site-specific protocols and patient
confidentiality is maintained.
F) Reporting Results:
• Report results quantitatively wherever possible.
• Reference Intervals:
◦ Negative: < 0.1 kU/L
◦ Borderline: 0.1 - 0.35 kU/L
◦ Positive: > 0.35 kU/L
• Document any critical or unusual findings promptly and notify the
responsible clinician as per the laboratory's critical values policy.
G) Maintenance and Troubleshooting:
• Perform routine maintenance on the analyzer as specified by the
manufacturer.
• Address any error messages during the run and repeat the assay
if necessary.
• Document maintenance activities and any troubleshooting steps
taken.
1. DOCUMENTATION:
• Record all temperature logs for the storage of reagents and
specimens.
• Complete and maintain QC, maintenance, and troubleshooting
logs.
• Ensure that all patient results and QC data are documented and
reviewed according to the laboratory's policies.
References:
• Manufacturer’s Instructions for Use (IFU) provided with the IgE
analyzer and reagent kits.
• Internal laboratory QC and maintenance protocols.
• CLIA guidelines and standards for laboratory practice.
By following this SOP, laboratory staff will ensure the accurate
detection and reporting of Epidermophyton floccosum IgE, thereby
contributing to the diagnosis and management of patients with
suspected fungal allergies.
