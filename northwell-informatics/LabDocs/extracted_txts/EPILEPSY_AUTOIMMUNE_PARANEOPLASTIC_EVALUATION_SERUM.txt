Standard Operating Procedure: Analytical Phase for Generating
Results of EPILEPSY, AUTOIMMUNE/PARANEOPLASTIC
EVALUATION, SERUM
1. PURPOSE:
The purpose of this procedure is to provide a standardized protocol
for the analytical phase of generating results for the epilepsy,
autoimmune/paraneoplastic evaluation in serum samples. This
ensures consistency, accuracy, and reliability of the test results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY:
It is the responsibility of designated laboratory staff to perform the
analysis and ensure accurate documentation and reporting of the
results. This includes all technologists and supervisors who oversee
the analysis and validate the test results.
3. DEFINITIONS:
Autoimmune/Paraneoplastic Evaluation: Testing for autoantibodies
associated with neurological disorders, including epilepsy, which may
be indicative of autoimmune or paraneoplastic syndromes.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES:
• Centrifuge
• Pipettors and Pipette Tips
• Sample tubes (serum)
• Control materials (positive and negative controls)
• Autoimmune neurology antibody panels (as defined by
manufacturer)
• Automated immunoassay analyzer or ELISA reader (as
applicable)
• Calibrators/Standards (as provided by the test manufacturer)
• Reagents and consumables specific to the test kits used
5. PROCEDURE:
A. Specimen Preparation:
1. Specimen Acceptance and Preparation:
◦ Ensure serum samples are properly labeled and have
undergone initial sample processing.
◦ Centrifuge serum samples for 10 minutes at 1500 RCF
(Relative Centrifugal Force) to separate serum from cells, if
not already done.
2. Specimen Storage:
◦ Store serum samples at 2-8°C if analysis is to be performed
within 48 hours.
◦ For longer storage, freeze serum samples at -20°C or lower.
B. Test Preparation:
1. Reagent Preparation:
◦ Prepare reagents, calibrators, and controls according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Allow all reagents and serum samples to reach room
temperature before use.
2. Calibration:
◦ Perform calibration using the provided calibrators as per the
manufacturer’s protocol.
◦ Document the calibration results.
3. Quality Control:
◦ Run positive and negative control materials at the start of
each run.
◦ Document and review the control results to ensure they fall
within the acceptable range.
◦ If controls are out of range, troubleshoot according to the
laboratory’s quality control policy before proceeding with
patient samples.
C. Analytical Testing:
1. Assay Procedure:
◦ Pipette a specific volume of serum, standards, and controls
into designated wells or tubes as per the test method’s
instructions.
◦ Follow the incubation, washing, and measurement steps
according to the test kit instructions.
2. Reading and Interpretation:
◦ For automated analyzers: Run samples on the instrument
and ensure it is correctly set up for the specific assay.
◦ For manual methods (e.g., ELISA): Measure absorbance
values using an automated plate reader and calculate
results using the provided software or manual calculation
methods given in the kit instructions.
D. Result Validation and Documentation:
1. Result Calculation and Interpretation:
◦ Validate results by ensuring that the standard curve and
control values are acceptable.
◦ Interpret the antibody levels (e.g., positive or negative)
according to the test kit’s reference ranges and criteria.
2. Documentation:
◦ Record all results in the laboratory information system (LIS).
◦ Include patient ID, assay type, date, time, and initials of the
technologist performing the test.
3. Review:
◦ A designated supervisor or a qualified technologist shall
review and verify the test results.
◦ Discrepancies or unusual findings should be noted and
further investigated.
E. Reporting:
1. Result Reporting:
◦ Once results are verified, generate a report in the LIS.
◦ Report should include the patient's details, test results,
reference ranges, and interpretive comments if applicable.
2. Critical Results:
◦ Immediately notify the ordering physician of any critical
results as per laboratory protocol.
F. Quality Assurance:
1. Proficiency Testing:
◦ Participate in relevant proficiency testing programs to
ensure continuous accuracy and reliability of the test
process.
2. Continuous Improvement:
◦ Routinely evaluate and update procedures as necessary to
incorporate new best practices and standards.
