STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase Procedure for Generating Results for Epilepsy,
Autoimmune/Paraneoplastic Evaluation, Spinal Fluid
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedures for the analytical phase of testing spinal
fluid (CSF) for the evaluation of epilepsy, autoimmune disorders, and
paraneoplastic syndromes. This SOP ensures accurate, reliable, and
consistent results are generated.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for following this SOP
and accurately documenting all procedures and results. Supervisors
are responsible for ensuring staff compliance and addressing any
deficiencies.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Preferred Specimen:
• CSF collected via lumbar puncture.
• Ensure prompt delivery to the laboratory within 1 hour of
collection to maintain specimen integrity.
Acceptable Specimen:
• CSF stored at 2-8°C for up to 24 hours.
Unacceptable Specimen:
• CSF specimens arriving at the laboratory more than 24 hours
post-collection.
• CSF specimens collected in inappropriate containers or tubes.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Analytical Instruments: CSF analyzers, immunoassay analyzers,
and molecular biology equipment.
• Reagents: Specific kits for epilepsy-related markers, autoimmune
panel, and paraneoplastic markers.
• Supplies: Pipettes, centrifuge tubes, sterile containers.
1. PROCEDURE
A. PREPARATION
1. Receive and verify the specimen:
◦ Ensure proper labeling with patient's information, date, and
time of collection.
◦ Check for specimen integrity and storage conditions.
2. Documentation:
◦ Record specimen details in the laboratory information
system.
B. ANALYSIS
1. Epilepsy-Related Markers:
◦ Perform analysis according to manufacturer’s instructions
pertaining to epilepsy-related markers (e.g., neuron-specific
enolase, glial fibrillary acidic protein).
◦ Document results in the laboratory information system.
2. Autoimmune Evaluation:
◦ Perform antibody detection tests such as anti-GAD65, anti-
LGI1, anti-NMDAR, following manufacturer’s guidelines.
◦ Document results in the laboratory information system.
3. Paraneoplastic Syndromes Evaluation:
◦ Carry out testing for paraneoplastic markers such as anti-
Hu, anti-Yo, anti-Ri antibodies, using relevant kits.
◦ Document results in the laboratory information system.
4. Quality Control:
◦ Run appropriate quality control samples according to lab
specific protocols to ensure the reliability of test results.
◦ Record QC results and follow up on any deviations from
acceptable ranges.
5. Troubleshooting:
◦ If results are outside expected ranges or if QC fails, review
procedure steps and instrument functionality.
◦ Notify supervisor and perform necessary corrective actions.
C. VALIDATION AND REPORTING
1. Validation of Results:
◦ Review and validate test results by comparing them against
established reference intervals and patient history.
◦ Ensure results are within acceptable limits and all QC
checks pass before validating.
2. Reporting Results:
◦ Enter validated results into the laboratory information
system.
◦ Ensure proper documentation of findings and critical values.
◦ Communicate any critical results to the clinician according to
lab-specific guidelines.
D. STORAGE AND MAINTENANCE
1. Specimen Storage:
◦ Store remaining specimens at 2-8°C for potential retesting
or revalidation, according to lab policy.
2. Data Logging:
◦ Maintain records of all test results, QC checks, and any
deviations encountered.
3. Equipment Maintenance:
◦ Ensure regular maintenance and calibration of analytical
instruments following manufacturers' instructions.
◦ Document maintenance activities.
4. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions and inserts for relevant test kits.
• Laboratory Quality Management protocols.
• Current clinical guidelines for epilepsy and autoimmune/
paraneoplastic syndrome evaluation in CSF.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
Quality control checks should include:
• Daily control tests for instruments and reagents.
• Bi-weekly intralab comparison tests using pooled CSF samples.
• Monthly correlations with external controls.
