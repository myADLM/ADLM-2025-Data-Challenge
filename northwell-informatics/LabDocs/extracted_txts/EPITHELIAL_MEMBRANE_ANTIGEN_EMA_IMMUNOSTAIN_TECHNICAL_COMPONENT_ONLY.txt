Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Generating Results for
Epithelial Membrane Antigen (EMA) Immunostain, Technical
Component Only
1. PURPOSE
To define the protocol for performing the technical component of
Epithelial Membrane Antigen (EMA) immunostaining in a CLIA-
certified laboratory.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all designated laboratory personnel trained
to perform EMA immunostaining in the immunohistochemistry lab.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all designated and trained laboratory
personnel to follow this procedure when performing EMA
immunostaining. The supervising technologist is responsible for
ensuring adherence to this SOP, providing necessary training, and
troubleshooting any issues in the staining process.
4. SPECIMEN
• Type: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue sections.
• Thickness: 3–5 microns
5. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES

• Secondary antibody
• Detection system (e.g., HRP or Alkaline Phosphatase)
• Chromogen (e.g., DAB, Fast Red)
• Counterstain (e.g., Hematoxylin)
• Xylene
• Ethanol (100%, 95%, and 70%)
• PBS or TBS buffer
• Mounting media
• Glass slides and coverslips
• Hydrated chamber (for incubations)
6. EQUIPMENT
• Microtome
• Water bath
• Slide warmer
• Incubator
• Autostainer (if available)
• Light microscope
• Fume hood
7. PROCEDURE
A. Slide Preparation
1. Sectioning:
◦ Cut FFPE tissue sections at 3-5 microns using a microtome.
◦ Float sections on a water bath set to an optimal
temperature.
◦ Collect sections onto charged glass slides.
2. Drying:
◦ Place slides on a slide warmer at 55-60°C for 30 minutes to
ensure proper adhesion of sections.
B. Deparaffinization and Rehydration
1. Deparaffination:
◦ Immerse slides in xylene for 5 minutes, two changes.
2. Rehydration:
◦ Sequentially immerse slides in 100% ethanol for 2 minutes,
two changes.
◦ Continue immersing in 95% ethanol for 2 minutes.
◦ Immerse in 70% ethanol for 2 minutes.
◦ Rinse in distilled water for 2 minutes.
C. Antigen Retrieval
1. Buffer:
◦ Prepare an appropriate antigen retrieval buffer (e.g., citrate
buffer, pH 6.0).
2. Heat Induced Epitope Retrieval (HIER):
◦ Heat slides in a microwave, pressure cooker, or steamer
containing antigen retrieval buffer for 20 minutes.
◦ Allow slides to cool in the buffer for 20 minutes at room
temperature.
3. Rinsing:
◦ Wash slides in PBS or TBS buffer for 5 minutes, two
changes.
D. Immunostaining
1. Blocking:
◦ Apply a protein block (e.g., BSA solution) to slides and
incubate for 10 minutes to reduce non-specific binding.
◦ Tap off the excess blocker.
2. Primary Antibody:
◦ Apply diluted EMA primary antibody to cover the tissue
sections.
◦ Incubate in a humidified chamber for 1 hour at room
temperature.
3. Washing:
◦ Wash slides in PBS or TBS buffer for 5 minutes, three
changes.
4. Secondary Antibody:
◦ Apply the secondary antibody and incubate for 30 minutes
at room temperature.
◦ Wash slides in PBS or TBS buffer for 5 minutes, three
changes.
5. Detection System:
◦ Apply the appropriate detection system reagent (e.g., HRP-
conjugated polymer) and incubate for 30 minutes.
◦ Wash slides in PBS or TBS buffer for 5 minutes, three
changes.
6. Chromogen Development:
◦ Apply chromogen solution (e.g., DAB) to slides and incubate
until optimal staining is observed (2-10 minutes).
◦ Rinse slides in distilled water.
7. Counterstaining:
◦ Apply hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes to counterstain the
nucleus.
◦ Dip slides in tap water to blue the hematoxylin.
◦ Rinse in distilled water.
8. Dehydration and Clearing:
◦ Dehydrate through graded ethanol series (70%, 95%,
100%) and clear in xylene (2 times for 5 minutes).
9. Mounting:
◦ Apply mounting medium and coverslip.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include a positive control (known EMA-positive tissue) and a
negative control (omit primary antibody) with each staining run.
• Document reagent lot numbers, expiration dates, and QC results
in the staining log.
9. RESULT INTERPRETATION AND REPORTING
• Stained slides will be reviewed by a pathologist or designated
professional.
• The pathologist’s interpretation will be recorded and reported as
per laboratory protocol.
10. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If non-specific staining occurs, review blocking steps and antibody
dilutions.
• Optimize antigen retrieval conditions if antigen detection is weak.
• Verify reagent and antibody integrity if expected staining patterns
are not observed.
11. DOCUMENTATION
• Record all relevant details of the staining process, including
reagent lots, incubation times, and QC outcomes.
• Maintain documentation for future reference and compliance with
regulatory requirements.

• Manufacturer’s instructions for primary and secondary antibodies.
• Standard immunohistochemistry texts and protocols.
This protocol is intended to ensure reproducibility and accuracy in
EMA immunostaining, providing consistent and reliable results. All
personnel must adhere strictly to these guidelines to maintain the
high standards expected in a CLIA-certified laboratory.
