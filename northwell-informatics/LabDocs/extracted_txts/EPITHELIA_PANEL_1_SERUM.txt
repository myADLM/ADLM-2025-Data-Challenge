STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE
Title: Analytical Phase Protocol for EPITHELIA PANEL #1, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to ensure reliable, accurate, and
consistent processing of the EPITHELIA PANEL #1 using serum
specimens. This document outlines the procedures, responsibilities,
equipment, and quality control measures required to generate and
report test results.
Responsibility: All laboratory personnel working in the analytical
phase are responsible for following this SOP. Supervisors are
responsible for ensuring that the SOP is adhered to and for
addressing any issues arising from the testing process.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type: Serum Volume: Minimum 2 mL Collection
Instructions:
• Collect blood in a serum separator tube (SST).
• Allow the blood to clot for 30 minutes at room temperature.
• Centrifuge the tube at 1500-2000 x g for 10 minutes to separate
the serum.
• Transfer the serum to a clean tube if necessary.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• EPITHELIA PANEL #1 Reagents Kit
• Calibrators and Controls
• Automated Analyzer
• Pipettes and Pipette Tips
• Serum Separator Tubes (SST)
• Centrifuge
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
• Disposable gloves and lab coat
1. PROCEDURE
A. PREPARATION:
1. Check and record the temperature of the refrigerator, freezer,
and other required equipment.
2. Retrieve the EPITHELIA PANEL #1 reagents and allow them to
reach room temperature.
3. Ensure the integrity and expiration dates of all reagents and
materials to be used.
B. CALIBRATION:
1. Perform calibration on the automated analyzer as per the
manufacturer’s instructions using the calibrators provided in the
reagent kit.
2. Record the calibration values and verify acceptance criteria
before proceeding with sample analysis.
C. QUALITY CONTROL:
1. Run the quality controls (low, medium, and high) in accordance
with the laboratory’s quality control plan and the manufacturer’s
instructions.
2. Validate control results before sample testing. If the controls are
out of range, investigate and rectify the issue before
proceeding.
D. ANALYSIS:
1. Load the patient serum samples and quality controls onto the
automated analyzer.
2. Program the analyzer with the specific assay details for the
EPITHELIA PANEL #1.
3. Initiate the run and ensure that the analyzer operates without
any errors.
4. Monitor the run periodically to ensure smooth operation and
intervene if necessary.
E. RESULT REVIEW:
1. Upon completion of the run, review the results generated by the
analyzer.
2. Confirm the assay validation criteria (e.g., quality control within
specified ranges, calibration correct).
3. Investigate any flagged results or operational issues.
4. REPORTING RESULTS
5. Transfer results from the analyzer to the laboratory information
system (LIS).
6. Review the results for accuracy and consistency.
7. Validate and verify results ensuring all quality control criteria are
met.
8. Release results for reporting in accordance with laboratory
guidelines.
9. QUALITY CONTROL
10. Follow both intralab and interlab quality control procedures:
◦ Regularly participate in proficiency testing.
◦ Document and review all quality control activities and take
corrective actions if required.
11. Review control charts and trends to monitor performance over
time.
12. Maintain detailed records of all calibration, quality control, and
maintenance activities.
13. MAINTENANCE AND TROUBLESHOOTING
14. Follow the manufacturer’s guidelines for routine maintenance of
the analyzer.
15. Perform daily checks and preventive maintenance as
scheduled.
16. Record all maintenance activities in the equipment log.
17. Troubleshoot any issues as per the manufacturer’s instructions
and document all troubleshooting steps taken.
