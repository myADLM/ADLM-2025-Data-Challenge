EPITHELIA PANEL #2, SERUM Protocol for the Analytical Phase
of Generating Results
1. Purpose
The purpose of this protocol is to outline the procedures and
responsibilities involved in generating accurate and reliable results
for the EPITHELIA PANEL #2 assays in serum samples.
1. Specimen Requirements and Stability
Specimen Type: Serum
• Preferred Specimen: Serum collected in a serum separator tube
(SST)
• Volume Required: Minimum 1 mL serum
• Stability: Serum samples must be analyzed within 48 hours of
collection. If not processed within this timeframe, specimens
should be stored at -20°C and must be analyzed within 3 months.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens with signs of gross hemolysis
• Specimens not adequately labeled with patient identification
• Specimens containing anticoagulants other than expected SST or
plain serum tubes
• Specimens not matching the required volume
1. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies
Equipment:
• Automated Immunoassay Analyzer (IA-1000 or equivalent)
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes
Reagents:
• EPITHELIA PANEL #2 reagent kit
• Quality control materials (low, normal, and high control levels)
• Sample diluent and wash solutions
Supplies:
• SST serum collection tubes
• Pipette tips
• Gloves and lab coats
• Sample tubes and racks
1. Preparation for Analysis
Reagent Preparation:
• Follow the manufacturer instructions for preparation and setup of
the EPITHELIA PANEL #2 reagent kit.
• Ensure all reagents are within their expiry dates and stored
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Equipment Calibration and Maintenance:
• Ensure that the automated immunoassay analyzer has undergone
routine maintenance and calibration as per manufacturer
instructions.
• Validate analyzer performance using internal quality control
standards.
1. Procedure
Specimen Handling:
• Centrifuge SST serum collection tubes at 2000 RPM for 10
minutes.
• Carefully aliquot the serum into appropriately labeled sample
tubes.
Assay Setup:
• Load the serum samples into the automated immunoassay
analyzer.
• Program the analyzer with pertinent patient information and assay
parameters (refer to EPITHELIA PANEL #2 setup guide).
Assay Execution:
• Ensure all serum samples, reagents, and controls are properly
placed in the analyzer.
• Run the EPITHELIA PANEL #2 on the analyzer, following
manufacturer’s instructions.
Result Documentation:
• Document the time of analysis, operator initials, and any
deviations or observations.
• Validate results against internal quality control data.
1. Quality Control
Internal Control:
• Run low, normal, and high quality control samples before patient
samples.
• Results must fall within the established ranges before
commencing with patient sample analysis.
External Calibration Verification:
• Perform calibration verification checks after every reagent lot
change or at regular intervals (monthly).
Troubleshooting:
• If quality control results fall outside acceptable limits, investigate
potential issues with reagents, equipment, or sample handling
before proceeding with patient samples.
1. Reporting Results
Result Review and Verification:
• Review all generated data for accuracy and completeness.
• Compare patient results with standard reference ranges.
Critical Results Management:
• Flag and report any critical results to the relevant clinical
personnel immediately according to laboratory policy.
• Document the communication of critical results.
1. Method Limitations
Refer to the EPITHELIA PANEL #2 reagent kit insert for individual
assay limitations and interfering substances.
