Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Epstein-Barr Virus
(EBV) Antibody Panel, Serum
1. PURPOSE
To provide accurate and timely detection of Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV)
antibodies in serum using a validated enzyme immunoassay method.
This protocol outlines the steps required to assay the presence of
various EBV antibodies and ensure the integrity of the results
reported.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all clinical laboratory personnel responsible for
performing EBV antibody testing, including interpretation and
reporting of results.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the trained laboratory technologist to follow
this SOP as outlined and maintain the integrity of specimens and
reagents. The laboratory supervisor must ensure compliance with this
protocol and address any issues that arise during the analytical
phase.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• Automated Immunoassay analyzer (e.g., LIAISON XL, Cobas
e411, or other suitable equipment)
• EBV Antibody Test kit including:
◦ EBV VCA IgM
◦ EBV VCA IgG
◦ EBV EBNA IgG
• Calibration materials and quality control sera
• Micropipettes and tips
• Centrifuge
• Calibrated timer
• Computer with Laboratory Information System (LIS) access
5. SPECIMEN COLLECTION AND PREPARATION
• Collect blood specimen in a serum separator tube (SST).
• Allow the blood to clot for 30 minutes before centrifugation.
• Centrifuge the specimen at 1500-2000 x g for 10 minutes.
• Transfer serum to a clean, labeled tube if not assaying
immediately.
• Store at 2-8°C if testing within 48 hours or freeze at -20°C or
lower for longer storage.
6. PROCEDURE
A. Equipment Preparation
• Ensure that the Immunoassay analyzer is correctly set up and
calibrated according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
• Perform daily maintenance and QC checks as per equipment
guidelines.
B. Reagent Preparation
• Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for preparation of EBV
assay reagents.
• Bring all reagents to room temperature before use.
C. Calibration and Quality Control
• Perform calibration using the provided calibrators according to the
kit instructions.
• Run internal quality controls at low, medium, and high levels
before patient samples.
D. Assay Procedure
1. Label the sample cups/tubes and arrange them in the racks as
per the analyzer’s instructions.
2. Load the samples onto the Immunoassay analyzer.
3. Follow the equipment instructions to initiate the assay for EBV
VCA IgM, VCA IgG, and EBNA IgG.
4. Record the times of each step if manual intervention is
required.
5. Allow the machine to complete the assay and generate results.
E. Post-Assay Review
1. Check that all control results are within acceptable ranges
before reporting patient results.
2. In the case of QC failure, troubleshoot the issue, recalibrate if
necessary, and rerun affected samples.
7. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
• EBV VCA IgM: Positive indicates acute or recent EBV infection.
• EBV VCA IgG: Positive indicates past infection or immunity.
• EBV EBNA IgG: Positive indicates past EBV infection and
immunity.
Interpretation should be combined with clinical findings.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Review results in the LIS.
• Enter findings into the patient’s electronic medical record (EMR)
system.
• Any critical values must be verified and reported to the clinician
immediately.
9. QUALITY CONTROL
• Document all quality control data in the QC log and review
regularly.
• Any deviation from expected results should be documented,
investigated, and corrective actions implemented.
10. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples may interfere with assay
results.
• Results should be interpreted in context with clinical and other
diagnostic findings.
11. REFERENCES
• Refer to the manufacturer’s user manual and product inserts for
detailed information.
• CDC Guidelines for the laboratory diagnosis of EBV infection.
12. RECORDS AND DOCUMENTATION
• Maintain records of specimens, results, QC logs, calibration data,
and any issues encountered during the analytical process.
