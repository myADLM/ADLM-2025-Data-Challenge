STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP) Title: Analytical
Phase of Generating Results for Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) Antibody
Profile, Serum
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for the analysis and generation of results for
the Epstein-Barr Virus Antibody Profile in serum to ensure reliable
and accurate test results.
1. SCOPE
This SOP applies to laboratory personnel performing EBV antibody
testing on serum samples in the laboratory.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
• It is the responsibility of trained laboratory personnel to adhere to
this SOP.
• The laboratory supervisor is responsible for ensuring staff
compliance with this SOP and for addressing any issues identified
during testing.
1. DEFINITIONS
The EBV antibody profile typically includes tests for detecting EBV
viral capsid antigen (VCA) IgM, EBV VCA IgG, and EBV nuclear
antigen (EBNA).
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• ELISA reader with appropriate software
• Microplate washer
• Incubator
• Pipettes and tips (adjustable and fixed volume)
• Serological pipettes
• Microcentrifuge
• Test tubes or microcentrifuge tubes
• Vortex mixer
• EBV Antibody Profile ELISA Kit (includes reagents, controls, and
calibrators)
• Deionized or distilled water
• Disposable gloves and PPE
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND HANDLING
• Specimen: 5 mL of serum collected in a red-top tube or serum
separator tube.
• Storage: Store serum samples at 2-8°C for up to 72 hours. For
long-term storage, freeze at -20°C or lower.
• Ensure specimens are free from hemolysis and gross lipemia.
1. PROCEDURE
7.1 Calibration and Quality Control
• Perform calibration according to the manufacturer’s instructions
prior to running patient samples.
• Run quality control (QC) samples (negative, low positive, and high
positive) with each batch of patient samples to ensure assay
performance is within acceptable limits. Document QC results.
7.2 Sample Preparation
1. Allow serum samples, controls, and kit reagents to reach room
temperature before starting.
2. Label microcentrifuge tubes or test tubes appropriately.
7.3 Assay Procedure (Follow manufacturer's ELISA kit instructions)
1. Prepare reagents and microplate as per the kit instructions.
2. Add patient serum samples, calibrators, and controls to
designated wells.
3. Incubate the plate at the specified temperature and time.
4. Wash the microplate according to the kit instructions using the
microplate washer.
5. Add enzyme conjugate to each well, and incubate.
6. Wash the microplate again.
7. Add substrate solution and incubate for the specified time to
allow color development.
8. Add stop solution to each well to halt the reaction.
9. Read the absorbance at the specified wavelength using the
ELISA reader.
7.4 Result Calculation and Interpretation
1. Calculate the results for each patient sample, control, and
calibrator based on the absorbance readings.
2. Interpret the results according to the manufacturer's guidelines.
Typically:
◦ VCA IgM and IgG positive indicates acute or recent
infection.
◦ VCA IgG positive and EBNA positive indicates past
infection.
◦ VCA IgM negative, VCA IgG negative, and EBNA negative
indicates no previous exposure.
3. REPORTING RESULTS
• Verify and validate all results in accordance with laboratory
protocol.
• Report results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Ensure critical results are communicated to the requesting
physician promptly.
1. QUALITY CONTROL AND TROUBLESHOOTING
• Document any deviations from the procedure and any corrective
actions taken.
• Repeat assay if QC results are outside acceptable limits.
• Refer to the manufacturer's instructions for any troubleshooting
guidance.
1. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS
• Follow standard biosafety guidelines.
• Wear appropriate PPE.
• Handle all specimens and reagents according to the laboratory’s
safety protocols.
• Dispose of biohazard waste in accordance with federal, state, and
local regulations.
