STANDARD OPERATING
PROCEDURE (SOP)
Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) DNA Detection and Quantification,
Plasma
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the process for the detection and quantification of
Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) DNA in plasma using real-time Polymerase
Chain Reaction (PCR). The aim is to provide accurate and timely
results for clinical diagnosis and management.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
All laboratory personnel conducting EBV DNA testing and analysis
are responsible for adhering to this procedure. The supervising
technologist ensures that all personnel understand and follow the
protocol correctly.
3. DEFINITIONS
EBV: Epstein-Barr Virus
PCR: Polymerase Chain Reaction
SOP: Standard Operating Procedure
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred specimen: Plasma collected in EDTA or ACD tubes.
Specimen volume: A minimum of 1 mL plasma is preferred for
processing.
Handling and storage:
• Centrifuge the sample for 10 minutes at 1500-2000g to separate
plasma from cells.
• Carefully aliquot the plasma into a clean, sterile tube without
disturbing the buffy coat.
• Store the specimen at 2-8°C if processed within 24 hours;
otherwise, store frozen at -20°C or lower.
5. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Real-time PCR Instrument
• DNA extraction kits (validated for use with plasma)
• EBV-specific primers and probes
• Nuclease-free water
• PCR master mix
• Positive and negative control samples
• Calibrators and standard curve materials
• Micropipettes and sterile pipette tips
• Vortex mixer
• Centrifuge
6. PROCEDURE
A. DNA Extraction
1. Thaw frozen plasma specimens at room temperature.
2. Vortex each specimen briefly to ensure homogeneity.
3. Centrifuge the samples again at 1500-2000g for 10 minutes to
remove any particulate matter.
4. Follow the manufacturer’s protocol for the DNA extraction kit to
isolate viral DNA from plasma. Ensure that all controls (positive,
negative, and extraction controls) are included.
5. Quantify extracted DNA using a spectrophotometer or other
validated method.
B. PCR Setup
1. Prepare a master mix according to the manufacturer’s
instructions including primers, probes, the required volume of
PCR master mix, and DNA-free water.
2. Aliquot the master mix into PCR tubes or a PCR plate.
3. Add extracted DNA, positive controls, negative controls, and
calibrators to the corresponding tubes or wells.
4. Seal the PCR tubes or plate.
C. PCR Amplification
1. Load the PCR tubes or plate into the real-time PCR instrument.
2. Program the PCR instrument with the cycling conditions
specific for EBV DNA detection and quantification:
◦ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 10 minutes
◦ Amplification (40-45 cycles):
▪ Denaturation: 95°C for 15-30 seconds
▪ Annealing/extension: 60°C for 1 minute (data collection
step)
3. Run the PCR program.
D. Data Analysis
1. Analyze the PCR results using the software provided with the
real-time PCR instrument.
2. Generate a standard curve using the calibrator data.
3. Calculate the concentration of EBV DNA in each sample using
the generated standard curve.
4. Ensure that all controls meet the predefined acceptance
criteria. If any control fails, the run should be invalidated, and
the test should be repeated.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
Include both positive and negative control samples in each PCR run
to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the test.
• Positive control: Confirm amplification and quantify EBV DNA
against expected values.
• Negative control: Confirm the absence of amplification to rule out
contamination.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results are auto-generated by the PRC software and must be
reviewed and verified by a technologist. Report the EBV DNA
concentration in IU/mL or copies/mL as determined.
• If results fall outside of the lower or upper detection limits,
annotate as <LOD (Limit of Detection) or >UD (Upper Detection)
accordingly.
• Provide any comments or recommendations based on the test
outcomes.
• Ensure timely communication of results to healthcare providers
according to laboratory policy and guidelines.
9. TROUBLESHOOTING
If issues arise during the procedure:
• Verify the integrity and storage conditions of reagents and
samples.
• Confirm all equipment is functioning properly and calibrated.
• Re-extract DNA if necessary, or re-run the PCR using new
reagents.
