Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Epstein-Barr Virus Early Antigen (EBV EA),
IgG, Serum
1. PURPOSE
This SOP provides a detailed protocol for the analytical phase of
generating results for Epstein-Barr Virus Early Antigen (EBV EA), IgG
in serum specimens. It outlines the responsibilities, procedures, and
quality control measures to ensure accurate and reliable test results.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the EBV
EA, IgG analysis according to this procedure. Supervisors are
responsible for ensuring adherence to this SOP and addressing any
issues that arise during the analytical process.
1. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all serum specimens submitted for the detection
and quantification of Epstein-Barr Virus Early Antigen, IgG.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Acceptable Specimens:
• Serum collected in SST (serum separator tube)
• Serum collected in a red-top tube
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens collected in tubes with anticoagulants (e.g., EDTA,
heparin)
• Specimens received in hemolyzed, contaminated, or clearly
compromised condition
Specimen Stability:
• Specimens must be refrigerated at 2-8°C if not processed
immediately.
• Serum can be stored for up to 48 hours at 2-8°C.
• For long-term storage, specimens must be frozen at -20°C or
lower.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Microplate reader capable of reading absorbance at 450 nm
• Precision pipettes and tips
• Calibrated centrifuge
Reagents and Supplies:
• EBV EA, IgG ELISA kit (including standards, controls, conjugate,
substrate, and wash buffer)
• Calibrated volumetric flasks
• Sample diluent (as specified by the kit manufacturer)
• Deionized or distilled water
• Disposable gloves
1. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
• Bring all reagents and specimens to room temperature (20-25°C)
before use.
• Review the manufacturer’s instructions for the EBV EA IgG ELISA
kit being used.
• Ensure all equipment is calibrated and operating correctly.
Sample and Reagent Preparation:
• Prepare standards, controls, and samples according to the
manufacturer's protocol.
• Label all samples, standards, and controls to ensure proper
identification throughout the analysis.
Assay Procedure:
1. Add the required volume of sample or standard to the
designated wells as specified in the kit insert.
2. Add the enzyme conjugate to each well.
3. Cover the microplate and incubate at room temperature for the
time specified in the kit insert.
4. Wash the plate to remove unbound conjugate using the
specified wash buffer.
5. Add the substrate solution to each well and incubate at room
temperature for the time specified.
6. Add the stop solution to each well to terminate the reaction.
7. Read the plate at 450 nm using a microplate reader.
Interpretation of Results:
• Use the standard curve generated from the known standards to
quantify the EBV EA IgG concentration in each sample.
• Ensure controls fall within the acceptable range specified by the
kit insert before validating sample results.
Quality Control:
• Run both positive and negative controls with each batch of
samples to ensure assay accuracy.
• If controls are out of range, do not report patient results.
Investigate and resolve the issue before repeating the assay.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
Review:
• Verify all results and ensure controls are within the acceptable
range.
• Document any deviations, troubleshooting actions, or observed
anomalies.
Verification:
• Enter patient results into the LIS (Laboratory Information System).
• Annotate any critical values and inform the attending physician
according to standard reporting protocols.
Reference Intervals:
• Refer to the ELISA kit's insert for specific reference intervals and
interpretative criteria for EBV EA IgG.
Method Limitations:
• Refer to the ELISA kit insert for information on any limitations
associated with the assay, including potential cross-reactivity and
interference.
