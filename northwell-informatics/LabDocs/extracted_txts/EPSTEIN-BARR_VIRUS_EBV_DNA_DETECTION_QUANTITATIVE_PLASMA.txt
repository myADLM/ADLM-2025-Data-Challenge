Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for EPSTEIN-BARR VIRUS
(EBV) DNA DETECTION (QUANTITATIVE), PLASMA
1. PURPOSE To outline the procedures for the detection and
quantification of Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) DNA in plasma
specimens using a quantitative real-time PCR assay. This
protocol aims to ensure accurate, reliable, and consistent
results.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for
adhering to this SOP during the analytical phase. It is essential for all
staff to ensure that the procedures are strictly followed, properly
documented, and any issues or anomalies reported to the supervisor.
1. DEFINITIONS EBV DNA Quantitative PCR: A molecular
technique used to detect and quantify Epstein-Barr Virus DNA
in plasma specimens.
2. SPECIMENS A. Preferred/acceptable: - Plasma separated from
whole blood collected in EDTA tubes. The specimen should be
transported to the laboratory within 24 hours of collection and
be kept at 2-8°C if testing is delayed.
B. Unacceptable: - Non-EDTA plasma samples. - Specimens
received in the laboratory more than 24 hours after collection
unless properly frozen at -20° C or colder. - Specimens with
visible hemolysis or lipemia. - Specimens without proper
identification or collection details.
Specimen Handling: - Upon receipt, plasma should be promptly
separated from whole blood by centrifugation at 1500 x g for 10-15
minutes. - The separated plasma should be transferred into sterile,
labelled microcentrifuge tubes and stored at -20°C or colder until
analysis.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
◦ Real-Time PCR Instrument (e.g., ABI 7500, Roche
LightCycler)
◦ DNA Extraction Kit (e.g., QIAamp DNA Mini Kit)
◦ Quantitative EBV DNA PCR Kit with primers and probes
specific for EBV (e.g., Roche, Qiagen)
◦ Thermal cycler and associated consumables
◦ Microcentrifuge
◦ Vortex mixer
◦ Sterile pipette tips, tubes, and reservoirs
◦ Appropriate PPE (lab coat, gloves, eye protection)
2. PROCEDURE
A. DNA Extraction: 1. Thaw plasma samples at room temperature. 2.
Follow the DNA extraction kit protocol for extraction of viral DNA from
200 µL of plasma. 3. Elute the DNA into 100 µL of elution buffer. 4.
Store extracted DNA at -20°C if not proceeding immediately to PCR.
B. qPCR Setup: 1. Thaw all reagents (primers, probes, master mix)
on ice. 2. Prepare the qPCR reaction mix by combining the following
in a PCR clean room: - Master Mix: As per the manufacturer's
instructions - Primers and Probes: As per the manufacturer's
instructions - Nuclease-free water: To bring the total volume to 20 µL
per reaction 3. Add 5 µL of extracted DNA to each PCR reaction tube.
4. Ensure proper controls are included: - Negative Control: Nuclease-
free water - Positive Control: Known concentration of EBV DNA -
Internal Control: To rule out PCR inhibition
C. PCR Amplification: 1. Program the Real-Time PCR Instrument with
the following thermal cycling conditions: - Initial Denaturation: 95°C
for 10 minutes - Amplification: 40 cycles of: - Denaturation: 95°C for
15 seconds - Annealing/Extension: 60°C for 1 minute 2. Place the
reaction tubes into the PCR instrument. 3. Initiate the run and ensure
all reactions proceed to completion.
D. Data Analysis: 1. Upon completion of the run, review amplification
plots and cycle threshold (Ct) values for each sample. 2. Compare
the Ct values of the samples against standard curves generated from
known standards to determine the EBV DNA copies/mL. 3. Ensure all
controls (positive, negative, and internal) meet the acceptance
criteria: - Positive Control: Generates expected Ct value within the
specified range - Negative Control: No amplification (Ct > 40) -
Internal Control: Amplifies appropriately (Ct within validating range)
1. REPORTING RESULTS:
◦ Record results in the laboratory information system (LIS).
◦ Quantify EBV DNA in copies/mL based on standard curve
calculations.
◦ All results must be reviewed and verified by a technologist
before releasing the report.
2. QUALITY CONTROL:
◦ Perform DNA extraction and qPCR with appropriate control
samples with each run.
◦ Conduct weekly tests of internal quality control materials
and participate in external quality assessment programs.
◦ Document any deviations, troubleshooting steps, corrective
actions implemented, and maintenance performed.
3. REFERENCE INTERVALS:
◦ Above detectable range: Report specific copy number/mL
◦ Below detectable range: Report as "< Lower Limit of
Quantification" (e.g., <100 copies/mL)
4. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
◦ Refer to the manufacturer's kit insert for specific reagent and
instrument limitations.
5. REFERENCES:
◦ Manufacturer's PCR kit insert and user manuals for
equipment used
◦ Current literature on EBV DNA quantification methods
This SOP ensures consistency, reliability, and accuracy in generating
quantitative results for EBV DNA detection in plasma samples.
Regular review and updates should be conducted to incorporate
technological advancements and address any procedural
improvements.
