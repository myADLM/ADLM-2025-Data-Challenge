1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to outline a standardized protocol
for performing EPSTEIN-BARR VIRUS (EBV) IN SITU
HYBRIDIZATION (ISH) on tissue sections for the technical
component only, ensuring accurate and reliable detection of EBV.
2. SCOPE
This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) applies to all personnel
involved in the technical processing of samples for EBV ISH in the
laboratory. The results generated will be reviewed and interpreted by
a qualified pathologist.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Laboratory technologists are responsible for performing the
technical processing as per this SOP.
• Laboratory supervisors ensure that all personnel are trained and
competent to perform the procedure.
• The quality assurance team monitors adherence to the protocol
and addresses any deviations.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue sections.
• Optimal section thickness: 4-5 micrometers.
5. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• Deparaffinization reagents (e.g., xylene, ethanol series)
• Rehydration reagents (e.g., distilled water)
• Pretreatment solutions (e.g., Proteinase K)
• Hybridization buffer
• EBV-specific probe (commercially available)
• Detection reagents (chromogenic substrate)
• Mounting medium
• Positive and negative control tissues
• Staining equipment (e.g., slide stainer)
• Incubator or hybridization oven
6. EQUIPMENT
• Microtome for sectioning FFPE tissue blocks
• Slide warmer
• Oven
• Humidity chamber
• Microscope
• Positive pressure hood (if needed)
7. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation of Tissue Sections
1. Section FFPE tissue blocks at 4-5 micrometers.
2. Float sections onto pre-treated slides to enhance adhesion.
3. Air dry sections overnight at room temperature or dry in an
oven at 60°C for 1 hour.
B. Deparaffinization and Rehydration
1. Deparaffinize slides in xylene (2 changes, 10 minutes each).
2. Rehydrate through a graded ethanol series (100%, 95%, 70%)
for 3 minutes each.
3. Wash slides in distilled water for 3 minutes.
C. Pre-treatment
1. Pre-treat sections with Proteinase K solution for optimal time
and temperature as per manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Rinse sections in distilled water.
D. Hybridization
1. Apply EBV-specific probe to each section.
2. Cover with coverslip and seal with rubber cement to prevent
drying.
3. Incubate in hybridization oven at the temperature and duration
specified by the probe manufacturer.
E. Post-Hybridization Washes
1. Remove coverslip and perform stringent washes as
recommended by the probe manufacturer.
F. Detection
1. Apply the chromogenic substrate solution and incubate for the
recommended time.
2. Rinse sections in distilled water.
3. Counter-stain with hematoxylin if required.
4. Dehydrate through graded ethanol series and clear with xylene.
G. Mounting
1. Mount slides with coverslips using appropriate mounting
medium.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run positive and negative control tissues with every batch of
patient samples to ensure assay performance.
• Document lot numbers, expiration dates, and conditions of all
reagents used.
• Review control slide results before interpreting patient samples.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results from the EBV ISH will be reviewed and interpreted by a
qualified pathologist.
• The technical component includes ensuring slides are correctly
processed, stained, and suitable for review.
10. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Not applicable for the technical component.
11. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Ensure strict adherence to hybridization conditions; deviations
can lead to false negative/positive results.
• Interpretation of results is dependent on pathologist expertise.
12. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS
• Follow all laboratory safety guidelines, including the use of
appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE).
• Handle all biological specimens as potentially infectious.
13. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's instructions for all commercial reagents and
probes used.
• Current regulatory and accreditation standards for in situ
hybridization techniques.
14. DOCUMENT CONTROL
• Review and update this SOP biennially or as needed based on
protocol changes, new equipment, or updated manufacturer
instructions.
