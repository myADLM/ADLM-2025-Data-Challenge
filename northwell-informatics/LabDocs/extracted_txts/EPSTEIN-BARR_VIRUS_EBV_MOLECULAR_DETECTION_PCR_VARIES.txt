Standard Operating Procedure for EPSTEIN-BARR VIRUS (EBV),
MOLECULAR DETECTION, PCR, VARIES
1. PURPOSE
This protocol outlines the procedure for the molecular detection
of Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) using Polymerase Chain Reaction
(PCR) technology in the laboratory. The purpose is to ensure
accurate and reliable test results for patient diagnosis and
monitoring.
Responsibility:
◦ Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for
performing the PCR test, analyzing the results, and
maintaining records.
◦ Supervisors are responsible for ensuring the procedure is
followed and for addressing any issues that may arise.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
◦ Specimen type: Blood, plasma, serum, throat swab, or CSF
as per physician's recommendation.
◦ Collection containers: Sterile, DNA-free collection tubes.
Sodium citrate, sodium fluoride, EDTA, or heparinized
vacutainers are acceptable.
◦ Transport: Specimens must be transported to the laboratory
as soon as possible on ice, and should not be frozen.
Unacceptable Specimens:
◦ Non-sterile collection containers.
◦ Specimens received in containers other than the
recommended types.
◦ Specimens with significant hemolysis.
◦ Specimens received in laboratory more than 8 hours after
collection without prior freezing.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
◦ PCR Thermocycler
◦ Real-time PCR machine
◦ DNA extraction kit
◦ EBV-specific primers and probes
◦ Nuclease-free water
◦ Sterile pipette tips and tubes
◦ PCR master mix
Quality Control Material:
◦ Positive control: Known EBV DNA sample.
◦ Negative control: Nuclease-free water.
4. PROCEDURE
A) DNA Extraction:
◦ Follow the DNA extraction kit protocol to isolate DNA from
the specimen.
◦ Validate the extracted DNA quantity and quality using
spectrophotometry (NanoDrop) or fluorometry.
◦ Store extracted DNA at -20°C until PCR setup.
B) PCR Setup:
◦ Prepare PCR master mix following the manufacturer's
instructions.
◦ Aliquot the master mix into PCR tubes or plates.
◦ Add extracted DNA template to each tube/plate.
◦ Include positive and negative controls in each run.
Thermal Cycling Conditions:
◦ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 5 minutes.
◦ Cycling steps (45 cycles):
▪ Denaturation: 95°C for 15 seconds.
▪ Annealing: 55-60°C for 30 seconds (temperature based
on primer optimization).
▪ Extension: 72°C for 30 seconds.
◦ Final extension: 72°C for 5 minutes.
◦ Hold at 4°C.
5. ANALYZING RESULTS
A) Real-Time Data Analysis:
◦ Monitor the amplification plot.
◦ Determine cycle threshold (Ct) value for each sample.
◦ Compare Ct values to positive and negative controls.
B) Interpretation of Results:
◦ Positive result: Detectable amplification with a Ct value
within the laboratory's confirmed positive range.
◦ Negative result: No detectable amplification; Ct value
indicates no presence of EBV DNA.
◦ Indeterminate result: Amplification seen near the threshold;
recommend repeat testing.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Perform quality control checks with each PCR run using
positive and negative controls.
◦ Document control results and any deviations from expected
outcomes.
◦ If controls fail, do not report patient results. Troubleshoot
and repeat the assay.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ Review and verify results by the designated personnel.
◦ Record results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
◦ Report critical results to the physician immediately.
8. REFERENCE INTERVALS
◦ Positive: Detected EBV DNA.
◦ Negative: EBV DNA not detected.
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
◦ Cross-contamination can lead to false positives. Use sterile
techniques.
◦ Variations in specimen handling and storage can affect DNA
integrity and PCR results.
◦ Ensure quality of reagents and proper equipment
maintenance.
