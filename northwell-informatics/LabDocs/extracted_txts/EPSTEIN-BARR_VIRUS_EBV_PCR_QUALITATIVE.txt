Standard Operating Procedure: Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) PCR,
Qualitative
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for the qualitative detection of Epstein-Barr
Virus (EBV) DNA in clinical specimens using Polymerase Chain
Reaction (PCR). This test is used to diagnose and monitor EBV
infection.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing
the test, ensuring quality control, and documenting results.
• Supervisors ensure compliance with this SOP and confirm that
corrective actions are implemented when necessary.
1. DEFINITION
The Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) PCR is a qualitative assay performed
to detect the presence of EBV DNA in clinical specimens, such as
blood, plasma, serum, cerebrospinal fluid, and other body fluids.
1. PROCEDURE
Sample Requirements:
• Sample Types: Blood, plasma, serum, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF),
and other body fluids.
• Volume: Minimum of 1 mL.
• Storage: Store specimens at 2-8°C if tested within 24 hours. For
long-term storage, freeze at -20°C or lower.
• Rejection Criteria: Specimens with visible contamination,
hemolyzed samples, or those not stored/transported under
appropriate conditions.
Equipment and Reagents:
• PCR Thermocycler
• DNA Extraction Kit specific for clinical specimens
• Primers and Probes for EBV DNA
• PCR Master Mix
• Nuclease-free water
• Positive and Negative controls
• Sterile, aerosol-resistant pipette tips
• Microcentrifuge tubes
Testing Procedure:
A. DNA Extraction
1. Thaw specimens and controls to room temperature.
2. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for the DNA extraction kit
to isolate DNA from the clinical specimens.
3. Measure and document the concentration and purity of the
extracted DNA using a spectrophotometer or similar device.
B. PCR Preparation
1. Prepare the PCR Master Mix according to the manufacturer’s
instructions, including primers, probes, nucleotides, and Taq
polymerase.
2. Aliquot the Master Mix into PCR tubes or plates.
3. Add extracted DNA to each tube, including positive and
negative control samples.
4. Ensure that each PCR run contains at least one positive
control, one negative control, and a no-template control (NTC).
C. PCR Amplification
1. Load the PCR tubes or plates into the thermocycler.
2. Program the thermocycler for the following conditions:
◦ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 10 minutes
◦ Amplification cycles (40 cycles):
▪ Denaturation: 95°C for 15 seconds
▪ Annealing: 55-60°C (optimal temperature based on
primers) for 30 seconds
▪ Extension: 72°C for 30 seconds
◦ Final extension: 72°C for 7 minutes
3. Start the thermocycler and monitor the reaction.
D. Post-PCR Analysis
1. After the PCR run is complete, analyze the amplified products
using an appropriate detection method (e.g., agarose gel
electrophoresis, real-time PCR instrument for fluorescence
detection).
2. Confirm the presence of EBV DNA by comparing the bands or
fluorescence signals of the test samples to the controls.
3. Interpret the results:
◦ Positive: Presence of the expected amplification product
size indicates EBV DNA.
◦ Negative: Absence of the expected amplification product
size.
4. Quality Control
• Run positive and negative controls with each batch of specimens
processed.
• Quality control results must be documented and reviewed.
• If controls do not produce expected results, troubleshoot and
repeat the test.
1. Reporting Results
• Document results in the laboratory information system (LIS).
• Positive results: Report as "EBV DNA detected."
• Negative results: Report as "EBV DNA not detected."
• Include any relevant clinical information or comments if required.
• Critical results should be communicated immediately to the
requesting clinician.
