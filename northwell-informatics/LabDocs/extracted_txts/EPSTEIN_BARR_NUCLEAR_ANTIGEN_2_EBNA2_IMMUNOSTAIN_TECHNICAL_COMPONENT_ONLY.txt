Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Epstein Barr Nuclear Antigen 2 (EBNA2)
Immunostain, Technical Component Only
1. PURPOSE
To provide a detailed, standardized procedure for the
immunohistochemical staining of Epstein Barr Nuclear Antigen 2
(EBNA2) for the detection in tissue sections, ensuring consistent and
reliable results.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing
the immunostain assay using approved procedures.
• Quality control checks and documentation are the responsibility of
all laboratory staff involved in the staining process.
1. DEFINITIONS
For the purposes of this SOP:
• EBNA2: Epstein Barr Nuclear Antigen 2, an antigen associated
with Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) infection.
• IHC: Immunohistochemistry, a staining process used in
immunology to detect antigens in cells.
1. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
• Microtome
• Water bath
• Forced air or automated slide dryer
• Staining jars or automated stainer
• Microscope
• EBNA2 primary antibody (properly stored as specified by
manufacturer; typically at 2-8°C)
• Secondary antibody and detection reagents for IHC
• Positive and negative control tissues
• Slides
• Coverslips
• Mounting medium
• Humidified chamber, if necessary
1. REAGENTS AND STORAGE
• Primary EBNA2 antibody
• Citrate buffer (or other antigen retrieval solution)
• Peroxidase blocking solution
• Secondary antibody reagent
• Chromogen (e.g., DAB - diaminobenzidine)
• Hematoxylin
• Distilled water
• Phosphate buffered saline (PBS)
Note: Reagents should be stored according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Do not use reagents beyond their expiration dates.
1. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Paraffin-embedded Tissue Section Preparation:
◦ Cut formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue blocks into 4
µm sections using a microtome.
◦ Place sections on positively charged slides and dry in an
oven at 60°C for at least 1 hour until paraffin is completely
melted.
2. Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
◦ Deparaffinize slides in xylene for 10 minutes.
◦ Rehydrate through a graded series of ethanol (100%, 95%,
70%) for 5 minutes each.
◦ Rinse slides in distilled water.
3. Antigen Retrieval:
◦ Incubate slides in citrate buffer (pH 6.0) and heat in a
microwave or pressure cooker for 20 minutes.
◦ Allow slides to cool in buffer for 30 minutes.
◦ Rinse in distilled water followed by PBS.
4. Staining Procedure:
◦ Block endogenous peroxidase activity by incubating slides
in peroxidase blocking solution for 10 minutes.
◦ Apply primary anti-EBNA2 antibody to sections and incubate
in a humidified chamber for 30-60 minutes.
◦ Rinse slides in PBS.
◦ Apply secondary antibody and incubate as specified by the
manufacturer's protocol.
◦ Rinse in PBS.
◦ Apply chromogen (DAB or other) to slides; incubate for 5-10
minutes or until coloring develops.
◦ Rinse slides in distilled water.
5. Counterstaining:
◦ Dip slides in hematoxylin for 30 seconds.
◦ Rinse slides in water.
◦ Differentiate in 0.3% acid alcohol for a few seconds.
◦ Rinse in water and then blue with PBS.
6. Dehydration and Mounting:
◦ Dehydrate through a graded series of ethanol (70%, 95%,
100%).
◦ Clear in xylene.
◦ Mount coverslip using mounting medium.
Quality Control:
• Include positive and negative control slides with each staining run.
• Document the condition of control tissues and verify appropriate
staining outcomes.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING
If expected staining does not occur, consider the following:
• Ensure proper reagent storage and expiration.
• Confirm antigen retrieval steps were completed.
• Validate antibody specificity and incubation times.
• Check proper functioning of equipment such as heating devices.
1. RESULT DOCUMENTATION
Results should be documented in the Laboratory Information System
(LIS) with verification:
• Positive staining for EBNA2 indicated by nuclear coloration in
sample sections.
• Negative controls should show no specific staining.
1. LIMITATIONS
Immunohistochemical staining involves subjective interpretation;
ensure appropriate controls and adherence to standardized
techniques. Variability may result from differences in tissue fixation,
sectioning, or antibody-antigen interactions.

organizations (e.g., CAP, CLIA).
Review and Amending SOP:
This SOP must be reviewed annually, and amendments made as
needed to ensure compliance with updated laboratory standards and
technological advancements.
