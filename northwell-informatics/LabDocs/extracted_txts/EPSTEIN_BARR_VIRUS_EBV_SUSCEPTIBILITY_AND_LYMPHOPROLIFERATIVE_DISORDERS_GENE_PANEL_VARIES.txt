Protocol for the Analytical Phase of Generating Results
for Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) Susceptibility and
Lymphoproliferative Disorders Gene Panel, Varies
1. PURPOSE
This protocol outlines the procedures for the analytical phase of
generating results for the EBV Susceptibility and Lymphoproliferative
Disorders Gene Panel. This includes proper handling, processing,
and analysis of the samples to ensure accurate and reliable results.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred Specimen:
◦ 3-5 mL of blood collected in an EDTA tube (lavender top).
Ensure the sample is well-mixed by gently inverting the tube
several times immediately after collection.
◦ DNA isolated from peripheral blood or other relevant tissue,
stored at -20°C.
• Unacceptable Specimens:
◦ Hemolyzed, clotted or insufficient volume samples.
◦ Specimens not properly labeled or that have exceeded
stability conditions.
3. REAGENTS AND EQUIPMENT
• Reagents:
◦ DNA extraction kit.
◦ qPCR Master Mix.
◦ Primers and probes specific for EBV susceptibility genes and
lymphoproliferative disorders genes.
◦ Control DNA samples (positive and negative controls).
• Equipment:
◦ Centrifuge.
◦ Thermal cycler for qPCR.
◦ Vortex mixer.
◦ Pipettes and pipette tips.
◦ Refrigerated microcentrifuge.
◦ Clean workbench and appropriate PPE (gloves, lab coat,
safety glasses).
4. PROCEDURE
A. DNA EXTRACTION
1. Verify Sample Integrity:
◦ Inspect received samples for proper labeling and physical
integrity.
◦ Document the receipt and condition of samples.
2. DNA Isolation:
◦ Follow the manufacturer's instructions provided with the
DNA extraction kit.
◦ Use a positive control to ensure quality extraction.
◦ Measure and document DNA concentration and purity using
a spectrophotometer.
3. Storage of Extracted DNA:
◦ Store extracted DNA at -20°C until ready for analysis.
B. qPCR SETUP
1. Preparation:
◦ Thaw all reagents and DNA samples on ice.
◦ Prepare qPCR Master Mix according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
2. Reaction Setup:
◦ In a sterile work area, set up qPCR reactions in a 96-well
plate:
▪ Add Master Mix to each well.
▪ Add specific primers and probes to each well.
▪ Add extracted DNA samples, positive and negative
controls to respective wells.
▪ Ensure reactions are set up in triplicate to confirm
consistency of results.
3. Thermal Cycling Conditions:
◦ Program the thermal cycler with the following settings:
▪ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 10 minutes.
▪ Amplification cycles (40 cycles): 95°C for 15 seconds,
60°C for 1 minute.
▪ Follow the specific protocol adjustments provided by the
reagent manufacturer.
C. DATA ANALYSIS
1. Run Quality Control:
◦ Verify that positive and negative controls have performed as
expected.
◦ Repeat any run in which controls do not meet predefined
criteria.
2. Interpretation:
◦ Analyze the qPCR output using the software provided with
the thermal cycler.
◦ Examine the amplification curves and threshold cycles (Ct
values) to determine the presence or absence of the target
genes.
◦ Compare Ct values of the patient samples with the control
samples for interpretation.
3. Criteria for Positive/Negative Results:
◦ Positive Result: Ct value within the expected range for
target genes, confirming the presence of EBV susceptibility
or lymphoproliferative disorder markers.
◦ Negative Result: No amplification or Ct value beyond the
threshold cycle for negative controls.
D. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Documentation:
◦ Enter the results into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
◦ Verify and review all data for accuracy and completeness.
2. Result Review:
◦ Check specimen integrity and control results before
confirming final results.
◦ Include notes on any issues encountered and the steps
taken for resolution.
3. Reporting:
◦ Authorized laboratory personnel must review and verify
results before final reporting.
◦ Provide clear and concise results including the gene panel
findings, interpretation, and any recommendations for
further testing if applicable.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform regular maintenance and calibration of qPCR equipment.
• Include positive and negative controls in each batch of tests.
• Document all quality control checks and corrective actions if any
discrepancy is observed.
