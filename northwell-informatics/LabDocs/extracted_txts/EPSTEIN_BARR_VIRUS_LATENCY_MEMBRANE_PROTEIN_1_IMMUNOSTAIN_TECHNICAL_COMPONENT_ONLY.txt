Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
1. PURPOSE:
This SOP describes the protocol for the analytical phase of
generating results for Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) Latency Membrane
Protein 1 (LMP1) Immunostain, Technical Component Only. It
outlines the necessary steps to ensure accurate and reproducible
staining, interpretation, and documentation of results.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory technologists are responsible for performing
and documenting the steps outlined in this SOP. Supervisors are
responsible for ensuring compliance with this procedure and for
addressing any technical issues that may arise.
2. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES:
• Automated immunostainer (e.g., Ventana Benchmark, Dako
Autostainer)
• EBV LMP1 primary antibody
• Detection kit (e.g., HRP detection kit)
• Positive and negative control tissue sections
• Slides and cover slips
• Mounting medium
• Xylene
• Ethanol (100%, 95%, and 70%)
• Deionized water
• Hematoxylin
• Equipment and reagents for antigen retrieval (e.g., microwave or
pressure cooker, retrieval buffer)
• Incubator or slide stainer for temperature-controlled steps
3. PROCEDURE:
A. Sample Preparation:
1. Ensure that formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue samples
are properly prepared and sectioned at 4-5 micrometers
thickness.
2. Mount tissue sections on positively charged or silanized slides.
3. Bake slides at 60°C for 1 hour to ensure tissue adherence.
B. Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
1. Deparaffinize slides by submerging them in xylene for 3
changes, 5 minutes each.
2. Rehydrate slides through a series of graded ethanols:
◦ 100% ethanol, 2 changes, 5 minutes each
◦ 95% ethanol, 1 change, 5 minutes
◦ 70% ethanol, 1 change, 5 minutes
3. Rinse slides in deionized water for 5 minutes.
C. Antigen Retrieval:
1. Place slides in a heat-resistant container with antigen retrieval
buffer (e.g., citrate buffer, pH 6.0).
2. Perform antigen retrieval by heating slides in a microwave,
pressure cooker, or other appropriate device according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
3. Allow slides to cool to room temperature in the retrieval buffer.
4. Rinse slides in deionized water for 5 minutes.
D. Immunostaining:
1. Load slides into the automated immunostainer following the
manufacturer's instructions.
2. Select the EBV LMP1 staining protocol on the instrument.
3. Load the primary antibody, detection kit reagents, and any
required controls into the instrument.
4. Start the run and allow the instrument to complete the staining
procedure, including incubation with primary antibody,
application of detection reagents, and counterstaining with
hematoxylin.
E. Post-Staining Processing:
1. Remove slides from the instrument and rinse in deionized water
to remove any excess reagents.
2. Dehydrate slides through graded ethanols (70%, 95%, 100%)
and clear in xylene.
3. Mount coverslips using an appropriate mounting medium.
F. Quality Control:
1. Each staining run must include known positive and negative
control slides.
2. Ensure that the positive control shows specific staining, and the
negative control shows no staining.
3. Review the control slides before evaluating patient samples to
ensure assay validity.
G. Interpretation and Documentation:
1. Assess stained slides under a microscope.
2. Verify that all control slides have shown the expected staining
patterns.
3. Document findings in the laboratory information system (LIS),
noting the presence or absence of EBV LMP1 staining in
patient samples.
H. Troubleshooting:
1. If staining is suboptimal or controls do not perform as expected,
troubleshoot according to the following steps:
◦ Verify the integrity of antibodies and reagents.
◦ Check instrument calibration and maintenance records.
◦ Repeat staining run using fresh reagents and controls if
necessary.
◦ Consult the supervisor for further guidance.
4. REPORTING RESULTS:
Results for the EBV LMP1 immunostain are to be recorded and
reported after confirmation by a designated pathologist. Only
technical components are reported, and all results must be entered
into the LIS accurately.
5. REFERENCES:
• Product inserts and protocols for primary antibodies and detection
kits.
• Instrument manufacturer’s user manuals.
• Laboratory’s internal quality control and assurance guidelines.
6. RECORD KEEPING:
All records of staining runs, including control results, troubleshooting
logs, and maintenance records, must be kept up-to-date and readily
available for review.
7. SAFETY:
• Follow all laboratory safety guidelines, including the use of
personal protective equipment (PPE).
• Handle all reagents, including xylene and ethanol, in a well-
ventilated area and according to MSDS guidelines.
