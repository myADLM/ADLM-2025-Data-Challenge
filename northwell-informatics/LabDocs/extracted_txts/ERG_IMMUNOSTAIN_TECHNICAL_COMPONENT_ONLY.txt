Standard Operating Procedure: ERG Immunostain (Technical
Component Only)
1. PURPOSE
To provide detailed instructions for the execution of the technical
component of immunostaining tissue specimens for ERG protein
expression analysis, ensuring standardized and reproducible results.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory technicians and histotechnologists are
responsible for performing the immunostaining according to the
procedure outlined and ensuring proper documentation. Staff
members must identify and report any inconsistencies or errors to the
supervisor.
1. DEFINITION
ERG Immunostain: An immunohistochemistry procedure used to
detect the presence of ERG protein in tissue sections, often
employed in the identification and study of various cell types and
cancer diagnostics.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Pre-Analytical Steps
Specimen Receipt & Accessioning:
• Confirm that all specimens have been properly accessioned and
recorded.
• Verify that all specimens have proper labeling and documentation.
• Ensure tissue specimens are adequately fixed in 10% neutral
buffered formalin and processed to paraffin wax.
B. Preparation of Tissue Sections
1. Sectioning:
• Cut paraffin-embedded tissue blocks into 4-µm thick sections.
• Float sections on a water bath at 40-45°C and pick up on
positively charged glass slides.
• Ensure tissue sections are properly oriented.
1. Slide Drying:
• Dry slides upright in a vertical rack at 37°C overnight (at least 12
hours) or at 60°C for 1 hour.
C. Deparaffinization and Rehydration
1. Deparaffinization:
• Place slides in a xylene bath for 2 x 5 minutes.
1. Rehydration:
• Continue through two changes of 100% ethanol for 5 minutes
each.
• Follow with two changes of 95% ethanol for 3 minutes each.
• Rinse in distilled water for 2 x 5 minutes.
D. Antigen Retrieval
1. Perform heat-induced epitope retrieval (HIER) using a pressure
cooker or microwave oven with a suitable antigen retrieval
solution such as citrate buffer (pH 6.0) or TRIS-EDTA buffer (pH
9.0):
• Heat sections in retrieval solution for 10-20 minutes at 95-99°C.
• Allow slides to cool for 20 minutes inside the retrieval solution.
• Rinse thoroughly with distilled water.
E. Immunostaining
1. Blocking Endogenous Peroxidase:
• Immerse slides in 3% hydrogen peroxide in methanol for 10
minutes to block endogenous peroxidase activity.
• Rinse with distilled water and wash slide with PBS (phosphate-
buffered saline).
1. Primary Antibody Application:
• Apply a ready-to-use ERG antibody (or diluted according to
manufacturer’s instructions) to tissue sections.
• Incubate for the recommended time (usually 30-60 minutes) at
room temperature.
1. Washing Steps:
• Rinse slides with PBS or TBS (Tris-buffered saline) for 3 x 5
minutes.
1. Secondary Antibody Application:
• Apply a suitable secondary antibody (e.g., biotinylated anti-
mouse/rabbit IgG) as per the manufacturer’s instructions.
• Incubate at room temperature for the recommended time (usually
30 minutes).
1. Washing Steps:
• Rinse slides with PBS or TBS for 3 x 5 minutes.
1. Signal Detection:
• Apply an avidin-biotin complex (ABC) solution or a polymer-based
detection system.
• Incubate for the time prescribed by the manufacturer (10-20
minutes for ABC, or as per polymer-based kit instructions).
• Rinse with PBS or TBS for 3 x 5 minutes.
1. Color Development:
• Incubate slides in a solution of 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (DAB) or
another chromogen until the desired staining intensity develops.
• Rinse with distilled water.
F. Counterstaining
• Immerse slides in hematoxylin for 2-5 minutes to counterstain.
• Rinse slides in running tap water for 5 minutes.
• Optionally dip slides in dilute ammonia water or Scott's tap water
for blueing.
• Wash briefly in running tap water.
G. Dehydration and Mounting
1. Dehydration:
• Immerse slides in 95% ethanol for 2 minutes.
• Immerse two changes of 100% ethanol for 2 minutes each.
• Clear slides in xylene for 2 x 5 minutes.
1. Mounting:
• Mount coverslips using a synthetic mounting medium compatible
with DAB chromogen.
H. Documentation and Quality Control
1. Documentation:
• Document reagent lot numbers, incubation times, and any
deviations from the SOP in the laboratory logbook.
• Record the slide identification, staining date, and histotechnologist
initials.
1. Quality Control:
• Include appropriate positive and negative control slides in each
staining run.
• Validate the staining quality and report any issues to the
supervisor.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
Since this procedure only includes the technical component of ERG
staining, slides should be sent to the pathologist for interpretation and
final diagnostic reporting.
1. METHODS LIMITATIONS
Refer to the antibody and detection reagent inserts for specific
limitations. Additionally, factors such as tissue fixation, handling, and
processing may affect staining quality.
