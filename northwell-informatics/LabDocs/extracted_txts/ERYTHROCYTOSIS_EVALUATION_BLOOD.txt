Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for ERYTHROCYTOSIS
EVALUATION, BLOOD
1. PURPOSE
To provide a clear and precise protocol for the analytical phase of
generating results for Erythrocytosis Evaluation, Blood, ensuring
accurate, consistent and reliable determinations are made and
reported.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of the trained laboratory technologist to follow
this protocol precisely. Supervisors are responsible for monitoring the
adherence to this SOP and for handling any encountered issues
during the analytical phase.
2. DEFINITION
Erythrocytosis (or polycythemia) is characterized by an increased
number of red blood cells in the bloodstream. This evaluation
involves a series of tests and measurements to help diagnose the
underlying condition causing erythrocytosis.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENT:
Preferred:
• 5 mL of venous blood drawn into a lavender-top EDTA tube.
• Ensure the specimen is mixed well by gentle inversion
immediately after collection.
• Specimen must be transported to the laboratory within 2 hours of
collection.
Unacceptable:
• Hemolyzed, clotted, or improperly labeled specimens.
• Specimens that are more than 24 hours old if stored at 2-8°C.
4. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES:
• Automated Hematology Analyzer
• Reagents for Complete Blood Count (CBC) procurement including
additives used for erythropoietin (EPO) testing
• Calibrated pipettes
• Quality control materials
• Centrifuge
• Refrigerator (2-8°C)
• Biohazard disposal containers
5. PROCEDURE:
A) Complete Blood Count (CBC):
1. Ensure the hematology analyzer is calibrated and maintain
appropriate controls.
2. Load the EDTA tube sample into the hematology analyzer.
3. Run the CBC, ensuring the following relevant parameters are
measured:
◦ Hemoglobin concentration (Hb)
◦ Hematocrit (Hct)
◦ Red blood cell (RBC) count
◦ Mean corpuscular volume (MCV)
4. Record the results and review them for consistency and
potential errors.
B) Erythropoietin (EPO) Level:
1. Centrifuge the EDTA tube sample at 1500 x g for 10 minutes at
room temperature to separate plasma.
2. Carefully aliquot the plasma into a labeled secondary tube for
EPO assessment.
3. Store the plasma at 2-8°C if not analyzed immediately.
4. Set up the EPO immunoassay equipment as per the
manufacturer’s instructions.
5. Run the EPO analysis using appropriate reagents and maintain
controls.
6. Document the EPO concentration.
C) Additional Tests (if relevant):
1. Serum Ferritin, Vitamin B12, Folate levels, and Jak2 V617F
Mutation Analysis should follow respective testing protocols
outlined in their individual SOPs if ordered.
2. Document additional test outcomes in correspondence with
overall patient report.
6. QUALITY CONTROL:
1. Run quality control samples with known concentrations at the
start and end of each batch of patient samples.
2. Results should fall within the manufacturer’s specified range.
3. Control values must be recorded, reviewed, and any out-of-
range results must prompt repeat testing and investigation.
7. REPORTING RESULTS:
1. Verify all analytical results obtained against the respective
reference intervals:
◦ Hemoglobin: 13.2-16.6 g/dL (males), 11.6-15 g/dL (females)
◦ Hematocrit: 38.3-48.6% (males), 35.5-44.9% (females)
◦ RBC Count: 4.35-5.65 x10^12/L (males), 3.92-5.13 x10^12/L
(females)
◦ EPO: 4.3-29 mIU/ml
2. Any critical values or significant abnormalities must be promptly
reported to a supervising pathologist or attending physician and
documented as per site-specific guidelines.
3. Enter verified data into the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
for seamless integration with patient records.
4. Ensure critical results are communicated as per the defined
critical result communication policy.

9. NOTES:
• Caution must be exercised to avoid sample contamination.
• Adherence to all health and safety regulations for handling
biological specimens is essential.
• Ensure compliance with CLIA guidelines for the implementation of
laboratory tests.
By adhering to this SOP, the laboratory can ensure precise and
efficient erythrocytosis evaluations contributing effectively to patient
diagnosis and care.
