1. PURPOSE
To establish a standardized protocol for the accurate analytical
interpretation of erythrocytosis utilizing patient data obtained from
laboratory tests.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of all designated clinical laboratory scientists
and technologists to follow this SOP for erythrocytosis interpretation
and generation of results. Supervisors must ensure compliance with
the protocol and address any discrepancies observed during the
analytical process.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen types: Peripheral blood (preferred), venous blood
Collection Tubes: EDTA tube (lavender top), Heparin tube (green top)
Specimen Stability: - EDTA: Stable for 24 hours at 2-8°C after
collection - Heparin: Stable for 48 hours at 2-8°C after collection
Unacceptable specimens: Clotted, hemolyzed, or improperly labelled
specimens.
1. MATERIALS, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Complete blood count (CBC) analyzer
• Reagents and controls for CBC analysis
• Peripheral blood smear preparation supplies
• Microscope for microscopic analysis
• Hemoglobin electrophoresis or High-Performance Liquid
Chromatography (HPLC) equipment if abnormal
hemoglobinopathies are suspected
• Supplies for molecular testing (JAK2 V617F mutational analysis)
1. PROCEDURE
A. Complete Blood Count (CBC) Analysis:
• Perform CBC using the automated CBC analyzer according to the
manufacturer’s guidelines.
• Document and verify the following parameters:
◦ Hemoglobin (Hb)
◦ Hematocrit (Hct)
◦ Red blood cell count (RBC)
◦ Mean corpuscular volume (MCV)
◦ Mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH)
◦ Red cell distribution width (RDW)
If any of the above parameters fall outside the reference range, a review of historical values and potential confounding factors such as recent blood transfusion or dehydration should be undertaken before reporting.
B. Peripheral Blood Smear Examination:
• Prepare and stain a peripheral blood smear using Wright-Giemsa
stain.
• Examine the smear under a microscope for red cell morphology,
including anisocytosis, poikilocytosis, polychromasia, and any
erythroid precursors.
• Note and document the presence of any abnormal cellular
findings.
C. Secondary Testing:
• Hemoglobinopathy Testing: If CBC results suggest the presence
of hemoglobinopathy, perform hemoglobin electrophoresis or
HPLC to assess the presence and types of abnormal hemoglobin.
• Molecular Testing: Perform JAK2 V617F mutation analysis if
polycythemia vera (a primary erythrocytosis) is suspected.
• Erythropoietin (EPO) Levels: Measure EPO levels if secondary
causes of erythrocytosis, such as chronic hypoxia or tumors
producing EPO, are suspected.
D. Interpretation:
• Integrate CBC parameters and additional test results to assess
erythrocytosis.
• Determine if the erythrocytosis is primary (e.g., polycythemia
vera) or secondary (e.g., chronic hypoxia, EPO-producing
tumors).
• Compare results against reference intervals and consider patient
historical values, clinical symptoms, and previous medical history.
E. Quality Control: - Utilize quality control (QC) material daily and
with each new batch of reagents. - Document QC results and ensure
they fall within acceptable ranges. - If QC results are outside
acceptable ranges, initiate troubleshooting protocols according to the
manufacturer’s recommendations and do not release patient results
until resolved.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Transmit analytical results to the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
• Review and verify all results by the laboratory technologist.
• Generate a comprehensive report including an interpretation of
the CBC and secondary testing results for clinician review.
• Document and inform a supervisor of any critical values requiring
immediate clinical attention.
• Ensure proper referencing of methodology, interpretation notes,
and quality control measures applied during the analytical phase.
