Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase:
Generating Results for ERYTHROCYTOSIS SUMMARY
INTERPRETATION
1. PURPOSE
To standardize the procedure for generating and interpreting
laboratory results related to erythrocytosis, ensuring accurate and
timely reporting of results.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing and
documenting the procedures outlined in this SOP. Supervisors are
responsible for ensuring adherence to the protocol and for
addressing any deficiencies.
2. DEFINITION
Erythrocytosis is defined as an increased red blood cell mass and
may be primary or secondary to other conditions. This protocol
outlines the analytical steps and interpretation criteria for laboratory
tests related to erythrocytosis.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Hematology analyzers (e.g., Sysmex XN-1000, Abbott CELL-DYN
Ruby)
• Reagents and control materials specified by the analyzer
manufacturer
• Calibrators specific to erythrocytosis-related assays
• Requisition forms and sample labels
• Personal protective equipment (PPE) – gloves, lab coat, safety
glasses
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred Specimen: Whole blood collected in EDTA (lavender-
top) tube
• Specimen Volume: Minimum 2 mL of whole blood
• Specimen Stability:
◦ Room temperature: 24 hours
◦ Refrigerated: 48 hours
◦ Do not freeze samples
5. PROCEDURE
Sample Preparation and Loading:
1. Verify patient identification and match with requisition forms.
2. Inspect the specimen for proper labeling and absence of clots.
3. Mix the whole blood sample thoroughly by gentle inversion.
4. Load the prepared sample onto the hematology analyzer.
Running the Assay:
1. Select the appropriate test panel for erythrocytosis on the
analyzer.
2. Start the analysis according to the manufacturer's instructions.
3. Monitor the analyzer for any alerts or error messages during the
run.
Quality Control:
1. Run quality control (QC) samples at the start of each shift and
after any maintenance or recalibration.
2. Review QC results to ensure they fall within the manufacturer’s
acceptable range.
3. Document all QC results and any corrective actions taken.
Result Verification and Interpretation:
1. Review the following hematological parameters:
◦ Hemoglobin (Hb)
◦ Hematocrit (Hct)
◦ Red Blood Cell (RBC) count
◦ Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV)
◦ Red Cell Distribution Width (RDW)
2. Assess the parameters for indications of erythrocytosis:
◦ Elevated Hb and Hct values consistent with erythrocytosis.
◦ Elevated RBC count.
◦ MCV and RDW values to determine whether erythrocytes
are normocytic/normochromic.
3. Rule out secondary causes by reviewing other laboratory
results (Erythropoietin levels, JAK2 mutation analysis, etc.) if
available.
4. Using the laboratory information system (LIS), generate a
summary interpretation based on the results:
◦ Primary Erythrocytosis: Elevated RBC parameters with a
normal or low erythropoietin level, possible mutation
analysis.
◦ Secondary Erythrocytosis: Elevated RBC parameters with a
high erythropoietin level, clinical context considered.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Review and verify results within the LIS.
2. Ensure that all results flagged as critical or abnormal are
rechecked and confirmed.
3. Document any manual calculations or additional observations in
the LIS.
4. Generate and print the final report for physician review.
7. SAMPLE INTEGRITY
1. If the sample integrity is in question (e.g., hemolysis, clotting),
consider repeating the test with a new specimen, if possible.
2. Document any issues with sample integrity and actions taken.
8. CRITICAL VALUES
1. Report any critical values immediately to the responsible
healthcare provider.
2. Document the critical result notification in the LIS, including the
date, time, and name of the individual notified.

10. AMENDMENTS
This SOP must be reviewed annually by the laboratory supervisor
and updated as necessary to reflect any changes in methodology or
technology.
