Protocol for Analytical Phase of Generating Results for EPOR
Gene Exon 8 Sequencing, Whole Blood
I. Purpose The purpose of this protocol is to outline the analytical
procedures for EPOR gene exon 8 sequencing using whole blood
specimens. The goal is to ensure accurate and reliable results for
diagnostic and research purposes.
II. Responsibility It is the responsibility of designated laboratory
personnel to follow the outlined procedures for EPOR gene
sequencing. All steps must be performed with precision and
documented appropriately.
III. Specimen
• Specimen Type: Whole blood
• Collection Tube: EDTA tubes
• Volume: Minimum 3 mL
• Storage and Stability: Store at 4°C and process within 48 hours of
collection. If longer storage is needed, specimens may be frozen
at -20°C or lower.
IV. Equipment and Reagents
• DNA Extraction Kit (e.g., Qiagen, Promega)
• PCR reagents (e.g., primers for EPOR exon 8, Taq polymerase)
• Agarose gel electrophoresis equipment
• DNA sequencing machine (e.g., Applied Biosystems, Illumina)
• Nucleotide sequencing reagents (e.g., BigDye Terminator v3.1
Cycle Sequencing Kit)
• Computer with software for sequence analysis (e.g., BLAST,
Chromas)
V. Procedure
A. DNA Extraction
1. Whole Blood Sample Preparation:
◦ Centrifuge the EDTA tube at 1500 rpm for 10 minutes.
◦ Carefully draw off the plasma layer.
◦ Resuspend the cell pellet in the remaining volume of
sample.
2. DNA Isolation Using Extraction Kit:
◦ Follow the manufacturer's protocol.
◦ Elute the extracted DNA in a low volume of elution buffer
(e.g., 50-100 µL).
B. PCR Amplification
1. Preparation:
◦ Design primers flanking EPOR exon 8.
◦ Prepare the PCR reaction mixture (20 µL total volume).
▪ Master Mix: Contains dNTPs, buffer, Taq polymerase.
▪ Primers: Forward and Reverse primers specific for
EPOR exon 8.
▪ DNA Template: 10-20 ng of extracted DNA.
2. Thermal Cycling Conditions:
◦ Denaturation: 95°C for 2 minutes.
◦ Cycling: 35 cycles of:
▪ Denaturation: 95°C for 30 seconds.
▪ Annealing: 55-60°C for 30 seconds (specific temperature
may vary based on primer design).
▪ Extension: 72°C for 1 minute.
◦ Final Extension: 72°C for 5 minutes.
3. PCR Product Verification:
◦ Run a 1.5-2% agarose gel electrophoresis with ethidium
bromide.
◦ Verify the presence of targeted amplicon (~200-400 bp).
C. Sequencing Reaction
1. Preparation:
◦ Clean up PCR product using a purification kit or enzymatic
method.
◦ Quantify purified DNA.
2. Sequencing Reaction Setup:
◦ Set up sequencing reaction mixture (~10 µL total volume).
▪ Purified PCR product.
▪ Sequencing primer (either forward or reverse).
▪ Sequencing reagents (e.g., BigDye Terminator mix).
3. Thermal Cycling Conditions:
◦ Denaturation: 96°C for 1 minute.
◦ Cycling: 30 cycles of:
▪ Denaturation: 96°C for 10 seconds.
▪ Annealing: 50°C for 5 seconds.
▪ Extension: 60°C for 4 minutes.
D. Sequence Analysis
1. Purification:
◦ Purify the sequencing reaction using ethanol precipitation.
2. Capillary Electrophoresis:
◦ Load purified sequencing product onto the sequencing
machine.
◦ Perform capillary electrophoresis according to the
manufacturer’s protocol.
3. Data Analysis:
◦ Use appropriate software (e.g., BLAST, Chromas) to
analyze the generated sequences.
◦ Compare obtained sequences with reference sequences of
EPOR exon 8.
◦ Annotate any mutations or variants detected.
VI. Quality Control
1. Positive Control:
◦ Include a well-characterized positive control in each run to
validate the sequencing procedure.
2. Negative Control:
◦ Include a negative control (e.g., water) to check for
contamination.
3. Documentation:
◦ Record all results, including controls, in the laboratory
information system (LIS).
VII. Reporting Results
• Review sequencing data for accuracy.
• Generate a report outlining findings, including detected mutations
or variants.
• Provide interpretation based on clinical significance in conjunction
with genetic counseling.
VIII. References
• Manufacturer's protocol for DNA extraction kits.
• Established literature on EPOR exon 8 mutations.
• Software manuals for sequence analysis programs.
