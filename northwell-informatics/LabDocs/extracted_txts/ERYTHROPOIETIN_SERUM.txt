Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Generating Results for
Erythropoietin, Serum
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the analytical phase of
generating results for erythropoietin in serum samples. This
SOP ensures the accuracy, reliability, and consistency of
erythropoietin test results.
2. SCOPE
This protocol applies to all personnel involved in the analytical
testing of erythropoietin levels in serum samples within the
laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
◦ It is the responsibility of all designated laboratory personnel
to follow this SOP accurately.
◦ Supervisors are responsible for ensuring that staff is trained
and competent in performing the procedure and maintaining
quality control.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
◦ Specimen Type: Serum.
◦ Specimen Collection: Blood should be drawn into a red top
or serum separator tube (SST).
◦ Processing: Allow the blood to clot for 30 minutes, then
centrifuge for 10-15 minutes at 1000-1300 x g to separate
serum.
◦ Storage: Serum should be stored at 2-8°C if analyzed within
48 hours. For longer storage, freeze at -20°C or lower.
◦ Unacceptable Specimens: Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric
specimens should be rejected.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
◦ Analyzer: Immunoassay analyzer (e.g., ELISA, CLIA).
◦ Reagents: Erythropoietin assay kit, including standards,
controls, and calibrators.
◦ Supplies: Micropipettes, pipette tips, reagent reservoirs,
sample cups, and reaction plates.
6. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation
◦ Ensure all reagents and equipment are prepared according
to the manufacturer's instructions.
◦ Calibrate the immunoassay analyzer if necessary and
document calibration.
B. Quality Control
◦ Run two levels of quality control (QC) material (low and
high) before analyzing patient samples.
◦ Ensure QC results are within the acceptable range provided
by the manufacturer.
◦ Document all QC results. If any QC results are out of the
acceptable range, troubleshoot and resolve the issue before
proceeding.
C. Sample Analysis
◦ Load serum samples onto the analyzer according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Ensure the sample identification matches the laboratory
records.
◦ Process the samples through the immunoassay analyzer.
D. Result Generation
◦ After analysis, review the results generated by the analyzer
for each sample.
◦ Verify that all control runs are acceptable.
◦ Record and document the results in the Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
7. RESULT INTERPRETATION AND REPORTING
◦ Reference Range: Refer to the reference intervals provided
by the manufacturer or validated by the laboratory.
◦ Interpret the results based on the reference range and
clinical context.
◦ Report results through the LIS, ensuring all critical values
are communicated to the appropriate clinical personnel
according to laboratory policies.
8. QUALITY CONTROL AND COMPLIANCE
◦ Regularly participate in proficiency testing and inter-
laboratory comparison programs.
◦ Maintain compliance with all regulatory and accrediting
bodies, including CLIA and CAP.
◦ Document all maintenance, calibration, and troubleshooting
activities in the equipment logbook.
9. TROUBLESHOOTING
◦ Follow the manufacturer’s guidelines for troubleshooting any
issues with the immunoassay analyzer.
◦ If unexpectedly high or low results are obtained, re-run the
sample if sufficient quantity is available.
◦ Consult with the supervisor in case of persistent issues or
uncertainties.
10. SAFETY
• Follow all laboratory safety protocols, including the use of
personal protective equipment (PPE).
• Handle all biological specimens and reagents, including waste
disposal, following biosafety guidelines.
