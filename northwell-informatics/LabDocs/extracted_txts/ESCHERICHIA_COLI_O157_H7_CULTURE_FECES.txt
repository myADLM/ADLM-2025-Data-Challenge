SOP for Analytical Phase of Generating Results for ESCHERICHIA
COLI O157:H7 CULTURE, FECES
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is to
outline the steps and procedures for the detection and isolation of
Escherichia coli O157:H7 from fecal specimens using culture
techniques. This SOP ensures accurate and reliable identification,
which is crucial for appropriate patient management and
epidemiological surveillance.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
All laboratory personnel performing the E. coli O157:H7 culture must
be trained and competent in microbiological techniques. The
laboratory supervisor is responsible for ensuring staff compliance
with this SOP and for providing any necessary corrective action when
required.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Acceptable: Fresh fecal specimens collected in a sterile container
with minimal contamination.
• Unacceptable: Specimens that are visibly leaking or
contaminated, specimens not stored in appropriate conditions, or
specimens received more than 48 hours after collection without
preservation.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Sorbitol-MacConkey Agar (SMAC)
• Cefixime-Tellurite Sorbitol MacConkey Agar (CT-SMAC)
• Eosin Methylene Blue (EMB) Agar
• Tryptic Soy Broth (TSB)
• Latex agglutination test for O157 antigen
• Biochemical identification system (e.g., API 20E, Vitek)
• Incubators set at 35°C and 42°C
• Sterile inoculating loops and swabs
• Sterile saline solution
• Negative and positive control organisms
1. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Preparation and Inoculation
1. Label all plates and tubes with the specimen identification
number.
2. Using a sterile swab, mix the fecal specimen thoroughly and
inoculate onto a SMAC agar plate.
3. Streak the plate to obtain well-isolated colonies.
4. Inoculate a second SMAC plate with the same specimen for
confirmatory tests.
5. Incubate the plates at 35°C for 18-24 hours.
B. Colony Examination and Preliminary Identification
1. After incubation, examine the SMAC agar plates for the
presence of sorbitol-nonfermenting colonies (clear colonies). E.
coli O157:H7 typically does not ferment sorbitol, resulting in
clear colonies.
2. Perform a Gram stain on suspected colonies. E. coli O157:H7
should appear as Gram-negative rods.
3. Subculture suspected colonies onto EMB agar and incubate at
35°C for an additional 18-24 hours.
C. Confirmatory Testing
1. After incubation, examine the EMB plates. E. coli typically
produces dark-centered colonies with a metallic green sheen
due to vigorous lactose fermentation.
2. Pick well-isolated colonies and inoculate into TSB for further
biochemical identification.
3. Perform a latex agglutination test for the O157 antigen on
colonies from SMAC agar.
◦ Positive result: Agglutination indicates presumptive E. coli
O157:H7.
◦ Negative result: No agglutination requires further testing.
4. If the latex agglutination test is positive, confirm identification
using a commercial identification system (e.g., API 20E, Vitek).
D. Biochemical Testing
1. Inoculate the identification system according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Incubate and analyze results as per kit instructions.
3. Confirm the identification of E. coli O157:H7 based on
biochemical profile and agglutination results.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform quality control on each batch of media and reagents
using control organisms: a known strain of E. coli O157:H7
(positive control) and a non-O157 E. coli strain (negative control).
• Document all QC results and take corrective actions if controls
fail.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• All positive E. coli O157:H7 results should be immediately
reported to the ordering physician and infection control.
• Enter the final results into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS) following verification by the technologist.
• Preliminary negative results will be reported after the initial 24-
hour incubation if no clear colonies are seen. Final negative
results will be confirmed after completing the full test procedure.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Negative: No E. coli O157:H7 isolated.
• Positive: E. coli O157:H7 isolated and confirmed.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• False negatives may occur if the specimen is not appropriately
inoculated or if the organism is present in low numbers.
• False positives may arise from cross-reactions in the agglutination
test; confirmatory biochemical testing is necessary.
