5. PROCEDURE
5.1 DNA Extraction
1. Tumor tissue preparation
◦ Prepare the tumor specimen according to standard
histopathological practices.
◦ Ensure ~10-50 mg of tumor tissue is transferred to a sterile
microcentrifuge tube for subsequent DNA extraction.
2. Lysis of Cells
◦ Add appropriate lysis buffer and Proteinase K, vortex and
incubate as specified by the DNA extraction kit protocols.
3. DNA Purification
◦ Follow the DNA extraction kit protocol to purify DNA from the
lysate, ensuring elimination of proteins and other
contaminants.
◦ Use silica columns or magnetic beads as specified by the
kit.
4. DNA Quantification
◦ Quantify the purified DNA using a Qubit fluorometer or
equivalent.
◦ Store DNA samples at -20°C until ready for PCR
amplification.
5.2 PCR Amplification
1. PCR Mix Preparation
◦ Prepare a PCR master mix containing DNA template, ESR1-
specific primers, dNTPs, Taq polymerase, and buffer
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
2. PCR Cycling Conditions
◦ Execute the PCR according to the optimized cycling
conditions:
Initial denaturation at 95°C for 10 minutes
Denaturation at 95°C for 30 seconds
Annealing at 60°C for 30 seconds
Extension at 72°C for 1 minute
Final extension at 72°C for 5 minutes
Hold at 4°C
3. PCR Product Purification
◦ Purify the PCR products using a PCR purification kit.
◦ Quantify purified products for NGS library preparation.
5.3 Library Preparation and Sequencing
1. Library Preparation
◦ Prepare sequencing libraries from the purified PCR products
using the NGS library preparation kit according to
manufacturer’s guidelines.
◦ Include adapters and barcodes specific to ESR1 amplicons
for indexing.
2. Quality Check and Quantification
◦ Perform a quality check (QC) of library using Bioanalyzer/
TapeStation.
◦ Quantify the library using Qubit or equivalent.
3. Sequencing
◦ Load the prepared libraries onto the NGS platform and
follow the standard workflow for sequencing.
5.4 Data Analysis
1. Raw Data Processing
◦ Load raw sequencing data into bioinformatics software.
◦ Perform quality control using metrics such as read depth,
quality score distribution, and adapter/primer contamination.
2. Alignment and Variant Calling
◦ Align the obtained sequences to the reference genome.
◦ Call variants using software such as GATK, SAMtools, or an
equivalent pipeline.
3. Interpretation and Reporting
◦ Analyze the detected ESR1 mutations and their clinical
significance using databases (e.g., COSMIC, ClinVar).
◦ Generate a detailed report including the mutation type,
genomic location, and potential clinical implications.
◦ Review and validate the report for consistency and
correctness.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include positive and negative controls in each PCR and
sequencing run.
• Validate sequencing performance regularly with known reference
samples.
• Follow the laboratory’s standard QA/QC procedures to ensure
data integrity.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
• Review and verify all results by a qualified technologist.
• Report findings according to site-specific reporting guidelines.
• Confirm the release of results in the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
8. REFERENCE VALUES
• Reference ranges and interpretations should be based on the
most current clinical guidelines and genetic mutation databases.
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Ensure recognizing and reporting any limitations in the data (such
as low coverage or ambiguous calls).
• Interpretations should be cautious if the NGS data contains
discrepancies or fails QC metrics.
10. REFERENCES
• Include the latest protocols and guidelines from the manufacturers
of the NGS platform, Library Preparation Kits, and DNA Extraction
Kits.
• Relevant scientific literature and genetic databases for ESR1
mutation interpretation.
11. DOCUMENTATION
• Maintain comprehensive records of all procedures, reagent lot
numbers, and results in the laboratory management system.
• Ensure all steps and findings are thoroughly documented and
traceable for future reference.
