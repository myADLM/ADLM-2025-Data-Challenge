ESTIMATED GLOMERULAR FILTRATION RATE (EGFR) SOP
1. PURPOSE: Estimating the glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)
provides crucial information regarding the kidney function of an
individual. This calculation helps detect, monitor, and manage
chronic kidney disease (CKD), and it is a vital component in the
comprehensive assessment of patient health status.
Responsibility: It is the responsibility of the medical laboratory
scientist or designated staff to accurately perform the necessary
analysis for eGFR estimation and ensure proper documentation in
accordance with this SOP. The supervising staff must verify and
ensure adherence to the protocol.
1. DEFINITION: eGFR refers to the estimation of the rate (mL/
min/1.73 m²) at which the kidneys filter blood, corrected for the
body surface area of the patient.
2. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES:
• Automated chemistry analyzer capable of measuring serum
creatinine.
• Calibrated syringes and micropipettes.
• Centrifuge.
• Refrigerated storages for reagents and samples.
• Patient records including demographic information (age, sex,
body surface area).
1. PROCEDURE:
A. Specimen Collection and Preparation:
1. Serum or plasma sample collection:
◦ Preferred specimen: Serum or plasma collected in a lithium
heparin or SST (serum separator tube) vacuum tube.
◦ Ensure proper labeling with the patient's name, date, and
time of collection.
◦ If specimen is refrigerated, ensure it is appropriately brought
to room temperature before analysis.
2. Preparation:
◦ Centrifuge specimen at 1500-2000 x g for 10 minutes to
separate serum or plasma.
◦ Aliquot obtained serum/plasma into appropriately labeled
tubes for analysis.
B. Serum Creatinine Measurement:
1. Load prepared samples into the automated chemistry analyzer.
2. Perform calibration checks on the analyzer using
manufacturer's instructions and ensure quality control materials
are within acceptable limits.
3. Measure serum creatinine concentration (mg/dL or μmol/L) and
document results.
C. eGFR Estimation:
1. Verify patient demographic data including age, sex, ethnicity,
and body surface area.
2. Select the appropriate eGFR calculation formula based on
patient's demographic information:
◦ CKD-EPI formula.
◦ MDRD formula (serves as an alternative, especially relevant
among specific demographics).
◦ Schwartz formula for pediatric patients.
3. Input serum creatinine value and necessary demographic data
into the eGFR calculator (software or spreadsheet).
4. Calculate eGFR and generate results in units of mL/min/1.73
m².
D. Quality Control:
1. Perform cross-validation checks against known standards and
control samples.
2. Ensure that measurement errors, if any, are documented and
resolved promptly.
3. Evaluate quality control results at regular intervals to ensure
accuracy.
4. REPORTING RESULTS:
5. Confirm eGFR values are calculated accurately.
6. Review and verify results by comparing with patient clinical
history and previous test results.
7. Enter results, including serum creatinine and eGFR values, into
the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
8. Ensure results are correctly annotated, and a smart phrase is
added when necessary, to describe any discrepancies or failed
quality control checks.
9. REFERENCE INTERVALS:
• Normal eGFR: >90 mL/min/1.73 m².
• Mildly decreased eGFR: 60-89 mL/min/1.73 m².
• Moderately decreased eGFR: 30-59 mL/min/1.73 m².
• Severely decreased eGFR: 15-29 mL/min/1.73 m².
• Kidney failure: <15 mL/min/1.73 m².
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS: Refer to guidelines provided by the
specific eGFR calculation formula used for patient-specific
limitations.
