Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Estradiol (17-β-Estradiol)
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized and reliable procedure for the quantitative
determination of Estradiol (17-β-Estradiol) levels in serum or plasma
samples using an automated immunoassay analyzer. The procedure
ensures consistent, accurate, and precise results for clinical decision-
making.
2. DEFINITIONS
Estradiol (17-β-Estradiol): A form of estrogen, a female sex hormone
produced by the ovaries, placenta, and adipose tissue, and critical for
various bodily functions.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory personnel to
perform the procedure and ensure all steps are completed accurately.
It is also their responsibility to report any deviations or issues to the
supervisor.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
a. Specimen Type:
• Serum or plasma (collected in a lithium heparin or EDTA tube).
b. Specimen Collection and Handling:
• Collect blood sample via venipuncture.
• Allow serum samples to clot at room temperature and then
centrifuge at 1500 x g for 10 minutes.
• Separate plasma/serum from cells immediately after
centrifugation.
• Store separated samples at 2-8°C for up to 48 hours. For longer
storage, keep at -20°C or lower.
• Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
c. Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
• Samples with improper labeling or without collection date/time.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
a. Equipment:
• Automated Immunoassay Analyzer (e.g., Roche Cobas e411,
Abbott Architect, or equivalent).
b. Reagents:
• Reagent kits compatible with the immunoassay analyzer for
quantifying Estradiol.
• Calibration and quality control materials provided by the reagent
manufacturer.
c. Supplies:
• Pipettes and tips.
• Sample tubes.
• PPE (gloves, lab coat, and protective eyewear).
6. PROCEDURE
a. Calibration:
1. Prepare and run calibrators according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
2. Verify that calibrators are within acceptable ranges before
proceeding to sample analysis.
b. Quality Control:
1. Run low, medium, and high control materials at the beginning of
each shift, after calibration, and when changing reagent lots.
2. Ensure quality control results fall within the acceptable range. If
results are out of range, troubleshoot and repeat the QC
process.
c. Sample Preparation:
1. Thaw frozen specimens completely and mix thoroughly before
testing.
2. Load prepared serum or plasma samples onto the
immunoassay analyzer according to the instrument’s
operational protocol.
d. Analytical Run:
1. Program the analyzer with the appropriate protocol for Estradiol
analysis.
2. Load samples, controls, and calibrators into the analyzer.
3. Start the run and monitor the process for any error messages or
alerts.
4. Upon completion, review the instrument printout for results and
quality control data.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
a. Data Verification:
• Review each result for validity. Verify that quality control
parameters are met.
• Investigate any flagged or out-of-range results. Re-run or employ
alternative methods if necessary.
b. Interpretation and Output:
• Report results in the laboratory information system (LIS).
• Refer to the manufacturer's reference intervals or institution-
specific reference ranges.
c. Critical Results:
• Alert the designated physician or healthcare provider immediately
for critical values per laboratory protocol.
• Document the communication of critical results according to
laboratory policy.
8. QUALITY CONTROL AND TROUBLESHOOTING
a. Quality Control:
• Run internal quality controls as specified by the analyzer
manufacturer.
• Document all quality control results and corrective actions taken
for out-of-range results.
b. Troubleshooting:
• Address any analyzer error messages per the manufacturer's
guidelines.
• Re-calibrate the instrument if necessary.
• Consult the supervisor if troubleshooting steps do not resolve any
issues.
9. RECORD KEEPING
Maintain detailed records of all calibration, QC logs, patient results,
and any deviations from the SOP. Ensure records are reviewed
regularly for compliance with regulatory standards.
10. REFERENCES
Refer to the reagent manufacturer's kit insert and the immunoassay
analyzer's operator manual for detailed instructions and guidelines.
Ensure periodic review and updates to the SOP in alignment with
manufacturer recommendations and clinical best practices.
