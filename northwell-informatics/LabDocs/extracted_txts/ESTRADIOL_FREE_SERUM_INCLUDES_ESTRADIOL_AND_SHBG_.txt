Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for ESTRADIOL FREE, SERUM (INCLUDES
ESTRADIOL AND SHBG)
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to provide guidelines for the accurate and
precise analysis of Estradiol, Serum including Estradiol and SHBG,
ensuring consistent results are delivered in a timely and reliable
manner.
1. SCOPE
This SOP is applicable to the laboratory staff responsible for
performing the analysis of Estradiol, Serum in the laboratory using
designated equipment and reagents.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
• Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing
and documenting the analysis as per this procedure.
• It is the responsibility of all staff to report any issues or
discrepancies observed during the analysis to the supervisor.
1. DEFINITIONS
• Estradiol: A form of estrogen, a female sex hormone produced by
the ovaries.
• SHBG: Sex Hormone Binding Globulin, a protein that binds to sex
hormones.
1. SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS
• Adhere to all laboratory safety protocols, including the use of
personal protective equipment (PPE).
• Handle all specimens and reagents with care to avoid
contamination and exposure to biohazardous materials.
1. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
• Automated immunoassay analyzer (e.g., Roche Cobas e411)
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Reagents and controls specific for Estradiol and SHBG analysis
• Calibrators and quality control materials
• Disposable gloves and lab coats
• Timer
• Laboratory information system (LIS) for result entry
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Serum specimens collected in SST (Serum Separator Tubes) or
plain red-top tubes.
• Acceptable Specimens: Fresh serum separated from clots and
free from hemolysis.
• Unacceptable Specimens: Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples,
and samples not properly labeled or collected with anticoagulants.
1. PROCEDURE
A) Pre-Analytical Phase
1. Ensure specimens are properly labeled and match the
requisition forms.
2. Allow the blood specimens to clot fully at room temperature
before centrifugation.
3. Centrifuge specimens according to standard laboratory
protocols to obtain serum.
4. Inspect serum for any signs of hemolysis, lipemia, or icterus.
Reject if any present.
B) Analytical Phase
1. Instrument Setup a. Ensure the immunoassay analyzer is within
operational specifications before use. b. Enter the necessary
calibrations for both Estradiol and SHBG according to
manufacturer instructions. c. Load reagents, calibrators, and
control materials as required. d. Run calibration and quality
control solutions to ensure the instrument is functioning
correctly and the assay is performing as expected. Document
results.
2. Sample Preparation and Loading a. Load the serum samples
on the analyzer according to the instrument manual. b. Ensure
samples are placed in the appropriate positions on the sample
rack. c. Enter patient identifiers into the LIS corresponding with
the samples. d. Start the analysis on the analyzer.
3. Analysis Program a. Select the assay program for Estradiol and
SHBG. b. Confirm settings and ensure the assay includes
proper incubation times, reagent mix, and wash steps as per
manufacturer’s protocol. c. The instrument automatically
measures luminescent signals proportional to the concentration
of estradiol and SHBG in the samples and calculates free
estradiol.
4. Result Generation a. After the assay run, review the results on
the analyzer screen. b. The analyzer assigns a result to each
serum sample. Check for any error codes or flags indicating
potential issues. c. If results fall within expected quality control
ranges, transfer results to the LIS.
C) Post-Analytical Phase
1. Results Review a. Evaluate results for any discrepancies or
abnormal values. b. Compare patient results to laboratory
reference intervals for estradiol and SHBG. c. Release
validated results through the LIS after supervisor approval, if
required.
2. Troubleshooting a. If any control results are out of range,
conduct necessary troubleshooting steps as specified by the
instrument manufacturer’s guidelines. b. Document any
corrective actions taken. c. Reanalyze samples if necessary
due to any alarms, outliers, or flagged results.
3. Documentation and Reporting a. Record all calibration and
quality control results in the appropriate log. b. Document all
performed analyses, including any deviations and corrective
actions. c. Report finalized results to the requester as per
laboratory protocols.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform quality control at the start of each shift and with each new
batch of reagents following the laboratory’s QC procedures.
• Maintain documentation of all QC results and corrective actions.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Estradiol: Refer to specific population reference intervals based
on gender, age, and physiological conditions.
• SHBG: Refer to manufacturer’s insert for reference ranges.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's insert and user manuals for the specific analyzer
and assay kits used for Estradiol and SHBG analysis.
• Relevant Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI)
guidelines for hormone assays.
