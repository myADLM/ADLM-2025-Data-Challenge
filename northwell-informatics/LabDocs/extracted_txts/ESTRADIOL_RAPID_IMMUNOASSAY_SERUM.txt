Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Generating Results for
Estradiol, Rapid, Immunoassay, Serum
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the procedure for performing rapid immunoassay
testing for estradiol levels in serum. The aim is to ensure accurate,
reliable, and timely results for patient care.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel trained and certified to
perform estradiol rapid immunoassay testing in a CLIA-certified
laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
All trained laboratory personnel are responsible for following this SOP
precisely and documenting all steps accurately. The supervising
laboratory technologist is responsible for ensuring adherence to this
SOP and addressing any deviations or errors.
4. DEFINITIONS
Estradiol: A form of estrogen, a female hormone produced by the
ovaries. Rapid Immunoassay: A type of assay that uses antibody-
antigen interactions to quickly measure the concentration of an
analyte in a sample.
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred Specimen:
• 1 mL of serum collected in a red-top or serum separation tube
(SST).
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Specimens with gross hemolysis, lipemia, or icterus.
• Specimens collected in anticoagulant tubes (e.g., EDTA, heparin).
• Specimens that have been improperly stored or transported (e.g.,
not kept at 2-8°C if not analyzed within 2 hours).
6. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
Equipment:
• Automated immunoassay analyzer specific for rapid estradiol
testing.
• Centrifuge.
• Pipettes and tips.
• Timer.
Reagents:
• Estradiol rapid immunoassay reagent kit (with control and
calibration materials).
7. QUALITY CONTROL
Internal Quality Control:
• Run two levels of control (one low and one high) at the beginning
of each shift, with each new reagent kit, and when troubleshooting
the analyzer.
• Document all control results in the Quality Control Log.
• Controls must be within the specified range before patient
samples can be processed.
External Quality Control:
• Participate in proficiency testing as required by regulatory bodies.
8. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation:
1. Allow serum samples to clot completely and centrifuge to
separate serum from cells.
2. Ensure serum is clear and free of particulates. Aliquot serum if
necessary and store at 2-8°C if not immediately analyzed.
B. Analyzer Preparation:
1. Turn on the automated immunoassay analyzer and allow it to
warm up as per the manufacturer's instructions.
2. Load necessary reagents, controls, and calibrators as
instructed by the manufacturer.
3. Perform a calibration of the analyzer if required by the reagent
kit instructions or quality control guidelines.
C. Running the Assay:
1. Load patient samples onto the analyzer. Enter the sample ID
and other required information into the system.
2. Start the run according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
3. Monitor the run for any system alerts or errors. Address any
issues as per the troubleshooting guidelines in the analyzer’s
manual.
D. Result Generation:
1. Once the run is complete, verify that quality control results are
within acceptable ranges. If controls are out of range, re-run the
controls and address any issues before proceeding with patient
samples.
2. Review patient results for any flags or errors as identified by the
analyzer software.
3. Validate and release results in the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
9. REPORTING RESULTS
• Report estradiol levels in pg/mL (pictograms per milliliter).
• Critical values (if defined) must be immediately communicated to
the requesting healthcare provider.
10. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Pre-menopausal females: 30-400 pg/mL
• Post-menopausal females: < 30 pg/mL
• Reference intervals may vary based on the specific immunoassay
reagent kit being used.
11. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolysis, lipemia, and icterus can interfere with the assay.
• Patients on hormone replacement therapy or certain medications
may have altered estradiol levels.
12. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's instructions for the estradiol rapid immunoassay
reagent kit.

Procedures.
13. REVIEW AND APPROVAL
This SOP must be reviewed annually and updated as needed. All
changes must be approved by the Laboratory Director.
