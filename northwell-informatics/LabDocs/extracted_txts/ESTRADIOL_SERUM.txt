Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Generating Results for
Estradiol in Serum
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to outline the steps for analyzing
estradiol levels in serum samples, ensuring accurate and reliable
results.
Responsibility:
• Laboratory technicians and technologists are responsible for
performing the analysis and reporting results in accordance with
this SOP.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring adherence to the
procedure and addressing any issues that arise during the
analysis.
1. DEFINITION
Estradiol (E2) is a form of estrogen, a hormone that plays a crucial
role in the development and maintenance of female reproductive
tissues. Serum estradiol measurement is used in clinical settings to
evaluate ovarian function, monitor hormone therapy, and diagnose
disorders associated with abnormal estradiol levels.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred Specimen:
• 1 Serum tube (SST or red top tube)
Acceptable Specimen:
• 1 plasma tube (Heparin, EDTA)
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Hemolyzed samples
• Specimens collected in citrate, fluoride, or oxalate
• Specimens not transported or stored under appropriate conditions
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Automated immunoassay analyzer (e.g., Roche Cobas 6000)
• Estradiol assay reagents and calibrators (manufacture specific)
• Quality control materials
• Shielded pipette tips
• Centrifuge
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation:
1. Wear appropriate PPE including lab coat, gloves, and goggles.
2. Ensure the immunoassay analyzer is calibrated and
maintenance is up to date.
3. Verify that the reagent kits and QC materials are within their
expiration date.
B. Specimen Handling:
1. Upon receiving the serum specimen, check for proper labeling
(patient ID, date, time of collection).
2. Inspect the specimen for hemolysis. If hemolyzed, request a
recollection.
3. Centrifuge serum tubes at 1500-2000 x g for 10 minutes to
separate the serum.
4. Transfer the serum to a clean, appropriately labeled secondary
tube if required by the analyzer.
C. Instrumentation:
1. Load the serum specimen onto the automated immunoassay
analyzer according to manufacturer instructions.
2. Ensure assay-specific reagents, controllers, and calibrators are
loaded into the analyzer.
3. Enter patient information and test parameters into the analyzer.
D. Analysis:
1. Begin the analysis as per the immunoassay analyzer's
operational protocol.
2. The analyzer performs the test and generates estradiol
concentration results.
E. Quality Control:
1. Run quality control samples at the beginning of each batch to
validate the accuracy of the estradiol assay.
2. Verify that QC results are within acceptable ranges as defined
by manufacturer guidelines.
3. Document QC results and any necessary corrective actions if
QC fails.
F. Troubleshooting:
1. If the analyzer flags any issues with the test results or QC
results, follow manufacturer’s troubleshooting guidelines.
2. If any persistent issues arise, notify the supervisor and
instrument supplier if needed.
3. REPORTING RESULTS
• Review results generated by the analyzer for any flags or errors.
• Verify results against QC criteria and patient demographics.
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Critical results (as per laboratory-defined criteria) must be
reported immediately to the physician or patient's care team.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Refer to the specific assay kit instructions for reference intervals as
these may vary based on patient demographics (age, sex, etc.).
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the manufacturer's assay insert for detailed information on
limitations associated with the estradiol assay.
