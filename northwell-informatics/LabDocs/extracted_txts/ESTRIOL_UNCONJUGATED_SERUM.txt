ESTRIOL, UNCONJUGATED, SERUM: Analytical Phase Protocol
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the analysis of estriol,
unconjugated (uE3) in serum samples, ensuring accurate and
reliable results for clinical evaluation.
1. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel involved in the
analysis of estriol, unconjugated in serum samples within the
laboratory.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
• Technologists: Responsible for performing the analysis, ensuring
proper calibration and maintenance of equipment, and adhering to
this SOP.
• Supervisors: Oversee the process, address any deviations from
the protocol, and provide additional training if necessary.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred Specimen: Serum collected in a plain red-top tube or
serum separator tube (SST).
• Volume Required: Minimum 1 mL of serum.
• Stability: Serum should be separated from cells within 2 hours of
collection. Store at 2-8°C for up to 48 hours. For longer storage,
freeze at -20°C or below.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric specimens.
• Specimens collected in tubes with anticoagulants (EDTA,
heparin).
1. REAGENTS AND EQUIPMENT
• uE3 assay reagents (as per manufacturer instructions).
• Calibrators and controls appropriate for the uE3 assay.
• Automated immunoassay analyzer or manual assay kits (as per
availability).
• Pipettes, tips, and other standard laboratory consumables.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation and Initial Setup
1. Daily Maintenance and Calibration: Perform daily
maintenance and calibration on the analyzer as per
manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Reagent Preparation: Prepare reagents according to the
manufacturer's instructions. Allow all reagents to reach room
temperature before use.
B. Calibration Curve
1. Run Calibrators: Prepare and run calibrators according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
2. Acceptance Criteria: Ensure the calibration curve meets the
acceptance criteria set by the manufacturer before proceeding.
C. Quality Control
1. Run Controls: Use both high and low-level controls to verify
assay performance.
2. Acceptance Criteria: Ensure control results are within the
manufacturer's specified range. Document all control results.
D. Sample Analysis
1. Sample Preparation: Thaw frozen serum samples at room
temperature and mix gently by inversion.
2. Assay Procedure: Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for
the specific uE3 assay being used.
◦ For an automated analyzer: Load samples, calibrators, and
controls onto the analyzer as per the instrument’s protocol.
◦ For a manual assay: Pipette the appropriate volumes of
sample and reagents into wells or tubes and follow the
assay’s incubation and wash steps.
3. Incubation and Detection: Follow the specific incubation times
and detection steps outlined by the assay manufacturer.
E. Reporting Results
1. Result Generation: The analyzer will generate results based
on the calibration curve.
2. Review Results: Technologists must review and validate the
results before verifying and releasing them into the Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
F. Interpretation of Results
• Reference ranges and result interpretation should be provided
based on the patient’s demographic data (e.g., age, gestational
age for pregnant women).
• Ensure results are flagged if they fall outside the reference range.
1. QUALITY CONTROL AND MAINTENANCE
A. Quality Control
1. Frequency: Run quality control samples daily and with each
new assay lot.
2. Documentation: Document all quality control results.
Investigate and resolve any out-of-range results before
proceeding with patient sample analysis.
B. Maintenance
1. Daily/Weekly/Monthly Maintenance: Perform daily, weekly,
and monthly maintenance as per the manufacturer’s guidelines.
2. Troubleshooting: Document and troubleshoot any instrument
issues. Report unresolved issues to the supervisor.
3. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results must be reviewed and verified by qualified personnel
before releasing to ensure accuracy.
• Report critical values immediately to the appropriate clinician or
healthcare provider as per lab policy.
• Follow site-specific reporting guidelines for entering results into
the LIS.
1. LIMITATIONS
• Refer to the assay manufacturer’s instructions for specific
limitations.
• Interferences such as hemolysis, lipemia, and icterus may affect
the accuracy of results.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s assay kit insert and calibration instructions.
• Laboratory quality control and maintenance logs.
