ESTROGENS: ESTRONE (E1) AND ESTRADIOL (E2),
FRACTIONATED, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this protocol is to outline the procedures for the
analysis of Estrone (E1) and Estradiol (E2) in serum samples. This
ensures the accuracy, precision, and reproducibility of results,
maintaining the high standards required for clinical laboratory
practice.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of designated laboratory personnel to perform
the analysis as outlined in this procedure, record findings accurately,
and report results in a timely and accurate manner. Supervisors are
responsible for ensuring that staff adhere to the procedures and for
addressing any issues that arise.
2. PRINCIPLE
Estrone (E1) and Estradiol (E2) levels are quantitated using a
sensitive and specific immunoassay method, commonly by
radioimmunoassay (RIA), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(ELISA), or liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-
MS/MS).
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type:
• Serum (collected in a red or gold top tube).
Specimen Collection and Handling:
• Collect blood samples in a clot activator tube.
• Allow the sample to clot for 30 minutes at room temperature.
• Centrifuge the sample within 1 hour of collection at 3000 rpm for
10 minutes.
• Aliquot the serum into a clean, labeled transfer tube.
• Serum samples should be stored at 2-8°C if analyzed within 24
hours or frozen at -20°C for longer storage.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples should be rejected.
• Samples collected in tubes other than the recommended type.
4. REAGENTS, EQUIPMENT, AND SUPPLIES
Reagents:
• Estrone (E1) and Estradiol (E2) calibrators and controls.
• Assay-specific reagents (based on chosen method - RIA, ELISA,
or LC-MS/MS).
Equipment:
• Centrifuge.
• Refrigerators (-20°C or -80°C for long-term storage, 2-8°C for
short-term storage).
• Analytical balance.
• Pipettes and tips (certified for use with clinical specimens).
• Analytical system (RIA gamma counter, ELISA reader, or LC-MS/
MS system).
Supplies:
• Clot activator tubes.
• Transfer tubes.
• Personal protective equipment (PPE).
5. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation:
1. Thaw serum samples completely if frozen, ensure samples are
well-mixed by gentle inversion.
2. Place the appropriate amount of serum into the sample cup as
per the assay kit instructions.
B. Assay Execution (RIA, ELISA, or LC-MS/MS):
Radioimmunoassay (RIA):
1. Add an appropriate volume of standards, controls, and serum
samples to designated assay tubes.
2. Add assay-specific reagents including labeled antigens and
antibodies according to the manufacturer's protocol.
3. Incubate for the recommended time and temperature.
4. Separate bound and free antigens using second antibody or
other separation technique.
5. Measure radioactivity in a gamma counter.
6. Construct a standard curve and determine the concentration of
E1 and E2 in the samples.
Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA):
1. Add standards, controls, and serum samples to the wells of the
microtiter plate.
2. Add specific antibodies and enzyme-linked secondary
antibodies as per the assay kit instructions.
3. Incubate, wash, and add substrate to develop color.
4. Stop the reaction after the specified incubation time.
5. Measure absorbance using an ELISA reader at the specified
wavelength.
6. Construct a standard curve and calculate E1 and E2
concentrations from sample absorbance values.
Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS):
1. Prepare calibration standards, quality control samples, and
serum samples according to the method’s extraction protocol.
2. Perform protein precipitation, liquid-liquid extraction, or solid-
phase extraction to isolate E1 and E2.
3. Inject purified extracts into the LC-MS/MS system.
4. Separate on an analytical column and detect using mass
spectrometry.
5. Use a validated software to quantify E1 and E2 based on the
generated calibration curves.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Include both positive and negative controls with each run.
2. Analyze control samples to ensure that values fall within
predetermined ranges.
3. If controls do not perform within specifications, do not report
patient results and troubleshoot the assay.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Results must be reviewed and verified by the technologist
before reporting.
2. Follow site-specific guidelines for entering results into the
Laboratory Information System (LIS).
3. Address any sample integrity issues using best judgment and
consult supervisors as needed.
8. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Estrone (E1): Reference intervals vary depending on gender and
age; consult specific literature for appropriate ranges.
• Estradiol (E2): Reference intervals also vary by gender and age;
consult specific literature for appropriate ranges.
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• The assay's performance may be affected by hemolysis, lipemia,
and icterus.
• Refer to the manufacturer's insert for specific limitations related to
assay components.
