Title: Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase
of Generating Results for Estrogen/Progesterone Receptor, Semi-
Quantitative Immunohistochemistry, Manual
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedure for semi-
quantitative immunohistochemical detection of estrogen and
progesterone receptors in tissue sections, which are key markers in
the characterization of breast cancer. Results from this assay guide
therapy decisions and patient management.
Responsibility:
• All laboratory technologists performing this procedure must be
adequately trained and competent.
• It is the responsibility of the laboratory supervisor to ensure
adherence to this SOP and address any issues that arise during
the procedure.
1. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE)
tissue specimens submitted to the laboratory for estrogen and
progesterone receptor testing using manual immunohistochemistry.
1. DEFINITIONS
Estrogen Receptor (ER): A protein within cells that binds to estrogen,
promoting cell growth. Progesterone Receptor (PR): A protein within
cells that binds to progesterone, promoting cell growth. Semi-
Quantitative: Providing approximate quantitative determination
without precise measurements. Immunohistochemistry (IHC): A
technique used to localize specific antigens in tissue sections by
using labeled antibodies as specific probes.
1. MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT
• Primary antibodies specific to ER and PR
• Detection system (e.g., EnVision™ system)
• FFPE tissue sections mounted on slides
• Positive and negative controls
• Xylene
• Ethanol series (100%, 95%, 70%)
• Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS)
• Heat-induced epitope retrieval system (e.g., pressure cooker or
microwave)
• Blocking reagent
• DAB (3,3'-Diaminobenzidine) substrate kit
• Hematoxylin solution
• Mounting medium
• Cover slips
• Light microscope
• Timer
• Appropriate PPE
1. PROCEDURE
Note: Prepare all reagents and thaw antibodies according to the
manufacturer’s instructions before starting the procedure.
5.1 Pre-Analytical Phase
• Confirm that tissue samples are properly labeled and match the
accompanying requisition form.
• Inspect the tissue quality and adequacy on unstained slides.
5.2 Deparaffinization and Rehydration
• Place slides in a staining rack.
• Deparaffinize slides by incubating them in three changes of
xylene for 5 minutes each.
• Hydrate slides through a graded series of ethanol (100%, 95%,
and 70%) for 5 minutes each.
• Rinse slides thoroughly in distilled water.
5.3 Antigen Retrieval
• Perform heat-induced epitope retrieval by immersing slides in a
preheated citrate buffer (pH 6.0).
• Heat slides in a pressure cooker for 2 minutes or a microwave on
high for 10 minutes.
• Allow slides to cool at room temperature for 20 minutes.
• Rinse slides in PBS three times for 5 minutes each.
5.4 Blocking and Primary Antibody Incubation
• Apply blocking reagent to cover tissues on each slide to prevent
nonspecific binding. Incubate for 30 minutes at room temperature.
• Drain excess blocking reagent and apply primary antibody (ER
and PR) to the tissue sections.
• Incubate slides in a humidified chamber for 1 hour at room
temperature or overnight at 4°C.
5.5 Detection
• Rinse slides in PBS three times for 5 minutes each.
• Apply the detection reagent (e.g., EnVision™ system) to cover the
tissue sections. Incubate for 30 minutes at room temperature.
• Rinse slides in PBS three times for 5 minutes each.
5.6 Chromogen Development
• Apply DAB substrate to cover each tissue section. Incubate until
the desired staining intensity is achieved (generally 5-10 minutes).
• Rinse slides in distilled water to stop the reaction.
5.7 Counterstaining
• Immerse slides in hematoxylin for 1 minute.
• Rinse slides in distilled water and differentiate in 0.3% acid
alcohol for 10 seconds.
• Rinse slides again in distilled water and blueing reagent.
5.8 Dehydration and Mounting
• Dehydrate slides through 70%, 95%, and 100% ethanol for 1
minute each.
• Clear slides in xylene for 5 minutes.
• Mount coverslips using mounting medium.
5.9 Microscopy
• Examine slides under a light microscope.
• Evaluate and score staining intensity and percentage of positively
stained cells.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include known positive and negative control tissues in each run to
ensure assay validity.
• Document all staining steps and any deviations from the protocol.
• Record the batch numbers of all reagents used including
antibodies, detection kits, and DAB substrate.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Semi-quantitative assessment: record the percentage of positive
cells and staining intensity for each case.
• Provide detailed interpretation based on established guidelines
(e.g., Allred Score).
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
ER and PR status: Report as Positive or Negative based on defined
cutoffs (e.g., a score above 1% positively stained cells).
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Variability in tissue processing and fixation can affect staining
results.
• Interobserver variability in interpretation may occur; duplicate
assessments are recommended.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions for primary antibodies, detection
system, and DAB substrate kit.
• Relevant Clinical Practice Guidelines for Breast Cancer Marker
Assessment.
1. DOCUMENTATION
• Maintain records of all slides, control results, reagent lot numbers,
and any deviations from the standard protocol.
This SOP shall be reviewed and updated annually or as needed to
reflect changes in practice or regulation.
