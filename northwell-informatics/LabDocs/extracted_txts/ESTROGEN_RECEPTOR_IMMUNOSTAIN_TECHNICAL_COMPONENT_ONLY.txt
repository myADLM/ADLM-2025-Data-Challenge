Standard Operating Procedure for Estrogen Receptor (ER)
Immunostain, Technical Component Only
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to provide a comprehensive
guideline for the preparation, staining, and quality control of tissue
sections for the immunohistochemical analysis of Estrogen Receptor
(ER) expression. This applies to the technical component only and
does not include interpretation or reporting of results.
Responsibility:
The designated histotechnologist is responsible for performing this
procedure, documenting all process steps, and addressing any
deficiencies or anomalies noted during the procedure. The lab
supervisor is responsible for ensuring the procedure is adhered to
and for taking necessary corrective actions.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND PREPARATION
Acceptable Specimen Types:
• Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks.
Unacceptable Specimen Types:
• Fresh or frozen specimens.
• Tissue blocks fixed in non-formalin fixatives.
• Specimens improperly fixed.
Specimen Handling and Preparation:
• Ensure all tissue specimens are properly fixed in 10% neutral
buffered formalin for at least 6 hours and not more than 48 hours.
• Embed the tissue in paraffin and allow the paraffin block to
solidify.
• Cut 3-4 µm thick sections using a microtome and place sections
on positively charged slides.
• Air-dry the slides overnight at room temperature or incubate at
60°C for a minimum of 1 hour.
1. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
Reagents:
• Primary Antibody: Rabbit monoclonal anti-ER antibody (clone
SP1).
• Secondary Antibody: HRP-conjugate secondary antibody.
• Detection Kit: DAB chromogen with substrate buffer.
• Hematoxylin: for counterstaining.
Supplies:
• Positively charged microscope slides.
• Cover glasses.
• Xylene.
• Ethanol (graded series: 100%, 95%, and 70%).
• Running tap water.
• Mounting medium.
Storage Conditions:
• Store primary and secondary antibodies as per manufacturer’s
instructions (usually at 2-8°C).
• Ensure DAB chromogen and substrate buffer are stored in dark
conditions at 2-8°C.
1. IMMUNOSTAINING PROCEDURE
Deparaffinization and Hydration:
1. Bake slides in an oven at 60°C for 30 minutes.
2. Deparaffinize in 3 changes of xylene for 5 minutes each.
3. Rehydrate through a graded series of ethanol (100%, 95%,
70%) for 5 minutes each.
4. Rinse slides in running tap water for 5 minutes.
Antigen Retrieval:
1. Place slides in a preheated retrieval buffer (e.g., citrate buffer,
pH 6.0).
2. Heat in a microwave or pressure cooker for 20 minutes.
3. Allow slides to cool in the buffer at room temperature for 20
minutes.
4. Rinse slides in running tap water for 5 minutes.
Immunostaining:
1. Peroxidase Blocking:
◦ Incubate slides in 3% hydrogen peroxide for 10 minutes to
block endogenous peroxidase activity.
◦ Rinse slides in running tap water for 5 minutes.
2. Primary Antibody Application:
◦ Apply the anti-ER primary antibody diluted in antibody
diluent.
◦ Incubate in a humid chamber for 1 hour at room
temperature.
◦ Rinse slides in PBS (phosphate-buffered saline) or TBS
(Tris-buffered saline) for 5 minutes.
3. Secondary Antibody Application:
◦ Apply the HRP-conjugated secondary antibody.
◦ Incubate in a humid chamber for 30 minutes at room
temperature.
◦ Rinse slides in PBS or TBS for 5 minutes.
4. Chromogen Development:
◦ Prepare DAB chromogen working solution as per
manufacturer’s guidelines.
◦ Apply DAB to slides and incubate for 5-10 minutes while
monitoring under the microscope.
◦ Rinse slides in running tap water for 5 minutes.
5. Counterstaining:
◦ Dip slides in hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes.
◦ Rinse in running tap water for 5 minutes.
6. Dehydration and Mounting:
◦ Dehydrate slides through graded series of ethanol (70%,
95%, 100%) for 5 minutes each.
◦ Clear in 3 changes of xylene for 5 minutes each.
◦ Mount with a permanent mounting medium and cover glass.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
Positive Control:
• Include a known ER-positive tissue section as a positive control in
each batch of staining.
Negative Control:
• Use a tissue section treated with an isotype control antibody or
omitting the primary antibody as a negative control.
Quality Assurance:
• Evaluate the control slides to ensure proper staining. Positive
controls should demonstrate clear, dark brown nuclear staining,
and negative controls should show no specific staining.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING
• Inconsistent or weak staining: Verify reagent preparations,
incubation times, and antigen retrieval methods.
• Excess background staining: Ensure thorough washing steps and
the correct blocking procedures were followed.
• No staining in positive control: Check for expired or improperly
stored reagents and repeat the staining with new reagents.
1. RESULTS DOCUMENTATION AND REVIEW
• The stained slides should be logged and documented
appropriately, noting the tissue type, case number, staining date,
and technologist's initials.
