Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Protocol for Analytical
Phase: Generating Results for Estrogen, Total, Serum
Principle and/or Purpose: To determine the total serum estrogen
levels using immunoassay techniques to aid in diagnosis, treatment,
and monitoring of various medical conditions.
Specimen Requirements and Stability:
Preferred/Acceptable Specimen:
• Type: Serum
• Collection: Blood should be drawn into a red-top tube (no
anticoagulant) or serum separator tube (SST).
• Volume: 2 mL of serum is typically required for analysis.
• Handling: Allow blood to clot for 30 minutes at room temperature
(20-25°C) and then centrifuge for 10 minutes at 1000-2000 x g.
• Storage: Serum should be stored at 2-8°C and can remain stable
for up to 48 hours. For long-term storage, freeze the serum at
-20°C or colder. Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Specimens that are hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric.
• Specimens in tubes containing anticoagulants like EDTA, heparin,
or sodium fluoride.
• Specimens not properly labeled or specimens with a discrepancy
between the label and requisition form.
Equipment, Reagents and Supplies:
Equipment:
• Automated Immunoassay Analyzer (e.g., Beckman Coulter,
Roche Diagnostics)
• Centrifuge
• Refrigerator and Freezer
• Pipettes and tips
• Test tubes and racks
Reagents and Supplies:
• Estrogen Total Assay Kit (compatible with the Immunoassay
Analyzer)
• Calibrators and Quality Control materials
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
• Disposable gloves, lab coats, and safety glasses
Procedure:
1. Preparation:
◦ Ensure all reagents, controls, and calibrators are at room
temperature.
◦ Place serum samples, controls, and calibrators on the
appropriate sample racks.
◦ Verify the identification of all samples and documentation.
2. Calibration:
◦ Perform calibration following the manufacturer's instructions
for the Estrogen Total Assay Kit.
◦ Use the provided calibrators and ensure the calibration
curve is valid and within acceptable limits.
3. Quality Control:
◦ Run quality control samples at the beginning of each batch
and at intervals as designated (e.g., every 20 samples).
◦ Ensure QC results are within established ranges before
proceeding with patient samples.
◦ Document all QC results in the QC log.
4. Sample Analysis:
◦ Load patient serum samples into the Immunoassay
Analyzer.
◦ Select the Estrogen Total Assay on the analyzer’s software.
◦ Verify that the correct assay parameters are selected.
◦ Start the analysis, ensuring the instrument functions
correctly and samples are processed efficiently.
5. Result Generation:
◦ Upon completion of the analysis, the Immunoassay Analyzer
will generate the estrogen results.
◦ Review all results for any flagged or out-of-range values.
◦ Repeat assays for any samples with questionable or
unexpected results, if necessary.
Reporting Results:
1. Result Verification:
◦ Check that all results fall within the expected clinical range.
◦ Verify that quality control results are acceptable.
2. Documentation:
◦ Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS),
ensuring all data is accurate and corresponds correctly with
patient identification numbers.
◦ Include any comments regarding sample integrity or
additional notes if needed (e.g., sample hemolysis).
3. Critical Results:
◦ Follow laboratory protocol for reporting critical results.
Contact the requesting physician immediately if critical
values are observed, document the communication, and
retain records.
Reference Intervals:
• Premenopausal (Follicular Phase): 27 - 123 pg/mL
• Premenopausal (Luteal Phase): 49 - 294 pg/mL
• Postmenopausal: <30 pg/mL
Method Limitations:
• Assay limitations include potential interference from biotin, certain
medications, heterophilic antibodies, and high dose hook effect.
Refer to the assay kit insert for detailed limitations.
• Ensure proper handling and storage of specimens to avoid
degradation.
Quality Control:
• Use both high and low control materials to ensure the assay
works accurately across the expected range.
• Document all QC activity and troubleshooting steps taken in case
of failure.
• Perform periodic instrument maintenance as recommended by
the manufacturer.
