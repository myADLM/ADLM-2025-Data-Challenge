Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Estrone, Serum
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this protocol is to outline the procedures for
accurately generating results for the measurement of Estrone levels
in serum samples using immunoassay or liquid chromatography-
mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) techniques. This ensures
consistency, reliability, and accuracy in the results provided by the
laboratory.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for following this
SOP to ensure the proper handling and processing of serum samples
for Estrone analysis. It is the responsibility of all staff to identify any
issues or deviations from the expected procedures and report them
to the supervisor.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• Immunoassay Analyzer OR LC-MS/MS system
• Estrone assay kits
• Serum separator tubes (SST)
• Centrifuge
• Micropipettes and tips
• Calibration standards and controls
• Lab coats, gloves, goggles and other personal protective
equipment (PPE)
• Refrigerators and freezers for sample storage
• Documentation logs and software for data entry and tracking
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
• Specimen: Serum obtained from a blood sample collected in a
serum separator tube (SST)
• Volume: Minimum 1 mL required
• Stability: Serum samples are stable for up to 48 hours at 2-8°C or
frozen at -20°C for up to 3 months
• Unacceptable Specimens: Grossly hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric
samples; samples not properly labelled or lacking collection date/
time
1. PROCEDURE
A) Sample Preparation
1. Ensure that the blood sample has clotted for at least 30 minutes
at room temperature.
2. Centrifuge the SST at 1000-2000g for 10 minutes to separate
the serum.
3. Transfer serum into labelled microcentrifuge tubes.
4. Store the serum samples at 2-8°C or freeze at -20°C until ready
for analysis.
B) Calibration and Quality Control
1. Prepare calibration standards according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
2. Run calibration curve on the chosen instrument (Immunoassay
Analyzer or LC-MS/MS).
3. Analyze quality control samples at multiple levels to ensure
accuracy and reliability before running patient samples.
4. Record all calibration and QC data in the appropriate logs.
C) Sample Analysis
1. Set up the immunoassay analyzer or LC-MS/MS system
according to the manufacturer's instructions.
2. Load serum samples into the analyzer or system.
3. Start the analysis and monitor the instrument’s performance.
4. Document any unexpected observations or deviations during
the analysis. Notify the supervisor if necessary.
5. Upon completion, review semi-quantitative data for accuracy.
Re-run any samples, if results are outside the acceptable range
defined by the quality control limits.
D) Data Recording and Interpretation
1. Transfer the results from the analyzer to the Laboratory
Information System (LIS) and the patient’s records.
2. Verify all results by cross-referencing with QC data.
3. Calculate the concentration levels in serum samples if needed
and mark any critical values.
4. Examine for trends that might suggest instrument or procedural
errors.
5. REPORTING RESULTS
6. Results will be reviewed and verified by a trained technologist.
7. Documentation of the results must include:
◦ Date and time of analysis
◦ Initials of the technologist who performed the analysis
◦ Any comments or notes regarding sample integrity or
procedural deviations
8. Transmit the results to the clinician through the LIS.
9. Critical results must be communicated to the clinician
immediately following the laboratory’s protocol for critical result
reporting.
10. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the assay kit insert or LC-MS/MS system documentation for
specific limitations regarding sensitivity, specificity, interferences, and
reagent stability.

1. REVIEW
This SOP must be reviewed and updated annually or as necessary to
reflect new methods, equipment, reagents, or regulatory
requirements.
By adhering to this SOP, laboratory personnel can ensure the
accurate and reliable analysis of Estrone levels in serum samples,
providing critical information for patient diagnosis and treatment.
