Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase:
Blood Ethanol Analysis
1. PURPOSE This protocol describes the procedures for the
quantitative determination of ethanol levels in blood samples using
gas chromatography (GC) or an equivalent method. The purpose is
to ensure accurate and reliable results for clinical or forensic use.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND ACCEPTABILITY
• Specimen: Blood collected in a grey-top tube containing sodium
fluoride/potassium oxalate to prevent glycolysis.
• Preferred Volume: Minimum of 2 mL of whole blood.
• Stability: Specimens should be refrigerated at 2-8°C and tested
within 7 days of collection. For long-term storage, specimens may
be frozen at -20°C.
• Unacceptable: Specimens received without proper identification
or in tubes other than grey-top. Grossly hemolyzed, lipemic, or
coagulated specimens may be rejected.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Gas Chromatograph with a flame ionization detector (FID)
• Headspace autosampler (if applicable)
• Capillary GC column suitable for ethanol analysis
• Ethanol standards and controls
• Sodium fluoride/potassium oxalate grey-top tubes
• Sample vials and caps
• Pipettes and tips
• Analytical balance
• Volumetric flasks
4. PROCEDURE
Preparation
1. Confirm that the gas chromatograph is calibrated and
functioning properly.
2. Prepare the calibration standards and quality control samples
using ethanol and preserved matrix.
Sample Preparation
1. Verify patient identification and specimen labeling.
2. Vortex the blood specimen to ensure homogeneity.
3. Pipette a volume of the sample (e.g., 100 µL) into a GC vial.
4. Seal the vial with a cap.
Instrument Setup and Analysis
1. Load samples, calibration standards, and quality controls onto
the autosampler.
2. Ensure the gas chromatograph settings are optimized for
ethanol detection:
◦ Injection temperature: 200-250 °C
◦ Column temperature program: Initial at 40°C for 1 minute,
ramp to 200°C at 15°C/minute
◦ Detector temperature: 300°C
3. Start the analysis sequence.
4. Monitor the instrument for proper function and troubleshoot any
issues promptly.
5. Once the analysis is complete, review the chromatograms for
integration accuracy.
Quality Control
1. Run appropriate ethanol calibration standards to create a
calibration curve.
2. Analyze the control samples at low, medium, and high ethanol
concentrations.
3. Ensure control sample results fall within acceptable limits.
Data Analysis and Reporting
1. Quantify the ethanol level in the blood sample using the
calibration curve.
2. Review the results and check for any dilution or interferences.
3. Document the results in the laboratory information system
(LIS).
4. Verify and report the results according to site-specific
guidelines.
Acceptance Criteria
• Results must fall within the acceptable range for calibration
standards and controls.
• Any sample with questionable integrity should be flagged for
review.
• Acceptable blood ethanol concentration for clinical interpretation:
[0.000 – 0.080 % w/v] (subject to individual laboratory rules).
5. LIMITATIONS AND TROUBLESHOOTING
• Gross hemolysis or contamination may affect the accuracy of
results.
• Proper specimen handling and storage are crucial to prevent
ethanol degradation.
• Review ethanol peak for potential coeluting substances.
6. SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
• Document any deviations from the procedure and corrective
actions.
• Ensure compliance with any regulatory or accreditation
requirements.
7. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's guidelines for GC device operation.
• Clinical and laboratory standards for ethanol testing protocols.
• Relevant peer-reviewed articles and technical notes for ethanol
analysis.
By following this protocol, the laboratory ensures high-quality and
accurate results in the analysis of blood ethanol levels, thus
supporting valid clinical and forensic conclusions.
