Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analysis of Ethanol
Testing using Chain of Custody in Blood Samples
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized protocol for the accurate and timely
analysis of ethanol in blood specimens while maintaining an
unbroken chain of custody and ensuring the integrity of the sample
and results.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to the analysis phase of ethanol testing in
blood samples specifically submitted under chain of custody
requirements.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
Laboratory personnel are responsible for ensuring that the analysis is
conducted in accordance with this protocol. They must document
every step performed and uphold all chain of custody requirements to
maintain the integrity of the sample and the validity of the results.
4. DEFINITIONS
Chain of Custody: The documented and unbroken transfer of a
specimen from person to person and location to location throughout
the testing process.
Ethanol Analysis: The process of quantifying the amount of ethanol
present in a blood sample.
Designated Supervisor: The person responsible for reviewing chain
of custody documentation and addressing any issues that arise
during testing.
5. PROCEDURE
5.1 Receipt and Verification of Chain of Custody
• Confirm that the chain of custody form is complete, accurate, and
accompanies the specimen.
• Verify that the sample integrity is intact (e.g., seal is unbroken,
labels match the chain of custody form).
• Document any discrepancies or issues and notify the designated
supervisor immediately.
5.2 Specimen Preparation
• Blood specimens for ethanol analysis should be stored at 2-8°C
and processed promptly to avoid degradation.
• Centrifuge the blood sample as needed to obtain plasma or
serum for testing.
• Ensure that all steps are performed in accordance with the
specific requirements for chain of custody procedures.
5.3 Analytical Method for Ethanol Determination
• Follow the specific test method for ethanol analysis appropriate
for your laboratory’s instrumentation (e.g., Gas Chromatography,
Enzymatic Assay). Refer to the instrument’s user manual for
detailed operating instructions.
Procedure:
1. Sample Identification and Log:
◦ Identify the sample using the unique identifier from the chain
of custody documentation.
◦ Record the sample in the ethanol analysis log, including
date, time, and technician’s initials.
2. Preparation of Controls:
◦ Prepare positive and negative controls for each batch of
samples to be analyzed.
◦ Calibrate the instrument with known standards and ensure
calibration is within acceptable limits.
3. Sample Analysis:
◦ Pipette a specified volume (according to assay instructions)
of the calibrator, control, and patient specimens into
appropriate reaction tubes.
◦ Include random duplicates to assess the precision of the
test system.
◦ Place the reaction tubes in the testing analyzer. Start the
ethanol analysis according to assay and instrument-specific
procedures.
4. Data Collection and Evaluation:
◦ Upon completion of the run, review the data generated for
any outliers or deviations beyond acceptable range.
◦ Conduct troubleshooting and reanalysis if necessary.
5. Recording and Initialing:
◦ Cross-verify results for each sample and control.
◦ Record detailed results on the ethanol analysis log sheet
and initial.
5.4 Quality Control
• Incorporate internal standards and quality control material in each
run to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the analysis.
• Review daily quality control results to ensure they are within
established limits before verifying patient results.
• Document all quality control checks and calibrations in
appropriate logs.
5.5 Reporting Results
• Ethanol concentration results will be automatically transmitted to
the Laboratory Information System (LIS) upon verification.
• A hard copy of the results, along with the chain of custody form,
will be prepared for review.
• Lab personnel must sign the chain of custody form indicating that
the analysis is complete, and all procedural steps were followed
precisely.
5.6 Result Interpretation and Critical Results
• Ethanol levels exceeding the critical threshold must be
immediately reported to the relevant party (e.g., ordering
physician, legal authorities) following proper documentation
protocol.
• If chain of custody has been compromised, results should not be
released, and the issue must be escalated to the designated
supervisor for resolution.
6. DOCUMENTATION AND RECORD KEEPING
• Maintain all chain of custody forms, test logs, quality control
records, and analytical results for a minimum of five years or as
required by regulatory guidelines.
• Ensure that all documentation is complete, accurate, and
accessible for review.

for clinical and forensic toxicology.
8. TRAINING REQUIREMENTS
All personnel conducting ethanol testing must complete initial training
and demonstrate competency through observed proficiency testing.
Continuing education and periodic proficiency assessments are
required to maintain competency.
