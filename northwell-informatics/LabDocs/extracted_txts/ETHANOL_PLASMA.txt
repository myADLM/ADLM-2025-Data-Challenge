Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Analytical Phase for
Generating Results for Ethanol, Plasma
1. PURPOSE
The intent of this protocol is to outline the procedures for analyzing
plasma specimens to quantify ethanol levels accurately, ensuring
reliable and timely results.
Responsibility:
• Designated staff are responsible for analyzing the ethanol levels
in plasma specimens and ensuring all steps are followed
according to this procedure.
• It is the responsibility of all staff members to identify deficiencies
in the analytical process and notify a supervisor.
1. DEFINITION
Ethanol (C2H5OH) is commonly tested in plasma to determine
intoxication levels, compliance with medical treatment, or during
forensic investigations.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
a. Preferred/Acceptable Specimens:
• Plasma collected in sodium fluoride/potassium oxalate (grey top)
vacutainers.
• Samples must be collected, labeled, and transported according to
standard procedures.
b. Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens collected in tubes other than sodium fluoride/
potassium oxalate.
• Specimens that are hemolyzed, improperly labeled, or have not
been properly stored.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Gas Chromatography system equipped with Flame Ionization
Detector (FID).
• Cold centrifuge.
Reagents:
• Sodium fluoride/potassium oxalate plasma.
• Calibration standards for ethanol.
• Internal standard solutions.
• Quality control materials.
Supplies:
• Sample vials.
• Pipettes and tips.
• Labels and logbooks.
1. PROCEDURE
a. Preparation:
• Ensure the Gas Chromatography system is properly calibrated
using ethanol calibration standards.
• Prepare quality control samples to ensure accuracy in results.
b. Sample Handling:
• Centrifuge plasma samples at 1500 rpm for 10 minutes at 4°C.
• Transfer the plasma into labeled sample vials.
c. Sample Analysis:
• Add internal standard to each sample vial.
• Inject a specified volume (e.g., 1 µL) of the plasma sample into
the Gas Chromatography system.
• Run the analysis according to manufacturers’ operational
guidelines.
d. Data Evaluation:
• Review chromatograms to identify and quantify ethanol peaks.
• Compare sample results to calibration curve to determine ethanol
concentration.
e. Quality Control:
• Include quality control samples in each batch to ensure the
accuracy of the results.
• Record and evaluate QC sample results; apply troubleshooting
steps if results are out of acceptable ranges.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results will be documented and reviewed for accuracy before
being entered into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Critical values will be flagged and reported immediately to the
corresponding medical personnel as per the protocol.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Normal plasma ethanol: 0 mg/dL.
• Toxic levels: ≥ 80 mg/dL (0.08% BAC).
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolysis or improper sample collection may lead to inaccurate
results.
• Ensure all steps are undertaken to minimize contamination and
degradation.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If the instrument fails to give accurate readings or QC samples
are out of acceptable limits, perform the following:
◦ Re-calibration using ethanol standards.
◦ Review and follow the troubleshooting guidelines provided by
the equipment manufacturer.
◦ Consult with the supervisor if the issue persists.
