Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical
Measurement of Ethosuximide in Serum
1. PURPOSE: To provide standardized procedures for the analysis,
quantification, and reporting of Ethosuximide levels in serum
specimens.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory staff using this procedure are responsible
for performing analytical measurements of Ethosuximide in serum
accurately and efficiently.
• Laboratory supervisors are responsible for ensuring that all
laboratory personnel are trained in this procedure and that quality
control measures are followed consistently.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY:
• Preferred Specimen Type: Serum obtained from a blood sample
collected in a red-top or serum separator tube (SST).
• Specimen Volume: Minimum 1 mL of serum is required for
analysis.
• Specimen Handling: Allow the blood to clot for 30 minutes, then
centrifuge the tube to separate the serum. Transfer the serum into
a labeled secondary container if needed.
• Stability: Serum samples are stable for 7 days when stored at
2-8°C. For longer storage, samples should be frozen at -20°C and
are stable for up to 3 months.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES:
• High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) system with
UV detector or LC-MS/MS system.
• Certified Ethosuximide reference standards.
• Mobile phase reagents and solvents.
• Serum matrix calibrators and quality control samples.
4. ANALYTICAL PROCEDURE:
Preparation:
1. Calibration:
◦ Prepare a calibration curve using certified Ethosuximide
standards in the serum matrix.
◦ Include at least 5 calibration points across the anticipated
concentration range (e.g., 2-150 µg/mL).
2. Quality Control:
◦ Use commercially available or laboratory-prepared quality
control (QC) samples at different concentration levels (low,
mid, high).
◦ Run QCs at the beginning, middle, and end of each batch of
patient samples.
Sample Analysis:
1. Sample Preparation:
◦ Thaw frozen serum samples to room temperature if
applicable.
◦ Vortex the samples for 15 seconds to ensure homogeneity.
◦ Pipette 200 µL serum into a labeled microcentrifuge tube.
◦ Add 800 µL acetonitrile (or another suitable solvent) to
precipitate proteins.
◦ Vortex the mixture for 1 minute.
◦ Centrifuge at 12,000 rpm for 10 minutes.
◦ Transfer the supernatant to a clean vial for injection into the
HPLC or LC-MS/MS system.
2. HPLC or LC-MS/MS Analysis:
◦ Set up the system with appropriate column and mobile
phase settings.
◦ Injection volume typically ranges from 10-50 µL.
◦ Run the system according to the manufacturer’s
instructions, monitoring for Ethosuximide at its characteristic
retention time or mass-to-charge ratio.
◦ Acquire and process the chromatographic or mass
spectrometric data.
3. Calculation of Ethosuximide Concentration:
◦ Using the calibration curve, quantify the concentration of
Ethosuximide in each serum sample.
◦ Verify the accuracy and consistency of results by checking
calibration and QC sample recovery.
5. REPORTING RESULTS:
• Ethosuximide concentrations in serum are reported in µg/mL.
• Enter and verify results in the Laboratory Information System
(LIS) following standard protocols.
• Reference ranges for Ethosuximide therapeutic monitoring
typically range from 40-100 µg/mL, but always refer to the most
up-to-date clinical guidelines or client-specific instructions.
6. QUALITY CONTROL AND TROUBLESHOOTING:
Quality Control:
• Ensure all QC results are within acceptable limits before patient
results are reported.
• Document and investigate any QC failures according to laboratory
policy.
Troubleshooting:
• If instrument issues arise (e.g., low sensitivity, peak shape
anomalies), follow the manufacturer’s recommendations for
troubleshooting.
• Re-run any samples that fall outside of the acceptable quality
control limits or show signs of hemolysis, lipemia, or other
potential interferences.
7. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS:
• Follow laboratory safety guidelines for handling biological
specimens and chemicals.
• Use personal protective equipment (PPE), including gloves, lab
coat, and eye protection, at all times.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
• Potential for cross-reactivity with other medications or
substances; confirm unexpected results with repeat testing or
alternative methods if necessary.
• Limit of quantitation (LOQ) should be determined during method
validation and considered during result interpretation.
9. REFERENCES:
• Manufacturer’s instructions for the HPLC or LC-MS/MS system.
• Relevant clinical guidelines for Ethosuximide therapeutic drug
monitoring.
• Documentation from proficiency testing and validation studies.
10. REVISION HISTORY:
• Document any changes to the SOP in this section, indicating
dates and reason for revision.
