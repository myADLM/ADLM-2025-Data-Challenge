Standard Operating Procedure for Ethylene Glycol,
Serum Analysis
1. PURPOSE
To provide a detailed procedure for the analysis of Ethylene
Glycol in serum, ensuring accurate, reliable, and timely results
for clinical diagnosis and treatment.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory professionals
responsible for the analysis of Ethylene Glycol in serum
specimens at the CLIA-certified laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory personnel to:
◦ Follow this SOP accurately.
◦ Ensure that all equipment, reagents, and supplies are
properly maintained and calibrated.
◦ Perform quality control procedures as outlined in this SOP.
◦ Report results accurately and in a timely manner.
4. DEFINITION
Ethylene Glycol is a colorless, odorless alcohol used in
antifreeze solutions and other industrial applications. Ingestion
can lead to severe metabolic acidosis and renal failure.
5. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
◦ Gas Chromatograph (GC) or High Performance Liquid
Chromatograph (HPLC) with appropriate detectors.
◦ Ethylene Glycol standards.
◦ Serum separator tubes (SST).
◦ Calibrated pipettes and micropipettes.
◦ Vortex mixer.
◦ Centrifuge.
◦ Analytical balance.
◦ Reagent-grade solvents (e.g., acetonitrile, methanol).
◦ Quality control materials.
6. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
◦ Preferred/Acceptable:
▪ Serum specimens collected in serum separator tubes
(SST).
▪ Serum should be separated from the cells within 2 hours
of collection.
◦ Unacceptable:
▪ Specimens with visible hemolysis or lipemia.
▪ Serum specimens not separated from cells within 2
hours of collection or stored improperly.
7. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Preparation:
1. Centrifuge the SST tube at 3000 RPM for 10 minutes to
separate the serum.
2. Carefully transfer the serum to a clean, labeled storage
vial, avoiding any transfer of cells.
3. Store serum samples at -20°C until analysis, ensuring
freeze-thaw cycles are minimized.
B. Standards and Quality Controls:
1. Prepare ethylene glycol standards in an appropriate
solvent to cover the expected range of concentrations in
patient samples.
2. Prepare quality control (QC) materials at low, medium,
and high concentrations.
3. Store standards and QC materials according to
manufacturer’s recommendations.
C. Instrument Calibration:
1. Calibrate the GC/HPLC system using the prepared
ethylene glycol standards prior to beginning the analysis
of patient samples.
2. Confirm the calibration curve linearity and accuracy.
D. Sample Analysis:
1. Sample Extraction:
▪ Add an appropriate internal standard to each serum
sample, standard, and QC sample.
▪ Vortex each sample briefly to ensure thorough mixing.
2. Chromatographic Conditions:
▪ Set the GC/HPLC parameters according to the
instrument manufacturer’s recommendations specific
for ethylene glycol detection.
▪ Inject a sample aliquot into the GC/HPLC system.
3. Data Collection and Analysis:
▪ Record the chromatographic data for each sample.
▪ Identify and quantify ethylene glycol in serum samples
by comparing the sample peak areas to those of the
standards.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Analyze QC samples along with patient samples at the
beginning and end of each batch analysis to check for
consistency and accuracy.
◦ QC results must fall within the predefined acceptable range
before reporting patient results.
◦ Document and investigate any QC failures before
proceeding with patient result reporting.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ Results should be reviewed and verified by the technologist.
◦ Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
ensuring all patient identification and sample data are
accurate.
◦ Report critical results immediately following the laboratory’s
critical value policy.
10. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Reference intervals for ethylene glycol will depend on the clinical
context, established laboratory guidelines, and recommendations
from authoritative bodies. Consult latest clinical guidelines and
toxicology references.
1. SAMPLE INTEGRITY
• Ensure no significant hemolysis, lipemia, or clotting before
analysis.
• Aliquot and centrifuge samples if sample integrity is in question;
use best judgment for reporting.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Be aware of potential interferences from other glycols or
structurally similar compounds.
• Refer to the instrument and reagent manufacturer’s instructions
for other specific limitations.
1. REFERENCES
• Method validation reports.
• Manufacturer’s instructions for GC/HPLC and reagents.
• Clinical laboratory standards and guidelines.
