1. PURPOSE
To ensure the accurate and timely generation of results for Ethylene
Oxide (EtO) antibody, Immunoglobulin E (IgE) in serum, following
established protocols and quality control measures.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
• The designated staff are responsible for performing the analysis,
reviewing procedures, maintaining equipment, and documenting
all relevant information.
• The staff must adhere to the standard operating procedures,
recognize any issues affecting the test integrity, and report them
to the supervisor.
1. SPECIMEN
Acceptable Specimen:
• Serum, collected in a Serum Separator Tube (SST) or plain red-
top tube.
Specimen Handling:
• Ensure the samples are properly labeled with patient
identification.
• Allow the blood to clot for 30 minutes at room temperature before
centrifugation.
• Centrifuge the serum at 1300-2000 x g for 10 minutes at room
temperature.
• Separate the serum from the cells promptly after centrifugation.
• Store the serum at 2-8°C if testing will be conducted within 48
hours, otherwise store at -20°C for long-term storage.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Grossly hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
• Samples received in inappropriate containers (e.g., EDTA,
heparin, citrate tubes).
• Samples that have been improperly handled or stored.
1. REAGENTS AND EQUIPMENT
• Automated Immunoassay Analyzer calibrated for IgE (e.g.
Siemens Atellica, Roche Cobas e411).
• Specific IgE reagent kits, calibrators and control materials.
• Ethylene Oxide specific antibodies testing kits.
• Pipettes, disposables, and other standard laboratory supplies.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation for Testing
1. Allow all reagents, calibrators, and controls to reach room
temperature before use.
2. Thoroughly mix reagents and samples by gentle inversion
before loading onto the analyzer.
3. Verify reagent lot numbers and expiry dates; record necessary
information.
B. Assay Setup and Calibration
1. Load reagents, calibrators, controls, and patient samples into
the analyzer according to manufacturers' guidelines.
2. Perform calibration procedures as per the manufacturer’s
instructions.
3. Conduct start-up procedures, including priming and any
necessary initialization steps specified by the analyzer’s
manual.
C. Performing the Test
1. Follow the specific protocol outlined by the analyzer's software
for IgE and Ethylene Oxide assays.
2. Ensure all quality control measures are in place and run the
controls before patient samples.
3. If controls are within acceptable ranges specified by the
manufacturer, proceed with testing patient samples.
4. Document any off-normal conditions or errors and troubleshoot
according to the manufacturer's instructions.
D. Result Interpretation and Reporting
1. The analyzer will provide a quantitative measurement for IgE
and Ethylene Oxide antibodies.
2. Review results for any flags or messages indicating potential
issues.
3. Verify results against the control ranges; do not release patient
results if control values are out of specified limits. Repeat the
test after resolving any issues.
4. Document results and any necessary repeat testing, ensuring
sample integrity and result accuracy.
E. Post-Testing
1. Store run data and quality control data according to laboratory
protocol.
2. Properly dispose of used reagents and biohazardous waste
following safety protocols.
3. Clean and maintain the analyzer as per the manufacturer’s
guidelines.
4. Verify that all instruments and storage conditions meet the
necessary post-test procedures and document this process.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
• Use commercially available quality control materials for IgE and
Ethylene Oxide antibodies.
• Establish and adhere to daily quality control testing protocols.
• Record all quality control results and evaluate them against
predetermined acceptable ranges.
• Implement corrective actions and repeat tests if quality control
results fall outside acceptable limits.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results are electronically transmitted to the LIS (Laboratory
Information System) for review and verification.
• The verified results are then reported in the patient's laboratory
report, ensuring they meet criteria for acceptance.
• Any critical results are immediately communicated to the clinician
as per standard laboratory protocol and documented accordingly.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Baseline reference ranges must be established for the specific
patient population. Refer to data from clinical studies or literature
provided by assay kit manufacturers for expected reference intervals.
Results falling outside of these ranges should be flagged for clinical
review.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the reagent kit instructions and analyzer manual for specific
limitations associated with cross-reactivity, interference, or any
variables potentially affecting assay accuracy.

1. REVIEW AND REVISIONS OF PER SOP
This SOP should be reviewed biennially and revised as necessary
based on new regulations, updated technology, or process
improvements.
By following this SOP, laboratory personnel ensure reliable and
reproducible test results for Ethylene Oxide antibodies and IgE in
serum, promoting patient care and safety.
