Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for ETHYL GLUCURONIDE
CONFIRMATION, CHAIN OF CUSTODY, RANDOM, URINE
1. PURPOSE
To accurately confirm the presence of Ethyl Glucuronide (EtG) in
urine specimens received with Chain of Custody (CoC)
documentation, ensuring the integrity of test results for random urine
samples.
Responsibility:
• Designated staff are responsible for performing the analytical
procedures, maintaining Chain of Custody, reviewing and verifying
results.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring adherence to this
protocol and overseeing corrective actions if necessary.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Accepted Specimen:
• Urine samples received with Chain of Custody documentation.
• Specimen should be collected in a sterile container and sealed
with tamper-evident tape or seal.
• Preferred volume: 30 mL
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Samples without Chain of Custody documentation.
• Specimens with broken or tampered seals.
• Specimens that appear adulterated (e.g., suspicious color, odor,
or consistency).
1. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Handling
• Verify that Chain of Custody documentation accompanies the
specimen and is properly filled out.
• Check that specimen seals are intact and label information
matches Chain of Custody records.
• Log the specimen arrival in the laboratory information system
(LIS), including date, time, collector's name, and unique identifier.
B. Initial Preparation
• Ensure all equipment (analytical instruments, pipettes, etc.) is
calibrated and functioning according to manufacturer
specifications.
• Put on appropriate PPE (gloves, lab coat, eye protection).
• Mix specimen well prior to aliquot preparation.
C. Urine Aliquot Preparation
• Transfer an aliquot (typically 5-10 mL) of the urine specimen into
a labeled tube for analysis.
• Secure sample in appropriate storage (e.g., refrigerator at 2-8°C)
if analysis is delayed.
D. Analytical Procedure using LC-MS/MS
• Ensure LC-MS/MS system is calibrated and quality control checks
are performed before sample analysis.
• Prepare calibration standards and quality control samples
according to lab protocol.
• Load the sample into the LC-MS/MS system along with controls
and calibration standards.
• Follow the detailed LC-MS/MS protocol for Ethyl Glucuronide
analysis.
a) System operation - Program the sequence on LC-MS/MS
accordingly. - Confirm run specifications and method parameters are
correct.
b) Data Collection and Analysis - Review chromatograms and mass
spectra for internal standards and EtG peaks. - Quantify EtG
concentration using calibration curve. - Ensure quality control
samples fall within acceptable limits.
E. Result Verification and Reporting
• Verify results against standard ranges for Ethyl Glucuronide.
• Document all results in the LIS, including relevant QC data.
• Print and attach the analytical report to the Chain of Custody
form.
• Sign and date the report for final verification.
F. Result Storage and Communication
• Store confirmed test results securely both in physical and digital
format according to laboratory guidelines.
• Communicate the results to the designated authority, ensuring
compliance with Chain of Custody protocols.
1. QUALITY CONTROL AND CALIBRATION
• Perform and document quality control procedures before each
batch analysis.
• Validate analytical instruments regularly, ensuring calibration
according to manufacturer’s instructions.
• Maintain calibration certificates and logs for all equipment used.
1. ACCEPTABLE TEST LIMITS
Reference Intervals: Ethyl Glucuronide in urine:
• Negative: <500 ng/mL
• Positive: ≥500 ng/mL
1. CORRECTIVE ACTIONS
If QC fails, do not proceed with sample analysis until corrective
measures are taken:
• Recalibrate the LC-MS/MS system.
• Re-run control samples to verify system accuracy.
• Document any corrective actions taken.
