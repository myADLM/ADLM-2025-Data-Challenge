Ethyl Glucuronide (ETG) Confirmation Test Protocol - Urine
1. Purpose:
To provide a detailed procedure for the confirmation analysis of Ethyl
Glucuronide (ETG) in random urine specimens using Gas
Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) for forensic and
toxicological purposes.
1. Specimen Requirements:
Specimen Type: Urine
Volume: A minimum of 30 mL of urine
Containers: Specimen must be collected in sterile, leak-proof, plastic
containers.
Specimen Storage and Stability:
• Specimen must be refrigerated at 2-8°C until analysis.
• Acceptable for up to 72 hours refrigerated.
• Can be frozen at -20°C if analysis is delayed beyond 72 hours.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Urine with high levels of turbidity or contamination.
• Specimens arriving without proper labeling including patient ID,
collection date, and time.
• Specimens arriving in a non-sterile container.
1. Procedure:
Preparation:
• Ensure all reagents, solvents, and supplies are on hand and
within expiry dates.
• Prepare Quality Control materials.
• Calibrate GC-MS according to manufacturer guidelines.
• Thaw frozen samples and bring to room temperature before
aliquoting.
Extraction:
1. Take a 10 mL aliquot of urine sample.
2. Add internal standard to each aliquot.
3. Perform a solid-phase extraction (SPE) using an ETG-specific
SPE cartridge.
◦ Condition cartridge with methanol, followed by distilled
water.
◦ Load urine onto the SPE cartridge, ensuring thorough
contact.
◦ Wash cartridge with distilled water and elute ETG with
methanol.
◦ Concentrate the eluate under nitrogen stream to near
dryness.
◦ Reconstitute the residue in a small volume of mobile phase
(e.g., 100 µL of methanol).
Chromatographic Analysis:
1. Transfer the reconstituted sample to an auto-sampler vial.
2. Set up the GC-MS instrumentation per manufacturer's
specification.
◦ Ensure a proper calibration curve is prepared using ETG
standards.
◦ Ensure the system’s sensitivity meets the legal and
laboratory standards (typically down to at least 100 ng/mL).
3. Inject the sample into GC-MS.
4. Capture and monitor the chromatographic run.
Data Analysis:
1. Collect the chromatographic data.
2. Integrate peak areas corresponding to ETG and internal
standard.
3. Compare the sample peak area against the calibration curve.
4. Calculate the concentration of ETG.
5. Verify that the proper QC values fall within acceptable limits
before accepting results.
Quality Control:
• Utilize two control levels; a negative control (no ETG) and a
positive control (known concentration of ETG).
• Ensure that the calibration curve runs through a range including
100 ng/mL to 2000 ng/mL.
• Validate the results using standardized acceptance criteria.
Acceptable Limits:
• Internal standard recovery: ≥ 70%
• Calibration correlation: ≥ 0.98
1. Reporting Results:
Result Review:
• Results automatically transmitted to the LIS (Laboratory
Information System).
• All results must be reviewed and verified by the designated
technologist before final reporting.
Reference Intervals:
• Confirmed results above 100 ng/mL should be reported as
positive.
• Results below 100 ng/mL should be reported as negative.
Documentation:
• Include patient ID, specimen ID, collection time, analytical data,
and initials of verifying technologist.
• Note any deviations, unexpected findings, and comments
regarding specimen integrity.
1. Method Limitations:
Refer to the manufacturer’s insert and guidelines for potential
limitations of ETG detection. Recognize interference issues, stability
concerns, and critical troubleshooting steps.

• Standard Forensic Toxicology protocols.
• Relevant Urinary ETG Detection literature.
End of Protocol
Ensuring adherence to this protocol allows consistent, accurate, and
legally defensible identification and quantification of Ethyl
Glucuronide in urine specimens.
