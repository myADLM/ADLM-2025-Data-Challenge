Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
ETHYL GLUCURONIDE SCREEN, RANDOM, URINE
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this procedure is to outline the steps
for the analytical phase of generating results for Ethyl
Glucuronide (EtG) Screen in random urine specimens.
2. SCOPE This procedure applies to all personnel performing
Ethyl Glucuronide screening in the laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
◦ It is the responsibility of qualified laboratory personnel to
perform the Ethyl Glucuronide (EtG) screening according to
this SOP.
◦ It is the responsibility of the laboratory supervisor to ensure
all personnel are trained in this procedure and to address
any issues that arise during the testing process.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
◦ Automated immunoassay analyzer (e.g., AU680, Roche
Cobas)
◦ Ethyl Glucuronide controls and calibrators
◦ Pipettes and pipette tips
◦ Urine sample cups
◦ Personal protective equipment (PPE)
◦ Disposal containers
5. PROCEDURE
5.1 Preparation
◦ Ensure all equipment is clean and in proper working
condition.
◦ Verify that reagents, controls, and calibrators are within the
expiration date and have been stored properly.
◦ Prepare and label all necessary reagents and controls.
5.2 Quality Control
◦ Run quality control materials at the beginning of each shift
and after any calibration, reagent change, or maintenance
event.
◦ Use positive and negative controls for each batch of tests.
◦ Document all quality control results; ensure they fall within
the acceptable range before proceeding with patient
samples.
5.3 Sample Handling
◦ Verify that all specimens are properly labeled with patient
identification and collection information.
◦ Inspect urine specimens for acceptable volume and
appearance (specimens should be at least half full and free
of particulate matter).
◦ Mix specimens gently before analysis.
5.4 Analysis
◦ Load the prepared calibrators, controls, and urine
specimens into the immunoassay analyzer according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
◦ Select the Ethyl Glucuronide (EtG) screen analysis program
on the analyzer.
◦ Start the analysis and monitor the process for any errors or
instrument alerts.
5.5 Result Interpretation
◦ Review the analytical data generated by the immunoassay
analyzer.
◦ Determine if results fall within the manufacturer's specified
cut-off levels for positive and negative detection of Ethyl
Glucuronide.
◦ Repeat any tests that show invalid, indeterminate, or out-of-
range quality control results.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ Review and verify results in the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
◦ Report results as "Positive" or "Negative" based on the
established cut-off values for Ethyl Glucuronide.
◦ Include any pertinent comments or observations in the
report (e.g., sample integrity issues, QC failures).
◦ If any critical values are identified, follow the laboratory’s
critical results notification policy to inform the appropriate
healthcare provider immediately.
7. LIMITATIONS
◦ Ensure that no urine samples are adulterated, as this can
impact the accuracy of the screening.
◦ Hematuria or the presence of gross bacteria in the sample
can interfere with the test.
◦ Cross-reactivity with similar compounds may cause false
positive or false negative results.
8. REFERENCES
◦ Manufacturer's Instructions for Use (IFU) for the
immunoassay analyzer.
◦ Relevant laboratory quality control guidelines.
◦ Specimen Collection Manual for Urine Testing.
9. DOCUMENTATION
◦ All analysis, quality control logs, maintenance logs, and
proficiency testing records related to Ethyl Glucuronide
screening should be maintained and be easily accessible for
review.
