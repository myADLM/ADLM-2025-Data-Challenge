Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Analytical Phase for Ethyl
Glucuronide (EtG) Screen with Reflex, Random, Urine
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for conducting ethyl glucuronide (EtG)
screening with reflex testing, ensuring accurate and reliable results
for random urine specimens.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated staff are responsible for implementing this procedure and
documenting results accordingly. All staff are responsible for ensuring
the accuracy and reliability of test results and promptly reporting any
issues to a supervisor.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Acceptable Specimens:
• Random urine samples must be collected in clean, dry containers.
• Preferably, 10 mL of freshly voided urine collected within 6 hours
of voiding.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens arriving in the laboratory more than 6 hours after
collection.
• Specimens received without collection date/time indicated.
• Specimens rejected for significant hemolysis, contamination, or
improper storage during transport.
Note: Refrigerate samples if there is a delay in transportation to the
lab. Ensure samples are brought to room temperature before
analysis.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Ethyl Glucuronide (EtG) test kits
• Urine collection containers
• Refrigerated storage units
• Centrifuge
• Timer
• Documentation materials (Temperature and Result Logs)
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
1. PROCEDURE
A. Pre-analytical Checks
1. Verify specimen acceptance criteria.
2. Bring refrigerated specimens to room temperature.
B. EtG Screening Steps
1. Prepare EtG test kit according to manufacturer's instructions.
2. Completely immerse the EtG test strip into the urine specimen,
removing immediately.
3. Remove excess urine by dragging the edge of the strip along
the container rim.
4. Start the timer.
5. Read each reaction pad at the designated time intervals on the
label.
6. Hold the strip close to the color block on the label and match
colors carefully.
7. Document results, including date, time, and initials of the
individual performing the test.
Note: If there is any discrepancy or unexpected results, perform
troubleshooting as outlined in the kit insert. Record any conflicts and
notify the supervisor.
C. Reflex Testing
1. If the initial EtG screen indicates a positive result above the
threshold:
◦ Prepare for reflex analysis using the same specimen.
◦ Confirm positive results using additional specified
quantitative methods (e.g., LC-MS/MS).
◦ Record reflex testing results and any additional calibrations.
D. Reporting Results
1. Ensure all positive and reflexed results are reviewed and
verified.
2. Report results following site-specific guidelines.
3. Include a “Comment” for any interfacing issues observed, "No
result due to interference," as needed.
E. Quality Control
1. For each new batch of EtG screening kits, perform quality
control (QC) with known negative and positive quality control
material.
2. Record QC results and review against manufacturer ranges.
3. Document any corrective actions taken for QC failures and
immediately notify the supervisor.
F. Reference Intervals
• Ethyl Glucuronide (EtG): Negative <350 ng/mL
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the manufacturer’s kit insert for specific reagent pad
limitations, including potential interferences from medications or
preservatives.
1. CALIBRATION AND MAINTENANCE
• Ensure calibration of analytical equipment is performed per
manufacturer’s guidelines.
• Check the calibration certificate with traceable thermometers.
• Maintain and validate cooling instruments to ensure specimens
remain within target temperatures.

1. DOCUMENTATION
Maintain accurate logs for temperature monitoring, specimen
accessioning, quality control, and result reporting.
1. SAFETY
Adhere to laboratory safety protocols including PPE usage and
appropriate handling of biological specimens.
