STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE
TITLE: Analytical Phase of Generating Results for ETV6 (12P13.2)
Rearrangement, FISH, Tissue
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is to
provide a procedural guideline for the detection and reporting of
ETV6 (12P13.2) rearrangements in tissue specimens using
Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) technology.
Responsibility: It is the responsibility of all trained technical staff to
follow this guideline to ensure the accuracy and reliability of test
results. The designated laboratory supervisor shall oversee the
process and ensure compliance with the SOP.
1. DEFINITION
ETV6 (12P13.2) Rearrangement: ETV6 gene rearrangements are
genetic abnormalities that involve the translocation of a portion of the
ETV6 gene, which may contribute to the development of various
cancers.
FISH: Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization is a molecular cytogenetic
technique that uses fluorescent probes to detect and localize the
presence or absence of specific DNA sequences on chromosomes.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Tissue Sample: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue
blocks or fresh-frozen tissue sections. • Unacceptable: Specimens
with degraded DNA, improperly fixed tissues, or samples without
adequate clinical information.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Microscope slides (positively charged) • Xylene • Ethanol solutions
(100%, 95%, 70%) • PBS (Phosphate-buffered saline) • ETV6
(12P13.2) FISH probe • Hybridization buffer • Water bath: set at 73°C
• Incubator: set at 37°C • Thermocycler: set at appropriate
hybridization temperature • Microscope with fluorescence capabilities
1. PROCEDURE
5.1 PREPARATION OF SLIDES
1. Deparaffinization:
◦ Place FFPE tissue sections (4-5 micrometers) on positively
charged slides.
◦ Dewax slides by immersing in xylene for 10 minutes twice.
◦ Rehydrate slides through a graded ethanol series (100%,
95%, 70%) for 5 minutes each.
◦ Rinse slides in PBS for 5 minutes.
2. Pretreatment:
◦ Immerse slides in citrate buffer (pH 6.0) and perform heat-
mediated antigen retrieval in a water bath at 95-100°C for
30 minutes.
◦ Allow slides to cool in the same buffer for 20 minutes at
room temperature.
3. Denaturation:
◦ Dehydrate slides in graded ethanol series (70%, 85%,
100%) for 2 minutes each and air dry.
◦ Apply 10 μL of hybridization buffer with ETV6 (12P13.2)
FISH probe to the target area.
◦ Cover with a coverslip and seal with rubber cement.
◦ Denature the probe and target DNA simultaneously at 82°C
for 5 minutes on a thermocycler.
5.2 HYBRIDIZATION
1. Incubate slides overnight (minimum of 16 hours) at 37°C in a
humidified chamber to allow probe hybridization.
5.3 POST-HYBRIDIZATION
1. Wash:
◦ Immerse slides in 0.4X SSC (saline-sodium citrate) at 73°C
for 2 minutes.
◦ Rinse slides in 2X SSC/0.1% Tween-20 at room
temperature for 5 minutes.
◦ Air dry in the dark.
2. Counterstaining:
◦ Apply a few drops of DAPI (4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole)
counterstain to each slide.
◦ Mount slides with a coverslip.
5.4 ANALYSIS
1. Microscopy:
◦ Examine prepared slides under a fluorescence microscope
using appropriate filter sets for the applied FISH probe and
DAPI.
◦ Evaluate at least 200 interphase nuclei for the presence or
absence of ETV6 rearrangements.
◦ Record the number of cells with split signals or atypical
signal patterns consistent with ETV6 rearrangement.
5.5 INTERPRETATION AND REPORTING
1. Interpretation:
◦ A positive result indicates the identification of ETV6
(12P13.2) rearrangement in the analyzed tissue specimen.
◦ A negative result indicates no detectable rearrangement of
ETV6 (12P13.2) in the analyzed tissue specimen.
◦ Equivocal results may require repetition or additional
confirmatory testing.
2. Reporting:
◦ Include patient identifiers, specimen details, test results,
interpretation, and any relevant clinical information in the
final report.
◦ The final report must be reviewed and authorized by a
qualified pathologist or laboratory director.
3. QUALITY CONTROL
4. Positive and negative control specimens should be included in
each batch of tests to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the
assay.
5. Regular calibration and maintenance of equipment such as
microscopes and hybridization ovens should be performed as
per scheduled intervals.
6. Document all quality control activities, troubleshooting steps,
and corrective actions taken.
