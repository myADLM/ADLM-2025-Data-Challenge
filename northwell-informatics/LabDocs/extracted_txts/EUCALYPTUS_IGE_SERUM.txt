Laboratory Standard Operating Procedure
EUCALYPTUS, IGE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
To generate accurate and reliable results for Eucalyptus-specific
Immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels in serum samples using an
immunoassay method.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all staff members who are responsible for
performing the Eucalyptus-specific IgE test in the laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for following this
SOP. The supervisor is responsible for ensuring compliance and
troubleshooting any issues.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Accepted Specimens:
• Serum collected in a red-top or serum separator tube (SST).
• Volume: Minimum of 0.5 mL of serum.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, icteric, or lipemic specimens.
• Specimens with external contamination.
• Specimens not appropriately labeled or without a requisition form.
Specimen Stability:
• Room temperature: Stable for up to 8 hours.
• Refrigerated (2-8°C): Stable for up to 7 days.
• Frozen (≤ -20°C): Stable for up to 1 year.
5. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
Equipment:
• Centrifuge
• Immunoassay analyzer (e.g., ELISA reader or
Chemiluminescence Immunoassay analyser)
• Micropipettes and tips
• Vortex mixer
Reagents:
• Eucalyptus IgE reagent kit
• Calibrators and controls
• Wash buffer
• Substrate reagent
• Stop solution (if applicable)
6. QUALITY CONTROL
Internal Quality Control:
• Use multi-level controls provided with the assay kit.
• Run a minimum of two levels of controls (low and high) with each
batch of patient samples.
• Document and review QC results. If controls fall outside
acceptable ranges, do not report patient results until the issue is
resolved.
External Quality Control:
• Participate in external proficiency testing as required.
7. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
• Thaw frozen specimens, if applicable, at room temperature. Mix
gently by inversion. Do not use vortex.
• Label all tubes and plates clearly.
Assay Protocol:
1. Prepare reagents, calibrators, and controls according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Aliquot required volumes of calibrators, controls, and patient
serum into the designated wells/slots of the assay plate.
3. Add the specific Eucalyptus antigen-coated reagent to each
well.
4. Incubate the plate according to the manufacturer’s specified
temperatures and timings.
5. Wash the plate thoroughly using the wash buffer to remove
unbound materials.
6. Add the enzyme conjugate (e.g., anti-IgE-HRP) to each well
and incubate.
7. Perform another wash step to remove any excess conjugate.
8. Add the appropriate substrate reagent to initiate the colorimetric
or luminescent reaction.
9. Stop the reaction using the stop solution (if applicable) after the
prescribed incubation period.
10. Measure the absorbance or luminescence using the
immunoassay analyzer at the specified wavelength.
Data Analysis:
• Create a standard curve using the calibrators.
• Calculate patient Eucalyptus-specific IgE levels using the
standard curve.
• Verify that all QC measures are met before reporting patient
results.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
Reference Interval:
• <0.35 kU/L: Negative
• 0.35 – 0.70 kU/L: Borderline
• 0.70 kU/L: Positive
Critical Value:
• Any Eucalyptus IgE level exceeding normal clinical thresholds
should be flagged and reviewed before reporting. Notify the
appropriate clinician if values are outside the critical limits as
defined by institutional guidelines.
Documentation:
• Document all results, QC data, and any deviation or error in a lab
notebook or LIS (Laboratory Information System).
• Review and verify results before release.
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• False positives or negatives may occur due to cross-reactivity
with other allergens.
• Hemolyzed and grossly lipemic specimens may interfere with
assay performance.
• Proper sample handling and storage are crucial for accurate
results.

IgE assay kit used for detailed information about reagent preparation,
assay procedure, and performance characteristics.
End of Protocol
Note: Ensure that all personnel are trained in this SOP and that
updates are made in alignment with manufacturer’s
recommendations and regulatory guidelines.
