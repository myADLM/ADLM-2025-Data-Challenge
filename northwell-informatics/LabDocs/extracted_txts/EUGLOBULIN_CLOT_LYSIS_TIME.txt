Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Euglobulin Clot Lysis Time
(ECLT) Testing
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to describe a standardized method
for performing the Euglobulin Clot Lysis Time (ECLT) test, ensuring
accurate and consistent results. This assay measures the time
required for the lysis of a standardized clot formed by euglobulin
fractions precipitated from plasma, providing important diagnostic
information related to fibrinolytic activity in patient samples.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
Laboratory technologists are responsible for performing the ECLT
assay according to this procedure. Laboratory supervisors are
responsible for ensuring that technologists are adequately trained
and that quality control measures are properly implemented. It is the
responsibility of all laboratory staff to report any deviations from this
procedure to a supervisor immediately.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Citrated plasma.
• Preferred Collection: Blood collected in light blue-top (sodium
citrate) tube.
• Specimen Transport: Plasma should be separated from cells
within 2 hours of collection and kept refrigerated (2-8°C) if testing
is delayed. Samples must be tested within 24 hours to ensure
stability.
• Unacceptable Specimens: Hemolyzed, lipemic, or clotted
samples.
1. REAGENTS AND EQUIPMENT
• Euglobulin precipitation reagent.
• Calcium chloride solution (0.025 M).
• Clotting tubes or glass capillary tubes.
• Water bath/incubator (37°C).
• Timer/stopwatch.
• Syringes or pipettes.
• Refrigerated centrifuge.
• Quality control samples (normal and abnormal controls).
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation of Euglobulin Fraction:
1. Centrifuge citrated blood samples at 1500 g for 15 minutes to
obtain plasma.
2. Transfer plasma to a clean tube.
3. Add an equal volume of euglobulin precipitation reagent to the
plasma sample and mix gently.
4. Allow mixture to stand at room temperature for 30 minutes.
B. Clot Formation:
1. Centrifuge the mixture at 1500 g for 15 minutes at 4°C.
2. Carefully decant the supernatant without disturbing the
precipitate.
3. Re-dissolve the precipitate in 1 mL of calcium chloride solution
(0.025 M).
4. Transfer the solution to a clotting tube or glass capillary tube.
C. Clot Incubation:
1. Incubate the clotting tube upright in a water bath or incubator
set to 37°C.
2. Start the timer once the tube is placed in the incubator.
D. Monitoring and Recording Lysis Time:
1. Check the tube every 15-30 minutes for clot lysis.
2. Record the time when the clot is completely lysed and the
solution becomes clear.
• Note: The normal ECLT reference range is usually between 90 to
240 minutes.
E. Quality Control:
1. Run normal and abnormal control samples with each batch of
patient samples to ensure accuracy.
2. Document control results and ensure they fall within acceptable
ranges before reporting patient results.
3. If control results are out of range, troubleshoot according to the
laboratory’s quality control guidelines and re-run controls if
necessary before processing patient samples.
4. REPORTING RESULTS
• Report the ECLT in minutes.
• Interpret results based on established reference ranges.
• Comment on any deviations or factors that may have affected the
test outcome.
1. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS
• Handle all biological materials as potentially infectious.
• Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) at all
times.
• Dispose of all waste materials following biohazardous waste
protocols.
1. REFERENCES
• Established laboratory guidelines and protocols for coagulation
and fibrinolysis testing.
• Manufacturer’s instructions for euglobulin precipitation reagents
and quality control materials.
