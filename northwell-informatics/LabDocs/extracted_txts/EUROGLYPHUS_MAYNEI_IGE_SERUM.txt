SOP: Analytical Phase Protocol for EUROGLYPHUS MAYNEI, IGE,
SERUM
1. PURPOSE
This procedure outlines the steps required to perform the analytical
phase of generating results for EUROGLYPHUS MAYNEI, IGE,
SERUM, ensuring accurate and reliable results.
Responsibility:
The trained and qualified laboratory staff is responsible for performing
the analytical procedure according to this SOP. It is the responsibility
of the laboratory supervisor to ensure that staff are trained and that
quality control is maintained throughout the process.
1. DEFINITION
EUROGLYPHUS MAYNEI, IGE, SERUM is a specific
immunoglobulin E (IgE) test used to detect allergic responses to the
house dust mite EUROGLYPHUS MAYNEI.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Immunoassay Analyzer (e.g., ImmunoCAP, ELISA Reader)
• EUROGLYPHUS MAYNEI-specific IgE reagent kits
• Calibrators and controls (low, medium, high)
• Microtiter plates (if using ELISA)
• Serum samples
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Timer
• Plate washer (if using ELISA)
• Reagent reservoirs
• Plate reader (if using ELISA)
• Computer with appropriate software for data analysis and result
generation
1. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
• Ensure that all reagents and samples are stored appropriately
and brought to room temperature before use.
• Prepare the workstation and gather all necessary materials.
• Perform equipment maintenance and checks according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
Sample Preparation:
• Verify the patient's serum sample identification and integrity.
• Aliquot the required volume of serum (usually 100 µL) into the
appropriate well/assay tube.
Reagent Handling:
• Prepare reagents according to the manufacturer’s instructions,
including calibrators, controls, and detection reagents.
• Reconstitute lyophilized reagents if necessary.
Assay Procedure: For ELISA:
1. Add 100 µL of EUROGLYPHUS MAYNEI-specific IgE reagent
to each well.
2. Add 100 µL of serum sample to the designated wells.
3. Add 100 µL of calibrators and controls to separate designated
wells.
4. Incubate the plate at 37°C for the time specified in the kit insert
(e.g., 60 minutes).
5. Wash the wells 3-5 times with the washing buffer to remove
unbound reagents.
6. Add 100 µL of enzyme-conjugate (e.g., anti-IgE-HRP) to each
well and incubate at room temperature for the specified time
(e.g., 30 minutes).
7. Wash the plate again as described in step 5.
8. Add 100 µL of substrate solution to each well and incubate for
the specified time (e.g., 15 minutes) in the dark.
9. Add 50 µL of stop solution to each well to terminate the
reaction.
For ImmunoCAP:
1. Load the serum samples, calibrators, and controls into the
specified positions on the instrument.
2. Follow the instrument's programmed instructions to carry out
the assay.
3. The instrument will automatically add reagents, incubate, wash,
and read the results.
Data Analysis and Result Generation:
• Read the absorbance of each well at the appropriate wavelength
(e.g., 450 nm) using a microplate reader (for ELISA).
• Use the calibration curve to determine IgE concentrations in the
samples.
• For automated analyzers like ImmunoCAP, results will be
automatically processed and calculated by the software.
• Ensure that all quality control criteria are met before reporting
results.
Quality Control:
• Run calibrators and controls with each batch of tests.
• Ensure results of controls are within established ranges. If
controls fail, troubleshoot and repeat the assay.
Reporting Results:
• Enter the results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Verify that all results are accurate and correspond to patient
identification.
• Authenticate the results following the laboratory’s reporting
guidelines.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform quality control procedures with each run to ensure the
validity of test results.
• Use known positive and negative controls, and document all QC
results.
• Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for reagent preparation,
storage, and usage.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If calibrators or controls fall outside acceptable ranges, retest the
controls.
• If problems persist, refer to the troubleshooting guide in the
instrument's manual or reagent kit insert and notify the supervisor.
• Document any deviations or issues encountered and actions
taken.
1. DOCUMENTATION AND RECORD KEEPING
• Maintain records of instrument maintenance, reagent lot numbers,
calibrations, control results, and patient results.
• All records must be stored according to the laboratory’s
documentation policy and be accessible for audits and review.
