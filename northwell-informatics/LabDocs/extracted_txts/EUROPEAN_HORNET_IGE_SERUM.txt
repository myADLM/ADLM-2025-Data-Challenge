Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for European Hornet, IgE, Serum
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to provide a detailed protocol for the
accurate and reliable analysis of IgE antibodies specific to the
European Hornet (Vespa crabro) in serum samples. This procedure
ensures the quality and consistency of test results and adheres to the
required standards of a CLIA-certified laboratory.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all laboratory personnel to follow this protocol
for analyzing European Hornet IgE in serum samples and to
document all procedures accurately. The lab supervisor is
responsible for ensuring compliance and addressing any
discrepancies or issues that may arise during the process.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Analyzer: Immunoassay analyzer calibrated for IgE testing
• Specific reagents: European Hornet specific IgE antibody
detection kit
• Quality control materials: Low, medium, and high IgE
concentration controls
• Pipettes and pipette tips (sterile and disposable)
• Serum separators and centrifuge
• Test tubes and racks
• Personal protective equipment (PPE) including lab coat, gloves,
and safety goggles
• Refrigerated storage for reagents and samples
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen type: Serum
• Collection: Blood should be collected in a serum separator tube
(SST).
• Volume required: Minimum 1 mL of serum
5. SPECIMEN HANDLING
• Once collected, allow the blood to clot at room temperature for
30-60 minutes.
• Centrifuge the SST tube at 1500 x g for 10 minutes to separate
the serum.
• Aliquot the serum into a labeled test tube.
• Store the serum aliquots at 2-8°C if they are to be tested within 72
hours; for longer storage, aliquots should be frozen at -20°C or
lower.
6. PROCEDURE
A) System Preparation:
1. Power on the immunoassay analyzer and allow it to perform
self-checks and calibration.
2. Ensure that all reagents and controls are brought to room
temperature before use.
B) Calibration and Quality Control:
1. Perform a calibration check using the European Hornet specific
IgE antibody standards according to the manufacturer’s
guidelines.
2. Run quality control samples (low, medium, and high IgE
concentrations) and verify that the results are within acceptable
ranges before processing patient samples.
C) Sample Testing:
1. Label the test tubes with the patient’s ID and test details.
2. Using a sterile pipette tip, transfer the appropriate volume of
serum (as specified by the kit manufacturer) to the reaction
vessel or test tube.
3. Add the required reagents to each test tube following the
specific protocol provided in the European Hornet specific IgE
detection kit.
4. Load the prepared reaction tubes or vessels into the
immunoassay analyzer.
5. Initiate the assay run on the analyzer and ensure that the
instrument performs as expected.
D) Result Interpretation:
1. After the assay run, retrieve and review the results.
2. Verify that the analyzer is functioning correctly and that the
control samples’ results fall within the acceptable range.
3. Record the IgE concentration specific to the European Hornet
for each patient sample in the LIS (Laboratory Information
System).
7. TROUBLESHOOTING
If control results are outside acceptable limits or if there are any
technical malfunctions:
1. Recalibrate the instrument and rerun the quality control
samples.
2. Check the reagents for any signs of degradation or
contamination.
3. Repeat the assay for any affected patient samples.
4. In case of persistent issues, document and notify the supervisor
immediately for further investigation and corrective action.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results are automatically transmitted from the analyzer to the LIS.
• Technologists must review and verify the results in the LIS.
• Critical results should be communicated to the requesting
physician immediately, and such communication should be
documented as per lab policy.
• Non-critical results should be reported according to the routine
reporting schedule.
9. QUALITY ASSURANCE
• Participate in external quality assessment programs when
available.
• Conduct regular instrument maintenance and calibration checks
as per the instrument manual.
• Maintain documentation of all calibration, QC, and patient results
for traceability and review.
10. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the European Hornet specific IgE detection kit insert for
detailed information on method limitations, cross-reactivity, and
potential interfering substances.
