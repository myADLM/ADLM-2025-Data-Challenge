Standard Operating Procedure for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Everolimus, Blood
1. Purpose
To provide a standardized procedure for the analysis and
reporting of Everolimus levels in blood samples, ensuring
accurate and timely results.
2. Responsibility
It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory personnel to
perform the analysis, document all steps taken, maintain the
equipment, and report the results as outlined in this SOP. All
personnel must be adequately trained on this procedure and
competent in performing the analysis.
3. Specimen Requirements
Specimen Type:
◦ Whole blood collected in EDTA (purple top) vacutainer
tubes.
Specimen Stability:
◦ Specimens are stable at room temperature for up to 24
hours.
◦ For longer storage, specimens should be kept at 2-8°C and
analyzed within 72 hours.
Unacceptable Specimens:
◦ Hemolyzed, lipemic, and icteric samples.
◦ Samples collected in anticoagulants other than EDTA.
4. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies
◦ Equipment:
▪ Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry/Mass
Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) system.
▪ Centrifuge.
▪ Micropipettes and appropriate tips.
▪ Calibrated traceable thermometer.
▪ Analytical balance.
◦ Reagents:
▪ Standard Everolimus calibration solutions.
▪ Internal standard solution.
▪ Mobile phase solvents (e.g., acetonitrile, methanol,
water, formic acid).
▪ Reagent grade chemicals for preparation of diluents and
washing solutions.
◦ Supplies:
▪ EDTA vacutainer tubes.
▪ Screw-cap polypropylene centrifuge tubes.
▪ Sample vials compatible with the LC-MS/MS system.
5. Procedure
A) Sample Preparation:
◦ Allow blood samples to come to room temperature if
refrigerated.
◦ Vortex the sample gently to ensure homogenous mixing.
◦ Transfer 0.2 mL of the whole blood sample into a screw-cap
polypropylene centrifuge tube.
◦ Add 0.8 mL of the internal standard solution and vortex for
30 seconds.
◦ Centrifuge the sample at 10,000 RPM for 10 minutes.
◦ Transfer 0.5 mL of the supernatant to a sample vial for
analysis.
B) Instrument Preparation:
◦ Ensure the LC-MS/MS system is properly calibrated,
cleaned, and in working order as per the manufacturer's
instructions.
◦ Verify mobile phase solvents are prepared and loaded
correctly.
◦ Perform system check and calibration verification using
standard Everolimus calibration solutions.
C) Analysis:
◦ Load prepared sample vials into the LC-MS/MS system.
◦ Set up the analytical run sequence in the LC-MS/MS
software, including calibration standards, quality control
samples, and patient samples.
◦ Start the analytical run and monitor the system for any alerts
or errors.
D) Data Acquisition and Processing:
◦ Upon completion of the analytical run, review the
chromatograms and mass spectrometric data.
◦ Ensure peak integration is performed accurately.
◦ Compare the analyte and internal standard peaks against
calibration curves to determine the concentration of
Everolimus in the sample.
E) Quality Control:
◦ Analyze quality control samples at the beginning, middle,
and end of each batch run.
◦ Ensure the QC results are within established acceptable
ranges.
◦ If QC results are out of range, troubleshoot the process and
rerun affected samples.
6. Reporting Results
◦ Record the Everolimus concentrations in the Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
◦ Verify the results before releasing them for clinical
interpretation.
◦ If any issues are identified during verification, repeat the
analysis and review QC data.
7. Reference Intervals
◦ Therapeutic range for Everolimus: 3-20 ng/mL (note that
reference intervals may vary based on clinical context and
laboratory standards).
8. Method Limitations
◦ Hemolysis, lipemia, and icteric samples can interfere with
the analysis and result in inaccurate readings.
◦ Ensure all reagents and internal standards are stored and
handled according to manufacturer specifications to
maintain stability and accuracy.
◦ Follow LC-MS/MS system maintenance schedules to reduce
the risk of equipment-related errors.
9. References:
◦ Manufacturer’s guidelines for LC-MS/MS system use and
maintenance.
◦ Standard protocols for LC-MS/MS analytical method
development and validation.
◦ Clinical laboratory standards for the analysis of therapeutic
drugs.
Note: This SOP should be reviewed and updated periodically to
incorporate any changes in laboratory practices, equipment, or
reagents. All changes should be documented, and appropriate
personnel should be retrained as necessary.
