Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for EWING SARCOMA, 22Q12
(EWSR1) REARRANGEMENT, FISH, TISSUE
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to provide guidelines for the analytical
phase of detecting EWSR1 rearrangement in tissue specimens using
Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH). This procedure is crucial
for the diagnosis and management of Ewing Sarcoma.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing
the FISH analysis according to this SOP.
• It is the responsibility of all staff to ensure that equipment and
reagents are functioning correctly and within their use-by dates.
• Staff must also document all procedural steps, observations, and
any deviations from the SOP to maintain accurate and traceable
records.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/Acceptable Specimen:
• Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue block or
unstained sections on positively charged slides.
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Specimens not properly fixed
• Degraded or necrotic tissue
• Tissue not representative of the tumor
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• FISH probes specific to EWSR1 rearrangement
• Tissue processor, embedding center, microtome, and water bath
• Hybridization oven/incubator
• DAPI counterstain
• Fluorescence microscope
• Imaging software for FISH analysis
• Positive and negative control slides
1. PROCEDURE
A) PREPARATION OF SPECIMEN
1. Cut 4-5 μm thick sections from the FFPE tissue block.
2. Place sections on positively charged slides.
3. Bake the slides at 56°C for 1-2 hours or overnight.
4. De-paraffinize tissue sections in xylene, followed by rehydration
through graded alcohols and water.
B) PRE-TREATMENT OF SLIDES
1. Treat tissue sections with a pre-treatment solution to unmask
DNA.
2. Wash slides in distilled water.
3. Apply enzyme digestion to improve probe access.
4. Wash slides in appropriate buffer solution.
C) PROBE HYBRIDIZATION
1. Denature probe and target DNA by applying the FISH probe
mixture to the slides.
2. Cover with coverslip and seal with rubber cement.
3. Denature at 73°C for 5 minutes.
4. Hybridize slides overnight in a hybridization oven at 37°C.
D) POST-HYBRIDIZATION WASHES
1. Remove coverslip and wash slides to remove unbound probe.
2. Perform washes at appropriate temperature and saline-sodium
citrate (SSC) concentrations.
3. Counterstain tissue sections with DAPI.
E) ANALYSIS
1. Examine slides under a fluorescence microscope.
2. Capture images using imaging software.
3. Evaluate the presence or absence of EWSR1
rearrangement(signification chromosomal markers).
4. Document findings, including any images of the hybridized
probes.
F) QUALITY CONTROL
1. Analyze positive and negative control slides alongside patient
specimens to ensure assay accuracy.
2. Record findings and ensure they fall within acceptable limits.
3. REPORTING RESULTS
4. Review and verify results by a qualified technologist.
5. Interpret results with respect to EWSR1 rearrangement.
6. Record all findings in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
7. Generate a report detailing the outcome of the FISH analysis
including images if applicable.
8. REFERENCES
9. FISH Probe manufacturer's product insert.
10. Internal laboratory guidelines for reporting and documentation.
11. Relevant scientific literature and FISH methodology references.
This protocol adheres to CLIA requirements for the accuracy and
reliability of laboratory results. All personnel must ensure compliance
with each step to maintain high standards of patient care and
diagnostic accuracy.
