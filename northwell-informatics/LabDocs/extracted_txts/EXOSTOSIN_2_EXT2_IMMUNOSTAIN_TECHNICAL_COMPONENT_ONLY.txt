Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for EXOSTOSIN 2 (EXT2)
IMMUNOSTAIN, TECHNICAL COMPONENT ONLY
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized method for the technical component of
EXOSTOSIN 2 (EXT2) immunostaining for pathology specimens.
This ensures accurate and reproducible staining results to support
diagnostic evaluation.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of trained laboratory personnel to perform and
document all aspects of the EXT2 immunostaining protocol as
described in this SOP. Quality Control (QC) is the responsibility of the
designated supervisor.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type:
• Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue sections.
Specimen Handling:
• Ensure specimens are fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin for
6-48 hours before processing and embedding in paraffin.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Microtome
• Slide warmer
• Staining racks
• Humidity chamber
• Light microscope
Reagents:
• Primary antibody: Anti-EXT2 antibody
• Secondary antibody: SPECIFICALLY MATCHED FOR PRIMARY
• Blocking solution: 1-3% BSA, appropriate serum in PBS-Tween
• Buffer solutions: PBS (Phosphate Buffered Saline), PBS-Tween
• Detection system: Enzyme or fluorescent-conjugated secondary
antibody
• Counterstain: Hematoxylin or equivalent
• Mounting medium
Supplies:
• Glass slides
• Coverslips
• Forceps
• Pipettes and tips
• Parafilm
• Timer
4. PROCEDURE
A. Sectioning and Slide Preparation
1. Section the FFPE tissue blocks at 4 microns using a
microtome.
2. Place sections on charged glass slides. Dry slides on a slide
warmer at 60°C for at least 30 minutes or overnight at 37°C.
B. Deparaffinization and Rehydration
1. Deparaffinize slides by immersing in xylene, 2 changes, 5
minutes each.
2. Rehydrate through a series of graded ethanol solutions (100%,
95%, 70%) for 2 minutes each.
3. Rinse slides in distilled water for 5 minutes.
C. Antigen Retrieval
1. Perform antigen retrieval as per antibody datasheet
recommendations. Typically, heat-induced epitope retrieval
(HIER) is performed using a citrate buffer (pH 6.0), heated to
95-100°C for 20-30 minutes.
2. Allow slides to cool in the retrieval solution for 20 minutes at
room temperature.
3. Rinse slides in PBS or distilled water for 5 minutes.
D. Blocking
1. Incubate slides in blocking solution for 10-30 minutes at room
temperature to block non-specific binding sites.
2. Tap off excess blocking solution but do not wash.
E. Primary Antibody Incubation
1. Dilute the primary Anti-EXT2 antibody in the antibody diluent as
recommended by the manufacturer.
2. Apply the primary antibody to the tissue sections, ensuring
complete coverage.
3. Incubate the slides in a humidity chamber for 60 minutes at
room temperature or overnight at 4°C.
F. Washing
1. Wash slides in PBS-Tween (0.1% Tween 20 in PBS) for 5
minutes, repeat twice.
G. Secondary Antibody Incubation
1. Apply the appropriate secondary antibody to the tissue
sections.
2. Incubate slides in a humidity chamber for 30-60 minutes at
room temperature.
H. Washing
1. Wash slides in PBS-Tween for 5 minutes, repeat twice.
I. Detection
1. If using enzyme-conjugated secondary antibodies, apply
substrate/chromogen solution according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
2. Monitor staining under a microscope to ensure optimal
development.
3. Rinse in distilled water to stop the reaction when optimal
staining is achieved.
J. Counterstaining
1. Counterstain slides with hematoxylin for 30 seconds to 1
minute, as needed.
2. Rinse in running tap water for 5 minutes.
K. Dehydration and Mounting
1. Dehydrate through graded ethanol solutions (70%, 95%, 100%)
and two changes of xylene, 2 minutes each.
2. Mount coverslips using a suitable mounting medium.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include positive and negative control tissues with each staining
run.
• Evaluate control slides under the microscope to confirm
appropriate staining.
• Record any deviations and corrective actions in the QC log.
6. RESULT INTERPRETATION AND REPORTING
• Only the technical component is performed under this protocol.
The stained slides are then evaluated by a pathologist for
diagnostic interpretation.
• Document the staining procedure, including batch numbers of all
reagents and any deviations from standard procedure in the
laboratory information system (LIS).
