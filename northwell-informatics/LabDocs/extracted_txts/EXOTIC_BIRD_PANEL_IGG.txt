Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for EXOTIC BIRD PANEL
IGG
1. PURPOSE
To establish a standardized process for the analysis and reporting of
Exotic Bird Panel IgG results in a CLIA-certified laboratory.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/Acceptable Specimen:
• Serum: Collect 5 mL of blood in a sterile container with no
anticoagulant. Centrifuge and separate serum within 2 hours of
collection.
• Plasma: Collect 5 mL of blood in a heparinized or EDTA
vacutainer tube. Centrifuge and separate plasma within 2 hours of
collection.
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Hemolyzed specimens.
• Specimens received more than 24 hours after collection without
proper refrigeration (2-8°C).
• Specimens in sodium citrate vacutainers.
• Specimens without proper labeling or collection date/time.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Automated ELISA reader or similar analytical instruments
• ELISA plates specific for Exotic Bird IgG
• Reagents including wash buffer, substrate, stop solution, and
conjugate
• Calibrated pipettes and tips
• Centrifuge
• Incubator maintaining at 37°C
• Results recording software/Laboratory Information System (LIS)
4. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
• Ensure all equipment is calibrated and functioning properly.
• Validate reagents and kits against manufacturer specifications
prior to use.
• Preheat incubator to 37°C.
Testing:
1. Sample preparation:
◦ Bring serum/plasma samples to room temperature
(~20-25°C).
◦ Mix samples gently by inversion or gentle swirling.
2. Plate preparation:
◦ Prepare ELISA plates according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
◦ Pipette 100 µL of sample or control into designated wells.
3. Incubation:
◦ Cover the plates and incubate at 37°C for 1 hour.
◦ Wash the plates with wash buffer 3 times to remove
unbound IgG.
4. Conjugate addition:
◦ Add 100 µL of enzyme-linked secondary antibody conjugate
to each well.
◦ Incubate at 37°C for 30 minutes.
◦ Wash plates again 3 times using wash buffer.
5. Substrate Reaction:
◦ Add 100 µL of substrate solution to each well.
◦ Incubate the plates in the dark at room temperature for 15
minutes.
◦ Add 100 µL of stop solution to halt the reaction.
6. Reading:
◦ Measure the optical density (OD) of each well using the
automated ELISA reader set at 450 nm.
◦ Record OD values in the results recording software.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
Internal QC:
• Run positive and negative controls along with patient samples.
• Verify OD values of QC samples against established ranges.
External QC:
• Participate in proficiency testing programs.
• Validate newly received reagent lots with a 3-sample correlation.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results are automatically transmitted to the LIS.
• Review and verify results, ensuring quality control parameters are
met.
• Report results according to site-specific guidelines.
Reference Interval:
• Positive: OD values > threshold established based on QC and
proficiency test results.
• Negative: OD values ≤ threshold established based on QC and
proficiency test results.
7. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the manufacturers' instructions for limitations of the
equipment, reagents, and testing method:
• Variations in incubation times or temperatures can affect results.
• Hemolyzed specimens can cause interference.
