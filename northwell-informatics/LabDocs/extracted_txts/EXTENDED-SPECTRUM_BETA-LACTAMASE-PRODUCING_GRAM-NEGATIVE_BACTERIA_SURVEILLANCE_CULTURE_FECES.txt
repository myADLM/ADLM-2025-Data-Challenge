EXTENDED-SPECTRUM BETA-LACTAMASE-PRODUCING
GRAM-NEGATIVE BACTERIA SURVEILLANCE CULTURE, FECES
(ESBL Surveillance Culture)
1. PURPOSE
To provide consistent and accurate procedures for the detection of
extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing gram-negative
bacteria in fecal surveillance cultures. This SOP aims to ensure that
all laboratory personnel follow standardized methods, resulting in
reliable and reproducible diagnostic results.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing
the ESBL surveillance culture according to this SOP.
• Supervisors will ensure that personnel are adequately trained and
that all steps are adhered to reliably.
1. DEFINITION
ESBL-producing bacteria: Gram-negative bacteria that produce
enzymes capable of hydrolyzing and conferring resistance to
oxyimino-cephalosporins (e.g., cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and
ceftriaxone) and monobactams (e.g., aztreonam).
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Fecal specimen (collected, received, and accessioned)
• Sterile specimen containers and transport media for feces
• McConkey Agar with Cefotaxime (MAC-CTX)
• Nutrient broth
• Gram stain supplies
• ESBL Confirmatory Test Kit (e.g., combination disk method:
cefotaxime, cefotaxime/clavulanic acid; ceftazidime, ceftazidime/
clavulanic acid)
• Incubator set at 35-37°C
• Bunsen burner or micro-incinerator
• Inoculating loops and sticks
• Sterile pipettes
• Sterile saline or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)
• Antibiotic susceptibility testing materials and equipment
• Quality Control strains (positive and negative controls for ESBL
production)
1. PROCEDURE
A) Isolation of Bacteria:
1. Specimen Processing:
◦ Verify that the fecal specimen has been properly collected,
labeled, and accessioned.
◦ Mix specimens well before processing.
◦ Inoculate a small portion of the fecal sample onto
MacConkey Agar with Cefotaxime (MAC-CTX) using a
sterile loop.
◦ Streak for isolation and ensure even distribution of the fecal
material.
◦ Incubate the inoculated plates at 35-37°C for 18-24 hours.
2. Growth Examination:
◦ After incubation, examine the MAC-CTX plates for growth.
◦ Select colonies that are pink or red (indicative of lactose
fermentation) or colorless (non-lactose fermenting)
potentially suggestive of gram-negative bacteria.
B) Confirmation of ESBL Production:
1. Broth Preparation:
◦ Pick suspicious colonies and inoculate them into nutrient
broth.
◦ Incubate broth cultures at 35-37°C for 4-6 hours or until
visible turbidity develops.
2. Antibiotic Susceptibility Testing:
◦ Perform ESBL confirmatory testing using the combination
disk method.
◦ Inoculate Mueller-Hinton agar (MHA) plate evenly with the
broth culture.
◦ Place antibiotic disks (cefotaxime, cefotaxime/clavulanic
acid; ceftazidime, ceftazidime/clavulanic acid) on the
inoculated MHA plate.
◦ Incubate at 35-37°C for 18-24 hours.
3. Result Interpretation:
◦ Measure the zones of inhibition around each antibiotic disk.
◦ Compare the zone sizes for cefotaxime versus cefotaxime/
clavulanic acid and ceftazidime versus ceftazidime/
clavulanic acid.
▪ A ≥ 5 mm increase in zone diameter for the antibiotic
combined with clavulanic acid compared to the antibiotic
alone indicates ESBL production.
◦ Record and report results.
C) Quality Control:
Perform quality control testing using known ESBL-producing and
non-producing strains to ensure that the culture media, reagents, and
procedures are working correctly.
5. REPORTING RESULTS:
• Document and verify test results in the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
• Positive results should be reported according to site-specific
guidelines for ESBL notifications.
• Include a comment indicating the presence of ESBL-producing
gram-negative bacteria and noting the specific organism
identified.
6. REFERENCES:
• CLSI (Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute) guidelines for
ESBL detection.
• Manufacturer’s instructions for ESBL confirmatory test disks.
• Relevant peer-reviewed articles and standard microbiology
textbooks.
7. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
• False negatives may occur if the antimicrobial concentration in the
MAC-CTX agar is not optimal or if improper incubation conditions
are used.
• Resistance mechanisms other than ESBL, such as AmpC beta-
lactamases or carbapenemases, will not be detected using this
method and require further confirmatory testing.
