Standard Operating Procedure: Analytical Phase for Generating
Results for Extractable Nuclear Antigens (ENA) Screen, Serum
1. PURPOSE
This document provides a detailed protocol for the analytical phase of
generating results for the Extractable Nuclear Antigens (ENA) Screen
in serum specimens. The ENA Screen is used to detect antibodies
against a group of antigens located in the cell nucleus, aiding in the
diagnosis of autoimmune diseases.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel who are responsible for
the analysis and result generation of the ENA Screen in a CLIA-
certified laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Laboratory personnel: Perform the ENA Screen analysis
according to this protocol.
• Supervisors: Ensure adherence to the procedure and address any
deviations or issues.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Acceptable Specimens:
• 5-10 mL of venous blood collected in a serum separator tube
(SST)
• Specimens must be transported to the lab within 2 hours or
refrigerated at 2-8°C for not more than 48 hours if stored before
testing
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric specimens
• Specimens collected in tubes containing anticoagulants (EDTA,
heparin)
• Specimens that have not been properly labeled or identified
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Automated immunoassay analyzer (e.g., ELISA,
Chemiluminescent Immunoassay)
• ENA screening reagent kit
• Calibrators and controls (positive and negative)
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Incubators set at required specific temperatures for analysis
• Microplate reader
• Deionized water
• Laboratory timer
6. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation:
1. Allow all reagents, calibrators, and controls to reach room
temperature.
2. Prepare microtiter plates if using an ELISA method, according
to the manufacturer's instructions.
B. Calibration:
1. Run calibrators and ensure the system is capable of generating
valid results.
2. Verify calibration using the provided calibrators at the start of
each run or as recommended by the manufacturer.
C. Quality Control:
1. Run positive and negative quality control samples at the
beginning of each batch.
2. Ensure that the results of the quality controls fall within the
established acceptable ranges before proceeding with patient
samples.
3. Document all QC results in the QC log.
D. Sample Analysis:
1. Label microtiter plates or test tubes according to the sample
processor or assay plate map.
2. Pipette the appropriate volume of patient serum, calibrators,
and controls into the assigned wells or tubes.
3. Add the ENA reagent and mix gently by tapping or using a
shaker (according to manufacturer's protocol).
4. Incubate the plates/tubes/strips at the specified temperature
and incubation time as per the assay instructions.
5. Wash the wells thoroughly to remove unbound antibodies if
using ELISA. Follow the specific washing protocol provided in
the reagent kit.
6. Add substrate solution to each well and incubate for the
required development time.
7. Stop the reaction using the stop solution provided in the kit.
8. Measure the absorbance or chemiluminescence of the wells
using the microplate reader.
E. Reading and Interpretation:
1. Record optical density (OD) values of each well or the
corresponding signals for chemiluminescent assays.
2. Calculate the antibody titers or units based on the standard
curve generated using calibrators.
3. Interpret the results according to the kit’s reference values and
guidelines. Determine the presence or absence of ENA
antibodies in the serum samples.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
• Transmit generated results to the Laboratory Information System
(LIS) and verify for accuracy.
• Review and validate the results by a trained technologist before
releasing them.
• Report results according to laboratory reporting guidelines,
ensuring critical values are communicated promptly.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
• Ensure all equipment is calibrated and maintained as per
manufacturer specifications.
• Run routine internal and external quality control tests.
• Participate in proficiency testing to maintain high standards and
accuracy.
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• The sensitivity and specificity of the ENA Screen can vary
depending on the assay kit used.
• False positives may occur due to non-specific binding or cross-
reactivity.
• Refer to manufacturer instructions for specific limitations inherent
to the kit.
10. REFERENCES
Refer to the ENA Screening Reagent Kit inserts and the laboratory’s
quality management system for specific instructions and detailed
procedural guidelines.
11. DOCUMENTATION
Maintain documentation of all calibrations, quality control results, and
patient sample results according to laboratory policy.
Note: This procedure is a template and should be adapted according
to specific laboratory facilities, equipment, and regulatory
requirements. Always adhere to manufacturer instructions and
laboratory safety protocols.
