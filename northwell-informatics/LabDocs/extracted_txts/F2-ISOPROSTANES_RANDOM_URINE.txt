Protocol for the Analytical Phase of F2-Isoprostanes, Random,
Urine
1. PURPOSE
To provide a detailed, standardized procedure for the analysis of F2-
Isoprostanes in random urine samples to ensure accuracy, precision,
and reliability of results
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of designated personnel to follow the procedure
accurately and perform the required analysis of urine samples for the
determination of F2-Isoprostanes. The supervising personnel is
responsible for overseeing the analysis and ensuring compliance with
this SOP.
1. DEFINITION
F2-isoprostanes are a series of compounds produced by the non-
enzymatic free radical-catalyzed peroxidation of arachidonic acid,
used as biomarkers of oxidative stress.
1. SPECIMEN
Acceptable Specimen:
• Random urine sample collected in a sterile container, without any
preservatives.
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Specimens collected with preservatives.
• Specimens not properly labeled with collection time and date.
• Specimens with visible contamination or hemolysis.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) System
or Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) System
• Centrifuge
• Sterile urine collection containers
• Pipettes and tips
• F2-isoprostane assay reagents and internal standards
• Control and calibration standards
• Analytical grade solvents (e.g., methanol, acetonitrile)
• Deionized water
• Analytical balance
• Vortex mixer
• Disposable test tubes and microcentrifuge tubes
1. PROCEDURE
A) Pre-Analytical Processing:
1. Verify that the urine sample is suitable for analysis based on the
criteria outlined above.
2. Mix the urine sample gently to ensure uniformity.
3. Aliquot the appropriate volume of urine (e.g., 1 mL) into a
labeled microcentrifuge tube.
4. Centrifuge the sample at 1500 g for 10 minutes to remove
particulate matter.
5. Transfer the supernatant to a clean microcentrifuge tube for
further processing.
B) Derivatization (if required):
1. Add the appropriate derivatizing agent to the urine sample as
necessary for the chosen analytical method (e.g., for GC-MS
analysis).
2. Incubate the sample under the conditions specified by the
derivatizing agent manufacturer.
C) Extraction and Cleanup:
1. Add an internal standard to the urine supernatant.
2. Perform liquid-liquid extraction or solid phase extraction (SPE)
to isolate F2-Isoprostanes:
◦ For SPE: Condition the cartridge with methanol followed by
water. Load the urine sample onto the cartridge, wash with
water, and elute the analytes with an appropriate solvent.
◦ For liquid-liquid extraction: Add an appropriate organic
solvent to the urine sample, vortex for 2 minutes, and
centrifuge. Transfer the organic layer to a clean test tube.
3. Evaporate the solvent under a stream of nitrogen or using a
vacuum evaporator to dryness.
D) Reconstitution:
1. Reconstitute the dried extract in an appropriate solvent (e.g.,
methanol) suitable for LC-MS/MS or GC-MS analysis.
2. Transfer the reconstituted sample to an auto-sampler vial.
E) Instrumental Analysis:
1. Set up the LC-MS/MS or GC-MS system according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
2. Perform calibration using standard solutions of known
concentrations of F2-Isoprostanes.
3. Run quality control samples to ensure instrument performance
and accuracy.
4. Inject the prepared urine samples into the LC-MS/MS or GC-
MS system.
5. Analyze the data, recording the retention times and peak areas
for the F2-Isoprostanes and internal standard.
6. QUALITY CONTROL:
7. Run controls and blanks at the beginning and end of each
batch to ensure system suitability.
8. Evaluate control samples to ensure that the results fall within
the acceptable range.
9. Document all quality control measures and perform any
necessary corrective actions before proceeding with sample
analysis.
10. REPORTING RESULTS:
11. Analyze the data and calculate the concentration of F2-
Isoprostanes in the urine samples using the internal standard
method.
12. All results should be expressed in nanograms per milliliter (ng/
mL) or other appropriate units.
13. Verify results for consistency and accuracy before reporting.
14. Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS) and
generate reports for clinical interpretation.
15. REFERENCE INTERVALS:
Reference intervals for F2-Isoprostanes may vary based on the
population and laboratory. Use established reference ranges and
verify periodically.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
Refer to specific method limitations as indicated in the package
insert/reference materials for LC-MS/MS or GC-MS analysis
techniques.

verification, quality control results, instrument calibration, and final
results.
NOTE:
This protocol should be reviewed periodically and updated to reflect
any changes in equipment, reagents, or methodologies. Compliance
with all regulatory requirements is mandatory.
