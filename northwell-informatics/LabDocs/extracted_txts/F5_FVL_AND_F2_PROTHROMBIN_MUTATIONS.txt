1. PURPOSE
This procedure provides an effective and systematic approach for
generating results for F5 (Factor V Leiden) and F2 (Prothrombin)
mutations to ensure accurate, timely results for clinical decision-
making.
Responsibility:
Qualified medical laboratory staff are responsible for performing the
analysis according to this procedure. It is the responsibility of the staff
to report any deficiencies in the process which may affect test results
to the supervisor.
It is the responsibility of the supervisor to ensure that this procedure
is followed correctly and any required corrective actions are taken
promptly.
1. DEFINITION
This SOP covers the extraction, amplification, detection, and
interpretation of genetic mutations in the F5 (Factor V Leiden) and F2
(Prothrombin) genes using validated molecular techniques.
1. PROCEDURE
The following steps shall be followed for processing samples to
identify the presence of F5 (Factor V Leiden) and F2 (Prothrombin)
mutations.
Sample Requirements:
• Peripheral blood collected in EDTA anticoagulant tubes.
• Samples must be stored at 2–8°C if not processed immediately.
Maximum storage time before processing should not exceed 7
days.
Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies:
• EDTA anticoagulant tubes
• DNA extraction kits
• PCR reagents (primers, Taq polymerase, nucleotides, etc.)
• Thermal cycler
• Gel electrophoresis apparatus, agarose gels, and staining
solution
• Real-time PCR system (optional)
• Positive and Negative controls (genomic DNA known to contain/
not contain mutations)
• Laboratory documentation materials
Procedure Steps:
A) DNA Extraction:
1. Use the DNA extraction kit to transfer the volume specified in
the kit manual from each EDTA tube to separate
microcentrifuge tubes.
2. Follow the specified extraction protocol provided in the DNA
extraction kit to isolate DNA from the blood samples.
3. Quantitate DNA and assess purity using spectrophotometry or
another appropriate method.
4. Store isolated DNA at –20°C or proceed directly to
amplification.
B) PCR Amplification:
1. Prepare the PCR reaction master mix according to
manufacturer instructions, adding primers specific to F5 and F2
mutation sites.
2. Add the extracted DNA to the master mix and transfer to the
thermal cycler.
3. Run the thermal cycler using optimized cycling conditions for F5
and F2 mutation detection. Conditions include denaturation,
annealing, and extension phases.
C) Gel Electrophoresis (if applicable):
1. Prepare agarose gel and pour into the electrophoresis
apparatus.
2. Load PCR products and appropriate molecular markers into
wells of the agarose gel.
3. Run gel electrophoresis at the specified voltage until DNA
fragments are adequately separated.
4. Stain the gel using a suitable DNA staining solution (e.g.,
ethidium bromide) and visualize under UV light.
D) Real-Time PCR (optional):
1. Prepare the real-time PCR master mix with specific probes for
F5 and F2 mutations.
2. Set up the reactions in the real-time PCR system and run
cycles according to optimized protocol.
3. Analyze results using software to interpret the presence or
absence of mutations.
E) Interpretation and Reporting:
1. Compare gel electrophoresis bands to control samples to
determine mutation presence. For real-time PCR, review
amplification curves and related software output.
2. Record all findings, ensuring completeness and accuracy.
3. Results must be reviewed by the responsible medical
technologist for consistency and any anomalies.
4. Report results according to the site-specific reporting
guidelines. Include relevant annotations and interpretative
comments.
Quality Control:
1. Include positive and negative controls with each batch of PCR
reactions to ensure assay performance.
2. Regular calibration of equipment and instruments, adherence to
maintenance schedules, and review of control results is
mandatory.
3. Reference ranges and acceptable limits for results
interpretation are defined in manufacturer inserts for PCR
reagents.
