Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase:
FABRY DISEASE, FULL GENE ANALYSIS, VARIES
1. PURPOSE
This SOP provides detailed instructions for conducting a full gene
analysis for Fabry disease. Fabry disease (OMIM #301500) is an X-
linked recessive disorder caused by mutations in the GLA gene. This
protocol aims to ensure accurate and reliable sequencing and
interpretation of the GLA gene to detect pathogenic variants
associated with Fabry disease.
Responsibility:
• It is the responsibility of all assigned laboratory staff to adhere to
this protocol to ensure proper analysis, documentation, and
reporting of results.
• Supervisors must ensure the proper training of staff and the
availability of necessary equipment and reagents.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND PREPARATION
Acceptable Specimens:
• Peripheral blood in EDTA anticoagulated tubes (5-10 mL).
• Extracted genomic DNA with a minimum concentration of 50 ng/
µL.
Specimen Stability:
• Blood samples are stable at 4°C for up to 72 hours.
• Extracted DNA is stable at -20°C for long-term storage.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Clotted blood samples.
• Samples with insufficient volume.
• Specimens not properly labeled or without accompanying
requisition form.
3. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
Equipment:
• DNA extraction kits/systems.
• PCR thermocycler.
• Gel electrophoresis apparatus.
• Sequencing platform (e.g., Sanger sequencer or NGS
instrument).
• Computer with bioinformatics software for data analysis.
Reagents:
• DNA extraction reagents.
• PCR reagents (primers, dNTPs, Taq polymerase).
• Sequencing reagents and kits.
• Consumables: Tubes, pipettes, tips.
• Nucleic acid stain (e.g., ethidium bromide or SYBR Green).
4. PROCEDURE
A. DNA Extraction:
• Extract genomic DNA from the peripheral blood using a
commercial DNA extraction kit per the manufacturer’s instructions.
• Assess the quality and quantity of DNA using spectrophotometry
and gel electrophoresis.
B. PCR Amplification:
• Amplify all exons and flanking intronic regions of the GLA gene
with specific primers.
• Prepare the PCR reaction mix: DNA template, primers, dNTPs,
MgCl2, buffer, and Taq polymerase.
• Set PCR conditions: initial denaturation at 95°C for 5 minutes
followed by 35 cycles of denaturation at 95°C for 30 seconds,
annealing at appropriate temperature for 30 seconds, extension at
72°C for 1 minute, and final extension at 72°C for 10 minutes.
C. Gel Electrophoresis:
• Analyze PCR products on a 1-2% agarose gel.
• Visualize and document the DNA bands under UV light.
D. Sequencing:
• Purify PCR products using spin columns or enzymatic cleanup.
• Perform cycle sequencing reactions as per the sequencing kit
protocol.
• Analyze the sequencing products on the sequencing platform.
E. Data Analysis:
• Use bioinformatics software to align sequencing reads to the
reference GLA gene sequence.
• Identify and annotate variants.
• Compare detected variants with known pathogenic mutations in
databases (e.g., ClinVar, HGMD).
F. Interpretation and Reporting:
• Interpret the clinical significance of identified variants.
• Generate a comprehensive report indicating whether any
pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants were identified.
• Include recommendations for genetic counseling where
appropriate.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
Internal Quality Control:
• Ensure proper functioning of the PCR thermocycler and
sequencing instrument by running control DNA samples.
• Validate new lots of reagents and primers.
External Quality Assessment:
• Participate in inter-laboratory comparisons and proficiency testing
programs.
6. SAFETY AND COMPLIANCE
Adhere to all laboratory safety guidelines, including the handling and
disposal of biohazardous materials. Ensure compliance with CLIA,
CAP, and other relevant regulatory and accreditation standards.
7. REFERENCES
• Refer to the manufacturer’s manuals for DNA extraction, PCR,
sequencing kits, and instruments.
• GLA gene information and mutation databases.
8. REVIEW AND APPROVAL
This SOP must be reviewed and approved by the lab director or
designated supervisor and reviewed annually or when any changes
are made to the procedure or equipment.
