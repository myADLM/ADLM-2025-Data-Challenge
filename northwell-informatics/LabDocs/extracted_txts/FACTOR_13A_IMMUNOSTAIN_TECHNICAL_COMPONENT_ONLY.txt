Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for FACTOR 13A
IMMUNOSTAIN, TECHNICAL COMPONENT ONLY
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to provide a standardized procedure for
the technical component of staining tissue samples for Factor 13A
using immunohistochemistry (IHC). This procedure ensures
consistent and accurate staining results for proper evaluation by the
pathologist.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory personnel, including technologists and
technicians, are responsible for performing the staining procedure
as outlined in this SOP.
• It is the responsibility of all staff involved to follow the procedure
accurately and report any inconsistencies or issues to the
supervisor promptly.
1. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all tissue samples received in the laboratory that
require Factor 13A immunostaining for diagnostic purposes.
1. DEFINITION
Factor 13A (FXIIIa) is a blood coagulation factor involved in
stabilizing fibrin clots. Immunostaining for Factor 13A is used to
detect its expression in tissue samples, which can aid in the
diagnosis of various medical conditions.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type:
• Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks are
required for this procedure.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Tissue blocks that are not properly fixed or embedded.
• Tissue samples that are insufficient in size or quality.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Microtome
• Water bath
• Slide warmer
• Staining racks
• Timer
• Light Microscope
Reagents and Supplies:
• Factor 13A primary antibody
• Secondary antibody (HRP-conjugated)
• Detection system (e.g., DAB substrate)
• Hematoxylin (counterstain)
• Bond™ Automated Immunostainer (or equivalent)
• Xylene
• Ethanol (100%, 95%, 70%)
• Mounting medium
• Cover slips
1. PROCEDURE
A. Sectioning and Slide Preparation:
1. Cut 4-5 μm sections from the FFPE tissue block using the
microtome.
2. Float the sections on a water bath set at 40-45°C.
3. Transfer the sections onto positively charged glass slides.
4. Dry the slides on a slide warmer at 60°C for 30-60 minutes.
B. Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
1. Deparaffinize the sections by placing the slides in xylene for 3
changes (5 minutes each).
2. Rehydrate the sections through a series of graded ethanol (2
changes of 100%, 95%, and 70%, 5 minutes each).
3. Rinse the slides in distilled water for 5 minutes.
C. Antigen Retrieval:
1. Perform antigen retrieval using a suitable retrieval solution and
method (e.g., heat-induced retrieval using citrate buffer, pH
6.0).
2. Cool the slides down to room temperature and rinse in distilled
water.
D. Blocking:
1. Apply a protein block to the sections to block non-specific
binding.
2. Incubate for 10-15 minutes at room temperature.
E. Primary Antibody Incubation:
1. Apply the Factor 13A primary antibody to the sections.
2. Incubate in a humidified chamber for 30-60 minutes at room
temperature.
3. Rinse the slides in buffer solution (e.g., PBS) for 3 changes (5
minutes each).
F. Secondary Antibody Incubation:
1. Apply the HRP-conjugated secondary antibody to the sections.
2. Incubate in a humidified chamber for 30 minutes at room
temperature.
3. Rinse the slides in buffer solution (e.g., PBS) for 3 changes (5
minutes each).
G. Detection:
1. Apply the DAB substrate to the sections.
2. Monitor the development under a microscope until desired
staining intensity is achieved.
3. Stop the reaction by rinsing the slides in distilled water.
H. Counterstaining:
1. Counterstain the sections with hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes.
2. Rinse the slides in distilled water and then in running tap water
until clear.
I. Dehydration and Clearing:
1. Dehydrate the sections through graded ethanol (70%, 95%,
100%; 5 minutes each).
2. Clear the sections in xylene for 2 changes (5 minutes each).
J. Mounting:
1. Apply mounting medium to the sections and cover with a cover
slip.
2. Allow the slides to dry completely.
3. QUALITY CONTROL
• Quality control (QC) slides with known positive and negative
controls must be processed alongside patient samples to ensure
the staining protocol is working properly.
• Document QC results and any discrepancies. If controls do not
stain appropriately, re-evaluate the staining procedure and
reagents.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Technologists must review the stained slides under a light
microscope to ensure staining quality.
• Stained slides are then forwarded to the pathologist for
interpretation and diagnostic reporting.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's instructions for all reagents and antibodies used.
• Relevant laboratory protocols and guidelines for
immunohistochemistry.
1. REVISION HISTORY
• Document any revisions to the procedure with dates and
descriptions of changes.
This SOP is effective as of [Date] and must be reviewed annually or
as necessary due to procedural changes. All staff are expected to
adhere to the guidelines detailed above for consistent and reliable
results.
