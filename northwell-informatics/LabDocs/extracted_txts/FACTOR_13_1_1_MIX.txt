FACTOR 13 1:1 MIX PROCEDURE
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to provide detailed instructions on
how to perform a Factor XIII (FXIII) 1:1 mix assay. This assay is used
to evaluate the factor XIII activity in patient plasma, which is essential
in determining potential bleeding disorders or clotting deficiencies.
Responsibility: All designated laboratory personnel who have
received the appropriate training are responsible for performing the
FXIII 1:1 mix assay according to this protocol. It is also the
responsibility of the laboratory staff and supervisors to ensure
adherence to the protocol, including any corrective actions required.
1. DEFINITION
The FXIII 1:1 mix assay involves mixing patient plasma with normal
pooled plasma in a 1:1 ratio to assess the effect on clot formation and
stability, which indicates FXIII activity.
1. SPECIMEN
Preferred/acceptable:
• Citrated plasma: Collect blood in a 3.2% sodium citrate (light blue-
top) tube and centrifuge to obtain citrated plasma. Perform testing
within 4 hours of collection if stored at room temperature or within
24 hours if stored at 2-8°C.
Unacceptable:
• Hemolyzed or lipemic samples.
• Samples collected in EDTA, heparin, or other anticoagulants.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Coagulometer
• Normal pooled plasma (NPP)
• FXIII-deficient plasma
• Timer
• Micropipettes and tips
• Plastic tubes or cuvettes
• 37°C water bath or incubator
• Documentation forms and log books
1. PROCEDURE
2. Preparation:
◦ Thaw and equilibrate normal pooled plasma (NPP) and
FXIII-deficient plasma to 37°C when ready to use.
◦ Calibrate the coagulometer according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
◦ Document the specimen information on the log forms.
3. Pre-mixing:
◦ Label tubes or cuvettes for the patient plasma, normal
pooled plasma (NPP), and the 1:1 mix samples.
◦ Prepare the following solutions: a. 100 µL of patient plasma
alone b. 100 µL of normal pooled plasma alone c. 100 µL of
1:1 mix (50 µL of patient plasma + 50 µL NPP)
4. Assay Procedure:
◦ Ensure that all reagents and samples are at 37°C before
starting the assay.
◦ Add the 100 µL of patient plasma, NPP, and 1:1 mix
individually into the pre-labeled cuvettes/tubes.
◦ Add an equal volume of FXIII-deficient plasma to each
sample.
◦ Follow manufacturer's instructions to initiate clotting reaction
in the coagulometer.
◦ Measure the clot formation and document the clotting times
for each sample.
5. Interpretation:
◦ Compare the clotting times of the patient plasma, NPP, and
the 1:1 mix.
◦ An improvement in the clotting time of the 1:1 mix compared
to the patient plasma alone suggests a factor deficiency or
inhibitor is present.
◦ If the clotting time does not correct with the 1:1 mix, this
may indicate a strong inhibitor or factor-specific issue.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include quality control samples with known FXIII activity levels in
each run to ensure assay accuracy and precision.
• Document temperature checks for the 37°C water bath or
incubator.
• Perform equipment calibration and maintenance as instructed by
the manufacturer.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results are automatically transmitted to the Laboratory
Information System (LIS) or manually entered by the technologist.
• Review and verify all results according to standard laboratory
procedures.
• Critical values must be communicated to the attending physician
immediately and documented in the LIS.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Ensure proper sample handling to avoid erroneous results due to
pre-analytical variables such as hemolysis or inadequate
anticoagulation.
• Refer to manufacturer's documentation for specific limitations
concerning the coagulometer and reagent performance.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions for coagulometer use and
maintenance.
• Relevant clinical guidelines for FXIII activity testing.
• Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines for
coagulation testing.
1. DOCUMENTATION
• Record all pertinent information, including sample ID, clotting
times, quality control results, and any corrective actions taken in
the appropriate logbooks or electronic records.
Note: Adherence to current Good Laboratory Practices (GLP) is
mandatory while performing this protocol to ensure reliable and
accurate results.
This protocol will be regularly reviewed and updated to incorporate
new advancements or changes in relevant guidelines, with the next
review scheduled for October 2024.
