SOP for the Analytical Phase of Generating Results for FACTOR 13,
QUALITATIVE, WITH REFLEX TO FACTOR 13 1:1 MIX
1. PURPOSE
This protocol outlines the procedure for the qualitative analysis of
Factor 13 (FXIII) and the reflex testing to Factor 13 1:1 Mix when
appropriate. The analysis is performed to detect FXIII deficiency,
which may lead to bleeding disorders.
Responsibility: Designated clinical laboratory scientists (CLS) are
responsible for the execution of the FXIII qualitative test and reflexing
to FXIII 1:1 Mix as needed. Supervisors must ensure adherence to
the SOP and address any deficiencies that may affect test outcomes.
1. DEFINITION
FXIII qualitative testing assesses the presence and functionality of
Factor 13 in the blood plasma. Reflex to FXIII 1:1 Mix is performed if
the initial qualitative test indicates potential deficiency.
1. PROCEDURE
Sample Requirements: Preferred/acceptable:
• Citrated plasma (0.109 M or 3.2%) collected in blue-top tubes.
• Specimen should be processed within 4 hours of collection or
frozen at -20°C if processing is delayed.
Unacceptable:
• Hemolysed samples.
• Samples collected in tubes other than 0.109 M citrate or with
anticoagulants other than citrate.
• Samples received more than 24 hours after collection if not
frozen.
Equipment, Reagents and Supplies:
• Factor 13 (FXIII) Qualitative Assay Kit.
• FXIII 1:1 Mix reagents.
• Citrated plasma.
• Calibrated pipettes and volumetric mixers.
• Plate reader or coagulation analyzer.
• Control samples (negative and positive controls for quality
assurance).
Procedure:
Step-by-Step Workflow for FXIII Qualitative Assay:
1. Prepare the workspace and ensure all needed equipment and
reagents are available.
2. Thaw frozen citrated plasma samples at room temperature.
3. Prepare reagent mix as per the manufacturer's instructions
included with the FXIII kit.
4. Perform the FXIII qualitative testing:
◦ Pipette the specified volume of plasma into the reaction
vessel, according to the kit instructions.
◦ Mix components gently and incubate as directed.
◦ Read the results using a plate reader or coagulation
analyzer.
5. Interpretation of results:
◦ Positive Control: Must exhibit expected results to validate
the assay.
◦ Negative Control: Must exhibit expected negative results to
validate the assay.
◦ Patient Sample: Compare the sample results with control
results.
6. Document results in the laboratory information system (LIS).
Reflex Testing to FXIII 1:1 Mix:
If FXIII qualitative test indicates abnormal results:
1. Proceed with FXIII 1:1 Mix testing:
◦ Mix patient plasma with normal pool plasma in a 1:1 ratio.
◦ Prepare as per FXIII 1:1 Mix reagent instructions.
2. Repeat the coagulation assay steps as for the qualitative
testing.
3. Document the reflex results in the LIS with detailed
observations.
Quality Control:
• Run quality control samples (positive and negative) with each
batch of tests.
• Acceptable variations are within specified control range outlined in
the kit insert.
• Document QC results in the appropriate logbook.
Reporting Results: Refer to site-specific reporting guidelines and
laboratory software protocols for result entry.
Reference Intervals:
• Positive FXIII activity: No FXIII deficiency.
• Negative FXIII activity: Potential FXIII deficiency; reflex to FXIII
1:1 Mix testing required.
Method Limitations: Refer to the FXIII kit insert for specific reagent
limitations and troubleshooting steps.
