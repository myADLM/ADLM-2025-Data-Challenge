Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) FACTOR 8 RELATED
ANTIGEN IMMUNOSTAIN, TECHNICAL COMPONENT ONLY
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is to
outline the accurate and uniform steps required to perform the
analytical phase of generating results for Factor 8 Related Antigen
Immunostain. The aim is to ensure reliable and consistent staining
results, which are critical for diagnostic purposes.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory staff (histotechnologists) trained in
immunohistochemistry (IHC) are responsible for performing and
documenting all steps described in this procedure.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring that the staff comply with
this SOP and for providing any necessary troubleshooting
assistance.
1. DEFINITION
Factor 8 Related Antigen (von Willebrand Factor) is a glycoprotein
involved in hemostasis. The immunostain for Factor 8 Related
Antigen is commonly utilized to identify blood vessels in tissues and
various pathologies related to vascular structures.
1. PROCEDURE
Specimen Preparation:
• Ensure tissue specimens have been processed and embedded in
paraffin blocks per standard histology procedures.
• Cut 4-5 µm thick sections from the paraffin block using a
microtome and mount sections on positively charged microscope
slides.
• Dry the slides overnight at 37°C or for 1 hour at 60°C.
Reagents and Supplies:
• Primary antibody specific to the Factor 8 Related Antigen
• Secondary antibody reagent
• Detection system (appropriate chromogen)
• Blocking solution
• Antigen retrieval solution (buffer)
• Wash buffers (such as TBS or PBS)
• Mounting medium and coverslips
• Hematoxylin for counterstaining
Equipment:
• Microtome
• Slide warmer or oven
• Water bath or pressure cooker for antigen retrieval
• Humidity chamber
• Microscope
Procedure: A) Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
1. Bake slides at 60°C for 1 hour.
2. Deparaffinize slides in xylene or equivalent reagent (2 changes,
5 minutes each).
3. Rehydrate through a graded series of alcohols:
◦ 100% ethanol (2 changes, 3 minutes each)
◦ 95% ethanol (1 change, 3 minutes)
◦ 70% ethanol (1 change, 3 minutes)
4. Immerse slides in distilled water for at least 5 minutes.
B) Antigen Retrieval:
1. Place slides in a preheated antigen retrieval solution (buffer)
and heat using a water bath or pressure cooker as per the
manufacturer's instructions.
2. Allow slides to cool for 20 minutes at room temperature.
3. Rinse slides in distilled water followed by wash buffer.
C) Blocking:
1. Incubate slides in blocking solution for 10 minutes to prevent
non-specific binding.
2. Drain slides but do not rinse.
D) Primary Antibody Incubation:
1. Apply primary antibody (Factor 8 Related Antigen) to each
slide.
2. Incubate in a humidity chamber at optimal conditions (typically
30-60 minutes at room temperature or per manufacturer's
instructions).
3. Wash slides in wash buffer (3 changes, 5 minutes each).
E) Secondary Antibody and Detection:
1. Apply secondary antibody and incubate as per manufacturer's
instructions.
2. Wash slides in wash buffer (3 changes, 5 minutes each).
3. Apply chromogen substrate and incubate until desired stain
intensity is achieved (usually 5-10 minutes).
4. Rinse slides in distilled water to stop the reaction.
F) Counterstaining:
1. Immerse slides in hematoxylin for counterstaining (1-2
minutes).
2. Rinse slides in distilled water.
3. Differentiate in acid alcohol (if necessary) and “blue” in alkaline
solution or tap water.
4. Dehydrate through graded alcohols:
◦ 70% ethanol (1 change, 1 minute)
◦ 95% ethanol (1 change, 1 minute)
◦ 100% ethanol (2 changes, 1 minute each)
5. Clear in xylene (2 changes, 5 minutes each).
G) Mounting:
1. Apply mounting medium and coverslip.
2. QUALITY CONTROL
3. Include positive and negative control tissues with each staining
run to ensure stain specificity and sensitivity.
4. Document reagent lot numbers and expiration dates.
5. Monitor and record instrument temperatures and times used
during antigen retrieval.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
• Slides are delivered to the pathologist for evaluation.
• Pathologist reviews the stained slides and generates the
diagnostic interpretation.
• Technologist documents completion of staining in the laboratory
information system (LIS).
1. TROUBLESHOOTING
If staining results are unsatisfactory (e.g., non-specific staining, weak
staining, or no staining):
• Check and ensure that all reagents are within their expiration date
and stored correctly.
• Verify that the antigen retrieval was performed correctly (time,
temperature, and buffer).
• Ensure proper incubation times and temperatures were
maintained.
• Review the preparation of the primary antibody and its
application.
• Repeat the staining process if necessary and document corrective
actions taken.
