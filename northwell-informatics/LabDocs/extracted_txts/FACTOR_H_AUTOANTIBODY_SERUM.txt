1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this protocol is to outline the analytical phase
procedure for generating results for the Factor H Autoantibody,
Serum test. This protocol ensures that testing is performed in a
consistent, accurate, and reliable manner following CLIA guidelines.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the Factor
H Autoantibody, Serum test according to the procedures outlined in
this document. The staff must ensure that all testing is carried out
under appropriate conditions and documented accurately.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Microtiter Plate Reader (capable of reading at 450 nm)
• Incubator (37°C)
• Plate Washer or Manual Washing Station
• Pipettes (single and multi-channel)
• Vortex Mixer
• Timer
• Factor H Autoantibody Test Kit (including all necessary reagents
and controls)
• Calibrators and Controls
• Plate Sealers
• 1N NaOH
1. PROCEDURE
a) Preparation:
1. Prepare Reagents: Reconstitute all kit reagents, controls, and
calibrators as per the manufacturer's instructions. Allow
reagents to come to room temperature if previously
refrigerated.
2. Calibrator and Control Preparation: Calibrators and controls
should be prepared and diluted as per the manufacturer's
recommendations, ensuring they cover the range of expected
test values.
3. Sample Preparation: Ensure serum specimens have been
properly accessioned and stored. Thaw if previously frozen and
mix well before use.
b) Plate Setup:
1. Plate Layout: Allocate wells for calibrators, controls, and
patient specimens according to the plate map. Each run must
include a full set of calibrators and appropriate controls.
2. Addition of Samples: Pipette appropriate amounts (as
specified by the kit instructions) of calibrators, controls, and
specimens into designated wells.
c) Incubation:
1. Incubate Plate: Seal the plate with a plate sealer and incubate
at 37°C for the time specified in the kit protocol.
2. Wash Steps: Following incubation, perform washing steps as
indicated. Ensure wells are thoroughly washed to avoid cross-
contamination.
d) Detection:
1. Add Detection Reagents: Add the specified volume of
detection conjugate to each well. Incubate the plate at 37°C for
the required time.
2. Final Wash: Wash the plate thoroughly as per instructions.
3. Substrate Addition: Add the substrate solution to each well
and incubate in the dark at room temperature for the prescribed
time.
4. Stop Reaction: Add stop solution (e.g., 1N NaOH) to each well
to halt the enzymatic reaction.
e) Reading and Interpretation:
1. Read Plate: Measure absorbance at 450 nm using a microtiter
plate reader. Ensure that readings are taken within the
timeframe specified by the test kit.
2. Calculate Results: Generate the standard curve using the
absorbance values of the calibrators and calculate the
concentration of Factor H Autoantibodies in patient specimens.
f) Quality Control:
1. QC Evaluation: Verify that the control values fall within the
established acceptable range. Confirm that the assay
performance is within specifications.
2. Out of Range Controls: If controls are out-of-range,
investigate potential causes, confirm reagent integrity, and
consider repeating the assay.
3. REPORTING RESULTS
• Enter the calculated results into the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
• Review and verify the results for accuracy before reporting.
• Document any deviations from the standard protocol and take
appropriate corrective actions.
1. REFERENCE RANGES
Reference ranges for Factor H Autoantibody levels should be
sourced from the manufacturer's guidelines or established in-house
based on clinical validation studies.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the test kit insert for specific limitations associated with the
assay. Be aware of potential interferences or conditions that may
affect test accuracy.
1. REFERENCES
Include the manufacturer's product insert and any relevant published
literature on Factor H Autoantibody testing.
By following this protocol, laboratory personnel will ensure the
accurate and reproducible measurement of Factor H Autoantibodies
in serum specimens. This contributes to the effective diagnosis and
management of conditions associated with autoimmune activity
against Factor H.
