Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: FACTOR II INHIBITOR EVALUATION, PLASMA
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this procedure is to provide a
standardized method for the detection and quantification of
Factor II inhibitors in plasma samples. This SOP ensures
consistency and accuracy in the analytical phase of generating
test results for Factor II inhibitor evaluation.
Responsibility: All trained laboratory personnel are responsible for
adhering to this procedure. It is the supervisors’ responsibility to
ensure compliance with the SOP and address any discrepancies or
issues during testing.
1. SCOPE This procedure applies to all plasma samples received
for Factor II inhibitor evaluation. The steps outlined herein cover
the entire analytical phase from sample preparation to result
generation and reporting.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND HANDLING
Specimen Type: Plasma collected in sodium citrate (light blue-top)
tubes.
Specimen Collection:
• Draw blood into a sodium citrate tube, ensuring the correct blood-
to-anticoagulant ratio.
• Invert gently to mix.
• Transport the specimen to the laboratory promptly and maintain at
1-10°C during transport if necessary.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Clotted or grossly hemolyzed specimens
• Samples not properly labeled
• Samples received in containers other than sodium citrate tubes
• Samples that are not properly mixed
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND MATERIALS
Equipment:
• Centrifuge
• Calibrated pipettes and tips
• Coagulation analyzer (as per lab specifications)
• Timer
Reagents:
• Factor II-deficient plasma
• Normal pooled plasma
• Calcium chloride solution (0.025M)
• Phospholipid reagent
• Factor II substrate
• Appropriate controls (negative and positive controls)
Materials:
• Test tubes
• Pipettes and tips
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
1. PROCEDURE 5.1 Sample Preparation:
2. Centrifuge the specimen at 1500 x g for 15 minutes to obtain
platelet-poor plasma.
3. Carefully transfer the plasma into a clean, labeled test tube.
4. Store the plasma at -20°C if not tested immediately.
5.2 Preparation of Reagents:
1. Thaw and reconstitute all reagents as per manufacturer's
instructions.
2. Prepare a fresh mixture of calcium chloride and phospholipid
reagent immediately before use.
5.3 Assay Procedure:
1. Add 100 µL of sample plasma to one test tube.
2. Add 100 µL of Factor II-deficient plasma to the sample tube.
3. Incubate the mixture at 37°C for 2 minutes.
4. Add 100 µL of the reagent mixture (calcium chloride and
phospholipid) to the tube.
5. Start the timer immediately and record the clotting time.
6. Repeat steps 1-5 for normal pooled plasma (control) and
appropriate controls.
7. Perform the assay in duplicate for reliable results.
8. Calculate the average clotting time for accuracy.
9. CALCULATIONS AND INTERPRETATIONS
10. Calculate the Factor II activity level by comparing the clotting
time of the test sample to that of the normal pooled plasma
control.
11. Use the appropriate calculation formula provided by the reagent
manufacturer to determine the level of Factor II inhibitor.
12. Compare the results to reference ranges to interpret the
presence and degree of Factor II inhibition.
Reference Ranges:
• Normal range (no inhibitors): 70-130% (or as per manufacturer
guidelines)
• Presence of inhibitors: <50% indicates a strong inhibitor presence
1. QUALITY CONTROL
2. Run internal quality controls with every batch of tests to ensure
accuracy and reliability.
3. Document the control results and any corrective actions taken
for out-of-range results.
4. REPORTING RESULTS
5. Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
6. Verify and validate results, ensuring all values fall within
acceptable ranges.
7. If critical or abnormal results are identified, promptly notify the
responsible clinician according to the laboratory’s policy.
