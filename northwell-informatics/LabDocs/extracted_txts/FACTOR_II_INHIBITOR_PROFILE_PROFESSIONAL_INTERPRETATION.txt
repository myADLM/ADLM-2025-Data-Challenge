1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to establish consistent and
reliable methodologies for performing and interpreting the
Factor II Inhibitor Profile test. This includes creating a
framework for the professional interpretation of test results to
ensure accurate and timely reporting.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all medical laboratory scientists and
relevant personnel conducting the analytical phase of the
Factor II Inhibitor Profile test.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
All designated laboratory personnel are responsible for
adhering to this protocol and ensuring accurate and timely
testing. It is the responsibility of trained and authorized
laboratory scientists to ensure proper execution of this
procedure and accurate interpretation of the results, with input
from a clinical pathologist or hematologist as necessary.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
a. Preferred Specimen: Citrated plasma collected in a light-blue
top tube. b. Volume: Minimum 2 mL plasma. c. Stability:
Specimen should be kept frozen at -70°C or lower until testing.
Specimen stability at -70°C is up to 4 months.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
a. Automated coagulation analyzer (e.g., Sysmex CA-1500,
ACL TOP 700). b. Factor II deficient plasma (commercially
available). c. Control plasma (normal and abnormal controls). d.
Factor II inhibitor reagents. e. Reagent quality control materials.
f. Calibrated pipettes and tips. g. Platelet-poor plasma controls
h. Manufacturer-provided reagents and test kits (follow
instructions provided in the package inserts).
6. PROCEDURE
6.1 Preparation of Reagents a. Reconstitute and prepare all
reagents according to the manufacturer's instructions. b. Allow
all reagents and controls to reach room temperature before
use.
6.2 Pre-Analytical Phase a. Ensure specimen integrity by
verifying proper collection, labeling, and handling. b. Centrifuge
the citrated plasma tubes at 2000 g for 15 minutes at room
temperature to obtain platelet-poor plasma. c. Aliquot the
plasma and freeze at -70°C if not immediately testing.
6.3 Analytical Phase a. Calibration and QC i. Perform
calibration on the coagulation analyzer as per manufacturer’s
protocol. ii. Run normal and abnormal control plasmas to verify
analyzer performance. iii. Document calibration and QC results
for traceability.
b. Test Procedure
i. Thaw the patient sample aliquot in a 37°C water bath for 5 minutes.
ii. Gently mix by inverting the tubes and avoiding frothing.
iii. Add 200 µL of the patient plasma to a cuvette in the analyzer.
iv. Add 100 µL of Factor II deficient plasma to the cuvette.
v. Initiate the assay on the coagulation analyzer.
vi. Record the time to clot formation which is indicative of Factor II activity.
c. Inhibitor Titration
i. To determine the presence of inhibitors, perform a mixing study.
ii. Mix 1 part patient plasma with 4 parts normal pooled plasma to measure the immediate Factor II activity and the residual activity after 2-hour incubation at 37°C.
iii. A significant drop in activity suggests the presence of an inhibitor.
7. INTERPRETATION AND REPORTING
a. Review the test results and QC data to ensure they fall within
target ranges. b. Interpret the Factor II inhibitor profile results,
taking into account any discrepancies and clinical history. c.
Document any abnormal findings or potential inhibitors. d.
Generate a professional interpretation report, which includes: i.
Patient information. ii. Factor II activity levels. iii. Presence or
absence of inhibitors. iv. Appropriate reference ranges. v.
Clinical significance and recommendations for further testing.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
a. Utilize quality control materials with every batch of
specimens tested. b. Maintain a log of control results,
calibrations, and any corrective actions taken. c. Perform
proficiency testing and internal audits to ensure compliance
with laboratory standards. d. Maintain records of maintenance
and service of analytical instruments.
9. SAFETY AND COMPLIANCE
a. Follow standard laboratory safety protocols, including
wearing appropriate PPE and using biosafety cabinets when
handling specimens. b. Dispose of biological and hazardous
waste according to established guidelines.
