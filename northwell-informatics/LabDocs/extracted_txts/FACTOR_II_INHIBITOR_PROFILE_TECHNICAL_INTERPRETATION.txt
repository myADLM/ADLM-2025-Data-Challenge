Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for FACTOR II INHIBITOR
PROFILE, TECHNICAL INTERPRETATION
1. PURPOSE
To provide a consistent and accurate method for the detection and
interpretation of Factor II inhibitor profiles in patient samples. This
SOP ensures the accurate and reproducible determination of Factor
II activity and the presence of inhibitors.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the
Factor II Inhibitor Profile tests according to this protocol.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring that staff are trained and
proficient in these procedures.
1. DEFINITIONS
Factor II Inhibitor: An antibody that specifically targets and neutralizes
Factor II (prothrombin) activity, potentially causing bleeding disorders.
1. PROCEDURE
A) Equipment and Reagents:
• Platelet-poor plasma (PPP) samples
• Calibrated pipettes and tips
• Incubator set at 37°C
• Microplate reader or coagulation analyzer
• Reference plasma with known Factor II activity
• Factor II deficient plasma
• FV and FVIII depleted plasma
• Control plasmas (normal and abnormal)
• Buffered saline solution (0.15M NaCl, pH 7.35 - 7.45)
• 50:50 mix of patient and reference plasma
B) Specimen:
• Preferred specimen: 3.2% sodium citrate anticoagulated plasma,
processed to platelet-poor plasma within 4 hours of collection.
• Storage: Store samples at -20°C if not tested within 4 hours.
Thaw samples at 37°C before testing.
C) Determination of Factor II Activity:
1. Thaw and prepare all reagents and plasma samples prior to
testing.
2. Pipette required volumes of patient PPP and reference plasma
into separate test tubes.
3. Incubate at 37°C for 5 minutes.
4. Mix 50µL of patient PPP with 50µL of reference plasma in a
clean test tube, mix gently.
5. Simultaneously prepare a mixture of 50µL normal plasma and
50µL reference plasma as a control.
6. Add 100µL of Factor II deficient plasma to each test tube.
7. Incubate all mixtures at 37°C for 5 minutes.
8. Measure clotting time using the microplate reader or
coagulation analyzer following the manufacturer's instructions.
9. Generate a standard curve using known Factor II activities.
D) Calculation of Factor II Inhibitor:
1. Calculate the Factor II activity in the patient’s plasma from the
standard curve.
2. Incubate patient PPP mixed 1:1 with normal reference plasma
at 37°C for 2 hours.
3. Repeat the Factor II activity test on the mixture.
4. Compare the post-incubation activity to the pre-incubation
activity to determine the presence of an inhibitor. A significant
decrease suggests the presence of an inhibitor.
E) Interpretation:
1. Results are expressed as a percentage of normal Factor II
activity.
2. Reference ranges (for normal activity): 70-130% of normal.
3. If patient activity is <50% after incubation and there is a
significant decrease compared to pre-incubation, a Factor II
inhibitor is indicated.
F) Quality Control:
1. Run control plasmas alongside patient samples to ensure the
reliability of test results.
2. Document all control results and ensure they fall within
established acceptable ranges.
3. Perform proficiency testing and interlaboratory comparisons
periodically.
G) Reporting Results:
1. Enter results into the laboratory information system (LIS) and
verify.
2. Document any critical values and notify the appropriate
healthcare provider immediately.
3. Results should include:
◦ Factor II activity percentage
◦ Observation of inhibition if present
◦ Any critical flags or alerts
H) Documentation:
1. Record all patient and control data in the laboratory's records.
2. Maintain records of QC results and any corrective actions
taken.
3. Ensure that all equipment calibrations and maintenance logs
are up-to-date.
I) Troubleshooting:
1. If QC fails, investigate potential issues (e.g., reagent expiry,
equipment malfunction) and repeat the test.
2. If patient samples show unexpected results, consider pre-
analytical variables (e.g., sample handling, patient medication
history).
