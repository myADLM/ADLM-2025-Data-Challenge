Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) FACTOR II INHIBITOR
SCREEN, PLASMA
1. PURPOSE
To provide accurate and reliable screening for Factor II (Prothrombin)
inhibitors in plasma samples. This SOP outlines procedures for the
analytical phase, involving processing and analyzing plasma samples
for Factor II inhibitors.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory technologists are responsible for
performing the analysis according to this procedure.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring compliance with this
SOP and for validating and verifying results.
1. DEFINITION
Factor II Inhibitor Screen assesses the presence of inhibitors that can
affect the function of Factor II in the blood clotting process.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type:
• Platelet-poor plasma
Collection:
• Collect blood samples in sodium citrate tubes (light blue top).
• Ensure proper mixing by gentle inversion.
• Centrifuge the sample at 1500 x g for 15 minutes to obtain
platelet-poor plasma.
• Aliquot plasma into labeled polypropylene tubes immediately after
centrifugation within 1 hour of collection.
• Store plasma at -20°C or colder if not analyzed immediately;
avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
• Samples collected in any anticoagulant other than sodium citrate.
• Clotted samples.
• Samples submitted beyond the stability timelines (either unfrozen
or after improper storage conditions).
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Centrifuge
• Microplate reader or coagulation analyzer suitable for clotting
assays
• Pipettes and tips
• Timer
Reagents:
• Factor II deficient plasma
• Thromboplastin reagent
• Normal control plasma
• Abnormal control plasma
• Calcium chloride solution (0.025 M)
Supplies:
• Polypropylene sample tubes
• Microplates
• Disposable pipettes
• Parafilm or microplate sealers
• Quality control materials
1. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
• Thaw frozen plasma samples and controls at 37°C in a water
bath, ensuring complete thawing before analysis.
• Prepare all reagents and controls as per the manufacturer’s
instructions.
Procedure Steps:
1. Sample and Control Preparation:
◦ Perform all assays in duplicates.
◦ Set up duplicate wells for normal control, abnormal control,
and patient samples on the microplate.
2. Assay Setup:
◦ Add 50 µL of normal control plasma to the appropriate wells.
◦ Add 50 µL of abnormal control plasma to the appropriate
wells.
◦ Add 50 µL of patient plasma sample to the appropriate
wells.
◦ Add 50 µL of Factor II deficient plasma to each well.
◦ Mix gently and incubate at 37°C for 2-5 minutes.
3. Activation:
◦ Add 100 µL of pre-warmed thromboplastin reagent to each
well.
◦ Simultaneously start the timer.
◦ Incubate at 37°C for a specified period (usually 120–180
seconds).
4. Reaction Termination and Reading:
◦ Add 50 µL of 0.025 M calcium chloride solution to each well
at the end of incubation.
◦ Measure the optical density at 405 nm using a microplate
reader or follow the manufacturer's recommendations for a
coagulation analyzer.
◦ Record the clotting times.
Calculation:
• Calculate the clotting time ratio for each sample: [ \text{Clotting
Time Ratio} = \frac{\text{Clotting Time of Patient Sample}}
{\text{Clotting Time of Normal Control}} ]
Interpretation:
• Compare results against reference intervals:
◦ Normal ratio: Indicate absence of inhibitors.
◦ Prolonged clotting time ratio: Indicate presence of inhibitors.
◦ Refer to the specific assay kit insert for interpretive criteria.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform QC using normal and abnormal control plasmas each
day of testing.
• QC results must fall within established ranges before patient
results are reported.
• Document any corrective actions performed when QC results fall
outside acceptable ranges.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Verify results before releasing them to ensure accuracy and
compliance with established criteria.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Normal Ratio: 0.8 - 1.2
• Prolonged Ratio: >1.2 (Refer to specific kit insert for detailed
criteria)
1. LIMITATIONS
• Improper sample handling or storage can lead to erroneous
results.
• Hemolysis, lipemia, and icterus can interfere with the assay.
• Patients on anticoagulant therapy may yield prolonged clotting
times unrelated to inhibitors.
