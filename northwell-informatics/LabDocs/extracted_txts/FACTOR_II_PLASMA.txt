Standard Operating Procedure Title: Analytical Phase for Generating
Results of Factor II, Plasma Date: [Insert Date]
1. PURPOSE
To detail the procedure for the analysis and generation of test results
for Factor II (Prothrombin) levels in plasma samples in a CLIA-
certified laboratory.
Responsibility:
Designated staff members including medical laboratory technologists
and laboratory supervisors are responsible for performing the
procedure according to established protocols and ensuring the
accuracy and reliability of results.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen Type:
• Preferred: Plasma collected in Sodium Citrate (light blue top tube)
• Unacceptable: Specimens collected in tubes containing
anticoagulants other than Sodium Citrate (e.g., EDTA, Heparin)
Specimen Handling:
• Specimens should be centrifuged promptly at 1500-2000g for 15
minutes to separate plasma.
• Store plasma at 2-8°C if analysis will occur within 48 hours. If
storing longer, freeze at -20°C or below.
• Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Coagulation analyzer (e.g., Sysmex CA-1500)
• Precision pipettes
Reagents:
• Factor II deficiency plasma
• Calcium chloride solution, 0.025M
• Factor II assay reagent kit (compliant with regulatory standards)
Supplies:
• Sodium Citrate evacuated collection tubes
• Disposable pipettes
• Sample cups
• Quality control materials
1. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
• Ensure the coagulation analyzer is calibrated and performs within
acceptable ranges.
• Validate that all reagents and supplies are within expiration dates.
Factor II Assay Processing:
1. Allow plasma samples to come to room temperature if
previously refrigerated or thawed.
2. Prepare reagent mixture according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
3. Pipette exact volumes of plasma and reagent mixture into the
sample cups.
4. Load sample cups into the coagulation analyzer.
5. Initiate the analyzer with the Factor II assay settings.
Quality Control:
• Run both Negative and Positive controls before patient samples
to ensure assay integrity.
• Record control results in the Quality Control log and verify they
are within acceptable limits.
Troubleshooting:
• If control results fall outside acceptable ranges, follow analyzer
manufacturer troubleshooting guide.
• Document any corrective actions taken.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
Results Processing:
• Coagulation analyzer generates Factor II levels based on clotting
time.
• Verify and review the results obtained from the analyzer.
• Document any discrepancies or unusual findings.
Critical Results:
• Factor II levels significantly below normal reference range should
be actioned as critical and documented following the Repeat
Critical Values guidelines.
Reporting:
• Results are transmitted automatically to the Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
• Technologist reviews and verifies results before final reporting.
◦ Any flagged results due to analyzer messages or codes
should be investigated and a final decision made, ensuring
proper documentation in laboratory records.
1. QUALITY CONTROL AND VALIDATION
Internal Quality Control:
• Perform monthly consistency checks.
• Document comparison studies with inter-laboratory standards.
External Calibration:
• Twice a year, engage with external organizations for cross-
validation of results.
