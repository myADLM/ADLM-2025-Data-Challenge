Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Factor IX Inhibitor
Evaluation, Plasma
1. PURPOSE
To provide a clear and concise procedure for the detection and
quantification of Factor IX inhibitors in plasma samples using the
Bethesda assay method. This evaluation is crucial for the
management of Hemophilia B patients, specifically those who
develop inhibitors against replacement Factor IX therapy.
Responsibility:
• It is the responsibility of trained laboratory personnel to perform
the assay and interpret the results.
• It is the responsibility of the designated supervisor to review the
results and ensure all procedures are followed accurately.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen:
• Preferred/acceptable: Citrated plasma collected in 3.2% sodium
citrate anticoagulant. The blood should be mixed gently by
inversion and centrifuged within one hour of collection to obtain
platelet-poor plasma (PPP). Plasma should be quick-frozen at
-70°C if not tested immediately.
• Unacceptable: Hemolyzed, icteric, or lipemic samples. Samples
with visible fibrin strands or clotted samples.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
Equipment:
• Coagulometer or automated coagulation analyzer capable of
performing clot-based assays.
• Centrifuge for plasma preparation.
• Pipettes and pipette tips.
• Water bath set at 37°C.
• Timer.
Reagents:
• Human Factor IX deficient plasma, commercially available.
• Normal pooled plasma (NPP) from at least 20 healthy donors.
• Buffered saline (pH 7.4).
• Imidazole buffer (0.025M, pH 7.4).
• Control positive inhibitor plasma samples.
Reagents Storage:
• Store reagents at 2-8°C or as per manufacturer's instructions.
• Prepare working aliquots and store at -70°C for up to 6 months.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation:
• Thaw frozen plasma samples rapidly at 37°C in a water bath. Do
not leave samples in the thawed state for more than 1 hour prior
to use.
B. Control Preparation:
• Prepare normal pooled plasma (NPP) – Pool an equal volume of
plasma from at least 20 normal donors. Aliquot and freeze.
C. Assay Procedure:
1. Label all tubes accordingly.
2. Prepare serial dilutions of the patient plasma in imidazole buffer
(1:2, 1:4, 1:8, etc.).
3. Mix 1 part of each diluted patient plasma with 1 part NPP.
4. Prepare a control mix with normal pooled plasma and buffered
saline (1:1 ratio).
5. Incubate mixed samples and controls at 37°C for 2 hours.
6. After incubation, cool immediately to stop the reaction and
promptly test for residual Factor IX activity using a clotting
assay.
◦ Add 100 µL of Factor IX deficient plasma to 100 µL of the
incubated mixture.
◦ Start the coagulometer and record the clotting time.
D. Calculation:
• Use the Bethesda formula to determine the inhibitor titer: ( %\
\text{Residual Factor IX activity} = \left( \frac{\text{Clotting time of
control mix}}{\text{Clotting time of test mix}} \right) \times 100 )
• Multiply the residual activity by a logarithmic transformation to
calculate the Bethesda units (BU).
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform all procedures including the use of control positive and
control negative samples alongside patient samples.
• Regularly assess the precision and accuracy of the coagulation
analyzer.
• Verify the performance of each new batch of reagents before use.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results are calculated as Bethesda Units (BU) per mL.
• Inhibitor levels:
◦ Less than 0.6 BU/mL: Negative
◦ 0.6 - 1.0 BU/mL: Low responding inhibitor
◦ Greater than 1.0 BU/mL: High responding inhibitor
• Document all results promptly in the Laboratory Information
System (LIS) and ensure they are reviewed and verified by a
senior technologist or supervisor.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS:
• The absence of an inhibitor is indicated by a value of less than 0.6
BU/mL.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
• Results may be affected by the presence of anticoagulants or
other substances in the patient sample that interfere with clotting
assays.
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples are not suitable for testing
due to interference.
