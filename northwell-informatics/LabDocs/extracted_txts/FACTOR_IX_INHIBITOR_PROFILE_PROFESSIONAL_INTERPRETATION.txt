Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for FACTOR IX INHIBITOR
PROFILE, PROFESSIONAL INTERPRETATION
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedures and
responsibilities involved in the analytical phase of generating results
for Factor IX Inhibitor Profile and providing professional
interpretation.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the trained laboratory staff to perform the
analytical procedures accurately, document results appropriately, and
ensure timely communication with the attending professional
interpreter.
3. DEFINITION
Factor IX Inhibitor Profile refers to the evaluation of inhibitors against
the coagulation factor IX, typically performed for patients suspected
of having acquired Hemophilia B or other conditions involving factor
IX inhibition.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type:
• Citrated plasma
Collection and Storage:
• Collect blood in citrate tubes (blue top).
• Centrifuge to collect plasma within 1 hour of collection.
• Store plasma at -20°C or colder if analysis is not performed
immediately.
5. PROCEDURE
A) SETUP:
Equipment:
• Plate reader/Coagulation analyzer
• Factor IX-deficient plasma
• Normal human plasma
• APTT reagent
• Calcium chloride solution
• Thrombin reagent
• Control materials
Reagents:
• Factor IX standard
• Inhibitor assay kits
B) DETAILED ANALYSIS PROCEDURE:
1. Calibration and Setup:
• Ensure all equipment is calibrated according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
• Prepare reagents and control materials as per protocol.
2. Plasma Sample Preparation:
• Thaw frozen plasma samples at 37°C, avoiding repeated freeze-
thaw cycles.
• Perform necessary dilution as indicated in the inhibitor assay kit
instructions.
3. Factor IX Inhibitor Assay:
• Mix patient sample with Factor IX-deficient plasma and incubate.
• Perform APTT test to measure activity.
• Compare results against standard curves and control samples.
• Calculate Bethesda units to determine the level of inhibitor.
4. Quality Control:
• Include normal control and control with known low and high
inhibitor levels in each run.
• Record all QC results and ensure they are within acceptable limits
before proceeding with patient sample analysis.
C) DATA REVIEW:
1. Result Documentation:
• Enter all results into laboratory information system (LIS).
• Verify that all values are within expected ranges and that QC has
passed.
2. Professional Interpretation:
• Forward results to the designated professional interpreter for
review.
• Include any comments on sample integrity and analysis
anomalies.
3. Reporting:
• The professional interpreter will provide a clinical interpretation
based on the generated data.
• Complete result and interpretation report within the LIS.
• Ensure results are communicated to the attending physician in a
timely manner.
6. RECORD KEEPING
Keep original assay results, QC documentation, and professional
interpretations in both electronic format in LIS and as hard copies for
audit purposes.
7. REFERENCES
Follow the latest manufacturer instructions for assay kits and
analyzers.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to manufacturer guidelines for assay limitations. Ensure there
is no significant hemolysis, lipemia, or icterus in the samples, as
these factors can affect the accuracy of the results.
9. SAFETY
Follow standard laboratory safety procedures including the use of
personal protective equipment (PPE) when handling specimens and
reagents.
10. TROUBLESHOOTING
Refer to equipment and assay manuals for troubleshooting steps and
contact technical support if problems persist.
Note: This SOP is subject to updates and modifications as new
methods and technologies are developed or adopted by the
laboratory. Ensure you are trained on the latest version and familiar
with all protocols and procedures.
