Protocol for Analytical Phase of Factor IX Inhibitor Profile
Technical Interpretation
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedure for
generating results for Factor IX Inhibitor Profile and providing
technical interpretation.
2. SCOPE This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel responsible
for carrying out the Factor IX Inhibitor Profile test and interpreting the
results in the laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY It is the responsibility of all trained laboratory
staff to follow this SOP accurately and consistently. Supervisors are
responsible for ensuring that all staff members are adequately trained
and proficient in this procedure.
4. REAGENTS
• Factor IX-deficient plasma
• Normal pooled plasma (NPP)
• Bethesda reference standards
• Buffer solutions (Tris, HEPES)
• APTT reagents
• Calcium chloride solution (0.025 M)
• Phospholipid reagents
5. EQUIPMENT
• Coagulation analyzer
• Water bath (37°C)
• Timer
• Pipettes and tips
• Centrifuge
• Incubation tubes
6. SPECIMEN
• Citrated plasma (3.2% sodium citrate)
• Volume: Minimum 3 mL
• Transport and storage: The specimen should be transported and
stored at 2-8°C and tested within 4 hours. If testing cannot be
performed immediately, freeze the sample at -20°C or lower.
7. PROCEDURE A) Sample Preparation:
1. Allow frozen plasma samples to thaw completely at room
temperature (20-25°C) and then keep them at 37°C for 5
minutes before testing.
2. Mix the sample thoroughly by gentle inversion to ensure
homogeneity.
B) Assay Procedure:
1. Dilute patient plasma 1:10 with imidazole buffer.
2. Prepare a mix of 1:1 ratio of patient plasma with NPP.
3. Incubate the mix at 37°C for 2 hours.
4. Following incubation, perform the APTT test using the
coagulation analyzer: a. Place a specified volume of APTT
reagent into coagulation cuvettes. b. Add an equal volume of
the incubation mix to the cuvettes. c. Incubate for 5 minutes at
37°C. d. Add 0.025 M calcium chloride to initiate clotting. e.
Record the clotting time in seconds.
C) Interpretation:
1. Compare the clotting times of patient plasma mixed with NPP to
the normal control.
2. Calculate the initial dilution of inhibitor in Bethesda units (One
Bethesda unit/ml is defined as the amount of inhibitor that will
neutralize 50% (one half) of one unit of factor activity over 120
minutes at 37°C).
3. If the patient's plasma shows prolonged clotting times indicative
of a specific inhibitor, further dilutions may be necessary.
4. Utilize the Bethesda assay to quantify the inhibitor’s strength
through serial dilutions and comparison with known standards.
5. Record the results in Bethesda units.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run positive and negative controls with each batch of tests and
document results.
• Ensure all reagents are within their expiration dates.
• Validate all equipment before use and maintain routine calibration.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
1. The Factor IX inhibitor level is reported in Bethesda units per
milliliter (BU/mL).
2. Ensure to document any prolonged clotting times and inhibitor
titers.
3. Laboratory Information System (LIS) must be utilized for result
entry and reporting. Results must be verified by a qualified
technologist and reviewed for accuracy.
10. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
• Less than 0.6 BU/mL: Negative for significant inhibitor
• 0.6 to 1.0 BU/mL: Low titer inhibitor present
• Greater than 1.0 BU/mL: High titer inhibitor present Note:
Reference to clinical history and previous results is critical for
comprehensive interpretation.
11. REFERENCES
• Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines.
• Current literature on Factor IX inhibitor testing methodologies.
By following this protocol carefully, the laboratory can ensure
accurate and reliable results for the Factor IX Inhibitor Profile,
providing essential data for clinical management of patients with
hemophilia or related conditions.
