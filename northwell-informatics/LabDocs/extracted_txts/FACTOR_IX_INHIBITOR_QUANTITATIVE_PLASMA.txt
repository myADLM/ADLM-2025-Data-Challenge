Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for FACTOR IX INHIBITOR,
QUANTITATIVE, PLASMA
1. PURPOSE To provide a standardized procedure for the
quantitative determination of Factor IX Inhibitor in plasma using
an established, validated laboratory method. This procedure will
ensure consistent and accurate results for clinical diagnosis
and patient management.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for
performing the Factor IX Inhibitor assay, recording and analyzing the
data, and reporting the results. The responsibility extends to
maintaining all necessary equipment and materials, as well as
recognizing and addressing any issues or discrepancies in the
procedure.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS Specimen Type:
• Preferred specimen: Citrated plasma (1 part 0.105M sodium
citrate to 9 parts blood).
Collection and Handling:
• Collect blood aseptically in a blue-top vacutainer (sodium citrate).
• Ensure the tube is mixed by gentle inversion several times to
prevent clotting.
• Centrifuge the specimen at 1500-2000xg for 15 minutes at room
temperature to obtain platelet-poor plasma.
• Aliquot the plasma into labeled plastic vials.
• Plasma should be stored at -70°C or lower and can be stored for
up to 6 months. Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
• Thaw frozen plasma rapidly at 37°C before analysis and use
immediately.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Grossly hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
• Specimens that have been stored improperly (e.g., at room
temperature for an extended period).
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES Equipment:
• Platelet aggregometer or equivalent calibrated coagulation
analyzer.
• Refrigerator/freezer (-70°C or lower)
• Centrifuge
• Timer
• Pipettes and tips
• Disposable cuvettes
Reagents:
• Factor IX Deficient Plasma (commercially prepared and
validated).
• Normal Control Plasma.
• Calibration plasma.
• Factor IX inhibitor reagents (available as a commercial kit or
prepared in-house according to validated procedures).
• Reconstitute all reagents as per manufacturer’s instructions and
store at recommended conditions.
1. QUALITY CONTROL Quality Control Material:
• Use quality control materials at normal and abnormal levels.
• Include controls in each run to ensure assay reliability.
Storage:
• Quality control material should be stored as per manufacturer’s
guidelines.
Procedure:
• Perform a quality control for each new batch of reagents and each
new lot of calibration plasma.
• Review control data for trends indicating potential systematic
errors.
1. PROCEDURE Pre-analysis Preparation:
• Allow all reagents and plasma samples to reach room
temperature.
• Ensure all equipment is calibrated and functioning properly.
• Validate all reagents and control materials before use.
Assay Procedure:
1. Dilute patient plasma, normal control plasma, and reagents as
per the kit or method instructions.
2. Mix thoroughly and incubate the mixture at 37°C for the
specified time (usually 60-120 minutes).
3. Perform the specific inhibitory assay based on the laboratory’s
choice of method (e.g., Bethesda assay, Nijmegen
modification).
4. Measure the residual Factor IX activity using the coagulation
analyzer.
5. Compare the residual Factor IX activity of the patient sample to
that of the control or calibration sample using the prepared
standard curve.
Calculation and Interpretation:
• Calculate the inhibitor titer based on the standard curve and the
residual activity.
• Report the Factor IX inhibitor level in Bethesda Units (BU).
Acceptance Criteria:
• Ensure that quality control results are within established limits
before reporting patient results.
• If controls fail, assess the cause, correct the error, and repeat the
assay as needed.
1. REPORTING RESULTS Reporting:
• Enter results into the laboratory information system (LIS) for
review by the technologist.
• Review and verify results, while ensuring the inclusion of
appropriate reference values and comments.
• Report results as number of Bethesda Units (BU).
Reference Intervals:
• Normal Range: <0.6 BU
• High results indicating presence of inhibitors: ≥0.6 BU
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Ensure analysis is conducted at room temperature to avoid
spontaneous denaturation of proteins.
• Interference may occur with hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric
samples.
• Specimen storage and handling play a crucial role in the accuracy
of results.
