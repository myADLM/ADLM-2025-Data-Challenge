Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) FACTOR IX INHIBITOR
SCREEN, PLASMA
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to provide a standardized method for
screening for Factor IX inhibitors in plasma, ensuring accurate and
reliable results.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory personnel to
perform the procedure as outlined, ensure quality control measures
are maintained, and report any irregularities to a supervisor.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type: Plasma Collection: Collect blood in a blue-top
(sodium citrate) tube. Volume: Minimum 2.7 mL of plasma. Handling:
Blood should be mixed gently with the anticoagulant to prevent
clotting. Separation: Centrifuge the sample at 1500 x g for 15 minutes
at 15-25°C to separate plasma from cells within 1 hour of collection.
Storage: Aliquot plasma into a labeled, sterile tube and freeze
immediately at -70°C or colder if not tested within 4 hours. Avoid
multiple freeze-thaw cycles.
1. REAGENTS, EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
Reagents:
• Buffered saline (0.85% NaCl)
• Calcium chloride solution (0.025 mol/L)
• Commercial Factor IX-deficient plasma reagent
• Control plasma
Equipment:
• Precision pipettes and tips
• Centrifuge capable of 1500 x g
• Water bath or heating block
• Incubator set at 37°C
• Coagulometer
Supplies:
• Blue-top (sodium citrate) blood collection tubes
• Sterile transfer pipettes
• Labeled, sterile storage tubes
1. PROCEDURE
Preparation
• Thaw plasma samples rapidly in a 37°C water bath and then
maintain at room temperature. Do not leave samples at 37°C for
an extended period.
Screening Procedure:
1. Prepare a 1:10 dilution of patient plasma in buffered saline.
2. Incubate 100 µL of the diluted plasma with 100 µL of Factor IX-
deficient plasma at 37°C for 2 hours.
3. Following incubation, add 100 µL of calcium chloride solution to
initiate the clotting process.
4. Measure the clotting time using a coagulometer according to
the manufacturer’s instructions.
5. Compare the results with normal control plasma treated
similarly.
6. If the clotting time is significantly prolonged, confirming the
presence of Factor IX inhibitors, proceed with titration studies to
quantify the inhibitor level (Bethesda assay).
7. QUALITY CONTROL
Control Plasma:
• Run a known negative control with each batch of tests to ensure
the accuracy of the test system.
• Run an appropriate positive control at least once per day of
testing or with each batch of tests.
Quality Control Results:
• Document all control results in the appropriate log book.
• Results must fall within established control ranges; if out of range,
repeat the assay and/or troubleshoot before reporting patient
results.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Factor IX Inhibitor Screen results are reported as either "positive"
or "negative".
• For screening tests indicating potential presence of inhibitors,
report results as "Inhibitor screening test positive. Titration studies
are recommended."
• In cases of both positive screens, provide results promptly to the
ordering clinician to ensure timely management of the patient.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Normal reference range for a Factor IX inhibitor screen is a
clotting time consistent with the control or 1.0 Bethesda Unit (BU)
for quantitative assays.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Improper specimen collection, handling, or storage can affect test
results.
• Hemolysis or a grossly lipemic or icteric sample may interfere with
the assay.
• Factor IX inhibitors at low titers may be undetected by the
screening test and should be confirmed with quantitative assay if
clinical suspicion remains high.
