Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Factor IX Known Mutation Sequencing
1. PURPOSE
This procedure outlines the analytical steps and quality control
measures required to generate and verify results for Factor IX known
mutation sequencing.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all personnel involved in the sequencing of the
Factor IX gene for identifying known mutations in the laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the trained laboratory personnel to follow this
SOP accurately for the analysis of Factor IX known mutation
sequencing. Quality control and validation of results fall under the
responsibility of the designated laboratory supervisor.
4. DEFINITIONS
Factor IX: A protein that plays a key role in blood coagulation. Known
Mutation: Previously identified genetic mutations in the Factor IX
gene.
5. PROCEDURE
A. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies
• Thermal Cycler
• Microcentrifuge
• PCR tubes
• Sequencing reagents (e.g., primers, dNTPs, polymerase, buffer)
• Sequencing kit (e.g., BigDye Terminator v3.1 Kit)
• Capillary electrophoresis instrument (e.g., ABI PRISM 310
Genetic Analyzer)
• Sequencing analysis software
• DNA extraction kit/material
• Sterile water
• Ethanol 70%
• Pipettes and tips (filtered tips to prevent contamination)
• Positive and negative controls for Factor IX known mutations
B. Sample Preparation
1. DNA Extraction:
◦ Extract DNA from the received specimen using a DNA
extraction kit/material as per the manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Perform quality and concentration assessment of extracted
DNA using spectrophotometry (e.g., NanoDrop) or Qubit
fluorometer.
◦ DNA should be kept at -20°C until use.
2. PCR Amplification:
◦ Prepare the PCR master mix containing primers specific to
the regions of the Factor IX gene where known mutations
are present.
◦ Add the DNA template to the PCR mix and run in the
thermal cycler under the following conditions:
▪ Initial Denaturation: 95°C for 5 minutes
▪ 35 Cycles:
▪ Denaturation: 95°C for 30 seconds
▪ Annealing: 55-60°C for 30 seconds (depending on
primer Tm)
▪ Extension: 72°C for 45 seconds
▪ Final Extension: 72°C for 7 minutes
◦ Verify PCR products by running an aliquot on an agarose
gel electrophoresis.
C. Sequencing Reaction
1. Sequencing:
◦ Clean the PCR products using a preferred purification
method (e.g., exonuclease treatment or DNA cleanup kit).
◦ Set up sequencing reactions with the purified PCR products
using the BigDye Terminator v3.1 Kit following the
manufacturer's instructions.
◦ Thermal cycling conditions for sequencing:
▪ Initial Denaturation: 96°C for 1 minute
▪ 25 Cycles:
▪ Denaturation: 96°C for 10 seconds
▪ Annealing: 50°C for 5 seconds
▪ Extension: 60°C for 4 minutes
◦ Purify the sequencing products to remove unincorporated
dye terminators using the recommended purification method
(e.g., ethanol precipitation).
2. Capillary Electrophoresis:
◦ Load purified sequencing products onto the capillary
electrophoresis instrument.
◦ Run samples according to instrument guidelines to obtain
sequencing data.
D. Data Analysis
1. Sequence Data Analysis:
◦ Import raw sequencing data into the sequencing analysis
software.
◦ Align sequences to the reference Factor IX gene sequence
and analyze for known mutations.
◦ Each sequence should be reviewed and confirmed
manually, checking for quality and consistency.
2. Controls:
◦ Analyze positive and negative controls to validate the
sequencing run.
◦ Positive controls must show the expected mutations, and
negative controls must not show any nonspecific
amplification or mutations.
E. Quality Control and Documentation
1. Quality Control:
◦ Ensure all reagents and instruments are within their
specified expiry dates and functioning correctly.
◦ Document all steps, reagents, and observations in the
sequencing run log.
2. Documentation:
◦ Record the specimen identification, DNA concentration,
PCR conditions, sequencing conditions, and analysis
results.
◦ Maintain sequencing run records and QC results for future
reference.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
• Verified results should be reviewed by a qualified laboratory
technologist before being reported.
• Any critical deviations or issues encountered during the
sequencing should be reported to the supervisor immediately.
• Results must include a detailed report of the mutation status of
the Factor IX gene, referencing known mutations.
7. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions for PCR and sequencing kits.
• Guidelines for sequencing and quality control procedures as per
CAP/CLIA regulations.
• Peer-reviewed literature on Factor IX known mutations and
sequencing methods.
8. REVIEW AND REVISION
This SOP should be reviewed annually or as needed to incorporate
any advances in technology, new guidelines, or critical incidents
reported. All revisions must be documented and communicated to all
relevant laboratory personnel.
