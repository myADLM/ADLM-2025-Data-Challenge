SOP for Factor IX Analysis in Plasma
1. Purpose
To provide a standardized procedure for the accurate and timely
analysis of Factor IX levels in plasma samples. This ensures
reliability and reproducibility in results that support clinical diagnostic
decisions.
2. Responsibility
It is the responsibility of all qualified laboratory personnel to follow the
procedures outlined in this document for the analytical phase of
Factor IX testing. Laboratory supervisors are responsible for ensuring
adherence to this procedure and for addressing any deficiencies or
issues.
3. Definitions
Factor IX: A plasma protein that is essential for blood clotting.
Deficiency or malfunction of Factor IX can lead to bleeding disorders
such as Hemophilia B.
Analytical Phase: The phase in the laboratory testing process that
involves the actual processing and analysis of specimens after they
have been received and logged.
4. Specimen Requirements
• Preferred Specimen: Plasma collected in 3.2% sodium citrate
anticoagulated tubes.
• Specimen Volume: Minimum 1 mL of plasma.
• Specimen Handling: Samples should be centrifuged at 1500 g
for 15 minutes to obtain platelet-poor plasma. Plasma should be
promptly frozen at -20°C or lower if testing is not immediate.
5. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies
• Coagulation Analyzer: (e.g., Sysmex CS-5100)
• Reagents:
◦ Factor IX Deficient Plasma: Commercially available,
lyophilized.
◦ ACT (Activated Coagulation Time) Reagent: Commercially
provided.
◦ Calcium Chloride: 0.025M solution.
• QC Materials: Normal and abnormal control plasmas.
• Pipettes and tips, Sample cups.
6. Procedure
6.1 Calibration and Quality Control
• Perform calibration using manufacturer-provided quality control
materials according to manufacturer's instructions.
• Run normal and abnormal controls with each batch of patient
samples and verify that quality control results meet set
acceptance criteria.
6.2 Patient Sample Analysis
• Preparation:
◦ Thaw frozen plasma samples rapidly in a 37°C water bath.
◦ Mix thoroughly but gently to avoid foam formation.
• Process:
1. Load sample cups with appropriate patient plasma on
coagulation analyzer.
2. Add 100 µL of Factor IX Deficient Plasma to the sample cup.
3. Add 100 µL of ACT Reagent to the cup.
4. Incubate the reaction mixture at 37°C for 5 minutes.
5. Initiate the clotting reaction by adding 100 µL of Calcium
Chloride solution.
6. Record the coagulation time using the coagulation analyzer.
7. Calculation and Interpretation of Results
• The coagulation analyzer will compare the patient plasma to a
standard curve, transforming coagulation times into Factor IX
activity, expressed as a percentage of normal.
• Typical reference range for Factor IX activity: 60-150% of normal.
8. Reporting Results
• Review all patient results for accuracy before reporting.
• Document any unusual findings or discrepancies.
• Report results electronically via the LIS system, ensuring that any
critical values are communicated to the referring clinician as per
laboratory policy.
9. Critical Results
• Critical low Factor IX result: < 20% of normal.
• Immediately notify the calling physician of critical results and
document the communication in the laboratory information
system.
10. Quality Control and Assurance
• Quality control material must be run at least once daily, or with
each batch of tests, to ensure the accuracy of results.
• Instrument maintenance and troubleshooting should follow
manufacturer guidelines.
• Review and document all QC results. Address and resolve out-of-
control conditions before reporting patient results.
11. Method Limitations
• Hemolysis, lipemia, and icterus may interfere with accurate
results.
• Samples that are inadequately anticoagulated may lead to
erroneous results.
12. References
• Manufacturer's instructions for use of the coagulation analyzer
and reagents.
• Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines on
coagulation testing.
• Laboratory specific guidelines and policies.
By adhering to these procedures, our laboratory ensures accurate
and reliable Factor IX plasma analysis, supporting appropriate and
timely clinical decision-making.
