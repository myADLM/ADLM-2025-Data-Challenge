Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Factor VIII Inhibitor
Evaluation, Plasma
1. PURPOSE:
The purpose of this protocol is to outline the analytical phase of
producing accurate and reliable results for Factor VIII Inhibitor
Evaluation in plasma samples.
2. RESPONSIBILITY:
It is the responsibility of the laboratory personnel to follow this SOP
and ensure the proper handling, processing, and analysis of the
plasma samples for Factor VIII Inhibitor Evaluation.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS:
Specimen Type:
• Plasma, collected in sodium citrate tubes (light blue top).
Specimen Volume:
• A minimum of 3 mL of plasma is required.
Handling and Processing:
• Centrifuge the collected blood at 1500-2000 x g for 15 minutes at
room temperature.
• Transfer plasma into appropriately labeled plastic aliquot tubes.
• Plasma should be processed as soon as possible to avoid
activation of clotting factors. If immediate analysis is not possible,
freeze the plasma at -70°C or lower.
4. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS:
Equipment:
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes and tips
• Analytical balance
• Water bath or heating block (37°C)
• Plate reader capable of measuring optical density (OD) at
appropriate wavelengths
Reagents:
• Factor VIII deficient plasma
• Normal pooled plasma
• Bethesda assay reagents (to measure Factor VIII activity)
• Buffered saline or appropriate dilution buffer
• Factor VIII control plasma (low, normal, and high levels)
5. PROCEDURE:
A. Reagent Preparation:
1. Prepare Factor VIII deficient plasma and Normal pooled plasma
as per manufacturer's instructions.
2. Ensure all reagents and control plasmas are at room
temperature before use.
B. Bethesda Assay:
1. Preparation of Dilutions:
◦ Prepare serial dilutions of patient plasma with dilution buffer.
◦ Include a blank and a control sample with each run.
2. Mixing:
◦ Mix equal volumes of the plasma dilutions with normal
pooled plasma.
◦ Incubate the mixtures at 37°C for 2 hours.
3. Assay Initiation:
◦ After incubation, perform Factor VIII activity assay using
prepared mixtures.
◦ Add Factor VIII substrate to each mixture and measure the
Factor VIII activity using a plate reader.
◦ Calculate the residual Factor VIII activity by comparing the
OD values of mixtures with the standard curve for Factor
VIII activity.
4. Calculation of Inhibitor Units:
◦ A residual Factor VIII activity of 50% corresponds to 1
Bethesda Unit (BU).
◦ Calculate the inhibitor levels in BU/ml using the residual
activity results.
C. Quality Control:
1. Run Factor VIII control plasma (low, normal, and high) with
each batch of tests.
2. Control plasma results should be within established ranges.
3. Maintain a Quality Control log and review periodically.
D. Troubleshooting:
1. If control plasma results fall outside the established range, re-
evaluate the procedure, equipment, and reagents before patient
samples are reported.
2. Ensure all equipment is calibrated and functioning properly.
6. REPORTING RESULTS:
1. Record the results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
along with appropriate quality control data.
2. Report results in Bethesda Units (BU).
3. Include any pertinent comments or notes that might affect the
interpretation of results.
7. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
1. Hemolysis, lipemia, and icterus in the plasma samples can
interfere with the assay and lead to inaccurate results.
2. Improper handling and storage of reagents and specimens can
compromise the integrity of the results.
8. REFERENCES:
• Manufacturer's instructions for reagents and controls.
• CLSI guidelines for Factor VIII Inhibitor Assays.
9. SAFETY:
• Adhere to all laboratory safety protocols and guidelines.
• Wear appropriate PPE when handling blood specimens and
reagents.
• Dispose of all biohazardous materials according to established
waste disposal procedures.
