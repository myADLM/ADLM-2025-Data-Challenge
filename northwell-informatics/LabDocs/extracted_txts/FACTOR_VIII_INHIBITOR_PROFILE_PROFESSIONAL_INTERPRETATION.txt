Standard Operating Procedure: Analytical Phase
Protocol for Generating Results for Factor VIII Inhibitor
Profile, Professional Interpretation
1. PURPOSE
To accurately determine the presence and quantification of Factor
VIII (FVIII) inhibitors in patient plasma, enabling informed clinical
decisions through professional interpretation.
2. SCOPE
This SOP is applicable to all designated staff responsible for
performing and reviewing results for the Factor VIII Inhibitor Profile in
a CLIA-certified laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITIES
• Designated Technologists: Perform the FVIII Inhibitor assay and
ensure the accuracy and reliability of results.
• Supervisors: Review and authorize the results, ensure
compliance with SOPs, and oversee corrective actions.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred Specimen: Citrated plasma (light blue top tube)
collected according to standard procedures.
• Volume: A minimum of 1.0 mL plasma is required.
• Handling: Specimen must be centrifuged at 1500xg for 15
minutes. Plasma should be separated and frozen if not tested
within 4 hours of collection.
• Storage: Samples should be stored at -70°C.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• FVIII assay kits
• Calibrated microplate reader
• Calibrated automated pipettes
• Controls and standards specific to FVIII inhibitors
• Incubator set at 37°C
• Reagents: Buffered saline, FVIII-deficient plasma, FVIII
concentrate
6. PROCEDURE
1. Preparation:
• Thaw plasma samples, controls, and calibrators at 37°C for 5-10
minutes ensuring complete mixing.
• Prepare assay reagents as per kit insert and manufacturer’s
instructions.
2. Assay Execution:
• Perform a Bethesda assay:
1. Mix patient plasma with excess FVIII in a 1:1 ratio.
2. Incubate at 37°C for 2 hours.
3. Measure residual FVIII activity using a chromogenic or clot-
based assay.
3. Calculating Bethesda Units:
1. Determine the residual FVIII activity in both patient and control
samples.
2. Plot residual activity versus the concentration of the inhibitor.
3. Calculate the inhibitor titer using the Bethesda method (1
Bethesda Unit = amount of inhibitor that neutralizes 50% of
FVIII activity in normal plasma).
4. Quality Control:
• Run known positive and negative controls with each batch of
tests.
• Repeat tests if controls fall outside established ranges.
5. Data Analysis:
• Record all data in the provided worksheet.
• Verify the linearity and accuracy of the generated assay data.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Review and Interpretation:
• Review all raw data and control charts.
• Validate that results are within the established acceptance criteria.
• Perform calculations for Bethesda Units.
2. Professional Interpretation:
• Interpreting technologist reviews the results considering patient
history.
• Generate a report including quantitative results and professional
interpretation.
3. Critical Results Reporting:
• Any critical findings indicating a high level of FVIII inhibitors must
be reported immediately to the physician.
4. Documentation and Verification:
• Ensure that all steps, calculations, and results are documented
accurately.
• Final results should be cross-verified by another technologist or
supervisor.
8. MAINTENANCE AND CALIBRATION
• Regularly calibrate instruments and pipettes as per the
manufacturer’s guidelines.
• Maintain a logbook for all equipment, including the date of last
calibration and maintenance services.

By adhering to this SOP, we ensure accurate, reliable, and timely
results for Factor VIII Inhibitor Profile testing, enabling effective
clinical management of patients.
