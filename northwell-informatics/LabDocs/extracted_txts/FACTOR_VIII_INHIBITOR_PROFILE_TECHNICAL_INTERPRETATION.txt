STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP) Factor VIII Inhibitor
Profile, Technical Interpretation
1. PURPOSE
This SOP provides procedural guidance for the analysis,
interpretation, and verification of the Factor VIII Inhibitor Profile to
ensure accurate and reliable results.
1. SCOPE
This procedure is applicable to the medical laboratory staff trained to
perform Factor VIII Inhibitor testing.
1. PRINCIPLE
Factor VIII Inhibitor testing primarily involves a Bethesda assay to
detect and quantify the presence of inhibitors against Factor VIII in
patient plasma. The assay results are interpreted considering test
controls, patient history, and technical limits of the assay.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
Laboratory technologists are responsible for performing the test,
analyzing data, and entering results. Supervisors provide oversight
and ensure proper training and adherence to the SOP.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred: Citrated plasma
• Volume: Minimum 1-2 mL
• Stability: Ensure plasma is promptly frozen at -70°C if not tested
immediately. Prolonged storage should be minimized.
• Rejection Criteria: Improperly labeled specimens, clotted
specimens, hemolyzed specimens, and those with improper
storage.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Platelet-poor plasma
• Factor VIII-deficient plasma (commercially available or prepared
in-house)
• Normal control plasma
• Factor VIII standard and inhibitors
• Thromboplastin reagent
• Calibrated pipettes
• Manual or automated coagulation analyzer
• Calibrated stopwatches and timers
• Documentation log
1. PROCEDURE
7.1 Reagent Preparation:
• Thaw required volumes of deficient and normal control plasma at
37°C.
• Prepare serial dilutions of patient plasma with normal control
plasma in appropriate ratios.
• Prepare working solutions of Factor VIII standard and reagents
according to manufacturer instructions.
7.2 Sample and Control Preparation:
• Mix patient plasma, normal control plasma, and Factor VIII-
deficient plasma at desired ratios.
• Include a blank containing only normal control plasma.
• Incubate mixtures for 2 hours at 37°C to allow inhibitor interaction.
7.3 Assay Execution:
• Standardize the coagulation analyzer as per manufacturer
instructions.
• Add thromboplastin reagent to the mixtures.
• Measure clotting times for each mixture and record data.
7.4 Calculation and Technical Verification:
• Utilize the Bethesda formula: (Patient sample time/control sample
time) - 1 × dilution factor.
• Plot clotting times against dilution factors on a logarithmic scale to
calculate inhibitory units.
• Control results must fall within previously established ranges for
test validation.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run at least two levels of internal controls (negative and positive)
with each batch of tests.
• Ensure that control values are within acceptable ranges before
validating patient results.
• Investigate and document any out-of-range controls, repeating
assays if necessary.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Critical Results: Immediately inform the supervising technologist
and the clinician of critical inhibitor levels.
• Enter data into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Document the date, time, and technologist initials for each test
performed.
• Include any interpretative comments based on test results and
patient history.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Sensitivity may vary based on reagent selection and equipment
used.
• Presence of other clotting inhibitors or proteins in patient plasma
may interfere with accurate measurement.
• High Factor VIII levels can mask low titer antibodies.

1. DOCUMENTATION
Maintain detailed records of all calibrations, control runs, test results,
and any deviations according to laboratory policy.
By adhering to these procedures, analytical accuracy and
consistency for the Factor VIII Inhibitor Profile are maintained,
ensuring high-quality patient care.
