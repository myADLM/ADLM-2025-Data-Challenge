Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for FACTOR VIII INHIBITOR, QUANTITATIVE,
PLASMA
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is to
outline the analytical process and ensure the accurate and precise
quantitation of Factor VIII Inhibitor levels in plasma samples received
in the laboratory. This procedure includes guidelines for testing, data
analysis, documentation, and reporting of results.
Responsibility:
• It is the responsibility of designated laboratory staff to perform the
analysis, manage quality control, and report the results following
this SOP.
• Laboratory supervisors are responsible for reviewing and
ensuring compliance with the SOP.
1. DEFINITION
The Factor VIII Inhibitor test, also known as Bethesda Assay, is used
to detect and quantify inhibitors against Factor VIII in plasma. This
test is essential for patients with hemophilia A and other related
conditions.
1. REAGENTS, SUPPLIES, AND EQUIPMENT
• Reagents:
◦ Bethesda Buffer
◦ Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA)
◦ Normal pooled plasma
◦ Factor VIII Deficient Plasma
◦ Specific inhibitor plasma (control)
◦ Factor VIII reagent
• Supplies:
◦ Microcentrifuge tubes
◦ Pipettes and tips
◦ Plate reader compatible with Factor VIII assay kits
◦ Calibrated analytical balance
• Equipment:
◦ Incubator set at 37°C
◦ Plate shaker
◦ Spectrophotometer or ELISA reader
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred Specimen: Citrated plasma
• Collection and Handling:
◦ Collect at least 2 mL of venous blood into a sodium citrate
anticoagulated tube.
◦ Centrifuge the specimen at 1500 x g for 15 minutes at room
temperature to remove cellular components.
◦ Aliquot the plasma into a labeled microcentrifuge tube and
freeze at -70°C if not analyzed immediately.
1. PROCEDURE
• Assay Setup:
◦ Ambient temperature: 20-25°C
◦ Incubator temperature: 37°C
• Day 1:
◦ Thaw the frozen plasma samples in a 37°C water bath.
◦ Prepare the Bethesda buffer, BSA solution, and control
plasmas as per manufacturer instructions.
◦ Dilute patient and normal pooled plasmas as necessary with
factor VIII deficient plasma.
• Incubation:
◦ Mix equal volumes (0.5 mL) of patient plasma and normal
pooled plasma in microcentrifuge tubes.
◦ Prepare a negative control by mixing 0.5 mL of normal pooled
plasma with 0.5 mL of factor VIII deficient plasma.
◦ Incubate all tubes in the incubator at 37°C for 2 hours.
• Assay:
◦ Add 0.5 mL of the Factor VIII reagent to each incubation
mixture.
◦ Incubate for an additional 30 minutes at 37°C.
◦ Perform the Factor VIII activity assay as per the standard
operating procedure using a plate reader to measure
absorbance at the relevant wavelength.
• Calculation:
◦ Determine Factor VIII activity from the standard curve using
the absorbance readings.
◦ Calculate the Bethesda units using the formula: (100% -
observed activity %) / observed activity % 0 BU = >50% factor
VIII activity 1 BU = 50% factor VIII activity
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Internal Quality Control:
◦ Run specific inhibitor controls and normal pooled plasma as
controls with each run.
◦ Acceptable control ranges must be established and adhered to
as per laboratory quality control standards.
• Quality Control Logging:
◦ Document all control results and actions taken for out-of-range
controls in the Quality Control Log maintained in the
laboratory.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Review and verify results obtained from the assay.
• Report results in Bethesda Units (BU) with proper notation
regarding the detection limits.
• Document findings, including any relevant comments on the
sample integrity or discrepancies observed during testing.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Test performance may be affected by lipemia, icterus, or
hemolysis.
• High titer inhibitors may result in overestimation of titers if
excessive dilution is required.
• Potential interfering substances should be noted and results
interpreted accordingly.
