Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analysis of Factor VIII in
Plasma
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the analytical procedure for
measuring Factor VIII levels in plasma. Factor VIII is a blood clotting
protein crucial for the management of hemophilia A and other
bleeding disorders. Accurate measurement of Factor VIII levels is
essential for diagnosis and treatment.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the Factor
VIII assay, documenting results and any corrective actions as defined
in this procedure. Supervisors ensure that the procedure is followed
and that all results are validated and reported correctly.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen Type:
• Preferred specimen: Citrated plasma
Specimen Collection:
• Blood should be collected in a sodium citrate tube (light blue top).
• After collection, mix gently to ensure anticoagulation.
• Centrifuge at 2000-2500g for 10-15 minutes at room temperature
to separate plasma.
• Transfer the plasma to a clean, labeled polypropylene tube.
Specimen Storage:
• Plasma samples should be stored at 2-8°C if analysis is to be
done within 4 hours.
• For longer storage, freeze plasma at -20°C or lower.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed specimens
• Specimens collected in citrate tubes that are not properly filled
• Specimens that have been improperly stored or handled
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Plate reader capable of measuring optical density at 450 nm
• Microcentrifuge
• Pipettes (calibrated)
Reagents:
• Factor VIII Assay Kit (store according to manufacturer
instructions)
• Quality control material from a validated source
Supplies:
• Disposable pipette tips
• Polypropylene sample tubes
• Microplates, unless indicated otherwise by the assay kit
1. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Bring all reagents and samples to room temperature before
starting the assay.
Assay Procedure:
1. Prepare calibration standards as per manufacturer's
instructions.
2. Dilute plasma samples appropriately (dilutions recommended
by the assay kit).
3. Add required volume of plasma sample, standards, and quality
control material to the appropriate wells of the microplate.
4. Add reagents sequentially as indicated by the kit instructions
(usually including an enzyme-linked reagent and substrate).
5. Incubate the microplate at the specified temperature for the
required time.
6. Measure the optical density at 450 nm using the plate reader.
Quality Control:
• Run quality control samples alongside patient samples to ensure
assay performance.
• Document the results of quality control samples and take
corrective actions if QC samples fall outside acceptable ranges.
1. CALCULATION OF RESULTS
Calculate the Factor VIII concentration in plasma samples using the
calibration curve generated from standard samples. Ensure that the
readings fall within the linear range of the assay.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
Results should be reviewed and verified by the technologist before
reporting.
• Factor VIII levels should be reported in IU/dL or percent normal.
• Reference intervals should be provided with the reported result
based on population and assay validation.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the manufacturer's instructions for individual assay
limitations, including potential interferences or conditions that may
impact the accuracy of the Factor VIII measurement.
1. REFERENCES
Include kit manufacturer's instruction manual and any relevant
scientific literature or guidelines pertaining to Factor VIII
measurement.
Note: Before implementing this SOP, verify that it conforms to your
laboratory's standards and practices, any local regulations, and
guidance from professional organizations such as Clinical Laboratory
Improvement Amendments (CLIA) and College of American
Pathologists (CAP).
