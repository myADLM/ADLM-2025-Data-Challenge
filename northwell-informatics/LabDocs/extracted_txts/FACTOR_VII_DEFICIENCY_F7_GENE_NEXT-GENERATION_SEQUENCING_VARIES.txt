Standard Operating Procedure
Title: Analysis for Factor VII Deficiency, F7 Gene, Next-Generation
Sequencing (NGS)
1. PURPOSE To provide a detailed and standard procedure for the
analysis of Factor VII deficiency through the sequencing of the F7
gene using Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS), which ensures high-
quality, accurate, and reliable genetic test results.
Responsibility:
• It is the responsibility of trained laboratory personnel to follow the
procedures as outlined in this document.
• Supervisory staff must ensure that staff are competent in
conducting the procedures and overseeing adherence to the
protocols.
• Quality control and troubleshooting should be managed promptly
to avoid discrepancies.
2. DEFINITIONS Factor VII Deficiency: A rare bleeding disorder
caused by a deficiency or dysfunction of the protein factor VII, which
is encoded by the F7 gene. Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS): A
modern sequencing technology that allows for the rapid sequencing
of large stretches of DNA, such as the entire F7 gene.
3. PROCEDURE
A. Pre-analytical Phase Ensure that the specimen has already been
collected, received, and properly accessioned per standard
laboratory protocols.
B. Equipment and Supplies:
• DNA extraction kit
• NGS library preparation kit
• DNA sequencer (e.g., Illumina or similar)
• PCR reagents
• Thermal cycler
• Bioinformatics software for data analysis
• Quality control materials
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
C. DNA Extraction:
1. Extract genomic DNA from the received blood or tissue
samples using the standardized DNA extraction kit.
2. Quantify the extracted DNA using spectrophotometry (e.g.,
Nanodrop) and confirm the quality via gel electrophoresis.
D. Library Preparation:
1. Prepare the NGS library using the library preparation kit
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Perform a quality check on the prepared libraries using a
bioanalyzer or similar instrument.
3. Quantify the libraries by qPCR or fluorometry.
E. Sequencing:
1. Load the prepared libraries onto the NGS platform.
2. Set up the sequencing run by following the sequencer’s user
manual and enter the required sample details.
3. Start the sequencing run ensuring that all settings match the
requirements for sequencing the F7 gene.
F. Data Analysis:
1. Perform base calling and generate raw sequence data.
2. Conduct alignment of reads to the reference human genome
using bioinformatics software.
3. Identify variants within the F7 gene and annotate using a
variant annotation tool.
4. Assess the quality of data with quality metrics such as
coverage, depth, and read quality.
5. Utilize bioinformatics pipelines to filter, classify, and interpret
variants as pathogenic, likely pathogenic, uncertain
significance, likely benign, or benign.
G. Quality Control and Troubleshooting:
1. Include internal controls (e.g., known positive and negative
controls) in each run to ensure run validity.
2. Perform routine instrument maintenance as per the
manufacturer’s recommendations.
3. Address any discrepancies or instrument alarms according to
the troubleshooting guidelines.
4. For failed runs, identify the possible causes, rectify and repeat
the sequencing run.
H. Result Validation and Reporting:
1. Verify and review the obtained results by a qualified
professional.
2. If variants of interest are identified, confirm the results through
Sanger sequencing if necessary.
3. Interpret results concerning the clinical context provided.
4. Generate a comprehensive report including variant details,
pathogenicity classification, and potential clinical relevance.
5. Communicate and document the results in the Laboratory
Information System (LIS) and ensure that the result is
accurately reported to the referring clinician.
4. QUALITY CONTROL:
• Perform regular proficiency testing.
• Ensure compliance with external quality assurance schemes.
• Regularly audit the entire process to maintain high accuracy and
reliability.
5. SAFETY:
• Follow all biosafety regulations.
• Use appropriate PPE.
• Dispose of all hazardous waste according to the regulations.
6. DOCUMENTATION:
• Maintain detailed records of all procedures, results, and quality
control checks.
• Record any deviations from SOPs, corrective actions taken, and
results of corrective actions.
• Ensure all documentation is reviewed, signed off, and stored
according to laboratory policy.
7. REFERENCES:
• Manufacturer’s guidelines for DNA extraction kit, library
preparation kit, and sequencer.
• Current literature and guidelines on the interpretation of genetic
variants (e.g., ACMG guidelines).
