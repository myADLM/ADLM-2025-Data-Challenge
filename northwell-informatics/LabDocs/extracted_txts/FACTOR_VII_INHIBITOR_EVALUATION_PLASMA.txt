Protocol for Factor VII Inhibitor Evaluation, Plasma
1. PURPOSE
This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) establishes the protocol
for conducting Factor VII Inhibitor Evaluation in plasma specimens.
This ensures accurate and reliable results, which are critical for the
diagnosis and management of patients with suspected Factor VII
deficiency or inhibitor presence.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
All qualified laboratory personnel are responsible for the execution of
this SOP. The laboratory supervisor is responsible for ensuring
compliance and addressing any issues that could affect the accuracy
of test results.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
- **Preferred Specimen:**
- Fresh plasma sample collected in sodium citrate (blue-top) tube.
- The blood should be mixed immediately post-collection by gentle inversion of the tube.
- **Stability:**
- Plasma must be separated from cells within 4 hours of collection.
- Store plasma at -20°C if not analyzed within 4 hours.
- Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
- **Unacceptable Specimens:**
- Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
- Specimens collected in tubes other than sodium citrate.
- Specimens that are not properly labeled.
4. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
- Factor VII Deficient Plasma
- Standard Plasma
- Mixing studies reagents
- Phospholipid reagent
- Calcium Chloride solution
- Buffered saline
- Test tubes, micropipettes, and cuvettes
5. EQUIPMENT
- Coagulation Analyzer
- Centrifuge capable of achieving 1,500 g
- Refrigerated Centrifuge
- Freezer (-20°C or lower)
- Timer
6. PROCEDURE
A) **Preparation of Reagents:**
1. Reconstitute Factor VII Deficient Plasma following manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Prepare Calibrated Standard Plasma.
B) **Sample Preparation:**
1. Centrifuge the collected sodium citrate blood specimen at 1,500 g for 15 minutes to obtain platelet-poor plasma.
2. Aliquot the plasma to a clean, properly labeled tube.
3. Store the plasma at -20°C if testing is not immediate.
C) **Assay Procedure:**
1. Allow all reagents and plasma samples to come to room temperature.
2. Prepare two test mixtures:
a. **Test Mixture 1:** Mix equal volumes of patient plasma and Factor VII deficient plasma.
b. **Test Mixture 2:** Mix equal volumes of normal plasma and Factor VII deficient plasma (control).
3. Incubate the test mixtures at 37°C for 1-2 minutes.
4. Add a predetermined amount of phospholipid reagent to each mixture.
5. Start the coagulation analyzer and follow the instrument’s instructions for inputting reagents, samples, and recording the clotting times.
D) **Analysis:**
1. Document the clotting times for both mixtures.
2. Compare the clotting time of Test Mixture 1 to that of Test Mixture 2.
3. Calculate factor activity based on comparison to standard clotting times.
4. Interpret results:
- A prolonged clotting time in the patient mixture that corrects with addition of normal plasma indicates a potential Factor VII deficiency.
- Lack of correction suggests a potential Factor VII inhibitor presence.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Conduct procedural controls using known control plasma
alongside patient samples.
• Include internal Quality Control (QC) materials in each run.
• Monitor the performance of the coagulation analyzer with daily
QC checks.
• Document all QC results systematically and address out-of-range
values immediately.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
- Ensure accurate transcription from the analyzer to the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
- Report all findings, indicating the presence of any inhibitors or deficiencies clearly.
- Critical results must be communicated to the attending physician immediately and documented as per the laboratory’s critical results policy.
9. REFERENCE INTERVALS
- Normal reference ranges for Factor VII activity will be provided in the test’s package insert or standard laboratory reference materials.
10. METHOD LIMITATIONS
- Hemolyzed or lipemic samples may interfere with assay results.
- Incorrect plasma preparation or storage may invalidate results.
