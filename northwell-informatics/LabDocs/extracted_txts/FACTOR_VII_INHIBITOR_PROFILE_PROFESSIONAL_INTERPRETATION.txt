FACTOR VII INHIBITOR PROFILE, PROFESSIONAL
INTERPRETATION - STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP)
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the analytical procedures for
generating results for Factor VII Inhibitor Profile, including
professional interpretation. This protocol ensures consistent,
accurate, and timely delivery of results.
1. SPECIMEN
Preferred/acceptable:
◦ Plasma collected using 3.2% sodium citrate blood collection
tubes.
◦ Specimen should be centrifuged within one hour of
collection at sufficient speed to achieve platelet-poor plasma
(less than 10,000 platelets/μL).
◦ Freeze plasma at -20°C or lower if analysis is not
immediate.
Unacceptable:
◦ Clotted samples.
◦ Hemolyzed specimens.
◦ Specimens collected in an anticoagulant other than 3.2%
sodium citrate.
2. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES:
◦ Automated coagulation analyzer (e.g., ACL TOP, Sysmex
CA-1500).
◦ Factor VII-deficient plasma.
◦ Standard and sample diluents.
◦ 3.2% sodium citrate blood collection tubes.
◦ Freezer (-20°C or lower).
◦ Controlled thawing device (e.g., 37°C water bath).
3. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Preparation: 1. Ensure the plasma sample is thawed at
37°C for 5 minutes. 2. If multiple tests are ordered on the same
sample, aliquot the necessary volume for each test and store
properly until use.
B. Factor VII Assay: 1. Calibrate the coagulation analyzer as per the
manufacturer’s instructions. 2. Prepare dilutions of the patient's
plasma using the standard diluents. 3. Mix equal parts of patient’s
diluted plasma with Factor VII-deficient plasma. 4. Load the mixture
into the coagulation analyzer. 5. Run the assay and record the
clotting time results.
C. Inhibition Testing: 1. Prepare serial dilutions of the patient’s
plasma in inhibitor diluent. 2. Mix diluted patient plasma with an equal
volume of normal pooled plasma. 3. Incubate the mixtures at 37°C for
120 minutes to allow interaction between inhibitors and Factor VII. 4.
Add Factor VII-deficient plasma to each mixture and measure clotting
times. 5. Compare clotting times to a control without patient plasma
to determine the presence and strength of the inhibitor.
D. Quality Control: 1. Run appropriate quality control samples
(normal and abnormal control plasma) with each batch of patient
specimens. 2. Ensure results of QC samples are within acceptable
ranges before proceeding with patient specimen analysis. 3. If QC
samples are out of range, troubleshoot and resolve any issues before
re-running the QC and patient specimens.
1. DATA ANALYSIS AND INTERPRETATION
1. Calculate the Factor VII activity level using the calibration
curve generated by the coagulation analyzer.
2. Assess the degree of inhibition by comparing the results
from patient dilutions to the control sample.
3. Plot the inhibitor dilution series on a linear graph to
visualize the degree of inhibition.
4. A professional interpretation should be made based on
the clinical history provided, Factor VII activity level, and
inhibitor level.
2. REPORTING RESULTS
A. Results should be recorded and reviewed by a senior technologist
or laboratory supervisor. B. Enter results into the Laboratory
Information System (LIS) along with the professional interpretation.
C. Critical or out-of-range results must be flagged, and the
responsible clinician should be notified immediately following proper
documentation protocol. D. Enter the standard comment for
professional interpretation as per guidelines.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS:
Normal Ranges: - Factor VII activity: 50-150%
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the instrument manufacturer's manual for assay limitations.
Hemolyzed or improperly handled specimens may lead to inaccurate
results. Ensure adherence to specimen handling and testing
protocols to mitigate these issues.

1. DOCUMENTATION AND RECORD KEEPING
All results, including control results and troubleshooting log, should
be documented in the laboratory records. Maintain documentation for
a minimum of two years or in accordance with applicable regulations.
This document outlines the systematic approach for analyzing and
interpreting the Factor VII Inhibitor Profile in a laboratory setting,
ensuring that the process is rigorous, consistent, and compliant with
regulatory standards.
