STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase of Generating Results for Factor VII Inhibitor
Profile, Technical Interpretation
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the steps and procedures for
analyzing and reporting the results of a Factor VII Inhibitor Profile
including the technical interpretation. This procedure ensures that
results are accurate, reliable, and reported in a timely manner.
1. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all technical staff responsible for performing
Factor VII Inhibitor testing in the coagulation laboratory.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the laboratory staff to adhere to this
procedure. The laboratory supervisor or designated individual is
responsible for ensuring compliance and providing oversight.
1. DEFINITIONS
Factor VII Inhibitor Profile: A series of tests performed to detect and
quantify inhibitors against Factor VII, which can interfere with normal
blood clotting processes.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Automated Coagulation Analyzer
• Factor VII deficient plasma
• Normal pooled plasma
• Patient plasma
• Mixing studies reagents
• Chromogenic substrate
• Calcium chloride solution
• Buffer solutions
• Specific inhibitors
• Calibration standards and controls
1. PROCEDURE
A. Pre-Analytical Preparation
1. Ensure all equipment and reagents are calibrated and checked
as per laboratory quality control protocols.
2. Verify patient information and specimen details. Ensure the
specimen is labeled correctly and received within acceptable
time limits.
3. Allow all reagents and patient plasma to reach room
temperature before starting the analysis.
B. Analytical Procedure
1. Perform a preliminary Factor VII activity assay on the patient's
plasma using the automated coagulation analyzer.
2. Mixing Study: a. Prepare 1:1 mixtures of patient plasma and
normal pooled plasma. b. Incubate the mixture at 37°C for 30
minutes. c. Perform the Factor VII activity assay on the mixture.
d. Record the results and compare with the baseline Factor VII
activity.
3. Chromogenic Assay: a. Add chromogenic substrate to the
patient plasma and incubate as per kit instructions. b. Add
calcium chloride solution to initiate the reaction. c. Read the
optical density (OD) at the specific wavelength using the
coagulation analyzer.
4. Inhibitor Titration: a. Prepare a series of dilutions of patient
plasma with buffer solution. b. Add Factor VII deficient plasma
to each dilution. c. Incubate and perform Factor VII activity
assay on each dilution. d. Calculate the inhibitor titre by
comparing with a standard curve and controls.
C. Calculations and Quality Control
1. Calculate the percentage of Factor VII activity in the patient
sample and mixed plasma.
2. Calculate the inhibitor titre using standard equations provided
by the reagent manufacturer.
3. Perform quality control checks using control plasmas with
known Factor VII activity levels.
4. Record all results, including any deviations or issues
encountered during the analysis.
D. Technical Interpretation
1. Compare the Factor VII activity in patient plasma versus normal
pooled plasma: a. Normal activity (>50%): Indicates the
absence of inhibitors. b. Reduced activity: Perform inhibitor
titration to determine the presence and level of inhibitors.
2. Interpret Mixing Study Results: a. Correction (increased activity
in mixture): Suggests deficiency of Factor VII without inhibitors.
b. No correction (no significant change): Suggests the presence
of an inhibitor.
3. Evaluate Chromogenic Assay Data: a. Consistent results with
activity assay support the accuracy of Factor VII levels.
4. Document all interpretations, ensuring clarity and accuracy.
Compare results with reference intervals and note any
significant findings or anomalies.
5. REPORTING RESULTS
6. Review the results and quality control data. Ensure all
parameters meet acceptable limits.
7. Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
Include all relevant technical interpretations and comments.
8. Verify results and release them for reporting to the healthcare
provider.
9. REFERENCES
10. Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines for
coagulation testing.
11. Manufacturer’s instructions and package inserts for specific
reagents and equipment.
12. Current literature and best practices for Factor VII inhibitor
testing.
13. DOCUMENTATION AND RECORD KEEPING
14. Record all temperature logs for reagents and equipment.
15. Maintain detailed logs of all patient results, quality control data,
and any deviations encountered.
16. Ensure all documentation is accurate, complete, and stored in
accordance with laboratory policies.
