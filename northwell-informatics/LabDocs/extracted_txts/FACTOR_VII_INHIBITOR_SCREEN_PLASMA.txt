Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase Protocol for Generating Results for Factor VII
Inhibitor Screen, Plasma
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for analyzing and reporting results for Factor
VII inhibitor screens in plasma samples within the laboratory in
compliance with CLIA regulations.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
This procedure is to be performed by qualified and trained medical
laboratory scientists. It is the responsibility of all supervising staff to
ensure adherence to the protocol and to rectify any deviations that
may occur.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Plasma
• Collection: Blood should be collected in a light blue top tube
containing sodium citrate. Ensure the tube is filled to the correct
volume to maintain the appropriate blood to anticoagulant ratio.
• Specimen Handling: Centrifuge the sample at 1500 x g for 15
minutes to obtain platelet-poor plasma. Aliquot the plasma into a
properly labeled polypropylene tube and store at -20°C if not
tested immediately.
• Stability: Frozen plasma is stable for up to 6 months at -20°C.
Thawed plasma should be used within 4 hours and kept at 2-8°C.
Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Coagulation analyzer (e.g., STA-R Evolution or similar)
• Calibrated pipettes and tips
• Timer
• Factor VII-deficient plasma
• Phospholipid reagent
• Calcium chloride reagent
• Thawing water bath (37°C)
• Laboratory-grade water
• Control plasmas (normal and pathological)
1. PROCEDURE
5.1 Before Starting the Test:
• Calibrate the coagulation analyzer as per the manufacturer’s
instructions.
• Perform daily quality control checks using normal and
pathological control plasmas to ensure the accuracy of the
analyzer.
5.2 Preparing the Sample:
• Thaw aliquots of frozen plasma at 37°C in a water bath, ensuring
the samples are thoroughly mixed before testing.
• Do not vortex the plasma to avoid foam.
5.3 Test Setup:
• Load the coagulation analyzer with the required reagents and
calibrate if not already done.
• Follow the manufacturer’s protocol to input the specific test
parameters for the Factor VII inhibitor screen.
5.4 Performing the Assay:
1. Add 100 µL of the patient’s plasma to 100 µL of Factor VII-
deficient plasma in a reaction cuvette.
2. Incubate the mixture at 37°C for 2 minutes.
3. Add 100 µL of the phospholipid reagent to the mixture and mix
gently.
4. Start the timer and allow the reaction to incubate at 37°C for the
time specified in the assay kit (typically about 2 minutes).
5. Add 100 µL of the pre-warmed calcium chloride reagent to
initiate clotting.
6. The instrument will automatically measure the clotting time.
5.5 Calculating the Result:
• The analyzer will calculate the Factor VII activity by comparing the
patient’s clotting time with a standard curve generated from the
control plasmas.
• The presence of an inhibitor is indicated by a prolonged clotting
time, suggesting reduced Factor VII activity.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include normal and pathological control plasmas in each run to
verify the accuracy and precision of the test.
• If controls are not within the established ranges, do not report
patient results. Investigate the source of the error, take corrective
action, and repeat the testing.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Factor VII inhibitor screen results are usually reported as the
percentage of Factor VII activity. Results may include comments
indicating whether an inhibitor is present based on the criteria
established by the laboratory.
• Critical results or significant findings should be communicated
immediately to the attending physician or requesting clinician,
following the laboratory’s protocol for critical results reporting.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Normal Range: 70-150% for Factor VII activity.
• Interpretation: Decreased Factor VII activity with a suggestive
pattern on mixing studies indicates the presence of an inhibitor.
1. LIMITATIONS
• Ensure proper sample collection and handling to avoid inaccurate
results due to clotting or improper anticoagulation.
• Hemolysis, lipemia, or icteric specimens may impact assay
performance.
1. RECORD KEEPING
• Document all results, QC data, and any anomalies in the
laboratory’s information system.
• Maintain a log of instrument calibration and maintenance records.
This SOP is effective from its date of issue and will be reviewed and
updated as necessary to comply with advancing technologies and
regulations.
