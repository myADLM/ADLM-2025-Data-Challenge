Standard Operating Procedure: Analytical Phase of
Factor VII Testing in Plasma
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for the analysis and generation of results for
Factor VII in plasma samples using automated coagulation
analyzers.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of qualified laboratory personnel to follow this
SOP to ensure accurate and reliable results are generated for the
measurement of Factor VII in plasma samples. The designated
laboratory staff are responsible for performing the tests, verifying
results, conducting quality control (QC), maintaining equipment, and
documenting all necessary information as per this SOP.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred Specimen:
• Freshly collected plasma specimen in sodium citrate (blue-top
tube)
• Plasma must be separated within 30 minutes of collection
• Sample must be frozen and shipped on dry ice if not analyzed
immediately
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Specimens collected in tubes other than sodium citrate
• Specimens with visible hemolysis or clots
• Specimens that have been stored at room temperature for more
than 4 hours
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Automated coagulation analyzer (e.g., ACL TOP, Sysmex
CS-5100)
• Factor VII assay reagent kit (follow manufacturer's specifications)
• Calibrators/Standards
• Quality control materials (normal and abnormal levels)
• Pipettes and tips
• Centrifuge
• Freezer (-20°C or lower)
• Gloves and other personal protective equipment (PPE)
5. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Ensure the analyzer is properly calibrated according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
2. Check that all reagents and controls are within their expiration
dates and have been properly stored.
3. Set up the coagulation analyzer with the appropriate assay
reagents for Factor VII testing.
4. Perform daily maintenance and start-up procedures on the
analyzer as per manufacturer’s guidelines.
Testing:
1. Thaw plasma samples at 37°C in a water bath for a maximum
of 5 minutes or as per SOP.
2. Mix the samples gently to ensure homogeneity.
3. Centrifuge the plasma samples at 1500-2000 g for 10 minutes if
needed to remove any particulates.
4. Load samples, calibrators, and controls onto the coagulation
analyzer.
5. Follow instrument's prompts to initiate the Factor VII test cycle.
6. Ensure quality control runs are acceptable before proceeding
with patient samples.
7. Document any aberrant results and initiate troubleshooting
procedures if QC results fall outside acceptable limits.
Data Analysis:
1. Review the results generated by the analyzer.
2. Verify the Factor VII activity levels against established
reference ranges (typically 60%-140%).
3. Identify critical values and initiate appropriate notification
protocols for critical results.
Quality Control:
1. Run quality control samples at the beginning of the day, after a
new reagent lot is introduced, and at regular intervals
throughout the day.
2. Record QC results in the quality control log.
3. Investigate and resolve any QC failures per manufacturer’s
guidelines and internal troubleshooting protocols.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
• Review all test results for accuracy and consistency.
• Automatically transmit results to the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
• Verify results in LIS before releasing them to clinicians.
• Make sure all critical results are communicated immediately to the
responsible clinician.
7. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Normal reference intervals for Factor VII activity:
• 60%-140%
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolyzed samples may yield inaccurate results and should not
be used.
• Samples collected in tubes other than sodium citrate are not
acceptable.
9. DOCUMENTATION
• Record all maintenance, quality control, calibration, and test
results appropriately in the laboratory logs and LIS.
• Ensure documentation of any deviations, corrective actions taken,
and any instrument troubleshooting performed.

analyzers and Factor VII reagent kits.

This SOP must be reviewed and updated yearly, or whenever there
are significant changes in procedures, reagents, equipment, or
regulations.
