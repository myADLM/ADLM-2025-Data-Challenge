Protocol for Analytical Phase of Testing Factor V Bethesda Units
in Plasma
1. PURPOSE
To provide detailed instructions for the laboratory testing, analysis,
and generation of results for Factor V Bethesda Units in plasma.
Responsibility
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing the
analysis and documenting results according to this protocol. It is the
responsibility of all laboratory staff to report any issues or
discrepancies to the supervisor and ensure proper follow-up actions
are taken.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/Acceptable:
• Freshly collected plasma sample (preferably citrated plasma)
should be separated from whole blood within 2 hours of collection.
• The specimen must be promptly frozen at -20°C or lower if not
analyzed immediately.
Unacceptable:
• Plasma samples that have been hemolyzed or clotted.
• Specimens not separated from the whole blood within the
recommended time frame.
• Samples stored above -20°C prior to testing.
Ensure samples are correctly labeled with patient identification, date,
and time of collection.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• Automated coagulation analyzer or appropriate manual method.
• Factor V-deficient plasma (commercially available).
• Known Factor V inhibitor plasma to serve as control.
• Citrated plasma sample from the patient.
• Normal pooled plasma for calibration.
• Calibrated pipettes and appropriate vials.
Reagents:
• Factor V-deficient plasma
• Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)
• Bovine thrombin
• Calcium chloride solution
Supplies:
• Disposable plastic or silicone-coated test tubes
• Timer
• Mixing devices (vortex mixer, etc.)
4. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation of Reagents and Controls:
1. Prepare phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) before testing
ensuring it is at room temperature.
2. Thaw all reagents and controls needed for the test.
3. Make sure all reagents are calibrated and validated according
to manufacturer's instructions.
B) Testing Procedure:
1. Place thawed patient plasma and thawed Factor V-deficient
plasma in separate labeled test tubes.
2. Mix equal volumes of patient plasma with Factor V-deficient
plasma and incubate for 2 hours at 37°C.
3. After incubation, measure the remaining factor activity using an
automated coagulation analyzer or a manual clotting assay.
4. Compare the activity level to that of the standard curve
generated using normal pooled plasma.
5. Calculate the Bethesda Units by referring to the standard chart
provided for Factor V inhibitor measurement.
Calculation:
• Bethesda Units (BU) = 1 log10 (Residual Activity / 100%)
C) Control:
Include both a high and low control plasma sample with known
inhibitor levels in each assay run to ensure accuracy and precision.
D) Troubleshooting:
• If no activity is measured, verify whether reagents have expired or
if the equipment is malfunctioning.
• If the control values fall outside approved ranges, recalibrate
equipment and reagents before continuing with patient samples.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Perform daily calibration checks and document the temperature
of reagents and control plasma.
2. Run quality control samples alongside patient samples each
day using known high and low Bethesda Unit control samples.
3. Record the results and take corrective actions if any QC sample
results fall outside the established control limits.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Document the Bethesda Unit calculation for the patient sample
and include necessary comments for any observed anomalies.
2. Transmit results to the Laboratory Information System (LIS) for
review and verification.
3. Critical results must be immediately communicated to the
healthcare provider.
7. REFERENCE INTERVALS
The reference interval for Factor V Bethesda Units in plasma is
typically <1 BU. Any value greater than or equal to 1 BU indicates the
presence of a Factor V inhibitor.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the automated coagulation analyzer’s or manual assay's
product insert for any specific limitations regarding the sensitivity and
specificity of Factor V inhibitor detection.
References:
• Reference to the automated coagulation analyzer or manual
assay product inserts.
• Review internal laboratory documents for reagent and equipment
validation.
This protocol is to be reviewed annually or as needed based on
advancements in methodology or changes in regulatory
requirements.
