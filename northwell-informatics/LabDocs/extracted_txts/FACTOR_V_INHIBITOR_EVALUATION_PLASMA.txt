FACTOR V INHIBITOR EVALUATION, PLASMA
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this protocol is to outline the procedure
to evaluate Factor V Inhibitor in plasma samples. This involves
performing relevant tests to ensure accurate and reliable results are
produced and reported.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
• Specimen Type: Freshly collected plasma.
• Collection Container: Sodium Citrate (light blue stopper) tubes.
• Volume: Minimum of 1 mL plasma.
• Handling: Immediately invert the tube gently several times to mix
anticoagulant without causing hemolysis.
• Stability:
◦ Room Temperature: Plasma must be separated from cells
within 4 hours if kept at room temperature for immediate
analysis.
◦ Refrigerated (2-8°C): Plasma can be refrigerated if analysis
will be conducted within 24 hours post-collection.
◦ Frozen (-20°C or lower): For long-term storage, freeze the
separated plasma and avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Centrifuge for plasma separation.
• Automated coagulation analyzer.
• Calibration and quality control materials specific to the analyzer.
• Factor V deficient plasma reagent.
• Control plasmas (normal and abnormal).
4. PROCEDURE
4.1 Sample Preparation
1. Centrifugation: Centrifuge the collection tube at 1500 RCF for
15 minutes at room temperature to separate plasma from cells.
2. Plasma Transfer: Carefully transfer the supernatant plasma
into a secondary labeled tube avoiding the platelet layer, using
a plastic pipette.
3. Freezing (if required): If immediate analysis is not possible,
freeze the plasma sample at -20°C or lower.
4.2 Factor V Inhibitor Test
1. Preparation of Reagents: Allow all reagents and samples to
come to room temperature before use. Prepare diluted patient
plasma using Factor V deficient plasma reagent as per
manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Calibration, if applicable: a. Follow manufacturer’s guidelines
for calibrating the coagulation analyzer. b. Run calibration
materials and verify the analyzer is within acceptable ranges.
3. Quality Control: a. Perform quality control testing using normal
and abnormal control plasmas. b. Document all QC results and
ensure they fall within the manufacturer's specified ranges
before proceeding with patient testing. c. If QC results are out
of range, troubleshoot and resolve the issue before proceeding.
4. Testing Protocol: a. Load the plasma sample, reagents, and
QC materials onto the coagulation analyzer. b. Select the factor
V inhibitor assay from the analyzer’s test menu. c. The machine
will mix plasma with Factor V deficient plasma reagent and
perform the necessary clotting tests. d. The analyzer will
automatically calculate the inhibitor activity.
5. Results Interpretation: a. The analyzer will provide a
quantitative result indicating the presence of Factor V inhibitor.
b. Compare sample results against the reference range.
Typically, a result indicating significant prolongation over normal
control may suggest the presence of an inhibitor. c. Results
requiring further confirmation should be flagged and noted for
follow-up.
5. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Document Results: Results should be documented and saved
in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
2. Review and Verification: Each result must be reviewed and
verified by the technologist before release.
3. Reference Intervals:
Normal Reference Range: < 1 BU (Bethesda Unit) Factor V
inhibitor levels above 1 BU may indicate an inhibitor presence.
4. Communication of Critical Results: a. Immediate
communication to the ordering physician if results indicate high
inhibitor levels. b. Note the time, date, and person contacted in
the laboratory records.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Calibrate the analyzer according to the manufacturer's
recommendations.
2. Run the internal quality control as detailed in Section 4.2.
3. Maintain equipment and reagents in accordance with laboratory
standards to ensure accurate and reliable results.
