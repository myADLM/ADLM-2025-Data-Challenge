Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for FACTOR V INHIBITOR PROFILE,
PROFESSIONAL INTERPRETATION
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this protocol is to outline the procedures for the
analytical phase of generating results for the Factor V Inhibitor
Profile, ensuring consistent, accurate, and reliable results.
Professional interpretation will be provided in accordance with
standard laboratory practices.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
◦ Specimen Type: Citrate anticoagulated plasma (light blue-
top tube).
◦ Volume Required: Minimum 1 mL plasma.
◦ Stability: Plasma should be separated and frozen if
analysis is delayed for more than 4 hours.
◦ Unacceptable Specimens:
▪ Hemolyzed, icteric, or lipemic samples.
▪ Samples not properly labeled.
▪ Samples not received within specified stability time-
frame.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
◦ Equipment:
▪ Coagulation analyzers (e.g., STA Compact Max, BCS
XP, or equivalent).
▪ Centrifuge capable of achieving 1500 x g for plasma
preparation.
▪ Freezer for storing plasma at -70°C.
◦ Reagents:
▪ Factor V deficient plasma.
▪ Normal control plasma.
▪ Factor V clotting activity assay kits.
▪ Thromboplastin reagent.
▪ Calibrated water bath or heating block (37°C).
◦ Supplies:
▪ Pipettes and tips.
▪ Test tubes.
▪ Analyzer-specific cuvettes.
▪ Calibrated timers.
▪ Personal protective equipment (PPE).
1. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Processing
1. Centrifuge the citrate blood sample at 1500 x g for 15
minutes to obtain platelet-poor plasma.
2. Carefully transfer the supernatant plasma to a labeled
plastic tube.
3. If analysis is delayed, freeze the plasma sample
immediately at -70°C.
B. Factor V Activity Assay
1. Thaw the plasma samples rapidly at 37°C and gently mix.
2. Prepare defective plasma and control reagents as per the
manufacturer’s instructions.
3. Calibrate the coagulation analyzer following the laboratory
SOP.
C. Analysis
1. Perform the Factor V activity assay by adding the patient
plasma to Factor V deficient plasma.
2. Measure the clotting time and calculate the percentage of
Factor V activity using the analyzer’s software.
3. Run normal control and defective plasma in parallel to
ensure accuracy.
D. Interpretation
1. Calculate Factor V activity for each sample and control.
2. Measurement units are typically expressed as a
percentage of normal activity.
3. Assess results for Factor V activity levels:
▪ Normal: 70-120%
▪ Mildly decreased: 40-69%
▪ Moderately decreased: 10-39%
▪ Severely decreased: <10%
E. Professional Interpretation
1. Compile data and apply professional interpretation
aligning with clinical indications and patient history.
2. Identify the presence of Factor V inhibitors by analyzing
prolonged clotting times uncorrected by mixing studies.
3. Generate a comprehensive report, including interpretation
and recommendations, prepared by a certified laboratory
professional.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Run quality control samples with each batch of patient
samples.
◦ Ensure reagent validity and analyzer calibration.
◦ Document and review all quality control data to monitor
assay performance.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ Results and professional interpretation will be documented
in the laboratory information system (LIS).
◦ Results shall be reviewed and verified by the technologist
before release.
◦ Critical results will be communicated immediately to the
responsible clinician.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
◦ Factor V Activity: 70-120%
◦ Inhibitory Activity Identification Thresholds: Based on
institutional thresholds for prolongation not corrected by
mixing studies.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
◦ Hemolysis, improper handling, and storage may affect
results.
◦ Cross-reactivity and assay interference can lead to
inaccurate results.
