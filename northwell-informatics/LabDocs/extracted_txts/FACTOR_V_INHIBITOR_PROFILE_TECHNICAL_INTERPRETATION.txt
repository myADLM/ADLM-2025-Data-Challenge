Standard Operating Procedure Title: Factor V Inhibitor Profile,
Technical Interpretation
1. PURPOSE
This document outlines the procedure for the technical interpretation
of a Factor V Inhibitor Profile. This test is designed to assess the
presence and activity of inhibitors against Factor V in patient plasma.
Accurate and timely interpretation is crucial for clinical management.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/acceptable specimens:
• Citrated plasma collected in light blue-top tubes.
• Specimen should arrive in the laboratory within 4 hours of
collection.
• Specimens should be centrifuged promptly at 1500 x g for 15
minutes to obtain platelet-poor plasma, then separated and frozen
at -70°C if not analyzed immediately.
Unacceptable specimens:
• Specimens arriving in the laboratory greater than 4 hours after
collection.
• Specimens that have not been properly centrifuged.
• Specimen tubes that are underfilled, leading to incorrect
anticoagulant ratios.
• Clotted specimens.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Platelet-poor plasma
• Factor V-deficient plasma
• Analyzers (e.g., ACL TOP Family or STA-R Evolution)
• Calcium chloride
• Thromboplastin reagent
• Control plasmas (normal and pathological)
• Pipettes and tips
• Centrifuge
• Water bath (37±1°C)
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation:
• Thaw frozen plasma samples rapidly in a water bath maintained
at 37°C.
• Prepare control plasma samples alongside patient samples to
ensure assay integrity.
• Verify calibrations and pre-analytical checks on analyzers.
B. Test Protocol:
1. Mix 100µL of patient plasma with 100µL of Factor V-deficient
plasma in a test tube.
2. Incubate mixture at 37°C for 3 minutes.
3. Add 200µL of thromboplastin reagent and calcium chloride into
the mixture.
4. Immediately place the mixture into the analyzer and initiate
clotting time measurement.
5. Record clotting time for the patient sample.
6. Perform the test with normal control and pathological control
plasmas. Ensure that controls are within the acceptable range.
C. Interpretation:
1. Compare the clotting time of the patient sample with normal
control values.
2. Calculate the percentage activity of Factor V using the
reference control values.
3. Factor V inhibitor presence is indicated by prolonged clotting
times in the patient sample compared to controls.
4. Consider clinical history, and previous test results for a
comprehensive assessment.
D. Quality Control:
1. Run positive and negative control plasmas with every batch.
2. Document control plasma results and ensure they fall within
established QC ranges.
3. If control results are out of range, investigate potential reagent,
equipment, or procedural issues, and re-run the controls before
releasing results.
4. Document all QC actions in the logbook.
5. RESULT REPORTING
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Review and verify results before final transmission.
• For abnormal results, provide a technical interpretation that
includes the clotting time, activity percentage, and inhibitor
presence comment.
• Notify the ordering physician of critical results according to
laboratory policy.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Reference intervals for Factor V activity: 70-130% Presence of
inhibitors will significantly prolong clotting times beyond this range.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Hemolysis, lipemia, or other sample interferences may affect test
accuracy. Ensure samples are correctly processed and reviewed
concerning potential pre-analytical errors.
