Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase Protocol for Factor V Inhibitor Screen, Plasma
1. PURPOSE
This protocol outlines the procedures for the detection and
quantification of Factor V inhibitors in a plasma sample using an
appropriate clot-based assay. Proper execution of this protocol
ensures accurate and reliable results that aid in the diagnosis and
management of patients with suspected bleeding disorders due to
Factor V inhibitors.
1. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel involved in the analysis
and reporting of Factor V inhibitor screen results in a CLIA-certified
laboratory.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
Laboratory personnel performing the assay are responsible for
following this SOP accurately. It is the responsibility of the laboratory
supervisor to ensure that all personnel are adequately trained and
that the procedures are followed correctly.
1. SPECIMEN
4.1 Preferred Specimen
• Platelet-poor plasma collected in 3.2% sodium citrate
anticoagulant
• Specimen volume: 1.0 mL of plasma
4.2 Unacceptable Specimens
• Samples collected in tubes with other anticoagulants (e.g., EDTA,
heparin)
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples
• Clotted specimens
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Automated coagulation analyzer (e.g., ACL TOP, STA-R)
• 3.2% sodium citrate collection tubes
• Factor V-deficient plasma
• Control reagents (normal pooled plasma, weak positive control)
• Calcium chloride solution (25 mmol/L)
• Pre-warmed incubation water bath (37°C)
• Pipettes and disposable tips
• Timer
• Protective equipment (gloves, lab coat, face shield)
1. PROCEDURE
6.1 Specimen Preparation
• Upon receiving the specimen, ensure it is correctly labeled and
has not exceeded the stability window (within 4 hours of collection
if stored at room temperature, or up to 8 hours if refrigerated)
• Centrifuge citrated blood samples at 1500 x g for 15 minutes to
obtain platelet-poor plasma
• Aliquot the plasma into labeled tubes and keep at room
temperature for immediate testing or store frozen at -20°C for
later analysis
6.2 Assay Set-Up
• Refer to the manufacturer's instrument-specific protocol for setup
instructions
6.3 Calibration
• Perform calibration of the coagulation analyzer according to the
manufacturer's instructions before running patient samples
6.4 Control Testing
• Run normal pooled plasma and weak positive control before
patient samples to ensure the reliability of the assay
• Document the results according to the laboratory's internal quality
control policy
6.5 Factor V Inhibitor Screen Prepare the assay reagents according
to the manufacturer's instructions. The following steps outline a
general procedure, which may need adjusting according to your
specific reagents and instruments:
a. Mix 100 µL of patient plasma with 100 µL of Factor V deficient
plasma b. Incubate the mixture for 1-2 minutes at 37°C c. Add 100 µL
of pre-warmed calcium chloride solution to initiate the clotting
reaction d. Measure clotting time using an automated coagulation
analyzer e. If clotting time is prolonged compared to the control,
proceed to inhibitor confirmation testing using a series of dilutions
1. CALCULATION AND INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
7.1 Calculation
• Calculate the percent correction by comparing the clotting time of
the patient plasma mixed with Factor V-deficient plasma to that of
the normal control plasma: % Correction = [ (Clot time (patient +
Factor V-deficient)) / (Clot time (normal pooled plasma)) ] x 100
7.2 Interpretation
• A result showing less than 50% correction is suggestive of the
presence of a Factor V inhibitor. Further confirmatory testing may
be necessary.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
8.1 Internal Quality Control
• Perform QC testing with each batch of patient samples
• Use normal and abnormal control plasmas daily to monitor assay
performance
• Maintain records of QC results and investigate any failures
8.2 External Proficiency Testing
• Participate in external proficiency testing programs (e.g., CAP
proficiency surveys) to ensure continued accuracy of results
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Document the results in the laboratory information system (LIS)
• Verify results for accuracy and completeness before releasing
• Report abnormal findings immediately to the referring physician
1. REFERENCES
• Instruction manuals for coagulation analyzers used in the
laboratory
• Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines
• Manufacturer’s package insert for reagents used in the assay
By ensuring adherence to this SOP, the laboratory guarantees high-
quality results that support the clinical care of patients with Factor V
inhibitors. The protocol will be reviewed and updated periodically to
incorporate advances in coagulation testing methodologies and
reagents.
