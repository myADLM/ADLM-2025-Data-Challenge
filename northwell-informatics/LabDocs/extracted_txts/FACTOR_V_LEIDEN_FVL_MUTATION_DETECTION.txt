Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) For Analytical Phase of Factor
V Leiden (FVL) Mutation Detection
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to detail the procedures for the analytical
phase of generating results for Factor V Leiden (FVL) mutation
detection in the laboratory. This procedure includes the preparation,
analysis, and documentation steps necessary for the reliable and
accurate detection of the Factor V Leiden mutation.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing the
procedures outlined in this document, ensuring the accuracy and
quality of the test results. Verification of results and appropriate
documentation are also the responsibility of the designated
personnel.
1. DEFINITION
Factor V Leiden (FVL) Mutation Detection is a molecular test used to
identify the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) G1691A in the
Factor V gene, which is associated with an increased risk of
thrombosis. This test typically uses methods such as Polymerase
Chain Reaction (PCR), Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism
(RFLP) analysis, or Real-Time PCR.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation
1. Confirm the receipt of specimens:
• Acceptable specimens: EDTA anticoagulated whole blood or DNA
extracted from peripheral blood.
• Unacceptable specimens: Clotted samples, hemolyzed samples,
or specimens not labeled with the patient identification.
1. Specimen storage:
• Whole blood: Store at 2-8°C if processed within 24 hours;
otherwise, store at -20°C.
• Extracted DNA: Store at 2-8°C for short-term use and at -20°C for
long-term storage.
B. DNA Extraction
1. Perform DNA extraction from whole blood using a commercial
DNA extraction kit following the manufacturer's instructions.
2. Quantify and assess the purity of the extracted DNA by
measuring the absorbance at 260/280 nm using a
spectrophotometer.
3. Store extracted DNA at 2-8°C for immediate use or -20°C for
long-term storage.
C. PCR Amplification
1. Prepare PCR master mix:
• Include components such as PCR buffer, dNTPs, primers specific
for Factor V Leiden mutation, Taq DNA polymerase, and
nuclease-free water.
1. Add appropriate volume of DNA template to the PCR master
mix.
2. Place the reaction tubes in a thermal cycler, and perform the
PCR cycles as follows:
• Initial denaturation: 95°C for 5 minutes
• Denaturation: 95°C for 30 seconds
• Annealing: 55-60°C (dependant on primer set) for 30 seconds
• Extension: 72°C for 1 minute
• Final extension: 72°C for 5 minutes
• Number of cycles: 35-40
D. Detection of Mutation
1. Gel Electrophoresis (For PCR/RFLP method):
• Separate PCR products by agarose gel electrophoresis.
• Visualize bands using UV transillumination after staining the gel
with a DNA-binding dye such as ethidium bromide or SYBR Safe.
1. Restriction Digestion (For PCR/RFLP method):
• Digest the PCR product with MnlI or another appropriate
restriction enzyme that distinguishes between the wild-type and
mutant alleles.
• Analyze the digestion products by gel electrophoresis as
described above.
1. Real-Time PCR Detection (For Real-Time PCR method):
• Prepare the reaction mix including PCR buffer, dNTPs, primers,
probe specific for the FVL mutation, Taq DNA polymerase, and
nuclease-free water.
• Perform the Real-Time PCR amplification using a Real-Time PCR
machine.
• Analyze the amplification data and determine the presence or
absence of the Factor V Leiden mutation based on Ct values and
fluorescence signals.
E. Quality Control
1. Include positive and negative controls in each run to ensure the
accuracy and validity of the test results.
2. Review and interpret the control results before interpreting
patient samples.
F. Interpretation and Reporting of Results
1. Interpretation:
• Wild-type: Absence of G1691A mutation
• Heterozygous: Presence of one normal and one mutant allele
• Homozygous: Presence of two mutant alleles
1. Reporting:
• Document all results clearly, including patient identification, date
of testing, and any observations or deviations from protocol, in the
laboratory information system (LIS).
• Verify and validate the results according to laboratory policies and
guidelines before releasing the results to the ordering physician.
G. Troubleshooting
1. In the event of abnormal control results or failed reactions,
repeat the test run.
2. Investigate potential causes of failure such as reagent
expiration, equipment malfunction, or sample integrity issues.
3. If the issue persists, consult with the laboratory supervisor or
technical support.

7. Peer-reviewed articles and guidelines regarding Factor V
Leiden mutation detection.
8. Laboratory-specific quality control and validation procedures.
9. DOCUMENTATION AND RECORD KEEPING
All steps of the analysis, from DNA extraction to interpretation and
reporting, should be accurately documented in the laboratory
records. Maintain logs of equipment calibration, quality control
results, and all corrective actions taken.
By adhering to this protocol, the laboratory ensures the accurate,
reliable, and timely detection of the Factor V Leiden mutation,
forming a basis for appropriate clinical decision-making.
