Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Analysis of Factor V
Leiden (R506Q) Mutation in Blood
1. Purpose:
To outline the procedure for performing and generating results for the
Factor V Leiden (R506Q) mutation analysis in whole blood samples.
This procedure is intended to detect the presence of the R506Q
mutation in the Factor V gene, which is associated with an increased
risk of venous thromboembolism.
2. Scope:
This protocol applies to all staff trained and authorized to perform
Factor V Leiden mutation analysis in the laboratory.
3. Responsibility:
• Laboratory scientists are responsible for performing the analysis
as outlined in this SOP.
• Supervisors are responsible for reviewing and verifying the
results.
4. Specimen Requirements:
• Specimen type: Whole blood collected in EDTA (lavender top)
tubes.
• Volume: A minimum of 4 mL of whole blood is required.
• Stability: Samples must be tested within 72 hours of collection if
stored at 2-8°C.
• Unacceptable conditions: Hemolyzed, clotted, or improperly
labeled samples.
5. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies:
• PCR thermocycler
• DNA extraction kit
• PCR Master Mix
• Forward and reverse primers specific to the Factor V gene
• Positive and negative controls
• Nuclease-free water
• Microcentrifuge
• Electrophoresis unit and gel documentation system
• Loading buffer
• Agarose and Ethidium Bromide (or other DNA stain)
• Pipettes and sterile pipette tips
• Thermal cycler compatible tubes
6. Procedure:
A. DNA Extraction:
1. Labeling:
◦ Label all reagents, tubes, and pipettes as applicable.
◦ Record all specimen information (accession number,
collection date, etc.) in the laboratory information system
(LIS).
2. Extraction:
◦ Follow the manufacturer’s instructions provided in the DNA
extraction kit.
◦ Carry out the extraction process while preventing any
potential contamination.
◦ Quantify and assess the quality of the extracted DNA using
a spectrophotometer.
B. PCR Amplification:
1. Prepare PCR Reaction Mix:
◦ Prepare the PCR reaction mixture in a sterile environment,
including PCR Master Mix, specific primers, nuclease-free
water, and extracted DNA template.
◦ Ensure that each reaction includes a positive control, a
negative control, and each patient sample.
2. PCR Cycling Conditions:
◦ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 5 minutes.
◦ Denaturation: 95°C for 30 seconds.
◦ Annealing: Temperature specific to primer set (typically
around 60°C) for 30 seconds.
◦ Extension: 72°C for 1 minute.
◦ Final extension: 72°C for 5 minutes.
◦ Hold at 4°C indefinitely until the sample is processed further.
C. Gel Electrophoresis:
1. Prepare Agarose Gel:
◦ Prepare a 2% agarose gel with ethidium bromide.
◦ Pour the gel and allow it to solidify.
2. Load Samples:
◦ Mix PCR product with loading buffer.
◦ Load samples, including controls, into the wells of the
agarose gel.
◦ Include a DNA ladder to estimate the size of PCR products.
3. Electrophoresis:
◦ Run the gel at 100V for 45-60 minutes or until the dye front
reaches an appropriate distance.
◦ Visualize the PCR products under UV light using a gel
documentation system.
7. Interpretation of Results:
• A successful amplification will be indicated by bands of specific
sizes when compared against the DNA ladder and positive
control.
• The presence or absence of specific bands correlates with the
wild-type, heterozygous, or homozygous mutant genotype for
Factor V Leiden.
• Wild-type: A single band corresponding to the normal Factor V
gene.
• Heterozygous: Two bands, one corresponding to the normal and
the other to the mutated Factor V gene.
• Homozygous mutant: A single band corresponding to the
mutated Factor V gene.
8. Quality Control:
• Run positive and negative controls with every batch of samples to
ensure the reliability of the results.
• Document the results of controls and any discrepancies observed.
9. Reporting Results:
1. Verify the results against the control results to confirm accuracy.
2. Report the results in the laboratory information system (LIS)
following site-specific reporting guidelines.
3. Notify the attending physician in case of critical findings or
results requiring immediate attention.
10. References:
• Manufacturer’s instructions for the DNA extraction kit.
• Primer design documents for Factor V Leiden mutation.
• Laboratory internal quality control procedures.
11. Documentation:
• Record all observations, results, and any deviations from the
SOP.
• Maintain detailed records for traceability and audits.
12. Appendices:
• PCR reaction mix preparation guide.
• Gel electrophoresis setup guide.
• LIS result entry protocol.
