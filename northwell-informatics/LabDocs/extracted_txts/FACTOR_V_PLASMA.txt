Title: Analytical Phase Protocol for Measuring Factor V Activity in
Plasma
1. PURPOSE:
To establish a standardized procedure for the measurement of Factor
V activity in plasma samples, ensuring accurate and reliable results
in compliance with CLIA certification standards.
1. RESPONSIBILITY:
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the Factor
V assay and ensuring quality control measures are adhered to. It is
the responsibility of all staff to identify any issues that may affect
laboratory test results and notify a supervisor promptly.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS:
• Preferred Specimen: Citrate-anticoagulated plasma (sodium
citrate tube, light blue top).
• Specimen Collection:
◦ Venipuncture should be performed, avoiding tissue trauma to
prevent activation of coagulation pathways.
◦ Fill the tube to the proper volume (9:1 blood to anticoagulant
ratio).
◦ Invert the tube gently at least 5-10 times to ensure proper
mixing of blood and anticoagulant.
• Specimen Storage:
◦ Plasma should be separated from cells within 4 hours of
collection.
◦ Centrifuge specimen at 1500-2000 g for 15 minutes at room
temperature (18-24°C).
◦ Aliquot the plasma into a plastic tube and freeze at -20°C or
lower if testing is not performed immediately.
• Unacceptable Specimens:
◦ Hemolyzed, icteric, or lipemic plasma.
◦ Samples received beyond 8 hours post-collection without
being frozen.
◦ Incompletely filled tubes or tubes not mixed properly.
1. REAGENTS AND EQUIPMENT:
• Factor V Deficient Plasma, available from commercial suppliers.
• Clotting Reagent (e.g., Calcium Chloride solution).
• Tris-buffered saline or another suitable buffer.
• Quality Control Materials: Normal and deficient control plasma.
• Coagulometer or semi-automatic coagulation analyzer.
• Micropipettes and tips, appropriate for the volume required.
• Plastic tubes for sample and reagent preparation.
• Calibration and maintenance logs for all equipment.
1. QUALITY CONTROL:
• Run quality control materials (normal and deficient control
plasma) with each batch of patient tests.
• Verify that control results are within the established acceptable
ranges before reporting patient results.
• Document all quality control results and any corrective actions
taken if controls are out of range.
1. PROCEDURE:
A) Preparation: 1. Allow all frozen plasma samples and controls to
thaw completely at 37°C and mix thoroughly before use. 2. Prepare
the clotting reagent and buffer as per manufacturer’s instructions. 3.
Ensure all equipment is calibrated and maintenance logs are
complete and up-to-date.
B) Assay Protocol: 1. Pipette a specified volume (e.g., 100 µL) of
Factor V deficient plasma into a plastic test tube. 2. Add an equal
volume of test plasma or control plasma to the deficient plasma. 3.
Incubate the mixture at 37°C for a specified time (e.g., 2 minutes). 4.
Add a specified volume (e.g., 100 µL) of pre-warmed clotting reagent
to the mixture. 5. Start the clotting timer immediately after adding the
clotting reagent. 6. Measure the clotting time using a coagulometer or
manually (if necessary). 7. Record the clotting time and repeat the
procedure for all patient samples and controls.
C) Calculation and Interpretation of Results: 1. Determine the Factor
V activity by comparing the clotting time of the test sample with a
standard curve created using known concentrations of Factor V. 2.
Report the Factor V activity as a percentage of normal activity. 3.
Refer to the table of reference intervals for interpretation: - Normal
range: 50-150% of normal activity. - Reduced Factor V activity may
indicate Factor V deficiency or coagulopathy.
1. REPORTING RESULTS:
• Verify all patient results and quality control outcomes.
• Document results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Provide interpretations based on reference intervals and any
additional comments if needed.
1. SAMPLE STORAGE AND RETENTION:
• Retain aliquots of tested plasma samples in a freezer (-20°C or
lower) for at least two weeks post-reporting for any repeat
analysis or queries.
• Dispose of used reagents and waste materials as per biohazard
waste disposal protocols.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
• Factors such as improper specimen collection, handling, or
storage can significantly impact the accuracy of results.
• Hemolyzed, lipemic or icteric samples can interfere with the assay
and should be avoided.
• Refer to the manufacturer’s product insert for specific limitations
related to the assay reagents and equipment.

Deficient Plasma and Clotting Reagents.

By following this protocol, laboratory professionals can ensure the
reliable and accurate measurement of Factor V activity in plasma
samples, maintaining the high standards required in clinical
laboratory settings.
