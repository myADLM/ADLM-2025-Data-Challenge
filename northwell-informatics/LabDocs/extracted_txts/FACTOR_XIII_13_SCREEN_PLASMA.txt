STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP): FACTOR XIII (13)
SCREEN, PLASMA
1. PURPOSE
To provide clear instructions for the analytical phase of generating
results for Factor XIII (13) screening in plasma specimens. This
document outlines the procedure to ensure accurate and reliable test
results.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel performing Factor XIII
screening in a CLIA-certified laboratory.
3. PRINCIPLE
Factor XIII is essential for blood clot stability. A deficiency can
increase bleeding risk. This protocol describes a manual screening
method using an assay designed to detect low levels of Factor XIII
activity in plasma.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Type: Plasma
• Collection: Blood should be collected in a light blue-top tube
containing 3.2% sodium citrate.
• Volume: Minimum 1 mL of plasma.
• Handling: Centrifuge at 1500 g for 15 minutes to obtain platelet-
poor plasma. Transfer plasma to a polypropylene tube.
• Storage: Plasma should be stored at -20°C if not tested
immediately and can be stable for up to one month.
5. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• Factor XIII assay kit.
• Recommended controls (normal and deficient).
• Platelet-poor plasma.
• 3.2% sodium citrate tubes.
• Micropipettes and tips.
• Calibrated timer.
• Incubator/water bath set to 37°C.
6. EQUIPMENT
• Centrifuge
• Microplate reader
• Calibrated pipettes
• Vortex mixer
7. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation:
1. Ensure all reagents, controls, and samples are at room
temperature before starting the assay.
2. Verify that the incubation system (water bath/incubator) is set to
37°C.
B) Assay Performance:
1. Reagent Preparation: a) Follow the manufacturer’s
instructions to prepare the assay reagents. b) Thaw plasma
samples and controls at room temperature; mix gently using a
vortex mixer.
2. Assay Setup: a) Add appropriate volume of assay buffer to
each well. b) Pipette blank, standard, and quality controls into
designated wells following the assay kit insert. c) Add plasma
samples into the corresponding wells. d) Add the assay reagent
mix to each well and incubate the plate at 37°C for the time
specified in the kit insert (typically 10-15 minutes).
3. Detection: a) Measure the absorbance at the specified
wavelength (typically 405 nm) using a microplate reader. b)
Record and calculate the results by comparing the samples to
the standard curve provided with the assay kit.
C) Quality Control:
1. Include a normal control and a deficient control with each assay
run.
2. Accept results if the controls fall within the established
acceptable ranges.
3. Reject and repeat the assay if controls fall outside acceptable
ranges.
8. CALCULATIONS AND RESULT INTERPRETATION
1. Use formulated calculations in the assay kit insert to determine
Factor XIII activity.
2. Interpret results based on the standard curve.
◦ Normal activity: 70-140%
◦ Deficiency: <70%
3. Record results in the LIS and verify for final reporting.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
• Document all findings in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Verify and review results for quality assurance.
• Report results to the requestor following the established
turnaround time.
10. REFERENCE RANGES
• Normal activity: 70-140%
• Deficiency: <70%
11. LIMITATIONS
• Ensure proper sample collection and handling to avoid clotting.
• Hemolyzed or lipemic samples may affect the accuracy of test
results.
12. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS
• Follow standard biohazard precautions when handling and
disposing of human specimens and assay reagents.
• Wear appropriate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) including
lab coat, gloves, and safety glasses.
13. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s assay kit insert for detailed procedures.
• Current clinical guidelines for coagulation testing.
14. DOCUMENTATION AND RECORDS
• Maintain records of reagent lot numbers, controls results, patient
results, and any deviations or troubleshooting actions taken
during the assay process.
• Ensure traceability and compliance with laboratory standards.
This SOP ensures the thorough, precise, and standardized approach
necessary for accurate Factor XIII (13) screening in plasma,
maintaining high-quality laboratory testing standards.
