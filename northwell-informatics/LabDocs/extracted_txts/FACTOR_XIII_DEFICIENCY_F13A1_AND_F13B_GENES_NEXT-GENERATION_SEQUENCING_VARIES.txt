Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Analytical Phase for
Factor XIII Deficiency, F13A1 and F13B Genes Next-Generation
Sequencing (NGS)
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to ensure the accurate and efficient
analysis of Factor XIII deficiency by sequencing the F13A1 and F13B
genes using next-generation sequencing techniques. This SOP
outlines steps and responsibilities in the analytical phase post
specimen collection and accessioning.
2. SCOPE
This procedure is applicable to all trained personnel performing NGS
for Factor XIII deficiency analysis in the laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated staff are responsible for executing the procedures
outlined in this SOP, including equipment setup, sample preparation,
sequencing, data analysis, result interpretation, quality control, and
reporting.
4. DEFINITIONS
• Factor XIII Deficiency: A rare genetic bleeding disorder
characterized by a defect in the Factor XIII protein.
• F13A1 and F13B Genes: Genes encoding the subunits of Factor
XIII protein, mutations in which can cause Factor XIII deficiency.
• Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS): A high-throughput method
for sequencing DNA, providing comprehensive data on genetic
variants.
5. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
• Automated NGS sequencer (e.g., Illumina, Ion Torrent)
• DNA extraction kits
• Library preparation kits
• Custom gene panels for F13A1 and F13B genes
• Thermal cycler
• Microcentrifuge
• Quantification instruments (e.g., Qubit, Nanodrop)
• PCR machines
• Bioinformatics software
• Quality control materials
6. PROCEDURE
A) Sample Preparation
1. DNA Extraction:
◦ Extract DNA from the provided sample using a validated
DNA extraction kit.
◦ Measure DNA concentration using Qubit or Nanodrop.
◦ Ensure DNA purity (A260/A280 ratio between 1.8-2.0).
2. Library Preparation:
◦ Follow the library preparation protocol specific to the
sequencing platform and gene panel.
◦ Perform PCR amplification targeting the F13A1 and F13B
genes using customized primers.
3. Library Quantification and Normalization:
◦ Quantify the prepared library using Qubit or a similar
system.
◦ Normalize the library concentration according to the
sequencing platform’s requirements.
B) Sequencing
1. Load Samples:
◦ Load the prepared and normalized library onto the
sequencer.
◦ Ensure the instrumentation is calibrated and the reagent is
loaded as required.
2. Run Sequencing:
◦ Start the sequencing run using the manufacturer's
instructions specific to the sequencer.
◦ Monitor sequencing progress and address any instrument
alerts immediately.
C) Data Analysis
1. Raw Data Processing:
◦ Transfer raw sequencing data to the bioinformatics
computer.
◦ Perform initial quality checks using FASTQC or equivalent
software.
2. Alignment and Variant Calling:
◦ Align the sequence data to the reference genome using
appropriate software (e.g., BWA, Bowtie).
◦ Perform variant calling using GATK, VarScan, or another
validated variant caller.
◦ Annotate variants using databases (e.g., ClinVar, dbSNP).
D) Interpretation
1. Variant Interpretation:
◦ Interpret the identified variants using established guidelines
and reference databases.
◦ Use in silico tools to predict the pathogenicity of the
variants.
2. Review:
◦ Verify data integrity and confirm any findings through
secondary analysis if necessary.
◦ Document interpretations and findings.
E) Quality Control
1. Control Samples:
◦ Run quality control samples (positive/negative controls)
alongside patient samples.
◦ Verify that control sample results meet expected outcomes.
2. Validation:
◦ Validate new batches of reagents and equipment regularly
using a control set.
◦ Record and analyze quality control data for trends.
F) Reporting Results
1. Result Documentation:
◦ Document sequencing results clearly, including detailed
variant interpretation and clinical relevance.
◦ Follow site-specific guidelines for reporting results in the
Laboratory Information System (LIS).
2. Critical Results Handling:
◦ Communicate critical findings to the responsible clinician
promptly.
◦ Document the communication process of critical results.
