STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP)
TITLE: Analytical Phase of Generating Results for Factor XIII,
Functional
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to ensure accurate and reliable
measurement of Factor XIII activity in plasma samples. This
measurement is crucial for diagnosing congenital or acquired Factor
XIII deficiency, monitoring patients on therapy, and assessing
hemostasis. This SOP provides a step-by-step guide for the
analytical phase of Factor XIII functional testing.
1. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all clinical laboratory personnel performing
Factor XIII functional assays in the Coagulation Department.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
All designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing
the procedures as outlined and for maintaining the quality and
integrity of the results. It is the responsibility of the laboratory
supervisor to ensure compliance with this SOP.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen:
• Preferred: 3.2% citrated plasma
• Minimum volume: 1 mL
• Collection Instructions:
◦ Collect whole blood in a blue-top sodium citrate tube.
◦ Ensure proper mixing by gently inverting the tube 3-4 times.
◦ Centrifuge at 1500g for 15 minutes to obtain platelet-poor
plasma.
◦ Aliquot plasma into a labeled specimen tube, avoiding the
buffy coat.
◦ Freeze plasma at -70°C if not analyzed within 4 hours of
collection.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
• Samples not transported/refrigerated as indicated.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
Equipment:
• Microplate reader capable of absorbance reading at 405 nm
• Incubator at 37°C
• Pipettes and tips
• Timer
• Plate washer
Reagents:
• Factor XIII functional assay kit
◦ Factor XIII substrate reagent
◦ Calcium chloride solution (0.025 M)
◦ Buffer solution
◦ Negative and positive control plasma
◦ Calibration standard
Storage:
• Store all reagents as per manufacturer instructions.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform quality control with each assay run using both negative
and positive control plasmas.
• Ensure that QC results fall within the specified range provided by
the manufacturer. If QC fails, investigate and correct the issue
before proceeding with patient samples.
1. PROCEDURE
7.1 Preparation
• Thaw frozen plasma samples at 37°C and bring reagents to room
temperature.
• Label microplate wells according to the test layout including
standards, controls, and patient samples.
7.2 Assay Procedure
• Add 100 μL of Factor XIII substrate reagent to each well.
• Add 50 μL of each plasma sample, control, and calibration
standard to designated wells.
• Incubate the plate at 37°C for 30 minutes.
• Add 50 μL of calcium chloride solution to each well to initiate the
reaction.
• Incubate the plate at 37°C for an additional 30 minutes.
• Read the absorbance at 405 nm using a microplate reader.
7.3 Calculation and Interpretation
• Generate a standard curve from the absorbance readings of the
calibration standards.
• Determine the Factor XIII activity of controls and patient samples
using the standard curve.
• Ensure that the calculated activity of controls falls within the
acceptable range before reporting patient results.
• Report patient Factor XIII activity as a percentage relative to the
standard curve.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Enter results into the laboratory information system (LIS) with
appropriate reference ranges (50-150% for normal).
• Review and verify results before releasing them.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Normal range: 50-150% Factor XIII activity.
• Critical values: <30% (requires immediate clinical attention).
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• The assay is sensitive to pipetting errors and inconsistencies in
incubation times.
• Hemolyzed samples may interfere with the results and should be
avoided.
• Refer to the manufacturer's insert for specific reagent limitations.
