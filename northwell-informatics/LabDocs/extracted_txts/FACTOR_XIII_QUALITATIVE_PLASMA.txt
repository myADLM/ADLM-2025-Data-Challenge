Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for FACTOR XIII,
QUALITATIVE, PLASMA
1. PURPOSE
To ensure the reliable and accurate qualitative determination of
Factor XIII activity in plasma samples. This SOP outlines the
analytical procedures involved, including equipment, reagent
preparation, specimen requirements, and reporting results.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of all authorized laboratory personnel to follow
this SOP accurately and consistently. Any deviation or issue
encountered must be documented and reported to the supervisor.
1. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all plasma samples received for qualitative
Factor XIII testing in the Hemostasis Section of the Clinical
Laboratory.
1. DEFINITION
Factor XIII, also known as fibrin-stabilizing factor, is a coagulation
protein involved in the final steps of the clotting process, stabilizing
the formation of the fibrin clot. The qualitative Factor XIII assay
qualitatively assesses whether Factor XIII is functionally present.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred Specimen:
• 3 mL citrated plasma (light blue-top tube)
• The plasma should be separated from cells within 1 hour of
collection by centrifugation at 1500 g for 15 minutes.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or clotted samples
• Samples collected in tubes other than citrated plasma or not
processed within the specified time frame
• Specimens not appropriately labeled with patient information
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes
• Water bath (37°C)
• Timer
• Incubator (37°C)
• Light microscope
Reagents:
• FXIII Test Reagents (specific commercial kit, following
manufacturer’s instructions)
• FXIII positive control
• FXIII negative control
• Calcium chloride solution (0.025 M)
• Factor XIII-deficient plasma
• Normal saline
Supplies:
• Plastic tubes
• Pipette tips
• Gloves, lab coat, and other PPE
Storage:
• All reagents and controls should be stored as per manufacturer’s
instructions, typically at 2-8°C.
• Do not use reagents past their expiration date.
1. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Allow all reagents and controls to come to room temperature
before use.
2. Label test tubes clearly with sample identification numbers.
3. Prepare the controls (positive and negative) and test samples
by adding 0.2 mL of Factor XIII-deficient plasma to 0.2 mL of
the patient plasma into respective tubes.
Reaction Setup: 4. Add 0.1 mL of calcium chloride solution to each
tube to re-calcify the samples. 5. Mix gently and incubate all tubes in
the water bath at 37°C for 30 minutes.
Observation of Clot Formation: 6. After incubation, observe the tubes
for the formation of a clot. An intact clot indicates the presence of
functional Factor XIII. 7. Confirm the results by gently tilting the tubes
to ensure that the clots remain intact, which denotes the stabilization
by Factor XIII. 8. For negative controls, clots should fall apart when
gently tilted.
Microscopic Verification: 9. If initial visual observation is unclear, use
a light microscope to assess the integrity of the clot.
Quality Control: -QC samples should be included in each run. -QC
results must fall within the established acceptable range before
reporting patient results.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Factor XIII Positive: Intact clot formation after re-calcification
• Factor XIII Negative: Clot dissolves upon gentle tilting
Any discrepancy between controls and patient results requires
troubleshooting and repeat testing. Documentation of results should
follow laboratory reporting guidelines, and results should be verified
by a technologist before entry into LIS.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• This assay is qualitative; quantitative levels cannot be
determined.
• Inaccurate results may occur if the sample is not handled properly
or if reagents are expired.
• Factors such as temperature and pH should be tightly controlled.
1. REFERENCE INTERVAL
Positive: Functional Factor XIII detected Negative: No functional
