Analytical Protocol for the Measurement of Factor XII in Plasma
1. PURPOSE
To accurately measure the concentration of Factor XII in plasma
samples using the appropriate immunoassay technique. The protocol
is designed to ensure precise, reliable, and reproducible results in the
clinical setting.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated staff are responsible for executing the assay, adhering
strictly to the outlined protocol. It is the duty of all staff to monitor and
identify any issues in the assay process that might affect the validity
and reliability of results, and promptly report these to the supervisor.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen:
• Preferred/acceptable:
◦ Citrated plasma collected in a sodium citrate tube (blue top).
◦ Venous blood samples should be centrifuged at 1500 x g for
15 minutes within 1 hour of collection to separate plasma.
• Unacceptable:
◦ Hemolyzed samples.
◦ Specimens containing clots or particulate matter.
◦ Plasma samples collected in tubes other than sodium citrate
are not acceptable.
Stability:
• Plasma samples may be stored at 2-8°C for up to 8 hours.
• For longer storage, freeze samples at -20°C or lower, ensuring
samples are thawed only once prior to analysis.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Equipment:
◦ Plate reader capable of measuring absorbance at the required
wavelength.
◦ Centrifuge capable of reaching 1500 x g.
◦ Pipettes ranging between 5 µL and 1000 µL.
• Reagents:
◦ Factor XII calibration standard.
◦ Factor XII antibody-coated microtiter plates.
◦ Streptavidin-HRP conjugate.
◦ Substrate solution (TMB or equivalent).
◦ Stop solution (e.g., sulfuric acid).
• Supplies:
◦ Disposable pipette tips, microtiter plates, and conical tubes.
◦ Quality control samples (positive and negative control).
5. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Allow reagents and samples to reach room temperature prior to
beginning the assay.
2. Prepare working standards and quality control samples
according to manufacturer instructions.
Assay Procedure:
1. Sample Dilution:
◦ Dilute plasma samples 1:10 with assay buffer unless
otherwise specified by the kit.
2. Plate Preparation:
◦ Add 100 µL of diluted samples, standards, and controls to
the wells of the antibody-coated microtiter plate.
3. Incubation:
◦ Incubate the plate at room temperature for 1 hour to allow
binding of Factor XII to the antibodies.
4. Wash Steps:
◦ Wash each well with 300 µL of wash buffer for 3 cycles to
remove unbound proteins.
5. Detection:
◦ Add 100 µL of streptavidin-HRP conjugate to each well.
◦ Incubate for 30 minutes at room temperature.
◦ Wash thoroughly a further 3 times to remove excess
conjugate.
6. Substrate Addition:
◦ Add 100 µL of TMB substrate solution to each well.
◦ Incubate in the dark at room temperature until the desired
color intensity develops (usually 15-30 minutes).
7. Stopping Reaction:
◦ Add 100 µL of stop solution to each well and mix gently.
8. Reading Results:
◦ Read the absorbance at the specific wavelength (typically
450 nm) using a plate reader.
Quality Control:
• Ensure that both positive and negative controls are within
acceptable ranges.
• If controls are not within specified limits, do not release patient
results until troubleshooting is completed.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results should be recorded in the laboratory information system
(LIS) and reviewed by a technologist.
• Reference intervals must be established based on locally
validated norms.
7. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to the assay kit insert for specific limitations, including
potential interferences from medications or other factors which
may affect results.

REVIEW AND REVISION
• This protocol will be reviewed and revised regularly by the
supervising technologist to incorporate any changes in best
practices or kit modifications.
Staff performing the Factor XII assay should be thoroughly trained
and must ensure proper handling and documentation for accuracy of
results.
