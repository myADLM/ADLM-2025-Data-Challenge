Standard Operating Procedure for Factor XI Inhibitor Evaluation,
Plasma
1. PURPOSE
To describe the analytical phase procedure for the evaluation of
Factor XI inhibitors in plasma. This SOP ensures the accurate and
precise evaluation of Factor XI inhibitors to assist in the diagnosis
and management of patients potentially suffering from bleeding
disorders due to Factor XI inhibitory antibodies.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory personnel to carry
out the following procedure in accordance with this SOP. The
laboratory supervisor or manager must ensure personnel have been
adequately trained and are proficient in these procedures.
2. SPECIMEN
• Preferred/Acceptable:
◦ Platelet-poor plasma (PPP) obtained from a citrated (3.2%
sodium citrate) blood sample.
◦ Centrifuge the sample at 1500 x g for 15 minutes to prepare
PPP.
◦ Aliquot and store PPP at -20°C or lower if not testing
immediately.
• Unacceptable:
◦ Hemolyzed or lipemic samples.
◦ Samples collected in tubes containing anticoagulants other
than 3.2% sodium citrate.
◦ Samples that have been thawed and refrozen.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Coagulation analyzer (e.g., ACL TOP, STA Compact)
• Factor XI-depleted plasma
• Calibration plasma standards
• Control plasma (normal and abnormal levels)
• 0.025 M Calcium Chloride solution
• APTT reagent
• Diluent buffer (e.g., Imidazole buffer, pH 7.35)
• Pipettes and tips
• Vortex mixer
• Water bath or incubator set at 37°C
• Timer
• Laboratory centrifuge
4. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation:
1. Thaw frozen PPP rapidly at 37°C for 5 minutes. Mix gently to
ensure homogenization.
2. Label aliquots with patient identification and assay
identification.
B. Assay Setup:
1. Calibrate the coagulation analyzer using calibrated plasma
standards.
2. Prepare the Factor XI-deficient plasma and ensure it is stored
as per manufacturer’s guidelines.
3. Reconstitute or prepare all necessary reagents as per
manufacturer’s instructions, and bring them to room
temperature before use.
C. Performing the Assay:
1. Mix 100 µL of patient plasma with 100 µL of Factor XI-depleted
plasma.
2. Incubate the mixture at 37°C for 2 minutes.
3. Add 100 µL of APTT reagent to the mixture and vortex briefly.
4. Incubate at 37°C for the required activation time (typically 5
minutes).
5. Add 100 µL of pre-warmed 0.025 M Calcium Chloride solution
to start the reaction.
6. Measure the clotting time using the coagulation analyzer.
7. Record the clotting time and compare it against reference
intervals established by the laboratory.
D. Calculation and Interpretation
1. Evaluate the clotting time against the control and normal
reference ranges.
2. If the patient’s clotting time is significantly prolonged in
comparison to the control and normal ranges, a Bethesda
assay or Nijmegen modification may be performed to quantify
the inhibitor titer.
3. Interpret and report results appropriately, indicating the
presence or absence of Factor XI inhibitor and its titer if
applicable.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Run control plasmas with each batch of patient samples to
ensure the integrity and accuracy of the assay.
2. Quality control materials should include normal and high/low
range controls, and results must fall within the established
acceptable range.
3. If control results are out of range, troubleshoot the issue before
reporting any patient results.
4. Document all QC results appropriately.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
2. Ensure all results are reviewed and verified by a qualified
technologist.
3. Any critical results should be communicated immediately to the
attending physician or appropriate healthcare provider following
laboratory policies.
7. REFERENCES
1. Manufacturer instructions for the coagulation analyzer and all
reagents.
2. Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines for
coagulation testing.
3. Peer-reviewed literature on Factor XI Inhibitor evaluation.
8. SAFETY
1. Follow all laboratory safety guidelines for handling blood
specimens and reagents.
2. Use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) including
lab coat, gloves, and eye protection.
9. DOCUMENTATION
1. Record all assays, controls, and calibrations, including results
and any deviations or corrective actions taken.
2. Maintain thorough records in accordance with laboratory quality
management systems.
By following this SOP, the laboratory aims to ensure reliable and
consistent evaluation of Factor XI inhibitors in plasma, contributing to
accurate diagnosis and management of patients with suspected
bleeder disorders related to Factor XI inhibitors.
