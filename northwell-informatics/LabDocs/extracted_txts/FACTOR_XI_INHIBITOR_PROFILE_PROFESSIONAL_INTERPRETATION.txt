Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
1. TITLE:
FACTOR XI INHIBITOR PROFILE, PROFESSIONAL
INTERPRETATION
2. PURPOSE:
To outline the procedures for the analysis and interpretation of the
Factor XI Inhibitor Profile in plasma samples, ensuring accurate and
reliable results for clinical diagnosis and management.
3. RESPONSIBILITY:
Designated laboratory staff performing the analysis are responsible
for this process. Supervisors will ensure adherence to the protocol
and address any deviations or issues.
4. SPECIMENS:
Acceptable:
• Citrated plasma (3.2% sodium citrate) with a minimum volume of
2.0 mL.
• Specimens should be centrifuged promptly to separate plasma
and stored at -20°C or lower until analysis.
Unacceptable:
• Hemolyzed or lipemic samples.
• Samples not processed and frozen within 4 hours of collection.
• Specimens stored at room temperature or thawed more than
once.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES:
• Coagulation analyzer capable of performing Factor XI activity
assays.
• Factor XI specific reagents from an approved manufacturer.
• Positive and negative control plasmas.
• Standard calibration materials.
• Appropriate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) for personnel.
6. PROCEDURE:
A) Preparation:
1. Safety Assessment: Ensure all safety protocols are in place,
and proper PPE is worn.
2. Reagent Preparation: Prepare reagents as per manufacturer’s
instructions, ensuring all are within their expiration dates.
3. Equipment Calibration: Calibrate the coagulation analyzer
using standard calibration materials. Document calibration in
the logbook.
B) Specimen Handling:
1. Thaw the frozen plasma samples at 37°C in a water bath.
2. Mix gently and aliquot as needed.
3. Centrifuge specimens at 2000 x g for 10 minutes at room
temperature if required.
C) Assay Procedure:
1. Analysis:
◦ Load controls, calibrators, and patient samples onto the
coagulation analyzer.
◦ Perform a Factor XI activity assay following the
manufacturer's protocol.
◦ Ensure each assay run includes a set of positive and
negative controls.
◦ Records all results, including any deviations or anomalies.
2. Recording and Verification:
◦ Document results in the appropriate log, ensuring
traceability.
◦ Verify control results are within the acceptable range before
reporting patient results.
◦ In case of control failure, troubleshoot, resolve, and re-run
controls and patient samples.
D) Professional Interpretation:
1. Review Raw Data:
◦ Check for consistency and accuracy in assay results.
◦ Cross-reference with control values and historical data.
2. Analyzing Inhibitor Presence:
◦ Calculate the Bethesda units (BU) if an inhibitor is
suspected.
◦ Comparison with reference ranges.
◦ Consult literature and guidelines for interpretation criteria.
3. Reporting Results:
◦ Generate a report that includes the activity level, any
inhibitor titers, and interpretative comments.
◦ Mention if further testing or clinical correlation is advised.
◦ Ensure that the report is reviewed and signed off by a
qualified professional.
7. QUALITY CONTROL:
• Run quality control samples with each batch of tests.
• Maintain records of control results, reagents lot numbers, and
calibrations.
• Participate in external quality assurance programs if available.
8. REPORTING RESULTS:
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• All results must be reviewed and verified by a qualified
technologist or supervisor.
• Document deviation or abnormalities, and interpret results in
context with patient history and previous results.
9. REFERENCE INTERVALS:
• Factor XI Activity: Normal range 70-150%.
• Inhibitor Titer: Negative <0.6 BU, Equivocal 0.6-1 BU, Positive >1
BU.
10. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
• Ensure specimens are free from contamination.
• Sample integrity is crucial; inappropriate storage can lead to
inaccurate results.
• High bilirubin, hemolysis, or lipemia can interfere with results.
11. REFERENCES:
• Manufacturer's insert for Factor XI assay reagents.
• Current literature on Factor XI inhibitors and professional
guidelines.
• CLIA regulations and local institutional protocols.
This SOP is designed to ensure consistency and accuracy in the
analytical phase of the Factor XI Inhibitor Profile test. Staff must
familiarize themselves with the procedure and adhere to it strictly to
maintain the quality of laboratory results.
