Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Factor XI Inhibitor
Profile, Technical Interpretation
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for the analytical phase of generating Factor
XI Inhibitor Profile results with technical interpretation to ensure
accurate and reliable test outcomes.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
Qualified laboratory personnel are responsible for performing the
Factor XI Inhibitor Profile assay, analyzing the data, and documenting
the results in accordance with this SOP.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
3.1 Specimen Type:
• Citrated plasma (Blue-top sodium citrate tube).
• Preferred volume: 3-5 mL of platelet-poor plasma.
• Ensure thorough mixing of blood with anticoagulant.
3.2 Specimen Stability:
• Immediately separate plasma by centrifugation at 1500 x g for 15
minutes at 18-24°C.
• Aliquot plasma into appropriately labeled tubes and freeze at
-70°C if not analyzed immediately; stable for up to 6 months.
• Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
3.3 Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric specimens.
• Specimens not properly mixed with anticoagulant.
• Specimens not processed within recommended time frame or
improperly stored.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
4.1 Equipment:
• Coagulation analyzer capable of measuring Factor XI activity and
inhibitor titers.
• Centrifuge.
• Freezer (-70°C).
4.2 Reagents:
• Factor XI assay reagent kit (Refer to specific product inserts for
contents and storage conditions).
• Normal and deficient plasma controls.
• Reference plasma (standard calibrator).
4.3 Supplies:
• Citrated Collection Tubes (Blue-top).
• Aliquot tubes.
• Pipettes and tips.
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE).
5. QUALITY CONTROL
• Verify the calibration and functioning of the coagulation analyzer
as per manufacturer’s guidelines.
• Run normal and deficient plasma controls daily before patient
sample testing.
• Record and monitor control results to ensure they fall within the
established range.
6. PROCEDURE
6.1 Pre-Analytical Phase:
• Verify the patient information and specimen labeling.
• Ensure specimens meet the acceptance criteria before
proceeding with analysis.
6.2 Analytical Phase:
Step 1: Preparation
• Thaw frozen plasma samples rapidly at 37°C and gently mix; do
not vortex.
• Prepare the assay reagents according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
Step 2: Factor XI Activity Assay
• Dilute the patient plasma and controls as required.
• Load the plasma samples, normal and deficient controls, and
reference plasma into the coagulation analyzer.
• Program the coagulation analyzer to perform Factor XI activity
assay.
• Record the Factor XI activity levels.
Step 3: Inhibitor Assay (Bethesda Assay)
• Perform serial dilutions of patient plasma with normal plasma.
• Incubate the mixture at 37°C for the recommended duration.
• Measure the residual Factor XI activity in each dilution using the
coagulation analyzer.
• Calculate the inhibitor titer (Bethesda units) based on the residual
Factor XI activity.
6.3 Interpretation of Results:
• Normal Range: Factor XI activity levels should be between
70-150%.
• Inhibitor Presence: Factor XI inhibitor titers ≥0.5 Bethesda units
are considered positive.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
7.1 Technical Interpretation:
• Report the Factor XI activity level as a percentage of normal.
• Report inhibitor titers in Bethesda units (BU).
• Include a technical interpretation summarizing the significance of
the findings, noting any abnormal results and their potential
clinical implications.
7.2 Documentation:
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS) or
appropriate reporting format.
• Include the date, time, and technologist's initials performing the
test and obtaining the results.
• Highlight critical values or findings that require immediate clinical
attention and follow the protocol for reporting critical results.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Ensure all assays are conducted under optimal conditions;
deviations may affect assay performance and result accuracy.
• Potential interferences from hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric plasma
samples.
