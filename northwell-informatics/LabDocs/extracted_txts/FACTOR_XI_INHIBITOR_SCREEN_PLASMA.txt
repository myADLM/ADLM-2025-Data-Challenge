Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase Protocol for Generating Results for Factor XI
Inhibitor Screen, Plasma
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedure
for the analytical phase of generating results for Factor XI
Inhibitor Screen from plasma samples. This protocol ensures
accuracy, reliability, and reproducibility of test results, adhering
to CLIA regulations.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS Acceptable Specimen Type:
• Citrated plasma obtained by collecting venous blood into a 3.2%
sodium citrate tube.
Specimen Handling:
• Centrifuge within 30 minutes of collection to obtain platelet-poor
plasma.
• Aliquot plasma into labeled tubes.
• Freeze plasma at -20°C or preferably -80°C promptly.
• Transport frozen plasma samples to the laboratory on dry ice.
Unacceptable Specimen Handling:
• Plasma samples not centrifuged promptly.
• Samples displaying hemolysis, icterus, or lipemia.
• Samples stored above -20°C or refrozen multiple times.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Factor XI deficient plasma.
• Normal pooled plasma (NPP).
• Calcium chloride solution (0.025 M).
• Phospholipid reagents.
• APTT reagents and activators.
• Incubation equipment.
• Coagulation analyzer capable of performing clot-based assays
such as APTT.
• Pipettes and tips.
• Timer.
• Vortex mixer.
• Dry ice (for transport).
1. REAGENT STORAGE AND PREPARATION
• Store Factor XI deficient plasma, NPP, and phospholipid reagents
as required by the manufacturer, typically at -20°C or lower.
• Thaw frozen reagents at 37°C in a water bath immediately prior to
use.
• Prepare working solutions following manufacturer’s guidelines
and record all lot numbers and expiration dates.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform quality control using normal pooled plasma and Factor XI
deficient plasma.
• Run both internal and external QC materials for each batch of
tests.
• Confirm that control values are within the specified range before
proceeding with sample analysis.
• Document all QC results, including any corrective actions taken.
1. ANALYTICAL PROCEDURE A. Pre-Analysis:
2. Thaw plasma samples at 37°C in a water bath ensuring
complete liquefaction.
3. Mix the plasma samples gently using a vortex mixer.
B. Analysis:
1. Combine the patient's plasma sample with an equal volume of
Factor XI deficient plasma.
2. Incubate the mixture at 37°C for 5 minutes.
3. Add the phospholipid reagent and incubate for 1-2 minutes.
4. Add calcium chloride solution to initiate clotting.
5. Measure the APTT using the coagulation analyzer.
C. Interpretation:
1. Compare the APTT of the patient-deficient plasma mixture to
normal pooled plasma.
2. A prolongation of APTT suggests the presence of a Factor XI
inhibitor.
3. Confirm results with appropriate controls.
D. Troubleshooting:
1. If QC results fall outside acceptable limits, identify and correct
the source of error or perform recalibration.
2. Repeat test if patient results are outside expected ranges or
show inconclusive results.
3. REPORTING AND DOCUMENTATION
• Document results in the laboratory information system (LIS).
• Report critical values promptly following lab protocol.
• Enter complete batch information including sample identification,
control results, and technologist initials.

1. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS
• Wear personal protective equipment (PPE) including lab coat,
gloves, and eye protection.
• Handle all biological specimens following standard precautions.
• Dispose of biohazard waste appropriately.
