STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP) - FACTOR XI,
PLASMA ANALYSIS
1. PURPOSE
To provide a detailed procedure for the analysis of Factor XI (FXI)
activity in plasma to ensure accurate and reliable results.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all personnel involved in the analysis of Factor XI
in the Hematology/Coagulation Laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• It is the responsibility of the laboratory technologist to perform and
document the analysis of Factor XI activity in plasma.
• The supervisor is responsible for ensuring that the technologists
are properly trained on this SOP and for reviewing results for
quality control.
4. MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT
• Platelet-poor plasma (PPP) samples
• Normal and abnormal control plasmas
• Factor XI-deficient plasma
• Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT) reagent
• Calcium chloride (0.025M)
• Incubation bath (37°C water bath or dry heating block)
• Coagulometer or equivalent clot detection device
• Disposable plastic pipettes
• Timer
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
5. SPECIMEN
5.1 Collection:
• Collect blood by venipuncture into a 3.2% sodium citrate tube.
• The ratio of blood to anticoagulant must be 9:1.
• Mix immediately by gentle inversion 4-5 times to ensure proper
mixing.
5.2 Processing:
• Centrifuge the sample at 1500 x g for 15 minutes to obtain
platelet-poor plasma (PPP).
• Aliquot the plasma into labeled tubes and freeze immediately at
-70°C if testing is not performed within 4 hours.
5.3 Storage:
• Specimens stored at -70°C are stable for up to 6 months.
• Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform quality control at the beginning of each shift or before
running patient samples by analyzing normal and abnormal
control plasmas.
• Results must fall within the established control limits before
proceeding with patient samples.
• Document all QC results according to site-specific guidelines.
7. PROCEDURE
7.1 Preparation:
1. Bring all required reagents and controls to room temperature.
2. Pre-warm the aPTT reagent and calcium chloride (0.025M) in a
37°C water bath or dry heating block.
3. Thaw patient samples rapidly in a 37°C water bath.
7.2 Testing:
1. Pipette 50 μL of patient plasma or control plasma into a test
cuvette.
2. Add 50 μL of Factor XI-deficient plasma to the test cuvette and
mix gently.
3. Incubate the mixture for 3 minutes at 37°C.
4. Add 50 μL of pre-warmed aPTT reagent to the cuvette, incubate
for an additional 5 minutes at 37°C.
5. Add 50 μL of pre-warmed calcium chloride (0.025M) to the
cuvette to initiate the clotting reaction.
6. Start the timer and record the clotting time using the
coagulometer or equivalent clot detection device.
7. Repeat the procedure for each patient sample and control.
8. CALCULATION AND INTERPRETATION
• Calculate the Factor XI activity using the following formula: [
\text{Factor XI Activity} (%) = \frac{\text{Patient clotting time
(seconds)}}{\text{Control clotting time (seconds)}} \times 100 ]
9. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results must be entered into the laboratory information system
(LIS) and reviewed by the technologist.
• Reference range for Factor XI activity: 70% - 150%.
10. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolysis, lipemia, and icterus can interfere with clot detection
and lead to erroneous results.
• Inaccurate results may occur if the plasma sample is not properly
prepared or stored.
11. REFERENCES
• Relevant procedural manuals and package inserts (e.g., aPTT
reagent insert, Factor XI-deficient plasma insert).
• Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines
• Manufacturer instructions and guidelines for coagulometer or
equivalent clot detection device.
12. DOCUMENT CONTROL
• Review and update this SOP annually or whenever a procedural
change occurs.
• Document all reviews and updates appropriately.
13. TRAINING
• All personnel performing this test must be trained and deemed
competent.
• Training records must be maintained and reviewed periodically.
By following this standard operating procedure, the laboratory
ensures consistent, accurate, and reliable analysis of Factor XI
activity in plasma samples.
