Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Title: Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for FACTOR X INHIBITOR EVALUATION,
PLASMA
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedures for the accurate
and consistent analytical evaluation of Factor X inhibitor in plasma.
This ensures reliable and reproducible results that can be used for
diagnostic and therapeutic monitoring purposes.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory staff to adhere to
this protocol. Any deviations or issues observed during the procedure
must be reported to the supervisor immediately.
1. DEFINITION
Factor X Inhibitor Evaluation: This is a test performed on plasma to
measure the presence and concentration of inhibitors against Factor
X. These inhibitors can interfere with the clotting process and this
evaluation is crucial for patients with bleeding disorders.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND HANDLING
• Specimen Type: Plasma.
• Collection: Blood should be collected into sodium citrate
anticoagulant tubes (light blue top).
• Volume: Collect a minimum of 2 ml of blood.
• Processing:
◦ Within 1 hour of collection, centrifuge the blood sample at
1500g for 15 minutes at 4°C to separate the plasma.
◦ Transfer the plasma to a sterile, labeled cryovial.
◦ Store plasma at -20°C if analysis is not immediate.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic or icteric samples.
• Samples received in non-citrate tubes.
• Samples stored at improper temperatures.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Coagulation analyzer (e.g., STA-R Evolution, ACL TOP)
• Reagents:
◦ Factor X-deficient plasma
◦ Normal pooled plasma (NPP)
◦ APTT reagent
◦ Calcium chloride (0.025M)
◦ Control plasmas (low, normal, and high)
• Pipettes and tips
• Disposable cuvettes
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
Storage Conditions:
• Store all reagents and control materials at 2-8°C as per
manufacturer’s instructions.
• Refer to reagent and control material insert for stability and
expiration dates.
1. CALIBRATION AND QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform calibration using NPP as instructed by the analyzer
manual.
• Run quality control samples (low, normal, and high) before
performing patient testing.
• Verify that QC results are within the acceptable range before
proceeding with patient samples.
• Document all QC results and corrective actions taken if QC fails.
1. ANALYTICAL PROCEDURE
Preparation
• Allow reagents and samples to come to room temperature before
testing.
• Thaw frozen plasma samples rapidly in a 37°C water bath and
gently mix.
Testing
• Following the instrument manual, load the necessary reagents,
controls, and patient samples to the coagulation analyzer.
• Select the Factor X Inhibitor assay from the test menu.
• Pipette 50 µL of patient plasma into a disposable cuvette.
• Add 50 µL of Factor X-deficient plasma.
• Add 50 µL of APTT reagent and incubate as per the instrument
protocol.
• Add 50 µL of calcium chloride solution to initiate the reaction.
• Monitor the clotting time reading from the coagulation analyzer.
Calculations
• Compare the patient’s clotting time against the normal control
reference range provided by the manufacturer.
• Calculate the inhibitor titer using the formula provided in the
reagent package insert.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Document the results in the laboratory information system (LIS).
• Review all patient results, and verify against QC results and
reference ranges.
• Report critical values to the ordering physician immediately as per
laboratory policy.
• If a test result is inconclusive or if there are any discrepancies,
take appropriate measures such as repeating the test or running
additional controls.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• The procedure is sensitive to sample quality. Hemolyzed or
lipemic samples can interfere with results.
• The presence of other coagulation inhibitors in the patient’s
plasma can affect the accuracy of this assay.
• Ensure to handle all reagents and controls as per the
manufacturer's recommendations to avoid potential variability in
results.

1. REVIEW AND APPROVAL
This SOP shall be reviewed annually or whenever there is a change
in protocol, reagents, or equipment. All changes must be approved by
the laboratory director or designee.
