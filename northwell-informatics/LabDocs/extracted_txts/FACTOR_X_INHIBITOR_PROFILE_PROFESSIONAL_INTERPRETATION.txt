Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for FACTOR X INHIBITOR
PROFILE, PROFESSIONAL INTERPRETATION
1. PURPOSE
This protocol provides guidelines for the analytical phase of
generating results for Factor X Inhibitor Profile, ensuring accurate,
precise, and reliable professional interpretation.
Responsibility: It is the responsibility of designated laboratory
personnel to perform and document the analytical procedures
accurately as per this SOP.
1. DEFINITIONS
Factor X Inhibitor Profile: A comprehensive assessment of factor X
activity levels and the presence of inhibitors that may affect
coagulation.
Professional Interpretation: Evaluation and interpretation of test
results by a qualified professional to provide a clinical insight into the
patient's haemostatic status.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Equipment and Reagents:
• Hemostasis analyzer (e.g., ACL TOP, Sysmex CA)
• Factor X deficient plasma
• Normal control plasma
• Specific Factor X inhibitor neutralization reagent (if applicable)
• Reagent kits for Factor X assay (specific to analyzer model)
• Calibrators and quality control materials
• Appropriate pipettes, tips, and other ancillary supplies
B. Sample Preparation:
• Ensure that the specimen (citrated plasma) meets pre-analytic
criteria and has been collected properly.
• Verify patient identification and specimen details before
proceeding.
• Centrifuge the plasma samples if not already done.
C. Quality Control:
• Perform quality control checks at the beginning of each testing
shift using normal and abnormal control plasmas.
• Document QC results, and ensure they fall within predetermined
acceptable ranges before proceeding with patient testing.
D. Assay Procedure:
1. Preparation:
• Allow reagents and samples to reach room temperature before
use.
• Mix all reagents as per the manufacturer’s instructions.
1. Standard Assay Procedure:
• Measure 100 μL of Factor X deficient plasma and 100 μL of
patient plasma into a sample cup.
• Add 50 μL of reagent (e.g., PT reagent, depending on instrument
requirements).
• Follow the instrument's protocols to measure Factor X activity.
• Run each patient sample duplicate for accuracy.
1. Inhibitor Detection Procedure:
• Using the same volumes and procedures, mix 100 μL of normal
pooled plasma with 100 μL of patient plasma.
• Add the appropriate reagents and perform the Factor X activity
assay as per the standard procedure.
• Interpret the results in conjunction with the Factor X activity.
1. Data Management:
• Ensure the analyzer’s software stores and records all results
correctly.
• Manually log the results in the laboratory information system if
necessary.
• Document any deviation from standard procedure or instrument
alerts.
F. Troubleshooting:
• If QC results are out of range, do not proceed with patient testing;
resolve the issue as per manufacturer's recommendations.
• Verify sample and reagent volumes if results seem inconsistent.
• Contact the technical support team if mechanical problems with
the analyzer are noted.
G. Professional Interpretation:
• Factor X activity below reference interval (50-150% of normal)
should be interpreted in conjunction with clinical history and
inhibitor assay results.
• If there is evidence of an inhibitor (inhibitor assay positive), the
degree of inhibition is quantified and reported by the professional
interpreter.
• Document the interpretation clearly and concisely in the patient's
medical record.
1. REPORTING RESULTS:
• All test results are to be reviewed and verified by a qualified
technologist.
• Results are to be reported in a timely manner to healthcare
providers.
• If critical values or significant findings are identified, promptly
notify the clinician in accordance with the laboratory’s critical
results policy.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS:
• Factor X Activity: 50-150% of normal
• Interpretation should include the clinical significance of activity
levels and any inhibitors present.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
• Hemolyzed or lipemic samples may lead to inaccurate results.
• Inadequate mixing of reagents or improper sample handling can
affect the assay's accuracy.
• Refer to the manufacturer's reagent insert for specific limitations
related to the reagent kits used.
1. REFERENCES:
• Manufacturer’s guidelines for the hemostasis analyzer and
reagent kits.
• Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines.
• Recent peer-reviewed literature on Factor X and coagulation
inhibitors.
1. DOCUMENT CONTROL:
• This SOP shall be reviewed annually or when significant changes
occur.
• Document any revisions and note the date of review.
By adhering to this SOP, the analytical phase of generating results for
the Factor X Inhibitor Profile is standardized, ensuring reliable and
clinically actionable results through professional interpretation.
