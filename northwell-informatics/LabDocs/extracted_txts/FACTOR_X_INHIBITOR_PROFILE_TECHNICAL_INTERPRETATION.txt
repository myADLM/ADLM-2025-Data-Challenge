FACTOR X INHIBITOR PROFILE, TECHNICAL INTERPRETATION
SOP
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to provide standardized instructions
for the analytical phase of generating results for Factor X Inhibitor
Profile and performing the technical interpretation of results. This
ensures accuracy, consistency, and reliability in the testing and
reporting of Factor X Inhibitor Profile.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to the laboratory personnel responsible for
the analytical testing and technical interpretation of Factor X Inhibitor
Profile in coagulation studies.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the laboratory technologists to perform the
analytical testing according to this SOP, and to document and report
results in accordance with laboratory policies. The supervising
technologist ensures compliance with the procedure and oversees
any necessary corrective actions.
4. DEFINITION
Factor X Inhibitor Profile is a laboratory test performed to identify and
quantify the presence of inhibitors against Factor X, an essential
protein in the blood coagulation pathway.
5. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Coagulation analyzer (e.g., automated coagulation instrument)
• Factor X deficient plasma
• Standard human plasma (normal control)
• Specific Factor X inhibitor control plasma (positive control)
• Calcium chloride solution (0.025 mol/L)
• Owren's Veronal Buffer or Coagulation Buffer
• Buffer saline solution
• Calibration and quality control material
• Pipettes (variable volume)
• Test tubes (glass or appropriate plastic for coagulation studies)
• Reagent kits and control plasmas with established lot number and
expiration dates
6. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Type: Citrated plasma
• Volume: Minimum of 2 mL plasma
• Collection: Blood should be collected in a 3.2% sodium citrate
anticoagulant tube. The blood-to-anticoagulant ratio must be
maintained at 9:1.
• Processing: Plasma should be separated by centrifugation at
1500 x g for 15 minutes within 1 hour of collection. Avoid
hemolysis.
• Storage: At 2-8°C for up to 4 hours or frozen at -70°C if delayed
analysis is expected. Avoid multiple freeze-thaw cycles.
7. PROCEDURE
A. Calibration and Quality Control
1. Calibrate the coagulation analyzer according to manufacturer
instructions.
2. Run quality control samples (normal and abnormal controls) at
the beginning of each shift, after maintenance, and whenever a
new reagent lot is opened.
3. Verify that control results fall within the established acceptable
range before patient sample analysis. Document the control
data.
B. Analytical Procedure
1. Prepare reagent kits according to the manufacturer's
guidelines.
2. Pipette the appropriate volume of Factor X deficient plasma into
the test cuvette.
3. Add an equal volume of patient plasma to the cuvette.
4. Pipette an equal volume of buffer saline to provide a suitable
final test volume.
5. Incubate the mixture at 37°C for 2 minutes.
6. Add an aliquot of calcium chloride solution to initiate clotting.
7. Measure the clotting time using the coagulation analyzer.
8. Repeat steps 2-7 with standard human plasma and specific
Factor X inhibitor control plasma for calibration and
comparison.
9. Record all clotting times.
8. ANALYTICAL INTERPRETATION
1. Calculate the patient’s Factor X activity based on the clotting
time relative to the standard curve established with the
standard human plasma.
2. Analyze for the presence of inhibitors by mixing studies with
normal plasma. If the prolonged clotting time is corrected by
adding normal plasma, it indicates a deficiency. If not corrected,
it suggests the presence of inhibitors.
3. Calculate the inhibitor titer (Bethesda units) using the specific
control plasma for Factor X inhibitor.
4. Compare the patient’s results to the reference range and
normal controls.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Document results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
2. Ensure that all critical values are flagged and promptly
communicated to the ordering physician.
3. Include any pertinent comments or interpretative statements
based on the presence of inhibitors, inhibitor titer, and patient
history.
◦ Example Comment: "Presence of Factor X inhibitors
suspected with a titer of XX Bethesda units. Suggest further
evaluation."
10. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Perform proficiency testing as scheduled.
2. Maintain thorough documentation of all calibrations, controls,
and quality checks.
3. Review all logged results and corrective actions periodically to
ensure ongoing accuracy and precision of the method.
11. CORRECTIVE ACTION
If quality control results are out of acceptable range:
1. Review procedures and reagent preparation for potential errors.
2. Recalibrate the instrument and rerun controls.
3. If issues persist, consult with the supervising technologist and/
or manufacturer for technical support and troubleshooting.
