FACTOR X INHIBITOR SCREEN, PLASMA
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized and accurate procedure for performing
Factor X Inhibitor Screen on plasma specimens, ensuring consistent
results and reliable outcomes.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of trained laboratory personnel to perform and
document the Factor X Inhibitor Screen according to this protocol. All
testing and results must be reviewed and verified by a qualified
technologist.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred Specimen:
• 3.2% Citrate (Light Blue Top) tube.
• Collect at least 2.7 mL of whole blood for a standard tube.
Specimen Handling:
• The specimen must be handled with care to prevent activation of
clotting factors.
• After collection, centrifuge the specimen at 2000-2500 x g for 15
minutes to separate plasma.
• Carefully transfer the plasma to a plastic transport tube.
• Specimens should be kept at room temperature if analysis is
performed within 4 hours. If a delay in testing is anticipated,
freeze the plasma aliquots at -70°C.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
• Specimens collected in anticoagulants other than 3.2% citrate.
• Partially filled or overfilled tubes.
• Clotted specimens.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Hemostasis analyzer compatible with Factor X inhibitor assay.
• Quality control plasma (normal and known Factor X inhibitor
positive controls).
• Factor X deficient plasma.
• Calcium chloride solution.
• Appropriate buffers and substrates for the assay.
Reagent Storage:
• Store all reagents as per manufacturer’s instructions, usually at
2-8°C.
• Reconstitute reagents according to the instructions and use them
within the stability period provided.
1. PROCEDURE
2. Pre-Analytical Phase: a. Verify patient information and test
requisition. b. Confirm that specimen meets acceptance criteria.
c. Label all tubes and documents accurately.
3. Analytical Phase: a. Prepare the analyzer according to the
instrument-specific SOP. b. Prepare reagents and calibrators if
required. c. Program the analyzer for Factor X Inhibitor Screen
testing. d. Pre-warm reagents and plasma to 37°C. e. Pipette a
precise volume of patient plasma into the test cuvette. f. Add
reagent containing Factor X deficient plasma and activators. g.
Initiate the reaction by adding a calcium chloride solution. h.
Monitor the assay for completion and generate clotting time
results.
4. Quality Control: a. Run quality control materials with each batch
of patient samples. b. Compare QC results against expected
ranges. If QC results are outside acceptable limits, troubleshoot
and resolve issues before proceeding with patient sample
analysis. c. Document all QC activities, including corrective
actions if required.
5. Post-Analytical Phase: a. Review and verify the results
generated by the analyzer for Factor X Inhibitor Screen. b.
Record the results in the laboratory information system (LIS). c.
If an inhibitor is detected (prolonged clotting time), further
confirm with additional testing if required. d. Report critical
results immediately to the responsible physician or healthcare
provider per laboratory policy.
6. Reporting Results:
◦ Report results according to site-specific guidelines.
◦ Include comments on any limitations or possible
interferences observed during the analysis.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Ensure the use of certified quality control materials for both
normal and abnormal ranges.
• Perform internal quality control checks with every run of patient
samples.
• Use external quality control or proficiency testing programs
periodically to validate the accuracy of results.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Normal clotting times should be established based on laboratory-
specific validation studies and reagent manufacturer guidelines.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Identify any potential limitations or interferences that might affect test
results, such as:
• Presence of heparin or other anticoagulants in the sample.
• Elevated levels of bilirubin, hemolysis, or lipemia.
• Incomplete anticoagulation of plasma samples.

This protocol is subject to review and updates as per laboratory
policy changes or advancements in the methodology. All laboratory
staff must be trained and competent in executing this protocol.
