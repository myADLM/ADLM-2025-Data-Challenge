FACTOR X, PLASMA: ANALYTICAL PHASE PROTOCOL
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is to
provide a standardized method for the analysis and reporting of
Factor X activity levels in plasma samples. This ensures accuracy,
consistency, and reliability in the results reported by the laboratory.
1. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all personnel performing Factor X activity assays
in the laboratory. It covers the analytical phase, including the
preparation of reagents, calibration of equipment, analysis of
samples, and quality control procedures.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all qualified laboratory personnel to follow
this SOP. Supervisors are responsible for ensuring adherence to the
procedures, maintaining proper documentation, and addressing any
issues that may arise during the analytical process.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred Specimen:
• Citrated plasma collected in 3.2% sodium citrate tubes.
• Properly filled tubes to ensure a correct blood-to-anticoagulant
ratio (9 parts blood: 1 part citrate).
• Samples must be mixed gently by inversion immediately following
collection.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, clotted, or improperly filled tubes.
• Specimens without proper labeling or without collection date and
time.
• Specimens collected in anticoagulants other than 3.2% sodium
citrate.
1. REAGENTS AND EQUIPMENT
Reagents:
• Factor X deficient plasma (commercially available).
• Factor X standard/calibrator.
• Thromboplastin reagent (contains calcium and phospholipids).
Equipment:
• Coagulation analyzer capable of performing Factor X activity
assays.
• Calibrated pipettes.
• Precision water baths or heating blocks (set to 37°C).
• Centrifuge for plasma preparation.
1. PROCEDURE
2. Preparation of Reagents:
◦ Reconstitute lyophilized reagents with distilled water as per
manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Prepare calibrators and quality control materials as
instructed.
3. Calibration of Equipment:
◦ Ensure the coagulation analyzer is calibrated using Factor X
standards.
◦ Perform calibration prior to running patient samples and at
intervals recommended by the manufacturer.
4. Sample Preparation:
◦ Centrifuge citrated blood samples at 1500 g for 15 minutes
at room temperature to obtain platelet-poor plasma (PPP).
◦ Aliquot the plasma into labeled tubes for analysis and
storage.
◦ If immediate analysis is not possible, store plasma at -20°C
or below.
5. Assay Procedure:
◦ Bring all reagents and samples to room temperature before
use.
◦ Load Factor X deficient plasma, prepared reagents,
calibrators, quality control materials, and patient plasma
samples into the coagulation analyzer as per manufacturer’s
instructions.
◦ Perform the Factor X assay as per analyzer protocol.
◦ The analyzer will add the thromboplastin reagent to each
sample, initiating the clotting process and measuring the
time it takes for a clot to form.
6. Quality Control:
◦ Run quality control samples (both high and low controls)
with each batch of patient samples.
◦ Ensure control results are within an established acceptable
range before reporting patient results.
7. Analytical Considerations:
◦ Verify that all results, including those of quality controls and
calibrators, are within specified ranges.
◦ Repeat the assay if control results fall outside acceptable
ranges or if there is any inconsistency.
◦ Document any corrective actions taken if control samples
fail.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Review and validate all results generated by the coagulation
analyzer.
• Enter validated results into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
• Ensure that results flagged as critical are promptly communicated
to the responsible clinical personnel according to the lab's critical
results notification policy.
1. QUALITY ASSURANCE AND DOCUMENTATION
• Maintain detailed records of reagent preparation, equipment
calibration, quality control, and sample analysis.
• Review and store all records as specified in the laboratory's
documentation policy.
• Participate in proficiency testing and inter-laboratory comparisons
to ensure ongoing accuracy and reliability.
