Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase of Generating Results for False Ragweed, IgE
(RAST), Serum
1. PURPOSE
This procedure outlines the steps for the analytical phase of
generating results for False Ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia) IgE
(RAST), Serum. The objective is to ensure the accurate and
reproducible measurement of specific IgE antibodies to False
Ragweed in patient serum samples.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of designated technical staff to perform the
analysis and ensure the accuracy and precision of the test results.
1. DEFINITION
False Ragweed, IgE (RAST), Serum is a laboratory test used to
identify specific IgE antibodies to False Ragweed in the serum of
individuals suspected of having an allergic response to this allergen.
1. PROCEDURE
3.1 Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies
- Immunoassay analyzer (e.g., Phadia ImmunoCAP, Siemens Immulite)
- Standard laboratory centrifuge
- Micropipettes and tips
- False Ragweed-specific IgE RAST reagent kit
- Quality control samples (positive and negative controls)
- Calibrators for IgE measurement
- Sample tubes
- Sample racks
- Disposable gloves
- Laboratory coat
- Timer
3.2 Preparation
1. Ensure that all equipment is calibrated and maintained as per manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Thaw reagents, controls, and calibrators according to the manufacturer's instructions.
3. Set the immunoassay analyzer to the appropriate assay protocol for False Ragweed-specific IgE, ensuring all parameters match the reagent kit requirements.
3.3 Sample Processing
1. Ensure that serum samples are properly identified and have been accessioned.
2. Centrifuge the serum samples at 1500-2000 x g for 10 minutes to remove any particulate matter.
3. Aliquot the clear serum into appropriately labeled microtubes if necessary, avoiding hemolyzed or lipemic samples.
4. Maintain serum samples at 2-8°C until ready for analysis. If not analyzed within 24 hours, store at -20°C or lower.
3.4 Running the Test
1. Load the calibrators, controls, and serum samples onto the sample racks per the analyzer's instructions.
2. Program the immunoassay analyzer with the correct test protocol for False Ragweed-specific IgE.
3. Load reagents and ensure sufficient volumes are available for the entire run.
4. Initiate the assay run following the specific immunoassay analyzer’s instructions for operation.
5. Monitor the assay progression and address any instrument alerts promptly.
3.5 Quality Control
1. Include both positive and negative controls with each assay run to ensure the proper performance of the assay.
2. Review the control results for each run. The assay is considered valid if the control results fall within the specified ranges.
3. In case of control failure, do not report patient results; troubleshoot the issue, and repeat the assay.
3.6 Result Interpretation and Reporting
1. The analyzer will automatically calculate the IgE concentration for each serum sample based on the standard curve generated by the calibrators.
2. Review the results for any warning or error flags indicating issues during analysis.
3. Verify results of patient samples against the appropriate controls to ensure validity.
4. Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS) accurately.
5. For samples where the IgE level for False Ragweed falls outside the calibration range, assign the result as “< Minimum Detection Limit” or “> Maximum Detection Limit,” as appropriate.
3.7 Result Verification
1. A designated technologist must review and verify all patient result entries in the LIS.
2. Report critical values immediately to the requesting physician as per the laboratory’s critical results policy.
3. Print reports and verify that the patient demographic information and result units are correct before releasing the final report.
1. SAFETY AND WASTE DISPOSAL
1. Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE)
including gloves and lab coat.
2. Handle and dispose of biological samples and reagents
following biosafety and laboratory waste management
protocols.
3. Clean and disinfect the workspace thoroughly after
analysis.
