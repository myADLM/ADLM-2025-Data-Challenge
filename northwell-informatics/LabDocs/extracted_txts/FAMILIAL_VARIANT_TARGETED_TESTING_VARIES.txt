Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Familial Variant, Targeted
Testing
1. PURPOSE
To provide clear guidelines for performing targeted genetic testing for
familial variants and reporting results.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing the
genetic testing, data analysis, and reporting results. It is the
responsibility of all staff to follow these guidelines to ensure accurate
and reliable test results.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Acceptable Specimens:
• Peripheral blood: 3-5 mL in EDTA (lavender-top) tube, stored and
shipped at room temperature.
• Buccal swabs: Collected using buccal swab kits, stored and
shipped at room temperature.
• Saliva samples: Collected using saliva collection kits, stored and
shipped at room temperature.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens arriving in the laboratory without collection date/time
indicated on the sample container or requisition.
• Specimens received in heparin tubes or other anticoagulants that
are not EDTA.
• Specimens that are clotted or hemolyzed.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• DNA extraction kits (e.g., Qiagen or equivalent)
• Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) reagents (e.g., Taq
polymerase, primers specific for familial variant)
• Gel electrophoresis equipment
• Real-time PCR machine
• Sequencing equipment (e.g., Sanger sequencing or NGS
platform)
• Appropriate software for sequence analysis
1. PROCEDURE
A. DNA Extraction:
1. Extract DNA from the specimen using the DNA extraction kit
according to manufacturer instructions.
2. Quantify and assess the purity of extracted DNA using a
nanophotometer or equivalent device.
B. PCR Amplification:
1. Set up PCR reactions using specific primers designed for the
familial variant.
2. Perform PCR amplification under optimal conditions
(temperature cycles, number of cycles).
3. Confirm successful amplification by running the PCR product
on a gel electrophoresis system.
C. Sequencing:
1. Purify PCR products using a purification kit.
2. Set up sequencing reactions using sequencing primers and
reagents.
3. Perform sequencing on an appropriate platform (Sanger or
NGS).
4. Analyze sequencing data using appropriate software.
D. Data Analysis:
1. Compare sequencing results to reference databases to identify
the familial variant.
2. Confirm the presence or absence of the targeted variant.
3. QUALITY CONTROL
A. Internal Quality Control:
1. Run positive and negative controls with each batch of samples.
2. Verify the accuracy of the sequencing data by including known
variant samples.
3. Document all control results and corrective actions taken when
controls fail.
B. External Quality Control:
1. Participate in external proficiency testing programs.
2. Validate newly introduced reagents or equipment through
parallel testing with validated methods.
3. REPORTING RESULTS
A. Documentation:
1. Record the results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
2. Ensure all results have been reviewed and verified by the
technologist.
B. Result Communication:
1. Report findings to the ordering physician including detected
variants, interpretation, and clinical significance.
2. Use appropriate language to indicate findings: Positive for
familial variant, Negative for familial variant, or Inconclusive.
3. Include recommendations for further testing or genetic
counseling if applicable.
4. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the specific kit instructions and sequencing platform
guidelines for limitations related to sensitivity, specificity, and potential
sources of error.

1. APPENDICES
Include detailed illustrations and charts that depict the steps involved
in DNA extraction, PCR setup, sequencing protocol, and data
analysis.
By following these guidelines, laboratory personnel can ensure the
accuracy and reliability of genetic testing for familial variants. Ensure
that any deviations from the procedure are documented and
communicated to the supervising personnel.
