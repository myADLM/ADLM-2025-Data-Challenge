Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Title: Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Family Member Comparator Specimen for
Exome Sequencing
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for analyzing Family Member
Comparator Specimens for Exome Sequencing, ensuring accurate
and reliable genetic comparison results.
1. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel responsible for the
analytical phase of exome sequencing for family member comparator
specimens.
1. DEFINITIONS
• Family Member Comparator Specimen: A DNA sample from a
biological relative used for comparison in exome sequencing to
identify genetic variants.
• Exome Sequencing: A genomic technique for sequencing the
exonic regions of the gene-coding DNA in a genome.
1. RESPONSIBILITIES
• Laboratory staff are responsible for adhering to this SOP when
analyzing family member comparator specimens.
• It is the responsibility of the laboratory supervisor to ensure that
personnel are trained and proficient in this procedure.
• Quality control personnel are responsible for verifying the fidelity
and accuracy of the analysis and overseeing that all instruments
are calibrated and functioning correctly.
1. EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS
• Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) platform (e.g., Illumina,
Thermo Fisher)
• DNA extraction kits
• Library preparation kits
• PCR equipment
• Bioinformatics analytical software
• Calibrated pipettes
• Vortex mixer
• Centrifuge
1. PROCEDURE
A) Specimen Preparation and DNA Extraction:
1. Ensure that the family member comparator specimen has been
properly received and accessioned.
2. Perform DNA extraction from the provided specimen using the
designated DNA extraction kit, following the manufacturer's
protocols.
◦ Document the concentration and purity of the extracted DNA
using a spectrophotometer or Qubit fluorometer.
◦ Store the extracted DNA at -20°C until further processing.
B) Library Preparation:
1. Utilize the appropriate library preparation kit suitable for the
NGS platform in use.
2. Fragment the DNA to the desired size using enzymatic
fragmentation or mechanical shearing.
3. Perform end-repair, A-tailing, and adapter ligation as per the
library preparation kit protocol.
4. Purify the ligated product using magnetic beads or column
purification.
5. Amplify the library using PCR according to the kit instructions,
ensuring to include appropriate controls.
6. Quantify and assess the quality of the prepared library using a
bioanalyzer or equivalent instrument.
C) Sequencing:
1. Prepare the sequencer as per the manufacturer’s guidelines,
ensuring proper calibration and maintenance.
2. Load the prepared library into the sequencer, following
appropriate pooling strategies if processing multiple samples.
3. Run the exome sequencing protocol, ensuring real-time
monitoring of sequencing performance and quality metrics.
4. Upon completion, transfer raw sequencing data to the
bioinformatics pipeline for analysis.
D) Bioinformatics Analysis:
1. Perform quality control checks on raw sequencing reads using
software tools (e.g., FastQC).
2. Trim low-quality reads and adapter sequences using tools like
Trimmomatic or Cutadapt.
3. Align the processed reads to the reference genome (e.g.,
GRCh38) using an aligner such as BWA or Bowtie2.
4. Utilize variant calling software (e.g., GATK, FreeBayes) to
identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and indels.
5. Annotate identified variants using tools like ANNOVAR or VEP.
6. Compare the exome sequence data of the family member
comparator specimen with the patient's exome data to identify
shared and unique genetic variants, following standardized
analysis pipelines.
E) Data Interpretation and Reporting:
1. Review the annotated variants for pathogenicity using
databases like ClinVar, OMIM, and HGMD.
2. Compile a detailed report summarizing the findings, highlighting
significant genetic variants relevant to the clinical context.
3. Ensure a secondary review of the report by a qualified
geneticist or molecular biologist.
4. Communicate the final report to the ordering clinician via the
laboratory information system (LIS).
5. QUALITY CONTROL
• Verify calibration and maintenance status of all equipment before
use.
• Include positive and negative controls at various stages of the
process to ensure accurate and reliable results.
• Document all steps, observations, and deviations in the laboratory
logbook.
• Perform periodic audits of the process to ensure adherence to
SOP and regulatory standards.
1. SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS
• Follow all relevant biosafety protocols while handling specimens
and reagents.
• Utilize appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) at all
times.
• Dispose of all waste materials according to biohazard waste
disposal guidelines.
