1. PURPOSE
This protocol outlines the procedures for the analytical phase of
generating results for family member comparator specimens for
genome sequencing. The aim is to ensure accurate and reliable
processing and analysis of genomic data to aid in genetic
comparisons within families.
Responsibility:
• It is the responsibility of the designated staff to carry out the
procedures outlined in this protocol.
• All laboratory personnel must ensure adherence to SOPs, ensure
the quality and integrity of the specimens and interpret the results
accurately.
• The designated laboratory supervisor/manager is responsible for
overseeing the analysis and addressing any discrepancies.
1. DEFINITIONS
Family Member Comparator Specimen: Biological specimen
collected from one or more family members for the purpose of
genetic comparison in genome sequencing studies.
1. PROCEDURE
3A: Specimen Reception and Preparation
1. Verify that family member comparator specimens have been
correctly labeled with patient identifiers, collection date, and
relevant clinical information.
2. Record specimen details in the laboratory information
management system (LIMS).
3. Inspect specimens for integrity and acceptability following
predefined criteria.
4. If specimens are acceptable, proceed to DNA extraction. If
unacceptable, coordinate for recollection.
3B: DNA Extraction and Quantification
1. Follow the standard DNA extraction protocol applicable to the
specimen type (e.g., blood, saliva).
2. Ensure that DNA extraction is performed in a clean,
contamination-free environment.
3. Quantify and assess the quality of extracted DNA using
spectrophotometry (e.g., Nanodrop) and gel electrophoresis,
documenting all findings.
4. If DNA quality and quantity are within acceptable limits, proceed
to library preparation. If deviations occur, take corrective actions
that may include re-extraction.
3C: Library Preparation and Quality Control
1. Prepare sequencing libraries using the appropriate kit and
protocol, ensuring proper indexing for each family member
comparator specimen.
2. Perform quality control of the libraries using techniques such as
capillary electrophoresis (e.g., Bioanalyzer). Document the
results.
3. Normalize the concentration of libraries to ensure uniformity for
sequencer loading.
3D: Sequencing
1. Load the prepared libraries onto the sequencer following the
manufacturer's instructions.
2. Confirm correct placement and configuration of the library
pools.
3. Initiate sequencing runs and closely monitor the process for any
errors or inconsistencies.
4. Ensure that all run parameters meet the sequencing quality
criteria defined by the laboratory.
3E: Data Analysis
1. Use bioinformatics pipelines to process the raw sequencing
data, including quality assessment, alignment to reference
genome, and variant calling.
2. Conduct family-based variant annotation and analysis using
standardized tools and databases. Verify the analysis results.
3. Generate a comprehensive report that includes the identified
variants and their potential clinical significance. Ensure that
findings are interpretable in the familial context.
3F: Quality Assurance
1. Perform internal quality control assessments at every step,
adhering to the laboratory’s QA/QC programs.
2. Compare findings with previously validated results or known
controls to confirm accuracy and consistency.
3. Document all quality control measures and corrective actions to
maintain the integrity of the analysis.
4. REPORTING RESULTS
5. Results are to be reviewed and interpreted by a qualified
laboratory scientist or geneticist.
6. Document findings in a structured format that is consistent with
laboratory templates and regulatory requirements.
7. Prepare reports for release, ensuring clarity and inclusion of all
relevant genetic findings and recommendations.
8. Communicate results to the ordering clinician or genetic
counselor in a timely manner.
9. REFERENCES
List applicable references, including guidelines from relevant
regulatory bodies, published protocols, and manufacturer's
instructions for the reagents and equipment used.
1. APPENDICES
Include appendices as necessary, such as standard templates for
documentation, detailed flowcharts of procedures, contact
information for support essentials, and troubleshooting guides.
1. REVIEW AND REVISION LOG
Document the date of the latest review and any amendments made.
Ensure protocols are regularly updated to reflect the latest technical
and regulatory developments.
