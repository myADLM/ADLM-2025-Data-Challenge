Approved by: [Approver Name]
Version: 1.0
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the analytical phase of
generating results for the Fanconi Mutagen Sensitivity Study. This
document ensures consistent and accurate handling, processing, and
reporting of the study results.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel involved in the analytical
phase of the Fanconi Mutagen Sensitivity Study within a CLIA-
certified laboratory.
3. DEFINITIONS
• FANCONI MUTAGEN SENSITIVITY STUDY: A test to assess
chromosomal breakage sensitivity using peripheral blood
lymphocytes, cultured and treated with a cross-linking agent (e.g.,
diepoxybutane or mitomycin C).
4. RESPONSIBILITY
• Laboratory Technologists: Perform all procedures as outlined,
ensure the accuracy of results, and maintain documentation.
• Supervisors: Ensure that staff adhere to this SOP and address
any deficiencies or issues.
5. MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT
• Peripheral Blood Lymphocytes
• Culture Media (RPMI-1640 or equivalent)
• Cross-linking Agents (e.g., Diepoxybutane, Mitomycin C)
• Incubator (maintained at 37°C with 5% CO2)
• Heating Blocks
• Refrigerators/Freezers
• Microscopes
• Centrifuge
• Chromosome Staining Reagents
• Sterile equipment (pipettes, tubes, etc.)
• Temperature and humidity monitoring devices
6. PROCEDURE
A) Culture Preparation
1. Sample Preparation:
◦ Collect peripheral blood samples using heparinized tubes.
◦ Process samples within 6 hours of collection.
◦ Isolate lymphocytes using Ficoll gradient centrifugation.
2. Culture Setup:
◦ Suspend isolated lymphocytes in culture media to the
appropriate cell density (according to study requirements).
◦ Set up duplicate cultures for each sample.
3. Addition of Cross-linking Agent:
◦ Add the specified concentration of the cross-linking agent to
the cultures.
◦ Ensure proper mixing and document the exact time of
addition.
4. Incubation:
◦ Incubate cultures at 37°C with 5% CO2 for the necessary
duration (e.g., 48 - 72 hours).
◦ Monitor and document culture conditions, including
temperature and CO2 levels.
B) Chromosome Analysis
1. Harvesting Cells:
◦ After incubation, stop cell cycles using colcemid.
◦ Collect cell suspensions and centrifuge to concentrate cells.
2. Chromosome Preparation:
◦ Prepare metaphase spreads using hypotonic treatment
followed by fixation (methanol:acetic acid).
◦ Stain chromosomes using Giemsa or an appropriate
staining method.
3. Microscopic Examination:
◦ Analyze metaphase spreads under the microscope.
◦ Count chromosomal breakages and aberrations using
established criteria.
C) Quality Control
1. Internal Controls:
◦ Include positive and negative controls in each batch of
cultures.
◦ Record results of control samples to ensure assay reliability.
2. Correcting Deviations:
◦ Follow troubleshooting steps if control results fall outside
acceptable limits.
D) Data Recording and Reporting
1. Documentation:
◦ Record all observations, calculations, and results in the
appropriate laboratory logbook.
◦ Include date, time, initials of the technologist, and any
relevant notes.
2. Result Calculation:
◦ Calculate frequency of chromosomal breakages per
genome.
◦ Verify results with duplicate cultures.
3. Reporting:
◦ Input results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
◦ Verify accuracy of reported results.
◦ Ensure all critical results flagged appropriately and
communicated per established protocols.

8. REVIEW AND REVISION
This SOP will be reviewed annually and revised as necessary to
ensure compliance with current standards and practices.
