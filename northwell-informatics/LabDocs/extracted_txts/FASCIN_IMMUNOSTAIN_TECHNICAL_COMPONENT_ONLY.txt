Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for FASCIN
IMMUNOSTAIN, TECHNICAL COMPONENT ONLY
1. PURPOSE
To provide precise and standardized procedures for performing the
technical component of fascin immunostain in the laboratory to
ensure accurate and reliable results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all designated laboratory personnel to
perform the steps outlined in this SOP. Supervisors must ensure that
all technicians are trained and proficient in these procedures.
3. MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT
• Antibody: Anti-Fascin primary antibody
• Secondary antibody: appropriate for detection
• Detection Kit: HRP-conjugated polymer detection kit
• Chromogen: DAB or similar substrate
• Positive Control Tissue: tissue known to express Fascin
• Negative Control Tissue: tissue lacking Fascin expression
• Slides with formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue
sections
• Xylene
• Ethanol (100%, 95%, 70%)
• Distilled Water
• Tris-buffered saline (TBS) or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)
• Hematoxylin
• Mounting medium
• Coverslips
• Heat source for antigen retrieval (e.g. microwave, pressure
cooker)
• Humidified chamber
• Slide staining rack
4. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation of Slides
1. Deparaffinization and Rehydration
◦ Place the slides in a slide holder.
◦ Immerse slides in xylene for 10 minutes (two changes).
◦ Immerse slides in 100% ethanol for 5 minutes (two
changes).
◦ Immerse slides in 95% ethanol for 5 minutes.
◦ Immerse slides in 70% ethanol for 5 minutes.
◦ Rinse slides in distilled water.
2. Antigen Retrieval
◦ Place slides in a suitable container with antigen retrieval
buffer.
◦ Heat the slides using a microwave or pressure cooker as
recommended by the antibody manufacturer.
◦ Allow slides to cool to room temperature, and then rinse in
TBS or PBS.
B. Immunostaining
1. Blocking Non-specific Binding
◦ Incubate slides with blocking solution as specified by the
antibody protocol for 10-20 minutes at room temperature.
2. Application of Primary Antibody
◦ Dilute the primary anti-Fascin antibody according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Apply the diluted primary antibody to the tissue sections.
◦ Place slides in a humidified chamber and incubate for 1
hour at room temperature or overnight at 4°C.
3. Washing
◦ Wash slides in TBS or PBS for 5 minutes (three changes).
4. Application of Secondary Antibody
◦ Apply the secondary antibody or polymer detection reagent
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Incubate slides in the humidified chamber for the time
recommended by the manufacturer.
5. Washing
◦ Wash slides in TBS or PBS for 5 minutes (three changes).
6. Chromogen Development
◦ Prepare chromogen solution as per the manufacturer’s
instructions (e.g., DAB).
◦ Apply the chromogen to each slide and incubate for the
recommended time, typically 2-10 minutes.
◦ Monitor the development under a microscope to prevent
over-development.
◦ Rinse slides in distilled water to stop the reaction.
7. Counterstaining
◦ Dip slides in hematoxylin for 30 seconds to 2 minutes to
counterstain nuclei.
◦ Rinse slides in distilled water.
◦ Differentiate in acid alcohol if necessary (specific to
hematoxylin used).
◦ Rinse in distilled water.
◦ Immerse slides in a bluing agent (e.g., ammonia water or
Scotts tap water substitute) for 30 seconds.
◦ Rinse slides in distilled water.
8. Dehydration and Mounting
◦ Dehydrate slides through graded ethanol (70%, 95%, and
100%) for 5 minutes each.
◦ Clear in xylene for 10 minutes (two changes).
◦ Apply mounting medium.
◦ Cover with coverslips.
C. Quality Control
1. Include both positive and negative control slides in each run to
ensure staining accuracy and specificity.
2. Examine control slides under a microscope:
◦ Positive control should show specific staining.
◦ Negative control should show no staining.
5. REPORTING RESULTS
Technical results are prepared and reviewed by designated
personnel. Any discrepancies or anomalies must be discussed and
resolved prior to reporting.
6. DOCUMENTATION
All steps and observations must be documented in the laboratory
records, including the date, time, and initials of the technician
performing the procedure.
7. REFERENCES
Refer to the Fascin antibody data sheet and reagent kit inserts for
detailed information and technical support.
By following this SOP, laboratory personnel will ensure that the fascin
immunostaining procedure is performed consistently and accurately,
contributing to reliable and reproducible results.
