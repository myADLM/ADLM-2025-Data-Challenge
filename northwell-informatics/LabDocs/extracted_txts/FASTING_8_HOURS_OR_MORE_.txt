Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Fasting Blood Glucose
Testing
1. PURPOSE
To guide laboratory personnel in the process of conducting fasting
blood glucose tests on patients who have fasted for 8 hours or more.
The objective is to ensure accurate and consistent results for the
evaluation of glucose metabolism.
Responsibility:
All laboratory staff are responsible for adhering to this SOP.
Supervisors are responsible for ensuring compliance and addressing
any issues or irregularities.
1. DEFINITION
Fasting Blood Glucose Test: A test conducted on a blood sample
taken from a patient after they have fasted (no caloric intake) for at
least 8 hours.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred Specimen: Venous blood collected in a sodium fluoride/
potassium oxalate tube (gray-top).
• Specimen Volume: Minimum 2 mL of whole blood.
• Specimen Stability: Store at room temperature for up to 8 hours or
refrigerate at 2-8°C for up to 24 hours if testing is delayed.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Glucose analyzer (e.g., hexokinase or glucose oxidase method)
• Calibrated pipettes
• Centrifuge
• Sodium fluoride/potassium oxalate tubes (gray-top)
• Gloves and personal protective equipment (PPE)
• Quality control materials (high, medium, and low)
1. PROCEDURE
5.1 Blood Collection
1. Verify patient’s identification and ensure they have fasted for at
least 8 hours (water intake is permitted).
2. Collect venous blood sample in a sodium fluoride/potassium
oxalate tube, ensuring minimal hemolysis.
3. Label the specimen with the patient’s information, date, and
time of collection.
5.2 Specimen Processing
1. Gently invert the tube 5-10 times immediately after collection to
mix the anticoagulant with the blood.
2. Transport the sample to the laboratory promptly.
3. If testing will be delayed, refrigerate the sample at 2-8°C.
5.3 Testing Procedure
1. Calibrate the glucose analyzer according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
2. Run quality control materials at the beginning of each shift and
after any maintenance or calibration activities. Record the QC
results.
3. Centrifuge the specimen at 3000 RPM for 10 minutes to
separate plasma from cells.
4. Pipette the required volume of plasma into a clean sample cup
or directly into the analyzer, following the instrument’s
instructions.
5. Analyze the sample using the glucose analyzer.
5.4 Result Verification and Reporting
1. Review the results for any flags or errors indicated by the
analyzer.
2. Compare the results against the reference intervals (typically
70-99 mg/dL for fasting glucose).
3. Report any critical values (e.g., < 50 mg/dL or > 400 mg/dL) to
the patient’s physician immediately.
4. Enter the results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
and ensure all data is accurately transcribed.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
6. Use quality control materials (high, medium, and low) to verify
the accuracy and precision of the glucose analyzer.
7. Document QC results and take corrective actions if any results
fall outside the acceptable range.
8. Participate in external proficiency testing programs to ensure
the accuracy and reliability of the test results.
9. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Normal fasting glucose: 70-99 mg/dL
• Impaired fasting glucose (prediabetes): 100-125 mg/dL
• Diabetes: ≥ 126 mg/dL (on more than one occasion)
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolysis may falsely lower glucose values.
• Improper mixing of the sample with the anticoagulant can result in
clot formation and inaccurate results.
• Delay in processing the specimen can lead to glycolysis and
decreased glucose levels.

needed based on updates in technology or laboratory practices.
