Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Fatty Acid Oxidation Gene Panel
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedures required to
generate accurate and reliable results for the Fatty Acid Oxidation
Gene Panel (FAOGP). This panel tests for gene mutations
associated with disorders in fatty acid oxidation, utilizing next-
generation sequencing (NGS) technology. The procedures include
preparation, sequencing, data analysis, quality control, and reporting
of results.
1. SCOPE This SOP applies to all personnel involved in the
analytical phase of testing for the Fatty Acid Oxidation Gene
Panel.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
• Laboratory Technologists: Responsible for specimen handling,
preparation, sequencing, initial data analysis, and quality control.
• Bioinformaticians: Responsible for advanced data analysis.
• Laboratory Directors: Responsible for the final review and
approval of test results.
• Quality Assurance Team: Responsible for ensuring compliance
with SOP and maintaining adequate documentation of all steps.
1. MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT
• Sequencing instruments (e.g., Illumina MiSeq or NovaSeq)
• Pipette and pipette tips
• NGS library preparation kits
• PCR reagents and equipment
• Thermocyclers
• DNA quantification instruments (e.g., Qubit or NanoDrop)
• Bioinformatics software (e.g., BaseSpace, GATK, VarSeq)
• Computer hardware with adequate storage and processing
capacity
1. PROCEDURE
A) PREPARATION
1. Verify specimen integrity.
◦ Ensure the specimen meets the acceptance criteria (e.g.,
sufficient quantity, no contamination).
◦ Record specimen details including accession number.
2. Extract DNA from the specimen following standard protocols.
◦ Quantify the DNA concentration using Qubit or NanoDrop.
◦ Record DNA concentration and purity on the specimen log.
B) LIBRARY PREPARATION
1. Perform library preparation using NGS library preparation kits.
◦ Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for the specific kit
used.
◦ Use proper controls to ensure library prep quality.
2. Validate the prepared library.
◦ Quantify and assess the quality of the library using an
appropriate method (e.g., Bioanalyzer or TapeStation).
C) SEQUENCING
1. Load the prepared libraries onto the sequencing instrument.
◦ Program the instrument with appropriate run settings for the
FAOGP.
◦ Monitor the sequencing run to ensure proper operation.
D) DATA ANALYSIS
1. Initial data processing using bioinformatics software.
◦ De-multiplex sequences.
◦ Adapter trimming and quality checks.
◦ Align sequences to the reference genome.
2. Perform variant calling.
◦ Identify potential mutations linked to fatty acid oxidation
disorders.
◦ Annotate variants using databases such as ClinVar or
dbSNP.
E) QUALITY CONTROL
1. Validate results with internal controls.
◦ Check sequencing quality metrics (e.g., coverage, depth).
◦ Ensure that controls are within accepted tolerance limits.
2. Review data for consistency and accuracy.
◦ Perform a second review of variants.
◦ Confirm that all findings meet analytical and clinical
validation criteria.
F) REPORTING RESULTS
1. Generate a detailed report for the Fatty Acid Oxidation Gene
Panel.
◦ Include specimen details, methodology, detected variants,
and their clinical significance.
◦ Attach supporting documentation (e.g., quality control
results, variant interpretations).
2. Laboratory Director reviews and approves the report.
3. Release the report to the requesting clinician.
◦ Ensure confidential and secure transmission of results.
4. QUALITY ASSURANCE
• Ensure all procedures adhere to regulatory requirements (e.g.,
CLIA, CAP).
• Document all steps meticulously, including any deviations from
the SOP and corrective actions taken.
• Regularly review and update the SOP to incorporate
advancements in technology and methodology.
