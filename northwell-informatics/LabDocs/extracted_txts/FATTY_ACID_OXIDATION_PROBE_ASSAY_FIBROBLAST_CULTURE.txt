Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): FATTY ACID OXIDATION
PROBE ASSAY, FIBROBLAST CULTURE
1. PURPOSE
To provide a detailed protocol for the analytical phase of generating
results for the Fatty Acid Oxidation Probe Assay using cultured
fibroblast cells, ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the results.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of the trained laboratory personnel to perform
the assay following this SOP. This includes preparation, execution,
data analysis and interpretation, and documentation of the results.
Any deviations or issues should be immediately reported to the
supervisor.
1. DEFINITIONS
Fatty Acid Oxidation Probe Assay: A biochemical test used to analyze
the ability of fibroblast cells to oxidize fatty acids, which can be
crucial for diagnosing metabolic disorders.
Fibroblast Culture: Cultivation of fibroblast cells in a controlled
environment to obtain sufficient cell quantity and quality for
biochemical assays.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• CO2 Incubator
• Centrifuge
• Laminar flow hood
• Brightfield microscope
• Tissue culture plates (6-well, 12-well, or 24-well)
• Growth medium (Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium - DMEM,
fetal bovine serum - FBS)
• Probe substrate (radiolabeled fatty acid or fluorescent fatty acid
analog)
• Specific reagents (heparin, trypsin, phosphate-buffered saline,
etc.)
• Analytical instruments: Gamma counter or fluorescent plate
reader
1. PROCEDURE
A) Cell Preparation:
1. Prepare fibroblast culture in CO2 incubator at 37°C with 5%
CO2.
2. Harvest cells using trypsin and transfer to tissue culture plates.
3. Allow cells to adhere and grow to 70-80% confluence.
B) Assay Setup:
1. Prepare fatty acid oxidation assay medium:
◦ Add appropriate concentration of the probe substrate to the
growth medium.
2. Pipette the assay medium into cell culture wells.
C) Fatty Acid Oxidation Assay:
1. Incubate cells with assay medium for a specified time period
(usually 2-4 hours).
2. Terminate the reaction:
◦ If using radiolabeled fatty acids, harvest cells and separate
fractions.
◦ If using fluorescent probes, wash the cells to remove excess
substrate.
3. Cell Lysis:
◦ Use appropriate lysis buffer to lyse cells.
4. Collect supernatant and/or cell fractions for quantitative
analysis.
D) Analytical Measurement:
• For radiolabeled fatty acids, measure radioactivity using a gamma
counter.
• For fluorescent probes, measure fluorescence intensity using a
plate reader.
E) Data Analysis:
1. Calculate fatty acid oxidation rates based on standard curves
and control samples.
2. Normalize data to cell number or protein content.
3. Document and analyze for any deviations from expected
results.
4. QUALITY CONTROL AND TROUBLESHOOTING
A) Quality Control:
• Include positive and negative controls in each assay batch.
• Ensure the calibration of analytical instruments according to
manufacturer specifications.
• Perform regular checks on incubators, centrifuge, laminar flow
hood, and other equipment used.
B) Troubleshooting:
• If assay results are inconsistent, check for cell confluence,
medium preparation, substrate concentration, and instrument
calibration.
• Contaminated cultures or reagent deterioration should be
reported, and affected assays should be repeated with fresh
cultures and reagents.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Record all results in designated laboratory logbooks.
• Review results for any outliers or inconsistencies.
• Report results according to lab reporting guidelines: include assay
run details, control results, and any notes on deviations.
Reference Intervals:
• Refer to established reference intervals for fatty acid oxidation
rates.
Method Limitations:
• High cell variability, contamination, and reagent instability can
affect results. Specific probe substrate limitations should be
consulted in their respective product inserts.
References: Consult relevant scientific literature and technical inserts
of probe substrates and specific reagents.
By following this SOP, laboratory personnel can ensure the accuracy,
reliability, and proper documentation of results for the Fatty Acid
Oxidation Probe Assay in fibroblast cultures.
