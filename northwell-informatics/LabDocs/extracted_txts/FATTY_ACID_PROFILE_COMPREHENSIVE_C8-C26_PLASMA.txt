SOP FOR GENERATING FATTY ACID PROFILE,
COMPREHENSIVE (C8-C26), PLASMA
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the analysis and reporting of
the comprehensive fatty acid profile (C8-C26) in plasma samples.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the fatty
acid profile analysis and ensuring that results are accurate and
reported in a timely manner. It is also their responsibility to identify
any deficiencies in the process and notify the supervisor.
1. DEFINITION
Fatty acid profiling involves the identification and quantification of
fatty acids with carbon chain lengths ranging from C8 to C26 in
plasma. The analysis is crucial for assessing lipid metabolism and
potential metabolic disorders.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
A. Specimen Type:
• Plasma collected in EDTA tubes.
B. Specimen Handling:
• Plasma must be separated from whole blood within 30 minutes of
collection.
• Samples should be collected after at least 12 hours of fasting.
• Store samples at -80°C if not analyzed immediately.
C. Unacceptable Conditions:
• Samples that are hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric.
• Whole blood not separated within recommended time frame.
• Plasma samples not stored at the proper temperature.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS) or Gas
Chromatography with Flame Ionization Detection (GC-FID).
• Heptane or hexane.
• Methanolic HCl or boron trifluoride (BF3) for methylation.
• Analytical grade internal standards for fatty acid methyl esters
(FAME).
• Calibration standards for C8-C26 FAME.
• Vials and caps suitable for GC.
• Appropriate software for data acquisition and analysis.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation of Standards and Reagents:
• Prepare calibration standards for C8-C26 fatty acids according to
manufacturer's instructions.
• Prepare internal standards for quantification.
• Prepare reagents for methylation of fatty acids.
B. Sample Preparation:
1. Aliquot 200 µL of plasma into a glass test tube.
2. Add 1 mL of methanolic HCl or BF3 reagent.
3. Add a known quantity of internal standard to each sample.
4. Vortex mix for 1 minute to ensure thorough mixing.
5. Heat tubes in a water bath at 60°C for 60 minutes for
methylation.
6. Cool tubes to room temperature and add 1 mL of heptane or
hexane to extract FAMEs.
7. Vortex mix for 2 minutes and centrifuge at 3000 rpm for 10
minutes.
8. Carefully transfer the upper organic layer to a GC vial.
C. GC/MS or GC-FID Analysis:
1. Load the prepared samples and calibration standards onto the
GC.
2. Set the temperature program specific for separating fatty acid
methyl esters (standard method: initial temperature 70°C, ramp
to 280°C at 20°C per minute).
3. Inject an appropriate volume (e.g., 2 µL) of each sample.
4. Analyze the samples following the specific method parameters
for the GC equipment.
D. Data Analysis:
1. Identify fatty acid peaks by comparing retention times with
those of the calibration standards.
2. Quantify each fatty acid methyl ester using the internal standard
method.
3. Calculate the concentration of each fatty acid (C8-C26) in the
plasma sample.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
A. Internal controls:
• Run a known control sample with each batch of patient samples
to ensure analytical performance.
B. Calibration:
• Use a multi-point calibration curve for each batch to ensure
linearity and accuracy.
• Ensure each calibration point passes acceptance criteria before
proceeding.
C. Proficiency Testing:
• Participate in external quality assessment schemes for fatty acid
profiling periodically.
• Review and document results according to established guidelines.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
A. Verify all data for accuracy and consistency:
• Ensure all control and calibration standards are within acceptable
ranges.
B. Document and report results:
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Review and cross-verify by two different staff members where
applicable.
C. Critical Values:
• Flag and report any values that fall outside the reference intervals
to the ordering physician immediately.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Refer to specific laboratory reference ranges established or
provided by literature/internal validation.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Ensure awareness of the limitations such as interferences or
technical issues that may affect the analysis of specific fatty acids.
