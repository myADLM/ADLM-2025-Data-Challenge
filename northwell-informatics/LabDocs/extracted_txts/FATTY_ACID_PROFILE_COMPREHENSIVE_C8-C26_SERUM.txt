Standard Operating Procedure
Title: Analytical Phase for Fatty Acid Profile, Comprehensive (C8-
C26), Serum
1. Purpose
To outline the procedure for the analysis of a comprehensive fatty
acid profile (C8-C26) in serum samples. This procedure ensures
accuracy, reliability, and consistency in the generation of results.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory staff will conduct the analysis according to
this SOP.
• Supervisors must ensure that all personnel are trained and
comply with the procedure.
• It is the responsibility of all staff to identify any deviations and
report them to a supervisor.
1. Specimen Requirements
Acceptable Specimens:
• Serum collected in plain, red-top tubes or serum gel tubes.
• Ideal volume: 1.0 mL (minimum: 0.5 mL).
• Specimens should be refrigerated (2-8°C) and analyzed within 7
days of collection. If longer storage is required, serum should be
frozen at -20°C or lower.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed samples.
• Specimens not stored at appropriate temperatures.
• Serum that has been frozen and thawed multiple times.
1. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies
• Gas Chromatograph with Flame Ionization Detector (GC-FID)
• Column: BPX70, 60m, 0.25mm ID, 0.25µm film thickness
• Calibration standards: Certified Fatty Acid Methyl Esters (FAMEs)
• Internal standards: C17:0 Methyl Ester
• Solvents: Hexane, Chloroform, Methanol, Boron trifluoride in
methanol (BF3-MeOH)
• Pipettes and disposable tips
• Vortex mixer
• Centrifuge
• Incubator
• Test tubes and caps
• Protective equipment and lab attire
1. Procedure
Sample Preparation:
1. Lipid Extraction:
◦ Aliquot 100 µL of the serum sample into a clean, labeled test
tube.
◦ Add 1 mL of chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) to the serum
sample.
◦ Vortex thoroughly for 1 minute.
◦ Centrifuge at 1500 x g for 10 minutes to separate the
phases.
◦ Transfer the lower chloroform layer containing lipids to a
new test tube.
2. Methylation:
◦ Evaporate the chloroform under a stream of nitrogen or in a
vacuum centrifuge.
◦ Add 1 mL of BF3-MeOH reagent to the dried lipids.
◦ Cap the test tube tightly and incubate at 100°C for 60
minutes.
◦ After cooling to room temperature, add 1 mL of hexane and
1 mL of water.
◦ Vortex and centrifuge at 1500 x g for 5 minutes.
◦ Transfer the upper hexane layer containing FAMEs to a new
labeled GC vial.
Gas Chromatography Analysis:
1. Equipment Setup:
◦ Ensure the GC-FID is calibrated and the column is
conditioned.
◦ Set the temperature program according to the instrument
manual specific for fatty acid analysis.
◦ Inject 1 µL of the prepared FAME sample into the GC.
2. Run Control and Calibration:
◦ Run a set of calibration standards (FAME mix) to establish a
calibration curve.
◦ Include quality control samples (low, medium, high) at the
start, intermittently, and at the end of the sample batch.
◦ Inject the prepared serum sample FAME extract.
3. Data Acquisition and Analysis:
◦ Monitor the GC run to ensure proper separation and
detection of fatty acids.
◦ Use the software to integrate peaks and derive
concentrations based on the calibration curve.
◦ Ensure each fatty acid peak (C8-C26) is correctly identified
and quantified.
4. Quality Control:
◦ Review the quality control samples to ensure they fall within
acceptable ranges.
◦ If QC fails, identify and rectify the issue before proceeding
with further sample analyses.
5. Documentation and Data Review:
◦ Document the sample run data, including any deviations or
issues encountered.
◦ Review the analyzed data for any inconsistencies. Flag any
abnormal results for further verification.
◦ Record all data in the laboratory information system (LIS).
1. Reporting Results
Reference Intervals:
• Individual reference intervals for each fatty acid (C8-C26) will be
provided according to validated laboratory data.
Report in LIS:
• Enter results into the LIS promptly. Each discrepancy must be
addressed before verification.
• Ensure all critical values or abnormal findings are communicated
according to laboratory policy.
1. Points to Note
Safety Warnings:
• Handle all solvents and reagents in a fume hood.
• Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) including
gloves, lab coat, and safety glasses.
Method Limitations:
• Any preprocessing errors, such as incomplete methylation or
insufficient phase separations, can affect the accuracy of results.
• Ensure equipment maintenance and calibration are regularly
performed to avoid issues during analysis.
References:
• Include relevant references or protocols from instrument
manufacturers and standard literature for analytical methodology.
