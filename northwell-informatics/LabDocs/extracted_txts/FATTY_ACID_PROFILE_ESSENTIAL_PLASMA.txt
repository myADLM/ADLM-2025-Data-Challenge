SOP for the Analytical Phase of Generating Results for Fatty Acid
Profile, Essential, Plasma
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedures for generating results for the Fatty Acid
Profile, Essential, Plasma test, ensuring accuracy and consistency in
the analysis, documentation, and reporting of laboratory results.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the fatty
acid profile analysis and documenting results as defined in this
procedure. Supervisors and quality managers are responsible for
ensuring that all procedures are followed correctly and that corrective
actions are taken when necessary.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen Collection:
• Preferred: 5 mL of fasting plasma sample collected in EDTA
tubes.
• Unacceptable: Samples collected in sodium citrate, sodium
fluoride/oxalate, heparinized tubes that are not PST, or specimens
with visible signs of hemolysis.
Specimen Stability:
• Plasma should be promptly separated from cells within 30
minutes of collection.
• Store separated plasma at -80°C for up to 6 months.
• Samples must be transported to the laboratory on dry ice to
maintain stability.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Gas Chromatography–Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) or Gas
Chromatography–Flame Ionization Detection (GC-FID)
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Vortex mixer
• Refrigerated storage unit (-80°C)
Reagents:
• Methanol, HPLC grade
• Hexane, HPLC grade
• Sodium methoxide
• Fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) standards
Supplies:
• EDTA collection tubes
• Disposable pipette tips
• Calibration standards
• Sample vials
• Gloves, lab coats, and other PPE (Personal Protective
Equipment)
1. PROCEDURE
Sample Preparation:
1. Thaw frozen plasma samples at room temperature.
2. Vortex the sample for 30 seconds to ensure homogeneity.
3. Transfer 100 µL of plasma into a clean sample vial.
4. Add 2 mL of methanol and vortex for 1 minute.
5. Add 1 mL of sodium methoxide and incubate at 55°C for 30
minutes to methylate fatty acids.
6. Cool the sample to room temperature.
7. Add 2 mL of hexane to extract FAMEs and vortex for 30
seconds.
8. Centrifuge the sample at 3000 rpm for 5 minutes. Transfer the
upper hexane layer to a fresh vial.
GC Analysis:
1. Set up the GC-MS/GC-FID according to manufacturer’s
instructions.
2. Inject 1 µL of the hexane layer containing FAMEs into the GC
system.
3. Use appropriate calibration standards to ensure the accuracy of
the instrument.
4. Run the sample through the GC analysis and record retention
times and peak areas.
5. Compare the results to FAME standards to identify and quantify
the fatty acids.
Documentation:
1. Record the following information for each sample:
◦ Date of analysis
◦ Sample identification number
◦ Resultant fatty acid concentrations
◦ Any deviations from standard procedure or observations
2. Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS) for
review and verification.
3. QUALITY CONTROL
Internal Quality Control:
• Use quality control samples with known concentrations of fatty
acids to validate each batch of samples.
• Document and review QC results according to laboratory
protocols.
• Take corrective actions for any deviations observed.
Instrument Calibration:
• Perform instrument calibration with FAME standards every day
before sample analysis.
• Record calibration results and verify accuracy.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
Review and Verification:
• Ensure that all results are checked for consistency and accuracy.
• Review chromatograms for any irregularities or interferences.
Transmission of Results:
• Results are automatically transmitted to the LIS.
• Results must be reviewed and verified by a technologist before
final reporting.
Reference Intervals: Refer to established reference intervals for
essential fatty acids in plasma.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the GC-MS or GC-FID manufacturer’s guidelines and FAME
standard limitations for accuracy and specificity issues.
