Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Fatty Acid Profile, Essential, Serum
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this SOP is to provide standardized
procedures for the analysis of essential fatty acid profiles in
serum using gas chromatography (GC). This SOP ensures the
consistency, accuracy, and reliability of results generated.
Responsibility: It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory
personnel to perform, document, and review the analysis according
to this SOP. All staff must ensure adherence to these procedures and
report any discrepancies or issues to their supervisor.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS Specimen Type:
• Serum
Specimen Collection:
• Collect blood specimens in a serum separator tube (SST).
• Allow the blood to clot for 30 minutes at room temperature.
• Centrifuge the specimen at 1,300 - 1,800 x g for 10-15 minutes.
• Transfer serum to a clean plastic tube promptly.
• The specimen volume required is 1-2 mL of serum.
Specimen Handling and Storage:
• Store the serum samples at -20°C or lower until analysis.
• Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles, which can degrade fatty acids.
• Ensure specimens are labeled with patient information and
collection date/time.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric specimens.
• Specimens with insufficient volume.
• Specimens not stored or transported according to specified
conditions.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Gas Chromatograph (GC) with Flame Ionization Detector (FID).
• Automated/micro syringe for sample injection.
• Freezers (-20°C or lower).
Reagents:
• Internal Standards (e.g., heptadecanoic acid).
• Derivatizing Agent (e.g., BF3-methanol).
• HPLC-grade Hexane and Methanol.
• Calibration Standards (mix of known fatty acids).
Supplies:
• Glass vials with Teflon-lined caps.
• Conical glass tubes.
• Pipettes and pipette tips.
• GC columns specific for fatty acids.
1. PROCEDURE
Sample Preparation:
1. Thaw serum samples at room temperature.
2. Take 100 µL of serum in a conical glass tube.
3. Add 50 µL of internal standard (heptadecanoic acid).
4. Proceed with lipid extraction using Folch method: a. Add 1 mL
of chloroform:methanol (2:1 v/v) solution. b. Vortex for 1 minute.
c. Centrifuge at 2,000 x g for 5 minutes. d. Transfer the
chloroform (lower) layer to a new vial.
5. Evaporate the solvent under a stream of nitrogen.
6. Add 100 µL of derivatizing agent (BF3-methanol).
7. Heat the mixture at 70°C for 30 minutes to methylate fatty
acids.
8. Cool to room temperature.
9. Add 200 µL of hexane and mix thoroughly.
10. Add 300 µL of water and vortex for 1 minute.
11. Centrifuge at 2,000 x g for 5 minutes.
12. Transfer the hexane (top) layer to a GC vial and cap.
GC Analysis:
1. Set up the GC system with appropriate columns and
parameters.
2. Inject 1 µL of the prepared sample into the GC.
3. Calibrate the GC with calibration standards.
4. Perform automated or manual injection, ensuring each sample
and standard is analyzed.
5. Record retention times and peak areas.
Data Analysis:
1. Compare sample retention times and peak areas with
calibration standards.
2. Calculate fatty acid concentrations using internal standard data.
3. Verify quality control (QC) samples to ensure the accuracy of
the run.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
Internal Quality Control:
• Analyze QC samples with known fatty acid concentrations with
each batch of patient samples.
• QC samples must fall within the established acceptable range.
• If QC results are outside acceptable limits, troubleshoot, and
reanalyze affected samples.
External Quality Control:
• Participate in proficiency testing (PT) programs.
• Compare results from PT samples with reference values.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
Review and Verification:
• Technologists must review all generated data for completeness
and consistency.
• Verify that QC results meet established criteria before patient
results are accepted.
Result Entry:
• Enter verified results into the laboratory information system (LIS).
• Ensure proper documentation and communication of critical
values to clinical personnel.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Typical reference intervals for essential fatty acids measured in
serum may range as follows (specific values to be validated by the
laboratory):
• Linoleic Acid (C18:2): 20-45%
• Alpha-Linolenic Acid (C18:3): 0.2-2%
• Arachidonic Acid (C20:4): 5-15%
• Eicosapentaenoic Acid (C20:5): 0.1-1.5%
• Docosahexaenoic Acid (C22:6): 1-5%
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Ensure proper sample handling to avoid oxidation of fatty acids.
• Cross-contamination between samples may lead to erroneous
results.
• Proper calibration and maintenance of the GC system are critical
for accurate analysis.
