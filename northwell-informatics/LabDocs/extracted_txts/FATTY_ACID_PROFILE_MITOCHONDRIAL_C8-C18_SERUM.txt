Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Fatty Acid Profile, Mitochondrial (C8-C18), Serum
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of the SOP is to outline the procedure for the analytical
phase of generating results for the Fatty Acid Profile (C8-C18),
specifically for mitochondrial fatty acids in serum. This SOP ensures
that test results are reliable, accurate, and generated in a consistent
manner.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of trained laboratory personnel to follow this
procedure to ensure accurate and reliable results. Supervisors are
responsible for overseeing the process and addressing any
deviations or issues.
1. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all staff members performing the Fatty Acid
Profile (C8-C18) analysis in the laboratory.
1. DEFINITIONS
Fatty Acid Profile: A biochemical test that measures the concentration
of specific fatty acids present in the serum.
Mitochondrial Fatty Acids: Fatty acids involved in mitochondrial
metabolism, typically encompassing chain lengths from C8 to C18.
1. EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS
• Gas Chromatograph-Mass Spectrometer (GC-MS) or equivalent
• High precision analytical balance
• Centrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Water bath
• GC-MS calibration standards
• Solvent (e.g., hexane, methanol)
• Internal standard (e.g., heptadecanoic acid)
• Derivatization reagent (e.g., BSTFA with 1% TMCS)
• Serum sample
• Disposable gloves
• Clean glass vials
• Syringes and needles
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
1. PROCEDURE
6.1 Serum Preparation
6.1.1 Upon receiving the serum sample, verify the patient information
and sample integrity.
6.1.2 Allow the serum sample to reach room temperature if it has
been stored under refrigeration.
6.1.3 Vortex the sample to ensure homogeneity before aliquoting.
6.2 Sample Extraction
6.2.1 Pipette 100 µL of serum into a clean glass vial.
6.2.2 Add 50 µL of internal standard to the vial and vortex for 10
seconds.
6.2.3 Add 1 mL of solvent (hexane:methanol, 2:1) to the vial and
vortex for 30 seconds.
6.2.4 Centrifuge the mixture at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes.
6.2.5 Carefully transfer the organic (upper) layer into a new clean
glass vial.
6.3 Derivatization
6.3.1 Add 50 µL of the derivatization reagent to the organic extract in
the vial.
6.3.2 Vortex the mixture briefly and incubate the vial in a water bath
at 60°C for 30 minutes.
6.3.3 Allow the vial to cool to room temperature.
6.4 GC-MS Analysis
6.4.1 Prepare the GC-MS instrument according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
6.4.2 Inject 1 µL of the derivatized sample extract into the GC-MS.
6.4.3 Run the GC-MS program, ensuring to include calibration
standards and quality controls at the beginning, midpoint, and end of
the batch.
6.5 Data Analysis
6.5.1 Use the GC-MS software to identify peaks corresponding to C8-
C18 fatty acids.
6.5.2 Quantify the fatty acids using the internal standard method and
generate the fatty acid profile.
6.5.3 Review all chromatograms to ensure the integrity and quality of
peaks. Re-run any samples that show irregularities or are outside of
acceptable parameters.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
7.1 Run quality control samples with known concentrations of C8-
C18 fatty acids with each batch of samples.
7.2 Ensure the instrument calibration is performed regularly and
documented according to the laboratory’s schedule.
7.3 Record all quality control steps, including the preparation of
controls, daily instrument calibration, and maintenance.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
8.1 Review and validate all test results in the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
8.2 Report results in the patient’s medical record according to the
laboratory’s guidelines.
8.3 If control results fall outside acceptable ranges, do not report
patient results until the issue is resolved and all controls are within
acceptable limits.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING
9.1 If the GC-MS fails to identify or quantify a sample, check the
instrument for any maintenance issues, recalibrate if necessary, and
rerun the sample.
9.2 For ongoing issues, consult with a supervisor or instrument
technical support.
1. STORAGE AND STABILITY
10.1 Store extracted samples and derivatives at -20°C if analysis is
not immediate.
10.2 Ensure reagents and standards are stored according to
manufacturer recommendations to maintain stability and accuracy.
