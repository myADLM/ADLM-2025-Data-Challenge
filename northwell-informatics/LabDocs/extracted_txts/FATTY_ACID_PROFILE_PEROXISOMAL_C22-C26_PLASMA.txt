Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Procedure for Generating Results for Fatty Acid
Profile, Peroxisomal (C22-C26), Plasma
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized protocol for the accurate and reliable
analysis of peroxisomal fatty acid profile (C22-C26) in plasma
samples. The procedure entails the extraction, separation, and
quantification of very long-chain fatty acids to detect metabolic
disorders associated with peroxisomal function.
Responsibility:
All designated laboratory personnel involved in the analysis of
plasma fatty acid profiles are responsible for following this procedure.
It is the responsibility of individual staff members to ensure accuracy
and take corrective actions if discrepancies are found.
1. DEFINITION
The fatty acid profile includes the measurement of very long-chain
fatty acids (VLCFAs) from C22 to C26 within plasma, indicative of
peroxisomal function and relevant for diagnosing peroxisomal
disorders such as X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENT & HANDLING
3.1 Specimen Collection:
• Preferred/acceptable: 3-5 mL of EDTA plasma, collected under
fasting conditions. Specimens should be collected in a chilled
blood collection tube and processed quickly to separate the
plasma.
• Unacceptable: Specimens not maintained at appropriate
temperatures, visibly hemolyzed specimens, or those collected in
anticoagulants other than EDTA.
3.2 Specimen Handling:
• After collection, plasma samples should be immediately
separated by centrifugation at 4°C.
• Aliquot the plasma into a labeled polypropylene tube and freeze
at -80°C until analysis.
• Ensure specimens are transported on dry ice to maintain stability.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
4.1 Equipment:
• Gas Chromatograph-Mass Spectrometer (GC-MS) with
appropriate columns and detectors.
• Refrigerated centrifuge.
• Vortex mixer.
• Analytical balance.
4.2 Reagents:
• Internal standard solution specific for VLCFAs.
• Heptadecanoic acid as the reference standard.
• Derivatization reagents (e.g., MSTFA, BF3-methanol).
• Solvents: Hexane, chloroform, methanol (HPLC grade).
4.3 Supplies:
• 2 mL polypropylene microtubes.
• Pipettes and tips.
• Glass vials for GC-MS analysis.
1. PROCEDURE
5.1 Sample Preparation:
• Thaw plasma samples rapidly at 37°C and vortex thoroughly.
• Pipette 200 µL of plasma into a microtube.
• Add 50 µL of internal standard solution and vortex mix.
• Add 1 mL of chloroform:methanol (2:1, v/v) to extract lipid
components.
• Vortex for 5 minutes and centrifuge at 3000 rpm for 5 minutes to
separate phases.
• Transfer the lower organic phase into a new tube and dry under
nitrogen.
5.2 Derivatization:
• Reconstitute the dried residue in 50 µL of derivatizing reagent
(e.g., MSTFA).
• Heat the mixture at 60°C for 30 minutes to allow complete
derivatization.
• Allow the mixture to cool to room temperature and transfer to a
GC-MS vial.
5.3 GC-MS Analysis:
• Set GC-MS parameters according to the manufacturer’s
instructions for fatty acid analysis.
• Inject 1 µL of the derivatized sample into the GC-MS.
• Analyze the fatty acids using selected ion monitoring (SIM) for
VLCFAs, specifically focusing on C22, C24, C26.
• Record and integrate peaks corresponding to each fatty acid and
internal standard.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
6.1 Calibration Curve:
• Prepare calibration curves using known standards of VLCFAs.
• Ensure calibration is performed at the beginning of each analytical
run.
6.2 Quality Control Samples:
• Include quality control samples (high, medium, low) in each batch
to monitor the precision and accuracy.
• Review QC data to verify that results fall within acceptable limits
before reporting patient results.
6.3 Internal Standards:
• Use internal standards to correct for variations in extraction and
derivatization efficiency.
• Verify that the internal standard recovery is within permissible
ranges.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results are generated by comparing sample peak areas with the
calibration curve.
• Concentrations of individual fatty acids (C22, C24, C26) are
calculated.
• Report results in micromoles per liter (µmol/L).
• Document findings in the laboratory's information system and
ensure results are reviewed and verified by the assigned
technologist.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolyzed or improperly stored samples may affect the accuracy.
• Derivatization efficiency may vary leading to discrepancies.
• Provide comments on results if any abnormalities or technical
issues are observed.
