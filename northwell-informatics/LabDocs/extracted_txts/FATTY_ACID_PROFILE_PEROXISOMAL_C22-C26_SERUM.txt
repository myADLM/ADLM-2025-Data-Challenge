FATTY ACID PROFILE, PEROXISOMAL
(C22-C26), SERUM
1. PURPOSE
To provide standardized procedures for the analysis of fatty acid
profile, specifically C22-C26, in serum samples, ensuring accurate
and reliable results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of designated staff to follow this protocol to
analyze the fatty acid profile (C22-C26) in serum samples. All staff
members involved in the analytical phase must adhere to the steps
outlined in this SOP to guarantee the integrity and quality of test
results.
3. DEFINITION
The fatty acid profile analysis involves quantifying specific long-chain
fatty acids (C22-C26) in the serum to assess peroxisomal function.
This test is critical in diagnosing peroxisomal disorders.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen Collection:
• Preferred specimen: 4 mL of serum collected in red-top tubes.
• Unacceptable specimens: Hemolyzed samples, Lipemic samples,
or samples collected in tubes other than red-top tubes.
Stability:
• Serum samples should be refrigerated at 2-8°C immediately after
collection.
• Samples must reach the laboratory within 24 hours of collection.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Gas Chromatograph-Mass Spectrometer (GC-MS)
• Centrifuge
• Serum transfer tubes
Reagents:
• Internal standards for C22-C26 fatty acids
• Extraction solvents (e.g., hexane, isopropanol)
• Derivatization reagents (e.g., boron trifluoride methanol, BSTFA)
6. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation:
1. Allow serum samples to reach room temperature.
2. Centrifuge serum samples at 3000 RPM for 10 minutes.
3. Transfer the supernatant serum into a clean transfer tube.
4. Add internal standards to the serum aliquot.
B. Lipid Extraction:
1. Add appropriate volume of extraction solvent (hexane,
isopropanol) to serum aliquot.
2. Vortex samples for 2 minutes.
3. Centrifuge at 3000 RPM for 5 minutes.
4. Collect the organic phase.
C. Derivatization:
1. Transfer the organic phase to a reaction vial.
2. Add derivatization reagent (BSTFA) to the vial.
3. Incubate the sample at 70°C for 30 minutes.
D. GC-MS Analysis:
1. Load the derivatized sample into the GC-MS.
2. Configure GC-MS to the specific method for C22-C26 fatty
acids.
3. Run the analysis and quantify fatty acids using internal
standards.
E. Data Analysis:
1. Analyze the chromatograms generated by GC-MS.
2. Ensure peaks corresponding to C22-C26 are well resolved.
3. Calculate concentrations using internal standards and
calibration curves.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
A. Internal Standards:
• Ensure internal standards are added to each sample.
• Verify the recovery of internal standards with each batch of
samples.
B. Instrument Calibration:
• Calibrate the GC-MS before the analysis using calibration
standards.
• Perform periodic verification using known controls.
C. Control Samples:
Run control samples (normal and abnormal) with each batch of
patient samples to verify the accuracy and precision of the assay.
8. RESULTS REPORTING
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Review and verify results prior to reporting.
• Use reference intervals appropriate for the test.
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or improperly stored samples may interfere
with results.
• All steps must be standardized; variation in sample handling may
affect fatty acid quantification.
10. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's guidelines for GC-MS operation.
• Clinical guidelines for fatty acid profile analysis.
11. DOCUMENTATION
Ensure all steps, including calibrations, maintenance, QC results, and
patient results are thoroughly documented in accordance with
laboratory policies and procedures.
By following these procedures, we ensure accurate and reliable
analysis of the fatty acid profile (C22-C26) in serum samples, aiding
in the diagnosis and management of peroxisomal disorders.
