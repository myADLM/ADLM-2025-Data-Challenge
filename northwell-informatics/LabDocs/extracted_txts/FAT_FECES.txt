Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Fecal Fat Testing
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to outline the steps necessary for
the analytical phase of generating fecal fat results in a clinical
laboratory. The fecal fat test is used to measure the amount of fat
contained in a stool sample, which can help diagnose various
gastrointestinal disorders.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of laboratory personnel to perform the fecal fat
test according to this SOP, ensure quality control and accurate
documentation, troubleshoot any analytical issues, and report results
appropriately.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/acceptable:
• A stool sample collected in a clean, dry, and leak-proof container.
• Specimens should ideally be collected over a 24-72-hour period
to obtain a sufficient sample.
• Specimens must be stored at 2-8°C and transported to the
laboratory within 24 hours of collection.
Unacceptable:
• Specimens contaminated with urine or water.
• Specimens arriving in the laboratory later than 24 hours after
collection.
• Specimens without collection date/time indicated on the container
or requisition.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Analytical balance
• Centrifuge
• Refrigerated centrifuge
• Water bath
• Heating block
• Desiccator
• Fume hood
Reagents:
• Ethanol
• Diethyl Ether
• Sodium Hydroxide (NaOH)
• Sulfuric Acid (H2SO4)
• Petroleum ether
• Sodium sulfate (anhydrous)
Supplies:
• Glass beakers
• Measuring cylinders
• Glass rod stirrers
• Filter papers
• Evaporating dishes
• Forceps
• Porcelain dishes
5. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation of Samples
1. Mix the stool sample thoroughly using a glass rod stirrer.
2. Weigh an aliquot of the stool sample (approx. 5 grams)
accurately on an analytical balance.
B) Extraction of Fat
1. Transfer the weighed sample into a glass beaker.
2. Add 50 mL of ethanol and stir to homogenize.
3. Place the beaker in a water bath maintained at 80°C for 10
minutes.
4. Remove the beaker and add 50 mL of diethyl ether.
5. Stir the mixture gently and allow it to stand at room temperature
for 5 minutes.
6. Filter the mixture through filter paper into a clean evaporating
dish.
C) Evaporation and Weighing
1. Place the evaporating dish in a fume hood to evaporate the
solvents until dry.
2. Once dry, weigh the dish containing the residue (fat) accurately.
D) Calculation of Fat Content
1. Calculate the fat content by subtracting the tare weight of the
evaporating dish from the weight of the dish containing the
residue. Record the value in grams.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
Material:
• Use commercial fecal fat control samples with known fat content.
• Perform quality control checks with each batch of samples
processed.
Storage:
• Control samples should be stored at 2-8°C, and aliquots should
be brought to room temperature before use.
Frequency:
• Run control samples at the beginning of each testing day and
after every 20 patient samples.
Procedure:
• Process control samples alongside patient specimens following
the same extraction and weighing procedures.
• Record control sample results and compare against known values
to ensure accuracy.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
Refer to site specific reporting guidelines for result entry and
verification:
• Results are documented and reviewed in the LIS.
• Notify the ordering physician of critical fat levels as per laboratory
standard protocol.
8. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Normal fecal fat content:
• Adults: ≤ 7 grams per 24 hours
• Children: ≤ 5 grams per 24 hours
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Limitations of the fecal fat test include potential interference due to
improper sample collection, contamination, or variation in patient
stool consistency.

Refer to the individual reagent manufacturer inserts for detailed
procedural information pertaining to reagent handling and limitations.
By adhering to the steps outlined above, quality and consistency in
fecal fat testing can be achieved. This SOP is to be reviewed
annually or updated as necessary to reflect changes in laboratory
protocols or diagnostic criteria.
