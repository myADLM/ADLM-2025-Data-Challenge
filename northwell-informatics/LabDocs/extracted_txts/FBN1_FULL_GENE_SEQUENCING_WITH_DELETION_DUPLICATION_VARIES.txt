FBN1 Full Gene Sequencing with Deletion/Duplication Analysis
Protocol
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this protocol is to provide a detailed standard
operating procedure (SOP) for the analytical phase of generating
results for FBN1 full gene sequencing with deletion/duplication
analysis. FBN1 sequencing is used to identify pathogenic mutations
associated with Marfan syndrome and other related connective tissue
disorders.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of designated laboratory personnel to perform
this protocol accurately and efficiently. All personnel are required to
be trained and proficient in molecular genetics techniques and to
ensure compliance with all relevant laboratory standards and
guidelines.
3. DEFINITIONS
• FBN1: The gene encoding fibrillin-1, mutations of which are
associated with Marfan syndrome.
• Full Gene Sequencing: A method used to determine the
sequence of the entire coding region of the FBN1 gene.
• Deletion/Duplication Analysis: A technique to detect large-scale
deletions or duplications within the FBN1 gene.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Thermocycler
• DNA extraction kit
• PCR reagents
• FBN1-specific primers
• DNA sequencing platform (e.g., Sanger sequencer or Next
Generation Sequencing)
• Software for data analysis
• Qubit fluorometer
• Magnetic bead-based purification system
• Gel Electrophoresis system
• Multi-channel pipettes, sterile tips, and tubes
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred/acceptable sample: 2-5 mL of whole blood collected in
an EDTA tube. Extract genomic DNA using a standard genomic
DNA extraction kit.
• Unacceptable sample: Hemolyzed blood samples, insufficient
volume, or specimens not stored/transported under proper
conditions.
6. PROCEDURE
A. DNA Extraction
1. Extract genomic DNA from whole blood samples using a DNA
extraction kit according to the manufacturer's instructions.
2. Quantify the DNA using a Qubit fluorometer, ensuring the DNA
concentration is within the acceptable range (typically 10-50 ng/
μL).
3. Check the quality of DNA by running an aliquot on an agarose
gel.
B. PCR Amplification
1. Design and order primers specific to the exonic and intronic
boundaries of the FBN1 gene.
2. Set up PCR reactions for each amplicon:
◦ Negative control: No template DNA
◦ Positive control: Known FBN1 containing sample
3. Perform PCR amplification under the following cycling
conditions (adjust as necessary for optimized primer pairs):
◦ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 10 minutes
◦ 30-35 cycles of:
▪ Denaturation: 95°C for 30 seconds
▪ Annealing: 55-60°C for 30 seconds
▪ Extension: 72°C for 1 minute per kb
◦ Final extension: 72°C for 10 minutes
4. Check PCR products using agarose gel electrophoresis.
C. DNA Sequencing
1. Purify PCR products using a magnetic bead-based purification
system.
2. Perform DNA sequencing using a Sanger sequencing platform
or Next Generation Sequencing (NGS):
◦ Sanger sequencing: Sequence each amplicon in both
forward and reverse directions.
◦ NGS: Prepare sequencing libraries as per the NGS platform
protocol and proceed with sequencing.
3. Analyze the sequencing reads using appropriate software to
align and identify variants.
D. Deletion/Duplication Analysis
1. Perform multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification
(MLPA) or a comparable method to detect large deletions or
duplications within the FBN1 gene.
2. Follow manufacturer’s instructions and analyze the data using
designated software.
E. Data Analysis and Interpretation
1. Use bioinformatics tools to annotate variants identified in the
sequencing and deletion/duplication analysis.
2. Interpret the significance of identified variants in the context of
clinical relevance following ACMG guidelines.
3. Verify variants by reviewing raw sequencing data and using a
secondary method if necessary.
F. Quality Control
1. Perform routine control checks including:
◦ Positive and negative controls included in every batch run.
◦ Regular validation of sequencing equipment.
◦ Monthly intra-laboratory sample comparisons.
◦ Annual proficiency testing.
2. Record all control results in the Quality Control log.
G. Reporting Results
1. Review and verify results by a certified molecular geneticist.
2. Report results in the LIS with detailed interpretation.
3. Contact ordering physician if results include potentially
pathogenic findings.

8. RECORDS AND DOCUMENTATION
Maintain accurate records of all procedures, observations, results,
and quality control activities in a designated laboratory notebook or
electronic system.
9. SAFETY AND COMPLIANCE
Follow all laboratory safety protocols including wearing appropriate
personal protective equipment (PPE) and adherence to waste
disposal regulations.
This SOP should be reviewed annually and updated as necessary to
ensure compliance with best practices and technological
advancements.
