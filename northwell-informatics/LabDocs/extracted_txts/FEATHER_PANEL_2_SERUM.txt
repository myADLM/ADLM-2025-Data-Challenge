1. PURPOSE:
The purpose of this Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is to
outline the procedural steps for processing and generating results for
FEATHER PANEL # 2, SERUM tests in accordance with established
laboratory protocols and quality standards.
2. SCOPE:
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel involved in the analytical
phase of the FEATHER PANEL # 2, SERUM tests.
3. RESPONSIBILITY:
It is the responsibility of all laboratory personnel to adhere to this
protocol to ensure consistent and accurate testing results.
Designated staff members are responsible for monitoring and
verifying all procedural steps.
4. DEFINITION:
FEATHER PANEL # 2, SERUM includes a series of specified tests to
measure the levels of various substances within a serum sample.
The exact components of this panel will be defined as specified by
the laboratory.
5. PROCEDURE:
Equipment and Reagents:
1. Automated Immunoassay Analyzer (e.g., IMMUNEX 5000)
2. Calibrators and controls specific for FEATHER PANEL # 2
3. Micropipettes and pipette tips
4. Serum collection tubes
5. Disposable gloves and lab coats
6. Reagent-grade distilled water
Specimen Requirements:
1. Serum sample: Collect blood in a serum separator tube (SST)
and allow it to clot adequately.
2. Centrifuge the sample at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes to separate
the serum.
3. Store the serum samples at 2-8°C if analyzed within 24 hours,
or at -20°C for longer storage.
Sample Acceptance Criteria:
1. Samples must be properly labeled with patient information and
collection date.
2. Samples must be free from hemolysis, icterus, and lipemia.
Testing Procedure:
1. Preparation: a. Wear personal protective equipment. b. Ensure
all reagents, controls, and serum samples are at room
temperature. c. Turn on the Automated Immunoassay Analyzer
and run a system check as per the manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Calibration: a. Load the appropriate calibrators for FEATHER
PANEL # 2. b. Follow the analyzer instructions to perform
calibration. c. Ensure calibration results are within acceptable
ranges before proceeding.
3. Quality Control: a. Load the quality control materials (both low
and high level). b. Run the quality control tests and verify that
results fall within the specified ranges. c. Document the QC
results in the Quality Control Log.
4. Sample Loading: a. Place the serum samples on the sample
rack. b. Program the analyzer for the FEATHER PANEL # 2
tests according to the manufacturer’s instructions. c. Verify that
all sample information is correctly entered into the analyzer’s
software.
5. Assay Execution: a. Initiate the test run on the analyzer. b.
Monitor the analyzer throughout the testing process to ensure
there are no interruptions or errors.
6. Result Generation: a. Upon completion of the assay, review
the results on the analyzer. b. Validate the results against
quality control and calibration data. c. Transfer the results into
the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
6. TROUBLESHOOTING:
1. If quality control results are out of range: a. Repeat the
quality control tests. b. If QC remains out of range, recalibrate
the analyzer and retest the quality control. c. If the problem
persists, refer to the troubleshooting guide provided by the
analyzer’s manufacturer.
2. If analyzer malfunctions: a. Refer to the maintenance and
troubleshooting section of the analyzer’s manual. b. Consult
technical support if the issue cannot be resolved in-house. c.
Document any problems and corrective actions taken.
7. DOCUMENTATION:
1. Record all calibration, quality control, and patient test results
accurately in the corresponding logs.
2. Document any troubleshooting and corrective actions taken
during the testing process.
8. REPORTING RESULTS:
1. Verify all results in the LIS.
2. Ensure that critical values are communicated immediately to
the appropriate clinical personnel following reporting guidelines.
3. Review and electronically sign off on all results before releasing
them to the patient’s medical record.
9. MAINTENANCE AND STORAGE:
1. Clean and maintain the analyzer as per the manufacturer's
recommendations.
2. Ensure that all reagents and quality controls are stored at
appropriate conditions.
3. Dispose of all biohazardous materials in accordance with safety
regulations.
