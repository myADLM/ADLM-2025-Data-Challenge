Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Analytical Phase for
Generating Results of Fecal Leukocytes
1. PURPOSE
This procedure outlines the steps for the analytical phase of detecting
and reporting fecal leukocytes. Fecal leukocytes are white blood cells
present in stool and are an indicator of intestinal inflammation, which
can be associated with infection or other gastrointestinal disorders.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all personnel performing fecal leukocyte analysis
in the laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Designated laboratory staff is responsible for performing the
analysis and documenting the results.
• The supervising technologist is responsible for quality control,
validation, and necessary corrective actions.
4. SPECIMEN
• Preferred specimen: Fresh stool sample transported to the
laboratory within 1 hour of collection.
• Acceptable specimen: Stool sample preserved in an appropriate
transport medium, received within 24 hours of collection.
• Unacceptable specimen: Stool samples that are dry, old (more
than 24 hours if not transported in appropriate medium), or
contaminated with urine or other substances.
5. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Light Microscope
• Glass slides and coverslips
• Staining solutions (Lugol’s Iodine or methylene blue)
• Applicator sticks or swabs
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
6. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation:
1. Label the glass slide with the patient's identification details.
2. Using an applicator stick or swab, collect a small amount of
stool sample (approximately the size of a pea).
3. Smear the collected stool thinly and evenly onto the glass slide.
4. Allow the slide to air dry completely.
B. Staining:
1. Place a few drops of Lugol's Iodine or methylene blue onto the
prepared smear.
2. Let the stain react with the specimen for 1-2 minutes.
3. Gently place a coverslip over the stained area, avoiding the
formation of air bubbles.
C. Microscopic Examination:
1. Place the slide on the microscope stage.
2. Examine the stained smear under the microscope using a 40x
objective lens.
3. Identify and count the number of leukocytes per high power
field (HPF). Fecal leukocytes appear as dark, granular cells
with a distinct nucleus.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform a positive and negative control slide preparation with
known leukocyte content daily.
• Document control results in the quality control log.
• Repeat analysis if controls do not meet acceptable criteria or if
smear preparation was inadequate.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Record the number of leukocytes observed per HPF.
• Interpret the results based on the following criteria:
◦ Negative: 0-1 leukocytes/HPF
◦ Low Positive: 2-5 leukocytes/HPF
◦ Positive: >5 leukocytes/HPF
• Document the findings in the laboratory information system (LIS)
according to site-specific guidelines.
• Any deviations or notable findings should be brought to the
attention of the supervising technologist.
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• The presence of mucus, food particles, or other artifacts can
interfere with leukocyte identification.
• Leukocyte destruction during stool transport or improper staining
can lead to false-negative results.
• Results should be interpreted in conjunction with clinical
evaluation and other laboratory findings.

11. REVIEW AND DOCUMENTATION
• This SOP should be reviewed annually or whenever necessary by
the laboratory supervisor.
• Document any changes or updates in the SOP log.
