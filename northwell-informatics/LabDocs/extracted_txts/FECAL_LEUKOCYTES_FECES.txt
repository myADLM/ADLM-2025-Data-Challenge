Standard Operating Procedure: Fecal Leukocytes Analysis
1. PURPOSE To provide a standardized protocol for the detection
and enumeration of leukocytes in feces using microscopy, to assist in
the diagnosis of inflammatory conditions such as infections or
inflammatory bowel disease.
2. REFERENCE MATERIAL INCHEM Inc., Leukocyte Testing in
Feces: Protocol and Procedures
3. SCOPE This procedure applies to fecal samples submitted to the
laboratory for leukocyte analysis.
4. MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT
• Microscopy slides and coverslips
• Methylene blue stain or Malachite green stain
• Microscope (light or phase contrast)
• Applicators: wooden sticks or disposable inoculating loops
• Gloves and personal protective equipment (PPE)
• Biohazard disposal containers
• Fecal samples (received in sterile containers)
5. PROCEDURE
5.1 Specimen Requirements and Preparation:
• Fecal specimen must be freshly collected in a sterile container
and received within 24 hours of collection. If a delay is
unavoidable, the sample should be refrigerated at 2-8°C but not
frozen.
• Minimum required volume: 5 grams of fecal matter.
• Check specimen requisition form and the specimen container
label for patient's identification and collection date/time. Reject
specimens without proper identification or if past the stability time
frame.
5.2 Slide Preparation:
1. Wear appropriate PPE, including gloves.
2. Label a clean slide with the patient ID.
3. Place a small amount of feces (approximately the size of a pea,
1-2 grams) in a disposable container.
4. Add 1-2 drops of methylene blue (or Malachite green) directly
onto the fecal sample.
5. Mix the feces and stain thoroughly using a wooden stick or
inoculating loop.
6. Place a small drop of the stained sample onto the labeled slide.
7. Apply a coverslip over the smear.
5.3 Microscopic Examination:
1. Allow the prepared slide to stand for 1-2 minutes to wash out
unwanted coloring agents and ensure proper staining.
2. Utilize a light microscope starting with low power (10x) to locate
a suitable examination area and then switch to high power
(40x) for detailed observation.
3. Examine multiple fields systematically to ensure thorough
representation of the sample.
5.4 Evaluation and Results Recording:
• Report the presence of leukocytes per high-power field (HPF) as:
◦ Negative: No leukocytes observed
◦ Rare: 1-5 leukocytes per HPF
◦ Occasional: 6-10 leukocytes per HPF
◦ Moderate: 11-25 leukocytes per HPF
◦ Numerous: More than 25 leukocytes per HPF
• Record the findings in the laboratory information system (LIS),
including patient ID, date, time, analyst initials, and leukocyte
count.
5.5 Quality Control:
• Use known positive and negative stool samples as part of daily
QC procedures.
• Ensure reagents and stain are within expiry and stored correctly
according to manufacturer guidelines.
• Document QC activities in the QC log.
5.6 Reporting Results:
• Verify results in the LIS before final release.
• Critical Findings: Notify the ordering physician immediately if
numerous leukocytes are observed, indicating potential severe
infection or inflammatory disease.
6. SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS
• Handle all fecal specimens as potentially infectious materials
using standard precautions.
• Dispose of all waste materials (e.g., sticks, loops, slides)
appropriately in biohazardous waste containers.
• Decontaminate workspace and equipment after use.
