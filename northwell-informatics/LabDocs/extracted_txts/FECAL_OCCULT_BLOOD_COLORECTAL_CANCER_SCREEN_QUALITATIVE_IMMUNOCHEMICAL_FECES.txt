Fecal Occult Blood, Colorectal Cancer
Screen, Qualitative, Immunochemical,
Feces SOP
1. Purpose
The purpose of this protocol is to outline the procedures for the
qualitative detection of occult blood in feces using immunochemical
methods, which are used for colorectal cancer screening.
2. Scope
This SOP applies to the analytical phase of testing for fecal occult
blood using an immunochemical method in a CLIA-certified
laboratory.
3. Responsibility
• Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the
test, maintaining equipment, and ensuring quality control
procedures are followed.
• Supervisors are responsible for reviewing results, ensuring
compliance with this SOP, and addressing any issues that arise.
4. Specimen Requirements
Acceptable Specimens:
• Stool samples collected in a clean, dry container free from toilet
water or urine contamination.
• Follow instrument-specific or manufacturer’s guidelines for
collection container and stability conditions.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens contaminated with foreign substances (e.g. toilet
water, urine).
• Specimens not properly labeled.
• Specimens outside the stability window indicated by the
manufacturer.
5. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies
• Immunochemical Fecal Occult Blood Test (iFOBT) kit.
• Appropriate collection devices and buffer solutions as provided by
the manufacturer.
• Timer.
• Quality control materials (positive and negative controls).
6. Procedure
A. Preparation
1. Ensure all equipment is calibrated and functioning properly.
2. Review the specifics of the test kit insert provided by the
manufacturer.
3. Verify expiration dates on test kits and reagents, and do not use
any components past their expiration date.
B. Specimen Handling
1. Immediately upon receipt, verify specimen information including
patient ID and collection time.
2. Store specimens as required if testing is not performed
immediately (typically refrigerated).
C. Testing
1. Perform a visual inspection of the specimen for any signs of
contamination.
2. Following manufacturer’s instructions, prepare the specimen for
testing. Typically, this involves:
◦ Adding a specified quantity of stool sample to a collection
buffer tube.
◦ Mixing the sample thoroughly.
3. Apply the sample to the test cartridge or strip as per the
manufacturer’s guidelines.
4. Start the timer as soon as the specimen has been applied.
5. Incubate for the time specified, ensuring the test is carried out
at room temperature unless otherwise specified by the
manufacturer.
D. Reading Results
1. Read test results within the time window specified by the
manufacturer.
2. Compare the test line intensity with the control line according to
the guidelines provided.
3. Record results as Positive, Negative, or Invalid. An invalid result
generally indicates a test error and necessitates repeat testing.
E. Quality Control
1. Run positive and negative quality controls with each batch of
tests, every new shipment of tests, and when opening a new kit
lot.
2. Record QC results. Testing should not proceed if control results
are out of range.
3. Troubleshoot and rectify any issues indicated by QC failure
prior to patient testing.
7. Reporting Results
1. Enter test results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
2. Ensure results that are positive are flagged for follow-up testing
and communicated appropriately following laboratory reporting
guidelines.
3. Document any deviations or issues encountered during testing
and their resolution.
8. Reference Intervals
• Positive Result: Indication of occult blood present.
• Negative Result: No detectable occult blood.
• Invalid Result: Test error, repeat test necessary.
9. Method Limitations
• Certain medications and dietary factors might impact test results;
refer to the manufacturer’s instructions for detailed information.
• The test should not be used as a definitive diagnosis but as a
screening tool. Positive results should prompt follow-up with
further diagnostic procedures.
10. References
• Manufacturer’s instructions for the specific immunochemical fecal
occult blood test used.
• CLIA guidelines for laboratory testing and quality control.
• Internal laboratory policies and procedures documentation.
By adhering to this protocol, accuracy, consistency, and reliability in
fecal occult blood testing can be ensured, supporting effective
colorectal cancer screening programs.
