Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Felbamate (Felbatol) Testing, Serum
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this SOP is to outline the
procedures for the analytical phase of testing Felbamate
(Felbatol) levels in serum specimens. This ensures accurate
and precise results, which are critical for therapeutic drug
monitoring and ensuring patient safety.
Responsibility: It is the responsibility of laboratory personnel to
adhere to this SOP, ensuring the accuracy and reliability of
Felbamate (Felbatol) serum levels. Any deviations from this SOP
must be documented and communicated to the laboratory supervisor.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
◦ Preferred Specimen: Serum collected in a red-top tube (no
gel barrier).
◦ Volume: Minimum of 1 mL of serum.
◦ Specimen Storage: Specimens should be refrigerated at
2-8°C and analyzed within 7 days. If longer storage is
required, freeze at -20°C or below.
◦ Unacceptable Specimens: Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric
specimens. Specimens collected in tubes with gel barriers
are not acceptable.
2. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
◦ HPLC or LC-MS/MS system equipped with a UV detector.
◦ Felbamate standard and quality control materials.
◦ Appropriate solvents, typically acetonitrile and water (HPLC
grade).
◦ Calibration curves should be prepared using certified
reference standards.
◦ Laboratory supplies: centrifuge, pipettes, vials, and
syringes.
3. PROCEDURE A) Serum Sample Preparation
1. Centrifuge the serum sample at 3,000 rpm for 10 minutes
to separate the serum from cellular components.
2. Aliquot 0.5 mL of the clear serum into a clean vial.
3. Add 1.0 mL of acetonitrile to the serum aliquot to
precipitate proteins.
4. Vortex the mixture for 1 minute.
5. Centrifuge the sample at 10,000 rpm for 10 minutes.
6. Transfer the supernatant to a new vial for analysis, being
careful not to disturb the precipitate.
B) HPLC or LC-MS/MS Analysis
1. Prepare the HPLC or LC-MS/MS system according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Equilibrate the column with the mobile phase (typically 70%
acetonitrile and 30% water) at a flow rate of 1 mL/min.
3. Inject 10 µL of the prepared serum sample into the HPLC or
LC-MS/MS system.
4. Monitor the effluent at the appropriate wavelength for
Felbamate (typically 235 nm).
5. Analyze the sample for Felbamate with a retention time of
approximately 7-10 minutes (may vary based on the column
and mobile phase used).
C) Calibration and Quality Control
1. Prepare a calibration curve using a set of Felbamate standards
of known concentrations.
2. Include quality control samples (low, medium, and high
concentrations) in each run.
3. Ensure the calibration curve is linear (R²>0.995).
4. Assess the accuracy and precision of quality control samples.
Accuracy should be within ±10% of the nominal value, and
precision should have a coefficient of variation (CV) of less than
15%.
5. INTERPRETING RESULTS
◦ The concentration of Felbamate in the patient’s serum is
calculated by comparing the sample peak area with the
calibration curve.
◦ Report results in µg/mL.
◦ Critical values are communicated to the appropriate clinician
immediately.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Run quality control samples at the beginning and end of
each batch to ensure the system's accuracy throughout the
run.
◦ Document all results and any corrective actions taken.
◦ Regularly review and document the calibration and
maintenance of the equipment.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
after reviewing and verifying the data.
◦ Results should be reported to the clinician within 24 hours of
specimen receipt.
8. TROUBLESHOOTING AND MAINTENANCE
◦ Regularly maintain the HPLC or LC-MS/MS system
according to the manufacturer’s guidelines.
◦ If issues arise, refer to the troubleshooting section in the
manufacturer’s manual or contact technical support.
◦ Document any maintenance or troubleshooting activities.
9. REFERENCES
◦ Manufacturer’s operating manuals for HPLC or LC-MS/MS
system.
◦ Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI)
guidelines for therapeutic drug monitoring.
10. DOCUMENT APPROVAL
• This SOP must be reviewed and approved by the laboratory
supervisor and documented in the SOP manual.
This protocol ensures that Felbamate (Felbatol) serum levels are
determined accurately and precisely, aligning with industry standards
and ensuring patient safety.
By following these detailed steps, laboratory personnel ensure the
accuracy, integrity, and reliability of the test results, ultimately
contributing to effective patient care and therapeutic monitoring.
