STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE: FENTANYL SCREEN,
RANDOM, URINE
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized protocol for the analytical phase of
generating results for Fentanyl Screen, Random, Urine to ensure
accuracy, reliability, and reproducibility of test results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
The designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the
analysis according to this SOP. All personnel must adhere to quality
control measures and report any deficiencies to a supervisor.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type:
• Random urine specimen.
Specimen Volume:
• Minimum volume: 10 mL.
Specimen Handling:
• Specimen should be sent to the laboratory within 24 hours of
collection.
• Refrigerate specimen if there is a delay in transportation to the
laboratory.
• Specimens arriving without proper labeling or beyond the
acceptable duration will be considered unacceptable.
4. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Fentanyl-specific immunoassay kits.
• Urine collection containers.
• Pipettes and tips.
• Tube racks.
• Sample analysis instrument (e.g., AU680 Chemistry Analyzer or
equivalent).
5. PROCEDURE
Preliminary Steps:
1. Verify specimen integrity upon receipt (e.g., proper labeling,
sufficient volume, no contamination).
2. Accession the specimen into the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
Analysis Steps:
1. Prepare reagents and calibrators as per manufacturer’s
instructions.
◦ Ensure reagents are within their expiry dates and stored
correctly.
2. Mix the urine specimen well by gently inverting the container
several times.
3. Pipette the required volume of urine specimen into the sample
cup.
4. Load the sample cup onto the analyzer.
5. Initiate the Fentanyl screen on the analyzer by selecting the
appropriate test code.
6. Allow the analyzer to run the test cycle and await results.
Result Interpretation:
1. The analyzer will provide a result of either negative or
presumptive positive.
2. For presumptive positive results, further confirmatory testing
(e.g., LC-MS/MS) may be required to verify results.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform QC tests daily using both positive and negative control
materials provided by the manufacturer.
• Document QC results in the QC log.
• If QC results are out of acceptable range, troubleshoot following
the manufacturer's instructions and contact the supervisor.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results are automatically transmitted to the LIS.
• Review and validate all results before final reporting.
• For critical or presumptive positive results, a second technologist
will verify the findings before reporting.
• Notify the requesting physician or nursing station following site-
specific guidelines for reporting critical values.
8. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• The reference interval for Fentanyl Screen in Random Urine is
negative (no detectable fentanyl).
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to the manufacturer’s kit insert for specific limitations
regarding interferences and assay sensitivity.
• Results may be affected by improper specimen handling or delays
in transportation.
10. DOCUMENTATION AND RECORD KEEPING
• Document all procedural steps, QC results, and corrective actions
in the designated logs.
• Maintain records for a minimum period as governed by CLIA and
local regulations.
11. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s Reagent Kit Insert.
• Laboratory’s Quality Assurance Protocol.
12. ADDITIONAL NOTES
• Be aware of any updates to safety protocols and procedures as
per laboratory guidelines.
• Always use personal protective equipment (PPE) when handling
specimens.
