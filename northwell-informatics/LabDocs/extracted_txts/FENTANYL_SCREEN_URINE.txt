Fentanyl Screen, Urine Protocol
1. Purpose: To provide a detailed protocol for the accurate and
timely analysis of urine specimens for the presence of fentanyl
using an enzyme immunoassay (EIA) method in a CLIA-
certified laboratory.
2. Specimen Requirements:
◦ Preferred/acceptable specimens:
▪ 10 mL of freshly voided urine sent to the laboratory
within 6 hours of collection.
▪ Specimens should be collected in a sterile, leak-proof
container and properly labeled with the patient's name,
collection date, and time.
◦ Unacceptable specimens:
▪ Specimens arriving in the laboratory greater than 6 hours
after collection.
▪ Specimen containers that are not properly labeled.
▪ Specimens that have been contaminated or are of
insufficient volume.
3. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies:
◦ Fentanyl Enzyme Immunoassay (EIA) kit
◦ Calibrators and controls
◦ Micropipettes and tips
◦ Specimen cups
◦ Timer
◦ Centrifuge
◦ Plate reader
4. Preparation:
◦ Ensure all necessary equipment and supplies are available
and properly calibrated.
◦ Verify the expiration dates of reagents and controls.
◦ Prepare the EIA kit according to manufacturer instructions.
◦ Ensure the laboratory temperature is within the acceptable
range (20-26°C).
5. Procedure:
1. Specimen Handling and Preparation:
▪ If the urine specimen has been refrigerated, bring it to
room temperature prior to analysis.
▪ Mix the specimen thoroughly by gentle inversion.
▪ Aliquot the required volume of urine into a clean test
tube or container.
▪ Centrifuge the urine sample at 1500-2000 RPM for 5
minutes to remove any particulate matter.
2. Assay Setup:
▪ Follow manufacturer instructions to set up the EIA
plate, including adding calibrators, controls, and
samples to designated wells.
▪ Use micropipettes to ensure accurate dispensing
volumes (typically 50-100 μL as required by the kit).
▪ Incubate the plate at room temperature or specified
incubation conditions according to the kit insert.
3. Detection:
▪ After the specified incubation period, wash the wells
according to the kit instruction.
▪ Add substrate reagent to each well and incubate for
the recommended time.
▪ Stop the reaction using the provided stop solution.
▪ Measure the absorbance at the appropriate
wavelength using a plate reader.
6. Quality Control:
◦ Run controls and calibrators simultaneously with each batch
to ensure the assay is performing within acceptable limits.
◦ Record and review control results according to laboratory
SOPs.
◦ If control values are outside the acceptable range,
investigate and resolve issues before reporting patient
results.
7. Reporting Results:
◦ Review the absorbance data and compare with calibrator
thresholds to determine the presence or absence of fentanyl
in the urine sample.
◦ Positive results for fentanyl should be reported in the
laboratory information system (LIS) promptly.
◦ Negative and inconclusive results should be verified and
reviewed before reporting.
8. Reference Intervals:
◦ Reference intervals will be provided in the EIA kit insert.
Typically, the presence of fentanyl is indicated by an
absorbance value greater than the positive threshold
defined by the calibrators.
9. Method Limitations:
◦ Cross-reactivity with other opiates or medications must be
considered. Refer to the EIA kit insert for detailed
information.
◦ Dilute or adulterated urine samples may produce false-
negative results.
10. Documentation and Record Keeping:
• Ensure all specimen handling, assay setup, and result reporting
are documented accurately.
• Maintain records of quality control results and any corrective
actions taken.
• Store patient results in compliance with laboratory and regulatory
guidelines.
1. References:
• Manufacturer's Fentanyl Enzyme Immunoassay Kit insert.
• CLIA regulation documents relevant to laboratory testing and
quality control.
By following this protocol, the laboratory ensures reliable and
accurate results for Fentanyl screening in urine specimens,
maintaining high standards of patient care and compliance with
regulatory requirements.
