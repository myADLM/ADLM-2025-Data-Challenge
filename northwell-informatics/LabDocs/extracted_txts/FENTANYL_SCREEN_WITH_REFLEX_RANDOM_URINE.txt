Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Protocol for the Analytical
Phase of Generating Results for Fentanyl Screen with Reflex,
Random, Urine
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to provide guidelines for the
analysis of urine specimens for the presence of fentanyl and its
metabolites. This SOP describes the operational steps required to
perform fentanyl screening, and specify reflex testing steps if the
initial screen is positive.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel trained in urine
drug screening and confirmation tests, and who have demonstrated
competency in performing and documenting such analyses.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all laboratory staff to follow this SOP and
ensure accurate and timely reporting of results. Any deviations or
issues must be documented and reported to a supervisor.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Random urine
• Volume: Minimum 10 mL
• Stability: Freshly collected urine must be refrigerated if testing is
delayed beyond 2 hours. Maintain at 2-8°C and test within 24
hours. If longer storage is required, freeze at -20°C or colder.
• Unacceptable Conditions: Insufficient volume, specimens with
preservatives, specimens that are excessively diluted or
contaminated.
5. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Automated immunoassay analyzer for initial screen
• Reagents: Fentanyl drug screening reagent kit
• LC-MS/MS system for confirmatory reflex testing
• Reference standards and controls (QC materials)
• Calibrators specific for fentanyl and its metabolites
• Required glassware, urine collection containers, and PPE
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run positive and negative controls with each batch of specimens.
• Controls should be within acceptable ranges before releasing any
patient results.
• Verify instrument calibration with appropriate standards before
use.
7. PROCEDURE: FENTANYL SCREEN
1. Pre-Analytical Checks
◦ Ensure the specimen meets the acceptance criteria.
◦ Record sample identification and relevant information.
2. Screening Process (Immunoassay)
◦ Configure the immunoassay analyzer with the specific
parameter set for fentanyl.
◦ Load specimens, calibrators, and QC materials as per
analyzer instructions.
◦ Initiate the screening run. The analyzer will automatically
process the samples and report qualitative results (positive/
negative).
3. Review of Screening Results
◦ Verify that control samples provide expected results.
◦ Document and review the screening results.
8. PROCEDURE: REFLEX TESTING (LC-MS/MS
CONFIRMATORY)
1. Criteria for Reflex Testing
◦ Reflex testing will be performed automatically on any
specimen yielding a positive initial screening result.
2. Sample Preparation for LC-MS/MS
◦ Aliquot 1-2 mL of the positive urine sample.
◦ Prepare the sample according to the protocols for LC-MS/
MS analysis, including any necessary hydrolysis, extraction,
and purification steps.
◦ Prepare and run appropriate controls and standards
concurrently.
3. Analytical Procedure
◦ Load the samples, calibrators, and controls into the LC-MS/
MS system.
◦ Use the specified method for fentanyl analysis, documenting
all parameters (such as retention time, ion transitions).
◦ Run the analysis following the manufacturer’s guidelines for
both the instrument and the reagents.
4. Review of Reflex Testing Results
◦ Inspect chromatograms and mass spectra for the correct
identification and quantification of fentanyl and its
metabolites.
◦ Compare the results with the expected retention times and
mass fragments of the standards and controls.
5. Documentation and Interpretation
◦ Ensure all reflex test results are within quality control
parameters.
◦ Interpret results according to cutoff values: results above the
threshold are positive for fentanyl presence; below the
threshold or non-detected in confirmatory tests are regarded
as negative.
◦ Document results in the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
9. REPORTING RESULTS
• Positive Screen Confirmation: Results are released in the LIS
upon completing both the initial screen and the confirmatory test.
For positive results, include the concentration of fentanyl and
metabolites identified.
• Negative Screen: Only the screening result is reported as
negative.
• Critical Results: Immediately notify the ordering physician or
relevant healthcare provider if the confirmatory test results are
positive.
10. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Urine sample integrity must be maintained as improper storage
conditions can degrade the analytes.
• Cross-reactivity: Be aware of potential cross-reactivity with other
substances. Cross-reacting substances should be evaluated to
ensure that they do not interfere with the results.
