Protocol for the Analytical Phase of Generating Results for
Fentanyl, Serum
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the analysis of fentanyl in
serum specimens using liquid chromatography-tandem mass
spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to ensure accurate and reliable results.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all qualified laboratory personnel to adhere to
this protocol during the analysis of serum specimens for fentanyl. It is
also the responsibility of the supervising staff to ensure that all
personnel are adequately trained and competent in performing the
analysis, as well as to verify the quality of the results.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred specimen: Serum collected in a red-top tube or a
serum separator tube (SST).
• Specimen stability: Collected serum should be immediately
separated by centrifugation, removed from the clot, and stored at
2-8°C. If analysis is not performed within 24 hours, it should be
aliquoted and stored at -20°C or colder.
• Unacceptable specimens: Hemolyzed, lipemic, and icteric
samples; specimens collected in tubes containing anticoagulants.
1. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
• LC-MS/MS system, including HPLC system and tandem mass
spectrometer.
• Analytical balance.
• Centrifuge.
• Micropipettes and pipette tips.
• Vortex mixer.
• Sample preparation supplies (e.g., solid-phase extraction
cartridges).
• High purity reagents and solvents.
• Certified Fentanyl standard and internal standard.
1. REAGENTS
• Mobile phase solvents (e.g., water, acetonitrile, formic acid).
• Fentanyl standard solution.
• Internal standard solution (e.g., deuterated fentanyl).
• Extraction solvents.
• Calibration standards.
• Quality control materials.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Calibration and Quality Control
1. Prepare calibration standards and quality control (QC) samples
according to laboratory guidelines.
2. Run calibration standards to establish a calibration curve on the
LC-MS/MS system.
3. Analyze QC samples to verify calibration accuracy and system
performance.
B. Sample Preparation
1. Thaw serum specimens, if frozen, and allow them to reach
room temperature while protected from light.
2. Vortex the samples briefly to ensure homogeneity.
3. Pipette an appropriate volume of serum (typically 0.5 mL) into a
clean extraction tube.
4. Add an internal standard to each specimen.
5. Perform protein precipitation or extraction based on the chosen
method (e.g., solid-phase extraction).
6. Centrifuge the samples to remove particulates and transfer the
supernatant to clean injection vials.
7. Evaporate the solvent under a stream of nitrogen if necessary,
and reconstitute the residue in an appropriate solvent.
C. Instrumental Analysis
1. Check and calibrate the LC-MS/MS system, ensuring it is in
proper working condition.
2. Set up the LC-MS/MS method for fentanyl detection, including
parameters such as LC gradient, flow rate, and mass
spectrometer settings.
3. Load prepared samples, calibration standards, and QC
samples into the autosampler.
4. Initiate the analysis run sequence.
5. Monitor the system throughout the analysis to ensure proper
function.
D. Data Analysis and Reporting
1. Process the raw data using the LC-MS/MS software to
generate ion chromatograms for fentanyl and internal standard.
2. Verify the retention time, peak shape, and signal-to-noise ratio
for all standards and samples.
3. Quantify fentanyl concentrations in the serum specimens using
the calibration curve.
4. Ensure all QC sample results are within established acceptance
criteria.
5. Review and validate the final results.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
Run QC samples at the beginning and end of each batch and after
every 20 samples to verify instrument performance and accuracy.
Check the performance of the LC-MS/MS system regularly by
running calibration standards and QC samples.
Maintain detailed records of all calibration, QC, and sample results.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Report fentanyl concentration in nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL).
Refer to relevant clinical guidelines and toxicological reference
materials for interpretation of fentanyl levels.
1. RESULT REPORTING
Results should be reported according to laboratory guidelines,
indicating the concentration of fentanyl in the serum.
Any critical findings should be communicated to the requesting
clinician promptly, as per standard protocols.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the LC-MS/MS system manual and reagent manufacturer's
guidelines for any limitations related to the detection and
quantification of fentanyl in serum.
Avoid interferences from other substances that might be present in
the serum.
