Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Fentanyl with Metabolite Confirmation,
Chain of Custody, Random, Urine
1. PURPOSE This SOP outlines the procedure for handling,
analyzing, and reporting results for Fentanyl with Metabolite
Confirmation in urine samples under Chain of Custody protocols. This
process ensures the integrity, accuracy, and reliability of the test
results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY All designated laboratory personnel are
responsible for following this SOP to ensure compliance with federal
regulations and maintaining the integrity of the Chain of Custody
protocol.
3. DEFINITION
• Chain of Custody: Refers to the documentation of the control,
transfer, and analysis of the sample to maintain security.
• Fentanyl: A potent synthetic opioid, often included in substance
abuse testing panels.
• Metabolite: Biotransformed products of fentanyl, such as
norfentanyl.
• Random: Refers to samples collected randomly without prior
notice to the donor.
4. PROCEDURE
4.1 Sample Receipt and Accessioning
• Verify that the urine specimen container is sealed and labeled
according to Chain of Custody standards.
• Review accompanying Chain of Custody documentation for
completeness.
• Log the sample into the Laboratory Information System (LIS) and
assign a unique laboratory accession number.
4.2 Specimen Preparation
• Inspect sample for tampering, and integrity, and ensure sufficient
volume (minimum 30 mL).
• Mix specimen thoroughly to ensure homogeneity.
• Aliquot 5 mL of urine from the original container into a secondary
labeled container.
4.3 Initial Immunoassay Screening
• Use an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or
equivalent method to screen for fentanyl and its metabolites.
• Calibrate the immunoassay analyzer daily with quality control
(QC) materials and document results.
4.4 Confirmation by Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry
(GC-MS) or Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry
(LC-MS/MS)
• Prepare the calibration curve using Fentanyl and norfentanyl
reference standards.
• Perform rigorous QC checks using negative, low positive, and
high positive QC samples.
• Extract 1 mL aliquots of urine using solid-phase extraction (SPE)
methods or equivalent, optimized for fentanyl and its metabolites.
• Reconstitute dried extracts in the appropriate solvent and inject
them into the chromatographic system.
4.5 Data Analysis
• Analyze chromatograms to identify fentanyl and metabolites using
retention time and mass spectral data.
• Compare sample peaks with reference standards for confirmation.
• Quantitate concentrations of fentanyl and its metabolites by
comparing peak areas to the calibration curve.
4.6 Result Interpretation
• Results are to be considered positive if fentanyl or norfentanyl is
detected above the established cutoff level.
• Confirmatory test results take precedence over initial screen
results.
4.7 Reporting
• Enter validated results into the LIS.
• Double-check all manual entries to ensure accuracy.
• Include the Chain of Custody documentation with the final report.
• Release results to the authorized requesting party in a secure,
confidential manner.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
5.1 Internal QC
• Run negative and positive controls with each batch of specimens.
• Perform instrument maintenance and calibration according to the
manufacturer's guidelines.
• Document and address any QC deviations immediately.
5.2 External Proficiency Testing
• Participate in an external proficiency testing program specific to
fentanyl and metabolites in urine.
6. SAFETY AND COMPLIANCE
• Follow all safety guidelines for handling biological specimens.
• Ensure proper disposal of waste materials according to the
laboratory's biohazard protocols.
• Comply with regulatory guidelines including CLIA, CAP, and
SAMHSA for substance abuse testing.

8. DOCUMENTATION
• Maintain all records including sample accessioning logs, QC logs,
calibration charts, and final reports as per the laboratory’s
document retention policy for at least five years.
