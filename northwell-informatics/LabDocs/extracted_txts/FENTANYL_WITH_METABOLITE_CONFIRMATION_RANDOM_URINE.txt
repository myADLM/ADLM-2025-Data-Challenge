Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Fentanyl with Metabolite
Confirmation, Random, Urine
Purpose
To provide a detailed procedure for the confirmation and
quantification of fentanyl and its metabolites in random urine samples
using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/
MS).
Specimen Requirements
Preferred/Acceptable:
• 10 mL random urine, collected in a sterile, labeled container.
• Urine samples should be collected using standard clean-catch
collection methods.
• Refrigerate the sample if not analyzed within 8 hours and ensure
it's analyzed within 48 hours of collection.
Unacceptable:
• Urine samples with preservatives.
• Samples contaminated with fecal matter or other substances.
Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies
• LC-MS/MS system
• Calibrated pipettes and tips
• Urine sample vials and caps
• Mobile phase A and B (refer to LC-MS/MS operational manual)
• Fentanyl and metabolite standards and internal standards
• Solid-phase extraction (SPE) cartridges
• Centrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Cryovials for storage
• Calibration and control materials
Procedure
A. Sample Preparation
1. Vortex the urine sample for 30 seconds.
2. Aliquot 1 mL of the urine into a labeled cryovial.
3. Add 100 µL of internal standard to each aliquoted sample.
4. Vortex briefly to mix.
B. Sample Extraction
1. Load the sample onto the SPE cartridge following the SPE
manufacturer’s protocol.
2. Wash the SPE cartridge with the appropriate wash solution.
3. Evaporate the eluent to dryness under a gentle stream of
nitrogen at 40°C.
4. Reconstitute the dried residue in 200 µL of mobile phase A.
C. LC-MS/MS Analysis
1. Programme the LC-MS/MS system according to the
manufacturer's instructions, including details such as column
type, mobile phases, flow rate, and gradient elution plan.
2. Inject 10 µL of the reconstituted sample into the LC-MS/MS
system.
3. Ensure system suitability by running calibration standards and
quality control (QC) samples at the beginning, middle, and end
of each batch analysis.
4. Monitor the transition ions for fentanyl and its metabolites,
ensuring retention times and signal intensities match the
calibration standards and QC specimens.
5. Record and analyze data according to the system’s software.
D. Data Analysis and Result Reporting
1. Confirm fentanyl and/or its metabolites by comparing the
sample’s retention times and spectra with those of the
standards.
2. Quantitate the concentration of fentanyl and its metabolites
using the calibration curve.
3. Internal standards should be within acceptable limits, and QC
samples should fall within the specified range to validate the
run.
Quality Control
• Process a minimum of two QC samples (one low and one high)
with every analytical batch.
• Analyze a blank sample to check for potential carryover at the
beginning and end of the sequence.
• Document all QC results in the QC log and verify that results fall
within acceptable ranges before proceeding with batch analysis.
Corrective Actions
• If QC results fall outside acceptable ranges, reanalyze the
affected samples and QC.
• If system suitability criteria are not met, halt analysis, troubleshoot
the issue per manufacturer's recommendations, and re-run initial
system suitability tests before resuming sample processing.
Reporting Results
• Results are automatically transmitted to the Laboratory
Information System (LIS) once the run is complete.
• Ensure the results are reviewed and verified by a qualified
technologist before releasing them.
• Critical values, if identified, should be reported immediately to the
relevant clinical personnel following standard laboratory protocols.
