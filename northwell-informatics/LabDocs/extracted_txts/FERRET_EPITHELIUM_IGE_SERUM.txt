Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Ferret Epithelium IgE, Serum
1. PURPOSE To provide a detailed, standardized procedure for
the analysis of serum samples for the determination of IgE
antibodies specific to ferret epithelium. This procedure ensures
accurate, reliable, and consistent results compliant with CLIA
regulations.
2. RESPONSIBILITY Trained laboratory personnel are
responsible for performing the analysis following this SOP. It is
the responsibility of each laboratory staff member to ensure that
the procedure is followed correctly and to document any
irregularities or deviations.
3. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
◦ Immunoassay analyzer (e.g., Phadia 250/350)
◦ Specific IgE test reagents and calibrators for ferret
epithelium
◦ Quality control materials
◦ Calibrated pipettes
◦ Vortex mixer
◦ Serum samples
◦ Personal protective equipment (PPE)
◦ Distilled water
◦ Centrifuge (for serum sample preparation)
◦ Timer
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
◦ Preferred Specimen: Serum
◦ Volume: Minimum 500 µL of serum
◦ Specimen Stability: Serum should be stored at 2-8°C for
up to 7 days or frozen at -20°C for longer storage.
Unacceptable Specimens:
◦ Hemolyzed samples
◦ Specimens that have been thawed and refrozen
◦ Specimens in non-serum collection tubes, e.g., plasma or
whole blood
5. PROCEDURE 5.1 Preparation: - Wear appropriate PPE (lab
coat, gloves, goggles). - Turn on the analyzer and perform the
instrument start-up procedure as per manufacturer’s guidelines.
- Verify that all reagents, calibrators, and quality control
materials are within their expiration dates and prepare them
according to manufacturer’s instructions.
5.2 Calibration: - Run calibrators for the specific IgE assay
according to the analyzer's instructions. - Ensure that the
calibration results meet the specified criteria before proceeding
with sample analysis.
5.3 Quality Control: - Analyze quality control materials at the
beginning of each run according to the lab's QC plan. - Confirm
that QC results are within the acceptable range before
analyzing patient samples. - Document QC results in the
appropriate log.
5.4 Sample Preparation: - Thaw frozen serum specimens
completely and mix gently. Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles. -
Centrifuge serum samples at 1,500 x g for 10 minutes to
remove any particulates. - Pipette the required volume of serum
into a designated sample cup for the analyzer.
5.5 Sample Analysis: - Load the sample cups onto the
specified positions in the analyzer. - Enter the sample
identification details into the analyzer system. - Select the
appropriate assay program for ferret epithelium-specific IgE. -
Start the run according to the analyzer’s standard operating
procedures.
5.6 Result Verification: - Upon completion of the run, review
the test results for any flagged issues or errors. - Verify that all
control and calibration criteria are met. - For any discrepancies
or flagged results, troubleshoot according to the analyzer’s
guidelines and rerun samples where necessary.
5.7 Reporting Results: - Report results in IU/mL as specified
by the analyzer’s output. - Enter and verify the results in the
Laboratory Information System (LIS) following the lab’s
protocol. - Ensure any critical results are communicated
immediately to the requesting physician as per the lab’s critical
result policy.
6. DOCUMENTATION All performed calibrations, quality control
results, sample identifications, and test results should be
accurately documented in the LIS and the laboratory’s record-
keeping system.
7. QUALITY ASSURANCE AND TROUBLESHOOTING
◦ Perform regular maintenance and calibration of the
equipment as recommended by the manufacturer.
◦ Investigate any irregularities in calibration or QC
performance before sample analysis continues.
◦ Document any issues, resolutions, and corrective actions
taken.
8. REFERENCE INTERVALS Refer to the analyzer’s manual or
specific kit insert for the reference range for IgE antibodies
specific to ferret epithelium.
9. LIMITATIONS Analytical limitations may include sample
hemolysis, lipemia, or icterus, which can interfere with the
assay's accuracy. Ensure such samples are either recollected
or assessed with caution.
10. REVISIONS This SOP should be reviewed annually or as
needed to include any updates in the guidelines or equipment
used. All personnel must be informed and trained on any
updates.
