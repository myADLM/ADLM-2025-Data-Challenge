STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE FOR FERRITIN
ANALYSIS
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedures for the
quantitative determination of ferritin in human serum, using the
appropriate immunoassay method. This protocol ensures accurate
and reliable results, following established laboratory practices and
ensuring compliance with regulatory guidelines.
Responsibility: All trained laboratory staff are responsible for
performing the analysis, ensuring the accuracy of results, and
maintaining the equipment used for ferritin measurement.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen Type:
• Preferred: Serum or plasma (heparinized or EDTA)
• Acceptable: SST, heparinized, or EDTA venous blood collection
tubes.
Specimen Collection:
• Ensure proper phlebotomy technique is used.
• Allow SST tubes to clot for at least 30 minutes and centrifuge
within 2 hours of collection.
• Plasma specimens should be centrifuged immediately after
collection.
Specimen Stability:
• Room Temperature: 8 hours
• Refrigerated (2-8°C): 48 hours
• Frozen (-20°C or lower): 1 month
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Grossly hemolytic, lipemic, or icteric specimens
• Specimens collected in sodium citrate or oxalate tubes.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Immunoassay analyzer (e.g., Roche Cobas, Siemens ADVIA
Centaur, Beckman Coulter Access)
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes and tips
• Sample cups or tubes
Reagents:
• Ferritin reagent kit compatible with the immunoassay analyzer.
• Calibration standards and quality control materials.
• Controls: Level 1, Level 2 (as specified by the kit insert)
Supplies:
• PPE (Personal Protective Equipment)
• Disposable gloves
• Timer
1. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
• Ensure the immunoassay analyzer is calibrated and functional.
• Check the reagent expiration date and integrity before use.
• Prepare calibration and control samples according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
Analysis:
1. Load patient serum/plasma samples into the designated
sample holder/cup.
2. Load ferritin reagent kit, calibrators, and controls into the
analyzer.
3. Program the analyzer with the specific assay parameters for
ferritin based on the manufacturer’s protocol.
4. Initiate the run and monitor the instrument.
Recording Results:
• Upon completion of the analytical run, review generated data for
calibration and control sample results.
• Ensure all quality control results are within acceptable ranges.
• Approve and verify patient results in the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
• Apply necessary comments for hemolytic, lipemic, or icteric
specimens based on the analyzer’s flag or visual inspection.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
Daily QC:
• Run at least two levels of ferritin controls with each batch of
patient samples.
• Document control results, and take corrective actions if control
values fall outside established ranges.
• Troubleshoot instrument errors or calibration issues following the
manufacturer's guidelines.
Monthly QC:
• Perform instrument maintenance as described in the equipment
manual.
• Record maintenance actions in the instrument log.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
Verification:
• Ensure all patient results are reviewed by a trained technologist
before verification.
• Flag and interpret any values outside of established reference
ranges based on the reference intervals provided by the method’s
package insert or the laboratory’s guidelines.
Reference Intervals:
• Adult Male: 30-400 ng/mL
• Adult Female: 13-150 ng/mL
Critical Values:
• Alert the appropriate clinical personnel immediately if ferritin
levels fall within critical ranges per lab policy.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the ferritin reagent kit insert for individual assay method
limitations, including potential interferences and analytical sensitivity.
1. SAFETY
• Follow standard laboratory safety protocols, including the
appropriate use of PPE.
• Dispose of all samples, reagents, and sharps in accordance with
biohazard disposal guidelines.
