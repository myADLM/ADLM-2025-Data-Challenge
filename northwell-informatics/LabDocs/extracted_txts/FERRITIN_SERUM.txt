Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for FERRITIN, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the standardized process for
generating accurate and reliable results for Ferritin levels in serum
during the analytical phase in a CLIA-certified laboratory.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory personnel will follow this procedure to ensure
the consistent and accurate measurement of Ferritin levels in serum
samples. It is the responsibility of all staff to identify any deficiencies
in the analytical process which may affect test results and bring them
to the attention of a supervisor.
Equipment:
• Chemiluminescent Microparticle Immunoassay (CMIA) analyzer
• Centrifuge
• Refrigerators and Freezers (temperature monitored)
• Traceable thermometer
• Pipettes
Reagents:
• Ferritin reagent kits
• Control materials (low, medium, high)
• Calibrators
• Sample diluents
Supplies:
• Sample tubes
• Gloves
• Lab coats
• Timer
• Logs for temperature monitoring
• Lab notebooks for recording results and observations
Specimens:
Preferred/acceptable:
• Serum obtained from a blood sample centrifuged and separated.
Ideally collected in a red-top or SST (serum separator tube) and
transported to the laboratory within 2 hours of collection.
• Samples can be refrigerated if the analysis is not performed
immediately.
Unacceptable:
• Hemolyzed samples
• Lipemic samples
• Samples arriving unlabelled or without collection date/time
documentation
1. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation:
1. Power on CMIA analyzer and ensure it is properly calibrated.
2. Verify that the refrigerator/freezer storages are within
acceptable ranges as specified by the reagent manufacturers.
3. Establish controls and calibrators in the analyzer as per the
manufacturer’s instructions.
4. Check all reagents and controls for expiry dates and ensure
validity.
B) Specimen Handling:
1. Upon receipt, log the serum samples into the LIS (Lab
Information System).
2. Centrifuge blood sample at 3000 rpm for 15 minutes to obtain
serum. If the sample has been frozen, allow it to thaw
completely at room temperature before analysis.
C) Measuring Ferritin Levels:
1. Place the appropriate number of sample tubes into the
analyzer’s sample tray along with controls and calibrators.
2. Load the Ferritin reagent kit into the analyzer.
3. Select the Ferritin testing protocol on the CMIA analyzer
software.
4. Initiate the analysis process. The analyzer will automatically mix
the sample with ferritin reagents and measure
chemiluminescent signal.
D) Reporting Results:
1. Once the analysis is complete, check the quality control
material. Ensure all controls fall within the acceptable range. If
controls are out of range, troubleshoot accordingly and repeat
the test.
2. Review the results for each sample in the analyzer software.
3. Verify the results and ensure no errors or inconsistencies. If any
sample shows unexpected values or requires additional checks,
re-run the analysis.
4. Transfer results from the analyzer to the LIS for final reporting.
5. Record results, including any observations or deviations, in lab
notebooks.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
7. Each new batch of reagents must be verified with control
materials before use.
8. Perform internal quality control checks daily using low, medium,
and high control levels; document these results.
9. Monthly comparison of analyzer results with another certified
equipment or external verification.
10. REFERENCE INTERVALS:
Adult Males: 30-400 ng/mL
Adult Females: 13-300 ng/mL
Reference intervals may vary slightly depending on the laboratory's
specific method and population.
1. LIMITATIONS:
2. Hemolyzed or lipemic samples may affect results.
3. Samples should be tested within the stability period specified by
the manufacturer.
4. Refer to Ferritin reagent kit's instruction manual for any specific
limitations.
5. DOCUMENTATION AND MAINTENANCE:
6. Update the temperature and equipment logs daily.
7. Ensure all performance logs, troubleshooting, and corrective
actions are documented.
8. Validate new lots of reagents or new equipment with
comparative testing before general use.
By strictly adhering to this SOP, we can ensure the accurate and
reliable measurement of serum ferritin levels, aiding in the diagnosis
and monitoring of iron-related disorders.
