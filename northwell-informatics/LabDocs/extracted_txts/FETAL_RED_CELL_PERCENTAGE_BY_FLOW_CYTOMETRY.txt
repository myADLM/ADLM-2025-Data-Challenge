Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Analytical Phase: Fetal Red Cell Percentage by Flow Cytometry
1. PURPOSE
This procedure outlines the steps to analyze the percentage of fetal
red cells in maternal blood using flow cytometry.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing and
documenting the procedure, as well as troubleshooting any issues
related to the analysis.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen Type:
• Maternal peripheral blood collected in EDTA (lavender top) tubes.
Specimen Stability:
• Specimens are stable for up to 24 hours when stored at 2-8°C.
• Specimen should be processed as soon as possible to ensure
accurate measurement.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens with visible clots.
• Specimens that exceed the 24-hour stability limit.
• Tubes that are improperly labeled or have a missing collection
date/time.

1. PROCEDURE
Specimen Preparation:
1. Label polypropylene tubes appropriately to ensure accurate
specimen identification.
2. Measure 100μL of maternal peripheral blood into a labeled
polypropylene tube.
3. Add 1mL of fetal RBC lysis buffer to each tube, mix gently by
vortexing.
4. Incubate the samples at room temperature for 10 minutes.
5. Centrifuge the tubes at 300 x g for 5 minutes to pellet the
RBCs.
6. Aspirate the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 500μL of
PBS.
Staining: 7. Add 10μL of anti-HbF antibody to the tubes containing the
resuspended pellet. 8. Include isotype control antibodies to additional
tubes as a negative control. 9. Incubate the tubes at room
temperature for 30 minutes, protected from light. 10. Wash the cells
with 1mL of PBS and centrifuge at 300 x g for 5 minutes. 11. Aspirate
the supernatant and resuspend the cells in 500μL of PBS.
Flow Cytometry Analysis: 12. Turn on the flow cytometer and perform
instrument startup procedures according to manufacturer’s
guidelines. 13. Load sheath fluid and check all fluidics and optical
components. 14. Calibrate the flow cytometer using commercial
calibration beads to ensure accurate measurement. 15. Run the
unstained sample to set up baseline parameters. 16. Run isotype
control to establish background fluorescence levels. 17. Analyze the
stained samples to detect HbF-positive red cells. 18. Collect and
analyze data to determine the percentage of fetal red cells in
maternal blood.
Data Analysis and Reporting: 19. Utilize flow cytometry software to
calculate the percentage of fetal red cells. 20. Review and verify the
accuracy of obtained percentages. 21. Adjust gating and
compensation settings if needed based on control samples. 22.
Document results on the respective Fetal Red Cell Percentage
Report form. 23. Report results according to laboratory guidelines.
Quality Control:
• Perform routine instrument maintenance and calibration for
accurate results.
• Run positive and negative controls with each batch of specimens.
• Troubleshoot if QC results fall outside acceptable limits and notify
the designated supervisor.
