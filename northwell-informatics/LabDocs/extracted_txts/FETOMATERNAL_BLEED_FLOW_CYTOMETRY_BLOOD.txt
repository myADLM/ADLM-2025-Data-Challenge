STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP) TITLE:
FETOMATERNAL BLEED, FLOW CYTOMETRY, BLOOD
1. PURPOSE To provide detailed procedures for the analysis and
interpretation of fetomaternal bleed (FMH) using flow cytometry
for the detection and quantification of fetal red blood cells in
maternal blood.
2. SCOPE This procedure applies to all trained laboratory
personnel responsible for performing FMH testing using flow
cytometry.
3. RESPONSIBILITY It is the responsibility of trained laboratory
personnel to perform and document the analysis according to
this SOP. The supervisor/manager is responsible for ensuring
compliance and addressing any issues.
4. PRINCIPLE Flow cytometry is used to detect and quantify fetal
red blood cells (RBCs) in maternal blood samples. This
information helps determine the need for Rh immunoglobulin
administration and the appropriate dosage.
5. SPECIMEN 5.1. Specimen Type: Maternal peripheral blood
samples collected in EDTA tubes.
5.2. Specimen Collection and Handling:
• Collect a minimum of 4 mL of maternal peripheral blood into an
EDTA tube.
• Label the tube with patient identification including name, date of
birth, and collection date/time.
• Mix the sample gently by inversion to avoid clotting.
• Transport the sample to the laboratory at 4°C and process within
24 hours of collection.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Flow cytometer (calibrated and validated)
• EDTA blood collection tubes
• Anti-HbF monoclonal antibodies (fluorochrome-conjugated)
• Red cell lysis buffer
• Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS)
• Fixative solution
• Flow cytometry analysis software
• Vortex mixer
• Pipettes and tips
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
1. PROCEDURE 7.1. Sample Preparation
2. Verify patient identity and documentation before processing the
sample.
3. Pipette 50 µL of well-mixed maternal blood into a flow cytometry
tube.
4. Add 50 µL of PBS to the tube and mix gently using a vortex
mixer.
5. Add 5 µL of anti-HbF monoclonal antibody to the tube and mix
gently by vortexing.
6. Incubate the mixture at room temperature for 15-20 minutes in
the dark.
7. Add 2 mL of red cell lysis buffer and incubate for an additional
10 minutes at room temperature.
8. Centrifuge the tube at 300 x g for 5 minutes and carefully
discard the supernatant.
9. Wash the cell pellet with 2 mL PBS and centrifuge again at 300
x g for 5 minutes.
10. Discard the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in 500 µL
of PBS.
11. Add 200 µL of fixative solution to the resuspended cells and
incubate for 10 minutes at room temperature.
12. Filter the sample through a 70-µm mesh filter into a new flow
cytometry tube to prevent clumping.
13. Store the prepared sample at 4°C if immediate analysis is not
possible.
7.2. Flow Cytometry Analysis
1. Calibrate and perform quality control checks on the flow
cytometer as per manufacturer's instructions.
2. Load the prepared sample onto the flow cytometer.
3. Set up the gating parameters to identify fetal red blood cells
(HbF-positive).
4. Acquire data for at least 50,000 events per sample.
5. Analyze the data to quantify the percentage of fetal red blood
cells present in the maternal blood sample.
6. Record the results and generate a detailed report.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform instrument calibration and control checks daily before
analyzing patient samples.
• Include positive and negative controls with each batch of samples
analyzed.
• Ensure all reagents are within their expiration dates and stored
according to manufacturers' guidelines.
1. CALCULATIONS AND INTERPRETATION
• Calculate the volume of fetomaternal hemorrhage using the
following formula: Volume (mL) of fetal RBCs = [(% HbF-positive
cells in maternal blood / 100) x maternal blood volume (mL)]
• Use the standard maternal blood volume estimate (70 mL/kg) or
actual maternal blood volume if known.
• Interpret results in accordance with clinical guidelines to
determine the need and dosage of Rh immunoglobulin
administration.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• All results should be reviewed and verified by a qualified
technologist.
• Record results in the laboratory information system (LIS).
• Communicate critical results to the clinician immediately and
document the communication as per laboratory protocol.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Interpretation of results should follow the established clinical
guidelines for fetomaternal hemorrhage.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Ensure proper sample collection, handling, and processing to
avoid false-negative or false-positive results.
• Cross-reactivity with other fetal cells should be considered and
ruled out.

antibody reagents.
