Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Fetomaternal Bleed
Analysis
1. PURPOSE
The SOP outlines the procedures for detecting and quantifying
fetomaternal hemorrhage (FMH) in maternal blood samples using
flow cytometry to ensure accurate and timely results.
Responsibility
• Designated staff perform the analysis and document results as
defined in this procedure.
• Supervisors ensure the procedure is followed correctly and
address any analytical issues that may arise.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Flow Cytometer
• Fetal Hemoglobin Kit (e.g., Fetal Hemoglobin Staining Kit)
• Biological Safety Cabinet
• Centrifuge
• PBS (Phosphate Buffered Saline)
• Fixative Solution
• FACS Tubes
• Control Samples (negative and positive controls)
Specimen Requirements:
• Preferred/acceptable: 3-5 mL EDTA-anticoagulated maternal
blood sample
• Unacceptable: Clotted samples, samples in incorrect
anticoagulant tubes, samples received more than 24 hours post-
collection
1. PROCEDURE
Preparation of Samples:
a. Inspect the maternal blood sample for any signs of clotting or
incorrect labeling. b. Gently invert the sample 8-10 times to ensure
proper mixing of anticoagulants. c. Aliquot 100 µL of the maternal
blood sample into a FACS tube.
Staining and Fixation:
a. Add 10 µL of the Fetal Hemoglobin Staining Kit reagent to the
FACS tube containing the maternal blood. b. Mix gently and incubate
the samples at room temperature for 15 minutes to allow for
adequate staining. c. Wash the stained cells by adding 1 mL PBS to
each tube and centrifuge at 300 g for 5 minutes. d. Discard the
supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 500 µL PBS. e. Add 500 µL
of fixative solution to the resuspended cells and incubate for 10
minutes at room temperature. f. Wash the fixed cells two times with 1
mL PBS, centrifuge at 300 g for 5 minutes, resuspend in 500 µL PBS.
Flow Cytometry Analysis:
a. Calibrate the flow cytometer following the manufacturer's
instructions. b. Run negative and positive control samples to ensure
proper functioning and calibration of the flow cytometer. c. Load the
prepared maternal blood sample into the flow cytometer. d. Record
and analyze data to quantify the percentage of fetal red blood cells
present in the maternal blood sample.
Quality Control:
• Perform controls for each batch of samples to ensure validity and
accuracy of results.
• Follow site-specific guidelines for the documentation and
validation of control results.
Reporting Results:
• Results are reviewed and verified by the technologist.
• Quantification of FMH is reported in the patient’s record
accordingly.
Critical Results:
• Any critical results indicating significant FMH (>0.3% fetal RBCs)
must be flagged and reviewed immediately.
• Document any immediate actions taken, such as notifying the
clinical team.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS:
• Normal reference range for FMH: <0.3% fetal RBCs in maternal
blood
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
• Results may be affected by hemolysis or sample degradation.
• Proper sample handling and storage are critical to avoid
erroneous results.

Kit, and internal guidelines for flow cytometer calibration and
operation.

By adhering to this SOP, the laboratory aims to provide reliable and
accurate quantification of fetomaternal hemorrhage to support clinical
decision-making.
