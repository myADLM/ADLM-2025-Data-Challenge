Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for FGFR1 (8P11.2)
AMPLIFICATION, FISH, TISSUE
1. PURPOSE
This protocol outlines the procedures for the analytical phase of
generating results for FGFR1 (8P11.2) amplification using
Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) in tissue samples. The aim
is to ensure accurate detection and reporting of genomic
amplifications in FGFR1 and provide diagnostic information crucial
for patient management.
Responsibility:
All laboratory personnel who perform FISH analysis on tissue
samples are responsible for adhering to this SOP. It is the
responsibility of the lab supervisor to ensure proper training and
compliance with the protocol.
2. SPECIMEN
Preferred/acceptable:
• Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks or
unstained tissue slides.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Fluorescence microscope
• FGFR1-specific FISH probe set (containing FGFR1 probe and
control probe specific for centromere of chromosome 8)
• Vysis hybridization buffer or equivalent
• Coverslips and slides
• Ethanol (70%, 85%, 100%)
• Xylene
• Pepsin solution (1% in 0.01N HCl)
• Denaturation solution (70% formamide/2X SSC)
• Wash solution (2X SSC and 0.1X SSC)
• Counterstain (DAPI)
4. PROCEDURE
A. Slide Preparation:
1. Deparaffinization:
◦ Place 3-5 micron FFPE tissue sections on positively
charged slides.
◦ Immerse slides in xylene for 10 minutes (twice) to remove
paraffin.
◦ Sequentially immerse slides in 100%, 85%, and 70%
ethanol for 5 minutes each.
◦ Air dry the slides.
2. Pretreatment:
◦ Treat slides with pre-warmed 1% pepsin solution at 37°C for
10 minutes.
◦ Wash slides in 2X SSC at room temperature for 5 minutes.
◦ Dehydrate slides in graded ethanol (70%, 85%, 100%) for 2
minutes each. Air dry again.
B. Probe Hybridization:
1. Denaturation:
◦ Apply 10 µL of Vysis hybridization buffer containing FGFR1
probe to each slide.
◦ Cover with a glass coverslip and seal the edges with rubber
cement.
◦ Denature the tissue and probe by incubating the slides at
73°C for 5 minutes.
2. Hybridization:
◦ Transfer slides to an incubator set at 37°C overnight (16-18
hours).
C. Post-Hybridization Washes:
1. Post-Hybridization:
◦ Remove coverslip and wash slides in 2X SSC at 73°C for 2
minutes.
◦ Wash slides in 0.1X SSC at room temperature for 2 minutes.
◦ Rinse slides briefly in distilled water and then air dry.
D. Counterstain and Mounting:
1. Counterstain with DAPI:
◦ Apply 10 µL of DAPI counterstain to the slide.
◦ Cover with a glass coverslip and allow drying.
5. ANALYSIS AND INTERPRETATION
1. Microscopy:
◦ Analyze the slides using a fluorescence microscope
equipped with appropriate filters for detecting FGFR1 and
control probes.
◦ Count the number of FGFR1 signals and control signals
(centromere of chromosome 8) in at least 50 non-
overlapping interphase nuclei.
2. Interpretation:
◦ For FGFR1 amplification, analyze the ratio of FGFR1
signals to control signals.
◦ Standard criteria for amplification usually define a copy
number gain as a FGFR1/control ratio ≥2.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include positive and negative control slides with each batch.
• Ensure proper calibration of the fluorescence microscope.
• Record all observations, including FGFR1 and control counts, and
quality control results in the appropriate log book.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Provide a detailed report including the ratio of FGFR1/control
signals, interpretation of findings (amplified vs. normal), and any
relevant comments.
