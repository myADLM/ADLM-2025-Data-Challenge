• Equipment:
◦ Fluorescence microscope
◦ ThermoBrite hybridization system or equivalent
◦ Microtome
◦ Incubator (37°C)
• Reagents:

◦ xylene
◦ Ethanol (70%, 85%, 100%)
◦ 10 mM citric acid buffer, pH 6.0
◦ Proteinase K solution (20 μg/mL)
◦ 2x SSC (Saline-Sodium Citrate) buffer
◦ Formamide solution
◦ Denaturing solution

4. Procedure
Slide Preparation
1. Deparaffinization:
◦ Immerse slides in xylene for 10 minutes, twice.
◦ Wash in 100% ethanol for 5 minutes, twice.
◦ Air dry.
2. Pretreatment:
◦ Immerse slides in preheated 10 mM citric acid buffer at 95°C
for 10 minutes.
◦ Cool slides in distilled water for 2 minutes.
◦ Treat with proteinase K solution at 37°C for 10 minutes.
◦ Wash in distilled water for 2 minutes.
3. Denaturation:
◦ Immerse slides in 2x SSC buffer at room temperature for 5
minutes.
◦ Treat with denaturing solution (70% formamide/2x SSC) at
73°C for 5 minutes.
◦ Quickly immerse in 2x SSC buffer at room temperature for 5
minutes.
◦ Air dry in darkness.
Hybridization
1. Probe Preparation:
◦ Prepare the FGFR2 FISH probe mixture according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
◦ Denature the probe at 73°C for 5 minutes.
2. Hybridization:
◦ Apply 10 μL of the prepared probe mixture to each slide.
◦ Cover with a coverslip and seal edges with rubber cement.
◦ Hybridize in the humidity chamber at 37°C overnight (16-20
hours).
Post-Hybridization Washes
1. Wash:
◦ Remove coverslip carefully.
◦ Wash slides in 0.4x SSC/0.3% NP-40 buffer at 73°C for 2
minutes.
◦ Wash slides in 2x SSC/0.1% NP-40 buffer at room
temperature for 1 minute.
◦ Air dry in darkness.
Counterstaining
1. Counterstain:
◦ Apply 10 μL of DAPI mounting medium to each slide.
◦ Cover with a clean coverslip.
Analysis
1. Microscopy:
◦ Analyze slides under a fluorescence microscope equipped
with appropriate filters (e.g., DAPI, FITC, Texas Red).
◦ Examine multiple fields to ensure representative results.
◦ Document number of cells with FGFR2 rearrangement vs.
normal cells.
5. Quality Control
• Positive Control: Use tissue samples known to contain FGFR2
rearrangements.
• Negative Control: Use tissue samples known to lack FGFR2
rearrangements.
• Ensure compliance with all procedural steps and reagent
specifications.
6. Reporting Results
• Interpretation:
◦ Presence of FGFR2 rearrangement: Positive for
rearrangement
◦ Absence of FGFR2 rearrangement: Negative for
rearrangement
• Documentation:
◦ Record all findings, including total cells counted, number of
cells with abnormal FISH signal patterns.
◦ Provide comments on sample quality and any technical issues
that could impact results.
• Verification:
◦ Results must be verified by an experienced technologist or
pathologist prior to reporting.
◦ Any ambiguous results should be reviewed and re-analyzed if
necessary.

8. Method Limitations
• Possible Interferences:
◦ Tissue section thickness variations
◦ Inadequate fixation or pretreatment
◦ Hybridization efficiency
• Mitigation Strategies:
◦ Ensure consistent slide preparation
◦ Use controls to validate each batch of tests
◦ Adjust protocol based on specimen type and condition
9. Confidentiality and Safety
• Ensure confidentiality of patient information.
• Follow all laboratory safety protocols, including handling of
reagents and disposal of waste.
