Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for FH Mutation
Analysis using Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) for
Tumor Samples
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedures for the analytical
phase of generating results for FH (Fumarate Hydratase) mutation
analysis using Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) in tumor samples.
This protocol ensures the accurate, precise, and timely detection of
FH mutations for diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutic decision-
making in patients with suspected hereditary leiomyomatosis and
renal cell carcinoma (HLRCC) syndrome.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
• The Laboratory Director oversees the implementation and
compliance with the SOP.
• Laboratory Technologists/Scientists are responsible for performing
the analytical procedures as described and documenting all
actions and observations.
• The Quality Control (QC) Officer ensures adherence to quality
assurance standards and monitors QC procedures.

• Nuclease-free tubes and pipette tips
• Ethanol for DNA precipitation
• Sequencing consumables (flow cells, reagent cartridges)
5. PROCEDURE
5.1. DNA Extraction
1. FFPE Tissue:
◦ Deparaffinize FFPE sections using a xylene-ethanol series
or manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Follow the DNA extraction kit protocol to isolate DNA from
deparaffinized sections.
2. Fresh Frozen Tissue:
◦ Follow the DNA extraction kit protocol to isolate DNA from
fresh frozen tumor tissue.
3. DNA Quantification and Quality Check:
◦ Quantify the extracted DNA using NanoDrop or Qubit,
ensuring a minimum yield of 500 ng.
◦ Assess DNA integrity using Bioanalyzer or TapeStation to
confirm DNA quality suitable for NGS.
5.2. PCR Amplification (If necessary)
• Design and verify primers specific to the FH gene regions of
interest.
• Perform PCR amplification of target regions under optimal cycling
conditions.
• Purify PCR products using appropriate purification kits.
5.3. Library Preparation
• Prepare sequencing libraries using the NGS library preparation kit
according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
• Include steps for end-repair, A-tailing, adapter ligation, and
enrichment PCR.
• Assess library quality and size distribution using Bioanalyzer or
TapeStation.
5.4. Sequencing
1. Library Normalization and Pooling:
◦ Quantify libraries and normalize to required concentration.
◦ Pool libraries if running multiple samples.
2. Load Libraries onto NGS Platform:
◦ Load appropriately pooled libraries onto the NGS platform.
◦ Set up sequencing run according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
5.5. Data Analysis
1. Quality Control Checking:
◦ Utilize bioinformatics software tools to assess raw
sequencing data quality (e.g., FastQC).
◦ Filter out low-quality reads and adapters using appropriate
software.
2. Alignment and Variant Calling:
◦ Align filtered reads to the reference human genome (e.g.,
hg19 or hg38) using aligners like BWA or Bowtie2.
◦ Perform variant calling using software tools like GATK or
VarScan.
3. Annotation and Interpretation:
◦ Annotate identified variants using variant annotation tools
(e.g., ANNOVAR, SnpEff).
◦ Interpret the detected FH mutations based on variant
databases (e.g., ClinVar, COSMIC) and current literature.
5.6. Reporting Results
• Document findings in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Review and interpret results according to the clinical context.
• Generate and issue a comprehensive report to the referring
clinician, detailing mutation type, zygosity, clinical relevance, and
recommended follow-up actions.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include positive and negative controls throughout the process.
• Perform bi-weekly and monthly QC checks as described in the
relevant QC section.
• Log and review QC data regularly to ensure consistency and
reliability.
