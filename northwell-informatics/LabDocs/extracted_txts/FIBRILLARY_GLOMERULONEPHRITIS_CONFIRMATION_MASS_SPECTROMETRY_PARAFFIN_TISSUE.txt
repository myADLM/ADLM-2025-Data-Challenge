Standard Operating Protocol (SOP) for
Fibrillary Glomerulonephritis Confirmation
using Mass Spectrometry on Paraffin
Tissue
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for the confirmation of fibrillary
glomerulonephritis using mass spectrometry analysis on paraffin-
embedded tissue specimens.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the mass
spectrometry analysis, ensuring sample integrity, interpreting results,
and recording data. Supervisors are responsible for ensuring
adherence to protocols and addressing any issues related to the
testing process.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type:
• Paraffin-embedded kidney tissue
Specimen Collection:
• Ensure tissue samples are properly collected, fixed in formalin,
and embedded in paraffin.
• Tissue samples should be labeled with patient information and
collection details.
Specimen Handling:
• Maintain specimen integrity by storing paraffin blocks at ambient
temperature.
• Avoid exposure to moisture and contamination.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Microtome for sectioning paraffin-embedded tissue
• Reagents for tissue deparaffinization and protein extraction
• Mass spectrometer
• Centrifuge, Pipettes, Tubes, Filters
Reagents:
• Xylene for deparaffinization
• Ethanol (100%, 95%, 70%)
• Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS)
• Protein extraction buffer
• Trypsin for protein digestion
5. PROCEDURE
A) Tissue preparation:
1. Sectioning:
◦ Obtain paraffin-embedded tissue block.
◦ Cut 5-10 μm tissue sections using a microtome and transfer
sections to appropriate slides.
2. Deparaffinization:
◦ Immerse slides in xylene for 10 minutes.
◦ Submerge slides in 100% ethanol for 5 minutes, followed by
95% ethanol and 70% ethanol for 5 minutes each.
◦ Rinse slides with distilled water.
B) Protein Extraction:
1. Tissue Removal:
◦ Carefully scrape deparaffinized tissue sections off the slides
into a microcentrifuge tube.
◦ Add protein extraction buffer to the tube.
2. Incubation:
◦ Incubate the tissue sample in protein extraction buffer at
56°C for 1 hour with periodic vortexing.
◦ Centrifuge to remove debris and collect the supernatant
containing extracted protein.
3. Protein Digestion:
◦ Add trypsin solution to the extracted protein and incubate at
37°C for 6-18 hours to digest proteins into peptides.
C) Mass Spectrometry Analysis:
1. Sample Preparation:
◦ Prepare peptide samples by purifying with appropriate
filters.
◦ Concentrate samples if necessary.
2. Instrument Calibration:
◦ Calibrate the mass spectrometer as per manufacturer's
instructions.
◦ Ensure the correct set-up for peptide analysis.
3. Loading Samples:
◦ Load the prepared peptide samples into the mass
spectrometer.
4. Data Acquisition:
◦ Run the samples under pre-determined settings optimized
for peptide identification.
◦ Collect and store raw data for analysis.
D) Data Analysis:
1. Processing Data:
◦ Use mass spectrometry software to interpret the raw data.
◦ Identify and quantify peptides that match the fibrillary
glomerulonephritis protein profile.
2. Validation:
◦ Validate the findings by comparing detected peptide
sequences with references specific to fibrillary
glomerulonephritis.
E) Quality Control:
1. Validation of Results:
◦ Run standard quality control peptides to validate mass
spectrometer performance.
◦ Ensure all reagents and consumables are within expiry date
and stored appropriately.
2. Record Keeping:
◦ Document all procedures, data, results, and any anomalies
in the laboratory logbook.
◦ Ensure traceability through proper labeling and
documentation.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Interpretation:
◦ Clearly interpret the data and confirm the presence of
fibrillary glomerulonephritis based on peptide profiles.
2. Documentation:
◦ Record all findings in the laboratory information system.
◦ Generate reports for physicians detailing the results.
