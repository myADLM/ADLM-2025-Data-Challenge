STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP) Laboratory for the
Testing of Fibrinogen Antigen, Plasma
I. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for determining the fibrinogen antigen level
in plasma, ensuring accurate and reliable results are produced
promptly while maintaining laboratory compliance with CLIA
standards.
II. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all personnel engaged in the fibrinogen antigen
testing workflow within the laboratory.
III. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of laboratory staff to adhere to the protocols
established in this SOP and to promptly address any operational
issues that arise during testing. Supervisors are responsible for
ensuring staff compliance and providing training or guidance as
needed.
IV. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
1. Specimen Type:
◦ Plasma separated from citrated whole blood (Blue top tube,
3.2% Sodium Citrate).
2. Specimen Collection:
◦ Properly label the specimen with patient identification
details.
◦ Immediately invert the tube several times to ensure
complete mixing with the anticoagulant.
◦ Transport the specimen at room temperature to the
laboratory within 4 hours of collection to maintain integrity.
3. Specimen Handling:
◦ Upon arrival, centrifuge the sample at 1500 x g for 15
minutes to separate plasma.
◦ Aliquot plasma into appropriately labeled secondary tubes if
immediate testing is not possible.
◦ Plasma can be refrigerated at 2-8°C for up to 48 hours if
testing is delayed. Specimens requiring longer storage
should be frozen at -20°C or colder.
V. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
1. Equipment:
◦ Automated coagulation analyzer (e.g., Sysmex CS-5100)
◦ Centrifuge
◦ Micropipettes and tips
2. Reagents:
◦ Fibrinogen Antigen Reagent Kit (Validated for use in the
laboratory as per manufacturer instructions)
3. Supplies:
◦ 3.2% Sodium Citrate (Blue top collection tube)
◦ Secondary aliquot tubes
◦ Calibrators and controls
◦ Quality control material
VI. PROCEDURE
1. Preparation
◦ Verify that all equipment is calibrated and in good working
condition.
◦ Ensure that all reagents are within their expiration date and
have been prepared as per manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Ensure Quality Control (QC) material is ready for use.
2. Testing
◦ Set up the analyzer with the appropriate fibrinogen antigen
assay protocol.
◦ Perform daily calibration and run Quality Control (QC)
samples at the beginning, middle, and end of the run to
ensure assay integrity (refer to Quality Control section).
◦ Label all secondary tubes and patient samples clearly and
accurately.
◦ Load patient plasma samples and reagents into the analyzer
as per equipment-specific instructions.
◦ Initiate the test run using the instrument software, ensuring
all parameters align with the assay protocol.
◦ Review sample and QC results upon completion of the
assay. Address any flagged or out-of-range QC results
immediately.
VII. QUALITY CONTROL
1. QC Checks:
◦ Run High, Medium, and Low control levels at specified
intervals (beginning, middle, and end of the testing period).
◦ Examine QC results for any deviations or trends that may
affect the assay outcome. Acceptable ranges should be
predefined by the laboratory based on previous validation
data.
◦ Document and troubleshoot any QC failures. Re-run QC
material if necessary and, if persistent issues arise, consult
the supervisor.
2. Calibration:
◦ Perform calibration with each new lot of reagents and verify
that the calibration curve falls within defined acceptance
criteria.
◦ Document and resolve any anomalies encountered during
calibration before proceeding with patient samples.
VIII. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Result Interpretation:
◦ Results will be expressed in mg/dL.
◦ Ensure that each result falls within established reference
intervals. For adults, typical reference range for fibrinogen
antigen is 200-400 mg/dL. Deviations should prompt a
review or repeat testing.
2. Result Verification:
◦ Verify and review results thoroughly before reporting.
Ensure that patient demographic information and all
pertinent details are correctly attributed to the results.
3. Reporting:
◦ Record and report results to the LIS (Laboratory Information
System).
◦ Notify relevant clinical staff immediately of any critical values
or abnormal results that could impact patient care.
Reference laboratory policies for critical result thresholds
and reporting procedures.
IX. DOCUMENTATION AND RECORDKEEPING
1. Maintain accurate records of all testing, including:
◦ Specimen handling and storage logs.
◦ Calibration and QC records.
◦ Equipment maintenance logs.
◦ Result verification records.
2. Store documentation as per laboratory policy and federal
regulations. Ensure documentation is readily retrievable for
audit purposes and continuous quality improvement efforts.
X. REFERENCE LIMITS AND LIMITATIONS
1. Reference Intervals:
◦ Reference levels are provided in the reagent kit insert and
by validating in laboratory reference ranges.
2. Potential Interferences:
◦ Ensure the coherence and clarity of specimens. Hemolysis,
lipemia, and icterus can potentially interfere with assay
results.
3. Analyzer Specific Limitations:
◦ Follow the specific analytical limitations as indicated by the
equipment and reagent manufacturers to avoid erroneous
results.
