SOP: Fibrinogen, Clauss Method Analysis
1. PURPOSE
To establish a consistent and standardized procedure for the analysis
of plasma fibrinogen levels using the Clauss method, ensuring
accurate and reliable results.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all personnel performing fibrinogen testing
in plasma samples within the laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Laboratory Technologists: Responsible for performing the
assay according to this SOP and ensuring all steps are followed
to obtain accurate results.
• Supervisors: Responsible for reviewing the results and ensuring
that quality control measures are adhered to.
4. DEFINITIONS
• Fibrinogen: A plasma protein that is converted into fibrin during
blood clotting.
• Clauss Method: An assay for detecting fibrinogen concentration
based on the rate of fibrin formation triggered by a high
concentration of thrombin.
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND HANDLING
• Specimen Type: Citrated plasma.
• Collection: Blood should be collected in a light blue top (sodium
citrate) vacutainer tube.
• Volume: Minimum volume required is 1 mL of plasma.
• Stability: Plasma specimens are stable for up to 24 hours at
room temperature and up to 72 hours when refrigerated at 2-8°C.
• Unacceptable Specimens: Hemolyzed specimens, clotted
samples, improperly labelled specimens.
6. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Equipment:
◦ Semi-automated or automated coagulation analyzer.
◦ Centrifuge capable of 1500-2000 g.
◦ Timer.
• Reagents:
◦ Thrombin reagent.
◦ Calibrator plasma.
◦ Quality control plasma (normal and abnormal levels).
• Supplies:
◦ Light blue top vacutainer tubes.
◦ Disposable pipettes.
◦ Test tubes or reaction cups.
7. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation:
1. Thawing Frozen Samples: If plasma is frozen, allow it to thaw
at room temperature before analysis. Once thawed, mix gently
to ensure homogeneity.
2. Centrifugation: Centrifuge the plasma samples at 1500-2000 g
for 10-15 minutes to ensure platelet-poor plasma.
B) Calibration and Quality Control:
1. Calibration: Perform calibration of the coagulation analyzer
using calibrator plasma according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
2. Quality Control: Run normal and abnormal control plasma to
ensure the accuracy of the assay. Document all QC results.
C) Analysis:
1. Setup: Prepare the analyzer for Clauss fibrinogen testing.
2. Loading Samples: Pipette appropriate volumes of plasma into
the reaction cups.
3. Addition of Reagents: Add the thrombin reagent to the plasma
sample as per the manufacturer's protocol.
4. Timing: Start the timer immediately upon addition of thrombin.
5. Measurement: The clotting time is measured automatically by
the analyzer. The fibrinogen concentration is determined using
a pre-established calibration curve based on the clotting times.
6. Recording: Record the fibrinogen levels in the laboratory
information system.
D) Troubleshooting:
If an analyzer or reagent issue arises:
1. Repeat the test with fresh reagents.
2. Check calibration and QC results for any anomalies.
3. Consult with a supervisor if issues persist.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Reference Intervals: 200-400 mg/dL (may vary depending on the
laboratory's specific reference range).
• Verification: Ensure all results are cross-referenced with quality
control data.
• Documentation: Enter results into the LIS system, marked as
verified by the technologist.
9. QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE
• Perform quality control checks daily and with every new reagent
lot.
• Document all QC findings and review them periodically to identify
any trends or issues.
• Perform inter-laboratory comparisons if there are discrepancies in
results or upon request.
10. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Certain conditions such as high levels of fibrin degradation products,
lipemia, or direct oral anticoagulants may affect the accuracy of the
test. If these interferences are suspected, consult the supervisor and
consider alternative methods or dilutions.
