Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Fibrinogen Analysis in
Plasma
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline procedures for the analysis of
fibrinogen levels in plasma samples using a specified analytical
method. This protocol ensures the accuracy, precision, and reliability
of fibrinogen results reported by the laboratory.
1. SCOPE
This SOP applies to the analysis of fibrinogen in human plasma
samples received in the laboratory. It includes sample preparation,
analyzer operation, quality control, and result reporting.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
• Designated Staff: Responsible for performing the fibrinogen
assay according to this SOP, including maintenance of equipment
and quality control.
• Supervisors: Ensure procedures are followed correctly and are
available for troubleshooting and resolving issues.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Platelet-poor plasma
• Preferred Collection Tube: 3.2% sodium citrate (light blue top)
• Volume Required: Minimum 1 mL of plasma
• Processing: Centrifuge blood sample at 1500xg for 15 minutes at
room temperature to obtain platelet-poor plasma. Aliquot plasma
to a labeled secondary tube.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Coagulometer or automated clotting analyzer (e.g., Sysmex
CS-2100i)
• Fibrinogen reagent kit (e.g., Clauss method)
• Quality control materials (normal and abnormal fibrinogen levels)
• Calibrators
• Pipettes and tips
• Personal protective equipment (gloves, lab coat)
1. QUALITY CONTROL
Quality control checks must be performed at the beginning of each
shift, with each new reagent lot, and after any major maintenance or
adjustments to the analyzer.
• QC Material:
◦ Normal Control: Known fibrinogen concentration within the
normal range.
◦ Abnormal Control: Known fibrinogen concentration outside the
normal range.
Perform assay control checks:
• Load control material as per manufacturer instructions.
• Run controls and verify results fall within acceptable limits before
proceeding with patient samples.
• Document QC results in the QC logbook.
1. CALIBRATION
• Perform calibration as per manufacturer’s instructions using
designated fibrinogen calibrators.
• Calibrate the instrument:
◦ After introducing a new lot of reagents.
◦ Whenever QC results do not fall within acceptable ranges.
◦ At intervals specified by the analyzer’s manufacturer.
1. PROCEDURE
2. Preparation:
◦ Verify that all reagents and consumables are within their
expiration dates and stored correctly.
◦ Allow reagents to reach room temperature if kept
refrigerated.
◦ Prepare the analyzer by following the manufacturer’s start-
up and calibration procedures.
3. Sample Handling:
◦ Verify sample integrity and proper labeling.
◦ If samples are frozen, thaw at 37°C and mix gently.
◦ Load samples into the analyzer according to the
manufacturer’s guidelines.
4. Sample Analysis:
◦ Select the fibrinogen assay on the analyzer’s menu.
◦ Load patient samples and ensure there is no sample
carryover.
◦ Run the test according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
◦ Ensure all assay parameters comply with the specified
guidelines for the Clauss method (or the specified method if
different).
5. Result Recording:
◦ Review the results for each sample.
◦ Verify internal QC results and ensure they fall within
acceptable ranges.
◦ If QC fails, troubleshoot according to manufacturer
recommendations and repeat the assay.
◦ Record the fibrinogen levels in the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
6. REPORTING RESULTS
• Reference Intervals:
◦ Normal fibrinogen range: 200-400 mg/dL
• Critical Values:
◦ Fibrinogen < 100 mg/dL and > 600 mg/dL should be flagged
for immediate review and possible repeat testing or
confirmation.
• Document any critical values and notify the appropriate
healthcare provider per laboratory policy.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If erroneous results are suspected (e.g., fibrinogen levels outside
physiological range), check for:
◦ Sample integrity issues (e.g., hemolysis, clots).
◦ Proper calibration and QC performance.
◦ Equipment malfunctions or errors, referencing error log for
troubleshooting guidance.
1. MAINTENANCE
Routine maintenance should be performed according to the
analyzer’s specifications:
• Daily: Instrument cleaning, reagent replacement.
• Weekly: Detailed cleaning, inspect tubings and connections.
• Monthly: More extensive servicing as outlined by the
manufacturer.
Document all maintenance activities in the instrument maintenance
log.
1. SAFETY AND DISPOSAL
• Use PPE at all times when handling specimens.
• Dispose of biohazardous waste according to the laboratory’s
waste disposal protocols.
• Follow all institutional safety guidelines.
