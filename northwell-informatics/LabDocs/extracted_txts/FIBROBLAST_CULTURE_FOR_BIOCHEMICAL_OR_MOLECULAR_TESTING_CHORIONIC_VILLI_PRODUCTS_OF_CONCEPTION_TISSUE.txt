Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) for Fibroblast
Culture for Biochemical or Molecular Testing:
Chorionic Villi/Products of Conception/Tissue
1. PURPOSE:
To provide step-by-step instructions for the culture of fibroblasts from
chorionic villi, products of conception, or tissue specimens for
subsequent biochemical or molecular testing.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS:
• Specimen Types:
◦ Chorionic villi
◦ Products of conception
◦ Tissue specimens
• Specimen Collection:
◦ Sterile collection is essential. Specimen should be collected
using aseptic techniques and placed in a sterile container with
culture medium or transport medium designed for tissue
specimens.
• Transport Conditions:
◦ Specimens should be transported to the laboratory
immediately at room temperature.
◦ Specimen should not be frozen.
• Unacceptable Specimens:
◦ Specimens that arrive frozen or are excessively delayed
(greater than 24 hours post-collection).
◦ Specimens without appropriate labeling and requisition
documentation.
3. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES:
• Sterile culture media (e.g., Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium
(DMEM) with 10-20% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and antibiotics)
• Sterile containers and tubes
• Laminar flow hood
• Incubator set to 37°C with 5% CO2
• Sterile forceps and scalpels
• Tissue culture dishes or flasks
• Centrifuge
• Inverted microscope
• Hemocytometer or cell counter
• Trypsin-EDTA solution
• Cryopreservation materials (if needed)
4. CULTURE PROCEDURE:
1. Preparation:
◦ Ensure all equipment and supplies are sterile and
operational.
◦ Prepare culture media and pre-warm to 37°C.
2. Specimen Handling:
◦ In a laminar flow hood, place the specimen in a sterile petri
dish.
◦ Using sterile forceps and scalpels, carefully dissect the
specimen to obtain the chorionic villi or specific tissue
fragments.
3. Initial Culture:
◦ Transfer dissected tissue into a sterile culture dish or flask.
◦ Add sufficient culture media to cover the tissue.
◦ Place the dish or flask in an incubator set at 37°C with 5%
CO2.
4. Monitoring and Maintenance:
◦ After 24-48 hours, examine cultures under an inverted
microscope for fibroblast attachment and proliferation.
◦ Change the culture media every 2-3 days to provide fresh
nutrients and remove waste.
5. Subculturing (Passaging):
◦ When cells reach 80-90% confluence, subculture them
using trypsin-EDTA solution:
▪ Remove media and wash cells with PBS.
▪ Add trypsin-EDTA to detach cells and incubate for 2-5
minutes.
▪ Neutralize trypsin using culture media with FBS.
▪ Centrifuge detached cells at 800-1000 rpm for 5 minutes.
▪ Resuspend cell pellet in fresh culture media and transfer
to new culture dishes or flasks.
6. Cell Counting:
◦ Determine cell concentration using a hemocytometer or
automated cell counter.
◦ Adjust cell density as needed for further culturing or testing.
7. Cryopreservation (Optional):
◦ For long-term storage, cells can be cryopreserved using a
cryopreservation medium (e.g., DMEM with 10% DMSO).
◦ Aliquot cells into cryovials and store in liquid nitrogen.
5. REPORTING RESULTS:
• Fibroblast cultures should be documented, noting the date of
initiation, confluence status, passaging records, and any observed
abnormalities.
• Results from biochemical/molecular testing conducted on cultured
fibroblasts should be reported according to lab-specific protocols.
6. QUALITY CONTROL:
• Ensure all culture media and reagents are within expiration dates
and stored appropriately.
• Regularly calibrate and maintain all laboratory equipment.
• Perform regular sterility checks of incubators and laminar flow
hoods.

• Standard culture techniques for fibroblast cells.
