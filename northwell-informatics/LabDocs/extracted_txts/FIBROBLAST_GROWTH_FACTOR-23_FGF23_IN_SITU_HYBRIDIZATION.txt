Standard Operating Procedures (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase Procedures for Generating Results for
FIBROBLAST GROWTH FACTOR-23 (FGF23), IN SITU
HYBRIDIZATION
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedure for analyzing and
generating results for FIBROBLAST GROWTH FACTOR-23 (FGF23)
using in situ hybridization (ISH) techniques.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all personnel involved in the analytical
phase of the FGF23 ISH assay, including preparation of reagents,
hybridization, detection, and results interpretation.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Laboratory Technicians: Perform the analytical procedure as per
this SOP.
• Supervisors: Ensure compliance with the SOP and review the
results.
• Quality Control Personnel: Conduct quality control checks and
validation of the process and results.
4. DEFINITIONS
• In Situ Hybridization (ISH): A technique used to detect specific
nucleic acid sequences within fixed tissues and cells.
• FGF23: Fibroblast Growth Factor-23, a hormone involved in
phosphate regulation.
5. MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT
• Hybridization Oven
• Microtome
• Slide warmer
• Hybridization chamber
• Microscope
• ISH probe specific to FGF23
• Positive and negative control samples
• Hybridization buffer
• Wash buffers
• Detection reagents (e.g., labeled antibodies or chromogenic
substrates)
• Coverslips
• Mounting medium
6. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE)
tissue sections.
• Specimen Handling: Ensure tissues are properly fixed and
sectioned at 4-6 micrometers for optimal hybridization.
7. PROCEDURE
A. Pre-Hybridization Preparation
1. Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
◦ Place slides in a series of xylene baths for deparaffinization.
◦ Rehydrate in decreasing concentrations of ethanol (100%,
95%, 70%, 50%) followed by distilled water.
2. Antigen Retrieval:
◦ Perform heat-induced epitope retrieval (HIER) using citrate
buffer (pH 6.0) or EDTA buffer (pH 8.0) at 95-98°C for 20
minutes. Cool to room temperature.
B. Hybridization
1. Hybridization Buffer Preparation:
◦ Prepare hybridization buffer as specified by the probe
manufacturer.
2. Probe Preparation:
◦ Dilute FGF23-specific probe in hybridization buffer
according to manufacturer’s instructions.
3. Hybridization:
◦ Apply the diluted probe to the tissue sections.
◦ Cover the tissue sections with coverslips to prevent
evaporation.
4. Incubation:
◦ Place the slides in a hybridization chamber pre-warmed to
37-42°C.
◦ Incubate for 12-24 hours.
C. Post-Hybridization Washes
1. Stringency Washes:
◦ Remove coverslips and wash slides in pre-warmed wash
buffers to remove non-specifically bound probe.
◦ Perform washes of increasing stringency as recommended
by the probe manufacturer.
D. Detection
1. Blocking:
◦ Apply blocking solution to prevent non-specific binding of
detection reagents.
2. Detection Reagent Application:
◦ Apply labeled antibodies or chromogenic substrates as
specified.
◦ Incubate for the recommended time period.
3. Substrate Development (if using chromogenic detection):
◦ Develop the signal using appropriate substrate until the
desired signal-to-noise ratio is achieved.
4. Counterstaining (optional):
◦ Counterstain with hematoxylin or other nuclear stains if
required.
E. Mounting
1. Mount slides using an appropriate medium and cover with
coverslips.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run positive and negative control samples with each batch to
ensure assay performance.
• Document and review the control results before interpreting
patient results.
9. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
• Examine slides under a microscope.
• Evaluate the presence and localization of FGF23 mRNA signals
within the tissue.
• Compare with control samples to ensure specificity.
10. REPORTING RESULTS
• Document findings in the laboratory information system (LIS).
• Ensure the report includes the signal pattern, intensity, and
localization along with appropriate clinical interpretation.
