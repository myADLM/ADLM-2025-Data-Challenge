1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to detail the analytical phase procedures
for generating results for Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor 1
(FGFR1) Immunostain, Technical Component Only, in a CLIA-
certified laboratory. This includes preparing and processing the
specimens, staining protocol, quality control measures, result
documentation, and reporting.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of designated laboratory technologists to
perform the FGFR1 immunostaining procedure according to this
SOP. It is also the responsibility of the laboratory supervisor to ensure
that all procedures are followed accurately and that all data is
documented correctly.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND PREPARATION
Specimen Type:
• Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue samples
Specimen Handling:
• Ensure all FFPE tissue samples are received in secure and
properly labelled containers.
• Verify specimen identification with accompanying requisition
forms before proceeding.
• Store specimens at room temperature until ready for processing.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Microtome
• Water bath
• Incubator
• Microscopy slides
• Slide racks
Reagents:
• FGFR1 primary antibody solution
• Secondary antibody solution
• Detection system (e.g., DAB substrate kit)
• Counterstain (e.g., hematoxylin)
• PBS (Phosphate Buffered Saline) buffer
• Mounting medium
Supplies:
• Glass slides, coverslips
• Forceps, pipettes
• Humidity chamber
• Timer
5. PROCEDURE
Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
1. Warm the slides to 60°C for 1 hour to melt the paraffin.
2. Immerse slides in xylene for 3 x 5 minutes to remove paraffin.
3. Rehydrate slides by passing through decreasing concentrations
of ethanol (100%, 95%, 70%) for 2 minutes each, followed by a
final rinse in distilled water.
Antigen Retrieval:
1. Immerse slides in citrate buffer or another appropriate antigen
retrieval solution.
2. Heat in a microwave or steamer for 20 minutes.
3. Allow slides to cool to room temperature in the buffer.
4. Rinse slides in PBS buffer for 5 minutes.
Blocking Non-Specific Binding:
1. Incubate slides in a blocking solution (e.g., 5% BSA in PBS) for
30 minutes at room temperature.
Primary Antibody Incubation:
1. Dilute the FGFR1 primary antibody to the required
concentration as per manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Apply the primary antibody solution to the slides and incubate
overnight at 4°C in a humidity chamber.
Secondary Antibody Incubation:
1. Rinse slides 3 times in PBS buffer, 5 minutes each.
2. Apply secondary antibody solution and incubate for 30 minutes
at room temperature.
3. Rinse slides 3 times in PBS buffer, 5 minutes each.
Detection:
1. Apply the detection system (e.g., DAB substrate) to the slides
according to manufacturer’s protocol.
2. Monitor for color development under the microscope.
3. Stop the reaction by rinsing slides in distilled water.
Counterstaining:
1. Dip slides in hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes.
2. Rinse slides in running tap water for 5 minutes.
3. Dehydrate slides in increasing concentrations of ethanol (70%,
95%, 100%) and clear in xylene.
Mounting:
1. Apply a few drops of mounting medium to the slides.
2. Place coverslips over the slides and allow them to dry.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Include positive and negative controls with each batch of slides
processed.
2. Ensure that proper staining is visible in the control slides before
interpreting patient results.
3. Document all quality control measures and results in the
laboratory logbook.
7. RESULT DOCUMENTATION AND REPORTING
1. Document staining intensity and distribution for each slide.
2. Record observations in the laboratory information system (LIS).
3. Verify that all results are reviewed and approved by a qualified
pathologist before final reporting.
8. REFERENCES
1. Manufacturer’s instructions for FGFR1 primary antibody and
detection systems.
2. Laboratory internal quality control policies.
3. Standard laboratory protocols for immunohistochemistry (IHC)
procedures.
This SOP is effective as of October 2023 and must be followed by all
laboratory staff performing the FGFR1 immunostain procedure for
technical component only. Any deviations from this protocol must be
documented and approved by the laboratory supervisor.
