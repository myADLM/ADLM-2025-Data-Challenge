Title: Protocol for the Analytical Phase of Generating Results for
FIBROLAMELLAR CARCINOMA, 19P13.1 (PRKACA)
Rearrangement, FISH, Tissue
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this document is to provide standardized procedures
for the analytical phase of generating results for Fibrolamellar
Carcinoma, 19p13.1 (PRKACA) Rearrangement using Fluorescence
In Situ Hybridization (FISH), on tissue samples. This ensures
consistency, accuracy, and reliability of results.
1. SCOPE
This protocol applies to all laboratory personnel responsible for
performing and analyzing FISH tests for Fibrolamellar Carcinoma,
19p13.1 (PRKACA) Rearrangement on tissue samples in a CLIA-
certified laboratory.
1. DEFINITIONS
Fibrolamellar Carcinoma (FLC): A rare type of liver cancer that
usually occurs in young adults. 19p13.1 (PRKACA) Rearrangement:
A specific genetic alteration associated with FLC. Fluorescence In
Situ Hybridization (FISH): A molecular cytogenetic technique that
uses fluorescent probes to detect specific DNA sequences.
1. RESPONSIBILITIES
• It is the responsibility of all laboratory personnel to follow this
protocol precisely.
• A designated pathologist or molecular biologist is responsible for
interpreting the FISH results.
• The laboratory director oversees the entire process to ensure
compliance with regulatory standards.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Acceptable: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue
blocks or freshly prepared tissue sections.
• Unacceptable: Poorly preserved tissue, insufficient tissue quantity,
or tissue samples with significant autolysis.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Fluorescent microscopes equipped with appropriate filter sets for
multiple fluorophores.
• FISH probe for PRKACA rearrangement.
• ThinPrep slides or tissue sections mounted on glass slides.
• Reagents for tissue pretreatment, hybridization, and post-
hybridization washing.
• Mounting medium containing DAPI counterstain.
• Control slides with known PRKACA status.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Slide Preparation
1. Deparaffinization: Bake FFPE tissue sections at 60°C for 1
hour, followed by deparaffinization in xylene and rehydration
through a graded alcohol series ending in water.
2. Tissue Pretreatment: Digest sections with enzyme solution to
expose target DNA.
3. Hybridization: Apply the FISH probe mixture to the tissue
sections, cover with a coverslip, seal and denature at 74°C for 5
minutes, followed by hybridization at 37°C for 16-18 hours.
B. Post-Hybridization Washing
1. Remove coverslip carefully.
2. Wash slides in a buffer solution to remove unbound probe.
3. Re-apply coverslip using an anti-fade mounting medium
containing DAPI.
C. Microscopic Analysis
1. Visualize the slides under a fluorescent microscope.
2. Use appropriate filters to detect the specific fluorescent signals.
3. Carefully evaluate the FISH signals within the target cells:
◦ Score a minimum of 200 interphase nuclei from non-
overlapping areas.
D. Interpretation of Results
1. Determine the presence or absence of PRKACA rearrangement
based on the signal patterns:
◦ Normal: Two fusion signals per nucleus.
◦ Rearranged: Split or atypical signal patterns indicate
rearrangement.
2. Record the number of positive cells and calculate the
percentage of rearrangement-positive cells.
E. Quality Control
1. Include positive and negative control slides in each run to
validate the assay.
2. Review any discrepancies in QC results with the supervisor or
pathologist.
3. Document all QC data and corrective actions taken in the
logbook.
4. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results are to be recorded in the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
• Generate a comprehensive report including:
◦ Patient identification.
◦ Specimen details.
◦ FISH probe details.
◦ Findings and interpretation (Presence or absence of PRKACA
rearrangement).
◦ Any pertinent comments about the quality of the specimen.
1. SAFETY PRECAUTIONS
• Handle all chemicals and reagents following OSHA guidelines.
• Use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) including
gloves, lab coat, and safety glasses.
• Dispose of all biohazardous waste according to institutional
protocols.
1. REFERENCES
• [Insert relevant references such as scientific articles, package
inserts for reagents, manufacturer's protocols for the FISH probe].
1. REVISIONS
• This SOP will be reviewed and revised annually or as needed to
ensure compliance with updated guidelines and practices.
