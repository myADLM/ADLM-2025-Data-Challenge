Protocol for Analytical Phase of Generating Results for
Fibronectin Glomerulopathy Confirmation via Mass
Spectrometry
1. Purpose
To outline the procedural steps for the confirmation of Fibronectin
Glomerulopathy (FNG) using mass spectrometry (MS) in a CLIA-
certified laboratory. This SOP ensures the accurate, precise, and
reliable identification of fibronectin anomalies characteristic of FNG.
2. Responsibility
Designated laboratory technologists and scientists are responsible
for performing the MS analysis as described in this procedure.
Supervisors are responsible for reviewing and validating the results.
3. Definitions
• FNG: A genetic kidney disorder characterized by abnormal
fibronectin deposits.
• Mass Spectrometry (MS): An analytical technique for measuring
the mass-to-charge ratio of ions, used for identifying and
quantifying various biomolecules, including proteins.
4. Specimen Requirements
Specimen type: Kidney biopsy tissue or other appropriate tissue
samples.
• Preferred Specimen:
◦ Fresh-frozen or formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE)
kidney biopsy samples.
◦ Samples should be handled and stored at -80°C until analysis.
• Unacceptable Specimen:
◦ Specimens that are not properly labeled
◦ Specimens that are degraded or improperly stored.
5. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies
• Mass Spectrometer (e.g., MALDI-TOF, LC-MS/MS)
• Microcentrifuge
• Proteomics Grade Reagents (e.g., Trypsin, Formic Acid)
• Protein extraction and purification kits
• Pipettes and disposable tips
• Vortex mixer
• Centrifuge tubes, microtubes
• Purified water (Milli-Q or equivalent)
• Pure solvents (Acetonitrile, Methanol)
• Matrix solution for MALDI-TOF (e.g., α-Cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic
acid)
6. Procedure
A) Sample Preparation
1. Tissue Homogenization:
◦ Homogenize approximately 5-10 mg of kidney biopsy tissue
in an appropriate lysis buffer (e.g., urea, thiourea-based
buffer) using a tissue homogenizer.
2. Protein Extraction:
◦ Centrifuge the homogenized tissue at 14,000 rpm for 20
minutes at 4°C.
◦ Transfer the supernatant containing extracted proteins to a
new microtube.
3. Protein Digestion:
◦ Reduce and alkylate the proteins using dithiothreitol (DTT)
and iodoacetamide (IAA) respectively.
◦ Digest the proteins overnight at 37°C using sequencing-
grade trypsin (1:50, enzyme: substrate ratio).
4. Peptide Purification:
◦ Purify the resulting peptides using C18 Zip-Tips or
equivalent solid-phase extraction technique to remove salts
and contaminants.
B) Mass Spectrometric Analysis
1. Sample Loading:
◦ For MALDI-TOF MS: Mix purified peptides with the matrix
solution and spot onto the MALDI target plate. Allow to dry.
◦ For LC-MS/MS: Load the purified peptides onto a reversed-
phase LC column for chromatographic separation prior to
MS analysis.
2. Mass Spectrometry:
◦ Perform the mass spectrometric analysis using the
appropriate settings for the MS instrument.
◦ Acquire spectra for peptide mass fingerprinting or tandem
MS for peptide sequencing.
C) Data Analysis
1. Data Acquisition:
◦ Identify and quantify the peptides using software compatible
with the MS instrument (e.g., Mascot, Proteome Discoverer,
MaxQuant).
2. Database Search:
◦ Search the acquired MS/MS spectra against protein
databases (e.g., UniProt, NCBI) to identify fibronectin and its
variants.
◦ Confirm the presence of mutations or abnormal isoforms of
fibronectin associated with FNG.
3. Results Compilation:
◦ Compile the identified peptides and proteins, focusing on
the presence and characterization of fibronectin.
D) Quality Control
• Ensure the calibration and maintenance of the mass spectrometer
as per manufacturer’s guidelines.
• Run quality control samples and blanks to monitor system
performance.
• Perform duplicate analyses for reproducibility.
• Validate peptide and protein identifications using appropriate
statistical thresholds.
7. Reporting Results
• Review and verify all identification and quantification data.
• Interpret the results in the context of fibronectin-related pathology.
• Compile a detailed report, including a summary of findings,
methodology, and any significant deviations.
• Submit the report for review by a supervising pathologist or
laboratory director before releasing results to the clinical team.
8. Reference Intervals
• N/A – Results are interpretative and must be correlated with
clinical and histological findings.
9. Method Limitations
• The accuracy of FNG confirmation is dependent on the quality of
the specimen and the proper execution of all procedural steps.
• Potential for false positives/negatives due to sample degradation,
insufficient peptide recovery, or anomalies not detectable by MS.
10. References
• Manufacturer's instructions for the MS system.
• Relevant peer-reviewed scientific literature on fibronectin
glomerulopathy and mass spectrometry protocols.
11. Revision History
• Document control page with a record of revisions and
endorsements by responsible personnel.
