STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE
FIBROTEST-ACTITEST, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedures for analyzing serum samples using the
FIBROTEST-ACTITEST to ensure consistent, accurate, and
reproducible results.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of designated laboratory personnel to perform
the FIBROTEST-ACTITEST analysis according to this SOP.
Laboratory supervisors are responsible for ensuring compliance and
addressing any deviations from the procedure.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENT
Preferred Specimen:
• 5 mL of serum collected in a SST (Serum Separator Tube).
Specimen Stability:
• Room Temperature: 8 hours
• Refrigerated (2-8°C): 24 hours
• Frozen (-20°C): 1 month
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed samples
• Samples with inadequate volume
• Samples received in tubes other than SSTs
• Samples not properly labeled
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Centrifuge
• Refrigerator (2-8°C)
• Freezer (-20°C)
• Spectrophotometer
• Pipettes and Tips
Reagents:
• FIBROTEST-ACTITEST reagent kit (manufactured by
Biopredictive)
• Calibrators and Controls
Supplies:
• SSTs (Serum Separator Tubes)
• Vortex mixer
• Sample tubes
• Labeling materials
4. CALIBRATION AND QUALITY CONTROL
Calibration:
• Perform calibration as per the reagent kit manufacturer's
instructions.
• Calibrate the spectrophotometer before the first run of the day
using the provided calibrators.
Quality Control:
• Run low, medium, and high controls at the start of each analytical
run.
• Document the control results and ensure they fall within the
acceptable range specified in the reagent kit package insert.
5. PROCEDURE
Sample Preparation:
• Allow serum samples to reach room temperature before analysis.
• Centrifuge SSTs at 1,500-2,000 x g for 10 minutes to ensure clear
separation of serum.
• Aliquot the clear serum to a labeled sample tube.
Reagent Preparation:
• Prepare reagents as per the manufacturer's instructions provided
in the reagent kit.
Analysis:
1. Pipette 200 µL of serum sample into the designated well on the
reagent plate.
2. Follow with a 200 µL addition of the working reagent mix
provided in the kit.
3. Mix gently by vortexing for 5 seconds.
4. Incubate the mixture at room temperature per the
manufacturer's specified time.
5. Measure the absorbance using a spectrophotometer set to the
wavelength specified by the kit (often 540 nm).
6. Record the absorbance values.
Calculation of Results:
• Use the calibration curve generated during the calibration phase
to convert absorbance into FIBROTEST and ACTITEST scores.
• Ensure to document and verify all calculated results.
6. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
Reference Ranges:
• Follow the reference ranges provided in the reagent kit or as per
the laboratory’s validated ranges.
Reportable Results:
• Normal: As per reference range
• Abnormal: Values outside the normal range should be highlighted
and flagged for further review.
Critical Results:
• Any results falling into the critical category should be reported
immediately to the requesting physician or healthcare provider
following the lab’s standard critical results protocol.
7. QUALITY ASSURANCE
Documentation:
• Record all steps, observations, and results in the FIBROTEST-
ACTITEST logbook.
• Ensure all deviations and corrective actions are documented.
Audit and Review:
• Regularly review the logbook for consistency and accuracy.
• Conduct periodic audits to ensure adherence to the SOP.
8. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS
• Handle all biological samples using appropriate PPE (Personal
Protective Equipment) following the lab's safety protocols.
• Dispose of all biohazardous waste according to regulatory
guidelines.

10. EXCEPTION HANDLING
• Any exceptions or deviations from this protocol must be approved
by the laboratory supervisor and documented with justification
and corrective action taken.
