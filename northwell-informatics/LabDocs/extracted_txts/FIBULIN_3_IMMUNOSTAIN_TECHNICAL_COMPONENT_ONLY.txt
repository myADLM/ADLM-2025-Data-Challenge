Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for FIBULIN 3
IMMUNOSTAIN, TECHNICAL COMPONENT ONLY
1. PURPOSE
To provide guidelines and procedural instructions for processing and
analyzing tissue specimens using the Fibulin-3 immunostain to
ensure consistent and accurate results. This procedure outlines steps
specifically for the technical component of generating Fibulin-3
immunostain results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
All qualified laboratory personnel are responsible for the proper
execution of this SOP. It is crucial for laboratory staff to follow the
detailed instructions and maintain documentation of all steps
performed in this process.
3. DEFINITIONS
• Fibulin-3: A protein used as a specific biomarker in certain
pathological diagnoses.
• Immunostain: A staining technique that uses antibodies to detect
specific proteins in tissue specimens.
• Technical Component: The part of the testing process that
involves the preparation and staining of the tissue specimen.
4. SPECIMENS
Preferred/Acceptable Specimen Types:
• Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks.
• Tissue sections mounted on positively charged slides.
5. REAGENTS AND MATERIALS
• Primary antibody: Fibulin-3 antibody.
• Secondary antibody: HRP-conjugated secondary antibody.
• Detection system: DAB (3,3’-Diaminobenzidine) chromogen.
• Counterstain: Hematoxylin.
• Wash buffer: Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).
• Mounting medium.
• Deparaffinization agents: Xylene.
• Ethanol series: 100%, 95%, 70%.
6. EQUIPMENT
• Microtome.
• Slide warmer.
• Staining jars or automated stainer.
• Humidity chamber.
• Light microscope.
7. PROCEDURE
A. Tissue Section Preparation
1. Sectioning:
◦ Cut 4-5 micron thick sections from FFPE tissue block using
a microtome.
◦ Place sections on positively charged slides and dry
overnight at 37°C or for 1 hour at 60°C.
B. Deparaffinization and Rehydration
1. Deparaffinization:
◦ Place slides in three changes of xylene for 5 minutes each.
2. Rehydration:
◦ Transfer slides through a series of ethanol solutions: 2
changes of 100% ethanol for 3 minutes, 95% ethanol for 3
minutes, 70% ethanol for 3 minutes, and rinse with distilled
water.
C. Antigen Retrieval
1. Heat-Induced Epitope Retrieval (HIER):
◦ Place slides in a suitable antigen retrieval buffer (e.g., citrate
buffer pH 6.0) and heat in a pressure cooker, microwave, or
water bath according to the manufacturer’s specifications.
◦ Allow slides to cool at room temperature and rinse in PBS.
D. Immunostaining
1. Blocking Endogenous Peroxidase:
◦ Incubate slides in 3% hydrogen peroxide in PBS for 10
minutes to block endogenous peroxidase activity. Rinse with
PBS.
2. Blocking Non-Specific Binding:
◦ Incubate slides with blocking buffer (e.g., 5% BSA in PBS)
for 20 minutes in a humidity chamber.
3. Primary Antibody:
◦ Tilt slides to remove excess buffer.
◦ Apply the Fibulin-3 primary antibody diluted according to the
manufacturer’s recommendations.
◦ Incubate in humidity chamber for 1 hour at room
temperature or overnight at 4°C.
4. Secondary Antibody:
◦ Rinse slides in PBS.
◦ Apply HRP-conjugated secondary antibody.
◦ Incubate for 30 minutes at room temperature in a humidity
chamber.
◦ Rinse slides in PBS.
5. Detection:
◦ Apply DAB chromogen solution to slides for up to 10
minutes or until the desired intensity is reached.
◦ Rinse slides thoroughly in distilled water.
E. Counterstaining and Mounting
1. Counterstain:
◦ Dip slides in hematoxylin for 1 minute.
◦ Rinse in running tap water until the sections are blue.
◦ Dip slides in 0.1% ammonia water to blue sections.
◦ Rinse in distilled water.
2. Dehydration and Clearing:
◦ Pass slides through ethanol series: 70% ethanol, 95%
ethanol, and 100% ethanol.
◦ Clear slides in xylene.
3. Mounting:
◦ Mount slides using an appropriate mounting medium.
◦ Cover slips should be applied and slides should dry
thoroughly.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Include positive and negative control tissues on every run to
validate staining.
2. Verify all test reagents are within their expiration dates and
prepared as per manufacturer’s instructions.
3. Perform regular maintenance and calibration of equipment.
9. INTERPRETATION AND DOCUMENTATION
1. Review stained slides under a light microscope and evaluate
the presence and intensity of Fibulin-3 staining.
2. Document all observations and ensure they are included in the
laboratory's reporting system.
