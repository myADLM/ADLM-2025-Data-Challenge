Standard Operating Procedure: Analytical Phase Protocol for
Generating Results for FIG (Ficus Carica) IgE
1. PURPOSE:
To provide a standardized protocol for the analytical phase of
generating results for FIG (Ficus Carica) IgE, ensuring accuracy and
reliability in patient test results.
2. SCOPE:
This procedure is applicable to all laboratory personnel involved in
the analysis of FIG (Ficus Carica) IgE using the designated
immunoassay analyzer system.
3. RESPONSIBILITY:
It is the responsibility of trained laboratory personnel to perform and
document all steps of the analytical procedures for FIG (Ficus Carica)
IgE testing. Supervisors are to ensure adherence to the protocol and
address any deviations.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES:
• Immunoassay analyzer with FIG (Ficus Carica) IgE assay
capability
• FIG (Ficus Carica) IgE reagent kit
• Quality control (QC) materials for IgE assays
• Calibrators for IgE assays
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
• Laboratory information system (LIS) for result entry and review
5. PROCEDURE:
A. Pre-Analytical Preparation:
1. Verify that all reagents, calibrators, and QC materials are within
expiration dates and stored properly.
2. Review and confirm that patient specimens are correctly
labeled and documented.
3. Allow reagents and samples to reach room temperature before
analysis.
B. Calibration:
1. Calibrate the immunoassay analyzer according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Use appropriate calibrators supplied with the FIG (Ficus Carica)
IgE assay kit.
3. Document calibration results in a Calibration Log.
4. If calibration fails, troubleshoot per manufacturer instructions
and repeat calibration.
C. Quality Control:
1. Run QC materials at low, medium, and high concentrations
before patient samples.
2. Document QC results in the QC log and review against
predefined acceptable ranges.
3. If QC results are out of range, do not proceed with patient
sample analysis until the issue is resolved.
D. Patient Sample Analysis:
1. Load patient samples and FIG (Ficus Carica) IgE reagents onto
the immunoassay analyzer.
2. Enter patient sample IDs and associated information into the
analyzer and/or LIS.
3. Start the analysis run, ensuring all steps are monitored for
proper function.
4. Upon completion of the run, review the raw data for any flags or
error messages.
E. Result Review and Verification:
1. Compare patient results with QC results to ensure assay
validity.
2. Verify that all patient results fall within the assay’s reportable
range. If any results fall outside this range, rerun the sample.
3. Document any required repeat analysis or troubleshooting.
F. Result Entry and Reporting:
1. Enter validated patient results into the LIS.
2. Review and verify reported results against patient identifiers to
ensure accuracy.
3. Release results for physician review once verification is
complete.
6. DOCUMENTATION:
• Calibration logs
• QC logs
• Patient result logs
• Instrument maintenance records
7. TROUBLESHOOTING:
Refer to the immunoassay analyzer’s user manual for
troubleshooting steps if issues arise during calibration, QC, or patient
sample analysis. Document all troubleshooting actions thoroughly.
8. SAFETY AND WASTE DISPOSAL:
Follow standard laboratory safety protocols and dispose of
biohazardous waste according to institutional and regulatory
guidelines.
