FILAMENTOUS-ACTIN (F-ACTIN) ANTIBODY, IGG, SERUM SOP
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this protocol is to outline the steps
necessary for the analysis and reporting of Filamentous-Actin
(F-Actin) Antibody, IgG, Serum results within the laboratory.
2. RESPONSIBILITY Designated laboratory technologists are
responsible for carrying out the procedure outlined below. It is
the responsibility of all laboratory staff to ensure that the
procedure is followed and any irregularities are reported to the
supervisor immediately.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES 3.1 Equipment:
◦ Microplate reader capable of measuring absorbance at the
appropriate wavelength
◦ Automated or manual pipette
◦ Incubator set at 37°C
3.2 Reagents:
• F-Actin Antibody IgG ELISA kit
• Deionized water
3.3 Supplies:
• Disposable pipette tips
• Microwell plates
1. PROCEDURE 4.1 Preparation:
◦ Ensure that the microplate reader is calibrated and
functioning properly.
◦ Set up a clean and sanitized workbench to avoid
contamination.
◦ Allow all reagents and serum samples to come to room
temperature before beginning the assay.
4.2 Sample Handling:
• Obtain the serum sample and ensure it has been properly labeled
and accessioned.
• If the sample has been refrigerated or frozen, ensure it reaches
ambient temperature before analysis.
• Mix samples gently prior to testing.
4.3 Assay Procedure: 4.3.1 Reagent Preparation
• Prepare all reagents as described in the F-Actin Antibody IgG
ELISA kit instructions.
• Wash buffer: Dilute concentrated wash buffer with deionized water
as per kit instructions.
• Sample diluent: Prepare the sample diluent as per kit instructions.
4.3.2 Sample Preparation
• Dilute each serum sample 1:100 in sample diluent unless
otherwise specified by the kit instructions.
4.3.3 Running the Assay
• Add the appropriate volume of diluted serum sample, calibrators,
and controls to the assigned wells of the microwell plate.
• Incubate the plate at 37°C for the specified time in the ELISA kit
instructions.
• Wash the microwell plate with the prepared wash buffer according
to the kit protocol.
• Add the enzyme conjugate to each well and incubate at 37°C for
the specified time.
• Wash the microwell plate again as described in the kit
instructions.
• Add the substrate solution to each well and incubate at 37°C for
the specified time.
• Stop the reaction by adding stop solution to each well.
4.3.4 Measurement
• Measure the absorbance of each well at the specified wavelength
using the microplate reader.
• Ensure that the microplate reader settings are correctly
configured to the ELISA kit requirements.
• Record the absorbance readings.
1. CALCULATION OF RESULTS
◦ Construct a standard curve from the absorbance readings of
the calibrators.
◦ Calculate the concentration of F-Actin Antibody IgG in the
patient samples by interpolation from the standard curve.
◦ Ensure that the results are presented in the units specified
by the ELISA kit.
2. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Ensure that all controls provided in the ELISA kit are run
with each batch of patient samples.
◦ The results of the controls must fall within the acceptable
ranges provided by the manufacturer. If control results do
not meet acceptance criteria, the assay must be repeated.
◦ Document all quality control results in the appropriate logs.
3. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ Review all results and verify the accuracy of data before
verifying results.
◦ Enter the calculated patient results into the laboratory
information system (LIS).
◦ Use standard reporting terminology and ensure results
conform to reference intervals.
4. TROUBLESHOOTING
◦ If absorbance values are outside expected ranges, or if
control results are unacceptable, refer to the troubleshooting
guide provided in the ELISA kit insert.
◦ Verify the integrity and expiration dates of reagents.
◦ Inspect the microplate reader functionality and calibration.
5. REFERENCES
◦ F-Actin Antibody IgG ELISA Kit Product Insert for detailed
assay instructions, reagent preparation, and limitations.
◦ Specific laboratory guidelines and manufacturer's
instructions to be adhered to.
6. DOCUMENTATION
• Record all assay details, including date, time, technician initials,
and sample accession numbers, in the assay log.
• Maintain proper documentation of quality control results,
instrument calibrations, and maintenance logs.
This SOP is effective immediately and should be followed without
deviation. All laboratory personnel are required to review and adhere
to this protocol.
