Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Analytical Phase for
Generating Results for FILARIA ANTIBODY (IgG4)
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standard procedure for the analytical phase of
generating results for FILARIA ANTIBODY (IgG4) testing in the
laboratory setting. This SOP ensures accurate and consistent results
through standardized techniques.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of designated laboratory personnel to follow this
SOP, perform all required steps accurately, and report results in
accordance with laboratory standards.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• ELISA Reader
• Microplate Washer
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Filariasis (IgG4) ELISA Kit
• Calibrators and controls
• Disposable gloves
• Timer
• Laboratory logbook
• Thermometer for ambient temperature monitoring
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen Type:
• Serum or Plasma (Lithium heparin, EDTA, or citrate
anticoagulant)
Specimen Stability:
• Specimens stored at 2-8°C are stable for up to 7 days.
• For long-term storage, specimens should be frozen at -20°C or
below and are stable for up to 3 months.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed specimens
• Specimens received in unapproved containers
• Specimens that have not been stored or transported according to
specified stability conditions.
1. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
• Bring all reagents, specimens, and controls to room temperature
before use.
• Consult the kit insert for detailed instructions on reagent
preparation.
Procedure Steps:
1. Label the required number of wells in the microplate for test
samples, controls, and calibrators.
2. Pipette 100 µL of each sample, calibrator, and control into
appropriate wells.
3. Cover plate and incubate at 37°C for 60 minutes.
4. Wash the wells 5 times with the washing solution using a
microplate washer.
5. Add 100 µL of enzyme conjugate (anti-IgG4) to each well.
6. Cover plate and incubate at 37°C for 60 minutes.
7. Wash wells again 5 times with the washing solution.
8. Add 100 µL of substrate solution to each well.
9. Incubate the plate at room temperature (20-25°C) for 15
minutes in the dark.
10. Add 100 µL of stop solution to each well.
11. Read the absorbance of each well at 450 nm using an ELISA
reader within 10 minutes of adding the stop solution.
12. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run positive and negative controls with each assay.
• Ensure the optical density (OD) values for controls fall within the
acceptable range specified in the kit insert.
• If the control values are outside the acceptable range, do not
report patient results and repeat the assay.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
Calculation:
• Calculate the mean OD values for each calibrator.
• Generate a standard curve by plotting OD values of calibrators
against their concentration.
• Use the standard curve to determine the concentration of IgG4 in
patient samples.
Result interpretation:
• Negative: Values below the cut-off determined by the kit insert.
• Positive: Values equal to or above the cut-off determined by the
kit insert.
Documentation:
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Record the date, time, and initials of the technologist verifying the
results.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Refer to the kit insert for specific cut-off values for interpreting
FILARIA ANTIBODY (IgG4) results.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the kit insert for potential limitations affecting the
performance of the assay.
1. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS
• Follow standard laboratory safety protocols.
• Wear appropriate PPE including gloves and lab coat during assay
procedures.
• Dispose of all biohazard waste according to the laboratory's waste
disposal guidelines.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING
Refer to the kit insert for guidance on troubleshooting common assay
issues. Consult the on-call supervisor for further assistance if
needed.
