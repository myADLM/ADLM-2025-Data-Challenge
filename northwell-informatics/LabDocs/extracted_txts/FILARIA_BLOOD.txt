Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for FILARIA, BLOOD
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized and reliable process for the analytical
phase of generating results for microfilariae in blood samples,
ensuring accurate detection and reporting.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of the laboratory personnel to perform the
analysis following the steps outlined in this protocol. Supervisors are
responsible for ensuring that staff adhere to the protocols and
perform quality control checks.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/acceptable specimen:
• 2-7 ml of whole blood collected between 10:00 pm and 2:00 am.
◦ The preferred collection method is via venipuncture into an
EDTA (purple top) tube.
◦ Blood should be mixed gently and remain at room temperature
until analysis.
Unacceptable specimens:
• Clotted blood samples.
• Blood collected outside the specified time range for microfilariae
detection.
• Samples that have not been properly labeled with the patient's
information and collection time.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• EDTA (purple top) collection tubes.
• Glass slides and cover slips.
• Micropipettes and tips.
• Thick and thin film spatulas.
• Giemsa stain and methanol.
• Timer.
• Microscope with appropriate magnification (100x - oil immersion).
• Immersion oil.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation of Thick and Thin Smears
1. Prepare thick and thin blood smears for examining microfilariae
in the following manner:
◦ Thick Smear:
▪ Place a large drop of blood (approximately 50-60 µl) on a
clean glass slide.
▪ Using a smooth-edged applicator or another slide,
spread the drop evenly in a circular motion to cover an
area of about 1 cm in diameter.
◦ Thin Smear:
▪ Place a small drop of blood (approximately 2-3 µl) near
one end of a clean glass slide.
▪ Hold another slide at a 30-45° angle to the drop and
spread the blood quickly and smoothly across the slide
to create a feathered edge.
2. Air dry the smears at room temperature. Do not use direct heat.
B. Staining
1. Fix the thin smear by placing it in methanol for 1 minute. Allow it
to air dry.
2. Stain both thick and thin smears using Giemsa stain:
◦ Dilute Giemsa stain with distilled water (1:10 dilution) and
stain the slides for 30-45 minutes.
◦ Rinse gently with buffered water (pH 7.2) to remove excess
stain.
◦ Allow the stained smears to air dry at room temperature.
C. Microscopic Examination
1. Place a drop of immersion oil on the stained smear.
2. Examine the thick smear under a microscope at 100x oil
immersion objective magnification, scanning systematically for
microfilariae.
3. Examine the thin smear similarly, focusing on the morphology of
detected microfilariae to identify the species present.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include known positive and negative control slides with each
batch of samples analyzed to ensure the staining and microscopy
process is accurate.
• Document and address any discrepancies or unexpected findings
promptly.
• Re-stain and review any smears with questionable results or upon
supervisor request.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Record findings, documenting the presence, quantity, and species
of microfilariae identified.
• Provide detailed observations in the laboratory information system
(LIS) for review and verification.
• Ensure that identified microfilariae species are consistent with
accepted morphological criteria.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Negative: No microfilariae detected.
• Positive: Microfilariae detected with quantity and species
identification, if applicable.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Sensitivity of detection may be limited by specimen collection
time, smear quality, and staining technique.
• Proper identification requires examining a sufficient sample
volume and following established criteria for distinguishing
microfilariae species.

• WHO guidelines on the laboratory diagnosis of filarial infections.
• Standard texts and atlases for the identification of microfilariae.
