Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analysis of Finch Feathers, IgE, Serum
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized and detailed procedure for the analysis of
Finch Feathers IgE levels in serum samples, ensuring accuracy,
precision, and reliability of results.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing and
documenting all steps in the analysis of Finch Feathers IgE in
serum.
• All staff are responsible for maintaining the integrity of the
analytical process and reporting any deviations to a supervisor.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/acceptable:
• 3-5 mL serum collected in a SST (Serum Separator Tube) or a
plain red top tube.
• Serum must be separated from the clot and transferred to a
labeled aliquot tube within 1 hour of collection.
• Store serum aliquots at 2-8°C if analysis will be performed within
72 hours; for longer storage, keep at -20°C or lower.
Unacceptable:
• Specimens that are hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric.
• Specimens that arrive in the laboratory more than 2 weeks after
collection without proper storage documentation.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Automated Immunoassay Analyzer (e.g., Phadia 250,
ImmunoCAP)
• Finch Feathers Allergens (IgE-specific reagents)
• Calibrators and Controls (Low, Medium, and High IgE
concentrations)
• Consumables: tips, sample cups, cuvettes, and reaction trays
• Laboratory timer
• Personal protective equipment (PPE): lab coat, gloves, and safety
goggles.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation:
1. Ensure that all reagents are brought to room temperature
before use.
2. Perform a pre-analytical check of the specimen for volume,
labeling, and integrity.
3. Vortex serum samples for 5 seconds before placing them into
the analyzer.
B. Calibration and Quality Control:
1. Perform instrument calibration using the IgE calibrators
provided with the assay kit.
2. Run low, medium, and high controls with each batch of
samples.
3. Verify that calibrator and control results are within the
manufacturer’s specified ranges before proceeding with sample
analysis.
C. Running the Assay:
1. Load serum samples, calibrators, and controls onto the
automated immunoassay analyzer following the manufacturer’s
instructions.
2. Initiate the IgE assay program specific to Finch Feathers
allergens.
3. Ensure that all sample and reagent volumes are sufficient and
appropriately assigned to avoid errors.
D. Result Review:
1. Upon assay completion, review control results to confirm assay
validity.
2. Ensure that all sample test results are within the analyzer's
linearity range. If a sample result is above the linearity range,
dilute the sample and re-run the test.
3. Document any dilution factor used for high-value samples in the
laboratory information system (LIS).
E. Troubleshooting:
1. If control results are out of range, review potential causes (e.g.,
reagent stability, calibration issues, instrument performance).
Recalibration and rerunning controls may be necessary.
2. Document any corrective actions taken in the QC log.
3. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results will be automatically uploaded to the LIS after validation
by the technologist.
• Confirm that results have been correctly transmitted and include
any necessary comments or dilution factors.
• Critical IgE results above the reference interval should be
reviewed, and appropriate clinical notification procedures should
be followed.
1. QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE
• Perform daily instrument maintenance checks.
• Document and review all QC data periodically as per laboratory
policies.
• Ensure all reagents and consumables are within expiration dates
and stored per manufacturer recommendations.
• Participating in proficiency testing for Finch Feathers IgE analysis
to ensure inter-laboratory comparability.

1. DOCUMENTATION
• Maintain records of all calibrations, QC, and patient results in LIS
and/or logbooks.
• Document all troubleshooting activities and corrective actions.
• Ensure proper storage and archiving of assay reports and quality
control records for regulatory compliance.
