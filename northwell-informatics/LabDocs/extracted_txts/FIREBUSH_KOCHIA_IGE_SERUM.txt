Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for FIREBUSH (KOCHIA), IGE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
To establish a standardized procedure for the analytical phase of
generating results for FIREBUSH (KOCHIA), IGE, SERUM in order to
ensure the accuracy, reliability, and timeliness of test results.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory technologists and personnel are responsible
for following this procedure and ensuring all necessary steps are
accurately completed. Supervisors are responsible for overseeing
adherence to this SOP and addressing any issues that arise.
1. DEFINITION
The FIREBUSH (KOCHIA), IGE, SERUM test measures the level of
Immunoglobulin E (IgE) specific to the Kochia plant in a patient's
serum to aid in the diagnosis of allergic reactions to Kochia.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
• Specimen Type: Serum
• Collection: Blood sample collected in an SST (Serum Separation
Tube)
• Stability: Serum separated within 2 hours of collection and stored
at 2-8°C. If testing is delayed, freeze serum at -20°C.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• Calibrated Immunoassay Analyzer
• SST tubes
• IgE specific reagents and calibrators
• Quality control materials
• Micropipettes and tips
• Vortex mixer
• Centrifuge (for serum separation)
1. PROCEDURE
A. Pre-Analytical Preparation
1. Specimen Handling:
◦ Ensure specimen tubes are correctly labeled with patient
information and accession number.
◦ Centrifuge SST tubes at 1500-2000g for 10 minutes to
separate serum.
◦ Transfer serum to labeled microtubes if not analyzed
immediately and store at 2-8°C or freeze at -20°C.
2. Equipment Preparation:
◦ Turn on the Immunoassay Analyzer and allow it to warm up
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Load reagents and calibrators onto the analyzer as per
manufacturer guidelines.
◦ Conduct daily maintenance and calibration checks
according to the manufacturer instructions.
B. Analytical Processing
1. Sample Loading:
◦ Load serum samples and quality control materials into the
analyzer according to the manufacturer's instructions.
◦ Verify and ensure correct tube positions and information on
the analyzer interface.
2. Test Execution:
◦ Select the FIREBUSH (KOCHIA), IGE, SERUM assay from
the analyzer's menu.
◦ Initiate the assay run. The analyzer will automatically
perform the test according to its protocol.
3. Quality Control:
◦ Run internal quality control checks with each testing batch
to ensure assay reliability.
◦ Review QC results before releasing any patient results. QC
results must fall within acceptable range as determined by
laboratory standards.
C. Post-Analytical Procedures
1. Result Validation:
◦ Review all generated results for accuracy and consistency.
◦ Verify and compare results against established reference
ranges.
2. Result Reporting:
◦ Document results in the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
◦ Inform the supervising technologist of any critical or
abnormal results immediately following laboratory policy.
3. Storage:
◦ Retain quality control logs, instrument calibration logs, and
equipment maintenance logs.
◦ Store serum samples per facility guidelines for potential
retesting.
Method Limitations: Refer to the Immunoassay Analyzer and
reagent kit insert for specific test limitations and interferences.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• The laboratory established reference interval for FIREBUSH
(KOCHIA), IGE, SERUM should be used to interpret results.
Consult specific Immunoassay Analyzer guidelines.
1. QUALITY CONTROL:
• Perform routine quality control checks following laboratory policy
using quality control material.
• Ensure all QC results are within the established control ranges
before reporting patient results.
• Document all QC procedures and follow-up on any discrepancies.
1. MAINTENANCE AND TROUBLESHOOTING:
• Follow daily, weekly, and monthly maintenance schedules for the
Immunoassay Analyzer
• In case of instrument failure or unexpected results, follow the
manufacturer’s troubleshooting instructions and notify a
supervisor if unresolved.
1. DOCUMENTATION:
• Maintain accurate records of all patient results, QC data, and
maintenance logs.
• Report and document any deviations from the SOP, including
corrective actions taken.
