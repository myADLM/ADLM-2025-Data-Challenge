Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Procedure for Measuring Fire Ant (Solenopsis invicta)
IgE in Serum
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the procedure for measuring specific
immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels against fire ant venom in human
serum using an immunoassay. The results will aid in the diagnosis
and management of allergic reactions to fire ant stings.
1. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel trained in immunoassay
techniques and involved in the analytical phase of testing for fire ant
IgE in serum collected from patients.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the trained laboratory technologist to perform
and document the test according to this procedure. Any deviations or
issues must be reported to a supervising technologist or laboratory
manager.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred Specimen:
◦ 5 mL of serum collected in a serum separator tube (SST).
• Specimen Stability:
◦ Serum is stable for 7 days at 2-8°C.
◦ For long-term storage, serum can be frozen at -20°C or lower
for up to 12 months.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Equipment:
◦ Microplate reader or automated immunoassay analyzer.
◦ Centrifuge.
◦ Pipettes and tips.
◦ Incubator.
• Reagents:
◦ Fire Ant Specific IgE reagent kit.
◦ Calibrators and controls provided with the kit.
• Supplies:
◦ Microtiter plates.
◦ Washing buffer.
◦ Substrate solution.
◦ Stop solution.
◦ Laboratory logbook or electronic laboratory information system
(LIS) for recording results.
1. PROCEDURE
2. Preparation:
◦ Allow all reagents, calibrators, controls, and patient sera to
reach room temperature before use.
◦ Label microtiter plate wells according to the layout plan for
standards, controls, and patient samples.
3. Assay Steps:
◦ Sample Addition:
▪ Add 50 µL of calibrators, controls, and patient serum
samples into designated wells.
◦ Incubation:
▪ Follow the incubation time and temperature as specified
by the reagent kit manufacturer.
◦ Washing:
▪ Wash the wells with wash buffer as per manufacturer’s
instructions, ensuring complete removal of unbound
substances.
◦ Enzyme Conjugate Addition:
▪ Add the enzyme conjugate to each well.
▪ Incubate for the specified time and temperature.
◦ Washing:
▪ Repeat the washing steps as instructed by the kit
manufacturer.
◦ Substrate Addition:
▪ Add the substrate solution to each well.
▪ Incubate in the dark for the specified time.
◦ Stopping the Reaction:
▪ Add stop solution to each well to halt the reaction.
4. Reading the Plate:
◦ Measure the optical density (OD) of each well using a
microplate reader at the wavelength specified by the kit
manufacturer.
◦ Record the OD readings for all samples, standards, and
controls.
5. CALCULATION AND RESULT INTERPRETATION
• Plot the calibration curve using the OD values of the calibrators.
• Determine the concentration of IgE for each patient sample based
on the calibration curve.
• Results are typically expressed in kilounits per liter (kU/L).
• Reference ranges:
◦ < 0.35 kU/L: Negative.
◦ 0.35 - 0.70 kU/L: Borderline.
◦ 0.70 kU/L: Positive.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run positive and negative controls with each assay to ensure
accuracy and precision.
• Record all control results and ensure they fall within the
predefined acceptable range.
• If control results are outside the acceptable range, do not report
patient results and initiate troubleshooting procedures.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Verify that all QC criteria have been met.
• Transmit the results to the LIS for review.
• Results should be reviewed and verified by the technologist
according to laboratory protocols before releasing to the clinician.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples may interfere with the
assay and should be avoided.
• High levels of heterophilic antibodies or rheumatoid factor in
patient samples could result in false-positive or false-negative
results.
