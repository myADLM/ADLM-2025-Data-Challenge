SOP: Generation of Results for FISH AND SHELLFISH PANEL
IgG
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to provide standardized procedures for
generating accurate and reliable results for the Fish and Shellfish
Panel IgG test using laboratory analytical methods.
1. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel involved in the
analytical phase of the Fish and Shellfish Panel IgG test in a CLIA-
certified laboratory.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
• Laboratory Technologists: Perform the Fish and Shellfish Panel
IgG test following the outlined procedures, ensuring all quality
control measures are observed.
• Supervisors: Ensure staff adherence to this SOP and address
any deviations or issues that may arise during testing.
• Quality Control Personnel: Monitor and document quality
control processes and take corrective actions when necessary.
1. DEFINITIONS AND ABBREVIATIONS
• IgG: Immunoglobulin G
• SOP: Standard Operating Procedures
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Fish and Shellfish Panel IgG Test Kits
• 96-Well Microtiter Plates
• Calibrated Micropipettes
• Pipette tips
• Plate Reader
• Incubator
• Washer
• Certified Calibration Controls (Positive and Negative)
• Plate Seals
• Distilled Water
1. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation
1. Ensure all samples have been collected, received, and
accessioned per specimen handling SOPs.
2. Bring all reagents and samples to room temperature (20-25°C)
before use.
3. Label microtiter plates according to the test plan.
B. Reagent Preparation
1. Prepare all reagents according to the manufacturer's
instructions provided with the test kit.
2. Reconstitute any lyophilized reagents with the appropriate
volume of distilled water.
3. Prepare wash buffer by diluting the concentrated wash solution
as specified.
C. Assay Procedure
1. Add 100 µL of diluent to each well.
2. Add 10 µL of the specific calibrators, controls, and patient
samples to the appropriate wells.
3. Mix the plate gently on a plate shaker for 1 minute.
4. Cover the plate with a plate seal and incubate at 37°C for 1
hour.
5. Wash the plate 5 times with the prepared wash buffer to
remove unbound material. Ensure no bubbles are present.
6. Add 100 µL of enzyme conjugate to each well.
7. Cover the plate again, and incubate at 37°C for 30 minutes.
8. Repeat the wash step as described in step 5.
9. Add 100 µL of substrate solution to each well.
10. Incubate the plate at room temperature (20-25°C) in the dark
for 10 minutes.
11. Add 50 µL of stop solution to each well to stop the reaction.
12. Measure the absorbance at 450 nm within 10 minutes of adding
the stop solution using a plate reader.
D. Quality Control
1. Run positive and negative control samples with each batch of
tests.
2. Verify that control results are within the established quality
control ranges.
3. Document all control results and investigate any out-of-range
controls before proceeding with patient sample analysis.
E. Calculation and Interpretation of Results
1. Subtract the blank well absorbance value from all test readings
before interpretations.
2. Generate a standard curve from the calibrators using the plate
reader software.
3. Calculate sample IgG concentrations based on the standard
curve.
4. Interpret results according to the kit insert guidelines and report
clinically significant findings clearly, following site-specific
reporting guidelines.
5. REPORTING RESULTS
6. Confirm the results before entry into the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
7. Notify the responsible clinician concerning any abnormal or
critical values as per laboratory policy.
8. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Reference ranges must be defined according to manufacturer
specifications and laboratory validation studies.
• Typically, IgG reference intervals are provided on the package
insert of the test kit.
1. LIMITATIONS
• Ensure no cross-contamination occurs during sample preparation
and processing.
• Follow kit instructions precisely to avoid inaccuracies.
• Highlight any potential interferences mentioned in the
manufacturer's instruction.
