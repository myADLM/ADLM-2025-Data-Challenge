FLECAINIDE, SERUM ANALYSIS PROTOCOL
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to provide standardized instructions
for the quantitative determination of flecainide concentration in serum
samples. Flecainide is an antiarrhythmic agent used in the treatment
of various cardiac arrhythmias. Accurate measurement of serum
flecainide levels is essential to ensure therapeutic effectiveness and
avoid toxicity. This procedure outlines the steps for sample
preparation, analysis, and result reporting.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of the designated staff to perform the flecainide
serum analysis following this protocol and to ensure accuracy and
precision of results through adherence to quality control procedures.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen:
• Preferred: Serum collected in a plain red-top tube.
• Acceptable: Serum separator tube (SST), ensuring the sample is
free from hemolysis.
Specimen handling:
• Centrifuge the sample and separate the serum from cells as soon
as possible.
• If analysis is not performed immediately, store the serum at 2-8°C
for up to 7 days.
• For long-term storage, freeze the serum at -20°C or below.
Unacceptable specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples should be avoided as they
may interfere with the analysis.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) system with
UV detector.
• Analytical column: C18 reversed-phase column.
• Mobile phase: A mixture of acetonitrile and water (30:70, v/v) with
0.1% formic acid.
• Flecainide standard: Prepare stock solutions and calibrators as
per manufacturer’s instructions.
• Internal standard: Appropriate for flecainide analysis, as
recommended.
• Quality control materials: Commercially available low, medium,
and high flecainide controls.
• Serum sample vials.
• Micropipettes and tips.
• Centrifuge.
• Vortex mixer.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation:
1. Thaw frozen serum samples if necessary.
2. Vortex the serum sample for 30 seconds to ensure
homogeneity.
3. Pipette 200 µL of serum into a clean microcentrifuge tube.
4. Add 50 µL of internal standard solution to the serum sample.
5. Add 250 µL of acetonitrile to the mixture to precipitate proteins.
6. Vortex the mixture for 1 minute.
7. Centrifuge at 14,000 rpm for 10 minutes.
8. Transfer the supernatant to a clean vial for HPLC analysis.
B. HPLC Analysis:
1. Set up the HPLC system according to manufacturer’s
instructions.
2. Equilibrate the column with the mobile phase at a flow rate of
1.0 mL/min.
3. Inject 20 µL of the prepared sample into the HPLC system.
4. Monitor the absorbance at the appropriate wavelength (e.g.,
254 nm).
5. Run the chromatographic method as per validated parameters.
6. Analyze the chromatograms to determine the retention time and
peak area of flecainide.
C. Calibration Curve:
1. Prepare a calibration curve by analyzing a series of flecainide
standards with known concentrations.
2. Plot the peak area ratios of flecainide to the internal standard
against the corresponding concentrations.
3. Use linear regression to generate the calibration curve and
determine the slope and intercept.
D. Quantitation:
1. Calculate the flecainide concentration in the serum sample
using the calibration curve.
2. Ensure all calculations are within the linear range of the assay.
3. QUALITY CONTROL
4. Analyze quality control samples (low, medium, high) alongside
each batch of patient samples.
5. Ensure QC results fall within established acceptance criteria.
6. If QC results deviate from acceptable ranges, troubleshoot and
resolve issues before reporting patient results.
7. Document all QC results and corrective actions taken.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
9. Enter the calculated flecainide concentration into the laboratory
information system (LIS).
10. Ensure results are reviewed and verified by the technologist
before release.
11. Critical values should be communicated to the appropriate
healthcare provider immediately following established
protocols.
12. REFERENCE INTERVALS
The therapeutic range for serum flecainide concentration can vary
based on the patient’s condition and clinical judgment. Generally,
therapeutic ranges are:
• Therapeutic range: 0.2-1.0 µg/mL
• Critical range: >1.5 µg/mL (requires immediate clinical
intervention)
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
2. Ensure samples are free from interfering substances (e.g.,
hemolysis, lipemia) that may affect the accuracy of results.
3. The presence of structurally related compounds or metabolites
may interfere with the analysis.
4. Adherence to proper sample handling and storage procedures
is crucial for accurate measurement.
