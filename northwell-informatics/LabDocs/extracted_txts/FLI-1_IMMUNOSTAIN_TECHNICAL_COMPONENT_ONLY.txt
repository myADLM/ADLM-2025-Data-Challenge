STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE: FLI-1 IMMUNOSTAIN,
TECHNICAL COMPONENT ONLY
1. PURPOSE
To outline the standardized procedure for performing the FLI-1
Immunostain test in the laboratory, ensuring accurate and reliable
results.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing the
FLI-1 Immunostain test following the procedures outlined in this
document. It is the responsibility of the laboratory supervisor to
ensure proper implementation and adherence to these procedures.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/Acceptable:
◦ Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue samples.
◦ Freshly prepared tissue sections on positively charged
slides.
Unacceptable:
◦ Specimens fixed in non-formalin fixatives.
◦ Specimen slides that are broken, overly thick, or poorly
processed.
2. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
◦ Microtome
◦ Automated Immunostainer or manual staining setup
◦ Light microscope
Reagents:
◦ Primary Antibody: Anti-FLI-1 (specific to human FLI-1)
◦ Secondary Antibody: HRP-Conjugated
◦ Detection System: DAB (Diaminobenzidine) Substrate Kit
◦ Mounting medium
Supplies:
◦ Positively charged microscope slides
◦ Coverslips
◦ Slide racks
◦ Washing buffer (PBS or TBS)
3. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Obtain FFPE tissue blocks and cut 4 µm sections using a
microtome.
2. Mount the sections on positively charged slides and air-
dry overnight at room temperature.
Staining Procedure:
1. Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
▪ Place slides in xylene (3 changes, 5 minutes each).
▪ Rehydrate through graded alcohol series (100%, 95%,
70%; 5 minutes each).
▪ Wash in distilled water for 5 minutes.
2. Antigen Retrieval:
▪ Perform heat-induced antigen retrieval in a suitable
buffer (e.g., citrate buffer) at 95°C for 20 minutes.
▪ Cool slides to room temperature and wash in PBS or
TBS.
3. Blocking:
▪ Incubate slides with blocking solution to reduce non-
specific binding (usually for 10 minutes).
4. Primary Antibody Incubation:
▪ Apply primary anti-FLI-1 antibody to tissue sections
and incubate according to manufacturer's instructions
(typically 30-60 minutes).
▪ Wash slides thoroughly in PBS or TBS.
5. Secondary Antibody Incubation:
▪ Apply HRP-conjugated secondary antibody and
incubate according to the manufacturer's instructions
(typically 20-30 minutes).
▪ Wash slides thoroughly in PBS or TBS.
6. Detection:
▪ Develop color using DAB substrate kit; monitor
development under microscope (typical incubation
5-10 minutes).
▪ Stop development by washing in distilled water.
7. Counterstaining and Mounting:
▪ Counterstain with hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes.
▪ Wash in running tap water, dehydrate through graded
alcohol series and clear in xylene.
▪ Mount with coverslip using appropriate mounting
medium.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
Internal quality control measures include:
• Positive control slides with tissue known to express FLI-1.
• Negative control slides with omitted primary antibody. Results
should be verified to ensure staining quality and specificity.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
Since this protocol covers the technical component only, the results
will be provided to the pathologist for interpretation and reporting.
Ensure all slides are properly labeled and documented.
1. REFERENCES
Refer to manufacturer’s instructions and product inserts for
antibodies, detection kits, and mounting mediums used during the
protocol.
NOTE: Ensure all personnel are proficient in immunohistochemical
staining techniques and familiar with the specific protocols and
instrumentation used in the laboratory. Follow all safety guidelines
and properly dispose of all waste materials.
