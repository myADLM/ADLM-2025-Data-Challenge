Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for
Generating Results for FLOUNDER
(BOTHIDAE/PLEURONECTIDAE FAMILY)
IgE testing
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedures for the accurate and timely analysis of
FLOUNDER (BOTHIDAE/PLEURONECTIDAE FAMILY) IgE testing
in clinical laboratory settings, ensuring quality and reliability of
results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of trained laboratory personnel to perform
FLOUNDER IgE testing according to this SOP, document results, and
carry out any necessary corrective actions.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
• Specimen Type: Serum from venous blood
• Collection Container: SST (serum separator tube)
• Volume: Minimum of 2 mL serum
• Stability: Store serum specimen at 2-8°C for up to 7 days or
frozen at -20°C for longer storage. Avoid repeated freeze-thaw
cycles.
• Unacceptable Specimens: Specimens that are hemolyzed,
lipemic, or improperly labeled
4. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Analyzer: Automated Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay
(ELISA) machine
• Reagents:
◦ FLOUNDER IgE ELISA kit
◦ Wash buffer, sample diluent, enzyme conjugate, substrate
solution, and stop solution as provided in the ELISA kit
• Supplies:
◦ Pipettes and pipette tips
◦ Microtiter plates
◦ Plate sealers
◦ Calibration controls
5. PROCEDURE
5.1 Preparation
1. Preparation of Reagents: Prepare reagents according to the
manufacturer’s instructions provided in the ELISA kit insert.
2. Calibration: Calibrate the ELISA analyzer as per
manufacturer’s guidelines. Ensure controls are within the
acceptable range.
5.2 Sample Processing
1. Sample Dilution: Dilute the serum samples appropriately
(recommended dilution factor: 1:20) using the provided sample
diluent.
2. Plate Loading: Add standards, controls, and diluted samples to
appropriate wells on the microtiter plate.
3. Incubation: Incubate the plate at room temperature for the time
specified in the kit insert (typically 60 minutes).
4. Washing: Wash the plate using the wash buffer provided to
remove unbound components as described in the kit insert.
5. Enzyme Conjugate Addition: Add enzyme conjugate to each
well and incubate further as per kit instructions.
6. Final Washing: Wash the plate again to remove excess
enzyme conjugate.
7. Substrate Addition: Add substrate solution to each well and
incubate until color development (usually 20-30 minutes).
8. Stopping Reaction: Add stop solution to halt the enzymatic
reaction.
5.3 Measurement
• Measure the absorbance at the specified wavelength (typically
450 nm) using the ELISA analyzer.
5.4 Calculation of Results
1. Standard Curve: Plot the absorbance against the
concentration of standards to generate a standard curve using
the analyzer’s software.
2. Sample Analysis: Calculate the concentration of FLOUNDER
IgE in each sample by comparing its absorbance to the
standard curve.
3. Quality Control: Ensure all controls fall within the acceptable
range. If controls fail, troubleshoot according to the
manufacturer’s guidelines before re-running the assay.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
• Result Documentation: Document all results in the Laboratory
Information System (LIS). Verify and review results before final
reporting.
• Reference Intervals: Report according to established reference
ranges for FLOUNDER IgE levels (normal range typically <0.35
kU/L; positive values vary based on clinical relevance).
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Internal QC: Perform quality control checks with each run using
both positive and negative controls provided in the ELISA kit.
• External QC: Participate in an external quality assurance
program to continually verify assay performance.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to ELISA kit insert for specific limitations regarding reagent
sensitivity and specificity. Ensure proper training and adherence to
procedural timings and environmental conditions to minimize assay
variability.
