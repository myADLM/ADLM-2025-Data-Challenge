Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: FLT3 Internal Tandem Duplication (ITD) and D835 Gene
Mutation Analysis
1. PURPOSE
This SOP provides the procedure for analyzing FLT3 Internal Tandem
Duplication (ITD) and D835 Gene Mutations in patient samples. The
procedure ensures accurate detection, interpretation, and reporting of
these mutations, which are critical for diagnosis, prognosis, and
therapeutic decision making in hematologic malignancies.
Responsibility:
Laboratory technologists are responsible for performing FLT3
mutation testing according to this SOP. It is the responsibility of the
supervisor to ensure all staff are trained and procedures are followed.
2. DEFINITION
FLT3 mutations include Internal Tandem Duplication (ITD), which
predominantly occurs in exons 14 and 15, and the D835 point
mutation located in exon 20 of the FLT3 gene.
3. PROCEDURE
Specimen Requirements:
• Preferred specimen: Bone marrow aspirate or peripheral blood in
EDTA or citrate vacutainers.
• Volume required: Minimum 5 mL.
• Temperature: Store samples at 2-8°C and process within 24 hours
of collection.
Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies:
• PCR instrument (e.g., Applied Biosystems 7500 Real-Time PCR
System)
• DNA extraction kit (e.g., Qiagen QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit)
• FLT3 ITD and D835 mutation detection kit
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes and tips
• Microcentrifuge tubes
• Ethanol 70-100%
• Nuclease-free water
• PCR reagents (including Taq polymerase, dNTPs, primers, etc.)
Protocol:
A) DNA Extraction:
1. Extract genomic DNA from bone marrow or peripheral blood
using the DNA extraction kit according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
2. Quantify and verify the purity of DNA using a NanoDrop
spectrophotometer or equivalent method. Target purity (A260/
A280) should be 1.8 - 2.0.
B) PCR Amplification:
1. Set up the PCR reactions for FLT3 ITD and D835 mutations
using the specific primers provided in the detection kit.
2. Prepare the reaction mix as follows:
◦ DNA Template: 50-100 ng
◦ Forward and Reverse Primers: As per kit instructions
◦ Taq Polymerase: As per kit instructions
◦ dNTPs: As per kit instructions
◦ Buffer: As per kit instructions
◦ Nuclease-free water: To final volume stated in kit
instructions
3. Run the PCR cycle using the following conditions:
◦ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 5 minutes
◦ Denaturation: 95°C for 30 seconds
◦ Annealing: As per kit instructions (60°C typically)
◦ Extension: 72°C for 1 minute
◦ Number of cycles: 35-40 cycles
◦ Final extension: 72°C for 10 minutes
4. Hold at 4°C until further analysis.
C) Detection by Gel Electrophoresis:
1. Load PCR products onto a 2% agarose gel containing ethidium
bromide.
2. Run the gel at 120V for 45 minutes.
3. Visualize under UV light to determine the presence of FLT3 ITD
and D835 mutations.
D) Interpretation:
1. Compare the bands in samples against positive and negative
controls.
2. A single band corresponding to the expected size indicates
wild-type; additional bands suggest duplication mutation (ITD).
3. Presence of shifted band against control indicates D835
mutation.
Quality Control:
1. Include positive and negative controls in each PCR run to
validate results.
2. Ensure DNA purity and concentration are within acceptable
limits before proceeding with PCR.
3. Periodic proficiency testing and instrument calibration should be
done according to lab schedule.
Reporting Results:
1. Record results in LIS.
2. Report findings as:
◦ Wild-type FLT3: No mutation detected
◦ FLT3 ITD mutation: Detected
◦ FLT3 D835 mutation: Detected
3. Include interpretation notes and any fixes applied due to
discrepancies.
Reference Intervals: Non-mutated (wild-type) FLT3 gene is
considered the normal reference. Any detected mutations are
significant and should be included in the final patient report.
Method Limitations: Refer to mutation detection kit insert for
specific limitations of the assay. PCR contamination and sample
quality can affect the accuracy of results.

mutation detection kits. Current literature on FLT3 gene analysis.
This SOP ensures accurate, efficient, and standardized testing for
FLT3 ITD and D835 mutations in clinical samples.
