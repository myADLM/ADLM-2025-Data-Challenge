FLT3 Mutation Analysis Protocol
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this protocol is to outline the procedures for
performing FLT3 mutation analysis on patient specimens. The
analysis will determine the presence or absence of FLT3
mutations, which are relevant for the prognosis and treatment
stratification of certain hematologic malignancies, including
acute myeloid leukemia (AML).
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of qualified laboratory personnel trained in
molecular diagnostics to perform the FLT3 mutation analysis
according to this protocol. Laboratory supervisors are
responsible for overseeing the process and ensuring
compliance with all procedures and quality control
requirements.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Acceptable Specimens:
◦ Bone marrow aspirate: Minimum 1 mL in EDTA (lavender
top) tube.
◦ Peripheral blood: Minimum 3 mL in EDTA (lavender top)
tube.
◦ Fresh or frozen tissue: Minimum 50 mg, stored at -80°C until
analysis.
Unacceptable Specimens:
◦ Specimens that are hemolyzed, clotted, or collected in
inappropriate containers.
◦ Specimens with insufficient volume.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
◦ Microcentrifuge
◦ Thermal cycler
◦ Real-Time PCR instrument
◦ Gel electrophoresis apparatus (if required)
◦ NanoDrop or equivalent spectrophotometer
◦ Vortex mixer
◦ Pipettes and tips
Reagents:
◦ DNA extraction kit (appropriate for specimen type)
◦ FLT3 ITD and TKD mutation detection kit
◦ PCR Master Mix
◦ Primers and probes specific for FLT3 ITD and D835
mutations
◦ Nuclease-free water
◦ Ethanol (optional for DNA purification steps)
Supplies:
◦ Microcentrifuge tubes
◦ PCR tubes or 96-well plates
◦ Gloves, lab coat, and other PPE
5. PROCEDURE
A. DNA Extraction
◦ Extract DNA from the specimen (bone marrow, blood, or
tissue) using the appropriate DNA extraction kit.
◦ Quantify the DNA concentration using a NanoDrop or
equivalent spectrophotometer.
◦ Adjust the DNA concentration to 50-100 ng/µL in nuclease-
free water.
B. FLT3 Mutation Analysis i. PCR Amplification for FLT3 ITD
and TKD Mutations - Prepare the PCR reaction mix as per the
manufacturer's instructions provided with the FLT3 mutation
detection kit. - Include appropriate positive and negative
controls. - Thermal cycling conditions: - Initial denaturation:
95°C for 3 minutes - 35 cycles of: - Denaturation: 95°C for 30
seconds - Annealing: 60°C for 30 seconds - Extension: 72°C for
1 minute - Final extension: 72°C for 5 minutes
ii. Detection of FLT3 ITD Mutations - Run the amplified
products on an agarose gel electrophoresis (if specified by the
kit instructions) or analyze via capillary electrophoresis. - Verify
the presence of internal tandem duplications (ITD) by
comparing the size of PCR products to controls.
iii. Detection of FLT3 D835 Mutations by Real-Time PCR -
Set up the Real-Time PCR reaction using specific probes for
the D835 mutation. - Run the Real-Time PCR on an appropriate
instrument and analyze the results using the software provided.
- A mutation is identified based on the amplification curves and
comparison to controls.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Perform DNA extraction, PCR, and mutation detection in
designated areas to avoid contamination.
◦ Include positive and negative controls in each run.
◦ Follow the manufacturers’ recommendations for the use and
expiry of reagents and consumables.
◦ Document all steps, observations, control results, and any
deviations from the standard protocol.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ Interpret the results based on the presence or absence of
ITD and D835 mutations.
◦ Record the results in the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
◦ If mutations are detected, include detailed interpretation and
recommendations for clinical correlation.
◦ Verify all results by a second qualified technologist or
supervisor before releasing the final report.
8. REFERENCE INTERVALS
◦ Mutation detected: FLT3-ITD positive, FLT3-D835 positive.
◦ No mutation detected: FLT3-ITD negative, FLT3-D835
negative.
9. LIMITATIONS
◦ Mutations other than ITD and D835 will not be detected by
this protocol.
◦ Poor specimen quality or low DNA yield may affect the
sensitivity and accuracy of the test.
◦ Sequencing confirmation may be required for ambiguous
results.
