Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Fluconazole (Diflucan)
Susceptibility Testing
1. PURPOSE
This protocol outlines the procedures for performing fluconazole
(Diflucan) susceptibility testing on clinical fungal isolates to determine
their susceptibility to fluconazole. The goal is to facilitate accurate
and reproducible results that can aid in effective treatment decisions.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all clinical mycology laboratory personnel who
will be performing fluconazole susceptibility testing.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Laboratory Supervisor: Ensures all laboratory personnel are
trained and competent in performing the procedure.
• Laboratory Personnel: Perform fluconazole susceptibility testing
according to this SOP, document results accurately, and report
aberrancies to the supervisor.
4. EQUIPMENT
• Incubator (set at 35°C)
• Spectrophotometer or visual reading device
• Sterile petri dishes
• Inoculating loops
• Microtiter plates or agar plates
• pipettes and pipette tips
5. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• Fluconazole powder or fluconazole discs
• Mueller-Hinton Agar supplemented with 2% glucose and 0.5 μg/
mL methylene blue for susceptibility testing or RPMI 1640 with
MOPS for broth microdilution method
• Sterile saline or broth for inoculum preparation
• Tween 80 (optional, dependent on inoculum preparation
protocols)
• Sterile water
• Quality control strains (e.g., Candida parapsilosis ATCC 22019,
Candida krusei ATCC 6258)
• Commercially available fungal Isolate
6. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation of Inoculum:
1. Subculture fungal isolates to ensure they are in the optimal
growth phase.
2. Prepare the inoculum by selecting colonies with a sterile
inoculating loop and suspending them in 5 mL of sterile saline
or broth.
3. Adjust the cell suspension to the turbidity of a 0.5 McFarland
standard using a spectrophotometer (530 nm) or visually by
comparison.
4. Dilute the adjusted inoculum to achieve the desired cell
concentration in the testing medium.
B) Agar Disk Diffusion Method:
1. Prepare Mueller-Hinton Agar plates with 2% glucose and 0.5
μg/mL methylene blue.
2. Inoculate the adjusted cell suspension onto the surface of the
agar plate using a sterile swab. Ensure even distribution.
3. Apply fluconazole discs to the agar surface, with adequate
spacing between each disc.
4. Incubate the plates at 35°C for 24-48 hours.
5. Measure the zone of inhibition around each disc and record
results.
C) Broth Microdilution Method:
1. Prepare RPMI 1640 with MOPS medium according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
2. Dispense 100 μL of the prepared medium into each well of a
sterile microtiter plate.
3. Prepare serial dilutions of fluconazole in the medium to achieve
a range of concentrations (e.g., 0.03 to 64 μg/mL).
4. Add 100 μL of the diluted inoculum suspension to each well,
achieving a final volume of 200 μL per well.
5. Incubate the plates at 35°C for 24-48 hours.
6. Read the MIC (Minimum Inhibitory Concentration), which is the
lowest concentration of fluconazole that inhibits visible growth.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Run control strains (e.g., Candida parapsilosis ATCC 22019,
Candida krusei ATCC 6258) alongside clinical isolates to
ensure valid results.
2. Experimental results must fall within established control ranges
for both methodologies.
3. Document all quality control results, and if controls are out of
range, troubleshoot and repeat testing as necessary.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Record and interpret susceptibility results according to the
established breakpoints (e.g., from CLSI or EUCAST
guidelines).
2. Enter results into the laboratory information system (LIS) for
verification and reporting.
3. Notify the requesting clinician of any potentially significant
findings directly, particularly if resistance is detected.

10. DOCUMENTATION
Maintain thorough documentation of all testing performed, including:
• Inoculum preparation details
• Quality control data
• Raw and interpreted susceptibility results
• Patient identification and accession number for specimen
tracking.
11. ANNEX
Detailed flow diagrams, acceptable ranges, troubleshooting guides,
and iterations of control reference ranges should be annexed to this
SOP. Specific user manuals for spectrophotometers and other
relevant assay-specific documentation should be referenced.
End of SOP
This SOP serves as a guideline for fluconazole susceptibility testing.
Laboratory staff should adhere strictly to this protocol to ensure
consistency and accuracy in test results. Any deviations or
inconsistencies should be documented and reported immediately for
corrective action.
