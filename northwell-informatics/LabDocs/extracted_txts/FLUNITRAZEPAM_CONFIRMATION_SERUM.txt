Standard Operating Procedure for Flunitrazepam Confirmation,
Serum
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedures for the confirmation of Flunitrazepam in
serum samples using Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-
MS). This protocol ensures reliable results for the detection and
quantification of Flunitrazepam, adhering to quality control standards
and reproducibility.
RESPONSIBILITY:
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing,
documenting, and reviewing all aspects of this analytical procedure,
including sample preparation, instrument operation, data analysis,
and reporting results. Supervisors are responsible for ensuring
compliance with SOPs and corrective actions if necessary.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen: Serum
◦ Collection: Blood should be collected in a red-top tube or
serum separator tube (SST).
◦ Processing: Allow the blood to clot for 30 minutes at room
temperature, then centrifuge for 10 minutes at 1500-2000 x g.
Carefully separate the serum from the clot.
◦ Storage: Serum should be stored at -20°C or lower until
analysis. Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
◦ Stability: Samples are stable for up to 3 months at -20°C.
Unacceptable Specimens: - Specimens with a significant proportion
(>10%) of hemolysis - Specimens with no collection date/time
indicated
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• GC-MS Instrument (Agilent 7890 GC coupled with 5977 MSD or
equivalent)
• Flunitrazepam standards and internal standard (deuterated
Flunitrazepam)
• Solid-phase extraction (SPE) cartridges
• Solvents: Methanol, Acetonitrile, Ultra-pure water
• Calibration curves and QC samples
• Vortex mixer, centrifuge, and glass vials
1. PROCEDURE
A) Sample Preparation:
1. Thaw serum samples at room temperature.
2. Pipette 1 mL of serum into a labeled tube.
3. Add 50 µL of internal standard solution (deuterated
Flunitrazepam) to each sample.
4. Vortex mix for 1 minute.
5. Perform solid-phase extraction using SPE cartridges:
◦ Condition cartridge with 1 mL methanol followed by 1 mL of
ultra-pure water.
◦ Load serum sample onto the cartridge.
◦ Wash the cartridge with 1 mL of ultra-pure water.
◦ Elute Flunitrazepam into a clean glass vial using 1 mL of
methanol.
6. Evaporate the methanol under a gentle stream of nitrogen at
40°C.
7. Reconstitute the residue in 100 µL of methanol and transfer to
an autosampler vial.
B) GC-MS Analysis:
1. Set up the GC-MS instrument and enter the method
parameters, including oven temperature program, carrier gas
flow rate, and MS settings.
2. Run calibration standards and QC samples to ensure the
instrument is producing accurate and reproducible results.
3. Inject 1 µL of prepared sample into the GC-MS.
4. Acquire and save chromatographic data.
5. Analyze and quantify Flunitrazepam using calibration curves
generated from standard solutions.
C) Data Analysis and Reporting:
1. Review chromatograms and spectra for each sample.
2. Verify retention time of Flunitrazepam and internal standard.
3. Quantify Flunitrazepam concentration in the serum sample
using the calibration curve.
4. Document findings and check for any discrepancies.
5. Confirm final results and review by senior personnel.
6. Input results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS) for
reporting.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
Internal QC:
• Run three levels of QC samples (low, medium, high) with each
batch of serum samples.
• Ensure QC results fall within acceptable limits before analyzing
patient samples.
External QC:
• Participate in proficiency testing programs periodically.
• Review and document external QC results.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
Results are transmitted to the LIS and must be reviewed and verified
by the responsible technologist before releasing to clinicians. Invalid
or questionable results should be flagged and reassessed.
Reference Intervals:
• The detection limit and quantification range will be as defined by
the validated method.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Detector saturation may occur at very high concentrations.
• Interferences from other benzodiazepines or metabolites should
be considered.
References:
• Protocol follows guidelines from relevant scientific literature and
manufacturer’s instructions for GC-MS setup and operation.
Review/Updates:
• Reviewed and updated periodically to ensure compliance with the
latest scientific standards and regulatory requirements.
