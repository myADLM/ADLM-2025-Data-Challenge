Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Fluoride,
Plasma Analysis
1. PURPOSE
To provide a detailed procedure for the analysis of plasma fluoride
levels to ensure consistent, accurate, and reliable results.
2. SCOPE
This procedure is applicable to all laboratory staff trained to perform
plasma fluoride analysis in a CLIA-certified laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
All designated laboratory personnel are responsible for following this
procedure. It is the responsibility of the supervisor/manager to ensure
all personnel are trained and adhere to this SOP.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type:
• Plasma collected in fluoride oxalate or EDTA tubes.
Specimen Volume:
• A minimum of 1 mL plasma is required for analysis.
Specimen Stability:
• Plasma specimens are stable for up to 7 days when stored at
2-8°C. For long-term storage, specimens can be kept at -20°C for
up to one month.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed samples.
• Specimens collected in tubes other than fluoride oxalate or EDTA.
• Specimens with visible clots or improper volume.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Ion-selective electrode (ISE) fluoride analyzer.
• Fluoride standard solutions.
• Fluoride Ion Strength Adjuster (ISA) reagent.
• EDTA or fluoride oxalate collection tubes.
• Calibrated pipettes.
• Centrifuge capable of reaching 3000 rpm.
• Specimen cups or tubes for analysis.
6. PROCEDURE
Specimen Preparation:
1. Centrifugation: Centrifuge the collected blood samples at
3000 rpm for 10 minutes at 4°C to separate plasma.
2. Transfer Plasma: Carefully transfer the supernatant plasma to
a clean specimen tube without disturbing the cell layer.
Calibration and Quality Control:
1. Calibration:
◦ Calibrate the fluoride ISE analyzer with standard fluoride
solutions (e.g., 0.5 ppm, 1.0 ppm, 2.0 ppm).
◦ Ensure the calibration curve meets the acceptance criteria
defined by the manufacturer.
2. Quality Control:
◦ Run high and low-quality control samples alongside patient
samples.
◦ QC results should fall within the established acceptable
range. If not, troubleshoot and recalibrate the instrument.
Sample Analysis:
1. Prepare Standards and Controls:
◦ Prepare the fluoride standards and quality control samples
as per manufacturer instructions.
2. Sample Measurement:
◦ Add 1 mL of plasma sample to the analysis cup.
◦ Add 0.1 mL of Fluoride ISA solution to the sample and mix
well.
◦ Measure the fluoride concentration using the ISE analyzer
as per manufacturer's instructions.
3. Documentation:
◦ Record the sample ID, date, time, and the initials of the
analyst for each test.
◦ Document the fluoride concentration reported by the
analyzer.
Post-Analysis:
1. Review and Verify Results:
◦ Technologists must review the results to ensure accuracy
and consistency.
◦ Document any deviations or anomalies detected during the
analysis process.
2. Specimen Retention:
◦ Store leftover plasma samples at 2-8°C for at least 7 days
post-analysis in case of retesting.
3. Reporting:
◦ Upload the results to the Laboratory Information System
(LIS) for further verification and validation by the
technologist.
◦ Ensure the approved results are communicated to the
appropriate healthcare provider promptly.
7. QUALITY CONTROL AND TROUBLESHOOTING
1. If quality control results are outside the acceptable range:
◦ Reanalyze the QC samples.
◦ Check instrument calibration, reagents, and procedure
adherence.
◦ If issues persist, escalate to the supervisor and follow
manufacturer's troubleshooting guide.
2. Instrument Maintenance:
◦ Perform daily, weekly, and monthly maintenance checks as
specified by the instrument manufacturer.
◦ Document all maintenance activities.
