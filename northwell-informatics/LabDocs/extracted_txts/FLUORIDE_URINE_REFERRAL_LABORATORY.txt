Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase Protocol for FLUORIDE, URINE REFERRAL
LABORATORY
Purpose: To outline the procedure for the analytical phase of
generating results for fluoride in urine samples sent to a referral
laboratory, ensuring accurate and timely results.
Scope: This SOP applies to all personnel involved in the processing,
analysis, and reporting of fluoride in urine samples in the designated
CLIA-certified laboratory.
Responsibility:
• Laboratory Technicians: Responsible for preparing and
processing samples as per this SOP.
• Laboratory Scientists: Responsible for analyzing the samples and
generating the results.
• Supervisors: Responsible for overseeing the process, ensuring
the accuracy of results, addressing any issues, and reporting.
Materials and Equipment:
1. Fluoride-specific ion-selective electrode (ISE) or equivalent
analytical equipment.
2. Reagents for fluoride analysis as specified by the assay
protocol.
3. Centrifuge
4. pH meter
5. Calibration standards
6. Quality control materials
7. Safety equipment (gloves, lab coats, eyewear)
8. Collection tubes containing specimens.
Specimen Requirements and Stability:
Specimen:
1. Preferred/acceptable:
• Freshly collected urine in a sterile container, stored at 4°C and
analyzed within 72 hours.
• Urine samples in fluoride preservative vials, stable for up to 14
days at 4°C.
1. Unacceptable:
• Urine samples received more than 72 hours after collection
without a preservative.
• Specimens lacking proper identification or collection date/time.
• Contaminated, hemolyzed, or visibly deteriorated specimens.
Procedure:
1. Sample Preparation:
◦ Verify that each sample has proper identification and
relevant information.
◦ Document the receipt of samples in the laboratory
information system (LIS).
◦ Centrifuge the urine samples at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes to
remove particulates if needed.
◦ Adjust the pH of the urine sample to between 5 and 6 using
dilute acid or sodium hydroxide, if necessary.
2. Calibration of Analytical Equipment:
◦ Prepare fluoride calibration standards as per manufacturer's
instructions.
◦ Calibrate the fluoride-specific ion-selective electrode (ISE)
before use.
◦ Verify the calibration using quality control standards.
3. Sample Analysis:
◦ Place a measured aliquot (according to the specific assay)
of the urine into a clean, labeled analysis container.
◦ Add the appropriate reagent or buffer as per the assay
protocol.
◦ Immerse the fluoride ISE into the sample, ensuring it is
submerged properly.
◦ Allow the electrode to stabilize for the recommended time to
achieve a steady reading.
◦ Record the fluoride concentration indicated by the ISE.
4. Quality Control:
◦ Run quality control samples (low, medium, and high fluoride
concentrations) with each batch of tests.
◦ Compare results with established control ranges.
◦ If control results are outside acceptable limits, do not report
patient results. Recalibrate the instrument and reanalyze
both the controls and patient samples.
5. Result Recording:
◦ Enter the fluoride concentrations obtained into the LIS.
◦ Verify the results by reviewing them against known control
values and ensuring there are no clerical errors.
◦ Validate and release the results only after ensuring all QC
criteria are met.
Reporting Results:
• Results are automatically transmitted to the LIS and must be
reviewed and verified.
• Document any critical values following the laboratory’s policy.
• Notify the referring physician of any critical results immediately.
• Ensure that all results are documented accurately and securely.
Sample Integrity and Troubleshooting:
• In case of questionable sample integrity, centrifuge an aliquot to
check for issues such as hemolysis or contamination.
• Investigate and document any discrepancies or issues
encountered during testing.
• Repeat the analysis if necessary, and compare findings to ensure
consistency.
References:
• Manufacturer’s instrument and reagent inserts and manuals.
• CLIA guidelines for laboratory processes and quality control.
• Laboratory’s internal quality and testing protocols.
Quality Assurance and Safety:
• Follow all laboratory safety protocols and ensure the proper
disposal of biohazardous materials.
• Maintain records of all maintenance and calibration activities of
the fluoride ISE.
• Participate in regular proficiency testing as required by CLIA.
By adhering to this SOP, the laboratory ensures the accuracy,
reliability, and timely reporting of fluoride urine test results,
maintaining high standards of patient care and compliance with
regulatory requirements.
