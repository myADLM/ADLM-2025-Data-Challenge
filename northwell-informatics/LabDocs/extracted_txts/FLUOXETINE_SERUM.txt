Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Fluoxetine, Serum
1. PURPOSE
To ensure the accurate measurement and reporting of Fluoxetine
levels in serum samples using high-performance liquid
chromatography (HPLC) coupled with mass spectrometry (MS) in a
clinical laboratory setting.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of designated laboratory staff to perform the
analysis and to ensure that all procedures are followed as outlined in
this document. It is also the responsibility of the laboratory
supervisors to ensure that appropriate training is provided and that
quality control measures are followed.
1. DEFINITION
Fluoxetine is an antidepressant of the selective serotonin reuptake
inhibitor (SSRI) class. The analysis of Fluoxetine levels in serum is
critical for therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) to ensure efficacy and
avoid toxicity.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
Equipment:
• HPLC System
• Mass Spectrometer (MS)
• Analytical balance
• Centrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Volumetric flasks
• Pipettes and tips
Reagents:
• HPLC-grade water
• HPLC-grade acetonitrile
• Formic acid
• Fluoxetine standard
• Internal standard (IS)
• Serum samples
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Preferred Specimen:
• 5 mL of serum collected in a serum separator tube (SST).
Stability:
• Serum should be separated from cells within 2 hours of collection.
• Store serum samples at 2-8°C for up to 7 days or at -20°C for
longer storage.
1. QUALITY CONTROL MATERIALS
Quality control materials (QC levels: low, medium, and high) should
be included in each run to ensure the accuracy and precision of the
analytical method.
1. PROCEDURE
A) Sample Preparation:
1. After receiving and accessioning the serum samples, thaw
frozen samples at room temperature. Mix thoroughly by gently
inverting.
2. Centrifuge the samples at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes to remove
any precipitates.
3. Aliquot 100 µL of serum into a labeled microcentrifuge tube.
4. Add 10 µL of the internal standard (IS) solution to each tube.
5. Vortex mix the tubes for 30 seconds.
6. Add 300 µL of acetonitrile to precipitate proteins.
7. Vortex mix the tubes for 1 minute.
8. Centrifuge at 12000 rpm for 10 minutes.
B) HPLC-MS Analysis:
1. Set up the HPLC-MS system according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
2. Prepare the mobile phase: 0.1% formic acid in water (Solvent
A) and 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile (Solvent B).
3. Equilibrate the HPLC column with the initial mobile phase
composition.
4. Inject 10 µL of the supernatant from the sample preparation
step into the HPLC system.
5. Follow the gradient elution program as specified:
◦ 0 to 2 minutes: 10% B
◦ 2 to 8 minutes: 10% to 90% B
◦ 8 to 10 minutes: 90% to 10% B
6. Analyze the samples using the mass spectrometer set with
selected reaction monitoring (SRM) for Fluoxetine and IS.
C) Data Analysis and Results Calculation:
1. Process the chromatographic data using appropriate software.
2. Quantify the concentration of Fluoxetine by comparing the peak
area ratio of Fluoxetine to IS with that of calibration standards.
3. Ensure all quality control samples meet the predefined criteria.
4. REPORTING RESULTS
Results are reported in ng/mL. Technologists must review and verify
all results before releasing them to the laboratory information system
(LIS).
Reference Intervals:
• Therapeutic range: 50 - 400 ng/mL
• Toxic level: > 500 ng/mL
1. QUALITY CONTROL AND METHOD LIMITATIONS
A) Quality Control:
Conduct QC for each new batch of reagents and each analytical run:
• Three QC levels (low, medium, high) must be analyzed in each
batch.
• Acceptable ranges for QC are predetermined, and QC results
must fall within these ranges for the batch to be valid.
B) Method Limitations:
Ensure to refer to the manufacturer’s instructions and insert for
limitations such as interfering substances, cross-reactivity, and
expected method performance characteristics (e.g., sensitivity and
specificity).
