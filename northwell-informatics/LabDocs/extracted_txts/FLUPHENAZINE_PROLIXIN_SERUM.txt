Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Fluphenazine (Prolixin), Serum
1. Purpose
To provide a standardized procedure for the accurate and reliable
measurement of fluphenazine (Prolixin) levels in serum samples,
utilizing liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/
MS). This protocol ensures consistency, accuracy, and precision in
analytical results, thereby supporting effective clinical decision-
making.
1. Scope
This SOP applies to all staff trained in the operation of LC-MS/MS
and involved in the measurement of fluphenazine in serum samples
within the laboratory.
1. Responsibilities
• Laboratory personnel are responsible for adhering to this SOP
and ensuring that all quality control measures are followed.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring staff competency in this
procedure and for reviewing and approving results.
• Equipment maintenance staff are responsible for calibrating and
maintaining the LC-MS/MS equipment according to the
manufacturer’s guidelines.
1. Specimen Requirements
• Preferred Specimen Type: Serum.
• Volume: Minimum 2 mL.
• Collection Containers: Red-top tube or serum separator tube
(SST).
• Stability: Specimens should be stored at 2-8°C if analyzed within
7 days. For longer storage, freeze at -20°C.
1. Reagents and Supplies
• Mobile Phase A: Water with 0.1% formic acid.
• Mobile Phase B: Acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid.
• Fluphenazine standard solution.
• Internal standard solution.
• Calibration standards and quality control samples.
• LC-MS/MS system.
• Sample vials and caps.
1. Instrumentation
• Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/
MS).
• LC column suitable for the separation of fluphenazine.
1. Procedure
7.1. Sample Preparation
1. Allow frozen serum samples to thaw at room temperature.
2. Vortex each sample for 30 seconds.
3. Aliquot 200 µL of serum into a labeled sample vial.
4. Add 20 µL of internal standard solution to each vial.
5. Vortex for 30 seconds to mix thoroughly.
6. Add 800 µL of acetonitrile to precipitate proteins.
7. Vortex for 1 minute.
8. Centrifuge samples at 10,000 RPM for 10 minutes at 4°C.
9. Transfer the supernatant into a clean sample vial.
10. Evaporate to dryness under nitrogen at 40°C.
11. Reconstitute the residue in 200 µL of mobile phase (A:B =
50:50).
12. Vortex and transfer the solution to autosampler vials.
7.2. Instrument Setup and Calibration
1. Perform a system check of the LC-MS/MS.
2. Load the calibration standards, quality control samples, and
prepared serum samples into the autosampler.
3. Set the LC gradient conditions as follows:
◦ Initial: 95% Mobile Phase A, 5% Mobile Phase B.
◦ Gradually increase to 70% Mobile Phase B over 10 minutes.
◦ Hold for 2 minutes.
◦ Return to initial conditions and equilibrate for 5 minutes.
4. Set MS/MS parameters for fluphenazine and internal standard
detection.
5. Perform system calibration with calibration standards.
7.3. Sample Analysis
1. Inject 10 µL of each sample into the LC-MS/MS system.
2. Analyze samples according to the programmed method.
3. Ensure that the retention times for fluphenazine and internal
standard are consistent.
4. Quantify the concentration of fluphenazine using the calibration
curve.
7.4. Quality Control
1. Include at least two levels (low and high) of quality control
samples in each analytical run.
2. Evaluate QC results against established control limits before
releasing patient results.
3. If QC results fall outside the acceptable range, troubleshoot and
repeat the analysis.
7.5. Data Review and Reporting
1. Review the chromatograms for peak shape, retention times,
and any anomalies.
2. Review the quantitative results for consistency and accuracy.
3. Input results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
4. Report results including any necessary comments or
disclaimers related to sample integrity or analysis.
5. Troubleshooting
• If issues arise with peak retention time, check the mobile phase
composition and column condition.
• For low or inconsistent signal, verify the tuning of the mass
spectrometer and the cleanliness of the ion source.
• Document and report any persistent issues to the supervisor.
1. Documentation
• Record all temperatures, times, and instrument settings in the
appropriate logbooks.
• Document any deviations from standard procedure and corrective
actions taken.
• Store all raw data, chromatograms, and QC results as per the
laboratory’s record-keeping policy.
1. References
• Manufacturer’s manual for LC-MS/MS system.
• Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) Guidelines.
• Latest literature on fluphenazine (Prolixin) serum level
measurement techniques.
