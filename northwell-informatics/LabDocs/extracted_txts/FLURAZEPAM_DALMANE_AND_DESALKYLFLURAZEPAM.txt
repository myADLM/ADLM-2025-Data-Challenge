Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Generation of Analytical Results for Flurazepam (Dalmane) and
Desalkylflurazepam
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedure for the analysis
and reporting of Flurazepam (Dalmane) and Desalkylflurazepam in
the laboratory. This includes sample preparation, instrumental
analysis, quality control, and results reporting.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of all designated laboratory personnel to
perform and document the procedure accurately. Supervisors are
responsible for ensuring that all staff are trained and comply with this
SOP.
2. DEFINITIONS
• Flurazepam (Dalmane): A benzodiazepine used as a hypnotic.
• Desalkylflurazepam: An active metabolite of Flurazepam.
• SPE: Solid Phase Extraction.
• GC-MS: Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry.
• LIS: Laboratory Information System.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Serum or plasma.
• Volume: Minimum of 2 mL of serum/plasma.
• Collection: Blood should be collected in a red-top vacutainer
tube or tubes with anticoagulant. If using anticoagulant, sodium
heparin or lithium heparin is preferred.
• Stability: Specimens should be kept at 2-8°C and analyzed within
7 days of collection. Longer storage should be at -20°C.
4. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• Solid Phase Extraction (SPE) columns
• Organic solvents (e.g., methanol, acetonitrile)
• Internal standard
• Flurazepam and Desalkylflurazepam reference standards
• Reagent grade water
• SPE conditioning reagents
• Nitrogen gas for drying
• GC-MS system with appropriate columns and carrier gases
5. EQUIPMENT
• Centrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Refrigerator/freezer
• Water bath or dry heat block
• GC-MS
• Analytical balance
• pH meter
6. PROCEDURE
A) Sample Preparation
1. Serum/Plasma Separation:
◦ Centrifuge blood samples at 1,500 g for 10 minutes at 4°C.
◦ Transfer the serum/plasma into labeled polypropylene
tubes.
2. Extraction:
◦ Condition SPE columns with methanol, followed by reagent
grade water.
◦ Load 1 mL of serum/plasma sample onto the SPE column.
◦ Wash the column with water followed by a suitable wash
solvent (usually a methanol-water mix).
◦ Elute Flurazepam and Desalkylflurazepam from the SPE
column with an organic solvent (typically methanol).
◦ Evaporate the eluate to dryness under a stream of nitrogen
gas.
◦ Reconstitute the residue in an appropriate solvent (usually a
small volume of methanol).
3. Internal Standard Addition:
◦ Add a known quantity of internal standard to each
reconstituted sample for quantification calibration.
B) Instrumental Analysis
1. GC-MS Setup:
◦ Ensure the GC-MS system is calibrated and the appropriate
column is installed.
◦ Set the temperature program and injection parameters as
per the manufacturer's recommendations.
2. Injection and Detection:
◦ Inject an aliquot of the reconstituted sample into the GC-MS.
◦ Use selective ion monitoring (SIM) mode to quantify
Flurazepam and Desalkylflurazepam.
C) Data Analysis and Calculation
1. Quantification:
◦ Analyze the chromatograms to identify and quantify
Flurazepam and Desalkylflurazepam relative to the internal
standard using a calibration curve generated from reference
standards.
D) Quality Control
1. Control Samples:
◦ Run control samples (both positive controls with known
concentrations and negative controls) with each batch of
test samples to ensure accuracy and precision.
◦ Acceptable control limits should be predefined and
documented.
2. Reproducibility:
◦ Duplicate analysis should be performed periodically to
assess reproducibility.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Result Documentation:
◦ Enter the results into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
◦ Verify the results by the technologist before reporting.
2. Results Reporting:
◦ Report the concentrations of Flurazepam and
Desalkylflurazepam in ng/mL.
◦ Include appropriate comments or interpretations if
necessary based on the concentration levels.
3. Reference Intervals:
◦ Establish reference intervals based on internal validation
and literature.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Possible interferences from other benzodiazepines or metabolites
should be identified and accounted for in the GC-MS settings.
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples may affect the results and
should be noted on the laboratory report.
9. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's instructions for the GC-MS.
• Relevant literature on the pharmacokinetics and detection of
Flurazepam and Desalkylflurazepam.
10. APPENDICES
• Calibration curves.
• Validation data for the SOP.
Review and Revision History:
• Reviewed annually or as needed for accuracy and compliance.

Ensure all steps are followed meticulously to obtain accurate and
reproducible results. This SOP should be available for all staff
involved in the analysis process and reviewed periodically.
