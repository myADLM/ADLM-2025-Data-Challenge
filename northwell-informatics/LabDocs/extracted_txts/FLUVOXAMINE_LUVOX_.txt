Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Fluvoxamine (Luvox)
1. PURPOSE:
This SOP provides detailed instructions for the analysis and
generation of results for Fluvoxamine (Luvox) in patient
specimens. It ensures standardized procedures are followed,
maintaining the accuracy and reliability of test results.
2. SCOPE:
This procedure applies to the analysis of Fluvoxamine levels in
patient serum or plasma samples using the designated
analytical instruments and methodologies in the CLIA-certified
laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY:
◦ It is the responsibility of the laboratory technologist to
perform the analysis following this SOP and to document all
steps accurately.
◦ Supervisors are responsible for verifying the accuracy of
results, maintaining test equipment, and ensuring all
procedures adhere to prescribed guidelines.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS:
◦ Preferred Specimen: Serum or plasma.
◦ Collection Tube: Serum (red-top) or plasma (lavender-top
[EDTA] or green-top [heparin]).
◦ Volume: A minimum of 2 mL of serum/plasma is required.
◦ Handling: Centrifuge blood samples and separate serum/
plasma from cells within 2 hours of collection. Store samples
at 2-8°C if analysis will be performed within 72 hours;
otherwise, samples should be frozen at -20°C or below.
5. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES:
◦ High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) system
with UV detector or equivalent analytical system.
◦ Fluvoxamine standard solutions.
◦ Reagent-grade methanol, acetonitrile, and water (all HPLC-
grade).
◦ Solid phase or liquid-liquid extraction columns (if
applicable).
◦ Pipettes, centrifuge, and other standard laboratory
equipment.
6. REAGENTS PREPARATION:
◦ Mobile Phase: Prepare a mixture of acetonitrile and water
(60:40 v/v) with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Filter and degas
the mobile phase before use.
◦ Standard Solution: Prepare a stock solution of
Fluvoxamine (1000 μg/mL). Serially dilute the stock solution
with methanol to obtain working standards of 10, 50, 100,
200, and 500 ng/mL.
7. CALIBRATION AND QC MATERIALS:
◦ Calibration Curve: Use prepared working standards to
construct a calibration curve. Each run should include a
blank, low, medium, and high control sample.
◦ Quality Control: Prepare one set of low (50 ng/mL),
medium (150 ng/mL), and high (400 ng/mL) quality control
samples from pooled serum/plasma free of Fluvoxamine.
8. PROCEDURE:
8.1 Sample Preparation:
- Thaw frozen samples at room temperature.
- Add 200 µL of sample, standard, or control into labeled microcentrifuge tubes.
- If using extraction columns, follow manufacturer’s protocol for extraction of Fluvoxamine, eluting with methanol.
- Evaporate the solvent under a stream of nitrogen.
- Reconstitute the dried extract with 100 µL of the mobile phase.
8.2 Instrument Setup:
- Set up the HPLC system with the appropriate column (e.g., C18 reversed-phase column) and mobile phase.
- Set the UV detector to 254 nm for UV detection.
- Ensure the system is equilibrated with the mobile phase before injection.
8.3 Sample Analysis:
- Inject 20 µL of each calibrator, quality control sample, and patient specimen into the HPLC system.
- Record chromatograms, ensuring clear resolution of Fluvoxamine peaks and no interfering substances.
- Compare retention times and peak areas of samples with those of standards.
9. CALCULATIONS:
◦ Use the calibration curve to determine the concentration of
Fluvoxamine in patient samples.
◦ If analysis software is available, enter the calibration data to
generate results automatically.
10. REPORTING RESULTS:
◦ Validate all results by review of the calibration curve and
quality control samples.
◦ Document any deviations or issues encountered during the
analysis.
◦ Report results in ng/mL and include comments on any
sample integrity issues or anomalies.
11. QUALITY CONTROL:
◦ Include at least one QC sample with each batch of samples
analyzed.
◦ Review QC results to ensure they fall within the acceptable
range (±2SD of the established mean).
◦ Reassay samples if QC results are not within the acceptable
limits.
12. REFERENCE INTERVALS:
◦ Therapeutic range: 50-300 ng/mL.
◦ Toxic range: >500 ng/mL.
◦ Refer to established clinical guidelines for interpretation.
13. LIMITATIONS:
◦ Hemolysis, lipemia, or icterus may affect assay
performance. Verify results with alternative methods if
necessary.
◦ High concentrations of other psychotropic medications may
interfere with the assay.
14. SAFETY AND DISPOSAL:
◦ Handle all reagents and patient samples with appropriate
personal protective equipment (PPE).
◦ Dispose of waste materials according to hazardous waste
protocols.
