Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase of Generating Results for Focal Segmental
Glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) and Nephrotic Syndrome Gene Panel
1. PURPOSE
This protocol provides comprehensive instructions for the analytical
phase of generating genetic test results for Focal Segmental
Glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) and Nephrotic Syndrome gene panels,
ensuring accurate and reliable analysis for clinical diagnosis and
research applications.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of trained laboratory staff to perform genetic
analyses following this protocol, ensuring adherence to procedural
guidelines and accuracy in result reporting. Supervisors are
responsible for overseeing the implementation of the protocol and
addressing any discrepancies or issues that arise during the
analytical phase.
1. DEFINITIONS
Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis (FSGS): A type of kidney
disease characterized by scarring in the glomeruli, which can lead to
nephrotic syndrome.
Nephrotic Syndrome: A kidney disorder causing the body to excrete
too much protein in the urine.
Gene Panel: A set of genes tested simultaneously to identify genetic
mutations related to FSGS and nephrotic syndrome.
1. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation and DNA Extraction
1. Confirm specimen identity and accessioning information.
2. Utilize a commercially available DNA extraction kit (e.g.,
QIAamp DNA Mini Kit) following the manufacturer’s instructions.
3. Quantify the extracted DNA using a spectrophotometer (e.g.,
NanoDrop) and assess purity.
4. Store extracted DNA at -20°C until ready for analysis.
B) Library Preparation
1. Perform library preparation using a validated gene panel kit
(e.g., Ion Torrent Invitrogen AmpliSeq Custom Panel).
2. Follow manufacturer's protocol for target enrichment and library
amplification, ensuring proper reagent handling and barcode
assignment.
3. Quantify libraries using qPCR or appropriate quantification
methodology.
4. Pool libraries at equimolar concentrations as per the protocol.
C) Sequencing
1. Load prepared libraries onto the sequencing platform (e.g., Ion
Torrent S5).
2. Run sequencer according to established protocols, monitoring
for proper instrument function and reagent consumption.
3. Upon completion of sequencing run, download raw sequencing
data for analysis.
D) Bioinformatics Analysis
1. Use validated bioinformatics pipeline (e.g., Torrent Suite
Software) for initial processing of sequencing data:
◦ Base calling and read alignment to the reference genome.
◦ Variant calling to identify SNPs, insertions, deletions, and
CNVs.
2. Utilize secondary analysis tools (e.g., Integrative Genomics
Viewer (IGV), SAMtools) for in-depth inspection of identified
variants.
3. Filter and annotate variants using databases such as ClinVar,
dbSNP, and proprietary lab databases to classify variant
pathogenicity.
E) Quality Control
1. Perform initial data quality checks including read depth, base
quality scores, and alignment statistics.
2. Utilize internal quality control metrics (e.g., known positive and
negative controls) to ensure accuracy of variant detection.
3. Re-run analysis or repeat sample preparation if quality control
thresholds are not met.
F) Data Interpretation and Reporting
1. Interpret annotated variants in the context of FSGS and
nephrotic syndrome pathogenesis:
◦ Correlate findings with clinical presentation.
◦ Utilize expertise from clinical geneticists and nephrologists,
as appropriate.
2. Compile a comprehensive report including:
◦ Patient identification details.
◦ List of identified variants with clinical significance.
◦ Interpretative comments including recommendations for
further testing or clinical follow-up.
3. Review the report collaboratively among multidisciplinary team
members for final approval.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
5. Regularly participate in external proficiency testing and inter-
laboratory comparisons to ensure methodological robustness.
6. Maintain documentation of all steps performed, ensuring
traceability and accountability.
7. Archive sequencing data and analysis reports electronically,
adhering to data integrity and confidentiality protocols.
