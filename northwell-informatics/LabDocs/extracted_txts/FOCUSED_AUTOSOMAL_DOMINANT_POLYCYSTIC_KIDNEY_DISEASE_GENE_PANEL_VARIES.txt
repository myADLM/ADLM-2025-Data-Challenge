Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Focused Autosomal Dominant Polycystic
Kidney Disease Gene Panel (ADPKD), Varies
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the detailed procedures for
analyzing and generating results for the Focused Autosomal
Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD) Gene Panel. This
gene panel targets known genetic variations associated with
Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for
following this SOP and ensuring accurate and reliable results. The
laboratory supervisor is responsible for overseeing the entire process
and ensuring compliance with CLIA regulations.
1. SPECIMEN HANDLING AND PREPARATION
2.1 Specimen Requirements:
• Specimen type: Whole blood or saliva
• Volume: Minimum 3 mL of whole blood, or 2 mL of saliva
• Collection: Blood should be collected in an EDTA tube. Saliva
should be collected using an approved saliva collection kit.
• Storage: Specimens must be kept at 2-8°C and processed within
72 hours of collection. If delayed, specimens should be stored at
-20°C.
2.2 Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed samples
• Clotted blood samples
• Insufficient sample volume
• Specimens received without proper labels or requisition forms
1. REAGENTS AND EQUIPMENT
3.1 Reagents:
• DNA extraction kit
• PCR reagents and master mix
• Custom primers and probes for ADPKD genes
• Sequencing reagents
3.2 Equipment:
• Centrifuge
• Thermal cycler (PCR machine)
• Gel electrophoresis apparatus
• DNA sequencer
• Micropipettes and tips
• Vortex mixer
1. PROCEDURE
4.1 DNA Extraction:
1. Label all tubes and reagents.
2. Perform DNA extraction using the designated DNA extraction
kit, following the manufacturer's protocol.
3. Quantify and assess the quality of the extracted DNA using a
spectrophotometer.
4. Store the extracted DNA at -20°C until further processing.
4.2 PCR Amplification:
1. Thaw DNA samples and PCR reagents on ice.
2. Prepare the PCR master mix according to the manufacturer's
instructions, adding primers and probes specific for ADPKD
genes.
3. Aliquot the master mix into PCR tubes.
4. Add the DNA template to each PCR reaction tube.
5. Cap the tubes and place them in the thermal cycler.
6. Run the PCR program as specified (e.g., initial denaturation at
95°C for 2 min, followed by 35 cycles of denaturation at 95°C
for 30 sec, annealing at 60°C for 30 sec, and extension at 72°C
for 1 min, with a final extension at 72°C for 5 min).
4.3 Gel Electrophoresis (if required):
1. Prepare 1-2% agarose gel with appropriate buffer.
2. Load PCR products into wells of the agarose gel.
3. Run the gel at 100V for 30-45 minutes.
4. Visualize bands under UV light to confirm successful
amplification.
4.4 DNA Sequencing:
1. Purify PCR products using a PCR purification kit.
2. Quantify purified PCR products and prepare them for
sequencing.
3. Load samples onto a DNA sequencer and run the sequencing
program.
4. Retrieve sequencing data and analyze it using appropriate
software.
5. ANALYSIS AND INTERPRETATION
5.1 Data Analysis:
1. Analyze sequencing data using bioinformatics software to
identify relevant mutations in ADPKD genes.
2. Cross-check identified mutations with known pathogenic
variants listed in genetic databases (e.g., ClinVar).
5.2 Interpretation:
1. Classify identified variants into categories (e.g., pathogenic,
likely pathogenic, variant of uncertain significance, likely
benign, benign) based on established guidelines.
2. Generate a comprehensive report that includes variant
classification, potential clinical implications, and references to
relevant literature.
3. QUALITY CONTROL
6.1 Internal Quality Control:
1. Run positive and negative control samples with each batch of
tests.
2. Monitor reagent expiry dates and storage conditions.
3. Verify equipment calibration and maintenance logs.
6.2 External Quality Control:
1. Participate in external proficiency testing programs for genetic
testing.
2. Compare results with other laboratories to ensure consistency
and accuracy.
3. REPORTING RESULTS
7.1 Report Generation:
1. Compile results and interpretations into a standardized report
format.
2. Review the report for accuracy and completeness.
3. Authorize the report for release.
7.2 Results Communication:
1. Transmit the final report to the ordering physician or healthcare
provider.
2. Ensure that the report is securely stored in the Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
