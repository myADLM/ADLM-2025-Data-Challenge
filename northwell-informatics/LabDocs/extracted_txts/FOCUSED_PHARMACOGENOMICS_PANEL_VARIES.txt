STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE
Title: Analytical Phase Protocol for Generating Results for Focused
Pharmacogenomics Panel
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedures for the analytical phase of generating
accurate and reliable results for the Focused
Pharmacogenomics Panel to guide patient-specific drug
therapy.
2. SCOPE
This protocol applies to all laboratory personnel involved in the
analytical phase of testing for the Focused Pharmacogenomics
Panel.
3. RESPONSIBILITIES
◦ Technologists: Perform the analytical procedures accurately
and ensure all steps are documented.
◦ Supervisors: Oversee the adherence to SOPs, validate
results, and ensure all corrective actions are documented
and performed when necessary.
◦ Quality Control: Monitor QC procedures and results,
ensuring that all equipment and reagents are calibrated and
validated.
4. MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT
◦ PCR amplification devices
◦ DNA extraction kits
◦ Specific primer/probe sets for the pharmacogenomic targets
◦ Real-time PCR system
◦ Thermal cycler
◦ Microcentrifuge
◦ Vortex mixer
◦ Pipettes and pipette tips
◦ Nuclease-free water
5. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Preparation:
◦ Use previously collected and properly stored specimens.
◦ If specimen is not immediately processed, store DNA
extracts at -20˚C for short term or at -80˚C for long-term
storage.
◦ Thaw DNA extracts on ice before starting the analytical
phase.
B. DNA Extraction:
◦ Perform DNA extraction following the standard protocol of
the chosen DNA extraction kit (refer to the manufacturer’s
manual for specific instructions).
◦ Quantify and ensure the purity of the DNA using
spectrophotometry (e.g., NanoDrop) before proceeding.
C. PCR Preparation:
◦ Prepare master mix containing all necessary reagents (e.g.,
buffer, dNTPs, primers, and probes).
◦ Aliquot the master mix into PCR tubes or 96-well plates
ensuring consistent volumes.
◦ Add template DNA to each reaction well or tube, taking care
to avoid contamination.
◦ Include appropriate positive and negative controls to monitor
for contamination and amplification efficiency.
◦ Seal plates/tubes to prevent evaporation.
D. PCR Amplification:
◦ Place the reaction tubes/plates in the thermal cycler and run
the specific cycling conditions for the amplification of
pharmacogenomic targets.
◦ Record the thermocycler program including denaturation,
annealing, and extension steps.
E. Real-Time PCR Analysis:
◦ Transfer the PCR products (if needed) to a real-time PCR
system.
◦ Analyze the amplification data by setting the baseline and
threshold values as per the assay requirements.
◦ Ensure that control samples meet all acceptance criteria
(e.g., Ct values within expected ranges).
6. RESULT INTERPRETATION:
◦ Ensure the correct interpretation of real-time PCR
amplification plots and results.
◦ Utilize software systems as required (e.g., allelic
discrimination software) to determine genotypes of
pharmacogenomic markers.
◦ Review all controls for validity. Ensure no carry-over
contamination or non-specific amplification is present.
7. REPORTING RESULTS:
◦ Document results accurately and ensure alignment with
laboratory information system (LIS) protocols.
◦ Validate results according to laboratory and clinical
guidelines.
◦ Prepare the final report for clinician interpretation, including
details on detected pharmacogenomic variants and any
recommended therapeutic adjustments.
8. QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE
◦ Run appropriate internal controls and standards with each
batch.
◦ Participate in external quality assurance programs and
proficiency testing.
◦ Document and address any deviations from the protocol
immediately, including any corrective actions taken.
9. TROUBLESHOOTING:
◦ In case of failed amplifications, verify the integrity of the
reagents and the performance of the equipment.
◦ If contamination is suspected, perform decontamination
procedures and re-run controls.
