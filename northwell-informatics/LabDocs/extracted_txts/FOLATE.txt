Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Folate
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the accurate and timely
analysis of folate levels in patient specimens using laboratory
instruments and equipment. This SOP ensures consistency in
specimen handling, testing, and reporting, thereby guaranteeing
reliable results.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory staff will perform folate assays as defined
in this procedure.
• It is the responsibility of all staff to identify any deficiencies in the
process which may affect the test results and bring them to the
attention of a supervisor.
• Staff and supervisors must ensure testing is performed and
documented according to the procedures, including any corrective
actions that may be required.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Acceptable Specimens:
• Serum collected in a red stopper or SST (serum separator tube).
• Plasma collected in heparinized tubes (light green or dark green).
• Preserved and centrifuged within 2 hours of collection.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed specimens.
• Specimens collected in EDTA, citrate, or oxalate tubes.
• Specimens that have been improperly labeled, including missing
collection date/time.
3. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Folate assay kit (manufacturer: XXX, Cat. # XXXX)
• Automated analyzer (brand/model: XXX, Serial No: XXXX)
• Calibration standards
• Quality control materials
• Pipettes and tips
• Centrifuge
• Refrigerated storage unit
4. PROCEDURE
Sample Preparation:
• Verify specimen integrity and proper labeling.
• Centrifuge serum or plasma specimens at 1500 x g for 10 minutes
to separate.
• Transfer supernatant to a clean tube, ensuring no hemolysis
occurs.
• Store specimens at 2-8°C if not processed immediately, for up to
48 hours.
Instrument Calibration:
• Calibrate the analyzer according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
• Use calibration standards provided in the folate assay kit.
• Document calibration results in the Calibration Log.
Quality Control:
• Run internal quality control materials before patient testing.
• Use two levels of control (low and high) as specified by the kit
manufacturer.
• Record QC results in the Quality Control Log. Ensure they fall
within the acceptable limits provided by the manufacturer.
• If QC fails, repeat the QC test. If failure persists, troubleshoot the
instrument and reagents before proceeding with patient testing.
Sample Analysis:
• Input patient information into the analyzer. Ensure traceability by
recording specimen ID, collection date, and time.
• Load the specimens into the analyzer as instructed in the folate
assay kit manual.
• Initiate the analysis process as per the manufacturer's
specifications.
• Upon completion, review the results for any flagged discrepancies
or errors.
Troubleshooting:
• If the analyzer flags any discrepancies or errors during the
analysis, refer to the instrument manual for troubleshooting steps.
• If necessary, repeat the analysis. For persistent issues, notify a
supervisor.
5. REPORTING RESULTS
• Verify that all results meet the quality control criteria before
reporting.
• Ensure all findings are accurately entered into the Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
• Review and verify results according to the laboratory’s reporting
guidelines.
• Document any critical values and follow-up actions in the LIS.
• Notify the appropriate healthcare provider of any critical values
immediately, following the Repeat Critical Values guidelines.
6. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Folate: 3.0 - 20.0 ng/mL
7. QUALITY ASSURANCE
• Conduct monthly comparison of folate results between different
analyzers, using patient specimens, to ensure consistency.
• Validate new lots of assay kits with three patient comparisons
before use.
• Document all validation activities and results.

9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the product insert for detailed method limitations, including
interference factors affecting the folate assay results.
10. RECORDS
• Maintain Calibration Logs, Quality Control Logs, and Patient Test
Logs for at least 3 years.
• Ensure all records are readily accessible for inspection and audit.
11. SAFETY AND COMPLIANCE
Ensure compliance with the laboratory's safety guidelines, including
proper disposal of biohazard materials and adherence to personal
protective equipment (PPE) requirements.
This SOP is effective from [Date] and is reviewed annually for
updates and compliance.
