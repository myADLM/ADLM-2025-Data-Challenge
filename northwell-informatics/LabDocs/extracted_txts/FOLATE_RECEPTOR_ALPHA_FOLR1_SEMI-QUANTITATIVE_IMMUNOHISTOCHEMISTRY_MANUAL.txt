1. PURPOSE
To provide a comprehensive and standardized procedure for
performing semi-quantitative immunohistochemistry (IHC) for the
detection of folate receptor alpha (FOLR1) in tissue sections using a
manual technique. This protocol outlines the steps necessary to
obtain reliable and reproducible results.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory personnel, including
technologists and pathologists, are responsible for adhering to this
protocol. Technologists perform the IHC, and pathologists interpret
the stained slides.
1. SPECIMEN
2.1 Acceptable Specimens: - Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded
(FFPE) tissue blocks.
2.2 Unacceptable Specimens: - Poorly fixed or improperly processed
tissue. - Tissue blocks showing significant necrosis or artifacts.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
3.1 Equipment: - Microtome - Staining racks - Humidified chamber -
Light microscope - Timer
3.2 Reagents: - Primary antibody specific for FOLATE RECEPTOR
ALPHA (Source: Vendor, Catalog #, Dilution) - Secondary antibody
(HRP-conjugated) - DAB (3,3'-diaminobenzidine) substrate -
Hematoxylin counterstain - Blocking reagent (e.g., normal serum) -
Antigen retrieval solution (e.g., citrate buffer, pH 6.0) - Washing
buffers (e.g., PBS, TBS)
3.3 Supplies: - Positively charged microscope slides - Cover slips
and mounting medium - Pipettes and tips - Disposable gloves and lab
coat - Forceps and slide racks
1. PROCEDURE
4.1 Preparation: - Cut 4-µm thick sections from FFPE tissue blocks
and mount on positively charged microscope slides. - Bake slides at
60°C for 30 minutes to ensure tissue adherence.
4.2 Deparaffinization and Rehydration: - Deparaffinize slides by
immersing in xylene (3 changes, 5 minutes each). - Rehydrate tissue
sections through graded alcohols (100%, 95%, 70%) for 5 minutes
each. - Wash slides in distilled water for 5 minutes.
4.3 Antigen Retrieval: - Place slides in a preheated antigen retrieval
solution (e.g., citrate buffer, pH 6.0) and heat in a microwave or
pressure cooker according to manufacturer’s instructions. - Allow
slides to cool for 20 minutes at room temperature. - Rinse slides in
distilled water followed by washing in PBS/TBS.
4.4 Blocking: - Incubate slides with a blocking reagent (e.g., 5%
normal serum) for 20 minutes at room temperature to block non-
specific binding. - Remove excess blocking reagent by blotting gently.
4.5 Primary Antibody Incubation: - Incubate slides with a primary
antibody specific for FOLR1, diluted according to manufacturer’s
recommendations, for at least 1 hour at room temperature or
overnight at 4°C in a humidified chamber.
4.6 Washing: - Wash slides in PBS/TBS (3 changes, 5 minutes each)
to remove excess primary antibody.
4.7 Secondary Antibody Incubation: - Incubate slides with an HRP-
conjugated secondary antibody for 30 minutes at room temperature
in a humidified chamber.
4.8 Washing: - Wash slides in PBS/TBS (3 changes, 5 minutes each)
to remove excess secondary antibody.
4.9 Substrate Development: - Incubate slides with DAB substrate
solution until the desired stain intensity is achieved, typically 1-5
minutes. - Monitor staining development under a light microscope. -
Stop the reaction by rinsing in distilled water.
4.10 Counterstaining: - Counterstain with hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes
to visualize cell nuclei. - Rinse slides in distilled water. - Differentiate
in 0.1% acid alcohol if necessary. - Rinse in distilled water followed
by PBS/TBS.
4.11 Dehydration and Mounting: - Dehydrate through graded alcohols
(70%, 95%, 100%) for 2 minutes each. - Clear in xylene (2 changes,
5 minutes each). - Mount coverslips using an appropriate mounting
medium.
1. INTERPRETATION AND REPORTING
5.1 Review and interpret stained slides using a light microscope. 5.2
Pathologists should evaluate each slide for the presence and
intensity of FOLR1 staining. 5.3 Report results as follows: - Intensity:
0 (negative), 1+ (weak), 2+ (moderate), 3+ (strong) - Percentage of
positive cells: Percentage of total cells exhibiting staining.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
6.1 Include appropriate positive and negative control slides in each
staining run. 6.2 Document all results and quality control measures
taken. 6.3 Review and record batch numbers and expiration dates of
all reagents used.
