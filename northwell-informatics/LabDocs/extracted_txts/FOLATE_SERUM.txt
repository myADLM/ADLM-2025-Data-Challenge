Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Folate, Serum Results
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedures for the analytical phase of testing
Folate in serum specimens to ensure accurate and reliable
results.
Responsibility:
Laboratory technologists are responsible for carrying out the
procedures as outlined and ensuring results are accurate, properly
documented, and any issues are promptly addressed.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Immunoassay analyzer (e.g., Roche Cobas e411, Siemens
Immulite 2000, etc.)
• Calibrators and controls specific for serum folate
• Sample tubes: Serum separator tubes (SST) or plain red-top
tubes
• Disposable gloves and lab coat
• Micropipettes and tips
• Timer
1. DEFINITIONS
Folate (Vitamin B9): A water-soluble vitamin crucial for DNA
synthesis and repair, red blood cell formation, and numerous
other bodily functions.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred specimen: Serum collected in serum separator tubes
(SST)
• Acceptable specimen: Serum collected in plain red-top tubes
• Volume requirements: A minimum of 0.5 mL of serum is needed
for the assay
• Stability: Separated serum is stable for 8 hours at room
temperature (18-26°C), 7 days refrigerated (2-8°C), and 1 month
frozen (-20°C).
1. PROCEDURE
5.1 Preparation
2. Wear appropriate PPE (gloves, lab coat) before handling
specimens.
3. Ensure all reagents, controls, and calibrators are at room
temperature before use.
4. Verify that the analyzer has been calibrated using the specific
folate assay calibrators.
5. Ensure quality controls (QC) for low and high folate
concentrations are prepared and run according to
manufacturer’s instructions.
5.2 Sample Preparation
1. Centrifuge blood specimens at 3000 RPM for 10 minutes to
separate serum.
2. Ensure serum is clear and free from hemolysis or lipemia.
3. Transfer the required volume of serum to labeled sample cups
or directly aspirate from the SST.
5.3 Loading and Running the Test
1. Load the prepared samples, calibrators, and controls onto the
analyzer as per manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Program the analyzer with the appropriate folate assay method
according to manufacturer’s guidelines.
3. Confirm that QC results are within acceptable ranges before
proceeding with patient samples.
5.4 Analyzing Results
1. The analyzer will perform the folate assay and provide results.
2. Review the results for each sample; cross-reference with
controls and calibrators to ensure validity.
3. Document any findings or discrepancies.
4. If QC results are out of range, troubleshoot as per
manufacturer’s protocols before re-running samples.
5.5 Post-Analysis
1. Store any remaining serum samples refrigerated at 2-8°C for at
least 72 hours in case re-analysis is necessary.
2. Dispose of all biohazard materials in compliance with laboratory
safety protocols.
3. Clean and maintain the analyzer following the daily
maintenance schedule.
4. REPORTING RESULTS
5. Results will be automatically transmitted to the Laboratory
Information System (LIS) for review.
6. Technologists must verify and interpret the results in the context
of the patient’s history and current clinical status.
7. Flag any critical results or values outside reference ranges, and
report immediately to the attending physician or healthcare
provider.
8. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Adults: 3.1 – 20.5 ng/mL
• Pediatric: Consult age-related reference charts
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Use appropriate QC materials each shift/day of testing.
• Maintain a log of all control results and any corrective actions
taken.
• Review QC logs regularly to identify any trends or persistent
issues.
1. LIMITATIONS AND PRECAUTIONS
• Hemolysis, lipemia, and improper sample handling can lead to
inaccurate results.
• Pharmacological levels of biotin can cause interference in
immunoassays.

and handling of the immunoassay analyzer.
