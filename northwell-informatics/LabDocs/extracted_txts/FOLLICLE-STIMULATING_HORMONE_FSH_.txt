STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE
Title: Follicle-Stimulating Hormone (FSH) Test Analysis
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to outline the steps for the analytical
phase of generating results for Follicle-Stimulating Hormone (FSH) in
serum or plasma. This includes the procedure for preparation,
operation, and interpretation of results using the designated
immunoassay analyzer.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of the trained laboratory personnel to perform
and document all aspects of the FSH analysis according to the
established procedure. The supervisor is responsible for ensuring
compliance with these procedures and addressing any issues that
might affect the quality of test results.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred Specimen:
• Serum separator tube (SST) or plasma (heparinized or EDTA).
Specimen Collection:
• Collect blood in SST or heparinized/EDTA tube.
• Allow serum specimen to clot completely at room temperature
before centrifugation.
• Centrifuge to obtain clear serum/plasma and store at 2-8°C if not
analyzed immediately.
Acceptable Specimen:
• Specimen collected in SST or heparinized tubes, properly labeled
with patient identification details.
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Specimen with significant hemolysis, lipemia, or particulate
matter.
• Specimen received in inappropriate collection tube.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
Immunoassay analyzer (e.g., Roche Cobas e411, Siemens Immulite).
FSH reagent kit. Calibrators. Quality control materials. Micro-pipettes
and tips. Sample cups/vials. Timer. Record-keeping log.
1. PROCEDURE
4.1 Preparation
• Check the immunoassay analyzer for any maintenance issues
and ensure it is ready for use.
• Confirm that the FSH reagent kit is within expiry date and has
been stored appropriately.
• Prepare calibrators and control materials according to
manufacturer's instructions.
4.2 Operation
1. Calibrate the immunoassay analyzer using included calibrators
and verify calibration status.
2. Perform quality control analysis using control materials at both
low and high levels. Document results and ensure they fall
within acceptable range.
3. Load patient specimens along with necessary controls into the
immunoassay analyzer.
4. Follow the analyzer’s specific protocol for running the FSH test.
5. Start the test and monitor the analyzer for any alerts or error
messages.
4.3 Interpretation of Results
• Upon completion, review the generated results for each
specimen.
• Check for quality control flags and ensure all controls are within
acceptable limits before releasing results.
• Record results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Verify and validate results based on established reference
intervals: Reference Intervals: Female: - Follicular phase: 3-12 IU/
L - Ovulatory phase: 5-20 IU/L - Luteal phase: 1-5 IU/L -
Postmenopausal: 16-129 IU/L Male: - Adult: 1-8 IU/L
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run control materials at the beginning and end of each batch of
specimens, and additionally if there are any issues with the
analyzer.
• Document all control results, corrective actions, and any
deviations observed.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Review all patient results and ensure they meet quality control
standards.
• Enter results into the LIS and review entries for accuracy.
• Attach relevant comments or flags to any results that require
further interpretation or are outside the reference range.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If any quality control tests fail, investigate the cause, and take
corrective actions as necessary: recalibrate the analyzer, re-run
controls, or contact technical support.
• If specimen results are unexpected or inconsistent, re-analyze the
specimen or recommend a new sample collection.
