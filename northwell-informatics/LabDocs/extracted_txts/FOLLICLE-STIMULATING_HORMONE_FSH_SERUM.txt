Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analyzing Follicle-
Stimulating Hormone (FSH), Serum
1. PURPOSE
To ensure accurate and reliable measurement of Follicle-Stimulating
Hormone (FSH) in serum specimens using an automated
immunoassay analyzer.
1. SPECIMEN
2.1 Specimen Requirements:
• Preferred specimen: Serum
• Collect blood in a plain red-top tube or serum separator tube
(SST).
2.2 Specimen Handling and Storage:
• Allow blood to clot at room temperature for 30 minutes.
• Centrifuge the sample at 1500-2000 x g for 10 minutes to
separate the serum.
• Store serum at 2-8°C if assaying within 48 hours. For longer
storage, keep at -20°C or below.
2.3 Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric specimens should be avoided as
they may interfere with the results.
• Specimens with insufficient volume.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
3.1 Equipment:
• Automated Immunoassay Analyzer (e.g., Roche Cobas e 411,
Abbott Architect i2000SR)
• Centrifuge
• Precision pipettes
• Refrigerator and freezer
3.2 Reagents:
• FSH Reagent Kit specific to the immunoassay analyzer
• Calibrators and quality control (QC) materials provided by the kit
manufacturer
1. PROCEDURE
4.1 Calibration:
• Perform calibration as specified by the manufacturer.
• Use the calibrators provided in the FSH Reagent Kit.
• Document calibration results in the appropriate log.
4.2 Quality Control:
• Run internal QC samples at the beginning of each shift, after
maintenance, and after calibration.
• Ensure Level 1 and Level 2 QC materials are within the specified
range.
• Document QC results and take necessary corrective actions if QC
results fall outside the acceptable range.
4.3 Sample Preparation:
• Thaw frozen specimens at room temperature and mix gently
before analysis.
• Aliquot an appropriate volume of serum for analysis as specified
by the analyzer.
4.4 Analysis:
1. Load the reagent kit, calibrators, QC materials, and patient
samples onto the immunoassay analyzer as per the
manufacturer's instructions.
2. Program the analyzer to measure FSH in the loaded serum
samples.
3. Start the analysis run and monitor the process for any errors or
alerts from the analyzer.
4.5 Troubleshooting:
• If errors or instrument alerts occur, follow the manufacturer's
troubleshooting guidelines available in the operator’s manual.
• Repeat testing for any samples flagged by the analyzer with
quality control issues detected.
1. RESULT INTERPRETATION
• Reference Range for FSH levels (values may vary slightly based
on the assay used):
◦ Male: 1.5 - 12.4 mIU/mL
◦ Female (Follicular phase): 3.5 - 12.5 mIU/mL
◦ Female (Ovulatory peak): 4.7 - 21.5 mIU/mL
◦ Female (Luteal phase): 1.7 - 7.7 mIU/mL
◦ Postmenopausal: 25.8 - 134.8 mIU/mL
• Verify all results before reporting, especially critical or abnormal
results.
• Any results that fall outside the reference range should be
reviewed and, if necessary, discussed with a pathologist before
reporting.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Enter and review the test results in the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
• Ensure adherence to site-specific reporting protocols.
• Critical results must be communicated promptly to the requesting
physician and documented properly according to laboratory policy.
1. MAINTENANCE
• Daily: Perform routine maintenance and cleaning of the
immunoassay analyzer as per the manufacturer's guidelines.
• Weekly or Monthly: Perform deeper maintenance procedures as
recommended by the manufacturer, ensuring thorough cleaning
and functionality checks.
• Document all maintenance activities in the appropriate log sheets.

This SOP for the analysis of FSH in serum is intended to ensure
high-quality, consistent, and accurate results in compliance with
regulatory standards. It is the responsibility of the laboratory
personnel to follow this protocol meticulously and document all steps
appropriately.
