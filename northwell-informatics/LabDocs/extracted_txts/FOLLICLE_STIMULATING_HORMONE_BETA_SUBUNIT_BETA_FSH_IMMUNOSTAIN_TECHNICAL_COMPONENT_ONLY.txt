Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to provide a detailed procedure for the
immunohistochemical staining and analysis of Follicle Stimulating
Hormone (FSH), beta subunit (Beta FSH) in tissue specimens. This
procedure details only the technical component, focusing on the
preparation, staining, and initial analysis of the Beta FSH
immunostain.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the trained histotechnologists to perform and
document all the steps outlined in this procedure accurately.
Supervisors are responsible for ensuring that all staff are compliant
with this SOP, as well as addressing and troubleshooting any issues
that arise during the staining process.
1. DEFINITION
Beta FSH is an essential hormone for reproductive processes,
produced by the anterior pituitary gland. Immunostaining for Beta
FSH is used to detect its presence and distribution in tissue samples,
aiding the diagnosis of certain conditions, including pituitary tumors.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred Specimens:
• Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks.
Acceptable Specimens:
• 4-5 µm thick sections mounted on positively charged slides.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Sections not mounted on positively charged slides.
• Specimens improperly fixed or processed.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Microtome
• Automated immunostainer
• Incubator
• Microscope
Reagents:
• Primary antibody against Beta FSH
• Secondary antibody
• Detection system (e.g., DAB chromogen)
• Blocking solution
• Antigen retrieval solution
• Hematoxylin or counterstain
Supplies:
• Positively charged slides
• Hydrophobic pen
• Coverslips and mounting medium
• Timer
• Staining jars and racks
1. PROCEDURE
A. Slide Preparation
1. Cut 4-5 µm thick sections from FFPE tissue blocks using a
microtome.
2. Float sections on a water bath and mount them onto positively
charged slides.
3. Allow the slides to dry thoroughly in an incubator set at 60°C for
approximately 1 hour.
B. Deparaffinization and Rehydration
1. Deparaffinize slides by immersing them in three changes of
xylene, 5 minutes each.
2. Rehydrate sections through a graded series of ethanols (100%,
95%, 70%) and then into distilled water, 2-3 minutes each.
C. Antigen Retrieval
1. Perform antigen retrieval using the appropriate antigen retrieval
solution (e.g., citrate buffer pH 6.0 or EDTA buffer pH 9.0)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Heat the solution and immerse slides, heating either in a
microwave, pressure cooker, or water bath for appropriate
duration and temperature.
3. Allow slides to cool in the retrieval solution before rinsing in
distilled water.
D. Blocking
1. Encircle the tissue sections with a hydrophobic pen.
2. Apply blocking solution to cover the entire tissue section to
avoid non-specific binding. Incubate as per the manufacturer’s
recommendation (typically 10-20 minutes).
E. Primary Antibody Application
1. Apply the primary antibody against Beta FSH to the tissue
sections, ensuring even coverage.
2. Incubate the slides in a humidified chamber for the
recommended time, usually 30-60 minutes at room temperature
or overnight at 4°C.
F. Secondary Antibody Application
1. Rinse slides in PBS or TBS buffer to remove excess primary
antibody.
2. Apply the appropriate secondary antibody to the sections.
3. Incubate for the recommended time, typically 10-30 minutes at
room temperature.
G. Detection
1. Rinse the slides in PBS or TBS buffer to remove excess
secondary antibody.
2. Apply the detection system (e.g., DAB chromogen) and
incubate until the desired stain intensity is achieved, usually
5-10 minutes.
3. Rinse slides thoroughly in distilled water.
H. Counterstaining
1. Counterstain with hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes or as required.
2. Rinse in distilled water and blue the slides in a weak solution of
ammonia water or running tap water.
I. Dehydration, Clearing, and Mounting
1. Dehydrate slides rapidly through graded ethanols (70%, 95%,
and 100%) and then through xylene.
2. Apply coverslip using a compatible mounting medium.
3. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include positive control slides known to express Beta FSH with
each batch of staining.
• Include negative control slides where the primary antibody has
been omitted to check for non-specific staining.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• The stained slides are reviewed under a microscope to assess
the presence and intensity of staining.
• Document findings based on the intensity of staining and
percentage of positively stained cells.
• Report any discrepancies, unusual staining patterns, or quality
control issues to the supervisor.
1. LIMITATIONS
• Consult with pathologist for interpretation, as the technical
component does not include diagnostic evaluation.
• Proper fixation and preservation of tissue are crucial for accurate
results. Improperly fixed tissues can yield suboptimal or
misleading results.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions for antibody and detection system.
• Relevant histology textbooks and peer-reviewed publications on
immunohistochemistry.
By following this SOP, the laboratory ensures consistent and accurate
staining of Beta FSH, contributing to the reliable diagnostic process.
