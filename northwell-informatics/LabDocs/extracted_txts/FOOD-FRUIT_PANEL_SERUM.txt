Standard Operating Procedure for Analysis of Food-Fruit Panel,
Serum
1. PURPOSE: This SOP outlines the procedure for the analysis of
serum samples for the Food-Fruit Panel using the designated
immunoassay analyzer. This testing method identifies the
presence of specific IgE antibodies in the serum against a
panel of commonly allergenic fruits to determine potential
allergic reactions.
2. RESPONSIBILITY: It is the responsibility of all certified
laboratory staff to perform and document the Food-Fruit Panel
testing as described in this protocol. Laboratory supervisors are
responsible for ensuring that staff are trained and competent in
performing this SOP and that all equipment and reagents are
properly maintained and calibrated.
3. SAFETY PRECAUTIONS:
◦ Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE)
including gloves, lab coat, and safety glasses.
◦ Handle serum samples and reagents using standard
biosafety practices.
◦ Follow proper waste disposal procedures for biohazardous
materials.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS:
◦ Specimen Type: Serum
◦ Volume Required: Minimum 1 mL
◦ Collection and Handling: Blood should be collected in red-
top tubes or serum separator tubes (SST). Allow the blood
to clot at room temperature for 30 minutes, then centrifuge
for 10 minutes at 1000-2000 x g. Carefully collect the serum,
avoiding hemolysis.
◦ Storage and Stability: Serum samples should be stored at
2-8°C and tested within 7 days. For long-term storage,
specimens should be frozen at -20°C or colder.
5. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES:
◦ Immunoassay analyzer (e.g., Phadia ImmunoCAP, Allergen
Specific IgE Assay System)
◦ Calibrators and controls
◦ Food-Fruit Panel reagents and allergen-coated wells
◦ Pipettes and tips
◦ Centrifuge
◦ Timer
◦ Refrigerated storage
◦ Quality control materials
6. PROCEDURE:
A) Calibration and Quality Control:
◦ Ensure the immunoassay analyzer is calibrated using the
provided calibrators. Perform calibration checks according
to the manufacturer's instructions.
◦ Run quality control samples (low, medium, and high) before
processing patient samples. Document results in the QC
log. Acceptable ranges are provided by the QC material
manufacturer and should be strictly adhered to.
B) Preparation of Reagents:
◦ Reconstitute and prepare reagents as directed in the
manufacturer's insert.
◦ Bring all reagents and samples to room temperature before
use.
C) Sample Loading:
◦ Label the allergen-coated wells with the sample
identification numbers.
◦ Using a calibrated micropipette, add the specified volume
(e.g., 50 µL) of serum sample to each well.
◦ Follow the manufacturer’s instructions regarding the addition
of diluted sera, enzyme conjugates, and substrate solutions.
D) Incubation:
◦ Incubate the wells at the specified temperature and time
according to the manufacturer’s protocol (e.g., 37°C for 60
minutes).
E) Washing:
◦ Wash the wells thoroughly to remove unbound components.
The washing step typically involves filling each well with a
wash buffer, followed by aspiration. Repeat the wash cycle
as described in the kit insert.
F) Detection:
◦ After washing, add the enzyme conjugate to each well and
incubate as instructed.
◦ Add the substrate solution and allow color development for
the specified period at room temperature in the dark.
G) Reading and Interpretation of Results:
◦ Stop the reaction by adding the stop solution.
◦ Measure absorbance at the specified wavelength (e.g., 450
nm) using a microplate reader.
◦ Calculate and interpret the results based on the standard
curve generated from the calibrators.
7. REPORTING RESULTS:
◦ Results are expressed as kU/L and should be reviewed for
validity before reporting.
◦ Critical results or those indicating a significant allergic
reaction should be notified to the requesting physician
immediately.
◦ Enter the results into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS) and verify the data entry.
8. QUALITY ASSURANCE:
◦ Maintain documentation of all quality control, calibration,
and maintenance activities.
◦ Participate in proficiency testing programs to ensure
continuing accuracy and precision of the test.
