Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for FOOD-GRAIN PANEL, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this document is to outline the procedures for the
analytical phase of generating results for the Food-Grain Panel,
Serum. This SOP ensures accurate, consistent, and valid test results
through proper handling, processing, and analysis of serum
specimens using validated protocols and instrumentation.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory scientists are responsible for performing
the analysis as defined in this procedure.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring that the analysis is
performed and documented according to this SOP, including any
corrective actions that may be required.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen type: Serum
• Collection container: Serum separator tube (SST)
• Volume required: Minimum 2 mL of serum
• Stability:
◦ Room Temperature (15-25°C): Up to 8 hours
◦ Refrigerated (2-8°C): Up to 72 hours
◦ Frozen (≤ -20°C): Up to 6 months
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Analytical instruments: High-performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC) or Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)
• Reagents: Specific to the Food-Grain Panel assay kit
• Personal protective equipment (PPE): Gloves, lab coat, safety
goggles
• Calibrators and controls: Specific to the Food-Grain Panel assay
kit
• Pipettes and tips
1. PROCEDURE
4.1 Pre-analytical Steps
• Ensure that all specimens are properly labeled and accompanied
by appropriate documentation.
• Inspect serum specimens for hemolysis, lipemia, or any other
interferences.
• If the specimen integrity is compromised, document and reject
according to laboratory policy.
4.2 Preparation for Analysis
• Allow refrigerated or frozen samples to equilibrate to room
temperature before the analysis.
• Mix samples gently by inversion to ensure homogeneity.
4.3 Calibration and Quality Control
• Perform calibration of the analytical instrument using calibrators
provided in the assay kit as per the manufacturer’s instructions.
• Run quality control (QC) samples at the beginning of each
analytical run. Compare the control results against predetermined
QC ranges.
• Document and take corrective action if QC results fall outside the
acceptable range before proceeding with sample analysis.
4.4 Sample Analysis
• Set up the analytical instrument according to the manufacturer’s
instructions for the Food-Grain Panel assay.
• Pipette the required amount of serum into the designated wells or
tubes.
◦ For ELISA: Follow the specific steps for incubation, washing,
and addition of substrates/stop solutions as outlined in the
assay kit protocol.
◦ For HPLC: Prepare samples according to the method protocol,
inject into the HPLC system, and run the analytical method.
• Document all steps in a laboratory logbook or electronic system,
including sample identification, reagent lot numbers, and
instrument settings used.
4.5 Post-Analytical Steps
• Review the results generated by the analytical instrument.
• Verify that the results of the positive and negative controls are
within acceptable ranges.
• If any discrepancies or outliers are observed, investigate and
reanalyze if necessary.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Transfer results from the instrument to the Laboratory Information
System (LIS) for further processing.
• Review and verify results before reporting:
◦ Check against reference intervals for each analyte in the
Food-Grain Panel.
◦ Document any result outside the reference range and take
appropriate follow-up actions as per laboratory protocol.
• Approve and sign off results before releasing them to the patient's
medical records.
1. QUALITY CONTROL AND MAINTENANCE
• Perform regular maintenance and calibration of analytical
instruments according to manufacturer’s guidelines.
• Keep logs of all calibrations, QC results, and maintenance
activities.
• Participate in external proficiency testing to validate assay
performance periodically.

Panel test
1. REVISION HISTORY
• Document and approve any updates or changes to this SOP as
necessary, with the revision date and details of changes noted.
This document aims to ensure that all procedures related to the
analytical phase of generating Food-Grain Panel, Serum results are
performed in a standardized and compliant manner, adhering to best
practices and regulatory requirements.
