Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) FOOD-NUT Panel #1,
Serum - Analytical Phase
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the steps and guidelines for the
analysis of the FOOD-NUT Panel #1, Serum to ensure accurate and
reliable results.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory personnel
(analytical chemists or technologists) to follow the procedures
specified in this document. The staff must ensure the integrity and
accuracy of the test results and comply with quality control standards.
2. SCOPE
This SOP is applicable to the analysis of serum samples for the
FOOD-NUT Panel #1 which includes selected vitamins, minerals, and
other nutrients.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND HANDLING
Specimens should be serum collected and processed as follows:
• Specimen: 5 mL of serum.
• Collection: Blood should be collected in a plain (red-top) tube.
• Processing: Allow the blood to clot and then centrifuge the sample
to separate the serum. Transfer the serum into a clean, labeled
aliquot tube.
• Storage: Store the serum samples at 2-8°C if analysis is to be
performed within 48 hours. For longer storage, freeze samples at
-20°C or lower.
Note: Follow all standard precautions in handling and processing
serum specimens.
4. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
Equipment:
• Centrifuge (precalibrated)
• Refrigerators and freezers for specimen storage (monitored as
per SOP)
• Analytical balance (precalibrated)
• Pipettes and tips (precalibrated)
• Automated analyzer compatible with FOOD-NUT Panel #1
• Protective equipment (gloves, lab coats, face shields)
Reagents:
• Reference standards and calibrators for FOOD-NUT nutrients (as
specified by the manufacturer)
• Quality control (QC) materials: high, medium, and low levels
• Calibration verification materials
• Reconstitution solutions (as specified)
• Specific reagents and buffers for automated analyzer
5. PROCEDURE
A. Calibration and Quality Control
1. Perform initial calibration of the analyzer according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
2. Prepare and analyze calibration standards.
3. Verify calibration by running QC materials:
◦ Run high, medium, and low-level QC materials.
◦ Ensure all QC results are within established acceptable
ranges before proceeding.
4. Document calibration and QC results per laboratory
documentation procedures.
B. Sample Analysis
1. Preparation:
◦ Ensure all instruments and equipment are properly
calibrated and maintained.
◦ Allow frozen serum samples to thaw completely at room
temperature and thoroughly mix gently by inversion.
◦ If samples require dilution, follow specific dilution guidelines
provided by the test manufacturer.
2. Analysis:
◦ Load samples, controls, and standards onto the automated
analyzer using the sample racks.
◦ Select the FOOD-NUT Panel #1 assay from the analyzer’s
test menu.
◦ Start the run and ensure the analyzer operates without
errors during the analytical process.
◦ Ensure that all samples are identified correctly and their
positions are documented.
3. Result Interpretation:
◦ Upon completion of the analyzer run, retrieve and review the
results.
◦ Ensure that QC results are within acceptable ranges.
◦ If QC results are outside limits, troubleshoot and rectify
before rerunning the affected samples.
◦ All sample results must be manually verified and reviewed
for any potential errors or flags indicated by the analyzer.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results are to be entered into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS) ensuring:
◦ Proper handling of critical values according to laboratory
policy.
◦ Duplicate testing for verification if results are questionable.
◦ Any discrepancies or abnormal values must be discussed with
a supervisor and retested if necessary.
7. QUALITY CONTROL AND MAINTENANCE
• Routine maintenance of analyzers as per manufacturing
instructions must be performed.
• Cleaning schedules for equipment, workspace, and instruments
must be followed.
• Record all maintenance activities in the maintenance log.
8. REFERENCE INTERVALS
The specific reference intervals for each nutrient in FOOD-NUT Panel
#1 will depend on the manufacturer's guidelines and literature
references.
9. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s technical manual for the automated analyzer and
FOOD-NUT Panel #1 kit.
• Relevant clinical literature for interpreting nutrient levels in serum.
• Laboratory quality control and calibration procedures.
