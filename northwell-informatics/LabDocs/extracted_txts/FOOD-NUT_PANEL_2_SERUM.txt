Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Analytical Phase for
Generating Results for FOOD-NUT PANEL #2, SERUM
1. PURPOSE: This SOP outlines the procedures for the analytical
phase of generating results from the FOOD-NUT PANEL #2,
SERUM. This includes the preparation, analysis, and reporting of the
test results to ensure accuracy and reliability according to CLIA
standards.
2. RESPONSIBILITY: Laboratory technologists are responsible for
carrying out all procedures described in this SOP. Supervisors are
tasked with verifying adherence to these procedures and addressing
any issues that arise during the analytical process.
3. SPECIMEN:
• Specimen requirements: Serum samples are obtained from blood
collected in a red-top or serum separator tube (SST).
• Specimen stability: Serum samples should be refrigerated at
2-8°C, analyzed within 24 hours. If analysis is delayed, specimens
may be stored frozen at -20°C or colder for up to one month.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND MATERIALS:
• Food-Nut Panel #2 assay kits
• Calibrated centrifuge
• Refrigerated storage (2-8°C)
• Freezer (-20°C or colder)
• Serological pipettes or automated pipetting systems
• Analytical balance
• Clean glassware and plastic ware
• Laboratory Information System (LIS) for result entry and
verification
5. PROCEDURE:
A) Sample Preparation:
1. Thawing Stored Samples:
◦ Remove frozen serum samples from the freezer and thaw at
room temperature. Ensure samples are mixed thoroughly
before analysis.
◦ Avoid multiple cycles of freezing and thawing to prevent
degradation of the analytes.
2. Centrifugation:
◦ Centrifuge the collected serum samples at 3000 rpm for 10
minutes to separate the serum from any remaining cells or
debris.
◦ Transfer the supernatant (serum) into a new, labelled tube
for further analysis.
B) Calibration and Quality Control:
1. Calibration:
◦ Follow the manufacturer’s instructions to calibrate the
analytical instrument using the provided calibration
standards.
◦ Perform calibration before the start of each analytical batch
and after any maintenance or instrument adjustment.
2. Quality Control:
◦ Include external and internal quality control materials with
known concentrations of analytes within each analytical
batch.
◦ Document and verify QC results. If QC results fall outside of
acceptable ranges, investigate and resolve issues before
proceeding with patient sample analysis.
C) Analytical Procedure:
1. Reagent Preparation:
◦ Prepare reagents as per the manufacturer's guidelines.
Ensure all reagents are within expiration dates and stored at
appropriate temperatures.
2. Sample Analysis:
◦ Set up the Food-Nut Panel #2 assay according to the kit
instructions. This includes loading reagents, calibrators,
controls, and patient samples onto the analytical instrument.
◦ Follow the instrument’s workflow for the assay, ensuring all
steps are completed accurately, including incubation times
and reading absorbances or other measurements as
specified.
3. Data Entry and Verification:
◦ Enter results manually or electronically into the LIS system.
Perform initial data verification by comparing the results
from the instrument printouts with the electronic entries.
◦ Review all QC checks and ensure they meet specified
criteria before proceeding to interpret patient results.
6. REPORTING RESULTS:
1. Interpretation of Results:
◦ Compare patient results against established reference
ranges provided in the assay kit instructions.
◦ Document any deviations or abnormalities and ensure
additional verification if results fall outside of normal ranges.
2. Result Documentation:
◦ Record all patient results in the LIS, ensuring each result is
verified and initialed by the performing technologist.
◦ Include any method limitations and pertinent comments
regarding sample integrity or analysis anomalies in the
patient report.
3. Review and Validation:
◦ Supervisors or designated senior technologists review
results for accuracy and completeness.
◦ Sign off on the final validated report and release results
according to laboratory policy.
7. QUALITY ASSURANCE AND TROUBLESHOOTING:
1. Quality Assurance:
◦ Participate in proficiency testing and periodic peer review to
ensure ongoing accuracy and compliance with CLIA
standards.
◦ Maintain records of calibrations, QC results, and any
corrective actions taken.
2. Troubleshooting:
◦ In case of assay failure or unexpected results, review all
steps from specimen preparation to result analysis.
◦ Address potential equipment malfunctions, reagent issues,
or sample integrity concerns.
◦ Consult with a supervisor to determine corrective action or
reprocessing of samples as necessary.
8. REFERENCES:
• Manufacturer’s instructions for Food-Nut Panel #2 kit.
• Laboratory quality management and standard operation protocols.
• CLIA regulations and guidelines.
9. RECORD RETENTION:
• Maintain all logs, calibration records, QC records, and patient
results according to laboratory policy for record retention, typically
for a minimum of 2 years as per CLIA regulations.
10. REVIEW SCHEDULE:
• This SOP should be reviewed annually and updated as necessary
in accordance with regulatory requirements, technological
advancements, and procedural changes.
