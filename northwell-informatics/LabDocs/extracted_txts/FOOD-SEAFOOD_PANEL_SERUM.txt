Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Food-Seafood Panel, Serum
1. PURPOSE
This protocol outlines the procedure for the analytical phase of
generating results for the Food-Seafood Panel in serum specimens.
The objective is to ensure accurate, reliable, and timely results while
maintaining quality control and compliance with regulatory standards.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of designated laboratory staff to follow this procedure when performing the Food-Seafood Panel tests.
1. DEFINITION
The Food-Seafood Panel, Serum is a diagnostic test performed to
identify allergenic responses to various seafood components in a
patient's serum. This includes testing for IgE antibodies specific to
seafood proteins.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND HANDLING
a. Preferred Specimen: Serum collected via venipuncture in a
serum separator tube (SST). b. Sample Volume: Minimum of 2
mL serum. c. Storage and Stability: Specimens should be
stored at 2-8°C and are stable for up to 72 hours. For long-term
storage, serum specimens should be frozen at -20°C or colder.
d. Unacceptable Specimens: - Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric
specimens. - Specimens not collected in SST. - Specimens
received in the laboratory beyond the stability time frame.
2. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
a. Instrumentation: Immunoassay analyzer (e.g., Phadia
ImmunoCAP 250, Siemens Immulite 2000) b. Reagents:
Specific IgE assay kits for seafood allergens (e.g., shrimp, crab,
lobster, fish) c. Controls: Positive and negative IgE controls d.
Supplies: Pipettes, microcentrifuge tubes, disposable tips,
gloves, and lab coats
3. PROCEDURE
a. Preparation and Setup: i. Ensure all reagents and controls
are within expiration date and have reached room temperature
before use. ii. Perform instrument calibration according to
manufacturer’s instructions. iii. Prepare samples and controls
according to the immunoassay kit instructions.
b. Sample Processing: i. Centrifuge serum specimens at
1,500-2,000 x g for 10 minutes to ensure clear separation of
serum. ii. Label microcentrifuge tubes with patient identifiers
and aliquot serum samples. iii. Load serum samples, controls,
and reagents into the immunoassay analyzer following the
instrument’s user manual.
c. Immunoassay Execution: i. Select the Food-Seafood Panel
assay on the instrument. ii. Run the assay according to the
manufacturer’s specifications. iii. Monitor the assay run; ensure
all steps are performed correctly and instrument alerts are
addressed promptly.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
a. Run positive and negative controls with each batch of patient
samples. b. Verify control results are within the acceptable
range before releasing patient results. c. Document control
results and take corrective actions if controls are out of range.
5. RESULTS REPORTING
a. Review and verify assay results for each patient sample. b.
Ensure all quality control criteria are met prior to result release.
c. Transmit results to the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
for review. d. Report results to the clinician using the LIS,
ensuring to include reference intervals.
6. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
a. Results are interpreted based on the presence and levels of
specific IgE antibodies to seafood components. b. Reference
Intervals: - Negative: < 0.35 kUA/L - Borderline: 0.35 – 0.69
kUA/L - Positive: ≥ 0.70 kUA/L
7. TROUBLESHOOTING
a. If the instrument exhibits errors or unusual results, refer to
the manufacturer’s troubleshooting guide. b. For failed quality
controls, do not release patient results. Investigate and resolve
the issue, re-run controls and patient samples.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
a. False positives or negatives may occur due to cross-
reactivity or antibody interference. b. Results should be
interpreted in conjunction with clinical findings and other
diagnostic tests.
