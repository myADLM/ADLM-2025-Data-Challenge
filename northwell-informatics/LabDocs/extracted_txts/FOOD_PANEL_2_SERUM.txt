Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for
the Analytical Phase of Generating Results
for FOOD PANEL #2, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
This SOP delineates the procedures and responsibilities for the
analytical phase of testing and generating results for FOOD PANEL
#2, SERUM. These tests are performed to identify and quantify
specific food-related antibodies present in patient serum samples.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
Laboratory technologists are responsible for conducting the tests and
ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the results according to this
SOP. Supervisors are responsible for overseeing the adherence to
the procedures and for addressing any issues that arise during
testing.
3. DEFINITIONS
Food Panel #2, Serum: A diagnostic test that screens for specific
food-related antibodies in a serum sample.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Serum Sample:
• Preferred: Freshly drawn serum from a venous blood sample.
• Volume: Minimum of 1 mL of serum.
• Storage: If testing is not immediate, store the serum at 2-8°C for
up to 72 hours. For longer storage, freeze at ≤ -20°C. Avoid
repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Centrifuge
• Incubators
• Microplate Reader
• Pipettes and tips
• Refrigerators & Freezers
Reagents:
• Food Panel #2 antibody testing kit
• Controls: Positive and Negative controls
• Calibrators
• Wash buffer, substrate solution, stop solution
6. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation
1. Centrifuge the blood sample: Spin the collected blood sample
at 1500 x g for 10 minutes to separate serum from cells.
2. Collection of serum: Transfer the supernatant serum into a
labelled cryovial using a disposable pipette.
B. Calibration and Controls
1. Run calibration and quality control:
◦ Prepare and run the calibrators and control samples
(positive and negative) as per the kit’s instructions.
◦ Verify that control results fall within the expected ranges. If
outliers are detected, troubleshoot and rerun controls before
proceeding with patient samples.
C. Assay Procedure
1. Plate Setup:
◦ Dispense 100 µL of patient serum, calibrators, and controls
into the appropriate wells of a microplate.
2. Incubation:
◦ Add reagent solution to each well if required by the assay.
◦ Incubate as specified in the kit instructions (e.g., at 37°C for
30 minutes).
3. Washing:
◦ After incubation, wash the wells with wash buffer as
instructed (usually 3-5 times).
4. Substrate Addition:
◦ Add the substrate solution to each well and incubate in the
dark for the specified time.
5. Stopping Reaction:
◦ Add stop solution to each well to terminate the reaction.
D. Reading and Calculation
1. Measurement:
◦ Read the absorbance at the appropriate wavelength using a
microplate reader (typically at 450 nm with a reference
wavelength of 620 nm).
2. Data Interpretation:
◦ Construct a standard curve using the calibrators.
◦ Calculate the concentration of antibodies in the patient
samples based on the standard curve.
7. RESULT REPORTING
1. Verify the results accuracy against quality control data.
2. Enter patient results into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
3. Flag any critical results and notify the appropriate clinical
personnel as per the lab’s protocol.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Run controls: Positive and Negative controls must be included
in each run.
2. Verify that the calibration curve and controls fall within the
acceptable range.
3. Document all quality control results and actions taken if control
results fall outside the expected range.
9. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Refer to the specific test kit insert or lab’s established ranges for
reference intervals for the food panel antibodies.
10. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the individual reagent and test kit instructions for limitations
and potential interfering substances.
