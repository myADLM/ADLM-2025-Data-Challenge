Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Food Panel IgG4 (532)
1. PURPOSE
To ensure accurate and reliable generation of results for Food Panel
IgG4 (532) testing by following standardized laboratory procedures.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all designated laboratory personnel to
perform the procedures outlined in this SOP and to ensure accurate
and timely generation and reporting of results. Supervisors are
responsible for ensuring adherence to these procedures and
addressing any issues that arise.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• ELISA Plate Reader and Washer
• Microtiter plates coated with specific food antigens
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Calibrated micropipettes
• Vortex mixer
• Incubator (37°C)
• Wash buffer
• Sample diluent
• Substrate solution (TMB)
• Stop solution (1 N H2SO4)
• Control samples (positive and negative controls)
• Patient serum samples
• Plate sealers
• Assay protocol cards or software
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Serum: Collect blood in a serum separator tube (SST). Allow
blood to clot for 30 minutes and centrifuge for 10 minutes at
2000-2500 RPM.
Acceptable:
◦ Serum that is free from hemolysis and lipemia.
Unacceptable:
◦ Grossly hemolyzed or lipemic samples.
◦ Samples that have been stored at room temperature for over
24 hours.
5. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation
1. Reagent Preparation:
◦ Bring all reagents to room temperature before use.
◦ Prepare wash buffer by diluting the stock solution with
deionized water as indicated by the manufacturer.
2. Plate Setup:
◦ Label the microtiter plate with appropriate sample, control,
and standard identifications.
B. Assay Procedure
1. Sample and Control Addition:
◦ Pipette 100 µL of controls (positive control, negative control)
and diluted patient serum samples into designated wells.
2. Incubation:
◦ Cover the plate with a plate sealer.
◦ Incubate the plate at 37°C for 60 minutes.
3. Washing:
◦ Aspirate the contents of each well.
◦ Wash the plate 3 times with wash buffer using the plate
washer. Ensure complete removal of liquid after each wash.
4. Conjugate Addition:
◦ Add 100 µL of enzyme-conjugated secondary antibody to
each well.
◦ Cover the plate and incubate at room temperature for 30
minutes.
5. Second Washing:
◦ Repeat the washing steps as described above.
6. Substrate Addition:
◦ Add 100 µL of substrate solution to each well.
◦ Incubate the plate in the dark at room temperature for 15-30
minutes.
◦ Monitor for color development.
7. Stopping Reaction:
◦ Add 100 µL of stop solution to each well to terminate the
reaction. The solution in the wells should turn yellow.
8. Reading the Results:
◦ Read the absorbance of each well at 450 nm with a
reference filter set at 620 nm using an ELISA plate reader.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run positive and negative controls with each batch of samples to
ensure the assay performs as expected.
• The coefficient of variation (CV) between replicates of controls
should not exceed the acceptable limits defined by the assay
protocol (usually ≤15%).
7. RESULT INTERPRETATION
• Calculate the average absorbance values for controls and patient
samples.
• Construct a standard curve by plotting the absorbance values of
the standards against their known concentrations.
• Determine the concentration of IgG4 specific for each food
antigen in patient samples using the standard curve and the
assay software.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results should be entered into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS) for review and verification by the responsible laboratory
technologist.
• Review and validate the results according to the laboratory's
reporting guidelines, checking for any discrepancies or anomalies.
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Cross-reactivity with other IgG subclasses may occur.
• High levels of rheumatoid factor in patient samples can lead to
false-positive results.
• Heterophile antibodies in patient specimens can cause
interference.
