FOOD PANEL II IgG SOP
1. Purpose
The purpose of this standard operating procedure (SOP) is to
establish a standardized process for the analytical phase of
generating results for Food Panel II IgG using enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technology to ensure accurate,
consistent, and reliable test results.
2. Scope
This SOP applies to all personnel performing the Food Panel II IgG
analysis in the laboratory.
3. Responsibilities
• It is the responsibility of the trained laboratory personnel to
perform the Food Panel II IgG analysis according to this SOP.
• The supervisor or designated personnel will monitor compliance
with this SOP and address any issues that may arise during
testing.
• All staff are responsible for reporting and documenting any
deviations from the procedures outlined in this SOP.
4. Specimen Requirements and Handling
• Preferred specimen: Serum obtained from whole blood collected
in a serum separator tube (SST).
• Minimum volume: 1 mL serum.
• Stability: Serum specimens must be stored at 2-8°C until testing
can be performed, and are stable for up to 7 days. For longer
storage, specimens should be kept at -20°C or colder.
• Unacceptable specimens: Hemolyzed, lipemic, icteric, or
improperly labeled specimens.
5. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies
• ELISA reader equipped with a 450 nm filter.
• ELISA washer.
• Micropipettes and tips.
• Food Panel II IgG ELISA Kit, which includes:
◦ Coated microtiter plates with food antigen wells.
◦ Wash buffer.
◦ Diluent buffer.
◦ Standards and controls.
◦ Enzyme conjugate.
◦ Substrate (TMB).
◦ Stop solution.
• Disposable gloves and lab coat.
• Laboratory timer.
6. Procedure
6.1. Preparation
• Bring all reagents and specimens to room temperature (18-25°C)
prior to the start of the assay.
• Label all necessary tubes and pipets for standards, controls, and
patient samples.
6.2. Assay Procedure
1. Dilution of Patient Serum Samples:
◦ Dilute patient serum samples 1:100 in the diluent buffer
(e.g., 10 µL serum + 990 µL buffer).
2. Plate Preparation:
◦ Add 100 µL of each diluted patient sample, standard, and
control into the appropriate wells of the microtiter plate.
◦ Tap the plate gently to mix.
3. Incubation:
◦ Cover the plate with an adhesive film and incubate at room
temperature for 1 hour.
4. Washing Steps:
◦ Aspirate the contents of the wells and wash the plate 5
times with the provided wash buffer using an ELISA washer
(300 µL/well).
◦ After the final wash, invert the plate and tap it firmly on
absorbent paper to remove any residual wash buffer.
5. Adding Enzyme Conjugate:
◦ Add 100 µL of enzyme conjugate to each well.
◦ Cover the plate and incubate at room temperature for 30
minutes.
6. Washing Steps:
◦ Repeat the washing steps (Step 4).
7. Substrate Reaction:
◦ Add 100 µL of TMB substrate to each well.
◦ Incubate at room temperature in the dark for 15 minutes.
8. Stopping the Reaction:
◦ Add 100 µL of stop solution to each well to terminate the
reaction.
◦ The color should change from blue to yellow.
9. Reading the Absorbance:
◦ Read the absorbance of each well at 450 nm using an
ELISA reader within 30 minutes of stopping the reaction.
7. Quality Control
• Run positive and negative controls with each assay to ensure the
accuracy and validity of the results.
• Monitor and document all control results to ensure they fall within
the established acceptable range.
• If controls do not perform as expected, reassess the entire
process, repeat the assay, and notify the supervisor.
8. Calculating Results
• Calculate the mean absorbance for each set of duplicate
standards, controls, and samples.
• Construct a standard curve by plotting the mean absorbances of
the standards against their corresponding concentrations.
• Determine the IgG concentrations of the patient samples by
interpolation from the standard curve.
9. Reporting Results
• Results should be reported in U/mL according to the site-specific
reporting guidelines.
• Verify the results according to the laboratory protocol before
entering them into the laboratory information system (LIS).
10. Reference Intervals
• Normal range: < 20 U/mL
• Borderline: 20 - 30 U/mL
• Elevated: > 30 U/mL
11. Method Limitations
• Refer to the specific package insert for limitations of the Food
Panel II IgG ELISA kit.
• Ensure that hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric specimens are not
processed as these can interfere with assay results.

13. Document Control
• This SOP is subject to revision. Any updates or changes will be
documented and communicated to all laboratory personnel.
