Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analysis of Food Panel,
Serum
1. Purpose
The purpose of this SOP is to provide a step-by-step protocol for the
analytical phase of generating results for the Food Panel, Serum.
This ensures accuracy, consistency, and reliability in the analysis of
food-specific IgE antibodies in serum samples, aiding in the
diagnosis of food allergies.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of trained laboratory personnel to perform the
food panel analysis according to this procedure. The supervisor must
ensure that all staff adhere to these procedures and address any
errors or deviations promptly.
1. Definitions
Food Panel, Serum: A set of specific IgE antibody tests to various
food allergens to diagnose potential food allergies. Analyzers:
Automated systems used to measure food-specific IgE levels in
serum samples (e.g., ImmunoCAP system).
1. Equipment and Reagents
• ImmunoCAP analyzer (or equivalent)
• ImmunoCAP reagent kits for food allergens
• Calibrators and controls specific to the test kit
• Samples of patient serum
• Pipettes and tips
• Centrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Disposable gloves
• Laboratory coat
• Biohazard waste containers
1. Sample Requirements and Stability
• Specimen: Serum.
• Collection: Serum samples should be collected using standard
phlebotomy techniques.
• Volume: Minimum volume required is 1 mL of serum.
• Storage: Serum samples should be stored at 2-8°C for up to 7
days. For long-term storage, freeze at -20°C or lower for up to 6
months.
• Unacceptable specimens: Hemolyzed, icteric, or lipemic samples
should not be used as they may interfere with the assay.
1. Procedure
Sample Preparation:
• Thaw serum samples if previously frozen.
• Mix thoroughly using a vortex mixer before analysis.
• Centrifuge samples at 3,000 rpm for 10 minutes to remove any
particulate matter.
Calibration and Quality Control:
• Follow manufacturer’s instructions to calibrate the ImmunoCAP
analyzer.
• Run quality control samples at least once per day or per shift, and
additionally whenever a new reagent lot is used.
• Quality control samples should fall within the expected range. If
QC results fall outside acceptable limits, troubleshoot and re-
calibrate as needed.
Assay Procedure:
• Load serum samples, calibrators, and controls onto the
ImmunoCAP analyzer.
• Program the analyzer according to the manufacturer’s instructions
for the food panel test.
• Run the assay as per the manufacturer's protocol which typically
includes incubation, washing, and measurement steps.
• Ensure that all samples and controls are properly labeled and
loaded into the correct positions.
Data Analysis and Reporting:
• Review and validate the results generated by the analyzer.
• Ensure that the results meet the criteria for acceptance as
outlined by the manufacturer.
• Record the IgE levels for each food allergen in the laboratory
information system (LIS).
• Report results to the requesting physician. Critical values should
be communicated immediately as per laboratory policy.
1. Quality Control and Assurance
• Quality control samples must be analyzed with each run.
Acceptable ranges must be established and adhered to.
• Participate in external proficiency testing (EPT) or inter-laboratory
comparison programs to ensure reliability of results.
• Regular maintenance and calibration of the analyzer should be
performed as per the manufacturer’s guidelines.
• Documentation of all assay runs, including any deviations and
corrective actions taken, should be meticulously maintained.
1. Troubleshooting
• If a sample result falls outside the expected range, re-test the
sample.
• Check for signs of sample hemolysis, lipemia, or icterus which
can affect results.
• If QC results are out of range, re-calibrate the analyzer and run
the QC samples again.
• Consult the manufacturer’s technical support if instrument errors
persist.

This SOP provides a structured approach for the analysis of food-
specific IgE antibodies in serum specimens to ensure the generation
of accurate, reliable, and reproducible results.
All laboratory staff must adhere to this SOP and undergo regular
training to ensure compliance with the latest standards and practices.
