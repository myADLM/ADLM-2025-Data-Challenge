Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Formaldehyde, IgE, Serum
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is to
outline the analytical procedures required to generate accurate and
reliable results for formaldehyde and Immunoglobulin E (IgE) in
serum samples.
RESPONSIBILITY:
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for the analytical phase of
testing. All results must be verified by a qualified technologist before
releasing results to the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Type: Serum
• Volume Required: Minimum volume of 2 mL
• Storage: Serum samples should be stored at 2-8°C and are
stable for up to 72 hours. If testing is to be delayed beyond 72
hours, samples should be frozen at -20°C or lower.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Centrifuge
• Micropipettes and tips
• Formaldehyde assay kit
• IgE assay kit
• Reagent-grade water
• Standard laboratory glassware (e.g., test tubes, beakers)
• Appropriate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
• Calibrators and controls for IgE and formaldehyde
1. REAGENT STORAGE AND PREPARATION
• Store all reagents as per the manufacturer's instructions.
• Prepare reagents freshly before use unless otherwise specified by
the manufacturer.
• Ensure that all calibrators and controls are handled according to
the respective kit's instructions.
1. PROCEDURE
A) Formaldehyde Analysis:
1. Preparation:
• Allow all reagents and samples to reach room temperature.
• Thaw frozen serum samples completely and mix gently by
inversion before use.
1. Assay Procedure:
• Pipette an appropriate volume as specified by the assay kit (e.g.,
50 µL) of the serum sample, calibrators, and controls into their
respective wells.
• Add the specified reagents sequentially as per the assay protocol.
• Incubate the assay plate/tubes according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
• Measure the absorbance or fluorescence as indicated in the
assay kit at the appropriate wavelength using a
spectrophotometer or plate reader.
1. Calculating Results:
• Create a standard curve using the absorbance or fluorescence
values of the calibrators.
• Calculate the concentration of formaldehyde in the serum
samples by comparing their readings to the standard curve.
1. Quality Control and Documentation:
• Run quality control samples with each batch of tests to ensure
accuracy.
• Document all quality control results and take corrective actions if
needed.
B) IgE Analysis:
1. Preparation:
• Allow reagents and serum samples to reach room temperature.
• Thoroughly mix all calibrators, controls, and serum samples
before use.
1. Assay Procedure:
• Pipette the required volume as specified by the assay kit (e.g.,
100 µL) of each sample, calibrator, and control into the
designated wells.
• Add the enzyme conjugate and other specified reagents.
• Incubate the assay plate/tubes according to the manufacturer’s
protocol.
• Wash the wells as instructed to remove unbound materials.
• Add the substrate solution, incubate for the stipulated time, and
then add the stop solution.
• Measure absorbance at the specified wavelength using a plate
reader.
1. Calculating Results:
• Generate a standard curve from the absorbance values of the
calibrators.
• Determine the IgE concentration in serum samples by comparing
sample readings to the standard curve.
1. Quality Control and Documentation:
• Include appropriate controls in each assay to validate the results.
• Record all results and review quality control data before releasing
patient results.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• All results should be reviewed and verified by a certified
technologist.
• Enter results into the LIS, ensuring that all data are accurate and
complete.
• Notify the ordering physician of any critical values promptly as per
the laboratory's critical value policy.
1. QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE
• Perform routine maintenance and calibration of all equipment as
per manufacturer’s recommendations.
• Run internal quality controls and participate in external proficiency
testing regularly.
• Document all quality control and assurance activities.
1. LIMITATIONS
• Test results are invalid if the assay control values do not fall within
specified limits.
• Hemolysis, lipemia, or icterus in serum samples may interfere
with test results. Samples should be visually inspected and
flagged if such interferences are noted.
1. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS
• Follow standard biosafety guidelines.
• Wear appropriate PPE including lab coat, gloves, and eye
protection.
• Handle all reagents and specimens according to the Material
Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) guidelines.
