FORMIC ACID, SERUM – Analytical Phase Standard Operating
Procedure (SOP)
1. PURPOSE
To describe the procedures for the analysis of formic acid in serum
samples and to ensure the accuracy and reliability of test results.
Responsibility: Designated staff trained in this procedure are
responsible for performing the analysis and ensuring accurate
documentation of all steps. Supervisors are responsible for
overseeing the process and ensuring adherence to the protocol.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
2.1 Preferred/Acceptable Specimens:
• 5 mL of serum collected in a red-top or SST (Serum Separator
Tube)
• Ensure that the blood sample is collected and processed within 2
hours.
• Serum samples should be free of hemolysis.
2.2 Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens contaminated with hemolysis.
• Samples stored incorrectly (not refrigerated or frozen if longer
storage is needed).
• Specimens without proper labeling or that are collected
improperly.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
3.1 Equipment:
• High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system with UV
detection
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Vortex mixer
• Sample vials
3.2 Reagents:
• Formic acid standard solutions
• Mobile phase solvents (e.g., acetonitrile, water, acid additive for
pH adjustment as needed)
• Internal standard (if applicable)
• Calibration standards and quality control materials
1. PROCEDURE
4.1 Sample Preparation:
• Allow the serum sample to clot, then centrifuge at 1,500 x g for 10
minutes to obtain a clear supernatant.
• Transfer the serum into a clean sample vial.
• If samples are not analyzed immediately, store at 4°C for up to 24
hours or at -20°C for longer storage periods.
4.2 HPLC Sample Analysis:
• Perform calibration of the HPLC system using appropriate
calibration standards.
• Prepare the mobile phase according to the manufacturer’s
guidelines.
• Set up the HPLC system according to the specified parameters
for formic acid detection (e.g., column type, flow rate, detection
wavelength).
• Inject the calibration standards, quality control samples, and
patient samples into the HPLC system.
4.3 Calibration and Quality Control:
• Analyze the calibration standards before the patient samples to
create a calibration curve.
• Include quality control samples to ensure accuracy and precision
of the assay.
• If quality control samples fall outside acceptable limits, investigate
and resolve any issues before proceeding with patient samples.
4.4 Data Analysis:
• Use the calibration curve to determine the concentration of formic
acid in patient serum samples.
• Ensure all patient results are within the linear range of the
calibration curve.
• Document any deviations or anomalies encountered during the
analysis.
4.5 Reporting Results:
• Verify results according to site-specific guidelines.
• Input results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• If results are critical or outside reference ranges, follow the
appropriate protocol for reporting and review.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Run internal quality control samples with each batch of
patient samples according to site-specific guidelines.
◦ Perform routine maintenance and calibration on the HPLC
system to ensure optimal performance.
◦ Document all quality control activities and results in the
quality control log.
2. REFERENCE INTERVALS
◦ Normal ranges for formic acid concentration in serum will be
provided based on laboratory-specific validation studies
and/or literature references.
3. TROUBLESHOOTING
◦ If discrepancies are noted in quality control samples or
patient results, repeat the analysis and check for potential
sources of error (e.g., instrument malfunction, reagent
issues).
◦ Document and address any performance issues
encountered during analysis.
4. DOCUMENTATION AND RECORD KEEPING
◦ Maintain detailed records of all calibration, quality control,
and patient sample analyses.
◦ File documentation logs according to standard laboratory
procedures for traceability and audit purposes.
5. SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS
◦ Handle all reagents and patient samples with appropriate
personal protective equipment (PPE) and follow the
laboratory's biosafety guidelines.
