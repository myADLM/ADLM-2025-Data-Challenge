Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for FOSB, Immunostain, Technical
Component Only
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this Standard Operating Procedure is to outline the
steps and responsibilities in the analytical phase of generating results
for FOSB (Formalin-fixed, parrafin-embedded (FFPE) On Slide
Block), Immunostain, Technical Component Only. This ensures that
all processes are conducted systematically and results are accurate
and reliable.
2. RESPONSIBILITIES
• Pathologists/Technologists: Responsible for performing the
immunostain procedure and ensuring the protocol is strictly
followed.
• Laboratory Supervisors: Ensuring that personnel are
adequately trained and that procedures are followed. Responsible
for troubleshooting and resolving any issues that may arise.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Formalin-fixed, Paraffin-embedded (FFPE)
tissue sections on slides.
• Specimen Handling: Ensure slides are handled carefully to avoid
scratching or damage. Store slides at Room Temperature.
4. PROCEDURE
Preparation for Immunostaining:
1. Reagent Preparation:
◦ Prepare or obtain stock solutions of primary and secondary
antibodies, diluents, buffers, and detection reagents (e.g.,
DAB substrate).
◦ All reagents should be at room temperature before use.
Check expiry dates and ensure proper labeling.
2. Slide Pre-Treatment:
◦ Ensure slide labeling is accurate and matches the request
form.
◦ Perform deparaffinization by incubating slides in a series of
xylene baths followed by rehydration through a graded
ethanol series.
◦ Carry out antigen retrieval using the appropriate method
(e.g., heat-induced epitope retrieval using a microwave or
water bath).
Immunostaining Procedure:
1. Blocking:
◦ Incubate slides with blocking solution (e.g., normal serum or
BSA) to prevent non-specific binding.
2. Primary Antibody Incubation:
◦ Apply the prepared primary antibody to the tissue section on
the slide.
◦ Incubate according to the manufacturer’s recommended
time and temperature, typically 30 minutes to 1 hour at room
temperature.
3. Washing:
◦ Wash slides in appropriate buffer (e.g., Tris-buffered saline)
to remove unbound primary antibody.
4. Secondary Antibody Incubation:
◦ Apply secondary antibody conjugated with enzyme or
fluorophore.
◦ Incubate for the recommended time and temperature.
5. Washing:
◦ Wash slides again to remove unbound secondary antibody.
6. Chromogen/Substrate Application:
◦ Apply appropriate detecting reagent (e.g., DAB substrate for
HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies).
◦ Incubate for a precise time until the desired stain intensity is
reached.
7. Counterstaining (If Required):
◦ Counterstain the tissue sections using hematoxylin.
◦ Rinse with running water to remove excess stain.
8. Dehydration and Mounting:
• Dehydrate the tissue by passing slides through graded ethanol
and xylene series.
• Mount a coverslip using a permanent mounting medium.
Quality Control:
1. QC Slide Review:
◦ Include positive and negative control slides with each batch
of staining.
◦ Verify staining patterns on control slides to ensure the
procedure worked correctly.
Documentation:
1. Recording Results:
◦ Document all steps taken, deviation if any, and
observations.
◦ Record the run on a QC log and keep records of reagent lot
numbers and expiry dates.
2. Verification:
◦ Review the stained slide under a microscope to ensure
appropriate staining and absence of artifacts.
◦ Record observations and any discrepancies noted.
Reporting Results:
1. Result Documentation:
◦ Record the staining results in the Laboratory Information
System (LIS) as per laboratory standards.
◦ Flag any discrepancies or abnormal findings for pathologist
review.
2. Documentation and Storage:
◦ Ensure all documents and records associated with the
tested slides and reagents are updated and stored
according to lab protocols.
◦ Properly store slides for long-term archiving as required by
laboratory regulations.
5. TROUBLESHOOTING
• Inconsistent Staining: Check antibody concentrations,
incubation times, and antigen retrieval conditions.
• High Background: Increase blocking time or change blocking
reagent.
• Weak Staining: Optimize the concentration of primary and
secondary antibodies.
6. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's instructions for antibodies and detection reagents.
• Laboratory SOP for handling and processing FFPE tissues.
• Relevant peer-reviewed journals and immunohistochemistry
manuals.
7. REVIEW AND REVISION
This SOP shall be reviewed annually or as needed based on
procedural updates, new technical guidelines, or changes in
laboratory practices. Revisions must be approved by the laboratory
supervisor.
