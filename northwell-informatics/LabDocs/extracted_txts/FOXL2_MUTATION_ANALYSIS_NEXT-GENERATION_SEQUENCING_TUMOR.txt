Protocol for FOXL2 Mutation Analysis: Next-Generation
Sequencing, Tumor Samples
1. Purpose
To provide a standardized protocol for the detection of mutations in
the FOXL2 gene via next-generation sequencing (NGS) in tumor
samples. This protocol ensures the accurate and reliable
identification of genetic mutations associated with specific tumor
pathologies.
Responsibility: It is the responsibility of the technologists and
laboratory personnel to follow this protocol accurately and perform all
necessary steps, quality control checks, and documentation during
the analytical phase of the process.
1. Specimen Requirements:
◦ Tumor tissue obtained via biopsy or surgical resection.
◦ Specimens must be stored in 10% neutral buffered formalin
and processed into formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded
(FFPE) tissue blocks.
◦ A minimum of 5-10 µm tissue sections should be cut and
mounted onto slides. Approximately 5-10 slides provide
sufficient material for DNA extraction.
2. Reagents and Supplies:
◦ DNA extraction kit (validated for use with FFPE tissue).
◦ Qubit fluorometer or equivalent for DNA quantification.
◦ Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) platform (e.g., Illumina
MiSeq, Ion Torrent).
◦ FOXL2-specific primers and probes.
◦ Library preparation kit.
◦ PCR thermocycler.
◦ Sequencing data analysis software (e.g., Illumina
BaseSpace, Ion Reporter).
3. Equipment:
◦ Microtome.
◦ Thermocycler.
◦ NGS sequencer.
◦ Bioanalyzer or TapeStation for assessing library quality.
◦ Qubit fluorometer or equivalent for DNA quantification.
◦ Computer with necessary software for data analysis.
4. Procedure:
A) DNA Extraction:
1. Prepare Tissue Sections:
◦ Cut 5-10 µm sections from FFPE blocks and place on
slides.
◦ Deparaffinize sections in xylene and rehydrate through
graded alcohols to water.
2. DNA Isolation:
◦ Use the DNA extraction kit according to the manufacturer's
instructions for FFPE samples.
◦ Quantify DNA yield using Qubit fluorometer or equivalent.
B) Library Preparation:
1. Amplification:
◦ Perform PCR amplification of the FOXL2 gene using
specific primers.
◦ Confirm successful amplification via gel electrophoresis.
2. Library Construction:
◦ Use the library preparation kit to create NGS libraries from
the amplified DNA.
◦ Quantify and assess the quality of the libraries using a
Bioanalyzer or TapeStation.
C) Sequencing:
1. Loading:
◦ Load the prepared libraries into the NGS platform according
to manufacturer's instructions.
◦ Perform sequencing run. Ensure all necessary controls are
included in the sequencing run.
D) Data Analysis:
1. Initial Processing:
◦ Use sequencing data analysis software to align reads to the
reference genome.
◦ Identify variants, focusing on mutations in the FOXL2 gene.
2. Variant Annotation:
◦ Annotate identified variants using appropriate databases
and tools (e.g., ClinVar, COSMIC).
3. Interpretation:
◦ Interpret the clinical significance of identified FOXL2
mutations in the context of the tumor pathology.
◦ Verify interpreted results through secondary analysis if
necessary.
E) Quality Control:
• Include known positive and negative controls in each batch of
samples processed.
• Monitor the performance and maintenance of all equipment
according to established schedules.
• Ensure replicability by performing duplicate tests on a subset of
samples.
F) Reporting Results:
1. Documentation:
◦ Document all steps, including DNA quantification, library
preparation, sequencing run details, data analysis, and
quality control in the laboratory information system.
2. Report Generation:
◦ Generate a comprehensive report detailing the identified
FOXL2 mutations and their clinical significance.
◦ Review and verify results by a qualified technologist before
issuing the final report.
3. Critical Results:
◦ Communicate critical or unexpected mutations immediately
to the requesting clinician, according to the laboratory's
critical result notification policy.
4. Storage of Data and Specimens:
◦ Store sequencing data securely on the laboratory's data
storage system.
◦ Archive raw data for at least five years.
◦ Retain DNA samples as per institutional policy for potential
further analysis.
