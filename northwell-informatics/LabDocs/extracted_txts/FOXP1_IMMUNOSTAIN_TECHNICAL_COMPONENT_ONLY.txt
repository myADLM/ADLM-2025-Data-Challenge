Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for FOXP1 Immunostain,
Technical Component Only
1. PURPOSE
This SOP describes the process for performing the technical
component of the FOXP1 immunostain, ensuring consistency,
reliability, and accuracy in the staining process.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of trained laboratory personnel to perform the
FOXP1 immunostain as per the procedures outlined in this
document. It is also their responsibility to report any issues or
deviations to a designated supervisor immediately.
1. SPECIMEN
3.1 Acceptable Specimen:
• Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections.
3.2 Unacceptable Specimen:
• Specimens not adequately fixed in formalin.
• Tissue sections inadequately processed and embedded in
paraffin.
1. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
4.1 Equipment:
• Microtome
• Water bath
• Oven
• Immunostaining automated platform (i.e., Ventana BenchMark
ULTRA, Leica BOND)
• Microscope
4.2 Reagents and Supplies:
• FOXP1 primary antibody
• Positive and negative control slides
• Xylene
• Ethanol (100%, 95%, 80%, 70%)
• Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)
• Antigen retrieval solution
• Secondary antibody (with detection system compatible with
primary antibody)
• Chromogen solution (e.g., DAB substrate)
• Hematoxylin
• Mounting medium
• Glass slides and coverslips
1. PROCEDURE
5.1 Preparation:
• Cut 4-5 µm sections from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded
tissue blocks.
• Float sections on a water bath and place them on glass slides.
• Dry slides in an oven at 60°C for at least 30 minutes.
5.2 Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
• Deparaffinize slides in 3 changes of xylene for 5 minutes each.
• Rehydrate slides through graded ethanol series: 100%, 95%,
80%, 70% (2 minutes each).
• Rinse slides in tap water for 5 minutes.
5.3 Antigen Retrieval:
• Perform antigen retrieval using the appropriate solution (e.g.,
citrate buffer, pH 6.0) either by microwave or automated
instrument protocols as per manufacturer's instructions.
5.4 Immunostaining:
• Load slides onto the immunostaining platform.
• Apply primary FOXP1 antibody according to the recommended
dilution and incubation time (refer to manufacturer's guidelines).
• Rinse slides with PBS buffer.
• Apply secondary antibody (HRP-conjugated) and incubate as per
manufacturer's guidelines.
• Rinse slides with PBS buffer.
• Apply chromogen solution (e.g., DAB) and incubate until the
desired stain intensity is achieved. Monitor reaction under the
microscope.
• Rinse with distilled water.
5.5 Counterstaining and Mounting:
• Counterstain with hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes.
• Wash slides in tap water for 2 minutes.
• Dehydrate in graded ethanol series (70%, 80%, 95%, 100%) (2
minutes each).
• Clear slides in 3 changes of xylene for 5 minutes each.
• Mount with mounting medium and coverslip.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
6.1 Controls:
• Run both positive and negative control slides with each batch of
samples to ensure staining quality and specificity.
• Positive controls: Tissue known to express FOXP1.
• Negative controls: Tissue known not to express FOXP1 or
omission of primary antibody.
6.2 Assessment:
• Verify the presence of appropriate staining on control slides
before interpreting patient results.
• Evaluate the staining pattern and intensity under a microscope.
1. DOCUMENTATION
• Record all pertinent information such as reagent lot numbers,
expiration dates, and any deviations from the protocol.
• Maintain an Immunostain Quality Control Log documenting the
staining outcomes and any corrective actions taken.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING
• Weak or absent staining: Verify the integrity of primary antibody
and reagents. Check antigen retrieval conditions.
• High background staining: Ensure adequate washing steps and
verify the specificity of secondary antibody.
• Irregular staining: Inspect tissue sectioning quality and ensure
even reagent application.

1. REVISION HISTORY
• Document any changes or updates made to the SOP and provide
a history of revisions, including the date and nature of the change.
This protocol ensures the consistent technical performance of
FOXP1 immunostaining in the laboratory. All staff members must
follow this SOP and report any deviations immediately to a
supervisor.
