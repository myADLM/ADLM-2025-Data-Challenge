SOP for FOXP3 Immunostain, Technical Component Only
1. PURPOSE
To ensure proper analytical procedures for the detection of FOXP3 in
tissue samples using immunohistochemical staining techniques,
providing high-quality and consistent technical results.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of all designated laboratory staff to perform the
immunostain according to this established protocol. The
completeness and accuracy of each step are paramount to ensure
the reliability of the results.
2. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• Microtome
• Water bath
• Positive charged glass slides
• Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue blocks
• Xylene, ethanol (100%, 95%, 70%)
• FOXP3 primary antibody
• Secondary antibody (Anti-Mouse or Anti-Rabbit)
• DAB Substrate Kit (3,3’-diaminobenzidine)
• Washing buffer (PBS)
• Antigen retrieval solution (e.g., citrate buffer pH 6.0 or EDTA
buffer pH 9.0)
• Incubator
• Mounting medium and coverslips
• Hematoxylin for counterstaining
3. PROCEDURE
3.1 Preparation of Tissue Sections
• Cut 4-5 µm thick sections from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded
tissue blocks using a microtome.
• Float sections on the water bath set at 40-45°C.
• Mount sections onto positive charged glass slides and dry
overnight at 37°C or for at least 1 hour at 60°C.
3.2 Deparaffinization and Rehydration
• Deparaffinize slides in xylene for 3 x 5 minutes.
• Rehydrate by passing through graded ethanol series (100%, 2 x
95%, 70%) for 3 minutes each.
• Rinse in distilled water for 3 minutes.
3.3 Antigen Retrieval
• Perform antigen retrieval by immersing slides in a retrieval
solution (citrate buffer pH 6.0 or EDTA buffer pH 9.0) using a
preheated water bath or steamer at 95-98°C for 20 minutes.
• Allow slides to cool at room temperature for 20 minutes.
• Rinse slides in PBS or running tap water for 5 minutes.
3.4 Blocking
• To block endogenous peroxidase activity, incubate sections in 3%
hydrogen peroxide in methanol for 10 minutes.
• Rinse in PBS for 3 minutes.
3.5 Primary Antibody Incubation
• Apply the FOXP3 primary antibody to each section, ensuring
complete coverage. Incubate at room temperature for 1 hour or
overnight at 4°C.
• Rinse slides in PBS for 3 x 3 minutes.
3.6 Secondary Antibody Incubation
• Apply secondary antibody (such as biotinylated anti-mouse/rabbit
IgG) and incubate for 30 minutes at room temperature.
• Rinse slides in PBS for 3 x 3 minutes.
3.7 Detection and Visualization
• Apply DAB substrate to slides and incubate until color develops
(usually 3-10 minutes). Monitor staining development under a
microscope.
• Rinse thoroughly in distilled water.
3.8 Counterstaining
• Counterstain slides with hematoxylin for 30 seconds to 1 minute.
• Rinse in running tap water for 5 minutes.
• Dehydrate through graded ethanol series (70%, 95%, 2 x 100%),
clear in xylene 2 x 5 minutes.
3.9 Mounting
• Apply mounting medium and coverslip carefully to avoid air
bubbles.
3.10 Quality Control
• Include known positive and negative control slides to ensure the
accuracy of the staining procedure.
• Document any deficiencies and take appropriate action as
needed.
4. REPORTING RESULTS
• Technical results should be documented accurately without any
interpretation.
• Ensure that slides are properly labeled and delivered to the
pathologist for evaluation.
5. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions for FOXP3 antibody and detection kit
• Laboratory’s internal guidelines and manuals on
immunohistochemical staining
6. SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS
• Follow all laboratory safety protocols and wear appropriate
personal protective equipment (PPE) during the procedure.
• Dispose of waste materials according to laboratory safety and
hazardous waste disposal guidelines.
7. RECORD KEEPING
• Maintain records of all staining procedures including batch
numbers of antibodies and reagents, dates of use, and outcomes
of quality control checks.
