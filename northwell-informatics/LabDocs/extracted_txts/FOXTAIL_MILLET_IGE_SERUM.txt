Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Generating Results for
FoxTail Millet, IgE, Serum
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the standardized procedure for the analysis of
Foxtail Millet-specific Immunoglobulin E (IgE) in serum samples to
ensure consistency, accuracy, and reliability of results.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing
the analysis as outlined in this SOP.
• Supervisors must ensure that the procedure is followed and that
appropriate corrective actions are taken when necessary.
1. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS
• Wear appropriate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) including
gloves, lab coat, and safety goggles.
• Follow laboratory biosafety protocols to handle human serum
specimens.
1. REAGENTS, EQUIPMENT, AND MATERIALS
• Reagents:
◦ Foxtail Millet-specific IgE ELISA (Enzyme-Linked
Immunosorbent Assay) kit
◦ Wash buffer, substrate solution, stop solution, standards, and
controls
• Equipment:
◦ Microplate reader (capable of reading at 450 nm)
◦ Incubator (set at 37°C)
◦ Precision pipettes and disposable pipette tips
◦ ELISA plate washer or manual washing setup
◦ Timer
• Materials:
◦ 96-well microtiter plates
◦ Standard laboratory glassware
◦ Paper towels or absorbent pads for blotting
◦ Lab marker
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STORAGE
• Preferred Specimen: Fresh serum
• Specimen Collection: Collect blood using standard venipuncture
technique. Allow blood to clot, then centrifuge to separate serum.
• Storage: Serum samples can be stored at 2-8°C for up to 7 days.
For long-term storage, freeze at -20°C or below.
• Unacceptable Specimens: Hemolyzed, lipemic, or otherwise
visibly contaminated samples.
• Thaw frozen specimens completely and mix well before analysis.
Do not repeatedly freeze and thaw the specimens.
1. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Allow all reagents, samples, and controls to reach room
temperature before beginning the assay.
2. Carefully read the instructions provided in the FoxTail Millet-
specific IgE ELISA kit.
Assay Procedure:
1. Plate Preparation:
◦ Label the microtiter plate with the appropriate number of
wells for standards, controls, and patient samples.
◦ Add 100 µL of standards, controls, and patient samples to
the appropriate wells.
◦ Perform all standards and controls in duplicate.
2. Incubation and Washing:
◦ Cover the plate with adhesive film or a plate cover.
◦ Incubate the plate at 37°C for the time specified in the kit
instructions (usually 30-60 minutes).
◦ Wash the plate according to the kit's instructions, typically
3-5 times with wash buffer. For manual washing, ensure
each well is completely filled and emptied during each wash
cycle.
3. Secondary Antibody Addition:
◦ Add the specified amount of enzyme-conjugated secondary
antibody to each well.
◦ Incubate the plate at 37°C for the time listed in the kit
instructions (typically 30 minutes).
4. Final Wash and Substrate Addition:
◦ Wash the plate as done previously.
◦ Add the substrate solution to each well. Incubate the plate in
the dark at room temperature for the duration specified in
the kit instruction (usually 15-30 minutes).
5. Stop Reaction:
◦ Add the stop solution to each well in the same order as the
substrate solution.
6. Reading the Plate:
◦ Measure the absorbance at 450 nm using a microplate
reader within 30 minutes of adding the stop solution.
◦ Use the microplate reader's software to generate the
standard curve and calculate the IgE concentrations of the
samples.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run controls and standards with each batch of samples assayed.
• Verify that the standards fall within the expected range.
• If controls do not fall within the specified range, troubleshoot and
rerun the assay. Do not report results until valid controls are
obtained.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Report IgE concentrations in IU/mL.
• Results will be categorized based on established reference
intervals as described below:
Reference Intervals:
• Negative: <0.35 IU/mL
• Low Positive: 0.35 - 0.69 IU/mL
• Moderate Positive: 0.70 - 3.49 IU/mL
• High Positive: ≥3.50 IU/mL
1. LIMITATIONS
• Results should be correlated with the patient's clinical history,
symptoms, and other diagnostic tests.
• Unsuitable samples such as hemolyzed or lipemic specimens
may cause erroneous results.
• Ensure all reagents and specimens are at appropriate
temperatures before starting the assay to ensure accurate results.
