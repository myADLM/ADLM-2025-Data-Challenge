SOP for Fragile X Follow-Up Analysis
1. PURPOSE:
To outline the procedures and responsibilities for the analysis of
specimens for Fragile X screening and follow-up testing within the
laboratory to ensure accurate and reliable test results.
Responsibility:
Designated and trained laboratory personnel shall perform the
analysis of Fragile X specimens according to this SOP. The
designated supervisor is responsible for ensuring the procedures are
adhered to and for addressing any discrepancies or issues reported
by the lab staff.
1. SCOPE:
This procedure applies to all steps of the analytical phase for Fragile
X follow-up testing once the specimen has been collected, received,
and accessioned.
1. EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS:
• PCR Thermocycler
• Capillary Electrophoresis System (e.g., ABI 3130 Genetic
Analyzer)
• Fragile X PCR Kit
• DNA extraction kit
• Standard laboratory micropipettes and tips
• Agarose gel electrophoresis apparatus
• Ethidium bromide or an alternative DNA stain
• UV Transilluminator
• Gel documentation system
• Laboratory timer
• Vortex mixer
• Microcentrifuge
• PCR tubes and plates
1. PROCEDURE:
a. DNA Extraction:
i) Specify sample type received (e.g., blood, buccal swab). ii) Extract
genomic DNA from the specimen using a DNA extraction kit as per
the manufacturer's instructions. iii) Quantify and assess the quality of
the extracted DNA using a spectrophotometer or fluorometer. iv)
Store extracted DNA at -20°C until ready for PCR amplification.
b. PCR Amplification:
i) Thaw all necessary reagents and DNA samples on ice. ii) Prepare
the PCR master mix according to the Fragile X PCR Kit’s instructions.
iii) Aliquot the master mix into labelled PCR tubes or plates. iv) Add
the DNA samples to the appropriate wells/tubes. v) Include positive
and negative controls in each run. vi) Seal the tubes or plate, and
load them into the PCR Thermocycler. vii) Run the PCR program as
per the manufacturer's instructions.
c. Gel Electrophoresis:
i) Prepare a 1-2% agarose gel. ii) Mix PCR products with loading dye.
iii) Load samples into the gel wells along with a suitable DNA ladder.
iv) Run the gel at 100-120V until the markers are adequately
separated. v) Stain the gel with ethidium bromide or alternative DNA
stain. vi) Visualize the gel using a UV transilluminator. vii) Document
and image the gel using the gel documentation system.
d. Capillary Electrophoresis:
i) Prepare the capillary electrophoresis system according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. ii) Load the PCR products and size
standards into the appropriate wells of a 96-well plate. iii) Run the
capillary electrophoresis program to separate the PCR products. iv)
Analyze the results using the associated genetic analysis software to
determine the Fragile X allele sizes.
1. INTERPRETATION AND REPORTING OF RESULTS:
i) Interpret results based on the allele size ranges provided in the
Fragile X PCR Kit instructions. ii) Document all controls and ensure
they fall within the specified ranges for validity. iii) Report results as
either normal, intermediate, premutation, or full mutation based on
CGG repeat expansions. iv) All results must be reviewed and verified
by a qualified technologist and a designated supervisor.
1. QUALITY CONTROL:
i) Include positive, negative, and known-size controls in each run. ii)
Ensure all equipment is calibrated and maintained as per laboratory
procedures. iii) Document any anomalies and perform corrective
actions if control results fall outside acceptable ranges.
1. DOCUMENTATION:
i) Record all specimen information, test conditions, and results in the
laboratory information system (LIS). ii) Maintain detailed logs for
equipment maintenance, calibrations, and quality control results.
