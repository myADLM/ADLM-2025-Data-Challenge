Standard Operating Procedures - Protocol for Analytical Phase
of Generating Results for Fragile X Syndrome
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the analytical procedures for
generating results for Fragile X Syndrome testing. This includes
detailed procedures for sample preparation, DNA extraction,
polymerase chain reaction (PCR), capillary electrophoresis, Southern
Blot analysis, result interpretation, quality control measures, and
reporting results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing all
procedures as defined in this SOP. Lab personnel are also
responsible for documenting all steps accurately and ensuring quality
control measures are implemented and maintained.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred Specimen: 2-5 mL of whole blood collected in an EDTA
tube.
• Specimen Handling: Blood samples must be stored at 4°C if
processing is delayed for up to 5 days. For longer storage, freeze
at -20°C or -80°C.
4. PROCEDURE
A. DNA Extraction
1. Label all specimen tubes with the unique identifier of the
patient.
2. Use a commercial DNA extraction kit following the
manufacturer’s instructions, ensuring the concentration and
purity of DNA are adequate for downstream applications (A260/
A280 ratio of 1.8-2.0).
3. Document DNA concentration and storage conditions.
B. Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)
1. Prepare the PCR Master Mix according to the manufacturer’s
guidelines, including primers specific for CGG repeat region of
FMR1 gene.
2. Pipette DNA template and Master Mix into each reaction tube.
3. Perform PCR in a thermal cycler with the following cycling
conditions:
◦ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 5 minutes
◦ Denaturation: 95°C for 30 seconds
◦ Annealing: 55°C for 30 seconds
◦ Extension: 72°C for 1 minute
◦ Final extension: 72°C for 10 minutes
4. Analyze PCR products on a 2% agarose gel to verify
amplification.
C. Capillary Electrophoresis
1. Prepare the capillary electrophoresis (CE) instrument following
the manufacturer's protocol.
2. Load PCR products mixed with a size standard into the CE
instrument.
3. Run the samples under conditions suitable for detecting large
CGG repeat expansions.
4. Collect and analyze the data using the instrument’s software.
D. Southern Blot Analysis (for large expansions undetectable by
PCR)
1. Digest the extracted DNA with appropriate restriction enzymes.
2. Separate the digested products by agarose gel electrophoresis.
3. Transfer the DNA to a nylon membrane by Southern blotting
technique.
4. Hybridize the membrane with a labeled probe specific for the
FMR1 CGG repeat region.
5. Wash and detect the hybridized probe using chemiluminescent
substrates.
6. Document and analyze the Southern Blot results.
E. Result Interpretation
1. Interpret PCR and CE results for each patient.
◦ Normal Range: 5-44 repeats
◦ Intermediate Range: 45-54 repeats
◦ Premutation Range: 55-200 repeats
◦ Full Mutation: >200 repeats
2. Validate findings with Southern Blot results for larger
expansions.
3. Confirm test results by comparing them against known
standards and controls.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Perform DNA extraction controls and include positive and
negative controls in every PCR run.
2. Include internal size standards in all CE runs.
3. Verify fragment sizes against control samples.
4. Document all control results and ensure they fall within
acceptable ranges.
5. If control results are outside acceptable ranges, troubleshoot
the assay, repeat if necessary, and document any corrective
actions taken.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Record findings in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
2. Review and verify results by a qualified laboratory technologist.
3. Generate a comprehensive report including:
◦ Patient Identifier
◦ Testing Methodology
◦ Results (number of CGG repeats)
◦ Interpretation of Results
◦ Comments on sample integrity, if necessary
4. Release results to the referring physician as per laboratory
guidelines.
7. METHOD LIMITATIONS
1. PCR and CE may not detect large CGG repeat expansions
accurately. Southern Blot is recommended for confirmation.
2. Contaminated or degraded DNA may lead to inconclusive
results.
3. Carefully interpret intermediate results, considering possible
mosaicism.
