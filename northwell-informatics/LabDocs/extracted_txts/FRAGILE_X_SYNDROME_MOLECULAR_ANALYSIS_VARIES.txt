Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Analytical Phase: Generating Results for Fragile X Syndrome
Molecular Analysis
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to outline the steps necessary for
generating reliable and accurate results for Fragile X Syndrome
molecular analysis. This includes the preparation, execution, and
documentation of molecular tests using PCR and Southern blot
methods. These analysis steps will ensure that the laboratory
provides consistent and dependable results for diagnostic purposes.
Responsibility: Designated molecular biology technologists and
supervisors are responsible for conducting the testing and ensuring
results are accurate and reliable. It is also their responsibility to
maintain the integrity, confidentiality, and security of patient
information throughout the testing process.
1. DEFINITIONS AND ABBREVIATIONS
• Fragile X Syndrome (FXS): A genetic condition causing
intellectual disability, behavioral and learning challenges, and
various physical characteristics.
• PCR: Polymerase Chain Reaction, a technique used to amplify
DNA segments.
• Southern Blot: A method used for DNA fragment detection in a
DNA sample.
Equipment and Supplies:
• Thermal cycler for PCR
• Gel electrophoresis apparatus
• Reagents (Taq polymerase, primers, dNTPs, buffer)
• Agarose and Southern blotting supplies
• Centrifuge
• DNA extraction kits
• Positive and negative controls
1. PROCEDURE
3.1 DNA Extraction:
1. Use an appropriate genomic DNA extraction kit as per the
manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Quantify DNA concentration using a spectrophotometer, record
the results and ensure the DNA is in the acceptable
concentration range (20-200 ng/µL).
3. Store extracted DNA at -20°C if not used immediately.
3.2 Amplification by PCR:
1. Prepare the PCR reaction mix:
◦ 1X PCR buffer
◦ 0.2 mM dNTPs
◦ 0.2 µM forward primer
◦ 0.2 µM reverse primer
◦ 1.5 mM MgCl2
◦ 1.0 unit Taq polymerase
◦ Sterile water to final volume of 25 µL per reaction
2. Add 2 µL of DNA template (20-200 ng) to each reaction tube.
3. Set up the thermocycler program:
◦ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 5 minutes
◦ 35 cycles of:
▪ Denaturation: 95°C for 30 seconds
▪ Annealing: 60°C for 30 seconds
▪ Extension: 72°C for 1 minute
◦ Final extension: 72°C for 10 minutes
4. Run PCR products on a 2% agarose gel to confirm
amplification.
3.3 Southern Blot Analysis:
1. Digest 10 µg of genomic DNA with a restriction enzyme (e.g.,
EcoRI).
2. Separate digested DNA by agarose gel electrophoresis (0.8%).
3. Transfer DNA from the gel to a nylon membrane.
4. Prepare and label a DNA probe specific to the FMR1 repeat
region.
5. Hybridize the probe to the membrane.
6. Wash the membrane to remove nonspecifically bound probe.
7. Detect bound probe using appropriate detection reagent.
3.4 Interpretation and Reporting:
1. Compare gel electrophoresis results and Southern blot bands
with known fragile X patterns.
2. Use positive and negative controls to validate each run.
3. Document all observations and results in the laboratory
information system (LIS).
4. Interpret the test results as follows:
◦ Normal: CGG repeat size within normal range
◦ Premutation: Intermediate repeat size
◦ Full mutation: Large (>200 CGG repeats) expansion
3.5 Quality Control:
1. Include positive and negative controls in each batch of samples
tested.
2. Perform bi-weekly and monthly internal quality control checks
with known samples.
3. Record and review QC results to ensure assay performance is
within acceptable limits.
4. Repeat assays if QC results are out of range, perform
troubleshooting if necessary.
3.6 Documentation and Review:
1. Ensure all steps and observations are recorded in detail in the
laboratory logbook.
2. Results must be reviewed and verified by a supervisory
technologist before reporting.
3. Document any deviations from standard protocol and the
actions taken to resolve them.
