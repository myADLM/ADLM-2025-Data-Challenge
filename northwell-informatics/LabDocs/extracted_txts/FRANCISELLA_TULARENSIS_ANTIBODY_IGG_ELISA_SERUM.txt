Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Francisella tularensis Antibody, IgG,
ELISA, Serum
1. PURPOSE
To ensure consistent and accurate detection of Francisella tularensis
IgG antibodies from serum samples using the ELISA method.
Responsibility: Personnel conducting this test must be adequately
trained and competent in ELISA techniques. It is the responsibility of
the staff and supervisors to ensure proper adherence to this protocol
to maintain test accuracy and reliability.
1. SCOPE
This procedure covers the analytical phase for testing Francisella
tularensis IgG antibodies in serum using the ELISA method.
1. DEFINITIONS
• ELISA: Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay
• IgG: Immunoglobulin G
• EIA: Enzyme Immunoassay
• HRP: Horseradish Peroxidase
• TMB: Tetramethylbenzidine
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Type: Serum
• Collection: Collect whole blood using standard venipuncture
techniques. Allow blood to clot, and then centrifuge to separate
the serum.
• Volume: Approx. 5 mL of whole blood to yield about 2 mL of
serum
• Stability: Serum samples should be stored at 2-8°C if tested within
48 hours, otherwise stored at -20°C or lower for long-term
storage.
1. REAGENTS AND EQUIPMENT
• ELISA Kit for Francisella tularensis IgG
• Plate Reader (set at 450 nm with a 620-650 nm reference filter)
• Micropipettes and tips
• Wash Buffer (PBS with 0.05% Tween-20)
• Diluent
• TMB Substrate
• Stop Solution (usually 1N H2SO4)
• Deionized or distilled water
• Calibrated Timer
• Incubator set to 37°C
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation:
1. Bring all reagents to room temperature (20-25°C) before use.
2. Prepare wash buffer if not pre-diluted.
3. Carefully read the manufacturer's kit insert for specific
preparation instructions.
B. Assay Procedure:
1. Sample and Control Preparation:
◦ Dilute patient serum samples 1:100 in exactly measured
diluent as specified by the kit insert.
◦ Prepare positive and negative controls.
2. Plate Setup:
◦ Clearly label the microtiter plate or strip wells for controls,
calibrators, and patient samples.
◦ Add 100 µL of diluted controls, calibrators, and patient
samples into their respective wells.
3. Incubation:
◦ Cover the plate with adhesive foil and incubate for 30
minutes at 37°C.
◦ Remove the foil and wash the plate 3-5 times with wash
buffer to remove unbound antibodies. Ensure no residual
liquid remains in the wells by tapping the plate on absorbent
paper.
4. Conjugate Addition:
◦ Add 100 µL of enzyme-HRP conjugate to each well.
◦ Cover the plate and incubate for 30 minutes at 37°C.
◦ Wash the plate as previously described.
5. Substrate Addition:
◦ Add 100 µL of TMB substrate solution to each well.
◦ Incubate the plate at room temperature (20-25°C) in the
dark for 15 minutes.
6. Stop Reaction:
◦ Add 100 µL of stop solution to each well to halt the reaction.
◦ Gently tap the plate to ensure thorough mixing.
7. Read Plate:
◦ Read the absorbance at 450 nm within 10 minutes of
stopping the reaction. Use a reference wavelength of
620-650 nm.
8. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
• Determine the cutoff value based on the mean absorbance of the
negative controls plus a predetermined factor as per the kit insert.
• Calculate and interpret the results according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
• Report results as Positive, Negative, or Indeterminate based on
the absorption values relative to the cutoff.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Ensure all controls yield expected results. If not, review
procedures and equipment calibration.
• Run both positive and negative controls with each batch of tests.
• Document all control results in the QC log.
1. RESULT REPORTING
• Verify results before reporting. Flag and note any indeterminate
results or errors.
• Use the laboratory’s LIS (Laboratory Information System) to
record results.
• Report positive results immediately to the appropriate medical
staff for patient follow-up.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING and NOTES
• If samples show high background signal, revalidate washing steps
and reagent contamination.
• Check for expiration dates on all reagents and replace if
necessary.
• If unexpected results occur, repeat the test or check with an
alternative method.
