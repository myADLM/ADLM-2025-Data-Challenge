Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for FRANCISELLA
TULARENSIS ANTIBODY, IGM AND IGG, ELISA, SERUM
1. PURPOSE: The purpose of this procedure is to provide detailed
steps for the analysis of FRANCISELLA TULARENSIS
ANTIBODY, IGM AND IGG in serum samples using the ELISA
method. This procedure ensures accurate and reliable testing
following Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)
standards.
2. SCOPE: This procedure applies to all trained laboratory
personnel and covers all steps from specimen preparation to
result interpretation and reporting.
3. RESPONSIBILITY:
• Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing
the analysis.
• Supervisors are responsible for reviewing results to ensure quality
and accuracy.
• Laboratory personnel must ensure proper documentation of all
activities and maintain compliance with the SOP and related
regulatory requirements.
1. SPECIMEN: A. Preferred Specimen: - Serum collected in a red-
top or serum separator tube (SST). - Minimum volume: 1 mL
serum. B. Unacceptable Specimens: - Specimens that are
hemolyzed, lipemic, or contaminated. - Specimens collected in
incorrect tubes or not properly labeled.
2. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES: Equipment: -
ELISA microplate reader with 450 nm filter. - Microplate washer.
- Incubator set at 37°C. Reagents: - FRANCISELLA
TULARENSIS ANTIBODY ELISA kit (including antigen-coated
plates, conjugate, substrate, stop solution, and control sera).
Supplies: - Micropipettes and tips. - Calibration and quality
control materials. - Timer. - Plate sealers.
3. PROCEDURE:
A. PREPARATION:
◦ Bring all reagents and specimens to room temperature
before use.
◦ Thoroughly mix all reagents and control sera.
◦ Prepare all necessary reagents according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
B. ASSAY PROCEDURE:
1. Plate Setup:
▪ Label the microplate appropriately for standards,
controls, and patient samples.
▪ Add 100 µL of each standard, control, and patient
sample to the designated wells.
2. Incubation:
▪ Seal the plate with a plate sealer and incubate at 37°C
for 1 hour.
3. Washing:
▪ Wash the wells thoroughly with the provided wash
buffer (using a plate washer or manually).
▪ Repeat the washing step 3 times, then blot the plate to
remove residual liquid.
4. Conjugate Addition:
▪ Add 100 µL of enzyme conjugate to each well.
▪ Incubate the plate at 37°C for 30 minutes.
5. Washing:
▪ Wash the wells thoroughly 4 times with wash buffer.
▪ Blot dry.
6. Substrate Addition:
▪ Add 100 µL of the TMB substrate to each well.
▪ Incubate in the dark at room temperature for 15
minutes.
7. Stopping Reaction:
▪ Add 100 µL of stop solution to each well to stop the
reaction.
▪ Gently tap the plate to ensure mixing.
C. MEASUREMENT:
◦ Measure the absorbance of each well at 450 nm using an
ELISA microplate reader within 30 minutes of adding stop
solution.
D. INTERPRETATION:
◦ Create a standard curve by plotting the absorbance values
of the standards against their concentrations.
◦ Calculate the concentration of IgM and IgG antibodies in
patient samples by extrapolating from the standard curve.
4. QUALITY CONTROL:
◦ Run positive and negative controls with each batch of tests
to ensure assay performance.
◦ Verify that control values fall within established ranges
before reporting patient results.
◦ Document all control results and any deviations observed.
5. REPORTING RESULTS:
◦ Transmit calculated results to the LIS (Laboratory
Information System).
◦ All results must be reviewed and verified by technologists
before being reported to the requesting physician.
◦ Report the results following the site-specific reporting
guidelines.
6. REFERENCE INTERVALS:
◦ Negative: < 1:20
◦ Equivocal: 1:20 - 1:40
◦ Positive: > 1:40
7. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
• Cross-reactivity with other pathogens may affect the specificity of
the test.
• Proper handling and preparation of samples and reagents are
critical to avoid false results.

1. REVIEW SCHEDULE:
• This SOP will be reviewed annually or as necessary per
laboratory policy.
