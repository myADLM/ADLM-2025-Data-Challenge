Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
1. PURPOSE:
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the process for performing
FRANCISELLA TULARENSIS ANTIBODY, IgM AND IgG, SERUM
test, including the technical interpretation of the results. This
procedure ensures accurate and reliable detection of antibodies
specific to Francisella tularensis in serum specimens.
2. SCOPE:
This procedure applies to laboratory personnel who are trained and
authorized to perform serological testing for Francisella tularensis
antibodies.
3. RESPONSIBILITY:
• Laboratory Technicians: Conduct the assay according to this
SOP, ensure proper maintenance of equipment, validate results,
and document findings.
• Supervisors: Review and verify results, ensure adherence to
quality control procedures, and provide corrective actions when
necessary.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS:
• Specimen Type: Serum
• Collection: Collect 5-10 mL of whole blood in a red-top tube.
Allow the blood to clot at room temperature and centrifuge to
separate serum.
• Storage: Serum specimens should be stored at 2-8°C if analysis
is to be performed within 48 hours. For longer storage, specimens
must be frozen at -20°C or colder.
• Unacceptable Specimens: Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric
specimens may not be suitable for testing. Reject specimens that
do not meet these criteria.
5. REAGENTS AND EQUIPMENT:
• Reagents:
◦ Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) Kit for
Francisella tularensis IgM and IgG antibodies.
• Equipment:
◦ Microplate reader capable of reading absorbance at
appropriate wavelengths specified by the ELISA kit.
◦ Pipettes and disposable pipette tips.
◦ Microcentrifuge tubes.
◦ Timer.
◦ Incubator (37°C).
6. PROCEDURE:
A. Preparation:
1. Bring all reagents and specimens to room temperature before
starting the assay.
2. Label microplate wells for patient specimens, controls, and
standards as per the assay layout provided by the kit
manufacturer.
B. Assay Procedure:
1. Pipette the specified volume of standards, controls, and patient
sera into designated wells.
2. Follow the specific instructions provided in the ELISA kit for the
addition of reagents, incubation times, and washing steps.
3. Add the substrate solution and incubate for the time specified in
the kit insert.
4. Stop the reaction by adding the stop solution provided in the kit.
5. Measure the absorbance of each well at the specified
wavelength using a microplate reader.
C. Quality Control:
1. Include positive and negative controls provided with the ELISA
kit in each assay run.
2. Ensure that the control values are within the ranges specified
by the kit manufacturer before interpreting patient results.
7. RESULT INTERPRETATION:
• Data Analysis:
1. Calculate the mean absorbance for each standard, control,
and patient serum sample.
2. Plot standard curve data and determine the concentration of
IgM and IgG antibodies in patient sera using the curve.
• Interpretation Criteria:
◦ Positive: Absorbance values indicate the presence of specific
IgM or IgG antibodies to Francisella tularensis.
◦ Negative: Absorbance values indicate the absence of specific
IgM or IgG antibodies to Francisella tularensis.
◦ Indeterminate: Absorbance values fall into a range where
results are inconclusive. Repeat testing may be necessary.
• Reporting Results:
1. Document the results in the laboratory information system
(LIS).
2. Provide a clear interpretation based on established
reference ranges.
3. If results are critical, follow the laboratory protocol for
communicating urgent results to the requesting healthcare
provider.
8. LIMITATIONS:
• Cross-reactivity with other bacterial antibodies may occur. Clinical
correlation is essential to confirm the diagnosis.
• Timing of sample collection relative to infection onset can affect
antibody levels.
• Factors such as hemolysis, lipemia, or improper handling of
specimens can result in inaccurate results.
9. REFERENCES:
• Manufacturer’s package insert for the ELISA kit.
• Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines.
• Relevant scientific literature and texts on serological testing and
Francisella tularensis.
10. DOCUMENTATION:
• Maintain records of all specimen information, assay results,
quality control data, and any incidents or deviations from this
protocol.
