Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to outline the process for performing
the Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) for the detection
of IgM antibodies against Francisella tularensis in serum specimens.
1. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel trained in ELISA
techniques who are responsible for the performance, interpretation,
and reporting of the Francisella tularensis IgM antibody test.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of qualified laboratory personnel to follow this
procedure accurately to ensure reliable and reproducible results. Lab
supervisors are responsible for ensuring compliance and addressing
any issues that arise during testing.
1. DEFINITION
Francisella tularensis IgM Antibody ELISA: A serological test used to
detect IgM antibodies against Francisella tularensis, the causative
agent of tularemia, in human serum.
1. SPECIMEN COLLECTION AND HANDLING
• Preferred Specimen: 5 mL serum collected in a red-top or serum-
separator (SST) tube.
• Storage: Specimens should be refrigerated at 2-8°C and tested
within 48 hours. If testing is delayed beyond 48 hours, specimens
may be frozen at -20°C or lower.
• Unacceptable Specimens: Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric
specimens may interfere with the test and should be rejected.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• ELISA microplate reader capable of reading at 450 nm
• Adjustable pipettes and disposable pipette tips
• Microplate washer or manual washing equipment
• Incubator set to 37°C
• Timer
• Francisella tularensis IgM ELISA kit, including:
◦ Microplate with immobilized antigen
◦ IgM conjugate reagent
◦ Substrate reagent
◦ Stop solution
◦ Wash buffer
◦ Positive, negative, and cut-off controls
1. PROCEDURE
A) PREPARATION
• Allow all reagents and specimens to reach room temperature
before use.
• Prepare the wash buffer according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
• Prepare a diluted sample by adding 10 µL of the serum specimen
to 990 µL of diluent as per kit instructions (1:100 dilution).
B) ASSAY SET-UP
• Add 100 µL of controls and diluted specimens to the appropriate
wells of the microplate.
• Incubate the plate for 30 minutes at 37°C.
• Wash the plate 3 times with 300 µL of wash buffer per well,
ensuring complete removal of liquid after each wash.
• Add 100 µL of IgM conjugate reagent to each well.
• Incubate the plate for 30 minutes at 37°C.
• Wash the plate 3 times with wash buffer as described above.
• Add 100 µL of substrate reagent to each well.
• Incubate the plate at room temperature (20-25°C) in the dark for
10 minutes.
• Add 100 µL of stop solution to each well to halt the reaction.
C) READING RESULTS
• Read the optical density (OD) of each well at 450 nm using the
ELISA microplate reader within 10 minutes of adding the stop
solution.
• Record the OD values of the controls and patient specimens.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run positive, negative, and cut-off controls with each batch of
tests.
• Review control results: Positive control should yield an OD value
above the cut-off, and negative control should yield an OD value
below the cut-off.
• If control results are out of range, do not report patient results.
Investigate the cause, resolve the issue, and repeat the test
batch.
1. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
• Calculate the ratio of the OD of the test sample to the OD of the
cut-off control.
• Interpret results based on the following criteria:
◦ OD ratio > 1.1: Positive for Francisella tularensis IgM
antibodies
◦ OD ratio 0.9 – 1.1: Indeterminate, consider retesting
◦ OD ratio < 0.9: Negative for Francisella tularensis IgM
antibodies
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Report positive, negative, and indeterminate results as per site-
specific reporting guidelines.
• Indeterminate results may warrant a repeat test or follow-up
sample collection.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• ELISA results should be interpreted in conjunction with clinical
findings and other diagnostic information.
• False positives or false negatives may occur. Ensure all reagents
and controls are properly stored and handled.

kit.
• Relevant clinical guidelines on tularemia serology.
1. REVISION HISTORY
• Document any revisions to the SOP with dates and description of
changes. Ensure personnel are trained on updates.
By following this protocol, laboratory personnel can ensure accurate,
reliable, and reproducible results for the detection of Francisella
tularensis IgM antibodies in serum specimens.
