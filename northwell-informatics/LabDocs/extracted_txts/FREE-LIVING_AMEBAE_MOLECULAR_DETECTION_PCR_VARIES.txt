Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Free-Living Amebae, Molecular Detection, PCR
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for the molecular detection of free-living
amebae using PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) in a CLIA-certified
laboratory. This SOP is intended to ensure consistent, accurate, and
reproducible results while minimizing the risk of contamination.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of trained laboratory personnel to perform the
molecular detection of free-living amebae through PCR following the
standardized procedures outlined below.
1. DEFINITIONS
Free-Living Amebae (FLA): A group of protozoans that are naturally
found in environmental sources such as soil and water and can
sometimes cause human infections.
PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction): A molecular technique used to
amplify DNA sequences, making it possible to detect the presence of
specific pathogens.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Preparation
1. Ensure that the specimen received has been properly
accessioned and labeled.
2. Confirm that the specimen type is acceptable for PCR testing
(e.g., cerebrospinal fluid, tissue biopsy, environmental
samples).
3. Perform initial specimen processing according to laboratory-
specific protocols (e.g., homogenization of tissue samples,
concentration procedures for environmental samples).
B. DNA Extraction
1. Prepare the DNA extraction reagents and supplies according to
the manufacturer's instructions. This may include column-based
or magnetic bead-based extraction kits.
2. Follow the DNA extraction protocol to isolate nucleic acids from
the specimen.
3. Ensure that proper controls (positive and negative) are included
throughout the extraction process.
◦ Positive Control: Known FLA DNA to confirm successful
extraction.
◦ Negative Control: Specimen without FLA to ensure no
contamination.
C. PCR Setup
1. Prepare master mix for PCR as outlined per the manufacturer's
kit instructions. Ensure that all reagents are within their expiry
date.
2. Aliquot the master mix into reaction tubes or PCR plates.
3. Add the extracted DNA or controls to the reaction mix, ensuring
correct volume and concentration.
4. Seal the tubes or plates to prevent contamination.
D. PCR Amplification
1. Place the PCR tubes/plates in the thermal cycler.
2. Set the appropriate cycling conditions according to the specific
PCR kit in use, including denaturation, annealing, and
elongation steps.
3. Start the PCR program and monitor for any issues during
amplification.
E. Post-Amplification Analysis
1. Analyze the PCR products using gel electrophoresis, real-time
PCR detection systems, or other applicable methods.
2. Confirm that the amplicons correspond to the expected size for
FLA detection.
3. Document results for all samples, positive controls, and
negative controls.
◦ Positive Control: Should show a band or signal indicating
successful amplification.
◦ Negative Control: Should show no band or signal, indicating
no contamination.
F. Result Interpretation and Reporting
1. Review all data generated from the PCR amplification and post-
amplification analysis.
2. Verify results using established laboratory guidelines and
quality control measures.
3. Report results according to site-specific reporting guidelines:
◦ Positive Result: Indicating detection of FLA DNA.
◦ Negative Result: Indicating no FLA DNA detected.
◦ Inconclusive Result: If PCR amplification or analysis
controls did not perform as expected.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
A. Internal Controls
1. Positive and negative controls must be included in each batch
of PCR reactions to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the
results.
2. If controls fail, the entire batch of samples must be reprocessed
and reanalyzed.
B. External Controls
1. Participate in proficiency testing programs and external quality
assurance schemes to maintain high standards and validate the
accuracy of the PCR testing.
