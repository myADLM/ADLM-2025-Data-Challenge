Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Measurement of Free
Fatty Acids, Total, Serum
1. PURPOSE This SOP outlines the procedure for the quantitative
measurement of total free fatty acids (FFAs) in serum using an
enzymatic assay.
2. SCOPE This procedure applies to all authorized personnel
performing free fatty acid measurements in the laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY It is the responsibility of the laboratory
personnel to perform the procedure as described, ensuring
quality control and appropriate handling of specimens. It is also
the responsibility of the supervisor to ensure that all personnel
are properly trained in this procedure.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS Preferred Specimen:
• Serum obtained from a blood sample collected in a plain or serum
separator tube (SST).
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens showing signs of hemolysis or lipemia.
• Specimens not labeled properly with patient identification and
collection time.
• Specimens that have not been processed (centrifuged and
separated) within 2 hours of collection.
Specimen Handling and Preparation:
• Allow the blood to clot at room temperature for 30 minutes.
• Centrifuge at 1500-2000g for 10 minutes to separate serum.
• Transfer the serum into a labeled aliquot tube.
• Serum should be stored at 2-8°C if not analyzed immediately; for
long-term storage, keep at -20°C or lower.
1. REAGENTS AND EQUIPMENT
• Enzymatic Free Fatty Acids (FFA) Assay Kit
• Calibrators and controls (two levels: normal and abnormal)
• Pipettes (manual or automated)
• Spectrophotometer capable of reading absorbance at the relevant
wavelength
• Microcuvettes or microplate reader (as per the kit instructions)
• Vortex mixer
1. PROCEDURE
2. Prepare the assay reagents according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
3. Bring all reagents, controls, and serum samples to room
temperature before the assay.
4. Prepare calibration curves using the provided calibrators,
ensuring a blank is included.
5. Pipette the appropriate volume of calibrators, controls, and
patient serum samples into the designated wells/cuvettes.
6. Add the enzymatic reagent mix to each sample, ensuring
thorough mixing without introducing air bubbles.
7. Incubate at the specified temperature for the time indicated in
the assay kit instructions.
8. Measure the absorbance at the designated wavelength (e.g.,
550 nm) using a spectrophotometer or microplate reader.
9. Calculate the concentration of free fatty acids in each serum
sample using the calibration curve.
10. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run quality control samples (normal and abnormal levels) with
every assay run.
• Accept assay results only if quality control values fall within the
predetermined acceptable range.
• Document all quality control activities in the QC log.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Record the calculated concentration of free fatty acids for each
patient sample in the laboratory information system (LIS).
• Verify that all patient identification information matches with the
recorded data.
Reference Intervals:
• Refer to the specific manufacturer’s kit insert for reference
intervals.
• If necessary, adapt reference intervals based on the population
served by the laboratory.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Ensure the absence of hemolysis or lipemia which may interfere
with the assay results.
• Cross-reactivity with other lipid species should be evaluated as
per the kit instructions.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions for the Enzymatic Free Fatty Acid
(FFA) Assay Kit.
1. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS
• Handle all biological specimens as potentially infectious.
• Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) including
lab coat, gloves, and safety goggles.
• Dispose of all waste according to the laboratory’s safety and
waste disposal guidelines.
This SOP for Free Fatty Acids, Total, Serum will be reviewed and
updated as needed to ensure compliance with current laboratory
standards and practices.
