Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for
Generating Results for Free Thyroxine
Index (FTI) in Serum
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standard procedure for the accurate and efficient
determination of Free Thyroxine Index (FTI) in serum samples using
automated or manual methods, ensuring uniformity, reliability, and
precision in reporting results.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel within the clinical
laboratory responsible for performing and reporting Free Thyroxine
Index (FTI) tests.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• All designated staff members must perform FTI tests according to
this SOP.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring all staff members adhere
to this SOP and for conducting regular reviews of procedure
compliance.
• It is the responsibility of all staff to document test results and any
deviations or issues encountered during the testing process.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Automated Immunoassay Analyzer (calibrated and maintained)
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes and tips (calibrated)
• Serum sample collection tubes (SST or plain red top)
• Free Thyroxine (FT4) and Thyroxine-Binding Globulin (TBG)
reagents (store as per manufacturer’s instructions)
• Free Thyroxine Index (FTI) calculation software or manual
calculation tools
• Control materials (low, normal, and high)
• Quality control (QC) logs
• Laboratory Information System (LIS)
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STORAGE
• Preferred specimen: Serum.
◦ Collection tube: Serum Separator Tube (SST) or plain red top
tube.
◦ Volume: At least 2 mL of serum.
• Handling:
◦ Allow the blood sample to clot at room temperature.
◦ Centrifuge the sample at 1500-2000 x g for 10-15 minutes to
separate the serum.
◦ Aliquot the serum into clean, appropriately labeled tubes.
• Storage:
◦ Store serum samples at 2-8°C if analyzed within 48 hours.
◦ For longer storage, freeze serum at -20°C or colder.
6. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation and Handling
1. Upon receipt, verify that the serum samples are properly
labeled and adequately filled, with no signs of hemolysis or
contamination.
2. Allow refrigerated samples to equilibrate to room temperature
before analysis.
B. Instrument Setup and Calibration
1. Ensure the immunoassay analyzer is calibrated and maintained
according to the manufacturer’s specifications.
2. Prepare and load reagents according to the manufacturer’s
instructions for FT4 and TBG tests.
3. Perform a daily calibration check using provided calibrators.
Document calibration in the QC log.
C. Quality Control
1. Run control materials (low, normal, and high) to verify the
performance of each assay:
◦ Include QC samples at the beginning of each run and every
20 samples thereafter.
◦ Document all QC results in the QC log.
2. Verify that controls are within acceptable limits before
proceeding with patient samples. If control results fall outside
acceptable ranges, troubleshoot and recalibrate before
continuing.
D. Analytical Testing
1. For each patient sample, pipette the appropriate volume of
serum into designated sample cups or positions on the analyzer
rack.
2. Enter patient information and sample identification into the
analyzer or LIS.
3. Run the FT4 and TBG assays sequentially according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
4. Upon completion of the assay, review the results for
consistency and accuracy.
E. Calculation of Free Thyroxine Index (FTI)
1. Use the following formula to calculate FTI: FTI = Total T4 (µg/
dL) ÷ TBG (mg/L)
◦ Ensure that Total T4 and TBG values are derived from
validated assays.
2. Verify the calculated FTI manually or through the LIS software
for accuracy.
3. Document the FTI result along with the corresponding FT4 and
TBG values.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Review all calculated FTI results for accuracy and consistency.
2. Enter the results into the LIS for verification and validation.
3. Ensure that results are reported with appropriate reference
intervals and notations.
4. Any critical or significantly abnormal results must be
immediately communicated to the responsible clinician.
8. QUALITY ASSURANCE AND TROUBLESHOOTING
1. Regularly review QC logs and calibration records to ensure
ongoing accuracy and reliability.
2. In case of any deviations, equipment malfunctions, or
inconsistent results, troubleshoot according to the
manufacturer's guidelines and laboratory protocols.
3. Document any corrective actions taken and re-evaluate affected
samples if necessary.
9. STORAGE AND DISPOSAL OF SAMPLES AND
WASTE
1. Store any remaining patient samples at 2-8°C for at least 7
days post-analysis for potential re-evaluation or additional
testing.
2. Dispose of all biological waste, including used reagents and
consumables, in accordance with laboratory safety and
biohazard disposal protocols.
