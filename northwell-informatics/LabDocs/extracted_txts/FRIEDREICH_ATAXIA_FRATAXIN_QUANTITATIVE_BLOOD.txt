Standard Operating Protocol (SOP)
Title: Quantitative Measurement of Frataxin in Blood for Friedreich
Ataxia
1. PURPOSE To outline the procedure for the quantitative
measurement of frataxin levels in blood for the diagnosis and
monitoring of Friedreich Ataxia.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory staff are responsible for
performing the Frataxin, Quantitative assay according to the
described protocol and documenting all relevant data. Supervisors
are responsible for ensuring compliance and addressing any issues
that may arise during the procedure.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS Preferred Specimen:
• Whole blood collected in an EDTA tube.
Acceptable Specimen:
• Whole blood collected in heparin or citrated tubes.
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Specimens arriving more than 48 hours after collection.
• Specimens in tubes other than EDTA, heparin, or citrate.
• Specimens with visible hemolysis or clotting.
• Specimens without proper labeling (e.g., missing collection date/
time or patient information).
Specimen Stability:
• Specimens should be kept at 2-8°C and processed within 48
hours of collection.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Frataxin ELISA Kit
• Plate reader
• Microplate washer
• Calibrated pipettes and tips
• EDTA, heparin, or citrate tubes
• Plate sealers
• Timer
• Vortex mixer
• Centrifuge
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• QC materials should be run with each batch of samples.
• Acceptable QC limits will be set according to manufacturer
instructions.
• Record all QC results in the logbook.
• QC failures must be investigated, and corrective actions
documented.
1. PROCEDURE 5.1 Setup a) Allow all reagents and samples to
come to room temperature before use. b) Ensure all equipment
is calibrated and functioning properly.
5.2 Sample Preparation a) Gently invert EDTA blood tubes to mix. b)
Aliquot a specific volume according to kit instructions. c) Centrifuge
the aliquots at 8000 rpm for 15 minutes to obtain plasma. d) Transfer
plasma to labeled microtubes.
5.3 Assay Procedure a) Prepare standards and controls according to
kit instructions. b) Add assay diluent to each well of the microplate. c)
Add plasma samples, standards, and controls to designated wells. d)
Seal the plate and incubate at room temperature for 2 hours. e) Wash
the plate three times with wash buffer using a microplate washer. f)
Add enzyme conjugate to each well and incubate for 30 minutes at
room temperature. g) Wash plate three times with wash buffer. h) Add
substrate solution to each well and incubate for 15 minutes at room
temperature. i) Add stop solution to each well. j) Read the plate at the
specified wavelength using a plate reader.
5.4 Result Calculation a) Generate a standard curve using the
absorbance values of standards. b) Calculate the frataxin
concentration in each sample using the standard curve. c) Document
all results with sample identifiers.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results should be reviewed and validated by a technologist.
• Results are entered into the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
and crosschecked for accuracy.
• Critical results should be flagged and communicated to the
clinician according to site-specific guidelines.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolysis, lipemia, and other sample interferences may affect
results.
• Refer to the ELISA kit insert for detailed information on
interferents and limitations.
