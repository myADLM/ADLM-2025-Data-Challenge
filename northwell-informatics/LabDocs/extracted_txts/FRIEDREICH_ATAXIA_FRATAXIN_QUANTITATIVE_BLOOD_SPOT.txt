Protocol for Friedreich Ataxia, Frataxin, Quantitative, Blood Spot
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the quantitative analysis of
frataxin levels in blood spot samples. This protocol ensures accurate
and reliable results in the detection and monitoring of Friedreich
Ataxia.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing and
documenting the quantitative analysis of frataxin as specified in this
protocol. The laboratory supervisor is responsible for ensuring all
staff adhere to these procedures and for addressing any deviations or
issues encountered during the analysis.
1. DEFINITION
Frataxin: A protein involved in iron-sulfur cluster biogenesis in the
mitochondria; its deficiency is associated with Friedreich Ataxia.
1. MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT
Equipment:
• Centrifuge
• Plate reader capable of measuring absorbance at 450 nm
• Incubator set to 37°C
• Analytical balance
• Microplate washer
• Pipettes (single and multi-channel)
• Vortex mixer
Reagents:
• Frataxin standard (calibration curve)
• Blood spot extraction buffer
• Washing buffer
• Blocking buffer
• Anti-frataxin antibody
• Secondary antibody conjugated to HRP
• TMB substrate
• Stop solution (1N H2SO4)
1. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation:
1. Collect blood spot samples on approved collection cards.
2. Allow blood spots to air dry completely at room temperature.
3. Punch out a 3-mm diameter disc from the center of each blood
spot.
B. Extraction of Frataxin:
1. Place each punched disc into a separate well of a 96-well plate.
2. Add 200 µL of blood spot extraction buffer to each well.
3. Incubate the plate at 37°C for 1 hour, shaking gently.
4. Centrifuge the plate at 1,500g for 15 minutes.
5. Transfer the supernatant to a new 96-well plate.
C. Assay Procedure:
1. Prepare standard solutions of frataxin to generate a calibration
curve.
2. Add 100 µL of each standard and extracted sample to a
corresponding well in an ELISA plate pre-coated with anti-
frataxin antibody.
3. Incubate the plate at room temperature for 1 hour.
4. Wash the plate 3 times with washing buffer.
5. Add 100 µL of the secondary antibody (HRP-conjugated) to
each well.
6. Incubate the plate at room temperature for 30 minutes.
7. Wash the plate 3 times with washing buffer.
8. Add 100 µL of TMB substrate to each well and incubate in the
dark for 10-15 minutes.
9. Add 50 µL of stop solution to each well to terminate the
reaction.
10. Read the absorbance at 450 nm using a plate reader.
D. Calculation of Results:
1. Generate a standard curve by plotting the absorbance values
for the frataxin standards.
2. Calculate the frataxin concentration in each sample by
comparing the absorbance values to the standard curve.
3. Report the frataxin concentration in ng/mL or as specified by
laboratory reporting guidelines.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
A. Internal Quality Control:
1. Run quality control samples every time a batch of samples is
tested. Include at least one high and one low-control sample.
2. Compare quality control results against acceptance criteria. If
control values fall outside the acceptable range, investigate and
resolve the issue before processing patient samples.
3. REPORTING RESULTS
4. Review calculated frataxin concentrations to ensure all results
fall within the measurable range.
5. Document results in the laboratory information system (LIS).
6. Results must be approved and signed off by a qualified
laboratory technologist or supervisor before releasing to the
clinician.
7. METHOD LIMITATIONS
8. Ensure that blood spot samples are properly collected, dried,
and stored. Inadequate sample handling can compromise the
integrity of results.
9. Strict adherence to incubation times and temperatures is crucial
for accurate results.
10. Interfering substances present in the blood spot may affect
assay accuracy.
