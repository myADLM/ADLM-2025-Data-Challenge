PROTOCOL FOR THE ANALYTICAL PHASE OF GENERATING
RESULTS FOR FRIEDREICH ATAXIA, REPEAT EXPANSION
ANALYSIS
1. PURPOSE: The purpose of this protocol is to provide a
standardized procedure for the analysis of repeat expansions in the
FXN gene associated with Friedreich Ataxia (FRDA). Consistent and
accurate testing is essential for the diagnosis and subsequent
management of patients suspected to have Friedreich Ataxia.
2. RESPONSIBILITY: Designated laboratory personnel trained in
molecular genetic techniques are responsible for performing the
analysis, documentation, and reporting according to this protocol. It is
also their responsibility to identify and report any deviations or issues
encountered during the analysis.
3. DEFINITIONS:
• FXN Gene: The gene associated with Friedreich Ataxia,
characterized by GAA trinucleotide repeat expansions in the first
intron.
• Normal Range: 5-33 repeats
• Borderline Range: 34-65 repeats
• Expanded Range: 66-1700+ repeats
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES:
• Thermocycler
• Gel Electrophoresis Apparatus
• Capillary Electrophoresis System
• PCR Reagents (Taq polymerase, dNTPs, primers specific to the
FXN gene repeat region)
• Molecular-Grade Water
• DNA extraction kit
• Specific buffers and reagents as per manufacturer's
recommendations
5. PROCEDURE:
A. DNA EXTRACTION:
1. Extract genomic DNA from the patient’s sample (blood or
buccal swab) using the appropriate DNA extraction kit.
2. Quantify the DNA and ensure a minimum concentration of 50
ng/µL and an A260/280 ratio between 1.8 and 2.0.
B. PCR AMPLIFICATION:
1. Prepare the PCR reaction mix according to the following:
◦ 1X PCR buffer with MgCl2
◦ 200 µM each dNTP
◦ 0.2 µM each forward and reverse primer specific for the
GAA repeat region in the FXN gene
◦ 1 unit of Taq DNA polymerase
◦ 100 ng of genomic DNA template
2. Amplify using the following thermocycler conditions:
◦ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 5 minutes
◦ 35 cycles of:
▪ Denaturation: 95°C for 30 seconds
▪ Annealing: 60°C for 30 seconds
▪ Extension: 72°C for 2 minutes
◦ Final extension: 72°C for 7 minutes
C. AGAROSE GEL ELECTROPHORESIS:
1. Prepare a 1.5% agarose gel with appropriate DNA stain.
2. Load 10 µL of PCR product mixed with loading dye into each
well.
3. Run gel at 100V for 45 minutes.
4. Visualize the PCR products under UV light to confirm
amplification.
D. CAPILLARY ELECTROPHORESIS:
1. Prepare the PCR products for capillary electrophoresis as per
the instrument guidelines.
2. Load the prepared samples into the capillary electrophoresis
system.
3. Run the samples using the recommended settings for fragment
analysis.
4. Analyze the electropherogram to determine the number of GAA
repeats in the FXN gene.
E. DATA INTERPRETATION AND REPORTING RESULTS:
1. Compare the observed fragment sizes to the standard curves
or databases that correlate fragment size with the repeat
number.
2. Determine the repeat number for each allele:
◦ Normal Allele: 5-33 repeats
◦ Borderline Allele: 34-65 repeats
◦ Expanded Allele: 66-1700+ repeats
3. Generate a report detailing the results, interpretations, and any
relevant clinical implications.
4. Document any observations, anomalies, or deviations
encountered in the process and take corrective actions as
necessary.
6. QUALITY CONTROL:
1. Include positive and negative controls in each batch of PCR
reactions to ensure the reliability of the results.
2. Perform periodic proficiency testing using known standards.
3. Document and review all results, deviations, and corrective
actions.
7. MAINTENANCE AND CALIBRATION OF EQUIPMENT:
1. Follow the routine maintenance schedule for all equipment
used.
2. Ensure regular calibration of the capillary electrophoresis
system according to the manufacturer's specifications.
8. REFERENCES: Refer to relevant literature, manufacturer’s
instructions for reagents and equipment, and internal laboratory
guidelines for best practices and troubleshooting information.
9. DOCUMENTATION: All analytical data, including raw
electropherograms, PCR gel images, and result interpretations, must
be documented and stored according to the lab’s data management
policy.
This protocol ensures the accurate and reliable determination of the
GAA repeat expansion in the FXN gene, aiding in the diagnosis of
Friedreich Ataxia.
