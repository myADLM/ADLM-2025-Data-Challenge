PROTOCOL FOR ANALYTICAL PHASE OF GENERATING
RESULTS FOR FRUCTOSAMINE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE This SOP provides a detailed procedure for the
accurate measurement of serum fructosamine using an
automated analyzer or specific kit. The protocol ensures that all
specimens are analyzed consistently and effectively, resulting in
reliable and reproducible results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY It is the responsibility of the laboratory
technologists and designated staff to perform and document the
fructosamine serum test according to this SOP. The laboratory
supervisor must ensure compliance and address any issues
related to equipment malfunction, reagent expiration, and
quality control.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Preferred Specimen:
• Serum: Ideally collected in a plain red-top tube.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens that are hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric.
• Plasma or other anticoagulated samples.
• Specimens that have not been stored at the correct temperature.
Stability:
• Room Temperature: Stable for 8 hours.
• Refrigerated (2-8°C): Stable for up to 72 hours.
• Frozen (-20°C or lower): Stable for up to 3 months. Avoid
repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Automated analyzer capable of performing fructosamine assays
(e.g., Roche, Cobas).
• Fructosamine reagent kit, certified for clinical use.
• Calibrators and controls specific to the fructosamine assay.
• Precision pipettes and disposable tips.
• Serum separator tubes (SST) or plain red-top tubes for sample
collection.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Calibration and Quality Control:
1. Ensure the analyzer is calibrated using manufacturer-provided
calibrators. Follow the equipment's specific SOP for calibration.
2. Perform quality control (QC) using both low and high control
materials before running patient samples. Document all QC
results. The QC must fall within specified limits before
proceeding with patient testing.
B. Sample Preparation:
1. Centrifuge the blood collection tube at 3,000 rpm for 10 minutes
to separate the serum.
2. Carefully transfer the serum to a clean, appropriately labeled
sample tube.
3. Ensure that samples are free from hemolysis, lipemia, or icterus
before analysis.
C. Running the Test:
1. Load the serum samples, calibrators, and QC materials onto
the automated analyzer according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
2. Select the appropriate method for serum fructosamine on the
instrument's user interface.
3. Program the analyzer to include the necessary calibrations and
controls.
4. Start the run. The analyzer will automatically process the
samples and generate results.
D. Result Handling:
1. Results will be automatically transmitted to the Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
2. Verify results against pre-determined reference intervals:
◦ Normal Range: 205-285 µmol/L
E. Troubleshooting:
1. If QC fails, do not proceed with patient sample testing.
Recalibrate the analyzer, check reagents, and repeat QC.
2. If issues persist, consult the supervisor or analyzer
manufacturer as needed.
3. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results are automatically transmitted and must be reviewed and
verified by the technologist.
• Any critical or unexpected results must be verified and, if
necessary, repeat analysis should be performed.
• Follow the laboratory’s guidelines for critical result reporting and
documentation.
1. QUALITY CONTROL AND MAINTENANCE
• Perform daily, weekly, and monthly maintenance of the analyzer
according to the manufacturer's guidelines.
• Document all maintenance activities for traceability and
compliance purposes.
• Participate in external proficiency testing as per laboratory
schedule.
1. LIMITATIONS
• Samples with obvious hemolysis or other interferences may
produce inaccurate results. Hemolyzed samples must be rejected
and a new sample should be requested.
• Ensure the analyzer and reagents are within their designated
operational parameters to maintain accuracy and precision.
