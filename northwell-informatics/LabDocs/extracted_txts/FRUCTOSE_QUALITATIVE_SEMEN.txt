Standard Operating Procedure for Fructose, Qualitative, Semen
1. PURPOSE
This protocol outlines the analytical procedure for the qualitative
detection of fructose in semen samples. It is intended to ensure
accurate and reliable testing for clinical diagnostics of male fertility.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory personnel to
perform the test according to this SOP and to ensure that all results
are accurately recorded and reported. The laboratory supervisor is
responsible for overseeing the process, addressing any issues, and
ensuring compliance with quality control procedures.
3. DEFINITION
Qualitative detection of fructose in semen evaluates the presence of
fructose, a sugar significant for the vitality of sperm, used as an
indicator of seminal vesicle function and ejaculatory duct patency.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Acceptable Specimens:
• Fresh seminal fluid.
• Stored semen sample at 2-8°C for up to 24 hours if immediate
testing is not possible.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Semen samples that are clotted.
• Samples that have not been properly stored or are older than 24
hours.
• Contaminated samples that could affect the testing outcome.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• Test tubes
• Pipettes
• Centrifuge (if necessary)
• Water bath or incubator
• Fructose Reagent Kit (specific reagent and detailed instructions
as per manufacturer's insert)
• Timer
6. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Ensure all equipment is clean and functioning properly.
Calibrate instruments according to the manufacturer’s
instructions and laboratory SOPs.
2. Verify that the Fructose Reagent Kit is within its expiration date.
Check for proper storage conditions as per the manufacturer's
instructions.
Testing:
1. Mix the Semen Sample:
◦ If the sample is fresh and has been liquefied, proceed to the
next step.
◦ If not liquefied, incubate specimen at 37°C until liquefaction
is complete.
2. Aliquot the Sample:
◦ Use a clean pipette to transfer 1 mL of semen into a test
tube.
3. Add Fructose Reagent:
◦ Add the appropriate volume of Fructose Reagent to the test
tube containing the semen sample (follow manufacturer’s
protocol for specific reagent to sample ratio).
4. Incubation:
◦ Mix gently but thoroughly.
◦ Incubate the test tube at 37°C for 30 minutes, or as
specified by the manufacturer’s instructions.
5. Observation:
◦ Observe the color change.
◦ Compare the results against a standard color chart provided
in the Fructose Reagent Kit or the reference provided by the
reagent’s manufacturer.
Interpretation:
• A positive reaction indicating the presence of fructose will result in
a color change.
• No color change indicates a negative result for fructose.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Include a positive control (known fructose-containing semen
sample) and a negative control (semen sample known to be
fructose-free) with each batch of tests.
2. Document the results of quality control samples alongside the
test results to ensure the accuracy of the procedure.
3. If control results do not align with expected outcomes,
discontinue testing, and investigate potential causes. Do not
report patient results until the issue is resolved and controls
yield appropriate results.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
Reference Range:
• Positive: Presence of fructose detected.
• Negative: No fructose detected.
Procedure for reporting:
1. Enter the results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
2. Verify and review the results before final reporting.
3. If any anomalies or unexpected results arise, refer to the
supervisor promptly for further evaluation.
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Extreme sample viscosity may hinder proper mixing of the
reagent.
• Hemolysis or high cellular content may interfere with the
colorimetric detection.
• Storage beyond 24 hours or improper storage conditions may
degrade semen quality affecting test results.

11. RECORDKEEPING
All records including the temperature logs, quality control results, and
patient test results should be meticulously maintained and stored as
per laboratory policy.
End of SOP
This protocol ensures accuracy, reliability, and consistency in the
qualitative detection of fructose in semen samples. All staff are
expected to adhere strictly to this SOP and contribute to the
maintenance of high standards in clinical diagnostics.
