Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
FRUIT PANEL IGG
1. PURPOSE
This procedure outlines the steps to generate and analyze results for
FRUIT PANEL IgG testing in the laboratory. The goal is to ensure
accuracy, consistency, and reliability of the test results to assist in the
diagnosis of food allergies.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the
FRUIT PANEL IgG analysis.
• The laboratory supervisor is responsible for ensuring all
procedures are followed and that any issues are documented and
resolved.
1. DEFINITION
FRUIT PANEL IgG testing detects the IgG antibodies to various fruit
allergens in the serum.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Equipment and Supplies:
• Calibrated microplate reader
• ELISA workstation or manual pipettes
• Disposable pipette tips
• Plate washer (automated or manual)
• FRUIT PANEL IgG ELISA kit
• Timer
B. Preparation:
1. Reagents & Kit Components:
◦ Ensure all necessary reagents and components provided in
the FRUIT PANEL IgG ELISA kit are available and within
expiry dates.
◦ Allow all reagents and samples to come to room
temperature (20-25°C) before use.
2. Calibrators and Controls:
◦ Prepare calibrators and controls as per the manufacturer's
instructions.
◦ Verify that positive and negative controls are within the
expected ranges before proceeding.
C. Sample Handling:
1. Specimen Requirements:
◦ Collect blood samples in a serum separator tube (SST).
◦ Allow specimen to clot for at least 30 minutes and then
centrifuge to obtain serum.
◦ Aliquot serum into labeled tubes and store at 2-8°C if testing
will be performed within 72 hours. For longer storage, freeze
at -20°C or lower.
2. Unacceptable Specimens:
◦ Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples should be rejected.
◦ Samples with inadequate volume or mislabeled/missing
identification.
D. ELISA Protocol:
1. Plate Preparation:
◦ Assemble the required number of wells/calibrators/samples
on the ELISA plate.
◦ Record the positions of calibrators, controls, and patient
samples.
2. Assay Steps:
◦ Step 1: Add 100 µL of each calibrator, control, and patient
sample to the assigned wells.
◦ Step 2: Incubate the plate for the specified time at the
indicated temperature (typically 60 minutes at 37°C) in a
humidified chamber.
◦ Step 3: Wash the plate 3-5 times with the wash buffer to
remove unbound substances.
◦ Step 4: Add 100 µL of enzyme-labeled antibody to each
well.
◦ Step 5: Incubate the plate for 30 minutes at room
temperature (20-25°C).
◦ Step 6: Wash the plate again as per manufacturer’s
instructions.
◦ Step 7: Add 100 µL of substrate solution to each well and
incubate for 10-15 minutes in the dark.
◦ Step 8: Add 100 µL of stop solution to each well to stop the
reaction.
◦ Step 9: Read the absorbance at the specified wavelength
(typically 450 nm) using a microplate reader within 30
minutes of stopping the reaction.
E. Quality Control:
1. Internal Controls:
◦ Perform QC with each run using the positive and negative
controls provided in the kit.
◦ Ensure QC results are within the established ranges before
reporting patient results.
2. Documentation:
◦ Document all control results and any deviations or corrective
actions taken in the QC log.
F. Calculation and Interpretation:
1. Results Calculation:
◦ Calculate the mean absorbance for each calibrator, control,
and patient sample.
◦ Generate a standard curve from the absorbance of the
calibrators.
◦ Determine the concentration of IgG antibodies in patient
samples by comparing them to the standard curve.
2. Reporting Results:
◦ Record patient results in the laboratory information system
(LIS).
◦ Flag any results outside the reference range for further
review.
3. Reference Ranges:
◦ Use the reference ranges provided by the manufacturer or
validated in the laboratory for interpretation.
G. Method Limitations:
• Verify individual reagent limitations outlined in the kit insert.
• Interpret results in conjunction with clinical findings and other
diagnostic tests as necessary.
1. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS
• Follow standard laboratory biosafety guidelines.
• Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) such as
lab coat, gloves, and eye protection.
• Dispose of all biohazard waste in accordance with institutional
policies and regulatory requirements.
