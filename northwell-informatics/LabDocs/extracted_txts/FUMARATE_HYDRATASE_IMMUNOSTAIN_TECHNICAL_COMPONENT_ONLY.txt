1. PURPOSE
To define the standardized protocol for performing the technical
component of fumarate hydratase immunostain in the laboratory to
ensure consistent and accurate results.
1. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel performing the
analytical phase of the fumarate hydratase immunostain.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory technicians and technologists are responsible
for following this SOP to perform fumarate hydratase
immunostaining. The Supervisor is accountable for ensuring
adherence to this SOP and addressing any issues that arise during
the staining process.
1. SPECIMENS
Acceptable: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks.
Unacceptable:
• Tissues not properly fixed.
• Inadequate tissue volume or integrity.
• Improperly processed blocks.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Microscope slides and coverslips
• Heat-induced epitope retrieval system (e.g., water bath or
microwave)
• Automated immunostainer (if applicable)
• Microtome
• Incubator
Reagents:
• Primary antibody against fumarate hydratase
• Secondary antibody (HRP-conjugated)
• DAB substrate kit
• Counterstain (e.g., hematoxylin)
• Xylene, Ethanol, and other routine histology chemicals
• Mounting medium
Supplies:
• Positive and negative control tissue slides
• Pipettes and tips
• Staining containers
• Timer
• Gloves and lab coat
1. PROCEDURE
6.1 Preparation
1. Confirm receipt of FFPE tissue blocks and verify accession
details.
2. Cut 3-4 micrometer-thick sections from FFPE blocks using a
microtome and mount sections onto microscope slides.
3. Place slides in a 60°C oven for 30 minutes to ensure adherence
of tissue sections to slides.
6.2 Deparaffinization and Rehydration
1. Deparaffinize tissue sections in three changes of xylene for 5
minutes each.
2. Rehydrate sections through graded ethanol series (100%, 95%,
70%) for 2 minutes each, and rinse in distilled water.
3. Immerse slides in distilled water.
6.3 Antigen Retrieval
1. Perform heat-induced epitope retrieval using the appropriate
buffer (e.g., citrate buffer, pH 6.0) in a water bath or microwave.
2. Allow slides to cool at room temperature for 20 minutes, then
rinse with PBS or distilled water.
6.4 Blocking and Primary Antibody Incubation
1. Block endogenous peroxidase activity by incubating slides in
3% hydrogen peroxide for 10 minutes.
2. Wash slides in PBS twice for 5 minutes each.
3. Apply a protein block (e.g., normal serum) for 10 minutes to
reduce non-specific staining.
4. Incubate tissue sections with primary antibody against fumarate
hydratase (dilution according to manufacturer’s instructions) for
1 hour at room temperature or overnight at 4°C.
6.5 Secondary Antibody and Detection
1. Wash slides in PBS twice for 5 minutes each.
2. Incubate tissue sections with HRP-conjugated secondary
antibody for 30 minutes at room temperature.
3. Wash slides in PBS twice for 5 minutes each.
4. Develop staining by incubating slides with DAB substrate
solution until desired intensity is achieved (monitored under a
microscope).
6.6 Counterstaining and Mounting
1. Rinse slides with distilled water.
2. Counterstain with hematoxylin for 2-3 minutes.
3. Wash slides in tap water to remove excess stain.
4. Dehydrate sections quickly through graded ethanol (70%, 95%,
100%) and clear in xylene.
5. Mount coverslips using a permanent mounting medium.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
7. Each staining run must include a known positive control and a
negative control (omit primary antibody).
8. Document all observations, including any aberrant staining
patterns or artifacts.
9. Quality control slides must be reviewed by a qualified
pathologist to confirm staining quality and specificity.
10. REPORTING RESULTS
11. Once staining is complete and quality control has been
confirmed, slides are to be labeled and handed over for
pathologist review.
12. Technicians do not interpret results but ensure the proper
procedural documentation is maintained.
13. MAINTENANCE
14. Regularly maintain and calibrate equipment according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
15. Verify expiration dates and storage conditions for all reagents.
