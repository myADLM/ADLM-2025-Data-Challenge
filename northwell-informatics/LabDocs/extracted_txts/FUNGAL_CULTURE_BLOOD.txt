Standard Operating Procedure for Fungal Culture, Blood
1. PURPOSE
This procedure outlines the steps to be followed for processing blood
samples for fungal culture, ensuring accurate and timely identification
of fungal organisms in blood specimens.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
All laboratory personnel performing fungal culture tests must follow
this protocol. Supervisors are responsible for ensuring adherence to
this procedure.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• BACTEC FX or BacT/ALERT System
• BACTEC or BacT/ALERT Myco/F Lytic Bottles
• Incubator (35-37°C)
• Biological safety cabinet (Class II)
• Centrifuge (if applicable)
• Sterile inoculating loops and needles
• Sabouraud Dextrose Agar with Chloramphenicol (SDA)
• Brain Heart Infusion (BHI) Agar with Blood
• Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA)
• Microscope with slide preparation materials
• Gram and Lactophenol Cotton Blue Stains
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Blood specimens should be collected in BACTEC or BacT/ALERT
Myco/F Lytic bottles.
• Specimens must be labeled with patient identification, date, time
of collection, and initials of the collector.
• Blood volume: 5-10 mL per bottle
• Specimens must be transported to the laboratory at room
temperature immediately after collection.
5. PROCEDURE
A) Specimen Processing
1. Receipt and Verification:
• Verify patient information and collection details.
• Inspect the bottle for appropriate blood volume and absence of
clots or hemolysis.
2. Initial Incubation:
• Place the blood culture bottle in the BACTEC FX or BacT/ALERT
system.
• Follow the manufacturer's guidelines for loading and monitoring
the system.
• Incubate at 35-37°C for up to 30 days or until flagged positive by
the system.
3. Positive Bottle Handling:
• When the system flags a bottle as positive, promptly remove it
from the incubator.
• Clean the bottle’s tops with 70% alcohol.
• Sub-culturing should be done in a biological safety cabinet to
prevent contamination.
B) Subculture and Microscopy
4. Subculture:
• Using a sterile needle and syringe, aspirate 1-2 mL from the
positive bottle.
• Streak the aspirated sample onto Sabouraud Dextrose Agar with
Chloramphenicol (SDA), Brain Heart Infusion (BHI) Agar with
Blood, and Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA).
• Incubate SDA and PDA plates at 30°C and BHI at 35-37°C for up
to 4 weeks.
• Observe plates daily for fungal growth.
5. Microscopic Examination:
• Prepare smears from the positive bottle and subculture plates.
• Stain one smear with Gram stain and another with Lactophenol
Cotton Blue.
• Examine under a microscope for fungal elements such as yeast,
hyphae, or conidia.
C) Identification and Reporting
6. Identification:
• Perform biochemical tests, molecular methods, or send the
isolates to a reference laboratory for confirmation if necessary.
• Identification should include genus and, where possible, species
level.
7. Reporting Results:
• Document preliminary results and provide updates as significant
growth or identification occurs.
• Record final identification results in the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
• Immediate communication of results to the attending physician is
required if a blood fungal infection is confirmed.
8. Quality Control:
• Include appropriate controls (positive and negative) for each
incubation and test batch.
• Ensure all cultures and reagents are checked regularly for
contamination and performance.
6. SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS
• Handle all specimens with standard precautions as potentially
infectious material.
• Use a biological safety cabinet when handling specimens and
performing cultures.
• Dispose of all biohazard materials in compliance with safety
regulations.
