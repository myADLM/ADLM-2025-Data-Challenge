STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP) FOR FUNGAL
CULTURE, DERMAL
1. PURPOSE
This procedure describes the steps to be followed during the
analytical phase for generating results from fungal culture of dermal
specimens. This SOP ensures that accurate and reliable results are
produced.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
• Laboratory Technologist: Responsible for performing the fungal
culture procedures according to this SOP and recording results.
• Laboratory Supervisor: Ensures that all laboratory technologists
are trained and follow this SOP. Reviews and validates the final
results.
• Quality Control Officer: Conducts regular audits to ensure
adherence to this SOP.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
• Types of Specimen: Dermal scrapings, nail clippings, and hair.
• Specimen Collection: Specimens should be collected in a sterile,
dry container.
• Transport and Storage: Specimens should be transported to the
laboratory as soon as possible after collection. If there is a delay,
the specimen can be stored at room temperature for up to 24
hours.
4. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
• Incubators (set at 25°C and 37°C)
• Biological Safety Cabinet (Class II)
• Sabouraud Dextrose Agar (SDA) Plates
• Mycobiotic Agar Plates
• General microbiological supplies (e.g., sterile loops, slides, cover
slips)
• Microscope (with 10x, 40x, and 100x oil immersion objectives)
• Lactophenol cotton blue stain
5. PROCEDURE
A. Initial Setup:
1. Specimen Inoculation:
◦ Label the SDA and Mycobiotic Agar plates with patient
information and date.
◦ Under a biological safety cabinet, use a sterile loop or
scalpel to transfer the specimen onto the surface of the agar
plates.
◦ Streak the specimen in multiple sections to promote discrete
colony formation.
◦ Replace the lids of the plates and seal with laboratory tape.
2. Incubation:
◦ Incubate the SDA plates at 25°C.
◦ Incubate the Mycobiotic Agar plates at 37°C.
◦ Incubate for up to four weeks, examining plates at intervals
of 48 hours, then 72 hours, with subsequent weekly checks.
B. Monitoring and Documentation:
1. Daily Media Inspection:
◦ Inspect the plates for fungal growth and contaminants.
◦ Record observations (e.g., colony morphology, growth rate)
daily in the laboratory log.
2. Colony Identification:
◦ When growth is observed, perform lactophenol cotton blue
staining and examine under a microscope.
◦ Identify the fungus based on colony morphology and
microscopic appearance.
◦ Perform biochemical tests or molecular methods (e.g., PCR)
if necessary.
C. Documentation of Results:
1. Recording Findings:
◦ Record the presence or absence of fungal growth.
◦ Document the preliminary and final identification of fungal
species.
2. Validation and Reporting:
◦ All findings should be verified by a senior technologist or
supervisor.
◦ Enter final identification and results into the Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
◦ Generate and send a finalized report to the referring
clinician.
6. QUALITY CONTROL AND TROUBLESHOOTING
• Quality Control:
◦ Run positive and negative control samples with each batch of
specimens to ensure media and staining reagents are
performing correctly.
◦ Maintain proper incubation temperatures with continuous
monitoring and logging.
• Troubleshooting:
◦ If contamination is observed, re-culture the original specimen if
still available.
◦ For inconsistent or equivocal results, repeat the testing
process.
◦ If fungal identification is unclear, consult with a mycology
expert.
7. SAFETY PRECAUTIONS
• Always use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE)
including gloves, lab coat, and, if necessary, face protection.
• Handle all specimens and cultures under the biological safety
cabinet to reduce the risk of exposure to dermatophytes and other
pathogens.
• Disinfect work surfaces before and after use with appropriate
disinfectant.
