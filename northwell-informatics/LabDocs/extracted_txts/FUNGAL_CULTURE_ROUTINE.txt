Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for
Fungal Culture Analysis
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedures to be followed in
the analytical phase of fungal culture testing to ensure accurate
detection and identification of fungi in clinical specimens.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing fungal
culture analysis as per the defined procedures.
• It is the responsibility of all laboratory staff to identify any
deficiencies in equipment or procedures that may affect test
results and report them to a supervisor immediately.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Types:
• Acceptable clinical specimens include tissue, fluid aspirates,
respiratory samples, blood, and swabs from relevant sites.
• Specimens should be properly labelled with patient information,
collection date and time.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens that are improperly labelled, collected more than 72
hours prior without appropriate preservation, or compromised in
transit.
Specimen Storage:
• Store specimens at 4°C if immediate processing is not possible.
Do not freeze specimens.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• Biological safety cabinet (BSC)
• Incubator set at 25-30°C (room temperature)
• Sabouraud Dextrose Agar (SDA) plates, with and without
antibiotics
• Brain Heart Infusion (BHI) Agar, with and without blood
• Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA)
• Direct microscopy supplies including KOH and Lactophenol
Cotton Blue stain
• Sterile inoculation loops, swabs, and forceps
• Sterile saline for specimen processing
4. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation and Inoculation:
1. Label culture plates clearly with specimen information.
2. Using sterile technique within the BSC, process the specimen:
◦ Tissue/biopsy: Mince or homogenize small samples in
sterile saline.
◦ Fluid aspirates: Centrifuge and use the concentrated
sediment for inoculation.
◦ Swabs: Vortex vigorously in sterile saline to release
organisms.
3. Inoculate the prepared media (SDA, BHI with/without blood,
PDA) using an appropriate sterile tool.
4. Streak for isolation or use fungal culture swabs directly on the
agar surface. Ensure even distribution.
B) Incubation:
1. Place inoculated media into incubators set at 25-30°C.
2. Incubate for a minimum of 1-4 weeks, checking plates at least
twice weekly.
C) Direct Microscopic Examination:
1. Prepare wet mounts or KOH preparations and examine using a
microscope for the presence of fungal elements (hyphae,
spores).
2. Record observations and correlate with culture results for early
identification.
5. INTERPRETATION AND REPORTING OF RESULTS
Reading Culture Plates:
• Examine plates for fungal colonies at regular intervals.
• Observe colony morphology, color, and growth rate.
• Subculture any suspicious colonies to confirm purity and identity.
Identification of Fungal Isolates:
• Perform conventional methods such as slide culture if needed.
• Use biochemical tests, molecular tests, and/or commercial
identification systems for definitive identification.
Reporting Results:
• Record preliminary positive results and notify the requesting
clinician if significant fungi are isolated.
• Detailed identification and susceptibility testing (if applicable)
should be included in the final report.
• Use laboratory information system (LIS) for documentation,
ensuring that results are reviewed and verified by the technologist
before release.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Maintain up-to-date records of media batch testing and equipment
calibration.
• Include quality control strains with known growth characteristics in
each batch of cultures to ensure media efficacy.
• Document all procedures, observations, and deviations from
protocols.
7. SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS
• All clinical specimens should be treated as potentially infectious.
• Ensure proper use of personal protective equipment (PPE) and
work within a BSC when handling specimens and culturing fungi.
• Dispose of biohazardous waste according to laboratory safety
protocols.

antifungal susceptibility testing.

reagent handling.
This SOP outlines the crucial steps of fungal culture analysis,
detailing the careful handling and processing of specimens through to
reporting results while ensuring quality control and safety are
maintained throughout the process.
