FUNGAL CULTURE, VAGINAL
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this protocol is to outline the process for the analytical
phase of generating results for vaginal fungal cultures. This protocol
ensures the accurate and timely identification of fungal organisms
from vaginal specimens.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND HANDLING
Specimen Collection:
• Obtain a vaginal swab specimen using a sterile swab.
• Ensure the specimen is collected directly from the vaginal canal to
maximize the likelihood of recovering the relevant fungal
organisms.
• Label the specimen container clearly with patient identification
and collection date/time.
Specimen Storage:
• If a delay in processing is expected, store the specimen at 2-8°C
for no longer than 24 hours.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Sabouraud Dextrose Agar (SDA) plates
• Chromogenic agar (CHROMagar Candida)
• Brain Heart Infusion (BHI) broth with antibiotics
• Sterile cotton swabs
• Incubators set to 25-30°C and 37°C
• Microscope with fungal stains (e.g., KOH)
• Inoculating loops or needles
• Standard laboratory safety equipment (gloves, lab coat, etc.)
1. PROCEDURE
A. Inoculation of Media:
1. Label SDA plates, CHROMagar plates, and BHI broth tubes
with patient identification.
2. Use the sterile swab to transfer the specimen onto the center of
the media plates and streak for isolation. Carefully insert the
swab into the BHI broth.
3. Incubate SDA and CHROMagar plates:
◦ At 25-30°C and 37°C for up to 2 weeks, examining daily for
fungal growth.
4. Incubate BHI broth:
◦ At 37°C for 2-7 days, examining daily for turbidity indicating
growth.
B. Examination:
1. Daily, inspect plates and broth for fungal growth:
◦ On SDA, expect creamy to whitish colonies that may vary in
texture.
◦ On CHROMagar, Candida species may produce colonies of
different colors, aiding in initial species identification.
◦ Turbidity in BHI broth indicates potential growth.
2. Perform microscopic examination using KOH preparation or
other fungal stains to confirm the presence of fungal elements.
C. Identification:
1. Subculture any growth from SDA plates and BHI broth onto
fresh media if necessary to obtain pure cultures.
2. Utilize additional tests and media as needed (e.g., cornmeal
agar, germ tube test, API 20C AUX) for further species
identification.
3. Compare observed colony morphology, color changes on
chromogenic medium, and microscopic characteristics to
known fungal species descriptions.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
• Daily check and document temperature of incubators.
• Use positive and negative control strains to ensure media and
reagents are functioning correctly.
• Document all quality control results and any corrective actions
taken.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Report organism identification to the referring physician or
department.
• If no growth is observed after 2 weeks, report as "No fungal
growth."
• Include information regarding the presence of specific fungal
species alongside any pertinent susceptibility results if applicable.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Not applicable for qualitative culture results. Each positive result
should be compared to established laboratory references for fungal
pathogens.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Some slow-growing fungi may require longer incubation times.
• Overgrowth of bacterial contaminants despite the use of selective
media may hinder fungal recovery.

• Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines for
fungal culture.
• Manufacturer instructions for SDA, CHROMagar, and BHI media.
This protocol is intended to standardize fungal culture processing in
the laboratory, ensuring reliability and accuracy in detecting and
identifying vaginal fungal infections. Regular review and updates
should be performed to incorporate any advancements in diagnostic
methodologies.
