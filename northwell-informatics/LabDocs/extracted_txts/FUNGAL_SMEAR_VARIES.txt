Standard Operating Procedure: Analytical Phase of Generating
Results for Fungal Smear
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is to
outline the steps necessary for the accurate and precise generation
of results for fungal smears. This procedure ensures the safety of
laboratory personnel and the reliability of test results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory staff must adhere to this procedure when
processing fungal smear specimens. It is the responsibility of all staff
to properly prepare, stain, and interpret fungal smears and to report
results following laboratory protocols.
3. DEFINITION
A fungal smear involves the preparation, staining, and microscopic
examination of clinical specimens to identify fungal elements. This
procedure includes all steps from smear preparation to the reporting
of results.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Clean glass slides
• Sterile swabs
• Biohazard disposal containers
• Bunsen burner or incinerator
• Staining reagents (e.g., KOH, Calcofluor White, Lactophenol
Cotton Blue, Giemsa stain)
• Immersion oil
• Light microscope with appropriate magnification (40x and 100x
objectives)
• Logbook or laboratory information system for documentation
• Personal protective equipment (PPE) including gloves, lab coat,
and safety goggles
5. PROCEDURE
A) Specimen Handling and Preparation
1. Specimen Validation:
◦ Confirm that the specimen has been received in good
condition and is correctly labeled.
◦ Verify requisition details to ensure the correct type of
analysis is required.
2. Smear Preparation:
◦ Using a sterile swab, collect an appropriate sample from the
clinical specimen.
◦ Transfer the specimen to a clean glass slide by evenly
spreading the sample over the surface.
3. Fixation:
◦ Air-dry the slide completely.
◦ Fix the smear by briefly passing the slide through a flame
2-3 times or using a fixative spray.
B) Staining Procedure
1. Potassium Hydroxide (KOH) Preparation:
◦ Add a drop of 10-20% KOH solution onto the smear.
◦ Gently cover with a coverslip and allow it to sit for 15-30
minutes before examining under the microscope.
2. Calcofluor White Staining (optional):
◦ Apply a drop of Calcofluor White stain and a drop of 10%
KOH to the smear.
◦ Cover with a coverslip, incubate for 1 minute in the dark,
and then observe using a fluorescent microscope.
3. Lactophenol Cotton Blue:
◦ Apply a drop of Lactophenol Cotton Blue directly to the
smear.
◦ Cover with a coverslip and examine the slide under a
microscope immediately.
4. Giemsa Staining:
◦ Cover the smear with Giemsa stain for 10-15 minutes.
◦ Rinse gently with distilled water, air dry, and examine the
slide under the microscope.
C) Microscopic Examination
1. Adjust the microscope to the desired magnification starting with
a lower objective (10x) and then moving to 40x or 100x (oil
immersion) as needed.
2. Carefully scan the entire smear systematically.
3. Look for characteristic fungal elements, such as hyphae,
spores, yeast cells, and pseudohyphae.
D) Documentation and Reporting
1. Recording Results:
◦ Document the findings, including the type and quantity of
fungal elements observed.
◦ Use specific terminologies and classifications to describe
the fungi present.
2. Reporting:
◦ Enter the results into the laboratory information system.
◦ Verify the accuracy of the data before submission.
◦ Notify the treating physician or requesting entity of critical or
unexpected findings.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Include known positive and negative control slides with each
batch of specimens to ensure staining efficacy and microscope
functionality.
2. Record control results in the designated logbook.
3. Troubleshoot any discrepancies in staining or microscopy as
needed and repeat the analysis if necessary.
7. SAFETY AND DISPOSAL
1. Follow standard biosafety guidelines for handling and disposing
of biological specimens.
2. Wear appropriate PPE at all times.
3. Dispose of biohazard waste in accordance with laboratory
protocols.
