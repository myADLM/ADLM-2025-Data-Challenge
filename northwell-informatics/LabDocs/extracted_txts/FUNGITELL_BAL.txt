STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES (SOPs) FOR THE
ANALYTICAL PHASE OF GENERATING RESULTS FOR
FUNGITELL (BAL)
1. PURPOSE:
The purpose of this document is to provide a standardized procedure
for conducting the Fungitell assay using Bronchoalveolar Lavage
(BAL) samples. This assay detects (1→3)-β-D-Glucan, a
polysaccharide cell wall component of most pathogenic fungi, to aid
in the diagnosis of invasive fungal infections.
1. SCOPE:
This SOP applies to all qualified laboratory staff performing the
Fungitell assay using BAL specimens in the clinic.
1. RESPONSIBILITY:
It is the responsibility of the laboratory technologist to ensure the
Fungitell assay is performed accurately and results are recorded and
reported consistently according to this SOP. The supervisor must
ensure that all deviations from this SOP are appropriately
documented and corrective actions are implemented where
necessary.
1. DEFINITIONS:
Fungitell Assay: An assay used to quantify (1→3)-β-D-Glucan in the
BAL fluid. BAL Specimens: Samples obtained from bronchoalveolar
lavage, a medical procedure to collect fluid from the lower respiratory
tract.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES:
• Fungitell Assay Kit • Microplate Reader • Pipettes (single and multi-
channel) • Pipette tips • Calibrated Micropipets • Vortex mixer •
Centrifuge • BAL Specimens • Clean, disposable tubes • Distilled
water • Positive and negative control reagents • Calibration standards
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY:
• BAL specimens should be collected in appropriate sterile
containers. • Specimens should be transported to the laboratory as
soon as possible. • Specimens should be kept at 2-8°C if there is a
delay in analysis and analyzed within 24 hours. • Specimens may be
frozen at -20°C if longer storage required. • Thawed samples should
be well mixed and centrifuged if particulate matter is present before
analysis.
1. QUALITY CONTROL:
• Perform the assay with quality controls (positive and negative) and
standards provided in the Fungitell Assay Kit with every batch. •
Ensure that QC results fall within the manufacturer’s established
ranges before releasing patient results. • Document all QC results
clearly and investigate any outliers before continuing with sample
testing.
1. PROCEDURE:
A. Preparation:
• Enable access to the Fungitell software on the microplate reader. •
Set up the microplate template according to the Fungitell Assay Kit
instructions. • Prepare all reagents, controls, and standards provided
in the Fungitell Assay Kit as per the manufacturer’s instructions.
B. Sample Preparation:
• Thaw BAL specimens if previously frozen and allow them to come
to room temperature. • Mix the specimens thoroughly by vortexing. •
If necessary, centrifuge the specimen at 3000 RPM for 10 minutes to
clarify and remove particulate matter.
C. Assay Execution:
1. Pipette 50 μL of the specimen, controls, and calibrators into
designated wells on the microplate.
2. Add 50 μL of Fungitell reagent to each well.
3. Gently tap the plate to ensure proper mixing of reagents.
4. Incubate the microplate at room temperature for 45 minutes.
5. Read the optical density (OD) at 405 nm on the microplate
reader.
D. Data Analysis:
• Utilize the Fungitell software for calculating the concentration of
(1→3)-β-D-Glucan in samples and controls based on the calibration
curve. • Review the generated results for validity and against QC
values.
1. REPORTING RESULTS:
• Record and report the results in the Laboratory Information System
(LIS). • Provide the concentration of (1→3)-β-D-Glucan in pg/mL with
reference ranges provided by the Fungitell Assay Kit instructions. •
Report any samples that fall outside of standard reference ranges as
per clinical interpretation guidelines provided.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
Refer to the Fungitell Assay Kit insert for any additional limitations
regarding the detection limit, specificity, and potential interferences.
1. REFERENCES:
• Fungitell Assay Kit Product Insert for detailed information on
reagent preparation, quality control ranges, assay procedure, and
interpretation of results.
1. DOCUMENTATION:
• Maintain all logs and records of calibration standards, controls, and
patient results. • Document any deviations, corrective actions, and
troubleshooting steps taken during the process.
1. REVIEW AND VALIDATION:
• This SOP should be reviewed annually or whenever significant
changes to the assay procedure or instrumentation are made. • Any
updates or deviations should be documented, and staff should be re-
trained accordingly.
By ensuring adherence to this protocol, accurate and reliable results
for the Fungitell assay on BAL specimens can be consistently
achieved, aiding clinicians in the diagnosis of invasive fungal
infections.
