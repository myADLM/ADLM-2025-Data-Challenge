Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): FUNGITELL Analysis -
Bronchoalveolar Lavage (BAL)
1. PURPOSE
This procedure outlines the steps for analyzing Bronchoalveolar
Lavage (BAL) specimens using the Fungitell assay to detect the
presence of (1→3)-β-D-glucan, an indicator of fungal infection.
Responsibility: Laboratory Technologists are responsible for
performing, documenting, and troubleshooting the Fungitell assay
according to this SOP. Supervisors are responsible for ensuring
compliance with the protocol and addressing any issues that arise.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/acceptable:
• BAL fluid collected in a sterile container.
• Specimens must be processed promptly, ideally within 4 hours of
collection. If this is not possible, samples can be stored at 4°C for
up to 24 hours before analysis.
Unacceptable:
• Specimens contaminated with blood or other extraneous
substances.
• Specimens stored beyond the acceptable time frame without
appropriate refrigeration.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Fungitell Kit (includes Fungitell reagent, control reagents, and
standard curve reagents)
• Microplate reader compatible with Fungitell assay (preferably 405
nm filter)
• Micropipettes and tips
• Sterile, endotoxin-free tubes
• Vortex mixer
• Incubator (37°C)
• Personal protective equipment (PPE) (gloves, lab coat, safety
goggles)
1. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation of Reagents and Controls:
1. Thaw and mix all reagents as required by the manufacturer’s
instructions.
2. Prepare positive and negative control reagents as per the kit
instructions.
3. Set up the microplate by adding the appropriate standards,
controls, and samples.
B) Sample Preparation:
1. Transfer 50 µL of BAL fluid to a sterile, endotoxin-free tube.
2. Vortex the sample for 15 seconds to ensure homogeneity.
3. Add 100 µL of the sample to the designated wells of the
microplate.
C) Fungitell Assay:
1. Add 100 µL of Fungitell reagent to each well containing sample,
standards, and controls.
2. Mix the plate gently using a vortex mixer to ensure even
distribution.
3. Incubate the plate at 37°C for 40 minutes.
4. Immediately after incubation, read the absorbance of the wells
using a microplate reader set to 405 nm.
D) Data Analysis:
1. Use the software provided with the microplate reader to
generate a standard curve based on the absorbance of the
standards.
2. Calculate the concentration of (1→3)-β-D-glucan in the samples
by comparing the sample absorbance values against the
standard curve.
3. Review all values for any deviations or anomalies that may
indicate procedural errors or sample issues.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
5. Run positive and negative controls with each batch of samples
to verify assay performance.
6. Ensure all equipment is calibrated and maintained according to
manufacturer specifications.
7. Document all quality control results in the appropriate log.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
9. Record the results in the laboratory information system (LIS)
following the established protocols.
10. If results indicate a high level (> 80 pg/mL) of (1→3)-β-D-
glucan, flag for further clinical correlation.
11. Report critical values immediately to the ordering physician
according to the laboratory’s critical value policy and document
the communication process.
12. METHODS LIMITATIONS
• Cross-reactivity can occur with certain medications and conditions
that may lead to false-positive results.
• Ensure stringent aseptic techniques to avoid contamination and
false results.

By following this SOP, consistent and accurate Fungitell analysis of
BAL specimens will be achieved, contributing to the effective
identification and management of fungal infections in patients.
