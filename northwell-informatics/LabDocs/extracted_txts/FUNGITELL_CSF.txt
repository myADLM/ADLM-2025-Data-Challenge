Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Analytical Phase: Generating
Results for FUNGITELL, CSF
1. PURPOSE
This procedure outlines the step-by-step method for generating
results using the FUNGITELL assay for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
samples. The goal is to ensure accuracy, consistency, and reliability
in the measurement of (1→3)-β-D-Glucan (a biomarker of fungal
infection) in CSF samples.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory staff performing FUNGITELL assays
should follow this procedure meticulously.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring staff adherence to the
protocol and addressing any issues or deficiencies in the process.
1. SPECIMEN HANDLING
Preferred/Acceptable:
• CSF samples should be collected aseptically and transported to
the laboratory under refrigeration (2-8°C).
• Samples should be processed within 48 hours of collection to
minimize degradation.
• Specimens should be devoid of cells, and if necessary, should be
centrifuged to remove particulate matter prior to testing.
Unacceptable:
• Samples that are contaminated, hemolyzed, or older than 48
hours.
• Specimens without proper identification or collection details.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• FUNGITELL Assay Kit (including reagents, standards, and
controls)
• Microplate reader capable of measuring absorbance at 405 nm
• Pipettes and tips
• Sterile centrifuge tubes (if cell-free preparation is needed)
• Vortex mixer
• Necessary PPE (personal protective equipment)
1. PROCEDURE
Sample Preparation:
• Ensure all specimens are at room temperature prior to analysis.
• If cells are present, centrifuge the specimen at 1500 rpm for 10
minutes. Transfer the supernatant to a clean container.
Assay Preparation:
1. Arrange all necessary reagents and samples in the testing
area.
2. Prepare standards and controls as detailed in the FUNGITELL
package insert.
3. Set up reaction plates according to the kit instructions, including
wells for standards, controls, and test samples.
Running the Assay:
1. Add reagents to the wells containing standards, controls, and
samples, adhering strictly to the volume and sequence
specified by the manufacturer.
2. Initiate the enzymatic reaction by adding the glucan reagent.
3. Incubate the plates at 37°C for 90 minutes.
Reading the Results:
1. Measure the absorbance at 405 nm using a microplate reader.
2. Record the absorbance readings for all wells.
Data Analysis and Interpretation:
1. Use the standard curve generated from the known
concentrations to interpolate the (1→3)-β-D-Glucan levels in
the CSF samples.
2. Ensure that the controls fall within the expected range. If
controls are out of range, investigate potential causes (e.g.,
reagent issues, equipment malfunction).
Quality Control:
• Run kit controls with each assay batch. Record and evaluate
control data to confirm acceptable performance.
• Review historical data to ensure trending and consistency.
Actions for Out-of-Control Results:
• If the assay controls fall out of the expected range, repeat the
assay.
• Investigate potential reasons for anomalies, such as equipment
calibration, reagent integrity, and sample handling errors.
• Notify the supervisor and document corrective actions taken.
Reporting Results:
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
promptly.
• Ensure results are reviewed and verified by the technologist
before release.
Critical Results:
• Report critical results immediately to the attending physician or
healthcare provider.
• Record the reporting details following the lab's protocol for critical
values.

1. RECORDKEEPING
• Maintain all logs and documentation of temperatures, assays
performed, quality control data, and corrective actions taken.
• Store records for the retention period defined by the laboratory's
policies.
1. SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS
• Follow all laboratory safety protocols, including the use of PPE.
• Dispose of biohazard materials according to the lab's biohazard
waste disposal procedures.
By following the above SOP, laboratory staff will ensure that the
FUNGITELL assay results for CSF samples are accurate, reliable,
and delivered in a timely manner to support patient care.
