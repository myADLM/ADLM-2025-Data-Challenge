FUROSEMIDE (LASIX) Analysis Protocol
1. PURPOSE
To establish a standardized procedure for the quantitative
determination of Furosemide (Lasix) in patient specimens. This
protocol ensures accurate and reliable results by following consistent
and validated analytical methods.
2. SCOPE
This protocol applies to all laboratory personnel engaged in the
analysis of Furosemide in patient specimens within the clinical
laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Designated laboratory staff is responsible for performing
Furosemide analysis according to this procedure.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring compliance with this
protocol and addressing any issues that may arise.
• All staff members are responsible for acknowledging and
reporting any deviations or equipment malfunctions that could
impact test results.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) system with
UV detector
• Analytical column (C18 is recommended)
• Furosemide standard
• Mobile phase (e.g., methanol:water (70:30) with 0.1% formic acid)
• Sample vials and caps
• Pipettes and tips
• Centrifuge
• Calibrated balance
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
• Logbook for recording results
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred specimen: Plasma or serum
• Collection tube: Lithium heparin for plasma or SST for serum
• Volume: Minimum 1 mL
• Handling: Samples should be centrifuged and separated within 2
hours of collection and stored at 2-8°C if not immediately
analyzed.
• Unacceptable specimens: Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples;
samples collected in inappropriate tubes
6. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation
1. Ensure all reagents and equipment are prepared and
operational according to manufacturer's instructions.
2. Centrifuge blood samples at 1500 x g for 10 minutes to
separate plasma or serum.
3. Transfer the supernatant to a clean sample vial.
B. Calibration and Controls
1. Prepare a series of Furosemide standards ranging from 0.1 to
200 µg/mL.
2. Run a calibration curve at the beginning of each analysis day to
ensure instrument accuracy.
3. Use quality control samples with known concentrations of
Furosemide to monitor analytical performance. Include at least
one low, one medium, and one high control in each sequence
of patient samples.
C. HPLC Analysis
1. Set up the HPLC system with the following conditions:
◦ Analytical column: C18
◦ Mobile phase: Methanol:water (70:30) with 0.1% formic acid
◦ Flow rate: 1.0 mL/min
◦ Injection volume: 20 µL
◦ Detection wavelength: 238 nm
2. Inject calibration standards followed by quality control samples
and patient specimens.
3. Ensure the system is equilibrated by running at least three
blank injections between calibration and sample runs.
D. Data Analysis
1. Analyze chromatograms using the HPLC software.
2. Compare peak areas of the patient specimens against the
calibration curve.
3. Calculate the concentration of Furosemide in each specimen
using the equation generated from the calibration curve.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Transcribe the results from the HPLC system to the laboratory
information system (LIS).
2. Verify all results against quality control criteria before reporting.
3. Review critical results and follow the laboratory’s policy on
reporting and documentation.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Run quality control samples at the beginning and end of each
batch, and after every ten patient samples.
2. Ensure all controls are within acceptable ranges.
3. Document any deviations and corrective actions taken in the
logbook.
9. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Therapeutic range: 0.2-2.0 µg/mL
10. METHODS LIMITATIONS
1. Ensure no significant interference from co-administered drugs.
2. Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples may affect results and
should be avoided.
