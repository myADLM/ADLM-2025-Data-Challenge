Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analyzing Fusarium
Moniliforme, IgE, Serum
1. Purpose: To outline the procedures for the analysis of Fusarium
Moniliforme specific Immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels in serum
specimens to ensure accurate, reliable, and timely reporting of
results.
2. Responsibility: The designated technical staff at the laboratory
will be responsible for performing the analysis and documenting the
procedures and results accurately following this SOP. It is the
responsibility of all laboratory staff to identify any deficiencies in the
procedure that may affect the test results and report them to their
supervisor promptly.
3. Equipment, Reagents, and Materials:
• Equipment:
◦ Immunoassay analyzer (e.g., ImmunoCAP or equivalent)
◦ Calibrated micropipettes
◦ Centrifuge
◦ Incubator (if applicable)
◦ Refrigerator (2-8°C) for reagent storage
• Reagents:
◦ ImmunoCAP Fusarium Moniliforme IgE reagent (or equivalent)
◦ Calibrators (Traceable to WHO IgE International Reference
Prep 75/502 or applicable)
◦ Controls (Positive and Negative)
◦ Wash buffer
◦ Substrate solution
◦ Stop solution
◦ Diluent (if required by the analyzer)
• Supplies:
◦ Serum collection tubes (red or gold top)
◦ Disposable pipette tips
◦ Microcentrifuge tubes
◦ Gloves, lab coats, and other personal protective equipment
(PPE)
◦ Sample tubes
4. Specimen:
• Preferred:
◦ 2-5 mL serum from a clotted blood sample (red or gold top
tube)
• Acceptance Criteria:
◦ Serum without hemolysis, lipemia, or excessive bilirubin
◦ Specimen should be transported to the lab within 24 hours at
2-8°C. If transportation is extended beyond 24 hours, it should
be frozen at -20°C or lower.
◦ Appropriately labeled with patient identification and collection
date/time
• Unacceptable:
◦ Hemolytic, lipemic, or icteric specimens
◦ Specimens left at room temperature for more than 2 hours
5. Procedure:
A. Specimen Preparation:
• Allow the blood specimen to clot at room temperature for 30
minutes to 1 hour.
• Centrifuge the clotted blood sample at 1500-2000 x g for 10
minutes.
• Carefully transfer the serum to a clean, labeled sample tube.
• Check specimen for hemolysis, lipemia, or icterus and ensure it
meets acceptability criteria.
B. Analysis on the Immunoassay Analyzer:
• Turn on the immunoassay analyzer and allow it to perform its
startup checks and calibrate if necessary.
• Load reagents, calibrators, and controls following the
manufacturer's instructions.
• Run the calibrators and ensure the calibration curve meets
acceptable criteria.
• Run control samples (positive and negative) to verify
performance. Acceptable ranges must be met before proceeding
with the patient samples.
• Pipette patient serum samples into microcentrifuge tubes if
dilution is required. Dilute if necessitated by high or low IgE
concentration.
C. Testing Procedure:
• Follow the immunoassay analyzer's specific instructions for
loading and running the patient samples.
• Ensure all samples are labeled correctly and entered in the
analyzer software to maintain traceability.
• Document the run number, date, time, and operator initials in the
assay log.
D. Result Interpretation:
• After analysis, review results provided by the analyzer.
• Compare the results against established reference ranges for
Fusarium Moniliforme-specific IgE levels.
• Re-run any questionable results and verify specimen integrity if
abnormalities are observed.
6. Quality Control:
• Run Quality controls (QC) with each batch of samples.
• Acceptable range for controls must be within predefined limits;
document performance.
• Review QC results as part of the daily quality assurance
processes.
• Ensure all equipment maintenance and calibration records are up
to date.
7. Reporting Results:
• Enter the results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Review and validate results ensuring they meet clinical
expectations.
• For any critical or unexpected results, follow the laboratory's
protocol for notifying the healthcare provider.
8. Reference Intervals:
• The reference interval for Fusarium Moniliforme, IgE, Serum
should be indicated based on the kit insert and verified with
laboratory data.
• Typical ranges:
◦ Negative: <0.35 kU/L
◦ Borderline: 0.35-0.70 kU/L
◦ Positive: >0.70 kU/L
9. Documentation and Records:
• Maintain all records of calibration, sample runs, QC results, and
maintenance logs for regulatory and accreditation requirements.
• Any deviations from SOP or unexpected occurrences should be
documented and reported.
10. Method Limitations:
• Ensure to review the manufacturer's insert for any specific
interferences or limitations related to the assay.
• Understand potential cross-reactivities with other fungi or
allergens and document any observed anomalies.

By following this SOP, the laboratory can consistently generate
accurate and reliable Fusarium Moniliforme, IgE, Serum results that
meet regulatory standards and ensure patient safety and care.
