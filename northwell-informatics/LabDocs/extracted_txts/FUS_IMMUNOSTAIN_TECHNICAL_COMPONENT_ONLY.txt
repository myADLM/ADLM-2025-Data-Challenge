PROTOCOL FOR FUS IMMUNOSTAIN, TECHNICAL COMPONENT
ONLY
1. PURPOSE
This procedure outlines the methodology for the technical
component of FUS Immunostaining utilized in the detection and
localization of the Fused in Sarcoma (FUS) protein in tissue
specimens. The FUS protein is implicated in various diseases,
such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and its detection is
vital for accurate diagnosis.
2. SCOPE
This protocol applies to all laboratory personnel who are trained
and qualified to perform immunohistochemical (IHC) staining on
formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue sections.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the designated trained technologists to
perform and document FUS immunostaining according to this
procedure. Any deviations or problems encountered during
staining must be documented and reported to the supervisor
promptly.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
◦ Type: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections.
◦ Section Thickness: 4 µm sections mounted on positively
charged slides.
◦ Storage: Slides should be stored at room temperature until
staining is performed.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
◦ Equipment:
▪ Microtome
▪ Water Bath (45-50°C)
▪ Incubator (37°C)
▪ Staining Chambers
▪ Microscope
◦ Reagents:
▪ Xylene
▪ Ethanol (100%, 95%, and 70%)
▪ Distilled water
▪ Enzyme retrieval buffer, citrate buffer (pH 6.0) or EDTA
buffer (pH 9.0)
▪ Peroxidase blocking solution
▪ Dilution buffer
▪ FUS primary antibody (Validated clone and
concentration)
▪ Secondary antibody (HRP-conjugated)
▪ DAB (3,3-diaminobenzidine) substrate
▪ Hematoxylin
▪ Mounting medium
◦ Supplies:
▪ Glass slides
▪ Coverslips
▪ Pipettes and tips
▪ Timer
6. PROCEDURE
A. Pre-Staining Preparations:
◦ Ensure all reagents are prepared and brought to room
temperature.
◦ Verify that all necessary controls (positive and negative) are
included in the run.
B. Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
◦ Bake slides at 65°C for 1 hour to melt paraffin.
◦ Deparaffinize slides in xylene: 3 changes, 5 minutes each.
◦ Rehydrate through graded ethanols: 100%, 95%, and 70%
for 3 minutes each.
◦ Rinse in distilled water for 2 minutes.
C. Antigen Retrieval:
◦ Place slides in citrate buffer (pH 6.0) and heat in a
microwave or water bath at 95-99°C for 20 minutes.
Alternatively, use EDTA buffer (pH 9.0) if specified.
◦ Allow slides to cool for 20 minutes at room temperature.
◦ Rinse in distilled water.
D. Blocking Endogenous Peroxidase Activity:
◦ Incubate slides in peroxidase blocking solution for 10
minutes at room temperature.
◦ Rinse slides in distilled water followed by buffer (PBS or
TBS).
E. Primary Antibody Incubation:
◦ Dilute the primary FUS antibody according to
manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Apply primary antibody to the tissue sections and incubate
in a humidified chamber for 1 hour at room temperature or
overnight at 4°C.
◦ Rinse slides in buffer for 3 times, 5 minutes each.
F. Secondary Antibody Incubation:
◦ Apply HRP-conjugated secondary antibody and incubate for
30 minutes at room temperature.
◦ Rinse slides in buffer for 3 times, 5 minutes each.
G. Chromogen Development:
◦ Apply DAB solution to each slide and incubate for 5
minutes, monitoring color development under the
microscope.
◦ Rinse slides in distilled water.
H. Counterstaining and Mounting:
◦ Counterstain sections with hematoxylin for 2 minutes.
◦ Rinse slides in tap water and bluing solution if required.
◦ Dehydrate through graded ethanols, clear in xylene, and
coverslip using mounting medium.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Include a known positive control and a negative control
(primary antibody omitted) with each batch of slides stained.
◦ Monitor staining intensity and specificity in control sections.
◦ Document all staining results in the laboratory’s staining
logbook.
8. INTERPRETATION AND REPORTING RESULTS
◦ Examine stained slides under a microscope to ensure
appropriate staining.
◦ Positive staining for FUS protein will indicate a brown
coloration at the site of the antigen.
◦ Ensure pathologist review and sign-off on final
interpretation.
◦ Record results in the laboratory information system (LIS)
and report according to the laboratory’s guidelines.
9. TROUBLESHOOTING
◦ If no staining is observed in the positive control, check for
errors in reagent preparation and procedure steps.
◦ If high background staining occurs, review blocking steps
and reagent concentrations.
