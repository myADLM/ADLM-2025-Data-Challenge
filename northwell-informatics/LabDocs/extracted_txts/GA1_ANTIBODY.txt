Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) GA1 Antibody Analysis
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this SOP is to outline the
procedures for the analysis of GA1 antibody in patient serum
samples. This protocol ensures accurate and consistent results
in GA1 Antibody testing.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
• Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for conducting
the analysis according to this SOP.
• Laboratory supervisors are responsible for ensuring that
designated personnel are trained in GA1 antibody analysis and
adhere to this SOP.
• Quality control personnel are responsible for verifying that all
procedures are followed and documentation is complete and
accurate.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred Sample: Serum collected in a red-top tube or SST
(Serum Separator Tube).
• Minimum Volume: 3 mL of serum.
• Specimen Stability:
◦ Room Temperature: 24 hours.
◦ Refrigerated: 72 hours.
◦ Frozen: Stable indefinitely at -20°C or lower.
1. REAGENTS, SUPPLIES, AND EQUIPMENT
• ELISA kit for GA1 Antibody detection (specific manufacturer
instructions to be followed).
• Microplate reader capable of measuring absorbance at 450 nm.
• Pipettes and pipette tips.
• Disposable microplates.
• Wash buffer.
• Substrate solution (TMB or similar).
• Stop solution (typically 1N HCl).
• Calibrated centrifuge.
• Deionized water.
1. PROCEDURE A. Sample Preparation:
2. Allow serum samples to clot for at least 30 minutes.
3. Centrifuge the blood samples at 3000 RPM for 10 minutes.
4. Carefully aliquot the serum into labeled tubes without disturbing
the cell pellet.
5. Store serum samples as required until analysis.
B. ELISA Assay Procedure:
1. Bring all reagents and samples to room temperature before
starting the assay.
2. Prepare the required number of wells in the microplate for
standards, controls, and samples.
3. Pipette 100 μL of assay buffer into each well designated for the
standard curve.
4. Add 50 μL of standards, positive control, and negative control to
the appropriate wells.
5. Add 50 μL of each serum sample to the test wells.
6. Add 50 μL of GA1 antibody reaction mix into each well. Mix well
by gently tapping the plate.
7. Incubate the microplate at 37°C for 1 hour.
8. Wash the microplate 4 times with the provided wash buffer.
9. Add 100 μL of HRP-conjugated secondary antibody into each
well. Incubate at room temperature for 30 minutes.
10. Wash the microplate 5 times with the wash buffer.
11. Add 100 μL of substrate solution to each well. Incubate in the
dark at room temperature for 15 minutes.
12. Add 50 μL of stop solution to each well. Gently tap the plate to
ensure thorough mixing.
C. Reading and Interpretation of Results:
1. Measure the absorbance at 450 nm within 30 minutes of adding
the stop solution using a microplate reader.
2. Generate a standard curve by plotting the absorbance of the
standards against their respective concentrations.
3. Determine the concentration of GA1 antibodies in the serum
samples from the standard curve.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include positive and negative controls with each run to ensure
assay validity.
• Quality control samples should be included in each assay run and
must fall within the established acceptable ranges.
• If control values fall outside acceptable ranges, the run should be
considered invalid, and the assay repeated.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results are reported in units as specified by the assay kit
manufacturer.
• All results must be recorded and reviewed before reporting.
• Report any significant findings or deviations from expected results
to the supervising technologist and follow the appropriate
corrective actions.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Improper handling of samples and reagents can affect assay
accuracy.
• Hemolyzed or lipemic samples may interfere with the assay
results.
• The presence of other antibodies or substances in the serum
could result in false positive or false negative results.

• Manufacturer’s package insert for GA1 Antibody ELISA kit.
• Laboratory Quality Assurance Manual.
1. DOCUMENTATION
• All results, quality control records, and any corrective actions
must be documented in the laboratory information system (LIS)
and retained according to laboratory policy.
By following these procedures, the laboratory aims to ensure the
accurate and reliable quantification of GA1 antibodies in patient
samples, contributing to effective patient diagnosis and management.
