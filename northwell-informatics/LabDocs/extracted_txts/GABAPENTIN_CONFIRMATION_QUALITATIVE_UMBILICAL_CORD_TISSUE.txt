Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) GABAPENTIN
CONFIRMATION (QUALITATIVE), UMBILICAL CORD TISSUE
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this procedure is to ensure the
accurate and reliable qualitative confirmation of gabapentin in
umbilical cord tissue samples. This SOP outlines the steps to
be followed in the analytical phase of testing.
Responsibility: It is the responsibility of designated laboratory
personnel to perform qualitative confirmation testing for gabapentin in
umbilical cord tissue following this procedure. All staff must ensure
that quality control measures are adhered to and any deviations are
recorded and reported to the supervisor.
1. SPECIMEN Preferred:
• Umbilical cord tissue stored at -20°C until analysis.
• Minimum amount required: 2 grams.
Unacceptable:
• Specimens that are less than 2 grams.
• Specimens stored at room temperature for more than 24 hours
before being frozen.
• Specimens without proper identification (no patient information or
unique identifier).
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)
• Centrifuge
• Homogenizer
• Analytical balance
• Gabapentin standard (Certified Reference Material)
• Methanol (HPLC grade)
• Acetonitrile (HPLC grade)
• Formic acid (LC-MS grade)
• Deionized water
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Centrifuge tubes (15 mL and 50 mL)
• Sample vials for LC-MS/MS
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
1. PROCEDURE 4.1 Sample Preparation
2. Remove umbilical cord tissue samples from the freezer and
allow them to thaw at room temperature.
3. Weigh 2 grams of umbilical cord tissue using an analytical
balance.
4. Homogenize the tissue in 10 mL of methanol using a
homogenizer.
5. Centrifuge the homogenate at 3000 RPM for 15 minutes to
separate the supernatant.
6. Transfer the supernatant to a clean tube and evaporate it to
dryness under a stream of nitrogen or using a centrifugal
evaporator.
7. Reconstitute the dried residue in 1 mL of methanol and filter
through a 0.2 µm syringe filter into an LC-MS/MS sample vial.
4.2 Calibration and Quality Control
1. Prepare gabapentin standard solutions by diluting the certified
reference material with methanol.
2. Prepare a calibration curve by injecting standard solutions at
different concentrations into the LC-MS/MS.
3. Include a blank (methanol only) and quality control samples
(low, medium, and high concentrations) in each analytical
batch.
4.3 LC-MS/MS Analysis
1. Set up the LC-MS/MS according to the manufacturer's
instructions, using suitable parameters for gabapentin
detection.
2. Inject 10 µL of the prepared sample into the LC-MS/MS.
3. Run the analytical method to separate and detect gabapentin.
4. Monitor key ions for gabapentin and confirm its presence by
comparing retention time and mass spectra with those of the
gabapentin standard.
5. DATA INTERPRETATION AND REPORTING
6. Analyze the LC-MS/MS data to confirm the presence of
gabapentin by checking for the expected retention time and
mass spectral characteristics.
7. Validate the results with the calibration curve and quality control
samples.
8. Enter the results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
and mark them for review by a technologist.
9. Verify results and ensure all quality control criteria are met
before releasing the final report.
10. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform quality control checks with every analytical run.
• Use quality control samples to monitor the accuracy and reliability
of the analysis.
• Record and investigate any deviations from expected results.
1. SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS
• Use appropriate PPE, including lab coat, gloves, and eye
protection.
• Handle methanol, acetonitrile, and formic acid in a fume hood.
• Dispose of waste solvents according to laboratory safety
protocols.
