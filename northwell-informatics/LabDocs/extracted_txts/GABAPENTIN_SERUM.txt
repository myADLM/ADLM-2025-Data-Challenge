Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analysis of
GABAPENTIN, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to outline the steps necessary for
the analysis of GABAPENTIN in serum samples to ensure accurate
and reliable results.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all serum samples received for the
determination of GABAPENTIN levels in the laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the trained laboratory scientists to follow this
procedure accurately to ensure the integrity and validity of the test
results.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type:
• Serum
Collection Container:
• Red-top tube or serum separator tube (SST).
Specimen Volume:
• Minimum required volume: 1 mL serum.
Specimen Stability:
• Room Temperature: 24 hours
• Refrigerated (2-8°C): 7 days
• Frozen (-20°C): 1 year
Specimens should be promptly separated from clot or cells and
processed according to stability guidelines to maintain specimen
integrity.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Analytical balance
Reagents:
• Mobile phase components (e.g., methanol, water, acetonitrile,
buffer solutions)
• Calibration standards (GABAPENTIN)
• Internal standards
• Extraction solvents
Supplies:
• Sample vials
• Sample preparation tubes
• Filters or centrifuge tubes for sample clarification
6. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Ensure that all reagents and mobile phase components are
prepared and ready.
2. Verify calibration standards and internal standards are within
their expiration dates.
3. Set up the HPLC system and perform system suitability checks
as per manufacturer's guidelines.
Sample Preparation:
1. Centrifuge the blood samples at 3000 RPM for 10 minutes to
obtain clear serum.
2. Carefully transfer 500 µL of serum into a sample preparation
tube.
3. Add appropriate volume of internal standard to each sample
tube.
4. Perform protein precipitation or solid-phase extraction (SPE) as
per the validated protocol.
5. Centrifuge the sample tubes at 3000 RPM for 10 minutes to
clarify the supernatant.
6. Transfer the supernatant to a clean sample vial for HPLC
analysis.
HPLC Analysis:
1. Load the prepared sample vials into the HPLC auto-sampler.
2. Set the HPLC parameters according to the validated method for
GABAPENTIN detection (e.g., column type, mobile phase
composition, flow rate, detection wavelength).
3. Inject calibration standards and quality control samples to
generate a calibration curve.
4. Inject the prepared samples and run the HPLC analysis.
5. Collect and review the chromatograms for peak identification
and quantification based on the calibration curve.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include at least two levels of quality control (QC) samples (Low
and High concentration) in each analytical batch.
• QC samples should be prepared, analyzed, and documented
similarly to patient samples.
• Ensure that QC results fall within the defined acceptable range
prior to reporting patient results.
• Perform regular maintenance and calibration of the HPLC system
as per the manufacturer's guidelines.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Analyze data to determine GABAPENTIN concentrations in
patient serum samples.
• Validate and verify all results against QC data.
• Report results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
according to the standard reporting format.
• Document any deviations or errors observed during analysis and
take corrective actions as required.
Reference Intervals:
• Therapeutic range: 2.0 - 20.0 µg/mL
• Toxic level: > 25.0 µg/mL
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Potential interferences from other medications or endogenous
substances.
• Ensure the method's sensitivity and specificity are assessed
during validation.
