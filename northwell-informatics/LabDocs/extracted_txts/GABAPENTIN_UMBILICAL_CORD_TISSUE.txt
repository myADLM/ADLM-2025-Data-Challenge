1. PURPOSE
To provide standardized procedures for the analysis of gabapentin in
umbilical cord tissue specimens, ensuring accuracy, precision, and
reliability of test results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all laboratory personnel performing analysis
to follow the guidelines outlined in this SOP. Supervisors must ensure
that all personnel are trained and competent in this procedure and
that quality control measures are consistently applied.

4. DEFINITIONS
• Specimen: Umbilical cord tissue received from patient.
• Internal Standard: A compound chemically similar to the analyte
(gabapentin) used to improve the precision and accuracy of the
assay.
5. PROCEDURE
A) Sample Preparation:
1. Tissue Homogenization:
◦ Weigh approximately 200 mg of umbilical cord tissue using
an analytical balance.
◦ Place the tissue into a 15 mL centrifuge tube and add 2 mL
of lysis buffer.
◦ Homogenize the tissue using a homogenizer or tissue
grinder until a uniform mixture is obtained.
2. Internal Standard Addition:
◦ Add an appropriate volume (e.g., 10 µL) of internal standard
solution to the homogenized sample.
3. Protein Precipitation and Extraction:
◦ Transfer the homogenized sample to a 2 mL screw cap
tube.
◦ Add 1 mL of methanol to precipitate proteins.
◦ Vortex the mixture for 30 seconds.
◦ Centrifuge the tube at 10,000 rpm for 10 minutes at 4°C.
◦ Carefully transfer the supernatant to a new 2 mL screw cap
tube.
4. Drying and Reconstitution:
◦ Evaporate the supernatant to dryness under a stream of
nitrogen at 37°C.
◦ Reconstitute the dried residue in 200 µL of Mobile Phase A
(0.1% Formic Acid in Water).
◦ Vortex and then centrifuge the reconstituted sample at
10,000 rpm for 5 minutes.
5. Sample Filtration:
◦ Transfer the supernatant to an HPLC vial equipped with an
insert for HPLC-MS/MS analysis.
B) Instrumental Analysis:
1. HPLC-MS/MS Settings:
◦ Employ a reverse-phase HPLC column suitable for
separating gabapentin.
◦ Use a gradient elution with Mobile Phase A and Mobile
Phase B at a flow rate of 0.3 mL/min.
◦ Set the MS/MS detector in positive ion mode for gabapentin
detection.
◦ Utilize multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) for specific
gabapentin and internal standard transitions.
2. Calibration Curve:
◦ Prepare calibration standards of gabapentin in the same
matrix as the samples.
◦ Include a blank sample, calibration standards, QC samples,
and samples for each run.
◦ Construct a calibration curve by plotting the response ratio
of gabapentin to the internal standard versus concentration.
C) Quality Control:
1. QC Samples:
◦ Analyze quality control (QC) samples with each batch of
specimens.
◦ QC samples must be matrix-matched and cover the
expected concentration range of gabapentin.
2. Acceptance Criteria:
◦ QC results must be within ±15% of the nominal
concentrations except at the lower limit of quantification
(LLOQ), where ±20% is acceptable.
◦ Any batch not meeting QC acceptance criteria must be
reanalyzed.
D) Reporting Results:
1. Data Analysis:
◦ Quantify gabapentin by comparing the peak area ratios of
the analyte to the internal standard with the calibration
curve.
◦ Ensure that all data are reviewed and verified by a
technologist.
2. Result Reporting:
◦ Report gabapentin concentrations in ug/g of umbilical cord
tissue.
◦ Document any observations of potential interference or
anomalies.
6. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS
• Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) including
gloves, lab coat, and safety glasses.
• Handle all biological samples and reagents according to
laboratory safety protocols.
• Ensure all waste, particularly biological and chemical, is disposed
of following laboratory safety guidelines.
