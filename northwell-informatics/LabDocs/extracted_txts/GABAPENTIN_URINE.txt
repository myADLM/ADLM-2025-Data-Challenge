Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Gabapentin in Urine
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for the analysis and reporting of gabapentin
levels in urine specimens in the laboratory.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of designated laboratory staff to perform and
document the analysis of gabapentin in urine following this
procedure. Supervisors are responsible for ensuring that staff
members are trained and the procedure is followed.
1. SPECIMEN
Preferred/Acceptable:
• 20 mL freshly collected urine in a clean, dry, and properly labeled
container.
Unacceptable:
• Urine specimens that are suspected to be contaminated, diluted,
or not properly labeled.
• Urine specimens that are greater than 72 hours old if kept at room
temperature or over a week if refrigerated at 2-8°C.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)
System
• Centrifuge
• Urine collection containers
• Sample preparation materials (pipettes, microcentrifuge tubes,
etc.)
• Internal standards and calibration standards for gabapentin
• Quality control materials
1. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Centrifuge the urine sample at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes to
remove particulate matter.
2. Transfer a clear supernatant to a new labeled microcentrifuge
tube for analysis.
Sample Preparation:
1. Prepare calibration standards and quality control samples from
stock solutions of gabapentin.
2. Spike 200 μL of the urine sample, calibration standard, and
quality control sample with an appropriate volume of internal
standard solution.
3. Vortex the samples for 30 seconds.
4. Allow the samples to sit for 10 minutes to ensure extraction.
5. Transfer the prepared samples to labeled autosampler vials.
Instrument Calibration:
1. Perform full system calibration using prepared gabapentin
standards.
2. Ensure the instrument response is linear across the expected
concentration range.
3. Confirm system suitability by running quality control samples
before analyzing patient specimens.
Analysis:
1. Load the prepared samples onto the LC-MS/MS system.
2. Create a run sequence consisting of calibration standards,
quality controls, blank runs, and patient samples.
3. Inject the samples according to the sequence.
4. Monitor the retention time and specific mass transitions (parent
to daughter ions) for gabapentin.
5. Assess the signal-to-noise ratio to ensure detectability and
specificity.
Data Analysis:
1. Analyze the chromatograms for each sample.
2. Quantify the concentration of gabapentin in patient urine
samples by comparing the sample response to the calibration
curve.
3. Validate the accuracy of results using quality control samples.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
5. Perform quality control checks using two levels of control
materials at the beginning and end of each batch of samples.
6. Document all quality control results in a QC log.
7. Investigate and resolve any out-of-specification results before
releasing patient results.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
9. Review data for each patient sample.
10. Verify that all quality control results fall within acceptable limits
before result release.
11. Enter patient results into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
12. Documents any deviation in instrument performance, sample
integrity issues, or other anomalies.
13. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Reference intervals for gabapentin in urine should be established
and documented based on clinical relevance and population-
specific data.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Ensure specimens are procured, stored, and handled correctly to
avoid potential degradation or contamination.
• Cross-reactivity with other substances should be documented and
avoided as per instrument manufacturer guidelines.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's instructions for the LC-MS/MS system.
• Scientific literature regarding gabapentin pharmacokinetics and its
detection in urine.
This protocol should be reviewed and updated periodically or as new
information becomes available. Staff should be trained and
competency assessed regularly.
