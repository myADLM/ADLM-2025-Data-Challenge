Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Title: Analytical Phase for
Gadolinium, 24-Hour Urine Testing Document Number: SOP-
UR-2023-01 Version: 1.0 Effective Date: [Effective Date] Approved
By: [Lab Director's Name]
1. PURPOSE
To establish a standard procedure for the analysis of Gadolinium in
24-hour urine specimens ensuring accurate, precise, and reliable test
results.
1. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• Nitric acid (trace metal grade)
• Deionized water
• Gadolinium standard solutions
• Internal standard solution (recommended: Iridium or Indium)
• Plastic containers free from metals
• Disposable pipette tips
• Calibration standards (ranging from 0.1 µg/L to 100 µg/L)
1. EQUIPMENT
• Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer (ICP-MS) or
equivalent
• Analytical balance (accuracy ±0.01 g)
• Centrifuge
• Microwave digestion system or a heat block
• Vortex mixer
• Polypropylene tubes (15 mL and 50 mL)
• Clean, dry plastic tubes for aliquoting samples
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
• Specimen Type: 24-hour urine sample
• Volume: Minimum 10 mL from the 24-hour collection
• Storage: Refrigerate specimen at 2-8°C during collection. After
collection, refrigerate until processing.
• Stability: Specimen is stable refrigerated for up to 48 hours post-
collection.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens with no collection time/date indicated.
• Insufficient volume for analysis.
• Specimens contaminated with metals.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Use certified reference materials for quality control.
• Include positive and negative controls with each batch of
samples.
• Calibration verification should be performed at the beginning and
end of each run.
• Internal standards should be used to account for matrix effects
and instrument drift.
1. PROCEDURE
Pre-Analysis:
1. Record the total volume of the 24-hour urine collection.
2. Mix the urine thoroughly to ensure homogeneity.
Sample Preparation:
1. Aliquot 10 mL of urine into a clean, labeled polypropylene tube.
2. Add 1 mL of trace metal grade nitric acid to each sample to
acidify and assist in digestion.
3. Vortex the samples to mix thoroughly.
4. If using a microwave digestion system, follow the
manufacturer’s instructions for urine sample digestion.
◦ Alternatively, heat the samples on a heat block at 80°C for 2
hours.
5. Allow the samples to cool to room temperature.
6. Centrifuge samples at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes to remove any
particulates.
7. Transfer the supernatant into a clean, labeled plastic tube.
Instrumental Analysis:
1. Calibrate the ICP-MS using the prepared gadolinium standards.
2. Analyze the quality control samples to verify the calibration
curve.
3. Inject the prepared urine sample aliquots into the ICP-MS.
4. Use the internal standard method to correct for any fluctuations
in instrument response.
Post-Analysis:
1. Validate the results by evaluating calibration and quality control
performance.
2. Reanalyze samples that fall outside of calibration range or fail
quality control checks.
3. Calculate the concentration of gadolinium in the 24-hour urine
sample.
Calculations:
• Calculate the amount of gadolinium excreted over 24 hours based
on the total urine volume: [ \text{Total Gadolinium (µg)} =
\text{Measured Concentration (µg/L)} \times \text{Total Volume
(L)} ]
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Document results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• The final report should include the concentration of gadolinium in
µg/L and the total excreted amount in the 24-hour period.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Reference intervals should be based on population studies or
established literature. If not available, refer to recommendations
from clinical guidelines.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Ensure accurate collection and preservation of urine samples to
avoid metal contamination.
• High concentrations of interfering substances may affect
accuracy; consider sample dilution if necessary.
