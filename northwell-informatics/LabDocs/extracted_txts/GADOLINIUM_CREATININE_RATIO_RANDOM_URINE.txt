Protocol for Generating Results for Gadolinium/Creatinine Ratio,
Random, Urine
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized method for the analysis of gadolinium to
creatinine ratio in random urine samples to ensure quality and
consistency in results.
1. SCOPE
This protocol applies to all clinical laboratory scientists and
technicians conducting the gadolinium/creatinine ratio test in the
laboratory.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all trained laboratory staff to perform this
procedure according to the guidelines and ensure that all steps are
carefully followed. Any deviations, issues, or uncertainties must be
reported to the supervisor immediately.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Sample Type: Random urine sample.
Collection Container: Clean and dry specimen container, preferably a
urine cup.
Volume: Collect a minimum of 10 mL of random urine.
Storage:
• Refrigerated: 2-8°C for up to 48 hours.
• If long-term storage is required, store samples frozen at -20°C.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens collected in containers with preservatives.
• Specimens with visible contamination.
• Specimens with less than 5 mL of urine.
• Specimens that have been at room temperature for more than 2
hours.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, and SUPPLIES
• Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer (ICP-MS) for
gadolinium measurement.
• Creatinine assay reagents and analyzer (Jaffe method or
enzymatic assay).
• Calibrators and quality control materials for both gadolinium and
creatinine assays.
• Volumetric pipettes.
• Centrifuge.
• Sterile microcentrifuge tubes or aliquot containers.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation: i. Verify specimen integrity and identification. ii.
Ensure that all instruments (ICP-MS and creatinine analyzer) are
properly calibrated and maintained.
B. Aliquoting: i. Mix the urine sample thoroughly. ii. Aliquot 1-2 mL of
the urine sample into two separate microcentrifuge tubes: one for
gadolinium measurement and the other for creatinine measurement.
C. Analysis: i. Gadolinium Measurement (ICP-MS): - Dilute the
urine sample appropriately as per the ICP-MS protocol (e.g., 1:10). -
Analyze the diluted sample using ICP-MS. - Record the gadolinium
concentration obtained from the instrument in ng/mL.
ii. Creatinine Measurement (Creatinine Analyzer): - Follow the
manufacturer’s procedure for creatinine assay. - Measure the
creatinine concentration. - Record the creatinine concentration
obtained from the instrument in mg/dL or µmol/L.
D. Calculation:
• Calculate the gadolinium/creatinine ratio using the formula: [
\text{Gadolinium/Creatinine Ratio} = \frac{\text{Gadolinium
concentration (ng/mL)}}{\text{Creatinine concentration (mg/dL) or
(µmol/L)}} ]
E. Quality Control:
• Run appropriate controls, both low and high, for gadolinium and
creatinine.
• Verify the control results fall within the acceptable range before
processing patient samples.
• Document all quality control results in the quality control log.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Enter the gadolinium/creatinine ratio results into the Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
• Review and verify results before final release. Ensure no critical
values or calculations are missed.
• In case of any analytical issues or unexpected results, consult
with the supervisor before reporting.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Establish and validate reference intervals for the gadolinium/
creatinine ratio specific to your laboratory based on the population
served and the recommendations from authoritative sources.
1. LIMITATIONS
• Ensure proper specimen handling and storage to avoid
degradation or contamination.
• Matrix effects or interference from other substances present in
urine may affect gadolinium measurement accuracy.
• High creatinine concentration may influence the accuracy of the
ratio calculation.

• Supplier’s insert for ICP-MS and creatinine assay kits.
• Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines.
• Relevant scientific literature and authoritative guidelines on
gadolinium/creatinine ratio analysis.
1. DOCUMENTATION
• Complete all required documentation including the specimens
processed, quality control results, calibration records, and
corrective actions if any issues occurred during the testing
procedure.
• Ensure that all records are accurately maintained as per the
laboratory’s specific guidelines and regulatory requirements.
1. REVISION HISTORY
• Document any changes or updates to this protocol with relevant
dates and authorization.
