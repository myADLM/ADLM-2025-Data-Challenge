Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Analytical Phase for
Generating Results for Gadolinium/Creatinine Ratio, Urine
1. Purpose:
To outline the procedure for analyzing Gadolinium and Creatinine in
urine specimens and calculating the Gadolinium/Creatinine ratio.
1. Scope:
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel who perform urine
analysis for Gadolinium and Creatinine. It assists in maintaining
accurate and consistent results for analytical measurements and
subsequent calculations.
1. Responsibilities:
• Laboratory technologists are responsible for performing and
documenting the analysis following this SOP.
• Supervisors ensure that all laboratory technologists are trained in
this procedure and comply with the SOP.
• Quality assurance personnel are responsible for monitoring and
validating the process.
1. Specimen Requirements and Stability:
• Specimen Type: 10 mL freshly voided urine collected in a clean,
dry container.
• Handling: Ensure specimens are sent to the laboratory promptly
and kept at room temperature if testing is to occur within 6 hours.
If testing is delayed, refrigerate specimens and bring them to
room temperature prior to analysis.
• Unacceptable Specimens:
◦ Specimens arriving more than 6 hours after collection without
refrigeration.
◦ Specimens lacking collection date/time.
◦ Specimens with visible contamination or evidence of improper
handling.
1. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies:
• Equipment:
◦ Spectrophotometer for Creatinine quantification.
◦ ICP-MS (Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry) for
Gadolinium quantification.
◦ Calibrated micropipettes.
• Reagents:
◦ Gadolinium standard solution.
◦ Creatinine reagent kit.
◦ Control urine samples – 2 levels (normal and elevated).
1. Procedure:
A) Creatinine Quantification:
1. Mix the urine specimen thoroughly and transfer a 1 mL aliquot
to a clean test tube.
2. Follow the instructions for the Creatinine reagent kit:
◦ Add appropriate volume of reagents as per manufacturer's
protocol.
◦ Incubate and measure absorbance at the specific
wavelength (generally around 490 nm) using a
spectrophotometer.
3. Calibration and control samples must be included in each run.
4. Calculate Creatinine concentration based on the standard curve
and manufacturer's guidelines.
B) Gadolinium Quantification:
1. Prepare urine specimen by acid digestion if required, following
standard laboratory safety procedures.
2. Dilute the specimen as necessary using deionized water.
3. Calibrate the ICP-MS according to the manufacturer's
instructions using Gadolinium standard solutions.
4. Analyze the urine specimen for Gadolinium concentration using
ICP-MS.
5. Ensure that calibration and control samples are included in
each run.
6. Data from ICP-MS should be reviewed for consistency and
accuracy.
C) Calculating Gadolinium/Creatinine Ratio:
1. Record the concentrations of Gadolinium and Creatinine
obtained from the respective analyses.
2. Calculate the Gadolinium/Creatinine ratio using the formula:
[ \text{Gadolinium/Creatinine Ratio} = \frac{[\text{Gadolinium in
µg/L}]}{[\text{Creatinine in mg/L}]} ]
3. Document the ratio in the patient's lab report.
4. Quality Control:
• Run internal quality control samples (normal, elevated levels) for
both Gadolinium and Creatinine assays at the start of each batch.
• Verify calibration curves and control results before accepting
patient results.
• Maintain documentation for control sample results and corrective
actions in case of deviations.
1. Reporting Results:
• Results are reviewed and verified by trained laboratory personnel.
• Ensure all data is accurately transferred into the Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
• Critical results and significant deviations should be immediately
reported to the appropriate healthcare provider following
established protocols.
1. Reference Intervals:
• Establish reference intervals for Gadolinium and Creatinine based
on historical data and manufacturer's recommendations. Update
these intervals periodically based on population studies.
1. Troubleshooting:
Refer to equipment and reagent manuals for troubleshooting steps. If
persistent issues occur, notify the supervisor and consult with the
manufacturer’s technical support.
1. Documentation:
Ensure to document all results, QC outcomes, calibration data, and
corrective actions in the designated log books and LIS.
1. References:
• Manufacturer's manual for ICP-MS.
• Creatinine reagent kit instructions sheet.
• Established laboratory protocols for urine analysis.
This SOP provides comprehensive instructions for laboratory
technique and ensures reliable and accurate results for the
Gadolinium/Creatinine ratio in urine samples. Compliance with these
guidelines maintains the integrity and quality of the laboratory
procedures.
