Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for GADOLINIUM, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized protocol for performing serum gadolinium
analysis in the laboratory, ensuring consistent, accurate, and reliable
results.
Responsibility:
• It is the responsibility of the designated staff to perform the
analysis following this SOP.
• The supervising technologist must ensure compliance with this
protocol and address any identified issues immediately.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Acceptable Specimen:
• Serum collected in a plain red-top tube or serum gel separator
tube.
• Minimal volume required: 1 mL of serum.
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Plasma samples.
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
• Specimens collected in tubes containing anticoagulants such as
EDTA, heparin, or citrate.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer (ICP-MS)
• Calibration standards for gadolinium
• Quality control material with known gadolinium levels
• Nitric acid for digestion
• Disposable syringes and filters (0.45 μm)
• Deionized water
1. PROCEDURE
Specimen Preparation:
1. Verify specimen identity and integrity upon receipt.
2. Centrifuge samples at 3000 RPM for 10 minutes to obtain clear
serum.
3. Transfer serum to a clean polypropylene tube, avoiding
hemolysis and contamination.
4. Dilute serum with deionized water and nitric acid as per
calibration curve requirements.
Equipment Preparation: 5. Calibrate the ICP-MS according to the
manufacturer’s instructions using prepared gadolinium standards. 6.
Perform system checks and ensure that all instrument parameters
are optimized for gadolinium detection.
Sample Analysis: 7. Run quality control samples at the beginning
and end of each batch to ensure the instrument is functioning
correctly. 8. Introduce a blank sample and gadolinium calibration
standards of known concentrations to create a calibration curve. 9.
Aspirate diluted serum specimens into the ICP-MS and measure the
gadolinium concentration. 10. Document all calibration, control, and
patient sample results accurately.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run internal quality control samples at multiple concentrations
with each batch of patient samples.
• The acceptable range for controls must fall within ±2 standard
deviations of the known target value.
• If control results fall outside this range, troubleshoot the
instrument and reanalyze the samples.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Transmit results directly from the ICP-MS to the Laboratory
Information System (LIS) for review and verification.
• The technologist must review all results for accuracy and
consistency before verification.
• Any flagged or abnormal results must be validated and confirmed
by repeating the analysis or performing additional testing as
required.
1. REFERENCE INTERVAL
Gadolinium, Serum:
• Normal: < 0.02 μg/L
• Elevated levels should be correlated to clinical symptoms and
MRI contrast administration history.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If the instrument fails to analyze a sample correctly, refer to the
manufacturer’s troubleshooting guide.
• Repeat the analysis with fresh preparation if sample integrity is in
question.
• Consult the supervising technologist if persistent issues or
deviation outside acceptable limits occur.
1. DOCUMENTATION
• Ensure proper documentation of all calibration, control, and
patient sample results, including any corrective actions taken.
• Maintain logs for instrument maintenance, calibration, and quality
control for audit purposes.

This SOP must be reviewed annually and updated as necessary to
reflect any changes in methodology, instrumentation, or clinical
guidelines.
