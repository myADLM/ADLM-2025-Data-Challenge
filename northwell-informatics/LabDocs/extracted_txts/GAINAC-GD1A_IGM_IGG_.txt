Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase for Generating Results for GAINAC-GD1A
(IgM & IgG)
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this SOP is to provide standardized
procedures for the accurate analysis and reporting of results for
GAINAC-GD1A (IgM & IgG) tests in the laboratory.
2. SCOPE This SOP applies to the measurement of GAINAC-GD1A
(IgM & IgG) levels in samples received in the laboratory. It includes
steps for analysis, quality control, and result reporting.
3. DEFINITIONS
• GAINAC-GD1A: Anti-Ganglioside antibodies associated with
certain neurological disorders.
• IgM: Immunoglobulin M
• IgG: Immunoglobulin G
• LIS: Laboratory Information System
• QC: Quality Control
4. RESPONSIBILITY
• All lab personnel who perform analysis of GAINAC-GD1A (IgM &
IgG) are responsible for adhering to this SOP.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring compliance with this
SOP and for providing necessary training to staff.
5. PROCEDURE
A. SPECIMEN HANDLING
1. Specimen Requirements:
◦ Serum samples are the preferred specimen type.
◦ Specimen volume: Minimum of 0.5 ml serum.
◦ Transport and store serum samples at 2-8°C until analysis.
◦ Avoid hemolysis as it may interfere with test results.
2. Specimen Rejection Criteria:
◦ Specimens that are hemolyzed, lipemic, or contaminated.
◦ Specimens received outside the expected time frame.
◦ Insufficient specimen volume.
B. REAGENTS & EQUIPMENT
1. Reagents:
◦ GAINAC-GD1A (IgM & IgG) reagent kits.
◦ Quality control materials (positive and negative controls)
2. Equipment:
◦ Microplate reader.
◦ Pipettes and disposable tips.
◦ Incubators maintained at specific temperatures as defined in
kit instructions.
C. ANALYSIS PROCEDURE
1. Preparation:
◦ Allow all reagents and samples to reach room temperature.
◦ Thoroughly mix all reagents unless specified otherwise.
2. Assay Procedure:
◦ Label microplate wells according to provided template.
◦ Pipette 100 µl of standards, controls, and patient serum
samples into designated wells.
◦ Add enzyme conjugate to each well according to kit
instructions.
◦ Cover microplate and incubate at the specified temperature
for the recommended duration.
◦ Perform washing steps as indicated in the kit instructions.
◦ Add substrate solution and incubate for the recommended
time.
◦ Stop the reaction by adding the stop solution as per the kit's
guidance.
◦ Measure absorbance of each well at the appropriate
wavelength per kit instructions using a microplate reader.
D. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Internal QC:
◦ Run positive and negative controls alongside patient
samples in each analytical batch.
◦ Document all control results; they must fall within the
specified ranges before patient results can be reported.
2. Troubleshooting:
◦ If QC fails, recheck reagents and equipment, and repeat
analysis.
◦ If repeated QC fails, discontinue patient testing and notify
the supervisor.
E. RESULT INTERPRETATION
1. Calculation:
◦ Calculate the concentration of IgM & IgG in patient samples
using the standard curve generated from the known
standards.
◦ Validate results by comparing with the QC data.
2. Reference Intervals:
◦ Establish or verify reference intervals specific to the
laboratory and patient population using kit guidelines or
existing laboratory data.
F. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Documentation:
◦ Enter test results into the LIS, ensuring accuracy and
completeness.
◦ Review all results for inconsistency or anomalies.
2. Critical Results:
◦ Any critical or unexpected results should be confirmed by
repeat testing.
◦ Immediately report critical results to the healthcare provider
as per laboratory policy.
G. MAINTENANCE AND TROUBLESHOOTING
1. Equipment Maintenance:
◦ Follow the manufacturer's instructions for routine
maintenance and calibration of the microplate reader and
other equipment.
◦ Document all maintenance activities in the equipment log.
2. Troubleshooting:
◦ Address any anomalies in sample processing or equipment
function immediately.
◦ Consult with the supervisor for unresolved issues.
