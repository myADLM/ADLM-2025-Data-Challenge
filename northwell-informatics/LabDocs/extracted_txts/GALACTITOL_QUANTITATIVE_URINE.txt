Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Galactitol, Quantitative, Urine
1. PURPOSE
This procedure outlines the analytical process for generating
quantitative results for Galactitol in urine samples. It ensures
standardized, accurate, and reproducible results, complying with
CLIA-certified laboratory standards.
Responsibility: It is the responsibility of trained laboratory personnel
to perform the analysis, document results, and maintain equipment
as per this SOP.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/acceptable:
• 10 mL fresh urine collected in a sterile container and stored
refrigerated (2-8°C) within 2 hours of collection.
Unacceptable:
• Specimens received more than 24 hours after collection if not
refrigerated.
• Contaminated or improperly labeled specimens.
• Inadequate specimen volume (<10 mL).
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system with
refractive index detector
• Analytic standards of galactitol
• Internal standard (e.g., erythritol)
• Reagent-grade water
• Acetonitrile
• Ammonium acetate buffer (pH 5.0)
• Sterile urine collection containers
• Micropipettes and tips
• Analytical balance
• Centrifuge
• HPLC vials and caps
• Disposal containers (for biohazardous waste)
1. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation
1. Collect 10 mL fresh urine and refrigerate if not analyzed
immediately.
2. Centrifuge the urine sample at 3,000 rpm for 10 minutes to
remove particulate matter.
3. Use a micropipette to transfer 1 mL of the clear supernatant into
a clean microcentrifuge tube.
4. Add 100 µL of internal standard solution to the sample and
vortex for 30 seconds.
5. Filter the sample through a 0.45 µm syringe filter directly into an
HPLC vial and cap securely.
B. HPLC Analysis
1. Set up the HPLC system according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
2. Equilibrate the HPLC column with the mobile phase
(acetonitrile:ammonium acetate buffer, 70:30 v/v) for at least 30
minutes or until the baseline is stable.
3. Set the flow rate of the mobile phase to 1.0 mL/min.
4. Inject 20 µL of the prepared sample into the HPLC system.
5. Run the sample through the column and detect galactitol using
the refractive index detector.
6. Record the retention times and peak areas for analyte
(galactitol) and the internal standard.
C. Calibration and Quantitation
1. Prepare a calibration curve using galactitol standards at
concentrations of 0, 10, 50, 100, 250, and 500 µmol/L.
2. Process the standards in the same manner as the urine
samples, including the addition of internal standard.
3. Construct the calibration curve by plotting the peak area ratio of
galactitol to the internal standard against the concentration of
galactitol standards.
4. Use the calibration curve to determine the concentration of
galactitol in urine samples by comparing the peak area ratio of
the sample to the calibration curve.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include a blank control (reagent without urine) and quality control
samples (known concentrations of galactitol) with each analytical
batch.
• Analyze control samples in parallel with patient samples to ensure
method accuracy and precision.
• Re-run the assay if quality control results are not within the
acceptable range.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results are reported in µmol/L.
• Enter the patient’s results into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
• Review and verify results for accuracy before reporting.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Ensure proper calibration and maintenance of the HPLC system.
• Potential interfering substances in urine should be acknowledged
and controlled.
• Follow a rigorous sample preparation process to avoid handling
contamination or degradation.
