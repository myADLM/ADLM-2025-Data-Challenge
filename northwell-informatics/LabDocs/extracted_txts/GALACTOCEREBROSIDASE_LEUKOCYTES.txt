Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Protocol for Analytical Phase of Generating Results for
GALACTOCEREBROSIDASE, LEUKOCYTES
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the procedure for the analytical phase of
measuring galactocerebrosidase activity in leukocytes. The objective
is to ensure accurate, timely, and reproducible results that are critical
for the diagnosis of Krabbe disease and other disorders related to
galactocerebrosidase deficiency.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
• Laboratory Technologists: Perform the analysis as described in
this SOP, including preparation, processing, and analysis of
samples.
• Supervisors: Ensure adherence to this SOP, and address any
issues or discrepancies that may arise during testing.
• Quality Control Personnel: Monitor quality control procedures
and maintain records to ensure accuracy and compliance with
established standards.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Type: Whole blood collected in EDTA tubes.
• Volume: Minimum 5 mL of whole blood.
• Stability: Specimens must be processed within 48 hours of
collection.
• Storage: Refrigerate samples at 2-8°C if they cannot be
processed immediately.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Centrifuge
• Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)
• Manual cell counter or automated cell counter
• Lysis buffer
• Substrate solution for galactocerebrosidase
• Reaction buffer
• Stop solution
• Spectrophotometer
• Galactocerebrosidase assay standards and controls
1. PROCEDURE
a. Sample Preparation
1. Centrifuge whole blood at 3000 RPM for 10 minutes to separate
plasma from leukocytes.
2. Carefully collect the buffy coat (containing leukocytes) into a
clean tube.
3. Add 5-10 mL of PBS to the tube and gently mix.
4. Centrifuge again at 1500 RPM for 10 minutes and discard the
supernatant.
5. Resuspend the pellet in PBS and repeat the wash procedure
twice more.
b. Cell Counting
1. Count the leukocytes using a manual or automated cell counter.
2. Adjust the cell concentration to 1 x 10^6 cells/mL using PBS.
c. Enzyme Assay
1. Prepare reaction mixtures containing identical volumes of
reaction buffer, substrate solution, and leukocyte suspension.
2. Incubate the reaction mixtures at 37°C for 1 hour.
3. Stop the enzyme reaction by adding the stop solution.
4. Measure the optical density using a spectrophotometer at the
specified wavelength (usually 405nm).
d. Quality Control
1. Run quality control samples containing known concentrations of
galactocerebrosidase in parallel with patient samples.
2. Ensure that the results for quality control samples fall within the
established acceptable range before reporting patient results.
3. CALCULATIONS AND REPORTING RESULTS
• Compare the absorbance readings of the samples to the standard
curve generated from the assay standards.
• Calculate the galactocerebrosidase activity in nmol/mg protein/hr.
• Report results in nmol/mg protein/hr and note any deviations or
abnormalities found during the analysis in the laboratory
information system (LIS).
• Verify all results according to laboratory procedures prior to final
reporting.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run internal quality controls with each batch of samples and
document the results.
• Perform proficiency testing and inter-laboratory comparisons as
part of the quality assurance program.
• Maintain documentation for instrument calibration, maintenance
logs, and quality control results, adhering to regulatory standards.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
The specific reference intervals for galactocerebrosidase activity will
be established based on population studies and verified within the
laboratory. These intervals must be reviewed periodically and
updated as necessary.
1. LIMITATIONS
• Hemolysis, lipemia, or other sample interferences can affect the
accuracy of the assay.
• Leukocyte counts must be precise; deviations can result in
erroneous enzyme activity measurements.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's instructions for the galactocerebrosidase assay kit.
• Relevant clinical guidelines and literature on
galactocerebrosidase and Krabbe disease.
This SOP is to be reviewed bi-annually and amended as necessary
to incorporate new techniques, instruments, or regulations. Staff must
be trained in the use of this SOP and competency assessed
regularly.
