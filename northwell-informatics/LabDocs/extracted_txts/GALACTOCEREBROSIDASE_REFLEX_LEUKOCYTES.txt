Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for
Analytical Phase of Generating Results for
GALACTOCEREBROSIDASE REFLEX,
LEUKOCYTES
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for the accurate and timely analysis of
galactocerebrosidase activity in leukocytes, ensuring reliable
results for diagnostic purposes.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
◦ Qualified laboratory technologists are responsible for
performing the analysis according to this procedure.
◦ Supervisors must ensure all staff are trained and adhere to
this SOP.
3. DEFINITION
Galactocerebrosidase Reflex: A test measuring the enzyme
galactocerebrosidase in leukocytes to diagnose disorders such
as Krabbe disease.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
◦ Specimen Type: Peripheral blood.
◦ Anticoagulant: EDTA.
◦ Volume: Minimum of 5 mL.
◦ Transport: Refrigerated (2-8°C). Must arrive in the
laboratory within 48 hours of collection.
◦ Unacceptable Conditions: Hemolyzed samples, samples
>48 hours old, incorrect anticoagulant.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
◦ Centrifuge
◦ Refrigerated microcentrifuge
◦ Lysis buffer
◦ Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)
◦ Galactocerebrosidase activity assay kit
◦ Standard micropipettes and tips
◦ Incubator set at 37°C
◦ Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) reader
◦ Calibrated control samples (positive and negative)
6. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation and Isolation of Leukocytes:
1. Centrifugation:
▪ Centrifuge the blood sample at 500xg for 10 minutes
at 4°C to separate plasma.
▪ Carefully aspirate the plasma and retain the buffy coat
containing leukocytes.
2. Lysis:
▪ Resuspend the buffy coat in lysis buffer.
▪ Incubate on ice for 10 minutes to lyse red blood cells.
3. Washing:
▪ Centrifuge at 300xg for 5 minutes at 4°C.
▪ Discard the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in
PBS.
▪ Repeat the washing step two more times.
B. Galactocerebrosidase Activity Assay:
1. Incubation:
▪ Prepare reaction mixtures according to the
galactocerebrosidase assay kit instructions.
▪ Add leukocyte lysate to the reaction buffer and
incubate at 37°C for the specified time.
2. Measurement:
▪ Stop the reaction as per the kit protocol.
▪ Measure the enzyme activity using an ELISA reader
set to the appropriate wavelength stated in the kit.
C. Quality Control:
◦ Run positive and negative controls with each batch of
patient samples.
◦ Ensure controls fall within the expected ranges. If controls
fail, troubleshoot and repeat the assay.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ Reference Intervals:
▪ Specific reference ranges for galactocerebrosidase
activity should be used based on laboratory standards or
literature values.
◦ Documentation:
▪ Results should be reviewed and verified by a laboratory
technologist.
▪ Enter results into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS) with appropriate comments if any interfering factors
were noted.
◦ Critical Values:
▪ Values indicative of severe enzyme deficiency should be
flagged and reported to the requesting physician
immediately.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
◦ Refer to the assay kit insert for potential sources of
interference and limitations.
◦ Ensure no cross-reactivity with other leukocyte enzymes.
9. REFERENCES
◦ Assay kit manual from the manufacturer for specific details
about reagents, incubation times, and measurement
settings.
◦ Clinical literature on galactocerebrosidase activity and
Krabbe disease diagnostics.
10. REVISION AND APPROVAL
• This SOP will be reviewed annually and updated as necessary to
reflect changes in procedures or regulations.
• Approval by Laboratory Director before implementation.
This SOP ensures standardized processing and analysis of
galactocerebrosidase reflex in leukocytes to maintain high-quality
diagnostic services.
