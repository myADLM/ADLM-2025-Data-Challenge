Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Galactokinase, Blood Test
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the procedure for the analysis of galactokinase
(GALK) activity in blood samples. Accurate determination of
galactokinase activity is crucial for diagnosing galactokinase
deficiency, a metabolic disorder that can lead to cataracts and other
complications if left untreated.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory technologists are responsible for
conducting the analysis and documenting results according to this
SOP.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring compliance with the
procedure and addressing any issues that arise during the
analytical phase.
1. DEFINITION
Galactokinase (GALK) is an enzyme that catalyzes the
phosphorylation of galactose to galactose-1-phosphate. Its activity
level in the blood can indicate the presence of galactokinase
deficiency.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Whole Blood, preferably collected in a
heparinized tube. Lithium heparin is preferred to avoid dilution.
• Specimen Volume: A minimum of 1 mL of whole blood.
• Specimen Stability: Specimens should be kept refrigerated
(2-8°C) and analyzed within 24 hours of collection. If immediate
analysis is not possible, specimens can be frozen at -20°C for up
to 1 month.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Equipment:
◦ Centrifuge
◦ Spectrophotometer capable of measuring absorbance at 340
nm
◦ Incubator set to 37°C
◦ Vortex mixer
◦ Pipettes (variable volumes)
• Reagents:
◦ Galactose substrate solution (50 mM)
◦ ATP solution (100 mM)
◦ NADP+ solution (10 mM)
◦ Hexokinase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase enzyme
mix
◦ Lysis buffer (pH 7.4)
• Supplies:
◦ Disposable cuvettes
◦ Microcentrifuge tubes
◦ Heparinized blood collection tubes
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation of the Working Standards and Reagents
1. Prepare a 50 mM galactose substrate solution.
2. Prepare a 100 mM ATP solution.
3. Prepare a 10 mM NADP+ solution.
4. Prepare the enzyme mix containing hexokinase and glucose-6-
phosphate dehydrogenase according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
5. Ensure all reagents are stored at the recommended
temperatures and properly labeled with preparation and expiry
dates.
B. Preparation of the Sample
1. Centrifuge the heparinized whole blood sample at 3000 RPM
for 10 minutes at 4°C.
2. Carefully collect the plasma supernatant.
3. Prepare the reaction mixture in a cuvette: add 50 μL of plasma,
450 μL of lysis buffer, 50 μL of galactose substrate solution, 25
μL of ATP solution, and 25 μL of NADP+ solution.
4. Mix the contents thoroughly by vortexing.
C. Enzymatic Reaction
1. Incubate the reaction mixture at 37°C for 30 minutes.
2. Add 50 μL of enzyme mix to the reaction mixture.
3. Vortex the mixture and incubate again at 37°C for another 15
minutes.
D. Measurement of Absorbance
1. Measure the absorbance of the reaction mixture at 340 nm
using a spectrophotometer.
2. Record the absorbance value and subtract the blank (lysis
buffer with reagents but without plasma).
E. Calculation of Galactokinase Activity
1. Calculate the galactokinase activity using the following formula:
( \text{Galactokinase Activity (U/L)} = \frac{\Delta A_{340}}
{\text{incubation time (min)}} \times \text{volume correction
factor} )
Where ΔA340 is the change in absorbance at 340 nm.
2. Convert the activity to U/L of plasma based on the sample
volume used in the assay.
3. QUALITY CONTROL
• Analyze control samples (both positive and negative controls)
alongside patient samples to ensure the accuracy and precision
of the assay.
• QC materials should be prepared and stored following the
manufacturer’s instructions and included in each batch of testing.
• Document all QC results and take corrective action if the controls
are out of range.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Record the results in the laboratory information system (LIS).
• Compare the observed values to the reference range:
◦ Reference Range: 3.0 - 6.0 U/L
• Ensure that results are reviewed and verified by a designated
technologist before being released.
1. CRITICAL VALUES AND REPORTING
• If the galactokinase activity is below 1.0 U/L, it is considered
critical. Repeat the test to confirm the result.
• Report confirmed critical results to the attending clinician
immediately and document the communication.
1. LIMITATIONS
• Hemolyzed samples can interfere with the spectrophotometric
reading and should be avoided.
• Ensure all reagents are fresh and properly stored to avoid
degradation that could affect the assay outcome.
1. REFERENCES
• Instruction manual and product inserts for the galactokinase
assay reagents.
• Relevant clinical guidelines and literature on galactokinase
deficiency.
This SOP ensures that the process of analyzing and reporting
galactokinase activity in blood samples is consistent, accurate, and
reliable. All personnel must adhere strictly to this procedure to
maintain the integrity of test results.
