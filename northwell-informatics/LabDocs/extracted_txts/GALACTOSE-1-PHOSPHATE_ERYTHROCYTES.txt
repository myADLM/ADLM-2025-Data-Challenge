Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Galactose-1-Phosphate, Erythrocytes
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for the analysis of Galactose-1-Phosphate in
erythrocytes, ensuring accurate and consistent results in the
laboratory.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of designated staff to perform the analytical
procedures according to this SOP. Supervisors are responsible for
ensuring compliance and addressing any issues that arise during the
process.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen Type:
• Whole blood collected in EDTA tubes.
Specimen Handling:
• Specimens should be kept refrigerated at 2-8°C and analyzed
within 72 hours of collection.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed blood samples.
• Specimens that have not been refrigerated or exceed the 72-hour
stability period.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Centrifuge
• Hemolysis tubes (e.g., microcentrifuge tubes)
• Spectrophotometer or relevant analytical instrumentation
• Water bath or heating block with temperature control
• Pipettes and tips
Reagents:
• Assay kit for Galactose-1-Phosphate (follow manufacturer’s
instructions)
• Calibration standards and controls specific to Galactose-1-
Phosphate analysis
5. QUALITY CONTROL
Quality control materials (2 levels: high and low) must be analyzed
with each batch of patient samples. Results should fall within pre-
defined acceptable ranges. Any deviations must be addressed by
repeating the analysis or troubleshooting per the manufacturer's
instructions.
6. PROCEDURE
Sample Preparation:
1. Hemolysate Preparation:
◦ Centrifuge the whole blood sample at 1,500-2,000g for 10
minutes.
◦ Discard the plasma layer and wash the erythrocytes twice
with cold isotonic saline solution.
◦ Lyse the erythrocytes by adding an appropriate volume of
distilled water and freezing at -20°C or using a hemolysis
buffer as per the assay kit instructions.
◦ Thaw the lysate if frozen and spin down any cellular debris
at 10,000g for 5 minutes.
Analysis: 2. Assay Procedure: - Prepare assay reagents and
calibrators as instructed by the kit manufacturer. - Pipette required
volumes of standards, controls, and samples into the designated
wells or cuvettes. - Add assay reagents according to specific timing
and temperature conditions outlined in the assay protocol (typically
involving incubation steps at 37°C). - Follow the spectrophotometric
reading instructions provided in the kit manual.
Data Recording: 3. Result Calculation:
• Using a spectrophotometer, measure the absorbance of each
sample and control at the specified wavelength.
• Calculate the Galactose-1-Phosphate concentration in each
sample by comparing the absorbance of the samples against the
calibration curve.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
Results are entered into the Laboratory Information System (LIS) and
reviewed by a technologist. Critical values should be double-checked
and reported promptly following laboratory procedures.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Any limitations specified in the assay kit insert should be reviewed.
Common limitations include interference by hemoglobin or other
substances in the blood that could affect the spectrophotometric
readings.
