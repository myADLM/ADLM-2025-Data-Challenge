Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) GALACTOSE-1-PHOSPHATE
URIDYLTRANSFERASE BIOCHEMICAL PHENOTYPING,
ERYTHROCYTES
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to define the procedures for performing
GALACTOSE-1-PHOSPHATE URIDYLTRANSFERASE (GALT)
biochemical phenotyping in erythrocytes, including the preparation,
analysis, and generation of results.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of qualified personnel in the laboratory to
perform and document all aspects of the GALT biochemical
phenotyping procedure according to this SOP. Personnel must be
trained and proficient in the technical aspects of the assay and
familiar with all safety protocols.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen type: Whole blood collected in EDTA tubes.
• Minimum volume: 3 mL
• Specimen stability: Refrigerate blood samples. Specimens are
stable for up to 7 days at 4°C.
• Unacceptable specimens: Hemolyzed samples, samples collected
in tubes other than EDTA, or specimens received beyond the
stability period.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• High-speed refrigerated centrifuge
• Spectrophotometer
• Hemolysis buffer: Tris-HCl, pH 7.4
• NADP (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate)
• Epimerase enzyme
• Reagent kits for GALT activity measurement
• Calibration standards
1. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation of Erythrocyte Lysates: i) Centrifuge the whole blood
samples at 1500 x g for 10 minutes at 4°C to separate the plasma
and erythrocytes. ii) Carefully remove and discard the plasma,
resuspend the erythrocytes in hemolysis buffer at a ratio of 1:1 (v/v),
and repeat centrifugation. iii) Discard the supernatant, resuspend the
packed erythrocytes in hemolysis buffer to lyse the red cells, creating
a lysate.
B) Measurement of GALT Activity: i) Prepare a reaction mixture with
NADP, epimerase, and the lysate in designated test tubes. ii)
Incubate the reaction mixture at 37°C for 30 minutes. iii) Measure the
absorbance at specific wavelengths using a spectrophotometer.
Record the absorbance readings.
C) Data Analysis: i) Calculate the GALT activity using the formula
provided in the reagent kit manual. ii) Compare the results against
the calibration standards to determine the enzyme activity levels. iii)
Ensure that all results are documented accurately, including any
corrective actions taken.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
A) Internal Quality Control: i) Run control samples with known GALT
activity levels alongside patient samples. ii) Ensure controls fall within
established ranges. If controls are out of range, troubleshoot the
assay before proceeding with patient samples.
B) Instrument Maintenance and Calibration: i) Regularly calibrate the
spectrophotometer according to manufacturer’s instructions. ii)
Document calibration results and any maintenance performed.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
A) Review and Verification: i) Technologist must review all data for
accuracy and completeness. ii) Verify results according to site-
specific reporting guidelines.
B) Result Interpretation: i) Negative: Normal GALT activity ii) Positive:
Deficient GALT activity indicating Galactosemia
C) Documentation: i) Report results in the laboratory information
system (LIS). ii) Include any notes on specimen condition or assay
performance.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
The reference intervals for GALT activity will be provided by the
reagent kit and validated according to laboratory standards.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the reagent kit insert for specific limitations regarding
reagent stability, sample handling, and potential interferences.
1. SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS
A) Handle all biological specimens as potentially infectious. B) Follow
laboratory safety protocols for chemical handling and instrument
operation. C) Use personal protective equipment (PPE) as required.
