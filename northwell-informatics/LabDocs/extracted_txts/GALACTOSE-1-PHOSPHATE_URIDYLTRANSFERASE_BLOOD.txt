Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Galactose-1-Phosphate Uridyltransferase (GALT) Assay in Blood
1. PURPOSE
This protocol outlines the procedure for measuring the activity of
Galactose-1-Phosphate Uridyltransferase (GALT) in blood samples
within a CLIA-certified laboratory. This assay is used for the diagnosis
of classic galactosemia.
2. SCOPE
This procedure includes the steps required for performing the GALT
assay, including specimen handling, equipment, reagents, controls,
detailed analytical procedure, and result reporting.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for carrying out the
measurements, documenting results, and ensuring that all steps are
completed according to this protocol. Supervisors are responsible for
training staff, monitoring compliance, and addressing any issues that
arise.
4. SPECIMEN
Acceptable Specimen: Whole blood collected in EDTA (lavender-
top) tubes. Samples should be kept refrigerated at 2-8°C and tested
within 7 days of collection. Alternatively, dried blood spots may be
used if processed according to standardized neonatal screening
practices.
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Hemolyzed samples
• Samples left at ambient temperature for more than 24 hours
• Clotted samples
• Samples without appropriate identification or collection date/time.
5. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes and tips (calibrated)
• Reagent reservoirs
• Incubators set to 37°C
• Water bath or heating block set to 37°C
• GALT assay reagent kit
• Calibrated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) reader
or fluorescence reader
• Analytical balance
• Gloves and personal protective equipment (PPE)
6. REAGENTS
• GALT Assay Kit (containing substrate, assay buffer, enzyme
cofactors, and other necessary reagents)
• Positive and Negative Controls (stored at -20°C)
• Calibrators (provided with the assay kit)
• Deionized Water (freshly prepared)
• Quality Control Materials (commercially available)
7. ANALYTICAL PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Bring all reagents, controls, and calibrators to room
temperature before use.
2. Calibrate pipettes and ensure all equipment is operational.
3. Label samples, controls, and blank wells on the assay plate.
Assay Procedure:
1. Sample Preparation: a. Centrifuge blood samples at 2000 x g
for 10 minutes to obtain plasma. b. Aliquot 100 µL of plasma
into corresponding wells of the microplate.
2. Reagent Preparation: a. Prepare the reaction mixture
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. b. Make sure to
include blanks, controls, and calibrators.
3. Initial Setup: a. Add 100 µL of the prepared reaction mixture to
each well containing the sample or control. b. Gently tap the
plate to mix the contents.
4. Incubation: a. Incubate the plate at 37°C for 60 minutes to
allow the enzymatic reaction to proceed.
5. Detection: a. After incubation, measure the absorbance or
fluorescence as specified by the assay kit, using an ELISA
reader or fluorescence reader at the corresponding wavelength.
b. Ensure that all readings are taken within the specified time
frame to avoid inconsistencies.
8. QUALITY CONTROL:
1. Controls: a. Run positive and negative controls with each
batch of samples to ensure assay performance. b. If controls do
not fall within the specified ranges, the assay run must be
repeated.
2. Reagent Integrity: a. Follow manufacturer instructions for
reagent storage and stability. b. Check expiration dates before
use. Do not use expired reagents.
3. Calibration Verification: a. Regularly verify assay calibration
using provided calibrators. b. Document calibration results in a
logbook.
9. RESULT REPORTING:
1. Data Analysis: a. Calculate enzyme activity in units based on
standard curves generated from the calibrators. b. Compare
patient sample results to reference ranges provided by the
assay manufacturer.
2. Reporting: a. Enter results into the Laboratory Information
System (LIS). b. Review results for accuracy and verify before
final submission. c. Notify the responsible clinician of any
critical values immediately according to laboratory policy.
10. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
Refer to the GALT assay kit instructions for detailed information on
limitations, including possible interferences.
