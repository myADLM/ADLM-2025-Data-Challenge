Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical
Phase of Generating Results for GALACTOSE-
ALPHA-1,3-GALACTOSE (ALPHA-GAL), IGE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
To establish a detailed procedure for the analytical phase of
measuring Galactose-alpha-1,3-galactose (Alpha-Gal) specific
immunoglobulin E (IgE) in serum specimens utilizing the specified
immunoassay method. This SOP ensures accurate, consistent, and
reliable assay performance from receipt of the accessioned specimen
to result reporting.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
Qualified laboratory personnel are responsible for the analytical
testing of serum samples for Alpha-Gal IgE. They must follow this
SOP, perform quality control procedures, and document all activities
accurately. Senior laboratory staff and supervisors are responsible for
training, monitoring adherence to the procedure, and addressing any
issues that arise during the analytical phase.
3. EQUIPMENT, MATERIALS, AND REAGENTS
• Immunoassay analyzer capable of detecting specific IgE
antibodies.
• Manufacturer-specified reagent kits for Alpha-Gal IgE.
• Calibrators and controls provided by the reagent manufacturer.
• Personal protective equipment (PPE), including lab coats, gloves,
and safety goggles.
• Micropipettes and sterile pipette tips.
• Centrifuge (if required for sample preparation).
• Sample tubes and racks.
• Laboratory information system (LIS) for result entry and
verification.
4. SPECIMEN
Specimen Requirements:
• Preferred/acceptable: Serum from clotted peripheral blood
specimens.
• Collect blood in a serum separator tube (SST) or plain red-top
tube.
• Allow blood to clot at room temperature, then centrifuge for 10-15
minutes at 1500-2000 x g to obtain serum.
• Store serum at 2-8°C if testing within 72 hours. For longer
storage, freeze at -20°C or colder.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Samples with gross hemolysis or lipemia.
• Specimens collected in EDTA, heparin, or citrate tubes.
• Serum samples stored or handled improperly before arrival at the
laboratory.
5. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation:
1. Receive and verify the accession of the specimen.
2. Inspect the serum for acceptability based on the criteria
mentioned above.
B. Assay Setup:
1. Power on and set up the immunoassay analyzer according to
the manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Ensure that all reagents, controls, and calibrators are within
their expiration dates and stored correctly.
3. Allow all reagents and samples to come to room temperature
before use.
4. Load calibrators and quality controls onto the analyzer as per
the manufacturer’s instructions.
C. Sample Preparation:
1. Label the sample tubes and pipette tips appropriately.
2. Pipette the serum sample into the designated sample cups or
directly onto the reaction wells as instructed by the assay
manufacturer.
3. Verify sample identification in the analyzer software to match
accession information.
D. Running the Assay:
1. Start the assay run per the instrument's standard operating
procedures.
2. Monitor the assay progression and check for any instrument
alerts or errors during the procedure.
3. Once the assay is complete, review the calibration curve and
QC results. Ensure they fall within acceptable ranges before
proceeding to report patient results.
E. Troubleshooting:
1. If calibration or control results fall outside acceptable ranges,
recalibrate the assay or rerun controls.
2. If sample results fall outside expected ranges, repeat the assay
from sample preparation.
3. Document any troubleshooting actions taken in the laboratory
log.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run quality controls with each assay as instructed by the reagent
manufacturer to ensure assay accuracy.
• Record all QC results and actions taken if controls are out of
range.
• Regularly review QC records according to laboratory quality
management protocols.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
• Once QC is accepted, review patient results for accuracy and
clinical relevance.
• Input results into the LIS and verify.
• Report results to the ordering physician following laboratory
protocols.
8. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Reference intervals or cut-off values for Alpha-Gal IgE should be
derived from the package insert or instrument-specific guidelines.
9. DOCUMENTATION
Maintain records of assay runs, including specimen accession
numbers, control results, calibration curve performance, and any
deviations or issues that arose during the assay.
10. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the manufacturer’s instructions for detailed information on
the assay’s analytical sensitivity, specificity, and limitations.
