GALACTOSE-ALPHA-1,3-GALACTOSE (ALPHA-GAL) MAMMALIAN
MEAT ALLERGY PROFILE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
The Galactose-alpha-1,3-galactose (alpha-gal) Mammalian Meat
Allergy Profile, Serum test is designed to detect specific IgE
antibodies to alpha-gal. This test is aimed at diagnosing red meat
allergy, which may present with delayed anaphylaxis, urticaria, and
gastrointestinal symptoms following consumption of mammalian
meat. This SOP outlines the procedure for analyzing serum
specimens to ensure accurate and reliable results.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing and
documenting the analytical procedures as described herein. It is the
responsibility of all designated staff to identify any anomalies that
may affect the laboratory test results and report them to a supervisor
promptly.
1. SPECIMENS
2.1 Acceptable Specimens: - Serum collected in a plain red-top tube
or a serum separator tube (SST). - Minimum volume: 0.5 mL of
serum. - Specimens should be centrifuged and separated from cells
within 2 hours of collection. - Specimens can be stored at 2-8°C for
up to 7 days. For longer storage, freeze at -20°C or lower.
2.2 Unacceptable Specimens: - Specimens received in EDTA or
heparinized tubes. - Specimens with visible hemolysis or lipemia. -
Specimens stored at room temperature for more than 7 days. -
Specimens without proper labeling or collection date/time.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
3.1 Equipment: - Automated immunoassay analyzer (e.g.,
ImmunoCAP, Phadia, or equivalent). - Centrifuge - Refrigerator
(2-8°C) - Freezer (-20°C or lower) - Pipettes and associated tips -
Calibrated thermometers
3.2 Reagents: - Alpha-gal specific IgE reagent kits (validated for use
on the analyzer). - Quality control materials: Negative and positive
control sera. - Calibrators as provided by the reagent kit
manufacturer.
3.3 Supplies: - Red-top or serum separator tubes (SST) - Labels and
lab marker - Sample cups - Logbooks and bench sheets
1. PROCEDURE
4.1 Preparation: - All reagents must be brought to room temperature
before use. - Ensure that all equipment is calibrated and functioning
according to manufacturer’s specifications. - Confirm that control
materials and calibrators are within their expiration date.
4.2 Sample Analysis: - Load serum specimens, calibrators, and
controls onto the analyzer as per the manufacturer’s instructions. -
Program the analyzer to run the test for alpha-gal specific IgE. -
Ensure that the proper assay parameters, including incubation times,
temperatures, and reading wavelengths, are set. - Perform a quality
control check by running the relevant control materials. Confirm that
control results fall within the acceptable range before proceeding with
patient samples. - Analyze patient specimens following the
established protocol.
4.3 Result Interpretation: - Review the printed results for patient
specimens. - Compare the patient's alpha-gal specific IgE levels
against the reference intervals provided in the reagent kit insert. -
Reference range for alpha-Gal IgE: Negative (<0.10 kU/L) - Clinical
interpretation should consider the specific IgE level against patient
history and clinical symptoms.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
5.1 Quality Control: - Run controls with each batch of patient
specimens. - Use two levels of controls: one at a low and one at a
high specific IgE concentration. - Record control results in the quality
control logbook. If controls are outside the established range,
investigate and resolve issues before proceeding with patient
samples.
5.2 Preventive Maintenance: - Perform daily, weekly, and monthly
maintenance of equipment as per the manufacturer's instructions. -
Document all maintenance activities in the equipment maintenance
logbook.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
6.1 Transferring Results: - Results for alpha-gal IgE testing should be
automatically transmitted to the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
from the analyzer. - Validate results within the LIS and ensure those
flagged critical or anomalous results are reviewed before finalizing.
6.2 Result Documentation: - Include the specific IgE levels and
interpretive comments in the final report. - Provide a comprehensive
report with reference intervals and clinical context for physicians to
interpret.
