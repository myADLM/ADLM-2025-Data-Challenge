SOP: Analytical Phase for Generating Results for Galactosemia,
GALT Gene, Full Gene Analysis
1. PURPOSE
To outline the standard procedure for the detection and analysis of
the GALT gene mutations associated with galactosemia using full
gene analysis techniques in a CLIA-certified laboratory.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of all laboratory technologists to follow this
protocol carefully and ensure accurate results. The laboratory
supervisor is responsible for ensuring this SOP is followed and for
addressing any discrepancies or issues that arise.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND PREPARATION
2.1 Preferred Specimen:
• 5-10 mL of peripheral blood collected in an EDTA (lavender top)
tube.
• Blood should be processed within 72 hours of collection.
2.2 Unacceptable Specimen:
• Specimens that are hemolyzed, clotted, or improperly labeled.
• Blood samples collected in non-EDTA tubes.
1. PROCEDURE
3.1 DNA Extraction:
• Perform DNA extraction from collected blood samples using a
validated commercial DNA extraction kit following the
manufacturer's protocol.
• Quantify the extracted DNA using a spectrophotometer and
assess purity (A260/A280 ratio).
3.2 PCR Amplification:
• Utilize the extracted genomic DNA for PCR amplification of the
GALT gene encompassing all exons and relevant intronic regions.
• Prepare the PCR master mix including DNA polymerase, dNTPs,
primers specific to GALT gene regions, buffer, and MgCl2.
3.3 Amplification Conditions:
• Initial denaturation: 95°C for 5 minutes.
• Denaturation: 95°C for 30 seconds.
• Annealing: 55-60°C (depending on primer Tm) for 30 seconds.
• Extension: 72°C for 1 minute.
• Final extension: 72°C for 10 minutes.
• Total cycles: 35.
3.4 PCR Product Verification:
• Run PCR products on a 1.5% agarose gel with appropriate
molecular weight markers.
• Visualize bands under UV illumination following ethidium bromide
or an alternative DNA dye staining.
3.5 Sanger Sequencing/Next Generation Sequencing (NGS):
• Purify the amplified PCR products using a PCR purification kit.
• For Sanger sequencing: Send purified products for bidirectional
sequencing.
• For NGS: Prepare a NGS library using the appropriate kit,
quantitate and qualitatively assess the library, and sequence
using a validated NGS platform.
3.6 Data Analysis:
• Analyze Sanger sequencing results with sequencing analysis
software.
• For NGS, process raw sequencing data through the
bioinformatics pipeline to identify variants in the GALT gene.
• Compare detected variants against the reference sequence
(NCBI RefSeq) and variant databases (e.g., ClinVar, dbSNP).
1. INTERPRETATION & RESULT REPORTING
4.1 Interpretation:
• Classify variants based on ACMG guidelines into pathogenic,
likely pathogenic, benign, likely benign, or variants of uncertain
significance (VUS).
• Consider patient and family history, and previous related findings
for comprehensive interpretation.
4.2 Reporting:
• Compile a comprehensive report based on the gene analysis
findings.
• Include details on the detected variants, their clinical significance,
and recommended follow-up if necessary.
• Ensure the report is reviewed and signed off by a qualified clinical
molecular geneticist before being released.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
5.1 Internal Controls:
• Include positive and negative controls in each PCR and
sequencing batch to ensure reaction specificity and accuracy.
• Utilize proficiency testing and participating in external quality
assessment schemes.
5.2 Troubleshooting:
• If results are inconclusive or quality metrics are not met, re-
evaluate and repeat the DNA extraction, PCR amplification, and
sequencing processes.
• Record and address any deviations or issues that arise during the
analytical phase.
1. DOCUMENTATION
6.1 Maintain comprehensive records of each step including:
• Specimen collection details.
• DNA extraction, PCR conditions, gel electrophoresis images.
• Sequencing data and bioinformatics analysis results.
• Final interpretation and report.
6.2 Ensure all logs and reports are stored securely and follow
laboratory archiving policies.
