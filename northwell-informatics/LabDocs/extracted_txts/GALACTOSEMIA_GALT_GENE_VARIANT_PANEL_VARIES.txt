Standard Operating Procedure Laboratory Test: Galactosemia, GALT
Gene, Variant Panel, Varies
1. PURPOSE To ensure accurate and reliable analysis of the
GALT gene for the diagnosis of galactosemia. The variant panel
test detects specific variants within the GALT gene to
characterize suspected cases of galactosemia.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory staff to conduct the analysis,
review quality control (QC) results, and report patient results. It is the
responsibility of the laboratory supervisor to ensure adherence to all
testing procedures.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Acceptable Specimen Types:
• Whole blood (EDTA or ACD tubes)
• Buccal swabs
• Dried blood spots
Specimen Collection and Handling:
• Collect whole blood using standard venipuncture techniques and
transfer to an EDTA (lavender top) or ACD (yellow top) tube.
Invert the tube gently several times to mix the anticoagulant
thoroughly.
• Buccal swabs should be collected using sterile, DNA-free swabs,
ensuring that sufficient cellular material is acquired.
• Dry blood spots must be collected on specialized filter paper
following standard protocols.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• DNA extraction kits (validated for the type of specimen)
• Real-time PCR instrument
• GALT variant-specific probes and primers
• Nuclease-free water
• PCR master mix
• Microcentrifuge tubes
• Pipettes and tips
• Sterile gloves and laboratory coat
1. PROCEDURE
A) DNA Extraction
1. Extract DNA from whole blood, buccal swabs, or dried blood
spots using a commercially available DNA extraction kit. Follow
the manufacturer's instructions meticulously.
2. Quantify and assess the quality of extracted DNA using a
nanodrop spectrophotometer.
3. Store DNA at -20°C until further use.
B) PCR Amplification and Detection
1. Prepare the PCR master mix as follows: a. Combine the
following in a PCR tube: PCR master mix, variant-specific
primers and probes, DNA template, and nuclease-free water to
the final volume. b. Thoroughly mix the reagents without
creating bubbles.
2. Load the prepared reaction mix into the designated wells of a
real-time PCR plate.
3. Cover the plate with optical adhesive film and centrifuge briefly
to ensure all liquid is at the bottom of the wells.
4. Set up the real-time PCR instrument according to the
appropriate parameters for the GALT variant panel. Ensure the
thermal cycling conditions (denaturation, annealing, extension)
conform to recommended values.
C) Data Analysis
1. At the completion of amplification, review the generated PCR
data.
2. Evaluate the amplification plots and determine the presence or
absence of specific variants using the software associated with
the real-time PCR instrument.
3. Confirm any ambiguous results by repeating the PCR process.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
Internal Quality Control:
1. Include positive and negative controls in each PCR run to
ensure proper amplification and to detect contamination.
2. If controls do not perform as expected, do not report patient
results and investigate the cause of the failure.
Inter-laboratory Comparisons:
1. Participate in external proficiency testing programs at intervals
stipulated by the accrediting body to ensure test accuracy and
reliability.
2. REPORTING RESULTS
3. Document and review all data before reporting.
4. Report results in accordance with site-specific protocols.
Ensure that results are interpreted by a qualified molecular
geneticist.
5. Notify the referring physician of any critical findings or
uncommon variants that may influence patient management.
6. Store test results and raw data securely according to laboratory
documentation requirements.
7. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Normal: Presence of known wild-type alleles (no pathogenic variants
identified). Heterozygous: One wild-type allele and one pathogenic
variant identified. Homozygous/Compound Heterozygous: Two
pathogenic variants identified.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Sensitivity and specificity depend on the quality of DNA extracted
and the efficiency of the amplification process.
• Only the specific variants targeted by the probes will be detected.
Other variants not included in the panel will not be identified.
