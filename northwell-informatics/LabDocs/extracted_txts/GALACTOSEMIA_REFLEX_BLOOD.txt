Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase Protocol for GALACTOSEMIA REFLEX,
BLOOD
1. PURPOSE
To provide guidance for the analysis and reporting of
GALACTOSEMIA REFLEX, BLOOD test results in order to ensure
accurate and timely delivery of laboratory results.
Responsibility: All designated staff members are responsible for
performing and documenting each step of the procedure. It is the
responsibility of the laboratory supervisor to verify that tests are
conducted in accordance with the established SOP and adhere to
quality standards.
1. SPECIMEN
2.1 Specimen Requirements: - Preferred: Whole blood collected in an
EDTA tube (lavender top). - Minimum volume: 1 mL - Transport and
store the specimen at 2-8°C if the delay between collection and
analysis exceeds 24 hours. Otherwise, keep at room temperature
and process within 24 hours.
2.2 Unacceptable Specimen: - Specimen not labeled properly. -
Specimen received in incorrect anticoagulant (e.g., heparin, citrate). -
Hemolyzed or clotted samples. - Samples stored at room
temperature for over 24 hours.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
3.1 Equipment: - Automated enzyme assay analyzer - Pipettes -
Incubator (37°C) - Microcentrifuge
3.2 Reagents: - Galactose reagent kits (store according to
manufacturer's instructions) - Water and alcohol for reagent
preparation and dilution - Quality control material (positive and
negative controls)
3.3 Supplies: - EDTA tubes (lavender top) - Disposable gloves, lab
coat, face shield - Micropipette tips - Test tubes
1. PROCEDURE
4.1 Preparation: 1. Don appropriate personal protective equipment. 2.
Gather all necessary supplies and reagents. Verify that all reagents
are within expiry date.
4.2 Quality Control: 1. Run a set of quality control materials (both
levels: positive and negative) with each batch of patient samples
using the galactose reagent kit. 2. Document the results on the
Quality Control Log. 3. If quality control results are outside
acceptable ranges, do not proceed with patient samples until the
issue is resolved.
4.3 Sample Preparation: 1. Mix the whole blood specimen gently by
inversion. Avoid creating bubbles. 2. Aliquot 50 μL of the whole blood
into labeled microcentrifuge tubes.
4.4 Enzymatic Assay for Galactose-1-Phosphate Uridyltransferase
(GALT) Activity: 1. Add 450 μL of the prepared galactose reaction
mixture to each tube containing the aliquoted blood sample. 2. Vortex
the tubes to ensure proper mixing. 3. Incubate the tubes at 37°C for
30 minutes. 4. Stop the reaction by placing tubes on ice for 5
minutes. 5. Centrifuge at 10,000 RPM for 5 minutes to pelletize cells.
6. Transfer the supernatant to clean, labeled microcentrifuge tubes
for analysis.
4.5 Analysis: 1. Measure the absorbance of each sample, control,
and blank at the appropriate wavelength using an automated enzyme
assay analyzer. 2. Calculate the galactose activity using the
manufacturer’s protocol for the reagent kit. 3. Compare the patient's
enzyme activities against reference ranges.
4.6 Reflex Testing: - If the GALT activity indicates galactosemia
(based on established thresholds), reflex to confirmatory DNA testing
for known GALT gene mutations.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
5.1 Interpretation: - Reference intervals vary according to age and
are to be set as per laboratory guidelines based on the assay
specifications.
5.2 Documentation and Verification: - Enter results into the
Laboratory Information System (LIS). - Review the results to ensure
no transcription errors. - Verify the results by a qualified laboratory
technologist or pathologist before releasing them to the clinician.
5.3 Critical Values: - Immediately inform the referring physician
through the established communication channel of any critical values
as per the Critical Results Policy.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the galactose reagent kit manufacturer's insert for the
limitations of the procedure and potential interferences.
