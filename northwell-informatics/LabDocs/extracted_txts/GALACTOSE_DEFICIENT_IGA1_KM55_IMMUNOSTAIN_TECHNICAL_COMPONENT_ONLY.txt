STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP) Laboratory: [Name
of Laboratory] Department: Immunology Procedure Title: Analytical
Phase of Generating Results for Galactose Deficient IgA1 (KM55)
Immunostain, Technical Component Only Effective Date: [Date]
Approved by: [Name, Title] Revision Number: [Revision Number, if
applicable]
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the procedure for the technical steps involved in
the immunohistochemical staining and analysis of Galactose
Deficient IgA1 (KM55) on patient specimens. The results generated
will only cover the technical component; interpretation is performed
separately by a qualified pathologist.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all qualified laboratory personnel
responsible for the processing of immunohistochemical stains.
3. RESPONSIBILITIES
• Qualified laboratory personnel are responsible for carrying out the
staining procedure.
• Laboratory supervisors are responsible for ensuring compliance
with the SOP and addressing any issues that arise during the
staining process.
4. DEFINITIONS
• Galactose Deficient IgA1 (KM55): A biomarker used to identify IgA
nephropathy.
• Immunohistochemistry (IHC): A staining process used to detect
specific antigens in tissue samples.
• Technical Component: Refers to the staining portion of the test
without interpretive reporting.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Microtome
• Water Bath
• Slide Warmer
• Xylene
• Absolute ethanol and graded alcohols (95%, 70%, 50%)
• Tris-buffered saline (TBS)
• Antigen Retrieval Solution (10mM Citrate Buffer, pH 6.0)
• Peroxidase Blocking Solution
• Primary Antibody: Anti-Galactose Deficient IgA1 (KM55) antibody
• Secondary Antibody: HRP-conjugated secondary antibody
• Substrate-Chromogen Solution (e.g., DAB)
• Hematoxylin
• Mounting Medium
• Positive and Negative Control Slides
6. PROCEDURE
Specimen Preparation:
1. Ensure that the specimen has been embedded in paraffin and
sectioned at 4 µm thickness.
2. Place sections on positively charged glass slides and air dry
overnight at room temperature or for 2 hours at 60°C on a slide
warmer.
Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
1. Deparaffinize slides in xylene for 3 changes, 5 minutes each.
2. Rehydrate slides through a series of graded alcohols (absolute
ethanol, 95%, 70%, 50%) for 2 minutes each.
3. Rinse slides in running tap water for 5 minutes.
Antigen Retrieval:
1. Place slides in a microwave-safe container filled with Antigen
Retrieval Solution (10mM Citrate Buffer, pH 6.0).
2. Heat until boiling, then maintain at sub-boiling temperature for
10 minutes.
3. Allow slides to cool in the retrieval solution for 20 minutes at
room temperature.
4. Rinse slides in TBS for 5 minutes.
Blocking Endogenous Peroxidase:
1. Incubate slides with Peroxidase Blocking Solution for 10
minutes.
2. Rinse slides in TBS for 5 minutes.
Primary Antibody Incubation:
1. Apply Anti-Galactose Deficient IgA1 (KM55) antibody to the
slides and incubate in a humid chamber for 1 hour at room
temperature.
2. Rinse slides in TBS for 5 minutes.
Secondary Antibody Incubation:
1. Apply HRP-conjugated secondary antibody and incubate in a
humid chamber for 30 minutes at room temperature.
2. Rinse slides in TBS for 5 minutes.
Chromogen Development:
1. Apply Substrate-Chromogen Solution (e.g., DAB) to the slides
and incubate for 5-10 minutes until the desired stain intensity
develops.
2. Rinse slides in running tap water for 5 minutes.
Counterstaining:
1. Counterstain slides with hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes.
2. Rinse slides in running tap water for 5 minutes.
3. Blue slides in TBS or PBS for 30 seconds.
Dehydration and Mounting:
1. Dehydrate slides through graded alcohols (70%, 95%, absolute
ethanol), 2 minutes each.
2. Clear slides in xylene for 3 changes, 5 minutes each.
3. Add mounting medium and cover slips.
Quality Control:
1. Run positive and negative control slides with each batch of
patient specimens.
2. Document the staining quality and any deviations from the
protocol.
7. REPORTING AND DOCUMENTATION
• The technical component of the result consists of the stained
slides provided to the interpreting pathologist.
• Document all steps performed, including any deviations and
corrective actions taken, in the laboratory information system
(LIS).
8. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If staining issues occur (e.g., weak signal, non-specific staining),
review and adjust antigen retrieval times, antibody concentrations
or incubation times as necessary.
• Consult with the supervisor for persistent issues.
9. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's Instructions for Primary and Secondary
Antibodies.
• Published Protocols on Immunohistochemical Staining
Techniques.
10. REVIEW AND REVISION HISTORY
• This SOP will be reviewed annually and revised as needed by the
laboratory supervisor.
By following this SOP, laboratory personnel will ensure consistent
and reliable preparation of Galactose Deficient IgA1 (KM55)
immunostains for subsequent interpretation by a pathologist.
