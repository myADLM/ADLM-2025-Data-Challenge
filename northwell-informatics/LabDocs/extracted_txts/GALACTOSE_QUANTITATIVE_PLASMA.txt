Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Quantitative
Analysis of Galactose in Plasma
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to provide a standardized method
for the quantitative determination of galactose levels in plasma
samples. This SOP ensures consistent and accurate test outcomes
through the use of defined methodologies and quality control
measures.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
All trained laboratory personnel are responsible for adhering to this
SOP when performing quantitative galactose assays.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred Specimen:
• 3-5 mL of plasma collected in an EDTA (lavender-top) tube.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Plasma samples collected in incorrect anticoagulant tubes.
• Plasma samples that have been hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric.
• Samples received without proper identification or beyond the
viability window.
Specimen Handling:
• Plasma samples should be separated from cells within 2 hours of
collection.
• Plasma should be stored refrigerated (2-8°C) prior to analysis and
is stable for up to 48 hours. For longer storage, freeze at -20°C or
lower.
4. REAGENTS, EQUIPMENT, AND SUPPLIES
Reagents:
• Galactose reagent kits as recommended by the manufacturer.
• Controls and calibrators specifically designed for galactose assay.
• Deionized water.
Equipment:
• Centrifuge.
• Pipettes and pipette tips.
• Spectrophotometer or appropriate analytical instrument for
quantitative measurement.
• Vortex mixer.
Supplies:
• EDTA tubes.
• Disposable gloves.
• Sample cups.
• Standards and control materials.
5. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation:
1. Ensure all reagents and specimens are at appropriate
temperatures as stated by the reagent kit manufacturer.
2. Prepare samples, controls, and calibrators according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
3. Label sample cups clearly and accurately.
B. Assay Procedure:
1. Add a specified volume (e.g., 20 µL) of the plasma sample into
the sample cup.
2. Add the required volume of galactose reagent to the sample.
3. Mix thoroughly using a vortex mixer.
4. Incubate the mixture according to the time and temperature
specified in the reagent kit instructions.
5. Measure the absorbance at the specified wavelength using the
spectrophotometer.
6. Record the data.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Run quality control samples with each batch of assays.
2. Use at least two levels of controls (Low and High) daily to
ensure the accuracy and reliability of the assay.
3. Inspect control results against acceptable control ranges before
reporting patient results. If controls are out of range, do not
report patient results until the issue is resolved.
7. CALIBRATION
1. Calibrate the instrument according to the manufacturer’s
instructions before running assays.
2. Use certified calibration standards specific for galactose.
3. Document calibration dates and times. Recalibrate if any
significant deviations are noted.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Validate and verify results obtained from the spectrophotometer.
2. Calculate the galactose concentration by comparing the sample
absorbance to the absorbance of known standards.
3. Record and enter results into the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
4. Any critical values should be repeated and confirmed. If
confirmed, follow laboratory protocol for reporting critical results
to the appropriate healthcare provider promptly.
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the reagent kit product insert for specific limitations of the
galactose assay. Any discrepancies or issues encountered during the
assay procedure should be documented and addressed according to
the laboratory's established troubleshooting guidelines.
