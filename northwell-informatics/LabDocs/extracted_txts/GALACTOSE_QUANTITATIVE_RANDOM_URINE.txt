Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Quantitative
Galactose Measurement in Random Urine Samples
1. Purpose
To provide a clear, step-by-step procedure for the quantitative
measurement of galactose in random urine samples, ensuring
consistent and reliable results.
2. Specimen Requirements
• Preferred Specimen: Freshly voided random urine sample.
• Volume: A minimum of 10 mL of urine is required.
• Storage: If not analyzed immediately, the urine specimen can be
refrigerated (2-8°C) for up to 24 hours. For longer storage, freeze
at -20°C. Thaw samples completely before analysis.
3. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies
• Reagents:
◦ Galactose reagent kit (follow manufacturer's guidelines for
preparation and storage)
◦ Calibrators and controls (as provided by the reagent
manufacturer)
• Supplies:
◦ Urine collection containers
◦ Polypropylene tubes
◦ Pipettes and tips
• Equipment:
◦ Centrifuge
◦ Biochemical analyzer or spectrophotometer capable of reading
at 340 nm
◦ Vortex mixer
◦ Refrigerator (2-8°C)
◦ Freezer (-20°C)
4. Procedure
Step-by-Step Instructions for Conducting the Test:
a. Preparation:
1. Calibration:
◦ Calibrate the biochemical analyzer or spectrophotometer
according to the manufacturer's instructions using the
provided galactose standards.
2. Quality Control:
◦ Run quality control samples (both low and high controls) at
the start of each run to ensure the accuracy of the assay.
Results must fall within the acceptable range before
proceeding with patient samples.
b. Sample Preparation:
1. Mixing: Ensure urine samples are well-mixed by vortexing.
2. Centrifugation: Centrifuge the urine samples at 1500 RPM for
5 minutes to remove any particulate matter.
3. Aliquoting: Transfer the supernatant to clean, properly labeled
polypropylene tubes.
c. Analysis:
1. Pipetting:
◦ Pipette the required volume of urine sample, calibrators, and
controls into the designated wells or cuvettes for the
biochemical analyzer as per reagent kit instructions.
2. Reagent Addition:
◦ Add the appropriate volume of galactose reagent to each
well or cuvette.
3. Incubation:
◦ Incubate the mixture at the specified temperature for the
indicated time as per the manufacturer's protocol.
4. Measurement:
◦ Measure the absorbance at 340 nm using the biochemical
analyzer or spectrophotometer.
d. Calculation:
• The analyzer will automatically calculate galactose concentration
based on the standard curve created during calibration.
• Ensure that results for control samples fall within the pre-defined
acceptable range.
e. Interpretation:
• Reference intervals for urine galactose should be provided based
on established laboratory standards.
5. Reporting Results
• Validate and verify results for each sample.
• Report the results in mg/dL or mmol/L, as appropriate.
• Record any discrepancies or outliers, and consult the supervisor if
necessary.
6. Quality Control
• QC samples must be run at the beginning and end of each batch.
• Document QC results and maintain records for review. If controls
are out of range, troubleshoot and rerun samples as necessary.
7. Post-Analysis
• Dispose of all biological samples and reagents following biosafety
guidelines.
• Clean and maintain the analyzer as per the manufacturer's
instructions.
• Record and store all data appropriately, including any corrective
actions taken.
8. Reference Intervals
• Ensure reference intervals are based on patient age, sex, and
clinical context. Consult the latest clinical guidelines or the
reagent manufacturer’s recommendations.
9. Method Limitations
• High levels of hemolysis, bilirubin, and lipemia in urine samples
may interfere with the assay.
• Urine samples should not be contaminated with feces or other
substances.
