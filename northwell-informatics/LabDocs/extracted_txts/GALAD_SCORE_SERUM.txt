Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Analytical Phase Protocol for
Generating Results for GALAD SCORE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this SOP is to describe the
procedures for generating and reporting results for GALAD
SCORE, SERUM, including the steps for calculating the
GALAD score based on individual laboratory test results and
ensuring accurate and timely reporting.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory staff will perform the analytical procedures
and calculations.
• All staff must ensure they follow proper protocol for generating
and reviewing GALAD score results to ensure accurate and
validated reporting.
• Supervisors will oversee compliance with this SOP and address
any issues that arise during the analytical phase.
1. DEFINITION INGREDIENTS REQUIRED:
• Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP)
• Des-gamma-carboxy prothrombin (DCP)
• Total Bilirubin
• Gender of the patient (Male/Female)
• Age
1. PROCEDURE:
A. Prepare Specimens:
1. Ensure 5-10 mL serum specimens are collected and received
within the acceptable time frame and properly labeled.
2. Store specimens at 2-8°C if not immediately processed.
3. Once ready for analysis, bring the specimens to room
temperature.
B. Laboratory Assays:
1. Perform AFP measurement using the AFP assay kit as per
manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Perform DCP measurement using the DCP assay kit as per
manufacturer’s instructions.
3. Perform Total Bilirubin measurement using the Bilirubin assay
kit as per manufacturer’s instructions.
4. Document results for AFP, DCP, and Total Bilirubin.
C. GALAD Score Calculation:
1. Utilize the following formula to calculate the GALAD score:
GALAD Score = -10.52 + 1.65 * ln(AFP) + 0.04 * Age + 1.11 *
ln(DCP) + 0.84 * ln(Bilirubin) + 0.64 * Gender
Note: Gender is coded as 1 for male and 0 for female for
calculation purposes.
2. Use validated software or manual calculation tools for
generating the GALAD score.
3. Cross-check calculations for accuracy, ensuring correct values
and units are used.
D. Documentation and Quality Control:
1. Document all calculations, results, and any clinical data used
for GALAD score determination.
2. If any values fall outside expected ranges or discrepancies are
noted, initiate troubleshooting protocols and notify the
supervisor.
3. Perform quality control as defined, including running controls for
AFP, DCP, and Bilirubin assays to ensure accuracy of results.
4. Record quality control data and ensure it meets established
limits before accepting assay results for GALAD score
calculation.
E. Reporting Results:
1. Verify completeness and accuracy of generated GALAD score.
2. Submit results to software system interfaced with LIS.
3. Flag and review any critical values or discrepancies.
4. Report the final GALAD score in accordance with site-specific
guidelines, highlighting clinically relevant considerations.
F. Monitor and Maintenance:
1. Regularly audit calculations and reporting procedures to ensure
compliance with SOP.
2. Maintain instruments used for AFP, DCP, and bilirubin assays
as per manufacturer guidelines.
3. Calibrate instruments periodically using traceable standards.
4. REFERENCES:
• AFP assay kit manufacturer's manual.
• DCP assay kit manufacturer's manual.
• Bilirubin assay kit manufacturer's manual.
• Laboratory Information System (LIS) reporting guidelines.
• Latest literature on GALAD score computation and clinical
relevance.
1. APPENDICES:
• Appendices may include worksheets for manual calculations,
quality control logs, and troubleshooting guides.
Note: Ensure all laboratory personnel are trained and competent in
the analytical procedures and calculations required for generating
GALAD score results. Regular review and updates to this SOP are
essential for maintaining high standards of accuracy and reliability in
reporting.
