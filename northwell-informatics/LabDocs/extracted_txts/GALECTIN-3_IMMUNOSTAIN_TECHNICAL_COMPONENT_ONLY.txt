Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Galectin-3
Immunostain, Technical Component Only
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to outline the steps involved in
the technical component of performing a Galectin-3
immunostain on tissue specimens, ensuring accurate and
consistent results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
◦ Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for
performing the Galectin-3 immunostain according to this
SOP.
◦ It is the responsibility of the laboratory supervisor to ensure
all staff involved in this procedure are adequately trained
and comply with this SOP.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
◦ Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks.
◦ Unstained tissue sections mounted on positively charged
microscope slides.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
◦ Automated immunostainer (e.g., Ventana BenchMark
ULTRA)
◦ Galectin-3 primary antibody
◦ Detection system (e.g., UltraView Universal DAB Detection
Kit)
◦ Hematoxylin counterstain
◦ Xylene, Ethanol (100%, 95%, 70%)
◦ Coverslips and mounting medium
◦ Positive and negative control slides
◦ Microtome
◦ Water bath
◦ Forceps and slide racks
5. PROCEDURE
A) Section Preparation:
◦ Cut tissue sections at 4-5 microns thickness using a
microtome.
◦ Float sections on a warm water bath set at 40-45°C.
◦ Pick up sections onto positively charged slides and allow to
dry overnight at 37°C or for 1 hour at 60°C.
B) Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
◦ Place slides in xylene for 3 changes, 5 minutes each.
◦ Rehydrate through a graded series of ethanol (100%, 95%,
70%) for 5 minutes each.
◦ Rinse slides in distilled water for 5 minutes.
C) Antigen Retrieval:
◦ Follow manufacturer’s instructions for antigen retrieval using
appropriate retrieval buffer (e.g., Citrate buffer, pH 6.0) and
method (e.g., heat-induced epitope retrieval in a pressure
cooker or microwave).
D) Immunostaining:
◦ Load slides onto the automated immunostainer.
◦ Program the immunostainer with the following protocol:
▪ Apply Galectin-3 primary antibody and incubate as per
manufacturer’s recommended time and dilution.
▪ Apply detection system reagents (e.g., secondary
antibody, streptavidin-HRP) as per kit instructions.
▪ Develop slides with DAB chromogen.
▪ Counterstain with hematoxylin for 2-3 minutes.
▪ Rinse in distilled water.
▪ Dehydrate through graded ethanol (70%, 95%, 100%), 2
changes each for 2 minutes.
▪ Clear in xylene, 2 changes for 5 minutes each.
E) Mounting:
◦ Apply coverslip with mounting medium.
◦ Allow slides to dry thoroughly.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Run positive and negative control slides with each batch of
specimens.
◦ Ensure positive control slides show expected staining for
Galectin-3.
◦ Ensure negative control slides show no staining.
7. DOCUMENTATION
◦ Record all staining runs in the lab log, including date, batch
number, antibody lot number, and control results.
◦ Document any deviations from the SOP and corrective
actions taken.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ Technical staff are responsible for scanning and reviewing
stained slides to ensure quality of staining.
◦ Verified slides are handed over to pathologists for evaluation
and interpretation.
9. REFERENCES
◦ Manufacturer’s instructions for Galectin-3 primary antibody.
◦ Ventana BenchMark ULTRA user manual.
◦ Relevant histology and pathology textbooks.
By following this SOP, laboratory personnel can ensure the consistent
and accurate generation of Galectin-3 immunostain results,
contributing to reliable diagnostic outcomes.
