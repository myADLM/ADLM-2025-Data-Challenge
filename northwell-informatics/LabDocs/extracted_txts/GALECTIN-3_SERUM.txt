Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
1. PURPOSE To provide a detailed protocol for the analysis and
generation of results for Galectin-3 in serum samples. This SOP
ensures accurate and consistent results that support clinical decision-
making.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory staff are responsible for
performing Galectin-3 testing according to this procedure. It is the
responsibility of all laboratory personnel to ensure the proper
execution of the procedure and to report any issues to their
supervisor.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENT AND STABILITY
Preferred/Acceptable: 10 mL freshly collected serum, ideally within
6 hours of collection. Serum specimens should be separated from
clotted material within 2 hours of collection and stored at 2-8°C if not
immediately analyzed.
Unacceptable:
• Specimens arriving in the laboratory greater than 24 hours after
collection without being refrigerated.
• Specimens arriving without proper labeling (collection date/time
not indicated).
• Specimens that have undergone repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies:
• Galectin-3 ELISA kit or another specified assay kit.
• Microplate reader calibrated to the specific requirement of the
assay.
• Micropipettes and disposable tips.
• Tubes for sample preparation and storage.
• Calibrated centrifuge.
• Laboratory timer.
• Personal protective equipment (PPE).
3. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation and Setup
1. Kit Verification: Ensure that the Galectin-3 assay kit is within
its expiry date and includes all necessary components as listed
in the manufacturer's product insert.
2. Equipment Setup: Start and calibrate the microplate reader
according to manufacturer guidelines.
3. Sample Preparation: Centrifuge serum samples to remove any
particulate matter. Ensure the sample is clear and free from
hemolysis, lipemia, or icterus.
B) Testing Procedure
1. Reagent Preparation: Bring all reagents to room temperature
and prepare reagents according to the instructions in the
product insert.
2. Sample Loading: Load standards, controls, and patient
samples in duplicate into assigned wells into the microplate
using micropipettes.
3. Assay Execution: Follow the product insert for step-by-step
instructions for the assay procedure, including washing steps
and incubation times.
• Ensure to start the timer immediately after adding reagents to
avoid any delay.
1. Reading Results: After completing the assay, read the
microplate at the recommended wavelength using the
microplate reader.
• Ensure proper configuration and calibration of the microplate
reader before measurements.
1. Data Analysis: Obtain absorbance values from the microplate
reader and calculate Galectin-3 concentrations against the
standard curve using the provided software.
C) Quality Control
1. Validation: As per manufacturer guidelines, run quality control
samples for every new kit/reagent lot or daily to ensure assay
performance.
2. Logging: Log QC results, ensuring they fall within acceptable
ranges before proceeding with patient sample analyses.
• Document any deviations or issues arising during the testing
process.
D) Troubleshooting
1. Inconsistencies: Repeat the assays if results from standards,
controls, or duplicates are inconsistent.
2. Equipment Malfunctions: Refer to manufacturer's guidelines
for any equipment-related issues. Notify supervisor and follow
internal reporting protocols for equipment malfunction.
E) Reporting Results
1. Documentation: Record results in the laboratory information
system (LIS) for review.
2. Review: Laboratory staff must review Galectin-3 results for
validity and consistency before reporting.
3. Verification: Verified results should be transmitted to the
requesting physician or healthcare provider within the stipulated
timeframe.
Reference Intervals:
• Establish reference intervals based on the population studied and
guidelines provided by the assay manufacturer or published
literature.
Method Limitations:
• Refer to the product insert for Galectin-3 assay-specific
limitations.
• Analytical interferences such as hemolysis, lipemia, and icterus
must be evaluated and documented when detected.
References:
• Product insert for the specific Galectin-3 assay kit.
• Relevant clinical guidelines and published literature.
Review and Revision: This SOP is to be reviewed annually or upon
receipt of updated guidelines from the assay kit manufacturer. Any
revisions should be documented accordingly and communicated to
all relevant laboratory personnel.
