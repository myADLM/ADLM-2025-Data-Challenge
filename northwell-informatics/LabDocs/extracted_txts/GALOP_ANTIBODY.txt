Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase Protocol for Generating Results for GALOP
Antibody
1. PURPOSE
To establish a standardized procedure for the analysis and
generation of results for GALOP (Glycoprotein Associated with Lung
and Ovarian Pathology) Antibody. This ensures consistent, accurate,
and reliable results with adherence to all safety and quality standards
within a CLIA-certified laboratory.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all CLIA-certified laboratory personnel involved
in the analytical phase of GALOP Antibody testing.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all designated laboratory personnel to follow
this procedure, ensuring accurate testing, proper documentation, and
timely reporting of GALOP Antibody results. Supervisors must ensure
adherence to the protocol and address any deficiencies or issues that
may arise.
4. DEFINITIONS
GALOP Antibody: An immunoglobulin detected in serum samples,
indicating a potential association with lung and ovarian pathology.
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STORAGE
Specimen Type:
• Preferred: Serum collected in a red-top tube (without gel) or
serum separator tube (SST).
• Volume: Minimum 3 mL of serum.
Storage:
• Specimens should be processed and analyzed within 2 hours of
collection if at room temperature. If analysis cannot be performed
immediately, the serum should be refrigerated at 2-8°C and
analyzed within 24 hours. For longer storage, serum should be
frozen at -20°C or colder.
6. REAGENTS, EQUIPMENT, AND SUPPLIES
Reagents:
• GALOP Antibody Test Kit (manufacturer name, catalog number)
• Calibrators and controls (positive and negative) provided with the
test kit
Equipment:
• Microplate reader capable of measuring absorbance at the
wavelength specified by the manufacturer (typically 450 nm with
reference filter at 620-650 nm)
• Incubator set at 37°C
• Micropipettes and tips
• Vortex mixer
• Timer
Supplies:
• Reagent reservoirs
• Microplates
• Plate sealers
• Laboratory gloves, lab coats, and other PPE as required
7. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation
1. Allow all reagents and samples to reach room temperature
before use.
2. Prepare calibrators, controls, and serum samples according to
the manufacturer’s instructions.
3. Label microplate wells accordingly for standards, controls, and
patient samples.
B. Assay Procedure
1. Add 100 µL of each calibrator, control, and serum sample to the
designated wells.
2. Cover the microplate with a plate sealer and incubate at 37°C
for 30 minutes.
3. Wash the wells 3-5 times with the provided wash solution to
remove unbound antibodies.
4. Add 100 µL of enzyme-conjugated antibody reagent to each
well and incubate at 37°C for 30 minutes.
5. Wash the wells again 3-5 times with wash solution.
6. Add 100 µL of substrate solution to each well and incubate at
room temperature for 15 minutes, avoiding direct light.
7. Add 100 µL of stop solution to each well to terminate the
reaction.
8. Measure absorbance at 450 nm using a microplate reader (with
a reference filter at 620-650 nm).
C. Quality Control
1. Run positive and negative controls with each batch of samples.
2. Verify that control results fall within the specified range provided
by the manufacturer.
3. If control results are out of range, do not report patient results.
Investigate and resolve issues by checking reagent integrity,
protocol adherence, and instrument performance.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Determine the presence or absence of GALOP Antibody in
patient samples based on the absorbance values compared to
the calibrators.
2. Positive: Absorbance value above the cut-off defined by the
manufacturer.
3. Negative: Absorbance value below the cut-off defined by the
manufacturer.
4. Indeterminate: Absorbance value around the cut-off; repeat the
test for clarification or consider further confirmatory testing.
9. DOCUMENTATION AND RESULT VERIFICATION
1. Document all assay runs, including sample identification,
reagent lot numbers, control results, and any deviations from
the procedure.
2. Technologists must review and verify results before reporting.
Ensure that the LIS correctly captures and transmits results.
3. Any issues or uncertainties must be brought to the attention of
the supervisor for prompt resolution.
10. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the GALOP Antibody Test Kit insert for specific limitations,
including potential interferences, stability, and reliability of the assay.
