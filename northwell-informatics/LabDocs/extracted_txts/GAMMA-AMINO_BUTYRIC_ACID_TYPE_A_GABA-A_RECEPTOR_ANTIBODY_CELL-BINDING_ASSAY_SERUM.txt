Protocol for Analytical Phase of Generating Results for GAMMA-
AMINO BUTYRIC ACID TYPE A (GABA-A) RECEPTOR
ANTIBODY, CELL-BINDING ASSAY, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for the analytical phase of generating
results for the GAMMA-AMINO BUTYRIC ACID TYPE A
(GABA-A) Receptor Antibody, Cell-Binding Assay in serum
specimens.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing the
assay, ensuring all procedures are followed accurately, and
documenting results.
1. SPECIMEN
a. Preferred/Acceptable:
◦ Serum (minimum volume: 1 mL) collected in a serum
separator tube (SST) or red-top tube.
◦ Specimens must be centrifuged and serum separated within
2 hours of collection.
◦ Store serum specimens at 2-8°C for up to 48 hours, or
freeze at -20°C or lower for longer storage.
b. Unacceptable:
◦ Specimens collected in tubes containing anticoagulants
(e.g., EDTA, heparin).
◦ Specimens with visible hemolysis or lipemia.
◦ Specimens not properly labeled or without collection date/
time indicated.
◦ Specimens arriving at the laboratory more than 48 hours
after collection if refrigerated, or showing signs of potential
degradation.
2. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
◦ Cell-binding assay kit for GABA-A receptor antibody (e.g.,
commercial assay kits validated for clinical use).
◦ Incubators set to appropriate temperatures (refer to kit
instructions).
◦ Centrifuge suitable for serum separation.
◦ Pipettes (single and multi-channel) calibrated regularly.
◦ Clean glass or plastic tubes for diluting serum specimens.
◦ Timer
◦ Microplate reader compatible with the assay kit.
3. PROCEDURE a. Preparation:
◦ Ensure all reagents and kit components are brought to room
temperature before use.
◦ Verify the calibration status of equipment (e.g., incubators,
microplate readers).
b. Assay Setup:
1. Carefully read the kit insert and manufacturer guidelines.
2. Label each well of the microplate appropriately.
3. Dilute serum specimens as instructed (typically using a
buffer provided in the kit).
4. Add the specified amount of diluted serum to each well.
5. Follow the protocol for reagent addition, incubation times,
washes, and detection steps precisely as indicated by the
kit instructions.
c. Detection:
◦ Incubate the microplate under recommended conditions.
◦ Ensure washes are thorough to prevent background noise.
◦ Add detection reagents as specified.
◦ Read the microplate using the specified settings on the
microplate reader.
4. RESULT INTERPRETATION AND REPORTING: a. Quality
Control:
◦ Run positive and negative controls with each assay batch.
◦ Check that control results fall within predefined acceptable
ranges.
b. Analysis:
◦ Record optical density (OD) or fluorescence values.
◦ Calculate antibody concentrations using a standard curve if
provided by kit.
◦ Compare patient results against reference range or cutoff
values provided in the kit instructions.
c. Documentation:
◦ Document all steps and reagent lot numbers in the assay
log.
◦ Record results along with date, time, and initials of the
performing technologist.
◦ Flag any results requiring further validation (e.g. controls
falling out of range, questionable sample integrity).
5. TROUBLESHOOTING:
◦ If unexpected results are observed, check for potential
issues such as equipment malfunction, reagent expiration,
or procedural errors.
◦ Retest specimens if control results are unsatisfactory.
◦ If the issue persists, consult the kit manufacturer or senior
lab personnel for guidance.
6. REFERENCE VALUES:
◦ Refer to the specific kit insert for reference ranges or cutoff
values.
◦ Common results interpretation:
▪ Positive: Above cutoff value indicating presence of
GABA-A receptor antibodies.
▪ Negative: Below cutoff value, indicating absence of
GABA-A receptor antibodies.
7. REPORTING RESULTS:
◦ Transmit results to the LIS (Laboratory Information System).
◦ Review and verify results.
◦ Report critical values immediately to requesting physician in
accordance with laboratory policy.
8. REFERENCES:
◦ Manufacturer's kit insert for specific reagent details and
procedural guidelines.
◦ Relevant clinical guidelines and peer-reviewed articles on
cell-binding assays for GABA-A receptor antibodies.
