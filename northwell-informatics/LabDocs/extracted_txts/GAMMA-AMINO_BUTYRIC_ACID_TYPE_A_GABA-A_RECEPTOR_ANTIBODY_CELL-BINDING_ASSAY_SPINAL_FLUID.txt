Standard Operating Procedures
Analytical Phase: GAMMA-AMINO BUTYRIC ACID
TYPE A (GABA-A) RECEPTOR ANTIBODY, CELL-
BINDING ASSAY, SPINAL FLUID
1. Purpose
To outline the procedure for the detection and quantification of
Gamma-Amino Butyric Acid Type A (GABA-A) receptor antibodies in
spinal fluid using a cell-binding assay. The results generated are
critical for the diagnosis of neurological disorders, especially
autoimmune encephalitis.
2. Responsibility
It is the responsibility of designated laboratory personnel to perform
the GABA-A receptor antibody assay accurately and in a timely
manner. All personnel must adhere to this SOP to ensure consistent
and reliable results.
3. Specimen Requirements and Storage
• Specimen Type: Spinal fluid (CSF)
• Volume: Minimum of 1 mL of CSF.
• Storage: Specimens should be stored at -80°C upon receipt and
thawed completely before testing.
• Unacceptable Conditions: Specimens that are hemolyzed,
contaminated, or improperly stored will be rejected.
4. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies
• Equipment:
◦ Cell culture incubator
◦ Centrifuge
◦ Microscope
◦ Pipettes and tips
◦ Vortex mixer
• Reagents and Supplies:
◦ GABA-A receptor expressing HEK293 cells
◦ Blocking buffer (PBS with 2% fetal bovine serum)
◦ Primary antibodies (patient's CSF)
◦ Secondary antibodies (e.g., fluorophore-conjugated anti-
human IgG)
◦ Mounting medium with DAPI
5. Procedure
A. Preparation
1. Thaw the CSF specimens completely on ice.
2. Prepare HEK293 cells expressing GABA-A receptors according
to cell culture guidelines and ensure cells are at 80-100%
confluency.
3. Harvest the cells, wash with PBS, and resuspend in blocking
buffer.
4. Aliquot a fixed number of cells (e.g., 1x10^5 cells) into each
well of a 96-well plate.
B. Incubation with Primary Antibodies
1. Add 50 μL of the patient's CSF to the respective wells
containing the cells.
2. Incubate the plate at 37°C for 30 minutes with gentle shaking.
3. Wash cells thrice with PBS to remove unbound antibodies.
C. Incubation with Secondary Antibodies
1. Add 50 μL of secondary antibody solution to the wells and
incubate at 37°C for 30 minutes in the dark.
2. Wash cells thrice with PBS to remove unbound secondary
antibodies.
D. Microscopic Examination and Analysis
1. Add mounting medium with DAPI to each well to stain the
nuclei.
2. Examine the wells under a fluorescence microscope.
3. Document the number of cells showing distinct cell membrane
fluorescence.
4. Compare with negative and positive controls to determine the
presence and titer of GABA-A receptor antibodies.
6. Quality Control
• Include both positive and negative controls in each assay run.
• Record all relevant quality control data such as cell viability and
fluorescence intensity.
• Reassess quality control materials periodically in accordance with
laboratory standards.
7. Reporting Results
• Interpret and report test results as positive, negative, or
inconclusive based on the established criteria.
• Document findings accurately in the laboratory information system
(LIS) and ensure results are reviewed and verified by the
responsible technologist.
8. Reference Intervals
• Negative: No significant cell membrane fluorescence.
• Positive: Distinct cell membrane fluorescence observed in patient
wells but not in negative control wells.
9. Method Limitations
• Factors such as specimen quality, cell line consistency, and
antibody specificity can influence assay accuracy.
• Cross-reactivity and nonspecific binding may result in false
positives or negatives.
10. Documentation and Record Keeping
• Maintain detailed records of all specimens processed, including
specimen ID, processing time, assay conditions, and results.
• Ensure all equipment maintenance and calibration records are up
to date.
11. References
• Manufacturer's guidelines for HEK293 cell culture and handling.
• Relevant scientific literature on GABA-A receptor antibody
assays.
• Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines.
Conclusion
This SOP provides a standardized method for the detection of GABA-
A receptor antibodies in CSF using a cell-binding assay. Accurate
adherence to these procedures ensures reliable and reproducible
results, contributing to appropriate patient diagnosis and care.
