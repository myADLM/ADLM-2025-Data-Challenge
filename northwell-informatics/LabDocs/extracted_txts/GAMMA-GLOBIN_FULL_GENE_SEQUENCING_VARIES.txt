Standard Operating Procedure for Gamma-Globin Full Gene
Sequencing
1. PURPOSE
This protocol describes the analytical procedures and guidelines to
be followed for generating results of Gamma-Globin Full Gene
Sequencing. The sequencing is intended for the detection of
mutations, deletions, insertions, and other variations within the
gamma-globin gene.
1. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel performing gamma-
globin gene sequencing in the CLIA-certified laboratory.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the trained laboratory personnel to: a. Follow
this SOP accurately. b. Document all required information carefully. c.
Report any deviations or issues encountered during the procedure to
the supervisor. d. Maintain the confidentiality and integrity of patient
information and results.
1. EQUIPMENT, MATERIALS, AND REAGENTS
• DNA extraction kit (validated for clinical use)
• DNA quantification instrument (e.g., Qubit Fluorometer)
• Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) reagents and thermal cycler
• Gamma-Globin gene-specific primers
• Sequencing library preparation kit
• Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) platform (e.g., Illumina
MiSeq)
• Computational resources and bioinformatics software for data
analysis
• Personal protective equipment (gloves, lab coat, safety glasses)
• Micropipettes and sterile pipette tips
• DNAse/RNAse-free tubes
• Positive and negative control samples
1. PROCEDURE
5.1 DNA Extraction a. Extract genomic DNA from the patient's
provided specimen using the designated DNA extraction kit following
the manufacturer’s instructions. b. Quantify the extracted DNA using
an appropriate quantification method (e.g., Qubit Fluorometer) and
record the concentration and purity ratios (A260/A280).
5.2 PCR Amplification of Gamma-Globin Gene a. Design and
validate primers specific to the regions of interest within the gamma-
globin gene. b. Set up PCR reactions with the extracted genomic
DNA, using appropriate reagent volumes and thermal cycling
conditions. c. Include positive and negative control samples to
validate the PCR amplification.
5.3 Library Preparation for Sequencing a. Follow the sequencing
library preparation kit instructions to generate sequencing-ready
libraries from the PCR products. b. Check library quality and
concentration using a suitable method (e.g., Agilent Bioanalyzer or
TapeStation).
5.4 Next-Generation Sequencing a. Load the prepared sequencing
libraries onto the NGS platform according to the manufacturer’s
protocols. b. Monitor the sequencing run to ensure it progresses
without errors.
5.5 Data Analysis a. Transfer the raw sequencing data to the
bioinformatics team or designated computational resources. b. Use
bioinformatics pipelines to process, align, and analyze the
sequencing data against reference gamma-globin gene sequences.
c. Identify and annotate any variants detected, including single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), insertions, deletions, and any
structural variations.
5.6 Result Interpretation and Reporting a. Review the analysis
results for accuracy and potential clinical significance. b. Compare
the detected variants with known reference databases and literature.
c. Document the results in the patient’s laboratory information system
(LIS). d. Generate a comprehensive report including: i. Patient
identification information (ensuring confidentiality). ii. Methodology
and quality control information. iii. Identified variants and their
potential clinical significance. iv. Interpretive comments and
references to relevant literature.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Regularly validate and calibrate all equipment and instruments
used in the process.
• Perform internal quality control checks using positive and
negative control samples in each run.
• Participate in external proficiency testing and quality assurance
programs to ensure accuracy and reliability of results.
1. DOCUMENTATION
• Document all steps, observations, and deviations in a laboratory
notebook or an electronic laboratory information management
system (LIMS).
• Retain all records, including raw data files, analysis outputs, and
result reports, in accordance with regulatory requirements and
laboratory policies.
1. REFERENCES
• Refer to the manufacturer’s manuals for equipment and reagents.
• Follow the guidelines for clinical next-generation sequencing
provided by the College of American Pathologists (CAP) and the
Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI).
• Refer to relevant scientific literature for information on gamma-
globin gene variants and their clinical significance.
