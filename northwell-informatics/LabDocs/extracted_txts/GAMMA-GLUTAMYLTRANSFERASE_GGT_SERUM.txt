Standard Operating Procedure for Gamma-Glutamyltransferase
(GGT), Serum
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to provide a standardized method
for the determination of Gamma-Glutamyltransferase (GGT) activity
in serum samples using an automated chemistry analyzer. This
enzyme assay is commonly used as a marker for liver function and
alcohol consumption.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENT AND HANDLING
Preferred Specimen: - Serum obtained from a clot tube (red
top) or serum separator tube (SST).
Specimen Stability: - Specimen is stable for 7 days at 2-8°C. -
Specimen is stable for up to 6 months if frozen at -20°C or
lower. If the specimen is frozen for longer periods, it should be
labeled with the date and time of freezing.
Unacceptable Specimen: - Hemolyzed specimens are
unacceptable because hemolysis can interfere with the analyte
measurement. - Specimens collected in tubes containing
anticoagulants such as EDTA, citrate, heparin, and oxalate.
2. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
An automated chemistry analyzer (e.g., Roche Cobas,
Beckman AU, etc.) GGT reagent kit specific for the analyzer
being used. Calibrators and quality control materials. Pipettes
and tips.
3. PROCEDURE
1. Calibration: a. Calibrate the analyzer as per the
manufacturer's instructions using an appropriate GGT
calibrator. b. Verify the calibration curve using quality
control materials.
2. Quality Control: a. Quality control samples should be run
with each batch of specimens, each day of testing, or as
recommended by the manufacturer. b. Follow the
laboratory's quality control protocol to verify that control
results are within the established acceptable range before
proceeding with patient samples. c. Record the results
and evaluate acceptance criteria.
3. Sample Preparation: a. Allow frozen specimens to thaw at
room temperature. b. Mix gently by inversion and
centrifuge serum samples at 3000 RPM for 10 minutes to
remove particulate matter.
4. Running the Test: a. Load the serum samples, reagents,
and necessary controls onto the analyzer. b. Select the
GGT assay from the analyzer menu. c. Follow the specific
operating protocol for the analyzer being used. This
typically will include programming the sample IDs,
volumes for reagents, standards, and samples. d. Ensure
that the analyzer conditions (incubation time, temperature,
etc.) are set according to the reagent manufacturer
instructions.
5. Analytical Measurement: a. The analyzer will
automatically mix samples with the reagents and measure
the absorbance change at a specific wavelength (usually
at 405 nm). b. The analyzer calculates the GGT activity
based on the change in absorbance over time and
converts it to the appropriate units (U/L or IU/L).
4. REPORTING RESULTS
1. The automated analyzer will transmit the results to the
Laboratory Information System (LIS) for review.
2. Verify the results against quality control and calibration
data.
3. Results should be reported as U/L or IU/L, depending on
the unit system adopted by the laboratory.
4. Flag any abnormal or critical values based on the
laboratory's reference ranges and report those values to
the appropriate healthcare provider immediately.
5. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Reference ranges for GGT may vary by age, sex, and
laboratory methods. Typical ranges are provided by the reagent
manufacturer.
◦ Adult males: 10-71 U/L
◦ Adult females: 6-42 U/L
◦ Pediatrics: Reference intervals should be verified specific to
the reagent and analyzer used.
6. METHOD LIMITATIONS
1. Hemolysis may interfere with the assay, leading to
inaccurate results.
2. Icteric or lipemic samples may require manual
intervention or dilution according to the analyzer's
capability to handle such samples.
3. Certain medications and pathological conditions may
influence GGT activity.

◦ Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines for
enzyme assays.

8. MAINTENANCE OF EQUIPMENT
It is the responsibility of the laboratory personnel to regularly
maintain and calibrate the automated analyzer used for GGT
analysis as per the manufacturer's instructions to ensure the
accurate and reliable performance of the equipment.
9. DOCUMENTATION
All steps carried out from specimen preparation to result
reporting should be documented appropriately in the laboratory
records. Ensure all logs for temperature, calibrations, quality
controls, and maintenance activities are up-to-date and
reviewed periodically.
