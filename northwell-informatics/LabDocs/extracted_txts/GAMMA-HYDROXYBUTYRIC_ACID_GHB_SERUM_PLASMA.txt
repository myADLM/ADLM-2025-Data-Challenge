Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analysis of Gamma-
Hydroxybutyric Acid (GHB) in Serums/Plasma
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedures for the analysis
of Gamma-Hydroxybutyric Acid (GHB) in serum/plasma samples
within the laboratory. This will ensure the reliability and accuracy of
the analytical results, thereby supporting clinical diagnosis and
treatment.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel involved in the analysis
of GHB in serum/plasma samples.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
The laboratory personnel are responsible for:
• Adhering to the SOP when analyzing GHB in serum/plasma.
• Ensuring all equipment and reagents are in proper working
condition and not expired.
• Documenting all results and maintaining records as required.
• Reporting any irregularities with samples or instrumentation to a
supervisor promptly.
4. DEFINITIONS
Gamma-Hydroxybutyric Acid (GHB): A central nervous system
depressant commonly analyzed for investigational or clinical
diagnostic purposes.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) system
• Centrifuge
• Micropipettes and tips
• Vortex mixer
• Syringes and needles
• GHB calibration standards
• Internal standard (e.g., deuterated GHB or similar)
• Organic solvents (e.g., acetonitrile, methanol)
• Derivatization reagent (e.g., BSTFA with 1% TMCS)
• Serum/plasma sample collection tubes
6. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen: Serum or plasma collected in appropriate tubes (e.g.,
EDTA or lithium heparin tubes)
• Ensure that the samples are properly labeled with the patient's
identification and collection details.
• Specimens should be refrigerated if analysis is not performed
immediately and are stable for up to 48 hours when stored at
2-8°C.
• For longer storage, freeze specimens at -20°C and avoid
repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
7. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation
1. Calibration Curve Preparation:
◦ Prepare a calibration curve by spiking blank serum/plasma
with known concentrations of GHB standards.
◦ Include an internal standard in each calibration sample.
2. Sample Processing:
◦ Thaw serum/plasma samples to room temperature if frozen.
◦ Centrifuge samples at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes to obtain
clear supernatant.
◦ Transfer 0.5 mL of the supernatant to a clean test tube.
B) Extraction
1. Protein Precipitation:
◦ Add 1 mL of acetonitrile to the serum/plasma in the test tube
to precipitate proteins.
◦ Vortex for 1 minute.
◦ Centrifuge at 3000 rpm for another 10 minutes.
2. Transfer:
◦ Carefully transfer the clear supernatant to a new clean test
tube without disturbing the pellet.
C) Derivatization
1. Derivatization with BSTFA:
◦ Add 50 µL of BSTFA with 1% TMCS to the extracted
supernatant.
◦ Vortex for 1 minute.
◦ Incubate the sample at 70°C for 30 minutes for complete
derivatization.
D) GC-MS Analysis
1. Instrument Preparation:
◦ Set up the GC-MS system as per manufacturer's
instructions.
◦ Ensure the proper column and temperature settings are
used (e.g., DB-5MS column, initial temperature 100°C, ramp
to 280°C).
2. Injection:
◦ Inject 1 µL of the derivatized sample into the GC-MS using
an autosampler.
3. Data Acquisition:
◦ Acquire data using selective ion monitoring (SIM) mode to
detect GHB and the internal standard.
◦ Ensure the peaks for both GHB and the internal standard
are well-separated and identifiable.
E) Data Analysis
1. Quantification:
◦ Quantify GHB concentrations by comparing the sample
peak areas to the calibration curve.
◦ Apply the internal standard correction to compensate for any
variability.
2. Validation:
◦ Perform quality control checks with each batch of samples
using known QC standards.
◦ Ensure results fall within acceptable ranges before
reporting.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
• Utilize two levels of QC materials: one high and one low
concentration.
• QC materials should be processed and analyzed with each batch
of samples.
• Results must fall within pre-defined acceptable ranges.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results are transmitted to the Laboratory Information System
(LIS) and must be reviewed and verified by a technologist.
• Report any anomalous results or critical values in adherence with
laboratory policies.
10. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s guidelines for the GC-MS system.
• Relevant clinical guidelines for GHB analysis and interpretation.
11. REVIEW AND MAINTENANCE
• This SOP should be reviewed annually or when significant
changes in the methodology or instrumentation occur.
• Updates and revisions should be documented and approved by
laboratory management.
