STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE
GAMMA-HYDROXYBUTYRIC ACID (GHB), URINE
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for the extraction, analysis, and reporting
results of Gamma-Hydroxybutyric Acid (GHB) in urine specimens.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
* Acceptable Specimen:
- 10 mL of freshly voided urine collected in a clean container.
- BD Vacutainer Urinalysis Preservative Conical Urine tube containing 7-9 mL urine.
* Unacceptable Specimen:
- Specimens arriving in the laboratory more than 72 hours after collection.
- Specimens without a collection date/time indicated on the sample container or requisition.
- Urine samples diluted or contaminated with external substances.
* Note: If the urine sample has been refrigerated, bring it to room temperature prior to analysis and ensure no preservatives have interfered with the GHB assay.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
* GC-MS/MS (Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry/Mass Spectrometry) Instrument
* Analytical balance
* Pipettes
* Vials for sample preparation and analysis
* Standards and control solutions for GHB
* Derivatization reagents from vendor-approved kit
* Dedicated urine analysis workstation
* Personal protective equipment including gloves and lab coat
4. QUALITY CONTROL
* Material:
- Positive Control (high-level GHB concentration)
- Negative Control (no detectable GHB)
* Storage:
- Store quality control material at 2-8°C. Stable until the expiry date.
* Procedure:
- Run controls with each batch of samples processed.
- Document control results and compare against acceptable ranges before proceeding with analysis.
- If control results fall outside acceptable ranges, troubleshoot and rerun controls.
5. PROCEDURE
A) Sample Preparation
1. Collect 10 mL of urine in a clean container. For samples in BD Vacutainer tubes, transfer to a clean vial.
2. Vortex specimen for adequate mixing.
3. Aliquot 1 mL of urine into a clean derivatization vial.
4. Add internal standard and derivatization reagent as per vendor kit instructions.
5. Cap the vial and vortex for 1 minute.
6. Allow the sample to react at room temperature for the specified time indicated in the vendor manual (usually around 30 minutes).
B) GC-MS/MS Analysis
1. Prepare the GC-MS/MS system according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Set up the instrument with necessary columns and tune the MS/MS as per GHB analysis protocol.
3. Run calibration standards to ensure the instrument is correctly calibrated.
4. Inject derivatized urine samples and controls into the GC-MS/MS system.
5. Monitor the chromatograms and mass spectrometry peaks for GHB and internal standards.
6. Identify and quantify GHB in the urine samples using validated software and calibration curves.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
* Review chromatograms and mass spectrometry data for peaks corresponding to GHB.
* Compare results against the reference range for GHB (usually non-detectable to specific cutoff).
* Report results to the LIS (Laboratory Information System) and verify by a trained technologist.
* Document any atypical observations and notify relevant supervisory staff if necessary.
7. REFERENCE INTERVALS
* Gamma-Hydroxybutyric Acid (GHB): Non-detectable (negative) to predetermined cutoff value (according to laboratory policy).
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
* Refer to GC-MS/MS manufacturer's instructions and approved reagent kit insert for specific limitations regarding derivatization reactions and GC-MS/MS operation.
* Potential interferences from substances that may mimic GHB or interfere with analysis should be noted and investigated.
9. REFERENCES
* Vendor GC-MS/MS and derivatization reagent kit manuals.
* Current literature and guidelines on GHB analysis and toxicology.
This SOP must be reviewed and updated annually or as changes to
methodology or instrumentation occur. All personnel must be trained
on this SOP before performing GHB urine analysis.
