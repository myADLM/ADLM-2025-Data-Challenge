Standard Operating Procedure for Assay of Gamma
Glutamyltransferase (GGT), Plasma
1. PURPOSE
This SOP provides guidelines for the quantification of Gamma
Glutamyltransferase (GGT) activity in plasma. The GGT assay
measures the enzymatic activity in the sample, which can be
indicative of liver function and certain diseases.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the trained medical laboratory scientists to
perform, document, and review all the steps of the analytical
procedure. Any deviations and resulting corrective actions must be
recorded and reported to a supervisor or designated personnel.
3. DEFINITION
Gamma Glutamyltransferase (GGT) is an enzyme in plasma that is
involved in the transfer of gamma-glutamyl functional groups.
Elevated GGT activity can be associated with liver disease, bile duct
obstruction, and alcohol consumption.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type:
• Plasma collected in lithium heparin, sodium heparin, or EDTA
tubes.
• Preferred volume: 2 mL of plasma.
• Specimen should be separated from cells within 2 hours of
collection.
Specimen Stability:
• If not analyzed immediately, plasma can be stored at 2-8°C for up
to 48 hours or frozen at -20°C for up to 6 months.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, icteric, or lipemic samples should be avoided as they
may interfere with the results.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Automated chemistry analyzer (with GGT-specific program)
• GGT reagent kit (stored as per manufacturer's instructions)
• Calibrators and controls
• Micropipettes and tips
• Centrifuge
• Sample tubes
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
6. PROCEDURE
Preparation and Calibration:
1. Ensure that the chemistry analyzer is properly calibrated using
the provided calibrators. Calibration must be performed as per
manufacturer’s instructions and at intervals recommended by
the analyzer’s guidelines.
2. Run quality control (QC) samples prior to patient samples. Use
at least two levels of QC material (high and low). Results must
fall within the acceptable range.
Sample Analysis:
1. Thaw and mix plasma samples if they have been stored in a
frozen state.
2. Load plasma samples and GGT reagent into the analyzer as
specified by the equipment's user manual.
3. Enter sample identification information into the analyzer or
associated software.
4. Select the GGT assay protocol on the analyzer and start the
run.
5. The analyzer will measure the enzymatic activity expressed as
U/L.
Post-Analytical Procedure:
1. Review the results produced by the analyzer for consistency
and quality.
2. Document the results in the patient’s electronic medical record
(EMR) or laboratory information system (LIS).
3. If QC results fall outside the acceptable range or any sample
result appears inconsistent, perform troubleshooting and rerun
samples as necessary.
4. Discard used sample tubes and consumables following the
laboratory’s waste disposal guidelines.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
Results must be verified and electronically signed off by the
laboratory technologist before they are reported out. Reference
intervals for GGT activity typically range from 9 – 48 U/L for males
and 7 – 32 U/L for females, but these may vary depending on age,
sex, and specific laboratory guidelines.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
Quality control materials at two concentration levels should be
included in each assay batch. Any deviations from expected QC
values require immediate corrective action and documentation.
Investigate possible cause(s), perform necessary interventions, and
rerun affected patient samples if needed.
9. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
Elevated GGT levels may indicate liver disease, bile duct obstruction,
pancreatitis, or alcohol consumption. It is important to review patient
history and other lab results to interpret GGT activity accurately.
10. TROUBLESHOOTING AND MAINTENANCE
Refer to the chemistry analyzer’s user manual for specific
troubleshooting guidelines. Regular maintenance should be
performed as recommended to avoid technical issues.
11. REFERENCES
Consult reagent kit inserts and the analyzer’s user manual for more
detailed procedures and technical information. Updates and revisions
to methodologies should be informed by current literature,
manufacturer's guidance, and regulatory compliance standards.
12. DOCUMENTATION
All results, QC records, calibrations, and maintenance logs should be
appropriately filed and maintained for reference and compliance with
regulatory guidelines.
