Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analysis of
GANCICLOVIR in Plasma
1. PURPOSE
This procedure outlines the necessary steps for the quantitative
determination of GANCICLOVIR concentration in plasma samples
using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled with
UV detection.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of designated laboratory personnel to conduct
the analysis, maintain and troubleshoot the equipment, and ensure
all quality control measures are met during the procedure.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen:
• Type: Plasma
• Collection Tube: Use a K2 or K3 EDTA vacutainer tube.
Specimen Handling:
• The plasma must be separated from cells within 2 hours of
collection.
• Store the separated plasma at -20°C or colder if not analyzed
immediately.
Stability:
• Plasma samples are stable for up to 72 hours at 4°C.
• Long-term storage should be at -80°C for up to 6 months.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric specimens.
• Samples not processed and stored as specified.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• High Performance Liquid Chromatography system with UV
detector
• Centrifuge capable of 1500 x g
• K2 or K3 EDTA vacutainer tubes
• HPLC-grade solvents (Water, Acetonitrile, Methanol)
• GANCICLOVIR reference standard
• Calibration curve standards
• Quality control samples
• Extraction and reconstitution reagents
4. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation of Standards and Quality Controls:
1. Prepare a series of GANCICLOVIR standard solutions ranging
from 0.1 µg/mL to 10 µg/mL in plasma using the
GANCICLOVIR reference standard.
2. Prepare low, medium, and high-quality control (QC) samples in
plasma in the same solvent as used for the patient samples.
B. Sample Preparation:
1. Thaw plasma samples at room temperature.
2. Pipette 0.5 mL of plasma into labeled centrifuge tubes.
3. Add 1.0 mL of extraction solvent (such as Acetonitrile) to
precipitate proteins.
4. Vortex mix the samples for 1-2 minutes and then centrifuge at
1500 x g for 10 minutes.
5. Transfer the clear supernatant to a new set of labeled tubes.
6. Dry the supernatant under a stream of nitrogen at 40°C.
7. Reconstitute the dried residue in 100 µL of mobile phase (70:30
Water:Acetonitrile).
8. Transfer to an HPLC vial for analysis.
C. HPLC Analysis:
1. Set the HPLC parameters:
◦ Column: C18, 5 µm, 150 x 4.6 mm
◦ Mobile Phase: 70:30 Water:Acetonitrile
◦ Flow rate: 1.0 mL/min
◦ Detector: UV at 254 nm
◦ Injection volume: 20 µL
2. Perform system suitability testing using a system suitability
standard.
3. Inject the standards, QCs, and sample extracts into the HPLC
system.
4. Ensure calibration curve standards show a linear response with
a correlation coefficient (R²) ≥ 0.995.
D. Calculation and Reporting:
1. Quantify the GANCICLOVIR concentration in plasma samples
using the calibration curve.
2. Report results in µg/mL.
3. Review and verify results before releasing them to the LIS.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Analyze QC samples along with each batch of patient samples.
2. Include low, medium, and high QCs and ensure they fall within
the established ranges.
3. Review QC performance and re-validate any batch where QC
results are out of acceptable limits.
6. METHOD LIMITATIONS
1. Ensure proper separation of plasma to avoid interference.
2. The method is specific for GANCICLOVIR and does not
guarantee separation of other similar compounds.
7. REFERENCES
1. GANCICLOVIR product monograph.
2. Instrument manufacturer's HPLC operation manual.
3. Relevant peer-reviewed journal articles adopting similar HPLC-
UV methodology.
8. RECORDS AND DOCUMENTATION
1. Maintain documentation of all calibration curves, QC results,
and patient results.
2. Archive chromatograms and method validation records as per
laboratory protocol.
This SOP is effective from October 2023 and will be reviewed
annually or when new procedures are incorporated.
