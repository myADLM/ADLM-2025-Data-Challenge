Standard Operating Procedure for GANGLIOSIDE ANTIBODIES
EVALUATION, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
This protocol describes the steps necessary to perform the analytical
phase for the evaluation of ganglioside antibodies in serum samples
to ensure precise, accurate, and reproducible results.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all staff members engaged in the analytical
testing of ganglioside antibodies.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all trained laboratory personnel to follow this
procedure accurately and consistently. It is the responsibility of the
supervisor to ensure compliance and to monitor the quality of work
performed.
4. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) Reader
• ELISA Plate Washer
• Incubator set at 37°C
• Microcentrifuge
• Refrigerator (2-8°C)
• Plate Shaker
• Micropipettes and sterile tips
• Deionized water
• Ganglioside Antibody ELISA kit (commercially available)
Reagents:
• Coated Microtiter Plates
• Positive and Negative Controls
• Calibrators/Standards
• Washing Buffer
• Sample Diluent
• Enzyme Conjugate
• Substrate Solution
• Stop Solution
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Collect venous blood using standard aseptic venipuncture
techniques.
• Specimen is to be collected in a serum separator tube (SST).
• Allow the blood to clot for at least 30 minutes (but not more than
60 minutes) at room temperature.
• Centrifuge the SST at 1500 x g for 10 minutes to obtain serum.
• Serum should be separated from the clot as soon as possible and
transferred to a labelled plastic vial.
• Store specimens at 2-8°C if analyzing within 72 hours. For longer
storage, freeze samples at -20°C or lower.
6. PROCEDURE
6.1 Preparation of Reagents
• Prepare all reagents and working standards as specified in the kit
protocol or manufacturer's instructions.
• Bring all reagents to room temperature (20-25°C) before use.
6.2 Sample Preparation
• Dilute each serum sample 1:101 with the sample diluent provided
(e.g., 10 µL serum + 1 mL sample diluent).
6.3 Assay Procedure
1. Plate Sensitization: If plates are not pre-coated, coat the
microtiter wells with specific ganglioside antigen according to
the manufacturer’s instructions and incubate at 4°C overnight.
2. Washing: Use the ELISA plate washer to wash the plates three
times with the provided washing buffer.
3. Blocking: Add blocking buffer to each well and incubate at
37°C for 1 hour to prevent non-specific binding.
4. Sample Addition: Add 100 µL of diluted serum samples,
standards, and controls to the appropriate wells.
5. Incubation: Cover the plate with a lid or sealing tape and
incubate the plate at 37°C for 2 hours.
6. Washing: Wash the plate five times with the washing buffer.
7. Enzyme Conjugate Addition: Add 100 µL of enzyme
conjugate (e.g., anti-human IgG-HRP) to each well.
8. Incubation: Incubate the plate at 37°C for 1 hour.
9. Washing: Wash the plate five times with washing buffer.
10. Substrate Addition: Add 100 µL of substrate solution (e.g.,
TMB) to each well.
11. Color Development: Incubate the plates at room temperature
in the dark for 15-30 minutes, or until optimal color development
is observed.
12. Stopping the Reaction: Add 100 µL of stop solution (e.g., 1M
sulfuric acid) to each well to stop the reaction.
6.4 Measurement
• Measure the optical density (OD) of each well at 450 nm with a
reference wavelength of 620-650 nm using an ELISA reader.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run positive and negative controls with each assay to ensure
assay performance.
• Evaluate the calibration curve with each assay run for validity.
• Please refer to the laboratory's QC SOP for reagent and
instrument maintenance, and daily/weekly QC check
requirements.
8. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
• Utilize the standard curve to determine the concentration of
ganglioside antibodies in the serum samples.
• Compare patient results with the reference range established in
the lab.
• Report quantitative results in the appropriate units as specified for
ganglioside antibodies.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
• Enter the results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS) for
verification.
• Results must be reviewed and verified by a qualified technologist
before final reporting.
• Any critical findings should be flagged and communicated to the
respective healthcare provider promptly.
10. REFERENCE INTERVALS
(Provide the validated reference interval for ganglioside
antibodies here based on literature or internal validation
studies).
11. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolysis, lipemia, or icterus in serum samples may interfere
with assay performance.
• Ensure proper sample handling to avoid repeated freeze-thaw
cycles.
• Results should be interpreted in context of clinical findings and
other diagnostic tests.
12. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's instructions and Inserts for the Ganglioside
Antibody ELISA Kit.
• Relevant medical and clinical laboratory guidelines and literature.
13. REVIEW AND DOCUMENTATION
• Ensure this SOP is reviewed and updated annually, or when new
methodologies are incorporated.
• Verification of this SOP by all department staff must be
documented.
