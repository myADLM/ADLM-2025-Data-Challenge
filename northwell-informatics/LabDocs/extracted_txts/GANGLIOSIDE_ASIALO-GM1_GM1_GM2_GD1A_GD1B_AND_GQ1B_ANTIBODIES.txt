Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for GANGLIOSIDE (ASIALO-
GM1, GM1, GM2, GD1A, GD1B, AND GQ1B) ANTIBODIES
1. PURPOSE To establish a standardized procedure for the
analysis and result generation of ganglioside antibodies
including asialo-GM1, GM1, GM2, GD1a, GD1b, and GQ1b.
This ensures accurate and reliable detection of ganglioside
antibodies to support clinical diagnosis and patient care.
Responsibility: It is the responsibility of designated laboratory
personnel to perform the ganglioside antibody testing and document
results following this SOP. It is the responsibility of the laboratory
supervisor to ensure that all staff are adequately trained and adhere
to the procedures outlined.
1. EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS
• ELISA reader with appropriate software
• Microplate washer
• Incubator (37°C)
• Refrigerated centrifuge
• Pipettes (single and multi-channel)
• Disposable tips
• Vortex mixer
• Micropipettes (for precise adjustments)
• ELISA reagent kit including:
◦ Coated microplates with asialo-GM1, GM1, GM2, GD1a,
GD1b, and GQ1b antigens
◦ Positive and negative control sera
◦ Specific antiserum/conjugate preparation
◦ Wash buffer
◦ Substrate solution
◦ Stop solution
• Deionized/distilled water
• Laboratory bench with appropriate biohazard disposal containers
1. PROCEDURE
3.1. Specimen Handling Acceptable specimens:
• Serum or plasma samples, ideally collected in a plain or EDTA
tube, stored in proper conditions (2-8°C for up to 48 hours, or
frozen at -20°C or lower for long-term storage).
Unacceptable specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or contaminated samples.
• Samples stored above 2-8°C for more than 48 hours.
3.2. Reagent Preparation
• Strictly follow the manufacturer's instructions for preparing all
reagents including washes, conjugates, substrate, and stop
solution.
3.3. Sample Preparation
1. Thaw frozen samples at room temperature and mix well using
vortex mixer.
2. Centrifuge samples if necessary to remove any particulate
matter.
3.4. Assay Procedure
1. Allow all reagents and samples to reach room temperature
before beginning the assay.
2. Add 100 µL of prepared, diluted serum or control to each well of
the ELISA microplate coated with the respective ganglioside
antigen.
3. Incubate the microplate at 37°C for 60 minutes.
4. Wash the plate three times with wash buffer using an
automated or manual microplate washer.
5. Add 100 µL of enzyme-conjugated secondary antibody to each
well.
6. Incubate the microplate at 37°C for 60 minutes.
7. Wash the plate three times with wash buffer.
8. Add 100 µL of substrate solution to each well.
9. Incubate the microplate at room temperature, in the dark, for
15-30 minutes (variable incubation time as per kit insert).
10. Stop the reaction by adding 50 µL of stop solution to each well.
11. Read the absorbance at 450 nm using an ELISA reader within
30 minutes of stopping the reaction.
3.5. Calculation of Results
• Measure and record the optical density (OD) values for each well.
• Construct a standard curve by plotting the OD values of the
standard controls.
• Calculate the antibody concentrations in the patient samples
using the standard curve and appropriate software.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run the positive and negative controls with each assay batch to
ensure the assay is performing correctly.
• Review control results to ensure they are within established
ranges before validating the patient results.
• Re-run the assay if control results fail to meet specified limits.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Validate and review the patient results.
• Report the results following the laboratory’s reporting guidelines.
• Include any flags or comments regarding potential issues with the
specimen quality or technical problems encountered during
testing.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• The reference intervals for ganglioside antibodies should be
established according to the assay kit’s manufacturer
recommendations and validated within each laboratory. Typically,
these intervals are provided in the kit documentation.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to the assay kit manufacturer's documentation for specific
limitations.
• Factors such as hemolysis, lipemia, or bacterial contamination
can affect the test results.
• Results should be interpreted within the clinical context of the
patient and correlated with other diagnostic information.
1. REFERENCES
• Refer to the assay procedure insert provided by the manufacturer.
• Laboratory guidelines and previous validation studies.
This SOP will ensure that all laboratory personnel follow a consistent
and accurate process for generating ganglioside antibody test
results, contributing to high-quality patient diagnostics.
