SOP: Analytical Phase of Generating Results for GANGLIOSIDE
GD1A ANTIBODY (IGG)
1. PURPOSE
To outline the standardized procedure for the analytical phase of
generating results for Ganglioside GD1a Antibody (IgG) testing to
ensure accurate and reliable results.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory staff will perform the Ganglioside GD1a
(IgG) antibody testing as described in this procedure.
• It is the responsibility of the laboratory supervisor to ensure that
staff are adequately trained and that the procedure is followed
precisely.
1. DEFINITION
Ganglioside GD1a Antibody (IgG) testing detects the presence and
level of IgG antibodies against the ganglioside GD1a in patient serum
samples, which is useful for the diagnosis of certain neurological
conditions.
1. PROCEDURE
Specimen Requirements:
• Preferred specimen: 5 mL of serum collected in a serum
separator tube (SST).
• The specimen should be free of hemolysis or lipemia.
• Centrifuge the SST within 1 hour of collection, and transfer the
serum to a clean cryovial if testing is not performed immediately.
• Store serum samples at 2-8°C if testing will occur within 48 hours;
for long-term storage, freeze at -20°C or lower.
Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies:
• ELISA reader or equivalent analytical instrument
• Ganglioside GD1a (IgG) ELISA kit
• Micropipettes and tips
• Pipettors and multichannel pipettes
• Plate washer
• Incubator (37°C)
• Distilled or deionized water
• Calibrated controls and standards
• Microplate reader
Testing Procedure:
1. Allow all reagents, samples, and controls to reach room
temperature (20-25°C) before starting the assay.
2. Prepare the required number of microplate wells, including
wells for standards, controls, and patient samples.
3. Add 100 µL of each standard, control, and sample to the
appropriate wells.
4. Incubate the microplate at 37°C for 1 hour.
5. Wash the wells with the plate washer, using 300 µL of wash
buffer per well for each wash step, for a total of 5 wash cycles.
6. Add 100 µL of enzyme conjugate to each well. Incubate for 30
minutes at room temperature.
7. Wash the wells again using the same wash procedure.
8. Add 100 µL of substrate solution to each well. Incubate at room
temperature for 15-20 minutes in the dark.
9. Add 50 µL of stop solution to each well to terminate the
reaction.
10. Read the absorbance of each well at 450 nm using the ELISA
reader within 15 minutes of stopping the reaction.
Quality Control:
• Run both positive and negative controls with each batch of tests
to ensure test validity.
• Verify calibration of the ELISA reader and maintain documentation
of calibration records.
• Record all control results in the QC log and verify that they fall
within the established acceptable range before proceeding with
patient results.
Calibration and Validation:
• Validate all new lots of reagents by performing a set of controls
and documenting results.
• Perform periodic (e.g., monthly) instrument calibration checks and
inter-instrument comparison studies.
Result Calculation:
• Calculate the mean absorbance for each set of standards,
controls, and patient samples.
• Construct a standard curve by plotting the mean absorbance of
standards on the y-axis versus the concentration on the x-axis.
• Determine the concentration of Ganglioside GD1a Antibody (IgG)
in patient samples by interpolating from the standard curve.
• Report results in appropriate units (e.g., titers or concentrations).
Reporting Results:
• Review and verify all patient results by the technologist.
• Enter verified results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
for appropriate reporting to clinicians.
Critical Results:
• If any results are deemed critical, follow the designated laboratory
protocol for communicating critical values to the ordering
physician, ensuring proper documentation in the LIS.
Method Limitations:
• Interference from hemolytic, lipemic, or icteric samples may affect
test results. If such samples are identified, report with caution.
• Refer to the kit insert for specific limitations and potential sources
of error.

Review and Quality Assurance:
• This SOP will be reviewed annually or as needed to ensure
compliance with regulatory and accreditation standards.
• Record all reviews and updates in the SOP documentation log.
Conclusion: The accurate and precise execution of this protocol will
ensure reliable diagnostic results for the presence of Ganglioside
GD1a Antibody (IgG) in patient serum samples.
