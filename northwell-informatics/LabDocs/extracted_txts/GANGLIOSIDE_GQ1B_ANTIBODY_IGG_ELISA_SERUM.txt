STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE
Title: GANGLIOSIDE GQ1B Antibody, IgG, ELISA, Serum
1. PURPOSE
To provide accurate and consistent results for the determination of
GANGLIOSIDE GQ1B Antibody, IgG in human serum utilizing the
ELISA method.
1. SCOPE
This procedure applies to the Immunology department personnel who
are responsible for performing the GANGLIOSIDE GQ1B Antibody
ELISA test.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all designated laboratory staff to ensure that
the procedures outlined in this document are followed correctly.
Supervisors are responsible for monitoring the compliance and
retraining staff as necessary.
1. DEFINITION
GANGLIOSIDE GQ1B Antibody, IgG: An autoantibody that can be an
indicator for certain neurological conditions.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred Specimen: Serum collected in a plain red-top tube or
serum separator tube (SST).
• Volume: Minimum 0.5 mL serum.
• Storage and Stability: Store specimens at 2-8°C if assay will be
performed within seven days. For longer storage, specimens
should be frozen at -20°C or below. Avoid repeated freeze-thaw
cycles.
1. REAGENTS AND EQUIPMENT
• ELISA Kit specific for GANGLIOSIDE GQ1B Antibody, IgG
◦ Antigen-coated microplate
◦ Wash buffer
◦ Conjugate solution
◦ Substrate solution (TMB or equivalent)
◦ Stop solution (usually sulfuric acid)
◦ Calibrators and Controls
• Micropipettes and disposable tips (20-200 µL)
• Multichannel pipette (optional)
• Plate washer (manual or automated)
• Plate reader with absorbance capabilities at 450 nm (with 630 nm
reference filter if available)
• Incubator (37°C)
• Timer
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation
• Allow all reagents and specimens to reach room temperature
(15-30°C) before starting the assay.
• Prepare the wash buffer as specified in the ELISA kit instructions
if it requires dilution.
• Label microplate wells according to the number of samples,
standards, and controls to be tested.
B. Assay Steps
1. Sample and Reagent Addition
◦ Add calibrators, controls, and serum samples (100 µL) to
the assigned wells of the microplate.
◦ Incubate for 1 hour at 37°C while gently rocking the plate to
mix.
2. Washing
◦ Aspirate and wash the wells 3-5 times with wash buffer.
Ensure complete removal of all liquid at each step.
3. Conjugate Addition
◦ Add 100 µL of conjugate solution to each well.
◦ Incubate at 37°C for 30 minutes.
4. Washing
◦ Repeat the washing step as described above.
5. Substrate Addition
◦ Add 100 µL of TMB substrate to each well.
◦ Incubate at room temperature for 10-20 minutes in the dark.
Do not exceed 20 minutes.
6. Stop Reaction
◦ Add 100 µL of stop solution to each well in the same
sequence as the substrate addition to ensure uniform
stopping of reaction.
◦ Gently tap the plate to ensure thorough mixing of stop
solution.
C. Reading the Plate
• Read the absorbance of each well at 450 nm with 630 nm
reference filter if available within 30 minutes of stopping the
reaction.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run positive and negative controls with each batch of tests.
• Verify calibrator results align with manufacturer’s expected ranges
before validating patient results.
• If controls fall outside the acceptable range, interpret test results
with caution and consider repeating the assay or informing a
supervisor.
1. RESULT INTERPRETATION
• Determine the concentration of GANGLIOSIDE GQ1B IgG
antibody in each sample by comparing the absorbance readings
to the standard curve generated using the calibrators.
• Use the provided calculation formula or software to convert
absorbance values into concentration units (typically expressed in
arbitrary units, AU/mL or equivalent).
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results are to be entered into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS) once verified.
• Report GANGLIOSIDE GQ1B Antibody, IgG levels alongside
reference ranges provided within the ELISA kit documentation.
• Communicate any critical values immediately according to
laboratory policy.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING
Common issues may include non-specific signal, poor standard
curve, or high background. Steps to address these include:
• Ensure proper washing technique and timing.
• Verify that all reagents were added correctly and incubations were
followed as specified.
• Check for expired or improperly stored reagents.
