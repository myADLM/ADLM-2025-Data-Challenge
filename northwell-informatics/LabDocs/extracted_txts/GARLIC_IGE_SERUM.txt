Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for GARLIC, IGE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedures for processing, analyzing, and generating
results for Garlic-specific Immunoglobulin E (IgE) in serum samples.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of trained laboratory personnel to ensure that
all procedures outlined in this SOP are followed accurately and
consistently to obtain reliable and reproducible results.
1. SCOPE
This SOP covers the steps from the receipt of the serum samples in
the analytical phase to the generation and reporting of results for
Garlic-specific IgE.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies
• ELISA Reader or Chemiluminescence Immunoassay Analyzer
• Incubator (37°C)
• Microplate Washer
• Vortex Mixer
• Calibration Standards and Quality Controls (Low, Medium, High)
• Reagents for IgE Assay
• Serum samples
• Pipettes and tips
• Microplates
• Laboratory timer
• Disposable gloves
B. Sample Preparation
1. Verify all serum samples are correctly labelled and correspond
to the laboratory requisitions.
2. Ensure samples are at room temperature before testing.
3. Centrifuge each sample (if necessary) to separate serum from
cellular components.
C. Assay Protocol
i. ELISA Protocol
1. Prepare all reagents, standards, and samples as per the
manufacturer’s instructions. Ensure all reagents are at room
temperature before use.
2. Add predetermined volumes of standards, controls, and serum
samples to the microplate wells.
3. Add enzyme conjugate to each well and incubate the plate at
37°C for the specified time.
4. Wash the plate thoroughly using a microplate washer to remove
any unbound substances.
5. Add substrate solution to each well and incubate the plate for a
designated time.
6. Add stop solution to terminate the reaction.
7. Read the absorbance of each well using an ELISA reader at the
specified wavelength.
ii. Chemiluminescence Immunoassay (CLIA) Protocol
1. Prepare all reagents, standards, and samples as per the
manufacturer’s instructions. Ensure all reagents are at room
temperature before use.
2. Load standards, controls, and serum samples into the assigned
wells of the microplate.
3. Add magnetic particles coated with antigen-specific antibodies
to each well.
4. Incubate the plate at 37°C for a specific period to allow the
binding reaction to occur.
5. Wash the plate to remove unbound substances.
6. Add the chemiluminescent substrate to each well.
7. Measure the emitted light using a CLIA analyzer.
D. Quality Control
1. Run quality control samples (low, medium, high) with each
batch of tests to ensure assay integrity.
2. Compare the results of control samples against the expected
range. If controls fall outside the expected range, troubleshoot
the assay and repeat the run.
3. Document all control results and any corrective actions in the
Quality Control log.
E. Calculation and Interpretation of Results
1. Generate a standard curve by plotting the absorbance or
luminescence readings of the standards.
2. Calculate the concentration of Garlic-specific IgE in serum
samples by interpolating the standard curve.
3. Express the results in kilo units per liter (kU/L).
F. Reporting Results
1. Review and verify results using the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
2. Enter confirmed results into the LIS, ensuring all patient records
are accurately updated.
3. Critical results should be flagged and communicated to the
appropriate healthcare provider promptly.
4. MAINTENANCE AND TROUBLESHOOTING
• Regularly maintain all equipment as per manufacturer guidelines.
• Perform routine calibration and validation of the analyzers.
• Document any incidents of equipment malfunction or procedural
anomalies, and take appropriate corrective action.
