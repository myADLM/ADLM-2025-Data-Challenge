Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for GARLIC IgG Analysis
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized method for the analysis and reporting of
GARLIC IgG levels in patient samples using enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technology. The intention is to ensure
consistent, accurate, and reliable testing that meets CLIA standards.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for following this
SOP.
• Laboratory supervisors are responsible for ensuring adherence to
protocol and for addressing any deviations from the procedure.
1. DEFINITION
GARLIC IgG analysis involves the quantification of Immunoglobulin G
(IgG) antibodies specific to garlic allergens in a patient’s serum. This
is performed using the ELISA technique.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred specimen: Serum obtained by drawing blood into a
plain red-top tube.
• Specimen stability: Serum should be separated within 2 hours of
collection and stored at 2-8°C if analysed within 7 days. For
longer storage, specimens should be frozen at -20°C.
• Unacceptable specimens:
◦ Hemolyzed samples
◦ Lipemic samples
◦ Samples submitted in tubes containing anticoagulants (e.g.,
EDTA, heparin).
1. EQUIPMENT & REAGENTS
• ELISA reader (capable of reading at 450 nm and 620-630 nm)
• Micropipettes and tips
• Multichannel pipette (optional)
• Microplate washer (optional)
• GARLIC IgG ELISA kit (including pre-coated plates with garlic
antigen, calibrators, controls, enzyme conjugate, substrate, stop
solution, and wash buffer)
• Incubator (37°C)
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparing the ELISA Kit
• Ensure all reagents, calibrators, controls, and samples are
brought to room temperature (20-25°C) before use.
• Prepare the wash buffer according to the kit’s instructions.
B. Running the ELISA
1. Sample Dilution and Plate Setup a. Dilute patient serum
samples 1:100 in provided diluent. For example, mix 10 µL of
serum with 990 µL of diluent. b. Add 100 µL of calibrators,
controls, and diluted patient samples to designated wells on the
pre-coated plate.
2. Incubation a. Incubate the plate at 37°C for 30 minutes.
3. Washing a. Wash the wells of the plate at least 5 times with the
prepared wash buffer. For manual washing, fill the wells
completely with the wash buffer, then aspirate or invert and blot
the plate.
4. Adding Conjugate a. Add 100 µL of enzyme conjugate to each
well. b. Incubate the plate at 37°C for 30 minutes in the dark.
5. Washing a. Repeat the washing step as described above.
6. Adding Substrate a. Add 100 µL of TMB substrate to each well.
b. Incubate the plate at room temperature for 15 minutes in the
dark.
7. Stopping Reaction a. Add 100 µL of stop solution to each well to
stop the enzyme reaction.
8. Reading the Plate a. Read the plate at 450 nm with a
differential filter of 620-630 nm.
9. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run positive and negative controls with each batch of patient
samples.
• Ensure that the optical density (OD) values of these controls fall
within the manufacturer’s specified ranges.
• Internal and external quality controls should be analyzed under
the same conditions as patient samples and results documented.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Calculate the patient IgG levels using the standard curve
generated from the calibrators' OD values.
• Express results in the units as specified by the ELISA kit
manufacturer.
• Validate the results by comparing them against reference ranges.
Document any deviations/abnormal findings and inform the
supervisor.
Note: Reference intervals or cut-off values specific to the kit must be
adhered to.
1. INTERPRETATION
• Quantitative results should be interpreted in the clinical context.
• Consider clinical symptoms, other diagnostic tests, and patient
history in the interpretation.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Cross-reactivity with other allergens may occur, leading to
potential false positives.
• Hemolysis and lipemia can interfere with ELISA performance.
• Interpretation should not rely solely on serology; clinical
correlation is necessary.

1. ASSAY TROUBLESHOOTING
• If controls are out of range, re-run the assay if necessary.
• Consult manufacturer’s troubleshooting guide for common issues.
