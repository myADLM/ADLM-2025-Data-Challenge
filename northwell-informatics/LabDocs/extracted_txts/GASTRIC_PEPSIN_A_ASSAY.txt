may arise.
4. RELATED DOCUMENTS
• Instrument Operation Manual
• Quality Control Logs
• Equipment Maintenance Logs
• Sample Handling and Storage Guidelines
5. DEFINITIONS
• Gastric Pepsin A: An enzyme produced in the stomach that is
crucial for the digestion of proteins.
• Assay: A procedure to measure the presence and amount of a
substance.
6. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimens:
• Preferred: Gastric aspirate collected using an appropriate, sterile
technique.
• Unacceptable: Samples that are hemolyzed, contain food
particles, or are improperly stored.
Storage:
• Store samples at 2-8°C if not immediately processed. Should be
processed within 24 hours to maintain stability.
• If long-term storage is required, freeze samples at -20°C or lower.
7. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• ELISA Reader or equivalent analytical instrument
• Gastric Pepsin A ELISA Kit
• Micropipettes and tips (10 µL, 100 µL, 1000 µL)
• Distilled or deionized water
• Timer
• Refrigerated centrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Disposable gloves and lab coat
8. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform quality control with each batch of samples.
• Use both positive and negative controls provided with the ELISA
kit.
• Maintain a log of all quality control results and ensure they fall
within the established ranges for validity.
9. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation
1. Turn on the ELISA Reader and calibrate as per manufacturer’s
instructions.
2. Allow all reagents and samples to reach room temperature
before beginning.
3. Vortex all samples and quality control materials before use.
B. Assay Procedure
1. Label each well of the microtiter plate according to your sample
and control layout.
2. Add 100 µL of standards, controls, and samples to the
designated wells.
3. Add 50 µL of enzyme conjugate to each well. Gently tap the
plate to mix.
4. Incubate the plate at 37°C for 60 minutes in an incubator.
5. Wash the plate 5 times with the provided wash buffer. Ensure
that each well is completely rinsed.
6. Add 100 µL of substrate solution to each well.
7. Incubate the plate in the dark at room temperature for 15-20
minutes.
8. Add 100 µL of stop solution to each well to terminate the
reaction.
9. Read the absorbance at 450 nm using the ELISA Reader within
30 minutes of adding the stop solution.
C. Data Analysis
1. Generate a standard curve by plotting the optical density (OD)
against the concentration of each standard.
2. Determine the concentration of Gastric Pepsin A in the samples
by comparing their OD to the standard curve.
3. Record the results in Laboratory Information System (LIS) and
ensure proper documentation.
10. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results are automatically transmitted to the LIS and must be
reviewed and verified by the technologist.
• Report critical findings to the appropriate healthcare provider
immediately following laboratory policy.
11. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Ensure that there is no cross-reaction with other proteins.
• Interferences might include hemolysis, improper sample
collection, and storage.
12. MAINTENANCE
• Clean and calibrate the ELISA Reader and other equipment
regularly following manufacturer’s guidelines.
• Document all maintenance actions in the appropriate logs.
