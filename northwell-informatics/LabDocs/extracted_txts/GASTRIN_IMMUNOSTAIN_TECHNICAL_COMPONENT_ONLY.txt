STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase for Gastrin Immunostain, Technical
Component Only
1. PURPOSE
To standardize the procedure for performing the technical component
of immunohistochemical (IHC) staining for Gastrin, ensuring
consistent and accurate results.
2. SCOPE
This procedure is applicable to the technical staff responsible for
performing IHC staining for Gastrin in a CLIA-certified laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
The designated technical staff is responsible for following this SOP,
performing immunostaining procedures, and documenting the
process appropriately. It is the responsibility of all staff to identify any
issues that may affect the quality of the results and to notify the
supervisor immediately.
4. MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT
• Gastrin primary antibody
• Secondary antibody with appropriate enzyme label
• Detection kit (e.g., DAB HRP detection kit)
• Positive control tissue (e.g., normal gastric antrum)
• Negative control (tissue processed without primary antibody)
• Antigen retrieval solution (e.g., sodium citrate buffer or EDTA)
• BSA or casein block solution
• Buffer solutions (e.g., phosphate-buffered saline, PBS)
• Microscope slides (preferably Superfrost Plus)
• Coverslips and mounting medium
• Automated immunostainer (if applicable)
• Humidity chamber (if manual staining)
5. PROCEDURE
5.1 Specimen Preparation
• Confirm that the tissue specimens are adequately fixed and
embedded in paraffin.
• Cut 3-4 μm thick sections from the paraffin-embedded tissue
blocks.
• Mount sections on microscope slides and label appropriately.
5.2 Deparaffinization and Rehydration
• Deparaffinize slides by incubating in xylene for 2-3 minutes,
changing xylene solution twice.
• Rehydrate slides through a graded alcohol series (100%, 95%,
70%) into distilled water.
5.3 Antigen Retrieval
• Perform antigen retrieval by placing slides in preheated retrieval
solution (e.g., sodium citrate buffer, pH 6.0, or EDTA, pH 9.0) and
heating in a microwave or pressure cooker as per manufacturer
recommendations.
• Allow slides to cool to room temperature and wash in PBS.
5.4 Blocking
• Incubate slides in blocking solution (e.g., 5% BSA or casein) for
20-30 minutes at room temperature to block nonspecific binding
sites.
• Tap off excess blocking solution without washing.
5.5 Primary Antibody Incubation
• Apply the primary antibody for Gastrin to the tissue sections.
• Incubate for 1-2 hours at room temperature or overnight at 4°C in
a humidity chamber.
5.6 Washing
• Wash slides in PBS for 3 x 5 minutes each.
5.7 Secondary Antibody Incubation
• Apply the secondary antibody (linked to HRP or other enzyme) to
the tissue sections.
• Incubate for 30 minutes to 1 hour at room temperature in a
humidity chamber.
5.8 Washing
• Wash slides in PBS for 3 x 5 minutes each.
5.9 Detection
• Apply the detection reagent (e.g., DAB substrate) according to
manufacturer's instructions.
• Monitor the development of staining under a microscope to
achieve optimal intensity.
• Stop the reaction by dipping slides in distilled water.
5.10 Counterstaining and Mounting
• Counterstain with hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes if desired.
• Wash slides in tap water and then bluing reagent.
• Dehydrate through graded alcohols (70%, 95%, 100%) and clear
in xylene.
• Apply coverslips with mounting medium.
5.11 Quality Control
• Include positive and negative control slides in each staining batch.
• Ensure appropriate staining is observed in control tissues.
• Document any discrepancies or aberrations in the staining
procedure and notify the supervisor.
6. INTERPRETATION AND DOCUMENTATION
• Only the technical component is addressed in this protocol. The
interpretation of stained slides will be performed by the
pathologist.
• Document all steps in the immunostaining process, including
antibody lot numbers, incubation times, and any deviations
observed.
