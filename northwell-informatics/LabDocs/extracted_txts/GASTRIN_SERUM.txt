Standard Operating Procedure for GASTRIN, SERUM Analysis
1. PURPOSE This SOP outlines the procedure for the analysis of
Gastrin levels in serum specimens. Accurate quantification of Gastrin
is crucial for diagnostic purposes, including the evaluation of gastric
function and detection of gastrointestinal disorders.
Responsibility: All laboratory personnel who perform Gastrin, serum
analysis are responsible for following the protocol outlined in this
SOP. It is also the responsibility of the designated supervisors to
ensure that procedures are strictly adhered to and to address any
issues that may arise during the analytical phase.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS Specimen Type: Serum Preferred
Collection Container: SST (Serum Separator Tube) Minimum Volume:
2 mL Specimen Stability:
• Refrigerated (2-8°C): 7 days
• Frozen (-20°C or lower): 3 months
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens with significant hemolysis
• Specimens collected in non-SST containers
• Specimens that are improperly labeled or do not have a
documented collection date/time
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Automated Immunoassay Analyzer (e.g., Cobas e 411)
• Gastrin Calibrators and Controls (Low, Medium, High)
• Reagent Kit specific for Gastrin analysis (manufacturer: Roche
Diagnostics or equivalent)
• SST collection tubes
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes and tips
• Refrigeration units for specimen storage
4. PROCEDURE A) Sample Preparation:
1. Upon receiving the serum specimens, ensure proper labeling
and documentation.
2. Centrifuge the SST tube at 1500 g for 10 minutes to separate
serum.
3. Transfer serum aliquots into appropriately labeled sample cups
or tubes.
4. Refrigerate or freeze samples as per storage guidelines if
immediate analysis is not possible.
B) Analyzer Setup:
1. Power on the Immunoassay Analyzer and ensure it is properly
calibrated.
2. Load the Gastrin reagent kit, calibrators, and quality controls
onto the analyzer following manufacturer instructions.
3. Program the analyzer with the correct assay parameters for
Gastrin.
4. Perform a system check and ensure no error messages are
displayed.
C) Assay Execution:
1. Load the prepared serum samples onto the analyzer.
2. Verify sample identification against the worklist to ensure
accurate tracking.
3. Initiate the assay run. The analyzer will perform the test
automatically, including the addition of reagents and incubation
periods as programmed.
D) Quality Control:
1. Run quality control samples (Low, Medium, High) at the start of
each assay and after every 20 patient samples.
2. Confirm that QC results fall within the established acceptable
range.
3. Document QC results and take corrective actions if controls fall
outside the acceptable limit (e.g., recalibration, repeating the
assay).
E) Result Verification:
1. Upon completion of the assay, review the results displayed by
the analyzer for each specimen.
2. Verify that all control samples are within acceptable limits and
the instrument did not report any errors.
3. Confirm the integrity of the sample results (e.g., no unexplained
high or low values).
5. REPORTING RESULTS
• Transfer the verified results from the analyzer to the Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
• Review and validate each result before final reporting.
• Communicate any critical values as per laboratory policy.
Reference Intervals:
• Fasting Serum Gastrin: ≤ 100 pg/mL
• Non-fasting Serum Gastrin: Variable depending on timing and
recent food intake
6. TROUBLESHOOTING AND METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to manufacturer’s manual for specific assay limitations.
• Document any troubleshooting steps taken and recurring issues
with the analyzer or reagents.
• In cases where analytical results are outside the expected range
or show interference, notify the supervisor and follow internal
guidelines for assay validation or repetition.

• Manufacturer's Reagent Kit Insert for Gastrin
• Quality control guidelines and calibration certificates
• Internal laboratory procedural manuals on result reporting and
critical value handling
8. DOCUMENTATION
• Ensure all steps are documented in the Temperature Monitoring
Log, QC logs, and LIS.
• Maintain copies of any corrective actions and instrument
maintenance logs.
