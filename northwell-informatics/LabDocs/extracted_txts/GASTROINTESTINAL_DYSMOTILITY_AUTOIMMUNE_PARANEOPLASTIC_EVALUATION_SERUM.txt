Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase:
Gastrointestinal Dysmotility, Autoimmune/Paraneoplastic
Evaluation, Serum
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedures for the analysis, generation, and reporting
of results for the evaluation of gastrointestinal dysmotility,
autoimmune/paraneoplastic conditions from serum specimens,
ensuring accuracy, reliability, and compliance with CLIA regulations.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
All designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing
the analysis as detailed in this procedure. It is the responsibility of the
laboratory supervisor to ensure that all staff are trained on this SOP
and adhere to quality control and documentation protocols.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/acceptable specimen:
• 5 mL serum collected in a serum separator tube (SST) or red-top
tube.
• Specimens must be properly labeled with patient information and
collection date/time.
Unacceptable specimens:
• Specimens received in heparinized, EDTA, or citrate tubes.
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples may interfere with the test
and should be evaluated for suitability.
• Specimens with insufficient volume or those not properly labeled.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Centrifuge
• Automated immunoassay analyzer
• Pipettes and tips
• Reagents specific to the tests for autoimmune/paraneoplastic
markers:
◦ Anti-Hu
◦ Anti-Ri
◦ Anti-Yo
◦ Anti-GAD
◦ Anti-amphiphysin
◦ ANNA-1, ANNA-2, PCA-1, PCA-2
• Controls (positive and negative)
• Quality control materials
• Laboratory Information System (LIS) access
5. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Preparation:
1. Upon receipt, specimens should be logged into the LIS and
checked for proper labeling and volume.
2. Centrifuge the serum tubes at 1500 g for 10 minutes at room
temperature.
3. Aliquot the clear serum into appropriately labeled secondary
tubes if necessary.
B. Instrument Setup and Calibration:
1. Power on the immunoassay analyzer.
2. Perform daily maintenance and calibration as per manufacturer
instructions.
3. Load reagents and ensure they are not expired or
compromised.
4. Load quality control materials and verify that control results are
within acceptable ranges.
C. Running the Assays:
1. Program the analyzer for the specific tests required for
gastrointestinal dysmotility and autoimmune/paraneoplastic
evaluation.
2. Load the prepared serum specimens onto the analyzer
following the instrument's loading protocol.
3. Initiate the analysis run and verify that all specimens are
correctly positioned.
4. Monitor the run progress and attend to any instrument alerts or
errors.
D. Quality Control and Troubleshooting:
1. Ensure that internal quality controls (positive and negative) are
included in each run.
2. Verify that QC results are within specified limits before
analyzing patient samples. If QC fails, troubleshoot according to
the manufacturer's guidelines and repeat QC testing.
3. Document any corrective actions taken in the QC log.
E. Result Interpretation and Reporting:
1. Results will be automatically transmitted to the LIS and flagged
for review.
2. Technologists must review all results for consistency, validity,
and any flagged issues.
3. In case of any abnormal results or interference patterns, verify
results by re-analysis or additional testing as required.
4. Enter final verified results into the LIS and generate a report for
the clinician.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform and document daily equipment checks and maintenance.
• Analyze quality control samples at the beginning and end of each
batch or according to schedule.
• Maintain records of calibration, maintenance, control results, and
any issues encountered with corrective actions.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
• Follow site-specific guidelines for result entry and report
generation.
• Critical values should be immediately communicated to the
clinician following laboratory protocol.
• Maintain confidentiality and accuracy in reporting.
8. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's instructions for the specific immunoassay
analyzer.
• Package inserts for individual test reagents.
• Laboratory quality control and maintenance logs.
9. DOCUMENTATION
• Ensure all steps taken are recorded in the LIS.
• Keep all maintenance and QC logs updated.
• Document any deviations or issues encountered and the steps
taken to resolve them.
This SOP ensures that the analytical process for gastrointestinal
dysmotility and autoimmune/paraneoplastic evaluation is performed
accurately and consistently, adhering to CLIA standards and best
laboratory practices.
