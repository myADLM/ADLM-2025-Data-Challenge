Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Gastrointestinal
Pathogen Panel, PCR, Feces
1. Purpose:
To provide a standardized method for the detection and identification
of gastrointestinal pathogens using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
from feces specimens.
2. Scope:
This protocol applies to all laboratory personnel involved in the
analysis and reporting results of gastrointestinal pathogen panels
using PCR technology.
3. Responsibilities:
• It is the responsibility of the laboratory personnel to ensure proper
handling and processing of specimens.
• Supervisors shall ensure that necessary training, quality control,
and maintenance are performed.
4. Specimen Requirements:
Preferred/Acceptable:
• Freshly collected feces in a sterile container. The specimen
should be transported to the laboratory as soon as possible,
ideally within 2 hours of collection.
• If transportation exceeds 2 hours, the specimen should be
refrigerated at 2-8°C and should not exceed 24 hours in transit.
Unacceptable:
• Specimens arriving in the laboratory more than 24 hours after
collection without refrigeration.
• Specimens without proper labeling (patient’s name, date, and time
of collection).
• Specimens in non-sterile containers or with visible signs of
contamination.
Note:
• For optimal results, ensure that the specimen has not been
exposed to extreme temperatures or preservatives.
5. Equipment and Reagents:
• PCR Instrument (e.g., Thermocycler)
• DNA extraction kit
• PCR master mix
• Primers and probes specific to the gastrointestinal panel
• Sterile pipettes and pipette tips
• Sterile microcentrifuge tubes
• Nuclease-free water
6. Quality Control:
• Internal controls included in every run should be recorded and
reviewed.
• Positive and negative control samples should be run with each
batch of tests to ensure the accuracy of the PCR reaction.
• Ensure instruments and reagents are within the expiration date
and are stored as per manufacturer’s recommendations.
7. Procedure:
A. Specimen Preparation:
1. Preliminary Steps:
◦ Confirm that the specimen meets the acceptance criteria.
◦ Label all reagents, tubes, and PCR plates with the
appropriate identifiers.
2. DNA Extraction:
◦ Using an appropriate DNA extraction kit, extract DNA from
200 mg of feces according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
◦ Ensure all DNA extraction steps are completed in a clean
area to avoid contamination.
◦ Store extracted DNA at 4°C if processed within a few hours,
or at -20°C for longer storage.
B. PCR Setup:
1. Master Mix Preparation:
◦ Thaw all reagents on ice before use.
◦ Prepare a PCR master mix on ice containing the appropriate
volumes of nuclease-free water, PCR buffer, dNTPs, MgCl2,
primers, probes, and Taq polymerase according to the
manufacturer's protocol for the gastrointestinal pathogen
panel.
2. Sample Addition:
◦ Aliquot 25 µL of the PCR master mix into each well of a
sterile PCR plate.
◦ Add 5 µL of the extracted DNA sample to the corresponding
wells.
◦ Ensure that both positive and negative controls are included
in the run.
3. PCR Amplification:
◦ Seal the PCR plate with an appropriate adhesive film.
◦ Load the plate into the PCR instrument and initiate the run
as per the thermal cycling parameters specified by the PCR
kit manufacturer.
C. Data Analysis:
1. Post-Amplification:
◦ Upon completion of the PCR run, analyze the data using the
instrument’s software.
◦ Review the amplification plots for each target pathogen and
control.
2. Interpretation and Reporting:
◦ A sample is considered positive if the amplification curve
crosses the threshold within the specified cycle threshold
(Ct) range.
◦ Ensure all results are verified and documented accurately.
◦ Communicate results through the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
8. Reporting Results:
• Results are automatically transmitted to the LIS and must be
reviewed and verified by the technologist.
• Report findings in standardized formats including pathogen
detected/ not detected and corresponding Ct values.
9. Method Limitations:
• PCR testing has high sensitivity and specificity but may not
differentiate between viable and non-viable organisms.
• False positives or negatives can occur due to technical errors or
presence of PCR inhibitors.
10. References:
• Manufacturer's instructions for the PCR kit used.
• Relevant published literature and guidelines on gastrointestinal
pathogen molecular diagnostics.
11. Documentation:
• All steps, observations, and deviations to be logged in designated
laboratory logbooks.
• Ensure all records are maintained as per regulatory requirements.
Review and Update:
• This SOP should be reviewed annually and updated as necessary
to reflect any changes in technology or laboratory practice.
