Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase of Generating Results for GATA-
BINDING PROTEIN 2, GATA2, FULL GENE ANALYSIS
via Next-Generation Sequencing
1. PURPOSE
To establish a standardized procedure for the analytical phase of
generating results for the GATA2 full gene analysis using next-
generation sequencing (NGS). This includes data processing, variant
calling, annotation, and interpretation to ensure accurate and reliable
diagnostic results.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to the analytical phase of GATA2 gene sequencing
testing conducted in our CLIA-certified laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory personnel, including molecular biologists,
bioinformaticians, and geneticists, are responsible for adhering to this
SOP during the data analysis phase. It is the responsibility of the
laboratory supervisor to ensure that all personnel are adequately
trained and that the procedure is followed correctly.
4. DEFINITIONS
• NGS (Next-Generation Sequencing): A method used to
sequence DNA with high throughput, generating thousands to
millions of sequences concurrently.
• GATA2: A gene that encodes a protein involved in regulating the
development of hematopoietic cells.
• Variant Calling: The process of identifying variations from
sequence data compared to a reference genome.
• Annotation: The process of identifying the functional impact of
genetic variants and their association with diseases.
5. PROCEDURE
A. Initial Sequencing Data Processing
1. Raw Data Acquisition:
◦ Obtain raw sequencing data (.fastq files) from the NGS
platform.
◦ Transfer raw data to the designated analysis server for
processing.
2. Quality Control:
◦ Perform initial quality assessment of raw reads using tools
such as FastQC.
◦ Generate a quality control report and review the results.
◦ Perform necessary data cleaning/trimming using tools like
Trimmomatic to remove low-quality bases and adapter
sequences.
◦ Ensure that the reads have a Phred quality score ≥ Q30 for
≥ 80% of the bases.
3. Alignment:
◦ Align cleaned reads to the reference genome (UCSC hg19/
GRCh37 or UCSC hg38/GRCh38, depending on the lab's
version in use) using BWA-MEM.
◦ Sort and index the aligned reads using SAMtools.
◦ Remove PCR duplicates using Picard MarkDuplicates.
B. Variant Calling
1. Generate Variant Calls:
◦ Use GATK HaplotypeCaller or an equivalent tool to perform
variant calling on the aligned reads.
◦ Generate a variant call format (VCF) file containing detected
variants.
2. Variant Filtering:
◦ Apply standard filtering criteria (minimum read depth, base
quality, mapping quality, etc.) using tools like GATK
VariantFiltration.
◦ Filter out low-quality variants and retain only high-
confidence calls.
C. Variant Annotation
1. Annotate Variants:
◦ Annotate the filtered variants using tools like Annovar, VEP,
or equivalent.
◦ Include annotation details such as gene impact, population
frequency from databases like dbSNP, 1000 Genomes,
ExAC, gnomAD, predicted pathogenicity, and clinical
relevance.
2. Evaluate Variants:
◦ Review annotations and identify variants of clinical
significance.
◦ Classify variants according to ACMG guidelines
(pathogenic, likely pathogenic, VUS, likely benign, benign).
D. Data Interpretation and Reporting
1. Interpret Variants:
◦ Evaluate the clinical relevance of identified variants in the
context of GATA2-related conditions.
◦ Correlate findings with available patient clinical data and
relevant literature.
2. Report Generation:
◦ Compile a comprehensive report including the methods,
findings, and interpretation.
◦ Include information on detected pathogenic and likely
pathogenic variants with their potential clinical impact.
◦ Provide recommendations for follow-up testing, if applicable.
3. Quality Control:
◦ Include a section on the technical quality of the sequencing
data and analysis.
◦ Document any failed QC metrics and corrective actions
taken.
4. Review and Verification:
◦ The final report should be reviewed and verified by a senior
geneticist or molecular biologist.
◦ Ensure accurate reporting and clear communication of
results.
E. Documentation and Record Keeping
• Ensure all analytical steps, software versions, and parameters
used are documented.
• Store raw data, intermediary files, and final reports in accordance
with laboratory data retention policies.
• Maintain a secure backup of all data and reports.

7. REVIEW AND REVISION HISTORY
• SOP Version 1.0: Initial release (October 2023)
This SOP will be reviewed annually or as necessary to incorporate
updated procedures, standards, and technological advancements.
Feedback from laboratory staff is encouraged to improve the protocol
continuously.
This protocol was developed for the analytical phase of generating
results for GATA2 full gene analysis using next-generation
sequencing, in compliance with CLIA regulatory requirements.
Please ensure adherence to this SOP to maintain laboratory
accreditation and ensure high-quality diagnostic results.
