Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for GATA-BINDING PROTEIN
3 IMMUNOSTAIN, TECHNICAL COMPONENT ONLY, BONE
MARROW
1. PURPOSE
This SOP provides a detailed procedure for the technical component
of processing and staining bone marrow samples for GATA-binding
protein 3 (GATA3) Immunostain in a clinical laboratory setting.
1. SCOPE
This procedure applies to the technical staff responsible for
performing immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining on bone marrow
samples within the laboratory.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
The laboratory personnel who are trained to perform IHC staining
techniques are responsible for following this procedure. It is their
responsibility to ensure the correct execution of the steps outlined in
this SOP to maintain the integrity and accuracy of test results.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
4.1. Acceptable Specimen:
• Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) bone marrow biopsy.
4.2. Unacceptable Specimen:
• Specimens that are not adequately fixed.
• Specimens not properly labeled or with a compromised integrity.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
5.1. Equipment:
• Microtome
• Water bath
• Coplin jars or staining racks
• Immunostainer or manual staining setup
• Microplate shaker
5.2. Reagents:
• Xylene
• Ethanol (100%, 95%, 80%, and 70%)
• Distilled water
• Peroxidase block
• Primary antibody against GATA3
• Secondary antibody (HRP-conjugated)
• Detection system (e.g., DAB chromogen)
• Hematoxylin counterstain
• Mounting medium
1. PROCEDURE
6.1. Sectioning: 6.1.1. Ensure that the FFPE bone marrow block is
adequately cooled. 6.1.2. Cut 3-5μm thick sections using a
microtome and place them on charged glass slides. 6.1.3. Bake the
slides at 60°C for 1 hour to ensure proper adhesion of sections.
6.2. Deparaffinization and Rehydration: 6.2.1. Place slides in xylene
for 2 x 5 minutes. 6.2.2. Rehydrate sections through a graded ethanol
series: - 100% ethanol, 2 x 3 minutes - 95% ethanol, 2 minutes - 80%
ethanol, 2 minutes - 70% ethanol, 2 minutes 6.2.3. Rinse slides in
distilled water, 2 x 2 minutes.
6.3. Antigen Retrieval: 6.3.1. Perform antigen retrieval using a
suitable method (e.g., heat-induced or enzymatic). 6.3.2. Allow slides
to cool to room temperature and rinse in distilled water.
6.4. Staining Protocol: 6.4.1. Block endogenous peroxidase activity
by immersing slides in peroxidase block solution for 10 minutes.
6.4.2. Rinse slides in wash buffer. 6.4.3. Apply primary antibody
against GATA3 and incubate according to manufacturer's instructions
(typically 1-2 hours). 6.4.4. Rinse slides in wash buffer, 3 x 5 minutes.
6.4.5. Apply secondary antibody and incubate for 30 minutes. 6.4.6.
Rinse slides in wash buffer, 3 x 5 minutes. 6.4.7. Apply the detection
system (DAB chromogen) and incubate for the manufacturer's
recommended time. 6.4.8. Rinse slides in distilled water until clear.
6.5. Counterstaining and Mounting: 6.5.1. Counterstain with
hematoxylin for 1 minute. 6.5.2. Rinse slides in distilled water. 6.5.3.
Dehydrate sections in graded ethanol series: - 70% ethanol, 2
minutes - 80% ethanol, 2 minutes - 95% ethanol, 2 minutes - 100%
ethanol, 2 x 3 minutes 6.5.4. Clear sections in xylene, 2 x 3 minutes.
6.5.5. Mount sections using a suitable permanent mounting medium.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
7.1. Run positive and negative controls with each batch of slides to
ensure staining quality and specificity. 7.2. Verify results with a
pathologist, if necessary. 7.3. Document any deviations or issues
encountered during the procedure and report them to the supervisor.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
8.1. Document the technical results in the laboratory information
system (LIS). 8.2. Review the technical staining results before
submission for pathological evaluation.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Interpretation of staining depends on the pathologist and the
diagnostic context in which the staining is employed.
