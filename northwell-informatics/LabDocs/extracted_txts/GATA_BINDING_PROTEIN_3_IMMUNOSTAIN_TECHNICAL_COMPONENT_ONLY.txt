STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES (SOP) FOR
ANALYTICAL PHASE OF GATA BINDING PROTEIN 3
IMMUNOSTAIN, TECHNICAL COMPONENT ONLY
1. PURPOSE
This protocol outlines the procedures for the technical analytical
phase of generating results for GATA Binding Protein 3 (GATA3)
immunostaining in the laboratory. The aim is to ensure consistent and
reliable results through standardized preparation, staining, and
quality control methods.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
Qualified laboratory personnel, under supervision and trained in
immunohistochemistry (IHC) techniques, are responsible for carrying
out the procedures described in this SOP. It is their duty to ensure
adherence to the protocol and promptly report any variances or
issues encountered during the analytical phase.
1. DEFINITIONS
GATA Binding Protein 3 (GATA3): A marker used in
immunohistochemistry to identify specific cell types, particularly in the
context of breast carcinoma and urothelial carcinoma.
Technical Component Only: Refers to the staining of tissue
specimens without the interpretation of the resultant
immunohistochemical staining patterns, which is to be done by a
certified pathologist.
1. MATERIALS AND REAGENTS
• GATA3 Primary Antibody (Ready-to-use or pre-diluted as per
manufacturer's instructions)
• Positive and Negative Control tissues
• Tissue Specimens (Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded)
• Automated IHC Stainer
• Detection Reagents and Substrates (as specified by the antibody
manufacturer)
• Mounting Medium
1. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Preparation
1. Ensure that tissue specimens are appropriately labeled with
patient ID, specimen ID, and collection date.
2. Cut tissue sections at 4–5 µm thickness using a microtome.
3. Place tissue sections onto positive-charged slides.
B. Deparaffinization and Rehydration
1. Deparaffinize the slides in xylene for 10 minutes.
2. Rehydrate through descending alcohols (100%, 95%, and 70%)
for 5 minutes each.
3. Wash slides in distilled water for 2 minutes.
C. Antigen Retrieval
1. Perform antigen retrieval according to the manufacturer's
guidelines (e.g., Heat-induced epitope retrieval using citrate or
EDTA buffer).
D. Immunostaining
1. Load slides onto an automated IHC stainer.
2. Apply the GATA3 primary antibody. Allow incubation as
specified by the antibody manufacturer (e.g., 30 minutes).
3. Follow with washing steps using PBS.
4. Apply secondary antibody and detection reagents/substrates.
Follow manufacturer's instructions for incubation times.
E. Counterstaining
1. Counterstain slides with hematoxylin.
2. Dehydrate through ascending alcohols and xylene.
F. Mounting
1. Mount coverslips using appropriate mounting medium.
2. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include positive and negative controls with each batch of slides
stained.
• Review stained control slides to ensure proper staining quality
before proceeding with patient samples.
1. RESULT DOCUMENTATION
• Document staining results in the laboratory's information system.
• Technologists should review and record any anomalies or
deviations observed during the staining process.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s product inserts for GATA3 antibody and detection
reagents.
• Internal laboratory guidelines for quality control and result
documentation.
