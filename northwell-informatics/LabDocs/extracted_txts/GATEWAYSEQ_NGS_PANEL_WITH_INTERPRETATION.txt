Standard Operating Procedure: GATEWAYSEQ NGS PANEL
WITH INTERPRETATION
1. PURPOSE To provide a standardized protocol for the analytical
phase in generating results for GATEWAYSEQ NGS Panel, including
data interpretation and reporting. This SOP ensures accuracy,
reproducibility, and consistency in the handling and processing of
next-generation sequencing data.
Responsibility: Designated staff members from the molecular
diagnostics team are responsible for performing the analytical phase,
documenting results, and conducting data interpretation as defined in
this SOP. It is the responsibility of the staff and supervisors to
recognize and address any deviations, ensuring procedural
compliance.
2. DEFINITION The GATEWAYSEQ NGS Panel is designed for
comprehensive sequencing and analysis of multiple genes. The
procedure includes qPCR, library preparation, sequencing, data
analysis, and interpretation.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Thermal cycler for PCR
• Magnetic beads for cleanup
• Library preparation kit
• NGS sequencer (e.g., Illumina platform)
• Bioinformatics software (e.g., BaseSpace, DNAnexus)
• Quality control materials and standard references
• Laboratory notebooks and electronic documentation tools
4. PROCEDURE
A) PCR Amplification: Preparation of Template DNA
1. Extract genomic DNA from the sample using a certified
extraction kit.
2. Quantify DNA using a fluorometer or spectrophotometer.
3. Normalize the DNA concentration to the desired level (typically
10-50 ng/μL).
PCR Reaction Setup
1. Prepare the PCR master mix according to the reagent
specifications.
2. Aliquot the master mix into PCR tubes or plates.
3. Add the template DNA samples to the tubes/plates.
4. Perform PCR amplification using the thermal cycler.
Protocols
• Follow thermal cycling conditions as specified in the
manufacturer's protocol for the PCR assays.
B) Library Preparation:
1. Fragment the amplified DNA using enzymatic or mechanical
methods.
2. Perform end repair and A-tailing as specified in the library
preparation kit instructions.
3. Ligate indexed adapters to the DNA fragments.
4. Purify the ligated products using magnetic beads.
5. Validate the library preparation by quantification and sizing
analysis.
C) Sequencing: Sequencing Setup
1. Load the purified libraries into the sequencer following the
platform-specific protocols.
2. Configure the sequencing run using the appropriate settings for
read length and pair-end sequencing.
3. Monitor the sequencing process for quality metrics and
completion.
D) Data Analysis:
1. Ensure the raw sequencing data is transferred to the secure
server equipped with bioinformatics software.
2. Process the data through the automated pipeline, including:
◦ Base calling
◦ Read alignment to reference genome
◦ Variant calling
◦ Annotation
Quality Control Metrics
• Base Quality Score: ≥ Q30 for over 85% of the bases.
• Read Coverage: Minimum depth of 20x (as specified for clinical
use).
• Alignment rate: Over 99% of reads should align to the reference
genome.
E) Interpretation:
1. Review variants identified in the sequencing data, cross-
referencing with clinical databases and literature.
2. Classify identified variants according to ACMG guidelines (e.g.,
pathogenic, likely pathogenic, VUS, benign).
3. Document findings and interpretations in the sample report.
F) Reporting Results:
1. Generate a laboratory report summarizing the sequencing
results, variant interpretation, and clinical relevance.
2. Verify the report against raw data for accuracy and
completeness.
3. Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
4. Provide the finalized report to the ordering physician for
integration into patient records.
5. QUALITY CONTROL Internal QC:
1. Run positive and negative controls alongside each batch of
samples to ensure assay reliability.
2. Record all metrics, deviations, and corrective actions in
electronic documentation tools.
Inter-lab QC:
1. Participate in external proficiency testing at regular intervals.
2. Compare inter-lab data and follow corrective actions for
discrepancies.
