Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Gaucher Disease Full
Gene Analysis
1. PURPOSE
To delineate the process for performing full gene analysis for
Gaucher Disease on patient genomic DNA samples, including steps
from DNA preparation, through sequencing, to data analysis, and
result reporting.
1. DEFINITION
Gaucher Disease is a lysosomal storage disorder caused by
mutations in the GBA gene leading to deficient activity of the enzyme
glucocerebrosidase.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
• Personnel performing the procedure must be trained in molecular
techniques and familiar with the equipment and reagents used.
• It is the responsibility of the laboratory supervisor to ensure the
quality of results and compliance with this SOP.
1. EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS
• DNA extraction kit
• NanoDrop spectrophotometer or Qubit fluorometer
• PCR reagents and thermal cycler
• Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) system
• Bioinformatics analysis software
• Gaucher Disease reference sequence
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen: Whole blood, extracted DNA, or any other tissue with
high-quality genomic DNA. Transportation: Blood should be
transported at 4°C or ambient temperature if it will be processed
immediately; extracted DNA should be transported at 4°C.
1. PROCEDURE
A. DNA Extraction
1. Use a validated DNA extraction kit to isolate genomic DNA from
patient samples.
2. Proceed with the extraction protocol as per the manufacturer's
instructions.
3. Measure the concentration and purity of the isolated DNA using
a NanoDrop spectrophotometer or Qubit fluorometer.
4. Ensure the DNA meets quality criteria: purity (A260/A280 ratio
of 1.8-2.0) and concentration (minimum concentration of 50 ng/
µL).
B. PCR Amplification
1. Design primers flanking the entire coding regions and exon-
intron boundaries of the GBA gene.
2. Prepare the PCR master mix according to the optimized
protocol, ensuring component volumes and concentrations are
correct.
3. Aliquot 50-100 ng of genomic DNA per PCR reaction tube.
4. Perform PCR in a thermal cycler with programmed conditions
specific to the GBA gene.
5. Verify amplification success by running an aliquot of PCR
product on an agarose gel.
C. Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) Preparation
1. Prepare the PCR products for sequencing by purifying the
amplicons using a validated cleanup method (e.g., bead-based
purification).
2. Quantify and assess the integrity of the purified amplicons.
3. Prepare the sequencing library according to the NGS system’s
library preparation protocol.
4. Load the library onto the sequencing platform and initiate the
run as per the manufacturer's instructions.
D. Bioinformatics Analysis
1. Use validated bioinformatics tools to align the raw sequencing
data to the reference GBA gene sequence.
2. Identify and annotate variants using appropriate software.
3. Validate the variants by checking quality metrics and ensuring
they are within acceptable thresholds.
E. Interpretation and Reporting
1. Review the annotated variants, focusing on those known to be
pathogenic or likely pathogenic.
2. Correlate the identified mutations with clinical manifestations of
Gaucher Disease.
3. Compile a final report summarizing the results, including the
identified variants with their pathogenic potential and any
relevant clinical correlations.
4. Ensure the report undergoes peer review by a board-certified
geneticist or pathologist for accuracy and clinical relevance.
5. QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE
• Include positive and negative controls through each step of the
process to ensure the integrity of the results.
• Perform regular maintenance and calibration of all equipment
used.
• Ensure compliance with internal and external quality assurance
programs, including proficiency testing.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
Results are reviewed and verified by a technologist and board-
certified geneticist/pathologist before being transmitted to the
requesting clinician. Reports should include a detailed description of
testing methodologies, identified variants with interpretations, and
recommendations for genetic counseling or further testing if
necessary.

software used in the analysis process.
1. REVISIONS AND UPDATES
This SOP will be reviewed annually or when significant procedural
changes occur to maintain accuracy and compliance with current
guidelines and technology advancements.
This SOP ensures a systematic and detailed approach to conducting
full gene analysis for Gaucher Disease, maintaining high standards
for accuracy, reproducibility, and reliability in genetic testing.
