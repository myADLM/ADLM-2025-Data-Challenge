STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP)
GCDFP-15 IMMUNOSTAIN, TECHNICAL COMPONENT ONLY
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for performing the technical
component of GCDFP-15 (Gross Cystic Disease Fluid Protein-15)
immunostain in tissue samples. This SOP ensures consistent and
reliable results across laboratory personnel performing the assay.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing the
GCDFP-15 immunostain following this procedure. It is the
responsibility of all laboratory personnel to report any issues that may
affect the quality or accuracy of the test to a supervisor immediately.
1. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory staff involved in the technical
processing of tissue samples for GCDFP-15 immunostain.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
◦ Preferred Specimen: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded
(FFPE) tissue blocks.
◦ Specimen Acceptance Criteria: Specimens must be
properly labeled with patient identification and must have
accompanying requisition forms with pertinent clinical
information.
◦ Unacceptable Specimens: Specimens that are not
properly fixed, inadequately labeled, or not accompanied by
proper documentation will not be processed.
2. REAGENTS, EQUIPMENT, AND SUPPLIES
◦ Reagents:
▪ Primary antibody: Anti-GCDFP-15, ready-to-use
▪ Secondary antibody: Horseradish Peroxidase (HRP)-
conjugated
▪ Chromogen: 3,3'-Diaminobenzidine (DAB)
▪ Counterstain: Hematoxylin
▪ Mounting medium
◦ Equipment:
▪ Microtome
▪ Water bath
▪ Slide racks
▪ Hot plate or oven
▪ Humidified chamber
◦ Supplies:
▪ Microscope slides
▪ Cover slips
▪ Wash buffer (e.g., phosphate-buffered saline, PBS)
▪ Blocking solution
3. PROCEDURE
5.1 Sectioning and Slide Preparation
◦ Cut 4-5 µm sections from FFPE blocks using a microtome.
◦ Place sections on positively charged microscope slides.
◦ Dry slides on a hot plate at 60°C for 30 minutes or in a 37°C
oven overnight.
5.2 Deparaffinization and Rehydration
◦ Deparaffinize slides by immersing in xylene (three changes,
5 minutes each).
◦ Rehydrate in a series of ethanol solutions (100%, 95%,
80%, and 70%) for 2 minutes each.
◦ Rinse slides in distilled water.
5.3 Antigen Retrieval
◦ Perform antigen retrieval using a pressure cooker or
microwave. Place slides in citrate buffer (pH 6.0) or as
specified by the primary antibody manufacturer.
◦ Heat slides for 20 minutes.
◦ Allow slides to cool to room temperature (RT), then rinse in
distilled water, followed by wash buffer (PBS).
5.4 Blocking and Primary Antibody Incubation
◦ Block endogenous peroxidase activity by incubating slides
in 3% hydrogen peroxide in methanol for 10 minutes at RT.
◦ Rinse slides in wash buffer (PBS).
◦ Apply blocking solution to prevent non-specific binding (e.g.,
5% normal serum) for 10 minutes.
◦ Incubate slides with primary antibody (anti-GCDFP-15) at
the dilution recommended by the manufacturer for 30
minutes at RT in a humidified chamber.
◦ Rinse slides with wash buffer (PBS) three times, 2 minutes
each.
5.5 Secondary Antibody and Chromogen Reaction
◦ Apply HRP-conjugated secondary antibody and incubate for
30 minutes at RT.
◦ Rinse slides with wash buffer (PBS) three times, 2 minutes
each.
◦ Prepare DAB chromogen solution according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Apply DAB solution to slides and monitor development
under a microscope for 5-10 minutes or until satisfactory
staining is achieved.
◦ Rinse slides in distilled water.
5.6 Counterstaining and Mounting
◦ Counterstain slides with hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes.
◦ Rinse in tap water and differentiate in 0.3% acid alcohol,
followed by bluing in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).
◦ Dehydrate slides through 70%, 80%, 95%, and 100%
ethanol solutions.
◦ Clear slides in xylene and mount with resinous mounting
medium covering with cover slips.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Include appropriate positive and negative control slides with
each run.
◦ Document all steps, including incubation times, reagent lot
numbers, and conditions.
◦ Inspect stained slides under a microscope to ensure the
expected staining patterns.
5. REPORTING
◦ Forward all stained slides to the pathologist for
interpretation.
◦ Document any deviations from the protocol and
communicate any issues to the supervisor.
6. REFERENCE RANGES
◦ Interpretation of the immunostain results will be done by a
pathologist, and reference ranges are determined based on
pathological evaluation.

◦ Manufacturer’s instructions for GCDFP-15 antibody,
secondary antibody, and DAB chromogen.

guidelines.
