Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for GD1A Antibody
1. PURPOSE
This SOP provides detailed instructions for the analytical procedures
involved in generating results for GD1A antibody testing in the
laboratory. The goal is to ensure accurate, reliable, and reproducible
results.
Responsibility:
The designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing and
documenting all the steps involved in the analysis of GD1A antibody
as defined in this procedure. Staff must ensure adherence to this
SOP and report any issues to the supervisor.
1. DEFINITION
GD1A Antibody Analysis involves detecting the presence of
antibodies against GD1A gangliosides which are biomarkers for
certain neurological disorders.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
• Specimen Type: Serum
• Preferred Collection Container: Serum separator tube (SST)
• Minimum Volume Required: 0.5 mL serum
• Stability:
◦ At room temperature (15-25°C): 24 hours
◦ Refrigerated (2-8°C): 7 days
◦ Frozen (-20°C or colder): 2 months
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND MATERIALS
• ELISA reader
• Appropriate ELISA kit for GD1A antibody detection
• Micropipettes and tips
• Plate washer
• Calibrated timer
• Deionized or distilled water
• Absorbent paper towels
• Laboratory coat, disposable gloves, and safety glasses
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Utilize both positive and negative controls with each set of
specimens processed.
• Control results must fall within the specified range provided by the
ELISA kit manufacturer.
• Document all QC results, and if any control fails, the test results
must not be released and troubleshooting must be initiated.
1. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation:
1. Bring all reagents and specimens to room temperature before
use.
2. Calibrate the ELISA reader as per manufacturer instructions.
3. Ensure all equipment is clean and operate under specified
environmental conditions (temperature: 20-25°C, humidity:
30-60%).
B) Assay Procedure:
1. Coating of Plate:
◦ If using a pre-coated plate, skip this step.
◦ Coating buffer containing GD1A antigen is added to each
well and incubated overnight at 4°C.
2. Blocking:
◦ Add blocking buffer to each well and incubate for 1 hour at
room temperature to prevent non-specific binding.
3. Adding Samples and Controls:
◦ Dilute patient serum samples as specified by the kit
manufacturer.
◦ Add diluted samples, positive control, negative control, and
blank to the appropriate wells.
◦ Incubate for 1 hour at room temperature.
4. Washing:
◦ Wash each well with the wash buffer, typically three times,
to remove unbound antibodies.
5. Adding Conjugate:
◦ Add enzyme-conjugated secondary antibody to each well
and incubate for 30-60 minutes at room temperature.
6. Washing:
◦ Repeat the wash step to remove any unbound conjugate.
7. Substrate Addition:
◦ Add substrate solution to each well and incubate for the
specified time (usually 10-30 minutes) or until a color
change is observed.
8. Stop Reaction:
◦ Add stop solution to each well. This will change the color to
yellow and stop the enzymatic reaction.
9. Reading the Plate:
◦ Read the absorbance of each well at the specified
wavelength using the ELISA reader (commonly 450 nm with
a reference at 620-630 nm).
C) Interpretation:
1. Calculate the results using either a standard curve or
comparison to controls depending on the kit instructions.
2. Determine whether the GD1A antibody levels in the patient
samples are positive or negative based on the cutoff value
established by the kit.
D) Documentation and Reporting:
1. Document all raw data, including sample IDs, absorbance
values, control results, and calculated results.
2. Review and verify results before release.
3. Report results as either "Positive", "Negative", or "Inconclusive"
(if retesting is required).
4. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results are to be entered in the Laboratory Information System
(LIS) and must be reviewed and approved by the designated
laboratory technologist.
• Results should be reported with the relevant interpretive
comments according to site-specific guidelines.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS AND TROUBLESHOOTING
• The presence of hemolysis, lipemia, or icterus in serum
specimens may interfere with the assay results.
• Ensure that all pipetting steps are done accurately to avoid errors.
• Follow manufacturer instructions for troubleshooting any errors or
unexpected results.
