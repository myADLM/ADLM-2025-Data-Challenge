Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Testing of
Glucosylceramidase (GD1B) - Immunoglobulin M (IGM)
1. PURPOSE
This SOP provides the protocol for the analytical phase of generating
results for Glucosylceramidase (GD1B) - Immunoglobulin M (IGM) in
a clinical laboratory setting. The purpose is to ensure consistency,
accuracy, and reliability of results while maintaining compliance with
regulatory requirements.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
2.1 Preferred Specimen
• Serum: At least 2 mL of serum collected in a serum separator
tube (SST).
• Plasma: 2 mL plasma collected in an EDTA or heparin tube.
2.2 Unacceptable Specimens
• Specimens not properly labeled or without clear collection dates.
• Specimens exposed to extreme temperatures or not stored
properly during transport.
• Specimens with evident hemolysis.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• High sensitivity enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit
specific for GD1B (IGM)
• Calibrated micropipettes and tips
• Plate reader calibrated for the specific ELISA (405 nm, 450 nm or
wavelength specified by the kit manufacturer)
• Deionized water
• Reagent-grade chemicals and solutions as recommended by the
kit manufacturer
• Personal protective equipment (PPE) including gloves, lab coat,
and safety goggles
• Laboratory timer
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run quality control samples (high control, low control, and
negative/blank control) with every batch of patient samples.
• Ensure all equipment is calibrated according to the
manufacturer’s specifications before use.
• Record all quality control checks and corrective actions, if any, in
the quality control log.
1. PROCEDURE
5.1 Preparation
1. Allow all reagents, controls, and samples to reach room
temperature (18-25°C) before starting the assay.
2. Prepare all reagents as per the ELISA kit manufacturer's
instructions.
3. Label strips or microwells appropriately based on the number of
samples and quality controls being tested.
5.2 Assay Procedure
1. Add 100 µL of each standard, control, and patient sample into
designated wells.
2. Add 50 µL of horseradish peroxidase conjugate reagent to each
well.
3. Cover the plate with adhesive seal and incubate at 37°C for 60
minutes.
4. After incubation, wash the wells with the specified wash buffer
(typically 3-5 washing cycles).
5. Add 100 µL of TMB (tetramethylbenzidine) substrate to each
well. Incubate the plate in the dark at room temperature for 15
minutes.
6. Add 50 µL of stop solution to each well.
7. Read the absorbance at 450 nm using a plate reader within 30
minutes of adding the stop solution.
5.3 Data Analysis
1. Generate a standard curve by plotting the optical density (O.D.)
values against the concentration of the standards.
2. Use the standard curve to calculate the GD1B (IGM)
concentrations in patient samples and controls.
3. Ensure that the assay is valid by confirming that the O.D.
values for the controls fall within the expected range as
specified in the kit insert.
4. REPORTING RESULTS
5. Document all data in the appropriate format, ensuring that all
patient information is anonymized for data entry purposes.
6. Review and verify results by comparing with established
reference ranges.
7. Report results in the laboratory information system (LIS),
ensuring accurate and clear communication to the requesting
clinician.
8. Flag and take necessary actions on any results falling outside
of the normal or critical range according to laboratory policy.
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the ELISA kit manufacturer’s insert for specific information
on method limitations, potential interferences, and cross-reactivity.
