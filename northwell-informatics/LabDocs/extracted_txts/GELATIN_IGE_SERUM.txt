Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical
Phase of GELATIN, IGE, SERUM
1. Purpose:
To provide detailed and standardized procedures for the analysis of
serum IgE and gelatin-specific IgE levels in the laboratory, ensuring
accurate and consistent results.
2. Scope:
This SOP applies to all personnel performing serum IgE and gelatin-
specific IgE testing in the laboratory.
3. Responsibilities:
• Laboratory Technologists: Responsible for performing the tests
according to this SOP and documenting all results.
• Supervisors: Ensure that all personnel are trained in this SOP
and monitor compliance. Address any deviations or issues in the
testing process.
• Quality Control Officer: Ensure that all quality control measures
are followed, review QC results, and address any issues that
arise.
4. Specimen:
Acceptable Sample Types:
• Serum: 2-3 mL of patient serum collected in a red or gold-top
tube.
Specimen Stability:
• Room temperature: 8 hours
• Refrigerated (2-8°C): 72 hours
• Frozen (-20°C or colder): Indefinitely, provided the sample is not
thawed and refrozen.
Unacceptable Samples:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
• Samples that are not properly labeled with the patient’s
identification and collection date/time.
5. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies:
• Equipment:
◦ Centrifuge
◦ Refrigerated storage
◦ ELISA Reader (for IgE quantification)
◦ Pipettes (and appropriate tips)
◦ Incubator set at 37°C
• Reagents:
◦ Human serum controls (Low, Medium, High)
◦ Washing buffer
◦ Substrate solution for ELISA
◦ Stop solution for ELISA
• Supplies:
◦ 96-well ELISA plates
◦ Microcentrifuge tubes
◦ Plate sealers
6. Procedures:
A. Sample Preparation:
1. Centrifuge the serum samples at 3000 RPM for 10 minutes to
separate the serum.
2. Aliquot the required amount of serum into appropriately labeled
microcentrifuge tubes if not analyzed immediately.
3. Store aliquots at 2-8°C if analysis is within 72 hours; otherwise,
store at -20°C.
B. Reagent Preparation:
1. Prepare all reagents according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
2. Bring all reagents and samples to room temperature before
starting the procedure.
C. ELISA Procedure for Total IgE:
1. Coating:
◦ Coat the wells of a 96-well plate with the specific IgE
capture antibody diluted in coating buffer.
◦ Incubate the plate overnight at 4°C.
2. Washing:
◦ Wash the plate 3 times with washing buffer.
3. Blocking:
◦ Add blocking buffer to each well and incubate for 1 hour at
room temperature.
4. Sample/Application:
◦ Add 100 μL of standard, control, or patient serum samples
into respective wells.
◦ Incubate the plate for 2 hours at room temperature.
5. Detection:
◦ Add 100 μL of the biotin-labeled detection antibody to each
well.
◦ Incubate the plate for 1 hour at room temperature.
6. Streptavidin-HRP:
◦ Add 100 μL of streptavidin-HRP to each well.
◦ Incubate the plate for 30 minutes at room temperature away
from light.
7. Substrate:
◦ Add 100 μL of the substrate solution to each well.
◦ Incubate the plate for 15-30 minutes or until the standard
curves are developed sufficiently.
8. Stopping:
◦ Add 50 μL of stop solution to each well.
9. Reading:
◦ Read the absorbance within 5 minutes at 450 nm with a
reference wavelength of 570 nm.
D. Calculation of Results:
1. Construct a standard curve using the absorbance values of the
known standards.
2. Use the standard curve to calculate the concentration of IgE in
patient samples.
3. Report the results according to the lab’s reporting format,
ensuring all data is reviewed and verified by a technologist.
7. Quality Control:
• Control Levels:
◦ Include low, medium, and high controls in each run.
• Acceptance Criteria:
◦ Controls must fall within the pre-determined acceptable range
stated by the manufacturer. If controls are out of range, do not
report patient results until the issue is resolved.
8. Troubleshooting:
• Plate Washing:
◦ Ensure sufficient washing to avoid high background.
• Reagent Handling:
◦ Follow all reagent preparation and storage instructions to
maintain reagent integrity.
• Sample Handling:
◦ Ensure samples are free from hemolysis and properly stored
before analysis.
9. Reporting Results:
• Enter and verify results in the laboratory information system (LIS).
• Notify physicians of any critical values immediately and document
accordingly.
10. Safety and Waste Disposal:
• Follow all laboratory safety protocols for handling biological
specimens.
• Dispose of all biohazard and chemical waste according to local
regulations.

• Manufacturer’s Instructions for use of reagents and equipment.
• CLSI Guidelines for immunoassay methods.
