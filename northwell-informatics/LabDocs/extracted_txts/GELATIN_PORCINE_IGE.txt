SOP for Analytical Phase of Generating Results for Gelatin Porcine
IgE
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the procedure for analyzing and generating results
for Gelatin Porcine IgE levels in patient specimens. Ensuring the
accuracy and reliability of results, monitoring quality control, and
maintaining standard practices throughout the analytical process are
key principles of this protocol.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
All designated laboratory personnel conducting the analysis must
adhere to this SOP. It is the responsibility of laboratory management
to ensure that staff are properly trained and that this procedure is
followed and documented appropriately.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred Specimen:
• Serum: 1-2 mL of serum collected in a red-top or serum-
separating tube (SST).
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Plasma or whole blood specimens are not acceptable.
• Hemolyzed or lipemic specimens should be avoided.
Specimen Handling:
• Serum specimens should be separated from cells within 2 hours
of collection.
• Store specimens at 2-8°C if analysis is to be conducted within 48
hours, or freeze at -20°C for longer storage.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
Equipment:
• ELISA Reader capable of reading at 450 nm with a reference
wavelength of 620 nm.
• Micropipettes and tips.
• Vortex mixer.
• Plate washer (automated or manual).
• Incubator at 37°C.
Reagents:
• Gelatin Porcine IgE ELISA kit.
• Deionized or distilled water.
• Quality control material (low and high controls).
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation of Reagents:
• Prepare all reagents according to the manufacturer's instructions
provided with the ELISA kit.
• Bring all reagents and samples to room temperature before use.
B. Sample Preparation:
• Ensure all serum samples, calibrators, and controls are ready for
use, and bring to room temperature.
• Mix samples well by vortexing before testing.
C. Assay Protocol:
1. Add 100 µL of standards, controls, and patient serum samples
to the respective wells of the ELISA plate.
2. Incubate the plate for 60 minutes at 37°C.
3. Wash the plate five times with the prepared wash buffer.
4. Add 100 µL of enzyme-labeled antibody to each well.
5. Incubate the plate for 30 minutes at 37°C.
6. Wash the plate again for five times.
7. Add 100 µL of the substrate solution to each well and incubate
for 10-15 minutes at room temperature in the dark.
8. Add 50 µL of stop solution to each well.
9. Read the plate at 450 nm with a reference wavelength of 620
nm using the ELISA reader.
D. Data Analysis:
• Generate a standard curve from the calibrators.
• Calculate the concentration of Gelatin Porcine IgE in the patient
samples using the standard curve.
• Ensure all QC controls are within the acceptable range before
reporting patient results.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run quality controls (low and high) with each batch of tests.
• Record the results of the controls in the QC log.
• Investigate and resolve any QC failures before proceeding with
patient result reporting.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results of patient samples must be reviewed and verified by the
technologist.
• Report results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS) and
ensure proper documentation is done.
• Reference intervals and critical values should be established and
used according to lab-specific guidelines.
1. RECORD-KEEPING AND DOCUMENTATION
• Maintain records of all sample accessioning, reagent preparation,
and QC logs.
• Document all results, including any deviations from the SOP and
their resolution.
• Store all documents as per laboratory policies and regulatory
requirements.

1. REVISION HISTORY
• Version 1.0: Initial creation (October 2023).
This document should be reviewed and updated as necessary to
comply with new developments and regulatory requirements.
