Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase Procedure for Generating Results for General
Factor Bethesda Units (BU), Plasma
1. Purpose
This SOP describes the procedure for the analytical phase of
generating results for General Factor Bethesda Units (BU) in plasma,
ensuring accurate and reliable results in compliance with regulatory
requirements and laboratory standards.
1. Scope
This procedure applies to all staff trained and authorized to perform
the Bethesda Assay in the laboratory setting.
1. Responsibility
• Medical Laboratory Scientists (MLS) are responsible for
performing the assay, recording data, and ensuring quality control.
• Supervisors are responsible for reviewing results, ensuring
compliance with the protocol, and addressing any non-
conformance issues.
1. Equipment and Reagents
• Platelet-poor plasma (PPP) specimen
• Factor VIII-deficient plasma
• Normal pooled plasma (NPP) or recombinant Factor VIII
• Bethesda buffer
• Incubation water bath (37°C)
• Coagulometer or clotting time apparatus
• Pipettes and tips
• Microcentrifuge tubes (1.5mL)
• Calibration and control materials specific to the assay
1. Specimen Handling and Preparation
• Ensure that the PPP specimen has been properly collected,
labeled, and accessioned before initiating the assay.
• Preferred plasma specimens should be centrifuged at a minimum
of 1,500 x g for 15 minutes to obtain PPP.
• Store the plasma at -20°C or lower if not analyzed immediately.
Thaw plasma specimens rapidly at 37°C prior to analysis and use
promptly.
1. Procedure
A. Pre-Analysis Checks
• Verify calibration of the coagulometer and ensure it is within
acceptable limits.
• Perform quality control checks using calibration and control
materials. Document these checks.
B. Bethesda Assay Setup
1. Prepare a 1:1 mixture of patient plasma and NPP or
recombinant Factor VIII.
◦ Mix 100 µL of patient plasma with 100 µL of NPP into a
microcentrifuge tube.
2. Prepare a control mixture using NPP and Factor VIII-deficient
plasma.
◦ Mix 100 µL of NPP with 100 µL of Factor VIII-deficient
plasma into a separate microcentrifuge tube.
3. Incubate both mixtures at 37°C for 2 hours.
C. Clotting Time Measurement
1. After incubation, measure the residual Factor VIII activity using
a one-stage clotting assay.
2. Set up coagulometer following manufacturer instructions.
3. Pipette 100 µL of the incubated mixture into the coagulometer
cuvette.
4. Initiate the clotting assay and record the clotting time.
5. Repeat steps B and C for the control mixture.
D. Calculating Bethesda Units
1. Calculate the residual Factor VIII activity for both patient and
control samples.
◦ Use the formula: Residual Activity (%) = (Clotting time of test
mixture / Clotting time of control mixture) * 100
2. Convert residual activity to Bethesda Units using the
standardized Bethesda assay table:
◦ % Residual Activity vs. Bethesda Unit Conversion Chart
◦ Example: 50% Residual Activity = 1 Bethesda Unit.
3. Reporting Results
• Record the final results in Bethesda Units in the Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
• Ensure that the results are reviewed and validated by the
supervisor before releasing to the patient’s medical record.
• Document any anomalies or deviations encountered during the
assay in the laboratory log.
1. Quality Control
• Perform QC assays in parallel with patient samples as per
laboratory protocol.
• Monitor assay performance by participating in external proficiency
testing and inter-laboratory comparisons.
• Investigate and rectify any discrepancies or failures in QC
processes immediately.
1. Limitations
• Specimen integrity is critical; ensure proper handling to avoid
hemolysis or contamination.
• Results can be affected by improper incubation times and
temperatures.
1. References
• Refer to the published literature on the Bethesda Assay for Factor
Inhibitors for detailed methodology and conversion charts.
• Follow manufacturer instructions for all equipment and reagents
used in the assay.
1. Revisions
• Document any modifications to this SOP and update as needed,
ensuring that all staff are trained on the revised protocol.
