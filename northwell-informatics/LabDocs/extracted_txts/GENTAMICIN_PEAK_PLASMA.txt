1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this protocol is to outline the procedures for
processing and analyzing peak plasma samples for gentamicin levels
to ensure accurate and reliable results.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred Specimen:
• Draw 5 mL of blood into a plasma separator tube (PST) or
heparinized green-top tube.
• Ensure that the peak plasma collection is timed appropriately,
generally 30 minutes after the end of the infusion of gentamicin.
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Hemolyzed samples due to the potential release of intracellular
contents that could interfere with the assay.
• Specimens in tubes containing anticoagulants other than heparin
(e.g., EDTA, citrate) which are not validated for this assay.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Gentamicin assay reagent kit (validated and within expiration
date)
• Calibrators and controls (Expiration date checked)
• Plasma separator tubes (PST) or heparinized green-top tubes
• Centrifuge
• Micropipettes and tips
• Analytical system (e.g., HPLC, immunoassay analyzer)
• Laboratory logbook or Laboratory Information Management
System (LIMS)
1. PROCEDURE
4.1 Specimen Handling:
• Verify that the sample has been properly labeled with patient
identification and time of collection.
• Inspect the sample for any signs of hemolysis. If hemolysis is
detected, reject the sample and request a new one.
• Centrifuge the blood sample at 2000-3000 g for 10-15 minutes to
separate plasma.
• Pipette the plasma into a secondary labeled tube without
disturbing the cell layer.
4.2 Assay Preparation:
• Refer to the reagent kit insert for specific preparation steps for the
gentamicin assay reagents, calibrators, and controls.
• Prepare calibrators and controls as recommended by the
manufacturer.
• Set up the analyzer using the gentamicin-specific assay
parameters provided in the reagent kit insert.
4.3 Assay Execution:
• Load the prepared plasma samples, calibrators, and controls onto
the analyzer according to the instrument's loading guidelines.
• Start the assay run on the analyzer following the manufacturer’s
instructions.
• Record the data generated by the analyzer in the laboratory
logbook or LIMS.
4.4 Interpretation of Results:
• Ensure that the calibration curve and quality control results meet
the acceptance criteria defined in the reagent kit insert.
• Review the gentamicin levels obtained for each sample against
the established therapeutic and toxic ranges. Reference Intervals:
◦ Therapeutic Peak Concentrations:
▪ Typically 5-10 µg/mL for conventional dosing
▪ Typically 20-30 µg/mL for once-daily dosing regimens
◦ Critical Results:
▪ Any result above the therapeutic range should be
immediately brought to the attention of the ordering
physician.
4.5 Reporting Results:
• Verify all results by comparing with the control and calibration
data.
• Record and validate the patient results in the LIMS, ensuring
entry accuracy.
• Electronically or manually transmit the verified results to the
ordering clinician or representative healthcare provider.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Routine Calibrator and Control Runs:
◦ Run controls and calibrators with each batch of patient
samples.
◦ Ensure that the control results fall within the acceptable
ranges; otherwise, troubleshoot according to the analyzer’s
manual.
• Documentation of QC:
◦ Document all processes, observations, and any deviations
from the standard procedure in the laboratory logbook or
LIMS.
◦ Investigate and rectify any out-of-control situations before
reporting patient results.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If control values fall outside acceptable ranges, repeat the assay.
• In case of persistent issues, recalibrate the analyzer, prepare
fresh reagents, and re-run the control samples.
• Consult the instrument manual or contact technical support as
necessary.
