Standard Operating Procedure for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Gentamicin, Peak, Serum
1. PURPOSE
To standardize the procedure for performing peak serum gentamicin
testing, ensuring accuracy, reliability, and reproducibility of results
that guide appropriate therapeutic interventions.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel responsible for the
analysis of peak serum gentamicin levels in a CLIA-certified
laboratory.
3. DEFINITIONS
Peak Serum Gentamicin Level: The highest concentration of
gentamicin in the blood measured after the administration of a dose
to assess therapeutic levels and avoid toxicity.
4. RESPONSIBILITY
• Laboratory Scientists: Conduct the analysis, monitor quality
controls, and validate results.
• Supervisors: Ensure adherence to SOP, oversee troubleshooting,
and validate corrective actions.
• Quality Control Coordinators: Manage the QC processes and
documentation.
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen Type:
• Serum.
Collection Requirements:
• Blood should be collected 30 minutes after the end of an
intravenous infusion of gentamicin.
• Use a plain red-top or serum separator tube (SST).
Specimen Transport and Storage:
• Centrifuge and separate serum within 2 hours of collection.
• Store serum at 2-8°C if analysis is to be performed within 72
hours.
• For long-term storage, freeze serum at -20°C or colder.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens collected in anticoagulant tubes (e.g., EDTA, heparin,
citrate).
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric specimens.
• Specimens stored at room temperature for more than 2 hours
prior to centrifugation.
6. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Centrifuge.
• Serum separator tubes (SST) / plain red-top tubes.
• Kit for gentamicin analysis (e.g., enzyme immunoassay or
chemiluminescent assay).
• Calibrators and controls for gentamicin.
• Micropipettes and tips.
• Analyzer (compatible with the chosen method).
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run quality control samples (low, medium, and high) with every
batch of patient samples.
• Document and verify all QC results before reporting patient
results.
• Take corrective actions if any QC result is out of range. All
corrective actions must be documented.
8. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Allow frozen serum samples to thaw at room temperature.
2. Mix all specimens gently but thoroughly without causing
frothing.
Calibration and Quality Control:
1. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for calibrator preparation.
2. Run the calibrators and ensure the calibration curve meets the
requirements.
3. Run quality control samples and verify that all levels are within
the acceptable range.
Sample Analysis:
1. Set up the analyzer according to the manufacturer's guidelines.
2. Pipette the required volume of calibrators, controls, and patient
samples into designated wells.
3. Add the appropriate reagents according to the kit instructions.
Incubation and Measurement:
1. Follow the kit instructions for incubating the samples.
2. Measure the absorbance or chemiluminescence according to
the analyzer’s instructions.
3. Enter the raw data into the system to generate results.
Result Validation:
1. Compare patient sample results with established reference
ranges:
◦ Therapeutic range for peak serum gentamicin: 5-10 μg/mL
(range may vary based on lab policy).
2. Review QC data to ensure validity before validating patient
results.
3. Document any deviations and corrective actions taken.
Reporting Results:
1. Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
2. Verify accuracy and release results according to laboratory
protocol.
3. Notify the clinician of critical results according to the repeat
critical values protocol.
9. TROUBLESHOOTING
• Check and document reagent lot numbers and expiration dates.
• Ensure all equipment is functioning properly and calibrated.
• Repeat analysis if QC fails or if there is any indication of technical
error.
• Consult a supervisor for persistent issues or anomalies.
10. LIMITATIONS
• Avoid performing tests on non-serum specimens.
• Ensure proper timing of specimen collection to avoid misleading
results.
• Interferences such as hemolysis, lipemia, and bilirubinemia can
affect results accuracy.

monitoring.
