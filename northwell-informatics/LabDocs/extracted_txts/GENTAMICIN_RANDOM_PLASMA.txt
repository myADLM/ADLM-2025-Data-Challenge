1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the analysis of gentamicin
levels in random plasma samples to ensure accurate and reliable
results.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel involved in the
analysis of gentamicin levels in plasma using the designated
instrumentation and reagents.
3. RESPONSIBILITIES
• It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory personnel to
perform and document the analysis of gentamicin in plasma
samples.
• It is the responsibility of supervisors to ensure that laboratory
personnel are adequately trained and follow the defined
procedures.
• All staff must ensure that any deviations from this procedure are
reported immediately to the supervisor for corrective action.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
4.1 Specimen Type
• Preferred specimen: Plasma collected in an EDTA tube.
• Alternative specimen: Plasma collected in a lithium heparin tube
is acceptable.
4.2 Specimen Handling and Stability
• After collection, samples should be transported to the laboratory
at room temperature.
• Plasma should be separated from cells within 2 hours of collection
by centrifugation.
• Separated plasma should be stored at 2-8°C if analysis is delayed
and should be performed within 24 hours. If storage longer than
24 hours is needed, samples should be frozen at -20°C or lower.
4.3 Unacceptable Specimens
• Samples collected in sodium heparin, citrate, or fluoride/oxalate
tubes.
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples which could interfere with
the assay.
• Samples that have not been properly labeled or specimens
without proper identification.
5. EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS
• Analytical Instrument: Designated automated immunoassay or
HPLC system per laboratory standard.
• Reagents: Manufacturer's reagents specific for the determination
of gentamicin in plasma.
• Calibrators: Provided by the reagent manufacturer and traceable
to gentamicin standards.
• Quality Control (QC) Material: At least two levels of control
materials (low and high) that span the clinically relevant range of
gentamicin concentrations.
6. PROCEDURE
6.1 Preparation
• Verify that all required supplies, reagents, and calibrators are
within their expiration dates and have been stored according to
manufacturer recommendations.
• Turn on the analytical instrument and allow to warm up as
required by the manufacturer's protocol.
• Prepare calibrators and quality control materials according to
manufacturer’s instructions.
6.2 Calibration
• Perform instrument calibration using calibrators provided by the
manufacturer.
• Calibration should be performed following the manufacturer’s
guidelines or when there is a change in reagent lot numbers,
following instrument maintenance, or as required by laboratory
quality control standards.
• Document calibration results and ensure that they meet the
acceptance criteria before proceeding with sample analysis.
6.3 Quality Control
• Run quality control materials at the beginning of each analytical
run, after calibration, and at the end of the batch.
• Document QC results and review for acceptability using
laboratory-defined criteria before analyzing patient samples.
• If QC results are out of the acceptable range, investigate and
resolve the issue before proceeding with patient sample analysis.
6.4 Analytical Measurement
• Allow samples to reach room temperature before analysis.
• Load the plasma samples onto the appropriate racks or carousels
according to the instrument’s requirements.
• Enter sample IDs or scan barcodes if available to ensure proper
identification and traceability.
• Follow the manufacturer’s operating instructions to run the
samples on the instrument.
• Document the start time and any relevant observations.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
7.1 Result Verification
• Once the analysis is completed, review all results for validity,
including instrument flags that may indicate potential errors.
• Perform any necessary repeat testing if the initial results are
flagged or if QC material exhibits unacceptable values.
7.2 Critical Values
• Critical gentamicin levels must be defined by the laboratory’s
medical director and included in the SOP.
• Any critical values must be promptly reported to the requesting
physician or clinical team following the laboratory’s policy for
communication of critical results.
7.3 Documentation
• Enter the results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS) and
review them for accuracy.
• Verify that all QC and calibration data associated with the patient
results are within acceptable ranges.
• Maintain all logs of instrument calibration, maintenance, and QC
results according to laboratory policy.
8. QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE
• Participate in external proficiency testing programs specific to
gentamicin assay if available.
• Regularly review and update this standard operating procedure in
compliance with the latest guidelines and instrument
manufacturer recommendations.
• Implement continuous quality improvement measures based on
QC data and proficiency testing outcomes.
