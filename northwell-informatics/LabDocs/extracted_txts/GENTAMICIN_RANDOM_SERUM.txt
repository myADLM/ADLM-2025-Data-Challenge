SOP for Analytical Phase of Generating Results for GENTAMICIN,
RANDOM, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for accurately generating and reporting
results for Gentamicin levels in random serum samples.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing the
analysis, documenting results, and adhering to this SOP.
1. DEFINITION
Gentamicin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic used to treat various
bacterial infections. Monitoring serum levels is crucial to optimize
therapeutic effectiveness and minimize toxicity.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Centrifuge
• Serum separator tubes (SST)
• Laboratory Balance
• Analytical pipettes
• Gentamicin assay kit (specific brand and lot number)
• Calibrators and controls (low, medium, high)
• Analyzer (specify model and manufacturer)
• Quality control materials
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENT
Preferred/acceptable:
• 5 mL serum specimen collected in an SST.
• Specimen should be processed and separated within 2 hours of
collection.
• Store specimens at 2-8°C if analysis will be performed within 24
hours; otherwise, freeze at -20°C.
Unacceptable:
• Hemolyzed specimens.
• Specimens collected in anticoagulant tubes other than SST.
• Specimens stored at room temperature for more than 2 hours
after collection.
1. PROCEDURE
A. PRE-ANALYTICAL PHASE
1. Verify that the specimen meets the acceptance criteria.
2. Centrifuge the specimen for 10 minutes at 1,500-2,000g.
3. Carefully separate the serum from the clot and transfer it to a
labeled, clean tube.
B. ANALYTICAL PHASE
1. Calibrator and Control Preparation:
◦ Prepare calibrators and controls according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Verify that all have been stored
correctly and check expiration dates.
2. Instrument Calibration:
◦ Perform a calibration of the analyzer using prepared
calibrators.
◦ Verify that calibration meets the manufacturer’s specified
criteria before proceeding with sample analysis.
3. Sample Analysis:
◦ Allow all reagents, calibrators, and controls to come to room
temperature.
◦ Load the analyzer with sufficient volumes of calibrators,
controls, and samples.
◦ Input sample identification information into the analyzer’s
interface.
◦ Begin the analytical run according to the analyzer’s
operational manual.
4. Quality Control:
◦ Run low, medium, and high control samples in parallel with
patient samples to confirm assay accuracy.
◦ Document all QC results using the provided log and verify
whether they are within the acceptable range.
◦ If QC results fall outside the acceptable range, troubleshoot
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Do not release
patient results until QC issues are resolved and QC is within
the acceptable range.
C. POST-ANALYTICAL PHASE
1. Review Results:
◦ Review the quality control results to ensure they fall within
the acceptable range.
◦ Review the patient sample results for any discrepancies or
flagged values.
◦ Address any errors or concerns with repeat analysis if
necessary.
2. Reporting Results:
◦ Enter verified results into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
◦ Notify the appropriate medical personnel if critical values are
obtained (Critical threshold to be determined by the
laboratory’s defined limits).
◦ Ensure all results and communications are documented and
traceable.
3. Storage of Specimens:
◦ Store analyzed specimens at 2-8°C for 7 days to allow for
possible re-testing.
4. METHOD LIMITATIONS
5. Hemolyzed or lipemic specimens may interfere with the
accuracy of the assay and should be avoided.
6. Ensure to avoid contamination during sample handling and
processing.
7. Refer to the specific assay kit insert for additional limitations.
