Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical
Phase of Generating Results for GENTAMICIN,
TROUGH, PLASMA
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to provide step-by-step instructions for
the analysis of gentamicin trough levels in plasma samples. Accurate
and timely analysis of gentamicin trough levels ensures appropriate
therapeutic monitoring and dosing adjustments.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all personnel involved in the analytical phase of
gentamicin trough plasma level testing in the laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Laboratory Technicians: Responsible for sample preparation,
reagent preparation, instrument calibration, performing the assay,
and initial review of the results.
• Supervisors/Managers: Ensure compliance with this SOP,
validate assays, review results, and authorize reporting of final
results.
• Quality Control Personnel: Ensure all quality control procedures
are followed and address any discrepancies or deviations.
4. REAGENTS AND MATERIALS
• Gentamicin Calibrators
• Control materials (QA/QC samples)
• Protein precipitation reagents (typically, acetonitrile or methanol)
• Reconstitution solvents (e.g., water or buffer)
• Reagent-grade water
• Laboratory consumables: centrifuge tubes, pipette tips, etc.
5. EQUIPMENT
• High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) or LC-MS/MS
System
• Centrifuge
• Automated pipettes and tips
• Vortex mixer
• Analytical balance
6. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Acceptable Specimens: Plasma collected in EDTA or lithium
heparin tubes. The sample should be drawn as a trough level, i.e.,
immediately before the next dose.
• Unacceptable Specimens: Hemolyzed samples, samples
collected in inappropriate anticoagulants (e.g., citrate), and
samples older than acceptable stability limits.
7. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation
1. Plasma Separation: Centrifuge the blood samples at
1500-2000 g for 10 minutes at 4°C and transfer the supernatant
(plasma) to a new labeled tube.
2. Protein Precipitation: Add an equal volume of protein
precipitation reagent (e.g., acetonitrile) to the plasma sample.
Vortex for 30 seconds.
3. Centrifuge: Centrifuge the mixture at 10,000 g for 10 minutes
at 4°C to pellet the precipitated proteins.
4. Supernatant Transfer: Carefully transfer the clear supernatant
to a new labeled tube and proceed with the HPLC or LC-MS/
MS analysis.
B. Instrument Calibration
1. Calibrators Preparation: Prepare a series of gentamicin
calibrators according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Calibration Curve: Inject the calibrators into the HPLC or LC-
MS/MS system and generate a calibration curve. Ensure the
plot of concentration versus response is linear and within the
acceptable range.
C. Quality Control
1. QC Sample Preparation: Prepare quality control samples at
low, medium, and high concentrations.
2. Run QC Samples: Include QC samples in each analytical run
to assess the accuracy and precision of the assay.
D. Sample Analysis
1. Injection: Inject prepared plasma samples, calibrators, and QC
samples into the HPLC or LC-MS/MS system.
2. Detection: Monitor the appropriate ion or retention time and
record the signal.
3. Quantification: Use the calibration curve to quantify
gentamicin levels in the plasma samples.
E. Data Review and Validation
1. Review Results: Examine the chromatograms or spectra for
each sample, ensuring no interferences affect the analysis.
2. QC Results: Confirm that QC results fall within predefined
limits. If QC results are outside the acceptable range,
troubleshoot and repeat the assay.
3. Validation: Verify the gentamicin trough levels using the
calibration curve and internal standard if applicable.
F. Reporting Results
1. Transcription: Enter the validated gentamicin trough levels into
the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
2. Verification: Review and verify results according to the
laboratory’s standard operating procedures.
3. Report: Finalize and release results to the physician or patient
management system.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Possible interference from other concomitantly administered
drugs must be considered.
• Specimens with excessive hemolysis, icterus, or lipemia might
require re-collection or specific troubleshooting steps.

• Manufacturer’s instructions for the specific HPLC or LC-MS/MS
system used.

aminoglycosides (gentamicin).
