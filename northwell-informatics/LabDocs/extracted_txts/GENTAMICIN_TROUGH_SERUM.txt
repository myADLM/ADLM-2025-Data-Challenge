Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Generating Results for
GENTAMICIN, TROUGH, SERUM
1. PURPOSE To outline the procedures for the accurate and
efficient analysis of gentamicin trough levels in serum samples,
from specimen handling to result reporting, in compliance with
quality standards and CLIA regulations.
2. RESPONSIBILITY It is the responsibility of all laboratory
personnel to adhere to this SOP to ensure accurate and timely
reporting of gentamicin trough levels. Laboratory technologists
are responsible for the analysis process, quality control, and
initial reporting, while supervisors are responsible for reviewing
and validating the results.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY Preferred/
Acceptable Specimens:
◦ Serum collected in a red-top tube or serum separator tube
(SST).
◦ The specimen should be collected just prior to the next dose
(trough level).
Handling and Stability:
◦ Transport serum to the laboratory immediately after
collection.
◦ If not analyzed immediately, serum should be stored at
2-8°C and analyzed within 24 hours.
◦ For longer storage, specimens should be frozen at -20°C.
◦ Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
4. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
◦ High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) or
Immunoassay Analyzer.
◦ Gentamicin Calibrators and Controls.
◦ Reagents and supplies as specified by the instrument
manufacturer.
5. PROCEDURE A. Calibration and Quality Control
1. Prepare the analyzer according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
2. Run calibration standards to calibrate the instrument.
3. Run quality control samples at low, medium, and high
concentrations before analyzing patient samples.
4. Ensure quality control results are within the acceptable
range before proceeding with patient sample analysis.
B. Sample Preparation
1. Allow frozen samples to thaw at room temperature and mix
gently by inversion.
2. Centrifuge the SST/red-top tube at 1500-2000 x g for 10
minutes to separate the serum.
3. Transfer clear serum to a clean, appropriately labeled
secondary tube.
C. Analytical Procedure
1. Load the prepared serum samples onto the HPLC/
Immunoassay Analyzer following the instrument’s sample
loading protocol.
2. Input patient information, test codes, and any necessary details
into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
3. Select and start the gentamicin trough test program on the
analyzer.
4. Monitor the analysis process and note any error messages or
alerts.
D. Post-analysis
1. Review the analyzer printouts or digital results for each sample.
2. Check for any flagged results or instrument alerts that may
require reanalysis or further investigation.
3. Conduct reanalysis on flagged samples as needed.
4. Validate results based on quality control performance and
criteria.
5. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
◦ The trough levels of gentamicin should be interpreted within
the context of the therapeutic range, generally 0.5-2.0 µg/
mL.
◦ Results outside the expected range should be verified and
documented.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Enter validated results into the LIS.
2. Ensure that any critical values are communicated
promptly to the appropriate healthcare provider, following
the laboratory’s critical results policy.
3. Document the communication of critical values in the
patient’s laboratory record.
7. QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE A. Ensure daily,
weekly, and monthly quality control checks are performed. B.
Participate in external proficiency testing for gentamicin as
required. C. Document and investigate any out-of-range quality
control results according to the laboratory’s quality assurance
policy.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
◦ Hemolysis, lipemia, and icterus may interfere with the assay.
◦ Ensure all reagents and controls are within expiration and
stored as recommended by the manufacturer.
