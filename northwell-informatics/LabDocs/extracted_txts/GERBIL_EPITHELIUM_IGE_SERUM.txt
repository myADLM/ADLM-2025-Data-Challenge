GERBIL EPITHELIUM, IGE, SERUM SOP Standard Operating
Procedure - Analytical Phase for Gerbil Epithelium, IgE, Serum
1. PURPOSE: The purpose of this SOP is to provide a detailed
and systematic procedure for the analytical phase of generating
results for gerbil epithelium-specific Immunoglobulin E (IgE) in
serum samples.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory staff are responsible for
performing the assay and ensuring the accuracy of the results. It is
also the responsibility of the lab supervisor to oversee the process,
verify the results, and ensure all steps are conducted according to
the protocol.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES:
◦ Elisa microplate reader
◦ Microplate washer
◦ Pipettes and pipette tips (calibrated)
◦ Elisa kit specific for Gerbil Epithelium, IgE, Serum
◦ Calibrators, controls, and samples
◦ Deionized water
◦ Absorbent paper
◦ Timer
◦ Laboratory bench coverings
◦ Waste disposal containers
2. PROCEDURE: A. Sample Preparation:
◦ Ensure serum samples are thawed completely if previously
frozen.
◦ Mix samples thoroughly by gentle inversion, avoiding foam
or bubbles.
◦ Centrifuge samples at 2500-3000 rpm for 10 minutes if there
is presence of particulates.
B. Reagent Preparation: - Allow all reagents to come to room
temperature (18-25°C) before use. - Prepare wash solution, stop
solution and substrate solution as per the kit instructions. -
Reconstitute calibrator and control sera according to manufacturer’s
instructions.
C. Assay Procedure:
1. Plate Layout:
◦ Designate appropriate wells for standards, controls, and
patient samples.
◦ Use duplicate wells for each standard, control, and sample.
2. Addition of Reagents:
◦ Add 100 µL of standards, controls, and samples to the
designated wells.
◦ Cover the plate with a sealing tape and incubate at room
temperature for the time specified in the kit instructions
(usually 30-60 minutes).
◦ Aspirate and wash each well using the microplate washer
with the prepared wash solution, repeating the wash cycle
three times.
◦ Add 100 µL of the enzyme conjugate to each well, cover,
and incubate as specified.
◦ Wash each well as previously described.
3. Substrate Addition:
◦ Add 100 µL of substrate solution to each well.
◦ Incubate at room temperature in the dark for the time
specified (typically 10-30 minutes).
4. Termination:
◦ Add 100 µL of stop solution to each well.
◦ Tap the plate gently to mix.
C. Measurement: - Read the absorbance at the wavelength specified
by the kit (typically 450 nm with a reference at 620 nm) using the
microplate reader.
D. Calculation of Results: - Generate a standard curve by plotting the
absorbance values of the standards versus their corresponding
concentrations. - Determine the IgE concentration of each sample by
interpolating the absorbance values on the standard curve using the
appropriate software.
E. Quality Control: - Include internal controls with each assay run. -
Validate reagent and instrument performance using control ranges
specified by the kit. - Results outside the control range must prompt a
review of procedure and reagents, and re-analysis if necessary.
1. REPORTING RESULTS:
◦ Results are to be reviewed and verified by a licensed
technologist prior to reporting.
◦ Report findings in International Units per Milliliter (IU/mL) as
appropriate for the assay.
2. REFERENCE INTERVALS
◦ Reference intervals should be provided by the
manufacturer’s kit insert or determined based on lab-specific
validation studies.
3. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
◦ Refer to the manufacturer’s kit insert for specific limitations.
◦ Results can be affected by hemolysis, lipemia, or icterus in
serum samples.
◦ Handle serum samples under optimal storage conditions as
IgE levels may degrade over time or in adverse conditions.
4. PROCEDURAL NOTES:
◦ Strictly adhere to the timing intervals indicated in the
protocol for each incubation and reagent addition step.
◦ Always use calibrated equipment to ensure accuracy.
◦ Avoid contamination of reagents and cross-contamination of
patient samples.
◦ Maintain a clean and organized work area to prevent errors.
5. REFERENCES:
◦ Gerbil Epithelium IgE Immunoassay Kit insert.
◦ Relevant laboratory quality control and calibration standard
manuals.
This SOP is effective as of October 2023 and must be reviewed
annually or sooner if there are changes in the methodology or
equipment used.
