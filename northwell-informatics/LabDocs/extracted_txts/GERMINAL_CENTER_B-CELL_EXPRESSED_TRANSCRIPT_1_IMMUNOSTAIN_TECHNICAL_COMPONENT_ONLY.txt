Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Germinal Center B-cell
Expressed Transcript 1 (GCET1) Immunostain, Technical Component
Only
1. PURPOSE To provide a detailed and standardized protocol for
performing the Germinal Center B-cell Expressed Transcript 1
(GCET1) immunostain test for the assessment of germinal
center B-cell markers in lymphoid tissue samples. This
procedure covers only the technical component of the test, from
specimen preparation through to slide staining.
2. SCOPE This SOP applies to all laboratory staff responsible for
conducting the GCET1 immunostain test in the histopathology/
immunohistochemistry (IHC) section of the laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITIES Designated laboratory personnel are
responsible for preparing the reagents, performing the staining
procedure, and ensuring quality control. All staff must adhere to
this SOP to maintain consistency, accuracy, and reliability of
test results.

• Hematoxylin counterstain
• Mounting medium
• Coverslips

• Blocking buffer
• Microscope for slide evaluation
• Timer
1. PROCEDURE
5.1 Specimen Preparation
1. Section FFPE tissue blocks at 4-5 microns using a microtome.
2. Place tissue sections on positively charged glass slides.
3. Bake slides in a hot plate at 60°C for 1 hour or in an oven
overnight.
5.2 Deparaffinization and Rehydration
1. Deparaffinize slides in xylene for 3 x 5 minutes.
2. Rehydrate slides in a graded ethanol series: a. 100% ethanol, 2
x 3 minutes b. 95% ethanol, 2 x 3 minutes c. 70% ethanol, 3
minutes d. 50% ethanol, 3 minutes
3. Rinse slides in distilled water for 5 minutes.
5.3 Antigen Retrieval
1. Preheat antigen retrieval solution in a pressure cooker or
microwave.
2. Place slides in antigen retrieval solution and heat for: a.
Pressure cooker: 2 minutes at full pressure b. Microwave:
10-20 minutes at 95-100°C
3. Allow slides to cool for 20 minutes at room temperature.
4. Rinse slides in PBS for 2 x 5 minutes.
5.4 Staining Procedure
1. Encircle sections with a hydrophobic barrier pen, if necessary.
2. Block endogenous peroxidase activity with 3% hydrogen
peroxide for 10 minutes.
3. Rinse slides in PBS for 2 x 5 minutes.
4. Apply blocking buffer to slides and incubate for 10 minutes to
reduce non-specific staining.
5. Gently tap off excess blocking buffer and apply primary
antibody (GCET1) to each slide.
6. Incubate in a humidity chamber at room temperature for 30-60
minutes.
7. Rinse slides in PBS for 2 x 5 minutes.
8. Apply the secondary antibody (suitable for detection system)
and incubate for 30 minutes.
9. Rinse slides in PBS for 2 x 5 minutes.
10. Apply the detection system (e.g., HRP polymer) and incubate
for the recommended time, usually 20-30 minutes.
11. Rinse slides in PBS for 2 x 5 minutes.
12. Apply the chromogen (e.g., DAB) and incubate until the desired
stain intensity is achieved, generally 1-5 minutes.
13. Rinse slides in distilled water for 5 minutes.
5.5 Counterstaining, Dehydration, and Mounting
1. Counterstain slides with hematoxylin for 1 minute.
2. Rinse in distilled water for 2 minutes.
3. Dip slides in a bluing solution (e.g., ammonium hydroxide) for
30 seconds.
4. Rinse slides in distilled water for 2 minutes.
5. Dehydrate slides through a graded ethanol series (70%, 95%,
100%) followed by xylene.
6. Mount slides with mounting medium and coverslips.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
8. Include positive and negative control slides with each run to
ensure staining specificity and sensitivity.
9. Evaluate controls to ensure appropriate staining and document
any deviations.
10. REPORTING RESULTS The technical component only involves
preparation and staining of tissue slides. The stained slides will
be forwarded to the pathologist for interpretation.
11. REFERENCES This procedure is based on current best
practices and manufacturer recommendations for the primary
antibody and detection system used.
This SOP will be reviewed and updated annually or as needed to
reflect procedural changes or improvements.
