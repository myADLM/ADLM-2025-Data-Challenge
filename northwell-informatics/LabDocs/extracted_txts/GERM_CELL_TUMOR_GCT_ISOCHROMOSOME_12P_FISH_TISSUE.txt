Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Germ Cell Tumor (GCT), Isochromosome
12p, FISH, Tissue
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the analysis and rendering
of results for germ cell tumors (GCT) with a focus on the detection of
isochromosome 12p using Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH)
on tissue samples.
Responsibility: The laboratory staff performing this procedure are
responsible for ensuring that each step in the analytical phase is
carefully followed and documented.
1. EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS
• Fluorescence Microscope equipped with appropriate filters
• FISH Probe specific for isochromosome 12p
• ThermoBrite System (or equivalent hybridization chamber)
• Water bath or Hybridization oven
• Microscope slides
• Coverslips
• Immersion oil
• Xylene, Ethanol (70%, 85%, 100%), Phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS)
• Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue sections
• Denaturation buffer
• Hybridization buffer
• Mounting medium with DAPI
• Positive and negative control FISH slides
1. PROCEDURE
3.1 Pre-Hybridization
1. Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
◦ Bake FFPE tissue sections at 60°C for 1 hour.
◦ Deparaffinize slides in xylene for 2 x 10 minutes.
◦ Wash slides in 100% ethanol for 2 x 5 minutes.
◦ Rehydrate slides through a graded ethanol series (85%,
70%) for 2 minutes each.
◦ Rinse slides in distilled water.
2. Pretreatment:
◦ Immerse slides in pre-warmed (96°C-99°C) Pretreatment
Solution for 10 minutes.
◦ Wash slides in PBS for 2 x 3 minutes.
3. Proteolytic Digestion:
◦ Immerse slides in Protease solution at 37°C for 20 minutes.
◦ Wash slides in PBS for 2 x 3 minutes.
◦ Dehydrate slides in a graded ethanol series (70%, 85%,
100%) for 2 minutes each and air dry.
3.2 Hybridization
1. Denaturation:
◦ Apply denaturation buffer to tissue sections.
◦ Incubate slides on a hot plate (72°C±1°C) for 5 minutes.
◦ Quickly rinse slides in ice-cold 70% ethanol for 1 minute.
2. Probe Preparation:
◦ Prepare FISH probe mixture according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
◦ Denature the probe mixture at 75°C for 5 minutes, then
place on ice.
3. Hybridization:
◦ Apply 10 µL of prepared probe mixture to each slide and
cover with a coverslip.
◦ Seal edges of the coverslip with rubber cement.
◦ Place slides in the ThermoBrite system (or hybridization
chamber) and incubate at 37°C overnight (16-20 hours).
3.3 Post-Hybridization
1. Stringency Washes:
◦ Remove coverslips carefully.
◦ Immerse slides in post-hybridization wash buffer at 72°C for
2 x 5 minutes.
◦ Wash slides in room temperature wash buffer for 1 minute.
2. Counterstaining:
◦ Apply mounting medium with DAPI to each slide.
◦ Cover with a coverslip and seal edges with clear nail polish.
3.4 Detection and Analysis
1. Microscope Analysis:
◦ Examine slides using a fluorescence microscope equipped
with appropriate filters for the FISH probe signals (e.g., Red/
Green).
◦ Capture representative images of the hybridization signals.
◦ Analyze at least 200 nuclei per sample.
2. Interpretation:
◦ Determine the presence of isochromosome 12p by
identifying a duplication of the 12p arm signals.
◦ Compare with positive and negative controls to ensure
assay validity.
3.5 Documentation and Quality Control
1. Documentation:
◦ Record temperature, time, and hybridization conditions in
the laboratory logbook.
◦ Document findings on a standardized report form, including
descriptive notes and representative images.
◦ Review all results by a qualified pathologist.
2. Quality Control:
◦ Perform FISH on positive and negative control slides
alongside patient samples.
◦ Document and monitor any deviations or anomalies in the
analysis.
3. REPORTING RESULTS
• Compile results from image analysis, including details of signal
patterns, verification against control slides, and any technical
notes.
• Verify the data against set laboratory standards for accuracy.
• Communicate findings promptly via the LIS (Laboratory
Information System).
• Forward finalized reports to the requesting physician or
department with detailed interpretations and comments.
