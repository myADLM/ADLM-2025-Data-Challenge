Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Generation of GHRELIN
TOTAL (PLASMA) Results
1. PURPOSE To ensure precise, accurate, and reproducible
results in the measurement of total Ghrelin levels in plasma
specimens.
2. RESPONSIBILITY All licensed medical laboratory scientists are
responsible for conducting this assay and reporting the results.
It is the responsibility of the laboratory supervisor to ensure that
all procedures are followed and the quality control measures
are adhered to.
3. SAMPLE REQUIREMENTS
◦ Specimen Type: Plasma
◦ Collection: Use EDTA anticoagulant tubes for specimen
collection.
◦ Handling: Immediately after collection, centrifuge the sample
at 1600xg for 15 minutes at 4°C to separate the plasma.
Aliquot the plasma into labeled, screw-cap polypropylene
tubes. Samples should be kept on ice during processing.
◦ Storage: Freeze plasma aliquots at -80°C until analysis.
Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
◦ Unacceptable Specimens:
▪ Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
▪ Samples not stored at the appropriate temperature or
improperly processed.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
◦ Equipment:
▪ Centrifuge with refrigeration
▪ Freezer (-80°C)
▪ Calibrated micropipettes and tips
▪ Plate reader capable of reading absorbance at 450 nm
◦ Reagents:
▪ Ghrelin (total) ELISA kit
▪ Deionized water
▪ Calibration and control samples
◦ Supplies:
▪ 96-well microplates
▪ Gloves, lab coat, and protective eyewear
▪ Micropipette tips
▪ Parafilm
5. PROCEDURE A. Pre-Assay Preparation:
◦ All reagents and samples should be brought to room
temperature (20-25°C) before starting the assay.
◦ Prepare and label all necessary dilutions and reagents as
per the ELISA kit instructions.
B. Assay Procedure:
1. Add 100 μL of the standards, controls, and samples into
the appropriate wells. Use a fresh pipette tip for each.
2. Add 100 μL of the enzyme conjugate reagent into each
well.
3. Gently tap the plate to ensure thorough mixing and cover
the plate with parafilm.
4. Incubate the plate at 37°C for 1 hour.
5. Wash the wells with 300 μL of the wash buffer, repeating
the wash step 3-5 times.
6. Add 100 μL of the TMB substrate to each well.
7. Incubate in the dark at room temperature for 15-30
minutes.
8. Add 50 μL of the stop solution to each well. The color
should change from blue to yellow.
9. Read the absorbance at 450 nm using a plate reader.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Run the provided quality control samples (low, medium, and
high) with each assay to ensure the assay is working
correctly.
◦ The assay is considered valid if the control values fall within
the established control limits.
◦ If controls are out of range, repeat the assay and verify
reagents, equipment calibration, and technician technique.
7. DATA ANALYSIS AND REPORTING
◦ Generate the standard curve by plotting the absorbance
values of the standards. Use a linear regression or four-
parameter logistic curve fit.
◦ Calculate the concentration of the samples from the
standard curve.
◦ Verify results to ensure they fall within the acceptable
measuring range of the assay.
◦ Report results in picograms per milliliter (pg/mL).
8. INTERPRETATION AND REFERENCE INTERVALS
◦ Normal reference intervals for total Ghrelin are typically
provided in the kit insert or established by laboratory
validation processes.
◦ Interpret elevated or decreased values in clinical context
with other biochemical and clinical information.
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
◦ The assay may be affected by hemolysis, lipemia, or icteric
samples.
◦ Only use reagents provided in the kit or those separately
validated for use with this assay.
