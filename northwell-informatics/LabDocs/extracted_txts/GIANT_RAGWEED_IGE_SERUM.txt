Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Title: Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for GIANT RAGWEED, IGE, SERUM
Responsibility: All trained laboratory scientists
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for accurate and consistent analysis,
generation, and reporting of GIANT RAGWEED-specific
Immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels in serum samples.
1. DEFINITION
This procedure refers to the analytical methodologies and protocols
used for detecting and quantifying GIANT RAGWEED-specific IgE in
serum samples.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Automation System (e.g., ImmunoCAP system or equivalent)
• Calibrators and controls specific to GIANT RAGWEED IgE assay
• Serum samples
• Pipettes and tips
• Primary reagent trays
• Sample cups
• Clean labware
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred:
• Serum sample collected in red or gold top vacutainers (SST).
• Volume: Minimum 1.0 mL serum.
Unacceptable:
• Hemolysed samples
• Samples contaminated with chemical preservatives other than
those specified
• Unlabeled or mislabeled samples
• Samples with apparent microbial contamination
1. PROCEDURE
5.1 Preparation:
1. Ensure workspace, including benchtop and equipment, is clean
and adequately disinfected.
2. Verify serum samples are correctly labeled and meet
acceptance criteria.
3. Allow refrigerated serum samples to equilibrate to room
temperature.
5.2 Calibration and Quality Control:
1. Refer to the reagent kit insert for calibration protocol.
2. Prepare and run calibrators.
3. Validate instruments per manufacturer's instructions.
4. Run quality control specimens: a minimum of two levels (low
and high concentration) for quality assurance.
5. Document performance of calibrators and controls as per
quality assurance protocol.
5.3 Assay Procedure:
1. Set up the automation system with required trays, reagents,
and sample cups.
2. Load serum samples into the sample processing unit.
3. Run the GIANT RAGWEED-specific IgE assay according to
instrument standard operation procedure.
4. Ensure the instrument completes the procedure without error
codes or malfunctions.
5. Verify instrument-generated results are within expected ranges
before reporting.
5.4 Post-Analytical Review:
1. Ensure all data is accurately captured in the Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
2. Review results for any discrepancies against control limits and
patient history where applicable.
3. Investigate and troubleshoot any outliers or invalid results.
5.5 Result Reporting:
1. Verify results in LIS.
2. Generate patient reports with clear indication of GIANT
RAGWEED-specific IgE levels including interpretation ranges
(e.g., Class 0-6 indicating increasing IgE concentrations).
3. Provide interpretative commentary based on established clinical
guidelines.
4. TROUBLESHOOTING
5. For instrument errors, refer to the instrument manual for
troubleshooting steps.
6. Re-run samples if results are out of expected range and quality
controls repeat without issues.
7. Notify supervisor if errors persist for additional support.
8. Document all troubleshooting steps and outcomes.
9. DOCUMENTATION
10. Maintain log records for calibrations, quality controls, patient
results, and instrument performance.
11. Use specific forms on LIS for documentation. Ensure all records
are signed and dated.

By following this SOP, laboratory scientists will ensure the accurate
and consistent analysis, recording, and reporting of GIANT
RAGWEED-specific IgE levels in serum samples. Regular updates to
this procedure should be made in accordance with the latest scientific
and technological advancements.
