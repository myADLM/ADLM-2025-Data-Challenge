GIARDIA ANTIGEN, FECES TEST (ANALYTICAL PHASE) SOP
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedures involved in the analysis of Giardia antigen
in fecal specimens using an immunoassay method to ensure
accurate, reliable, and timely results for the detection of Giardia
lamblia.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel performing the Giardia
antigen test on fecal specimens in the laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITIES
• All designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the
Giardia antigen test according to this SOP.
• The laboratory supervisor is responsible for the oversight of the
process, ensuring compliance with the SOP, and addressing any
issues that arise during the testing procedure.
• All laboratory personnel are responsible for identifying and
reporting any deviations from the protocol to their supervisor.
4. DEFINITIONS
• Giardia antigen: A specific protein produced by the parasite
Giardia lamblia, detectable in fecal samples.
• Immunoassay: A biochemical test that measures the presence or
concentration of a substance (in this case, Giardia antigen) using
an antibody or antigen as a reagent.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Test kit for Giardia antigen (e.g., ELISA or rapid immunoassay
strips)
• Microplate reader (if using ELISA)
• Pipettes and tips
• Disposable gloves
• Absorbent pads
• Stool collection containers
• Timer
• Distilled water
• Waste disposal containers
6. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND HANDLING
• Specimen type: Freshly collected feces
• Specimen volume: As specified by the test kit manufacturer
• Storage conditions: Store specimens at 2-8°C if not tested
immediately. If testing is delayed for more than 72 hours, freeze
the specimen at -20°C or lower.
• Unacceptable specimens: Specimens not stored or transported
as per guidelines, or specimens contaminated with urine or water.
7. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation
1. Review the test kit manual and expiration dates of all reagents.
2. Ensure all required equipment and materials are on hand and
functioning properly.
3. Wear appropriate PPE, including lab coat, gloves, and safety
glasses.
4. Allow all reagents and specimens to come to room temperature
before starting the assay.
B) Assay Procedure (ELISA as an example)
1. Preparation of Reagents:
◦ Follow the reagent preparation instructions provided by the
manufacturer.
2. Sample Preparation:
◦ Mix the stool specimen thoroughly and use a representative
sample according to the test kit instructions.
3. Loading Samples and Controls:
◦ Pipette the required volume of sample into the designated
wells of the microplate.
◦ include necessary positive and negative controls.
4. Addition of Conjugate:
◦ Add the enzyme-conjugate reagent to each well.
5. Incubation:
◦ Incubate the microplate at the specified temperature and
duration as recommended in the manufacturer’s protocol.
6. Washing:
◦ Wash the wells to remove any unbound material as per the
kit instructions.
7. Substrate Addition:
◦ Add the substrate solution to each well.
8. Second Incubation:
◦ Incubate the microplate in the dark for the specified
duration.
9. Stopping the Reaction:
◦ Add the stop solution into each well to halt the reaction.
10. Reading the Results:
◦ Measure the absorbance at the specified wavelength using
a microplate reader.
◦ Record the optical density (OD) values for each well.
C) Rapid Immunoassay Procedure
1. Preparation of Reagents and Samples:
◦ Prepare all reagents and samples as per the kit instructions.
2. Loading Samples:
◦ Add the fecal specimen to the sample well of the test
cartridge.
3. Addition of Reagent:
◦ Add the supplied reagents according to the kit instructions.
4. Incubation:
◦ Allow the test to develop for the recommended incubation
time.
5. Reading the Results:
◦ Read the test results within the specified time window,
normally 10-20 minutes.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform quality control (QC) testing with each new lot of test kits
and whenever a new shipment of kits is received.
• Run positive and negative controls with each batch of patient
tests.
• Document QC results and investigate any failures in the control
results prior to reporting patient results.
9. INTERPRETATION AND REPORTING OF RESULTS
• Interpret the results based on the manufacturer's guidelines.
• Report positive results indicating the presence of Giardia antigen.
• For any discrepant or equivocal results, repeat the test or consult
with a supervisor.
• Document all results in the laboratory information system (LIS).
10. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's test kit insert and instructions.
• CLSI guidelines for fecal specimen handling and immunoassay
procedures.
• Laboratory Quality Control SOPs.
11. DOCUMENT CONTROL
• Date of Implementation: [Insert Date]
• Approved by: [Supervisor’s Name and Title]
• Revision History: [Record of changes made to the SOP]
This SOP for the analysis of Giardia antigen in fecal specimens is
designed to ensure consistent and accurate results, following safety
and quality control protocols. All personnel must follow this procedure
diligently and report any issues or deviations to their supervisor.
