Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Analytical Phase for
Generating Results for GINGER, IgE
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the procedures for the analytical phase of
generating results for GINGER, IgE. It ensures accuracy,
consistency, and reliability in the determination of IgE levels in patient
specimens.
Responsibilities:
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing the
analytical procedures, documenting results, and ensuring quality
control measures are met.
1. DEFINITION
GINGER IgE refers to the immunoglobulin E levels specific to the
allergen GINGER. IgE is a class of antibodies associated with allergic
reactions.
1. PROCEDURE
A) Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies
• ELISA Reader
• Pipettes and tips
• Microplate washer
• Refrigerated centrifuge
• Microplates with wells coated specific to GINGER allergen
• IgE-specific detection reagents
• Standards and controls
• Calibrators
• Washing buffers
• Substrate solutions
• Stop solutions
B) Specimen Handling
1. Specimen Requirements and Stability
◦ Specimens should be serum or plasma collected in SST or
EDTA tubes.
◦ Whole blood specimens should be centrifuged to obtain
serum or plasma.
◦ Ideal collection and processing time: within 2 hours of
collection.
◦ Specimens should be stored at 2-8°C if not processed
immediately. Long-term storage should be at -20°C or lower.
2. Unacceptable Specimens
◦ Specimens that are hemolyzed, lipemic, or contaminated.
◦ Specimens received in improper collection tubes.
◦ Specimens without proper labeling or documentation.
C) Analytical Procedure
1. Preparation
◦ Read manufacturer’s instructions for the specific IgE assay
kit.
◦ Bring reagents and specimens to room temperature before
use.
◦ Prepare standards, controls, and calibrators according to kit
instructions.
2. Assay Procedure
◦ Add standards, controls, calibrators, and specimens into the
designated wells in the microplate.
◦ Incubate for a specified time based on kit instructions.
◦ Wash wells thoroughly using microplate washer.
◦ Apply detection antibodies to each well.
◦ Incubate the microplate again according to kit instructions.
◦ Wash wells thoroughly.
◦ Add substrate solution to each well, followed by incubation.
◦ Add stop solution to terminate the reaction.
◦ Read the microplate using an ELISA reader immediately
after applying the stop solution.
3. Data Analysis
◦ Use the ELISA reader’s software to analyze absorbance
readings.
◦ Generate calibration curves based on standards.
◦ Calculate IgE concentration in specimens from the
calibration curve.
◦ Review and validate results for accuracy.
D) Quality Control
1. Internal Quality Control
◦ Perform quality controls with every assay run, including
using negative and positive controls specified by the kit.
◦ Document analysis and ensure controls fall within
acceptable ranges.
◦ Address and document any deviations and corrective
actions.
2. Instrument Calibration
◦ Calibrate ELISA reader and microplate washer monthly.
◦ Validate calibration using quality control specimens.
◦ Document calibration results and ensure adherence to
predefined acceptable ranges.
E) Reporting Results
• Results are automatically transmitted to the Laboratory
Information System (LIS) after validation.
• Review and verify results before final reporting.
• Document any discrepancies or unusual findings.
F) Sample Integrity
• Inspections for hemolysis, lipemia, or contamination should be
done before processing.
• In case of questionable sample integrity, consult the supervisor for
necessary actions.
G) Critical Results
• Document and report critical results immediately following the
laboratory’s protocol.
• Ensure proper documentation and follow-up actions.
