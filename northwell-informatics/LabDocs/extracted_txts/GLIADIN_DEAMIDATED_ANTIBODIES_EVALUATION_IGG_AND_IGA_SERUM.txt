Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) GLIADIN (DEAMIDATED)
ANTIBODIES EVALUATION, IGG AND IGA, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the analytical procedures for the
evaluation of Gliadin (Deamidated) Antibodies, IgG and IgA, in serum
specimens. This procedure ensures accurate, reliable, and timely
results that aid in the diagnosis of celiac disease and other gluten-
related disorders.
1. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel who are trained in the
analysis of Gliadin (Deamidated) Antibodies using immunoassay
techniques in a CLIA-certified laboratory.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the laboratory personnel to adhere to this
SOP while performing the analysis of Gliadin (Deamidated)
Antibodies, IgG and IgA. Supervisors must ensure that personnel are
adequately trained and that equipment is maintained and calibrated.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type: Serum Specimen Volume: At least 0.5 mL of serum
Collection: Follow standard venipuncture procedure. Blood should be
collected in a clot activator tube (red top or SST). Specimen Stability:
Specimens are stable for up to 7 days when stored at 2-8°C. For
longer storage, specimens should be aliquoted and frozen at -20°C
or below.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Immunoassay Analyzer (ELISA reader or equivalent) Gliadin
(Deamidated) Antibodies IgG and IgA test kits Calibrators, Controls
(both positive and negative) Micropipettes and Tips Microplate
Washer Incubator capable of maintaining 37°C Disposable gloves,
lab coat, and appropriate PPE Deionized water
1. PROCEDURE
Pre-Analytical Phase
1. Specimen Handling and Processing:
◦ Upon receipt, inspect specimens for proper labeling and
acceptability.
◦ Centrifuge blood specimens at 1500g for 15 minutes to
separate serum.
◦ Transfer serum to a labeled aliquot tube for analysis.
Analytical Phase
1. Preparation of Reagents and Controls:
◦ Allow all reagents, calibrators, and controls to come to room
temperature before use.
◦ Prepare the wash buffer and other reagents as per the
manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Calibration and Quality Control:
◦ Perform calibration using provided calibrators as per the kit
instructions.
◦ Run quality control samples (both positive and negative)
alongside patient specimens to ensure accuracy and
precision.
◦ Record and evaluate QC results. QC results must be within
the established range before running patient samples.
3. Assay Procedure:
◦ Pipette the required volume of patient serum, controls, and
calibrators into appropriate wells.
◦ Add the enzyme conjugate or detection antibody according
to the kit instructions.
◦ Incubate at 37°C for the specified time in the test kit.
◦ Wash the wells thoroughly using the microplate washer.
◦ Add the substrate solution and incubate for the time
specified in the test kit.
◦ Stop the reaction by adding the stop solution.
◦ Read the absorbance of each well at the appropriate
wavelength (usually 450 nm) using the microplate reader.
Post-Analytical Phase
1. Calculations:
◦ Calculate the concentration of Gliadin (Deamidated)
Antibodies, IgG and IgA, in patient specimens by comparing
the absorbance readings to the standard curve generated
during calibration.
2. Validation of Results:
◦ Ensure that all QC results are within acceptable limits.
◦ Verify that all patient results fall within the analytical
measuring range of the assay. If results fall outside the
range, rerun the specimen or take appropriate action as per
laboratory policy.
3. Reporting Results:
◦ Enter the results into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
◦ Review and verify results before releasing them for clinical
interpretation.
◦ Report critical or significantly abnormal values to the
ordering physician as per laboratory protocol.
4. QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE
Maintain quality control records and perform regular instrument
maintenance and calibration. Participate in external proficiency
testing to ensure the analytical accuracy of the assay. Ensure all
personnel receive ongoing training and competency assessments.
