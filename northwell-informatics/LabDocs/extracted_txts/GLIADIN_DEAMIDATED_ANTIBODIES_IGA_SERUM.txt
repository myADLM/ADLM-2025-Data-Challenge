Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Gliadin (Deamidated) Antibodies, IgA,
Serum
1. PURPOSE
This protocol provides detailed instructions for the analytical phase of
generating results for Gliadin (Deamidated) Antibodies, IgA, Serum.
This ensures consistency in testing and the reliability of results.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing the
assay, documenting results, and addressing any deficiencies that
may arise. Supervisors are responsible for ensuring compliance with
this protocol.
1. DEFINITION
Gliadin (Deamidated) Antibodies, IgA testing is used as an
immunological marker for celiac disease. This test identifies
antibodies against deamidated gliadin peptides (DGP).
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen Type:
• Serum
Specimen Collection and Handling:
• Preferred: 5 mL of venous blood collected in a serum separator
tube (SST).
• Allow the blood to clot for 30 minutes at room temperature.
• Centrifuge at 1000-1200 x g for 10-15 minutes to separate serum.
• Transfer serum to a clean, appropriately labeled tube.
Specimen Stability:
• Serum should be stored at 2-8°C and is stable for up to 7 days
after separation.
• For longer storage, serum should be frozen at -20°C or lower and
is stable for up to 30 days. Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed samples
• Specimens with improper labeling
• Specimens that have not been processed within the specified
timeframe
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• ELISA reader or automated analyzer
• Refrigerator capable of maintaining 2-8°C
• Freezer capable of maintaining -20°C
• Centrifuge
Reagents:
• ELISA kit for Gliadin (Deamidated) Antibodies, IgA
Supplies:
• Pipettes and tips
• Gloves
• Serum separator tubes (SST)
• Clean, labeled storage tubes
1. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Bring all reagents and serum samples to room temperature
(20-25°C) before use.
2. Prepare the ELISA plate according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
Assay Procedure:
1. Add appropriate amounts of serum sample and standards to
the wells of the ELISA plate.
2. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for incubation times,
washing steps, and addition of reagents.
3. Read the absorbance using an ELISA reader at the designated
wavelength.
Post-Assay Steps:
1. Record the absorbance values of the samples and standards.
2. Calculate the concentration of Gliadin (Deamidated) Antibodies,
IgA using appropriate software or by manually plotting a
standard curve.
3. QUALITY CONTROL
Internal Quality Control:
• Run positive and negative controls with each batch of samples.
• Ensure the controls fall within the expected ranges.
External Quality Control:
• Participate in proficiency testing programs to validate assay
performance.
Troubleshooting:
• If results fall outside the expected range or QC fails, repeat assay.
• Document any deviation and corrective actions.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
Results Verification:
• Verify the results by comparing them to established reference
intervals and quality control data.
Reference Intervals:
• Negative: < standard cutoff level specified by the kit
• Consider positive above the cutoff specified by the kit.
Documentation:
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Print and store result reports as per laboratory protocol.
Critical Results:
• Any critical results (indicating potential celiac disease) should be
promptly communicated to the appropriate healthcare provider.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the manufacturer's insert for specific reagent pad limitations,
potential interferences, and specific conditions that may affect the
accuracy of the assay.
