Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Generating Results for
GLIADIN (DEAMIDATED) ANTIBODIES, IGG, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
This SOP provides a detailed guideline for the testing and analysis of
Gliadin (Deamidated) Antibodies, IgG in serum to ensure consistency,
accuracy, and reliability of test results. The procedure aims to detect
the presence of these antibodies, which are indicative of celiac
disease.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
All designated laboratory personnel trained in the performance of this
assay are responsible for executing this procedure. The laboratory
supervisor must ensure that the staff adhere to this SOP and address
any deviations or issues accordingly.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Accepted Specimens:
• Serum samples: The preferred specimen is 1 mL of serum
collected in a plain or serum separator tube (SST) after allowing a
blood sample to clot and centrifuging.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Samples with severe hemolysis, lipemia, or icterus.
• Incomplete or improperly labeled specimens.
• Specimens collected in non-serum tubes (e.g., EDTA, citrate).
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment Required:
• ELISA (Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay) Reader
• Incubator
• Microplate washer
• Pipettes and disposable tips
• Centrifuge
Reagents:
• Gliadin (Deamidated) Antibodies, IgG, ELISA kit (Ensure the kit is
within its expiration date and stored as per manufacturer
instructions)
• Calibrators and Controls
• Wash buffer, substrate solution, stop solution, and any other
reagents as per the ELISA kit instructions
Supplies:
• Microplates
• Sample vials
• Biohazard disposal containers
• Gloves and lab coats
5. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
• Allow serum samples, controls, and reagents to reach room
temperature before starting the assay.
• Gently mix serum samples by inversion.
Sample Loading:
1. Label microplate wells according to the specimen, control, and
calibrator layout.
2. Pipette the required amount (as per the kit instructions) of
calibrators into the designated wells.
3. Add the same volume of controls and patient serum samples
into their respective wells.
Incubation: 4. Follow the specific temperature and time conditions
for incubating the plate as mentioned in the kit insert. 5. Cover the
plate with a plate cover during incubation to prevent evaporation.
Washing: 6. Wash the plate meticulously as per the provided
instructions, typically involving multiple cycles of dispensing and
aspirating the wash buffer. Ensure adherence to the wash protocol to
avoid cross-contamination.
Addition of Conjugate: 7. Add the conjugate solution (HRP-
conjugated secondary antibody) to each well. 8. Incubate the plate as
per the kit's instructions, commonly at room temperature for a
specified period.
Detection: 9. Add the substrate solution to each well. Observe for
color development. 10. Stop the reaction using the stop solution after
the specified incubation time.
Reading the Results: 11. Read the absorbance at the specified
wavelength (commonly 450 nm with a reference at 620-630 nm)
using the ELISA plate reader.
6. CALCULATIONS
Data Analysis:
1. Generate a standard curve from the absorbance of the
calibrators.
2. Calculate the concentration of Gliadin (Deamidated) Antibodies,
IgG in the patient serum samples using the standard curve.
3. Ensure all calculations are performed as outlined in the ELISA
kit's instructions.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
Internal Quality Control:
1. Run positive and negative controls with each batch of tests.
2. Verify that control results fall within established ranges before
accepting patient results.
3. Repeat the analysis if control results are not within the
acceptable range.
Instrument Maintenance:
• Ensure regular calibration and maintenance of the ELISA reader,
incubator, and microplate washer according to the manufacturer’s
guidelines.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
Reporting:
• Verify results using laboratory information system (LIS).
• Report concentrations of Gliadin (Deamidated) Antibodies, IgG in
U/mL.
• Critical or significantly abnormal results must be flagged and
promptly communicated to the requesting physician.
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the manufacturer’s insert for specific limitations related to:
• Cross-reactivity
• Interferences (e.g., rheumatoid factor, heterophile antibodies)
• Validation and precision parameters
