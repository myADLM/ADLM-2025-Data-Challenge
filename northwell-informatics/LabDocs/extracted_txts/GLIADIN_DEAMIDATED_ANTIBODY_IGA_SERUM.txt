Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for GLIADIN (DEAMIDATED) ANTIBODY, IGA,
SERUM
1. PURPOSE
To establish a standardized protocol for the analysis and reporting of
Gliadin (Deamidated) Antibody, IgA in serum specimens to ensure
accurate and reliable test results.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory staff and technologists are responsible for
performing the analysis according to this SOP. Laboratory
supervisors are responsible for ensuring that the procedure is
followed and for addressing any issues that arise during the analysis.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
A. Specimen Type:
• Serum
B. Specimen Collection:
• Collect blood in a plain red-top or serum separator tube (SST).
• Allow blood to clot for 30 minutes at room temperature.
• Centrifuge the sample for 10 minutes at 1500-2000 x g to obtain
serum.
• Transfer serum into a clean, labeled transport tube.
C. Specimen Stability:
• Stable at room temperature for up to 48 hours.
• Stable refrigerated (2-8°C) for up to 7 days.
• For prolonged storage, sera should be frozen at -20°C or below.
D. Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples may interfere with test
results.
• Specimens not properly labeled or with insufficient volume.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• ELISA Reader (Spectrophotometer)
• ELISA microplate incubator/shaker
• Micropipettes and tips
• Multichannel pipettes
• Calibration and control materials
• Gliadin (Deamidated) Antibody, IgA ELISA Kit
• Wash buffer
• Substrate and stop solution
• Laboratory timer
• Absorbent wipes
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
1. QUALITY CONTROL
A. Internal Quality Control:
• Run positive, negative, and low-level quality control sera with
each batch of samples.
• Ensure all control results are within the acceptable range before
reporting patient results.
• Document all control results in the QC logs.
B. External Quality Control:
• Participate in external proficiency testing programs as per
laboratory policy.
• Review and document results to ensure the accuracy and
reliability of the testing process.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation:
• Thaw frozen sera at room temperature. Mix by gentle inversion.
• Bring all reagents and samples to room temperature before use.
• Prepare the wash buffer and other reagents as specified in the
ELISA kit instructions.
B. Assay Procedure:
1. Plate Setup:
◦ Assign wells for standards, controls, and patient samples.
◦ Add 100 µL of standards, controls, and diluted patient sera
to assigned wells.
2. Incubation:
◦ Incubate the microplate at the specified temperature (e.g.,
37°C) for the time recommended by the manufacturer (e.g.,
30 minutes to 1 hour).
3. Washing:
◦ Wash the microplate thoroughly with the prepared wash
buffer, following the number of washes recommended by the
manufacturer (e.g., 3-5 times).
4. Secondary Antibody Addition:
◦ Add 100 µL of enzyme-conjugated secondary antibody to
each well.
◦ Incubate the microplate again at the specified temperature
for the recommended time.
5. Final Wash:
◦ Perform additional washes as specified.
6. Substrate Addition:
◦ Add 100 µL of substrate solution to each well.
◦ Incubate the plate in the dark at room temperature for the
specified time to allow color development.
7. Stopping Reaction:
◦ Add 100 µL of stop solution to each well to halt the reaction.
8. Reading the Plate:
◦ Read the absorbance of each well at the specified
wavelength (e.g., 450 nm with a reference filter at 620-650
nm) using the ELISA reader.
9. Calculations:
◦ Calculate the results based on the standard curve and
manufacturer's instructions. Check for any abnormalities or
discrepancies in the data.
10. REPORTING RESULTS
• Review the calculated results for each patient sample.
• Compare results to the reference intervals provided:
◦ Negative: < 20 AU/mL
◦ Borderline: 20-25 AU/mL
◦ Positive: > 25 AU/mL
• Document results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Notify the appropriate healthcare provider of any critical or
unexpected results as per laboratory policy.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Negative: < 20 AU/mL
• Borderline: 20-25 AU/mL
• Positive: > 25 AU/mL
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples may interfere with test
results.
• Heterophile antibodies or immunoglobulin complexes in the
patient’s serum can cause erroneous results.
• Results should be interpreted in conjunction with clinical findings
and other laboratory tests.
