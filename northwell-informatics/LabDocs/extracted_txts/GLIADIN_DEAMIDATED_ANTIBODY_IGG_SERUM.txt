Standard Operating Procedure: Analytical Phase of Generating
Results for Gliadin (Deamidated) Antibody, IgG, Serum
Purpose: To provide a standardized procedure for the accurate
analysis and reporting of Gliadin (Deamidated) Antibody, IgG, in
serum samples. This test aids in the diagnosis of celiac disease and
related conditions by detecting antibodies against deamidated gliadin
peptides.
Responsibility: It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory
staff to perform the analysis following this SOP and ensure the quality
and accuracy of the results.
Specimen Requirements:
• Preferred Specimen: Serum
• Volume: Minimum of 0.5 mL serum
• Collection: Collect blood in a serum separator tube (SST)
• Processing: Allow blood to clot completely at room temperature,
then centrifuge and separate serum from cells within 2 hours of
collection.
• Storage: If the serum is not analyzed immediately, store the
sample at 2-8°C for up to 48 hours. For longer storage, freeze at
-20°C or lower.
Equipment and Reagents:
• ELISA (Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay) kit specific for
Gliadin (Deamidated) Antibody, IgG
• Microplate reader capable of reading at 450 nm wavelength
• Precision pipettes and tips
• Calibrated centrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Incubator (37°C)
• Wash buffer (provided by the ELISA kit)
• Substrate solution and stop solution (provided by the ELISA kit)
Procedure:
1. Preparation:
◦ Bring all reagents and serum samples to room temperature
before use.
◦ Prepare wash buffer according to the kit instructions.
◦ Label the wells of the microplate according to the number of
samples, standards, and controls to be run.
2. Reagent Preparation:
◦ Prepare any necessary reagents as instructed by the ELISA
kit's insert.
◦ Reconstitute the standards and controls provided in the kit.
3. Sample and Control Addition:
◦ Add 100 µL of standards, controls, and patient serum
samples to the appropriate wells in duplicate.
◦ Ensure to include a blank well containing assay buffer only
for baseline corrections.
4. Incubation:
◦ Incubate the microplate at 37°C for the duration specified in
the ELISA kit insert (typically 30-60 minutes).
5. Washing:
◦ After incubation, aspirate the contents of the wells and wash
each well with wash buffer for a total of three cycles. Fully
aspirate after the final wash to remove any residual liquid.
6. Detection Antibody Addition:
◦ Add 100 µL of the enzyme conjugate (detection antibody) to
each well.
◦ Seal the plate and incubate at 37°C for a period specified by
the ELISA kit (typically 30-60 minutes).
7. Washing:
◦ Repeat the washing step as described above.
8. Substrate Addition:
◦ Add 100 µL of the substrate solution to each well.
◦ Incubate the plate at room temperature in the dark for the
duration specified by the ELISA kit (typically 15-20 minutes),
or until the color development is sufficient.
9. Stopping the Reaction:
◦ Add the appropriate volume of stop solution (often 100 µL)
to each well to terminate the reaction.
◦ Gently tap the plate to ensure complete mixing of the stop
solution.
10. Reading the Plate:
◦ Read the optical density (OD) of each well at 450 nm using
a microplate reader.
◦ Record the absorbance values for data analysis.
Quality Control:
• Include both positive and negative controls provided with the kit in
each run.
• Validate the assay by ensuring the control values fall within the
manufacturer's established ranges.
• If controls are out of range, the run is considered invalid, and the
assay must be repeated.
Data Analysis:
• Calculate the average absorbance for each standard, control, and
sample.
• Construct a standard curve by plotting the absorbance values of
the standards against their concentrations.
• Determine the concentration of Gliadin (Deamidated) Antibody,
IgG, in the patient serum samples by comparing their
absorbances to the standard curve.
Reporting Results:
• Record the patient results in the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
• Results should be reviewed and verified by a qualified
technologist.
• Report any critical or unexpected results to the responsible
clinician promptly.
Reference Values:
• Negative: <20 U/mL
• Weak Positive: 20-30 U/mL
• Positive: >30 U/mL
Method Limitations:
• Refer to the ELISA kit insert for limitations related to specificity,
sensitivity, and potential interferences.
References:
• ELISA kit manufacturer's instructions and insert.
• Relevant literature on the diagnosis and monitoring of celiac
disease.
Review and Revisions:
• This SOP should be reviewed annually and revised as necessary
to incorporate any updates in technology, regulatory
requirements, or clinical guidelines.
Approval:
• Laboratory Director: [Name]
• Date: [DD/MM/YYYY]
By adhering to this SOP, the laboratory ensures the accurate,
reliable, and consistent generation of Gliadin (Deamidated) Antibody,
IgG results, essential for the proper diagnosis and management of
celiac disease.
