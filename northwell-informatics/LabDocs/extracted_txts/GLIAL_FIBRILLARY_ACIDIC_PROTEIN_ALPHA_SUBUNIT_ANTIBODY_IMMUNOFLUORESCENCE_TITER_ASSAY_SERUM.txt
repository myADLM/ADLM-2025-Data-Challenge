Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
GLIAL FIBRILLARY ACIDIC PROTEIN ALPHA SUBUNIT
ANTIBODY, IMMUNOFLUORESCENCE TITER ASSAY, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
To provide a detailed step-by-step procedure for performing the Glial
Fibrillary Acidic Protein (GFAP) Alpha Subunit Antibody,
Immunofluorescence Titer Assay on serum samples to ensure
consistency and accuracy of test results.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all qualified laboratory personnel who
perform GFAP Alpha Subunit Antibody, Immunofluorescence Titer
Assay in the clinical laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• It is the responsibility of the laboratory personnel to adhere to this
SOP when performing the GFAP Alpha Subunit Antibody,
Immunofluorescence Titer Assay.
• Supervisors are responsible for training staff and ensuring
compliance with this SOP.
• Laboratory personnel are responsible for following quality control
and reporting guidelines and for reporting any discrepancies or
errors found during the assay.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred Specimen: 5 mL of serum collected in a red-top tube or
serum separator tube (SST).
• Stability: Serum specimens are stable for up to 7 days when kept
refrigerated at 2-8°C. For prolonged storage, specimens should
be frozen at -20°C or lower.
• Unacceptable Specimens: Samples with gross hemolysis,
lipemia, or improperly labeled specimens.
5. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Fluorescence microscope with appropriate filters for detecting
FITC (Fluorescein isothiocyanate).
• Slides pre-coated with human GFAP antigen.
• FITC-conjugated secondary antibody specific to human
antibodies.
• PBS (Phosphate Buffered Saline) at pH 7.4.
• Mounting medium (with anti-fade reagent).
• Positive and negative control sera.
• Micropipettes and tips.
• Humidity chamber.
• Coverslips and slide storage boxes.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run positive and negative control serum with each batch of
patient samples to ensure assay validity.
• Document control results in the Quality Control Log.
• Ensure that the fluorescence microscope is calibrated and verified
for performance before use.
• Any control deviations must be addressed and rectified before
patient sample results can be reported.
7. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Allow serum samples, controls, and reagents to reach room
temperature before use.
2. Prepare PBS and mounting medium according to
manufacturer’s instructions.
Slide Preparation:
1. Pipette 20 µL of serum sample or control onto designated wells
of the antigen-coated slide.
2. Place the slide in a humidity chamber and incubate for 30
minutes at room temperature to allow binding.
Washing Step:
1. After incubation, carefully rinse the slide with PBS to remove
unbound antibodies. Repeat this wash step 3 times for 5
minutes each.
2. Gently tap the slide edge on a paper towel to remove excess
liquid after the final wash.
Secondary Antibody Application:
1. Add 20 µL of FITC-conjugated secondary antibody to each well.
2. Incubate the slide in a humidity chamber for an additional 30
minutes at room temperature.
Final Washing Step:
1. Repeat the PBS wash step (as described in step 5).
2. Allow the slide to air dry in a dark place.
Mounting and Observation:
1. Apply a small drop of mounting medium to each well and cover
with a coverslip.
2. Observe the slide under a fluorescence microscope at 20x to
40x magnification. Adjust the filter to detect the FITC signal.
Reading and Interpretation:
1. Evaluate staining patterns: Positive control wells should show
distinct fluorescence staining of GFAP antigen structures, while
negative controls should show no specific fluorescence.
2. Titer the serum samples starting at a dilution of 1:10 and record
the highest dilution at which specific fluorescence is observed
to determine the endpoint titer.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Document the endpoint titer for each patient sample.
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS) for
verification and reporting.
• Report results according to site-specific guidelines and ensure
that critical values are communicated to the requesting physician
as per protocol.
9. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Negative: No specific fluorescence observed.
• Positive: Specific fluorescence observed; titer reported as the
highest dilution showing specific fluorescence.
10. LIMITATIONS
• Interpret results within the context of clinical findings and other
laboratory results.
• Non-specific binding may occur, interpret with caution.
• Certain treatments and conditions may affect autoantibody levels.
11. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions for antigen-coated slides and FITC-
conjugated secondary antibody.
• Laboratory guidelines for the use and maintenance of
fluorescence microscopes.
12. REVIEW AND APPROVAL
• This SOP is reviewed and approved annually by the laboratory
director and quality assurance team.
