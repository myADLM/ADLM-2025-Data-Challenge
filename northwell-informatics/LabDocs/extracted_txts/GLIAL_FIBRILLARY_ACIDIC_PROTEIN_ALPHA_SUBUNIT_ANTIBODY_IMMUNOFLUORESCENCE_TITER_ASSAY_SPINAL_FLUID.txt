GLIAL FIBRILLARY ACIDIC PROTEIN ALPHA SUBUNIT
ANTIBODY, IMMUNOFLUORESCENCE TITER ASSAY, SPINAL
FLUID
1. PURPOSE To detect and measure the titers of Glial Fibrillary
Acidic Protein (GFAP) alpha subunit antibodies in cerebrospinal
fluid (CSF) using an immunofluorescence assay (IFA). The
presence of GFAP antibodies can be associated with various
neurological disorders.
2. RESPONSIBILITY It is the responsibility of trained laboratory
technologists to perform the immunofluorescence titer assay
and accurately report results according to this standard
operating procedure (SOP).
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
◦ Specimen Type: Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF)
◦ Preferred Volume: At least 1 mL of CSF
◦ Stability: Store CSF at 2-8°C if assay is to be performed
within 48 hours. If storage exceeds 48 hours, freeze the
CSF at -20°C or below.
4. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
◦ Anti-GFAP alpha subunit immunofluorescence assay kit
◦ Microscope slides for IFA
◦ Fluorescent secondary antibodies
◦ PBS (Phosphate Buffered Saline)
◦ Mounting medium with DAPI (4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole)
◦ Cover slips
◦ Fluorescence microscope
◦ Laboratory timer
◦ Incubator set at 37°C
5. EQUIPMENT
◦ Centrifuge
◦ Pipettes and tips
◦ Fluorescence microscope equipped with appropriate filters
◦ Incubator
◦ Slide staining rack
6. PROCEDURE A. Sample Preparation:
1. Centrifuge the CSF specimen at 1500 RPM for 10
minutes to remove any cellular debris.
2. Transfer the supernatant to a clean tube.
B. Immunofluorescence Assay:
1. Prepare the microscope slides by ensuring they are clean
and dry.
2. Add 50 µL of diluted patient CSF sample to the
appropriate wells on the slide.
3. Incubate the slide at 37°C for 30 minutes in a humidified
chamber.
4. Rinse the slide with PBS 2-3 times to remove unbound
antibodies.
5. Add 50 µL of fluorescent secondary antibody to each well.
6. Incubate the slide at 37°C for 30 minutes in the dark.
7. Rinse the slide with PBS 2-3 times.
8. Place a drop of mounting medium with DAPI on each well,
and cover with a cover slip.
C. Microscopy:
1. Examine the prepared slides under a fluorescence
microscope with the appropriate filters.
2. Observe and record the fluorescence pattern and
intensity.
7. TITER DETERMINATION
1. Serially dilute the CSF sample and repeat the
immunofluorescence assay for each dilution.
2. The titer is defined as the highest dilution at which a
specific fluorescence pattern can be observed.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Run positive and negative controls with each batch of
specimens to ensure the accuracy and reliability of assay
results.
◦ Positive control: Known CSF sample with GFAP antibodies.
◦ Negative control: Known CSF sample without GFAP
antibodies.
◦ Document all QC results and take corrective actions if
controls fall outside the established ranges.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ Record the observed fluorescence pattern and intensity.
◦ Report the titer as the highest dilution at which specific
fluorescence is still visible.
◦ Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
for review and verification by a technologist.
10. REFERENCE INTERVAL
◦ Negative: No specific fluorescence observed.
◦ Positive: Presence of specific fluorescence at any dilution,
with the titer indicating the antibody concentration.
11. INTERPRETATION AND LIMITATIONS
◦ Results should be interpreted in the context of the patient’s
clinical presentation and other laboratory findings.
◦ Some factors such as improper sample handling, technical
errors, or interfering substances may cause false-positive or
false-negative results.
◦ Cross-reactivity with other antibodies or non-specific binding
should be considered in the interpretation of results.
