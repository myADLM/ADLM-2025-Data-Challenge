Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) for the Analytical Phase
of Generating Results for Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein (GFAP)
Immunostain, Technical Component Only
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to outline the technical steps
involved in the analytical phase of performing the GFAP
immunohistochemical stain on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded
(FFPE) tissue sections for diagnostic purposes in a clinical laboratory
setting.
Responsibility:
• This procedure is to be performed by qualified laboratory
technologists trained in immunohistochemistry (IHC) and familiar
with the proper use of the staining instruments and reagents.
• It is the responsibility of all staff to ensure proper execution of the
staining procedure and report any discrepancies or issues to a
supervisor.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred: Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue
sections.
• Section thickness: 3-5 micrometers.
• Tissue sections should be mounted on positive charge slides.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• IHC Staining Instrument: Automated IHC staining platform (e.g.,
Ventana BenchMark, Leica Bond, or Dako Autostainer)
• Primary Antibody: GFAP Polyclonal or Monoclonal antibody as
specified by the laboratory
• Detection System: Appropriate secondary antibody and detection
chemistry (HRP-based or AP-based, as per protocols)
• Positive and Negative Control Slides
• Xylene, Ethanol, and Distilled Water
• Antigen retrieval solution (Citrate buffer or EDTA buffer, pH 6.0 or
9.0 depending on the protocol)
• Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) for counterstaining
• Coverslips and mounting medium
• Data recording sheets, labels, and pen/marker
1. PROCEDURE
A. Slide Preparation
1. Deparaffinize sections:
◦ Place slides in xylene for 5 minutes, repeat twice.
◦ Rehydrate sections by sequentially placing in 100%, 95%,
80%, and 70% ethanol for 2 minutes each, followed by
rinsing in distilled water.
2. Antigen Retrieval:
◦ Perform antigen retrieval using a pressure cooker,
microwave, or water bath method as applicable. Use citrate
buffer (pH 6.0) or EDTA buffer (pH 9.0) based on the
antibody datasheet instructions.
◦ Allow the slides to cool to room temperature after antigen
retrieval, then rinse in distilled water and proceed to the
staining platform.
B. Automated Staining Procedure
1. Load slides into the automated IHC stainer:
◦ Assign a protocol for GFAP staining, ensuring appropriate
primary antibody and detection system are selected.
◦ Program and load primary antibody, secondary antibody,
and detection reagents into the instrument.
◦ Initiate the staining run based on the instrument's operating
procedure.
C. Staining Protocol
1. Staining steps typically include:
◦ Block endogenous peroxidase activity using a 3% hydrogen
peroxide solution.
◦ Apply primary GFAP antibody and incubate for specified
time (per manufacturer’s protocol).
◦ Incubate with secondary antibody followed by chromogen
substrate application.
◦ Counterstain with hematoxylin and rinse in tap water.
2. Dehydrate sections through graded alcohols (70%, 95%, and
absolute ethanol), clear in xylene, and coverslip using mounting
medium.
3. Check for proper staining – The presence of strong cytoplasmic
staining in astrocytes within the central nervous system
indicates a successful stain.
D. Quality Control
1. Include positive and negative control slides with each batch of
patient samples.
◦ A known GFAP-positive tissue should be used as a positive
control.
◦ A tissue section processed without the primary antibody
serves as the negative control to check for non-specific
staining.
2. Record the staining run ID, lot numbers, and expiration dates of
the primary antibody and other critical reagents.
3. Review and document the results of the control slides prior to
interpreting patient results. Troubleshoot any unreliable results
as needed.
E. Documentation and Reporting
1. Document all steps in the logbook including:
• Date of staining
• Technician initials
• Tissue ID and block number
• Antigen retrieval method used
• Primary antibody and detection system details
• Control results
1. Transfer stained slides to pathologist for interpretation. Report
any procedural annotations that may assist in the pathologist’s
review.
2. Retain stained tissue sections and control slides as per
laboratory retention policies and regulatory requirements.

detection system.
