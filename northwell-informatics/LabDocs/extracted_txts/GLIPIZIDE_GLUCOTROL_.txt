GLIPIZIDE (GLUCOTROL) ANALYTICAL PHASE SOP
1. PURPOSE
To establish standardized procedures for the analytical phase to
ensure accurate and reliable results for Glipizide (Glucotrol) testing.
Responsibilities
Designated staff are responsible for performing and documenting the
analysis of Glipizide levels according to the procedures outlined in
this protocol. It is the responsibility of the supervisor to ensure that all
procedures are followed correctly and to address any issues that
arise during the analytical phase.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen Type: Blood serum or plasma Collection: Draw 5 mL of
blood into a serum separator tube (SST) or a heparinized tube (light
green or PST). Processing: Allow blood in SST to clot for at least 30
minutes before centrifugation. Centrifuge the SST or heparinized tube
within one hour of collection. Storage: Serum or plasma must be
stored at -20°C or lower if not analyzed immediately. Specimens can
be stable for up to 30 days at -20°C. Avoid repeated freeze-thaw
cycles.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens not processed within the required time frame
• Specimens that are hemolyzed or lipemic
• Specimens collected in EDTA or other anticoagulants
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Liquid Chromatography with Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/
MS) system
• Glipizide reference standard
• Quality control samples (High, Medium, Low)
• Mobile phase solution (Water and methanol, with 0.1% formic
acid)
• Assay-specific columns
• Sample preparation kits and pipettes
• Lab-grade solvents and reagents
1. PROCEDURE
A) Sample Preparation:
1. Thaw frozen samples at room temperature.
2. Pipette 200 µL of serum or plasma into a sample preparation
tube.
3. Add 200 µL of internal standard solution (Glipizide-D5).
4. Vortex samples for 1 minute.
5. Add 400 µL of precipitating reagent to the sample tubes.
6. Vortex samples for 2 minutes.
7. Centrifuge samples at 15,000 x g for 10 minutes.
8. Transfer supernatant to a clean sample vial for LC-MS/MS
analysis.
9. Maintain samples at 4°C until analysis.
B) LC-MS/MS Analysis:
1. Turn on the LC-MS/MS system and perform necessary
calibrations as per manufacturer's instructions.
2. Load samples onto the autosampler.
3. Use the following gradient:
◦ Initial: 10% methanol
◦ 2 minutes: Ramp up to 90% methanol
◦ 4 minutes: Maintain at 90% methanol
◦ 6 minutes: Ramp down to 10% methanol up to 8 minutes
4. Set detection parameters for Glipizide and internal standard
(Glipizide-D5).
5. Inject 10 µL of prepared sample into the LC-MS/MS system.
6. Monitor ion transitions (e.g., m/z 446.1 → 321.1 for Glipizide).
7. Record Chromatograms and quantify using standard curves.
C) Quality Control:
1. Run quality control samples (High, Medium, Low) along with
patient samples.
2. Ensure QC results are within acceptable range:
◦ Intra-assay CV: <10%
◦ Inter-assay CV: <15%
3. Document all QC results along with patient results.
D) Reporting Results:
1. Results are automatically transmitted to the LIS and must be
reviewed and verified by the technologist.
2. Flag and review any results outside clinically relevant ranges.
E) Troubleshooting:
1. Verify system calibration if QC samples fall outside acceptable
range.
2. Repeat analysis for specimens showing abnormal
chromatograms.
3. Consult with the supervisor for persistent issues or atypical
observations.
4. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Therapeutic range for Glipizide in serum/plasma: 100-750 ng/mL.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to LC-MS/MS manufacturer's guidelines for specific limitations
on test sensitivity and specificity.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Internal QC standards should be run with each batch of samples,
verifying the instrument's performance.
• Newly received batches of reagents should be validated by
running performance tests.
