SOP: Analytical Phase Protocol for Generating Results for
Globotriaosylsphingosine (Lyso-Gb3), Blood
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this document is to standardize the
analytical phase procedures for generating accurate and
reliable results for Globotriaosylsphingosine (Lyso-Gb3) in
blood samples. This SOP addresses the steps necessary to
prepare, process, and analyze blood specimens to ensure
quality and accuracy of results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
◦ It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory personnel
to adhere to this protocol when analyzing blood samples for
Lyso-Gb3.
◦ Supervisors must ensure that the standard operating
procedure is followed, documented appropriately, and that
any corrective actions are taken if discrepancies are
identified.
3. DEFINITIONS
◦ Globotriaosylsphingosine (Lyso-Gb3) is a lyso-
glycosphingolipid biomarker used in the diagnosis and
monitoring of Fabry disease.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
◦ Specimen Type: Blood.
◦ Preferred Collection Container: EDTA tube (Lavender
top).
◦ Volume Required: 1 to 5 mL whole blood.
◦ Specimen Stability: Store at 2-8°C if not analyzed
immediately. Stability up to 7 days refrigerated.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
◦ High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) with
Mass Spectrometry (MS) detector or Liquid
Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).
◦ EDTA Blood Collection Tubes.
◦ Reagent kits and calibration standards specific for Lyso-
Gb3.
◦ Pipettes and tips.
◦ Centrifuge.
◦ Storage vials (e.g., microcentrifuge tubes).
◦ Suitable solvents (e.g., methanol, acetonitrile, water).
◦ Internal standards for quantitation.
◦ Quality control samples.
6. PROCEDURE
A. PRE-ANALYSIS
1. Specimen Preparation
▪ Upon receipt, confirm the sample meets acceptance
criteria (proper labeling, collection time, and storage
conditions).
▪ Centrifuge the blood sample at 1500-2000 x g for
10-15 minutes at 4°C to separate plasma.
▪ Aliquot the plasma into labeled storage vials.
2. Preparation of Standards and Quality Control
▪ Prepare calibration standards by diluting stock
solutions of Lyso-Gb3 in appropriate solvent.
▪ Prepare quality control samples at low, medium, and
high concentrations within the calibration range.
▪ Store standards and controls at -20°C when not in
use.
B. ANALYSIS 3. Sample Extraction
◦ To each plasma sample aliquot, add an internal standard.
◦ Add appropriate volume of extraction solvent (e.g.,
methanol), mix thoroughly, and centrifuge to precipitate
proteins.
◦ Transfer the supernatant to a new vial and evaporate to
dryness under nitrogen.
◦ Reconstitute the dried extract with an appropriate solvent
(e.g., mobile phase solvent).
1. Instrument Setup
▪ Set up the HPLC-MS or LC-MS/MS system according
to the manufacturer's specifications.
▪ Ensure columns, solvents, and other accessories are
in place and equilibrated.
▪ Optimize the chromatographic conditions and MS
settings for Lyso-Gb3 detection.
2. Sample Injection and Analysis
▪ Inject standards, quality controls, and extracted
samples into the system.
▪ Run blanks between samples as necessary to prevent
carryover.
▪ Record retention times, peak areas, and other relevant
data for Lyso-Gb3 and internal standards.
C. POST-ANALYSIS 6. Data Processing
◦ Analyze the chromatographic data to quantify Lyso-Gb3
levels in the blood samples using appropriate software.
◦ Calculate the concentration based on the calibration curve,
accounting for the internal standard.
1. Quality Control
▪ Ensure all quality control samples fall within
acceptable ranges as defined in the laboratory’s
quality control plan.
▪ Investigate and address any outliers or discrepancies.
2. Reporting Results
▪ Validate and verify all results prior to reporting.
▪ Report concentrations of Lyso-Gb3 in the appropriate
units (e.g., ng/mL) in the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
▪ Review and approve results as per laboratory
protocols.
7. REFERENCES
◦ Manufacturer’s Manuals for HPLC-MS/LC-MS/MS.
◦ Internal laboratory guidelines and standard operating
procedures.
◦ Relevant literature on Lyso-Gb3 analysis and Fabry disease
markers.
8. DOCUMENTATION
◦ Maintain all records of sample receipt, analysis, quality
control, and result reporting as per laboratory
documentation protocols.
◦ Ensure traceability and integrity of all data pertaining to
Lyso-Gb3 analysis.
This protocol is subject to revisions and updates as necessary to
align with current best practices and technological advancements.
Laboratory personnel should stay informed of any changes and
follow the most current version of the SOP.
