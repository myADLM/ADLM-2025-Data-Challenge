Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for
GLOBOTRIAOSYLSPHINGOSINE (Lyso-Gb3), BLOOD SPOT
Testing
1. PURPOSE
To provide standardized procedures for the analysis of
Globotriaosylsphingosine (Lyso-Gb3) in blood spot specimens. This
test is used to aid in the diagnosis and monitoring of Fabry disease.
1. SCOPE
This SOP applies to the Biochemistry Department and is intended for
use by trained laboratory personnel involved in the analytical phase
of Lyso-Gb3 testing.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
◦ Preferred Specimen: Dried blood spots on filter paper.
◦ Collection: Finger prick or heel stick using a sterile lancet
to collect blood onto designated filter paper cards. Ensure
the spot is thoroughly dry before packaging.
◦ Storage: Room temperature. Blood spots should be stable
for up to 7 days at room temperature. If longer storage is
required, refrigerate or freeze.
◦ Unacceptable Specimens:
▪ Blood spots that are not fully saturated or have serum
rings.
▪ Specimens that are contaminated or improperly labeled.
▪ Samples received more than 7 days old without proper
storage conditions.
2. EQUIPMENT & REAGENTS
◦ Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)
system.
◦ Internal standards and calibration materials.
◦ Extraction solvents (e.g., methanol, acetonitrile).
◦ Mobile phase solvents (HPLC grade water, acetonitrile,
formic acid).
◦ Filter paper cards (Whatman 903 or equivalent).
3. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation:
1. Punch a 3mm disc from the center of each dried blood
spot into a 96-well plate.
2. Add 100 µL of extraction solvent (e.g., 80% methanol +
20% water) containing internal standard to each well.
3. Seal the plate and vortex for 2 minutes to ensure
thorough mixing.
4. Incubate the plate at room temperature for 30 minutes.
5. Centrifuge the plate at 1,500 g for 10 minutes.
B. LC-MS/MS Analysis:
1. Transfer the supernatant from each well to a new 96-well
plate.
2. Load the plate into the LC-MS/MS system.
3. Set up the LC-MS/MS instrument with the following
program parameters:
▪ Mobile Phase A: 0.1% Formic acid in water.
▪ Mobile Phase B: 0.1% Formic acid in acetonitrile.
▪ Column: Reversed Phase C18, 2.1 x 50mm, 1.7 µm.
▪ Flow rate: 0.3 mL/min.
▪ Gradient: Linear gradient from 30% B to 70% B over 8
minutes.
4. Inject 10 µL of the sample into the LC-MS/MS system.
5. Monitor the transition ions specific to Lyso-Gb3 and the
internal standard.
C. Data Analysis:
1. Calibrate the instrument using calibration standards
prepared in relevant matrix.
2. Analyze the sample data against the calibration curve.
3. Ensure quality control samples are within specified range.
4. Calculate the concentration of Lyso-Gb3 in each sample
based on the calibration curve.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Run quality control samples (low, medium, and high
concentration) with every batch of patient samples.
◦ Ensure internal standard peak is present in all samples.
◦ Repeat analysis if QC samples do not fall within the
acceptance range.
◦ Document all quality control activities in the instrument log.
5. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ Results are automatically transmitted to the Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
◦ Review and verify results according to the laboratory’s
verification guidelines.
◦ Report concentrations of Lyso-Gb3 in the unit of ng/mL or
equivalent.
◦ Document any deviations or issues encountered during the
analysis.
6. REFERENCE INTERVAL
◦ Establish and validate reference intervals in accordance
with the clinical laboratory standards (potential intervals:
<1.0 ng/mL is typical for normal individuals).
7. METHOD LIMITATIONS
◦ Interference from hemolysis or other medication should be
assessed.
◦ Detection of very low or very high concentrations may
require dilution or concentration steps.
8. SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS
• Follow all laboratory safety protocols, including wearing personal
protective equipment (PPE).
• Handle solvents and chemicals in a fume hood.
• Dispose of waste responsibly according to laboratory guidelines.
1. DOCUMENTATION
• Maintain all records including sample accessioning, quality
control, results reporting, and equipment maintenance in
compliance with CLIA regulations.

• Laboratory guidelines and instrumentation user manuals.
• Peer-reviewed literature on the analytical methods for Lyso-Gb3
detection.
