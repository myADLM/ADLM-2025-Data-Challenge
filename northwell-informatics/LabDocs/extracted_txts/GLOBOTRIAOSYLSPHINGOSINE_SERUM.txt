Standard Operating Procedure
(SOP) for the Analytical Phase
of Generating Results for
Globotriaosylsphingosine in
Serum
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the necessary steps and
procedures to accurately perform the analysis of
globotriaosylsphingosine (Lyso-GL-3) in serum samples. This
procedure ensures reliable and reproducible results for clinical
diagnosis and patient management.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all staff members performing the analytical
phase of Lyso-GL-3 testing in the laboratory.
3. DEFINITIONS
• Lyso-GL-3: Globotriaosylsphingosine, a biomarker used in the
diagnosis and monitoring of Fabry disease.
• Analyzer: The instrument used for measuring Lyso-GL-3 levels in
serum.
4. RESPONSIBILITIES
• Laboratory Staff: Perform analysis according to this SOP.
• Laboratory Supervisors: Ensure compliance with the SOP and
address any issues that arise during analysis.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND
SUPPLIES
• High-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass
spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) system.
• Serum separator tubes (SST).
• Lyso-GL-3 calibrators and controls.
• Solvents and reagents: Methanol, acetonitrile, formic acid, and
ultrapure water.
• Vortex mixer.
• Centrifuge.
• Pipettes and pipette tips.
• Sample vials and caps.
• Refrigerated storage (2-8°C) for reagents.
6. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND
PREPARATION
Specimen Collection
• Collect blood into SST tubes and allow it to clot at room
temperature for 30 minutes.
• Centrifuge the clotting blood at 1500-2000 x g for 10 minutes to
obtain serum.
Specimen Handling
• Transfer the serum to a clean, labelled sample vial.
• Store serum samples at -20°C until analysis. Avoid repeated
freeze-thaw cycles.
Unacceptable Specimens
• Hemolyzed samples
• Lipemic samples
• Samples with visible particulate matter
7. PROCEDURE
Preparation of Calibrators and Controls
• Prepare Lyso-GL-3 calibrators and controls according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
• Include at least one blank sample (serum without Lyso-GL-3) and
a minimum of five calibrators covering the expected range of
Lyso-GL-3 concentrations.
• Include low, medium, and high controls in each run.
Sample Preparation
1. Thaw serum samples, calibrators, and controls at room
temperature.
2. Vortex each vial for at least 30 seconds to ensure homogeneity.
3. Aliquot a specific volume (e.g., 100 µL) of serum, calibrator, or
control into a clean microcentrifuge tube.
4. Add an equal volume of ice-cold methanol to precipitate
proteins.
5. Vortex the mixture for 30 seconds.
6. Centrifuge the mixture at 14,000 x g for 10 minutes at 4°C.
7. Transfer the supernatant to a clean sample vial for analysis.
Instrumental Analysis
1. Turn on the HPLC-MS/MS system and allow it to equilibrate.
2. Load the prepared samples, calibrators, and controls onto the
autosampler.
3. Set up the HPLC-MS/MS method according to the
manufacturer's guidelines for Lyso-GL-3 analysis.
4. Run the samples in the sequence: Blank, calibrators, controls,
and unknown samples.
5. Monitor and document the system performance, including
column pressure, detector response, and retention time.
Data Analysis
1. Process the chromatograms using the software provided by the
instrument manufacturer.
2. Construct a calibration curve using the peak areas of the Lyso-
GL-3 calibrators.
3. Determine the concentrations of Lyso-GL-3 in the unknown
samples by comparing their peak areas to the calibration curve.
4. Ensure all quality control results fall within the acceptable range
before reporting patient results.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Transmit the results to the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
for review by the technologist.
• Verify results against quality control data before finalizing the
report.
• In case of any discrepancies or unexpected results, repeat the
analysis or alert a supervisor for further investigation.
9. QUALITY CONTROL
• Use calibrators and controls with each batch of samples to ensure
accuracy and precision.
• Perform internal quality control checks as specified (e.g., daily,
weekly, or monthly).
• Document and review all quality control data to identify trends or
issues.
10. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS
• Handle all biological specimens as potentially infectious materials.
• Follow standard laboratory safety guidelines including the use of
personal protective equipment (PPE).
• Dispose of chemical waste according to institutional and
regulatory guidelines.
11. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's instructions for the HPLC-MS/MS system and
Lyso-GL-3 assay kit.
• Current literature on the diagnosis and monitoring of Fabry
disease.
By following this SOP, laboratory personnel can ensure the valid,
precise, and accurate measurement of Lyso-GL-3 in serum samples,
thus supporting the effective diagnosis and management of Fabry
disease.
