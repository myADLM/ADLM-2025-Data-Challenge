Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for GLOMERULAR
BASEMENT MEMBRANE ANTIBODIES, IGG, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
To ensure accurate and reliable results when testing for Glomerular
Basement Membrane (GBM) Antibodies, IgG in serum samples. The
document outlines the specific procedures for preparation, analysis
and reporting of results.
Responsibility:
All designated laboratory staff members are responsible for following
this SOP to ensure the consistency, accuracy, and reliability of the
GBM Antibodies, IgG testing process.
1. DEFINITION
GBM Antibodies, IgG are autoantibodies that target and damage the
glomerular basement membrane in the kidneys. This test helps in
diagnosing autoimmune diseases that involve kidney dysfunction,
such as Goodpasture syndrome.
1. PROCEDURE
a) Specimen Requirements:
Acceptable Specimens:
• Preferred: 0.5-2 mL of serum collected in a red-top tube or serum
separator tube.
• Store and transport the specimen at 2-8°C.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed or lipemic samples.
• Specimens not labeled with collection date and time.
b) Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies:
• ELISA kit for GBM Antibodies, IgG
• Calibrators and controls specific to the kit used
• Micropipettes and tips
• Washer for microtiter plates
• Microtiter plate reader capable of measuring optical density at the
appropriate wavelength as specified by the kit insert
• Incubator set to the appropriate temperature as specified by the
kit insert
• Timer
c) Procedure:
1. Prepare reagents and samples as per the manufacturer’s
instructions included in the ELISA kit.
2. Label wells of the microtiter plate for calibrators, controls, and
patient specimens.
3. Pipette calibrators, controls, and patient specimens into
appropriate wells.
4. Add conjugate and substrate solutions as specified in the
ELISA kit protocol.
5. Incubate the plate at the specified temperature and duration.
6. Wash the wells as per the washing protocol provided in the kit
instructions.
7. Add stop solution and read the optical density at the
recommended wavelength.
Quality Control:
• Run positive and negative controls with each batch of tests.
• QC results must fall within established ranges provided by the
manufacturer.
• If controls are outside the acceptable range, do not report patient
results and troubleshoot according to the manufacturer's
guidelines.
d) Reporting Results:
• Compare patient sample optical densities against the standard
curve to determine GBM Antibody, IgG concentrations.
• Refer to site-specific reporting guidelines for entering the results
into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Interpret results within established reference ranges:
◦ Negative: < Cutoff value (specified by the manufacturer)
◦ Positive: ≥ Cutoff value (specified by the manufacturer)
Critical Results:
• Notify the physician immediately if results indicate a possible life-
threatening condition as outlined in the laboratory's critical values
policy.
• Document the notification according to laboratory protocol.
Method Limitations:
• Refer to the ELISA kit insert for specific limitations related to the
sensitivity, specificity, and interferences related to GBM Antibody,
IgG testing.

reporting results.
1. ADDITIONAL NOTES
• Ensure specimens are properly labeled and stored before testing.
• Maintain proper documentation for each step of the testing
process, including calibration curves, control results, and testing
logs.
• Observe all safety protocols when handling biological specimens
and testing reagents.
By following this SOP, laboratory staff will ensure consistent,
accurate, and reliable results for GBM Antibodies, IgG, aiding in the
appropriate diagnosis and management of related conditions.
