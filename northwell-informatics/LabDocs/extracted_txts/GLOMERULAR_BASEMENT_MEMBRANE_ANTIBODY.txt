Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase for Generating Results of Glomerular
Basement Membrane (GBM) Antibody
1. PURPOSE
To provide standardized procedures for measuring Glomerular
Basement Membrane (GBM) Antibody levels in patient samples and
accurately generating results.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the assay
and documenting results according to the procedures defined in this
protocol.
2. PRINCIPLE AND/OR PURPOSE
The GBM Antibody test is used for the serological detection of
antibodies against the glomerular basement membrane, typically
associated with autoimmune kidney disorders such as Goodpasture’s
syndrome. Accurate measurement is crucial to diagnostic and
therapeutic decision-making.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS:
* Preferred Specimen:
- Serum collected in a red-top tube (without anticoagulant) or a serum separator tube (SST).
* Acceptable Specimen:
- Plasma collected in ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) or heparin tubes.
* Unacceptable Specimens:
- Specimens with gross hemolysis or lipemia.
- Specimens with incorrect collection time or date not documented.
- Specimens stored beyond acceptable stability limits (i.e., more than 7 days at 2-8°C or more than 1 month at -20°C).
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES:
* ELISA (Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay) Reader
* ELISA Plates Specific for GBM Antibody
* GBM Antibody Standard Controls
* Pipettes and Tips
* Plate Washer
* Incubators set at 37°C
* Microplate cover
* Timer
* Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) as required
5. PROCEDURE:
1. PREPARATION:
- Ensure all reagents and controls are at room temperature before use.
- Prepare samples and controls as described by the manufacturer's instructions.
2. ASSAY SETUP:
- Add 100 µL of sample, positive controls, and negative controls to the appropriate wells in the ELISA plate.
- Cover the plate and incubate at 37°C for the specified time (typically 60 minutes).
3. WASHING:
- Use the plate washer to wash each well 3-5 times with the wash buffer to remove unbound substances.
4. SECOND INCUBATION:
- Add 100 µL of conjugate solution (e.g., enzyme-labeled secondary antibody) to each well.
- Cover the plate and incubate at 37°C for an additional 60 minutes.
5. FINAL WASHING:
- Wash each well again 3-5 times with the wash buffer.
6. SUBSTRATE INCUBATION:
- Add 100 µL of substrate solution to each well. Incubate the plate in the dark for the time specified by the manufacturer.
7. STOPPING THE REACTION:
- Add 100 µL of stop solution to each well to halt the enzymatic reaction.
8. READING RESULTS:
- Read the absorbance of each well using an ELISA plate reader at the wavelength specified (typically 450 nm).
- Document the absorbance values and compare them to the standard curve.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
* Run positive and negative controls with each batch of samples to ensure assay accuracy.
* Record all control results on QC logs and compare to previous runs for consistency.
* Investigate any deviations from expected values and take corrective action if controls are out of range.
7. REPORTING RESULTS:
* Use the standard curve to calculate GBM antibody concentration in each sample.
* Document the results in the laboratory information system (LIS).
* Verify and approve results before they are released to patient records.
* Notify the appropriate healthcare provider if critical values are observed.
8. REFERENCE INTERVALS:
* Negative: < X U/mL (value to be specified per laboratory standards)
* Equivocal: X - Y U/mL (value to be specified per laboratory standards)
* Positive: > Y U/mL (value to be specified per laboratory standards)
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
* Refer to the manufacturer's assay kit instructions for specific limitations regarding reagent and procedure sensitivity/specificity.
