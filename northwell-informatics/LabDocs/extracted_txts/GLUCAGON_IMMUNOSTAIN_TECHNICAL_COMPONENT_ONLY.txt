Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Generating Results for
Glucagon Immunostain, Technical Component Only
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this SOP is to outline the
procedures for performing and verifying the technical aspects of
the Glucagon Immunostain to ensure accurate and reliable
results.
2. SCOPE This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel
performing the technical component of the Glucagon
Immunostain procedure.
3. RESPONSIBILITY It is the responsibility of all laboratory
personnel to perform the procedure as outlined and to
document all steps accurately. Supervisors are responsible for
ensuring compliance with this SOP and for addressing any
issues that arise during the procedure.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred specimen: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue
sections.
• Unacceptable specimens: Specimens that are improperly fixed or
processed, or that do not meet the quality requirements for
immunohistochemical staining.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Microtome
• Slides and slide labels
• Xylene and ethanol (graded series)
• Heat-induced epitope retrieval system (e.g., microwave, pressure
cooker)
• Tris Buffered Saline with Tween-20 (TBST) wash buffer
• Peroxidase blocking solution
• Protein blocking solution
• Primary antibody: Anti-glucagon antibody
• Secondary antibody: HRP-conjugated secondary antibody
• DAB chromogen
• Hematoxylin counterstain
• Coverslips and mounting medium
• Control slides: Known positive and negative tissue controls
1. PROCEDURE 6.1. Pre-Staining Preparation
• Ensure all reagents and equipment are prepared and in good
working condition.
• Cut 4-5 μm thick sections from the formalin-fixed, paraffin-
embedded tissue blocks using a microtome.
• Place sections on positively charged microscope slides and allow
them to air dry.
6.2. Deparaffinization and Rehydration
• Deparaffinize the tissue sections by immersing the slides in
xylene (2 changes, 5 minutes each).
• Rehydrate the slides by passing them through graded alcohols
(100%, 95%, 70%, and 50% ethanol, 5 minutes each) followed by
a rinse in distilled water.
6.3. Antigen Retrieval
• Perform heat-induced epitope retrieval using an appropriate buffer
(e.g., citrate buffer, pH 6.0) in a microwave, pressure cooker, or
dedicated antigen retrieval system.
• Allow slides to cool to room temperature and rinse in TBST wash
buffer.
6.4. Blocking Steps
• Block endogenous peroxidase activity by incubating the slides
with peroxidase blocking solution for 10 minutes.
• Rinse slides in TBST wash buffer.
• Apply protein blocking solution to reduce non-specific binding and
incubate for 10 minutes. Blot off excess blocking solution.
6.5. Primary Antibody Incubation
• Apply the anti-glucagon primary antibody to each tissue section
and incubate according to manufacturer’s instructions (typically 60
minutes at room temperature or overnight at 4°C).
• Rinse slides in TBST wash buffer.
6.6. Secondary Antibody Incubation
• Apply the HRP-conjugated secondary antibody and incubate for
30 minutes at room temperature.
• Rinse slides in TBST wash buffer.
6.7. Chromogen Development
• Develop the color reaction by applying the DAB chromogen for
the time specified by the manufacturer (usually 5-10 minutes).
• Rinse slides in distilled water.
6.8. Counterstaining and Mounting
• Counterstain the slides with hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes to
visualize the tissue morphology.
• Rinse in tap water and differentiate in an acid alcohol solution (1%
HCl in 70% ethanol) if necessary.
• Rinse in distilled water and dehydrate by passing through graded
alcohols (70%, 95%, 100%) and xylene.
• Mount the slides with coverslips using a permanent mounting
medium.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run known positive and negative control slides with each batch of
patient samples to ensure staining quality and specificity.
• Document the results of control slides in a Quality Control
logbook.
• Repeat staining if controls do not perform as expected.
1. DOCUMENTATION AND REPORTING
• Record the staining procedure in the laboratory logbook, including
the date, batch number, and initials of the technologist.
• Generate technical-only results, including staining quality,
specimen acceptability, and any observed issues.
• Forward the slides to the pathologist for interpretation.
1. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS
• Follow all laboratory safety protocols, including the use of
personal protective equipment (PPE) such as lab coats, gloves,
and safety goggles.
• Handle all reagents, particularly DAB and other hazardous
chemicals, according to Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS)
guidelines.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's instructions for all reagents and antibodies used.
• Relevant laboratory safety and quality control protocols.
• Applicable clinical laboratory standards and guidelines.
By following this SOP, laboratory personnel can ensure consistent
and accurate preparation and staining of tissue sections for Glucagon
Immunostain, supporting reliable diagnostic results.
