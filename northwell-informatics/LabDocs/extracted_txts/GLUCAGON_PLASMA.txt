STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE PROCEDURE TITLE:
ANALYSIS OF GLUCAGON IN PLASMA
1. PURPOSE This SOP outlines the procedures for the analysis of
glucagon levels in plasma. Accurate measurement and timely
reporting of glucagon levels are crucial for managing patient
care, particularly in cases of endocrine disorders such as
diabetes and pancreatic diseases.
Responsibility: All laboratory staff are responsible for adhering to
these procedures for consistent and accurate results. Supervisors
are responsible for ensuring proper training and compliance with the
procedures.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND ACCEPTABILITY
Preferred/Acceptable:
• Specimen Type: Plasma obtained from a blood sample.
• Collection Tubes: EDTA tubes.
• Volume: Minimum of 2 mL of plasma required.
Unacceptable:
• Specimens collected in tubes other than EDTA tubes.
• Hemolyzed or clotted samples.
• Specimens that have been stored at inappropriate temperatures
or for longer than the specified stability period.
Specimen Stability:
• Room Temperature: Not acceptable.
• Refrigerated (2-8°C): Stable for up to 24 hours.
• Frozen (-20°C or lower): Stable for up to 3 months.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Glucagon ELISA kit (manufacturer specific; refer to product insert
for detailed specifications)
• Microplate reader capable of measuring absorbance at specified
wavelengths
• Pipettes and tips for precise measurement
• Plate shaker
• Calibrated centrifuge
• Laboratory timer
• PPE (Personal Protective Equipment): Lab coat, gloves, eye
protection
1. PROCEDURE A. Preparation:
2. Ensure all reagents and equipment are ready and that the
ELISA kit components are brought to room temperature.
3. Label the microplate wells as required.
B. Sample Preparation:
1. Centrifuge blood samples collected in EDTA tubes at
1000-2000 x g for 10 minutes at 4°C.
2. Carefully transfer plasma into labeled microtubes without
disturbing the cell layer.
3. Store plasma samples at -20°C or lower if not analyzed
immediately.
C. Assay Procedure (ELISA):
1. Add the appropriate amount of washing buffer to the wells in the
microplate as per the kit instructions.
2. Pipette the standards, controls, and samples into designated
wells.
3. Add the detection reagent to each well, ensuring thorough
mixing.
4. Incubate the plate in a plate shaker at room temperature for the
specified time as indicated by the kit instructions.
5. Wash the plate multiple times using the washing buffer to
remove unbound substances.
6. Add the substrate solution to each well and incubate in the dark
for the specified time.
7. Add the stop solution to terminate the reaction.
8. Measure the absorbance in each well using the microplate
reader at the specified wavelength.
D. Data Analysis:
1. Generate a standard curve using the absorbance readings of
the standards.
2. Calculate the glucagon concentration of the samples by
interpolating from the standard curve.
3. Ensure all calculations are verified for accuracy.
4. QUALITY CONTROL A. Internal Controls:
• Ensure quality control samples (both high and low) are included in
each run.
• Document all control results and ensure they fall within
acceptable ranges before analyzing patient samples.
B. External Calibration:
• Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for calibrating equipment
such as microplate readers.
• Ensure that all reagents and kits are within their expiration dates
and properly stored.
1. REPORTING RESULTS A. Result Documentation:
• Record results in the laboratory information system (LIS)
promptly.
• Review data for consistency and accuracy before reporting.
B. Critical Values:
• Report any critical results to the attending physician immediately
and record the notification.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Refer to the manufacturer's kit insert for specific reference ranges
for glucagon levels in plasma.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Review the kit insert for any known limitations of the assay
including interferences and restrictions on specimen types.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's kit insert for Glucagon ELISA.
• Laboratory guidelines and policies on analytical procedures.
This protocol must be strictly followed by all trained personnel.
Supervisors must ensure continuous compliance and address any
issues immediately to maintain high standards of laboratory practice.
