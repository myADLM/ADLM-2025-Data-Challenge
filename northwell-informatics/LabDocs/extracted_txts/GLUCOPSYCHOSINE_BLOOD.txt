Standard Operating Procedures (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase Protocol for Generating Results for
GLUCOPSYCHOSINE, BLOOD
1. PURPOSE To establish standard procedures for the analysis
and reporting of Glucopsychosine in blood samples. This SOP
ensures accuracy, reliability, and consistency in test results.
Responsibility:
• Laboratory personnel are responsible for following this SOP when
performing Glucopsychosine blood testing.
• Supervisors are responsible for training staff, overseeing
adherence to the SOP, and addressing any issues that may arise
during testing.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
◦ Acceptable Specimens: • 5 mL of whole blood collected in
EDTA tubes (Lavender top). • Specimens must be
transported and stored at 2-8°C and analyzed within 48
hours of collection.
◦ Unacceptable Specimens: • Specimens collected in non-
EDTA tubes. • Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples. •
Specimens not stored at the appropriate temperature or
exceeding the stability limit.
2. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
◦ High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) System
◦ Analytical balance
◦ Centrifuge
◦ Pipettes and tips
◦ HPLC-grade solvents (e.g., methanol, water)
◦ Glucopsychosine standards and controls
◦ EDTA tubes (Lavender top)
◦ Sample preparation vials
3. PROCEDURE A. Sample Preparation: 1. Homogenize the
blood sample by gently inverting the EDTA tube several times.
2. Centrifuge the sample at 1500 x g for 10 minutes at 4°C to
separate plasma. 3. Transfer the plasma to a clean sample
preparation vial using a pipette, avoiding the buffy coat and
cells. 4. Prepare calibration standards and quality control
samples according to manufacturer instructions.
B. HPLC Analysis: 1. Turn on the HPLC system and allow it to
stabilize according to the manufacturer’s instructions. 2. Set the
HPLC parameters: • Column: C18 reverse phase • Mobile
phase: Methanol:Water (70:30) • Flow rate: 1.0 mL/min •
Detection: UV at 210 nm 3. Inject calibration standards, quality
control samples, and patient samples into the HPLC system. 4.
Record retention times and peak areas for Glucopsychosine.
C. Quality Control: 1. Run internal and external quality control
samples at the beginning of each batch. 2. Verify that QC
results fall within the established acceptable range. If QC
results are outside the range, investigate, resolve any issues,
and re-run samples as needed. 3. Document all QC results in
the appropriate log.
4. DATA ANALYSIS
◦ Calculate the concentration of Glucopsychosine in patient
samples using the calibration curve generated from the
standards.
◦ Convert peak area to concentration (µg/mL) using the linear
regression equation obtained from the calibration curve.
5. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ Review all test results for accuracy and completeness.
◦ Report results in µg/mL.
◦ Immediate reporting of critical and abnormal values to the
clinician according to the laboratory’s critical value
notification policy.
6. SAMPLE INTEGRITY
◦ Any issues with sample integrity (e.g., hemolysis, improper
storage) should be noted, and the sample should be flagged
for re-collection if necessary.
◦ If sample integrity is compromised, document the issue and
consult with the supervisor before proceeding.
7. REFERENCES
◦ Relevant equipment manuals and user guides.
◦ Manufacturer’s instructions for reagents, calibrators, and
control materials.
8. DOCUMENTATION
◦ Record all steps taken in specimen preparation, HPLC
analysis, quality control, data analysis, and results reporting.
◦ Maintain all records according to laboratory policies and
procedures.
9. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If technical issues arise during analysis (e.g., instrument
malfunction, unexpected results), refer to the HPLC system
troubleshooting guide.
• For unresolved issues, notify the supervisor and document the
problem and corrective actions taken.
By adhering to this protocol, laboratory personnel will ensure the
accurate and consistent analysis and reporting of Glucopsychosine in
blood samples, maintaining the reliability of laboratory results.
