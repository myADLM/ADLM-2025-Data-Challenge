1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this protocol is to outline the steps for the analytical
phase of generating results for Glucopsychosine analysis in blood
spot samples. This procedure ensures accurate, precise, and
reproducible results while maintaining the integrity and traceability of
the samples.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory personnel to follow
this protocol for the analysis of blood spot samples for
Glucopsychosine. Additionally, laboratory supervisors are responsible
for ensuring compliance with this protocol and addressing any
deviations or issues that arise during the analytical process.
1. DEFINITION
Glucopsychosine is a specific biomarker used in the diagnosis and
monitoring of certain lysosomal storage disorders. Blood spot
samples refer to dried blood spots collected typically on filter paper.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation
1. Ensure that blood spot samples have been received,
accessioned, and logged appropriately.
2. Record the sample identity, collection date, and time, and verify
against accompanying documentation.
3. Allow blood spot samples to come to room temperature if they
were stored refrigerated or frozen.
B. Extraction of Glucopsychosine from Blood Spots
1. Cut out a 3 mm diameter disc from the center of the blood spot
using a sterile hole puncher.
2. Place the disc in a clean microcentrifuge tube.
3. Add 500 µL of extraction solvent (methanol-water mixture,
80:20 v/v) to the tube.
4. Vortex the tube for 1 minute to ensure thorough mixing.
5. Incubate the tube at room temperature for 30 minutes with
intermittent vortexing every 10 minutes.
6. Centrifuge the tube at 10,000 x g for 5 minutes to pellet any
particulate matter.
7. Transfer the supernatant to a new microcentrifuge tube,
avoiding the pellet.
C. Analysis by Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/
MS)
1. Set up the LC-MS/MS instrument according to manufacturer
instructions, ensuring all parameters specific to
Glucopsychosine analysis are properly configured.
2. Prepare calibration standards and quality control samples using
known concentrations of Glucopsychosine.
3. Inject 10 µL of the extracted blood spot sample supernatant into
the LC-MS/MS system.
4. Run the analysis according to the following conditions:
◦ Column: C18, 100 x 2.1 mm, 1.7 µm particles
◦ Mobile Phase A: Water with 0.1% formic acid
◦ Mobile Phase B: Acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid
◦ Flow Rate: 0.3 mL/min
◦ Gradient: start at 5% B, ramp to 95% B over 10 minutes,
hold for 2 minutes, return to initial conditions over 3 minutes
◦ Detection: Positive ion mode, multiple reaction monitoring
(MRM) for Glucopsychosine
5. Review the chromatograms and mass spectra for each sample
to identify and quantify Glucopsychosine.
D. Data Analysis and Result Generation
1. Use the LC-MS/MS software to quantify Glucopsychosine
concentration in each sample based on the calibration curve
generated with the standards.
2. Perform quality control checks by comparing the results of QC
samples against their known values.
3. Investigate any out-of-range QC results, and take corrective
action as necessary.
4. Enter the quantified Glucopsychosine results into the
Laboratory Information System (LIS) for each patient sample.
E. Reporting Results
1. Review and verify all results for accuracy and consistency.
2. Ensure that any critical values are reported immediately to the
appropriate healthcare provider following established
procedures.
3. Generate a final report with Glucopsychosine concentration
results, including reference ranges and any interpretive
comments, and release the results in the LIS.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
5. Use two levels of commercially available Glucopsychosine
controls with each batch of patient samples analyzed.
6. Store quality control materials as recommended by the
manufacturer, and document lot numbers and expiration dates.
7. Review and document quality control results, ensuring they fall
within acceptable limits before releasing patient results.
8. Address any discrepancies or deviations in quality control
results promptly, and take corrective actions as needed.
9. DOCUMENTATION
10. Document all steps of the analytical procedure, including
sample preparation, extraction, analysis, and result generation.
11. Maintain logs of instrument calibration, maintenance, and any
troubleshooting performed.
12. Ensure all records are traceable and stored according to
laboratory policies and regulatory requirements.
13. REFERENCES
14. Manufacturer's instructions for the LC-MS/MS instrument and
reagents used in the analysis.

including dates and descriptions of revisions, and maintain a record
of all previous versions.
