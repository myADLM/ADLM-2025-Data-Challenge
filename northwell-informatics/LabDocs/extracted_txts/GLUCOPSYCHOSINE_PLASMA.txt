1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to outline the process for the
analytical phase of generating accurate and reliable results for
Glucopsychosine in plasma samples in the laboratory. This includes
the steps from sample preparation, analysis, to result reporting.
1. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel handling plasma
samples for the purpose of Glucopsychosine analysis within the
laboratory.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
The laboratory personnel performing the analysis are responsible for
following this protocol accurately and maintaining the integrity of the
samples and data. The laboratory supervisor is responsible for
ensuring the compliance with the protocol and addressing any issues
that arise during the analytical process.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND HANDLING
Specimen Type: Plasma Specimen Collection:
• Preferred Collection Tube: EDTA (Lavender-top) tube
• Minimum Volume: 2 mL of plasma Specimen Handling:
• After collection, centrifuge the sample at 1500 x g for 10 minutes
at 4°C.
• Aliquot the plasma into appropriately labeled tubes.
• Store plasma samples at -20°C or lower until analysis.
Specimen Stability:
• Plasma samples are stable for up to 1 month at -20°C.
• Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed specimens
• Specimens with insufficient volume
• Specimens not stored under appropriate conditions (e.g., samples
thawed for extended periods)
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
Equipment:
• High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) System with
Fluorescence Detector
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes and Pipette Tips
• Vortex Mixer
• Freezer (-20°C or lower)
Reagents:
• Glucopsychosine Standard Solution
• Internal Standard Solution
• Mobile Phase: Acetonitrile, Water, and Formic Acid
• Calibration and Quality Control Materials
1. PROCEDURE
Sample Preparation:
1. Thaw plasma samples on ice and ensure complete thawing.
2. Vortex plasma samples to ensure thorough mixing.
3. Pipette 500 µL of plasma into a labeled microcentrifuge tube.
4. Add 50 µL of Internal Standard Solution to each sample.
5. Vortex the mixture for 15 seconds.
6. Centrifuge the samples at 1500 x g for 10 minutes at 4°C.
7. Transfer the supernatant to HPLC vials for analysis.
HPLC Analysis:
1. Set up the HPLC system according to manufacturer
instructions.
2. Prepare the mobile phase: Acetonitrile:Water:Formic Acid
(70:30:0.1, v/v/v).
3. Equilibrate the HPLC column with the mobile phase.
4. Inject 10 µL of the prepared sample into the HPLC system.
5. Run the HPLC method: [Enter specific chromatographic
conditions, e.g., flow rate, column temperature]
6. Record the fluorescence signal associated with
Glucopsychosine.
Calibration and Quality Control:
1. Prepare calibration standards of Glucopsychosine in plasma at
concentrations of [Enter Concentration Range].
2. Prepare quality control samples at low, medium, and high
concentration levels.
3. Process and analyze calibration standards and quality control
samples using the same procedure as patient samples.
4. Verify that all QC samples fall within acceptable limits.
5. REPORTING RESULTS
Data Analysis:
1. Quantitate Glucopsychosine in plasma samples by comparing
the sample peak area to the calibration curve.
2. Utilize internal standard normalization to correct for any
variations in sample preparation or analysis.
Result Documentation:
1. Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
2. Ensure all results are reviewed and verified by a qualified
technologist.
3. Document any deviations from the protocol and corrective
actions taken in the case of outliers or invalid results.
Critical Results:
• Notify the attending physician of any critical Glucopsychosine
values immediately.
• Document the notification in the patient’s record.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
Internal Quality Control:
• Analyze three levels of control (Low, Medium, High) with each
batch of patient samples.
• Investigate and take corrective actions for any QC results that fall
outside the established acceptable range.
Instrument Calibration:
• Perform calibration of the HPLC system using calibration
standards as outlined above.
• Verify calibration at regular intervals and after any maintenance
activities.
Method Validation:
• Perform method validation according to established guidelines.
• Document all validation results and protocols.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Reference intervals for Glucopsychosine in plasma: [Provide
reference interval based on laboratory's validation and clinical
guidelines]
1. REFERENCES
• [List any references such as published literature, instrument
manuals, package inserts]
