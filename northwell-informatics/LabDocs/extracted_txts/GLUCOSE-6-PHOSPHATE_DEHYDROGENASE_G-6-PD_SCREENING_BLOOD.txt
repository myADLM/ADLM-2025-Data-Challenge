Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase
(G-6-PD) Screening, Blood
1. PURPOSE To provide a standardized protocol for the screening
and analysis of Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase (G-6-PD) in
blood samples.
2. RESPONSIBILITY It is the responsibility of trained laboratory
personnel to perform G-6-PD screening tests, document results, and
ensure the accuracy and reliability of the data. Supervisors are
responsible for overseeing the procedure and troubleshooting any
issues that may arise.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred Specimen: Whole blood collected in an EDTA tube.
• Specimen Stability: Blood samples must be stored at 2-8°C and
tested within 5 days of collection.
• Unacceptable Specimens: Blood samples collected in any
anticoagulant other than EDTA, specimens received after 5 days
of collection, clotted specimens, or specimens with insufficient
volume.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Automated hematology analyzer
• Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase assay kits/reagents
• Pipettes and tips
• Centrifuge (if necessary)
• Timer
• Test tubes
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
5. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation
1. Verify the receipt of the specimen according to the laboratory's
accessioning protocol.
2. Store the specimen at 2-8°C until ready for analysis.
B. G-6-PD Screening Assay Setup
1. Bring reagents and samples to room temperature
(approximately 15-30 minutes before use).
2. Prepare the reaction mix according to the manufacturer's
instructions provided in the G-6-PD assay kit.
3. Verify the calibration of the automated hematology analyzer
before running the test.
C. Analysis
1. Pipette the required volume of blood sample into the
designated test tube.
2. Add the specified volume of reagent to the sample, mixing
thoroughly.
3. Load the sample into the hematology analyzer, ensuring all set
parameters are correct.
4. Start the analysis according to the analyzer's instructions.
5. Record the start time.
D. Quality Control
1. Perform quality control checks using the provided control
reagents to ensure the accuracy of the test results.
2. Document all control readings, and take corrective actions if the
results fall outside the acceptable range.
E. Reporting Results
1. Retrieve the results from the analyzer and verify against
expected values and control results.
2. Document the results in the laboratory information system
(LIS).
3. If the results are outside the reference range, repeat the
analysis or take additional measures as per troubleshooting
guidelines.
6. REFERENCE INTERVALS Refer to the manufacturer’s guidelines
for specific reference intervals for G-6-PD levels.
7. QUALITY CONTROL/METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Follow the manufacturer’s insert for specific reagent limitations.
• Use internal QC material to verify accuracy after every new batch
of reagents is opened.
• Document any deviations and corrective actions taken.
8. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If the result is flagged by the analyzer, recheck the sample
preparation.
• Confirm that all reagents are within their expiration dates and
stored correctly.
• Verify proper function of the equipment used.
9. REPORTING VALUES
• Ensure all results are accurately entered into the LIS.
• Follow critical values reporting guidelines for G-6-PD deficiency.
