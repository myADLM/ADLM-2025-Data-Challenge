Protocol for GLUCOSE-6-PHOSPHATE DEHYDROGENASE
(G6PD) FULL GENE SEQUENCING
1. PURPOSE
This protocol outlines the steps for generating results for the full gene
sequencing of Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase (G6PD),
ensuring accurate and reliable results according to CLIA standards.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing the
sequencing and documenting the results. The supervisor must
ensure adherence to this protocol and address any deviations.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred Specimen:
◦ Peripheral blood collected in Ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid (EDTA) tubes.
Specimen Stability:
◦ Specimens must be stored at 2-8°C for up to 72 hours.
Unacceptable Specimen:
◦ Clotted specimens.
◦ Specimens collected in heparin or any other anticoagulant
except EDTA.
◦ Specimens arriving more than 72 hours post collection or at
inappropriate temperature conditions.
2. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
◦ Automated DNA Extraction System
◦ Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) Setup
◦ Sequencing Reagents (including primers specific for G6PD
gene)
◦ Thermal Cycler
◦ Sequencer (e.g., Illumina, Ion Torrent)
◦ Clean area for DNA handling
◦ Appropriate standard lab personal protective equipment
(PPE)
3. PROCEDURE
A) DNA Extraction:
1. Follow the automated DNA extraction protocol specific to
the extraction system to isolate DNA from blood
specimens.
2. Quantify and assess the purity of the extracted DNA using
spectrophotometry (e.g., NanoDrop).
B) PCR Setup:
1. Set up PCR for amplification of the entire G6PD gene
using specific primers.
2. Follow thermal cycler program as specified for the primers
in use (refer to manufacturer instructions).
3. Verify PCR amplification by gel electrophoresis to ensure
successful amplification.
C) Sequencing:
1. Prepare the PCR product for sequencing according to the
sequencer's protocol.
2. Load samples into the sequencer.
3. Run the sequencing program.
D) Data Analysis:
1. Analyze raw sequence data using bioinformatics tools
aligning against the reference G6PD gene sequence
(refer to the standard reference such as NG_009015).
2. Identify genetic variants, including point mutations,
insertions, deletions, and other relevant changes.
E) Validation and Verification:
◦ Validate sequencing data by ensuring >99% coverage of the
G6PD gene.
◦ Verify variant calls using secondary analysis software or
through manual inspection.
F) Quality Control:
1. Perform recurrent quality control checks including positive
controls, negative controls, and replicate sequencing.
2. Document results in QC logs, handle any discrepancies
according to lab protocols, and notify supervisor if results
fall outside acceptable limits.
4. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Compile the sequence data, noting detected variants.
2. Results will be reviewed and verified by a certified
technologist.
3. Report findings in the laboratory information system (LIS)
including notation of clinically significant variants
according to established nomenclature (e.g., HGVS).
5. REFERENCE INTERVALS
G6PD normal sequence: Reference sequence NG_009015. Match
against this sequence to define deviations.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to sequencer manufacturer guidelines regarding method
limitations, including potential issues with short-read sequencing
techniques and coverage gaps.
