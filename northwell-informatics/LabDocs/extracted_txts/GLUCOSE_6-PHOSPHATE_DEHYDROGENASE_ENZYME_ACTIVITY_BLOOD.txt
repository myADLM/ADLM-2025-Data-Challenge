Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
1. PURPOSE
To establish a standardized procedure for the measurement of
Glucose 6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase (G6PD) enzyme activity in
blood samples using spectrophotometric methods. This protocol
ensures accurate and reproducible results, maintaining compliance
with CLIA regulations.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the test
according to the protocol. Supervisors ensure staff competence,
monitor adherence to the procedure, and address any issues arising
during testing.
1. DEFINITION
G6PD enzyme activity test measures the function of the G6PD
enzyme in red blood cells, which is crucial for maintaining cellular
health by protecting red blood cells from oxidative damage.
Deficiency in G6PD can lead to hemolytic anemia.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Requirements
• Preferred/acceptable: Whole blood collected with EDTA
anticoagulant.
• Volume: Minimum 5 mL.
• Stability: Specimens should be kept refrigerated (2-8°C) and
processed within 7 days of collection.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens collected in tubes other than EDTA.
• Hemolyzed or clotted specimens.
• Specimens received outside of the stability timeframe.
B. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies
• Spectrophotometer
• Micropipettes and tips
• Centrifuge
• G6PD assay kit (containing all necessary reagents)
• Calibrated control samples
• Gloves, lab coat, and other personal protective equipment (PPE)
• Sample tubes (EDTA)
• Timer
C. Calibration and Quality Control
Calibration:
• Calibrate the spectrophotometer according to the manufacturer's
instructions before each batch of tests.
• Use calibration standards to ensure the accuracy of
measurements.
Quality Control:
• Perform the assay on control samples to verify assay
performance before analyzing patient samples.
• Run two levels of control (normal and deficient) with each batch of
tests.
• Document control results and troubleshoot any deviations.
D. Test Procedure
1. Specimen Preparation:
• Mix the whole blood sample thoroughly by gentle inversion.
• Aliquot a specific volume as required by the assay kit instructions.
1. G6PD Enzyme Assay:
• Prepare reagents according to the assay kit instructions.
• Pipette the required volumes of reagents and sample into wells or
cuvettes.
• Mix the reaction mixture gently and allow the reaction to proceed.
• Measure the absorbance at the specific wavelength indicated in
the assay kit instructions using the spectrophotometer.
• Record absorbance readings at designated times (typically initial
and after incubation).
E. Data Analysis
• Calculate G6PD enzyme activity using the absorbance readings
and reference data provided in the assay kit.
• Compare results to the validated reference ranges.
F. Reporting Results
• Enter the results into the laboratory information system (LIS)
along with appropriate quality control documentation.
• Review and verify the results before reporting.
• Follow site-specific guidelines for reporting critical values as
necessary.
G. Method Limitations
• The assay may be affected by hemolysis, high white blood cell
count, or certain medications; refer to the assay kit insert for
specific limitations.
• Ensure that controls are within acceptable limits before
proceeding with patient sample analysis.
