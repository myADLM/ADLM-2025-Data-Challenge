Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Glucose 6 Phosphate
Dehydrogenase Enzyme Activity, Blood - Analytical Phase
1. PURPOSE To outline the procedure for the analytical phase of
determining Glucose 6 Phosphate Dehydrogenase (G6PD) enzyme
activity in blood specimens in order to ensure accurate and reliable
results.
2. SCOPE This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel involved
in the performance, verification, and reporting of G6PD enzyme
activity testing.
3. RESPONSIBILITY All designated laboratory personnel are
responsible for adhering to the procedures outlined in this document
to ensure the accuracy and precision of G6PD enzyme activity
results.
4. DEFINITIONS G6PD Assay: A biochemical assay used to measure
the activity of the enzyme Glucose 6 Phosphate Dehydrogenase in
red blood cells.
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Whole blood collected in EDTA or heparinized
tubes.
• Volume: Minimum of 1 mL.
• Stability: Specimen is stable for 7 days at 2-8°C. Avoid freeze/
thaw cycles.
6. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Spectrophotometer or automated analyzer capable of measuring
absorbance at 340 nm
• Incubator set at 37°C
• G6PD reagent kit (refer to manufacturer's guidelines for storage
and preparation)
• Calibrators and controls of known G6PD activity
• Micropipettes and tips
• Test tubes or microcuvettes
• Centrifuge
7. CALIBRATION AND QUALITY CONTROL
• Calibrate the spectrophotometer or automated analyzer according
to the manufacturer's instructions.
• Run at least two levels of quality control (one normal, one
deficient) with each batch of patient samples.
• Document all QC results and ensure they fall within acceptable
ranges before proceeding with patient samples. Investigate and
resolve any out-of-range QC results before reporting patient
results.
8. PROCEDURE
8.1. PRE-ANALYTICAL PHASE
- Verify specimen integrity and labeling before analysis.
- If necessary, centrifuge the specimen at 1500-2000 x g for 10 minutes to separate plasma from red cells. Do not analyze hemolyzed specimens.
8.2. REAGENT PREPARATION
- Prepare G6PD reagent according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
- Allow reagents and samples to come to room temperature before proceeding.
8.3. SAMPLE PREPARATION
- Label a set of test tubes or microcuvettes for standards, controls, and patient samples.
- Add the appropriate volume of G6PD reagent to each tube.
- Add the appropriate volume of blood or calibrator to each tube and mix gently.
8.4. INCUBATION
- Incubate the reaction mixture at 37°C for a specified time based on the manufacturer's instructions (typically 10 minutes).
8.5. MEASUREMENT
- Measure the absorbance at 340 nm using a spectrophotometer or automated analyzer immediately after adding the reaction mixture.
- Record the absorbance readings.
9. CALCULATION OF RESULTS
• Calculate the G6PD activity level based on the change in
absorbance per minute, using the appropriate calibration factor
(refer to the manufacturer's instructions).
• Express the results in U/g of hemoglobin. Multiply the result by 60
to convert U/g Hb to U/L if required.
10. REPORTING RESULTS
• Enter the calculated G6PD activity values into the laboratory
information system (LIS).
• Validate and review the results. Ensure all critical values are
verified and annotated.
• Report final results following site-specific reporting guidelines.
11. REFERENCE RANGES
• Normal G6PD activity: 5.0-14.0 U/g Hb
• Deficient G6PD activity: <5.0 U/g Hb (Reference intervals may
vary depending on the population and method used. Refer to the
manufacturer’s instructions.)
12. QUALITY CONTROL
• Document all QC activities.
• Perform routine maintenance on all equipment according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
• Review QC data regularly to ensure consistent performance.
13. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Abnormally high leukocyte counts may interfere with results.
• Hemolysis may result in spurious results.
• Previous transfusion may affect the G6PD assay results.
14. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS
• Follow biosafety protocols for handling and disposing of biological
specimens.
• Wear appropriate PPE (gloves, lab coat, eye protection) when
handling reagents and specimens.
15. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions for the G6PD reagent kit.
• Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines for
enzyme assays.
16. DOCUMENT CONTROL
• Ensure this SOP is reviewed and updated regularly.
• Record any amendments to the procedure in the document
control section.
