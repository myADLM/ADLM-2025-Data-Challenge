Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Analytical Phase for
Generating Results for Glucose in Body Fluid
1. PURPOSE
To provide comprehensive guidelines for the analytical procedure
involved in generating glucose results from body fluid specimens.
This protocol ensures consistency, accuracy, and reliability of test
results.
1. SCOPE
This SOP applies to the analysis of glucose in body fluids (such as
cerebrospinal fluid, pleural fluid, peritoneal fluid, etc.) in the
laboratory. It is intended for use by laboratory personnel trained in the
analysis of these samples.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
Laboratory staff are responsible for:
• Adhering to this SOP to ensure the accuracy and reliability of test
results.
• Notifying the supervisor of any issues or deviations from the
protocol.
• Documenting all procedures, observations, and corrective actions
as per laboratory policy.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen Types:
• Body fluids (e.g., cerebrospinal fluid, pleural fluid, peritoneal fluid).
Specimen Collection and Handling:
• Collect body fluid specimens per standard collection procedures.
• Clearly label each specimen container with the patient’s
identification, specimen type, collection date, and time.
• Transport specimens to the laboratory promptly to prevent
deterioration.
Specimen Stability:
• Keep specimens refrigerated at 2-8°C if analysis is delayed.
• Ideally, analyze specimens within 2 hours of collection.
• If specimens must be stored, they are stable for up to 24 hours at
2-8°C.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens not properly labeled.
• Specimens with leakage or contamination.
• Specimens received beyond the stability limit without proper
storage conditions.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
Equipment:
• Automated chemistry analyzer (validated for glucose
measurement in body fluids).
• Timer.
• Centrifuge.
• Pipettes (calibrated).
• Refrigerators (for specimen storage).
Reagents:
• Glucose reagent (specified for use with the analyzer).
• Quality control materials (commercially prepared for glucose
assay).
• Calibrators (traceable to standard reference materials).
1. PROCEDURE
a. Preparation and Calibration:
1. Perform daily instrument maintenance as per manufacturer's
guidelines.
2. Calibrate the analyzer using commercially prepared calibrators
according to the manufacturer's instructions.
3. Document calibration results and ensure the analyzer is within
acceptable operating parameters before proceeding.
b. Quality Control:
1. Run quality control (QC) materials (at least two levels: normal
and high) with each run of patient specimens.
2. Verify that QC results fall within the acceptable range before
proceeding with patient specimen analysis.
3. Document all QC results. Take corrective action and notify the
supervisor if QC results are out of range.
c. Sample Processing:
1. Upon receipt, visually inspect the body fluid specimen for
labeling, integrity, and volume.
2. If the body fluid specimen is turbid, centrifuge it at 1500-2000
rpm for 10 minutes. Transfer the clear supernatant into a clean
tube.
3. Allow the specimen to come to room temperature before
analysis if it has been refrigerated.
d. Glucose Measurement:
1. Enter the patient and specimen information into the analyzer’s
system.
2. Pipette the appropriate volume of the body fluid specimen into
the sample cup or analyzer-specific container.
3. Load the specimen onto the automated chemistry analyzer.
4. Begin the analysis as per the instrument's operational
procedures.
5. Review results for each specimen upon completion of the
analyzer's run.
e. Result Verification:
1. Verify the results generated by the analyzer against expected
reference ranges and QC data.
2. Look for any analyzer flags or error codes that might indicate
issues with the sample or the run.
3. For results outside the reference range, review the sample and
QC data to ensure accuracy. Consider specimen re-analysis if
necessary.
4. REPORTING RESULTS
5. Document the final verified results in the laboratory information
system (LIS).
6. Ensure that any flagged or critical results are promptly
communicated to the appropriate healthcare provider per
laboratory protocol.
7. Apply specific comments or interpretive notes as needed based
on the results and clinical correlation.
8. MAINTENANCE
9. Perform and document routine maintenance on the analyzer as
specified by the manufacturer.
10. Address any maintenance alerts or issues immediately and
communicate these actions to supervisors.
11. Ensure proper inventory and storage of reagents and supplies
following laboratory guidelines.
