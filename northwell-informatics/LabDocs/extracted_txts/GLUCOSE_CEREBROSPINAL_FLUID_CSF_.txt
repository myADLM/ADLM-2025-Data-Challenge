Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Glucose in Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF)
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the accurate and reliable
analytical measurement of glucose levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
samples.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of designated laboratory personnel to adhere to
this SOP for CSF glucose analysis to ensure the quality and integrity
of the results.
1. DEFINITION
CSF glucose analysis involves the measurement of glucose levels in
the cerebrospinal fluid, which can provide important diagnostic
information regarding various medical conditions, including infections,
hemorrhages, and other neurological disorders.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Glucose reagent kit (e.g., Hexokinase method)
• Calibrators and Controls (commercially available)
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes and Pipette tips
• Incubator (if required by the method)
• Quality control material (e.g., low and high glucose controls)
• Automated chemistry analyzer (e.g., Roche COBAS c501 or
another validated analyzer)
• CSF collection tubes (e.g., sterile, no additives)
• Gloves and personal protective equipment (PPE)
• Logbooks and appropriate documentation forms
1. SPECIMEN HANDLING AND STABILITY
• Preferred/acceptable: Fresh CSF samples collected in sterile
tubes, received and processed within 1 hour of collection.
• Unacceptable:
◦ Samples with visible hemolysis or clotted specimens.
◦ Samples not received within the recommended timeframe or
improperly labeled specimens.
1. PROCEDURE
A) Sample Preparation:
1. Upon receipt, inspect the CSF sample for any visible
contamination or hemolysis. If the sample is not suitable,
contact the appropriate personnel for further action.
2. If necessary, centrifuge the sample at 1,500 x g for 10 minutes
to remove any cells or debris.
3. Transfer the clear supernatant into a clean labeled tube for
analysis.
B) Calibrator and Control Preparation:
1. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for preparing and
handling calibrators and quality control materials.
2. Ensure that all calibrators and controls are at room temperature
before use.
C) Instrument Calibration:
1. Perform calibration of the automated chemistry analyzer using
the glucose calibrators according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
2. Document the calibration results and verify that they fall within
acceptable ranges.
D) Quality Control:
1. Run the low and high glucose controls along with the patient
samples to ensure accuracy and precision.
2. Record the QC results in the appropriate logbook. Accept the
run only if the QC results are within the established limits. If QC
fails, troubleshoot and repeat until acceptable results are
obtained.
E) Glucose Measurement:
1. Load the patient samples, calibrators, and controls into the
chemistry analyzer.
2. Select the appropriate glucose test protocol on the analyzer.
3. Measure glucose levels in CSF samples as per the analyzer’s
instructions.
F) Review of Results:
1. Upon completion, review the results generated by the analyzer
for any flags or errors.
2. Compare the patient's results with the reference intervals
provided below to determine if they fall within normal ranges.
3. REFERENCE INTERVALS:
• Typical reference interval for CSF glucose: 60-80 mg/dL (3.3-4.4
mmol/L) (Note: Reference intervals may vary slightly based on the
specific analyzer and calibration materials used.)
1. REPORTING RESULTS:
• Enter the results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
Ensure that reports are verified by the designated technologist
before they are released.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
• Ensure that no interfering substances are present that could affect
the glucose measurement, like hemolysis, which may falsely
elevate results.
1. QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE:
• Perform routine maintenance and calibration as per instrument
guidelines.
• Participate in external quality assessment programs to evaluate
the lab’s performance periodically.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING:
• If results are flagged or appear inconsistent, re-run the quality
control material and the patient samples.
• If the instrument indicates any errors, follow the manufacturer's
troubleshooting guide and if unresolved, contact technical
support.
References:
• Manufacturer’s instructions for the glucose reagent kit and
automated chemistry analyzer.
• CAP or other accreditation guidelines on CSF glucose analysis.
• Laboratory safety manuals and potential hazard handling
protocols.
Ensure all laboratory staff are adequately trained and comply with
this SOP. Document all procedures, calibrations, and quality controls
on the appropriate log sheets provided in the laboratory.
