Standard Operating Procedure: Analytical Phase for GLUCOSE
CHALLENGE TEST, 50 G/1 HOUR (GESTATIONAL DIABETES
SCREEN), PLASMA
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to ensure the accurate and reliable
measurement of plasma glucose levels following the 50 g Oral
Glucose Challenge Test (OGCT) for gestational diabetes screening.
This procedure details the proper steps for processing and analyzing
patient specimens to provide valid results.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the
glucose measurement accurately according to this SOP.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring the procedure is
followed correctly and for addressing any issues that arise.
1. SPECIMEN
Preferred/Acceptable:
• Plasma from a fasting patient, collected one hour after ingestion
of a 50 g oral glucose solution.
Unacceptable:
• Specimens collected under non-fasting conditions.
• Specimens collected outside the specified time window (1 hour
post-glucose ingestion).
• Specimens with improper labeling or missing collection date/time
information.
• Specimens that show signs of hemolysis or gross contamination.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Automated glucose analyzer (e.g., Roche/Hitachi Cobas C
systems, Abbott Architect, etc.)
• Calibrated pipettes
• Centrifuge
• Collection tubes with anticoagulant (e.g., sodium fluoride/
potassium oxalate or lithium heparin)
• Glucose control materials (high and low)
• Glucose standards
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
1. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Processing:
1. Upon receipt, verify that the specimen meets acceptance
criteria.
2. Centrifuge the plasma collection tube at 1500-2000 g for 10-15
minutes to separate plasma from cells.
3. Transfer the clear plasma to a labeled secondary tube
inversely.
4. Validate specimen identity against patient records and
accession number.
5. If necessary, store plasma at 2-8°C for up to 24 hours or freeze
at -20°C for longer storage. Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
B. Glucose Measurement:
1. Set up and calibrate the automated glucose analyzer following
the manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Perform daily quality control using high and low glucose control
materials. Ensure these are within acceptable control limits
before proceeding.
3. Pipette the required volume of plasma specimen into the
analyzer’s sample cup.
4. Initiate the test run on the analyzer and document the time and
technician initials.
5. Allow the analyzer to process the sample and generate glucose
concentration results.
6. Review results for any flags or error codes. Repeat specimen
analysis if necessary.
C. Troubleshooting:
1. If the analyzer flags an error, consult the manufacturer's
troubleshooting guide.
2. If control results fall outside acceptable limits, recalibrate the
analyzer, repeat quality controls, and ensure no interfering
substances present.
3. For specimens showing unexpected glucose levels, review
patient history and sample integrity. If hemolysis or
contamination is detected, request a new specimen.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
Material:
• High and Low Glucose control materials from Kenlor Industries or
Biorad
• Stability: Ensure controls are within the expiry date and properly
stored at 2-8°C.
Procedures:
• Perform quality control testing at the start and end of each day or
every batch of specimens.
• Record control results following site-specific guidelines and
appropriate corrective actions documented.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results are automatically transmitted to the LIS (Laboratory
Information System).
• Technologist reviews and verifies results before release.
• Critical results are documented and communicated to the
requesting physician promptly.
• Flagged results or questionable sample integrity must be
addressed by referencing troubleshooting guidelines.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS AND CRITICAL VALUES
Reference Intervals for plasma glucose (50 g OGCT):
• Normal: less than 140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L)
• Elevated: 140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L) and greater indicates need for
further testing.
Critical Values:
• Plasma glucose above 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) – requires
immediate follow-up.
References:
• Manufacturer's Instructions for Use (IFU) for the analyzers being
employed.
• Clinical guidelines for gestational diabetes screening as
recommended by relevant health authorities.
Compliance with this SOP ensures the accurate and reliable
screening of gestational diabetes, contributing to better patient care
and outcomes.
