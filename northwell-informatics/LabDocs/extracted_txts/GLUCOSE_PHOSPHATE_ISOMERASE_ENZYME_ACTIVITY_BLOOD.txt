Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Glucose Phosphate
Isomerase (GPI) Enzyme Activity, Blood
1. PURPOSE:
To standardize the procedure for the measurement of Glucose
Phosphate Isomerase (GPI) enzyme activity in blood samples to
ensure accurate and consistent results.
2. SCOPE:
This procedure applies to all technical laboratory staff involved in the
measurement of GPI enzyme activity in clinical blood samples.
3. RESPONSIBILITY:
• Technical staff is responsible for performing the assay and
ensuring that all equipment is in proper working condition and
procedures are followed exactly as described.
• Supervisors are responsible for verifying results, validation of
equipment, and ensuring ongoing competency of technical staff.
4. SPECIMEN:
Acceptable:
• EDTA-anticoagulated whole blood (lavender top tube)
• Heparinized whole blood (green top tube)
Unacceptable:
• Clotted blood samples
• Hemolyzed samples
• Improperly labeled samples
Blood samples must be kept on ice and processed within 2 hours of
collection to ensure enzyme stability.
5. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS:
• Spectrophotometer with temperature control
• Centrifuge
• Micropipettes and tips
• Test tubes
• Ice bath
• G6P-(NADP+) nucleotides
• Buffer reagents: Tris buffer, pH 7.4
• G6PDH enzyme for coupled reaction
• Standard quality controls
6. PROCEDURE:
1. Sample Preparation:
◦ Centrifuge whole blood at 1000 x g for 10 minutes at 4°C to
separate plasma.
◦ Collect the plasma supernatant carefully without disturbing
the cell layer.
2. Reagent and Calibration Preparation:
◦ Prepare Tris buffer (0.05 M, pH 7.4) and store at 4°C.
◦ Prepare working G6P-(NADP+) reaction mixture: For each
reaction, add 1 mL of buffer, 50 µL of NADP+ solution (6
mmol/L), and 5 µL of G6PDH enzyme (2 U/mL).
◦ Verify the spectrophotometer calibration with standard
solutions.
3. Assay Procedure:
◦ Prewarm all reagents and samples to room temperature
(22-25°C) before the assay.
◦ In a test tube, mix:
▪ 500 µL of Tris buffer
▪ 200 µL of plasma sample or control
▪ 50 µL of G6P-(NADP+) reaction mixture.
◦ Mix thoroughly and incubate at 37°C for 5 minutes.
4. Measurement:
◦ Transfer the mixture to a cuvette suitable for
spectrophotometer use.
◦ Measure absorbance at 340 nm to monitor NADPH
formation.
◦ Record initial absorbance (A1) at time zero and final
absorbance (A2) at 5 minutes.
5. Calculation:
◦ Calculate the GPI enzyme activity using the formula: [
\text{GPI activity (U/L)} = \frac{(A2 - A1) \times \text{volume
in assay} \times 1000}{\text{extinction coefficient of NADPH}
\times \text{path length} \times \text{sample volume} \times
\text{time (min)}} ]
◦ The extinction coefficient of NADPH at 340 nm = 6.22 L/
(mmol*cm).
7. QUALITY CONTROL:
• Run commercial quality control samples (both normal and
abnormal) with each batch of patient samples.
• If QC results fall outside predetermined limits, review the entire
batch of results, investigate potential causes, and take corrective
actions prior to releasing any patient results.
8. REPORTING RESULTS:
• Record the enzyme activities along with sample identification on
the provided log sheets.
• Verify that the results fall within the expected reference interval for
the test:
◦ Normal reference range: 35-50 U/L
• Document any deviations, and for critical or anomalous results,
notify the requesting physician immediately as per established
laboratory protocol.
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
• Hemolyzed or improperly stored specimens can lead to incorrect
results.
• Proper maintenance of the spectrophotometer and precise timing
is imperative for accuracy.
