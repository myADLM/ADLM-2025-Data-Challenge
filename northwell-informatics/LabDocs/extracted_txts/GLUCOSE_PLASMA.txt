Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Title: Analytical Phase
Protocol for Generating GLUCOSE, PLASMA Results
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this SOP is to provide step-by-step
instructions for the accurate and reliable analysis of glucose levels in
plasma samples using an automated analyzer in the clinical
laboratory.
Responsibility: All laboratory staff performing glucose analysis are
responsible for following this SOP. It is the responsibility of the
supervisors to ensure adherence to this protocol and to address any
deviations or issues that arise during the analytical process.
2. PROCEDURE
Principle: Plasma glucose measurement is based on the enzymatic
method with glucose oxidase, which catalyzes the oxidation of
glucose to gluconic acid and hydrogen peroxide. This reaction results
in a measurable chromogenic compound proportional to the glucose
concentration in the sample.
Specimen Requirements:
• Preferred specimen: Plasma collected in lithium heparin or
sodium fluoride/potassium oxalate tubes.
• Volume: Minimum 1 mL of plasma.
• Stability: Specimens are stable for up to 7 days if stored at 2-8°C
or up to 24 hours at room temperature. For prolonged storage,
freeze at -20°C for up to 3 months.
Acceptable Specimen Conditions:
• Clear, non-hemolyzed samples.
• Properly labeled with patient identification, collection date, and
time.
Unacceptable Specimen Conditions:
• Grossly hemolyzed samples.
• Samples with insufficient volume.
• Samples collected in incorrect anticoagulant tubes.
• Samples with labeling discrepancies.
Equipment and Reagents:
• Automated Biochemistry Analyzer (e.g., Roche Cobas c501)
regularly maintained and calibrated.
• Glucose reagent kits specific to the analyzer.
• Quality Control (QC) materials: Low, Normal, and High glucose
levels.
• Calibrators provided by the reagent manufacturer.
Procedure:
1. Preparation:
1. Ensure the analyzer is ready for operation by verifying
daily maintenance checks have been completed.
2. Load the glucose reagent kit into the analyzer according
to the manufacturer’s instructions.
3. Verify that the QC materials and calibrators are within
their expiration dates and properly stored.
2. Calibration:
1. Run the calibrators as per the manufacturer's instructions.
2. Ensure that the calibration meets the required criteria
before processing patient samples. Troubleshoot any
calibration issues according to the manufacturer's
guidelines.
3. Quality Control:
1. Perform QC testing with each new lot of reagents, after
recalibration, and at the beginning of each shift.
2. Analyze QC materials (low, normal, high) and ensure
results fall within the established QC ranges. Document
and review QC results.
3. If QC fails, investigate the cause, resolve issues, and
rerun QC before patient testing.
4. Sample Analysis:
1. Centrifuge plasma samples at 1500-2000 x g for 10
minutes to separate plasma from cells if not already done.
2. Load plasma samples onto the analyzer rack as per the
manufacturer's specifications.
3. Input patient and sample identification into the analyzer
system.
4. Run the samples and monitor the analyzer for any flags or
errors during the testing process.
5. Retrieve and review the results, ensuring they are within
the reportable range.
5. Review and Result Reporting:
1. Review the generated results for accuracy and
consistency, comparing with QC results if necessary.
2. Validate and release results in the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
3. For critical glucose values (less than 2.5 mmol/L or
greater than 25 mmol/L), follow the established protocol
for immediate notification of the ordering physician.
Reference Intervals:
• Fasting Plasma Glucose: 4.0 – 5.9 mmol/L
• Random Plasma Glucose: Up to 7.8 mmol/L
Method Limitations:
• Hemolysis may falsely lower glucose values.
• High bilirubin levels may interfere with the colorimetric method.
• Inspect samples for clots and ensure proper sample collection
and handling.
References:
• Manufacturer’s instructions and user manual for the specific
biochemistry analyzer.
• Laboratory quality assurance and control guidelines.
• Current clinical guidelines for glucose testing and management.
Document Control: This SOP must be reviewed annually and
updated as necessary to comply with changes in laboratory
practices, regulations, or technology advancements. Ensure proper
documentation of any updates and retraining of laboratory personnel.
