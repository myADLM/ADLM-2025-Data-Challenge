Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for GLUCOSE, RANDOM,
SERUM Analysis
1. PURPOSE
To provide standardized procedures for the analysis of random serum
glucose in the laboratory ensuring accurate and reliable test results in
compliance with CLIA standards.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing serum
glucose analysis as defined in this protocol. This includes preparation
of samples, operation of analytical equipment, data recording, result
interpretation, and any necessary corrective actions.
1. DEFINITION
Random serum glucose refers to the measurement of glucose levels
in a serum sample collected at any time of the day without regard to
the time of the last meal. This analysis is crucial for diagnosing and
managing diabetes and other conditions affecting blood glucose
metabolism.
1. PROCEDURE
A) Specimen Requirements:
- Preferred Specimen: Serum collected in a gold-top serum separator tube (SST).
- Minimum Volume: 0.5 mL of serum.
- Collection: Ensure proper venipuncture technique to avoid hemolysis.
- Storage: Store at room temperature if analysis is to be performed within 2 hours. For longer storage, refrigerate at 2-8°C. Samples can be stored refrigerated for up to 7 days.
B) Equipment and Reagents:
- Glucose Analyzer: Ensure the analyzer is calibrated and validated according to manufacturer specifications.
- Reagents: Use only manufacturer-recommended reagents and controls.
- Centrifuge: Ensure it is properly maintained and validated.
- Timer: Standard laboratory timer.
- Gloves, pipettes, serum separator tubes (SST), and appropriate waste disposal containers.
C) Quality Control:
- Perform quality control checks with every batch of analysis using two levels of commercial quality control material (low and high glucose levels).
- QC Material: Store at 2-8°C. Allow to come to room temperature before use.
- If quality control results fall outside of established limits, troubleshoot, rectify, and rerun controls before analyzing patient samples.
D) Analytical Procedure:
1. Sample Preparation:
◦ Centrifuge the collected SST tube at 3000 RPM for 10
minutes.
◦ Carefully decant the serum without disturbing the cell layer.
Ensure the sample is free of hemolysis and lipemia.
2. Instrument Setup:
◦ Perform a daily calibration check before running patient
samples.
◦ Prepare glucose analyzer by following manufacturer’s
operation manual.
3. Running the Samples:
◦ Load patient samples and controls onto the glucose
analyzer according to manufacturer instructions.
◦ Start the analysis following the instrument procedure.
◦ Verify that the instrument logs the date, time, and ID of the
sample being analyzed.
E) Data Recording and Result Verification:
- Print results and check for any instrument flags or error messages.
- Ensure all results are within the expected reporting range. If any results fall outside, verify and rerun as necessary.
- Record results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS). Review and verify before reporting.
1. Reporting Results
◦ Results should automatically transmit to the LIS after
verification.
◦ Ensure reporting follows site-specific guidelines including
patient ID, date/time of analysis, and technologist’s initials.
Reference Intervals:
Normal range for random serum glucose: 70-140 mg/dL.
1. Method Limitations:
Refer to the manufacturer’s instrument manual for specific limitations
such as interfering substances that may affect glucose
measurements.
1. Corrective Actions:
◦ If a sample shows hemolysis, lipemia, or other
inconsistencies, request a new sample.
◦ If quality control fails, do not proceed with patient analysis
until the issue is resolved. Notify the supervisor if necessary.
