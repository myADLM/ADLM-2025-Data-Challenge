Standard Operating Procedure for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Urine Glucose (Random)
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized protocol for the analysis of random urine
glucose to ensure accurate and reliable results.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for
performing the urine glucose analysis following this standard
procedure. The supervisor must ensure adherence to the SOPs and
handle any deviations or issues that arise.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen:
• Preferred/acceptable: 10 mL freshly voided urine collected in a
clean, dry container.
• Unacceptable: Specimens collected more than 6 hours before
arrival at the laboratory, specimens without collection date/time
indicated, or specimens collected in containers with preservatives
that interfere with glucose analysis.
Specimen Storage and Stability:
• Store specimens at 2-8°C if not analyzed immediately.
• Bring refrigerated samples to room temperature prior to analysis.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Urine strip reader (e.g., Siemens CLINITEK Status)
• Timer
• Personal protective equipment
Reagents:
• Siemens Multistix 10SG or 8SG urine reagent strips
• Quality control materials (e.g., Biorad Liquichek Urinalysis)
Supplies:
• Clean, dry containers for urine collection
• Disposable gloves
• Cleaning wipes
1. PROCEDURE
Initial Preparation:
1. Ensure all materials and equipment are available and in
working order.
2. Wear appropriate personal protective equipment.
Quality Control:
1. Perform QC testing on each new bottle of Multistix 10SG or
8SG strips using the provided QC materials.
2. Record QC results and verify that results fall within acceptable
reference ranges before analyzing patient samples.
Test Procedure:
1. Mix the urine specimen gently.
2. Completely immerse the reagent strip in urine and remove
immediately. Avoid touching the reagent pads.
3. Draw the edge of the strip along the rim of the container to
remove excess urine.
4. Start the timer.
5. Wait for the specific time indicated for glucose reading (usually
30 seconds).
6. Compare the color of the glucose pad to the corresponding
color block on the strip container to determine glucose
concentration.
7. Record the result immediately.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
Reference Interval:
• Glucose: Negative (should appear as no color change)
Documentation:
1. Record the urine glucose result in the laboratory information
system (LIS) or logbook.
2. Include in the record: patient's name, date and time of
collection, date and time of analysis, result, and technologist’s
initials.
Interference and Limitations:
1. Refer to the Siemens Multistix 10SG or 8SG insert for individual
reagent pad limitations and possible interferences.
2. If the color of the test pad falls outside the expected range or if
interference is suspected, do not report a result. Instead, use
the comment ‘No result due to interference’.
3. QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE
Quality Control:
1. Include negative and positive QC with each batch of reagent
strips and each new bottle of strips.
2. Document and verify QC results; ensure they are within the
acceptable range before analyzing patient samples.
Corrective Actions:
1. If QC results are outside acceptable limits, troubleshoot the
issue by checking reagent expiration, storage conditions, and
equipment function.
2. If the problem persists, inform the supervisor and do not
proceed with patient testing until it is resolved.
