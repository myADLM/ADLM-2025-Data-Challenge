1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the protocol for the analysis and
generation of glucose results in spinal fluid specimens. This ensures
accuracy, reliability, and consistency in the test results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of designated laboratory personnel to perform
glucose analysis following the procedure outlined in this SOP. All staff
must ensure that analysis is conducted accurately and any
abnormalities or errors are reported to a supervisor immediately for
corrective action.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
• Specimen Type: Spinal fluid (Cerebrospinal Fluid, CSF).
• Preferred Collection Container: Red stopper tube.
• Volume: Minimum of 0.5 mL required.
• Stability:
◦ Room Temperature: Specimens should be processed
immediately.
◦ Refrigerated: If immediate processing is not possible,
specimens should be stored at 2–8°C and analyzed within 24
hours.
• Unacceptable Criteria:
◦ Specimens that have clotted.
◦ Specimens with contamination or incorrect labeling.
◦ Specimens received in inappropriate collection containers.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Analyzer: [Specify analyzer model and brand]
• Reagents: Glucose reagent kit [Include manufacturer's name and
catalog number]
• Supplies:
◦ Calibrated pipettes
◦ Centrifuge
◦ Red stopper tubes
◦ Sample rack
◦ Quality control materials
5. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Ensure all reagents, supplies, and equipment are prepared and
available.
2. Verify calibration status and perform necessary quality control
checks on the analyzer.
3. Review the specimen criteria to ensure all specimens meet the
acceptable conditions.
Analysis: 4. Centrifuge the red stopper tube containing the spinal
fluid specimen at [Specify RPM] for [Specify time] to clarify the
sample. 5. Carefully transfer the clear supernatant to a clean sample
container using a calibrated pipette. 6. Load the specimen into the
analyzer according to manufacturer’s instructions. 7. Select the
glucose test protocol on the analyzer.
Quality Control: 8. Run quality control samples, both positive and
negative, with each batch of tests according to site-specific
guidelines. 9. Compare quality control results with established target
values to ensure the analyzer is functioning correctly. 10. If the quality
control results fall outside acceptable limits, troubleshoot and resolve
issues before proceeding with patient specimens.
Result Generation: 11. Once the analysis is complete, the analyzer
will automatically generate results. 12. Review all results for accuracy
and completeness. 13. Verify and approve results before reporting.
Troubleshooting: 14. If a sample shows an error or abnormal result:
- Re-check the sample for hemolysis, clots, or any other
abnormalities. - Repeat analysis using fresh aliquots if necessary. -
Consult with a supervisor if issues persist.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
15. Results are automatically transmitted to the Laboratory
Information System (LIS). 16. All results must be verified and
reviewed by the technologist. 17. Critical results should be dealt with
according to the Critical Results policy, including immediate
notification to the appropriate clinical personnel.
7. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Glucose (CSF): 40–70 mg/dL
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Please refer to the glucose reagent kit's package insert for specific
limitations regarding the reagent pads and analyzer.
9. QUALITY CONTROL
Follow the site-specific quality control guidelines strictly for each
batch of glucose tests. Every new bottle of reagent should be
subjected to QC assessment.
10. REFERENCES
Refer to the manufacturer’s instruction manual for the analyzer and
the reagent kit’s package insert for detailed information.
