SOP Title: Glucose Tolerance Test, 100g/3 hour (Gestational
Diabetes Diagnostic), Plasma
1. PURPOSE
This procedure outlines the steps to be followed during the analytical
phase of the Glucose Tolerance Test (GTT) for the diagnosis of
gestational diabetes. The procedure ensures accurate and precise
results for glucose levels in plasma samples collected at specific time
intervals (fasting, 1 hour, 2 hours, and 3 hours) following the
ingestion of a 100g glucose solution.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of designated laboratory personnel to perform
the analytical phase of the Glucose Tolerance Test, ensuring
adherence to the outlined procedure, including any necessary quality
control and documentation protocols.
1. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
• Glucose analyzer
• Calibrated pipettes and tips
• Centrifuge
• Tubes for plasma sample collection (fluoride/oxalate or
heparinized tubes)
• 100g glucose solution
• Timer
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen type: Plasma collected in fluoride/oxalate or heparin tubes.
Specimen stability: Plasma must be separated from cells within 30
minutes of collection and kept at 2-8°C until analysis. Samples are
stable for up to 72 hours when refrigerated. Unacceptable
specimens: Specimens that are hemolyzed or not labeled with the
correct collection times.
1. PROCEDURE
5.1 Preparation
• Ensure the glucose analyzer is calibrated and in proper working
order. Run daily quality control (QC) checks using control samples
with known glucose concentrations.
• Verify the patient's fasting status before the test. The patient must
have fasted overnight (at least 8 hours).
5.2 Specimen Collection
• Collect the fasting blood sample (time 0). Label the tube with
patient information and "Fasting."
• Administer the 100g glucose solution to the patient. Start the
timer.
• Collect blood samples at 1 hour, 2 hours, and 3 hours after the
patient finishes drinking the glucose solution. Label each tube
with the corresponding time interval.
5.3 Plasma Separation
• Centrifuge each blood sample within 30 minutes of collection at
1500-2000 x g for 10 minutes.
• Carefully transfer the plasma to a new labeled tube. Refrigerate if
not analyzed immediately.
5.4 Glucose Measurement
• Set up the glucose analyzer according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
• Pipette the appropriate volume of plasma into the analyzer's
sample cup or insert tube directly into the analyzer.
• Perform glucose measurement for each specimen (fasting, 1
hour, 2 hours, 3 hours).
• Document results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
5.5 Quality Control
• Run QC samples at the beginning and end of each batch of
patient samples.
• If QC results fall outside the acceptable range, troubleshoot and
re-run QC samples before proceeding with patient samples.
5.6 Interpretation of Results
• Results are interpreted according to the following criteria for
gestational diabetes diagnosis:
◦ Fasting: ≥ 95 mg/dL (5.3 mmol/L)
◦ 1 hour: ≥ 180 mg/dL (10.0 mmol/L)
◦ 2 hours: ≥ 155 mg/dL (8.6 mmol/L)
◦ 3 hours: ≥ 140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L)
Diagnosis of gestational diabetes is made if two or more of these
values are met or exceeded.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Verify all results before releasing to the LIS.
• Record results in the patient's electronic medical record (EMR)
and ensure proper documentation.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolysis can affect glucose levels; ensure proper sample
handling to avoid hemolysis.
• Delayed plasma separation may result in erroneous glucose
readings.
