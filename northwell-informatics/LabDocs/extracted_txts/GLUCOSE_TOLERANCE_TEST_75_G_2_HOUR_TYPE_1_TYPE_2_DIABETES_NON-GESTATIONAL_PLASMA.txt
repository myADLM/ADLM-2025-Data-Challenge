Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Glucose Tolerance
Test, 75 G/2 Hour (Type 1/Type 2 Diabetes), Non-Gestational,
Plasma
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to outline the steps for performing a
75g/2-hour glucose tolerance test (GTT) for the diagnosis of Type 1
and Type 2 diabetes in non-pregnant patients. This test aims to
measure the body's ability to metabolize glucose by evaluating the
plasma glucose level before and after a glucose load.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of designated laboratory staff to perform and
document the glucose tolerance test according to the procedure
outlined. It is the responsibility of all laboratory staff to report and
address any issues or deviations from the protocol to the supervisor.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Patient Preparation:
• The patient should fast for at least 8-10 hours before the test, and
only water may be consumed during this fasting period.
• The patient should avoid smoking, alcohol, and vigorous exercise
before the test.
Preferred/Acceptable Specimens:
• Fasting blood sample collected in a fluoride oxalate (gray top)
tube.
• Additional blood samples collected at specified intervals (0
minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours) after a 75g oral glucose load.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Blood samples collected using incorrect anticoagulants (e.g.,
EDTA, heparin).
• Hemolyzed samples.
• Samples not labeled with proper patient identification.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• 75g glucose solution (Glucola)
• Fluoride oxalate (gray top) tubes
• Glucometer or automated chemistry analyzer capable of
measuring plasma glucose
• Timer or stopwatch
• Torniquet, needles, and other blood collection supplies
1. PROCEDURE
A. Pre-test Preparation:
1. Verify the patient's identity and eligibility for the test.
2. Ensure patient fasting status of 8-10 hours.
3. Explain the procedure to the patient and obtain informed
consent.
B. Specimen Collection:
1. Fasting Blood Collection (0 minutes):
◦ Collect a fasting blood sample in a fluoride oxalate (gray
top) tube.
◦ Label the sample with the patient's information and the time
of collection.
◦ Send the sample to the lab for plasma glucose
measurement.
2. Oral Glucose Load:
◦ Administer 75g of glucose solution (Glucola) orally within 5
minutes of collecting the fasting sample.
3. Timed Blood Collections:
◦ Collect additional blood samples in fluoride oxalate tubes at
1 hour (60 minutes) and 2 hours (120 minutes) post-glucose
ingestion.
◦ Label each sample with the patient's information and the
time of collection.
4. Post-collection Handling:
◦ Ensure all blood samples are immediately processed to
separate plasma.
◦ Store plasma at 2-8°C if analysis is delayed beyond 2 hours.
C. Glucose Measurement:
1. Using the glucometer or automated chemistry analyzer,
measure the plasma glucose levels in each sample (fasting, 1
hour, 2 hours).
2. Document the glucose levels and the time points accurately in
the lab management system.
3. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform quality control checks on the glucose meter or chemistry
analyzer before each test run.
• Ensure reagent and equipment calibrations are current.
• Use quality control materials at normal and pathological ranges to
ensure accuracy.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Record and report the plasma glucose concentrations for fasting,
1 hour, and 2 hours in the laboratory information system (LIS).
• Notify the ordering physician or healthcare provider of any critical
glucose values as per laboratory policy.
Reference Intervals:
• Fasting: <100 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L)
• 1-hour post-load: <180 mg/dL (10.0 mmol/L)
• 2-hour post-load: <140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L)
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolyzed samples can affect glucose levels; avoid hemolysis
during collection.
• Patient non-compliance with fasting or physical activity guidelines
can impact results.
