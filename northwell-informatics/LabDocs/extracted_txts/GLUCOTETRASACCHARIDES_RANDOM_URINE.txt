Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Glucotetrasaccharides, Random, Urine
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized protocol for the analysis of
glucotetrasaccharides in random urine samples, ensuring accuracy
and consistency in results.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing
the analysis, documenting the process, and reporting the results.
• Supervisors must ensure compliance with this SOP and address
any issues that arise during the procedure.
1. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel involved in the
analysis of glucotetrasaccharides in urine and pertains to all random
urine samples received for this test.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
• Preferred Specimen:
◦ 10-20 mL of random urine collected in a sterile container.
• Stability:
◦ Specimens should be analyzed within 24 hours of collection if
refrigerated (2-8°C) or within 4 hours if kept at room
temperature (15-25°C).
1. REAGENTS AND EQUIPMENT
• High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) system or
equivalent analytical device calibrated for glucotetrasaccharides
detection.
• Calibrators and controls for glucotetrasaccharides.
• Mobile phase appropriate for HPLC analysis.
• Reagents and solvents of HPLC grade.
• Sterile urine collection containers.
• Logbook for documentation.
1. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation
• Ensure that all reagents, equipment, and instruments are
prepared according to the manufacturer’s guidelines.
• Verify that calibrators and controls are within their expiration date
and have been stored appropriately.
B) Calibration and Quality Control
• Run system calibration using glucotetrasaccharides standards at
the beginning of each day.
• Perform quality control checks with high and low
glucotetrasaccharides control solutions.
• Document all calibration and quality control activities in the
logbook.
C) Sample Preparation
• Mix the urine sample thoroughly to ensure homogeneity.
• (If needed) Centrifuge the urine sample at 1500 g for 10 minutes
to remove any particulate matter.
• Transfer an aliquot of the urine sample into an HPLC-compatible
vial.
D) Analytical Process
1. Load the vials containing the standards, controls, and urine
samples onto the HPLC carousel.
2. Set up the HPLC system with the appropriate method for
glucotetrasaccharides analysis.
3. Initiate the HPLC run, ensuring that the correct sequence for
standards, controls, and samples is followed.
4. Monitor the HPLC run to ensure that the system is functioning
correctly and no errors are indicated.
E) Data Analysis
• After the run, use the HPLC software to analyze the
chromatograms.
• Identify glucotetrasaccharides peaks based on retention times
and compare with calibrators.
• Quantify the concentration of glucotetrasaccharides in the urine
samples using the calibration curve generated with the standards.
F) Result Verification and Documentation
• Review the data to ensure quality control results fall within
acceptable ranges.
• Compare the new results with the control samples to ensure
precision and accuracy.
• Enter the glucotetrasaccharides concentrations and any pertinent
comments in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Document all findings, QC results, and any anomalies in the
logbook.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Report glycolytic tetrasaccharides concentrations in the
appropriate units (e.g., μmol/L).
• Reference intervals and critical values, if established, should be
included in the report.
• Document and report any critical values following laboratory
policy.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Reference intervals can be obtained from the literature or derived
from in-house validation studies. These intervals should be clearly
indicated in the LIS and the final report.
1. QUALITY CONTROL AND LIMITATIONS
• Adhere to quality control procedures outlined in this SOP and
relevant manufacturer’s instructions.
• Be aware of possible interfering substances or factors that may
affect the accuracy of the test (e.g., improper specimen handling,
degraded reagents).
• Revalidate the method periodically and after any significant
changes to the procedure or instrumentation.
1. REFERENCES
Reference published literature, product inserts for reagents and
controls, and equipment manuals for detailed procedures and
specific test limitations.
10. REVISION HISTORY
Document any changes to the protocol as they occur to ensure
continual improvement and accuracy in laboratory procedures.
Important Note: This protocol is intended as a general guideline.
Institution or laboratory-specific requirements, guidelines, and safety
protocols should be incorporated accordingly.
