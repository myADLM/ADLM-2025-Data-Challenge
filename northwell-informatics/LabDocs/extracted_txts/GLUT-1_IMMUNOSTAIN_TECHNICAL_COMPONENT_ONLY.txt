Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for GLUT-1 Immunostain,
Technical Component Only
1. PURPOSE
This SOP describes the procedure for performing GLUT-1
immunostaining on tissue samples. GLUT-1 immunostain is used to
identify glucose transporter protein 1, which is utilized in the
diagnostic evaluation of various malignancies.
Responsibility:
• All designated laboratory personnel must follow this SOP to
ensure accurate and reliable staining results.
• Supervisors must ensure adherence to this procedure and to
identify and rectify any issues in the process.
2. DEFINITION
GLUT-1 (Glucose Transporter 1) is an immunohistochemical stain
used for detecting the presence of the GLUT-1 protein in tissue
sections.

4. PROCEDURE
A. Pre-Staining Preparation:
1. Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
◦ Place the slides containing formalin-fixed, paraffin-
embedded tissue sections in a slide rack.
◦ Immerse slides in three changes of xylene for 5 minutes
each.
◦ Rehydrate slides by passing them through graded ethanol
solutions: 100% ethanol (2 changes, 3 minutes each), 95%
ethanol (1 change, 3 minutes), 70% ethanol (1 change, 3
minutes), and rinse in running tap water.
2. Antigen Retrieval:
◦ Perform antigen retrieval using the appropriate buffer
(usually citrate buffer, pH 6.0, or EDTA buffer, pH 8.0).
◦ Heat the slides in a microwave or pressure cooker
according to the manufacturer's instructions for the buffer
used.
◦ Allow slides to cool to room temperature in the retrieval
buffer, then rinse in PBS.
B. Immunostaining Procedure:
1. Blocking:
◦ Incubate the tissue sections in a blocking reagent (e.g., 5%
normal serum) for 10 minutes to reduce nonspecific binding.
2. Primary Antibody Incubation:
◦ Apply GLUT-1 primary antibody to the tissue sections at the
dilution recommended by the manufacturer.
◦ Incubate the slides in a humidity chamber for the time
specified by the primary antibody’s datasheet (generally 1
hour at room temperature).
3. Wash:
◦ Rinse the slides in PBS three times for 2 minutes each.
4. Secondary Antibody Incubation:
◦ Apply the HRP-conjugated secondary antibody to the tissue
sections.
◦ Incubate in a humidity chamber for 30 minutes at room
temperature.
5. Wash:
◦ Rinse the slides in PBS three times for 2 minutes each.
6. Visualization:
◦ Prepare the DAB substrate solution according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
◦ Apply DAB substrate solution to the slides and incubate until
the desired staining intensity is achieved (generally 2-5
minutes).
7. Counterstain:
◦ Immerse slides in hematoxylin for 1 minute to counterstain
the nuclei.
◦ Rinse slides in running tap water until the water runs clear.
◦ Differentiate in 0.3% acid alcohol, blue in ammonia water,
and rinse in running tap water.
8. Dehydration and Clearing:
◦ Dehydrate slides by passing through graded ethanol
solutions: 70% ethanol (1 change, 2 minutes), 95% ethanol
(1 change, 2 minutes), 100% ethanol (2 changes, 2 minutes
each).
◦ Clear in three changes of xylene for 5 minutes each.
9. Mounting:
◦ Apply mounting medium and coverslip.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run positive and negative controls with each batch of slides.
• Document all control results to verify the stain's performance.
• Record any deviations from this SOP and inform the supervisor
immediately.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
The slides are now ready for microscopic analysis. Record and store
the images and observations according to laboratory protocols. Only
designated pathologists are authorized to interpret and sign out the
immunostained tissue sections.
7. REFERENCES
Include references to specific datasheets and manufacturer's
instructions for each reagent or piece of equipment used in this SOP.
This concludes the SOP for GLUT-1 immunostain, technical
component only. Review and ensure adherence to this procedure to
maintain high standards of immunohistochemical staining within the
laboratory.
