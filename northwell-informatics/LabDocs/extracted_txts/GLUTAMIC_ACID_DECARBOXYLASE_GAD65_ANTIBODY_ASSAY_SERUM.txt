SOP for Glutamic Acid Decarboxylase (GAD65) Antibody Assay,
Serum
1. PURPOSE To outline the procedure for the analytical phase of
testing serum for Glutamic Acid Decarboxylase (GAD65)
antibodies using commercially available assay kits.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for
performing the assay according to the outlined protocol and ensuring
that all steps are completed accurately and documented
appropriately.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
• Preferred specimen: Serum.
• Collection: Collect blood in a serum separator tube.
• Processing: Allow the blood to clot and then centrifuge the
specimen to separate serum.
• Storage: Serum specimens can be stored refrigerated at 2-8°C for
up to 7 days or frozen at -20°C for longer periods. Avoid repeated
freeze-thaw cycles.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or contaminated specimens.
• Specimens collected in anti-coagulant tubes such as EDTA,
heparin, or citrate.
1. PROCEDURE A) Preparation:
• Ensure all reagents, controls, and samples are equilibrated to
room temperature before beginning the assay.
• Use a calibrated micropipette throughout the procedure.
• Refer to the product insert for specific reagent preparation
instructions.
B) Assay Setup:
1. Label the appropriate number of microtiter wells based on the
number of standards, controls, and patient samples.
2. Add the standards, controls, and patient samples into the
respective wells according to the assay kit instructions.
3. If necessary, dilute the serum specimens as specified in the
manufacturer’s insert.
C) Incubation and Washing:
1. Add the specific conjugate provided in the kit to each well.
2. Incubate the wells for the specified time at room temperature or
as directed by the manufacturer's protocol.
3. Wash the wells using the washing solution or by the method
specified in the kit, ensuring thorough removal of unbound
material.
D) Detection:
1. Add substrate solution to each well.
2. Incubate as specified in the protocol.
3. Measure the reaction intensity using a plate reader set to the
appropriate wavelength detailed in the kit's insert.
E) Interpretation:
1. Calculate the results using the standard curve generated from
the assay.
2. Record the results and compare them with established
reference intervals provided by the kit manufacturer.
3. REPORTING RESULTS
• Ensure all results are reviewed and verified by a qualified
technologist.
• Report results according to the laboratory’s LIS system.
• Critical values or abnormal results should be flagged and reported
following standard laboratory procedures.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include quality control samples with each batch of assays.
• QC materials should be processed and evaluated according to
the site-specific quality protocols.
• Document all QC results and ensure they fall within acceptable
ranges before releasing patient results.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS Refer to the assay kit insert for specific
limitations and interferences that may affect the test results.
2. REFERENCES
• Specific product insert for the commercially available GAD65
antibody assay kit.
• Laboratory quality control and standards guidelines.
1. PROCEDURE REVIEW
• This procedure should be reviewed annually or as needed when
updates in assay methods or equipment occur.
