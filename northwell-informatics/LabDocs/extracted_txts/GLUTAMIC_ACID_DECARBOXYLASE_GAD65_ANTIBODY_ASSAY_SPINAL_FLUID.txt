1. PURPOSE
The protocol delineates the procedures for performing Glutamic Acid
Decarboxylase (GAD65) Antibody Assay on spinal fluid specimens to
ensure accurate and reliable results.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel responsible for carrying
out the GAD65 Antibody Assay on spinal fluid within the designated
CLIA-certified laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
Laboratory personnel are responsible for performing the assay
according to this SOP, recording all observations, and alerting the
supervisor of any inconsistencies or abnormal findings.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen Type:
• Spinal fluid (Cerebrospinal fluid, CSF) collected in sterile, screw-
capped container.
Accepted Conditions:
• Specimens should be transported to the laboratory immediately
after collection.
• Specimens must be kept refrigerated at 2-8°C and are stable for
up to 48 hours.
Unacceptable Conditions:
• Specimens arriving in the laboratory more than 48 hours after
collection.
• Specimens with visible contamination or hemolysis.
• Specimens with leaking or improperly sealed containers.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• ELISA or chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA) analyzer
• Calibrated micropipettes
• Controls: GAD65 Antibody Positive Control, Negative Control, and
Standard Solutions
• GAD65 Antibody ELISA Kit or CLIA Kit
• Test tubes and reagents outlined in the kit’s insert
• Storage at 2-8°C for reagents and controls
6. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Ensure all reagents and controls are stored and brought to
room temperature as specified by the manufacturer’s
instructions.
2. For ELISA or CLIA, refer to the manufacturer’s insert for
specific preparation instructions.
Assay Setup:
1. Controls and Standards:
◦ Prepare positive, negative controls, and standard curve
according to the vendor’s instructions.
2. Sample Preparation:
◦ Mix the spinal fluid sample gently.
◦ Use calibrated micropipettes to aliquot required volumes of
the control, standards, and samples into the designated
wells or tubes.
3. Incubation and Washing Steps:
◦ Follow the assay protocol for incubation times,
temperatures, and washing steps ensuring minimal cross-
contamination.
4. Detection:
◦ Apply detection reagents as per assay protocol.
◦ Measure absorbance or signal readout using ELISA or CLIA
analyzer according to instrument instructions.
Quality Control:
1. Ensure the proper function of analyzers by running controls with
each assay batch.
2. Validate that control readings fall within the expected range
before considering sample results valid.
3. Record any deviations and follow troubleshooting steps as
outlined in SO maintain sample integrity and reliability.
Recording and Reporting Results:
1. Data Entry:
◦ Enter manually or automatically the measured absorbance
or signal into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
2. Analysis:
◦ Compare patient results with standard curve to determine
GAD65 antibody levels in the spinal fluid.
3. Verification:
◦ Review results for consistency and validate accuracy by
cross checking control results.
4. Documentation:
◦ Record all findings, issues, corrective actions, and reviewer
initials.
5. Sign-Off:
◦ Results must be signed off by a technologist.
Reference Intervals:
Refer to the assay kit insert for the normal reference range values for
GAD65 antibodies. If no established range is provided, investigate
literature and clinical guidelines.
7. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to kit-specific limitations provided by the manufacturer,
including interference factors, cross-reactivity, sensitivity, and
specificity.
