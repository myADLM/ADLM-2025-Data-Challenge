Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for Glutamine
Synthetase Immunostain, Technical Component Only
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized method for performing and documenting
the technical component of the Glutamine Synthetase Immunostain
test in order to ensure consistent, accurate, and reproducible results.
Responsibility:
1. Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing
the Glutamine Synthetase Immunostain procedure.
2. All staff must ensure proper handling, processing, and
documentation of the specimens.
3. Supervisors are responsible for reviewing and signing off on
completed test results.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Accepted Specimens:
• Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks.
• Unstained tissue sections on charged slides (4-5 microns thick).
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Dehydrated or poorly fixed tissues.
• Tissue sections that are not properly labeled or are damaged.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES:
Equipment:
• Automated immunostainer or manual staining setup.
• Microtome.
• Water bath.
• Laboratory oven or slide warmer.
Reagents and Supplies:
• Primary antibody against Glutamine Synthetase.
• Detection kit (e.g., Dako EnVision or equivalent).
• Positive and negative control slides.
• Xylene, Ethanol (absolute and 95%).
• Deparaffinization solution.
• Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) for counterstaining (optional).
• Mounting medium and coverslips.
• Quality control materials.
4. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Ensure all reagents and control materials are ready and within
expiry date.
2. Prepare a water bath at 40-45°C.
3. Pre-warm slides on a slide warmer at 60°C for 20-30 minutes.
Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
1. Deparaffinize slides in xylene:
◦ 2 changes, 5-10 minutes each.
2. Rehydrate slides through graded ethanol:
◦ 100% ethanol: 2 changes, 5 minutes each.
◦ 95% ethanol: 2 changes, 5 minutes each.
◦ Rinse in distilled water for 5 minutes.
Antigen Retrieval:
1. Perform antigen retrieval using a predetermined method (e.g.,
heat-induced epitope retrieval in citrate buffer pH 6.0 or Tris-
EDTA buffer pH 9.0) according to manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Allow slides to cool to room temperature in the buffer.
3. Rinse slides in distilled water followed by TBS or PBS wash
buffer for 5 minutes.
Staining Procedure:
1. Block endogenous peroxidase activity using 3% Hydrogen
Peroxide for 10 minutes.
2. Wash slides in TBS or PBS buffer for 2 changes, 5 minutes
each.
3. Apply primary antibody against Glutamine Synthetase and
incubate at room temperature for 30-60 minutes (as optimized).
4. Wash slides thoroughly in TBS or PBS buffer, 2 changes, 5
minutes each.
5. Apply secondary antibody or detection reagent and incubate as
per the manufacturer's instructions.
6. Wash slides in TBS or PBS buffer, 2 changes, 5 minutes each.
7. Apply chromogen (e.g., DAB) and monitor the development of
the color reaction under a microscope.
8. Rinse slides in distilled water to stop the reaction.
Counterstaining (Optional):
1. Counterstain slides with Hematoxylin for 30 seconds to 1
minute.
2. Rinse slides in distilled water.
3. Blue slides in weak ammonia or running tap water for 1-2
minutes.
4. Dehydrate slides through graded ethanol (95% and 100%).
5. Clear slides in xylene.
Mounting:
1. Apply mounting medium and coverslip.
2. Allow slides to dry thoroughly before examination or storage.
5. QUALITY CONTROL:
1. Include positive and negative control slides with each batch
stained.
2. Document the use of control slides and results.
3. Compare the staining intensity and pattern to ensure
consistency. If discrepancies are identified, troubleshoot and
repeat staining if necessary.
6. REPORTING RESULTS:
• Results of the technical component will be documented, including
any staining observations.
• Slides along with documentation will be forwarded to the
pathologist for interpretation and final reporting.
• Include any notes regarding deviations from the standard protocol
or any issues encountered during staining.
7. REFERENCES:
1. Manufacturer’s Instructions for Primary and Secondary
Antibodies.
2. Quality Control Guidelines for Immunohistochemistry.
3. Relevant laboratory Standard Operating Procedures for
Immunostaining.
8. DOCUMENTATION AND REVIEW:
1. Document all steps taken and observations in the laboratory
logbook.
2. Ensure that the procedure and any deviations are reviewed and
signed off by the laboratory supervisor.
3. Review and update this SOP annually or as needed to
incorporate new methods or changes to the procedure.
