STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE
GLUTARIC ACIDURIA TYPE II GENE PANEL ANALYSIS
1. PURPOSE
To define the procedure for the analytic phase of generating results
for Glutaric Aciduria Type II Gene Panel testing. This analysis
involves the identification of mutations in specific genes responsible
for Glutaric Aciduria Type II, as an aid to the diagnosis and
management of the disorder.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all personnel involved in the analysis and
testing for Glutaric Aciduria Type II Gene Panel in a CLIA-certified
laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the laboratory scientists to adhere to this
SOP. It is the responsibility of the laboratory supervisor or designee
to ensure compliance and documentation.
4. SPECIMEN
Preferred Specimen:
• 3-5 mL of peripheral whole blood collected in an EDTA tube
(lavender top)
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Specimens that are clotted, hemolyzed, improperly labeled, or
collected in non-EDTA containers
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• DNA extraction kit (e.g., Qiagen, Promega)
• PCR thermocycler
• DNA sequencing instrument (e.g., Illumina or equivalent)
• Nuclease-free water
• Primers specific for the target genes involved in Glutaric Aciduria
Type II
• PCR reagents (dNTPs, Taq polymerase, MgCl2, buffer)
• Agarose gel electrophoresis apparatus and agarose powder
• Ethidium bromide or alternative DNA stain
• Sequencing reagents and consumables
6. PROCEDURE
A) DNA Extraction:
1. Perform DNA extraction from 200-500 µL of whole blood using
the preferred DNA extraction kit as per the manufacturer’s
protocol.
2. Quantify and assess the quality (A260/280 ratio) of the
extracted DNA using a spectrophotometer or equivalent.
3. Store the extracted DNA at -20°C until ready for use.
B) PCR Amplification:
1. Design primers specific to the genes associated with Glutaric
Aciduria Type II.
2. Prepare PCR reactions as follows:
◦ DNA template: 50-100 ng
◦ Forward and reverse primers: 0.2-0.5 µM each
◦ dNTPs: 200 µM each
◦ Buffer with MgCl2: as per the enzyme manufacturer’s
recommendation
◦ Taq polymerase: 0.5-1.0 units
◦ Nuclease-free water: to a total reaction volume of 50 µL
3. Program the thermocycler with the cycling conditions:
• Initial denaturation: 95°C for 2 minutes
• 35 cycles of: a. Denaturation: 95°C for 30 seconds b. Annealing:
55-60°C for 30 seconds (depending on primer Tm) c. Extension:
72°C for 1 minute per kb of target
• Final extension: 72°C for 5 minutes
1. Confirm amplification by running 5 µL of the PCR product on a
1.5% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide.
C) Sequencing:
1. Purify the PCR products using a PCR purification kit or gel
extraction method.
2. Quantify the purified PCR product using a spectrophotometer or
equivalent.
3. Prepare the sequencing reactions according to the instrument’s
protocol using dye terminator sequencing chemistry.
4. Run the sequencing reactions on the designated sequencing
instrument following the manufacturer’s protocol.
7. DATA ANALYSIS
1. Process raw sequencing data using bioinformatics tools to align
sequences and identify variants.
2. Compare variants to known databases such as ClinVar, dbSNP,
and the Human Gene Mutation Database to identify pathogenic
mutations.
3. Interpret the results in the context of Glutaric Aciduria Type II,
considering known pathogenicity and clinical correlations.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Include positive controls (known mutation-positive samples)
and negative controls (no-template controls) in each run.
2. Ensure all equipment is calibrated, and preventive maintenance
is up to date.
3. Document all steps, including any deviations from the SOP, in
the laboratory information system (LIS).
9. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Review sequencing data for consistency and accuracy before
reporting.
2. Report detected variants along with their pathogenicity
classification.
3. Reference to known mutation databases and clinical
implications should be included in the final report.
4. Results must be reviewed by a laboratory director or a qualified
designee before release.
