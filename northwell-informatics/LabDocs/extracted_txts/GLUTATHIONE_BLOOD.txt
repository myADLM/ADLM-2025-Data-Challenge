Standard Operating Procedure
Title: Analytical Phase of Generating Results for Glutathione in
Blood
1. Purpose:
To ensure accurate and reliable determination of glutathione levels in
blood specimens through established laboratory processes and
procedures.
2. Scope:
This protocol covers the analytical steps to generate results for
glutathione levels in blood specimens. It is applicable to all laboratory
personnel trained in handling and processing these specimens.
3. Responsibility:
All laboratory personnel assigned to measure glutathione levels in
blood specimens are responsible for adhering to this SOP.
4. Specimen Requirements and Stability:
Acceptance Criteria:
• Specimen must be collected in an EDTA or heparinized tube.
• Minimum sample volume: 3 mL whole blood.
• Specimen must be kept on ice, processed within 30 minutes of
collection or stored at -80°C for up to 1 month.
Unacceptable Criteria:
• Samples collected in tubes other than EDTA or heparinized tubes.
• Specimens not kept on ice and processed outside the 30-minute
window.
• Specimens showing signs of hemolysis or clotting.
5. Equipment, Reagents and Supplies:
• Centrifuge
• pH meter
• Pipettes
• Glass or Plastic Vials
• Spectrophotometer/Fluorometer
• Assay Kits for Glutathione (e.g., commercial kits containing
necessary reagents such as monochlorobimane (MCB), buffer
solutions, and internal standards)
6. Procedure:
Sample Preparation:
1. Thaw frozen blood samples on ice. Maintain samples chilled.
2. Centrifuge whole blood at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes at 4°C to
separate plasma.
3. Transfer the supernatant to clean vials, avoiding mixing with the
buffy coat and red cells.
4. Prepare reagents and standards as described in the kit's
instructions.
Assay Procedure:
1. Reaction Setup:
◦ Pipette the required volume of plasma (e.g., 100 µL) into the
reaction tube.
◦ Add the assay buffer to standardize the pH (if necessary,
adjust with HCl or NaOH).
2. Derivatization of Glutathione:
◦ Add monochlorobimane (MCB) reagent to the plasma to
derivatize glutathione. This reagent binds to glutathione
forming a fluorescent compound.
3. Incubation:
◦ Incubate the reaction mixture at 37°C for 30 minutes.
Protect samples from light during incubation.
4. Measurement:
◦ Measure the fluorescence or absorbance of the derivatized
glutathione using a spectrophotometer or fluorometer.
Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for the device
regarding settings and wavelengths (typically, excitation at
380 nm and emission at 470 nm for fluorescents).
5. Calculation:
◦ Calculate the concentration of glutathione in the blood using
the standard curve generated with known concentrations of
glutathione standards.
7. Quality Control:
Internal QC:
• Use at least two levels of quality control material (low and high) to
verify assay performance.
• Run QC samples with each batch of patient samples.
• Record and track QC results. Investigate and take appropriate
corrective action if QC results fall outside the pre-defined
acceptable limits.
Assay Validation:
• Perform a minimum of five replicates of quality control materials to
establish standard curves and determine inter-assay variability.
• Validate all new batches of assay kits and reagents according to
the manufacturer’s instructions.
8. Reporting Results:
• Ensure that results are transmitted to the LIS and reviewed by the
technologist.
• Report results as µmol/L or mg/dL of glutathione.
• Flag any critical values according to laboratory policy.
9. Reference Intervals:
• Establish reference intervals by running control samples and refer
to kit insert or existing literature.
◦ Typical reference interval for glutathione: 200 – 400 µmol/L.
10. Method Limitations:
• Ensure adequate sample volume and quality.
• Avoid exposure of specimens and reagents to light as this may
affect fluorescence.
• Interference from hemolysis or clotting may impact the accuracy
of results.
11. Troubleshooting:
• If QC fails, review reagent preparation and equipment calibration,
re-run QC samples.
• Validate the spectrophotometer/fluorometer settings for accuracy.
12. References:
• Manufacturer’s assay kit insert.
• Literature on glutathione measurement and analysis.
This SOP ensures accurate and consistent analysis of glutathione
levels in blood specimens to support clinical diagnostics and
research activities within the laboratory.
