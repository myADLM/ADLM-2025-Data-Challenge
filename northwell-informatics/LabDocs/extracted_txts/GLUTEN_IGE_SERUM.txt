Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase:
Gluten, IgE Assay (Serum)
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized protocol for the analytical phase in
generating results for Gluten-specific Immunoglobulin E (IgE) in
human serum samples.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel involved in the
processing and analysis of serum samples for the detection and
quantitation of Gluten-specific IgE using an immunoassay technique.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of designated laboratory staff to:
• Perform the analysis according to this SOP.
• Ensure accuracy and precision of test results.
• Report any deficiencies or malfunctions to the supervisor
immediately.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND HANDLING
Specimen Type: Serum Specimen Volume: Minimum 2 mL of
serum Stability and Storage:
• Serum samples should be refrigerated at 2-8°C and are stable for
up to 7 days.
• For long-term storage, serum samples should be frozen at -20°C
or colder.
Unacceptable Conditions:
• Specimens with visible hemolysis or lipemia.
• Specimens collected in incorrect anticoagulant tubes other than
plain or SST.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Centrifuge
• Micropipettes and tips
• Incubator set to 37°C
• Immunoassay analyzer (e.g., ELISA reader)
Reagents:
• Gluten-specific IgE enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
kit, compliant with manufacturer instructions.
• Wash buffers, substrate solution, and stop solution.
Supplies:
• ELISA plates
• Laboratory-grade water
• Disposable gloves
• Lab coats
• Absorbent paper
6. PROCEDURE
Sample Preparation:
1. Allow serum samples to reach room temperature.
2. Mix each serum sample thoroughly before testing to ensure
homogeneity.
ELISA Assay Procedure:
1. Prepare all reagents, controls, and samples as instructed by the
ELISA kit manufacturer.
2. Add appropriate volume (as specified in kit instructions) of
controls, standards, and serum samples to the wells of the
ELISA plate.
3. Incubate the plate at 37°C for the specified time to allow binding
(typically 1-2 hours).
4. Wash the wells thoroughly with the provided wash buffer
according to the kit instructions (usually 4-5 washes).
5. Add the detection antibody or reagent to each well.
6. Incubate the plate again at 37°C for the time specified by the
manufacturer.
7. Repeat the washing step.
8. Add substrate solution to each well and incubate for the
specified time.
9. Add stop solution to halt the reaction.
10. Read the plate using an ELISA reader at the optical density
(OD) specified in the kit (typically 450 nm).
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run positive and negative controls alongside each assay batch.
• Ensure that the control results fall within the acceptable range
provided by the control materials’ accompanying documentation.
• If controls are outside of this range, do not report patient results,
and rerun the assay after addressing any issues.
• Record all QC data in the designated QC log.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Calculate the concentration of Gluten-specific IgE in each sample
using the standard curve generated from the known standards.
• Results should be reported in kU/L as per kit instructions.
• Review and verify all results for accuracy and consistency with
QC before reporting.
• Any critical results or those requiring immediate clinical attention
should be promptly communicated to the responsible medical
personnel following the Critical Result Reporting Policy.
9. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• The reference interval for Gluten-specific IgE should be
determined based on the normal population range provided by the
kit manufacturer and/or validated by the lab.
• Typical intervals may range from undetectable to low levels for
non-allergic individuals but should be established and revised
periodically by the lab.
10. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to the ELISA kit insert for specific limitations regarding
sensitivity, specificity, and potential interferents.
• Cross-reactivity with other cereal proteins may occur and should
be considered when interpreting results.

12. REVISION LOG
Document any changes and updates to this SOP here, including the
date and nature of the changes.
This SOP ensures that all personnel consistently follow standardized
procedures and protocols for accurate and reliable results in the
analysis of Gluten-specific IgE in serum samples.
