Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Gluten IgG Results
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the procedure for the analysis of Gluten IgG
antibodies in human serum to assist in the diagnosis of gluten
sensitivity or celiac disease.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for following this
SOP for analyzing, troubleshooting, documenting, and reporting
Gluten IgG results.
2. DEFINITION
Gluten IgG antibodies are immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies
targeted against gluten proteins. Their presence in the blood may
indicate gluten sensitivity or celiac disease.
3. PROCEDURE
3.1. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies
• Equipment:
◦ Microplate reader capable of measuring absorbance at the
appropriate wavelength (typically 450 nm)
◦ Incubator (37°C)
◦ Laboratory standard pipettes (manual or automated)
◦ Centrifuge
◦ Vortex mixer
• Reagents:
◦ Gluten IgG ELISA Kit (includes calibrators, controls, and
conjugate)
◦ Wash buffer
◦ Sample diluent
◦ Substrate solution
◦ Stop solution
• Supplies:
◦ Microplates
◦ Disposable pipette tips
◦ Microcentrifuge tubes
◦ Absorbent paper
3.2. Specimen Requirements and Stability
• Specimen Type: Human serum
• Specimen Volume: Minimum 200 µL
• Storage Conditions:
◦ Store at 2-8°C for up to 7 days if not immediately processed.
◦ Store at -20°C or lower for long-term storage.
• Unacceptable Specimens:
◦ Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples
◦ Incorrectly labeled specimens
◦ Specimens that have undergone repeat freeze-thaw cycles
3.3. Assay Procedure
1. Preparation:
◦ Allow all reagents, controls, and patient samples to reach
room temperature (18-25°C) before use.
◦ Prepare wash buffer as per the kit instructions.
◦ Set up the microplate reader to measure absorbance at the
specified wavelength.
2. Sample Dilution:
◦ Dilute patient serum samples 1:100 in sample diluent
(unless specified otherwise by the manufacturer’s
instructions).
3. Assay Procedure:
◦ Add 100 µL of calibrators, controls, and diluted patient
samples to the designated wells in duplicate.
◦ Incubate the plate at 37°C for 1 hour.
◦ Wash the wells 5 times with wash buffer.
◦ Add 100 µL of conjugate to each well.
◦ Incubate the plate at 37°C for 30 minutes.
◦ Wash the wells 5 times with wash buffer.
◦ Add 100 µL of substrate solution to each well.
◦ Incubate the plate in the dark at room temperature for 15
minutes.
◦ Add 100 µL of stop solution to each well to terminate the
reaction.
4. Reading the Plate:
◦ Measure the absorbance of each well at 450 nm using a
microplate reader within 30 minutes of stopping the reaction.
3.4. Calculation and Interpretation of Results:
• Generate a standard curve from the absorbance of the calibrators
using appropriate software.
• Quantify the Gluten IgG concentration in patient samples by
comparing their absorbance with the standard curve.
• Report results in U/mL or as specified by the manufacturer (refer
to the kit insert for cut-off values).
3.5. Quality Control:
• Perform quality control for each assay by running at least two
levels of controls (positive and negative) as specified by the
manufacturer.
• Ensure that control results are within the established range. If
controls are out of range, troubleshoot the assay before
processing patient samples.
3.6. Troubleshooting:
• Refer to the manufacturer’s kit insert for common troubleshooting
steps.
• Issues such as high background, low signal, or failed controls
must be documented and addressed by reassessing reagent,
equipment function, and procedure steps.
3.7. Reporting Results:
• Results must be reviewed and verified by the technologist before
entry into the LIS.
• Follow site-specific reporting guidelines to ensure correct result
documentation.
3.8. Maintenance:
• Routine maintenance of laboratory equipment should be
performed as per laboratory SOPs to ensure reliable and accurate
results.
• Document all steps and corrective actions taken for
troubleshooting.
4. SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS
• Follow all bloodborne pathogen safety protocols when handling
human samples.
• Wear appropriate PPE (lab coat, gloves, and eye protection)
when performing the assay.
• Dispose of biohazardous waste according to the facility’s disposal
protocols.
