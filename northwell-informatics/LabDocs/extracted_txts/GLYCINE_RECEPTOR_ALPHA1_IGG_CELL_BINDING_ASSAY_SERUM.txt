1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the proper procedure for the
analytical phase of generating results for Glycine Receptor Alpha1
IgG, Cell Binding Assay, Serum. This document ensures accuracy,
precision, and consistency in test performance and results reporting.
1. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel involved in the
Glycine Receptor Alpha1 IgG, Cell Binding Assay.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of trained laboratory personnel to conduct the
assay and report results as per this SOP. It is the responsibility of the
supervisor to ensure this SOP is followed and maintained.
1. SPECIMEN
Acceptable Specimen:
• Serum collected in serum separation tubes (SST) or plain red-top
tubes.
• Centrifuge and aliquot serum to a labeled tube if required.
• Store and transport serum at 2-8°C up to 72 hours post-collection
or freeze at -20°C for long-term storage.
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
• Specimens collected in tubes other than serum separation tubes
(SST) or plain red-top tubes.
• Samples stored at incorrect conditions.
1. MATERIALS
• Glycine Receptor Alpha1 IgG testing kit/cell binding assay kit
• Microtiter plates
• Cell culture reagents and medium
• Calibrated pipettes
• Incubator (37°C, 5% CO2)
• Automated plate washer or manual wash bottles
• ELISA reader (with appropriate filter settings)
• Software for data analysis
1. REAGENTS
• Primary antibody reagents specific for Glycine Receptor Alpha1
• Secondary detection reagents (HRP-conjugated or fluorescent
labels)
• Blocking solution
• Washing buffer (PBS-Tween or equivalent)
• Substrate reagent for HRP (TMB or equivalent)
• Stop solution for HRP substrate (sulfuric acid or equivalent)
1. PROCEDURE
Pre-Analytical Phase: Ensure that specimens are properly collected,
stored, and labeled as described in section 4.
Analytical Phase:
1. Preparation:
◦ Bring all reagents and specimens to room temperature
before starting the assay.
◦ Prepare a sufficient number of microtiter wells for standards,
controls, and patient samples.
◦ Dilute cell culture reagents, blocking solution, and washing
buffer according to the kit instructions.
2. Cell Culture:
◦ Seed the appropriate cell line in the microtiter plate and
allow cells to adhere overnight in an incubator set at 37°C
and 5% CO2.
◦ Wash cells with washing buffer to remove any non-adherent
cells.
3. Assay Performance:
◦ Add blocking solution to each well and incubate for 1 hour at
room temperature.
◦ Wash the wells three times with washing buffer.
◦ Add diluted patient serum samples, standards, and controls
to the appropriate wells.
◦ Incubate for 1 hour at room temperature to allow binding.
◦ Wash the wells three times with washing buffer to remove
unbound serum.
◦ Add the primary antibody specific for Glycine Receptor
Alpha1 to each well and incubate for 1 hour at room
temperature.
◦ Wash the wells three times with washing buffer.
◦ Add secondary detection reagent (HRP-conjugated or
fluorescent) to each well and incubate for 1 hour at room
temperature.
◦ Wash wells with washing buffer.
4. Signal Development and Measurement: For HRP-conjugated
detection:
◦ Add the substrate reagent (e.g., TMB) to each well and
incubate in the dark for the recommended time (typically
15-30 minutes).
◦ Add the stop solution to each well to halt the reaction.
◦ Measure the optical density (OD) at the appropriate
wavelength (typically 450 nm) using an ELISA reader.
For Fluorescent detection:
◦ Ensure proper handling and reading settings for the
fluorochrome used.
◦ Measure fluorescent signals on a fluorescence reader.
Post-Analytical Phase:
1. Data Analysis:
◦ Use the appropriate software to analyze the OD or
fluorescence readings.
◦ Plot a standard curve from the assay standards and derive
the concentration of Glycine Receptor Alpha1 IgG in patient
samples.
◦ Ensure all readings and calculations are reviewed and
validated for consistency and accuracy.
2. Quality Control:
◦ Include positive and negative controls in each assay run.
◦ Results for controls must fall within the established range for
the assay to be valid.
◦ Repetition of the assay may be necessary if controls do not
meet criteria.
3. REPORTING RESULTS
4. Verification:
◦ Verify the assay results against controls and standards.
◦ Review and validate any outlier data or replicate variances.
5. Reporting:
◦ Report the quantitative results in the laboratory information
system (LIS).
◦ Include a reference range and interpretive comments if
necessary.
