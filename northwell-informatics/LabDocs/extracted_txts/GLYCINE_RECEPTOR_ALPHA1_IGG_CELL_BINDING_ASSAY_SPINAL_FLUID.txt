1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to provide a detailed protocol for the
analytical phase of processing and generating results for Glycine
Receptor Alpha1 IgG, Cell Binding Assay (CBA) in spinal fluid
specimens. This protocol ensures consistent, accurate, and reliable
laboratory testing for the detection of Glycine Receptor Alpha1 IgG
antibodies.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel involved in the
analysis of Glycine Receptor Alpha1 IgG using the cell binding assay
method.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory personnel to follow
this SOP as written and to report any deviations or issues to the
laboratory supervisor or manager.
4. MATERIALS AND REAGENTS
Reagents:
• Fixed Glycine Receptor Alpha1 expressing cells
• Glycine Receptor Alpha1 negative control cells
• Fluorescently labeled secondary antibodies (anti-human IgG)
• Washing buffer (PBS or equivalent)
• Blocking solution (typically BSA or similar)
• Mounting medium
• Positive control cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sample with known
Glycine Receptor Alpha1 IgG antibodies
• Negative control CSF sample
Equipment:
• Fluorescence microscope with appropriate filter sets
• Incubator, 37°C
• Humidified chamber for incubation steps
• Micropipettes and tips
• 96-well plates or appropriate containers for cell culture
• Coverslips (if using microscopy slides)
• Laboratory timer
5. PROCEDURE
5.1 Preparation
1. Thaw and prepare all reagents according to manufacturer’s
instructions and laboratory guidelines.
2. Prepare the cell cultures of Glycine Receptor Alpha1
expressing cells and control cells in 96-well plates.
5.2 Sample Handling
1. Ensure that the CSF specimens have been properly collected,
received, and accessioned.
2. Vortex the CSF samples briefly and centrifuge at low speed
(400 x g for 5 minutes) to remove any debris.
3. Aliquot the required volume for analysis and store the rest at
-80°C if further testing is needed.
5.3 Cell Binding Assay
1. Blocking:
◦ Incubate the cells with blocking solution for 1 hour at room
temperature to prevent non-specific binding.
2. Primary Antibody Incubation:
◦ Add 50 µL of patient CSF sample to the wells containing
Glycine Receptor Alpha1 expressing cells and control cells.
◦ Include positive and negative control samples in the assay.
◦ Incubate the plates in a humidified chamber at 37°C for 1
hour.
3. Washing:
◦ Wash the cells three times with washing buffer to remove
unbound antibodies.
4. Secondary Antibody Incubation:
◦ Add 50 µL of fluorescently labeled anti-human IgG
secondary antibody to each well.
◦ Incubate in a dark humidified chamber at 37°C for 1 hour.
5. Washing:
◦ Wash the cells three times with washing buffer to remove
unbound secondary antibodies.
6. Imaging and Data Acquisition
1. Mount the cells with an appropriate mounting medium if using
microscopy slides.
2. Observe the cells under a fluorescence microscope and acquire
images.
3. Ensure the microscope settings are consistent for all samples
for comparative analysis.
7. Analysis and Interpretation
1. Analyze the fluorescence intensity of the Glycine Receptor
Alpha1 expressing cells compared to the control cells.
2. A positive result is indicated by bright fluorescence, signifying
the presence of Glycine Receptor Alpha1 IgG antibodies in the
CSF sample.
3. A negative result shows no significant fluorescence or similar
fluorescence intensity as the negative control.
8. Reporting Results
1. Document all findings accurately in the laboratory information
system (LIS).
2. For positive results, report as “Presence of Glycine Receptor
Alpha1 IgG antibodies detected in a cell binding assay.”
3. For negative results, report as “No Glycine Receptor Alpha1
IgG antibodies detected in the cell binding assay.”
4. Ensure results are reviewed and verified by a qualified
laboratory technologist following proper QC protocols.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Perform quality control checks with each assay run using
positive and negative control samples.
2. Ensure all equipment is calibrated and maintained according to
laboratory standards.
3. Document any deviations and corrective actions taken during
the assay.
7. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer instructions for reagents and equipment.
• Current literature on Glycine Receptor Alpha1 IgG CBA methods.
8. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS
1. Follow standard laboratory safety protocols.
2. Handle all human samples as potential biohazards.
3. Properly dispose of all waste materials according to laboratory
guidelines.
This SOP is to be reviewed annually and updated as necessary to
comply with new guidelines and techniques in the field.
