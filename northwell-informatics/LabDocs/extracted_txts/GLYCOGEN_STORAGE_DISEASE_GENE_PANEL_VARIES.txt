Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Glycogen Storage
Disease Gene Panel Testing
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedure for performing
the Glycogen Storage Disease (GSD) Gene Panel testing. This test
identifies pathogenic variants in genes associated with Glycogen
Storage Disease. The procedure outlines the steps from DNA
extraction to the generation of test results.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all designated staff members performing
molecular genetic testing for the Glycogen Storage Disease Gene
Panel within the clinical laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITIES
It is the responsibility of the designated lab personnel to perform the
procedure as outlined and to document all procedures and results
accurately. All staff must adhere to quality control and quality
assurance guidelines to ensure the accuracy of the test results.
4. DEFINITIONS
GSD Genes: Include but are not limited to G6PC, PYGM, PHKG2,
AGL, SLC37A4, etc.
5. MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT
• Molecular-grade water
• Pipettes and tips
• Microcentrifuge tubes
• DNA extraction kit
• Quantification equipment (e.g., Nanodrop, Qubit)
• PCR reagents and primers specific for GSD genes
• Thermal cycler
• Agarose gel electrophoresis equipment
• NGS (Next Generation Sequencing) platform
• Bioinformatics tools and software for data analysis
6. PROCEDURE
6.1 DNA Extraction
1.1 Receive properly collected and labeled blood or tissue samples.
Verify patient information and sample integrity. 1.2 Extract genomic
DNA using a commercially available extraction kit following the
manufacturer's instructions. 1.3 Measure DNA concentration and
quality using a spectrophotometer (e.g., Nanodrop) or a fluorometer
(e.g., Qubit). 1.4 Ensure DNA has an A260/A280 ratio of 1.8–2.0.
Document the concentration and quality in the laboratory information
system (LIS).
6.2 PCR Amplification
2.1 Design primers for target regions of GSD-associated genes or
use a commercially available GSD gene panel kit. 2.2 Prepare PCR
reaction mixtures for each target region as follows:
• DNA template: 20–50 ng
• PCR master mix: 1X
• Forward primer: 0.2 µM
• Reverse primer: 0.2 µM
• Molecular-grade water: up to the final volume of 25 µL
2.3 Perform PCR under the following cycling conditions:
• Initial denaturation: 95°C for 5 minutes
• Denaturation: 95°C for 30 seconds
• Annealing: 60°C for 30 seconds
• Extension: 72°C for 1 minute
• Final extension: 72°C for 5 minutes
Cycle repeat: 35 cycles
2.4 Include positive controls (known GSD samples) and negative
controls (no DNA template) in each run.
6.3 PCR Product Verification
3.1 Run 5 µL of PCR products on a 2% agarose gel alongside a DNA
ladder. 3.2 Verify the presence of amplicons at expected sizes. 3.3
Clean PCR products using a suitable PCR purification kit.
6.4 Library Preparation and NGS
4.1 Using a commercially available NGS library preparation kit,
prepare libraries from the purified PCR products as per the
manufacturer’s instructions. 4.2 Quantify and normalize the libraries.
4.3 Pool the libraries together and load onto the sequencer following
the standard sequencing workflow.
6.5 Data Analysis
5.1 Use bioinformatics software to align sequence reads to the
human reference genome (e.g., hg19 or hg38). 5.2 Identify variants
using variant calling software. 5.3 Annotate variants and generate a
variant report. 5.4 Cross-reference identified variants with known
pathogenic variants in databases (e.g., ClinVar, HGMD).
6.6 Result Interpretation and Reporting
6.1 Interpret results, considering the patient’s clinical information and
family history. 6.2 Draft a comprehensive report, including findings,
methodology, limitations, and recommendations for genetic
counseling or further testing if necessary. 6.3 Review and sign-off by
a clinical geneticist or a qualified laboratory director. 6.4 Release the
report to the ordering physician through the standard reporting
system.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform reagent and equipment calibration as scheduled.
• Include quality control samples in each batch to ensure accuracy
and reliability.
• Document all deviations and address technical issues promptly.
8. SAFETY
• Follow laboratory safety protocols, including the use of PPE
(personal protective equipment).
• Handle chemicals and biological samples according to safety
guidelines.
9. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions for the DNA extraction and NGS
library preparation kits.
• Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines.
• Relevant peer-reviewed articles on GSD gene analysis.
