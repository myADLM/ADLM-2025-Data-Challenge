SOP - Analytical Phase of Generating Results for GlycoMark® Test
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this Standard Operating Procedure
(SOP) is to outline the protocol for the analytical phase of
generating results for the GlycoMark® test. This statement
ensures the quality, consistency, and accuracy of the test
results for short-term glucose management in patients.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the
analytical assays and documenting results accurately. Supervisors
are responsible for reviewing the procedures and ensuring
compliance. It is the responsibility of all staff to report any issues or
anomalies observed during the analytical phase to the supervisor
immediately.
1. DEFINITION The GlycoMark® test measures 1,5-
anhydroglucitol (1,5-AG), a marker reflecting short-term
glycemic control. It is particularly useful for identifying
postprandial glucose excursions in patients with diabetes.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS Specimen Type: Preferred:
Serum or plasma Acceptable: EDTA plasma, heparinized
plasma
Specimen Collection and Handling: Collect specimen in a proper
collection tube. Avoid hemolysis; if hemolysis occurs, recollect the
specimen. Specimens can be stored at 2-8oC for up to 7 days or
frozen at ≤-20oC for long-term storage. Specimen should be brought
to room temperature and mixed gently before analysis.
Unacceptable Specimens: Specimens that are significantly
hemolyzed. Clotted specimens. Specimens collected in sodium
fluoride (NaF) tubes.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES GlycoMark®
reagent kit (includes assay calibrators, quality control materials)
Calibrated pipettes Microcentrifuge Spectrophotometer or
automated chemistry analyzer compatible with GlycoMark®
reagent kits. Incubator maintained at 37oC
2. PROCEDURE Reagent Preparation: Prepare reagents,
calibrators, and quality control materials as per manufacturer
instructions. Reagents and controls must reach room
temperature before use.
Calibration and Quality Control: Calibrate the analyzer according to
the manufacturer's instructions. Run quality control samples (low,
medium, high) to validate the calibration. If QC falls outside the
accepted range, repeat analysis. If still unacceptable, recalibrate and
reanalyze the controls.
Sample Analysis: Ensure sample is at room temperature. Centrifuge
specimen at 1500-2000 x g for 10 minutes if not previously
centrifuged. Label sample cups for identification. Pipette appropriate
sample volume into the labeled cups. Load samples and appropriate
reagents into the analyzer. Start the analysis according to the
equipment standard procedures.
1. RESULT REPORTING Results are automatically generated by
the analyzer. Verify the results against the quality control
criteria. Enter results into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS). Review and authorize results. Flag any abnormal results
according to clinical guidelines. Notify relevant healthcare
provider of critical values according to institutional policy.
Reporting Reference Intervals: Adults (18 years and older): 10-30 µg/
mL Children (2-17 years): Not established; interpret results with
caution and in consultation with a pediatric endocrinologist.
1. QUALITY CONTROL Internal Quality Control: Analyze quality
control samples with each batch of clinical specimens.
Document all QC results. Investigate and resolve any out-of-
range QC results before reporting patient results.
Interlaboratory Comparisons: Participate in inter-laboratory QC
samples twice yearly. Compare results to identify systematic errors or
biases.
1. POTENTIAL INTERFERENCE AND LIMITATIONS Interpret
GlycoMark® results in the context of the patient's clinical
condition. High concentrations of hepatic metabolites, uric acid,
or certain medications may interfere with the assay.
2. DOCUMENTATION AND RECORD-KEEPING Maintain records
of: Calibration and quality control runs. Patient test results.
Corrective actions taken for out-of-control situations.
3. REFERENCES GlycoMark® reagent kit insert. Clinical and
Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines for Endocrine
Testing. Institutional and manufacturer guidelines for the
analytical instruments used.
By adhering to this SOP, laboratory staff will ensure the accurate and
reliable generation of GlycoMark® test results, supporting the
effective management of patients' short-term glucose control.
