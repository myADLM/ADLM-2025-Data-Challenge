Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Glycophorin A
(CD235a) Immunostain, Technical Component Only
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the steps required for the technical execution of
Glycophorin A (CD235a) immunostaining of tissue samples to ensure
consistent and reliable results. This procedure does not include
interpretation or diagnostic analysis.
Responsibility:
• The histotechnologist is responsible for performing the staining
procedure.
• The laboratory supervisor is responsible for ensuring adherence
to this protocol and addressing any issues that arise.
2. MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT NEEDED
• Glycophorin A (CD235a) antibody
• Positive and negative control tissue
• Tissue samples (fixed and embedded in paraffin)
• Microtome
• Water bath
• Microscope slides
• Xylene
• Absolute ethanol (100% and 70%)
• Distilled water
• Heat-induced epitope retrieval (HIER) buffer
• PBS (phosphate-buffered saline)
• Blocking solution
• Secondary antibody (if needed)
• Chromogen substrate (e.g., DAB)
• Hematoxylin
• Mounting medium
• Coverslips
• Oven/incubator (37°C)
• Microscope
3. PROCEDURE
3.1 PREPARATION OF REAGENTS:
1. Prepare 1x PBS by diluting the 10x PBS stock solution with
distilled water.
2. Prepare the Glycophorin A primary antibody according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
3. Prepare the blocking solution as per the recommendation in the
antibody datasheet.
3.2 SPECIMEN AND CONTROL PREPARATION:
1. Section the paraffin-embedded tissue blocks at 4 micrometers
using a microtome.
2. Place the sections onto microscope slides and allow them to
adhere in a 37°C oven for 1 hour.
3. Deparaffinize the slides in 3 changes of xylene, 5 minutes each.
4. Rehydrate the slides through a series of ethanol washes (100%
and 70%) followed by washing in distilled water.
3.3 ANTIGEN RETRIEVAL:
1. Perform heat-induced epitope retrieval (HIER) using the
appropriate buffer (e.g., citrate buffer, pH 6.0) in a water bath at
95-98°C for 20 minutes.
2. Allow the slides to cool for 20 minutes at room temperature.
3.4 IMMUNOSTAINING PROCEDURE:
1. Wash slides in 1x PBS for 5 minutes.
2. Block endogenous peroxidase activity by treating slides with
3% hydrogen peroxide in methanol for 10 minutes.
3. Rinse slides in 1x PBS for 5 minutes.
4. Apply the blocking solution to each slide and incubate for 30
minutes at room temperature to prevent non-specific binding.
5. Drain the blocking solution and apply the Glycophorin A primary
antibody to each slide. Incubate in a humidified chamber at
room temperature for 1 hour or overnight at 4°C (depending on
antibody specifications).
6. Rinse slides in 1x PBS for 5 minutes.
7. Apply the secondary antibody (if necessary) and incubate
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
8. Rinse slides in 1x PBS for 5 minutes.
9. Apply the chromogen substrate (e.g., DAB) and develop color
according to the manufacturer's instructions, typically for 3-10
minutes.
10. Rinse slides in distilled water.
3.5 COUNTERSTAINING AND MOUNTING:
1. Counterstain with hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes.
2. Rinse slides in running tap water for 5 minutes.
3. Dehydrate through graded ethanol solutions (70%, 100%).
4. Clear in 3 changes of xylene, 5 minutes each.
5. Coverslip using a mounting medium.
4. QUALITY CONTROL:
• Include positive control tissue known to express Glycophorin A
(e.g., normal erythroid tissue).
• Include negative control slides where the primary antibody is
omitted.
• Document any deviations from standard procedure in the lab log.
5. REPORTING RESULTS:
• Once staining is complete and coverslips are applied, the slides
are reviewed under a microscope for staining quality.
• The results are then logged and provided to the pathologist/
clinical team for interpretation.
6. REFERENCES:
• Manufacturer’s instructions for Glycophorin A primary antibody.
• General immunohistochemistry protocols from standard histology
textbooks.
7. ATTACHMENTS:
Include all relevant forms for documentation, such as antibody lot
tracking, QC logs, and equipment maintenance records.
This SOP ensures that the Glycophorin A (CD235a) immunostaining
procedure is performed consistently and accurately to produce
reliable results for clinical diagnostics.
