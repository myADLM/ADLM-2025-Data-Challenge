Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Glycyphagus domesticus (House Dust Mite)
IgE, Serum
1. PURPOSE This SOP outlines the procedure for the analytical
phase of generating results for Glycyphagus domesticus IgE
antibodies in serum specimens using an automated
immunoassay analyzer.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for
performing, documenting, and reviewing the analytical procedure to
ensure accurate and timely results.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen Type:
• Serum
Specimen Collection:
• Preferred: Serum separator tube (SST)
• Acceptable: Red top tube without anticoagulants
Specimen Volume:
• Minimum volume: 1 mL
Specimen Handling:
• Serum should be collected, clot completely, and centrifuged within
2 hours of collection.
• Transfer the serum to a clean labeled transport tube if collected in
a red top tube.
• Store the serum at 4-8°C if analysis is not performed immediately.
Serum is stable for up to 7 days under refrigeration.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Automated immunoassay analyzer (e.g., ImmunoCAP, Allergy
Testing system)
Reagents:
• Glycyphagus domesticus-specific IgE immunoassay kit,
compatible with the analyzer
Supplies:
• Calibrators and controls specific to the Glycyphagus domesticus
IgE assay
• Pipettes and disposable tips
• Laboratory timer
• Centrifuge
1. PROCEDURE
A. Pre-Analytical Check:
• Verify specimen integrity and appropriate labeling (patient
identification, collection date/time).
• Ensure sample volume meets the minimum requirement.
• Confirm the specimen type (serum) and rejection criteria (e.g.,
hemolysis noted, incorrect specimen type).
B. Calibration and Quality Control:
• Run calibrators specific to Glycyphagus domesticus IgE as per
manufacturer’s instructions.
• Perform quality control using both positive and negative controls.
QC procedure should align with manufacturer’s guidelines.
C. Setup:
• Load serum specimen(s), calibrators, and QC materials onto the
immunoassay analyzer.
• Program the analyzer following the specific Glycyphagus
domesticus IgE assay protocol.
D. Analysis:
• Start the assay run on the analyzer.
• Monitor for any alerts or errors during the run.
E. Interpretation of Results:
• Review the output from the immunoassay analyzer for each
specimen.
• Ensure the results for Glycyphagus domesticus IgE fall within the
assay’s validated range.
• Check QC results to ensure assay validity.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
Reporting:
• Results should be reviewed and verified by designated laboratory
personnel prior to reporting.
• Enter results into Laboratory Information System (LIS) as per site-
specific reporting guidelines.
• Provide results as follows: -- Normal Reference Range: <0.35 kU/
L (IgE category I or Class 0 - no detectable allergen-specific IgE)
-- Elevated levels/Classes 1-6 depending on the assay specifics
indicating sensitization to Glycyphagus domesticus
Critical Results:
• Report any critical results to the ordering physician promptly with
appropriate documentation.
• Critical IgE levels may indicate a heightened allergic reaction;
follow lab-specific procedures for urgent notification.
1. QUALITY ASSURANCE
Quality Control:
• Follow internal QC protocols as outlined by the analyzer and
reagent manufacturer.
• Analyze QC results with each batch to ensure the accuracy and
precision of the assay.
Proficiency Testing:
• Participate in external proficiency testing programs periodically to
validate assay performance.
Document Control:
• Maintain complete records of specimen processing, QC data,
calibration results, and any corrective actions taken in case of
discrepancies.
1. LIMITATIONS AND METHOD PERFORMANCE
Limitations:
• Substantial hemolysis or lipemia may impact the accuracy of
results.
• Proper specimen handling is crucial to maintain the stability of IgE
antibodies.
Method Performance:
• Refer to the manufacturer's insert for specific performance
characteristics of the Glycyphagus domesticus IgE assay (e.g.,
sensitivity, specificity).
