Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Glypican-3
Immunostain, Technical Component Only
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to provide detailed instructions for
the technical processing and staining of tissue specimens for
Glypican-3 (GPC3) immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis.
RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of qualified laboratory personnel to adhere to
this protocol for accurate and reproducible results. Any deviations or
issues encountered during the procedure must be documented and
reported to the designated supervisor.
1. DEFINITION
Glypican-3 is a heparan sulfate proteoglycan that is often
overexpressed in hepatocellular carcinoma and some other tumors,
making it useful as a diagnostic marker in tumor pathology.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue
blocks or slides.
Specimen Handling: All specimens need to be properly labeled and
documented upon receipt. Store at room temperature until
processing.
1. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• Primary antibody: Glypican-3 antibody, ready-to-use or diluted
based on manufacturer's recommendations.
• Detection system: Linking reagent and enzyme-conjugated
polymer.
• Chromogen: Diaminobenzidine (DAB) or an alternative suitable
chromogen.
• Counterstain: Hematoxylin
• Positive and negative control slides
• Buffer solutions: Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and other
appropriate buffers.
• Mounting medium
1. EQUIPMENT
• Microtome
• Water bath at 37-40°C
• Staining racks and containers
• Heat retrieval system (pressure cooker or microwave oven)
• Automatic tissue stainer (optional)
• Light microscope
1. PROCEDURE
Preparation of Tissue Slides:
1. Cut 3-4 µm thick sections from FFPE tissue blocks using a
microtome.
2. Float the sections on a 37-40°C water bath and collect them
onto charged slides.
3. Allow slides to air dry at room temperature and then dry
completely in a 60°C oven for at least 30 minutes.
Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
1. Deparaffinize slides by placing in three changes of xylene for 5
minutes each.
2. Rehydrate slides through graded alcohol series:
◦ 100% ethanol for 5 minutes (2 changes)
◦ 95% ethanol for 5 minutes
◦ 80% ethanol for 5 minutes
◦ Rinse in distilled water for 5 minutes
Antigen Retrieval:
1. Perform heat-induced epitope retrieval by placing slides in a
suitable retrieval solution (e.g., citrate buffer, pH 6.0) and
heating for 20 minutes in a pressure cooker or microwave.
2. Allow slides to cool for 20 minutes at room temperature and
rinse in PBS.
Staining Procedure:
1. Outline the tissue section with a hydrophobic barrier pen.
2. Apply the primary antibody (Glypican-3) to the sections and
incubate for the time recommended by the manufacturer,
generally 30-60 minutes at room temperature.
3. Rinse slides in PBS buffer for 5 minutes.
4. Apply the linking reagent and incubate according to the
manufacturer’s instructions (generally 10-20 minutes).
5. Rinse slides in PBS buffer for 5 minutes.
6. Apply the enzyme-conjugated polymer and incubate as per the
manufacturer's instructions.
7. Rinse slides in PBS buffer for 5 minutes.
8. Apply the chromogen (DAB) and incubate until the desired stain
intensity is achieved (generally 5-10 minutes).
9. Rinse slides in distilled water.
10. Counterstain with hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes.
11. Rinse slides in distilled water, followed by a dip in 0.1% sodium
bicarbonate to blue the hematoxylin.
12. Dehydrate through graded alcohols and clear in xylene.
Mounting:
1. Apply mounting medium and coverslip.
2. Allow slides to dry and cure before microscopic evaluation.
3. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run a positive control slide to ensure the primary antibody is
staining correctly.
• Run a negative control slide, omitting the primary antibody, to
check for non-specific staining.
• Document and review QC results; any deviations must be
corrected before reporting patient results.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results are interpreted by a pathologist and documented in the
Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Technical completion (staining adequacy) is noted, and any
issues or deviations from the expected results are recorded.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
The interpretation of Glypican-3 staining results is qualitative and is
done by a pathologist. Typically, results are categorized as Positive or
Negative.
1. LIMITATIONS
• Proper fixation is critical — underfixation or overfixation can result
in poor staining.
• Non-specific staining may occur; proper controls must be
reviewed in each run.
• Tissues that are highly pigmented or contain significant necrosis
may present challenges in interpretation.
