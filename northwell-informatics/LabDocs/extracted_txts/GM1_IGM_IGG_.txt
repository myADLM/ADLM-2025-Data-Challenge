Protocol for Analytical Phase of Generating Results for GM1
(IgM & IgG)
1. PURPOSE
To ensure accurate and reliable testing for GM1 antibodies (IgM &
IgG) in patient samples, utilizing standard laboratory procedures and
protocols. This procedure outlines the steps to perform the GM1
antibody assay and includes quality control measures to maintain the
integrity of the results.
2. SCOPE
This protocol is applicable to all laboratory personnel trained in GM1
antibody testing using Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay
(ELISA) or any other validated method.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Laboratory Technologists: Responsible for performing the assay,
documenting results, and ensuring quality control measures are
adhered to.
• Laboratory Supervisor: Responsible for overseeing the process,
addressing any issues that arise during testing, and verifying
results prior to reporting.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/Acceptable Specimen:
• Serum: 5 mL of whole blood collected in a serum separator tube
(SST). Allow the blood to clot for 30 minutes and then centrifuge
for 15 minutes at 1000 x g to separate the serum.
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Hemolyzed or lipemic samples.
• Specimens that have been improperly labeled or stored.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• ELISA kit for GM1 IgM and IgG antibodies.
• Microplate reader capable of measuring absorbance at 450 nm.
• Pipettes and pipette tips.
• Test tubes.
• Vortex mixer.
• Timer.
6. PROCEDURE
1. Preparation:
◦ Allow all reagents and samples to reach room temperature
(20-25°C) before starting the assay.
◦ Prepare the required reagents as per the ELISA kit
instructions.
2. Sample and Reagent Setup:
◦ Pipette 100 μL of each patient serum sample, calibrator, and
control into the appropriate wells of the microplate.
◦ Add 100 μL of the enzyme conjugate to each well.
◦ Incubate the microplate for 30 minutes at room temperature.
3. Washing:
◦ Wash the wells five times with the wash buffer provided in
the kit to remove unbound material.
◦ Tap the plate on absorbent paper to ensure complete
removal of residual liquid.
4. Substrate Reaction:
◦ Add 100 μL of the TMB substrate solution to each well.
◦ Incubate the plate in the dark for 20 minutes at room
temperature.
5. Stopping the Reaction:
◦ Add 50 μL of stop solution to each well to halt the enzyme-
substrate reaction.
6. Reading the Results:
◦ Measure the absorbance of each well at 450 nm using a
microplate reader within 10 minutes of adding the stop
solution.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run high, low, and negative control samples with each batch of
patient samples to ensure assay validity.
• Monitor and document the performance of the assay using control
charts.
• If control results are out of the acceptable range, invalidate the
runs and repeat the assay.
8. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
• Compare the absorbance of patient samples to the calibrator
absorbance to determine the concentration of GM1 IgM and IgG
antibodies.
• Positive results should indicate elevated levels of GM1 antibodies,
while negative results indicate no significant presence of these
antibodies.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
• Accurately transcribe results from the microplate reader to the
Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Review and verify results to ensure they are consistent with
quality control criteria.
• Document any instances of sample rejection or result
discrepancies for further investigation.
10. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Reference ranges for GM1 IgM and IgG antibodies should be
established based on the kit manufacturer's recommendations or
validated in-house by the laboratory for the specific patient
population.
11. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to the ELISA kit insert for limitations related to test
sensitivity, specificity, and potential cross-reactivity.
• Analyze any discordant results (e.g., clinical suspicion versus
laboratory findings) with appropriate repeat testing or additional
confirmatory tests.
12. REFERENCES

techniques.
13. REVISION HISTORY
• Document any updates or changes to the procedure with effective
dates and rationale for revisions.
By following this protocol, laboratory personnel can ensure the
reliable generation of GM1 (IgM & IgG) antibody results, maintaining
the quality and accuracy required for effective patient diagnosis and
management.
