Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
GM2 Antibody Testing
1. PURPOSE
This procedure defines the analytical steps required to generate and
report results for GM2 antibody testing in a Clinical Laboratory
Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-certified laboratory setting. This
protocol ensures consistent and accurate detection and quantitation
of GM2 antibodies in patient specimens.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
Laboratory personnel trained and qualified on the GM2 antibody
testing procedure are responsible for the implementation of this SOP.
The laboratory supervisor is responsible for ensuring that the testing
and quality control methods are followed correctly and documented.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
1. Specimen Type: Serum is the preferred specimen type for GM2
antibody testing.
2. Collection Instructions:
◦ Collect blood specimen using a standard venipuncture
technique.
◦ Serum should be separated from the clot as soon as
possible and within 2 hours of collection.
3. Storage and Stability:
◦ Specimens should be stored at 2-8°C if not tested within 24
hours.
◦ For long-term storage, freeze serum specimens at -20°C or
colder.
◦ Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• GM2 antibody ELISA kit or equivalent validated method.
• Microplate reader compatible with the chosen assay.
• Calibrated precision pipettes and tips.
• Vortex mixer.
• Microplate washer.
• Automated ELISA processor (if available).
• Refrigerated centrifuge.
• Personal protective equipment (PPE).
5. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation
1. Before starting the assay, ensure all reagents and controls are
brought to room temperature (20-26°C).
2. Review the manufacturer’s insert for kit-specific instructions and
expiry dates.
3. Prepare all necessary reagents according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
4. Validate the microplate reader and other instrumentation used
in the assay.
B) Assay Protocol
1. Sample Dilution (if required):
◦ Dilute patient serum samples according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Assay Setup:
◦ Label the microplate wells for standards, controls, and
patient samples.
◦ Add the specified volume of standards, controls, and diluted
patient samples into the appropriate wells.
◦ Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for adding conjugate
and other reagents.
3. Incubation:
◦ Incubate the microplate according to the specific time and
temperature outlined in the kit insert.
4. Washing:
◦ Wash the microplate wells according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Ensure complete removal of wash solution after
each washing cycle.
5. Substrate Addition:
◦ Add the appropriate substrate solution to each well.
◦ Incubate the plate in the dark for the required period
specified in the kit.
6. Stop Reaction:
◦ Add the stop solution to each well to terminate the reaction.
7. Reading Results:
◦ Read the absorbance of each well using a microplate reader
at the wavelength specified in the kit instructions.
◦ Record the absorbance values for standards, controls, and
patient samples.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run internal controls (provided in the kit or laboratory-standard
controls) with each assay to ensure the validity of results.
• Review control results to ensure they fall within the acceptable
range. If controls are out of range, do not report patient results
and troubleshoot the assay.
• Document all controls, lot numbers of kits, and any deviations
from the procedure.
7. CALCULATION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS
1. Data Analysis:
◦ Plot the standard curve using the absorbance values of the
standards.
◦ Calculate the concentration of GM2 antibodies in patient
samples using the standard curve.
2. Result Validation:
◦ Validate results by cross-checking with quality control
ranges.
◦ Ensure that all patient results are accompanied by
appropriate reference intervals and interpretation.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Report results according to laboratory-specific guidelines.
• Include any comments on sample integrity or deviations observed
during the testing process.
• If any critical values or significant findings, notify the appropriate
healthcare provider promptly.

10. DOCUMENTATION
• Record all steps performed, including specimen tracing, quality
control logs, and instrument maintenance.
• Ensure that records are stored securely and are accessible for
audits and reviews.
11. TRAINING
• All personnel performing the GM2 antibody testing must be
trained and competent in this SOP.
