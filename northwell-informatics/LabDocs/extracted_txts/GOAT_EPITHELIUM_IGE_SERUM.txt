Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Generating Results for
Goat Epithelium, IgE, Serum
1. PURPOSE To outline the procedure for the analytical phase of
generating results for Goat Epithelium, IgE, serum test to
ensure accurate results are reported in a timely manner.
RESPONSIBILITY:
• It is the responsibility of all trained technologists to follow this SOP
when performing the Goat Epithelium, IgE serum test.
• It is the responsibility of supervising technologists to ensure
compliance with this SOP and to address any issues or
discrepancies that may arise.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS NOTE: Specimen has already
been collected, received, and accessioned.
• Preferred Specimen: Serum
• Volume: Minimum of 1 mL serum
• Storage: Store samples at 2-8°C if the analysis is to be performed
within 48 hours. For long-term storage, freeze at -20°C or colder.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Immunoassay Analyzer (e.g., Phadia ImmunoCAP system or
equivalent)
• Goat Epithelium, IgE specific assay reagents
• Calibrators and controls specific for IgE quantification
• Micropipettes and disposable tips
• Centrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Laboratory timer
• Reagents for manual steps (if applicable)
• Serum separator tubes (SST)
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
1. PROCEDURE
4.1 PREPARATION
1. Ensure that all reagents are within their expiry dates and stored
according to manufacturer guidelines.
2. Calibrate the immunoassay analyzer as per the manufacturer's
instructions using calibrators specific to the Goat Epithelium,
IgE assay.
3. Equilibrate reagents and samples to room temperature before
use.
4.2 SAMPLE PREPARATION
1. Centrifuge the serum samples at 1500-2000 x g for 10 minutes.
2. Transfer the clear serum to appropriately labeled tubes,
avoiding any cellular debris.
4.3 ASSAY PROCEDURE
1. Load the serum samples, calibrators, and quality control
samples into the immunoassay analyzer.
2. Follow the instrument-specific protocol for the Goat Epithelium,
IgE assay. This typically includes the following steps: a. Sample
addition: Pipette the required volume of serum into the
designated wells or tubes. b. Incubation: Allow the samples to
incubate with specific Goat Epithelium antigens for the time and
temperature recommended by the assay protocol. c. Washing:
Wash the samples to remove unbound components. d.
Detection: Add detection antibodies (e.g., enzyme-labeled anti-
IgE) and incubate for the specified time. e. Substrate addition:
Add the enzyme substrate to develop the colorimetric or
chemiluminescent signal. f. Detection: Measure the signal using
the appropriate detection wavelength on the immunoassay
analyzer.
4.4 QUALITY CONTROL
1. Run quality control samples (both positive and negative
controls) alongside patient samples.
2. Accept the run if the control values are within the specified
range.
3. If controls are outside the acceptable range, troubleshoot
according to the manufacturer’s guidelines and repeat the
assay if necessary.
4. RESULT REPORTING
5. Analyze and interpret the results using the immunoassay
analyzer's software.
6. Ensure that the results are within the reportable range. For
values out of range, follow the analyzer's protocol for dilution
and re-testing.
7. Review and verify results in accordance with laboratory
protocol.
8. Report the results through the Laboratory Information System
(LIS), ensuring all required fields and any necessary comments
are completed.
9. LIMITATIONS
• The test is specific for IgE antibodies to Goat Epithelium and may
not detect all allergen-specific IgE.
• Hemolysis, lipemia, or microbial contamination may affect the test
results.
• Refer to the assay kit insert for additional limitations related to the
specific method.
