Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Generating Results for
GOAT'S MILK, IGE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedures involved in the analytical phase of testing
GOAT'S MILK, IGE, SERUM to ensure accurate and reliable
laboratory results.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of the trained laboratory personnel to follow the
procedures outlined in this SOP, ensuring all steps are performed in
accordance with the laboratory’s quality standards and compliance
requirements.
1. SCOPE
This SOP covers the steps involved from the preparation of reagents
and controls, processing of patient specimens, to the analysis and
reporting of results for GOAT'S MILK, IGE, SERUM.
1. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
• Calibrated Immunoanalyzer
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes and disposable tips
• Serum collection tubes
• Control and Calibration reagents for IGE
• Goat’s Milk-specific IgE test kits
• Appropriate PPE (gloves, lab coat, etc.)
1. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation:
1. Reagent and Control Preparation:
◦ Inspect expiration dates and lot numbers of all reagents and
controls.
◦ Allow reagents and controls to reach room temperature
before use, if recommended by the manufacturer.
2. Calibration:
◦ Perform calibration of equipment using calibration kits
specific for IgE according to manufacturer’s guidelines.
◦ Document calibration in the calibration log.
3. Control Run:
◦ Run quality control samples at the beginning of each batch,
after every calibration, and at the end of the batch.
◦ Acceptable ranges for controls must be established before
analyzing patient samples.
◦ Document control run results.
B) Specimen Processing:
1. Specimen Acceptability:
◦ Verify all serum samples are properly labeled and stored at
2-8°C if analysis is not immediately performed.
◦ Centrifuge serum collection tubes at 3000 RPM for 10
minutes to separate serum from clot.
◦ Inspect serum visually for hemolysis or lipemia, specimens
exhibiting visible hemolysis or gross lipemia should be
rejected.
2. Specimen Preparation:
◦ Aliquot the required volume of serum (as per test kit
instructions) into the sample well or tube designated for
analysis.
C) Analysis:
1. Automated Analysis:
◦ Load the prepared specimens, quality controls, and
reagents onto the immunoanalyzer according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Select the specific assay for GOAT'S MILK, IGE, SERUM.
◦ Start the assay run according to the immunoanalyzer’s
operational manual.
2. Manual Analysis (if applicable):
◦ Using a pipette, dispense the specific volumes of reagents,
controls, and patient serum as per the test kit instructions
into designated wells of the microtiter plate.
◦ Incubate, wash, and signal generation steps should be
followed exactly per the test kit instructions.
◦ Read and record the absorbance values using a microplate
reader.
D) Result Interpretation and Reporting:
1. Evaluation:
◦ Ensure all quality control results are within the defined
acceptable ranges.
◦ Interpret patient results based upon standard calibration
curves or direct values given by the immunoanalyzer.
◦ If any control fails, do not report patient results and
troubleshoot the issue, repeating the control and sample
analysis as necessary.
2. Documentation:
◦ Record all results in the laboratory’s LIS (Laboratory
Information System).
◦ Confirm that p-values or concentration levels for GOAT'S
MILK, IGE, SERUM are correctly entered.
3. Verification:
◦ Results must be reviewed and verified by a qualified
technologist before release.
◦ Any critical results (significantly high levels) must be brought
to the attention of a supervisor and follow the laboratory’s
protocol for critical value reporting.
E) Reporting Results:
• Ensure results are properly documented, indicating any
anomalies or comments based on quality control observations.
• Follow site-specific guidelines for reporting results into the LIS
and notifying the ordering physician of results.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
Internal Controls:
Perform internal quality control analysis using known positive and
negative controls provided in the test kit every batch.
External Controls:
Participate in an external proficiency testing program for IgE to
ensure analytical accuracy.
