Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for GOLDENROD, IgE, Serum
1. PURPOSE This procedure outlines the steps required to
analyze IgE levels in serum specimens using the designated
equipment and reagents. The aim is to ensure accurate and
reproducible results that uphold clinical diagnostic standards.
Responsibility: All designated staff members are responsible for
following this procedure to analyze IgE levels in serum specimens
accurately. Staff members must ensure proper documentation and
troubleshooting as needed.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS Acceptable Specimen:
• 5 mL serum collected in a red-top tube or serum separator tube
(SST) for optimal results.
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Specimens collected in anticoagulant tubes (e.g., EDTA, heparin).
• Samples with signs of hemolysis or contamination.
• Specimens without proper labeling of date/time of collection.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• IgE assay kit (manufacturer specific)
• Serum separator tube (SST)
• Refrigerated centrifuge
• Analyzer compatible with the IgE assay kit
• Reagent grade water
• Precision pipettes and tips
• Quality control materials (low, medium, high IgE controls)
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
1. PROCEDURE A. Preparation:
2. Check the expiration date and integrity of the IgE assay kit.
3. Verify that the reagents are stored appropriately according to
manufacturer guidelines.
4. Perform daily maintenance of the analyzer and ensure it is
calibrated.
B. Sample Processing:
1. Centrifuge the serum separator tube at 1500 x g for 10 minutes
to separate serum from cells.
2. Transfer the clear serum to a labeled sample tube.
3. Ensure samples are free from hemolysis or contamination
before proceeding.
C. Assay Setup:
1. Load the serum samples into the analyzer following
manufacturer instructions for the IgE assay kit.
2. Include quality control samples (low, medium, high) for each
assay run.
3. Program the analyzer with the appropriate assay parameters
based on the kit instructions.
D. Analysis:
1. Initiate the analysis process on the analyzer. Monitor and
document the progress.
2. Ensure that the process aligns with manufacturer specifications
for temperature, incubation time, and readout.
3. QUALITY CONTROL A. Frequency:
• Perform quality control checks with each assay run using certified
control materials.
• Document the results on the Quality Control Log.
B. Acceptance Criteria:
• The control values must fall within the specified range provided by
the control manufacturer's documentation.
• Any deviation from the acceptable range necessitates
troubleshooting, re-analysis, and if unresolved, notification to the
supervisor.
1. RESULT GENERATION AND REPORTING A. Review and
Verification:
2. Assess the output data from the analyzer for any flags or error
codes.
3. Perform a visual check of the sample chromatograms, if
applicable.
4. Verify the results manually or through the laboratory information
system (LIS).
B. Documentation:
1. Document all sample results, QC outcomes, and any corrective
actions taken in the appropriate logbooks.
2. Report results in the LIS and ensure they are reviewed and
authorized by designated personnel.
3. TROUBLESHOOTING AND CORRECTIVE ACTIONS A.
Trouble Detection:
• If quality control fails, perform a re-analysis.
• If analyzer flags a sample, check for issues such as volume
discrepancies, hemolysis, or contamination.
B. Steps to Correct:
1. Re-calibrate the analyzer if necessary.
2. Prepare fresh reagents if degradation is suspected.
3. Request a new sample collection from the patient if the sample
integrity is compromised.
