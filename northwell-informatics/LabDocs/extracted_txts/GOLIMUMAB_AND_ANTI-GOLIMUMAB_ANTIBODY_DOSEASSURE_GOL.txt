Standard Operating Procedure for the Analytical Phase
of Generating Results for GOLIMUMAB AND ANTI-
GOLIMUMAB ANTIBODY, DOSEASSURE GOL
1. PURPOSE
This procedure outlines the steps required to accurately analyze and
generate results for Golimumab and Anti-Golimumab Antibody using
the DoseASSURE Gol method. This ensures consistent, reliable, and
reproducible test results, which are crucial for patient care and
treatment decisions.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of designated laboratory personnel to perform
the analysis as outlined in this SOP. This includes, but is not limited
to, ensuring that all equipment is properly calibrated, reagents are
prepared and used correctly, and all quality control measures are
adhered to.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Equipment:
◦ Microplate Reader capable of measuring absorbance at 450
nm
◦ Microplate Washer
◦ Incubator set to 37°C
◦ Pipettes (single and multi-channel)
◦ Centrifuge capable of 2000 x g
• Reagents:
◦ DoseASSURE Golimumab ELISA Kit
◦ Anti-Golimumab ELISA Kit
◦ Calibrators and Controls provided in the kits
• Supplies:
◦ Microplates
◦ Pipette tips
◦ Reagent reservoirs
◦ Deionized water
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Type: Serum or plasma (EDTA or Heparin)
• Volume: 500 μL
• Stability: Specimens should be stored at 2-8°C if analyzed within
24 hours. If analysis is delayed, specimens should be stored at
-20°C or below.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation:
1. Reagent Preparation:
◦ Bring all reagents and specimens to room temperature
(20-25°C) before use.
◦ Prepare wash buffer by diluting the 20X concentrate with
deionized water (if required by kit instructions).
◦ Reconstitute controls and calibrators according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
2. Specimen Preparation:
◦ Centrifuge specimens at 2000 x g for 10 minutes to remove
particulates.
◦ Aliquot and label samples appropriately.
B. Golimumab Analysis:
1. Assay Procedure:
◦ Add 100 μL of calibrators, controls, and specimens to the
appropriate wells of the microplate.
◦ Incubate the plate for 60 minutes at 37°C.
◦ Wash the plate 3 times with 300 μL of wash buffer.
◦ Add 100 μL of conjugate to each well.
◦ Incubate the plate for 60 minutes at 37°C.
◦ Wash the plate 3 times with 300 μL of wash buffer.
◦ Add 100 μL of substrate solution to each well.
◦ Incubate the plate for 15 minutes at room temperature,
protected from light.
◦ Add 100 μL of stop solution to each well.
◦ Read the plate at 450 nm using a microplate reader.
2. Calculation of Results:
◦ Create a standard curve by plotting the absorbance values
of the calibrators against their concentrations.
◦ Determine the concentration of Golimumab in the
specimens by interpolating their absorbance values on the
standard curve.
C. Anti-Golimumab Antibody Analysis:
1. Assay Procedure:
◦ Add 100 μL of calibrators, controls, and specimens to the
appropriate wells of the microplate.
◦ Incubate the plate for 60 minutes at 37°C.
◦ Wash the plate 3 times with 300 μL of wash buffer.
◦ Add 100 μL of conjugate to each well.
◦ Incubate the plate for 60 minutes at 37°C.
◦ Wash the plate 3 times with 300 μL of wash buffer.
◦ Add 100 μL of substrate solution to each well.
◦ Incubate the plate for 15 minutes at room temperature,
protected from light.
◦ Add 100 μL of stop solution to each well.
◦ Read the plate at 450 nm using a microplate reader.
2. Calculation of Results:
◦ Create a standard curve by plotting the absorbance values
of the calibrators against their concentrations.
◦ Determine the concentration of Anti-Golimumab Antibody in
the specimens by interpolating their absorbance values on
the standard curve.
3. QUALITY CONTROL
• Material: Use internal quality control samples and external
proficiency testing materials as applicable.
• Procedure:
◦ Perform quality control at the start of each run and after any
significant maintenance or troubleshooting.
◦ Control results must fall within the established acceptable
range before patient results are released.
◦ Document all quality control data.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Ensure that results are reviewed and verified by a qualified
technologist.
• Flag any critical or out-of-range results and follow the laboratory's
protocol for reporting and documenting these results.
