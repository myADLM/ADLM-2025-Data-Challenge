Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase of Generating Results for Gonadotropin-
Releasing Hormone (GnRH, Luteinizing Hormone-Releasing
Hormone LHRH)
1. PURPOSE:
To establish a standardized procedure for the analysis and
generation of results for Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone (GnRH,
also known as Luteinizing Hormone-Releasing Hormone LHRH) in
clinical specimens, ensuring accurate, reliable, and timely test
results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY:
The trained laboratory staff is responsible for performing the
analytical procedures as described in this SOP. It is the responsibility
of the laboratory supervisor to ensure that all personnel performing
this procedure are adequately trained and competent.
3. DEFINITIONS:
GnRH (LHRH): A hormone responsible for the release of follicle-
stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) from the
anterior pituitary gland.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY:
Preferred Specimen:
• Serum: Collect blood in serum separator tubes (SST). Allow
clotting for 30 minutes and promptly centrifuge at 1500 x g for 10
minutes to separate the serum. Transfer serum into a labeled
aliquot container.
Acceptable Specimens:
• Plasma: Collect in EDTA or heparin tubes. Thoroughly mix to
ensure anticoagulation and promptly centrifuge at 1500 x g for 10
minutes. Transfer plasma into labeled aliquot containers.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric specimens due to their impact on
the assay's accuracy.
• Clotted blood in anticoagulant tubes.
Specimen Stability:
• Store at 2-8°C if analysis will occur within 48 hours.
• For longer storage, freeze at -20°C or colder. Avoid repeated
freeze-thaw cycles.
5. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES:
• GnRH (LHRH) Test Kit (Fitzgerald, Cat. No.: 55R-2389)
• Calibrators and Control materials as specified by the
manufacturer
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Centrifuge
• Automated Immunoassay Analyzer
• Vortex mixer
• Laboratory timer
6. EQUIPMENT SETTING AND PREPARATION:
• Ensure that all equipment used in the analytical process is
calibrated and maintained as per the manufacturer's instructions.
• Confirm that the automated immunoassay analyzer is operating
correctly and relevant reagents are loaded.
7. PROCEDURE:
7.1 Preparation:
• Verify specimen integrity and appropriateness (confirm any
critically hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric specimens are discarded or
rejected).
• Bring all reagents, samples, and controls to room temperature
prior to use.
7.2 Reagent Preparation:
• Prepare reagents according to the manufacturer's instructions.
• Reconstitute lyophilized reagents, if necessary, and label with the
preparation date.
7.3 Calibration and QC:
• Run calibrators and control materials prior to performing the
measurements to ensure the instrument is properly calibrated.
• Document all calibration and QC runs as per your laboratory’s
documentation policies.
7.4 Sample Analysis:
• Load the prepared samples onto the automated immunoassay
analyzer.
• Select the GnRH/LHRH assay from the analyzer’s menu and
ensure proper sample identification.
• Start the run and monitor it to ensure it is proceeding correctly.
7.5 Result Validation:
• Once the samples have been analyzed, retrieve and review the
data.
• Validate the results by ensuring the controls are within the
expected range. If controls fail, troubleshoot the issue per
manufacturer’s guidelines, recalibrate if necessary, and re-run
affected samples.
• Verify that all samples are processed, and any technical issues
encountered are documented and addressed appropriately.
8. REPORTING RESULTS:
• Transfer results to the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
following data verification.
• Review results for accuracy and completeness before final
approval.
• Communicate critical results directly to the ordering physician or
medical staff as per laboratory protocols.
9. QUALITY CONTROL:
• Perform internal quality control analyses per the laboratory's QC
schedule.
• Document all QC findings and take immediate corrective action
for any out-of-range QC results.
• Conduct periodic proficiency testing as required by regulatory
standards.
