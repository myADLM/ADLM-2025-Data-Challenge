Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical
Phase of Generating Results for GOOSE FEATHERS,
IGE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the accurate and reliable
measurement of serum IgE specific to goose feathers. This SOP
ensures consistency in the analytical process, thereby ensuring the
reliability and accuracy of the results.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to the analytical phase of serum IgE testing specific
to goose feathers using the appropriate immunoassay, following
specimen accessioning and prior to result verification and reporting.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Laboratory Technologists: Perform and document all steps in
the analytical process as outlined in this SOP.
• Supervisors/Managers: Ensure adherence to this SOP and
oversee the transportation and handling of specimens and
reagents.
• Quality Control Personnel: Monitor and maintain the quality
control of reagents and instruments.
4. PROCEDURE
4.1 Equipment and Materials
• Immunoassay analyzer (capable of detecting IgE levels)
• Goose feathers-specific IgE reagent kits
• Calibrators and controls
• Micropipettes and tips
• Centrifuge (for sample preparation, if required)
• Laboratory timer
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
4.2 Reagents and Supplies
• Control and calibrator solutions specific for IgE
• Serum samples (minimum volume as specified by manufacturer)
• Appropriate waste disposal receptacles
4.3 Quality Control
• Perform daily quality control checks using control samples at
different levels (low, medium, high) before running patient
samples.
• Document all quality control results and ensure they fall within
acceptable range prior to proceeding with patient samples.
• Follow the manufacturer’s guidelines for calibration frequency and
use of calibrators.
4.4 Sample Preparation
1. Confirm that serum samples are free from hemolysis, lipemia,
or icterus, as they may interfere with test results.
2. Allow samples to come to room temperature before analysis.
Do not use samples that have been frozen more than three
times.
3. Mix samples thoroughly by gentle inversion.
4.5 Analytical Procedure
1. Loading Samples:
◦ Open the immunoassay analyzer and follow manufacturer
instructions to load reagents, controls, calibrators, and
samples.
◦ Ensure barcodes (if applicable) on samples are properly
scanned for accurate identification.
2. Running the Assay:
◦ Select the test method for goose feathers IgE on the
analyzer.
◦ Load samples in the designated positions as per instrument
guidelines.
◦ Initiate the test run according to the instrument's protocol.
3. Monitoring Run:
◦ Monitor the system for any error messages or alerts.
◦ Ensure the instrument calibration is valid throughout the run.
4. Post-Run Procedures:
◦ Upon completion, verify that all controls and calibrators are
within acceptable ranges.
◦ Analyze data generated by the immunoassay analyzer.
4.6 Result Interpretation
• The results should be interpreted according to the reference
ranges provided with the reagent kit.
• Results out of range should be handled as per laboratory policies,
including repeating the test if necessary.
4.7 Result Verification and Reporting
1. Verification:
◦ Cross-check the results with control values.
◦ Verify result accuracy with another technologist if needed.
2. Reporting:
◦ Enter the verified results into the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
◦ Ensure proper documentation of any discrepancies or notes.
4.8 Maintenance and Troubleshooting
• Follow manufacturer's guidelines for routine maintenance of the
immunoassay analyzer.
• Troubleshoot any issues as per the instrument’s user manual.
• Record any maintenance or troubleshooting performed in the
laboratory maintenance log.
