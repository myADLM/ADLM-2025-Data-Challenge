STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP) FOR GP210
ANTIBODY, IGG, SERUM ANALYSIS
1. PURPOSE To outline the standardized analytical procedures for
the measurement of GP210 Antibody, IgG, Serum in a CLIA-certified
laboratory to ensure accurate and reliable test results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY It's the responsibility of trained laboratory
personnel to follow this SOP accurately to maintain test integrity, and
to record all relevant data and observations.
3. DEFINITIONS GP210 Antibody, IgG, Serum: These are antibodies
targeting the GP210 autoantigen, used as a marker for certain
autoimmune liver diseases.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS Specimen Type: Serum Volume
Required: Minimum 1 mL serum Specimen Collection: Venous blood
should be collected in a serum-separating tube (SST) and allowed to
clot at room temperature for 30 minutes before centrifugation.
Sample should be centrifuged at 1100-1300 g for 10-15 minutes.
Specimen Storage: 2-8°C if analyzed within 48 hours; otherwise,
store frozen at -20°C.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed samples
• Samples with microbial contamination
• Samples thawed and refrozen multiple times
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES Equipment:
• ELISA Reader
• Centrifuge
• Micropipettes and tips
• Incubator (37°C)
Reagents:
• GP210 Autoantibody IgG test kit (supplier information, catalog
number)
• Calibrators
• Quality Control (QC) samples
• Wash Buffer
• Substrate Solution
• Stop Solution
6. PROCEDURE 6.1. Preparation
1. Reagent Preparation: Prepare all reagents, standards,
calibrators, and controls as per the manufacturer’s instructions
provided with the GP210 Autoantibody IgG test kit.
2. Plate Setup: Design the layout for the microtiter plate to include
standards, patient samples, and QC samples in duplicates.
6.2. Assay Procedure
1. Pipetting Samples:
◦ Add 100 µL of calibrators, controls, and patient samples to
the respective wells.
2. Incubation:
◦ Incubate the plate at 37°C for 60 minutes.
3. Washing:
◦ Wash the wells 5 times with 300 µL of washing buffer to
remove unbound components.
4. Secondary Antibody Addition:
◦ Add 100 µL of enzyme-labelled secondary antibody to each
well.
5. Incubation:
◦ Incubate the plate at 37°C for 30 minutes.
6. Second Washing:
◦ Wash the wells again 5 times with 300 µL of washing buffer.
7. Substrate Addition:
◦ Add 100 µL of substrate solution to each well. Incubate in
the dark at room temperature for 15 minutes.
8. Stop Reaction:
◦ Add 100 µL of stop solution to each well to terminate the
reaction.
6.3. Measurement
• Read the absorbance of each well at 450 nm, with a reference
wavelength of 620 nm using an ELISA reader.
6.4. Calculation of Results
1. Generate a standard curve by plotting the absorbance of
standards against their concentrations.
2. Calculate the concentration of GP210 Antibody, IgG in patient
samples using the generated standard curve and software
associated with the ELISA reader.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Internal Control: Include negative and positive controls in each
run. The results must be within the acceptance criteria defined
by the manufacturer.
2. External Control: Run proficiency samples periodically, and
compare with interlaboratory results to ensure accuracy.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Transmit results automatically to the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
2. Review and verify the results by the designated technologist.
3. Reference Interval: Reference ranges should be documented
based on the manufacturer’s insert or validated local data.
9. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If controls fall outside the acceptable range, rerun the samples
after identifying and correcting the problem.
• Check for potential issues like improper washing or pipetting
errors that may affect results.
10. MAINTENANCE AND CALIBRATION
• Regularly clean and calibrate the ELISA reader and other
equipment following the maintenance schedule provided by the
manufacturers.
• Use calibrators and record calibration data as specified by the
assay’s insert.
11. REFERENCES
• GP210 Autoantibody IgG test kit manufacturer’s insert.
• Related standard laboratory procedures and guidelines.
12. REVISION HISTORY Document all changes made to the
protocol, with dates and responsible persons for the changes, for
traceability.
By following this standardized protocol, we ensure the accuracy,
reliability, and reproducibility of the GP210 Antibody, IgG, Serum
assay results.
