SOP for Generating Results for GQ1B (IGG)
1. PURPOSE
To ensure consistent, reliable, and accurate results for the GQ1B
(IgG) antibody assay. This document outlines the procedures for the
analysis, quality control, and reporting of GQ1B (IgG) antibody
results.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to the analysis of serum samples for the presence
of GQ1B (IgG) antibodies using the specified ELISA kit or other
approved methods. The procedure assumes that the specimen has
been collected, received, and accessioned correctly.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
Laboratory Technologists are responsible for performing the tests as
outlined in this procedure. Laboratory Supervisors are responsible for
ensuring adherence to this SOP and addressing any deviations or
issues.
4. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• ELISA plate reader
• Pipettes (single-channel and multi-channel)
• ELISA kit for GQ1B (IgG) (Specify brand and catalog number)
• Calibrated traceable thermometer
• Incubator (37°C)
• Microplate washer
• Refrigerator (2-8°C)
• Freezer (-20°C or lower)
• Distilled or deionized water
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STORAGE
• Specimen: Serum
• Acceptable: 5 mL blood collected in a serum separator tube
(SST). Serum should be separated within 2 hours of collection.
• Unacceptable: Hemolyzed, hyperlipemic, or icteric samples.
Samples that have been thawed and refrozen multiple times
should not be used.
• Storage: Serum should be stored at 2-8°C for up to 72 hours. For
longer storage, freeze at -20°C or lower. Avoid repeated freeze-
thaw cycles.
6. PROCEDURE
6.1 Preparation
1. Bring all reagents, samples, and controls to room temperature
(20-25°C) before starting the assay.
2. Ensure that all necessary equipment is clean and functional.
6.2 Assay Procedure
1. Preparation of Reagents and Standards
◦ Prepare standards and controls as per the manufacturer's
instructions.
◦ Label all tubes and wells appropriately.
2. Sample and Control Loading
◦ Pipette the appropriate volume of calibrators, controls, and
patient samples into designated wells of the microplate.
◦ Each patient sample, control, and blank should be tested in
duplicate to ensure accuracy and reliability.
3. Incubation with GQ1B Coated Microplate
◦ Add 100 µL of prepared sample, standards, or controls to
each well.
◦ Cover the plate with adhesive cover foil.
◦ Incubate at 37°C for the time specified in the kit manual,
typically 60 minutes.
4. Washing
◦ Wash the microplate wells using the microplate washer with
the wash buffer provided. Perform as many washes as
directed in the manufacturer's instructions to ensure
complete removal of unbound materials.
5. Secondary Antibody Conjugate Addition
◦ Add 100 µL of secondary antibody conjugate to each well.
◦ Incubate the plate at 37°C for the specified time, typically 30
minutes.
6. Addition of Substrate
◦ Add 100 µL of the substrate solution to each well.
◦ Incubate at room temperature, protected from light, until the
development of a blue color. This typically takes about 10-20
minutes.
7. Stop Reaction
◦ Add 100 µL of stop solution to each well to halt the
enzymatic reaction. The color will change from blue to
yellow.
8. Reading the Plate
◦ Read the absorbance of each well at 450 nm using the
ELISA plate reader within 30 minutes of adding the stop
solution.
6.3 Analytical Interpretation
1. Calculation of Results
◦ Calculate the mean absorbance for each set of duplicate
samples, standards, and controls.
◦ Construct a standard curve by plotting the mean
absorbance values of the standards against their respective
concentrations.
◦ Determine the concentration of GQ1B (IgG) in the patient
samples from the standard curve.
2. Quality Control
◦ Ensure that the results for the controls are within the
acceptance ranges as specified by the manufacturer. If the
controls are outside of the specified range, the run is invalid
and must be repeated.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run positive and negative controls with each batch of tests.
• Document the lot number and expiration date of all reagents
used.
• Review and sign all QC logs before releasing patient results.
• Participate in external quality assessment programs as available.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
1. When interpreting results, follow laboratory-specific criteria for
reference intervals and any necessary follow-up actions.
2. Report all results to the ordering physician or department as per
laboratory guidelines.
3. Retain all documentation associated with the assay for the time
period mandated by CLIA regulations.
9. TROUBLESHOOTING
• Inconsistent or high background signal: Ensure proper washing
steps, check for contamination, and validate the stability of
reagents.
• Low signal: Verify the integrity and storage conditions of the
reagents and specimens. Ensure all equipment is functioning
correctly.
• No signal: Ensure that all steps were followed correctly and
recheck the incubation times and temperatures.
10. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s Instructions from GQ1B (IgG) ELISA Kit
• Relevant CLSI guidelines
• Laboratory-specific equipment manuals and operating procedures
11. DOCUMENTATION
Ensure all procedural steps, observations, and results are
documented in accordance with the laboratory's documentation
policies. This includes maintaining logs for equipment calibration, QC
results, and any troubleshooting efforts.
By adhering to this SOP, consistent and reliable GQ1B (IgG) antibody
results will be ensured, supporting accurate diagnosis and patient
care.
