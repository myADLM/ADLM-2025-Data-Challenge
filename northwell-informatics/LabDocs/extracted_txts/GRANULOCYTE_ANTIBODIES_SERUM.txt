Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for GRANULOCYTE
ANTIBODIES, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedures required for the accurate analysis of
granulocyte antibodies (serum) to ensure the accuracy, precision,
and reliability of test results.
1. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel involved in the
testing and reporting of granulocyte antibodies, serum.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all technologists to ensure that the
procedures are followed strictly. Supervisors are responsible for
ensuring compliance and dealing with any issues or discrepancies.
1. DEFINITIONS
Granulocyte Antibodies: Antibodies directed against granulocyte
antigens that may be involved in various hematologic diseases,
including transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) and
autoimmune neutropenias.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• Microplate Reader (optimized for OD read at 450 nm)
• Centrifuge
• Incubator (set at 37°C for incubation steps)
• Micropipettes (20-200 µL and 100-1000 µL)
• Disposable pipette tips
• Microplates (immunoassay grade)
• Primary and secondary antibodies (as per manufacturer’s
instruction)
• Granulocyte antigen conjugate reagent
• Dilution buffers (PBS or as specified in the protocol)
• Washing buffer
• Substrate solution (e.g., TMB)
• Stop solution (e.g., 1N H2SO4)
• Control sera (Positive and Negative Controls)
• Deionized water
1. PROCEDURE
6.1 Preparation
6.1.1 Ensure all reagents and specimens are at room temperature.
6.1.2 Label microplate wells to avoid cross-contamination. 6.1.3
Prepare all required dilutions of patient sera and controls according
to the manufacturer's instructions.
6.2 Assay Procedure
6.2.1 Sample and Control Preparation:
• Dilute patient serum, positive control and negative control with the
provided sample dilution buffer typically at a dilution ratio of 1:10
(or as per manufacturer’s guidelines).
6.2.2 Plate Preparation:
• Add 100 µL of the diluted samples, positive control, and negative
control to the assigned wells of the microplate.
• Incubate the microplate at 37°C for 1 hour.
6.2.3 Wash Step:
• Wash the microplate wells with washing buffer for 3 cycles,
ensuring each well is filled completely and then aspirated.
6.2.4 Detection Antibody Addition:
• Add 100 µL of detection antibody to each well.
• Incubate the microplate at 37°C for 30 minutes.
6.2.5 Wash Step:
• Wash the microplate wells with washing buffer for 3 cycles.
6.2.6 Substrate Addition:
• Add 100 µL of substrate solution (TMB) to each well.
• Incubate the microplate in the dark at room temperature for 10-15
minutes to develop color.
6.2.7 Stop Reaction:
• Add 50 µL of stop solution to each well to halt the reaction. The
color will change from blue to yellow.
6.2.8 Reading the Plate:
• Read the plate at 450 nm using the microplate reader within 30
minutes of adding the stop solution.
6.3 Result Calculation
6.3.1 Calculate the optical density (OD) values for each well. 6.3.2
Normalize the test sample OD against the average OD of the
negative control wells. 6.3.3 Results interpretation should be as per
the manufacturer’s criteria (e.g., OD ratio > 2.0 may be considered
positive).
1. QUALITY CONTROL
7.1 Run positive and negative controls with each assay to ensure
accuracy and reproducibility. 7.2 Check control results to ensure they
fall within the expected ranges. Do not report patient results if
controls are out of range. Repeat the assay. 7.3 Record control
values in the laboratory QC log.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
8.1 Report the results as "Positive", "Negative", or "Indeterminate"
based on the OD value interpretation criteria. 8.2 If any issues arise
during the test, document thoroughly and notify the supervisor
immediately.
1. REFERENCES
Include specific kit or manufacturer references (e.g., product inserts,
operation manuals). Detailed Assay Kit Manufacturer’s instructions
for handling and procedures.
1. RECORDS
Maintain all records of test runs, controls, and maintenance logs for
equipment used in the procedure. Ensure these logs are complete
and undamaged for potential review and quality assurance audits.
End of SOP
Note: This SOP should be reviewed and approved by the laboratory
director or designated supervisor prior to implementation. Regular
review and updates should be done annually or as new guidelines
and protocols become available.
