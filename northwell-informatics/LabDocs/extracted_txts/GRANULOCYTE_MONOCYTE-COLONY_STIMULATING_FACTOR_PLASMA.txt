Standard Operating Procedure for Analytical Phase of Generating
Results for Granulocyte-Monocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor (GM-
CSF), Plasma
1. PURPOSE This protocol provides a step-by-step procedure for
the accurate and reliable determination of Granulocyte-
Monocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor (GM-CSF) levels in
plasma samples. The goal is to ensure the quality and
consistency of results reported.
Responsibility: It is the responsibility of the trained laboratory
personnel to perform and document the steps involved in the
analytical phase according to these procedures. Any deviations or
issues must be reported to the laboratory supervisor immediately.
1. DEFINITION Granulocyte-Monocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor
(GM-CSF) – a cytokine that functions in the immune response
by stimulating the growth and differentiation of hematopoietic
precursor cells into granulocytes and monocytes.
2. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• ELISA (Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay) kit specific for
GM-CSF
• Microplate reader set to the wavelength specified in the ELISA kit
instructions
• Pipettes and tips (adjustable for different volumes)
• Plate washer or multi-channel pipettor
• Calibration standards for GM-CSF
• Quality control materials (negative control and positive control)
• Refrigerated centrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Timer
• Deionized or distilled water
• Appropriate waste disposal containers
• Laboratory coat, gloves, and safety glasses
1. PROCEDURE A. Preparation
2. Before initiating the assay, ensure all reagents and samples are
equilibrated to room temperature.
3. Set up the equipment required for the procedure. Turn on the
microplate reader and set the wavelength according to the
ELISA kit's instructions.
4. Prepare all required reagents, including wash buffer, substrate
solution, and stop solution, as specified in the ELISA kit insert.
B. Sample and Reagent Preparation
1. Thaw plasma samples at room temperature. Mix thoroughly but
gently.
2. Prepare calibration standards by serially diluting the stock
standard as instructed in the kit insert.
3. Prepare quality control samples in the same matrix (plasma) as
the unknown samples.
C. Assay Procedure
1. Label the required number of microplate wells for standards,
quality controls, and unknown samples.
2. Add the appropriate amount of standards, controls, and plasma
samples into designated wells.
3. Add the detection antibody to each well as specified in the kit
insert.
4. Incubate the plate at the recommended temperature for the
time specified in the kit insert.
5. After incubation, wash the plate using the plate washer or a
multi-channel pipettor with wash buffer. Repeat the washing
steps as recommended.
6. Add the substrate solution to each well. Incubate the plate in
the dark at room temperature for the specified time (usually
15-30 minutes).
7. Add the stop solution to each well to halt the enzymatic
reaction.
D. Reading and Data Analysis
1. Read the plate on the microplate reader at the specified
wavelength shortly after adding the stop solution.
2. Generate a standard curve from the absorbance readings of the
calibration standards and use it to calculate the concentration of
GM-CSF in the unknown samples.
3. Verify that the control samples fall within the expected range for
quality control purposes.
E. Reporting Results
1. Record the concentration of GM-CSF for each plasma sample
in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
2. Review and validate all results before submitting the final
report.
3. Report any critical values or unexpected results to the
supervisor immediately following laboratory policy.
4. QUALITY CONTROL A. Quality Control Material Analysis
5. Run quality control samples in each assay to ensure assay
reliability.
6. Determine that the quality control results meet the established
criteria before reporting patient results.
7. Perform corrective actions if quality control results fall outside of
acceptable ranges.
B. Instrument and Reagent Validation
1. Validate the performance of the microplate reader regularly
based on the manufacturer's instructions.
2. Verify the lot number and expiration dates of all reagents and
calibration standards before use.
3. METHOD LIMITATIONS Refer to the ELISA kit insert for
specific limitations related to the assay's detection range,
interfering substances, and cross-reactivity with other analytes.
