Standard Operating Procedure for GRANZYME B
IMMUNOSTAIN, TECHNICAL COMPONENT ONLY
1. PURPOSE
This protocol provides a standardized procedure for the analytical
phase of generating results for Granzyme B immunostain, focusing
exclusively on the technical component in a CLIA-certified laboratory.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of trained laboratory personnel to perform,
document, and troubleshoot the Granzyme B immunostain according
to this procedure.
3. DEFINITIONS
Granzyme B: Granzyme B is a serine protease that is released by
cytotoxic T cells and natural killer (NK) cells. It has an important role
in the induction of cell death in target cells.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Microtome for tissue sectioning
• Water bath (37°C to 50°C)
• Slide rack
• Humidity chamber
• Granzyme B primary antibody solution
• Secondary antibody solution
• DAB (diaminobenzidine) chromogen solution
• Hematoxylin counterstain
• Xylene and series of ethanol (100%, 95%, 70%)
• Coverslips and mounting medium
• Positive and negative control slides
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue blocks.
6. PROCEDURE
A. Tissue Sectioning
1. Section Thickness: Cut tissue sections at 3-5 microns using a
microtome.
2. Water Bath: Transfer the sections onto a water bath at 37°C to
50°C.
3. Slide Mounting: Mount the sections onto positively charged
slides and dry them overnight at room temperature or for 1 hour
at 60°C.
B. Deparaffinization and Rehydration
1. Xylene Bath: Place slides in xylene for 3 x 5 minutes.
2. Ethanol Series: Rehydrate through graded ethanol series
(100%, 95%, 70%) for 2 x 5 minutes each.
3. Water Rinse: Rinse slides in distilled water for 5 minutes.
C. Antigen Retrieval
1. Buffer: Choose appropriate antigen retrieval buffer (e.g.,
citrate, pH 6.0, or Tris-EDTA, pH 9.0) based on the antibody
supplier’s recommendation.
2. Heat Pretreatment: Perform heat pretreatment using a
microwave, pressure cooker, or water bath for the
recommended time and temperature.
3. Cool Down: Allow slides to cool down to room temperature for
at least 20 minutes.
4. Rinse: Rinse slides in distilled water.
D. Immunostaining
1. Blocking Step: Apply a blocking solution (e.g., 1% BSA or
normal serum) to the sections for 10 minutes to reduce
nonspecific binding.
2. Primary Antibody: Incubate sections with Granzyme B primary
antibody at the recommended dilution for 30-60 minutes in a
humidity chamber.
3. Wash: Rinse slides in PBS or TBS (with 0.05% Tween-20) for 3
x 5 minutes.
4. Secondary Antibody: Apply secondary antibody solution and
incubate for 30 minutes.
5. Wash: Repeat rinse (3 x 5 minutes).
E. Detection
1. DAB Solution: Apply DAB chromogen solution to the sections
for 5-10 minutes.
2. Water Rinse: Rinse slides with distilled water.
F. Counterstaining, Dehydration, and Mounting
1. Hematoxylin: Counterstain with hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes.
2. Water Rinse: Rinse in distilled water for 5 minutes.
3. Dehydration: Dehydrate through ethanol series (70%, 95%,
100%) for 5 minutes each.
4. Xylene: Clear sections in xylene for 2 x 5 minutes.
5. Mounting: Mount sections with coverslips using mounting
medium.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Control Slides: Include both a positive and a negative control
slide in every batch of staining.
2. Documentation: Record all details (date, time, technician
initials, antibody lot numbers, incubation times, and any
deviations) on the immunostain log.
3. Review: Evaluate staining quality microscopically.
8. TROUBLESHOOTING
1. Weak Staining: Check primary antibody dilution, ensure proper
antigen retrieval, and confirm adequate incubation times.
2. Background Staining: Ensure proper blocking, check for
excess washing, and confirm slide cleanliness.
3. No Staining: Check reagent expiration dates, confirm
specimen integrity, and verify correct application of reagents.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
Results should be reviewed and verified by a pathologist. Document
any findings and file all logs appropriately.
