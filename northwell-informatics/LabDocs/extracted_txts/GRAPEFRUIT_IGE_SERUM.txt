Standard Operating Procedure: Analytical Phase - GRAPEFRUIT,
IGE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the analytical procedures for the analysis of
Grapefruit-specific IgE in serum samples. The procedure ensures
accurate, precise, and reproducible results.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
All trained laboratory personnel must follow this SOP to ensure the
integrity and reliability of the test results. Laboratory supervisors are
responsible for ensuring compliance with this procedure.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND MATERIALS
• Equipment:
◦ Immunoassay Analyzer (e.g., Phadia ImmunoCAP system or
equivalent)
◦ Refrigerated centrifuge
◦ Calibrated pipettes
◦ Vortex mixer
◦ Incubation equipment (as per manufacturer’s guidelines)
◦ Computer with Laboratory Information System (LIS) access
• Reagents and Supplies:
◦ Grapefruit IgE-specific ImmunoCAP reagent kits
◦ Calibrators and Controls
◦ Serum separator tubes (SST) or red-top tubes
◦ Disposable pipette tips
◦ Personal protective equipment (PPE) including gloves and lab
coat
1. PROCEDURE
Sample Preparation:
• Specimen Requirements: Use serum samples collected in SST
or red-top tubes.
• Specimen Storage and Stability: After collection, samples must
be allowed to clot for 30 minutes and then centrifuged at 1500 x g
for 10 minutes. If not tested immediately, serum aliquots should
be stored at 2-8°C for up to 7 days or frozen at -20°C for longer
storage.
• Unacceptable Specimens: Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric
samples should be rejected as they may affect test results.
Assay Procedure:
1. Warm Reagents: Allow all reagents and serum samples to
reach room temperature.
2. Calibrator and Control Preparation: Thaw and vortex
calibrators and controls as required.
3. Sample Loading: Load calibrators, controls, and patient’s
serum samples into the appropriate wells of the assay plate or
insert tubes into the immunoassay analyzer.
4. Assay Running: Initiate the assay run following the
manufacturer’s instructions for the specific immunoassay
analyzer. This includes setting the machine parameters, placing
the reaction vessels, and initiating the analysis sequence.
5. Incubation: Incubate samples in accordance with
manufacturer’s instructions.
6. Washing: Perform wash cycles as per the automated protocol
included with the immunoassay analyzer.
7. Detection: Ensure that the detection phase is conducted as per
the manufacturer’s guidelines to measure the bound IgE.
Result Verification:
• Quality Control: Review quality control results to ensure they are
within the acceptable predetermined range.
• Review and Validation: Review raw data and analytical results in
the LIS system. Validate results based on calibration and control
performance.
• Reporting: Verify results and report through the LIS. Reference
values will be provided to clinicians as per laboratory-specific
guidelines.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform quality control with every assay run using high, medium,
and low-level controls.
• Document all QC results. If control results fall outside the
established ranges, do not report patient results. Investigate and
troubleshoot the issue, re-run controls, and ensure they are in
range before processing patient samples.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Report results in kU/L. Reference intervals for grapefruit-specific IgE
will be based on the established laboratory protocol and may be
adjusted based on population studies and clinical relevance:
• Negative: <0.35 kU/L
• Equivocal: 0.35-0.70 kU/L
• Positive: >0.70 kU/L
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Cross-reactivity: Some patients may show cross-reactivity with
other allergens.
• Analytical sensitivity and specificity are dependent on the assay
used. Refer to the manufacturer's insert for detailed limitations.
1. REFERENCES
Refer to the manufacturer’s product insert for the Grapefruit IgE-
specific ImmunoCAP for additional procedures, technical details, and
limitations.
Documentation:
• All steps taken and observations must be accurately documented
in the laboratory records, ensuring traceability and compliance
with quality standards.
Review and Audit:
• The SOP will be reviewed annually or whenever changes are
made to protocols or equipment. Laboratory audits will ensure
adherence to this SOP and identify opportunities for improvement.
