Analyte: Immunoglobulin E (IgE), Serum
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is to
outline the process for the analytical phase of generating results for
serum Immunoglobulin E (IgE) in the laboratory. The goal is to ensure
accurate, reliable, and reproducible results through standardized
procedures and quality control measures.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory staff are responsible for the
accurate and timely analysis of serum IgE, following prescribed
procedures. Supervisors are responsible for ensuring adherence to
protocol, maintaining necessary equipment, and addressing any
discrepancies or issues that may arise.
1. DEFINITION
Immunoglobulin E (IgE) is an antibody produced by the immune
system. Abnormally high levels of IgE can suggest allergic conditions
or other immune-related disorders.
1. PROCEDURE
Specimen Requirements: Preferred: Serum collected in a red top
tube or serum separator tube (SST). Specimen Stability: Serum
samples are stable for 48 hours when stored at 2-8°C. For long-term
storage, freeze samples at -20°C or below. Avoid repeated freeze-
thaw cycles.
A) Equipment and Reagents: • Immunoassay analyzer (e.g.,
ImmunoCAP, IMMULITE, or other similar platforms) • Calibration
material • Quality control materials (both high and low levels) • IgE-
specific assay kits
B) Analytical Procedure:
1. Calibration: • Perform calibration of the immunoassay analyzer
according to the manufacturer’s instructions and before running
patient samples. • Document calibration results in the
calibration log.
2. Quality Control: • Run QC material at both high and low levels
before patient samples. • Record QC results and verify that they
fall within the acceptable range. If QC results are outside the
acceptable range, troubleshoot and resolve issues before
processing patient samples. • Document any actions taken in
the QC log.
3. Sample Processing: • Thaw frozen samples at room
temperature, if applicable, and mix gently. • Centrifuge serum
samples at 1500-2500 rpm for 10 mins to remove any cells or
debris. • Load serum samples onto the immunoassay analyzer
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. • Begin the
analysis using the pre-set protocol for IgE on the analyzer.
4. Data Analysis and Reporting: • Review the generated data and
ensure that control samples have passed. • Identify and
investigate any flagged results, reprocess if necessary. •
Record patient results in the laboratory information system
(LIS). • Follow site-specific guidelines for reviewing and
verifying results before releasing them.
C) Maintenance and Troubleshooting: • Perform routine maintenance
on the immunoassay analyzer as recommended by the manufacturer.
• Document all maintenance activities. • If an analyzer error occurs,
troubleshoot following the manufacturer’s guidance and document
actions taken.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Normal Reference Range for Serum IgE: < 100 IU/mL • High levels
> 100 IU/mL: suggestive of allergic responses or other conditions
requiring further clinical evaluation.
1. QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE
• Ensure QC samples fall within the specified ranges. • Follow
procedures for recalibration, re-testing, and troubleshooting if any
results fall outside the expected performance criteria. • Document all
quality control and maintenance activities and retain logs for review.
