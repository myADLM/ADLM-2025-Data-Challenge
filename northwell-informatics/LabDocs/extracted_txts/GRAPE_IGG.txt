SOP for Analytical Phase of GRAPE IGG Testing
1. Purpose
To provide the procedures for accurately performing and
generating results for GRAPE IGG testing in the laboratory.
2. Specimen Requirements and Stability
◦ Preferred Specimen: Serum collected in a red-top or SST
(serum separator tube) vacutainer.
◦ Volume: Minimum of 1 mL of serum.
◦ Stability:
▪ Serum specimens are stable for up to 48 hours at 2-8°C.
▪ For longer storage, serum specimens can be frozen at
-20°C for up to 3 months.
3. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies
◦ GRAPE IGG ELISA Kit, including
▪ Microtiter plates pre-coated with GRAPE antigen.
▪ Wash buffer.
▪ Sample diluent.
▪ HRP-conjugated anti-human IGG.
▪ Substrate solution.
▪ Stop solution.
◦ Automated plate washer (if not available, manual washing
can be performed).
◦ Spectrophotometer or microplate reader capable of
reading absorbance at 450 nm.
◦ Calibrated micropipettes and tips.
◦ Disposable gloves.
◦ Lab coat and protective eyewear for safety.
4. Procedure
◦ Pre-analysis Preparation
▪ Ensure all reagents are brought to room temperature
(18-25°C) before use.
▪ Prepare wash buffer and sample diluent according to the
kit instructions.
◦ Sample Preparation
▪ Dilute serum samples 1:100 in sample diluent.
▪ Prepare calibrators and controls according to the kit’s
instructions.
◦ Assay Procedure
1. Coating and Blocking
▪ Add 100 µL of calibrators, controls, and diluted
patient samples to the respective wells of the pre-
coated microtiter plate.
▪ Incubate plate for 30 minutes at room temperature.
▪ Wash wells 3 times with 300 µL of wash buffer
each time.
2. Primary Antibody Incubation
▪ Add 100 µL of HRP-conjugated anti-human IGG to
each well.
▪ Incubate the plate for 30 minutes at room
temperature in a dark place.
▪ Wash wells 3 times with 300 µL of wash buffer
each time.
3. Substrate Reaction
▪ Add 100 µL of substrate solution to each well.
▪ Incubate for 15 minutes at room temperature in a
dark place.
4. Stopping Reaction
▪ Add 50 µL of stop solution to each well.
5. Reading Absorbance
▪ Read the plate at 450 nm using a microplate
reader within 30 minutes.
5. Quality Control
◦ Internal quality controls (positive and negative) must be
included in each run to ensure assay accuracy.
◦ Evaluate the control results first. If control values are out of
the expected range, troubleshoot the source of error before
proceeding with patient sample results.
◦ Inter-laboratory Quality Control: Analyzed monthly to
ensure consistency across batches and labs.
6. Data Interpretation
◦ Calculate the IGG concentration in patient samples using
the standard curve generated from the calibrators.
◦ Results should be reviewed by the technologist and verified
for consistency and accuracy.
◦ Reference interval for GRAPE IGG: 0 - 20 IU/mL.
7. Reporting Results
◦ Results are transmitted to the Laboratory Information
System (LIS) and must be reviewed by the technologist.
◦ In case of aberrant or critical values, re-test the sample to
confirm accuracy, and follow protocol to notify the physician
immediately.
8. Analytical Considerations and Method Limitations
◦ Verify sample integrity visually and with procedural checks.
◦ Hemolyzed and lipemic samples should be documented and
processed cautiously.
◦ Refer to the specific ELISA kit insert for detailed reagent
limitations and troubleshooting steps.

immunoassays.
This SOP outlines methodologies designed to ensure accurate and
reliable results for GRAPE IGG testing. Compliance with these steps
will ensure high standards are maintained in the analytical phase.
