Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
1. Title: GRASS Panel #1, Serum Analysis
2. Purpose:
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedures for the analytical
phase of GRASS Panel #1 testing on serum samples to ensure
consistency, accuracy, and reliability of results.
3. Scope:
This procedure applies to all CLS and MLT personnel trained in
performing the GRASS Panel #1 analysis within the laboratory.
4. Definitions/Acronyms:
CLS: Clinical Laboratory Scientist MLT: Medical Laboratory
Technician PPE: Personal Protective Equipment QC: Quality Control
5. Responsibilities:
• CLS/MLT personnel are responsible for performing and
documenting all aspects of the GRASS Panel #1 analysis,
including sample preparation, running the assay, and recording
the results.
• Laboratory supervisors are responsible for ensuring that
personnel are trained and proficient in this procedure.
6. Specimen:
• Accepted: Serum from a properly collected and labeled red top
tube, centrifuged and aliquoted.
• Rejected: Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples, or samples not
properly labeled or collected.
7. Equipment and Reagents:
• GRASS Panel #1 kit
• Microplate reader with appropriate filters
• Pipettes and tips
• Microcentrifuge
• PPE (gloves, lab coat, safety goggles)
• Deionized water
• Calibrators and controls provided with the kit
• Timer
8. Quality Control:
• Run QC samples (both positive and negative controls) each day
prior to patient samples to ensure assay performance validity.
• Document QC results and take corrective actions if QC values fall
outside the acceptable range.
9. Procedure:
A. Sample Preparation:
1. Thaw frozen serum samples, if applicable, at room
temperature.
2. Mix the samples gently by inversion. Avoid creating bubbles.
3. Centrifuge if necessary to remove any particulates/debris.
B. Assay Setup:
1. Allow all reagents and the microplate to come to room
temperature before use.
2. Prepare the microplate according to the GRASS Panel #1 kit
instructions, ensuring all wells are properly prepared with the
appropriate reagents and samples.
3. Pipette the serum samples, calibrators, and controls into
designated wells on the microplate according to kit instructions.
C. Incubation:
1. Incubate the plate for the specified time and temperature as
indicated in the kit insert. Follow all steps accurately.
2. Ensure the microplate is covered or sealed if indicated to
prevent evaporation.
D. Reading the Plate:
1. After the incubation period, follow the instructions for washing
and/or developing the plate, as indicated in the kit.
2. Read the plate using a microplate reader set to the appropriate
wavelength as specified by the GRASS Panel #1 instructions.
E. Data Analysis:
1. Ensure the microplate reader software accurately calculates the
concentrations of allergens or antibodies, using the calibrators
provided.
2. Review all data for accuracy and completeness.
10. Reporting Results:
1. Verify that QC results are within acceptable limits before
releasing patient results.
2. Enter results into the laboratory information system (LIS) and
review for any critical values or unusual findings. Follow
laboratory policy for handling critical values.
3. Release results to the appropriate healthcare provider after
verification.
11. Method Limitations:
• Refer to the GRASS Panel #1 kit insert for specific limitations of
the assay, including any potential interferences from substances
typically found in serum samples.
12. Reference Intervals:
• Establish reference intervals as provided by the manufacturer or
validate site-specific intervals based on guidelines and patient
population.
13. References:
• GRASS Panel #1 kit insert and associated documents.
• Laboratory Quality Assurance policy manual.
14. Document History:
• Document revisions and review dates here.
15. Appendices:
• Include any specific forms, logs, or additional procedural details
as needed.
