5. PROCEDURE
5.1 Preparation
1. Reagent Preparation:
◦ All reagents and kit components must be brought to room
temperature (~20-25°C) before use.
◦ Prepare the wash buffer, substrate solution, and stop
solution according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Ensure that the calibration curve reagents are prepared for
generating a standard curve.
2. Quality Control Materials:
◦ Ensure that the QC materials are thawed and brought to
room temperature.
◦ Mix gently to avoid bubbles which can interfere with the
accuracy of pipetting.
5.2 Equipment Setup
1. Calibration:
◦ Ensure the ELISA reader (or specified analyzer) is
calibrated according to the manufacturer’s guidelines.
◦ Temperature settings for incubators should be set to 37°C ±
0.5°C.
5.3 Sample Preparation
1. Handling and Pre-treatment:
◦ Ensure serum samples are properly labeled and have been
stored at the correct temperature.
◦ Thaw frozen serum samples at room temperature. Mix
gently to ensure a homogenous solution before handling.
2. Dilution:
◦ Dilution of serum samples should be done according to the
specific assay requirements. Prepare samples in dilution
buffer as specified in the assay kit manual.
5.4 Assay Performance
1. Plate Setup:
◦ Allocate wells for blank, standards, controls, and serum
samples as per the kit instructions.
◦ Pipette the standards and samples within the designated
wells.
2. Pipetting and Incubation:
◦ Follow the sequence of reagent addition according to the kit
protocol.
◦ Incubate plates for the specified time at the specific
temperature (usually 37°C).
◦ Wash the plates with the prepared wash buffer according to
the specified number of wash cycles.
3. Detection:
◦ Add the substrate solution and incubate for the
recommended time away from direct light.
◦ Add stop solution to terminate the reaction.
5.5 Reading and Data Analysis
1. Reading Results:
◦ Measure the optical density (OD) at the recommended
wavelength using the ELISA reader.
2. Data Analysis:
◦ Generate the standard curve using the calibration standards
measured on the same plate.
◦ Calculate the concentration of analytes in the serum
samples using the curve.
5.6 Quality Control
• Run the QC material alongside the samples to ensure the validity
of the test.
• Evaluate the QC results against the control chart provided. If QC
data is outside the acceptable range, repeat the assay.
5.7 Reporting Results
1. Verification:
◦ Verify the test results by cross-referencing with QC results.
◦ Any outliers or suspicious results should be investigated and
the assay repeated if necessary.
2. Documentation:
◦ Record all relevant data in the lab information system (LIS).
◦ Ensure that the recorded data includes sample
identification, batch number, test results, and QC results.
3. Result Report Communication:
◦ Results are reviewed by the technologist and verified by a
supervisor before being validated in the LIS.
◦ Ensure prompt communication of critical results to the
treating physician as per the laboratory’s policy.

7. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If results indicate significant deviations from expected values,
recalibrate the instrument and verify reagent integrity.
• Repeat the assay with new reagents and fresh standards if QC
fails repeatedly.
• Consult the manufacturer's guidelines or consult with the
supervisor for persistent issues.
8. TRAINING/COMPETENCY ASSESSMENT
• Laboratory personnel must be trained and demonstrate
competency in this SOP. Regular assessments should be
conducted to ensure ongoing compliance and understanding of
procedures.
By following this SOP, the accuracy and reliability of GRASS PANEL
#2, SERUM analyses can be ensured, supporting comprehensive
patient care through precise diagnostic information.
