Standard Operating Procedure: Analytical Phase for Generating
Results for GRASS PANEL #3, SERUM
1. PURPOSE To outline the procedure for the analysis of serum
samples for GRASS Panel #3 and ensure that results are
generated accurately and efficiently.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory technologists are responsible
for performing the analysis, maintaining equipment, and documenting
results and quality control measures. Laboratory supervisors are
responsible for verifying adherence to this protocol and addressing
any deviations or anomalies.
1. SCOPE This procedure applies to all serum samples received
for the GRASS Panel #3 analysis, which includes a range of
allergen-specific IgE assays.
2. DEFINITIONS GRASS Panel #3: A set of tests determining the
presence of allergen-specific IgE antibodies to various grass
allergens in serum samples.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• ImmunoCAP 250 instrument (or approved equivalent)
• Specific allergens for GRASS Panel #3
• Serum samples
• Quality control sera
• Calibrators
• Pipettes and tips
• Disposable gloves
• Barcode labels
• Centrifuge (if needed)
1. PROCEDURE
5.1 Sample Preparation and Handling
• Ensure all serum samples are correctly labeled with patient
identification and accession numbers.
• Centrifuge serum samples at 1500 x g for 10 minutes if needed to
separate serum from blood cells.
• Check the integrity of each sample; if a sample is hemolyzed,
lipemic, or icteric, document and notify the supervisor.
5.2 Equipment Calibration and Maintenance
• Perform daily calibration of the ImmunoCAP 250 instrument as
per manufacturer's instructions.
• Run quality control (QC) serum samples (negative and positive
control) to ensure instrument accuracy.
• Document calibration and QC results in the instrument log.
5.3 Testing Procedure
• Load allergen-specific reagents and calibrators into the
ImmunoCAP 250 instrument.
• Label serum samples with barcodes and load them into the
specified sample tray positions.
• Program the sequence and start the analysis as per ImmunoCAP
250 user manual.
• Monitor the instrument for any error messages and take
appropriate corrective actions.
5.4 Quality Control and Validation
• Include QC samples in every run to verify the accuracy and
reliability of results.
• Refer to the manufacturer’s recommended target ranges for
positive and negative controls.
• Accept QC results only if they are within the specified ranges.
• If QC results are out of range, troubleshoot, rerun the controls,
and document corrective actions.
5.5 Result Analysis
• Once the run is completed, review raw data generated by the
instrument.
• Verify that all allergen-specific IgE results fall within the analytical
measurement range.
• Review QC results and troubleshoot inconsistencies.
• Interpret results according to the laboratory’s reference ranges
provided in the instrument manual.
5.6 Documentation and Reporting
• Document all analytical details including date, time, technologist’s
initials, and any deviations from the standard procedure.
• Record results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Ensure all results are reviewed and verified by another
technologist or supervisor before releasing them.
• Report any critical results per laboratory policy and procedure.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Allergen-Specific IgE: Interpretation ranges and reference
intervals are specified in the manufacturer's insert included with
the ImmunoCAP assay kits.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to ImmunoCAP 250 manual and insert for assay-specific
limitations including potential interferences and cross-reactivity.
1. REFERENCES
• ImmunoCAP 250 User Manual
• Manufacturer’s insert for Allergen-specific IgE assay kits
1. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS
• Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) at all
times.
• Follow proper waste disposal procedures for biological and
chemical materials.
• Ensure detailed documentation of all steps and any discrepancies
noted during analysis.
This protocol ensures the reliable and accurate generation of results
for GRASS Panel #3, Serum tests and supports adherence to quality
standards set by CLIA.
