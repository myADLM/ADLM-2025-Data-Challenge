GRB2-ASSOCIATED BINDING PROTEIN 1 (GAB1) Immunostain:
Technical Component Only Protocol
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this protocol is to outline the procedure for the
technical component only of immunohistochemical staining for
GRB2-Associated Binding Protein 1 (GAB1) using an automated
immunostainer in a clinical laboratory setting. This process aims to
ensure consistent and accurate generation of GAB1 staining results
on tissue sections.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Acceptable Specimen Types:
• Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks.
Specimen Preparation:
• Tissue sections should be cut at 4-5 micrometers thick.
• Sections should be mounted on positively charged slides.
• Ensure slides are properly labeled with patient identification and
accession numbers.
3. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
Equipment:
• Microtome for sectioning FFPE tissues.
• Automated immunostainer (e.g., Ventana Benchmark Ultra, Leica
Bond III, or equivalent).
• Hot air oven or slide dryer.
• Coverslipping machine or manual coverslipping tools.
• Microscope for slide evaluation.
Reagents:
• Primary antibody against GAB1 (validated for IHC use).
• Suitable secondary detection system (Polymer-based detection,
HRP conjugates, etc.).
• Antigen retrieval solution (citrate buffer or EDTA, pH as specified
by the primary antibody datasheet).
• Counterstaining reagent (e.g., Hematoxylin).
• Mounting medium.
4. PROCEDURE
A) Slide Preparation and Sectioning:
1. Cut FFPE tissue blocks into 4-5 micrometer sections using a
microtome.
2. Float sections on a water bath and pick them up onto positively
charged glass slides.
3. Place slides in a hot air oven or slide dryer at 60°C for a
minimum of 1 hour to ensure adherence of tissue sections.
B) Immunostaining Procedure using Automated Stainer:
1. Load prepared slides onto the appropriate platform of the
automated immunostainer.
2. Select the appropriate staining protocol for GAB1:
◦ Program antigen retrieval step as required (e.g., 20 minutes
in citrate buffer, pH 6.0).
◦ Incubate with the primary antibody against GAB1 as
specified by the manufacturer (e.g., 30 minutes at room
temperature).
◦ Carry out the steps for secondary antibody incubation and
detection system according to the automated stainer
settings.
◦ Apply the counterstain (e.g., Hematoxylin) and rinse slides
following the designated program.
C) Post-Immunostaining Handling:
1. Remove slides from the automated stainer and rinse with
distilled water.
2. Dehydrate through graded alcohols and clear in xylene.
3. Mount sections using a suitable mounting medium and apply
coverslips.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
Internal Quality Control:
• Each staining run should include appropriate positive and
negative controls.
• Positive control: Tissues known to express GAB1.
• Negative control: Omission of the primary antibody or using an
isotype control.
Documentation:
• Document antibody lot numbers, expiration dates, and any
deviations from the protocol.
• Record control results to ensure consistency and reproducibility.
6. TROUBLESHOOTING
Common Issues:
• Non-specific staining: Ensure accurate dilution of the primary
antibody, proper antigen retrieval, and optimal incubation times.
• Weak staining: Evaluate the concentration of the primary
antibody, antigen retrieval conditions, and reagent expiration
dates.
• No staining: Check for correct reagent application, intact
detection system functionality, and verification of the primary
antibody.
In case of persistent issues, repeat the staining with adjustments or
consult with a supervisor for further troubleshooting steps.
7. REPORTING AND REVIEW
Technical Component Reporting:
• Provide the stained slides along with control slides to the
pathologist for interpretation.
• Note the staining run date, slide identification, and any
observations regarding the staining quality in the laboratory
information system (LIS).
8. REFERENCES
References can include:
• Manufacturer’s datasheet for the GAB1 primary antibody.
• Automated stainer user manual.
• Relevant laboratory standard operating procedures (SOPs) for
immunohistochemical (IHC) staining techniques.
9. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of laboratory personnel to:
• Adhere strictly to this protocol.
• Identify and report any deviations or quality control issues to the
laboratory supervisor.
• Ensure continuous education and training in IHC techniques and
updates to protocols.
By following this protocol, the laboratory ensures the reliable and
reproducible performance of GAB1 immunostaining, providing critical
support in the diagnostic process.
