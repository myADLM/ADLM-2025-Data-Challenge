Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase:
Generation of Results for Greek Fennel, IgE, Serum
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized method for the quantitative determination
of Immunoglobulin E (IgE) specific to Greek Fennel (Foeniculum
vulgare) in human serum samples using an enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method. This ensures consistent and
accurate results necessary for clinical diagnosis and allergen-specific
immunotherapy management.
2. DEFINITIONS
IgE: Immunoglobulin E, an antibody associated with allergic
reactions.
ELISA: Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay, a common laboratory
technique used to measure the concentration of an antibody in a
sample.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• ELISA plate reader
• ELISA washer
• Incubator (37°C)
• Precision pipettes and tips
• Refrigerators (2-8°C)
• Freezers (-20°C)
Reagents:
• Greek Fennel IgE ELISA kit (specific for Foeniculum vulgare)
• Substrate solution (TMB)
• Stop solution (2N H2SO4)
• Wash buffer
• Diluent buffer
• Standards and controls
Supplies:
• 96-well microplates
• Polypropylene microtubes
• Adhesive plate seals
• Calibration and log sheets
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen Type: Serum Volume Required: Minimum of 200 µL
Collection: Use standard venipuncture technique for blood
collection; allow blood to clot and centrifuge to separate serum.
Stability: Serum samples should be refrigerated at 2-8°C and
analyzed within seven days. For longer storage, freeze aliquots at
-20°C. Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
Internal Quality Control:
• Run low and high concentration controls with each assay batch.
• Document all control results and take corrective action if values
fall outside acceptable ranges.
External Quality Assurance:
• Participate in proficiency testing programs and perform external
quality assessments periodically.
6. PROCEDURE
Step 1: Plate Preparation
1. Equilibrate all reagents and samples to room temperature
before use.
2. Label the microplate wells for standards, controls, and samples.
Step 2: Sample and Standard Addition
1. Prepare standards according to the ELISA kit instructions.
2. Dilute serum samples 1:10 in diluent buffer or as specified in
the kit protocol.
3. Add 100 µL of standards, controls, and diluted serum samples
to the designated wells in duplicates.
4. Seal the plate and incubate at 37°C for 1 hour.
Step 3: Washing the Plate
1. Wash the plate 3-5 times with wash buffer using an ELISA
washer.
2. Tap the plate gently on absorbent paper to remove excess
wash buffer.
Step 4: Adding Detection Antibody
1. Add 100 µL of detection antibody to each well.
2. Seal the plate and incubate at 37°C for 30 minutes.
Step 5: Substrate Reaction
1. Add 100 µL of TMB substrate solution to each well.
2. Allow the reaction to proceed in the dark at room temperature
for 15 minutes.
Step 6: Stopping the Reaction
1. Add 50 µL of stop solution to each well to terminate the
reaction.
2. Gently tap the plate to ensure thorough mixing.
Step 7: Reading the Plate
1. Read the absorbance of each well at 450 nm using the ELISA
plate reader within 30 minutes of stopping the reaction.
7. CALCULATING RESULTS
1. Generate a standard curve by plotting the average absorbance
of the standards against their known concentrations.
2. Determine the IgE concentration of the samples by interpolating
their absorbances from the standard curve.
3. Ensure all values fall within the assay's defined range. Any
results above the highest standard should be diluted and re-
assayed.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Record all sample results in the laboratory information system
(LIS).
• Verify and review results before approval.
• Notify the requesting physician or healthcare provider promptly in
case of critical results.
9. TROUBLESHOOTING
• Verify the quality control results are within acceptable ranges
before interpreting sample results.
• Consult the ELISA kit insert for troubleshooting tips if
encountering inconsistent or unexpected results.
• Document any deviations from the SOP and corrective actions
taken.
