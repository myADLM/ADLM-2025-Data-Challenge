STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP) FOR ANALYSIS OF
GREEN PEA, IGE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedures for the analysis
of Green Pea IgE in serum, including the preparation, processing,
and documentation required to ensure accurate and reliable test
results.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
• Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing
the analysis as outlined in this procedure.
• Supervisors ensure adherence to the procedures and proper
training of all personnel involved in the analysis.
• All staff must identify and report any deviations and take
appropriate corrective actions.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Serum
• Preferred Collection Tube: Serum Separator Tube (SST) or red-
top tube without anticoagulant.
• Volume: Minimum of 0.5 mL of serum.
• Stability: Serum specimens should be stored at 2-8°C for up to 7
days. For longer storage, specimens should be frozen at -20°C or
lower.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Analyzer: Suitable Immunoassay Analyzer (e.g., ImmunoCAP
system)
• Reagents: Green Pea (Pisum sativum) specific IgE reagent kit
• Controls: Manufacturer-provided positive and negative controls
specific to Green Pea IgE
• Calibration materials: Provided by the manufacturer
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes and tips
• Disposable gloves and lab coats
• Documentation Forms: Daily Run Sheet, Temperature Monitoring
Log, Calibration Log
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation
1. Ensure that the immunoassay analyzer is properly calibrated
and has passed all quality control checks.
2. Allow all reagents and specimens to reach room temperature
before starting the assay.
3. Centrifuge blood collection tubes at 3000 RPM for 10 minutes
to separate serum if not already separated.
B. Assay Procedure
1. Label the sample tubes clearly with patient identification.
2. Follow the ImmunoCAP system’s instructions for loading serum
samples, calibrators, and controls: a. Pipette 100 µL of each
calibrator, control, and patient serum into the respective wells.
b. Load the samples onto the ImmunoCAP instrument.
3. Start the assay run according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
4. Upon completion, review the results generated by the
immunoassay system.
C. Handling Out-of-Range and Invalid Results
1. If any results fall outside of the acceptable range, repeat the
assay for the affected samples.
2. If repeated results remain outside the acceptable range, verify
the quality of the reagents and the performance of the analyzer
and troubleshoot any issues before repeating the assay.
3. Document any corrective actions taken in the Daily Run Sheet.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run positive and negative controls with each batch of patient
samples.
• Implement internal and external quality assurance programs as
outlined by the laboratory's quality management system.
• Review Quality Control (QC) data regularly to ensure consistent
assay performance.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• All results must be reviewed and verified by the technologist.
• Report results according to the laboratory's reporting policies and
procedures.
• Critical values or unexpected findings must be communicated to
the appropriate medical personnel immediately and documented
accordingly.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• The normal reference range for specific IgE levels concerning
Green Pea will be determined based on the reference provided by
the reagent manufacturer and clinical guidelines.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to the reagent manufacturer's product insert for detailed
information on assay limitations.
• Ensure that all handling procedures avoid cross-contamination,
contamination of reagents or specimens, and that all steps are
performed within the specified time frames and temperature
ranges.
