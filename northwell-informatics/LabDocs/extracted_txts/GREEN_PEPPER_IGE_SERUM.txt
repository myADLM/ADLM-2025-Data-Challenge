Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for GREEN PEPPER, IGE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE:
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the analytical phase of
generating results for Green Pepper, IgE, Serum in a clinical
laboratory. This protocol ensures accurate and reliable test results by
providing a standardized approach for laboratory personnel.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing the
analysis according to this SOP. Supervisors are responsible for
ensuring compliance and addressing any issues.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS:
Preferred Specimen:
• Serum collected in a red-top or serum separator tube (SST).
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric specimens.
• Specimens collected in tubes containing anticoagulants (e.g.,
EDTA, heparin).
Processing:
• Allow blood to clot at room temperature for 30 minutes, centrifuge
for 10-15 minutes at 1,000-1,300 g.
• Transfer serum into a labeled polypropylene tube, if necessary,
and store at 2-8°C for up to 48 hours. For longer storage, freeze
at -20°C or colder.
1. PRINCIPLE OF THE TEST:
This assay quantitatively measures specific IgE antibodies to Green
Pepper in human serum using a standardized immunoassay method
such as Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) or
ImmunoCAP.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES:
• ELISA reader or automated immunoassay analyzer
• Green Pepper-specific IgE test kits
• Calibrators, controls, and wash buffer
• Incubation chambers
• Micropipettes and tips
• Centrifuge
1. PROCEDURE:
A) Preparation
• Bring all reagents and samples to room temperature before use.
• Ensure the assay kit components match the lot numbers.
B) Calibration and Quality Control
• Run calibrators and control samples at the beginning of each
assay.
• Ensure controls are within the established acceptable ranges
before proceeding with patient samples.
C) Sample Analysis
• Label assay plate wells or test tubes accordingly.
• Add a specified volume (e.g., 100 μL) of patient serum,
calibrators, and controls to the wells or tubes.
• Follow the manufacturer's instructions for incubation times and
temperatures.
◦ Typical incubation at 37±2°C for 60 minutes.
• Wash the wells with the provided buffer according to the kit's
protocol to remove unbound components.
• Add detection antibody conjugate and incubate as directed (e.g.,
30 minutes at room temperature).
• Wash wells thoroughly, then add the substrate solution.
• Allow color development for the specified period (e.g., 15-30
minutes).
• Add the stop solution and read the optical density (OD) at the
specified wavelength using an ELISA reader or analyzer (e.g.,
450 nm).
D) Result Calculation
• Generate a standard curve using the OD values of the calibrators
with known IgE concentrations.
• Determine the IgE concentration in patient samples by comparing
their OD values to the standard curve.
• Document all calculations and results accurately.
1. REPORTING RESULTS:
• Verify and review results before reporting.
• Ensure all patient information is accurately matched.
• Document any results falling outside the established reference
ranges.
• Report results in kU/L (kilo units per liter).
Critical Values:
• Ensure immediate communication of any critical values to the
relevant healthcare provider following the laboratory's critical
value policy.
Interpretation:
• Reference ranges will depend on the assay kit's specific
guidelines. Generally, IgE levels are considered:
◦ < 0.35 kU/L: Negative
◦ 0.35 - 0.70 kU/L: Borderline
◦ 0.70 kU/L: Positive
1. QUALITY CONTROL:
• Perform and document routine maintenance on equipment.
• Run quality controls with each assay batch.
• Investigate any out-of-range controls, recalibrate if necessary, and
repeat the analysis.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
Refer to the manufacturer's instructions for specific assay limitations
such as cross-reactivity, interference, or sample instability.
