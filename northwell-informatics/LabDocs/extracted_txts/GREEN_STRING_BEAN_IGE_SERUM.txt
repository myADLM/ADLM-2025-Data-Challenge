Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for GREEN STRING BEAN, IGE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the steps for the analytical phase of testing serum
for Immunoglobulin E (IgE) specific to Green String Bean allergen.
This includes reagent preparation, sample processing, equipment
handling, quality control, and result reporting.
Responsibility:
The laboratory technologist is responsible for performing the testing
and ensuring adherence to this SOP. The supervisor is tasked with
overseeing the procedure and addressing any non-conformities or
deviations from the SOP.
1. DEFINITION
IgE is an antibody associated with allergic reactions and is measured
to assess the presence of allergen-specific IgE in patient serum.
1. SPECIMEN
• Preferred/Acceptable:
◦ 1-2 mL of serum collected in a plain red-top tube or serum
separator tube (SST).
◦ Specimen should be collected and transported to the
laboratory within 2 hours of collection, kept at 2-8°C.
• Unacceptable:
◦ Hemolysed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
◦ Specimens that are stored at room temperature for more than
8 hours.
Note: For long-term storage, freeze the serum at -20°C or lower.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Automated Immunoassay Analyzer (e.g., Immulite, Phadia)
• Green String Bean IgE reagent kit
• Calibrators specific to the assay
• Quality control materials (positive and negative controls)
• Pipettes and tips
• Serological centrifuge
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation:
1. Prepare Workspace:
◦ Ensure all surfaces are clean and free of contaminants.
◦ Wear appropriate PPE.
2. Reagent and Control Preparation:
◦ Consult the manufacturer’s instructions for preparation and
storage conditions.
◦ Bring all reagents, calibrators, and controls to room
temperature before use (unless otherwise specified).
B. Sample Handling and Preparation:
1. Serum Separation:
◦ Centrifuge the blood specimens at 3,000 rpm for 10 minutes
to separate the serum.
◦ Carefully pipette the serum into a clean sample tube,
ensuring no contamination.
2. Loading Samples:
◦ Label the tubes appropriately with patient ID and test
information.
◦ Load the serum samples, calibrators, and quality controls
into the designated positions of the immunoassay analyzer.
C. Instrument Handling:
1. Operation of Immunoassay Analyzer:
◦ Power on the instrument and perform initial checks as per
the manufacturer's guidelines.
◦ Verify the calibration status and load the calibration curve if
necessary.
2. Running the Test:
◦ Select the Green String Bean, IgE test on the analyzer’s
interface.
◦ Confirm that all samples, calibrators, and controls are
correctly positioned.
◦ Initiate the run and monitor the process periodically.
D. Quality Control:
1. Run Controls:
◦ Quality controls must be run with each batch of samples.
◦ Both positive and negative controls must fall within
acceptable ranges determined by the manufacturer.
◦ Document the control results in the Quality Control log.
2. Troubleshooting:
◦ If controls are out of range, troubleshoot as per the
analyzer's troubleshooting guide.
◦ Do not release patient results until quality control issues are
resolved.
E. Result Verification and Reporting:
1. Review Results:
◦ Results are automatically transmitted to the Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
◦ Technologist to review raw data for any flags or errors.
◦ Confirm quality control results before verifying patient
results.
2. Reporting:
◦ Verified results are entered into the LIS for electronic
reporting.
◦ Critical values, if any, should be immediately communicated
to the attending physician.
3. REFERENCE INTERVALS:
• IgE levels will be interpreted based on clinical context and
allergen-specific threshold values:
◦ Allergen-specific IgE levels (kUA/L): - 0 - 0.34: Negative - 0.35
- 0.69: Low positive - 0.70 - 3.49: Moderate positive - 3.50 -
17.49: High positive - 17.50 - 49.99: Very high positive - ≥ 50:
Extremely high positive
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
Refer to the specific immunoassay analyzer and reagent kit insert for
potential interferences, limitations, and detailed procedural steps.
