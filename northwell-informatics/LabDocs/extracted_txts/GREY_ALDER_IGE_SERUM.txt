Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase:
Generating Results for GREY ALDER, IGE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the protocol for the analytical
phase of generating results for the Grey Alder-specific
Immunoglobulin E (IgE) in serum samples. This ensures that testing
is accurate, consistent, and follows regulatory requirements.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory staff are responsible for
performing the analytical procedures as defined in this SOP, ensuring
proper maintenance, calibration of equipment, and documentation of
results.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/Acceptable Specimen:
• 5 mL venous blood collected in SST (Serum Separation Tube),
allowed to clot for 30 minutes at room temperature, centrifuged
within 2 hours of collection.
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Specimens collected in improper tubes (e.g., EDTA or heparin
tubes).
• Specimens that have gross hemolysis or lipemia.
• Specimens received more than 48 hours after collection without
refrigeration.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
ImmunoCAP 250/500
• Store at room temperature (18-25°C).
• Each reagent kit is stable until the expiry date on the label.
• All reagents must be at room temperature before use.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Pre-Analytical Preparation:
1. Sanitize working area.
2. Ensure all equipment is calibrated and functional.
3. Confirm specimen integrity and appropriateness.
B. Specimen Handling:
1. Verify that the serum specimen is properly centrifuged and free
of clot or hemolysis.
2. If refrigerated, allow the serum sample to reach room
temperature before analysis.
C. Running the ImmunoCAP Assay:
1. Load serum samples into the ImmunoCAP instrument
according to manufacturer's guidelines.
2. Program the instrument with the appropriate test parameters for
Grey Alder IgE.
3. Ensure the reagents are loaded and that the instrument has
completed its calibration cycle.
D. Quality Control:
1. Run both positive and negative controls with each batch.
2. Controls must fall within the pre-defined range. If controls fail,
troubleshoot according to the manufacturer’s guidance and
repeat the batch.
3. Record QC results in the laboratory logbook.
E. Generating Results:
1. Upon completion of the assay, review the instrument-generated
results.
2. Validate the results according to internal quality standards.
3. Compare the results against reference intervals for Grey Alder
IgE:
◦ Negative: <0.35 kU/L
◦ Low Positive: 0.35 – 2.00 kU/L
◦ Moderate Positive: 2.01 – 17.50 kU/L
◦ High Positive: >17.50 kU/L
4. REPORTING RESULTS:
5. Enter the validated results into the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
6. Ensure proper documentation, including patient identification,
date of test, result, and technologist verification.
7. Report any critical findings to the appropriate medical
professional as per laboratory policy.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
Refer to the ImmunoCAP product insert for specific test pad
limitations and interferences that may impact results.
