Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Group B
Streptococcus (GBS) Screening
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the detection and reporting
of Group B Streptococcus (GBS) in prenatal patients to prevent
neonatal infection. The testing procedure will ensure accurate and
timely results using appropriate laboratory techniques.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of designated lab personnel to perform and
document all steps of the GBS screening procedure in accordance
with this SOP.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Vaginal/rectal swabs
• Handling and Transport: Specimens must be transported to the
laboratory in a suitable transport medium (e.g., Amies transport
medium) and should be processed as soon as possible.
◦ If delays are anticipated, store the specimen at 4 °C and
process within 24 hours.
4. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Bovine heart infusion (BHI) broth
• CNA agar plates
• Todd-Hewitt broth (containing selective antibiotics) or Granada
agar (for enhanced GBS detection)
• GBS specific agglutination reagent or molecular testing reagents
(if using PCR)
• Incubator set to 35-37°C
5. PROCEDURE
5.1. Initial Culture:
1. Labeling: Ensure that each specimen container is properly
labeled with patient identification information.
2. Inoculation:
◦ Using aseptic technique, inoculate the collected swabs into
BHI broth.
◦ Vortex the tubes to release organisms from the swab.
3. Incubation:
◦ Incubate the BHI broth at 35-37°C for 18-24 hours.
5.2. Subculture to Selective Medium:
1. Subculturing:
◦ After incubation, subculture a loopful of the BHI broth to
CNA agar plates and/or selective Todd-Hewitt broth or
Granada agar.
2. Incubation:
◦ Incubate the plates/broth at 35-37°C for 24-48 hours in
ambient atmosphere.
5.3. Result Interpretation:
1. Examine Plates:
◦ Examine CNA agar plates for growth of beta-hemolytic
colonies suspected to be GBS.
◦ If using Granada agar, look for orange or red colonies,
indicating GBS.
2. Confirmatory Testing:
◦ Perform catalase test (GBS is catalase negative).
◦ For colonies suspected to be GBS:
▪ Use latex agglutination test specific for GBS antigens
▪ Alternatively, perform molecular testing (e.g., PCR) for
the confirmation of GBS presence.
5.4. Reporting Results:
1. Documentation:
◦ Document results of the GBS screen in the laboratory
information system (LIS).
2. Notification:
◦ Positive results should be communicated to the requesting
healthcare provider as soon as possible to ensure
appropriate clinical management.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include positive and negative control strains in each batch of tests
to ensure accuracy of results.
• Incubators and temperature-dependent equipment used in the
procedure should be monitored daily to ensure consistent
temperature settings.
• Record all quality control results and take corrective action if
controls do not perform as expected.
7. LIMITATIONS
• Improper collection, handling, or delay in transport of the
specimen can lead to false-negative results.
• Non-hemolytic GBS strains might not be detected on CNA agar
alone and may require the use of selective broths or molecular
methods.
8. REFERENCES
• CDC guidelines for the prevention of Group B Streptococcal
disease.
• Manufacturer's instructions for the use of GBS agglutination
reagent and molecular testing kits.
By adhering to this SOP, the laboratory ensures consistent, accurate,
and timely screening for Group B Streptococcus, contributing to the
effective management of pregnant patients and the prevention of
neonatal GBS disease.
