Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) For Growth Differentiation
Factor 15 (GDF-15), Plasma Analysis
1. PURPOSE
To provide standardized and accurate procedures for the
measurement of Growth Differentiation Factor 15 (GDF-15) levels in
plasma to ensure quality and consistency in patient results.
Responsibility:
All laboratory technicians and scientists are responsible for following
this SOP when performing GDF-15 analysis. The laboratory
supervisor is responsible for overseeing compliance and proper
documentation of all steps and corrective actions.
1. PRINCIPLE AND/OR PURPOSE
GDF-15 is a member of the transforming growth factor-beta cytokine
superfamily and is involved in various physiological processes,
including inflammation, cell repair, and growth. The measurement of
GDF-15 in plasma is instrumental in clinical diagnostics and
management of patients with cardiovascular, metabolic, and cancer-
related diseases.
1. SPECIMEN
Preferred/Acceptable:
• Plasma collected in EDTA anticoagulant tubes.
◦ Collect minimum of 2 mL plasma.
◦ Centrifuge immediately at 1000-2000 x g for 10-15 minutes at
4-25°C.
Unacceptable:
• Specimens received in heparin or sodium citrate tubes.
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
• Plasma collected more than 6 hours prior to analysis without
proper storage conditions.
Storage:
• Plasma samples should be stored frozen at -20°C or below if the
analysis is not performed immediately.
• Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
1. REAGENTS AND EQUIPMENT
Reagents:
• GDF-15 Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) Kit or
equivalent, which includes:
◦ Microplate coated with polyclonal antibody specific for human
GDF-15
◦ Standard GDF-15 calibrators
◦ Assay buffer
◦ Detection antibody conjugated to an enzyme
◦ Substrate solution
◦ Stop solution
◦ Wash buffer
Equipment:
• Microplate reader capable of reading absorbance at specified
wavelengths.
• Microplate washer or appropriate alternative.
• Pipettes and pipette tips.
• Centrifuge.
• Vortex mixer.
• Incubator set at 37°C.
• Refrigerator (2-8°C) and freezer (-20°C or below).
• Temperature-controlled water bath (optional).
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) including gloves, lab coat,
and safety glasses.
1. PROCEDURE
a. Preparation:
• Calibrate all equipment as necessary.
• Thaw samples, standards, and reagents before beginning the
assay.
b. Assay Protocol:
1. Prepare all reagents as per the manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Pipette 100 μL of standards, controls, and plasma samples into
appropriate wells in the prepared microplate.
3. Add 100 μL of assay buffer to each well.
4. Seal the plate and incubate at room temperature for 2 hours
with gentle agitation.
5. Thoroughly wash wells with wash buffer using either a plate
washer or manual pipet.
6. Add 100 μL of the detection antibody to each well.
7. Seal the plate and incubate at room temperature for 1 hour with
gentle agitation.
8. Wash the wells again thoroughly.
9. Add 100 μL of substrate solution to each well.
10. Incubate the plate in the dark at room temperature for 15-30
minutes.
11. Add 50 μL of stop solution to each well.
12. Read the absorbance on a microplate reader at 450 nm (with a
reference wavelength of 540-570 nm if required).
c. Quality Control:
• Include assay controls (provided with the kit) in each run to
monitor assay performance.
• Repeat any out-of-range controls before analyzing patient
samples.
1. DATA ANALYSIS AND REPORTING
Data Analysis:
1. Generate a standard curve by plotting the absorbance of
standards against their concentrations.
2. Determine the concentration of GDF-15 in patient samples by
finding the corresponding values on the standard curve.
3. Utilize appropriate software or manual equation to compute
exact concentrations.
Reporting Results:
• Verify results with quality control data. Any deviations or
anomalies should be rechecked and verified before reporting.
• Document and record results in the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
• Include reference intervals and critical value notations as
appropriate.
• Inform the attending physician or order provider immediately for
any critical values.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Normal reference intervals for GDF-15 levels in plasma should be
validated and approved based on each laboratory’s population
studies and literature references.
1. LIMITATIONS AND INTERFERENCES
• Ensure all samples and reagents are at room temperature before
use.
• Hemolysis, lipemia, and icterus in samples may interfere with
assay accuracy.
• Follow manufacturer’s instructions rigorously to avoid procedural
errors.
1. DOCUMENTATION
Maintain records of:
• Equipment calibration and maintenance.
• Assay performance and quality control results.
• Patient test results and any corrective actions taken.

All laboratory personnel must adhere strictly to this SOP to ensure
the reliability and accuracy of test results. Any deviations or issues
encountered during the analysis must be documented and addressed
immediately in consultation with the laboratory supervisor.
