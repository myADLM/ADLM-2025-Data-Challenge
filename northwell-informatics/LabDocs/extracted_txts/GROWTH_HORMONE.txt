Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Growth Hormone (GH)
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the procedures for the analytical phase of
processing and generating results for Growth Hormone (GH) assays
in a CLIA-certified laboratory. Adherence to this protocol ensures
accuracy and consistency in GH measurement, interpretation, and
reporting.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of trained laboratory personnel to perform all
stages of the GH assay according to this SOP, including necessary
quality control measures and proper result documentation.
1. MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT
• GH assay kit (specific manufacturer details)
• Calibrators and controls (low, medium, high)
• Pipettes (calibrated for accuracy)
• Microplate reader/spectrophotometer
• Bench timer
• Reagent reservoirs
• Disposable pipette tips
• Deionized water
• Absorbent paper
• Laboratory notebook/log
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type:
• Preferred: Serum or plasma (EDTA, heparin)
• Volume: Minimum 1 mL
Specimen Stability:
• Room Temperature: 8 hours
• Refrigerated (2-8°C): 72 hours
• Frozen (-20°C or lower): Long-term storage up to 6 months; avoid
repeated freeze/thaw cycles.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed samples
• Samples with visible contamination
• Specimens collected in inappropriate tubes (e.g., sodium citrate)
1. CALIBRATION AND QUALITY CONTROL
4.1 Calibration:
• Calibrate the microplate reader according to manufacturer
instructions.
• Prepare calibrators according to the assay kit instructions.
• Run calibrators at the beginning of each assay batch.
4.2 Quality Control:
• Include at least two levels of control (low and high) in each run.
• Ensure control results fall within acceptable ranges before
processing patient samples.
• Document QC results; investigate and troubleshoot any out-of-
range controls before proceeding with patient samples.
1. PROCEDURE
5.1 Preparation:
• Set up reagents, controls, and calibrators according to the GH
assay kit instructions.
• Label all tubes and reservoirs accurately.
• Allow all reagents and samples to reach room temperature before
use.
5.2 Assay Protocol:
• Pipette calibrators, controls, and patient samples into assigned
wells on the microplate.
• Add appropriate reagents as indicated by the assay protocol.
• Incubate for the specified time at recommended temperature,
avoiding light if required.
• Wash wells using the specified wash buffer; ensure thorough
removal of all liquid without cross-well contamination.
• Add substrate solution and incubate for the time specified to allow
color development.
• Add stop solution as per the protocol timing.
5.3 Measurement:
• Read the optical density (OD) of the wells using the microplate
reader at the specified wavelength.
• Record the OD values in a laboratory logbook or digital record.
1. CALCULATION AND INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
• Create a standard curve by plotting OD values of the calibrators
against their known GH concentrations.
• Determine patient sample concentrations by comparing their OD
values against the standard curve.
• Ensure all patient results fall into acceptable analytical ranges;
flag any outliers for further review.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Document and verify results in the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
• Include QC and calibration data for verification.
• Report results according to laboratory-specific reporting
guidelines and reference intervals.
Reference Intervals:
• Standard reference intervals for GH levels should be referred to
as defined in the assay kit or established under laboratory
conditions.
1. SAMPLE INTEGRITY AND TROUBLESHOOTING
• Always inspect samples before analysis for integrity issues such
as hemolysis or contamination.
• If sample integrity is in question, centrifuge a small aliquot to
verify and document findings.
• If an unexpected result is obtained, repeat the assay or verify with
a secondary equipment to confirm accuracy.
1. QUALITY ASSURANCE AND RECORD KEEPING
• Maintain detailed records of all calibration, control, and patient
sample results.
• Submit records for periodic internal review to ensure compliance
with laboratory standards.
• Document any deviations or errors in the process, along with
corrective actions taken.
1. REFERENCES
Refer to the specific assay kit product insert and relevant scientific
literature for detailed guidance on GH measurement limitations and
interpretations.
This SOP is effective immediately upon approval and must be
reviewed annually or whenever any changes occur in the assay
methodology or laboratory practice.
