Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) for the Analytical Phase
of Generating Results for Growth Hormone Immunostain,
Technical Component Only
1. Purpose:
To establish a standardized procedure for the immunohistochemical
staining and analysis of the Growth Hormone (GH) in tissue
specimens, ensuring consistent, reliable, and accurate results while
maintaining compliance with CLIA-certified laboratory standards.
2. Scope:
This protocol applies to all qualified laboratory personnel performing
the immunohistochemical (IHC) procedure for Growth Hormone
staining on tissue sections within the laboratory.
3. Definitions and Responsibilities:
• Qualified Personnel: Only laboratory personnel trained and
validated to perform this immunohistochemical procedure are
authorized to carry out these steps.
• Supervisor: Responsible for ensuring the compliance of lab
personnel with this SOP, addressing any discrepancies, and
documenting corrective actions as needed.
4. Materials and Reagents:
• Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections (FFPE)
• Positive control tissue section known to exhibit GH expression
• Primary antibody specific to Growth Hormone
• Secondary antibody conjugated to a detection enzyme (HRP or
AP)
• Chromogenic substrate (DAB or AEC)
• Hematoxylin counterstain
• Xylene and graded alcohols
• Mounting media
• Positive and Negative control slides
5. Equipment:
• Microtome
• Hot air oven
• Water bath
• Staining dishes and racks
• Humidity chamber
• Light microscope
• Automated IHC stainer (optional, if available)
6. Procedure:
A) Tissue Preparation and Sectioning:
1. Sectioning:
◦ Cut 4-5 micrometer sections from FFPE tissue blocks using
a microtome.
◦ Float sections on a warm water bath (40-45°C) and collect
on positively charged slides.
◦ Carefully label the slides with the patient ID, block number,
and date.
2. Drying:
◦ Place slides in a hot air oven at 60°C for 1 hour or at 37°C
overnight to adhere the sections properly to the slides.
B) Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
1. Deparaffinization:
◦ Immerse slides in xylene for 2 changes, 5 minutes each.
2. Rehydration:
◦ Transfer slides through graded alcohols (100%, 95%, 70%,
50%) for 2 minutes each, then rinse in distilled water.
C) Antigen Retrieval:
1. Heat-induced Epitope Retrieval (HIER):
◦ Place slides in a retrieval buffer (e.g., citrate buffer pH 6.0)
and heat in a microwave, steamer, or pressure cooker as
per manufacturer instructions.
◦ Allow slides to cool to room temperature in the buffer, then
rinse in distilled water.
D) Immunostaining:
1. Blocking:
◦ Incubate slides with blocking solution (e.g., 5% serum from
the same host species as secondary antibody) for 20
minutes at room temperature to prevent non-specific
binding.
2. Primary Antibody Incubation:
◦ Apply the Growth Hormone primary antibody to the tissue
sections and incubate in a humidity chamber for the
specified time (usually 1 hour at room temperature or
overnight at 4°C).
3. Washing:
◦ Wash slides in PBS or TBS buffer for 3 changes, 5 minutes
each.
4. Secondary Antibody Incubation:
◦ Apply the enzyme-conjugated secondary antibody and
incubate as per manufacturer's instructions (typically 30
minutes at room temperature).
5. Chromogenic Detection:
◦ Apply the chromogen substrate solution (e.g., DAB) until the
desired intensity develops, typically 5-10 minutes.
6. Counterstaining:
◦ Immerse slides in hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes, rinse in
running tap water, then briefly dip in an acid-alcohol solution
if needed and rinse again.
E) Dehydration and Mounting:
1. Dehydration:
◦ Transfer slides through graded alcohols (70%, 95%, 100%)
and clear in xylene, 2 changes for 2 minutes each.
2. Mounting:
◦ Apply mounting media and cover slips over sections to allow
optical clarity and permanent preservation.
7. Quality Control and Interpretation:
1. Positive Control:
◦ A known GH positive tissue section must be included in
every run to ensure the staining procedure worked correctly.
2. Negative Control:
◦ Use a section without the primary antibody (substitute with
PBS) as a negative control to check for non-specific
staining.
3. Analysis:
◦ Examine the slides under a light microscope for the
presence and intensity of brown chromogen indicating GH
expression.
◦ Document findings, including the presence or absence of
specific staining, localization, and intensity, following
standardized reporting guidelines.
8. Documentation and Reporting:
• Record all QC results, including control slides, in the appropriate
logbook.
• Report results using the laboratory's standardized reporting
format.
• Immediately notify the supervisor of any discrepancies or issues
encountered during the staining process.
9. References:
• Manufacturer's instructions for primary and secondary antibodies.
• Current CLIA regulatory guidelines.
• Laboratory-specific quality assurance policies.
10. Revision History:
• Maintain a log of any updates or revisions to this SOP, including
the date and description of changes.
The above SOP outlines a step-by-step procedure for the analytical
phase of generating Growth Hormone Immunostain results, ensuring
standardized handling and quality adherence across all testing
instances.
