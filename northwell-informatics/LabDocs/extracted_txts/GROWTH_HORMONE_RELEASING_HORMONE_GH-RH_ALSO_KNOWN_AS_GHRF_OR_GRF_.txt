Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Analytical Phase for
Generating Results for Growth Hormone-Releasing Hormone (GH-
RH, also known as GHRF or GRF)
1. PURPOSE
To outline the steps to be followed for the analysis of Growth
Hormone-Releasing Hormone (GH-RH) specimens in order to ensure
accurate, reliable, and reproducible results.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing
GH-RH assays, recording the results accurately, and following the
guidelines outlined in this procedure.
• Supervisors are responsible for reviewing any deviations,
addressing deficiencies, and ensuring compliance with the
procedure.
1. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all specimens submitted for GH-RH testing
within the laboratory. It includes guidelines on specimen
requirements, equipment handling, reagents, QC measures, and
result verification.
1. DEFINITION
Growth Hormone Releasing Hormone (GH-RH) is a hypothalamic
peptide that stimulates the release of growth hormone (GH) from the
anterior pituitary.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type:
• Preferred/acceptable: Serum collected in a red-top tube or a
serum separator tube (SST). Plasma collected in a lavender-top
(EDTA) tube is also acceptable.
• Unacceptable: Hemolyzed samples, samples not maintained at
the appropriate temperature, and samples arriving to the
laboratory beyond the stability period.
Stability and Handling:
• After collection, serum/plasma should be separated from cells
within 2 hours.
• Store specimens at 2-8°C if analysis is expected within 24 hours.
For longer storage, freeze at -20°C or lower.
• Thaw frozen specimens at 2-8°C before testing. Avoid repetitive
freeze-thaw cycles.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• ELISA Reader or Automated Immunoassay Analyzer
• Microcentrifuge
• Pipettes and micropipettes
• Refrigerator and freezer (-20°C or lower)
• Incubator capable of maintaining 37°C
Reagents and Supplies:
• GH-RH ELISA kits or reagents specific to the automated analyzer
• Quality control materials (low, medium, and high concentration
controls)
• Disposable pipette tips
• Gloves and other personal protective equipment (PPE)
• Sample containers and labels
• Deionized or distilled water
• Required calibrators and standards as provided by the assay kit
manufacturer
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation:
1. Review all specimen labels to ensure proper identification.
2. Bring all reagents, samples, and controls to room temperature
(20-25°C) before use.
B. Assay Procedure (General ELISA Method):
1. Prepare reagents and standards as per kit instructions.
2. Add predetermined volume of standards, controls, and samples
to appropriate wells in duplicate.
3. Add assay-specific reagents as instructed, including any
incubation and washing steps.
4. Incubate plates or tubes at the recommended temperature and
duration.
5. Wash wells/tubes according to the kit's instructions using an
automated washer or manually.
6. Add substrate solution, incubate as per the recommended time.
7. Add stop solution and read the plate on an ELISA reader at the
specified wavelength.
*Note: Adhere strictly to the manufacturer's instructions for automated
analyzers.
C. Quality Control:
1. Run quality control samples (low, medium, and high) with each
batch of patient specimens.
2. Review QC results to ensure they fall within acceptable ranges.
Investigate and resolve any out-of-range results.
3. Record QC results according to laboratory protocols.
D. Calculation and Interpretation:
1. Generate a standard curve by plotting the known concentration
of standards against absorbance or signal.
2. Use the standard curve to calculate the GH-RH concentrations
in patient specimens.
3. Verify the final results by cross-checking with duplicate
readings.
4. REPORTING RESULTS
5. Enter results into Laboratory Information System (LIS). Results
should be automatically transmitted if linked to the analytical
instrument.
6. Review and validate generated results to ensure accuracy and
compliance with QC parameters.
7. Any critical or abnormal results should be immediately flagged
and communicated to the clinician as per lab policies.
8. RECORD KEEPING
9. Maintain documentation of all standards, calibrators, controls,
and patient results.
10. Ensure proper logging of temperature checks for storage
equipment.
11. Keep a detailed record of any deviations and corrective actions
taken.
