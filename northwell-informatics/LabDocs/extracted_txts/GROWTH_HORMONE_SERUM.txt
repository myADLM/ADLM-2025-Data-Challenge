Standard Operating Procedure for Analysis of Growth Hormone,
Serum
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for the analysis of Growth Hormone (GH) in
serum samples received in the laboratory to ensure accurate and
timely results.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing and
documenting all steps within this procedure. It is the responsibility of
laboratory supervisors to ensure protocol adherence and take
appropriate corrective actions when necessary.
1. DEFINITION
This protocol pertains to the quantitative analysis of Growth Hormone
(GH) in serum using an automated immunoassay analyzer.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Accepted Specimens:
• Serum collected in a red-top or serum-separator tube (SST).
• Ensure specimen volume is adequate for testing according to
analyzer requirements.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
• Specimens collected in non-approved tubes (e.g., EDTA, citrate).
• Specimens not labeled with patient identification, collection date,
and time.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Automated immunoassay analyzer (specific model and
manufacturer’s details as per laboratory inventory)
• Calibrators and control materials for Growth Hormone
• Growth Hormone reagent kits
• Disposable pipettes
• Calibrated centrifuge
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
1. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Preparation
1. Centrifuge the collected serum specimens at 3000 RPM for 10
minutes to obtain clear serum.
2. If the sample is stored, ensure the serum is at refrigerated
temperature (2-8°C) and is analyzed within 48 hours. For longer
storage, freeze at -20°C.
B. Analyzer Setup and Calibration
1. Turn on the immunoassay analyzer and allow it to go through
its initialization process.
2. Perform routine maintenance checks as per manufacturer’s
instructions.
3. Load the Growth Hormone reagent kit into the analyzer.
4. Run calibrators to calibrate the system as per the
manufacturer’s instructions.
5. Verify calibration by running appropriate quality control (QC)
material.
C. Quality Control
1. Run low and high control materials at the beginning of each
batch, after calibrations, and at regular intervals during testing
according to laboratory quality management guidelines.
2. Record and review QC results. Results must fall within the
predefined acceptable range. If QC fails, do not proceed with
testing until troubleshooting is complete and QC is within the
range.
D. Analysis
1. Load serum specimens into the designated sample racks or
compartments according to the analyzer’s instructions.
2. Enter patient information and specimen identification into the
analyzer’s LIS interface.
3. Initiate the analysis run, ensuring samples are processed in the
order received.
E. Post-Analysis
1. Review results for any flags or errors generated by the
analyzer.
2. Any samples with flagged results must be re-run or reviewed by
the technologist.
3. Record results in the laboratory information system (LIS) and
verify accuracy.
4. REPORTING RESULTS
5. Transmit validated results automatically to the LIS.
6. Any critical results (per laboratory’s critical value policy) must
be immediately communicated to the appropriate healthcare
provider.
7. Follow up on any instances where results do not match clinical
expectations or present anomalies.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the manufacturer's instructions for any method-specific
limitations that could affect the accuracy, specificity, or sensitivity of
the GH assay.

1. REVIEW AND UPDATE OF SOP
This SOP will be reviewed annually or whenever there is a change in
methodology, equipment, or reagent formulation. Any changes will be
documented and approved by the laboratory director or designee.
