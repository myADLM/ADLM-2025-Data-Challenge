Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase:
GUAR GUM, IGE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE To outline the standard operating procedures for the
analysis and reporting of Guar Gum and Immunoglobulin E
(IgE) levels in serum.
Responsibility: The designated staff are responsible for performing
the analysis of Guar Gum and IgE in serum, documenting the results,
and ensuring any deviations or issues are promptly addressed and
reported to a supervisor.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND RECEIPT Specimen Type:
Serum Specimen Volume: Minimum 3 mL of serum per test
Specimen Handling:
• Collect the specimen in a serum separator tube (SST).
• Allow the blood to clot by leaving it undisturbed at room
temperature for at least 30 minutes.
• Centrifuge the SST for 10 minutes at 1,300-1,800 g and promptly
separate the serum.
• Store the serum at 2-8°C if analysis will be performed within 48
hours. For longer storage, freeze serum at -20°C or lower.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Immunoassay Analyzer (e.g., ELISA reader, chemiluminescent
analyzer)
• Reagents specific for Guar Gum and IgE as per manufacturer’s
guidelines
• Micropipettes and tips
• 96-well microtiter plates
• Laboratory centrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Appropriate calibration standards and quality controls for Guar
Gum and IgE
• Serological pipettes
• Sterile serum tubes
1. PROCEDURE
A) GUARD GUM Quantitation Analysis:
1. CALIBRATION & QUALITY CONTROL:
◦ Calibrate the immunoassay analyzer using calibration
standards provided by the manufacturer.
◦ Run appropriate quality controls to ensure accuracy and
precision before proceeding with patient samples.
2. ASSAY PREPARATION:
◦ Assemble all reagents and allow them to come to room
temperature.
◦ Thoroughly mix reagents by gentle inversion or vortexing.
3. SAMPLE PREPARATION:
◦ Dilute the serum sample as required by the assay kit
instructions.
◦ Dispense the required volume of sample and assay
reagents into the microtiter wells as per kit protocol.
4. INCUBATION & SIGNAL GENERATION:
• Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for incubating the samples
with the reagents.
• After incubation, perform any washing steps as directed to
remove unbound substances.
• Add substrate solution and allow the enzyme-substrate reaction to
proceed.
1. READING & REPORTING:
◦ Measure the absorbance using the ELISA reader or
appropriate analyzer.
◦ Compare the absorbance values against the standard curve
to determine Guar Gum concentration.
◦ Verify results and document in the laboratory information
system (LIS).
B) IMMUNOGLOBULIN E (IgE) ANALYSIS:
1. CALIBRATION & QUALITY CONTROL:
◦ Calibrate the analyzer with the provided IgE calibration
standards.
◦ Run internal quality controls to validate assay performance
before analyzing patient specimens.
2. ASSAY PREPARATION:
◦ Set up the assay according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
3. SAMPLE PREPARATION:
◦ Dilute or process the serum samples according to the assay
protocol.
◦ Pipette the samples and necessary reagents into the
assigned wells on the microtiter plate.
4. INCUBATION & DETECTION:
• Follow the specific assay incubation times and temperatures.
• Perform necessary washing steps.
• Add detection reagents and measure the ensuing
chemiluminescent or colorimetric reaction.
1. READING & REPORTING:
◦ Read the results on the chemiluminescent analyzer or
appropriate instrument.
◦ Interpret the readouts to determine serum IgE levels.
◦ Enter results into the LIS for reporting.
2. QUALITY CONTROL:
◦ Include quality control samples in each run to check for
assay reliability.
◦ Quality control samples must fall within acceptable ranges
before reporting patient results.
3. REPORTING RESULTS:
◦ Review and verify results in the LIS before releasing them.
◦ Results must be reviewed by a qualified technologist or
supervisor.
4. REFERENCE INTERVALS:
◦ Guar Gum:
▪ Set as per laboratory protocol and clinical references.
◦ IgE:
▪ Reference range established by the laboratory or as per
specific patient demographics.
5. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
◦ Ensure all procedural steps comply strictly with the
manufacturer’s guidelines to avoid erroneous results.
◦ Identify any potential sample interferences and document
appropriately.
6. DOCUMENTATION AND RECORD KEEPING:
◦ Maintain record logs for all quality controls, calibrations, and
patient results.
◦ Document any deviations, corrective actions, and instrument
maintenance activities.
7. TROUBLESHOOTING:
◦ Refer to the troubleshooting guide provided by the assay
manufacturer for assay-specific issues.
◦ Consult the supervisor for persistent or unresolved issues.
8. REFERENCES:
◦ Assay-specific package inserts and product instructions.
◦ Laboratory QC and validation protocols.
By adhering to the protocol outlined, individuals will ensure the
accurate, reliable, and timely generation of GUAR GUM, IGE,
SERUM results, adhering to laboratory standards and compliance
requirements.
