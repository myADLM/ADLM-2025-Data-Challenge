Standard Operating Procedure GUINEA PIG EPITHELIUM, IGE,
SERUM
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for the analytical phase of generating results
for Guinea Pig Epithelium, IgE in serum. The accurate and timely
analysis of this allergen-specific IgE will provide essential data for
diagnosing and monitoring allergic conditions in patients.
1. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all designated laboratory personnel involved in
processing and analyzing serum samples for Guinea Pig Epithelium,
IgE.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all laboratory personnel to perform the
analysis in accordance with this SOP. Supervisors must ensure that
all staff members are adequately trained and competent in this
procedure. All staff must adhere to quality assurance and quality
control practices as outlined below.
1. PRINCIPLE
This assay quantitatively measures allergen-specific IgE in human
serum using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or
ImmunoCAP technology. The measured concentration indicates
sensitivity to Guinea Pig Epithelium allergens.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/acceptable:
• 1 mL of serum obtained from a properly centrifuged clotted blood
sample using a standard serum-separator tube (SST).
Unacceptable:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
• Samples without proper labeling (including patient identifiers and
collection details).
• Samples that were improperly stored or exceeded stability.
Note: Serum should be stored at 2-8°C if analyzed within 48 hours, or
frozen at -20°C or colder for long-term storage.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• ELISA reader or ImmunoCAP instrument
• Guinea Pig Epithelium-specific IgE assay kit
• Micropipettes and tips
• Vortex mixer
• Incubator (37°C)
• Distilled water
• Calibration standards and controls
• Wash buffer
• Substrate solution
• Stop solution
• Absorbent paper
1. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation
1. Allow serum samples, controls, and standards to reach room
temperature.
2. Thoroughly mix each sample using a vortex mixer.
B. Assay Procedure
1. Follow the specific manufacturer instructions included in the
Guinea Pig Epithelium IgE assay kit.
2. Pipette appropriate volumes of samples, controls, and
standards into designated wells of the microplate.
3. Incubate the microplate at 37°C for the specified time according
to kit instructions.
4. Wash microplate wells using wash buffer according to the kit
instructions.
5. Add the appropriate detection antibody (conjugate) to each
well.
6. Incubate the microplate again at 37°C for the specified time.
7. Perform additional wash steps as indicated in the kit
instructions.
8. Add substrate solution to each well and incubate in the dark for
the recommended time.
9. Add stop solution to halt the reaction.
C. Measurement
1. Measure the absorbance of each well at the specified
wavelength (typically 450 nm) using the ELISA reader or
transfer to an ImmunoCAP instrument for automated reading.
2. Record the absorbance values or results from the instrument.
D. Data Analysis
1. Plot the standard curve using the absorbance values from the
standards.
2. Calculate the IgE concentration for Guinea Pig Epithelium in
each sample using the standard curve.
3. Interpret results against reference intervals or manufacturer-
provided cut-off values.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
5. Run assay controls (both positive and negative) with each
batch of samples to validate accuracy and precision.
6. Ensure the calibration curve has a correlation coefficient (R2) of
at least 0.99.
7. Document and review all quality control data to identify trends
and anomalies.
8. Reassess any suspect results by reevaluation or rerun.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
10. Record the calculated concentration of Guinea Pig Epithelium-
specific IgE for each sample in the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
11. Include the following details in the report:
◦ Patient identification information
◦ Test performed
◦ Guinea Pig Epithelium-specific IgE concentration (in kU/L)
◦ Reference intervals (if applicable)
◦ Date of analysis
◦ Any relevant comments regarding sample integrity or any
anomalies
12. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Interpret results based on manufacturer-supplied reference intervals
or standardized clinical guidelines. Generally, a reference range for
clinical significance should be consulted from the assay product
insert.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the specific assay kit instructions for reagent-specific
limitations. Cross-reactivity with other allergens or interference from
rheumatoid factor and other substances should be considered.
