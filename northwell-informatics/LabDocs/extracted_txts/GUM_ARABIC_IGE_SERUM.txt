Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Generating Results for
Gum Arabic, IgE, and Serum
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the procedures to be followed for the analytical
phase of generating results for Gum Arabic, IgE, and Serum
specimens. The purpose is to ensure accurate and precise
measurements by standardizing the processes used to prepare,
analyze, and document these samples.
Responsibility: The responsibility for adherence to this SOP lies with
all laboratory personnel handling, processing, and analyzing Gum
Arabic, IgE, and Serum specimens.
1. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all clinical laboratories certified under the Clinical
Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) that are responsible for
the analysis of Gum Arabic, Immunoglobulin E (IgE), and Serum.
1. DEFINITION
Gum Arabic: A natural gum made of hardened sap extracted from
different species of the acacia tree, used in various biochemical
applications. IgE: Immunoglobulin E, a class of antibodies associated
with allergic reactions. Serum: The liquid part of blood after
coagulation, devoid of cells and clotting factors. 4. EQUIPMENT,

1. PROCEDURES
A. Sample Preparation
i) Serum Specimen Preparation:
1. Thaw frozen serum specimens at room temperature.
2. Mix gently and aliquot 500 µL into microcentrifuge tubes.

cells or debris.
4. Transfer the clear supernatant to new microcentrifuge tubes for
analysis.
ii) IgE Specimen Preparation:
1. Follow the serum preparation steps as stated above.
2. Dilute serum samples as needed according to the IgE ELISA kit
instructions.
iii) Gum Arabic Specimen Preparation:
1. Weigh 200 mg of Gum Arabic reference standard.
2. Dissolve in 10 mL of deionized water, adjusting pH if necessary.
3. Filter the solution to remove any particulate matter.
B. Analysis of IgE using ELISA:
i) Assay Setup:
1. Follow the manufacturer's instructions in the ELISA kit.
2. Calibrate the ELISA reader according to the kit instructions.
ii) Sample Analysis:
1. Pipette required volumes of standards, controls, and specimens
into designated wells.
2. Add the appropriate volumes of conjugate reagent and
substrate solution as specified.
3. Incubate the plate under recommended conditions.
4. Measure absorbance at the specified wavelength within the
recommended time frame.
iii) Data Collection:
1. Record the optical density (OD) readings.
2. Use standard curve to calculate IgE concentrations in patient
samples.
3. Document the results and QC data in the logbook.
C. Analysis of Serum Proteins:
i) Assay Setup:
1. Prepare standards and controls as per specific protein assay
instruction.
2. Calibrate spectrophotometer accordingly.
ii) Sample Analysis:
1. Pipette standards, controls, and serum specimens into
corresponding cuvettes.
2. Add the specific protein reagent and mix well.
3. Measure and record absorbance at required wavelengths.
iii) Data Collection:
1. Determine protein concentrations using the standard curve.
2. Record all results in the designated logbook.
D. Analysis of Gum Arabic:
i) Assay Setup:
1. Prepare calibration standards for Gum Arabic.
2. Calibrate the pH meter and spectrophotometer.
ii) Sample Analysis:
1. Measure pH of Gum Arabic solution.
2. Perform spectrophotometric analysis to determine
concentration.
3. Follow specific protocols for any additional required tests for
Gum Arabic.
iii) Data Collection:
1. Document pH values and absorbance readings.
2. Calculate the concentration using calibration data.
3. Record all results in the Gum Arabic logbook.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run controls and standards for each batch of specimens
processed.
• Ensure that calibration standards fall within the acceptable range.
• If QC results fall outside the acceptable range, investigate and
troubleshoot the source of error before proceeding.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Enter all results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS) for
review and verification by the technologist.
• Ensure that all QC results and observations are documented.
• Report critical values immediately to the supervising clinical staff
following laboratory policy.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• IgE: Refer to the specific ELISA kit manufacturer’s reference
range.
• Serum Proteins: Specific reference ranges will be provided by the
respective assay kits.
• Gum Arabic: Analytical results will be compared against the
established standard.

1. REVIEW AND REVISION
• This SOP should be reviewed annually or as deemed necessary
by laboratory management.
• Updates or changes to this SOP should be documented, and staff
should be trained accordingly.
This protocol ensures standardized procedures are followed for
generating accurate and precise results for Gum Arabic, IgE, and
Serum, in compliance with CLIA regulations and laboratory practices.
