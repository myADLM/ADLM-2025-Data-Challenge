STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP)
SOP Title: Analytical Phase for Generating Results of GUM
XANTHAN IgE Testing
SOP Number: GUM-XANTHAN-IGE-001
Effective Date: [Insert Date]
Reviewed Date: [Insert Date]
Supersedes: [Insert Date, if applicable]
Prepared by: [Your Name]
Approved by: [Supervisor's Name]
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized protocol for the analytical phase of
generating results for GUM XANTHAN IgE testing in the laboratory.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel involved in the analytical
phase of IgE testing specific to Gum Xanthan. It encompasses the
steps from sample preparation to result interpretation and reporting.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Laboratory Technologists: Perform and document the analysis
of IgE levels in patient samples according to the procedures
outlined in this SOP.
• Supervisors: Ensure the quality control, accuracy, and reliability
of the test results. Address any issues that arise during the
analytical process.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
• Specimen Type: Serum collected in a red cap or SST (Serum
Separator Tube).
• Volume: Minimum of 1 mL of serum.
• Stability:
◦ Room Temperature: 24 hours
◦ Refrigerated (2-8°C): 7 days
◦ Frozen (-20°C): 1 month
• Unacceptable Specimens:
◦ Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric specimens
◦ Specimens with insufficient volume
◦ Specimens in an incorrect collection tube
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• Equipment: Automated immunoassay analyzer (e.g., IMMULITE
2000, Phadia 250)
• Reagents: Gum Xanthan-specific IgE reagent kit
• Supplies:
◦ Calibrated pipettes
◦ Test tubes
◦ Microcentrifuge
◦ PPE (Personal Protective Equipment)
6. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Specimen Identification:
◦ Verify that specimens are correctly labeled with the patient’s
name, date of birth, and collection date/time.
◦ Centrifuge and separate serum from the SST or red cap
tube within 2 hours of collection.
2. Reagent Preparation:
◦ Follow manufacturer instructions to prepare Gum Xanthan-
specific IgE reagents.
◦ Calibrate the immunoassay analyzer according to the
manufacturer’s guidelines.
Analysis:
1. Sample Loading:
◦ Load serum specimens into the designated positions on the
immunoassay analyzer.
◦ Ensure proper coding and positioning of quality control (QC)
samples.
2. Running the Assay:
◦ Initiate the automated assay cycle and monitor the analyzer
for errors or alerts.
◦ Document any deviations or issues observed during the
assay run in the assay log.
3. Quality Control:
◦ Run high and low concentration QC material at the
beginning of each assay cycle.
◦ Evaluate the results against predefined acceptance criteria.
◦ If QC results fail, troubleshoot as per manufacturer
instructions and repeat the QC until acceptable results are
obtained.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Result Verification:
◦ Once the assay cycle is complete, review the generated
results.
◦ Ensure the results for all specimens fall within the expected
range or provide valid explanations for any deviations (e.g.,
comment on possible interference).
2. Documentation:
◦ Enter the validated results into the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
◦ Attach flagged comments for samples that exceed critical
limits, ensuring follow-up with physicians.
3. Reference Intervals:
◦ Normal: ≤ 0.35 kU/L
◦ Elevated: > 0.35 kU/L
8. QUALITY CONTROL
Perform monthly calibration checks and inter-laboratory comparison
procedures as specified in the Quality Control SOP. Maintain logs of
QC performance, instrument maintenance, and calibration records.
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the manufacturer’s product insert for limitations regarding
sensitivity, specificity, and potential interferences of the assay.
• Heterophilic antibodies or RF may bind to immunoglobulins
causing false high/low results.
10. SAFETY AND HANDLING
• Wear appropriate PPE.
• Handle specimens and reagents according to the laboratory’s
biosafety guidelines.
• Dispose of clinical waste as per the established protocols.
