Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Hackberry (Celtis occidentalis) IgE
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to describe the procedure for the
analytical phase in generating results for Hackberry (Celtis
occidentalis) IgE levels. This procedure ensures accurate detection
and quantitation of specific IgE antibodies to Hackberry in patient
samples.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for conducting
assays according to this procedure and for ensuring quality control
measures are in place. All results must be reviewed and verified
before reporting.
1. DEFINITIONS
IgE: Immunoglobulin E, an antibody associated with allergic
reactions. Hackberry (Celtis occidentalis): A tree species, pollen from
which can cause allergic reactions.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred:
• Serum specimen collected in a serum separator tube (SST).
• Minimum volume required: 1 mL serum.
• Specimens should be stored at 2-8°C and are stable for 7 days.
For longer storage, specimens should be frozen at -20°C.
Unacceptable:
• Hemolyzed specimens.
• Specimens collected in EDTA, citrate, or any anticoagulant.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
Equipment:
• Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) reader.
• Microplate washer.
• Pipettes and tips.
Reagents:
• Hackberry (Celtis occidentalis) IgE ELISA kit.
• Calibrators and controls (provided in the kit).
• Washing buffer, substrate solution, stop solution (provided in the
kit).
1. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation:
• Allow serum specimens and controls to reach room temperature
before testing.
• Mix gently before use.
B. Assay Procedure:
1. Prepare all reagents, standards, and samples as instructed in
the ELISA kit insert.
2. Add 100 µL of standards, controls, and samples to the
appropriate wells.
3. Incubate for the specified time at room temperature, as detailed
in the kit insert.
4. Wash the wells according to the kit instructions.
5. Add 100 µL of enzyme conjugate to each well.
6. Incubate for the specified time at room temperature.
7. Wash the wells thoroughly.
8. Add 100 µL of substrate solution to each well.
9. Incubate for the specified time at room temperature, protected
from light.
10. Add 100 µL of stop solution to each well to terminate the
reaction.
11. Read the absorbance at the specified wavelength using the
ELISA reader.
C. Calculating Results:
• Plot the standard curve using the absorbance values of the
calibrators.
• Determine the IgE concentration of the samples from the standard
curve.
• Ensure to include appropriate controls for result validation.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
Quality Control:
• Run internal quality control samples (positive and negative
controls) with each assay to validate results.
• Ensure ELISA kit calibration and controls are within the
acceptable range before processing patient samples.
• Document any deviations from expected control results and take
corrective actions as needed.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
Reporting:
• Review and verify all results by a designated technologist.
• Generate patient reports with Hackberry (Celtis occidentalis) IgE
results.
• Critical results must be immediately communicated to the
physician or clinic.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Reference intervals should be based on kits’ provided reference
ranges and site-specific validated ranges:
• Normal: <0.35 IU/mL
• Elevated: ≥0.35 IU/mL
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the ELISA kit insert for specific limitations of the assay.
1. REFERENCES
• Hackberry (Celtis occidentalis) IgE ELISA kit insert.
1. DOCUMENTATION
• Ensure all steps are documented in the appropriate laboratory
logbooks.
• Maintain records for quality control, including calibrator and
control results, instrument maintenance logs, and patient result
reports.
