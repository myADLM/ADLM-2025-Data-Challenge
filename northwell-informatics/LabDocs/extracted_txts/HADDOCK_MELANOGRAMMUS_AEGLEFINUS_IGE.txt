Title: Analytical Phase Protocol for Generating Results for Haddock
(Melanogrammus aeglefinus) IgE
1. PURPOSE This document provides the standardized
procedures for the analytical phase of generating results for
Haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus) IgE in a CLIA-certified
laboratory. Accurate and reliable measurement of IgE specific to
Haddock is essential for diagnostic evaluation and patient
management.
Responsibility: Designated staff are responsible for performing IgE
assays according to this SOP and ensuring the integrity and reliability
of test results.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
◦ Preferred Specimen: Serum or plasma collected in a gold-
top (SST) or green-top (heparin) vacutainer.
◦ Volume: Minimum of 0.5 mL.
◦ Stability: Specimens should be stored at 2-8°C if not
immediately processed and are stable for up to 7 days. For
long-term storage, specimens may be frozen at -20°C or
lower.
2. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
◦ IgE Quantitative Assay Kit, specific for Haddock
(Melanogrammus aeglefinus)
◦ Calibrators and controls specific to the assay kit
◦ Microplate reader capable of detecting absorbance at
proper wavelength (typically 450 nm)
◦ Incubators set at the assay-specific temperatures
◦ Wash buffer and pipettes for precision liquid handling
◦ Plate sealers and microplates
3. PROCEDURES
A. Preparation: - Retrieve specimens from storage and allow them to
reach room temperature. - Assemble all necessary reagents and
calibrators, ensuring they are within expiry dates. - Label the
microplates with appropriate identification tags.
B. Assay Setup: - Pipette 100 µL of calibrators, controls, and samples
into designated wells of the microplate. - Add 100 µL of enzyme
conjugate or detection antibody as per assay protocol. - Seal the
plate and incubate at specified temperature and time according to the
assay guidelines. - Wash the plate thoroughly to remove unbound
substances using the wash buffer.
C. Detection: - Add the substrate solution to each well and incubate
for the recommended time. - Stop the reaction with the appropriate
stop solution. - Measure the absorbance at 450 nm using a
microplate reader.
D. Data Analysis: - Generate standard curves from the calibrator
absorbance readings. - Calculate the concentration of Haddock IgE
in each specimen by comparing sample absorbance to the standard
curve using analytical software. - Review and validate results for
accuracy and consistency.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Run at least two levels of controls (positive and negative)
with each batch of assays.
◦ Ensure control results are within the established range
before reporting patient results. If controls are out of range,
troubleshoot and repeat the assay.
◦ Record all control results, specimen results, incubation
times, temperatures, and any deviations in the quality
control log.
2. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ Transmit results electronically to the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
◦ Review all results for compliance with QC standards before
verification.
◦ Flag any critical values (as defined by the laboratory's
clinical guidelines) for immediate reporting to the relevant
healthcare providers.

4. METHOD LIMITATIONS
◦ Ensure to review the Haddock IgE Assay Kit insert for any
limitations specific to the reagents used in the assay.
◦ Limitations may include cross-reactivity with other IgE
species or interference from hemolyzed samples.
5. REVISIONS
◦ Any updates in protocol or changes in the analytical
procedures will be documented in the laboratory's SOP
revision log and approved by the laboratory director.
