Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase:
HAEMOPHILUS INFLUENZAE TYPE B ANTIBODY, IGG, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for the analytical phase of generating results
for Haemophilus influenzae type B antibody, IgG, serum in a CLIA-
certified laboratory, ensuring accuracy, precision, and compliance
with regulatory standards.
Responsibility:
• The designated laboratory personnel are responsible for
performing and documenting the analysis of Haemophilus
influenzae type B antibody, IgG, serum as specified in this
procedure.
• The laboratory supervisor is responsible for ensuring that
personnel are adequately trained and that the SOP is followed
correctly.
1. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel performing the
Haemophilus influenzae type B antibody, IgG test on serum
specimens.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• ELISA reader (microplate reader) calibrated and validated.
• Automated or semi-automated ELISA washer.
• Pipettes (single and multi-channel) calibrated and validated.
• Centrifuge.
Reagents:
• Haemophilus influenzae type B IgG ELISA kit.
• Calibrators and controls provided by the kit or validated external
controls.
• Deionized or distilled water.
Supplies:
• Serum sample tubes.
• Microcentrifuge tubes.
• Microplates (provided in the ELISA kit).
• Disposable pipette tips.
• Disposable gloves and other personal protective equipment
(PPE).
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Serum.
• Volume Required: Minimum 0.5 mL of serum.
• Storage: Serum specimens can be stored at 2-8°C for up to 7
days. For long-term storage, specimens should be frozen at -20°C
or below.
• Unacceptable Specimens: Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric
specimens, or specimens subjected to repeated freeze-thaw
cycles.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation:
1. Bring all reagents, calibrators, controls, and specimens to room
temperature (20-25°C) before use.
2. Label the microplate with the appropriate identifiers for
calibrators, controls, and patient samples.
B. Assay Procedure:
1. Using a micropipette, dispense the required volume (as per kit
instructions) of each calibrator, control, and patient sample into
the designated wells of the microplate.
2. Add the specified volume of enzyme conjugate to each well.
3. Incubate the plate at room temperature for the period specified
by the kit manufacturer.
4. Following the incubation, wash the plate using the ELISA
washer according to the kit instructions' specified wash cycles.
5. Add the substrate solution to each well and incubate for the
specified time in the kit instructions, avoiding direct light.
6. Add the stop solution to each well to halt the enzymatic
reaction.
C. Reading and Interpretation:
1. Read the optical density (OD) of each well at the wavelength
specified by the kit (typically 450 nm) using the ELISA reader.
2. Calculate the concentration of Haemophilus influenzae type B
IgG in patient samples using the calibration curve generated
from the OD readings of the calibrators.
3. Record the results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
4. QUALITY CONTROL
5. Run internal controls (positive and negative) with each batch of
tests to ensure assay validity.
6. Verify that control results fall within the established ranges
before interpreting patient results.
7. Document and investigate any out-of-control results according
to the laboratory’s quality control procedures.
8. RESULT REPORTING
9. Review and validate results in the LIS.
10. Ensure that results are within the reportable range. If results are
outside of reportable range, appropriate dilution should be
performed and re-assayed.
11. Report critical results immediately to the requesting clinician
according to the laboratory’s critical results protocol.

1. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If unexpected results or assay failures occur, refer to the
troubleshooting guide in the manufacturer's kit insert.
• Document any deviations and corrective actions taken.
1. DOCUMENTATION
• Record all reagent lot numbers, expiration dates, and quality
control results.
• Ensure all steps are documented in the appropriate logs and the
LIS as required by laboratory protocols.
By following this SOP, the laboratory ensures the accuracy, reliability,
and reproducibility of results for Haemophilus influenzae type B
antibody, IgG, serum testing.
