Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for HAKE, FISH, IGE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this protocol is to outline the analytical procedures for
generating laboratory results for HAKE (Hereditary Angioedema
Kallikrein-Elisa), FISH (Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization), IGE
(Immunoglobulin E), and SERUM tests. This SOP ensures accuracy,
reliability, and efficiency in performing these analyses.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the
analytical procedures as described in this SOP. It is the responsibility
of all staff to adhere to the protocol and notify the supervisor of any
deviations, problems, or concerns that may affect test results.
1. DEFINITION
HAKE: A specific ELISA test used to measure levels of kallikrein in
patients with Hereditary Angioedema. FISH: A cytogenetic technique
used to detect and localize the presence or absence of specific DNA
sequences on chromosomes. IGE: A test measuring levels of
Immunoglobulin E antibodies, commonly used to diagnose allergic
conditions. SERUM: A general test involving the analysis of serum,
often for various biochemical or immunological markers.
1. PROCEDURE
A) HAKE (Hereditary Angioedema Kallikrein-Elisa)
1. Ensure all reagents and standards are at room temperature.
2. Pipette calibrators, samples, and controls into the wells of the
ELISA plate.
3. Add the enzyme conjugate to each well and incubate for the
time specified in the kit.
4. Wash the wells according to the kit instructions.
5. Add substrate solution and incubate for the recommended time.
6. Measure the absorbance at the specified wavelength using a
microplate reader.
7. Record the results and interpret according to the standard
curve.
B) FISH (Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization)
1. Prepare slides with the specimen according to the specific FISH
protocol.
2. Denature the DNA in the specimens and hybridize with the
specific fluorescently labeled probes.
3. Wash the slides to remove non-specific binding.
4. Counterstain the slides with DAPI or other appropriate stain.
5. Visualize under a fluorescence microscope and capture
images.
6. Analyze using specific software to interpret the presence or
absence of targeted sequences.
7. Record the results and report.
C) IGE (Immunoglobulin E)
1. Set up the assay according to the instructions of the
commercial kit.
2. Pipette patient specimens, controls, and standards into the
wells.
3. Incubate with antibodies specific for human IgE.
4. Wash and add enzyme-labeled secondary antibodies.
5. Add substrate and incubate for the recommended time.
6. Measure the colorimetric changes using a microplate reader.
7. Calculate IgE concentration based on the standard curve and
record results.
D) SERUM (General Biochemical/Immunological Analysis)
1. Separate serum from blood samples using centrifugation
(typically at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes).
2. Perform specific assays according to the test being carried out
(e.g., enzyme activity, protein concentration).
3. Use automated analyzers or manual methods as required.
4. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for each specific test.
5. Record data and ensure all quality control measures are met.
Quality Control:
1. Run appropriate controls and standards along with patient
samples.
2. Verify calibration of equipment before use.
3. Document all QC results and ensure they fall within acceptable
ranges.
4. Perform corrective actions as needed if QC results are outside
acceptable limits.
Reporting Results:
1. Results must be reviewed and verified by the technologist.
2. Ensure that all critical values are flagged and reported
according to the laboratory's protocol.
3. Enter results into the LIS (Laboratory Information System) for
final reporting.
4. Address any sample integrity issues as necessary before
finalizing reports.
References:
All references and manufacturer’s instructions applicable to the kits
and instruments used must be reviewed and followed. Consult
specific product inserts and the laboratory’s procedure manuals for
detailed guidance on each test.
Note: This protocol is designed to provide a general guide for HAKE,
FISH, IGE, and SERUM tests. Please adapt and follow site-specific
guidelines as necessary. Consult the relevant procedure manuals
and product instructions for specific requirements and deviations.
