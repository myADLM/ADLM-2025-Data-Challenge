Standard Operating Procedure for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for HALIBUT IGE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to provide a detailed procedure for the
analytical phase of generating results for HALIBUT IGE, SERUM
testing in the laboratory. This procedure ensures consistent,
accurate, and reliable results and adheres to CLIA guidelines.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all trained laboratory personnel to follow this
SOP precisely. Each step should be accurately documented, and any
deviations should be immediately reported to a supervisor.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type: Serum Volume: Minimum volume required is 1 mL
Specimen Collection: Blood samples should be collected in serum
separator tubes (SST) or plain red top tubes. Ensure proper
venipuncture techniques to avoid hemolysis. Specimen Storage: If
not analyzed immediately, store the serum at 2-8°C for up to 48
hours. For longer storage, freeze at -20°C or lower. Unacceptable
Specimens: Specimens that are hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric will
affect the accuracy of the results and should be rejected.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
Equipment:
• Automated Immunoassay Analyzer (specific model to be used:
e.g., ImmunoChem ID-300)
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes and tips
• Refrigerator and freezer
Reagents:
• HALIBUT IGE Calibrators
• HALIBUT IGE Controls
• HALIBUT IGE Specific Reagent Kits (including antigen-coated
wells/enzyme conjugates/substrate)
1. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation:
1. Verify all reagents and controls have not expired and are stored
according to the manufacturer’s specifications.
2. Allow reagents, controls, and patient specimens to reach room
temperature before starting the assay.
B) Calibration:
1. Calibrate the immunoassay analyzer using HALIBUT IGE
Calibrators according to the manufacturer's guidelines.
2. Perform calibration verification to ensure the accuracy of the
instrument response.
C) Quality Control:
1. Run HALIBUT IGE positive and negative controls at the
beginning of each batch run.
2. Document all control results on the Quality Control log.
3. If controls are out of acceptable range, troubleshoot according
to troubleshooting guidelines in the analyzer’s manual. Do not
proceed until controls are within acceptable limits.
D) Testing:
1. Centrifuge the serum samples at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes to
separate serum from clot.
2. Carefully transfer serum to labelled sample cups avoiding
contamination.
3. Load the samples into the immunoassay analyzer following the
manufacturer’s protocol.
4. Start the run using the predefined HALIBUT IGE method on the
analyzer.
5. The analyzer will automatically process the samples and
provide results.
E) Interpretation of Results:
1. Results are automatically transmitted to the Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
2. Review the results for consistency with quality control data and
calibrator responses.
3. Verify and validate the results following site-specific guidelines.
4. RESULTS REPORTING
• Results should be reviewed and verified by the technologist.
• Report results in mg/L or IU/mL depending on assay
specifications.
• Critical values should be communicated immediately to the
requesting physician and documented as per laboratory policy.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Refer to manufacturer’s package insert or laboratory-established
reference intervals for HALIBUT IGE levels.
• Normal reference values may vary based on demographics;
consider age and specific reference ranges established by the
laboratory.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to HALIBUT IGE Reagent Kit insert for detailed information
on the limitations of the test, including possible cross-reactivity
and interference factors.
• Ensure specimen integrity to avoid erroneous results.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Internal quality control should include running standardized
control material per batch.
• External proficiency testing programs should be participated in
periodically to ensure accuracy.
• All quality control data should be documented and reviewed
regularly.
