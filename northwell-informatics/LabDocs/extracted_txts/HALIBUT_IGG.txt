Standard Operating Procedures: Protocol for HALIBUT IGG
Testing
1. Purpose
The purpose of this procedure is to outline the standardized method
for conducting HALIBUT IGG testing in the laboratory for the
determination of halibut-specific Immunoglobulin G antibodies in
patient samples. This SOP ensures consistency, reliability, and
accuracy of results.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of the trained laboratory personnel to follow this
procedure accurately and document all necessary information.
Supervisors are responsible for training personnel, verifying results,
and ensuring compliance with the SOP.
2. Specimen Requirements
Preferred Specimen:
• Serum: 5 mL collected in a red-top or serum gel tube.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens that are hemolyzed, lipemic, or contaminated.
• Specimens not stored properly or beyond stability limits (see
below).
Transport and Stability:
• Specimens should be stored at 2-8°C and tested within 72 hours
of collection.
• If not tested within 72 hours, specimens can be frozen at -20°C
for up to 3 months but should not undergo repeated freeze-thaw
cycles.
3. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies
• HALIBUT IGG ELISA kit (specific manufacturer)
• Microplate reader
• Calibrated pipettes and tips
• Vortex mixer
• Plate washer
• Incubator set to 37°C
• Serum separator tubes
• Disposable gloves and lab coat
4. Procedure
A. Sample Preparation:
1. Allow serum specimens to come to room temperature.
2. If necessary, centrifuge specimens at 1500 x g for 10 minutes to
separate serum.
3. Label the specimens and transfer appropriate volumes into
clean, labeled microtubes.
B. ELISA Test Setup:
1. Bring all reagents and samples to room temperature.
2. Prepare reagents and working solutions as specified by the
manufacturer’s instructions.
3. Load samples, standards, and controls into the designated
wells of the ELISA plate.
◦ Add 100 µL of test serum or standards to each well.
4. Incubate the plate at 37°C for 1 hour.
C. Washing Procedure:
1. Aspirate the contents of each well.
2. Wash the wells three times with the provided washing buffer,
ensuring complete removal each time.
D. Addition of Secondary Reagent:
1. Add 100 µL of enzyme-conjugated secondary antibody to each
well.
2. Incubate the plate at 37°C for another 1 hour.
E. Substrate Addition:
1. Aspirate and wash the wells again as described.
2. Add 100 µL of the substrate solution to each well.
3. Incubate in the dark at room temperature for 20-30 minutes or
until desired color intensity is observed.
F. Stop Reaction:
1. Add 50 µL of stop solution to each well to halt the reaction.
G. Reading the Plate:
1. Measure absorbance at 450 nm using a microplate reader
within 15 minutes of adding the stop solution.
2. Record results for interpretation.
5. Quality Control
1. Run positive and negative controls with each assay.
2. Verify that control results are within the acceptable range as
provided by the kit manufacturer.
3. If quality control results fall outside the accepted range, perform
troubleshooting steps and redo the assay if necessary.
6. Calculation and Reporting of Results
1. Results are calculated based on standard curves created using
known concentrations of HALIBUT IGG.
2. Verify that the sample readings fall within the linear range of the
assay.
3. Report results according to site-specific guidelines.
Reference Intervals:
• HALIBUT IGG concentration: Normal range depends on the
reference provided by the manufacturer or established in-house
validation studies.
7. Method Limitations
• Presence of interfering substances (e.g., rheumatoid factor or
heterophile antibodies) may affect assay results.
• Ensure that sample integrity is maintained throughout the
process.
8. Documentation and Record Keeping
1. Record all sample information, including patient details,
collection time, storage conditions, and testing results.
2. Maintain copies of all automated and manual records for
traceability.
3. Ensure that all procedures and results are documented in the
laboratory information system.
