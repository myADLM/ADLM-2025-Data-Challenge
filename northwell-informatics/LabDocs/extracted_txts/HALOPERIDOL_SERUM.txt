Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Haloperidol, Serum
1. PURPOSE
To provide accurate and reliable measurement of haloperidol
concentration in serum specimens. The procedure details the steps
to be followed for the handling, preparation, and analysis of serum
samples to ensure consistent and reproducible results.
Responsibility:
• It is the responsibility of the laboratory technologists to perform
the sample preparation, analysis, and result reporting as per the
procedure.
• The supervisor's duty is to ensure compliance with the SOP and
address any analytical issues.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Accepted Specimen Type: Serum
• Collection Tubes: Use a red-top or serum separator tube (SST).
• Volume Required: A minimum of 1 mL of serum.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens collected in tubes containing anticoagulants (e.g.,
EDTA, heparin, citrate).
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
• Underfilled specimens that do not meet the minimum volume
requirement.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) system with a
UV detector
• Analytical balance
• Volumetric flasks
• Pipettes and tips
• Glass vials with screw caps
• Centrifuge
• HPLC-grade methanol, acetonitrile, and water
• Haloperidol standard (certified reference material)
• Mobile phase: Water (HPLC grade) and acetonitrile in a specified
ratio
• Internal standard solution (if applicable)
• Calibration standards and quality control samples
• Protective lab equipment (gloves, lab coat, safety glasses)
1. CALIBRATION AND QUALITY CONTROL
• Calibration:
◦ Prepare calibration standards from the certified reference
material by serial dilution using HPLC-grade solvents.
◦ Establish a calibration curve by running standards of known
concentrations.
◦ The calibration curve must include at least five different
concentrations, including the lower limit of quantification (LLQ)
and upper limit of quantification (ULQ).
◦ Run a calibration curve with each batch of patient samples.
• Quality Control:
◦ Use two levels of quality control (QC) samples (low, medium,
and high concentrations) prepared in the same matrix as the
patient samples.
◦ QC samples should be analyzed with each batch of samples.
◦ Results should be within ±15% of the expected value to accept
the run.
1. PROCEDURE
Sample Preparation: - Allow serum samples to clot completely and
centrifuge at 1500 x g for 10 minutes. - Transfer 1 mL of clear serum
to a clean glass vial.
Extraction Procedure: - Add an appropriate volume of internal
standard (if used) to each sample. - Protein precipitation method: -
Add 2 volumes of cold acetonitrile to the serum sample. - Vortex mix
for 1 minute. - Centrifuge at 3000 x g for 10 minutes. - Transfer the
clear supernatant to an HPLC vial. - Alternatively, a solid-phase
extraction (SPE) may be used according to manufacturer's
instructions.
HPLC Analysis: - Set up the HPLC following the manufacturer’s
instructions. - Mobile phase: Prepare a mixture of water and
acetonitrile (specified ratio). - Column: Use a C18 reverse-phase
column or equivalent. - Injection Volume: 20 µL (adjust as
necessary). - Detection: Set the UV detector at 245 nm for
haloperidol. - Run time: Approximate run time of 10 minutes per
sample.
- Inject the calibration standards, QC samples, and patient samples.
- Ensure baseline stability and peak resolution.
- Identify and quantify haloperidol by comparing sample peaks to calibration standards.
Reporting Results: - Calculate the concentration of haloperidol in
patient samples using the calibration curve. - QC results must be
within acceptable limits before reporting patient results. - Enter
results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS) and verify.
Sample Integrity: - Samples with significant hemolysis or those which
produce unreliable results require recollection.
1. REFERENCE INTERVAL
• Therapeutic Range: 5-15 ng/mL (may vary based on individual lab
or clinical guidelines).
• Toxic Range: >20 ng/mL (consult clinician if levels exceed
therapeutic range).
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• This procedure may not be suitable for samples with extreme
hemolysis, lipemia, or icterus.
• Interference from other drugs or metabolites should be
considered.
