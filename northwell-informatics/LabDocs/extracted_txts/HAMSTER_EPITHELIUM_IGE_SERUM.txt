Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for HAMSTER
EPITHELIUM, IGE, SERUM Analysis
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for the analysis of Hamster Epithelium-
specific IgE in serum specimens to ensure accurate and timely
results. This protocol will aid in the diagnosis of allergic responses to
hamster epithelium.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for following this
procedure to analyze, document, and report test results accurately.
1. DEFINITION
Hamster Epithelium IgE is an assay used to detect the presence of
specific immunoglobulin E antibodies in serum which indicates an
allergic response to hamster epithelium.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• Automated Immunoassay Analyzer (e.g., Phadia ImmunoCAP
System)
• Calibrators and Controls specific for Hamster Epithelium IgE
• Hamster Epithelium IgE assay kits
• Pipettes and tips
• Specimen tubes
• Serum specimen (collected and processed as per standard
protocols)
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
1. PROCEDURE
Specimen Handling:
1. Ensure serum specimens have been properly collected,
labeled, and stored prior to analysis.
2. Acceptable specimens: Serum collected in standard SST tubes
stored at 2-8°C for up to 7 days or frozen at -20°C for longer
storage.
3. Unacceptable specimens: Hemolyzed, lipemic, or improperly
labeled specimens.
Preparation:
1. Wear appropriate PPE (lab coat, gloves, and eye protection).
2. Bring serum specimens and reagents to room temperature.
3. Calibrate the immunoassay analyzer according to the
manufacturer’s instructions using specific calibrators for
Hamster Epithelium IgE.
4. Perform required QC checks using low and high controls.
Assay Procedure:
1. Load the serum specimens into the designated positions on the
immunoassay analyzer.
2. Set up the analyzer with appropriate assay parameters from the
kit insert.
3. Initiate the IgE assay run: a. Add reagents, serum, and
standards as per kit instructions. b. Ensure there is no cross-
contamination between samples.
4. Allow the analyzer to complete the assay run according to
manufacturer’s instructions.
Analyzing Data:
1. Review initial results produced by the immunoassay analyzer.
2. Confirm the acceptance of quality control data and assure the
validity of calibration.
3. Verify that all specimen results fall within the dynamic range of
the assay.
Reporting Results:
1. Document all results in the LIS (Laboratory Information
System).
2. Report results which are:
◦ Less than 0.35 kU/L – Negative for Hamster Epithelium-
specific IgE
◦ 0.35 kU/L or higher – Positive for Hamster Epithelium-
specific IgE
3. Any results that show inconsistency or require rerun should be
handled according to laboratory protocols (repeat analysis or
notify the supervisor if necessary).
4. QUALITY CONTROL
Validation Checks:
1. Internal quality control samples must be run with each batch
and documented.
2. If QC fails, investigate, and correct before reporting patient
results.
External Quality Control:
Participate in external proficiency testing programs to ensure assay
accuracy.
Maintenance:
1. Routine maintenance of the immunoassay analyzer should be
performed according to manufacturer instructions.
2. Calibration and control records should be maintained for review
and audits.

Note: This protocol must be reviewed regularly and updated in
accordance with current regulatory standards and manufacturer
updates. Any deviations or incidents must be documented and
reviewed to ensure quality and accuracy in diagnostic testing.
