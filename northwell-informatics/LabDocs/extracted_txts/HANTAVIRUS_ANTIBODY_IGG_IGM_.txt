Protocol for Analytical Phase of HANTAVIRUS ANTIBODY (IGG,
IGM) Testing
1. Principle and Purpose The purpose of this protocol is to
provide accurate and reliable test results for Hantavirus
Antibody (IgG, IgM) using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay (ELISA) or other approved methodologies. Detecting
these antibodies is crucial for diagnosing Hantavirus infections
in patients presenting clinical symptoms.
2. Specimen Requirements
◦ Preferred Specimen: Serum or plasma collected in SST
(serum separator tube) or EDTA tube.
◦ Acceptable Specimen: Serum or plasma collected in plain
red top tube.
◦ Unacceptable Specimen: Hemolyzed samples, grossly
lipemic samples, or samples collected in non-specified
tubes.
3. Equipment, Reagents and Supplies
◦ ELISA kit for Hantavirus Antibody (IgG, IgM) testing (ensure
all reagents are within their expiration date).
◦ Microplate reader capable of reading at appropriate
wavelength(s) (typically 450 nm).
◦ Pipettes and tips.
◦ Incubator set at appropriate temperature, as specified by the
kit's instructions.
◦ Distilled or deionized water.
◦ Laboratory timer.
◦ eppendorf tubes or wells (as applicable)
◦ Washing buffer, substrate solution, stop solution (provided in
ELISA kit).
4. Procedure
◦ Preparation:
1. Ensure all reagents and samples are at room
temperature.
2. Prepare all necessary materials and equipment as per
the kit’s instructions.
◦ Assay Setup:
1. Sample preparation:
▪ Centrifuge the blood samples to obtain serum or
plasma.
▪ Transfer serum or plasma into eppendorf tubes.
▪ Dilute the samples according to the kit’s
instructions (usually 1:100 for IgG and 1:20 for IgM
if specified).
2. Adding controls and samples:
▪ Add appropriate controls (positive and negative) in
duplicate wells.
▪ Pipette diluted samples into assigned wells as per
the plate layout plan.
3. Incubation:
▪ Incubate the plate at the specified temperature for
the specified time (usually 37ºC for 30-60 minutes).
4. Washing:
▪ Wash the plate 3-5 times using the washing buffer
provided, ensuring complete removal of wash
buffer between cycles.
5. Addition of conjugate (antibody enzyme
conjugate):
▪ Add the conjugate to each well according to kit
instructions and incubate for the specified time.
6. Substrate Reaction:
▪ Add the substrate solution to each well and
incubate in the dark for the appropriate duration.
7. Stopping Reaction:
▪ Add stop solution to each well.
8. Reading the Plate:
▪ Insert the plate into the microplate reader to
measure absorbance at 450 nm.
5. Quality Control
◦ Always run positive and negative controls with each batch of
tests to ensure the assay's accuracy.
◦ Ensure calibration of the microplate reader and other
analytical equipment as per manufacturer guidelines.
◦ Any discrepancies in control results must be addressed
immediately, with potential recalibration or re-running of the
assay as necessary.
6. Calculations
◦ Calculate the absorbance value using the formula specified
in the ELISA kit.
◦ Compare patient sample absorbance values against control
values to determine positivity or negativity.
7. Reporting Results
◦ Results will be reviewed and validated by the technologist.
◦ Positive results should be reported as "positive for
Hantavirus IgG or IgM antibodies".
◦ Negative results should be reported as "negative for
Hantavirus IgG or IgM antibodies".
◦ Equivocal results should be reviewed, and further testing
should be considered.
8. Reference Intervals
◦ As provided in the kit instructions.
9. Method Limitations
◦ Cross-reactivity with other viruses may result in a false
positive. Other confirmatory tests may be required.
◦ Incorrect handling or preparation of specimens may result in
false negative or false positive results.
10. Equipment Maintenance and Verification
• Ensure regular maintenance and calibration of the microplate
reader and other analytical equipment.
• Document maintenance activities according to laboratory
protocols.
