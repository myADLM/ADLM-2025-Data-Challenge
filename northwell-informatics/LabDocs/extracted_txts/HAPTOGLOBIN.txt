Standard Operating Procedure: Haptoglobin Analysis
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for the measurement and reporting of
haptoglobin levels in blood samples. This procedure ensures
accurate and timely results for diagnostic and monitoring purposes.
Responsibility:
All trained laboratory personnel are responsible for performing the
procedures as outlined. It is critical that the staff adhere to the
guidelines to maintain the integrity and accuracy of the results.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type:
• Acceptable: Serum or Plasma (collected using a lithium heparin or
EDTA anticoagulant)
• Volume: Minimum of 0.5 mL of serum or plasma is required.
Specimen Stability:
• Serum/Plasma can be stored at 2-8°C for up to 7 days.
• For long-term storage, samples should be frozen at -20°C or
lower.
• Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed samples.
• Specimens that are not properly labeled.
• Samples that are not within the specified stability period.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Automated Chemistry Analyzer (e.g., Roche Cobas, Beckman AU
series)
• Calibrated micropipettes
• Centrifuge
Reagents:
• Haptoglobin assay reagent kit, compatible with the selected
analyzer (Ensure it is within the expiration date and stored as per
the manufacturer's instructions)
• Quality control materials (Level 1 and Level 2)
• Calibrators for haptoglobin
4. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Verify that all reagents and quality control materials are within
their expiration dates.
2. Ensure that the analyzer is calibrated as per the manufacturer’s
guidelines.
Specimen Processing:
1. Centrifuge blood samples at 1500-2000g for 10 minutes to
obtain serum or plasma.
2. Transfer the supernatant into clean, appropriately labeled
tubes.
Analysis:
1. Load samples, quality controls, and calibrators onto the
chemistry analyzer according to the analyzer’s operating
instructions.
2. Select the haptoglobin assay from the analyzer’s test menu.
3. Start the analysis process.
Quality Control:
1. Perform quality control assays with each run of patient
samples.
2. Ensure that QC results fall within the acceptable ranges. If QC
fails, investigate and resolve the issue before testing patient
samples.
3. Document all QC results and any corrective actions taken.
5. RESULTS REPORTING
1. Review all patient results for consistency and correlation with
QC values.
2. Report any critical values immediately to the responsible
healthcare provider.
3. Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS) for
verification and final report generation.
4. Verify by a qualified technologist before results are sent to the
referring physician or healthcare provider.
Reference Intervals:
• Adult Reference Range: 0.30 – 2.00 g/L (May vary by specific
laboratory and method used; verify with the manufacturer's kit
insert for precise reference intervals)
6. QUALITY CONTROL
Material:
• Two levels of quality control material (normal and abnormal)
Procedure:
1. Run quality controls at the beginning of each shift, after
maintenance, with every new lot number, and when
troubleshooting.
2. Document QC results in the QC log.
3. Investigate and correct any QC outliers before proceeding with
patient testing.
7. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolysis can interfere with haptoglobin results, leading to falsely
low readings.
• Use manufacturer’s instructions for limitations related to specific
reagents and analyzers.
8. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s reagent and analyzer instruction manuals.
• Laboratory quality control policies and procedures.
By following this SOP, accurate and reliable haptoglobin results can
be generated, ensuring the validity of patient results for clinical
decision-making.
