Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase -
Haptoglobin, Serum
1. PURPOSE
To provide a detailed and standardized procedure for the analytical
phase of determining Haptoglobin levels in serum specimens. The
accurate and precise measurement of Haptoglobin is essential for
diagnosing and monitoring hemolytic anemia and other related
conditions.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all qualified laboratory technologists to
adhere to this SOP. Laboratory supervisors must ensure compliance
and address any discrepancies or issues as they arise.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Equipment:
◦ Chemistry Analyzer (approved models include Siemens
Atellica CH, Roche Cobas, Beckman Coulter AU)
◦ Traceable thermometer
◦ Centrifuge
• Reagents:
◦ Haptoglobin Reagent Kit (specific to the analyzer being used)
◦ Quality Control materials (Low and High controls)
◦ Calibrators
• Supplies:
◦ Serum separator tubes (SST)
◦ Pipettes and tips
◦ Calibrated refrigerator and freezer for reagent storage
◦ Gloves, lab coats, PPE
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND HANDLING
• Specimen Type:
◦ Serum collected in SST
• Specimen Stability and Storage:
◦ Specimens may be stored at 2-8°C for up to 48 hours. For
longer storage, freeze at -20°C or lower.
◦ Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
• Unacceptable Specimens:
◦ Hemolyzed samples
◦ Grossly lipemic or icteric specimens
5. CALIBRATION AND QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform calibration as per manufacturer's instructions using the
appropriate Haptoglobin calibrators.
• Run quality control (QC) samples at the beginning of each day,
after calibration, and with each new reagent lot. Document QC
results and ensure they fall within the acceptable range before
proceeding with patient samples.
• If QC fails, troubleshoot and repeat QC analysis. Do not report
patient results until QC is acceptable.
6. PROCEDURE
1. Preparation and Instrument Setup:
◦ Power on the analyzer and complete any necessary start-up
procedures.
◦ Load reagents, calibrators, and QC materials onto the
analyzer. Check the expiration dates and storage conditions
of all reagents.
2. Specimen Processing:
◦ Centrifuge SSTs at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes to separate
serum from cells.
◦ Transfer the serum to a clean labeled tube if not being
immediately analyzed.
3. Loading Samples:
◦ Place the serum samples on the analyzer sample rack.
◦ Input the necessary patient and sample information into the
analyzer system or laboratory information system (LIS).
4. Analyzing Samples:
◦ Select the Haptoglobin assay on the analyzer software.
◦ Start the analysis according to the analyzer's operational
instructions.
◦ Monitor the analysis process for any issues or alerts.
5. Results Verification:
◦ Review the analyzer-generated results to ensure they fall
within the expected reference range.
◦ Compare results against QC data to validate accuracy.
◦ Address any flagged results or instrument alerts according
to the troubleshooting procedures.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
• Record the final Haptoglobin results in the LIS.
• Verify that all patient and sample information is accurate.
• Notify the appropriate healthcare provider of any critical or
abnormal results as per lab protocol.
8. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Adult Reference Range: 30-200 mg/dL (please refer to the
specific reference range provided by reagent kit instructions, as it
may vary slightly)
• Establish site-specific reference intervals if they differ from the
provided range.
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples can interfere with accurate
measurement.
• Cross-reactivity with other serum proteins in rare cases.
• Refer to the reagent kit insert for detailed limitations and
interferences.
10. QUALITY ASSURANCE AND TROUBLESHOOTING
• Document all maintenance and QC procedures according to
laboratory protocols.
• Investigate and document any discrepancies or out-of-range QC
results.
• Perform correlation studies when changing reagent lots or
performing major instrument maintenance.
