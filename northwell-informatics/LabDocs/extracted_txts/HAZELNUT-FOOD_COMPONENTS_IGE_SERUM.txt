Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for HAZELNUT-FOOD
COMPONENTS, IGE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
To define the procedure for performing and reporting the analytical
testing for Hazelnut-Food Components, IgE, Serum using the
laboratory immunoassay systems to ensure accurate and reliable
patient results.
RESPONSIBILITY
• It is the responsibility of all laboratory technologists to perform the
procedure accurately and ensure quality control.
• It is the responsibility of the supervisor to oversee the procedure
and validate results.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND HANDLING
Specimen:
• Preferred: 5 mL of serum.
• Minimum: 2 mL of serum.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric specimens.
• Specimens that have been at room temperature for more than 8
hours.
Specimen Stability:
• Refrigerated (2-8°C): Stable for up to 7 days.
• Frozen (-20°C or lower): Stable for up to 30 days.
• Repeated freezing and thawing should be avoided.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
Equipment:
• Immunoassay analyzer (e.g., ImmunoCAP, or another
manufacturer specified immunoassay system).
• Centrifuge.
• Refrigerators.
• Freezers.
• Micropipettes and pipette tips.
• Timer.
Reagents:
• Allergen-specific IgE reagents for hazelnut food components.
• Calibration and control materials.
• Wash buffer.
• Substrate solution.
• Stop solution.
1. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
• Ensure all reagents and controls are at room temperature before
use.
• Prepare all necessary materials: pipettes, tubes, and reagents.
• Check the expiration dates of all reagents and controls.
Calibration:
• Perform calibration of the immunoassay analyzer according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
• Each new lot number of reagents requires a calibration run.
Quality Control:
• Two levels of IgE control (Positive and Negative) must be run
each day of testing.
• Document the QC results. Acceptable ranges must be met before
patient samples are processed.
Testing Process:
1. Centrifuge the specimen at 1500-2000 x g for 10 minutes to
obtain serum.
2. Transfer the required volume of serum to a sample cup or tube,
ensuring no carryover contamination.
3. Load the sample cups/tubes into the immunoassay analyzer.
4. Follow the manufacturer's protocol for sample loading, reagent
addition, incubation, washing, and detection.
5. Run the assay following specific instrument instructions for the
IgE test for hazelnut food components. Ensure adherence to
the timed incubation and washing steps as specified.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results are expressed in kilounits per liter (kU/L) and interpreted
as provided in the testing protocol and reference materials.
• Review and verify results via the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
• Flag any results that fall outside the reference ranges or are
critical.
Reporting Reference Values:
• < 0.35 kU/L: Negative
• 0.35-0.70 kU/L: Low
• 0.71-3.50 kU/L: Moderate
• 3.50 kU/L: High
Critical Results:
• Any critical value must be communicated immediately to the
requesting physician or healthcare provider following the lab’s
critical value policy.
1. DOCUMENTATION AND RECORD KEEPING
• Record all specimen and assay information in the LIS.
• Maintain daily logs of calibrations, controls, and test runs.
• Ensure proper documentation of any troubleshooting steps and
corrective actions.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING
Common Issues:
• Calibration Failure: Repeat calibration; if it persists, follow
troubleshooting guidelines provided in the equipment manual.
• QC Out of Range: Do not process patient samples. Determine
cause, take corrective action, and re-run controls.
• Equipment Error Messages: Follow manufacturer instructions to
resolve.
Other Issues:
• For unresolved issues, refer to the equipment supplier’s technical
support or follow internal SOPs for additional troubleshooting.
