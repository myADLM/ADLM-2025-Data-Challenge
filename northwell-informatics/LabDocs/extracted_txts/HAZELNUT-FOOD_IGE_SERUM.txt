Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for HAZELNUT-FOOD, IGE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the procedures necessary for the analysis, quality
control, and result generation of Hazelnut-food specific IgE in serum
samples to ensure accurate and reproducible results.
Responsibility: A technologist or designated laboratory staff will
perform the assay, monitor quality control, and report the results
according to this SOP.
1. PRINCIPLE
This test utilizes a highly specific immunoassay to detect and quantify
IgE antibodies against hazelnut proteins in the patient’s serum,
indicative of hypersensitivity or allergic reaction to hazelnuts.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred Specimen: 5-10 mL of serum collected in a serum
separator tube (SST). Acceptable Specimen: 5-10 mL of serum
collected in a plain red-top tube. Unacceptable Specimen:
Hemolyzed, lipemic, or grossly contaminated specimens.
Specimens should be stored at 2-8°C if analysis will be performed
within 48 hours. For longer storage, freeze at -20°C or lower ensuring
no freeze-thaw cycles occur.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Immunoassay analyzer capable of quantifying IgE specific
antibodies
• Hazelnut IgE reagent kit (Ensure it's within expiry date)
• Calibrators and controls for IgE
• Pipettes and tips
• Sample tubes
• Centrifuge
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
• Laboratory Information System (LIS) for result entry
1. PROCEDURE
2. Prepare the immunoassay analyzer according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
3. Allow the patient sera, controls, and reagents to reach room
temperature.
4. Verify that all reagents, controls, and calibrators are not
expired.
5. Calibrate the analyzer using the provided calibrators ensuring
that calibration is within acceptable ranges.
6. Process the quality controls in the same manner as patient
samples to ensure the system is performing accurately.
◦ Document QC results and ensure they fall within the
specified range before proceeding to patient samples.
7. Centrifuge patient serum specimens at 1500 x g for 10 minutes
if necessary to remove any particulate matter.
8. Load patient serum samples, quality controls, and calibrators
onto the analyzer.
9. Follow the analyzer's prompts to initiate and complete the
assay run.
10. Once the assay is complete, verify the assay data on the
instrument display for any flagged results or errors.
11. Transfer quantitative results from the analyzer to the LIS:
◦ Verify correct patient identification.
◦ Review quality control data and patient results before
verification.
12. Analyze flagged or abnormal results to determine if repeat or
further analysis is necessary.
13. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run at least two levels of quality control (QC) daily before patient
testing.
• If QC fails, troubleshoot according to the instrument manual, re-
run QC, and do not proceed with patient samples until control
issues are resolved.
• Document all QC results and corrective actions taken.
1. RESULTS REPORTING
• Results are verified by the technologist and transmitted
electronically to the LIS.
• Review and verify patient results ensuring they meet the
laboratory’s acceptance criteria.
• Document and report any laboratory-related result interferences
or invalid results.
• Critical values and results requiring immediate clinical attention
should be communicated to the ordering provider as per
laboratory policy.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Negative: <0.35 kU/L
• Low Positive: 0.35 - 0.70 kU/L
• Moderate Positive: 0.71 - 3.50 kU/L
• High Positive: 3.51 - 17.5 kU/L
• Very High Positive: >17.5 kU/L
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to the instrument's and reagent kit's insert for detailed
limitations of the assay.
• Hemolysis, lipemia, and specimen integrity issues can interfere
with the test result.

hazelnut-specific IgE in patient serum can be achieved, providing
critical information for the diagnosis and management of food
allergies.
