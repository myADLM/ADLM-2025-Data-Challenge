1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedure for the analytical
phase of generating results for Hazelnut-Food, IgE with Reflex to
Hazelnut-Food Components, IgE, Serum. This protocol ensures
accurate, consistent, and timely results while maintaining compliance
with regulatory standards.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel responsible for
performing analysis and reporting results of Hazelnut-Food, IgE with
Reflex to Hazelnut-Food Components, IgE, Serum test in a clinical
laboratory setting.
3. RESPONSIBILITIES
• Laboratory Technologists: Perform the analysis as outlined in
this SOP.
• Supervisors: Ensure procedures are followed and verify the
results.
• Quality Control Personnel: Monitor and document quality
control processes.
4. SPECIMENS
4.1 Acceptable Specimens:
• Serum collected in appropriate collection tubes (e.g., SST tube).
• Specimens must be labeled correctly and accompanied by
relevant clinical information.
4.2 Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric specimens.
• Specimens collected in unapproved tubes.
• Specimens stored or transported under inappropriate conditions.
5. REAGENTS, EQUIPMENT, AND SUPPLIES
• ImmunoCAP® system (or equivalent accredited equipment)
• Multitest allergen kit for Hazelnut IgE and components
• Positive and negative IgE control sera
• Pipettes and calibrated micropipettes
• Microplates specific to ImmunoCAP® system
• Refrigerators and freezers for specimen and reagent storage
6. PROCEDURE
6.1 Pre-analytical Phase:
1. Confirm patient specimen identity and adequateness.
2. Centrifuge serum specimens at 1,000-1,300 x g for 10 minutes
if necessary.
3. Allow all reagents and specimens to reach room temperature.
4. Check quality control sera for expiration and integrity.
6.2 Assay Setup:
1. Calibration:
◦ Run the calibration curve using the provided calibrators.
◦ Follow manufacturer instructions for setting up and running
calibrators.
2. Hazelnut IgE Screening:
◦ Pipette patient specimens, calibrators, quality control, and
blank samples into appropriate wells.
◦ Incubate as per manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Wash plates using the automated washer as instructed.
◦ Add detection antibodies and incubate accordingly.
◦ Add substrate and incubate for required time.
◦ Stop the reaction by adding stop solution.
3. Reading Results:
◦ Read the absorbance at the specific wavelength
recommended by the kit's protocol.
◦ Record absorbance values and calculate results using the
calibration curve.
6.3 Reflex Testing:
1. If Hazelnut-Food IgE levels are above the predefined threshold:
◦ Perform component specific IgE testing (Hazelnut
components such as Cor a 1, Cor 2, Cor a 8, etc.).
2. Follow the same procedure for initial Hazelnut IgE testing for
reflex components testing.
3. Document any reflex testing performed and the corresponding
results.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Run positive and negative controls with each assay batch.
2. Ensure control results fall within expected ranges before
validating patient results.
3. Investigate and document any deviations or out of range QC
results, and initiate corrective actions if necessary.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Validate results through the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
2. Review and approve the results by the assigned supervisor.
3. Report results according to site-specific guidelines.
• Reference Intervals: Refer to specific allergy-related guidelines
to determine cutoff values for positive and negative results.
9. RECORD-KEEPING
1. Record all assay details, including calibration curves, QC
results, and patient results.
2. Ensure proper maintenance and documentation of equipment
according to manufacturer guidelines.
10. TROUBLESHOOTING
1. If assay controls are out of range, repeat the test with fresh
reagents.
2. Follow equipment troubleshooting guidelines for any
instrument-related issues.
3. Consult with the supervisor or quality assurance team for
persistent issues and corrective measures.
11. SAFETY AND REGULATORY COMPLIANCE
1. Adhere to all laboratory safety protocols, including the use of
PPE.
2. Dispose of waste according to biohazard regulations.
3. Ensure compliance with CLIA and other relevant regulatory
standards.
