Protocol for Generating Results for HAZELNUT-TREE, IGE,
SERUM
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is to
provide detailed instructions for the analytical phase of generating
results for the Hazel Tree, IgE, Serum assay. This SOP ensures
consistency, accuracy, and reliability of test results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of laboratory technologists to perform the assay
in accordance with this SOP. It is also the responsibility of the
laboratory supervisor to review and verify the final results before
reporting.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred Specimen:
• Serum sample
• Collected in a red-top tube or serum separator tube (SST)
• A minimum volume of 1 mL of serum
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Grossly hemolyzed, icteric, or lipemic specimens
• Specimens in other types of anticoagulant tubes
• Insufficient volume for testing
Specimen Storage:
• Specimens should be stored at 2-8°C if the testing will be
performed within 7 days.
• If storage is required for longer periods, freeze serum at -20°C or
colder.
• Avoid repeated freeze/thaw cycles.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Immunoassay analyzer (e.g., ImmunoCAP 250, Phadia 250)
• Centrifuge
• Micropipettes and tips
• Vortex mixer
• Calibrated Timer
Reagents:
• Allergenic reagent for Hazelnut Tree, IgE
• Calibration standards
• Control materials (high and low)
• Wash buffer
• Reaction buffer
** Supplies:**
• Serum separator tubes (SST)
• Red-top collection tubes
• Gloves
• Sample cups
• Microcentrifuge tubes
5. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Allow all reagents and control materials to come to room
temperature before use.
2. Prepare the Immunoassay analyzer according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. This includes running system
checks and calibrating the instrument with provided calibration
standards.
3. Label all reagents and control solutions with the date of opening
and expiration.
Sample Preparation:
1. Centrifuge blood collection tubes at 1500 x g for 10 minutes to
separate serum.
2. Transfer the serum to a properly labeled microcentrifuge tube.
3. Ensure there is a minimum of 1 mL of serum available for
analysis.
Loading Samples:
1. Place sample cups into the designated positions on the
analyzer.
2. Load quality control (QC) materials and calibration standards
into the appropriate positions on the analyzer.
Running the Assay:
1. Use the analyzer software to select the assay: Hazelnut Tree,
IgE, Serum.
2. Follow the analyzer startup procedure to begin the run.
3. Ensure that the reaction buffer, wash buffer, and allergenic
reagent are correctly loaded and sufficient in quantity for the
number of samples being processed.
4. Initiate the assay run. The instrument will automatically process
the samples, run the QCs, and provide results.
Quality Control:
1. Check that the results for the QC samples are within the
established acceptable ranges.
2. If the QC results are out of range, troubleshoot by checking
reagent integrity, calibration, and instrument performance.
3. Do not report patient results until QC issues are resolved.
6. RESULT INTERPRETATION AND REPORTING
1. The test results will be expressed as specific IgE
concentrations in kilo units per liter (kU/L).
2. Document anomalies such as hemolysis or lipemia in samples
on the result report.
3. Review results along with QC data to ensure validity.
4. Only verified and signed-off results are to be reported in the
Laboratory Information System (LIS).
Reference Ranges:
• <0.35 kU/L: Negative
• 0.35-0.69 kU/L: Low Positive
• 0.70-3.49 kU/L: Moderate Positive
• 3.50-17.49 kU/L: High Positive
• 17.50-49.99 kU/L: Very High Positive
• ≥50.00 kU/L: Extremely High Positive
7. DOCUMENT CONTROL
1. Maintain all records of calibration, QC results, and patient
results per laboratory policy.
2. Ensure proper documentation of any troubleshooting steps and
corrective actions taken.
3. Archive the temperature logs, maintenance records, and QC
logs for at least two years.
