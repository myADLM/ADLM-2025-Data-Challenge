Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for HAZELNUT COMPONENT PANEL
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to establish a standardized procedure for
the analysis of hazelnut component panel tests, ensuring accurate
and reliable results consistent with CLIA regulations.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of designated laboratory staff to follow this
procedure accurately. It is the responsibility of supervisors to ensure
staff adherence to this SOP and to address any issues that arise
during the analysis process. 2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND
STABILITY
Specimen Type: Serum Specimen Volume: 1 mL Unacceptable
Specimens: Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric specimens; specimens
with improper labeling or those that fail to meet collection criteria.
Specimen Stability: Refrigerated (2-8°C): 7 days Frozen (-20°C): 1
month 3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Instrumentation: ImmunoCAP 250 analyzer (or other equivalent
analyzer specified by the laboratory) Reagents: Specific ImmunoCAP
reagents for hazelnut component panel tests Quality Control
Materials: Commercially available control sera specific for IgE Other
Supplies: Calibrated micropipettes and tips, vortex mixer, centrifuge,
laboratory timer, sample racks 4. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation
Allow reagents, control materials, and patient specimens to reach
room temperature prior to analysis. Ensure expiration dates of all
reagents and control materials are valid. Prepare the analyzer
according to the manufacturer's instructions. Perform daily
maintenance and calibration checks as recommended by the
manufacturer.
B. Sample Processing
Centrifuge patient serum specimens at 1500 x g for 10 minutes to
separate serum from cells. Transfer the required volume (1 mL) of
serum into appropriately labeled sample cups. Place the sample cups
in the analyzer’s sample rack. C. Loading the Analyzer
Load reagents and quality control materials into appropriate reagent
positions on the analyzer. Load the patient samples and control
samples into the appropriate positions on the sample tray. Ensure
that all positions are correctly labeled and aligned according to the
analyzer’s software configuration. D. Running the Analysis
Start the analysis according to the manufacturer's operating
procedure for the ImmunoCAP 250 analyzer. Ensure that the
analyzer is operating correctly and monitor the run for any
irregularities or error messages. Allow the analysis to complete and
confirm that all patient and control samples have been processed. 5.
QUALITY CONTROL
Run internal quality control samples (positive and negative controls)
with each batch of patient specimens. Review quality control results
to ensure they fall within the established acceptable range.
Document any QC failures and take corrective actions as necessary,
such as repeating the QC or patient samples after troubleshooting. 6.
INTERPRETING AND REPORTING RESULTS
Review raw data generated by the analyzer. Ensure all control values
are within acceptable limits before interpreting patient results.
Compare the patient’s IgE levels against reference ranges or
interpretive criteria outlined in the manufacturer's package insert.
Document and verify results in the laboratory information system
(LIS). Review results for critical values and follow the procedure for
reporting critical values to the appropriate healthcare provider. 7.
TROUBLESHOOTING
If an error occurs during the analysis, refer to the manufacturer’s
troubleshooting guide for the ImmunoCAP 250 analyzer. Common
issues include reagent or sample misloading, instrument malfunction,
and calibration errors. Document any troubleshooting steps taken
and the resolution in the equipment maintenance log. 8.
