Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for HAZELNUT COMPONENT RCOR A1
1. PURPOSE
To detail the protocol for the analytical phase of generating results for
Hazelnut Component RCOR A1 to ensure accurate, reliable, and
consistent results in compliance with CLIA-certified laboratory
standards.
Responsibility: Laboratory technologists are responsible for
performing the analytical procedures as outlined in this SOP. It is the
responsibility of the supervising laboratory manager to ensure
adherence to these procedures and to address any deviations or
issues that arise.
1. SPECIMEN
Preferred / Acceptable:
• Serum or plasma collected in a gel separator tube (SST) or
heparinized tube (PST).
• 2 mL minimum volume.
• Specimens should be collected and handled according to
standard phlebotomy procedures and processed within 1 hour of
collection.
Unacceptable:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
• Specimens collected in EDTA or citrate tubes.
• Specimens received more than 24 hours after collection without
refrigeration.
• Specimens without proper labeling (patient name, date, and time
of collection).
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Centrifuge capable of achieving adequate separation of serum/
plasma.
• Vortex mixer.
• Refrigerated storage unit maintaining 2-8°C.
• Laboratory grade microtiter plate reader.
• Calibrated pipettes (single and multi-channel).
• Hazardous waste disposal containers.
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) including lab coat, gloves,
and safety goggles.
1. REAGENTS
• Hazelnut Component RCOR A1 antibody test kit.
◦ Store at 2-8°C.
◦ Do not use after expiration date.
◦ Allow reagents to come to room temperature before use.
• Calibrator and control solutions.
◦ Store as per manufacturer instructions.
◦ Use within the stability period indicated by the manufacturer.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Preparation:
• Centrifuge the blood collection tube at 1500-2000 x g for 10
minutes to separate serum/plasma from the cells.
• Transfer the serum/plasma to a labeled microtube using a
calibrated pipette.
• Store the specimen at 2-8°C if not used immediately.
B. Test Preparation:
• Equilibrate the reagents and samples to room temperature
(18-25°C) for 30 minutes prior to testing.
• Prepare the microtiter plate as per the manufacturer’s
instructions.
C. Assay Procedure:
1. Add 100 µL of calibrator, controls, and patient specimens into
designated wells.
2. Incubate the plate at 37°C for 60 minutes.
3. Following incubation, wash the wells 5 times with the wash
buffer provided.
4. Add 100 µL of conjugate solution into each well.
5. Incubate the plate at 37°C for 30 minutes.
6. Wash the wells 5 times with the wash buffer provided.
7. Add 100 µL of substrate solution into each well.
8. Incubate the plate in the dark for 15 minutes at room
temperature.
9. Add 100 µL of stop solution to each well to terminate the
reaction.
10. Read the plate at 450 nm using a microtiter plate reader within
30 minutes of adding the stop solution.
11. QUALITY CONTROL:
• Ensure all reagents are within expiration dates and have been
stored appropriately.
• Include both positive and negative controls with each run.
• Results from controls must be within the established ranges for
the run to be valid. Re-run the assay or contact the supervisor if
controls are outside acceptable limits.
1. REPORTING RESULTS:
• Generate a standard curve by plotting the optical density (OD) of
the calibrators against their concentrations.
• Determine the concentration of Hazelnut Component RCOR A1 in
patient samples by interpolating their OD values on the standard
curve.
• Record and verify results in the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS:
• Negative: <20 kU/L
• Indeterminate: 20-30 kU/L
• Positive: >30 kU/L
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples may interfere with the
assay.
• Samples with extremely high antibody levels may need to be
diluted and re-assayed.
• Refer to the kit insert for additional limitations and troubleshooting
guidelines.
1. SAMPLE INTEGRITY:
• Verify specimen labeling and documentation.
• Assess specimens for hemolysis, lipemia, or icterus.
• Centrifuge samples and re-assess if sample integrity is in
question.
11: CRITICAL RESULTS:
• Notify the ordering physician immediately if results exceed the
critical limits.
• Document the notification in the LIS and patient’s chart according
to laboratory policy.
