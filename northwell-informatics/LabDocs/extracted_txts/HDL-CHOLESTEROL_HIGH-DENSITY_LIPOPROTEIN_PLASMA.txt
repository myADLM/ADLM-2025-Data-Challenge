Title: Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
HDL-Cholesterol (High-Density Lipoprotein) Determination in Plasma
1. PURPOSE
To ensure accurate and reliable measurement of HDL-cholesterol in
plasma specimens by following a standardized process. This SOP
defines the procedure for the analytical phase in the generation of
HDL-cholesterol results.
1. SCOPE
This procedure covers guidelines for handling, processing, analyzing,
and reporting results for HDL-cholesterol in plasma samples using
appropriate laboratory equipment and reagents.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
• Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the
analysis and adhering to these guidelines.
• Supervisors ensure that staff comply with this SOP and address
any non-conformance or deviations.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Preferred/Acceptable Specimens:
• Plasma collected in lavender-top (EDTA) or green-top (heparin)
tubes.
• Ensure at least 1 mL of plasma is available for analysis.
• Specimens should be centrifuged and plasma separated as soon
as possible (ideally within 2 hours).
Stability:
• Room Temperature: stable for up to 4 hours.
• Refrigerated (2-8°C): stable for up to 5 days.
• Frozen (-20°C or colder): stable for up to 6 months. Avoid
repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed specimens.
• Samples with significant lipemia unless pre-processed.
• Samples with inappropriate anticoagulant.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• HDL-Cholesterol reagent set (calibrated and verified periodically
according to manufacturer's instructions)
• Calibrator and Control materials specific for HDL-cholesterol
testing
• Automated Chemistry Analyzer (must be maintained and
calibrated as per manufacturer's protocols)
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
1. PROCEDURE
A) Pre-Analysis:
1. Verification:
• Ensure specimens are correctly labeled and match accompanying
documentation.
• Check for specimen quality, note any deviations such as
hemolysis or improper storage.
1. Preparation:
• For fresh plasma, centrifuge specimen at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes
to obtain clear plasma if not already done.
• Aliquot if needed and label appropriately.
B) Analysis:
1. Instrument Setup:
• Confirm that the chemistry analyzer is properly calibrated using
appropriate standards.
• Run quality control materials to verify instrument performance
prior to testing patient samples. Acceptable ranges must be met
before proceeding.
1. Loading Specimens:
• Load plasma specimens onto the automated chemistry analyzer
following loading instructions for your specific equipment.
• Use barcodes if applicable for sample identification and tracking.
1. Running the Test:
• Select the HDL-cholesterol test on the analyzer menu and follow
the on-screen prompts.
• Confirm that analyzers dispense reagent accurately and mix
specimens thoroughly.
• Ensure timely processing to avoid delays affecting the stability of
the analyte.
C) Post-Analysis:
1. Reviewing Results:
• Review analyzer-generated results for each specimen.
• Assess quality control data; if QC results are out of range, do not
report patient results until the issue is resolved.
• Document any troubleshooting or corrective actions taken as
required.
1. Verification and Reporting:
• Results must be verified by a senior technologist if abnormal
values or inconsistencies are observed.
• Report results according to the laboratory information system
(LIS) guidelines and reference intervals.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Desirable HDL Levels:
◦ Men: ≥ 40 mg/dL (≥ 1.0 mmol/L)
◦ Women: ≥ 50 mg/dL (≥ 1.3 mmol/L)
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform daily quality control using two levels of control material
(normal and abnormal range).
• Document QC results in the control log.
• Investigate and rectify any QC failures before proceeding with
patient sample analysis.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Variability in results can occur due to improper specimen
handling.
• Lipemia, hemolysis, or icteric samples may interfere with accurate
measurements.
• Confirm results with additional testing if unexpected, especially in
patients with known conditions that affect lipid metabolism.
