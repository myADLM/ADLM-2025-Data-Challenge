HEARTLAND VIRUS, RNA, MOLECULAR DETECTION, PCR,
SERUM
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this standard operating procedure (SOP) is to
describe the analytical phase procedures for the detection of
Heartland virus RNA in serum samples using real-time polymerase
chain reaction (RT-PCR). This includes guidelines for sample
preparation, amplification, detection, and interpretation of results. The
goal is to ensure accurate, reliable and timely results for patient
management and epidemiological tracking.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of all trained laboratory personnel to adhere to
this SOP when performing molecular detection of Heartland virus
RNA. Supervisors must verify that all procedures are followed
correctly and ensure that personnel are adequately trained and
equipped.
2. DEFINITION
Serum: The clear, yellowish fluid portion of the blood that remains
after coagulation. It is obtained by centrifuging clotted blood to
remove cells and clotting factors.
RT-PCR: Real-time polymerase chain reaction, a laboratory
technique combining reverse transcription of RNA into DNA and
amplification of specific DNA targets using PCR.
3. PROCEDURE
A. Equipment and Reagents:
• Real-time PCR instrument
• Microcentrifuge
• Pipettes and filtered tips
• Vortex mixer
• RNA extraction kit
• Heartland virus-specific primers and probes
• RT-PCR master mix
• Nuclease-free water
• Controls (Positive control with known Heartland virus RNA,
Negative control with nuclease-free water)
B. Sample Preparation:
1. Serum Separation:
◦ Upon receiving the serum sample, verify that it has been
correctly labeled and is within the acceptance criteria
(received within the appropriate time frame, appropriate
sample volume, no hemolysis).
2. RNA Extraction:
◦ Use a validated RNA extraction kit to isolate RNA from the
serum sample, following the manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Include an appropriate extraction control to monitor the
efficiency of the extraction process.
◦ Perform all steps in a designated clean area to prevent
contamination.
C. PCR Amplification:
1. Preparation of Reaction Mix:
◦ Thaw all reagents on ice. Gently mix the reagents and
briefly centrifuge to collect contents at the bottom of the
tubes.
◦ Prepare the RT-PCR master mix on ice:
▪ Volume (µL) per reaction:
▪ 1X RT-PCR Master Mix: X µL
▪ Forward Primer (10 µM): Y µL
▪ Reverse Primer (10 µM): Y µL
▪ Probe (10 µM): Z µL
▪ Nuclease-free Water: Adjust to final volume
▪ RNA Template: Add last (N µL)
◦ Calculate the total volume required for the number of
samples, including controls.
2. Adding Samples:
◦ Aliquot the reaction mix into individual PCR tubes or 96-well
plates.
◦ Add the RNA templates (extracted from the sample),
Positive Control, and Negative Control to the appropriate
wells.
◦ Seal the tubes or plates properly to prevent evaporation.
3. PCR Cycling Conditions:
◦ Load the tubes or plates into the real-time PCR instrument.
◦ Set up the cycling parameters:
▪ Reverse Transcription: 50°C for 10 min
▪ Initial Denaturation: 95°C for 2 min
▪ Amplification (X cycles):
▪ Denaturation: 95°C for 15 sec
▪ Annealing/Extension: 60°C for 1 min
◦ Select the appropriate detection channel for the fluorescent
reporter.
D. Data Analysis and Reporting:
1. Quality Control:
◦ Verify that all controls have performed as expected before
interpreting patient results.
◦ Positive Control must show amplification within the
predefined cycle threshold (Ct) range.
◦ Negative Control must show no amplification (no Ct value or
a value significantly higher than the cut-off).
2. Interpretation:
◦ Assess the Ct values for patient samples:
▪ If Ct value is ≤ cut-off: Positive for Heartland virus RNA.
▪ If Ct value is undetermined or > cut-off: Negative for
Heartland virus RNA.
▪ Inconclusive results may need repeat testing or
additional sample submission.
3. Documentation:
◦ Record all sample data, including control results,
amplification curves, and final interpretation in the
Laboratory Information System (LIS).
◦ Notify the appropriate clinical personnel of positive results
immediately.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform regular maintenance and calibration of PCR instruments
following manufacturer’s instructions.
• Utilize validated reagents and primers/probes with each batch of
tests.
• Include both positive and negative controls in every run to monitor
the integrity of the reagents and overall assay performance.
• Document all QC results and take appropriate corrective actions if
any control fails.
5. SAFETY AND HANDLING
• Follow all biosafety guidelines for handling infectious agents.
• Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during all
stages of the procedure.
• Dispose of all biohazardous waste according to established
protocols.

7. REVIEW AND REVISION
• This SOP will be reviewed annually or whenever new guidelines
are issued.
• Any changes to the protocol will be documented and
disseminated to all relevant personnel.
