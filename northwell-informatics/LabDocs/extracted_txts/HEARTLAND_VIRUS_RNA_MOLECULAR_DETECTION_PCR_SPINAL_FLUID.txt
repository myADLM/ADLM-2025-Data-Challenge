Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for HEARTLAND VIRUS, RNA, MOLECULAR
DETECTION, PCR, SPINAL FLUID
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the analytical procedures for the
detection of Heartland Virus RNA in spinal fluid samples using
Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR).
Responsibility:
Laboratory personnel are responsible for following this SOP to
ensure accurate and reliable results. It is the responsibility of the
laboratory supervisor to ensure compliance with these procedures.
1. SPECIMEN
• Specimen Type: Spinal Fluid
• Collection: Specimens must be collected aseptically in sterile
containers and promptly transported to the laboratory.
• Acceptance Criteria: Only properly labeled specimens in
appropriate containers received within the requisite time frame will
be accepted for analysis.
• Rejection Criteria: Specimens will be rejected if they are not
properly labeled, if there is contamination or leakage, or if they
are not received within the proper storage conditions or time
frame.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Equipment: Real-time PCR machine, centrifuge, biosafety
cabinet, microcentrifuge, vortex mixer, pipettes, and pipette tips.
• Reagents:
◦ Viral RNA extraction kit
◦ Real-time PCR master mix
◦ Heartland Virus-specific primers and probes
◦ Nuclease-free water
• Supplies: PCR tubes/plates, sterile filter tips, sample collection
containers, gloves, and laboratory coat.
1. PROCEDURE
A) Specimen Processing:
1. Specimens should be logged in and stored at 2-8°C if not
processed immediately. For long-term storage, freeze at -70°C.
2. Thaw frozen specimens on ice and mix thoroughly by vortexing.
3. Aseptic techniques should be used during specimen handling to
avoid contamination.
B) RNA Extraction:
1. Perform RNA extraction from 200 µL of spinal fluid using the
viral RNA extraction kit as per the manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Elute the RNA in 50 µL of nuclease-free water.
3. Store extracted RNA at -70°C or proceed immediately to the
PCR setup.
C) PCR Setup:
1. Prepare the PCR master mix:
◦ Mix the real-time PCR master mix with Heartland Virus-
specific primers and probes as per the manufacturer’s
recommended concentration.
◦ Include internal control RNA to monitor the PCR process.
2. Aliquot the master mix into PCR tubes/plates.
3. Add 5 µL of extracted RNA to each reaction tube/plate well.
4. Include negative controls (nuclease-free water) and positive
controls (viral RNA or synthetic RNA) in the PCR assay.
D) PCR Cycling Conditions:
1. Load the PCR tubes/plates into the real-time PCR machine.
2. Set the PCR cycling parameters:
◦ Initial reverse transcription: 50°C for 15 minutes
◦ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 2 minutes
◦ 40 cycles of:
▪ Denaturation: 95°C for 15 seconds
▪ Annealing/Extension: 60°C for 45 seconds
3. Record the fluorescence data for each cycle.
E) Data Analysis:
1. Analyze the real-time PCR data using the PCR machine
software.
2. Determine the cycle threshold (Ct) values for each sample and
control.
3. The presence of Heartland Virus RNA is indicated by a Ct value
within the acceptable range for the positive control. Samples
with Ct values above the negative control threshold but below
the positive control threshold are considered positive.
4. Results are deemed valid if the internal control amplifies
appropriately in both positive and negative controls.
5. QUALITY CONTROL:
• Run positive and negative controls with each batch of specimens
processed.
• Ensure that internal controls are amplified in each reaction to
confirm the integrity of the PCR process.
• Monitor the Ct values for all controls. Results are considered
invalid if the controls do not perform within the expected range.
• Document all quality control steps and perform corrective actions
if required.
1. REPORTING RESULTS:
• Results are recorded and reviewed by laboratory personnel.
• Positive results for Heartland Virus RNA should be reported as
“Detected.”
• Negative results should be reported as “Not Detected.”
• Report any invalid or indeterminate results with a
recommendation to repeat the assay, indicating "Indeterminate."
• Ensure compliance with laboratory and regulatory guidelines for
result reporting and confidentiality.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS:
• Positive: Ct value within the defined range for positive control.
• Negative: Ct value above the defined threshold for negative
control.
1. REFERENCES:
• Manufacturer’s instructions for the viral RNA extraction kit and
real-time PCR reagents.
• Current scientific guidelines on molecular detection of viral RNA.
This SOP ensures that the detection of Heartland Virus RNA in spinal
fluid samples is conducted accurately and reliably using PCR
methodology. Regular review and updates of the procedure will
ensure continued compliance with best practices and advancements
in technology.
