Protocol for Analytical Phase of Heavy Metal Testing in Hair
Samples
1. Purpose
To provide accurate and reliable analysis of heavy metals in hair
samples. This procedure aims to ensure all steps are standardized,
reproducible, and conducted in compliance with CLIA guidelines.
2. Specimen Requirements
• Hair samples should be collected following designated pre-
analytical protocols to avoid contamination.
• Preferred quantity: 0.5-1 gram of hair, cut close to the scalp.
• Samples must be stored in clean, sealed containers and
accompanied by complete patient information.
3. Equipment and Reagents
• Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer (ICP-MS)
• Clean glassware and consumables
• High-purity reagents and standards for digestion and calibration
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
• Fume hood for sample preparation
• Analytical balance
• Laboratory log book
• Computer and Laboratory Information System (LIS)
4. Procedure
Sample Preparation:
1. Pre-treatment:
◦ Inspect hair samples visually and discard any visibly
contaminated or discolored segments.
2. Washing:
◦ Wash hair samples with deionized water followed by
acetone. Allow the samples to air dry in a clean
environment.
3. Digestion:
◦ Weigh approximately 0.2 grams of washed, dried hair.
◦ Place the hair sample into a digestion vessel.
◦ Add 5 mL of concentrated nitric acid and 2 mL of hydrogen
peroxide.
◦ Digest the samples using a microwave digestion system
according to manufacturer instructions.
◦ Ensure complete digestion and clarity of the solution. If
undigested material remains, additional digestion
procedures may be required.
Analysis:
1. Calibration:
◦ Prepare calibration standards according to laboratory
protocols and instrument requirements.
◦ Calibrate the ICP-MS using these standards.
◦ Ensure calibration curve passes acceptance criteria (e.g.,
R^2 value ≥ 0.995).
2. Instrument Setup:
◦ Set up ICP-MS parameters specific to the detection of
heavy metals (e.g., arsenic, lead, mercury, cadmium).
◦ Ensure all equipment is clean and properly functioning
before analysis.
3. Sample Measurement:
◦ Introduce digested hair samples into the ICP-MS.
◦ Measure heavy metal concentrations in each sample.
◦ Record all measurements, including QC samples, in the log
book.
Quality Control:
1. Internal Control:
◦ Analyze blank samples alongside hair samples to check for
contamination.
◦ Include known reference material or spiked samples within
the batch to evaluate accuracy.
◦ Run duplicate samples to assess reproducibility.
◦ Document QC results and investigate any values outside
acceptable limits.
2. External Control:
◦ Participate in external proficiency testing programs if
available.
5. Reporting Results
1. Data Review:
◦ Review all raw data and QC results for validity.
◦ Confirm that all calibration curves and controls meet
predefined acceptance criteria.
◦ Document any deviations and corrective actions taken.
2. Result Compilation:
◦ Verify accuracy and completeness of data entry into LIS.
◦ Calculate concentration values based on sample weight and
digestion volume.
◦ Include elements and concentration units as required by
local practice.
3. Final Verification:
◦ Ensure proper documentation and retention of all records.
◦ Results must be reviewed and verified by a qualified
technologist before release.
6. Reference Intervals
Consult specific toxicology guidelines or instrument manuals for
reference intervals of the heavy metals tested.
7. Method Limitations
• Possible contamination during sample collection, storage, or
processing.
• Instrument sensitivity and detection limits.
8. Corrective Actions
1. Troubleshooting:
◦ Repeat analysis for questionable or out-of-range results.
◦ Investigate and resolve equipment malfunctions.
2. Notification:
◦ Consult supervisor or pathologist for any critical or unusual
findings.
◦ Notify clinical staff of any urgent or critical results according
to lab policy.

By adhering strictly to this protocol, the integrity of heavy metal
testing in hair samples within the laboratory ensures high-quality
results for clinical and diagnostic purposes.
