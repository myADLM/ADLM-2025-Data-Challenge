Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Title: Analytical Phase Protocol
for Heavy Metals in Nails
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedure
for the analysis of heavy metals in nail specimens in the
laboratory, ensuring that the results generated are accurate,
reliable, and reproducible.
Responsibility:
• Designated staff are responsible for performing the analysis,
recording results, and maintaining quality control for heavy metal
analysis in nails as per this SOP.
• Supervisors are responsible for overseeing the process and
ensuring compliance with SOPs, quality control, and proper
documentation.
1. MATERIALS, EQUIPMENT, AND REAGENTS Equipment:
• Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS)
• Weighing balance (accurate to 0.01 mg)
• Ultra-sonicator
• Microwave digestion system
• Class A glassware (e.g., volumetric flasks)
• Centrifuge
Reagents:
• Nitric acid (trace metal grade)
• Hydrogen peroxide (trace metal grade)
• Calibration standards for selected heavy metals (e.g., Pb, Hg, As,
Cd)
• Distilled water (ultrapure)
Supplies:
• Nail clippers
• Collection tubes
• Disposable gloves
• Lab notebooks
• Appropriate certified reference materials for validation
1. SPECIMEN Specimen Collection:
• Preferred: Clean freshly clipped nails (finger or toe nails) collected
into a contamination-free container.
• Quantity: Ensure minimum sample size of 20 mg per test.
• Unacceptable: Specimens received in non-approved containers or
contaminated samples.
1. PROCEDURE A) Specimen Preparation:
2. Label the specimen container with the unique sample ID.
3. Use clean, sterile nail clippers to cut a sample of the nails.
4. Record the weight of the nail sample using a calibrated
weighing balance and document the weight in the lab notebook.
5. Transfer the nail sample into a microwave digestion vessel.
B) Digestion:
1. Add 5 mL of trace metal grade nitric acid and 2 mL of hydrogen
peroxide into the digestion vessel containing nail samples.
2. Securely close the vessel and place it in the microwave
digestion system.
3. Set the digestion parameters according to instrument guidelines
(e.g., ramp to appropriate temperature and hold time).
4. After digestion is complete, cool the solution to room
temperature and transfer it to a clean volumetric flask.
5. Dilute the digested sample to a final volume of 50 mL with
ultrapure distilled water.
6. Filter the solution if necessary to remove any undigested
particulate matter.
C) Calibration and Quality Control:
1. Prepare calibration standards for the selected heavy metals
(Pb, Hg, As, Cd) in appropriate concentrations.
2. Run calibration standards and ensure the calibration curve
meets the criteria (correlation coefficient > 0.990).
3. Analyze certified reference materials to validate the accuracy of
the method.
4. Run quality control samples (both low and high concentration)
with each batch of specimens to verify precision and accuracy.
D) Analysis by ICP-MS:
1. Set up the ICP-MS instrument according to manufacturer’s
instructions.
2. Calibrate the instrument using the prepared standards.
3. Introduce the digested sample into the ICP-MS for the
quantitative analysis of heavy metals.
4. Measure the concentration of each heavy metal in the sample.
5. Record data and verify using internal quality control criteria.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
7. Results must be reviewed and verified by the technologist.
8. Any values outside established reference ranges should be
flagged and reviewed.
9. Report heavy metal concentrations in appropriate units (e.g.,
μg/g).
10. Document the analysis and results in the Laboratory
Information System (LIS) and ensure correct identification of
the sample.
11. QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE
12. Ensure all instruments are properly calibrated and maintained.
13. Regularly participate in external proficiency testing for heavy
metal analysis.
14. Maintain all records of calibration, quality control, and sample
analysis.
15. METHOD LIMITATIONS Refer to the ICP-MS operation manual
and individual calibration standards for any limitations affecting
the analytical results, such as matrix effects or instrument
sensitivity.
REFERENCE MATERIALS:
• Manufacturer’s operation manuals for ICP-MS and microwave
digestion systems.
• Certified reference materials for heavy metals analysis.
• Published guidelines or protocols on heavy metal testing in
biological samples.
