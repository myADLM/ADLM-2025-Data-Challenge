Standard Operating Procedure Heavy Metals Screen with
Demographics, Blood
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the analysis of heavy metals
in human blood samples, ensuring the accuracy, reliability, and
consistency of results.
1. SCOPE
This SOP applies to the analysis of blood samples for heavy metals
(e.g., lead, mercury, arsenic, cadmium) in the laboratory. These
procedures should be performed by trained laboratory personnel.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
All laboratory personnel responsible for the analysis of heavy metals
must adhere to this SOP.
1. DEFINITIONS
Heavy Metals: Elements with high atomic weights and densities that
are toxic at low concentrations (e.g., lead, mercury, arsenic,
cadmium). Demographics: Information including patient name, date
of birth, gender, and other identifiers necessary for accurate results
reporting.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type: Whole blood collected in EDTA or Heparinized
tubes. Specimen Volume: A minimum of 5 mL of blood is required for
comprehensive analysis. Specimen Stability: Store specimens at
2-8°C. Samples are stable for up to 7 days under these conditions. If
storage longer than 7 days is required, freeze samples at -20°C.
Unacceptable Specimens: Hemolyzed specimens, clotted
specimens, partially filled tubes, and samples collected in non-
recommended containers.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer (ICP-MS)
• Class 100 Clean Bench
• Ultra-high purity argon gas
• Certified reference materials for calibration
• Calibration validation samples
• Diluent reagents (e.g., matrix-matched diluent)
• Quality control materials at multiple levels (high, medium, and
low)
1. PROCEDURE
7.1 Specimen Preparation
1. Verify specimen integrity and demographics. Reject specimens
that do not meet the criteria.
2. Using appropriate PPE and working under the Class 100 clean
bench, aliquot 1 mL of whole blood into labelled digestion
vessels.
3. Add a matrix-matched diluent to the blood sample in a 1:10
ratio. Cap the vessels.
7.2 Digestion Process
1. Place the digestion vessels into the microwave digestion
system.
2. Apply the appropriate digestion program specific to blood
samples, ensuring complete digestion. Typically, use nitric acid
under controlled temperatures.
3. Allow the digestion vessels to cool post-digestion.
7.3 ICP-MS Analysis
1. Calibrate the ICP-MS using certified reference materials.
Record calibration data.
2. Validate the calibration using calibration validation samples.
3. Prepare the instrument, ensuring all QC parameters are within
permissible limits.
4. Introduce the digested specimen into the ICP-MS.
5. Run certified reference materials between specimens for quality
control.
6. Record and save data for each specimen following analysis.
7.4 Quality Control
1. Analyze three levels of quality control materials (high, medium,
low) at the start and end of each analytical run.
2. If QC results are out of range, troubleshoot following the
manufacturer’s guidelines and repeat analysis until results are
within acceptable limits.
3. Document all QC analysis and corrective actions taken.
7.5 Result Verification and Reporting
1. Review and verify results against QC data.
2. Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
along with the demographic information.
3. Flag and verify critical values. Follow the protocol for reporting
critical results.
4. Ensure that all results are signed off by a qualified laboratory
technologist before releasing the report.
5. REPORTING RESULTS
Results will be reported within the designated reference intervals for
each heavy metal. Utilize specific codes and comments if the result is
outside the expected range or there were any complications during
analysis.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the manufacturer’s manual for any limitations related to
individual elements analyzed by ICP-MS.
