Protocol for the Analytical Phase of Generating Results for
HEAVY METALS SCREEN, WITH REFLEX, 24 HOUR, URINE
1. PURPOSE
To outline the standard operating procedures for analyzing and
reporting results of heavy metals screening in a 24-hour urine
specimen. This protocol ensures accurate and reliable results,
adhering to regulatory and laboratory standards.
2. SCOPE
This protocol applies to all laboratory personnel involved in
processing and analyzing 24-hour urine specimens for heavy metals
screening and reflex testing.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for:
• Performing the analysis as per this protocol.
• Recording and verifying results.
• Reporting findings according to established guidelines.
Laboratory supervisors are responsible for:
• Ensuring all staff adhere to this protocol.
• Providing training and oversight.
• Verifying corrective actions when necessary.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
4.1. Collection and Handling:
• Specimen Type: 24-hour urine collection.
• Volume Required: Minimum volume required for testing is 50 mL,
with a preferred volume of 100-200 mL.
• Container: Acid-washed polyethylene container.
• Preservative: No preservative.
• Labeling: The container must be clearly labeled with the patient's
name, the collection start and end times, and the total volume of
urine collected.
4.2. Transport and Storage:
• Transport the specimen to the laboratory as soon as possible.
• If immediate transport is not possible, store the specimen at
2-8°C. Do not freeze the urine sample.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer (ICP-MS)
• Calibration standards specific for each heavy metal.
• Quality control materials.
• Acid-washed labware (pipettes, tubes).
• NIST-traceable reference materials.
• Reagent grade acids (e.g., Nitric acid).
6. PROCEDURE
6.1. Pre-analytical Preparation:
• Verify the specimen integrity and labeling.
• Measure and record the total 24-hour urine volume.
• Aliquot an appropriate sample volume for analysis.
6.2. Sample Preparation:
• Acidify the urine sample to a pH <2 with concentrated nitric acid.
• Digest the sample if necessary to release the metals into the
solution (Heat the sample in a hot block if needed).
6.3. Instrument Calibration:
• Calibrate the ICP-MS daily using calibration standards that
bracket the expected concentration range of the analytes.
• Perform and document instrument performance checks and initial
quality control checks before running patient specimens.
6.4. Analysis:
• Load samples, calibration standards, and quality control materials
onto the ICP-MS system.
• Run the standard, sample, and control sequence ensuring that
the procedure has a clear sample identifier.
• Monitor instrument stability and performance throughout the run.
6.5. Quality Control:
• Run quality control samples (normal and high) at the beginning,
middle, and end of every batch.
• Ensure QC results fall within the pre-established acceptable
range.
• If QC fails, identify and resolve the issue before proceeding with
sample analysis.
6.6. Calculation and Reporting:
• Calculate the concentration of each heavy metal in the urine
sample, correcting for the total volume of 24-hour urine collection.
• Report results using the laboratory information system (LIS) after
review and validation by the technologist.
6.7. Reflex Testing:
• If any heavy metal exceeds the reference range, trigger the
predefined reflex testing protocol.
• The reflex protocol may include additional dilutions, confirmatory
tests, or more specific assays to quantify the excessive elements
accurately.
7. REFERENCE RANGES AND CRITICAL VALUES
• Reference ranges for each heavy metal should be specific as
documented in laboratory standards.
• Any results above the reference range should be referred for
reflex analysis.
• Critical values should be flagged and immediately reported to the
attending physician or clinician.
8. DOCUMENTATION
• All results, including calibration, quality control data, and sample
analysis, must be documented and maintained in accordance with
laboratory policy.
• Deviations, corrective actions, and reflex testing steps should be
documented comprehensively.
9. QUALITY CONTROL AND MAINTENANCE
• Regular maintenance of the ICP-MS should be performed as per
manufacturer guidelines.
• Periodic proficiency testing to ensure accuracy and reliability of
heavy metal analysis.
• Annual review of SOP by laboratory management to incorporate
updates and improvements.
10. REFERENCES
• ICP-MS manufacturer’s manual.
• Laboratory’s internal quality control and proficiency testing
guidelines.
• Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines.
• Relevant scientific literature and research articles on heavy metal
analysis in urine.
