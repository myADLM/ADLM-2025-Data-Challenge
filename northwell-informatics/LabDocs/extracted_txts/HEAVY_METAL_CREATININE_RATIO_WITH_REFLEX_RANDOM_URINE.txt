Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Heavy Metal/Creatinine
Ratio, with Reflex, Random, Urine
1. Purpose
This SOP describes the procedure for testing and analyzing Heavy
Metal/Creatinine Ratio, with Reflex, Random, Urine in a CLIA-
certified laboratory. The aim is to ensure accurate and reliable test
results which are necessary for patient diagnosis and treatment.
2. Specimen Requirements and Stability
Specimen Type:
• Random urine sample
Specimen Container:
• Clean, dry, leak-proof, and properly labeled container
Specimen Volume:
• Minimum: 10 mL
• Ideal: 20 mL
Specimen Storage:
• If the analysis is not performed immediately, store the specimen at
2-8°C for up to 48 hours.
• For longer storage, freeze the specimen at -20°C and ensure it’s
thoroughly mixed before freezing.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Urine specimens that are not properly labeled.
• Specimens with excessive contamination or improper container
use.
• Samples that exceed the recommended storage time.
3. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies
Equipment:
• Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer (ICP-MS)
• Analytical balance
• Centrifuge
• Refrigerator (2-8°C)
• Freezer (-20°C)
Reagents:
• Nitric Acid (trace metal grade)
• Deionized water
• Internal standards for ICP-MS analysis
• Creatinine Reagent Kit
Supplies:
• Collection containers
• Pipettes and tips
• Centrifuge tubes
• Appropriate PPE (gloves, lab coat, eye protection)
4. Procedure
A. Preparation:
1. Sample Receipt and Accessioning:
◦ Ensure all samples are received, documented, and properly
labeled according to laboratory protocol.
◦ Inspect the sample integrity and volume.
◦ Record the date and time of reception.
2. Aliquoting:
◦ Mix the urine specimen thoroughly.
◦ Aliquot approximately 5 mL of urine into a labeled centrifuge
tube for heavy metal analysis.
◦ Aliquot another 5 mL for creatinine measurement, if
necessary.
B. Creatinine Analysis (Initial Test):
1. Method:
◦ Utilize an automated analyzer or manual assay for
creatinine analysis as per the manufacturer's instructions
and lab protocol.
◦ Follow standard QC procedures to ensure accuracy.
2. Interpreting Results:
◦ Compare results against the reference ranges provided by
the equipment manufacturer.
3. Documentation:
◦ Record the creatinine concentration in the Laboratory
Information Management System (LIMS).
C. Heavy Metal Analysis:
1. Preparation of Sample for ICP-MS:
◦ Acidify the urine sample aliquoted for heavy metal analysis
with nitric acid (1% v/v).
◦ Mix well and allow to stabilize for at least 30 minutes.
2. ICP-MS Calibration and Analysis:
◦ Calibrate the ICP-MS with certified calibration standards for
relevant heavy metals (e.g., lead, mercury, cadmium).
◦ Include internal standards in sample preparations for drift
correction.
◦ Inject the prepared urine samples into the ICP-MS following
the instrument’s standard operating procedure.
3. Analyzing Results:
◦ Measure concentrations of specific heavy metals.
◦ Calculate the ratio of detected heavy metals to creatinine
levels.
◦ If any heavy metal concentration is above the threshold,
perform reflex testing as per laboratory protocol.
4. Documentation and Reporting:
◦ Document the results in the LIMS.
◦ Verify results accuracy by comparing with control and
reference standards.
◦ Generate a report detailing each heavy metal concentration
and the heavy metal/creatinine ratio.
D. Reflex Testing (if applicable):
1. Procedure:
◦ If any heavy metal concentration exceeds preset thresholds,
prepare for and conduct additional testing as specified.
2. Documentation:
◦ Record results of reflex testing in the LIMS.
5. Quality Control
Internal Quality Controls:
• Perform QC using both high and low-level quality control
materials for creatinine and heavy metals.
• Analyze QC materials at least once per batch of samples.
• Document all QC results and verify against acceptable ranges.
External Quality Controls:
• Participate in an external proficiency testing program for heavy
metals and creatinine analysis.
Maintenance and Calibration:
• Perform routine maintenance and calibration on the ICP-MS and
creatinine analyzers as per manufacturer's guidelines.
• Document all maintenance and calibration activities.
6. Reporting Results
• All results must be reviewed and verified by a qualified
technologist before release.
• Results are automatically transmitted to the LIS and should be
reviewed for accuracy.
• All critical results must be communicated to the ordering physician
following institutional policy.
7. References
• Manufacturer's Instructions for ICP-MS and Automated Analyzer
• CLIA Regulations
• Relevant Clinical Guidelines for Heavy Metal Analysis
This SOP is approved and implemented as of October 2023. It will be
reviewed annually or upon any equipment, reagent, or procedural
changes impacting test performance.
