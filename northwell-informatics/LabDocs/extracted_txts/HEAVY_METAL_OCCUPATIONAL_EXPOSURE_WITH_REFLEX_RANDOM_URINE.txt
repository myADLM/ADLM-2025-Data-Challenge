Heavy Metal Occupational Exposure, With Reflex, Random,
Urine Analysis Procedure
1. PURPOSE
To provide accurate and reliable results for heavy metals (including
but not limited to lead, mercury, cadmium) in urine samples to
monitor occupational exposure. The procedure includes reflex testing
based on initial results to further quantify or ascertain heavy metal
exposure.
2. SPECIMEN
*Preferred/acceptable:*
- Random urine specimen
- Must be collected in a sterile container
- Ideally, 10 mL urine volume should be provided
*Unacceptable:*
- Specimen containers without proper labeling (Patient ID, date, and time of collection)
- Samples arriving more than 48 hours after collection without refrigeration (2-8 °C)
- Containers with visible contamination or leakage
Ensure that the specimen arrives in the laboratory within 48 hours if
unrefrigerated, or within 72 hours if refrigerated.
3. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) or
Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (AAS)
• Certified primary standards for heavy metals
• Quality Control (QC) materials: High and Low concentration levels
• Fume hood for safe handling of chemicals
4. PROCEDURE
**Sample Preparation:**
1. Verify specimen identity against accompanying requisition form.
2. Mix urine sample by gentle inversion to ensure homogeneity.
3. Aliquot appropriate sample volume (minimum 10 mL) into a clean, labeled conical tube.
**Analysis Process:**
1. Pre-treat samples, if necessary, by dilution or acid digestion following the manufacturers’ recommendations.
2. Calibrate the ICP-MS or AAS according to manufacturer's protocols using certified standards.
3. Run calibration verification using QC materials: high and low concentration levels.
- Document QC results and ensure they are within acceptable limits before proceeding.
**Measurement:**
1. Introduce the prepared urine sample to the ICP-MS or AAS.
2. Record the results for the specified heavy metals following instrument protocol.
3. For any analyte exceeding the occupational exposure thresholds, immediately proceed to reflex testing to confirm levels:
- Increase sample replicates and employ secondary confirmation methods (e.g., repeat with different preparation method)
**Interpretation of Results:**
1. Compare results against reference intervals and occupational limits.
2. For borderline or positive results, ensure secondary confirmation has been performed as per reflex protocol.
3. Validate results through internal QC standards and documenting any deviations.
5. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Results are to be automatically transmitted to the Laboratory Information System (LIS) from the instrument.
2. Review and verification by the technologist are essential to ensure accuracy.
3. Any critical results exceeding occupational limits must be communicated immediately to the ordering physician or responsible personnel following laboratory’s critical reporting guidelines.
- For repeated critical values, document all necessary efforts to communicate the results.
**Reference Intervals:**
Refer to specific reference intervals established by national guidelines (e.g., CDC, OSHA) for heavy metals exposure.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
- Run QC samples daily or as indicated by the instrument’s operational protocol.
- Verify that QC results are within acceptable limits before processing patient samples.
- Document all QC activities and maintain records for audits and inspections.
7. METHOD LIMITATIONS
- Refer to specific instrument manuals for limitations on heavy metal quantification.
- Document any interference or discrepancies in sample quality affecting results.
8. SAFETY AND HANDLING
- Follow all laboratory safety protocols for handling heavy metals and urine specimens.
- Use PPE (personal protective equipment) including gloves, lab coats, and protective eyewear when handling specimens and reagents.
- Utilize fume hoods for all procedures involving hazardous chemicals.
