STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP)
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for the technical component of HEG1
immunostain in order to ensure consistent and accurate results for
immunohistochemical analysis. This protocol only details the
technical aspect of staining and does not cover the interpretation of
the results.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of all technical staff at the laboratory to follow
this procedure when performing HEG1 immunostains. It is the
supervisor’s responsibility to ensure that all staff are trained and
competent in this process.
1. EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS REQUIRED
• Microtome
• Water bath (maintained at 40-45°C)
• Positive control tissue
• Xylene
• Ethanol solutions (100%, 95%, 70%, 50%, and distilled water)
• HEG1 primary antibody
• Secondary antibody (conjugated with HRP or AP)
• Antigen retrieval solution
• Blocking buffer
• Detection kit (e.g., DAB or AEC substrate)
• Counterstain (e.g., Hematoxylin)
• Coverslips and mounting medium
• Slide warmer (maintained at 60-65°C)
• Staining racks and coplin jars
• Timer
1. PROCEDURE
A. Tissue Preparation and Sectioning
1. Sectioning the Tissue:
◦ Cut paraffin-embedded tissue blocks into sections of 4-5
microns using a microtome.
◦ Float sections on a water bath maintained at 40-45°C and
collect sections on positively charged slides.
◦ Allow slides to dry either at room temperature for 30 minutes
or on a slide warmer at 60-65°C for 15 minutes.
2. Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
◦ Deparaffinize tissue sections by placing slides in xylene for
5 minutes, three times.
◦ Rehydrate sections by passing them through a graded
ethanol series: 100% ethanol (2x5 minutes), 95% ethanol
(2x3 minutes), 70% ethanol (1x2 minutes), 50% ethanol
(1x2 minutes), and finally rinse in distilled water (2x2
minutes).
B. Antigen Retrieval
• Heat tissue sections in antigen retrieval solution using a pressure
cooker, microwave, or water bath as per manufacturer’s
instructions (usually 10-25 minutes).
• Allow slides to cool for 20 minutes at room temperature, then
rinse in distilled water followed by PBS (2x5 minutes).
C. Blocking Non-specific Binding
• Incubate sections in blocking buffer for 10 minutes to block non-
specific antibody binding sites.
• Drain slides but do not wash.
D. Primary Antibody Incubation
• Dilute the HEG1 primary antibody in accordance with the
datasheet or using validated conditions.
• Apply the primary antibody to the sections and incubate for 30-60
minutes at room temperature or overnight at 4°C.
• Rinse sections in PBS (3x5 minutes).
E. Secondary Antibody Incubation
• Apply appropriate secondary antibody conjugated with HRP or AP
according to manufacturer’s instructions.
• Incubate for 30 minutes at room temperature.
• Rinse sections in PBS (3x5 minutes).
F. Detection and Visualization
• Apply detection reagent (e.g., DAB or AEC substrate) as per
manufacturer's protocol until the desired stain intensity develops.
• Rinse sections in distilled water to stop the reaction.
G. Counterstaining
• Briefly immerse sections in counterstain (e.g., hematoxylin) for
1-2 minutes.
• Rinse in tap water until sections are clear.
• If necessary, blue sections with bluing reagent or by immersing in
running tap water for 5 minutes.
H. Dehydration and Mounting
• Dehydrate sections by sequential immersion in increasing ethanol
concentrations (70%, 95%, 100%) followed by xylene. (1 minute
each).
• Mount coverslips using an appropriate mounting medium.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include a positive control slide in each staining run to ensure
antibody specificity and staining efficacy.
• Review slides under a microscope to ensure adequate staining
and absence of non-specific staining or background.
• Document any deviations from the protocol and rectify with
appropriate corrective action.
1. PROCEDURAL SAFETY
• Use personal protective equipment (PPE) including gloves and
lab coat at all times.
• Handle all reagents and specimens in accordance with laboratory
safety guidelines.
• Dispose of waste in designated biohazard and chemical waste
containers.
1. DOCUMENTATION
• Record all reagent lots and expiration dates.
• Document the date, time, and initials of the personnel performing
the stain.
• Log any issues or deviations encountered during the procedure.
This SOP must be reviewed annually and updated as necessary, with
all updates appropriately documented and communicated to relevant
staff members.
