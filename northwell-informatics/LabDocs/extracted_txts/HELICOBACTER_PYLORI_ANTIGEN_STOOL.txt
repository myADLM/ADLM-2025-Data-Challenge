Protocol for Helicobacter pylori Antigen, Stool Analysis
1. Purpose and Principle
The purpose of this protocol is to detail the procedure for the analysis
of Helicobacter pylori antigen in stool specimens. This non-invasive
test is performed to detect Helicobacter pylori infection, which can
contribute to gastric conditions such as ulcers and gastritis.
1. Specimen Requirements
a. Preferred Specimen: Fresh stool sample collected in a
clean, dry container. The stool should be free from
contaminants such as water, urine, or other substances.
b. Acceptable Specimen: Stool sample preserved in
appropriate transport media, as per manufacturer’s instructions,
if transported from a remote location.
c. Unacceptable Specimen: Specimens with incorrect
labeling, missing collection date/time, specimens mixed with
urine or other contaminants, or specimens that have leaked or
degraded beyond analytical usability.
2. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies
a. Helicobacter pylori Stool Antigen Test Kit b. Pipettes and
disposable tips c. Stool collection containers d. Gloves and
protective equipment e. Timer f. Labeled specimen tubes g.
Waste disposal container h. Controls (positive and negative) i.
Reagent storage containers and refrigerator (as per
manufacturer’s instructions)
3. Procedure
1. Preparation
▪ Validate the test kit expiration date and storage
conditions.
▪ Ensure all reagents and supplies are ready and within
the usable date range.
▪ Perform the necessary quality control checks using the
control materials provided.
2. Sample Preparation
▪ Wear gloves and appropriate protective equipment.
▪ Mix the stool specimen thoroughly.
▪ Using a pipette, collect the required amount of stool
sample as stated by the test manufacturer and transfer
it to the test tube provided in the kit.
3. Test Procedure
▪ Follow the manufacturer's instructions exactly for the
test procedure.
▪ Add the stool sample to the test membrane or reaction
area as instructed.
▪ Add the buffer solution or reagents as per the steps
outlined in the test kit.
▪ Start the timer and incubate the test as required.
▪ Ensure the test has been conducted within the
environmental conditions specified by the
manufacturer (such as temperature and humidity).
4. Reading the Results
▪ Read the results at the designated time interval
specified by the test kit.
▪ Compare the color change or any other indicator with
the reference chart provided by the manufacturer.
▪ Document the results carefully, noting both positive
and negative outcomes.
4. Quality Control
a. Perform quality control checks using positive and negative
controls every time a new batch of the kit is opened. b. Ensure
proper documentation for all quality control activities. c. Take
corrective actions as required if controls do not perform within
the expected ranges.
5. Reporting Results
◦ Record results in the laboratory information system (LIS).
◦ Ensure the report includes patient identification, specimen
identification, date and time of analysis, and the final results.
◦ Verify the results according to site-specific guidelines and
ensure any critical findings are communicated to the
healthcare provider promptly.
6. Reference Intervals
◦ Negative: No Helicobacter pylori antigen detected.
◦ Positive: Helicobacter pylori antigen detected.
7. Limitations
a. False positives may occur due to contamination or
mishandling of specimens. b. False negatives may occur if the
antigen levels are below the detection threshold of the test kit.
c. Refer to the test kit manufacturer’s insert for specific
limitations and considerations on reagent pad performance.

9. Sample Integrity
• Ensure stool samples are free from contaminants and have been
stored correctly if delayed analysis is necessary.
• Use specimens within the appropriate timeframe to avoid
degradation.
1. Safety Considerations
• Follow biosafety guidelines for handling stool specimens.
• Dispose wastes according to laboratory biosafety protocols.
By adhering firmly to this protocol, we ensure consistent and
accurate analysis for Helicobacter pylori antigens in stool specimens,
contributing valuable information for patient diagnosis and
management.
