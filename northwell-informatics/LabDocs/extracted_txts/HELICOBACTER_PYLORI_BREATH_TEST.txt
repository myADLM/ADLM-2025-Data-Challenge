Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase of Generating Results for Helicobacter Pylori
Breath Test
1. PURPOSE:
• To provide a standardized procedure for the laboratory analysis of
Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) breath test samples, ensuring
accurate and reliable results for clinical diagnosis.
2. SCOPE:
• This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel trained to
perform and analyze H. pylori breath tests.
3. RESPONSIBILITY:
• It is the responsibility of designated laboratory technologists to
perform the analysis and ensure adherence to this SOP.
• Laboratory supervisors are responsible for the training of
personnel, verification of results, and ensuring quality control
measures are in place.
4. SPECIMEN HANDLING:
• Ensure that the patient breath samples are collected following the
pre-analytic SOP.
• Verify that the collection tubes are properly labeled with patient
identifiers and that the time of collection is recorded.
5. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS:
• Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) or Infrared
Spectrometer (IR) analyzer.
• Urea breath test kits (including urea solution and collection tubes).
• Quality control materials: Known positive and negative breath test
samples.
6. PROCEDURE:
A) Sample Preparation:
1. Before starting the analysis, ensure the analyzer is calibrated
according to the manufacturer's instructions.
2. Run a quality control check using QC materials to ensure the
system is functioning correctly.
3. Retrieve patient samples and match them with the test
requisition forms.
B) Analysis Using GC-MS or IR:
1. For GC-MS:
◦ Insert the patient's breath sample tube into the sample
injection port of the GC-MS system.
◦ Configure the system as per the manufacturer's instructions
for measuring isotopic ratios of 13C/12C in carbon dioxide.
◦ Initiate the analysis cycle.
2. For IR Spectrometer:
◦ Place the breath sample tube in the IR spectrometer sample
port.
◦ Apply the spectrometer protocols as per manufacturer's
instructions for detecting the presence of 13C-labeled
carbon dioxide.
◦ Start the analysis.
C) Data Collection and Interpretation:
1. After completing the analysis, the system will display the
results, reflecting the ratio of 13C to 12C in the patient breath
samples.
2. Compare the patient results with the predefined cutoff values to
determine the presence or absence of H. pylori.
◦ A significant increase in 13C/12C ratio from baseline
indicates a positive result for H. pylori infection.
7. QUALITY CONTROL:
• Run positive and negative control samples at the start of each day
and after every 10 patient samples to validate the performance of
the instrument.
• Record all QC results in the Quality Control Log. If the results fall
outside acceptable ranges, stop analysis immediately and
troubleshoot according to the manufacturer's guidelines.
8. REPORTING RESULTS:
• Enter patient's test results into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
• Review and verify results before releasing them to ensure
accuracy and compliance with established clinical interpretation
guidelines.
• Flag critical or unexpected results and communicate them
promptly to the requesting physician.
9. DOCUMENTATION:
• Ensure all steps, from sample preparation to result reporting, are
documented in accordance with laboratory protocols.
• Maintain records of all calibrations, QC checks, and patient
results for inspection and quality assurance.
10. TROUBLESHOOTING:
• If a malfunction or irregularity occurs during analysis, refer to the
instrument's troubleshooting guide.
• If unresolved, escalate the issue to the laboratory supervisor or
the instrument manufacturer’s technical support.
11. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
• Patients' adherence to pre-test instructions is crucial for accurate
results.
• Certain conditions such as recent antibiotic or proton pump
inhibitor use may affect the test accuracy.
12. REFERENCES:
• Manufacturer's operation manuals for the GC-MS and IR
spectrometer.
• Latest clinical guidelines on H. pylori infection diagnosis from
relevant health authorities.
This SOP must be reviewed annually or whenever changes in the
testing methodology or guidelines occur. All updates should be
documented and communicated to laboratory personnel.
