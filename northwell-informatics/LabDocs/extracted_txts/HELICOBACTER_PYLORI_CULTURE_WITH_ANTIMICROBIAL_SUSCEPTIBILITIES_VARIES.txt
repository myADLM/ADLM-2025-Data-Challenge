Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Helicobacter pylori Culture with Antimicrobial
Susceptibilities
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to provide standardized procedures for
the cultivation and antimicrobial susceptibility testing of Helicobacter
pylori from clinical specimens. This ensures consistent and reliable
results for the diagnosis and treatment of infections caused by H.
pylori.
2. SCOPE
This SOP is applicable to all microbiology laboratory personnel
involved in processing, culturing, and performing antimicrobial
susceptibility testing on clinical specimens suspected of containing
Helicobacter pylori.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all designated laboratory personnel to follow
the procedures specified in this SOP accurately. It is also their
responsibility to report any deviations or issues encountered during
the procedure to the supervisor immediately.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Gastric biopsy samples or gastric aspirate.
• Specimen Handling: Specimens should be transported to the
laboratory within 2 hours of collection in appropriate transport
media under suitable conditions to prevent drying out. If transport
is delayed, specimens can be stored at 4°C for a maximum of 24
hours.
• Unacceptable Specimens: Specimens not properly labeled,
specimens received more than 24 hours after collection, or
specimens that are dried out.
5. EQUIPMENT, MATERIALS, AND REAGENTS
• Incubators (microaerophilic conditions)
• Helicobacter pylori selective agar plates
• Campylobacter Blood Agar or Skirrow’s medium
• Normal Saline solution (0.85% NaCl)
• Antimicrobial susceptibility test discs or standardized E-tests for
H. pylori
• Standard laboratory microbiology tools (e.g., inoculating loops,
sterile swabs, etc.)
• Antibiotic reagents for susceptibility testing (e.g., metronidazole,
clarithromycin, amoxicillin, tetracycline, levofloxacin)
6. PROCEDURE
6.1 Sample Preparation
a) Place each specimen in a sterile petri dish. b) Add a small amount
of sterile normal saline to moisten the specimen, if necessary. c)
Using a sterile swab, transfer a small portion of the specimen to the
selective agar plate.
6.2 Inoculation and Incubation
a) Using a sterile loop, streak the specimen onto Helicobacter pylori
selective agar plates. b) Incubate the plates in a microaerophilic
environment at 37°C for up to 5-7 days.
6.3 Monitoring Growth
a) Examine the plates daily for up to 7 days for the presence of small,
translucent, greyish colonies typical of Helicobacter pylori. b) Confirm
H. pylori colonies with gram staining showing small, curved, gram-
negative rods.
6.4 Subculturing for Identification/Confirmation
a) Pick isolated colonies and sub-culture on fresh selective media
and non-selective plates to obtain pure cultures. b) Perform
biochemical tests necessary for identification confirmation, such as
urease, catalase, and oxidase tests.
6.5 Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing
a) Prepare a 0.5 McFarland standard suspension of H. pylori in
sterile normal saline. b) Inoculate the suspension onto Mueller-Hinton
agar with 5% aged sheep blood or alternative media appropriate for
H. pylori susceptibility testing. c) Apply antimicrobial susceptibility test
discs or E-tests for H. pylori. d) Incubate the plates under
microaerophilic conditions at 37°C for 3-5 days.
6.6 Reading and Interpretation of Results
a) After incubation, read and measure diameter of inhibition zones for
disc diffusion. b) For E-tests, interpret according to MIC (Minimum
Inhibitory Concentration) breakpoints. c) Record results and interpret
based on Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI)
guidelines or other relevant criteria.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
a) Include quality control strains (e.g., H. pylori ATCC 43504) for both
culturing and susceptibility testing. b) Ensure all media and reagents
are within their expiration date and stored appropriately. c) Document
all quality control results.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
a) Record all findings accurately in the laboratory information system
(LIS). b) Provide a detailed report including identification confirmation
and antimicrobial susceptibility results. c) Alert the requesting
physician of any critical or unusual findings immediately.

10. REVIEW AND REVISION
This SOP should be reviewed annually or whenever there is a
change in the procedure, reagents, or equipment.
