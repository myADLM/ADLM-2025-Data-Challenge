HELICOBACTER PYLORI (H. PYLORI) IMMUNOSTAIN,
TECHNICAL COMPONENT ONLY PROTOCOL
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this protocol is to outline the standard operating
procedures for the technical component of generating Helicobacter
pylori (H. pylori) immunostain results in the laboratory. This protocol
is designed to ensure accurate, reproducible, and timely results for
the detection of H. pylori in clinical specimens.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory personnel to
perform and document the immunostaining procedure according to
this protocol. The supervisor is responsible for ensuring compliance
with the procedure and for troubleshooting any issues that may arise.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred Specimen: - Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE)
tissue block from gastric biopsies.
Unacceptable Specimen: - Specimens that are not properly fixed or
embedded. - Specimens with inadequate tissue for testing. -
Specimens not labeled correctly or with incomplete documentation.
1. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
• Microtome
• Water bath
• Adhesive-coated microscope slides
• Drying oven
• Xylene
• Ethanol (100%, 95%, 70%)
• Distilled water
• Antibody for H. pylori (primary antibody)
• Detection system (e.g., DAB substrate)
• Hematoxylin counterstain
• Mounting medium
• Coverslips
• Positive and negative control slides
1. PROCEDURE
A. Slide Preparation:
1. Sectioning: Cut 4-5 micron thick sections from the FFPE tissue
block using a microtome.
2. Floating: Float sections on a water bath at 40°C and collect
them on adhesive-coated microscope slides.
3. Drying: Place slides in a drying oven at 60°C for at least 1 hour
to ensure proper adhesion of the tissue.
B. Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
1. Deparaffinization: Immerse slides in xylene for 3 changes, 5
minutes each.
2. Rehydration: Rehydrate slides through a series of graded
ethanol solutions (100%, 95%, 70%) for 2 minutes each,
followed by rinsing in distilled water.
C. Antigen Retrieval:
1. Heat-induced epitope retrieval (HIER) method: Place slides in a
citrate buffer (pH 6.0) and heat in a microwave or pressure
cooker for the specified time according to the antibody
manufacturer's instructions.
2. Allow slides to cool to room temperature and rinse in distilled
water.
D. Immunostaining:
1. Blocking: Apply blocking solution to each slide and incubate for
10-15 minutes at room temperature to reduce nonspecific
binding.
2. Primary Antibody: Apply the H. pylori primary antibody to each
slide and incubate according to the manufacturer's
recommended time and temperature.
3. Washing: Rinse slides in PBS or TBS buffer to remove unbound
primary antibody.
4. Detection: Apply the appropriate detection system (e.g.,
secondary antibody and DAB substrate) according to the
manufacturer's protocol.
5. Counterstaining: Counterstain slides with hematoxylin for 1-2
minutes, rinse in water, and then differentiate in 1% acid alcohol
if necessary.
6. Dehydration and Clearing: Dehydrate slides by passing through
increasing concentrations of ethanol (70%, 95%, 100%)
followed by xylene.
7. Mounting: Apply mounting medium and coverslip.
E. Quality Control:
1. Include positive and negative control slides with each batch of
patient samples.
2. Positive control: A known H. pylori-positive tissue section.
3. Negative control: A tissue section treated without the primary
antibody.
4. REPORTING RESULTS
5. Review stained slides under a microscope to identify the
presence or absence of H. pylori.
6. Document findings and verify consistency with control slides.
7. Technical findings are reported to the pathologist for
interpretation.
8. Any discrepancies between the staining pattern and expected
results should be reviewed and resolved before final reporting.
9. TROUBLESHOOTING
10. If staining is weak or absent in the positive control, review the
antigen retrieval step and antibody concentration.
11. If nonspecific staining occurs, optimize blocking steps or adjust
antibody dilutions.
12. Any persistent issues should be documented and reported to
the supervisor for further investigation.
