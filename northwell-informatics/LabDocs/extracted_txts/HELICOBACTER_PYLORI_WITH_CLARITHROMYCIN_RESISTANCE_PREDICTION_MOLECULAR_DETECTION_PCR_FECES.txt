Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) for Helicobacter pylori
with Clarithromycin Resistance Prediction, Molecular Detection,
PCR, Feces
1. PURPOSE To provide a standardized procedure for the detection
of Helicobacter pylori and prediction of clarithromycin resistance
using molecular detection (PCR) in fecal specimens.
2. SCOPE This procedure is applicable to the molecular diagnostics
laboratory and all trained personnel involved in testing for
Helicobacter pylori with clarithromycin resistance prediction using
PCR-based methods.
3. RESPONSIBILITY Laboratory personnel trained in molecular
diagnostics are responsible for performing the test as outlined in this
SOP. It is the responsibility of the lab supervisors to ensure that this
SOP is followed correctly and quality control measures are observed
and documented.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
• Specimen Type: Feces
• Collection Container: Sterile, leak-proof container
• Volume: A sufficient amount to ensure at least 2 grams of stool
• Storage: Specimens should be refrigerated at 2-8°C if they are to
be processed within 72 hours. For longer-term storage,
specimens should be frozen at -20°C or lower.
• Unacceptable Specimens: Specimens that are mixed with urine,
toilet water, or in improper containers; specimens not labeled with
date and time of collection.
5. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• PCR Thermocycler
• DNA extraction kit appropriate for fecal samples
• Helicobacter pylori detection and clarithromycin resistance
prediction PCR kit
• Positive and negative controls
• PCR tubes and caps
• Pipettes and sterile pipette tips
• Vortex mixer
• Centrifuge
6. PROCEDURE 6.1. DNA Extraction:
1. Put on appropriate PPE.
2. Homogenize the stool sample thoroughly by vortexing.
3. Aliquot approximately 200 mg of stool into a bead beating tube.
4. Add the appropriate amount of lysis buffer from the DNA
extraction kit.
5. Vortex thoroughly and incubate at room temperature or
recommended temperature based on the kit instructions.
6. Proceed with the DNA extraction using the kit’s protocol,
ensuring any steps involving centrifugation are performed at
room temperature unless otherwise specified.
6.2. PCR Setup:
1. Prepare the PCR master mix according to the Helicobacter
pylori detection and clarithromycin resistance prediction PCR kit
instructions, including all reactants such as primers, probes,
dNTPs, buffer, and polymerase.
2. Aliquot the required volume of the PCR master mix into each
PCR tube.
3. Add extracted DNA (template) to each tube. Ensure to include
at least one positive control and one negative control per PCR
run.
4. Cap the tubes and mix gently by tapping or briefly vortexing.
Centrifuge briefly to ensure contents are at the bottom of the
tube.
5. Place the tubes into the PCR thermocycler.
6.3. PCR Cycling Conditions:
1. Set the thermocycler according to the optimal cycling conditions
specified in the detection kit instructions, generally including:
◦ Initial denaturation
◦ Multiple cycles of denaturation, annealing, and extension
◦ Final extension
2. Start the run, ensuring the conditions and the cycling
parameters are correctly set.
6.4. Detection and Analysis:
1. After PCR cycling is complete, analyze the PCR products
according to the detection kit instructions.
2. Generally, detection involves fluorescence data collected at
each cycle (real-time PCR) or gel electrophoresis for endpoint
PCR systems.
3. Compare the results from the patient samples against the
control results.
4. For clarithromycin resistance, specific mutations or resistance
markers present in the PCR result should be interpreted as per
the kit guidelines.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include positive and negative controls with each PCR run.
• Document all control results within the appropriate log. Controls
must meet expected outcomes for the run to be considered valid.
• Should controls fail, repeat the run or seek to troubleshoot the
issue before reporting patient results.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Report results according to laboratory policies. Include
interpretations for detection of H. pylori and any identified
clarithromycin resistance mutations.
• Results are to be reviewed and verified by a certified molecular
technologist before releasing to the LIS.
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to the manufacturer’s insert for limitations related to specific
primer and probe sets.
• Cross-reactivity with other bacterial species or suboptimal DNA
extraction may cause false-negative or false-positive results.
