Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Helicobacter pylori with Clarithromycin
Resistance Prediction, Molecular Detection, PCR, Tissue
1. PURPOSE
To outline the standardized procedure for the molecular detection of
Helicobacter pylori and clarithromycin resistance prediction using
PCR technology in tissue specimens. This SOP ensures consistent,
reliable, and accurate results across all testing processes.
Responsibility:
Designated staff are responsible for performing and documenting all
aspects of the PCR procedure, including the setup, execution, and
analysis. Supervisors are responsible for reviewing the results and
ensuring compliance with the SOP.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/Acceptable Specimens:
• Fresh or frozen gastric biopsy tissue stored in sterile containers.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Tissue samples that are not stored in sterile containers.
• Samples with insufficient tissue quantity for analysis.
• Contaminated specimens.
• Samples arriving at the laboratory more than 48 hours after
collection without proper freezing.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• PCR Workstation
• Thermal Cycler
• Nucleic Acid Extraction Kit (e.g., Qiagen)
• PCR Master Mix (e.g., Taq Polymerase, dNTPs, MgCl2)
• Helicobacter pylori specific primers and probes
• Clarithromycin resistance-specific primers and probes
• Sterile PCR tubes and pipette tips
• Centrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Gel electrophoresis apparatus (optional for confirmation)
• DNA Ladder
• Ethidium bromide (or alternative for nucleic acid staining, optional)
1. PROCEDURE
A) Nucleic Acid Extraction:
1. Homogenize the tissue sample thoroughly using mechanical
disruption tools.
2. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for the Nucleic Acid
Extraction Kit.
◦ Add lysis buffer to the homogenized tissue.
◦ Incubate at room temperature for 10 minutes.
◦ Centrifuge to remove debris.
◦ Bind nucleic acids to the provided columns.
◦ Wash the columns with appropriate wash buffers.
◦ Elute the nucleic acids in a clean, sterile tube.
3. Quantify and assess the quality of the extracted DNA using
spectrophotometry.
B) PCR Setup:
1. Prepare the PCR master mix according to the protocol specific
to the primers being used. Include:
◦ DNA polymerase (Taq)
◦ dNTPs
◦ MgCl2
◦ Buffer solution
◦ Helicobacter pylori specific primers and probes
◦ Clarithromycin resistance-specific primers and probes
2. Aliquot the master mix into sterile PCR tubes.
3. Add extracted DNA to each tube.
4. Include positive control (known Helicobacter pylori DNA),
negative control (no DNA template), and blank (water only) in
the PCR run.
C) PCR Amplification:
1. Program the thermal cycler with the following settings:
◦ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 3 minutes
◦ 35 cycles of:
▪ Denaturation: 95°C for 30 seconds
▪ Annealing: 55°C for 30 seconds (adjust based on primer
requirements)
▪ Extension: 72°C for 60 seconds
◦ Final extension: 72°C for 5 minutes
2. Load the PCR tubes into the thermal cycler and initiate the run.
D) Detection:
1. Analyze PCR products using gel electrophoresis:
◦ Prepare a 2% agarose gel.
◦ Load a DNA ladder for size reference.
◦ Load PCR products and run the gel.
◦ Stain and visualize the gel under UV light.
2. Alternatively, use real-time PCR equipment for immediate
detection and quantification.
E) Interpretation:
1. Compare observed bands to the DNA ladder.
2. Identify Helicobacter pylori presence based on band size.
3. Assess clarithromycin resistance based on mutation-specific
band patterns.
F) Documentation and Reporting:
1. Record all observations, including sample ID, PCR conditions,
and results.
2. Verify results with appropriate controls.
3. Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
4. Review results by the supervising technologist.
5. Report findings to the physician or relevant party according to
site-specific guidelines.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
Material:
• Positive Control DNA (Helicobacter pylori)
• Negative Control (Water)
Procedure:
1. Include controls in each PCR run.
2. Validate new batches of primers and reagents using standard
positive and negative controls.
3. Perform regular equipment calibration checks.
4. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Not applicable (presence/absence detection).
