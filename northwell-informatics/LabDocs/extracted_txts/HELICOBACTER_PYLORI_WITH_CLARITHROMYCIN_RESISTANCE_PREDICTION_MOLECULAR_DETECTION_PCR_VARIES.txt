Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Helicobacter pylori
with Clarithromycin Resistance Prediction, Molecular Detection,
PCR
1. PURPOSE To outline the procedure for the molecular detection
of Helicobacter pylori and prediction of Clarithromycin
resistance using Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). This assay
detects DNA presence specific to Helicobacter pylori and
identifies mutations associated with Clarithromycin resistance.
Responsibility: Designated staff perform and document molecular
detection using PCR as defined in this procedure. It is the
responsibility of all staff to identify any deficiencies or errors which
may affect test results and bring them to the attention of a supervisor.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred/Acceptable:
◦ Gastric biopsy samples stored in sterile containers with
transport medium.
◦ Fecal samples collected in sterile containers.
• Unacceptable:
◦ Specimens arriving in the laboratory greater than 24 hours
after collection.
◦ Specimens with insufficient volume for analysis.
◦ Specimens leaking or contaminated.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• PCR Workstation
• Thermocycler
• Micropipettes and sterile tips
• Sterile microcentrifuge tubes
• Gel electrophoresis apparatus
• DNA extraction kits specific for Helicobacter pylori
• PCR master mix
• Specific primers for Helicobacter pylori and mutations associated
with Clarithromycin resistance (e.g., A2142G and A2143G
mutations in 23S rRNA gene)
• Deionized water
• Ethidium bromide or an alternative DNA stain for gel
electrophoresis
1. PROCEDURE
A) DNA Extraction:
1. Gastric biopsy or fecal samples are processed according to
DNA extraction kit instructions.
2. Extracted DNA is quantified and checked for purity using a
spectrophotometer.
B) PCR Amplification:
1. Prepare PCR master mix including specific primers,
nucleotides, Taq polymerase, buffer, and extracted DNA.
2. Set up PCR reactions in microcentrifuge tubes or PCR plates.
3. Run the PCR in the thermocycler using the following cycling
parameters:
◦ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 5 minutes
◦ Denaturation: 95°C for 30 seconds
◦ Annealing: 55-60°C (depending on primers) for 30 seconds
◦ Extension: 72°C for 30 seconds
◦ Final extension: 72°C for 5 minutes
◦ Repeat denaturation, annealing, and extension steps for 35
cycles.
C) Gel Electrophoresis:
1. Prepare agarose gel and electrophoresis buffer.
2. Load PCR products into the gel wells along with a DNA ladder.
3. Run electrophoresis at 100V for approximately 45 minutes.
4. Visualize the DNA bands under UV light following staining with
ethidium bromide or alternative DNA stain.
D) Interpretation:
1. Compare the PCR product bands to the DNA ladder to confirm
the presence of Helicobacter pylori-specific bands.
2. Assess the presence of mutation bands indicating
Clarithromycin resistance.
3. Document all findings including sample ID, PCR batch number,
gel image, and interpretation of results.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
Maintain internal quality controls including positive and negative
controls with each batch of PCR to validate the results. Document
validation and any corrective actions taken.
1. RESULTS REPORTING
Results are documented, reviewed, and verified by the designated
staff. Positive results for Helicobacter pylori and identification of
Clarithromycin resistance mutations are reported according to site-
specific guidelines. If results show any discrepancy or very rare
genetic patterns, further testing may be required.
Reference Intervals:
• Presence of Helicobacter pylori-specific DNA band
• Presence of Clarithromycin resistance-associated mutation bands
(A2142G/A2143G)
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to manufacturers' product inserts for individual reagent
limitations. PCR reaction conditions and primer specificity may limit
detection accuracy.
