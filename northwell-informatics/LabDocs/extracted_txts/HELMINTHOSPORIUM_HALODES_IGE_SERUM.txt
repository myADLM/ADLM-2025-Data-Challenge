Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical
Phase of Generating Results for HELMINTHOSPORIUM
HALODES, IGE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
To provide a systematic and detailed approach for the identification
and quantification of Helminthosporium halodes-specific IgE in serum
samples.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing
the analysis according to the procedures listed in this SOP.
• The supervisory staff is responsible for ensuring that the
procedures are followed and documented accurately.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred Specimen: Serum obtained from a Red-top tube
(serum collection tube without anticoagulants).
• Volume Required: Minimum 0.5 mL serum.
• Stability:
◦ Room Temperature: Stable for up to 8 hours.
◦ Refrigerated (2-8°C): Stable for up to 48 hours.
◦ Frozen (-20°C or lower): Stable for up to 1 month. Avoid
repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
• Unacceptable Specimen: Hemolyzed, icteric, or lipemic
samples. Samples stored at non-validated temperatures beyond
the specified stability period.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Equipment:
◦ Centrifuge (for serum separation)
◦ Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) reader
(capable of reading absorbance at 450 nm with a reference
filter of 620-650 nm)
◦ Pipettes and Pipette Tips
◦ Incubator (37°C)
◦ Wash bottle or automated plate washer
◦ Microplate reader
• Reagents:
◦ Helminthosporium halodes-specific IgE ELISA Kit (ensure that
the kit is within its expiration date)
◦ Calibrators and Controls included in the ELISA kit
◦ Substrate solution
◦ Stop solution
1. PROCEDURE
Sample Preparation:
1. Centrifuge the blood sample at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes to
separate serum.
2. Carefully transfer the serum to a clean, labeled tube while
avoiding transferring any cellular components.
ELISA Procedure:
1. Bring all reagents and samples to room temperature before
starting the assay.
2. Prepare the required number of microplate wells as instructed
by the ELISA kit manual.
3. Add the patient serum sample, calibrators, and controls to the
assigned wells (typically 100 µL per well).
4. Incubate the plate at 37°C for the time specified in the ELISA kit
manual (commonly 1 hour).
5. Wash the plate thoroughly with the wash buffer provided in the
kit (typically 5 washes recommended).
6. Add the enzyme conjugate to each well and incubate at 37°C
for the specified time.
7. Wash the plate again as instructed.
8. Add the substrate solution to each well and incubate in the dark
at room temperature for the specified time.
9. Add the stop solution to each well to terminate the reaction.
10. Read the absorbance of each well at 450 nm within 30 minutes
using the microplate reader (subtract the readings at 620-650
nm to correct for optical imperfections).
11. QUALITY CONTROL
12. Run both positive and negative controls provided in the ELISA
kit with each batch of samples to ensure assay performance.
13. If the controls do not fall within the specified range, the assay
should be considered invalid, and troubleshooting steps should
be followed as stated in the ELISA kit manual.
14. REPORTING RESULTS
• Calculate the concentrations of Helminthosporium halodes-
specific IgE in the serum samples using the calibration curve
generated from the standard calibrators.
• Validate and cross-check the results for any discrepancies or
unusual trends.
• Review and verify the results, ensuring they fall within expected
ranges before reporting.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• The interpretation of the results should be defined in consultation
with medical guidelines and the ranges provided in the ELISA kit
insert.
• Negative: < 0.35 kU/L
• Borderline: 0.35 - 0.7 kU/L
• Positive: > 0.7 kU/L
1. LIMITATIONS
• Results should be interpreted within the clinical context of patient
history and other diagnostic tests.
• Potential cross-reactivity with other allergens may lead to false-
positive results and should be considered during diagnosis.

specific IgE.

1. DOCUMENTATION
• Record all instrument settings, patient results, and QC results in
the laboratory information system (LIS).
ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH AND SAFETY
• Conduct procedures requiring blood or serum handling in
designated biosafety areas.
• Follow universal precautions, wearing appropriate personal
protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves and lab coats.
• Dispose of biological waste and sharps in appropriate labeled
containers according to the institutional and regulatory guidelines.
END OF SOP
This SOP should be reviewed and updated on an annual basis or as
required by changes in technology, regulations, or laboratory
standards.
