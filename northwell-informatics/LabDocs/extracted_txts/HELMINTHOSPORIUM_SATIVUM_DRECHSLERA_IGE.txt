Analytical Phase SOP for Generating Results for
Helminthosporium sativum/Drechslera IgE
1. PURPOSE
To outline the standard operating procedures for the analytical phase
of generating results for Helminthosporium sativum/Drechslera (H.
sativum/Drechslera) specific IgE antibody testing, ensuring accurate
and reliable results.
Responsibility:
Designated trained laboratory personnel are responsible for
performing the analytical steps in this protocol. It is the responsibility
of the laboratory supervisor to ensure that all personnel adhere to
this SOP and that all quality control measures are followed.
1. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• H. sativum/Drechslera specific IgE assay kit
• Microtiter plates
• Wash buffer
• Diluent
• Enzyme conjugate
• Substrate solution
• Stop solution
• Controls (positive and negative)
• Calibrators
• Sample wells
• Micropipettes and tips
• Plate reader capable of measuring optical density at the required
wavelength
• Laboratory timer
• Laboratory notebook or results recording software
1. EQUIPMENT
• Incubator set at 37°C
• Refrigerated centrifuge
• Plate washer
• Microplate reader (with ELISA software)
1. SAMPLE REQUIREMENTS
• Serum samples should be used for this assay.
• Samples should be collected, labelled, and stored appropriately
prior to testing (refer to specimen collection protocol).
• Samples should be stored at 2-8°C for short-term storage or at
-20°C for long-term storage.
• Ensure samples are at room temperature before beginning the
assay.
1. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation
1. Allow all reagents and samples to come to room temperature
before use.
2. Prepare microtiter plates and sample wells according to the
assay kit instructions.
3. Label wells and include controls and calibrators as specified in
the kit insert.
B) Sample and Reagent Addition
1. Pipette the calibrators into designated wells according to the
assay kit protocol.
2. Add the serum samples into the sample wells as instructed.
3. Add the diluent to each well as required by the kit.
4. Mix gently by tapping the side of the plate.
C) Incubation
1. Incubate the plate at 37°C for the period specified in the assay
kit (typically 1 hour) to allow antibody binding.
D) Wash Steps
1. Wash the plate as instructed (usually 4-5 wash cycles) using
the plate washer. Ensure complete removal of wash buffer after
each cycle.
E) Enzyme Conjugate Addition
1. Add the enzyme conjugate to each well.
2. Mix gently and incubate at room temperature in the dark as per
the kit instructions.
F) Substrate Reaction
1. Following incubation, wash the plate again (usually 4-5 wash
cycles).
2. Add the substrate solution to each well.
3. Incubate at room temperature in the dark until color
development is sufficient, as per the kit instructions.
G) Stopping the Reaction
1. Add stop solution to each well when color development is
adequate.
H) Reading the Results
1. Read the optical density at the required wavelength using the
plate reader.
2. Record the readings as per laboratory guidelines.
3. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
A) Controls
1. Confirm that the positive and negative controls fall within the
expected ranges.
2. Validate assay performance based on controls and calibrators.
B) Patient Samples
1. Compare optical density readings of patient samples to the
calibrator curve.
2. Convert optical density readings into concentration units based
on the calibrator curve or manufacturer’s best practice
guidelines.
3. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform quality control checks regularly including assessment of
controls, reagents, and instruments.
• Document all quality control activities and results.
• Investigate and resolve any discrepancies in quality control
outcomes prior to reporting patient results.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• All results must be reviewed and signed off by a qualified
laboratory supervisor.
• Report results using the laboratory information system, ensuring
that results are transmitted to the correct physician or clinic.
• Reference intervals and interpretive data should be included in
the report.
1. PROCEDURAL NOTES
• Follow all biosafety protocols when handling biological samples.
• Ensure all equipment is calibrated and maintained according to
manufacturer specifications.
• Document each step and any deviations from the standard
protocol in the laboratory notebook.
