Standard Operating Protocol (SOP) for Hematologic Disorders –
Chromosome Analysis
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the protocol for the analytical phase of
generating results for hematologic disorders through
chromosome analysis, ensuring that all procedures are followed
meticulously to provide accurate and reliable test results.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for following this
SOP, performing the analysis, documenting each step of the
procedure, and adhering to quality control measures.
1. DEFINITION
Chromosome analysis in hematologic disorders involves
comprehensive cytogenetic studies typically performed on bone
marrow, blood, or other tissue samples. This protocol focuses on
preparations, analyses, including metaphase spread preparation,
staining, microscopic analysis, and karyotyping.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Acceptable Specimens:
• Bone marrow aspirates collected in heparinized syringes.
• Peripheral blood collected in sodium heparin tubes.
• Tissue biopsy samples in sterile transport media.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens collected in EDTA or any other anticoagulants not
specified.
• Clotted blood samples.
• Specimens without proper labeling and documentation.
1. EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS REQUIRED
• Sterile culture flasks or plates
• Maintenance media for cell cultures (RPMI 1640, FBS, antibiotics)
• Colcemid or another mitotic inhibitor
• Hypotonic solution (e.g., 0.075 M KCl)
• Fixative solution (3:1 methanol-acetic acid)
• Microscope slides
• Staining agents (Giemsa stain, trypsin)
• Phase contrast microscope equipped for fluorescence and
karyotyping analysis
• Karyotyping software
1. PROCEDURE
A. Culture Setup and Harvesting:
1. Preparation:
◦ In a biosafety cabinet, add the specimen to the appropriate
culture medium in sterile culture flasks or plates.
◦ Incubate the cultures at 37°C with 5% CO2 for 24-72 hours
depending on the specimen type.
2. Colcemid Arrest:
◦ Add Colcemid solution to the culture to arrest cells in
metaphase. Incubate for 15-30 minutes, ensuring to
optimize the time based on cell type and growth conditions.
3. Harvesting:
◦ Centrifuge culture flasks at 1000 rpm for 10 minutes.
◦ Discard the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in pre-
warmed hypotonic KCl solution.
◦ Incubate at 37°C for 20 minutes.
4. Fixation:
◦ Centrifuge the hypotonic solution, discard the supernatant,
and resuspend the cell pellet in freshly prepared fixative
solution.
◦ Repeat the fixation step twice more to ensure complete
fixation of cells.
B. Slide Preparation and Staining:
1. Slide Preparation:
◦ Drop the fixed cell suspension onto clean, chilled
microscope slides. Allow slides to air dry completely.
2. Banding/Staining:
◦ Treat slides with trypsin for G-banding, then rinse with
buffer.
◦ Stain with Giemsa solution for 3-5 minutes, rinse slides with
distilled water, and air dry.
C. Microscopic Analysis and Karyotyping:
1. Metaphase Analysis:
◦ Under a phase contrast microscope, identify and capture
metaphase spreads. Select well-spread chromosomes
without overlap or scattering.
2. Karyotyping:
◦ Analyze at least 20 metaphases per specimen. Identify and
arrange chromosomes based on size, banding pattern, and
centromere position using karyotyping software.
◦ Prepare detailed karyograms for diagnostic interpretation.
3. QUALITY CONTROL:
◦ Ensure all reagents and media are within expiration dates.
◦ Set up concurrent negative controls (unstimulated cultures)
to check for contamination.
◦ Perform routine calibration of analytical instruments.
◦ Administer proficiency testing by comparing results with
verified reference standards.
4. REPORTING RESULTS:
◦ Document all laboratory findings in the patient’s record.
◦ Report karyotype results in ISCN (International System for
Human Cytogenetic Nomenclature) format.
◦ Ensure all reports are reviewed and authorized by a certified
clinical cytogeneticist before releasing results. Confirm any
abnormal findings through discussion with a pathologist or
hematologist if necessary.

as per institutional guidelines and regulations for laboratory safety,
quality control, and confidentiality.
This SOP ensures accuracy and consistency in the analysis and
reporting processes for chromosome studies in hematologic
disorders, aiming for high standards in clinical laboratory diagnostics.
