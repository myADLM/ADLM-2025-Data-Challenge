Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Generating Results for
Hematologic Disorders, DNA and RNA Extraction and Holding,
Varies
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to establish standardized procedures for
the extraction, handling, and initial processing of DNA and RNA from
hematologic disorder specimens. The procedure ensures accurate
and reliable data generation and specimen management to support
clinical diagnostics and research.
1. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel involved in the
DNA and RNA extraction process for hematologic disorder
specimens.
1. DEFINITIONS
• Hematologic Disorders: Diseases related to blood or blood-
forming tissues. This includes but is not limited to leukemias,
lymphomas, and myelodysplastic syndromes.
• Extraction: The process of isolating DNA or RNA from a given
sample.
• Specimen Hold: The proper storage of extracted nucleic acids
until further analysis is required.
1. RESPONSIBILITIES
• Designated Lab Personnel: Perform DNA and RNA extractions,
ensure all equipment is calibrated and maintained, and document
each step.
• Supervisors: Oversee the procedure, ensure compliance with the
SOP, address deviations, and validate instruments and reagents.

1. PROCEDURE
6.1. DNA Extraction:
1. Sample Preparation
◦ Label a 2.0 mL microcentrifuge tube for each sample.
◦ Add an appropriate volume (200-300 µL) of each sample to
the tube.
2. Lysis
◦ Add 20 µL of Proteinase K and 200 µL of lysis buffer to the
sample.
◦ Vortex briefly to mix and incubate at 56°C for 20-30 minutes,
ensuring complete lysis.
3. Binding
◦ Add 200 µL of ethanol (100%) to the lysate.
◦ Vortex briefly to mix thoroughly.
4. Column Binding
◦ Transfer the lysate to the silica column provided in the kit.
◦ Centrifuge at 12,000 x g for 1 minute. Discard flow-through
and place the column back into the collection tube.
5. Washing
◦ Add 500 µL of wash buffer to the column.
◦ Centrifuge at 12,000 x g for 1 minute. Discard flow-through.
◦ Repeat the wash step.
6. Elution
◦ Place the column in a clean 1.5 mL tube.
◦ Add 50-100 µL of elution buffer (pre-warmed to 60°C) to the
center of the column membrane.
◦ Incubate at room temperature for 1 minute and then
centrifuge at 12,000 x g for 1 minute.
6.2. RNA Extraction:
1. Sample Preparation
◦ Label a 2.0 mL microcentrifuge tube for each sample.
◦ Add an appropriate volume (200-300 µL) of each sample to
the tube.
2. Lysis and Homogenization
◦ Add 750 µL of lysis buffer containing guanidine
isothiocyanate and β-mercaptoethanol (optional) to the
sample.
◦ Vortex thoroughly for 30 seconds.
3. Phase Separation
◦ Add 150 µL of phenol-chloroform to the lysate.
◦ Vortex vigorously for 15 seconds and incubate at room
temperature for 2-3 minutes.
◦ Centrifuge at 12,000 x g for 10 minutes at 4°C.
◦ Carefully transfer the aqueous phase (top layer) to a new
tube.
4. RNA Precipitation
◦ Add an equal volume of 100% isopropanol to the aqueous
phase.
◦ Mix gently by inverting the tube several times.
◦ Incubate at -20°C for at least 1 hour or overnight.
5. RNA Pelleting
◦ Centrifuge at 12,000 x g for 10 minutes at 4°C.
◦ Discard the supernatant and wash the RNA pellet with 1 mL
of 70% ethanol.
◦ Centrifuge again at 12,000 x g for 5 minutes at 4°C. Discard
the ethanol and air-dry the RNA pellet.
6. RNA Resuspension
◦ Resuspend the RNA pellet in 20-50 µL of RNase-free water.
◦ Store at -80°C until further use.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Verify the integrity and purity of extracted DNA and RNA using
NanoDrop or a similar spectrophotometer to check the A260/A280
ratio.
• Document all observations and measurements in the extraction
log.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results and quality control data should be reviewed and verified
by the designated technologist.
• Anomalies or deviations should be reported to the supervisor
immediately and documented accordingly.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Not applicable for extraction phase. Results will depend on
subsequent analytical assays.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to extraction kit inserts for specific limitations. Ensure all
reagents and instruments are within their calibration and expiration
dates.
1. DOCUMENTATION
• All activities must be recorded in the laboratory information
system (LIS).
• Maintain comprehensive records of reagent lot numbers, expiry
dates, and calibration data for all equipment used.
