Standard Operating Procedure: Analytical Phase of Generating
Results for Hematologic Disorders, DNA Extract, and Hold, Varies
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is to define
the process for analytical procedures associated with generating
results for hematologic disorders through DNA extraction and holding
for variable tests. This document ensures the integrity and accuracy
of the analyses performed on DNA samples obtained for evaluating
hematologic disorders.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory personnel or technologists are responsible for
performing the analytical procedures as defined in this SOP. It is the
responsibility of all laboratory staff to ensure accuracy, log results
appropriately, and report any inconsistencies to supervisors.
Supervisors must ensure that the procedures are adequately
followed, performance is evaluated, and corrective actions are
implemented when necessary.
1. DEFINITION
DNA Extraction: The process of isolating DNA from cellular material
collected from the patient. Holding: Storing the extracted DNA under
conditions that preserve its integrity for subsequent testing.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Types: Whole blood, bone marrow aspirates, or other
relevant samples collected in EDTA or other appropriate
anticoagulants. Acceptable Volume: Typically, 3-5 mL of blood or 1-2
mL of bone marrow aspirate. Unacceptable Specimens: Hemolyzed,
clotted, or insufficient samples are not acceptable for DNA extraction.
1. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
Lysis buffer Ethanol (70% and 100%) Proteinase K DNA extraction
kits (e.g., Qiagen, Roche) Sterile microcentrifuge tubes (1.5 mL and
2.0 mL) Tube racks Centrifuges (compatible with microcentrifuge
tubes) Pipettes and pipette tips Thermomixers or water baths Vortex
mixers
1. PROCEDURE
A. DNA Extraction
1. Sample Preparation: i. Label all specimens with patient
information and accession numbers. ii. Ensure that the
specimens are appropriately stored and brought to room
temperature prior to processing.
2. Cell Lysis: i. Add 200 µL of lysis buffer to 200 µL of whole blood
or bone marrow aspirate in a 2.0 mL microcentrifuge tube. ii.
Vortex to mix thoroughly.
3. Protein Digestion: i. Add 20 µL of Proteinase K to the lysate. ii.
Incubate the mixture at 56°C for 30-60 minutes in a
thermomixer or water bath with occasional vortexing.
4. DNA Precipitation: i. Add 200 µL of ethanol (100%) to the
sample, mix thoroughly by vortexing. ii. Transfer the mixture to
a spin column provided in the DNA extraction kit.
5. Washing: i. Wash the column with appropriately buffered wash
buffers (usually provided with the DNA extraction kit) following
the manufacturer’s instructions.
6. Elution: i. Elute the DNA with 100 µL of the elution buffer
provided by the kit or with a TE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 0.1 mM
EDTA, pH 8.0). ii. Collect the eluted DNA in clean, labeled 1.5
mL microcentrifuge tubes.
B. DNA Holding
1. Storage: i. Store the extracted DNA at -20°C for short-term
storage. ii. For long-term storage, keep the DNA at -80°C. iii.
Ensure proper labeling of all storage tubes with patient
information, date, and type of sample.
2. Monitoring: i. Regularly check storage conditions to ensure that
they are within the required range. ii. Implement backup storage
strategies to prevent any impact from equipment failure.
C. Quality Control
1. Internal Control: i. Include negative and positive control
samples during each batch of extraction to ensure the efficiency
and reliability of the extraction process. ii. Document the
controls and retain records as per laboratory guidelines.
2. Performance Evaluation: i. Evaluate the quality of the extracted
DNA by measuring its concentration and purity using a
spectrophotometer (A260/280 ratio should be approximately
1.8). ii. Record all findings and ensure any discrepancies are
reported and addressed.
3. REPORTING RESULTS
4. Documentation: i. Log all processed samples and
corresponding DNA concentrations and purity measurements in
the laboratory information system (LIS).
5. Result Logging: i. Record additional details such as dates of
extraction, storage conditions, and any anomalies observed
during the process.
6. Verification: i. The results should be reviewed by a qualified
technologist or supervisor to ensure compliance with quality
standards before reporting.
7. Confidentiality: i. Ensure that all patient information and test
results remain confidential, accessible only to authorized
personnel.

use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE).
• Update the SOP periodically to incorporate new techniques,
equipment, or revisions based on current best practices in
molecular diagnostics.
