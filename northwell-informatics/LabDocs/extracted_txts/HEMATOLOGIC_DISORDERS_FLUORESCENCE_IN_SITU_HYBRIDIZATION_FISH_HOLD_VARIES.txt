Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating FISH Results for Hematologic Disorders
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the standardized procedure for
performing Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) testing for
hematologic disorders. This document ensures the accuracy,
reliability, and timeliness of test results, in compliance with regulatory
requirements and quality standards.
Responsibility: This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel
trained and qualified to perform FISH analysis for hematologic
disorders. It is the responsibility of all staff to follow the procedures as
outlined and to report any deviations or issues to the designated
supervisor.
1. DEFINITIONS
Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH): A molecular cytogenetic
technique that uses fluorescent probes to hybridize specific DNA
sequences on chromosomes. It is used to detect and localize the
presence or absence of specific DNA sequences and to evaluate the
number or structural changes of chromosomes.
Hematologic Disorders: Medical conditions affecting the blood, bone
marrow, and lymphatic systems, including but not limited to leukemia,
lymphoma, and myeloma.
1. EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS
3.1 Equipment:
• Fluorescence microscope with appropriate filter sets
• Hybridization chamber
• Thermocycler or hybridization oven
• Incubator
• Microcentrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Pipettes and tips
• Humidity control system
3.2 Reagents and Supplies:
• Fluorescently labeled DNA probes specific to hematologic
disorders
• 20x SSC buffer (Saline-Sodium Citrate)
• Ethanol series (70%, 85%, 99%)
• Formamide
• Triton X-100
• DAPI (4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) counterstain
• Sample slides
• Coverslips
• Immersion oil specific for fluorescence microscopy
• Glassware and disposable materials
1. PROCEDURE
4.1 Specimen Preparation:
• Ensure the specimens (bone marrow aspirates, peripheral blood
smears, etc.) are received and accessioned according to the
laboratory’s standard procedures.
• Prepare cytospin slides or smear preparations as necessary.
4.2 Probe Preparation:
• Pre-warm the hybridization oven or thermocycler to 73°C.
• Dilute the appropriate FISH probes as specified by the
manufacturer’s instructions.
• Pre-denature the FISH probe by heating at 73°C for 5 minutes,
followed by placement on ice.
4.3 Pretreatment of Slides:
• Fix slides in 99% ethanol for 10 minutes at room temperature.
• Air dry the slides.
• Immerse slides in 2x SSC buffer at 73°C for 2 minutes.
• Wash slides in distilled water for 5 minutes.
• Place slides in a pre-warmed hybridization chamber or
hybridization oven.
4.4 Hybridization:
• Apply 10µl of the pre-warmed FISH probe mixture to each slide.
• Cover the area with a 22x22 mm coverslip and seal with rubber
cement.
• Perform denaturation at 73°C for 5 minutes, then transfer the
slides to a humidified chamber and incubate at 37°C overnight
(14-20 hours).
4.5 Post-Hybridization Wash:
• Remove the rubber cement and coverslip.
• Wash the slides in 0.4x SSC/0.3% NP-40 at 73°C for 2 minutes.
• Wash the slides in 2x SSC/0.1% NP-40 at room temperature for 1
minute.
• Counterstain with DAPI by applying 10µl to each slide, followed
by a coverslip.
4.6 Microscopy and Analysis:
• Analyze the slides using a fluorescence microscope with the
appropriate filter sets.
• Scan the sample area and capture images of hybridization
signals.
• Interpret the FISH results by assessing the signal patterns and
recording the number and arrangement of the fluorescent signals
as per diagnostic criteria for specific hematologic disorders.
4.7 Documentation and Reporting:
• Document the FISH results including the chromosome or gene
region(s) assessed, probe used, signal pattern observed, and any
abnormalities detected.
• Compare the FISH results with clinical information and other
laboratory findings.
• Report the diagnostic findings in the laboratory information
system (LIS) and ensure timely communication with the
requesting clinician.
4.8 Quality Control:
• Perform positive and negative control hybridizations with each
batch of FISH assays to ensure assay reliability.
• Ensure periodic calibration and maintenance of fluorescence
microscopy equipment.
• Regularly verify the performance of FISH probes with known
control samples.
• Follow internal and external quality assurance protocols.
1. LIMITATIONS AND PRECAUTIONS
• FISH assay sensitivity may be affected by probe quality,
hybridization conditions, and specimen quality.
• Interpret results with caution in cases of poor hybridization or low
signal strength.
• Ensure appropriate safety measures, including the use of
protective equipment and proper disposal of hazardous materials.

• Manufacturer’s package inserts for specific FISH probe kits.
• Laboratory quality assurance and safety manuals.
• Relevant clinical guidelines and scientific literature on FISH
analysis for hematologic disorders.

This SOP provides a comprehensive procedural guide for performing
FISH analysis for hematologic disorders in a CLIA-certified medical
laboratory. All laboratory personnel engaging in FISH testing should
be adequately trained and adhere to this protocol to ensure the
accuracy and reliability of results.
