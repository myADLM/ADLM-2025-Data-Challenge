Standard Operating Procedure: Analytical Phase for Hematologic
Disorders, Leukemia/Lymphoma; Flow Cytometry
1. Purpose
This procedure defines the process for the analytical phase of flow
cytometry for hematologic disorders, including leukemia and
lymphoma. Our objective is to ensure accurate and timely analysis of
samples to provide reliable results that will inform patient diagnosis
and treatment.
1. Scope
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel involved in performing
flow cytometry in diagnosing hematologic disorders, including
leukemia and lymphoma.
1. Responsibilities
• Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for conducting
and documenting the analysis.
• The laboratory supervisor or designated pathologist will review
and validate the results and take necessary corrective actions if
needed.
1. Specimen Requirements
• Specimen types: Peripheral blood, bone marrow aspirate, lymph
node biopsy, or other tissues as indicated.
• Specimens should be collected in EDTA or heparin tubes and
transported to the laboratory as soon as possible.
• Specimens should be kept at room temperature and processed
within 24 hours of collection.
1. Equipment and Reagents
• Flow Cytometer (e.g., BD FACSCanto, BD LSRFortessa, etc.)
• Calibrated pipettes and tips
• Control beads (e.g., BD Calibrite)
• Fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies specific to target antigens
(e.g., CD markers)
• Lysing solution (e.g., BD FACS Lysing Solution)
• FACS tubes (with caps)
• PBS buffer
• Automated system for data analysis (e.g., FlowJo, Kaluza)
1. Quality Control
• Perform daily calibration of the flow cytometer using standard
control beads to ensure proper instrument performance.
• Run isotype controls and fluorescence-minus-one (FMO) controls
for each set of samples analyzed.
• Record all quality control data and initiate troubleshooting if
control values are out of the acceptable ranges.
1. Procedure
A. Sample Preparation i. Confirm patient identity and label FACS
tubes with unique identifiers. ii. Aliquot 100 µL of whole blood or bone
marrow aspirate into each labeled FACS tube. iii. Add appropriate
volume of fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies to each tube
according to the panel design. iv. Vortex gently and incubate in the
dark at room temperature for 15-30 minutes. v. Add 2 mL of lysing
solution to each tube to lyse red blood cells. vi. Vortex gently and
incubate for 10 minutes at room temperature. vii. Centrifuge the
tubes at 300 x g for 5 minutes and discard the supernatant. viii.
Resuspend the cell pellet in PBS buffer (1 to 2 mL) and store in the
dark until ready for analysis.
B. Flow Cytometer Setup i. Turn on the flow cytometer and perform
daily startup quality control (QC) using control beads. ii. Set up
compensation controls using single-stained control samples to adjust
for spectral overlap between fluorochromes. iii. Verify that the flow
cytometer settings are optimized for the specific antibody panel being
used.
C. Data Acquisition i. Load control and patient samples sequentially
into the flow cytometer. ii. Acquire at least 10,000 events per tube,
ensuring consistent sample introduction for accurate analysis. iii.
Monitor the acquisition process and make adjustments as needed to
maintain data quality. iv. Record the flow cytometry data onto the
laboratory information system (LIS).
D. Data Analysis i. Use appropriate software (e.g., FlowJo or Kaluza)
to analyze the data, applying gating strategies defined by the
laboratory. ii. Identify cell populations of interest, including leukemic
or lymphoma cell populations, using specific antigen markers. iii.
Compare findings against established reference ranges and criteria
for hematologic disorders.
1. Reporting Results
• Record and transmit results to the LIS, ensuring accurate entry of
all relevant data.
• Include interpretive comments based on the findings, such as cell
population percentages and abnormal phenotypes.
• Results require review and validation by a designated pathologist
or laboratory supervisor before release.
1. Reference Intervals
• Reference intervals for specific markers and populations should
be based on guidelines provided by the Clinical and Laboratory
Standards Institute (CLSI) and the latest hematology reference
texts.
1. TroubleShooting
• If QC fails, investigate possible causes such as reagent issues,
instrument problems, or user error, and take corrective actions as
needed.
• If sample integrity is compromised, request a new sample
collection.
1. Documentation
• Maintain all records of QC, calibration, sample preparation, data
acquisition, and analysis according to laboratory policies and
CLIA regulations.
• Store related documents securely and accessibly for retrospective
review or in case of audits.
1. References
• Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines for
flow cytometry.
• Manufacturer's instructions for equipment and reagents used.
• Hematology reference texts for diagnostic criteria and reference
intervals.
By meticulously following this SOP, the laboratory ensures consistent,
accurate, and timely generation of results, which are crucial for
diagnosing and managing hematologic disorders, including leukemia
and lymphoma.
