SOP: Analytical Phase for Generating Results for Hematologic
Molecular Algorithm
1. PURPOSE
To establish standardized procedures for analyzing hematologic
molecular tests and reporting results accurately, ensuring quality
control and reliability of the results.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing
hematologic molecular tests, documenting procedures, and ensuring
the accuracy and reliability of testing processes.
1. DEFINITION
Hematologic molecular tests refer to diagnostic tests that analyze
nucleic acids, such as DNA and RNA, to detect genetic mutations,
chromosomal abnormalities, or changes in gene expression
associated with hematologic disorders.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Acceptable specimens: EDTA anticoagulated blood, bone marrow
aspirates or biopsies.
• Unacceptable specimens: Hemolyzed samples, clotted
specimens, or samples received in incorrect anticoagulants.
All specimens should be labeled with the patient's identification,
collection date, and time. Transport specimens immediately to the
laboratory at 2-8°C or per specific test requirements.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Real-time PCR (RT-PCR) instruments
• Sequencing instruments (e.g., next-generation sequencing)
• Reagents for nucleic acid extraction, amplification, and
sequencing
• Control and calibration materials
• Personal protective equipment
1. PROCEDURE
A) Nucleic Acid Extraction:
1. Prepare the specimen by mixing gently to avoid hemolysis.
2. Follow the manufacturer’s protocol for nucleic acid extraction
using the appropriate extraction kit.
3. Quantify the extracted nucleic acids for quality and
concentration analysis.
B) Quantitative PCR:
1. Prepare the master mix and add appropriate primers and
probes.
2. Load samples and controls into the PCR plate or tubes.
3. Run the PCR program as specified by the test kit.
4. Analyze the amplification curves to determine the presence of
specific mutations or gene expression levels.
C) Sequencing:
1. Prepare the sequencing library according to the manufacturer’s
protocol.
2. Perform sequencing using next-generation sequencers.
3. Analyze the sequencing data using bioinformatics tools and
software to detect mutations and variants.
D) Data Interpretation:
1. Compare the test results to control standards and reference
databases.
2. Verify the results with secondary analysis or repeat testing if
necessary.
3. Consult with a supervising technologist or pathologist for
complex cases or ambiguous results.
E) Quality Control:
1. Regularly run positive and negative controls to validate
accuracy.
2. Record and monitor Quality Control (QC) results, taking
corrective action as necessary.
3. Ensure all equipment is calibrated and maintained according to
the manufacturer’s recommended schedules.
4. REPORTING RESULTS
Results are reviewed and verified by the technologist before being
transmitted to the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
Critical results are flagged and communicated to the referring
physician promptly. Documentation of the notification process must
be completed and archived.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Reference ranges for molecular hematologic tests vary based on the
specific assay used and must be consulted from the assay
documentation or literature.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Note any limitations or interferences for each test. Refer to specific
test kit inserts and instructions for detailed information.
1. UPDATES AND CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT
Review and update SOPs regularly to accommodate new techniques,
technologies, and industry standards. Regular training sessions shall
be conducted for all laboratory staff to keep them informed of
changes in protocols and ensure high-quality performance.
