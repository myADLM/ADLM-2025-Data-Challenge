Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Hematologic Neoplasms, TP53 Somatic
Mutation, DNA Sequencing Exons 4-9
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedure for the detection
of TP53 somatic mutations in exons 4-9 using DNA sequencing in
patients with hematologic neoplasms. This procedure aims to ensure
accurate, reliable, and reproducible detection and reporting of
mutations.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel involved in the analytical
phase of TP53 somatic mutation testing using DNA sequencing
technology.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of designated laboratory staff to perform and
document all steps outlined in this SOP. Supervisors are responsible
for ensuring compliance with this SOP, providing necessary training,
and addressing any issues that arise during the procedure.

6. PROCEDURE
6.1 DNA Extraction
1. Extract DNA from the received specimen using the
manufacturer’s instructions provided with the DNA extraction
kit.
2. Quantify and assess the quality of the extracted DNA using a
NanoDrop or equivalent spectrophotometer.
3. Store the extracted DNA at -20°C until further analysis.
6.2 PCR Amplification of TP53 Exons 4-9
1. Prepare the PCR master mix according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
2. Add specific primers for exons 4-9 of the TP53 gene to the
master mix.
3. Dispense the mixture into PCR tubes and add the appropriate
amount of DNA template.
4. Perform PCR using the following cycling conditions:
◦ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 5 minutes
◦ 35 cycles of:
▪ Denaturation: 95°C for 30 seconds
▪ Annealing: 55°C (optimal temperature may vary) for 30
seconds
▪ Extension: 72°C for 1 minute
◦ Final extension: 72°C for 5 minutes
5. Confirm amplification by running an aliquot of the PCR product
on an agarose gel.
6.3 DNA Sequencing
1. Purify the PCR product using a commercial purification kit or
ethanol precipitation method.
2. Set up the sequencing reaction using the BigDye Terminator
v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit or equivalent.
3. Perform cycle sequencing with the following conditions:
◦ Initial denaturation: 96°C for 1 minute
◦ 25 cycles of:
▪ Denaturation: 96°C for 10 seconds
▪ Annealing: 50°C (optimal temperature may vary) for 5
seconds
▪ Extension: 60°C for 4 minutes
4. Purify the sequencing products to remove unincorporated dyes
and salts.
5. Perform capillary electrophoresis using an appropriate DNA
sequencer.
6.4 Data Analysis and Interpretation
1. Import sequencing data into the mutation analysis software.
2. Align the sequenced TP53 exons (4-9) with the reference
sequence.
3. Identify and annotate somatic mutations.
4. Validate detected mutations by reviewing chromatograms for
accuracy.
5. Record findings, noting any potential discrepancies or
anomalies.
6.5 Quality Control
1. Include positive and negative controls in each run to ensure the
accuracy and reliability of the results.
2. Perform a sample comparison with previously known mutation-
positive samples periodically.
3. Document all quality control measures and outcomes.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Review and verify sequencing data and mutation annotations.
2. Prepare a comprehensive report providing:
◦ Patient identification
◦ Summary of the sequencing results
◦ Identified TP53 mutations
◦ Clinical significance of the detected mutations
3. All findings should be validated by a qualified pathologist or
medical geneticist before finalizing the report.
4. Reports should be stored and shared with the appropriate
clinical team following institutional policies.
8. RECORD KEEPING
Maintain records of:
• DNA extraction details
• PCR amplification conditions
• Sequencing run logs
• QC results
• Data analysis and final reports
9. REFERENCES
• Laboratory guidelines and protocols
• Manufacturer's instructions for reagents and equipment
