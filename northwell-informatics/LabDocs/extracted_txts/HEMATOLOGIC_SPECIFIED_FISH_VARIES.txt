HEMATOLOGIC SPECIFIED FISH PROCEDURE
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the handling, processing,
and analysis of specimens for Hematologic Specified Fluorescence
In Situ Hybridization (FISH) testing to ensure accurate and reliable
results.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing and
recording the analysis as defined in this procedure. It is the
responsibility of all staff to identify any deficiencies that may affect
laboratory test results and communicate them to the supervisor.
Supervisors are responsible for ensuring that the procedures are
followed and that corrective actions are taken and documented when
necessary.
1. DEFINITION
Hematologic Specified FISH is a cytogenetic technique used to
identify specific genetic abnormalities associated with various
hematologic diseases, such as leukemia and lymphoma. It involves
the use of fluorescent probes that bind to specific DNA sequences
within the cells, allowing visualization and enumeration of
chromosomal abnormalities.
1. PROCEDURE
Specimen Requirements: - Bone marrow aspirate, peripheral blood,
or paraffin-embedded tissue block. - Specimen must be collected in
an appropriate container (e.g., Sodium Heparin, EDTA tube for liquid
samples, or formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue block). -
Specimens must be labeled with patient identification, collection date,
and type of specimen.
Equipment and Reagents: - Fluorescently labeled DNA probes
specific to the target sequences for the disease marker. -
Fluorescence microscope with appropriate filter sets. - Hybridization
buffer and reagents. - Laboratory glass slides. - Coverslips and
mounting medium. - Centrifuge, water bath, and incubator.
Pre-analytical Phase: - Verify specimen labeling and integrity upon
receipt. - Record specimen receipt in the laboratory information
system (LIS). - Prepare specimen according to the type: - Bone
marrow/peripheral blood: Centrifuge to obtain a cell pellet, resuspend
in PBS and prepare cytospin slides. - Paraffin-embedded tissue:
Section the tissue block and mount tissue sections onto glass slides.
Deparaffinize tissue sections through a series of xylene and ethanol
washes.
Analytical Phase: - Applied to both cytospin slides and tissue
sections, perform the following steps: 1. Denaturation: Incubate
slides at 75-80°C in a denaturation solution of 70% formamide in
2xSSC (Saline Sodium Citrate) for 2 minutes. 2. Dehydration:
Sequentially immerse slides in ethanol series (70%, 85%, 100%) for
2 minutes each. 3. Application of Probes: Apply fluorescent FISH
probes in hybridization buffer to the target area on slides. 4.
Hybridization: Place slides in a humidified chamber and incubate at
37°C for 12-16 hours. 5. Post-hybridization Wash: Wash slides in
0.4xSSC/0.3% Nonidet-P40 at 72°C for 2 minutes, follow with
2xSSC/0.1% Nonidet-P40 at room temperature for 1 minute. 6.
Counterstaining: Apply DAPI (4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole)
counterstain to slides. 7. Mounting: Apply coverslip using antifade
mounting medium to preserve fluorescence.
Microscopic Analysis: - Analyze slides using a fluorescence
microscope equipped with appropriate filter sets. - Perform counts of
hybridization signals in at least 200 interphase nuclei to ensure
statistical reliability. - Record the presence and number of probe
signals (e.g., normal, excess, loss) according to established criteria
for the specific hematologic disease.
Post-analytical Phase: - Interpret results using established criteria
and compare with normal control range. - Document any variations
from the expected results and review potential sources of error. -
Report results in the LIS, including: - Lab identification number -
Patient information - Date of specimen receipt and analysis - Probe
set used - Detailed findings with interpretation - Any limitations or
additional comments related to the analysis
Quality Control: - Include appropriate positive and negative controls
with each batch of specimens analyzed. - Verify probe specificity and
sensitivity against known control samples. - Perform periodic
proficiency testing to ensure technical competency of the laboratory
personnel. - Monitor and record equipment performance and
maintenance (e.g., calibration of the fluorescence microscope).
Reporting Results: - Verify and interpret results according to the
established guidelines. - Ensure accurate data entry into the LIS
system for patient record and test reporting. - Follow the specific
reporting guidelines for the laboratory or institution.
