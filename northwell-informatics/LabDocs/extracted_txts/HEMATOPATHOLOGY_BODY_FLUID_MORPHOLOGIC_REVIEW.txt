Standard Operating Procedure HEMATOPATHOLOGY BODY
FLUID MORPHOLOGIC REVIEW
1. PURPOSE
To ensure accurate and timely review and documentation of
morphologic findings in body fluids for hematopathologic evaluation.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of the trained laboratory technologist to perform
the morphologic review of body fluids according to this protocol and
document the findings appropriately. Supervisors are responsible for
ensuring adherence to the protocol.
2. DEFINITION
Body fluids for hematopathologic review include, but are not limited
to: cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), pleural fluid, peritoneal fluid, pericardial
fluid, synovial fluid, and any other fluid specimens received for
hematologic analysis.
3. PROCEDURE
Specimen Handling
• Upon receipt, ensure the specimen is properly labelled with the
patient's information, collection date, and time.
• Inspect the specimen for volume, clarity, and any clots or
abnormal appearance.
• Centrifuge the specimen at 500-1500 RPM for 5-10 minutes to
concentrate cellular elements.
• Dispose of the supernatant appropriately or store if needed for
biochemical analysis.
Slide Preparation
• Prepare at least two slides from the sediment of the centrifuged
specimen using the cytocentrifuge method or direct smear
method, depending on the specimen type.
• Label each slide with the patient's information and accession
number.
• Stain the slides with Wright-Giemsa or another appropriate
hematologic stain.
Microscopic Examination
• Perform a detailed microscopic review of the stained slides.
• Evaluate cellular morphology, presence of abnormal cells (e.g.,
blasts, atypical lymphocytes), cellular count, differential count, and
any other relevant hematopathologic findings.
• Document findings and interpretations comprehensively. Note
cellular morphology, differential cell count, presence of abnormal
cells, inclusions, crystals, organisms, and other pertinent features.
Quality Control
• Include appropriate control slides (e.g., known positive and
negative cases) to confirm staining quality and cellular
morphology.
• Document any discrepancies or notable observations concerning
slide quality or staining techniques.
Reporting Results
• Detailed morphologic findings must be transcribed into the
laboratory information system (LIS).
• Review and verification of results must be done by a
hematopathologist or designated supervisor.
• Critical findings related to the patient’s diagnosis should be
promptly communicated to the requesting physician or healthcare
provider. Document all communication accordingly.
• Reference interpretative guidelines for body fluid
hematopathologic reviews and adhere strictly to them.
Reference Intervals and Result Interpretation
• CSF:
◦ Normal WBC count: 0-5 WBC/mm³
◦ Normal RBC count: 0 RBC/mm³
◦ No neoplastic cells
• Pleural Fluid:
◦ Normal WBC count: <1000 WBC/mm³
◦ Normals depend on clinical context
◦ Presence of malignant cells is abnormal
• Peritoneal Fluid:
◦ Normal WBC count: <300 WBC/mm³
◦ Normals depend on clinical context
◦ Malignant cells are abnormal
Method Limitations
• Ensure the specimen quality is uncompromised (i.e., not clotted,
properly mixed).
• Specimen integrity issues should be noted and resolved promptly
with the requesting physician or healthcare provider.
• Recognize that atypical cells may require careful interpretation
and correlation with clinical history and ancillary studies.
