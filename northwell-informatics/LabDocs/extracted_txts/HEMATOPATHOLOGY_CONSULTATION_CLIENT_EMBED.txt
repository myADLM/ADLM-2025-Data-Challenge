Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Hematopathology
Consultation: Client Embed
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the steps involved in the
analytical phase of generating results for hematopathology
consultation, specifically focusing on the procedure for client-
embedded specimens. This ensures that the analysis is performed
accurately and efficiently, maintaining the integrity of the specimen
and the quality of the results provided.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the laboratory staff to follow this SOP to
ensure consistent and accurate results. Both the hematopathologist
and the technologists working on the case must ensure that all steps
are completed appropriately and that results are reviewed and
verified before issuance.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
The following are the requirements for hematopathology consultation
with client-embedded specimens:
• Client-embedded specimens typically include formalin-fixed
paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks or unstained slides.
• Appropriate documentation and labeling must accompany the
specimens, including patient identification, specimen type, and
any relevant clinical history.
Unacceptable specimens:
• Specimens without proper labeling or documentation.
• Specimens that have been damaged, improperly fixed, or
inadequately embedded.
1. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
• Microtome
• Water bath
• Oven
• Microscope
• Staining reagents and instruments
• Coverslipping instruments and materials
• Slide storage and transport containers
1. PROCEDURE
A. Receipt and Accessioning
1. Upon receipt, ensure that each specimen is properly labeled
with patient identification and accompanied by the required
documentation.
2. Accession specimens into the laboratory information system
(LIS), assigning a unique case number.
B. Sectioning 3. FFPE blocks are sectioned using a microtome,
typically at 4-micron thickness. 4. Sections are floated on a water
bath at 40°C to remove wrinkles and then mounted onto glass slides.
C. Drying and Deparaffinization 5. Dry slides in a 60°C oven for
15-30 minutes or at room temperature overnight. 6. Deparaffinize
slides by immersing them in xylene for 5 minutes and then
rehydrating them through graded alcohol baths (100%, 95%, and
70%) followed by distilled water.
D. Staining 7. Perform Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) staining as
follows:
• Stains slides in hematoxylin for 5 minutes, rinse in tap water.
• Differentiate in 1% acid alcohol, rinse in tap water.
• Blue in Scott’s tap water substitute, rinse in tap water.
• Stain in eosin for 3 minutes, rinse in tap water.
1. Additional stains or immunohistochemistry (IHC) may be
performed as required based on the diagnostic requirements.
2. Use appropriate controls to ensure staining quality and
accuracy.
E. Coverslipping 10. Dehydrate slides through graded alcohol baths
(70%, 95%, 100%) and clear in xylene. 11. Apply coverslips using
mounting media.
F. Microscopic Examination 12. Review slides under the
microscope, documenting findings and any relevant observations. 13.
If additional stains or IHC are necessary, prepare new sections and
repeat the staining and review process.
G. Quality Control 14. Include positive and negative controls with
each staining batch to ensure the validity of results. 15. Review all
control slides to confirm proper staining before releasing patient
results.
H. Reporting and Verification 16. Draft a detailed pathology report
summarizing the findings. 17. Review and verify the report with the
pathologist, ensuring all required information and interpretations are
included. 18. Enter the final verified report into the LIS and release it
to the appropriate physician or client.
I. Documentation and Record-Keeping 19. Maintain all
documentation, including slide labels, staining logs, and control
records, as per laboratory protocols. 20. Archive slides and blocks as
per the laboratory’s retention policy for future reference or additional
testing.
