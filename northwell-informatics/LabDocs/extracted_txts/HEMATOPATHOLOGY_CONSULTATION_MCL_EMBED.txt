Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Title:
HEMATOPATHOLOGY CONSULTATION, MCL EMBED
1. PURPOSE: The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedure for
the analytical phase of generating results for Hematopathology
Consultation, focusing on Morphologic Consultation Lab (MCL)
Embedded tissues. This protocol ensures that all procedures are
standardized, results are accurate, and documentation is complete
and traceable.
2. RESPONSIBILITY:
• Laboratory Technologists are responsible for performing the MCL
Embed procedures accurately.
• Supervisors are responsible for overseeing the procedure,
ensuring compliance, and addressing any issues that arise.
• All staff members must comply with quality control checks and
documentation requirements.
3. DEFINITIONS:
• MCL Embed: Morphologic Consultation Lab-embedded tissues
refer to specialized tissue samples embedded in a medium for
detailed histopathological examination.
• Hematopathology: A branch of pathology which studies diseases
that affect blood cells, bone marrow, and lymph nodes.
4. SPECIMEN: Preferred/Acceptable:
• Fresh tissue samples correctly embedded in paraffin blocks.
• Tissue samples adequately fixed using appropriate fixatives as
specified by the laboratory protocol.
Unacceptable:
• Tissue samples with inappropriate fixation.
• Samples with unidentified or unclear labeling.
• Damaged or improperly stored tissue blocks.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES:
• Microtome
• Slide warmer
• Histology-grade slides and coverslips
• Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) staining reagents
• Mounting medium
• Immersion oil
• Embedding medium
• Fixatives
• Forceps and brushes
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
6. PROCEDURE:
A. Tissue Sectioning:
1. Carefully trim the paraffin-embedded tissue blocks to expose
the tissue surface.
2. Using a microtome, cut 3-5 micron thick sections from the
tissue block.
3. Float the cut sections on a water bath adjusted to 40-45°C to
flatten them.
4. Transfer the sections from the water bath onto prepared
histology slides.
B. Slide Preparation:
1. Place the slides with tissue sections on a slide warmer set at
37-40°C for 30 minutes to ensure adherence.
2. Label the slides with appropriate patient information and
accession numbers.
C. H&E Staining:
1. Deparaffinize the slides by immersing them in xylene for 2-3
minutes. Repeat in a second xylene bath.
2. Rehydrate the slides by sequentially immersing them in 100%,
95%, and 70% ethanol baths for 2 minutes each.
3. Rinse the slides in distilled water for 2 minutes.
4. Stain the slides in Hematoxylin for 5 minutes.
5. Rinse the slides in running tap water for 2 minutes.
6. Differentiate in acid alcohol solution for a few seconds until the
sections are light blue.
7. Rinse in distilled water and then stain in Eosin for 1-2 minutes.
8. Dehydrate the slides through 95%, 100% ethanol, and xylene
for 2 minutes each.
D. Mounting:
1. After clearing, place a few drops of mounting medium on the
tissue sections.
2. Gently place coverslips over the sections, avoiding air bubbles.
3. Allow the slides to dry completely before microscopic
examination.
7. ANALYSIS:
1. Examine the stained slides under the microscope.
2. Evaluate and document the morphology of the blood cells, bone
marrow, or lymph node tissue.
3. Identify any pathological changes, abnormalities, or diagnostic
features relevant to the hematopathology consultation.
8. QUALITY CONTROL:
1. Perform daily calibration checks on the microtome and staining
equipment.
2. Include positive and negative control slides with each batch of
samples to ensure staining quality.
3. Document all quality control activities, reagent lot numbers, and
any deviations observed.
9. REPORTING RESULTS:
1. Record findings and observations in the laboratory information
system (LIS).
2. Ensure that all patient information and slide identifiers are
accurately documented.
3. Review and verify the final report before submission to the
requesting pathologist or physician.
10. TROUBLESHOOTING:
1. If tissue sections are too thick or thin, adjust the microtome
settings accordingly.
2. If staining artifacts are observed, review the staining protocol
and reagent conditions.
3. In case of equipment malfunction, notify the supervisor and
initiate corrective actions as per the laboratory's maintenance
protocol.
11. REFERENCE INTERVALS:
Use standard hematopathology reference intervals and diagnostic
criteria provided in appropriate hematopathology textbooks and
resources.

13. REVIEW:
This SOP must be reviewed annually or upon the introduction of new
techniques or equipment.

This SOP has been reviewed and approved by the Laboratory
Director.
