Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Hemiplegic Migraine with or without
Epilepsy Gene Panel, Varies
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the analysis of the
Hemiplegic Migraine with or without Epilepsy Gene Panel, ensuring
the accuracy, reliability, and integrity of the results.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of designated laboratory personnel to follow this
SOP to perform the gene panel analysis accurately. Any
discrepancies or concerns during the process must be reported to a
supervisor.
2. DEFINITION
This procedure describes the steps to be followed during the
analytical phase of genetic testing for Hemiplegic Migraine with or
without Epilepsy using a gene panel. This includes DNA extraction,
PCR amplification, sequencing, data analysis, and reporting of
results.
3. PROCEDURE
A) Sample Preparation
1. DNA Extraction:
◦ Ensure that the sample received is properly labeled and
verified.
◦ Use the laboratory's standard DNA extraction protocol for
extracting high-quality genomic DNA from the specimen
(blood, saliva, or buccal swab).
◦ Record the sample ID, extraction date, and technician
initials in the lab logbook.
◦ Measure the concentration and purity of the extracted DNA
using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer.
◦ Store the DNA at -20°C until further processing.
2. PCR Amplification:
◦ Design primers specific to the genes of interest in the
Hemiplegic Migraine with or without Epilepsy gene panel.
◦ Prepare the PCR master mix according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Add the genomic DNA to the PCR master mix.
◦ Perform PCR amplification using a thermal cycler with
optimized cycling conditions.
◦ Verify the amplification success by running 5 µL of the PCR
product on an agarose gel.
B) Sequencing and Data Generation
1. Library Preparation:
◦ Use an appropriate library preparation kit for next-
generation sequencing (NGS) compatible with the
sequencer.
◦ Follow the kit protocols for end-repair, adapter ligation, and
amplification of the PCR products.
◦ Quantify the library using Qubit or another appropriate
method.
◦ Perform quality checks of the library on an Agilent
Bioanalyzer.
2. Sequencing:
◦ Load the prepared library onto the sequencing instrument
(e.g., Illumina MiSeq or NextSeq).
◦ Set up the sequencing run according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
◦ Monitor the sequencing run for quality metrics.
C) Data Analysis
1. Raw Data Processing:
◦ Obtain FASTQ files after the completion of the sequencing
run.
◦ Use bioinformatics tools for quality control and trimming of
low-quality reads and adapter sequences.
2. Sequence Alignment:
◦ Align the high-quality reads to the reference genome (hg19
or hg38) using appropriate alignment software (e.g., BWA-
MEM).
3. Variant Calling:
◦ Use variant calling tools (e.g., GATK, FreeBayes) to identify
single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and small insertions/
deletions (indels).
◦ Generate variant call format (VCF) files.
4. Variant Annotation:
◦ Annotate the variants using bioinformatics tools (e.g., VEP,
Annovar) to predict the functional impact.
D) Result Interpretation and Reporting
1. Variant Evaluation:
◦ Filter the variants based on quality metrics, allele frequency,
and pathogenicity predictions.
◦ Cross-reference variants with clinical databases (e.g.,
ClinVar, HGMD).
◦ Interpret the clinical significance of the identified variants.
2. Technical Review:
◦ Perform a secondary review of the data and interpretation
by another qualified laboratory scientist.
3. Report Generation:
◦ Generate a comprehensive report summarizing the
identified variants, their clinical significance, and the
interpretation.
◦ Review and sign the report by the laboratory director or an
authorized personnel.
4. Result Communication:
◦ Deliver the final signed report to the ordering physician.
◦ Ensure proper documentation and archiving of all the
records in compliance with regulatory requirements.
Reference Intervals and Quality Control:
• Include internal positive and negative controls in each run.
• Ensure that all quality control samples meet the predefined
criteria.
• Follow the lab’s specific guidelines for handling and reporting any
out-of-range or unexpected QC results.
