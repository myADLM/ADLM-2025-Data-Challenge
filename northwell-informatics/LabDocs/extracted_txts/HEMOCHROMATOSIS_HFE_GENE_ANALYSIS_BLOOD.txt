Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase Protocol for Hemochromatosis HFE Gene
Analysis, Blood
Effective Date: [Insert Date] Review Date: [Insert Date] Version:
1.0
1. PURPOSE
To provide clear guidelines and procedures for the analytical phase of
Hemochromatosis HFE Gene Analysis, including the extraction,
amplification, and sequencing of the HFE gene from blood
specimens. This SOP ensures accurate and reliable results for
diagnosing hereditary hemochromatosis.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all laboratory personnel to adhere to this
SOP during the analytical phase of Hemochromatosis HFE Gene
Analysis. Designated personnel should oversee the process to
ensure compliance, troubleshooting, and documentation.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred Specimen:
◦ Whole blood collected in EDTA or ACD tubes.
◦ Minimum volume: 5 ml.
• Unacceptable Specimen:
◦ Hemolyzed samples.
◦ Clotted samples.
◦ Specimens not labeled properly.
Ensure specimens are labeled with patient identifiers and collection
date/time.
4. PROCEDURE
A. DNA Extraction
1. Ensure specimens are stored at 2-8°C until DNA extraction.
2. Perform DNA extraction using a validated genomic DNA
extraction kit as per manufacturer’s instructions:
◦ Label extraction tubes with specimen identifiers.
◦ Add the appropriate volume of blood to the extraction tube.
◦ Follow kit instructions for cell lysis, protein precipitation, and
DNA elution.
3. Quantify and assess the purity of extracted DNA using
spectrophotometry (e.g., NanoDrop):
◦ Record the concentration and A260/A280 ratio.
◦ Acceptable purity: A260/A280 ratio of 1.8 - 2.0.
B. PCR Amplification
1. Set up PCR reactions targeting the HFE gene (typically Exons
2 and 4):
◦ Prepare master mix with:
▪ DNA polymerase
▪ dNTPs
▪ Primers specific to HFE gene
▪ Buffer
◦ Aliquot master mix into PCR tubes, labeled appropriately,
and add DNA template from each specimen.
2. Program the thermocycler for the following conditions
(example):
◦ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 5 minutes
◦ 35 cycles of:
▪ Denaturation: 95°C for 30 seconds
▪ Annealing: 56°C for 30 seconds
▪ Extension: 72°C for 1 minute
◦ Final extension: 72°C for 5 minutes
3. Verify PCR amplification by agarose gel electrophoresis:
◦ Prepare 2% agarose gel with ethidium bromide.
◦ Load PCR products and run gel at 100V for 45 minutes.
◦ Visualize bands under UV light and document results.
C. Sequencing
1. Prepare PCR products for sequencing:
◦ Clean up PCR products using a commercial purification kit.
◦ Quantify purified PCR product.
2. Perform sequencing reactions as per sequencing protocol:
◦ Prepare master mix for sequencing reactions.
◦ Aliquot sequencing master mix into tubes and add purified
PCR product.
◦ Follow manufacturer’s instructions for sequencing on an
automated sequencer (e.g., ABI 3500).
3. Analyze sequencing data using appropriate software:
◦ Ensure high-quality sequencing traces.
◦ Align sequences to reference HFE gene.
◦ Identify any variants/mutations (e.g., C282Y, H63D).
5. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include negative and positive controls in PCR and sequencing
runs.
• Assess controls to confirm reliability of results.
• Document all control results and troubleshooting steps if controls
fail.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
• Review and verify the sequencing data.
• Compare identified HFE gene variants to clinical significance
databases.
• Generate a comprehensive report including:
◦ HFE gene variants identified.
◦ Interpretation of results in the context of hemochromatosis.
◦ Comments on any anomalies or issues encountered during
analysis.
• Follow site-specific reporting guidelines to ensure timely and
accurate communication of results to clinicians.
