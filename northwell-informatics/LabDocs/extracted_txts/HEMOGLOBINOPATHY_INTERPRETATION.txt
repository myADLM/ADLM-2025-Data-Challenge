Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Hemoglobinopathy
Interpretation
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to provide standardized procedures for
the analytical phase of generating results for Hemoglobinopathy
Interpretation, ensuring accurate and reliable results.
Hemoglobinopathies are genetic disorders affecting the structure or
production of hemoglobin and require specialized testing and
interpretation for proper diagnosis and management.
1. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all designated laboratory personnel involved in
the analysis and interpretation of hemoglobinopathy testing.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
Laboratory personnel performing hemoglobinopathy interpretation
are responsible for following this SOP and ensuring quality control
measures are adhered to. It is the responsibility of the laboratory
supervisor to ensure compliance with this SOP and to address any
issues or discrepancies that arise.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred Specimen: Whole blood collected in EDTA (lavender-
top) tube.
• Minimum Volume: 2 mL
• Specimen Stability: Stable at 2-8°C for up to 7 days. Do not
freeze.
• Unacceptable Specimens: Clotted specimens, grossly hemolyzed
samples, or specimens collected in anticoagulants other than
EDTA.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Hemoglobin Electrophoresis Equipment
• High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) Analyzer
• Capillary Electrophoresis System
• Isoelectric Focusing (IEF) Equipment
• Hemoglobin S and Hemoglobin C Solubility Tests
• DNA Analysis Reagents (if applicable)
• Quality Control Materials
• Calibration Standards
1. PROCEDURE
A. Hemoglobin Electrophoresis
1. Prepare the electrophoresis gel according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
2. Load the patient's sample and controls onto the gel.
3. Run the electrophoresis at the specified voltage and duration.
4. Stain and visualize the bands using appropriate staining
reagents.
5. Compare the patient's band pattern with known control patterns
to identify any abnormal hemoglobin variants.
B. High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC)
1. Calibrate the HPLC analyzer with standard hemoglobin
solutions.
2. Inject the patient's sample into the HPLC system.
3. Allow the chromatographic separation of hemoglobin fractions
to occur.
4. Analyze the chromatogram to identify and quantify the different
hemoglobin fractions.
5. Compare the patient's results with known reference ranges and
patterns.
C. Capillary Electrophoresis
1. Prepare the capillary electrophoresis system according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
2. Load the patient's sample into the capillary.
3. Run the capillary electrophoresis and monitor the separation of
hemoglobin fractions.
4. Analyze the electropherogram to identify hemoglobin variants
and their relative concentrations.
5. Compare the patient's results with reference patterns.
D. Isoelectric Focusing (IEF)
1. Prepare the IEF gel and focusing solutions as per the
manufacturer's instructions.
2. Load the patient's sample onto the IEF gel.
3. Run the isoelectric focusing to separate hemoglobin variants
based on their isoelectric points.
4. Stain and visualize the separated bands.
5. Compare the patient's band pattern with known controls to
identify any abnormal hemoglobin variants.
E. Hemoglobin Solubility Test (for Hemoglobin S and C)
1. Mix the patient's sample with the solubility reagent.
2. Observe the formation or absence of turbidity, indicating the
presence or absence of Hemoglobin S or C.
3. Record the results and compare with controls.
F. DNA Analysis (if applicable)
1. Extract DNA from the patient's blood sample.
2. Perform polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and other molecular
techniques to identify specific mutations associated with
hemoglobinopathies.
3. Analyze the results and compare with known mutation
databases.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
5. Run positive and negative controls with each batch of patient
samples.
6. Calibrate equipment as per the manufacturer's guidelines
before use.
7. Document all quality control measures taken, including lot
numbers and expiration dates of reagents used.
8. Investigate and resolve any discrepancies in control results
before releasing patient results.
9. INTERPRETATION AND REPORTING
10. Review all test results and quality control data to ensure
accuracy.
11. Provide an interpretation of the hemoglobinopathy identified
based on the test results and reference data.
12. Document the interpretation and any comments or
recommendations for further testing if necessary.
13. Verify and report the results to the ordering physician or
clinician.
14. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Refer to the reference intervals provided in the specific test
manufacturer’s insert or established by the laboratory for the
population being tested.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to manufacturers’ inserts for limitations specific to each
method used in the analysis.
1. REFERENCES
• Refer to the manufacturer’s instructions and inserts for all
equipment and reagents used.
• Current literature and guidelines on hemoglobinopathy testing and
interpretation.
1. DOCUMENTATION
• Maintain records of all calibrations, quality control data, patient
test results, and interpretations in the laboratory information
system (LIS).
• Ensure all documentation is complete, accurate, and up to date.
By following this SOP, the laboratory will ensure the accurate and
reliable analysis and interpretation of hemoglobinopathy testing,
contributing to improved diagnosis and management of patients with
hemoglobin disorders.
