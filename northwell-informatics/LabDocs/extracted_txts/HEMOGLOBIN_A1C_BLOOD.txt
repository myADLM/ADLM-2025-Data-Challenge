Standard Operating Procedure for Hemoglobin A1c Analysis
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the analysis of Hemoglobin
A1c (HbA1c) in blood specimens, ensuring accurate and reproducible
results.
Responsibility:
All designated laboratory staff involved in HbA1c testing are
responsible for following this SOP. Supervisors are responsible for
ensuring adherence to this procedure and addressing any issues that
may arise.
1. DEFINITION
Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) is a form of hemoglobin that is used
primarily to identify the average plasma glucose concentration over
prolonged periods of time. HbA1c testing is important for managing
patients with diabetes.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Acceptable Specimens:
• Whole blood collected in EDTA (lavender-top) tubes.
• Specimens should be properly labeled with patient identification,
collection date, and time.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed samples.
• Clotted samples.
• Samples not stored or transported at proper temperatures.
• Specimens without proper labeling.
Stability and Storage:
• Whole blood specimens are stable at 2-8°C for up to 7 days. For
longer storage, freeze specimens at -20°C.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
Equipment:
• HbA1c analyzer (e.g., HPLC-based analyzer, immunoassay-
based analyzer)
• Micropipettes and tips
• Vortex mixer
• Centrifuge
Reagents:
• Calibrators and controls specific to the HbA1c analyzer
• Lysis reagent (if required by equipment)
• System-specific reagents and buffers
• Quality control materials at two levels (normal and abnormal)
1. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
• Ensure all equipment is operational and properly calibrated.
• Verify that all reagents are within their expiration dates and
prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions.
• Prepare quality control materials according to QC protocols.
Sample Processing:
1. Sample Identification:
◦ Confirm patient information on the sample tube against the
laboratory requisition form.
2. Sample Handling:
◦ Mix the whole blood sample thoroughly by gently inverting
the tube several times or using a vortex mixer.
3. Centrifugation (if required):
◦ Centrifuge the sample according to analyzer requirements
to obtain erythrocytes if specified by the analyzer.
4. Analysis:
◦ Load the analyzer with the samples, calibrators, and quality
control materials as directed by the manufacturer.
◦ Enter patient and sample identification details into the
analyzer.
◦ Follow the analyzer's prompt to perform the analysis,
ensuring proper placement of samples, reagents, and
quality controls.
◦ Start the analysis process as per the analyzer's instructions.
5. Recording Results:
◦ The analyzer will automatically generate HbA1c values,
including quality control results.
◦ Review results for any flags or error codes and take
corrective actions as necessary.
◦ Document all results, calibrations, and QC data in the
appropriate logs.
Quality Control:
• Perform quality control tests at the beginning of the shift, after
calibration, and as needed based on the accuracy of results.
• Ensure that both normal and abnormal controls are within the
acceptable range before testing patient samples.
• Document all QC results. Investigate and resolve any out-of-
range QC results before proceeding with patient samples.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Review, verify, and validate patient results.
• Enter the HbA1c results into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
• Ensure results are communicated promptly to the appropriate
healthcare providers.
Reference Intervals:
• Normal: 4.0% - 5.6%
• At risk (pre-diabetes): 5.7% - 6.4%
• Diabetes: 6.5% and above
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemoglobin variants can interfere with some methods. Verify if
the method used is influenced by common hemoglobin variants.
• Hemolyzed or improperly stored samples can give inaccurate
results.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING AND CORRECTIVE ACTION
• If the analyzer indicates an error or if the QC fails, repeat the test
starting from the sample preparation step.
• If the problem persists, consult the analyzer manual or contact
technical support.
• Document all troubleshooting steps and corrective actions.
1. DOCUMENTATION
• Maintain a record of all calibrations, QC results, sample
processing details, and analytical results as per laboratory
protocols.
• Ensure all logs and electronic records are kept up to date and are
readily accessible.
