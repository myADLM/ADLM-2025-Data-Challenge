Standard Operating Procedure
Hemoglobin Analysis, Blood
1. PURPOSE
To provide guidelines for the analytical phase of hemoglobin analysis
in whole blood. This procedure ensures the accurate and precise
measurement of hemoglobin levels using an automated hematology
analyzer.
Responsibility: All laboratory personnel performing hemoglobin
analysis are responsible for following this SOP and ensuring the
accuracy and reliability of results.
1. DEFINITION
Hemoglobin is the iron-containing oxygen-transport metalloprotein in
the red blood cells. Hemoglobin analysis involves the quantification of
hemoglobin concentration in whole blood.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Automated Hematology Analyzer (e.g., Sysmex, Coulter, or
equivalent)
Reagents:
• Hemoglobin Diluent
• Lyse Reagent
• Quality Control (QC) Materials (Normal, Low, and High)
Supplies:
• Whole blood specimen (EDTA anticoagulated)
• Sample cups
• Controls and calibrators
1. PROCEDURE
4.1 Calibration
• Perform calibration of the hematology analyzer as per
manufacturer's instructions using the calibrators provided by the
manufacturer at the recommended intervals.
4.2 Quality Control
• Run QC materials at the beginning of each shift, after instrument
maintenance, and after reagent changes.
• Ensure QC results fall within acceptable ranges. Document all QC
results in the QC log.
• If QC results are out of range, troubleshoot according to
manufacturer's instructions, re-run QC, and document actions
taken.
4.3 Specimen Preparation
• Ensure whole blood specimens are adequately mixed by gentle
inversion (8-10 times).
• Check specimens for clots, hemolysis, or improper labeling.
Reject unacceptable specimens.
• Allow refrigerated specimens to return to room temperature
before analysis.
4.4 Analyzing Specimens
• Load specimens onto the hematology analyzer according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
• Select the appropriate program for hemoglobin analysis.
• Ensure the analyzer's parameters (e.g., dilution, mixing) are set
correctly.
4.5 Generating Results
• Run the specimens through the analyzer.
• Verify that the analyzer's system check (e.g., background count)
is within acceptable limits.
• Review results for any flags or error codes. If any issues arise,
follow the troubleshooting steps.
4.6 Verification and Validation of Results
• Compare results to previous patient results (if available) for
consistency.
• Investigate any unusual or unexpected results, repeating the
analysis if necessary.
• Validate results by ensuring they meet clinical and laboratory
criteria before reporting.
4.7 Documentation and Reporting
• Document all results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Report critical values immediately to the responsible healthcare
provider as per laboratory policy.
• Ensure all steps, including calibration, QC, specimen handling,
and result verification, are documented appropriately.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING
If the analyzer fails to produce accurate results:
• Check for and correct any instrument errors (e.g., clogs, leaks).
• Replace reagents and recalibrate the instrument if necessary.
• Consult the instrument manual for additional troubleshooting
steps.
• Contact technical support if unresolved.
1. MAINTENANCE
• Perform daily, weekly, and monthly maintenance per the
manufacturer’s instructions.
• Document all maintenance activities, including reagent lot
numbers and expiration dates.
1. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS
• Use personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves and lab
coats.
• Handle all specimens as potentially infectious. Follow biosafety
guidelines.
• Dispose of waste according to institutional and regulatory
requirements.
