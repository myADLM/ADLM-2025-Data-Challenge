STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP)
Title: Hemoglobin and Hematocrit (H & H) Analysis
1. Purpose To ensure accurate and reliable measurement of
hemoglobin and hematocrit levels in patient blood samples for
clinical diagnosis and monitoring.
2. Scope This protocol applies to the analysis of hemoglobin and
hematocrit levels using automated hematology analyzers.
3. Responsibility It is the responsibility of the designated
laboratory staff to perform and document the H & H analysis as
per this SOP. All laboratory personnel must ensure adherence
to this protocol to maintain the quality and validity of test
results.
4. Definitions
• Hemoglobin (Hb): A protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen.
• Hematocrit (Hct): The proportion of blood volume occupied by red
blood cells.
1. Specimen Requirements
• Specimen: EDTA anticoagulated whole blood.
• Preferred volume: 3 mL.
• Acceptable: Minimum of 1 mL.
• Unacceptable specimens:
◦ Clotted samples.
◦ Samples with improper labeling.
◦ Samples showing gross hemolysis.
◦ Samples received in inappropriate containers.
1. Equipment and Supplies
• Automated hematology analyzer (e.g., Sysmex, Beckman
Coulter).
• EDTA anticoagulated blood samples.
• Quality control (QC) materials.
• Calibrators.
1. Procedure A) Sample Preparation
2. Ensure the sample is well-mixed by gently inverting the EDTA
tube 8-10 times.
3. Label the sample with the unique patient identifier and
accession number.
B) Calibration and Quality Control
1. Perform instrument calibration using the appropriate calibrators
as per manufacturer’s guidelines.
2. Run daily quality controls (both normal and abnormal levels)
and document results. QC results must fall within acceptable
ranges before proceeding with patient samples. If QC fails,
troubleshoot per manufacturer’s instructions and do not report
patient results until QC is within range.
C) Hemoglobin and Hematocrit Analysis
1. Load the properly labeled samples onto the automated
hematology analyzer.
2. Initiate the analysis following the analyzer's standard operating
procedures.
D) Result Verification and Documentation
1. Review the results generated by the analyzer for any flags or
error messages.
2. Compare the results with the control values to confirm
accuracy.
3. Document hemoglobin and hematocrit results in the laboratory
information system (LIS).
E) Reference Intervals and Critical Values
• Hemoglobin:
◦ Males: 13.8-17.2 g/dL
◦ Females: 12.1-15.1 g/dL
• Hematocrit:
◦ Males: 41-50%
◦ Females: 36-44%
• Critical Values:
◦ Hemoglobin <7.0 g/dL or >20.0 g/dL
◦ Hematocrit <21% or >65%
F) Reporting Results
1. Results must be reviewed and validated by a qualified
technologist before reporting.
2. Report critical values immediately to the responsible clinician as
per the laboratory’s critical value policy.
G) Quality Control and Maintenance
1. Perform and document routine maintenance and calibration
procedures as per manufacturer’s guidelines.
2. Maintain records of instrument maintenance, calibrations, and
quality control procedures.
3. Quality Assurance Regular audits and proficiency testing should
be conducted to ensure compliance with this protocol and to
maintain the accuracy and reliability of test results.
4. Limitations Refer to the hematology analyzer’s user manual for
specific limitations affecting the hemoglobin and hematocrit
measurements.
5. References
• Manufacturer’s User Manual for the hematology analyzer (e.g.,
Sysmex, Beckman Coulter).
• Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines.
1. Review and Approval This SOP will be reviewed annually and
updated as necessary. Approved by the Laboratory Director and
the Quality Assurance Manager.
