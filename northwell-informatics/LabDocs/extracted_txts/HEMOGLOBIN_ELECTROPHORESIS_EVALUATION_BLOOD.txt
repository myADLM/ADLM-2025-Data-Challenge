STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE: HEMOGLOBIN
ELECTROPHORESIS EVALUATION, BLOOD
1. PURPOSE
To provide detailed instructions for performing hemoglobin
electrophoresis evaluations on blood samples to identify and quantify
different types of hemoglobin present in the blood. This ensures
accurate and consistent results for patient diagnosis and
management of hemoglobinopathies.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of trained laboratory personnel to follow this
procedure to accurately perform hemoglobin electrophoresis and
document results. Supervisors must ensure all staff are adequately
trained and competent in this procedure.
3. DEFINITION
Hemoglobin electrophoresis: a laboratory technique used to separate
and identify normal and abnormal hemoglobin variants in a blood
sample.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/acceptable:
• 5 mL of whole blood collected in an EDTA tube (lavender top).
• Specimen should be stored at 2-8°C if not analyzed immediately
and analyzed within 7 days of collection.
Unacceptable:
• Clotted blood samples.
• Samples collected in tubes other than EDTA (e.g., heparin or
citrate).
• Specimens that show signs of hemolysis.
5. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• Hemoglobin Electrophoresis Kit
• EDTA blood sample
• Diluent solution
• Gel electrophoresis apparatus and power supply
• Buffer solution (pH 8.6)
• Staining solution
• Destaining solution
• Hemoglobin standards (HbA, HbF, HbS, HbC, etc.)
• Applicator
• Tracking dye
• Blotting paper
• Protective equipment (gloves, lab coat, eye protection)
6. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation:
1. Ensure blood samples are properly labeled with patient
identifiers.
2. Allow the whole blood sample to come to room temperature.
3. Mix the sample gently by inverting the tube several times.
B. Preparation of Gel Electrophoresis:
1. Prepare the gel according to the hemoglobin electrophoresis kit
instructions.
2. Insert the gel into the electrophoresis chamber and pour the
buffer solution into the chamber compartments.
C. Loading Samples:
1. Apply a small volume of each hemoglobin standard and the
blood sample onto the designated wells of the gel using an
applicator. Use tracking dye to monitor the progress of
electrophoresis.
2. Ensure the sample wells are not overloaded to prevent
smearing.
D. Running the Electrophoresis:
1. Connect the electrophoresis chamber to the power supply.
2. Set the voltage and run time according to the hemoglobin
electrophoresis kit instructions (typically 200 volts for 30-60
minutes).
3. Monitor the progress of the dye front and ensure even migration
of samples.
E. Staining and Destaining the Gel:
1. At the end of electrophoresis, carefully remove the gel from the
chamber.
2. Place the gel in the staining solution and incubate as specified
(e.g., 30 minutes).
3. Rinse the gel in distilled water and then destain it using the
destaining solution until clear bands are visible.
F. Interpretation of Results:
1. Compare the migrated hemoglobin bands in the patient sample
to those of the known hemoglobin standards.
2. Identify the types and quantities of hemoglobin present by their
position and intensity on the gel.
3. Document the types and approximate percentages of each
hemoglobin fraction detected.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Run quality control samples with known hemoglobin variants
alongside patient samples to ensure assay accuracy.
2. Document and review QC results to verify the performance of
the electrophoresis procedure.
3. If QC results are outside of acceptable limits, assess and
troubleshoot the assay before proceeding with patient sample
analysis.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Analyze the gel bands and record the findings in the laboratory
information system.
2. Results should be reviewed and verified by a qualified
laboratory technologist.
3. Critical or unexpected findings must be documented and
communicated promptly to the requesting physician.
9. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• HbA: 95-98%
• HbF: 0.5-1%
• HbA2: 2-3.5%
• HbS, HbC, HbE, etc.: not typically present in non-pathological
samples.
10. METHOD LIMITATIONS
This method may not distinguish all abnormal hemoglobins or
quantify them accurately in the presence of interfering substances.
For detailed analysis, confirmatory testing may be required.
