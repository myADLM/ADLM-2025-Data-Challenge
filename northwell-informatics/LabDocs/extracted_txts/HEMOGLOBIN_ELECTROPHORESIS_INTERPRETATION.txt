Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Hemoglobin
Electrophoresis Interpretation
1. PURPOSE
This standard operating procedure (SOP) is designed to provide a
structured approach for the interpretation of hemoglobin
electrophoresis results to ensure consistent, accurate, and reliable
diagnosis of hemoglobinopathies and thalassemias.
Responsibility:
1.1 It is the responsibility of the designated Medical Laboratory
Scientist (MLS) to perform hemoglobin electrophoresis, interpret the
results, and document the findings accurately.
1.2 It is the responsibility of the laboratory supervisor to review the
results and the interpretations, ensuring that they are correct and in
accordance with established guidelines.
1. DEFINITIONS
2.1 Hemoglobin Electrophoresis: A laboratory technique used to
separate and identify different hemoglobins based on their movement
in an electric field. 2.2 Hemoglobinopathies: Inherited disorders
affecting the structure or production of hemoglobin. 2.3
Thalassemias: Inherited disorders characterized by abnormal
production of hemoglobin, leading to anemia.
1. PROCEDURE
3.1 Sample Preparation:
3.1.1 Ensure that the specimen received is whole blood collected in
an EDTA tube. Verify that the specimen is properly labeled with the
patient's identification details. 3.1.2 Mix the blood sample by gently
inverting the EDTA tube several times to ensure uniformity. 3.1.3
Prepare a hemolysate by adding a small volume of whole blood to a
hemolyzing reagent, according to manufacturer's instructions.
3.2 Electrophoresis Setup:
3.2.1 Load the prepared hemolysate onto the electrophoresis gel.
3.2.2 Assemble the electrophoresis apparatus according to the
manufacturer's guidelines. 3.2.3 Apply electric current under the
conditions specified for hemoglobin electrophoresis, typically around
200 volts for 20-30 minutes. 3.2.4 Allow the bands to develop and
separate adequately.
3.3 Staining and Visualization:
3.3.1 Once the electrophoresis is complete, remove the gel from the
apparatus. 3.3.2 Stain the gel using the appropriate hemoglobin
staining solution as per manufacturer's instructions. 3.3.3 Rinse the
gel to remove excess stain and allow it to dry.
3.4 Interpretation of Results:
3.4.1 Compare the resolved hemoglobin bands against known
controls and standards run concurrently. 3.4.2 Identify and quantify
the hemoglobin types present (e.g., HbA, HbF, HbS, HbC) by
matching their positions relative to the control bands. 3.4.3 Calculate
the percentage of each hemoglobin fraction using densitometric
scanning or other quantification methods as applicable.
3.5 Documentation and Reporting:
3.5.1 Record the results, including the type and percentage of each
hemoglobin fraction, in the laboratory information system (LIS). 3.5.2
Confirm that the interpretations align with the clinical context and the
patient's medical history when available. 3.5.3 Report findings to the
referring physician with appropriate comments on potential clinical
implications.
3.6 Quality Control:
3.6.1 Run internal quality control samples with known hemoglobin
patterns during each electrophoresis batch to ensure accuracy. 3.6.2
Document the QC results and take corrective actions if controls fall
outside acceptable limits.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
4.1 Review the interpreted results thoroughly for any discrepancies or
errors. 4.2 Ensure that the final report is accurate and includes a
detailed interpretation of the hemoglobin pattern observed. 4.3
Communicate any critical findings immediately to the referring
physician or healthcare provider.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
5.1 Normal adult ranges:
• Hemoglobin A (HbA): 96-98%
• Hemoglobin A2 (HbA2): 1.5-3.5%
• Hemoglobin F (HbF): 0-2%
5.2 Reference intervals for other hemoglobin variants should be
based on the specific patient population and established laboratory
guidelines.
1. LIMITATIONS
6.1 Hemoglobin electrophoresis may not detect all hemoglobin
variants or distinguish between some forms. 6.2 Interpretation should
always consider the clinical context and be informed by additional
confirmatory tests if necessary.

guidelines and literature on hemoglobinopathies and thalassemias.
