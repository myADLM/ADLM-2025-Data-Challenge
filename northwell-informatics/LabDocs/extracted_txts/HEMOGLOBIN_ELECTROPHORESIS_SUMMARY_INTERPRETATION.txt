Standard Operating Procedure:
Hemoglobin Electrophoresis Summary
Interpretation
1. PURPOSE
This procedure outlines the steps required to analyze hemoglobin
electrophoresis results and generate an accurate summary
interpretation.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for
following the protocol as described and ensuring the accurate
interpretation and documentation of hemoglobin electrophoresis
results. The following procedure assumes that the specimen has
already been collected, received, and accessioned.
2. DEFINITION
Hemoglobin electrophoresis is a laboratory technique used to
separate different types of hemoglobin proteins present in a blood
sample. This helps in diagnosing hemoglobinopathies such as sickle
cell disease, thalassemias, and other hemoglobin variants.
3. PROCEDURE
A. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies
• Hemoglobin electrophoresis apparatus
• Reagent system
• Control samples
• Electrophoresis gel
• Staining solution
• Destaining solution
• Laboratory reagents (e.g., buffer solutions)
• Analytical instrumentation
• Hematology analyzer
• Hemoglobin electrophoresis interpretation reference material
• Quality control materials
B. Preparation
1. Verify that all equipment and reagents are in working order and
not expired.
2. Prepare the electrophoresis gel according to manufacturer's
instructions.
3. Calibrate the electrophoresis apparatus if necessary.
4. Check that control samples are properly identified and
prepared.
5. Ensure all necessary personal protective equipment (PPE) is
worn.
C. Analytical Phase
1. Specimen Preparation
◦ Ensure that the patient sample is properly labeled.
◦ Use whole blood or hemolysate according to laboratory
standard procedure.
◦ Use appropriate controls with each run.
2. Loading the Electrophoresis Gel
◦ Load the control samples first in the designated wells.
◦ Load the patient samples into the appropriate lanes on the
electrophoresis gel.
◦ Ensure samples are loaded in a consistent volume to
ensure reliability and reproducibility.
3. Running Electrophoresis
◦ Set the electrophoresis apparatus to the required voltage
and duration as specified by the reagent system used.
◦ Start the run and monitor for any irregularities.
◦ Record start and end times in the laboratory logbook,
including any anomalies or interruptions experienced during
the run.
4. Post-Electrophoresis Staining
◦ Remove the gel from the apparatus carefully.
◦ Stain the gel according to the staining protocol specified by
the reagent provider.
◦ Destain the gel appropriately as outlined by the
manufacturer guidelines to enhance clarity of the bands.
5. Visualization
◦ Visualize the stained gel using appropriate instrumentation
(e.g., UV transilluminator or a suitable imaging system).
◦ Capture images of the gel for documentation and analysis.
6. Interpretation
◦ Compare the sample lanes with control samples to identify
different hemoglobin bands.
◦ Use the reference material to determine the relative mobility
and change in band intensity.
◦ Record the presence of normal and abnormal hemoglobin
fractions as observed.
D. Summary Interpretation
1. Documentation
◦ Document the hemoglobin variants and their respective
percentages identified.
◦ Record all relevant observations and potential interferences
encountered during the procedure in the laboratory
information system (LIS).
◦ Use structured reporting templates where available.
2. Report Generation
◦ Generate a preliminary report.
◦ Review the preliminary report to ensure accuracy and
completeness.
◦ Interpret findings in the context of the clinical background
provided. List any recommendations for follow-up testing if
needed.
3. Quality Control
◦ Verify results against positive and negative control samples
to ensure reliability.
◦ Document and address any deviations or anomalies in the
Quality Control Results Log.
4. Final Review
◦ Proceed with the final verification and validation of the
electrophoresis results by a qualified laboratory supervisor
or pathologist.
◦ Ensure the results and summary interpretations are
concisely recorded and communicated in the LIS.
5. Reporting Results
◦ Ensure results are verified and transmitted to the designated
clinician or healthcare provider via the LIS.
◦ Provide interpreted results according to the laboratory's
standard reporting guidelines.
4. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Report the hemoglobin variants in accordance with established
reference intervals for age, sex, and ethnic background where
applicable.
5. QUALITY CONTROL AND LIMITATIONS
• Analyze control samples with each batch to confirm that the
electrophoresis system is functioning correctly.
• Regularly inspect and maintain all electrophoresis
instrumentation.
• Critical results, instrument malfunctions, and unexpected findings
should be promptly communicated to the laboratory supervisor for
further action and documentation.
