STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP) FOR ANALYSIS OF
HEMOGLOBIN F DISTRIBUTION, BLOOD
1. PURPOSE: To provide a precise and reproducible method for
determining the distribution of Hemoglobin F (HbF) in blood
samples.
2. RESPONSIBILITY: Qualified medical laboratory scientists are
responsible for performing, documenting, and analyzing the
distribution of Hemoglobin F in blood samples as per this
protocol. The quality control supervisors are responsible for
monitoring accuracy and precision of the results and ensuring
all corrective actions are taken if results fall outside acceptable
limits.
3. SPECIMEN: Specimen requirements:
• Preferred: EDTA anticoagulated whole blood (lavender top tube)
• Acceptable: Sodium heparin anticoagulated whole blood (green
top tube)
Specimen stability:
• Specimens are stable at 2-8°C for 24 hours after collection.
• Unacceptable specimens: Clotted or hemolyzed samples,
specimens older than 24 hours, or specimens not maintained at
the correct temperature.
1. REAGENTS, EQUIPMENT, AND MATERIALS: 4.1 Reagents:
• Hemoglobin F staining solution/kits (validated for laboratory use)
• Control materials (positive and negative controls)
4.2 Equipment:
• Hemoglobin electrophoresis apparatus or HPLC system with
interface for HbF analysis
• Centrifuge (refrigerated)
• Automated hemoglobin analyzer
• Pipettes and tips
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
4.3 Materials:
• Sample tubes
• Pipette tips
• Gloves
• Laboratory coat
• Safety goggles
• Hemoglobin F control slides or membranes
• Hemoglobin standard solutions
1. PROCEDURE: Note: Hemoglobin F distribution can be
analyzed using different methods, such as HPLC (High-
Performance Liquid Chromatography) or gel electrophoresis.
The laboratory may use either method as long as it is
appropriately validated.
5.1 Sample Preparation:
• Gently mix the blood sample to ensure it is well-mixed.
• Aliquot appropriate blood volume for testing based on the method
used (HPLC or electrophoresis).
5.2 Analysis by HPLC Method:
• Calibrate the HPLC system with known standard hemoglobin
solutions as per manufacturer instructions.
• Load the patient sample into the HPLC system.
• Allow the system to run through the programmed cycle.
• Record the retention time and concentration of Hemoglobin F.
• Review chromatograms for any anomalies or technical issues.
5.3 Analysis by Electrophoresis Method:
• Gently homogenize the sample.
• Prepare electrophoresis gel as instructed in the electrophoresis kit
manual.
• Load the samples and appropriate controls onto the gel.
• Run the gel electrophoresis as per the manufacturer’s
recommended conditions.
• Stain the gel with HbF staining solution and de-stain appropriately.
• Document and interpret the band intensity for Hemoglobin F.
1. QUALITY CONTROL:
• Run positive and negative controls with each batch of patient
samples.
• Ensure the controls fall within established reference ranges
before validating patient results.
• Record control results in the quality control log.
• Ensure proper functioning of the equipment through regular
maintenance and calibration.
1. REPORTING RESULTS:
• Hemoglobin F percentage should be calculated and recorded
accurately.
• Verify results by comparing with reference controls.
• Report findings in the laboratory information system (LIS) using
the established verification protocol.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
• Ensure no particulate matter or hemolysis in the samples as it
may affect results.
• Variations in sample storage conditions can affect the integrity of
Hemoglobin F distribution results.
• Interferences from other hemoglobin variants should be
considered.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS:
• Normal Hemoglobin F levels: 0.0%-2.0% (may vary based on
laboratory standards and patient age)
1. TROUBLESHOOTING:
• If controls are not within range, investigate potential causes and
repeat the test as necessary.
• Consult instrument manuals for specific error messages and
corrective actions.
• Contact a supervisor or technical support if unable to resolve
issues.
