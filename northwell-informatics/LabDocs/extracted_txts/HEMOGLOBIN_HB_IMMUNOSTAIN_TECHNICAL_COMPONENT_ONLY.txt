Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Hemoglobin (HB)
Immunostain - Technical Component Only
1. PURPOSE
This procedure outlines the steps for performing the technical
component of Hemoglobin (HB) Immunostain in the laboratory to
ensure consistent and reliable results. This includes staining, quality
control, and reporting protocols.
1. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel responsible for
performing Hemoglobin (HB) Immunostain at the designated
laboratory.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of qualified personnel to perform and document
the Hemoglobin (HB) Immunostain according to this SOP.
Supervisors are responsible for ensuring all staff are trained and
competent in this procedure.
1. DEFINITION
Hemoglobin Immunostain is a staining process used in histology to
identify the presence of hemoglobin in tissue sections through the
use of specific antibodies.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Automated immunostainer or manual staining setup
• Microscope slides with tissue sections
• Primary antibody specific to hemoglobin
• Secondary antibody conjugated with a detection system (e.g.,
HRP, AP)
• Blocking buffer
• Staining reagents (DAB, colorimetric substrates)
• Counterstain (e.g., hematoxylin)
• Mounting medium
• Positive and negative control slides
• Deionized water
• Appropriate logbooks and documentation
1. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation of Reagents:
1. Prepare all reagents according to manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Ensure all reagents are within their expiration dates and have
been stored appropriately.
3. Label all reagents with date of preparation and expiration date.
B) Tissue Preparation:
1. Cut tissue sections at 3-5 micrometers and mount them on
positively charged microscope slides.
2. Bake slides at 60°C for 1 hour or as per laboratory protocol.
3. Deparaffinize and rehydrate tissue sections through xylene and
graded alcohol series to distilled water.
C) Staining Protocol:
1. Retrieve antigen by placing slides in a preheated retrieval
solution. Heat according to the protocol optimized for
hemoglobin antigen.
2. Cool slides to room temperature and rinse in deionized water.
3. Block endogenous peroxidase activity by incubating slides in
hydrogen peroxide solution for 10 minutes.
4. Rinse slides in deionized water followed by PBS or TBS wash
buffer.
5. Apply blocking buffer and incubate for 10-20 minutes.
6. Drain blocking buffer without washing and apply the primary
antibody, diluted according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
7. Incubate slides with primary antibody in a humidified chamber
for the recommended time (30-60 minutes at room temperature
or as optimized).
8. Rinse slides in PBS or TBS wash buffer.
9. Apply secondary antibody conjugated with the detection system
and incubate as per manufacturer's recommendations.
10. Rinse slides in wash buffer and apply chromogenic substrate
(e.g., DAB) until the desired color intensity is achieved (typically
5-10 minutes).
11. Rinse briefly in deionized water.
12. Counterstain with hematoxylin, rinse in water, and differentiate
in weak acid or ammonia solution if required.
13. Dehydrate slides through graded alcohol series, clear in xylene,
and coverslip with mounting medium.
D) Quality Control:
1. Run positive and negative control slides with each batch of
staining to ensure staining efficiency and specificity.
2. Document all results and observations in the appropriate QC
logbook.
E) Reporting Results:
1. Technical personnel are responsible for generating the visual
results; no interpretation is provided in the technical component
only.
2. Ensure all staining results are properly documented and slides
are appropriately labeled.
3. SAMPLE INTEGRITY
4. Ensure tissue samples are processed promptly to avoid
degradation. Any issues with sample quality should be
documented, and the requesting physician should be notified.
5. MAINTENANCE AND TROUBLESHOOTING
6. Follow daily, weekly, and monthly maintenance schedules for all
equipment as per manufacturer’s instructions.
7. Maintain a log of any issues, corrective actions, and routine
maintenance.
8. In case of troubleshooting, refer to the manufacturer’s guide
and consult with the supervisor as necessary.
9. REFERENCES
Include all relevant manuals, insertion guides from reagent
manufacturers, and other literature used in developing this SOP.
1. ATTACHMENTS
Include any forms, logs, or checklists that are referenced in this
procedure.
By following this protocol, consistent and accurate technical
performance of Hemoglobin (HB) Immunostain will be ensured.
