Standard Operating Procedure Hemoglobin Analysis in Plasma
Samples
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedures for the
measurement of hemoglobin levels in plasma samples. This protocol
ensures accurate, precise, and reproducible results that are
compliant with CLIA standards.
Responsibility:
Designated clinical laboratory staff are responsible for performing the
hemoglobin analysis of plasma samples as described in this SOP. It
is also their responsibility to report any deviations from the
established protocols to the supervisor immediately and take
corrective action as outlined in this document.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Preferred/Acceptable Specimen:
• Plasma samples collected in EDTA, heparinized, or citrate
vacutainers.
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric plasma samples.
• Sample without proper labeling (patient information and collection
time).
Storage:
• Plasma samples should be stored at 2-8°C if not analyzed
immediately, and must be analyzed within 24 hours of collection.
• For longer storage, freeze samples at -20°C. Thaw samples to
room temperature before analysis.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Hemoglobin analyzer (e.g., Hemocue Hb 201+ or equivalent)
• Micropipettes and tips
• Centrifuge
Reagents:
• Hemoglobin standards and controls
• Diluent specific to the hemoglobin analyzer in use
Supplies:
• Clear, clean plastic or glass cuvettes
• Calibrated volumetric pipettes
• Tubes for sample preparation
1. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation:
1. Ensure the plasma sample is at room temperature. If frozen,
thaw and mix thoroughly.
2. Centrifuge the sample at 2500-3000 rpm for 10 minutes to
remove any residual cells or debris.
B. Calibration:
1. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for calibrating the
hemoglobin analyzer with hemoglobin standards.
2. Perform calibration at the beginning of each shift and after
every 20 samples.
C. Quality Control:
1. Run two levels of quality controls (QC) - one normal and one
abnormal - before running patient samples.
2. Document QC results in the Quality Control Log.
3. If QC fails, troubleshoot according to the analyzer’s manual
before proceeding with patient samples.
D. Hemoglobin Analysis:
1. Mix the plasma sample gently by inversion.
2. Pipette the required volume (usually 10 µL) of plasma into a
clean cuvette.
3. Add the appropriate volume of diluent (as specified by the
analyzer manual) into the cuvette and mix gently.
4. Insert the cuvette into the hemoglobin analyzer.
5. Record the results once the reading has stabilized.
E. Troubleshooting:
1. If results are outside of the expected ranges or error messages
are displayed, repeat the analysis.
2. If problems persist, consult the analyzer manual for
troubleshooting tips or contact technical support.
3. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results are documented in the LIS system.
• Evaluate hemoglobin values according to the established
reference ranges: Normal Range: 13.5-17.5 g/dL (male),
12.0-15.5 g/dL (female), 11.0-14.0 g/dL (children).
• Flag any critical or out-of-range results per the laboratory's critical
value policy.
• Ensure results are reviewed and verified by the technologist
before reporting.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• QC materials should be stored and handled according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
• Document any corrective actions taken in the QC log.
• Perform bi-weekly intra-lab comparisons and monthly inter-lab
comparisons to ensure consistency and reliability.
