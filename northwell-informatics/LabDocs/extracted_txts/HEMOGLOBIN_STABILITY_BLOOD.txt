STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP) For Hemoglobin
Stability, Blood
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this document is to outline the procedures for the
generation of results for Hemoglobin Stability in blood samples. This
SOP ensures consistent, accurate, and reliable results while
complying with relevant guidelines and regulations.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing and
documenting the Hemoglobin Stability test according to this protocol.
Supervisors are responsible for ensuring that the procedures are
followed and that all necessary corrective actions are implemented
when required.
1. DEFINITION
Hemoglobin Stability Testing evaluates the stability of hemoglobin in
blood samples at various time points to determine the longevity and
integrity of hemoglobin within a given period under controlled
conditions.
1. PROCEDURE
A) Specimen Requirements and Stability
1. Collect 5 mL of whole blood in an EDTA tube.
2. Ensure samples are mixed thoroughly by gentle inversion 8-10
times immediately after collection.
3. Samples must be received in the laboratory within 4 hours of
collection.
4. If there is a delay in testing, store samples at 2-8°C. The
stability of hemoglobin should be assessed at defined intervals
(e.g., 0 hr, 24 hrs, 48 hrs, and 72 hrs) post-collection.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Samples received more than 4 hours post-collection if not
refrigerated.
• Samples received more than 72 hours post-collection.
• Samples with visible hemolysis.
B) Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies
• Hemoglobin analyzer (e.g., HemoCue Hb 201+ or equivalent)
• EDTA tubes (lavender top)
• Calibrated micropipettes and tips
• Calibration standards and controls
• Hemoglobin stability testing log sheet
C) Calibration and Quality Control
1. Perform calibration of the hemoglobin analyzer as per
manufacturer’s instructions before initial use and as required
based on manufacturer's recommendation.
2. Run quality control (QC) samples at low, normal, and high
levels of hemoglobin at the beginning of each day of testing and
every 8 hours during continuous testing.
3. Document all QC results in the Hemoglobin Stability Testing log.
Evaluate QC results to ensure they are within acceptable
ranges before proceeding with patient sample testing.
D) Testing Procedure
1. Label tubes with corresponding time points (e.g., 0 hr, 24 hrs,
48 hrs, and 72 hrs).
2. Mix each sample by gentle inversion before analysis.
3. Calibrate the hemoglobin analyzer according to the
manufacturer's directions.
4. Using a calibrated micropipette, draw 10 µL of blood sample.
5. Load the sample into the hemoglobin analyzer for analysis.
6. Record the hemoglobin concentration for each sample in the
Hemoglobin Stability Testing log, including the time of analysis
and initials of the person performing the test.
7. Repeat steps 4-6 for each time-point sample.
E) Data Analysis and Interpretation
1. Compare hemoglobin concentration values obtained at different
time points to determine stability.
2. An acceptable hemoglobin stability test result should show
minimal variance (e.g., <5%) between initial measurement (0
hr) and subsequent time points.
3. If significant degradation (>5%) is observed over time,
investigate potential pre-analytical, analytical, or post-analytical
factors and document findings.
F) Reporting Results
1. Hemoglobin stability results should be recorded in the patient’s
file.
2. Report any abnormal results to the appropriate healthcare
provider immediately.
G) Corrective Actions
1. In the event of an equipment malfunction or QC failure,
investigate and document the issue. Repeat testing if
necessary.
2. If hemoglobin stability is not maintained, assess sample
collection, storage, and handling procedures for potential errors
and implement corrective measures.
H) Documentation
1. Use the Hemoglobin Stability Testing log to document all
pertinent data.
2. Ensure all logs, calibration records, and QC records are
maintained and available for review.
