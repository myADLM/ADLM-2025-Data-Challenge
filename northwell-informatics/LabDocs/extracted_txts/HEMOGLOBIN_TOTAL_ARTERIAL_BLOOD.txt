Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Hemoglobin, Total, Arterial, Blood
1. PURPOSE This procedure describes the steps necessary to
generate accurate and reliable results for the measurement of total
hemoglobin in arterial blood samples using an automated
hematology analyzer.
2. SCOPE This protocol applies to all personnel in the designated
CLIA-certified laboratory who are trained to operate the hematology
analyzer and handle arterial blood specimens.
3. RESPONSIBILITY It is the responsibility of the medical laboratory
scientist to follow this protocol accurately and ensure the proper
handling and analysis of arterial blood samples. The laboratory
supervisor is responsible for ensuring all staff are adequately trained
and adhering to this protocol.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• Automated Hematology Analyzer
• Reagents specific to hemoglobin analysis (as specified by the
manufacturer)
• Quality control materials
• PPE (gloves, lab coat, safety glasses)
• Sterile syringes for blood sample collection
• Heparinized arterial blood gas syringes
• Biohazard disposal containers
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen type: Arterial blood
• Acceptable collection devices: Heparinized arterial blood gas
syringes
• Volume: Minimum 1 mL
• Specimen stability: Analyze within 30 minutes of collection for
optimal accuracy. If delay is expected, keep the specimen on ice
and analyze within 2 hours.
6. PROCEDURE A. Specimen Collection:
1. Collect arterial blood using a heparinized syringe.
2. Ensure there are no air bubbles within the syringe.
3. Mix the sample gently but thoroughly to prevent clotting.
4. Label the syringe with patient identification, date, and time of
collection.
B. Sample Preparation:
1. Bring the blood specimen to room temperature if it has been
stored on ice.
2. Continue mixing the sample gently to ensure homogeneity
before analysis.
C. Quality Control:
1. Perform quality control procedures as per hematology analyzer
manufacturer's instructions.
2. Use appropriate control materials (normal, high, low) and
document results.
3. Do not proceed with patient sample analysis if quality control
results are outside acceptable limits.
D. Instrument Setup:
1. Power on the automated hematology analyzer and allow it to
perform its initial system check.
2. Ensure reagents are loaded and ready for use.
3. Confirm that the analyzer is correctly calibrated.
E. Analysis:
1. Place a clean sample probe or capillary into the heparinized
arterial blood sample.
2. Follow the analyzer’s instructions for loading and initiating the
test run.
3. The analyzer will aspirate a small volume of blood and proceed
with the total hemoglobin determination.
4. Record the generated hemoglobin results from the analyzer
display.
5. Save or print the result report as required by laboratory
protocol.
F. Result Evaluation:
1. Review the hemoglobin result for any analyzer error messages
or unusual findings.
2. Ensure the result falls within the expected physiological range:
◦ Adult males: 13.8 to 17.2 g/dL
◦ Adult females: 12.1 to 15.1 g/dL
◦ Reference ranges may vary by laboratory; verify with local
standards.
G. Reporting Results:
1. Enter the result into the Laboratory Information System (LIS) for
patient's electronic medical records (EMR).
2. Ensure any critical values are communicated to the clinician
promptly as per the laboratory’s critical value policy.
7. QUALITY ASSURANCE & TROUBLESHOOTING
• If there is a discrepancy between expected and obtained QC
results, initiate troubleshooting steps including re-calibration of the
analyzer and re-running the controls.
• If analytical errors occur, document the issue and corrective
actions taken, notify the supervisor if necessary.
8. SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS
• Always wear appropriate PPE.
• Handle all specimens as potentially infectious.
• Dispose of biohazard waste following OSHA and laboratory safety
guidelines.

11. REVIEW AND REVISION
• This procedure should be reviewed annually and updated as
needed based on advancements in technology, updated
regulatory requirements, or laboratory needs.
