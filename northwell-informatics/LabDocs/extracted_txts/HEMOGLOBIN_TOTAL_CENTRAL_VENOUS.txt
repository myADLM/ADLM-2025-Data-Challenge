Standard Operating Procedure (SOP):
Analytical Phase for Generating Results
for Hemoglobin Total, Central Venous
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for analyzing hemoglobin total in central
venous blood samples and generating accurate results.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of all trained laboratory personnel to perform
the analysis of hemoglobin total, central venous samples following
this standard operating procedure (SOP). It is also the responsibility
of the staff to document all results accurately and initiate corrective
actions as needed to maintain the integrity of the laboratory results.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen Type: - Central Venous Blood
Collection Requirements: - Lithium heparinized blood gas syringe or
heparinized vacutainer (dark green or PST) tubes - Ensure syringes
are emptied of air, capped, and adequately mixed. - Specimens
should be transported to the laboratory immediately after collection to
avoid degradation.
Unacceptable Specimens: - Specimens containing significant air
bubbles (>10% of specimen volume). - Specimens with clotted blood.
- Specimens collected in sodium citrate, sodium fluoride/oxalate, or
EDTA. - Specimens with the needle still attached or showing signs of
hemolysis. - PST specimens are not preferred and should be used
only in emergency situations.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Reception and Preparation: 1. Upon receipt, log the
sample into the laboratory information system (LIS) and label
appropriately. 2. Inspect the specimen for clots, air bubbles, and
integrity. Reject unacceptable specimens following the guidelines
above and notify the proper personnel. 3. Mix well by rolling the
capped syringe or tube gently.
B. Analytical Measurement: 1. Use the designated hematology
analyzer following the manufacturer's instructions. 2. Perform daily
quality control checks on the analyzer to ensure accuracy. Document
QC results in the appropriate log. 3. Load the appropriate reagent
pack for hemoglobin and execute a calibration cycle to ensure the
accuracy of the measurement. 4. Aspirate the sample into the
analyzer, ensuring no air bubbles are present in the sample path.
C. Quality Control: 1. Run multi-level control materials alongside
patient samples to verify instrument performance. 2. Document
control results and confirm they fall within acceptable limits
predefined by the laboratory. 3. Address any control material failures
by re-testing or recalibrating the analyzer as necessary before
proceeding with patient samples.
D. Reporting Results: 1. Once the hemoglobin total measurement is
complete, review the results for any flags or quality issues. 2.
Compare measured hemoglobin values with established reference
ranges, noting any critical values requiring immediate medical
intervention. 3. Transmit verified results to the LIS. Confirm that
results are correctly entered and note any anomalies or uncertainties.
4. Print a copy of the results for record-keeping in accordance with
laboratory policy.
E. Sample Integrity: 1. If sample integrity is questioned (e.g.,
hemolysis), centrifuge a small aliquot and inspect it for integrity
issues. 2. Decisions on sample integrity will be based on the
technologist’s professional judgment. Note any issues on the
sample's document.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Reference Ranges: - Adult Males: 13.5 to 17.5 g/dL - Adult Females:
12.0 to 15.5 g/dL (values might differ based on the specific
laboratory's reference ranges)
1. QUALITY CONTROL AND TROUBLESHOOTING
A. Calibration and Validation: 1. Calibrate the analyzer at the start of
each shift and whenever a new reagent lot is introduced. 2. Perform
periodic validation studies comparing results on different analyzers
when necessary.
B. Critical Results Handling: 1. Hemoglobin levels falling outside the
emergency critical thresholds should be flagged: - Critically Low: <7.0
g/dL - Critically High: >20.0 g/dL 2. Report critical values immediately
to the treating physician or responsible healthcare provider and
document the communication.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Method-specific limitations, interferences, and aberrations in the
hemoglobin analysis procedure should be considered and referred to
in the manufacturer's instruction manual for the specific analyzer in
use.
1. RECORD KEEPING
Maintain meticulous logs of all calibrations, quality control results,
patient results, and communications regarding critical values as per
laboratory SOPs and accrediting agency requirements.
1. REFERENCES
Refer to the analyzer’s operator's manual and standard laboratory
reference texts for additional guidance on procedures and
troubleshooting.
1. REVIEW AND REVISION
This standard operating procedure shall be reviewed annually or as
necessary to incorporate new validations, technologies, or protocol
alterations. The current version as per approval is effective from the
date noted below:
