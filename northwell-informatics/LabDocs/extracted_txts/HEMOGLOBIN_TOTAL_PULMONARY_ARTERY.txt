Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Hemoglobin Total Results for Pulmonary Artery
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the analytical procedure for
generating hemoglobin total (Hgb) results from pulmonary artery
samples. This includes the handling, processing, analysis, and
reporting of the results to ensure accuracy and reliability.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for following the
procedures outlined in this SOP. All staff must ensure that proper
protocols are followed during the analytical phase to maintain the
integrity and accuracy of test results.
2. DEFINITIONS
• Hemoglobin Total (Hgb): Hemoglobin is the protein in red blood
cells that carries oxygen around the body. Hemoglobin total refers
to the measurement of all hemoglobin pigments in the blood.
• Pulmonary Artery Sample: Blood sample collected from the
pulmonary artery, usually used to assess pulmonary circulation
and oxygenation.
3. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
• Hemoglobin analyzer (specific model and manufacturer to be
listed)
• Appropriate calibrators and control materials
• Heparinized syringe or collection tube for pulmonary artery
samples
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
• Iris diaphragm or colorimeter
• Laboratory timer
• Sample cups or vials
4. SPECIMEN
Preferred/Acceptable:
• Pulmonary artery blood sample collected in a heparinized syringe
or tube.
• Sample should be transported to the laboratory immediately after
collection to prevent degradation or clotting.
Unacceptable:
• Specimens received in non-heparinized tubes or syringes.
• Specimens with significant air bubbles.
• Clotted or hemolyzed specimens.
• Specimens not properly labeled or lacking collection date/time.
5. PROCEDURE
A) Specimen Handling
1. Upon receipt, check the specimen for labeling accuracy
including patient identification, collection date, and time.
2. Log the specimen into the laboratory information system (LIS).
B) Sample Preparation
1. Ensure the sample is well-mixed by gently rolling the syringe or
inverting the collection tube several times.
2. Inspect the sample for air bubbles or clots. If present, reject the
sample and request a new one.
3. Transfer the required volume of blood to an appropriate sample
cup or vial if not already in one.
C) Instrument Calibration and Quality Control
1. Calibrate the hemoglobin analyzer according to the
manufacturer’s instructions using appropriate calibrators.
2. Run quality control (QC) samples at defined levels (e.g., low,
normal, and high) to ensure the analyzer is functioning
correctly.
3. Document the QC results in the QC log. If QC is out of range,
troubleshoot and recalibrate the instrument as necessary.
D) Analysis
1. Load the sample into the hemoglobin analyzer following the
manufacturer’s protocol.
2. Initiate the analysis and allow the analyzer to process the
sample.
E) Reporting Results
1. Review the analyzer output for the hemoglobin total result.
2. If the result is flagged or appears unusual, repeat the analysis
with a new aliquot of the same sample.
3. Once verified, enter the results into the LIS.
4. Document any issues or deviations from standard protocol and
notify the supervisor if repeated errors occur.
6. QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE
Internal Quality Control (IQC):
• Perform IQC with each new batch of reagents and whenever the
instrument is recalibrated.
• Verify that IQC results are within acceptable limits before testing
patient samples.
External Quality Assessment (EQA):
• Participate in EQA programs to ensure external validation of test
accuracy.
7. MAINTENANCE
• Perform routine maintenance on the hemoglobin analyzer as per
the manufacturer’s guidelines.
• Document all maintenance activities in the maintenance log.
8. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If the instrument reports an error or the results are out of the
expected range, follow the troubleshooting guide provided by the
manufacturer.
• Common issues include sample clotting, air bubbles, and
calibration errors. Address these specific issues by repeating the
sample preparation process or recalibrating the instrument as
needed.
9. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s user manual and calibration instructions for the
hemoglobin analyzer.
• Hemoglobin measurement guidelines and standard practices.
10. DOCUMENTATION AND RECORD KEEPING
• All calibration, quality control, maintenance, and patient test
results should be documented and maintained as per laboratory
policy for record-keeping and traceability.
• Ensure compliance with CLIA, CAP, and other relevant regulatory
standards.
By adhering to this SOP, the laboratory ensures reliable, accurate,
and timely hemoglobin total test results from pulmonary artery
samples, thus contributing to effective patient care and management.
