Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Hemoglobin, Total, Venous,
Blood
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to provide a clear and standardized
method for the analytical phase of generating results for Hemoglobin,
Total, Venous, Blood. This protocol ensures accuracy, precision, and
consistency in test results.
Responsibility:
All designated staff are responsible for performing the test as per this
SOP and ensuring that all controls and standards are met. It is the
responsibility of the supervisor to review the results and address any
issues that arise.
1. DEFINITION
Hemoglobin, Total, Venous, Blood refers to the measurement of total
hemoglobin concentration in a venous blood sample.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred Specimen: 5 mL venous blood collected in a lavender-
top (EDTA) tube.
• Specimen Stability: Samples should be analyzed within 4 hours of
collection if kept at room temperature; within 24 hours if
refrigerated (2-8°C).
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Hematology analyzer (e.g., Sysmex XN-Series, Beckman Coulter
UniCel DxH)
• Calibrated pipettes
• Quality control materials (QC)
• Commercial hemoglobin standards
• EDTA tubes
• PPE (Personal Protective Equipment) including gloves, lab coat,
and safety glasses
1. PROCEDURE
A) Sample Preparation:
1. Ensure the venous blood sample is properly labeled with the
patient’s name, collection date, and time.
2. Gently invert the EDTA tube 8-10 times to ensure proper mixing
of blood with the anticoagulant.
3. Inspect the sample for any clots or hemolysis. Reject any
clotted or hemolyzed samples following the specimen rejection
criteria.
B) Calibration and Quality Control:
1. Calibrate the hematology analyzer using the manufacturer’s
calibration procedure.
2. Run quality control materials at the beginning of each shift, after
calibration, and as recommended by the manufacturer.
3. Record QC results. Ensure that the QC results fall within the
acceptable range. If not, troubleshoot and rectify any issues
before proceeding with patient samples.
C) Analysis:
1. Select the appropriate test for Hemoglobin, Total on the
hematology analyzer.
2. Place the sample tube in the analyzer’s sample holder.
3. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions to start the analysis.
4. Allow the analyzer to process the sample and generate the
hemoglobin result.
5. Once the analysis is complete, verify the results displayed on
the analyzer.
D) Result Verification and Reporting:
1. Cross-check sample identification to ensure correct matching of
patient results.
2. Verify results for any flags or warnings. If flagged, troubleshoot
according to the manufacturer’s guidelines.
3. Record the hemoglobin value in the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
4. Report the results following the laboratory’s reporting
guidelines, including reference ranges and critical values.
E) Maintenance and Troubleshooting:
1. Perform daily, weekly, and monthly maintenance of the
hematology analyzer as per the manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Document all maintenance and any troubleshooting actions
taken.
3. In case of persistent instrument issues or unexpected results,
consult the technical support team of the analyzer's
manufacturer for assistance.
4. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Adults: 13.5-17.5 g/dL (Male) 12.0-15.5 g/dL (Female)
• Pediatrics: Age-specific reference intervals as defined by the
laboratory.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolysis, clotting, or improper mixing of blood samples may
impact the accuracy of results.
• Lipemia or high levels of bilirubin may interfere with hemoglobin
measurements.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Use two levels of QC material (normal and abnormal) during each
testing run.
• Review all QC data to ensure it is within the acceptable range
before reporting patient results.
• Take corrective action if QC results are out of range, including
repeating the run or recalibrating the instrument.

1. REVISION HISTORY
• Version 1.0: Initial Release (October 2023)
This protocol ensures accurate and reliable hemoglobin
measurement in venous blood samples, aligning with the laboratory’s
quality management system and regulatory requirements.
