Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Title: Analytical Phase for
Hemoglobin Variant, A2 and F Quantitation, Blood
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this SOP is to outline the
procedures for the analytical phase of generating results for
Hemoglobin Variant, A2 and F Quantitation in blood. This
includes equipment setup, sample preparation, analysis, quality
control, and result reporting.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory personnel will follow this procedure to
ensure accurate and reliable results.
• It is the responsibility of all laboratory staff to adhere to this SOP
and report any deviations to their supervisor.
1. EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS
• High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) System
specifically configured for hemoglobin variant analysis.
• Hemoglobin Variant Control Material (Bio-Rad, Sebia, etc.)
• Hemoglobin A2/F kit and related reagents (following
manufacturer’s recommendations)
• Laboratory Information System (LIS)
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
1. PROCEDURE
A. Calibration and Preparation
1. Ensure the HPLC system is properly calibrated and maintained
according to manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Verify that all reagents and control materials are within their
expiration dates and have been stored properly.
3. Prepare the HPLC system by priming the system with the
appropriate buffers and reagents necessary for the analysis.
4. Perform a system suitability test using a control sample to
ensure the HPLC system is functioning properly.
B. Sample Preparation
1. Receive blood specimens and ensure they are properly labeled
and meet acceptance criteria (e.g., EDTA anticoagulated whole
blood).
2. Mix each specimen thoroughly to ensure uniformity.
3. Prepare hemolysates according to the manufacturer’s
instructions for the Hemoglobin A2/F kit.
C. Analysis
1. Load the prepared hemolysates and control materials into the
HPLC sample tray.
2. Follow the software prompts to begin the analysis.
3. Ensure the correct sequence and settings for hemoglobin
variant analysis are selected in the HPLC software.
4. Monitor the analysis process to detect any anomalies in real-
time.
D. Quality Control
1. Run control samples at the beginning and end of each batch of
patient samples.
2. Ensure that QC materials fall within the established target
ranges.
3. Document all QC results in the Temperature Monitoring Log.
4. If any QC result falls outside the target range, troubleshoot the
issue before proceeding with the analysis of patient samples.
5. Notify the supervisor if the issue persists.
E. Result Interpretation and Reporting
1. Upon completion of the analysis, review the chromatograms
and quantitative data for each sample.
2. For each sample, identify and quantify the hemoglobin variants,
including Hemoglobin A2 and F, using the HPLC software.
3. Compare the patient results with the reference intervals
provided by the manufacturer.
4. For any abnormalities or unexpected findings, perform
necessary troubleshooting steps and consult with a supervisor
if needed.
5. Enter and verify the results into the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
6. Ensure all results are reviewed and validated by a laboratory
technologist.
7. MAINTENANCE AND TROUBLESHOOTING
8. Follow the manufacturer’s recommended maintenance
schedule for the HPLC system.
9. Document all maintenance activities in the instrument log.
10. In the event of instrument malfunction or inconsistent results,
refer to the troubleshooting section of the HPLC operation
manual.
11. Notify the supervisor and log all troubleshooting steps taken.
12. SAFETY
13. Follow all laboratory safety protocols, including the use of PPE.
14. Dispose of all biological and chemical waste according to
established lab procedures.
