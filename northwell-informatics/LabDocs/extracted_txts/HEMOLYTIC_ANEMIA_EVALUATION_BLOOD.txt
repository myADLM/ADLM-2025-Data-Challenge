1. PURPOSE
To provide accurate and timely results in the evaluation of hemolytic
anemia using laboratory tests on blood specimens.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
All designated staff must follow this procedure and ensure the
integrity and accuracy of results. It is the responsibility of the
technologist performing the tests and their supervisor to identify any
deviations or issues and rectify them promptly.
3. DEFINITION
Hemolytic anemia evaluation involves laboratory tests to detect
increased destruction of red blood cells (RBCs) and to identify
underlying causes of hemolysis.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred Specimen: Whole blood collected in an EDTA (lavender-
top) tube.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Clotted specimens
• Hemolyzed specimens (if hemolysis is not part of the evaluative
process)
• Specimens not labeled with collection date/time
Specimen Stability: Specimens must be analyzed within 48 hours of
collection.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Automated Hematology Analyzer (e.g., Sysmex XN-Series)
• Microscope
• Reagents for peripheral blood smear
• EDTA blood collection tubes
• Reagents for reticulocyte and bilirubin measurement
• Controls for quality assessment
6. PROCEDURE
Step 1: Complete Blood Count (CBC)
1. Perform CBC on the automated hematology analyzer according
to the manufacturer's instructions.
2. Review results for anemia (low hemoglobin/hematocrit) and
signs of hemolysis (elevated reticulocyte count, presence of
schistocytes).
3. Document results including RBC indices.
Step 2: Peripheral Blood Smear
1. Prepare a peripheral blood smear using a few drops of
collected blood.
2. Stain the smear using Wright-Giemsa stain.
3. Examine the smear under the microscope for morphological
abnormalities (e.g., schistocytes, spherocytes, reticulocytes).
4. Document findings and compare with analyzer results for
consistency.
Step 3: Reticulocyte Count
1. Perform a reticulocyte count using the automated hematology
analyzer.
2. Confirm elevated reticulocyte count indicative of hemolysis.
3. Document the percentage of reticulocytes and absolute
reticulocyte count.
Step 4: Bilirubin Measurement
1. Measure bilirubin levels using an appropriate analyzer (e.g.,
clinical chemistry analyzer).
2. Elevated unconjugated bilirubin can suggest hemolysis.
3. Document total and unconjugated bilirubin levels.
Step 5: LDH Measurement
1. Measure lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels using an
appropriate analyzer.
2. Elevated LDH levels can indicate hemolysis.
3. Document LDH levels.
Step 6: Haptoglobin Measurement
1. Measure serum haptoglobin levels using an appropriate
analyzer.
2. Decreased haptoglobin levels can confirm hemolysis.
3. Document haptoglobin levels.
Step 7: Confirmatory Tests
1. Perform additional confirmatory tests as required (e.g., direct
Coombs test for autoimmune hemolytic anemia, G6PD assay
for enzymatic deficiency).
2. Follow standard protocols for each test.
3. Document results and interpret in conjunction with initial
findings.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Run appropriate quality control materials for all analyzers at the
start of each shift and document results.
2. Validate all critical results with manual methods when
necessary.
3. Review and document any discrepancies, and notify designated
supervisors in case of significant deviations.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Review and verify results in the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
2. Report findings following site-specific reporting guidelines.
3. Include all relevant details and interpretive comments.
9. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Hemoglobin: 13.8-17.2 g/dL (Men), 12.1-15.1 g/dL (Women)
• Reticulocytes: 0.5-2.5%
• Bilirubin, Total: 0.1-1.2 mg/dL
• LDH: 140-280 U/L
• Haptoglobin: 30-200 mg/dL

Refer to the manufacturer's inserts for individual test limitations and
interferences.
