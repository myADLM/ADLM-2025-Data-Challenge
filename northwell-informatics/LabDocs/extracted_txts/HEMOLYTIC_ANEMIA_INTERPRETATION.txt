Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Hemolytic Anemia Interpretation
1. PURPOSE
To ensure the accurate and reliable interpretation of hemolytic
anemia based on laboratory test results which include a complete
blood count (CBC) with differential, reticulocyte count, peripheral
smear evaluation, bilirubin levels, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH),
haptoglobin, and direct antiglobulin test (DAT).
Responsibility:
• Laboratory personnel are responsible for conducting and verifying
all tests related to the hemolytic anemia profile.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring that laboratory
procedures are performed correctly and in compliance with the
standard operating procedures (SOPs).
2. DEFINITION
Hemolytic anemia is a condition in which red blood cells are
destroyed faster than they can be produced. Laboratory tests and
interpretation are crucial for the diagnosis and management of this
condition.
3. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Requirements:
• Specimens Required:
◦ Whole Blood: Collected in EDTA tubes for CBC, reticulocyte
count, and peripheral smear.
◦ Serum or Plasma: Collected in SST or heparinized tubes for
bilirubin, LDH, and haptoglobin levels.
◦ Whole Blood: Collected in EDTA tubes for DAT.
• Unacceptable Samples:
◦ Any hemolyzed samples (with the exception of samples
collected for hemolysis evaluation).
◦ Clotted samples for tests requiring plasma or whole blood.
B. Complete Blood Count (CBC):
• Equipment and Reagents:
◦ Automated Hematology Analyzer (e.g., Sysmex XN-Series).
◦ EDTA Whole Blood Sample.
• Procedure:
1. Mix the EDTA sample well by gently inverting 8-10 times.
2. Run a CBC with differential on the hematology analyzer.
3. Verify abnormal results with a manual differential if
necessary.
4. Record all findings in the laboratory information system
(LIS).
C. Reticulocyte Count:
• Equipment and Reagents:
◦ Flow Cytometry or Reticulocyte Counter.
◦ EDTA Whole Blood Sample.
• Procedure:
1. Mix EDTA sample thoroughly.
2. Perform the reticulocyte count.
3. Record reticulocyte percentage and absolute count.
D. Peripheral Smear Evaluation:
• Equipment and Reagents:
◦ Microscope.
◦ Stains: Wright-Giemsa or similar.
◦ Glass slides.
• Procedure:
1. Prepare a blood smear and stain it using Wright-Giemsa
stain.
2. Examine the smear under a microscope.
3. Evaluate for signs of hemolysis, such as schistocytes,
spherocytes, and polychromasia.
4. Document findings in the LIS.
E. Bilirubin (Total and Indirect):
• Equipment and Reagents:
◦ Biochemistry Analyzer.
◦ Serum or Plasma Sample.
◦ Bilirubin Reagent Kits.
• Procedure:
1. Centrifuge and separate serum or plasma from whole blood.
2. Perform bilirubin test using appropriate reagents and
protocols.
3. Record total and indirect bilirubin levels.
F. Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH):
• Equipment and Reagents:
◦ Biochemistry Analyzer.
◦ Serum or Plasma Sample.
◦ LDH Reagent Kits.
• Procedure:
1. Prepare and run LDH test on the biochemistry analyzer.
2. Record LDH levels and validate results.
G. Haptoglobin:
• Equipment and Reagents:
◦ Biochemistry Analyzer.
◦ Serum Sample.
◦ Haptoglobin Reagent Kits.
• Procedure:
1. Perform haptoglobin test as per analyzer instructions.
2. Document haptoglobin level.
H. Direct Antiglobulin Test (DAT):
• Equipment and Reagents:
◦ Coombs Reagent.
◦ Centrifuge.
◦ Microscope.
• Procedure:
1. Mix blood with Coombs reagent.
2. Centrifuge and examine for agglutination.
3. Record DAT results (positive or negative).
4. QUALITY CONTROL:
• Verify calibration of all equipment using control samples and
follow manufacturer’s guidelines.
• Perform biweekly and monthly QC checks as per the laboratory
QC protocol.
• Document QC results and take corrective actions if controls fall
out of acceptable range.
5. REPORTING RESULTS:
• Review results for consistency and accuracy prior to entry into the
LIS.
• Verify critical results and call results if they meet the laboratory’s
critical value policy.
• Record all results in LIS, ensuring comprehensive documentation
for interpretation.
6. REFERENCE INTERVALS:
• CBC: As per established laboratory reference ranges.
• Reticulocyte Count: 0.5% to 2.5% of RBCs
• Bilirubin:
◦ Total: up to 1.2 mg/dL (20.5 μmol/L)
◦ Indirect: 0.2 to 1.0 mg/dL (3.4 to 17.1 μmol/L)
• LDH: 125 to 220 U/L
• Haptoglobin: 30 to 200 mg/dL
• DAT: Negative
7. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
• Analytic sensitivity and specificity vary by test; ensure
interpretation corroborates clinical findings.
• Hemolyzed samples may affect the accurate measurement of
bilirubin and LDH.
8. REFERENCES:
• Manufacturer’s instructions for respective analyzers.
• Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines.
• Relevant medical and laboratory reference materials.
9. DOCUMENTATION:
• Ensure all procedure steps, findings, controls, and corrective
actions are documented accurately.
• Maintain records in accordance with laboratory and regulatory
requirements.
