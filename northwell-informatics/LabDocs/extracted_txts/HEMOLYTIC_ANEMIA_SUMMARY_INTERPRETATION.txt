Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Hemolytic Anemia Summary Interpretation
1. PURPOSE
To ensure accurate and consistent generation of results and
interpretation for hemolytic anemia, including the identification of
potential hemolytic conditions and the accurate communication of
such findings.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
The Medical Laboratory Scientist (MLS) is responsible for performing
the necessary tests, analyzing the results, interpreting the data, and
ensuring that quality control measures are adhered to. Supervisors
are responsible for reviewing and verifying any critical or complex
cases.
1. DEFINITION
Hemolytic anemia: Anemia due to excessive destruction of red blood
cells (RBCs).
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
◦ Preferred specimens: EDTA anticoagulated whole blood.
◦ Stability: Specimens should be processed within 24 hours of
collection. If delayed, store at 2-8°C and process within 48
hours.
2. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
◦ Hematology analyzer (e.g., Sysmex XN-Series)
◦ Reagents and controls specific to the hematology analyzer
◦ Manual differential equipment (microscope, slides, stains,
etc.)
◦ Coomb’s reagent (Anti-human globulin reagent)
◦ Supplies for additional tests such as LDH, bilirubin,
haptoglobin, and reticulocyte count
3. PROCEDURE
A) Sample Preparation and Initial Testing: 1. Verify patient
identification and specimen labeling according to laboratory
protocols. 2. Ensure specimens are at room temperature before
analysis. 3. Mix EDTA whole blood samples gently to avoid
hemolysis.
B) Hematology Analyzer Testing: 1. Perform a complete blood count
(CBC) with reticulocyte count using the hematology analyzer. 2.
Confirm results and check for flags indicating potential hemolysis
(e.g., elevated reticulocytes, low hemoglobin, elevated mean
corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC)).
C) Manual Differential and Morphological Examination: 1. Prepare
blood smears and perform Wright-Giemsa staining. 2. Review the
smeared slides under a microscope and assess RBC morphology for
signs of hemolysis (e.g., schistocytes, spherocytes, bite cells). 3.
Record observations in the laboratory information system (LIS).
D) Coombs Test (Direct Antiglobulin Test): 1. Add Coomb’s reagent to
a sample of patient’s washed RBCs and mix gently. 2. Centrifuge the
mixture and examine for agglutination. 3. Interpret the results and
record in LIS.
E) Additional Biochemical Testing: 1. Perform assays for lactate
dehydrogenase (LDH), indirect bilirubin, and haptoglobin using the
appropriate biochemical analyzers. 2. Record any elevated LDH,
elevated indirect bilirubin, and low haptoglobin as indicators of
hemolysis.
1. CALCULATION AND INTERPRETATION
1. Interpret CBC, reticulocyte count, and peripheral smear
findings in the context of hemolytic anemia.
2. Utilize Coombs test results to differentiate between
immune and non-immune hemolytic anemias.
3. Correlate biochemical markers (LDH, bilirubin,
haptoglobin) with the hematological findings.
4. Generate a summary combining all findings to provide a
comprehensive overview of the presence, degree, and
type of hemolysis.
2. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Run quality control materials for CBC, reticulocyte counts,
and biochemical assays at the beginning of each shift or
batch.
2. Document all QC results and ensure they fall within
acceptable ranges before proceeding with patient
samples.
3. Investigate and resolve any QC failures before continuing.
3. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Review and verify all results according to laboratory
protocols.
2. Summarize findings in a comprehensive report that
includes interpretations and recommendations for
physicians.
3. Document any critical values or findings and ensure
prompt notification to the attending physician or relevant
healthcare provider.
4. REFERENCES
• Laboratory instrument and reagent user manuals.
• Local and international guidelines on hemolytic anemia
management and diagnosis.
• Scientific literature and latest research on hemolytic anemia.
1. BACKUP AND CONTINGENCY PLAN
1. In the event of instrument failure, perform manual testing
procedures or refer to another certified laboratory.
2. Maintain a sufficient supply of reagents and QC materials
to avoid interruptions.
2. RECORD KEEPING
1. Maintain logs of all procedures performed, QC run, and
any corrective actions taken.
2. Store results in LIS and ensure regular backups.
