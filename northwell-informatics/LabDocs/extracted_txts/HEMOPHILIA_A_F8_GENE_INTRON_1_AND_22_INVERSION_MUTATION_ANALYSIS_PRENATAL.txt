Standard Operating Procedure: Hemophilia A F8 Gene, Intron 1
and Intron 22 Inversion Mutation Analysis (Prenatal)
1. PURPOSE
To provide a detailed procedure for the analysis of Hemophilia A F8
gene, specifically focusing on Intron 1 and Intron 22 inversion
mutations in prenatal specimens. This protocol ensures accurate,
reliable, and consistent results necessary for the diagnosis of
Hemophilia A in a prenatal setting.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
Clinical laboratory scientists and technologists are responsible for
performing and documenting each step of this procedure. The
laboratory supervisor is responsible for ensuring that all personnel
are trained on this SOP and that quality control measures are in
place.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type: Amniotic fluid or Chorionic Villus Sampling (CVS)
Volume: Minimum of 10 mL of amniotic fluid or 25 mg of CVS tissue.
Specimen Stability: Fresh samples are preferred. If transport or
processing is delayed, specimens should be stored at 2-8°C.
Unacceptable specimens include those that are not properly labeled,
insufficient in volume, or appear hemolyzed or contaminated.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• DNA extraction kit (commercially available, validated for use with
prenatal samples)
• PCR reagents:
◦ DNA polymerase
◦ dNTPs
◦ Primers specific to F8 intron 1 and intron 22 regions
◦ PCR buffer
• Gel electrophoresis equipment
• Capillary electrophoresis system or other approved sequencing
platform
• Positive and negative control samples
• Laboratory-grade water (nuclease-free)
• Thermal cycler
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
5. PROCEDURE
5.1 DNA Extraction
1. Process amniotic fluid or CVS tissue according to the DNA
extraction kit instructions.
2. Quantify the DNA using a spectrophotometer or fluorometer
and document the concentration and purity (A260/A280 ratio).
5.2 PCR Amplification
1. Prepare the PCR mix using the following components:
| Component | Volume (per reaction) |
|-----------------|-----------------------| | DNA template | 10-50 ng | |
PCR buffer | 1x | | dNTP mix | 200 μM each | | Forward primer |
10 μM | | Reverse primer | 10 μM | | DNA polymerase | 0.5 – 2
U | | Nuclease-free water | Up to 50 μL total reaction volume |
2. Amplify the DNA using the following thermal cycling conditions:
| Step | Temperature | Time |
|-----------------|-------------|---------------------| | Initial denaturation |
95°C | 5 minutes | | Denaturation | 95°C | 30 seconds | |
Annealing | 55-65°C* | 30 seconds | | Extension | 72°C | 1
minute per kb | | Final extension | 72°C | 10 minutes | | Hold |
4°C | Indefinitely |
*Optimum annealing temperature to be determined based on
primer Tm.
5.3 Gel Electrophoresis
1. Prepare an agarose gel (1-2%) containing an appropriate DNA
stain (e.g., ethidium bromide or SYBR Safe).
2. Load PCR products and run the electrophoresis at 100-150V
until bands are well separated.
3. Visualize bands under UV light and document results using gel
documentation system.
5.4 Capillary Electrophoresis/Sequencing
1. Purify PCR products using a commercial purification kit.
2. Load purified products onto capillary electrophoresis or
sequencing system as per the manufacturer's instructions.
3. Run sequencing reactions and analyze the data to identify
Intron 1 and Intron 22 inversion mutations.
4. Compare the results to control and reference sequences to
confirm mutation status.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
6.1 Controls
• Include positive and negative controls in each batch of PCR
amplification.
• Analyze control results before validating patient results.
• Repeat assay if controls do not perform as expected.
6.2 Documentation
• Record all steps, reagents, and observations in the laboratory
information system (LIS).
• Document control results in the QC log for verification.
7. RESULT REPORTING
• Results should be reviewed by a qualified molecular geneticist or
pathologist.
• Interpret results and report findings in the LIS.
• Provide detailed interpretations, including potential implications
for the patient and their family.
• Notify the referring clinician if urgent findings are discovered.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• False negatives may occur if mutations are present outside the
amplified regions.
• PCR inhibitors present in the sample may affect the results;
ensure DNA quality and purity.
• Prenatal samples may have lower DNA yield; ensure adequate
sample processing.
9. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's instruction manuals for DNA extraction and PCR
kits.
• Peer-reviewed literature on F8 gene inversion mutations.
