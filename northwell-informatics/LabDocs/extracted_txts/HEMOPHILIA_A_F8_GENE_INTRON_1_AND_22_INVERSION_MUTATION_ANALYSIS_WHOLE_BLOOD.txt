Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Hemophilia A F8 Gene,
Intron 1 and 22 Inversion Mutation Analysis, Whole Blood
1. PURPOSE
To provide a detailed and standardized protocol for the accurate and
reliable detection of Intron 1 and 22 inversion mutations in the F8
gene related to Hemophilia A using whole blood samples. This SOP
is designed to ensure consistency and quality in the analytical phase
of testing.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to the analytical phase for the testing of whole
blood specimens for F8 gene intron 1 and 22 inversion mutations,
and is to be followed by all laboratory personnel trained in molecular
genetics analysis.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the trained laboratory technologists to
perform the analysis as outlined in this SOP. Supervisors must
ensure staff competency and adherence to this protocol.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Sample Type: Whole blood
• Collection Tube: EDTA-anticoagulated tube (lavender top)
• Volume: Minimum 2 mL of blood is required
• Storage & Stability: Store the whole blood samples at 2-8°C if
analysis is to be performed within 72 hours. For long-term
storage, freeze at -20°C or below.
5. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• DNA extraction kits (e.g., QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit)
• PCR reagents (Taq polymerase, dNTPs, primers specific for
intron 1 and 22 inversions)
• Agarose and electrophoresis buffer (TAE or TBE)
• DNA ladder (e.g., 100 bp or 1 kb ladder)
• Molecular grade water
• Ethidium bromide or alternative DNA stain
• Gel documentation system
• Thermal cycler (PCR machine)
• Micropipettes and sterile tips
• Centrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Microcentrifuge tubes
6. PROCEDURE
A. DNA Extraction
1. Preparation: Equilibrate the blood sample to room
temperature. Label microcentrifuge tubes appropriately.
2. Extraction:
◦ Follow the manufacturer's instructions provided in the DNA
extraction kit.
◦ Elute the DNA in a final volume of 100 µL of elution buffer.
◦ Quantify the DNA using a spectrophotometer (e.g.,
Nanodrop) and store extracted DNA at -20°C until further
use.
B. PCR Amplification
1. Reaction Setup:
◦ Prepare a PCR master mix as follows for each sample:
▪ 10x PCR buffer: 5 µL
▪ MgCl2 (25 mM): 3 µL
▪ dNTP mix (10 mM each): 1 µL
▪ Forward primer (10 µM): 1 µL
▪ Reverse primer (10 µM): 1 µL
▪ Taq DNA polymerase (5U/µL): 0.25 µL (1.25 U)
▪ DNA template: 50-100 ng
▪ Molecular grade water to a final volume of 50 µL
2. Cycling Conditions:
◦ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 5 minutes
◦ Denaturation: 95°C for 30 seconds
◦ Annealing: 55°C for 30 seconds
◦ Extension: 72°C for 1 minute
◦ Number of cycles: 35
◦ Final extension: 72°C for 10 minutes
3. Run a positive control (known positive for the inversion)
and a negative control with molecular grade water.
C. Agarose Gel Electrophoresis
1. Gel Preparation:
◦ Prepare a 2% agarose gel in 1x TAE or TBE buffer. Include
an appropriate DNA stain in the gel.
◦ Allow the gel to solidify in the electrophoresis chamber.
2. Loading and Running:
◦ Mix 5 µL of PCR product with 1 µL of loading dye and load
into the wells.
◦ Include a DNA ladder for size comparison.
◦ Run the gel at 100 volts for approximately 45 minutes or
until the dye front reaches the end of the gel.
3. Visualization:
◦ Visualize bands under UV light using a gel documentation
system.
◦ Capture and save an image for analysis.
7. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
• Compare the band patterns of the samples to the positive control
and the DNA ladder.
• Presence of specific bands correlating to the size of the F8 gene
intron 1 and 22 inversions indicates a positive result.
• Absence of these bands in the presence of a band in the negative
control confirms a negative result.
• Document the results and any anomalies.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Internal Quality Control:
◦ Include a positive control and a negative control in each
batch of tests.
◦ Ensure the controls yield the expected results.
2. Documentation:
◦ Record all DNA concentrations, PCR setup details, and
electrophoresis images in the laboratory log.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS) for
review and verification by a qualified technologist.
• Generate a patient report including findings and comments on any
quality control issues.
10. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If no amplification: Check the DNA quality and concentration,
ensure all reagents are within stability, confirm PCR mix setup.
• If multiple non-specific bands: Optimize annealing
temperatures or redesign primers.
• If unexpected results: Repeat the analysis with fresh reagents
and another aliquot of DNA.
