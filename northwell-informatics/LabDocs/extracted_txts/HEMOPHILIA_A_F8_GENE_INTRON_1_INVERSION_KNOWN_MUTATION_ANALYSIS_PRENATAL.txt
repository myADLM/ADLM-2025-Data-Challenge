SOP for HEMOPHILIA A F8 GENE, INTRON 1 INVERSION KNOWN
MUTATION ANALYSIS, PRENATAL
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedure for the prenatal
analysis of the intron 1 inversion mutation in the F8 gene, associated
with Hemophilia A. This protocol ensures accurate and reliable
results.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory staff will perform the analysis
following this SOP. All results must be reviewed and verified by a
qualified laboratory supervisor prior to reporting.
1. SPECIMEN
Acceptable Specimens:
• Chorionic Villus Sampling (CVS): Preferred, 10 mg of chorionic
villi tissue, properly collected and transported to the laboratory.
• Amniotic Fluid (AF): 20 mL of amniotic fluid collected during
amniocentesis.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens that are improperly labeled or without proper
requisition.
• Samples that are contaminated, insufficient in quantity, or not
transported appropriately.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• DNA Extraction Kit
• PCR Thermocycler
• F8 Intron 1 inversion-specific primers
• PCR reagents including Taq polymerase, dNTPs, MgCl2, and
buffer
• Agarose Gel Electrophoresis apparatus and reagents
• DNA Ladder
• Ethidium Bromide or other safe DNA stain
• UV Transilluminator
• Qubit Fluorometer or other DNA quantification method
1. PROCEDURE
A) DNA Extraction:
1. Obtain chorionic villi or amniotic fluid sample as per standard
prenatal collection procedures.
2. Use the DNA Extraction Kit to isolate genomic DNA from the
sample according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
3. Quantify the extracted DNA using a Qubit Fluorometer or an
equivalent method to ensure there is a sufficient amount for
PCR analysis.
B) PCR Amplification:
1. Set up the PCR reaction with the following components:
◦ 10X PCR Buffer
◦ 25 mM MgCl2
◦ 10 mM dNTPs
◦ F8 Intron 1 inversion-specific primers (Forward and
Reverse)
◦ Taq DNA polymerase
◦ Genomic DNA template (from extraction step)
◦ Nuclease-free water to bring the total volume to 25-50 µL
2. PCR cycling conditions:
◦ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 5 minutes
◦ 35 cycles of:
▪ Denaturation: 95°C for 30 seconds
▪ Annealing: Temperature specific to primer Tm, generally
55-60°C for 30 seconds
▪ Extension: 72°C for 1 minute
◦ Final extension: 72°C for 10 minutes
C) Gel Electrophoresis:
1. Prepare a 2% agarose gel with ethidium bromide or other safe
DNA stain.
2. Load PCR products along with a DNA ladder into the wells of
the gel.
3. Run the gel electrophoresis at 100V for approximately 1 hour or
until the bands are well-separated.
4. Visualize the DNA bands under UV light using a UV
Transilluminator.
5. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
6. Compare the PCR product bands with the DNA ladder to
determine the size of the amplified fragments.
7. The presence of a specific sized band, as expected for the F8
intron 1 inversion mutation, indicates a positive result.
8. Absence of the band or presence of a different sized band
suggests a negative result or potential presence of a different
mutation, if observed.
9. QUALITY CONTROL
10. Include positive and negative controls in each PCR run to
ensure the reliability of the results.
11. Run internal quality controls regularly to ensure all reagents
and equipment are functioning properly.
12. Any discrepancies or issues encountered during testing must
be documented and investigated.
13. REPORTING RESULTS
14. Results should be documented accurately, and any anomalies
should be reviewed by the laboratory supervisor.
15. Provide a comprehensive report indicating whether the F8
intron 1 inversion associated with Hemophilia A is present or
absent.
16. Report should include patient identifiers, sample type, test
performed, results, and interpretation.
17. Critical results should be communicated immediately to the
referring clinician following standard laboratory procedures.
