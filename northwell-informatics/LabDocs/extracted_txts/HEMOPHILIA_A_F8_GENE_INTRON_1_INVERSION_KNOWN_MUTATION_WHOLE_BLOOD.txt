1. PURPOSE
To describe the procedure for the analytical phase of generating
results for Hemophilia A F8 gene, intron 1 inversion known mutation
analysis using whole blood specimens.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to the Molecular Genetics Laboratory
responsible for performing intron 1 inversion testing on the F8 gene
for diagnosing Hemophilia A in patient specimens.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
Qualified laboratory personnel are responsible for the receipt,
processing, analysis, and reporting of results according to this
Standard Operating Procedure (SOP). Laboratory personnel must
ensure that results are accurate and reliable before verification and
reporting.
4. MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT
• DNA extraction kit (validated for blood specimens)
• PCR reagents
• Specific primers for F8 intron 1 inversion
• Thermocycler
• Agarose gel electrophoresis apparatus
• Gel documentation system
• Sequencing reagents if necessary
• Positive and negative controls
• Molecular grade water
5. PROCEDURE
5.1 Specimen Requirements and Stability
• Acceptable specimen: whole blood collected in EDTA
anticoagulant.
• Optimal volume: at least 3 mL of whole blood.
• Whole blood specimens should be kept at 2-8°C and processed
within 5 days of collection.
5.2 DNA Extraction
1. Extract genomic DNA from whole blood using the DNA
extraction kit according to the manufacturer's protocol.
2. Quantify and assess the purity of the extracted DNA using a
spectrophotometer.
3. Store the DNA at -20°C until further analysis.
5.3 PCR Amplification
1. Prepare the PCR master mix according to the kit instructions
with specific primers for the F8 intron 1 inversion.
2. Add the extracted DNA to the master mix.
3. Set up the thermocycler program as follows:
◦ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 5 minutes
◦ 35 amplification cycles of:
▪ Denaturation: 95°C for 30 seconds
▪ Annealing: 58°C for 45 seconds
▪ Extension: 72°C for 1 minute
◦ Final extension: 72°C for 10 minutes
5.4 Gel Electrophoresis
1. Prepare a 2% agarose gel with an appropriate DNA staining
dye.
2. Load the PCR products and molecular weight marker into the
wells of the gel.
3. Run the electrophoresis at 100 volts for approximately 30-45
minutes.
4. Visualize and document the gel using a gel documentation
system.
5.5 Analysis and Interpretation
1. Compare the band pattern of the patient's sample against the
positive and negative controls.
2. A band corresponding to the F8 intron 1 inversion mutation
indicates a positive result, while the absence of the
corresponding band indicates a negative result.
3. If sequencing confirmation is required, perform Sanger
sequencing on the PCR products and analyze the sequences to
confirm the presence or absence of the inversion.
5.6 Quality Control
1. Include positive and negative controls in each run to validate
the assay results.
2. Repeat any run where controls fail to give expected results.
3. Document and review quality control results before reporting
patient results.
5.7 Reporting Results
1. Verify the results with a second qualified technologist before
reporting.
2. Report the results in the laboratory information system (LIS) as
per site-specific guidelines.
3. Include interpretation and, if applicable, implications of the
result in the report.
4. Critical values and significant findings should be promptly
reported to the ordering physician.
6. REFERENCE INTERVAL
• Positive result: Presence of F8 intron 1 inversion.
• Negative result: Absence of F8 intron 1 inversion.
7. METHOD LIMITATIONS
The sensitivity and specificity of the PCR-based approach depend on
the quality and integrity of the DNA sample. Poor DNA quality or low
quantity may affect the accuracy of the results.
