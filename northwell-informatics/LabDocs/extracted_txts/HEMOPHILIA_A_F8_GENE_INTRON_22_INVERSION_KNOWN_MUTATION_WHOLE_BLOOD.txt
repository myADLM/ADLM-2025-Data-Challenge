Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) for F8 Gene Intron 22
Inversion Testing in Hemophilia A
1. PURPOSE
To define the SOP for generating results for the Hemophilia A F8
gene intron 22 inversion known mutation using whole blood
specimens. This will involve all processes from specimen preparation
through to result analysis and reporting.
Responsibility:
Designated staff are responsible for performing the steps described
in this procedure accurately and documenting all relevant
information. It is the responsibility of the supervisor to ensure that all
steps are performed correctly, results are interpreted accurately, and
any anomalies are addressed immediately.
1. DEFINITION
F8 gene intron 22 inversion is a common mutation associated with
Hemophilia A, an X-linked recessive bleeding disorder. Whole blood
is collected from patients for genetic analysis to detect this mutation.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
• Specimen Type: Whole blood
• Collection Container: EDTA anticoagulant tube (lavender top)
• Volume Required: 3-5 mL of whole blood
• Stability: Specimens must be processed or stored within 24
hours of collection. Store at 2-8°C if processing is delayed.
• Unacceptable Specimens: Specimens that are clotted,
hemolyzed, collected in the wrong anticoagulant, or not properly
labeled will be rejected.
1. PROCEDURE
A) Specimen Processing:
1. Receipt and Verification:
◦ Verify patient identification and specimen information
against the test requisition.
◦ Document receipt of specimen and visually inspect for
integrity.
2. DNA Extraction:
◦ Perform DNA extraction using a commercially available kit
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Quantify the extracted DNA using a spectrophotometer and
ensure the DNA concentration is within the optimal range
(e.g., 50-100 ng/μL).
◦ Store extracted DNA at -20°C or proceed to amplification.
B) Amplification by PCR:
1. PCR Setup:
◦ Prepare master mix including, primers specific to the F8
gene intron 22 inversion, dNTPs, Taq DNA polymerase,
MgCl2, and buffer, following the manufacturer’s protocol.
◦ Add extracted DNA samples to individual PCR tubes
containing the master mix.
◦ Include positive and negative controls in each batch.
2. Cycling Conditions:
◦ Initial denaturation at 95°C for 5 minutes.
◦ Denaturation at 95°C for 1 minute, Annealing at 58°C for 1
minute, Extension at 72°C for 1 minute (30 cycles).
◦ Final extension at 72°C for 10 minutes.
C) Gel Electrophoresis:
1. Preparation:
◦ Prepare a 2% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide.
◦ Load PCR products and DNA ladder into wells.
2. Electrophoresis:
◦ Run the gel at 100 volts for approximately 1-hour, or until
the dye front has migrated an appropriate distance.
3. Visualization:
◦ Visualize bands under UV light and photograph the gel.
◦ Compare sample bands to the positive control for the
presence/absence of the inversion mutation.
D) Interpretation and Reporting:
1. Result Analysis:
◦ Compare band patterns of patient samples against the
control standards.
◦ Document positive, negative, or indeterminate results.
2. Quality Control:
◦ Ensure that controls are performing correctly (positive
control showing expected band, negative control showing no
band).
◦ Repeat any tests where controls fail.
3. Documentation and Reporting:
◦ Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
◦ Review and verify results by a competent technologist and
sign off by the supervisor.
◦ Report should include patient details, mutation status, and
any pertinent notes or comments regarding test limitations.
5. QUALITY CONTROL:
• Use DNA from a known positive and negative sample to ensure
assay accuracy.
• Monitor reagent expiration dates and storage conditions.
• Participate in external proficiency testing as available.
6. REFERENCES:
• Protocol for PCR and Gel Electrophoresis, manufacturer’s kit
instructions.
• Relevant literature and peer-reviewed articles on F8 gene intron
22 inversion and Hemophilia A.
7. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS:
• Follow universal precautions for handling blood specimens.
• Dispose of waste materials according to biohazard protocol.
• Use appropriate PPE (gloves, lab coat, eye protection) throughout
the procedure.
By adhering to this SOP, laboratory personnel can ensure accurate,
reliable, and timely results that facilitate the proper diagnosis and
management of Hemophilia A.
