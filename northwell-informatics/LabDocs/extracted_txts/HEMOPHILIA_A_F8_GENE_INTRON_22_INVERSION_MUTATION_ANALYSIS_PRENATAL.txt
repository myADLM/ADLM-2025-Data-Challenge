Protocol for Hemophilia A F8 Gene, Intron 22 Inversion Mutation
Analysis, Prenatal
1. PURPOSE
To outline the standard operating procedures for the analytical phase
of Hemophilia A F8 Gene, Intron 22 Inversion Mutation Analysis for
prenatal samples.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory staff are responsible for
performing the analysis following the outlined procedures.
Supervisors ensure that the procedures are correctly followed and
documented.
1. DEFINITION
Hemophilia A is a genetic disorder caused by mutations in the F8
gene, which encodes for coagulation factor VIII. One common
mutation associated with severe hemophilia A is the intron 22
inversion.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred sample: Amniotic fluid or chorionic villus sampling
(CVS) collected according to standard obstetric procedures.
• Acceptable volume: Minimum of 2 mL for amniotic fluid or 5-10
mg for CVS.
• Ensure samples are correctly labeled with patient information,
collection date, and time.
1. EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS
• PCR machine
• Electrophoresis apparatus
• Microcentrifuge
• Pipettes and tips
• DNA extraction kits
• Primers specific for intron 22 inversion
• Agarose gel
• Ethidium bromide or another appropriate DNA stain
• Gel documentation system
1. PROCEDURE
A) DNA Extraction
1. Extract genomic DNA from the prenatal sample using a
validated DNA extraction kit.
2. Quantify and assess quality of extracted DNA using
spectrophotometry or fluorometry.
3. Store extracted DNA at -20°C until further processing.
B) PCR Amplification
1. Prepare PCR reaction mixture according to manufacturer’s
instructions, including primers specific for intron 22 inversion.
2. Amplify DNA following optimized thermal cycling conditions: a.
Initial denaturation: 95°C for 3 minutes b. Denaturation: 95°C
for 30 seconds c. Annealing: 55-60°C for 30 seconds (adjust as
needed) d. Extension: 72°C for 1 minute e. Final extension:
72°C for 5 minutes f. Number of cycles: 35-40
C) Gel Electrophoresis
1. Prepare a 2% agarose gel with an appropriate DNA stain.
2. Load PCR products onto the gel along with a DNA marker.
3. Run at 100-120V for 45-60 minutes.
4. Visualize bands under UV light and document results.
D) Interpretation and Reporting
1. Compare sample band pattern to control and marker lanes.
2. Confirm the presence or absence of intron 22 inversion based
on band size and pattern.
3. Document findings and review for accuracy.
4. Report results following laboratory protocols, including detailed
notes on sample integrity and any issues encountered during
analysis.
E) Quality Control
1. Include positive and negative controls in every run to ensure
the accuracy of the results.
2. Re-analyze results if controls do not perform as expected.
3. Document all quality control checks and actions taken.
4. LIMITATIONS
Interpretation of results may be influenced by sample quality, DNA
integrity, and PCR efficiency. Any limitations encountered should be
documented and reported.
1. REFERENCES
