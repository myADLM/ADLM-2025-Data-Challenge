SOP Title: Analytical Phase for Hemophilia A, F8 Gene, Next-
Generation Sequencing
1. Purpose: To outline procedures for the analytical phase in
generating diagnostic results for Hemophilia A using next-
generation sequencing (NGS) of the F8 gene.
Responsibility: Laboratory personnel trained in NGS technology are
responsible for following this protocol and ensuring test accuracy,
precision, and efficient result generation.
1. Scope: This procedure covers all steps from DNA extraction to
data analysis and result reporting for samples submitted for
Hemophilia A, F8 gene sequencing using NGS.
2. Definitions:
• NGS: Next-generation sequencing, a method used to sequence
DNA rapidly and affordably.
• F8 gene: The gene responsible for encoding coagulation factor
VIII, mutations in which are linked to Hemophilia A.
• QC: Quality control, steps taken to ensure the accuracy and
precision of laboratory tests.
1. Procedure:
A. Sample Preparation:
1. Ensure the integrity and identity of samples are maintained
from the time of receipt to result reporting.
2. Record patient identifiers linked to unique laboratory accession
numbers in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
B. DNA Extraction:
1. Extract genomic DNA from patient samples using a validated
extraction kit/method.
2. Measure the DNA concentration and assess purity using a
spectrophotometer (e.g., NanoDrop).
3. Store extracted DNA at -20°C until ready for library preparation.
C. Library Preparation:
1. Generate an NGS library from the extracted DNA using a
validated library preparation kit following the manufacturer's
protocols.
2. Perform targeted enrichment for the F8 gene using specific
capture probes or amplicons.
3. Assess the quality and quantity of the prepared library using a
bioanalyzer and fluorometer to ensure it meets input
requirements for sequencing.
D. Next-Generation Sequencing:
1. Load the prepared library onto the NGS sequencer as per the
manufacturer's instructions.
2. Ensure appropriate sequencing run parameters are set,
including read length and coverage depth.
3. Initiate sequencing and monitor the run to ensure there are no
technical issues.
E. Data Analysis:
1. Utilize bioinformatics pipelines, including FASTQ file
generation, alignment to the reference genome (GRCh38 or
latest), and variant calling.
2. Review the raw sequencing reads and assess data quality
metrics, including read depth, uniformity of coverage, and base
call accuracy.
3. Annotate identified variants using a comprehensive database to
interpret their clinical significance.
F. Quality Control:
1. Perform a quality check on all steps, including DNA extraction,
library preparation, and sequencing, ensuring QC metrics meet
acceptance criteria.
2. Include positive and negative controls in the sequencing run to
evaluate process reliability.
3. Document any deviations from protocol and corrective actions
taken.
G. Result Interpretation:
1. Correlate genetic findings with clinical data.
2. Determine the pathogenicity of identified variants, referencing
literature, databases (ClinVar, HGMD), and existing guidelines
(ACMG).
3. Prepare a comprehensive result report detailing detected
variants, their clinical implications, and any recommended
follow-up.
H. Reporting:
1. Verify results by a qualified molecular geneticist or designated
personnel.
2. Ensure all patient results are accurately entered into the LIS.
3. Communicate significant findings to the referring physician,
including any critical or actionable variants.
References:
• Specific NGS platform and kit inserts.
• ClinVar, HGMD, ACMG guidelines on variant classification.
1. Documentation: Record all findings, inclusive of QC results, in
the Laboratory Information System and retain raw data files as
required by laboratory regulatory standards.

This protocol should be reviewed and updated annually to
incorporate the latest best practices, technology, and guidelines
relevant to next-generation sequencing for Hemophilia A diagnosis.
