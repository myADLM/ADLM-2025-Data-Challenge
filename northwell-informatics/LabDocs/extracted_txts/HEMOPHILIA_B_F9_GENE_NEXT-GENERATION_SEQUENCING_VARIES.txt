Standard Operating Procedure
HEMOPHILIA B, F9 GENE, NEXT-GENERATION SEQUENCING
1. PURPOSE: To provide a detailed standard operating procedure
(SOP) for the analysis phase specifically for generating results
for Hemophilia B, F9 Gene using Next-Generation Sequencing
(NGS). This protocol ensures accurate identification of genetic
variations within the F9 gene that may contribute to Hemophilia
B.
2. RESPONSIBILITY: It is the responsibility of the laboratory
personnel to perform the procedure as specified and ensure
accurate and reliable results. Any deviation from the SOP
should be documented and approved by the laboratory
supervisor.
3. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS:
• NGS platform (e.g., Illumina MiSeq, Ion Torrent)
• Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer
• PCR Amplification System (Thermocycler)
• High-sensitivity DNA reagents
• Library preparation kit (e.g., Nextera XT DNA Library Prep Kit)
• Clean-room environment
• Calibrated pipettes and sterile tips
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
• Bioinformatics software (e.g., Illumina Basespace)
1. SPECIMEN PREPARATION: 4.1 Sample Type:
• Genomic DNA extracted from a peripheral blood sample or buccal
swab.
4.2 Initial Quality Control:
• Measure DNA concentration using Qubit or NanoDrop
spectrophotometer.
• Assess DNA integrity using Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. High-quality
DNA should show a sharp band with minimal degradation.
1. PROCEDURE: 5.1 Library Preparation:
2. Quantify extracted DNA using the Qubit fluorometer.
3. Normalize DNA concentration to the required input amount as
specified by the library kit manufacturer's instructions.
4. Perform DNA fragmentation as recommended (e.g., enzymatic
or mechanical shearing).
5. Construct NGS library using the Nextera XT DNA Library
Preparation Kit, following the manufacturer's protocol precisely.
6. Perform PCR amplification of the target regions (F9 gene) and
purify the amplified products using provided magnetic beads.
5.2 Quality Control of Library:
1. Analyze the prepared library using Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer to
ensure appropriate size distribution (typically 200-300 bp).
2. Quantify the library using Qubit or qPCR.
5.3 Sequencing:
1. Load the library onto the NGS platform following the
manufacturer's guidelines.
2. Ensure correct run setup, including correct reference genome
(e.g., hg38) and target region specifications.
3. Start the sequencing run and monitor quality metrics and
sequencing performance regularly.
5.4 Bioinformatics Analysis:
1. Perform initial data quality assessment using the NGS
platform’s base-calling software.
2. Perform read alignment to the human reference genome (hg38)
using appropriate bioinformatics software (e.g., BWA or
Bowtie2).
3. Identify genetic variants within the F9 gene using variant calling
software (e.g., GATK or Varscan) and annotate using
appropriate annotation tools (e.g., Annovar).
5.5 Variant Interpretation:
1. Filtering: Apply filters to exclude common polymorphisms and
artifacts.
2. Clinical Interpretation: Classify variants according to ACMG
guidelines.
3. Cross-reference significant variants with public databases (e.g.,
ClinVar, dbSNP).
4. Validate significant findings by Sanger sequencing if necessary.
5. REPORTING RESULTS:
6. Draft a detailed report including:
◦ Sample details
◦ Summary of methods and analysis
◦ Identified variants with interpretation
◦ Clinical significance
7. Review the report by a clinical geneticist.
8. Finalize and issue the report through the Lab Information
System (LIS).
9. Discuss critical findings with the patient’s attending physician, if
needed.
10. QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE:
11. Run positive and negative controls with each batch of samples.
12. Maintain instrument calibration records and perform routine
maintenance as per manufacturer guidelines.
13. Participate in proficiency testing (e.g., CAP, EMQN) to ensure
the accuracy of the testing process.

1. DOCUMENTATION:
2. Record all steps in the laboratory notebooks or electronic
systems.
3. Document any deviations from the SOP and corrective actions.
This protocol ensures that results generated for Hemophilia B, F9
Gene by Next-Generation Sequencing are accurate, reliable, and
clinically relevant. Proper adherence to this SOP will aid in the
effective diagnosis and management of Hemophilia B.
