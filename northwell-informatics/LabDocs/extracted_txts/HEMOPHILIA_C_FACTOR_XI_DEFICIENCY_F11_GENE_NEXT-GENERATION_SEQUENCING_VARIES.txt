5. PROCEDURE
5.1 DNA Extraction:
1. Extract genomic DNA from the received blood or tissue sample
using a validated DNA extraction kit.
2. Quantify the DNA concentration using a Qubit dsDNA assay or
equivalent method.
3. Assess DNA integrity using a Bioanalyzer or Fragment
Analyzer.
4. Record DNA quality and concentration in the laboratory
information system (LIS).
5.2 PCR Amplification of the F11 gene:
1. Design and validate primers specific to the exons and flanking
intronic regions of the F11 gene.
2. Prepare PCR reactions as per the manufacturer's protocol
included with the PCR kit.
3. Perform PCR amplification under optimized cycling conditions.
4. Verify the amplification success by running the PCR product on
an agarose gel.
5.3 Library Preparation:
1. Normalize the amplified DNA to a consistent concentration.
2. Prepare sequencing libraries using a validated DNA library
preparation kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
3. Perform size selection if necessary to ensure library quality.
4. Quantify the final library using a Qubit assay and assess library
size distribution using the Bioanalyzer or Fragment Analyzer.
5.4 Next-Generation Sequencing:
1. Pool libraries at equimolar concentrations.
2. Load libraries onto the NGS sequencer following the
manufacturer's guidelines.
3. Enter the experiment's run parameters into the sequencing
instrument.
4. Monitor the sequencing run to ensure proper function and
troubleshoot as necessary.
5.5 Data Analysis:
1. Perform base calling and initial quality control using the
sequencer's integrated software.
2. Use bioinformatics tools to align sequences to the reference
F11 gene sequence.
3. Identify potential variants using suitable variant calling software.
4. Annotate detected variants and cross-reference with known
databases.
5. Classify variants based on pathogenicity following ACMG
guidelines.
5.6 Interpretation and Reporting:
1. Review, interpret, and confirm identified variants by a qualified
professional (medical geneticist or pathologist).
2. Summarize findings in a report, including any detected variants
and their clinical relevance.
3. Submit the report to the LIS and verify for any transcription
errors.
4. Ensure findings are communicated securely to the requesting
physician or healthcare provider.
6. QUALITY CONTROL AND TROUBLESHOOTING
6.1 Quality Control:
1. Include positive and negative control samples in each
sequencing run.
2. Perform inter-run comparisons using reference samples to
ensure consistency.
3. Document all quality control findings in the laboratory quality
control log.
6.2 Troubleshooting:
1. If PCR amplification fails, verify primer integrity and reaction
conditions.
2. If library preparation fails, check reagent integrity and repeat
the library preparation.
3. If sequencing quality metrics fail, rerun the library on a different
sequencing instrument if available and verify run setup.
4. Review data for potential contamination or sample mix-ups if
unexpected results are obtained.
