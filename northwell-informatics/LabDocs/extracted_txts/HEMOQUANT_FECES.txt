STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE
TITLE: HEMOQUANT, FECES ANALYSIS
1. PURPOSE
To provide detailed instructions for the analytical phase of quantifying
fecal hemoglobin concentration using HEMOQUANT in a CLIA-
certified laboratory. This protocol ensures accurate and precise
results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for following this
procedure meticulously to ensure accurate results. All staff are to
identify and report any deviations or potential issues to the laboratory
supervisor.
3. DEFINITION
HEMOQUANT is a hemoglobin quantification assay used to measure
the amount of hemoglobin in fecal specimens.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred specimen: Freshly collected fecal sample.
• Collection: Specimen should be collected in a clean, dry, leak-
proof container and sent to the laboratory within 24 hours.
• Storage: If immediate analysis is not possible, store the specimen
at 2-6°C for up to 48 hours. For longer storage, freeze the
specimen at -20°C.
5. SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS
• Utilize appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) including
gloves, lab coat, and face protection.
• Handle all specimens and materials as if they are potentially
infectious.
• Follow biohazard waste disposal guidelines.
6. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• HEMOQUANT kit (contains necessary reagents and standards)
• Spectrophotometer or microplate reader
• Pipettes and tips
• Vortex mixer
• Centrifuge
• 96-well microtiter plate
• Deionized water
• Absorbent pads/mats
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Before beginning the test, ensure quality control (QC) materials
provided with the HEMOQUANT kit are processed.
• Include a positive control, a negative control, and an assay blank
in each assay run.
• Results should fall within the specified QC ranges. If QC fails,
troubleshoot the issue, re-run the controls, and document all
actions taken.
8. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation
1. Homogenize the fecal specimen thoroughly.
2. Weigh out approximately 1 gram of the fecal sample and
transfer it to a labeled microcentrifuge tube.
3. Add 10 mL of deionized water to the sample (10%
homogenate).
4. Vortex the sample for 2-3 minutes to ensure thorough mixing.
5. Centrifuge the sample at 3000 x g for 10 minutes.
6. Carefully transfer the supernatant to a new labeled
microcentrifuge tube for analysis.
B. HEMOQUANT Assay
1. Bring all reagents and samples to room temperature before
use.
2. Prepare the HEMOQUANT reagents according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
3. Pipette 50 µL of the standard solutions, controls, and sample
supernatants into the designated wells of the 96-well microtiter
plate.
4. Add 100 µL of the working reagent to each well.
5. Mix the plate gently by pipetting up and down or using a plate
shaker.
6. Incubate the plate at room temperature for 30 minutes,
protected from light.
7. Read the absorbance at 450 nm using a spectrophotometer or
microplate reader within 5 minutes of incubation completion.
9. RESULTS CALCULATION
• Measure the absorbance of each well.
• Generate a standard curve by plotting the absorbance of the
standards against their corresponding concentrations.
• Determine the concentration of hemoglobin in each sample by
extrapolating from the standard curve.
• Calculate the final fecal hemoglobin concentration by considering
the dilution factor.
10. REPORTING RESULTS
• Document the results in the lab information system (LIS).
• Evaluate the results based on established reference ranges.
• Notify the ordering physician of any critical values as per
laboratory policy.
• Reference range for fecal hemoglobin: <1.5 mg/g feces (values
may vary, confirm with site-specific guidelines).
11. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemoglobin degradation due to improper sample storage.
• Interference from certain substances such as iron supplements
and dietary factors.
• Consult the HEMOQUANT kit insert for additional limitations.

for HEMOQUANT, FECES analysis. Follow this SOP rigorously to
ensure the accuracy and reliability of test results.
