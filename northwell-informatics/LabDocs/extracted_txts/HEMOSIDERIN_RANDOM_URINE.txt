Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Generating Results for
Hemosiderin, Random, Urine
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the analysis and reporting of
hemosiderin in random urine samples. This ensures accuracy,
reliability, and consistency in test results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the laboratory technologists and designated
staff to follow this SOP when performing hemosiderin analysis, and to
report any deviations or issues encountered during the process to the
supervising personnel.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Centrifuge
• Microscope with appropriate magnification
• Glass slides and coverslips
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Staining solution (Prussian blue stain)
◦ Ferrocyanide Solution: 2% potassium ferrocyanide
◦ Acid Solution: 2% hydrochloric acid
• Fresh, sterile 15 ml conical tubes
• Gloves, lab coat, and other PPE (personal protective equipment)
4. SPECIMEN ACCEPTANCE AND REQUIREMENTS
Specimen: Random urine sample (preferably freshly collected)
• Unacceptable specimens include:
◦ Urine samples received more than 24 hours after collection
without proper refrigeration.
◦ Urine samples without proper patient identification.
5. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation:
1. Label all glass slides with the patient's identification number.
2. Transfer a fresh random urine specimen to a 15 ml conical
tube.
B) Centrifugation:
1. Centrifuge the urine sample at 2000 rpm for 5 minutes.
2. Carefully decant the supernatant, leaving the sediment at the
bottom of the tube.
C) Staining:
1. Resuspend the sediment in a small amount of remaining
supernatant.
2. Place one drop of the resuspended sediment onto a glass slide.
3. Add one drop of freshly prepared Ferrocyanide Solution and
one drop of Acid Solution to the slide.
4. Mix gently using a pipette tip or toothpick to ensure even
distribution.
5. Allow the mixture to stand for 5-10 minutes at room
temperature.
6. Place a coverslip over the stained mixture on the slide.
D) Microscopy:
1. Examine the slide under the microscope at 10x and 40x
magnification.
2. Identify the presence of hemosiderin granules, which will stain
blue.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Fresh positive control (known hemosiderin-positive urine) should
be stained concurrently with patient samples to ensure the
staining procedure’s accuracy.
• Include a negative control (fresh normal urine) to confirm the
specificity of the stain and to identify any potential contamination.
• Record all control results in the Quality Control logbook and verify
that they fall within acceptable limits before reporting patient
results.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
• Report the presence of hemosiderin as either:
◦ Negative
◦ Trace
◦ 1+ (Mild)
◦ 2+ (Moderate)
◦ 3+ (Marked)
• If a large amount of hemosiderin is seen, consider documenting
as "3+" with a recommendation for further clinical correlation.
• Document results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS) and
ensure the report is verified by a qualified technologist.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemosiderin detection may be limited by the collection time and
state of the urine sample. Ensure samples are processed
promptly.
• False positives/negatives: Proper staining and sample handling
are crucial to avoid misinterpretation.
• Interference by other granular casts or urinary sediments may
require an experienced technician’s assessment.
9. REFERENCES
Refer to the package inserts of the staining reagents for specific
handling instructions and additional method limitations.
10. DOCUMENTATION
Ensure all data, including control tests, are logged and maintained as
per the lab’s standard documentation practices. Issues, anomalies, or
deviations encountered during the process should be reported to the
supervisor immediately.
By following this protocol, laboratory staff can ensure accurate and
reliable reporting of hemosiderin presence in random urine samples.
