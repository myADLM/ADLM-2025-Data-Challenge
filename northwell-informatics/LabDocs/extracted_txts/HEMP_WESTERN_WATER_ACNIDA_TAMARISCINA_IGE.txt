SOP for Analytical Phase: HEMP WESTERN WATER (ACNIDA
TAMARISCINA) IGE Testing
1. PURPOSE
To establish a standardized procedure for the analysis and reporting
of Hemp Western Water (Acnida tamariscina) IgE levels in patient
serum samples.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel involved in the
analytical and reporting phases of Hemp Western Water (Acnida
tamariscina) IgE testing in a CLIA-certified laboratory setting.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the laboratory staff to ensure that:
• All steps in this procedure are followed accurately.
• Appropriate quality control measures are in place and adhered to.
• Any deviations from the standard procedure are documented and
reported to the laboratory supervisor.
4. DEFINITION
Hemp Western Water (Acnida tamariscina) IgE Test: An
immunoassay used to detect serum IgE antibodies specific for the
allergen Hemp Western Water.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Serum separator tubes (SST)
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes and tips
• Microplate reader with appropriate software
• IgE specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit for
Hemp Western Water (Acnida tamariscina)
◦ Assay buffer
◦ Wash buffer
◦ Substrate solution
◦ Stop solution
◦ Enzyme conjugate
◦ Standard dilutions
◦ Well strips coated with specific allergen
• Quality control (QC) materials
• Laboratory timer
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
6. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
• Preferred specimen: Serum
• Collection: Serum separator tube (SST), filled to the indicator line.
• Stability: Serum samples can be stored at 2-8°C for up to 48
hours. For long-term storage, samples must be frozen at -20°C or
colder.
7. PROCEDURE
Sample Preparation
1. Allow the SST to clot for 30 minutes at room temperature.
2. Centrifuge the SST at 1500 g for 10 minutes.
3. Carefully transfer the supernatant (serum) to a labelled
microtube.
4. Store the serum sample at 2-8°C if it will be tested within 48
hours or freeze at -20°C for longer storage.
Assay Procedure
1. Reagents Preparation:
◦ Bring reagents to room temperature before use.
◦ Prepare wash buffer, enzyme conjugate, substrate solution,
and stop solution according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
2. Standard and QC Material Preparation:
◦ Prepare serial dilutions of standards as indicated in the
ELISA kit insert.
◦ Prepare QC samples as per laboratory quality control policy.
3. Plate Preparation:
◦ Place the required number of allergen-coated well strips into
the strip holder.
◦ Add 100 µL of diluted standards, QC materials, and patient
samples to the appropriate wells.
4. Incubation:
◦ Incubate the plate at room temperature for the time
specified in the ELISA kit insert (typically 60 minutes).
5. Washing:
◦ Wash the wells 5 times with wash buffer using an automated
plate washer or manually with a multi-channel pipette.
◦ After the final wash, gently tap the plate on absorbent paper
to remove excess liquid.
6. Addition of Enzyme Conjugate:
◦ Add 100 µL of enzyme conjugate to each well.
◦ Incubate the plate at room temperature for the time
specified in the ELISA kit insert (usually 30 minutes).
7. Second Washing Step:
◦ Wash the wells 5 times with wash buffer.
8. Substrate Reaction:
◦ Add 100 µL of substrate solution to each well.
◦ Incubate the plate in the dark at room temperature for the
time specified in the ELISA kit insert (usually 10-20
minutes).
9. Stopping the Reaction:
◦ Add 100 µL of stop solution to each well.
◦ Gently tap the plate to mix the contents.
10. Reading the Results:
◦ Read the plate at the specified wavelength using a
microplate reader (usually 450 nm).
◦ Record the optical density (OD) values.
11. Data Analysis:
◦ Plot the standard curve and determine the concentration of
IgE in patient samples using the microplate reader software.
◦ Compare patient results with reference intervals provided in
the ELISA kit for interpretation.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run positive and negative QC samples with each assay run and
ensure results fall within established control ranges.
• Document all QC results. If QC results are out of range,
troubleshoot and repeat the assay.
• Maintain QC records for review and inspection.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results are reviewed and verified by the technologist before being
entered into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Critical values should be communicated immediately to the
requesting clinician following the laboratory's critical results policy.
