Standard Operating Procedure for Heparin-PF4 IgG Antibody,
Serum Testing
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for the analysis of Heparin-PF4 IgG
Antibody in serum specimens to ensure accurate and reliable results
for the detection of Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT).
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing the
test according to this SOP and documenting findings accordingly.
Supervisors are responsible for ensuring compliance with the
procedure and troubleshooting any issues that arise.
1. DEFINITIONS
• Heparin-PF4 IgG Antibody: An antibody produced in response to
complex formation between heparin and platelet factor 4 (PF4),
commonly associated with HIT.
• HIT: Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia, a serious immune-
mediated adverse reaction to heparin.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
• Preferred Specimen: Serum from a SST (Serum Separator
Tube).
• Volume: A minimum of 1 mL of serum is required.
• Storage:
◦ Specimens can be stored at 2-8°C for up to 48 hours if testing
is delayed.
◦ For longer storage, freeze at -20°C or below.
• Unacceptable Specimens:
◦ Hemolyzed samples.
◦ Lipemic or icteric specimens.
◦ Samples not centrifuged to remove cells.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Equipment:
◦ Centrifuge
◦ ELISA plate reader
◦ Micropipettes and tips
◦ Incubator
• Reagents and Supplies:
◦ Heparin-PF4 IgG ELISA kit (includes controls and calibrators)
◦ Distilled water
◦ Absorbent paper
◦ Test tubes and racks
◦ Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation:
• Ensure all reagents and equipment are ready and at the required
temperatures.
• Wear PPE as per laboratory safety guidelines.
• Verify and record the calibration status of equipment used.
B. Specimen Handling:
• Once received, centrifuge SST tubes at 1500 x g for 10 minutes to
separate serum.
• Aliquot the serum into a labeled test tube if not immediately
analyzing.
• Ensure serum is free of cellular components before proceeding.
C. Test Procedure:
1. ELISA Setup:
◦ Allow all reagents to reach room temperature before use.
◦ Follow the specific instructions provided in the Heparin-PF4
IgG ELISA kit insert.
◦ Prepare calibrators, controls, and patient samples in
duplicate as per kit instructions.
2. Sample Addition:
◦ Add 100 μL of the calibrators, controls, and patient samples
to the appropriate wells.
◦ Incubate the plate at 37°C for the time specified by the kit
manufacturer.
3. Washing:
◦ Wash the plate as instructed in the kit insert to remove
unbound antibodies.
4. Substrate Addition:
◦ Add 100 μL of enzyme-linked conjugate to each well and
incubate as per kit instructions.
5. Detection:
◦ Add the enzyme substrate to each well and incubate in the
dark.
6. Stop Reaction:
◦ Add the stop solution once the color develops.
◦ Read the optical absorbance of each well at 450 nm within
30 minutes of stopping the reaction.
D. Quality Control:
• Include both positive and negative controls with each run to
validate the test.
• Document all control results. Controls must be within the
established ranges for the assay to be valid.
• If controls are out of range, do not report patient results.
Investigate and resolve the issue, then repeat the assay.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Calculate results based on the absorbance readings according to
the ELISA kit manufacturer's instructions.
• Report patient results as positive or negative for Heparin-PF4 IgG
Antibodies following the interpretative criteria specified in the kit
insert.
• Ensure all results are verified by a qualified technologist before
releasing them.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Negative: No significant level of Heparin-PF4 IgG Antibodies
detected.
• Positive: Level of Heparin-PF4 IgG Antibodies in serum indicative
of possible HIT.
1. RESULTS DOCUMENTATION AND REPORTING
• Document results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Critical results must be reviewed, verified, and reported according
to the laboratory policy.
• Notify appropriate healthcare personnel of positive results as HIT
is a critical condition requiring immediate attention.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If technical issues arise during the procedure (e.g., equipment
malfunction), follow the manufacturer's troubleshooting guide and
laboratory protocol.
• In case of unexpected results or control failures, revalidate the
assay, review all processes, and consult with the supervisor if
necessary.
