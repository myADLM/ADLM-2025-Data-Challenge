Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Determination of Heparin Anti-Xa Activity in Plasma
1. PURPOSE
To provide the protocol for the determination of Heparin Anti-Xa
activity in plasma samples. This procedure ensures consistent,
accurate results and maintains quality control within the laboratory.
Responsibility: All trained personnel are responsible for adhering to
this SOP to ensure the accurate determination of Heparin Anti-Xa
activity. Supervisors are responsible for validating results and
maintaining appropriate documentation.
1. DEFINITIONS
Heparin Anti-Xa: A laboratory test used to monitor the anticoagulation
effect of heparin therapy by measuring the inhibition of Factor Xa.
Plasma: The liquid component of blood, collected in specific tubes,
which is used for various blood tests.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/acceptable:
• Collect plasma using sodium citrate tubes (light blue top).
• Specimens must be centrifuged within 30 minutes of collection to
separate plasma.
• Plasma should be frozen at -20°C if not analyzed within 4 hours of
collection.
Unacceptable:
• Hemolyzed specimens.
• Specimens not centrifuged within the specified time frame.
• Samples collected in tubes other than sodium citrate.
• Specimens arriving in the laboratory more than 2 hours after
collection without proper refrigeration during transit.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Automated Heparin Anti-Xa analyzer (e.g., Sysmex CA-1500)
• Heparin Anti-Xa kit (e.g., Rotachrome® Anti-Xa)
• Calibrators and controls (Low, Medium, High Anti-Xa activity)
• Sodium citrate tubes
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes and tips
• Gloves and appropriate PPE (personal protective equipment)
• Laboratory timer
1. PROCEDURE
A. Pre-Analytical Phase:
• Verify that the collected sodium citrate tubes are correctly labelled
with patient information and collection time.
• Centrifuge the samples at 2000-2500 g for 10-15 minutes at 4°C
to separate plasma.
• Transfer plasma to properly labeled secondary tubes using
pipettes, avoiding any cellular debris.
B. Analytical Phase:
1. Preparation:
• Bring all reagents and plasma samples to room temperature.
• Set up the automated analyzer according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
• Calibrate the analyzer using calibrators provided with the kit.
1. Testing:
• Load plasma samples into the analyzer as per the manufacturer’s
guidelines.
• Ensure that quality controls are run along with patient samples.
• Start the testing process by initiating the analyzer's protocols for
Anti-Xa activity detection.
1. Reviewing Results:
• Validate the obtained results by checking against quality control
results.
• If results are outside the expected range for controls, troubleshoot
equipment or reagents as necessary.
• Document any corrective actions taken.
C. Post-Analytical Phase:
• Record all results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Review results for any flagged values or critical results.
• Notify the ordering physician of any critical values according to lab
policy.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
A. Daily QC:
• Perform quality control tests using control material (Low, Medium,
High) at the beginning of each day.
• Document all control results along with their respective lot
numbers and expiry dates.
• Repeat tests for any out-of-range control results and investigate
potential causes.
B. Maintenance:
• Perform routine maintenance on the automated analyzer
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
• Ensure all reagents are within their expiry date and stored under
appropriate conditions.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
A. Normal Reference Values: Consult assay manufacturer’s
reference guide.
• Anti-Xa therapeutic range: 0.3 – 0.7 IU/mL
B. Critical Results:
• Anti-Xa activity <0.1 IU/mL or >1.0 IU/mL should be promptly
communicated to the ordering physician following laboratory
policy.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the Heparin Anti-Xa kit insert for limitations specific to the
reagents and assay used.
• Hemolyzed samples can lead to inaccurate results.
• Improperly stored samples can degrade and provide erroneous
results.
