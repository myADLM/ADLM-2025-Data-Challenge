Protocol for HEPARIN COFACTOR II (HCII) Analysis
1. PURPOSE: To establish standardized procedures for the
accurate and precise analysis of Heparin Cofactor II (HCII)
levels in plasma samples using the chromogenic substrate
assay method.
2. RESPONSIBILITY: Designated laboratory personnel are
responsible for following this procedure to ensure the validity of
the HCII test results.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS:
• Specimen Type: Human plasma
• Collection Tube: 3.2% sodium citrate (light blue-top tube)
• Volume: Minimum of 2 mL plasma
• Processing: Centrifuge within 30 minutes of collection at 1500 x g
for 15 minutes at room temperature to obtain platelet-poor plasma
(PPP)
• Storage: Store plasma in aliquots at -70°C if not assaying within 8
hours. Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
• Unacceptable Specimens: Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES:
• Chromogenic substrate assay kit for HCII
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Microcentrifuge tubes
• Spectrophotometer or plate reader capable of measuring
absorbance at 405 nm
• Microcentrifuge
• Calibration standards
• Quality control materials (Normal and Abnormal controls)
• Incubator set to 37°C
• Laboratory glassware and PPE (Personal Protective Equipment)
1. PROCEDURE: A) Calibration and Quality Control:
2. Prepare calibration standards and quality control samples as
indicated in the assay kit insert.
3. Calibrate the spectrophotometer or plate reader as per the
manufacturer's instructions.
4. Include controls in every assay run to ensure method accuracy
and precision.
B) Assay Procedure:
1. Thaw plasma samples at 37°C if frozen, mix gently, and avoid
bubbles.
2. Mix reagents and prepare working solutions according to the
assay kit insert.
3. Label microcentrifuge tubes or wells for samples, standards,
and controls.
4. Prepare reaction mixture by adding chromogenic substrate,
buffer, and sample/standard/control in the specified order as per
assay kit instructions.
5. Incubate the reaction mixture at 37°C for the specific time noted
in the assay kit (usually 10 minutes).
6. Stop the reaction by adding the stop solution provided in the kit.
7. Measure the absorbance at 405 nm in a spectrophotometer or
plate reader.
C) Calculation of Results:
1. Use calibration standards to generate a standard curve.
2. Calculate the concentration of HCII in each sample using the
standard curve.
3. Verify that control results are within acceptable ranges before
reporting patient results.
4. REPORTING RESULTS:
• Report HCII concentration in μg/mL or appropriate units as
determined by the standard curve.
• Ensure all critical or abnormal results are reviewed and verified by
a supervisor or senior technologist before reporting.
1. QUALITY CONTROL AND MAINTENANCE:
• Perform routine maintenance and calibration of pipettes and
spectrophotometer.
• Perform internal QC with each run (two levels of controls) and
document results.
• Implement external proficiency testing as required.
• Conduct regular reagent validation and handle reagents per
manufacturer's guidelines.
1. LIMITATIONS:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric specimens may interfere with test
results.
• Improper storage of samples may lead to degradation of HCII and
affect accuracy.
• Ensure all steps are performed at indicated temperatures to avoid
variability.
• Refer to the assay kit insert for specific limitations related to the
analytical method.

• Relevant laboratory equipment user manuals
1. DOCUMENTATION:
• Record all results, including calibration curves, control results,
and patient results, in the laboratory information system (LIS).
• Document any discrepancies, corrective actions, and
maintenance activities comprehensively.
By following this protocol, the laboratory ensures accurate, reliable
results for the measurement of Heparin Cofactor II levels, thus
supporting better decision-making in patient care and management.
