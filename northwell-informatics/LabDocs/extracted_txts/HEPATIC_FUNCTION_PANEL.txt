Standard Operating Procedure for HEPATIC FUNCTION PANEL
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to provide a standardized method
for performing and reporting results for the Hepatic Function Panel in
a clinical laboratory setting. This ensures accurate monitoring of liver
function and assists in the diagnosis of hepatic diseases and
conditions.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing the
assay, quality control, and reporting results according to this SOP.
1. DEFINITION
The Hepatic Function Panel includes the following analytes:
• Alanine aminotransferase (ALT)
• Aspartate aminotransferase (AST)
• Alkaline phosphatase (ALP)
• Gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT)
• Total bilirubin
• Direct bilirubin
• Albumin
• Total protein
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Fully automated biochemistry analyzer (e.g., Roche Cobas,
Beckman Coulter AU Series)
• Calibrators, controls, and reagents specific to the hepatic panel
analytes
• Pipettes and tips
• Disposable gloves
• Lab coat
• Quality control material
• Specimen collection tubes (serum or plasma, preferably
heparinized)
1. PROCEDURE
Specimen:
Acceptable:
• Serum or plasma collected in appropriate tubes
• Serum samples should be allowed to clot and then separated by
centrifugation
Unacceptable:
• Hemolyzed, icteric, or lipemic samples, as these may interfere
with the tests.
A) Sample Preparation:
1. Ensure that serum or plasma samples are properly labeled and
match the accession log.
2. Centrifuge specimens at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes.
3. Aliquot the serum/plasma into sample cups, if necessary.
B) Sample Testing:
1. Set up the biochemistry analyzer according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Load samples, calibrators, and controls onto the sample tray or
rack.
3. Verify the reagents specific for the hepatic function panel are
loaded on the analyzer.
4. Program the analyzer to perform the assay for the following
tests:
◦ ALT
◦ AST
◦ ALP
◦ GGT
◦ Total bilirubin
◦ Direct bilirubin
◦ Albumin
◦ Total protein
5. Initiate the run and allow the analyzer to process samples
automatically.
C) Quality Control:
1. Run quality control material at the beginning of each shift and
with each new lot of reagents.
2. Ensure that controls are within the specified range before
releasing patient results.
3. Troubleshoot any out-of-range controls by checking for possible
sources of error (e.g., reagent issues, instrument malfunction)
and repeating controls as necessary.
D) Reporting Results:
1. Review the results generated by the analyzer.
2. Verify that critical results are flagged and confirm them with
another technologist, if necessary.
3. Record results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
4. Follow site-specific reporting guidelines to release the results to
the healthcare provider.
5. Report any critical values immediately to the requesting
physician and document the communication.
6. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Reference ranges may differ slightly depending on the methodology
and analyzer used. Below are typical reference intervals:
• ALT: 7–56 U/L
• AST: 10–40 U/L
• ALP: 44–147 U/L
• GGT: 9–48 U/L
• Total bilirubin: 0.1–1.2 mg/dL
• Direct bilirubin: 0.0–0.3 mg/dL
• Albumin: 3.5–5.0 g/dL
• Total protein: 6.0–8.3 g/dL
1. QUALITY CONTROL
Internal and External Quality Control:
• Run quality control samples daily and with each batch of patient
samples.
• Participate in proficiency testing programs as appropriate.
• Document all quality control results and maintain records for
regulatory compliance.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the biochemistry analyzer’s user manual and the package
inserts for limitations specific to each analyte.
