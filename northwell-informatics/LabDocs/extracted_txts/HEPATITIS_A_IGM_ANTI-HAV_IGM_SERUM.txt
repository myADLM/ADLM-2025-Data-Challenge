Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Hepatitis A IgM (Anti-HAV,
IgM), Serum Testing
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the procedures for the analysis of Hepatitis A IgM
(Anti-HAV, IgM) in serum specimens. This test is used for the
qualitative detection of IgM antibodies specific to Hepatitis A virus
(HAV) to aid in the diagnosis of acute Hepatitis A infection.
1. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel involved in
performing and reporting results of Hepatitis A IgM (Anti-HAV, IgM)
tests in our CLIA-certified laboratory.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all designated laboratory personnel to follow
this SOP accurately and consistently and to ensure quality control
and quality assurance measures are taken. Any deviation from the
procedure must be documented and reported to the supervisor.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Serum
• Collection Tube: Use a red-top or serum separator tube (SST)
• Volume Required: Minimum of 0.5 mL of serum
• Collect and process specimens according to standard phlebotomy
techniques.
1. SPECIMEN HANDLING AND STORAGE
• Store specimens at 2-8°C if not tested immediately.
• For long-term storage, freeze specimens at -20°C or colder.
• Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
• Clearly label all specimens with patient identification and
collection date/time.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Hepatitis A IgM (Anti-HAV, IgM) test kit (specific manufacturer’s kit
to be used)
• Micropipettes and tips
• Suitable microplate reader
• Calibrated incubator at 37°C
• Test tubes and racks
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
• Controls (negative, positive, and quality controls included in the
test kit)
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation
1. Bring all reagents, specimens, and controls to room
temperature (18-25°C) before use.
2. Set up and calibrate the microplate reader according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
B. Assay Procedure
1. Set up the microplate and add specimens, controls, and
standards according to the test kit instructions.
2. Pipette the required volume of each serum specimen, control,
and calibrator into the appropriate wells.
3. Add the enzyme conjugate to all wells, cover the plate with a
protective lid, and incubate at 37°C for the time specified by the
manufacturer (e.g., 30 minutes).
4. Wash the plate thoroughly as per the manufacturer’s
instructions to remove unbound conjugates. Follow the wash
process defined in the kit to ensure the adequacy of the wash
steps.
5. Add the specified substrate solution to each well. Incubate in
the dark at room temperature for the time specified by the
manufacturer.
6. Stop the reaction by adding the stopping solution provided in
the kit.
7. Read the absorbance of the wells at the appropriate
wavelength (usually 450 nm with a 620-650 nm reference filter)
using a microplate reader.
C. Quality Control
1. Run positive, negative, and internal quality control samples with
each assay batch.
2. Document and review control results to ensure they are within
the acceptable ranges provided by the manufacturer.
3. If control results are out of range, do not proceed with patient
sample analysis. Investigate the cause and repeat the test or
initiate troubleshooting steps.
D. Interpretation of Results
1. Calculate the mean absorbance value for each sample and
control.
2. Determine the cut-off value based on the manufacturer’s
instructions.
3. Interpret positive or negative results for each specimen by
comparing the absorbance values to the cut-off value.
◦ Positive: Absorbance value > Cut-off value
◦ Negative: Absorbance value ≤ Cut-off value
4. REPORTING RESULTS
5. Record results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
following laboratory reporting guidelines.
6. Review and verify results before releasing them to the treating
physician.
7. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the manufacturer’s package insert for specific limitations of
the test, including potential interferences, and ensure these are
considered when interpreting results.
