Standard Operating Procedure Title: Analytical Phase of Generating
Results for Hepatitis A, Total (IgG, IgM), Serum
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedure
for the analytical phase of generating results for Hepatitis A,
Total (IgG, IgM) in serum samples. This includes the steps
required for preparation, instrument operation, quality control,
result generation, and verification. Adherence to this procedure
ensures accurate, reliable, and reproducible results, consistent
with CLIA guidelines.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for
performing the procedure detailed in this SOP. Supervisory staff are
responsible for ensuring all personnel are trained and competent in
performing this procedure, and for reviewing and certifying the final
results.
1. DEFINITION Hepatitis A Total (IgG, IgM) testing includes both
IgG and IgM antibodies to Hepatitis A virus. This test helps in
the diagnosis of past or current Hepatitis A infection and can be
used to assess immunity status.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS Preferred Specimen: Serum •
Collect blood in a red-top or serum separator tube. • Separate
serum from cells as soon as possible, ideally within 2 hours of
collection. • Minimum volume required for testing: 1 mL serum •
Specimens can be stored at 2-8°C for up to 7 days. For longer
storage, specimens can be frozen at -20°C or colder.
Unacceptable Specimens: • Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric
specimens. • Specimens stored at room temperature for more than
24 hours.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES • Immunoassay
analyzer (specific brand/model as per lab setup, e.g., Abbott
Architect, Roche Elecsys) • Hepatitis A Total (IgG, IgM) reagent
kit • Quality control sera (positive and negative controls) •
Calibrators • Micropipettes and appropriate tips • Protective
personal equipment (PPE)
2. PROCEDURE
Preparation: • Allow reagent kits, calibrators, and controls to come to
room temperature before use. • Ensure that the immunoassay
analyzer is calibrated and ready for use. • Wear appropriate PPE.
Calibration: • Perform calibration using the calibrators provided with
the reagent kit following the manufacturer's guidelines. • Record
calibration data in the instrument calibration log.
Sample Preparation: • Thaw frozen serum samples at room
temperature and mix gently before analysis. • Load the serum
samples, controls, and calibrators into the sample rack of the
analyzer according to the instrument's instructions.
Instrument Operation: • Select the appropriate test method for
Hepatitis A Total (IgG, IgM). • Run the samples using the
preprogrammed settings. • Ensure that control samples are included
in the run and that their values fall within the acceptable range prior
to analyzing patient samples.
Quality Control: • Run positive and negative controls at the beginning
of each shift or with each new lot of reagents. • Document control
results in the Quality Control Log. • If control results fall outside the
acceptable range, troubleshoot according to the manufacturer’s
guidelines and do not proceed with patient sample analysis until the
issue is resolved.
Result Generation: • The analyzer will automatically generate and
record results. • Once analysis is complete, review the generated
results to ensure they fall within the instrument’s linear range.
Verification: • Verify that the control results are within the acceptable
range. • Review patient results for any inconsistencies or flags.
Repeat any tests if necessary.
Reporting: • Transmit verified results to the Laboratory Information
System (LIS). • Enter any additional comments or notes as required.
Sample integrity: • If there are any issues with sample integrity (e.g.,
hemolysis, lipemia, or icterus), note this in the report. Use best
judgment for reporting such samples.
Critical Values: • Critical results for Hepatitis A Total (IgG, IgM) (e.g.,
IgM positive indicating acute infection) should be urgently
communicated to the requesting healthcare provider and
documented.
