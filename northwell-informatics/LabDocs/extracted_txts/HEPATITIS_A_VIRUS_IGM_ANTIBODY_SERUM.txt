Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Title: Analytical Phase for
Generating Results for Hepatitis A Virus IgM Antibody, Serum
1. PURPOSE To outline the procedure for the analysis of Hepatitis
A Virus (HAV) IgM Antibody in serum to ensure accurate and
reliable test results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY It is the responsibility of the designated
laboratory personnel to follow this SOP for the analysis of HAV
IgM Antibodies. All personnel must be properly trained and
certified to perform the test, record results, and undertake
necessary corrective actions.
3. SPECIMEN a. Acceptable Specimen:
◦ Serum is the required specimen type.
◦ Collect blood using standard venipuncture technique.
◦ Allow blood to clot at room temperature and centrifuge to
separate serum.
b. Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
• Specimens collected in tubes containing anticoagulants.
• Specimens not stored at recommended temperatures.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• HAV IgM ELISA Kit (or equivalent preferred by the laboratory)
• Micropipettes and tips
• Calibrated ELISA reader and washer
• Microtiter plates
• Incubator set at 37°C
• Distilled water
• Disposable gloves and personal protective equipment (PPE)
• Serum separation tubes
1. PROCEDURE a. Preparation:
◦ Ensure all reagents and specimens are at room temperature
before use.
◦ Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for the HAV IgM
ELISA kit.
b. Test Setup:
1. Label microtiter plate clearly.
2. Dilute patient serum and controls if required as per the
manufacturer's instructions.
3. Add a specified volume (usually 100 µL) of patient serum,
controls, and calibrators into designated wells.
4. Add HAV IgM antibody conjugate to each well.
5. Cover the plate and incubate at 37°C for the manufacturer's
specified duration.
c. Washing and Detection:
1. Wash the plate with the ELISA washer as per the kit instructions
(typically 3-4 washes with wash buffer).
2. Add substrate solution to each well.
3. Incubate in the dark at room temperature for the time specified
by the kit manufacturer.
d. Reading Results:
1. Stop the reaction by adding the stop solution to each well in the
order of substrate addition.
2. Read the optical density (OD) at the wavelength specified by
the ELISA kit (usually 450 nm) using the ELISA reader within
the recommended time frame.
3. QUALITY CONTROL a. Internal quality control:
◦ Run positive and negative controls with each batch of tests.
◦ Ensure the controls fall within the specified ranges provided
by the kit manufacturer.
b. Proficiency testing:
• Participate in external proficiency testing programs as required.
• Cross-check inter-laboratory results periodically.
1. RESULTS INTERPRETATION a. Calculate the OD for each
specimen. b. Compare the values against the cutoff value
specified by the manufacturer.
◦ Positive result: OD ≥ cutoff value indicates the presence of
HAV IgM antibodies.
◦ Negative result: OD < cutoff value indicates the absence of
HAV IgM antibodies. c. Record the results in the LIS
(Laboratory Information System).
2. REPORTING RESULTS
• Transmit results to the LIS.
• Review and verify results before finalizing and reporting.
• Follow site-specific reporting guidelines for critical and non-critical
results.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to the ELISA kit insert for specific limitations such as cross-
reactivity and potential interferences.
• Ensure proper sample handling and storage to prevent
inaccuracies.
