Hepatitis A Virus (HAV) Total Antibodies, Serum SOP
1. PURPOSE
This procedure outlines the steps for the accurate and reliable
analysis of Hepatitis A Virus (HAV) total antibodies in serum
specimens. The purpose is to detect the presence of antibodies,
indicating either previous infection with HAV or immunization.
Responsibility:
Laboratory personnel are responsible for performing the analysis
according to this SOP and ensuring the accuracy and validity of the
test results. Supervisors must ensure compliance with the protocol
and provide guidance for troubleshooting when necessary.
1. SPECIMEN COLLECTION AND HANDLING
Preferred Specimen:
• 5-10 mL serum collected in a red-top or serum separator tube
(SST).
• Serum should be separated from cells within 2 hours of collection.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens collected in anticoagulant tubes such as EDTA or
heparin.
• Specimens with gross hemolysis, lipemia, or contamination.
• Specimens not processed or stored appropriately.
Storage:
• Store serum at 2-8°C for up to 7 days.
• For extended storage, freeze serum at -20°C or lower. Avoid
repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Automated Immunoassay Analyzer (Analyzer model and version)
• HAV Total Antibodies kit (manufacturer and catalog number)
• Calibrators and controls specific to HAV Total Antibodies kit
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
1. QUALITY CONTROL AND CALIBRATION
Quality Control:
• Run internal quality controls with every batch of tests: negative
and positive controls.
• Ensure control results fall within the expected range. If controls
fail, do not report patient results until issue is resolved.
Calibration:
• Calibrate the analyzer according to manufacturer instructions
before testing new lots of kits and routinely as recommended by
the manufacturer.
• Document calibration results and corrective actions if calibration
fails.
1. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Bring all reagents and serum specimens to room temperature
prior to analysis.
2. Ensure all equipment is functioning properly and calibrated.
Assay:
1. Load serum specimens, calibrators, and quality control
materials onto the analyzer.
2. Follow the manufacturer's instructions to run the HAV Total
Antibodies immunoassay.
3. Ensure proper identification of specimens, calibrators, and
controls to avoid mix-ups.
Result Interpretation:
1. Analyze the results following the standard operating procedures
of the analyzer.
2. Positive Result: Presence of HAV total antibodies.
3. Negative Result: Absence of HAV total antibodies.
4. Invalid Result: Repeat testing if control failures or issues with
specimen condition are detected.
5. REPORTING RESULTS
6. Verify results as per laboratory standard guidelines.
7. Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS) for
final review.
8. Ensure proper documentation including date, time, and initials
of the technologist performing the test.
9. Report critical results immediately to the healthcare provider as
per laboratory policy.
Reference Intervals:
• Positive: HAV total antibodies detected.
• Negative: HAV total antibodies not detected.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Interferences such as heterophilic antibodies may affect the
accuracy of results.
• Follow manufacturer's instructions for troubleshooting and
limitations.
• Consult the kit insert for specific reagent pad limitations.
1. DOCUMENTATION AND RECORD KEEPING
• Record all QC, calibration, and patient results in designated logs.
• Maintain documentation in accordance with the laboratory's
record-keeping policies.
1. REFERENCES
• Kit manufacturer’s package insert and operation manual.
• Relevant medical and laboratory texts and articles on HAV
antibody testing.
1. REVISION HISTORY
• Document any changes or updates to the SOP including the
effective date and nature of changes.
