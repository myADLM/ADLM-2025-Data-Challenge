Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Hepatitis B Surface Antigen
(HBsAg) Detection in Serum
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for the detection of Hepatitis B surface
antigen (HBsAg) in serum samples using enzyme immunoassay
(EIA), chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA), or other approved
methods. Accurate and timely identification of HBsAg is critical for
diagnosing Hepatitis B infection and monitoring patients with the
disease.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing the
assay, ensuring quality control measures are followed, and
documenting results as described in this procedure.
1. SPECIMEN
A. Specimen Type: - Serum
B. Collection and Handling: - Collect blood in a clot activator tube
(e.g., SST). - Allow blood to clot at room temperature, then centrifuge
to separate serum. - Ensure at least 1 mL of serum is available for
testing. - If not tested immediately, store serum at 2-8°C for up to 7
days or freeze at -20°C or lower for longer storage.
C. Unacceptable Specimens: - Samples with visible hemolysis,
lipemia, or icterus. - Specimens received in inappropriate containers
or tubes. - Samples received outside the acceptable temperature and
time constraints.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, SUPPLIES
◦ EIA/CLIA instrument (e.g., Abbott Architect, Roche Elecsys,
etc.)
◦ HBsAg assay kit (including controls and calibrators)
◦ Micropipettes and tips
◦ Centrifuge
◦ Clot activator tubes
◦ Personal protective equipment (PPE)
◦ Quality control materials
◦ Absorbent wipes
2. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation: - Wear appropriate PPE. - Turn on the instrument and
allow it to warm up according to the manufacturer's instructions. -
Ensure reagents, controls, and calibrators are at room temperature
and are within their expiration dates. - Prepare the required amount
of reagents, calibrators, and controls following the manufacturer's
instructions.
B. Calibration and Quality Control: - Calibrate the instrument using
the provided calibrators if due for recalibration, following the
manufacturer's instructions. - Run quality controls at the start of the
shift, after calibration, and before patient testing. - Ensure quality
control results are within the acceptable range before proceeding
with patient samples.
C. Testing Procedure: - Label each sample tube with the patient
identifier. - Load samples, controls, and calibrators onto the sample
rack. - Program the instrument for the HBsAg assay, including patient
and control identifiers. - Start the assay on the instrument, following
the manufacturer's provided protocol. - The instrument will
automatically perform the necessary pipetting, incubation, washing,
and reading steps.
D. Result Interpretation and Reporting: - Review results for controls
to ensure they fall within the expected ranges. - Positive control must
show a positive result, and negative control must show a negative
result. - For patient results, review and verify the generated data. -
Positive Result: Indicates the presence of HBsAg in the specimen. -
Negative Result: Indicates the absence of HBsAg in the specimen. -
Flag and investigate any invalid results or instrument errors. - Record
results in the laboratory information system (LIS). - Provide results
and any necessary comments or interpretations according to site-
specific reporting guidelines.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Maintain documentation of calibration, quality control
results, and any corrective actions taken.
◦ Perform scheduled instrument maintenance according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
◦ Validate new reagent lots with control materials before
routine use.
2. METHOD LIMITATIONS
◦ Specimen handling and storage conditions can affect the
assay results.
◦ Results should be interpreted in the context of patient's
clinical presentation and other diagnostic findings.
◦ Refer to the manufacturer's package insert for specific
limitations and interferences of the assay.
