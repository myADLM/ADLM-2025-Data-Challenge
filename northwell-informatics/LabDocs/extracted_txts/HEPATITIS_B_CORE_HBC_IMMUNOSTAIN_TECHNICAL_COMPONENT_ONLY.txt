Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Hepatitis B Core (HBC)
Immunostain
1. PURPOSE To ensure the accurate and reliable generation of
Hepatitis B Core (HBC) immunostain results, focusing on the
technical component only. This protocol outlines the procedural
steps for the analytical phase, including preparation, staining,
and result validation.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory technologists are responsible
for performing the staining process and documenting results. The
laboratory supervisor ensures adherence to the protocol and
addresses any issues that may arise.
1. DEFINITION The Hepatitis B Core (HBC) immunostain is used
to detect the presence of Hepatitis B Core antigen in liver
tissue, which is an indicator of Hepatitis B virus infection.
2. PROCEDURE
A) PREPARATION
1. Ensure all reagents, equipment, and slides are prepared and
available prior to staining.
2. Verify that the primary HBC antibody, secondary antibody, and
detection reagent are within expiry dates and stored according
to manufacturer's instructions.
3. Set up and calibrate automated stainers if being used, or
ensure manual staining stations are clean and organized.
B) STAINING PROCEDURE
1. Specimen Receiving and Accession
◦ Verify the patient's sample based on the identification
number and any relevant clinical information.
◦ Ensure tissue sections are properly fixed and embedded in
paraffin.
2. Slide Preparation
◦ Cut tissue sections at 4-5 micrometers thickness using a
microtome.
◦ Collect sections on positively charged microscope slides
and allow them to dry at room temperature.
3. Deparaffinization
◦ Immerse slides in xylene for 2-3 minutes twice, followed by
rehydration in decreasing concentrations of ethanol (100%,
95%, and 70%) and distilled water.
4. Antigen Retrieval
◦ Perform antigen retrieval using the appropriate method
(e.g., heat-induced epitope retrieval) with citrate buffer (pH
6.0) or EDTA buffer (pH 8.0). Heat slides in a pressure
cooker or water bath for 20 minutes and allow to cool.
5. Blocking Endogenous Activity
◦ Block endogenous peroxidase activity by incubating slides
in 3% hydrogen peroxide for 10 minutes, followed by
washing in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).
6. Primary Antibody Application
◦ Apply the primary HBC antibody to the sections and
incubate at room temperature for 30 minutes to 1 hour, as
recommended by the manufacturer.
7. Washing
◦ Wash slides thoroughly in PBS to remove any unbound
primary antibody (three washes of 5 minutes each).
8. Secondary Antibody Application
◦ Apply the secondary antibody/histochemical detection
reagent (e.g., HRP-conjugated secondary antibody) and
incubate for 20-30 minutes.
9. Detection
◦ Apply the chromogen substrate (e.g., DAB reagent) and
develop the reaction for 5-10 minutes until the desired color
intensity is achieved.
10. Counterstaining
◦ Counterstain slides using hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes,
followed by washing in tap water to remove excess stain.
11. Dehydration and Mounting
◦ Dehydrate slides through graded ethanol solutions (70%,
95%, 100%) and clear in xylene.
◦ Mount coverslip using a compatible mounting medium.
C) RESULT VALIDATION
1. Microscope Examination
◦ Examine stained slides under a microscope by a trained
technologist.
◦ Compare staining patterns to control sections and record
findings.
2. Documentation
◦ Log all observations, including any anomalies or quality
issues, in the appropriate laboratory information system
(LIS).
◦ Note and address any deviations from expected staining
patterns.
3. Quality Control
◦ Ensure positive and negative control slides are included in
each batch of staining to validate results.
D) REPORTING RESULTS
1. Transcription and Verification
◦ Enter results into the LIS following site-specific reporting
guidelines.
◦ Verify and review results before finalizing and releasing the
report to the ordering clinician.
