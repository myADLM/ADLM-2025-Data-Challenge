Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Hepatitis B Core IgG and
IgM (Anti-HBc IgG, IgM) Testing
1. PURPOSE
To provide detailed instructions for the analytical phase of testing for
Hepatitis B Core IgG and IgM antibodies (Anti-HBc IgG, IgM) in
serum samples. This will ensure accurate and reliable results that aid
in the diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring of Hepatitis B Virus (HBV)
infection.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory personnel, including medical laboratory
scientists and technicians, are responsible for performing the assay,
documenting the results, and ensuring compliance with this
procedure. Supervisors must ensure that all personnel are
adequately trained and competencies are assessed.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
3.1. Preferred specimen: Serum collected in a serum separator
tube (SST). 3.2. Volume: Minimum of 1 mL of serum is required.
3.3. Stability: - Specimens are stable for up to 72 hours at
2-8°C. - For long-term storage, specimens should be frozen at
-20°C or colder.
2. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
4.1. Equipment: - Microplate reader capable of measuring
absorbance at 450 nm and 620-630 nm. - Pipettes and tips
(variable volumes). - Centrifuge. - Incubator set at 37°C. 4.2.
Reagents: - Anti-HBc IgG, IgM ELISA kit (specific to the
manufacturer’s guidelines). - Wash buffer. - Substrate solution. -
Stop solution. - Controls (positive and negative). - Calibrators.
3. PROCEDURE
5.1. Preparation: - Allow all reagents and specimens to reach
room temperature before use. - Set up the microplate according
to the manufacturer’s instructions, ensuring that control and
calibrator wells are included.
5.2. Assay Procedure: 1. Sample Addition: - Add 100μL of
diluted serum samples, calibrators, and controls to the
respective wells.
2. **Incubation:**
- Incubate the plate at 37°C for 1 hour in the incubator.
3. **Washing:**
- Wash the wells 3-5 times with wash buffer to remove any unbound components.
4. **Detection Antibody:**
- Add 100μL of detection antibody (as per kit instructions) to each well.
- Incubate the plate at room temperature for the time specified by the manufacturer.
5. **Washing:**
- Wash the wells 3-5 times with wash buffer again.
6. **Substrate Addition:**
- Add 100μL of substrate solution to each well.
- Incubate the plate at room temperature (usually 15-30 minutes) in the dark to allow for color development.
7. **Stop Reaction:**
- Add 100μL of stop solution to each well to halt the reaction.
8. **Reading:**
- Measure the absorbance at 450 nm with a reference wavelength of 620-630 nm using a microplate reader.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
6.1. Ensure that positive and negative controls are included in
each run. 6.2. The test is valid if the following criteria are met: -
The positive control must fall within the established range. - The
negative control must have absorbance values lower than the
cut-off. 6.3. If controls do not meet the criteria, the run is invalid,
and the test must be repeated.
5. REPORTING RESULTS
7.1. Calculations: - Follow the manufacturer’s instructions to
calculate the sample results, typically involving the construction
of a standard curve with calibrators. - Results are expressed as
either qualitative (Positive/Negative) or quantitative units.
7.2. Interpretation: - Anti-HBc IgG Positive: Indicates past or
ongoing HBV infection. - Anti-HBc IgM Positive: Indicates
recent or acute HBV infection. - Negative results suggest the
absence of HBV core antibodies.
6. REFERENCE INTERVALS
◦ Anti-HBc IgG: Negative
◦ Anti-HBc IgM: Negative
7. METHOD LIMITATIONS
9.1. False positives or negatives can occur due to non-specific
binding or interfering substances in the sample. 9.2. Refer to
the ELISA kit insert for specific limitations related to the
individual reagent components.

9. DOCUMENTATION
◦ Record all test results, quality control data, and any
deviations from the SOP in the laboratory information
system (LIS) or appropriate log sheets.
◦ Maintain records of reagent lot numbers and test dates for
traceability.
This SOP must be reviewed and approved by senior laboratory
management and updated as necessary to ensure compliance with
the latest standards and guidelines.
