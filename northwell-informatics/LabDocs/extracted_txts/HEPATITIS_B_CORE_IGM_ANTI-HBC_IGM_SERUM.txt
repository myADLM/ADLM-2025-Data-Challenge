Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Hepatitis B Core IgM (Anti-HBc, IgM), Serum
1. PURPOSE To detail the procedures for the analysis,
verification, and reporting of Hepatitis B Core IgM (Anti-HBc,
IgM) in serum samples in order to ensure accurate and timely
results.
Responsibility: Designated staff, including laboratory technologists
and supervisors, are responsible for the proper execution of this
protocol and the validation and reporting of results.
1. DEFINITION Hepatitis B Core IgM (Anti-HBc, IgM) is an
antibody indicative of an acute or recent hepatitis B virus
infection.
2. PROCEDURE
Equipment and Reagents:
• Automated immunoassay analyzer (e.g., Chemiluminescent
Immunoassay Analyzer)
• Reagent kits specific for Anti-HBc IgM according to the
manufacturer's instructions
• Quality control materials
• Calibrators
• Sample tubes (primary patient samples)
Specimen Requirements:
• Preferred specimen type: Serum
• Specimen volume: Minimum of 0.5 mL serum
• Specimens must be properly labeled and identified with patient
information.
Specimen Stability:
• Serum samples are stable for up to 7 days when stored at 2-8°C.
• For longer storage, serum samples can be frozen at -20°C or
colder for up to 3 months.
Procedural Steps:
A) Pre-analytical phase:
1. Ensure the specimen has been properly collected, labeled,
received, and accessioned.
2. Verify the integrity of the sample (check for hemolysis, lipemia,
etc.). Reject any compromised specimens.
3. Bring refrigerated or frozen samples to room temperature and
mix thoroughly before analysis.
B) Calibration:
1. Perform calibration of the automated immunoassay analyzer as
required by the manufacturer's instructions and following
laboratory guidelines.
2. Use appropriate calibrators provided with the reagent kit.
C) Quality Control:
1. Run quality control materials (low, medium, and high levels)
according to the manufacturer's recommendations and
laboratory policy at the beginning of each shift.
2. Ensure quality control results are within acceptable ranges. If
not, troubleshoot and resolve issues before proceeding with
patient samples.
D) Testing Procedure:
1. Load the serum samples, calibrators, and quality control
materials onto the automated immunoassay analyzer as per
manufacturer's instructions.
2. Select the appropriate assay for Hepatitis B Core IgM (Anti-
HBc, IgM).
3. Start the run and monitor the analyzer for messages or alerts
indicating potential issues.
E) Post-analytical Phase:
1. Once the analysis is complete, verify the results against quality
control data. Review any flagged results.
2. For invalid or failed quality control results, troubleshoot, and re-
run the affected samples.
3. Document and immediately notify the supervisor in case of
persistent analyzer issues or deviations from acceptable QC
ranges.
4. REPORTING RESULTS A. Electronic Reporting:
5. Results will be automatically transmitted to the Laboratory
Information System (LIS) and require review and verification by
the technologist.
6. Critical results or significant abnormalities must be promptly
communicated to the appropriate healthcare provider as per
laboratory policy.
B. Manual Reporting:
1. In cases where electronic reporting is not feasible, manually
document results on the patient's report form and indicate any
critical values or abnormal findings.
2. REFERENCE INTERVALS Interpret results based on the
manufacturer's guide and laboratory-specific reference
intervals. Commonly:
• Negative: No detectable Hepatitis B Core IgM antibodies
• Positive: Presence of Hepatitis B Core IgM antibodies suggestive
of acute or recent infection
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS Refer to the specific reagent kit insert
for detailed information on individual test limitations, potential
interferences, and cross-reactivity.
2. QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE Regularly review and
assess quality control data to identify any trends requiring
corrective actions. Maintain comprehensive records of all
quality control materials, calibrations, and any corrective
actions taken.
3. SAFETY AND HANDLING Follow all biosafety protocols and
standard precautions when handling patient specimens,
reagents, and equipment. Dispose of biohazardous waste
according to institutional guidelines.
4. DOCUMENTATION Maintain all records for calibrations, quality
control, patient results, and corrective actions as per laboratory
regulatory requirements and standard operating procedures.

inserts for Hepatitis B Core IgM reagent kits and quality control
materials. Laboratory safety manual and standard precautions
guidelines. CLIA regulations and guidelines.
