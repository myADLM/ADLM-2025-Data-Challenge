Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Hepatitis B
Surface Antibody (Immune Status), Serum
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the analytical phase procedures for the detection
and quantification of Hepatitis B Surface Antibody (Anti-HBs) in
serum to determine immune status. This is done to monitor the
immunity status post-vaccination or post-infection recovery.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory staff trained and authorized to
conduct Hepatitis B Surface Antibody testing in our CLIA-certified
laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the
assay and ensuring all protocols are followed accurately.
• Supervisors are responsible for overseeing the testing process
and verifying results as needed.
4. SPECIMENS
4.1. Acceptable Specimens:
• Serum samples collected in a plain red-top tube or serum
separator tube (SST).
• Minimum volume: 1 mL of serum.
4.2. Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens received in tubes containing anticoagulants like EDTA,
heparin, or fluoride.
• Hemolyzed, icteric, and lipemic samples may interfere with assay
results.
• Specimens that are improperly labeled or received without
collection date/time.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• ELISA reader (e.g., Thermo Fisher Multiskan FC)
• Incubator capable of maintaining 37°C
• Microplate washer
• Pipettes and tips
• Hepatitis B Surface Antibody ELISA Kit (e.g., DiaSorin LIAISON®)
6. STORAGE
• Store ELISA kit reagents as per the manufacturer's instructions,
typically at 2-8°C.
• Do not use expired reagents or kits.
7. ANALYTICAL PHASE PROCEDURE
7.1. Sample Preparation:
1. Allow serum specimens and kit components to reach room
temperature.
2. Mix samples thoroughly before use. Avoid repeated freeze-thaw
cycles.
7.2. Assay Procedure:
1. Preparation of Working Reagents:
◦ Prepare working solutions of reagents as instructed in the
ELISA kit insert.
2. Plate Set-Up:
◦ Designate wells for calibrators, controls, and patient
samples.
◦ Refer to the kit’s instructions for volume to be added per
well.
3. Sample and Control Addition:
◦ Pipette calibrators, controls, and patient samples into
designated wells.
◦ Ensure pipetting accuracy and avoid cross-contamination.
4. Incubation:
◦ Incubate the plate at 37°C for the specified time (usually
30-60 minutes).
5. Washing:
◦ After incubation, wash the microtiter plate using the
automated microplate washer to remove unbound
components.
6. Conjugate Addition:
◦ Add enzyme-conjugate reagent to each well. Incubate
further at 37°C as per kit instructions.
7. Substrate Addition:
◦ Add substrate solution to each well and incubate for the
reaction time specified in the kit instructions.
8. Stop Solution:
◦ Add stop solution to each well to halt the enzymatic
reaction.
9. Measurement:
◦ Measure the absorbance at the specified wavelength
(typically 450 nm) using the ELISA reader.
7.3. Quality Control:
• Run positive and negative controls with each assay batch to
ensure the assay’s validity.
• Internal quality control materials should include at least two levels
of control (negative QC and positive QC).
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Calculate the anti-HBs concentrations using the standard curve
derived from the calibrators run in the assay.
• Refer to the kit insert for specific formulas needed for data
analysis.
• Results interpretation:
◦ <10 mIU/mL: Non-immune.
◦ ≥10 mIU/mL: Immune.
• Record and validate results in the laboratory information system
(LIS) following the site-specific reporting guidelines.
9. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Immune Status: ≥10 mIU/mL suggests immunity against Hepatitis
B.
10. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to the specific ELISA kit instructions for limitations
associated with the assay reagents and methodology.
