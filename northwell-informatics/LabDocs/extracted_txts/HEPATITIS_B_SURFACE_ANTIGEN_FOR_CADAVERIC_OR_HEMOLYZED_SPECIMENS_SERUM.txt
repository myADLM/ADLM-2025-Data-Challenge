Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Hepatitis B Surface Antigen (HBsAg) for
Cadaveric or Hemolyzed Specimens, Serum
1. PURPOSE
To outline the protocol for the accurate and reliable detection and
reporting of Hepatitis B Surface Antigen (HBsAg) in cadaveric or
hemolyzed serum specimens.
Responsibility:
All laboratory personnel processing and analyzing HBsAg tests are
responsible for adhering to this procedure and ensuring accurate
results.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND HANDLING
Specimen Collection:
• Serum from cadaveric or hemolyzed specimens.
• The specimen should be collected in a sterile, non-heparinized,
serum separation tube (SST).
Specimen Stability:
• Serum must be separated from cells within 2 hours of collection.
• Store serum at 2-8°C for up to 7 days or at -20°C or lower for
longer storage.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens with extensive hemolysis that could interfere with the
assay.
• Specimens with gross contamination or inadequate volume for
analysis.
Specimen Handling:
• Carefully inspect the specimen for signs of hemolysis or other
interferences.
• If extensive hemolysis or other issues that impede test
performance are identified, document and communicate the issue
to the requesting healthcare provider.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• HBsAg ELISA Kit (Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay)
• Microplate Reader capable of reading absorbance at 450 nm
• Incubator set at 37°C
• Micropipettes and tips
• Distilled or deionized water
• Timer
1. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
• Ensure all reagents are at room temperature (20-25°C) before
starting the assay.
• Prepare wash buffer and other reagents as per the
manufacturer’s instructions.
Testing Procedure:
1. Specimen Preparation:
◦ Thaw serum samples if frozen and bring to room
temperature.
◦ Thoroughly mix the serum by gentle inversion or vortexing.
Do not use specimens that have extensive hemolysis
without consulting a supervisor.
2. Plate Setup:
◦ Arrange the ELISA plate and record the position of each
sample, control, and calibrator.
◦ Add 100 µL of calibrators, controls, and prepared specimens
into their respective wells.
3. Incubation:
◦ Incubate the plate at 37°C for 60 minutes.
◦ After incubation, aspirate the content of the wells and wash
the plate five times with the prepared wash buffer.
4. Conjugate Addition:
◦ Add 100 µL of enzyme conjugate to each well.
◦ Incubate the plate at 37°C for 60 minutes.
◦ After the incubation, aspirate the content of the wells and
wash five times with the wash buffer.
5. Substrate Addition:
◦ Add 100 µL of TMB substrate to each well.
◦ Incubate the plate at room temperature (20-25°C) in the
dark for 30 minutes.
6. Stop Reaction:
◦ Add 100 µL of stop solution to each well.
7. Reading the Plate:
◦ Measure the absorbance at 450 nm using a microplate
reader within 30 minutes after adding the stop solution.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run positive and negative controls with each assay to ensure
proper performance.
• Verify that the control values fall within the expected ranges as
specified by the manufacturer.
• Document any deviations and perform troubleshooting as
necessary.
1. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
• The test results are interpreted based on the absorbance values.
• A specimen is considered reactive or positive if the absorbance
value is equal to or greater than the cutoff value.
• A specimen is considered non-reactive or negative if the
absorbance value is less than the cutoff value.
• Equivocal results should be reported and a new specimen may be
requested for re-testing if necessary.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Report results as “Reactive” or “Non-Reactive” based on the
absorbance values relative to the cutoff.
• Communicate any critical findings or uncertainties immediately to
the requesting healthcare provider.
• Document and archive all results as per laboratory protocol.
1. LIMITATIONS
• Results for hemolyzed specimens must be interpreted with
caution as high levels of hemoglobin may interfere with the assay.
• Certain cadaveric specimens may contain degradation products
that could affect the reliability of the results.
• Specifics about limitations and interferences can be found in the
manufacturer's package insert.
