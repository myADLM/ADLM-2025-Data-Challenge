Protocol for the Analytical Phase of Generating Results for Hepatitis
B Surface (HBS) Antigen Immunostain, Technical Component Only
1. PURPOSE
This protocol outlines the standard operating procedure for
performing Hepatitis B Surface (HBS) Antigen immunostaining on
tissue sections. The procedure is intended to ensure the accurate
and reliable staining of HBS antigen for the purpose of aiding in the
diagnosis of Hepatitis B infection. It covers only the technical
component of the immunostaining process.
1. SCOPE AND RESPONSIBILITY
This protocol is applicable to all trained laboratory personnel
performing the immunostaining procedure for HBS antigen in a CLIA-
certified laboratory. It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory
personnel to follow this procedure accurately and to document all
steps appropriately. The personnel must ensure that all quality control
measures are implemented to maintain the integrity of the results.
1. DEFINITIONS
• Hepatitis B Surface (HBS) Antigen: A protein on the surface of the
Hepatitis B virus; its presence indicates current Hepatitis B
infection.
• Immunostain: A laboratory method that uses antibodies to detect
antigens in tissue specimens, providing visual evidence under a
microscope.
• Technical Component: The portion of the immunostaining process
that involves preparation, staining, and initial assessment of the
tissue sections, excluding interpretation of results.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue
sections.
• Specimen Handling: Sections should be 4–5 microns thick and
placed on positively charged microscope slides. Slides should be
stored at room temperature and used within 2 weeks of
sectioning.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Primary Antibody: Monoclonal antibody specific to Hepatitis B
Surface Antigen.
• Detection System: An appropriate polymer-based or enzyme-
conjugated secondary antibody system.
• Chromogen/Substrate: DAB (3,3’-diaminobenzidine) or other
suitable chromogenic substrate.
• Automated Immunostainer: Programmable immunostaining
instrument.
• Xylene, ethanol, and distilled water for deparaffinization and
rehydration.
• Hematoxylin for counterstaining.
• Cover slips and mounting media.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Deparaffinization and Rehydration
1. Place the slides in xylene for 5 minutes and repeat twice to
ensure complete deparaffinization.
2. Rehydrate the slides through a series of graded ethanol
solutions (100%, 95%, 70%) and rinse in distilled water.
B. Antigen Retrieval
1. Perform antigen retrieval using a suitable method (e.g., heat-
induced epitope retrieval in citrate buffer, pH 6.0) as
recommended for the HBS antigen antibody.
2. Cool the slides to room temperature and rinse in distilled water.
C. Immunostaining
1. Load the slides onto the automated immunostainer.
2. Apply the primary antibody and incubate as recommended by
the manufacturer (typically 30 minutes to 1 hour).
3. Wash slides with automated stainer wash buffer.
4. Apply the detection system (secondary antibody) and incubate
as recommended.
5. Wash slides again with automated stainer wash buffer.
6. Apply the chromogen solution and incubate until optimal color
development is observed (typically 5–10 minutes).
7. Rinse slides thoroughly with distilled water.
D. Counterstaining
1. Counterstain slides with hematoxylin for 1–2 minutes.
2. Rinse slides in running tap water until clear.
3. Dehydrate slides through graded ethanol solutions (70%, 95%,
100%).
4. Clear slides in xylene and coverslip using mounting medium.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
• Positive and negative control slides must be included in each run
to ensure staining accuracy.
• The positive control should demonstrate specific staining for HBS
antigen.
• The negative control should show no staining, confirming the
specificity of the primary antibody.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• The stained slides will be evaluated by a qualified pathologist who
will provide the final interpretation.
• Document all steps taken and any deviations from the procedure
in the laboratory information system (LIS).
• Ensure all slides are labeled correctly and retained for appropriate
retention periods as per laboratory policies.

system, and chromogen.

assurance programs.
This protocol shall be reviewed and updated periodically to reflect the
latest technological and procedural advancements. Compliance with
this protocol ensures the accuracy and reliability of the HBS antigen
immunostaining results.
