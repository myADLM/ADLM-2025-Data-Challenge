Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Hepatitis B Virus Core-
Related Antigen, Quantitative, Serum (HBcrAg Quantification)
1. PURPOSE
This protocol outlines the procedure for the quantitative
measurement of Hepatitis B Virus Core-Related Antigen (HBcrAg) in
serum. The purpose is to provide accurate and reliable results for
HBcrAg quantification to aid in the monitoring and management of
Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) infection.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
Qualified laboratory personnel trained in this specific procedure are
responsible for performing the testing, ensuring quality control, and
reporting results.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
3.1. Acceptable Specimen
• Serum obtained from blood collected in a red-top or serum
separator tube (SST).
• A minimum of 2 mL of serum is required for testing.
3.2. Unacceptable Specimens
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric specimens.
• Specimens collected in anticoagulant tubes (e.g., EDTA, heparin).
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
4.1. Equipment
• Automated immunoassay analyzer (e.g., Abbott ARCHITECT
i2000SR, Roche Cobas e411)
• Calibrated micropipettes and tips
• Centrifuge for serum separation
4.2. Reagents and Supplies
• HBcrAg Quantitative Kit (specific to analyzer)
• Control materials (Low, Medium, and High)
• Calibration standards
• Disposable gloves and laboratory coat
5. QUALITY CONTROL
5.1. Internal Quality Control
• Run internal quality control materials (Low, Medium, High) with
each batch of patient samples.
• Verify that all control results are within the manufacturer’s
specified ranges before validating patient results.
5.2. External Quality Control
• Participate in a recognized external quality assessment (EQA)
program to ensure method accuracy and precision regularly.
6. PROCEDURE
6.1. Preparation
• Assemble all necessary equipment, reagents, and supplies before
starting the assay.
• Ensure all reagents are at room temperature before use.
• Label patient specimens, controls, and calibrators with
appropriate identifiers.
6.2. Serum Preparation
• Centrifuge blood collection tubes at 1500-2000 x g for 10 minutes
to separate serum.
• Transfer the serum to labeled aliquot tubes, avoiding
contamination.
• If not tested immediately, store serum samples at 2-8°C for up to
7 days or freeze at -20°C for longer storage.
6.3. Assay Setup
• Load the serum samples, controls, and calibrators onto the
automated immunoassay analyzer as per the manufacturer's
instructions.
• Ensure the correct assay protocol for HBcrAg quantification is
selected on the analyzer.
• Initiate the run and monitor the analyzer for any technical issues.
6.4. Processing and Analysis
• The analyzer will automatically process the samples and controls.
• Verify that the control results are within acceptable ranges.
• If control results are out of range, troubleshoot according to the
manufacturer's instructions and repeat the controls and patient
samples.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
7.1. Result Review
• Review the generated results for any flags or error messages.
• Confirm that all quality control results are within acceptable limits.
7.2. Result Documentation
• Document patient results in the laboratory information system
(LIS).
• Critical results should be verified and communicated to the
requesting physician as per laboratory policy.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
8.1. Interferences
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, and icteric samples may affect the accuracy
of the results.
• Incorrect sample handling, such as extensive freeze-thaw cycles,
may alter the antigen concentration.
8.2. Limit of Detection
• Ensure to report results only within the valid measurement range
of the assay, as specified in the reagent kit insert.

Note: This protocol must be reviewed and approved by the laboratory
supervisor and/or the medical director. Staff should be trained on this
SOP and competency assessments should be conducted periodically
to ensure adherence to the procedure.
