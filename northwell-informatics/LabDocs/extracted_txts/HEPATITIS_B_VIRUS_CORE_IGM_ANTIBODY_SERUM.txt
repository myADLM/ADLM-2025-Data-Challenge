Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Hepatitis B Virus Core IgM Antibody, Serum
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to provide standardized guidelines
for the analytical phase of testing for Hepatitis B Virus Core IgM
Antibody in serum samples. This procedure ensures accurate and
reliable results are obtained and reported in a timely manner.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing the
steps outlined in this procedure and ensuring all equipment,
reagents, and materials are used correctly. It is also the responsibility
of laboratory personnel to document and report the test results
accurately.
2. DEFINITION
Hepatitis B Virus Core IgM Antibody (HBcIgM) is a serological marker
indicating acute or recent Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) infection. The
presence of HBcIgM antibodies in serum is indicative of an active or
recent hepatic infection.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred Specimen: Serum collected in a clot activator tube
(red-top or serum separator tube).
• Minimum Volume: 1-2 mL of serum.
• Stability:
◦ Serum is stable at room temperature (18-25°C) for up to 8
hours.
◦ Serum is stable refrigerated (2-8°C) for up to 48 hours.
◦ Serum is stable frozen (−20°C or lower) for up to 3 months.
• Unacceptable Specimens:
◦ Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
◦ Specimens stored at inappropriate temperatures or beyond
the acceptable stability windows.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND MATERIALS
• Equipment:
◦ Micropipettes and tips.
◦ Centrifuge.
◦ Incubator.
◦ Plate reader (450 nm filter).
• Reagents:
◦ HBV Core IgM Antibody ELISA Kit.
◦ Positive and Negative controls.
◦ Washing buffer.
◦ Stop solution.
◦ Substrate solution (TMB or equivalent).
◦ Dilution buffer (if applicable).
5. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation:
1. Ensure all reagents and equipment are at room temperature
before use.
2. Allow the patient serum samples, controls, and standards to
reach room temperature.
B. Assay Procedure:
1. Sample and Reagent Preparation:
◦ Prepare the washing buffer as indicated in the kit
instructions.
◦ Prepare and label the microplate wells for standards,
controls, and patient samples.
2. Addition of Serum Samples:
◦ Add 100 µL of controls and standards to the appropriate
wells.
◦ Add 100 µL of patient serum samples to the designated
wells.
3. Incubation:
◦ Incubate the plate at 37°C for 60 minutes in a humidified
chamber to prevent evaporation.
4. Washing:
◦ Wash the wells 5 times with 300 µL of washing buffer.
Ensure the complete removal of liquid after each wash.
5. Addition of Conjugate:
◦ Add 100 µL of enzyme-conjugated anti-HBcIgM to each
well.
◦ Incubate the plate at 37°C for 30 minutes.
6. Washing:
◦ Wash the wells 5 times with 300 µL of washing buffer.
7. Addition of Substrate Solution:
◦ Add 100 µL of the substrate solution to each well.
◦ Incubate the plate at room temperature in the dark for 10-15
minutes.
8. Stopping the Reaction:
◦ Add 100 µL of stop solution to each well to terminate the
enzymatic reaction.
9. Reading the Plate:
◦ Read the absorbance at 450 nm using a microplate reader
within 30 minutes of stopping the reaction.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Internal Quality Control:
◦ Run positive and negative controls with each assay batch to
ensure the validity of the test results.
◦ Acceptable ranges for controls should be defined as per the
manufacturer's instructions. Control values must fall within
these ranges for the assay to be valid.
◦ Repeat the assay if the controls do not perform as expected.
2. External Quality Control:
◦ Participate in an external quality assessment program for
HBcIgM antibody testing, if available.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Calculation of Results:
◦ Calculate the mean absorbance value for each control and
sample.
◦ Use the cutoff value provided in the kit to determine the
positivity or negativity of the samples.
2. Interpretation:
◦ Positive: Absorbance values above the cutoff value indicate
the presence of HBcIgM antibody.
◦ Negative: Absorbance values below the cutoff value indicate
the absence of HBcIgM antibody.
3. Documentation:
◦ Record the results in the laboratory information system
(LIS).
◦ Ensure all results are reviewed and verified by a qualified
technologist before reporting.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Cross-reactivity may occur with other immunoglobulins or
antibodies.
• False positives or negatives may arise due to improper sample
handling, storage, or procedural deviations.
• Comprehensive clinical history and additional diagnostic
information should be considered when interpreting test results.
