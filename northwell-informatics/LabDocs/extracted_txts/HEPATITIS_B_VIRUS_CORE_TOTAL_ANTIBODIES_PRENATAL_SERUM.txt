Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Generating Results for
Hepatitis B Virus Core Total Antibodies Prenatal, Serum
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this protocol is to outline the steps for generating
results for Hepatitis B Virus Core Total Antibodies Prenatal, Serum in
a CLIA-certified laboratory.
Responsibility: All designated laboratory staff are responsible for
conducting the test according to this procedure and documenting the
results accurately.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type:
• Serum
Collection Container:
• Red-top or gold-top (serum separator) tube
Volume:
• Minimum of 1 mL of serum is required for the test.
Specimen Stability:
• Room Temperature: 2 days
• Refrigerated (2-8°C): 7 days
• Frozen (-20°C or below): 30 days
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens that are grossly hemolyzed
• Specimens received in expired or incorrect collection containers
• Specimens without appropriate labeling (patient identification,
collection date/time)
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Hepatitis B Core Total Antibody Testing Kit (validated and not
expired)
• Calibrators/Standards, as specified by the kit manufacturer
• Quality control materials (positive and negative controls)
• Pipettes (calibrated and verified for accuracy)
• Centrifuge
• Incubator (if required by the test procedure)
• Microplate reader or Analyzer
1. PROCEDURE
Pre-Analytical Phase:
1. Verify patient identity and test requisition information against
specimen labeling.
2. Centrifuge serum separator tube for 10 minutes at 1000-2000 g
to separate serum from blood cells.
3. Transfer serum into appropriately labeled secondary tube if
necessary.
4. Ensure specimens meet the acceptance criteria listed above.
Analytical Phase:
1. Prepare reagents, calibrators, and quality controls according to
the kit manufacturer's instructions.
2. Load serum specimens, calibrators, and quality controls onto
the appropriate assay platform (microplate or analyzer).
Note: Follow detailed instructions provided in the kit insert for
steps such as incubation, washing, and signal detection.
3. Start the reaction process by following these steps:
◦ Add specified volume of serum to reaction wells.
◦ Add conjugate and substrate solutions according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
◦ Incubate for the recommended time and temperature.
◦ Wash wells to remove unbound material.
◦ Read absorbance or fluorescence using microplate reader/
analyzer within the specified time frame.
4. Verify that quality control results are within acceptable limits
before approving patient results.
◦ If quality control fails, troubleshoot according to
manufacturer’s guidelines and repeat the test.
◦ Document all quality control data.
Post-Analytical Phase:
1. After analysis, validate the assay results by reviewing all
outputs (e.g., optical density values).
2. Complete result interpretation using kit-specific cutoff values for
reactive and non-reactive outcomes:
◦ Reactive: Indicates presence of total antibodies to Hepatitis
B core antigen.
◦ Non-reactive: Indicates absence of total antibodies to
Hepatitis B core antigen.
3. Input results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS) for
review and verification.
4. Review flagged results (out-of-range or critical values) as per
laboratory policy. Ensure any significant findings are
communicated to the healthcare provider promptly.
Quality Control:
1. Perform quality control testing with each assay batch using both
positive and negative controls. Document results and ensure
they fall within the acceptable range.
2. Record and review quality control logs regularly to identify any
trends or issues.
Reporting Results:
1. Report results according to site-specific reporting guidelines.
Ensure results are transmitted accurately to the LIS.
2. Maintain records of all testing and associated quality control
data.
Reference Intervals:
• Non-Reactive: No antibodies detected
• Reactive: Antibodies detected
Method Limitations:
• Refer to the testing kit insert for specific limitations of the assay.
References:
• Manufacturer’s kit insert for detailed instructions and
specifications
• Local laboratory guidelines and regulatory documents
This protocol ensures standardized processing for generating
accurate and reliable results for Hepatitis B Virus Core Total
Antibodies Prenatal testing.
