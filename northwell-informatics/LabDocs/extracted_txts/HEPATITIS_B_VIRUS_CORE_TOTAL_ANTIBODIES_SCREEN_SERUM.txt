Standard Operating Procedure for the Analytical Phase of
Hepatitis B Virus Core Total Antibodies Screen, Serum
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedure for the analytical
phase of generating results for Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) core total
antibodies (anti-HBc) screening in serum specimens. This test is
intended to determine the presence of antibodies against the core
antigen of HBV, which indicates previous or ongoing infection with
HBV.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory technologists are responsible for
performing the assay and ensuring the results are accurate and
reliable.
• Supervisors are responsible for overseeing the procedures and
addressing any issues that may arise during the testing process.
1. SPECIMEN
Preferred/acceptable:
• Freshly collected serum samples. The specimen should be a
minimum of 1 mL of serum obtained by centrifugation of whole
blood collected in a red-top, SST (serum separator tube), or other
appropriate collection tube.
Unacceptable:
• Specimens collected in EDTA, heparin, or any other
anticoagulants.
• Specimens with gross hemolysis, lipemia, or icterus that may
interfere with the assay.
• Specimens that are improperly labeled, without the collection
date/time, or outside the stability limits defined below.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• ELISA Reader and Washer
• HBV core total antibodies ELISA kit (including reagents, control
sera, and calibration standards)
• Micropipettes and tips
• Incubator
• Timer
• Absorbent paper
• Disposable gloves
• Laboratory coat and protective eyewear
1. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Handling and Preparation:
1. Upon receipt, check specimen condition, and match with the
accompanying requisition form.
2. Centrifuge samples if whole blood is received and separate the
serum.
3. Aliquot serum into appropriately labeled tubes and store at
2-8°C if testing within 5 days or -20°C for longer storage
periods.
B. Test Procedure:
1. Allow serum samples, controls, and reagents to come to room
temperature.
2. Arrange microplate according to test layout defined in the kit’s
protocol, ensuring neat separation between samples and
control wells.
3. Prepare working reagents as per manufacturer instructions.
4. Using a micropipette, add an aliquot of the diluted conjugate
reagent to each well.
5. Add the serum sample (100 µL), control sera, and calibration
standards to their respective wells.
6. Gently tap the plate to ensure proper mixing and coverage.
7. Incubate the plate at 37°C for the specified duration per the kit
instructions.
8. Wash the wells with the provided washing buffer, then tap to
remove excess wash solution.
9. Add the substrate solution to each well (100 µL), incubate for
the duration specified in the kit instructions while shielding the
plate from light.
10. Add the stop solution (50 µL) to each well in the same
sequence as substrate addition to ensure even stop-time.
C. Measurement and Analysis:
1. Read the optical density (OD) at the specified wavelength
(usually 450 nm) on the ELISA reader within the time specified
in the kit instructions.
2. Record OD values and use them to calculate the cut-off value
for HBV core total antibodies screening according to the
calibration standards provided in the kit.
3. QUALITY CONTROL
4. Run positive and negative control sera with each batch of
samples to ensure assay performance.
5. Ensure that control values fall within the established acceptable
range. If not, investigate possible sources of error and repeat
the assay.
6. Use internal data review processes and a preventive
maintenance schedule for the ELISA reader and washer.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
8. Record the OD values and calculated results in the laboratory
information system (LIS).
9. Verify results for any discrepancies and take corrective actions
as necessary (re-testing, additional controls).
10. Report positive, negative or equivocal outcomes as specified in
the procedure and per the established medical decision points.
11. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Negative: Indicates no detectable HBV core total antibodies.
• Positive: Indicates detectable HBV core total antibodies
suggesting previous or ongoing infection with HBV.
• Equivocal: Borderline results that may require retesting or
additional confirmatory testing.

total antibodies ELISA kit.

guidelines.
1. SAFETY AND WASTE DISPOSAL
2. Adhere to the standard biological safety protocols, including the
use of personal protective equipment (PPE).
3. Dispose of all biohazard wastes according to the laboratory
safety manual and jurisdictional regulations.
