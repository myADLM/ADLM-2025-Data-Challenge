STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP) FOR HEPATITIS B
VIRUS CORE TOTAL ANTIBODIES, SERUM
Purpose
To outline the procedure for the analysis and result generation of
Hepatitis B Virus Core Total Antibodies (HBcAb) in serum samples to
ensure accurate and reliable clinical results.
Specimen
Preferred/acceptable:
• Serum collected from a blood draw into a red-top tube or serum
separator tube (SST).
• Specimens should be centrifuged promptly after collection to
separate the serum. The serum must be stored at 2-8°C if testing
is not performed within 8 hours of collection.
• Specimens are stable for up to 7 days at 2-8°C or longer if frozen
at -20°C.
Unacceptable:
• Specimens that are hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric.
• Specimens collected in tubes containing anticoagulants (e.g.
EDTA, heparin, citrate).
• Specimens where the serum is not properly separated or is
contaminated.
Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies
• Automated immunoassay analyzer (e.g., Chemiluminescence
Immunoassay Analyzer)
• HBcAb reagents and calibrators
• Quality control materials (Positive and Negative)
• Serum separation tubes
• Pipettes and associated calibration tools
• Centrifuge
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
Procedure
1. Preparation
◦ Ensure all equipment is calibrated and functioning as per
manufacturer instructions.
◦ Prepare reagents and quality control materials according to
manufacturer’s protocol.
◦ Verify that the serum samples are properly labeled and meet
acceptance criteria.
2. Calibration
◦ Calibrate the analyzer using the HBcAb calibrators provided
by the reagent manufacturer.
◦ Ensure calibration results fall within acceptable ranges
before proceeding with specimen testing.
3. Quality Control
◦ Run positive and negative quality control materials at least
once every 24 hours or as per the laboratory’s policy.
◦ Document QC results and verify that they are within the
established acceptance ranges. If not within ranges,
troubleshoot the analyzer or reagents and recalibrate if
necessary.
4. Testing Procedure
◦ Load the serum samples and HBcAb reagents into the
automated immunoassay analyzer.
◦ Program the analyzer for the specific HBcAb test and start
the assay.
◦ Read and record the results from the analyzer once the test
is completed. Ensure results are automatically or manually
transmitted to the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
5. Review and Verification
◦ Verify all results before final reporting. Check for
consistency and repeat the test if results seem questionable
or if flagged by the analyzer.
◦ Confirm critical results and ensure to follow the laboratory’s
policy for reporting critical values.
Method Limitations
Refer to the reagent manufacturer’s protocol insert for specific
method limitations, including interferences and cross-reactivity with
other substances.
Reporting Results
• Results are reviewed by the technologist and verified in the LIS.
• Results are reported with the following reference intervals:
◦ Negative: < Cutoff value specified by the reagent
manufacturer.
◦ Positive: ≥ Cutoff value specified by the reagent manufacturer.
Documentation
• All temperature logs, calibration records, QC records, testing logs,
and any corrective actions must be documented and maintained
as per the laboratory’s policy.
References
• Manufacturer’s package insert for HBcAb reagents.
• Laboratory internal guideline and policies.
Quality Assurance
Ensure compliance with CLIA guidelines and the laboratory’s quality
assurance program, including regular proficiency testing and protocol
reviews.
Safety Precautions
All personnel must use appropriate PPE. Follow biosafety practices
to prevent exposure to infectious materials.
Review and Amendments
This SOP must be reviewed annually or as needed to incorporate
updates from newer versions of reagent and equipment protocols, or
changes in laboratory policy.
