STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP)
Analytical Phase Protocol: Hepatitis B
Virus Core Total Antibodies, with Reflex to
Hepatitis B Virus Core IgM Antibody,
Serum
1. PURPOSE
This procedure outlines the steps involved in the analysis of Hepatitis
B Virus (HBV) Core Total Antibodies with reflex to HBV Core IgM
Antibody in serum samples. This enables accurate and reliable
detection and differentiation of current or past HBV infection in
patients.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
• Designated laboratory technologists and clinical laboratory
scientists are responsible for performing the analyses as outlined.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring adherence to the
protocol.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Acceptable Specimen Types:
• 5 mL of serum collected in a serum-separator tube (SST).
• Serum should be separated from cells within 2 hours of collection.
Unacceptable Specimen Types:
• Hemolyzed or lipemic specimens.
• Specimens not centrifuged within the required time frame.
• Specimens that have not been maintained at proper storage
conditions.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Primary Equipment:
• Chemiluminescent Microparticle Immunoassay (CMIA) analyzer.
• Centrifuge.
Reagents:
• Hepatitis B Virus Core Total Antibody Assay Kit.
• Hepatitis B Virus Core IgM Antibody Assay Kit (for reflex testing).
• Control materials (positive and negative controls).
• Calibration materials.
5. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation
1. Ensure serum is separated from the blood cells and properly
labeled.
2. Allow serum to reach room temperature before analysis.
B. Primary Testing (HBV Core Total Antibodies)
1. Equipment Calibration and Maintenance:
◦ Perform a daily start-up, including calibration checks for the
CMIA analyzer.
◦ Run quality controls (QC) using both positive and negative
controls.
2. Analysis:
◦ Load patient specimens and controls onto the CMIA
analyzer according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Select the Hepatitis B Virus Core Total Antibodies assay on
the analyzer.
◦ Initiate the assay run.
3. Quality Check:
◦ Verify that the control results fall within the acceptable range
before proceeding with patient samples.
◦ If controls fail, troubleshoot the analyzer and assays per
manufacturer guidance, then repeat the QC and patient
samples.
4. Interpretation and Reporting:
◦ Results will be automatically flagged if they fall outside the
reference range.
◦ If HBV Core Total Antibodies are detected (positive result),
proceed with reflex testing for HBV Core IgM Antibodies.
C. Reflex Testing (HBV Core IgM Antibodies)
1. Preparation for Reflex Testing:
◦ Use the same serum sample that was positive for HBV Core
Total Antibodies.
◦ Ensure it is adequately stored and mixed before reflex
testing.
2. Reflex Analysis:
◦ Load the serum samples onto the CMIA analyzer.
◦ Select the Hepatitis B Virus Core IgM Antibody assay.
◦ Run the assay as per manufacturer’s instructions.
3. Quality Check:
◦ Verify and document results of controls to ensure assay
validity.
4. Interpretation and Reporting:
◦ Document results and interpretations in the Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
◦ Report findings including reflex results if applicable.
6. QUALITY CONTROL AND TROUBLESHOOTING
• QC Measures: Follow QC protocol for each batch of tests run.
Maintain logs of all QC results and corrective measures.
• Troubleshooting: Follow manufacturer’s troubleshooting
guidelines for respective analyzers and assays. Repeat QC and
patient test if issues arise.
7. LIMITATIONS
• Always refer to the assay kit inserts for limitations specific to each
assay.
• Possible interfering substances such as hemolysis, lipemia, and
icterus should be noted.
• Reflex testing should only be conducted if initial HBV Core Total
Antibodies are positive.
8. REFERENCE RANGES
• HBV Core Total Antibodies: Negative/Non-reactive.
• HBV Core IgM Antibodies: Negative/Non-reactive (perform only
if reflex testing criteria met).
9. DOCUMENTATION AND REPORTING
• All results must be documented in the laboratory records and LIS.
• Reviewed and verified by laboratory personnel before releasing
results.
• Critical values to be communicated as per lab policy.
10. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's Instructions for Use (IFU) for CMIA analyzer and
assay kits.
• Laboratory’s internal QC and SOP documentation.
