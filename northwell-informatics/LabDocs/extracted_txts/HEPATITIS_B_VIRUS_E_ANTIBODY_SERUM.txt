Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Generating Results for
Hepatitis B Virus E Antibody (Anti-HBe), Serum
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this document is to provide detailed, step-by-
step procedures for the analysis of Hepatitis B Virus E Antibody
(Anti-HBe) in serum samples. Accurate and reliable results are
crucial for patient diagnosis and management.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of all designated laboratory personnel to
ensure compliance with this SOP to accurately analyze serum
samples for Anti-HBe.
2. PRINCIPLE
The assay for determination of Anti-HBe levels is based on an
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technique. This
method detects the presence of antibodies against the Hepatitis
B virus e antigen (HBeAg).
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred Specimen:
◦ Serum collected in a Red-top or serum separator tube
(SST).
Specimen Handling:
◦ After collection, allow the blood to clot at room temperature
for at least 30 minutes but no longer than 2 hours.
◦ Centrifuge the tube at 1,300-2,000 x g for 10 minutes to
separate the serum.
◦ Transfer the serum to a labeled storage tube if not directly
analyzed.
Specimen Stability:
◦ Room Temperature: Up to 8 hours.
◦ Refrigerated (2-8°C): Up to 7 days.
◦ Frozen (-20°C or colder): Long term storage.
Unacceptable Specimens:
◦ Grossly hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
◦ Specimens in anticoagulant tubes.
4. REAGENTS AND EQUIPMENT
◦ Anti-HBe ELISA Kit (Manufacturer: e.g., Abbott, Roche, etc.)
◦ Micropipettes (10-1000 µL range)
◦ Multichannel pipette (optional)
◦ Incubator set at 37°C
◦ Microplate reader with 450 nm filter
◦ Plate washer or washing bottles
◦ Timer
◦ Vortex mixer
◦ Personal protective equipment (PPE)
5. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Run positive and negative controls provided with the assay
kit with each batch of samples analyzed.
◦ Use both low and high-concentration controls at the start of
each assay run and review the results for conformance to
expected values.
◦ Deviation outside of established quality control range must
be investigated, and assays repeated as necessary.
6. PROCEDURE
Pre-analysis:
◦ Verify that assay reagents are within expiration date.
◦ Equilibrate all reagents and samples to room temperature
before use.
◦ Label all required microplates and sample tubes clearly.
Assay Procedure:
1. Preparation of reagents:
▪ Thaw frozen reagents and controls at room
temperature.
▪ Dilute wash buffer concentrate to final required volume
with deionized or distilled water.
2. Sample Addition:
▪ Pipette 100 µL of each serum specimen, control, and
calibrator into designated wells of the microplate.
▪ Add 100 µL of the provided conjugate reagent to each
well.
▪ Mix the plate gently for 5 seconds and cover with
adhesive plate sealers.
3. Incubation:
▪ Incubate the plate at 37°C for 60 minutes.
4. Washing:
▪ Aspirate or decant the contents of the well and wash
the plate 6 times with 350 µL of diluted wash buffer per
well.
▪ After the final wash, gently tap the plate on absorbent
paper to remove residual liquid.
5. Substrate Addition:
▪ Add 100 µL of the tetra-methyl benzidine (TMB)
substrate to each well.
▪ Incubate the plate in the dark at room temperature for
15-30 minutes, or as recommended by the kit
manufacturer.
6. Stopping Reaction:
▪ Stop the enzymatic reaction by adding 100 µL of stop
solution (usually 1N H2SO4) to each well, ensuring the
same sequence and timing as the substrate addition.
7. Reading:
▪ Read the optical density of each well at 450 nm using
a microplate reader within 10 minutes of stopping the
reaction.
7. RESULT INTERPRETATION
◦ Calculate mean absorbance for each set of controls and
calibrators.
◦ Establish a cutoff value based on kit instructions.
◦ Determine the presence or absence of Anti-HBe in each
patient sample by comparing the absorbance values with
the cutoff value.
◦ Record results as positive or negative for Anti-HBe.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ Results must be reviewed and verified by a qualified
laboratory technologist.
◦ Enter the verified test results into the Laboratory Information
System (LIS) for further clinical correlation and reporting.
9. REFERENCE INTERVALS
◦ A negative result (no detectable Anti-HBe): Interpret
indicative of an early phase of infection or immune
tolerance.
◦ A positive result: Indicative of an active or resolving infection
wherein HBeAg has been cleared by the immune response.
10. LIMITATIONS
◦ Refer to the kit instructions for methodological limitations
and interferences that may impact the assay results.

By following these steps meticulously, the analysis of Hepatitis B
Virus E Antibody (Anti-HBe) in serum samples will be performed to
the highest standard, ensuring reliable and accurate results.
