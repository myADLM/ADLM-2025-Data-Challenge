Hepatitis B Virus E Antigen and Hepatitis B Virus E Antibody, Serum:
Analytical Phase Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for the accurate and efficient analysis of
Hepatitis B Virus E Antigen (HBeAg) and Hepatitis B Virus E Antibody
(HBeAb) in serum specimens. This protocol ensures reproducibility,
reliability, and standardization of test results.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory staff are responsible for following the
procedures outlined in this SOP for analyzing and reporting
Hepatitis B Virus E Antigen and E Antibody results.
• Laboratory supervisors are responsible for ensuring all staff are
adequately trained and procedures are followed correctly.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
2.1 Specimen Type:
• Preferred: Serum collected in SST (serum separator tube)
• Acceptable: Serum in regular red-top tubes
2.2 Specimen Stability:
• Room temperature (20-25°C): 3 hours
• Refrigerated (2-8°C): 7 days
• Frozen (< -20°C): 1 month
2.3 Unacceptable Specimens:
• Plasma or whole blood
• Specimens that are hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric
• Specimens kept at room temperature for more than 3 hours
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
3.1 Equipment:
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Microplate reader or chemiluminescence instrument
• Timer
3.2 Reagents:
• HBeAg and HBeAb assay kits (specific manufacturer guidelines
should be followed)
• Controls (positive and negative)
• Calibrators
3.3 Supplies:
• SST or red-top tubes
• Disposable gloves
• Laboratory coat
• Biohazard waste containers
1. PROCEDURE
4.1 Specimen Preparation:
• Allow serum specimens to clot for at least 30 minutes before
centrifugation.
• Centrifuge the samples at 1500-2000 x g for 10 minutes to
separate serum.
• Carefully transfer the serum to a labeled aliquot tube.
4.2 Assay Procedure:
• Follow the specific manufacturer's instructions for the HBeAg and
HBeAb assay kits:
1. Bring all reagents, controls, and calibrators to room
temperature before use.
2. Pipette the required volume of serum samples, controls, and
calibrators into the designated wells of the assay plate.
3. Add the pre-diluted conjugate to each well.
4. Incubate the plate at 37°C for the specified time (usually 30-60
minutes).
5. Wash the wells with the wash buffer as per the kit instructions.
6. Add the substrate solution to each well and incubate at room
temperature in the dark for the specified time.
7. Add the stop solution to each well to stop the reaction.
8. Read the optical density (OD) of each well using the microplate
reader at the specified wavelength.
4.3 Quality Control:
• Run positive and negative controls with each batch of samples.
• Use calibrators to create a standard curve if required by the
assay.
• Ensure all controls and calibrators are within the manufacturer's
recommended ranges before reporting patient results.
• Document all control and calibrator results in the designated log.
4.4 Interpretation of Results:
• Compare the OD values of the sample wells to those of the
controls and calibrators.
• Based on the assay's cut-off values provided by the manufacturer,
determine whether the sample is positive or negative for HBeAg
and HBeAb.
• Follow the manufacturer's guidelines for any ambiguous or
borderline results.
4.5 Reporting:
• Report results according to laboratory guidelines in the LIS
(Laboratory Information System).
• Ensure that all critical values are communicated to the
appropriate healthcare provider immediately, following the SOP
for critical results reporting.
• Include a comment for any results that require further action or
follow-up testing.
1. SAMPLE INTEGRITY:
• If any issue is observed with sample integrity (e.g., hemolysis,
turbidity), document the issue, and consider repeating the test or
requesting a new sample.
• Use best judgment when interpreting compromised samples, and
consult a supervisor if needed.
1. REFERENCES:
Refer to the specific manufacturer's product insert for the HBeAg and
HBeAb assay used.
• [Manufacturer’s Name] HBeAg Assay Manual
• [Manufacturer’s Name] HBeAb Assay Manual
1. DOCUMENTATION:
• Maintain logs for temperature records, control and calibrator
results, and any equipment maintenance.
• Document all steps meticulously, ensuring traceability and
reproducibility of results.
Ensure all laboratories and personnel adhere to these guidelines for
the reliable and valid testing of Hepatitis B Virus E Antigen and E
Antibody in serum specimens.
