Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for HEPATITIS B VIRUS E
ANTIGEN (HBeAg) Testing, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
This SOP details the procedures and protocols for the analytical
phase of measuring Hepatitis B Virus e Antigen (HBeAg) levels in
serum samples.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory personnel will be responsible for
performing the HBeAg assay.
• Supervisors ensure the SOP is followed diligently and results are
validated before reporting.
1. DEFINITION
Hepatitis B Virus e Antigen (HBeAg) is a marker of active Hepatitis B
virus replication and high infectivity. Detection and measurement of
HBeAg are crucial for the diagnosis, management, and treatment
monitoring of Hepatitis B infection.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen:
• Preferred: Serum.
• Collection: Collect 5-10 mL of venous blood using standard
phlebotomy techniques into a serum separator tube (SST).
• Stability: Serum can be separated and stored at 2-8°C for up to
72 hours or frozen at -20°C for extended storage.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Insufficient volume.
• Gross hemolysis.
• Lipemic or icteric samples.
• Specimens collected in anticoagulant tubes (e.g., EDTA, heparin).
• Specimens received after the stability period.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• HBeAg detection kit (as per manufacturer's instructions, e.g.,
EIAs, CLIAs).
• Calibrators and controls: Negative and positive controls provided
by the kit.
• Automated immunoassay analyzer (e.g., ELISA reader,
chemiluminescence analyzer).
• Pipettes and tips (calibrated).
• Micro-tubes or appropriate vials.
• Deionized water.
• Laboratory timer.
• Quality control (QC) materials.
1. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
• Ensure all reagents and specimens are at room temperature.
• Validate the expiry dates of reagents and kits before use.
Assay Procedure (EIA Method):
1. Pipette 100 μL of serum, calibrators, and controls into
designated wells of the assay plate.
2. Add 50 μL of enzyme conjugate to each well.
3. Incubate the plate at 37°C for 60 minutes.
4. Wash the plate 5 times with 300 μL wash buffer.
5. Add 100 μL of substrate solution to each well.
6. Incubate the plate at room temperature (18-25°C) for 10-15
minutes away from direct light.
7. Add 100 μL of stop solution to each well.
8. Read the absorbance at 450 nm within 10 minutes using an
ELISA reader.
Note: Follow the manufacturer's instructions meticulously if using a
CLI analyzer or other detection methods.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run negative and positive controls with each batch of tests.
• QC results must fall within the specified range provided by the
manufacturer.
• Investigate any deviations and repeat the assay if necessary
before reporting patient results.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Measure and record optical density (OD) values from the ELISA
reader.
• Use the calibration curve to determine the concentration of
HBeAg in each sample.
• Record the results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS) for
validation and verification by the technologist.
Interpretation:
• Positive: Presence of HBeAg indicative of active replication.
• Negative: Absence of HBeAg suggesting low or inactive
replication. (Note: Interpretation guidance may be provided by the
manufacturer.)
Reference Intervals:
• Specific reference intervals based on the kit's manufacturer insert
should be adhered to.
1. RESULT VALIDATION
• All test results must be reviewed and validated by the
technologist.
• Any critical or unexpected results should be discussed with a
supervisor prior to releasing the results.
1. DOCUMENTATION
• Maintain records of all calibration data, quality control runs, and
test results.
• Document any deviations and corrective actions taken.
