Hepatitis B Virus Genotyping SOP
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for performing Hepatitis B Virus (HBV)
genotyping on patient specimens in order to identify the specific
subtype of HBV, which can influence prognosis and treatment
strategies.
Responsibility:
All trained laboratory personnel are responsible for performing and
documenting the HBV genotyping according to this procedure.
Supervisors are responsible for overseeing the process, ensuring
adherence to protocols, and troubleshooting any issues that arise.
2. DEFINITIONS
HBV Genotyping: The process of determining the genetic sequence
of the hepatitis B virus strain in a patient sample to identify its specific
genotype.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimens: - Preferred: Serum or plasma collected in EDTA or SST
(Serum Separator Tube) - Volume: Minimum of 1 mL - Stability: -
Room temperature: 24 hours - Refrigerated (2-8°C): 7 days - Frozen
(-20°C or lower): Indefinite
Unacceptable Specimens: - Hemolyzed or lipemic samples -
Specimens collected in anticoagulants other than EDTA - Samples
with insufficient volume
4. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
Equipment: - PCR Thermocycler - Gel electrophoresis apparatus -
UV transilluminator - Microcentrifuge - Automated DNA extraction
system
Reagents: - HBV genotyping PCR Kit (specific for HBV genotyping) -
Nuclease-free water - Ethanol (70%) - Loading dye - DNA ladder -
Agarose - Ethidium bromide or safe alternative
5. PROCEDURE
Sample Preparation: 1. Thaw serum/plasma samples if stored
frozen. 2. Centrifuge samples at 2000 x g for 10 minutes to remove
any remaining particulate matter. 3. Aliquot 200 µL of prepared
sample into a labeled microcentrifuge tube.
DNA Extraction: 1. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for the
automated DNA extraction system. 2. Elute the extracted DNA in a
final volume of 50 µL nuclease-free water. 3. Measure DNA
concentration using a spectrophotometer.
PCR Amplification: 1. Prepare the PCR master mix according to the
HBV genotyping kit instructions. 2. Add sample DNA to the PCR mix.
3. Load the PCR tubes into the thermocycler and run the appropriate
amplification program as specified by the kit.
Gel Electrophoresis: 1. Prepare a 2% agarose gel with ethidium
bromide or a safe alternative. 2. Load PCR products and DNA ladder
into the gel wells. 3. Run the gel at 100V for 30-45 minutes. 4.
Visualize bands under UV light using a transilluminator.
Interpretation of Results: 1. Compare the bands from the PCR
products to the DNA ladder to determine the sizes of the PCR
fragments. 2. Use the provided genotyping interpretation guide to
identify the HBV genotype based on the specific band pattern
observed.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
Internal Control: - Include a positive control (known HBV DNA) and
a negative control (nuclease-free water) in each run. - Ensure
controls produce expected results; if not, troubleshoot and repeat the
run.
External Quality Control: - Participate in external proficiency testing
programs as available. - Record and review the results from external
proficiency tests to ensure consistent accuracy of genotyping
processes.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
- Enter the HBV genotype into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
- Validate the results by a qualified technologist before releasing.
- For critical genotypes associated with specific clinical actions, notify the ordering physician directly.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
- This method may not differentiate all possible HBV subtypes.
- Sample quality can impact the accuracy of genotyping; ensure proper sample collection and handling.
