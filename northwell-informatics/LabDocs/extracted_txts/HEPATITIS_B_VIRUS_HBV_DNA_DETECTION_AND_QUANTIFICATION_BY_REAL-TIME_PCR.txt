Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Hepatitis B
Virus (HBV) DNA Detection and Quantification by Real-
Time PCR
1. PURPOSE
To outline the protocol for the detection and quantification of Hepatitis
B virus (HBV) DNA using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
in a CLIA-certified laboratory. This SOP ensures consistent, accurate,
and reliable results while maintaining laboratory safety and quality
standards.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel trained in real-time
PCR techniques for the detection and quantification of HBV DNA. It
encompasses the preparation of samples, reagents, and equipment,
as well as the PCR process and data analysis.
3. RESPONSIBILITIES
• Laboratory Technologists: Trained and authorized personnel
are responsible for performing the assay and maintaining
accurate records.
• Supervisors/Managers: Ensure that proper training is provided
to the staff, the SOP is followed correctly, and necessary
corrective actions are taken.
• Quality Control Personnel: Monitor the quality control
processes, verify the results, and report any inconsistencies.
4. PRINCIPLE
Real-time PCR is utilized to detect and quantify HBV DNA in a
patient's sample. The technique involves the amplification of HBV
DNA and the use of fluorescent probes to measure the amount of
virus present in the sample in real-time.
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Plasma or serum.
• Collection Tubes: EDTA (lavender top) or serum separator tubes
(SST).
• Volume: Preferred minimum volume is 1 mL.
• Storage: Specimens should be stored at -20°C or lower if not
tested immediately.
• Unacceptable Conditions: Grossly hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric
specimens. Specimens stored at an inappropriate temperature
without stabilization.
6. REAGENTS, SUPPLIES, AND EQUIPMENT
• Reagents:
◦ HBV DNA extraction kit.
◦ RT-PCR master mix.
◦ HBV-specific primers and probes.
◦ Nuclease-free water.
◦ Quantitative standards for HBV DNA.
• Supplies:
◦ Micropipettes and tips.
◦ PCR plates or tubes.
◦ Vortex mixer.
◦ Centrifuge.
• Equipment:
◦ Real-time PCR instrument (e.g., ABI 7500 or Roche
LightCycler).
◦ Laminar flow hood.
◦ Refrigerators and freezers (-20°C and -80°C).
7. PROCEDURE
7.1. Sample Preparation
1. Thaw the Samples: Thaw frozen plasma/serum samples at
room temperature.
2. Centrifuge: Centrifuge at 2000 x g for 10 minutes to remove
any particulate matter.
3. Aliquoting: Transfer 500 µL of supernatant into a clean
microcentrifuge tube.
4. Storage: Keep the aliquoted samples on ice or at 4°C until
ready for nucleic acid extraction.
7.2. Nucleic Acid Extraction
1. Perform Extraction: Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for
the HBV DNA extraction kit to extract viral DNA from the
aliquoted samples.
2. Elution: Elute the DNA in a final volume of 50 µL of nuclease-
free water or elution buffer.
3. Storage: Store the extracted DNA at -20°C if not used
immediately.
7.3. PCR Setup
1. Thaw Reagents: Thaw the RT-PCR master mix, primers, and
probes on ice. Keep them on ice throughout the setup process.
2. Prepare Master Mix:
◦ Mix the components as specified by the manufacturer’s
protocol.
◦ Include all components except the DNA template.
3. Dispense Master Mix:
◦ Aliquot 20 µL of the master mix into each well of a PCR
plate or tube.
4. Add DNA Template:
◦ Add 5 µL of the extracted DNA to each well.
◦ Include no-template control (NTC) and positive control in
each run.
5. Seal the Plate: Seal the PCR plate with adhesive film to
prevent evaporation.
7.4. Real-Time PCR Conditions
1. Program the PCR Instrument:
◦ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 10 minutes.
◦ Denaturation: 95°C for 15 seconds.
◦ Annealing/Extension: 60°C for 1 minute.
◦ Number of cycles: 45 cycles.
2. Run the PCR: Place the plate/tubes in the real-time PCR
instrument and initiate the run according to the programmed
cycling conditions.
7.5. Data Analysis
1. Examine Amplification Plot: Ensure that the NTC does not
exhibit any amplification.
2. Calculate Quantification: Use the standard curve generated
from the quantitative standards to determine the viral load in the
samples.
3. Verify Results: Verify and review the results to ensure
accuracy.
4. Interpret Data: Interpret the HBV DNA quantification in IU/mL
based on the amplification data.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
• Positive Control: Include in each run to ensure the PCR reaction
is functioning correctly.
• Negative Control (NTC): Include in each run to monitor for
contamination. There should be no amplification in the NTC.
• Standard Curve: Use a standard curve with known
concentrations of HBV DNA to quantify the viral load in the patient
samples.
• Internal Controls: Include internal controls as applicable to
monitor the adequacy of the amplification process.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Review and Verify: Ensure results are consistent and correct.
2. Report Units: Report HBV DNA results in IU/mL.
3. Critical Limits: Immediately notify the supervisor if the viral
load exceeds a critical threshold defined in the laboratory’s
policy.
10. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• HBV DNA viral load ranges typically from undetectable to above
10^8 IU/mL. Define specific reporting thresholds as per clinical
guidelines.
11. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Cross Reactions: Potential cross-contamination or inhibitor
presence affecting the accuracy.
• Sensitivity and Specificity: Limited by the sensitivity of the assay
and primer-probe set.
• Sample Integrity: High quality and correctly stored samples are
critical for accurate results.
