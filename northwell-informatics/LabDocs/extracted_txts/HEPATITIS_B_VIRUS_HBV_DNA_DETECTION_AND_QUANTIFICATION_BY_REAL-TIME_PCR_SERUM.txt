STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP) FOR HEPATITIS B
VIRUS (HBV) DNA DETECTION AND QUANTIFICATION BY REAL-
TIME PCR, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
This protocol is designed to detect and quantify Human Hepatitis B
Virus (HBV) DNA present in serum specimens using Real-Time
Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR). This procedure helps in the
diagnosis, management, and monitoring of patients with HBV
infection.
Responsibility:
Designated staff will perform HBV DNA detection and quantification
according to this SOP. It is the responsibility of all staff to ensure the
procedure is implemented correctly and to report any issues promptly
to the supervisor.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Real-Time PCR Instrument (e.g., Roche LightCycler, ABI 7500)
• Microcentrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Pipettes and tips with aerosol barriers
• PCR workstation or biosafety cabinet
Reagents:
• HBV DNA Extraction Kit (e.g., Qiagen, Roche)
• HBV Real-Time PCR Master Mix
• Primers and Probes specific for HBV
• Positive Control (HBV DNA)
• Negative Control (Nuclease-free water)
Supplies:
• 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes
• Real-Time PCR plates or tubes
• Adhesive film (if using PCR plates)
• Nitrile gloves
• Lab coat
• Disposable pipette tips
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Preferred/Acceptable:
• 5-10 mL serum collected in SST (Serum Separator Tubes)
• Serum should be separated from clot within 6 hours of collection
• Store at 2-8°C for up to 72 hours, or freeze at -20°C or lower for
longer storage
Unacceptable:
• Specimens without proper labeling
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples
• Specimens without date of collection
1. PROCEDURE
A) Sample Preparation:
1. Thaw frozen serum samples at room temperature.
2. Vortex each sample for 5 seconds and briefly centrifuge to
collect the contents at the bottom of the tube.
3. Prepare negative and positive controls alongside patient
samples.
B) DNA Extraction:
1. Follow the manufacturer’s protocol for the HBV DNA Extraction
Kit.
2. Elute the DNA in a final volume of 50 µL elution buffer.
3. Store extracted DNA at -20°C if not used immediately.
C) PCR Setup:
1. In a PCR workstation, prepare the PCR Master Mix according
to the following table:
◦ 5 µL of 10x PCR Buffer
◦ 1 µL of HBV-specific forward primer (10 µM)
◦ 1 µL of HBV-specific reverse primer (10 µM)
◦ 1 µL of HBV-specific probe (10 µM)
◦ 1 µL of dNTP mix (10 mM each)
◦ 0.5 µL of Taq DNA polymerase (5 U/µL)
◦ Nuclease-free water to a final volume of 44 µL (or prepared
in bulk as needed)
2. Aliquot 45 µL of the Master Mix into each Real-Time PCR tube
or well.
3. Add 5 µL of extracted DNA to each tube/well. For controls, add
5 µL of positive or negative control.
4. Cap the tubes tightly or seal the plate with adhesive film.
D) Real-Time PCR Cycling Conditions:
1. Load the PCR tubes or plate into the Real-Time PCR
instrument.
2. Set the PCR program as follows:
• Initial denaturation at 95°C for 10 minutes
• 45 cycles of:
◦ Denaturation at 95°C for 15 seconds
◦ Annealing at 60°C for 30 seconds
◦ Extension at 72°C for 30 seconds
1. Set the detection channel to the appropriate fluorophore for the
HBV probe.
E) Data Analysis:
1. Export the data after the PCR run is complete.
2. Interpret the results based on the Ct (cycle threshold) values:
◦ Positive: Ct < 35
◦ Indeterminate: Ct 35-40 (repeat testing recommended)
◦ Negative: Ct > 40
3. Quantify the HBV DNA using a standard curve if applicable.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run positive and negative controls with each set of samples to
ensure the reliability of results.
• Repeat any specimens with conflicting results or Ct values in the
indeterminate range.
• Record all results, including control outcomes, in the appropriate
log.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Positive results indicating HBV DNA presence will be reported as
“Positive for HBV DNA” along with the viral load if quantification
was performed.
• Negative results indicating no detectable HBV DNA will be
reported as “Negative for HBV DNA.”
• Indeterminate results will be reported with a note recommending
repeat testing.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Negative: No detectable HBV DNA
• Positive: Detectable HBV DNA, quantified in IU/mL
1. LIMITATIONS
• False negatives may occur due to sample degradation, inhibitors,
or low viral load below detection threshold.
• False positives may occur due to contamination or non-specific
amplification.
