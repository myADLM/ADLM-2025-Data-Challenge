HEPATITIS B VIRUS PAST EXPOSURE PANEL, SERUM
1. PURPOSE: To outline the standardized procedure for processing
and analyzing serum specimens for the Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) Past
Exposure Panel.
2. SCOPE: This procedure applies to the laboratory personnel
responsible for performing the Hepatitis B Virus Past Exposure Panel
testing in the laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY: Laboratory technologists and designated
personnel are responsible for following this protocol meticulously.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS:
Specimen Type:
• Serum
Specimen Collection:
• Preferred: 5-10 mL of blood collected in a serum separator tube
(SST)
• After collection, allow blood to clot at room temperature for 30
minutes but not more than 2 hours.
• Centrifuge the SST at 1300-1800 RCF for 10-15 minutes to
separate the serum from the clot as soon as possible post-
collection.
Storage and Stability:
• Serum can be stored at 2-8°C for up to 7 days.
• For longer storage, freeze serum at -20°C or lower. Avoid
repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
Unacceptable Specimen Conditions:
• Specimens with gross hemolysis or lipemia
• Specimens not properly labeled or without accompanying
documentation
• Specimens subjected to improper storage conditions
5. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES:
• ELISA kits specific to Hepatitis B markers (e.g., HBsAg, anti-HBs,
anti-HBc)
• Reagent grade water
• Controls (Positive and Negative Controls)
• Calibrators
• Micropipettes and pipette tips
• Plate readers and washers as specified by the assay kit
6. PROCEDURE:
A) Initial Workflow:
1. Verify and record specimen details as per laboratory protocols.
2. Ensure all reagents and controls are brought to room
temperature before starting the assay.
3. Prepare the ELISA plate according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
B) ELISA Assay Procedure:
1. Add calibrators, controls, and patient serum samples to their
respective wells.
2. Pipette the required volume of conjugate reagent into each well.
3. Cover the plate and incubate at the specified temperature and
duration as outlined in the kit instructions.
4. Wash each well multiple times with the washing buffer to
remove unbound materials.
5. Add the substrate solution into each well and incubate the plate
for the recommended time.
6. Add the stop solution to terminate the reaction.
C) Plate Reading:
1. Read the absorbance of each well at the appropriate
wavelength (specified in the kit instructions) using a microplate
reader.
2. Record the absorbance values and compare to the control and
calibrator values to ensure assay performance.
D) Quality Control:
1. Quality control reagents must be run with each assay to
validate the test runs.
2. If control results do not meet the established criteria, the run
must be considered invalid, and the assay must be repeated.
E) Interpretation of Results:
1. Analyze the result data to determine if the sample is positive or
negative for each marker in the HBV panel.
2. Compare patient results against the cutoff values provided for
each marker.
3. For invalid runs, review the procedure to identify any issues,
resolve the problem, and repeat the assay ensuring proper
documentation.
7. REPORTING RESULTS:
• Results should be entered and verified in the Laboratory
Information System (LIS) according to laboratory guidelines.
• Ensure that results are communicated in a timely manner and that
any critical results are promptly reported to the appropriate
healthcare providers.
8. ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS:
• Follow all manufacturer’s recommendations and procedures
detailed in the assay kit inserts.
• Use appropriate PPE and follow biosafety guidelines to ensure
safe handling of hazardous materials.
• Maintain thorough and accurate documentation throughout the
testing process to ensure traceability and accountability.
9. REFERENCES:
• Manufacturer’s instructions for ELISA kit specific to HBV markers.
• Laboratory’s QC, safety, and procedural manuals.
Note: This SOP should be reviewed regularly and updated as
necessary to incorporate new techniques, guidelines, or changes in
the method.
