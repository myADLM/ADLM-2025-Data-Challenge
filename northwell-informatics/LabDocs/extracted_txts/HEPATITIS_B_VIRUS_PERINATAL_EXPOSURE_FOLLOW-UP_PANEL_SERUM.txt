Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Hepatitis B Virus (HBV)
Perinatal Exposure Follow-Up Panel, Serum
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to outline the steps to be
followed during the analytical phase of generating results for
the Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) Perinatal Exposure Follow-Up
Panel using serum specimens. This ensures the accuracy and
reliability of test results and compliance with all regulatory
standards.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all designated laboratory personnel to
perform and document the testing procedures. Supervisors are
responsible for ensuring staff adherence to these procedures
and addressing any issues or deviations.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
◦ Preferred Specimen: Serum collected via venipuncture in a
serum separator tube (SST).
◦ Volume: A minimum of 2 mL of serum.
◦ Handling: Serum should be separated from cells within 2
hours of collection.
◦ Storage: Serum specimens should be refrigerated at 2-8°C
and tested within 7 days of collection or frozen at -20°C for
longer storage up to 30 days.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
◦ HBV diagnostic kit (with Hepatitis B Surface Antigen
(HBsAg), Hepatitis B Surface Antibody (Anti-HBs), and
Hepatitis B Core Antibody (Anti-HBc) reagents)
◦ Calibrators and Controls
◦ Automated immunoassay analyzer
◦ Microplates, pipettes, and tips
◦ Incubator set to 37°C
◦ Centrifuge
◦ Personal protective equipment (PPE)
5. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Internal Quality Control:
▪ Run controls at both high and low levels for each analyte
in the panel (HBsAg, Anti-HBs, Anti-HBc) with every
batch of specimens.
▪ Acceptable control ranges must be established and
adhered to. If controls fall outside of predetermined
ranges, troubleshoot and repeat the assay.
▪ Document all quality control results and any corrective
actions taken.
◦ External Quality Assurance:
▪ Participate in proficiency testing programs and inter-
laboratory comparison studies.
6. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation: - Allow all reagents and samples to reach room
temperature before use. - Verify that sufficient reagents,
calibrators, and controls are available and within their expiration
dates. - Calibrate the analyzer according to the manufacturer’s
instructions if required.
B. Sample and Reagent Loading: - Label all samples
appropriately. - Load serum samples, calibrators, and controls
onto the analyzer. - Prepare the reagent trays with the
necessary volume for each test run.
C. Assay Execution: - Program the analyzer with the
appropriate assay protocol for the HBV panel. - Ensure that
proper incubation times and temperatures are maintained. -
Follow wash procedures as per the analyzer’s protocol between
steps to minimize cross-contamination.
D. Result Interpretation: - HBsAg: A positive result indicates
current infection. - Anti-HBs: A positive result indicates immunity
either through vaccination or recovery from an infection. - Anti-
HBc: A positive result suggests past or ongoing infection.
E. Result Documentation and Verification: - Record all raw
data and observed results. - Results must be reviewed and
verified by a technologist. - Compare each result against the
established reference ranges.
7. RESULT REPORTING
◦ Verified results are entered into the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
◦ Results are reported as per site-specific guidelines and
include interpretation notes.
◦ Ensure urgent or critical results are communicated
immediately to the requesting clinician or appropriate
healthcare provider.
8. REFERENCE INTERVALS
◦ HBsAg: Negative
◦ Anti-HBs: ≥10 mIU/mL (indicative of immunity)
◦ Anti-HBc: Negative
9. TROUBLESHOOTING
◦ If the quality control fails, do not report patient results. Re-
troubleshoot and repeat the control test.
◦ Follow instrument-specific troubleshooting guides for any
errors or unexpected results.
◦ Document all actions taken during troubleshooting.
10. LIMITATIONS
◦ Hemolyzed, lipemic, and icteric samples can affect test
results and should be avoided.
◦ Interference might occur due to heterophile antibodies,
sample handling issues, or reagent contamination.
11. SAFETY
◦ Follow universal precautions when handling specimens and
reagents.
◦ Wear appropriate PPE including gloves, lab coat, and eye
protection.
