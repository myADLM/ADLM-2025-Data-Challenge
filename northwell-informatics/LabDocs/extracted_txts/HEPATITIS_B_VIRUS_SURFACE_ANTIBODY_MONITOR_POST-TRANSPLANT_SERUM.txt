Standard Operating Procedure
Title: Protocol for Hepatitis B Virus Surface Antibody Monitor, Post-
Transplant, Serum
1. PURPOSE:
To outline the procedures for the analysis and reporting of Hepatitis B
Virus (HBV) Surface Antibody (Anti-HBs) levels in serum samples
from post-transplant patients to ensure accurate and reliable results.
2. SCOPE:
This SOP applies to all personnel involved in the analysis of HBV
Surface Antibody Monitor, Post-Transplant, Serum in the laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY:
It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory personnel to follow
the protocol as outlined and ensure the quality and accuracy of the
test results.
4. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS:
• Automated Immunoassay Analyzer
• HBV Surface Antibody Reagent Kit (specific to analyzer)
• Quality Control Materials (positive and negative controls)
• Calibrators
• Humidity and temperature-controlled centrifuge
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
• Laboratory Information System (LIS)
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS:
• Serum specimens collected in accordance with standard
phlebotomy procedures.
• Specimens must be labeled clearly with patient identification and
collection time.
• Specimens should be centrifuged promptly, and serum separated
and stored at 2-8°C if not analyzed immediately. For long-term
storage, specimens should be frozen at -20°C or lower.
6. PROCEDURE:
A. Pre-Analytical Phase:
1. Verify that specimens have been properly collected, labeled,
and stored.
2. Centrifuge the serum specimens at 1500-2000 x g for 10
minutes.
3. Inspect serum for hemolysis or lipemia; if present, document
and notify supervisor.
B. Analytical Phase:
1. Preparation:
◦ Ensure the immunoassay analyzer is powered on and has
passed self-diagnostics.
◦ Load the HBV Surface Antibody Reagent Kit, including
necessary reagents, calibrators, and quality control
materials.
◦ Ensure that reagent and control materials are within
expiration dates and stored appropriately.
2. Calibration:
◦ Calibrate the analyzer using the calibrators provided with
the reagent kit.
◦ Perform the calibration procedure as per manufacturer’s
instructions.
◦ Document the calibration details in the calibration log.
3. Quality Control:
◦ Conduct quality control tests with each batch using both
positive and negative controls.
◦ Ensure quality control results fall within manufacturer-
provided ranges.
◦ Document quality control results and take corrective action if
results fall outside acceptable ranges.
4. Sample Analysis:
◦ Load prepared serum specimens onto the analyzer.
◦ Initiate the test sequence as per the analyzer’s operating
procedure.
◦ Monitor the analysis process ensuring the analyzer runs
smoothly without any errors or interruptions.
7. POST-ANALYTICAL PHASE:
A. Data Analysis:
1. Review generated data for quality and consistency.
2. Validate and verify results in the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
3. Document any discrepancies and follow the laboratory’s
protocol for investigating and resolving such issues.
B. Reporting Results:
1. Report results in the LIS and ensure they are transmitted to
relevant medical records.
2. Include interpretation of results based on reference intervals
provided by the kit manufacturer and clinical guidelines.
3. For critical values, immediately notify the ordering physician
and document the communication.
8. QUALITY ASSURANCE:
1. Participate in external proficiency testing for HBV Surface
Antibody assays as available.
2. Regularly review and update this protocol to include the latest
standards and manufacturer updates.
3. Record and monitor equipment maintenance and calibration
schedules.
9. SAFETY AND WASTE DISPOSAL:
1. Follow all safety protocols for handling potentially infectious
materials.
2. Dispose of all biohazard waste according to local regulations
and laboratory guidelines.
