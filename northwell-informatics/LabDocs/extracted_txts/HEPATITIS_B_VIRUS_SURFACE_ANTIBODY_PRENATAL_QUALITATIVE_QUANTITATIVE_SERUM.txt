Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for Generating
Results for Hepatitis B Virus Surface Antibody
(Prenatal, Qualitative/Quantitative, Serum)
1. PURPOSE
To define the procedures for the qualitative and quantitative testing of
Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) surface antibody in serum samples for
prenatal patients, ensuring results are accurate, timely, and compliant
with regulatory standards.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
• Laboratory Technologists are responsible for performing the HBV
surface antibody assays according to this SOP.
• Supervisors are responsible for review, troubleshooting, and
ensuring adherence to all SOPs.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Collection:
• Preferred/acceptable: 5 mL of patient serum collected in SST
(serum separator tube).
• Unacceptable: Hemolyzed, lipemic, or contaminated specimens.
Specimens in incorrect tubes (e.g., EDTA, heparin).
Specimen Transport and Storage:
• Serum specimens should be transported to the laboratory within 2
hours of collection.
• If not analyzed immediately, store serum at 2-8°C for up to 72
hours; for longer storage, serum should be frozen at -20°C or
lower.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Automated Chemiluminescent Immunoassay Analyzer (e.g.,
Roche Elecsys, Abbott Architect)
• HBV Surface Antibody Testing Kits compatible with the analyzer
• Quality control materials (positive and negative controls)
• Calibrators
• Pipettes and tips
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
5. PROCEDURE
Calibration and Quality Control:
1. Ensure that calibrators and controls are thawed, if frozen, and
brought to room temperature before use.
2. Calibrate the analyzer using calibrators provided with the kit.
Follow the manufacturer's instructions for calibration.
3. Run positive and negative controls at the beginning of each
shift, and whenever a new lot of reagents is introduced.
◦ Document control results in the Quality Control Log. If
controls fall outside acceptable limits, troubleshoot and run
controls again. Do not proceed with patient testing until
controls are within range.
Specimen Processing:
1. Centrifuge the SST tube for 10 minutes at 1500-2000g to
separate serum from clots and cellular components.
2. Transfer the serum to a clean, labeled secondary tube if
required.
3. Load the serum samples onto the automated analyzer
according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Automated Analysis:
1. Select the HBV surface antibody assay from the analyzer's
menu.
2. Ensure reagents, including conjugate and substrate, are
correctly loaded into the analyzer.
3. Program the analyzer with the patient’s specimen information
(e.g., ID, test requested).
4. Initiate the run and monitor the analyzer for any error messages
or flags.
Result Interpretation:
1. Qualitative Results:
◦ Reactive: Presence of HBV surface antibodies in the serum.
◦ Non-Reactive: Absence of HBV surface antibodies in the
serum.
2. Quantitative Results:
◦ Results are displayed in mIU/mL.
◦ A result >10 mIU/mL typically indicates immunity.
6. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If calibration or QC fails, check reagents, calibrators, and analyzer
setup. Recalibrate if necessary.
• Consult the user manual for analyzer-specific error codes and
troubleshooting steps.
• If persistent problems occur, contact the analyzer's technical
support for assistance.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
• Qualitative results are reported as Reactive or Non-Reactive.
• Quantitative results are reported in mIU/mL.
• Verify and review results before releasing to the Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
• Critical Values: Notify the requesting clinician immediately if HBV
surface antibody status is reactive (especially if quantitative value
indicates loss of immunity in a previously vaccinated individual).
8. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform daily calibration and quality control procedures as
outlined above.
• External Proficiency Testing: Participate in external quality
assessment programs to compare performance with peer
laboratories.
• Documentation: Record all quality control and calibration activities
in the designated logs. Maintain records for regulatory
compliance.

• Manufacturer's assay kit insert and automated analyzer user
manual.
• Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines.
• Current clinical guidelines for Hepatitis B testing and
management.
10. REVIEW AND REVISION
• This SOP shall be reviewed annually and revised as necessary to
ensure compliance with new regulations, guidelines, and
improvements in laboratory practice.
