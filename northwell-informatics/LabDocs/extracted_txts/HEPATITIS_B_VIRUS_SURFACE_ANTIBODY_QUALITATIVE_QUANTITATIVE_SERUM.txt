Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Hepatitis B Virus
Surface Antibody (HBsAb), Qualitative/Quantitative,
Serum
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standard procedure for the accurate and timely analysis
of Hepatitis B Virus Surface Antibody (HBsAb) in serum samples,
ensuring reliable qualitative and quantitative results for clinical
diagnosis.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all personnel involved in the processing, testing,
and reporting of HBsAb results in the laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Laboratory Technologists/Technicians: Perform the analytical
procedures as described and document the results.
• Supervisors: Ensure that the procedures are followed correctly
and handle any deviations or issues that arise during testing.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred Specimen: Serum collected in SST (Serum Separator
Tube).
• Unacceptable Specimen: Hemolyzed, lipemic, or improperly
labeled specimens.
• Storage and Stability: Serum specimens are stable for 7 days at
2-8°C or up to 6 months at -20°C.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Equipment: Automated immunoassay analyzer (e.g., Roche
Elecsys, Abbott Architect).
• Reagents: Manufacturer-specific HBsAb reagent kits, calibrators,
and quality control (QC) materials.
• Supplies: Pipettes, sample cups, gloves, lab coat, and
appropriate laboratory labels.
6. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation
• Centrifuge the SST tube at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes to separate
the serum.
• Transfer the serum into a clean labeled sample cup.
• Ensure that samples reach room temperature prior to testing.
B. Calibration and Quality Control
• Run calibrators and quality control samples according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
• Document QC results in the appropriate logs.
• Calibration must meet the manufacturer's criteria before
proceeding with patient sample testing.
C. Analyzing Patient Samples
• Load patient samples into the automated immunoassay analyzer.
• Select the appropriate HBsAb assay program on the analyzer.
• Ensure all samples, controls, and reagents are correctly loaded
and positioned.
• Start the analysis.
D. Monitoring and Observing Analysis
• Monitor the analyzer for any error messages or alerts during the
run.
• Troubleshoot any immediate issues following the manufacturer's
guidelines and document actions taken.
7. INTERPRETATION AND REPORTING RESULTS
• Qualitative Results:
◦ Negative: No detectable HBsAb.
◦ Positive: Presence of HBsAb, indicating immunity or past
infection.
• Quantitative Results:
◦ The result is reported in mIU/mL.
◦ Refer to manufacturer or clinical guidelines for interpretative
thresholds (e.g., ≥ 10 mIU/mL considered immune).
• Results are automatically transmitted to the Laboratory
Information System (LIS) and must be reviewed and verified by
the technologist prior to reporting.
• Notify the ordering physician of any critical or significantly
abnormal results immediately according to lab protocol.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform daily QC with at least two levels of controls (low and
high).
• If controls are outside of acceptable limits, do not report patient
results until the issue is resolved.
• Document all actions taken in response to QC failures.
9. MAINTENANCE AND TROUBLESHOOTING
• Perform maintenance on the analyzer as specified by the
manufacturer.
• Keep a log of all maintenance and any issues encountered.
• Contact technical support for persistent or unresolved problems.
10. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's reagent kit insert.
• Laboratory Quality Control Manual.
• Relevant clinical guidelines for HBsAb testing.
11. REVIEW AND REVISION
• This SOP is reviewed annually or as needed based on updates to
equipment, reagents, or laboratory policies.
