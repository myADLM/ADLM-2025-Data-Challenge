Standard Operating Procedure
Title: Analytical Phase of Generating Results for Hepatitis B Virus
Surface Antibody Screen, Qualitative/Quantitative, Serum
1. PURPOSE: To ensure accurate, reliable, and reproducible results
for the detection and quantification of Hepatitis B Virus Surface
Antibody (anti-HBs) in serum samples, which helps in determining
immunity to Hepatitis B Virus (HBV).
2. RESPONSIBILITY: It is the responsibility of the designated
laboratory personnel to perform the analysis according to this SOP. It
is also their responsibility to ensure that all equipment is functioning
properly and that all reagents are within expiry dates before the start
of the analysis.
3. DEFINITION: Hepatitis B Virus Surface Antibody (anti-HBs)
Screen, Qualitative/Quantitative, Serum test is used to detect the
presence and measure the concentration of antibodies against the
surface antigen of the hepatitis B virus, indicating past infection or
successful vaccination.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES:
• Microplate Reader
• Plate washer (or manual washing supplies)
• Microcentrifuge, centrifuge tubes, and pipettes (single and
multichannel)
• Incubator
• Protective gloves, lab coat, and safety goggles
Reagents:
• Hepatitis B Virus Surface Antibody ELISA kits
• Serum Controls (positive and negative controls)
• Calibrators/Data Reduction Software
• Substrate (TMB-HRP)
• Washing buffer
• Stop solution
5. SAMPLE REQUIREMENTS:
Specimen Collection:
• Acceptable: 5 mL freshly drawn serum from venipuncture.
• Unacceptable: Hemolyzed, lipemic, or contaminated samples.
Specimen Storage:
• Specimens can be kept at 2-8°C for up to 7 days.
• For long-term storage, specimens can be frozen at -20°C or
lower. Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
6. PROCEDURE:
A) Preparation:
1. Ensure all reagents and samples are at room temperature
before starting the assay.
2. Prepare washing buffer as per the kit manufacturer's
instructions.
3. Label all necessary microplate wells for control, calibrators, and
samples.
4. Prepare the microplate reader with the appropriate settings for
reading the assay (typically at 450 nm with a wavelength
correction of 600-650 nm).
B) Sample and Reagent Addition:
1. Pipette the appropriate volume of controls, calibrators, and
samples (in duplicate) into the designated wells.
2. Add the specified amount of anti-HBs enzyme conjugate to
each well.
3. Incubate the plate at 37°C for the recommended time outlined
in the kit insert.
C) Washing:
1. After incubation, aspirate the contents of the wells and wash
the plate with the washing buffer 3-5 times to remove unbound
components.
2. Ensure that no residual liquid remains by blotting the plate on
absorbent paper.
D) Substrate Addition:
1. Add the specified amount of substrate solution to each well.
2. Incubate the plate in the dark at room temperature for the time
recommended by the kit insert, usually 10-15 minutes.
E) Stopping the Reaction:
1. Add the stop solution to each well to halt the enzymatic
reaction.
2. Mix gently by tapping the side of the plate.
F) Reading the Plate:
1. Read the absorbance of each well at 450 nm using the
microplate reader, with a reference wavelength of 620-650 nm if
available.
7. CALCULATION AND INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS:
1. Calculate the mean absorbance for each set of duplicate wells.
2. Construct a standard curve using the calibrators provided in the
kit and determine the concentration of anti-HBs in the samples.
3. Compare the sample absorbance readings to the cut-off value
specified by the kit to determine qualitative results (positive,
negative, or borderline).
4. For quantitative results, interpret the concentrations of anti-HBs
against the established reference ranges.
8. QUALITY CONTROL:
1. Run positive and negative controls with each batch of samples.
The results must be within the acceptance criteria before
reporting patient results.
2. Document and review all control results and calibrators with
every run. Deviations must be investigated and resolved.
9. REPORTING RESULTS:
• Qualitative: Report as Positive, Negative, or Borderline.
• Quantitative: Report in IU/L (International Units per Liter) along
with the qualitative interpretation.
10. REFERENCES: Refer to the manufacturer's instructions provided
with the Hepatitis B Virus Surface Antibody ELISA kits for detailed
procedures and additional information.
11. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
• Cross-reactivity with other antibodies may occur. Follow
manufacturer instructions cautiously.
• Improper sample handling or storage could lead to inaccurate
results.
