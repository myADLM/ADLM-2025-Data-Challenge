Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Analytical Phase of Generating
Results for Hepatitis B Virus Surface Antigen Confirmation, Prenatal,
Serum
1. PURPOSE:
To establish a standardized procedure for the confirmation of
Hepatitis B Virus Surface Antigen (HBsAg) in serum from prenatal
specimens, ensuring reliable and accurate results.
1. SCOPE:
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel responsible for
processing and analyzing prenatal serum specimens for HBsAg
confirmation in a CLIA-certified laboratory.
1. RESPONSIBILITY:
All designated laboratory personnel must adhere to this protocol to
ensure the accuracy and reliability of the HBsAg confirmation testing.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENT:
Specimen Type: Serum Preferred Collection Container: Serum
Separator Tube (SST) or Red-Top Tube Minimum Volume: 2mL of
serum
1. EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS:
ELISA Reader Micropipettes and disposable tips Calibrated
centrifuge Incubator (37°C) Magnetic stirrer with a bar Hepatitis
B Virus Surface Antigen (HBsAg) ELISA Kit (approved by the
FDA) Distilled water Disposable gloves, lab coats, and
protective eyewear Absorbent pads and laboratory wipes
Laboratory Timer
2. REAGENTS & SUPPLIES:
HBsAg Confirmation Reagent Set (Positive Control, Negative
Control, Wash Buffer, Substrate Solution, Stop Solution, and
Antibody Coated Wells) Disposable pipette tips Multi-channel
pipette reservoirs Distilled water
3. PROCEDURE:
A) Preparation:
Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE).
Allow all reagents, controls, and samples to reach room temperature (20-25°C) before use.
Prepare a workspace with all necessary materials and equipment ready.
B) Sample Preparation:
Centrifuge collected blood samples at 2,000-3,000 RPM for 10-15 minutes to separate the serum.
Carefully aliquot the serum into labeled tubes ensuring there is no contamination.
C) ELISA Testing:
1. Plate Preparation: a) Securely place the antibody-coated wells/
strips in the provided holder. b) Prepare wash buffer according
to the manufacturer’s instructions and bring all reagents to
room temperature.
2. Sample and Control Addition: c) Add 50 µL each of the Negative
Control and Positive Control to designated wells. d) Add 50 µL
of each patient’s serum sample to their respective wells.
3. Reagent Addition: e) Add 50 µL of the conjugate solution to
each well containing Controls and Samples. f) Cover the plate
with the sealer provided and gently mix by swirling. g) Incubate
at 37°C for 60 minutes.
4. Washing Steps: h) Remove the sealer and wash the wells 5
times with wash buffer. Each well should be filled with wash
buffer and discarded.
5. Substrate Reaction: i) Add 100 µL of substrate solution to each
well. j) Incubate the plate at room temperature for 15-30
minutes, protecting it from light.
6. Reaction Stop: k) Add 50 µL of the stop solution to each well. l)
Gently tap the plate to mix the contents, making the color
change uniform.
7. Optical Density Measurement: m) Measure optical density (OD)
at 450 nm using the ELISA reader within 30 minutes.
D) Result Interpretation:
Results are interpreted based on the OD values:
- Positive: OD> Cut-off value (as defined by the manufacturer)
- Negative: OD≤ Cut-off value (as defined by the manufacturer)
1. QUALITY CONTROL:
Perform testing of at least one positive and one negative control
with each run. Records of control values should be maintained
according to laboratory standards. Repeat any tests where
control values are out of range. Only report results when control
values fall within the expected range.
2. REPORTING RESULTS:
Document all results clearly and report via the Laboratory Information
System (LIS) as per laboratory guidelines. Review and verify results
for accuracy.
1. CRITICAL RESULTS:
Results indicating active HBsAg should be reported immediately to
the healthcare provider as per the laboratory policy for timely medical
intervention.
