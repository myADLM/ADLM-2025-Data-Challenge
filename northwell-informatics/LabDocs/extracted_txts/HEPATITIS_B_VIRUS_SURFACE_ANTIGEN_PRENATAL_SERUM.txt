Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Hepatitis B Virus
Surface Antigen Prenatal, Serum
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the accurate detection and
reporting of Hepatitis B Virus Surface Antigen (HBsAg) in prenatal
serum samples.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the assay
and maintaining accurate records. It is the responsibility of all staff to
follow the procedure accurately to ensure the reliability of test results
and to report any discrepancies or issues to the supervisor.
1. SCOPE
This procedure applies to the analytical phase of testing for HBsAg in
prenatal serum specimens received in the laboratory.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type:
• Prenatal serum collected in a serum separator tube (SST).
Specimen Stability:
• Specimens should be stored at 2-8°C for up to 7 days. For longer
storage, freeze at -20°C or lower.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
• Specimens that are improperly labeled or lack identification.
• Specimens that arrive more than 24 hours after collection without
refrigeration or adequate preservation.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• HBsAg Assay Kit (e.g., Abbott ARCHITECT, Roche Elecsys, or
equivalent)
• Calibrators and controls (provided with the assay kit)
• Pipettes and tips
• Microplate reader (if applicable)
• Centrifuge
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
Reagent Storage:
• Store all reagents as per the manufacturer's instructions. Do not
use reagents past their expiration date.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation:
1. Centrifuge the SST tube at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes to separate
the serum.
2. Transfer the serum to a labeled secondary tube if necessary.
3. Inspect the serum for any signs of hemolysis or contamination.
B. Assay Setup:
1. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for setting up the HBsAg
assay.
2. Ensure that all reagents are brought to room temperature prior
to use.
3. Perform a calibration using the kit-provided calibrators
according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
4. Ensure that quality control samples (both positive and negative
controls) are included in each run.
C. Running the Assay:
1. Load the samples, calibrators, and controls into the designated
wells or positions on the automated analyzer.
2. Initiate the assay run according to the equipment manual.
3. Monitor the assay process to ensure proper operation and
completion of the test.
D. Interpretation of Results:
1. Upon completion, review the results generated by the analyzer:
◦ Positive: HBsAg detected
◦ Negative: HBsAg not detected
2. Ensure the controls are within the acceptable ranges as defined
by the manufacturer. If controls are out of range, review assay
setup and rerun the test if necessary.
3. Validate and document all results according to laboratory
protocols.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform quality control checks as per manufacturer’s instructions
and laboratory guidelines.
◦ Include positive and negative controls in each batch/run.
◦ Document QC results and take corrective action if QC fails.
• Calibrate the equipment as recommended by the manufacturer.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Enter the validated results into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
• Report the results in the patient’s electronic medical record.
◦ Positive results should trigger an alert for the follow-up and
care plan.
◦ Negative results should be noted in the prenatal records.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If there are issues with the assay (e.g., equipment malfunction,
invalid controls), refer to the troubleshooting section in the
manufacturer’s manual.
• Repeat testing if necessary and document any deviations from
the standard procedure.
• Consult a supervisor or the on-call pathologist for unresolved
issues.

By following this SOP, laboratory personnel can ensure accurate and
reliable results for the detection of the Hepatitis B Virus Surface
Antigen in prenatal serum samples. This protocol supports timely and
proper clinical follow-up for the well-being of both the expecting
mother and the unborn child.
