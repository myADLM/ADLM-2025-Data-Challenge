Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Hepatitis B Virus Surface Antigen, Quantitative, Serum
1. PURPOSE
This procedure outlines the steps involved in the analytical phase for
generating results for the Hepatitis B Virus Surface Antigen (HBsAg),
quantitative in serum.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory technologists are responsible for
conducting the assay according to the outlined procedures.
• It is the responsibility of the supervisor to ensure that the assay is
performed correctly and that proper documentation and quality
control measures are maintained.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen Type:
• Preferred specimen: Serum
• Specimen Volume: Minimum 1 mL
Collection and Storage:
• Collect the specimen using standard venipuncture techniques.
• Use serum separator tubes (SST).
• Allow the blood to clot for 30 minutes and then centrifuge at 1500
x g for 10 minutes.
• Serum is stable for:
◦ 7 days when stored at 2-8°C
◦ 6 months when stored at -20°C
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed specimens
• Lipemic specimens
• Specimens collected in the wrong tube type
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Automated immunoassay analyzer (e.g., Architect i2000SR or
equivalent)
• Centrifuge
• Calibrated micropipettes and tips
• Refrigerated storage for reagents and specimens
Reagents:
• HBsAg reagent kit (store as per manufacturer’s guidelines)
• Quality control materials (negative and positive controls)
• Calibrators
1. PROCEDURE
Setup and Calibration:
1. Preparation:
◦ Bring all reagents, calibrators, and controls to room
temperature (18-25°C) before use.
◦ Verify reagent lot numbers and expiration dates.
2. Calibration:
◦ Calibrate the system using the manufacturer's
recommended calibrators.
◦ Run at least two levels of calibrators and ensure they are
within the acceptable range before proceeding with patient
samples.
◦ Document calibration results.
Sample Handling:
1. Sample Loading:
◦ Labels corresponding to each patient’s sample should be
checked against the requisition.
◦ Load serum samples onto the analyzer according to the
instrument’s specifications.
2. Assay Procedure:
◦ Select the Hepatitis B surface antigen quantitative assay
protocol on the analyzer.
◦ Load the appropriate reagents as instructed by the
instrument’s software.
◦ Inspect that the samples, controls, and calibrators are
properly placed in their designated positions.
◦ Initiate the run and monitor the instrument for any errors or
issues.
3. Result Generation:
◦ The analyzer will automatically measure the HBsAg
concentration.
◦ Results are generated directly by the automated system and
printed or sent to the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
4. QUALITY CONTROL
Controls:
• Run positive and negative controls with each batch of patient
samples.
• Ensure control results are within the acceptable range before
validating patient results.
• If controls fall outside the acceptable range, troubleshoot
according to manufacturer instructions, and rerun the controls
before releasing any patient results.
Reagent and Instrument Maintenance:
• Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for routine maintenance of
the instrument.
• Maintain a log of maintenance activities.
• Regularly check reagent storage conditions and document any
deviations.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
Review:
• Results should be reviewed by a qualified technologist.
• Verify that control results are within acceptable ranges.
• Review patient results for any flags or outliers.
Documentation:
• Document all patient results, control results, and any deviations in
the appropriate logbooks or electronically in the LIS.
• Maintain records according to the laboratory’s retention policies.
Reference Intervals:
• Negative: <0.05 IU/mL
• Positive: ≥0.05 IU/mL
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• High levels of hemolysis, lipemia, or icterus may interfere with the
assay results.
• Cross-reactions with other antigens might occur; always refer to
the assay insert for detailed limitations.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s reagent kit insert.
• Standard laboratory guidelines and protocols.
• CLSI standards and guidelines.
1. REVISIONS
• This SOP will be reviewed and revised every two years or as new
information becomes available.
