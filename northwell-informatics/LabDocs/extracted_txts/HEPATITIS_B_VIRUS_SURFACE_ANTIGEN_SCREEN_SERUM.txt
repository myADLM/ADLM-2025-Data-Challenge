Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Protocol for Hepatitis B Virus Surface Antigen
(HBsAg) Screening, Serum
1. PURPOSE
This procedure outlines the steps for performing the Hepatitis B Virus
Surface Antigen (HBsAg) screening on serum samples to ensure
accurate and reliable detection of the virus for clinical evaluation.
1. DEFINITION
Hepatitis B Virus Surface Antigen (HBsAg) is an indicator of active
Hepatitis B infection. The presence of HBsAg in serum signifies that
the individual is infectious and may transmit the virus.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen type: Serum Preferred: Serum collected in SST (serum
separator tube) Minimum volume: 2 mL Storage conditions:
• Refrigerated (2-8°C) if analysis is to be conducted within 48 hours
• Frozen (-20°C or lower) for longer storage duration Unacceptable
specimens:
• Hemolyzed samples
• Samples that have not been stored properly or are outside
stability requirements
• Samples collected in anticoagulant tubes
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Centrifuge
• Micropipettes and tips
• Automated analyzer (e.g., Chemiluminescent Immunoassay
analyzer or ELISA reader)
• HBsAg assay kit (e.g., manufactured by Abbott, Roche, Siemens)
• Calibration and control materials (provided by assay kit
manufacturer)
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
1. PROCEDURE
5.1 Pre-Analytical Preparation
• Verify specimen collection and storage conditions.
• Centrifuge serum samples at 3000 RPM for 10 minutes to ensure
clear separation of serum.
• Check for hemolysis or any other sample integrity issues.
• Allow stored frozen samples to reach room temperature before
analysis.
5.2 Assay Preparation:
• Prepare the automated analyzer according to the manufacturer’s
specific instructions.
• Ensure all reagents, calibration materials, and controls are at the
appropriate temperature as required by the assay kit.
5.3 Calibration and Quality Control:
• Run the calibration procedure as directed by the analyzer’s
instructions to ensure proper functioning.
• Test the quality control samples (high, medium, and low) before
proceeding with patient samples to verify assay performance.
• Record all calibration and control results in the logbook.
5.4 HBsAg Detection:
• Load serum samples onto the analyzer as per the manufacturer’s
guidelines.
• Program the analyzer according to the assay protocol specific to
the HBsAg kit (e.g., incubation times, volumes).
• Run the assay.
5.5 Reporting Results:
• The analyzer transmits HBsAg results to the Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
• Review results for each sample, ensuring no analyzer errors ("?/
message codes").
• Verify and report results, adding comments if needed (e.g.,
sample integrity issues).
• Report positive HBsAg results to the clinician and document any
critical result notification in the logbook.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run quality control samples with each lot of assay kits to ensure
reliability.
• Perform intra-lab comparisons bi-weekly and log results.
• Monthly correlation with prior measurements for consistency.
• Document and review all quality control processes and corrective
actions taken for any deviations.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the assay kit’s product insert for specific limitations
associated with HBsAg detection. Factors such as cross-reactivity,
potential interference, and sensitivity must be evaluated.

1. Conclusion
Adherence to this SOP will ensure the accurate detection, reporting,
and documentation of Hepatitis B Virus Surface Antigen results, thus
aiding in effective patient management and clinical decisions.
1. REVIEW AND APPROVAL
This SOP is reviewed annually and updated as necessary to reflect
changes in practice or new recommendations. Approval is obtained
from the laboratory director and technical supervisor.
