Protocol for the Analytical Phase of Generating Results for
Hepatitis B Virus Surface Antigen, Serum (HBsAg)
1. Purpose: To detect the presence of Hepatitis B Virus Surface
Antigen (HBsAg) in serum samples, which indicates an active
Hepatitis B infection.
2. Principle: The detection of HBsAg is performed using Enzyme
Immunoassay (EIA), which utilizes antibodies specific to the Hepatitis
B Surface Antigen to form antigen-antibody complexes. The presence
of these complexes is visualized through a colorimetric reaction.
3. Specimen Requirements:
• Preferred Specimen:
◦ Serum collected in a red-top tube or serum separator tube
(SST).
• Acceptable Specimen:
◦ Plasma collected in EDTA, heparin, or citrate tubes.
• Unacceptable Specimen:
◦ Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
◦ Specimens with insufficient volume or without proper
identification.
• Specimen Storage:
◦ Store at 2-8°C if analysis can be performed within 48 hours.
◦ For longer storage, freeze at -20°C or colder.
4. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies:
• EIA kit for HBsAg detection.
• Microplate washer.
• Microplate reader with a 450 nm filter.
• Pipettes and tips.
• Timer.
• Deionized/distilled water.
• Absorbent paper.
• Serological incubator set to 37°C.
5. Quality Control:
• Include both positive and negative control samples with each run.
• Ensure controls are within the manufacturer's specified ranges.
6. Procedure:
• Preparation:
◦ Bring all reagents and samples to room temperature before
use.
◦ Gently mix the serum samples.
• Assay Steps:
1. Add 100 µL of sample diluent to each well.
2. Add 50 µL of the patient sample or control to the appropriate
wells. Mix by gently tapping the plate.
3. Incubate the plate at 37°C for 60 minutes.
4. Wash the wells six times with approximately 300 µL of wash
buffer per wash.
5. Add 100 µL of enzyme conjugate to each well. Incubate at
37°C for 30 minutes.
6. Wash the wells six times with approximately 300 µL of wash
buffer per wash.
7. Add 100 µL of the substrate solution to each well. Incubate
at room temperature (18-25°C) in the dark for 15 minutes.
8. Add 50 µL of stop solution to each well. Mix by gently
tapping the plate.
9. Read the absorbance of each well at 450 nm using a
microplate reader. Perform the reading within 15 minutes
after adding the stop solution.
7. Interpretation of Results:
• Positive Result:
◦ Sample wells with an optical density (OD) value higher than
the cutoff value (provided by the EIA kit) indicate a positive
result for HBsAg.
• Negative Result:
◦ Sample wells with an OD value lower than the cutoff indicate a
negative result for HBsAg.
• Controls:
◦ Ensure that positive controls exceed the cutoff value and
negative controls are less than the cutoff value to validate the
run.
8. Reporting Results:
• Report results as “HBsAg Positive” if the sample OD is greater
than the cutoff, indicating the presence of Hepatitis B Surface
Antigen.
• Report results as “HBsAg Negative” if the sample OD is less than
the cutoff.
• If the sample result is indeterminate (e.g., near the cutoff value or
outside valid range), repeat the test or request a new sample.
9. Quality Control and Troubleshooting:
• If quality controls fall outside the acceptable range, do not report
patient results.
• Investigate potential issues such as reagent integrity, equipment
calibration, and sample handling.
• If repeating the assay resolves control issues, proceed with
patient sample analysis. If issues persist, consult the supervisor
and manufacturer’s guidelines.

• Relevant laboratory quality management documents.
Note: This protocol must be tailored based on the specific EIA kit
being used for HBsAg detection, adhering to the manufacturer's
instructions.
