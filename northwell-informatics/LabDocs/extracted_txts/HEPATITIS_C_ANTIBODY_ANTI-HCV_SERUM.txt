Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Title: Analytical Phase Protocol
for Generating HEPATITIS C ANTIBODY (ANTI-HCV), SERUM
Results
1. PURPOSE
To provide standardized procedures for the analytical phase of
generating and reporting Hepatitis C Antibody (Anti-HCV) results in
human serum samples to ensure accuracy, reliability, and
reproducibility of the results.
1. SCOPE
This protocol applies to all laboratory personnel responsible for
performing the analytical testing of Anti-HCV in human serum
samples using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or
chemiluminescent immunoassay (CLIA) methods.
1. RESPONSIBILITIES
• Laboratory Technologists: Perform the assay according to the
procedures outlined in this SOP, document observations, and
initiate corrective actions if necessary.
• Supervisors: Ensure staff compliance with the SOP, review
results, evaluate quality control data, and address any issues that
may arise during the analytical process.
1. MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT
• ELISA or CLIA Anti-HCV test kits
• Microplate reader (for ELISA)
• Chemiluminescence analyzer (for CLIA)
• Calibrators and controls (positive and negative)
• Micropipettes and tips
• Vortex mixer
• Timer
• Personal protective equipment (PPE) – gloves, lab coat, safety
goggles
1. PROCEDURE
A) Pre-Analytical Checks
1. Ensure that the specimen has been received, accessioned, and
is labeled correctly.
2. Verify that the reagents and controls are within their expiration
dates and have been stored as per manufacturer’s guidelines.
3. Allow all reagents, samples, and controls to reach room
temperature before beginning the assay.
B) Assay Procedure (Example for ELISA-based Method)
1. Prepare the microplate by adding appropriate volumes of serum
samples, calibrators, and controls to designated wells
according to the kit instructions.
2. Incubate the plate for the specified time at the required
temperature (as per the kit instructions).
3. Wash the wells multiple times with the provided wash buffer to
remove unbound materials.
4. Add the enzyme conjugate to each well and incubate followed
by another wash step.
5. Add the substrate solution and incubate for the specified time.
6. Stop the reaction by adding the stop solution to each well.
7. Measure and record the optical density (OD) at the specified
wavelength using the microplate reader.
C) Assay Procedure (Example for CLIA-based Method)
1. Prepare the samples, calibrators, and controls by mixing them
with magnetic microbeads coated with HCV antigens in the
reaction cuvettes.
2. Incubate the cuvettes in the chemiluminescence analyzer as
per the assay protocol.
3. Wash the cuvettes to remove unbound materials.
4. Add the enzyme conjugate and incubate as specified.
5. Add the substrate and allow the chemiluminescent reaction to
take place.
6. Measure the emitted light and record the results according to
the instrument guidelines.
D) Results Interpretation
1. Compare the OD or Relative Light Units (RLU) for the samples
against the cutoff value determined by the assay calibrator.
2. A result higher than or equal to the cutoff value is considered
reactive for Anti-HCV and indicates potential HCV exposure.
3. A result below the cutoff value is considered non-reactive,
indicating no evidence of HCV exposure.
E) Quality Control
1. Run positive and negative controls with each batch of samples.
2. Review control results. The assay run is considered valid if the
control results are within the established limits.
3. Document any deviations and corrective actions taken if
controls are out of acceptable range.
4. POST-ANALYTICAL
A) Reporting and Documentation
1. Verify and record the test results in the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
2. Ensure that all results are reviewed and authorized by the
supervisor or designated personnel.
3. Report any critical or unusual results to the requesting
healthcare provider promptly.
B) Result Storage and Archiving
1. Store the printed reports and corresponding raw data according
to laboratory policies for the specified retention period.
2. LIMITATIONS
• Evaluate any limitations of the assay as outlined in the
manufacturer-provided package insert, including potential cross-
reactivity, performance characteristics, and sample handling
recommendations.
