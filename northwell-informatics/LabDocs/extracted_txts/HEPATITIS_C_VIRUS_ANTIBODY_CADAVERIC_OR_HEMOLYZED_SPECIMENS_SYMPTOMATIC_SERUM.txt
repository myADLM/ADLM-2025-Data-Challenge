SOP: Analytical Phase for Generating Results for HEPATITIS C
VIRUS ANTIBODY, CADAVERIC OR HEMOLYZED SPECIMENS,
SYMPTOMATIC, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
To provide clear guidelines and procedures for the analysis and
generation of results for Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) antibody testing of
symptomatic serum specimens, including cadaveric or hemolyzed
specimens, in an analytical phase of the laboratory testing process.
This SOP ensures accurate, timely, and reliable test results, vital for
patient diagnosis and management.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory personnel who are trained and certified to
conduct HCV antibody testing are responsible for the accurate
execution of the procedures outlined in this SOP. It is the
responsibility of all staff to identify any issues that may arise during
the analytical process and inform the supervisor immediately.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
A. Acceptable Specimens:
• Serum specimens from symptomatic patients
• Hemolyzed serum specimens
• Cadaveric serum specimens
B. Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens that arrive in the laboratory without proper
identification or labeling
• Specimens that are severely clotted
• Specimens that have been collected inappropriately or with
preservatives that interfere with the assay
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Automated immunoassay analyzer (e.g., ARCHITECT i2000SR
analyzer by Abbott)
• Manufacturer approved HCV antibody reagents and calibrators
• Control serum (negative and positive controls)
• Serological pipettes
• Sample tubes and racks
• Centrifuge
• Personal protective equipment (PPE) including gloves, lab coat,
and safety goggles
1. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Handling:
1. Inspect and confirm that all serum specimens are properly
labeled and sealed.
2. For hemolyzed specimens, ensure that the specimen integrity is
sufficient and meets the criteria for accurate test results.
3. For cadaveric specimens, ensure that the specimen has been
stored and transported compliant with established guidelines to
prevent degradation.
B. Centrifugation:
1. Centrifuge all serum specimens at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes to
separate serum from cellular components.
C. Assay Setup:
1. Calibrate the immunoassay analyzer if it has not been
calibrated within the past 24 hours.
2. Prepare reagents and controls according to the manufacturer's
specifications.
3. Load samples, reagents, calibrators, and controls onto the
analyzer.
D. Running the Assay:
1. Select the HCV antibody test program on the analyzer.
2. Confirm that samples, controls, and calibrators are correctly
positioned and secured.
3. Start the run and monitor the analyzer to ensure proper
functioning.
E. Quality Control:
1. Run both negative and positive quality control samples
alongside patient specimens to ensure assay integrity.
2. Ensure QC results are within acceptable ranges.
3. Document and address any QC failures per the manufacturer's
guidelines and laboratory policy.
4. REPORTING RESULTS
A. Result Review:
1. Review HCV antibody results for all patient specimens,
ensuring that controls fall within the expected ranges.
2. For specimens with questionable integrity (e.g., excessive
hemolysis), use professional judgment to assess whether
results are valid.
B. Interpretation:
• Negative: No antibodies to Hepatitis C Virus detected.
• Positive: Antibodies to Hepatitis C Virus detected.
C. Documentation:
• Document patient results in the laboratory information system
(LIS).
• Ensure all corrective actions taken (if any) for QC failures, or
assay malfunctions are documented.
D. Notification of Results:
1. Immediately notify the appropriate medical personnel of positive
results.
2. Provide a detailed report for the ordering physician following
laboratory protocol.
3. QUALITY ASSURANCE
Regularly review quality control and calibration logs to ensure
consistency and accuracy in the assay. Participate in proficiency
testing for HCV antibody testing as per laboratory accreditation
requirements. Keep all testing and validation records, including lot
numbers, control results, and corrective actions, up to date.
