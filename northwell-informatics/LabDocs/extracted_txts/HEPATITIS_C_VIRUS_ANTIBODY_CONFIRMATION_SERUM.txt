Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Hepatitis C Virus
Antibody Confirmation in Serum
1. PURPOSE:
To confirm the presence of antibodies against Hepatitis C Virus
(HCV) in serum samples using appropriate laboratory techniques.
Responsibility:
Designated staff are responsible for following this SOP to confirm
HCV antibodies in serum samples. It is the responsibility of
supervisors to ensure that all staff are trained and the procedure is
followed accurately.
2. DEFINITION:
HCV Antibody Confirmation: The process involves verifying the
presence of antibodies against the Hepatitis C Virus through specific
confirmatory tests after an initial reactive screening test.
3. PROCEDURE:
Equipment and Reagents:
Reagents:
• HCV Antibody Confirmatory Test Kit (e.g., RIBA, Inno-LIA)
• Controls (Positive and Negative)
Equipment:
• Centrifuge
• Microtitre plate and washer
• Incubator
• Optical density (OD) reader
• Specimen tubes
• Pipettes and tips
Sample Requirements:
Acceptable:
• Serum samples: At least 2 mL of serum collected in a red-top or
serum separator tube (SST).
Unacceptable:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or contaminated serum samples.
• Serum samples received more than 48 hours after collection
without refrigeration or samples not stored at proper temperature.
Storage:
• Store serum samples at 2-8°C if testing within 48 hours.
• For longer storage, freeze samples at -20°C or lower. Avoid
repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
Testing Procedure:
1. Preparation:
◦ Ensure all equipment is calibrated and functioning properly.
◦ Check the expiration dates of all reagents and controls.
◦ Bring all reagents and samples to room temperature before
use.
2. Assay Setup:
◦ Label all microtiter plate wells according to the assay layout.
◦ Include controls (one positive, one negative) along with
patient samples.
3. Sample Processing:
◦ Centrifuge serum samples at 1500-2000 x g for 10 minutes
to separate the serum.
◦ Pipette the required amount of serum into the designated
wells of the microtiter plate.
4. Incubation:
◦ Add required reagents as per the kit’s instructions.
◦ Incubate the plate in the incubator set at 37°C for the
specified duration.
5. Washing:
◦ Follow the washing procedure outlined by the
manufacturer’s instructions to remove unbound antibodies.
6. Detection:
◦ Add secondary antibodies conjugated with enzymes or other
detection methods as per the kit instructions.
◦ Incubate and wash as required.
7. Substrate Reaction:
◦ Add substrate solution and incubate for the specified time
under appropriate conditions.
◦ Stop the reaction by adding stop solution.
8. Reading Results:
◦ Read the optical density at the specified wavelength using
an OD reader.
◦ Calculate and interpret results in accordance with the
manufacturer's guidelines.
Quality Control:
• Run positive and negative controls with each batch of tests to
ensure assay validity.
• If controls do not conform to expected values, the run must be
considered invalid and a new test must be performed.
Reporting Results:
• Reactive/Positive: Presence of HCV antibodies is confirmed if the
patient sample generates an OD value above the established
threshold.
• Non-reactive/Negative: Absence of HCV antibodies is confirmed if
the patient sample generates an OD value below the established
threshold.
• Indeterminate: If the patient sample falls within the gray zone,
repeat the test or use an alternative testing method for
confirmation. Consult with the clinical team for further action.
Reference Intervals:
Refer to the manufacturer’s guidelines for OD cut-off values to
interpret the results accurately.
Method Limitations:
Each manufacturer’s kit may have specific limitations. Refer to the
product insert for detailed information on the limitations of the assay.
