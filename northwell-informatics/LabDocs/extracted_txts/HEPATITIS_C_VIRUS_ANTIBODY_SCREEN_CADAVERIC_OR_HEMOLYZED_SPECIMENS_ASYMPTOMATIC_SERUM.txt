HEPATITIS C VIRUS ANTIBODY SCREEN, CADAVERIC OR
HEMOLYZED SPECIMENS, ASYMPTOMATIC, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
To outline the standard procedures for the analytical phase of the
Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) antibody screening test using cadaveric or
hemolyzed serum specimens from asymptomatic individuals. This
protocol ensures accurate and reliable results by following defined
laboratory practices.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing
the HCV antibody screening test according to this procedure.
• Laboratory supervisors are responsible for ensuring adherence to
this protocol and for addressing any issues or deviations that may
arise.
1. DEFINITIONS
• Cadaveric Specimen: Serum obtained from deceased
individuals.
• Hemolyzed Specimen: Serum samples that have undergone
hemolysis, appearing pink to red due to the release of hemoglobin
from damaged red blood cells.
• Asymptomatic: Individuals showing no symptoms of Hepatitis C
infection.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/acceptable:
• Fresh serum collected in a red top or serum separator tube (SST).
• Cadaveric specimens should be processed as soon as possible
after collection.
• Hemolyzed specimens may be used cautiously for screening
purposes.
Unacceptable:
• Specimens collected in non-serum tubes (e.g., EDTA, heparin,
citrate).
• Specimens grossly hemolyzed, lipemic, or containing clots that
may interfere with analysis.
If these conditions are not met, notify the supervisor for further
instructions and document appropriately.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• HCV antibody test kit (e.g., ELISA-based assays)
• Centrifuge for serum separation
• Micropipettes and tips
• Incubator (if required by assay)
• Plate reader (if applicable)
• Timer
• Controls and calibrators as specified by the test kit manufacturer
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
1. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
• Allow serum specimens to reach room temperature before testing.
• Mix the specimens gently to ensure homogeneity.
Testing Procedure:
1. Label test wells or tubes appropriately.
2. Set up controls and calibrators according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
3. Add the specified volume of serum, control, and calibrator to
the wells or tubes.
4. Follow the incubation steps as instructed by the test kit
manufacturer.
5. Wash wells or tubes as instructed, ensuring complete removal
of washing solution to avoid interference.
6. Add the conjugate and substrate solutions in sequence,
following specific times and temperature conditions.
7. Stop the reaction as per protocol and read the results using the
plate reader or other specified method.
Interpretation:
• Compare sample readings to the control and calibrator values
provided.
• Interpret results according to kit instructions, typically as reactive
(positive) or non-reactive (negative).
• For qualitative assays, record the absorbance readings, and
determine the cutoff value to classify the test results.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform internal quality control using positive and negative
controls with each batch of tests.
• Ensure all controls are within acceptable ranges before reporting
patient results.
• Troubleshoot any control failures immediately and repeat the tests
as necessary.
• Document all quality control results in the QC log.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Document the results in the laboratory information system (LIS) or
manually, following lab-specific guidelines.
• Use the following interpretative criteria:
◦ Reactive: Indicative of HCV antibodies and potential past or
current infection.
◦ Non-reactive: No detectable HCV antibodies.
◦ Indeterminate: Borderline values that require repeat testing or
follow-up with additional assays.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolyzed specimens may interfere with optical density readings
and affect results. Use a second, non-hemolyzed sample if
available.
• False positives or negatives may occur; confirmatory testing (e.g.,
HCV RNA testing) is recommended for reactive results.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Reactive: Presence of HCV antibodies indicated.
• Non-Reactive: Absence of detectable HCV antibodies.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions for HCV antibody test kits.
• Laboratory operational manuals and procedural guidelines.
• CLSI guidelines for serologic assays.
1. SAFEGUARDING AND DISPOSAL
• Dispose of all used materials, including PPE, assay plates, and
specimens, according to biohazard protocols.
• Ensure all biohazard waste is handled per lab safety procedures.
Note: Follow this protocol meticulously to ensure the integrity and
accuracy of the HCV antibody screening results for cadaveric or
hemolyzed serum specimens in asymptomatic individuals.
