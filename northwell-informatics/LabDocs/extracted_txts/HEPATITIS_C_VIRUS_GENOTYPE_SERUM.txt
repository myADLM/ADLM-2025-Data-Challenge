Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) Genotype, Serum
1. Purpose: To outline the procedures for the accurate and reliable
determination of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) genotype in serum samples.
The protocol is designed to ensure consistency, reproducibility, and
compliance with regulatory guidelines.
2. Scope: This SOP applies to the molecular diagnostics laboratory
personnel who are trained and authorized to perform HCV
genotyping using serum samples.
3. Responsibilities: Designated laboratory personnel are
responsible for performing the HCV genotyping assays, including
sample preparation, nucleic acid extraction, amplification,
sequencing, and data analysis. It is the responsibility of all staff to
identify and report any deviations, equipment malfunctions, or
unusual results to the supervisor immediately.
4. Definitions:
• HCV: Hepatitis C Virus
• PCR: Polymerase Chain Reaction
• SOP: Standard Operating Procedure
5. Safety Considerations:
• Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) including
lab coat, gloves, and eye protection.
• Handle all human specimens as potentially infectious.
• Follow all safety and waste disposal regulations.
6. Equipment and Materials:
• Centrifuge
• Tabletop microcentrifuge
• PCR thermocycler
• Real-time PCR instrument
• DNA sequencing equipment or next-generation sequencing
(NGS) platform
• Reagents for nucleic acid extraction
• PCR reagents and consumables
• Positive and negative controls
• Pipettes and tips (aerosol-resistant)
• Molecular grade water
• Labeled centrifuge tubes and PCR tubes
7. Procedure:
7.1 Sample Preparation:
• Acceptable specimens: Serum samples collected in red-top or
serum-separator tubes (SST).
• Unacceptable specimens: Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric
specimens, or those stored improperly.
• All specimens must be properly labeled with patient identification,
date, and time of collection.
7.2 Nucleic Acid Extraction:
• Use an approved nucleic acid extraction kit following the
manufacturer’s instructions.
• Ensure the inclusion of both positive and negative extraction
controls.
• Elute nucleic acids in the recommended volume of elution buffer.
• Store extracted nucleic acids at -80°C if not proceeding directly to
amplification.
7.3 PCR Amplification:
• Prepare the PCR master mix with the necessary reagents
according to the kit protocol.
• Add the extracted nucleic acid to the PCR master mix in a sterile,
nucleic acid-free environment.
• Include appropriate positive, negative, and no-template controls.
• Perform PCR amplification following the thermal cycling
conditions specified in the HCV genotyping assay protocol.
7.4 Post-PCR Handling:
• To prevent contamination, handle amplified products in a
designated post-PCR area.
• Proceed with the sequencing protocol provided by the test kit or
laboratory guidelines.
7.5 Sequencing and Data Analysis:
• Perform DNA sequencing using an automated sequencer or NGS
platform.
• Analyze sequences using validated bioinformatics tools or
software to determine the HCV genotype.
• Verify the sequencing results with the positive control to ensure
accuracy.
• Interpret the data according to the established guidelines and
report the HCV genotype.
8. Quality Control:
• Conduct quality control checks using positive and negative
controls with each batch of samples tested.
• Document all control results and any deviations along with
corrective actions taken.
• Participate in external proficiency testing programs for HCV
genotyping.
9. Reporting Results:
• Enter results into the laboratory information system (LIS) for
review and verification by the technologist.
• Ensure timely communication of critical results as per laboratory
policy.
• Include the HCV genotype in the patient's report, along with any
comments necessary to interpret the result.
10. Result Intervals:
• Specific HCV genotype (e.g., 1a, 1b, 2, 3, etc.)
• If the genotype cannot be determined due to low viral load or
other factors, report as “Genotype indeterminate, resample
requested.”
11. References:
• Kit manufacturer’s instructions and package inserts.
• Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines.
• Journal articles and scientific literature on HCV genotyping.
12. Document Review and Approval:
• This SOP will be reviewed annually or when there are changes to
relevant procedures, guidelines, or regulations.
• Approved by: [Name, Title, Date]
13. Version History:
• Version 1.0: [Date of Implementation]
This document serves as the official protocol for the analytical phase
of generating results for Hepatitis C Virus Genotype, Serum in our
CLIA-certified laboratory. Adherence to the guidelines set forth in this
SOP will ensure high-quality and reliable results.
