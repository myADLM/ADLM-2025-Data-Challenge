STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP) Hepatitis C Virus
(HCV) Genotypic Antiviral Drug Resistance, Serum
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the analysis of Hepatitis C
Virus (HCV) genotypic antiviral drug resistance in serum. This
procedure is applied to identify mutations in the HCV genome that
are associated with resistance to antiviral drugs.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
• Designated laboratory personnel trained in molecular techniques
will perform the procedures.
• Supervisors will ensure compliance with the SOP and handle any
procedural deviations.
• Laboratory staff will document all critical steps, findings, and any
discrepancies or errors during the process.
3. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• PCR machine
• Gel electrophoresis apparatus
• Centrifuge
• Micropipettes and tips
• Spin columns and collection tubes (for RNA extraction)
• Reagents and buffers for RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis
• Mastermix for PCR amplification
• Sequencing reagents and supplies
• Appropriate PPE (gloves, lab coat, face shield)
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• The specimen required is 5-10 mL of serum from the patient.
• Serum should be stored at -20°C if not processed immediately.
Avoid multiple freeze-thaw cycles.
• Ensure serum is centrifuged, separated, and aliquoted
appropriately.
5. PROCEDURE
A) RNA Extraction:
1. Thaw the serum sample, if frozen.
2. Use a spin column RNA extraction kit to isolate HCV RNA from
the serum:
◦ Add 250 µL of serum to the lysis buffer.
◦ Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for subsequent wash
and elution steps.
◦ Elute the RNA in 50 µL of RNase-free water.
3. Assess the RNA quantity and purity using a spectrophotometer.
B) Reverse Transcription (RT):
1. Prepare the RT reaction mixture:
◦ 10 µL RNA template
◦ 1 µL random hexamers
◦ 4 µL RT buffer
◦ 2 µL dNTP mix
◦ 1 µL RNase inhibitor
◦ 2 µL Reverse Transcriptase enzyme
◦ Nuclease-free water up to 20 µL
2. Incubate the mixture at 42°C for 60 minutes, then inactivate the
enzyme at 85°C for 5 minutes.
C) PCR Amplification:
1. Prepare the PCR mastermix:
◦ 5 µL cDNA template
◦ 25 µL PCR buffer (containing MgCl2)
◦ 1 µL dNTP mix
◦ 1 µL of each primer (forward and reverse)
◦ 0.5 µL Taq DNA polymerase
◦ Nuclease-free water up to 50 µL
2. Program the PCR machine with the following settings:
◦ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 3 minutes
◦ 35 cycles of:
▪ Denaturation: 95°C for 30 seconds
▪ Annealing: 55°C for 30 seconds
▪ Extension: 72°C for 1 minute
◦ Final extension: 72°C for 7 minutes
3. Run the PCR products on an agarose gel to confirm the
amplification of expected fragments.
D) Sequencing:
1. Purify the PCR products using a spin column purification kit.
2. Quantify the purified PCR products using a spectrophotometer.
3. Set up the sequencing reaction according to the manufacturer's
instructions for the sequencing kit.
4. Clean-up the sequencing reaction products and run them on a
sequencing machine.
E) Data Analysis:
1. Analyze the sequencing data using specialized software to
identify HCV genotypic variants.
2. Compare the identified sequences against known HCV
resistant mutation databases to determine antiviral resistance.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include positive and negative controls in each run to ensure
accuracy.
• Validate new lots of reagents and batches of primers/probes/
sequencing kits before routine use.
• Record all control results and any deviations from expected
results.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
• Review and verify the sequencing data.
• Interpret the data based on known resistance-associated
mutations.
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS) and
generate a diagnostic report.
• If critical results are obtained, directly communicate findings to the
requesting physician and document the communication.
