Protocol for HEPATITIS C VIRUS (HCV) ANTIBODY SCREEN
PRENATAL, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
To provide detailed instructions for the analytical phase of generating
results for the Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) Antibody Screen for prenatal
serum samples. This SOP ensures the accurate detection of HCV
antibodies to aid in the screening of pregnant women for HCV
exposure.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all laboratory personnel to:
• Follow this protocol accurately and to report any deviations to a
supervisor.
• Ensure all instruments and reagents used are maintained and
calibrated according to the manufacturer’s instructions and
laboratory policy.
• Document all procedural steps, observations, and corrective
actions taken during the analytical phase.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/acceptable:
• Serum collected in a plain (red-top) tube or serum separator tube
(SST).
• Minimum volume: 2 ml of serum.
• Specimens must be centrifuged and separated from clot within 2
hours of collection.
Unacceptable:
• Specimens that are hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric.
• Specimens that have been subjected to repeated freeze-thaw
cycles.
• Specimens not labeled properly or without a collection date/time.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Chemiluminescence Immunoassay (CLIA) analyzer.
• HCV Antibody Reagents, Controls, and Calibrators (per
manufacturer’s instructions).
• Laboratory consumables such as pipettes, tips, and sample cups.
• QC material (as recommended by the reagent manufacturer).
1. PROCEDURE
Pre-Analytical Preparations:
1. Confirm the patient’s information matches the specimen details.
2. Verify that the specimen meets the acceptance criteria. If
unacceptable, request a new sample.
3. Ensure the specimen has been appropriately processed and
stored, and is at the correct temperature (2-8°C if refrigerated).
Instrument Preparation:
1. Turn on the CLIA analyzer and perform any daily maintenance
checks as per the manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Load reagents, controls, and calibrators according to
manufacturer’s guidelines.
3. Perform calibration as required. Calibration should be
performed whenever a new lot of reagents is used, or as
specified by the manufacturer.
Sample Processing:
1. Allow specimens, reagents, and controls to reach room
temperature.
2. Label sample cups with the appropriate specimen ID.
3. Pipette 200 µL of the serum sample into a sample cup, ensuring
no cross-contamination.
4. Place the sample cups in the designated position in the
analyzer.
5. Verify and program the analyzer to perform the HCV antibody
test for the loaded samples.
Running the Test:
1. Start the run on the analyzer following the manufacturer’s
instructions.
2. The analyzer will automatically process the samples and
generate chemiluminescence signals which correlate to the
presence of HCV antibodies.
3. Monitor the run and ensure there are no flags or errors. If flags
or errors occur, troubleshoot according to the manufacturer’s
instructions and document any corrective actions.
Result Interpretation:
1. Review the raw data and calculated values generated by the
analyzer.
2. Verify that control values fall within the acceptable ranges. If
controls are out of range, rerun the controls and troubleshoot
any issues.
3. If the sample produces a positive result for HCV antibodies,
reflex testing with HCV RNA PCR may be required to confirm
active infection.
Quality Control:
1. Run positive and negative controls with each batch of samples.
2. Document QC results in the Quality Control Log.
3. Ensure all QC results are within the acceptable range before
reporting patient results. If QC failure occurs, do not release
patient results until the issue is resolved.
Reporting Results:
1. Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
2. Positive results should be flagged and reviewed by a qualified
personnel. Additional testing (e.g., HCV RNA PCR) should be
suggested if necessary.
3. Ensure timely communication of critical or unexpected results to
the healthcare provider.
4. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Non-reactive: No detectable HCV antibodies.
• Reactive: Presence of HCV antibodies indicating exposure to
HCV; further confirmation may be required.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to the manufacturer’s instructions for the specific reagent kit
being used for detailed method limitations.
• False-positive results can occur due to cross-reactivity with other
antibodies or autoantibodies.
• Specimens from patients on immunosuppressive therapy or with
other immune system disorders may yield false-negative results.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's Instructions for Use (IFU) for the HCV antibody
screening reagent kit.
• Laboratory standard operating procedures and manuals.
• Relevant clinical guidelines and protocols for prenatal screening.
1. DOCUMENTATION
• Ensure all procedural steps, QC results, and any deviations or
corrective actions are documented in the laboratory records.
• Maintain accurate and complete records of all HCV antibody
screening tests performed and results obtained.
Adaptation of this protocol is required whenever new instruments,
reagents, or procedures are introduced, and it must be reviewed and
approved regularly to ensure compliance with current best practices
and regulatory requirements.
