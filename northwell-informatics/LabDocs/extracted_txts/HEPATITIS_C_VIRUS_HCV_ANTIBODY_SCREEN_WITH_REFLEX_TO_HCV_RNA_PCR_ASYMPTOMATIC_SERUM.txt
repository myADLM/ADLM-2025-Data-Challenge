SOP: Detection of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) Antibody with Reflex
to HCV RNA, PCR, Asymptomatic, Serum
1. Purpose
To outline the standard procedure for the detection of Hepatitis
C virus (HCV) antibodies, with reflex to HCV RNA PCR testing
if the antibody screening result is positive in asymptomatic
individuals.
Responsibility
The designated laboratory personnel are responsible for
following this protocol and ensuring the accurate and timely
analysis of the HCV antibody and RNA PCR results.
2. Definitions
HCV Antibody Screening: An initial test to detect antibodies to
HCV, indicating previous or ongoing infection.
HCV RNA PCR Test: A confirmatory test used to detect the
presence of HCV RNA, indicating an active infection.
3. Specimen Requirements
Specimen Type: Serum
Preferred Volume: 5 mL of serum
Acceptable Volume: 3 - 5 mL of serum
Specimen Storage: Refrigerate at 2-8°C for up to 5 days if not
testing immediately. For long-term storage, freeze at -20°C or
lower.
4. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies
◦ Centrifuge
◦ Pipettes and tips
◦ Serum separator tubes (SST)
◦ HCV antibody ELISA kit
◦ PCR reagents and Master Mix (for HCV RNA detection)
◦ Thermocycler
◦ Vortex mixer
◦ Micropipettes
◦ Samples and controls
◦ Personal protective equipment (gloves, lab coat, goggles)
5. Procedure
A. Serum Preparation
1. Centrifuge collected blood samples in SST at 1000-1500 x
g for 10-15 minutes.
2. Carefully separate the serum from the clot without
disturbing the cell layer.
3. Label the serum aliquots accurately with patient
identification details.
B. HCV Antibody Screening
1. Prepare the HCV antibody ELISA kit and reagents as per
the manufacturer's instructions.
2. Pipette the appropriate amount of patient serum into
designated wells.
3. Add controls and standards to respective wells.
4. Incubate and wash the plate as per the kit instructions.
5. Add substrate solution and incubate for the specified time.
6. Add stop solution and measure absorbance at the
specified wavelength using a microplate reader.
C. Interpretation of Results
◦ Negative Result: Report as "HCV antibody not detected."
◦ Positive Result: Proceed to HCV RNA PCR testing.
D. HCV RNA PCR Testing
1. Extract RNA from the serum sample using a viral RNA
extraction kit, following the manufacturer's protocol.
2. Prepare the PCR Master Mix, including primers, probes,
enzymes, and other components as per the kit
instructions.
3. Mix the extracted RNA with the PCR Master Mix.
4. Load the reaction mixture into designated wells of the
PCR plate.
5. Run the PCR reactions using the thermocycler under the
appropriate cycling conditions.
6. Analyze the PCR data to determine the presence of HCV
RNA.
E. Interpretation and Reporting of Results
◦ HCV RNA Not Detected: Report as "HCV RNA not
detected. HCV antibody positive."
◦ HCV RNA Detected: Report as "HCV RNA detected. Active
HCV infection."
◦ Document all results meticulously in the laboratory
information system (LIS).
6. Quality Control
◦ Run positive and negative controls with each batch of tests
to ensure accurate results.
◦ Follow the manufacturer's guidelines for acceptance criteria
for control results.
◦ Record quality control results and perform troubleshooting if
controls do not meet acceptance criteria.
7. Results Reporting
◦ Verify all patient test results by authorized laboratory
personnel before reporting.
◦ Ensure that all results are recorded accurately in the LIS
and communicated to the appropriate medical provider.
8. Reference Intervals
Refer to the manufacturer’s kit insert for the reference ranges
for both HCV antibody screening and RNA PCR tests.
9. Method Limitations
◦ Refer to the manufacturer’s kit inserts for specific limitations
and interferences related to each testing kit.
10. References

inserts for the HCV RNA PCR assay.
Note: Constantly review the most recent guidelines and
recommendations from relevant health authorities to ensure
compliance and utilize the most updated protocol.
