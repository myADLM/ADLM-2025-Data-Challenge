Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for HCV Antibody with
Reflex to HCV RNA, PCR, Symptomatic, Serum
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this protocol is to outline the procedures for the
analytical phase of generating results for Hepatitis C Virus (HCV)
Antibody with Reflex to HCV RNA, PCR, symptomatic, serum testing.
1. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory staff involved in the analytical
processing and reporting of HCV antibody and reflex HCV RNA PCR
testing.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory personnel to
ensure that all procedures are followed accurately and precisely in
order to generate valid test results. Any deviations or abnormalities
detected during testing must be reported to the supervisor.
1. PRINCIPLE
This test includes an initial screening for HCV antibodies using an
automated immunoassay. If the initial antibody test is positive or
equivocal, a reflex RNA PCR test is conducted to detect the presence
of HCV RNA, confirming active HCV infection.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type:
• Serum
Collection:
• A minimum of 3 mL of serum is required.
• Collect blood into a Serum Separator Tube (SST).
• Specimens should be processed and separated (centrifuged)
within 2 hours of collection.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
Equipment:
• Centrifuge
• Automated immunoassay analyzer (e.g., Architect, Cobas e601,
Alinity i)
• PCR instrument (e.g., Roche Cobas 6800/8800)
Reagents:
• HCV Antibody reagent cartridges specific to the instrumentation
used
• HCV RNA PCR reagents and controls
1. PROCEDURE
A. HCV Antibody Screening:
1. Preparation:
◦ Ensure all reagents and controls are at room temperature
before use.
◦ Perform maintenance, calibration, and quality control as per
manufacturer’s guidelines.
2. Loading Samples:
◦ Label samples with unique identifier.
◦ Load serum samples onto the automated immunoassay
analyzer.
◦ Follow the manufacturer's protocol for running HCV antibody
tests.
3. Conducting Test:
◦ Follow standard operating procedures for the immunoassay
analyzer.
◦ At the end of the run, review the results.
4. Result Interpretation:
◦ If the result is negative, report as “HCV Antibody Negative.”
◦ If the result is positive or equivocal, proceed to the reflex
HCV RNA PCR test.
B. HCV RNA PCR Testing:
1. Preparation:
◦ Confirm that RNA extraction and PCR setup reagents are
ready and at the correct temperature.
◦ Ensure that the PCR instrument is functioning correctly and
is calibrated.
2. RNA Extraction:
◦ Use an appropriate RNA extraction kit as per manufacturer’s
instructions.
◦ Load samples and controls onto the RNA extraction
instrument.
3. PCR Setup:
◦ Prepare the PCR master mix and aliquot into wells or tubes
as per protocol.
◦ Add extracted RNA to the PCR wells or tubes.
◦ Seal the plate or tubes and load onto the PCR instrument.
4. PCR Amplification and Detection:
◦ Run the PCR under the conditions specified by the
manufacturer.
◦ At the end of the cycle, analyze the amplification data.
5. Result Interpretation:
◦ RNA Detected: Active HCV infection. Report as “HCV RNA
Detected.”
◦ RNA Not Detected: No active HCV infection. Report as
“HCV RNA Not Detected.”
6. QUALITY CONTROL
7. Run appropriate external controls (positive, negative, and
internal)
◦ At the beginning and end of each test run
◦ At each shift change
◦ Following any maintenance or troubleshooting procedures
8. Any QC failures must be documented and investigated.
9. Review all QC data prior to releasing patient results.
10. REPORTING RESULTS
11. Document all results in the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
12. Ensure HCV antibody final results and any reflex HCV RNA
PCR results are interpreted and communicated as per
laboratory policy.
13. Added comments:
◦ For positive HCV antibodies with detected HCV RNA:
"Active HCV infection confirmed."
◦ For equivocal HCV antibodies with non-detected HCV RNA:
"Repeat sampling recommended due to initial equivocal
antibody result."
14. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• HCV Antibody: Non-reactive (negative) or Reactive (positive)
• HCV RNA PCR: Not Detected or Detected
1. LIMITATIONS
2. False negative antibody tests may occur in
immunocompromised patients.
3. PCR assay may fail if RNA is degraded; ensure prompt
handling of the specimen.
4. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's Instructions for Use (IFU) for HCV antibody and
HCV RNA PCR reagents.
• Relevant clinical guidelines on HCV diagnosis and monitoring.
1. REVIEW AND DOCUMENTATION
2. Review this SOP annually or as needed based on changes to
protocols or equipment.
3. Document changes and date of review.
