HEPATITIS C VIRUS (HCV) RNA DETECTION AND
QUANTIFICATION BY REAL-TIME REVERSE TRANSCRIPTION-
PCR (RT-PCR)
1. PURPOSE
To outline the standardized procedure for the detection and
quantification of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) RNA in human plasma or
serum specimens using Real-Time Reverse Transcription-
Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) to ensure consistent, reliable,
and accurate results.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing
the procedure, ensuring the quality control of the reagents and
instruments, and maintaining accurate records according to this
SOP.
• It is the responsibility of all staff to report any deviances in the
procedure that may affect the test results to their supervisor.
1. DEFINITION
HCV RNA Detection and Quantification refers to the identification and
measurement of Hepatitis C viral RNA in a sample through Real-Time
RT-PCR. This technique allows the detection of the presence of the
virus as well as the quantification of viral load.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Requirements:
• Acceptable specimens: Plasma or serum.
• Collection: Collect blood in EDTA tubes for plasma or serum
separator tubes for serum.
• Handling: Process the blood within 6 hours of collection. If there is
a delay, store serum/plasma at 2- 8°C for up to 72 hours or freeze
at -20°C or lower for extended storage.
• Transport: Transport samples on ice if used within 72 hours or
transport on dry ice if frozen.
B. Reagents and Supplies:
• RNA extraction kit compatible with HCV RNA detection.
• Real-Time RT-PCR reagents, including HCV-specific primers and
probes.
• Nuclease-free water.
• Calibrators and quantification standards.
• Positive and negative controls.
• 96-well plates and compatible optical covers.
• Certified pipettes and sterile pipette tips with aerosol barriers.
• Dedicated laboratory workspace and equipment for RNA
extraction and PCR setup to prevent cross-contamination.
C. Instrumentation:
• Real-Time PCR Thermocycler.
• Microcentrifuge.
• Vortex mixer.
• Biosafety cabinet for RNA extraction.
D. Procedural Steps:
1. RNA Extraction:
◦ Extract RNA from serum/plasma samples using an RNA
extraction kit as per the manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Include both positive and negative extraction controls.
◦ Quantify and assess the purity of the extracted RNA.
2. RT-PCR Master Mix Preparation:
◦ Thaw all reagents and samples on ice before use.
◦ Prepare the RT-PCR master mix on ice including reverse
transcriptase, primers, probes, nucleotides, buffer, and
nuclease-free water as specified in the kit protocol.
◦ Vortex the mix gently and briefly centrifuge.
3. Plate Setup:
◦ Pipette the appropriate volume of the RT-PCR master mix
into each well of a 96-well plate.
◦ Add extracted RNA samples, standards for quantification,
and controls to the respective wells.
◦ Seal the plate with optical adhesive film or caps ensuring no
bubbles are present and wells are sealed properly.
◦ Centrifuge the plate briefly to ensure contents are at the
bottom of the wells.
4. RT-PCR Program Setup:
◦ Place the plate into the Real-Time PCR thermocycler.
◦ Program the thermocycler according to the RT-PCR kit
instructions typically involving reverse transcription at 50°C,
initial denaturation at 95°C, and 40-45 cycles of
denaturation at 95°C and annealing/extension at a specified
temperature.
5. Run and Analyze PCR:
◦ Start the RT-PCR run and monitor the amplification plots.
◦ Analyze the data post-run for the quantification cycle (Cq)
values.
E. Data Interpretation:
• Calculate viral RNA concentrations based on the quantification
standards.
• The Cq values obtained for standards, controls, and samples
should fall within the expected range for the run to be valid.
• Negative controls should not exhibit amplification; positive
controls should be in the specified Cq range.
• Samples with Cq values within the quantifiable range (based on
standards) provide the HCV RNA quantity.
F. Quality Control:
• Perform quality control with each RT-PCR run using positive,
negative, and internal controls.
• Regularly calibrate and maintain all instruments as per
manufacturer recommendations.
• Record all QC measures in the appropriate log.
G. Documentation:
• Record extracted RNA quality, RT-PCR run details, results, and
any deviations in the designated logbook or digital system.
• Report results in accordance with laboratory guidelines ensuring
verification by the technologist.
H. Troubleshooting:
• If controls fail, do not report patient results; re-examine procedural
steps, reagents, and instruments. Re-extract RNA and rerun the
assay if necessary.
• Ensure no contamination occurred by verifying negative controls
throughout the workflow.
