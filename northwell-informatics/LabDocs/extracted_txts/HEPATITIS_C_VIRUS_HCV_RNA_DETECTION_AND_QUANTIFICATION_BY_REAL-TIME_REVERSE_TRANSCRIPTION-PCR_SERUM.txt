STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP) FOR HEPATITIS C
VIRUS (HCV) RNA DETECTION AND QUANTIFICATION BY REAL-
TIME REVERSE TRANSCRIPTION-PCR
1. PURPOSE
This procedure outlines the steps to be followed for the detection and
quantification of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) RNA in serum samples
using real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-
PCR). Results generated will be used to aid in the diagnosis and
monitoring of HCV infection.
Responsibility:
Designated qualified laboratory personnel are responsible for
performing and documenting all steps in this procedure. It is the
responsibility of supervisors to ensure compliance with this SOP and
all necessary corrective actions are taken if any issues arise during
the process.
1. DEFINITION
• RT-PCR: Real-time Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain
Reaction, a laboratory technique combining reverse transcription
of RNA into DNA and amplification using PCR.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Acceptable specimens:
• Serum samples separated from clotted whole blood collected in a
sterile tube.
• Samples should be transported to the lab and stored at 2-8°C if
they are to be tested within 72 hours. For longer storage, serum
specimens should be frozen at -20°C or -80°C.
Unacceptable specimens:
• Serum samples that are hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric.
• Specimens not kept on proper storage conditions prior to
analysis.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Real-Time PCR thermal cycler
• Refrigerator and Freezers (-20°C and -80°C)
• Vortex
• Centrifuge
• Micropipettes and sterile filter tips
Reagents:
• HCV RT-PCR Master Mix
• HCV RNA extraction kit
• Nuclease-free water
• Positive and negative controls
Supplies:
• PCR tubes/plates and optical seals
• Sterile, nuclease-free tubes
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation of Reagents and Materials:
• Thaw all reagents, RNA extraction kits, and controls as per
manufacturer instructions.
• Prepare the RT-PCR master mix as prescribed by the
manufacturer.
B. RNA Extraction:
1. Prepare serum samples by thawing completely at room
temperature.
2. Vortex the sample briefly and centrifuge if necessary.
3. Use an RNA extraction kit following the manufacturer’s protocol
to extract HCV RNA from the serum sample.
4. Elute the RNA into a nuclease-free tube and store on ice. For
longer storage prior to PCR, keep extracted RNA at -20°C or
-80°C.
C. RT-PCR Setup:
1. Prepare the RT-PCR reaction mix by combining the master mix,
primers, probes, and nuclease-free water. The total volume
should be scaled to include the number of samples, controls,
and an overage for pipetting errors.
2. Aliquot the prepared RT-PCR reaction mix into the PCR tubes/
plate.
3. Add extracted RNA from patient samples, positive control, and
negative control to their respective wells.
4. Seal the PCR tubes/plate securely and centrifuge briefly to
ensure all contents are at the bottom of the wells.
D. Thermal Cycling Conditions:
Program the Real-Time PCR instrument with the following cycling
conditions:
• Reverse transcription: 50°C for 15 minutes
• Initial denaturation: 95°C for 10 minutes
• Amplification: 40 cycles of:
◦ Denaturation: 95°C for 15 seconds
◦ Annealing/Extension: 60°C for 1 minute
E. Run the PCR Instrument:
1. Load the sealed PCR tubes/plate into the real-time PCR
instrument.
2. Start the run and ensure the instrument is correctly recording
fluorescence data.
F. Post-Run Analysis:
1. Upon completion, verify the PCR results by reviewing the
amplification plots and Ct (Cycle threshold) values.
2. Controls must meet the following criteria:
◦ Negative control: No detectable Ct values or amplification
curves.
◦ Positive control: Detectable Ct values within the expected
range.
G. Reporting Results:
• Results are typically expressed in International Units per milliliter
(IU/mL) or copies/mL.
• Results should be documented and transmitted to the LIS for
verification.
Critical Results:
• Any unexpected results, such as invalid controls or unusual
amplification curves, should be reviewed and possibly repeated.
Quality Control:
• Run positive and negative controls with each batch of samples.
• Verify that all instruments are calibrated and maintained as per
recommended schedules.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
Refer to specific site reporting guidelines. Ensure all results are
reviewed and verified by the technologist before reporting to the
clinician.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Reportable range and interpretation criteria should be used according
to laboratory standards and the test manufacturer's instructions.
8. ACTION ON RESULTS:
• Positive results with detectable HCV RNA should be reported to
the clinician for patient management.
• Negative results with undetectable HCV RNA should indicate no
active viral infection, though other clinical evaluations should be
considered.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
• Analytical limitations should be referred to in the RT-PCR kit
insert, ensuring accurate RNA detection and quantification.
• False negatives could occur if specimens are improperly
collected, handled, or stored.
