Standard Operating Procedure
1. PURPOSE
This SOP describes the procedure for the detection and
quantification of hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA in prenatal serum
samples using real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR)
methodology. The accurate detection and quantification of HCV RNA
is essential for the diagnosis, prognosis, and monitoring of HCV
infection in pregnant individuals.
Responsibility:
Laboratory personnel are responsible for following this protocol
accurately to ensure consistent and reliable results. It is the
responsibility of the laboratory supervisor to ensure that personnel
are adequately trained and that equipment and reagents are
maintained and used correctly.
2. DEFINITIONS AND ABBREVIATIONS
• HCV: Hepatitis C Virus
• RNA: Ribonucleic Acid
• RT-PCR: Real-Time Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain
Reaction
• cDNA: Complementary DNA
• PCR: Polymerase Chain Reaction
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Serum
• Collection Container: Serum separator tube (SST)
• Volume Required: Minimum of 1 mL serum
• Stability: Serum should be separated from clot and stored at
2-8°C for up to 72 hours. For longer storage, freeze at -70°C or
colder.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• Real-time PCR instrument
• Microcentrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Pipettes and filter tips (10 µL to 1000 µL range)
• RNA extraction kit
• RT-PCR reagents consisting of:
◦ Reverse transcriptase enzyme
◦ PCR master mix
◦ Primers and probes specific for HCV RNA
◦ Positive and negative control samples
• Nuclease-free water
• PCR plates/tubes and optical adhesive film or caps
5. PROCEDURE
A. RNA Extraction
1. Sample Preparation
◦ Thaw serum samples completely if previously frozen.
◦ Aliquot 200 µL of serum into a clean microcentrifuge tube.
2. RNA Isolation
◦ Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for the RNA
extraction kit. This includes cell lysis, binding of RNA to a
column, washing, and eluting purified RNA.
◦ Elute RNA in 50 µL of nuclease-free water.
◦ Store the extracted RNA at -70°C if not used immediately.
B. Reverse Transcription and Real-time PCR Amplification
1. Preparation of Master Mix
◦ Prepare the master mix on ice according to the instructions
provided with the RT-PCR kit. The master mix should
contain:
▪ Reverse transcriptase enzyme
▪ PCR buffer and nucleotides
▪ HCV-specific primers and probe
▪ MgCl2 (if required by the kit)
◦ Aliquot 15 µL of master mix into each well of a PCR plate.
2. Addition of RNA Template
◦ Add 10 µL of extracted RNA (sample) to the corresponding
wells containing the master mix.
◦ Include positive control, negative control, and no template
control (NTC) in separate wells.
3. Thermal Cycling Conditions
◦ Seal the PCR plate with optical adhesive film or caps.
◦ Load the plate into the real-time PCR instrument.
◦ Program the thermal cycling conditions according to the RT-
PCR kit instructions. Typically the cycle will include:
▪ Reverse Transcription: 50°C for 30 min
▪ Initial Denaturation: 95°C for 10 min
▪ Amplification (40-45 cycles):
▪ Denaturation: 95°C for 15 sec
▪ Annealing/Extension: 60°C for 1 min
C. Data Analysis and Interpretation
1. Result Analysis
◦ Analyze the data using the real-time PCR instrument
software.
◦ The software will generate cycle threshold (Ct) values for
each sample.
◦ Quantify viral loads using standard curves derived from
serial dilutions of a known HCV RNA standard.
2. Interpreting Results
◦ A Ct value within the expected range for the positive control
confirms the assay performance.
◦ Absence of amplification in the NTC confirms no
contamination in reagents.
◦ Detection (Ct value within the cycling threshold) in samples
indicates the presence of HCV RNA.
◦ Quantitative results are provided in IU/mL using the
standard curve.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run controls (positive control and NTC) with every batch of
samples processed.
• Record all control results and ensure they fall within the
acceptable ranges.
• If controls fail, investigate potential causes (e.g., reagent quality,
operator error) and repeat the run.
• Participate in external quality assessment (EQA) programs when
available.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
• Report quantitative HCV RNA results in IU/mL.
• Include information on sample integrity, potential interferences,
and any deviations from the SOP in the final report.
• Provide a reference range (e.g., undetectable to predetermined
linear range of the assay).
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Ensure proper sample storage and handling to avoid RNA
degradation.
• The presence of PCR inhibitors can affect the results. Consider
sample repeat or additional purification steps if inhibition is
suspected.
• Accurate quantification is dependent on the linearity of the
standard curve.

• Manufacturer's instruction manuals for RNA extraction kit and RT-
PCR kit.
• Peer-reviewed articles on the detection and quantification of HCV
RNA using real-time RT-PCR.
10. REVISIONS
• Document any changes to the protocol, including dates of revision
and reason for changes, in this section.
