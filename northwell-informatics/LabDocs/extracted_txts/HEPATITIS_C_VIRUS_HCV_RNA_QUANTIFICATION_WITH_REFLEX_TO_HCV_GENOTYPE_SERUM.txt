STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE FOR HEPATITIS C VIRUS
(HCV) RNA QUANTIFICATION WITH REFLEX TO HCV
GENOTYPE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this document is to outline the procedure for the
analytical phase of the HCV RNA quantification with reflex to HCV
genotype testing in serum specimens. The procedure ensures the
accuracy and reliability of results for diagnostic and monitoring
purposes.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of trained laboratory personnel to perform HCV
RNA quantification and, if required, reflex testing to HCV genotype.
Laboratory personnel must follow this SOP and adhere to safety
guidelines, quality control procedures, and documentation practices.
Supervisors are responsible for ensuring adherence to this procedure
and addressing any issues that arise during the analytical phase.
1. SPECIMENS
3.1 Acceptable Specimens:
• Serum specimens collected in SST (serum separator tubes) or
red-top tubes.
• Specimen volume: Minimum 2 mL of serum required.
3.2 Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
• Samples collected in anticoagulant tubes (e.g. EDTA, heparin) are
not acceptable.
• Specimens received without proper labeling or requisition form.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
4.1 Equipment:
• Real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) instrument
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes and tips
• Vortex mixer
• Micropipettes (0.5 µL to 1,000 µL)
• Biosafety cabinet
4.2 Reagents:
• HCV RNA extraction kit
• HCV RNA quantification kit
• HCV Genotyping kit
• Nuclease-free water
• Positive and Negative Controls
1. PROCEDURE
5.1 Specimen Preparation:
• Centrifuge serum specimens at 2,000-3,000 x g for 10-15 minutes
to separate serum.
• Transfer the serum into a new, labeled tube without disturbing the
cellular layer.
• Store prepared serum specimens at 2-8°C if testing within 24
hours or at -20°C for longer storage.
5.2 HCV RNA Extraction:
• Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for the HCV RNA extraction
kit.
• Use appropriate controls to ensure the validity of the extraction
process.
• Elute RNA in nuclease-free water and store on ice until
quantification.
5.3 HCV RNA Quantification:
• Prepare the master mix for real-time PCR according to the
manufacturer’s instructions, including all controls.
• Pipette the master mix and extracted RNA into PCR wells or
tubes.
• Load the real-time PCR instrument with the reaction plate.
• Program the PCR instrument per the kit’s specifications for HCV
RNA quantification.
• Run the PCR and record amplification data.
5.4 Result Interpretation:
• Analyze PCR data to determine HCV RNA viral load.
• If the viral load is below the assay's lower limit of detection, report
as "HCV RNA Not Detected."
• If viral load is detected, proceed to report HCV RNA quantitative
result in IU/mL.
5.5 Reflex HCV Genotyping:
• If HCV RNA is detected, perform reflex testing for HCV genotype.
• Follow the genotyping kit instructions to set up the reaction.
• Perform PCR amplification and analyze genotypic data according
to the kit’s specifications.
• Determine HCV genotype based on the analysis of the PCR
product.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run positive and negative controls with each batch of specimens
to ensure accuracy and validity.
• Analyze control results before interpreting patient results. If
controls do not meet acceptance criteria, troubleshoot and repeat
the assay.
• Document all control results and any corrective actions taken.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• For HCV RNA quantification, report in IU/mL along with a
standardized reference range.
• For HCV genotype, report the specific genotype determined by
reflex testing.
• Document any issues with specimen integrity or assay
performance on the accession log.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• HCV RNA Quantification: Reported in IU/mL; a reference range is
not provided but the viral load is used for clinical decision-making.
• HCV Genotype: Report as type (e.g., 1a, 1b, 2, 3, etc.)
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Accurate quantification and genotyping depend on proper
specimen handling and adherence to manufacturer instructions.
• False negatives may occur if viral load is below the detection limit
or if there is PCR inhibition.
• Mixed infections or atypical genotypes may not be accurately
identified by genotyping assays.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions for RNA extraction, quantification, and
genotyping kits.
• Current guidelines for HCV management and testing as provided
by relevant health authorities (e.g., CDC, WHO, AASLD).
This SOP is effective from the date of approval and will be reviewed
annually or as needed for updates.
