Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for HEPATITIS D VIRUS
TOTAL ANTIBODIES, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
◦ To provide a reliable and consistent method for the detection
and measurement of Hepatitis D Virus (HDV) Total
Antibodies in serum samples. Ensuring that results are
accurate and generated in a timely manner.
2. SCOPE
◦ This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel
performing the HDV Total Antibodies test on serum samples
using the specified enzyme immunoassay (EIA) kit.
3. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
◦ HDV Total Antibodies EIA kit
◦ Calibrators and Controls (Positive and Negative)
◦ Microtiter plates
◦ Washing buffer
◦ Substrate solution
◦ Stop solution
◦ Pipettes and pipette tips
◦ Microplate reader
◦ Latex gloves and laboratory coats
◦ Absorbent towels
4. EQUIPMENT
◦ Micropipettes (single or multi-channel)
◦ Microplate washer
◦ Microplate reader capable of measuring at 450 nm
◦ Incubator capable of maintaining 37°C
◦ Vortex mixer
◦ Centrifuge
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
◦ Specimen type: Serum
◦ Collect blood samples using standard venipuncture
techniques in appropriate blood collection tubes.
◦ Allow the blood to clot at room temperature.
◦ Centrifuge the sample for 10 minutes at 1500-2000 x g to
separate the serum.
◦ Transfer the serum to a labeled polypropylene tube.
◦ Store the serum samples at 2-8°C if testing will be done
within 48 hours. For long-term storage, store the samples at
-20°C or lower. Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
6. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation
◦ Bring all reagents, calibrators, controls, and serum samples
to room temperature (20-25°C) before use.
◦ Prepare washing buffer by diluting the concentrate as per
the kit instructions.
◦ Set up the microtiter plate layout for calibrators, controls,
and patient samples.
B. Assay Procedure
1. Sample addition:
▪ Add 100 µL of each calibrator, control, and serum
sample into designated wells. Perform all assays in
duplicate.
▪ Ensure accurate pipetting to avoid any cross-
contamination.
2. Incubation:
▪ Cover the plate with a plate sealer.
▪ Incubate the plate at 37°C for 60 minutes.
3. Washing:
▪ Carefully remove the plate sealer.
▪ Wash the wells 5 times with the prepared washing
buffer using a microplate washer.
4. Conjugate Addition:
▪ Add 100 µL of the enzyme conjugate to each well.
▪ Incubate the plate at 37°C for 30 minutes.
5. Washing Again:
▪ Remove the contents of the wells and wash the wells
5 times with the washing buffer.
6. Substrate Addition:
▪ Add 100 µL of the substrate solution to each well.
▪ Incubate the plate at room temperature for 15 minutes,
protecting from light.
7. Stopping of the reaction:
▪ Add 100 µL of stop solution to each well.
▪ Gently tap the plate to ensure thorough mixing.
C. Reading and Interpretation:
◦ Read the absorbance of each well at 450 nm using a
microplate reader within 10 minutes of adding the stop
solution.
◦ Calculate the mean absorbance for each calibrator, control,
and patient sample.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Include negative and positive controls in each assay to
ensure the accuracy and reliability of the results.
◦ Controls should fall within the specified ranges provided with
the kit. If the controls do not give expected results, the test
is invalid, and the entire run must be repeated.
◦ Document all quality control results and any corrective
actions taken.
8. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
◦ The assay is considered valid if the positive control gives a
higher absorbance than the negative control and if the
negative control gives an absorbance value lower than the
cut-off value.
◦ Determine the cut-off value as per the kit instructions.
◦ Results interpretation:
▪ Negative: Absorbance value < Cut-off value
▪ Positive: Absorbance value ≥ Cut-off value
◦ Report the results clearly as "HDV Total Antibodies:
Positive" or "HDV Total Antibodies: Negative".
9. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ Verify results and enter them into the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
◦ Critical values should be reported to the requesting
physician immediately following laboratory protocol.
10. SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS
◦ Follow universal precautions when handling serum samples.
◦ Dispose of all biohazardous waste as per the laboratory’s
waste management protocols.
◦ Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE).
