Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase of Generating Results for Hepatitis E Virus IgG
Antibody, Serum
1. PURPOSE To outline the procedure for the detection and
quantification of Hepatitis E Virus (HEV) IgG antibodies in
serum samples using the designated immunoassay method in
the clinical laboratory.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory technologists are responsible
for performing the analysis of HEV IgG antibody tests accurately
according to this SOP. Ensuring proper quality control and managing
any abnormalities is the responsibility of all laboratory personnel
involved in specimen testing.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS Acceptable Specimen:
• Serum collected in a plain red-top or serum separator tube (SST).
• Volume: Minimum of 1 mL of serum is required for the test.
• Stability requirements: Specimens should be analyzed within 48
hours if stored at 2-8°C. For longer storage needs, freeze at
-20°C or colder.
• Specimens should be free of hemolysis, lipemia, and microbial
contamination.
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Serum with severe hemolysis, lipemia or contamination.
• Specimens not properly labeled or without patient identification
details.
• Specimens stored beyond stability limits.
1. MATERIALS AND REAGENTS
• HEV IgG detection kit (manufacturer specified)
• Calibrators and controls as specified by the kit's instructions
• Micropipettes
• Disposable pipette tips
• Centrifuge
• Refrigeration and freezing equipment
• Vortex mixer
• Tube racks
1. EQUIPMENT
• Immunoassay analyzer (instrument model specified by the
manufacturer)
• Refrigerator (2-8°C)
• Freezer (-20°C or colder)
• Computer with Laboratory Information System (LIS)
• Timer
1. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation:
1. Ensure serum specimens are properly labeled and stored.
2. If serum was frozen, thaw at room temperature or 2-8°C before
analysis.
3. Mix serum specimens gently but thoroughly using a vortex
mixer.
B. Calibration and Quality Control:
1. Perform calibration of the analyzer using the calibrators
provided in the HEV IgG kit per manufacturer instructions.
2. Run quality control samples (positive and negative controls) to
ensure the system is functioning correctly.
3. Validate that the control results fall within acceptable ranges
before proceeding with patient specimens.
C. Assay Procedure:
1. Load patient serum samples, calibrators, and controls onto the
immunoassay analyzer as per the manufacturer's guidelines.
2. Follow the specific steps indicated in the kit's protocol including
incubation times, washing cycles, and measurement settings.
3. Start the assay run on the analyzer and monitor the progress
and status for any alerts or issues.
D. Data Analysis and Reporting:
1. Review the assay's output data on the analyzer and confirm the
results of each specimen.
2. Verify that all control and calibration results are within
acceptable limits.
3. Use LIS to record functional results correlating with the
analytical data from the analyzer.
4. Report patient results through LIS and ensure all critical values
are promptly communicated according to laboratory policy.
E. Troubleshooting:
1. If internal quality control fails, do not proceed with testing
patient samples. Repeat quality control tests and investigate
reasons for failure.
2. If a sample demonstrates unexpected results or interference,
repeat the test with a fresh aliquot.
3. Consult the supervisor or manufacturer’s technical support for
persistent issues that cannot be resolved within the lab.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
• Maintain logs of daily quality control results including calibrations.
• Ensure documentation of any corrective action taken if QC values
are out of range.
1. SAFETY AND COMPLIANCE
• Follow biosafety and laboratory safety guidelines, such as
wearing PPE and handling biohazardous substances
appropriately.
• Comply with manufacturer's instructions and allergen safety
protocols.
1. DOCUMENTATION AND RECORD KEEPING
• Record all assay data, QC logs, calibrations, and run
documentation in the designated logs.
• Ensure proper management of patient results including timely
verification and correction of any discrepancies.
