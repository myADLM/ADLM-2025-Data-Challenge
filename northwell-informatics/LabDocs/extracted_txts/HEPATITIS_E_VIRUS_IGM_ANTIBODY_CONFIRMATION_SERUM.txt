Standard Operating Procedure Title: Confirmation of Hepatitis E
Virus IgM Antibody, Serum
1. PURPOSE: To outline the procedure for confirming the presence
of Hepatitis E Virus (HEV) IgM antibodies in serum samples using
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
Responsibility: Designated laboratory staff will perform the HEV IgM
antibody confirmation testing as per this procedure and document the
results. Supervisors are responsible for ensuring the entire process
adheres to defined protocols.
2. SPECIMEN:
a. Preferred/Acceptable Specimen:
• Serum specimen collected in a gold-top serum separator tube
(SST) or red-top tube without anticoagulant.
• Minimum volume required is 0.5 mL.
b. Unacceptable Specimen:
• Specimens collected in anticoagulant tubes (e.g., EDTA, heparin).
• Hemolyzed or lipemic specimens.
• Specimens arriving at the laboratory more than 72 hours after
collection without refrigeration.
• Specimens with missing or incorrect patient identification.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES:
• HEV IgM ELISA kit (including test wells, conjugate, substrate, and
stop solution)
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Microplate reader capable of measuring absorbance at 450 nm
• Incubator set to 37°C
• Plate washer or manual washing equipment
• Timer
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
4. PROCEDURE:
Preparation:
• Allow all reagents and samples to come to room temperature
before testing.
• Ensure all equipment is calibrated and functioning correctly before
starting the procedure.
Testing Process:
1. Sample Preparation:
◦ Centrifuge the serum separator tube at 1500 x g for 10
minutes to obtain clear serum.
◦ Transfer at least 0.5 mL of the serum to a properly labeled
secondary container.
2. Assaying:
◦ Prepare the ELISA plate according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Mark the wells designated for standards,
controls, and patient samples.
◦ Add 100 µL of the provided capture antibody solution to
each well and incubate at 37°C for 30 minutes.
◦ Wash the plate 3 times with wash buffer.
◦ Add 100 µL of serum sample (or controls/standards) to
designated wells.
◦ Incubate at 37°C for 45 minutes.
◦ Wash the plate 3 times.
◦ Add 100 µL of conjugate solution to each well and incubate
at 37°C for 30 minutes.
◦ Wash the plate 3 times.
◦ Add 100 µL of substrate solution to each well. Incubate at
room temperature (20-25°C) for 15 minutes in the dark.
◦ Add 50 µL of stop solution to each well.
3. Reading and Interpreting Results:
◦ Measure the absorbance of each well at 450 nm using the
microplate reader.
◦ Compare the results against established standards and
controls provided in the kit.
◦ Calculate and interpret results according to the
manufacturer’s guidelines.
5. QUALITY CONTROL:
• Run internal positive and negative controls with each batch of
tests.
• Document all controls and standards in the log.
• Re-run any test batch where controls do not fall within the
expected range.
6. REPORTING RESULTS:
• Enter the results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS) for
review and verification.
• Confirmatory positive results for HEV IgM antibodies should be
reviewed and verified by the technologist.
• Notify the physician of positive confirmed results according to the
critical result reporting protocol.
7. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
• Results can be affected by hemolysis or lipemia in samples.
• Unsuitable specimens (incorrectly stored or handled) may
produce invalid results.
• Follow specific recommendations in the manufacturer's insert for
additional limitations.
8. REFERENCES:
• Manufacturer’s ELISA kit insert for detailed instructions and
limitations.
• CLSI guidelines for Hepatitis E Virus IgM antibody testing.
9. REVIEW AND DOCUMENTATION:
• All results and procedural deviations must be documented.
• Periodical reviews of the SOP are mandatory to incorporate any
updates or amendments.
