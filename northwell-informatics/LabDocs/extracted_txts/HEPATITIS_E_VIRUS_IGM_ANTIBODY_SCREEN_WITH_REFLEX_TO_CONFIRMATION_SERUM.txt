Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Hepatitis E Virus IgM Antibody Screen with Reflex to
Confirmation, Serum
1. PURPOSE
To provide standard procedures for performing the analytical phase
of the Hepatitis E Virus (HEV) IgM Antibody Screen and reflex to
confirmation testing for serum samples in a CLIA-certified laboratory.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
All trained laboratory staff are responsible for performing the testing
as outlined in this SOP. It is the responsibility of supervisory staff to
ensure testing is performed in accordance with this procedure and to
address any discrepancies or issues during the testing process.
1. SPECIMEN
Specimen Type:
• Serum
Collection Information:
• Collect blood sample in a serum separator tube (SST).
• Allow the blood to clot for 30 minutes and then centrifuge at
1500-2000 x g for 10 minutes to separate serum.
• Serum specimens can be stored at 2-8°C for up to 7 days or
frozen at -20°C or lower for longer storage.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric serum samples that may interfere
with assay performance.
• Specimens not labeled with proper patient identification or
collection date/time.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Microplate reader or chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA)
analyzer
• Centrifuge
• Refrigerator and freezer for specimen storage
Reagents:
• HEV IgM Antibody ELISA or CLIA kit
• Positive and Negative controls
• Wash buffer, sample diluent, and substrate solution (specific to
the kit used)
Supplies:
• Pipettes and tips
• Microplates or reaction wells (if performing ELISA)
• Tubes for sample aliquoting
• Gloves, lab coats, and other PPE as appropriate
1. PROCEDURE
Screening Test:
1. Preparation:
◦ Bring all reagents and serum samples to room temperature
before testing.
◦ Ensure all equipment is calibrated and functioning properly.
2. Sample and Control Placement:
◦ Pipette the appropriate volume of controls and serum
samples into designated wells or reaction sites.
3. Assay Execution:
◦ Follow manufacturer’s instructions on incubation times,
temperature conditions, and wash steps.
◦ Add detection reagents (conjugates, substrates) as per the
kit instructions.
◦ Perform necessary reading steps (optical density readings
for ELISA or signal capture for CLIA).
4. Results Interpretation:
◦ Use the microplate reader or CLIA analyzer to read the
results.
◦ Compare sample readings to the established cutoff values.
◦ Determine if samples are positive or negative based on
comparison with control values.
Reflex Confirmation:
1. Positive Screening Results:
◦ For specimens that produce a positive result in the
screening test, proceed to confirmation testing.
◦ Use an alternative HEV IgM confirmation assay kit as
specified by laboratory guidelines.
2. Confirmatory Assay Steps:
◦ Perform the confirmatory assay as per manufacturer’s
instructions, ensuring adherence to incubation and wash
steps.
◦ Read and interpret results using appropriate equipment.
3. QUALITY CONTROL
Quality Control Materials:
• Run both Negative and Positive controls with each batch of
samples tested.
• Ensure all control results fall within acceptable ranges before
validating patient results.
Failure of Controls:
• If controls do not perform as expected, invalidate the run and re-
test the samples after resolving the issue.
Equipment Calibration:
• Ensure regular calibration and maintenance of all analytical
equipment as per lab guidelines and manufacturer
recommendations.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
Result Documentation:
• Record results promptly and accurately in the Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
• Ensure all critical results are reviewed and verified by a qualified
technologist.
Interpretation Comments:
• Add interpretive comments if results are outside expected ranges
or if there is interference suspected.
Notification of Critical Results:
• Communicate critical positive results to the ordering physician
immediately following lab policy.

1. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS
• Handle reagents and samples according to biosafety protocols.
• Use appropriate PPE to minimize exposure risk.
