Standard Operating Procedure for Hepatitis E Virus RNA
Detection and Quantification, Real-Time RT-PCR in Serum
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the procedures for detecting and quantifying
Hepatitis E Virus (HEV) RNA in serum samples using real-time RT-
PCR methodology. The objective is to ensure the accuracy and
precision of results generated using this assay and to maintain
compliance with CLIA regulations.
Responsibility: Lab technicians are responsible for performing the
assay according to this SOP.
Supervisors are responsible for ensuring adherence to the protocol
and resolving any procedural issues.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/Acceptable Specimen:
• 5 mL of patient serum collected in a sterile container
• Serum must be separated from whole blood and stored at -20°C
or lower until the time of analysis
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Serum from samples collected in non-sterile containers
• Samples that have been stored above -20°C
• Specimens arriving at the laboratory more than 24 hours after
collection without being frozen
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• Real-time PCR instrument (e.g., ABI Prism 7500, Roche
LightCycler 480)
• HEV-specific primers and probes
• RNA extraction kits (e.g., QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit)
• RT-PCR Master Mix (commercially available kits recommended)
• Reverse Transcriptase enzyme
• Real-time PCR consumables (tubes, plates, caps)
4. PROCEDURE
RNA Extraction:
1. Thaw serum samples on ice.
2. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for the RNA extraction
kit. Ensure use of appropriate controls to monitor extraction
efficiency.
3. Quantify extracted RNA using a spectrophotometer or
fluorometer. Record concentration.
RT-PCR Setup:
1. Prepare RT-PCR Master Mix according to manufacturer's
instructions.
2. Add extracted RNA template to each RT-PCR reaction,
ensuring proper volumes and controls (positive, negative, and
no-template controls) are included.
3. Load reactions into real-time PCR instrument.
Cycling Conditions:
1. Reverse transcription: 50°C for 15 minutes.
2. Initial denaturation: 95°C for 10 minutes.
3. Cycling (45 cycles):
◦ Denaturation: 95°C for 15 seconds.
◦ Annealing/Extension: 60°C for 60 seconds.
Notes:
• Ensure minimal light exposure of probes to maintain fluorophore
integrity.
• Adhere strictly to cycle parameters per kit instructions.
5. CALCULATIONS AND INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
• Automated calculation of Ct values will be performed by the real-
time PCR software.
• Quantification will be based on a standard curve generated using
known concentrations of HEV RNA.
• Ct values are inversely related to the amount of starting HEV
RNA; lower Ct values indicate higher RNA concentration.
Reference Intervals and Reporting:
• HEV RNA Quantification should be reported in IU/mL.
• Negatives are indicated by absence of amplification within 45
cycles.
• Document results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
promptly.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run quality controls at the beginning of each batch of assays,
including positive and negative controls to ensure the accuracy of
the results.
• Verify each new lot of reagents and primers/probes with
appropriate validation experiments.
• Document QC results and investigate any out-of-range values
according to lab-specific guidelines.
7. ANOMALIES AND TROUBLESHOOTING
• If results are inconsistent, review the RNA extraction step, ensure
primer/probe integrity, and confirm RT-PCR instrument calibration.
• Any observed deviations or unexpected results should be
documented and resolved through supervisor consultation,
following established troubleshooting protocols.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• False negatives or positives may occur due to RNA degradation,
improper sample storage, or contamination.
• Ensure strict adherence to specimen handling and preparation
guidelines to mitigate these risks.
9. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's instructions for RNA extraction and RT-PCR kits.
• Peer-reviewed literature on HEV real-time RT-PCR
methodologies.
• Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines for
molecular diagnostics.
