Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Analytical Phase for
Hepatitis Panel, Acute
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedures for the analytical
phase of the Hepatitis Panel, Acute. This includes the steps for
performing the tests, handling results, and ensuring quality control for
the detection of hepatitis A, B, and C markers in patient specimens.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing the
tests, documenting the results, and adhering to the quality control
procedures. All personnel must ensure accurate and timely
processing of the Hepatitis Panel, Acute.
2. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
• Centrifuge
• Incubators
• Micropipettes and pipette tips
• Vortex mixer
• Standard laboratory PPE (gloves, lab coat, safety goggles)
• ELISA reader or chemiluminescence analyzer
• Hepatitis panel assay kits (e.g., ELISA or chemiluminescence kits
for HBsAg, anti-HBs, anti-HBc, IgM anti-HAV, anti-HCV)
• Refrigerators for reagent storage
• Distilled water and wash buffers
• Quality control materials (e.g., positive and negative controls)
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen Type:
• Serum or plasma Collection Tubes:
• Serum separator tubes (SST) or plasma tubes containing EDTA,
heparin, or citrate
Handling and Storage:
• Centrifuge specimens to separate serum or plasma within 2 hours
of collection.
• If testing is not performed immediately, samples should be stored
at 2-8°C and tested within 7 days. For longer storage, freeze
samples at -20°C or lower for up to 6 months.
• Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples
• Specimens collected in unsuitable anticoagulant tubes
4. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation:
1. Ensure all equipment is calibrated and functioning properly.
2. Thaw frozen specimens at room temperature and mix gently
before testing.
3. Set up the ELISA reader or chemiluminescence analyzer
according to the manufacturer's instructions.
B) Running the Assay:
For ELISA:
1. Label the appropriate number of microplate wells and controls.
2. Pipette the required volume of controls, standards, and patient
samples into the wells according to the kit instructions.
3. Add the appropriate reagents, including conjugates and
substrates, as specified in the kit insert.
4. Incubate the microplate at the specified temperature for the
recommended time.
5. Wash the wells thoroughly using wash buffer to remove
unbound substances.
6. Add the substrate solution and incubate again for the specified
time.
7. Stop the reaction by adding the stop solution.
8. Measure the absorbance of each well at the appropriate
wavelength using the ELISA reader.
For Chemiluminescence:
1. Prepare the analyzer and reagents according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Load the control and patient specimens into the analyzer.
3. Program the analyzer with the required assay protocol.
4. Initiate the run and allow the analyzer to process the samples.
5. Record the results as displayed by the analyzer.
5. QUALITY CONTROL AND CALIBRATION
• Run positive and negative controls with each batch of tests.
• Ensure calibration is performed as required by the manufacturer’s
guidelines.
• Verify control results are within acceptable limits before reporting
patient results.
• If controls do not meet acceptable criteria, recalibrate the
instrument, and/or prepare the assay again before retesting
patient specimens.
6. INTERPRETATION AND REPORTING OF RESULTS
• Results should be interpreted according to the criteria provided in
the assay kit insert.
• Report results as positive, negative, or indeterminate for each
marker (HBsAg, anti-HBs, anti-HBc, IgM anti-HAV, anti-HCV).
• All indeterminate results should be repeated; if still indeterminate,
refer to a pathologist or clinical microbiologist for further
recommendations.
• Ensure all critical results are communicated to the requesting
physician immediately.
7. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Hepatitis B Surface Antigen (HBsAg): Negative
• Anti-Hepatitis B Surface Antibody (anti-HBs): Non-reactive
• Anti-Hepatitis B Core Antibody (anti-HBc): Negative
• IgM Anti-Hepatitis A Virus (IgM anti-HAV): Negative
• Anti-Hepatitis C Virus (anti-HCV): Non-reactive
8. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If unexpected results are obtained, verify the integrity of reagents
and controls.
• Ensure that the correct volumes were added and that incubation
times/temperatures were adhered to.
• Consult the assay kit insert and/or technical support for the assay
manufacturer if persistent issues arise.
9. DOCUMENTATION AND RECORD KEEPING
• Record all results, including quality control data, in the laboratory
information system (LIS).
• Ensure all raw data, printouts, and instrument logs are retained as
per laboratory and regulatory guidelines.
• Document any deviations from protocol and corrective actions
taken.
References:
• Manufacturer’s instructions for ELISA or chemiluminescence kits
used.
• Relevant clinical laboratory standards (e.g., CLIA guidelines).
Note: Ensure that all SOPs are reviewed and updated regularly to
comply with current best practices and regulatory requirements. This
SOP is effective as of the last review date: [Date].
