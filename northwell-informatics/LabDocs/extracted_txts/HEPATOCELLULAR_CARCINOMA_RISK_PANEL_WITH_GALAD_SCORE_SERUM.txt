Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Hepatocellular Carcinoma
Risk Panel with GALAD Score, Serum
1. PURPOSE This SOP outlines the procedure for the analytical
phase of generating results for the Hepatocellular Carcinoma
(HCC) Risk Panel with GALAD Score in serum samples. The
aim is to ensure accurate, reliable, and timely results to aid in
the diagnosis and risk assessment of hepatocellular carcinoma.
2. SCOPE This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel
responsible for performing the HCC Risk Panel with GALAD
Score analysis on serum samples in a CLIA-certified laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY It is the responsibility of all designated
laboratory personnel to follow this SOP to ensure the integrity
and accuracy of test results.
4. DEFINITIONS
• Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC): A primary malignancy of the
liver.
• GALAD Score: A biomarker-based score combining gender, age,
AFP (alpha-fetoprotein), DCP (des-gamma-carboxy prothrombin),
and AFP-L3.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Serum
• Collection: Specimens should be collected in a serum separator
tube (SST).
• Volume: Minimum volume 1 mL of serum.
• Stability: Serum samples should be processed and analyzed
within 48 hours of collection. If delayed, serum can be stored at
2-8°C for up to 72 hours or frozen at -20°C for up to 30 days.
• Unacceptable Specimens: Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Centrifuge
• Serum separator tubes (SST)
• Calibrated pipettes and tips
• Control materials (Commercially prepared controls for AFP, DCP,
and AFP-L3)
• Automated immunoassay analyzer
• GALAD calculation software or validated alternate method
• Laboratory Information System (LIS)
1. PROCEDURE A. Pre-analytical Phase
2. Verify the specimen has been properly collected, labeled, and
accessioned.
3. Centrifuge the SST at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes to separate
serum.
4. Inspect serum for any signs of hemolysis, lipemia, or icterus.
Reject unsuitable specimens.
B. Analytical Phase
1. Prepare the analyzer:
◦ Perform daily maintenance and calibration as per
manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Load appropriate reagents and ensure they are within expiry
dates.
2. Testing
◦ Program the analyzer according to the manufacturer’s
protocol.
◦ Pipette the appropriate volume of serum into the sample
wells or vials as required.
◦ Initiate the testing process and ensure the analyzer runs
without interruptions.
3. Controls and Calibration
◦ Run quality control samples before patient samples. Ensure
controls fall within the acceptable range.
◦ If controls are outside the acceptable range, troubleshoot
per the manufacturer’s instructions before proceeding.
4. Quality Assurance
◦ Ensure internal quality controls are within acceptable limits.
◦ Participate in external proficiency testing as available.
C. Post-analytical Phase
1. Verification:
◦ Review results for accuracy. Verify that QC samples are
within range and patient results fall within assay ranges.
◦ Calculate the GALAD score using the validated GALAD
calculation software or a validated formula: GALAD Score =
-10.08 + 0.09 × Age + 1.67 × (Gender factor) + 2.34 ×
log10(AFP) + 0.04 × AFP-L3% + 1.33 × log10(DCP)
(Gender factor: 1 if female, 0 if male)
2. Reporting:
◦ Enter verified results into the LIS.
◦ Results include individual assay measurements, the
calculated GALAD score, and an interpretive comment on
the HCC risk.
3. Interpretation and Follow-up:
◦ Provide interpretive comments based on the GALAD score.
◦ Refer any critical or unusual results to the supervising
pathologist for further review.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform internal quality control for each run using commercially
prepared control materials.
• Participate in external proficiency testing as required by regulatory
and accrediting bodies.
1. RECORDS AND DOCUMENTATION
• Maintain records of all instrument calibrations, daily maintenance,
QC results, and patient test results.
• Document any deviations, corrective actions, and troubleshooting
performed during the analytical phase.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING
• Follow the troubleshooting guide provided by the instrument
manufacturer.
• Consult the supervisor or technical support if issues cannot be
resolved promptly.
1. REFERENCES AND RELATED DOCUMENTS
• Manufacturer’s instrument manual and reagent inserts.
• Laboratory Quality Management System procedures.
• Relevant clinical guidelines and literature on GALAD score
interpretation and HCC diagnosis.
