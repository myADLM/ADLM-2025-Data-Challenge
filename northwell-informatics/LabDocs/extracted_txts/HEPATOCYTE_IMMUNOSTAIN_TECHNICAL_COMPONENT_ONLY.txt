Hepatocyte Immunostain, Technical Component Only
1. PURPOSE
To provide standardized procedures for performing hepatocyte
immunostaining for detecting specific antigens in liver tissue
samples, ensuring consistency, accuracy, and reliability of results
within the laboratory.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory technologists are responsible for
performing the immunostaining procedure.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring that the procedure is
carried out and documented accurately.
1. SPECIMEN
Preferred/Acceptable:
• Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded liver tissue blocks.
• Unstained tissue sections mounted on positively charged slides.
Unacceptable:
• Tissue sections that are not properly fixed or processed.
• Slides with incomplete case identification or poor tissue
adherence.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Microtome.
• Water bath.
• Slide warmer.
• Automated or manual immunostainer.
• Light microscope.
Reagents:
• Primary antibody specific for hepatocyte antigen.
• Secondary antibody.
• DAB (3,3'-diaminobenzidine) substrate.
• Hematoxylin counterstain.
• Mounting medium.
Supplies:
• Positively charged slides.
• Coverslips.
• Staining jars or automated stainer containers.
• Disposable gloves.
• Absorbent pads.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Slide Preparation:
1. Cut 3-4 µm sections from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded
tissue blocks using a microtome.
2. Float sections on a water bath at 40-45°C to flatten and pick up
on positively charged slides.
3. Air dry slides at room temperature for at least 30 minutes.
4. Bake slides at 60°C for 1 hour to ensure proper adhesion.
B. Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
1. Deparaffinize slides by immersing in xylene for 10 minutes (2
changes).
2. Rehydrate slides through graded ethanol (100%, 95%, 70%) for
5 minutes each.
3. Rinse slides in distilled water for 5 minutes.
C. Antigen Retrieval:
1. Place slides in a retrieval buffer (e.g., citrate buffer, pH 6.0) and
heat in a microwave or a pressure cooker according to the
buffer manufacturer's protocol.
2. Allow slides to cool at room temperature for 20 minutes.
3. Rinse slides in distilled water and then in PBS (phosphate-
buffered saline).
D. Immunostaining:
1. Apply blocking solution to slides to prevent non-specific binding
and incubate according to the reagent manufacturer's protocol.
2. Incubate slides with the primary antibody specific to the
hepatocyte antigen in a humidifying chamber for the time
specified by the antibody datasheet (typically 1-2 hours at room
temperature or overnight at 4°C).
3. Wash slides in PBS 3 times for 5 minutes each.
4. Incubate slides with a secondary antibody conjugated with a
detection enzyme (e.g., horseradish peroxidase) for 30-60
minutes at room temperature.
5. Wash slides in PBS 3 times for 5 minutes each.
6. Apply DAB substrate solution, incubate until the desired
staining intensity is achieved (typically 5-10 minutes).
7. Rinse slides in distilled water.
E. Counterstaining and Mounting:
1. Counterstain slides with hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes.
2. Rinse in tap water and then in distilled water.
3. Dehydrate sections through graded ethanol (70%, 95%, 100%).
4. Clear slides in xylene and mount using a synthetic mounting
medium.
5. Apply coverslips.
F. Quality Control:
1. Include positive and negative controls for each staining run.
2. Ensure that the positive control exhibits expected staining and
the negative control shows no staining.
3. REPORTING RESULTS
As this procedure is for the technical component only, the stained
slides will be passed on to the appropriate pathologist for
interpretation. The pathologist will document the findings in the
patient's medical record following the institution's reporting
guidelines. Ensure the slides are labeled correctly, and the staining
results are documented in the laboratory information system.
1. MAINTENANCE AND TROUBLESHOOTING
Routine Maintenance:
• Regularly clean and calibrate the microtome and staining
equipment as per the manufacturers' guidelines.
• Ensure solution containers are clean and reagents are not
expired.
Troubleshooting:
• If staining intensity is suboptimal, ensure proper rehydration and
thorough washing steps.
• Verify that antibodies and detection reagents are stored and used
correctly.
• Document and address any technical issues encountered and
notify the supervisor if they persist.
