STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase Protocol for Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 1 Beta
Immunostain, Technical Component Only
Effective Date: [Insert Date]
Approval: [Lab Director’s Name/Title]
Review Date: [Insert Date]
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the technical component of
the Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 1 Beta (HNF1β) Immunostain. This
procedure aims to ensure accurate and consistent preparation and
staining of tissue sections for HNF1β to aid in diagnosis.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel performing the technical
preparation and staining for HNF1β immunostains in a CLIA-certified
laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Designated histotechnologists are responsible for performing the
immunostaining procedure as outlined in this protocol.
• Supervisors are responsible for training staff, ensuring adherence
to the protocol, and addressing any procedural issues.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND PREPARATION
4.1. Specimen Type: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue
sections. 4.2. Slide Preparation:
• Tissue sections should be cut at 4-5 microns.
• Sections should be mounted on positively charged slides.
• Slides must be baked at 60°C for at least 1 hour or overnight to
ensure tissue adherence.
5. REAGENTS AND EQUIPMENT
5.1. Reagents:
• Primary antibody: Anti-Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 1 Beta
(HNF1β).
• Secondary antibody: Appropriate biotinylated secondary antibody.
• Detection system: ABC (Avidin-Biotin Complex) or Polymer-based
detection system.
• DAB (3,3’-Diaminobenzidine) substrate.
• Counterstain: Hematoxylin.
• Buffer solutions: Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or Tris-buffered
saline (TBS).
5.2. Equipment:
• Automated immunostainer (if applicable) or manual staining
setup.
• Water bath set at 95-100°C for antigen retrieval.
• Humidity chamber for incubation steps.
• Light microscope for quality control.
6. PROCEDURE
6.1. Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
1. Place slides in xylene for 2x5 minutes.
2. Transfer slides through decreasing concentrations of ethanol
(100%, 95%, 70%) for 2 minutes each.
3. Rinse slides in distilled water.
6.2. Antigen Retrieval:
1. Heat-induced epitope retrieval (HIER) using citrate buffer (pH
6.0) in a water bath or microwave at 95-100°C for 20 minutes.
2. Allow slides to cool for 20 minutes at room temperature.
3. Rinse slides in running tap water for 5 minutes and then PBS or
TBS.
6.3. Blocking:
1. Incubate slides in a blocking solution (e.g., 3% hydrogen
peroxide) for 10 minutes to quench endogenous peroxidase
activity.
2. Wash slides in PBS or TBS.
6.4. Primary Antibody Incubation:
1. Apply primary antibody (HNF1β) diluted as recommended by
the manufacturer.
2. Incubate in a humidity chamber at room temperature for 60
minutes.
3. Wash slides in PBS or TBS, 3x5 minutes.
6.5. Secondary Antibody Incubation:
1. Apply secondary biotinylated antibody.
2. Incubate in a humidity chamber at room temperature for 30
minutes.
3. Wash slides in PBS or TBS, 3x5 minutes.
6.6. Detection:
1. Apply ABC complex or Polymer-based detection system.
2. Incubate according to manufacturer’s recommendations.
3. Wash slides in PBS or TBS, 3x5 minutes.
6.7. Chromogen Development:
1. Apply DAB substrate and incubate until the desired staining
intensity is achieved (typically 5-10 minutes).
2. Rinse slides in distilled water to stop the reaction.
6.8. Counterstaining:
1. Immerse slides in hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes.
2. Rinse in running tap water.
3. Differentiate in 1% acid alcohol if necessary.
4. Rinse in running tap water and blue in 0.2% ammonia water.
5. Rinse in distilled water.
6.9. Dehydration and Mounting:
1. Dehydrate slides through increasing concentrations of ethanol
(70%, 95%, 100%).
2. Clear in xylene.
3. Mount with a coverslip using a suitable mounting medium.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include positive and negative controls with each staining run.
• Examine slides under a light microscope to verify the specificity
and intensity of staining.
• Document staining quality and any deviations or issues in the
logbook.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• The stained slides and controls should be sent to the pathologist
for interpretation.
• Record and report any discrepancies to the laboratory supervisor
immediately.

• Manufacturer's instructions for antibodies and detection kits.
• Laboratory's internal quality control guidelines.

11. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS
• Follow all laboratory safety protocols including the use of personal
protective equipment.
• Handle reagents and specimens with care to avoid contamination
and ensure accurate results.
