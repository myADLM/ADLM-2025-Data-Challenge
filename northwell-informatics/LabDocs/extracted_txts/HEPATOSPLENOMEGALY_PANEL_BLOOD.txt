Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for
HEPATOSPLENOMEGALY PANEL, BLOOD
1. PURPOSE: The purpose of this SOP is to outline the analytical
procedures for generating results for the Hepatosplenomegaly Panel,
Blood. This panel interprets the results of multiple tests related to
liver function, spleen health, and overall blood analysis which can
help diagnose and manage hepatosplenomegaly-related conditions.
2. RESPONSIBILITY: It is the responsibility of the laboratory
technologist/technician to perform and document the analytical
procedures according to this SOP and adhere to all quality control
measures. It is also their responsibility to report any irregularities or
unexpected results to the supervising pathologist or designated
authority.
3. DEFINITION: The Hepatosplenomegaly Panel, Blood includes a
series of tests that may vary based on the physician's request but
generally includes:
• Complete Blood Count (CBC) with Differential
• Liver Function Tests (ALT, AST, ALP, GGT, Bilirubin)
• Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH)
• Ferritin
• Total Protein and Albumin
• Coagulation Profile (PT/INR and aPTT)
• Viral Hepatitis Panel
• Autoimmune Hepatitis Panel
• Other relevant serological or biochemical markers as deemed
necessary
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES:
• Hematology analyzer for CBC
• Chemistry analyzer(s) for liver function tests, LDH, ferritin, total
protein, and albumin
• Coagulation analyzer for PT/INR and aPTT
• Special reagents for serological tests and ELISA kits for specific
markers
• Controls and calibration standards
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
• Sample collection and transport materials
5. PROCEDURE:
A) SAMPLE PREPARATION:
1. All blood samples should be handled according to laboratory
procedures ensuring they are correctly labeled and
accessioned.
2. Verify that samples are free from clots, hemolysis, and other
integrity issues before starting the analysis.
B) COMPLETE BLOOD COUNT (CBC) WITH DIFFERENTIAL:
1. Load the whole blood sample into the hematology analyzer.
2. Ensure the instrument has been calibrated and undergone
routine quality controls.
3. Start the analysis and review the results.
4. Document and verify results including WBC, RBC, HGB, HCT,
MCV, MCH, MCHC, RDW, Platelets, and a detailed differential
count.
C) LIVER FUNCTION TESTS:
1. Centrifuge the sample if required to segregate plasma or
serum.
2. Load the sample into the chemistry analyzer.
3. Run the tests for ALT, AST, ALP, GGT, total bilirubin, and direct
bilirubin.
4. Review the data according to reference intervals provided and
subject to quality control checks.
D) LACTATE DEHYDROGENASE (LDH), FERRITIN, TOTAL
PROTEIN, AND ALBUMIN:
1. Ensure the specimen is properly prepared and sample volumes
meet the analyzer requirements.
2. Perform the LDH, ferritin, total protein, and albumin assays on
the chemistry analyzer.
3. Validate the results using appropriate reference ranges.
E) COAGULATION PROFILE (PT/INR AND aPTT):
1. Centrifuge the whole blood sample suitably for plasma
separation.
2. Calibrate and perform quality control runs on the coagulation
analyzer.
3. Run the PT/INR and aPTT tests and cross-check results
against standard coagulation profiles.
F) VIRAL HEPATITIS PANEL:
1. Carry out the Hepatitis A, B, C serology panels using ELISA kits
or automated platforms as appropriate.
2. Follow manufacturer's instructions and ensure proper
incubation and washing steps are adhered to.
3. Record and verify results.
G) AUTOIMMUNE HEPATITIS PANEL:
1. Using commercial ELISA kits or other serological methods,
identify antibodies specific to autoimmune hepatitis.
2. Ensure controls and standards are within acceptable limits
during the run.
3. Analyze and interpret results according to predefined criteria.
6. QUALITY CONTROL:
1. Control material at different levels (high, medium, low) should
be used to check the accuracy and precision of all analyzers.
2. Document all quality control runs and take corrective actions if
controls fall out of acceptable ranges.
3. Perform instrument calibration and preventive maintenance as
recommended by the manufacturer.
7. REPORTING RESULTS:
1. Results should be verified by the laboratory technologist and
reviewed by the supervising pathologist.
2. Enter verified results into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS) ensuring accurate transcription.
3. Flag and report critical results to the referring physician
immediately using the laboratory's protocol for urgent findings.
8. SAMPLE INTEGRITY AND STORAGE:
1. Store the samples as per guidelines post-analysis in case
repeat or additional tests are needed.
2. Dispose of samples and laboratory waste as per the biomedical
waste management protocols.
9. REFERENCES:
• Manufacturer’s instruction manuals for hematology and chemistry
analyzers.
• ELISA kit inserts for serological and autoimmune hepatitis panels.
• Laboratory Quality Management System (QMS) manuals for
quality control protocols.
10. REVIEW AND DOCUMENT CONTROL: This SOP should be
reviewed annually or when there is a change in practice, equipment,
or standards. Update and document changes as necessary and
ensure all relevant staff are trained on new protocols.
