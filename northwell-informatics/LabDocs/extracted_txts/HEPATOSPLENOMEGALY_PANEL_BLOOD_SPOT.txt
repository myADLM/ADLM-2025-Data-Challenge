Standard Operating Procedure Analytical Phase - Generating Results
for Hepatosplenomegaly Panel, Blood Spot
1. PURPOSE
This procedure outlines the steps to be followed for the analytical
phase of the Hepatosplenomegaly Panel, Blood Spot, ensuring
accurate and reliable results.
1. SCOPE
This protocol applies to all trained laboratory personnel responsible
for performing the Hepatosplenomegaly Panel, Blood Spot testing.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all designated laboratory staff to follow this
SOP and ensure that all required steps are completed accurately and
in a timely manner. Supervisors are responsible for verifying the
accuracy of results and adherence to the protocol.
1. SPECIMEN
4.1 Acceptable Specimens: - Dried blood spot on a standard
collection card. - Blood spots should be properly dried and collected
on specialized filter paper. - Blood spots should be approximately 13
mm in diameter, fully soaked but not over-saturated.
4.2 Unacceptable Specimens: - Partially filled or damaged dried
blood spot cards. - Blood spots that are contaminated, clotted,
layered, or not dried properly.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
5.1 Equipment: - Puncher for cutting out a fixed size disc from the
blood spot. - Tandem mass spectrometer (MS/MS). - HPLC system (if
needed for confirmatory tests). - Centrifuge. - Pipettes and
micropipettes.
5.2 Reagents: - Extraction buffer. - Internal standards. - Quality
control materials; negative and positive controls. - Mobile phase
solvents for HPLC (if needed).
5.3 Supplies: - Gloves and lab coats. - 96-well plates or suitable
container for the extracted samples. - Microcentrifuge tubes. - Dried
blood spot cards.
1. PROCEDURE
6.1 Pre-Analytical Preparation: - Verify that the blood spot cards are
properly labeled and trackable. - Check for the integrity of the blood
spots and ensure they meet the size and quality criteria. - Allow blood
spots to reach room temperature before analysis.
6.2 Sample Preparation: - Using a puncher, excise a standardized
disc (approximately 3 mm in diameter) from the centered area of
each blood spot. - Place the punched disc into a well of a 96-well
plate or microcentrifuge tube. - Add a predefined volume of extraction
buffer and internal standard to each well/tube. - Vortex gently to
ensure thorough mixing. - Incubate the plate/tubes at specified
conditions (e.g., 37°C for 1 hour) to allow for optimal extraction.
6.3 Sample Analysis: - Transfer an aliquot of the extracted sample to
the MS/MS system for analysis. - Ensure MS/MS is calibrated and
perform a system suitability test using quality control samples. - Run
the samples alongside negative and positive quality controls to
ensure accuracy of the run. - Identify and quantify target analytes
using predefined MS/MS detection parameters.
6.4 Post-Analytical Steps: - Review the data for each sample and
verify against expected reference ranges and quality control results. -
Apply necessary data normalization and corrections based on the
internal standards. - Repeat any samples that yield questionable or
unexpected results. This can involve re-extraction and re-analysis.
6.5 Data Interpretation and Result Generation: - Compare patient
results to established reference intervals for the Hepatosplenomegaly
panel. - Confirm that all quality control materials fall within the
acceptable ranges. - Enter results into the Laboratory Information
System (LIS) or designated reporting system. - Verify and validate
test results according to laboratory policy before release.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
7.1 Quality Control Measures: - Utilize control materials with each
batch of samples tested. - Ensure instruments are calibrated and
maintained according to manufacturer’s recommendations. -
Document all observations and corrective actions taken throughout
the procedure.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
8.1 Result Entry: - Ensure accurate and complete entry of results into
the LIS. - Apply any relevant comments or footnotes regarding
sample integrity or testing anomalies.
8.2 Result Verification: - Supervisors or designated verifying
personnel must cross-check results for accuracy. - Only validated
results should be released to the ordering physician or relevant
healthcare provider.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Each analyte in the Hepatosplenomegaly panel has specific
reference intervals based on population studies, which should be
applied accordingly when interpreting the results.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Results depend on adequate and proper collection of the dried blood
spot. False results may arise due to poor sample integrity, handling
errors, or assay anomalies. Refer to the specific reagent and
equipment manuals for individual limitations.

1. DOCUMENTATION
All procedures, calibrations, quality control, and results must be
documented accurately in the laboratory record-keeping system.
By following this SOP, laboratory personnel can ensure the reliable
and accurate generation of results for the Hepatosplenomegaly Panel
from blood spots.
