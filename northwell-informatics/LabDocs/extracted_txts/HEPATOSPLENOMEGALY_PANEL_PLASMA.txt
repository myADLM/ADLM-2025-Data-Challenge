Standard Operating Procedure
HEPATOSPLENOMEGALY PANEL, PLASMA
1. PURPOSE
To establish a standardized procedure for the analytical phase of the
Hepatosplenomegaly (HSM) Panel, Plasma, ensuring consistent and
accurate measurements for all relevant biomarkers.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory staff engaged in the analytical
testing of plasma specimens for the Hepatosplenomegaly (HSM)
Panel.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the laboratory technologists to perform the
test following the detailed procedure correctly, and ensure quality
results. Supervisors are responsible for ensuring staff are well-trained
and compliant with the SOP.
4. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
• Centrifuge
• Refrigerated plasma storage unit
• Analytical instruments specific to each biomarker (e.g., ELISA
plate reader, Immunoassay analyzer, HPLC, Mass Spectrometer,
etc.)
• Micropipettes and pipette tips
• Quality control materials
• Sample diluents and buffers
• Assay specific reagents and kits
• 24-hour refrigerated water bath/incubator
• Logbooks for temperature and quality control records
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENT
• Preferred/acceptable:
◦ 5 mL plasma collected in EDTA or heparinized tube.
◦ Specimens must be processed within 2 hours of collection.
◦ Plasma should be aliquoted into appropriate tubes and stored
at ≤ -20°C until analysis.
• Unacceptable:
◦ Specimens with hemolysis.
◦ Grossly lipemic or icteric specimens.
◦ Specimens received beyond 2 hours of collection without
proper storage.
6. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation and Setup:
1. Ensure all equipment is calibrated and operational.
2. Verify the integrity of reagents, kits, and instruments used for
the HSM Panel.
3. Thaw plasma samples completely at 4°C, then bring to room
temperature before analysis.
4. Mix thoroughly but gently to avoid hemolysis.
B) Analytical Procedure:
1. HPLC/LC-MS Analysis (For specific metabolites):
◦ Inject appropriate volume of plasma sample into the HPLC/
LC-MS system.
◦ Set the column and detector parameters as per the assay-
specific guidelines.
◦ Analyze the sample and process the data using the
system’s software.
2. ELISA/Immunoassays (For specific proteins/biomarkers):
◦ Prepare the plate as per the manufacturer's instructions.
◦ Add standards, controls, and samples to the wells in
duplicates.
◦ Perform incubations, washes, and substrate additions as
per the kit insert.
◦ Read the absorbance at the specified wavelength using an
ELISA plate reader.
3. Enzyme Activity Assays:
◦ Prepare reaction mixtures according to assay protocol.
◦ Incubate plasma samples with enzyme substrates under
specific conditions.
◦ Read the absorbance or fluorescence at specified intervals.
C) Data Analysis and Result Calculation:
1. Compile raw data from different assays for each plasma
sample.
2. Calculate concentrations of biomarkers using the calibration
curves created with the standards.
3. Compare results against quality control samples and reference
ranges.
D) Quality Control:
1. Include at least two levels of controls (low and high) in each
run.
2. Document all QC results in the logbook.
3. If QC is out of range, investigate and repeat the assays until
QC criteria are met.
4. Adhere to the assay-specific QC rejection rules and
troubleshooting guidelines.
E) Reporting Results:
1. Review all results for consistency and compliance with
expected ranges.
2. Record findings in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
3. Include pathology comments if abnormal results are observed.
4. Prioritize critical result communication according to established
guidelines.
7. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Reference ranges for each biomarker in the HSM Panel are
specified in the manufacturer’s insert or the laboratory’s reference
interval documentation.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to each individual assay's procedure and product insert for
detailed limitations.
9. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions for each specific assay reagent kit.
• Laboratory calibration and maintenance records.
• Relevant clinical pathology textbooks and peer-reviewed journals.
10. REVIEW
This protocol must be reviewed yearly or as needed based on
updates to clinical guidelines, instruments or assay kits.
