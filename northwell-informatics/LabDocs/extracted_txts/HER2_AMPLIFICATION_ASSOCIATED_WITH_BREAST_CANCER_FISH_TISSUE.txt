Standard Operating Procedure HER2 Amplification Associated with
Breast Cancer, FISH, Tissue
1. PURPOSE To outline the procedure for detecting HER2
(ERBB2) amplification in breast cancer tissue using
Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH). This analysis is vital
for identifying patients who may benefit from targeted therapies.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory staff are responsible for
conducting the HER2 FISH procedure per this SOP. Supervisors
must ensure that all staff involved are adequately trained and adhere
to the protocol.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENT Acceptable Specimen:
• Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) breast cancer tissue
block.
• Unstained paraffin sections (4-5 microns thick) mounted on
positively charged slides.
• A minimum of 2 unstained slides per case.
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Specimens that are overly dehydrated or improperly fixed.
• Slides with significant tissue folds or lacking sufficient tumor area.
• Damaged or broken slides.
1. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• HER2/CEP17 dual-color probe, commercially available.
• Pretreatment reagents, Protease digestion enzyme.
• FISH buffer solutions.
• Fluorescent mounting medium with antifade properties.
• DAPI counterstain.
• Hybridization chamber and water bath.
1. EQUIPMENT
• Fluorescence microscope with appropriate filters, capable of
visualizing fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) and Texas Red or
equivalent fluorochromes.
• Hybridization oven/incubator.
• Slide warmer.
• Microtome for sectioning FFPE blocks.
1. PROCEDURE A. Pre-treatment
• Deparaffinize tissue sections in xylene for 2 x 10-minute cycles.
• Rehydrate sections through 100%, 85%, and 70% ethanol for 2
minutes each.
• Rinse slides in distilled water.
B. Digestion
• Immerse slides in the prewarmed pretreatment solution and
incubate at 95°C for 10 minutes.
• Follow with protease digestion at 37°C for a time period based on
tissue type (typically 10-15 minutes for breast tissue).
• Rinse slides in distilled water and then in 2X SSC buffer.
C. Denaturation and Hybridization
• Apply 10 µL of HER2/CEP17 dual-color probe to each tissue
section.
• Cover with a coverslip and seal with rubber cement.
• Perform denaturation at 75°C for 5 minutes on a slide warmer.
• Hybridize in a humidified chamber at 37°C for 12-16 hours
(overnight) in the incubator.
D. Post-Hybridization Wash
• Remove coverslip carefully and immerse slides in 2X SSC/0.3%
NP-40 solution at room temperature.
• Wash slides in prewarmed stringent wash buffer at 70°C for 2
minutes.
• Air-dry the slides in the dark.
E. Counterstaining and Mounting
• Apply 10 µL of DAPI counterstain to the tissue sections.
• Cover with a large glass coverslip using antifade mounting
medium.
• Let the slides dry for at least 15 minutes protected from light.
1. ANALYSIS
• Examine the slides under a fluorescence microscope using the
appropriate filters.
• Scan the entire tissue section to determine areas with the highest
tumor cell density.
• Count the FISH signals from at least 20 nuclei in two separate
areas (total 40 nuclei).
• Calculate the HER2/CEP17 ratio and the HER2 gene copy
number per tumor nucleus.
Interpretation Guidelines:
• HER2 gene amplification is determined by: a. HER2/CEP17 ratio
≥ 2.0, or b. Average HER2 copy number ≥ 6 signals/nucleus.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Use positive and negative control tissue slides with established
HER2 amplification status for each batch of testing.
• Perform internal quality control checks, including verifying the
hybridization efficiency and signal clarity.
• Document all controls and patient tests, maintain records of each
run.
1. REPORTING RESULTS The results should be documented in
the laboratory information system (LIS) and include the
following:
• HER2/CEP17 ratio.
• Average HER2 gene copy number.
• The final interpretative result (Amplified/Non-Amplified).
• Any pre-analytical, analytical, or post-analytical issues
encountered during processing.
Ensure all results are reviewed and verified by a qualified pathologist
before release. Provide comprehensive reports with clinical
correlation and recommendations, as appropriate.
