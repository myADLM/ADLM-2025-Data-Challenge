Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) HER2 Amplification
Associated with Gastroesophageal Cancer, FISH, Tissue
1. PURPOSE To detect and evaluate HER2 gene amplification in
gastroesophageal cancer tissue samples using Fluorescence In
Situ Hybridization (FISH) technique and to generate analytically
valid results for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.
Responsibility: Designated staff including histotechnologists,
cytotechnologists, molecular technologists, and pathologists will
perform the FISH assay, interpret results, and ensure quality control
according to this procedure.
1. DEFINITION HER2 (Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor
2) gene amplification occurs when there are multiple copies of
the HER2 gene present in a cancer cell, leading to increased
expression and is associated with certain gastroesophageal
cancers.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
◦ Specimen type: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE)
tissue.
◦ Sample volume: Adequate tissue for 2-3 slides (4-5 microns
each).
Unacceptable Specimens:
◦ Tissue blocks with inadequate tumor cells.
◦ Tissue samples inadequately fixed in formalin.
◦ Samples with no labeling of patient identification.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
◦ Hybridization chamber
◦ ThermoBrite or equivalent hybridization system
◦ Fluorescence microscope
◦ HER2 FISH probe kit
◦ Fluorescently-labeled DNA probes (HER2 and CEP17)
◦ Xylene, Ethanol
◦ Deparaffinization reagents
◦ Hybridization buffer
◦ Counterstain (e.g., DAPI)
◦ Mounting medium
4. PROCEDURE Specimen Preparation:
1. Bake FFPE tissue sections at 56°C for 1 hour.
2. Deparaffinize sections in xylene (2 changes, 10 minutes
each).
3. Rehydrate slides through graded ethanol (100%, 95%,
70%, 50%) and distilled water (5 minutes each).
Pretreatment:
1. Place slides in pre-warmed pretreatment buffer and heat
at 80°C for 10 minutes.
2. Rinse slides in distilled water and then in a neutral buffer
solution.
Hybridization:
1. Apply 10 µL of HER2/CEP17 probe mix to each
specimen.
2. Cover each specimen with a coverslip and seal with
rubber cement.
3. Denature slides at 75°C for 5 minutes followed by
hybridization at 37°C for 16-20 hours in a humidified
chamber.
Post-Hybridization Wash:
1. Wash slides in 0.4X SSC/0.3% NP-40 at 73°C for 2
minutes.
2. Follow with a wash in 2X SSC/0.1% NP-40 at room
temperature for 1 minute.
Counterstaining:
1. Rinse slides briefly in distilled water.
2. Apply 10 µL of counterstain (e.g., DAPI) to each section
and coverslip.
Microscopy:
1. Examine slides under a fluorescence microscope using
an appropriate filter set.
2. Evaluate at least 20 tumor nuclei for HER2 (red signals)
and CEP17 (green signals).
5. RESULT INTERPRETATION
◦ HER2 gene amplification is defined as a HER2/CEP17 ratio
of ≥2.0.
◦ Non-amplified cases typically have a HER2/CEP17 ratio of
<2.0.
◦ Equivocal results may require additional testing or review by
a pathologist.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Run control slides with known HER2 amplified and non-
amplified samples with each batch.
◦ Ensure all equipment undergoes regular maintenance and
calibration.
◦ Document reagent lot numbers and their respective expiry
dates.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ Results are documented in the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
◦ Ensure results include HER2/CEP17 ratio, percentage of
cells with observed amplification, and overall interpretation.
◦ Provide finalized report to the requesting physician and
maintain confidentiality of patient data.
8. REFERENCE INTERVALS
◦ HER2/CEP17 ratio < 2.0: Non-amplified
◦ HER2/CEP17 ratio ≥ 2.0: Amplified
9. LIMITATIONS
◦ Artifacts or poor tissue preservation may limit assay
interpretation.
◦ Results may be influenced by the heterogeneity of tumor
samples.
◦ Testing should be correlated with clinical and pathological
findings for comprehensive interpretation.

Document Review:
• Ensure SOP is reviewed and updated annually or as needed
based on advances in technology, modification in protocol, and
regulatory updates.
