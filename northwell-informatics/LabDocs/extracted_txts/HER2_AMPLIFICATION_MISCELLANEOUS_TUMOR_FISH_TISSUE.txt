Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for HER2 Amplification,
Miscellaneous Tumor, FISH, Tissue
1. PURPOSE
To establish a standardized procedure for the detection and
quantification of HER2 gene amplification in tissue samples from
miscellaneous tumors using Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization
(FISH) technique. This protocol ensures accurate and reproducible
results essential for diagnostic and therapeutic decision-making
processes.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory staff, including medical laboratory scientists
and technologists, are responsible for performing the HER2 FISH
analysis, documenting the findings, and ensuring adherence to the
outlined protocol.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
A) Acceptable Specimens:
• Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks
• Unstained tissue sections (4-5 μm thick) mounted on positively
charged slides
B) Unacceptable Specimens:
• Fresh or frozen tissue
• Poorly fixed or improperly processed tissue blocks
• Tissue sections not on positively charged slides
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
A) Equipment:
• Fluorescence microscope with appropriate filter sets for DAPI,
Spectrum Green, and Spectrum Orange
• Water bath
• Slide warmer
• Hybridization oven
• Microtome
B) Reagents:
• HER2 DNA FISH Probe Kit (containing Spectrum Green-labeled
HER2 probe and Spectrum Orange-labeled CEP17 probe)
• Fluorescent mounting medium with DAPI
• Ethanol (70%, 90%, and 100%)
• Xylene
• 0.2 N HCl
• Pretreatment solution
• Protease solution
• Wash buffer
• Hybridization buffer
C) Supplies:
• Positively charged microscope slides
• Coverslips
• Humidified hybridization chamber
1. PROCEDURE
A) Slide Preparation:
1. Cut 4-5 μm tissue sections from FFPE tissue blocks and mount
them on positively charged slides.
2. Bake the slides at 56-60°C for 1-2 hours on a slide warmer.
B) Pretreatment:
1. Deparaffinize the slides in xylene for 3 x 5 minutes.
2. Rehydrate through graded ethanol series (100% for 2 x 3
minutes, 90% for 3 minutes, 70% for 3 minutes).
3. Rinse the slides in deionized water.
4. Immerse the slides in 0.2 N HCl for 20 minutes at room
temperature.
5. Rinse in deionized water for 3 x 5 minutes.
C) Enzymatic Digestion:
1. Immerse slides in the pretreatment solution at 95-98°C for 10
minutes.
2. Rinse slides in deionized water twice and then in wash buffer
for 5 minutes.
3. Immerse slides in protease solution at 37°C for 10-20 minutes.
4. Rinse slides in wash buffer for 5 minutes and then in deionized
water.
D) Probe Hybridization:
1. Apply 10 μL of HER2/CEP17 probe mix to the target area on
the slide.
2. Cover with a coverslip and seal with rubber cement.
3. Place slides in a humidified hybridization chamber.
4. Denature at 75°C for 5 minutes.
5. Hybridize at 37°C overnight (12-18 hours).
E) Post-Hybridization Wash:
1. Remove coverslips and immerse slides in wash buffer at 72°C
for 2-5 minutes.
2. Rinse briefly in deionized water and air dry in the dark.
F) Counterstaining and Mounting:
1. Apply 10 μL of DAPI-containing fluorescent mounting medium
to the slide.
2. Cover with a coverslip and allow to dry.
G) Visualization and Scoring:
1. Observe the slides under a fluorescence microscope with
appropriate filter sets.
2. Analyze at least 20-60 individual nuclei for each specimen.
3. Document the number of HER2 (green signals) and CEP17
(orange signals) in each nucleus.
4. Calculate the HER2/CEP17 signal ratio.
5. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
A) HER2/CEP17 Signal Ratio:
• HER2/CEP17 ratio < 1.8: Negative for HER2 amplification
• HER2/CEP17 ratio 1.8-2.2: Borderline (Equivocal) - requires
additional cells and/or alternative test
• HER2/CEP17 ratio > 2.2: Positive for HER2 amplification
1. QUALITY CONTROL
A) Positive Control:
• Include a known HER2-amplified tissue section for each run to
ensure assay performance.
B) Negative Control:
• Include a known non-amplified HER2 tissue section for each run.
C) Internal QC:
• Regularly check the fluorescence microscope for proper
alignment and calibration.
• Validate each new lot of HER2 DNA FISH Probe Kit before use.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
A) Documentation:
• Record all findings, including HER2/CEP17 signal counts, signal
ratio, and interpretation, in the laboratory information system
(LIS).
B) Reporting:
• Provide the final report with clear interpretation and any
recommendations for additional testing if required.

1. NOTES
• Ensure all steps are performed under appropriate lighting
conditions to protect fluorescent signals.
• Consider repeating the test if the results are inconclusive or if the
control samples do not perform as expected.
By following this SOP, laboratory personnel can ensure consistent
and accurate HER2 amplification analysis for effective patient
management.
