Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for HER2, BREAST, SEMI-
QUANTITATIVE IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY, MANUAL WITH
HER2 FISH REFLEX
1. PURPOSE
This protocol outlines the procedure for the semi-quantitative
immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis of HER2 in breast carcinoma
tissue samples. The procedure ensures the accurate and precise
determination of HER2 receptor status, which is crucial in the
management and treatment planning of breast cancer patients. This
protocol also includes reflex testing to Fluorescence In Situ
Hybridization (FISH) for equivocal IHC results.
Responsibility:
• Histopathology laboratory staff and technologists are responsible
for performing and documenting all steps related to the HER2 IHC
testing.
• Pathologists are responsible for the interpretation of the stained
slides and for ordering the subsequent FISH testing if needed.
• Supervisors ensure that all staff adhere to the protocol and
maintain quality standards.
1. SPECIMEN
A) Acceptable Specimens:
• Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) breast tissue samples
are required for HER2 IHC testing.
• Tissue samples must be adequately fixed at 10% neutral-buffered
formalin for 6-72 hours to ensure optimal staining and
interpretation.
B) Unacceptable Specimens:
• Inadequately fixed tissue specimens.
• Samples with processing artifacts that impair interpretation.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Automated or manual IHC staining system.
• HER2 primary antibody specific for IHC.
• Secondary detection system compatible with the primary HER2
antibody.
• DAB (3,3'-Diaminobenzidine) chromogen.
• Counterstaining reagents (e.g., Hematoxylin).
• Positive and negative control slides for HER2.
• Reflective materials for FISH: HER2 and CEP17 probes.
1. PROCEDURE
A) Immunohistochemistry (IHC)
1. Preparation:
◦ Cut 4-5 µm thick sections from properly fixed FFPE blocks
containing breast carcinoma tissue.
◦ Mount sections on positively charged microscope slides.
◦ Bake slides at 60°C for a minimum of one hour to facilitate
adhesion.
2. Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
◦ Deparaffinize sections in xylene or equivalent.
◦ Rehydrate through a graded series of alcohol to distilled
water.
3. Antigen Retrieval:
◦ Perform antigen retrieval using a heat-induced epitope
retrieval (HIER) method with a specific buffer recommended
for HER2 antibody. Follow manufacturer’s instructions for
time and temperature.
4. Staining:
◦ Block endogenous peroxidase activity by incubation with
appropriate blocking solution.
◦ Apply primary HER2 antibody and incubate as per
manufacturer's recommendation.
◦ Apply secondary antibody detection system and incubate.
◦ Visualize with DAB chromogen, counterstain with
hematoxylin.
5. Post-staining:
◦ Dehydrate slides through graded alcohols and clear in
xylene.
◦ Coverslip using a compatible mounting medium.
6. Quality Control:
◦ Include positive and negative control slides with each batch
of IHC staining.
◦ Ensure controls stain appropriately before reviewing patient
samples.
B) Interpretation of HER2 IHC
1. Scoring:
◦ Assess membrane staining intensity and percentage of
invasive tumor cells exhibiting HER2 staining.
◦ Score as follows:
▪ 0: No staining or membrane staining in <10% of tumor
cells.
▪ 1+: Faint/incomplete membrane staining in >10% of
tumor cells.
▪ 2+: Weak to moderate complete membrane staining in
>10% of tumor cells.
▪ 3+: Strong complete membrane staining in >10% of
tumor cells.
2. Reflex to FISH:
◦ If IHC score is 2+ (equivocal), reflex to HER2 FISH testing.
C) Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH)
1. FISH Preparation:
◦ Cut additional tissue sections for FISH analysis.
◦ Use validated HER2 and CEP17 probe kits for FISH
analysis.
2. Hybridization and Analysis:
◦ Perform FISH as per manufacturer’s protocol ensuring
appropriate hybridization and detection.
◦ Analyze signal patterns using a fluorescence microscope.
◦ Determine HER2 gene amplification status by evaluating
HER2/CEP17 signal ratio.
3. REPORTING RESULTS
• Record the IHC HER2 score in the patient’s laboratory information
system (LIS).
• For cases reflexed to FISH, report the FISH results including
HER2/CEP17 ratio and any amplification status details.
• Include interpretive comments according to current ASCO/CAP
guidelines.
1. QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE
• Regularly review quality control data for IHC and FISH
procedures.
• Participate in external quality assurance programs to ensure
ongoing accuracy and validity of HER2 testing.
1. REFERENCES
Include relevant references such as the ASCO/CAP guidelines for
HER2 testing, manufacturer’s instructions for both IHC and FISH
assays, and pertinent literature on HER2 status evaluation in breast
cancer.

reliable, and timely analysis of HER2 status in breast carcinoma,
aiding in effective patient management and treatment planning.
