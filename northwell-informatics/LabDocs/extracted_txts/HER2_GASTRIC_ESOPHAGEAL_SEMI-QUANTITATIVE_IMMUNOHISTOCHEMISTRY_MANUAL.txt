Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for HER2
Immunohistochemistry Analysis in Gastric/Esophageal Cancer
1. PURPOSE 1.1. The purpose of this procedure is to provide
guidelines for the semi-quantitative analysis of HER2
expression in gastric and esophageal cancer specimens using
manual immunohistochemistry (IHC). 1.2. This process ensures
the quality and accuracy of test results to aid in the diagnosis
and treatment planning for patients.
2. RESPONSIBILITY 2.1. It is the responsibility of designated
laboratory personnel to perform, monitor, and document all
steps involved in the IHC analysis. 2.2. Laboratory
technologists are responsible for identifying any deviations or
issues encountered during analysis and reporting them to the
supervisor. 2.3. Supervisors are responsible for ensuring
adherence to this SOP and implementing corrective actions if
necessary.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS 3.1. Acceptable Specimens:
3.1.1. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue
sections from gastric or esophageal biopsies or surgical
resections. 3.1.2. Slides must be cut at 3-4 microns and placed
on positively charged glass slides. 3.2. Storage and Handling:
3.2.1. Store FFPE blocks and unstained slides at room
temperature. 3.2.2. Avoid prolonged exposure to light and
moisture to prevent antigen degradation.
4. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES 4.1. Primary antibody for HER2
(e.g., anti-HER2/neu, clone 4B5). 4.2. Secondary antibody and
detection system (e.g., polymer-based HRP). 4.3. Positive
control tissue section known to express HER2. 4.4. Negative
control (non-immune serum or reagent diluent). 4.5.
Hematoxylin counterstain. 4.6. Mounting medium. 4.7.
Deionized water, PBS (Phosphate-Buffered Saline). 4.8. Xylene
and ethanol for deparaffinization and rehydration.
5. EQUIPMENT 5.1. Microscopes. 5.2. Manual staining rack. 5.3.
Microtome. 5.4. Water bath and slide warmer. 5.5. Timer.
6. PROCEDURE 6.1. Slide Preparation: 6.1.1. Deparaffinize
slides in xylene (2 changes, 5 minutes each). 6.1.2. Rehydrate
tissue sections through graded alcohols (100%, 95%, 70%) to
distilled water. 6.2. Antigen Retrieval: 6.2.1. Heat-induced
epitope retrieval (HIER) using a retrieval buffer (e.g., citrate
buffer pH 6.0) in a microwave, pressure cooker, or water bath.
6.2.2. Cool slides to room temperature and rinse in PBS. 6.3.
Immunostaining: 6.3.1. Block endogenous peroxidase activity
with 3% hydrogen peroxide in PBS for 10 minutes. 6.3.2. Wash
slides in PBS (3 x 5 minutes each). 6.3.3. Apply primary HER2
antibody and incubate according to manufacturer’s
recommendations (typically 30-60 minutes). 6.3.4. Wash slides
in PBS (3 x 5 minutes each). 6.3.5. Apply secondary antibody
and detection reagent, incubate as per kit instructions (typically
30 minutes). 6.3.6. Wash in PBS (3 x 5 minutes each). 6.3.7.
Develop color with DAB (diaminobenzidine) substrate for 5-10
minutes or until optimal color development. 6.3.8. Rinse in
distilled water. 6.4. Counterstaining and Mounting: 6.4.1.
Counterstain with hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes. 6.4.2. Rinse in
tap water, followed by bluing in alkaline solution (e.g., 0.1%
sodium bicarbonate). 6.4.3. Dehydrate through graded ethanols
(70%, 95%, 100%) and clear in xylene. 6.4.4. Mount coverslips
with mounting medium.
7. SCORING AND REPORTING 7.1. Score HER2 staining based
on intensity and percentage of positive cells: 7.1.1. 0 - No
staining or membranous staining in <10% of tumor cells. 7.1.2.
1+ - Weak membranous staining in >10% of tumor cells. 7.1.3.
2+ - Moderate membranous staining in >10% of tumor cells.
7.1.4. 3+ - Strong membranous staining in >10% of tumor cells.
7.2. Document findings in laboratory information system or
report form. 7.3. Retain slide images and quality control
documentation.
8. QUALITY CONTROL 8.1. Run positive and negative controls
with each staining batch. 8.2. Evaluate controls to ensure
reproducibility and consistency. 8.3. Maintain records of lot
numbers, expiration dates, and performance of reagents.
9. REFERENCES 9.1. Manufacturer’s instructions for primary and
secondary antibodies. 9.2. College of American Pathologists
(CAP) guidelines for HER2 testing in gastric cancer.
This SOP provides a standardized protocol to ensure accurate HER2
IHC analysis, vital for the management of gastric and esophageal
cancer treatments.
