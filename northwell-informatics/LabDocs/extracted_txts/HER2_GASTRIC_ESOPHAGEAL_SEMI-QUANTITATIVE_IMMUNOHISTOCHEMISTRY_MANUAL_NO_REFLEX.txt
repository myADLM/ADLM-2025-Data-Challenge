Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for HER2, Gastric/
Esophageal, Semi-Quantitative Immunohistochemistry Analysis
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to provide a standardized method for
performing the semi-quantitative immunohistochemistry (IHC)
analysis of HER2 in gastric and esophageal cancer specimens. This
ensures consistent, accurate, and reliable results that inform clinical
decision-making.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
• Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing
the HER2 IHC analysis following this SOP.
• It is the duty of all laboratory personnel to identify any deviations
or issues during the procedure and report them to a supervisor
immediately.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue sections from
gastric or esophageal cancer samples.
• Tissue sections should be 3-5 micrometers thick.
• Specimen requisition should include patient details, biopsied site,
and a relevant clinical history.
1. REAGENTS AND MATERIALS
• HER2 primary antibody specific for gastric/esophageal cancer.
• Detection kit (HRP-conjugated secondary antibody, DAB
substrate).
• Positive control tissue (known HER2-positive gastric/esophageal
cancer tissue).
• Negative control tissue (known HER2-negative tissue).
• Other required materials: slides, gloves, cover slips, mounting
medium, buffer solutions (e.g., Tris-buffered saline), and distilled
water.
1. EQUIPMENT
• Microtome
• Water bath
• Slide incubator
• Automated or manual staining platform
• Microscope (40x and 100x objectives)
1. PROTOCOL
6.1 Deparaffinization and Rehydration
• Place slides in a 60°C oven for 30 minutes.
• Deparaffinize slides by incubating in xylene for 10 minutes (two
changes).
• Rehydrate through graded alcohol series: 100%, 95%, 70%, and
distilled water.
6.2 Antigen Retrieval
• Preheat antigen retrieval buffer (e.g., citrate buffer, pH 6.0 or
EDTA, pH 9.0) in a water bath or microwave.
• Immerse slides in the prepared buffer and perform heat-induced
epitope retrieval (HIER) for 20-40 minutes.
• Allow slides to cool down at room temperature for 20 minutes.
• Rinse slides in distilled water, followed by Tris-buffered saline
(TBS) wash.
6.3 Immunohistochemistry Staining
• Block endogenous peroxidase activity by incubating slides with
3% hydrogen peroxide solution for 10 minutes.
• Rinse slides in TBS.
• Apply the HER2 primary antibody (diluted to the recommended
concentration) and incubate in a humidified chamber for 30-60
minutes.
• Rinse slides in TBS.
• Apply secondary HRP-conjugated antibody and incubate as per
manufacturer’s instructions.
• Rinse slides in TBS.
• Develop with DAB chromogen substrate until desired intensity is
achieved (usually 2-10 minutes).
• Rinse slides in distilled water.
6.4 Counterstaining and Mounting
• Counterstain with hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes.
• Rinse slides in running tap water.
• Dehydrate through graded alcohol series and clear in xylene.
• Apply cover slips with mounting medium.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run positive and negative control slides with each batch of patient
specimens.
• Ensure that all steps are performed consistently and as per
manufacturer instructions.
• Document any deviations or anomalies encountered during the
procedure.
1. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
• Assess HER2 staining intensity and percentage of positive cells
under microscopy.
• Score according to the established semi-quantitative HER2
scoring criteria for gastric/esophageal cancer:
◦ 0 = No reactivity or membranous reactivity in <10% of cells.
◦ 1+ = Weak membranous reactivity in ≥10% of cells.
◦ 2+ = Moderate-to-strong complete or basolateral membranous
reactivity in ≥10% of cells.
◦ 3+ = Strong complete or basolateral membranous reactivity in
≥10% of cells.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Document the HER2 score in the patient’s laboratory report.
• Results should be reviewed and verified by a qualified pathologist.
• Include any relevant comments regarding sample quality, staining
intensity, or technical issues observed.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions for the HER2 primary antibody and
detection kit.
• Relevant clinical guidelines for HER2 testing in gastric/
esophageal cancers.
1. REVISION HISTORY
• Document any changes or updates to this SOP.
