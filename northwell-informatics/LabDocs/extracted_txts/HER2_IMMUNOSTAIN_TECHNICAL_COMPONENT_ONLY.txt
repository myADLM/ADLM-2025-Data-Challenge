1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is to
outline the analytical phase procedures for performing the Human
Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2) immunostaining in the
pathology laboratory. This includes all steps necessary to ensure
accurate, reliable, and reproducible results for the technical
component of HER2 immunostain testing.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of trained laboratory personnel to strictly follow
this procedure to ensure the accuracy and reliability of test results.
The technical supervisor is responsible for overseeing the adherence
to the protocol and addressing any deviations.
1. SCOPE
This protocol applies to all HER2 immunostaining procedures
conducted in the laboratory for diagnostic purposes.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
3.1. Acceptable Specimen Types:
• Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks.
• Unstained slides cut at 4-5 microns from FFPE tissue blocks.
3.2. Unacceptable Specimen:
• Tissue that is improperly fixed.
• Tissue blocks with insufficient material.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
4.1. Equipment:
• Microtome
• Water bath
• Slide warmers
• Automated immunostaining instrument (if applicable)
• Microscope
• Forceps
• Humidity chamber (if manual staining is performed)
4.2. Reagents:
• HER2 primary antibody
• Secondary antibody horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated
• Detection system (e.g., DAB chromogen)
• Hematoxylin (counterstain)
• Xylene, ethanol series (for deparaffinization and rehydration)
• Mounting medium
• Positive and negative control slides
1. PROCEDURE
5.1. Slide Preparation:
1. Cut 4-5 micron thick tissue sections from FFPE blocks.
2. Float sections on a water bath maintained at 40-45°C.
3. Place sections onto positively charged slides.
4. Dry slides on a slide warmer or in an oven at 60°C for 30-60
minutes.
5.2. Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
1. Deparaffinize sections in xylene for 3 x 5 minutes.
2. Rehydrate sections through a series of graded ethanol (100%,
95%, 80%) 2 x 3 minutes each.
3. Rinse in distilled water for 2 x 2 minutes.
5.3. Antigen Retrieval:
1. Perform antigen retrieval using a heat-induced epitope retrieval
(HIER) method.
2. Place slides in a retrieval buffer (e.g., citrate buffer, pH 6.0 or
TRIS-EDTA Buffer, pH 9.0).
3. Heat the slides using a microwave, pressure cooker, or steamer
according to the determined optimal conditions for the antigen
(typically 95-100°C for 20-40 minutes).
4. Allow slides to cool to room temperature in the retrieval buffer.
5. Rinse slides in distilled water followed by PBS for 2 x 2
minutes.
5.4. Immunostaining:
1. Encircle tissue sections with a hydrophobic barrier pen.
2. Incubate slides with hydrogen peroxide blocking solution if
using HRP detection to quench endogenous peroxidase activity
for 10 minutes.
3. Rinse in PBS/TBS buffer for 2 x 5 minutes.
4. Apply the HER2 primary antibody and incubate at room
temperature or as per manufacturer's instructions.
5. Rinse in PBS/TBS buffer for 2 x 5 minutes.
6. Apply the secondary antibody (HRP-conjugated) and incubate
as per manufacturer's instructions.
7. Rinse in PBS/TBS buffer for 2 x 5 minutes.
8. Apply the DAB chromogen solution and incubate until the
desired stain intensity is achieved (usually 5-10 minutes).
9. Rinse in distilled water for 2 x 5 minutes.
5.5. Counterstaining and Mounting:
1. Counterstain sections with hematoxylin for 2-3 minutes.
2. Rinse in distilled water followed by a dip in 0.5% acid alcohol if
differentiation is required.
3. Blue sections in running tap water for 5 minutes.
4. Dehydrate sections through graded ethanol solutions (80%,
95%, 100%) followed by xylene.
5. Mount coverslips using a permanent mounting medium.
5.6. Quality Control:
1. Include positive and negative control slides with each staining
run.
2. Review the quality of staining on control slides before analyzing
patient slides.
3. INTERPRETATION AND DOCUMENTATION
◦ Results are evaluated by a qualified pathologist.
◦ Record and document all observations, including any
deviations from expected results, in the laboratory
information system.
