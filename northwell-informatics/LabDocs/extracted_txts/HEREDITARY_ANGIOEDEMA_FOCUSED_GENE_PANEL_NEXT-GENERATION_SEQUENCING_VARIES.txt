HEREDITARY ANGIOEDEMA FOCUSED GENE PANEL, NEXT-
GENERATION SEQUENCING (NGS) PROTOCOL
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this protocol is to standardize the procedure for the
analysis and interpretation of the Hereditary Angioedema (HAE)
Focused Gene Panel using Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS). This
will ensure accurate and consistent results for the detection of
genetic variants associated with Hereditary Angioedema.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the certified medical laboratory scientist or
technician to follow this protocol rigorously to ensure the quality and
accuracy of the results. The laboratory supervisor is responsible for
overseeing and verifying the compliance with this SOP.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
◦ Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) platform (e.g., Illumina,
Ion Torrent)
◦ Library preparation kit (e.g., Illumina TruSeq, Ion AmpliSeq)
◦ Targeted capture probes specific to Hereditary Angioedema
genes
◦ qPCR or other quantitation methods for library quantification
◦ Bioinformatics software for data analysis (e.g., BWA, GATK,
ANNOVAR)
◦ DNA extraction kit
◦ Quality control reagents and materials
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
◦ Peripheral blood, saliva, or buccal swab
◦ DNA concentration: 2 µg with a minimum concentration of
30 ng/µL
◦ DNA purity: A260/280 ratio between 1.8 and 2.0
3. PROCEDURE
5.1. DNA Extraction and Quality Control
• Extract DNA from the specimen using a validated DNA extraction
kit.
• Measure DNA concentration and purity using a
spectrophotometer (e.g., NanoDrop) and fluorometer (e.g., Qubit).
• Ensure DNA integrity by running an aliquot on an agarose gel or
using a Bioanalyzer.
5.2. Library Preparation
• Follow the manufacturer's instructions to prepare the DNA library
using the selected library preparation kit.
• Perform targeted capture using the specific probes for Hereditary
Angioedema genes.
• Amplify the library as per the protocol and perform quality control
checks on the final library to assess quantity and fragment size
distribution.
5.3. Sequencing Run
• Load the prepared library onto the NGS platform according to the
manufacturer’s guidelines.
• Execute the sequencing run ensuring all settings and parameters
meet the required specifications (e.g., read length, coverage
depth).
5.4. Data Analysis
• Preprocess sequencing reads: Trim adapter sequences and low-
quality bases.
• Align the reads to the human reference genome (e.g., hg38) using
BWA or another suitable aligner.
• Perform variant calling using GATK or an equivalent pipeline.
• Annotate variants using ANNOVAR or other annotation tools to
determine the potential impact on gene function.
5.5. Interpretation and Reporting
• Review the list of identified variants to determine their clinical
significance with respect to Hereditary Angioedema.
• Cross-reference identified variants with databases such as
ClinVar, HGMD, and relevant literature.
• Prepare a comprehensive report including patient details, list of
identified variants, interpretation of each variant's significance,
and any recommended follow-up actions.
5.6. Quality Control and Assurance
• Include positive and negative controls in each batch of DNA
extractions, library preparations, and sequencing runs.
• Troubleshoot and document any deviations or failures
encountered during the procedure.
• Ensure compliance with CLIA regulations, and institute regular
proficiency testing and audits.
1. RESULT DOCUMENTATION
◦ Document all findings in the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
◦ Reports generated from NGS data must be reviewed and
signed off by a certified geneticist or molecular pathologist.
2. REFERENCES
◦ Manufacturer’s protocol for DNA extraction kit, library
preparation kit, and NGS platform.
◦ GATK Best Practices for variant discovery in DNAseq.
◦ ANNOVAR: functional annotation of genetic variants from
high-throughput sequencing data.
By adhering to this SOP, the laboratory ensures accurate, reliable,
and clinically relevant results for Hereditary Angioedema through the
targeted gene panel using Next-Generation Sequencing.
