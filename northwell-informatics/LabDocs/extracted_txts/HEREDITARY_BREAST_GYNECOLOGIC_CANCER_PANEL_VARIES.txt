Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Hereditary Breast/Gynecologic Cancer
Panel
1. PURPOSE
To outline the step-by-step procedure for the analysis and reporting
of results for the Hereditary Breast/Gynecologic Cancer Panel to
ensure accurate, reliable, and timely results for patients.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all personnel involved in the analytical
phase of Hereditary Breast/Gynecologic Cancer Panel testing
conducted in the CLIA-certified laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Laboratory Technologists: Perform the analysis according to this
protocol.
• Supervisors: Oversee the process, ensure quality control, and
address any issues or discrepancies.
• Data Analysts: Interpret and verify the results.
• Laboratory Director: Final review and authorization of the
released results.
4. SPECIMEN HANDLING
4.1. Acceptable Specimens:
• Whole blood collected in EDTA tubes.
• Buccal swabs stored in appropriate collection containers.
• Extracted DNA from validated sources.
4.2. Specimen Storage:
• Store whole blood samples at 2-8°C and process within 72 hours
of collection.
• Store extracted DNA at -20°C or below until ready for analysis.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
5.1. Equipment:
• DNA Extraction Kits and Automation Systems (if applicable)
• PCR Thermal Cyclers
• Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) Platforms
• Real-Time PCR Systems (for confirmation and QC)
• Centrifuges, Pipettes, and related lab equipment
5.2. Reagents:
• PCR Master Mixes
• Primers and Probes for target regions
• Sequencing Kits and Reagents specific to the NGS platform
• Positive and Negative Control DNA
5.3. Supplies:
• Microcentrifuge tubes
• PCR plates and sealing films
• Pipette tips (filtered and non-filtered as required)
• Gloves, lab coats, and other PPE
6. PROCEDURE
6.1. DNA Extraction: 1. Extract DNA from the specimen using
validated extraction kits following the manufacturer's instructions. 2.
Quantify and assess the quality of extracted DNA using a Qubit
Fluorometer or a similar device. 3. Record DNA concentration and
purity ratios (A260/280 and A260/230).
6.2. Library Preparation: 1. Prepare the DNA library according to
the NGS platform's protocol. 2. Index and pool samples as per the
guidelines provided in the kit's user manual. 3. Perform quality control
of the prepared library using Bioanalyzer or TapeStation to ensure
proper fragment size and concentration.
6.3. Sequencing: 1. Load the prepared library onto the NGS
platform. 2. Set up the sequencing run with the appropriate
parameters for the Hereditary Breast/Gynecologic Cancer Panel. 3.
Monitor the sequencing run and address any issues that may arise
during the process.
6.4. Data Analysis and Interpretation: 1. Use bioinformatics tools
and software to process raw sequencing data. 2. Align the sequences
to the reference genome and identify variants. 3. Validate and classify
variants using databases such as ClinVar and in-house variant
classification guidelines. 4. Review and interpret the results by
comparing with patient history and clinical presentation.
7. QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE
7.1. Internal Quality Control: 1. Run positive and negative controls
alongside patient samples to ensure the assay's accuracy. 2. Ensure
all QC metrics meet the pre-determined criteria before releasing
results.
7.2. External Quality Control: 1. Participate in proficiency testing
programs and inter-laboratory comparisons. 2. Maintain
documentation of QC results and corrective actions taken for any
discrepancies.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Compile results and verify accuracy against internal controls.
2. Generate a report that includes identified variants, their clinical
significance, and relevant patient-specific recommendations.
3. Have the laboratory director or designated supervisor review
and sign off on the results.
4. Release the final report to the ordering physician or clinician.
9. LIMITATIONS AND CONSIDERATIONS
1. Certain regions may not be adequately covered with NGS;
confirmatory tests may be necessary.
2. Variants of unknown significance (VUS) should be interpreted
with caution and discussed with genetic counseling.
3. False positives/negatives can occur; results should correlate
with clinical findings and other diagnostic tests.

11. REVIEW AND UPDATES
This SOP will be reviewed annually or whenever there are significant
changes in the methodology, equipment, or reagents. Updates and
changes must be documented, and the revised SOP must be
approved by the laboratory director.
12. DOCUMENT CONTROL
This is version 1.0 of the SOP for the Hereditary Breast/Gynecologic
Cancer Panel. It is the responsibility of the laboratory staff to ensure
they are using the most current version of this document.
By following this SOP, the laboratory aims to ensure the precision
and accuracy of the Hereditary Breast/Gynecologic Cancer Panel
testing and provide reliable information to support patient care and
management.
