Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for HEREDITARY COMMON CANCER PANEL
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the detailed protocol for the
analytical phase of generating results for the HEREDITARY
COMMON CANCER PANEL. This protocol ensures accurate,
reliable, and reproducible results for assessing genetic variants
associated with hereditary cancers.
Responsibility:
Designated staff including genetic technologists and laboratory
personnel are responsible for performing the steps outlined in this
SOP. It is the responsibility of the lab supervisor to ensure
compliance with these procedures.
1. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory procedures involving extraction,
amplification, sequencing, data analysis, and reporting for the
HEREDITARY COMMON CANCER PANEL.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Preparation
1. Receive specimens and verify patient information.
2. Follow standard operating procedures for specimen handling
and accessioning.
3. Extract DNA from blood or saliva specimens using an
appropriate extraction kit, ensuring high yield and purity.
B. DNA Quality Assessment
1. Quantify extracted DNA using spectrophotometry and check
purity ratios (A260/A280).
2. Assess DNA integrity using agarose gel electrophoresis, if
necessary.
C. PCR Amplification
1. Set up multiplex PCR reactions targeting genes associated with
hereditary cancers (e.g., BRCA1, BRCA2, MLH1, MSH2, etc.).
2. Prepare PCR Mastermix including dNTPs, primers, buffer, and
Taq polymerase.
3. Amplify targeted regions using thermal cycler with appropriate
cycling parameters.
◦ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 5 minutes.
◦ Denaturation: 95°C for 30 seconds.
◦ Annealing: Optimal temperature (e.g., 55-65°C) for 30
seconds.
◦ Extension: 72°C for 1 minute.
◦ Final extension: 72°C for 10 minutes.
D. PCR Cleanup
1. Use columns or enzymatic methods to purify PCR products.
2. Quantify purified PCR products using fluorometry.
E. Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS)
1. Prepare sequencing libraries using the appropriate kit for
targeted sequencing.
2. Perform library quality control (QC) using Bioanalyzer or
equivalent technology.
3. Pool libraries and load onto an NGS platform (e.g., Illumina) as
per manufacturer’s instructions.
4. Sequence using specified run parameters to obtain sufficient
coverage.
F. Data Analysis
1. Perform initial data QC using FASTQ files.
2. Align sequences to the reference genome using bioinformatics
software (e.g., BWA, GATK).
3. Call variants using an appropriate variant calling algorithm.
4. Annotate variants using databases such as ClinVar, dbSNP,
COSMIC.
G. Interpretation of Results
1. Evaluate identified variants for pathogenicity, likely
pathogenicity, or variants of uncertain significance.
2. Review findings in the context of patient's clinical information
and family history.
3. Document interpretations and recommendations.
H. Reporting Results
1. Compile results into a comprehensive report including:
◦ Summary of findings
◦ Genetic variants identified
◦ Clinical significance and recommendations
2. Review report internally for accuracy and compliance.
3. Send final report to ordering physician or genetic counselor.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
5. Run positive and negative controls alongside patient samples.
6. Conduct periodic validation of procedures with external
proficiency tests.
7. Maintain detailed records of all analytical runs and results.
8. Ensure all equipment is regularly calibrated and maintained.
9. REFERENCES
10. Manufacturer's instructions for DNA extraction, PCR, library
preparation, and sequencing kits.
11. Bioinformatics software manuals (e.g., BWA, GATK).
12. Databases for variant annotation (e.g., ClinVar, dbSNP,
COSMIC).
13. Publications and guidelines on hereditary cancer genetics.
14. DOCUMENTATION
15. Record all specimen information and lab results in the
Laboratory Information System (LIS).
16. Maintain logs of quality control measures, instrument
calibrations, and proficiency testing.
By adhering to this SOP, the laboratory can ensure the accuracy and
reliability of results for the HEREDITARY COMMON CANCER
PANEL, facilitating appropriate clinical management for patients.
