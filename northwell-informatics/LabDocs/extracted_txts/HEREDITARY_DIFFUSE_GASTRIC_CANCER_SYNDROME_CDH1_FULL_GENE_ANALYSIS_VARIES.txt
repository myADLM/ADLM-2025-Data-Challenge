Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Title: Analytical Protocol for
HEREDITARY DIFFUSE GASTRIC CANCER SYNDROME (HDGC),
CDH1, FULL GENE ANALYSIS
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this standard operating procedure (SOP) is to
establish the laboratory protocol for performing full gene analysis of
the CDH1 gene to identify mutations associated with Hereditary
Diffuse Gastric Cancer Syndrome (HDGC). This SOP details the
analytical process from DNA extraction to result interpretation and
reporting.
Responsibility:
Laboratory personnel are responsible for following this SOP and
ensuring all steps are accurately performed and documented.
Supervisors are responsible for reviewing, validating, and authorizing
final results.
1. SPECIMEN
Specimen Requirements: -Peripheral blood: EDTA tube (lavender
top); minimum 3 ml, preferably 6-10 ml. -Saliva: Collected with a
recommended DNA saliva collection kit; approximately 2 ml. -Tissue:
Fresh, frozen, or paraffin-embedded tissue with a minimum of 10 mg
of material. -Unacceptable Specimens: Specimens that are clotted,
hemolyzed, non-EDTA blood, improperly labeled, or have been
inadequately stored.
Specimen Handling: -Blood and saliva specimens should be
transported to the laboratory at room temperature and processed
within 48 hours of collection. -Tissue specimens should be
transported on dry ice for fresh or frozen samples, or at room
temperature for paraffin-embedded samples.

1. PROCEDURE
A) DNA Extraction:
1. Extract DNA from the collected specimen using the validated
DNA extraction kit per manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Quantify the DNA using a Nanodrop spectrophotometer and
ensure the DNA concentration is within the acceptable range
(10-100 ng/µl).
3. Document the DNA concentration and purity (A260/A280 ratio)
in the appropriate log.
B) PCR Amplification:
1. Design primers to cover the entire coding region and exon-
intron boundaries of the CDH1 gene.
2. Set up the PCR reaction mixture with DNA template, primers,
Taq polymerase, dNTPs, and buffer in a PCR tube or plate.
3. Program the thermocycler with the following conditions:
◦ Initial denaturation at 95°C for 5 minutes
◦ 35 cycles of:
▪ Denaturation at 95°C for 30 seconds
▪ Annealing at 55-60°C (temperature depends on primer)
for 30 seconds
▪ Extension at 72°C for 1 minute per kb
◦ Final extension at 72°C for 10 minutes
◦ Hold at 4°C
C) Quality Control:
1. Run a portion of the PCR product on an agarose gel to confirm
successful amplification.
2. Document the presence of the expected PCR product size in
the laboratory log.
D) Purification and Sequencing:
1. Purify the PCR product using a PCR purification kit following
the manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Quantify the purified PCR product to ensure a concentration
suitable for sequencing.
3. Set up the sequencing reaction using the purified PCR product,
sequencing primers, and sequencing reagents.
4. Load the sequencing reaction onto the sequencing platform and
perform sequencing according to the manufacturer's protocols.
E) Data Analysis and Interpretation:
1. Analyze the sequencing data using bioinformatics tools to
identify mutations in the CDH1 gene.
2. Compare identified variants with reference databases (e.g.,
ClinVar, HGMD) to determine their pathogenicity.
3. Interpret the clinical significance of identified mutations in the
context of HDGC.
4. REPORTING RESULTS
5. Compile the sequencing results and interpretation in a report.
6. Include information on identified mutations, their predicted
effect on protein function, and clinical relevance.
7. Review and validate the report by a qualified supervisor.
8. Deliver the final report to the requesting physician or genetic
counselor.
9. QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE
10. Internal control DNA samples must be run with each batch to
ensure the accuracy of the sequencing process.
11. Include no template control (NTC) in each PCR run to check for
contamination.
12. Participate in external quality assessment (EQA) schemes to
ensure proficiency.
