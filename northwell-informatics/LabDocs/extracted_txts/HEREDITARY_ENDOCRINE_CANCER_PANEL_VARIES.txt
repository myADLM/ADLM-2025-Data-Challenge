Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Hereditary Endocrine
Cancer Panel Analysis
1. Purpose: To outline the procedure for the analysis and
generation of results for the Hereditary Endocrine Cancer Panel
using next-generation sequencing (NGS).
2. Scope: This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel
performing the Hereditary Endocrine Cancer Panel analysis in
the laboratory.
3. Responsibility:
◦ It is the responsibility of designated laboratory personnel to
perform the analysis as outlined in this SOP.
◦ The laboratory supervisors are responsible for ensuring staff
compliance with this SOP and for addressing any deviations
or issues that arise during the analytical process.
4. Prerequisites:
◦ Specimen collection, receipt, and accessioning must be
completed and approved.
◦ Ensure that all instruments and reagents are within their
valid calibration and expiry dates.
5. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies:
◦ NGS Instrument (e.g., Illumina MiSeq, NextSeq, or
equivalent)
◦ Hereditary Endocrine Cancer Panel Kit (e.g., Agilent
SureSelect, Illumina TruSight, or equivalent)
◦ High-sensitivity DNA quantification reagents and equipment
(e.g., Qubit, Bioanalyzer)
◦ PCR reagents and consumables
◦ Pipettes and sterile pipette tips
◦ Nuclease-free water
◦ Laboratory consumables (tubes, plates, etc.)
6. Procedure:
A) DNA Extraction and Quantitation:
1. Ensure that the DNA extraction from the collected
specimen has been completed.
2. Quantify the extracted DNA using Qubit or an equivalent
quantification method.
3. Assess the quality of DNA by running a sample on a
Bioanalyzer or equivalent.
B) Library Preparation:
1. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for the Hereditary
Endocrine Cancer Panel Kit to prepare libraries.
2. Amplify the target regions using PCR.
3. Purify the PCR product using appropriate purification
methods (e.g., magnetic beads).
4. Quantify and assess the quality of the amplified libraries
using Bioanalyzer or equivalent.
C) Library Pooling and Sequencing:
1. Pool the prepared libraries according to the protocol
provided by the NGS instrument manufacturer.
2. Load the pooled libraries onto the NGS instrument.
3. Set up the sequencing run parameters as per the NGS
instrument and kit protocol.
4. Initiate the sequencing run.
D) Data Analysis:
1. Upon completion of the sequencing run, transfer the data
to the bioinformatics pipeline.
2. Perform quality control checks on the sequencing data
(e.g., read quality, coverage metrics).
3. Align the sequencing reads to the reference genome
(e.g., human genome build GRCh38).
4. Call variants (e.g., SNPs, indels) using a validated variant
calling pipeline.
5. Annotate the identified variants using appropriate
annotation tools.
6. Filter the annotated variants based on the clinical
relevance and quality metrics.
E) Result Interpretation and Reporting:
1. Interpret the filtered variants in the context of hereditary
endocrine cancer.
2. Review the variants by an experienced molecular
geneticist.
3. Generate a clinical report summarizing significant
findings, including variant interpretation, clinical
significance, and recommendations.
4. Submit the report for final review and approval by the
relevant clinical personnel.
5. Ensure the report is uploaded into the Laboratory
Information System (LIS) for review and verification.
7. Quality Control:
◦ Include positive and negative controls in each batch of
analysis.
◦ Analyze internal quality control materials as specified,
documenting their results.
◦ Perform inter-lab quality assessments periodically to ensure
consistency and accuracy.
◦ Regularly assess all equipment and reagents for compliance
with quality standards.
8. Reporting Results:
◦ Review and verify results within the LIS.
◦ Communicate critical or unexpected results to the
requesting physician promptly.
◦ Confirm that all reporting adheres to the laboratory's
reporting guidelines and turnaround times.
9. Sample Integrity:
◦ If a sample’s integrity is in question (e.g., insufficient DNA,
degraded sample), document the issue, and follow up with
appropriate corrective measures such as re-extraction or re-
collection.
