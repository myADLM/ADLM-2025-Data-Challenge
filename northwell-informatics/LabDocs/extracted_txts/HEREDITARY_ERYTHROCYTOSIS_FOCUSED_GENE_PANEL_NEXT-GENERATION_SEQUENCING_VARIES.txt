Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
HEREDITARY ERYTHROCYTOSIS FOCUSED GENE PANEL,
NEXT-GENERATION SEQUENCING, VARIES
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the steps and responsibilities for the detection of
variants associated with hereditary erythrocytosis using next-
generation sequencing (NGS). The procedure details the analytical
phase starting from the reception of the extracted DNA to the
generation and interpretation of sequencing results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
Laboratory personnel are responsible for ensuring that the NGS
workflow is performed accurately and efficiently. This includes quality
control, library preparation, sequencing, data analysis, and reporting
of results. Supervisors are responsible for reviewing data, validating
results, and addressing any discrepancies that arise during the
analytical process.
3. DEFINITIONS
• NGS: Next-Generation Sequencing, a high-throughput method to
determine nucleotide sequences in DNA.
• Library Preparation: The process of preparing DNA samples for
sequencing.
• Hereditary Erythrocytosis (HE): A genetic condition
characterized by an increased number of red blood cells.
• Focused Gene Panel: A set of genes known to be associated
with HE that will be specifically sequenced.
4. PROCEDURE
The analytical phase includes NGS workflow, starting from DNA
quality assessment to the final generation and analysis of sequencing
data.
A) DNA Quality Check
1. Quantify DNA:
◦ Use a fluorometric method (Qubit or similar) to determine
the concentration of extracted DNA.
◦ Record values. Acceptable DNA concentration: 10-100 ng/
µL.
2. Assess DNA Integrity:
◦ Evaluate DNA integrity using agarose gel electrophoresis or
an automated system (e.g., TapeStation).
◦ DNA should present as a high molecular weight band.
B) Library Preparation
1. Fragmentation:
◦ Perform DNA fragmentation using enzymatic or mechanical
methods to generate an average fragment size of 200-300
bp.
2. End Repair and A-Tailing:
◦ Repair DNA fragments to blunt ends followed by A-tailing to
add adenine (A) overhangs.
3. Adapter Ligation:
◦ Ligate sequencing adapters, which contain indices for
sample identification.
4. PCR Amplification:
◦ Perform PCR amplification to enrich adapter-ligated
fragments.
◦ Evaluate the success of library preparation using
quantitative PCR (qPCR) or electrophoresis.
C) Target Enrichment
1. Hybridization with Capture Probes:
◦ Use capture probes specific for genes associated with HE to
enrich the target regions.
2. Post-Hybridization Amplification:
◦ Perform additional PCR amplification to further enrich target
regions.
D) Sequencing
1. Loading Libraries:
◦ Quantify the prepared libraries and pool equimolar amounts.
◦ Load the pooled libraries onto the NGS platform (e.g.,
Illumina).
2. Sequencing Run:
◦ Initiate a sequencing run, monitoring the process to ensure
optimal cluster generation and data quality.
E) Data Analysis
1. Initial Data Processing:
◦ Generate FASTQ files and perform initial quality control
checks using software such as FastQC.
2. Alignment:
◦ Align sequences to the reference genome using alignment
tools such as BWA or Bowtie2.
3. Variant Calling:
◦ Call variants using software like GATK or samtools.
◦ Annotate variants using databases such as ClinVar or
dbSNP.
4. Filtering and Prioritization:
◦ Filter variants based on quality scores and allele frequency.
◦ Prioritize clinically relevant variants associated with HE.
F) Reporting Results
1. Generate Report:
◦ Create a comprehensive report summarizing identified
variants, their potential clinical significance, and supporting
evidence.
2. Review and Validation:
◦ Have a senior technologist or supervisor review and validate
the report.
◦ Discuss any uncertain findings or rare variants with a
geneticist or other specialist.
G) Documenting Results:
• Record all findings in the laboratory information system (LIS) with
the date, time, and initials of the technologist.
• Archive sequencing data and associated analysis files on secure
storage systems.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform QC checks at each step of the procedure using both
positive and negative controls.
• Review sequencing quality metrics to ensure they meet the
laboratory’s predefined standards.
• Re-run samples or steps if QC metrics fall outside acceptable
ranges.
