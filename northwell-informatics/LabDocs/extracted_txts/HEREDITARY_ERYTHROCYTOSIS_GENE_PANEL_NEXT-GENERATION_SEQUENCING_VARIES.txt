Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase for HEREDITARY ERYTHROCYTOSIS GENE
PANEL, NEXT-GENERATION SEQUENCING
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to provide a detailed protocol for the
analytical phase of generating results for the HEREDITARY
ERYTHROCYTOSIS GENE PANEL using Next-Generation
Sequencing (NGS). This includes the processing of sequencing data,
variant calling, and result interpretation.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory staff and bioinformaticians
are responsible for executing this protocol and ensuring data
accuracy and validity. It is the duty of the laboratory director or
designated supervisor to review and verify the results before clinical
reporting.
2. DEFINITIONS
Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS): A high-throughput sequencing
method allowing for the simultaneous sequencing of multiple genes.
Variant Calling: The process of identifying variants from sequencing
data. Hereditary Erythrocytosis: A condition characterized by an
increased number of red blood cells due to genetic abnormalities.
3. PROCEDURE
Pre-Analysis:
• Ensure all equipment (sequencers, computers) and software
(alignment and analysis tools) are functioning and calibrated
according to manufacturer specifications.
• Verify that sample DNA quality and quantity meet established
laboratory criteria.
A. Sequencing Data Generation:
1. Library Preparation:
◦ Follow the library preparation protocol specific to the NGS
platform in use.
◦ Ensure proper indexing of samples to allow for multiplexing.
2. Sequencing Run:
◦ Load prepared libraries onto the NGS instrument.
◦ Execute sequencing run according to the platform’s
operation manual.
3. Quality Check:
◦ Verify raw sequencing data quality using metrics such as
Q30 scores, base call quality, and overall sequencing depth.
◦ If data do not meet quality thresholds, troubleshoot, and
potentially re-run samples.
B. Data Alignment and Processing:
1. Data Alignment:
◦ Use appropriate bioinformatics software (e.g., BWA, Bowtie)
to align sequencing reads to the human reference genome
(e.g., hg38).
◦ Confirm that more than 90-95% of reads align to the
reference genome with high confidence.
2. Duplicate Removal:
◦ Use tools such as Picard or SAMtools to identify and
remove PCR duplicates.
3. Base Quality Recalibration:
◦ Apply base quality score recalibration (BQSR) using GATK
or equivalent software to correct any systematic errors
made by the sequencing platform.
C. Variant Calling:
1. Call Variants:
◦ Utilize a variant caller (e.g., GATK HaplotypeCaller,
FreeBayes) to detect single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and
small insertions/deletions (indels) in the target genes.
◦ Set parameters for variant calling, such as minimum base
quality and read depth.
2. Variant Filtering:
◦ Apply filtering criteria to refine variant list (e.g., remove
variants below 20x coverage, low-quality scores, or those
present in more than 1% frequency in population databases
like gnomAD).
D. Variant Annotation and Interpretation:
1. Variant Annotation:
◦ Annotate variants using tools like ANNOVAR or SnpEff to
add information on gene function, potential pathogenicity,
and population frequency.
2. Clinical Interpretation:
◦ Compare identified variants with known pathogenic variants
in databases (e.g., ClinVar, Human Gene Mutation
Database (HGMD)).
◦ Follow ACMG/AMP guidelines for variant classification
(pathogenic, likely pathogenic, VUS, likely benign, benign).
3. Generate Report:
◦ Summarize findings in a structured clinical report, including
details about the identified variants, their potential clinical
significance, and recommendations.
◦ Include methodology and limitations of the test.
E. Data Review and Validation:
1. Review Results:
◦ Have two independent reviewers (one bioinformatician and
one clinical molecular geneticist) check the results for
accuracy and concordance.
2. Verification:
◦ Perform verification of clinically significant variants using an
orthogonal method if necessary (e.g., Sanger Sequencing).
3. Documentation:
◦ Document all analysis steps, review comments, and
verification results in the Laboratory Information
Management System (LIMS).
4. QUALITY CONTROL
• Conduct regular quality assessments on sequencing runs and
data processing steps.
• Participate in external proficiency testing programs for NGS.
• Maintain and review corrective action records for any
discrepancies or errors encountered during the process.
5. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results are uploaded to the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
and are reviewed and verified by a senior technologist or
laboratory director.
• Critical findings are reported to the requesting clinician via secure
channels and documented accordingly.
6. REFERENCES
• Specific NGS platform manuals and protocols.
• ACMG/AMP Guidelines for the Interpretation of Sequence
Variants.
• Bioinformatics tools user manuals and documentation.
• Relevant scientific literature and clinical guidelines for hereditary
erythrocytosis.
7. DOCUMENT CONTROL
• Maintain a record of all versions of this SOP.
• Ensure all staff members are trained on the current version.
• Regularly review and update the SOP to incorporate new
technologies, methodologies, and regulatory requirements.
