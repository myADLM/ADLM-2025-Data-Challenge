Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Analytical Phase for
Hereditary Erythrocytosis Mutations, Whole Blood
1. PURPOSE
To detail the steps required for the analytical phase of testing whole
blood specimens for hereditary erythrocytosis mutations, ensuring
accurate and reliable results.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the
analytical tests as defined in this procedure. Supervisors are
responsible for ensuring that the procedures are followed correctly
and for addressing any issues that may arise.
2. DEFINITION
Hereditary erythrocytosis (familial polycythemia) is a condition
characterized by an increased red blood cell mass. Genetic testing
can identify mutations associated with this condition in whole blood
specimens.
3. MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT
• Whole blood specimen (pre-collection protocols adhered)
• DNA extraction kit (e.g., QIAGEN DNA Blood Mini Kit)
• PCR reagents and supplies (primers, Taq polymerase, dNTPs,
buffer)
• Agarose gel electrophoresis equipment
• Sequencing equipment (e.g., Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS)
platform or Sanger sequencing kit)
• Thermocycler
• UV transilluminator
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Ethanol (70%)
• Laboratory computer with access to necessary software
4. PROCEDURES
A) DNA Extraction
1. Preparation:
◦ Wear appropriate PPE including gloves and lab coat.
◦ Verify the identity of the specimen with accession number.
2. Extraction Protocol:
◦ Aliquot 200 µL of whole blood into a sterile microcentrifuge
tube.
◦ Follow manufacturer’s instructions for DNA extraction using
the DNA Blood Mini Kit.
◦ Elute DNA in a final volume of 50 µL.
◦ Quantify DNA using a spectrophotometer or fluorometer,
and assess purity. Record the concentration and purity
ratios (A260/280).
B) PCR Amplification
1. Preparation:
◦ Design or confirm the appropriate primers for the mutation
targets of interest.
◦ Set up the PCR reaction mix according to the optimized
protocol (e.g., 1X buffer, 0.2 mM dNTPs, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.5
µM each primer, 1 U Taq polymerase, template DNA).
2. Amplification Protocol:
◦ Place reaction tubes in the thermocycler and run the PCR
program according to the optimized parameters (e.g., Initial
denaturation: 95°C for 3 min, 35 cycles of 95°C for 30 s,
58°C for 30 s, 72°C for 1 min, Final extension: 72°C for 5
min).
◦ Store amplified products at 4°C until further processing.
C) Gel Electrophoresis
1. Preparation:
◦ Prepare a 2% agarose gel with appropriate buffer (e.g., TAE
or TBE).
◦ Load PCR products into the gel along with a DNA ladder.
2. Electrophoresis Protocol:
◦ Run the gel at 100 V for 30-45 minutes.
◦ Visualize bands using a UV transilluminator.
◦ Document the results by photographing the gel.
D) Sequencing
1. Preparation:
◦ Purify PCR products using a purification kit or protocol (e.g.,
QIAGEN PCR Purification Kit).
2. Sequencing Protocol:
◦ Set up a sequencing reaction according to manufacturer’s
instructions (e.g., BigDye Terminator v3.1 cycle sequencing
kit).
◦ Perform the sequencing reaction in the thermocycler (initial
denaturation at 95°C for 1 min followed by 25 cycles of 95°C
for 10 s, 50°C for 10 s, and 60°C for 4 min).
◦ Purify the sequencing products and load them onto the
sequencing platform.
◦ Analyze the sequence data using appropriate software (e.g.,
Sequencer, BioEdit).
E) Data Analysis and Interpretation
1. Data Review:
◦ Review raw sequencing data for quality and accuracy.
◦ Align sequences against reference sequences using
software (e.g., BLAST, Clustal Omega).
2. Interpretation:
◦ Identify mutations and assess their relevance based on
known databases (e.g., ClinVar, OMIM).
◦ Document findings in the laboratory information system
(LIS).
5. REPORTING RESULTS
Results must be reviewed, verified, and documented by the
technologist. Include findings such as identified mutations, potential
impacts, and recommended follow-up if necessary.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Regular Checks:
◦ Perform quality control tests using known positive and
negative controls.
◦ Ensure equipment calibration and maintenance logs are up
to date.
2. Verification:
◦ Compare results across different methodologies if applicable
(e.g., confirmatory sequencing).
◦ Address discrepancies according to laboratory policy.
