SOP for the Analytical Phase of Generating Results for
HEREDITARY EXPANDED CANCER PANEL, VARIES
1. PURPOSE
This procedure outlines the steps for analyzing and generating
results for the HEREDITARY EXPANDED CANCER PANEL using
next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology. This panel tests for
genetic mutations associated with a predisposition to various types of
hereditary cancers. The purpose is to ensure that the analytical
phase is performed accurately and consistently, providing reliable
and reproducible results.
2. SCOPE
This protocol applies to all laboratory personnel involved in the
analytical phase of hereditary cancer panel testing. This includes
sample preparation, sequencing, and data analysis.
3. DEFINITIONS
• Hereditary Expanded Cancer Panel: A panel of genes
associated with an increased risk for various cancers.
• NGS: Next-generation sequencing technology used to determine
the sequence of nucleotides in a DNA sample.
• Bioinformatics Pipeline: A computational process that analyzes
NGS data to identify genetic variants.
4. RESPONSIBILITY
• Laboratory Technicians/Technologists: Responsible for
performing the DNA extraction, library preparation, sequencing,
and initial quality control checks.
• Bioinformaticians: Responsible for performing the computational
analysis of sequencing data, including alignment, variant calling,
and annotation.
• Supervisors/Managers: Responsible for the oversight of the
analytical process, ensuring that all steps are performed
according to the SOP and that corrective actions are documented
and implemented when necessary.
5. PROCEDURE
A) Sample Preparation
1. DNA Extraction
◦ Extract DNA from the received specimen using an
appropriate extraction kit. Ensure to work under aseptic
conditions to avoid contamination.
◦ Measure DNA concentration and purity using
spectrophotometry (e.g., NanoDrop) and fluorometry (e.g.,
Qubit).
2. DNA Library Preparation
◦ Prepare DNA libraries using the designated library
preparation kit. Follow the manufacturer's instructions.
◦ Perform quality control checks on the libraries using a
Bioanalyzer or TapeStation.
B) Sequencing
1. Set Up Sequencing Run
◦ Load the prepared libraries onto the sequencing platform
(e.g., Illumina, Thermo Fisher).
◦ Configure the sequencing run parameters according to the
specifications required for the HEREDITARY EXPANDED
CANCER PANEL.
2. Monitor Sequencing Run
◦ Regularly monitor the sequencing run to ensure it is
proceeding as expected.
◦ Document any deviations or issues that occur during the run
in the sequencing log.
C) Data Analysis
1. Raw Data Processing
◦ Transfer the raw sequencing data (FASTQ files) to the
bioinformatics pipeline.
◦ Perform quality control checks on the raw sequencing data
using tools such as FastQC.
2. Sequence Alignment
◦ Align the sequencing reads to the human reference genome
(e.g., GRCh38) using a suitable aligner (e.g., BWA,
Bowtie2).
3. Variant Calling
◦ Call variants using a variant caller (e.g., GATK, FreeBayes)
to identify single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and small
insertions/deletions (indels).
4. Variant Annotation
◦ Annotate the identified variants using a comprehensive
annotation tool (e.g., ANNOVAR, VEP) to determine their
potential clinical relevance.
D) Quality Control and Validation
1. Review Results
◦ Review the variant calls and annotated data for accuracy
and completeness.
◦ Compare the results with internal and external control
samples to ensure consistency and reliability.
2. Clinical Interpretation
◦ Interpret the identified variants in the context of hereditary
cancer risk. Consult relevant databases (e.g., ClinVar,
HGMD) and literature as necessary.
3. Report Generation
◦ Generate a comprehensive report detailing the findings and
their potential clinical significance.
◦ Ensure the report is reviewed and signed off by a qualified
clinical geneticist or pathologist.
E) Documentation and Reporting
1. Document Control
◦ Maintain detailed records of all analytical steps, including
DNA extraction, library preparation, sequencing run
configuration, and data analysis.
◦ Document any corrective actions taken and the outcomes.
2. Result Reporting
◦ Report results to the ordering physician or clinician through
the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
◦ Ensure that results are communicated clearly and promptly.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform regular quality control checks and validation exercises to
ensure the NGS platform and bioinformatics pipeline are
performing optimally.
• Participate in external proficiency testing programs to maintain
compliance with CLIA guidelines.
