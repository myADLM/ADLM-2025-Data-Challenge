Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Hereditary Gastrointestinal Cancer
Panel, Varies
1. PURPOSE
This SOP delineates the procedure for the analysis and
generation of results for the Hereditary Gastrointestinal Cancer
Panel. This includes pre-analytical and post-analytical
processes, ensuring accuracy and reproducibility of test results.
Responsibility:
Qualified laboratory personnel are responsible for conducting
the tests, analyzing the data, and ensuring results are
documented and reported accurately. Supervisors are to
oversee the process and ensure compliance with the procedure
outlined.
2. DEFINITIONS
Hereditary Gastrointestinal Cancer Panel: A multi-gene panel
designed to detect genetic mutations associated with hereditary
gastrointestinal cancers.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND MATERIALS
a. Equipment:
◦ DNA extraction kits
◦ Quantification instruments (e.g., Qubit or Nanodrop)
◦ PCR thermocyclers
◦ Next-generation sequencing (NGS) platforms (e.g., Illumina
MiSeq)
◦ Bioinformatics analysis software
◦ Centrifuges
b. Reagents:
◦ NGS library preparation kits
◦ PCR reagents
◦ Sequencing reagents (e.g., Illumina TruSight panels)
◦ Reference materials and controls
c. Materials:
◦ Microcentrifuge tubes
◦ Pipettes and filter tips
◦ Thermal cycler plates and seals
◦ Sequencing flow cells
4. PROCEDURE
a. DNA Extraction:
◦ Using the appropriate DNA extraction kit, extract DNA from
the received specimens as per manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Quantify and assess the quality of extracted DNA using a
Qubit or similar quantification tool. Ensure concentration and
purity meet the established criteria (e.g., A260/280 ratio of
1.8-2.0).
b. Library Preparation:
◦ Prepare the DNA libraries using the designated NGS library
preparation kit, following the manufacturer's protocol.
◦ Perform sample normalization and pooling as required by
the sequencing platform. Ensure proper documentation of
sample IDs and positions in the library preparation
spreadsheets.
c. PCR Amplification:
◦ Amplify the target regions using specific PCR primers and
conditions optimized for the Hereditary Gastrointestinal
Cancer Panel.
◦ Check PCR products using agarose gel electrophoresis (if
needed) for verification of correct amplification.
d. Sequencing:
◦ Load the libraries onto the sequencing instrument. Follow
the instrument-specific loading and sequencing protocols.
◦ Monitor the run to ensure it proceeds smoothly and within
the expected parameters.
e. Data Analysis:
◦ Use associated bioinformatics software to analyze
sequencing data.
◦ Perform alignment of reads to the reference genome and
identify variants.
◦ Annotate detected variants according to clinical significance
using established databases (e.g., ClinVar) and relevant
guidelines.
f. Quality Control:
◦ Include positive and negative controls in each round of
library preparation, sequencing, and data analysis.
◦ Review quality metrics (e.g., coverage depth, variant quality
scores) to ensure data meets pre-determined quality
standards.
◦ Address any deviations from the expected parameters by
repeating the relevant steps or notifying the supervisor.
5. REPORT GENERATION
a. Interpretation of Data:
◦ Review the annotated variants and correlate with clinical
information to interpret the significance of findings.
◦ Document the findings in the patient's laboratory report,
including the pathogenicity of variants and relevant clinical
recommendations.
b. Clinical Reporting:
◦ Generate a comprehensive clinical report that includes:
▪ Patient information and specimen details
▪ Indication for testing
▪ Methods and results of the analysis
▪ Interpretation of findings, including clinical
recommendations
▪ Any limitations of the test
c. Verification and Sign-off:
◦ The report must be reviewed and interpreted by a board-
certified geneticist or pathologist.
◦ Ensure all findings are validated and the report is signed off
by an authorized personnel before releasing to the ordering
physician.
6. DOCUMENTATION AND RECORD KEEPING
◦ Maintain detailed records of all analytical procedures,
instrument run logs, and quality control data.
◦ Store copies of final reports and raw data in a secure,
backed-up system for future reference, complying with local
regulations on data retention and privacy.
