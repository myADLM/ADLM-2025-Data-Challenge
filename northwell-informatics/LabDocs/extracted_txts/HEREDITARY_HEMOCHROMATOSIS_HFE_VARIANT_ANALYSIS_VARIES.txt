Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase:
HEREDITARY HEMOCHROMATOSIS, HFE VARIANT ANALYSIS
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the analysis of the HFE
gene variants commonly associated with Hereditary
Hemochromatosis, ensuring accurate and reliable results are
obtained.
Responsibility:
• It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory staff to perform
the HFE variant analysis following the procedure outlined below.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring that staff are properly
trained and that quality control measures are adhered to during
the testing process.
1. DEFINITIONS
Hereditary Hemochromatosis: A genetic disorder characterized by
excessive absorption of iron, leading to iron overload and potential
damage to organs.
HFE Gene: The gene associated with Hereditary Hemochromatosis,
specifically the variants C282Y, H63D, and S65C.
1. PROCEDURE
Step 1: Sample Preparation
• Specimen Requirements and Stability
◦ Whole blood collected in EDTA tubes (purple-top) is required
for DNA extraction.
◦ Specimens are stable at 2-8°C for up to 7 days. For long-term
storage, extracted DNA may be stored at -20°C.
• Unacceptable Specimens
◦ Specimens collected in wrong anticoagulants or in containers
with significant leakage.
◦ Specimens with insufficient volume or hemolyzed samples.
Step 2: DNA Extraction
• Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies
◦ DNA extraction kits (e.g., Qiagen, Promega)
◦ Microcentrifuge, pipettes, and sterile pipette tips
◦ Vortex mixer
• Procedure
1. Follow the manufacturer’s protocol for DNA extraction from
whole blood.
2. Quantify the extracted DNA using a spectrophotometer
(e.g., NanoDrop) and ensure DNA concentration is suitable
for PCR.
Step 3: PCR Amplification
• Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies
◦ PCR thermocycler
◦ PCR master mix (containing dNTPs, MgCl2, Taq polymerase,
and buffer)
◦ Primers specific for HFE variants (C282Y, H63D, S65C)
◦ Nuclease-free water
• Procedure
1. Prepare the PCR reaction mix according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Add template DNA to the reaction mix.
3. Program the thermocycler with cycling conditions specific for
the HFE primers.
4. Run the PCR cycle and verify amplification by gel
electrophoresis.
Step 4: Gel Electrophoresis
• Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies
◦ Agarose gel and electrophoresis unit
◦ Gel casting trays
◦ Ethidium bromide or other DNA stains
◦ UV transilluminator
• Procedure
1. Prepare agarose gel and load PCR products into wells.
2. Run electrophoresis at the chosen voltage for sufficient
separation.
3. Stain the gel and visualize DNA bands using the UV
transilluminator.
Step 5: Post-PCR Analysis
• Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies
◦ Restriction enzymes if RFLP analysis is required
◦ Sequencing equipment (e.g. Sanger or next-generation
sequencing platforms)
• Procedure
1. If sequence-specific restriction analysis is required, digest
PCR products and analyze via gel electrophoresis.
2. For direct sequencing, purify PCR products and perform
sequencing following the manufacturer’s protocol.
3. Analyze sequence data using appropriate bioinformatics
tools to determine the presence of HFE gene variants.
Step 6: Quality Control
• Material
◦ Positive controls (known HFE variant carriers)
◦ Negative controls (wild-type samples)
• Procedure
1. Include positive and negative controls in each batch of PCR
reactions.
2. Verify control results to ensure the accuracy of variant
detection.
3. Record and review all QC data for compliance with
laboratory standards.
Step 7: Reporting Results
• Procedure
1. Interpret variant analysis results based on sequencing or
restriction digest patterns.
2. Verify all data before entering into the Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
3. Review and approve results for release following site-
specific reporting guidelines.
Reference Intervals (Genes and Variants):
• C282Y: Homozygous, Heterozygous, Wild Type
• H63D: Homozygous, Heterozygous, Wild Type
• S65C: Homozygous, Heterozygous, Wild Type
Method Limitations:
• False negatives may occur due to primer mismatches or poor
DNA quality.
• Refer to kit inserts and sequencing platform documentation for
additional limitations.

sequencing kits
Quality Assurance and Compliance
Ensure compliance with relevant regulations and guidelines,
including CLIA certification requirements. Regular proficiency testing
and internal audits should be conducted to maintain high standards
of accuracy and reliability in the analytical phase of HFE variant
analysis.
