ANEMIA GENE PANEL Using Next-
Generation Sequencing
1. PURPOSE
To provide standardized procedures for the analysis of the
HEREDITARY HEMOLYTIC ANEMIA GENE PANEL using Next-
Generation Sequencing (NGS) to ensure consistent, accurate, and
reproducible results.
1. SCOPE
This protocol applies to the analytical phase of generating results for
the HEREDITARY HEMOLYTIC ANEMIA GENE PANEL, including
the preparation, sequencing, data analysis, and result reporting.
1. RESPONSIBILITIES
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing and
documenting all steps in this procedure. It is the responsibility of all
staff to identify any issues that may affect test results and report them
to a supervisor.
1. MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT
• DNA Extraction Kit
• Quantitative and Qualitative DNA Assessment Equipment (e.g.,
Qubit, NanoDrop, Bioanalyzer)
• Next-Generation Sequencing System (e.g., Illumina, Ion Torrent)
• Reagents for Library Preparation (e.g., Illumina TruSeq, Ion
Torrent Ampliseq)
• Amplification and Sequencing Primers specific to the gene panel
• Bioinformatics Tools and Software for Data Analysis (e.g., BWA,
GATK, VarSeq)
• Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS)
1. PROCEDURE
A. DNA Extraction and Quality Control
1. DNA Extraction
◦ Extract DNA from the specimen using the designated DNA
extraction kit following the manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Store the DNA at -20°C until ready for quality control (QC)
and library preparation.
2. Quality Control of DNA
◦ Quantify DNA concentration using Qubit and check purity
with NanoDrop.
◦ Assess DNA integrity with Bioanalyzer or agarose gel
electrophoresis.
B. Library Preparation
1. Fragment DNA
◦ Depending on the sequencing platform, fragment the DNA
to the appropriate size range (e.g., 150-300 bp).
2. Library Preparation
◦ Perform end-repair, A-tailing, and adapter ligation according
to the library preparation kit protocol.
◦ Purify the ligated DNA fragments using magnetic beads or
column purification.
3. Amplification
◦ Amplify the library with primers specific to the HEREDITARY
HEMOLYTIC ANEMIA GENE PANEL.
◦ Perform PCR enrichment and purification of the amplified
products.
4. Quality Control of Library
◦ Quantify the library using Qubit or similar quantification
methods.
◦ Assess the size distribution of the library using Bioanalyzer.
C. Sequencing
1. Load Sequencing Platform
◦ Load prepared libraries onto the sequencing platform
following the manufacturer’s protocols.
◦ Perform cluster generation or template preparation as
required by the sequencing system.
2. Run Sequencing
◦ Initiate the sequencing run and monitor the process for any
errors or issues.
D. Data Analysis
1. Data Transfer
◦ Transfer raw sequence data to the designated
bioinformatics server for further analysis.
2. Quality Control of Sequence Data
◦ Evaluate the quality of the raw reads using quality control
software (e.g., FastQC).
3. Alignment and Variant Calling
◦ Align reads to the human reference genome (e.g., hg19 or
hg38) using software such as BWA.
◦ Call variants using tools like GATK.
4. Annotation and Interpretation
◦ Annotate detected variants with clinical significance using
databases and annotation tools (e.g., ClinVar, dbSNP).
◦ Interpret variants in the context of hereditary hemolytic
anemia following ACMG guidelines.
E. Reporting Results
1. Result Verification
◦ Verify all identified variants through a review process
involving bioinformaticians and geneticists.
◦ Ensure the accuracy and clinical relevance of reported
variants.
2. Result Documentation
◦ Document the sequence data and analysis results in the
LIMS.
◦ Generate a comprehensive report, including identified
variants and their clinical interpretation.
3. Communication of Results
◦ Report results to the referring clinician or authorized
personnel.
◦ Clearly document any limitations or uncertainties in the
report.
4. QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE
• Internal Quality Control
◦ Include known control samples in each run to validate the
sequencing and analysis pipeline.
◦ Monitor sequencing quality metrics and repeat runs if
necessary.
• Proficiency Testing
◦ Participate in external proficiency testing programs to ensure
ongoing assay performance.
