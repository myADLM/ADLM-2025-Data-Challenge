Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia and Vascular Malformations
Gene Panel Protocol
1. Purpose: This protocol outlines the procedures for the analytical
phase of generating results for the Hereditary Hemorrhagic
Telangiectasia (HHT) and Vascular Malformations Gene Panel.
This includes the steps to be taken from DNA extraction to the
interpretation of the results.
2. Specimen:
◦ Preferred: Fresh or frozen whole blood collected in EDTA
tubes, buccal swabs, or tissue samples.
◦ Acceptable: Fresh or frozen saliva samples.
◦ Unacceptable: Specimens that are hemolyzed, clotted, or
collected in preservatives other than EDTA.
3. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies:
◦ DNA extraction kit (e.g., Qiagen DNA Blood Mini Kit)
◦ PCR reagents (e.g., primers, Taq polymerase, dNTPs)
◦ Next-generation sequencing (NGS) platform (e.g., Illumina
MiSeq, Ion Torrent)
◦ Gel electrophoresis apparatus
◦ Bioinformatics software for NGS data analysis (e.g., GATK,
VarScan)
◦ Reference databases (e.g., ClinVar, HGMD)
4. Procedure: A) DNA Extraction:
◦ Proceed with DNA extraction using the chosen DNA
extraction kit following manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Quantify and assess the quality of the DNA using a
spectrophotometer and agarose gel electrophoresis.
◦ Store extracted DNA at -20°C until ready for PCR
amplification.
B) PCR Amplification:
◦ Design and validate primers specific to the genes
associated with HHT and Vascular Malformations (e.g.,
ACVRL1, ENG, SMAD4, GDF2).
◦ Set up PCR reactions using the extracted DNA, primers, Taq
polymerase, and dNTPs.
◦ Perform PCR amplification under optimized conditions (e.g.,
initial denaturation at 95°C for 2 minutes, followed by 35
cycles of 95°C for 30 seconds, 58°C for 30 seconds, and
72°C for 1 minute, with a final extension at 72°C for 5
minutes).
◦ Confirm successful amplification by loading samples onto
agarose gel electrophoresis and visualize bands under UV
light.
C) Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS):
◦ Prepare libraries from PCR products using an appropriate
library preparation kit.
◦ Perform sequencing on the selected NGS platform following
the manufacturer's protocol.
◦ Ensure adequate coverage and read depth for target genes.
D) Bioinformatics Analysis:
◦ Align raw sequence data to the reference genome using
appropriate software (e.g., BWA).
◦ Call variants using bioinformatics tools (e.g., GATK,
VarScan).
◦ Annotate and filter variants using reference databases (e.g.,
ClinVar, HGMD).
◦ Use software tools to predict the functional impact of
variants (e.g., SIFT, PolyPhen).
E) Interpretation and Reporting:
◦ Review the filtered variant list for known pathogenic, likely
pathogenic, and variants of uncertain significance (VUS).
◦ Cross-reference findings with clinical information and family
history, when available.
◦ Prepare a report outlining the identified variants and their
possible clinical significance.
◦ Include recommendations for further confirmatory testing or
genetic counseling as needed.
5. Quality Control:
◦ Run positive and negative controls with each batch of
samples.
◦ Perform intra-laboratory comparisons periodically to ensure
consistency and accuracy.
◦ Validate new batches of reagents and verify their
performance.
◦ Maintain documentation of quality control checks and
corrective actions taken, if any.
6. Reference Intervals:
◦ Reference intervals are not applicable for genetic testing;
however, identified variants should be interpreted in the
context of available clinical data and literature.
7. Method Limitations:
◦ Variants outside the target regions or with insufficient read
depth may not be detected.
◦ Variant interpretation may be limited by incomplete or
evolving knowledge of gene-disease relationships.
◦ Possible laboratory errors due to contamination, technical
issues, or insufficient quality control.
