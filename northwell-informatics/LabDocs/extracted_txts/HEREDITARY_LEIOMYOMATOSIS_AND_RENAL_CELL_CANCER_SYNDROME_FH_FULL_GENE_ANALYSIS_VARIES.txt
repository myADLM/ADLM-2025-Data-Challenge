STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP) HEREDITARY
LEIOMYOMATOSIS AND RENAL CELL CANCER SYNDROME
(HLRCC), FH, FULL GENE ANALYSIS
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedures for the analytical phase of generating
results for FH full gene analysis in the context of Hereditary
Leiomyomatosis and Renal Cell Cancer Syndrome (HLRCC). This
protocol ensures accurate, reliable, and timely results for genetic
variants in the FH gene.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the designated molecular laboratory
personnel to carry out the procedures outlined in this SOP. This
includes performing testing, analyzing data, and reporting results. It is
also the responsibility of supervisors to ensure that all staff are
adequately trained and compliance with this procedure is maintained.
1. DEFINITIONS
FH gene: Fumarate hydratase gene associated with HLRCC. Next-
Generation Sequencing (NGS): Advanced sequencing technology
that allows rapid sequencing of large sections of DNA. Sanger
Sequencing: A method used for DNA sequencing that relies on the
incorporation of chain-terminating dideoxynucleotides by DNA
polymerase during in vitro DNA replication. PCR: Polymerase Chain
Reaction, a technique to amplify DNA segments.
1. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS
All laboratory personnel must wear appropriate personal protective
equipment (PPE) at all times. Ensure proper disposal of waste
materials, including used reagents and samples, according to the
laboratory’s waste disposal policy. Work in a designated area to
prevent contamination and ensure sample integrity.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type: DNA extracted from peripheral blood, saliva, or
tissue. Quantity: Minimum 200 ng of DNA per sample. Quality: DNA
should be free of contaminants and appropriately quantified using a
fluorometric method (e.g., Qubit). Storage: Store DNA at -20°C or
below until analysis.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
NGS library preparation kit DNA polymerase Primer sets for PCR
amplification Thermocycler Validated and calibrated sequencing
platform (e.g., Illumina, Ion Torrent) Automated NGS data analysis
software Sanger sequencing reagents (for confirmation of variants)
Capillary electrophoresis system (for Sanger sequencing) Positive
and negative controls Pipettes and tips PCR tubes and plates
Centrifuge
1. PROCEDURE
7.1 DNA Quality Check
Quantify the DNA using a Qubit fluorometer. Assess DNA quality by
performing gel electrophoresis. Document quality and quantity results
in the laboratory information system (LIS).
7.2 NGS Library Preparation
Follow the NGS library preparation kit protocol to create sequencing
libraries from the extracted DNA. Assess library quality and
concentration using a bioanalyzer or a similar instrument.
7.3 NGS Sequencing
Load prepared libraries into the validated NGS platform. Set up the
sequencing run according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Monitor
the run regularly and document any deviations or issues encountered
in the LIS.
7.4 NGS Data Analysis
Upload sequencing data to data analysis software. Perform
alignment of sequences to the reference genome (GRCh38 or latest
version). Identify variants using variant caller software and annotate
them using population and clinical databases (e.g., dbSNP, ClinVar).
Generate a variants report including variant type, position, and
predicted impact. Confirm the presence of pathogenic or likely
pathogenic variants using Sanger sequencing.
7.5 Sanger Sequencing
Design gene-specific primers for the region of interest. Perform PCR
amplification of the target regions. Purify PCR products and set up
Sanger sequencing reactions. Run the reactions on a capillary
electrophoresis system. Analyze sequencing results to confirm the
presence or absence of identified variants.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
Include positive and negative controls in each batch of tests. Monitor
and document all QC results. If QC results fall outside of acceptable
limits, do not release patient results until the issue is resolved. Verify
the accuracy of variant calling by reanalyzing a subset of positive
control samples every six months.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
Review all analytical data to ensure accuracy and completeness.
Preparation of a patient results report detailing identified variants,
their clinical significance, and recommendations for follow-up. All
reports must be reviewed and signed off by a qualified molecular
geneticist before release. Critical findings must be communicated to
the referring physician immediately following standard laboratory
protocols.
1. DOCUMENTATION
Maintain all records of procedures, including raw data, quality control
results, and final reports for a minimum of 10 years. Ensure
documentation complies with regulatory and accreditation
requirements.
1. REFERENCES
Include references to relevant scientific literature, guidelines, and kit
manuals used in the development of this SOP.
By following this protocol, laboratory personnel will ensure the
provision of accurate and reliable FH gene analysis results, aiding in
the diagnosis and management of Hereditary Leiomyomatosis and
Renal Cell Cancer Syndrome.
