STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE FOR THE ANALYTICAL
PHASE OF HEREDITARY PANCREATIC CANCER PANEL
1. PURPOSE To outline the detailed procedure for analyzing patient
specimens for hereditary pancreatic cancer panel testing and
ensuring the consistent generation of accurate and reliable results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY Designated and trained laboratory scientists
are responsible for performing this procedure, ensuring proper
equipment functionality and adherence to the guidelines.
3. PRINCIPLE The hereditary pancreatic cancer panel involves the
genetic analysis of specific genes known to be associated with an
increased risk of pancreatic cancer. This includes the steps of DNA
extraction, amplification, sequencing, data analysis, and result
generation.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS Preferred Specimen:
• Peripheral blood: Collected in EDTA tubes (lavender top).
◦ Volume: 5-10 mL.
◦ Transport: Refrigerated or at room temperature; should arrive
in the lab within 24-48 hours.
• Buccal swabs: Follow specific storage and transport guidelines.
◦ Volume: As per the manufacturer’s instructions.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens clotted or hemolytic.
• Specimens collected in heparin tubes.
• Specimens not transported or stored under appropriate conditions
as per the guidelines.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Thermal cycler for PCR
• DNA extraction kit (such as QIAGEN)
• Next-generation sequencer
• PCR master mix and reagents
• Nucleotide sequencing reagents
• DNA quantification equipment (e.g., NanoDrop
spectrophotometer)
• Positive and negative control DNA
6. PROCEDURE
A) Specimen Handling and DNA Extraction:
1. Verify that specimen labeling matches the accession number
and requisition form.
2. Log the specimen into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
3. Extract DNA following the protocol described in the DNA
extraction kit. Ensure an adequate concentration of DNA is
obtained.
4. Document the DNA extraction procedure, including volume,
concentration, and any deviations in a dedicated logbook.
B) PCR Amplification:
1. Set up the PCR reaction with specific primers for the genes
included in the hereditary pancreatic cancer panel.
2. Prepare the master mix as per the manufacturer's instructions
using the following components:
◦ DNA template: 10-50 ng
◦ Primers: gene-specific sets
◦ dNTPs, Taq polymerase, buffer, MgCl2: As described by
PCR kit instructions.
3. Place the PCR tubes in the thermal cycler, and run the program
according to the validated cycling conditions for the genes in
the panel.
4. Perform a quality check of PCR products using gel
electrophoresis.
C) Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS):
1. Prepare the PCR products for sequencing according to the
NGS library preparation protocol.
2. Quantify the libraries and ensure they meet the quality
threshold.
3. Pool the samples, load onto the sequencing platform, and
initiate the sequencing run. Follow the manufacturer’s
guidelines for the specific NGS platform.
D) Data Analysis:
1. Transfer the sequencing data to the bioinformatics pipeline for
analysis.
2. Use bioinformatics tools and resources, such as alignment
software, to identify variants in the targeted genes.
3. Annotate variants regarding their pathogenicity using databases
like ClinVar and multiple computational prediction tools.
4. Perform quality control checks to verify the accuracy of the
analysis.
E) Interpretation and Reporting:
1. Correlate genetic findings with clinical data provided.
2. Interpret results based on identified variants' clinical relevance
using established guidelines.
3. Generate a comprehensive report, including the following:
◦ Summary of the analysis and findings.
◦ Detailed description of detected variants and their clinical
implications.
◦ Recommendations for follow-up testing or genetic
counseling.
7. QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE
Internal Quality Control (IQC):
1. Process positive and negative control with every batch of
patient samples.
2. Run known control DNA samples to validate the entire process
from DNA extraction to result interpretation.
3. All control results must fall within acceptable ranges as defined
by the laboratory’s quality control policy. Document all control
results.
External Quality Assessment (EQA):
1. Participate regularly in external proficiency testing programs
specific to hereditary cancer panels.
2. Evaluate and document EQA results and implement necessary
corrective actions if discrepancies are identified.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Review and verify results through the LIS.
2. Ensure double-checking and sign-off procedures by another
designated laboratory scientist.
3. Communicate critical findings to the referring physician
immediately.
4. Store reports securely following laboratory data security
guidelines.
9. REFERENCE INTERVALS AND LIMITATIONS
• Reference ranges and interpretations for genetic tests are specific
to detected variations and their known clinical significance.
Document variations as either pathogenic, likely pathogenic,
variant of uncertain significance, likely benign, or benign based on
guidelines.
• Knowledge regarding genetic variations constantly evolves.
Regular updates to the interpretation guidelines must be
incorporated.

• Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) Guidelines.
• Manufacturer instructions for all equipment and reagents.
• Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) protocols.
• Latest literature from peer-reviewed genetic research and
databases such as ClinVar, OMIM, and HGMD.
11. REVIEW AND REVISION
All procedures and protocols must be reviewed regularly, at least
annually, to remain compliant with current guidelines and scientific
advancements. This SOP should be distributed and adequately
communicated to all laboratory staff.
