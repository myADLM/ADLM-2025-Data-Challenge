Hereditary Pancreatitis Gene Panel SOP
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this protocol is to outline the steps involved in the
analytical phase for generating results for the Hereditary Pancreatitis
Gene Panel. This document ensures consistent and accurate results.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory technologists are responsible for
performing the analysis, interpreting data, and documenting
results as outlined in this procedure.
• The laboratory supervisor or director is responsible for reviewing
and validating the generated results.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
Specimen Types:
• Preferred: 3-5 mL whole blood in EDTA tubes (lavender top).
• Acceptable: Saliva collected into an Oragene DNA self-collection
kit.
Specimen Stability:
• Whole Blood: Stable at 2-8°C for up to 7 days; freeze at -20°C or
colder for long-term storage.
• Saliva: Room temperature storage up to 2 weeks; freeze at -20°C
or colder for long-term storage.
Specimen Rejection Criteria:
• Specimens lacking proper identification or labeling.
• Specimens collected in non-EDTA tubes or with anticoagulants
other than EDTA.
• Hemolyzed, clotted, or leaking specimens.
• Specimens received beyond stability limits.
1. PROCEDURE
A. DNA Extraction
1. Perform DNA extraction from the collected specimen using the
designated commercial DNA extraction kit.
2. Quantify DNA concentration using a spectrophotometer (e.g.,
NanoDrop).
3. Verify DNA integrity by running a sample on an agarose gel or
using a TapeStation analysis.
B. Library Preparation and PCR Amplification
1. Prepare sequencing libraries using a validated library
preparation protocol for gene panels.
2. Amplify target regions using specific primers designed for the
Hereditary Pancreatitis Gene Panel and include controls.
3. Purify PCR products to remove unincorporated primers and
nucleotides.
C. Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS)
1. Quantify and pool libraries to appropriate concentrations
required for sequencing.
2. Load libraries on the sequencing platform (e.g., Illumina MiSeq)
according to the manufacturer's instructions.
3. Monitor the sequencing process and troubleshoot any issues
that arise during the run.
D. Bioinformatics Analysis
1. Process sequencing data using an established bioinformatics
pipeline.
2. Align reads to the reference genome and call variants.
3. Filter and annotate variants using updated databases and
clinical guidelines.
4. RESULT INTERPRETATION AND REPORTING
A. Data Interpretation
1. Review variant calls and annotations, focusing on exonic and
splice site regions of CFTR, PRSS1, SPINK1, CTRC, CPA1,
etc.
2. Classify variants according to ACMG guidelines (e.g.,
pathogenic, likely pathogenic, benign, likely benign, VUS).
3. Compare findings with patient’s clinical information.
B. Quality Control
1. Confirm all detected variants through Sanger sequencing or
another orthogonal method as necessary.
2. Review sequencing run metrics and verify that they meet the
laboratory's quality standards.
3. Repeat analysis if QC metrics are not met or results are
inconclusive.
C. Reporting Results
1. Document all findings in the laboratory information system,
including:
◦ Patient identification and specimen details.
◦ Detailed result interpretation with clinical significance.
◦ Any limitations encountered during analysis.
2. Generate a comprehensive report that includes:
◦ Identified variants and their classification.
◦ Relevant literature references and database entries.
◦ Recommendations for further clinical action or testing if
applicable.
3. Submit the report for final review and approval by a geneticist
or laboratory director before release.
4. REFERENCES AND DOCUMENTATION
• ACMG Standards and Guidelines for the Interpretation of
Sequence Variants.
• Manufacturer's instructions for DNA extraction kit, library
preparation kit, and sequencing platform.
• Internal validation documents and quality control logs for
analytical procedures.
1. ADDITIONAL NOTES
• Integration with EHR systems for seamless result reporting.
• Maintain updated versions of all software and databases used in
the bioinformatics analysis.
This Hereditary Pancreatitis Gene Panel SOP ensures accurate and
reliable genetic testing to support clinical diagnosis and patient care.
