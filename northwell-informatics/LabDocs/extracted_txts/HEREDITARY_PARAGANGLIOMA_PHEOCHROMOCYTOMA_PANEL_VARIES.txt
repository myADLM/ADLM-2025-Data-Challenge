Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline procedures for the analytical
phase of testing for Hereditary Paraganglioma/Pheochromocytoma
Panel. This SOP ensures optimal quality, accuracy, and reliability of
results obtained through the analysis.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory staff are responsible for
performing all procedures as described in this SOP. All staff must
ensure compliance with the specified methods and promptly report
any discrepancies or issues to a supervisor.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred Specimen:
• Blood: 2-5 mL whole blood in an EDTA tube (lavender top).
Acceptable Specimen:
• Extracted DNA: A minimum of 2 µg of high-quality DNA with an
A260/280 ratio of 1.8-2.0.
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Hemolyzed blood samples
• Clotted blood samples
• Specimens not properly labeled or lacking adequate identification
1. PROCEDURE
A. DNA Extraction:
1. Follow the manufacturer's recommended procedure for DNA
extraction.
2. Measure DNA concentration using a spectrophotometer and
ensure purity (A260/280 ratio).
3. Store extracted DNA at -20°C until further analysis.
B. Library Preparation:
1. Use a validated library preparation kit designed for next-
generation sequencing (NGS) of the Hereditary Paraganglioma/
Pheochromocytoma Panel.
2. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for library preparation.
3. Quantify and validate libraries using a fluorometer and/or
qPCR.
4. Pool libraries to ensure equal representation of each sample.
C. Sequencing:
1. Load pooled libraries onto the sequencing platform as per the
manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Perform sequencing on a compatible NGS instrument (e.g.,
Illumina MiSeq or NextSeq).
3. Monitor the sequencing run to ensure quality metrics are met.
D. Data Analysis:
1. Transfer sequencing data files to the bioinformatics platform.
2. Use validated bioinformatics software to align sequencing reads
to the reference genome.
3. Perform variant calling to identify single nucleotide variants
(SNVs) and indels.
4. Annotate variants using a curated database of known
pathogenic and benign variants.
E. Interpretation of Results:
1. Review annotated variants for clinical significance.
2. Consider current literature, clinical databases, and in silico
prediction tools.
3. Classify variants according to established guidelines (e.g.,
ACMG standards) as pathogenic, likely pathogenic, VUS
(variant of uncertain significance), likely benign, or benign.
F. Quality Control:
1. Include positive and negative controls throughout DNA
extraction, library preparation, and sequencing.
2. Perform regular maintenance and calibration of equipment.
3. Implement periodic proficiency testing to maintain laboratory
accreditation.
4. Document all QC activities and review logs monthly.
5. RESULT REPORTING
A. Reporting:
1. Generate a comprehensive report summarizing all identified
variants and their clinical significance.
2. Verify the report for accuracy and completeness before release.
3. The report must include: a. Patient identification and sample
information b. List of identified variants with interpretation c.
Methodological details and references d. Any limitations of the
test
B. Communication:
1. Reports will be promptly communicated to the ordering
physician via secured electronic methods or hard copy delivery,
as requested.
2. Any critical findings will be communicated immediately by
phone followed by a formal report.
C. Record Keeping:
1. Store all records related to the Hereditary Paraganglioma/
Pheochromocytoma Panel testing for a minimum of 10 years.
2. Maintain records in both electronic and hard copy formats to
ensure availability.
