Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Hereditary Prostate Cancer Panel, Varies
1. Purpose This SOP outlines the procedures and guidelines for
the analytical phase of generating results for the Hereditary
Prostate Cancer Panel. This panel is designed to detect genetic
mutations associated with an increased risk of hereditary
prostate cancer. The aim is to ensure accurate, reliable, and
timely results through standardized laboratory practices.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the
analytical procedures as outlined in this protocol.
• It is the responsibility of all staff to adhere to these procedures
and report any deviations or issues to the supervising technologist
or laboratory manager.
1. Specimen Requirements
• Specimen Type: Blood sample collected in an EDTA tube.
• Volume: Minimum 3 mL of whole blood.
• Stability: Specimen must be processed within 48 hours of
collection. If delayed, refrigerate at 2-8°C.
• Specimen Labeling: All specimens must be labeled with patient
name, unique identifier, collection date, and time.
1. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies
• DNA Extraction Kit
• PCR Reagents: Primers, Taq Polymerase, dNTPs, Buffer
solutions
• Thermal Cycler
• Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) platform
• Bioinformatics software for data analysis
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
1. Procedure A) DNA Extraction
2. Confirm specimen integrity and labeling upon receipt.
3. Use the DNA Extraction Kit to extract genomic DNA from the
blood sample following the kit manufacturer’s instructions.
4. Quantify and assess the purity of the extracted DNA using a
spectrophotometer (A260/A280 ratio should be between 1.8
and 2.0).
5. Store extracted DNA at -20°C until ready for use.
B) Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)
1. Design and validate specific primers for the targeted genes
associated with hereditary prostate cancer (e.g., BRCA1,
BRCA2, HOXB13, etc.).
2. Prepare the PCR reaction mixture on ice, including DNA
template, primers, Taq Polymerase, dNTPs, and buffer.
3. Perform PCR in a thermal cycler with optimized cycling
conditions for each target gene.
4. Validate PCR amplification by running the products on an
agarose gel electrophoresis.
C) Next Generation Sequencing (NGS)
1. Prepare the PCR-amplified products for NGS library
preparation using a compatible kit.
2. Quantify and pool libraries based on standardized protocols.
3. Load pooled libraries onto the NGS platform according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
4. Run the sequencing experiment, ensuring all quality control
checks are met.
D) Data Analysis
1. Transfer NGS raw data to bioinformatics software.
2. Perform quality control checks on raw data including read
depth, coverage, and base quality.
3. Align sequences to the human reference genome and call
variants.
4. Filter and annotate variants to identify known mutations
associated with hereditary prostate cancer.
5. Validate identified variants using Sanger sequencing if
necessary.
6. Quality Control
• Include positive and negative controls in each batch of PCR and
NGS runs to ensure the accuracy and reliability of results.
• Regularly calibrate and maintain all equipment according to
manufacturer specifications.
• Document and review all steps of the process, including any
deviations and corrective actions taken.
1. Reporting Results
• Results should be reviewed by a qualified clinical geneticist or
molecular pathologist.
• Detailed reports will include identified variants, their clinical
significance, and potential implications for patient management.
• Any critical findings should be communicated to the referring
physician immediately.
1. Method Limitations
• The test may not detect all genetic variants associated with
hereditary prostate cancer.
• False negatives/positives may result from sample contamination,
technical errors, or low-quality DNA.
• Interpretation of variants should be done in the context of other
clinical findings and family history.
