Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Generating Results for
HEREDITARY RENAL CANCER PANEL, VARIES
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the protocol for the analytical
phase in generating results for the HEREDITARY RENAL CANCER
PANEL, VARIES. The protocol ensures that all steps are performed
accurately, consistently, and in compliance with regulatory standards,
thus ensuring high-quality and reliable results.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the
assay, monitoring equipment, and documenting quality control
measures.
• Supervisors are responsible for verifying that all steps are
followed and for addressing any issues that arise.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Equipment:
◦ Next-Generation Sequencer (NGS)
◦ Thermocycler
◦ Centrifuge
◦ Spectrophotometer
◦ Pipettes and tips
◦ Microcentrifuge tubes
• Reagents:
◦ DNA Extraction Kit
◦ Library Preparation Kit
◦ Sequencing Kit
◦ PCR reagents (primers, Taq polymerase, dNTPs)
◦ Quality Control reagents
• Supplies:
◦ Sterile gloves
◦ Lab coat
◦ Safety glasses
◦ Lab notebook
◦ Barcode labels
◦ Cleaning supplies (70% ethanol)
1. PROCEDURE
A) DNA Extraction:
1. Follow the DNA Extraction Kit protocol to extract genomic DNA
from the collected specimen.
2. Measure the DNA concentration and purity using a
spectrophotometer. Record the measured values.
3. Document the DNA concentration and purity in the lab
notebook.
B) Library Preparation:
1. Use the Library Preparation Kit to prepare DNA libraries for
sequencing, following the manufacturer’s protocol.
2. Perform quality control of the prepared libraries by running a
small aliquot on an agarose gel or using a fragment analyzer.
3. Document the library preparation steps and quality control
results.
C) Sequencing:
1. Load the prepared libraries into the Next-Generation Sequencer
following the instrument’s user manual.
2. Initiate the sequencing run and monitor the instrument during
this phase to ensure it is functioning properly.
3. Once the sequencing run is completed, download the raw
sequence data for analysis.
D) Data Analysis:
1. Transfer the raw sequence data to a bioinformatics workstation
or server.
2. Perform bioinformatics analysis using validated software tools
to identify variants associated with hereditary renal cancer.
3. Review and annotate the identified variants, interpreting their
clinical significance based on current databases and literature.
4. Document the data analysis workflow and results.
E) Quality Control:
1. Run quality control samples alongside patient samples to
ensure the accuracy and reliability of the results.
2. Any deviations from expected quality control results must be
reported immediately to the supervisor and documented.
3. Re-perform the analytical steps if quality control results do not
meet the acceptable criteria.
4. REPORTING RESULTS
5. Create a report summarizing the sequencing results and
identified variants.
6. Include the interpretation of the clinical significance of the
identified variants.
7. Review and verify the report by a qualified laboratory
professional.
8. Transmit the finalized report to the LIS (Laboratory Information
System) and ensure patient confidentiality and data integrity.
9. REFERENCE INTERVALS AND INTERPRETATION
• The interpretation of the identified variants will be based on
established guidelines and current literature.
• Variants will be classified and reported with respect to their
potential pathogenicity (e.g., benign, likely benign, uncertain
significance, likely pathogenic, pathogenic).
1. QUALITY ASSURANCE
• Regularly validate and calibrate all equipment used in the
process.
• Ensure all reagents and supplies are within their expiration dates
and stored as per the manufacturer's recommendations.
• Perform periodic competency assessments for the laboratory
personnel.
• Maintain updated and detailed documentation for all steps of the
procedure and any troubleshooting performed.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s manual and protocol for the DNA Extraction Kit,
Library Preparation Kit, and Sequencing Kit.
• Current CLIA, CAP, and other regulatory guidelines for genetic
testing.
• Relevant scientific literature and databases pertaining to
hereditary renal cancer.
This protocol ensures a standard approach to processing and
analyzing HEREDITARY RENAL CANCER PANEL tests, thus
providing consistent, accurate, and clinically relevant results.
