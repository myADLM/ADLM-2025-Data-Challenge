HEREDITARY THROMBOCYTOPENIA GENE PANEL, NEXT-
GENERATION SEQUENCING (NGS) PROTOCOL
1. Purpose: This document provides detailed step-by-step
procedures for the analytical phase of generating results for the
Hereditary Thrombocytopenia Gene Panel using Next-
Generation Sequencing (NGS). The protocol ensures accurate,
reliable, and reproducible results.
2. Scope: This protocol applies to all personnel performing NGS
for hereditary thrombocytopenia gene panel testing in the
laboratory.
3. Responsibilities: Designated staff are responsible for
performing NGS procedures as outlined in this protocol,
ensuring proper documentation, and notifying supervisors of
any irregularities or issues. All lab personnel must adhere to
this protocol and ensure adherence to quality control measures.
4. Equipment and Reagents:
• NGS platform (e.g., Illumina MiSeq, NextSeq, or equivalent)
• Reagents and consumables for DNA extraction (e.g., QIAamp
DNA Mini Kit)
• Library preparation kit (e.g., Illumina DNA Prep Kit)
• Custom or commercial hereditary thrombocytopenia gene panel
(enrichment kits)
• Quantification and quality assessment tools (e.g., Qubit
Fluorometer, TapeStation)
• PCR reagents
• Master Mix (e.g., KAPA HiFi HotStart)
• Magnetic beads purification system
• Calibration and control materials
• Pipettes and tips
• Vortex mixer, microcentrifuge, thermal cycler
• Nuclease-free water
• Laboratory plasticware (e.g., tubes, plates, microplates)
• Laboratory Information System (LIS) and data analysis software
1. Safety Precautions:
• Adhere to standard laboratory safety practices, including the use
of personal protective equipment (PPE) (e.g., gloves, lab coat,
safety glasses).
• Dispose of all biological samples and chemical reagents
according to laboratory protocols and local regulations.
• Follow the manufacturer's instructions for the operation and
maintenance of all laboratory equipment.
1. Procedure: A) DNA Extraction:
2. Ensure the sample (e.g., blood, bone marrow) is correctly
labelled and has undergone proper pre-analytical processing.
3. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for the DNA extraction kit
to isolate genomic DNA from the sample.
4. Quantify DNA using a Qubit Fluorometer and assess the quality
using a TapeStation.
B) Library Preparation:
1. Prepare DNA libraries using the library preparation kit following
the manufacturer’s instructions, including fragmentation, end-
repair, A-tailing, adaptor ligation, and PCR amplification.
2. Purify the amplified libraries using magnetic beads and quantify
using Qubit Fluorometer.
3. Assess library quality using TapeStation. Ensure libraries meet
quality thresholds for the subsequent steps.
C) Target Enrichment:
1. Hybridize the prepared libraries with the hereditary
thrombocytopenia gene panel, following the manufacturer's
instructions.
2. Capture the enriched targets, wash, and amplify the target-
enriched libraries.
3. Purify amplified libraries using magnetic beads.
D) Sequencing:
1. Normalize and pool the purified, enriched libraries ready for
sequencing.
2. Perform sequencing on the NGS platform following the
instrument’s standard operating procedures.
3. Monitor sequencing run performance and make real-time
adjustments as needed.
E) Data Analysis:
1. Transfer raw sequencing data to the analysis pipeline, ensuring
data integrity is maintained.
2. Perform initial quality control checks using bioinformatics tools
(e.g., FastQC).
3. Align sequencing reads to the human reference genome (e.g.,
hg19 or hg38) using alignment software (e.g., BWA-MEM).
4. Perform variant calling using variant callers (e.g., GATK,
FreeBayes) and annotate variants with appropriate databases
(e.g., ClinVar, dbSNP).
5. Conduct secondary quality control checks on the called
variants, including depth of coverage and sequencing quality
metrics.
6. Filter, prioritize, and interpret clinically relevant variants in the
context of hereditary thrombocytopenia.
F) Quality Control:
1. Include positive and negative controls in each sequencing run.
2. Ensure the inter-run reproducibility by including replicate
samples.
3. Record all quality control measures and results. Address any
failed controls according to laboratory policy.
4. Merge supplementary control data with primary data for final
interpretation.
G) Reporting:
1. Review and verify identified variants correlating with clinical
data using the LIS.
2. Generate a comprehensive report summarizing findings,
including variant classification (pathogenic, likely pathogenic,
VUS, likely benign, benign) per ACMG guidelines.
3. Include comments on potential clinical significance and
recommendations for follow-up testing if necessary.
4. Record Management:
5. Document all steps rigorously in the laboratory’s information
system.
6. Maintain records of DNA extraction, library preparation, target
enrichment, sequencing runs, data analysis, quality control, and
reporting.
7. Ensure all documentation is securely stored, confidential, and
accessible to authorized personnel only.
8. Troubleshooting:
• Address any equipment malfunctions following manufacturer
guidelines and solve library preparation difficulties. Refer to
quality control fails and variant interpretation challenges.
• Notify the supervisor of any critical issues.

1. Conclusion: By adhering strictly to this SOP, the laboratory
ensures accurate, precise, and reproducible results for the
hereditary thrombocytopenia gene panel using next-generation
sequencing. All personnel must understand, follow, and
document these procedures to maintain the highest quality
standards and reliable diagnostic outcomes.
