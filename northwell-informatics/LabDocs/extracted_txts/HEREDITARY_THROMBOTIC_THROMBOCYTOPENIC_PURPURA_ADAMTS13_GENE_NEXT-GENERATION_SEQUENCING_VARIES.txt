Hereditary Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP),
ADAMTS13 Gene, Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) Protocol
1. PURPOSE: The purpose of this SOP is to define the
procedures for the analytical phase of generating results for
Hereditary Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP)
through the sequencing of the ADAMTS13 gene using next-
generation sequencing (NGS).
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing
and documenting each step of this procedure.
• Supervisors must ensure that all steps are followed accurately
and that any issues are reported and resolved in a timely manner.
1. DEFINITION: Hereditary TTP is a rare, genetic blood disorder
characterized by recurrent episodes of microvascular
thrombosis often due to mutations in the ADAMTS13 gene.
Reduced activity of the ADAMTS13 enzyme results in unusually
large von Willebrand factor multimers in the blood, leading to
small-vessel clots, low platelet counts, and hemolytic anemia.
2. PROCEDURE:
Equipment and Reagents:
• NGS platform (e.g., Illumina, Ion Torrent)
• DNA extraction kit
• Library preparation kit
• PCR reagents and equipment
• Clean laboratory areas for pre- and post-PCR processes
• Computer with bioinformatics software for NGS data analysis
Specimen:
• Peripheral blood or saliva sample collected and processed to
extract DNA.
A) DNA Extraction:
1. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions of the DNA extraction kit
to isolate genomic DNA from the sample.
2. Measure DNA concentration and purity using a
spectrophotometer.
3. Document the DNA concentration and purity in the laboratory
information system (LIS).
B) Library Preparation:
1. Quantify 100 ng of high-quality genomic DNA for library
preparation.
2. Fragment DNA to the desired size range specific for the NGS
platform used.
3. Perform end-repair, dA-tailing, and adapter ligation steps as per
the library preparation kit instructions.
4. Amplify the library using PCR, ensuring conditions and cycles
are optimized for the ADAMTS13 gene.
5. Purify PCR products and evaluate the library size distribution
using a Bioanalyzer or Fragment Analyzer.
6. Document each step and results of library preparation in the
LIS.
C) Sequencing:
1. Load the prepared and quantified library onto the NGS platform
following the manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Set up the sequencing run ensuring that parameters are
optimized for sequencing of the ADAMTS13 gene.
3. Monitor sequencing run and ensure the run completes without
interruption. If the run fails, document and troubleshoot as per
the manufacturer's guidelines.
D) Data Analysis:
1. Transfer raw sequencing data to the bioinformatics pipeline for
analysis.
2. Perform quality control checks on the sequencing data.
3. Align sequencing reads to the reference human genome
(GRCh38 or latest).
4. Identify variants in the ADAMTS13 gene using appropriate
variant calling software.
5. Annotate identified variants to predict their effect and clinical
significance.
6. Validate identified variants using Sanger sequencing or another
orthogonal method, if required.
E) Reporting:
1. Review and interpret the variant data in the context of the
patient’s clinical presentation.
2. Generate a comprehensive report, including a description and
clinical significance of the identified variants.
3. Document the results in the LIS and prepare the report for the
requesting clinician.
4. Ensure that all critical and actionable results are promptly
communicated to the requesting physician.
F) Quality Control:
1. Include positive and negative controls and ensure expected
results are obtained.
2. Perform periodic proficiency testing and equipment calibration.
3. Maintain records of all control results, calibrations, and any
deviations from standard procedure.
4. QUALITY ASSURANCE:
• Results should be verified and reviewed by a qualified laboratory
supervisor before releasing them.
• All instruments should be maintained and calibrated regularly.
• Periodic review of procedures and updating protocols to reflect
the latest best practices.
1. REFERENCES:
• Manufacturer’s instructions for DNA extraction, library preparation,
and sequencing platforms.
• Bioinformatics software user manuals.
• Latest clinical guidelines for the interpretation of ADAMTS13
genetic variants.
1. NOTES:
• Proper biosafety and contamination control measures should be
followed at all times.
• Ensure all documentation is legible and adequately archived.
By adhering to this SOP, results generated for Hereditary TTP
through NGS of the ADAMTS13 gene will be standardized, accurate,
and clinically relevant.
