Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase Protocol for Generating Results for
Hereditary Thyroid Cancer Panel
1. Purpose:
To provide standardized procedures for the analysis of genetic data
for the Hereditary Thyroid Cancer Panel, ensuring consistent,
accurate, and reliable results.
2. Scope:
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel conducting the
analysis of Hereditary Thyroid Cancer Panel on collected and
accessioned samples.
3. Responsibility:
• Laboratory Technologists: Responsible for the execution of the
procedures detailed in this SOP.
• Laboratory Supervisors: Responsible for ensuring adherence to
the SOP and addressing any issues that arise during the
analytical phase.
• Laboratory Directors: Responsible for overall oversight and
ensuring compliance with regulatory standards.
4. Specimens:
Acceptable Specimens:
• Blood samples collected in EDTA tubes.
• Buccal swabs.
• Saliva samples collected in DNA-stabilizing collection kits.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Non-human samples.
• Hemolyzed or degraded samples.
5. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies:
• PCR Thermocycler
• Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) Platform
• Agarose gel electrophoresis apparatus
• Pipettes and sterile pipette tips
• DNA extraction kits
• PCR master mix and reagents
• Sequencing reagents and kits
6. Procedure:
A. DNA Extraction:
1. Verify that the specimen has been accessioned and labeled
correctly.
2. Extract DNA from the specimen using an appropriate DNA
extraction kit following the manufacturer’s instructions.
3. Quantify the extracted DNA using a spectrophotometer or
fluorometer.
4. Record the DNA concentration and purity (A260/A280 ratio).
B. PCR Amplification:
1. Prepare PCR master mix containing the following components:
◦ DNA template
◦ Taq polymerase
◦ dNTP mix
◦ Primers specific for the target genes in the Hereditary
Thyroid Cancer Panel
◦ PCR buffer
◦ Nuclease-free water
2. Set up the PCR reaction in a sterile PCR tube following the
specified cycling conditions.
3. Perform PCR amplification using a thermocycler.
4. Validate PCR product quality and yield using agarose gel
electrophoresis.
C. Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS):
1. Construct sequencing libraries from the PCR products using a
compatible library preparation kit.
2. Quantify and quality-check the prepared libraries using a
Bioanalyzer or similar system.
3. Load the prepared libraries onto the NGS platform following the
manufacturer’s instructions.
4. Execute the sequencing run and monitor the process to ensure
data quality.
D. Data Analysis:
1. Use bioinformatics tools and pipelines to analyze the raw
sequencing data.
2. Perform sequence alignment to the reference genome (e.g.,
hg19/hg38).
3. Identify and annotate variants in the target genes.
4. Perform quality control checks including read depth, coverage,
and variant calling accuracy.
5. Cross-reference identified variants with internal and external
databases to determine clinical relevance.
6. Confirm the presence of pathogenic variants through
orthogonal methods (Sanger sequencing) if necessary.
E. Interpretation and Reporting:
1. Interpret the clinical significance of identified variants based on
current scientific literature and guidelines (e.g., ACMG).
2. Compile a comprehensive report including variant details,
clinical interpretation, and recommendations for patient
management.
3. Review the report for accuracy and completeness.
4. Validate and sign off the report by a qualified Laboratory
Director/Geneticist.
5. Issue the final report to the requesting clinician or healthcare
provider.
7. Quality Control:
• Perform regular maintenance and calibration of equipment as per
manufacturer guidelines.
• Include positive and negative controls in each run to validate
assay performance.
• Document all QC procedures and results.
8. Reporting Results:
• Results are transmitted to the Laboratory Information System
(LIS) and reviewed for accuracy.
• Maintain records of all test results and associated documentation
for compliance and auditing purposes.
9. References:
• Manufacturer’s instruction manuals for equipment and reagents.
• ACMG guidelines for the interpretation of sequence variants.
• Current literature on hereditary thyroid cancer genetics.
10. Revision History:
• Document any revisions to this SOP along with the date and
nature of changes.
