Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Protocol for HEREDITARY WILMS TUMOR PANEL,
VARIES
1. PURPOSE To provide a detailed and standardized procedure
for analyzing and generating results for the Hereditary Wilms
Tumor Panel (HWTP), ensuring accurate and reliable results,
compliance with regulatory standards, and consistency in
testing.
2. SCOPE This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel
involved in the analysis of the Hereditary Wilms Tumor Panel.
The process begins after specimen collection, receipt, and
accessioning, continuing through to the generation and
reporting of results.
3. RESPONSIBILITY All laboratory personnel performing the
HWTP assay are responsible for adhering to this SOP.
Supervisors are responsible for training staff, ensuring
compliance, and addressing any deviations from the protocol.
4. DEFINITIONS Hereditary Wilms Tumor Panel (HWTP): A
genetic testing panel designed to detect mutations linked to
hereditary Wilms Tumor, including aberrations in genes such as
WT1, WTX, and other relevant markers.
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS • Specimen Type: Peripheral
blood (3-5 mL in EDTA tube) or buccal swab. • Transport:
Specimens should be stored and transported at room
temperature. • Stability: Specimens are stable for up to 72
hours at room temperature. If delay is anticipated, refrigeration
at 4°C is acceptable for up to 7 days. Frozen specimens must
not be thawed and refrozen.
6. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES • Thermal cycler
for PCR amplification. • Next-generation sequencing (NGS)
platform. • DNA extraction kit(s) appropriate for the specimen
type. • PCR reagents including Taq polymerase, dNTPs,
primers specific to HWTP. • Sequencing reagents, flow cells,
and buffers compatible with the NGS platform in use. •
Appropriate bioinformatics software for sequence alignment,
variant calling, and interpretation.
7. PROCEDURE A. DNA Extraction:
8. Follow the manufacturer’s protocol for DNA extraction from
peripheral blood or buccal swabs.
9. Quantify and assess the purity of extracted DNA using a
spectrophotometer or fluorometer.
10. Document DNA concentrations and A260/A280 ratios.
B. PCR Amplification:
1. Prepare the PCR reaction mix including primers specific to
HWTP target regions.
2. Set up the thermal cycler with the appropriate PCR program
parameters.
3. Perform PCR amplification and check the product using
agarose gel electrophoresis.
4. Confirm the presence and expected size of PCR products.
C. Library Preparation for NGS:
1. Follow the NGS library preparation kit's protocol specific to the
sequencing platform.
2. Quantify and quality-check the prepared libraries.
D. Next-Generation Sequencing:
1. Load the prepared library onto the NGS sequencing instrument.
2. Configure the run parameters according to the sequencing kit
and platform requirements.
3. Perform sequencing.
E. Data Analysis:
1. Use bioinformatics tools to align sequences to the human
reference genome (e.g., hg19 or GRCh38).
2. Perform variant calling to identify potential mutations in the
HWTP.
3. Annotate and interpret the variants, focusing on pathogenic,
likely pathogenic, uncertain significance, likely benign, and
benign classifications.
4. Confirm significant findings with secondary methods if
necessary.
5. QUALITY CONTROL • Include positive and negative controls in
each PCR and sequencing run. • Periodically participate in
external quality assessment schemes. • Review control results
before reporting patient results. Re-run assays if controls fail.
6. REPORTING RESULTS • Review the raw data, alignment, and
variant calling reports for accuracy. • Generate a
comprehensive report including detected genetic variants, their
clinical significance, and recommendations for clinical
correlation. • Reports must be reviewed and signed-off by a
certified laboratory director or qualified personnel.
7. DOCUMENTATION • Maintain detailed records of DNA
extraction, PCR results, sequencing run parameters, and data
analysis results. • All documentation should be stored according
to laboratory policy and retained for a period compliant with
regulatory and accreditation requirements.
8. REFERENCES • Manufacturer’s manuals and product inserts
for all equipment and reagents used. • Relevant scientific
literature and guidelines for hereditary cancer genetic testing.
9. REVIEW AND APPROVAL This SOP should be reviewed and
approved by the laboratory director and revised annually or as
needed for updates in technology, regulations, or procedures.
