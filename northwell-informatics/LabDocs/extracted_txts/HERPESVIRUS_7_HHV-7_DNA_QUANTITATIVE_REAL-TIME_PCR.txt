Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Quantitative Real-Time
PCR Analysis of Herpesvirus 7 (HHV-7) DNA
1. PURPOSE
This procedure outlines the process for performing quantitative real-
time PCR (qPCR) analysis for the detection and quantification of
Herpesvirus 7 (HHV-7) DNA in clinical specimens.
Responsibility: The molecular laboratory technologist is responsible
for performing the qPCR analysis, interpreting the results, and
ensuring that all documentation is complete and accurate. The
laboratory supervisor is responsible for oversight and troubleshooting
as required.
1. DEFINITION
Quantitative Real-Time PCR (qPCR) is a molecular technology that
allows for the detection and quantification of viral DNA in clinical
specimens through the use of fluorescent probes.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Sample Type:
• Preferred: Whole blood, plasma, or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
• Acceptable: Tissue biopsy in viral transport media
Collection and Storage:
• Collect blood samples in EDTA tubes.
• Plasma and CSF samples should be collected in sterile
containers.
• Transport specimens on ice and store at -20°C or below until
processing.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Samples that are hemolyzed, clotted, or improperly labeled.
• Specimens stored at room temperature for over 24 hours.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Real-Time PCR Instrument (e.g., ABI 7500, Roche LightCycler)
• DNA extraction kit (e.g., QIAamp DNA Mini Kit)
• PCR plates or tubes
• Optical plate seals
• Pipettes and filter tips
• Vortex mixer
• Centrifuge
• HHV-7 qPCR Master Mix
• HHV-7 specific primers and probes
• Positive control (HHV-7 DNA)
• Negative control (Nuclease-free water)
1. PROCEDURE
A) DNA Extraction:
1. Thaw specimen and transfer a defined volume (e.g., 200 µL) to
a clean microcentrifuge tube.
2. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for the DNA extraction kit
to isolate DNA from the specimen.
3. Elute the DNA in an appropriate volume (e.g., 50 µL) of elution
buffer or nuclease-free water.
4. Store extracted DNA at -20°C until PCR analysis.
B) PCR Setup:
1. Thaw the qPCR Master Mix, primers, and probes on ice.
2. Prepare the PCR reaction mix in a clean tube according to the
following volumes per reaction (adjust as needed):
◦ 10 µL qPCR Master Mix
◦ 1 µL HHV-7 specific forward primer
◦ 1 µL HHV-7 specific reverse primer
◦ 1 µL HHV-7 specific probe
◦ 5 µL DNA template
◦ 2 µL Nuclease-free water
3. Mix the reagents gently by pipetting up and down or briefly
vortexing.
4. Dispense the reaction mix into each well of a PCR plate or
tube.
5. Seal the plate with optical seals or cap the tubes.
C) PCR Cycling Conditions:
1. Place the PCR plate or tubes in the Real-Time PCR instrument.
2. Set up the following cycling conditions:
◦ 95°C for 2 minutes (initial denaturation)
◦ 40 cycles of:
▪ 95°C for 15 seconds (denaturation)
▪ 60°C for 1 minute (annealing/extension)
3. Start the PCR run.
D) Data Analysis:
1. Upon completion of the PCR run, examine the amplification
plots for each sample.
2. Determine the cycle threshold (Ct) values for the HHV-7 target
based on the fluorescence signal.
3. Generate a standard curve using the Ct values of the positive
control (serial dilutions) to quantify the viral load in clinical
specimens.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include positive and negative controls in each qPCR run to
ensure the accuracy and validity of the results.
• Check for any contamination or cross-reactivity issues if
unexpected amplification is observed in negative controls.
• Follow the laboratory's standard operating procedures for
instrument maintenance and calibration.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Report results in copies/mL or log copies/mL for clinical
interpretation.
• Record and verify all results in the laboratory information system
(LIS).
• Positive results should include the Ct value and quantity (if
applicable).
• Negative results should be reported as "HHV-7 DNA not
detected."
1. LIMITATIONS
• False negatives may occur if the viral load is below the detection
limit of the assay.
• Inhibitory substances in the sample may affect the efficiency of
the PCR reaction.
• Results should be interpreted in conjunction with clinical and other
laboratory findings.

• Manufacturer’s instructions for the qPCR Master Mix, DNA
extraction kit, and Real-Time PCR instrument.
• Current laboratory quality control and assurance guidelines.
• Relevant peer-reviewed publications on HHV-7 qPCR
methodology.
This SOP is to be reviewed and updated regularly to reflect the latest
advancements and best practices in molecular diagnostics.
