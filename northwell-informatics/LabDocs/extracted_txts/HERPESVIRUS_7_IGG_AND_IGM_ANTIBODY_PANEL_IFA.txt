SOP: Analytical Phase for HERPESVIRUS 7 (HHV-7)
IGG AND IGM ANTIBODY PANEL, IFA
1. PURPOSE
To provide standardized procedures for the detection and
quantification of Herpesvirus 7 (HHV-7) IgG and IgM antibodies using
Indirect Immunofluorescence Assay (IFA).
2. SCOPE
This procedure is applicable to all designated laboratory personnel
performing the HHV-7 IgG and IgM Antibody Panel using IFA.
3. RESPONSIBILITIES
Designated laboratory technicians/technologists are responsible for
executing the procedure following lab protocols. Supervisors are
responsible for training personnel, monitoring performance, and
ensuring adherence to this SOP.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Humidified chamber
• Fluorescence microscope
• Micropipettes and tips
• Vortex mixer
• Centrifuge
• Glass slides pre-coated with HHV-7 antigen
• PBS Wash Buffer (1X)
• IgG and IgM-specific secondary antibodies conjugated to
fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)
• Cover slips
• Mounting medium with antifade agent
• Incubator set to 37°C
• Reagent control sera (positive and negative controls)
5. SPECIMEN
Acceptable Specimens:
• Serum or plasma (collected in EDTA or lithium heparin tubes)
• Ideal volume: Minimum 1 mL
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric specimens
• Specimens collected in anticoagulants other than EDTA or lithium
heparin
6. PROCEDURE
A. PREPARATION
1. Ensure all reagents and samples are at room temperature
before use.
2. Prepare a humidified chamber to prevent slides from drying out
during incubation steps.
3. Prepare all required controls (positive and negative sera).
B. SLIDE PREPARATION
1. Label each slide with the corresponding patient ID and control
identifiers.
2. Add 10 µL of each patient serum and control sera to separate
wells on the HHV-7 antigen-coated slide.
C. PRIMARY ANTIBODY INCUBATION
1. Incubate slides in the humidified chamber at 37°C for 30
minutes.
2. After incubation, wash the slides three times with PBS buffer for
5 minutes each wash to remove unbound antibodies.
D. SECONDARY ANTIBODY INCUBATION
1. Add 10 µL of FITC-conjugated anti-human IgG and IgM to each
well.
2. Incubate slides in the humidified chamber at 37°C for 30
minutes.
3. Wash the slides three times with PBS buffer for 5 minutes each
wash to remove unbound secondary antibody.
E. MOUNTING
1. Add a drop of mounting medium to each well and cover with a
cover slip.
2. Allow the slides to dry for 10 minutes in the dark.
F. MICROSCOPY
1. Examine slides using a fluorescence microscope at 200x
magnification.
2. Evaluate the presence of HHV-7 specific fluorescence in the
cellular cytoplasm and nucleus. A positive result is indicated by
bright green fluorescence.
7. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
• Negative: No fluorescence observed.
• Positive IgG: Fluorescence observed with IgG secondary
antibody.
• Positive IgM: Fluorescence observed with IgM secondary
antibody.
• Dual Positive (IgG and IgM): Fluorescence observed with both
IgG and IgM secondary antibodies.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Record the results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
2. Verify results with appropriate controls.
3. Report findings as per specific reporting guidelines:
◦ IgG: Positive/Negative
◦ IgM: Positive/Negative
9. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include both positive and negative controls in every run.
• Document control results and ensure they fall within established
limits.
• If controls do not meet criteria, repeat the entire assay.
10. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to manufacturer’s instructions for detailed limitations of the IFA
kit. Potential limitations include:
• Non-specific binding leading to false positives
• Specimen handling errors leading to false negatives
