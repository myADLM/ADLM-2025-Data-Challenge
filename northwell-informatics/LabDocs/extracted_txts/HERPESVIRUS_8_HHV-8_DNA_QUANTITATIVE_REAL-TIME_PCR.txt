Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8)
DNA Quantitative Real-Time PCR
1. Purpose
This SOP provides standardized procedures for the quantitative
detection and analysis of Herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) DNA using real-time
polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
1. Responsibility
All trained laboratory personnel involved in molecular diagnostics are
responsible for following this SOP. It is the responsibility of the
laboratory supervisor to ensure staff adhere to these procedures and
identify and address any issues that arise.
1. Definitions
• Real-Time PCR: A technique used to monitor the progress of a
PCR reaction in real time.
• Threshold cycle (Ct): The cycle number at which fluorescence
generated within a reaction crosses the threshold.
• Standard Curves: Used to determine the concentration of target
DNA in quantitative PCR.
• No Template Control (NTC): A control reaction without DNA
template used to detect contamination.
1. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies
• Real-time PCR instrument (e.g., ABI 7500, Bio-Rad CFX96)
• DNA extraction kit (e.g., QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit)
• HHV-8 quantitative PCR assay reagents including:
◦ PCR primers specific for HHV-8
◦ HHV-8 specific probes labeled with a fluorescent reporter dye
and quencher
◦ TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix
◦ Molecular grade water
• HHV-8 DNA standard for generating a standard curve
• Microcentrifuge and tubes
• Pipettes and sterile pipette tips with filters
• 96-well PCR plates or 8-well PCR tube strips and optical adhesive
covers
1. Procedure
A. Sample Preparation
1. Extract DNA from appropriate clinical specimens (e.g., blood,
tissue) using the validated DNA extraction kit.
2. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for the extraction kit.
Ensure to include proper controls during extraction (e.g.,
Positive control, Negative control).
B. Preparation of PCR Master Mix
1. Prepare the PCR master mix on ice in a clean area to prevent
contamination:
◦ TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix
◦ Specific primers (forward and reverse)
◦ Probe (fluorescently labeled)
◦ Molecular grade water
◦ Total volume per reaction (e.g., 20 µL)
2. Prepare sufficient master mix for all reactions including controls:
◦ No Template Control (NTC)
◦ Standard controls (for generating standard curve)
C. PCR Setup
1. Aliquot 18 µL of PCR master mix into each well of a PCR plate
or tube.
2. Add 2 µL of extracted DNA sample to the respective wells for a
final volume of 20 µL.
3. Add 2 µL of standard DNA to the standard curve wells in serial
dilutions.
4. Carefully seal the plate or tubes with optical adhesive covers.
D. Real-Time PCR Cycling Conditions
1. Ensure the real-time PCR instrument is calibrated and prepared
for use.
2. Load the plate/tubes into the real-time PCR instrument.
3. Program the PCR cycling conditions:
◦ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 10 minutes
◦ 40 cycles of:
▪ Denaturation: 95°C for 15 seconds
▪ Annealing and extension: 60°C for 1 minute
E. Data Analysis
1. Upon completion, examine the amplification plots to ensure
proper amplification curves.
2. Quantify the HHV-8 DNA by comparing samples' Ct values to
the standard curve.
3. Ensure all controls (NTC, Positive, Standard) meet acceptance
criteria:
◦ NTC must show no amplification.
◦ Positive control must amplify within expected Ct range.
◦ Standard curve must have an R² value > 0.98 and efficiency
between 90-110%.
F. Reporting Results
1. Generate the quantitative results for HHV-8 DNA in copies/mL
or another standardized unit.
2. Review and verify the results, ensuring sample integrity is
maintained.
3. Report results according to laboratory protocols, documenting
any deviations or issues.
4. Quality Control
• Periodically validate the PCR assay performance with known
standards.
• Regularly perform maintenance checks and re-calibration of the
real-time PCR instrument.
• Document all quality control measures, deviations, and corrective
actions.
