Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Herpes Simplex Virus-1
(HSV-1) Type Specific Antibody, Serum
1. PURPOSE
This protocol outlines the analytical procedures for the detection and
quantification of HSV-1 type-specific antibodies in human serum.
HSV-1 is associated with orofacial infections, and its accurate
detection is critical for appropriate patient management.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
All laboratory personnel performing HSV-1 antibody testing must
follow this protocol to ensure the accuracy and reliability of test
results. It is the responsibility of the laboratory supervisor to ensure
all personnel are trained and competent in this procedure.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type:
• Serum
Collection:
• Collect blood in a red-top or serum separator tube (SST).
• Allow blood to clot by leaving it undisturbed at room temperature
for 30-60 minutes.
• Centrifuge at 1,300-1,800 x g for 10 minutes to separate serum.
Handling and Storage:
• Serum should be separated from cells within 2 hours of collection.
• Store serum at 2-8°C if the test will be performed within 5 days.
• For long-term storage, serum should be aliquoted and stored at
-20°C or lower.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens that are grossly hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric may be
rejected due to potential assay interference.
• Specimens that are not appropriately labeled or have a prolonged
separation time.
4. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Microplate reader capable of reading at 450 nm and 620-630 nm
(reference filter)
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Vortex mixer
Reagents:
• HSV-1 type-specific antibody ELISA kit (store as per
manufacturer's instructions)
• Deionized or distilled water
Supplies:
• ELISA microplates
• Disposable gloves
• Laboratory coat
• Biohazard waste container
5. QUALITY CONTROL
Internal Quality Controls:
• Include positive and negative control sera with each run to
validate assay performance.
• Record lot numbers, expiration dates, and performance data for
all quality control materials.
• Acceptable ranges for quality controls should be established and
followed.
External Quality Controls:
• Participate in proficiency testing programs for HSV-1 type-specific
antibody assays to ensure accuracy and consistency.
6. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Allow all reagents, samples, and controls to reach room
temperature before starting the assay.
2. Mix all reagents gently before use. Do not induce foaming as
bubbles can affect assay performance.
Assay Procedure:
1. Plate Preparation:
◦ Securely fix the desired number of microplate wells in the
frame.
◦ Plan sample and control distribution to include calibrators
and quality controls.
2. Add Samples and Controls:
◦ Add 50 μL of controls and patient sera to the designated
wells.
◦ Add 50 μL of HSV-1 antigen to each well with sera.
3. Incubation:
◦ Cover the plate with adhesive strip and incubate at 37°C for
1 hour.
4. Washing:
◦ Wash each well 5 times with 300 μL of wash buffer. Ensure
complete removal of wash buffer after each wash.
5. Secondary Antibody Addition:
◦ Add 50 μL of enzyme-linked secondary antibody to each
well.
◦ Incubate at room temperature for 30 minutes.
6. Substrate Addition:
◦ Add 50 μL of TMB substrate to each well and incubate for
15 minutes in the dark at room temperature.
7. Stopping Reaction:
◦ Add 50 μL of stop solution to each well. The color should
change from blue to yellow.
8. Reading the Plate:
◦ Read the absorbance at 450 nm with a reference filter of
620-630 nm within 15 minutes of stopping the reaction.
7. RESULTS REPORTING
• Calculate the mean absorbance for each control and specimen.
• Construct a standard curve from the calibrator values.
• Determine the antibody concentration in patient samples from the
standard curve.
• Report the results as positive or negative based on the
established cutoff value.
8. RESULTS INTERPRETATION
• Positive: Indicating the presence of HSV-1 specific antibodies
(IgG) in the serum.
• Negative: No detectable HSV-1 specific antibodies in the
specimen.
• Equivocal: Results falling within a borderline range. Repeat
testing or further investigation may be required.
9. LIMITATIONS
• False positives or negatives may occur due to sample handling or
technical errors.
• Cross-reactivity with other pathogens can occur; clinical
correlation with patient history and other diagnostic information is
required.

11. DOCUMENTATION AND REVIEW
• Document all test runs, control results, and patient results
accurately in the laboratory information system (LIS).
• Review and sign off on daily, weekly, and monthly quality control
records by the designated laboratory supervisor.

type-specific antibody testing in the serum, resulting in reliable and
accurate diagnostic outcomes.
