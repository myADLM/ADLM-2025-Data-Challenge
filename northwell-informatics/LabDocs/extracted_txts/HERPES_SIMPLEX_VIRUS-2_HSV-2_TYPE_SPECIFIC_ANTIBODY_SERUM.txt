1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to ensure accurate and consistent
results for the Herpes Simplex Virus 2 (HSV-2) Type Specific
Antibody testing on serum samples.
Responsibility: It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory
personnel to perform the assay as outlined in this procedure and
ensure all results are accurate and reliable. Any deviations must be
reported to the supervisor.
1. DEFINITION
This test detects HSV-2 type-specific antibodies in human serum and
aids in the diagnosis of HSV-2 infection.
1. SPECIMEN
Preferred/acceptable:
• Serum from a properly collected and processed blood specimen.
Unacceptable:
• Grossly hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric specimens.
• Specimens collected in anticoagulant tubes (e.g., EDTA, heparin).
• Samples not labeled with proper patient identification.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Microplate reader capable of measuring absorbance at a
wavelength of 450 nm.
• Microplate washer
• Pipettes (single and multi-channel)
• Incubator set at 37°C
Reagents:
• HSV-2 Type Specific Antibody ELISA kit
• Deionized water
• Calibration and control sera provided with the kit
Supplies:
• 96-well microplates including breakable wells
• Disposal containers for biohazardous waste
• Absorbent paper towels
1. PROCEDURE
A. Pre-analytical phase
• Ensure all reagents are brought to room temperature before the
assay.
• Verify specimen is properly labeled and has no signs of hemolysis
or other interferences.
• Centrifuge the serum for 10 minutes at 1500 x g (if not already
performed).
B. Analytical phase
1. Prepare a 1:100 dilution of each serum sample, calibrators, and
controls.
◦ Example: Add 5 μL of serum to 495 μL of sample dilution
buffer.
2. Pipette 100 μL of diluted serum, calibrators, and controls into
the assigned wells of the antigen-coated microplate.
3. Incubate the microplate at 37°C for 60 minutes.
4. After incubation, wash the plate thoroughly with the wash buffer
at least five times using a plate washer to ensure proper
cleaning.
5. Add 100 μL of conjugated antibody (provided in the kit) to each
well.
6. Incubate the microplate at 37°C for 30 minutes.
7. Wash the plate as in step 4.
8. Add 100 μL of substrate solution to each well.
9. Incubate the microplate at room temperature for 15 minutes,
protected from light.
10. Stop the reaction by adding 100 μL of stop solution to each
well.
11. Read the absorbance at 450 nm using a microplate reader
within 10 minutes of adding the stop solution.
C. Post-analytical phase
• Calculate the mean absorbance of duplicates for each sample.
• Assess the results based on the manufacturer's instructions and
the provided reference ranges.
• Report results as positive or negative based on the
manufacturer's criteria.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
A. Quality Control Material:
• Use positive and negative controls provided with the ELISA kit.
• Run controls with each batch of tests to ensure the integrity of the
assay.
B. Quality Control Procedure:
• Accept the run if the controls fall within the predefined acceptable
range.
• If controls are out of acceptable range, repeat the assay and
document corrective actions.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Positive: Presence of HSV-2 specific IgG antibodies is detected,
suggesting current or past HSV-2 infection.
• Negative: Absence of HSV-2 specific IgG antibodies is detected,
suggesting no HSV-2 infection or the antibody level is below the
detectable threshold.
Refer to site-specific reporting guidelines for detailed instructions on
result reporting.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• False negatives may occur in the early phase of infection.
• Cross-reaction with other herpes viruses may occur.
