Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Detection of Herpes
Simplex Virus (HSV) by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to provide a standardized method
for the detection of Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) DNA in various
clinical specimens using real-time PCR. This procedure ensures the
reliable, accurate, and timely reporting of results.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the
assay, recording data, and maintaining equipment according to
this procedure.
• Supervisors are responsible for overseeing the process and
handling any troubleshooting or corrective actions required.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Real-time PCR instrument (e.g., ABI 7500 Fast or equivalent)
• Automated DNA extraction system (e.g., Qiagen QIAcube) and
associated reagents
• HSV PCR master mix (commercially available or custom-
prepared)
• PCR-grade water
• Clinical specimens: swabs, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), vesicle
fluid, or tissue samples
• Personal protective equipment (PPE): gloves, lab coat, face
shield
• Micropipettes and filtered tips
• Tube racks
• Microcentrifuge tubes
• Vortex mixer
• Tabletop microcentrifuge
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND HANDLING
A. Acceptable Specimens:
• Vesicle fluid
• Swabs from lesions (ensure proper swabbing technique)
• CSF
• Tissue samples
B. Specimen Stability:
• Store specimens at 2-8°C if processing within 48 hours.
• For longer storage, freeze specimens at -20°C or lower.
C. Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens with no collection date/time indicated
• Specimens that have leaked or are inadequately labeled
1. PROCEDURE
A) DNA Extraction:
1. Perform extraction of DNA from clinical specimens using an
automated DNA extraction system following the manufacturer’s
instructions.
2. Ensure that negative and positive extraction controls are
included in each extraction batch.
3. After extraction, store the isolated DNA at 2-8°C if PCR is to be
performed within the same day. For longer storage, keep the
DNA at -20°C.
B) PCR Setup:
1. Thaw all reagents on ice.
2. Prepare the PCR master mix according to the manufacturer's
instructions or the laboratory's validated protocol.
3. Add the appropriate volume of PCR master mix to each well of
a PCR plate or individual PCR tubes.
4. Add the extracted DNA (5-10 µL) to the wells/tubes containing
the master mix.
◦ Include a no-template control (negative control) and positive
control in each PCR run.
5. Seal the PCR plate/tubes securely to prevent contamination.
C) Real-Time PCR Amplification:
1. Place the sealed PCR plate/tubes into the real-time PCR
instrument.
2. Set up the PCR run parameters according to the validated
protocol for HSV detection.
◦ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 10 minutes
◦ Denaturation: 95°C for 15 seconds
◦ Annealing/Extension: 60°C for 1 minute
◦ Number of cycles: 40
3. Start the PCR run and monitor the amplification in real-time.
D) Result Analysis:
1. Analyze the PCR data after the run is complete using the real-
time PCR instrument software.
2. Confirm the presence of HSV DNA by checking for specific
amplification curves and crossing threshold (Ct) values in the
positive control and clinical specimens.
3. Ensure that the negative control shows no amplification signal.
E) Reporting Results:
1. Record the results including Ct values and interpret them based
on the established laboratory criteria:
◦ Positive: Detection of HSV DNA with a Ct value within the
acceptable range for the assay
◦ Negative: No detection of HSV DNA (no amplification
observed)
◦ Inconclusive: Ambiguous results or failed controls (requires
repeat testing)
2. Enter the results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
for verification and reporting.
3. Critical results (positive for HSV DNA) should be communicated
promptly to the requesting clinician.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
A. Internal Quality Control:
• Include positive and negative controls in each PCR run to ensure
assay accuracy.
• Perform routine calibration and maintenance of the PCR
instrument as per manufacturer guidelines.
B. External Quality Control:
• Participate in an external proficiency testing program for HSV
DNA detection to ensure ongoing assay performance.
