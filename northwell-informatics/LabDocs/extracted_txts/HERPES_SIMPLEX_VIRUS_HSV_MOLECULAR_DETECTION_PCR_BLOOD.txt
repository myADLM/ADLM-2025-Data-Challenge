Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
HSV Molecular Detection, PCR, Blood
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the detection of
Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) in blood specimens through
Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) methodology to ensure
consistent, accurate, and timely reporting of results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
Qualified laboratory personnel are responsible for performing
the PCR testing for HSV, ensuring quality control, documenting
results accurately, and reporting any abnormalities to the
supervisor.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
◦ Preferred specimen: Whole blood collected in EDTA
(lavender top) tube.
◦ Volume: Minimum of 1mL whole blood.
◦ Stability:
▪ Room temperature (18-25°C): 24 hours
▪ Refrigerated (2-8°C): 72 hours
▪ Frozen (-20°C or colder): 1 month
4. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
◦ PCR thermocycler
◦ HSV PCR Master Mix (containing HSV-specific primers and
probe)
◦ Nuclease-free water
◦ Positive and negative control samples
◦ DNA extraction kit
◦ Micropipettes and sterile tips
◦ Microcentrifuge tubes
◦ Vortex mixer
◦ Centrifuge
◦ Biosafety cabinet
5. PROCEDURE
A) Specimen Preparation
1. Receive and log the specimen ensuring accurate patient
identification.
2. Process blood specimens by performing a DNA extraction
using a validated DNA extraction kit according to
manufacturer instructions.
3. Quantitate DNA concentration using a spectrophotometer
or fluorometer and dilute to the required concentration for
PCR analysis.
B) PCR Setup
1. Prepare PCR Master Mix as follows:
▪ HSV PCR Master Mix: 15µL
▪ DNA template: 5µL (sample or control)
▪ Total volume per reaction: 20µL
2. Aliquot the master mix into PCR tubes, adding the DNA
template or controls to the designated tubes.
3. Include appropriate positive and negative controls in each
run.
4. Cap tubes and vortex briefly to mix, then centrifuge briefly
to bring all contents to the bottom of the tubes.
C) Amplification
1. Place the prepared reaction tubes into the PCR
thermocycler.
2. Set the thermocycler program for HSV PCR as follows:
▪ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 10 minutes
▪ 40 cycles:
▪ Denaturation: 95°C for 15 seconds
▪ Annealing/Extension: 60°C for 1 minute
3. Ensure that fluorescence data is collected at the end of
each annealing/extension step.
D) Post-PCR Analysis
1. Once amplification is complete, analyze the data using
the thermocycler's software.
2. Verify that the positive control has amplified and the
negative control shows no amplification. Any deviation
must be documented, and results considered invalid
without appropriate control outcomes.
3. Determine the presence/absence of HSV DNA in patient
samples by analyzing the amplification plots and
threshold cycle (Ct) values.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Run positive and negative controls with each batch of
specimens to ensure the accuracy and efficiency of the PCR
run.
◦ Regularly verify the performance of thermocyclers and other
equipment as per the maintenance schedule.
◦ Document all control outcomes and any necessary
corrective actions taken.
7. RESULT REPORTING
◦ Positive for HSV: Samples with Ct values within the
acceptable range and a corresponding amplification plot
matching the positive control.
◦ Negative for HSV: Samples showing no amplification or Ct
values beyond the acceptable threshold corresponding to
the negative control.
8. REFERENCE INTERVALS
◦ Positive: Ct value <35 (or as validated for the assay)
◦ Negative: Ct value ≥35 or no Ct value
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
◦ Sensitivity and specificity are highly dependent on specimen
quality and storage.
◦ False negatives can occur due to insufficient viral DNA or
presence of PCR inhibitors in the sample.
◦ False positives can occur due to cross-contamination during
sample preparation.
