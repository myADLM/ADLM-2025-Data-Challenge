Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Analytical Phase: HSV Molecular Detection, PCR, Spinal Fluid
1. PURPOSE
To detect the presence of Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) 1 and 2 DNA
in spinal fluid using the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) method.
This test is essential for the diagnostic confirmation of HSV infections
in the central nervous system.
2. SCOPE
This protocol applies to all laboratory personnel responsible for
conducting molecular detection of HSV in spinal fluid using PCR
technology.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory personnel to
perform and document all steps in the HSV PCR testing procedure,
ensure quality control procedures are followed, and conduct
necessary troubleshooting. Supervisors must ensure adherence to
this SOP.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND HANDLING
Specimen Type:
• Spinal Fluid (CSF)
Volume:
• Minimum 0.5 mL
Storage:
• Specimens should be kept at 2-8°C and tested within 24 hours. If
a delay is expected, freeze the specimen at -20°C or below.
Unacceptable Conditions:
• Specimens with insufficient volume, visibly contaminated, or not
properly labeled with patient information.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
a) Equipment:
• PCR Thermocycler
• Microcentrifuge
• Pipette sets (2-20 µL, 20-200 µL, 100-1000 µL)
• Vortex mixer
• PCR workstation
b) Reagents and Supplies:
• HSV DNA Extraction Kit
• PCR Master Mix
• Positive Control HSV DNA
• Negative Control (nuclease-free water)
• PCR tubes and caps
• Disposable gloves, lab coat, safety goggles
6. PROCEDURE
Sample Preparation:
1. Thaw frozen CSF specimens if necessary and allow them to
reach room temperature.
2. Vortex the sample briefly to ensure homogeneity.
3. Aliquot 0.5 mL of the CSF specimen into a sterile
microcentrifuge tube.
DNA Extraction:
1. Perform DNA extraction using the HSV DNA Extraction Kit
according to the manufacturer's instructions.
2. Label tubes correctly to avoid mix-ups.
3. Elute the extracted DNA in a final volume of 50 µL of the elution
buffer provided in the kit.
4. Store the extracted DNA at 2-8°C if PCR is not performed
immediately.
PCR Setup:
1. Preheat the thermocycler to the initial denaturation temperature
as specified by the PCR Master Mix provider.
2. Prepare the PCR Master Mix according to the manufacturer's
instructions and include the following components per reaction:
◦ PCR Master Mix (contains Taq polymerase, dNTPs, MgCl2):
12.5 µL
◦ Forward Primer (20 µM): 0.5 µL
◦ Reverse Primer (20 µM): 0.5 µL
◦ Extracted DNA template: 5.0 µL
◦ Nuclease-free water: 6.5 µL (adjust to a final volume of 25
µL)
3. Include a positive control (HSV DNA) and a negative control
(nuclease-free water) in each PCR run to validate the results.
Thermocycling Conditions:
1. Place the PCR tubes in the thermocycler and set the following
cycling conditions:
◦ Initial Denaturation: 95°C for 5 minutes
◦ Denaturation: 95°C for 30 seconds
◦ Annealing: 55°C for 30 seconds
◦ Extension: 72°C for 1 minute
◦ Final Extension: 72°C for 7 minutes
◦ Hold at 4°C
Number of cycles: 40
Gel Electrophoresis and Detection: (Optional based on specific
laboratory setup, if real-time PCR is not used)
1. Prepare a 1.5% agarose gel in 1x TBE buffer.
2. Load 10 µL of PCR product mixed with loading dye into each
well.
3. Include appropriate DNA ladders to determine the size of the
PCR products.
4. Run the gel at 100 volts for approximately 30 minutes or until
separation is sufficient.
5. Visualize the bands under UV light.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Ensure that both the positive control and negative control produce
appropriate results:
◦ Positive control should show a clear band of expected size
(approximately 200-300 bp for HSV PCR).
◦ Negative control should show no bands.
• Run internal and external quality controls according to site-
specific guidelines.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Positive results should be reported if a clear band corresponding
to the HSV target region (approximately 200-300 bp) is seen in
the patient sample lane.
• Negative results should be reported if no HSV-specific band is
observed.
• Any inconclusive results should prompt a re-extraction and
repetition of the PCR process.
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Poor sample quality or degradation can lead to false-negative
results.
• Contamination can lead to false-positive results. Strict adherence
to contamination control procedures is necessary.
• Variability in thermocycler conditions or reagent quality can affect
PCR efficiency.

11. REVIEW AND REVISION
This SOP will be reviewed annually, and revisions will be made as
necessary based on new guidelines, techniques, or equipment
updates. The next review date is scheduled for October 2024.
