Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Herpes Simplex Virus
(HSV) Molecular Detection by PCR
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to provide standardized instructions
for the molecular detection of Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) using
Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) in clinical specimens. This
ensures consistent and accurate results.
1. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all qualified laboratory personnel trained in
molecular diagnostics and PCR techniques.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
All laboratory personnel performing HSV PCR testing must follow this
SOP. It is the responsibility of the laboratory supervisor to ensure all
personnel are adequately trained and competent in the procedures
described.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred Specimens:
• Swabs of lesions (viral transport medium)
• Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
• Oropharyngeal samples
• Genital swabs
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens not collected in viral transport medium
• Specimens at inappropriate temperature on arrival
• Specimens without proper labeling or collection date/time
Specimen Handling:
• Specimens must be maintained at 2-8°C and processed within 24
hours of collection for optimal results.
• If processing is delayed, specimens can be stored at -70°C for
longer-term preservation.
1. REQUIRED MATERIALS
Equipment:
• PCR thermocycler
• Centrifuge
• Biosafety cabinet type II
Reagents and Supplies:
• Viral DNA extraction kits
• HSV PCR master mix (primers and probes included)
• Nuclease-free water
• PCR tubes or plates
• Pipettes and sterile filtered pipette tips
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
1. REAGENT PREPARATION
• Prepare PCR master mix following the manufacturer’s
instructions. Include components such as polymerase, dNTPs,
buffer, primers, and probes specific for HSV DNA.
• Aliquot reagents to avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
• Prepare positive and negative control samples. Positive control
contains known HSV DNA, and negative control contains
nuclease-free water.
1. PROCEDURE
Viral DNA Extraction:
• Follow the viral DNA extraction kit protocol to extract DNA from
the clinical specimen.
• Quantify and assess the quality of DNA using a
spectrophotometer if applicable.
PCR Set-Up:
• Label PCR tubes or plates accordingly.
• In a PCR clean zone, add the following to each PCR tube or well:
◦ 18 µL of HSV PCR master mix
◦ 2 µL of extracted DNA (patient sample or control)
• Ensure proper mixing without introducing bubbles.
• Seal the PCR tubes or plates carefully.
PCR Amplification:
• Load the tubes/plate into the PCR thermocycler.
• Set the PCR program as follows:
◦ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 10 minutes
◦ 40 cycles of:
▪ Denaturation: 95°C for 15 seconds
▪ Annealing/Extension: 60°C for 1 minute
Amplification Detection:
• Fluorescent signal detection should be programmed according to
the thermocycler manufacturer’s instructions.
• At the end of the run, collect amplification data.
1. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
• Analyze the amplification plot to determine the presence of HSV
DNA. Positive results will show a clear exponential amplification
curve.
• Positive Control: Should show a clear amplification curve.
• Negative Control: Should show no amplification signal. If there is
amplification, the run is invalid, indicating contamination.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include positive and negative controls in each run.
• Ensure all instruments are calibrated and maintained according to
the manufacturers’ protocols.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Valid results should be documented and reviewed by a qualified
technologist.
• Results will be entered into the LIS (Laboratory Information
System) for documentation and must be verified by the
technologist.
1. SAFETY
• Follow all biosafety guidelines for handling clinical specimens and
chemicals.
• Use appropriate PPE, including gloves, lab coats, and face
protection, when necessary.
• Dispose of all biohazard waste according to laboratory safety
protocols.
