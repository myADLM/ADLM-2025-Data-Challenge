Title: Protocol for the Analytical Phase of Generating Results for
Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) Type 1- and Type 2-Specific Antibodies,
IgG, Serum
1. PURPOSE
To establish a standardized procedure for the detection of Herpes
Simplex Virus (HSV) Type 1- and Type 2-Specific Antibodies, IgG in
serum using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
Responsibility: The designated medical laboratory scientists (MLS)
and technicians are responsible for performing the assay and
documenting results.
1. PRINCIPLE
The ELISA method is employed to qualitatively detect HSV-1 and
HSV-2 IgG antibodies in human serum. Serum specimens are added
to wells pre-coated with HSV-1 or HSV-2 antigens. If present, specific
antibodies bind to the antigens. After washing to remove unbound
substances, an enzyme-labelled secondary antibody is added, which
binds to human IgG. A substrate is then added, which, in the
presence of the enzyme, produces a color change. The intensity of
the color is proportional to the amount of HSV-specific IgG antibodies
in the sample.
1. SPECIMEN
A) Collection and Handling: i. Preferred: Serum collected in a red-top
tube or serum separator tube (SST). ii. Collect at least 1 mL of
serum. Do not use hemolyzed, contaminated, or highly lipemic
samples, as these may interfere with test results. iii. Serum should be
separated from the clot within 2 hours of collection. iv. Store serum
specimens at 2-8°C if testing within 48 hours, or freeze at -20°C for
long-term storage.
B) Unacceptable Specimens: i. Specimens with gross hemolysis,
contamination, or excessive lipemia. ii. Specimens not meeting
collection or handling criteria.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
A) Equipment: i. ELISA Reader (capable of measuring absorbance at
450 nm and reference at 620-630 nm) ii. Micropipettes and tips iii.
Multichannel pipette (optional) iv. Wash bottle or automated plate
washer
B) Reagents: i. ELISA HSV-1 & HSV-2 IgG Test Kit (follow
manufacturer's specific instructions) ii. Wash buffer, substrate
solution (TMB), and stop solution iii. Control sera (positive and
negative) iv. Calibration standards (if required by the test kit)
C) Supplies: i. Microtiter plates pre-coated with HSV-1 and HSV-2
antigens ii. Disposable pipette tips iii. Absorbent pads iv. Laboratory
timer v. Microcentrifuge tubes (if needed for aliquots)
1. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation: i. Bring all reagents and samples to room
temperature (18-25°C) before use. ii. Prepare wash solution
according to kit instructions. iii. Ensure all equipment is calibrated
and functioning properly.
B) Assay Procedure: i. Add 100 µL of diluted serum samples,
controls, and calibrators to the designated wells of the microtiter
plate. ii. Incubate the plate at 37°C for 30 minutes. iii. Wash the plate
5 times with wash buffer, ensuring all wells are filled completely and
emptied completely after each wash step. iv. Add 100 µL of enzyme-
conjugate solution to each well. v. Incubate at 37°C for 30 minutes.
vi. Wash the plate as described in step iii. vii. Add 100 µL of substrate
solution to each well. viii. Incubate at room temperature (18-25°C) in
the dark for 10-15 minutes. ix. Add 50 µL stop solution to each well to
halt the reaction. x. Measure the absorbance of each well at 450 nm
with a reference wavelength of 620-630 nm.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
A) Internal Quality Control: i. Include positive and negative controls in
each run. ii. Results for controls must fall within the manufacturer’s
specified range for the run to be valid. iii. Maintain records of control
results for trend analysis.
B) External Quality Control: i. Participate in proficiency testing
programs as available. ii. If quality control fails, do not report patient
results. Investigate and resolve the issue before retesting.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
A) Calculations: i. Calculate mean absorbance values for controls
and patient samples. ii. Determine the cutoff value according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. iii. Compare sample absorbance to the
cutoff: - Positive: Absorbance ≥ Cutoff - Negative: Absorbance <
Cutoff
B) Interpretation: Refer to the test kit insert for detailed interpretation
guidelines. Common interpretations: i. Positive: Presence of HSV-1/
HSV-2 IgG antibodies, indicating past or present infection. ii.
Negative: Absence of HSV-1/HSV-2 IgG antibodies, indicating no
previous exposure or insufficient antibody levels.
C) Documentation: i. Record test results in the Laboratory
Information System (LIS). ii. Verify and review results before release.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the manufacturer's test kit insert for specific limitations.
Common limitations include: i. Cross-reactivity with other
herpesviruses. ii. Potential interference from high levels of
rheumatoid factor (RF) or heterophile antibodies. iii. False-negative
results may occur in early stages of infection and
immunocompromised patients.

1. DOCUMENTATION
Ensure all steps are documented accurately including the test run,
calibration curves, control results, and patient results. Proper logs
should be maintained for troubleshooting purposes.
