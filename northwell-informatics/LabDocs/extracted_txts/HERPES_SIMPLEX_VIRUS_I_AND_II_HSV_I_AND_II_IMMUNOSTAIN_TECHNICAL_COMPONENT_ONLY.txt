Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for HSV I and II Immunostain
Protocol - Technical Component Only
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to provide standardized procedures for
the technical component of Herpes Simplex Virus I and II (HSV I and
II) Immunostain assays in order to ensure reliable and reproducible
results that meet clinical and laboratory standards. This SOP does
not cover specimen collection, receipt, or accessioning. It covers
steps starting from the preparation of reagents to the generation and
reporting of technical results.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing HSV
I and II Immunostain assays as described in this SOP. All laboratory
personnel are responsible for following these procedures accurately
and documenting any deviations or issues encountered during the
process.
1. DEFINITION
HSV I and II Immunostain: A diagnostic technique using antibodies to
detect Herpes Simplex Virus types I and II in tissue samples by
immunohistochemistry.
1. PROCEDURE
3.1 Reagents and Supplies
• HSV I and II Immunostain kit (includes primary antibodies,
secondary antibodies, chromogen substrate, and any required
buffers).
• Positive and negative control slides.
• Tissue samples (previously collected and prepared for staining).
• Microscope slides (silane-coated recommended).
• Microtome and associated cutting tools.
• Hot plate or oven.
• Staining racks.
• Coplin jars.
• Wash buffer.
• Mounting medium.
• Coverslips.
• Gloves, lab coat, and other PPE.
3.2 Preparation of Reagents Ensure all reagents are stored as per
the manufacturer’s instructions and are within their expiration date.
Prepare working solutions of reagents as indicated in the kit insert.
3.3 Pre-treatment of Slides
1. Retrieve pre-cut formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE)
tissue sections.
2. Heat tissue sections on slides using a hot plate or oven at 60°C
for 30 minutes to ensure secure adhesion.
3. Deparaffinize sections in xylene and rehydrate through a series
of alcohols (100%, 95%, 70%) to water.
4. Perform antigen retrieval as specified in the HSV I and II
Immunostain kit insert (e.g., using heat-induced epitope
retrieval in citrate buffer).
3.4 Immunostaining Procedure
1. Apply the blocking solution specified in the kit to prevent non-
specific binding. Incubate for the recommended duration.
2. Apply primary HSV I antibody to one set of slides and HSV II
antibody to another set of slides. Incubate as per kit
instructions.
3. Wash slides in the appropriate wash buffer.
4. Apply secondary antibody. Incubate for the specified time.
5. Wash slides again in the appropriate wash buffer.
6. Apply chromogen substrate. Monitor the development of color,
usually within 3-10 minutes.
7. Counterstain slides, if desired, with hematoxylin.
8. Wash slides in distilled water.
9. Dehydrate slides through graded alcohol series to xylene.
10. Apply mounting medium and coverslip.
3.5 Quality Control
1. Run positive and negative control slides with each batch of
patient samples.
2. Document any deviations from the protocol or issues
encountered.
3. Review and verify the control results and ensure the staining
quality meets laboratory standards before reporting patient
sample results.
3.6 Reporting Results
1. Generate technical results based on staining patterns
observed.
2. Record and document results, including control slide outcomes.
3. Forward slides and documented technical results to the
pathologist for interpretation.
References: Refer to the HSV I and II Immunostain kit product insert
and relevant literature for specific reagent preparation and
procedures.
Compliance Verification: Periodic audits and reviews will be
conducted to ensure compliance with this SOP. Any updates or
revisions to the SOP will be communicated to all laboratory
personnel.
Documentation: Record all pertinent information, including reagent lot
numbers, incubation times, results of positive and negative controls,
and any deviations from the standard protocol in the laboratory
information system (LIS). Maintain records for auditing purposes.
Note: This SOP covers the technical component only. Interpretation
of the stained slides should be performed by a qualified pathologist
following the technical procedures outlined above.
