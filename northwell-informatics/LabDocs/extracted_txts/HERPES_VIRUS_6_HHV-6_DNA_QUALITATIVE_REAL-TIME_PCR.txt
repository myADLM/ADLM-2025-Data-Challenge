STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP) Real-Time PCR for
Herpes Virus 6 (HHV-6) DNA, Qualitative
1. PURPOSE To detect and qualitatively analyze the presence of
Herpes Virus 6 (HHV-6) DNA in clinical specimens using real-
time PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) technology.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred Specimen Types:
• Blood: EDTA or heparinized blood collected using standard
phlebotomy techniques.
• CSF: Sterile collection into a screw-capped tube.
• Tissue: Aseptically collected tissue placed in sterile containers or
snap-frozen.
• Saliva: Sterile collection into sealed containers.
• Other body fluids: Collected as per standard aseptic techniques.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens with evidence of microbial contamination.
• Specimens that have been improperly stored or transported.
• Specimens lacking proper labeling or collection date/time.
• Specimens received in leaking or broken containers.
Storage and Stability:
• Specimens can be stored at 2-8°C for up to 24 hours.
• For longer storage, specimens should be frozen at -20°C or lower.

1. PROCEDURE
A. DNA Extraction:
1. Perform DNA extraction using the validated DNA extraction kit
as per manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Ensure the amount and purity of DNA are adequate and store
extracted DNA at 2-8°C (short-term) or -20°C (long-term) until
PCR setup.
B. Real-Time PCR Setup:
1. Thaw all reagents on ice and vortex briefly before use.
2. Prepare a PCR reaction mix as per the following guidelines:
◦ PCR master mix: Check manufacturer’s instructions for
volume.
◦ Herpes Virus 6 (HHV-6) DNA primer/probe mix: Adjust
according to manufacturer-specific volumes.
◦ Extracted DNA template: Add suitable volume and adjust for
total reaction volume.
◦ Nuclease-free water: Complete the total reaction volume.
3. Aliquot the PCR reaction mix into individual PCR tubes.
4. Set up positive controls, negative controls (nuclease-free
water), and no-template controls.
5. Cap the PCR tubes and briefly centrifuge to settle mix
components.
C. PCR Cycling Conditions:
1. Set the real-time PCR thermal cycler according to the following
cycling conditions:
◦ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 5 minutes.
◦ Amplification cycles (40 cycles): Denaturation: 95°C for 15
seconds. Annealing/Extension: 60°C for 1 minute.
2. Program the cycler to collect fluorescence data during the
extension phase.
D. Data Analysis:
1. After PCR is complete, analyze the collected data to determine
the presence or absence of HHV-6 DNA.
2. Positive controls must show amplification curves, and negative
controls should show no amplification.
3. Review and interpret Ct (threshold cycle) values to conclude
the qualitative presence of HHV-6 DNA.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
Internal Controls:
• Process positive controls, negative controls, and no-template
controls in each PCR run.
• Positive control amplification must conform to expected Ct values.
• Negative control must show no amplification.
External Controls:
• Regularly use standardized external controls to confirm assay
performance.
• Perform periodic proficiency testing and inter-laboratory
comparisons.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
Verification: Review amplification curves and Ct values. Ensure
control samples conform to expected results.
Documentation: Record results in Laboratory Information System
(LIS) and validate as per site-specific guidelines.
Reporting:
• Positive: "HHV-6 DNA detected."
• Negative: "HHV-6 DNA not detected."
Refer to site-specific reporting guidelines for special circumstances or
ambiguous results. Utilize established templates for reporting results
consistently.
