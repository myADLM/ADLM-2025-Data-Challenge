Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Generating
Results for HERRING, IGE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the standardized procedure for
analyzing and generating results for Immunoglobulin E (IgE) in serum
samples. This protocol ensures accuracy, reliability, and efficiency in
reporting IgE levels.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory staff are responsible for the analysis, result
generation, and documentation of IgE levels in serum samples.
• It is the responsibility of all laboratory staff to adhere to this
procedure and report any anomalies or issues to the supervising
laboratory technologist.
1. DEFINITION
• HERRING, IGE, SERUM: This refers to the analysis of serum IgE
levels, which are used to assess allergic reactions and
immunological responses.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred Specimen:
◦ Serum obtained from a venous blood sample collected in a
serum separator tube (SST) or plain red-top tube.
◦ Volume: Minimum 1 mL of serum required.
◦ The sample should be free of hemolysis and visible
particulates.
◦ Store and transport the sample at 2-8°C. If analysis is not
performed immediately, the serum can be frozen at -20°C for
longer-term storage.
• Unacceptable Specimen:
◦ Samples with significant hemolysis or lipemia.
◦ Specimens collected in inappropriate tubes or anticoagulants.
◦ Clotted or insufficient specimens.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Automated Immunoassay Analyzer (e.g., Roche Cobas, Siemens
Immulite, etc.)
• Specific IgE assay reagents and calibrators.
• Quality Control (QC) materials (bi-level controls).
• Serum separator tubes (SST) or plain red-top tubes.
• Pipettes and pipette tips.
• Sample cups or racks compatible with the analyzer.
1. PROCEDURE
• Preparation:
1. Ensure all equipment and reagents are calibrated and within
their expiration dates.
2. Check that the analyzer is properly maintained and perform
a QC check prior to sample analysis.
• Sample Processing:
1. Centrifuge the collected blood sample at 1500-2000 x g for
10-15 minutes to obtain serum.
2. Aliquot the serum into a clean, appropriately labeled tube.
3. If the sample has been stored frozen, thaw at room
temperature and mix gently by inversion.
• Assay Procedure:
1. Load the samples into the analyzer as per the
manufacturer's instructions.
2. Follow the assay-specific protocol for IgE measurement
provided by the reagent manufacturer.
3. Run calibrators and QC samples according to the
manufacturer’s guidelines.
4. Document QC results. QC results must fall within the
accepted range; if they do not, identify and rectify any
issues before proceeding with patient samples.
• Result Generation:
1. After the analysis is complete, review the generated results
for accuracy.
2. If any results fall outside of the expected range or indicate
potential errors, repeat the analysis or perform additional
QC checks.
3. If discrepancies persist, refer to the on-call supervisor or
manager for further guidance.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run bi-level QC samples at the beginning of each shift and with
every new batch of reagents.
• Ensure all QC results are documented and maintained for record-
keeping.
• If QC results fall outside the acceptable range, troubleshoot
according to the analyzer’s troubleshooting guide and repeat the
QC tests until acceptable results are obtained.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results are automatically transmitted to the Laboratory
Information System (LIS) and must be reviewed and validated by
the technologist before release.
• Report IgE levels in IU/mL, referencing the assay’s calibration
curve.
• Note any sample integrity issues and include appropriate
comments in the LIS.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Reference intervals for IgE levels should be documented and
referenced according to the specific assay and patient population.
Typically:
◦ Normal range: 0 - 100 IU/mL (may vary based on age and
assay)
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to the specific assay insert for limitations, such as potential
interfering substances, assay sensitivity, and specificity.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING
• Refer to the analyzer and reagent package insert for detailed
troubleshooting steps.
• Document any deviations and corrective actions taken during the
analysis process.
1. REFERENCES
• Assay reagent package insert.
• Analyzer user manual.
• Laboratory internal QC and SOP manuals.
This SOP is effective from [Effective Date] and will be reviewed
and updated annually or as needed.
