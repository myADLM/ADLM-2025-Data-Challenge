STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP)
Title: Protocol for the Analytical Phase: Generating Results for
Heterophile Antibody (Monospot), Serum
Purpose: To ensure accurate and reliable testing and reporting of
heterophile antibodies in serum specimens using the Monospot test.
Scope: This procedure applies to all laboratory staff responsible for
performing and reporting Monospot tests on serum specimens.
Responsibility: It is the responsibility of trained laboratory personnel
to perform the Monospot test following the procedure outlined below
and to report results accurately.
Materials and Equipment Required:
• Monospot test kit (includes all necessary reagents and test
materials)
• Test tubes or suitable containers
• Micropipettes and tips
• Serum specimens
• Timer
• Disposable gloves
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
• Laboratory refrigerator
Procedure:
1. Specimen Requirements and Preparation:
◦ Preferred/acceptable: Serum collected in SST (Serum
Separator Tube), transferred into a clean test tube after
centrifugation, and stored at 2-8°C until testing.
◦ Ensure specimens are free from hemolysis, lipemia, and
gross contamination.
◦ Specimens must be processed promptly; ideally within 48
hours of collection or refrigerated at 2-8°C if longer storage
is required.
◦ Bring refrigerated specimens to room temperature prior to
analysis.
2. Reagents and Kit Preparation:
◦ Check the expiration date of the Monospot test kit and
ensure it is within the valid range.
◦ Allow reagents and test materials to reach room
temperature before use.
◦ Follow the manufacturer's instructions for the preparation of
reagents.
3. Performing the Test:
◦ Step 1: Label all test tubes with the appropriate patient
identifiers.
◦ Step 2: Pipette the required volume of patient serum into
the test tube as indicated by the manufacturer's protocol.
◦ Step 3: Add the required reagents to the serum following
the order and instructions specified in the kit insert.
◦ Step 4: Mix the contents gently and set the timer for the
incubation period as specified by the manufacturer's
instructions (usually around 2-5 minutes).
◦ Step 5: Observe the reaction in the test tube. The presence
of agglutination indicates a positive result, while the
absence of agglutination indicates a negative result.
◦ Step 6: Record the results promptly in the laboratory
information system (LIS) and document the date, time, and
initials of the technologist performing the test.
4. Quality Control:
◦ Perform quality control tests with each batch of Monospot
tests using control sera (positive and negative controls) as
specified in the kit insert.
◦ Record quality control results and ensure reagents and
procedures are functioning as expected before reporting
patient results.
◦ Any discrepancies or failures in quality control must be
addressed before proceeding with patient testing.
5. Reporting Results:
◦ Results are recorded in the LIS.
◦ Interpret results as follows: Positive: Agglutination
observed; indicative of heterophile antibodies presence.
Negative: No agglutination observed.
◦ Critical results must be communicated promptly to the
requesting physician.
◦ Follow site-specific guidelines for reporting results.
6. Method Limitations:
◦ Refer to the manufacturer's insert for limitations related to
reagent pad and sample quality.
◦ Note any interfering substances that may impact test results
and document accordingly.
7. References:
◦ Monospot test kit manufacturer's protocol and package
insert.
8. Maintenance of Records:
◦ Retain all records for quality control and patient results
according to laboratory policy and CLIA regulations.
◦ Ensure proper documentation of any corrective actions
taken in case of procedure deviations or quality control
failures.

By following this SOP, the laboratory ensures consistency, accuracy,
and compliance in the analysis and reporting of heterophile antibody
(Monospot) tests.
