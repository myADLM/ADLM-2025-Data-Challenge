Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Hexagonal Lupus Anticoagulant, Plasma
1. PURPOSE
This SOP is to outline the procedure for the accurate and timely
analysis of Hexagonal Lupus Anticoagulant (HLA) in plasma. This
test is used to evaluate patients for the presence of lupus
anticoagulant, an antiphospholipid antibody associated with
increased risk of thrombosis.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory personnel trained in coagulation assays
are responsible for performing, recording, and interpreting the
test.
• A supervisor is responsible for confirming abnormal/positive
results and ensuring all results are documented correctly.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/acceptable specimens:
• Plasma samples collected in 3.2% sodium citrate (light blue top
tube).
• Minimum specimen volume: 2.7 mL.
Unacceptable specimens:
• Hemolyzed, clotted, or lipemic specimens.
• Specimens overly delayed in transit or improperly stored.
Handling and storage:
• Specimens must be centrifuged within 4 hours of collection at
1500-3000 x g for 15 minutes to obtain platelet-poor plasma
(PPP).
• Aliquot PPP into labeled plastic tubes and freeze at ≤ -20°C if not
tested immediately.
1. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
Reagents:
• Hexagonal phase phospholipid reagent kit.
• Normal control plasma and lupus anticoagulant control plasma.
Supplies:
• Calibrated micropipettes and tips.
• Polystyrene cuvettes.
• Laboratory timer.
• Coagulation analyzer or spectrophotometer capable of
undertaking clot-based assays.
Storage and handling:
• Follow the manufacturer's instructions for reagent storage and
stability.
• Reconstitute reagents just before the assay if required.
1. EQUIPMENT CALIBRATION AND MAINTENANCE
• Perform calibration checks of coagulation analyzer or
spectrophotometer as per manufacturer’s guidelines.
• Conduct daily quality control using normal and abnormal control
plasmas.
• Document all calibration and maintenance activities in the
equipment log.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation
1. Thaw frozen plasma samples at 37°C in a water bath for 5
minutes and mix gently.
2. Equilibrate all reagents and controls to room temperature.
3. Pipette 0.1 mL of test plasma into labeled cuvettes, ensuring
accurate labeling and documentation.
B. Reagent Addition
1. Add 0.1 mL of Hexagonal phase phospholipid reagent to each
testing cuvette and mix carefully.
2. Prepare controls by pipetting 0.1 mL of normal control plasma
and lupus anticoagulant control plasma into separate cuvettes.
Add reagents as with test samples.
C. Incubation and Mixing
1. Incubate the cuvettes for 5 minutes at 37°C.
D. Coagulation Testing
1. Following incubation, add the clotting factor reagent (e.g.,
calcium chloride) to initiate the reaction.
2. Measure and record the clotting times of samples and controls
using the coagulation analyzer or spectrophotometer.
E. Calculation and Interpretation
1. Calculate the ratio of clotting time in the presence and absence
of hexagonal phase phospholipids.
2. Ratios above the cutoff value (as per kit insert) indicate the
presence of lupus anticoagulant.
3. QUALITY CONTROL
A. Quality Control Materials
1. Include normal and lupus anticoagulant control plasmas in each
run.
2. Document QC test results and verify if they fall within
established acceptable ranges.
B. Result Validation
1. Analyze test records and QC data.
2. Validate results by comparing test values with control values,
checking for consistency.
3. REPORTING RESULTS
• Review and verify all raw data and calculations.
• Document results in laboratory information system (LIS).
• Notify the requesting physician in cases of positive or abnormal
findings.
