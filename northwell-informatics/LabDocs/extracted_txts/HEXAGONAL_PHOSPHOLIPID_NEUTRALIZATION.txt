1. PRINCIPLE AND/OR PURPOSE
Hexagonal phospholipid neutralization (HPN) assay is used to
confirm the presence of lupus anticoagulant (LA) in a patient's
plasma by assessing the ability of hexagonal (II) phase phospholipids
to neutralize LA’s inhibition of clot formation.
1. SPECIMEN
a. Preferred/acceptable: - Buffered citrate plasma, properly frozen at
-70°C and transported on dry ice. - Specimens should be centrifuged
and plasma aliquoted into appropriately labeled cryotubes.
b. Unacceptable: - Specimens received thawed. - EDTA or
heparinized specimens. - Specimens with gross hemolysis or lipemia.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
a. Equipment: - Plate reader capable of measuring absorbance at
405 nm. - Automated coagulation analyzer, preferably one validated
for HPN assay.
b. Reagents: - Hexagonal (II) phase phospholipids. - CaCl2 solution
(0.025M). - Lysis buffer, Tris-HCl (20mM, pH 7.4) containing 1mM
EDTA.
c. Supplies: - Pipettes and pipette tips. - Polystyrene microtiter plates.
- Cryotubes and aliquot labels. - Disposable gloves, lab coat, and
safety goggles.
1. PROCEDURE
a. Preparation: - Thaw frozen plasma samples at room temperature
quickly and gently mix. - Prepare hexagonal (II) phase phospholipids
solution by reconstituting lyophilized hexagonal phospholipid powder
with sterile water according to manufacturer’s instructions. - Prepare
control reagents including negative and positive controls specific to
HPN assay.
b. Testing: 1. Add 100 µl of plasma sample to each well of the
microtiter plate. Perform this in duplicate for reliability. 2. Add 100 µl
of hexagonal (II) phase phospholipids solution to one set of wells
(neutralization wells). 3. Add 100 µl of lysis buffer to the second set of
wells (control wells). 4. Incubate the microtiter plate at room
temperature for 30 minutes. 5. Add 100 µl of CaCl2 solution to all
wells to initiate clot formation. 6. Measure the absorbance at 405 nm
using the plate reader immediately, and then at intervals of 1 min for
15 minutes. 7. Record the rate of absorbance change for both control
and neutralization wells.
c. Interpretation: - Analyze the change in absorbance readings. - If
neutralization wells demonstrate significant absorption changes
compared to control wells, it indicates presence of lupus
anticoagulant. - Confirm HPN assay interpretation using internal QC
controls and guidelines.
d. Quality Control: - Run positive and negative control with every
batch of samples. - Verify that control readings fall within established
range and document findings. - Validate instrument calibration
regularly per manufacturer’s guidelines and document procedure.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
a. Results must be reviewed and verified by the technologist before
reporting. b. Values obtained where neutralization wells significantly
differ from control wells should be reported as “Positive for Lupus
Anticoagulant via HPN Assay.” c. Values reporting nonsignificant
difference should be reported as “Negative for Lupus Anticoagulant
via HPN Assay.”
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
a. Interferences: - Avoid hemolyzed and lipemic samples. - Possible
instrument-related inconsistencies, validate regularly.
b. Precision: - Perform assay in duplicates. - Ensure tight adherence
to protocol for reagent preparation and sample handling.
