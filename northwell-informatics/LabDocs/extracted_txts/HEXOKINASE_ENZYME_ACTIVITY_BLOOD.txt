Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
1. PURPOSE
This procedure outlines the steps to be followed for the analysis of
HEXOKINASE Enzyme Activity, Blood in order to ensure accurate
and reliable results.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all laboratory personnel who perform
hexokinase enzyme activity testing to follow this procedure and
document all actions related to the analysis. Supervisors are
responsible for ensuring staff compliance and addressing any issues
that may arise during the testing process.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen:
• Preferred specimen: 5 mL of heparinized whole blood.
• Collection tube: Lithium heparin (dark green top) or heparinized
vacutainer.
• Specimen must be kept at 2-8°C and analyzed within 72 hours of
collection.
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Specimen not kept at 2-8°C.
• Specimen received more than 72 hours post-collection.
• Specimen that shows hemolysis, clots, or is improperly labeled.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Spectrophotometer
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes and tips
• Incubator (set to 37°C)
Reagents:
• Hexokinase enzyme activity assay kit (follow manufacturer’s
instructions)
• Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase reagent
• ATP reagents
• NADP+
• Buffer solution (provided in kit)
1. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation
• Verify patient identification and specimen details.
• Allow reagents and samples to come to room temperature
(approximately 15-30 minutes).
B) Assay Procedure:
Step 1: Specimen Preparation
• Centrifuge the heparinized blood at 300 x g for 10 minutes at 4°C
to separate plasma.
• Carefully pipette and collect the plasma and transfer to a clean
tube.
Step 2: Reagent Preparation
• Prepare all reagents as per the instructions provided in the
hexokinase enzyme activity assay kit.
Step 3: Assay Set-up
• Set up the reaction as follows:
◦ In a cuvette, add 100 µL of the plasma sample.
◦ Add 1 mL of the reaction buffer.
◦ Add 10 µL of NADP+, 10 µL of ATP, and 10 µL of glucose-6-
phosphate dehydrogenase reagents.
◦ Ensure thorough mixing by gently pipetting up and down.
Step 4: Incubation
• Incubate the reaction mixture at 37°C for 10 minutes.
Step 5: Start Reaction
• Add 100 µL of the hexokinase enzyme reagent to the cuvette to
initiate the reaction.
• Mix well by gently pipetting up and down.
Step 6: Measurement
• Immediately transfer the cuvette to the spectrophotometer and
read the absorbance at 340 nm to record the increase in
absorbance due to the formation of NADPH.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
Quality Control Materials:
• Run all quality control materials (positive and negative controls)
provided with the assay kit by following manufacturer instructions.
• Ensure that the quality control results fall within acceptable
ranges prior to testing patient samples.
Troubleshooting:
• If the quality control results do not fall within acceptable ranges,
do not proceed with patient samples. Re-calibrate the
spectrophotometer, prepare fresh reagents, and repeat the quality
control tests.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Calculate HEXOKINASE enzyme activity from the change in
absorbance at 340 nm using the formula provided in the kit insert.
• Record results in the laboratory information system (LIS).
• Verify results for completeness and accuracy.
• Report critical values immediately to the ordering physician and
document the communication as per lab policy.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Reference intervals for hexokinase enzyme activity will be based on
the kit manufacturer’s guidelines or established laboratory reference
ranges.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to the assay kit insert for specific limitations.
• Ensure samples are processed promptly to avoid degradation of
the enzyme.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions for the HEXOKINASE enzyme activity
assay kit.
• Laboratory specific guidelines for the use of spectrophotometers
and quality control procedures.
1. DOCUMENTATION
• Record all QC results and specimen processing details in the
quality control log.
• Document any deviations from the procedure and the actions
taken to rectify them.
By adhering to this SOP, the laboratory can ensure that
HEXOKINASE enzyme activity is measured accurately and reliably
for appropriate clinical decision-making.
