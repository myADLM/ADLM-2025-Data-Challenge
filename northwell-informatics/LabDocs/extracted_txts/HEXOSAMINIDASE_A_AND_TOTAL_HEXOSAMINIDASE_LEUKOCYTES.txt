Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Title: HEXOSAMINIDASE A
AND TOTAL HEXOSAMINIDASE, LEUKOCYTES
1. PURPOSE:
This SOP outlines the protocol for the analytical phase of generating
results for HEXOSAMINIDASE A and TOTAL HEXOSAMINIDASE in
leukocytes to ensure accurate and reliable test results.
2. SCOPE:
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel trained in
enzymatic assays for HEXOSAMINIDASE A and TOTAL
HEXOSAMINIDASE activity in leukocytes at [Laboratory Name].
3. RESPONSIBILITY:
Laboratory technologists and scientists are responsible for
conducting the assay, performing quality control, and documenting
results according to this SOP. The Laboratory Director or a
designated supervisor ensures compliance with this procedure.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND PREPARATION:
Sample Type: Leukocyte-rich buffy coat isolated from EDTA
anticoagulated whole blood.
Specimen Collection:
• Collect 5-10 mL of whole blood in an EDTA anticoagulant tube.
• Store at 2-8°C.
• Process within 24 hours of collection.
Specimen Preparation:
• Centrifuge the blood sample at 1,500 x g for 10 minutes at 4°C.
• Carefully remove plasma and retain the buffy coat layer.
• Transfer the buffy coat to a clean tube for enzymatic assay.
5. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES:
• Substrate solution: 4-Methylumbelliferyl-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-β-
D-glucopyranoside.
• Buffer solution: 0.1 M Citrate-Phosphate buffer, pH 4.4.
• Internal standard: Known concentration of 4-Methylumbelliferone.
• Extraction buffer: 0.9% NaCl with 0.5% Triton X-100.
• Laboratory supplies: Micropipettes, centrifuge, fluorometer, and
assay plates.
6. QUALITY CONTROL:
Quality Control Material:
• HIGH and LOW Hexosaminidase controls provided by an
accredited supplier.
• Run quality controls with each batch of patient samples.
Calibration:
• Calibrate the fluorometer at least monthly using standards
provided by the manufacturer.
• Ensure calibration curves are linear and meet acceptance criteria
before running samples.
7. PROCEDURE:
A. Enzyme Extraction:
1. Perform the enzyme extraction by adding 500 µL of extraction
buffer to the leukocyte-rich buffy coat.
2. Vortex and incubate at 4°C for 30 minutes.
3. Centrifuge the lysate at 12,000 x g for 5 minutes and collect the
supernatant.
B. Assay Setup:
1. In a microassay plate, add 50 µL of substrate solution to each
well.
2. Add 50 µL of leukocyte lysate supernatant to corresponding
wells.
3. For Total Hexosaminidase activity, incubate at 37°C for 1 hour.
4. For Hexosaminidase A activity, pre-incubate with an inhibitor
specific for Hexosaminidase B (e.g., N-Acetyl-D-
Galactosamine) for 30 minutes at room temperature, then
proceed with substrate addition and incubation.
5. Stop the reaction by adding 200 µL of 0.2 M Glycine-NaOH
buffer (pH 10.4).
C. Measurement:
1. Measure fluorescence in a fluorometer at an excitation
wavelength of 365 nm and an emission wavelength of 450 nm.
2. Record fluorescence readings.
8. CALCULATIONS:
1. Calculate HEXOSAMINIDASE activities using the standard
curve generated from the known 4-Methylumbelliferone
concentrations.
2. Determine the Total Hexosaminidase activity in units/mg
protein.
3. Calculate Hexosaminidase A activity separately using the pre-
incubated samples.
4. Subtract Hexosaminidase A activity from the Total
Hexosaminidase activity to calculate Hexosaminidase B activity.
9. REPORTING RESULTS:
Referencing ranges:
• Hexosaminidase A: XX to XX units/mg protein (reference range to
be defined based on validation data)
• Total Hexosaminidase: XX to XX units/mg protein (reference
range to be defined based on validation data)
Documentation:
• Results should be documented in the Laboratory Information
System (LIS) ensuring accurate transcription.
• Verify and validate results before issuing the final report.
Critical Results:
• Critical values should be communicated to the requesting
physician immediately following laboratory protocol.
10. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
• Hemolyzed samples may distort enzymatic activity readings.
• Incorrect specimen handling can significantly impact results.
11. REFERENCES:
• Standard reference texts for enzymatic assays.
• Manufacturer’s instructions for reagents and equipment used in
the assay.
