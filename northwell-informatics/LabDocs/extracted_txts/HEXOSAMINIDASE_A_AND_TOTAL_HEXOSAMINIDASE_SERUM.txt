Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analysis of
HEXOSAMINIDASE A AND TOTAL HEXOSAMINIDASE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized protocol for the analysis and reporting
results of Hexosaminidase A and Total Hexosaminidase activity in
serum samples, ensuring accurate and reliable results.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to the analytical phase of testing Hexosaminidase A
and Total Hexosaminidase for serum specimens in the laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all designated laboratory personnel to
perform and document the assay according to this protocol. It is the
responsibility of the supervisory staff to ensure compliance with this
procedure and address any deviations or issues.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred/acceptable specimens:
◦ Serum collected in red-top tubes.
◦ Serum should be separated from cells as soon as possible
and frozen if not immediately tested.
• Unacceptable specimens:
◦ Hemolyzed or lipemic serum samples.
◦ Serum samples that have been inadequately stored (e.g., not
kept frozen if not promptly tested).
5. MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT
• Reagents and standards for Hexosaminidase A and Total
Hexosaminidase assays.
• Calibrators and quality controls.
• UV-Vis Spectrophotometer or equivalent reader.
• Incubator set at 37°C.
• Pipettes and pipette tips (calibrated).
• Microcentrifuge tubes.
• Test tubes or microplates for reagent mixing.
• Vortex mixer.
• Ice bath.
• Timer.
• Laboratory notebook and Computer with LIS access.
6. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation of Reagents and Calibration
• Prepare reagents and calibration standards as per the
manufacturer’s instructions or laboratory validated methods.
• Ensure all reagents are equilibrated to room temperature prior to
use.
• Label all reagents, controls, and calibrators appropriately and
record preparation in the laboratory log.
B. Sample Preparation
• Thaw frozen serum samples on ice.
• Vortex to mix and centrifuge briefly to remove any particulate
matter.
• Aliquot the necessary volume of serum for the assay.
C. Assay Procedure
• In a test tube or well plate, add the appropriate volume of serum
sample, control, and calibrator to the assay reagent.
• Incubate the reaction mixture at 37°C for the recommended time
(as specified in the assay kit instructions).
• Terminate the reaction by adding the stop solution if required.
• Measure the absorbance using a UV-Vis spectrophotometer set to
the appropriate wavelength as specified in the assay instructions.
• Record the absorbance values.
D. Calculation and Interpretation of Results
• Calculate Hexosaminidase A and Total Hexosaminidase activity
by comparing sample absorbance to the standard curve
generated with the calibration standards.
• The results should be expressed in appropriate units (e.g., nmol/
hour/mL).
• Hexosaminidase A activity should be expressed as a percentage
of the Total Hexosaminidase activity.
• Calculate Total Hexosaminidase as follows: Total Hexosaminidase
= Hexosaminidase A + Hexosaminidase B.
E. Quality Control
• Run controls and calibrators with each batch of tests.
• Compare control results with established ranges to ensure assay
integrity.
• If controls are out of range, troubleshoot and rerun the assay
before reporting any patient results.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Ensure a second technologist verifies results before final release.
• Results should include interpretative comments if applicable,
specifying normal and abnormal ranges.
• Follow site-specific reporting guidelines.
8. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Refer to the established reference ranges provided with the assay
kit or laboratory-validated ranges.
9. QUALITY ASSURANCE
• Verify calibration of equipment daily per SOP and document.
• Ensure all pipettes and other equipment used in the procedure
are calibrated and functioning correctly.
• Perform daily maintenance on spectrophotometer and other
analytical instruments. Ensure periodic review and validation of
SOPs.
10. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• The sensitivity and specificity are dependent on the assay kit
used and adherence to manufacturer instructions.
• Hemolyzed samples can lead to erroneous results.

12. DOCUMENTATION
• Record all processes and results.
• Maintain logs of specimen receipt, assay runs, control results, and
any deviations from the SOP.
• Carefully document any corrective actions taken for quality control
failures.
