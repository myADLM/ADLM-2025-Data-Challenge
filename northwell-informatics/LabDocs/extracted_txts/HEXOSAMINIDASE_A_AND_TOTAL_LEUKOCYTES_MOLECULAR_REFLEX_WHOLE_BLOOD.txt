Standard Operating Procedure for Analyzing HEXOSAMINIDASE
A AND TOTAL, LEUKOCYTES/MOLECULAR REFLEX, WHOLE
BLOOD
1. PURPOSE
To accurately measure Hexosaminidase A and total enzyme activity
in leukocytes from whole blood specimens and to perform molecular
reflex testing where indicated. This protocol ensures quality and
consistency in results to aid in the diagnosis of Tay-Sachs disease
and other related conditions.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all personnel involved in the analytical phase of
Hexosaminidase A and total activity testing in our CLIA-certified
laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of designated laboratory personnel to perform
and document all analyses according to this SOP and to follow all
quality control and corrective action procedures. It is also the
responsibility of laboratory supervisors to ensure compliance with this
SOP.
4. MATERIALS REQUIRED
• Whole blood specimens collected in EDTA tubes
• Hexosaminidase Assay Kit
• Appropriate molecular reflex testing reagents and kits
• Water bath, centrifuge, and spectrophotometer
• Calibrated micropipettes and tips
• Vortex mixer
• Leukocyte isolation media
• Freezer (-20°C) and refrigerator (2-8°C)
• Quality control materials
• Laboratory logbook and documentation forms
5. PROCEDURE
5.1 Specimen Preparation
1. Receive and Accession Specimen: Confirm sample identity
and integrity. Specimens must arrive with correct labeling and
within specified transport conditions.
2. Leukocyte Isolation:
◦ Centrifuge whole blood at 300-400g for 10 minutes to
separate plasma from cells.
◦ Carefully remove plasma and retain the leukocyte-
containing buffy coat.
◦ Resuspend the buffy coat in an appropriate volume of ice-
cold leukocyte isolation buffer.
3. Leukocyte Counting:
◦ Use a hemocytometer or automated cell counter to
determine leukocyte concentration.
5.2 Enzyme Assay Procedure
1. Reaction Set-Up:
◦ Prepare assay buffer and substrate mix according to the
Hexosaminidase Assay Kit instructions.
◦ Pipette appropriate volumes of patient leukocyte
suspension, controls, and reagents into 96-well plates or
appropriate assay tubes.
◦ Include blank and quality control samples in each run.
2. Incubation:
◦ Incubate the reaction mixture at 37°C for the specified time
ensuring thorough mixing.
3. Termination and Reading:
◦ Stop the reaction with stop solution provided in the kit.
◦ Measure fluorescence or absorbance using a calibrated
spectrophotometer.
5.3 Calculation and Interpretation
1. Data Analysis:
◦ Calculate enzyme activity using standard curves and control
data: Enzyme activity (units) = (Sample readout - Blank)/
Protein or cell count.
2. Quality Control:
◦ Verify that all control results are within acceptable ranges
before accepting patient results.
3. Reference Ranges:
◦ Reference ranges and interpretation guidelines must be
followed to determine Hexosaminidase A and total activity
levels.
5.4 Molecular Reflex Testing
1. Molecular Reflex Indication:
◦ If Hexosaminidase A activity is below the reference range,
proceed with molecular reflex testing.
2. DNA Extraction:
◦ Extract DNA from leukocytes using an appropriate DNA
extraction kit.
3. PCR and Genetic Analysis:
◦ Perform PCR amplification and sequence analysis of
relevant genes (e.g., HEXA gene).
◦ Follow molecular testing SOPs for sample handling, PCR
setup, and sequence analysis.
6. QUALITY CONTROL AND CALIBRATION
1. Quality Control:
◦ Run negative and positive controls with each batch of tests.
2. Calibration:
◦ Calibrate spectrophotometer and other equipment as per
manufacturer’s recommendations.
3. Documentation:
◦ Record all QC and calibration activities in the laboratory
logbook.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Validation: All results must be reviewed and validated by a
licensed laboratory technologist.
2. Reporting: Enter validated results into the LIS (Laboratory
Information System).
3. Critical Results Notification: Notify the requesting physician
immediately for any critical results as defined in the laboratory
critical values policy.
8. TROUBLESHOOTING
1. Leukocyte Purity: Ensure minimal contamination from other
cell types during leukocyte isolation.
2. Enzyme Stability: Maintain samples on ice and analyze
promptly to avoid enzyme degradation.
3. Equipment Errors: Check instrument calibration and reagent
validity if unexpected results are obtained.
4. Repeated Failures: If repeated assay or molecular testing
failures occur, review procedural steps and consult with a
supervisor for further troubleshooting.
