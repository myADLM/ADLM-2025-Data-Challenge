Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Generating Results for
Hexosaminidase A, Serum
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the accurate and timely
analysis of serum Hexosaminidase A activity to support diagnostic
and therapeutic decisions.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to the analytical phase of processing serum
samples specifically for Hexosaminidase A determination at our
CLIA-certified laboratory. Personnel involved in the analysis must
follow these procedures strictly to ensure the integrity and accuracy
of results.
3. RESPONSIBILITIES
• Laboratory Technicians: Responsible for preparing and
analyzing samples according to this protocol.
• Laboratory Supervisor: Responsible for overseeing operations
and ensuring compliance with this SOP.
• Quality Control Officer: Responsible for verifying quality control
results and addressing any discrepancies.
4. DEFINITIONS
• Hexosaminidase A (Hex A): An enzyme used to diagnose Tay-
Sachs disease and other conditions related to enzyme deficiency.
• Serum: The liquid portion of blood obtained after removal of cells
and clotting factors.
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred Specimen: 2-5 mL of serum collected in a red-top tube
or SST (serum separator tube).
• Unacceptable Specimens: Specimens containing clots,
hemolysis, lipemia, or obtained more than 72 hours prior to
analysis.
• Storage: Keep samples refrigerated at 2-8°C. If analysis is
delayed for more than 72 hours, freeze at -20°C.
6. MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT
• Enzyme substrate solution specific for Hexosaminidase A
• Fluorometric microplate reader or equivalent
• Microcentrifuge tubes
• Micropipettes and sterile tips
• Incubator (set to 37°C)
7. REAGENTS
• Hex A substrate (e.g., 4-Methylumbelliferyl-β-D-N-
acetylglucosaminide)
• Reaction Buffer
• Stop Solution (e.g., Glycine buffer or equivalent)
8. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation
1. Specimen Handling:
◦ Ensure specimens are stored properly.
◦ Bring frozen specimens to room temperature before
analysis.
2. Preparation of Reagents:
◦ Prepare substrate and reaction buffer according to
manufacturer instructions.
◦ Equilibrate all reagents to room temperature before use.
3. Quality Controls:
◦ Run positive and negative controls with each batch of
samples.
B. Analytical Process
1. Sample Preparation:
◦ Label microcentrifuge tubes for each sample, control, and
blank.
◦ Pipette 50 µL of serum into the respective tubes.
◦ Add 50 µL of reaction buffer to each tube.
2. Enzyme Reaction:
◦ Add 50 µL of Hex A substrate to each tube.
◦ Mix contents gently but thoroughly.
◦ Incubate tubes at 37°C for 30 minutes.
3. Terminating Reaction:
◦ Stop the reaction by adding 200 µL of Stop Solution to each
tube.
4. Measurement:
◦ Transfer 200 µL of the reaction mixture to a microplate.
◦ Measure fluorescence intensity at 365 nm excitation and
450 nm emission using a fluorometric microplate reader.
5. Calculation of Enzyme Activity:
◦ Calculate Hex A activity using the standard curve created
from known concentrations of the substrate.
◦ Express results in nmol/hour/mL for Hexosaminidase A
activity.
C. Post-Analysis
1. Documentation:
◦ Record results in the laboratory information system (LIS).
◦ Review all results for accuracy and completeness.
2. Quality Control Verification:
◦ Ensure control results are within the acceptable range
before validating patient results.
◦ If controls are out of range, troubleshoot the issue before re-
running patient samples.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results are entered into the LIS for review and validation by a
designated technologist.
• Critical values or unexpected results should be reviewed by a
supervisor before reporting to the clinician.
10. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform routine calibration of the microplate reader as per
manufacturer's instructions.
• Conduct periodic proficiency testing to ensure accuracy and
precision.
• Maintain reagent and calibration logs according to laboratory
policy.
