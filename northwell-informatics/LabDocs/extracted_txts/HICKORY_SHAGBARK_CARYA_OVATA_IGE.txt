STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP) Title: Analytical
Phase of Generating Results for Hickory Shagbark (Carya
Ovata) IgE
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this standard operating procedure (SOP) is to outline
the steps and protocols for the analytical phase of generating results
for Hickory Shagbark (Carya Ovata) IgE levels in patient samples.
This SOP ensures accurate, reliable, and reproducible results,
contributing to appropriate patient diagnosis and management.
1. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel involved in allergy
testing using the ImmunoCAP system or any other designated
assays for determining Specific IgE levels against Hickory Shagbark
(Carya Ovata) allergens.
1. DEFINITIONS
IgE: Immunoglobulin E, an antibody that plays a critical role in
allergic reactions. Hickory Shagbark (Carya Ovata) IgE: Specific
IgE antibody targeting allergens from Hickory Shagbark (Carya
Ovata).
1. RESPONSIBILITIES
Laboratory Technologists: Responsible for conducting the assay as
per defined protocols, recording the results, and ensuring quality
control measures are followed.
Laboratory Supervisors: Responsible for overseeing the process,
troubleshooting issues, ensuring all quality control measures are
adhered to, and verifying results prior to release.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• ImmunoCAP system or other designated assay platforms for
Specific IgE testing
• Hickory Shagbark (Carya Ovata) allergen reagent
• Calibrators and controls
• Sample diluents and buffers
• Wash solutions
• Disposable pipettes and tips
• Microtiter plates or specific assay cartridges
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
1. PROCEDURE
6.1 Pre-Analytical Preparation
• Ensure that the specimen has been properly collected and
accessioned.
• Centrifuge the serum sample, if necessary, to remove particulates
or clotted material.
• Label all necessary equipment and reagents as per laboratory
standards.
6.2 Calibration and Quality Control
• Run calibrators for the specific IgE assay according to the
manufacturer's protocol before testing patient samples.
• Perform internal quality controls, including running high, medium,
and low IgE level controls to validate the assay. Document the
control results.
• Proceed with sample testing only if quality control results are
within acceptable ranges.
6.3 Sample Handling
• Aliquot patient serum samples and control samples into the
designated wells of the microtiter plate or assay cartridges as per
platform instructions.
• Add required reagents, such as buffers and enzyme conjugates,
in the designated sequence and volumes.
• Follow specific incubation times and temperature settings as per
the assay kit manufacturer's instructions.
6.4 Wash Steps
• Perform wash steps between reagent additions to remove
unbound components, minimizing background noise and
enhancing assay specificity.
• Use automated or manual washing techniques as stipulated by
the assay protocol, ensuring that each wash step is performed
consistently.
6.5 Detection and Measurement
• Add substrate solutions to initiate colorimetric, luminescent, or
fluorescent signal development based on the assay used.
• Incubate for the appropriate time to allow signal generation and
then stop the reaction as described in the assay protocol.
• Measure the signal using the respective detection system (e.g.,
photometric, fluorometric).
6.6 Data Analysis and Interpretation
• Analyze the signal intensities against the calibration curve to
determine the specific IgE concentrations in patient samples.
• Record the raw data, calculated IgE levels, and any other relevant
information (e.g., repeat analysis results) in a secure laboratory
information system (LIS).
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Review each result for consistency and against established
reference ranges.
• Verify results with internal QC results to ensure accuracy before
releasing.
• Enter the results into the LIS with a clear annotation of the
specific IgE level for Hickory Shagbark (Carya Ovata).
1. QUALITY CONTROL
Implement routine checks as per laboratory policy, including:
• Regular calibration of assay instruments.
• Validation of new reagent lots.
• Periodic proficiency testing to assess assay performance.
• Documentation of all quality control measures and corrective
actions, if needed.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Reference intervals for Hickory Shagbark (Carya Ovata) IgE levels
will follow those provided by assay manufacturers or established in
the laboratory through validation studies.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Ensure that the assay sensitivity and specificity are well
understood, especially regarding cross-reactivity with other
allergens.
• Be aware of potential interference factors such as hemolysis,
lipemia, or high bilirubin levels that could affect assay
performance.
