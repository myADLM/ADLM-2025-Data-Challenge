STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP) FOR HIGH-
PERFORMANCE LIQUID CHROMATOGRAPHY (HPLC)
HEMOGLOBIN VARIANT, BLOOD
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is to
provide a standardized protocol for generating and reporting results
for Hemoglobin Variant analysis in blood using High-Performance
Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). The procedure ensures accurate,
reliable, and reproducible findings crucial for diagnosing
hemoglobinopathies.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel conducting HPLC
Hemoglobin Variant analysis in the CLIA-certified laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated trained laboratory personnel are responsible for
performing the HPLC Hemoglobin Variant analysis according to this
SOP. It is the responsibility of the staff to identify and report any
deviations, issues, or equipment malfunctions to the supervisor
immediately.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Whole blood
• Collection Container: EDTA anticoagulant tube (lavender top)
• Specimen Volume: Minimum 3 mL of whole blood
• Stability: Specimen should be refrigerated at 2-8°C and analyzed
within 7 days of collection.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) system
• Hemoglobin variant analytical column
• Prepared elution buffers and reagents specific to the HPLC
system
• Quality control materials (commercial 2-level hemoglobin variant
controls)
• Calibrators
• Laboratory consumables including syringes, pipettes, sample
vials, gloves, and lab notebooks
6. CALIBRATION AND MAINTENANCE
• Perform daily calibration of the HPLC analyzer with appropriate
calibrators.
• Conduct routine maintenance and inspection of the HPLC system
according to the manufacturer's guidelines.
• Document all calibration and maintenance activities in the
equipment logbook.
7. PROCEDURE
7.1 Preparing Samples
• Ensure specimens are properly labeled and stored at 2-8°C.
• Allow specimens to reach room temperature before analysis.
• Mix the blood specimen thoroughly by inverting the tube multiple
times.
7.2 System Setup
• Turn on the HPLC system and allow it to equilibrate.
• Load the hemoglobin variant analysis method as defined by the
instrument manufacturer.
• Prime the HPLC with the specified running buffers.
7.3 Running Samples
• Load control and calibrator samples to ensure system readiness
and accuracy.
• Inject 10 µL of the control sample and run according to the
manufacturer's guidelines.
• Verify that control sample results are within the expected range.
7.4 Sample Injection
• Prepare the patient specimens by transferring an aliquot to a
clean sample vial.
• Load the sample carousel with the prepared patient samples,
alternating with control samples.
• Initiate the HPLC run sequence according to the predetermined
method parameters (flow rate, column temperature, buffer
composition, etc.).
7.5 Data Acquisition and Analysis
• Monitor the chromatographic peaks and ensure proper
integration.
• Identify and quantify hemoglobin variants, comparing retention
times with known standards.
• Record chromatogram data including retention time, peak area,
and integrated results.
7.6 Post-Run Procedures
• Perform a system wash and clean the HPLC as per the
manufacturer’s instructions after completing the run.
• Properly dispose of used vials and remaining specimens
according to biohazard waste protocols.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
• Analyze quality control materials at the beginning and end of each
batch run.
• QC checks must be within the defined control limits. If out of
range, troubleshoot any potential source of error before re-
analysis.
• Document and retain all QC data for long-term quality monitoring.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
• Transmit the HPLC results through the LIS system.
• Review all chromatograms and data for consistency and
accuracy.
• Results must be verified by a technologist before release.
• Report any abnormal or critical results promptly to the responsible
clinician following lab reporting guidelines.
10. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Normal Hemoglobin A: 95-98%
• Hemoglobin A2: 1.5-3.5%
• Hemoglobin F: <2%
• Variants: Refer to specific variant reference ranges as defined by
the laboratory’s SOP.
11. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Analysis is limited to the identification of common hemoglobin
variants.
• Rare or novel variants may require additional testing.
• High levels of hemolysis may interfere with analysis.
