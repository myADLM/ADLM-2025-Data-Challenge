Title: Analytical Phase of Generating Results for HIGH MOBILITY
GROUP A2 (HMGA2) Immunostain, Technical Component Only
1. PURPOSE
To outline the steps and provide clear guidance for the technical
component of performing HIGH MOBILITY GROUP A2 (HMGA2)
immunostaining to ensure consistent and accurate results.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue
sections
• Section Thickness: 4-5 microns

samples, sections thicker than 5 microns
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Microtome
• Water bath (45-50°C)
• Microscope slides (positive-charged)
• HMGA2 primary antibody
• Secondary antibody (HRP-conjugated)
• Detection system: DAB (3,3'-diaminobenzidine) substrate kit
• Counterstain: Hematoxylin
• Deparaffinization reagents: Xylene and ethanol
• Retrieval solution: EDTA-based or Citrate buffer
• Wash buffer: Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with Tween 20
• Mounting media
• Coverslips
• Humidity chamber
• Autostainer (if available)
4. PROCEDURE
4.1 Slide Preparation
1. Cut FFPE tissue sections into 4-5 micron thickness using a
microtome.
2. Float sections on a 45-50°C water bath and mount on positive-
charged microscope slides.
3. Air-dry slides at room temperature and bake slides at 60°C for 1
hour to ensure adhesion.
4.2 Deparaffinization and Rehydration
1. Deparaffinize slides in xylene:
◦ Xylene I: 10 minutes
◦ Xylene II: 10 minutes
2. Rehydrate slides through graded ethanol series:
◦ 100% ethanol: 5 minutes
◦ 95% ethanol: 5 minutes
◦ 70% ethanol: 5 minutes
3. Rinse slides in running distilled water for 2 minutes.
4.3 Antigen Retrieval
1. Place slides in a microwave-safe container filled with retrieval
solution.
2. Microwave at medium-high power for 10-15 minutes, ensuring
the temperature reaches 95-100°C.
3. Allow slides to cool in retrieval solution at room temperature for
20 minutes.
4. Rinse slides in PBS with Tween 20, three times for 5 minutes
each.
4.4 Immunostaining
1. Block endogenous peroxidase activity by incubating slides with
3% hydrogen peroxide in PBS for 10 minutes.
2. Wash slides with PBS with Tween 20, three times for 5 minutes
each.
3. Block non-specific bindings using blocking serum (species-
specific) for 20 minutes at room temperature in a humidity
chamber.
4. Incubate slides with HMGA2 primary antibody diluted in
antibody diluent for 1 hour at room temperature or overnight at
4°C.
5. Wash slides with PBS with Tween 20, three times for 5 minutes
each.
6. Incubate slides with HRP-conjugated secondary antibody for 30
minutes at room temperature.
7. Wash slides with PBS with Tween 20, three times for 5 minutes
each.
4.5 Detection and Counterstain
1. Incubate slides with DAB substrate solution until brown color
development is observed (generally 5-10 minutes).
2. Rinse slides in running distilled water.
3. Counterstain with hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes.
4. Rinse slides in running distilled water.
5. Dehydrate slides through graded ethanol series:
◦ 70% ethanol: 1 minute
◦ 95% ethanol: 1 minute
◦ 100% ethanol: 1 minute
6. Clear slides in xylene for 3 minutes each, twice.
4.6 Mounting and Viewing
1. Mount slides using appropriate mounting media.
2. Apply coverslips and allow slides to dry.
3. Examine slides under a microscope, ensuring proper staining
quality.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include positive controls (known HMGA2 positive tissue) and
negative controls (omitting primary antibody) with each staining
run.
• Record QC results and corrective actions taken when controls fail.
• Validate new lots of antibodies and reagents before use.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
• Technologists must document all observations and ensure
accurate identification of staining patterns.
• Ensure results are passed to the pathologist or appropriate
individual for interpretation and reporting.
7. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's insert for HMGA2 antibody
• Standard histology textbooks and staining manuals
• Internal quality control logs and standard laboratory protocols
8. NOTES
• Ensure all reagents are within their expiry date.
• Maintain a clean and organized workstation to avoid cross-
contamination.
• Handle all specimens with appropriate PPE and follow biosafety
guidelines.
