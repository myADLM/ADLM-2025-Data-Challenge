SOP for the Analytical Phase of Generating Results for High
Molecular Weight Kininogen (HMWK) Factor Referral Laboratory
Testing
1. PURPOSE
To define the standard procedures for the analytical assessment,
generation, and reporting of High Molecular Weight Kininogen
(HMWK) factor testing in the referral laboratory, ensuring accuracy,
reliability, and compliance with regulatory standards.
Responsibility:
• It is the responsibility of designated laboratory personnel to
perform the HMWK factor testing accurately according to this
protocol.
• It is the responsibility of all staff to promptly identify any issues or
non-conformance in the analytical process and report them to the
laboratory supervisor.
• It is the responsibility of the laboratory supervisor to ensure that
all procedures are followed, including any required corrective
actions.
1. SCOPE
This protocol applies to all personnel involved in the testing, analysis,
and reporting of HMWK factor samples within the referral laboratory.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Plate reader calibrated for HMWK assay
• Reagent kits for HMWK factor assay, validated and within
expiration date
• Calibration controls
• Precision micropipettes and tips
• Sample tubes and storage containers
• Centrifuge
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND HANDLING
Specimen:
• Preferred: Citrated plasma (3.2% sodium citrate)
• Unacceptable: Hemolyzed, lipemic, or clotted samples
Specimen Collection and Handling:
• Transport frozen plasma on dry ice to maintain sample integrity.
• Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
• Store plasma samples at -70°C until analysis.
1. TEST PROCEDURE
5.1 Preparation
• Ensure all reagents and equipment are prepared and calibrated
according to the manufacturer's instructions.
• Equilibrate reagents and samples to room temperature before
use.
• Verify that controls and calibration standards are within their
expiration dates and have been stored correctly.
5.2 Assay Procedure
1. Thaw plasma samples and controls at 37°C in a water bath or
at room temperature.
2. Prepare the working reagents as per the assay kit instructions.
3. Pipette the appropriate volume of plasma samples, controls,
and standards into designated wells of the assay plate.
4. Add the specific reagents according to the assay protocol.
5. Incubate the plate at the specified temperature and duration as
outlined in the assay instructions.
6. Measure the resulting absorbance or endpoint as per the
reader’s manual.
5.3 Quality Control
• Run calibration controls at the beginning and end of each batch of
samples to ensure assay validity.
• Include both positive and negative controls with each run.
• Acceptable limits for controls should be as defined by the
manufacturer’s instructions.
• Document all quality control results for review and validation.
5.4 Troubleshooting
• If controls fall outside the accepted range, investigate potential
assay issues such as reagent contamination, equipment
malfunction, or human error.
• Re-run the assay if necessary after resolving identified issues.
• Record all corrective actions taken.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Review the assay outcome data to confirm that results are within
expected ranges for calibration and control samples.
• Enter verified results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
for cross-referencing and reporting.
• Ensure that critical values are immediately communicated to the
appropriate healthcare providers in accordance with laboratory
protocol.
• Document all results, including any calculations, and maintain
records as per regulatory requirements.
1. MAINTENANCE
• Perform routine maintenance on all equipment according to the
manufacturer’s guidelines.
• Regularly update and calibrate the assay systems to ensure
ongoing accuracy and compliance.
1. SAFETY AND COMPLIANCE
• Adhere to all safety guidelines, including the use of PPE and
proper waste disposal.
• Ensure compliance with all relevant regulatory standards and
quality assurance protocols.
• Keep up-to-date with training on new procedures and best
practices.
1. REFERENCES
Refer to the manufacturer's package insert for the HMWK factor
assay kit, equipment manuals, and internal laboratory protocols for
detailed technical information and additional procedural guidance.
1. DOCUMENTATION
Maintain thorough records of all steps in the analysis process,
including test results, quality control data, troubleshooting steps, and
corrective actions. These records must be stored securely and be
accessible for review during internal and external audits.
