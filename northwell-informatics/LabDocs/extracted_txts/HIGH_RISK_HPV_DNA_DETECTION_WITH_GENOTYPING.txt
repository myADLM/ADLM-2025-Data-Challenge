High Risk HPV DNA Detection with
Genotyping
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for detecting and genotyping high-risk
Human Papillomavirus (HPV) DNA from clinical specimens using a
certified molecular diagnostic test. Accurate detection and genotyping
help in the diagnosis, management, and follow-up of patients at risk
for cervical cancer and other HPV-associated diseases.
2. SCOPE
This protocol applies to all laboratory personnel involved in the
molecular analysis of specimens for high-risk HPV DNA detection
and genotyping.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory personnel to follow
this protocol accurately to ensure the validity and reproducibility of
test results. Supervisors are required to ensure the staff's adherence
to this protocol and to address any deviations promptly.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND HANDLING
Specimen Type:
• Cervical swabs collected in appropriate transport media.
• Other accepted specimens include vaginal swabs, anal swabs,
and oropharyngeal swabs if indicated clinically.
Specimen Storage:
• Store specimens at 2-8°C and process within 7 days.
• For longer storage, freeze specimens at -20°C or lower.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens collected in expired transport media.
• Specimens that are leaked or received in inappropriate
containers.
• Improperly labelled specimens or those with missing date and
time of collection.
• Specimens showing signs of contamination.
5. MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT
• Certified Molecular Diagnostic Kit for High Risk HPV DNA
Detection with Genotyping
• DNA extraction kits
• Real-time PCR thermocycler
• Nuclease-free tubes, pipettes, and tips
• Calibrated micropipettes and appropriate disposal containers
• Cold storage facilities
6. PROCEDURE
A. DNA Extraction
1. Preparation:
◦ Wear appropriate PPE.
◦ Label nuclease-free tubes for each specimen.
2. Lysis:
◦ Add the required volume of specimen to the lysis buffer as
per the extraction kit instructions.
◦ Vortex and incubate for a specified period at the required
temperature.
3. DNA Binding:
◦ Transfer the lysate to the DNA-binding column.
◦ Spin down and wash using the provided wash buffers.
4. Elution:
◦ Elute the DNA using the elution buffer.
◦ Store the eluted DNA at 2-8°C for short-term use or -20°C
for long-term storage.
B. Real-Time PCR Amplification and Detection
1. PCR Preparation:
◦ Thaw reagents and prepare the PCR master mix as per the
kit instructions.
◦ Aliquot the master mix into PCR tubes or plates.
2. Sample Addition:
◦ Add the extracted DNA to the PCR tubes/plates containing
the master mix.
◦ Prepare positive and negative controls along with the
samples.
3. Amplification:
◦ Place the PCR tubes/plates in the real-time PCR
thermocycler.
◦ Set the thermocycler parameters as specified in the kit
instructions.
4. Detection:
◦ Monitor the amplification in real-time.
◦ Ensure that the controls are performing as expected.
7. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
1. Positive Control:
◦ Ensure the positive control has amplified at the specified
threshold.
2. Negative Control:
◦ Confirm that no amplification occurs in the negative control.
3. Sample Results:
◦ Analyze the amplification curves and determine the
presence or absence of high-risk HPV DNA.
◦ If multiple genotypes are detected, determine the specific
types based on the generated signals.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run the internal and external quality controls with each batch of
samples.
• Document and review the control results. Any deviation must be
addressed immediately.
• Quarterly participate in external proficiency testing to ensure test
accuracy.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
• Validate the results according to the laboratory’s reporting
guidelines.
• Positive results should be communicated promptly to the
requesting clinician.
• Report any genotyping data along with the DNA detection results.
10. SAFETY AND TROUBLESHOOTING
• Follow all laboratory safety protocols to handle potential
biohazards.
• In case of contamination or inconsistent controls, repeat the test
with the new aliquot of the specimen.
• Refer to manufacturer guidelines for detailed troubleshooting
steps.
11. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Any limitations specified in the kit insert should be acknowledged.
• DNA quality and specimen integrity are crucial for accurate
detection.
12. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's instructions and analysis guidelines provided with
the HPV DNA Genotyping kit.
• Relevant laboratory safety protocols.
13. REVIEW
This protocol should be reviewed annually or as needed when new
procedures or instruments are introduced.
This Standard Operating Procedure ensures the accuracy, reliability,
and efficiency of high-risk HPV DNA detection and genotyping in
clinical specimens, following strict quality control measures and
safety guidelines.
