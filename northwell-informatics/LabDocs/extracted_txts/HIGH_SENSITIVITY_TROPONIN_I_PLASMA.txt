Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for High Sensitivity Troponin I, Plasma
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the procedure for the accurate and timely
measurement of high sensitivity Troponin I (hs-TnI) in plasma
samples. High sensitivity Troponin I is a critical biomarker used in the
diagnosis and management of myocardial infarction and other forms
of cardiac injury. The procedure ensures that results are generated
under consistent and controlled conditions to maintain data integrity
and accuracy.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all qualified laboratory staff to adhere to this
procedure, ensuring that the hs-TnI testing is performed correctly and
that any issues encountered during the analytical phase are brought
to the attention of a supervisor.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
• Specimen Type: Plasma collected in a lithium heparin or EDTA
tube.
• Volume: Minimum 2 mL of fresh plasma.
• Collection Guidelines:
◦ Avoid hemolysis by careful venipuncture and gentle handling
of the tube.
◦ Ensure proper tube filling to avoid inappropriate anticoagulant-
to-blood ratio.
• Stability:
◦ Room temperature: Stable for up to 2 hours.
◦ Refrigerated (2-8°C): Stable for up to 24 hours.
◦ Frozen (-20°C or lower): Stable for up to 6 months. Avoid
multiple freeze-thaw cycles.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Automated analyzer capable of hs-TnI measurement (e.g., Roche
Cobas E411, Abbott Architect i2000SR).
• Calibrators and Controls specific to the assay.
• Reagents specific to hs-TnI assay.
• Personal protective equipment (PPE).
5. PROCEDURE
1. Preparation:
◦ Check and prepare the analyzer according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
◦ Ensure that all reagents, calibrators, and controls are within
their expiration dates and have been stored correctly.
◦ Allow reagents to reach room temperature if stored
refrigerated prior to use.
2. Calibration:
◦ Perform calibration according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
◦ Document the calibration results and ensure they meet the
acceptable criteria before proceeding.
3. Quality Control:
◦ Run two levels of quality control material at the beginning of
each shift, after calibration, and following significant
maintenance or reagent changes.
◦ Document QC results and ensure they are within the
reference ranges specified by the manufacturer.
◦ Investigate any out-of-range QC results before proceeding
with patient samples.
4. Sample Analysis:
◦ Verify that the plasma samples are correctly labeled and
match the test requisition forms.
◦ Centrifuge the blood collection tubes according to laboratory
protocol and transfer plasma to a new labeled tube.
◦ Load the plasma samples onto the analyzer according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
◦ Input the relevant patient and test information into the
analyzer.
◦ Initiate the analysis cycle on the analyzer.
5. Data Review:
◦ Upon completion of the analysis, review the generated
results for each sample.
◦ Pay special attention to any flagged results or error codes
generated by the analyzer.
◦ Investigate any inconsistencies or errors according to the
laboratory’s troubleshooting guidelines.
6. Verification and Reporting:
◦ Verify the validity of the results.
◦ Transfer the validated results to the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
◦ Ensure results are reviewed and signed off by a qualified
technologist before releasing to the clinical team.
6. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Normal range for hs-TnI will be provided by the assay
manufacturer and should be verified during method validation by
the laboratory.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform routine quality control checks as specified by the
manufacturer and internal laboratory protocols.
• Maintain records of all QC results and any corrective actions
taken in the event of QC failures.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolyzed samples, lipemic samples, and those with high
bilirubin levels may interfere with hs-TnI measurement.
• Refer to the assay's product insert for specific details on possible
interfering substances and limitations.
