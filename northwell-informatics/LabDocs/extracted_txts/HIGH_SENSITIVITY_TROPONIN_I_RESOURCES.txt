Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): High Sensitivity Troponin
I (hs-TnI) Analysis
1. PURPOSE:
This SOP outlines the procedure for the analysis of High Sensitivity
Troponin I (hs-TnI) to ensure accurate and timely test results, which
are crucial for diagnosing myocardial infarction and other cardiac
events.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory personnel (laboratory technologists,
supervisors) are responsible for performing the assay, quality
control, calibration, and reporting of results.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring the procedure is
followed correctly.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS:
Specimen Type:
• Preferred: Serum or plasma (lithium heparin, EDTA)
Specimen Collection:
• Collect blood samples in a serum separator tube (SST) or
appropriate plasma collection tube according to standard
venipuncture technique.
• Ensure that specimens are properly labeled with patient
identification and collection time.
• Invert plasma tubes 8-10 times immediately after collection to
ensure proper mixing with anticoagulant. Allow serum tubes to
clot at room temperature before centrifugation.
Specimen Handling and Storage:
• Centrifuge specimens at 1500-2000g for 10 minutes at room
temperature within 1 hour of collection.
• Aliquot serum or plasma if not analyzed immediately.
• Refrigerate specimens at 2-8°C if analysis is delayed; for longer-
term storage freeze at -20°C or colder.
• Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
• Blood samples collected in sodium citrate tubes.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES:
• High Sensitivity Troponin I (hs-TnI) assay kits
• Calibrators and Controls
• Automated Immunoassay Analyzer
• Centrifuge
• SST or Plasma tubes (lithium heparin, EDTA)
• Pipettes and tips
• Gloves and Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
1. PROCEDURE:
A. Preparation:
1. Refer to the manufacturer’s insert for specific preparation
requirements.
2. Ensure that all reagents, calibrators, and controls are at room
temperature before use and have not expired.
3. Check that the analyzer is correctly set up, calibrated, and
quality control (QC) checks have been performed.
B. Calibration and Quality Control:
1. Perform calibration using calibrators provided by the
manufacturer following the analyzer’s instructions.
2. Run quality control samples at designated intervals (e.g.,
beginning of the day, after calibration, after maintenance).
3. Record the QC results and ensure they fall within the
acceptable range. If QC fails, do not proceed with testing,
investigate the cause, and repeat QC.
C. Sample Analysis:
1. Load patient specimens, calibrators, and controls onto the
analyzer according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Select the appropriate assay on the analyzer menu and start
the run.
3. Review the specimen results generated by the analyzer,
ensuring that the instruments and assay conditions meet
manufacturer specifications.
4. If hs-TnI levels are below the detection limit, report as "< LLOD
(Lower Limit of Detection)".
5. If the hs-TnI level is above the measurable range of the assay,
repeat the test on a diluted sample or report results according
to the dilution factor.
D. Troubleshooting:
1. If any error messages or flags appear on the analyzer, refer to
the user manual for troubleshooting steps.
2. Re-run the analysis if there is any indication of instrument
malfunction or sample quality issues remain unresolved.
3. QUALITY CONTROL:
• Evaluate all QC samples alongside patient samples to ensure the
analytical process is under control.
• Document all results and corrective actions when QC results fall
outside the specified limits.
• Perform proficiency testing as required to meet regulatory
compliance and laboratory accreditation standards.
1. REPORTING RESULTS:
• Review and verify all results before reporting.
• Record the hs-TnI result in the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
• Notify the appropriate healthcare provider immediately of any
critical values according to laboratory policy.
• Critical value threshold for hs-TnI: (Example: >52.0 ng/L, refer to
lab-specific critical value thresholds)
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS:
• Consult the assay kit insert for the manufacturer’s recommended
reference ranges or established laboratory reference ranges.
• Document and regularly review reference intervals and update
based on clinical correlation and population studies.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
• Refer to the manufacturer’s assay insert for limitations specific to
the hs-TnI assay, such as potential interferences, cross-reactivity,
or sample stability concerns.
1. DOCUMENTATION AND RECORD KEEPING:
• Maintain records of all calibrations, QC, test runs, and result
verifications following regulatory requirements and laboratory
policies.
• Properly document any deviations from standard procedures and
corrective actions taken.
