Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) High Sensitivity Troponin I
Series, Plasma
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the accurate and timely
analysis of high sensitivity Troponin I (hs-TnI) series in plasma
specimens. This SOP ensures that test results are reliable and meet
established quality standards.
Responsibility: It is the responsibility of laboratory personnel to follow
this procedure and document all results and observations accurately.
Supervisors are responsible for ensuring compliance with this SOP
and addressing any deficiencies or issues that arise.
1. SPECIMEN TYPE
Specimen: Plasma collected in a lithium heparin or K2-EDTA
anticoagulant tube.
• Preferred/acceptable: Plasma
• Volume: At least 1 mL of plasma is required.
• Storage: Store specimens at 2–8°C if analyzed within 24 hours;
otherwise, plasma may be frozen at -20°C for up to 2 weeks or at
-70°C for longer storage.
Unacceptable:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric specimens
• Specimens collected in sodium fluoride, sodium citrate, or any
other anticoagulant not specified above.
• Specimens stored at room temperature for more than 24 hours.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• High Sensitivity Troponin I assay kit (Vendor specific, e.g., Abbott
ARCHITECT hs-TnI)
• Automated immunoassay analyzer (e.g., Abbott ARCHITECT
i2000 SR)
• Calibrators and controls provided with hs-TnI assay kit
• Reagents and consumables as per assay-specific requirements
• Refrigerated centrifuge
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
1. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Processing:
1. Centrifuge collected blood specimens at 1,500 x g for 10
minutes to separate plasma.
2. Carefully pipette the plasma into labeled sample cups or tubes,
avoiding the buffy coat and red cell layer.
3. Store plasma samples at 2–8°C if analysis is to be performed
within 24 hours or freeze at -20°C or lower for longer storage.
B. Setting Up the Instrument:
1. Turn on the immunoassay analyzer and allow it to initialize
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Load reagents, calibrators, and controls onto the analyzer as
per the manufacturer’s guidelines.
3. Install appropriate assay-specific settings and parameters.
4. Perform system checks and calibration verification as required.
C. Running the Assay:
1. Enter patient and sample information into the Laboratory
Information System (LIS) or into the analyzer directly, as
applicable.
2. Load plasma samples onto the analyzer.
3. Assign samples to the hs-TnI assay.
4. Start the run and monitor for any alerts or errors during the
process.
D. Data Analysis and Reporting:
1. Once the run is complete, review the results for each sample.
2. Ensure quality control results are within acceptable limits before
accepting patient results.
3. Confirm that results for all patient samples are within the
analytical measurement range. If any result exceeds this range,
follow the manufacturer-provided instructions for appropriate
action, such as dilution and reanalysis.
4. Print and/or electronically transmit results from the analyzer to
the LIS.
E. Quality Control:
1. Quality control materials must be run at the beginning of each
shift, with each new reagent lot, and after any major
maintenance.
2. Analyze three levels of quality control material (low, normal,
high) to ensure the analyzer and reagents are performing
correctly.
3. Document all quality control results and take corrective action if
any control value is outside the specified range.
4. Any failure in quality control requires action and investigation,
including reviewing potential system errors, reagent issues, or
operator mistakes.
5. MAINTENANCE
Daily:
• Perform routine maintenance as specified by the manufacturer.
• Clean the exterior surfaces of the instrument.
Weekly:
• Inspect and clean any reusable components per the
manufacturer’s recommendations.
• Check reagent and consumable inventory.
Monthly:
• Perform a comprehensive check of all system components.
• Verify calibration settings and adjust as necessary.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING AND CORRECTIVE ACTIONS
2. If quality control results are out of range: a. Re-run the control.
b. If still out of range, prepare fresh control material and re-run.
c. Review reagent integrity and expiration dates. d. Contact
technical support if the problem persists.
3. If instrument errors occur: a. Refer to the manufacturer’s
troubleshooting guide. b. Log all errors and steps taken in the
instrument maintenance record. c. Inform the designated
supervisor.
