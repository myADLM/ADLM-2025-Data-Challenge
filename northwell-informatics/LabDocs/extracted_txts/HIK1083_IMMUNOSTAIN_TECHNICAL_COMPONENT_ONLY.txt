Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for HIK1083 Immunostain,
Technical Component Only
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedures for the analytical phase of generating
results using the HIK1083 immunostain, ensuring accurate and
consistent staining of appropriate tissue samples for diagnostic
purposes.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing
and documenting the staining process.
• Supervisors must ensure that staff are trained and competent in
performing the procedure and addressing any issues that may
arise during the process.
1. MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT
• HIK1083 Anti-Ki67 Primary Antibody
• Immunostaining kit (including secondary antibody, chromogen,
substrate, and counterstain)
• Slide racks and staining trays
• Automated or manual immunostaining system
• PBS (Phosphate Buffered Saline) solution
• Positive and negative control tissue slides
• Microscope
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation of Reagents and Equipment:
1. Validate and calibrate all equipment following the
manufacturer's guidelines.
2. Prepare the HIK1083 primary antibody, secondary antibody,
chromogen, and substrate as per the manufacturer's
instructions.
3. Verify the expiration dates and storage conditions of all
reagents to ensure they are within their use period.
B. Sample Preparation:
1. Ensure that tissue samples are properly fixed, embedded in
paraffin, and sectioned at a thickness of 4-5 micrometers.
2. Mount tissue sections onto positively charged slides and bake
in an oven at 60°C for 30 minutes to adhere the sections firmly.
C. Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
1. Deparaffinize slides by immersing them in three changes of
xylene for 5 minutes each.
2. Rehydrate slides through graded alcohol series (100%, 95%,
80%, 70%) for 3 minutes each.
3. Rinse slides in running tap water for 5 minutes.
D. Antigen Retrieval:
1. Perform antigen retrieval using a suitable method (e.g., heat-
induced epitope retrieval in a citrate buffer at pH 6.0 or TRIS-
EDTA buffer pH 9.0) by heating slides in a microwave, pressure
cooker, or water bath.
2. Allow slides to cool to room temperature for 20 minutes.
E. Blocking and Staining:
1. Block endogenous peroxidase activity by incubating slides in
3% hydrogen peroxide for 10 minutes.
2. Wash slides in PBS twice for 5 minutes each.
3. Apply a protein block (e.g., normal serum) and incubate for 10
minutes to prevent non-specific staining.
4. Apply HIK1083 Anti-Ki67 primary antibody to slides and
incubate for 30 minutes at room temperature.
5. Wash slides in PBS three times for 5 minutes each.
6. Apply the secondary antibody (e.g., biotinylated anti-mouse)
and incubate for 30 minutes.
7. Wash slides in PBS three times for 5 minutes each.
8. Apply DAB substrate/chromogen solution and incubate until the
desired staining intensity is achieved (usually 5-10 minutes).
9. Rinse slides in running tap water for 5 minutes.
F. Counterstaining and Mounting:
1. Counterstain slides with hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes.
2. Rinse slides in running tap water and differentiate in 0.25% acid
alcohol if necessary.
3. Blue the slides in running tap water for 5 minutes.
4. Dehydrate slides quickly through graded alcohol series (70%,
80%, 95%, and 100%) and clear in three changes of xylene.
5. Mount the slides with a permanent mounting medium and cover
with coverslips.
G. Quality Control:
1. Include positive and negative control slides with each batch of
staining.
2. Verify control slide staining before interpreting patient results.
3. Ensure that the positive control shows specific staining in the
expected cell types and that the negative control (omission of
primary antibody) shows no staining.
4. DOCUMENTATION AND RECORD-KEEPING
• Record the batch number and expiry date of all reagents used in
a logbook.
• Document the date, time, and initials of the personnel performing
the staining procedure.
• Record any deviations or issues encountered during the staining
process and the corrections made.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Quality control slides must be reviewed before reviewing patient
slides.
• Ensure that all slides are examined under the microscope, and
results are recorded per laboratory guidelines.
• Note: Only technical component results are generated;
interpretation and diagnosis are to be performed by the
pathologist.
