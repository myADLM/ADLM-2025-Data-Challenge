Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analysis of
Hippuric Acid in Urine
1. PURPOSE:
The purpose of this SOP is to define the procedural steps for
the analytical phase of generating results for hippuric acid in
urine specimens. This includes specimen handling, analysis,
quality control, and result reporting to ensure accurate and
reliable test outcomes.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND HANDLING:
◦ Preferred/Acceptable Specimen:
▪ 10 mL freshly collected midstream urine
▪ Specimens should be delivered to the laboratory within 2
hours of collection. If delayed, specimens should be
refrigerated at 2-8°C and analyzed within 24 hours.
◦ Unacceptable Specimens:
▪ Specimens arriving in the laboratory greater than 24
hours after collection if stored in the refrigerator, or
greater than 2 hours if stored at room temperature.
▪ Specimens arriving in the laboratory without collection
date/time indicated on the sample container or
requisition.
▪ Urine samples that are visibly contaminated or contain
particulate matter.
3. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS:
◦ HPLC (High-Performance Liquid Chromatography) system
equipped with UV detector
◦ HPLC column suitable for hippuric acid separation
◦ Mobile phase solvents (e.g., Acetonitrile, Phosphate Buffer)
◦ Hippuric Acid Standard Solution
◦ Internal Standard (if applicable)
◦ Calibration curve standards
◦ Control Urine Samples (Negative and Positive controls)
◦ Syringes and filtration units for sample preparation
◦ Centrifuge
4. PROCEDURE:
Sample Preparation:
1. Centrifuge Urine Sample:
▪ Centrifuge the urine sample at 3000 rpm for 10
minutes to remove particulate matter.
2. Filtration:
▪ Filter the supernatant through a 0.45 µm filter into a
clean vial.
3. Preparation for HPLC:
▪ Dilute the filtered urine sample (e.g., 1:10 dilution) with
distilled water or suitable diluent if required based on
calibration curve concentration range.
HPLC Analysis:
1. Instrument Setup:
▪ Set up the HPLC system according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
▪ Equilibrate the HPLC column with the mobile phase for
at least 30 minutes before running samples.
▪ Establish initial conditions based on the method
protocol (e.g., flow rate, gradient elution program).
2. Running Calibration Standards:
▪ Inject calibration standards and prepare a calibration
curve by plotting peak area/height against
concentration of hippuric acid standards.
3. Injection of Samples:
▪ Inject blank, control samples (negative and positive),
and patient urine samples sequentially.
▪ Ensure that each sample injection follows the
established sequence and record the sample IDs
accurately.
4. Data Collection:
▪ Run the samples through the HPLC system, collecting
chromatograms and peak data for hippuric acid.
▪ Quantify hippuric acid concentration in samples using
the prepared calibration curve.
5. QUALITY CONTROL:
◦ Quality Control Samples:
▪ Run internal quality control samples (both negative and
positive controls) with each batch of patient specimens.
▪ QC materials must be stored according to the
manufacturer guidelines and reconstituted as per
instructions.
◦ Acceptance Criteria:
▪ The retention time of hippuric acid in the patient samples
must match the retention time in the standards within
±2%.
▪ QC sample results must fall within the established
control limits. In case of QC failure, identify and resolve
the problem before proceeding with patient sample
analysis.
6. REPORTING RESULTS:
◦ Data Verification:
▪ Review peak integration and calculation for any errors.
▪ Compare results against reference intervals (Normal:
0.1-2.0 g/L) and establish if results are within expected
ranges.
◦ Result Entry:
▪ Enter the verified results into the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
▪ Flag any critical values for immediate notification to the
requesting physician (if applicable).
◦ Result Reporting:
▪ Generate a final report including patient ID, specimen ID,
analysis date, hippuric acid concentration, and reference
intervals. Release the report as per laboratory protocol
ensuring timely communication to clinicians.
7. REFERENCE INTERVALS:
◦ Normal: 0.1-2.0 g/L
8. TROUBLESHOOTING:
◦ Ensure HPLC system maintenance has been performed
routinely as per manufacturer’s recommendation.
◦ Verify mobile phase preparation, column calibration, and
instrument settings before starting the analysis.
◦ Utilize troubleshooting guidelines provided in the instrument
manual for resolving common issues related to retention
time shift, peak broadening, or signal noise.
