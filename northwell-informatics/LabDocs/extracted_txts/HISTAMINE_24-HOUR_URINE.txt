Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Histamine, 24-Hour Urine
1. PURPOSE
To provide guidelines for the accurate and efficient analysis of
histamine in 24-hour urine specimens, ensuring the consistency and
reliability of test results.
Responsibility:
• Designated staff are responsible for performing the analysis as
outlined in this SOP.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring that staff are trained and
proficient in this procedure.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred Specimen:
• 24-hour urine in a clean, tightly sealed urine container.
Specimen Collection:
• Patients should be instructed to collect all urine voided during a
24-hour period. The collection must start with an empty bladder.
The first voided urine is discarded, and all subsequent urine is
collected for the next 24 hours.
• The final collection should include the first void on the second day.
Specimen Storage:
• Store urine in a refrigerator or a cool environment during the
collection period and until transport to the laboratory.
• Aliquot the urine into an appropriate container and keep it
refrigerated if testing will not be performed immediately after
delivery to the lab.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens not collected over the full 24-hour period.
• Specimens that have not been stored properly during collection.
• Specimens presented in containers inappropriate for urine
collection.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Spectrophotometer or chromatography system (HPLC)
• Pipettes and tips
• Centrifuge
• Urine collection bottles
• Clean test tubes or sample cups
• Reagents for histamine analysis
• Deionized water
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
1. PROCEDURE
4.A. Pre-analytical Phase:
1. Verify patient identification and specimen labeling.
2. Ensure the completeness of the 24-hour collection by
confirming the start and end times.
3. Measure the total volume of urine collected and record the
volume.
4. Mix the urine well to ensure homogeneity before taking an
aliquot for testing.
5. Aliquot urine into a properly labeled test tube for analysis.
4.B. Analytical Phase:
1. Calibrate the spectrophotometer or HPLC system according to
the manufacturer's guidelines.
2. Prepare reagents and calibration standards as specified in the
reagent kit instructions.
3. Include appropriate quality control (QC) materials with each
batch of patient samples.
4. If using HPLC: a. Filter the urine sample through a 0.22-µm
filter before injection. b. Inject the sample and calibration
standards into the HPLC system. c. Analyze according to
system-specific parameters and monitor chromatograms for
retention times corresponding to histamine.
5. If using spectrophotometry: a. Mix aliquots of urine with the
specified reagent. b. Incubate the mixture at the specified
temperature and for the specified duration. c. Measure
absorbance at the specified wavelength.
6. Record the raw data and calculate the concentration of
histamine.
4.C. Post-analytical Phase:
1. Verify that QC results fall within the acceptable range. If not,
investigate and resolve before reporting patient results.
2. Calculate the total amount of histamine excreted over 24 hours
using the formula:
Total Histamine (µg/24 hours) = (Concentration in µg/mL) x
(Total volume in mL / 1000)
3. Enter results into the laboratory information system (LIS) for
reporting.
4. Verify and release results in LIS.
5. REPORTING RESULTS
6. Results are reported as micrograms per 24 hours (µg/24 hr).
7. Refer to site-specific reporting guidelines for critical values and
documentation procedures.
8. Include a comment on the completeness of the 24-hour
collection if applicable.
9. QUALITY CONTROL
10. Perform QC with each batch of specimens.
11. Use at least two levels of QC materials to monitor accuracy and
precision.
12. Document QC results and take corrective actions if QC results
are outside acceptable limits.
13. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Histamine, 24-Hour Urine:
◦ Reference interval: Refer to the specific laboratory’s
established reference ranges.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to the instrument and reagent package inserts for any
limitations related to the analytical method used for the histamine
assay.

Note: This SOP is to be reviewed periodically and updated as
necessary to ensure compliance with current standards and
protocols.
