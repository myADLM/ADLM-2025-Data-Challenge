Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Histamine Plasma Analytical Protocol
1. Purpose
To establish a standardized procedure for the analysis of histamine in
plasma specimens, ensuring accurate and reliable results for clinical
and research purposes.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for the proper
execution of the histamine plasma analysis, including ensuring
specimen integrity, proper use of equipment, and adherence to
quality control measures. Supervisors ensure staff are trained and
that all activities comply with this SOP.
2. Specimen Requirements
Preferred/Acceptable Specimen Type:
• Plasma collected in EDTA tubes.
• Specimens should be kept on ice and processed within 2 hours of
collection.
• Plasma must be separated by centrifugation at 4°C and stored at
-20°C or below until analysis.
Unacceptable Specimen Type:
• Specimens collected in tubes other than EDTA.
• Specimens exposed to room temperature for more than 2 hours.
• Specimens with hemolysis or improper labeling (missing date/time
of collection and patient identification).
3. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies
• High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system with
fluorometric detector
• EDTA tubes for blood collection
• Centrifuge capable of maintaining 4°C
• Ice pack for specimen transport
• Histamine standards and calibration solutions
• Mobile phase solvents
• Extraction reagents
4. Preparation and Calibration
Calibration:
• Prepare standard solutions of known histamine concentrations to
generate a calibration curve.
• Perform calibration before analyzing patient specimens.
• Standards should be run at the beginning and end of each batch
to ensure instrument accuracy.
Quality Control:
• Use quality control (QC) samples with known concentrations of
histamine to verify accuracy and precision.
• Perform QC checks at the beginning of each run and at regular
intervals throughout the analysis.
• Document all QC results and take corrective action if results fall
outside acceptable limits.
5. Analytical Procedure
A. Specimen Processing:
1. Transport plasma specimens on ice and centrifuge at 4°C to
separate plasma from cells within 2 hours of collection.
2. Aliquot plasma into labeled microcentrifuge tubes and store at
-20°C or lower until ready for analysis.
B. Extraction:
1. Thaw plasma specimens on ice.
2. Add extraction reagent to the plasma aliquot, vortex to mix, and
incubate as specified by the reagent manufacturer.
3. Perform a second centrifugation to remove particulate matter.
4. Collect the supernatant for HPLC analysis.
C. HPLC Analysis:
1. Set up the HPLC system according to the manufacturer’s
instructions, including column installation, mobile phase
preparation, and detector settings.
2. Inject calibration standards and QC samples to verify system
performance.
3. Inject 20 µL of sample supernatant into the HPLC system for
analysis.
4. Monitor the chromatogram for histamine peak detection and
quantification.
5. Record histamine concentration based on the calibration curve.
6. Reporting Results
• Ensure all results are reviewed and verified by the technologist
before reporting.
• Transfer verified results to the Laboratory Information System
(LIS) for integration into patient medical records.
• Flag and promptly communicate critical values to the ordering
physician according to the laboratory's critical results policy.
7. Reference Intervals
Normal range for histamine:
• Adults: 0 - 10 ng/mL
• Pediatric: Reference ranges may vary; consult age-specific
reference norms.
8. Method Limitations
Refer to HPLC system and reagent manufacturers’ inserts for specific
limitations of the histamine analytical method. Possible interferences
include other biogenic amines, improper specimen handling, and
instrument malfunction.
9. Documentation
• Maintain records of all calibrations, quality control checks, and
patient results according to the laboratory’s documentation policy.
• Ensure all corrective actions are documented and reviewed
periodically for continuous improvement.

11. Review and Updates
This SOP should be reviewed annually and whenever there is a
change in equipment, reagents, or method specifications. Updates
should be documented and approved by laboratory management.
