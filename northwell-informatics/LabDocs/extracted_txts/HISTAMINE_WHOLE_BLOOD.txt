Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Histamine Results from Whole Blood Specimens
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to outline the steps and
responsibilities for the analytical phase of generating histamine
results from whole blood specimens in the laboratory. Proper
adherence to this procedure ensures accuracy, reproducibility, and
reliability of test results.
1. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel involved in the
analytical phase of generating histamine results from whole blood
specimens.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
• Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the
assays, recording data, and reviewing results.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring that laboratory
personnel are trained in this procedure and that the procedure is
followed accurately.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred Specimen: Whole blood collected in an EDTA tube. •
Volume: Minimum 2.0 mL of whole blood. • Stability: Whole blood
samples should be kept at 4°C and tested within 48 hours of
collection.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Refrigerated centrifuge • Histamine assay kit (e.g., Immunoassay,
ELISA) • Pipettes and tips • Vortex mixer • Automated or manual
microplate reader • Calibrated traceable laboratory thermometers •
Personal protective equipment (PPE)
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparations and Precautions
1. Wear appropriate PPE, including lab coat, gloves, and safety
glasses.
2. Ensure the laboratory workspace is clean and organized.
3. Allow reagents and samples to come to room temperature
before starting the assay.
4. Calibrate all required instruments according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
B. Sample Preparation
1. Whole blood samples should be stored at 4°C until analysis.
2. If necessary, gently mix the whole blood sample by inverting the
collection tube several times.
C. Assay Procedure
1. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for the histamine assay
kit.
2. Vortex the whole blood sample for 5 seconds.
3. Aliquot the required volume of whole blood into the assay plate
or tubes as specified by the kit instructions.
4. Prepare and add reagents according to the kit protocol,
including standards and controls.
5. Incubate the samples for the specified time and conditions as
per the manufacturer’s instructions.
6. Read and record the results using an automated or manual
microplate reader and follow the reading instructions provided
by the manufacturer.
D. Quality Control
1. Perform quality control checks with each assay run using
provided control materials to ensure the accuracy and reliability
of the test results.
2. Document all quality control data in the laboratory information
system (LIS).
3. RESULT ANALYSIS AND INTERPRETATION
• Analyze the data against the standard curve generated by the
known histamine standards. • Interpret the results according to the
reference ranges and cut-offs provided in the kit insert.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If control values are out of the acceptable range, do not proceed
with sample analysis. Identify potential sources of error, recalibrate
the equipment, and repeat the assay. • Document any
troubleshooting activities and corrective actions taken in the
laboratory logbook.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Enter and validate the histamine results in the laboratory
information system (LIS) as per site-specific guidelines. • Notify the
requesting physician or healthcare provider of any critical or urgent
results.
1. DOCUMENTATION AND RECORD KEEPING
• All data, including calibration records, quality control results, and
patient test results, must be recorded and maintained as per
laboratory policy. • Ensure that all necessary documentation is
complete, accurate, and filed appropriately.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions for the histamine assay kit. • Laboratory
information system (LIS) user manual. • Relevant clinical laboratory
standards and guidelines.
1. REVIEW
This SOP is to be reviewed annually or as needed based on new
requirements or updates in laboratory practices.
