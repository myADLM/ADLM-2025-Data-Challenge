Standard Operating Procedure for HISTONE 3.3 G34W (H3F3A
G34W) Immunostain, Technical Component Only
1. PURPOSE
To outline the technical procedure for the immunohistochemical
staining of HISTONE 3.3 G34W (H3F3A G34W) in tissue specimens
to ensure standardized, accurate, and reproducible results.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of trained laboratory personnel to perform and
document this staining procedure following the outlined steps.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
◦ Acceptable Specimens: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded
(FFPE) tissue blocks.
◦ Unacceptable Specimens: Non-FFPE tissue, inadequately
fixed specimens, and specimens that are over-fixed.
2. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
◦ Equipment:
▪ Microtome
▪ Water bath
▪ Automated immunostainer or manual staining setup
▪ Slide drying oven
▪ Microscope for evaluation
◦ Reagents:
▪ HISTONE 3.3 G34W (H3F3A G34W) primary antibody
▪ Detection system (secondary antibody, linking reagent,
chromogen)
▪ Positive and negative control slides
▪ Xylene
▪ Graded alcohols (70%, 80%, 95%, and 100%)
▪ Distilled water
▪ Antigen retrieval solution (e.g., citrate buffer)
▪ Hematoxylin for counterstaining
▪ Mounting medium
◦ Supplies:
▪ Glass slides
▪ Cover slips
▪ ImmEdge (hydrophobic barrier pen)
3. PROCEDURE
A) Slide Preparation:
1. Cut 4-micron sections from the FFPE blocks using a
microtome.
2. Float the sections on a 40-45°C water bath to flatten, then
mount them onto positively charged glass slides.
3. Allow the slides to dry at room temperature for at least 10
minutes.
4. Bake the slides in a slide drying oven at 60°C for 30-60
minutes.
B) Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
1. Deparaffinize slides in three changes of xylene, 5 minutes each.
2. Rehydrate through a series of graded alcohols: 100% - 2 x 5
minutes, 95% - 1 x 5 minutes, 80% - 1 x 2 minutes, 70% - 1 x 2
minutes.
3. Rinse in distilled water for 2 minutes.
C) Antigen Retrieval:
1. Immerse slides in antigen retrieval solution (e.g., citrate buffer)
and perform heat-induced epitope retrieval (HIER) using a
microwave, pressure cooker, or water bath according to the
manufacturer’s instructions, typically for 20 minutes.
2. Allow slides to cool for 20 minutes at room temperature.
3. Rinse in distilled water for 2 minutes.
D) Blocking and Primary Antibody Incubation:
1. Use a hydrophobic barrier pen to circle the tissue sections on
the slides.
2. Apply a blocking solution (e.g., serum-free protein block) to the
sections and incubate for 10 minutes at room temperature to
minimize non-specific binding.
3. Drain the blocking solution without rinsing.
4. Apply the primary antibody specific for HISTONE 3.3 G34W
(H3F3A G34W) to the sections. Incubate according to the
antibody manufacturer's instructions, typically for 30-60 minutes
at room temperature.
5. Rinse slides in buffer solution (e.g., PBS) three times, for 2
minutes each.
E) Detection and Chromogen Application:
1. Apply the secondary antibody and/or linking reagent provided
by the detection system kit. Incubate as per the manufacturer’s
instructions, typically for 15-30 minutes.
2. Rinse slides in buffer solution three times, for 2 minutes each.
3. Apply the chromogen and visualize under a microscope for
color development. Incubation times vary by chromogen,
typically 5-15 minutes.
4. Rinse slides in distilled water.
F) Counterstaining, Dehydration, and Mounting:
1. Counterstain with hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes.
2. Rinse slides in tap water until clear.
3. Dehydrate through graded alcohols (70%, 80%, 95%, and
100%), 2 minutes each.
4. Clear in xylene, 2 x 5 minutes.
5. Apply a coverslip with a mounting medium.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
7. Always include positive and negative control slides with each
batch processed.
8. Document the staining process, including antibody lot numbers,
incubation times, and visual checks of control slides.
9. Review control slides microscopically to verify proper staining
before evaluating patient specimens.
10. Record any deviations or troubleshooting steps taken during
the procedure.
11. REPORTING RESULTS
12. Technical component results should be reviewed by a
pathologist or qualified laboratory personnel.
13. Ensure results are documented in the laboratory information
system (LIS) and appropriately labeled with the tissue block,
patient identifier, and staining details.
14. Pathologists should evaluate the staining specificity and
intensity before final diagnostic interpretation.
15. REFERENCE MATERIALS
Follow manufacturer’s guidelines and package inserts for the primary
antibody and detection system. Regularly review literature for
updates on immunostaining protocols and quality control best
practices.
