Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) HISTONE GENES
MUTATION ANALYSIS, NEXT-GENERATION SEQUENCING,
TUMOR
1. PURPOSE
To provide guidelines for conducting and documenting the process of
histone gene mutation analysis in tumor samples using next-
generation sequencing (NGS).
Responsibility:
All designated laboratory staff must ensure proper handling,
processing, and analysis of the tumor samples for histone gene
mutations according to this SOP. It is the joint responsibility of
laboratory technicians, technologists, and supervisors to follow these
protocols accurately and report any anomalies to the appropriate
individuals.
2. DEFINITION
Histone genes mutation analysis involves identifying mutations in
histone genes, which can be critical in tumorigenesis. The process
uses next-generation sequencing technology to detect these
mutations within tumor DNA.
3. PROCEDURE
3.1. Equipment and Reagents Preparation
Equipment:
• NGS platform (e.g., Illumina HiSeq/MiSeq/NextSeq)
• PCR thermocycler
• DNA quantification instruments (e.g., Qubit Fluorometer)
• Microcentrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Pipettes and filtered tips
• Thermal cycler for library preparation
• Bioinformatics workstation
Reagents:
• DNA extraction kit
• Library preparation kit specific for NGS
• Target enrichment probes for histone genes
• PCR reagents, including primers and nucleotides
• Purification beads (e.g., AMPure XP)
• Quantification reagents for DNA quality assessment
3.2. Specimen Requirements
Tumor Sample:
• Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue or fresh frozen
tissue from a biopsy or surgical resection.
• Ensure all specimens are labeled correctly with unique identifiers.
Acceptable Specimen Criteria:
• Adequate DNA concentration and quality: Minimum concentration
of 50 ng/µL and purity (A260/280 ratio) of 1.8-2.0.
• Specimens without visible contamination or degradation.
3.3. DNA Extraction
1. Perform DNA extraction from the tumor sample using a
commercially available kit according to the manufacturer's
protocol.
2. Quantify and assess the quality of the extracted DNA using
Qubit Fluorometer and NanoDrop spectrophotometry.
3. Document the DNA concentration and quality metrics in the
Specimen Log.
3.4. Library Preparation and Target Enrichment
1. Input DNA: Use 50-200 ng of DNA for library preparation.
2. Follow the library preparation protocol provided by the kit
manufacturer, ensuring proper fragmentation, end-repair, and
adaptor ligation steps.
3. Perform target enrichment using probes specific for histone
genes, according to the enrichment kit protocol.
4. PCR Amplification: Perform PCR amplification to enrich the
library further.
5. Purify the amplified library using purification beads.
6. Assess the library quality and quantify it using Bioanalyzer or
TapeStation.
3.5. Sequencing
1. Load the prepared library onto the NGS platform following the
instrument-specific loading and run setup protocols.
2. Ensure the run parameters are correctly set for the sequencing
depth required for histone gene mutation analysis.
3. Monitor the sequencing run to ensure it progresses without
errors.
3.6. Data Analysis
1. Transfer raw sequencing data to the bioinformatics workstation.
2. Use bioinformatics pipelines to process the raw data, including
alignment to reference genome, variant calling, and annotation.
3. Identify mutations in histone genes using analysis software.
4. Perform manual review of detected variants to ensure accuracy.
5. Document all identified mutations and relevant metrics in the
Result Log.
3.7. Quality Control
1. Include positive and negative controls throughout the
extraction, library preparation, and sequencing processes.
2. Analyze control results to ensure proper workflow performance.
3. Perform inter-laboratory comparison tests periodically to
validate the accuracy of the mutation detection protocol.
3.8. Reporting Results
1. Review and verify sequencing and mutation analysis results.
2. Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
3. Generate a comprehensive report, including identified
mutations, raw data quality metrics, and interpretation.
4. Ensure results are double-checked for consistency and
accuracy before releasing them to the requesting physician or
clinician.

5. NOTES
All personnel must be adequately trained in handling specimens,
library preparation, sequencing, and data interpretation. Any
deviations from the standard procedure must be documented, and
corrective actions must be reviewed and approved by laboratory
supervisors.
