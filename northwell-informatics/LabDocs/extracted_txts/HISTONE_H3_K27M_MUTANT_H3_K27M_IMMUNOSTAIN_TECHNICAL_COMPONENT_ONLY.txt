Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Title: Analytical Procedure for
Generating Results for Histone H3 K27M Mutant (H3 K27M)
Immunostain, Technical Component Only
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this SOP is to outline the analytical
procedures involved in generating results for the Histone H3
K27M Mutant (H3 K27M) immunostain test. This SOP is aimed
at ensuring consistent, accurate, and reliable results for
diagnostic purposes.
2. SCOPE This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel trained in
immunohistochemical staining and analysis, dealing specifically
with the H3 K27M immunostain in the Histology Department.
The specimen has already been collected, received, and
accessioned according to laboratory protocols.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Designated laboratory technologists are responsible for
performing the immunostaining procedure, documenting all
relevant information, and ensuring the quality control of the test.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring that all laboratory
technologists are trained adequately and adhere to this SOP.
1. MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT
• Histology slides with formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE)
tissue sections
• Histone H3 K27M primary antibody
• Secondary antibody (species-specific)
• Detection system (e.g., DAB chromogen)
• Hematoxylin counterstain
• Xylene, ethanol, and mounting medium
• Automated or manual immunostaining equipment
• Positive and negative control slides
• Micropipettes and tips
• Humidity chamber (if using manual staining)
• Incubators at 37°C
• Microscopes
1. SAFETY PRECAUTION
• Follow universal precautions to handle biological specimens.
• Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) including
gloves, lab coat, and safety goggles.
• Handle hazardous chemicals such as xylene and DAB
chromogen under appropriate fume hoods.
1. PROCEDURE 6.1 Pre-Staining Preparation a. Ensure the
workspace and equipment are appropriately cleaned and
prepared. b. Label all slides clearly with the patient identifiers
and other relevant information. c. Select positive and negative
control slides to verify the staining process.
6.2 Deparaffinization and Rehydration a. Incubate slides in xylene for
2-3 minutes, 3 changes. b. Rehydrate in a series of graded ethanol
solutions (100%, 95%, 70%) 2 minutes each, followed by a brief rinse
in distilled water.
6.3 Antigen Retrieval a. Preheat antigen retrieval solution in a water
bath or microwave. b. Immerse slides in the preheated antigen
retrieval solution. c. Perform heat-induced antigen retrieval by
heating at 95°C for 20-40 minutes depending on the antibody
manufacturer’s recommendations. d. Allow slides to cool at room
temperature for 20 minutes and rinse in distilled water.
6.4 Immunostaining a. Apply the primary antibody (Histone H3 K27M)
to the tissue sections and incubate according to manufacturer’s
instructions, typically 1 hour at room temperature in a humidity
chamber. b. Rinse slides in PBS or TBS buffer. c. Apply the
appropriate secondary antibody and incubate for 30 minutes at room
temperature. d. Rinse slides in PBS or TBS buffer. e. Apply the
chromogen (e.g., DAB), incubate until the desired stain intensity is
achieved, typically 5-10 minutes. f. Rinse slides in distilled water to
stop the reaction. g. Counterstain slides with hematoxylin for 1-2
minutes, rinse in water. h. Dehydrate through graded ethanol
solutions (70%, 95%, 100%) and clear in xylene.
6.5 Mounting and Covering a. Place slides in a drying rack and allow
to dry completely. b. Apply mounting medium and cover with a
coverslip.
6.6 Quality Control a. Review positive and negative control slides to
validate the staining process. b. Document any issues or deviations
encountered during the staining procedure. c. Ensure all staining
results meet quality standards before reporting.
1. INTERPRETATION AND REPORT
• The pathologist will interpret the stain by evaluating the intensity
and distribution of the staining.
• Positive staining for H3 K27M mutant will be indicative based on
the specific criteria established.
• Report the results in accordance with the laboratory’s reporting
guidelines.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s guidelines for Histone H3 K27M antibodies.
• Laboratory’s Quality Control and Operations Manual.
• Relevant literature and standard texts on immunohistochemistry
protocols.
1. DOCUMENTATION
• All steps and observations must be documented in the
laboratory’s LIMS (Laboratory Information Management System).
• Deviations from the standard protocol should be recorded and
reviewed by the supervisor.
Standard Operating Procedures compliance is mandatory for
ensuring the quality and reliability of laboratory analytical processes.
Failure to adhere to these procedures may result in inaccurate results
and compromised patient care.
