STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE
Title: Histone H3 K36M Mutant (H3F3 K36M) Immunostain,
Technical Component Only
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the procedure for performing the technical
component of Histone H3 K36M Mutant (H3F3 K36M)
immunostaining. This will involve the preparation of slides, staining
process using the specific antibody, and quality control measures to
ensure accurate and consistent results.
2. SCOPE
This procedure is applicable to all technical staff in the histopathology
laboratory responsible for performing immunohistochemical staining
for the Histone H3 K36M Mutant (H3F3 K36M).
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of trained laboratory technologists to perform all
steps of this procedure accurately and consistently. The laboratory
supervisor and pathologist will ensure that the SOP is followed and
provide oversight for quality control.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue
sections Slide Preparation: 4-5 μm thick tissue sections mounted on
charged slides
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Microtome
• Water bath
• Drying oven
• Immunostaining workstation (automated or manual)
• Primary Antibody: Anti-H3 K36M (H3F3 K36M)
• Detection kit: Suitable for use with primary antibody
• Positive and negative control slides
• Cover slips and mounting medium
6. PROCEDURE
6.1 Slide Preparation
1. Sectioning:
◦ Cut 4-5 μm thick sections from the FFPE tissue block using
a microtome.
◦ Float sections on a 37°C water bath.
◦ Transfer sections onto charged slides.
2. Drying:
◦ Place slides in a drying oven at 60°C for at least 1 hour to
ensure proper adhesion to the slides.
6.2 Immunostaining Process
1. Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
◦ Deparaffinize slides by soaking in three changes of xylene
for 5 minutes each.
◦ Rehydrate slides through a series of graded alcohols
(100%, 95%, 70%) and rinse with distilled water.
2. Antigen Retrieval:
◦ Perform heat-induced epitope retrieval using citrate buffer
(pH 6.0) or EDTA buffer (pH 8.0).
◦ Heat slides in a microwave or pressure cooker according to
the specific protocol for the buffer being used.
3. Blocking:
◦ Incubate slides with a protein blocking solution (e.g., normal
serum) to reduce non-specific binding, typically for 10
minutes at room temperature.
4. Primary Antibody Incubation:
◦ Incubate slides with the primary Anti-H3 K36M (H3F3 K36M)
antibody at the recommended dilution and incubation time
(typically overnight at 4°C).
5. Washing:
◦ Wash slides in PBS or TBS buffer to remove unbound
primary antibody.
6. Secondary Antibody and Detection:
◦ Incubate slides with an appropriate secondary antibody
conjugated to an enzyme (e.g., HRP) for the recommended
time period.
◦ Develop slides using a chromogen/substrate solution until
the desired staining intensity is achieved.
7. Counterstaining:
◦ Counterstain with hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes and rinse with
distilled water.
◦ Blue the slides in ammonia water or Scott’s tap water
substitute.
8. Dehydration and Mounting:
◦ Dehydrate by passing slides through graded alcohols (70%,
95%, 100%) and clear in xylene.
◦ Mount coverslip with a permanent mounting medium.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include positive and negative control slides with each batch of
patient specimens.
• Evaluate control slides to ensure staining procedure was
successful.
• Document any deviations from the protocol and corrective actions
taken.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Following staining, slides will be examined by a pathologist for
interpretation.
• Technical staff will document the completion of staining in the
laboratory information system (LIS).
• Ensure that all slides are properly labeled and stored.
9. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s guidelines for Anti-H3 K36M (H3F3 K36M)
antibody and detection kits.
• Laboratory safety and quality control procedures manuals.
• Relevant histopathology and immunohistochemistry textbooks
and articles.
10. REVIEW AND APPROVAL
The SOP will be reviewed and approved annually or as necessary by
the laboratory supervisor and pathologist.
