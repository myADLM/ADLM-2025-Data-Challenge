STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP)
HISTONE H3 TRIMETHYL K27 IMMUNOSTAIN, TECHNICAL
COMPONENT ONLY
1. PURPOSE
This procedure outlines the specific steps required to perform the
Histone H3 Trimethyl K27 immunostain. This protocol ensures the
accurate and consistent preparation and staining of histological slides
to detect trimethylation at lysine 27 on histone H3.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory technologists are responsible for performing
and documenting each step of the procedure. Supervisors are
responsible for ensuring the procedure is followed and for addressing
any issues that arise.
3. SPECIMENS
Acceptable Specimens:
• Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks.
• Unstained sections on positively charged glass slides.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Tissue that is inadequately fixed.
• Damaged or broken slides.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Microtome
• Water bath
• Oven or slide warming tray
• Pressure cooker or steamer
• Humidity chamber
Reagents:
• Xylene
• Ethanol (100%, 95%, 70%)
• Distilled water
• Antigen retrieval buffer (e.g., Citrate Buffer, pH 6.0)
• Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)
• Blocking serum (e.g., 5% normal goat serum)
• Primary antibody against Histone H3 trimethyl K27
• Secondary antibody conjugated with an enzyme (e.g., HRP)
• Substrate-chromogen solution (e.g., DAB)
• Hematoxylin counterstain
• Mounting medium
Supplies:
• Glass slides
• Cover glasses
• Immunostaining trays
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Timer
5. PROCEDURE
A. Slide Preparation:
1. Sectioning:
◦ Cut 4-5 µm sections from FFPE tissue blocks using a
microtome.
◦ Float sections on a water bath and mount on positively
charged glass slides.
◦ Dry slides in an oven or on a slide warming tray at 60°C for
1 hour.
B. Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
1. Place slides in a staining rack.
2. Deparaffinize in xylene for 2 x 10 minutes.
3. Hydrate through graded alcohols:
◦ 100% ethanol, 2 x 5 minutes.
◦ 95% ethanol, 1 x 5 minutes.
◦ 70% ethanol, 1 x 5 minutes.
4. Rinse slides in distilled water for 5 minutes.
C. Antigen Retrieval:
1. Prepare antigen retrieval buffer (e.g., citrate buffer, pH 6.0).
2. Heat slides in retrieval solution using a pressure cooker or
steamer for 20 minutes.
3. Allow slides to cool in the buffer for 20 minutes at room
temperature.
4. Wash slides in PBS for 3 x 5 minutes.
D. Blocking:
1. Incubate slides in blocking serum for 10 minutes to reduce non-
specific binding.
2. Blot off excess serum without washing.
E. Primary Antibody Incubation:
1. Dilute the primary antibody as per the manufacturer's
instructions in PBS.
2. Apply primary antibody to each slide and incubate in a humid
chamber for 1 hour at room temperature.
3. Wash slides in PBS for 3 x 5 minutes.
F. Secondary Antibody Incubation:
1. Apply secondary antibody conjugated with HRP to each slide
and incubate for 30 minutes in a humid chamber.
2. Wash slides in PBS for 3 x 5 minutes.
G. Chromogen Development:
1. Prepare the substrate-chromogen solution (e.g., DAB)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Apply the substrate-chromogen solution to each slide and
incubate for 5-10 minutes or until desired staining intensity is
achieved.
3. Rinse slides in distilled water.
H. Counterstaining:
1. Counterstain slides with hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes.
2. Wash slides in running tap water for 5 minutes to blue the
hematoxylin.
I. Dehydration, Clearing, and Mounting:
1. Dehydrate slides through graded alcohols:
◦ 70% ethanol, 1 x 1 minute.
◦ 95% ethanol, 1 x 1 minute.
◦ 100% ethanol, 2 x 1 minute.
2. Clear slides in xylene for 2 x 3 minutes.
3. Mount slides with a coverslip using a suitable mounting
medium.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Include a positive control slide with known Histone H3 Trimethyl
K27 expression.
2. Include a negative control slide omitting the primary antibody.
3. Document all staining runs, including any deviations and
troubleshooting.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Stained slides are reviewed by a pathologist for interpretation.
2. Technical staff should ensure that all stains are of appropriate
quality before submission to the pathologist.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
1. The quality of staining may vary with the age and fixation state
of tissue specimens.
2. Over-retrieval or under-retrieval of antigens can affect staining
intensity.
