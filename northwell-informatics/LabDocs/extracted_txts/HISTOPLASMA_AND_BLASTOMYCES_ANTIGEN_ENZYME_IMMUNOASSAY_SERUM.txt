Standard Operating Protocol (SOP) for HISTOPLASMA AND
BLASTOMYCES ANTIGEN, ENZYME IMMUNOASSAY, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the procedures for the analysis of Histoplasma and
Blastomyces antigens in serum samples using the Enzyme
Immunoassay (EIA) method. The accurate detection of these
antigens is essential for diagnosing infections caused by Histoplasma
capsulatum and Blastomyces dermatitidis.
1. SCOPE
This procedure is applicable to the laboratory personnel trained in
performing the Histoplasma and Blastomyces antigen EIA tests within
the laboratory.
1. RESPONSIBILITIES
• Laboratory staff are responsible for following this SOP and
ensuring accurate and precise results.
• Supervisors are responsible for reviewing and verifying the results
and maintaining the quality control of the tests.
• Designated staff are responsible for monitoring the equipment and
ensuring it is functioning properly.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• EIA Reader (e.g., microplate reader)
• EIA reagents and kits specific for Histoplasma and Blastomyces
antigen detection
• Microplates, pipettes, and tips
• Calibrated micropipettes (20-200 µL, 200-1000 µL)
• Incubators (37°C and room temperature)
• Positive and negative control sera
• Washer (manual or automatic for microplates)
• Distilled or deionized water
1. PROCEDURE
Specimen Preparation
◦ Ensure specimen is serum obtained through standard blood
collection procedures.
◦ Centrifuge at room temperature to separate serum (3000 x
g, 10 minutes).
◦ Store serum at 2-8°C if not analyzed immediately, stable up
to 48 hours. For long-term storage, freeze at -20°C or below.
Reagent Preparation
◦ Follow manufacturer instructions to prepare and bring all
reagents and samples to room temperature.
◦ Reconstitute reagents, calibrators, and controls as per
reagent kit instructions.
Assay Procedure
◦ Step 1: Label microplate wells for standards, controls, and
samples.
◦ Step 2: Pipette 100 µL of standards, controls, and patient
samples into appropriate wells.
◦ Step 3: Add 100 µL of conjugate solution to each well.
◦ Step 4: Incubate the plate at 37°C for 1 hour.
◦ Step 5: Wash the wells 3 times with 300 µL of wash buffer;
remove residual liquid by inverting the plate and blotting on
paper towels.
◦ Step 6: Add 100 µL of TMB substrate to each well.
◦ Step 7: Incubate at room temperature (18-25°C) for 30
minutes in the dark.
◦ Step 8: Add 100 µL of stop solution to each well to terminate
the reaction.
◦ Step 9: Read the absorbance at 450 nm within 30 minutes
of adding the stop solution.
2. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run positive and negative controls in each assay to ensure assay
performance and result validity.
• Include kit control results in result interpretation.
• Repeat any test with control values outside the expected range.
• Record control results in the laboratory’s quality control log.
1. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
• Analyze the results using the microplate reader software.
• Calculate the mean absorbance for each set of duplicate
standards, controls, and samples.
• Generate a standard curve to determine the antigen concentration
in the patient samples.
• Report the results in units/mL based on the calibration curve.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Enter results into the laboratory information system (LIS).
• Flag results that fall outside the established reference range.
• Notify the physician immediately if critical values (positive results)
are detected.
• Interpret the results in conjunction with clinical findings and other
laboratory results.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Histoplasma Antigen: Negative (below the cut-off value)
• Blastomyces Antigen: Negative (below the cut-off value)
1. LIMITATIONS
• The test should be used as an aid to diagnosis in conjunction with
clinical observations and other diagnostic procedures.
• False positives or negatives may occur due to cross-reactivity or
assay interference.
• Follow the manufacturer's insert for specific limitations associated
with the reagents and protocol.
