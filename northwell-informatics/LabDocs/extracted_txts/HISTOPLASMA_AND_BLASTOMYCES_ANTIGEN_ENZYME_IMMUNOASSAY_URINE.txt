Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for HISTOPLASMA AND
BLASTOMYCES ANTIGEN, ENZYME IMMUNOASSAY, URINE
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to outline the steps required for the
analytical phase of generating results for Histoplasma and
Blastomyces antigen detection using enzyme immunoassay (EIA) in
urine specimens.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory staff to perform this
procedure accurately following the outlined steps. The staff must
ensure that all quality control measures are adhered to and that any
issues are promptly reported to the supervisor.
2. SPECIMEN
Acceptable Specimen:
• Preferred: 10 mL freshly voided urine sent to the laboratory within
6 hours of collection.
• Acceptable: 5-10 mL urine collected in BD Vacutainer Urinalysis
Preservative Conical Urine tube. Specimens in these tubes are
stable for up to 72 hours at 4-25°C with an ideal volume of 7-9 ml.
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Specimens arriving in the laboratory greater than 6 hours after
collection (for BD vacutainer tubes, specimens arriving in the
laboratory greater than 72 hours after collection).
• Specimens arriving in the laboratory that have no collection date/
time indicated on the sample container or requisition.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• EIA Plate Reader
• Multichannel Pipette
• Incubator
• Washing System (manual or automated plate washer)
Reagents:
• Histoplasma and Blastomyces antigen test kits (enzyme
immunoassay kits)
• Calibrators and Controls
• Wash Buffer
• Substrate Solution
• Stop Solution
Supplies:
• Microtiter plates
• Pipette tips
• Laboratory consumables
4. PROCEDURE
A. PREPARATION
1. Check the expiration date on all reagents and kits before use.
2. Allow all reagents to reach room temperature before starting
the assay.
3. Label the microtiter plate properly according to the sample
layout.
B. SAMPLE PROCESSING
1. Vortex urine samples briefly to ensure thorough mixing.
2. Pipette the required volume (typically 100 µL) of standards,
controls, and urine samples into the appropriate wells on the
microtiter plate.
3. Add the incubation solution to each well according to the kit
insert instructions.
4. Incubate the plate at the specified temperature and duration
(refer to kit manual).
5. After incubation, wash the plate using the wash buffer as per
the kit instructions (typically 3-5 washes).
C. DETECTION
1. Add the enzyme conjugate (detection antibody) to each well
and incubate again as per the kit instructions.
2. Wash the plate thoroughly post-incubation.
3. Add the substrate solution to each well. Incubate for the
recommended time until adequate color development.
4. Add stop solution to each well to terminate the reaction.
5. Read the plate using the microtiter plate reader at the specified
wavelength (typically 450 nm).
D. QUALITY CONTROL
Perform quality control checks with each run using designated
positive and negative controls. Ensure that control results fall within
the established range. Document any deviations and corrective
actions.
E. RESULTS INTERPRETATION
1. Compare absorbance readings of samples to standards and
controls using the curve generated by the known
concentrations.
2. Record antigen levels as per the reference ranges provided in
the kit insert.
F. REPORTING RESULTS
All results must be reviewed and validated by the technologist before
reporting. Results should be entered into the laboratory information
system (LIS).
6. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to kit insert for any specific method limitations, interferences, or
significant factors that may affect performance or results.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
Internal Quality Control: Two levels of quality control (negative and
positive) should be included in every test run to ensure assay
performance.
External Quality Control: Participate in proficiency testing programs
when available to verify accuracy of the laboratory results.
8. REFERENCES
Refer to the manufacturers' kit insert and any pertinent analytical
method publications for detailed information and guidance.
9. DOCUMENTATION
Log all procedures, observations, and results, including QC and
corrective actions, in the relevant lab records.
This SOP must be reviewed periodically to ensure compliance with
current standards and regulations.
