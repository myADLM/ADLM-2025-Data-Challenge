Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Title: Histoplasma Antibody
Complement Fixation and Immunodiffusion, Serum
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedures for the detection and quantitation of
antibodies against Histoplasma capsulatum in serum samples using
Complement Fixation (CF) and Immunodiffusion (ID) methods.
1. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel performing the analytical
phase of Histoplasma antibody testing in the CLIA-certified
laboratory.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all laboratory personnel to follow this SOP as
instructed to ensure accurate and reproducible results. Supervisors
are responsible for ensuring that all staff are trained and competent in
these procedures.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND HANDLING
◦ Specimen type: Serum
◦ Volume required: Minimum of 2 mL of serum
◦ Specimen storage: Store serum samples at 2-8°C if tested
within 48 hours; otherwise, store at -20°C or lower.
◦ Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
Unacceptable specimens:
• Specimens with severe hemolysis or lipemia.
• Specimens not labeled or without a requisition form.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
◦ Complement Fixation Reagents
◦ Immunodiffusion Agar Plates
◦ Histoplasma Antigen (for both CF and ID methods)
◦ Positive and Negative Control Sera
◦ Incubator (37°C)
◦ Water bath (56°C)
◦ Micropipettes and tips
◦ Test tubes and racks
◦ Timer
◦ Laboratory documentation forms and logbooks
2. PROCEDURE
A. Complement Fixation (CF) Method:
1. Preparation: a. Thaw serum samples, positive control, and
negative control at room temperature. b. Prepare working
dilutions of antigen and complement according to
manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Heat Inactivation: a. Heat inactivate patient and control sera by
placing in a water bath at 56°C for 30 minutes.
3. Testing: a. In a 96-well microtiter plate, add 50 μL of patient
sera, and positive and negative controls into respective wells. b.
Add 50 μL of antigen to each well. c. Add 50 μL of complement
to each well. d. Incubate the plate at 37°C for 1 hour. e. Add 50
μL of hemolytic system (sensitized sheep red blood cells) to
each well and incubate at 37°C for 45 minutes.
4. Reading Results: a. Observe for hemolysis. A positive result is
indicated by the absence of hemolysis (complement fixation). b.
Record the titer of the highest dilution of serum showing
inhibition of hemolysis.
B. Immunodiffusion (ID) Method:
1. Preparation: a. Thaw sera samples, positive control, and
negative control at room temperature. b. Equilibrate prepared
ID agar plates to room temperature.
2. Testing: a. Using a template or guide, punch wells into the agar
plate (center well for antigen and surrounding wells for serum
samples and controls). b. Add 10 μL of Histoplasma antigen to
the center well. c. Add 10 μL of patient serum, positive control,
and negative control to the surrounding wells. d. Incubate the
plates in a humid chamber at room temperature or 4°C (as per
manufacturer’s recommendation) for up to 72 hours.
3. Reading Results: a. Observe the plates daily or as specified, for
the development of precipitin lines. b. A positive result is
confirmed by the presence and specific patterning of precipitin
lines between adjacent wells containing the antigen and
antibody.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Run positive and negative controls with each batch of
patient samples.
◦ Document control results and ensure they are within
acceptable ranges before reporting patient results.
◦ Repeat any batch if control results are out of acceptable
range.
5. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ Record all results on laboratory documentation forms and
logbooks.
◦ Report results according to laboratory reporting guidelines.
◦ Note: CF results should include the titer level, and ID results
should describe the presence or absence of precipitin lines.
6. REFERENCE INTERVALS
◦ Complement Fixation (CF): Negative (<1:8), Positive (≥1:8,
report titer).
◦ Immunodiffusion (ID): Negative (no precipitin lines), Positive
(presence of precipitin lines corresponding to specific
Histoplasma antigens).
7. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• False positives can occur due to cross-reactivity with other fungal
infections.
• Immunocompromised patients may show altered antibody
responses.
• Interpretation of ID requires experience and may be subject to
subjective judgement.
