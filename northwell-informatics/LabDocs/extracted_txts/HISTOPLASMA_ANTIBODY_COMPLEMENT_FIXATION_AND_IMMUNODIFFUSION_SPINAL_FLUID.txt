Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Histoplasma Antibody
Complement Fixation (CF) and Immunodiffusion (ID) on Spinal
Fluid
1. PURPOSE
To ensure the accurate detection and measurement of antibodies to
Histoplasma capsulatum in spinal fluid using complement fixation
(CF) and immunodiffusion (ID) techniques.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing and
documenting Histoplasma antibody CF and ID tests. Staff and
supervisors ensure protocols are followed and temperatures are
maintained according to procedure.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Water bath or incubator (37±1°C)
• Microcentrifuge
• CF antigen (Histoplasma capsulatum)
• Complement source (guinea pig serum)
• Complement fixation buffer
• Standard CF positive and negative controls
• ID antigen (Histoplasma capsulatum)
• ID positive control serum and negative control serum
• ID Gel plates
• Diffusion buffer
• Microtiter plates
• Pipettes and tips
• Sterilized dilution tubes
• Absorbent pads
• Data logging system or laboratory notebook
1. PROCEDURE
A. Complement Fixation (CF) Testing:
1. Preparation of Reagents:
◦ Thaw all reagents and samples according to manufacturer’s
guidelines.
◦ Maintain reagents and samples at optimal temperatures
throughout the process.
2. Sample Preparation:
◦ Centrifuge the spinal fluid at 5000 RPM for 10 minutes to
remove any particulate matter.
◦ Use clarified supernatant for CF assay.
3. Plate Setup:
◦ In a microtiter plate, prepare serial dilutions of the patient's
spinal fluid (starting at 1:4 dilution) with CF buffer.
◦ Include wells for positive and negative controls.
4. Antigen Addition:
◦ Add equal volumes of CF antigen to all wells containing
dilutions.
5. Incubation:
◦ Incubate the microtiter plate at 37°C for 1 hour to allow
antigen and antibody interaction.
6. Complement Addition:
◦ Add prepared complement source to each well.
◦ Incubate for another 30 minutes at 37°C.
7. Indicator System Preparation:
◦ Prepare and add an appropriate indicator system
(hemolysin-sensitized sheep red blood cells or other).
8. Final Incubation:
◦ Incubate further at 37°C for 1 hour.
9. Reading Results:
◦ Centrifuge the plate to pellet any remaining cells.
◦ Observe for lysis. Complete lysis indicates a negative
reaction (no antibody) while no lysis indicates a positive
reaction.
B. Immunodiffusion (ID) Testing:
1. Preparation of Gel Plates:
◦ Utilize pre-manufactured gel plates or prepare agarose
plates according to kit instructions.
2. Sample and Control Application:
◦ Cut wells into the gel plate according to kit specifications.
◦ Apply patient’s spinal fluid into designated wells.
◦ Include positive and negative control sera into control wells.
3. Antigen Addition:
◦ Add equal amounts of Histoplasma ID antigen to respective
adjacent wells.
4. Diffusion:
◦ Allow the plate to sit undisturbed at room temperature for
48-72 hours, letting the antigen and antibody diffuse through
the gel.
5. Visualization:
◦ Examine plates for precipitin lines formed between the wells
of antigen and antibody.
6. Interpreting Results:
◦ Presence of precipitin lines indicates a positive result.
◦ Compare the pattern and intensity of lines with control wells
to ascertain the presence of Histoplasma antibodies.
C. Quality Control:
• Run a positive and negative control with every batch to ensure
test accuracy.
• Maintain a record of lots, expiration dates, and storage conditions
of all reagents.
• Regularly check calibration and maintenance schedules of water
baths, incubators, and centrifuges.
D. Reporting Results:
• Record all results including control results in the laboratory
information system.
• Results verification and interpretation must be performed by a
certified technologist.
• Abnormal or critical results need to be promptly reported to the
requesting physician or clinical team according to laboratory
protocol.

serological testing.
