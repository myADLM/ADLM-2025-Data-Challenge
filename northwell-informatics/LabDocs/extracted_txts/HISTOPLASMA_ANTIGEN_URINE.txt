SOP: Analytical Phase for Histoplasma Antigen Testing in Urine
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this procedure is to outline the steps
and responsibilities involved in the analytical phase of
generating results for histoplasma antigen testing in urine
samples.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory staff are responsible for
performing the histoplasma antigen testing in accordance with this
SOP, ensuring accuracy and reliability of results. Supervisors are
responsible for review and validation of test results and ensuring that
corrective actions are taken when necessary.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STORAGE
• Preferred Specimen: 10 mL of freshly voided midstream urine.
• Specimen must be stored refrigerated (2-8°C) if not tested
immediately.
• Specimens are stable for up to 24 hours at 2-8°C or can be frozen
at -20°C for longer storage.
• Avoid multiple freeze-thaw cycles.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens arriving in the laboratory more than 24 hours after
collection without refrigeration.
• Specimens that have not been stored correctly.
• Specimens without proper labeling or requisition information.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Histoplasma antigen detection kit (e.g., The Immy Histoplasma
Antigen EIA kit)
• Microplate reader capable of reading at 450 nm with reference at
620-650 nm
• Calibrated pipettes
• Disposable tips
• Urine containers
• Centrifuge (if needed)
• Timer
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
1. PROCEDURE A) Preparation:
• Allow all reagents and urine samples to reach room temperature
before use.
• Thoroughly mix urine samples by gentle inversion.
• Label all necessary microtiter wells according to the number of
specimens, standards, and controls to be tested.
B) Assay Procedure:
1. Pipette a specified volume (e.g., 50 µL) of urine sample into
each designated well.
2. Add specified volume (e.g., 50 µL) of the conjugate reagent to
each well. Mix gently by tapping the side of the plate.
3. Incubate the plate at room temperature for the time specified in
the kit insert (e.g., 60 minutes).
4. Wash the wells according to the kit instructions, typically 5
times with the provided buffer.
5. Add the substrate solution to each well and incubate in the dark
at room temperature for the specified time (e.g., 20 minutes).
6. Add the stop solution to each well to halt the reaction.
7. Read the absorbance at 450 nm using a microplate reader,
correcting at 620-650 nm as per the kit instructions.
C) Quality Control:
• Include positive and negative controls in each assay run.
• Internal controls must produce results within established ranges
for the run to be valid.
• Document all QC activities and results.
D) Interpretation of Results:
• Calculate the mean absorbance for each standard, control, and
specimen.
• Generate a standard curve from the standards provided in the kit.
• Determine the concentration of histoplasma antigen in each urine
sample by comparing the absorbance with the standard curve.
E) Reporting Results:
• Results are automatically recorded in the LIS and must be
reviewed by the technologist before verification.
• Any result falling outside the test's detectable range should be
repeated or reported with an appropriate comment.
1. QUALITY CONTROL AND TROUBLESHOOTING
• Perform QC as recommended by the kit manufacturer.
• If QC fails, identify and rectify the issue before proceeding with
additional patient samples.
• Document all corrective actions taken.
1. SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS
• Wear appropriate PPE at all times.
• Dispose of all biohazard waste according to facility protocols.
• Maintain hygiene and clean all spills immediately.
