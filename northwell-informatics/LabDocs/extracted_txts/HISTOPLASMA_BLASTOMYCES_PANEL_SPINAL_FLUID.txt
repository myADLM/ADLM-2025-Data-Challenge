1. PURPOSE
To describe the procedure for the detection of Histoplasma/
Blastomyces antigen in spinal fluid (CSF) using the Histoplasma/
Blastomyces antigen assay. The procedure ensures accurate and
timely results for the diagnosis of histoplasmosis and blastomycosis.
Responsibility: Designated staff are responsible for performing the
assay, monitoring quality control, and reporting results as defined in
this procedure. Staff must also follow corrective actions when
deviations occur.
1. PRINCIPLE
The Histoplasma/Blastomyces antigen assay is an immunoassay
used for the qualitative and quantitative detection of Histoplasma
capsulatum and Blastomyces dermatitidis antigens in spinal fluid
(CSF). The assay involves the use of antibodies to detect antigens
specific to Histoplasma and Blastomyces species.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENT
Preferred Specimen:
• 2-5 mL of spinal fluid (CSF) collected in a sterile container.
• Transport to the laboratory immediately; if transport is delayed,
store at 2-8°C for up to 24 hours. Do not freeze.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens received in unsterile containers.
• Specimens with visible contamination or hemolysis.
• Specimens stored for more than 24 hours at 2-8°C.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
Equipment:
• Centrifuge
• Micropipettes
• Vortex mixer
• Incubator
• Microplate reader set to appropriate wavelength as per assay
instructions
Reagents:
• Histoplasma/Blastomyces antigen assay kit (follow manufacturer’s
storage conditions and expiration dates)
• Controls (positive and negative) provided with the assay kit
• Calibrators provided with the assay kit
• Microplate washing solution
• Diluent solution
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run quality control specimens (positive and negative controls)
with each batch of patient samples.
• Quality control samples must be within the established range.
• If control results do not meet acceptance criteria, do not report
patient results, identify and resolve the issue, then rerun controls
and patient samples.
1. PROCEDURE
2. Pre-analytical phase:
◦ Ensure specimens are properly labeled and stored.
◦ Review specimen integrity and acceptability criteria.
3. Analytical phase: a. Prepare reagents and allow all components
to reach room temperature. b. Mix CSF samples well before
aliquoting. c. Centrifuge CSF samples at 1500 rpm for 10
minutes to remove any particulate matter. d. Use the provided
diluent to dilute samples as instructed in the assay kit insert. e.
Add designated volumes of diluted samples, controls, and
calibrators into the microplate wells. f. Follow the incubation
steps as provided in the manufacturer’s instructions. g. Wash
microplate wells as per the kit instructions. h. Add detection
antibodies/enzymes and incubate as instructed. i. Add substrate
solution and incubate for the required time period. j. Add stop
solution to each well when appropriate and ensure thorough
mixing.
4. Post-analytical phase: a. Read the microplate using the
microplate reader set to the wavelength specified in the kit
instructions. b. Generate a standard curve using the calibrators
provided. c. Interpret results by comparing patient sample
values to the standard curve. d. Validate assay by checking that
quality control results are within the specified range.
5. REPORTING RESULTS
• Record patient results on the lab report form or the laboratory
information system.
• Interpret results based on the generated standard curve.
• Positive results indicate the presence of Histoplasma or
Blastomyces antigens in the CSF.
• Report critical results immediately to the healthcare provider as
per reporting guidelines.
• Results must be reviewed and verified by a trained technologist
before reporting.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Negative: No detectable Histoplasma/Blastomyces antigen Positive:
Detectable levels of Histoplasma/Blastomyces antigen
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Follow the assay kit instructions for limitations specific to the
reagents.
• Cross-reactivity with other fungal species or substances in the
CSF could interfere with the results.
• Negative results do not preclude the presence of infection; clinical
correlation is necessary.

Include references from assay kit instructions and any relevant
clinical and laboratory guidelines.
Note: These steps should be reviewed and adjusted according to the
specific manufacturer’s instructions and any updates to clinical
guidelines.
