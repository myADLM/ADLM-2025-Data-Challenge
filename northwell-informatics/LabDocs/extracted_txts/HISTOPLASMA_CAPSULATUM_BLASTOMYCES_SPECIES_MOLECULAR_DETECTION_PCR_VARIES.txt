Standard Operating Procedure: Analytical Phase of Generating
Results for Histoplasma Capsulatum/Blastomyces Species,
Molecular Detection, PCR, Varies
1. Purpose
The purpose of this procedure is to outline the steps for processing
and analyzing specimens for the molecular detection of Histoplasma
capsulatum and Blastomyces species using polymerase chain
reaction (PCR). This procedure will ensure accurate and timely
identification of these pathogens to aid in effective patient
management.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory personnel with the appropriate training and
competency in molecular diagnostics are responsible for performing
this procedure according to the guidelines established herein.
Supervisors are responsible for ensuring compliance and addressing
any procedural issues that arise.
1. Specimen Preparation
Acceptable specimens:
• Sputum
• Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid
• Tissue biopsy
• Blood
Specimens should be transported to the laboratory immediately after
collection and stored at 2-8°C if processing is not performed
immediately.
1. Equipment and Reagents
• Biosafety cabinet
• Microcentrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Real-time PCR instrument
• Nucleic acid extraction kit
• PCR master mix specific for Histoplasma capsulatum/
Blastomyces species
• Sterile, nuclease-free microcentrifuge tubes and pipette tips
• Positive control (known Histoplasma or Blastomyces DNA)
• Negative control (nuclease-free water)
• DNA ladder
• Agarose gel electrophoresis equipment (if needed)
• Ethanol (70%)
1. Procedure
A. Nucleic Acid Extraction
1. Work in a biosafety cabinet to avoid contamination.
2. Aliquot the appropriate volume of specimen into a sterile
microcentrifuge tube.
3. Follow the nucleic acid extraction kit protocol to isolate DNA
from the specimen. Include both positive and negative
extraction controls.
4. Quantify and assess the purity of the extracted DNA using a
spectrophotometer (if necessary).
B. PCR Amplification
1. Prepare PCR master mix according to the manufacturer's
protocol. The master mix should include:
◦ PCR buffer
◦ dNTPs
◦ Primers specific for Histoplasma capsulatum and
Blastomyces species
◦ DNA polymerase
◦ Nuclease-free water
2. Aliquot the master mix into a PCR plate or tubes.
3. Add the extracted DNA from each specimen to the appropriate
wells, including positive and negative controls.
4. Seal the PCR plate or tubes and place them in the real-time
PCR instrument.
5. Run the PCR cycling program as follows:
◦ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 5 minutes
◦ 40 cycles of:
▪ Denaturation: 95°C for 15 seconds
▪ Annealing: 60°C for 30 seconds
▪ Extension: 72°C for 30 seconds
◦ Final extension: 72°C for 5 minutes
6. Analyze the PCR data using the real-time PCR instrument's
software.
C. Post-PCR Analysis
1. Assess the amplification curves for each specimen, positive
control, and negative control.
2. Based on the amplification curves, determine the presence or
absence of target DNA in each specimen.
3. Optionally, verify PCR products via agarose gel electrophoresis:
◦ Prepare a 1-2% agarose gel with appropriate DNA stain.
◦ Load PCR products and DNA ladder into the gel wells.
◦ Run electrophoresis at 100-150V until bands are well-
separated.
◦ Visualize DNA bands under UV light to confirm product size.
4. Quality Control
• Include positive and negative controls in each PCR run.
• Document and investigate any contamination or unexpected
results.
• Validate any new reagent lots or assay kits before use.
1. Reporting Results
• Record the results in the laboratory information system (LIS) with
proper identification of detected pathogens.
• Interpret results according to the PCR software and confirmatory
tests, if applicable:
◦ Positive for Histoplasma capsulatum
◦ Positive for Blastomyces species
◦ Negative
◦ Indeterminate (if necessary, repeat the test or perform
additional confirmatory testing)
