Protocol for HIT ANTIBODIES W/REFLEX
TO SEROTONIN RELEASE ASSAY (SRA)
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this protocol is to outline the procedure for the
detection of Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT) antibodies
with reflex testing to the Serotonin Release Assay (SRA) to ensure
accurate and reliable results for patient diagnosis and management.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to the analysis of specimens received in the
laboratory for HIT antibody testing, including those requiring reflex to
SRA.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
• Specimen type: Plasma (preferred), Serum
• Collection container: Lavender top (EDTA) or Blue top (Sodium
citrate) for plasma; Red or gold top for serum.
• Volume: 2 mL minimum
• Transport: Specimens should be transported to the laboratory
immediately or stored at 2-8°C if there is a delay and must be
processed within 24 hours.
• Rejection criteria: Hemolyzed, clotted, or improperly labeled
specimens
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Centrifuge
• HIT ELISA Kit
• Serotonin Release Assay (SRA) reagents
• Pipettes and tips
• Microplate reader
• Gloves and appropriate PPE
• Laboratory timer
• Specimen tubes
• Incubator
5. PROCEDURE
A. HIT Antibody ELISA Test
1. Preparation:
◦ Allow all reagents and specimens to come to room
temperature before use.
◦ Prepare the workbench and ensure all necessary materials
are present.
2. Specimen Processing:
◦ Centrifuge the blood specimen at 1500 x g for 10 minutes to
obtain plasma/serum.
◦ Transfer the clear plasma/serum to a clean labeled tube.
3. Perform the ELISA:
◦ Add 100 µL of patient specimen, positive control, and
negative control to designated wells in the ELISA plate.
◦ Incubate the plate at room temperature for 30 minutes.
◦ Wash the plate 4 times with the wash solution provided in
the kit.
◦ Add 100 µL of conjugate to each well. Incubate for 30
minutes at room temperature.
◦ Wash the plate 4 times with wash solution.
◦ Add 100 µL of TMB substrate to each well. Incubate for 10
minutes in the dark.
◦ Add 100 µL of stop solution to each well.
◦ Read the absorbance at 450 nm using a microplate reader.
4. Interpret the Results:
◦ Calculate the average optical density (OD) for duplicates of
controls and patient specimens.
◦ Determine the presence of HIT antibodies based on the OD
values and kit-specific cut-offs.
B. Reflex to Serotonin Release Assay (SRA)
1. Initiate Reflex Testing:
◦ If the HIT antibody result is positive or indeterminate,
proceed with the SRA.
2. SRA Preparation:
◦ Warm Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP) and Platelet-Poor
Plasma (PPP) from a healthy volunteer to 37°C.
◦ Prepare serotonin-loaded platelets.
3. Perform the SRA:
◦ Mix 100 µL of patient plasma with 100 µL of serotonin-
loaded platelets.
◦ Incubate the mixture at 37°C for 1 hour.
◦ Centrifuge the mixture at 1000 x g for 10 minutes to obtain
the supernatant.
◦ Measure the serotonin release using a fluorometric or
luminometric assay.
4. Interpret the SRA Results:
◦ Compare the serotonin release from patient plasma to
controls.
◦ Determine the presence of platelet activation, indicative of
HIT, based on predefined criteria.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run positive and negative controls with each ELISA and SRA
assay batch.
• Ensure all equipment is calibrated and maintained according to
manufacturer’s guidelines.
• Document all quality control measures and troubleshooting steps.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
• Review and verify the ELISA and SRA results.
• Report the HIT antibody and SRA results through the Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
• If HIT antibodies are positive and the SRA is positive, indicate a
high probability of HIT.
• If HIT antibodies are positive and the SRA is negative, suggest
further clinical correlation.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolyzed or clotted specimens can interfere with accurate
results.
• Results should be interpreted in the context of patient’s clinical
conditions.
