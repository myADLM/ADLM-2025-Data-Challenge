Protocol for HIT Antibody by Serotonin Release Assay (SRA)
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for processing and analyzing specimens for
HIT antibody detection using the Serotonin Release Assay (SRA),
ensuring that the laboratory results are accurate and reliable.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of the trained laboratory staff to follow this
protocol to ensure accurate analysis and adhere to all quality control
measures.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type:
• Fresh platelet-rich plasma (PRP) and platelet-poor plasma (PPP).
Collection:
• Collect blood in ACD (acid-citrate-dextrose) or citrate tubes.
• Gently invert the tubes 5-10 times immediately to mix the
anticoagulant with the blood.
• Transport the specimen to the laboratory at room temperature
within 4 hours of collection.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Clotted samples.
• Grossly hemolyzed samples.
• Specimens from patients on anticoagulant therapy.
• Specimens not processed within 4 hours of collection.
1. PRE-ANALYTICAL PREPARATION
A. Preparation of Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP)
1. Centrifuge the blood sample at 150 x g for 10 minutes at room
temperature with the brake off.
2. Carefully transfer the upper PRP layer into a separate, sterile
tube.
3. Platelet count should be adjusted to 200,000 platelets/µL.
B. Preparation of Platelet-Poor Plasma (PPP)
1. Centrifuge the remaining blood at 2500 x g for 15 minutes.
2. Carefully transfer the upper PPP layer into a separate, sterile
tube without disturbing the buffy coat layer.
3. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• Washed donor platelets (collected in sodium citrate and washed
with Tyrode’s buffer).
• Positive control (patient with known HIT).
• Negative control (normal plasma).
• [3H] serotonin.
• Tyrode’s buffer.
• Centrifuge.
• Pipettes and tips.
1. PROCEDURE
2. Platelet Sensitization a. Incubate 100 µL of patient’s PRP or
control with 50 µL of washed donor platelets. b. Add 5 µL of
[3H] serotonin (approximately 50,000 CPM) to the mixture. c.
Incubate at 37°C for 1 hour with gentle agitation.
3. Release Reaction a. Spin the mixture at 12,000 x g for 2
minutes to pellet the platelets. b. Transfer the supernatant to a
fresh tube.
4. Measurement of Serotonin Release a. Count the radioactivity
of the supernatant using a beta counter. b. Express results as a
percentage of total serotonin released. Calculation: % Release
= (CPM of supernatant / Total CPM) x 100
5. Controls a. Perform the assay in parallel with positive and
negative controls to ensure assay validity. b. Include blanks for
background subtraction.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
A. Internal Quality Control
1. Include positive and negative controls in each batch.
2. Ensure that the positive control releases serotonin > 50%.
3. Negative control should show serotonin release < 5%.
B. Inter-Laboratory Quality Control
1. Participate in proficiency testing programs.
2. Compare results periodically with reference laboratories.
3. REPORTING RESULTS
A. Results should be calculated and expressed as a percentage of
serotonin release. B. Report as:
• Positive for HIT antibodies: Serotonin release > 20%
• Negative for HIT antibodies: Serotonin release < 20%
1. REFERENCE RANGES
• Serotonin release > 20% indicative of HIT antibodies.
• Serotonin release < 20% indicative of no HIT antibodies.
1. RESULT REVIEW AND VERIFICATION
A. Technologists must review results for accuracy. B. Any result
discrepancies should be resolved by retesting. C. Documentation of
all results and any corrective actions taken must be maintained.
1. DOCUMENTATION
A. Maintain a log of all specimens processed, including patient
details, sample condition, and results. B. Document all quality control
checks and corrective actions.
