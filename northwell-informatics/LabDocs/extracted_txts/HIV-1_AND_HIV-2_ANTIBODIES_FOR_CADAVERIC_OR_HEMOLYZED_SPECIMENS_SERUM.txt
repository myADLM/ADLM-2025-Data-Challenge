PROTOCOL FOR THE ANALYTICAL PHASE OF GENERATING
RESULTS FOR HIV-1 AND HIV-2 ANTIBODIES FOR CADAVERIC
OR HEMOLYZED SPECIMENS, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
This procedure delineates the standardized process for the analytical
phase involved in the detection of HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibodies in
cadaveric or hemolyzed serum specimens to ensure accuracy and
reliability of results in compliance with CLIA standards.
Responsibility:
All staff must follow the protocol precisely. Any deviations,
deficiencies or aberrations must be promptly reported to the
supervising laboratory technologist.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Preferred Specimen:
• Serum from cadaveric or hemolyzed specimens.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Serum samples exhibiting gross contamination or improper
labeling.
Specimen Stability:
• Cadaveric serum: Stable for 7 days at 2-8°C.
• Hemolyzed serum: Stable for 5 days at 2-8°C.
• If the specimen cannot be analyzed within the designated period,
freeze at -20°C with clear labeling indicating the type of specimen
(cadaveric / hemolyzed).
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
◦ ELISA Reader
◦ Microtiter Plates
◦ Pipettes and tips
◦ Wash Buffer
◦ HIV-1/HIV-2 Antibody Reagent Kit (Observe vendor's expiry
date)
◦ Calibrators, Controls (negative and positive)
◦ Incubator set to 37°C
◦ Timer
2. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Bring all reagents, samples, controls, and calibrators to room
temperature before starting the assay.
2. Set up the ELISA plate reader and incubator.
Testing:
1. Sample and Control Preparation:
◦ Label the designated wells for samples, controls, and
calibrators.
◦ Add 1:10 dilution of patient specimen, positive control, and
negative control into appropriately labeled wells.
2. Assay Procedure:
◦ Add 50 μL of diluted patient sample, controls, and
calibrators into the wells.
◦ Add 100 μL of conjugate solution to all wells, ensuring no
bubbles are present.
◦ Incubate the plate at 37°C for 30 minutes.
◦ Wash the wells 6 times with 300 μL wash buffer, tap the
plate onto a clean paper towel to remove any residual liquid.
◦ Add 100 μL of substrate solution to each well, incubate in
the dark at room temperature for 20 minutes.
◦ Add 100 μL of stop solution to each well to terminate the
reaction.
3. Reading and Interpretation:
◦ Read the absorbance at 450 nm using the ELISA plate
reader within 15 minutes of stopping the reaction.
◦ Compare samples' absorbance values against the positive
and negative controls to determine the presence of HIV-1
and HIV-2 antibodies.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
5. Control and Calibration:
◦ Each new lot of reagent kit should be calibrated and verified
with positive and negative controls.
◦ Each run must include controls to ensure the kit and
process are performing to expected standards.
6. Internal Quality Control:
◦ Run two levels of control (one positive, one negative) with
each batch of samples.
◦ Record all control results. If control results fall outside the
acceptable range, run the controls again with a fresh set of
reagents.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
8. Review and Verification:
◦ Ensure that all quality control criteria have been met before
verifying results.
◦ Review patient results against controls and calculate the
cut-off value to determine if the sample is reactive or non-
reactive for HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibodies.
9. Interpretation and Documentation:
◦ Report results as “Reactive” if the sample absorbance is
greater than the cut-off value.
◦ Report results as “Non-Reactive” if the sample absorbance
is less than or equal to the cut-off value.
◦ Document all results, including any deviations and
corrective actions taken, if necessary.
