HIV-1 AND HIV-2 ANTIBODY CONFIRMATION AND
DIFFERENTIATION, PLASMA
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this protocol is to outline the procedure for confirming
and differentiating HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibodies in plasma specimens.
This protocol ensures accurate and reliable identification of HIV-1
and HIV-2 infections.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the assay,
analyzing the results, and documenting findings according to the
procedure outlined. Supervisors are responsible for overseeing the
process and addressing any issues that arise.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred Specimen:
• Plasma collected in an EDTA or Heparin tube.
Specimen Stability:
• Specimens should be processed within 72 hours if stored at
2-8°C.
• For long-term storage, freeze at -20°C or lower. The specimen is
stable for up to 6 months.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed specimens.
• Specimens that have not been processed within the specified
timeframe.
• Specimens with incorrect labeling or without a collection date/
time.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
Equipment:
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes
• Automated or manual immunoassay analyzer (e.g., BioRad
Geenius HIV 1/2 supplemental assay instrument)
• Incubator (37°C)
• Refrigerator (2-8°C)
• Freezer (-20°C or colder)
Reagents:
• HIV-1/HIV-2 differentiation assay kit (e.g., Geenius HIV-1/2
supplemental assay)
• Controls (positive and negative for both HIV-1 and HIV-2
antibodies)
• Calibrators
• Diluent (if required by the assay)
1. PROCEDURE
Preliminary steps:
• Verify the specimen has been correctly labeled and is acceptable
according to the specifications above.
• Allow frozen specimens to thaw at room temperature before
processing.
A. Specimen Preparation:
1. Centrifuge plasma samples at 1,200-2,000 g for 15 minutes to
separate plasma from cells.
2. Transfer the supernatant (plasma) into a clean, labeled tube.
3. Handle specimens and controls under biohazard safety
protocols.
B. Assay Setup:
1. Prepare reagent and controls according to manufacturer’s
instructions.
2. Set up the immunoassay analyzer according to the protocol
provided in the kit.
3. Load the specimen and controls onto the analyzer platform.
4. Start the assay run.
C. Running the Assay:
1. Follow the manufacturer’s specific instructions for the
differentiation kit.
2. Allow the automated or manual process to run to completion.
3. Ensure temperature-regulated incubation steps are followed as
specified.
D. Interpretation of Results:
1. Analyze the resulting data for presence and differentiation of
HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibodies.
2. Compare specimen results to control and calibrator reactions to
ensure accuracy.
3. Document the results in the laboratory information system
(LIS).
E. Quality Control:
1. Run positive and negative controls with each batch of
specimens to verify assay accuracy.
2. Document quality control results.
3. If quality control fails, do not report patient results until the issue
is resolved.
F. Troubleshooting:
1. If an error occurs during the assay, follow the troubleshooting
steps outlined in the kit insert.
2. Document any issues and corrective actions taken.
3. If the error persists, contact the supervisor or technical support
from the manufacturer.
4. REPORTING RESULTS
Results should be carefully reviewed and verified by the technologist.
• Confirmatory positive for HIV-1 antibodies.
• Confirmatory positive for HIV-2 antibodies.
• Negative for neither HIV-1 nor HIV-2 antibodies.
Document and provide result interpretation according to site-specific
reporting guidelines. Critical results should be communicated
promptly to the requesting healthcare provider.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Positive for HIV-1 antibodies: > Threshold provided in kit Positive for
HIV-2 antibodies: > Threshold provided in kit Negative: < Threshold
provided in kit
Refer to the manufacturer’s insert for specific performance
characteristics and limitations.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Detailed information regarding the limitations of the assay can be
found in the manufacturer’s package insert. Factors affecting results
include specimen quality, handling errors, and timing of infection.
