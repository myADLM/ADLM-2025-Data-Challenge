HIV-1 AND HIV-2 ANTIBODY CONFIRMATION AND
DIFFERENTIATION, PRENATAL, PLASMA
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this protocol is to confirm and differentiate HIV-1 and
HIV-2 antibodies in prenatal plasma specimens. This procedure is to
ensure accurate detection and reporting of HIV status in pregnant
patients, supporting appropriate clinical management and
intervention.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of qualified laboratory personnel to perform this
procedure including processing, testing, documentation,
interpretation, and reporting of results. Laboratory personnel must
abide by all safety and quality assurance protocols.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred Specimen Type:
• Plasma collected in EDTA tubes
Specimen Handling and Stability:
• Specimens should be stored at 2-8°C and are stable for up to 5
days.
• For long-term storage, specimens should be frozen at -20°C or
lower.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed or lipemic specimens are not acceptable and should
be rejected.
• Specimens not labeled with the date/time of collection or patient
identification details.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes and tips
• Incubator
• Plate reader compatible with the testing kit
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) including gloves, lab coat,
and safety glasses
Reagents:
• HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody confirmation and differentiation kit
• Controls (positive and negative)
• Running and wash buffers
• Substrate solution
• Stop solution
Supplies:
• 96-well microtiter plates
• Micropipettes
• Timer
5. PROCEDURE
1. Preparation:
◦ Allow all reagents and specimens to reach room
temperature.
◦ Label microtiter plate wells to correspond with specimens,
controls, and blank wells.
2. Specimen and Control Addition:
◦ Add 100 µL of plasma specimen, positive control, and
negative control to the appropriate wells.
◦ Seal the plate and incubate as per kit instructions (usually
30-60 minutes at 37°C).
3. Washing:
◦ Wash the wells using the wash buffer (as specified by the
kit), typically 5 cycles.
◦ Ensure complete removal of the washing buffer after the last
wash cycle.
4. Secondary Reagent Addition:
◦ Add 100 µL of the secondary reagent to each well as
indicated by the kit.
◦ Seal the plate and incubate as per kit instructions.
5. Substrate Addition:
◦ Wash the wells again as described above.
◦ Add 100 µL of substrate solution to each well.
◦ Incubate for the time specified in the kit instructions, usually
15-30 minutes, but avoid exposure to light.
6. Stopping the Reaction:
◦ Add 50 µL of stop solution to each well.
◦ Mix gently by tapping the plate.
7. Reading Results:
◦ Read the microtiter plate at the wavelength specified by the
testing kit, usually 450 nm with a reference filter set at
620-650 nm.
◦ Record absorbance values.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Internal Control:
◦ Perform the assay using positive and negative controls
along with patient specimens. Controls must fall within
expected ranges for the assay to be valid.
2. External Quality Assurance:
◦ Participate in proficiency testing programs to ensure the
accuracy and reliability of the assay.
7. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
1. Validation:
◦ Ensure that all controls meet the criteria specified in the kit
insert.
2. Positive Result:
◦ A sample is considered positive if the absorbance value is
greater than or equal to the cutoff value provided by the kit
for either HIV-1 or HIV-2 antibodies.
3. Negative Result:
◦ A sample is considered negative if the absorbance value is
less than the cutoff value.
4. Indeterminate or Invalid Results:
◦ Repeat testing if results are indeterminate or if controls fail
to perform as expected.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Documentation:
◦ Record all results, including control values, in the laboratory
information system (LIS).
2. Turnaround Time:
◦ Report results within 24-48 hours after specimen receipt.
3. Communication:
◦ Notify the clinician promptly of any positive results as per
laboratory policy.
◦ Ensure proper documentation of critical results and follow
standard operating procedures for result verification and
release.
9. SAFETY AND WASTE DISPOSAL
1. Safety Precautions:
◦ Wear appropriate PPE at all times.
◦ Avoid pipetting by mouth. Use mechanical pipetting devices.
2. Waste Disposal:
◦ Dispose of all biohazardous waste, including used microtiter
plates and reagents, in accordance with local regulations
and laboratory protocols.
