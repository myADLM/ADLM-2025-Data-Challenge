HIV-1 AND HIV-2 ANTIBODY CONFIRMATION AND
DIFFERENTIATION PRENATAL, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
To provide a detailed procedure for confirming and differentiating
HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibodies in prenatal serum to ensure accurate
detection and identification of HIV infections in pregnant women.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/acceptable:
• 3-5 mL of serum. Specimen should be collected in a red-top or
serum separator tube (SST).
Unacceptable:
• Specimens that are hemolyzed, lipemic or improperly labeled.
• Specimens that arrive more than 48 hours after collection without
appropriate storage conditions.
• Specimens with insufficient volume.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• HIV-1/HIV-2 Antibody Differentiation Assay Kit
• Centrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Timer
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
• Refrigerator (2-8°C) and Freezer (-20°C)
• Incubator (35-37°C)
• Disposable gloves
• Laboratory documentation materials (e.g., log sheets)
4. PROCEDURE
Pre-analytical Phase:
• Verify specimen suitability (volume, condition, labeling).
• Document the receipt of the specimens in laboratory information
system.
• Centrifuge the collected serum samples at 1,000-1,200 x g for 10
minutes.
Analytical Phase:
1. Reagent Preparation:
◦ Prepare reagents as per the manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Equilibrate all reagents, specimens, and equipment at room
temperature.
2. Panel Test Preparation:
◦ Label the wells of the assay plate according to the position
chart provided in the kit.
◦ Add the required volume of each reagent/serum in the
appropriate wells.
3. Sample Application:
◦ Using a pipette, transfer a specified volume of serum
(typically 10-20 µL) to each well coated with the antigens.
4. Incubation:
◦ Incubate the plate at the specified temperature (35-37°C) for
the required period (usually 30 minutes to 1 hour).
5. Washing:
◦ Wash the wells according to the instructions to ensure
removal of unbound substances. Generally, 3-5 washes with
kit-specific buffer.
6. Detection:
◦ Apply the detection reagent (enzyme-conjugated secondary
antibody).
◦ Incubate for the required period (typically 30 minutes).
7. Substrate Application:
◦ Add the substrate solution. Allow the color to develop as per
kit instructions (typically 10-30 minutes).
8. Stop Reaction:
◦ Add the stop solution to arrest the color development.
9. Result Reading:
◦ Measure the optical density at the recommended
wavelength using a plate reader.
◦ Compare results to control and reference standards
provided with the kit.
10. Interpretation:
◦ Interpret the results based on the optical density values and
the differentiation criteria outlined in the kit instructions.
◦ Confirm positive results with clinical context and correlate
with patient history and other laboratory findings.
Post-analytical Phase:
• Record the results in the laboratory information system (LIS).
• Generate and verify laboratory reports.
• Ensure the appropriate documentation of quality control data.
• Communicate the results to the ordering physician, particularly if
critical values or positive results requiring immediate attention are
observed.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform internal controls provided in the kit with each run.
• Document all control results and ensure they fall within the
acceptable range.
• If control results are out of range, troubleshoot using kit guidelines
before reporting patient results.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
• Document qualitative results (positive/negative) and quantitative
values if applicable.
• Review and verify results before reporting.
• Follow site-specific guidelines for reporting results.

screening.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to assay kit insert for limitations regarding reagent
specificity and sensitivity.
• Note any specific conditions that may interfere with the results
(e.g., other infections or antibody cross-reactivity).
