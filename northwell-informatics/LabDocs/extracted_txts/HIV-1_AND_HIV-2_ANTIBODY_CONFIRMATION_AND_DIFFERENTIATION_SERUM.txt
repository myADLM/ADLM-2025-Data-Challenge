Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Title: HIV-1 and HIV-2 Antibody
Confirmation and Differentiation, Serum
1. PURPOSE
To provide a detailed procedure for the confirmation and
differentiation of HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibodies in serum samples to
ensure the accurate and reliable reporting of results.
1. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel who perform the HIV-1
and HIV-2 antibody confirmation and differentiation test in the
laboratory.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
Laboratory staff are responsible for conducting the HIV-1 and HIV-2
antibody confirmation and differentiation test, documenting all
processes, and ensuring all quality control measures are properly
followed.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred Specimen:
• Serum from clot activator tubes (red-top tubes or serum separator
tubes).
Specimen Handling and Stability:
• Specimens should be stored at 2-8°C and tested within 7 days of
collection.
• Long-term storage requires freezing at -20°C or colder.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens with visible hemolysis or lipemia.
• Specimens collected in incorrect tubes or those that have been
improperly stored.
• Specimens with inadequate volume for testing.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
Equipment:
• Microplate reader.
• Plate washer.
• Incubator capable of maintaining 37°C.
• Timer.
• Pipettes and associated sterile tips.
• Laboratory centrifuge.
Reagents:
• HIV-1/HIV-2 differentiation assay kit (E.g., Bio-Rad Geenius™ HIV
1/2 Confirmation Assay).
• HIV-1/HIV-2 controls (positive and negative).
• Reagent-grade water.
• Sterile disposable gloves.
• Personal protective equipment (PPE).
1. PROCEDURE
2. Pre-Test Preparation:
◦ Review the assay kit insert and ensure all reagents and
equipment are ready.
◦ Wear appropriate PPE.
3. Assay Setup:
◦ Allow all reagents and specimens to reach room
temperature.
◦ Label microplates appropriately and ensure all test wells
and controls are correctly identified.
4. Sample Preparation:
◦ Centrifuge serum samples at room temperature for 10
minutes at 1,000-1,200 x g.
◦ Transfer the required amount of supernatant to new sterile
tubes.
5. Controls:
◦ Include both positive and negative controls in each run to
ensure assay validity.
◦ Prepare controls as instructed in the assay kit insert.
6. Sample and Control Addition:
◦ Carefully add the required volume of serum samples and
controls to the respective wells.
7. Incubation and Washing:
◦ Incubate the plate at 37°C for the time specified by the kit's
manufacturer.
◦ Wash the plate according to the manufacturer's instructions
(typically multiple wash cycles).
8. Adding Detection Reagents:
◦ Follow the specific steps detailed in the kit insert for adding
detection reagents to each well.
◦ Allow each reagent to react for the specified time intervals.
9. Reading Results:
◦ Add the stopping solution as recommended.
◦ Read the plate using a microplate reader at the specified
wavelength.
◦ Record the absorbance values.
10. Interpretation of Results:
◦ Use the criteria outlined by the assay manufacturer to
interpret the results (e.g., presence or absence of specific
bands for HIV-1 and HIV-2).
◦ Validate the run with the control results.
◦ For indeterminate results, repeat the test or utilize
supplementary confirmatory tests as needed.
11. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform quality control procedures with each run and record the
results:
◦ Positive control and negative control must produce expected
results.
◦ If controls fail, troubleshoot per the manufacturer's guidelines,
re-run the controls, and test samples again.
◦ Document any deviations or corrective actions taken.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Record results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Preliminary Positive HIV-1: If only HIV-1 antibodies are confirmed.
• Preliminary Positive HIV-2: If only HIV-2 antibodies are confirmed.
• Dual Infection: If both HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibodies are confirmed.
• Negative: If neither HIV-1 nor HIV-2 antibodies are confirmed.
• Indeterminate: If the result pattern does not match any of the
above categories, recommend further testing or additional
confirmatory methods.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Negative: No HIV-1 or HIV-2 antibodies detected.
• Positive: HIV-1 and/or HIV-2 antibodies detected.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the assay kit insert for specific limitations regarding:
• Potential cross-reactivity.
• Effects of hemolysis, lipemia, and icteric samples.
• Assay sensitivity and specificity values.
