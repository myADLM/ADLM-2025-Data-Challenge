HIV-1 AND HIV-2 ANTIBODY SCREEN FOR HEMOLYZED
SPECIMENS, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for performing HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibody
screening on hemolyzed serum specimens and ensuring precise,
accurate, and timely results.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory staff must adhere to the protocol for handling
hemolyzed serum specimens and perform accurate antibody
screenings with appropriate follow-up actions required.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/Acceptable:
• Hemolyzed serum specimens due to mechanical disruption or
RBC lysis during collection or processing can be used in this
screening procedure.
• Specimen characteristics: Visual presence of red discoloration
due to hemolysis, centrifuged, clot-free.
Unacceptable:
• Specimens that present severe hemolysis, compromising the
integrity and accurate interpretation of results (dark red or brown
discoloration).
• Specimens arriving in laboratory without proper identification,
collection date, and time info.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody screening kit (as per laboratory’s current
validated system, such as ELISA, chemiluminescence
immunoassays, or similar FDA-approved platforms).
• Centrifuge
• Sample tubes (properly labeled and sealed)
• Laboratory pipettes and tips
• Reagent storage (ensure kits are within expiry dates)
• Control material (positive and negative controls for quality
assurance)
• Timer
• Laboratory workstation/disposables (gloves, lab coat, waste bin,
etc.)
4. PROCEDURE
Sample Preparation:
1. Centrifuge the hemolyzed serum specimen at 1500-2000 g for
10-15 minutes to clarify serum.
2. Carefully pipette the serum avoiding significant disturbance or
further hemolysis; transfer it to appropriately labeled secondary
tubes for processing.
Testing Procedure:
1. Ensure all equipment and reagents are prepared according to
manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Perform a quality control check using positive and negative
controls to confirm assay reliability.
3. Add the prepared serum specimen to the assay wells or tubes
as per the protocol defined by the HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody kit.
4. Follow standard incubation periods and washing steps outlined
by the manufacturer.
5. Read results using the laboratory’s detection or reader system
(e.g. plate reader for ELISA).
Documentation and Result Evaluation:
1. Record all essential details like date, specimen ID, assay batch
number, and control results in the logbook.
2. Evaluate the test results considering potential interference from
hemolysis. Note any abnormality.
3. For questionably high or inconsistent results, consider retesting
using a freshly prepared or differently handled specimen.
Reporting Results: Results must be documented according to
laboratory standards and include identifying comments if hemolysis
impacted readability. Report and verify according to LIS guidelines:
• Negative HIV-1/HIV-2 Antibody: Interpret and document in patient
records.
• Positive HIV-1/HIV-2 Antibody: Initiate confirmatory tests (such as
western blot or PCR as per lab protocol) and notify infection
control in cases of positive confirmation.
• Indeterminate or questionable results: Perform a repeat test and
consult with the supervising technologist.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
Control checks must be performed each day of testing and recorded
in the quality control log.
• Ensure bi-weekly correlation checks between samples and
external validated controls.
• Reagent and equipment discrepancies noted should be rectified
before continued testing.
6. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolyzed specimens may interfere with direct optical measures
or introduce biases in signal detection. Confirm results via
secondary methods if necessary.
• Hemolysis severity should be assessed upfront; avoid extreme
hemolysis which severely compromises result validity.

immunoassays.
Note: This protocol must be periodically revised to incorporate
changes in guidelines and manufacturer updates to satisfy regulatory
compliance and maintain test accuracy.
