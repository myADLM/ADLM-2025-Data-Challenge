HIV-1 and HIV-2 Antigen and Antibody Diagnostic Evaluation,
Plasma
1. PURPOSE
To establish a standard protocol for the analytical phase of
generating results for the diagnostic evaluation of HIV-1 and HIV-2
antigen and antibody in plasma samples using a CLIA-certified
methodology to ensure valid, accurate, and reliable results.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing the
test according to this protocol, ensuring that all steps are followed
accurately and results are reviewed and recorded accordingly.
1. DEFINITION
HIV-1 and HIV-2 diagnostic evaluation involves testing plasma
samples for the presence of both HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibodies (IgG
and IgM) and the p24 antigen, which is specific to HIV-1 infection.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Automated immunoassay analyzer (e.g., Abbott Architect, Roche
Cobas)
• HIV-1/2 combo Ag/Ab assay kits specific to the analyzer
• Calibrators and controls (positive and negative)
• Pipettes and tips
• Plasma sample tubes
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
1. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Handling:
• Ensure plasma specimens have been properly collected,
received, and accessioned.
• Store specimens at 2-8°C if testing will be conducted within 7
days.
• For long-term storage, freeze specimens at -20°C or lower.
• Before testing, allow frozen specimens to thaw completely and
bring them to room temperature.
B. Preparation and Calibration:
• Power on the analyzer and allow initialization.
• Verify that all reagents, calibrators, and controls are within their
expiration date and have been stored appropriately.
• Load the reagents into the analyzer according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
• Perform calibration using the manufacturer-provided calibrators.
Follow the instrument’s instructions for calibration.
C. Quality Control:
• Include both positive and negative quality control samples in each
batch of testing.
• Document the results of the quality control samples and ensure
they are within the acceptable range before proceeding with
patient samples.
• If the control results are outside acceptable limits, troubleshoot
and repeat until proper control results are obtained.
D. Testing Procedure:
• Load the plasma samples onto the designated sample tray or
carousel of the analyzer.
• Input the sample information into the system ensuring each
sample is correctly labeled.
• Select the HIV-1/2 combi Ag/Ab assay from the assay menu.
• Ensure the correct testing protocol is chosen and initiate the
testing process.
• The analyzer will automatically perform the following:
◦ Sample aspiration
◦ Reagent dispensing
◦ Incubation
◦ Washing
◦ Detection and measurement
E. Result Analysis:
• Once the run is complete, the analyzer will generate raw data
including signal-to-cutoff ratios (S/CO) for each sample.
• Review the data ensuring all samples have valid results.
• Consider the positive and negative cutoff values as specified in
the assay kit’s package insert.
◦ Signal-to-cutoff ratio (S/CO) < 1.0 is considered negative.
◦ Signal-to-cutoff ratio (S/CO) ≥ 1.0 is considered presumptive
positive.
F. Interpretation and Reporting:
• Presumptive positive results must be confirmed with a
supplemental test (e.g., HIV-1/HIV-2 differentiation assay,
Western blot, or nucleic acid test).
• Report results according to the site-specific guidelines:
◦ If negative, report as non-reactive for HIV-1/2 antigen/antibody.
◦ If presumptive positive, report as reactive and send for
confirmatory testing.
• Document any critical or urgent results according to the laboratory
protocol including notifying the referring physician immediately.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Negative: S/CO < 1.0
• Presumptive positive: S/CO ≥ 1.0
1. QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE
• Conduct regular maintenance and calibration of the immunoassay
analyzer according to the manufacturer’s recommendations.
• Document all maintenance and troubleshooting activities.
• Participate in appropriate external quality assurance programs to
ensure the ongoing accuracy of test results.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the specific manufacturer’s package insert for assay
limitations and potential causes of false-positive/negative results.
