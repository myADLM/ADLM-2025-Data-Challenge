Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for HIV-1 and HIV-2
Antigen and Antibody Diagnostic Evaluation, Serum
1. PURPOSE
This protocol describes the procedure for the diagnostic evaluation of
HIV-1 and HIV-2 antigens and antibodies in serum specimens using
approved immunoassay techniques. The goal is to ensure accurate
and reliable results for the detection and differentiation of HIV-1 and
HIV-2 infections.
Responsibility:
• The designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing,
documenting, and reviewing all aspects of this procedure.
• It is the responsibility of the laboratory supervisor to ensure
adherence to this SOP and to address any issues that may arise
during testing.
1. DEFINITION
HIV-1 and HIV-2 are two different types of HIV, the virus which
causes AIDS. The detection of antigens and antibodies in serum can
help diagnose and differentiate between these two infections.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• Approved HIV-1 and HIV-2 immunoassay kits
• Calibrated micropipettes and pipette tips
• Serological pipettes
• Centrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Incubator
• Plate washer (if applicable)
• Plate reader capable of measuring optical density (OD)
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
• Specimen containers
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
• Specimen type: Serum
• Preferred specimen: Serum collected in a red or gold-top tube
• Stability: Specimens are stable at 2-8°C for up to 7 days. For
longer storage, specimens should be frozen at -20°C or below.
Unacceptable specimens:
• Specimens with gross hemolysis
• Specimens collected in anticoagulant tubes other than specified
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Use positive and negative controls provided by the kit
manufacturer.
• Verify kit expiration dates and handle reagents according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
• Internal quality control should be performed with each batch of
tests to ensure assay validity.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation of Specimens
• Allow serum specimens to come to room temperature before
testing.
• Vortex specimens to ensure homogeneity.
• Centrifuge any specimens that exhibit particulate matter.
B. Assay Procedure
1. Label wells of the microtiter plate with specimen identification.
2. Add the appropriate volume of serum specimen as specified by
the assay kit to each well.
3. Add controls to designated wells according to the kit
instructions.
4. Follow manufacturer's instructions for the specific sequence of
reagent additions.
5. Incubate the plate at the specified temperature and time as
directed by the kit insert.
6. Wash wells as required using the plate washer or manual
washing techniques.
7. Add substrate solution to each well and incubate as specified.
8. Read the optical densities (OD) using the plate reader at the
wavelength specified by the kit instructions.
C. Interpretation of Results
• Analyze the OD values against the cut-off value provided by the
kit manufacturer.
• Interpret results according to the guidelines provided in the kit
insert. Typically:
◦ Positive: OD values exceeding the cut-off value.
◦ Negative: OD values below the cut-off value.
◦ Indeterminate: OD values around the cut-off value;
recommend repeat testing.
D. Documentation and Reporting
• Record the OD values and corresponding interpretations.
• Ensure all results are reviewed and verified before reporting.
• Report results to the LIS system and notify clinical personnel of
any critical results immediately.
E. Troubleshooting
• If QC controls fail, do not report patient results. Investigate the
failure and repeat the assay.
• Check equipment functionality, reagent integrity, and procedural
compliance.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Not applicable as results are qualitative (positive or negative).
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to specific assay kit insert for limitations, including potential
cross-reactions, interference by certain substances, and validity
period of the reagents.
1. SAFETY
All personnel must adhere to standard laboratory safety protocols
and use appropriate PPE while handling specimens and reagents.

immunoassay.
• Latest clinical guidelines for HIV testing from recognized health
authorities (e.g., CDC, WHO).
By following this SOP, laboratory personnel can ensure reliable and
effective testing for HIV-1 and HIV-2 antigens and antibodies in
serum specimens. This protocol must be reviewed and updated
regularly to incorporate any changes in best practices or
manufacturer guidelines.
