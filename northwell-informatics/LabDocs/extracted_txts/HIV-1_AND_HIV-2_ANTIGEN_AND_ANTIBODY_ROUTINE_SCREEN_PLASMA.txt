Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): HIV-1 and HIV-2 Antigen
and Antibody Routine Screen, Plasma
1. PURPOSE
To establish standardized procedures for the analytical phase of
testing plasma specimens for the presence of HIV-1 and HIV-2
antigen and antibodies.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to the laboratory personnel responsible for
conducting HIV-1 and HIV-2 antigen and antibody routine screening
in plasma.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
All laboratory technologists and technicians are responsible for
following this SOP. Laboratory supervisors are responsible for
ensuring all staff are trained and adhere to this SOP.
4. DEFINITIONS
HIV-1: Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1 HIV-2: Human
Immunodeficiency Virus type 2 Antigen: A substance that induces an
immune response Antibody: A protein produced by the immune
system in response to an antigen
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes and tips
• Microplate reader (capable of reading absorbance at specified
wavelengths)
• Automated immunoassay analyzer (if applicable)
• HIV-1 and HIV-2 Antigen/Antibody Combo test kit (FDA or CE
marked)
• Plasma separation tubes (PST)
• Gloves, lab coat, and other personal protective equipment (PPE)
6. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Acceptable: EDTA plasma or serum
• Specimen stability: Plasma specimens are stable for up to 7 days
when stored at 2-8°C. Plasma specimens can also be stored
long-term at -20°C or lower for up to 6 months.
• Unacceptable: Specimens that are hemolyzed, lipemic, or
collected in inappropriate anticoagulant tubes
7. PROCEDURE
7.1 Preparation
1. Ensure all reagents and equipment are properly maintained,
calibrated, and at the required temperatures.
2. Put on appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) before
handling specimens or reagents.
3. Label the specimen and reagents appropriately to avoid mix-
ups.
7.2 Sample Processing
1. Upon specimen receipt, verify that the specimen meets the
acceptance criteria.
2. Centrifuge the plasma separation tube (PST) at 1,500-2,000 x g
for 10 minutes.
3. Carefully pipette the supernatant plasma into a properly labeled
secondary tube while avoiding any contact with the cell layer.
7.3 Assay Preparation
1. Allow all reagents and specimens to come to room temperature
(20-25°C) before starting the assay.
2. Prepare the microplate or automated analyzer according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
3. Program the microplate reader or analyzer with the appropriate
parameters as specified by the test kit manufacturer.
7.4 Performing the Assay
1. Add the required volume of plasma specimen to the designated
wells of the microplate or automated analyzer.
2. Add the appropriate reagents (e.g., conjugate, substrate
solution) as required by the test protocol.
3. Incubate the plate or analyzer blocks for the specified time and
temperature as recommended by the manufacturer.
4. Wash the wells according to the kit instructions, if applicable,
ensuring minimal residual volume.
5. Add stop solution upon completion of incubation to halt the
reaction.
7.5 Reading and Interpreting Results
1. Read the microplate absorbance at the required wavelength
using the microplate reader or obtain results from the
automated immunoassay analyzer.
2. Analyze the results according to the manufacturer's
instructions, comparing specimens to control wells to determine
the presence or absence of HIV-1 and HIV-2 antigen and
antibodies.
3. Documentation: The technologist must record the absorbance
values for each well and ensure the validity of controls before
interpreting patient results. Record any relevant observations
during the assay procedure.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Run internal quality control samples (positive and negative
controls) with each batch of specimens.
2. Ensure that all controls are within the specified range before
accepting the batch results.
3. Document all quality control results and corrective actions in the
appropriate log sheets.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Results are automatically transmitted to the LIS or manually
entered by the technologist.
2. Verify and validate all results before releasing them to the
attending clinician.
3. Critical results should be reported immediately to the attending
physician or responsible healthcare provider.
10. REFERENCES
Follow the package insert and instructions provided with the HIV-1
and HIV-2 Antigen/Antibody Combo test kit for specific guidelines.
11. LIMITATIONS
Refer to the test kit manufacturer’s instructions for detailed
information on the limitations of the assay, including potential
interfering substances and the significance of equivocal results.
12. SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS
1. Handle all specimens as potentially infectious.
2. Follow institutional biosafety guidelines, including the proper
disposal of biohazardous waste.
3. Use appropriate PPE to minimize exposure risks.
