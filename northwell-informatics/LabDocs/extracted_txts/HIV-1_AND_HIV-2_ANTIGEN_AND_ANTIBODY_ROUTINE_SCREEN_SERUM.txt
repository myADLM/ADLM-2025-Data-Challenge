STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE
1. PURPOSE
This procedure outlines the steps for generating results for HIV-1
AND HIV-2 antigen and antibody routine screen tests using serum
specimens in the laboratory.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the HIV-1
AND HIV-2 antigen and antibody routine screen tests per this
protocol. All staff members must report any issues to their supervisor
and take necessary corrective actions.
2. SPECIMEN ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
Preferred Specimen:
• Serum obtained from a SST (Serum Separator Tube) or plain red
top tube
• Ideally collected within 24 hours of being received in the lab
• Minimum volume required: 1 mL serum
Unacceptable Specimen Conditions:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples
• Specimens not labeled with patient identifiers
• Specimens received more than 24 hours post collection (without
proper storage conditions)
• Specimens that were inadequately stored or maintained at
incorrect temperatures (i.e., not refrigerated)
Storage:
• Store specimen at 2-8°C if testing cannot be performed
immediately
• Specimens are stable for up to 72 hours at 2-8°C
• If longer storage is needed, freeze specimens at -20°C or lower.
Frozen specimens are stable for up to 3 months.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• HIV-1 and HIV-2 antigen and antibody testing kits (e.g., Enzyme-
linked Immunosorbent Assay - ELISA)
◦ Store kits at 2-8°C and ensure they are within their expiration
date before use
• Micropipettes and tips
• Positive and negative control sera
• Calibrated laboratory timer
• Plate reader (absorbance reader)
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
4. PROCEDURE
Initial Setup:
• Place required ELISA kit components and all control sera at room
temperature for 30 minutes prior to use.
• Label necessary wells on ELISA plates with patient identifiers and
controls.
Testing:
1. Transfer 100 μL of each specimen and control sera into their
respective wells.
2. Seal the plate with provided cover and incubate at 37°C for the
specified time (refer to manufacturer instructions).
3. Wash the plate as instructed by the manufacturer.
4. Add 100 μL of conjugate to each well and re-incubate at 37°C
for the recommended duration.
5. Perform wash steps again as per kit instructions.
6. Add substrate solution to each well (100 μL) and incubate at
room temperature until color change is evident.
7. Stop the reaction by adding 100 μL of stop solution to each well
and reading absorbance at appropriate wavelength immediately
using the plate reader.
Post-Testing:
• Verify and document the results ensuring all controls fell within the
acceptable range.
• Positive control - must react positively
• Negative control - must react negatively
• Patient results above cut-off viewed as reactive; below cut-off as
non-reactive
5. REPORTING RESULTS
Refer to the laboratory's specific reporting guidelines to ensure
accurate transcription of results. Data entry should be reviewed for
any errors prior to patient result reporting.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
Quality control should be performed:
• With each new lot of ELISA kits
• Daily for routine testing (using both positive and negative controls)
Monitor and document any deviations and implement corrections as
required following appropriate procedures.

8. STORAGE AND DISPOSAL
Biohazardous waste, including used ELISA plates, must be disposed
of in accordance with the biohazard waste management protocols to
prevent contamination and ensure compliance with safety standards.
