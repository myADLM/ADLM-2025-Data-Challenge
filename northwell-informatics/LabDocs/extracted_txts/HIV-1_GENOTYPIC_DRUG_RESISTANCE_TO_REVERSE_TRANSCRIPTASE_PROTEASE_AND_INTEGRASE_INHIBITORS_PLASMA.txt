SOP: Analytical Phase for HIV-1 Genotypic Drug Resistance to
Reverse Transcriptase, Protease, and Integrase Inhibitors, Plasma
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedural steps required for the analytical phase
involved in generating reliable and accurate results for HIV-1
genotypic drug resistance testing to reverse transcriptase, protease,
and integrase inhibitors from plasma samples.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory staff are responsible for
ensuring all procedures are followed accurately and results are
documented appropriately. Supervisors must ensure compliance with
the SOP and address any discrepancies identified during the
process.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type: - Plasma
Specimen Volume: - Minimum 2 mL of plasma
Specimen Stability: - Plasma should be separated from whole blood
within 8 hours of collection. - Plasma can be stored at 2-8°C for up to
72 hours if testing is delayed. - For long-term storage, plasma should
be stored at -20°C or lower.
Unacceptable Specimens: - Hemolyzed samples - Specimens that
have been at room temperature for more than 8 hours without being
processed.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
Equipment: - Centrifuge - PCR thermocycler - Electrophoresis
system - Sequencing instrument - Refrigerators and Freezers (-20°C
or lower) - Pipettes and Tips - Biosafety cabinet
Reagents: - RNA extraction kit - Reverse transcriptase-PCT reagents
- Sequencing primers for reverse transcriptase, protease, and
integrase - DNA polymerase - Electrophoresis reagents (e.g.,
agarose, loading dye) - Sequencing reagents (e.g., BigDye®
Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit)
1. PROCEDURE
4.1 RNA Extraction from Plasma: - Thaw frozen plasma samples at
2-8°C. - Use an appropriate RNA extraction kit following the
manufacturer’s guidelines to isolate HIV-1 RNA from 1 mL of plasma.
Process controls in parallel for each assay batch. - Measure and
record RNA concentration using a spectrophotometer.
4.2 Reverse Transcription and PCR Amplification: - Prepare reverse
transcription reagents as recommended by the kit manufacturer. -
Add the isolated RNA into reverse transcription mix. - Follow the
thermal cycling conditions as specified to convert RNA to
complementary DNA (cDNA). - Prepare the PCR amplification
mixture, including specific primers for reverse transcriptase,
protease, and integrase regions. - Perform PCR amplification of
cDNA. Include negative and positive controls. - Verify the
amplification success by running a small aliquot of the PCR products
on an agarose gel and examine under UV light.
4.3 Sequencing: - Purify the PCR products using a PCR purification
kit. - Set up the sequencing reactions using the appropriate
sequencing primers and sequencing reagents. - Perform sequencing
on an automated sequencing instrument. - Analyze the sequencing
data using a computational tool designed for HIV-1 resistance
interpretation.
4.4 Data Analysis and Reporting: - Assemble the sequence reads
using software such as Geneious or BioEdit. - Compare the
sequences with reference strains to identify mutations associated
with drug resistance. - Interpret resistance patterns using established
databases like Stanford HIV Drug Resistance Database. - Document
genotypic resistance to reverse transcriptase, protease, and
integrase inhibitors. - Verify results, ensuring consistency across
replicates and between control and test samples.
4.5 Quality Control: - Run controls with each batch to monitor
extraction, amplification, and sequencing consistency. - Record
temperatures and conditions of equipment regularly. - Validate each
run with appropriate internal and external controls. - Review QC data
periodically to ensure consistent performance.
4.6 Result Reporting: - Enter validated results into Laboratory
Information System (LIS). - Ensure all reports are reviewed and
signed off by a designated supervisory staff. - Communicate critical
resistance results to the ordering physician promptly following
approved communication protocols.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
◦ The sensitivity of the assay may be affected by low viral
load.
◦ Some minority viral populations may not be detected by
sequencing.
◦ Ensure thorough knowledge of current HIV genotyping and
drug resistance databases to accurately interpret results.
