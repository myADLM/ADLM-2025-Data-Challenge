STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE
HIV-1/HIV-2 ANTIBODIES + P24 ANTIGEN COMBINATION
IMMUNOASSAY (4TH GENERATION)
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized method for the detection of HIV-1/HIV-2
antibodies and the P24 antigen in human serum or plasma using the
4th generation combination immunoassay. This method improves
early detection of HIV infection by identifying both the antigen and
antibodies.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory personnel trained in immunoassay techniques
are responsible for performing this procedure. It is the responsibility
of the laboratory supervisor to ensure all personnel are trained and
that quality control measures are implemented and adhered to.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred Specimen:
• Serum or plasma (EDTA, heparin, or citrate as anticoagulant).
• Collected in appropriate specimen collection tubes.
Specimen Stability:
• Store specimens at 2-8°C if tested within 7 days.
• For longer storage, freeze specimens at -20°C or colder.
• Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, icteric, or contaminated specimens.
• Specimens collected in sodium fluoride.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Automated immunoassay analyzer (e.g., Abbott Architect, Roche
Cobas e411).
• Pipettes and tips.
• Centrifuge.
Reagents and Supplies:
• HIV-1/HIV-2 Antibodies + P24 Antigen Combo Assay Kit.
• Quality control materials (positive and negative controls).
• Specimen collection tubes.
• Disposable gloves and personal protective equipment.
5. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Allow all reagents, controls, and specimens to reach room
temperature (18-25°C) before analysis.
2. Verify that all reagents are within their expiration dates.
Operation:
1. Calibrate the Analyzer:
◦ Perform instrument calibration as per the manufacturer's
recommendations.
◦ Use calibrators provided by the assay kit. Follow the
calibration procedure specific to the immunoassay analyzer.
2. Quality Control:
◦ Analyze the quality control materials (positive and negative
controls) before each batch of samples.
◦ Ensure QC results are within the acceptable range specified
by the manufacturer. Document all QC results.
3. Specimen Analysis:
◦ Load sample tubes into the immunoassay analyzer
according to the instrument’s specifications.
◦ Select the HIV-1/HIV-2 Antibodies + P24 Antigen Cocktails
assay protocol on the analyzer.
◦ Input necessary data including patient identifiers.
◦ Start the analysis run according to the instrument's
instructions.
4. Interpretation of Results:
◦ The analyzer will provide the results as reactive or non-
reactive based on the cutoff values set by the manufacturer.
◦ Reactive results indicate the presence of HIV-1/HIV-2
antibodies or P24 antigen.
◦ Non-reactive results suggest no detectable HIV-1/HIV-2
antibodies or P24 antigen.
Result Confirmation:
• Confirmatory testing should be performed on all reactive samples
using a supplemental assay (e.g., HIV-1/HIV-2 differentiation
immunoassay, Western blot, or NAT).
6. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Review all results for QC compliance before reporting.
2. Validate results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
3. For reactive results, report as "HIV-1/HIV-2 antibodies and/or
P24 antigen detected, pending confirmatory testing.”
4. Non-reactive results are reported as "HIV-1/HIV-2 antibodies
and P24 antigen not detected."
5. Notify the appropriate healthcare provider immediately for all
reactive results following laboratory protocol for critical value
notification.
6. Follow site-specific guidelines for reporting results.
7. QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE
1. Internal Quality Control:
◦ Run positive and negative controls with each assay batch.
◦ Record the results and take corrective actions for any
deviations.
2. External Quality Assessment:
◦ Participate in external proficiency testing programs
periodically.
◦ Compare results with peer laboratories to ensure accuracy
and reliability.

9. DOCUMENTATION
• Maintain records of all calibrations, quality control runs, and
specimen results in accordance with laboratory policy.

the assay procedure.
10. REVIEW AND REVISION
This SOP should be reviewed annually or as needed based on
updates to the assay, instrumentation, or regulatory requirements. All
revisions should be documented and approved by the laboratory
supervisor.
