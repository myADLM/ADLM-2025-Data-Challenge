Standard Operating Procedure: HIV-1/HIV-2 RNA Detection,
Plasma
1. PURPOSE
This SOP describes the process for the detection of HIV-1 and HIV-2
RNA in plasma specimens using a nucleic acid amplification
technique. This protocol ensures proper handling, processing, and
analysis of specimens to maintain accuracy and reliability of test
results.
2. SCOPE
This procedure is applicable to all trained laboratory personnel
responsible for performing the HIV-1/HIV-2 RNA detection test. The
test is designed for use with plasma specimens from individuals
being tested for HIV infection.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of qualified laboratory personnel to perform the
HIV-1/HIV-2 RNA detection test, document findings accurately, and
report results in a timely manner. Laboratory supervisors are
responsible for ensuring that personnel are adequately trained and
that all equipment and reagents are maintained according to
manufacturer's specifications.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
- **Specimen Type:** Plasma
- **Collection Tubes:** EDTA-treated blood collection tubes
- **Specimen Volume:** Minimum of 2 mL plasma
- **Stability:**
- Room Temperature: Up to 24 hours
- Refrigerated (2-8°C): Up to 72 hours
- Frozen (-70°C or lower): Indefinitely
Unacceptable Specimens: - Plasma specimens with significant
hemolysis - Specimens collected in anticoagulants other than EDTA -
Specimens that are not handled according to the stability
requirements
5. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
- Nucleic acid extraction kit
- PCR amplification kit specific for HIV-1/HIV-2 RNA detection
- Real-time PCR instrument
- Pipettes and pipette tips with aerosol barrier
- Centrifuge
- Vortex mixer
- Biohazard disposal containers
- Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
6. PROCEDURE
6.1. Specimen Processing
1. Upon receipt, verify that specimen identification matches the accompanying requisition form.
2. Centrifuge the EDTA blood collection tube at 1,500 x g for 10 minutes at room temperature.
3. Carefully transfer the plasma to a clean microcentrifuge tube, avoiding the buffy coat and red cells.
4. Store the plasma at -70°C if it cannot be tested immediately.
6.2. Nucleic Acid Extraction
1. Thaw frozen specimens at room temperature and vortex briefly.
2. Follow the nucleic acid extraction kit instructions to extract RNA from 1 mL of plasma.
3. Elute the RNA in the appropriate volume of elution buffer as specified by the kit manufacturer.
6.3. Real-Time PCR Amplification
1. Set up the PCR reaction according to the PCR amplification kit instructions.
- Include negative and positive control reactions.
2. Prepare the reaction mix by combining the master mix, primers, probes, and extracted RNA.
3. Dispense the reaction mix into a PCR plate or tubes.
4. Place the PCR plate or tubes into the real-time PCR instrument.
5. Program the real-time PCR instrument with the appropriate cycling conditions as per the manufacturer's instructions.
6.4. Data Analysis and Interpretation
1. After PCR amplification, analyze the results using the software provided with the real-time PCR instrument.
2. Evaluate the amplification curves of the negative and positive controls to validate the run.
3. Interpret the results of the patient specimens based on the presence or absence of amplification curves corresponding to HIV-1 or HIV-2 RNA.
- Positive Result: Detectable amplification curve within the specified cycle threshold (Ct) range.
- Negative Result: No detectable amplification curve within the specified Ct range.
- Invalid Result: Improper control reactions or ambiguous patient results require retesting.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
- Run positive and negative controls with each batch of specimens to ensure test accuracy.
- Internal controls should be included in each reaction to monitor for potential inhibitors.
- Document all control results and take corrective actions if controls do not perform as expected.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
2. Results should be verified by a licensed technologist before reporting.
3. Report results to the requesting clinician or healthcare provider as per laboratory protocol.
9. MAINTENANCE AND CALIBRATION
- Ensure regular maintenance and calibration of the real-time PCR instrument as recommended by the manufacturer.
- Keep records of maintenance, calibrations, and any service performed on the equipment.

11. TROUBLESHOOTING
- If positive and negative controls fail, repeat the test with fresh reagents and controls.
- If repeated issues occur, contact technical support for the PCR instrument or reagent manufacturer.
