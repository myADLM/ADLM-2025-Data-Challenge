Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for HIV-1/HIV-2 RNA
DETECTION PRENATAL, PLASMA
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for the detection of HIV-1 and HIV-2 RNA in
prenatal plasma samples using real-time polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR). This protocol ensures precise, accurate, and timely results
delivery for the ongoing care and management of prenatal patients.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel involved in performing
HIV-1/HIV-2 RNA detection tests on prenatal plasma samples.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory personnel to carry
out the procedure as detailed in this SOP. Laboratory supervisors are
responsible for ensuring personnel are adequately trained and for
monitoring compliance with this SOP.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Prenatal plasma
• Collection: Plasma should be separated from whole blood
collected in EDTA tubes. Blood should be processed within 4
hours of collection.
• Volume: Minimum 1 mL of plasma
• Storage and Stability: Plasma can be stored at 2-8°C for up to 48
hours. For longer storage, freeze at -70°C or colder.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• RT-PCR Instrument (validated for HIV-1/HIV-2 RNA detection)
• Compatible RT-PCR Kits for HIV-1/HIV-2 RNA detection
• Microcentrifuge tubes
• RNA extraction kit
• Pipettes and filtered tips
• PPE: Gloves, lab coat, and safety glasses
• Biohazard waste containers
6. PROCEDURE
A. RNA Extraction:
1. Thaw frozen plasma samples on ice.
2. Briefly centrifuge the samples to remove any precipitates.
3. Allocate the required volume of plasma (typically 0.5-1 mL) into
a clean microcentrifuge tube.
4. Use the RNA extraction kit to isolate HIV-1/HIV-2 RNA from the
plasma, following the manufacturer’s instructions.
5. Elute the RNA in the provided elution buffer and store on ice or
at -70°C until use.
B. RT-PCR Setup:
1. Prepare the RT-PCR reaction mix according to the kit’s
specifications, including the master mix, primers/probes, and
any necessary controls.
2. Add the extracted RNA to the reaction mix, ensuring the final
reaction volume aligns with the manufacturer’s instructions.
3. Include appropriate controls (positive control, negative control,
no-template control) in each run.
C. Running the RT-PCR:
1. Load the prepared reaction mix into the RT-PCR instrument.
2. Follow the instrument’s initialization and run protocols for HIV-1/
HIV-2 RNA detection.
3. Set the thermal cycling parameters as per the kit guidelines.
4. Start the run on the RT-PCR instrument.
D. Data Analysis:
1. Once the RT-PCR run is complete, analyze the data using the
software provided with the instrument.
2. Assess the results for all controls to ensure the validity of the
run.
3. Identify samples as positive or negative for HIV-1/HIV-2 RNA
based on the fluorescence threshold (Ct value) provided in the
kit’s instructions.
7. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
• Positive: Presence of HIV-1/HIV-2 RNA indicated by a Ct value
within the specified range.
• Negative: Absence of HIV-1/HIV-2 RNA, no amplification detected
or Ct value beyond the acceptable range.
• Invalid: If controls fail or results are ambiguous, repeat the assay.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform daily quality controls using known positive and negative
samples to ensure the RT-PCR system is functioning correctly.
• Document all quality control results and investigate any deviations
from expected results.
• Run an external proficiency test periodically as mandated by
regulatory bodies.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Review and verify results by a qualified technologist before
releasing.
• Report critical values immediately to the attending physician as
per laboratory protocol.
10. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions for the HIV-1/HIV-2 RNA detection RT-
PCR kit.

11. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS
• Handle all specimens as potentially infectious material.
• Wear appropriate PPE at all times.
• Dispose of all biological waste in accordance with biohazard
waste disposal regulations.
12. DOCUMENTATION
• Maintain a record of all performed tests, including date, time,
operator’s initials, sample identification, and results.
• Document any deviations from the SOP and corrective actions
taken.
