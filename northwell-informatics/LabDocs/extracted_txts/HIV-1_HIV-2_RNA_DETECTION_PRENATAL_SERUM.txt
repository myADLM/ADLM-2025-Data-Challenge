Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) for HIV-1/HIV-2
RNA Detection Prenatal, Serum
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the detection of HIV-1 and
HIV-2 RNA in prenatal serum samples to ensure accurate and
reliable results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
• Designated laboratory technologists are responsible for
performing the RNA detection tests.
• It is the responsibility of all laboratory staff to ensure quality
control and adherence to the procedure.
• Supervisors are responsible for reviewing and verifying test
results and taking appropriate corrective actions when necessary.
3. DEFINITION
HIV-1/HIV-2 RNA Detection: A molecular test used to detect RNA
from human immunodeficiency viruses type 1 and type 2, which
cause HIV infection.
4. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Requirements
• Specimen Type: Serum
• Volume Required: Minimum of 2 mL of serum
B. Sample Preparation
1. Specimen Collection: Collect the sample using standard
venipuncture technique.
2. Labeling: Ensure the sample is properly labeled with patient
identification and date/time of collection.
3. Storage: Keep the sample refrigerated at 2-8°C if not
processed immediately. The serum should be processed within
24 hours of collection to maintain RNA integrity.
C. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies
• Real-time PCR instrument
• RNA extraction kit
• HIV-1/HIV-2 RNA detection kit
• Calibrated micropipettes
• Nuclease-free tubes
• Personal protective equipment (gloves, lab coat, eye protection)
D. RNA Extraction
1. Preparation:
◦ Thaw the serum sample at room temperature.
◦ Vortex gently to mix the sample well before performing the
extraction.
2. Extraction Process:
◦ Follow the RNA extraction kit's manufacturer instructions.
◦ Ensure the yield and quality of RNA by measuring the
absorbance at 260 nm and 280 nm using a
spectrophotometer.
◦ Store the extracted RNA at -80°C until further analysis.
E. Real-time PCR Setup
1. Reagents Preparation:
◦ Thaw all reagents, master mix, primers, and probes on ice.
◦ Prepare the PCR master mix according to the detection kit
instructions.
2. Plate Setup:
◦ Load 20 µL of master mix into each well of the PCR plate.
◦ Add 5 µL of extracted RNA into the designated wells.
◦ Include positive control, negative control, and no-template
control (NTC) in each run.
3. Sealing and Loading:
◦ Seal the plate with optical adhesive film.
◦ Briefly centrifuge the plate to ensure the mixture is at the
bottom of the wells.
◦ Load the plate into the real-time PCR instrument.
F. Running the PCR
1. Programming:
◦ Set up the PCR program as per the manufacturer's protocol,
including initial denaturation, annealing, and extension
cycles.
2. Run PCR:
◦ Start the PCR run ensuring that all parameters and controls
are correct.
G. Data Analysis
1. Review Results:
◦ Analyze the PCR data using the instrument's software.
◦ Verify that controls are within acceptable ranges.
2. Interpretation:
◦ Determine the presence or absence of HIV-1/HIV-2 RNA
based on Ct (Cycle threshold) values.
◦ Negative result: Ct value greater than the predefined cutoff.
◦ Positive result: Ct value less than or equal to the predefined
cutoff.
H. Quality Control
• Perform internal quality control using known positive and negative
serum samples.
• Run quality controls in parallel with patient samples for each
batch.
• Document the results of the quality controls in the QC logbook.
I. Reporting Results
1. Documentation:
◦ Record the findings in the laboratory information system
(LIS).
◦ Attach raw data printouts including amplification curves and
Ct values where applicable.
2. Verification:
◦ Supervisors review and verify the results before final
reporting.
◦ Any discrepancies should be investigated and resolved
before reporting the final result.
3. Report Delivery:
◦ Transmit the finalized reports to the relevant healthcare
provider.
◦ Ensure confidentiality and data integrity during the
transmission.
J. Method Limitations
• Refer to the RNA detection kit insert for limitations related to
specific reagents and instruments used in the test.
