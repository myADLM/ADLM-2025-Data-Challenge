1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is to
outline the protocol for the analytical phase of generating results for
HIV-1/HIV-2 RNA detection in serum samples. This SOP ensures
accurate and reliable results and complies with CLIA requirements.
Responsibility:
• It is the responsibility of designated laboratory staff to follow this
SOP for the detection and quantification of HIV-1/HIV-2 RNA in
serum samples.
• It is the responsibility of all staff to identify any deficiencies in the
process which may affect laboratory test results and bring them to
the attention of a supervisor.
• Supervisors must ensure that all staff are trained and adhere to
this SOP, including implementation of corrective actions when
necessary.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type: Serum Collection Container: Sterile serum separator
tube (SST) Volume: Minimum 1 mL Stability: Specimens are stable
for up to 72 hours at 2-8°C. For prolonged storage, specimens should
be frozen at -20°C or lower.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed specimens
• Specimen volume less than 1 mL
• Specimens not clearly labeled with collection date and time
• Specimens stored at room temperature for more than 8 hours
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• Real-Time PCR Instrument (e.g., LightCycler®, ABI Prism®)
• HIV-1/HIV-2 RNA detection kit (approved and verified for
laboratory use)
• Pipettes and sterile pipette tips
• Microcentrifuge tubes
• Refrigerators/freezers for specimen storage
• RNA extraction kit (approved and verified for laboratory use)
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
1. PROCEDURE
A) Specimen Preparation
1. Ensure serum specimen has been properly stored and labeled.
2. Thaw frozen specimens at room temperature if applicable.
3. Mix specimens gently by inversion; avoid vigorous shaking that
may cause frothing.
B) RNA Extraction
1. Follow manufacturer instructions for the RNA extraction kit.
2. Pipette a specified volume of serum into a microcentrifuge tube.
3. Add appropriate reagents for RNA lysis and binding as per kit
protocol.
4. Perform wash steps to remove contaminants.
5. Elute RNA with the provided elution buffer (typically RNase-free
water or buffer).
6. Store extracted RNA at -20°C or continue with amplification
immediately.
C) Real-Time PCR Amplification
1. Prepare master mix reagents according to the instructions for
the HIV-1/HIV-2 RNA detection kit.
2. Add extracted RNA samples to the master mix.
3. Include appropriate controls (positive control, negative control,
and no template control) to validate the run.
4. Load samples and controls into the designated wells of the
PCR plate.
5. Program the Real-Time PCR instrument according to the kit
instructions, including cycling parameters.
6. Start the PCR run and monitor the reaction progress.
D) Result Interpretation
1. Analyze the amplification curves generated by the Real-Time
PCR instrument.
2. Determine the presence or absence of HIV-1/HIV-2 RNA based
on threshold cycles (Ct values) established in kit
documentation.
3. Validate the results against control reactions:
◦ Positive control must show amplification.
◦ Negative control and no template control must show no
amplification.
E) Troubleshooting
1. If the positive control fails, check reagent preparation and
instrument settings, then repeat the test.
2. If there is unexpected amplification in negative or no template
controls, perform contamination assessment and
decontaminate work area before repeating the test.
3. Document any corrective actions taken.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
A) Internal Controls
1. Quality control samples must be run with each batch of patient
samples.
2. Maintain records of control sample results to track assay
performance over time.
B) External Controls
1. Participate in regular proficiency testing programs as required
by CLIA guidelines.
2. Compare results with peer laboratories to identify any
discrepancies and resolve issues.
3. REPORTING RESULTS
A) Data Entry
1. Enter validated results into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
2. Ensure results are reviewed and verified by a qualified
technologist before reporting.
B) Critical Results
1. Report critical results immediately to the ordering physician.
2. Document the communication of critical results in the LIS.
C) Data Storage
1. Store all analytical data in compliance with laboratory data
management policies.
2. Ensure all documentation related to each test run is preserved
for regulatory review.
