HIV-1 Phenotype Referral Laboratory
1. PURPOSE
To provide an accurate and reliable method for the generation of
results for HIV-1 phenotype testing.
Responsibility:
Designated staff are responsible for following and documenting the
procedures as described. It is the responsibility of the laboratory
supervisor to ensure compliance with the protocol and to review
results for accuracy before final reporting.
DEFINITIONS
Phenotypic assay: A laboratory test used to measure the
susceptibility of the HIV-1 virus to antiretroviral drugs.
EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, SUPPLIES
• Centrifuge
• Biosafety Cabinet
• Class II or higher
• CO2 Incubator
• Micropipettes and tips (sterile)
• Sterile flasks, tubes, and containers
• HIV-1 virus culture
• Cell lines
• Growth medium
• Antiretroviral drugs
• Reagents and controls
• Temperature Control devices
PROCEDURE
1. Virus Culture Preparation A) Thaw previously frozen HIV-1
isolate according to laboratory SOP. B) Prepare sufficient
aliquots of virus culture for testing.
2. Patient Sample Preparation A) Thaw patient plasma samples
within a Biosafety Cabinet. B) Aliquot samples for immediate
testing. Any unused portions should be stored appropriately.
3. Cell Line Preparation A) Use appropriate cell lines for HIV-1
culture. B) Ensure cells are at proper confluency and viability
before inoculation. C) Seed cells in appropriate flask or plates
based on assay volume.
4. Infection of Cell Lines A) Inoculate cell lines with HIV-1 virus
isolates (including patient and control strains). B) Include both
positive (resistant virus) and negative controls (wild-type virus).
5. Drug Susceptibility Testing A) Prepare concentration gradient of
antiretroviral drugs. B) Add drugs to the respective wells
containing infected cells. C) Incubate the plate/flask in CO2
incubator for the specified duration, monitoring cell health.
6. Monitoring and Harvesting A) Monitor cytopathic effect through
microscopic evaluation. B) Harvest supernatants at the end of
incubation for p24 antigen testing or other viral replication
measurement.
7. Data Analysis A) Quantify the level of viral replication in each
well using a p24 ELISA or other appropriate assay. B) Calculate
the inhibitory concentration 50% (IC50) for each antiretroviral
drug by plotting drug concentration against the level of viral
replication. Prepare a dose-response curve.
8. Quality Control A) Include internal quality control measures
(e.g., reproducibility and accuracy of IC50 results). B) Quality
control material should be analyzed repeatedly to track assay
performance. C) Maintain a log of quality control results and
take appropriate corrective action if out-of-specification results
are noted.
9. Reporting Results A) Record and review all data for accuracy.
B) The report should detail the phenotypic resistance profile,
including IC50 values compared to reference limits. C) Highlight
any anomalies or discrepancies for supervisory review.
Quality Assurance:
• Ensure reagents are validated and within expiration date.
• Bi-annual proficiency testing should be undertaken to ensure
compliance to standards.
• Routinely calibrate equipment as per manufacturer specifications.

LIMITATIONS
• Test performance is dependent on the quality and integrity of the
virus and cell cultures.
• Variability in virus mutation or sample handling may influence the
sensitivity of results.
This protocol ensures that the generated results from the HIV-1
Phenotype core are consistent, reliable, and accurate, maintaining
the highest standards set in laboratory practices.
