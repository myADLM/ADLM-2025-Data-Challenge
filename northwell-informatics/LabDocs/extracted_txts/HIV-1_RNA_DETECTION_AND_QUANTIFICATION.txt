Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
HIV-1 RNA Detection and Quantification
1. PURPOSE
This SOP provides detailed instructions for the detection and
quantification of HIV-1 RNA in human plasma using a nucleic acid
amplification test (NAAT). This is essential for the diagnosis,
monitoring, and treatment management of HIV-1 infected individuals.
Responsibility:
• It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory technician or
technologist to perform the analysis.
• It is the responsibility of the laboratory supervisor to ensure that
all procedures are followed and documented accurately.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all personnel involved in the testing and
reporting of HIV-1 RNA levels in the laboratory.
3. DEFINITION
• HIV-1 RNA: The ribonucleic acid of human immunodeficiency
virus type 1.
• LOD (Limit of Detection): The lowest amount of HIV-1 RNA that
can be differentiated from the absence of HIV-1 RNA.
• LOQ (Limit of Quantification): The lowest amount of HIV-1 RNA
that can be quantified with acceptable precision and accuracy.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Real-Time PCR Instrument (e.g., Roche COBAS® TaqMan®)
• Automated RNA extraction system (e.g., Roche COBAS®
AmpliPrep)
• HIV-1 RNA test kits including calibrators and controls
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
• Micropipettes and appropriate tips
• RNase-free tubes and consumables
• Refrigerators and freezers for storage of reagents and samples
5. PROCEDURE
A) Specimen Preparation:
• Specimen Requirements: Plasma collected in EDTA tubes.
• Specimen Handling:
◦ Centrifuge blood samples at 800-1600 x g for 15-20 minutes at
room temperature.
◦ Aliquot plasma into RNase-free tubes.
◦ Store plasma samples at -20°C or lower if they are not
processed immediately.
B) Equipment Preparation:
• Ensure all equipment is calibrated and validated.
• Clean all work surfaces with RNase decontamination solution
before starting the procedure.
• Prepare the PCR area to prevent cross-contamination, including
the use of separate locations for reagent preparation, extraction,
and amplification.
C) RNA Extraction:
• Follow the automated extraction process as outlined in the
manufacturer’s manual.
• Use internal quality controls included in the extraction kits to
monitor extraction efficiency.
• After extraction, transfer the RNA extracts into RNase-free
storage tubes and keep on ice or at 4°C until further processing.
D) PCR Setup:
• Thaw reagents and RNA samples on ice.
• Prepare the master mix according to the manufacturer’s
instructions, including appropriate volumes for the PCR reaction
mixture and controls.
• Aliquot the master mix into PCR tubes or plates.
• Add extracted RNA samples, calibrators, and quality controls to
their respective wells/tubes.
E) PCR Amplification:
• Load the prepared PCR tubes/plate into the Real-Time PCR
instrument.
• Program the PCR instrument with the cycling conditions specified
by the assay manufacturer.
• Begin the PCR run and monitor the process through the
instrument’s software.
F) Data Analysis:
• After the run, analyze the data using the instrument software as
per the manufacturer's guidelines.
• Verify that all controls meet acceptance criteria.
• Quantify HIV-1 RNA levels in the unknown samples using the
standard curve generated by the calibrators.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run positive and negative controls with each batch of specimens
to ensure reliability.
• Perform internal and external proficiency testing regularly.
• Document all control results and take corrective action if controls
fall outside predetermined limits.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
• Record quantitative results in the laboratory information system
(LIS).
• Report the results to the requesting healthcare provider, including
any pertinent comments on sample integrity or special findings.
• Follow site-specific guidelines for result validation and critical
result reporting.
8. LIMITATIONS
• The sensitivity of the test may be affected by improper specimen
collection, handling, or storage.
• Interference from other substances present in the plasma.
• Ensure strict adherence to kit manufacturer instructions and
laboratory standards to minimize errors.
