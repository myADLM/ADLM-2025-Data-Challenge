Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for HIV-1 RNA Detection
and Quantification, Plasma
1. Purpose:
The purpose of this procedure is to outline the steps for the
detection and quantification of HIV-1 RNA in plasma samples
using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR). This protocol is intended to ensure accurate,
reliable, and reproducible results.
2. Scope:
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel who are
trained and authorized to perform molecular testing for HIV-1
RNA detection and quantification.
3. Responsibility:
◦ Authorized personnel are responsible for performing the
HIV-1 RNA detection and quantification according to this
SOP.
◦ Laboratory supervisors are responsible for ensuring that
staff are adequately trained and adhere to the SOP.
◦ Quality assurance personnel are responsible for monitoring
compliance with this SOP and ensuring quality control
measures are in place.
4. Specimen Requirements:
◦ Type: Plasma collected in EDTA tubes.
◦ Volume: Minimum of 1.0 mL of plasma.
◦ Storage: Plasma should be stored at -70°C if not tested
immediately.
◦ Stability: Plasma samples are stable for up to 6 hours at
2-8°C and for up to 6 months at -70°C.
5. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies:
◦ Real-time PCR instrument (e.g., ABI 7500, Roche Cobas
TaqMan)
◦ Viral RNA extraction kit (e.g., Qiagen QIAamp Viral RNA
Mini Kit)
◦ HIV-1 RNA quantification kit (e.g., Roche Cobas TaqMan
HIV-1 Test)
◦ PCR tubes or plates
◦ Pipettes and sterile, RNase-free pipette tips
◦ Personal protective equipment (PPE)
6. Procedure:
A. RNA Extraction:
1. Thaw plasma samples on ice and centrifuge at 1,500 x g
for 10 minutes at 4°C to remove any cellular debris.
2. Transfer the supernatant to a new microcentrifuge tube.
3. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for the viral RNA
extraction kit to isolate RNA from the plasma samples.
4. Elute the RNA in a final volume of 50 µL of RNase-free
water.
5. Store the extracted RNA on ice if proceeding immediately
to the next step, or at -70°C for longer storage.
B. RT-PCR Setup:
1. Prepare the RT-PCR master mix according to the HIV-1
RNA quantification kit instructions.
2. Add the required amount of extracted RNA to the PCR
tubes or plates containing the master mix.
3. Include positive and negative controls with each batch of
samples to monitor the performance of the assay.
C. PCR Amplification:
1. Load the PCR tubes or plates into the real-time PCR
instrument.
2. Program the thermal cycler according to the HIV-1 RNA
quantification kit instructions, typically involving:
▪ Reverse transcription at 50-55°C for 30-60 minutes
▪ Initial denaturation at 95°C for 10 minutes
▪ 40-45 cycles of:
▪ Denaturation at 95°C for 15-30 seconds
▪ Annealing/extension at 60°C for 30-60 seconds
D. Result Interpretation:
1. After the PCR run is completed, analyze the data using
the software associated with the real-time PCR
instrument.
2. Quantify the viral RNA by comparing the Ct values of the
samples to the standard curve generated using known
concentrations of HIV-1 RNA standards.
E. Quality Control:
1. Daily run positive and negative controls to ensure the
accuracy and precision of the assay.
2. If controls fail, troubleshoot the assay according to the
manufacturer's guidelines and repeat the run.
7. Reporting Results:
◦ Results are automatically transmitted to the Laboratory
Information System (LIS) and must be reviewed and verified
by a technologist.
◦ Report results as copies/mL of HIV-1 RNA.
◦ Critical results (e.g., unexpected high viral loads) must be
reviewed and verified by a senior technologist and reported
to the physician.
8. Method Limitations:
◦ Ensure no contamination of samples as PCR assays are
highly sensitive.
◦ Presence of PCR inhibitors in the plasma sample may affect
the accuracy of the results.
9. References:
◦ Manufacturer's instructions for the HIV-1 RNA quantification
kit.
◦ Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI)
guidelines for molecular diagnostic testing.
