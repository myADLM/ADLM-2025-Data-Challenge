STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP) FOR HIV-1 RNA
DETECTION AND QUANTIFICATION, PRENATAL, PLASMA
1. PURPOSE This procedure outlines the analytical phase
protocol for the detection and quantification of HIV-1 RNA in
prenatal plasma samples using a certified nucleic acid
amplification test (NAAT) method.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory staff are responsible for
performing the procedure, analyzing the test results, and ensuring
the accuracy and reliability of the results. The supervisor is
responsible for overseeing the process and addressing any issues
that arise.
1. DEFINITION HIV-1 RNA DETECTION AND QUANTIFICATION
is a sensitive molecular diagnostic test aimed at identifying and
measuring the amount of HIV-1 RNA in plasma. The test is
pivotal for monitoring HIV-1 infection in pregnant individuals to
optimize clinical management and prenatal care.
2. PROCEDURE
A) Sample Preparation:
• Verify patient information and specimen type upon receipt.
• Ensure plasma samples are properly stored and handled before
analysis.
• Acceptable Samples: Plasma separated within 6 hours of
collection, stored at 2-8°C or frozen at -70°C if delayed beyond
this period. Specimens must be well-labeled with collection date
and patient identifiers.
B) Reagents and Supplies:
• HIV-1 RNA Detection and Quantification Kit (FDA-approved/CE-
marked)
• NAAT equipment (analyzer and thermocycler)
• Pipettes and sterile tips
• Nuclease-free microcentrifuge tubes and reaction vessels
• Positive and negative control materials
• RNA extraction reagents
C) RNA Extraction:
1. Thaw plasma samples on ice, if frozen.
2. Vortex samples for 5 seconds.
3. Prepare the extraction reagents according to the kit
instructions.
4. Aliquot the appropriate volume of plasma for extraction.
5. Perform RNA extraction using the provided reagents and
protocol, ensuring all steps are conducted in a clean
environment to avoid contamination.
6. Elute extracted RNA and store at 4°C for immediate use or
freeze at -70°C for later use.
D) Amplification and Detection:
1. Set up the amplification reaction by mixing extracted RNA with
specific primers, probes, and master mix according to the kit's
instructions.
2. Dispense the reaction mixture into the appropriate wells/
platform on the NAAT equipment.
3. Add positive and negative controls to designated wells.
4. Initiate the amplification run on the NAAT equipment following
the manufacturer's protocol (typically PCR).
5. Program the thermocycler with specified cycling conditions.
6. Monitor the amplification process; specialized software will
perform real-time quantification of HIV-1 RNA.
E) Result Interpretation:
1. Review the amplification data:
◦ Positive Control: Must show definitive amplification curve.
◦ Negative Control: Must show no amplification.
◦ Patient Samples: Evaluate amplification curves and
quantification data.
2. Determine RNA concentration from the standard curve and
software outputs.
3. Record results in the laboratory information system (LIS).
F) Quality Control:
• Perform daily equipment checks and calibration.
• Utilize proper controls in every run to ensure validity.
• Review quality control material results and take corrective action if
controls fail.
• Follow standard QC procedures to accept or reject runs.
G) Reporting Results:
1. Results are automatically transmitted to the LIS after
verification by technologist.
2. Critical results require immediate communication to the
healthcare provider.
3. Ensure complete documentation of all sample runs, control
outcomes, and any troubleshooting performed.
Reference Intervals: Based on kit insert and clinical guidelines.
Method Limitations: Refer to the specific kit insert for individual
reagent limitations and potential interferences.
