Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for HIV-1 RNA Quantification in
Patient Plasma
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to define the procedures and steps for the
quantification of HIV-1 RNA in patient plasma samples to monitor HIV
disease progression or treatment efficacy. This assay involves the
use of real-time PCR technology to determine the viral load in the
plasma of HIV-1 positive patients.
Responsibility:
The analytical process must be performed by qualified laboratory
personnel trained in molecular diagnostic techniques, following all
applicable safety and procedural guidelines. It is the responsibility of
all staff to adhere to this SOP and report any deviations or issues to
the laboratory supervisor.
1. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all personnel involved in the viral load testing of
HIV-1 RNA in patient plasma samples from receipt to result
interpretation and includes preparation, extraction, amplification, and
documentation of results.
1. DEFINITIONS
HIV-1 RNA: Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1 Ribonucleic Acid.
RT-PCR: Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction. VL:
Viral Load.
1. PERSONNEL QUALIFICATIONS
All laboratory personnel performing this test must have:
• Certification in molecular diagnostic techniques.
• Training in the operation of PCR instruments and related
software.
• Familiarity with biosafety procedures for handling infectious
specimens.
1. MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT
• Equipment:
◦ Real-time PCR machine
◦ Biosafety Cabinet (Class II)
◦ Centrifuge
◦ Micropipettes and sterile tips
◦ Vortex mixer
◦ Thermal cycler
• Reagents and supplies:
◦ HIV-1 RNA extraction kit
◦ Reverse Transcription reagents
◦ Master mix with Taqman probes specific for HIV-1 RNA
◦ Nuclease-free water
◦ Positive control RNA
◦ Negative control (Nuclease-free water or HIV-negative
plasma)
◦ PCR tubes/plates
◦ Patient plasma samples
1. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Collection and Preparation:
1. Collect blood samples in EDTA tubes and process to separate
plasma by centrifugation at 800-1000 x g for 10 minutes.
2. Transfer the plasma to sterile cryovials using aseptic
techniques and store at -80°C until testing.
3. Thaw plasma samples on ice before starting the extraction
process.
B. RNA Extraction:
1. Follow the specific protocols of the HIV-1 RNA extraction kit for
plasma samples.
2. Ensure all reagents are prepared as per the manufacturer's
instructions and at the appropriate working temperature.
3. Add the appropriate volumes of lysis buffer and binding buffer
to the plasma samples, followed by a brief vortex.
4. Proceed through binding, washing, and elution steps as
described in the extraction kit manual.
5. Elute RNA into a final volume appropriate for your assay
(usually 50 uL).
C. Reverse Transcription and Real-Time PCR Amplification:
1. Prepare the RT-PCR master mix as recommended by the
supplier with components for reverse transcription and
amplification.
2. Include TaqMan probe/primers specific for HIV-1 RNA in the
master mix.
3. Aliquot 15 µL of the master mix into each well of the PCR plate
or tube.
4. Add 5 µL of extracted RNA to the respective wells.
5. Add appropriate controls: 5 µL of positive control RNA and 5 µL
of nuclease-free water (negative control).
6. Seal the PCR plate with suitable adhesive film or caps.
D. RT-PCR Cycling Conditions:
1. Load the plate into the real-time PCR machine.
2. Set up the run protocol as follows:
◦ Reverse Transcription: 50°C for 15 minutes.
◦ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 2 minutes.
◦ PCR cycling (40 cycles):
▪ Denaturation: 95°C for 15 seconds
▪ Annealing/Extension: 60°C for 1 minute
3. Ensure the specific fluorescence channels for TaqMan probes
are selected.
E. Data Analysis and Reporting:
1. Following the completion of the PCR run, collect and analyze
the data.
2. Determine the crossing threshold (Ct) values for each sample.
3. Calculate the viral load of HIV-1 RNA using the calibration curve
established with the positive controls.
4. Validate the run by checking that control values fall within
expected ranges.
5. Record and interpret results based on laboratory reference
ranges.
F. Documentation:
1. Log all results and any deviations from the procedure in a
laboratory information management system (LIMS) or paper
logbook.
2. Ensure documentation includes sample IDs, reagent lot
numbers, technician details, and date/time of testing.
3. Review and sign off by a qualified supervisor.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
5. Perform quality control (QC) for each batch of tests, including
positive and negative controls.
6. Ensure QC materials are stored and handled according to
manufacturer specifications.
7. Repeat any runs where controls have failed, and investigate
any errors.
8. SAFETY
9. Use standard precautions when handling all specimens and
reagents.
10. Work within a Class II biosafety cabinet when handling plasma
and reagents.
11. Dispose of all biohazardous waste according to institutional
policies.

1. REVIEW AND REVISION
This SOP must be reviewed annually by the supervisory team or as
required due to changes in practice, reagents, or equipment. Any
amendments will be documented and communicated to all relevant
personnel.
