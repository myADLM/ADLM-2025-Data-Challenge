SOP: HIV-1 RNA Quantification with Reflex to Genotypic Drug
Resistance to Reverse Transcriptase, Protease, and Integrase
Inhibitors, Plasma
1. Purpose:
To ensure accurate and reliable quantification of HIV-1 RNA levels in
plasma and to reflex any positive results for genotypic drug
resistance testing to reverse transcriptase (RT), protease (PR), and
integrase (IN) inhibitors. This protocol outlines the procedures for the
analytical phase, including the quantification of HIV-1 RNA and
subsequent genotypic testing if applicable.
2. Responsibilities:
The responsibility for performing HIV-1 RNA quantification and reflex
genotypic testing lies with designated molecular laboratory
personnel. They must ensure all steps are conducted according to
this protocol and that results are accurately documented.
3. Specimen:
3.1. Acceptable Specimens:
• Plasma collected in EDTA tubes
• Minimum volume required: 1.0 mL
3.2. Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens not collected in EDTA tubes
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or clotted specimens
• Specimens with insufficient volume
• Specimens received at the laboratory more than 24 hours post-
collection without refrigeration or more than 72 hours post-
collection with refrigeration
4. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies:
• Real-time PCR Instrument
• HIV-1 RNA Extraction Kit
• HIV-1 Quantification Reagents and Calibration Standards
• Genotypic Drug Resistance Testing Kit
• Positive and Negative Control Materials
• Pipettes and filter tips
• Biohazard waste containers
• Appropriate PPE (Personal Protective Equipment)
• Software for data analysis and reporting
5. Procedure:
5.1. HIV-1 RNA Quantification:
5.1.1. Sample Preparation: A. Thaw plasma samples at room
temperature if frozen. B. Vortex samples briefly to ensure
homogeneity. C. Aliquot the required volume of plasma for RNA
extraction according to the manufacturer's instructions for the
extraction kit in use.
5.1.2. RNA Extraction: A. Follow the RNA extraction kit protocol to
isolate HIV-1 RNA from plasma samples. B. Include extraction
positive and negative controls in each batch. C. Elute RNA in the
appropriate volume of elution buffer provided by the extraction kit.
5.1.3. PCR Setup: A. Prepare PCR master mix and reaction mix
based on the HIV-1 quantification kit instructions. B. Pipette the
appropriate volume of extracted RNA into each PCR tube or well. C.
Add quantification standards and controls (negative and positive) to
include in the run.
5.1.4. PCR Amplification and Detection: A. Load the PCR tubes/
wells into the real-time PCR instrument. B. Program the instrument
with the specified thermocycling conditions provided by the RNA
quantification kit. C. Run the amplification and detection program.
5.1.5. Data Analysis and Results Interpretation: A. Analyze the
amplification data using the real-time PCR instrument software. B.
Quantify HIV-1 RNA levels using calibration curves generated with
the standards. C. Review results; ensure they fall within the
acceptable control range. Retest if controls fail.
5.1.6. Reporting Quantification Results: A. Document HIV-1 RNA
levels in the patient’s report. B. Reflex any sample with detectable
HIV-1 RNA (above the quantification limit) for genotypic drug
resistance testing.
5.2. Reflex to Genotypic Drug Resistance Testing:
5.2.1. Sample Preparation: A. Use the remaining RNA extract or
repeat extraction from the residual plasma if necessary.
5.2.2. PCR Amplification: A. Follow the kit-specific protocol for
amplifying regions of the HIV-1 genome associated with drug
resistance (RT, PR, and IN).
5.2.3. Sequencing: A. Utilize the genotypic drug resistance testing
kit for sequencing the amplified regions. B. Prepare sequencing
reactions and perform sequencing according to the kit's protocol. C.
Run the sequencing reactions on a compatible sequencer.
5.2.4. Data Analysis: A. Analyze the sequencing data using the
software provided with the resistance testing kit. B. Identify mutations
associated with drug resistance in RT, PR, and IN sequences.
5.2.5. Reporting Drug Resistance Results: A. Document identified
drug resistance mutations in the patient’s report. B. Interpret and
comment on the clinical significance of the mutations according to
current treatment guidelines.
6. Quality Control:
A. Include positive and negative controls in each batch of HIV-1 RNA
quantification and genotypic testing. B. Verify that controls meet the
specified criteria before accepting patient results. C. Perform routine
maintenance and calibration of equipment as per manufacturer
recommendations.
7. Safety Considerations:
A. Follow standard precautions and wear appropriate personal
protective equipment (PPE). B. Dispose of biohazard waste
according to laboratory safety protocols.
