HIV-2 DNA/RNA Qualitative Real-Time PCR SOP
1. Purpose
To provide a standardized procedure for the qualitative detection of
HIV-2 DNA/RNA in clinical specimens using Real-Time PCR
technology.
2. Scope
This protocol applies to all laboratory personnel trained and
authorized to perform HIV-2 DNA/RNA qualitative real-time PCR
testing in a CLIA-certified laboratory.
3. Responsibility
Laboratory technologists are responsible for following this SOP to
ensure accurate results. The supervisor is responsible for reviewing
and validating results, monitoring quality control, and addressing any
issues that arise during the testing process.
4. Specimen Requirements
Acceptable Specimens:
• Whole blood collected in EDTA tubes.
• Plasma or serum collected in appropriate tubes (e.g., plasma
separator tubes).
• Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) collected in sterile containers.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens that are hemolyzed, clotted, or not collected in the
specified tubes.
• Specimens received without proper labeling (e.g., missing patient
identification, collection date, and time).
• Specimens that are not properly stored or transported according
to the guidelines.
5. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies
• Real-Time PCR instrument (e.g., ABI 7500 Fast, Bio-Rad CFX96)
• HIV-2 DNA/RNA extraction kit
• HIV-2 Real-Time PCR master mix
• PCR grade water
• Sterile, nuclease-free tubes and pipette tips
• Positive control (HIV-2 DNA/RNA)
• Negative control (PCR grade water)
• Calibrated micropipettes and centrifuges
6. Procedure
Specimen Preparation:
1. For Whole Blood, Plasma, and Serum:
◦ Centrifuge blood specimens at 1500-2000 x g for 10-15
minutes to separate plasma or serum.
◦ Transfer the plasma or serum into sterile, nuclease-free
tubes.
2. For CSF:
◦ Use CSF as it is or centrifuge if particulate matter is present.
Extraction of DNA/RNA:
1. Use the HIV-2 DNA/RNA extraction kit according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Ensure all steps are performed in a clean area to prevent
contamination.
3. Elute the extracted DNA/RNA into a sterile, nuclease-free tube.
Store at -20°C if not proceeding immediately to PCR.
Real-Time PCR Setup:
1. Preparation of Master Mix:
◦ Thaw all reagents on ice and mix thoroughly by pipetting.
◦ Prepare the PCR master mix according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Include necessary controls (positive and negative).
2. Plate Setup:
◦ In a 96-well plate, aliquot 20 µL of master mix into each
designated well.
◦ Add 5 µL of extracted DNA/RNA from each specimen to the
corresponding well.
◦ Add 5 µL of positive control to one well and 5 µL negative
control (PCR grade water) to another.
3. PCR Run:
◦ Seal the plate with an appropriate cover and centrifuge
briefly to ensure contents are at the bottom of the wells.
◦ Place the plate into the Real-Time PCR instrument.
◦ Set up the PCR run with the appropriate cycling parameters:
initial activation at 95°C for 2 minutes, followed by 45 cycles
of denaturation at 95°C for 15 seconds and annealing/
extension at 60°C for 1 minute.
Data Analysis:
1. Upon completion, review the amplification curves and confirm
the cycle threshold (Ct) values.
2. Compare the Ct values of the specimens to those of the
positive and negative controls:
◦ Positive Result: Specimen shows amplification with Ct
value within the positive control range.
◦ Negative Result: Specimen does not show amplification,
similar to the negative control.
◦ Invalid Result: If the positive control fails to amplify or the
negative control shows amplification, repeat the run.
Quality Control:
1. Run internal controls with each batch of specimens.
2. Document all details, including lot numbers of reagents, control
results, and specimen IDs, in the PCR log.
Reporting Results:
1. Review and verify results according to the procedure.
2. Enter results into the laboratory information system (LIS) and
ensure proper documentation.
3. Report critical results to the requesting clinician promptly,
following the standard notification procedures.
