STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP) Title: HIV Antigen
and Antibody Prenatal Routine Screen, Plasma
1. PURPOSE: This procedure outlines the steps for the analysis of
HIV antigen and antibody in prenatal routine screening using
plasma samples. The objective is to ensure consistent, reliable,
and accurate detection, meeting regulatory and quality control
requirements.
2. SCOPE: This protocol applies to all laboratory personnel
involved in the analytical phase of HIV antigen and antibody
testing for prenatal screening. It is relevant to plasma samples
that have already been collected, received, and accessioned
into the laboratory information system.
3. RESPONSIBILITY: It is the responsibility of designated
laboratory personnel to perform the procedure as outlined and
document all relevant data accurately. Any deviations or
anomalies must be reported to the supervisor promptly.
4. SPECIMEN:
◦ Preferred/acceptable:
▪ Plasma collected in EDTA or lithium heparin tubes.
▪ Specimens should be separated from cells and tested as
soon as possible. If testing is delayed, plasma should be
stored at 2-8°C for up to 72 hours. For longer storage,
freeze at -20°C or lower.
◦ Unacceptable:
▪ Hemolyzed, icteric, or lipemic specimens.
▪ Specimens stored at room temperature for more than 24
hours.
▪ Specimens with a time-lapse of more than 72 hours
between collection and testing without proper storage.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES:
◦ HIV 1/2 antigen and antibody combo assay kit approved by
the regulatory standards.
◦ Calibrators and controls specific to the assay kit.
◦ Microplate reader or compatible automated immunoassay
analyzer.
◦ Pipettes and tips (calibrated and cleaned).
◦ Laboratory timer.
◦ Personal protective equipment (PPE).
◦ Appropriate waste containers.
6. PROCEDURE: a. Initial Setup:
◦ Wear appropriate PPE (gloves, lab coat, goggles).
◦ Ensure that all equipment, reagents, and supplies are
available and within their expiry date.
◦ Calibrate the microplate reader/analyzer as per the
manufacturer’s instructions.
b. Reagent Preparation:
◦ Prepare the reagents, calibrators, and controls as per the
manufacturer’s instructions located in the package insert.
◦ Allow all reagents to reach room temperature (if required)
before use, avoiding prolonged exposure to room
temperature.
c. Sample Preparation:
◦ Centrifuge the plasma samples at 1500-2000 x g for 10-15
minutes to remove any particulates.
◦ Carefully transfer the supernatant plasma to a clean, labeled
tube, avoiding the cellular layer.
d. Assay Procedure:
◦ Follow the specific assay steps as indicated in the package
insert for the antigen and antibody combo assay:
1. Add calibrators, controls, and test plasma samples to
the designated wells of the microplate.
2. Pipette the conjugate reagent into each well and mix
gently.
3. Incubate the plate for the specified time at room
temperature or as directed.
4. Wash the wells thoroughly using the provided wash
buffer, ensuring to follow the specified number of wash
cycles.
5. Add the substrate solution to each well and incubate
as directed.
6. Stop the reaction by adding the stop solution at the
designated time.
7. Read the absorbance values using the microplate
reader at the specified wavelength.
e. Quality Control:
◦ Run quality control materials (positive and negative controls)
with each batch of testing.
◦ Evaluate the control results to ensure they are within the
acceptable range before validating the patient results.
◦ Document all control results in the Quality Control Log.
7. CALCULATION OF RESULTS:
◦ The microplate reader or analyzer software will provide the
results of the testing.
◦ Interpret the results according to the cut-off values and
criteria specified in the package insert.
◦ Positive, negative, and indeterminate results should be
reported as outlined in the site-specific reporting guidelines.
8. REPORTING RESULTS:
◦ Review and verify all results for accuracy.
◦ Enter patient results into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
◦ Ensure that critical or reactive results are communicated
promptly to the appropriate healthcare provider following
site-specific guidelines.
9. REFERENCE INTERVALS:
◦ Positive: Reactive for either HIV-1 p24 antigen or HIV-1/2
antibodies or both.
◦ Negative: Non-reactive for both HIV-1 p24 antigen and
HIV-1/2 antibodies.
◦ Indeterminate: Results that do not clearly fall into the
positive or negative categories; further testing may be
required.
10. TROUBLESHOOTING:
• If quality control results fall outside the acceptable range, repeat
the assay.
• Investigate potential reasons for failure, such as reagent expiry,
equipment malfunction, or procedural errors.
• Contact the supervisor for further instructions if troubleshooting
does not resolve the issue.
1. REFERENCES:
• Manufacturer’s package insert for the specific HIV antigen and
antibody combo assay kit.
• Laboratory quality control guidelines as per CLIA and regulatory
standards.
• LIS reporting protocols.
1. DOCUMENTATION:
• Record all assay details including dates, times, lot numbers, and
personnel performing the test in the laboratory logbook.
• Maintain all results and quality control data for the required length
of time as specified by regulatory standards and laboratory
policies.
This SOP is effective as of [Effective Date] and will be reviewed
annually or as required by changes in laboratory practices or
regulatory requirements.
