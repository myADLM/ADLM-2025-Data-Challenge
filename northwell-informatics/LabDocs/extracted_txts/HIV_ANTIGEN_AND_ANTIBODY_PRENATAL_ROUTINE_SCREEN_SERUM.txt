Protocol for HIV Antigen and Antibody Prenatal Routine Screen,
Serum: Analytical Phase
1. Purpose
The purpose of this protocol is to outline the procedural steps and
quality control measures for the analytical phase of generating results
for the HIV Antigen and Antibody Prenatal Routine Screen, Serum
test. This assay is used to detect and differentiate HIV-1, HIV-2, and
HIV-1 p24 antigen in human serum specimens as part of routine
prenatal screening.
2. Scope
This protocol applies to all laboratory personnel who are responsible
for performing the HIV Antigen and Antibody Prenatal Routine
Screen, Serum test in the clinical laboratory.
3. Responsibilities
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing the
test, documenting the results, and ensuring quality control
procedures are followed. Laboratory supervisors are responsible for
overseeing the process, addressing any troubleshooting, and
ensuring all personnel are trained and competent in the procedure.
4. Procedure
4.1. Reagents and Supplies
• HIV-1/2 Antigen and Antibody Testing Kit (manufacturer-specific)
• Quality control material (positive and negative controls)
• Calibrators (if required by kit)
• Serum specimens
• Micropipettes and tips
• Incubator
• Plate washer (if using ELISA-based kits)
• Plate reader (if using ELISA-based kits)
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
4.2. Equipment Preparation and Maintenance
• Ensure all equipment (incubator, plate washer, plate reader) is in
good working condition and calibrated according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
• Document maintenance and calibration activities in the relevant
logs.
4.3. Test Procedure
1. Specimen Handling and Preparation
◦ Ensure that serum specimens have been received,
accessioned, and appropriately stored (refrigerated at
2-8°C).
◦ Allow serum specimens to reach room temperature before
analysis.
◦ Mix serum specimens gently by inversion to ensure
homogeneity.
2. Reagent Preparation
◦ Prepare reagents according to the manufacturer's
instructions in the HIV-1/2 Antigen and Antibody Testing Kit
package insert.
◦ Reconstitute controls and calibrators (if required) following
the manufacturer's guidelines.
3. Assay Setup
◦ Arrange the necessary number of microwell strips (or
equivalent, depending on testing platform) in the plate
holder.
◦ Label the wells accordingly for controls, calibrators, and
patient specimens.
◦ Add the appropriate volume of controls, calibrators, and
patient serum to designated wells using micropipettes with
filtered tips to avoid cross-contamination.
◦ Add reagents (e.g., conjugate, substrate) to the wells as
specified in the kit instructions.
4. Incubation
◦ Incubate the plate at the specified temperature (e.g., 37°C)
for the time indicated in the kit protocol.
◦ Follow the incubation steps carefully, including any required
washes between steps using a plate washer (if applicable).
5. Reading the Results
◦ After the final incubation and wash steps, add the stopping
solution to each well (if required) to halt the enzymatic
reaction.
◦ Read the absorbance (or fluorescence, chemiluminescence)
values using the plate reader at the specified wavelength.
6. Result Interpretation
◦ Interpret the results based on the manufacturer's provided
cut-off values and guidelines.
◦ Ensure proper differentiation of HIV-1, HIV-2, and HIV-1 p24
antigen as applicable.
◦ Record the values and interpretations in the laboratory
information system (LIS).
5. Quality Control Procedures
• Run at least one positive control, one negative control, and one
calibrator (if required) with each batch of assays.
• Accept the run only if the controls meet the criteria specified by
the manufacturer.
• Document all control results in the Quality Control Log.
• Evaluate any deviations and take corrective actions as necessary,
documenting all steps taken.
6. Reporting Results
• Verify the results by reviewing the controls and patient data.
• Enter and verify results in the laboratory information system (LIS).
• Follow up any critical or inconclusive results according to
laboratory policy, which may include repeat testing or additional
confirmatory assays.
• Ensure timely reporting of results to the clinician, particularly for
prenatal cases.
7. Method Limitations
Refer to the HIV-1/2 Antigen and Antibody Testing Kit package insert
for specific limitations related to the assay.
8. Documentation and Records
• Maintain all records of equipment maintenance, calibration,
reagent preparation, control runs, and patient results.
• Ensure proper documentation for any troubleshooting and
corrective actions taken.
9. References
• Manufacturer’s instructions and package insert for the HIV-1/2
Antigen and Antibody Testing Kit
• Laboratory Quality Control Guidelines
• CLIA Regulations and Guidelines
10. Revision History
• Document any revisions with date, author, and summary of
changes.
By adhering to this protocol, laboratory personnel can ensure
accurate and reliable results for the HIV Antigen and Antibody
Prenatal Routine Screen, Serum test, contributing to the effective
management of prenatal care.
