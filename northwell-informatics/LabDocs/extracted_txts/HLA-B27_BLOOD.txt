Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for HLA-B27 Blood Testing
1. PURPOSE
To provide a systematic and standardized method for the detection
and reporting of HLA-B27 in blood samples using flow cytometry.
This protocol ensures consistent and accurate analytical
measurements to aid in the diagnosis of diseases such as ankylosing
spondylitis and other autoimmune disorders.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
This procedure must be followed by all qualified laboratory personnel
trained in the operation of flow cytometry for HLA-B27 testing.
1. DEFINITIONS
HLA-B27: Human Leukocyte Antigen B27, an antigen that is
genetically inherited and associated with autoimmune disorders,
particularly ankylosing spondylitis.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen Type: Whole blood Preferred Collection Container: EDTA
(lavender top) tube Volume Required: Minimum of 5 mL of whole
blood Stability: - Room Temperature: 24 hours - Refrigerated (2-8°C):
72 hours - Do not freeze
1. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• HLA-B27 monoclonal antibody reagent (FITC-conjugated)
• Flow cytometry sheath fluid
• Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)
• Hemolysis reagent (if required)
• Flow cytometer calibration beads
• 12 x 75 mm polypropylene test tubes
• Vortex mixer
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
1. EQUIPMENT
• Flow cytometer with appropriate software (e.g., BD FACSDiva,
CellQuest)
• Centrifuge
• Vortex mixer
1. PROCEDURE
A) Sample Preparation:
1. Label the required number of test tubes with patient identifiers.
2. Add 100 µL of well-mixed whole blood to each labeled test tube.
3. Add 10 µL of HLA-B27 FITC-conjugated monoclonal antibody
reagent to each tube.
4. Vortex gently to mix and incubate the tubes at room
temperature for 15 minutes in the dark.
5. After incubation, add 2 mL of lysing reagent to each tube.
Vortex gently.
6. Incubate for an additional 10 minutes at room temperature in
the dark.
7. Centrifuge the tubes at 300 x g for 5 minutes.
8. Carefully aspirate the supernatant without disturbing the cell
pellet.
9. Resuspend the cell pellet in 2 mL PBS. Vortex gently to mix.
10. Repeat the wash step (steps 7 - 9) two more times.
B) Flow Cytometry Analysis:
1. Prepare the flow cytometer according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
2. Perform instrument calibration using flow cytometry calibration
beads.
3. Set up acquisition parameters:
◦ Forward Scatter (FSC)
◦ Side Scatter (SSC)
◦ Fluorescence channel for FITC
4. Analyze the prepared samples on the flow cytometer.
5. Acquire at least 10,000 events per sample to ensure an
adequate cell count.
6. Gate on lymphocytes using FSC and SSC parameters.
7. Analyze the gated lymphocytes for FITC positivity.
8. Record and save the data for each sample.
9. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run quality control samples (positive and negative controls) with
each batch of patient samples.
• Perform data validation checks to ensure accuracy and
reproducibility of results.
• Document any deviations from standard procedures and
corrective actions taken.
• Review daily QC records to identify trends or shifts in control
values.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Compare the percentage of HLA-B27 positive cells to the
laboratory's established reference range.
• Report results as either "HLA-B27 Detected" or "HLA-B27 Not
Detected".
• Report critical values immediately to the requesting physician or
healthcare provider.
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS) and
verify accuracy before releasing the final report.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Reference intervals may vary based on the population and methods
used in the laboratory. Follow manufacturer guidelines and validate
against internal patient data.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• False positives/negatives may occur due to technical errors,
sample integrity issues, or the presence of interfering substances.
• Follow all instructions and precautions included in reagent and
instrument manuals to minimize errors.
• Results should be interpreted in the context of clinical findings
and other laboratory tests.
