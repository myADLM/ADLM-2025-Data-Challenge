Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): HLA-B*57:01 Genotype
Testing for Pharmacogenomics
1. Purpose
The purpose of this procedure is to establish the standardized
process for the detection and documentation of the HLA-B*57:01
genotype in patient samples. This testing is crucial for the
identification of individuals who may be at risk of adverse reactions to
specific pharmacological treatments, particularly abacavir.
2. Scope
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel responsible for
performing HLA-B*57:01 genotype testing using PCR-based
methodologies and includes steps from receipt of extracted genomic
DNA to the generation and reporting of results.
3. Responsibilities
• Laboratory Technologists: Responsible for performing HLA-
B*57:01 genotype testing as per this SOP and ensuring quality
control measures are maintained.
• Supervisors: Oversee the testing process, review and verify
results, and ensure that all procedures comply with regulatory
standards.
• Data Entry Personnel: Ensure accurate entry of results into the
Laboratory Information System (LIS).
4. Definitions
• HLA-B*57:01: A specific allele of the human leukocyte antigen B
(HLA-B) gene that is involved in immune responses.
• PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction): A molecular technique used
to amplify and detect specific DNA sequences.
5. Specimen Requirements
• Type: Collected and extracted genomic DNA from a patient’s
peripheral blood.
• Volume: Minimum of 50 µL of DNA with a concentration of at least
20 ng/µL.
• Storage: Store isolated DNA at -20°C until ready for use.
6. Reagents and Materials
• PCR master mix
• HLA-B*57:01 specific primers and probes
• Nuclease-free water
• Positive and negative control DNA
• PCR tubes/plates
• Thermal cycler
• Laboratory consumables (pipettes, gloves, etc.)
7. Equipment
• Thermal Cycler
• Gel Electrophoresis System (if required for confirmation)
• Real-time PCR System (if using real-time PCR)
• Laboratory Information System (LIS)
8. Procedure
A. Pre-PCR Setup
1. Preparation of Master Mix:
◦ Thaw all reagents on ice.
◦ Prepare the PCR master mix on ice according to the
manufacturer’s instructions, including primers, probes, and
polymerase.
◦ Ensure final mixture contains appropriate concentrations as
specified.
2. Template DNA Addition:
◦ Aliquot the master mix into PCR tubes or plate wells.
◦ Add the required volume of DNA sample to each PCR
reaction well/tube.
◦ Include at least one positive control, one negative control,
and a blank for each run.
B. PCR Amplification:
• Briefly centrifuge the PCR plate/tubes to mix contents and remove
air bubbles.
• Place the PCR plate/tubes in the thermal cycler.
• Run the PCR program as follows: i. Initial denaturation: 95°C for 3
minutes ii. Denaturation: 95°C for 15 seconds iii. Annealing/
Extension: 60°C for 1 minute (Repeat steps ii – iii for 40 cycles) iv.
Final extension: 60°C for 5 minutes
• Adjust parameters as needed based on specific kit or assay
requirements.
C. Post-PCR Analysis:
• Following PCR, proceed with detection based on the methodology
used:
◦ Real-time PCR: Analyze fluorescence data for genotyping.
◦ End-point PCR with Gel Electrophoresis: Perform
electrophoresis to visualize amplified products.
• Interpret results by comparing with controls:
◦ Positive control must show the correct amplification.
◦ Negative control should have no detectable amplification.
9. Quality Control
• Run a known positive and negative control with every batch of
tests to ensure reagent integrity and PCR reaction efficiency.
• Perform and document routine maintenance of equipment as
specified by manufacturer guidelines.
• Ensure periodic review of control performance to identify any
trends or issues.
10. Reporting Results
• Analyze and interpret the HLA-B*57:01 genotype data.
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Verify results with a supervisor before final approval.
• Ensure that results are communicated to the relevant healthcare
provider securely and accurately, following site-specific reporting
guidelines.
11. Reference Intervals
• HLA-B*57:01 Positive: Indicates presence of the allele, higher
risk for adverse drug reaction (e.g., abacavir hypersensitivity).
• HLA-B*57:01 Negative: Indicates absence of the allele, lower
risk for adverse reaction related to HLA-B*57:01.
12. Method Limitations
• Ensure high-fidelity DNA extraction to avoid false results.
• Inhibitors in the sample may affect PCR efficiency; use
appropriate internal controls to identify such issues.
13. Documentation and References
• Maintain records of all procedures, controls, and results as
required by regulatory standards.
• Use manufacturer’s guidelines and package inserts for detailed
assay information.
• Refer to latest scientific literature for updates on
pharmacogenomic implications of HLA-B*57:01.
By following this SOP, adherence to consistent and reliable HLA-
B*57:01 genotyping will be maintained, ensuring accurate and useful
pharmacogenomic data for patient care.
