Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): HLA-B*5801
Genotype for Allopurinol Hypersensitivity Testing
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to describe the analytical phase
procedures for detecting HLA-B*5801 genotype associated with
allopurinol hypersensitivity. This protocol ensures accurate,
consistent, and timely generation of results.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to laboratory personnel trained in molecular
genetics techniques and using the laboratory’s designated platforms
for HLA genotyping. This procedure should be executed in
compliance with CLIA regulations.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the laboratory technologists to follow this
SOP and ensure accurate results. Laboratory supervisors must
review and validate the results before they are released.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Whole blood collected in EDTA tubes.
• Specimen Stability: Store at 2-8°C until DNA extraction. Extracted
DNA should be stored at -20°C.
• Unacceptable Specimens: Hemolyzed, clotted, or mislabeled
specimens.
5. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Equipment:
◦ Thermal cycler
◦ Real-time PCR instrument with appropriate software
◦ Microcentrifuge
◦ Vortex mixer
◦ Pipettes and sterile pipette tips
• Reagents:
◦ DNA extraction kit
◦ HLA-B*5801 genotyping kit (includes primers and probes)
◦ PCR master mix
◦ Nuclease-free water
◦ Positive and negative control DNA samples
6. PROCEDURE
6.1. DNA Extraction
1. Preparation: Thaw the whole blood specimen at room
temperature if stored at 2-8°C. Gently mix by inverting several
times.
2. Extraction: Extract genomic DNA using the designated
extraction kit following the manufacturer’s instructions.
3. Quantification: Measure DNA concentration and purity using a
spectrophotometer or equivalent.
6.2. PCR Setup
1. Preparation:
◦ Clean the work area with 70% ethanol to prevent
contamination.
◦ Wear appropriate PPE (lab coat, gloves).
2. Master Mix Preparation: In a PCR clean area, prepare the
master mix according to the genotyping kit instructions. Include
controls in every run to ensure assay validity.
3. Sample Loading: Aliquot the master mix into PCR tubes or
plates. Add DNA samples, positive control, and negative
control.
4. PCR Protocol:
◦ Place the tubes or plates in the thermal cycler.
◦ Use the cycling conditions specified in the genotyping kit.
6.3. Real-Time PCR
1. Instrument Setup: Set up the real-time PCR instrument
following the manufacturer's guidelines.
2. Data Acquisition: Run the real-time PCR program. The
instrument will automatically record and analyze the
fluorescence data.
6.4. Data Analysis
1. Software Analysis: Use the designated software to interpret
the results. The presence or absence of HLA-B*5801 specific
amplification will determine the genotype.
2. Validation: Verify that the positive and negative controls have
produced expected results. If not, the run must be considered
invalid, and the analysis should be repeated.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include both positive and negative controls in each run to ensure
assay performance.
• Participate in external proficiency testing programs as available.
• Review control results regularly to detect any drift in performance.
• Perform regular maintenance and calibration of the thermal cycler
and real-time PCR instrument.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Interpret the results based on the software analysis.
• Document the results in the laboratory information system (LIS).
• Positive results are indicative of the presence of the HLA-B*5801
allele, while negative results indicate its absence.
• Results should be reviewed and validated by a supervisor before
release.
9. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Positive: HLA-B*5801 allele detected.
• Negative: HLA-B*5801 allele not detected.
10. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Inadequate specimen quality can lead to false positives or
negatives.
• Follow the manufacturer's instructions and quality control
guidelines strictly to avoid technical errors.
11. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's instructions for the HLA-B*5801 genotyping kit.
• Relevant clinical and laboratory standards documentation.
This SOP should be reviewed and updated regularly to adapt to new
guidelines and technological advancements. All personnel must be
trained and demonstrate competency on this procedure.
