HLA-A HIGH RESOLUTION RESULTS GENERATION PROTOCOL
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is to
outline the steps and procedures for generating high resolution HLA-
A typing results to ensure consistency, accuracy, and reliability.
Responsibility:
• The responsibility for generating and reviewing high-resolution
HLA-A results lies with trained laboratory personnel.
• It is the responsibility of all staff to identify any deficiencies or
discrepancies in the results and bring them to the attention of a
supervisor.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen:
• Preferred: Freshly collected whole blood or buccal swab stored at
room temperature.
• Acceptable: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) stored
in appropriate freezing conditions.
• Unacceptable: Specimens which are clotted, hemolyzed, or
collected in inappropriate anticoagulants or containers.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• PCR machine
• High-resolution HLA typing kits (specific to the manufacturer)
• DNA extraction kit
• Gel electrophoresis equipment
• Sequencing reagents and supplies
• Laboratory consumables (e.g., tubes, pipette tips, gloves)
• Laboratory Information System (LIS) for result tracking and
reporting
1. PROCEDURE
A) DNA Extraction:
1. Follow the DNA extraction protocol as indicated by the
manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Quantify and assess the purity of extracted DNA using
spectrophotometry or fluorometry.
B) PCR Amplification:
1. Prepare the PCR mixture using high-resolution HLA-A specific
primers and master mix.
2. Add the appropriate volume of extracted DNA to each PCR
tube or well.
3. Set up the PCR machine according to the manufacturer’s
guidelines to amplify HLA-A loci.
4. Confirm successful PCR amplification by running a sample of
the PCR products on agarose gel electrophoresis.
C) Sequencing:
1. Purify PCR products as per the sequencing reagent kit
instructions.
2. Set up the sequencing reaction using high-resolution HLA-A
sequencing primers.
3. Cycle sequence the purified PCR product using a sequencing
machine following the manufacturer’s protocol.
D) Data Analysis:
1. Transfer sequencing raw data to dedicated software for
sequence analysis.
2. Align sequences and compare against HLA-A reference
sequences.
3. Identify HLA-A alleles using specialized HLA genotyping
software.
E) Result Verification:
1. Review the generated HLA-A allele results.
2. Verify results by comparing with known HLA-A allele databases.
3. Cross-check results with quality control measures to ensure
accuracy.
F) Results Reporting:
1. Enter the verified HLA-A high-resolution typing results into the
Laboratory Information System (LIS).
2. Ensure all results are properly documented including patient
information, specimen details, and test results.
3. Notify the responsible medical personnel and provide access to
the results within the LIS.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
• Use positive and negative controls for each batch of PCR and
sequencing reactions.
• Regularly validate instruments and reagents used in HLA-A
typing.
• Maintain detailed records of all controls and validation checks.
• Perform proficiency testing periodically to ensure testing accuracy
and reliability.
