Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for HLA-B27 Antigen
Typing, Blood
1. PURPOSE
This SOP describes the methodology for human leukocyte antigen-
B27 (HLA-B27) antigen typing from whole blood to ensure accurate
and reliable results. HLA-B27 typing is utilized primarily in diagnosing
and managing autoimmune disorders, particularly ankylosing
spondylitis.
Responsibility:
Laboratory personnel trained in HLA typing are responsible for
performing, documenting and validating this procedure. It is the
responsibility of the supervisor to ensure compliance with this
procedure and troubleshoot any issues.
2. DEFINITION
HLA-B27 is a specific protein located on the surface of white blood
cells and is linked with autoimmune diseases. Phenotyping of HLA-
B27 in blood is done using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) followed
by sequence-specific oligonucleotide (SSO) probing or flow
cytometry.
3. PROCEDURE
Specimens:
Preferred: 5-10 mL of peripheral blood in EDTA (lavender top) or ACD (yellow top) tube.
Unacceptable: Clotted blood, hemolyzed specimens, specimens not received at appropriate temperature, improperly labeled specimens.
Equipment and Reagents:
- PCR Thermocycler
- Sequence-Specific Oligonucleotide (SSO) Probe Kit or HLA-B27 Typing Kit
- Flow Cytometry Equipment (if applicable)
- DNA Extraction Kits
- EDTA or ACD blood collection tubes
- Micropipettes and Tips
- Nuclease-free Water
- Agarose Gel Electrophoresis Setup (for PCR based methods)
- Control Samples (HLA-B27 positive and negative)
- Ethidium Bromide or GelRed (for agarose gel staining, if using PCR method)
Bandages and PPE:
- Gloves, Lab coat, and other PPE required
Procedure:
DNA Extraction:
1. Perform DNA extraction using the preferred DNA extraction kit
as per manufacturer’s protocol.
2. Quantify and assess DNA quality using spectrophotometry or
equivalent.
PCR Amplification (if using PCR-based method):
1. Prepare the PCR Master Mix including:
◦ DNA extract (template)
◦ PCR buffer
◦ dNTPs
◦ Primers specific for HLA-B27
◦ DNA polymerase
◦ Nuclease-free water
2. Pipette master mix into PCR tubes/plate.
3. Run PCR program as per protocol.
Post-PCR Processing:
1. If SSO Probing:
◦ Transfer PCR product to hybridization buffer.
◦ Allow hybridization with SSO probes specific to HLA-B27.
◦ Wash and detect bound probes using a colorimetric enzyme
substrate or fluorescence.
2. If Agarose Gel Electrophoresis:
◦ Prepare and load samples with DNA ladder on agarose gel.
◦ Run electrophoresis to separate amplicons.
◦ Stain gel and visualize bands under UV light.
Flow Cytometry Method (if applicable):
1. Incubate blood sample with fluorochrome-conjugated anti-HLA-
B27 antibodies.
2. Lyse red blood cells using lysing solution.
3. Wash cells and prepare for flow cytometry analysis.
4. Analyze stained cells with flow cytometry for HLA-B27
expression.
Quality Control:
• Always include positive (HLA-B27 positive) and negative (HLA-
B27 negative) controls in each run.
• Compare patient samples with control to ensure validity.
• Document control results and troubleshoot if controls are out of
range.
Reporting Results:
1. Document findings in a standardized form.
2. Report qualitative presence or absence of the HLA-B27
antigen.
3. Validate and verify results before final reporting.
Reference Intervals:
• HLA-B27 Positive
• HLA-B27 Negative
Method Limitations:
• Extraction and amplification of high-quality DNA are crucial for
accurate PCR-based results.
• Interpretation of flow cytometry can be affected by non-specific
binding.
• Possibility of cross-contamination due to pre-amplification and
post-amplification workflows.

probes, and flow cytometry reagents.

disorders.

• MSDS for all reagents and dyes.
Review and Approval: This SOP is reviewed annually or upon
significant procedural changes and approved by the Laboratory
Supervisor and Medical Director.
