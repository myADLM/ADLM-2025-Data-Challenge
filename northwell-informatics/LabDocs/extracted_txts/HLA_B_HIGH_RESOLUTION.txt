HLA B High Resolution Genotyping Standard Operating
Procedure (SOP)
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for performing high resolution typing of HLA
B alleles within the laboratory, ensuring accuracy, reliability, and
reproducibility of results.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel trained to perform HLA B
high resolution genotyping using the designated platform and
methods detailed herein.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing
the procedures outlined in this SOP.
• Laboratory supervisors are responsible for ensuring compliance
with this SOP, providing necessary training and resources, and
addressing any issues that arise during testing.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Peripheral blood, buccal swabs, or other
validated source of genomic DNA.
• Preferred Volume: 3-5 mL peripheral blood collected in an EDTA
tube or equivalent.
• DNA Concentration: 20-100 ng/μL
• DNA Quality: A260/A280 ratio between 1.8 and 2.0 for DNA purity
Acceptable Storage Conditions:
• Blood/Whole specimen: Stored at 2-8°C, stable for up to 7 days.
• Isolated DNA: Stored at -20°C for long-term stability.
5. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Thermal Cycler
• Gel Electrophoresis Equipment
• DNA Extraction Kit
• PCR Master Mix and Primers specific for HLA B alleles
• High Resolution Melt Analysis (HRM) or Sequencing Platform
• Pipettes and Tips
• Microcentrifuge Tubes
• Nuclease-Free Water
• Positive and Negative Control Samples
6. PROCEDURE
A. DNA Extraction
1. Using the validated DNA extraction kit, extract genomic DNA
from the received specimens following the manufacturer’s
instructions.
2. Measure DNA concentration and purity using a
spectrophotometer. Record the values.
3. Adjust the DNA concentration to 50 ng/μL using nuclease-free
water if necessary.
B. Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) Amplification
1. Prepare the PCR Master Mix according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
2. Add the appropriate volume of DNA template to each PCR
reaction tube.
3. Load the PCR tubes into the thermal cycler and run the PCR
program specific for HLA B high resolution typing.
◦ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 5 minutes
◦ 35 cycles of:
▪ Denaturation: 95°C for 30 seconds
▪ Annealing: 60°C for 30 seconds
▪ Extension: 72°C for 45 seconds
◦ Final extension: 72°C for 5 minutes
◦ Hold: 4°C
C. Post-PCR Analysis
1. Verify PCR amplification success by running an aliquot of the
PCR product on an agarose gel.
2. If bands of the expected size are present, proceed with High
Resolution Melt (HRM) analysis or sequencing for HLA B
alleles:
HRM Analysis:
◦ Prepare HRM reagents and dyes as per manufacturer’s
instructions.
◦ Perform HRM analysis using the designated thermal cycler.
◦ Analyze HRM profiles using the software provided,
comparing sample curves to control curves.
Sequencing:
◦ Purify PCR products using a spin column purification kit.
◦ Prepare sequencing reactions using the purified PCR
product.
◦ Load prepared sequencing reactions onto the sequencing
instrument and run the sequencing protocol.
◦ Analyze sequencing data using specialized HLA software to
determine alleles.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Include both positive control (known HLA B alleles) and
negative control (no template) in each run to ensure the
accuracy and specificity of the PCR amplification and post-PCR
analysis.
2. Regularly calibrate and maintain equipment according to the
manufacturer’s guidelines and document all maintenance
activities.
3. Perform bi-annual proficiency testing with external quality
assessment (EQA) programs to ensure the lab’s performance
meets national and international standards.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Review sequence data or HRM profiles to assign HLA B alleles.
2. Ensure double-checking of results by another qualified
technologist or supervisor.
3. Document the results in the Laboratory Information System
(LIS) and generate a report.
4. Report any discrepancies to a supervisor immediately and
resolve them before result release.
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Ensure proper specimen collection and handling to avoid DNA
degradation.
• Cross-contamination during PCR setup must be avoided by using
proper aseptic techniques.
• Interpretation of results must consider all control outcomes and
potential PCR inhibitors in the sample.
