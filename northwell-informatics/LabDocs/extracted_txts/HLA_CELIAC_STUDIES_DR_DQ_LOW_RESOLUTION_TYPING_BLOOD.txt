Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for HLA: CELIAC STUDIES
(DR/DQ LOW RESOLUTION TYPING), BLOOD
1. PURPOSE To provide accurate and reliable HLA DR/DQ low
resolution typing for the molecular diagnosis of celiac disease in
blood samples, following standard laboratory procedures and
quality control measures.
2. SCOPE This SOP applies to the analytical phase of HLA DR/
DQ low resolution typing for celiac disease studies in a CLIA-
certified laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITIES
◦ Trained laboratory personnel are responsible for performing
the HLA DR/DQ typing according to this SOP and
documenting all steps and observations.
◦ Supervisors are responsible for ensuring the adherence to
this protocol and addressing any issues that arise during
testing.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
◦ Sample Type: Peripheral blood
◦ Preferred Container: EDTA tube (lavender top)
◦ Volume: Minimum 3 mL of whole blood
◦ Storage and Stability: Samples should be processed within
24 hours of collection. If there is a delay, store the sample at
2-8°C for up to 72 hours. Do not freeze the whole blood
sample.
5. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
◦ PCR Thermocycler
◦ DNA Extraction Kits (e.g., QIAamp DNA Mini Kit)
◦ PCR Master Mix (e.g., AmpliTaq Gold DNA Polymerase)
◦ Agarose Gel Electrophoresis System
◦ DNA Ladder
◦ Ethidium Bromide or SYBR Safe DNA Gel Stain
◦ HLA-DR and HLA-DQ specific primers/probes
◦ Positive and Negative Controls
◦ Pipettes and Pipette Tips
◦ Microcentrifuge Tubes
◦ Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
6. PROCEDURE
A. DNA Extraction
1. Perform DNA extraction from the blood sample using a
standardized DNA extraction kit following the manufacturer’s
instructions.
2. Measure the DNA concentration and purity using a NanoDrop
or a similar device.
3. Dilute DNA to a concentration of approximately 20 ng/μL for
PCR amplification.
B. PCR Amplification
1. Prepare the PCR Master Mix as per the kit instructions.
2. Add the appropriate amount of DNA template to the PCR
Master Mix. Use dedicated templates for HLA-DR and HLA-DQ
typing.
3. Include positive and negative controls in the PCR setup.
4. Load the PCR tubes into the thermocycler and run the PCR
program specific for HLA DR/DQ typing.
5. Verify the PCR conditions and cycles as per kit or reagent
instructions.
C. Gel Electrophoresis
1. Prepare a 2% agarose gel with an appropriate DNA stain (e.g.,
ethidium bromide or SYBR Safe).
2. Load the PCR products onto the agarose gel along with a DNA
ladder.
3. Run the gel at 100-120V for 30-40 minutes or until the bands
are well-resolved.
4. Visualize the gel under UV light or a blue light transilluminator.
D. Interpretation
1. Compare the observed bands to the DNA ladder and
appropriate controls.
2. Determine HLA-DR and HLA-DQ types based on the band
patterns and the typing kit interpretation guide.
3. Document the results, including any observations of anomalies
or issues during the process.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Run positive and negative controls with each batch of
samples to ensure the validity of the PCR setup and results.
◦ Use previously typed reference samples periodically to
assess inter-run consistency.
◦ Maintain logs for all controls and ensure deviations are
documented and addressed.
5. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ Record results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
as per laboratory protocol.
◦ Each result must be reviewed and verified by a second
technologist before final verification.
◦ Follow laboratory-specific guidelines for reporting and
releasing results to the requesting physician or facility.
6. TROUBLESHOOTING
◦ If the PCR fails (no amplification in positive control), assess
reagent quality, template DNA quality, and PCR conditions.
◦ Any persistent issues must be reported to a supervisor for
immediate resolution.
