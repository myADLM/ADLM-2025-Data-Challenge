Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for HLA Class II (DRB1,
DRB345, DQA1, DQB1, DPA1, DPB1) Multiple and Single Locus
Typing using DNA-PCR and Next Generation Sequencing (NGS)
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the procedure for HLA Class II typing of blood
specimens using DNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Next
Generation Sequencing (NGS). The goal is to ensure precise, reliable
typing of HLA genes for transplant and other medical purposes.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all blood specimens collected for HLA
Class II typing, specifically covering the loci DRB1, DRB345, DQA1,
DQB1, DPA1, and DPB1. This SOP is intended for use in a CLIA-
certified laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory personnel trained in DNA extraction, PCR, and
NGS procedures are responsible for carrying out this protocol.
Laboratory supervisors are responsible for oversight, verifying
results, and ensuring corrective actions are taken as necessary.
4. DEFINITIONS
• HLA: Human Leukocyte Antigen
• DNA-PCR: DNA Polymerase Chain Reaction
• NGS: Next Generation Sequencing
• DRB1, DRB345, DQA1, DQB1, DPA1, DPB1: Specific HLA Class
II loci
5. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• DNA extraction kit
• PCR thermocycler
• NGS library preparation kit
• Sequencer (e.g., Illumina, Ion Torrent)
• Microcentrifuge
• Pipettes and tips
• Vortex mixer
• Gel electrophoresis apparatus
• Computer with bioinformatics software
6. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen: Whole blood collected in EDTA or ACD tubes
• volume: Minimum of 3 mL
• Stability: Store at 2-8°C for up to 72 hours; for long-term storage,
freeze at -20°C or lower.
7. PROCEDURE
A. DNA Extraction:
1. Using a DNA extraction kit, isolate genomic DNA from blood
samples.
2. Quantify and assess purity of extracted DNA using a
spectrophotometer (e.g., Nanodrop).
3. Aliquot DNA to a concentration of 50 ng/μL.
B. PCR Amplification:
1. Design specific primers targeting the HLA Class II loci (DRB1,
DRB345, DQA1, DQB1, DPA1, DPB1).
2. Set up PCR reactions:
• Template DNA: 50 ng
• Primer mix: 0.5 μM each
• PCR Master Mix: as per manufacturer’s instructions
• Final volume: 50 μL
1. Run the PCR program on a thermocycler:
• Initial denaturation: 95°C for 10 minutes
• 35 cycles of:
◦ Denaturation: 95°C for 30 seconds
◦ Annealing: 55-65°C (optimize for each primer set) for 30
seconds
◦ Extension: 72°C for 1 minute
• Final extension: 72°C for 7 minutes
1. Verify amplification by running an aliquot (5 μL) on a 1.5%
agarose gel.
C. NGS Library Preparation:
1. Purify amplified PCR products using a suitable purification
method (e.g., magnetic beads).
2. Quantify purified PCR products using a fluorometric method
(e.g., Qubit).
3. Prepare NGS libraries using an NGS library preparation kit:
• Fragment DNA if required (e.g., Covaris).
• End-repair, A-tailing, and adapter ligation.
• Purify ligated DNA.
1. Perform library amplification with indexed primers.
2. Purify final libraries and quantify.
D. Sequencing:
1. Load prepared libraries onto the sequencer as per
manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Run the sequencing program ensuring sufficient coverage of
targeted loci.
E. Data Analysis:
1. Transfer sequencing data to a bioinformatics workstation.
2. Analyze data using HLA typing software:
• Align reads to a reference HLA database.
• Assign HLA alleles based on sequence variations.
1. Verify results and interpret findings.
2. Document findings in laboratory information system (LIS).
8. QUALITY CONTROL
Include positive and negative controls in each run to ensure accuracy
and reliability. Analyse controls prior to patient specimens. Repeat
analysis if controls do not perform as expected.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
Review and verify all results. Any discrepancies or unexpected
results should be resolved through repeat testing or additional
analysis. Report results in accordance with laboratory and regulatory
guidelines.
10. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Factors such as DNA quality, PCR specificity, and sequencing depth
can impact results. Carefully validate and troubleshoot each step to
mitigate limitations.
