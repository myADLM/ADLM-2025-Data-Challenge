Standard Operating Procedure: HLA Class II (DR/DQ) Multiple
and Single Locus Typing by DNA-PCR and Sequence-Specific
Oligonucleotide Probes, Blood
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized, accurate, and efficient protocol for the
analysis of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) Class II (DR/DQ) loci
using DNA-PCR and sequence-specific oligonucleotide (SSO)
probes from blood specimens.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to the molecular typing of HLA Class II (DR/
DQ) from whole blood specimens received in the laboratory. The
process includes DNA extraction, PCR amplification, hybridization
with SSO probes, and interpretation of results.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Molecular Technologists: Perform the DNA extraction, PCR,
hybridization, and result interpretation.
• Laboratory Supervisor: Review and validate results and ensure
protocol adherence.
4. DEFINITIONS
HLA Class II (DR/DQ): These loci encode major histocompatibility
complex (MHC) molecules that are critical for immune response
regulation. DNA-PCR: DNA Polymerase Chain Reaction, a method to
amplify DNA. SSO Probes: Sequence-specific oligonucleotide probes
used to detect specific DNA sequences.
5. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Requirements
• Acceptable Specimens:
◦ 3-5 mL of whole blood collected in EDTA (lavender top) tubes.
◦ Blood specimens must be received within 48 hours of
collection and stored at 2-8°C until processing.
• Unacceptable Specimens:
◦ Hemolyzed, clotted, or improperly labeled specimens.
◦ Blood from tubes containing anticoagulants other than EDTA.
B. Reagents and Supplies
• DNA extraction kit (e.g., Qiagen QIAamp Blood Mini Kit)
• PCR reagents and master mix
• Sequence-specific oligonucleotide probes
• Hybridization reagents
• Control DNA samples (positive and negative controls)
• Thermocycler
• Hybridization system (e.g., Luminex platform)
• Microtiter plates, pipettes, and consumables
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
C. DNA Extraction
1. Prepare the Specimens:
◦ Vortex the blood tube to ensure a homogenous sample.
◦ Aliquot 200 µL of whole blood into a labeled microcentrifuge
tube.
2. Follow the DNA Extraction Kit Protocol:
◦ Add the appropriate lysing buffer to the sample and
incubate.
◦ Proceed with DNA purification as per the kit instructions.
◦ Elute DNA in 100 µL of elution buffer and store at 4°C until
PCR setup.
D. PCR Amplification
1. Prepare the PCR Master Mix:
◦ Combine the required volumes of PCR buffer, dNTPs,
MgCl2, primers, Taq polymerase, and molecular-grade
water.
◦ Aliquot 45 µL of the PCR master mix into each labeled PCR
tube or well.
2. Add DNA Template:
◦ Add 5 µL of extracted DNA to each PCR tube or well,
resulting in a total volume of 50 µL.
3. Thermocycler Program:
◦ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 5 minutes
◦ 35 cycles of:
▪ Denaturation: 94°C for 30 seconds
▪ Annealing: 60°C for 45 seconds
▪ Extension: 72°C for 1 minute
◦ Final extension: 72°C for 10 minutes
◦ Hold at 4°C
E. Hybridization with SSO Probes
1. Prepare the Hybridization Master Mix:
◦ Combine hybridization buffer and labeled SSO probes as
per manufacturer instructions.
2. Perform Hybridization:
◦ Denature PCR products at 95°C for 5 minutes.
◦ Cool the samples quickly to room temperature.
◦ Add denatured PCR product to the hybridization mix in a
microtiter plate.
◦ Incubate at the specified temperature (e.g., 55°C) for 30
minutes.
3. Wash and Detect:
◦ Wash the hybridized samples according to the
manufacturer’s protocol.
◦ Add detection reagent and incubate.
◦ Read the hybridization signals using the appropriate
detection system (e.g., Luminex platform).
F. Interpretation of Results
1. Analyze Data:
◦ Transfer raw data to the analysis software.
◦ Utilize the software to interpret the hybridization signals and
determine HLA typing results.
2. Quality Control:
◦ Ensure that positive and negative controls have expected
results.
◦ Verify that internal controls within each assay are within
acceptable limits.
3. Documentation and Reporting:
◦ Record all results in the laboratory information system.
◦ Review and validate results for accuracy and completeness.
◦ Report final HLA typing results according to laboratory
guidelines.
G. Quality Assurance and Troubleshooting
1. Control Assessment:
◦ Routinely monitor control performance.
◦ Address any deviations promptly.
2. Troubleshooting:
◦ If PCR amplification fails, verify reagent integrity and
thermocycler performance.
◦ If hybridization signals are weak or inconsistent, check the
hybridization conditions and probe quality.
