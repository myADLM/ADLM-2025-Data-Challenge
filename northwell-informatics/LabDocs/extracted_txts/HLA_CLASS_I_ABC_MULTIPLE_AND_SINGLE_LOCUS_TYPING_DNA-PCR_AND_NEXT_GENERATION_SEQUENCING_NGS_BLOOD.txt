Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for HLA Class I (ABC) Multiple
and Single Locus Typing DNA-PCR and Next Generation Sequencing
(NGS), Blood
1. PURPOSE:
The purpose of this Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is to
outline the process for HLA Class I (ABC) multiple and single locus
typing using DNA-PCR and Next Generation Sequencing (NGS)
techniques. This procedure is used to generate accurate and reliable
results for clinical and research applications.
1. RESPONSIBILITY:
• Laboratory staff members are responsible for following the
procedures outlined in this SOP.
• It is the responsibility of the quality control staff and supervisors to
ensure that the procedures are correctly implemented and that
any deviations or issues are documented and addressed.
• Timely communication of any problems arising during the
analytical phase to the laboratory manager or designee.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS:
• Specimen Type: Peripheral blood in EDTA tubes or ACD tubes.
• Volume: Minimum 5mL of peripheral blood.
• Storage: Specimens should be stored at 2-8°C and processed
within 72 hours of collection to ensure DNA integrity.
1. REAGENTS, SUPPLIES, AND EQUIPMENT:
• DNA isolation kit (validated specifically for extracting HLA typing
quality DNA).
• PCR reagents (primers, Taq polymerase, dNTPs, buffers).
• NGS Library Preparation Kit (encompassing adapters, indices,
enzymes).
• NGS platform (Illumina, Ion Torrent, etc.).
• Clean and calibrated pipettes.
• Sterile, nuclease-free pipette tips.
• PCR tubes/plates.
• Thermal cycler.
• Centrifuge with PCR plate rotor.
• Nucleic acid quantification device (e.g., Qubit, NanoDrop).
• Quality control standards and controls for HLA typing.
1. PROCEDURE:
A) DNA Isolation:
1. Isolate genomic DNA using a validated DNA extraction kit
according to manufacturer instructions.
2. Quantify DNA using a nucleic acid quantification device.
3. Normalize DNA concentration to 10ng/μL for PCR amplification.
B) PCR Amplification:
1. Prepare PCR master mix according to the recipe specified by
the HLA typing kit or laboratory-validated protocol.
2. Add 1-2μL of DNA template to each well of the PCR plate.
3. Perform PCR amplification as per the cycling conditions
specified for HLA Class I loci (A, B, C).
4. Confirm amplification success by running a small aliquot of
PCR product on an agarose gel.
C) Library Preparation for NGS:
1. Utilize an NGS Library Preparation Kit to ligate adapters and
indices to the PCR-amplified DNA.
2. Follow the library preparation protocol, including purification
steps, to obtain a final indexed library ready for sequencing.
D) Sequencing:
1. Quantify and normalize the prepared library.
2. Load the library onto the NGS platform.
3. Run the sequencing protocol specific to the platform being
used, ensuring the inclusion of necessary controls.
E) Data Analysis:
1. Use bioinformatics tools provided by NGS platform or other
validated means to align the sequencing reads to the reference
HLA sequences.
2. Call HLA alleles based on the aligned and annotated
sequencing data using reference aligners and HLA typing
software.
3. Review and interpret the HLA typing results.
4. Validate the sequencing results by comparing with known
controls and internal quality standards.
5. QUALITY CONTROL:
• Include positive and negative control samples in each run to
monitor the reagents and procedures.
• Regularly calibrate and maintain all equipment according to
manufacturer’s recommendations.
• Record temperature and maintenance logs for all equipment
involved in the procedure.
• Perform periodic proficiency testing and inter-laboratory
comparisons to ensure consistent and reliable results.
• Document all deviations from the process and corrective actions
taken.
1. REPORTING RESULTS:
• Verify all results by a qualified technologist before reporting.
• Enter the results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Interpret the results in conjunction with clinical information where
appropriate.
• Forward the final interpreted results to the requesting clinician or
researcher with any necessary interpretations or comments.
