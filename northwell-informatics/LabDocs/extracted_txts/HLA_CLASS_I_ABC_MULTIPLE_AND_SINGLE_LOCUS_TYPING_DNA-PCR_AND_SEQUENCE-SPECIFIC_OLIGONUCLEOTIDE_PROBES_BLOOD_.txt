Standard Operating Procedure for HLA Class I (ABC) Multiple
and Single Locus Typing Using DNA-PCR and Sequence-
Specific Oligonucleotide Probes, Blood
1. PURPOSE
To provide detailed instructions for the analytical phase of generating
results for HLA Class I (ABC) Multiple and Single Locus Typing from
whole blood utilizing DNA-PCR and Sequence-Specific
Oligonucleotide Probes (SSOP).
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for conducting HLA
Class I typing as per this SOP and ensuring accurate and reliable
results. Supervisors are responsible for overseeing the process and
addressing any deviations or issues that arise.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred Specimens:
◦ Whole blood collected in EDTA or ACD tubes.
◦ Transport blood specimens to the laboratory within 24 hours of
collection at ambient temperature (15-25°C).
• Unacceptable Specimens:
◦ Clotted blood.
◦ Specimens collected in heparin.
◦ Specimens received >24 hours post-collection.
◦ Specimens with unclear labeling or missing collection time/
date.
3. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• DNA extraction kit (e.g., Qiagen QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit)
• PCR reagents (e.g., Taq DNA polymerase, dNTPs, PCR buffer)
• Sequence-Specific Oligonucleotide Probes (SSOPs) for HLA
Class I loci (A, B, C)
• Thermal cycler
• Gel electrophoresis equipment
• Imaging system for gel documentation
• Positive and negative controls
• DNase/RNase-free water
• Molecular grade reagents and consumables
4. PROCEDURE
A) DNA Extraction:
1. Perform DNA extraction from whole blood using the designated
DNA extraction kit.
2. Follow the manufacturer's instructions, ensuring DNA purity and
concentration are adequate (typically at least 10 ng/µl).
3. Verify DNA integrity using agarose gel electrophoresis.
Document the DNA quality and quantity in the log.
B) PCR Amplification:
1. Prepare PCR master mix, including Taq DNA polymerase,
dNTPs, PCR buffer, and specific primers for HLA-A, HLA-B,
and HLA-C loci.
2. Aliquot the master mix into PCR tubes and add 2-5 µl of the
extracted DNA.
3. Include appropriate positive and negative controls in each run.
4. Set up the thermal cycler with the correct cycling parameters:
◦ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 5 minutes
◦ Denaturation: 95°C for 30 seconds
◦ Annealing: 55-65°C for 30 seconds (depending on primers)
◦ Extension: 72°C for 30 seconds
◦ Final extension: 72°C for 5 minutes
◦ Hold: 4°C
5. Run PCR for 30-35 cycles.
C) Hybridization and Detection Using SSOP:
1. Post-PCR, prepare PCR products for hybridization by
denaturing them at 95°C for 5 minutes followed by chilling them
on ice.
2. Apply the denatured products to the hybridization membrane
containing SSOPs.
3. Hybridize at the specific temperature (depending on probe
design) for 1-2 hours.
4. Wash the membrane to remove non-specifically bound probes.
5. Detect hybridized probes using appropriate detection systems
(e.g., colorimetric, chemiluminescent).
6. Assess the hybridization signals and compare them with the
interpretation guide provided by the probe manufacturer.
D) Gel Electrophoresis (for verification):
1. Load PCR products onto agarose gel.
2. Perform electrophoresis at consistent voltage (e.g., 100V for 45
minutes).
3. Visualize bands using an imaging system.
4. Document gel image and analyze bands for expected sizes
consistent with HLA Class I loci.
E) Result Interpretation and Reporting:
1. Integrate data from SSOP detection and gel electrophoresis.
2. Compare results with the reference HLA alleles and interpret
specific allele types.
3. Record results in the laboratory information system (LIS)
ensuring data accuracy.
4. Review by a qualified technologist and validate before release.
5. Report critical finding according to site-specific guidelines.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run positive controls (known HLA types) and negative controls
with each batch.
• Verify the quality of DNA and PCR products regularly.
• Ensure proper hybridization and detection by cross-checking
against standards.
• Document and review any troubleshooting steps taken for
resolving unexpected results.
