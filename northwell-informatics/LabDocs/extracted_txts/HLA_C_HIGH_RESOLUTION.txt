Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for HLA C High Resolution
Typing
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to provide standardized guidelines
for the high-resolution typing of HLA C locus using molecular
methods. High-resolution typing is crucial for applications such as
stem cell transplantation, organ transplantation, and disease
association studies.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of qualified laboratory personnel to follow this
protocol accurately and ensure all results are generated and reported
according to the guidelines.
1. DEFINITION
HLA C high resolution typing involves the precise determination of
HLA C alleles using sequence-based typing (SBT) and/or next-
generation sequencing (NGS) methods.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Acceptable Specimens:
• Whole blood collected in EDTA or ACD tubes.
• Buccal swabs/sticks.
• Isolated genomic DNA with appropriate concentration and purity
(A260/A280 ratio of 1:8-2:0).
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Samples exhibiting hemolysis.
• Samples with insufficient quantity or poor quality.
• Specimens collected in heparin tubes.
Specimen Stability:
• Whole blood: Stable for up to 72 hours when stored at 2-8°C.
• Buccal swabs: Stable for up to 7 days at room temperature.
• Isolated DNA: Stable indefinitely at -20°C or lower.
1. REAGENTS AND EQUIPMENT
Reagents:
• PCR primers specific for HLA C locus.
• DNA polymerase (e.g., Taq polymerase).
• Sequencing reagents (for Sanger sequencing) or sequencing kits
(for NGS).
• PCR buffer, dNTPs, and MgCl₂.
Equipment:
• Thermocycler.
• Gel electrophoresis apparatus.
• Capillary electrophoresis sequencer (Sanger) or NGS sequencer.
• Centrifuge, pipettes, and other standard laboratory equipment.
1. PROCEDURE
A. DNA Extraction:
1. Ensure that all samples and reagents are properly labeled.
2. Follow the appropriate DNA extraction protocol (e.g., column-
based, magnetic bead-based) for your sample type.
3. Measure the concentration and purity of extracted DNA using a
spectrophotometer or fluorometer.
B. PCR Amplification:
1. Prepare the PCR reaction mixture according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
2. Add the appropriate amount of DNA template to each PCR
reaction tube.
3. Place the tubes in the thermocycler and run the PCR using the
specified program parameters.
4. Verify the amplification success and product size by gel
electrophoresis.
C. Sequencing:
For Sanger Sequencing:
1. Purify the PCR products using a PCR purification kit.
2. Prepare the sequencing reactions with the purified PCR
products and sequencing primers.
3. Run the sequencing reactions on a capillary sequencer.
4. Analyze the sequencing data using sequence analysis
software, comparing results to the reference HLA sequence
database.
For Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS):
1. Follow the library preparation protocol provided with the NGS
sequencing kit.
2. Perform quality control checks on the prepared libraries and
quantify using a fluorometer.
3. Load the libraries onto the NGS sequencer and run the
appropriate sequencing program.
4. Analyze the sequencing data using specialized HLA typing
software, aligning reads to the reference HLA sequence
database.
D. Data Analysis and Interpretation:
1. Carefully review the sequences obtained for each sample.
2. Compare the sample sequences to the HLA reference database
to determine the HLA C alleles.
3. Perform allele assignment using HLA typing software to achieve
high-resolution typing.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include negative controls (no DNA template) in each run.
• Include positive controls with known HLA C alleles to verify the
accuracy of the typing.
• Use internal laboratory quality control measures to cross-check
results. Repeat the test if deviations are observed.
Internal Quality Control:
Three levels of quality control material should be included in every
run:
1. Normal/High Control.
2. Normal/Low Control.
3. Abnormal/Pathological Control.
QC materials should be evaluated and documented at regular
intervals (beginning, middle, and end of runs).
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Transmit the results from the sequencing analysis to the LIS
(Laboratory Information System) for review and verification.
• Document any discrepancies and inconclusive results and
request a repeat analysis if needed.
• Results should be reviewed and verified by the supervising
clinical technologist before reporting.
Critical Results:
• Immediate notification to the clinical team if a significant
histocompatibility mismatch is identified in transplant patients.

Note: This SOP should be reviewed and updated regularly to
incorporate new advancements in HLA typing technology and
methodologies.
