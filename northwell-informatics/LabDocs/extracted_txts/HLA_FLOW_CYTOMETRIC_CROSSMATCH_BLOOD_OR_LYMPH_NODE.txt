HLA: Flow Cytometric Crossmatch, Blood or Lymph Node SOP
1. PURPOSE
To provide a detailed step-by-step procedure for performing and
analyzing HLA Flow Cytometric Crossmatch (FCXM) using blood or
lymph node samples to detect HLA-specific antibodies in patients
awaiting organ transplantation. The FCXM assay helps identify the
presence of preformed donor-specific anti-HLA antibodies which may
inform donor-recipient compatibility.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
The trained and designated laboratory personnel are responsible for
performing the FCXM according to this procedure. It is their
responsibility to ensure all steps are followed meticulously, results are
accurately documented, and any discrepancies or issues are
promptly addressed and reported to the supervising laboratory staff.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
A. Blood Samples:
• Source: Donor and recipient
• Container: EDTA or ACD tubes
• Volume: 10-20 mL
• Transport: Room temperature
• Stability: Samples must be processed within 24 hours of collection
B. Lymph Node Samples:
• Source: Donor lymph node biopsy
• Container: RPMI media with heparin
• Transport: Maintain in a cold condition (~4°C)
• Stability: Processed within 24 hours of collection
1. REAGENTS AND EQUIPMENT
◦ RPMI media
◦ Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS)
◦ Anti-HLA antibodies (primary antibodies)
◦ Fluorochrome-conjugated secondary antibodies
◦ Antihuman globulin (if necessary)
◦ Flow Cytometer (calibrated and maintained)
◦ Centrifuge
◦ Vortex mixer
◦ Incubator (37°C)
◦ Humidified chamber
◦ Appropriate PPE (lab coat, gloves, safety glasses)
2. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation of Cells
1. Isolate donor T and B lymphocytes from peripheral blood or
lymph node using density gradient centrifugation.
2. Wash lymphocytes thoroughly with PBS and resuspend in
RPMI media to working concentration (1 x 10^6 cells/mL).
3. Separate cells into two aliquots: one for testing with the patient
serum and one for negative control using normal AB serum.
B. Incubation with Patient Serum
1. Add 50 µL patient serum to 150 µL of donor lymphocyte
suspension.
2. Incubate for 30 minutes at 37°C.
3. Wash cells twice with PBS to remove unbound antibodies.
C. Incubation with Secondary Fluorescent Antibody
1. Add 100 µL of fluorochrome-conjugated secondary antibody to
the cell suspension.
2. Incubate for 30 minutes at 4°C in the dark.
3. Wash cells twice with PBS and resuspend in 300 µL PBS.
D. Flow Cytometry Analysis
1. Transfer cells to flow cytometry tubes and analyze on a
calibrated flow cytometer.
2. Collect data for at least 10,000 cells per sample.
3. Evaluate the geometric mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of
each sample.
4. Compare MFI of patient-serum-reacted lymphocytes to control
and determine positivity threshold.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Include positive and negative control sera in each
experiment to validate the assay.
◦ Run isotype controls to account for nonspecific binding.
◦ Perform daily calibration and validation of flow cytometer
using standard beads.
◦ Document all controls and calibrations in the QC log.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ Analyze data meticulously ensuring consistency and
accuracy.
◦ Record both qualitative (positive/negative) and quantitative
(MFI values) results.
◦ Provide interpretative comments based on institutional
reference ranges and standards.
◦ Flag any discrepancies or unexpected results for review by
the supervisor.
7. TROUBLESHOOTING
◦ If MFI values are anomalously high or low, re-check reagent
quality and repeat the FCXM.
◦ If cell viability is compromised, ensure fresh samples and
correct storage conditions.
◦ Ensure flow cytometer is functioning correctly, recalibrate if
necessary.
8. DOCUMENTATION
◦ Record all protocol steps followed, reagent batch numbers,
sample IDs, and results in the laboratory information system
(LIS).
◦ Maintain training records to ensure all personnel are
proficient in the FCXM protocol.
