Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
1. PURPOSE
To define the process, responsibility, and actions involved in the
analytical phase of generating results for HLA: Narcolepsy Panel
(DR/DQ High Resolution Typing) using blood specimens. This
procedure will ensure consistency, accuracy, and reliability of test
results.
Responsibility: The laboratory personnel are responsible for carrying
out the procedures as defined. The supervisor is responsible for
reviewing and validating test results, as well as overseeing the
adherence to the described procedures.
1. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel involved in the
analytical phase of HLA: Narcolepsy Panel (DR/DQ High Resolution
Typing).
1. DEFINITIONS AND ABBREVIATIONS
HLA: Human Leukocyte Antigen DR/DQ: HLA-DR and HLA-DQ, gene
loci known for their association with narcolepsy PCR: Polymerase
Chain Reaction SSP: Sequence-Specific Primer SSO: Sequence-
Specific Oligonucleotide RT: Room Temperature
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred Specimen:
• 5-10 mL of peripheral blood in EDTA, ACD, or heparin tube.
Specimen Handling:
• Ensure the sample is labeled with at least two patient identifiers.
• Store specimens at 2-8°C if analysis is not performed
immediately.
• Specimen must be analyzed within 7 days of collection.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Thermocycler
• Centrifuge
• Micropipettes and sterile tips
• PCR reagents including Taq polymerase, dNTPs, primers
• Agarose gel electrophoresis apparatus and reagents
• DNA extraction kit (e.g., Qiagen)
• HLA typing kit (commercially available, e.g., One Lambda
LABType® HD Class II)
• Ethanol, sterile water, and other necessary lab consumables
1. PROCEDURE
I. Preparation of Reagents and Equipment:
• Prepare PCR master mix following the instructions in the HLA
typing kit.
• Calibrate the PCR thermocycler as per manufacturer's guidelines.
• Prepare agarose gel for electrophoresis.
II. DNA Extraction:
• Extract genomic DNA from peripheral blood using a DNA
extraction kit.
• Measure DNA concentration and purity using a
spectrophotometer (A260/A280 ratio should be approximately
1.8-2.0).
III. DNA Amplification by PCR:
• Set up PCR reactions using the Sequence-Specific Primers
provided in the HLA typing kit.
• Include positive and negative controls with each batch of
samples.
• Perform PCR amplification following the recommended cycling
conditions outlined by the kit’s manufacturer.
IV. Post-PCR Processing:
• Analyze the PCR products through agarose gel electrophoresis.
• Visualize the results under UV light after staining with ethidium
bromide or a safer alternative.
V. Hybridization and Detection:
• Perform hybridization reactions using Sequence-Specific
Oligonucleotide probes as per kit instructions.
• Wash and visualize hybridized probes using chemiluminescent
substrates or fluorescence.
VI. Interpretation of Results:
• Interpret the hybridization patterns using the kit’s reference guide
and software.
• Include relevant quality control checks as indicated in the
procedure to ensure result accuracy.
• Record all interpretations in the laboratory information system
(LIS).
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Positive and negative controls must be run with each batch of
samples and meet expected results.
• Document control results and verify that they fall within
acceptable ranges.
• Perform proficiency testing and regular maintenance of all
equipment used.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Verify results through secondary review by a senior technologist
or supervisor.
• Document and report results through LIS.
• Report any discrepancies, errors, or unexpected patterns to the
supervisor immediately for resolution.
1. SAMPLE INTEGRITY
• Examine all post-PCR and hybridization products for integrity.
• Re-extract or re-test samples if any issues with DNA quality or
amplification are detected, & document any anomalies.
1. CRITICAL RESULTS
• Critical results will be reviewed and discussed with a clinical
pathologist before release.
• Document the communication and resolution of any critical values
as per laboratory policy.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions for the HLA typing kit (One Lambda
LABType® HD Class II User Manual).
• Guidelines established by the Clinical Laboratory Improvement
Amendments (CLIA) and the American Society for
Histocompatibility and Immunogenetics (ASHI).
1. REVISION HISTORY
• Date of last revision: [MM/DD/YYYY]
• Date of next review: [MM/DD/YYYY]
This SOP will be reviewed annually or as needed based on updates
in laboratory practices or guidelines.
