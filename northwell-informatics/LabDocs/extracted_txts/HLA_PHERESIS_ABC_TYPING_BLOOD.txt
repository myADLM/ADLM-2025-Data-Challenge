Protocol: HLA: PHERESIS ABC TYPING, BLOOD
1. PURPOSE
To provide a detailed and standardized method for the analytical
phase in generating HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C typing results using
blood samples collected via phlebotomy for patients requiring HLA
typing for therapeutic apheresis.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory personnel trained in molecular HLA typing
techniques will perform, monitor, and document the HLA typing
procedures. It is the responsibility of the entire laboratory team to
ensure the integrity of the samples and the accuracy of the results.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Acceptable Specimen:
• Freshly collected EDTA-anticoagulated whole blood samples,
collected using standard phlebotomy techniques.
• Specimens must be submitted in appropriately labeled tubes
containing the patient's details, date, and collection time.
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Samples with hemolysis, clots, or insufficient volume.
• Samples without proper labeling or identification.
• Samples received at the laboratory beyond 72 hours post-
collection.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Laminar flow hood
• Centrifuge
• Thermal cycler (PCR machine)
• Gel electrophoresis apparatus
• Microplate reader
• Vortex mixer
• Pipettes and pipette tips
Reagents:
• DNA extraction kits
• PCR reagents (primers, Taq polymerase, dNTPs, buffer)
• Electrophoresis buffers and gels
• Ethidium bromide or an equivalent DNA stain
• HLA typing kits specific for HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C loci
Supplies:
• EDTA tubes
• Sterile microcentrifuge tubes
• PCR tubes
• Pipette tips (filtered)
• Gloves and other personal protective equipment (PPE)
• DNA ladder/size markers
4. PROCEDURE
A. DNA Extraction:
1. Prepare the sample by thoroughly mixing the EDTA whole blood
specimen.
2. Aliquot 200 µL of blood into a sterile microcentrifuge tube.
3. Use the DNA extraction kit according to the manufacturer’s
protocol to isolate genomic DNA.
4. Measure the concentration and purity of the extracted DNA
using a microplate reader or spectrophotometer.
5. Store the extracted DNA at -20°C until ready for PCR
amplification.
B. Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR):
1. Prepare the PCR master mix as follows for each locus (HLA-A,
HLA-B, HLA-C):
◦ DNA template: 50-100 ng
◦ Forward and reverse primers: 10 pmol each
◦ Taq polymerase: 1 unit
◦ dNTPs: 200 µM each
◦ 10X Taq buffer: as per manufacturer’s specification
◦ MgCl2: as required (usually 1.5-2.5 mM)
◦ Nuclease-free water to bring the final volume to 50 µL.
2. Dispense the master mix into individual PCR tubes and run the
following thermal cycling profile: Initial denaturation: 95°C for 5
minutes 35 cycles of:
◦ Denaturation: 95°C for 30 seconds
◦ Annealing: 55-65°C (optimized for each primer set) for 30
seconds
◦ Extension: 72°C for 1 minute Final extension: 72°C for 10
minutes Hold: 4°C
C. Agarose Gel Electrophoresis:
1. Prepare a 2% agarose gel with ethidium bromide or a suitable
alternative stain.
2. Load PCR products with loading dye into the gel wells along
with a DNA ladder.
3. Run the electrophoresis at 100V for approximately 30-45
minutes.
4. Visualize the bands using a UV transilluminator.
D. Interpretation and Reporting:
1. Compare the band patterns to the expected sizes based on the
HLA typing kit specifications.
2. Document the results in the laboratory information system
(LIS), ensuring accuracy in matching the band sizes to the HLA
alleles.
3. Review and validate the results by a qualified laboratory
personnel.
4. Generate a comprehensive report and transmit results to the
patient's electronic medical record for physician review.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Perform quality control (QC) with each batch of HLA typing:
◦ Include positive and negative controls to ensure proper PCR
amplification and specificity.
◦ Run repeat samples and compare results to validate
accuracy.
2. Document all QC activities and address any discrepancies prior
to releasing patient results.
6. TROUBLESHOOTING
1. If no bands or unexpected bands appear:
◦ Verify the integrity of the DNA template.
◦ Check the function of PCR reagents and equipment
calibration.
◦ Repeat amplification with adjusted PCR conditions if
necessary.
2. In case of contamination:
◦ Clean instruments and work surfaces with appropriate
disinfectants.
◦ Replace potentially contaminated reagents.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Verify all results and ensure they are entered into the LIS
accurately.
2. Provide concise and clear results to the requesting clinician
including relevant HLA alleles.
