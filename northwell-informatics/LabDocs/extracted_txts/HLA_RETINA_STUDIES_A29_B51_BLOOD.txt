Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Generating Results for
HLA: RETINA STUDIES (A29/B51), BLOOD
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to delineate the steps and responsibilities
required to generate accurate and reliable results for HLA: RETINA
STUDIES (A29/B51) in human blood samples. This SOP ensures
that laboratory operations align with CLIA regulations and good
clinical laboratory practices (GCLP).
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for adhering to this
SOP in order to ensure the accuracy and reliability of generated
results.
1. DEFINITIONS
• HLA (Human Leukocyte Antigen): A group of related proteins
that help the immune system identify foreign substances.
• RETINA STUDIES (A29/B51): Molecular tests used to identify
specific HLA alleles, namely A29 and B51, associated with retinal
diseases, such as Birdshot chorioretinopathy.
• PCR: Polymerase Chain Reaction, a method used for amplifying
DNA sequences.
• SSO: Sequence-Specific Oligonucleotide probes, used in DNA
hybridization assays to detect specific DNA sequences.
• SSP: Sequence-Specific Primers, used in PCR for specific DNA
amplification.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
• Specimen Type: Peripheral blood collected in EDTA
(ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) tubes.
• Specimen Volume: Minimum volume of 3 mL whole blood.
• Transport: Specimens should be transported at 2-8°C and
processed within 48 hours of collection.
• Unacceptable Specimens: Specimens that are hemolyzed,
clotted, collected in non-EDTA tubes, or transported/stored
outside temperature and time specifications.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• DNA Extraction Kits: For example, Qiagen QIAamp DNA Blood
Mini Kit.
• PCR Thermal Cyclers: For DNA amplification.
• HLA Typing Kits: Such as Olerup SSP® Kits for HLA-A29 and
HLA-B51 detection.
• PCR Buffers and Enzymes: Specifically matched to the required
PCR conditions.
• Gel Electrophoresis Equipment: For the visualization of PCR
products.
• Agarose Gel: For electrophoresis.
• Ethidium Bromide: or other suitable DNA stains.
• DNA Ladder: For molecular weight reference.
• Nuclease-Free Water: For reagent preparation.
1. PROCEDURE
A. DNA Extraction:
1. Label Specimens: Clearly label each specimen with a unique
ID.
2. Lysis: Add the appropriate volume of blood to the lysis buffer
provided in the DNA extraction kit.
3. Column Binding: Following the kit protocol, bind DNA to the
column.
4. Wash Steps: Wash the column with the provided wash buffers.
5. Elution: Elute the DNA in an appropriate volume of nuclease-
free water.
6. Quantitation: Measure DNA concentration using a NanoDrop
spectrophotometer or similar device.
B. PCR Amplification:
1. Prepare PCR Mix: According to HLA Typing Kit instructions,
prepare the master mix including primers, nuclease-free water,
and Taq polymerase.
2. Aliquot DNA: Add an appropriate volume of extracted DNA to
each PCR mix tube.
3. Cycling Conditions: Load the tubes into the thermal cycler.
Follow the cycling program specified in the HLA Typing Kit
instructions.
4. Control Reactions: Include positive and negative controls to
ensure PCR validity.
C. Gel Electrophoresis:
1. Prepare Gel: Pour agarose gel at the appropriate
concentration; usually, 2-3% agarose in TAE or TBE buffer.
2. Load Samples: Mix PCR products with gel loading buffer and
load into gel wells.
3. Electrophoresis: Run the gel at 100-120V until the dye front
has migrated a suitable distance.
4. Visualization: Stain the gel with ethidium bromide or another
suitable DNA stain, and visualize under UV light.
5. Interpretation: Compare bands with the DNA ladder and
control reactions.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Reagent Quality Control: Validate all reagents prior to use by
running control reactions.
• Positive and Negative Controls: Include in every test batch.
• Reproducibility: Ensure at least duplicates for each sample/test.
• Documentation: Record all results in the laboratory information
system (LIS).
1. DATA ANALYSIS and REPORTING
2. Data Review: Verify raw data for each run and interpret results
according to kit guidelines.
3. Result Entry: Enter results into the LIS, ensuring to include
specimen ID and test details.
4. Data Validation: Validate results by a second trained
technologist.
5. Report Generation: Generate the final report and transmit it to
the requesting physician or facility.
6. MAINTENANCE AND CALIBRATION
• Equipment Maintenance: Regularly calibrate and maintain PCR
thermal cyclers, spectrophotometers, and gel electrophoresis
apparatus according to manufacturer instructions.
• Recordkeeping: Maintain logs for all equipment calibration and
maintenance activities.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING
• No PCR Products: Check DNA quality/quantity, reagent expiry
dates, and thermal cycler conditions.
• Non-specific Bands: Re-optimize primer concentrations and
annealing temperatures.
• Weak Signals: Increase DNA template or review PCR
amplification conditions.
