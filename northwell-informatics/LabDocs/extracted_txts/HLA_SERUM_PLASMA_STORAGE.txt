STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE
Title: Analytical Phase Protocol for HLA: Serum/Plasma Storage
1. PURPOSE
This procedure outlines the correct process for handling, storing, and
documenting serum and plasma samples for Human Leukocyte
Antigen (HLA) testing. This ensures the integrity and stability of the
samples from initial processing through to analysis.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel involved in
preparing, storing, and handling serum and plasma samples for HLA
testing.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all laboratory personnel to follow this
protocol. The laboratory supervisor or designated senior staff is
responsible for ensuring compliance with this protocol and for
addressing any issues that arise during the process.
4. DEFINITIONS
• HLA: Human Leukocyte Antigen, a key part of the immune
system used for various types of compatibility testing.
• Serum: The liquid part of blood that remains after clotting has
taken place, devoid of cells and clotting factors.
• Plasma: The liquid part of blood that remains when
anticoagulation is used, containing clotting factors.
• Centrifugation: A process by which a centrifuge is used to
separate components of blood.
5. PROCEDURE
5.1 Specimen Preparation
• Collection:
◦ Serum: Collect blood using a serum separator tube (SST).
Allow blood to clot at room temperature for 30 minutes.
◦ Plasma: Collect blood using an EDTA or lithium heparin
vacutainer. Invert tubes gently 8-10 times to ensure proper
mixing of the anticoagulant.
• Centrifugation:
◦ Serum: Centrifuge the SST tube at 1300-2000g for 10 minutes
at room temperature.
◦ Plasma: Centrifuge the plasma tube at 1300-2000g for 10
minutes at room temperature.
5.2 Serum/Plasma Aliquoting
• Carefully transfer the serum/plasma into labeled polypropylene or
cryovials, ensuring no red blood cells are transferred. Use a
disposable pipette and avoid generating bubbles during the
transfer.
5.3 Storage
• Short-term storage:
◦ Label each vial with the patient’s identification, sample type
(serum or plasma), date of collection, and time of
centrifugation.
◦ Store vials at 4°C for up to 72 hours.
• Long-term storage:
◦ For long-term storage, store labeled vials at -20°C or lower.
Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles to maintain sample
integrity. Ensure the freezer is dedicated to human diagnostic
samples and aligned with acceptable laboratory tolerance
limits for ultra-low freezers (-75±15°C).
• Documentation:
◦ Record storage details in the laboratory information system
(LIS) or relevant tracking log, including sample ID, storage
location, and any relevant dates (e.g., collection,
centrifugation).
5.4 Quality Control
• Temperature Monitoring:
◦ Monitor and record the temperatures of storage equipment
daily using a calibrated thermometer. Ensure all logs include
the date, time, and initials of the staff member performing the
check.
• Sample Quality Monitoring:
◦ Perform periodic checks on stored samples for any evidence
of degradation, hemolysis, or contamination. Document
findings and any corrective actions.
5.5 Retrieval for Analysis
• When retrieving serum/plasma samples for analysis, ensure that
samples are properly thawed at room temperature and any
remaining sample is promptly returned to appropriate storage
conditions.
6. RECORDS MANAGEMENT
• Maintain all temperature logs, transfer documentation, and
sample quality checks as per laboratory policy. Ensure all records
are accurate, legible, and retrievable when required.
7. REFERENCES
• HLA testing assay package inserts.
• Manufacturer instructions for centrifuges and storage equipment.
• Relevant laboratory quality manuals and safety guidelines.
ADDITIONAL NOTES
• Staff must follow all health and safety protocols when handling
human samples, including the use of personal protective
equipment (PPE).
• Adhere to any additional regulatory and accreditation standards
related to HLA testing and sample storage.
By following this protocol, laboratory personnel will ensure that the
integrity of serum/plasma samples for HLA testing is maintained,
thereby supporting accurate and reliable test results.
