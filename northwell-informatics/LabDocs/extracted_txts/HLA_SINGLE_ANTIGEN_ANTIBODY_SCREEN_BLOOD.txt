SOP: HLA: Single Antigen Antibody Screen, Blood
1. PURPOSE: The purpose of this SOP is to describe the
procedure for performing HLA (Human Leukocyte Antigen)
single antigen antibody screening on blood specimens. This
protocol ensures accurate and consistent results for assessing
the presence of HLA antibodies, which is critical for organ
transplantation compatibility and immunological research.
2. SCOPE: This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel
trained to perform HLA single antigen antibody screening in a
CLIA-certified laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY:
• Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for conducting
the HLA single antigen antibody screening as outlined in this
procedure.
• The laboratory supervisor is responsible for ensuring that all
personnel are trained and proficient in performing this test.
• It is the responsibility of all staff to ensure adherence to this SOP
and to document any deviations or issues that arise during the
procedure.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS:
• Preferred Specimen:
◦ 5-10 ml of peripheral blood collected in a plain red top tube
(without anticoagulant) or serum separator tube (SST).
• Unacceptable Specimen:
◦ Hemolyzed, lipemic or icteric specimens.
◦ Specimens received in heparinized, EDTA, or other
anticoagulant tubes.
1. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES:
• Single Antigen Bead assay kit (e.g., Luminex® technology-based
platform)
• PBS buffer, pH 7.4
• 10% Normal Goat Serum (Blocking agent)
• Wash buffer (supplied in the assay kit)
• Detection antibody (supplied in the assay kit)
• Luminex® analyzer or equivalent
1. EQUIPMENT:
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes and filtered tips
• Vortex mixer
• Incubator (37°C)
• Luminex® analyzer or equivalent
1. PROCEDURE:
A. Preparation of Specimen: - Allow the collected blood specimen to
clot by standing at room temperature for 30-60 minutes. - Centrifuge
the specimen at 1500 x g for 10 minutes to separate the serum. -
Aliquot the serum into a clean tube, avoiding disruption of any cellular
components.
B. Pre-assay Preparation: - Thaw reagents and samples at room
temperature if previously frozen. - Ensure all reagents and supplies
are available and ready for use. - Perform all procedures at room
temperature unless otherwise specified.
C. Assay Procedure:
1. Bead Preparation:
◦ Vortex the single antigen beads thoroughly.
◦ Pipette a specified volume (as per manufacturer's
instructions) of single antigen beads into each well of a 96-
well plate.
2. Blocking Step:
◦ Add 10% Normal Goat Serum to each well to block
nonspecific binding.
◦ Incubate the plate at room temperature for 30 minutes.
3. Serum Incubation:
◦ Dilute patient serum in PBS buffer as per the manufacturer's
instructions.
◦ Add the diluted serum to the wells containing the single
antigen beads.
◦ Incubate the plate at 37°C for 1 hour with gentle shaking.
4. Wash Steps:
◦ Wash the beads in each well with wash buffer supplied in
the assay kit.
◦ Perform at least three washing steps to remove unbound
antibodies.
5. Detection Antibody Incubation:
◦ Add the detection antibody (e.g., PE-conjugated secondary
antibody) to each well.
◦ Incubate the plate at room temperature for 30 minutes with
gentle shaking.
6. Final Wash Step:
◦ Wash the beads thoroughly to remove excess detection
antibody.
◦ Resuspend the beads in the appropriate buffer as per the
manufacturer’s instructions.
D. Data Acquisition:
• Load the prepared plate onto the Luminex® analyzer.
• Acquire data using the Luminex® software by setting up the
parameters as per manufacturer’s guidelines.
• Ensure calibration and quality control beads are run prior to
sample acquisition.
E. Data Analysis:
• Analyze the data using specific HLA antibody analysis software.
• Report the presence or absence of antibodies against individual
HLA antigens based on fluorescence intensities.
• Review, interpret and validate the results according to laboratory
guidelines and acceptance criteria.
1. QUALITY CONTROL:
• Include positive and negative control sera in each assay run to
ensure the validity of the assay.
• Review all control results to ensure they fall within the established
acceptable ranges.
• Troubleshoot and resolve any quality control failures before
reporting patient results.
1. REPORTING RESULTS:
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
following the laboratory’s reporting guidelines.
• Ensure that all results are reviewed and verified by a qualified
laboratory technologist or supervisor.
1. REFERENCES:
• Manufacturer’s instructions for the single antigen bead assay kit.
• Luminex® instrument user manual.
• Clinical guidelines for HLA antibody screening and identification.
1. SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS:
• Follow all standard biosafety and chemical safety guidelines.
• Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) at all
times during the procedure.
• Handle all specimens as potentially infectious materials.
By adhering to this SOP, the laboratory ensures the accuracy,
reliability, and reproducibility of HLA single antigen antibody
screening results, thereby maintaining high standards in patient care
and laboratory practice.
