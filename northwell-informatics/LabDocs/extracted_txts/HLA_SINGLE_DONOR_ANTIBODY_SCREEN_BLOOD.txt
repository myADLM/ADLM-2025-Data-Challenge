HLA: SINGLE DONOR ANTIBODY SCREEN, BLOOD
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is to
outline the analytical procedures for performing a Single Donor
Antibody Screen for Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) using
blood specimens. This assay detects the presence of
antibodies directed against HLA antigens, which is critical for
pre-transplant compatibility testing and monitoring post-
transplant patients.
2. SCOPE
This protocol applies to all laboratory personnel trained and
authorized to perform HLA antibody screening using blood
specimens.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory personnel to:
◦ Ensure proper handling and testing of specimens.
◦ Perform and document the test according to the SOP.
◦ Report results accurately and in a timely manner.
◦ Perform quality control procedures as outlined in this
document.
◦ Notify the supervisor of any irregularities or issues
encountered during the procedure.
4. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS
◦ Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE)
including lab coat, gloves, and eye protection.
◦ Handle all specimens as potentially infectious material.
◦ Dispose of waste materials according to biohazard waste
disposal protocols.
5. DEFINITIONS
◦ HLA (Human Leukocyte Antigen): Molecules found on the
surface of cells that play a crucial role in immune system
function.
◦ Antibody Screen: Testing procedure to detect the presence
of antibodies against specific antigens.
6. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
◦ Acceptable Specimen: Whole blood collected in EDTA
(lavender-top) tubes. Minimum volume: 5 mL.
◦ Specimen Stability: Specimens must be tested within 24
hours of collection. If not tested immediately, store at 2-8°C
and process within 48 hours.
7. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
◦ Equipment:
▪ Centrifuge
▪ ELISA plate reader
▪ Incubator
▪ Pipettes and pipette tips
◦ Reagents:
▪ HLA-specific antibody screening kits (manufacturer-
specific, follow the kit insert for preparation)
▪ Wash buffer
▪ Substrate solution
▪ Stop solution
◦ Supplies:
▪ 96-well microplates
▪ Microplate seals
▪ Reagent reservoirs
▪ Timer
8. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Preparation
1. Allow the blood specimen to clot by leaving it undisturbed
at room temperature (if serum is required by the specific
kit) or proceed directly if plasma is required.
2. Centrifuge the blood specimen at 1500 x g for 10 minutes
at room temperature.
3. Carefully transfer the serum or plasma to a clean tube,
avoiding contamination with cells.
B. Reagent Preparation
1. Prepare reagents as indicated in the manufacturer’s
instructions for the specific HLA antibody screening kit.
2. Equilibrate all reagents and samples to room temperature
before use.
C. Assay Setup and Execution
1. Add appropriate control and patient serum/plasma
samples to designated wells of the microplate as
instructed in the kit manual.
2. Incubate the plates at 37°C for 30-60 minutes (follow the
kit instructions for specific incubation times).
3. Wash the plates thoroughly with the wash buffer to
remove unbound antibodies.
4. Add the enzyme-conjugated secondary antibody to each
well and incubate as per manufacturer’s instructions.
5. Perform another round of washing to remove unbound
conjugate.
6. Add substrate solution to each well and incubate until
color development is visible.
7. Add stop solution to terminate the reaction.
8. Immediately read the absorbance at the specified
wavelength using a microplate reader.
D. Interpretation of Results
1. Calculate the absorbance or Optical Density (OD)
according to the instructions provided with the test kit.
2. Compare the OD values of the samples to those of the
controls and the provided cut-off value(s) to determine the
presence of HLA antibodies.
3. Record and document the findings appropriately.
9. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Run internal controls (positive and negative) with each batch
of samples tested.
◦ Review control results before processing patient results to
ensure assay validity.
◦ Perform proficiency testing and participate in external quality
assurance programs regularly.
10. REPORTING RESULTS
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS) for
review.
• Ensure results are reviewed and verified by a qualified
technologist before reporting.
• Notify the requesting physician of critical results immediately as
per laboratory protocol.

Upon completion of tests and verification, the results should be
reported following the laboratory's predefined format and standard.
Any issues or deviations from expected outcomes should be
documented, and corrective actions taken should be reviewed and
implemented as necessary.
