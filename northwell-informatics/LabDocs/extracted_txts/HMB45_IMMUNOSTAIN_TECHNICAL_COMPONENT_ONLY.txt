SOP for HMB45 Immunostain, Technical Component Only
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the technical procedure for performing the HMB45
immunostain test to ensure accurate and reliable results in a Clinical
Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-certified laboratory.
Responsibility:
All designated histotechnologists are responsible for performing
HMB45 immunostain according to this protocol. It is the responsibility
of the laboratory supervisor to ensure compliance and address any
deficiencies.
1. DEFINITIONS
HMB45: An immunohistochemical marker used to identify melanoma
and other related tumor cells. Immunostain: A staining technique
used to visualize specific antigens in tissues by binding antibodies to
them.
1. SPECIMEN
Samples: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections are
required for HMB45 staining.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Microtome
• Water bath
• Staining racks
• Incubators
• Light microscope
Reagents:
• HMB45 primary antibody
• Secondary antibody (typically HRP-conjugated)
• Detection system (e.g., DAB substrate)
• Retrieval solution (e.g., citrate buffer)
• Wash buffer (e.g., PBS)
• Counterstain (e.g., hematoxylin)
Supplies:
• Glass slides
• Coverslips
• Forceps
• Slide staining jar
1. PROCEDURE
A) Slide Preparation
1. Cut 4 µm sections from paraffin-embedded tissue using a
microtome.
2. Place sections onto positively charged glass slides and
incubate at 60°C for 1 hour to adhere the tissue.
B) Deparaffinization and Rehydration
1. Deparaffinize slides by placing in xylene for 3 x 5 minutes.
2. Rehydrate through graded alcohols (100%, 95%, 70%) for 2
minutes each.
3. Rinse slides in distilled water.
C) Antigen Retrieval
1. Place slides in citrate buffer solution and heat in a microwave or
pressure cooker for antigen retrieval.
2. Allow slides to cool to room temperature (~20 minutes).
3. Wash in PBS solution for 3 x 5 minutes.
D) Staining Procedure
1. Block endogenous peroxidase by incubating slides in hydrogen
peroxide solution for 10 minutes.
2. Incubate slides with HMB45 primary antibody diluted as per
manufacturer’s instructions.
3. Rinse in PBS for 3 x 5 minutes.
4. Apply secondary antibody and incubate as per manufacturer’s
protocol.
5. Wash slides in PBS for 3 x 5 minutes.
6. Incubate slides with DAB substrate until desired staining
intensity is achieved.
7. Wash slides in distilled water.
E) Counterstaining
1. Counterstain slides by immersing in hematoxylin for 1-2
minutes.
2. Rinse slides in distilled water.
3. Dehydrate through graded alcohols (70%, 95%, 100%) for 2
minutes each.
4. Clear in xylene for 3 x 5 minutes.
F) Mounting
1. Place coverslips over stained sections using mounting medium.
2. QUALITY CONTROL
3. Positive control: Include a slide known to express HMB45
antigen.
4. Negative control: Include a slide processed without primary
antibody to check for nonspecific staining.
5. Document results of control staining and address any
deviations or issues.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
• The stained slides should be reviewed by a qualified pathologist
for interpretation.
• Technical staff must ensure proper documentation of the staining
process.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to the HMB45 antibody product insert for specific reagent
limitations and potential interferences.

This protocol ensures the consistent and accurate performance of
HMB45 immunostaining, facilitating reliable detection of melanoma
and related tumors in histology samples.
