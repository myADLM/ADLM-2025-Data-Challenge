Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Analytical Phase for
Generating Results for Homocysteine (Total), Methylmalonic
Acid, and Methylcitric Acid from Blood Spot
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedures for generating and documenting results for
Homocysteine (Total), Methylmalonic Acid, and Methylcitric Acid from
blood spot specimens. This SOP ensures accurate, reliable, and
consistent analysis through strict adherence to established
guidelines.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for conducting the
analysis and ensuring all quality control measures are adhered to. It
is the responsibility of all staff to report any discrepancies or
deviations to the supervisor and implement appropriate corrective
actions.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Acceptable:
◦ Blood spots collected on filter paper, dried thoroughly.
◦ Collection date and time must be indicated on the specimen
card.
Unacceptable:
◦ Blood spots that are not dried completely.
◦ Specimen cards with no collection date/time.
◦ Damaged or contaminated specimens.
◦ Blood spots that are excessively layered or inadequately
soaked through the filter paper.
2. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
Equipment:
◦ High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) System
or Tandem Mass Spectrometer (MS/MS)
◦ Microplate reader for quantitative analysis
◦ Incubators
◦ Centrifuge
◦ Pipettes and tips
◦ Sonicator
Reagents:
◦ Extraction solvent (e.g., methanol/water mixture)
◦ Calibration standards for Homocysteine, Methylmalonic
Acid, and Methylcitric Acid
◦ Internal standards
◦ Quality Control (QC) material
◦ Reagent blanks and controls
3. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation for Analysis:
1. Calibration and Controls:
◦ Prepare calibration standards for Homocysteine,
Methylmalonic Acid, and Methylcitric Acid.
◦ Prepare internal standards and QC material.
◦ Ensure all reagents and standards are within expiry dates
and stored according to manufacturer specifications.
2. Sample Preparation:
◦ Punch a precise portion of the blood spot (e.g., 3mm
diameter punch) and place it into a microcentrifuge tube.
◦ Add a pre-determined volume of internal standard solution
to each sample.
◦ Add the extraction solvent to the samples, ensuring the
volume sufficiently covers the blood spot.
3. Extraction:
◦ Vortex mix the tubes to ensure thorough mixing.
◦ Sonicate the samples for 10 minutes to enhance analyte
extraction.
◦ Centrifuge the samples at 10,000 RPM for 10 minutes.
◦ Transfer the supernatant to a clean microcentrifuge tube,
avoiding disturbance of any pellet formed.
B. Analysis:
1. Instrumental Setup:
◦ Calibrate the HPLC or MS/MS system using the prepared
calibration standards.
◦ Ensure instrument calibration and performance meet
acceptable criteria before running samples.
2. Sample Injection and Analysis:
◦ Load the extracted samples into the auto-sampler.
◦ Set up the HPLC or MS/MS method specific to the analytes
of interest.
◦ Inject an adequate volume of each sample and run the
method.
3. Data Acquisition and Processing:
◦ Collect chromatographic or mass spectrometric data for
each injection.
◦ Analyze the data using the instrument’s software to quantify
Homocysteine, Methylmalonic Acid, and Methylcitric Acid.
◦ Compare sample results against calibration curves for
quantification.
C. Post-Analysis:
1. Quality Control:
◦ Evaluate the results of QC materials and ensure they fall
within the acceptable range.
◦ Re-run samples and controls if QC results do not meet
specifications.
2. Result Validation:
◦ Review and validate results before reporting. Ensure no
data discrepancies.
◦ Apply any relevant correction factors as needed based on
calibration and QC outcome.
3. Documentation:
◦ Record all sample results, QC outcomes, and any
deviations observed during the analysis.
◦ Ensure complete and accurate documentation for
traceability.
4. REPORTING RESULTS
• Enter validated results into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
• Ensure all results meet the criteria outlined in the reporting
section before release.
• Refer to site-specific guidelines for reporting protocols and critical
value communication.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Conduct regular QC checks using known control materials.
• Perform daily instrument performance checks and maintenance
as per the manufacturer's guidelines.
• Record all QC and maintenance activities appropriately.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Homocysteine: 5–15 µmol/L
• Methylmalonic Acid: <0.4 µmol/L
• Methylcitric Acid: <10 µmol/L
