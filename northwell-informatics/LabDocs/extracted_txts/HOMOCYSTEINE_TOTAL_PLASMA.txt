Standard Operating Procedure
(SOP)
Title: Homocysteine, Total, Plasma -
Analytical Phase Protocol
Effective Date: [Insert Date]
Review Date: [Insert Date]
Version: 1.0
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this protocol is to outline the standardized procedure
for the analytical phase of generating results for Homocysteine, Total,
Plasma using laboratory equipment, reagents, and techniques to
ensure accuracy, precision, and reliability of the test results.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel specifically trained and
authorized to perform Homocysteine, Total, Plasma assays in the
CLIA-certified laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the laboratory staff to perform and document
all steps of the procedure, including quality control and
troubleshooting, following this SOP. The laboratory supervisor or
designated authority is responsible for ensuring adherence to this
protocol, addressing any non-conformities, and updating the SOP as
necessary.
4. INTRODUCTION
Homocysteine is an amino acid in the blood that can reflect an
individual's risk of cardiovascular disease. Accurate measurement is
essential for patient diagnosis and management.
5. DEFINITIONS
• Homocysteine: An amino acid involved in methionine
metabolism.
• CLIA: Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments that regulate
laboratory testing.
• LIS: Laboratory Information System for processing and storing
test results.
6. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Plasma samples collected in EDTA tubes.
• Analytical instrument (e.g., HPLC, Immunoassay Analyzer).
• Homocysteine assay kit compatible with the analytical instrument.
• Quality control materials (high and low control levels).
• Calibrators.
• Pipettes and tips.
• Gloves and personal protective equipment (PPE).
• Timer.
• Centrifuge (if plasma separation is necessary).
7. PROCEDURE
7.1. Preparation
1. Sample Handling:
◦ Ensure specimen tubes are correctly labeled and that
plasma samples have been separated from whole blood by
centrifugation at room temperature.
◦ Verify the specimen integrity. Reject any samples that are
hemolyzed or improperly labeled.
2. Reagent Preparation:
◦ Prepare reagents according to the manufacturer's
instructions provided in the assay kit.
◦ Equilibrate reagents and calibrators to room temperature
before use, if required.
3. Calibration:
◦ Perform instrument calibration using provided calibrators
before running patient samples. Calibrate the instrument
according to the manufacturer's instructions.
◦ Document results of calibration and ensure they fall within
the acceptable range.
7.2. Sample Analysis
1. Loading Samples:
◦ Load calibration standards, quality control samples, and
patient plasma samples into the instrument as per the
specified order.
◦ Ensure the instrument is set to measure Homocysteine,
Total, Plasma.
2. Running the Assay:
◦ Start the assay run on the instrument following the
instructions provided in the manufacturer's manual.
◦ Monitor the run for any errors or warnings.
3. Quality Control:
◦ Run quality control samples at the beginning of each shift,
after recalibration, or whenever new reagents are used.
◦ Assess the QC results against established criteria provided
by the assay manufacturer.
◦ Document all QC results in the QC log. Accept the QC run if
there is no shift, trend, or out-of-control error.
4. Results Documentation:
◦ Evaluate patient sample results only if calibration and quality
control measurements are within acceptable limits.
◦ Document results in the Laboratory Information System
(LIS) and review for integrity. Validate results by ensuring
they match the expected value ranges.
8. TROUBLESHOOTING
1. Calibration Failure:
◦ Review calibration procedures to ensure they were correctly
followed. Recalibrate if necessary.
◦ If recalibration fails, contact the instrument vendor or
technical support.
2. Quality Control Failure:
◦ Re-run any quality control samples that fail to meet
expected ranges.
◦ Assess potential causes of failure, such as expired reagents
or instrument malfunctions.
◦ Document all remedial actions taken.
3. Instrument Errors:
◦ Consult the instrument manual to resolve errors indicated
during assay runs.
◦ If a mechanical or software issue persists, escalate to the
designated supervisor or technical support.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Result Review:
◦ Verify results for accuracy and completeness before
reporting.
◦ Any critical results must be communicated urgently to the
designated clinical staff according to the laboratory's critical
value policy.
2. Documentation:
◦ Ensure that all data, including calibration, QC, and patient
results, are appropriately recorded.
◦ Maintain a file for all assay runs for audit and verification
purposes.
10. QUALITY CONTROL
Refer to the laboratory's general Quality Control SOP for inter-lab
and intra-lab QC procedures. Implement bi-weekly and monthly QC
checks using control materials to ensure ongoing assay accuracy.
11. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS
• Follow all safety guidelines for handling blood specimens and
reagents.
• Wear appropriate PPE and follow biosafety precautions.
• Dispose of biohazardous waste in accordance with institutional
policies and regulatory requirements.

13. REVIEW AND DOCUMENTATION
The supervisor will review the SOP annually or whenever there is a
change in the test methodology, reagents, or equipment. All updates
to the SOP must be appropriately documented and disseminated to
all trained personnel.
