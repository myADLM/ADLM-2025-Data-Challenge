Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Homocysteine, Total, Serum
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedures for the analysis
of homocysteine levels in serum samples. Accurate and reliable
results are crucial for the diagnosis and monitoring of various health
conditions, such as cardiovascular diseases and deficiencies in
vitamin B12, B6, and folate.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
All laboratory personnel performing this test are responsible for
adhering to this SOP to ensure the accuracy and reliability of test
results. It is also the responsibility of the lab supervisor to ensure that
all personnel are adequately trained and competent in performing this
procedure.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type:
• Serum
Collection and Handling:
• Collect blood in a plain red-top or serum separator tube (SST).
• Allow the blood to clot at room temperature for 30 to 60 minutes.
• Centrifuge the SST within 2 hours of collection at 3000 rpm for 10
minutes to separate the serum from the clot.
• Transfer the serum to a labeled transport tube.
• Store serum at 2-8°C if analysis will be performed within 24 hours.
For longer storage, freeze serum aliquots at -20°C or lower. Avoid
repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Grossly hemolyzed specimens.
• Specimens exposed to repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
• Specimens without proper labeling or that are collected in
inappropriate tubes.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
Equipment:
• Centrifuge
• Refrigerator (2-8°C)
• Freezer (-20°C or lower)
• Calibrated pipettes and tips
• Automated or manual immunoassay analyzer
Reagents:
• Homocysteine assay kits (Ensure reagents are stored as per
manufacturer’s instructions)
• Quality control materials (2 levels: normal and abnormal)
• Calibrators (traceable to an appropriate standard)
1. CALIBRATION AND QUALITY CONTROL
Calibration:
• Perform calibration according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
• Use calibrators traceable to an appropriate standard.
• Calibration must be verified before patient samples are tested.
Recalibrate as needed based on manufacturer recommendations
or if there is a significant shift in quality control results.
Quality Control:
• Run two levels of quality control materials (normal and abnormal)
at the beginning of each day of testing, with each new lot of
reagents, and after each calibration.
• Document all quality control results in the Quality Control Log.
• Acceptable ranges must be established for each control material.
Investigate and resolve any out-of-range quality control results
before testing patient samples.
1. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Allow reagents, calibrators, and controls to come to room
temperature before use.
2. Verify that all equipment is functioning properly and that the
analyzer is calibrated.
Assay Procedure:
1. Pipette the patient serum samples, calibrators, and control
materials into appropriate wells or tubes according to the assay
kit instructions.
2. Add the assay reagents to each well or tube in the specified
order and volumes.
3. Incubate the mixture according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
4. Wash the wells or tubes if required by the specific method.
5. Add the detection reagent and incubate as required.
6. Read the absorbance or fluorescence at the specified
wavelength using the appropriate analyzer.
Result Calculation:
1. Plot the calibration curve using the absorbance or fluorescence
values of the calibrators.
2. Determine the homocysteine concentrations of the patient
samples and controls by interpolating their absorbance or
fluorescence values on the calibration curve.
3. Verify that control results are within the acceptable range before
reporting patient results.
4. REPORTING RESULTS
Reference Intervals:
• Establish site-specific reference intervals based on population
studies or verify intervals provided by the assay kit manufacturer.
Common reference intervals are:
◦ Normal: 5-15 µmol/L
Result Verification:
• Review results for quality control acceptability and consistency.
• Verify that there are no flags or comments indicating potential
issues with the assay.
Documentation:
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Flag any results that fall outside the established reference
intervals.
1. RESULT INTERPRETATION AND LIMITATIONS
Interpretation:
• Elevated homocysteine levels may indicate deficiencies in vitamin
B12, B6, or folate, increased risk of cardiovascular disease, or
other metabolic disorders.
• Results should be interpreted in conjunction with patient history,
clinical examination, and other laboratory findings.
Limitations:
• Hemolyzed or lipemic specimens may affect assay accuracy.
• Certain medications and medical conditions can interfere with
homocysteine levels.
1. RECORD KEEPING
• Maintain a log of calibration curves, quality control results, and
any corrective actions taken.
• Ensure all documentation is complete, accurate, and stored
securely.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If there are any issues with the assay, such as out-of-range quality
control results or equipment malfunctions, refer to the
troubleshooting guide provided by the assay kit manufacturer.
• Document any issues and the steps taken to resolve them.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's instructions and package inserts for the
homocysteine assay kit.
• Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines.
• Relevant peer-reviewed literature on homocysteine testing and
interpretation.
1. APPROVAL AND REVIEW
This SOP must be reviewed annually and approved by the laboratory
director.
