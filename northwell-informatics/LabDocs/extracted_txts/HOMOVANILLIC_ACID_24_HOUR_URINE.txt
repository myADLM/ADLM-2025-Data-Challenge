Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Generating Results for
HOMOVANILLIC ACID, 24 HOUR, URINE
1. PURPOSE
To ensure accurate and timely measurement of Homovanillic Acid
(HVA) in 24-hour urine specimens. This assay is critical for
diagnosing and monitoring patients with disorders affecting
catecholamine metabolism, including neuroblastoma and other
pediatric cancers.
2. SPECIMEN
A. Collection Requirements:
• Specimen Type: 24-hour urine collection
• Collection Container: Clean, plastic container provided by the
laboratory
• Preservative: Include 10 mL of 6N HCl or as specified by the
laboratory
• Instructions: Patients must be instructed to collect all urine voided
in a 24-hour period. The specimen must be kept refrigerated or in
a cool place during the collection period. Document starting and
ending times.
B. Specimen Transport and Storage:
• Transport: Specimen must be transported to the laboratory as
soon as possible after the collection is completed.
• Storage Conditions: Refrigerated (2-8°C) if not immediately
processed.
C. Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens without preservative
• Specimens not kept refrigerated during the collection period
• Specimens not correctly labeled with collection start and end time
• Specimens contaminated with feces or other foreign materials
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Homovanillic Acid (HVA) assay kit (manufacturer as specified)
• Calibrated pipettes and volumetric flasks
• Centrifuge
• Automated analyzer or HPLC system
• pH meter
• Refrigerator (2-8°C)
• Biohazard disposal equipment
• Temperature and humidity monitoring devices
4. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation of Specimen:
1. Ensure the collection container is properly labeled with the
patient's name, collection period, and preservative details.
2. Measure and record the total volume of the 24-hour urine
specimen.
3. Mix the specimen thoroughly to ensure homogeneity.
4. Aliquote a portion of the specimen (typically 25-50 mL) for HVA
testing.
B. Assay Procedure:
1. Follow manufacturer instructions for the preparation and
calibration of the HVA assay kit/analyzer.
2. Transfer the aliquoted urine specimen to a properly labeled
aliquot tube.
3. Adjust the pH of the aliquoted specimen if required by the
assay protocol.
4. Load the aliquot onto the automated analyzer or prepare for
HPLC analysis according to manufacturer guidelines.
5. Perform the assay for HVA following the specific protocols:
a. For automated analyzers:
◦ Ensure the instrument is calibrated and quality control
checks are within acceptable ranges.
◦ Run the aliquot through the analyzer and record results.
b. For HPLC systems:
◦ Ensure HPLC system setup, including column and mobile
phase preparation.
◦ Inject the aliquot and record chromatographic data.
◦ Analyze the collected data and determine HVA
concentration.
C. Troubleshooting:
Any deviations or unexpected results require troubleshooting steps:
• Verify specimen and reagent volumes.
• Check calibration and maintenance logs for analyzers.
• Re-run controls and specimens as necessary.
• Notify supervisor for assistance with unresolved issues.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
A. Internal Quality Control:
• Run two levels of quality control (QC) material during each batch
(Negative and Positive controls).
• Ensure QC results fall within acceptable ranges as defined by the
manufacturer.
• Document QC results and any corrective actions taken for out-of-
range controls.
B. External Quality Control:
• Participate in external proficiency testing programs.
• Follow any additional QC procedures specific to HVA assay
protocols.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
A. Reviewing and Verifying Results:
• Technologist must review all results and ensure they are within
reportable range.
• Verify results against QC material results before reporting.
• Report results following site-specific guidelines and LIS
requirements.
B. Critical Values:
Any critical values or results suggestive of significant medical issues
should be communicated to the ordering physician immediately
following laboratory policy.
7. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to manufacturer’s kit information for all method limitations.
• Document any interference or limitations observed during
specimen analysis.

updated on any procedural changes or updates based on current
best practices as of October 2023.
