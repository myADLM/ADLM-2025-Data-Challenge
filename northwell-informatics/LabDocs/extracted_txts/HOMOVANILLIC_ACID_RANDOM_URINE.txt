Protocol for the Analytical Phase of Generating Results for
Homovanillic Acid, Random, Urine
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this protocol is to provide detailed instructions for the
analysis of Homovanillic Acid (HVA) in random urine samples.
Homovanillic acid is a major catecholamine metabolite and its levels
are essential for diagnosing and monitoring neuroendocrine tumors
and neuroblastoma.
1. SPECIMEN
Preferred/acceptable:
• 10 mL of random urine collected in a clean, plastic container
without preservatives.
Unacceptable:
• Specimens collected in containers with preservatives.
• Specimens arriving at the laboratory more than 24 hours after
collection without refrigeration.
• Specimens with visible debris, blood, or other contaminants.
Handling:
• Specimens should be refrigerated at 2-8°C upon collection and
must remain refrigerated during transport.
1. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• HPLC-grade water, acetonitrile
• Homovanillic Acid reference standard
• Internal standards (e.g., isotopically labeled HVA)
• HPLC system with fluorescence or electrochemical detection
capabilities
• Mobile phase components (buffers, solvents, etc.)
• Sample preparation supplies (e.g., solid-phase extraction
cartridges, centrifuge)
• Calibrators and quality control materials
1. EQUIPMENT
• High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system
• Centrifuge capable of reaching 3000g
• Analytical balance
• Freezer for storing reagents and specimens
1. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Preparation:
• Aliquot 10mL of the random urine sample into a clean tube.
• Centrifuge the sample at 3000g for 10 minutes to remove
particulates.
• Transfer the supernatant to a new clean tube.
B. Calibration and Quality Control Preparation:
• Prepare calibrators and quality control samples by diluting the
HVA reference standard in the same matrix as the urine sample.
• Calibrators and controls should cover the expected range of
results (e.g., 0-100 mg/L).
C. Sample Extraction:
• Condition the solid-phase extraction (SPE) cartridge with
appropriate solvents (e.g., methanol, followed by water).
• Load a specified volume (e.g., 1mL) of the urine supernatant onto
the SPE cartridge.
• Elute HVA from the SPE cartridge using an appropriate solvent
(e.g., methanol).
• Dry the eluent under nitrogen and reconstitute in the mobile
phase.
D. Instrument Calibration:
• Inject the calibrators into the HPLC system to establish a
calibration curve.
• Ensure that the calibration curve is linear and covers the expected
concentration range.
E. Sample Analysis:
• Inject the prepared urine sample into the HPLC system.
• Use internal standards to correct for any potential losses during
preparation.
• Monitor and record the detector response for HVA.
F. Data Analysis:
• Compare the detector response of the urine samples against the
calibration curve to determine the HVA concentration.
• Ensure that the internal standards’ responses are within
acceptable limits.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run quality control samples at the beginning and end of each
batch of specimens analyzed.
• Ensure that quality control results fall within predetermined
acceptable ranges.
• If QC samples do not meet criteria, troubleshoot and resolve
issues before reporting results.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Verify all results against instrument calibration and QC data.
• Any results significantly outside the reference range should be
flagged for review and follow-up action.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Typical reference intervals for HVA in urine should be confirmed
based on population-specific data. Example: <15 mg/L for random
urine.
1. LIMITATIONS
• HVA levels can be affected by dietary intake and medications; it is
essential to consider these factors when interpreting results.
• Ensure that the samples are free from contamination as it could
impact the accuracy of the results.
1. REFERENCES
• Relevant clinical and laboratory guidelines for HPLC analysis of
catecholamine metabolites.
• HPLC system operation and maintenance manuals.
• Studies and literature on HVA analysis in urine.
1. DOCUMENTATION
All procedures, including calibration and quality control data,
specimen analysis records, and instrument maintenance logs, should
be documented comprehensively. They must be accessible for
reviewing and auditing according to laboratory standards and
regulations.
