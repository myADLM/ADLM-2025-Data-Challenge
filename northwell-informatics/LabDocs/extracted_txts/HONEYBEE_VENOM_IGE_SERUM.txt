Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Honeybee Venom, IgE,
Serum Testing
1. PURPOSE
To detail the procedures for the analytical phase of testing serum
samples for Honeybee Venom IgE (Immunoglobulin E) antibodies.
This SOP ensures consistent, accurate, and reliable results, in
accordance with CLIA guidelines.
Responsibility:
Trained laboratory technologists are responsible for performing and
documenting all steps outlined in this SOP.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen Type:
• Serum
Specimen Collection:
• Blood should be collected via venipuncture into a red-top or
serum separator tube (SST).
Specimen Handling:
• Allow the blood to clot for 30 minutes at room temperature, then
centrifuge at 1000-1300 RCF for 10-15 minutes.
• Transfer the serum into a labeled aliquot tube.
• Store serum samples at 2-8°C if testing will be performed within
48 hours, or freeze at -20°C or lower for longer storage.
Specimen Stability:
• Room Temperature: 8 hours
• Refrigerated: 48 hours
• Frozen: 6 months
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples
• Specimens not labeled properly
• Specimens not stored or handled correctly
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• ELISA (Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay) Plate Reader
• Micropipettes and Tips
• Vortex Mixer
• Incubator (37°C)
• Honeybee Venom IgE ELISA Kit (commercially prepared)
• Distilled Water
• Plate Washing Buffer
• Substrate Solution
• Stop Solution
• Positive and Negative Controls (as provided in the ELISA kit)
4. QUALITY CONTROL
Internal Quality Control:
• Perform calibration and validation of laboratory equipment as per
manufacturer guidelines.
• Run positive and negative controls with each assay to ensure the
accuracy and reliability of test results.
• Document all quality control runs in the QC log with date, time,
and initials.
5. PROCEDURE
A. Pre-Analytical Phase:
• Verify that the serum specimen is correctly labeled and stored.
• Equilibrate samples, controls, and reagents to room temperature
before starting the assay.
B. Analytical Phase:
1. Preparation of Reagents:
• Prepare washing buffer, substrate solution, and any other
reagents as per the ELISA kit manufacturer's instructions.
2. Plate Setup:
• Arrange the microplate based on the ELISA kit layout. Ensure
there are blank wells, standard control wells, and patient sample
wells.
• Add 100 µL of each standard, control, and diluted serum sample
into the appropriate wells.
3. Incubation:
• Incubate the plate for a specified time (usually 1-2 hours) at room
temperature to allow binding.
4. Washing:
• Wash the plate multiple times with washing buffer to remove
unbound substances.
5. Addition of Detection Antibody:
• Add 100 µL of detection antibody to each well. Incubate as per kit
instructions.
6. Second Washing:
• Perform additional washes to ensure thorough removal of
unbound antibody.
7. Substrate Addition:
• Add 100 µL of substrate solution to each well.
• Incubate the plate in the dark as per the recommended time
(typically 15-30 minutes).
8. Stop Reaction:
• Add 50-100 µL of stop solution to each well when the color
change is sufficient.
9. Reading Results:
• Read the optical density (OD) at 450 nm using the ELISA plate
reader.
• Calculate the concentration of Honeybee Venom IgE in each
sample by comparing the ODs to the standard curve.
10. Result Interpretation:
• Express results in kU/L as per kit instructions.
• Document analysis results, ensuring to include all software and
manual calculations involved.
C. Post-Analytical Phase:
1. Reporting Results:
• Review and verify results obtained from the ELISA plate reader.
• Report results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
following standard reporting guidelines.
2. Critical Results:
• If critical values are identified, communicate results immediately
to the requesting physician as per laboratory policy.
3. Sample Integrity:
• Assess the sample's integrity. If there are any concerns about the
sample integrity or initial results, document the issue, request a
new sample, if required, and re-run the analysis.
6. REPORTING RESULTS:
• Ensure all patient identifiers, results, and other pertinent
information are documented correctly in the LIS.
• Results should be reviewed and verified by a laboratory
technologist before release.
7. REFERENCE INTERVALS AND METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Reference Intervals: Consult the kit insert or latest compatibility
data for specific reference ranges.
• Method Limitations: Refer to the ELISA kit insert for any specific
testing limitations, interferences, or cross-reactivity concerns.

• Laboratory Quality Assurance Procedures Manual
9. MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS
• Keep all records of sample reception, quality control data, testing
procedures, and result reporting in compliance with the
laboratory’s documentation and retention policy.
10. SAFETY AND BIOSAFETY
• Follow all standard biosafety guidelines when handling human
serum samples, and always use appropriate Personal Protective
Equipment (PPE). Dispose of all biohazard waste according to
regulatory guidelines.
By adhering to this SOP, laboratory technologists will ensure
standardized processing and accurate analysis of Honeybee Venom
IgE in serum samples.
