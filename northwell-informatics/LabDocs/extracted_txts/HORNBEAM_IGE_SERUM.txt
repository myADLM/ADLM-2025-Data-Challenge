Standard Operating Procedure
(SOP)
Analytical Phase for Generating
HORNBEAM IgE (SERUM) Results
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedures for the analysis and reporting of Hornbeam
specific IgE levels in serum samples received in the laboratory.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel trained and authorized
to perform Hornbeam IgE (Serum) testing.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Authorized laboratory technologists are responsible for following
this SOP.
• Supervisors are responsible for overseeing the process and
ensuring compliance.
• It is the responsibility of all staff to identify any issues in the
testing process that may affect results and to report them to a
supervisor.
4. MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT
• Serum samples
• Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) kit for Hornbeam
IgE
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Microplate reader with appropriate filters
• Microplate washer
• Incubator set to 37°C
• Calibrated timers
• Reagent reservoirs
• Disposable gloves and lab coats
5. PROCEDURE
5.1 PREPARATION
1. Reagent Preparation: Prepare all reagents, standards, and
controls according to the ELISA kit manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Equipment Calibration: Ensure that the microplate reader and
washer are calibrated as per the manufacturer’s guidelines.
5.2 SAMPLE HANDLING
1. Specimen Requirements: Use serum collected in an SST
(serum separator tube). Allow blood to coagulate at room
temperature and then centrifuge for separation.
2. Specimen Storage: Store serum samples at 2-8°C if assayed
within 48 hours or at -20°C for longer storage.
5.3 ASSAY PROCEDURE
1. Sample Addition:
◦ Pipette standards, controls, and serum samples into the
appropriate wells of the ELISA plate. Ensure that duplicate
wells are used.
2. Incubation:
◦ Incubate the plate for the specified time at 37°C as per the
kit instructions.
3. Washing:
◦ Aspirate the contents of the wells and wash them using the
microplate washer according to the ELISA kit instructions.
4. Secondary Antibody Addition:
◦ Add the enzyme-labeled secondary antibody to each well.
Incubate for the time specified in the ELISA kit instructions,
and wash as directed.
5. Substrate Addition:
◦ Add the substrate solution to each well. Incubate for the
specified time in the dark to allow the color reaction to
develop.
6. Stop Reaction:
◦ Add the stop solution to each well according to the kit's
instructions to halt the color reaction.
7. Reading:
◦ Read the optical density of each well using the microplate
reader at the wavelength specified in the ELISA kit
instructions.
5.4 DATA ANALYSIS
1. Calculation:
◦ Generate a standard curve from the standards run in the
assay. Calculate the concentration of Hornbeam IgE in the
serum samples by comparing their optical density values to
the standard curve.
2. Quality Control:
◦ Ensure that all controls are within the expected ranges. If
controls fall outside of acceptable limits, reject the run and
repeat the assay.
3. Result Reporting:
◦ Record the results in the Laboratory Information System
(LIS). Verify all results before final reporting.
6. QUALITY CONTROL AND SAFETY
• Quality Control:
◦ Perform routine quality control assessments using known
standards and controls.
◦ Document all quality control activities.
• Safety:
◦ Wear personal protective equipment (PPE) including gloves
and lab coats.
◦ Handle all biological samples as potentially infectious.
◦ Follow all biosafety and waste disposal protocols.
