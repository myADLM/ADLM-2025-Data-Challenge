Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Analytical Phase for
Generating Results for HORSEFLY/STABLEFLY, IGE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
To provide a detailed procedure for the analysis of HORSEFLY/
STABLEFLY, IGE in serum samples, ensuring accurate and reliable
results.
1. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel involved in the
processing and analysis of serum for HORSEFLY/STABLEFLY, IGE
within the clinical laboratory.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all designated laboratory personnel to follow
this SOP to ensure the integrity and accuracy of the test results. All
staff members must be properly trained and competent in performing
these analyses.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
4.1. Specimen Collection - Specimen Type: Serum - Minimum
Volume: 1 mL - Collection Container: SST (Serum Separator Tube) or
red-top tube - Specimens must be adequately labeled with patient
identification and collection date/time.
4.2. Specimen Handling and Storage - After blood collection, allow
the specimen to clot at room temperature (20–25°C) for 30–60
minutes. - Centrifuge the specimen at 1500-2000 x g for 10 minutes.
- Transfer the serum to a labeled aliquot tube. - Specimens should be
stored at 2–8°C if analysis is to be performed within 72 hours. For
long-term storage, freeze at -20°C or colder.
4.3. Unacceptable Specimens - Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric
specimens. - Specimens received in unapproved containers or those
arriving beyond stability limits.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
5.1 Equipment - Centrifuge - Pipettes and disposable tips -
Immunoassay analyzer (e.g., ImmunoCAP 100, 250, 1000) -
Refrigerator and freezer
5.2 Reagents - HORSEFLY/STABLEFLY, IGE reagent kit - Store at
2–8°C, and do not use past the expiration date.
5.3 Supplies - SST or red-top collection tubes - Aliquot tubes -
Calibration controls - Quality control materials
1. PROCEDURE
6.1 Calibration - Perform calibration according to the manufacturer’s
instructions using certified calibration materials. - Document
calibration results and the date performed on the Calibration Log. -
Ensure that calibration passes all acceptance criteria before
proceeding with patient tests.
6.2 Quality Control - Run quality control (QC) samples at the
beginning of each testing day and with each new reagent lot. - Use
two levels of QC material (low and high). - Document QC results, and
ensure they fall within the established range. If QC results are
outside the acceptable limits, troubleshoot, and resolve any issues
before proceeding with patient samples.
6.3 Sample Analysis - Allow serum samples to reach room
temperature prior to analysis. - Load patient samples, calibrators, and
QC materials onto the immunoassay analyzer following the
instrument's operational manual. - Select the appropriate method for
HORSEFLY/STABLEFLY, IGE analysis. - Initiate the assay run. -
Once the run is complete, review the results for each sample.
6.4 Result Verification - Verify the results against control and
calibration data. - Any flagged results or those falling outside
expected ranges must be repeated or further investigated. -
Document any reruns or discrepancies in the Result Verification Log.
6.5 Reporting Results - Record the final validated results in the
Laboratory Information System (LIS). - Ensure that all results are
reviewed and verified by a qualified technologist before releasing
them.
1. RECORD KEEPING
◦ Maintain all logs, including Calibration, QC, and Result
Verification Logs in accordance with the laboratory’s
document retention policy.
