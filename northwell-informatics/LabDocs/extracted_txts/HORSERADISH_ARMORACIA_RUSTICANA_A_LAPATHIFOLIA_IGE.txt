Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Horseradish (Armoracia rusticana/A.
lapathifolia) IgE
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to provide detailed instructions for the
analytical phase of generating results for Horseradish (Armoracia
rusticana/A.lapathifolia) IgE specific antibodies using established
immunoassay techniques. This protocol ensures adherence to quality
standards and reliability of test results.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory staff, including medical laboratory scientists
and technologists, are responsible for performing the test procedures
and generating results for Horseradish IgE as outlined in this SOP.
Supervisors are responsible for ensuring adherence to this protocol
and for handling quality control and troubleshooting steps.
2. PROCEDURE
The analytical phase includes all steps from setting up the
immunoassay to result generation, ensuring accuracy, precision, and
compliance with quality control standards.
2.1 EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Automated Immunoassay Analyzers (e.g., Phadia ImmunoCAP
system)
• Microplate reader, if using ELISA
• Horseradish IgE specific reagent kits
• Calibrators and controls
• Disposable pipette tips
• Micropipettes
• Gloves and lab coat
• Laboratory Information System (LIS)
2.2 SAMPLE HANDLING
• Ensure that the sample (serum or plasma) has been appropriately
collected, received, and accessioned.
• Confirm sample integrity and suitability for analysis.
• If the sample has been stored, thaw and mix gently before
analysis.
2.3 CALIBRATION AND QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform calibration of the immunoassay analyzer according to the
manufacturer's instructions using provided calibrators.
• Run controls with each batch of samples, including both low and
high positive controls. Ensure controls fall within established
ranges before proceeding with sample analysis.
2.4 TEST PROCEDURE
1. Preparation:
◦ Power on the immunoassay analyzer and perform
necessary startup checks.
◦ Prepare the reagents, calibrators, and controls as specified
in the reagent kit instructions.
2. Sample Loading:
◦ Pipette the required volume of calibrators, controls, and
patient samples into designated wells of the microplate or
into individual sample cups for automated analyzers.
◦ Secure the plate or sample cups in the analyzer.
3. Assay Execution:
◦ Start the assay run according to the analyzer's instructions.
◦ For automated systems, ensure the analyzer is set to test
for Horseradish IgE specific antibodies.
4. Incubation:
◦ Allow appropriate incubation times as specified by the
reagent kit protocol to ensure binding of IgE antibodies to
horseradish antigen.
5. Washing and Detection:
◦ Follow the washing steps to remove unbound substances.
◦ Add enzyme-labeled anti-IgE detection antibody and
incubate as directed.
◦ Perform final washing steps and add the substrate solution.
6. Reading Results:
◦ Incubate for the specified time to allow the color reaction to
develop.
◦ Measure the absorbance/read the signal at the specific
wavelength indicated in the kit insert using the microplate
reader or immunoassay analyzer.
2.5 QUALITY CONTROL REVIEW
• Confirm that all control results are within the predefined
acceptable range.
• Investigate and resolve any out-of-range control results before
validating patient results.
2.6 RESULT VALIDATION AND REPORTING
• Review all patient results for consistency and plausibility.
• Validate results through the LIS, ensuring results are correctly
entered and reported.
• Include reference intervals and any necessary interpretive
comments in the final report.
3. POST ANALYSIS
3.1 DOCUMENTATION
• Ensure all quality control, calibration, and patient result records
are accurately documented.
• Maintain logs for equipment checks, reagents used, and any
troubleshooting performed.
3.2 TROUBLESHOOTING
• If any issues arise during the assay, follow troubleshooting steps
as indicated in the reagent kit instructions or analyzer user
manual.
• Document any deviations or corrective actions taken in the
appropriate log.
4. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions for the specific Horseradish IgE
reagent kit.
• Immunoassay Analyzer User Manual (e.g., Phadia ImmunoCAP,
ELISA reader).
5. REVISION HISTORY
• Document any changes to this SOP with the date of revision and
a brief description of the update.
