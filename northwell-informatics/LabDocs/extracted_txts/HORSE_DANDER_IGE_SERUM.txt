Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
HORSE DANDER, IGE, SERUM
1. Purpose
To outline the procedure for performing Horse Dander IgE analysis in
serum samples using the designated immunoassay method to
provide accurate, reproducible, and timely results.
2. Scope
This SOP applies to all trained laboratory personnel responsible for
performing Horse Dander IgE analysis in serum samples.
3. Responsibility
• Qualified laboratory scientists are responsible for performing and
documenting the analysis as per this SOP.
• The supervisor or designated personnel must ensure compliance
with this SOP and address any deviations or issues that arise
during the analytical process.
4. Definitions
IgE (Immunoglobulin E): An antibody type associated with allergic
responses.
Horse Dander: Allergens derived from horse skin and hair.
5. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies
• Immunoassay analyzer (e.g., ImmunoCAP, ELISA system)
• Standards and calibrators specific to Horse Dander IgE
• Quality control materials (positive and negative controls)
• Sample diluent
• Pipettes (calibrated)
• Centrifuge
• Serum separator tubes (SST)
• Incubator (if required by assay method)
• Laboratory logbook or LIMS system for documentation
6. Procedure
6.1. Pre-Analytical Checks
• Ensure all equipment is calibrated and properly maintained.
• Verify that reagents and controls are within their expiry dates and
stored as recommended by the manufacturer.
• Confirm that the sample identification is correct and matches the
laboratory requisition.
6.2. Sample Preparation
• Collect serum samples in SST and centrifuge as per standard
procedures.
◦ Centrifuge at approximately 1500-2000 x g for 10 minutes.
◦ Ensure serum is free of hemolysis, lipemia, or icterus.
• Transfer aliquots of serum to labeled tubes for analysis, avoiding
hemolytic and lipemic samples.
6.3. Assay Procedure
1. Calibration and Quality Control:
◦ Run calibrators and controls according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
◦ Assess control results to ensure they fall within the
predefined acceptable range.
2. Sample Analysis:
◦ Load patient samples onto the immunoassay analyzer along
with standards, calibrators, and controls.
◦ Follow the specific instructions for the immunoassay method
used (refer to the instrument manual).
◦ Ensure the analyzer is set to detect Horse Dander IgE.
3. Incubation and Reaction:
◦ Allow samples to incubate with reagents as per the
manufacturer's specifications.
◦ Ensure proper timing and temperature conditions are
followed.
4. Detection and Measurement:
◦ Measure the fluorescence, chemiluminescence, or
absorbance (as per the method) to quantify Horse Dander
IgE levels.
◦ Verify that the analyzer's results meet defined quality
criteria.
5. Result Documentation:
◦ Record results in the laboratory logbook or LIMS.
◦ Review and validate results against controls and calibrators.
◦ Address any flagged or questionable results by re-assaying
or investigating further as necessary.
6.4. Post-Analytical Procedures
• Validate and verify test results according to laboratory guidelines.
• Document any deviations, corrective actions, or noteworthy
observations.
• Report results to the ordering clinician through the laboratory
information system (LIS).
6. Reporting Results
• Ensure results are reviewed and verified before reporting to LIS.
• Report critical results immediately to the clinician as per
laboratory policy.
• Reference ranges: As per laboratory standard or specific kit
insert.
7. Quality Control
• Perform QC evaluation with every new batch of reagents and
daily prior to running patient samples.
• Document and review QC results regularly, addressing any out-of-
range findings by troubleshooting or recalibrating equipment.
8. References
• Manufacturer's instructions for the immunoassay system used.
• Relevant laboratory standard operating procedures for sample
handling and safety.
• Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines.
