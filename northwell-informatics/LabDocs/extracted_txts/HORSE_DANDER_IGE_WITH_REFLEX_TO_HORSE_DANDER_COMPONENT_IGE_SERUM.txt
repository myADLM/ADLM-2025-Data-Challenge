Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Testing of
HORSE DANDER, IGE WITH REFLEX TO HORSE DANDER
COMPONENT, IGE, SERUM
1. Purpose: To outline the step-by-step procedure for the analysis of
HORSE DANDER, IGE WITH REFLEX TO HORSE DANDER
COMPONENT, IGE, in serum, ensuring test reliability, accuracy, and
appropriate QC is achieved.
2. Scope: This SOP applies to the analytical process of HORSE
DANDER, IGE testing with reflex to HORSE DANDER
COMPONENT, IGE testing conducted in the laboratory for serum
samples.
3. Responsibilities:
• Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the test
as per protocol.
• Laboratory supervisors are responsible for ensuring the
adherence to SOP and validation of test results.
4. Definitions:
• HORSE DANDER, IGE: Immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies
specific to allergens in horse dander.
• HORSE DANDER COMPONENT, IGE: Specific IgE antibodies to
individual protein components derived from horse dander.
5. Specimen:
• Preferred: Serum sample (red top or SST tube, minimum volume:
1 mL)
• Unacceptable: Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
6. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies:
• Immunoassay analyzer (e.g., Phadia 250/5000 or similar)
• HORSE DANDER, IGE reagents and controls
• HORSE DANDER COMPONENT, IGE reagents (for reflex testing)
• Micropipettes and tips
• Calibrated centrifuge
• Control and calibration standards for IgE
• Sample tubes and necessary accessories
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
7. Procedure: A) Preliminary Steps:
• Verify the calibration and maintenance of the immunoassay
analyzer.
• Confirm the availability and integrity of the necessary reagents
and controls.
• Prepare the workstation with proper PPE.
B) Sample Preparation:
• Centrifuge the serum tubes at 2000 x g for 10 minutes to separate
serum and remove any particulates.
• Aliquot serum into labeled sample cups if necessary, avoiding
transfer of any debris.
C) Loading Samples:
• Place calibration standards, controls, and patient samples onto
the immunoassay analyzer as per manufacturer's instructions.
• Program the analyzer to perform the HORSE DANDER, IGE
assay—input relevant patient and sample identification into the
system.
D) Performing the Assay:
• Following system prompts, initiate the assay run.
• HORSE DANDER, IGE levels are quantified using fluorescence
or chemiluminescence technology based on the specific assay
kinetics.
• Quality Control verification: Ensure control values fall within the
established range before accepting results.
E) Reflex Testing to HORSE DANDER COMPONENT, IGE (if
applicable):
• If HORSE DANDER, IGE is above the set threshold (e.g., 0.35
kU/L or as specified), initiate testing for HORSE DANDER
COMPONENT, IGE using the predefined component panel.
• Load and run the supplemental component assays as required by
the analyzer instructions.
8. Reporting Results:
• Verify and review the analyzer outputs for both HORSE DANDER,
IGE and, if applicable, HORSE DANDER COMPONENT, IGE.
• Document all results and QC data in the Laboratory Information
System (LIS) following laboratory reporting guidelines.
• Results outside reference ranges, and critical values require
expedited review and potential physician notification.
9. Quality Control and Calibration:
• Perform routine QC checks with each assay run using low,
medium, and high control levels.
• Calibrate the immunoassay analyzer at pre-defined intervals and
document in accordance with manufacturer's specifications.
• Bi-weekly inter-laboratory comparisons or proficiency testing to
ensure accuracy.
10. Reference Intervals:
• HORSE DANDER, IGE: Negative <0.35 kU/L; Low: 0.35-0.70 kU/
L; Moderate: 0.70-3.50 kU/L; High: >3.50 kU/L
• HORSE DANDER COMPONENT, IGE: Refer to specific
component documentation for reference values.
11. Method Limitations:
• Cross-reactivity with other proteins could pose interpretation
challenges.
• Improper sample handling or storage could affect antibody
stability and result accuracy.
12. Documentation and References:
• Maintain logs for daily operation, QC, calibration, and
maintenance of the analyzer.
• IVD product inserts and technical manuals (e.g., Phadia 250/5000
ImmunoCAP) for detailed methodology.
13. Review and Revision:
• SOP to be reviewed annually or when procedural updates are
made.
• Approval and amendments documented by laboratory manager.
This SOP ensures a consistent and thorough approach to analyzing
HORSE DANDER, IGE WITH REFLEX TO HORSE DANDER
COMPONENT, IGE, preserving sample integrity and ensuring
accurate, reliable patient results.
