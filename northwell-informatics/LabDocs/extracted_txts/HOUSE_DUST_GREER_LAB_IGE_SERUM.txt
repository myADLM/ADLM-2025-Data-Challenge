Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for HOUSE DUST/GREER LAB, IGE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE To provide detailed instructions for the analysis of
House Dust/Greer Lab, IgE in serum samples. This protocol
ensures standardization and accuracy in the measurement of
IgE levels to diagnose allergic reactions to house dust.
2. SCOPE This protocol applies to all laboratory personnel
involved in the analysis of IgE levels in serum samples
collected for House Dust/Greer Lab allergy testing.
3. RESPONSIBILITY All laboratory personnel must adhere to this
SOP to ensure analytical quality and consistency. Supervisors
are responsible for reviewing accuracy and compliance with the
procedures and documenting any errors and corrective actions
taken.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY Specimen
Type: Serum
• Preferred: Serum samples collected in SST (serum separator
tube).
• Volume: Minimum 1 mL of serum.
• Stability: Refrigerate at 2-8°C for up to 7 days. Freeze at -20°C if
stored longer than 7 days.
• Unacceptable Specimens:
◦ Specimens collected in EDTA, heparin, or citrate tubes.
◦ Specimens that are hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric.
◦ Specimens with insufficient volume.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES Equipment:
• Immunoassay analyzer (e.g., Phadia ImmunoCAP, or equivalent)
• Micropipettes and tips
• Centrifuge
Reagents:
• Allergen-specific IgE assay reagents
• Calibrators and controls specific to the IgE assay
• Deionized water
Supplies:
• Serum separator tubes (SST)
• Sample cups
• Disposable gloves and lab coats
1. PROCEDURE a. Preparation i. Verify that the immunoassay
analyzer is calibrated and performs self-checks. ii. Ensure all
reagents, calibrators, and controls are brought to room
temperature before use. iii. Check the expiration date and lot
number of all reagents and calibrators.
b. Sample Preparation i. Centrifuge the SST at 1000-1300 x g for
10-15 minutes to separate serum. ii. Transfer the serum into a clean
sample cup. iii. Avoid pipetting any cells or lipids from the serum.
c. Assay Procedure (Note: Follow the manufacturer’s instructions
provided with the specific IgE assay kit.) i. Load samples, calibrators,
and controls into the immunoassay analyzer. ii. Select the
appropriate test (House Dust/Greer Lab, IgE) from the control panel.
iii. Ensure assay-specific parameters are set correctly on the
analyzer. iv. Initiate the assay run. v. After the assay is complete,
review the data for acceptance.
d. Post-assay Analysis i. Verify that controls and calibrators fall within
the acceptable ranges. ii. Analyze any flagged or out-of-range results
with recalibration or repeat testing if necessary. iii. Document all QC
results and any re-runs performed.
1. QUALITY CONTROL i. Run controls (positive and negative)
with every batch of tests to ensure assay accuracy and
precision. ii. Document and trend QC results. iii. Take corrective
actions if controls are out of specified ranges, including
troubleshooting the equipment or reagents.
2. REPORTING RESULTS i. Review and verify test results. ii.
Report results according to the laboratory information system
(LIS) protocols. iii. Indicate any abnormal IgE levels that may
require clinical correlation. iv. Include comments regarding
specimen integrity where applicable.
3. METHOD LIMITATIONS Refer to the manufacturer’s insert for
specific limitations related to the assay, including any potential
for cross-reactivity and sensitivity limitations.
4. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's Instructions for Use (IFU) of the IgE assay kit.
• Laboratory-specific guidelines and updates.
1. DOCUMENTATION AND ARCHIVES i. Record all assay and
QC data in the laboratory’s quality control log. ii. Maintain
records of sample analyses, QC results, and corrective actions.
iii. Archive records following the laboratory’s document retention
policy.
