Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Generating Results for
HOUSE DUST/H-S LAB, IGE, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to outline the steps necessary to
perform and report results for Immunoglobulin E (IgE) specific to
house dust allergens in serum samples. This protocol ensures that all
processes are carried out consistently and accurately, adhering to
established quality control standards.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated trained staff are responsible for adhering to this
procedure when processing, analyzing, and reporting results. It is the
duty of all staff to identify any deviations or issues during the process
and report them to the supervisor. Supervisors are responsible for
ensuring compliance with the procedure and taking corrective actions
when necessary.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Serum
• Collection Instructions:
◦ Draw blood using a standard venipuncture technique into a
serum separator tube (SST) or a plain red top tube.
◦ Allow the blood to clot for 30 minutes at room temperature.
◦ Centrifuge the sample at 1500-2000 x g for 10 minutes to
separate the serum.
◦ Transfer the serum to a labeled transport tube if necessary.
• Specimen Stability:
◦ Refrigerated (2-8°C): Stable for up to 7 days.
◦ Frozen (-20°C or lower): Stable for up to 1 year.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Laboratory refrigerator and freezer
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes and tips
• Calibrated analytical balance (if reagent preparation is required)
• IgE assay kits specific for HOUSE DUST allergens
(manufacturers may vary)
◦ Ensure reagents are stored and used according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
• Calibrators, controls, and standards as required by the assay kit
• Disposable gloves and lab coats
• Laboratory timer
• Micropipettes and disposable pipette tips
5. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation
1. Pre-analytical Procedures:
◦ Confirm that the received specimen is acceptable by
ensuring proper labeling and that it meets the collection and
stability requirements.
◦ Reject samples that are grossly hemolyzed, lipemic, or
show obvious signs of contamination.
2. Reagent Preparation:
◦ Prepare all reagents, calibrators, and controls as per the
manufacturer's instructions.
◦ Allow all reagents to come to room temperature before use.
◦ Handle control and calibrator materials with appropriate care
to prevent contamination.
B) Analysis
1. Assay Setup:
◦ Set up the IgE assay according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
◦ Load the samples, controls, and calibrators onto the
designated positions on the analyzer.
2. Running the Assay:
◦ Initiate the assay run as per the instrument’s standard
operating procedures.
◦ Monitor the assay for any instrument error messages or
deviations from expected performance.
◦ Maintain records of assay conditions including lot numbers
of used reagents, date, time, and initials of the operator.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Internal QC:
◦ Run internal quality controls at the start of the assay and with
each new batch of samples.
◦ Use at least two levels of controls (low and high).
◦ Ensure QC results are within the acceptable range as
determined by the manufacturer's guidelines before
proceeding with patient sample analysis.
• External QC:
◦ Participate in an external quality assessment scheme (e.g.,
College of American Pathologists proficiency testing) to
validate accuracy and precision periodically.
• Corrective Action:
◦ If QC results are out of range, do not proceed with patient
testing.
◦ Identify and rectify the cause of the discrepancy, recalibrate
the instrument if necessary, and re-run controls.
◦ Document all corrective actions taken in the laboratory log.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
• Verify and review results against QC data.
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS) for
recording and reporting.
• Flag and document any critical or abnormal values.
• Report results with:
◦ Reference intervals provided by the assay kit manufacturer.
◦ Appropriate interpretative notes if necessary.
• In the case of any anomalies or samples requiring repeat
analysis, document and notify the relevant medical personnel
promptly.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the assay kit manufacturer’s product insert for specific
limitations, which may include:
• Interfering substances that could affect the assay outcome.
• Sensitivity, specificity, and expected diagnostic ranges.
9. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's Product Insert and Technical Bulletins for specific
IgE assay kits.
• Laboratory Quality Assurance Manual.
• Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines.
10. RECORD KEEPING
Maintain all records of test performance, quality controls, instrument
calibration, reagent lot numbers, and any deviations or corrective
actions in accordance with CLIA regulations and laboratory policy.
