Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Title: Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for House Dust Mites/Dermatophagoides
Farinae, IgE, Serum
1. Purpose: To provide a standardized protocol for the analysis of
IgE antibodies specific to Dermatophagoides Farinae (house
dust mites) in serum samples. This procedure ensures accurate
and reliable results for diagnostic and treatment purposes.
2. Scope: This procedure applies to all staff involved in the
analytical phase of testing for Dermatophagoides Farinae-
specific IgE in the laboratory.
3. Responsibilities:
◦ Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing
this procedure and documenting results.
◦ Supervisors are responsible for reviewing results, ensuring
adherence to this protocol, and providing necessary
corrective actions when required.
4. Specimen Requirements:
◦ Specimen Type: Serum.
◦ Collection: Standard venipuncture technique; serum
separator tube (SST) recommended.
◦ Minimum Volume: 1 mL of serum.
◦ Stability: Serum samples must be processed and tested
within 48 hours of collection if stored at 2-8°C. For long-term
storage, freeze sample at -20°C or colder.
5. Equipment and Supplies:
◦ Incubator set at 37°C.
◦ Centrifuge.
◦ Micropipettes and appropriate tips.
◦ ELISA (Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay) kit specific
for Dermatophagoides Farinae IgE detection.
◦ ELISA plate reader.
◦ Temperature controlled refrigerators and freezers (-20°C
and below).
◦ Reagent reservoirs.
◦ Laboratory-specific software for data analysis and reporting.
6. Reagents and Calibrators:
◦ Dermatophagoides Farinae IgE ELISA kit, which includes:
▪ Coated microtiter plates.
▪ Standards or calibrators.
▪ Controls (both positive and negative).
▪ Wash buffer.
▪ Substrate solution.
▪ Stop solution.
▪ Conjugate (enzyme-linked secondary antibody).
◦ Store all reagents according to manufacturer instructions to
ensure stability and performance.
7. Procedure:
◦ Day of Testing:
1. Preparation: a. Bring all reagents and serum samples
to room temperature. b. Prepare wash buffer and other
reagents as per the kit instructions.
2. Sample and Reagent Addition: a. Label the ELISA
plate according to the plate layout, ensuring proper
identification for standards, controls, and serum
samples. b. Add the standards and controls to the
designated wells. c. Dispense the appropriate volume
(usually 50-100 µL) of each serum sample into
separate wells. d. Add the enzyme-linked antibody
conjugate to each well as directed in the kit manual.
3. Incubation: a. Cover the plate with adhesive film or a
plate sealer. b. Incubate the plate at 37°C for the time
specified in the kit manual (typically 1-2 hours).
4. Washing: a. Wash the wells multiple times with
prepared wash buffer to remove unbound substances.
5. Substrate Reaction: a. Add the substrate solution to
each well. b. Incubate the plate at room temperature,
protected from light, for the time specified by the
manufacturer.
6. Stopping the Reaction: a. Add the stop solution to
each well to terminate the enzymatic reaction.
7. Reading and Analysis: a. Read the absorbance of
each well at the recommended wavelength using an
ELISA plate reader. b. Generate a standard curve
using the absorbance values of the standards. c.
Calculate the IgE concentration for Dermatophagoides
Farinae in each serum sample by correlating the
sample absorbance with the standard curve.
8. Quality Control:
◦ Run positive and negative controls with each assay to
validate the test run.
◦ Acceptable control results must fall within the established
range provided by the kit manufacturer.
◦ Implement a troubleshooting protocol if control results are
out of range.
9. Reporting Results:
◦ Document results in the laboratory information system (LIS).
◦ Report IgE concentrations in kU/L (kilo units per liter).
◦ Highlight any critical values as per laboratory guidelines and
inform the relevant healthcare provider promptly.
10. Method Limitations:
◦ Understand and respect the sensitivity, specificity, and
limitations of the ELISA method as outlined in the
manufacturer’s kit insert.
◦ Interferences from lipemia, hemolysis, or microbial
contamination must be considered.
11. References:
◦ Kit manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Current guidelines in allergen-specific IgE testing.
12. Review and Document Control:
◦ This SOP will be annually reviewed and updated as required
to comply with new guidelines and technological
advancements.
