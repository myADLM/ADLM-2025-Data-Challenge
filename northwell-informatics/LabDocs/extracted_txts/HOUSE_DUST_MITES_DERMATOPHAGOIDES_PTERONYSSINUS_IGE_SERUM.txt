Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for House Dust Mites/Dermatophagoides
pteronyssinus, IgE, Serum
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the procedures required for the accurate and
reliable measurement of specific IgE antibodies to House Dust Mites
(Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus) in serum samples using the
ImmunoCAP system. This ensures the provision of valid test results
to support clinical diagnosis of allergies.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of designated laboratory personnel to follow this
SOP and ensure all steps are completed accurately. Supervisors
must ensure that all personnel are trained and proficient in these
procedures.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all serum samples received and tested for
specific IgE antibodies to House Dust Mites (Dermatophagoides
pteronyssinus) in the laboratory.
3. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
• ImmunoCAP 250/1000 system
• ImmunoCAP reagents for House Dust Mites (Dermatophagoides
pteronyssinus)
• Serum samples
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Calibration and control materials
• Sample tubes and racks
• Lab timer
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
4. PROCEDURE
4.1. Preparation
1. Review Samples: Verify the identification and integrity of
serum samples. Ensure that each sample is properly labeled
and has been accessioned according to the pre-analytical SOP.
2. Reagent Preparation: Prepare reagents according to
manufacturer’s instructions. Ensure that reagents are at
appropriate temperature before use.
4.2. Calibration and Quality Control
1. Instrument Calibration: Perform calibration of the
ImmunoCAP system using calibration materials provided by the
manufacturer. Follow the calibration procedure as outlined in
the ImmunoCAP system manual.
2. Quality Control: Run internal control samples (both positive
and negative controls) to verify system performance. Ensure
that control results fall within acceptable ranges. Document the
quality control results.
4.3. Sample Analysis
1. Sample Loading:
◦ Load serum samples onto the sample racks.
◦ Place the sample racks in the appropriate position on the
ImmunoCAP system.
2. Reagent Loading:
◦ Load the specific IgE reagents for House Dust Mites
(Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus) into the reagent rack on
the ImmunoCAP system.
3. Initiate Run:
◦ Start the run on the ImmunoCAP system according to the
manufacturer’s protocol.
◦ Monitor the system to ensure there are no errors or alerts
during the run.
4. Result Generation:
◦ After the run is complete, retrieve results from the
ImmunoCAP system.
◦ Check results for any flags or errors that may need to be
addressed.
4.4. Review and Verification of Results
1. Initial Review: Review raw data for each sample, including
control results and calibration data, to ensure validity.
2. Verification: Cross-check patient and control values. Verify that
all internal controls are within expected ranges.
3. Data Entry: Enter validated results into the Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
4.5. Interpretative Guidelines
1. Reference Ranges and Units of Measurement:
◦ Specific IgE results are reported in kU/L (kilo units per liter).
◦ Reference ranges for House Dust Mites (Dermatophagoides
pteronyssinus) specific IgE should be followed as per the
test kit instructions or as defined by the laboratory’s clinical
governance.
4.6. Reporting Results
1. Result Reporting:
◦ Generate a test report through the LIS.
◦ Ensure correct patient identification and test information.
◦ Append interpretative comments where appropriate.
2. Critical Values:
◦ Report any critical high values to the requesting physician or
clinical team immediately.
◦ Document the notification of critical results according to
laboratory policy.
5. QUALITY ASSURANCE
Regular quality checks, calibrations, and proficiency testing must be
carried out to ensure the highest standard of test accuracy and
reliability. Documentation of these procedures must be maintained.
6. SAFETY AND WASTE DISPOSAL
1. Safety Precautions: Always use personal protective
equipment (PPE) when handling specimens and reagents.
2. Waste Disposal: Dispose of biohazardous waste and sharps
according to the laboratory’s waste disposal protocols.
