Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of House
Dust Panel, Serum Testing
1. PURPOSE
To ensure consistent, reliable, and accurate results for House Dust
Panel, Serum testing by following defined procedures for the
analytical phase, ensuring quality control and precise reporting.
Responsibility:
• Testing personnel are responsible for conducting the assay and
adhering to the procedures outlined in this SOP.
• Supervisors are responsible for overseeing the testing process,
ensuring staff compliance with this SOP, and addressing any
issues that arise during the assay.
1. SPECIMEN AND STORAGE REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type:
• Serum: A minimum of 0.5 mL of serum is required for testing.
Specimen Storage:
• Freshly collected serum specimens must be stored at 2-8°C if not
processed immediately.
• Serum specimens can be stored for up to 7 days at 2-8°C. For
longer storage, specimens must be frozen at -20°C or colder.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric specimens.
• Specimens stored at room temperature for more than 24 hours.
• Specimens received in unapproved containers or without
appropriate labeling and requisitions.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Automated Immunoassay Analyzer (e.g., Phadia 250)
• House Dust Panel Reagents (specific to the device used)
• Calibrators and Controls (low, medium, and high)
• Standard lab supplies (pipettes, tips, assay plates, storage tubes,
etc.)
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
1. PROCEDURE
4.1 Preparation:
• Allow all reagents, calibrators, and controls to come to room
temperature (20-25°C) before use.
• Ensure the immunoassay analyzer is calibrated and ready for
operation.
• Load the patient serum samples, calibrators, and quality control
samples onto the analyzer according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
4.2 Running the Test:
• Enter the test orders into the analyzer software, including patient
information and specific test panels.
• Initiate the assay run as per the manufacturer's instructions.
• Ensure that the analyzer software flags and records any
deviations or issues during the assay.
4.3 Interpretation of Results:
• Upon completion of the assay, review all obtained results to
ensure they are within the expected range.
• Any flagged results should be re-assessed and, if necessary, the
sample re-analyzed.
• Validate the results using the software and prepare them for
reporting.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
5.1 Internal Quality Control:
• Run low, medium, and high-control samples at the beginning and
at the end of each assay batch or as required by the
manufacturer's protocol.
• Record and analyze control results to ensure they fall within the
expected range.
• Any control results falling outside the acceptable range
necessitate repeating the assay or performing instrument
troubleshooting, followed by reassessing the controls.
5.2 External Quality Control:
• Participate in regular inter-laboratory proficiency testing to
compare and verify the accuracy and reliability of results.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results are automatically transmitted to the Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
• Technologists must review and verify all results before they are
released into the LIS.
• Results that fall outside the reference range should be flagged,
and repeat testing or alternative patient sample analysis may be
conducted as necessary.
• If any critical results are identified, follow protocol to notify the
attending physician immediately.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Interferences may occur due to pre-analytical issues such as
hemolysis, lipemia, and icterus, which may falsely elevate or
depress results.
• Specimen storage conditions can impact the stability of the
analytes.
• Ensure equipment maintenance and regular calibration as per the
manufacturer's guidelines to avoid drift or inaccuracy of results.
