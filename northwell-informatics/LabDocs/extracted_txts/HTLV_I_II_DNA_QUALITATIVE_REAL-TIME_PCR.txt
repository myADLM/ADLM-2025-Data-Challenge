HTLV I/II DNA, QUALITATIVE REAL-TIME PCR SOP
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to outline the steps for the
qualitative detection of Human T-cell Lymphotropic Virus (HTLV) I/II
DNA using Real-Time PCR. This test is designed for research use
and assists in the identification of HTLV I/II infection in patient
samples.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of laboratory personnel performing this assay to
ensure compliance with this procedure and to perform the test
accurately and efficiently. Supervisors are responsible for ensuring
that all personnel are adequately trained and competent.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen Type: Whole blood (EDTA) - Collected in lavender-top
EDTA tubes
Volume: Minimum 5 mL
Storage: Specimens should be kept at 2-8°C and must be processed
within 72 hours of collection. If processing is delayed beyond 72
hours, specimens must be frozen at -20°C or lower.
Unacceptable Specimens: - Specimens collected in anticoagulants
other than EDTA - Clotted specimens - Specimens with visible
hemolysis - Specimens collected in tubes with incorrect labels or
missing information
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment: - Real-Time PCR instrument (e.g., Applied Biosystems
7500 Real-Time PCR System) - DNA extraction system (e.g.,
QIAcube) - Microcentrifuge - Vortex mixer - Pipettes and pipette tips
(aerosol-resistant)
Reagents: - HTLV I/II DNA Real-Time PCR Kit (includes primers,
probes, and master mix) - DNA extraction kit (e.g., QIAamp DNA
Blood Mini Kit) - Nuclease-free water - Positive control (HTLV I/II DNA
positive control) - Negative control (Nuclease-free water)
Supplies: - PCR reaction tubes or plates - Microcentrifuge tubes -
Gloves - Lab coat - Safety goggles
1. PROCEDURE
A) DNA Extraction:
1. Follow the instructions provided with the DNA extraction kit to
extract genomic DNA from 200 µL of whole blood sample.
2. Elute the DNA in 100 µL of nuclease-free water.
3. Store the extracted DNA at 2-8°C if proceeding to PCR the
same day, or at -20°C for longer storage.
B) Real-Time PCR Setup:
1. Thaw all reagents (except enzyme) at room temperature and
maintain reagents on ice.
2. Prepare the PCR master mix in a clean microcentrifuge tube
according to the manufacturer’s instructions (e.g., HTLV I/II
DNA Real-Time PCR Kit). Include the following components per
reaction:
◦ Master mix
◦ Primers and probes
◦ Nuclease-free water
3. Aliquot the master mix into PCR reaction tubes or plates.
4. Add 5 µL of extracted DNA to the corresponding reaction tubes/
wells for patient samples.
5. Include a positive control and a negative control in each PCR
run.
6. Seal the PCR reaction tubes or plates.
C) Real-Time PCR Run:
1. Program the Real-Time PCR instrument with the appropriate
cycling conditions:
◦ Initial denaturation at 95°C for 10 minutes
◦ 45 cycles of:
▪ Denaturation at 95°C for 15 seconds
▪ Annealing/Extension at 60°C for 1 minute
2. Load the PCR reaction tubes or plates into the instrument.
3. Start the PCR run.
D) Interpretation of Results:
1. Analyze the data using the Real-Time PCR software according
to the manufacturer's instructions.
2. Positive Control: The positive control must amplify and produce
a characteristic amplification curve.
3. Negative Control: The negative control must not produce any
amplification.
4. Patient Samples:
◦ Positive: A sample is considered positive if it produces a
characteristic amplification curve with a Ct value within the
acceptable range (as defined by the kit instructions).
◦ Negative: A sample is considered negative if it does not
produce any amplification curve, or the Ct value exceeds
the threshold for positivity.
E) Quality Control:
1. Ensure that both positive and negative controls are included in
each run.
2. Document control results on the respective Quality Control Log.
3. If quality control results are not within acceptable limits, repeat
the run. Do not report patient results until QC criteria are met.
4. REPORTING RESULTS
5. Report results to the clinician with the following interpretations:
◦ Positive: HTLV I/II DNA detected
◦ Negative: HTLV I/II DNA not detected
◦ Indeterminate: Results are inconclusive; recommend repeat
testing
6. Record results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS) and
ensure all data is reviewed and verified by a qualified
technologist.
7. METHOD LIMITATIONS
8. False positives or false negatives may occur due to improper
sample collection, handling, or contamination.
9. The strategy depends on the initial concentration of HTLV I/II
DNA in the sample.
10. Ensure all procedures are carried out in accordance with
contamination prevention protocols to minimize cross-
contamination.
