Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase for Generating Results for Human Anti-Mouse
Antibody (HAMA)
1. PURPOSE
To establish a standardized procedure for the analysis and
generation of results for Human Anti-Mouse Antibody (HAMA) in
patient samples using the specified HAMA assay kit. The protocol
ensures accuracy, consistency, and reliability of reported HAMA
results.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel responsible for the
analytical phase of HAMA testing, following specimen collection,
receipt, and accessioning.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the HAMA
assay, recording results, and taking corrective actions when
necessary. The supervisor is responsible for ensuring compliance
with this procedure.
4. PROCEDURE
A. Pre-Analytical Setup:
1. Materials and Equipment:
◦ HAMA assay kit (manufacturer's specified reagents and
equipment)
◦ Calibrated pipettes and tips
◦ Centrifuge
◦ Microplate reader (compatible with the assay kit)
◦ Laboratory timer
◦ Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
◦ Test tubes or microplates
◦ Distilled or deionized water
◦ Sample handling and labeling materials (labels, markers)
2. Reagents Preparation:
◦ Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for reagent
preparation.
◦ Bring all reagents and samples to room temperature before
use.
◦ Prepare diluted standards and controls as per the assay kit
instructions.
3. Quality Control:
◦ Include internal QC samples provided in the HAMA assay
kit.
◦ Run positive and negative controls with each batch of
samples.
◦ Document all QC results in the QC log.
B. Analytical Procedure:
1. Sample Preparation:
◦ Verify sample identity against requisition forms.
◦ Ensure samples are free from contamination and hemolysis.
◦ Centrifuge blood samples at 1500-2000 RPM for 10 minutes
to obtain serum/plasma.
◦ Use clear, appropriately labeled tubes for sample aliquots.
2. Assay Protocol: a. Adding Samples:
◦ Add predetermined volume of each patient sample to
designated wells in the microplate.
◦ Pipette standards and controls into appropriate wells. b.
Incubation:
◦ Incubate the samples and reagents per the manufacturer's
instructions (e.g., 1 hour at room temperature).
◦ Ensure that the incubation environment (temperature and
humidity) is stable and within acceptable limits. c. Washing
Steps:
◦ Wash each well rigorously as per the assay kit's specified
number and type of wash steps. d. Addition of Conjugate:
◦ Add the enzyme-conjugate reagent to each well.
◦ Incubate for specified time and conditions. e. Final Wash
and Detection:
◦ Perform the final wash steps as required.
◦ Add the substrate solution and incubate for the color
development phase.
3. Reading & Result Generation:
◦ Use a microplate reader to measure absorbance at the
specified wavelength (e.g., 450 nm).
◦ Record absorbance values and calculate results using the
standard curve.
◦ If absorbance values are outside the standard range, repeat
the assay or consult the supervisor.
C. Post-Analytical Procedure:
1. Result Documentation:
◦ Record all data in the patient result logbook and laboratory
information system (LIS).
◦ Ensure proper documentation of patient ID, sample ID,
assay date, and operator initials.
2. Review and Verification:
◦ Review results for any deviations and repeat testing if
necessary.
◦ Verify results against control values.
◦ Supervisor validation may be required for unusual or critical
results.
3. Reporting Results:
◦ Report results according to site-specific guidelines.
◦ Ensure timely communication of critical or non-compatible
results to the appropriate clinical team.

6. QUALITY CONTROL AND TROUBLESHOOTING
• Follow established QC procedures using internal controls.
• If QC results are out of acceptable limits, perform troubleshooting
steps including reagent checks, equipment calibration, and
technique verification.
