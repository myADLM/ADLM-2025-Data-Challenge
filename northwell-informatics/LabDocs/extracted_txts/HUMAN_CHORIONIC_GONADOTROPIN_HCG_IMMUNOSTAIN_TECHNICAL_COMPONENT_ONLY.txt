Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
HUMAN CHORIONIC GONADOTROPIN (HCG) IMMUNOSTAIN,
TECHNICAL COMPONENT ONLY
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the procedure for performing the
immunohistochemical staining of Human Chorionic Gonadotropin
(HCG) on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to laboratory personnel responsible for
conducting HCG immunostaining in the anatomical pathology
laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of trained histotechnologists to perform this
procedure accurately and to document all necessary information.
Supervisors must ensure that all personnel are properly trained and
that the procedure is being followed correctly.
4. MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT
• Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections
• Microtome
• Positive Control slide (Prepare from a known positive tissue for
each batch)
• Negative Control slide (Replace primary antibody with antibody
diluent)
• Xylene
• Ethanol (100%, 95%, 70%)
• Distilled water
• Tris Buffered Saline (TBS)
• HCG primary antibody
• Secondary antibody (appropriate for the primary antibody species,
conjugated to a detectable label, e.g., HRP)
• DAB (3,3'-Diaminobenzidine) reagent or equivalent chromogen
• Hematoxylin counterstain
• Mounting medium
• Coverslips
• Incubator set to 37°C
• Humidified chamber
• Staining rack
• Light microscope
5. PROCEDURE
5.1 Preparation of Tissue Sections
• Cut 3-4 µm thick sections from paraffin-embedded tissue blocks
using a microtome.
• Float sections on a water bath at 40°C and pick up sections on
positively charged glass slides.
• Bake slides in an oven set at 60°C for at least 30 minutes or
overnight.
5.2 Deparaffinization and Rehydration
• Place slides in a staining rack.
• Deparaffinize slides by immersing them in xylene for 10 minutes,
three times.
• Rehydrate slides by passing them through descending grades of
ethanol (100% for 2x5 minutes, 95% for 2x5 minutes, 70% for 1x5
minutes).
• Rinse slides in distilled water for 5 minutes to remove residual
ethanol.
5.3 Antigen Retrieval
• Perform antigen retrieval by immersing slides in a retrieval
solution (determined by primary antibody datasheet) and heating
in a microwave or pressure cooker as specified by the antibody
manufacturer.
• Allow slides to cool for 20 minutes at room temperature and then
rinse in TBS twice for 5 minutes each.
5.4 Blocking
• Apply a protein block to each section to prevent non-specific
binding. Incubate for 10 minutes in a humidified chamber.
5.5 Primary Antibody Application
• Apply HCG primary antibody to each tissue section according to
the manufacturer’s recommended dilution and incubate in a
humidified chamber for 30-60 minutes at room temperature.
• Rinse slides in TBS twice for 5 minutes each.
5.6 Secondary Antibody Application
• Apply an appropriate secondary antibody conjugated to HRP to
each section and incubate for 30 minutes at room temperature in
a humidified chamber.
• Rinse slides in TBS twice for 5 minutes each.
5.7 Visualization
• Prepare DAB chromogen according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
• Apply DAB reagent to each section and incubate for a period
specified by the manufacturer, typically 5-10 minutes.
• Monitor the development of color under a light microscope.
• Rinse slides in distilled water to stop the reaction.
5.8 Counterstaining
• Counterstain slides with hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes.
• Rinse in distilled water for 2 minutes.
• Blue slides in TBS for 1 minute.
5.9 Dehydration and Mounting
• Dehydrate sections by passing through ascending ethanol (70%
for 1 minute, 95% for 2x1 minute, 100% for 2x1 minute).
• Clear in xylene 2x5 minutes.
• Mount sections with appropriate mounting medium and cover with
coverslips.
5.10 Quality Control
• Include a positive and negative control with each staining batch.
• Verify acceptable control results before interpreting patient
samples.
6. RESULTS INTERPRETATION
• Observe stained slides under a light microscope.
• Presence of brown chromogen indicates positive HCG
expression.
• Quality control slides must show appropriate staining for results to
be valid.
7. DOCUMENTATION
• Record all temperatures, times, and observations in the laboratory
logbook.
• Document any deviations from the protocol and corrective actions
taken.

• Manufacturer's instructions for HCG primary antibody.
• Internal laboratory manuals and guidelines for
immunohistochemical staining.
