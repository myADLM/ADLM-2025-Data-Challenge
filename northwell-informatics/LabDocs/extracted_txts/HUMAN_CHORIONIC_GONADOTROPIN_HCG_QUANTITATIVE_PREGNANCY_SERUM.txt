Standard Operating Procedure Human Chorionic Gonadotropin
(HCG), Quantitative, Pregnancy, Serum
I. PURPOSE The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedures for
the analysis of Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (HCG) quantitatively
in pregnancy using serum samples.
II. SCOPE This procedure applies to all clinical laboratory personnel
responsible for the quantitative analysis of HCG in serum for the
detection and monitoring of pregnancy.
III. RESPONSIBILITY It is the responsibility of the laboratory
personnel performing the analysis to follow this procedure accurately
and precisely. It is the responsibility of the laboratory supervisor to
ensure that quality control and proficiency testing are performed as
described.
IV. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS A. Collection and Handling:
1. Preferred specimen: Serum.
2. Collect blood in a serum separator tube (SST).
3. Allow the blood to clot for 30 minutes and then centrifuge at
1500 x g for 10 minutes.
4. Transfer the serum to a clean, appropriately labeled tube if not
performed in SST.
5. Store serum specimens at 2-8°C if analysis is to be performed
within 48 hours. For longer storage, freeze at -20°C or lower.
B. Unacceptable Conditions:
1. Specimens that are grossly hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric.
2. Specimens in tubes containing anticoagulants such as EDTA,
heparin, or citrate.
3. Improperly labeled specimens or those not stored under the
recommended conditions.
V. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS A. Equipment:
1. Automated immunoassay analyzer
2. Centrifuge
3. Micropipettes and tips
4. Vortex mixer
B. Reagents:
1. HCG reagent kit compatible with the automated immunoassay
analyzer.
2. Calibrators and controls provided with the reagent kit.
3. Distilled or deionized water.
VI. QUALITY CONTROL A. Internal Quality Control:
1. Run at least two levels of quality control (QC) material (low and
high) with each batch of patient samples.
2. Verify that QC results are within the acceptance ranges before
reporting patient results. If QC results are outside the
acceptable ranges, troubleshoot and repeat the QC samples.
B. Proficiency Testing (PT):
1. Participate in external proficiency testing programs as required.
2. Review PT results to ensure performance criteria are met.
VII. PROCEDURE A. Calibration:
1. Perform calibration of the immunoassay analyzer as per the
manufacturer's instructions using the calibrators provided with
the reagent kit.
2. Document the calibration and verify the results before
proceeding with patient sample analysis.
B. Sample Analysis:
1. Ensure that the immunoassay analyzer's maintenance and
performance checks are completed before starting the analysis.
2. Vortex each patient serum sample for 5 seconds before
analysis.
3. Load the serum samples, calibrators, and QC samples into the
specified positions of the analyzer.
4. Enter the sample identification information into the analyzer.
5. Select the HCG quantitative assay protocol as per the
instrument's instructions.
6. Start the analysis as per the manufacturer's recommended
settings and procedures.
C. Reporting Results:
1. Review result data from the analyzer for consistency and any
flags.
2. Confirm that QC results are within acceptable ranges before
verifying patient results.
3. Report HCG results in mIU/mL as per the reportable dynamic
range specified by the reagent kit.
4. For results that are significantly higher or lower than expected,
consider re-running the specimen.
VIII. REFERENCE INTERVALS A. Non-pregnant individuals: < 5
mIU/mL B. Pregnant individuals: The HCG levels will vary
significantly based on the gestational age. Refer to the provided
reference intervals included in the kit insert (e.g., 1,000 - 50,000 mIU/
mL at 4-5 weeks of gestation).
IX. METHOD LIMITATIONS A. Refer to the reagent kit's package
insert for detailed information on the limitations, cross-reactivity, and
potential interferences of the specific HCG assay used. B.
Heterophile antibodies in human serum can cause interference in
immunoassays. Review any unexpected or inconsistent results
carefully and consider additional confirmatory testing if necessary.
X. REFERENCES A. Manufacturer's package insert for the HCG
reagent kit. B. Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI)
guidelines for immunoassay and hormone testing. C. Laboratory SOP
for specimen handling and processing.
Note: This SOP should be reviewed annually and whenever there are
changes to the analytical methods, reagent kits, or instruments used
in the assay.
