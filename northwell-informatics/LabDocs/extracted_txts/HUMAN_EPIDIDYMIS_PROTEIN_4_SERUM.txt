Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for
the Analytical Phase of Generating Results
for Human Epididymis Protein 4 (HE4),
Serum
1. PURPOSE
This procedure outlines the steps to be followed for the analytical
phase of generating results for Human Epididymis Protein 4 (HE4) in
serum samples. This protocol ensures accurate, reliable, and
reproducible results.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel involved in the analysis
of HE4 in serum samples in a CLIA-certified laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all designated laboratory personnel to adhere
to this SOP. Laboratory supervisors are responsible for ensuring
compliance with this procedure.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred specimens: Serum samples.
• Collection: Collect blood in a serum separator tube (SST).
• Preparation: Allow the blood to clot for 30 minutes at room
temperature before centrifugation.
• Centrifugation: Centrifuge the SST at 1,300 x g for 10 minutes to
separate serum.
• Storage: Serum samples should be stored at 2-8°C if analyzed
within 72 hours. For longer storage, freeze at -20°C or lower.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• HE4 assay kit (refer to manufacturer’s specifications)
• Automated immunoassay analyzer
• Calibrators and controls specific to the HE4 assay
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Test tubes and racks
• Timer
6. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation of Reagents and Calibrators
1. Prepare all reagents, calibrators, and controls according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Allow all reagents and samples to reach room temperature
before use.
3. Mix reagents gently by inverting. Do not vortex.
B. Calibration
1. Calibrate the analyzer according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
2. Use the specified calibrators.
3. Perform a full calibration:
◦ At least once every month.
◦ After any major maintenance.
◦ When a new lot number of reagents is introduced.
◦ Whenever a significant shift in quality control results is
observed.
4. Document calibration results in the laboratory record.
C. Quality Control
1. Run quality control samples at the beginning of each analytical
run and after every batch of 20 samples.
2. Use at least two levels of controls (e.g., normal and high).
3. Document and review QC results. Ensure they are within the
established limits before proceeding with patient samples.
4. Investigate and resolve any QC failures before continuing with
sample analysis.
D. Sample Analysis
1. Label test tubes or racks with the corresponding test number.
2. Load serum samples, calibrators, and controls onto the
analyzer.
3. Program the analyzer with the appropriate test parameters.
4. Start the run and monitor the analyzer for any errors or issues.
5. Upon completion, review initial reports generated by the
instrument.
6. Record the sample ID, date, and time of analysis into the
laboratory information system (LIS).
7. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
1. Review and validate the results generated by the analyzer.
2. Criteria for acceptance:
◦ Ensure both QC and calibrator results fall within the
predefined acceptable ranges.
◦ Verify that all analyte results are within the reportable range,
repeat analysis if necessary.
3. Results that fall outside the clinically significant limits should be
flagged and rechecked.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Transmit validated results from the analyzer to the LIS.
2. Verify and review results in the LIS before reporting.
3. Critical values should be flagged and reported immediately to
the responsible clinician.
9. QUALITY ASSURANCE AND TROUBLESHOOTING
1. Regularly review and update SOPs as needed.
2. Perform periodic proficiency testing.
3. Document any deviations from the procedure and corrective
actions taken.
4. Troubleshoot any issues with the HE4 assay following
manufacturer’s instructions and consult the technical support if
necessary.
