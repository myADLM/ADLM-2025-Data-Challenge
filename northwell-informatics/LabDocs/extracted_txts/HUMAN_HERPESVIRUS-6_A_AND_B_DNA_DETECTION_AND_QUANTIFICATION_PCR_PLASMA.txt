Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) HUMAN HERPESVIRUS-6
A AND B DNA DETECTION AND QUANTIFICATION, PCR,
PLASMA
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the procedure for the detection and quantification
of Human Herpesvirus-6 (HHV-6) types A and B DNA in plasma
specimens using Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR).
2. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated trained medical laboratory scientists (MLS) are
responsible for performing the PCR testing and ensuring the
accuracy and reliability of results. It is the responsibility of the
supervising laboratory manager to ensure all equipment is calibrated,
and quality control measures are in place.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Real-Time PCR Instrument (e.g., ABI 7500, CFX96)
• PCR Workstation
• Microcentrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Pipettes and filter tips
• Plasma separation tubes (PST)
• HHV-6 A/B Real-Time PCR Kit (specific primers and probes)
• Nucleic Acid Extraction Kit
• Nuclease-free water
• Positive and negative controls
• Ice bucket
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Acceptable:
• Plasma specimens collected in EDTA tubes.
• Specimens should be separated within 2 hours of collection and
stored at -80°C until analysis.
Unacceptable:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
• Specimens not stored properly (i.e., thawed and refrozen multiple
times).
5. PROCEDURE
5.1 Nucleic Acid Extraction:
1. Thaw plasma specimens on ice.
2. Extract viral DNA using the nucleic acid extraction kit as per
manufacturer instructions.
◦ Add plasma to lysis buffer.
◦ Perform washing steps to purify DNA.
◦ Elute DNA in an appropriate volume of elution buffer.
5.2 Preparation of PCR Master Mix:
1. Prepare the PCR master mix according to the Real-Time PCR
kit instructions, ensuring all components (primers, probes,
dNTPs, buffer, and polymerase) are included.
2. Prepare enough master mix to include samples, controls, and
no-template control (NTC).
3. Aliquot the master mix into a PCR plate or tubes on ice.
5.3 Sample and Control Addition:
1. Add 5 µL of extracted DNA from each sample to the
corresponding wells.
2. Add 5 µL of positive control DNA to the designated well.
3. Add 5 µL of negative control (nuclease-free water) to the
designated well.
5.4 PCR Amplification:
1. Place the PCR plate/tubes in the Real-Time PCR instrument.
2. Set up the PCR run with the following cycling conditions:
◦ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 10 minutes
◦ Amplification cycles (45 cycles):
▪ Denaturation: 95°C for 15 seconds
▪ Annealing/Extension: 60°C for 1 minute
3. Set the Real-Time PCR software to detect and quantify HHV-6
A and B-specific signals.
5.5 Data Analysis:
1. Upon completion of the PCR run, analyze the data using the
Real-Time PCR software.
2. Identify positive results by the presence of exponential
amplification curves crossing the threshold line. Quantify using
the standard curve method if a standard curve is available.
3. Compare the results of the controls:
◦ Positive control should show expected amplification.
◦ Negative control should show no amplification.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Run positive and negative controls with each batch of tests.
2. Monitor and document PCR instrument performance and
maintenance.
3. Review amplification plots and ensure no cross-contamination
by observing no amplification in NTC wells.
4. Record all quality control data and take corrective actions if the
controls do not perform as expected.
7. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
• Positive result: Presence of HHV-6 A or B DNA in the plasma
specimen.
• Negative result: Absence of amplifiable HHV-6 A or B DNA in the
plasma specimen.
• Quantification: Report as copies/mL if a standard curve is used.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results will be recorded in the laboratory information system (LIS)
and reviewed by the MLS before reporting.
• Critical/positive results will be communicated to the requesting
physician as per laboratory policy.
• Refer to site-specific reporting guidelines for documentation and
communication of results.
9. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions for the HHV-6 A/B Real-Time PCR Kit.
• Internal laboratory quality control protocols.
• Current standards and guidelines for PCR-based diagnostics in
clinical laboratories.
10. RECORD KEEPING
Maintain a log of all testing performed including sample IDs, control
results, and any deviations or issues encountered during testing. All
records should be kept in accordance with laboratory policy and
regulatory requirements.
