Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Human Herpesvirus-6 A and B DNA Detection and
Quantification, PCR, Spinal Fluid
1. PURPOSE: To provide a standard procedure for the detection and
quantification of Human Herpesvirus-6 (HHV-6) types A and B DNA in
spinal fluid samples using Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)
technology.
2. SCOPE: This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel performing
HHV-6 A and B DNA detection and quantification in spinal fluid using
PCR within the facility.
3. RESPONSIBILITY:
• It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory personnel to
carry out the procedure as outlined in this protocol.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring personnel are
adequately trained and adhere to this SOP.
• All personnel must adhere to health and safety guidelines and
proper laboratory practices.
4. DEFINITIONS:
• PCR: Polymerase Chain Reaction, a technique used to amplify
and detect DNA sequences.
• HHV-6: Human Herpesvirus-6, a common virus with two variants
(A and B) that can infect humans.
• Spinal Fluid: Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) collected for diagnostic
testing.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES:
• Real-time PCR Instrument (e.g., Applied Biosystems 7500)
• PCR reagents and Master Mixes specific for HHV-6 A and B
• Nuclease-free water
• Microcentrifuge tubes, PCR tubes, and reaction plates
• Pipettes and sterile pipette tips with aerosol barriers
• DNA extraction kit for CSF samples
• Positive and negative controls
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
6. PROCEDURE:
6.1. Specimen Preparation:
• Ensure the CSF sample has been properly collected, labeled, and
stored at 4-8°C if processed within 24 hours; otherwise, store at
-80°C.
• Thaw frozen samples at room temperature before proceeding to
DNA extraction.
6.2. DNA Extraction:
• Perform DNA extraction from CSF samples using an appropriate
DNA extraction kit following the manufacturer's instructions.
• Elute the DNA in a final volume as specified by the kit protocol.
• Store extracted DNA at -20°C until ready for PCR setup.
6.3. PCR Setup:
• Thaw all reagents (master mix, primers, probes, nuclease-free
water) and samples on ice.
• Prepare the PCR master mix according to the following general
formula (quantities may vary depending on the manufacturer's
protocol):
◦ PCR Master Mix
◦ HHV-6 A/B Primers and Probes
◦ Nuclease-free water
◦ Extracted DNA sample (template DNA)
• Prepare a separate reaction mix for each sample, including
negative control (nuclease-free water) and positive control (known
HHV-6 DNA).
6.4. PCR Amplification:
• Set up the reaction plate/tubes in the real-time PCR instrument.
• Program the thermal cycler according to the optimized cycling
conditions (typically including initial denaturation, amplification
cycles, and final extension.)
◦ Initial Denaturation: 95°C for 10 minutes
◦ Amplification Cycles: 95°C for 15 seconds (denaturation),
60°C for 1 minute (annealing/extension) - Repeat for 40 cycles
• Start the PCR run ensuring all wells are securely sealed.
6.5. Post-PCR Analysis:
• After the run completion, analyze the data using the software
associated with the PCR instrument.
• The detection threshold should be set based on the control
reactions.
• Quantify the HHV-6 DNA by comparing the fluorescence signal
relative to the standard curve generated by the positive control.
7. QUALITY CONTROL:
• Include internal controls (positive and negative controls) in each
run to ensure the integrity and accuracy of the PCR assay.
• If the controls do not perform as expected, the run should be
considered invalid, and samples must be retested.
8. REPORTING RESULTS:
• Results should be reviewed and approved by designated
personnel before reporting.
• Report should include quantitative result (e.g., copies/mL) and
interpretive comment as appropriate.
• Notify the responsible clinician immediately if the detected levels
are clinically significant.
9. LIMITATIONS:
• Poor DNA quality or insufficient quantity can affect the sensitivity
and accuracy of PCR results.
• PCR inhibitors present in the sample may result in false-negative
results.
• Proper handling and storage of CSF samples are critical.
10. REFERENCES:
• Manufacturer’s instructions for DNA extraction kits and PCR
reagents.
• Relevant Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI)
guidelines.
• Applicable peer-reviewed scientific literature.
11. REVISION LOG:
• Document any revisions to the SOP including date and summary
of changes made.
