Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Human Herpes Virus-6
(HHV-6) DNA Detection by PCR
1. PURPOSE
To provide accurate and reliable detection of Human Herpes Virus-6
(HHV-6) DNA in clinical specimens using real-time Polymerase Chain
Reaction (PCR).
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory staff is responsible for performing the
HHV-6 DNA detection by PCR as described in this procedure.
• It is the responsibility of the laboratory supervisor to ensure all
staff are trained and the procedure is followed accurately.
• All staff must ensure accurate recording and reporting of results.
1. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all clinical specimens collected for the detection
of HHV-6 DNA.
1. DEFINITIONS
PCR: Polymerase Chain Reaction, a technique used to amplify and
detect specific DNA sequences. HHV-6: Human Herpes Virus-6, a
common virus that can cause various health conditions.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Acceptable Specimens: Whole blood, serum, plasma,
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and tissue biopsies.
• Unacceptable Specimens: Specimens not appropriately labeled,
significantly hemolyzed, lipemic, or anticoagulated with
substances other than EDTA.
1. REAGENTS AND EQUIPMENT
• PCR Master Mix (containing Taq polymerase, dNTPs, buffer, and
MgCl2)
• HHV-6 specific primers and probes
• DNA extraction kit
• Real-time PCR instrumentation (e.g., ABI 7500, Bio-Rad CFX96)
• Microcentrifuge tubes, pipettes, and filtered tips
• Negative control (no template control)
• Positive control (known HHV-6 DNA)
1. DNA EXTRACTION
2. Specimen Preparation:
◦ For whole blood, serum, plasma: Use the DNA extraction kit
as per manufacturer’s instruction.
◦ For CSF and tissue biopsies: Follow specific extraction
protocols suitable for these specimen types.
3. DNA Quantification:
◦ Quantify the extracted DNA using a spectrophotometer.
DNA concentration should be within the recommended
range (typically 10-100 ng/µL).
4. PCR SETUP
5. Prepare the PCR Master Mix:
◦ Thaw all reagents on ice prior to use.
◦ In a sterile microcentrifuge tube on ice, prepare the PCR
Master Mix by adding the following:
▪ PCR buffer – as per kit instructions
▪ dNTPs – 200 µM
▪ MgCl2 – 1.5 mM
▪ HHV-6 specific forward and reverse primers – final
concentration 500 nM each
▪ HHV-6 specific probe – final concentration 250 nM
▪ Taq polymerase – as per kit instructions
▪ Nuclease-free water – to final volume
6. Aliquot PCR Master Mix:
◦ Aliquot equal volumes of Master Mix into PCR tubes or a
96-well PCR plate.
◦ Add 5 µL of extracted DNA to each aliquot of Master Mix in
the PCR tubes.
◦ Include a Negative Control (add nuclease-free water instead
of DNA) and a Positive Control (add 5 µL of known HHV-6
DNA).
7. PCR CYCLING CONDITIONS
8. Set up the real-time PCR instrument with the following cycling
conditions:
◦ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 10 minutes
◦ 40 cycles of:
▪ Denaturation: 95°C for 15 seconds
▪ Annealing/Extension: 60°C for 1 minute (data collection
during this step)
9. Program the instrument to perform fluorescence detection
during the annealing/extension step.
10. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
11. Review amplification plots for each sample and control.
◦ Negative Control: No amplification signal should be
observed.
◦ Positive Control: Clear amplification signal should be
observed.
◦ Patient Specimens: Assess Ct (threshold cycle) values.
12. Data Analysis:
◦ A Ct value ≤38 indicates a positive result for HHV-6 DNA.
◦ A Ct value >38 or no Ct value indicates a negative result for
HHV-6 DNA.
13. Reporting:
◦ Positive results: "HHV-6 DNA Detected"
◦ Negative results: "HHV-6 DNA Not Detected"
◦ Inconclusive results or samples with contamination:
"Inconclusive, please repeat testing"
14. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform Quality Control (QC) for each PCR run by including
Positive and Negative Controls.
• Monthly correlations should be conducted between different real-
time PCR machines when in use.
• Document all QC results in the logbook.
1. DOCUMENTATION
• Record all specimen information, and results in the Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
• Maintain a logbook for PCR setup, QC results, and any
troubleshooting performed.
