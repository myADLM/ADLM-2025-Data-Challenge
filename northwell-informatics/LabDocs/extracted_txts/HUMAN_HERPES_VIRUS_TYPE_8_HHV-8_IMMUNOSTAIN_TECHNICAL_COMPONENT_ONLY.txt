STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP)
Protocol for Analytical Phase of Generating Results for HUMAN
HERPES VIRUS, TYPE 8 (HHV-8) IMMUNOSTAIN, TECHNICAL
COMPONENT ONLY
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedures for the analytical
phase of generating results for Human Herpes Virus, Type 8 (HHV-8)
immunostain, technical component only. This includes staining,
quality control, documentation, and reporting.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
All designated staff are responsible for performing the procedures as
outlined in this SOP. Supervisors are responsible for ensuring that
these procedures are properly implemented and maintained.
3. DEFINITION
HHV-8 immunostain is used to detect the presence of HHV-8
antigens in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections. The
technical component involves the application of specific antibodies to
the tissue section, visualizing the antigen-antibody reaction through
chromogenic detection.
4. SPECIMEN ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
• Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue blocks or sections.
• Properly labeled specimen with collection date, patient
identification, and requisition form.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• Microscopic slides.
• Primary antibodies specific to HHV-8.
• Secondary antibodies conjugated with a chromogen, typically
horseradish peroxidase (HRP).
• Chromogenic substrate (e.g. DAB - diaminobenzidine).
• Tissue processing and staining instruments.
• Positive and negative control slides.
• Wash buffers (e.g. PBS - phosphate-buffered saline).
• Mounting medium.
• Coverslips.
• Incubators.
6. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation of Tissue Sections
1. Cut formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue blocks into 3-4
micron sections using a microtome.
2. Mount sections on positively charged microscopic slides.
3. Bake slides at 60°C for 1 hour to ensure tissue adhesion.
B) Immunostaining Procedure
1. Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
◦ Deparaffinize slides in xylene for 10 minutes, then rehydrate
through graded alcohols (100%, 95%, 70%) to water.
2. Antigen Retrieval:
◦ Perform heat-induced antigen retrieval in citrate buffer (pH
6.0) using a pressure cooker or microwave for 10 minutes.
Allow slides to cool to room temperature.
3. Blocking:
◦ Incubate sections with blocking solution (e.g., 3% hydrogen
peroxide) for 10 minutes to quench endogenous peroxidase
activity, followed by blocking with serum-free protein
blocking solution for 15 minutes to prevent nonspecific
binding.
4. Primary Antibody Incubation:
◦ Incubate sections with primary antibody specific to HHV-8,
diluted to manufacturer’s recommended concentration, for 1
hour at room temperature.
5. Washing:
◦ Wash slides 3 times in PBS for 5 minutes each.
6. Secondary Antibody Incubation:
◦ Incubate sections with HRP-conjugated secondary antibody
for 30 minutes at room temperature.
7. Washing:
◦ Wash slides 3 times in PBS for 5 minutes each.
8. Chromogenic Detection:
◦ Incubate sections with chromogenic substrate (e.g., DAB)
for 5 minutes or until desired stain intensity is achieved.
9. Counterstaining:
◦ Counterstain with hematoxylin for 1 minute to visualize
tissue morphology.
10. Final Wash and Dehydration:
◦ Wash slides in running tap water for 5 minutes, followed by
dehydration through graded alcohols to xylene.
11. Mounting:
◦ Apply mounting medium and coverslip.
C) Quality Control
1. Positive Control:
◦ Include a positive control slide to validate the staining
procedure. The control should show expected positive
staining for HHV-8.
2. Negative Control:
◦ Include a negative control slide (no primary antibody) to
check for nonspecific staining.
D) Documentation and Reporting
1. Document the staining procedure, antibody lot numbers, and
incubation times in the laboratory log.
2. Examine slides microscopically for the presence of HHV-8
antigen.
3. Report findings in conjunction with clinical pathologist’s
interpretation.
4. Record results and any deviations in the lab log for future
reference.
7. REFERENCE RANGES
Interpretation will be reported qualitatively as:
• Positive: HHV-8 antigens are present.
• Negative: HHV-8 antigens are not detected.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the manufacturer's insert for limitations specific to primary
and secondary antibodies or chromogenic reagents used.
