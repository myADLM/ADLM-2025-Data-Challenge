Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for HLA-DR-DQ Disease
Association Typing Low Resolution, Blood
1. PURPOSE
This SOP is designed to outline the analytical process for conducting
HLA-DR and HLA-DQ typing using low-resolution techniques on
blood samples. Accurate identification of HLA alleles is crucial for
disease association studies, organ transplantation, and clinical
diagnostics.
1. SCOPE AND RESPONSIBILITIES
This procedure applies to all personnel within the clinical immunology
laboratory involved in the analytical phase of HLA typing.
• Responsibility: Designated laboratory technologists and
supervisors are responsible for performing and overseeing the
HLA typing process, troubleshooting any issues, and ensuring
accurate and timely reporting of results.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred Specimen: 5 mL of whole blood collected in an EDTA
(lavender-top) tube.
• Specimen Stability: The specimen should be processed within
48 hours of collection. If delayed, the sample should be stored at
2-8°C and processed within 72 hours.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• PCR Thermal Cycler
• Electrophoresis Equipment (gel tank, power supply, UV
transilluminator)
• DNA Extraction Kit
• PCR Reagents: Primers, Taq Polymerase, dNTPs
• HLA-DR and HLA-DQ typing kits
• Agarose gel, ethidium bromide or alternative safe stain
• DNA Ladder and Loading Dye
• Micropipettes and sterile filter tips
• Gloves and appropriate PPE
1. PROCEDURE
A. DNA Extraction:
1. Prepare Sample:
◦ Mix the blood sample thoroughly by gentle inversion.
2. Extraction:
◦ Use a DNA extraction kit per the manufacturer's instructions.
◦ Verify the quality and quantity of the extracted DNA using a
spectrophotometer.
B. PCR Amplification:
1. Preparation:
◦ Set up a PCR master mix with the following components:
▪ Taq Polymerase
▪ dNTPs
▪ Primers specific for HLA-DR and HLA-DQ loci
▪ Extracted DNA template
▪ PCR buffer
▪ MgCl2
2. Cycling Conditions:
◦ Program the thermal cycler for the following:
▪ Initial Denaturation: 95°C for 5 minutes
▪ 35 Cycles of:
▪ Denaturation: 95°C for 30 seconds
▪ Annealing: 55°C for 45 seconds
▪ Extension: 72°C for 60 seconds
▪ Final Extension: 72°C for 7 minutes
◦ Hold at 4°C until further processing.
C. Gel Electrophoresis:
1. Gel Preparation:
◦ Prepare a 2% agarose gel with ethidium bromide or an
alternative safe stain.
◦ Pour gel into a casting tray and insert comb to create wells.
2. Electrophoresis:
◦ Mix PCR product with loading dye.
◦ Load DNA ladder and PCR products into gel wells.
◦ Run the gel at 100V for approximately 45 minutes.
3. Visualization:
◦ View the gel under a UV transilluminator.
◦ Capture images of the gel for record-keeping and analysis.
D. Interpretation:
1. Allele Determination:
◦ Compare band patterns of the PCR products to the HLA-DR
and HLA-DQ typing kits’ reference patterns.
◦ Assign the low-resolution HLA types based on observed
banding patterns.
2. Quality Control:
◦ Include positive and negative controls in each run to ensure
the accuracy and validity of the results.
◦ Perform regular verification and calibration of equipment as
per laboratory standards.
3. RESULT REPORTING
• Results should be documented in the laboratory information
system (LIS).
• Review results for consistency and accuracy before verification.
• Report any issues or discrepancies to the supervisor immediately.
1. QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE
• Perform routine QC using known HLA types.
• Conduct periodic proficiency testing to ensure adherence to
standards.
• Document any deviations and corrective actions taken.
