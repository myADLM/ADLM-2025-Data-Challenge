Protocol for Human Leukocyte Antigens (HLA) A-B-C Disease
Association Typing Low Resolution on Blood
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standard procedure for Human Leukocyte Antigens
(HLA) Class I (HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C) disease association
typing low resolution on peripheral blood samples in order to ensure
accurate, reliable, and reproducible results.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory staff performing HLA Class I
disease association typing in the laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of designated laboratory personnel to perform
and document HLA typing according to this protocol.
4. DEFINITIONS
HLA antigens refer to the antigens of the major histocompatibility
complex (MHC) that are involved in the immune system's recognition
of self versus non-self. Low resolution typing provides broad antigen-
level identification of HLA alleles.
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type: Peripheral blood
• Collection Tubes: ACD (yellow top) or EDTA (purple top) tubes.
• Volume: Minimum 5 mL of whole blood.
• Stability: Blood samples should be kept at room temperature and
processed within 24 hours of collection. Samples may be
refrigerated at 2-8°C if processing is delayed, but should not
exceed 48 hours.
6. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• DNA extraction kit: Obtain manufacturer's guidelines for use.
• Taq polymerase and PCR reagents.
• Sequence-specific oligonucleotide probes (SSO).
• Thermal cycler (PCR machine).
• Electrophoresis system with gel documentation equipment.
• DNA quantification system.
• Personal protective equipment (PPE).
7. PROCEDURE
1. DNA Extraction:
◦ Follow the manufacturer's instructions for the DNA
extraction kit.
◦ Extract DNA from 5 mL of whole blood.
◦ Quantify the DNA concentration and ensure it is within the
acceptable range (20-50 ng/μL).
2. PCR Amplification:
◦ Prepare PCR master mix as per manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Prepare PCR reaction: Add DNA template, primers for HLA-
A, -B, -C, nucleotides, Taq polymerase, and buffer.
◦ Mix well and aliquot into PCR tubes.
◦ Use the following PCR cycling conditions:
▪ Initial denaturation at 95°C for 3 minutes.
▪ 35 cycles of:
▪ Denaturation at 94°C for 30 seconds.
▪ Annealing at 60°C for 30 seconds.
▪ Extension at 72°C for 1 minute.
▪ Final extension at 72°C for 10 minutes.
◦ Store PCR products at 4°C until further analysis.
3. Hybridization with Sequence-Specific Oligonucleotides
(SSO):
◦ Denature PCR product by heating to 95°C for 5 minutes and
immediately cooling on ice.
◦ Hybridize PCR products with SSO probes specific for HLA-
A, -B, and -C loci.
◦ Follow the hybridization protocol as per the manufacturer’s
instructions, including washing steps.
4. Detection:
◦ Detect bound probes using colorimetric or fluorescence
detection systems as specified by the SSO typing kit
manufacturer.
◦ Record results.
5. Electrophoresis:
◦ Prepare an agarose gel for electrophoresis.
◦ Load PCR products and run electrophoresis at 100V for
approximately 30-45 minutes.
◦ Visualize the bands under UV light and document the gel
images.
6. Result Analysis:
◦ Compare the hybridization patterns to the reference panel
provided by the kit manufacturer.
◦ Assign HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C types based on the
observed hybridization patterns.
◦ Document and verify results. All results should be reviewed
for accuracy by a second qualified technologist.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include positive and negative controls in each batch to ensure
assay performance.
• Maintain a log of all controls and document any deviations and
corrective actions taken.
• Perform routine maintenance and calibration of equipment per
manufacturer guidelines.
• Participate in external proficiency testing to ensure test accuracy
and reliability.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS) for
review.
• Verify that all data entered matches the laboratory records.
• Ensure that any critical findings are reported promptly to the
requesting physician.
