Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Human Leukocyte
Antigens (HLA) Class I and II Disease Association Typing, Low
Resolution, Blood
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the procedures to be followed for the analytical
phase of generating results for HLA Class I and II Disease
Association Typing, low resolution from blood samples in a CLIA-
certified laboratory. It includes steps for specimen preparation, PCR
amplification, typing by sequence-specific oligonucleotide (SSO)
probes, data interpretation, and reporting.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel involved in the HLA
typing process.
3. RESPONSIBILITIES
• Laboratory Technologists: Responsible for performing the
typing procedure accurately and recording all necessary data.
• Laboratory Supervisors: Ensure compliance with this SOP and
provide oversight.
• Quality Assurance: Perform regular reviews and validation of the
procedures and results.
4. DEFINITIONS
• HLA Typing: Determining specific variations of human leukocyte
antigens.
• Low Resolution Typing: Identifying alleles and groups of HLA
without distinguishing between all pairs of alleles within a group.
5. SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS
• Follow all laboratory safety protocols including the use of PPE
(personal protective equipment).
• Handle all blood samples with appropriate precautions to avoid
exposure to bloodborne pathogens.
6. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• PCR Workstation
• Thermal Cycler
• Gel Electrophoresis Equipment
• DNA Extraction Kits
• HLA Typing Kits (low resolution)
• Sequence-Specific Oligonucleotide (SSO) Probes
• Pipettes and Tips
• Nuclease-free Tubes
• Reagents for PCR (primers, dNTPs, Taq polymerase, buffers)
• Ethanol, Isopropanol, PBS, Lysis Buffer
• Laboratory Grade Water
7. PROCEDURE
7.1 DNA Extraction
1.1. Ensure the blood sample has been accessioned and
appropriately labeled. 1.2. Use a DNA extraction kit following the
manufacturer’s instructions to isolate genomic DNA from the blood
sample. 1.3. Quantitate the extracted DNA using a
spectrophotometer. Ensure the DNA concentration is within the
required range (e.g., 20-50 ng/µL).
7.2 PCR Amplification
2.1. Prepare the PCR master mix according to the HLA typing kit
instructions including buffer, dNTPs, primers, Taq polymerase, and
nuclease-free water. 2.2. Dispense the master mix into PCR tubes
and add the extracted DNA. 2.3. Load the tubes into the thermal
cycler and run the PCR program as specified by the HLA typing kit.
2.4. After amplification, confirm PCR success by running an aliquot of
the product on an agarose gel and visualizing under UV light.
7.3 HLA Typing
3.1. Hybridize the PCR amplicons with sequence-specific
oligonucleotide (SSO) probes. 3.2. Follow the protocols provided in
the HLA typing kit for hybridization and washing steps. 3.3. Detect
hybridized probes using a detection system such as flow cytometry or
a luminometer as specified by the kit.
7.4 Data Interpretation
4.1. Use the provided software to analyze the signal intensities
corresponding to different SSO probes. 4.2. Determine the HLA types
by comparing the signals to the reference database available in the
software. Low resolution results in broad allele groups being
reported.
7.5 Quality Control
5.1. Include positive and negative controls in each run to ensure the
accuracy and reliability of the test results. 5.2. Record all control
values and verify that they are within acceptable limits before
proceeding with the analysis of patient samples. 5.3. If controls fail,
troubleshoot and repeat the analysis.
7.6 Reporting Results
6.1. Double-check all entries and interpretations of the HLA typing
results. 6.2. Document and report the HLA types in the laboratory
information system (LIS). 6.3. Print and sign the final report, ensuring
it includes patient identifiers, HLA Class I and II results, and
comments on the resolution level.
