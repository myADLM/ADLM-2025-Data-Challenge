Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) for HUMAN
PAPILLOMAVIRUS (HPV) DETECTION AND HIGH-RISK
GENOTYPING, SELF-COLLECT, PCR, VAGINAL
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the steps and processes
involved in the analytical phase of generating results for Human
Papillomavirus (HPV) detection and high-risk genotyping using PCR
on self-collected vaginal samples.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel involved in the
processing and analysis of self-collected vaginal samples for HPV
detection and high-risk genotyping using PCR.
3. RESPONSIBILITIES
• It is the responsibility of all trained laboratory personnel to follow
this SOP to ensure the accuracy and reliability of HPV PCR test
results.
• The supervisor is responsible for ensuring all staff are adequately
trained in this procedure and that quality control (QC) measures
are followed.
4. MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT
• PCR instrumentation and software
• Sterile collection tubes/vials for self-collected vaginal specimens
• DNA extraction kits
• HPV PCR assay kits
• PCR reagents and consumables
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Centrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Microcentrifuge tubes
• Nuclease-free water
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
5. SPECIMEN
Preferred/Acceptable Specimens:
• Self-collected vaginal swabs placed in sterile transport media/
tubes, labeled with patient identifiers.
• Specimens should be received in the lab within 72 hours of
collection and stored at 2-8°C until processing.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens received without proper labeling or patient identifiers.
• Specimens received beyond 72 hours post-collection without prior
refrigeration.
• Specimens that show evidence of leakage or improper handling.
6. PROCEDURE
A. DNA Extraction
1. Upon receipt, verify specimen integrity and labeling. Log the
specimen information into the laboratory information system
(LIS).
2. Vortex the specimen tube briefly to homogenize contents.
3. Transfer 200 µL of the specimen to a labeled microcentrifuge
tube.
4. Follow the DNA extraction kit protocol to isolate DNA from the
specimen.
5. Elute the DNA in 50-100 µL of elution buffer provided in the kit.
6. Store the extracted DNA at 2-8°C until PCR analysis.
B. PCR Amplification
1. Prepare the PCR master mix according to the manufacturer's
instructions included in the HPV PCR assay kit, ensuring all
reagents are thawed and mixed thoroughly.
2. Label PCR tubes or 96-well plates according to specimen
identifiers.
3. Add 5 µL of extracted DNA to each tube/well containing 20 µL
of PCR master mix.
4. Include positive and negative controls in each PCR run to
validate results.
5. Seal the tubes/plate and briefly centrifuge to ensure contents
are at the bottom.
6. Set up the PCR instrument with the following cycling
parameters:
◦ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 10 minutes
◦ Denaturation: 95°C for 15 seconds
◦ Annealing/Extension: 60°C for 1 minute
◦ Number of cycles: 45
C. Detection and Genotyping
1. Once the PCR run is complete, analyze the amplified products
using the PCR instrument software.
2. Interpret the presence or absence of high-risk HPV genotypes
based on the fluorescent signals and threshold values provided
by the manufacturer.
3. Record the findings in the LIS, ensuring all controls have
performed within expected parameters.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include internal controls in each extraction and amplification batch
to monitor DNA recovery and PCR efficiency.
• Run external quality assurance samples periodically to ensure
assay performance.
• Follow manufacturer's guidelines for control and validation
requirements.
• Document all QC results and review them before reporting patient
results.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results should be verified by the technologist before being
finalized in the LIS.
• Report results as "HPV detected" with specific high-risk
genotypes, or "HPV not detected".
• Note any issues or unusual findings in the report and follow up as
needed.
9. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Positive: Presence of high-risk HPV genotypes.
• Negative: Absence of high-risk HPV genotypes.
10. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to the manufacturer's assay kit insert for limitations in
detection and genotyping scope.
• Ensure adherence to specified conditions to avoid false results.
