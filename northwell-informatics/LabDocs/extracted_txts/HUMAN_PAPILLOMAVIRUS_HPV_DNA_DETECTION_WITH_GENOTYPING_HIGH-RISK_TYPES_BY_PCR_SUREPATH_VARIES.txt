Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Human Papillomavirus (HPV)
DNA Detection with Genotyping for High-Risk Types by PCR,
SurePath, Varies
1. PURPOSE This procedure outlines the steps required for the
detection and genotyping of high-risk Human Papillomavirus
(HPV) DNA in cervical specimens collected in SurePath
preservative solution using Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)
technology.
2. SPECIMEN
• Specimen type: Cervical specimens collected in SurePath
solution.
• Storage: Store specimens at 2-8°C until processing. Specimens
should be tested within 2 weeks of collection.
• Unacceptable specimens: Specimens that are not within the
specified collection, storage, or transportation guidelines, or have
insufficient volume.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Nucleic acid extraction kit (specific to the laboratory’s
instrumentation)
• PCR assay kit and reagents specific for the detection of high-risk
HPV types
• SurePath preservative solution (manufacturer-approved)
• PCR instrument and required consumables
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
• Pipettes and sterile pipette tips
• Vibratory homogenizer for sample preparation (optional but
recommended)
• DNA decontamination reagents (e.g., DNA Away)
1. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation
1. Mix the SurePath specimen thoroughly to ensure homogeneity.
2. Transfer 1 mL of the specimen to a labeled microcentrifuge
tube.
3. Centrifuge the specimen at 13,000 rpm for 10 minutes to pellet
the cells.
4. Carefully remove the supernatant without disturbing the pellet.
5. Resuspend the cell pellet in 200 µL Nuclease-Free Water or
appropriate lysis buffer.
B. Nucleic Acid Extraction
1. Follow the manufacturer's protocol for the nucleic acid
extraction kit.
2. Elute the DNA in the recommended volume of elution buffer
(typically 50-100 µL).
3. Store the extracted DNA at -20°C until ready for PCR
amplification.
C. PCR Amplification
1. Prepare the PCR master mix according to the kit's instructions.
Include reagents such as primers, nucleotides, polymerase,
and other necessary buffers.
2. Add the appropriate volume of extracted DNA (5-10 µL) to each
PCR reaction tube.
3. Include positive and negative controls in each PCR run.
4. Load the prepared PCR tubes/plates onto the PCR instrument.
5. Program the PCR instrument with the appropriate cycling
conditions, typically:
◦ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 10 minutes
◦ 35-40 cycles of:
▪ Denaturation: 95°C for 30 seconds
▪ Annealing: 55-60°C for 30 seconds
▪ Extension: 72°C for 1 minute
◦ Final extension: 72°C for 10 minutes
D. Detection and Genotyping
1. After amplification, analyze the PCR products using the
recommended detection method (e.g., gel electrophoresis, real-
time PCR detection systems, or hybridization).
2. For genotyping, follow the manufacturer's instructions for
identifying high-risk HPV types through specific probes or
melting curve analysis.
E. Quality Control
1. Include internal controls to confirm DNA quality and reaction
efficiency.
2. Ensure positive controls appropriately amplify the correct HPV
DNA types.
3. Verify that negative controls show no amplification, indicating
no contamination.
4. REPORTING RESULTS
• Record and document the outcomes of the PCR reactions.
• Report positive results as the presence of high-risk HPV types
and specify the genotype.
• Report negative results as no high-risk HPV DNA detected.
• Intermediates or indeterminate results should be repeated or
evaluated further based on laboratory policy.
1. INTERPRETATION GUIDELINES
• Positive: Amplification of HPV DNA specific to high-risk
genotypes.
• Negative: No amplification of HPV DNA.
• Indeterminate: Failed controls, unclear results that require
additional assessment.
