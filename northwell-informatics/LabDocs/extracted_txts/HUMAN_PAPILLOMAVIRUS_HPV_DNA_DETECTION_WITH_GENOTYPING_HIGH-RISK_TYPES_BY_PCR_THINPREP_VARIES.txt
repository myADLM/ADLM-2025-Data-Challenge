Standard Operating Procedure for Human Papillomavirus (HPV)
DNA Detection with Genotyping, High-risk Types by PCR,
ThinPrep, Varies
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is to
outline the protocol for the analytical phase of generating results for
Human Papillomavirus (HPV) DNA detection with genotyping for
high-risk types using Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)
methodology on ThinPrep specimens.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all designated laboratory personnel to
perform the analysis as described in this SOP and ensure that all
pertinent information is accurately recorded.
• Analytical technologist: Responsible for performing the HPV
DNA testing and recording results.
• Quality control staff: Ensure that all quality control procedures
are followed and documented.
• Supervisor: Oversee the analytical process and ensure
adherence to the protocol.
3. DEFINITIONS
HPV DNA Detection: A molecular method used to identify the
presence of high-risk HPV genotypes by amplifying target DNA
sequences.
Genotyping: The process of determining the specific HPV genotypes
present in the sample.
ThinPrep: A cytology preparation method where cells from a sample
are spread evenly on a microscope slide for analysis.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type: ThinPrep Pap specimens.
Specimen Stability: Specimens should be stored refrigerated at
2-8°C if not processed immediately. Do not freeze.
Specimen Rejection Criteria:
• Specimens not received in ThinPrep medium.
• Specimens with no identification.
• Specimens with insufficient volume.
• Specimens received leaking or broken.
• Specimens received not meeting storage conditions (e.g., frozen).
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• PCR thermal cycler
• DNA extraction kit
• HPV genotyping kit
• ThinPrep sample preparation equipment
• Microcentrifuges
• Pipettes and tips
• Nuclease-free water
• Gloves and other personal protective equipment (PPE)
6. PROCEDURE
A. DNA Extraction:
1. Vortex the ThinPrep vial to resuspend the cellular material.
2. Transfer a specified volume of the ThinPrep sample to a
labeled microcentrifuge tube.
3. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for the DNA extraction kit
for cell lysis, DNA binding, washing, and elution steps.
4. Store extracted DNA at 2-8°C if not used immediately.
B. PCR Amplification:
1. Prepare the PCR master mix according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
2. Add the appropriate volume of extracted DNA to each PCR
tube or well.
3. Include positive controls (known HPV positive samples) and
negative controls (nuclease-free water) in each run.
4. Program the thermal cycler with the cycling conditions as per
the HPV genotyping kit instructions. Typical PCR conditions
may include:
◦ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 10 minutes
◦ Denaturation: 95°C for 30 seconds
◦ Annealing: 55°C for 30 seconds
◦ Extension: 72°C for 1 minute
◦ Final extension: 72°C for 10 minutes
◦ Hold: 4°C
C. Detection and Genotyping:
1. Post PCR, separate the PCR product using appropriate
techniques such as electrophoresis or real-time detection
depending on the genotyping kit instructions.
2. Determine the presence and type of HPV by comparing the
PCR product bands or signals to those of the controls.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Run internal quality controls with each batch of tests, including
positive and negative controls.
2. Ensure that all equipment is calibrated and maintained
according to manufacturer’s guidelines.
3. Document and review all control results to ensure they meet the
predefined acceptance criteria.
4. If controls do not meet criteria, identify and correct the problem
before reporting patient results.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Transcribe the result data from the detection system into the
Laboratory Information System (LIS).
2. Check for any discrepancies or errors in the PCR results.
3. Flag any abnormal or critical results for further review.
4. Ensure that final results are reviewed and verified by a
designated laboratory supervisor before releasing.
9. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
• Negative for HPV: No DNA bands or signals detected
corresponding to high-risk HPV types.
• Positive for HPV: Presence of DNA bands or signals detected
corresponding to specific high-risk HPV types.
• Genotyping: Specific HPV genotypes identified based on the PCR
product profiles.

11. REVISION HISTORY
• Date: New SOP drafted.
• Next Review: Scheduled for periodic review and update in one
year or as necessary.
This protocol must be followed meticulously to ensure accurate and
reliable results for HPV DNA detection and genotyping. All deviations
must be documented and reported for review.
