Standard Operating Procedures for Human Papillomavirus
(HPV) DNA Detection and Genotyping, High-Risk Types by PCR
with Papanicolaou Smear Reflex
1. PURPOSE
To provide standardized procedures for the detection and genotyping
of high-risk Human Papillomavirus (HPV) types utilizing Polymerase
Chain Reaction (PCR) testing. This procedure includes reflex testing
with Papanicolaou smear using ThinPrep® technology.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
Qualified laboratory personnel trained in molecular diagnostics and
cytology must perform each step of the procedure. It is the
responsibility of the lab staff to follow the protocol strictly, record all
necessary data accurately, ensure the integrity of the samples, and
report any issues to the supervisor.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type:
• Cervical cells collected in PreservCyt® Solution (ThinPrep®
vials).
Specimen Volume:
• Minimum of 20 mL in the ThinPrep® vial.
Specimen Stability:
• Room Temperature: stable for up to 3 weeks
• Refrigerated: not preferred
Unacceptable Conditions:
• Samples not collected in the PreservCyt® Solution.
• Insufficient volume.
• Samples with leakage.
• Specimens exceeding the stability time frame.
4. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
Equipment:
• PCR-DNA Analyzer
• Centrifuge
• Micropipettes
• Thermal cycler
• ThinPrep® Processor
• Microscope
Reagents and Supplies:
• DNA Extraction Kits
• High-Risk HPV PCR Kits
• ThinPrep® reagents
• Positive and Negative Controls
• Papanicolaou Staining Kits
5. PROCEDURE
A. DNA Extraction:
1. Preparation:
◦ Ensure all samples are properly labeled and recorded in the
system.
◦ Prepare workspace with necessary PPE and disinfectants.
2. Extraction:
◦ Vortex sample container and aliquot 5 mL of the sample into
a DNA extraction tube.
◦ Follow the DNA extraction kit protocol. Typical steps include
lysis, binding, washing, and elution of DNA.
◦ Quantify and assess the quality of extracted DNA using a
Nanodrop spectrophotometer.
B. PCR Amplification:
1. Setup:
◦ Prepare PCR master mix according to the high-risk HPV
PCR kit instructions.
◦ Aliquot master mix into PCR tubes or plates.
2. Amplification:
◦ Add extracted DNA to each PCR tube.
◦ Include positive and negative controls in each run.
◦ Run the thermal cycler according to the PCR kit’s cycling
conditions (denaturation, annealing, extension).
3. Detection and Genotyping:
◦ Use appropriate software or detection systems to identify
amplified HPV DNA.
◦ Match amplicon results to known high-risk HPV types for
genotyping.
C. Reflex Papanicolaou Smear:
1. ThinPrep Slide Preparation:
◦ Process remaining PreservCyt® sample using ThinPrep®
Processor to prepare the slide.
◦ Stain the slides using the Papanicolaou Staining Kit
according to manufacturer instructions.
2. Microscopic Examination:
◦ Examine slides under the microscope to assess cell
morphology and any potential dysplastic changes.
◦ Document cytological findings in the patient’s record.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
DNA Extraction and PCR:
• Include positive and negative controls in each batch.
• Perform regular calibration and maintenance on all equipment as
per manufacturer guidelines.
Papanicolaou Smear:
• Use known cytology standards and control slides to ensure
staining quality.
• Document and review all quality control results with a supervisor.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
• Review and verify all PCR and cytology results.
• Report findings through the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Reflex testing results should be linked to initial HPV PCR results.
• Critical findings and unusual patterns should be communicated
directly to the referring physician.
8. LIMITATIONS
• False negatives may result from insufficient cell samples or poor
DNA integrity.
• Contaminants or inhibitors could lead to false positives or
inadequate PCR amplification.
• Morphological changes detected via cytology may require further
investigation.

Implement the above procedures to ensure the accurate and efficient
detection of high-risk HPV types and necessary reflex cytology
assessment. Regular training and competency assessments for all
lab personnel involved in this protocol must be maintained and
documented.
