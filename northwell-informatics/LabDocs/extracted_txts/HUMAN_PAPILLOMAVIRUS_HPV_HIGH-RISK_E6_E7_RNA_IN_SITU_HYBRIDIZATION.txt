Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Human Papillomavirus (HPV) High-Risk
E6/E7, RNA In Situ Hybridization
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the procedures for the analytical phase in
generating results for Human Papillomavirus (HPV) High-Risk E6/E7,
RNA In Situ Hybridization (RNA ISH) in a CLIA-certified laboratory.
The aim is to ensure accurate and reliable detection of HPV E6/E7
mRNA expression in clinical specimens.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated trained laboratory personnel are responsible for
performing and documenting all steps in this procedure. The
laboratory supervisor is responsible for ensuring compliance with this
SOP and addressing any issues that arise during the analytical
phase.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Collection: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE)
tissue sections.
Specimen Handling:
• Ensure tissue blocks or slides are labeled with the patient
identifier and case number.
• Cut 4-5µm thick sections and place on positively charged slides.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• High-risk HPV RNA ISH probe set (commercial manufacturer)
• RNA ISH detection kit
• Positive control slides
• Hybridization oven
• Humidifying chambers
• Coverslips
• Microscopy slides
• Xylene
• Ethanol (100%, 95%, 70%)
• Wash buffers (provided in detection kit)
• Protease solution (if required)
• Hybridization buffer
• Counterstain (e.g., hematoxylin)
• Mounting medium
5. PROCEDURE
5.1 Pre-Analytical Preparation
1. Ensure all reagents, detection kits, and controls are within their
expiration dates.
2. Preheat the hybridization oven to the temperature
recommended by the probe manufacturer.
5.2 Specimen Preparation
1. Deparaffinization:
◦ Place FFPE slides in xylene for 2 x 5 min.
◦ Rehydrate slides through a graded ethanol series (100%,
95%, 70%) for 3 min each.
◦ Rinse slides in distilled water.
2. Protease Treatment (if applicable):
◦ Treat slides with prewarmed protease solution for the
specified time.
◦ Rinse slides with wash buffer.
5.3 Hybridization
1. Apply probe:
◦ Apply 20-25 µl of HPV RNA ISH probe to each tissue
section. Avoid bubbles.
◦ Cover with coverslip.
2. Hybridization:
◦ Place slides in a humidifying chamber and incubate in the
preheated hybridization oven.
◦ Heat at the specific temperature for the recommended
duration.
5.4 Post-Hybridization Wash
1. Remove coverslips carefully.
2. Wash slides with wash buffer to remove non-specific bindings.
◦ Follow manufacturer’s recommended washing steps and
durations.
5.5 Detection
1. Apply detection reagents according to the kit protocol.
2. Incubate slides with detection reagents for specified times.
3. Wash in between steps, as recommended.
4. Counterstain the tissue sections with hematoxylin (or other
specified counterstain).
5. Rinse slides in distilled water.
6. Dehydrate slides through graded ethanol (70%, 95%, 100%).
7. Clear slides in xylene.
5.6 Mounting
1. Apply mounting medium and cover with coverslip.
2. Allow slides to dry completely.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run a known positive control with each batch of specimens.
• Include a negative control by omitting the RNA probe on one test
slide per batch.
• Document all quality control results. Any deviation from expected
results must be investigated and resolved before reporting patient
results.
7. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
1. Examine slides under a bright-field microscope.
2. Evaluate staining intensity and pattern in both the patient
sample and control slides.
3. Positive Results: Presence of dark punctate staining within the
nuclear space indicates HPV E6/E7 mRNA expression.
4. Negative Results: Absence of punctate staining or background
staining only.
5. Record findings and ensure correlation with clinical information
for accurate diagnosis.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Report results according to laboratory reporting guidelines.
• Ensure results are reviewed and verified by a qualified pathologist
or designated technologist before release.
9. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s Instruction Manual for HPV RNA ISH Probe Set
and Detection Kit.

10. MODIFICATIONS
• Any deviations or modifications to this procedure must be
approved by the laboratory director and documented
appropriately.
