Standard Operating Procedure
Title: Analytical Phase of Generating Results for Human
Papillomavirus (HPV) High/Low Risk, In Situ Hybridization
Effective Date: [Insert Date] Review Date: [Insert Date] Version:
1.0
1. Purpose:
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the analytical protocol for
detecting and generating results for Human Papillomavirus (HPV)
High/Low Risk using In Situ Hybridization (ISH). This procedure
ensures reliable identification of HPV DNA in tissue samples and
categorizes the viral risk levels.
1. Scope:
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel involved in the
analytical process of HPV identification through ISH. The specimen
has already been collected, received, and accessioned.
1. Responsibilities:
It is the responsibility of:
• The laboratory technologists to follow the outlined protocol
precisely.
• The supervisor to ensure adherence to this SOP and handle any
procedural deviations.
• The quality control officer to validate results against established
controls and standards.
1. Materials and Equipment:
• Pre-treated slides with tissue sections
• HPV High/Low Risk-specific probes
• Hybridization buffer
• Wash buffers
• Detection reagents (e.g., streptavidin-HRP, DAB solution)
• Counterstain (e.g., hematoxylin)
• Positive and negative control slides
• Humidity chamber or hybridization oven
• Microscope
• Temperature-controlled incubation devices
1. Procedure:
5.1 Preparation:
• Set up all required reagents and equipment.
• Retrieve the pre-treated slide(s) with tissue section(s) and label
appropriately.
5.2 Hybridization:
• Pre-warm the hybridization buffer to room temperature.
• Apply HPV High/Low Risk-specific probes to the tissue sections.
• Place slides in a humidity chamber or hybridization oven for
hybridization at appropriate temperatures (usually 37°C) for the
recommended duration (typically 2 hours).
5.3 Post-hybridization washes:
• Remove slides from the hybridization chamber.
• Wash slides in a series of wash buffers following established time
intervals and temperatures (usually room temperature to 42°C).
5.4 Detection:
• Apply streptavidin-HRP or other detection reagent to the slides.
• Incubate according to the manufacturer’s instructions (usually 30
minutes at room temperature).
• Rinse the slides in wash buffer.
5.5 Visualization:
• Apply DAB solution to each slide until the desired signal strength
is achieved (typically 5-10 minutes).
• Stop the reaction with water and counterstain with hematoxylin.
• Rinse slides and mount with a cover slip.
5.6 Microscopic Analysis:
• Examine slides under the microscope.
• Compare staining pattern with positive and negative controls.
• Categorize the result as HPV High Risk or Low Risk based on the
presence and intensity of signal.
1. Quality Control:
• Run positive and negative controls along with patient samples
each time the assay is performed.
• Record control results to ensure no procedural contamination or
errors.
• Investigate and rectify any unexpected control results before
reporting patient data.
1. Reporting Results:
• Document observations in the laboratory information system
(LIS).
• Review and verify results by an experienced technologist.
• Include a result comment stating the risk level and quality
indicator where applicable.
