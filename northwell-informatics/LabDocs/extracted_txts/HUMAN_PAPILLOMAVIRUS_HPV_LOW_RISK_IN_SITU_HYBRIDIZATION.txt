Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for In Situ Hybridization of
Low-Risk Human Papillomavirus (HPV)
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedure for generating
results of Human Papillomavirus (HPV) low-risk typing using in situ
hybridization (ISH). The protocol aims to ensure consistent and
accurate identification and typing of low-risk HPV in clinical
specimens.
Responsibility:
All trained laboratory personnel are responsible for performing this
procedure as detailed in this SOP. Supervisors are responsible for
ensuring adherence to the protocol and handling any deviations from
standard practice.
2. DEFINITION
Human Papillomavirus (HPV) low-risk types include, but are not
limited to, HPV types 6 and 11. The ISH technique involves the
hybridization of a labeled DNA or RNA probe to HPV target
sequences within tissue sections or cells to visualize the presence of
HPV in the specimen.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Acceptable Specimen Types:
• Cervical biopsies
• Tissue sections fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin and
embedded in paraffin
• Cytological specimens fixed in alcohol or a commercial fixative
Unacceptable Specimen Types:
• Specimens not fixed properly, exhibiting autolysis or extreme
drying
• Specimens from non-human sources
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• In situ hybridization oven/incubator
• Adequate ventilation hood and clean workspace
• Microscope equipped for brightfield and fluorescence
• HPV low-risk specific probe (commercially available, per
manufacturer's instructions)
• Enzymatic and/or heat-induced epitope retrieval solutions
• Detection kits including chromogenic or fluorescent labels
• Slides, coverslips, and related mounting media
• Positive and negative control tissues
• Buffers and solutions (e.g., SSC, Proteinase K, blocking reagents)
• Pure water (e.g., Milli-Q or equivalent)
5. PROCEDURE
A) PREPARATION OF TISSUE SECTIONS/CELLS:
1. Deparaffinize formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue
sections using xylene (3 x 5 minutes) followed by rehydration
through graded ethanol series to water.
2. For cytological specimens, fix cells in alcohol or specialized
fixative and place on slides.
B) ANTIGEN RETRIEVAL:
1. Perform target retrieval (e.g., heat-induced epitope retrieval in
citrate buffer or enzymatic digestion with Proteinase K) as per
the protocol specified by the probe manufacturer.
C) PROBE HYBRIDIZATION:
1. Pre-warm hybridization chamber to 37°C.
2. Apply HPV low-risk specific probe to the sections or cells
following manufacturer's instructions.
3. Cover sections with coverslips to prevent evaporation. Incubate
in hybridization chamber for specified time (usually overnight at
37°C).
D) POST-HYBRIDIZATION WASHES:
1. Wash slides in pre-warmed washes (e.g., SSC buffers at
varying stringency) to remove non-specifically bound probe.
E) DETECTION:
1. Apply detection reagents as per the detection kit instructions.
Chromogenic or fluorescence signals are to be utilized as per
setup in your laboratory.
F) COUNTERSTAINING:
1. Counterstain slides appropriately (e.g., hematoxylin for
chromogenic detection; DAPI for fluorescent detection).
G) MOUNTING:
1. Mount and coverslip slides using appropriate media.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
• Examine stained slides under the microscope.
• Look for staining patterns indicative of HPV low-risk types
(specific chromogenic signal or fluorescence localization).
• Document findings, noting the presence or absence of HPV low-
risk types, morphological context, and areas of staining.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include positive control tissue known to have HPV low-risk types.
• Include negative control tissue (HPV-negative).
• Ensure reagents are within expiry dates and stored per
manufacturer's instructions.
• Document all steps, including deviations from SOP.
8. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Not applicable. Results are qualitative based on presence/absence
and distribution of staining.
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Potential cross-reactivity with other HPV types. Ensure probe
specificity.
• False negatives may occur due to insufficient tissue preparation
or probe hybridization issues.
10. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's insert for HPV low-risk probe
• In situ hybridization technique manuals
• Peer-reviewed articles relevant to HPV ISH
11. DOCUMENTATION
Ensure SOP version control and review dates are documented.
Maintain appropriate documentation for specimen tracking, quality
control, and result reporting.
12. SAFETY AND COMPLIANCE
• Adhere to biohazard safety protocols in handling specimen and
reagents.
• Comply with CLIA regulations and other relevant guidelines.
