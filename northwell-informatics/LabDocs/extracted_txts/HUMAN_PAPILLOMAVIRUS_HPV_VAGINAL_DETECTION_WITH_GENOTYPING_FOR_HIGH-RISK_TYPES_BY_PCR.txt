Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Human Papillomavirus
(HPV) Vaginal Detection with Genotyping for High-Risk Types by
PCR
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the procedures for detecting Human
Papillomavirus (HPV) DNA in vaginal specimens using Polymerase
Chain Reaction (PCR) and genotyping for high-risk HPV types. This
test is conducted to identify the presence of HPV and associated
high-risk genotypes which may lead to cervical cancer or other HPV-
related diseases.
2. SCOPE
This protocol is applicable to all laboratory personnel performing HPV
detection and genotyping using PCR in the laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the laboratory staff to:
• Ensure proper handling and preparation of specimens.
• Perform the PCR and genotyping as per the outlined procedures.
• Document and report the results accurately.
• Follow Quality Control (QC) measures and take corrective actions
if necessary.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Types:
• Preferred: Vaginal swab specimens collected in a suitable
transport medium.
• Acceptable: Cervical swabs may also be used if specified by the
provider.
Specimen Handling:
• Specimens must be transported to the laboratory within 24 hours
of collection.
• If there is a delay in transportation, specimens should be stored at
2-8°C and tested within 48 hours.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens not labeled with patient identification details.
• Specimens leaking or collected in inappropriate transport media.
• Specimens stored beyond the acceptable time frame.
5. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
Equipment:
• PCR thermal cycler
• Laminar flow hood
• Micropipettes and tips
• Vortex mixer and centrifuge
Reagents:
• DNA extraction kit
• Master mix for PCR
• Primers and probes specific for high-risk HPV genotypes
• Positive and negative controls for PCR
• Nuclease-free water
6. PROCEDURE
Specimen Preparation:
1. Vortex the specimen for 15 seconds.
2. Centrifuge the specimen at 5000 RPM for 5 minutes.
3. Using the DNA extraction kit, extract DNA from the specimen
following the manufacturer’s instructions.
4. Elute the DNA into 50 μL of elution buffer.
PCR Setup:
1. Prepare the PCR master mix according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
◦ Example: 25 μL of master mix, 5 μL of extracted DNA, and
20 μL of nuclease-free water per sample.
2. Aliquot the master mix into PCR tubes or a PCR plate.
3. Add 5 μL of extracted DNA to each tube/plate.
Thermal Cycling Conditions:
1. Initial denaturation at 95°C for 10 minutes.
2. 40 cycles of:
◦ Denaturation at 95°C for 15 seconds,
◦ Annealing and extension at 60°C for 1 minute.
3. Final extension at 60°C for 5 minutes.
Genotyping:
1. Load the PCR product onto a high-resolution melt (HRM)
analysis platform.
2. Perform HRM analysis to differentiate HPV genotypes based on
the melting profiles.
3. Compare the melting profiles to reference standards to identify
high-risk HPV genotypes.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include a negative control (nuclease-free water) with each PCR
run to monitor for contamination.
• Include positive controls (known HPV positive samples) to ensure
the PCR reaction worked correctly.
• Monitor QC results and repeat the test if controls are out of the
expected range.
8. INTERPRETATION AND REPORTING OF RESULTS
• Positive Result: Detection of HPV DNA in the specimen, with
specific genotyping indicating the presence of high-risk types.
• Negative Result: No detection of HPV DNA.
• Include a “No result due to interference” comment if PCR fails
despite repeated attempts.
• Report results in the laboratory information system (LIS) and
ensure confirmation and verification by another technologist.
9. LIMITATIONS
• Specimen collection, handling, and storage conditions may affect
the accuracy of results.
• The presence of inhibitors in the specimen may cause PCR
failure.
• This assay is intended for use with vaginal/cervical specimens;
other specimen types may not be validated.
