Standard Operating Procedure for the Analytical Phase of
Human Placental Lactogen (hPL) Testing
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to outline the steps for the analytical
phase of testing Human Placental Lactogen (hPL) in serum samples,
ensuring accurate and reliable results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
Laboratory technologists are responsible for performing and
documenting the analysis of hPL according to this procedure. It is the
responsibility of the supervising scientist to ensure that all
technologists are adequately trained and competent in this
procedure.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND HANDLING
• Preferred specimen: 5 mL of serum collected in a red-top tube
without additives or gel separators.
• Acceptable specimens: Serum samples collected in SST (serum-
separating tubes) provided that serum is promptly separated post-
centrifugation.
• Unacceptable specimens: Specimens with significant hemolysis,
lipemia, or containing anticoagulants (e.g., EDTA, heparin).
Specimens must be stored at 2-8°C and analyzed within 48 hours of
collection. If longer storage is required, store specimens at -20°C or
below.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Human Placental Lactogen (hPL) assay kit (specify manufacturer
and catalog number)
• Calibrated micropipettes and tips
• Centrifuge
• Refrigerated storage 2-8°C
• Freezer storage ≤ -20°C
• Disposable gloves and appropriate PPE
• Timer
• Control materials: High, low, and normal control serums
5. PROCEDURE
5.1 Preparation
1. Ensure all required equipment, reagents, and supplies are
ready and properly calibrated.
2. Allow all reagents and control materials to come to room
temperature before use.
5.2 Assay Calibration
1. Prepare calibration standards as specified by the assay
manufacturer's instructions.
2. Pipette the required volumes of standards into appropriate
assay wells.
3. Run the calibrators as specified to establish the standard
curve.
5.3 Sample Preparation
1. Prepare sample aliquots if necessary. Each aliquot should
be free of particulates; centrifuge if required.
2. Pipette the required volume of sample into the designated
assay wells according to the manufacturer's instructions.
5.4 Quality Control
1. Run quality control samples (high, low, and normal)
alongside patient samples to ensure assay performance is
within acceptable limits. Record results in the QC log.
5.5 Assay Procedure
1. Follow the detailed steps provided in the manufacturer's
package insert to execute the assay: a. Addition of
reagents (e.g., capture antibodies, conjugates) b.
Incubation steps c. Washing steps d. Substrate addition e.
Reading absorbance or signal intensity using the
appropriate reader
5.6 Interpretation of Results
1. Plot the calibration curve using the absorbance or signal
values from the calibration standards.
2. Determine the concentration of hPL in patient samples by
extrapolating from the calibration curve.
3. Review QC data to ensure assay validity. If controls are out
of predetermined ranges, re-run the assay.
6. QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE
• Perform internal quality control checks with every batch of
samples processed.
• Conduct bi-weekly comparisons with known standards to
verify the precision and accuracy of the instrument.
• Run external proficiency testing samples as required.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Record patient results in the Laboratory Information
System (LIS) ensuring correct patient identification.
2. Verify all results against control samples and standard
curves before releasing.
3. Notify the attending physician of any critical or unexpected
results as per laboratory protocol.
8. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• hPL Reference Intervals:
◦ Refer to the manufacturer’s guidelines or established
laboratory-specific reference ranges based on population
studies.
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to the assay manufacturer’s insert for specific
limitations, including potential cross-reactivity, interferences,
and sensitivity limits.
