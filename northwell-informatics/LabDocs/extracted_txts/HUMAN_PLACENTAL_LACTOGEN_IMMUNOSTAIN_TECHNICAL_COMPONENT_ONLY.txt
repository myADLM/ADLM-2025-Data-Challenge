Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Human Placental Lactogen Immunostain - Technical
Component Only
Department: Histopathology
Effective Date: [Insert Date]
Review Date: [Insert Review Date]
Version: 1.0
PURPOSE: To provide a standardized procedure for the technical
component of performing Human Placental Lactogen (hPL)
immunostaining on histological tissue sections. This procedure
ensures consistent and reliable staining results for diagnostic
purposes.
RESPONSIBILITY: The histotechnologists are responsible for the
execution of this procedure, including preparation, staining, and
quality control processes. It is the responsibility of the laboratory
supervisor to ensure adherence to the protocol and to address any
technical issues that may arise.
DEFINITIONS:
• Human Placental Lactogen (hPL): A hormone produced by the
placenta, important for pregnancy and considered during the
evaluation of placental function and certain neoplasms.
• Immunostaining: A laboratory method used to detect specific
antigens in cells or tissue sections by utilizing antibodies tagged
with a visible label.
EQUIPMENT & REAGENTS:
• Microtome
• Water bath
• Humidified chamber
• Microscope slides and cover slips
• Positive control slides
• Primary antibody to human placental lactogen
• Secondary antibody reagents
• Detection system (e.g., HRP-conjugated secondary antibody with
DAB substrate)
• Appropriate blocking reagents
• Wash buffers (e.g., PBS or TBS)
• Mounting medium
PROCEDURE:
1. Preparation of Tissue Sections: a. Obtain formalin-fixed,
paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks. b. Cut 4-5 µm thick
sections using the microtome. c. Float sections on a water bath
at 40°C and mount them on charged microscope slides. d. Dry
sections at 60°C for 30-60 minutes or at room temperature
overnight.
2. Deparaffinization and Rehydration: a. Place slides in a series
of xylene baths (3 changes, 5 minutes each) to deparaffinize. b.
Rehydrate slides by passing them through decreasing
concentrations of ethanol (100%, 90%, 70%, and then distilled
water) for 3 minutes each.
3. Antigen Retrieval: a. Perform antigen retrieval using an
appropriate buffer (e.g., citrate buffer, pH 6.0) in a pressure
cooker, microwave, or water bath at 95-99°C for 20 minutes. b.
Allow slides to cool for 20 minutes at room temperature.
4. Blocking: a. Rinse slides in PBS or TBS. b. Block endogenous
peroxidase activity by incubating slides in 3% hydrogen
peroxide in methanol for 10 minutes. c. Rinse slides in PBS or
TBS. d. Apply a protein blocking solution (e.g., 10% normal
serum) for 10-20 minutes to reduce non-specific binding.
5. Primary Antibody Incubation: a. Incubate sections with the
primary antibody against hPL at the optimal dilution (as
determined by prior titration) for 60 minutes in a humidified
chamber. b. Rinse slides in PBS or TBS for 5 minutes, 3 times.
6. Secondary Antibody Incubation and Detection: a. Incubate
sections with an appropriate secondary antibody conjugated to
HRP for 20-30 minutes. b. Rinse slides in PBS or TBS for 5
minutes, 3 times. c. Apply the DAB substrate for 5-10 minutes
until the desired intensity is achieved. d. Rinse slides in distilled
water.
7. Counterstaining: a. Counterstain slides with hematoxylin for
1-2 minutes to provide contrast. b. Rinse slides in running tap
water for 5 minutes. c. Perform a final quick rinse in distilled
water.
8. Dehydration and Mounting: a. Dehydrate slides by passing
them through increasing concentrations of ethanol (70%, 90%,
100%) and then into xylene (3 changes, 5 minutes each). b.
Apply a cover slip using a suitable mounting medium.
9. Quality Control: a. Include a positive control slide with each
batch of staining to ensure proper staining reaction. b. Examine
slides under a microscope to ensure appropriate staining
intensity and specificity. c. Document the staining results,
including any deviations or issues.
REPORTING RESULTS:
• The technical component only involves staining and QC. It is the
responsibility of the pathologist to review and interpret the stained
sections.
• Ensure proper documentation and transfer of slides and test
results to the pathologist for diagnostic interpretation.
REFERENCE INTERVAL:
• Not applicable for the technical component.
REFERENCES:
• Manufacturer’s instructions for the primary and secondary
antibodies.
• Laboratory-specific immunohistochemical staining manuals.
Document Control: This SOP will be reviewed annually and updated
as necessary by the laboratory supervisor.
