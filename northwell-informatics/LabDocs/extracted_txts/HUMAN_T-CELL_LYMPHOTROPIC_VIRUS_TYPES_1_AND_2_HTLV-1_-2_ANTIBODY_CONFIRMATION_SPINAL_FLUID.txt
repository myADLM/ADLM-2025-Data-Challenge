Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Human T-Cell
Lymphotropic Virus Types 1 and 2 (HTLV-1/-2) Antibody
Confirmation, Spinal Fluid
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standard and reliable method for the confirmation of
antibodies against Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Types 1 and 2
(HTLV-1/-2) in spinal fluid specimens.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
• Designated Staff: Responsible for performing the antibody
confirmation test following this SOP.
• Supervisors: Ensure that testing is performed accurately and that
any discrepancies or issues are resolved promptly.
3. DEFINITIONS
• HTLV-1 and HTLV-2: Human T-cell lymphotropic viruses types 1
and 2, associated with adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma and other
diseases.
• Spinal Fluid (Cerebrospinal Fluid): The clear fluid found in the
brain and spinal cord.
4. PROCEDURE
4.1 Materials and Equipment
• Reagents:
◦ HTLV-1/-2 antibody confirmation kit (manufacturers per vendor
guidelines)
◦ Positive control: known positive HTLV-1/-2 antibody sample
◦ Negative control: HTLV-1/-2 negative sample
• Supplies:
◦ Spinal fluid collection tubes
◦ Micropipettes and tips (various volumes)
◦ Sterile gloves
◦ Centrifuge tubes
◦ Incubator
• Equipment:
◦ Microplate reader
◦ Incubator capable of maintaining 37°C
◦ Centrifuge
◦ Vortex mixer
4.2 Specimen Requirements
• Acceptable Specimen:
◦ Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) with sufficient volume (minimum 1
mL)
◦ Collected in sterile conditions and transported to the laboratory
immediately
• Unacceptable Specimen:
◦ Specimens with visible contamination
◦ Specimens with insufficient volume
4.3 Quality Control
• Run positive and negative controls with each batch of tests.
• Document the performance of controls and ensure they meet the
criteria before proceeding with patient samples.
• Record the date, time, and initials of the person running the QC.
4.4 Testing Procedure
Preparation
1. Logging and Preparation:
◦ Log the receipt of the specimen, recording the date, time,
and specimen condition.
◦ Label and aliquot samples if necessary.
◦ Centrifuge the spinal fluid at 1500 RPM for 10 minutes to
remove any particulates.
2. Reagent Preparation:
◦ Prepare reagents as per the manufacturer’s instructions,
ensuring all are at room temperature.
◦ Prepare antibody binding reaction mixtures according to kit
instructions.
Assay Procedure
1. Sample Addition:
◦ Using a micropipette, add the required volume of CSF,
positive control, and negative control to the designated wells
on the microplate.
◦ Mix well by gently tapping the sides of the microplate.
2. Incubation:
◦ Incubate the microplate at 37°C for 1 hour.
3. Washing:
◦ Wash the wells as instructed by the kit protocol to remove
unbound antibodies.
4. Detection:
◦ Add the enzyme-linked secondary antibodies to each well,
and incubate the plate as directed by the manufacturer’s
instructions.
◦ Wash the wells to remove excess secondary antibodies.
5. Substrate Addition:
◦ Add the enzyme substrate to the wells and allow a color
reaction to develop according to the kit protocol.
◦ Incubate under specified conditions (time and temperature)
undisturbed.
6. Stopping Reaction:
◦ Add the stopping solution to each well to halt the enzymatic
reaction.
7. Reading Results:
◦ Measure the optical density (OD) at the specified
wavelength using a microplate reader.
◦ Record the readings for each well including controls and
samples.
Interpretation
• Compare sample readings to the control readings.
• Positive result: Signal value above the cutoff as defined by the kit
instructions.
• Negative result: Signal below the cutoff.
• Equivocal: Values near the cutoff should be retested or, if
necessary, new samples should be requested for confirmation.
5. REPORTING RESULTS
• Document Results:
◦ Record all findings, including any anomalies or deviations from
expected outcomes.
• Report:
◦ Submit results for entry into the Laboratory Information
System (LIS) following verification by the technologist.
◦ Note equivocal results and recommend follow-up testing as
required.
6. TROUBLESHOOTING
• Troubleshooting Steps:
◦ If controls fail: Review the test process, reagents, and
equipment. Correct any issues before repeating the assay.
◦ For irregularities or unexpected results: Verify the integrity of
the samples, reagents and ensure procedural compliance.
Consult with supervisor before reanalysis.
