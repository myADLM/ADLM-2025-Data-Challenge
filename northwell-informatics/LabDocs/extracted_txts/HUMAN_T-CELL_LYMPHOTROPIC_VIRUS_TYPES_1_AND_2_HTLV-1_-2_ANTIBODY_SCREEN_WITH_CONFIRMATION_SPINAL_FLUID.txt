Standard Operating Procedure
Protocol for HTLV-1/-2 Antibody Screen with Confirmation in
Spinal Fluid
1. Purpose The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedure
for the detection of antibodies to HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 in human
spinal fluid through an initial screening test followed by
confirmation testing in the laboratory.
2. Scope This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel
conducting HTLV-1/-2 antibody screening and confirmation
testing on spinal fluid specimens.
3. Responsibilities
◦ Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for
performing the tests as described, ensuring accuracy,
precision, and timely reporting of results.
◦ The laboratory supervisor is responsible for reviewing and
validating the test results and ensuring any corrective
actions are taken when necessary.
4. Specimen Requirements and Handling
◦ Acceptable Specimens: Clear, non-hemolyzed spinal fluid
collected in sterile containers.
◦ Specimen Volume: Minimum of 1 mL of spinal fluid.
◦ Unacceptable Specimens: Hemolyzed, contaminated, or
insufficient volume of spinal fluid.
◦ Specimen Storage: The spinal fluid should be refrigerated if
not tested immediately (2-8°C). For long-term storage,
freeze at -20°C or lower.
5. Reagents and Supplies
◦ HTLV-1/-2 antibody screening kit (approved reagent kit, e.g.,
ELISA)
◦ HTLV-1/-2 confirmation kit (e.g., Western Blot)
◦ Sterile pipette tips, micropipettes, multichannel pipette
◦ Microplates, plate washers, and plate readers
◦ Appropriate controls: Positive and negative controls
specified by the manufacturer
◦ Documentation materials: Test requisition forms, SOP log
books
6. Procedure
A. Screening for HTLV-1/-2 Antibodies (e.g., ELISA)
1. Reagent Preparation
▪ Prepare all reagents, controls, and specimens as
directed by the kit manufacturer. Bring all reagents to
room temperature before use.
2. Sample Preparation
▪ Thaw frozen spinal fluid specimens and mix
thoroughly. Do not centrifuge samples more than
necessary.
▪ Dilute the spinal fluid according to the kit instructions,
usually in a designated buffer or diluent.
3. Assay Procedure
▪ Add the required volume of controls, specimens, and
standards to the designated wells in the microplate.
▪ Follow manufacturer instructions for the addition of
conjugate, washes, substrate, and stop solution.
▪ Incubate the microplate as specified, ensuring timing
and temperature requirements are strictly followed.
▪ Measure optical density (OD) at the specified
wavelength using a microplate reader.
4. Interpretation of Results
▪ Calculate the cut-off value and determine the results
based on the OD readings.
▪ Valid positive, negative, and indeterminate results per
manufacturer's guidelines.
5. Record All Results
▪ Document all results, including controls, calibrators,
and specimens, in the laboratory information system
or logbook.
B. Confirmation of HTLV-1/-2 Antibodies (e.g., Western
Blot)
1. Confirmation Kit Preparation
▪ Follow the manufacturer's instructions for the
preparation and setup of the confirmation assay.
2. Assay Procedure
▪ Apply diluted spinal fluid specimens, controls, and
standards to the designated areas (e.g., blot strips or
membranes).
▪ Perform washes, enzyme-conjugate, and substrate
incubations as specified by the manufacturer.
▪ Develop the blot and interpret the band patterns
according to the kit instructions.
3. Interpretation of Results
▪ Confirm positive bands for HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 based
on the established criteria.
▪ Record positive, negative, or indeterminate results in
alignment with the confirmatory test guidelines.
4. Documentation and Verification
▪ Document all confirmation test results clearly.
▪ Supervisor review and verification of results for
accuracy and consistency with initial screening.
7. Quality Control
◦ Run positive and negative controls with each assay batch.
Controls must fall within expected ranges for the test run to
be considered valid.
◦ Record and investigate any deviations or out-of-range
control results according to laboratory quality management
policies.
8. Reporting of Results
◦ Results are transmitted and entered into the laboratory
information system (LIS).
◦ Interpretive comments and confirmation results are
appended to the final report for review and verification.
◦ Ensure the secure transmission of results to the requesting
healthcare provider with appropriate commentaries on test
interpretation.
9. Critical Results Handling
◦ Immediate reporting of critical or confirmed positive results
to the requesting clinician as per laboratory critical call
policy.
◦ Documentation of result notification, including date, time,
and the name of the person receiving the report.
