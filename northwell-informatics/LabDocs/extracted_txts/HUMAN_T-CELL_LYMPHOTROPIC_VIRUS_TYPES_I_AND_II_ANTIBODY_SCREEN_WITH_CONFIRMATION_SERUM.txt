Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Human T-Cell
Lymphotropic Virus Types I and II Antibody Screen with
Confirmation, Serum
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized protocol for the qualitative detection and
confirmation of antibodies to Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Types
I and II (HTLV-I/II) in human serum samples using enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) followed by Western blot (WB) for
confirmation. This protocol ensures the accuracy and reliability of test
results and outlines steps for performing, interpreting, and
documenting the results.
1. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel trained in serological
testing within the clinical laboratory setting.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
• Designated lab personnel are responsible for performing the
assay, interpreting results, and documenting all actions and
observations according to this SOP.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring compliance with this
SOP and for handling any discrepancies or incidents that may
affect the test results.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Acceptable Specimens:
• Preferred: 3-5 mL of freshly collected serum stored in a serum
separator tube (SST).
• Stability: Serum samples are stable for up to 7 days when stored
at 2-8°C. For long-term storage, samples must be frozen at -20°C
or lower.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples are not acceptable for this
test.
• Samples received in the laboratory beyond the stability period.
• Specimens without proper labeling or incomplete requisition
forms.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• ELISA Kit for HTLV-I/II (manufacturer and lot number to be
recorded).
• Confirmatory Western Blot Kit (manufacturer and lot number to be
recorded).
• Precision pipettes and tips (calibrated and verified).
• Microplate Reader (with appropriate filters for ELISA).
• Incubator maintained at 37°C.
• Refrigerators/freezers for storage of reagents and samples.
• Vortex mixer, wash bottle, and distilled water.
• Personal protective equipment (PPE).
1. PROCEDURE
A) Initial Screening with ELISA:
1. Preparation:
◦ Thaw and mix all reagents according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
◦ Prepare the serum samples, controls, and calibrators.
2. Assay Procedure:
◦ Add the appropriate volume of serum samples, controls, and
calibrators to the wells of the ELISA plate.
◦ Add the enzyme-labeled antigen and incubate the plate as
specified by the manufacturer (typically 37°C for 60
minutes).
◦ Wash the plate using the provided wash solution. Follow the
recommended wash cycles to minimize background noise.
◦ Add the substrate solution and incubate in the dark at room
temperature for the specified time.
◦ Stop the reaction by adding stop solution.
3. Reading the Plate:
◦ Measure the absorbance (optical density) of each well at the
specified wavelength using a microplate reader.
◦ Calculate the results based on the provided calibrator and
control readings.
4. Interpretation:
◦ Positive, negative, and borderline results are determined
based on the manufacturer's cut-off values.
◦ Positive or borderline results must be confirmed using
Western Blot.
B) Confirmation with Western Blot:
1. Preparation:
◦ Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for reagent
preparation and sample handling.
2. Assay Procedure:
◦ Load the patient samples and controls onto the provided gel
strips.
◦ Proceed with electrophoresis and transfer as outlined in the
kit insert.
◦ Incubate the strips with primary antibody solution.
◦ Wash the strips and incubate with secondary antibody/
enzyme conjugate.
◦ Develop the strips using substrate solution according to the
manufacturer’s protocol.
3. Reading and Interpretation:
◦ Compare the banding pattern of each strip to the provided
standard band pattern for HTLV-I/II.
◦ A positive result requires the presence of specific bands as
defined by the manufacturer.
◦ Negative results will show no bands or non-specific bands
not consistent with HTLV-I/II.
◦ Indeterminate results should be reported accordingly and
may require repeat testing or further investigation.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run positive and negative controls with each batch of tests to
validate the assay performance.
• Document control results and ensure they fall within the
acceptable range before proceeding with patient sample
interpretations.
• If controls fail, identify the source of error, correct it, and repeat
the controls and patient samples.
1. RESULT REPORTING
• Document all results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Ensure the technologist reviews and verifies all results before
releasing them.
• Report confirmed positive results and indeterminate results with
appropriate comments suggesting retesting or additional follow-up
testing.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Negative: No antibodies detected.
• Positive: Presence of antibodies consistent with HTLV-I/II
infection.
• Indeterminate: Suggest retesting after a certain period or further
confirmatory testing.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Potential cross-reactivity with other retroviruses.
• False positives due to technical errors or contamination.
• Sensitivity and specificity are dependent on handling and
following manufacturer instructions.
