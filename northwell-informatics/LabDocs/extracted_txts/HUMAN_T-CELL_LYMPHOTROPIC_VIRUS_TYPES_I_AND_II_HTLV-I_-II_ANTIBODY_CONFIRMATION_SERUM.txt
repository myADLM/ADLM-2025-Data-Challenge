Standard Operating Procedure Human T-cell Lymphotropic Virus
Types I and II (HTLV-I/-II) Antibody Confirmation, Serum
1. Purpose: To accurately confirm the presence of antibodies to
Human T-cell Lymphotropic Virus Types I and II (HTLV-I/-II) in
serum samples and ensure accurate reporting of results.
2. Scope: This procedure applies to all serum samples submitted
for HTLV-I/-II antibody confirmation in the clinical laboratory.
3. Responsibility: Designated laboratory personnel trained in
HTLV-I/-II antibody testing are responsible for executing this
procedure. It is the responsibility of the laboratory supervisor to
ensure all staff members adhere to the outlined protocol.
4. Specimen Requirements:
◦ Specimen type: Serum
◦ Volume: Minimum of 1 mL of serum
◦ Stability: Serum samples should be stored at 2-8°C and
tested within 7 days of collection. If longer storage is
needed, freeze at -20°C or lower.
◦ Unacceptable samples: Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric
samples, and samples showing signs of bacterial
contamination.
5. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies:
◦ HTLV-I/-II Antibody Assay Kit (Western Blot or Immunoblot)
◦ Microcentrifuge tubes
◦ Micropipettes and related tips
◦ Incubator set to 37°C
◦ Refrigerated centrifuge
◦ Vortex mixer
◦ Water bath or heat block
◦ Washing solution and buffer
◦ Positive and negative control sera
◦ Microplate reader (for immunoblot)
6. Quality Control:
◦ Perform quality control with each batch of tests using
positive and negative control sera.
◦ The controls must fall within the expected ranges. If controls
are out of range, investigate and rectify the issue before
proceeding with patient samples.
◦ Document all control results in the Quality Control Log.
7. Procedure: Preparation Steps: a. Ensure all reagents and
samples are brought to room temperature before use. b.
Prepare the necessary washes and buffers as described in the
assay kit insert.
Sample Preparation and Testing: a. Label microcentrifuge tubes
appropriately with the patient identifier. b. Pipette the specified
volume of serum into the labeled microcentrifuge tubes. c. Add the
appropriate volume of dilution buffer to each tube as per the assay kit
instructions. d. Vortex the tubes gently to mix the sample thoroughly.
Incubation and Washing Steps: a. Apply the diluted patient samples
and controls to the assay membrane or wells as directed by the
assay kit. b. Incubate at 37°C for the specified time, ensuring
agitation if required. c. Perform the designated washing steps as
outlined in the kit protocol to remove unbound materials.
Detection and Confirmation: a. Add the conjugate reagent to each
well or membrane and incubate at the recommended temperature
and duration. b. Repeat the washing steps to remove excess
conjugate. c. Add the substrate solution and incubate until color
development is sufficient for interpretation.
Reading and Interpretation: a. Stop the reaction as indicated in the kit
insert. b. Read and interpret the results: - Positive: Presence of
bands corresponding to HTLV-I/-II antigens as described in the kit
manual. - Negative: Absence of specific HTLV-I/-II bands. -
Indeterminate: Presence of non-specific bands or patterns that do not
meet the criteria for a positive result.
Reporting Results:
• Document results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Report results as positive, negative, or indeterminate according to
the interpretation criteria.
• Confirm indeterminate results by retesting the same or a new
sample for verification.
1. Maintenance:
◦ Regularly calibrate and maintain all equipment used in the
assay.
◦ Maintain a log of maintenance activities and calibration
results.
◦ Ensure that all consumables and reagents are within the
expiration dates and document lot numbers of kits used.
2. Reference Intervals:
◦ Positive: Presence of specific HTLV-I/-II antibody bands.
◦ Negative: Absence of HTLV-I/-II antibody bands.
◦ Indeterminate: Non-specific or atypical banding patterns.
3. Method Limitations:
• False positives may occur due to non-specific interactions or
cross-reactivity.
• False negatives may result from early infection or low antibody
levels.
• Refer to the assay kit insert for detailed limitations.
