STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE
1. PURPOSE
To establish a standardized protocol for the detection of HUMAN T-
CELL LYMPHOTROPIC VIRUS TYPE 1 (HTLV-1) BZIP FACTOR
(HBZ) using in situ hybridization (ISH) techniques. This SOP outlines
the analytical phase procedures necessary to ensure accurate and
reliable detection of HBZ in clinical specimens.
Responsibility: All designated laboratory personnel trained in in situ
hybridization techniques and handling of clinical specimens are
responsible for performing these procedures. It is the responsibility of
the laboratory supervisor to ensure compliance with these
procedures and address any identified issues or deviations.
1. DEFINITION
In Situ Hybridization (ISH) is a powerful technique used to localize
specific nucleic acid targets within fixed tissues and cells. This
procedure involves the use of labeled probes to detect the presence
of HTLV-1 bZIP Factor (HBZ) mRNA, an important marker in the
diagnosis and study of HTLV-1-associated diseases.
1. PROCEDURE
Specimen Requirement: Preferred specimens include formalin-fixed,
paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue sections. Specimens must be
properly identified, labeled, and accessioned before proceeding with
the analysis.
Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies:
• Microtome
• Water bath
• Adhesive-coated microscope slides
• Hybridization oven
• Coverslips and reagents for ISH (e.g., Probe, Block, Hybridization
buffer, Wash buffers, Detection System)
• HTLV-1 HBZ-specific probe (fluorescently labeled or
chromogenic)
• Mounting medium
• Positive and negative control tissues
A. Slide Preparation:
1. Sectioning:
◦ Cut 4-5 μm thick sections of FFPE tissue using the
microtome.
◦ Float sections on a water bath set at ~40-45°C and pick up
onto adhesive-coated microscope slides.
2. Dewaxing and Rehydration:
◦ Place slides in a series of xylene baths to remove paraffin
(three changes, 5 minutes each).
◦ Rehydrate sections through a graded series of ethanol
baths (100%, 95%, 70% ethanol) for 5 minutes each and
rinse in deionized water.
B. Probe Hybridization:
1. Pre-hybridization:
◦ Treat sections with appropriate protease or heat-induced
epitope retrieval solution as required by the probe protocol.
◦ Wash sections in 1X PBS for 5 minutes.
◦ Apply blocking solution to each section to prevent non-
specific binding.
2. Hybridization:
◦ Apply an appropriate volume of the labeled HTLV-1 HBZ-
specific probe to each tissue section and cover with
coverslips.
◦ Place slides in a hybridization oven set at the recommended
temperature and time (typically overnight at 37-42°C).
C. Post-hybridization Washes:
1. Remove coverslips and perform a series of stringent washes to
remove unbound and non-specifically bound probes, using the
manufacturer’s recommended washing buffers and conditions.
D. Detection and Visualization:
1. If using a fluorescent probe, apply an anti-fade mounting
medium and coverslip. Observe and capture images using a
fluorescence microscope.
2. If using a chromogenic probe, perform enzymatic or chemical
detection steps as per the probe-specific protocol. Counterstain
with hematoxylin, mount with a permanent mounting medium,
and coverslip.
E. Controls:
• Process positive and negative control tissues alongside patient
specimens to ensure specificity and validity of staining.
• Positive control: Known HTLV-1 HBZ positive tissue
• Negative control: Tissue known to be negative for HTLV-1 HBZ, or
an irrelevant probe hybridization.
F. Interpretation of Results:
• Analyze slides microscopically by trained personnel. Positive
signal for HBZ will be indicated by a specific staining pattern in
the target cells.
• Record all observations, adherence to protocol, and any
deviations noted during the procedure.
G. Documentation and Reporting:
• Document all steps performed, including reagent and probe lot
numbers, incubation times and temperatures, deviations from
protocol, and quality control results.
• Record and review results; prepare reports for clinical correlation.
Quality Assurance/Quality Control:
• Perform regular maintenance and calibration of all equipment.
• Validate new batches of probes and reagents using known control
samples.
• Participate in proficiency testing programs and compare results
for consistency and accuracy.
