Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase Protocol for Human Transforming Growth
Factor Beta 1 (TGF-B1)
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedures involved in the
analytical phase of generating results for Human Transforming
Growth Factor Beta 1 (TGF-B1) in a CLIA-certified laboratory.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all staff members responsible for the
analysis of TGF-B1 levels in human specimens within the laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing the
assay, ensuring that all instruments and reagents are correctly
maintained and calibrated, and that all quality control measures are
adhered to during the process.
4. DEFINITIONS
• TGF-B1: Transforming Growth Factor Beta 1, a cytokine involved
in regulation of cell growth and differentiation.
• ELISA: Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay, a common
technique used for the quantification of proteins such as
cytokines.
5. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• ELISA reader (microplate reader)
• Micropipettes and tips
• Human TGF-B1 ELISA kit (which includes capture antibody,
detection antibody, substrate solution, stop solution, etc.)
• Calibrated microplate washer
• Incubator set at 37°C
• Multichannel pipettes (optional)
• Vortex mixer
• Deionized water
6. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation
• Ensure that plasma or serum samples are properly collected,
received, and accessioned before analysis.
• Thaw frozen samples at room temperature and mix well by
vortexing.
• Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles to maintain sample integrity.
B. Reagent Preparation
• Follow the manufacturer's instructions specific to the Human TGF-
B1 ELISA kit for preparing the reagents.
• Reconstitute and dilute standards, controls, and detection
antibodies according to the protocol provided in the kit insert.
C. Assay Procedure
1. Coat ELISA Plate:
◦ Add 100 µL of the capture antibody to each well of the
ELISA plate.
◦ Seal the plate and incubate overnight at 4°C.
2. Blocking:
◦ Add 200 µL of blocking buffer to each well.
◦ Incubate for 1-2 hours at room temperature to block non-
specific binding sites.
3. Add Samples and Standards:
◦ Remove blocking buffer and wash wells 3-4 times with wash
buffer.
◦ Add 100 µL of standards, controls, and samples to the
appropriate wells.
◦ Incubate for 2 hours at room temperature or overnight at
4°C under shaking conditions.
4. Add Detection Antibody:
◦ Wash the plate 5 times with wash buffer to remove unbound
proteins.
◦ Add 100 µL of the detection antibody to each well.
◦ Incubate for 1 hour at room temperature.
5. Substrate Reaction:
◦ Wash the plate 7 times with wash buffer.
◦ Add 100 µL of substrate solution to each well.
◦ Incubate in the dark at room temperature for 15-30 minutes
or until the desired color intensity is developed.
6. Stop Reaction:
◦ Add 100 µL of stop solution to each well to terminate the
reaction.
7. Read Plate:
◦ Measure the absorbance at 450 nm using an ELISA plate
reader within 30 minutes of stopping the reaction.
D. Calculation and Interpretation of Results
• Generate a standard curve by plotting the absorbance values of
the standards against their concentrations.
• Calculate the concentration of TGF-B1 in the samples based on
the standard curve.
• Ensure the values fall within the assay’s dynamic range.
• Any results outside the range should be reported as < LLoQ
(Lower Limit of Quantitation) or > ULoQ (Upper Limit of
Quantitation).
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run quality control samples (low, medium, and high TGF-B1
concentrations) with each batch of assays to ensure accuracy and
precision.
• Monitor the performance of the ELISA reader and microplate
washer, and maintain calibration logs.
• Document lot numbers and expiry dates of all reagents used.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Verify all results according to laboratory policies and procedures.
• Enter data into the Laboratory Information System (LIS) ensuring
a review for accuracy.
• Print and file the results in the patient’s laboratory report.
9. SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS
• Follow all laboratory safety protocols including the use of personal
protective equipment (PPE).
• Handle all reagents and human samples as potential biohazards.

11. REVISION LOG
• This SOP will be reviewed and updated annually or as needed
when new procedures or instrumentation are introduced.
By adhering to this protocol, the laboratory ensures reliable and
reproducible results for the measurement of Human TGF-B1 in
clinical specimens.
