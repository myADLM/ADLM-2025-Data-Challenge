Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Analytical Phase for Generating Results for Hunter Syndrome
(Full Gene Analysis)
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the steps and procedures for the analytical phase
in the detection of Hunter Syndrome by analyzing the IDS (iduronate
2-sulfatase) gene using a full gene analysis technique. The
procedure is designed to ensure accurate, reproducible, and timely
reporting of results to aid in the diagnosis and subsequent
management of patients suspected of having Hunter Syndrome.
2. APPLICABILITY
This procedure applies to the Clinical Laboratory Improvement
Amendments (CLIA)-certified laboratory conducting full gene analysis
for Hunter Syndrome.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
Trained laboratory personnel are responsible for performing the
procedures described in this SOP. The laboratory supervisor or
designated personnel must ensure compliance with the SOP and
handle any discrepancies or quality control issues.
4. DEFINITIONS
Hunter Syndrome (Mucopolysaccharidosis II): A lysosomal storage
disorder caused by mutations in the IDS gene, leading to defective
iduronate 2-sulfatase enzyme activity.
5. MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT
• IDS gene-specific primers and probes
• PCR reagents (Master Mix, dNTPs, Taq polymerase)
• DNA extraction kit
• Thermal cycler
• Agarose gel electrophoresis apparatus
• DNA sequencing platform (e.g., Sanger sequencing or Next-
Generation Sequencing)
• Appropriate positive and negative controls
• DNA ladder
• Microcentrifuge
• Pipettes and filtered tips
• Analytical software for sequence analysis
6. PROCEDURE
6.1 DNA Extraction
1. Follow the DNA extraction kit protocol to isolate genomic DNA
from patient samples.
2. Assess the quality and quantity of the extracted DNA using a
Nanodrop or Qubit fluorometer.
6.2 PCR Amplification
1. Set up the PCR reaction as follows:
◦ Master Mix: 25 μL
◦ Forward Primer (10 μM): 1 μL
◦ Reverse Primer (10 μM): 1 μL
◦ DNA Template: 2 μL (50 ng)
◦ Nuclease-Free Water: Adjust to a final volume of 50 μL
2. Perform the PCR as per the following thermal cycling
conditions:
◦ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 3 minutes
◦ Cycle (35 cycles):
▪ Denaturation: 95°C for 30 seconds
▪ Annealing: 55-60°C for 30 seconds (ideal temperature
depends on the primers)
▪ Extension: 72°C for 1 minute
◦ Final extension: 72°C for 5 minutes
3. Hold at 4°C until further analysis.
6.3 Gel Electrophoresis
1. Prepare a 1.5% agarose gel with ethidium bromide.
2. Load the PCR products alongside a DNA ladder to verify the
amplification.
3. Run the gel at 100V for 30-45 minutes.
4. Visualize the DNA bands under UV light and document the
results.
6.4 DNA Sequencing
1. Purify the PCR product using a suitable purification kit.
2. Quantify the purified PCR product.
3. Set up sequencing reactions using purified PCR product and
sequencing primers.
◦ For Sanger sequencing, follow the protocol specific to the
sequencer being used.
◦ For Next-Generation Sequencing, prepare the library as per
the manufacturer's instructions and proceed with
sequencing.
4. Analyze the sequencing data using appropriate software to
identify mutations in the IDS gene.
5. Confirm any detected variants by re-amplification and
resequencing if necessary.
6.5 Quality Control
1. Include positive and negative controls in each PCR and
sequencing run to ensure the validity of the results.
2. Any anomalies in control results must be addressed before
proceeding with patient result analysis.
3. Validate all new lots of reagents and verify by comparison with
previous results.
6.6 Interpretation of Results
1. Identify mutations by comparing the patient's sequence data
with the reference IDS gene sequence.
2. Report any pathogenic variants, variants of unknown
significance (VUS), or benign variants.
3. Utilize databases such as ClinVar, HGMD, and others for
variant interpretation.
6.7 Documentation
1. Record all observations, controls, and results in the laboratory
information system (LIS).
2. Prepare a comprehensive report detailing the genetic findings
and their clinical significance.
3. Ensure that all data is reviewed and verified by a qualified
laboratory supervisor or geneticist before releasing results.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Ensure that results are transmitted from the sequencing
platform to the LIS securely.
2. The technologist must review and verify the results for accuracy
and completeness.
3. Report critical findings promptly following the laboratory's
critical value reporting procedure.
8. REFERENCE INTERVALS
N/A (The IDS gene analysis is qualitative, identifying presence of
mutations rather than quantitative measurement.)
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
1. The sensitivity and specificity depend on the technology used
(Sanger sequencing vs. NGS).
2. PCR inhibitors in the sample could potentially lead to false-
negative results.
3. Rare variants not covered by the primers or probes used in the
analysis may be missed.
