Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for HUNTINGTON
DISEASE MOLECULAR ANALYSIS
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized protocol for conducting molecular analysis
to detect Huntington Disease (HD) in patients using PCR
(Polymerase Chain Reaction) and gel electrophoresis techniques.
This SOP ensures consistency, accuracy, and reliability of test
results.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen type:
• Whole blood collected in EDTA (lavender top tube)
Collection:
• Collect 5-10 mL of whole blood in an EDTA tube.
• Label the specimen with patient identification information (name,
date of birth, date/time of collection).
Specimen storage:
• Store at 2-8°C. Do not freeze.
• Specimens must be processed within 72 hours of collection.
• Extracted DNA should be stored at -20°C or -80°C for long-term
storage.
3. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
Equipment:
• Centrifuge
• PCR thermal cycler
• Agarose gel electrophoresis apparatus
• UV transilluminator or gel documentation system
• Micropipettes and filter tips
• Vortex mixer
• Microcentrifuge tubes
• Heat block (optional)
Reagents:
• DNA extraction kit
• PCR master mix reagents (Taq polymerase, dNtps, MgCl2,
primers, buffer)
• Agarose
• Ethidium bromide or an alternative nucleic acid stain
• 1X TAE or TBE buffer
• DNA ladder (molecular weight marker)
• Loading dye
4. PROCEDURE
A. DNA Extraction:
1. Label microcentrifuge tubes with patient identifiers.
2. Follow the DNA extraction kit protocol to isolate genomic DNA
from whole blood.
3. Quantify DNA concentration using a spectrophotometer or other
appropriate method.
4. Normalize DNA concentrations to 50-100 ng/µL for PCR.
B. PCR Amplification:
1. Prepare the PCR master mix according to the following (per
reaction):
◦ 12.5 µL 2X PCR Master Mix
◦ 1 µL Forward Primer (10 µM)
◦ 1 µL Reverse Primer (10 µM)
◦ 2 µL DNA template (50-100 ng)
◦ For a final volume=25 µL: Add DNase/RNase-free water to
the final volume.
2. Create a negative control (no DNA template) and a positive
control (known HD-positive DNA).
3. Program the PCR thermal cycler with the following conditions:
◦ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 5 min
◦ 35 cycles of:
▪ Denaturation: 95°C for 30 sec
▪ Annealing: 55-60°C for 30 sec (depending on primer Tm)
▪ Extension: 72°C for 45 sec
◦ Final extension: 72°C for 5 min
4. Store PCR products at 4°C until ready for analysis.
C. Agarose Gel Electrophoresis:
1. Prepare a 2% agarose gel with ethidium bromide (or alternative
nucleic acid stain) in 1X TAE or TBE buffer.
2. Pour the gel into the casting tray with a comb and allow it to
solidify.
3. Load 5 µL of PCR product mixed with loading dye into each
well.
4. Include a DNA ladder in a separate well.
5. Run the gel at 100-120V for approximately 45 minutes.
6. Visualize the bands using a UV transilluminator or a gel
documentation system.
5. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
1. Compare the patient sample bands with the DNA ladder and
positive control:
◦ Normal allele: 10-35 CAG repeats
◦ Intermediate allele: 36-39 CAG repeats
◦ Pathogenic allele: ≥40 CAG repeats
2. Document the length of the CAG repeats for each patient
sample.
3. Confirm any pathogenic results with a second independent
PCR amplification and gel electrophoresis.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Review and verify all results by the designated technologist.
2. Document results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
for clinician review.
3. Generate a report including the following:
◦ Patient identification
◦ Specimen type and collection date/time
◦ Number of CAG repeats detected
◦ Interpretation of results based on CAG repeat count
◦ Any relevant comments or recommendations
7. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Run positive and negative controls with each batch of PCR
reactions.
2. Document any deviations or issues encountered during testing
and report to the supervisor.
3. Regularly calibrate and maintain all equipment according to
manufacturer instructions.

• Manufacturer’s instruction manual for DNA extraction kit.
• PCR master mix and primer datasheets.
• Agarose gel electrophoresis protocol.
9. SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS
1. Handle all biological specimens using Universal Precautions.
2. Dispose of all biological waste and chemicals according to
established safety protocols.
3. Wear personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves, lab
coat, and safety glasses during all experimental procedures.
10. TROUBLESHOOTING
• Failed PCR: Check reagent quality, concentrations, and
thermocycler conditions.
• Non-specific bands: Optimize annealing temperature or primer
design.
• Weak bands: Increase DNA template amount or enhance PCR
conditions.
This SOP provides a comprehensive procedure for molecular
analysis of Huntington Disease. Consistent adherence to this
protocol ensures accurate, reliable, and reproducible results for
patient diagnosis and management.
