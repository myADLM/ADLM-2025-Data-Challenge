Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
1. TITLE: Protocol for the Analytical Phase of Generating Results for
Hurler Syndrome, Full Gene Analysis, VARIES
2. PURPOSE: To provide a standardized procedure for the analytical
phase including the preparation, testing, and documentation required
to generate reliable and accurate results for Hurler Syndrome, Full
Gene Analysis.
3. SCOPE: This SOP is applicable to all trained laboratory personnel
performing the analytical phase of Hurler Syndrome, Full Gene
Analysis in a CLIA-certified laboratory.
4. RESPONSIBILITIES:
4.1. It is the responsibility of all laboratory personnel involved in this
process to follow the protocols outlined in this SOP. 4.2. Laboratory
supervisors must ensure that all personnel are properly trained and
adhere to this SOP. 4.3. It is the responsibility of the laboratory staff
to document all procedures and any deviations from the SOP.
5. DEFINITIONS: Hurler Syndrome (MPS I) is a genetic disorder
caused by mutations in the IDUA gene. Full gene analysis includes
sequencing and mutation detection in the entire gene.
6. PROCEDURE:
6.1. Pre-analytical Preparations: 6.1.1. Ensure specimen has been
collected, received, and accessioned. 6.1.2. Verify the patient’s
information against requisition forms to ensure accuracy. 6.1.3.
Perform DNA extraction from the provided sample using validated
extraction methods (refer to DNA Extraction SOP for detailed
procedure).
6.2. DNA Quantification and Quality Assessment: 6.2.1. Quantify
the extracted DNA using spectrophotometry (e.g., NanoDrop) and/or
fluorometry (e.g., Qubit) to ensure sufficient quantity. 6.2.2. Assess
DNA integrity using agarose gel electrophoresis. 6.2.3. Document
DNA concentration and quality in the sample log.
6.3. Library Preparation: 6.3.1. Prepare sequencing libraries
according to the library preparation kit manufacturer’s instructions
(e.g., Illumina, NEBNext). 6.3.2. Check the quality and size of the
libraries using a bioanalyzer or similar instrument. 6.3.3. Document
library preparation details and quality assessment in the laboratory
notebook.
6.4. Sequencing: 6.4.1. Load prepared libraries onto the sequencing
platform (e.g., Illumina MiSeq, NextSeq) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. 6.4.2. Select appropriate sequencing
parameters (e.g., read length, chemistry). 6.4.3. Monitor the
sequencing run and ensure that it proceeds without technical issues.
6.4.4. Document sequencer run details and any deviations
encountered during the process.
6.5. Bioinformatics Analysis: 6.5.1. Transfer raw sequencing data
to the bioinformatics team or designated bioinformatics pipeline.
6.5.2. Perform quality control on raw sequencing data using tools like
FastQC. 6.5.3. Trim adapters and low-quality bases using trimming
software (e.g., Trimmomatic). 6.5.4. Align reads to the human
reference genome (e.g., GRCh37/GRCh38) using an appropriate
aligner (e.g., BWA, Bowtie2). 6.5.5. Call variants using variant calling
software (e.g., GATK, FreeBayes) and annotate variants using
annotation tools (e.g., VEP, ANNOVAR). 6.5.6. Perform variant
filtration to identify pathogenic variants in the IDUA gene. 6.5.7.
Document bioinformatics pipeline and software versions used.
6.6. Data Interpretation and Results Generation: 6.6.1. Interpret
the identified variants with reference to clinical databases and
literature (e.g., ClinVar, HGMD). 6.6.2. Classify each variant
according to ACMG guidelines (e.g., pathogenic, likely pathogenic,
VUS, likely benign, benign). 6.6.3. Generate a detailed report
including patient information, methods, results, and interpretation of
identified variants. 6.6.4. Review the report for accuracy and
completeness by a qualified geneticist.
6.7. Results Delivery and Documentation: 6.7.1. Securely transmit
the final report to the ordering physician or patient’s health provider.
6.7.2. Maintain documentation of all steps, quality control results, and
final report in the laboratory information system (LIS) or electronic
medical records (EMR). 6.7.3. Archive all raw data, intermediate files,
and final reports according to institutional policies and regulatory
requirements.
7. QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE: 7.1. Perform regular
maintenance and calibration of laboratory equipment. 7.2. Include
positive and negative controls in each sequencing run. 7.3. Conduct
periodic proficiency testing and participate in external quality
assurance programs. 7.4. Review and update the SOP annually or as
needed based on technological and procedural advancements.
8. REFERENCES: 8.1. Manufacturer’s manuals for DNA extraction
kits, library preparation kits, sequencing platforms, and bioinformatics
software. 8.2. ACMG guidelines for the interpretation of sequence
variants. 8.3. Relevant clinical databases such as ClinVar and
HGMD.
9. REVISION HISTORY:
• Version 1.0 [Date] – Initial Release
This protocol must be signed and dated by authorized laboratory
personnel to indicate review and approval for implementation. The
signature page should be retained with the SOP documentation.
