Standard Operating Procedure for Analytical Phase in
Generating Results for HLA Antibody Testing
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedures for the detection and identification of
human leukocyte antigen (HLA) antibodies in patient sera using the
Luminex platform.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing and
documenting the analytical procedures for HLA antibody testing. It is
the responsibility of all staff to ensure the accuracy and reliability of
test results.
2. DEFINITION
HLA antibodies are antibodies directed against HLA antigens, which
can cause alloimmunization and complications in transfusion and
transplantation. The Luminex technology allows for the detection of
these antibodies using bead-based flow cytometry.
3. PROCEDURE
A. Reagents and Supplies
• Luminex Beads (LABScreen Mixed or LABScreen Single Antigen)
• Luminex Wash Buffer
• Luminex Assay Buffer
• Luminex Conjugate (e.g., Goat Anti-Human IgG PE)
• Positive Control Serum
• Negative Control Serum
• Patient Serum
• Microtiter Plates
• Plate Seals
• Luminex Instrumentation
B. Specimen Requirements
1. Preferred/Acceptable Specimens:
◦ Fresh or properly stored serum samples from patients.
◦ Hemolyzed, lipemic, or microbial-contaminated samples are
generally unacceptable as they could interfere with accurate
antibody detection.
C. Equipment Calibration and Maintenance:
1. Ensure that the Luminex instrument is calibrated and
maintained according to the manufacturer's instructions.
2. Record calibration and maintenance activities in the equipment
log.
D. Testing Procedure:
1. Preparation: a. Thaw serum samples and control sera at room
temperature. b. Vortex samples gently to ensure homogeneity.
c. Label microtiter plate wells appropriately for test samples,
positive control, negative control, and blank wells.
2. Incubation with Beads: a. Add 5 µL of Luminex Beads to each
well of a microtiter plate. b. Add 20 µL of serum sample to the
appropriate wells. c. Add 20 µL of positive control serum to
control wells. d. Add 20 µL of negative control serum to control
wells. e. Pipette 20 µL of assay buffer to the blank wells. f.
Cover the plate with a plate seal and incubate for 30 minutes at
room temperature on a shaker at 600-800 rpm.
3. Washing: a. Following incubation, remove the plate seal. b.
Remove liquid from the wells by aspiration or decanting, then
blot on absorbent towels. c. Wash the beads three times with
200 µL of wash buffer for each wash. d. After the final wash,
gently blot the plate on absorbent towels to remove residual
wash buffer.
4. Detection: a. Add 100 µL of Luminex Conjugate (Goat Anti-
Human IgG PE) to each well. b. Cover the plate with a new
plate seal and incubate for 30 minutes at room temperature on
a shaker at 600-800 rpm. c. After incubation, wash as
previously described.
5. Reading and Analysis: a. Resuspend the beads in 80 µL of
wash buffer and incubate on the shaker for 5 minutes. b.
Analyze the plate using the Luminex instrument following the
manufacturer’s instructions to obtain the mean fluorescence
intensity (MFI) for each sample.
E. Quality Control:
1. Include positive and negative control sera in each test run for
quality assurance.
2. Check that the MFI values for the controls fall within the
predefined range as indicated by the reagent manufacturers.
3. Document all quality control results and any corrective actions
taken if controls fall outside the acceptable range in the QC log.
4. REPORTING RESULTS
A. Result Interpretation:
1. MFI values above the manufacturer’s cutoff threshold indicate
the presence of HLA antibodies.
2. Calculate the median MFI for each sample and compare to
manufacturer’s guidelines and pre-established criteria to
determine positive, negative, or borderline results.
B. Documentation and Review:
1. Enter test results into the laboratory information system (LIS).
2. Review and verify results prior to releasing them. Any critical or
unusual findings should be reviewed by a supervisor.
5. RECORD KEEPING AND ARCHIVING
Maintain all records of test results, calibration, maintenance, and
quality control in accordance with laboratory record-keeping policies
and regulatory requirements.
