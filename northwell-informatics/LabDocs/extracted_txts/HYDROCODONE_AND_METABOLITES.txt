Standard Operating Procedure for Analysis of Hydrocodone and
Metabolites
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for the analysis of Hydrocodone and its
metabolites in biological specimens, ensuring accurate and reliable
results.
1. SCOPE
This SOP applies to the analysis of Hydrocodone and its metabolites
in all biological specimens received in the laboratory.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
• All designated laboratory personnel are responsible for following
this procedure.
• Laboratory supervisors are responsible for ensuring compliance
and managing quality control.
1. REFERENCES
• CLIA regulations
• Manufacturer's instructions for relevant equipment and reagents
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred Specimen: Urine
• Collection and storage: Specimens should be collected in a clean
container and stored at 2-8°C if not analyzed immediately. If
unable to analyze within 48 hours, freeze at -20°C.
• Unacceptable Specimens: Improperly labeled specimens,
hemolyzed specimens, specimens in containers that are not leak-
proof.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• LC-MS/MS (Liquid Chromatography – Mass Spectrometry)
• Analytical balance
• Pipettes and tips
• Reagent kits for hydrocodone and metabolites
• Vortex mixer
• Centrifuge
• Sample preparation workstation
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
1. PROCEDURE
7.1. Sample Preparation
1. Thaw frozen specimens at room temperature.
2. Mix all specimens thoroughly.
3. Aliquot 1 mL of urine into a labeled test tube.
4. Add internal standard according to the reagent kit instructions.
5. Vortex samples for 30 seconds.
6. Centrifuge the samples at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes to remove
particulates.
7.2. Calibration and Quality Control
1. Prepare calibration standards and quality control (QC) samples
as described in the reagent kit instructions.
2. Ensure calibration standards cover the expected range of
analyte concentrations in specimens.
3. Run both calibration standards and QC samples at the
beginning of the analysis to verify system performance.
7.3. LC-MS/MS Analysis
1. Set up the LC-MS/MS system following manufacturer
guidelines.
2. Load prepared specimens, calibration standards, and QC
samples into the autosampler.
3. Commence the analytical run according to the following LC-MS/
MS parameters:
◦ Column: C18, 2.1 x 50 mm, 1.7 µm
◦ Mobile Phase A: 0.1% formic acid in water
◦ Mobile Phase B: 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile
◦ Flow rate: 0.3 mL/min
◦ Gradient: Start at 5% B, ramp to 95% B over 6 minutes, hold
for 2 minutes, return to 5% B
◦ Injection volume: 10 µL
◦ MS/MS detection settings for hydrocodone, hydromorphone,
norhydrocodone, and NDHM.
7.4. Data Collection and Processing
1. Check for peak resolution, retention time, and signal intensity
for all analytes.
2. Ensure the internal standard is consistent across all samples.
3. Integrate peaks and quantify using calibration curve data.
4. Verify QC sample results. QC results must fall within
established limits. Repeat analysis if QC fails.
5. REPORTING RESULTS
• Print and review all chromatograms and quantitation reports.
• Compare results with established reference ranges for clinical
relevance.
• Enter verified results into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
• Report any critical values to the appropriate healthcare provider
immediately.
1. QUALITY CONTROL AND TROUBLESHOOTING
• Regularly calibrate and maintain the LC-MS/MS equipment.
• Perform bi-weekly and monthly inter-laboratory comparisons.
• Document any deviations, issues, and corrective action taken.
1. SAFETY AND COMPLIANCE
• Wear appropriate PPE (gloves, lab coat, safety glasses).
• Follow waste disposal regulations for hazardous materials.
• Adhere to all laboratory safety protocols and policies.
1. REVIEW AND REVISION
• This SOP should be reviewed annually and revised as needed.
• Document all changes in the revision history log.

• Manufacturer's manual for LC-MS/MS system.
• Reagent kit package insert for hydrocodone and metabolites.
• Relevant clinical and laboratory standards.
