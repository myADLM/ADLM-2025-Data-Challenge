Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for HYDROCODONE WITH
METABOLITE CONFIRMATION, RANDOM, URINE
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedure
for the analytical phase of generating results for Hydrocodone
with Metabolite Confirmation in random urine samples. This
includes the steps for preparing, processing, and analyzing
specimens to ensure accurate and reliable results.
2. SPECIMEN Preferred/acceptable:
• 30 mL random urine sample collected in a sterile container.
• Maintain the specimen at room temperature and ensure it is
received in the laboratory within 4 hours of collection for optimal
results.
Unacceptable:
• Specimens received with no proper labeling (patient's name,
collection date, and time).
• Samples that are less than 20 mL.
• Specimens received more than 24 hours after collection without
proper refrigeration.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Gas Chromatograph-Mass Spectrometer (GC-MS) or Liquid
Chromatography-Mass Spectrometer (LC-MS)
• Centrifuge
• pH strips
• Urine specimen cups
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Reagent kits for Hydrocodone and metabolite confirmation
• Calibration standards specific for Hydrocodone and its
metabolites
• Control samples (positive and negative)
1. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation
1. Verify the specimen is properly labeled and meets acceptance
criteria.
2. Record the specimen details in the lab logbook or Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
3. Immediately refrigerate the specimen if it cannot be analyzed
within 4 hours.
4. Mix the urine specimen thoroughly before aliquoting for
analysis.
5. Check and adjust the pH of the urine sample if it is not within
the range of 6.0 – 8.0.
6. Centrifuge the urine specimen at 3000 RPM for 10 minutes to
remove particulate matter.
7. Transfer the supernatant to a clean tube for analysis.
B. Internal Calibration and Quality Control
1. Prepare the calibration standards and quality control samples
concurrently with the specimens.
2. Include at least one negative control and two levels of positive
controls (low and high) in each batch.
3. Ensure the internal standards are added to each sample,
calibration standard, and control sample.
C. Instrumentation Set-Up
1. Calibrate the GC-MS or LC-MS instrument as per the
manufacturer’s instructions using the prepared calibration
standards.
2. Verify the calibration with quality control materials to ensure the
system is functioning within acceptable limits.
D. Sample Analysis
1. Load the prepared samples, calibration standards, and control
samples onto the GC-MS or LC-MS.
2. Set the instrument parameters specific for Hydrocodone and its
major metabolites (e.g., Hydromorphone).
3. Initiate the sequence run and monitor the instrument for any
errors or deviations.
E. Data Analysis and Interpretation
1. Once the analysis is complete, retrieve and inspect the
chromatograms and mass spectra.
2. Verify the peak identification and integration against the
calibration standards.
3. Ensure all control samples meet the acceptance criteria before
reporting results.
4. Quantitate the concentration of Hydrocodone and its
metabolites using the pre-determined calibration curve.
5. Validate the results by comparing the retention times and peak
ratios between known standards and patient specimens.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
7. Enter the quantitated results into the laboratory information
system (LIS).
8. Results that fall outside the established reference range should
be flagged.
9. Critical results must be communicated to the requesting
healthcare provider immediately with proper documentation.
10. Generate a final report and include interpretation notes
indicating the presence and quantity of Hydrocodone and its
metabolites.
11. QUALITY CONTROL AND MAINTENANCE
12. Perform routine maintenance and calibration of the GC-MS/LC-
MS as per the manufacturer's guidelines.
13. Document all maintenance activities and any deviations in
performance.
14. Participate in external proficiency testing to ensure adherence
to analytical standards.
15. Review and update the SOP annually or when significant
changes occur in the methodology.

1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Detectability of low concentration levels may be affected by the
sample integrity or instrument sensitivity.
• Cross-reactivity with other opiates or medications may produce
false-positive results if not properly accounted for.
• Proper sample collection and handling are critical for accurate
results; deviations from these protocols can impact outcome
validity.
