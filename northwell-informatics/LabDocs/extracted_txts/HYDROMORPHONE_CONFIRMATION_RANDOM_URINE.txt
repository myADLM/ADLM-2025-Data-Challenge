Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for HYDROMORPHONE
CONFIRMATION, RANDOM, URINE
1. PURPOSE: To confirm the presence of hydromorphone in urine
samples in an accurate, reliable and timely manner, using a
validated analytical method.
2. SCOPE: This procedure applies to all personnel involved in the
processing and analysis of random urine samples for
hydromorphone confirmation in the laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY:
• Designated laboratory staff members are responsible for carrying
out this procedure.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring compliance, addressing
any issues, and confirming results interpretation.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS:
• Specimen type: Random urine
• Preferred volume: 30 mL
• Minimum volume: 10 mL
• Specimen collection and handling: Urine should be collected in a
clean, sterile container. Upon receipt, samples should be logged
into the laboratory information system (LIS) and stored at 2-8°C if
not processed immediately.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES:
• Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) unit or Liquid
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) unit
• Certified reference standards for hydromorphone
• Internal standards (recommended: deuterated hydromorphone)
• Calibrators and control materials
• Methanol, acetonitrile, and formic acid (all HPLC grade)
• Solid phase extraction (SPE) cartridges
1. PROCEDURE: 6.1 Sample Preparation: a. Thaw urine samples
to room temperature if previously refrigerated. b. Vortex the
sample to ensure homogeneity. c. Pipette 5 mL of urine into a
labeled disposable plastic tube. d. Add 50 μL of internal
standard to each sample. e. Mix thoroughly by vortexing.
6.2 Hydrolysis (if necessary): a. To hydrolyze any hydromorphone
conjugates, add 1 mL of a beta-glucuronidase enzyme solution to the
urine sample. b. Incubate the sample at 37°C for 2 hours.
6.3 Extraction: a. Condition the SPE cartridge with 2 mL of methanol
followed by 2 mL of water. b. Load the urine sample onto the SPE
cartridge. c. Wash the cartridge with 2 mL of water, followed by 2 mL
of 5% methanol in water. d. Elute the analytes with 2 mL of methanol
into a clean labeled tube.
6.4 Drying and Reconstitution: a. Dry the eluate under a stream of
nitrogen at 40°C. b. Reconstitute the dried residue in 200 μL of
mobile phase (e.g., 50:50 water:acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid). c.
Transfer the solution into an HPLC vial with an insert.
6.5 Instrumentation: a. Load the prepared HPLC vials into the
autosampler of the LC-MS/MS or GC-MS unit. b. Set up the
instrument according to the manufacturer’s instructions and validated
parameters. c. Include calibrators and quality control samples in each
run.
6.6 Calibration and Quality Control: a. Prepare a calibration curve
using certified reference standards of hydromorphone. b. Ensure
quality control samples (low, medium, and high concentrations) are
run with each batch to assess assay performance. c. Analyze the
calibrators and QC samples to verify the instrument's accuracy and
precision.
6.7 Sample Analysis: a. Inject the prepared samples into the
instrument. b. Record the chromatograms and mass spectra for
analysis. c. Identify and quantify hydromorphone using the calibration
curve and comparing retention times and mass-to-charge ratios.
1. REPORTING RESULTS:
• Report hydromorphone concentrations greater than the lower limit
of quantification (LLOQ) detected in the samples.
• Results should be reviewed and verified by a qualified
technologist.
• Ensure all reports include results, units of measure, calibration
status, and any comments on sample integrity or quality control.
1. QUALITY CONTROL AND ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:
• Run quality control samples with each batch and verify that
results fall within acceptable ranges.
• Calibration curves must meet the established criteria for linearity
and R2 value.
• Control results must be within ±2 standard deviations of the mean
for the specific control materials.
• Any deviations must be documented, and corrective actions must
be taken.
1. RECORD KEEPING & DOCUMENTATION:
• Maintain logs of sample receipt, handling, processing, and
analysis in the laboratory information system (LIS).
• Retain quality control, calibration, and analytical data for all
samples according to laboratory policies and regulatory
requirements.
1. NOTES:
• Ensure this SOP is reviewed and revised periodically as needed
or when there are changes in methodology, instrumentation, or
regulatory requirements.
• Follow appropriate safety protocols for handling chemicals and
biological specimens.
