Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Hydroxychloroquine, Serum
1. PURPOSE
This procedure outlines the steps to be followed for the accurate and
precise analysis of hydroxychloroquine levels in serum samples. It
ensures the use of validated methods to deliver reliable results within
acceptable limits, thus supporting proper patient diagnosis and
management.
Responsibility:
All laboratory staff conducting this assay must be trained and
deemed competent. It is the responsibility of the designated
personnel to follow this procedure accurately, document necessary
information, and perform any corrective actions if required.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
• Specimen Type: Serum
• Collection Container: Red-top tube or serum separator tube
(SST)
• Volume Required: Minimum of 1 mL
• Handling: Allow blood to clot at room temperature, then
centrifuge and separate serum within 2 hours.
• Storage: Refrigerate serum samples at 2-8°C if analysis is to be
performed within 7 days. For longer storage, freeze serum at
-20°C or lower.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed samples.
• Samples collected in tubes containing anticoagulants (e.g., EDTA,
citrate, or heparin).
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Liquid chromatography (LC) system equipped with tandem mass
spectrometry (MS/MS)
• Calibrators and controls specific for hydroxychloroquine
• Mobile phases: typically aqueous buffers and organic solvents as
per method validation
• Hydroxychloroquine standards
• Internal standard (e.g., hydroxychloroquine-d4, if applicable)
• Sample vials and HPLC compatible caps
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes and tips (calibrated for precision)
1. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation:
1. Thaw frozen samples at room temperature, if applicable.
2. Vortex all samples, calibrators, and controls.
3. Aliquot 200 µL of serum into labeled sample vials.
4. Add a predefined volume of internal standard (if applicable) to
each vial.
5. Add appropriate extraction solvent according to the validated
method.
6. Vortex and centrifuge the vials at 14,000 RPM for 10 minutes.
7. Transfer the supernatant to a clean HPLC-compatible vial for
LC-MS/MS analysis.
B. LC-MS/MS Analysis:
1. Set up the liquid chromatography system with the appropriate
column and mobile phases.
2. Optimize LC gradient according to the method validation.
3. Set MS parameters including source temperature, desolvation
gas, and ion transitions for hydroxychloroquine and internal
standard (if applicable).
4. Perform system suitability tests using standards to ensure peak
resolution and signal intensity.
5. Run calibrators, controls, and patient samples in the following
order: calibrators first, followed by controls, then patient
samples, with periodic controls interspersed to monitor run
stability.
C. Quantification:
1. Use the calibration curve generated from the standards to
quantify hydroxychloroquine concentration in patient samples.
2. Ensure all quality control samples meet acceptance criteria
before proceeding to report patient results.
3. QUALITY CONTROL AND CALIBRATION
• Use commercially available hydroxychloroquine quality control
materials at different concentration levels.
• At least two levels of QC must be included in each batch of
patient samples analyzed.
• Calibrate the LC-MS/MS system using certified
hydroxychloroquine standards before running patient samples.
• Acceptable ranges for QC results must be within ±20% of the
target value.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Report hydroxychloroquine serum concentration in ng/mL or as
specified by the laboratory protocol.
• Transmit results to the Laboratory Information System (LIS) post-
verification by the technologist.
1. REFERENCE INTERVAL
• Therapeutic range: 500 – 2000 ng/mL (to be confirmed with
updated clinical references).
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Ensure no cross-contamination or carry-over between samples by
properly rinsing the columns and equipment.
• Refer to LC-MS/MS method validation reports for specific
limitations on sensitivity, specificity, and interferences.

1. REVISION HISTORY
• Document the date of SOP creation, review dates, and any
revisions made.
Note: Ensure that this SOP aligns with both the laboratory's internal
policies and external regulatory requirements before implementation.
Additionally, all personalized references such as LIS codes and
specific storage times may need adjustment per lab settings.
