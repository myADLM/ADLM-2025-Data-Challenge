Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Procedure for Quantification of Hydroxyglutaric
Acids, Glutaric Acid, Ethylmalonic Acid, and Methylsuccinic Acid in
Blood Spot
1. PURPOSE The analytical procedure aims to accurately quantify
levels of Hydroxyglutaric Acids, Glutaric Acid, Ethylmalonic Acid, and
Methylsuccinic Acid in blood spot specimens. This is essential for
diagnosing metabolic disorders associated with organic acidemias.
Responsibility: All trained laboratory personnel are responsible for
conducting the analysis and adhering to this SOP. It is the
responsibility of the laboratory supervisor to ensure the SOP is
followed and the results are validated as per the procedure.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND HANDLING
• Specimen Type: Blood Spot on filter paper
• Specimen Stability: Blood spots must be dry and kept at room
temperature (15-25°C) and away from direct sunlight. The
specimens remain stable for up to 30 days.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Blood spots that are smeared or not fully saturated.
• Specimens exposed to moisture or not dried properly.
• Specimens without proper identification or collection details.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• LC-MS/MS system equipped with appropriate detection capability.
• Calibration standards for Hydroxyglutaric Acids, Glutaric Acid,
Ethylmalonic Acid, and Methylsuccinic Acid.
• Quality control samples.
• Methanol and other chromatography-grade solvents.
• Internal standard solutions.
• Filter paper punch.
• Centrifuge.
• Vials and caps.
4. PROCEDURE
Sample Preparation:
1. Collect blood spot using standard collection procedure on
designated filter paper.
2. Punch out disc from the dried blood spot using filter paper
punch.
3. Place the disc into a labeled vial.
4. Add a specified volume of methanol to the vial containing the
disc.
5. Add internal standard to the vial.
6. Vortex mix the vial for 30 seconds.
7. Centrifuge at high speed (10,000 rpm) for 5 minutes.
8. Transfer the supernatant to a clean vial and dilute further if
necessary.
Instrument Setup and Calibration:
1. Set up the LC-MS/MS system according to manufacturer
guidelines, ensuring proper calibration.
2. Prepare calibration standards covering the expected range of
analytes concentration in blood spot samples.
3. Inject calibration standards and record the response.
4. Establish calibration curve for each analyte.
Analysis:
1. Inject the prepared sample into the LC-MS/MS system.
2. Record retention times and peak area for each analyte.
3. Compare sample results against calibration curve to quantify
analyte concentration.
Quality Control:
1. Include internal QC samples with known concentrations in each
batch of analysis.
2. Review QC results to ensure they fall within the acceptable
range.
3. If QC results are outside acceptable ranges, troubleshoot the
LC-MS/MS system and rerun the sample batch.
Result Validation:
1. Validate results using QC criteria.
2. Cross-verify results using duplicate analysis.
3. Record final validated results in LIS.
5. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results must include concentration levels of Hydroxyglutaric
Acids, Glutaric Acid, Ethylmalonic Acid, and Methylsuccinic Acid.
• Report results following site-specific guidelines.
• In case of critical results, follow established procedures to notify
relevant healthcare personnel promptly.
6. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to LC-MS/MS manufacturer guidelines for specific
limitations.
• Elevated levels due to hemolysis or contamination are to be
noted.
7. REFERENCES
• LC-MS/MS system manufacturer’s manual.
• Relevant scientific literature on organic acidemias and blood spot
testing.
8. DOCUMENTATION
All procedural steps, calibration curves, QC results, and final analysis
results must be documented thoroughly and be available for review
during audits.
Note: This SOP must be reviewed periodically and updated
according to evolving laboratory practices and technological
advances. Ensure SOPs are approved and current before analysis.
