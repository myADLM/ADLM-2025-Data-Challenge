Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
ANALYTICAL PHASE: GENERATION OF RESULTS FOR
HYDROXYGLUTARIC ACIDS, GLUTARIC ACID, ETHYLMALONIC
ACID, AND METHYLSUCCINIC ACID, PLASMA
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the procedure for the analysis and generation of
results for 2-Hydroxyglutaric Acid, Glutaric Acid, Ethylmalonic Acid,
and Methylsuccinic Acid in plasma samples. The objective is to
ensure accurate, reliable, and reproducible results for clinical
diagnostics and patient care.
1. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all staff who are responsible for the analysis and
reporting of the aforementioned analytes in plasma samples within
the laboratory.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of trained laboratory staff to perform the
analysis, validate results, and report findings accurately. Supervisors
are responsible for the review and approval of results and adherence
to SOPs.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
4.1. Specimen Type
• Plasma
4.2. Collection and Handling
• Collect blood in a heparinized vacutainer (dark green top).
• Centrifuge the sample at 1500 x g for 10 minutes immediately
after collection.
• Aliquot the plasma into a clean, labeled polypropylene tube.
• Store the aliquoted plasma at -20°C until analysis.
4.3. Unacceptable Specimens
• Specimens received more than 48 hours after collection without
being frozen.
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
• Samples not stored or transported under the required temperature
conditions.
1. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system with UV/
Vis detection
• Analytical grade solvents (e.g., methanol, water)
• Internal standards specific to the analytes
• Mobile phase reagents
• Calibration standards for 2-Hydroxyglutaric Acid, Glutaric Acid,
Ethylmalonic Acid, and Methylsuccinic Acid
1. EQUIPMENT
• High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system
• Refrigerated centrifuge
• Pipettes and tips
• Sample vials and caps
• Analytical balance
1. PROCEDURE
7.1 Calibration and Quality Control
• Prepare calibration standards at appropriate concentrations for
each analyte.
• Run quality control samples at low, medium, and high
concentrations alongside patient samples.
7.2 Preparation of Samples
• Thaw frozen plasma samples at room temperature.
• Vortex samples to ensure homogeneity.
• Pipette a specified volume of plasma into a labeled HPLC sample
vial.
• Add internal standard and mobile phase to the plasma sample.
• Cap and briefly vortex the vial for mixing.
7.3 Chromatographic Conditions
• Set HPLC parameters according to the method development
summary for optimal separation of analytes.
• Column: C18 reverse-phase column
• Mobile phase: Gradient elution with methanol and water
• Flow rate: 1.0 mL/min
• Detection: UV at appropriate wavelengths for each analyte
7.4 Injection and Analysis
• Perform a system suitability test with a blank and calibration
standards.
• Inject standard calibrators, quality control samples, and patient
samples into the HPLC.
• Record the chromatograms and integrate peak areas for each
analyte.
7.5 Calculations and Data Analysis
• Generate calibration curves for each analyte by plotting peak area
versus concentration.
• Quantify the concentration of each analyte in the patient plasma
samples using the calibration curve.
• Calculate quality control sample concentrations and ensure they
are within the established range.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run quality control samples at the beginning and end of each
analytical run and after every 10 patient samples.
• Acceptable criteria for QC samples must be met before patient
results can be reported.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Verify that all quality control measures have been met.
• Enter the results into the laboratory information system (LIS).
• Review and validate the results with any flags for abnormal or
critical values noted.
• Communicate critical values to the appropriate clinical personnel
according to the lab’s protocol.
1. REFERENCES
• HPLC manufacturer's user manual and method development
guidelines.
• Relevant peer-reviewed articles on plasma analysis of the
specified organic acids.
• Laboratory quality control guidelines and documentation
standards.
1. DOCUMENTATION
• Maintain all records of calibrations, quality control results, sample
analyses, and corrective actions taken.
• Ensure all documentation is completed according to the
laboratory’s record-keeping policies.
1. SAFETY AND TROUBLESHOOTING
• Follow laboratory safety protocols for handling and disposing of
clinical specimens and reagents.
• Address any instrument malfunctions according to the
manufacturer's troubleshooting guide and, if necessary, seek
assistance from the instrument service provider.
This SOP is to be adhered to by all laboratory personnel involved in
the analysis of these analytes to ensure quality, accuracy, and
reliability of patient results.
