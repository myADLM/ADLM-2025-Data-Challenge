Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analysis of Hydroxyglutaric Acids, Glutaric Acid, Ethylmalonic
Acid, and Methylsuccinic Acid in Serum
1. PURPOSE
This standard operating procedure (SOP) outlines the protocol for the
analytical phase of quantifying hydroxyglutaric acids, glutaric acid,
ethylmalonic acid, and methylsuccinic acid in serum samples. These
compounds are critical for diagnosing and monitoring metabolic
disorders.
Responsibility: It is the responsibility of laboratory scientists and
analysts to perform the procedures as described and ensure that
equipment is properly maintained and calibrated. It is also their
responsibility to validate and document results according to this SOP.
1. SCOPE
This procedure is applicable to the analysis of serum samples using
gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS).
1. DEFINITIONS
Hydroxyglutaric Acids: Various forms of organic compounds involved
in certain metabolic pathways. Glutaric Acid: A dicarboxylic acid
important for diagnosing and monitoring glutaric aciduria.
Ethylmalonic Acid: An intermediate in various metabolic pathways,
significant for diagnosing metabolic disorders. Methylsuccinic Acid: A
compound involved in metabolism, whose abnormal levels can
indicate certain metabolic conditions.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Reagents and Equipment:
1. Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometer (GC-MS)
2. Serum samples
3. Internal standards (isotopically labeled analogs of target acids)
4. Organic solvents (e.g., ethyl acetate)
5. Derivatization reagents (e.g., N,O-
bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide, BSTFA)
6. Calibration standards
7. Quality control materials (both low and high concentration)
B. Sample Preparation:
1. Serum samples must be thawed and brought to room
temperature.
2. Precipitate proteins in the serum samples by adding 3 volumes
of cold methanol to 1 volume of serum and vortex for 2 minutes.
3. Centrifuge the mixture at 10,000 rpm for 10 minutes.
4. Transfer the supernatant to a clean centrifuge tube and
evaporate to dryness under a stream of nitrogen gas.
5. Reconstitute the dried residue in an appropriate volume of
water.
6. Prepare the samples for GC-MS analysis by derivatizing with
BSTFA at 70°C for 30 minutes.
C. GC-MS Analysis:
1. Calibrate the GC-MS with a series of known standards to
establish a calibration curve.
2. Inject an aliquot of each derivatized sample and standards into
the GC-MS.
3. Set the GC-MS parameters, including column temperature, flow
rates, and ion source conditions, following manufacturer
recommendations and the established laboratory method.
4. Analyze the chromatograms and mass spectra to identify and
quantify the target compounds.
5. Ensure that each batch of samples includes appropriate quality
control samples and internal standards.
D. Data Analysis and Reporting:
1. Calculate the concentration of each analyte in the serum
samples using the calibration curve.
2. Verify the results with internal standards and quality control
samples to ensure accuracy and precision.
3. Document the results in the laboratory information system
(LIS), including any flagged results that require additional
verification.
4. Results outside the reference intervals should be reviewed and
approved by a qualified personnel before reporting.
5. Report the final, verified results to the requesting healthcare
provider through the LIS.
E. Quality Control:
1. Run quality control samples at the beginning and end of each
analytical run to ensure the accuracy and precision of the
assay.
2. Verify GC-MS instrument performance regularly and document
maintenance activities.
3. Carry forward the internal QC standards for continuous
monitoring.
4. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS Laboratory personnel must
follow universal laboratory safety protocols, including the use of
personal protective equipment (PPE) such as lab coats, gloves,
and safety glasses. All chemical waste must be disposed of
according to the facility's hazardous waste procedures.
5. TROUBLESHOOTING If any aspect of the assay deviates from
the expected results:
6. Repeat sample preparation steps.
7. Recalibrate the GC-MS with fresh standards.
8. Inspect the instrument for any maintenance issues.
9. Consult with the designated supervisor for further guidance.
