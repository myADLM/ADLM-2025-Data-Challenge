Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analysis of
Hydroxyzine (Vistaril, Atarax) in Serum
1. PURPOSE
To outline the standard procedure for the analysis of Hydroxyzine
(Vistaril, Atarax) in serum samples using high-performance liquid
chromatography (HPLC) coupled with mass spectrometry (MS) or
another suitable method to ensure accurate and reproducible results.
Responsibility
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for following this
SOP and ensuring all steps are completed accurately. The supervisor
is responsible for oversight and addressing any issues that arise
during the analysis.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen Type:
• Serum
Collection Method:
• Collect blood in a serum separator tube (SST). Allow blood to clot
at room temperature for at least 30 minutes but no more than 1
hour. Spin the sample at 1500 to 2000 x g for 10 minutes at room
temperature. Carefully separate the serum from the clot.
Volume Required:
• Minimum: 1 mL of serum
Specimen Stability:
• Room Temperature: up to 24 hours
• Refrigerated (2-8°C): up to 72 hours
• Frozen (< -20°C): up to 6 months
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples
• Specimens collected in tubes containing anticoagulants (e.g.,
EDTA)
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system
• Mass spectrometer (MS) or an appropriate detector
• Centrifuge
• Calibrated pipettes
• Vortex mixer
Reagents:
• Mobile phase solvents (e.g., acetonitrile, water, formic acid)
• Hydroxyzine reference standard
• Internal standard (e.g., diphenhydramine)
• Calibration standards and QC materials
• Blank serum matrix
Supplies:
• HPLC vials and caps
• Syringes and filters
• Gloves and lab coat for safety
1. PROCEDURE
Preparation of Reagents and Solutions:
1. Mobile Phase: Prepare a mixture of acetonitrile and water
(containing 0.1% formic acid) in appropriate proportions (e.g.,
50:50 v/v).
2. Prepare calibration standards and quality controls in the blank
serum matrix at different concentrations (e.g., 10 ng/mL to 1000
ng/mL).
Sample Preparation:
1. Thaw frozen serum samples at room temperature.
2. Pipette 200 µL of serum sample into an HPLC vial.
3. Add an equal volume (200 µL) of the internal standard
(prepared in the same solvent as the mobile phase).
4. Vortex mix for 1 minute.
5. Centrifuge the mixture at 1500 x g for 10 minutes.
6. Transfer the supernatant to a clean HPLC vial for analysis.
Chromatographic Conditions:
1. Column: C18, 150 x 4.6 mm, 5 µm
2. Flow Rate: 1.0 mL/min
3. Injection Volume: 20 µL
4. Column Temperature: 25°C
5. Detection: Monitor the mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) for
Hydroxyzine and the internal standard using MS or a suitable
detector.
HPLC-MS Method:
1. Equilibrate the column with the mobile phase.
2. Inject calibration standards, QC samples, and serum samples.
3. Record retention times and peak areas.
4. Generate a calibration curve by plotting peak area ratios of
Hydroxyzine to the internal standard against known
concentrations.
5. Determine the concentration of Hydroxyzine in each serum
sample using the calibration curve.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
7. Run laboratory control samples (low, medium, high
concentrations) with each batch of patient samples to ensure
accuracy and precision.
8. Internal standards should yield consistent retention times and
peak areas.
9. Calibration standards should have a coefficient of determination
(R²) of at least 0.99.
10. QC results should be within ±15% of the nominal values.
11. REPORTING RESULTS
12. Verify and validate the assay results based on QC acceptance
criteria.
13. Any analytical runs failing QC must be repeated.
14. Report the Hydroxyzine concentration in ng/mL.
15. Flag and alert the clinician for any values outside the
therapeutic range.
Reference Interval:
• There are no universally established therapeutic reference ranges
for Hydroxyzine. Refer to relevant clinical literature or the
prescribing information for context.
1. LIMITATIONS
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples may interfere with the
analysis.
• Ensure all reagents are within their expiration date and stored
properly.
• Handle and dispose of hazardous chemicals per the laboratory
safety protocol.
