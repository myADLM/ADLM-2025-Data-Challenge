Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens that are hemolyzed, clotted, or improperly collected.
• Specimens not accompanied by proper documentation and
patient consent.
5. MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT
• DNA extraction kit
• Library preparation kit (specific to sequencing platform)
• Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) instrument (e.g., Illumina
MiSeq, NextSeq)
• PCR thermal cycler
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes and tips
• Nuclease-free water
• Qubit Fluorometer or equivalent for DNA quantification
• Agilent Bioanalyzer or equivalent for library quality control
• Bioinformatics tools and software for sequence data analysis
6. PROCEDURE
6.1 DNA Extraction:
1. Blood a. Centrifuge the EDTA/ACD blood sample at 2500 x g
for 10 minutes. b. Using a pipette, carefully extract the buffy
coat layer. c. Proceed with the DNA extraction using the kit
according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
2. Saliva a. Use the saliva collection kit to transfer the sample to a
processing tube. b. Follow the DNA extraction protocol provided
by the kit manufacturer.
6.2 Library Preparation:
1. DNA Quantification a. Measure the concentration of extracted
DNA using the Qubit Fluorometer. b. Check DNA purity by
measuring the 260/280 ratio.
2. Library Construction a. Prepare DNA libraries using the
library preparation kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
b. Check the quality and size distribution of the libraries using
the Agilent Bioanalyzer. c. Normalize library concentrations to
meet sequencing platform requirements.
6.3 Sequencing:
1. Loading Samples a. Load the prepared libraries onto the
sequencing instrument according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. b. Start the sequencing run and monitor for any
issues.
6.4 Data Analysis:
1. Initial Data Processing a. Import raw sequencing data into the
bioinformatics pipeline. b. Perform sequence alignment to the
human reference genome. c. Call variants and generate a
variant call format (VCF) file.
2. Variant Filtering and Annotation a. Filter variants based on
frequency, quality, and relevant databases. b. Annotate variants
with pathogenicity predictions and clinical significance using
appropriate software tools.
6.5 Interpretation and Reporting:
1. Variant Interpretation a. Review filtered and annotated
variants to determine their potential role in Hyper-IgE
Syndrome. b. Classify variants according to ACMG guidelines.
2. Report Generation a. Compile a comprehensive report
including patient information, methodological details, identified
variants, interpretation, and clinical relevance. b. Review and
verify the report by laboratory supervisor before final approval.
3. Result Reporting a. Transmit the final report to the ordering
clinician via the LIS. b. Retain a copy of the report in the
patient’s laboratory record.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
1. DNA Extraction QC a. Verify the quality and quantity of
isolated DNA.
2. Library Preparation QC a. Assess the library quality and
concentration before sequencing.
3. Sequencing QC a. Ensure quality metrics (e.g., coverage
depth, read quality) are met. b. Include appropriate positive and
negative controls in each run.
4. Bioinformatics QC a. Validate bioinformatics pipelines with
known standards.
