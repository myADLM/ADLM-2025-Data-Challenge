Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase for Hypercholesterolemia Gene Panel
Purpose:
To outline the procedure for generating results for
hypercholesterolemia gene panel testing from accessioned
specimens, ensuring consistency, accuracy, and quality control.
1. Specimen Requirements
• Preferred Specimen: EDTA whole blood or saliva.
• Volume Requirements: Minimum of 2-5 mL blood or 1 mL saliva.
• Stability: Blood specimens: stable up to 7 days at 4°C; Saliva: up
to 14 days at room temperature.
2. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies
• PCR machines
• Nucleic acid extraction kits (e.g., QIAamp DNA Mini Kit)
• Hypercholesterolemia gene panel assay reagents
• Pipettes and tips
• Microcentrifuge tubes
• PCR reaction tubes
• Gloves and lab coats
3. Nucleic Acid Extraction Procedure
1. Whole Blood/Saliva Preparation:
◦ Mix specimen thoroughly.
◦ Centrifuge blood at 1500 x g for 10 minutes to separate
plasma, if required.
◦ Transfer 200 µL of sample to a microcentrifuge tube,
ensuring a clean and well-labelled working area.
2. DNA Extraction:
◦ Use the appropriate DNA extraction kit according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
◦ Elute DNA in 50-100 µL of elution buffer.
◦ Confirm DNA quality and quantity using spectrophotometry
(A260/A280 ratio).
4. PCR Amplification and Sequencing
1. PCR Setup:
◦ Prepare master mix containing:
▪ PCR buffer,
▪ dNTP mix,
▪ Forward and reverse primers,
▪ DNA polymerase,
◦ Distribute 20 µL of master mix into each PCR tube.
◦ Add 5 µL of extracted DNA to the tubes.
2. Thermal Cycling:
◦ Thermal cycler conditions:
▪ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 3 minutes
▪ 35 cycles of:
▪ Denaturation: 95°C for 30 seconds
▪ Annealing: 60°C for 30 seconds
▪ Extension: 72°C for 1 minute
▪ Final extension: 72°C for 5 minutes
◦ Verify amplification by running a sample on a 1.5% agarose
gel.
5. Sequencing
1. Set Up Sequencing Reaction:
◦ Prepare sequencing master mix according to the
sequencing protocol.
◦ Add PCR product (amplicon) to the sequencing mix.
◦ Use appropriate sequencing instruments and software.
6. Data Analysis
1. Raw Data Generation:
◦ Generate raw sequence data files from the sequencing
instrument.
◦ Verify the QC metrics of each run.
2. Data Interpretation:
◦ Use bioinformatics software tools to analyze sequence data.
◦ Compare analyzed sequence data against known
hypercholesterolemia gene mutations.
3. Verification:
◦ Verify identified mutations via a secondary analysis
program.
◦ Any ambiguous results must be re-sequenced.
7. Quality Control
1. Internal Quality Control:
◦ Run positive and negative controls alongside samples
during PCR and sequencing.
◦ Ensure controls meet expected results.
2. Reagent and Equipment Validation:
◦ Validate new batches of PCR reagents and sequencing kits
through parallel testing.
◦ Perform routine maintenance and calibration of PCR
machines and sequencers.
3. Troubleshooting:
◦ Address any anomalies detected during amplification or
sequencing.
◦ Consult with supervisors before rerunning samples.
8. Result Reporting
1. Documentation:
◦ Record and log results according to SOP.
◦ Complete the QC checklist log for each run.
2. Result Interpretation:
◦ Generate a comprehensive report detailing detected gene
mutations.
◦ Include recommendations for further testing or clinical
action.
3. Verification and Approval:
◦ Review results by a senior technologist/clinical geneticist.
◦ Approve and release results through the laboratory
information system (LIS).
