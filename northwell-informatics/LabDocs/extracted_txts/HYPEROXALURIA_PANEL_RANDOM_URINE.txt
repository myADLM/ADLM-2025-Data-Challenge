Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) HYPEROXALURIA PANEL,
RANDOM, URINE
1. PURPOSE To provide a standardized procedure for the
analytical phase of generating results for HYPEROXALURIA
PANEL, RANDOM, URINE to ensure accuracy, reliability, and
consistency in test results.
Responsibility: It is the responsibility of the laboratory staff to perform
this procedure correctly and ensure accurate results. The supervisor
must ensure adherence to this SOP and handle any procedural
issues.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred Specimen: Random urine sample
• Volume: Minimum of 10 mL of urine
• Specimen Storage: Store at 2-8°C if not processed immediately. If
specimens are expected to be stored for more than 72 hours,
freeze them at -20°C.
• Unacceptable Specimens:
◦ Specimens received in the lab more than 72 hours after
collection if not previously frozen
◦ Specimens without proper labeling or requisition information
◦ Specimens contaminated with feces
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Centrifuge
• Disposable pipettes
• Urine specimen containers
• Analytical balance
• Oxalate reagents
• Creatinine reagents
• Refractometer for specific gravity
• Multi-well plate
• Spectrophotometer
1. PROCEDURE A. Sample Preparation:
2. Ensure that the specimen container is properly labeled with
patient information, date, and time of collection.
3. Allow the urine specimen to reach room temperature if it was
refrigerated.
4. Mix the specimen well by gently swirling the container.
B. Centrifugation:
1. Transfer 5 mL of urine into a centrifuge tube.
2. Centrifuge the sample at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes to remove
debris and cells.
3. Carefully transfer the clear supernatant to a clean container.
C. Quantification:
1. Measure specific gravity using a refractometer to ensure the
specimen is within the acceptable range (1.005–1.030).
Document the value.
2. Load 100 µL of centrifuged urine into the wells of the multi-well
plate for oxalate and creatinine assays.
D. Oxalate Assay:
1. Prepare oxalate reagent as per manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Add the required volume of oxalate reagent to the urine in the
multi-well plate.
3. Incubate the mixture at 37°C for 30 minutes.
4. Measure the absorbance at the designated wavelength using a
spectrophotometer.
5. Calculate oxalate concentration using the standard curve.
E. Creatinine Assay:
1. Prepare creatinine reagent as per manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Add the required volume of creatinine reagent to the urine in
the multi-well plate.
3. Incubate the mixture according to the reagent instructions.
4. Measure the absorbance at the designated wavelength using a
spectrophotometer.
5. Calculate creatinine concentration using the standard curve.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run quality control samples (low, medium, and high
concentrations) alongside patient specimens with each batch to
verify assay accuracy.
• Document all quality control results. Investigate and resolve any
out-of-range values before proceeding with patient samples.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Calculate the oxalate-to-creatinine ratio for each sample.
• Document results in the laboratory information system (LIS) in
compliance with site-specific reporting guidelines.
• Flag any critical results according to laboratory policy and inform
the appropriate clinical staff promptly.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Oxalate: 0.11–0.46 mmol/mmol creatinine (for age-specific
reference intervals, refer to established laboratory reference
ranges)
• Specific gravity: 1.005–1.030
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Ensure specimens are free from protein, blood, and other
contaminants that may interfere with the assays.
• Highly alkaline or acidic specimens may require pH adjustment
before analysis.
