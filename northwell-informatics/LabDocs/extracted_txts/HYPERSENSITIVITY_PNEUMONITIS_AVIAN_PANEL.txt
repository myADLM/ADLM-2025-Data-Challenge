SOP: ANALYTICAL PROCEDURE FOR
HYPERSENSITIVITY PNEUMONITIS AVIAN PANEL
1. PURPOSE To outline the standard operating procedure for
performing the analytical phase of the Hypersensitivity
Pneumonitis (HP) Avian Panel for accurate detection of
antibodies associated with avian hypersensitivity pneumonitis in
human serum samples.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of the trained laboratory scientists to perform
this procedure as outlined and to ensure all steps are documented
and followed as per laboratory standards.
1. PRINCIPLE The Avian Panel test involves the detection of
specific antibodies against avian antigens to aid in the
diagnosis of hypersensitivity pneumonitis caused by avian
exposure. This procedure typically employs enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) techniques.
2. SPECIMEN
◦ Preferred/Acceptable: Serum from a properly labeled red-
top or serum separator tube (SST).
◦ Unacceptable: Hemolyzed, lipemic, or improperly labeled
specimens. Specimens stored for more than 7 days at 2-8°C
(refrigerated) or previously frozen and thawed more than
once.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
◦ ELISA reader and washer
◦ Microtiter plates coated with avian antigens
◦ Calibrators, controls, and samples
◦ Wash buffer
◦ Diluent
◦ Conjugate solution
◦ Substrate solution (e.g., TMB)
◦ Stop solution (e.g., sulfuric acid)
◦ Pipettes and tips
◦ Absorbent paper
4. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation:
◦ Ensure all reagents and samples are at room temperature
before starting the procedure.
◦ Calibrate the ELISA reader and ensure all equipment is in
working order.
◦ Prepare the working solutions as per the manufacturer's
instructions.
B. Assay Steps:
1. Sample and Control Addition:
▪ Label the required number of microtiter wells for
samples, controls, and calibrators.
▪ Add 100 µL of each control, calibrator, and diluted
serum sample into the designated wells.
2. Incubation:
▪ Incubate the microtiter plate for the specified time at
room temperature (typically 30-60 minutes), avoiding
exposure to direct sunlight.
3. Washing:
▪ Wash the wells thoroughly with the wash buffer. Use
an ELISA washer if available. Follow the
manufacturer's recommendation for the number of
washes (usually 3-5 washes).
4. Conjugate Addition:
▪ Add 100 µL of conjugate solution to each well.
▪ Incubate the plate again for the specified time.
5. Washing:
▪ Repeat the washing step as described above.
6. Substrate Addition:
▪ Add 100 µL of substrate solution to each well.
▪ Incubate the plate in the dark for the specified time
until the color develops (typically 10-30 minutes).
7. Stopping Reaction:
▪ Add 50 µL of stop solution to each well to halt the
enzymatic reaction. This will change the color of the
substrate.
8. Reading the Plate:
▪ Read the absorbance of each well in the ELISA reader
at the appropriate wavelength (commonly 450nm with
a reference filter of 620-630nm).
5. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Run both positive and negative controls with every batch of
tests conducted.
◦ Ensure that the control results fall within the specified range
provided by the manufacturer.
◦ Document all control results on the Quality Control log and
review for trends or deviations.
6. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
◦ Calculate the sample values based on the absorbance
reading using the ELISA reader's software or manual
methods provided in the assay kit insert.
◦ Interpret results based on the cut-off values and reference
ranges provided in the manufacturer’s instruction.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ Generate and verify results according to laboratory’s LIS
(Laboratory Information System)
◦ Report results as negative, borderline, or positive, based on
the calculated values and reference ranges.
8. TROUBLESHOOTING
◦ If control values fall outside of the expected range, do not
report patient results. Investigate possible reasons such as
reagent issues or equipment malfunction, and take
corrective action.
◦ Document any troubleshooting actions taken and any
deviations from the SOP.
9. REFERENCES
◦ Manufacturer's instructions and package insert for the
specific ELISA kit used.
◦ Laboratory Quality Assurance and Control Guidelines.
10. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS
◦ Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) at all
times.
◦ Follow biosafety protocols for handling and disposing of
biohazard materials.
◦ Ensure that the laboratory fume hood and all workstation
surfaces are decontaminated before and after the
procedure.
This SOP is intended to ensure clarity and uniformity in the testing
procedure to generate high-quality and reliable results for the
Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis Avian Panel. All personnel must be
trained and demonstrate competency in this procedure.
