STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE HYPERSENSITIVITY
PNEUMONITIS PANEL
1. PURPOSE
To establish a standardized procedure for the analytical phase of the
Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis (HP) Panel in order to generate
accurate and reliable results. This procedure ensures that results are
obtained, analyzed, and reported with consistency and precision.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all staff members who are qualified to
perform and interpret tests related to the Hypersensitivity
Pneumonitis Panel within the laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of designated laboratory technicians and
technologists to perform the procedures as outlined. The laboratory
supervisors are responsible for overseeing the adherence to this
protocol and for addressing any discrepancies or issues that arise.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Serum or plasma
• Collection: Blood should be drawn using standard venipuncture
technique.
• Container: Use serum separator tubes (SST) or plasma tubes
with appropriate anticoagulant (preferably EDTA).
• Volume: Minimum 3 mL of blood.
• Handling: Ensure specimens are properly mixed (for plasma
samples) and centrifuged to separate the serum/plasma within 2
hours of collection.
• Storage: Store specimens at 2-8°C if analysis is to occur within 72
hours. For long-term storage, freeze specimens at -20°C or
below.
• Rejection Criteria: Hemolysis, lipemia, inappropriate
anticoagulant, insufficient volume, improper labeling, or collection
outside the specified time frame.
5. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) reader
• Microplate Washer
• Micropipettes and tips
• Reagents specific to the Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis Panel
• Calibrators and controls for the assay
6. PROCEDURE
6.1 Preparation
• Ensure that all reagents and specimens have reached room
temperature before starting the assay.
• Label all microtiter plate wells clearly.
• Prepare reagents according to manufacturer guidelines.
6.2 Sample Loading
• Pipette 100 µL of each calibrator, control, and patient sample into
the designated wells.
• Ensure no bubbles are present in the wells.
• Cover the microtiter plate with a sealing film or lid to prevent
evaporation.
6.3 Incubation
• Incubate the plate at the temperature and for the time specified in
the reagent instructions (typically 30-60 minutes) to allow antigen-
antibody reactions.
6.4 Washing
• Wash the wells thoroughly with the appropriate washing buffer as
specified. Typically, this involves several cycles of filling and
aspirating the wells to remove unbound substances.
• Ensure no residual liquid is left after the final wash.
6.5 Detection
• Add 100 µL of enzyme-conjugated secondary antibody to each
well.
• Incubate the plate for the specified time and temperature.
• Wash the plate again to remove unbound conjugate.
6.6 Color Development
• Add the appropriate substrate solution (e.g., TMB) to each well.
• Incubate in the dark for the specified time or until the color
development is sufficient.
• Add the stop solution to halt the reaction.
6.7 Reading and Analysis
• Place the microtiter plate in the ELISA reader.
• Measure absorbance at the recommended wavelength (typically
450 nm).
• Record the optical density (OD) values for each well.
6.8 Calculations
• Construct a standard curve using the OD values of the calibrators.
• Determine the concentration of antibodies in patient samples by
comparing their OD values to the standard curve.
• Ensure quality control by verifying that control values fall within
the specified range.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run both a positive and negative control with each batch of tests
to ensure assay performance.
• If control results are outside of the acceptable range, troubleshoot
potential issues, including reagent integrity, equipment function,
and procedural errors.
• Document all findings and corrective actions taken.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results are to be reviewed by a qualified technologist.
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS) along
with any pertinent comments or observations.
• Verify that results meet acceptability criteria before reporting.
• In case of critical values or unexpected results, notify the
responsible physician immediately as per the Critical Results
Reporting protocol.
9. MAINTENANCE
• Follow routine maintenance schedules for all equipment involved
in the assay.
• Document any service or calibration performed on the equipment.
10. TROUBLESHOOTING
• Common issues such as background noise, inconsistent control
results, or calibration errors should be addressed according to the
troubleshooting guide provided by the reagent manufacturer.
• Consult the laboratory supervisor for persistent or unresolved
issues.
11. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's instructions for the Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis
Panel.
• Laboratory’s quality control and maintenance protocols.
• Relevant clinical guidelines for the interpretation and clinical
significance of the Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis Panel.
12. DOCUMENTATION
• Record all sample details, assay conditions, and results in the
corresponding lab logs.
• Maintain all records for the retention period as per laboratory
policy.
This protocol ensures a standardized approach to accurately
generating and reporting results for the Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis
Panel. Adherence to this SOP is crucial for maintaining high-quality
laboratory practices.
