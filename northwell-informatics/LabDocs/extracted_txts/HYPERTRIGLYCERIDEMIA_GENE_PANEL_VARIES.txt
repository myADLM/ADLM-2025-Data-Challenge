Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Hypertriglyceridemia Gene Panel
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this SOP is to outline the detailed
procedure for conducting the Hypertriglyceridemia Gene Panel
analysis. This includes steps for DNA extraction, library
preparation, sequencing, data analysis, and result generation.
The aim is to ensure accurate, reliable and timely diagnosis of
hypertriglyceridemia resulting from genetic mutations.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
◦ Laboratory personnel performing the analysis are
responsible for adherence to this SOP.
◦ The lab supervisor is responsible for ensuring compliance,
overseeing the workflow, and addressing any issues or
discrepancies that arise during the analysis.
3. DEFINITIONS
◦ Hypertriglyceridemia: A condition characterized by elevated
levels of triglycerides in the blood.
◦ Gene Panel: A set of genes associated with a particular
condition that are analyzed together.
◦ DNA Library: A collection of DNA fragments prepared for
sequencing.
◦ Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS): A high-throughput
method used to determine the sequence of nucleotides in
DNA.
4. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation
◦ DNA Extraction:
1. Extract genomic DNA from the patients' blood or other
provided specimen using the laboratory’s standard
extraction method.
2. Quantify DNA using a fluorometric method (e.g.,
Qubit).
3. Assess purity using a spectrophotometer (e.g.,
NanoDrop).
4. Store DNA at -20°C until further processing.
B. Library Preparation 1. Prepare the DNA library using a
commercially available kit designed for NGS, following the
manufacturer’s instructions. 2. Perform library quantification
and quality control using an appropriate method (e.g.,
Bioanalyzer, TapeStation). 3. If necessary, normalize the library
concentration to ensure uniform sample loading on the
sequencer.
C. Sequencing 1. Load the prepared library into the
sequencing instrument (e.g., Illumina MiSeq, NextSeq). 2. Run
sequencing according to the instrument’s operational protocol.
D. Data Analysis 1. Use on-instrument software for initial data
processing. 2. Transfer the sequencing data to bioinformatics
pipelines for comprehensive analysis. 3. Perform quality control
checks on raw data to assess read depth, base quality, and
other relevant metrics. 4. Align reads to the reference genome.
5. Call variants using appropriate software (e.g., GATK,
VarDict). 6. Annotate variants using databases such as ClinVar,
HGMD, and others.
E. Result Interpretation 1. Review and interpret the variant
data in the context of known associations with
hypertriglyceridemia. 2. If necessary, validate key findings using
an independent method such as Sanger sequencing.
F. Result Reporting 1. Generate a comprehensive report
detailing the genetic findings and their clinical significance. 2.
Double-check the report for accuracy and completeness. 3.
Inform the ordering physician of the availability of the results. 4.
Include recommendations for follow-up testing or clinical
consultation if needed.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Regularly perform quality control steps such as running
known control samples to ensure accuracy of the
sequencing and data analysis processes.
◦ Document all quality control procedures and outcomes, and
address any discrepancies.
6. REFERENCES
◦ Manufacturer protocols for DNA extraction kits, library
preparation kits, and sequencing instruments.
◦ Bioinformatics software manuals and guidelines.
◦ Relevant clinical guidelines and literature for interpreting
hypertriglyceridemia-associated variants.
Note: Always adhere to relevant Laboratory Safety Guidelines and
ensure compliance with Clinical Laboratory Improvement
Amendments (CLIA) regulations.
