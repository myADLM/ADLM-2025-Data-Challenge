Standard Operating Procedure Analytical Phase: Hypertrophic
Cardiomyopathy Gene Panel Analysis
1. PURPOSE
To accurately detect pathogenic variants associated with
Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM) through the analysis of a gene
panel. This SOP outlines the steps necessary for the extraction,
amplification, sequencing, and interpretation of genetic material to
identify relevant mutations.
Responsibility:
Designated clinical laboratory technologists will perform all steps in
the procedure, document results, and report findings. It is the
responsibility of all staff to identify any incidental findings that may
affect the analysis and reporting and to bring them to the attention of
a supervisor. Staff and supervisors are responsible for ensuring all
steps are performed accurately, including the execution of any
corrective actions if required.
1. DEFINITION
Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a genetic condition
characterized by abnormal thickening of the heart muscle, which can
lead to complications such as arrhythmia and congestive heart
failure. The gene panel includes analysis of genes such as MYH7,
MYBPC3, TNNT2, TNNI3, and others known to be related to HCM.
1. PROCEDURE
A. DNA Extraction
Collect specimen (assumed already collected, received, and
accessioned). Extract genomic DNA from the specimen using an
appropriate extraction kit following the manufacturer's instructions.
Quantify and assess the quality of the extracted DNA using
spectrophotometric analysis (e.g., Nanodrop) and gel
electrophoresis. Store extracted DNA at -20°C until further
processing.
B. Target Amplification
Select the gene panel for HCM including specific exons and regions
of interest. Perform PCR amplification of the target regions using
gene-specific primers and a high-fidelity polymerase. Use thermal
cycling conditions optimized for the primer set. Confirm the quality
and size of amplifications through agarose gel electrophoresis.
C. Library Preparation for Sequencing
Quantify PCR products using fluorometric methods (e.g., Qubit).
Perform the necessary steps to prepare the sequencing library
according to chosen Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) platform
instructions (e.g., Illumina). Ensure proper adapter ligation, clean-up,
and quantification steps. Pool libraries accordingly if multiplexing.
D. Next-Generation Sequencing
Load the prepared libraries into the sequencer following the
manufacturer's instructions. Run the sequencing protocol optimized
for the HCM gene panel. Monitor the sequencing run for quality
metrics and take necessary action if deviations occur.
E. Data Analysis and Interpretation
Use bioinformatics tools to align sequence data to a reference
genome and identify variants. Apply variant calling algorithms to
detect single nucleotide variants (SNVs), insertions, deletions, and
copy number variations relevant to HCM. Filter variants based on
quality metrics and clinical significance. Review detected variants
against databases (e.g., ClinVar) for pathogenicity known
associations with HCM.
F. Results Validation and Quality Control
Each detected variant will be confirmed through Sanger sequencing
for validation. Compare the results against previously published data
and internal controls. Quality control checks must include running
controls during each experimental batch to ensure reliability and
repeatability. Document all findings in laboratory information
management systems (LIMS).
G. Reporting Results
Generate a comprehensive report detailing identified variants, their
clinical significance, and recommendations. Review and verify the
report by a senior clinical scientist or geneticist. Transmit results to
the ordering physician through secure electronic medical records
(EMR).
H. Corrective Actions
If discrepancies or errors are noted during any phase of the
procedure: Review and re-run the affected steps if necessary.
Document all actions taken including the root cause analysis and
corrective measures. Inform the supervisor and relevant stakeholder
about the error and corrective actions.
1. Reference Intervals:
The interpretation of variant pathogenicity will be based on
established databases including ClinVar, dbSNP, and literature
review.
1. Method Limitations:
The NGS panel may not detect all mutations associated with HCM.
Large structural variants, low coverage regions, and variants in non-
targeted areas are potential limitations. Biological interpretation
should be corroborated by clinical information.
