Standard Operating Procedure
(SOP) for Generating Results
for
HYPOBETALIPOPROTEINEMIA
GENE PANEL, VARIES
1. PURPOSE
To establish a standardized protocol for performing the analytical
phase of generating results for the Hypobetalipoproteinemia Gene
Panel, ensuring accuracy, consistency, and reliability in patient
testing.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel performing the
Hypobetalipoproteinemia Gene Panel in the CLIA-certified laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
All laboratory personnel are responsible for adhering to this SOP
when performing the Hypobetalipoproteinemia Gene Panel. The
designated supervisor is responsible for verifying the results and
ensuring that the protocol is followed correctly.
4. DEFINITIONS
• Hypobetalipoproteinemia Gene Panel: A test that evaluates
multiple genes associated with hypobetalipoproteinemia – a rare
genetic disorder characterized by low levels of low-density
lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C).
• Specimen: Extracted DNA obtained from patient blood samples
previously collected, received, and accessioned by the laboratory.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND
SUPPLIES
• PCR machine or NGS platform (Next Generation Sequencing
platform)
• DNA extraction kit
• Hypobetalipoproteinemia Gene Panel reagents
• Pipettes and sterile tips
• Thermal cycler
• Sequencing reagents and chips
• Bioinformatics analysis software
6. PROCEDURE
A) DNA Extraction
1. Prepare the Workstation: Clean and sterilize the workstation
and ensure all necessary equipment and reagents are
available.
2. Extract DNA: Follow the DNA extraction kit instructions to
isolate DNA from patient blood samples. Ensure that the
extracted DNA meets the required concentration and purity
standards.
3. DNA Quality Control: Measure DNA concentration and purity
using a spectrophotometer or fluorometer. Document the
results in the DNA Quality Control Log.
4. Store DNA: Store the extracted DNA at the appropriate
temperature until further use.
B) Gene Panel Amplification
1. Prepare PCR Reaction Mixture: Prepare the Reaction Mixture
according to the Hypobetalipoproteinemia Gene Panel protocol.
Include all necessary primers and reagents.
2. Load Samples: Pipette the required amount of extracted DNA
into each reaction tube or plate well containing the PCR
mixture.
3. Run PCR: Place the reaction tubes or plate into the thermal
cycler. Program the cycler according to the recommended PCR
conditions for the Hypobetalipoproteinemia Gene Panel.
4. PCR Quality Control: After the PCR run, assess the
amplification quality through gel electrophoresis or another
appropriate method.
C) Sequencing
1. Prepare Sequencing Library: According to the gene panel kit
instructions, prepare the sequencing library from the PCR
products. Normalize and purify the library as required.
2. Load Sequencing Platform: Load the sequencing reagents
and prepared library into the sequencing instrument (NGS
platform) as per the instrument’s instructions.
3. Run Sequencing: Initiate the sequencing run and monitor the
progress to completion.
D) Analysis
1. Data Export: After completion of the sequencing run, export the
raw data generated by the sequencer.
2. Data Analysis: Utilize bioinformatics software to align
sequences to reference genomes, call variants, and annotate
the results. Ensure the software parameters are correctly
configured for Hypobetalipoproteinemia Gene Panel analysis.
3. Review Results: Ensure that the variant calls and annotations
are consistent with the protocols outlined by the panel
guidelines. Identify known pathogenic variants or variants of
uncertain significance.
4. Interpreting Results: Refer to clinical databases and literature
for interpreting pathogenicity of gene variants identified. Consult
with a geneticist for interpretation as necessary.
E) Reporting Results
1. Draft Report: Prepare a comprehensive report that includes
identified variants, their clinical significance, and potential
clinical implications.
2. Review and Verification: The report must be reviewed and
verified by a qualified professional for accuracy and
completeness before release to the clinician.
3. Result Communication: Results must be communicated to the
requesting healthcare provider in accordance with laboratory
reporting guidelines. Critical findings should be communicated
promptly.
7. QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE
• Perform regular maintenance and calibration of all equipment
involved in the process.
• Include positive and negative controls in each PCR and
sequencing run to ensure the validity of results.
• Regularly review and update the gene panel database with new
findings and recommended guidelines.
8. RECORD KEEPING
Maintain all records including DNA extraction results, PCR run data,
sequencing data, and final reports in accordance with the laboratory’s
document retention policy.
