Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Hypoglycemic Agent
Screen, Serum
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the procedure to be followed for the analytical
phase of generating results for the Hypoglycemic Agent Screen in
serum samples. The aim is to ensure the accurate and timely
analysis of hypoglycemic agents to support clinical treatment.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory staff are responsible for conducting the
analyses, documenting the results, and performing quality control
procedures.
• Laboratory supervisors are responsible for ensuring that staff
follow this SOP and for addressing any issues that arise during
analysis.
2. DEFINITION
Hypoglycemic agents are substances used to lower blood glucose
levels, often administered to patients with diabetes mellitus.
3. PROCEDURE
A) EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES:
• High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) or Liquid
Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) system
• Hypoglycemic agent standards and calibration solutions
• Control materials – negative and positive controls
• Mobile phase solvents (e.g., acetonitrile, water, formic acid)
• Serum sample collection supplies
• Sample preparation materials (e.g., protein precipitation reagents,
extraction solvents)
• Filtration devices
• Sample vials
B) SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS:
Preferred/Acceptable: Serum samples collected in appropriate tubes
(e.g., SST - serum separation tube) and processed to separate
serum within 2 hours. Serum stored at -20°C or lower until analysis.
Unacceptable: Samples that are hemolyzed, lipemic, or have been
improperly stored.
C) DETAILED PROCEDURE:
1. Sample Preparation:
◦ Thaw the serum samples at room temperature.
◦ Vortex mix the samples to ensure homogeneity.
◦ Add an appropriate volume of protein precipitation reagent
to the serum sample.
▪ e.g., 200 µL of acetonitrile to 100 µL of serum.
◦ Vortex mix for 1 minute.
◦ Centrifuge the mixture at 10,000 x g for 10 minutes at 4°C.
◦ Transfer the clear supernatant to a clean tube, avoiding the
pellet.
◦ Filter the supernatant using a 0.2 µm filter into an HPLC/LC-
MS/MS vial.
2. HPLC/LC-MS/MS Setup:
◦ Ensure the HPLC/LC-MS/MS system is calibrated and
operational.
◦ Prepare mobile phase reagents per instrument guidelines.
◦ Flush the HPLC/LC-MS/MS system with the mobile phase
before use.
◦ Load the prepared samples, calibration standards, and
controls onto the instrument.
3. Analysis:
◦ Run a method validation sequence, ensuring calibration
standards and controls are analyzed first.
◦ Implement the programmed run sequence for samples on
the HPLC/LC-MS/MS system.
◦ Monitor the system for any alarms or errors during the run.
4. Data Acquisition:
◦ Ensure proper integration of peaks using the software
provided with the HPLC/LC-MS/MS system.
◦ Identify the hypoglycemic agents based on retention times
and mass spectral data (for LC-MS/MS).
◦ Compare sample peaks to those of the standards for
quantification.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run quality control samples (negative and positive) with each
batch of samples to validate the assay.
• If controls do not meet predefined acceptance criteria, investigate
the cause, take appropriate corrective actions, and do not
proceed with reporting patient results until the issue is resolved.
• Document all QC results and corrective actions.
5. REPORTING RESULTS
• Transmit results automatically from the HPLC/LC-MS/MS system
to the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Review and verify results for accuracy and consistency.
• Report results in accordance with laboratory policies.
6. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Negative: No detectable hypoglycemic agents.
7. SPECIMEN REJECTION CRITERIA
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or contaminated samples.
• Samples not processed or stored as per procedures.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to instrument-specific documentation for limitations relating
to sensitivity, specificity, and potential interferences.
