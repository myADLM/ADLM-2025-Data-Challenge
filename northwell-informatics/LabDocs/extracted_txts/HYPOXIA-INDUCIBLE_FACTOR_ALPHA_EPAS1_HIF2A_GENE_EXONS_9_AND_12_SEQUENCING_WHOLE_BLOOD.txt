Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for HYPOXIA-INDUCIBLE
FACTOR ALPHA (EPAS1/HIF2A) GENE, EXONS 9 AND 12
SEQUENCING, WHOLE BLOOD
1. PURPOSE
To provide standardized procedures for the sequencing of exons 9
and 12 of the Hypoxia-Inducible Factor Alpha (EPAS1/HIF2A) gene in
whole blood specimens. This protocol ensures the accuracy and
reliability of test results.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel responsible for the
sequencing of the EPAS1/HIF2A gene. It details the steps from DNA
extraction to result interpretation for specimens that have been
collected, received, and accessioned.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the laboratory personnel to follow this SOP
and the applicable laboratory standards to ensure precise and
accurate testing. Laboratory supervisors are responsible for the
training and oversight of the personnel and for ensuring compliance
with this SOP.

6. PROCEDURE
6.1 DNA Extraction:
• Use an appropriate DNA extraction kit to isolate genomic DNA
from whole blood.
• Quantify and assess the quality of the extracted DNA using a
NanoDrop spectrophotometer and agarose gel electrophoresis.
• The DNA concentration should be ideally between 20-100 ng/µL
with a 260/280 ratio of 1.8-2.0.
6.2 PCR Amplification:
• Prepare PCR reactions for exons 9 and 12 of the EPAS1 gene
using specific primers: Exon 9 Forward Primer: [specific
sequence] Exon 9 Reverse Primer: [specific sequence] Exon 12
Forward Primer: [specific sequence] Exon 12 Reverse Primer:
[specific sequence]
• PCR conditions: Initial denaturation: 95°C for 5 minutes
Denaturation: 95°C for 30 seconds Annealing: 58-63°C for 30
seconds (optimize for specific primers) Extension: 72°C for 1
minute Final extension: 72°C for 7 minutes Hold: 4°C
6.3 PCR Product Purification:
• Purify the PCR products using a suitable PCR purification kit
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
• Verify the purified products on an agarose gel to confirm the
correct amplicon size.
6.4 Sequencing:
• Prepare sequencing reactions using purified PCR products and
sequencing primers.
• Perform sequencing using a DNA sequencer according to the
manufacturer's protocol.
6.5 Sequence Analysis:
• Analyze sequencing data using bioinformatics tools.
• Compare sequences obtained to the reference EPAS1/HIF2A
gene sequences to identify possible mutations and variations.
6.6 Reporting Results:
• Document sequence variations and mutations detected in the
laboratory information system (LIS).
• Verify and interpret results in the context of clinical findings.
• Generate a detailed report to be reviewed by a laboratory
supervisor prior to release.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
7.1 DNA Extraction Control:
• Include a positive control DNA sample and a negative (no-
template) control with each batch of extractions.
7.2 PCR Control:
• Include both positive and negative controls in each PCR run to
ensure amplification efficacy and contamination-free processes.
7.3 Sequencing Control:
• Include sequencing standards and controls to verify sequencing
accuracy.
8. SAFETY PRECAUTIONS
• Follow all laboratory safety protocols, including the use of
personal protective equipment (PPE).
• Handle biological specimens with care, adhering to biosafety level
2 (BSL-2) guidelines.
9. REFERENCES
• Insert relevant scientific literature and guidelines here, including
manufacturer's instructions and scientific articles pertinent to the
EPAS1/HIF2A sequencing.
10. DOCUMENTATION
• Maintain detailed records of each step, including DNA extraction,
PCR setup, sequencing data, and quality control results, in
laboratory notebooks or electronic systems.
11. TROUBLESHOOTING
• Refer to the troubleshooting guide associated with each kit and
equipment used.
• Consult laboratory supervisors for persistent or complex issues.
By strictly adhering to this SOP, results for the HYPOXIA-INDUCIBLE
FACTOR ALPHA (EPAS1/HIF2A) GENE, EXONS 9 AND 12
