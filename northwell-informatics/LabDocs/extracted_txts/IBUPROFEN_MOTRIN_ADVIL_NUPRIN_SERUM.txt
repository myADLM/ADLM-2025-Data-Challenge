Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil, Nuprin), Serum
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to define and standardize the
analytical process for the determination and quantification of serum
ibuprofen levels using high-performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC) with UV detection. This will ensure that the results generated
are accurate, consistent, and reliable.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing
the steps in this analytical procedure and documenting all results
accurately.
• It is the responsibility of all laboratory staff to identify any
deviations or issues during the procedure and report them to a
supervisor immediately.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring that all steps are
followed correctly and that any corrective actions taken are
documented.
1. DEFINITIONS
• HPLC: High-Performance Liquid Chromatography
• UV: Ultraviolet Detection
• SOP: Standard Operating Procedure
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Type: Serum
• Volume: Minimum required volume is 1 mL of serum.
• Collection: Use a red-top serum tube without additives.
• Stability: Serum samples are stable for up to 8 hours at room
temperature, 48 hours refrigerated (2-8°C), and up to 1 month
when frozen (-20°C or colder).
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• HPLC System with UV Detector
• Analytical Column: C18, 250 mm x 4.6 mm, 5 μm
• UV Detector Set to 220 nm
• Mobile Phase: Mixture of Acetonitrile and Water (70:30, v/v)
• Ibuprofen Standards (ranging from 0.1 - 100 µg/mL)
• Controls: Low and high concentration quality controls
• Micropipettes and tips, Vials, Tubes, Centrifuge, Water bath
• Standard laboratory glassware and supplies
1. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation of Standard Solutions and Controls
1. Prepare ibuprofen stock solutions by dissolving the pure
analytical standard in methanol.
2. Prepare working standards from the stock solution at desired
concentrations relevant to therapeutic levels (ex: 0.1 - 100 µg/
mL).
3. Prepare quality control samples at low and high concentrations
within the calibration range.
B) Sample Preparation
1. Thaw the serum sample to room temperature, if frozen.
2. Vortex the serum sample for 30 seconds.
3. Centrifuge the sample at 1500g for 10 minutes to separate
serum from any cellular material.
4. Carefully pipette 200 µL of the clear supernatant into a clean
glass vial.
C) HPLC Setup and Analysis
1. Set up the HPLC system, and ensure the UV detector is
calibrated to 220 nm.
2. Equilibrate the HPLC column with the mobile phase
(Acetonitrile:Water, 70:30) at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min for at
least 30 minutes.
3. Inject 20 µL of the standard solutions, controls, and samples
into the HPLC system.
4. Run the HPLC analysis, ensuring good separation of the
ibuprofen peak from any interfering substances.
5. Record retention times and peak areas for all standards,
controls, and samples.
D) Quality Control and Calibration
1. Analyze a blank sample to verify there is no carryover.
2. Run a calibration curve using the standard solutions by plotting
the peak areas against the known concentrations.
3. Include controls with each batch of samples to verify the
accuracy and precision of analytical results.
4. Ensure the calibration curve has a correlation coefficient (R²)
greater than 0.995.
E) Calculation and Reporting of Results
1. Calculate the concentration of ibuprofen in the serum samples
by interpolating the peak area from the calibration curve.
2. Report the results in µg/mL.
3. Review and verify all results by a designated technologist.
4. Document results, including any deviations and corrective
actions, in the laboratory information system (LIS).
5. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Cross-reactivity with other substances should be assessed and
minimized.
• Proper maintenance of the HPLC system is required for accurate
results.
• Analytical recovery and precision should be within acceptable
ranges for clinical relevance.
