Protocol for Analytical Phase of ICOS (CD278) Immunostain,
Technical Component Only
1. PURPOSE:
This protocol outlines procedures for the analytical phase of ICOS
(CD278) Immunostain, Technical Component Only, ensuring accurate
and reproducible results.
2. SCOPE:
Applicable to technical staff responsible for performing ICOS (CD278)
immunostain analyses in the laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY:
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for:
• Performing ICOS (CD278) immunostain analysis.
• Documenting all procedures and observations.
• Ensuring quality control and validity of results.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS:
• Specimen Type: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue
sections.
• Control Specimen: Known positive control tissue section for
ICOS (CD278).
• Unacceptable Specimens: Non-fixed, inadequately fixed, or
excessively processed tissues.
5. MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT:
• Primary Antibody: Anti-ICOS (CD278) antibody (validated for
immunohistochemistry).
• Detection Kit: Compatible detection kit (e.g., polymer-based
detection system).
• Secondary Reagents: All reagents necessary as per the
detection kit instructions.
• Other Reagents:
◦ Xylene
◦ Ethanol (100%, 95%, 70%)
◦ Distilled water
◦ PBS (phosphate-buffered saline)
◦ Hematoxylin
◦ Mounting medium
• Equipment:
◦ Microtome
◦ Slide warmer
◦ Humidity chamber
◦ Automated stainer (if available)
◦ Light microscope
6. PROCEDURE:
A. Preparation:
• Section tissues at 4-5 µm thickness using a microtome. Mount
sections on positively charged slides.
• Heat-dry tissue sections at 60°C for at least 1 hour.
B. Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
1. Deparaffinize slides in xylene (3 changes, 5 minutes each).
2. Rehydrate through graded alcohols (100%, 95%, 70%) to
distilled water.
3. Rinse sections with PBS to remove any remaining alcohol.
C. Antigen Retrieval:
1. Perform antigen retrieval as specified by the antibody
manufacturer (e.g., heat-induced epitope retrieval in sodium
citrate buffer pH 6.0 or EDTA buffer pH 9.0).
2. Cool slides to room temperature and rinse with PBS.
D. Blocking:
1. Incubate sections with blocking solution (e.g., 5% normal serum
or protein block) for 10 minutes to prevent non-specific binding.
E. Primary Antibody Incubation:
1. Apply diluted primary anti-ICOS (CD278) antibody to tissue
sections.
2. Incubate in a humidity chamber at room temperature for the
time specified by the manufacturer (typically 1 hour).
F. Washing:
1. Wash slides in PBS 3 times for 5 minutes each.
G. Secondary Antibody and Detection:
1. Apply secondary antibody and detection reagents following the
manufacturer's instructions.
2. Incubate as required and wash with PBS between each step.
H. Counterstaining:
1. Counterstain with hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes.
2. Wash thoroughly with distilled water.
I. Dehydration and Mounting:
1. Dehydrate through graded alcohols to xylene.
2. Apply a suitable mounting medium and coverslip.
J. Quality Control:
• Include positive and negative tissue controls within each staining
run.
• Inspect control slides under a microscope to validate the staining
process.
7. DOCUMENTATION:
Log the following:
• Date and time of procedure.
• Initials of the technologist performing the procedure.
• Lot numbers and expiration dates of all reagents.
• Control results.
8. REPORTING RESULTS:
• Deliver slides to the pathologist for interpretation.
• Record findings in the laboratory information system (LIS).
9. TROUBLESHOOTING:
• If positive control fails, repeat the run with newly prepared
reagents.
• Ensure optimal antigen retrieval conditions are verified.
• Adjust antibody concentration or incubation times if necessary.
10. REFERENCES:
• Antibody manufacturer's datasheet and staining protocol.
• Internal laboratory guidelines for immunohistochemistry.
• Relevant peer-reviewed publications on ICOS (CD278)
expression and immunostaining techniques.
This standard operating procedure (SOP) should be reviewed
periodically and updated according to advancements in technique or
equipment.
