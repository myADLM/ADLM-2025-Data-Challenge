Draft Protocol for the Analytical Phase of Generating Results for
IDH1 and IDH2 Mutation Analyses, Next-Generation Sequencing,
Tumor
1. PURPOSE
This protocol outlines the procedures for the analytical phase of
generating results for IDH1 and IDH2 mutation analyses using
next-generation sequencing (NGS) on tumor samples. The goal
is to ensure accurate detection and reporting of mutations by
following standardized procedures.
2. SCOPE
This procedure is applicable to all laboratory personnel trained
in performing IDH1 and IDH2 mutation analyses using NGS.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of trained staff to perform the analysis
according to this SOP. Supervisors must ensure that staff are
adequately trained and adhere to all guidelines and procedures
outlined in this protocol.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
a) Acceptable Specimens - Fresh or frozen tumor tissue. -
Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks or
slides.
b) Specimen Handling and Storage - Fresh tissue samples
should be kept at -80°C until analysis. - FFPE tissue blocks/
slides should be stored at room temperature.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
a) Equipment - Next-generation sequencing platform (e.g.,
Illumina MiSeq or equivalent). - PCR machine. - High-speed
centrifuge. - Micro-centrifuge tubes. - Nucleic acid extraction
kits. - Quantification equipment (e.g., Qubit fluorometer,
Nanodrop spectrophotometer).
b) Reagents - DNA extraction reagents and kits. - PCR
reagents and kits. - Sequencing primers specific to IDH1 and
IDH2 genes. - Library preparation kits.
c) Supplies - Micropipettes and sterile pipette tips. - Gloves,
lab coats, and safety goggles. - Sequencing plates, tubes, and
other consumables required for NGS.
6. PROCEDURE
a) DNA Extraction 1. Extract DNA from tumor tissue using an
appropriate DNA extraction kit. 2. Quantify extracted DNA using
Qubit fluorometer or Nanodrop spectrophotometer. 3. Check
DNA quality using gel electrophoresis or equivalent method.
b) PCR Amplification 1. Prepare PCR reaction using specific
primers for IDH1 and IDH2 genes. 2. Perform PCR to amplify
target regions of IDH1 and IDH2 genes. 3. Verify PCR product
by running on agarose gel electrophoresis.
c) Library Preparation 1. Prepare sequencing libraries from
PCR products using library preparation kits. 2. Quantify and
normalize libraries according to manufacturer's protocol.
d) Next-Generation Sequencing 1. Load prepared libraries
onto NGS platform (e.g., Illumina MiSeq). 2. Follow
manufacturer’s instructions for sequencing run setup. 3. Monitor
sequencing run and ensure quality control.
e) Data Analysis 1. Use bioinformatics tools to analyze raw
sequencing data. 2. Identify mutations in IDH1 and IDH2 genes
using variant calling and annotation software. 3. Cross-validate
identified mutations with reference databases.
f) Quality Control 1. Perform internal quality control checks on
extraction, PCR, and sequencing steps. 2. Verify mutation
analysis results with control samples known to contain specific
mutations.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
a) Result Documentation - Document all relevant data
including extracted DNA concentration, PCR conditions,
sequencing metrics, and mutation analysis results.
b) Result Verification - Verify results by cross-checking with
control samples and reference databases. - Ensure that all
results pass quality control checks before release.
c) Result Reporting - Report verified mutation analysis results
in patient records. - Follow site-specific protocols for generating
and distributing patient reports.
8. REFERENCE INTERVALS
◦ Reference intervals are defined based on known mutation
frequencies and documented in appropriate databases.
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
◦ Limitations include the potential for PCR artifacts,
sequencing errors, and interpretation challenges. Refer to
the NGS platform manufacturer’s guidelines and technical
resources for specific limitations.
