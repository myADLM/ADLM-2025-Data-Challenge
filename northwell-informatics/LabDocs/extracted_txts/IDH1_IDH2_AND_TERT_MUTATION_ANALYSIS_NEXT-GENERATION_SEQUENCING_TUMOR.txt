Protocol for Analytical Phase: Generation of Results for IDH1,
IDH2, and TERT Mutation Analysis, Next-Generation
Sequencing, Tumor
1. PURPOSE:
This SOP outlines the procedure for the generation of results for
IDH1, IDH2, and TERT mutation analysis using next-generation
sequencing (NGS) from tumor samples. This protocol ensures
accurate, reliable, and timely delivery of test results essential for
patient diagnosis and treatment planning.
2. RESPONSIBILITY:
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for adhering to this
SOP. It is the responsibility of all laboratory staff to ensure that the
analysis is performed according to the procedure and to notify a
supervisor of any deviations or issues that may arise.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES:
• NGS platforms (e.g., Illumina, Ion Torrent)
• Library preparation kits (e.g., TruSight, AmpliSeq)
• IDH1, IDH2, and TERT specific primers/probes
• PCR thermal cycler
• DNA extraction kits
• Reagents for quality control (QC) and quality assurance (QA)
• Standard laboratory supplies (tubes, pipettors, tips, etc.)
• Sequencing analysis software
4. SAMPLE ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:
Specimen Type: Fresh or formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE)
tumor tissue
5. PROCEDURE:
A. DNA Extraction:
1. Preparation:
◦ Ensure all equipment is calibrated and operational.
◦ Prepare a clean workspace and assemble all necessary
reagents and supplies.
2. Extraction:
◦ Follow the manufacturer's protocol for DNA extraction from
tumor tissue.
◦ Measure DNA concentration and assess purity using a
NanoDrop or similar spectrophotometer.
◦ Ensure yield and purity (A260/A280 ratio of 1.8-2.0 is ideal).
B. Library Preparation:
1. Set-up:
◦ Preheat thermal cycler and prepare reagents according to
the kit instructions.
2. PCR Amplification:
◦ Use specific primers/probes targeting IDH1, IDH2, and
TERT genes.
◦ Perform PCR as per kit protocol.
◦ Ensure correct thermal cycling conditions.
3. Library Construction:
◦ Follow the manufacturer's protocol for library preparation.
◦ Quantify the prepared library using a fluorometer (e.g.,
Qubit).
◦ Normalize library concentration as required by the
sequencing platform.
C. Sequencing:
1. Loading Library:
◦ Load the library onto the NGS platform (e.g., Illumina
MiSeq, NextSeq).
◦ Follow the sequencing platform manufacturer’s instruction
for sample loading and run initiation.
2. Sequencing Run:
◦ Monitor the sequencing run to ensure no deviations or
errors occur.
◦ Ensure machine calibration and performance checks are
completed according to manufacturer guidance.
D. Data Analysis:
1. Quality Control:
◦ Assess raw sequencing data for quality metrics (e.g., Q30
score, read depth).
◦ Ensure the data passes initial QC checks (>80% of bases
with a Q30 score).
2. Alignment and Variant Calling:
◦ Align sequences to the reference genome using appropriate
bioinformatics tools (e.g., BWA, GATK).
◦ Conduct variant calling to identify mutations in IDH1, IDH2,
and TERT genes.
3. Data Interpretation:
◦ Use sequence analysis software to interpret mutation data.
◦ Verify identified mutations by cross-referencing with clinical
databases (e.g., COSMIC, ClinVar).
4. Reporting:
◦ Compile results into a clinical report.
◦ Include details of identified mutations, their potential clinical
significance, and recommendations for further validation if
required.
◦ Ensure results are reviewed and signed off by a qualified
supervisor.
6. QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE:
• Perform routine in-run quality controls using positive and negative
controls.
• Participate in external proficiency testing programs.
• Document all QC and QA measures in the laboratory information
system (LIS).
7. REPORTING RESULTS:
• Ensure that all results are accurately entered into the LIS.
• Provide a clear, concise, and clinically relevant report, formatted
according to site-specific guidelines.
• The report must be reviewed by a qualified pathologist, and
results verified before release.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
• Analysis may be affected by low sample quality or quantity.
• NGS platforms may have inherent error rates; confirmatory testing
(e.g., Sanger sequencing) may be necessary.
• Tissue heterogeneity and tumor DNA purity may affect detection
sensitivity.
9. REFERENCES:
• NGS platform manufacturer’s guidelines and manuals.
• Library preparation kit inserts.
• Clinical and genome databases for variant interpretation.
This SOP will be reviewed annually or following any changes to the
methodology or equipment. All personnel must be trained on this
procedure before conducting the analysis.
