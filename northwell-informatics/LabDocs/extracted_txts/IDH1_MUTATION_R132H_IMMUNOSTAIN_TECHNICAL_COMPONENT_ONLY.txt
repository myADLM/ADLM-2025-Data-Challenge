Standard Operating Procedure for IDH1 Mutation (R132H)
Immunostain, Technical Component Only
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this protocol is to provide detailed
instructions for the preparation, processing, and analysis of
specimens for the detection of IDH1 R132H mutation using
immunohistochemical (IHC) staining. This procedure is vital for
identifying mutations in the IDH1 gene, which may have
diagnostic and prognostic significance in gliomas and other
neoplasms.
2. SCOPE This protocol applies to all technical laboratory
personnel responsible for performing the IDH1 mutation
(R132H) immunostain procedure.
3. RESPONSIBILITY It is the responsibility of designated
laboratory personnel to perform this procedure according to
standard laboratory practices and ensure accurate and
consistent results. Any deviations or anomalies must be
reported to the laboratory supervisor immediately.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS Specimen: Formalin-fixed,
paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue sections. Thickness: 3-5
microns. Adequate fixation: Specimens should be adequately
fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for 24-48 hours.
Unacceptable specimens: Unfixed or over-fixed tissues, frozen
sections.
5. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
◦ Microsystems microtome and water bath
◦ Positive charged glass slides
◦ Xylene
◦ Absolute ethanol
◦ Distilled water
◦ Hydrogen peroxide (3%)
◦ IDH1 R132H antibody kit
◦ DAB (3,3’-diaminobenzidine) chromogen
◦ Hematoxylin
◦ Mounting medium
6. PROCEDURE
A. Sectioning and Mounting
1. Section the FFPE tissue block at 3-5 microns using a
microtome.
2. Float sections on a water bath set at 40-45°C to flatten.
3. Pick up sections onto positively charged glass slides.
4. Place slides in a slide rack and allow them to dry
overnight at room temperature or incubate for 1 hour at
60°C.
B. Deparaffinization and Rehydration
1. Deparaffinize slides in three changes of xylene for 5
minutes each.
2. Rehydrate through a series of graded ethanols (100%,
95%, 70%) for 5 minutes each.
3. Rinse slides in distilled water.
C. Antigen Retrieval
1. Heat-induced epitope retrieval (HIER) should be
performed according to the antibody manufacturer’s
instructions, typically in a citrate buffer (pH 6.0) or EDTA
buffer (pH 9.0) using a microwave or pressure cooker.
2. Allow slides to cool for 20 minutes at room temperature.
3. Rinse slides in distilled water.
D. Blocking Endogenous Peroxidase Activity
1. Incubate slides in 3% hydrogen peroxide for 10 minutes to
block endogenous peroxidase activity.
2. Rinse slides thoroughly in distilled water.
E. Primary Antibody Application
1. Apply the primary IDH1 R132H antibody to the sections
and incubate in a humidified chamber for 60 minutes at
room temperature or as specified by the manufacturer's
protocol.
2. Wash sections in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or Tris-
buffered saline (TBS) for 3 changes of 5 minutes each.
F. Detection System (Secondary Antibody and DAB
Chromogen)
1. Apply the appropriate biotinylated secondary antibody or
polymer-based detection system and incubate as per the
manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Wash slides in PBS or TBS for 3 changes of 5 minutes
each.
3. Apply DAB chromogen solution and incubate for 5-10
minutes or until the desired staining intensity is achieved.
4. Rinse slides in distilled water.
G. Counterstaining
1. Counterstain sections with hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes.
2. Rinse slides in tap water.
3. Blue the sections in ammonia water or Scotts tap water
substitute (optional).
4. Rinse slides in tap water.
H. Dehydration, Clearing, and Mounting
1. Dehydrate sections through graded ethanols (70%, 95%,
100%) for 2 minutes each.
2. Clear sections in 3 changes of xylene for 3 minutes each.
3. Mount coverslips with a suitable mounting medium.
7. QUALITY CONTROL A positive control tissue known to express
the IDH1 R132H mutation and a negative control tissue must
be included in each run to ensure antibody specificity and
staining efficacy. Technologists must verify that staining
intensity and distribution are appropriate.
8. REPORTING RESULTS The stained slides should be reviewed
by a pathologist for interpretation. Results should be
documented in the laboratory information system (LIS) in
accordance with standard laboratory reporting policies.

annually or as required by changes in protocols or laboratory
practices.
