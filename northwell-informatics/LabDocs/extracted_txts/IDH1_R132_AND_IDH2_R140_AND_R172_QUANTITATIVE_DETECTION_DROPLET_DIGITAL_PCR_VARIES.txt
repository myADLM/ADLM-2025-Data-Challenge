Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Protocol for the Analytical
Phase of IDH1 (R132) and IDH2 (R140 and R172) Quantitative
Detection Using Droplet Digital PCR (ddPCR)
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the quantitative detection of
IDH1 (R132) and IDH2 (R140 and R172) mutations in DNA samples
using droplet digital PCR (ddPCR).
Responsibility:
Laboratory technologists and designated personnel are responsible
for performing the ddPCR assay according to this SOP. It is the
responsibility of all staff to ensure the procedure is followed
meticulously to guarantee accurate and reliable results.
1. DEFINITION
Droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) is a highly sensitive technique used for
quantitative detection of DNA mutations. This method involves
partitioning the sample into thousands of droplets, each acting as an
individual PCR reaction.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Acceptable Specimens:
• Fresh or frozen tissue samples
• Blood samples collected in EDTA or Streck tubes
• DNA extracted from tissue or blood samples
Specimen Stability:
• DNA samples should be stored at -20°C or lower for long-term
preservation.
• Extracted DNA should be quantified and assessed for purity
(A260/A280 ratio: 1.8-2.0).
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Samples with hemolysis or clotting
• DNA samples with potential contamination or degradation
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Droplet Digital PCR System (ddPCR)
• Thermal Cycler
• Droplet Generator
• QX200 Droplet Reader
Reagents:
• ddPCR Supermix for Probes
• IDH1 (R132) and IDH2 (R140 and R172) mutation-specific
primers and probes
• Droplet generation oil
• Nuclease-free water
• Positive and negative controls
Supplies:
• PCR plates and seals
• Thermal Cycler tubes
• Pipette tips
• Gloves
• Vortex and centrifuge
1. PROCEDURE
A) DNA Preparation
1. Quantify extracted DNA using a spectrophotometer or Qubit
fluorometer.
2. Ensure DNA concentration is within the optimal range for
ddPCR (10-20 ng/µL).
B) Droplet Generation
1. Prepare the PCR mix with the following components per 20 µL
reaction:
◦ 10 µL ddPCR Supermix for Probes
◦ 1 µL of IDH1 (R132) primer/probe mix
◦ 1 µL of IDH2 (R140/R172) primer/probe mix
◦ 1-2 µL of DNA sample
◦ Nuclease-free water to total volume of 20 µL
2. Mix thoroughly by vortexing and centrifuge briefly.
3. Load the PCR mix into the droplet generator cartridges.
4. Add droplet generation oil to the cartridge and generate
droplets according to the droplet generator instructions.
5. Transfer generated droplets to a PCR plate.
C) PCR Amplification
1. Seal the PCR plate and load into the thermal cycler.
2. Program the thermal cycler with the following cycling
parameters:
◦ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 10 minutes
◦ Denaturation: 94°C for 30 seconds
◦ Annealing/Extension: 60°C for 1 minute (total 40 cycles)
◦ Final extension: 98°C for 10 minutes
◦ Hold at 4°C
D) Droplet Reading
1. After PCR amplification, load the PCR plate into the droplet
reader.
2. Analyze droplets according to the QX200 Droplet Reader
protocol.
E) Data Analysis
1. Export data from the droplet reader to the analysis software.
2. Analyze the number of positive and negative droplets to
determine the concentration of IDH1 (R132) and IDH2 (R140
and R172) mutations.
3. Apply appropriate threshold settings to distinguish between
positive and negative droplets.
4. REPORTING RESULTS
5. Review and verify the ddPCR results.
6. Report quantitative data (mutation concentration) according to
site-specific reporting guidelines.
7. Include relevant comments if the results are outside the
expected range.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform quality control checks using positive and negative
controls with each ddPCR run.
• Verify calibration and maintenance of the droplet digital PCR
system.
• Log all quality control results and corrective actions.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to ddPCR system and reagent manufacturer guidelines for
potential limitations and troubleshooting steps.
