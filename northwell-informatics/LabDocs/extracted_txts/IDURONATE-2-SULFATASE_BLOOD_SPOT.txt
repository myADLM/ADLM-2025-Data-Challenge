Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Analytical Phase: IDURONATE-2-SULFATASE, BLOOD SPOT
1. PURPOSE
To outline the process and ensure the accuracy, reliability, and
consistency of the analytical procedures used for measuring
Iduronate-2-Sulfatase (I2S) activity in dried blood spot specimens.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel involved in the
analysis of dried blood spot specimens for Iduronate-2-Sulfatase
activity.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for following this
SOP.
• The laboratory supervisor is responsible for ensuring compliance
with this procedure, including oversight and validation of results.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Equipment:
◦ Plate reader capable of measuring fluorescence at specific
wavelengths.
◦ Incubator set at 37°C.
◦ Centrifuge.
◦ Pipettes and tips.
◦ Microplate shaker.
• Reagents:
◦ Substrate specific for Iduronate-2-Sulfatase.
◦ Dilution buffer (phosphate-buffered saline or similar).
◦ Lysis buffer.
◦ Fluorescence calibration standards.
◦ Stop solution (if applicable).
• Supplies:
◦ 96-well microplates.
◦ Dried blood spot cards (DBS).
◦ Forceps.
◦ Scalpels or hole punches.
◦ Gloves.
5. DEFINITIONS
• DBS (Dried Blood Spot): A sample obtained by spotting blood
onto a special filter paper, dried, and stored for future analysis.
• I2S (Iduronate-2-Sulfatase): An enzyme whose activity is
measured to aid in the diagnosis of mucopolysaccharidosis type II
(MPS II).
6. PROCEDURE
6.1 Sample Preparation
1. Wear gloves and handle DBS cards with forceps to avoid
contamination.
2. Punch out a 3-mm disk from the center of the dried blood spot
using a sterile punch or scalpel.
3. Place the disk into an individual well of a 96-well microplate.
4. Add 100 µL of lysis buffer to each well containing a blood spot
punch.
5. Incubate the plate at 37°C for 1 hour with gentle shaking to
ensure complete lysis of the blood spot.
6.2 Enzyme Assay
1. Prepare the assay substrate as per the manufacturer’s
instructions.
2. To each well, add the appropriate volume of substrate buffer to
the lysed blood spot sample.
3. Mix gently by tapping the plate.
4. Incubate the plate at 37°C for a specified time (e.g., 2 hours),
protected from light.
5. After incubation, add the stop solution to each well if required to
terminate the reaction.
6. Measure the fluorescence at specific excitation and emission
wavelengths using a plate reader.
6.3 Calibration and Quality Control
1. Prepare calibration standards with known concentrations of the
substrate to generate a standard curve.
2. Include quality control samples (low, medium, high I2S activity)
in each assay to evaluate assay performance.
3. Analyze and record the fluorescence readings of calibration
standards and quality control samples.
6.4 Interpretation and Reporting of Results
1. Plot the standard curve by graphing the fluorescence intensity
against the known standard concentrations.
2. Use the standard curve to calculate the I2S activity in each
blood spot sample.
3. Compare patient results to established reference ranges and
control values.
4. Record all results in the laboratory information system (LIS).
5. Any critical values or unexpected results should be reviewed
and verified by a supervisor or a qualified technologist before
releasing the results.
7. QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE
1. Perform regular maintenance and calibration of the plate reader
and other equipment as per manufacturer’s guidelines.
2. Document and review all quality control results and take
corrective actions if QC results are outside acceptable limits.
3. Participate in external proficiency testing programs, if available,
to validate the accuracy of I2S assays.
8. SAFETY
1. Follow standard laboratory safety protocols and wear
appropriate protective equipment (gloves, lab coat).
2. Dispose of all biological waste and sharps according to
biohazard disposal guidelines.
3. Handle all reagents and chemicals according to their safety
data sheets (SDS).
9. REFERENCES
1. Manufacturer's instructions for specific reagents and
equipment.
2. Relevant clinical laboratory standards for enzymatic assays.
3. Internal laboratory quality control guidelines and policies.
