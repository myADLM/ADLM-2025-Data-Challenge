Protocol for IDURONATE-2-SULFATASE Analysis in Leukocytes
1. PURPOSE: The purpose of this SOP is to outline the
procedures for the accurate and precise analysis of
iduronate-2-sulfatase (I2S) activity in leukocytes. Determination
of I2S activity is crucial for diagnosis and monitoring of
Mucopolysaccharidosis Type II (Hunter syndrome).
2. RESPONSIBILITY: It is the responsibility of all qualified
laboratory personnel to follow this protocol and ensure that all
steps are conducted meticulously to guarantee accurate
results. The laboratory manager or designated supervisor is
responsible for ensuring that all personnel are adequately
trained and competent in performing this procedure.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS:
• Specimen: Peripheral blood collected in heparinized tubes
(preferred) or ACD tubes.
• Acceptable volume: At least 8-10 mL whole blood is required to
isolate sufficient leukocytes.
• Transport: Samples should be kept at 2-8°C and transported to
the laboratory as soon as possible within 24 hours of collection.
1. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES:
• Reagents: Appropriate buffers, substrates for I2S activity assay,
stop solutions, and calibration standards.
• Leukocyte isolation kit.
• Equipments: Centrifuge, vortex mixer, water bath, pipettes and
tips, 96-well microplate, microplate reader or spectrophotometer,
reagent reservoir, and sample storage tubes.
1. PROCEDURE:
5.1 Sample Processing:
1. Mix the peripheral blood sample gently by inversion.
2. Separate the leukocytes using the leukocyte isolation kit
according to manufacturer’s instructions.
3. Wash leukocyte pellet twice with PBS, resuspend in 1 mL PBS,
and count to adjust to a concentration of 1 x 10^6 cells/mL.
5.2 Enzyme Reaction Setup:
1. Aliquot 50 µL of leukocyte suspension into each well of a 96-
well microplate.
2. Add 50 µL of assay buffer containing the specific fluorescent or
chromogenic substrate for I2S.
3. Incubate at 37°C for 1-2 hours depending on assay
specifications.
4. Add 25 µL of stop solution to terminate the reaction.
5.3 Detection and Analysis:
1. Measure the fluorescence or absorbance using a microplate
reader or spectrophotometer.
◦ For fluorescence: Set up the microplate reader with
excitation and emission wavelengths according to assay kit
instructions.
◦ For colorimetric: Measure absorbance at appropriate
wavelength, typically 405 nm or 450 nm.
2. Record the data and calculate the I2S activity based on the
standard calibration curve.
5.4 Quality Control:
1. Include positive and negative controls in each assay run.
2. Analyze at least two levels of quality control materials (high and
low) to ensure assay integrity.
3. If results fall outside the predefined acceptable range, repeat
the entire assay.
4. REPORTING RESULTS:
5. Express I2S activity in terms of nmol/hour/million cells.
6. Document results in the laboratory information system (LIS).
7. Review all results for consistency and accuracy before final
validation by designated personnel.
8. INTERPRETATION:
• Reference intervals and clinical decision points should be
established based on the assay kit insert and scientific literature.
• Report outliers and consult with a clinical specialist for
interpretation of abnormal results.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
• Ensure adequate leukocyte count for precise results.
• Avoid hemolysis and contamination with platelets or erythrocytes
which could interfere with assay outcomes.
• Ensure all reagents are within expiration date and properly stored.
1. REFERENCES:
• Manufacturer’s instructions for leukocyte isolation and I2S activity
assay.
• Relevant scientific literature.
This SOP is in force as of the date of its issuance and must be
adhered to by all laboratory personnel conducting the I2S activity
tests in leukocytes.
