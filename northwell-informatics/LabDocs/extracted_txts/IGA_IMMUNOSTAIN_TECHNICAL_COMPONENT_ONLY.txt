Protocol for the Analytical Phase of Generating Results for IgA
Immunostain: Technical Component Only
1. PURPOSE
This procedure outlines the technical process for performing IgA
immunostaining on tissue samples to ensure accurate and
reproducible results. The procedure includes staining, quality control
measures, and result documentation. This protocol does not include
result interpretation, which is to be performed by a certified
pathologist.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory personnel to
perform IgA immunostaining according to this protocol. All staff
members are responsible for following the procedures correctly to
ensure accurate results.
1. DEFINITION
IgA Immunostain: A staining method used to detect the presence of
Immunoglobulin A (IgA) in tissue samples using specific antibodies
and immunohistochemistry (IHC) techniques.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Microtome
• Positive control tissue
• Paraffin-embedded tissue sections
• Xylene
• Ethanol (100%, 95%, 70%)
• Distilled water
• Antigen retrieval solution
• Blocking solution
• Primary anti-IgA antibody
• Secondary antibody
• DAB (3,3'-Diaminobenzidine) substrate
• Hematoxylin counterstain
• Mounting medium
• Glass slides and cover slips
• Humidified chamber
• Microscopy slide incubator
• Automated or manual IHC staining platform
• Timer
• Disposable gloves, lab coats, and other PPE
1. PROCEDURE
A. Tissue Preparation
1. Section the paraffin-embedded tissue blocks at 3-4 µm
thickness using a microtome.
2. Float sections on a water bath (40–45°C) and mount onto glass
slides.
3. Bake slides in a slide incubator at 60°C for 1 hour to ensure
proper adhesion.
B. Deparaffinization and Rehydration
1. Place slides in xylene for 2 x 5 minutes.
2. Transfer slides through graded ethanol solutions (100%, 95%,
70%) for 2 x 3 minutes each.
3. Rinse slides in distilled water for 2 x 5 minutes.
C. Antigen Retrieval
1. Heat slides in antigen retrieval solution using an appropriate
method (e.g., microwave, pressure cooker, water bath) for 20
minutes.
2. Allow slides to cool to room temperature for 20 minutes.
3. Rinse slides in distilled water for 2 x 5 minutes.
D. Blocking
1. Apply blocking solution to cover the entire tissue section and
incubate in a humidified chamber for 10 minutes.
2. Drain excess blocking solution without washing.
E. Primary Antibody Incubation
1. Apply diluted primary anti-IgA antibody to cover the tissue
section completely.
2. Incubate slides in a humidified chamber at room temperature
for 1 hour.
3. Rinse slides in buffer solution (e.g., PBS or TBS) for 3 x 5
minutes.
F. Secondary Antibody Incubation
1. Apply the secondary antibody to cover the tissue section
completely.
2. Incubate slides in a humidified chamber at room temperature
for 30 minutes.
3. Rinse slides in buffer solution (e.g., PBS or TBS) for 3 x 5
minutes.
G. DAB Substrate Application
1. Apply DAB substrate solution to cover the tissue section.
2. Monitor the staining under a microscope until the desired
intensity is achieved (typically 5-10 minutes).
3. Rinse slides in distilled water for 3 x 5 minutes.
H. Counterstaining
1. Immerse slides in hematoxylin solution for 1-2 minutes.
2. Rinse slides in distilled water for 2 x 5 minutes.
3. Dip slides briefly in a weak acid-alcohol solution (optional) and
rinse in distilled water.
I. Dehydration and Mounting
1. Dehydrate slides through graded ethanol solutions (70%, 95%,
100%) for 2 x 3 minutes each.
2. Place slides in xylene for 2 x 5 minutes.
3. Mount coverslips using a suitable mounting medium.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include positive and negative controls with each batch of slides
stained.
• Ensure the staining procedure is consistent across all slides.
• Document any deviations from the procedure and corrective
actions taken.
1. RESULT DOCUMENTATION
• Document the staining procedure, including reagent lot numbers,
incubation times, and any deviations in a laboratory notebook or
electronic system.
• Microscopic evaluation is to be performed by a certified
pathologist.
• Technologists are to ensure all procedural steps have been
completed accurately before passing slides to the pathologist.
