Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for IGA SUBCLASSES,
SERUM
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the procedure for the quantitative analysis of
Immunoglobulin A (IgA) subclasses (IgA1 and IgA2) in serum
samples. The measured concentrations will help in diagnosing and
monitoring patients with immune deficiencies and other related health
conditions.
Responsibility:
• Designated staff (technologists) are responsible for performing the
analysis and ensuring its accuracy.
• It is the responsibility of all personnel to identify any issues
affecting test quality and bring them to the attention of the
supervisor.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring that the procedures are
performed and documented correctly, including any corrective
actions required.
1. DEFINITION
The analysis covers the two subclasses of Immunoglobulin A found in
human serum, IgA1 and IgA2.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation of Samples:
1. Ensuring Sample Integrity:
◦ Confirm that samples are received correctly, with no signs of
contamination or hemolysis.
◦ Samples should be stored at 2-8°C if immediate analysis is
not possible.
◦ Centrifuge (if needed) to remove particulates and ensure
serum clarity.
2. Acceptable Specimens:
◦ Freshly collected serum, delivered to the lab promptly.
◦ Stored and transported on cold packs if delays are
unavoidable.
3. Unacceptable Specimens:
◦ Clotted, hemolyzed, or lipemic samples.
◦ Samples without proper identification or associated
documentation.
B. Reagents and Supplies:
1. Use commercially available IgA subclass-specific kits which
typically include:
◦ Calibration standards.
◦ Patient-specific reagents.
◦ Detection antibodies.
◦ Controls (both negative and positive).
2. Store reagents according to the manufacturer's instructions and
do not use beyond their expiration date.
C. Procedure:
1. Calibration:
◦ Prepare calibration standards as per the manufacturer's
instructions.
◦ Perform a calibration run before analyzing patient samples
to ensure the system's accuracy.
2. Quality Control:
◦ Run quality control samples (low, medium, and high) before
patient samples.
◦ Ensure quality control results are within the established
acceptable range before proceeding with patient samples.
3. Sample Analysis:
a. Pre-Analysis Preparation:
◦ Allow reagents to come to room temperature (if required by
the manufacturer).
◦ Vortex patient samples, QC materials, and calibration
standards briefly before use.
b. Assay Setup:
◦ Pipette appropriate volumes of patient samples, controls,
and calibrators into designated wells or sample tubes.
◦ Follow the kit's specific protocol steps (including incubation
times, temperatures, and washing steps).
◦ Add detection antibody and any other required reagents
according to the kit’s instructions.
c. Detection and Measurement:
◦ Place the assay plate/sample tubes in the appropriate
analyzer.
◦ Perform readings as specified by the assay protocol.
◦ Record the results generated by the analyzer.
D. Result Interpretation:
1. Review the results:
◦ Examine the calibration curve and ensure it meets the
acceptance criteria.
◦ Verify quality control results and confirm they are within
acceptable limits.
2. Calculate concentrations based on the established calibration
curve:
◦ Use the analyzer software or manual calculations if
specified by the kit manufacturer.
3. Results Validation:
◦ Ensure results are checked for any flags or errors indicated
by the analyzer.
◦ Address any QC failures or unexpected results according to
troubleshooting guidelines.
◦ Ensure supervisor review and verification of results when
necessary.
E. Reporting Results:
1. Document results:
◦ Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
◦ Ensure all results, including any comments or flags, are
accurately recorded.
2. Result Release:
◦ Technologists must verify and release results according to
the laboratory’s specific guidelines.
◦ Ensure timely communication of critical results to the
relevant healthcare providers.
F. Post-Analysis Procedures:
1. Clean up:
◦ Dispose of biohazard waste appropriately.
◦ Clean work surfaces and equipment used during the
analysis.
2. Maintenance:
◦ Perform regular maintenance on analyzers and other
equipment as specified.
◦ Document maintenance activities performed.
G. Troubleshooting:
1. If any issues arise during analysis (e.g., unexpected QC results,
instrument errors), follow the manufacturer’s guidelines and
laboratory protocol for troubleshooting.
2. Document any corrective actions taken and notify the
supervisor of significant issues.
3. QUALITY ASSURANCE
4. Internal and External Controls:
◦ Analyze internal control samples with each batch of patient
specimens.
◦ Participate in external proficiency testing programs for
continual performance evaluation.
5. Method Validation:
◦ Validate new batches of reagents and any new lots of test
kits before use.
◦ Perform periodic proficiency testing to ensure method
consistency and accuracy.

1. SAFETY
• Employ standard laboratory biohazard precautions when handling
serum samples.
• Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (lab coat, gloves,
eye protection).
This SOP ensures the precise, reliable, and accurate measurement
of IgA subclasses in serum, contributing to high-quality laboratory
diagnostics.
