Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for IGD Immunostain,
Technical Component Only
1. PURPOSE
To outline the standardized technical procedure for performing
immunostains specific for IgD (Immunoglobulin D) in the laboratory,
to ensure consistent and accurate staining results for patient
specimens.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Microtome
• Slide warmer
• Staining racks
• Microscope
Reagents:
• Primary Anti-IgD Antibody (vendor-specific, ensure it is within its
expiration date)
• Secondary Antibody (enzyme-conjugated; vendor-specific)
• Blocking solution (e.g., BSA, horse serum)
• Buffer solutions (PBS, TBS)
• Chromogen/Substrate (e.g., DAB, AEC)
• Counterstain (e.g., Hematoxylin)
• Mounting medium (e.g., aqueous or resin-based)
• Xylene and alcohol solutions for dehydration
Supplies:
• Microtome blades (clean and sharp)
• Frosted microscope slides
• Cover slips
• Positive and negative control tissues
• Timer
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation of Specimens
• Ensure specimens are fixed in formalin and embedded in paraffin.
• Cut tissue sections approximately 4-5 microns thick using a
microtome.
• Place sections on appropriately labeled microscope slides and
allow them to adhere using a slide warmer (45°C) for 1 hour or
overnight at room temperature.
B. Deparaffinization and Rehydration
1. Immerse slides in xylene for 10 minutes, twice.
2. Immerse slides in 100% ethanol for 5 minutes, twice.
3. Immerse slides sequentially in 95%, 85%, and 70% ethanol for
3 minutes each.
4. Rinse slides in distilled water for 5 minutes.
C. Antigen Retrieval
1. Heat-induced epitope retrieval (HIER) method:
◦ Immerse slides in appropriate retrieval buffer (e.g., citrate
buffer pH 6.0) and hemeselect.
◦ Heat in microwave or water bath maintaining a temperature
of 95-100°C for 20 minutes.
◦ Allow to cool for 20 minutes at room temperature.
◦ Rinse slides in distilled water and then in PBS or TBS buffer.
D. Blocking
1. Apply blocking solution to cover the sections on each slide to
prevent non-specific binding. Incubate for 20 minutes at room
temperature.
2. Remove excess blocking solution without washing.
E. Primary Antibody Incubation
1. Apply primary anti-IgD antibody optimized concentration (as per
manufacturer's recommendation) to the sections.
2. Incubate overnight at 4°C or for 60 minutes at room
temperature.
F. Washing
1. Wash slides in PBS or TBS buffer three times for 5 minutes
each.
G. Secondary Antibody Incubation
1. Apply enzyme-conjugated secondary antibody (optimized
concentration).
2. Incubate the slides for 30 minutes at room temperature.
H. Washing
1. Wash slides in PBS or TBS buffer three times for 5 minutes
each.
I. Chromogen/Substrate Application
1. Apply chromogen/substrate solution (e.g., DAB) covering the
tissue sections.
2. Monitor the development of the stain microscopically (typically
takes 5-10 minutes).
3. Stop reaction by immersing slides in distilled water.
J. Counterstaining
1. Immerse slides in hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes.
2. Rinse in running tap water for 5 minutes.
3. Immerse in 0.3% acid-alcohol briefly (if necessary).
4. Rinse slides in water, then immerse in bluing reagent for 1
minute.
5. Rinse thoroughly in distilled water.
K. Dehydration and Mounting
1. Dehydrate: Immerse slides in graded alcohols (70%, 95%, and
100%) and xylene.
2. Mount: Apply coverslips using mounting medium.
L. Reporting and Documentation
• Ensure technical accuracy of the staining result and match to
control slides.
• Document all steps performed, including any deviations from the
standard protocol.
• Verify the quality of the stain under the microscope and
photograph if necessary.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
Ensure consistent staining by including positive and negative control
slides in every batch of immunostains. Record and track quality
control measures and adjust antibody concentrations or incubation
times if consistent issues arise.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING
• Uneven staining: Check section thickness, reagent volumes, and
incubation times.
• Non-specific staining: Ensure proper blocking and wash steps are
followed.
• Weak staining: Optimize antigen retrieval and antibody
concentrations as needed.

1. SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS
Ensure adherence to laboratory safety protocols, including the use of
personal protective equipment (PPE) and proper disposal of chemical
waste.
1. REVIEW AND UPDATES
This SOP should be reviewed annually and updated as needed to
ensure consistency with current laboratory best practices and
manufacturer recommendations.
