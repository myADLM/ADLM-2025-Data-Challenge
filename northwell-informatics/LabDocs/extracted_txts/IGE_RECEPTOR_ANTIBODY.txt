Standard Operating Procedure
(SOP)
Analytical Phase – Generating Results for
IgE Receptor Antibody (IgE-RA) Assay
1. PURPOSE
To delineate the steps for the accurate and consistent processing,
analysis, and generation of results for IgE Receptor Antibody (IgE-
RA) tests in a CLIA-certified laboratory.
2. SCOPE
This protocol applies to all laboratory personnel responsible for
conducting the IgE-RA assay and generating patient results.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
The designated laboratory personnel must ensure compliance with
this SOP. It is the responsibility of the lab manager or supervisor to
monitor adherence to these procedures and to address any issues
that may arise.
4. DEFINITIONS
• IgE-RA: Immunoglobulin E Receptor Antibody
• ELISA: Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay
5. PROCEDURE
A) EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS
• ELISA Reader (with appropriate filters)
• Micropipettes (various volumes as required by the kit)
• Multichannel pipette
• Reservoirs for dispensing reagents
• Microplate washer (if available)
• Calibration controls (provided with the assay kit)
• Specific IgE-RA assay kit components (includes microtiter plate,
standards, controls, reagents, and substrate)
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
• Disposable gloves
• Laboratory coat or gown
B) REAGENTS AND KIT STORAGE
• Store IgE-RA assay kit reagents as specified by the manufacturer
(typically at 2-8°C).
• Buffer reagents and substrates should be stored at room
temperature until use.
• Ensure all reagents are at room temperature before beginning the
assay.
C) SAMPLE PREPARATION
1. Specimen Requirements:
◦ Accepted: Serum or plasma samples collected into EDTA or
heparinized tubes.
◦ Minimum volume: 100 µL
2. Unacceptable Specimens:
◦ Samples with visible hemolysis.
◦ Samples that have not been stored as per recommended
guidelines (e.g., extended periods at room temperature).
3. Preparation:
◦ Centrifuge samples at 1500 x g for 10 minutes.
◦ Transfer clear supernatant to a clean, labeled tube.
◦ Store at 2-8°C if analyzing within 48 hours; otherwise, store
at -20°C or lower.
D) ASSAY VALIDATION AND QUALITY CONTROL
1. Calibration:
◦ Use standards provided in the assay kit.
◦ Prepare a standard curve according to the kit instructions.
◦ Ensure calibration controls are included in each run.
2. Quality Control:
◦ Include low, medium, and high-level controls in each assay.
◦ Validate the assay by ensuring control results fall within the
specified ranges.
E) PROCEDURE
1. Plate Setup:
◦ Refer to the ELISA kit insert for detailed instructions on the
plate layout and reagent additions.
◦ Add standards, controls, and patient samples to the
designated wells.
2. Incubation:
◦ Add the detection antibody and incubate according to the
manufacturer's instructions (e.g., 30-60 minutes at room
temperature).
3. Washing:
◦ Wash plates using an automated plate washer or manually
with a wash bottle as specified.
◦ Ensure thorough washing to minimize background
interference.
4. Substrate Addition:
◦ Add the substrate solution to all wells.
◦ Incubate in the dark as per the kit's prescribed conditions.
5. Stopping Reaction:
◦ After the specified incubation, add stop solution to each
well.
6. Reading:
◦ Measure the absorbance of each well using an ELISA
reader set to the wavelength specified in the kit (commonly
450 nm).
◦ Ensure that the absorber reader is calibrated and the
settings conform to assay requirements.
F) RESULT CALCULATION AND INTERPRETATION
1. Data Analysis:
◦ Use the software associated with the ELISA reader to
generate the standard curve.
◦ Calculate the concentration of IgE-RA in patient samples
based on the standard curve.
◦ Double-check calculations and ensure all controls fall within
the acceptable range.
2. Result Validation:
◦ Results from each assay run must be reviewed and
validated by a senior technologist or supervisor.
◦ Verify that the internal controls and calibration standards
meet the required specifications.
G) REPORTING RESULTS
1. Documentation:
◦ Record all results in the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
◦ Each reported result must be accompanied by relevant QC
data and assay conditions.
2. Critical Results:
◦ Critical results should be flagged according to the
laboratory’s policy for immediate review and communication
to the healthcare provider.
H) MAINTENANCE AND TROUBLESHOOTING
• Ensure all equipment is calibrated and maintained according to
the manufacturer's specifications.
• In case of QC or calibration failures, follow laboratory protocols to
troubleshoot, revalidate, and document corrective actions.
• Address any equipment malfunctions or irregularities immediately
and involve technical support if needed.
