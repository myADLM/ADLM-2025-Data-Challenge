1. PURPOSE
To provide standardized procedures for the analytical phase of
generating results for Insulin-like Growth Factor 2 (IGF-2) assays,
ensuring accurate and reliable results consistent with regulatory
standards and laboratory quality management systems.
2. SCOPE
This protocol applies to all personnel trained in performing IGF-2
assays in the laboratory. It covers the procedures from specimen
preparation to result reporting.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
All designated laboratory personnel must adhere to this protocol
when performing IGF-2 assays. It is the responsibility of the
laboratory supervisor to ensure that all staff are trained and
competencies are maintained.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type: Serum or Plasma.
Collection Device: Ensure specimen is collected in serum separator
tubes (SST) or plasma (EDTA, heparin) tubes.
Volume: A minimum volume of 1 mL is required.
Stability:
• Room Temperature: 8 hours
• Refrigerated (2-8°C): 48 hours
• Frozen (≤-20°C): Stable for 6 months
Unacceptable Conditions:
• Specimens with gross hemolysis or lipemia
• Specimens collected in sodium fluoride/oxalate, citrate, or other
non-recommended anticoagulants.
• Unlabeled or improperly labeled samples
5. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
Equipment:
• Centrifuge
• IGF-2 specific assay analyzer (e.g., ELISA reader)
• Pipettes and tips
• Vortex mixer
Reagents:
• IGF-2 assay kit, according to manufacturer's instructions
• Calibrators and controls
• Deionized water
Storage:
• Reagents should be stored according to the manufacturer's
instructions, typically at 2-8°C.
• Do not use reagents past their expiration date.
6. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Preparation:
1. Allow serum samples to clot at room temperature for 30
minutes.
2. Centrifuge serum or plasma samples at 1500 x g for 10
minutes.
3. Aliquot supernatant to avoid hemolysis and proceed to assay.
B. Assay Setup:
1. Bring all reagents and samples to room temperature (20-25°C)
before use.
2. Label sufficient number of microtiter wells for standards,
controls, and patient samples.
3. Follow manufacturer’s instructions for preparation of standards
and controls.
4. Pipette required volume (usually 50-100 µL, per manufacturer's
instructions) of standards, controls, and samples into respective
wells.
5. Add conjugate reagent to each well and incubate according to
the manufacturer’s protocol (e.g., 1 hour at room temperature).
C. Washing and Signal Generation:
1. Wash each well with wash buffer provided in the kit (typically
3-5 cycles as per manufacturer's instructions).
2. Add substrate solution to each well and incubate in the dark for
the recommended time (e.g., 20-30 minutes).
3. Stop the reaction by adding stop solution.
D. Measurement and Data Processing:
1. Read the absorbance at the specified wavelength (e.g., 450 nm
primary, 620 nm reference) using a microplate reader.
2. Generate the standard curve by plotting the absorbance values
against the known concentrations of IGF-2 standards.
3. Use the standard curve to determine the IGF-2 concentrations
in patient samples and controls.
4. Ensure recalibration of the equipment regularly as per
guidelines and verification against control samples to ensure
accuracy.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform quality control checks with each assay run using low,
medium, and high controls.
• Document control results and ensure they fall within established
ranges before reporting patient results.
• If controls are out of range, investigate and resolve the issue
before proceeding with patient samples.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results will be automatically transferred to the Laboratory
Information System (LIS) and must be reviewed by a qualified
technologist prior to verification.
• If any sample integrity issues (e.g., hemolysis, lipemia) are
detected, the sample should be reassessed, and appropriate
comments should be added to the report.
9. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• The reference intervals provided by the assay manufacturer
should be utilized unless the laboratory has established its own
reference ranges through validation studies.
10. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to the assay kit insert for specific methodological limitations,
including potential interferences and the assay detection limits.
11. DOCUMENTATION AND RECORD KEEPING
• Ensure all log sheets, control records, and maintenance logs are
maintained and reviewed regularly by supervisory staff.
• The completed assay templates and generated reports should be
stored appropriately for traceability and auditing purposes.
