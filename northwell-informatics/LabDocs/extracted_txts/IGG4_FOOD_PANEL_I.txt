Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Generating Results for
IGG4 Food Panel I Testing
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedures for the analysis
and generation of results for the IGG4 Food Panel I testing in the
laboratory. This protocol ensures the reliability and accuracy of test
results, adherence to quality control standards, and proper
documentation throughout the analytical phase.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of laboratory technologists to perform the IGG4
Food Panel I test in accordance with this SOP and document all
aspects of the procedure. Supervisors are responsible for ensuring
the procedure is followed, overseeing quality control, and addressing
any issues that may arise.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type:
• Serum: Preferably, a red-top or serum-separating tube (SST) is
used for collection. Obtain at least 2 mL of serum.
Specimen Handling:
• Centrifuge the sample within 2 hours of collection.
• Separate the serum from the clot and store at 2-8°C if testing will
be performed within 48 hours. For long-term storage, aliquot the
serum and store at -20°C or lower.
Reject Criteria:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
• Insufficient volume.
• Samples that have not been properly labelled or have an
unknown collection date.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• ELISA Reader (set to 450 nm)
• Incubator
• Microplate Washer
• Pipettes and tips
• Microwell ELISA plates specific for IGG4 Food Panel I
• IGG4 Food Panel I assay reagents (including calibrators, controls,
conjugate, substrate, and stop solution)
• Deionized water
1. PROCEDURE
2. Preparation: a. Thaw serum samples, calibrators, and controls
completely and mix well before use. b. Bring all reagents and
samples to room temperature (20-25°C) before beginning the
assay.
3. ELISA Assay Steps: a. Label and arrange the microwell ELISA
plate in accordance with the assay layout. b. Add 100 µL of
calibrator, control, and patient serum into the appropriate wells.
c. Incubate the plate at 37°C for 30 minutes. d. Wash the plate
five times with 300 µL washing buffer, ensuring complete
removal of liquid between washes. e. Add 100 µL of enzyme
conjugate to each well and cover the plate. f. Incubate at 37°C
for 30 minutes. g. Wash the plate five times with 300 µL
washing buffer. h. Add 100 µL of substrate solution to each well.
i. Incubate at room temperature for 15 minutes, avoiding direct
light. j. Add 50 µL stop solution to each well to terminate the
reaction. k. Measure the absorbance at 450 nm using the
ELISA reader.
4. Quality Control: a. Run internal controls with each assay to
ensure accuracy. b. If control values fall outside the established
range, repeat the assay and investigate potential causes.
5. Data Analysis: a. Calculate the results based on the calibration
curve generated using the ELISA software. b. Verify that patient
results fall within the expected range.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
7. Review and validation:
◦ Compare and confirm the calculated results with control and
calibrator values.
◦ Reassess any outliers or results that fall outside the
expected range.
8. Transmitting results:
◦ Enter the validated results into the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
◦ Ensure all results are checked and signed off by the
responsible laboratory technologist or supervisor.
9. Documentation:
◦ Record all relevant information, including the assay date, lot
numbers of reagents, and any deviations or anomalies, in
the laboratory logbook.
◦ Retain all raw data and calculation sheets for review and
auditing purposes.
10. MAINTENANCE OF EQUIPMENT
11. Perform regular maintenance and calibration of the ELISA
reader, incubator, and microplate washer as per manufacturer
guidelines.
12. Document all maintenance activities, including routine checks
and troubleshooting steps, in the equipment log.
