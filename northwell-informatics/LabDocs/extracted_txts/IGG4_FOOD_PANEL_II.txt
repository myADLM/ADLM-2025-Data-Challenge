Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating IGG4 Food Panel II Results
1. PURPOSE
This SOP provides a detailed, step-by-step process for the analysis
and generation of IGG4 Food Panel II results, ensuring consistent
and accurate evaluation.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to the laboratory staff involved in the analysis
and reporting of IGG4 Food Panel II results.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Laboratory Technologist: Responsible for performing the test as
per SOP, ensuring all the equipment is functioning properly, and
documenting the results.
• Supervisor: Review and authorize the results before final
reporting, handling any discrepancies, and ensuring proper
training of staff.
4. DEFINITION
IGG4 Food Panel II is a diagnostic test used to measure the levels of
Immunoglobulin G4 antibodies specific to a range of food antigens to
identify potential food sensitivities.
5. MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT
• IGG4 Food Panel II kit
• Microplate reader
• Refrigerator (2-8°C)
• Calibrated pipettes and tips
• Deionized or distilled water
• Microcentrifuge
• Incubator
• Laboratory timer
• IGG4 control serum (positive and negative)
• Sample log and report form
6. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STORAGE
• Specimen Type: Serum
• Collection Tube: Serum separator tube (SST)
• Volume Required: Minimum of 500 µL of serum
• Storage: Store serum samples at 2-8°C if processing within 48
hours, or freeze at -20°C if stored longer.
7. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation
1. Serum Separation:
◦ Centrifuge the SST at 3000 RPM for 10 minutes to separate
the serum.
◦ Transfer the serum to a labeled microcentrifuge tube.
2. Warming:
◦ Allow refrigerated samples to come to room temperature
(~20-25°C) before performing the assay.
B. Assay Procedure
1. Reagent Preparation:
◦ Reconstitute kit reagents as described in the IGG4 Food
Panel II kit insert.
◦ Prepare wash buffer and necessary dilutions of controls and
tests serum.
2. Plate Preparation:
◦ Set up the microplate as per the kit's layout plan, including
blanks, standards, controls, and test samples.
◦ Recommended: run each control and sample in duplicate.
3. Adding Standards/Samples:
◦ Add 100 µL of each standard, control, and test serum to the
assigned wells.
◦ Incubate the plate at 37°C for 1 hour.
4. Washing:
◦ Decant the contents of the plate wells.
◦ Wash the wells 3 times with 200 µL of the prepared wash
buffer, ensuring there is no residual liquid.
5. Conjugate Addition:
◦ Add 100 µL of the enzyme-labeled anti-IGG4 conjugate to
each well.
◦ Incubate the plate at 37°C for 30 minutes.
6. Washing:
◦ Repeat the wash step to remove unbound conjugate.
7. Substrate Addition:
◦ Add 100 µL of substrate solution to each well.
◦ Incubate at room temperature for 15-20 minutes in the dark.
8. Stopping the Reaction:
◦ Add 50 µL of stop solution to each well to stop the
enzymatic reaction.
C. Reading and Interpretation
1. Microplate Reading:
◦ Within 10 minutes of stopping the reaction, read the optical
density (OD) at 450 nm using the microplate reader.
2. Calculating Results:
◦ Generate a standard curve using OD values of standards to
determine sample concentrations.
◦ Calculations should be automated using the microplate
reader software or manually as per kit instructions.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
• Intra-assay Control:
◦ Include both positive and negative control serums in every run.
◦ Ensure the controls are within the expected range for the
assay to be valid.
• Inter-assay Reproducibility:
◦ Regularly assess the consistency of results between runs.
◦ Participate in external quality assurance programs if available.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
• Documentation:
◦ Record all details, including sample identifier, run date, OD
readings, and calculated concentrations.
◦ Cross-verify results with reference ranges provided in the kit
insert.
• Review and Validation:
◦ Supervisor to review all results for accuracy before final
reporting.
◦ Flag any results outside of standard ranges or unexpected
patterns for further verification.
10. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Ensure reagents and samples are at the correct temperature
before starting the assay.
• Any hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples may affect results.
• Follow all kit instructions precisely to avoid variability.
