Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for IgG4 Food Panel VIII
1. PURPOSE
This procedure outlines the steps and standards for the analytical
phase of generating IgG4 Food Panel VIII results. The aim is to
ensure accurate, reliable, and consistent test results for patient
diagnosis and treatment.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel involved in the analysis
of specimens for the IgG4 Food Panel VIII.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all designated laboratory personnel to
perform the analysis as per this SOP and ensure that all steps are
documented. Laboratory supervisors are responsible for overseeing
the process and ensuring compliance with this SOP.
4. DEFINITIONS
IgG4 Food Panel VIII: A test to measure specific IgG4 antibodies to
various food antigens, used to assess potential food sensitivities.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Automated immunoassay analyzer with IgG4 Food Panel VIII
capabilities
• IgG4 Food Panel VIII reagent kits
• Calibrated pipettes and tips
• Calibrated centrifuge
• Microtiter plates (enzymatic immunoassay specific)
• Control sera (high, normal, low)
• Reference standards
• Appropriate laboratory consumables (e.g., gloves, lab coat, etc.)
6. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND PREPARATION
Acceptable Specimens:
• Serum: Collected in a serum separator tube (SST), allow to clot at
room temperature before centrifugation.
• Plasma: Collected in an EDTA or heparinized tube, must be
centrifuged immediately after collection.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples
• Specimens collected in inappropriate containers
Specimen Stability:
• Serum and plasma are stable for up to 7 days when refrigerated
(2-8°C) or for up to 6 months when frozen (-20°C to -80°C). Avoid
repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
7. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation
1. Prepare the work area, ensuring all equipment is calibrated,
and supplies are ready.
2. Thaw frozen specimens at room temperature and mix well
before analysis. Avoid excessive agitation.
3. Perform a visual inspection of specimens for any signs of
hemolysis or clotting.
B. Calibration and Quality Control
1. Run calibrators and control sera according to manufacturer
instructions.
2. Record calibration data and verify that the instrument is within
specified limits.
3. Run quality control samples (high, normal, and low) and ensure
results are within specified ranges before proceeding with
patient samples.
C. Sample Analysis
1. Follow the instrument’s operating manual to load samples onto
the immunoassay analyzer.
2. Enter patient information into the Laboratory Information
System (LIS) and verify accuracy.
3. Configure the assay according to the Food Panel VIII
parameters outlined by the manufacturer.
4. Load the reagent kit and microtiter plates into the analyzer.
5. Start the run and monitor the process to ensure there are no
instrument errors or alarms.
D. Troubleshooting
1. In case of instrument error, refer to the troubleshooting section
in the instrument manual.
2. If control results fall outside acceptable ranges, repeat the
assay with fresh control samples.
3. Document any corrective actions taken and notify the
supervisor if the issue persists.
8. RESULT INTERPRETATION AND REPORTING
1. Review the generated data for any flagged results or
discrepancies.
2. Verify the results against control samples and reference
standards.
3. Input results into the LIS and validate.
4. If any results fall outside of expected ranges, repeat the test
before validating and reporting.
5. Apply appropriate comments or interpretative notes as needed.
6. Results are to be reviewed and signed off by qualified
personnel before being released to the physician.
9. QUALITY CONTROL AND DOCUMENTATION
1. Maintain a log of all specimen processing, calibrations, controls,
and test runs.
2. Document any deviations from the protocol and corrective
actions taken.
3. Retain records according to laboratory policies and regulatory
requirements.
10. SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS
1. Follow all safety guidelines, including wearing appropriate PPE.
2. Dispose of biological waste in accordance with local regulations
and laboratory safety protocols.
3. Ensure proper handling and storage of reagents to prevent
contamination or degradation.
