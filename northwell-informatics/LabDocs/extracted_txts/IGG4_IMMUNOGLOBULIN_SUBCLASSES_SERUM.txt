Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for IgG4, Immunoglobulin Subclasses,
Serum
1. PURPOSE
To outline the process and ensure the accuracy of analytical
procedures for the determination of IgG4 and other immunoglobulin
subclasses in serum samples utilizing automated and manual
laboratory techniques.
2. PRINCIPLE
Immunoglobulins, including IgG4 and other immunoglobulin
subclasses, are measured in serum samples to assess immune
system function, diagnose immune disorders, and guide treatment
decisions. Measurement is typically performed using immunoassay
methods on automated analyzers.
3. SCOPE
This SOP applies to the analysis of serum samples for IgG4 and
other immunoglobulin subclasses in the clinical laboratory.
4. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of designated laboratory personnel to conduct
the testing accurately according to this SOP, document all data
appropriately, and notify the supervisor in case of any discrepancies
or issues.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Specimen:
◦ 1 mL of clotted blood collected in a red-top tube or serum
separator tube (SST).
◦ Serum must be separated from cells within 2 hours of
collection and stored at 2-8°C for up to 7 days or frozen at
-20°C for longer storage.
• Equipment:
◦ Automated immunoassay analyzer (e.g., Siemens BN II,
Immage 800, etc.)
◦ Centrifuge
◦ Refrigerator (2-8°C)
◦ Freezer (-20°C)
• Reagents:
◦ IgG4 assay reagents and calibrators specific to the
immunoassay analyzer.
◦ Quality control materials (Low, Medium, High levels)
◦ Deionized water
6. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Verify the identity of the serum sample and ensure it is properly
labeled.
2. Centrifuge the blood collection tube at 1,500 x g for 10 minutes
to separate the serum.
3. Transfer the serum to a labeled aliquot tube using a pipette.
Calibration and Quality Control:
1. Calibrate the immunoassay analyzer according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Analyze quality control samples (Low, Medium, High) to verify
accuracy and precision.
3. Verify that the QC results fall within the acceptable range before
proceeding with patient samples.
Sample Analysis:
1. Program the instrument with patient information and test parameters.
2. Load the serum sample onto the designated platform of the immunoassay analyzer.
3. Run the IgG4 test using the instrument's predefined protocol.
4. Review the analyzer’s flags or error codes to ensure the validity of the results.
Interpretation of Results:
1. Document the IgG4 concentration provided by the analyzer.
2. Compare patient results to the reference range established by the laboratory:
- Reference intervals may vary based on the population and the immunoassay used; for example, typical adult serum IgG4 levels may range from 2–121 mg/dL, but verify against current laboratory standards.
Reporting Results:
1. Verify and validate the patient results within the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
2. Document any manual entries accurately and include necessary comments or alerts.
3. Release the validated results to the appropriate medical access systems for clinician review.
Handling Critical Values and Retests:
1. If a result falls outside expected clinical ranges or shows an unusual pattern, recheck the sample and quality control.
2. In case of critical value (e.g., extremely high or low IgG4 levels), immediately notify the referring clinician.
Maintenance and Troubleshooting:
1. Perform routine maintenance of the immunoassay analyzer as specified by the manufacturer.
2. Refer to troubleshooting guidelines if equipment errors occur, and notify the supervisor for persistent issues.
7. QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE
• Document all test results, QC runs, calibrations, and maintenance
activities in the relevant logs.
• Participate in external proficiency testing programs to ensure
accuracy and reliability.
• Maintain records in compliance with CLIA regulations.
8. SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS
• Follow all standard laboratory safety protocols, including the use
of personal protective equipment (PPE).
• Handle all biological samples and reagents as potentially
infectious.
• Dispose of biohazardous materials according to institutional
policies.
