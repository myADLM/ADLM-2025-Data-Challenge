Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Generating Results for
IGG4 Immunostain (Technical Component Only)
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized protocol for the technical component of
performing and generating results for IGG4 immunostain in the
laboratory.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to the analytical phase of processing and staining
tissue specimens for IGG4 immunostain. The specimens have been
previously collected, received, and accessioned.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all designated laboratory personnel to follow
this protocol to ensure accurate and reliable IGG4 immunostain
results. The responsible personnel include laboratory technicians,
technologists, and supervisors.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type:
• Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks
Unacceptable conditions:
• Inadequately fixed tissue samples
• Specimens with gross artifacts
5. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
Equipment:
• Microtome
• Water bath
• Oven
• Humid chamber
• Microscopy slides
• Staining racks
• Automated immunostainer (if applicable)
• Microscope (for assessment)
Reagents:
• Xylene
• Ethanol (100%, 95%, 70%)
• Distilled water
• Heat-induced epitope retrieval solution (e.g., Citrate buffer, pH
6.0)
• Peroxidase blocking reagent
• Protein blocking solution
• Primary antibody: Anti-IGG4 antibody
• Secondary antibody: Biotinylated anti-mouse IgG (if primary
antibody is mouse-derived)
• Streptavidin-HRP conjugate
• DAB (3,3'-diaminobenzidine) substrate
• Hematoxylin
6. PROCEDURE
Sectioning:
1. Cut 4-micron thick sections from the FFPE tissue block using a
microtome.
2. Float sections in a 40-45°C water bath to flatten them.
3. Mount sections on positively charged microscope slides.
4. Dry slides in an oven at 60°C for 1 hour to ensure proper
adhesion of tissue sections.
Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
1. Deparaffinize slides in xylene for 3 changes, 5 minutes each.
2. Rehydrate sections through a series of ethanol: 100% ethanol
(2 changes, 3 minutes each), 95% ethanol (2 minutes), 70%
ethanol (2 minutes).
3. Rinse slides in distilled water for 2 minutes.
Antigen Retrieval:
1. Immerse slides in heat-induced epitope retrieval solution
(citrate buffer, pH 6.0).
2. Place in a microwave or pressure cooker and heat for 15
minutes.
3. Allow slides to cool for 20 minutes at room temperature.
4. Rinse slides in distilled water followed by PBS (phosphate-
buffered saline).
Blocking and Primary Antibody Staining:
1. Incubate slides in peroxidase blocking reagent for 10 minutes to
quench endogenous peroxidase activity.
2. Rinse in PBS.
3. Apply protein blocking solution for 10 minutes to prevent
nonspecific binding.
4. Drain and apply the primary antibody (Anti-IGG4) diluted in
appropriate antibody diluent.
5. Incubate the slides in a humid chamber for 1 hour at room
temperature or overnight at 4°C.
6. Rinse slides in PBS.
Secondary Antibody and Detection:
1. Apply biotinylated secondary antibody for 30 minutes.
2. Rinse in PBS.
3. Apply streptavidin-HRP conjugate and incubate for 30 minutes.
4. Rinse in PBS.
5. Apply DAB substrate and monitor closely for color development
(5-10 minutes).
6. Rinse in distilled water to stop the reaction.
Counterstaining and Mounting:
1. Counterstain slides with hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes.
2. Rinse in running tap water.
3. Dehydrate through increasing ethanol concentrations: 70%
ethanol, 95% ethanol, and 100% ethanol.
4. Clear in xylene (3 changes, 5 minutes each).
5. Mount sections using a permanent mounting medium.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Use positive control slides with known IGG4 expression and
negative control slides (without primary antibody) with each
staining batch.
2. Document and monitor the staining quality in a logbook.
3. Review stained slides under a microscope to ensure adequate
and specific staining.
8. DOCUMENTATION AND RESULT GENERATION
1. Document all reagent lot numbers, times, and temperatures
used in the procedure.
2. Record the staining assessment (positive or negative) and any
observation regarding staining quality.
3. Label and store completed slides appropriately.
9. REFERENCES
1. Manufacturer's instructions for the primary antibody and
reagents.
2. Standard histopathology textbooks and guidelines.
