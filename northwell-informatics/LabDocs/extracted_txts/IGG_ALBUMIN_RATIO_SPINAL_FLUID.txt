Protocol for IGG/ALBUMIN RATIO Analysis in Spinal Fluid
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this protocol is to outline the procedures for analyzing
and generating results for the IgG/Albumin Ratio in spinal fluid
specimens. The IgG/Albumin ratio is used to assess the integrity of
the blood-brain barrier and immunoglobulin production within the
central nervous system.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
2.1 Specimen Type:
• Spinal fluid (cerebrospinal fluid - CSF)
2.2 Collection:
• Collect spinal fluid using aseptic technique.
• A minimum volume of 1 mL of spinal fluid is required for analysis.
• Ensure the specimen is free from blood contamination; if visible
blood is present, the specimen should be considered unsuitable.
2.3 Storage and Transport:
• Spinal fluid specimens should be stored at 2-8°C and transported
to the laboratory as soon as possible.
• Specimens must not be stored more than 72 hours before
analysis.
• If analysis is delayed beyond 72 hours, the specimen should be
aliquoted and frozen at -20°C.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
3.1 Equipment:
• Automated or manual protein electrophoresis system
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Centrifuge
• Refrigerated storage at 2-8°C and -20°C
3.2 Reagents:
• IgG and Albumin standards and controls
• Protein staining reagents
• Dilution buffer (if required by the specific method)
• Deionized water
3.3 Supplies:
• Sample tubes
• Microcentrifuge tubes (for aliquoting and storage)
• Electrophoresis strips or gels
• Laboratory log sheets
1. PROCEDURE
4.1 Pre-Analytical Preparation:
• Verify specimen labeling and check for appropriate volume and
absence of visible contamination.
• Document the receipt of the specimen in the laboratory
information system (LIS).
4.2 Sample Preparation:
• If required, centrifuge the spinal fluid specimens at 2000 x g for 10
minutes to remove any cellular debris.
• Aliquot an appropriate volume of the clear supernatant for
analysis.
4.3 Analytical Procedure:
• Load the spinal fluid sample along with IgG and Albumin
standards onto the protein electrophoresis system according to
manufacturer instructions.
• Run the electrophoresis system for the time specified by the
manufacturer to achieve separation of IgG and Albumin.
• Stain the electrophoresis strip or gel to visualize protein bands,
following the specific staining protocol.
• Scan and analyze the stained electrophoresis strip or gel using an
appropriate imaging system.
• Quantify the intensities of IgG and Albumin bands using the
imaging software provided with the electrophoresis system.
4.4 Calculation:
• Calculate the ratio of IgG to Albumin using the quantified values
from the electrophoresis analysis.
• Record the IgG/Albumin ratio in the laboratory log sheet and LIS.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
5.1 Internal Quality Control:
• Run internal quality control samples along with patient specimens
in each batch of analysis.
• Document and review quality control results to ensure accuracy
and precision are maintained within acceptable limits.
5.2 External Quality Control:
• Participate in proficiency testing programs or external quality
assessment schemes to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the
IgG/Albumin ratio results.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
6.1 Verification:
• Review all raw data and calculated IgG/Albumin ratios for
consistency and accuracy before verification.
• Verify results by comparing with control ranges, and ensure that
all quality control measures have been met.
6.2 Transcription and Reporting:
• Transcribe the verified results into the LIS.
• Ensure that all results are reviewed by a qualified technologist or
supervisor before final report generation.
6.3 Critical Values:
• Notify the appropriate healthcare provider immediately if any
critical or unexpected findings are identified during the analysis.
• Document any communication of critical results in the LIS or
laboratory log.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Ensure control and patient samples are free from hemolysis,
which can interfere with accurate protein quantification.
• Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for the electrophoresis
system and reagents to avoid any technical discrepancies.
