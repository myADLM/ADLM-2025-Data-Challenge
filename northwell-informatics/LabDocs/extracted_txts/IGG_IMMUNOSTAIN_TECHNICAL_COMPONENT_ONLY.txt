Standard Operating Procedure
Title: IgG Immunostain, Technical Component Only
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this SOP is to outline the
procedures for performing the IgG Immunostain, Technical
Component Only, ensuring consistent, accurate, and reliable
staining results for diagnostic use.
2. RESPONSIBILITY This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel
who are responsible for performing immunostains. All personnel
must ensure that procedures are followed correctly and that all
results are documented and communicated appropriately.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS a. Specimen Type: Formalin-
fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue sections. b. Specimen
Thickness: 4-5 microns. c. Specimen Preparation: Ensure all
slides are properly labeled with patient information and
accession number. Sections should be mounted on positively
charged glass slides.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES a. Equipment:
◦ Microtome
◦ Water bath
◦ Oven
◦ Automated immunostainer (e.g., Ventana BenchMark, Dako
Autostainer)
◦ Light microscope b. Reagents:
◦ Primary antibody (IgG specific; refer to the manufacturer's
recommendations)
◦ Secondary antibody (labeled polymer or enzyme-labeled
secondary antibody)
◦ Detection system (chromogen, e.g., DAB solution)
◦ Counterstain (e.g., Hematoxylin)
◦ Mounting medium c. Supplies:
◦ Positively charged slides
◦ Cover slips
◦ Pipettes and tips
◦ Humidity chamber
◦ Xylene (for deparaffinization)
◦ Ethanol (graded series for rehydration)
5. PROCEDURE a. Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
1. Bake slides at 60°C for 1 hour in an oven.
2. Deparaffinize in 3 changes of xylene for 5 minutes each.
3. Rehydrate slides through graded ethanol series (100%,
95%, 70%) for 3 minutes each.
4. Rinse slides in distilled water.
b. Antigen Retrieval:
1. Perform heat-induced epitope retrieval (HIER) using a pressure
cooker or microwave with appropriate buffer (e.g., Citrate buffer,
pH 6.0 or Tris-EDTA buffer, pH 9.0) following manufacturer's
instructions.
2. Allow slides to cool for 20 minutes at room temperature.
3. Rinse slides in distilled water.
c. Immunostaining:
1. Load slides into the automated immunostainer.
2. Apply the primary antibody as per the manufacturer’s
recommended dilution and incubation time.
3. Apply the secondary antibody using the recommended protocol.
4. Apply the detection system (chromogen) and incubate as per
the specified time.
5. Rinse slides thoroughly between each step with appropriate
buffer washes (e.g., Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)).
d. Counterstaining and Mounting:
1. Counterstain slides with Hematoxylin for 30 seconds to 1
minute.
2. Rinse slides in distilled water.
3. Dehydrate slides through graded ethanol series and clear in
xylene.
4. Mount coverslips using an appropriate mounting medium.
5. QUALITY CONTROL a. Include positive and negative controls
with each staining run. b. Ensure all controls show appropriate
staining results before releasing patient results. c. Document
any deviations or issues encountered and notify the supervisor
if any control fails.
6. REPORTING RESULTS a. Document the completion of the
technical component in the laboratory information system (LIS).
b. Ensure all stained slides are reviewed by a pathologist for
diagnostic interpretation.
7. TROUBLESHOOTING a. Weak or no staining:
◦ Check antibody concentrations and incubation times.
◦ Ensure proper antigen retrieval was performed. b. High
background staining:
◦ Optimize blocking steps.
◦ Check for reagent contamination. c. Non-specific staining:
◦ Verify the specificity of the antibody.
◦ Confirm proper washing steps were followed.
8. SAFETY a. Follow all laboratory safety protocols, including the
use of personal protective equipment (PPE). b. Dispose of
waste materials according to established hazardous waste
protocols.
9. REFERENCES a. Manufacturer’s Instructions for Primary and
Secondary Antibodies b. Laboratory Information System (LIS)

10. REVIEW This SOP is to be reviewed annually or upon any
significant procedural changes to ensure accuracy and
compliance.
