Standard Operating Procedure: Analytical Phase of Generating
Immunoglobulin G (IgG), Serum Results
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedures for the analysis of Immunoglobulin G (IgG)
levels in serum specimens. This SOP ensures the accuracy and
reliability of IgG measurements using specified analytical methods,
equipment, and quality control measures.
Responsibility: All laboratory personnel performing IgG serum
analysis are responsible for adhering to this SOP. Supervisors and
Quality Control personnel are responsible for ensuring compliance
and addressing any deviations.
1. DEFINITION
Immunoglobulin G (IgG) is a type of antibody found in blood and
extracellular fluid, which is critical for immune defense. This protocol
ensures accurate quantification of IgG levels in serum samples.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
◦ Preferred Specimen:
▪ Serum: 1-2 mL of serum collected in a serum separator
tube (SST).
◦ Specimen Stability:
▪ Serum specimens should be refrigerated at 2-8°C if not
analyzed immediately and are stable for up to 7 days.
▪ For longer storage, serum specimens should be frozen
at -20°C or lower and are stable for up to 6 months.
◦ Unacceptable Specimens:
▪ Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric specimens are not
acceptable for IgG analysis.
▪ Specimens not meeting volume requirements.
2. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
◦ Equipment:
▪ Automated immunoassay analyzer (e.g., Roche Cobas,
Siemens ADVIA)
◦ Reagents:
▪ IgG reagent kit specific to the analyzer being used, with
appropriate calibrators and controls
◦ Supplies:
▪ Pipettes and tips, serum separator tubes, disposable
gloves, lab coats.
3. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Quality Control Material:
▪ Low, medium, and high IgG control materials should be
used for daily quality control checks.
▪ Controls should be aliquoted and stored according to
manufacturer's instructions.
◦ Procedure:
▪ Run quality controls at the beginning of each shift, with
each new reagent lot, and following instrument
maintenance.
▪ Document the results and ensure they fall within
acceptable ranges before proceeding with patient
samples.
▪ If controls fall outside acceptable range, troubleshoot
according to manufacturer's guidelines and do not
release patient results until issues are resolved.
4. PROCEDURE
Calibration: - Perform calibration using the calibrator provided
by the reagent manufacturer according to the instrument's
protocol. - Document calibration outcomes in the instrument
logbook.
Sample Analysis: 1. Ensure the instrument is properly warmed
up and in ready mode. 2. Verify that the necessary reagents
and supplies are in place and within their expiration dates. 3.
Mix serum samples gently by inversion. 4. Load serum
samples, calibrators, and controls onto the instrument
according to the manufacturer’s specifications. 5. Select the
IgG assay on the instrument software and input the necessary
information. 6. Start the analysis run following the instrument’s
instructions. 7. Review generated results for any flags or errors.
If flagged, refer to troubleshooting section of the manufacturer’s
manual.
Reporting Results: - Results are automatically transmitted to
the Laboratory Information System (LIS) and must be reviewed
by a technologist. - Verify results against control data and
acceptability criteria prior to release. - Any abnormal or critical
values should be communicated to the relevant healthcare
provider immediately.
5. REFERENCE INTERVALS
◦ The reference interval for IgG levels may vary slightly
depending on the specific assay used, but generally:
▪ Adults: 700-1600 mg/dL
▪ Infants and children: Age-specific reference ranges apply
(refer to assay manufacturer's insert or laboratory-
provided reference ranges).
6. TROUBLESHOOTING
◦ If quality control results are out of range:
1. Rerun the control material.
2. Check reagent lot numbers, expiration dates, and
instrument calibration.
3. If issues persist, notify the supervisor and follow
corrective actions per manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ If instrument errors or flags appear, follow the
troubleshooting guide within the instrument’s manual.
7. SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS
◦ Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE)
including gloves and lab coat.
◦ Follow the laboratory’s chemical hygiene and biosafety
guidelines.
