Standard Operating Procedure
for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for IgG
Subclasses, Serum
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this document is to outline the standard operating
procedure (SOP) for the analytical phase of generating results for
Immunoglobulin G (IgG) subclasses in serum in a CLIA-certified
laboratory. This SOP encompasses the handling, preparation, testing,
and documentation of serum samples to ensure accurate and reliable
results.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel involved in the
analysis of IgG subclasses from serum samples within the laboratory.
Compliance with this SOP is mandatory to maintain the integrity and
accuracy of test results.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
Laboratory Personnel:
• Ensure adherence to the protocol.
• Follow safety guidelines and use appropriate PPE.
• Perform specimen handling, sample preparation, and analysis.
• Document and report results accurately.
Supervisors:
• Ensure laboratory personnel are trained and competent in
performing the assay.
• Review and validate results.
• Address any issues or deviations from the protocol.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Accepted Specimens:
• Specimen type: Serum.
• Collection Tubes: Serum Separator Tubes (SST) or plain red-top
tubes.
• Volume: Minimum of 1 mL serum.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens with visible hemolysis or lipemia.
• Samples with insufficient volume.
• Samples not stored or transported under appropriate conditions.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND
SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes and tips
• Vortex mixer
• Incubator
• Analytical balance
• Immunoassay analyzer (e.g., nephelometer or ELISA plate
reader)
Reagents:
• Calibrators and Controls specific for IgG subclasses.
• IgG Subclasses Immunoassay Kit.
• Wash buffer, substrate solution, stop solution, and required
ancillary reagents.
Supplies:
• Microtiter plates (if ELISA method is used)
• Test tubes or sample cups for analyzers
• Plate seals and appropriate labeling material
6. PROCEDURE
A) Specimen Preparation:
1. Centrifugation:
◦ Centrifuge collected serum tubes at 1500-2000 x g for 10-15
minutes at room temperature.
◦ Carefully transfer the supernatant serum to labeled aliquot
tubes avoiding the transfer of any cellular components.
2. Storage:
◦ If samples will be analyzed within 24 hours, store at 2-8°C.
◦ For long-term storage, freeze samples at -20°C or lower.
B) Assay Procedure:
1. Preparation of Reagents and Calibration:
◦ Allow all reagents, controls, and calibrators to reach room
temperature before use.
◦ Prepare the wash buffer and other reagents according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Reconstitute and dilute calibrators and controls as per kit
instructions.
2. Set Up:
◦ Load the microtiter plate or sample rack with prepared
control and patient serum samples.
◦ Add the required volume of sample, controls, and calibrators
to appropriate wells or tubes as specified by the assay
protocol.
3. Incubation:
◦ Add the detection antibody to each well (if using ELISA) and
incubate for the specified duration at the specified
temperature.
◦ Wash the plates as directed between incubation steps to
remove unbound substances.
4. Detection and Reading:
◦ Add the substrate solution and incubate until the color
development is sufficient.
◦ Add the stop solution (for ELISA) and read the plate
immediately on the microplate reader at the specified
wavelength.
◦ For nephelometry, follow the instrument instructions for
detection.
C) Data Analysis:
1. Calculate Concentrations:
◦ Analyze the data using the standard curve and software
provided.
◦ Ensure all controls fall within the expected range before
accepting patient results.
2. Quality Control:
◦ Run quality control specimens with each batch of tests.
◦ Document and evaluate control results using Levy-Jennings
charts.
◦ Investigate and document any deviations or outliers.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Documentation:
◦ Record all results in the laboratory information system (LIS).
◦ Ensure that patient identifiers and sample details match.
2. Verification:
◦ Review each result for accuracy.
◦ Verify any critical values or unexpected results as per
laboratory protocol.
3. Result Interpretation:
◦ Reference ranges for IgG subclasses should be noted and
used to interpret patient results.
◦ Flag any abnormal values for further review by the
pathologist or supervising clinician.
8. SAFETY AND WASTE DISPOSAL
• Follow all laboratory safety guidelines. Utilize personal protective
equipment (PPE) and work in designated areas.
• Dispose of biohazard waste and chemical reagents according to
local regulations and laboratory protocol.
