Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase for Generating Results for IGH Somatic
Hypermutation Analysis in B-Cell Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (B-
CLL)
1. Purpose:
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedures for the analytical phase of generating results for Immunoglobulin Heavy Chain (IGH) Somatic Hypermutation (SHM) analysis in patients diagnosed with B-Cell Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (B-CLL).
2. Scope:
This procedure applies to all staff members in the molecular diagnostic laboratory of the CLIA-certified laboratory, who are involved in the IGH SHM analysis for B-CLL.
3. Definitions:
B-CLL: B-Cell Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia, a type of cancer that affects a group of white blood cells called lymphocytes.
IGH: Immunoglobulin Heavy Chain, a part of the immune system antibodies.
SHM: Somatic Hypermutation, the process by which B-cells mutate the IGH gene to produce high-affinity antibodies.
4. Responsibilities:
It is the responsibility of the molecular diagnostic laboratory's technologists to perform the analysis as outlined in this SOP.
The laboratory supervisor is responsible for ensuring that all personnel follow these procedures and that quality control (QC) is maintained.
5. Required Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies:
• PCR thermocycler
• Agarose gel electrophoresis apparatus
• DNA extraction kit
• IGH-specific primers
• Taq polymerase, dNTPs, and PCR buffer
• SYBR Green dye or DNA staining dye
• Sequencing reagents and equipment (e.g., Next-Generation Sequencing platform or Sanger Sequencer)
• Sterile pipette tips and microcentrifuge tubes
• Positive and negative control DNA samples
6. Procedures:
A. **DNA Extraction:**
• Extract genomic DNA from the patient's peripheral blood or bone marrow sample using a DNA extraction kit according to the manufacturer's protocol.
• Quantify and assess the purity of extracted DNA using a spectrophotometer.
B. **PCR Amplification of IGH:**
• Prepare a PCR master mix including:
o IGH-specific forward and reverse primers
o dNTPs
o Taq polymerase and buffer
o DNA template (extracted from the patient sample)
• Set up the PCR thermocycler under the following conditions:
o Initial denaturation at 95°C for 5 minutes
o 35 cycles of:
- Denaturation at 95°C for 30 seconds
- Annealing at 58-62°C (depending on primers) for 30 seconds
- Extension at 72°C for 1 minute
o Final extension at 72°C for 10 minutes
• Include appropriate positive and negative controls in each PCR run.
C. **Electrophoresis:**
• Load PCR products onto an agarose gel stained with SYBR Green dye or an equivalent.
• Perform gel electrophoresis to confirm successful amplification of the IGH gene.
• Visualize and document the electrophoresis results using a gel imager.
D. **IGH Sequencing:**
• Purify the confirmed PCR product using a PCR purification kit.
• Prepare the purified PCR product for sequencing using the chosen sequencing platform (Next-Generation Sequencing or Sanger Sequencing).
• Follow the sequencing platform's specific protocol for sample preparation, sequencing, and data collection.
E. **Data Analysis:**
• Analyze sequencing data to identify the presence and frequency of IGH somatic hypermutations.
• Compare patient sequence data against reference IGH sequences (e.g., IMGT database) to calculate mutation frequency.
• Interpret mutation status according to established guidelines for B-CLL prognosis.
7. Quality Control:
• Include positive and negative controls in every batch of PCR amplification and sequencing.
• Regularly evaluate performance using established quality control materials.
• Document all QC results, addressing any deviations or issues.
8. Reporting Results:
• Review and verify results by two independent technologists.
• Enter verified results into the laboratory information system (LIS).
• Generate a report with the following details:
o Patient identification information
o Description of the IGH SHM analysis and methodologies
o Mutation frequencies and interpretation
o Any relevant clinical interpretation or prognosis for B-CLL
• Provide the report to the requesting healthcare provider, ensuring confidentiality and accuracy.
