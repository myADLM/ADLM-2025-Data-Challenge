Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Generating Results for IGM
Immunostain, Technical Component Only
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedures for performing
IgM immunostain, technical component only, in a CLIA-certified
laboratory.
Responsibility:
Laboratory technologists performing the IgM immunostain will follow
the established procedures in this SOP. Supervisors will ensure
compliance and address any procedural deficiencies.
1. DEFINITION
IgM immunostain: An immunohistochemical staining technique used
to detect IgM antibodies in tissue samples.
1. PROCEDURE
A) Specimen Requirements
Acceptable Specimens:
• Freshly collected tissue samples fixed in 10% neutral buffered
formalin.
• Paraffin-embedded tissue blocks.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Tissue samples that are improperly fixed.
• Tissue samples that are dried out or otherwise compromised.
B) Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies
• Microtome for sectioning paraffin-embedded blocks.
• Water bath for floating tissue sections.
• Coated glass slides.
• Immunohistochemistry staining equipment (e.g., automated
stainer).
• Primary IgM antibody.
• Detection reagents for HRP-based or ALP-based systems.
• Counterstain (e.g., hematoxylin).
• Mounting medium.
• Coverslips.
C) Procedure
1. Specimen Preparation:
• Cut 4-5 micron sections from paraffin-embedded tissue blocks
using a microtome.
• Float sections in a water bath at 37°C and pick them up on coated
glass slides.
• Dry slides at 60°C for at least 30 minutes.
1. Deparaffinization:
• Deparaffinize sections by immersing in xylenes, followed by
rehydration through graded alcohols into distilled water.
1. Antigen Retrieval:
• Perform antigen retrieval using heat-induced epitope retrieval
(HIER) in a citrate buffer (pH 6.0) at 95°C for 20 minutes, followed
by cooling in buffer for 20 minutes.
• Alternatively, use enzymatic retrieval with pepsin for 10 minutes at
37°C (verify the appropriate method as per antibody
specifications).
1. Blocking:
• Place slides in blocking solution for 10 minutes to reduce non-
specific binding.
1. Primary Antibody Incubation:
• Apply the primary IgM antibody on the sections and incubate for
the specified time (e.g., 30 minutes to 1 hour) at room
temperature or longer at 4°C, as recommended by the antibody
manufacturer.
• Rinse slides in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or Tris-buffered
saline (TBS).
1. Detection System:
• Apply HRP or ALP conjugated secondary antibody or polymer
according to the detection kit instructions.
• Incubate sections with the chromogen (e.g., DAB for HRP, Fast
Red for ALP) for the appropriate duration.
• Rinse slides in distilled water.
1. Counterstaining:
• Counterstain with hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes.
• Rinse slides in tap water and dry.
1. Mounting:
• Apply mounting medium and coverslip.
• Allow slides to dry completely.
D) Quality Control
• Include positive control tissues known to contain IgM.
• Include negative controls by omitting the primary antibody.
• Document quality control results and any corrective actions taken.
E) Reporting Results
Technical results will be generated based on staining intensity and
localization of IgM. Interpretation will be done by a pathologist.
1. Review stained slides under a microscope.
2. Record the staining quality, presence, and localization of IgM.
3. Flag any quality control issues and address them in
collaboration with a supervisor.
4. Submit the stained slides for pathologist review.
F) Method Limitations
• False negatives may occur due to improper fixation or inadequate
antigen retrieval.
• False positives may arise from non-specific binding or tissue
artifacts.
• Refer to the primary antibody’s product insert for specific
limitations and troubleshooting.

• Primary antibody manufacturer's insert.
• Immunohistochemistry staining kit instructions.
• Quality control documentation requirements.
Appendices:
• Sample quality control log template.
• Troubleshooting guide for common staining issues.
• Contact information for supervisors and technical support.
This protocol is effective as of October 2023 and will be reviewed
annually for any necessary updates.
