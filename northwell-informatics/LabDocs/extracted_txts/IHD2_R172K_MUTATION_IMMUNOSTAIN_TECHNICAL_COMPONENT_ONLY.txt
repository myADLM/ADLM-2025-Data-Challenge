Immunostain - Technical Component Only
Effective Date: [Insert Date]
Review Date: [Insert Date]
Approvals:
• Laboratory Director
• Quality Assurance Coordinator
1. PURPOSE
This SOP details the procedure for the analytical phase of generating
results for the IHD2, R172K Mutation using immunostaining
techniques. This document covers standard operating steps to
ensure accurate and consistent staining and results for IHD2, R172K
mutation detection.
2. SCOPE
This protocol applies to all laboratory personnel trained in
immunohistochemical staining procedures at [Lab Name]. This SOP
is for the technical component only and does not include
interpretation by a pathologist.
3. RESPONSIBILITIES
• Laboratory Technologists/Technicians: Follow the procedures
outlined, ensure equipment calibration, perform QC checks,
document results, and report any discrepancies to the supervisor.
• Quality Assurance: Ensure compliance with SOP, perform
periodic audits, and validate QC data.
• Supervisors: Oversee procedure compliance, provide training
and handle escalations regarding any issues or discrepancies.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE)
tissue blocks.
• Slide Preparation: Provide two (2) unstained slides from FFPE
tissue for IHD2, R172K mutation testing.
• Storage Conditions: Store FFPE blocks at room temperature.
Unstained slides should be stored at 2-8°C and used within 2
weeks of preparation.
5. REAGENTS AND MATERIALS
• Primary antibody: Anti-IHD2 (R172K) [Provide specific supplier
details and catalog number]
• Secondary antibody: [List appropriate secondary antibody]
• Detection system: [List detection kit]
• Counterstain: Hematoxylin
• Wash buffers: PBS (Phosphate Buffered Saline) or TBS (Tris
Buffered Saline)
• Mounting medium: [List recommended mounting medium]
6. EQUIPMENT
• Automated IHC Staining Platform (if available)
• Microtome
• Water Bath
• Incubator
• Microscopy equipment for evaluating stains
• Calibration equipment for routine checks
7. PROCEDURE
A. Slide Preparation
1. Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
◦ Bake slides at 60°C for 1 hour.
◦ Deparaffinize slides in xylene for 3 x 5 minutes.
◦ Rehydrate through graded alcohols (100%, 95%, 70%) to
distilled water.
2. Antigen Retrieval:
◦ Place slides in preheated antigen retrieval buffer (e.g. citrate
buffer pH 6.0 or EDTA pH 9.0).
◦ Perform heat-induced epitope retrieval using microwave or
pressure cooker as per reagent manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Allow slides to cool to room temperature.
B. Immunostaining
1. Primary Antibody Incubation:
◦ Block endogenous peroxidase and non-specific binding
sites as per the detection system instructions.
◦ Incubate slides with the diluted primary antibody (Anti-IHD2,
R172K) for [Specify duration and temperature].
2. Secondary Antibody Incubation:
◦ Wash slides in PBS or TBS buffer.
◦ Incubate with an appropriate secondary antibody conjugated
with HRP or AP for [Specify duration and temperature].
3. Detection and Visualization:
◦ Apply chromogen according to manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Monitor the staining under a microscope to avoid
overdevelopment.
4. Counterstaining:
◦ Dip slides in hematoxylin for counterstaining.
◦ Wash in running tap water and perform bluing step.
C. Slide Mounting
1. Dehydration and Clearing:
◦ Rinse slides in graded alcohols and xylene.
◦ Ensure slides are completely dehydrated before mounting.
2. Mounting:
◦ Apply mounting medium and coverslip carefully ensuring no
air bubbles.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include positive and negative control slides with each batch.
• Validate control results before reporting patient results.
• Document all QC activities in the QC log.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
• Document the staining pattern and intensity in the laboratory
information system.
• Ensure slides are reviewed and initialed by the technologist.
• Forward the results to the pathologist for interpretation.
