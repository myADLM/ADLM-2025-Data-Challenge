Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analysis of Imipramine
and Desipramine in Serum
1. PURPOSE: To outline the procedure for the accurate and
precise determination of Imipramine and Desipramine in serum
samples utilizing LC-MS/MS (Liquid Chromatography-tandem
Mass Spectrometry).
2. RESPONSIBILITY: Laboratory personnel responsible for
operating the LC-MS/MS system must adhere to this SOP to
ensure uniformity and consistency in the testing process.
Technicians must identify and report abnormal test results or
equipment malfunctions to their supervisors immediately.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS: A. Specimen Type: Serum B.
Specimen Collection: Collect 5 mL of blood using a red-top or
SST tube. Ensure proper labeling. C. Specimen Stability:
Serum should be stable for 7 days when refrigerated at 2-8°C
or 12 months when frozen at -20°C. D. Unacceptable Criteria:
◦ Hemolyzed specimens
◦ Lipemic specimens
◦ Specimens collected in anticoagulant tubes (e.g., EDTA,
heparin)
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES: A. LC-MS/MS
Instrument B. Mobile phases (Water and Acetonitrile with 0.1%
Formic Acid) C. Calibrators and Controls for Imipramine and
Desipramine D. Solid Phase Extraction (SPE) cartridges or
equivalent E. Serum Separator Tubes (SST) F. Vortex Mixer,
Centrifuge, Pipettes, and Tips G. Calibration Standards and
Internal Standards H. Analytical Columns for LC-MS/MS
5. CALIBRATION AND CONTROLS: A. Calibration Curves:
◦ Prepare and analyze a calibration curve consisting of at
least six standard points ranging from the lower limit of
quantitation (LLOQ) to the upper limit of quantitation
(ULOQ) of Imipramine and Desipramine. B. Quality
Controls:
◦ Use commercially available high, medium, and low
concentration controls for Imipramine and Desipramine to
validate the assay performance.
6. PROCEDURE: A. Sample Preparation:
1. Thaw frozen serum samples and allow them to reach
room temperature.
2. Vortex samples to ensure uniformity.
3. Perform protein precipitation followed by solid phase
extraction (SPE) according to the validated extraction
protocol.
4. Elute compounds from SPE cartridges and dry under
nitrogen stream.
5. Reconstitute the dried extract in an appropriate volume of
mobile phase before LC-MS/MS analysis.
B. Instrument Setup and Operation:
1. Set up the LC-MS/MS system according to manufacturer
specifications.
2. Condition the analytical column with the mobile phase.
3. Inject the reconstituted sample (10-20 μL) into the LC-MS/
MS system.
4. Use the following LC gradient:
▪ Initial: 80% Water/ 20% Acetonitrile for 2 minutes
▪ Linear gradient to 20% Water/80% Acetonitrile over 6
minutes
▪ Hold at 20% Water/80% Acetonitrile for 2 minutes
▪ Return to initial conditions and re-equilibrate for 3
minutes
5. Monitor specific mass transitions for Imipramine and
Desipramine, along with the internal standard.
7. CALCULATION AND REPORTING OF RESULTS: A. Generate
a calibration curve by plotting the peak area ratios (analyte/
internal standard) against concentrations. B. Calculate the
concentration of Imipramine and Desipramine in serum
samples from the calibration curve using linear regression
analysis. C. Verify that control samples are within the
acceptable range. D. Document all results in the LIS with
technician initials and the date of analysis. E. Report results
according to the reference intervals for Imipramine and
Desipramine:
◦ Therapeutic Range:
▪ Imipramine: 150-300 ng/mL
▪ Desipramine: 100-250 ng/mL
8. QUALITY CONTROL: A. Ensure that all controls are within
acceptable limits before reporting patient results. B. All
calibrations, quality control runs, and instrument performance
checks must be logged in the laboratory QC records.
9. TROUBLESHOOTING: A. If QC results are outside acceptable
limits, investigate for potential issues such as: - Instrumental
errors - Reagent or standard degradation - Improper sample
preparation B. Perform corrective actions as needed, re-
calibrate if necessary, and repeat QC. C. Do not report patient
results until QC issues are resolved.
