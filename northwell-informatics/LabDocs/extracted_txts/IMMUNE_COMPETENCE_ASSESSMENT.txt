Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Immune Competence Assessment
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to ensure accurate, reliable, and timely
results for immune competence assessment by defining the
procedures for the analytical phase, including the operation and
maintenance of relevant equipment, quality control, and result
validation.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
• Designated laboratory staff are responsible for carrying out the
steps outlined in this procedure, ensuring adherence to quality
control protocols, validating results, and reporting them in a timely
manner. • All staff members should be aware of and address any
potential deviations in the procedure, bringing them to the attention of
a supervisor.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred specimen: Whole blood collected in EDTA tubes. •
Specimen volume: A minimum of 4 mL of whole blood is required. •
Specimen stability: Process the specimen within 24 hours of
collection. If the specimen cannot be processed immediately, store at
2-8°C and process within 24 hours.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Flow cytometer (e.g., BD FACSCanto, Beckman Coulter CytoFLEX)
• Reagents: - Fluorochrome-conjugated monoclonal antibodies
(specific to CD markers such as CD3, CD4, CD8, CD19, CD56, etc.)
- 1X PBS (Phosphate Buffered Saline) - FACS lysing solution or
similar erythrocyte lysing reagent • Controls: - Commercially available
control cells • Software for data acquisition and analysis
1. PROCEDURE
A) Specimen Preparation
1. Bring collected blood specimen to room temperature.
2. Label tubes appropriately with patient identifier, date, and time.
3. Aliquot 100 µL of whole blood into appropriate number of FACS
tubes (one tube per antibody panel).
B) Staining Procedure
1. Add the fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies to each tube
according to the specific panel layout:
◦ T-cell panel: anti-CD3, anti-CD4, anti-CD8
◦ B-cell panel: anti-CD19
◦ NK-cell panel: anti-CD56, anti-CD3
2. Incubate tubes in the dark at room temperature for 15-20
minutes.
3. Add 2 mL of 1X FACS lysing solution to each tube, mix gently,
and incubate for 10-15 minutes in the dark.
4. Centrifuge the tubes at 500 x g for 5 minutes and discard the
supernatant.
5. Wash cells by adding 2 mL of 1X PBS, mixing gently, and
centrifuging at 500 x g for 5 minutes. Discard the supernatant.
6. Repeat the wash step once more.
C) Data Acquisition
1. Resuspend the cell pellet in 300–500 µL of 1X PBS or sheath
fluid.
2. Acquire data on the flow cytometer using appropriate
instrument settings and compensation controls.
3. Run quality control samples to ensure instrument performance
before acquiring patient samples.
4. Acquire 10,000–50,000 events per sample tube as specified in
the protocol.
D) Data Analysis
1. Use flow cytometry analysis software to gate on the lymphocyte
population based on FSC (Forward Scatter) and SSC (Side
Scatter) properties.
2. Analyze the expression of specific CD markers within the gated
population to identify subpopulations (e.g., CD3+ T cells,
CD3+CD4+ helper T cells, CD3+CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, CD19+
B cells, CD3-CD56+ NK cells).
3. Calculate the percentage and absolute counts of each
subpopulation.
E) Quality Control
1. Perform daily instrument calibration using standard calibration
beads.
2. Run control samples with known cell population percentages to
verify assay performance.
3. Document all quality control checks, including corrective actions
if needed.
F) Result Validation and Reporting
1. Review and validate the acquired data, ensuring it is within
acceptable quality control limits.
2. If results are outside the reference range or if technical errors
are detected, re-process or re-analyze the sample as needed.
3. Report results in the LIS (Laboratory Information System)
following site-specific reporting guidelines.
4. For critical results, promptly communicate the findings to the
designated physician or healthcare provider.
5. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Reference intervals may vary by laboratory and population. Establish
intervals based on local population data or refer to literature values.
Example reference intervals might include: • CD3+ T cells: 60-85% of
lymphocytes • CD4+ T cells: 30-55% of lymphocytes • CD8+ T cells:
10-40% of lymphocytes • CD19+ B cells: 5-20% of lymphocytes •
CD56+ NK cells: 5-20% of lymphocytes
1. DOCUMENTATION
Maintain thorough records in the Temperature Monitoring Log, Quality
Control Log, and Patient Result Log. Verify that all reagent and
control lot numbers are properly documented.
