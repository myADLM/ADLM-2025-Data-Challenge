Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical
Phase of Generating Results for Immune Deficiency
Assessment
1. PURPOSE
To outline the standard operating procedures for the analytical phase
of generating results for immune deficiency assessment, ensuring
accurate, reliable, and timely reporting of patient results.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all CLIA-certified laboratory personnel
performing immune deficiency assessments, including the use of flow
cytometry, ELISA, and other immunological assays.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Laboratory technologists are responsible for performing the
analytical procedures as outlined in this SOP.
• Supervisors and technical directors are responsible for ensuring
adherence to this SOP and addressing any issues that may arise
during the analytical phase.
4. DEFINITION
Immune deficiency assessment involves a battery of tests to evaluate
the immune system's functionality, including the enumeration of
lymphocyte subsets, immunoglobulin levels, and specific antibody
responses.
5. PROCEDURE
A) Specimen Preparation
1. Verification:
◦ Confirm specimen identity and accession number.
◦ Check specimen integrity and suitability (e.g., whole blood,
serum, plasma).
◦ Ensure all specimens are within the acceptable timeframe
for processing.
2. Storage:
◦ Store specimens at appropriate temperatures until analysis.
◦ Use refrigerated or frozen storage as required by specific
assays.
B) Analytical Testing
1. Flow Cytometry
Principle: Flow cytometry is used to enumerate and characterize
lymphocyte subsets (e.g., CD4, CD8, B cells, NK cells).
Materials:
• Flow cytometer (validated & maintained)
• Fluorescently labeled antibodies (CD markers)
• Sheath fluid
• PBS buffer
• Blood specimens (anticoagulated with EDTA)
Procedure:
1. Prepare single-cell suspensions by lysing red blood cells using
a lysing solution.
2. Wash cells with PBS buffer.
3. Resuspend cell pellets in staining buffer and incubate with
fluorescently labeled antibodies for 20-30 minutes at 4°C in the
dark.
4. Wash cells to remove unbound antibodies.
5. Resuspend cells in PBS and run on flow cytometer.
6. Acquire data and analyze using appropriate software.
Quality Control:
• Run daily QC with known control beads.
• Validate each batch run with internal and external controls.
• Document all QC results.
2. Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)
Principle: ELISA is used to quantify immunoglobulins (IgG, IgA, IgM)
and specific antibody responses (e.g., against tetanus, diphtheria).
Materials:
• ELISA reader and washer
• Standard curves and controls
• Assay-specific reagents (coated plates, conjugates, substrates)
Procedure:
1. Prepare standards, controls, and patient samples according to
the assay kit instructions.
2. Add samples and standards to pre-coated ELISA plates.
3. Incubate plates as specified in the protocol.
4. Wash plates to remove unbound substances.
5. Add detection reagents and incubate as specified.
6. Read absorbance at the specified wavelength using ELISA
reader.
7. Generate a standard curve and calculate concentrations in
patient samples.
Quality Control:
• Run controls with each assay batch.
• Document the lot number and expiration dates of reagents.
• Analyze QC results and take corrective actions if needed.
3. Other Immunological Assays
Principle: Additional assays such as functional antibody assays or
neutrophil function tests (e.g., oxidative burst test, phagocytosis
assay) may be performed to assess immune function.
Materials:
• Specific reagents and kits based on the assay type.
• Appropriate detection instruments (e.g., luminometer,
fluorometer).
Procedure: Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for preparing
reagents, handling samples, and performing the assay steps. Ensure
proper incubation, washing, and detection conditions as specified.
Quality Control:
• Implement lot-specific controls.
• Verify results with known positive and negative controls.
• Document all steps for traceability.
C) Data Analysis and Interpretation
1. Collect data from the instruments used.
2. Ensure analysis is performed using validated software or
calculation methods.
3. Verify that all control results are within acceptable ranges
before releasing patient results.
4. Interpret data in the context of clinical reference intervals or
established guidelines.
D) Reporting Results
1. Validation:
◦ Ensure all results are reviewed by a qualified technologist.
◦ Double-check any abnormal or critical values.
2. Documentation:
◦ Record all findings in the laboratory information system
(LIS).
◦ Attach interpretation comments if necessary.
3. Communication:
◦ Report critical findings to the requesting clinician
immediately.
◦ Ensure proper documentation of communication.
E) Quality Assurance and Troubleshooting
1. Regularly review and update SOPs.
2. Participate in external quality assessment programs.
3. Address any discrepancies or errors immediately.
4. Implement corrective and preventive actions as necessary.
