STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP)
Title: Immunofixation, CSF - Analytical Phase
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the analytical phase of
immunofixation electrophoresis (IFE) on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
specimens to ensure accurate and reliable test results.
Responsibility: It is the responsibility of the laboratory personnel to
carry out and document the analytical process for immunofixation on
CSF specimens according to the following procedures. The
supervisors are accountable for ensuring that these procedures are
adhered to and for addressing any discrepancies or issues that arise
during the testing process.
1. SCOPE
This SOP applies to the analytical phase of immunofixation
electrophoresis (IFE) on CSF specimens within the laboratory.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type:
• Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
Specimen Collection:
• The CSF specimen should be collected by lumbar puncture and
transferred immediately into a sterile screw-cap tube.
Specimen Volume:
• A minimum of 1 mL of CSF is required for the IFE test.
Specimen Handling:
• Specimens should be transported to the laboratory immediately
and kept refrigerated at 2-8°C.
• Centrifuge CSF specimens at 1,500-2,000 RPM for 10 minutes at
room temperature if particulate matter is present.
Specimen Stability:
• CSF specimens are stable up to 48 hours under refrigeration. If
extended storage is necessary, specimens must be frozen at
-20°C.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens with gross contamination, excessive hemolysis, or
visible turbidity.
• Specimens that have been stored at room temperature for more
than 4 hours or not refrigerated within 1 hour of collection.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Electrophoresis system
• Power supply
• Staining and washing apparatus
• Densitometer/scanner
• Refrigerator (2-8°C)
• Freezer (-20°C)
Reagent Kit:
• Immunofixation Electrophoresis Kit (Ensure to validate the expired
date and proper storage conditions as specified by the
manufacturer)
Working Reagents:
• Anode and cathode buffers
• Staining solution (Amido Black or equivalent)
• Destaining/washing solutions
Supplies:
• Gel holder and gels (agarose or equivalent)
• Applicator
• Pipettes and tips
• Microscope slides and coverslips
• Disposable gloves
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
Quality Control Materials:
• Commercial control serum (positive and negative controls)
1. PROCEDURE
2. Preparation:
◦ Wear personal protective equipment, including gloves and
lab coat.
◦ Prepare all reagents and buffers as per the manufacturer's
guidelines.
◦ Set up the electrophoresis system.
3. Sample Loading:
◦ Pipette 1-2 μL of CSF sample onto designated sample wells
on the agarose gel.
◦ Load control samples (positive and negative) alongside
patient specimens.
4. Electrophoresis:
◦ Place the gel in the electrophoresis chamber and cover with
buffer according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Connect the chamber to the power supply and run the gel
under specified voltage and duration (e.g., 100-150 volts for
30-60 minutes).
5. Immunofixation:
◦ After electrophoresis, remove the gel and apply the specific
antisera for IgG, IgA, IgM, kappa, and lambda chains
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Incubate the gel for the recommended time (e.g., 10-20
minutes at room temperature) to allow antigen-antibody
complexes to form.
6. Washing and Staining:
◦ Wash the gel thoroughly to remove unbound antibodies.
◦ Stain the gel using the suitable staining solution (e.g., Amido
Black) and follow with the specified destaining protocol to
visualize the protein bands.
7. Analysis:
◦ Dry the gel if required, and scan using an appropriate
densitometer or equivalent scanner.
◦ Analyze the scanned gel and compare the immunofixation
patterns of the patient’s CSF to the control specimens.
8. Documentation:
◦ Record the patient information, sample details, the lot
number of reagents used, and staff initial.
◦ Document quality control results.
◦ Interpret the findings and enter results in the Laboratory
Information System (LIS) for review and verification by the
supervisor or designated personnel.
9. QUALITY CONTROL
• Both positive and negative control samples must be run alongside
patient samples on each gel to ensure assay accuracy.
• Control sample results should be within the expected range. If
control results fall outside acceptable limits, troubleshoot and
retest affected samples.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results should be reviewed and verified against the QC logs
before reporting.
• Results should be reported in a standardized format according to
the laboratory’s protocol.
• Critical findings should be communicated immediately to the
attending physician or responsible clinician.
