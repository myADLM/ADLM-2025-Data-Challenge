Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Immunofixation
Electrophoresis (IFE), Serum
1. PURPOSE To outline the procedure for performing serum
Immunofixation Electrophoresis (IFE) to identify and
characterize monoclonal proteins (M-proteins or paraproteins)
and ensure accurate results.
2. SCOPE This protocol applies to the Immunology section of the
laboratory conducting the Immunofixation Electrophoresis (IFE)
on serum samples.
3. RESPONSIBILITY Designated laboratory personnel are
responsible for:
• Performing the analysis according to this SOP.
• Ensuring proper instrument calibration and maintenance.
• Validating and verifying the results.
• Documenting all procedural details and results in the appropriate
Laboratory Information System (LIS).
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Serum
• Collection Container: Clot activator tube (red top tube) or serum
separator tube (SST)
• Volume Required: Minimum 1 mL of serum
• Specimen Stability: Serum is stable for 7 days at 2-8°C. For long-
term storage, freeze at -20°C.
1. EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
• Serum samples
• IFE agarose gel
• Electrophoresis chamber
• Power supply
• Staining and destaining solutions
• Gel documentation and imaging system
• Incubator (37°C)
1. REAGENTS
• IFE kit reagents (samples match antibodies, etc.)
• Buffer solutions: Tris-Borate (pH 8.6) or as specified by the kit
manufacturer
• Protein fixative
• Staining solution (e.g., Coomassie Brilliant Blue)
• Destaining solution
1. PROCEDURE
Preparation: a. Verify that all equipment, reagents, and supplies are
available and not expired. b. Allow the reagents to reach room
temperature before starting the procedure if stored at refrigerated
temperatures.
Electrophoresis: a. Prewarm the electrophoresis buffer to room
temperature. b. Prepare the IFE agarose gel as per the
manufacturer's instructions. c. Load 5–10 µL of serum sample into
each designated well on the agarose gel. d. Apply the voltage
according to the manufacturer’s specifications. Typically,
electrophoresis is conducted for 30 minutes at a specific voltage to
separate the proteins in the serum sample by their size and charge.
Immunofixation: a. After electrophoresis, carefully overlay specific
antiserum solutions (anti-γ, anti-α, anti-μ, anti-kappa, and anti-
lambda) onto the gel regions where separated serum proteins are
expected. b. Incubate the gel with antisera appropriately in an
incubator according to manufacturers’ instructions. c. Wash the gel to
remove unbound antibodies.
Staining: a. Stain the gel using the prepared staining reagent,
ensuring complete staining of protein bands. b. Destain the gel to
remove any excess stain, enabling clear visualization of the protein
bands.
Documentation and Analysis: a. Place the stained/destained gel on
the documenting system. b. Capture a digital image of the gel. c.
Analyze the bands using appropriate software or visually, comparing
the patient's samples to the control and standard patterns. d. Identify
and document the presence of any monoclonal protein bands.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Run known positive and negative controls alongside patient
samples.
◦ Document the control results and ensure the diagnostic
accuracy of the immunofixation results.
◦ Perform routine maintenance and calibration of equipment
per manufacturer guidelines.
2. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ Review and validate the results obtained from analyzed IFE
gels.
◦ Document results in the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
◦ Report findings, including any identified monoclonal
proteins, to the requesting physician.
3. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Normal reference ranges include a lack of monoclonal (M) protein
bands.
• Patterns noted in positive controls should correspond to expected
results.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Ensure proper sample handling to prevent degradation.
• Incorrect gel application or buffer preparation can affect
separation.
• Lack of antigen-antibody specificity or low-level monoclonal
proteins may yield false results.
