PROTOCOL: IMMUNOFIXATION ELECTROPHORESIS
(IFE), URINE WITH INTERPRETATION (Analytical
Phase)
1. PURPOSE
To provide a consistent and standardized procedure for
performing immunofixation electrophoresis on urine samples,
ensuring accurate detection and characterization of monoclonal
proteins.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of designated laboratory personnel to
perform immunofixation electrophoresis on urine samples
according to this protocol. It is also their duty to ensure proper
documentation, quality control, and follow-up of any
abnormalities encountered during the process.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
◦ Electrophoresis chamber and power supply
◦ Immunofixation gels (e.g., Hydragel IFE)
◦ Specific antisera (Anti-IgG, Anti-IgA, Anti-IgM, Anti-kappa,
Anti-lambda)
◦ Substrate reagents for visualization
◦ Urine collection containers
◦ Dilution tubes and pipettes
◦ Gel documentation system
◦ Control samples
◦ Personal protective equipment (PPE)
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
◦ Collect a minimum of 50 mL of freshly voided urine.
◦ Transport to the laboratory within 24 hours of collection,
stored at 2-8°C if delayed.
◦ Unacceptable: Samples with significant hematuria or other
contaminants that may interfere with electrophoresis.
5. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation and Initial Setup:
1. Sample Preparation:
▪ Centrifuge urine specimens at 1500g for 10 minutes to
remove particulate matter.
▪ Transfer supernatant to a clean tube.
▪ Dilute the urine sample as needed (typically in a ratio
of 1:10 to 1:100) with saline to achieve optimal protein
concentration for electrophoresis.
2. Gel Preparation:
▪ Follow the manufacturer's instruction for gel
preparation and setup.
▪ Mark the gel to indicate wells for control and patient
samples.
B) Electrophoresis:
1. Loading Samples:
▪ Apply prepared urine samples and control samples
into the wells of the agarose gel.
▪ Load antisera into the designated wells.
2. Running the Gel:
▪ Connect the electrophoresis apparatus to the power
supply.
▪ Run the gel at a constant voltage (typically 100-200
volts) for a specified period (usually 30-60 minutes)
until the separation is adequate.
3. Immunofixation:
▪ Once electrophoresis is completed, overlay the gel
with specific antisera (Anti-IgG, Anti-IgA, Anti-IgM,
Anti-kappa, and Anti-lambda).
▪ Incubate according to the manufacturer’s
specifications, usually at room temperature for a
prescribed time.
C) Visualization and Documentation:
1. Substrate Application:
▪ Apply substrate reagents to visualize the immune
complexes.
▪ Incubate and wash the gel as per the reagent
manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Documentation:
▪ Place the gel on the documentation system.
▪ Capture and print the image for interpretation.
D) Quality Control:
1. Control Samples:
▪ Run positive and negative control samples with each
batch to ensure the accuracy of the assay.
▪ Document the results of control samples for each run.
2. Troubleshooting:
▪ Investigate and rectify any anomalies in control results
before reporting patient results.
▪ Common troubleshooting steps include adjusting
sample and antisera volumes, verifying the integrity of
reagents, and ensuring proper electrophoresis
conditions.
6. INTERPRETATION AND REPORTING
◦ Review the immunofixation pattern to identify monoclonal,
oligoclonal, or polyclonal bands.
◦ Compare patient samples against the control samples for
accurate identification.
◦ Identify and document heavy and light chains specificity.
A) Interpretation:
◦ Identify the presence of monoclonal proteins and determine
heavy chain type (IgG, IgA, IgM) and light chain type (kappa
or lambda).
◦ Consider clinical context and history for accurate
interpretation.
B) Reporting Results:
◦ Record and report results in the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
◦ Provide a detailed interpretation of the findings, including
possible clinical implications.
7. REFERENCE INTERVALS
◦ Normal: No monoclonal bands present; polyclonal bands
may be seen.
◦ Abnormal: Presence of monoclonal protein bands, heavy
and/or light chains, consistent with monoclonal
gammopathies.
8. QUALITY ASSURANCE
◦ Follow standard operating procedures for quality control and
assurance.
◦ Perform routine maintenance and calibration of
electrophoresis equipment.
◦ Document all procedures, control results, and any corrective
actions taken.
9. LIMITATIONS
◦ Hematuria or other significant contaminants may interfere
with the results.
◦ Dilution factors need to be optimized for each urine sample
to avoid false negatives.
