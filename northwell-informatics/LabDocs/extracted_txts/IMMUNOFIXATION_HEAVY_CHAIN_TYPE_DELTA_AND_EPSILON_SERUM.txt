Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for IMMUNOFIXATION
HEAVY CHAIN TYPE DELTA AND EPSILON, SERUM
1. PURPOSE To ensure accurate and consistent results in the
analysis of serum for the presence and identification of heavy chain
types delta (δ) and epsilon (ε) through immunofixation
electrophoresis.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
• Laboratory technologists are responsible for performing the
analysis and documenting results.
• Supervisors are responsible for reviewing the results, maintaining
quality control, and ensuring SOP adherence.
3. EQUIPMENT & SUPPLIES
• Immunofixation electrophoresis (IFE) system
• Gel electrophoresis unit
• Power supply
• Serum protein electrophoresis (SPE) gel
• Specific antisera for heavy chains delta (δ) and epsilon (ε)
• Staining and destaining solutions
• Applicator strips
• Gel drying system
• Heating block
• Quality control serum
4. SPECIMEN
• Preferred specimen: Serum collected in a serum separator tube
(SST).
• Stability: Serum samples should be kept at 4-8°C and tested
within 72 hours. If storage is longer, freeze at -20°C.
5. PROCEDURE
5.1. Preparation of Reagents and Equipment
• Bring all reagents to room temperature before use.
• Prepare the gel electrophoresis unit and set the temperature
control according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
• Check antisera expiration dates and ensure they are not expired.
5.2. Sample Preparation
• Allow serum sample to reach room temperature.
• If necessary, centrifuge the specimen at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes
to clarify the serum.
• Allocate the required volume of serum according to the IFE kit
instructions.
5.3. Gel Electrophoresis
• Apply serum samples to the SPE gel using applicator strips.
• Place the gel in the electrophoresis chamber.
• Run electrophoresis under the specified conditions (e.g., 100V for
60 minutes).
5.4. Immunofixation
• After electrophoresis, overlay the gel with antisera specific for
heavy chains δ and ε on designated areas.
• Incubate the gel at room temperature for the manufacturer’s
recommended time period (typically 30-60 minutes).
5.5. Washing and Staining
• Carefully remove excess antisera and wash the gel according to
the manufacturer’s instructions.
• Stain the gel in the staining solution for 10 minutes.
• Destain the gel to visualize bands clearly.
5.6. Drying the Gel
• Place the gel in a gel drying system and heat at 60°C until
completely dry.
5.7. Interpretation of Results
• Place the dried gel on a lightbox for better visualization.
• Compare the bands present in the patient's serum with the
corresponding control bands.
• Identify the presence of delta (δ) or epsilon (ε) heavy chains by
the specific bands formed where the sample has reacted with the
corresponding antisera.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run quality control samples with each batch of patient samples.
• Document the results of the quality control serum to ensure the
accuracy and integrity of the test method.
• In the event of any discrepancies or failures in quality control, re-
run the test and/or notify the supervisor for further investigation.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
• Record findings in the LIS (Laboratory Information System).
• Results should indicate if delta (δ) and/or epsilon (ε) chains are
detected.
• Add interpretive comments as needed based on the presence of
specific bands.

• Manufacturer’s manual for the Immunofixation Electrophoresis
System.

(SOP).
9. DOCUMENTATION
• Maintain records of all patient results, quality control results, and
maintenance logs for the electrophoresis equipment.
This SOP ensures consistent and reliable outcomes for the detection
and identification of immunoglobulin heavy chains delta and epsilon
in patient serum samples using immunofixation electrophoresis.
