Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase for Immunofixation with Free Light
Chains, Quantitative, Urine
1. PURPOSE To provide detailed instructions for the quantitative
analysis of free light chains in urine using immunofixation technique.
This procedure ensures accurate and reliable results for clinical
diagnosis and monitoring.
2. PRINCIPLE AND SCOPE Immunofixation (IFE) with quantitative
free light chains assays is performed to evaluate monoclonal proteins
and amyloidosis. It involves the highly specific antigen-antibody
reactions to identify and measure the concentration of free lambda
and kappa light chains in the urine.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Preferred/acceptable:
◦ Clean-catch, midstream urine collected in a sterile container. A
minimum of 10 mL is required.
• Unacceptable:
◦ Specimens with no collection date/time indicated on the
container or requisition.
◦ Specimens arriving in the laboratory more than 24 hours after
collection without proper storage conditions.
◦ Specimens visibly contaminated or in non-standard
containers.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Immunofixation Electrophoresis System
• Anti-Kappa and Anti-Lambda Free Light Chain Reagents
• Buffer solutions for electrophoresis
• Gel matrices
• Standard calibration samples
• Appropriate controls (positive and negative)
5. PREPARATION AND PROCEDURES
• Sample Reception:
◦ Verify specimen integrity and proper labeling.
◦ Record the specimen on the accession sheet.
◦ If specimen has been refrigerated, equilibrate to room
temperature.
• Preparation:
◦ Measure 10 mL of the urine sample and perform a standard
preparation protocol including concentration steps if required.
◦ Load samples along with standards and controls onto the
electrophoresis system.
• Electrophoresis:
◦ Run the gel electrophoresis according to manufacturer’s
protocol.
◦ Apply anti-Kappa and anti-Lambda reagents using specified
procedure in the instrument manual.
6. DATA ACQUISITION
• Gel Imaging and Analysis:
◦ After running electrophoresis, visualize the gels using a gel
imaging system.
◦ Acquire digital images of the gels.
◦ Identify and quantify the bands corresponding to free lambda
and kappa light chains.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Internal Quality Control:
◦ Use positive and negative controls with each batch.
◦ Verify each lot number of reagents with standard samples.
◦ Ensure proper calibration of the imaging system before
acquiring images.
• External Quality Assurance:
◦ Participate in inter-laboratory quality assurance programs to
maintain standard performance metrics.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Interpretation:
◦ Compare sample results against known standards and
controls.
◦ Identify any abnormal findings and interpret in the context of
clinical presentations.
• Documentation:
◦ Verify results against expected ranges and clinical context.
◦ Enter results electronically into the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
◦ Ensure all results are reviewed and finalized by qualified
personnel.
9. REFERENCE INTERVALS AND LIMITATIONS
• Consult the immunofixation kit insert for specific reference values
for free kappa and lambda light chains.
• Understand potential interferences, including renal dysfunction
and dehydration which may affect results.

11. RESPONSIBILITIES
• It is the responsibility of laboratory staff to perform the procedure
accurately and to follow all QC measures.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring comprehensive training
and adherence to SOP.
12. REVIEW AND UPDATES

communicated to all relevant staff members.
This SOP ensures that the analytical phase of generating results for
Immunofixation with Free Light Chains, Quantitative, Urine is carried
out systematically, ensuring reliable and accurate results for clinical
diagnosis.
