Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs): Analytical Phase for
Immunofluorescence (IF) on Tissue Samples
1. PURPOSE
To outline the standardized protocol for performing
immunofluorescence on tissue samples, ensuring accurate and
reproducible results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
All designated laboratory personnel performing and supervising
immunofluorescence assays on tissue samples must adhere to
this procedure. It is also the responsibility of all staff to report
any deviations from the process to their supervisor.
3. DEFINITION
Immunofluorescence is a laboratory technique used to visualize
the presence, abundance, and location of specific antigens in
tissue sections using antibodies conjugated with fluorescent
dyes.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
a. Specimen Type: Fresh-frozen or formalin-fixed, paraffin-
embedded (FFPE) tissue specimens.
b. Specimen Storage:
◦ Fresh-frozen tissues: Store at -80°C.
◦ FFPE tissues: Store at room temperature.
c. Critical Conditions: Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles for
frozen tissues. Ensure FFPE blocks are properly sealed.
5. EQUIPMENT AND MATERIELS
◦ Cryostat or microtome
◦ Slide adhesive
◦ Humidity chamber
◦ PBS (Phosphate Buffered Saline)
◦ Blocking solution
◦ Primary antibodies (store at manufacturer recommended
conditions)
◦ Secondary antibodies (fluorophore-conjugated)
◦ Mounting medium with antifade
◦ Microscope (fluorescence capable)
6. PROCEDURE
A. Slide Preparation
1. For Fresh-Frozen Tissue: a. Cut 4-6µm thick tissue
sections using a cryostat. b. Mount sections on positively
charged slides. c. Allow sections to air dry for 30 minutes.
d. Fix sections in cold acetone for 10 minutes. e. Air dry
for another 10 minutes before storage at -20°C or proceed
immediately.
2. For FFPE Tissue: a. Cut 4-5µm thick sections using a
microtome. b. Mount sections on positively charged
slides. c. Deparaffinize slides by placing them in xylene
and rehydrate through graded alcohols to distilled water.
d. Perform heat-induced epitope retrieval in citrate buffer
pH 6.0 or another suitable buffer as per antibody
requirements.
B. Immunofluorescence Staining
1. Blocking: a. Outline tissue sections with a hydrophobic
barrier pen. b. Place slides in a humidity chamber. c. Add
blocking solution (e.g., 5% serum in PBS) to cover the
sections and incubate for 30 minutes at room
temperature.
2. Primary Antibody Incubation: a. Dilute primary
antibodies in antibody diluent or blocking solution as per
manufacturer instructions. b. Add primary antibody
solution to each section, ensuring complete coverage. c.
Incubate at 4°C overnight or at room temperature for 1-2
hours, depending on antibody specificity.
3. Washing: a. Rinse slides in PBS 3 times for 5 minutes
each to remove unbound primary antibody.
4. Secondary Antibody Incubation: a. Dilute fluorophore-
conjugated secondary antibodies in antibody diluent. b.
Incubate slides with the secondary antibody solution for 1
hour at room temperature in the dark. c. Wash slides with
PBS 3 times for 5 minutes each in the dark.
5. Mounting: a. Remove excess PBS and add a drop of
mounting medium with antifade to each section. b. Cover
with coverslip and seal edges to prevent drying.
7. MICROSCOPY AND IMAGE CAPTURE
a. Carefully observe stained slides under a fluorescence
microscope. b. Capture images using appropriate filter settings
for the fluorophores used. c. Ensure consistency in exposure
settings to maintain comparability.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
a. Include positive and negative control tissue sections in each
staining run. b. Validate each new batch of primary and
secondary antibodies. c. Record observations and note any
deviations or unexpected results.
9. REPORTING OF RESULTS
a. Document findings in the laboratory information system (LIS).
b. Provide detailed observations, including the intensity and
localization of fluorescence. c. Attach images to the report
where applicable.
10. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Reference intervals and expected results will vary depending on the
antigen of interest and must be interpreted in the context of clinical
and pathological findings.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
a. Variations in tissue processing, sectioning, and staining can affect
antigenicity. b. Fluorescence quenching and photobleaching can
compromise the integrity of results. c. Non-specific binding may
occur, necessitating appropriate controls.
