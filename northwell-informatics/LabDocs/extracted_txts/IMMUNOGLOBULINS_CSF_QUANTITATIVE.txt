IMMUNOGLOBULINS, CSF QUANTITATIVE Protocol
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the procedure for the quantitative analysis of
immunoglobulins in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) using a standardized
method to ensure accuracy, precision, and reliability of test results.
The procedure includes measurement for IgG, IgA, and IgM, among
others.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the
analysis and documenting all procedures and results. It is also the
responsibility of the laboratory supervisor to review and validate
results for accuracy.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen Collection:
• Acceptable Specimen: CSF collected in a sterile container.
• Volume Required: Minimum of 1 mL but preferably 2 mL to ensure
sufficient quantity for multiple tests.
• Storage: CSF specimens should be refrigerated at 2-8°C if testing
is to be delayed. Specimens can be stored up to 48 hours at this
temperature.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens with visible contamination.
• Specimens collected in non-sterile containers.
• CSF specimens with insufficient volume for the analysis.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Equipment: Automated immunoassay analyzer (e.g., Siemens BN
ProSpec, Roche Cobas Integra)
• Reagents: Specific reagent kits for immunoglobulin quantification
(e.g., Siemens N Latex IgG, IgA, and IgM kits)
• Supplies: Pipettes, sample cups, calibration standards, quality
control material, tubes.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation:
1. Verify specimen identification and integrity.
2. Allow refrigerated CSF specimens to equilibrate to room
temperature before analysis.
3. Thoroughly mix the specimen by gently inverting the container.
B. Calibration and Quality Control:
1. Calibrate the immunoassay analyzer using manufacturer-
provided calibration standards.
2. Run quality control samples at the beginning of each batch to
ensure assay accuracy. Use at least two levels of controls (low
and high levels) and record the results.
C. Analytical Phase:
1. Load the CSF specimen into the sample cups and place them
in the designated position on the analyzer.
2. Program the analyzer according to the specific immunoglobulin
assays to be run. Enter the patient identification details.
3. Initiate the run and monitor the analyzer for any errors or alerts
during the process.
4. Upon completion, review the raw output data for each
immunoglobulin and ensure it conforms to acceptable limits.
D. Validation and Reporting:
1. Each result must be validated by comparing quality control
results and ensuring they fall within acceptable ranges.
2. Any questionable or outlier results must be rerun or further
investigated before reporting.
3. Documentation of each step, including specimen handling,
calibration, QC checks, and analytical data must be maintained
in a log.
4. REPORTING RESULTS
Results should be reviewed and verified by the technologist before
being entered into the Laboratory Information System (LIS). Reported
results must include:
• The concentration of each immunoglobulin (IgG, IgA, IgM) in mg/
dL.
• Any relevant comments regarding the analysis, such as ‘Sample
integrity issue’, or ‘Reanalysis required due to initial QC failure’.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
Material: - Kenlor Industries – 2 Levels: 3 x 10mL Negative QC and
Positive QC - Biorad Liquichek Immunoassay (Bilevel) Ref # 435
Storage: - 2-8°C. Stable unopened until the expiry date.
Procedure: - Each new reagent lot received will require calibration
and QC validation before use in patient sample analysis.
Monthly evaluation: - Perform a monthly inter-lab comparison for the
Immunoglobulins assay and review the instrument printouts for
consistency.
