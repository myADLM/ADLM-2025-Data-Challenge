1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedure for the analytical
phase of generating results for Immunoglobulins (IgG, IgA, and IgM)
in serum to ensure consistent, reliable and accurate laboratory
analyses.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of designated laboratory personnel to perform
immunoglobulin testing following this protocol. Supervisors are
responsible for ensuring all staff are trained and compliant with these
procedures.
1. DEFINITION
IMMUNOGLOBULINS: Immunoglobulins (Ig) are antibodies, a critical
part of the immune response, with specific testing for IgG, IgA, and
IgM performed to diagnose and monitor immune system health or
disorders.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Immunoturbidimetric assay kit for IgG, IgA, and IgM
• Calibrators and controls (appropriate for the specific assay)
• Automated immunoassay analyzer
• Quality control materials
• Micropipettes and tips
• Serum samples
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen:
• Fresh serum collected in a serum separator tube (SST).
Stability:
• Serum samples are stable for up to 7 days at 2-8 °C.
• For long-term storage, aliquot and freeze specimens at -20 °C or
lower.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens that are hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric.
• Specimens collected in anticoagulant vacutainers.
1. PROCEDURE
5.1 Preparation and Calibration
1. Turn on the immunoassay analyzer and perform initial system
checks as per the manufacturer’s guidelines.
2. Prepare the analyzer by loading the reagent kits and
calibrators.
3. Perform calibration of the assay using the provided calibrators
according to the manufacturer's instructions. Ensure calibration
results fall within acceptable ranges before proceeding.
5.2 Running Controls
1. Run quality controls (QCs) at different levels (e.g., normal and
pathological) using control materials.
2. Verify that QC results are within the acceptable range as per
the manufacturers’ guidelines. If not, troubleshoot according to
the analyzer’s manual or seek supervisor assistance before
running patient samples.
5.3 Sample Analysis
1. Allow all reagents and samples to reach room temperature
before use.
2. Gently mix serum specimens by inversion; do not vortex.
3. Label and load patient samples into the designated rack on the
analyzer.
4. Input the required sample IDs, including necessary patient
information and tests to be performed, into the analyzer’s
software.
5. Start the assay run as instructed by the immunoassay
analyzer’s operational manual.
6. Assay for each immunoglobulin (IgG, IgA, and IgM) individually
or in a panel, as required.
5.4 Monitoring and Documentation
1. Monitor the analyzer during the run to ensure no errors or
deviations occur.
2. Once the run is complete, review the results to ensure they
meet predefined quality standards.
3. Transfer validated results to the Laboratory Information System
(LIS) for recording and further processing.
4. REPORTING RESULTS
5. Verify the generated immunoglobulin results against the
reference intervals.
6. Report any critical values according to the laboratory’s standard
critical value reporting procedure.
7. Ensure all results are reviewed and authorized by a designated
supervisor or senior technologist.
Reference Intervals:
IgG: 700 - 1600 mg/dL IgA: 70 - 400 mg/dL IgM: 40 - 230 mg/dL
1. QUALITY CONTROL
2. Perform QC at the beginning of each day and whenever a new
reagents lot is used.
3. Document all QC results in the quality control log. Investigate
and resolve any QC failures before continuing patient testing.
4. The analyzer should be subjected to periodic maintenance as
recommended by the manufacturer.
5. TROUBLESHOOTING
6. Instrument errors or deviances in assay performance should be
troubleshooted according to the manufacturer’s manual.
7. If recalibration or maintenance does not resolve the issue,
consult the technical support team for the analyzer.
8. Document all troubleshooting activities in the instrument’s
maintenance log.

immunoassay analyzer.
12. Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)
guidelines.

handling.
14. REVIEW AND APPROVAL
This protocol is to be reviewed annually or whenever there is a
change in the assay procedure, instrument, or regulations. All
changes must be approved by the laboratory director or a designated
senior laboratory supervisor.
Implementing this SOP ensures that the process of generating
immunoglobulin (IgG, IgA, IgM) serum results is consistent, accurate,
and compliant with regulatory standards.
