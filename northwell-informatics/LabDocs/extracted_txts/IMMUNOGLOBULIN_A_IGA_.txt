Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Immunoglobulin A (IgA)
1. PURPOSE: To outline the procedures for the accurate and
precise measurement of Immunoglobulin A (IgA) in human
serum or plasma. This protocol will ensure consistent and
reliable results, meeting the standards required for clinical
diagnosis.
2. SCOPE: This procedure applies to all laboratory personnel
responsible for IgA testing within the clinical laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY: It is the responsibility of the designated
laboratory staff to perform and document the IgA testing
according to this SOP. All personnel must ensure the accuracy
of test results and identify any deficiencies.
4. SPECIMEN: Preferred/acceptable:
• Serum or Plasma: 5 ml of blood collected in a serum separator
tube (SST) or a lithium heparin plasma tube.
• Specimens should be centrifuged within 2 hours of collection.
• Serum/plasma should be stored at 2-8°C if tested within 48 hours
or frozen at -20°C for longer storage.
Unacceptable:
• Hemolyzed samples.
• Samples with improper labeling.
• Samples with visible particulate matter after centrifugation.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES:
• Immunoglobulin A (IgA) Assay Kit (refer to manufacturer’s
instructions for specific reagents).
• Calibrators and controls (low, normal, and high).
• Micropipettes and tips.
• Laboratory glassware.
• Centrifuge.
• Plate reader or other appropriate analytical instrumentation as
specified by the assay kit.
• Personal protective equipment (PPE).
1. PROCEDURE: A) Calibration:
• Ensure that all reagents and samples are at room temperature
(18-25°C) before starting the assay.
• Calibrate the assay system using the provided calibrators to
establish a standard curve.
• Follow the manufacturer's instructions for preparing and running
calibrators.
B) Assay Procedure:
1. Obtain the IgA assay kit reagents and ensure they have not
expired.
2. Prepare the reagent, calibrator, and control solutions as per the
manufacturer's instructions.
3. Pipette a specified volume of the calibrator, control, and patient
samples into the appropriate wells of the assay plate or tube.
4. Add the specified amount of IgA reagent to each well.
5. Incubate the plate/tube for the time and at the temperature
specified in the kit's instructions.
6. Wash the wells multiple times as per instructions to remove any
unbound substances.
7. Add the appropriate substrate solution and incubate for the
specified time.
8. Stop the reaction by adding the stop solution.
9. Measure absorbance at the specified wavelength using a plate
reader or other analytical device.
C) Interpretation of Results:
• Generate a standard curve by plotting the known concentrations
of the calibrators against their absorbance values.
• Determine the IgA concentrations in the patient samples by
comparing their absorbance values to the standard curve.
• Ensure that all controls fall within the established ranges. If any
controls fall outside of acceptable limits, re-run the assay after
troubleshooting.
1. QUALITY CONTROL:
• Run low, normal, and high controls with each batch of samples.
• Document all control results and ensure they fall within the
specified ranges.
• If controls are out of range, investigate the potential causes, take
appropriate corrective actions, and re-run affected samples.
• Ensure instrument maintenance and calibration are performed as
scheduled and documented.
1. REPORTING RESULTS:
• Transmit results to the Laboratory Information System (LIS) after
verifying the accuracy of the data.
• Review and sign off on the results as per laboratory policies.
• Critical results must be communicated immediately to the
requesting clinician.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS: Immunoglobulin A (IgA) reference
intervals may vary based on age and gender. Ensure the
reference intervals used are appropriate for the population
being tested and listed in the laboratory’s reference interval
database.
2. METHOD LIMITATIONS: Refer to the assay kit insert for any
specific limitations related to the reagent pads or the procedure.
3. REFERENCES:
