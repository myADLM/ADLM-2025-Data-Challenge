Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Immunoglobulin A (IgA) Heavy and Light
Chain (HLC) Pairs, Kappa and Lambda with Ratio
1. PURPOSE
This protocol defines the procedures for the analysis and generation
of results for Immunoglobulin A (IgA) heavy and light chain (HLC)
pairs, including kappa and lambda light chains, and their respective
ratios, in order to ensure accuracy, consistency, and traceability of
results within a CLIA-certified laboratory.
Responsibility:
• It is the responsibility of designated laboratory staff to perform this
analysis adhering to these procedures.
• It is the responsibility of the supervisor to ensure compliance and
to address any issues arising during the analytical phase.
1. DEFINITIONS
• IgA HLC Pairs: Immunoglobulin A heavy and light chain pairs.
• Kappa and Lambda Light Chains: Light chains associated with
immunoglobulin molecules, important for diagnosing and
monitoring certain plasma cell disorders.
• HLC Ratio: The ratio of kappa to lambda light chains for IgA.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Serum
• Volume: A minimum of 1.0 mL of serum is required.
• Storage: Specimens should be stored at 2-8°C and analyzed
within 7 days. For longer storage, freeze at -20°C or lower.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Immunoassay Analyzer: An instrument validated for measuring
immunoglobulin heavy and light chains.
• Reagents: Manufacturer-specific kits for measuring IgA HLC,
kappa, and lambda.
• Calibrators: Validated calibrators provided in the assay kit.
• Quality Control Materials: Commercially available control sera
with known concentrations.
1. PROCEDURE
Step-by-Step Instructions:
A) Preparation:
1. Bring all reagents, calibrators and controls to room temperature
before starting the assay.
2. Verify that all reagents are within their expiration date.
B) Calibration:
1. Load the calibrators on the immunoassay analyzer.
2. Perform calibration according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Ensure appropriate calibration curve validity before
proceeding.
3. Document the calibration.
C) Quality Control:
1. Run low, medium, and high-level controls.
2. Verify that control results fall within the designated range.
3. Document and review QC results. Troubleshoot any QC failures
before proceeding with the analysis of patient samples.
D) Sample Analysis:
1. Thaw patient specimens (if frozen) and bring them to room
temperature. Gently mix all specimens prior to analysis.
2. Load patient specimens onto the immunoassay analyzer.
3. Ensure correct placement and identification of specimens in the
analyzer.
4. Start the assay run according to the analyzer’s instructions.
5. The analyzer will automatically measure the concentrations of
IgA kappa and lambda HLC pairs, and calculate the HLC ratio.
E) Result Generation:
1. Review the results generated by the analyzer.
2. Check for any automated flags or error messages and address
them according to manufacturer guidelines.
3. Validate results for medical relevance and consistency with QC
data.
4. REPORTING RESULTS
• Result Documentation: Results should be automatically
transmitted to the LIS for further review and electronic storage.
• Review and Verification: Technologists must review and verify
results in the LIS, ensuring data accuracy and integrity.
• Critical Values: Any critical or unexpected results must be
brought to the immediate attention of the responsible healthcare
provider.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Frequency: Perform QC checks at the beginning of each shift,
after instrument maintenance, or when deemed necessary by
significant changes in ambient conditions.
• QC Materials: Run commercially available control sera and
document results.
• Troubleshooting: If QC results fall outside the acceptable range,
perform appropriate troubleshooting, document actions taken, and
rerun controls before analyzing patient specimens.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• IgA Kappa: Refer to assay kit insert for specific reference ranges.
• IgA Lambda: Refer to assay kit insert for specific reference
ranges.
• IgA Kappa/Lambda Ratio: Refer to assay kit insert for specific
reference ranges.
1. LIMITATIONS
• Hemolysis, lipemia, and icterus may interfere with results.
• Abnormal protein levels due to paraproteinemia can affect test
outcomes.
