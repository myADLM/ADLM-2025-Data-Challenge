STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP) FOR ANALYTICAL
TESTING OF IMMUNOGLOBULIN A (IGA), SERUM
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the procedures for analyzing Immunoglobulin A
(IgA) levels in serum samples. Accurate testing and reporting are
essential for diagnostic purposes and monitoring of disease states.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
Laboratory staff responsible for performing IgA serum analyses must
adhere to this protocol. It is the responsibility of laboratory
management to ensure all staff are adequately trained.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type:
• Serum
Volume:
• Minimum of 0.5 mL serum
Collection and Handling:
• Collect blood using standard venipuncture techniques into a
serum separator tube (SST).
• Allow the blood to clot at room temperature (15-30 minutes).
• Centrifuge at 1500-2000 x g for 10 minutes to obtain serum.
• Transfer serum to a labeled snap-cap tube if not tested
immediately.
• Store serum at 2-8°C for up to 7 days. For longer storage,
samples can be frozen at -20 to -80°C.
4. REAGENTS, SUPPLIES, AND EQUIPMENT
Reagents:
• IgA reagent kit
• Calibrators (provided in the kit)
• Quality control sera (low, normal, and high IgA levels)
Supplies:
• Micropipettes and tips
• Microcentrifuge tubes
• Laboratory labels
Equipment:
• Immunoassay analyzer
• Centrifuge
• Refrigerator and freezer for storage
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
5. PROCEDURE
A. Calibration:
1. Prepare calibrators according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
2. Load calibrators onto the immunoassay analyzer.
3. Perform calibration runs as per instrument-specific instructions.
4. Verify calibration curves as per laboratory policy.
B. Quality Control:
1. Thaw quality control sera, if frozen, and bring to room
temperature.
2. Vortex gently to mix.
3. Load quality control samples onto the immunoassay analyzer.
4. Run controls at the beginning of each testing batch and after
any major maintenance or calibration.
5. Ensure QC results fall within the acceptable range. If controls
fail, troubleshoot according to manufacturer's guidelines and
document corrective actions.
C. Sample Analysis:
1. Bring serum samples to room temperature if previously
refrigerated or frozen. Gently mix.
2. Load samples onto the immunoassay analyzer.
3. Input sample identification and necessary test parameters.
4. Initiate the IgA immunoassay run following the analyzer’s
operation manual.
5. Monitor the assay for any errors or interruptions.
6. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
1. Upon completion of the run, verify that all required QC criteria
are met.
2. Review the results for all patient samples. If any results fall
outside of the reportable range or show flags, repeat analysis or
investigate further as necessary.
3. Results are reported in the concentration of IgA (mg/dL).
7. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Transmit the results to the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
2. Ensure that each result is reviewed and verified by a licensed
technologist or pathologist.
3. Critical values must be communicated to the requesting
healthcare provider immediately, with documentation of the
notification.
8. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Reference intervals for serum IgA concentrations should be
defined according to the manufacturer’s recommendations or
based on your laboratory’s established reference range. Typically,
reference ranges can be around:
◦ Adults: 70-400 mg/dL
◦ Children and neonates: Refer to specific age-related normal
values.
9. QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE
• Perform regular maintenance on the immunoassay analyzer as
per the manufacturer’s schedule.
• Participate in external quality assessment (EQA) or proficiency
testing programs.
• Document all QC activities, calibration, and any troubleshooting
activities.
10. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolysis, lipemia, or icteric serum may interfere with the assay.
Visually inspect samples for signs of interference and note any
potential issues.
• High-dose hook effect might occur at very high IgA
concentrations. Dilute samples if necessary and reanalyze.
11. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions for the IgA reagent kit and
immunoassay analyzer.
• Laboratory procedure manual for immunoassays.
• Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines.
12. RECORDS AND DOCUMENTATION
• Maintain records of all calibrations, QC runs, and sample
analyses.
• Archive patient results in the LIS and ensure compliance with data
retention policies.
13. SAFETY AND WASTE DISPOSAL
• Follow the laboratory’s safety protocols and wear appropriate
PPE.
• Dispose of biological and chemical waste according to local
regulations and laboratory policies.
Draft Approval:
• Review the draft with the laboratory director and technical
supervisors for approval prior to implementation.
