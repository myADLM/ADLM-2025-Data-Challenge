Standard Operating Procedure for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Immunoglobulin D (IgD), Serum
1. Purpose
To outline the procedure for the accurate and consistent
analysis of Immunoglobulin D (IgD) in serum samples to ensure
valid and reproducible results.
2. Scope
This procedure is applicable to all clinical laboratory personnel
involved in handling, processing, and analyzing serum samples
for IgD determination.
3. Responsibility
It is the responsibility of all trained personnel to comply with this
procedure to ensure proper analysis of IgD. Supervisors must
ensure that all staff are adequately trained and that the
procedure is continually adhered to and updated as necessary.
4. Principle
The quantitative determination of Immunoglobulin D (IgD) in
human serum is performed using nephelometric or
immunoassay techniques. These methods are based on the
antigen-antibody reaction, where IgD in the serum specifically
binds to anti-IgD antibodies forming immune complexes that
can be measured.
5. Specimen Requirements
a. Preferred specimen: Fresh human serum. b. Collection:
Blood should be collected in a red-top or serum separator tube
(without anticoagulant). c. Handling:
◦ Allow the blood to clot at room temperature for 30 minutes.
◦ Centrifuge the blood specimen at 1500x g for 10-15
minutes.
◦ Transfer the serum into a clean, labeled secondary tube. d.
Storage:
◦ Store serum samples at 2-8°C if analysis will be conducted
within 48 hours.
◦ For longer storage, freeze the serum at -20°C or colder.
Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
6. Unacceptable Specimens
◦ Hemolyzed samples.
◦ Specimens that are turbid or contain particulate matter.
◦ Serum samples not collected or stored within the specified
conditions.
7. Reagents and Supplies
◦ Anti-IgD reagent or antibodies.
◦ Calibrators and controls for IgD.
◦ Reaction buffer.
◦ Dilution buffer.
◦ Microplates or cuvettes.
◦ Pipettes and tips.
◦ Laboratory-grade water.
8. Equipment
◦ Immunoassay analyzer or nephelometer.
◦ Refrigerated centrifuge.
◦ Vortex mixer.
◦ Specimen tubes and racks.
◦ Timer.
9. Procedure
a. Preparation:
◦ Power on the analyzer and allow it to perform its self-check.
◦ Ensure all reagents and controls are at room temperature.
◦ Calibrate the instrument using the manufacturer's
recommended calibration standards.
◦ Prepare the quality control materials as per the
manufacturer's instructions.
b. Sample Analysis: i. DILUTION: - If necessary, dilute the
serum sample with the dilution buffer as per the instrument’s
protocol. ii. LOADING: - Load the serum, calibrators, and
control samples into appropriate positions in the analyzer. -
Ensure the samples are properly labeled and matched with the
correct test requests. iii. RUN TEST: - Select the test method
for IgD on the analyzer. - Start the analysis run as per the
instrument’s instruction manual.
10. Quality Control
• Run controls at both high and low levels with each batch of
samples.
• Verify that control results are within the expected ranges before
proceeding with patient samples.
• Document all control results in the QC log.
1. Reporting Results
• Review all test results for consistency and validity.
• Compare patient results against reference intervals (typically
0.04-0.4 mg/dL, but varies by lab).
• Report results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS) after
verification.
1. Reference Intervals
• Normal range: 0.04-0.4 mg/dL (may vary slightly depending on
the population served).
1. Method Limitations
• Hemolysis, lipemia, and icterus may interfere with the assay.
• Proper specimen handling and storage are crucial for accurate
results.
• Calibration and control reagents must be checked for expiration
and appropriate storage.
1. Troubleshooting
• If control values fall outside the acceptable range, check for
calibration issues, reagent integrity, or instrument malfunction.
• Re-run controls and samples if necessary.
• Consult with the technical supervisor for unresolved issues.
