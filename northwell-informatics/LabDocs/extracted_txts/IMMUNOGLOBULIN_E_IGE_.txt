Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
IMMUNOGLOBULIN E (IGE) ANALYSIS
1. PURPOSE This document outlines the procedure for the
quantitative determination of Immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels in
serum or plasma using an automated immunoassay analyzer. It
ensures reliable test results and appropriate corrective actions
when necessary.
2. SCOPE This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel involved in
performing IgE testing with the designated automated analyzer
as part of clinical diagnostic services.
3. RESPONSIBILITY Designated laboratory personnel are
responsible for performing the IgE analysis, recording results,
and taking appropriate corrective actions as outlined in this
procedure.
4. DEFINITION Immunoglobulin E (IgE) is an antibody involved in
allergic reactions and immune responses. Its measurement is
essential for diagnosing and monitoring allergic conditions and
certain immune disorders.
5. EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS
• Automated immunoassay analyzer specific for IgE testing
• Calibrators and Quality Control (QC) materials
• Reagents and consumables specific to the analyzer
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
• Pipettes and pipette tips
• Specimen containers (e.g., serum or plasma tubes)
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS Preferred specimens: Serum or
plasma collected in EDTA or heparinized tubes. Unacceptable
specimens: Hemolyzed, lipemic, or severely icteric samples.
Specimen stability:
• Room temperature: Maximum 8 hours
• Refrigerated (2-8°C): Up to 48 hours
• Frozen (-20°C): Up to 1 month
Before analysis:
• Ensure specimens are free of clots and particulate matter.
• Centrifuge specimens at 1,500-2,000 g for 10 minutes if
necessary.
1. PROCEDURE
A) Instrument Calibration
1. Follow the manufacturer's instructions to perform calibration
using the supplied calibrators.
2. Document calibration details, including date, time, calibrator lot
numbers, and results.
3. Ensure calibration results fall within acceptable ranges before
analyzing patient specimens.
B) Quality Control
1. Perform QC testing using at least two levels of QC material
(e.g., low and high levels) at the start of each analytical run.
2. Document QC results, including date, time, QC lot numbers,
and values obtained.
3. Verify that QC results are within the acceptable range.
Investigate and resolve any QC failures before proceeding with
patient specimen testing.
C) Sample Preparation
1. Verify specimen identity and label, matching it with the test
requisition.
2. Prepare aliquots as needed while avoiding contamination.
3. Load specimens onto the analyzer according to the instrument's
instructions.
D) Automated IgE Analysis
1. Set up the analyzer according to the manufacturer’s protocols
for IgE testing.
2. Initiate the analysis and monitor the run continuously.
3. The analyzer will process each specimen and provide
quantitative IgE level results.
4. REPORTING RESULTS
5. Review the analyzer-generated results for each specimen.
6. Verify results, ensure they fall within reportable ranges, and
check for any flags or error messages.
7. Document the results in the laboratory information system
(LIS).
8. Any critical IgE level results should be communicated to the
ordering health provider per site-specific guidelines.
9. QUALITY CONTROL AND MAINTENANCE
10. Perform and document routine instrument maintenance as per
the manufacturer's guidelines.
11. Clean and inspect the analyzer regularly.
12. Schedule and perform preventive maintenance and service
checks with the manufacturer or authorized service agents.
13. TROUBLESHOOTING
14. If the analyzer flags an error or produces out-of-range results,
consult the analyzer’s troubleshooting guide.
15. Re-run the affected specimen after performing corrective
actions.
16. If the issue persists, contact technical support and document
the incident and corrective steps taken.

1. REVISION HISTORY
• Document control information listing creation and revision dates,
as well as approvals by laboratory management.
By following this SOP, laboratory personnel will ensure consistent,
accurate, and reliable determination of IgE levels in patient
specimens, facilitating proper diagnosis and treatment management.
