IMMUNOGLOBULIN E (IGE), SERUM SOP
1. PURPOSE
To ensure the accurate and reliable measurement of Immunoglobulin
E (IgE) in serum using specific immunoassay techniques, facilitating
effective diagnosis and monitoring of allergic conditions and other
related diseases.
Responsibility: Designated staff are responsible for performing the
assay, documenting results, and ensuring that all quality control
procedures are followed.
1. DEFINITION
IgE is an antibody that plays a crucial role in the body's immune
response, particularly in allergic reactions. Serum IgE measurements
can assist in diagnosing allergic diseases and monitoring
immunotherapy effectiveness.
1. PROCEDURE
Specimen Requirements: - Type of Specimen: Serum - Collection:
Obtain blood via venipuncture using standard procedures. Allow the
blood to clot at room temperature for at least 30 minutes. - Centrifuge
and separate serum from cells within 2 hours of collection. - Minimum
Sample Volume: 0.5 mL of serum. - Storage: Serum specimens can
be stored at 2-8°C for up to 7 days or frozen at -20°C or below for
longer storage.
Unacceptable Specimens: - Specimens that are hemolyzed, lipemic,
or icteric. - Specimens in which the serum has been separated from
the cells for more than 2 hours at room temperature or not properly
stored.
Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies: - Immunoassay analyzer - IgE
assay kits - Calibrators and controls specific to the immunoassay
instrument - Pipettes, test tubes, and other standard laboratory
supplies - Refrigerator and freezer for specimen storage
Procedure: 1. Ensure the immunoassay analyzer is calibrated and
quality control checks have been performed in accordance with
manufacturer guidelines. 2. Thaw serum specimens if previously
frozen and allow them to come to room temperature. 3. Prepare
reagents, calibrators, and controls as per manufacturer's instructions.
4. Load specimens, calibrators, and controls into the immunoassay
analyzer. 5. Follow the assay protocol provided by the manufacturer
to run the samples. 6. Document the assay start time, end time, and
any anomalies observed during the run.
Quality Control: - Internal QC: Run at least two levels of quality
control material (low and high) with each assay batch. - External QC:
Participate in external proficiency testing as scheduled by the
laboratory's External Quality Assessment (EQA) program. -
Document all QC results and take appropriate corrective actions if
QC results fall outside of acceptable ranges.
Reporting Results: - Review and verify results from the immunoassay
analyzer. - Ensure all results meet the internal QC acceptance criteria
before reporting. - Report results to the Laboratory Information
System (LIS). - Flag and document any results that fall outside
reference intervals as per laboratory policy and follow up with
physician notification as required for critical values.
Reference Intervals: - Refer to specific kit inserts or established
laboratory reference ranges for IgE in serum. Generally, the
reference range is < 100 IU/mL.
Method Limitations: - Refer to the assay kit insert for details
regarding specific limitations, including interfering substances and
potential cross-reactivity.
Documentation and Record Keeping: - Maintain detailed logs of
calibration data, quality control results, and assay runs. - Ensure all
patient results are documented accurately and promptly. - Store
records in accordance with laboratory’s archiving and retrieval policy.
References: - Manufacturer’s assay kit insert for detailed procedural
guidelines. - Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI)
documentation. - Laboratory’s internal quality control and standard
operating procedures manual.
