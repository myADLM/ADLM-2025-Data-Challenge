Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for IMMUNOGLOBULIN FREE
LIGHT CHAINS, SERUM
1. PURPOSE The analysis of Immunoglobulin Free Light Chains
(FLC) in serum is performed to aid in the diagnosis and
monitoring of plasma cell disorders, such as multiple myeloma
and AL amyloidosis. This protocol ensures standardized and
accurate testing.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory staff are responsible for
performing the analysis, documenting results, and ensuring
adherence to quality control measures. Supervisors are responsible
for reviewing and verifying results, handling deviations, and
implementing corrective actions when necessary.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS Acceptable Specimen:
• Serum specimen collected in a red-top tube or SST (serum
separator tube).
Handling and Stability:
• Serum should be separated from cells within 2 hours of collection.
• If testing is not immediate, serum samples should be stored at
2-8°C and analyzed within 48 hours. For long-term storage,
freeze at -20°C or lower.
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Specimens with significant hemolysis or lipemia.
• Specimens that have been stored outside of acceptable
temperature ranges.
• Specimens without proper labeling or requisition details.
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Immunoglobulin Free Light Chain reagents and controls.
• Immunoassay analyzer capable of measuring Immunoglobulin
Free Light Chains.
• Calibrators specific to the immunoassay.
• Temperature-controlled storage for reagents and samples.
• Personal protective equipment (PPE) for laboratory staff.
1. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
• Ensure that the immunoassay analyzer is calibrated and quality
control (QC) checks are performed according to manufacturer
guidelines.
• Verify that reagents, controls, and calibrators are within their
expiration dates and stored correctly.
• Bring serum samples to room temperature prior to analysis.
Testing:
1. Prepare the analyzer as per the manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Load the serum specimen onto the analyzer.
3. Select the appropriate assay for Immunoglobulin Free Light
Chains.
4. Initiate the assay and allow the analyzer to process the
specimen. The analyzer will measure both κ (kappa) and λ
(lambda) free light chains.
5. Document the results directly from the analyzer printout.
Troubleshooting:
• If the analysis is interrupted, follow the manufacturer's
troubleshooting guidelines.
• Repeat analysis if the initial result is flagged by the analyzer or if
QC fails.
Quality Control:
• Run controls at the beginning of each shift, with each new assay
batch, or whenever required by the manufacturer guidelines.
• Document the results of QC materials and track performance
metrics.
• Investigate and resolve any QC failures before proceeding with
patient sample analysis.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Review and verify all test results for accuracy and consistency.
• Report results through the Laboratory Information System (LIS),
ensuring all relevant patient and test information is included.
• Notify the ordering physician promptly in case of critical values
and document this communication.
Reference Intervals:
• κ Free Light Chain: Refer to manufacturer-specific reference
ranges.
• λ Free Light Chain: Refer to manufacturer-specific reference
ranges.
Method Limitations: Refer to manufacturer’s guidelines for specific
assay limitations. Results may be affected by improper specimen
handling, extreme temperatures, or interfering substances within the
serum.
1. DOCUMENTATION
• Record all procedural steps, QC data, and results in the
laboratory’s documentation system.
• Maintain records for calibration, maintenance, and
troubleshooting of the immunoassay analyzer.
• Ensure all documentation adheres to regulatory standards and
laboratory policies.
