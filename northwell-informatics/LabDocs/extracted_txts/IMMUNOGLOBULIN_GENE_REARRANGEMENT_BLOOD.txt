STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP) FOR
IMMUNOGLOBULIN GENE REARRANGEMENT, BLOOD
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to ensure accurate and reproducible
detection of immunoglobulin gene rearrangement in blood samples.
This SOP outlines the steps for performing immunoglobulin gene
rearrangement analysis, including sample preparation, PCR
amplification, gel electrophoresis, and result interpretation.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of designated laboratory personnel to perform
the procedure as outlined, document all necessary information, and
ensure the quality of the results.
3. DEFINITIONS
Immunoglobulin Gene Rearrangement: The process of recombination
of V, D, and J gene segments to provide a diverse repertoire of
antibodies. This rearrangement can be used to identify clonality in
lymphocytes, which is useful in diagnosing disorders such as
lymphomas and leukemia.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Peripheral blood
• Volume: Minimum of 5 mL collected in an EDTA (lavender top)
tube.
• Storage: Store at 2-8°C; avoid freezing. Specimens should be
processed within 24 hours of collection.
5. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• DNA extraction kit (e.g., QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit)
• PCR reagents (e.g., primers specific for IgH, IgK, etc.)
• Thermal cycler
• Agarose gel electrophoresis apparatus
• Ethidium bromide or alternative DNA stain
• UV transilluminator
• Molecular weight ladder
• PCR tubes and pipettes
• Disposable gloves and lab coats
6. PROCEDURE
6.1. DNA Extraction
1. Extract genomic DNA from 200 µL of whole blood using a DNA
extraction kit according to the manufacturer's instructions.
2. Measure DNA concentration using a spectrophotometer and
adjust the DNA concentration to 50 ng/µL with nuclease-free
water.
3. Store the extracted DNA at -20°C until further analysis.
6.2. PCR Amplification
1. Prepare the PCR reaction mix for amplifying the
immunoglobulin gene segments (IgH, Igλ, Igκ):
◦ 10X PCR buffer
◦ MgCl2
◦ dNTP mix
◦ Taq DNA polymerase
◦ Forward and reverse primers (specific for V, D, and J
segments)
◦ Template DNA (50 ng)
◦ Nuclease-free water
2. Cycle conditions:
◦ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 5 minutes
◦ Denaturation: 95°C for 30 seconds
◦ Annealing: 60°C for 30 seconds
◦ Extension: 72°C for 1 minute
◦ Final extension: 72°C for 10 minutes
◦ Number of cycles: 35
6.3. Gel Electrophoresis
1. Prepare a 2% agarose gel with an appropriate DNA stain.
2. Load 10 µL of the PCR product mixed with loading dye along
with a molecular weight ladder into the gel wells.
3. Run the gel at 100 volts for 1 hour (adjust voltage and time as
needed based on band resolution).
4. Visualize bands under UV light using a transilluminator.
6.4. Interpretation of Results
1. Compare the band pattern of each sample with the molecular
weight markers.
2. Evaluate the band patterns for the presence of clonal
rearrangements:
◦ Monoclonal: Single or dominant sharp bands
◦ Polyclonal: Smear or multiple bands
3. Document the interpretation results on the provided data sheet.
6.5. Quality Control
1. Include positive controls (known monoclonal and polyclonal
samples) and a negative control (no template DNA) with each
run.
2. Verify that control results are as expected before reporting
patient results.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Review the electrophoresis gel image and PCR results.
2. Document the findings in the laboratory information system
(LIS).
3. Communicate any critical or unexpected findings to the
supervising pathologist for review.
8. LIMITATIONS
1. Low-quality DNA can lead to false-negative results.
2. The presence of PCR inhibitors can affect the amplification
process.
3. Interpretation of results requires expertise in hematopathology.

10. DOCUMENTATION
All steps, observations, and results must be documented in the
laboratory's record system, including any deviations from the
procedure and troubleshooting steps taken.
This SOP should be reviewed regularly and updated as necessary to
reflect changes in laboratory practices or new evidence in the field.
