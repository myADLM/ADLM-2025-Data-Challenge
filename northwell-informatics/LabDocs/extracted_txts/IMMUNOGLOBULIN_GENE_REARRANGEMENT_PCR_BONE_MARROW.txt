Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Immunoglobulin Gene
Rearrangement, PCR, Bone Marrow
1. PURPOSE: To provide detailed instructions for the analytical
phase of generating results for Immunoglobulin Gene
Rearrangement, PCR on bone marrow samples, ensuring
accuracy and consistency.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for
performing the procedures outlined in this SOP. Supervisors are
responsible for ensuring adherence to the protocol and addressing
any issues or deviations.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND HANDLING:
• Specimen Type:
◦ Bone marrow aspirate or biopsy
• Specimen Volume:
◦ Minimum of 1-2 mL of bone marrow aspirate
• Collection Container:
◦ Collect in an EDTA (lavender top) tube or specialized
collection tube for nucleic acid preservation
◦ Ensure the container is properly labeled with patient
information and collection date/time
• Stability and Transport:
◦ Specimens should be processed within 24 hours of collection
◦ Transport specimens at room temperature
◦ Avoid exposure to extreme temperatures or prolonged
transport times
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS:
• PCR Thermocycler
• Electrophoresis apparatus
• Reagents for DNA extraction (e.g., silica column-based kits)
• PCR master mix components: DNA polymerase, primers specific
for immunoglobulin gene rearrangement, dNTPs, buffer solutions
• Positive and negative controls for quality assurance
1. PROCEDURE:
A. DNA Extraction:
1. Perform DNA extraction from bone marrow samples using a
silica column-based kit as per manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Quantify and assess the quality of the extracted DNA using a
spectrophotometer. Desired concentration is 50-100 ng/µL and
A260/A280 ratio of 1.8-2.0.
B. PCR Amplification:
1. Prepare the PCR master mix in a sterile, nuclease-free
environment:
◦ 25 µL PCR buffer
◦ 2 µL MgCl2
◦ 0.5 µL dNTPs mix
◦ 0.5 µL forward primer
◦ 0.5 µL reverse primer
◦ 0.2 µL DNA polymerase
◦ 50-100 ng of DNA template
◦ Nuclease-free water to a final volume of 50 µL
2. Set up the PCR thermocycler with the following conditions:
◦ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 5 minutes
◦ 35 cycles of:
▪ Denaturation: 95°C for 30 seconds
▪ Annealing: 55°C for 30 seconds
▪ Extension: 72°C for 1 minute
◦ Final extension: 72°C for 5 minutes
3. Include positive and negative controls in each PCR run.
C. PCR Product Analysis:
1. Load PCR products and appropriate molecular weight ladder
into an agarose gel (2%) prepared with ethidium bromide or
SYBR Safe.
2. Run gel electrophoresis at 100 V for 1 hour.
3. Visualize bands using a UV transilluminator and document the
results using a gel documentation system.
4. QUALITY CONTROL:
• Include positive controls (known rearrangement) and negative
controls (no DNA) in every batch.
• Check that control amplifications give expected results. If controls
fail, results for the batch must be considered invalid and the PCR
must be repeated.
• Document all QC procedures in the logbook.
1. INTERPRETATION AND REPORTING:
• Compare the bands from patient samples to the positive control
and molecular weight ladder.
• Confirm the presence or absence of specific immunoglobulin
gene rearrangements.
• Results should be reviewed and verified by a qualified
technologist.
• Report results through the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
with appropriate comments and interpretation.
1. REFERENCES:
• Manufacturer's instructions for DNA extraction kits
• Thermocycler and electrophoresis apparatus user manuals
• Relevant scientific literature on immunoglobulin gene
rearrangement analysis
1. DOCUMENT CONTROL:
• Maintain detailed records for each patient specimen, including
DNA extraction, PCR set-up, gel electrophoresis results, and
quality control data within the laboratory information management
system (LIMS).
• Ensure all logs, including temperature monitoring, maintenance
records of thermocycler and electrophoresis apparatus, and QC
logs, are up-to-date and signed by the responsible personnel.
By adhering to these procedures, the laboratory ensures the accurate
and reliable generation of results for Immunoglobulin Gene
Rearrangement, PCR from bone marrow samples.
