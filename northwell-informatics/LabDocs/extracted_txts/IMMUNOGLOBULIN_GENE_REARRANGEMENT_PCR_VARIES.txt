IMMUNOGLOBULIN GENE REARRANGEMENT, PCR (IGR-PCR)
SOP
1. PURPOSE The purpose of this SOP is to ensure consistent and
accurate analysis, and reporting of Immunoglobulin Gene
Rearrangement by PCR, which contributes to diagnosis and
monitoring of lymphoid malignancies.
2. RESPONSIBILITY Qualified laboratory personnel are
responsible for performing the Immunoglobulin Gene
Rearrangement by PCR following this procedure. All results
must be reviewed and validated by a designated supervisor or
pathologist.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
• Type: Peripheral blood, bone marrow, or tissue biopsy
• Volume: 5-10 mL of blood or bone marrow in EDTA tube, or a
fresh biopsy specimen
• Stability: Store at 2-8°C and process within 48 hours. If
processing delay is expected, specimens should be frozen at
-20°C.
1. REAGENTS, EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
• DNA extraction kit
• PCR reagents
• Forward and reverse primers specific for relevant Immunoglobulin
Gene segments
• Agarose gel electrophoresis system
• UV transilluminator
• Thermal cycler
• Reagents for Gel Documentation
• Molecular weight markers
1. PROCEDURE
A. DNA EXTRACTION
1. Extract genomic DNA from the received specimens using the
DNA extraction kit as per manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Assess the quantity and quality of DNA using
spectrophotometry.
B. PCR SET-UP
1. Prepare the PCR master mix as follows:
◦ X µL of extracted DNA
◦ Y µL of PCR buffer (10x)
◦ Z µL of MgCl2
◦ A µL of dNTPs
◦ B µL of each primer (forward and reverse)
◦ C µL of DNA polymerase
◦ Add sterile water to a final volume of N µL.
2. Aliquot the PCR master mix into PCR tubes.
3. Place tubes into the thermal cycler and run the following
program:
◦ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 5 min
◦ 35 cycles of:
▪ Denaturation: 95°C for 30 sec
▪ Annealing: 60°C for 30 sec
▪ Extension: 72°C for 1 min
◦ Final extension: 72°C for 10 min
◦ Hold: 4°C
C. AGAROSE GEL ELECTROPHORESIS
1. Prepare a 2% agarose gel with an appropriate DNA stain.
2. Load PCR products along with molecular weight markers into
the gel wells.
3. Run electrophoresis at 120V until the dye front reaches two-
thirds of the gel.
4. Visualize the DNA bands using a UV transilluminator.
D. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
1. Compare the PCR product sizes to the molecular weight
markers.
2. Identify presence of expected bands indicating rearranged
Immunoglobulin genes.
3. Record the presence/absence of bands and the size of bands
in base pairs.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
5. Include positive and negative controls with every PCR run.
◦ Positive Control: DNA from a known positive sample.
◦ Negative Control: PCR mixture without template DNA.
6. Ensure that the controls give expected results before
proceeding with the interpretation of patient samples.
7. Document all QC results and any deviations from expected
outcomes.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
9. Transcribe results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
10. Ensure that results are reviewed by a designated supervisor or
pathologist before final validation and release.
11. Final reports should include:
◦ Patient identification.
◦ Sample type.
◦ PCR results with interpretation and clinical correlation.

1. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS
2. Use appropriate PPE (personal protective equipment) at all
times.
3. Follow laboratory biosafety guidelines.
4. Properly dispose of biohazard waste and chemical reagents as
per laboratory protocol.
This SOP is effective from October 2023 and will be reviewed
annually or as needed.
