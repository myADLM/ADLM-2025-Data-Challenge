Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Measurement
of Immunoglobulin G (IgG)
1. PURPOSE
This SOP describes the procedure for the accurate and precise
measurement of Immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels in patient samples.
The measurement of IgG is required for diagnosing and monitoring
various immunodeficiency states, autoimmune diseases, and
evaluating humoral immunity.
Responsibility:
All laboratory personnel performing this procedure must be trained
and deemed competent. It is the responsibility of the technologist to
follow this SOP strictly to ensure accurate and reliable results.
1. SPECIMEN
Specimen Type: • Serum or plasma (EDTA, heparin, or citrate) is
acceptable. • Preferred: Serum
Specimen Collection: • Collect blood samples using standard
venipuncture technique. • Allow the blood to clot at room temperature
and then centrifuge within 1 hour at 1500 x g for 10 minutes to
separate the serum. • If plasma is used, mix gently after collection,
then centrifuge to separate plasma.
Specimen Storage: • Serum or plasma can be stored at 2-8°C for up
to 72 hours. • For long-term storage, aliquot and freeze samples at
-20°C or lower. • Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
Unacceptable Specimens: • Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric
specimens. • Samples that have been at room temperature for more
than 8 hours without separation. • Specimens without proper labeling
or those together with non-laboratory test requests.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment: • Automated Immunoassay Analyzer • Calibrated Pipettes
• Centrifuge • Refrigerator (2-8°C) • Freezer (-20°C or lower) • Vortex
Mixer
Reagents: • IgG Calibrator • Quality Control (QC) materials (2 levels)
• IgG Reagent Kits (specific for the immunoassay analyzer used)
Supplies: • Sample cups/tubes • Gloves, lab coat, and other personal
protective equipment (PPE) • Pipette tips • Biohazard waste container
1. PROCEDURE
2. Preparation: a. Allow reagents, calibrators, and control
materials to reach room temperature. b. Inspect samples for
any visible contamination or bleeding. c. Verify the calibration
status of the analyzer.
3. Calibration: a. Load the IgG calibrator(s) into the analyzer
according to the manufacturer's instructions. b. Initiate the
calibration process and verify that calibration curves meet
acceptance criteria.
4. Quality Control: a. Run high and low IgG quality control
samples with every batch of patient samples. b. Verify that QC
results fall within the predefined acceptable range before
proceeding.
5. Sample Analysis: a. Label sample cups with unique patient
identifiers. b. Pipette the appropriate volume of serum or
plasma into the sample cups. c. Load sample cups into the
analyzer. d. Follow the instrument’s specific operation protocol
to initiate the assay run.
6. Review and Verification: a. Check raw data and ensure that the
instrument flags no errors. b. Verify that the IgG concentration
values for QC samples are within acceptable limits. c.
Investigate any flagged results or QC failures according to the
troubleshooting guidelines.
7. RESULTS REPORTING
8. Review both patient and quality control results for accuracy.
9. Authorize patient reports only if quality control results are within
the acceptable range.
10. Document and save all data, including calibrations, control
runs, and patient results, in the laboratory information system
(LIS).
11. QUALITY CONTROL AND MAINTENANCE
12. Consult with the QC and calibration logs to ensure proper
performance of the analyzer.
13. Perform regular maintenance on the immunoassay analyzer as
specified in the manufacturer’s manuals.
14. Record any maintenance and troubleshooting actions.

1. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS
Adhere to universal precautions when handling all biological
specimens. Dispose of all biohazard materials per laboratory
protocols. Ensure appropriate PPE is worn at all times during the
procedure.
By adhering to this SOP, laboratory personnel will help ensure
accurate and reliable measurement of IgG levels in patient samples,
supporting effective diagnosis and treatment.
