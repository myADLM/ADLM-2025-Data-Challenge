Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) For Analysis of
Immunoglobulin G (IgG) Heavy and Light Chain (HLC) Pairs,
Kappa and Lambda with Ratio
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to provide standardized and consistent
procedures for the analysis of Immunoglobulin G (IgG) heavy and
light chain (HLC) pairs, kappa and lambda with the ratio in serum or
plasma using a validated immunoassay method. The results
generated from this protocol will support the clinical diagnosis and
monitoring of conditions such as monoclonal gammopathy, multiple
myeloma, and related disorders.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all trained laboratory personnel to follow this
SOP. Any deviations from this protocol must be documented and
reported to the supervisor.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
◦ Preferred Sample: Serum or plasma collected in a plain, clot
activator, or lithium heparin tube.
◦ Volume: At least 3 mL of serum or plasma.
◦ Handling: Samples should be centrifuged and aliquoted
promptly. Serum/plasma should be stored at 2-8°C if
analyzing within 48 hours or frozen at -20°C or colder for
longer storage.
◦ Unacceptable Specimens: Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric
samples may interfere with the assay and should be
rejected.
2. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
◦ Immunoassay analyzer (e.g., Siemens BN II, Roche Cobas,
etc.)
◦ IgG HLC kappa and lambda reagent kits
◦ Quality control materials (high and low control)
◦ Calibrators
◦ Pipettes and disposable tips
◦ Sample storage tubes
3. PROCEDURE
A. Preliminary Steps
• Ensure all equipment is functioning correctly and has been
calibrated according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
• Allow all reagents, calibrators, and controls to come to room
temperature before use.
B. Calibration
• Perform calibration using the calibrators provided with the reagent
kits, following the manufacturer's instructions.
• Verify calibration by running controls and ensuring they fall within
acceptable ranges.
C. Sample Preparation
• Thaw frozen samples at room temperature and mix thoroughly by
gentle inversion.
• Centrifuge samples at 1500 x g for 10 minutes to remove any
particulate matter.
• Label and load samples onto the analyzer as per manufacturer's
instructions.
D. Assay Procedure
• Load reagents, controls, and samples onto the analyzer.
• Program the analyzer with necessary parameters, specifying the
assay type for IgG HLC kappa and lambda pairs.
• Start the run and monitor the analyzer for any error messages or
alerts during the processing.
E. Calculation and Reporting
• The analyzer will automatically calculate the IgG kappa and
lambda HLC values and their ratio.
• Review and verify the results against automated quality control
checks.
• Any discrepancies or out-of-specification results should be
reconciled by retesting or other means of validation.
• Results should be reviewed and released in the LIS (Laboratory
Information System).
1. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Run high and low quality control materials at the start of
each assay run and whenever a new reagent lot is
introduced.
◦ Document and review QC results to ensure they fall within
specified acceptable ranges before patient results are
released.
◦ If QC results are out of acceptable range, investigate,
resolve the issue, and re-run affected specimens.
2. REFERENCE INTERVALS
◦ Establishment and validation of reference intervals should
be carried out as per CLSI guidelines or according to
manufacturer instructions.
◦ Typical reference intervals will be provided by the reagent kit
inserts and should be documented.
3. METHOD LIMITATIONS
◦ Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples may yield inaccurate
results.
◦ The assay should be used in conjunction with other clinical
findings and diagnostic tools.
4. DATA ENTRY AND REPORTING
◦ Ensure accurate data entry of patient demographics and
specimen details into the LIS.
◦ Verify and validate results before releasing them to the
clinician.
◦ Report any critical or unexpected results to the requesting
physician immediately.

pairs.
• CLSI Guidelines: EP15-A3 User Verification of Precision and
Estimation of Bias; Approved Guideline – Third Edition.
By adhering to this protocol, laboratory personnel will ensure the
generation of accurate, reliable, and clinically relevant results for IgG
HLC pairs, kappa and lambda with ratio.
