Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Immunoglobulin G (IgG), Serum
1. PURPOSE
To describe the procedures for the analysis, quality control, and
reporting of serum Immunoglobulin G (IgG) results to ensure
accurate and reliable patient test outcomes.
Responsibility:
• It is the responsibility of trained medical laboratory scientists to
follow this SOP.
• Supervisors must ensure adherence to these procedures and
oversee staff training.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen Collection and Handling:
• Preferred specimen: Serum collected in a plain, red-top tube or a
serum gel-separator tube.
• After collection, allow the blood to clot by standing at room
temperature for 30-60 minutes, then centrifuge to separate serum.
• Serum is stable for up to 8 days at 2-8°C and for up to 1 year
when frozen at -20°C or lower.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Grossly hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
• Specimens collected in EDTA, heparin, or other anticoagulants.
• Specimens with insufficient volume for analysis.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Automated Immunoassay Analyzer suitable for the determination
of IgG levels (e.g., Siemens Atellica IM, Roche Cobas e411, etc.)
Reagents:
• IgG reagent kits specific to the analyzer used (stored as per
manufacturer’s instructions).
• Calibrators and controls specific for IgG assays (stored as per
manufacturer’s instructions).
Supplies:
• Calibrated micropipettes and tips.
• Disposable gloves, laboratory coats, and safety glasses.
• Sample cups and tubes.
1. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
• Ensure all reagents, controls, and equipment are within the
expiration dates and properly maintained.
• Set up and calibrate the Immunoassay Analyzer according to the
manufacturer’s protocol.
• Allow serum samples and controls to reach room temperature
before analysis.
Calibration and Quality Control:
• Calibrate the instrument(s) with IgG calibrators as per
manufacturer instructions.
• Run quality control samples (both low and high levels) at the
beginning of each shift, after calibration, and after maintenance is
performed.
• Quality control results must fall within the established acceptable
ranges. If QC fails, investigate and resolve issues before
proceeding with patient samples.
Sample Analysis:
1. Load the patient serum samples, calibrators, and controls into
the designated positions in the analyzer.
2. Enter patient information or scan barcoded samples into the
system.
3. Select the IgG test and initiate the run.
4. The analyzer will automatically aspirate, mix, and process the
samples.
5. Results will be generated and available for review once the run
is complete.
Result Interpretation:
• Refer to the instrument’s reference ranges and flag any values
falling outside these ranges.
• Review QC results to ensure they are within the defined limits
before verifying patient results.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Transfer the validated results from the instrument to the
Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Ensure that patient results are accurately transcribed and include
any necessary interpretation or comments.
• Critical IgG results outside the normal range
(hypergammaglobulinemia or hypogammaglobulinemia) should
be flagged for immediate clinical review and action.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
Internal Quality Control:
• Three levels of control material should be run daily, with results
recorded and assessed against preset acceptable ranges.
• Any QC failures must be documented, investigated, and rectified
before reporting patient results.
External Quality Control:
• Participate in an accredited external proficiency testing program
to ensure accuracy and reliability of IgG testing.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Reference intervals for serum IgG will be as provided by the
reagent manufacturer and validated through internal quality
control data.
• Common reference ranges for IgG in adults may be 700-1600 mg/
dL, but laboratory-specific reference ranges should be used.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolysis, lipemia, and icterus can interfere with the
immunoassay.
• Ensure the integrity of the sample by proper handling and
processing.

• Manufacturer product inserts and operation manuals.
• Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines.
• Current relevant literature and research updates related to IgG
testing.
