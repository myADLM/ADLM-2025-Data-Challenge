STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP)
Title: Immunoglobulin G (IgG) Subtypes Immunofluorescence in
Tissue
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedures for the
performance of IgG subtypes immunofluorescence on tissue sections
in order to ensure consistent, reliable, and accurate detection and
reporting of IgG subtypes.
Responsibility:
• It is the responsibility of laboratory personnel to strictly adhere to
the procedures outlined in this SOP.
• It is the responsibility of the laboratory supervisor to ensure
personnel are trained and competent in these procedures and to
ensure that all equipment is properly maintained and calibrated.
1. SCOPE
This procedure applies to testing that involves the detection of IgG
subtypes (IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4) in tissue sections using
immunofluorescence microscopy.
1. DEFINITIONS
IgG subtypes: Different forms of the immunoglobulin G protein that
play crucial roles in the immune response. Immunofluorescence: A
technique used to visualize specific proteins or antigens in biological
samples using fluorescently labeled antibodies.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND HANDLING
4.1 Specimen Type:
• Fresh or formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue sections.
4.2 Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens that are not stored appropriately.
• Specimens with inadequate tissue fixation and processing.
• Specimens with insufficient tissue quantity.
4.3 Specimen Handling:
• Ensure tissue sections are cut at an appropriate thickness
(usually 3-5 microns), mounted on positively charged slides, and
dried.
• Store prepared slides at room temperature before staining.
1. REAGENTS AND MATERIALS
5.1 Reagents:
• Primary antibodies specific to human IgG subtypes (IgG1, IgG2,
IgG3, and IgG4), conjugated with fluorophores.
• Fluorescence mounting medium.
• PBS (Phosphate Buffered Saline).
• Blocking buffer (e.g., 5% normal serum in PBS).
5.2 Materials:
• Positively charged microscope slides with mounted tissue
sections.
• Humidified chamber.
• Fluorescence microscope with appropriate filter sets.
1. EQUIPMENT
• Microscope slides.
• Micropipettes and tips.
• Humidified chamber.
• Fluorescence microscope.
• Coverslips.
1. PROCEDURE
7.1 Preparation:
• Place the slides with tissue sections in a humidified chamber to
prevent drying during the staining process.
7.2 Blocking:
• Incubate tissue sections with blocking buffer for 30 minutes at
room temperature to reduce non-specific binding.
7.3 Primary Antibody Incubation:
• Dilute primary antibodies specific to IgG subtypes (according to
manufacturer’s instructions).
• Apply diluted primary antibodies to the tissue sections and
incubate for 1 hour at room temperature in a humidified chamber.
7.4 Washing:
• Rinse slides thoroughly with PBS (3 x 5 minutes).
7.5 Detection and Visualization:
• Apply mounting medium to the tissue sections.
• Place a coverslip over the tissue section and carefully press to
remove any air bubbles.
7.6 Microscopy:
• Examine the slides under a fluorescence microscope.
• Using the appropriate filter sets, observe and document the
presence and intensity of staining.
7.7 Interpretation of Results:
• Assess the staining pattern and intensity of each IgG subtype.
• Compare findings to control slides and assess for any specific
localization within the tissue.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Always include a positive and negative control slide with each
batch of testing.
• Ensure that reagents are within their expiration dates and properly
stored.
• Regularly verify the performance of the fluorescence microscope.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If non-specific staining is observed, increase the concentration of
blocking buffer or duration of blocking step.
• If weak staining is observed, verify the concentration and
incubation time of the primary antibody.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Document the staining pattern and intensity for each IgG subtype.
• Include detailed observations regarding the localization and
distribution of staining within the tissue sample.
• Follow site-specific reporting guidelines to record and
communicate results.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s instructions for primary antibodies.
• Standard texts and journals on immunofluorescence techniques.
• Laboratory’s quality control standards and guidelines.
1. SAFETY AND WASTE MANAGEMENT
• Follow laboratory safety protocols for handling biological
specimens and reagents.
• Dispose of all biological wastes and reagents following the safety
regulations and guidelines established by the facility.
Approval and Review: This SOP must be approved by the laboratory
director and reviewed annually or whenever changes in procedures
or regulations occur.
