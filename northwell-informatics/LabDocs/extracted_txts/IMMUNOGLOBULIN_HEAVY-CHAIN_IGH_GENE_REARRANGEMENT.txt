IMMUNOGLOBULIN HEAVY-CHAIN (IGH) GENE
REARRANGEMENT ANALYSIS PROTOCOL
1. PURPOSE
This procedure provides guidance in the analysis of immunoglobulin
heavy-chain (IGH) gene rearrangement for the detection of clonal
populations of B cells. This analysis is crucial in diagnosing and
monitoring certain lymphoproliferative disorders.
Responsibility:
Designated staff members are responsible for performing the IGH
gene rearrangement analysis, monitoring controls, validating results,
and documenting findings as defined in this procedure.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Acceptable sample types: Fresh or frozen peripheral blood, bone
marrow aspirate, lymph node biopsy, or other tissue samples.
• Required volume: Minimum 5-10 mL of blood or 1-2 mL of bone
marrow aspirate.
• Containers: Sterile collection tubes containing EDTA or other
anticoagulants.
• Stability: Samples should be stored at 2-8°C and processed within
24 hours of collection.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• PCR thermocycler
• Gel electrophoresis equipment
• DNA extraction kits
• Primers specific for IGH gene regions
• PCR reagents (Taq polymerase, dNTPs, buffer)
• Calibration materials for equipment
• Control DNA samples
• Documentation logs and forms
1. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation
1. Using a DNA extraction kit, isolate DNA from the collected
specimen following the manufacturer's instructions.
2. Quantify and purity-check the extracted DNA using a
spectrophotometer or fluorometer.
3. Prepare the DNA for PCR by diluting to the desired
concentration as per assay requirements.
B. PCR Amplification
1. Prepare PCR master mix according to the protocol supplied
with the PCR kit.
◦ Include Taq polymerase, dNTPs, primers specific for the
IGH gene, and appropriate buffer in the PCR master mix.
2. Aliquot the master mix into PCR tubes and add sample DNA.
3. Include positive and negative controls to ensure the validity of
the PCR run.
4. Program the thermocycler with the following cycling
parameters: a) Initial denaturation: 95°C for 5 minutes b)
Denaturation: 95°C for 30 seconds c) Annealing: 58°C for 45
seconds d) Extension: 72°C for 1 minute (Repeat steps b-d for
30-35 cycles) e) Final extension: 72°C for 7 minutes f) Hold:
4°C
C. Gel Electrophoresis
1. Prepare 2% agarose gel with an appropriate electrophoresis
buffer.
2. Load PCR product into wells alongside DNA ladder markers.
3. Run electrophoresis at a constant voltage (e.g., 100V) until the
dye front reaches the desired distance.
4. Stain the gel with an appropriate DNA dye, such as ethidium
bromide, and visualize bands under UV light.
D. Interpretation and Documentation
1. Identify bands corresponding to the IGH gene rearrangement
within the expected size range for clonal populations.
2. Compare the sample bands against the positive and negative
controls.
3. Document the presence or absence of clonal bands and any
discrepancies noted during analysis.
4. Verify the results by a secondary designated staff member.
5. Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
ensuring correctness and completeness.
6. Review any critical results and follow internal protocols for
clinical notification and documentation.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
8. Ensure the PCR reaction includes positive and negative
controls for each run.
9. Perform routine calibration of the PCR thermocycler and
electrophoresis equipment as per manufacturer guidelines.
10. Validate each new batch of primers and reagents.
11. Record all quality control checks, calibrations, and validations in
appropriate logs.
12. Troubleshoot any quality control failures and repeat assays if
necessary.
13. REPORTING RESULTS
14. Generate a report based on the documented findings from the
gel analysis.
15. Confirm that the results meet the criteria for clonal IGH gene
rearrangement based on the visualized bands.
16. Ensure results are transmitted to the LIS and review/verify by
the technologist.
17. Critical results must be promptly communicated to the
requesting clinician and properly documented following
laboratory procedures.
