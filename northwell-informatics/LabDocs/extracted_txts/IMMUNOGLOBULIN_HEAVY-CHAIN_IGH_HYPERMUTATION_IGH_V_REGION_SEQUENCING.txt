Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Immunoglobulin Heavy-
Chain (IGH) Hypermutation (IGH V Region) Sequencing
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedures for the analysis
of Immunoglobulin Heavy-Chain (IGH) Hypermutation (IGH V
Region) sequencing, to ensure the generation of accurate, reliable,
and reproducible results.
Responsibility
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing the
analysis according to this SOP. Supervisors are responsible for
ensuring compliance and proper documentation.
1. DEFINITION
IGH Hypermutation Sequencing refers to the sequencing of the
variable region of the IGH gene to determine the somatic
hypermutation status, which can be important for diagnosing and
monitoring certain hematological conditions.
1. PROCEDURE
A) Sample Preparation
1. Obtain genomic DNA from lymphoid tissue, peripheral blood, or
bone marrow as per standard extraction protocols.
2. Quantify DNA using fluorometric or spectrophotometric
methods. Ensure the concentration is suitable for PCR
amplification (typically, 10-50 ng/μl).
3. Dilute DNA samples to the required concentration using
nuclease-free water.
B) Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) Amplification
1. Prepare PCR reaction mix according to the IGHV PCR kit
manufacturer's instructions.
◦ Include primers specific to the V region of the IGH gene.
◦ Check the final volume and components (e.g., buffer,
dNTPs, Taq polymerase).
2. Aliquot the reaction mix into PCR tubes, add DNA samples, and
ensure proper mixing.
3. Run PCR in a calibrated thermocycler. Standard cycling
conditions typically include:
◦ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 2 minutes
◦ Denaturation: 95°C for 30 seconds
◦ Annealing: 55-65°C for 30 seconds (temperature may vary
based on primer set)
◦ Extension: 72°C for 1 minute (adjust according to amplicon
size)
◦ Final extension: 72°C for 5 minutes
◦ Hold at 4°C until retrieval.
4. Check PCR products via agarose gel electrophoresis (1-2%
gel). Load samples along with DNA ladder standards.
5. Visualize the gel under UV light and document the results.
C) Sequencing Preparation
1. Purify PCR products using a commercial purification kit suitable
for sequencing (e.g., silica column, magnetic bead technology),
following the manufacturer's protocol.
2. Quantify purified PCR products and verify quality (e.g., via
electrophoresis or spectrophotometry).
3. Set up sequencing reactions using a suitable IGHV sequencing
kit and loading purified PCR products into designated
sequencing plates.
4. Load plates into a sequencing machine (e.g., Sanger
sequencer) following standard operating procedures for
sequencing initiation and run conditions.
D) Data Analysis
1. Retrieve sequence data from the sequencer according to
standard download protocols.
2. Import sequence data into bioinformatics software (e.g., NCBI
IgBlast, IMGT/V-QUEST) for alignment and hypermutation
analysis.
3. Analyze sequence data manually or via automated software to
identify somatic hypermutations and determine mutation
frequency.
4. Compile results in a detailed report, including:
◦ Sequence alignment
◦ Mutation profile
◦ Interpretation of mutation status
E) Quality Control
1. Include positive and negative controls in PCR and sequencing
runs.
2. Ensure all equipment used (thermocyclers, sequencers) is
calibrated and maintained according to manufacturer
specifications.
3. If results show unexpected patterns or poor quality, repeat
analysis or consult a supervisor.
4. Document all controls, calibration data, and troubleshooting
steps.
F) Reporting Results
1. Ensure that all results are reviewed and verified by a senior
technologist or supervisor.
2. Report findings in the laboratory information system (LIS)
according to site-specific guidelines.
3. Highlight critical or unusual findings and ensure appropriate
follow-up steps.
4. Maintain records of all results, including raw data and analysis
reports, for future reference and quality audits.
