Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase Protocol for Immunoglobulin Kappa Free Light
Chain (SFLC) Testing in Spinal Fluid
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the analytical phase procedures
for generating results for Immunoglobulin Kappa Free Light Chain
(SFLC) in spinal fluid (CSF) samples. This protocol ensures accurate
and reliable results, adheres to standard guidelines, and maintains
compliance with regulatory requirements.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to laboratory personnel trained in immunoglobulin
testing, specifically those performing SFLC analysis in CSF samples.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all laboratory personnel conducting SFLC
testing to follow the procedures outlined in this document
meticulously to ensure consistency and accuracy in results.
Supervisors are responsible for overseeing the adherence to these
procedures and addressing any issues or discrepancies.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Acceptable Specimen Types:
• Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) collected in a sterile container.
Unacceptable Specimen Types:
• CSF samples with visible signs of contamination or hemolysis.
• Samples collected in non-sterile containers or those not properly
labeled.
Stability:
• CSF samples are stable at 2-8°C for 48 hours. If longer storage is
required, samples should be frozen at -20°C.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Immunoglobulin Kappa Free Light Chain assay kits (validated and
not expired)
• Calibrator set for SFLC assay
• Quality control materials (low, medium, high)
• Standard laboratory equipment: pipettes, centrifuge, vortex mixer
• Sterile test tubes, racks, and other consumables
6. PROCEDURE
Specimen Handling:
1. Receive and verify CSF samples ensuring proper labeling with
patient identification and collection time/date.
2. Document specimen receipt and condition in the laboratory
information system (LIS).
Preparation:
1. Thoroughly mix the CSF sample by gentle inversion and allow it
to come to room temperature.
2. Prepare necessary reagents, calibration standards, and
controls according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Assay Setup:
1. Load the calibrators, controls, and patient specimens onto the
analytical instrument following specific equipment instructions.
2. Ensure all entries in the LIS match the corresponding specimen
identifiers.
Run Conditions:
1. Select appropriate assay settings for the SFLC test according
to the manufacturer’s protocol.
2. Start the assay run and monitor instrument performance.
Troubleshooting Procedures:
1. If assay results fall outside acceptable ranges, review potential
causes (e.g., reagent handling, instrument error) and repeat the
analysis.
2. For continuous issues, notify the supervisor and consult the
equipment's technical support.
Post-Analysis:
1. Verify the results by reviewing quality control results and
instrument flags.
2. If necessary, centrifuge a small aliquot of the CSF sample to
check for integrity issues (e.g., hemolysis) and adjust reporting
accordingly.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
Internal QC:
• Perform SFLC controls at the beginning of each assay run to
validate instrument calibration and assay performance.
• Record QC results in LIS and review for consistency and
compliance with predefined control limits.
External Proficiency Testing:
• Participate in external proficiency testing programs as per
laboratory policy.
• Review and assess proficiency test results to ensure assay
accuracy and reliability.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
Result Verification:
• Results are automatically transmitted to the LIS and must be
reviewed and verified by the technologist.
• Anomalous results or flagged specimens should be re-assessed
or re-analyzed as necessary.
Critical Results:
• Notify the ordering physician immediately for any critical results,
documenting communication in the LIS.
• Follow site-specific guidelines for repeat critical values.
Reference Intervals:
• Immunoglobulin Kappa Free Light Chain, CSF: [Define specific
reference interval based on assay validation data]
9. MAINTENANCE AND CALIBRATION
Routine Maintenance:
• Follow manufacturer’s instructions for routine maintenance of
analytical instruments.
• Document any maintenance performed.
Annual Calibration:
• Perform annual calibration of instruments using traceable
standards.
• Retain calibration certificates for verification.
10. RECORD KEEPING AND DOCUMENTATION
Retention Policy:
• Maintain records of all assays, QC data, and calibration
certificates in accordance with laboratory retention policies.
• Ensure all documentation is complete, legible, and readily
available for inspection.
This protocol is subject to revision and updates to continuously
improve performance and adherence to regulatory changes.
