Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Immunoglobulin M (IgM)
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the procedures and responsibilities for the
accurate and timely analysis of Immunoglobulin M (IgM) levels in
patient samples. The goal is to ensure the accuracy and reliability of
test results, consistently adhering to CLIA regulations.
Responsibility:
• Clinical laboratory scientists and technologists are responsible for
performing the IgM analysis, documenting all actions, and
ensuring compliance with this SOP.
• Supervisors are responsible for monitoring the performance of
laboratory staff and ensuring proper documentation of the
activities, including corrective actions as needed.
1. PROCEDURE
2.1 Equipment and Reagents:
• Automated immunoassay analyzer (e.g., Roche Cobas, Siemens
IMMULITE, etc.)
• IgM reagent kits specific to the automated analyzer
• Quality control (QC) materials (2 levels: normal and abnormal)
• Calibrators provided by the reagent kit manufacturer
• General laboratory supplies (pipettes, tips, tubes, etc.)
2.2 Calibration and Quality Control:
• Calibrate the analyzer according to the manufacturer’s
instructions, using the provided calibrators.
• Perform calibration verification as necessary, especially when new
reagent lots are introduced or as required by CLIA regulations.
• Analyze QC materials at the beginning and end of each batch of
samples to monitor the performance of the assay. Document QC
results and ensure they fall within the acceptable range defined
by the laboratory.
2.3 Sample Preparation:
• Verify that patient samples meet acceptance criteria (e.g., no
hemolysis, lipemia, or icteric interference). Any problems should
be documented, and the sample should be rejected if necessary.
• Adequately mix samples before analysis to ensure homogeneity.
2.4 Analyzing Patient Samples:
• Load patient samples onto the analyzer according to the specific
requirements outlined in the analyzer’s user manual.
• Ensure that the analyzer is set to the correct assay protocol for
IgM.
• Run the samples following the manufacturer’s protocol.
2.5 Reporting and Documentation:
• Review and validate the results generated by the analyzer. Pay
special attention to any flagged (e.g., high or low) results or any
error messages.
• Document any manual reviews or interventions performed during
the validation process.
• Enter validated results into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS). Include any necessary comments or notes related to the
sample or analysis.
2.6 Troubleshooting and Corrective Actions:
• If QC results are not within the acceptable range, do not proceed
with patient sample analysis. Investigate and identify the problem,
rerun QC, and document corrective actions taken.
• For any analyzer errors or malfunctions, follow the
troubleshooting guide provided by the manufacturer. Document
the issue, actions taken, and any communication with the
technical support service.
2.7 Maintenance:
• Perform daily, weekly, and monthly maintenance on the analyzer
as recommended by the manufacturer. Document all maintenance
activities in the maintenance log.
• Ensure proper storage and handling of reagents and calibrators
as per the manufacturer’s instructions to ensure their stability and
performance.
1. REFERENCE RANGES AND CRITICAL VALUES:
• Reference ranges for IgM must be established in the laboratory
based on the population or adopted from recognized sources.
• Critical values: Define and document if a critical threshold for IgM
results exists, which requires immediate notification of the
clinician.
1. REFERENCES:
• Manufacturer’s assay-specific package insert for the IgM reagent
kit.
• Laboratory-specific LIS manual and reporting guidelines.
• Manufacturer’s user manual and troubleshooting guide for the
automated analyzer.
By adhering to these procedures, the laboratory ensures that IgM
results are generated accurately and reliably, maintaining the highest
standards of patient care and compliance with regulatory
requirements.
