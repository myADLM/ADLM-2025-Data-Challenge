Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
1. PURPOSE
To outline the analytical phase protocol for generating results for
Immunoglobulin M (IgM), Serum, ensuring accurate and reliable
assay performance and results.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing and
documenting the IgM analysis according to this procedure. All staff
are responsible for identifying any issues that may affect the test
results and reporting them to the supervisor. Staff and supervisors
ensure all actions comply with this protocol.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENT
• Specimen Type: Serum
• Preferred Collection Container: SST (serum separator tube)
• Acceptable Collection Container: Red-top tube
• Volume Required: Minimum 2 mL of serum
• Stability:
◦ Room temperature: 8 hours
◦ Refrigerated (2-8°C): 48 hours
◦ Frozen (-20°C or below): 1 month
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed specimens
• Specimens in other anticoagulants like EDTA, heparin, etc.
• Specimens not meeting the above stability requirements
1. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• Immunoglobulin M (IgM) assay kits (commercially available)
• Calibration standards specific for IgM
• Quality control materials at two levels (low and high)
• Microplate reader or automated immunoassay analyzer
• Pipettes and tips
• Centrifuge
• Refrigeration (2-8°C)
• Freezer (-20°C or below)
1. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Preparation:
1. Centrifuge SST/red-top tube specimens at 1500-2000 x g for 10
minutes to separate serum from blood cells.
2. Transfer the serum into labeled polypropylene microtubes.
3. Store serum aliquots as per stability criteria until analysis.
B. Assay Procedure:
1. Allow reagents and serum samples to reach room temperature
prior to analysis.
2. Prepare calibration standards and quality control materials
following manufacturer guidelines.
3. Follow steps in IgM assay kit insert for performing the test.
Typically includes: a. Addition of serum samples, calibrators,
and controls to wells or reaction sites. b. Addition of enzyme-
linked antibodies specific for IgM. c. Incubation according to
assay requirements (temperature and duration). d. Washing
steps to remove non-specific binding. e. Addition of substrate
solution for detection.
4. Read the assay results on a microplate reader or automated
analyzer at specified wavelength and record data.
C. Quality Control:
1. Run quality control samples at low and high levels at the start of
each batch of assays.
2. Ensure all QC results are within acceptable ranges prior to
proceeding with patient sample analysis.
3. Document QC results and any corrective actions in the quality
control log.
4. RESULT INTERPRETATION AND REPORTING
A. Data Analysis:
1. Calculate IgM concentrations in patient samples using the
calibration curve prepared during the assay.
2. Ensure all controls are within acceptable ranges before
accepting patient results.
B. Reporting Results:
1. Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
following site-specific reporting guidelines.
2. Verify accuracy of data entry before final result submission.
Reference Intervals:
• IgM: 40-230 mg/dL (May vary with specific assay kit used; verify
with package insert).
Critical Values:
• Note any results which significantly deviate from the reference
interval and follow critical values reporting guidelines.
C. Documentation:
1. Record all assay details, including sample IDs, reagent lot
numbers, calibration data, QC results, and technician initials.
2. Document any deviations, troubleshooting steps taken, and
remarks.
