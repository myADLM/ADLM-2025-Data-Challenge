Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Immunoglobulin Profile
Analysis
1. PURPOSE: To outline the standardized method for the analytical
phase in generating results for immunoglobulin profile including IgG,
IgA, IgM, IgE and IgD. Ensuring accurate, reliable, and reproducible
results with clearly defined procedures.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing the
procedures and ensuring all steps are followed precisely.
• Supervisors must oversee the process, ensure equipment is
functioning correctly, and address any deviations or issues.
2. DEFINITION: The immunoglobulin profile consists of quantitative
measurements of immunoglobulins (IgG, IgA, IgM, IgE, IgD) in serum
or plasma using analytical techniques such as nephelometry or
turbidimetry.
3. PROCEDURE:
A. Equipment and Reagents:
• Autoanalyzer (e.g., Siemens BN ProSpec)
• Calibrators and controls specific for each immunoglobulin
• Quality Control samples (at least two levels - normal and
abnormal)
• Sample tubes: Serum separator tubes (SST) or plasma (EDTA
tubes)
• Disposable pipettes/tips and necessary lab ware
B. Specimen Requirements:
• Preferred: Serum obtained from venipuncture collected in SST.
• Acceptable: Plasma collected in EDTA tubes.
• Sample should be centrifuged and separated within 2 hours of
collection.
• Specimens must be kept at 2-8°C and analyzed within 48 hours.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples
• Specimens with incorrect or missing identification
• Samples stored for more than 48 hours without freezing at -20°C
or lower.
C. Calibration and Quality Control:
• Perform and verify calibration using manufacturer-provided
calibrators as per the analyzer’s operation manual.
• Run quality control samples with each batch of patient samples.
• Document all QC results and ensure they are within the
acceptable range before proceeding with patient samples.
D. Detailed Procedure:
1. Preparation:
◦ Allow samples, calibrators, and controls to reach room
temperature if refrigerated.
◦ Mix samples gently by inversion. Avoid foaming.
◦ Load samples into sample racks on the analyzer.
2. Loading and Setup:
◦ Follow the manufacturer's instructions on the analyzer to
load reagents and samples.
◦ Enter sample IDs and their corresponding patient
information into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
3. Running the Analysis:
◦ Select the immunoglobulin profile test on the analyzer.
◦ Ensure that sufficient reagent, QC material, and waste
capacity are available.
◦ Start the run according to the analyzer’s operating
procedures.
◦ Monitor the analyzer during the run for any error messages
or warnings and troubleshoot as necessary.
◦ Upon completion, print and/or review the results on the
analyzer screen.
E. Post-Analysis:
• Verify that all QC results are within acceptable limits before
accepting patient results.
• Ensure that each immunoglobulin level is reported within the
reference range or flagged if outside the normal range.
• Results are reviewed by the technologist in charge and verified in
the LIS.
4. REPORTING RESULTS:
• Results must be entered, verified, and reviewed in the LIS by the
authorized technologist.
• Any critical values should be reported immediately to the
requesting physician following the laboratory's critical value policy.
5. QUALITY CONTROL AND MAINTENANCE:
• Perform daily, weekly, and monthly maintenance on the analyzer
as per the manufacturer’s recommendations.
• Record all maintenance activities in the log book.
• Conduct periodic review and correlation studies to ensure the
accuracy and precision of results.
• Calibrate the analyzer periodically and whenever QC fails to meet
the acceptable criteria.
6. REFERENCES:
• Analyzer’s operation manual and relevant product inserts for
reagents and calibration materials.
• Laboratory quality management system documentation.
• Relevant guidelines from accrediting and regulatory bodies (e.g.,
Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)).

Note: This SOP is intended for trained personnel within a CLIA-
certified laboratory setting. Regular training and competency
evaluations should be conducted to ensure adherence to this
protocol.
