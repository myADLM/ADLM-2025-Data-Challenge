Title: Standard Operating Procedure for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Immunoglobulin Total Light Chains, Urine
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the analysis of
Immunoglobulin Total Light Chains in urine specimens to ensure
accurate and reliable results.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of designated staff to perform and document
the analysis of Immunoglobulin Total Light Chains in urine specimens
following this protocol. Supervisors are responsible for ensuring that
the procedure is followed, and for addressing any deviations or
issues that may arise during the analytical process.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/acceptable:
• Freshly voided urine collected in a sterile container.
• For optimal stability, process and analyze specimens within 6
hours of collection. If immediate analysis is not possible,
refrigerate the specimen at 2-8°C and analyze within 24 hours.
Unacceptable:
• Specimens received in the laboratory more than 24 hours after
collection.
• Specimens without clearly labeled collection date/time.
• Specimens contaminated or showing signs of bacterial growth.
1. MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT
• Immunoglobulin Total Light Chain assay kit (Manufacturer: XXXX)
• Reagents and controls as specified by the assay kit
• Automated immunoassay analyzer (Model: XXXX)
• Centrifuge
• Pipettes and tips
• Sterile urine containers
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
1. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Verify specimen integrity (e.g., no contamination, properly
labeled).
2. If specimen was refrigerated, bring to room temperature prior to
analysis.
3. Mix specimen thoroughly.
Assay Setup:
1. Prepare reagents and controls as per the manufacturer's
instructions.
2. Calibrate the immunoassay analyzer using the provided
standards.
Specimen Analysis:
1. Load specimen onto the automated immunoassay analyzer.
2. Execute the assay protocol defined by the immunoassay kit
instructions.
◦ Incubation periods
◦ Washing steps
◦ Detection and quantification processes
Reading Results:
1. Record the results generated by the analyzer.
2. Review the quality control data to ensure the validity of the
assay results.
3. If quality control fails, troubleshoot as per manufacturer's
guidelines and repeat analysis.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
5. Run internal quality controls with each batch of specimens.
6. Document control results in the Quality Control Log.
7. Review control performance to ensure assay validity.
8. If controls fall outside acceptable limits, identify and rectify the
issue prior to specimen analysis.
9. REPORTING RESULTS
10. Verify results from the analyzer.
11. Ensure all manual entries and digital records are correct.
12. Report results through the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
13. Ensure proper documentation of the result verification process.
14. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Refer to the assay kit insert for specific reference intervals for
Immunoglobulin Total Light Chains in urine.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the assay kit insert for limitations related to interferences,
specificity, and sensitivity.
1. REFERENCES
Assay kit insert and manufacturer's instructions should be referenced
for detailed information and any updates regarding the analytical
procedure.
