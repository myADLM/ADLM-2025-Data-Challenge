Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Immunotyping, Serum
with Interpretation
1. PURPOSE
This SOP provides detailed instructions for the analytical phase of
generating results for immunotyping in serum samples, ensuring
uniformity, accuracy, and reliability of the test results.
Responsibility: This protocol must be followed by trained laboratory
personnel who are responsible for handling, analyzing, and
interpreting immunotyping tests.
1. DEFINITION
Immunotyping refers to the identification of immunoglobulin subtypes
present in a serum sample. It is often utilized to diagnose various
disorders such as multiple myeloma, lymphoma, and other immune
conditions.
1. SPECIMEN
• Preferred: Serum from a 5-7 mL blood sample collected in a red-
top or serum separator tube (SST).
• Stability: Serum should be separated from the clot within 2 hours
of collection and stored at 2-8°C if not analyzed immediately.
Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Immunotyping reagent kit (specific to the instrument used)
• Calibrators and controls
• ELISA/chemiluminescence analyzer or equivalent instrumentation
• Micropipettes and tips
• Centrifuge
• Storage vials
• Thermometers (if required for reagent storage)
• PBS (Phosphate-Buffered Saline)
1. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation
1. Centrifugation: Centrifuge the serum tube at 3500 RPM for 10
minutes at room temperature to separate the serum.
2. Aliquoting: Aliquot the serum into labeled storage vials if not
analyzed immediately, and store appropriately.
B. Reagent and Control Preparation
1. Reagent Storage: Store reagents according to the
manufacturer’s instructions (typically 2-8°C). Do not use
reagents past their expiration dates.
2. Control Preparation: Prepare control sera provided with the kit
to be used as standards alongside patient samples.
C. Calibration and Reagent Maintenance
1. Calibration: Follow the instrument’s manual for calibration
procedures using provided calibrators. Document all
calibrations in the instrument log.
2. Reagent Maintenance: Prepare reagents according to the kit’s
instructions. Warm reagents to room temperature before use if
required.
D. Sample Analysis
1. Loading Samples: Load the patient serum samples,
calibrators, and controls onto the instrument following the
manufacturer’s protocol.
2. Running the Assay: Start the assay as per the instrument’s
SOP.
E. Result Interpretation
1. Review Data: Once assay is complete, review the generated
data for accuracy and ensure that internal controls are within
established limits.
2. Data Calculation: Utilize the instrument’s software to
determine the immunoglobulin subtypes present in the patient
serum.
3. Quality Control: Ensure that all quality control parameters are
met before validating patient results.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform internal quality control per batch run:
◦ Run positive and negative controls with each batch of
samples.
◦ Log all control results and take corrective action in case of
deviations.
• Maintain all quality control records for compliance and audits.
• Participate in external proficiency testing programs as required.
• Perform instrument maintenance and calibration as per the
manufacturer’s instructions.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Data Entry: Enter validated data into the laboratory information
system (LIS).
• Result Verification: Results must be reviewed and verified by a
qualified technologist or supervisor before final reporting.
• Interpretation: Provide a detailed interpretation of the
immunotyping results in the final report, noting any abnormalities,
potential diagnoses, or recommendations for further testing if
necessary.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Refer to the manufacturer's insert for detailed reference intervals for
specific immunoglobulin subtypes. Update and validate these
intervals based on population differences and laboratory standards.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the reagent kit insert and instrumentation manual for
limitations of the method, ensuring awareness of any factors that may
lead to erroneous results.
