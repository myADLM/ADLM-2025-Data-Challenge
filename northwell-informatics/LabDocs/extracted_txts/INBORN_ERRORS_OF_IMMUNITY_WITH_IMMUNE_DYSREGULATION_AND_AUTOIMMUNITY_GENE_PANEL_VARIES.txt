Standard Operating Procedure
Title: Analytical Phase for Generating Results for Inborn Errors
of Immunity with Immune Dysregulation and Autoimmunity
Gene Panel
1. PURPOSE
To outline the steps and quality control measures required in the
analytical phase for processing samples and generating results for
the Inborn Errors of Immunity with Immune Dysregulation and
Autoimmunity Gene Panel.
2. SCOPE
This SOP is applicable to all laboratory personnel performing the
analytical phase of testing for inborn errors of immunity including
immune dysregulation and autoimmunity using the designated gene
panel.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory technologist to
perform the analysis, document the findings, and ensure the data
integrity and accuracy. Supervisors must oversee the process and
ensure compliance with the SOP.
4. DEFINITIONS
Gene Panel: A targeted sequencing approach used to analyze
multiple genes associated with a specific condition or set of
conditions.
Inborn Errors of Immunity: Genetic disorders that can cause immune
system dysfunction leading to immunodeficiency, autoimmunity, and
other immune-related complications.
5. EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS
• Sequencing platform (e.g., Illumina MiSeq, NextSeq)
• DNA Extraction Kit
• PCR reagents and thermal cycler
• Quality Control Material (e.g., control DNA samples)
• Bioinformatics software for data analysis (e.g., GATK, FastQC)
6. PROCEDURE
A) Sample Preparation
1. DNA Extraction:
◦ Extract genomic DNA from the submitted specimen using a
commercial DNA extraction kit following the manufacturer's
protocol.
◦ Quantify and assess the quality of the DNA using a
spectrophotometer and fluorometer.
2. Library Preparation:
◦ Prepare DNA libraries using the designated gene panel
library preparation kit.
◦ Perform PCR amplification to enrich targeted regions
according to the kit instructions.
◦ Purify and quantify the amplified libraries.
3. Sequencing:
◦ Load libraries onto the sequencing platform following the
manufacturer’s guidelines.
◦ Set up and initiate the sequencing run.
B) Data Analysis
1. Primary Analysis:
◦ Collect raw sequence data generated by the sequencing
platform.
◦ Perform initial quality checks using FastQC software.
2. Sequence Alignment:
◦ Align sequence reads to the reference genome using
bioinformatics tools such as BWA or Bowtie.
◦ Remove duplicate reads and perform base quality
recalibration using GATK.
3. Variant Calling:
◦ Identify variants (SNPs, indels) in the targeted genes using
GATK HaplotypeCaller or another validated variant caller.
◦ Annotate variants using software tools (e.g., ANNOVAR,
VEP).
C) Interpretation and Reporting
1. Variant Interpretation:
◦ Classify variants based on pathogenicity using established
guidelines (e.g., ACMG criteria).
◦ Review variants in the context of the patient’s clinical
presentation and reference databases (e.g., ClinVar).
2. Quality Control:
◦ Perform quality control checks at each step of the process
(e.g., library preparation, sequencing, data analysis) using
control DNA samples.
◦ Ensure the quality of sequencing reads meets acceptable
thresholds (e.g., > Q30 for >80% of bases).
3. Report Generation:
◦ Generate a comprehensive report outlining the identified
variants and their clinical significance.
◦ Include any relevant quality control data in the report.
◦ Review the report and ensure accuracy before finalizing.
7. DOCUMENTATION
• Record all relevant information in the laboratory information
management system (LIMS).
• Documentation must include DNA extraction details, library
preparation specifics, sequencing run information, and data
analysis outputs.
• Maintain sample integrity records and ensure accurate reporting.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform routine quality checks using standard control materials.
• Document any deviations from the protocol and corrective actions
taken.
• Participate in external proficiency testing annually to ensure
compliance with regulatory standards.
