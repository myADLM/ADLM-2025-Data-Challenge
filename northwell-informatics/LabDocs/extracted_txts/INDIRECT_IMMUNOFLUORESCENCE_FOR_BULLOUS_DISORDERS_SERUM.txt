Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Indirect Immunofluorescence
for Bullous Disorders, Serum
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedure for performing
indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) assays to detect autoantibodies
associated with bullous disorders in serum samples. This will ensure
accurate, reliable, and reproducible results to aid in the diagnosis and
management of diseases such as Bullous Pemphigoid, Pemphigus
Vulgaris, Epidermolysis Bullosa Acquisita, and other related
conditions.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of trained laboratory personnel to perform IIF
assays according to this protocol. Supervisors must ensure
compliance with this SOP, accuracy of results, and implementation of
corrective actions if deviations occur.
1. SPECIMEN
Specimen Type:
• Serum
Specimen Collection:
• Collect venous blood into a red-topped tube or serum separator
tube (SST).
• Allow the blood to clot at room temperature for 30 minutes.
• Centrifuge the clotted blood at 1500 x g for 10 minutes to
separate the serum.
• Aliquot the serum into a labeled, sterile tube.
Specimen Storage:
• Serum samples may be stored at 2-8°C for up to 72 hours. For
long-term storage, freeze at -20°C or lower.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Immunofluorescence microscope
• Micro-pipettes and tips
• Incubator set at 37°C
• Centrifuge
Reagents:
• Slides coated with appropriate substrate (e.g., monkey
esophagus, human skin)
• FITC-labeled anti-human IgG conjugates
• PBS buffer (pH 7.4)
• Mounting medium
• Positive control serum (well characterized)
• Negative control serum
Supplies:
• Humid chamber
• Coverslips
• Immersion oil
• Microscopic slides
• Disposable gloves
1. PROCEDURE
5.1. Preparation of Slides
• Retrieve the antigen-coated slides and allow them to equilibrate to
room temperature.
• Label each well of the slide with the patient’s identifier and the
appropriate controls.
5.2. Incubation with Serum Samples
• Dilute patient serum and control sera 1:10 with PBS buffer.
• Add 20 µL of the diluted serum to each well. Ensure complete
coverage of the substrate surface.
• Incubate the slides in a humid chamber at 37°C for 30 minutes.
5.3. Washing
• Gently rinse the slides with PBS to remove unbound serum.
• Wash slides with PBS in a Coplin jar, changing the buffer every 5
minutes for a total of 3 washes.
5.4. Incubation with Secondary Antibody
• Add 20 µL of FITC-labeled anti-human IgG to each well.
• Incubate the slides in a humid chamber at 37°C for 30 minutes,
protected from light.
5.5. Final Washing
• Repeat the washing steps with PBS as described in 5.3.
• Rinse briefly in distilled water to remove excess PBS.
5.6. Mounting
• Add a small drop of mounting medium onto each well.
• Carefully apply a coverslip, avoiding air bubbles.
5.7. Microscopy
• Examine the slides under an immunofluorescence microscope
using appropriate filter settings for FITC.
• Assess the samples for specific binding patterns typical of bullous
dermatoses. Common patterns include:
◦ Linear pattern along the basement membrane (e.g., Bullous
Pemphigoid)
◦ Intercellular spaces of the epidermis (e.g., Pemphigus
Vulgaris)
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include a known positive and negative serum control in each
batch of tests to ensure assay validity.
• The positive control should show the expected
immunofluorescence pattern, and the negative control should
show no specific fluorescence.
• Document and analyze all control results; initiate troubleshooting
and corrective actions if controls do not exhibit expected results.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Report results qualitatively (e.g., positive or negative) and
semiquantitatively (e.g., titer level).
• Document the specific immunofluorescence pattern and intensity,
noting the key observations that support diagnostic
interpretations.
• Provide comprehensive results to the requesting clinician.
1. REFERENCES
• Protocols and guidelines from recognized pathology and
laboratory medicine bodies.
• Manufacturer’s instructions for reagents and immunofluorescence
microscopy.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Interpret results with consideration of clinical presentation and
other diagnostic tests.
• Formaldehyde-fixed tissues may yield false positives; ensure
slides are properly prepared.
• Fluorescence intensity can diminish over time; read slides
promptly.
1. SAFETY PRECAUTIONS
• Handle all biological specimens and reagents with appropriate
biosafety practices.
• Wear personal protective equipment (PPE) including gloves, lab
coat, and safety goggles.
• Dispose of biohazard waste according to institutional protocols.
This SOP should be reviewed periodically and updated as necessary
to reflect the latest best practices and regulatory requirements.
