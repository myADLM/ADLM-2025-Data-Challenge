Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: INFECTION PREVENTION CANDIDA AURIS PCR,
SURVEILLANCE
1. PURPOSE
To establish a consistent and accurate procedure for the detection of
Candida auris from clinical specimens using Polymerase Chain
Reaction (PCR) for surveillance purposes, enabling timely infection
prevention and control measures.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of the trained laboratory staff to perform this
procedure accurately and in accordance with established protocols.
Staff are required to identify any deviations or issues and report them
to their supervisor.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen Type:
• Preferred: Swabs from the skin, axilla, groin, orifices, or other
colonization sites.
Transport and Stability:
• Specimens should be transported to the laboratory immediately.
• If immediate transport is not possible, specimens should be
stored at 2-8°C and transported within 24 hours.
• Specimens that exceed 24-hour storage or are improperly stored
shall be considered unacceptable for analysis.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens that are dried out or incomplete.
• Specimens with no clear labelling (patient identification, collection
site, date and time of collection).
• Specimens that are broken or leaking.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Real-time PCR instrument
• Biosafety cabinet
• Microcentrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Pipettes and sterile pipette tips
Reagents:
• Candida auris-specific PCR Master Mix
• DNA extraction kit
• Positive control DNA
• Negative control (no template) DNA
• Nuclease-free water
Supplies:
• Sterile swabs
• Microcentrifuge tubes
• PCR tubes or plates
• Gloves, lab coat, and other personal protective equipment (PPE)
1. PCR PROCEDURE
A) Preparation
1. Wear appropriate PPE.
2. Clean and disinfect work areas before starting the procedure.
3. Prepare and label PCR reaction tubes or plates with the
necessary number of reactions, controls, and samples.
4. Perform all steps in the biosafety cabinet to avoid
contamination.
B) DNA Extraction
1. Vortex and centrifuge the samples to ensure proper mixing.
2. Add the sample to the lysis buffer in the DNA extraction kit
according to the manufacturer's instructions.
3. Complete the DNA extraction protocol as outlined in the kit
instructions.
4. Elute the DNA into a clean microcentrifuge tube and store it at
2-8°C if not proceeding immediately to PCR.
C) PCR Assay Setup
1. Thaw and gently mix all reagents before use.
2. Prepare the PCR Master Mix according to the following
example for a 25 µL reaction (adapt as necessary for the
specific Master Mix used):
◦ 12.5 µL of 2X PCR Master Mix
◦ 0.5 µL of forward primer (10 µM)
◦ 0.5 µL of reverse primer (10 µM)
◦ 0.5 µL of probe (10 µM)
◦ 6 µL of nuclease-free water
◦ 5 µL of extracted DNA sample (for templates)
◦ 5 µL of positive control DNA (for positive control)
◦ 5 µL of nuclease-free water (for negative control)
3. Aliquot 20 µL of the prepared PCR Master Mix into each PCR
reaction tube or well.
4. Add 5 µL of the extracted DNA, positive control, or nuclease-
free water to the respective wells.
5. Seal the PCR tubes or plates and briefly centrifuge to remove
air bubbles.
D) PCR Cycling Conditions
1. Turn on the real-time PCR instrument and select the
appropriate program:
◦ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 10 minutes
◦ 40 cycles of:
▪ Denaturation: 95°C for 15 seconds
▪ Annealing and extension: 60°C for 60 seconds (data
collection step)
2. Insert the PCR tubes or plates into the instrument and start the
run.
3. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
4. Analyze the data according to the real-time PCR instrument’s
software instructions.
5. Positive control must show a clear positive result to validate the
assay run.
6. Negative control must show no amplification; if amplification is
observed, the run is invalid due to contamination.
Result Interpretation:
• A sample is considered positive if amplification is observed within
40 cycles.
• A sample is considered negative if no amplification is observed
within 40 cycles.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
2. Run quality control tests with each batch of samples (positive
and negative controls).
3. Ensure that all controls fall within expected ranges.
4. Document any deviations from expected results and take
corrective actions as necessary.
5. REPORTING RESULTS
6. Record and report results following site-specific reporting
guidelines.
7. Positive results indicate the presence of Candida auris and
should trigger immediate infection prevention and control
measures.
8. Negative results indicate no detectable Candida auris in the
sample analyzed.
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Poor quality specimens, contamination, and technical errors can
lead to false-negative or false-positive results.
• Interpretation should consider the clinical context and additional
information from other diagnostic procedures.
