Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for VRE Culture
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedures and responsibilities for the identification
and reporting of Vancomycin-Resistant Enterococcus (VRE) culture
results to ensure accurate and timely detection, which are crucial for
infection prevention and control.
1. DEFINITIONS
Vancomycin-Resistant Enterococcus (VRE): A bacterial strain of
Enterococcus that has developed resistance to the antibiotic
vancomycin, often associated with healthcare-associated infections.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
Laboratory technologists are responsible for performing the testing
procedure, documenting the results, and initiating the appropriate
quality control measures. It is the responsibility of the supervisor to
ensure that procedures are followed correctly and to deal with any
discrepancies or issues that arise during the testing process.
1. SPECIMEN HANDLING
Specimen (previously accessioned):
• Ensure that the specimen is properly labeled and received within
acceptable time frames and conditions.
• Types of specimens may include rectal swabs, stool samples, or
other clinical specimens as per the physician’s request.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Tryptic Soy Broth (TSB) with 6.5% NaCl and Vancomycin
• Bile Esculin Azide Agar
• Vancomycin MIC strips or disks
• Incubator capable of maintaining 35-37°C
• Streaking loops and inoculating needles
• Control strains: VRE-positive control and VRE-negative control
• PPE as per laboratory safety guidelines
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run VRE-positive and VRE-negative control strains daily to
ensure media and reagents are functioning properly.
• Record temperatures of incubators and ensure they are within the
specified range of 35-37°C daily.
1. PROCEDURE
A) Broth Enrichment Phase:
1. Label the TSB with Vancomycin tubes with the appropriate
patient identifiers.
2. Inoculate the specimen into the TSB with Vancomycin broth
using a sterile swab or loop, and incubate at 35-37°C for 24
hours.
3. Observe the enrichment broth for visible turbidity or growth.
B) Agar Plate Culturing:
1. Using a sterile loop, streak a small amount of the enriched
broth onto a Bile Esculin Azide Agar plate supplemented with
Vancomycin.
2. Streak for isolation to obtain single colonies and incubate the
plates at 35-37°C for 24-48 hours.
3. Examine the plates for characteristic black colonies indicating
possible VRE.
C) Confirmation and Susceptibility Testing:
1. Select characteristic colonies and perform a Vancomycin MIC
test by placing a Vancomycin MIC strip or disk onto a fresh
plate streaked with the suspected VRE isolate.
2. Incubate the plate at 35-37°C for 24 hours.
3. Measure and interpret the inhibition zone as per the CLSI
guidelines.
4. Any isolate with a Vancomycin MIC ≥32 µg/mL is confirmed as
VRE.
5. REPORTING RESULTS
• Record results in the laboratory information system (LIS).
• Report negative cultures as “No VRE Isolated”.
• Report positive cultures with the MIC value and as “Vancomycin
Resistant Enterococcus Isolated”.
• Notify the Infection Prevention and Control team immediately
upon detection of a positive VRE culture.
1. DOCUMENTATION
• Maintain a log of all specimens processed for VRE culture,
including quality control results.
• Document corrective actions taken for any out-of-range quality
control results.
1. REFERENCES
• Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines.
• Manufacturer’s package inserts for reagents and supplies.
• Laboratory safety and infection control manuals.
1. REVISION
• SOP will be reviewed annually or as necessary based on updates
to references or laboratory practices and procedures.
