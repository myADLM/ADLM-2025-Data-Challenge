INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASE SEROLOGY PANEL, SERUM
(IBD Panel) SOP
1. PURPOSE
To outline the standardized procedure for analyzing the Inflammatory
Bowel Disease (IBD) Serology Panel in serum samples using
immunoassays or ELISA (Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay) to
identify specific antibodies related to Inflammatory Bowel Disease.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory personnel will perform all steps as described
in this procedure, ensuring adherence to quality control measures
and accurate result reporting. Supervisors are responsible for
ensuring compliance and addressing any deviations or issues
promptly.
1. DEFINITION
The Inflammatory Bowel Disease Serology Panel includes tests that
detect and measure various antibodies implicated in IBD. Common
antibodies measured include: Anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae
antibodies (ASCA), perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies
(pANCA), and potentially others depending on the panel
configuration.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/Acceptable:
• Serum extracted from a blood sample collected in an SST tube
(Serum Separator Tube).
• Blood samples must be allowed to clot naturally before
centrifugation.
• Serum should be separated and stored at 2-8°C if not
immediately processed.
• Serum samples can be frozen at -20°C or colder for extended
storage, avoiding repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
Unacceptable:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric serum samples.
• Serum samples contaminated with anticoagulants or
preservatives.
• Samples that have not been stored appropriately or are outside of
the stability window.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• ELISA reader
• Centrifuge
• Micropipettes and tips
• Incubators or water baths
Reagents and Supplies:
• Commercially available IBD Serology Panel test kits
• Calibrators, controls (positive and negative), and conjugates as
provided in the test kit
• Wash buffer and substrate solutions
• Distilled or deionized water
• Reagent reservoirs
• ELISA microplates
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation and Setup
• Check the kit expiration date and ensure all reagents and
samples are at room temperature before beginning.
• Label the ELISA microplate appropriately with patient
identification, controls, and calibrators.
B. Sample and Reagent Preparation
• Prepare the wash buffer and substrate solutions as per the
manufacturer’s instructions.
• Dilute serum samples if required following kit instructions.
• Reconstitute or dilute calibrators and controls as instructed in the
kit manual.
C. Assay Procedure
• Add the appropriate volume of standards, controls, and patient
serum samples to the designated wells in the ELISA microplate.
• Incubate the plate at the specified temperature for the indicated
time.
• Wash the plate thoroughly as per the kit instructions to remove
unbound components.
• Add the conjugate reagent to each well and incubate as required.
• Wash the plate again as instructed.
• Add the substrate solution to each well, incubate for the
necessary time, and protect from light.
• Add the stopping solution to each well to halt the reaction.
D. Measurement and Calculation
• Read the absorbance of each well using an ELISA reader at the
wavelength specified by the reagent kit (usually 450 nm or dual-
read 450/620 nm).
• Calculate the results using the provided calibrator curves or
software provided with the ELISA reader.
• Verify that control results are within established ranges before
accepting patient results.
E. Quality Control
• Run positive and negative controls with each batch of patient
samples.
• Verify that control values fall within the acceptable range before
confirming patient results.
• Document all control results, any deviations, and corrective
actions taken.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
accurately.
• Ensure results are reviewed and verified by a technologist.
• Critical values should be reported to the physician immediately as
per the laboratory’s critical results policy.
• Include any relevant comments regarding sample integrity or
limitations encountered during analysis.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolysis, lipemia, and icterus in samples may interfere with
results.
• Cross-reactivity with other antibodies may produce false positive
or negative results.
• Ensure proper sample handling and storage to avoid degradation
of specific antibodies.

1. DOCUMENTATION
• Maintain all records of sample processing, assay runs, and quality
control review in accordance with laboratory policy.
• Ensure all corrective actions for quality control deviations are
documented and reviewed by a supervisor.
