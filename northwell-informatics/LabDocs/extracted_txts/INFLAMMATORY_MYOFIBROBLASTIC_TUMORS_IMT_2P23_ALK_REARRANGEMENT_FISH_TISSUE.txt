Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Generating Results for
Inflammatory Myofibroblastic Tumors (IMT), 2P23 (ALK)
Rearrangement, FISH, Tissue
1. PURPOSE
This SOP describes the procedure for generating and reporting
results for Inflammatory Myofibroblastic Tumors (IMT), 2P23 (ALK)
rearrangement, using Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) on
tissue samples.
Responsibilities:
• Trained laboratory technologists are responsible for performing
the FISH assay and interpreting the results.
• The laboratory supervisor is responsible for ensuring quality
control and verification of results.
• Data entry personnel are responsible for accurately documenting
results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
1. DEFINITION
Inflammatory Myofibroblastic Tumors (IMT): IMTs are rare tumors that
predominantly occur in children and young adults. They can occur in
various anatomical sites and are histologically characterized by
spindle-shaped myofibroblasts and inflammatory cell infiltrates.
2P23 (ALK) Rearrangement: The ALK gene rearrangement is located
on chromosome 2p23 and is a characteristic genetic abnormality in
IMTs. Detection of the ALK rearrangement is crucial for diagnosis and
potential therapeutic decisions.
1. REAGENTS, EQUIPMENT, AND SUPPLIES
• FISH probe specific for ALK gene rearrangement
• Fluorescent-labeled hybridization reagents
• Pretreatment reagents (e.g., pepsin, buffers)
• Tissue fixatives and slides
• Fluorescence microscope with appropriate filters
• Laboratory Information System (LIS) for result entry
• Appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE)
1. PROCEDURE
A. Specimen Preparation:
1. Ensure that the tissue specimen has been appropriately fixed
and embedded in paraffin.
2. Cut 4-5 micron thick sections and mount onto positively
charged slides.
3. Bake slides at 56°C for 1-2 hours to attach the tissue sections
firmly.
B. Pretreatment:
1. Deparaffinize slides using xylene and graded alcohols.
2. Perform antigen retrieval using a suitable buffer and heating
method (e.g., microwave, pressure cooker).
3. Treat sections with pepsin solution to permeabilize the tissues.
4. Rinse slides in 2X saline-sodium citrate (SSC) buffer.
C. Hybridization:
1. Apply the ALK FISH probe to each slide and cover with a
coverslip.
2. Seal coverslip with rubber cement to prevent drying.
3. Denature both the probe and target DNA by incubating the
slides at 75°C for 5 minutes.
4. Hybridize overnight at 37°C in a humidified chamber.
D. Post-Hybridization Washes:
1. Remove coverslip carefully and wash slides in 2X SSC at room
temperature to remove unbound probe.
2. Wash slides in 0.3% NP-40 in 2X SSC at 72°C for 2 minutes.
3. Rinse with distilled water and air-dry in the dark.
E. Counterstaining and Mounting:
1. Apply DAPI (4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) counterstain to
each slide.
2. Mount the slides with a coverslip using an antifade mounting
medium.
F. Microscopy and Analysis:
1. Analyze slides using a fluorescence microscope equipped with
filters for DAPI (blue) and the fluorophore specific to the ALK
probe.
2. Examine at least 200 interphase nuclei to determine the
presence or absence of ALK rearrangement signals.
3. Record the number and pattern of signals observed in each
nucleus.
G. Quality Control:
1. Include positive and negative control slides with each batch of
patient samples.
2. Review results of control slides to confirm assay performance.
3. If controls do not perform as expected, repeat the assay.
4. REPORTING RESULTS
A. Data Entry:
1. Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
including:
◦ Patient demographic information
◦ Tissue site of the sample
◦ Interpretation of FISH signals
◦ Comments on quality control and any assay limitations
B. Interpretation:
1. Determine the presence of ALK rearrangement based on
standardized cutoffs (e.g., percentage of nuclei showing
rearrangement signals).
2. Interpret results as either positive or negative for ALK
rearrangement.
C. Review and Verification:
1. A senior technologist or supervisor must review and verify the
results.
2. Discrepancies should be resolved by re-examining the slides or
repeating the assay if necessary.
D. Reporting:
1. Generate a final report that includes:
◦ Patient identifiers and clinical information
◦ Methodology and probe used
◦ Results of the FISH analysis
◦ Interpretation of results
◦ Comments on any technical issues or limitations
2. Ensure that the report is signed by a qualified pathologist or
laboratory director.
3. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Technical errors in tissue preparation, hybridization, or
microscopy may affect results.
• In cases with equivocal results, additional testing or repeat
analysis may be necessary.

1. REVIEW AND REVISION
This SOP should be reviewed annually or as needed to incorporate
technological advancements, updated protocols, and regulatory
requirements.
By following this SOP, the laboratory ensures consistent and accurate
detection of 2P23 (ALK) rearrangements in Inflammatory
Myofibroblastic Tumors (IMT), contributing to appropriate patient
management and treatment.
