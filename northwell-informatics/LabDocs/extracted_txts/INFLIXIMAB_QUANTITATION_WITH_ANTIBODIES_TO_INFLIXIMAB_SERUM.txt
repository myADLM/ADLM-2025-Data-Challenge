Standard Operating Procedure
Title: Analytical Phase of Generating Results for INFLIXIMAB
QUANTITATION WITH ANTIBODIES TO INFLIXIMAB, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedures for quantifying infliximab levels and
detecting antibodies to infliximab (ATI) in patient serum specimens.
These results support therapeutic drug monitoring and guide clinical
decision-making.
Responsibility:
• Trained laboratory personnel are responsible for performing the
infliximab quantitation and ATI assays, following this SOP
accurately.
• It is the responsibility of the supervisory staff to ensure all
personnel are trained and proficient in this procedure.
• All personnel must report deviations and take corrective actions
as necessary.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Serum
• Collection: Blood should be collected via venipuncture using
standard techniques.
• Handling: After collection, blood should be allowed to clot at room
temperature for a minimum of 30 minutes and not more than 60
minutes.
• Centrifugation: Centrifuge the blood at 1,300-1,800 x g for 10-15
minutes to obtain serum.
• Storage and Stability: Serum should be aliquoted into properly
labeled tubes and stored at 2-8°C if analyzed within 7 days of
collection. For long-term storage, specimens should be frozen at
-20°C or lower.

4. PROCEDURE
A) ELISA for INFLIXIMAB QUANTITATION
1. Preparation:
◦ Allow all reagents, controls, and patient samples to reach
room temperature (18-25°C) before use.
◦ Label all wells of the 96-well microplate correspondingly.
2. Assay Preparation:
◦ Pipette the specified volume of standards, quality controls,
and diluted patient serum samples to the assigned wells.
◦ Add a fixed volume of enzyme-conjugate reagent to each
well according to the ELISA kit instructions.
3. Incubation:
◦ Cover the microplate with a microplate cover and incubate
at the specified temperature and duration (as per kit
instructions).
4. Washing:
◦ Wash the wells according to the kit's washing protocol to
remove unbound components.
5. Substrate Addition:
◦ Add the designated amount of substrate solution to each
well. Incubate the plate at room temperature in the dark for
the specified duration.
6. Stopping the Reaction:
◦ Add stop solution to each well to terminate the reaction.
7. Reading and Quantitation:
◦ Measure the absorbance at the appropriate wavelength
using a microplate reader.
◦ Generate a standard curve and calculate the infliximab
concentration in the patient samples using the curve.
B) DETECTION OF ANTIBODIES TO INFLIXIMAB (ATI)
1. Preparation:
◦ Allow antibody detection reagents, controls, and patient
samples to reach room temperature (18-25°C).
2. Assay Preparation:
◦ Pipette standards, quality controls, and diluted patient
serum samples into their respective wells in a separate 96-
well microplate.
3. Enzyme-Conjugate Addition:
◦ Add enzyme-conjugate reagent to each well following the
specified volumes in the ATI detection kit.
4. Incubation:
◦ Cover the microplate and incubate at the temperature
specified in the ATI detection kit.
5. Washing:
◦ Wash the wells thoroughly to remove any unbound
antibodies/enzyme conjugates.
6. Substrate Addition:
◦ Add substrate solution to each well and incubate as per kit
instructions in the dark at room temperature.
7. Stopping the Reaction:
◦ Add stop solution to terminate the reaction.
8. Reading and Interpretation:
◦ Measure the optical density (OD) at the specified
wavelength using a microplate reader.
◦ Compare patient sample absorbance values against control
values to determine the presence or absence of ATI.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run quality control samples with every batch of patient samples.
Controls must be within the ranges specified by the kit
manufacturer.
• Document all quality control results on appropriate log sheets.
• If control results fall outside acceptable ranges, investigate and
take corrective actions before processing patient samples.
6. RESULT REPORTING
• Ensure data is reviewed and validated by trained personnel.
• Quantitative results of infliximab levels and qualitative presence of
ATI should be accurately entered into the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
• Interpret results in the context of established reference ranges
and patient's clinical information.
7. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to the specific ELISA kit's package insert for limitations
related to reagent use, assay performance, cross-reactivity, and
interfering substances.
8. REFERENCES
• Specific ELISA kit manufacturer instructions for infliximab
quantitation and ATI detection.
9. RECORD KEEPING AND DOCUMENTATION
• Document all steps, controls, calibrations, and results in
designated logbooks.
• Ensure all records are accurate, complete, and retained as per
standard laboratory protocols and regulatory requirements.
10. SAFETY
• Follow all laboratory safety protocols, including the use of PPE.
• Handle all biohazard materials, including serum samples and
used reagents, according to the appropriate biosafety and waste
disposal guidelines.
