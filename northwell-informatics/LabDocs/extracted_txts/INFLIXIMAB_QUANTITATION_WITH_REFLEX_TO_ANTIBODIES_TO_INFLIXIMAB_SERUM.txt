Standard Operating Procedure
(SOP) for INFLIXIMAB
QUANTITATION WITH REFLEX
TO ANTIBODIES TO
INFLIXIMAB, SERUM
1. PURPOSE:
To establish the proper procedure for the quantitation of Infliximab in
patient serum with reflex testing for antibodies to Infliximab. This
protocol ensures accurate and reliable results while maintaining
standard laboratory practices.
2. SCOPE:
This SOP applies to all personnel involved in the analytical phase of
performing Infliximab quantitation and subsequent reflex testing for
antibodies to Infliximab in the serum.
3. RESPONSIBILITY:
Laboratory technologists are responsible for performing the test
according to this SOP. The supervisor is responsible for the oversight
of testing and ensuring all personnel are trained and proficient.
4. EQUIPMENT, MATERIALS, AND REAGENTS:
Equipment:
• Centrifuge
• Incubator
• Analytical balance
• Serological pipettes
• Micropipettes
• Automated ELISA analyzer or other validated quantitation
equipment
Materials:
• 96-well microtiter plates (if performing ELISA manually)
• Test tubes/serum separation tubes
• Tips and tubes appropriate for pipetting
• Temperature monitoring devices
• Specimen storage containers
Reagents:
• Infliximab quantitation kit
• Antibody against Infliximab detection kit (for reflex testing)
• Standards and controls specific to Infliximab quantitation
• Washing buffers
• Substrate solutions
• Stop solution (if applicable)
5. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENT AND STORAGE:
Specimen Collection:
• Serum specimens should be collected in a red-top tube or serum
collection tube (without anticoagulants).
• Allow the blood to clot at room temperature for 30 minutes and
centrifuge at 3000 RPM for 10 minutes to separate serum.
• Transfer the serum to a clean, labeled tube.
• Specimen volumes should be 1-2 mL.
Specimen Storage:
• Store serum specimens at 2-8°C if analysis will be performed
within 48 hours.
• For longer storage, freeze the specimen at -20°C or colder.
• Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
6. PROCEDURE:
A) Infliximab Quantitation:
1. Set Up:
◦ Prepare reagents, standards, and controls as per the
manufacturer's instructions.
◦ Set up the quantitative assay according to the ELISA or
quantitation kit protocols.
2. Standard Curve:
◦ Generate the standard curve using serial dilutions of the
provided Infliximab standards.
◦ Ensure the standard curve is prepared fresh with each
assay run.
3. Sample Preparation:
◦ Thaw stored serum specimens if applicable.
◦ Dilute patient serum samples in the provided assay buffer if
necessary as per the kit instructions.
4. Assay Procedure:
◦ Add standards, controls, and diluted patient serum samples
to designated wells on the microtiter plate.
◦ Incubate according to the manufacturer's specified
conditions (temperature and time).
◦ Wash the plate using the washing buffer to remove unbound
substances.
◦ Add the detection antibody solution.
◦ Incubate and wash the plate again.
5. Development:
◦ Add the enzyme substrate solution.
◦ Incubate the plate to develop color.
◦ Add the stop solution to cease the reaction.
6. Measurement:
◦ Measure the optical density (OD) of each well using a
microplate reader at the specified wavelength.
◦ Validate the OD of standards and controls; if invalid, repeat
the assay.
7. Calculation:
◦ Calculate the concentration of Infliximab in patient samples
using the standard curve.
B) Reflex to Antibodies to Infliximab (if Infliximab is
undetectable or below therapeutic range):
1. Sample Preparation:
◦ Use the same serum sample or request a fresh sample if
necessary.
◦ Prepare the sample and controls according to the anti-
Infliximab detection kit instructions.
2. Assay Procedure:
◦ Set up the ELISA or alternative validated assay specific for
detecting antibodies to Infliximab.
◦ Process the patient serum samples, standards, and controls
according to the kit's protocol.
3. Incubation and Washing:
◦ Incubate the microtiter plate with samples and controls.
◦ Wash the plate as necessary to remove unbound
components.
4. Detection:
◦ Add detection reagents as per the kit instructions.
◦ Incubate to allow for the development of the detectable
signal.
5. Measurement:
◦ Measure the optical density or other signals as appropriate.
◦ Validate results against standard and control values.
6. Calculation:
◦ Determine the presence and titer of antibodies to Infliximab
in patient samples.
7. QUALITY CONTROL:
• Include positive and negative controls with each assay run.
• Run at least two levels of quality control materials alongside
patient specimens.
• Document and review control results to ensure they are within
acceptable ranges before releasing patient results.
• Follow corrective actions if QC results are outside the acceptable
ranges.
8. REPORTING RESULTS:
• Enter patient results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
• Verify results and ensure inclusion of applicable comments
regarding reflex testing.
• Report results according to site-specific guidelines.
9. REFERENCES:
Use the package inserts and technical manuals provided with the
Infliximab quantitation and antibody detection kits for detailed
procedural information.
10. REVISION HISTORY:
Maintain records of revisions to this SOP, noting changes and
updates.
