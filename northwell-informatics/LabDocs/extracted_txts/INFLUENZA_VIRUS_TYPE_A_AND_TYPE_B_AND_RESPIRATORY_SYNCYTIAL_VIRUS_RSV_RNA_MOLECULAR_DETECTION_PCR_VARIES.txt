Standard Operating Procedure
Title: Analytical Phase Protocol for Influenza Virus Type A and
Type B and Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) RNA, Molecular
Detection, PCR
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for performing molecular detection of
Influenza Virus Type A, Influenza Virus Type B, and Respiratory
Syncytial Virus (RSV) RNA using PCR.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all molecular diagnostic technologists at
the laboratory who are responsible for detecting Influenza Virus Type
A, Influenza Virus Type B, and RSV RNA from clinical specimens
using PCR methodology.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
Technologists are responsible for adhering to this procedure and for
accurate documentation of all results. Supervisors are responsible for
ensuring that technologists are trained and competent in this
procedure and for addressing any deficiencies in adherence.
4. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
• Specimen type: Nasopharyngeal swabs, throat swabs, or other
upper respiratory specimens.
• Storage: If specimens cannot be processed immediately, they
should be stored at 2-8°C and are stable for up to 72 hours.
• Transport: Specimens should be transported to the laboratory in a
sterile, leak-proof container with viral transport medium to prevent
RNA degradation.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• PCR instrument (e.g., Real-Time PCR System)
• Extraction kit (e.g., Qiagen RNA extraction kit)
• PCR reagents for Influenza Type A, Influenza Type B, and RSV
(e.g., specific primers and probes)
• Nuclease-free water
• Ethanol (96-100%)
• Disposable gloves and lab coats
• Microcentrifuge tubes
• PCR tubes/plate
• Vortex and centrifuge
6. PROCEDURE
A. RNA Extraction
1. Preparation: Wear disposable gloves and lab coat.
2. Specimen Processing: Vortex the specimen for 5 seconds.
3. Extraction:
◦ Follow the manufacturer's protocol for RNA extraction using
the designated extraction kit.
◦ Elute RNA in nuclease-free water.
B. PCR Setup
1. PCR Preparation:
◦ Prepare a master mix according to manufacturer
specifications for influenza type A, influenza type B, and
RSV primers and probes.
◦ Dispense the master mix into PCR tubes/plate.
2. Loading RNA Samples:
◦ Add extracted RNA into the PCR tubes/plate containing the
master mix.
◦ Include negative and positive controls.
C. PCR Amplification
1. PCR Running:
◦ Place the PCR tubes/plate into the Real-Time PCR
instrument.
◦ Set up the PCR machine according to the manufacturer’s
protocol for the specific assay.
◦ Start the run.
D. Post-PCR Analysis
1. Result Interpretation:
◦ Interpret the results according to the cycle threshold (Ct)
values provided by the instrument.
◦ Confirm positive results with strong amplification curves (low
Ct value) and negative controls showing no amplification.
E. Documentation and Reporting
1. Documentation:
◦ Record the results in the laboratory information system
(LIS).
2. Reporting:
◦ Verify and release results according to laboratory guidelines.
◦ Critical positive results must be immediately communicated
to the healthcare provider.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run positive and negative controls for each batch of specimens.
• Log control results for each run to ensure assay performance.
8. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Positive: Detected RNA for Influenza Virus Type A, Type B, or
RSV.
• Negative: No detectable RNA.
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to the manufacturer's insert for specific limitations related to
reagent sensitivity and specificity.
• False negatives can occur due to low viral load or specimen
degradation.
