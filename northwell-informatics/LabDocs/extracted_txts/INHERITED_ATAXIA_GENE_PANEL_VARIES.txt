Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Inherited Ataxia Gene Panel
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to detail the analytical phase procedures
for generating results from the Inherited Ataxia Gene Panel, which
includes the sequencing and interpretation of genes that are known
to be associated with inherited ataxias.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the trained genetic technologist/scientist to
perform the procedures as outlined in this document. The lab
supervisor is responsible for ensuring compliance and overseeing the
quality control and validation steps.
1. DEFINITION
Inherited ataxia refers to a group of genetic disorders that primarily
affect the cerebellum, causing coordination and balance issues. The
gene panel includes multiple genes known to be associated with
these disorders.
1. PROCEDURE
A. DNA Extraction and Quality Check i. Obtain the collected sample
(blood, saliva, or buccal swab). ii. Extract DNA using an appropriate
extraction kit, following manufacturer instructions. iii. Assess the
quality (purity and concentration) of extracted DNA using
spectrophotometry (e.g., Nanodrop) and gel electrophoresis.
B. Library Preparation i. Perform library preparation using a
commercially available gene panel kit designed for inherited ataxias.
ii. Follow the manufacturer's protocol for library preparation, including
fragmenting DNA, adapter ligation, and PCR amplification. iii.
Quantify and verify the library using methods such as Qubit
fluorometry and Bioanalyzer.
C. Sequencing i. Load prepared libraries onto the sequencing
platform (e.g., Illumina or Ion Torrent) as per manufacturer
instructions. ii. Run sequencing with appropriate parameters for
coverage and depth required (e.g., minimum of 50x coverage for
targeted regions).
D. Data Analysis i. Transfer raw sequence data to the bioinformatics
pipeline for analysis. ii. Perform primary analysis (base calling,
alignment to reference genome, and variant calling) using specified
software (e.g., BWA, GATK, DeepVariant). iii. Filter and classify
variants using established criteria (e.g., pathogenic, likely pathogenic,
uncertain significance, likely benign, benign).
E. Variant Interpretation i. Review variants in the context of inherited
ataxia using databases such as ClinVar, OMIM, HGMD, etc. ii.
Correlate findings with patient clinical history and phenotype. iii.
Consult with genetic counselors and/or clinical geneticists for final
interpretation and reporting.
F. Quality Control i. Run controls (positive and negative) alongside
patient samples to ensure fidelity of the test. ii. Perform internal
quality controls, such as replicate sequencing and consistency
checks. iii. Document all QC results and address any discrepancies
or failures with corrective actions.
G. Reporting Results i. Compile a comprehensive report including
details of variants detected, interpretation, classification, and
potential clinical implications. ii. Review and validate the report by a
senior geneticist or lab supervisor. iii. Ensure timely delivery of the
report to the referring clinician or genetic counselor.
H. Documentation and Record-Keeping i. Maintain accurate and
detailed records of all steps performed in the analytical phase,
including sample handling, library prep, sequencing data, analyses,
QC results, and reports. ii. Store raw sequence data and reports in
secure databases, as per institutional guidelines for data retention
and privacy.
1. REFERENCES
Provide references to all relevant protocols and manufacturer
guidelines, including: - Manufacturer's protocol for DNA extraction
and library preparation kits. - Sequencing platform manuals. -
Standard bioinformatics software documentation. - Guidelines from
genetic and clinical associations related to ataxias.
1. TRAINING AND COMPETENCY
Staff performing these procedures must be trained and competent in:
- Molecular biology techniques including DNA extraction and PCR. -
Sequencing technology and bioinformatics analysis. - Genetic variant
interpretation and reporting.
Documentation of training and competency must be maintained.
Completion of this protocol ensures accurate and reliable generation
of results for inherited ataxia gene panels, aiding clinical diagnosis
and management.
