STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES (SOP) FOR THE
ANALYTICAL PHASE OF INHERITED CONGENITAL
MYASTHENIC SYNDROME GENE PANEL TESTING
1. Purpose
To provide detailed guidelines for the analytical phase of generating
results for the Inherited Congenital Myasthenic Syndrome (CMS)
Gene Panel. These procedures ensure accurate, reliable, and
reproducible testing outcomes for patient samples.
2. Scope
This protocol applies to all laboratory technologists and personnel
conducting the CMS Gene Panel analysis in the designated
molecular diagnostics laboratory.
3. Responsibility
It is the responsibility of the laboratory technologist to adhere to these
protocols to ensure quality and accuracy. Supervisors are responsible
for oversight and validation of all processes. All staff must report any
deviations or deficiencies to their supervisors.
4. Definition
Inherited Congenital Myasthenic Syndrome (CMS) Gene Panel: A
targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) assay for the detection
of pathogenic variants in genes known to be associated with CMS.
5. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies
• NGS platform (e.g., Illumina or equivalent)
• DNA extraction kits
• Library preparation kits
• Custom or commercial CMS gene panel
• PCR reagents
• Gel electrophoresis apparatus
• Bioinformatics tools for sequence alignment and variant calling
• Quality control materials (positive and negative controls)
• Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS)
• Reference materials
• Sterile lab consumables (e.g., pipette tips, tubes)
• Molecular grade water
6. Procedure
6.1 DNA Extraction
1. Specimen:
◦ Blood: 3-5 ml in EDTA tube.
◦ Saliva: Collected using a commercial kit.
◦ Tissue: Fresh or frozen tissue samples.
2. Extraction:
◦ Follow the DNA extraction kit protocol.
◦ Quantify and assess the quality of DNA using Nanodrop and
Qubit.
6.2 Library Preparation
1. Fragmentation:
◦ Fragment the extracted DNA to the desired size range
(typically 150-300bp) using a suitable method or device.
2. End-Repair, A-Tailing, and Adapter Ligation:
◦ Perform end-repair and A-tailing according to the library
preparation kit protocol.
◦ Ligate sequencing adapters to the prepared DNA fragments.
3. Library Amplification:
◦ Amplify the adapter-ligated DNA fragments by PCR.
◦ Purify the PCR products and assess the library quality and
quantity.
6.3 Target Enrichment
1. Hybridization:
◦ Hybridize the prepared library to the CMS gene panel
probes according to the kit manufacturer’s protocol.
2. Capture:
◦ Capture the hybridized DNA using streptavidin beads.
3. Post-Capture Amplification:
◦ Perform post-capture amplification to enrich the target
regions.
6.4 Sequencing
1. Loading:
◦ Load the enriched libraries onto the sequencing platform.
2. Run:
◦ Execute the sequencing run following the manufacturer's
instructions.
6.5 Data Analysis
1. Base Calling and Alignment:
◦ Perform base calling using the sequencing platform
software.
◦ Align reads to the human reference genome (e.g., hg19 or
hg38) using appropriate bioinformatics tools.
2. Variant Calling:
◦ Identify variants using variant calling software.
◦ Annotate variants with known databases (e.g., ClinVar,
dbSNP).
6.6 Quality Control
1. QC Metrics:
◦ Evaluate sequencing quality metrics (e.g., Q30 scores,
coverage depth) to ensure they meet the predetermined
acceptance criteria.
◦ Include positive and negative controls in every batch of
samples to validate the run.
2. Review and Validation:
◦ Technologists review raw sequencing data, variant calls,
and QC metrics.
◦ Supervisors validate the results and address any anomalies.
7. Reporting Results
1. Interpretation:
◦ Interpret the clinical significance of detected variants with
respect to known pathogenicity and according to ACMG
guidelines.
2. Documentation:
◦ Document findings and interpretations in the LIMS.
◦ Prepare a comprehensive report summarizing the patient’s
results, including identified variants and their clinical
relevance.
3. Verification:
◦ A second technologist or supervisor reviews the final report
for accuracy and completeness.
4. Release:
◦ Finalize and release the report to the ordering physician
through the established secure channels.
8. Quality Assurance
1. Proficiency Testing:
◦ Participate in external proficiency testing programs to
ensure ongoing accuracy and reliability of testing.
2. Internal Audits:
◦ Regularly conduct internal audits to ensure adherence to all
SOPs and regulatory requirements.

encouraged to seek clarification when uncertain. Any procedure
updates or revisions must be approved by the laboratory director and
documented accordingly.
