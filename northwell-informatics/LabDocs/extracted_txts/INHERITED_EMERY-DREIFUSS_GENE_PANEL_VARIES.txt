Inherited Emery-Dreifuss Gene Panel SOP
1. Purpose: The purpose of this procedure is to outline the
analytical steps required for testing inherited Emery-Dreifuss
gene panel. This procedure ensures accurate and reliable
detection of variants associated with Emery-Dreifuss muscular
dystrophy.
Responsibility: It is the responsibility of the laboratory personnel to
follow this procedure precisely and to ensure the quality and integrity
of the test results.
1. Definitions: Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD) is an
inherited disorder characterized by muscle weakness,
contractures, and cardiac involvement. This panel includes, but
is not limited to, genes such as EMD, LMNA, FHL1, SYNE1,
and SYNE2.
2. Specimen Requirements and Stability:
◦ Specimen Type: Whole blood or extracted genomic DNA.
◦ Blood Specimens: Collected in EDTA (lavender top) tubes,
3–5 mL.
◦ DNA Specimens: Minimum of 10 µg of high-quality DNA with
an OD260/280 ratio of 1.8–2.0.
◦ Stability:
▪ Blood in EDTA can be stored at 4°C for up to 7 days.
▪ Extracted DNA should be frozen at -20°C and is stable
for several years.
3. Equipment, Reagents and Supplies:
◦ Thermocycler (PCR machine)
◦ Next-generation sequencing (NGS) system (e.g., Illumina
MiSeq, Ion Torrent)
◦ Quantification reagents (e.g., Qubit, Nanodrop)
◦ Library preparation kits
◦ Primer sets for target genes
◦ Reagents for PCR, such as dNTPs, Taq polymerase, buffers
◦ Bioinformatics software for data analysis (e.g., GATK,
VarSeq)
4. Procedure:
A. DNA Extraction If using whole blood, extract genomic DNA
using a validated DNA extraction kit.
◦ Conduct quality and quantity checks using Qubit or
Nanodrop spectrophotometer.
B. Library Preparation
◦ Prepare the library using the gene-specific primer sets
according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
◦ Quantify and assess the quality of the libraries using Qubit,
Nanodrop, and Bioanalyzer or TapeStation.
C. PCR Amplification
◦ Perform PCR amplification as prescribed in the library
preparation protocol.
◦ Ensure PCR products are of expected size by running on an
agarose gel.
D. Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS)
◦ Pool the libraries in equimolar concentrations.
◦ Load the pooled libraries onto the NGS platform following
the manufacturer’s instructions.
◦ Run the sequencing protocol appropriate for the platform in
use.
E. Data Analysis
◦ Transfer sequencing data to the bioinformatics system.
◦ Perform quality checks on raw sequence data to filter out
low-quality reads.
◦ Map reads to the human reference genome.
◦ Call variants using validated pipelines.
◦ Annotate variants and filter for potential pathogenic changes
in EMD, LMNA, FHL1, SYNE1, SYNE2.
5. Quality Control:
◦ Run positive and negative controls alongside patient
samples.
◦ Ensure the limit of detection (LOD) meets respective clinical
guidelines.
◦ Use well-characterized reference standards to confirm
assay performance.
◦ Evaluate run metrics to ensure data quality e.g., average
depth of coverage, percentage of target region covered at
the desired depth.
6. Reporting Results:
◦ Interpret variants based on ACMG guidelines.
◦ Confirm all pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants by
Sanger sequencing.
◦ Generate clinical reports, including interpretation of results
based on the latest literature and databases (e.g., ClinVar,
HGMD).
◦ Review all findings and QA checks before releasing results
to the clinician.
7. Reference Intervals: N/A – Results are qualitative, based on
the presence or absence of variants of clinical significance.
8. Method Limitations:
◦ Sensitivity of the detection may be impaired by low-quality
DNA.
◦ Some genomic regions may have low coverage or be
refractory to amplification.
◦ Variants in non-targeted regions will not be detected.

muscular dystrophy.
By adhering to this SOP, the laboratory ensures the production of
high-quality, reliable data essential for the proper diagnosis and
management of individuals with suspected Emery-Dreifuss muscular
dystrophy.
