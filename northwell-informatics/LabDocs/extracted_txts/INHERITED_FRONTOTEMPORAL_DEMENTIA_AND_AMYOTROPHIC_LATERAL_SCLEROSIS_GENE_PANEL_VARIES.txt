INHERITED FRONTOTEMPORAL DEMENTIA AND AMYOTROPHIC
LATERAL SCLEROSIS GENE PANEL ANALYTICAL PROCEDURE
1. PURPOSE This protocol describes the analytical procedures for
the Inherited Frontotemporal Dementia and Amyotrophic Lateral
Sclerosis Gene Panel testing to ensure accurate and reliable
results. This test encompasses next-generation sequencing
(NGS) to identify potential pathogenic variants in relevant
genes associated with inherited frontotemporal dementia (FTD)
and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).
Responsibility: Laboratory technologists, bioinformaticians, and
clinical staff are responsible for ensuring that all procedures are
followed as outlined. It is the responsibility of the laboratory
supervisor to ensure adherence to the protocol and address any
deficiencies.
1. SAMPLE PREPARATION A) DNA Extraction:
◦ Use a commercial DNA extraction kit or an automated
extraction system.
◦ Quantify and assess the purity of the extracted DNA using a
NanoDrop spectrophotometer and a Qubit fluorometer.
◦ DNA quality assessment: Ensure the A260/A280 ratio is
between 1.8 - 2.0, and DNA concentration is >20 ng/µL.
B) DNA Library Preparation:
• Use a validated library preparation kit specific for targeted NGS
panels.
• Follow manufacturer's instructions for DNA fragmentation, end
repair, adapter ligation, and amplification.
• Perform a quality check of the library using Agilent BioAnalyzer or
equivalent to ensure the appropriate size distribution.
1. SEQUENCING A) Instrumentation:
◦ Use Illumina NextSeq 550 or another validated NGS
instrument.
◦ Load prepared libraries onto the sequencing instrument and
follow the sequencer-specific protocol.
◦ Ensure all sequencings run metrics, including cluster
density, Q30 scores, and output yield, meet the
manufacturer’s specifications.
B) Sequencing Control:
• Include positive control samples (with known variants) and
negative control samples (no pathogenic variants) for each run.
• Ensure that the sequencing results of control samples are within
expected ranges.
1. BIOINFORMATICS ANALYSIS A) Data Processing:
◦ Demultiplexing of raw data files using Illumina bcl2fastq
software or equivalent.
◦ Alignment of reads to the human reference genome (hg19
or hg38) using BWA-MEM or equivalent.
◦ Variant Calling: Use validated variant calling software (e.g.,
GATK, FreeBayes) to identify single nucleotide variants
(SNVs) and indels.
B) Variant Annotation:
• Use tools such as ANNOVAR, VEP, or equivalent for functional
annotation of variants.
• Filter variants based on quality scores, read depth, and
annotation relevance.
1. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS A) Pathogenicity
Assessment:
◦ Classify variants according to ACMG guidelines into
categories (pathogenic, likely pathogenic, VUS, likely
benign, benign).
◦ Consider evidence from clinical databases (ClinVar, HGMD),
population databases (gnomAD), and literature review.
B) Reporting:
• Generate a clinical report that includes identified variants, their
classification, and interpretation.
• Include recommendations for follow-up testing or genetic
counseling as necessary.
• Ensure all analyzed results are reviewed and verified by at least
one clinical geneticist or a certified molecular biologist.
1. QUALITY CONTROL AND TROUBLESHOOTING A) Quality
Control:
◦ Participate in external quality assessment programs.
◦ Perform repeated runs for any sample that does not meet
quality criteria initially.
◦ Maintain records of all quality control measures, including
reagent lot numbers and instrument maintenance logs.
B) Troubleshooting:
• Address issues such as low library yields, sequencing run
failures, poor alignment rates, or unexpected control results.
• Document corrective actions taken in response to encountered
issues.
1. DOCUMENTATION AND REVIEW A) Documentation:
◦ Maintain comprehensive records, including sample tracking,
library preparation, sequencing metrics, variant annotations,
and final reports.
◦ Ensure confidentiality and secure storage of all patient data.
B) Review and Revision:
• Regularly review this SOP to incorporate new technologies or
improvements in methodologies.
• Revalidate the procedure and update documentation accordingly.
REFERENCES:
• ACMG guidelines for interpretation of sequence variants.
• Illumina platform-specific manuals and library preparation guides.
• Bioinformatics software user manuals and best practice
documentation.

Inherited Frontotemporal Dementia and Amyotrophic Lateral
Sclerosis Gene Panel testing, achieving high-quality and reliable
genetic testing results.
