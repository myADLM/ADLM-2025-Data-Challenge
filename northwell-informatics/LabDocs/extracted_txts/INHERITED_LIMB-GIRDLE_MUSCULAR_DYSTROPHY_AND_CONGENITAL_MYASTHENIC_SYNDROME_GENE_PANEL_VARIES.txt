Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) for Inherited Limb-Girdle
Muscular Dystrophy and Congenital Myasthenic Syndrome Gene
Panel Testing
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedures for generating
accurate and reproducible results in the analytical phase for the
Inherited Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy and Congenital
Myasthenic Syndrome Gene Panel. This SOP ensures all processes
are rigorously controlled to provide high-quality genetic testing
results.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of the laboratory technologists and molecular
biologists to adhere to this SOP, ensuring the integrity and accuracy
of the gene panel testing. Supervisors must verify compliance and
address any deviations from the standard procedure.
1. DEFINITION
Inherited Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy and Congenital
Myasthenic Syndrome Gene Panel Testing involves sequencing and
analysis of genes known to be associated with these conditions. The
test aims at identifying pathogenic variants that could explain the
clinical symptoms observed in patients.
1. PROCEDURE
Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies:
• Thermocyclers
• DNA Sequencers (e.g., Illumina NextSeq, MiSeq)
• Reagent Kits (e.g., amplification, library preparation kits)
• Quality Control Materials (positive and negative controls)
• Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) for data
tracking and reporting
Specimens:
Preferred/acceptable:
• 3 mL of whole blood collected in EDTA tubes and transported to
the laboratory within 48 hours of collection.
• Extracted DNA with a minimum concentration of 20 ng/µL, with a
total volume of at least 50 µL.
Unacceptable:
• Samples arriving beyond 48 hours of collection without
temperature-controlled transport.
• Specimens without collection date/time indicated.
• Samples visibly contaminated or degraded.
Procedure:
A. DNA Extraction:
1. Follow the specific protocol for DNA extraction from whole
blood using Qiagen DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit.
2. Quantify and assess the purity of DNA using Nanodrop
spectrophotometer and Qubit fluorometer.
3. Store DNA at -20°C until ready to use.
B. Library Preparation:
1. Normalize DNA concentration to 20 ng/µL.
2. Perform PCR amplification using designated primers for the
gene panel.
3. Clean up PCR products using AMPure XP beads.
4. Quantify and assess the quality of the library using Bioanalyzer
or TapeStation.
C. Sequencing:
1. Load libraries onto the sequencing platform following
manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Perform sequencing run, ensuring optimal cluster density and
quality metrics.
D. Data Analysis:
1. Generate FASTQ files from sequencing data.
2. Use bioinformatics pipelines like BWA (Burrows-Wheeler
Aligner) to align sequences to the reference genome.
3. Call variants using tools like GATK (Genome Analysis Toolkit).
4. Annotate variants and filter for potential pathogenic mutations
associated with the target conditions.
E. Quality Control:
1. Include positive and negative controls in each run.
2. Ensure sequencing data meets quality metrics (e.g., Q30 score,
coverage depth).
3. Review variant calls manually for concordance and potential
errors.
4. Document all QC steps and report any anomalies to the
supervisor.
Reporting Results:
1. Validate results in LIMS.
2. Interpret pathogenicity of detected variants based on ACMG
guidelines.
3. Generate a comprehensive report detailing identified mutations,
their potential clinical significance, and recommendations for
further action.
4. Review and sign-off by a certified geneticist before reporting to
clinicians.
Reference Intervals:
Refer to the established pathogenicity classifications and gene-
specific reference intervals as per ACMG guidelines.
Method Limitations:
All limitations are detailed in manufacturers' kits insert and
bioinformatics pipelines documentation. It is the responsibility of the
technologist to be aware of these when interpreting the results.
References:
Refer to the manufacturer's protocol for library preparation kits,
sequencing platform manuals, and ACMG guidelines for variant
classification.
This SOP ensures a systematic approach to generating reliable and
clinically relevant genetic data for Inherited Limb-Girdle Muscular
Dystrophy and Congenital Myasthenic Syndrome gene panels.
