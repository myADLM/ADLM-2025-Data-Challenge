Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Procedure for Inherited Motor and Sensory
Neuropathy Gene Panel Testing
1. PURPOSE
To accurately analyze and generate results for the Inherited Motor
and Sensory Neuropathy Gene Panel to identify genetic mutations
related to motor and sensory neuropathies.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of the lab technologists to follow this procedure
for the analysis of specimens for the Inherited Motor and Sensory
Neuropathy Gene Panel.
1. MATERIALS
• Whole blood or extracted DNA (minimum quantity based on kit
specifications).
• Reagents as per the gene panel sequencing kit (specific to
manufacturer).
• PCR thermocycler.
• Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) platform.
• Computer software for variant analysis and interpretation.
1. PROCEDURE
A) DNA Extraction and Quantification:
1. If starting with whole blood, perform DNA extraction using a
commercially available extraction kit. Follow the manufacturer's
instructions carefully.
2. Quantify extracted DNA using a spectrophotometer or
fluorometer to confirm the concentration and purity (A260/A280
ratio should be ~1.8).
B) PCR Amplification:
1. Prepare the master mix according to the gene panel kit
instructions, ensuring all reagents are thawed and kept on ice
as needed.
2. Aliquot samples and controls (positive and negative) into PCR
tubes or plates.
3. Run PCR cycles according to the kit protocol, ensuring the
proper thermal profile is used.
C) Library Preparation and Sequencing:
1. Pool PCR products and perform library preparation using the
manufacturer's protocol. This may involve steps such as end
repair, adapter ligation, and amplification.
2. Quantify the library using appropriate methods, such as qPCR
or bioanalyzer, to ensure the correct concentration for
sequencing.
3. Load libraries onto the NGS platform and start the sequencing
run according to the instrument's operating procedures.
D) Data Analysis:
1. Extract sequencing data using the sequencing platform
software.
2. Perform data quality checks, including read quality, coverage,
and alignment metrics.
3. Use gene panel-specific software or bioinformatics pipeline to
analyze variations and identify potential pathogenic mutations.
4. Generate a list of identified variants and annotate their potential
clinical significance using available databases (e.g., ClinVar,
HGMD).
E) Interpretation and Reporting Results:
1. Review identified variants and their annotations.
2. Interpret variants in the context of clinical symptoms and family
history.
3. Confirm the pathogenicity of variants and decide on their
potential impact on patient management.
4. Document results in the laboratory information system (LIS)
and verify results.
5. Generate a comprehensive report including identified variants,
their clinical significance, and recommendations for follow-up
testing if necessary.
6. Send the finalized report to the ordering physician.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
For DNA extraction, PCR, and sequencing, include positive and
negative controls to monitor for contamination and ensure procedural
integrity.
Regularly verify equipment performance as per manufacturer
instructions and perform routine calibration and maintenance.
Internal quality control must be performed on a regular basis to
ensure sequencing accuracy, including replicate runs and cross-
validation using known reference samples.
1. REFERENCES
Refer to the manufacturer’s protocols for DNA extraction, PCR,
library preparation, and sequencing.
Refer to databases such as ClinVar, HGMD, and other peer-reviewed
resources for variant interpretation.
Ensure compliance with local, state, and federal regulations including
the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA).
This SOP must be reviewed annually and revised as necessary to
incorporate technological advances or changes in procedures.
1. SAFETY AND INFECTION CONTROL
Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) including lab
coats, gloves, and eye protection.
Follow biosafety guidelines for handling specimens and chemicals.
Dispose of waste materials in accordance with the institution's waste
disposal policies.
By following these procedures, accurate and reliable results for the
Inherited Motor and Sensory Neuropathy Gene Panel can be
generated, contributing to the optimal clinical management of
patients.
