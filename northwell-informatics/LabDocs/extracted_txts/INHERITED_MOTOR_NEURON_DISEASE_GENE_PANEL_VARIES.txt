INHERITED MOTOR NEURON DISEASE GENE PANEL ANALYSIS
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this protocol is to outline the procedures for the
accurate and reliable analysis of the inherited motor neuron disease
gene panel. This analysis involves the identification of variants in
genes known to be associated with inherited motor neuron diseases
using next-generation sequencing (NGS). The results are primarily
used to aid in the diagnosis and clinical management of patients with
suspected inherited motor neuron disorders.
1. SPECIMEN
Acceptable Specimen Types:
• Whole blood collected in EDTA anticoagulant (preferred)
• Extracted DNA (from whole blood, saliva, or buccal swabs)
Unacceptable Specimen Types:
• Specimens collected in heparinized tubes
• Specimens exhibiting hemolysis or containing clotting
• DNA samples with low concentration or degraded integrity
Specimen Stability:
• Whole blood: stable for 7 days at 2-8°C
• Extracted DNA: stable for up to 1 year at -20°C
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
◦ DNA extraction kit (e.g., Qiagen QIAamp DNA Blood Mini
Kit)
◦ Quantification and quality assessment instruments (e.g.,
Qubit Fluorometer, NanoDrop)
◦ Library preparation kit for NGS (e.g., Illumina DNA Prep)
◦ NGS platform (e.g., Illumina MiSeq, NextSeq)
◦ Bioinformatics software for variant analysis (e.g.,
BaseSpace, Galaxy)
◦ Ensembl VEP for variant annotation
◦ Internal quality control materials for NGS validation
2. PROCEDURE
A. DNA Extraction
1. Extract genomic DNA from 200 µL of whole blood or saliva
using the Qiagen QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit according to
manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Quantify the extracted DNA using the Qubit Fluorometer. For
saliva samples, also assess purity using the NanoDrop
spectrophotometer.
3. Ensure DNA concentration is ≥50 ng/µL and within the volume
range of 5-50 µL.
4. Store extracted DNA at -20°C until library preparation.
B. Library Preparation
1. Prepare DNA libraries using the Illumina DNA Prep kit following
the manufacturer’s protocol.
2. Ensure the DNA input is within the range specified by the library
preparation protocol.
3. Utilize quality control metrics to assess the quality of the DNA
libraries (e.g., Fragment Analyzer, Bioanalyzer).
C. NGS Sequencing
1. Load the prepared libraries onto the Illumina sequencing
platform (MiSeq or NextSeq).
2. Follow platform-specific instructions for setup and run of the
sequencing operation.
3. Perform the sequencing run ensuring appropriate instrument
quality control.
D. Bioinformatics Analysis
1. Upload the sequencing data to the chosen bioinformatics
platform (e.g., BaseSpace, Galaxy).
2. Execute data alignment and variant calling pipelines specific to
the inherited motor neuron disease gene panel.
3. Perform variant annotation using tools such as Ensembl VEP.
E. Data Interpretation and Reporting
1. Review the identified variants in the context of known disease
associations and interpret their clinical significance.
2. Ensure the proper documentation and verification of all
significant variants.
3. Generate a detailed report including identified variants, their
clinical interpretation, and recommendations for further clinical
management.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
A. Procedural Quality Control
1. Include internal quality control (QC) samples with each run
(positive and negative control samples).
2. Document all QC results and ensure they fall within acceptable
ranges prior to proceeding with the analysis.
B. Analytical Quality Control
1. Review sequencing data quality metrics (e.g., cluster density,
Q30 scores) ensuring values are within platform-specific
acceptable ranges.
2. If quality control criteria are not met, investigate potential
issues, repeat the sequencing run if necessary, and document
all corrective actions taken.
3. REPORTING RESULTS
4. Confirm each report for accuracy and completeness before
issuance.
5. All results must be verified and validated by a qualified
technologist or laboratory director before reporting to the
clinician.
6. Follow site-specific guidelines for electronic and paper-based
result reporting.
