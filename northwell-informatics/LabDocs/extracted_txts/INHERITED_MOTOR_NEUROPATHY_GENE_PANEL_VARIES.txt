Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for INHERITED MOTOR NEUROPATHY (IMN)
GENE PANEL
1. PURPOSE
To outline the standard operating procedures for the analytical phase
of generating results for the Inherited Motor Neuropathy (IMN) Gene
Panel in order to ensure accurate, reproducible, and reliable results.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of laboratory technologists and supervisors to
follow and enforce this SOP. Proper adherence is necessary for
quality assurance and reliability of test results.
1. DEFINITION
The IMN Gene Panel tests for genetic mutations known to be
associated with inherited motor neuropathy, using next-generation
sequencing (NGS) techniques.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation
1. Verify Sample Integrity:
Ensure the received DNA samples meet the quality and quantity
standards required for NGS. If necessary, perform DNA extraction
using proper extraction kits as per manufacturer's protocol.
1. DNA Quantification and Quality Check:
Quantify DNA using a fluorometric method (e.g., Qubit) to ensure
accurate measurement. Assess the purity and integrity of DNA using
a spectrophotometer and gel electrophoresis, respectively.
B. Library Preparation
1. DNA Fragmentation:
Accurately fragment DNA to the desired size (e.g., 150-200 bp) using
a mechanical shearing method (e.g., sonicator). Ensure uniform
fragmentation by performing quality checks.
1. Adapter Ligation:
Ligate adapters to the ends of fragmented DNA using ligation
reagents as specified in the kit protocol. Purify and confirm adapter-
ligated products using bead-based purification methods and gel
electrophoresis.
1. PCR Amplification:
Perform PCR amplification of the ligation products using specific
primers provided in the kit, following the manufacturer's instructions.
Purify amplified products and assess their quality.
C. Sequencing
1. Sequencer Preparation:
Load the prepared DNA libraries onto the appropriate sequencing
platform (e.g., Illumina) following the manufacturer's guidelines.
Perform instrument quality checks and ensure proper calibration prior
to sequencing.
1. Sequencing Run:
Initiate the sequencing run as per the pre-set parameters specific to
the chosen gene panel. Monitor the sequencing performance and
parameters throughout the run.
D. Bioinformatic Analysis
1. Raw Data Processing:
Upload raw sequencing data to the bioinformatics server. Perform
quality control checks on raw sequencing reads using software tools
(e.g., FASTQC).
1. Alignment and Variant Calling:
Align sequencing reads to the human reference genome using
alignment tools (e.g., BWA-MEM). Call variants (SNVs and Indels)
using variant calling software (e.g., GATK).
1. Annotation and Filtering:
Annotate identified variants using annotation software (e.g.,
ANNOVAR) to understand the clinical relevance. Filter variants based
on quality metrics, allele frequencies, and predicted pathogenicity.
E. Interpretation and Reporting
1. Clinical Interpretation:
Review the filtered variants for clinical significance by comparing
them to known databases (e.g., ClinVar, HGMD). Use guidelines
(e.g., ACMG) for variant classification (pathogenic, likely pathogenic,
VUS, likely benign, benign).
1. Report Generation:
Prepare a comprehensive report summarizing the identified variants,
their clinical significance, and any recommended follow-up actions.
Ensure that the report is reviewed and signed off by a qualified
laboratory director or geneticist.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
2. Negative and Positive Controls:
Include both negative and positive controls in each run to ensure the
reliability and accuracy of the results. Analyze control results to
confirm the success of the sequencing and data analysis process.
1. Repeat Runs:
Any samples or runs that do not pass quality control checks should
be repeated to confirm results. Implement corrective actions for any
recurrent issues identified during the process.
1. DOCUMENTATION
Maintain a log of all processes and results, including sample
reception, DNA quantification, library preparation, sequencing run
details, and bioinformatics analysis run parameters. Keep records of
all reports generated and ensure they are stored securely and
confidentially.
