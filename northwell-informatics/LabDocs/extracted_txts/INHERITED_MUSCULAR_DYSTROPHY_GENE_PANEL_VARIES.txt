Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Title: Analytical Phase
Procedure: Generating Results for Inherited Muscular Dystrophy
Gene Panel (Various)
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedures for the accurate and efficient analysis of
samples for the Inherited Muscular Dystrophy Gene Panel. This
protocol ensures high-quality, reliable genetic test results and
includes instructions from DNA extraction to data analysis and result
generation.
Responsibility:
This procedure is the responsibility of all laboratory personnel trained
in molecular genetic testing.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
A. Acceptable Specimens
• 3-5 mL whole blood collected in EDTA (lavender top) tubes
• Saliva specimens collected in FDA-approved saliva collection kits
B. Unacceptable Specimens
• Hemolyzed blood samples
• Specimens not labeled with the patient's full name, date of birth,
and collection date
1. EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS
• DNA extraction kits (e.g., Qiagen Blood and Tissue Kit)
• PCR reagents and supplies
• Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) platform (e.g., Illumina
MiSeq)
• Bioinformatics software for sequence alignment and variant
calling
• Quality control materials
• LIMS (Laboratory Information Management System)
• Standard laboratory equipment: centrifuge, thermal cycler,
pipettes
1. PROCEDURE
A. DNA Extraction
1. Follow the specific manufacturer’s protocol for DNA extraction
using the selected kit.
2. Assess DNA concentration and purity using a
spectrophotometer (e.g., NanoDrop).
3. Store extracted DNA at -20°C until further processing.
B. Library Preparation
1. Quantify DNA using Qubit or an equivalent fluorometer.
2. Perform library preparation according to the NGS platform's
guidelines, ensuring correct adapter ligation and amplification.
3. Validate library construction via a Bioanalyzer or TapeStation to
check for correct size distribution and concentration.
C. PCR Amplification and Sequencing
1. Amplify target regions using appropriate primers for the
Inherited Muscular Dystrophy Gene Panel.
2. Clean up PCR products to remove primers and enzymes.
3. Pool the libraries as per protocol and load on the NGS platform.
4. Follow NGS platform-specific instructions for running the
sequencing.
D. Data Analysis
1. Transfer raw sequencing data to the bioinformatics server.
2. Use specialized software to align sequences to the reference
genome.
3. Perform variant calling to identify potential mutations within the
targeted genes.
4. Annotate variants using an up-to-date database to determine
clinical relevance.
E. Quality Control
1. Include positive and negative controls throughout the process.
2. Assess coverage metrics and ensure thresholds (e.g., 20x
coverage for all target regions) are met.
3. Verify reproducibility and accuracy of identified variants through
repeat testing.
4. REPORTING RESULTS
A. Interpretation and Validation
1. A qualified geneticist or molecular pathologist will review the
annotated variants and interpret their clinical significance.
2. Correlate identified variants with clinical presentation and family
history where applicable.
B. Report Generation
1. Generate a detailed report including patient information,
methodological details, detected variants, and clinical
interpretation.
2. Verify that the report meets all regulatory and accreditation
requirements.
C. Result Communication
1. Enter final results into the LIMS.
2. Ensure that results are communicated to the referring physician
through secure and appropriate channels.
3. Provide genetic counseling recommendations if clinically
pertinent.
