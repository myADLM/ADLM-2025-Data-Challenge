Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Generating Results for
Inherited Parkinson Disease Gene Panel
1. PURPOSE
To ensure accurate, consistent, and timely analysis and reporting of
genetic test results for the Inherited Parkinson Disease Gene Panel.
1. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all staff involved in the analytical phase of
generating results for the Inherited Parkinson Disease Gene Panel.
1. RESPONSIBILITIES
• Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing
the analytical procedures according to this SOP.
• Supervisors are responsible for ensuring adherence to the
procedures and addressing any deviations from the protocol.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Source: Peripheral blood or saliva sample.
• Volume: 3-5 mL for blood; full saliva collection kit.
• Storage: Room temperature for immediate processing; 4°C if
processing is delayed (up to 72 hours).
• Unacceptable Specimens: Hemolyzed blood samples, insufficient
quantity, or samples received beyond 72 hours post-collection
without refrigeration.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• DNA extraction kits (e.g., Qiagen QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit)
• PCR reaction kits and reagents
• Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) platform (e.g., Illumina
MiSeq)
• Data analysis software (e.g., Bioinformatics pipelines, Variant
Interpretation software)
• Quality control materials
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
1. PROCEDURE
A) DNA Extraction
1. Label all samples and associated documentation clearly.
2. Proceed with DNA extraction using the specified kit according
to the manufacturer’s instructions.
3. Quantify and assess the DNA purity using a spectrophotometer
(e.g., NanoDrop).
4. Document DNA concentration and purity ratios in the laboratory
information system (LIS).
B) Library Preparation and Sequencing
1. Prepare DNA libraries following the library preparation kit
protocol.
2. Verify library concentration and quality using a fluorometer and
agarose gel electrophoresis.
3. Load the libraries onto the NGS platform for sequencing as per
the platform's user manual.
C) Data Analysis
1. Sequence data will be automatically transferred to the
bioinformatics pipeline.
2. Run the initial quality control checks on raw sequence data
(e.g., FASTQ files).
3. Perform alignment of sequences to the human genome
reference (e.g., hg19 or hg38).
4. Identify variants using variant calling software (e.g., GATK).
5. Perform secondary analyses including variant annotation,
filtering, and prioritization.
6. Undertake manual review and interpretation of variants using
clinical databases and literature.
7. Validate identified pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants using
Sanger sequencing if necessary.
D) Quality Control and Validation
1. Include positive and negative controls in all experiments.
2. Verify that all control results meet the acceptance criteria before
releasing patient results.
3. Perform inter-laboratory comparisons and participate in
proficiency testing regularly.
4. Document all QC results and any corrective actions taken.
5. REPORTING RESULTS
• Verify all variant interpretations through consensus discussion
within the molecular genetics team.
• Prepare a comprehensive report, including relevant findings and
their clinical significance.
• Include limitations of the test and recommendations for familial
testing if applicable.
• Transmit results to the LIS and ensure they are reviewed and
authenticated by a qualified geneticist.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Sensitivity and specificity are influenced by the quality of samples
and read depth.
• Some regions of the genome may have lower coverage, affecting
variant detection.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s manuals for DNA extraction and library
preparation kits.
• Platform-specific user guides for sequencing instruments.
• Databases such as ClinVar, OMIM for variant interpretation.
1. REVIEW
• This SOP will be reviewed annually and updated as necessary to
reflect technological advancements and regulatory guidelines.
1. REVISION HISTORY
• Document all changes including the date of revision, nature of the
change, and the responsible individual.
By following this SOP, laboratory staff will ensure the quality and
reliability of the genetic testing process for Inherited Parkinson
Disease Gene Panel, leading to appropriate clinical interpretations
and actions.
