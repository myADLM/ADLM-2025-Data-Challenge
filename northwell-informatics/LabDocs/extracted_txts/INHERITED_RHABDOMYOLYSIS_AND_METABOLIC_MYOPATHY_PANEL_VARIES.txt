Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for INHERITED
RHABDOMYOLYSIS AND METABOLIC MYOPATHY PANEL,
VARIES:
1. PURPOSE
To establish a standard procedure for the analytical phase of
generating results for the Inherited Rhabdomyolysis and Metabolic
Myopathy Panel. This protocol ensures consistent, accurate, and
reliable results essential for diagnosing and managing inherited
muscle disorders.
Responsibility:
• Designated staff must follow this SOP for processing and
analyzing specimens.
• Staff must ensure procedural adherence, including any corrective
actions that may be required.
1. DEFINITION
The Inherited Rhabdomyolysis and Metabolic Myopathy Panel
includes a comprehensive set of genetic tests designed to identify
mutations associated with muscle disorders. Analytical instruments
include PCR machines, sequencers, and other molecular diagnostic
tools.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Pre-analytical Preparation
1. Specimens:
• Ensure specimens meet appropriate criteria (e.g., blood, muscle
biopsy).
• Confirm all specimens are correctly labeled with patient
information and accession numbers.
• Store samples at the appropriate temperature until analysis.
1. Reagents and Supplies:
• Ensure all reagents, primers, and probes are within expiration
date.
• Store and handle reagents according to manufacturer's
instructions.
B. DNA Extraction
1. Use an approved DNA extraction kit to isolate DNA from the
specimen.
2. Quantify and assess the purity of the extracted DNA using a
spectrophotometer.
3. Document the DNA concentration and purity ratios in the
analytical log.
C. PCR Amplification
1. Prepare the PCR master mix on ice, ensuring the inclusion of
all necessary components (buffer, dNTPs, Taq polymerase,
primers, and extracted DNA).
2. Set up PCR reactions in accordance with validated protocols for
each gene in the panel.
3. Use a thermal cycler with a pre-set program for the
amplification.
D. Gel Electrophoresis (if applicable)
1. Prepare an agarose gel and load PCR products.
2. Run electrophoresis at an appropriate voltage until sufficient
separation is achieved.
3. Visualize DNA bands using a UV transilluminator and document
results.
E. Next-Generation Sequencing
1. Library Preparation:
◦ Follow the library preparation protocol approved for the
panel.
◦ Assess the quality and quantity of prepared libraries using a
fluorometer and electrophoresis.
2. Sequencing:
◦ Load libraries onto a sequencing instrument following the
manufacturer's protocol.
◦ Monitor the sequencing run for successful completion.
F. Data Analysis
1. Transfer raw sequencing data to the bioinformatics platform.
2. Use validated software to align sequences against a reference
genome and identify variants.
3. Filter and prioritize variants according to established criteria.
4. Annotate variants using databases and literature to determine
clinical significance.
G. Quality Control
1. Include positive and negative controls at each step of the
analytical process.
2. Verify the accuracy and consistency of results by comparing
duplicates.
3. Document any deviations from the SOP or unexpected results
and investigate the root cause.
4. Implement corrective actions and revalidate steps if necessary.
H. Result Generation and Reporting
1. Prepare a comprehensive report summarizing the identified
variations and their clinical relevance.
2. Ensure the report is reviewed and signed off by a qualified
clinical geneticist or pathologist.
3. Document the final report in the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
4. POST-ANALYTICAL PHASE
A. Result Verification and Validation
1. Double-check all entered data in the LIS for transcription errors.
2. Ensure all critical results are communicated to the requesting
clinician promptly.
B. Storage and Archiving
1. Store residual specimens and extracted DNA according to
laboratory protocol.
2. Archive all documentation and electronic data for future
reference or reanalysis.
3. REFERENCES
Include references to relevant guidelines, manufacturer’s manuals,
and peer-reviewed literature that support the procedures outlined in
this SOP.
1. DOCUMENTATION Maintain records of:
• Specimen receipt and conditions
• DNA extraction metrics
• PCR reaction conditions and results
• Sequencing run conditions and outcomes
• Data analysis steps and findings
• Quality control results and corrective actions
1. TROUBLESHOOTING
Address common issues that may arise during any phase of the
protocol and provide solutions. Document all troubleshooting steps
taken to ensure transparency and continuous improvement.
By adhering to this SOP, we ensure that results for the Inherited
Rhabdomyolysis and Metabolic Myopathy Panel are generated with a
high level of accuracy and reliability, contributing valuable information
for patient management and care.
