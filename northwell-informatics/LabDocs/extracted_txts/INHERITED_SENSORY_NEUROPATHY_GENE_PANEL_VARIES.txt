Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for INHERITED SENSORY NEUROPATHY
GENE PANEL, VARIES
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this protocol is to provide detailed instructions for the
analytical phase of generating results for the Inherited Sensory
Neuropathy Gene Panel. This ensures the accuracy, reliability, and
consistency of data interpretation and reporting of genetic variants
associated with inherited sensory neuropathies.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel involved in the analytical
process for the Inherited Sensory Neuropathy Gene Panel within the
molecular genetics laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Technologists: Responsible for performing the analytical
procedures as outlined, including DNA extraction, quantification,
library preparation, sequencing, data analysis, and variant
interpretation.
• Supervisors: Ensure that all steps are performed correctly and
that any deviations are documented and addressed promptly.
Provide guidance for troubleshooting and confirm final results
before reporting.
4. DEFINITIONS
• Inherited Sensory Neuropathy: A group of genetic disorders
characterized by sensory nerve damage leading to pain, tingling,
or numbness, predominantly in the hands and feet.
• Gene Panel: A targeted set of genes known to be associated with
a particular condition, in this case, inherited sensory
neuropathies.
5. PROCEDURE
A. DNA EXTRACTUON AND QUANTIFICATION
1. Sample Preparation:
◦ Retrieve accessioned DNA samples from storage.
◦ Ensure samples are correctly labeled and include necessary
documentation.
2. DNA Extraction:
◦ Perform DNA extraction using standard protocols such as
phenol-chloroform extraction or commercially available kits
(e.g., QIAamp DNA Mini Kit).
◦ Follow kit instructions or SOPs for extraction methods.
3. DNA Quantification and Quality Assessment:
◦ Measure DNA concentration using a fluorometer (Qubit) or
spectrophotometer (Nanodrop).
◦ Assess the purity of DNA by calculating the A260/A280 ratio.
Acceptable range: 1.8-2.0.
◦ Evaluate DNA integrity through gel electrophoresis.
B. LIBRARY PREPARATION AND SEQUENCING
1. Library Preparation:
◦ Use targeted gene enrichment methods (e.g., hybrid capture
or amplicon-based approach) specific to the inherited
sensory neuropathy gene panel.
◦ Follow manufacturer’s instructions or standard protocols for
library preparation kits (e.g., Illumina TruSeq Custom
Amplicon Kit).
2. Library Quantification:
◦ Quantify prepared libraries using qPCR or fluorometric
methods.
◦ Pool libraries for sequencing according to concentration and
target coverage requirements.
3. Sequencing:
◦ Load pooled libraries onto the sequencer following the
manufacturer’s protocol.
◦ Set up run parameters (e.g., read length, indexing) specific
to the sequencing platform used (e.g., Illumina MiSeq,
NextSeq).
C. DATA ANALYSIS
1. Raw Data Processing:
◦ Transfer sequencing data to designated bioinformatics
workstations or servers.
◦ Perform initial quality checks using FASTQC or similar
software.
◦ Trim low-quality bases and adapters using tools such as
Trimmomatic or Cutadapt.
2. Alignment and Variant Calling:
◦ Align reads to the human reference genome (e.g., GRCh37/
hg19 or GRCh38) using a suitable aligner (e.g., BWA,
Bowtie2).
◦ Perform variant calling using software such as GATK,
FreeBayes, or SAMtools.
◦ Filter and annotate variants using tools like VEP, ANNOVAR,
or SnpEff.
3. Quality Control and Confirmation:
◦ Review variant quality metrics (e.g., read depth, variant
allele frequency) and filter out low-quality variants.
◦ Confirm potentially pathogenic variants with Sanger
sequencing or other orthogonal methods if necessary.
D. VARIANT INTERPRETATION AND REPORTING
1. Variant Interpretation:
◦ Classify variants according to guidelines from ACMG (The
American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics).
◦ Cross-reference each variant with literature, databases
(e.g., ClinVar, HGMD), and in-house data for clinical
significance.
2. Report Generation:
◦ Compile a comprehensive report including patient
information, method summary, identified variants,
interpretation, and clinical recommendations.
◦ Review and sign off the final report by a qualified clinical
geneticist or laboratory director.
3. Results Validation:
◦ Ensure all results meet established validation criteria.
◦ Document any deviations or out-of-specification results and
implement corrective actions.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform standard quality control (QC) measures at each step,
including DNA extraction efficiency, library preparation,
sequencing run quality, and data analysis metrics.
• Regularly calibrate and maintain equipment as per manufacturer's
guidelines.
• Satisfy proficiency testing requirements as per CLIA regulations
and participate in external quality assessment schemes.
7. RECORD KEEPING AND DOCUMENTATION
• Maintain comprehensive logs for sample handling, reagents,
instrumentation, and analytical procedures.
• Store raw data, intermediate files, and final reports securely and
ensure backup.
• Document troubleshooting, corrective actions, and quality control
outcomes.
8. REFERENCES
• ACMG Standards and Guidelines for Variant Interpretation.
• Relevant operator manuals for DNA extraction kits, library
preparation kits, sequencers, and bioinformatics tools.
• In-house policy documents and previous validated protocols for
genetic testing.
This protocol ensures reliable and accurate detection and
interpretation of genetic variants associated with inherited sensory
neuropathies. Proper adherence to each step and thorough
documentation will maintain the integrity and quality of the test
results.
