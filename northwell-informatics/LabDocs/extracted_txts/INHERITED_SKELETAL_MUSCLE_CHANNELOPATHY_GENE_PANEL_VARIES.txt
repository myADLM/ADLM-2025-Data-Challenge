Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for INHERITED SKELETAL MUSCLE
CHANNELOPATHY GENE PANEL, VARIES
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to define the standardized methods for
analyzing specimens and generating results for the INHERITED
SKELETAL MUSCLE CHANNELOPATHY GENE PANEL, VARIES.
This SOP ensures accuracy, reproducibility, and reliability of gene
panel testing results, which are critical for the diagnosis of inherited
skeletal muscle channelopathies.
Responsibility:
Designated personnel are responsible for performing genetic analysis
following the specified procedures and documenting all relevant data.
Supervisors and quality control personnel are responsible for
reviewing the analysis process and ensuring compliance with
established protocols.
1. DEFINITION
INHERITED SKELETAL MUSCLE CHANNELOPATHY GENE
PANEL, VARIES typically includes sequencing and analysis of gene
variants related to ion channels in skeletal muscles known to be
associated with clinical manifestations such as periodic paralysis,
myotonia, and other related disorders.
1. PROCEDURE
A) Preparation
Before beginning the analysis, ensure that all necessary equipment,
reagents, and supplies are properly calibrated, validated, and
maintained according to laboratory standards.
Confirm that specimens meet the acceptance criteria and have been
properly accessioned and logged into the laboratory information
system (LIS).
Ensure that all personnel are familiar with relevant gene panel
protocols and have reviewed the latest guidelines and manufacturer
instructions.
B) DNA Extraction
Perform DNA extraction from collected specimens using approved
methods and kits. Follow detailed manufacturer instructions and
ensure DNA concentration and purity meet specified criteria (e.g.,
A260/A280 ratio).
Record extraction details including sample ID, date, time, and
personnel initials in the appropriate log.
C) Library Preparation
Prepare DNA library using standardized protocols suitable for gene
panel sequencing. Include necessary steps such as fragmentation,
end repair, adapter ligation, and quantification.
Document all preparation steps and ensure quality controls (e.g.,
Agilent Bioanalyzer) are performed to confirm library integrity.
D) Sequencing
Load prepared libraries onto the sequencer following manufacturer
instructions for the specific platform (e.g., Illumina, Ion Torrent).
Monitor sequencing run for any issues and document relevant
information including sequencing metrics (e.g., read depth, quality
scores).
Generate raw sequencing data and store securely according to
laboratory data management policies.
E) Data Analysis
Analyze sequencing data using validated bioinformatics tools and
pipelines. Ensure alignment of sequences to the reference genome
and identification of variants within target genes.
Implement variant calling algorithms and annotate identified variants
for potential pathogenicity.
Confirm variants using secondary analysis tools and cross-reference
with known databases (e.g., ClinVar, HGMD).
F) Interpretation
Interpret identified variants in context of the patient's clinical history
and phenotype. Assess variants for clinical significance using
guidelines from organizations such as ACMG.
Generate a clinical report that includes identified variants,
interpretation, and recommended follow-up actions.
G) Quality Control
Perform quality control checks throughout the analysis process to
ensure data accuracy and reproducibility. This includes:
• Verification of DNA extraction yield and purity.
• Confirmation of library preparation quality.
• Review of sequencing run metrics.
• Assessment of variant calling accuracy.
• Validation of final report by a second reviewer.
Document all quality control activities and address any deviations
from standard protocols.
H) Reporting
Submit the final interpreted report to the LIS for verification by the
designated geneticist or laboratory director.
Ensure results are reported in accordance with site-specific
guidelines and are communicated to the ordered clinician within the
specified turnaround time.
Detailed instructions for reporting can be found in the laboratory’s
reporting guideline document.
1. REFERENCES
Refer to manufacturer instructions for specific instrumentation used
for DNA extraction, library preparation, and sequencing.
Utilize gene panel-specific guidelines and standard references from
professional organizations such as ACMG, ClinVar, and HGMD.
References to literature on variant interpretation and clinical
significance.
1. DOCUMENTATION
All activities related to the analysis and generation of results for the
INHERITED SKELETAL MUSCLE CHANNELOPATHY GENE
PANEL, VARIES should be thoroughly documented to ensure
traceability and compliance with regulatory standards.
Regular audits should be conducted to ensure protocol adherence
and continuous process improvement.
