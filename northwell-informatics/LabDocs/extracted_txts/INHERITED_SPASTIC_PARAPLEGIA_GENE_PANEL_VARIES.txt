STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP)
Title: Analytical Phase of Generating Results for Inherited
Spastic Paraplegia Gene Panel
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedures for the analysis and reporting of the
Inherited Spastic Paraplegia (HSP) Gene Panel, ensuring accuracy,
validity, and compliance with CLIA regulations.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to the analytical phase of testing for the HSP gene
panel once the specimen has been collected, received, and
accessioned. It includes DNA extraction, library preparation,
sequencing, data analysis, and result interpretation.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Laboratory Director: Ensures overall compliance with SOP.
• Technical Supervisor: Responsible for overseeing the analysis
and ensuring quality control measures are maintained.
• Medical Laboratory Scientists: Perform the analysis according
to this SOP and document each step.
• Bioinformaticians: Analyze sequencing data and generate the
initial report for review.
4. DEFINITIONS
• HSP Gene Panel: A set of genes commonly associated with
Inherited Spastic Paraplegia.
• PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction): A technique used to amplify
DNA.
• NGS (Next Generation Sequencing): A method to sequence
DNA rapidly and accurately.
• QC (Quality Control): Procedures to detect and correct errors in
the analytical phase.
5. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Equipment: Thermocycler, NGS platform (e.g., Illumina MiSeq),
centrifuges, nanopure water system, pipettes, gel electrophoresis
apparatus, spectrophotometer.
• Reagents: DNA extraction kits, PCR reaction components, NGS
library prep kits, sequencing reagents.
• Supplies: Sterile tubes, pipette tips with filters, gloves, lab coats,
DNA-free benches.
6. PROCEDURE
A) DNA EXTRACTION
1. Sample Preparation:
◦ Ensure that specimens are kept at the appropriate
temperature to ensure DNA integrity (e.g., 4-8°C).
◦ Use a validated DNA extraction kit according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
2. DNA Extraction:
◦ Aliquot the appropriate volume of specimen into sterile
tubes.
◦ Add lysis buffer and incubate as required.
◦ Mix the sample with binding buffer and use silica columns or
magnetic beads to isolate DNA.
◦ Wash the bound DNA and elute in an appropriate buffer.
◦ Measure DNA concentration and purity using a
spectrophotometer or fluorometer.
B) LIBRARY PREPARATION
1. Fragmentation:
◦ Fragment the DNA to the desired size using a mechanical
shearing device or enzymatic method.
2. Adaptor Ligation:
◦ Prepare the reaction mix with fragmented DNA, adaptors,
and ligase enzyme.
◦ Incubate the mixture according to the manufacturer's
protocol.
3. PCR Amplification:
◦ Amplify the adaptor-ligated DNA using specific primers and
a thermocycler.
◦ Cleanup the PCR product to remove any unused primers
and nucleotides.
4. Quality Control:
◦ Check the size distribution using agarose gel
electrophoresis or Bioanalyzer.
◦ Quantify the DNA library using a fluorometer.
C) SEQUENCING
1. Loading the Sequencer:
◦ Prepare the sequencing flow cell according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
◦ Load the prepared libraries onto the sequencer.
◦ Execute the sequencing run following standard operating
protocols of the NGS platform.
2. Monitoring the Run:
◦ Monitor the sequencing run for any errors or issues.
◦ Ensure that all required controls are within acceptable limits.
D) DATA ANALYSIS
1. Initial Data Processing:
◦ Import raw sequencing data into the bioinformatics pipeline.
◦ Perform read alignment to reference genome.
◦ Identify variants using variant calling algorithms.
2. Post-Processing:
◦ Filter variants based on established criteria (e.g., quality
score, read depth).
◦ Annotate variants with known databases to determine
clinical relevance.
E) REPORTING
1. Result Interpretation:
◦ A designated clinical geneticist reviews the annotated
variants.
◦ Correlate findings with clinical presentation and family
history.
2. Generating the Final Report:
◦ Summarize significant findings, including pathogenic, likely
pathogenic, variants of uncertain significance, and benign
variants.
◦ The report should include the interpretation of variants in the
context of the patient's phenotype.
3. Quality Control Review:
◦ Ensure that all quality control measures for library prep,
sequencing, and data analysis are met.
◦ Document all findings and QC measures in the laboratory
information system (LIS).
4. Delivering Results:
◦ The final report should be reviewed and signed by a
qualified laboratory director.
◦ Transmit the result to the ordering healthcare provider
securely and update in both LIS and Electronic Medical
Record (EMR) if applicable.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Regularly calibrate and maintain all equipment used in the
analytical process.
• Utilize positive and negative controls at each step of the process.
• Document all reagent lot numbers and expiration dates.
• Perform proficiency testing as recommended by accrediting
agencies.
8. TROUBLESHOOTING
• Low DNA Yield: Re-extract the DNA using an alternative method
or additional sample if necessary.
• Library Prep Issues: Repeat library prep and ensure all reagents
are mixed thoroughly and incubations are performed accurately.
• Sequencing Failures: Restart sequencing with new reagents
and flow cells, if needed.
• Bioinformatics Pipeline Errors: Contact IT support for resolution
and ensure all software is updated to the latest version.
