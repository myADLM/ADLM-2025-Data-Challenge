Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Generating Results for
Inhibin A and B, Tumor Marker, Serum
1. PURPOSE
To provide standardized procedures for generating accurate and
reliable results for Inhibin A and B, tumor markers in serum
specimens. This ensures consistency, reliability, and compliance with
regulatory standards in the analytical phase of testing.
Responsibility:
Designated technologists and laboratory personnel are responsible
for conducting and documenting the procedures outlined in this SOP.
Supervisors must ensure adherence to the protocol and address any
discrepancies or issues.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen Type: Serum Preferred Specimen: 3-5 mL blood collected
in a serum separator tube (SST) Specimen Collection:
• Blood should be drawn using standard venipuncture techniques.
• Allow the blood to clot for 30 minutes at room temperature.
• Centrifuge at 1500-2000 g for 10-15 minutes to separate the
serum. Specimen Storage:
• Freshly collected specimens should be stored at 2-8°C if testing
will occur within 48 hours.
• For longer storage, freeze specimens at -20°C or lower.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Hemolyzed samples
• Specimens collected in containers other than SST
• Specimens with visible contamination or improper labeling
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit for Inhibin A and
B
• Calibrators and controls specific for Inhibin A and B
• Automated ELISA reader
• Micropipettes and disposable tips
• Plate washer
• Centrifuge
• Standard laboratory glassware and lab equipment
1. PROCEDURE
A) Sample Preparation:
• Ensure the serum specimens are thawed completely and mixed
thoroughly by gentle inversion if stored frozen.
• Aliquot desired volume (typically 50-100 µL) per well on the ELISA
microplate according to the ELISA kit instructions.
B) Assay Setup:
• Prepare all reagents, including buffers, standards, and controls,
as outlined in the ELISA kit insert.
• Add standards, controls, and serum samples to the designated
wells on the microplate.
• Follow the manufacturer's instructions for all incubation steps,
including temperature and timing.
C) ELISA Assay Execution:
• Add the detection antibody to each well.
• Incubate for the specified time at the recommended temperature.
• Wash the wells thoroughly using an automated plate washer or
manually with the provided washing buffer.
• Add substrate solution and incubate as directed until the color
change is observed.
• Stop the reaction by adding the stop solution as specified by the
kit instructions.
D) Reading and Analysis:
• Measure the optical density (OD) using an automated ELISA
reader set to the correct wavelength as per the kit instructions.
• Generate a standard curve using the OD values from the
standards.
• Calculate the concentration of Inhibin A and B in the serum
samples using the standard curve.
E) Quality Control:
• Run quality control samples (both positive and negative controls)
with each batch of samples to verify the accuracy and reliability of
the assay.
• Ensure that the measured values fall within the acceptable range
as defined by the kit manufacturer.
• Document all QC results and take corrective actions if necessary
(e.g., repeating the assay).
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results are reviewed and verified by the technologist.
• Ensure that all calculations are correct and data align with
expected values.
• Report results in a standardized format as per laboratory
guidelines.
• Critical results should be communicated immediately to the
relevant medical personnel.

1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the ELISA kit insert for specific limitations related to
individual reagents, potential interferences, and optimal sample
handling conditions.
Approval and Review: This SOP will be reviewed annually and
approved by [Designated Authority] before implementation. All
changes will be documented and communicated to relevant
stakeholders.
Document Control: This SOP is a controlled document and must not
be copied or reproduced without permission from the laboratory
supervisor.
