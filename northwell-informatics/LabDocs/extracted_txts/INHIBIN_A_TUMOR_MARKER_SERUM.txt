Protocol for the Analytical Phase of Generating Results for
INHIBIN A, TUMOR MARKER, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
To provide a detailed and standardized protocol for the analysis
of INHIBIN A, a serum tumor marker, ensuring accurate and
reliable test results for clinical purposes.
2. SCOPE
This protocol applies to the analytical phase of testing INHIBIN
A, including preparation, calibration, sample analysis, quality
control, and result reporting.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
• Medical Laboratory Scientist: Ensures that all steps are
followed per this protocol from the preparation of reagents to the
generation of results.
• Laboratory Supervisor: Monitors adherence to the protocol and
approves results for clinical release.
1. EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS
• Automated Immunoassay Analyzer (e.g., Roche Cobas e411)
• Calibrators: INHIBIN A Calibrator
• Quality Control Materials: Low, Medium, High controls specific for
INHIBIN A
• Reagents: INHIBIN A assay specific reagents
• Micropipettes and pipette tips
• Serum sample collection tubes (SST, red top tubes)
• Laboratory Information System (LIS) for result recording and
verification
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
• Specimen Type: Serum
• Collection: Standard venipuncture technique
• Volume Required: Minimum 500 µL
• Stability: Stable for 48 hours at 2-8°C. For long-term storage,
freeze at -20°C or colder.
1. PROCEDURE
Sample Preparation
a) Allow the serum specimen to clot completely at room
temperature before centrifugation. b) Centrifuge the specimen
at 1500-2000 x g for 10 minutes to ensure a clear, hemolysis-
free serum. c) Aliquot the serum into a clean, appropriately
labeled secondary tube.
Calibration
a) Prepare the INHIBIN A calibrators according to the manufacturer's
instructions. b) Run the calibrators on the immunoassay analyzer to
calibrate the instrument. c) Verify that the calibration curve meets
acceptable criteria before proceeding with sample analysis.
Quality Control
a) Run quality control materials (low, medium, and high controls) with
each batch of patient samples. b) Document and verify control results
in the QC log. c) Ensure that QC results fall within the manufacturer’s
specified ranges. If out of range, troubleshoot, take corrective
actions, and recalibrate if necessary.
Sample Analysis
a) Load the patient samples, calibrators, and QC materials into the
designated racks on the analyzer. b) Program the analyzer with the
appropriate assay parameters. c) Start the assay run. The analyzer
will automatically aspirate the samples, mix them with reagents, and
measure the INHIBIN A concentration. d) Upon completion, retrieve
the results from the analyzer output.
1. RESULT VERIFICATION AND REPORTING
a) Review the analyzer output for each patient sample. b)
Compare the results with the QC data to ensure assay validity.
c) Enter confirmed results into the LIS for review and
verification by the laboratory supervisor. d) Verify results status
in the LIS and release the final bound results to the ordering
physician.
2. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Reference intervals for INHIBIN A should be provided by the
assay manufacturer. Refer to the package insert for specific
age and gender-specific reference ranges.
3. QUALITY CONTROL AND MAINTENANCE
a) Monthly: Perform a full system check including calibration
and running external quality assessment samples. b) Document
all quality control and maintenance activities in the QC log
book.
4. TROUBLESHOOTING AND LIMITATIONS
• Follow manufacturer's guidelines in the event of analyzer error or
unexpected results.
• Recognize that certain conditions (e.g., inappropriate sample
handling, hemolysis) may adversely affect tests results. Notify a
supervisor if encountered.
