Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for INHIBIN B, SERUM
Analysis
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedures for the analytical
phase of generating results for INHIBIN B, SERUM testing in order to
ensure accuracy, precision, and reliability of test results. This protocol
is to be strictly followed to maintain consistency in testing and
adherence to regulatory standards.
1. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel trained to conduct
INHIBIN B, SERUM analysis in a CLIA-certified laboratory setting.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
Laboratory personnel are responsible for performing the INHIBIN B,
SERUM analysis according to the procedures outlined in this SOP. It
is the responsibility of laboratory supervisors to ensure that staff
adhere to these procedures and that all equipment is correctly
maintained and calibrated.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type:
• Serum is the required specimen.
Specimen Collection:
• Collect blood using standard venipuncture techniques.
• Use a serum separator tube (SST).
• Allow the blood sample to clot at room temperature for 30-60
minutes.
• Centrifuge the SST at 1000-1300 x g for 10-15 minutes to
separate the serum from the clot.
Specimen Stability:
• Serum should be analyzed within 24 hours if stored at 2-8°C.
• For longer storage, serum should be frozen at -20°C or lower.
Specimen Handling:
• Handle specimens using standard precautions.
• Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
1. REAGENTS AND EQUIPMENT
Reagents:
• INHIBIN B, SERUM assay kit (manufacturer-specific)
• Calibrators and controls specific for INHIBIN B, SERUM assay
• Quality control material
Equipment:
• Microplate reader capable of measuring absorbance at
appropriate wavelengths as per the assay kit instructions
• Precision pipettes and tips
• Vortex mixer
• Centrifuge
• Incubator set to 37°C
• Appropriate PPE (personal protective equipment)
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation:
1. Ensure all reagents and kit components are brought to room
temperature before use.
2. Prepare the workstation by cleaning and organizing required
equipment.
3. Prepare all reagents, standards, and controls as detailed in the
assay kit instructions.
B. Assay Procedure:
1. Label all necessary plates and tubes according to the layout
provided in the assay kit protocol.
2. Pipette the prepared standards, controls, and serum samples
into the appropriate wells as outlined in the assay kit insert.
3. Add appropriate assay reagents and incubate as specified by
the assay protocol.
4. Follow the kit's instructions for washing steps to ensure
elimination of non-specific binding.
5. Add substrate reagent and incubate as specified in the kit
protocol.
6. Add the stop solution as stated in the assay instructions.
C. Reading and Data Management:
1. Measure the optical density (OD) of each well using a
microplate reader set to the appropriate wavelength.
2. Record the results and ensure all data is properly documented.
3. Calculate the concentration of INHIBIN B, SERUM in each
sample using the standard curve generated from the
calibrators.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
A. Quality Control Preparation:
• Prepare and include quality control samples in each run according
to the kit's instructions.
B. Internal Quality Control:
• Run low, medium, and high-level controls with each assay to
ensure assay performance.
C. Troubleshooting:
• If QC results fall outside acceptance criteria, investigate potential
errors (e.g., pipetting errors, equipment malfunction) and take
corrective action before reporting patient results.
• Document any issues and corrective actions taken.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
A. Result Validation:
• Verify that control samples meet acceptance criteria before
validating and reporting patient results.
B. Reporting:
• Enter results into the laboratory information system (LIS) following
laboratory-specific guidelines.
• Flag any critical values as per laboratory policy and notify the
appropriate healthcare provider as required.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Refer to the specific reference values provided by the assay kit
manufacturer or validated reference ranges established by the
laboratory for INHIBIN B, SERUM.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to the assay kit insert for specific limitations and
interferences that may affect the assay results.
• Analyze results in the context of the entire clinical scenario, and
do not rely solely on the assay result for clinical diagnosis.
1. REFERENCES

• Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines for
immunoassay testing.
1. DOCUMENTATION
This SOP should be reviewed annually or whenever the assay kit or
methodology undergoes significant changes. All personnel must be
trained and competency assessed before performing INHIBIN B,
SERUM analysis.
