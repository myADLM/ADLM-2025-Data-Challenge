Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Title: Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for INHIBIN IMMUNOSTAIN, TECHNICAL
COMPONENT ONLY
1. PURPOSE To provide a detailed procedure for the technical
component of INHIBIN immunostaining analysis, ensuring
consistency, accuracy, and adherence to laboratory standards.
2. SCOPE This procedure applies to the technical performance of
INHIBIN immunostaining for diagnostic purposes. It does not
encompass the interpretation of results, which is the responsibility of
a qualified pathologist.
3. RESPONSIBILITY It is the responsibility of designated laboratory
personnel trained in immunohistochemistry (IHC) techniques to
perform the procedures described in this document.
4. DEFINITIONS INHIBIN: A hormone primarily involved in the
regulation of the reproductive system, often used as a marker in
certain pathologies such as ovarian, adrenal, and testicular tumors.
5. MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT
• Microtome
• Water bath
• Positive and negative control tissue
• Primary antibody: INHIBIN
• Secondary antibody and detection system
• DAB substrate kit (or appropriate chromogen)
• Hematoxylin counterstain
• Xylene and ethanol (for deparaffinization and rehydration)
• Mounting medium and coverslips
• Slide labeling materials
• Timer
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
• Ventilation hood
• Microscope
6. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections cut at 4 µm
thickness.
• Specimens must be properly labeled with patient identification
and accompanied by a requisition form.
7. PROCEDURE
Step 1: Preparation of Tissue Sections
1. Cut tissue sections at 4 µm using a microtome and place them
on charged slides.
2. Allow slides to air dry overnight at room temperature or dry for 1
hour at 60°C in an oven.
Step 2: Deparaffinization and Rehydration
1. Deparaffinize tissue sections by immersing slides in xylene for 3
changes, 5 minutes each.
2. Rehydrate slides through graded ethanol series:
◦ 100% ethanol: 2 changes, 3 minutes each
◦ 95% ethanol: 2 minutes
◦ 70% ethanol: 2 minutes
3. Rinse slides in distilled water for 5 minutes.
Step 3: Antigen Retrieval
1. Perform antigen retrieval using an appropriate retrieval buffer
(e.g., citrate buffer, pH 6.0 or EDTA buffer, pH 8.0) in a
microwave, pressure cooker, or water bath according to
manufacturer's instructions.
2. Allow slides to cool for 20 minutes at room temperature.
3. Rinse slides in distilled water followed by PBS (phosphate-
buffered saline) for 5 minutes.
Step 4: Blocking Non-Specific Binding
1. Apply a blocking reagent (e.g., serum, BSA) to cover the tissue
sections and incubate for 10 minutes at room temperature.
2. Gently tap off excess blocking solution.
Step 5: Primary Antibody Incubation
1. Apply the primary INHIBIN antibody diluted in antibody diluent
to the tissue sections and incubate according to the antibody
manufacturer's recommendations (typically 30-60 minutes at
room temperature or overnight at 4°C).
2. Rinse slides in PBS, 3 changes, 5 minutes each.
Step 6: Secondary Antibody and Detection System
1. Apply the secondary antibody (linked to an enzyme such as
HRP) and incubate according to manufacturer's instructions
(typically 30 minutes at room temperature).
2. Rinse slides in PBS, 3 changes, 5 minutes each.
Step 7: Chromogenic Detection
1. Apply the DAB substrate (or appropriate chromogen) to the
tissue sections for visualization of the antigen-antibody
reaction.
2. Incubate until the desired staining intensity is achieved, typically
5-10 minutes. Monitor under the microscope.
3. Rinse slides in distilled water.
Step 8: Counterstaining
1. Counterstain slides with hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes.
2. Rinse in tap water and blue the nuclei by dipping in mildly
alkaline water (e.g., ammonia water).
Step 9: Dehydration and Mounting
1. Dehydrate slides through an ethanol series:
◦ 70% ethanol: 1 minute
◦ 95% ethanol: 1 minute
◦ 100% ethanol: 2 changes, 1 minute each
2. Clear in xylene, 3 changes, 1 minute each.
3. Apply mounting medium and cover with a coverslip.
Step 10: Quality Control
1. Include positive and negative controls with each batch of slides
to ensure staining accuracy.
2. Evaluate the quality of the staining under the microscope. The
positive control should show appropriate staining and the
negative control should be free of background staining.
8. REPORTING
• Provide stained slides to the pathologist for interpretation.
• Document any deviations from the protocol and corrective actions
taken.
