Protocol for Generating Results for Insulin-Like Growth Factor-1
(IGF-1) by Mass Spectrometry
1. Purpose: The purpose of this protocol is to provide
standardized procedures for the quantitative analysis of Insulin-
Like Growth Factor-1 (IGF-1) in serum using mass
spectrometry techniques. This procedure ensures accuracy,
reliability, and consistency in the laboratory testing outcomes.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory staff must follow the protocol
meticulously to perform the IGF-1 analysis using mass spectrometry.
It is the responsibility of all staff members to identify any deviations or
inconsistencies in the process and to alert the supervisor to address
these promptly.
1. Specimen: Preferred/Acceptable:
◦ Serum: 1 mL of serum collected in a red-top tube (without
gel separator) or a serum separator tube (SST).
◦ Ensure that specimens are centrifuged within 2 hours of
collection to separate serum from cells.
◦ Specimens should be stored at -20°C or colder if not
analyzed immediately.
Unacceptable: - Hemolyzed specimens. - Specimens with insufficient
quantity. - Specimens collected in any type of tube other than
specified above.
1. Equipment, Reagents, and Supplies:
◦ Mass spectrometer (Triple Quadrupole LC-MS/MS or
equivalent)
◦ High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system
◦ Centrifuge
◦ Vortex mixer
◦ Sample preparation kit for IGF-1 (includes specific columns
or clean-up plates)
◦ Calibrators and internal standards for IGF-1
◦ Methanol, acetonitrile, and other HPLC-grade solvents
◦ Mobile phase reagents
◦ Pipettes and pipette tips
◦ Test tubes and vials
◦ Refrigerated centrifuge for plasma separation
2. Procedure: A. Sample Preparation: - Thaw serum specimens if
frozen, and vortex to mix thoroughly. - Centrifuge the specimen
at 3,000 rpm for 10 minutes to ensure complete separation. -
Aliquot 150 µL of serum into a clean tube for analysis. - Add
internal standards to the aliquoted serum according to the kit
instructions. - Proceed with solid-phase extraction (SPE) or
clean-up using the sample preparation kit.
B. Calibration and Quality Control: - Prepare calibration curves
with IGF-1 standards across the clinically relevant range. - Run
internal quality controls (QC) including low, medium, and high-
range IGF-1 QC samples. - Ensure the mass spectrometer is
properly calibrated using manufacturers' protocols.
C. Mass Spectrometry Analysis: - Load prepared specimens
into the HPLC system connected to the mass spectrometer. -
Set the mass spectrometer to detect IGF-1 based on its specific
m/z ratio. - Ensure the mobile phase flow rate, temperature,
and gradient are optimized based on validated methods. -
Conduct MRM (multiple reaction monitoring) to detect IGF-1
and quantitate based on peak areas. - Run calibration
standards, specimens, and quality controls in sequence to
verify assay performance.
3. Data Analysis and Reporting:
◦ Extract raw data from the mass spectrometer.
◦ Use software to integrate peaks and calculate
concentrations of IGF-1.
◦ Review data to ensure quality control samples fall within
acceptable ranges.
◦ Verify that specimen results are consistent with the
calibration curve.
◦ Transmit verified results to the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
◦ Report results according to site-specific reporting guidelines.
4. Reference Intervals:
◦ Reference intervals are specific to the patient population
and age groups and should be determined based on clinical
validation studies.
5. Quality Control and Maintenance:
◦ Daily: Perform system suitability tests and calibrate the
mass spectrometer before each run.
◦ Weekly: Conduct thorough cleaning of the HPLC system
and mass spectrometer.
◦ Monthly: Validate instrument performance with calibration
and quality control protocols.
6. Method Limitations:
◦ Hemolyzed specimens may not yield accurate results.
◦ High levels of interference from other proteins or substances
in serum could affect detection.
7. References:
◦ Specific mass spectrometry instrument user manuals.
◦ Published literature and validation studies for IGF-1
measurement using mass spectrometry.
This SOP must be reviewed and updated regularly to ensure it
adheres to the latest advancements and regulatory requirements in
mass spectrometry and IGF-1 analysis.
