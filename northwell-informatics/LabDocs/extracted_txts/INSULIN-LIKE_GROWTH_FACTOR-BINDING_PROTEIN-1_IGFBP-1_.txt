Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Analytical Procedures for Assay of Insulin-Like Growth Factor-
Binding Protein-1 (IGFBP-1)
1. PURPOSE: To define the procedures for the measurement of
Insulin-Like Growth Factor-Binding Protein-1 (IGFBP-1) levels
in human specimens. This protocol aims to ensure accurate,
reliable and reproducible results that can be utilized for clinical
diagnostics and patient management.
2. SCOPE: This procedure applies to the analysis of IGFBP-1 in
specimens that have already been collected, received, and
accessioned in the laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY: Designated and trained laboratory
personnel are responsible for carrying out the procedures
outlined in this SOP. All staff members are responsible for
adhering to the protocol and reporting any issues or deviations
to their supervisor.
4. REFERENCES: Refer to the specific IGFBP-1 assay kit manual
and product inserts for detailed information on assay
components, handling, and safety information.
5. DEFINITION: IGFBP-1 is a protein that binds to insulin-like
growth factors I and II (IGF-I and IGF-II), thereby regulating
their biological activity.
6. EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS:
• IGFBP-1 ELISA kit (or similar immunoassay kit)
• Calibrated micropipettes and tips
• Vortex mixer
• Microplate washer (or manual washing alternatives)
• Microplate reader with a suitable wavelength filter (e.g., 450 nm)
• Distilled or deionized water
• Laboratory-specific personal protective equipment (PPE)
• Timer
• Absorbent paper
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS:
• Plasma or serum samples are the preferred specimen types for
IGFBP-1 analysis.
• Collect blood using a serum or plasma separator tube, and
process the sample according to standard procedures.
• Store specimens at 2-8°C if analyses are performed within 24
hours; for longer storage, keep at -20°C or lower, ensuring
multiple freeze-thaw cycles are avoided.
1. REAGENTS STABILITY AND STORAGE:
• Store all reagents as per the instructions provided in the IGFBP-1
assay kit manual.
• Do not use reagent solutions beyond their expiration dates.
• Ensure proper reconstitution and handling techniques as
described in the kit insert.
1. CALIBRATION AND QUALITY CONTROL:
• Run calibration standards and quality control samples within each
assay to ensure accuracy and precision.
• Follow the specific calibration procedures outlined in the assay kit
insert.
• Ensure that obtained calibration curves meet acceptance criteria
before running patient samples.
1. PROCEDURE: A. Preparation:
◦ Bring all reagents and specimens to room temperature
before use (typically 20-25°C).
◦ Set up the required dilution series for calibration standards
as directed in the assay manual.
B. Immunoassay Procedure: - Label the microplate wells for
standards, controls, and patient samples. - Add an appropriate
volume of standards, quality controls, and patient samples to
designated wells. - Add reagent to each well as directed by the assay
protocol. - Incubate the microplate for the specified time at the
recommended temperature. - Wash the wells appropriately using a
microplate washer or manual washing technique to remove unbound
material. - Add the enzyme conjugate to each well, followed by the
substrate solution and incubate for a specified time in the dark. - Stop
the reaction by adding the stop solution supplied in the kit.
C. Measurement: - Immediately measure the absorbance of each
well at the specified wavelength (typically 450 nm) using a microplate
reader. - Record the absorbance values for analysis.
1. CALCULATION OF RESULTS:
• Generate a calibration curve from the absorbance values of the
standards.
• Plot the absorbance values against the known concentrations to
establish a standard curve.
• Use the equation derived from the linear portion of the curve to
interpolate sample IGFBP-1 concentrations.
• Ensure that the concentrations of quality control samples fall
within the acceptable range prior to reporting patient results.
1. REPORTING RESULTS:
• Report results according to site-specific reporting guidelines.
• Ensure that values are within the dynamic range of the assay;
samples exceeding the range should be re-assayed after
appropriate dilution.
• Record and sign off the results in the laboratory information
system (LIS).
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
• Refer to the specific assay insert for method limitations regarding
interference, cross-reactivity, and other analytical considerations.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING:
• If calibration or controls fall outside of the expected ranges,
recheck procedures, reagent storage conditions, and instrument
calibration.
• Document and report recurring issues to a laboratory supervisor
for further action.
1. QUALITY CONTROL AND DOCUMENTATION:
• Maintain documentation of all assay runs including reagent lot
numbers, calibration curves, controls, and sample results.
• Regularly review the assay performance and update procedures
as new information or technologies arise.
