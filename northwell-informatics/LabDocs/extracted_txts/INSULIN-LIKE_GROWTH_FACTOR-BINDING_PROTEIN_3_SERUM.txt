Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Measuring Insulin-Like
Growth Factor-Binding Protein 3 (IGFBP-3) in Serum
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the quantitative
measurement of Insulin-Like Growth Factor-Binding Protein 3
(IGFBP-3) in serum samples. Accurate measurement of IGFBP-3
levels is essential for evaluating growth disorders and diagnostic
purposes.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory staff to perform the
assay as outlined in this procedure, to ensure quality control, and to
report results accurately.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/acceptable:
• Serum: Collect blood in a red-top tube, allow to clot fully at room
temperature, and centrifuge within 2 hours of collection.
• The serum must be aliquoted and stored at -20°C or lower if
testing is not immediately performed.
Unacceptable:
• Specimens with severe hemolysis.
• Specimens not properly labeled with collection date/time.
• Specimens collected in anticoagulant tubes (e.g., EDTA, heparin).
1. REAGENTS, SUPPLIES, AND EQUIPMENT
• IGFBP-3 ELISA kit or chemiluminescence-based assay
• Calibrators and Controls
• Micropipettes and tips
• Plate reader capable of reading at 450nm (for ELISA) or
chemiluminescence detector
• Centrifuge
• Refrigerator/freezer for specimen storage
• Disposable gloves
• Laboratory SOP documentation
1. PROCEDURE
Pre-assay Preparation:
1. Ensure all reagents are at room temperature before use.
2. Prepare calibration curve using provided standards according
to the manufacturer's instructions.
3. Run quality controls at two levels (low and high) to ensure
assay integrity.
Assay Procedure using ELISA (Example):
1. Pipette 100 µL of each calibrator, control, and serum sample
into appropriate wells. Duplicate measures are recommended.
2. Add 100 µL of the assay reagent (labeled as IGFBP-3 antibody
conjugate) to each well.
3. Incubate the plate at room temperature for 1 hour (or according
to manufacturer's instructions).
4. Wash plate thoroughly with buffer provided in the kit to remove
excess reagents.
5. Add 100 µL of substrate solution to each well.
6. Incubate plate in dark conditions at room temperature for 15-30
minutes.
7. Add 100 µL of stop solution to halt the reaction.
8. Read absorbance at 450 nm using a microplate reader.
Assay Procedure using Chemiluminescence (Example):
1. Pipette the required volume of calibrators, controls, and serum
samples into appropriate tubes.
2. Add the chemiluminescent agent(s) as per the kit’s instructions.
3. Mix thoroughly and incubate for the specified time as indicated
by the manufacturer.
4. Read results using a chemiluminescence detector.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
Quality control materials should be run with each batch to verify
assay performance. If quality control results are outside of the
established range, recalibration and reassessment must be
performed before patient results can be reported.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
Results should be reviewed for consistency with quality control
measures. Reference intervals must be established and used
consistently.
Reference Intervals:
• IGFBP-3 levels in serum: [Provide specific ranges based on lab
validation]
Critical Results:
• Results which fall outside of reference intervals must be flagged
and communicated as per laboratory protocol.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to assay kit insert for specific limitations, potential
interferences, and troubleshooting guidelines.

• Clinician guidelines and consultation notes regarding usage and
interpretation of IGFBP-3.
1. DOCUMENT CONTROL
Any changes or updates to this procedure must be approved by the
laboratory manager.
This protocol is subject to regular review to ensure compliance with
evolving laboratory standards and scientific advancements.
