Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase:
INSULIN-LIKE GROWTH FACTOR 1 (IGF-1) AND INSULIN-LIKE
GROWTH FACTOR-BINDING PROTEIN 3 (IGFBP-3) GROWTH
PANEL, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
To provide accurate and reliable measurements of Insulin-Like
Growth Factor 1 (IGF-1) and Insulin-Like Growth Factor-Binding
Protein 3 (IGFBP-3) in serum samples, ensuring the generation of
valid clinical results.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for following this
SOP to perform analytical procedures on collected and accessioned
serum samples for IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 tests. It is the responsibility of
all staff performing these assays to ensure quality control measures
are strictly adhered to, and any deviations are promptly addressed
and documented.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS:
• Preferred: Serum samples collected in a red-top tube or a serum
separator tube (SST).
• Volume: At least 0.5 mL of serum is required for the analysis.
• Stability: Serum samples are stable for up to 24 hours at room
temperature (15-25°C), 7 days refrigerated (2-8°C), or up to 28
days when frozen at -20°C or lower.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES:
Equipment:
• Centrifuge capable of achieving 3500 RPM.
• Automated Immunoassay Analyzer (e.g., Roche Cobas e411,
Siemens IMMULITE 2000).
• Precision pipettes and tips.
• Refrigerator and Freezer (for storage of reagents and samples).
Reagents:
• Calibrators and controls specific for IGF-1 and IGFBP-3.
• Serum assay controls, including high, medium, and low control
levels.
• Assay-specific reagents provided by the manufacturer.
Supplies:
• Sample tubes.
• Latex gloves.
• Bench protectors.
• Pipette tips.
4. PROCEDURE:
1. Pre-Analytical Phase:
◦ Verify patient information and specimen integrity; ensure
samples meet criteria for analysis (i.e., volume, labeling,
storage conditions).
2. Sample Preparation:
◦ Thaw frozen serum samples at room temperature.
◦ Mix gently to ensure homogeneity before analysis.
3. Calibration and Quality Control:
◦ Perform calibration of the immunoassay analyzer as per
manufacturer instructions.
◦ Run high, medium, and low-quality control samples before
starting patient samples.
◦ Acceptable control values should fall within the specified
range provided by the manufacturer. If control results are
out of range, do not proceed with patient samples until
resolved.
4. Analytical Run:
◦ Load patient samples onto the immunoassay analyzer
following the instrument’s operational manual.
◦ Ensure samples, controls, and calibrators are properly
positioned in the designated slots.
5. Performing the Assay:
◦ Select the appropriate test (IGF-1 and/or IGFBP-3) on the
analyzer.
◦ Start the assay as per the analyzer’s standard operating
instructions.
◦ Verify that the instrument performs within specified limits
throughout the process and address any alerts or error
messages.
6. Result Generation and Review:
◦ Review analyzer-generated results for each patient,
ensuring all controls are within acceptable limits.
◦ Assess any flagged results with caution. If results fall
outside the standard calibration curve, repeat the analysis
using diluted samples as necessary.
7. Documentation:
◦ Record all relevant data in the laboratory information system
(LIS), including but not limited to sample ID, test run, control
results, calibrations, and any troubleshooting steps or
deviations observed.
◦ Verify and authenticate results before reporting.
5. REPORTING RESULTS:
• Results will be automatically transmitted to the LIS.
• Laboratory personnel must review and verify the results before
final reporting.
• Critical values must be communicated immediately to the
requesting healthcare provider and properly documented.
6. QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE:
Internal quality control material (e.g., high, medium, and low controls)
should be analyzed with each batch of patient samples. External
proficiency testing should be performed periodically, following the
recommendations of accrediting agencies and internal laboratory
protocols.
7. REPORTABLE VALUES AND INTERPRETATION:
Refer to methodology-specific reference ranges provided by the
manufacturer. Results deviating from expected values require review
and potential re-analysis.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS:
Refer to manufacturer's assay-specific data for potential
interferences, limitations in sensitivity, specificity, and linearity range.
Any analysis impacted by these limitations should be addressed and
documented appropriately.

• Manufacturer's assays insert and instruction manuals for IGF-1
and IGFBP-3.
