Protocol for the Analytical Phase of Generating Results for
INSULIN-LIKE GROWTH FACTOR 1 (IGF1), BLOOD
1. PURPOSE
To ensure the accurate and timely measurement of Insulin-Like
Growth Factor 1 (IGF-1) in blood samples. This protocol outlines the
procedures for the analytical phase of IGF-1 testing, including sample
preparation, assay procedures, quality control, and result reporting.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory staff are responsible for performing IGF-1
testing using the indicated procedures, recording raw data,
performing quality control checks, and reporting results.
• Laboratory supervisors are responsible for reviewing test results,
addressing any discrepancies, and ensuring proper
documentation.
1. DEFINITION
IGF-1 is a hormone similar in molecular structure to insulin and plays
a crucial role in growth and development.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred Sample:
• Serum or plasma (EDTA or Lithium heparin).
• Minimum volume of 1 mL is required for analysis.
Unacceptable Samples:
• Hemolyzed samples
• Samples with gross lipemia or icterus
Handling and Storage:
• Samples should be collected following standard venipuncture
procedures.
• Store plasma or serum at 2-8°C if the assay is performed within
24 hours. For longer storage, samples should be frozen at -20°C
or below.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• IGF-1 ELISA kit or specific automated immunoassay system.
• Micro-pipettes and tips.
• Calibrated centrifuge.
• Sample tubes and racks.
• Refrigerator and freezer.
• Disposable gloves and other PPE.
• Quality control materials and calibrators.
• Timer.
1. PROCEDURE
2. Sample Preparation:
◦ Spin blood samples at 1500 x g for 10 minutes to separate
plasma/serum.
◦ Aliquot required volume into labeled microcentrifuge tubes.
◦ If not analyzed immediately, store samples appropriately
detailed in section 3.
3. Assay Initialization:
◦ Prepare reagents according to manufacturer’s instructions
provided in the ELISA kit or automated system
documentation.
◦ Ensure all equipment is calibrated and validation records
are up-to-date.
◦ Establish the plate layout or system setup including
calibration standards, quality controls, and patient samples.
4. Assay Execution:
◦ Perform the assay as per manufacturer instructions (ELISA
protocol or automated system steps).
◦ For ELISA: Mix samples and reagents carefully, measure
absorbance using a microplate reader.
◦ For automated systems: Load samples accordingly for
analysis.
◦ Note: Always follow timing, temperature conditions, and
procedural specifics from the manufacturer.
5. Quality Control:
◦ Run internal quality controls and calibrators with each batch
of testing.
◦ Validate control values against target ranges specified by
the manufacturer.
◦ Record any deviations and retest if necessary.
6. Data Recording and Result Analysis:
◦ Collect raw data using the computerized system or manual
recording from microplate reader output.
◦ Verify the integrity of the data including standard curve
acceptance and control values.
◦ Calculate patient IGF-1 concentrations using software or
manual methods correlating absorbance with reference
standards.
7. Reporting Results:
◦ Enter results into Laboratory Information System (LIS).
◦ Review and verify by designated staff.
◦ Flag any critical values according to laboratory protocol and
procedures.
◦ Document results and ensure appropriate follow-up actions
for abnormal findings.
8. Sample Integrity Checks:
◦ Examine samples for hemolysis, lipemia, or icterus.
◦ Use the best judgment for reporting based on the
specimen's condition.
9. Critical Result Management:
◦ Follow laboratory protocol to report critical results
immediately to healthcare providers with the necessary
documentation.
10. Troubleshooting:
◦ If technical issues arise during assay execution, refer to
product insert troubleshooting guide.
◦ If results are inconsistent or questionable, repeat the assay
with a new aliquot.
11. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Consult laboratory reference standards provided by the reagent
manufacturer or latest clinical guidelines for age and sex-specific
IGF-1 reference ranges.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the specific IGF-1 assay manufacturer insert for individual
limitations, including reagent stability, interference factors, and assay
sensitivity.
