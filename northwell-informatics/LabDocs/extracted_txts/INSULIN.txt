Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase:
Insulin Testing
1. PURPOSE
To provide a detailed, standardized protocol for the analysis of insulin
levels in patient specimens to ensure accuracy, reliability, and
consistency of results.
RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory staff to perform
insulin testing according to this SOP. All staff are responsible for
reporting any deviations or issues to the supervisor immediately.
1. DEFINITION
This SOP covers the analytical phase of insulin testing, which
involves the processing, analysis, and result generation from patient
specimens previously collected, received, and accessioned.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
a. Specimen Type:
◦ Serum or plasma collected in a red-top or green-top tube
(Heparin).
◦ Preferred: Serum separated from clot within 2 hours of
collection.
b. Specimen Volume:
◦ At least 2 mL of serum or plasma.
c. Specimen Storage:
◦ Store serum or plasma refrigerated at 2-8°C if testing is
performed within 24 hours.
◦ For longer storage, samples should be frozen at -20°C or
lower.
d. Unacceptable Specimens:
◦ Hemolysed specimens.
◦ Specimens collected in tubes containing EDTA or other
anticoagulants not recommended for insulin testing.
◦ Specimens that are not properly labeled.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Automated immunoassay analyzer (e.g., Roche Cobas e411,
Siemens Immulite)
• Insulin reagent kit specific to the analyzer in use.
• Calibrators and control materials (two levels: normal and high).
• Micropipettes and tips.
• Test tubes or sample cups.
• Timer.
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE).
5. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation and Calibration:
i. Inspect the analyzer to ensure it is operational and properly maintained.
ii. Load the analyzer with the insulin reagent kit, following the manufacturer’s instructions.
iii. Perform a two-point calibration using the provided calibrators, adhering to the manufacturer’s instructions.
iv. Run quality control materials at both normal and high levels before patient sample analysis and after every 20 patient samples or after any maintenance.
B. Sample Preparation and Loading:
i. Thaw frozen specimens at room temperature and mix gently.
ii. Centrifuge serum or plasma specimens at 1500-2000 g for 10 minutes.
iii. Load the processed specimens into the analyzer as per the manufacturer’s instructions, ensuring proper barcode reading or manual entry of specimen IDs.
C. Analyzing Samples:
i. Initiate the analysis sequence using the analyzer’s operational guidelines.
ii. Monitor the analysis process for any error messages or alerts generated by the system.
iii. Verify that the quality control results are within acceptable limits before reporting patient results. If QC results are not within limits, troubleshoot as necessary and repeat the quality control procedure.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
a. Review and Verification: - Results are automatically transmitted
to the Laboratory Information System (LIS). - The technologist must
review and verify results, ensuring they are within the linear
reportable range.
b. Reporting Critical Values: - Document and report all critical
values immediately to the requesting healthcare provider as per
laboratory policy.
c. Sample Integrity and Comment: - Assess the integrity of each
sample. If any hemolysis or other signs of sample deterioration are
noted, add an appropriate comment to the result report.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
a. Internal Quality Control: - Run and record results of two levels
(normal and high) of quality control materials with each batch. - If
control results fall outside the acceptable range, do not report patient
results until the issue is resolved.
b. External Validation: - Participate in external proficiency testing
programs regularly. - Compare internal results with external
proficiency results to ensure testing accuracy.
8. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS
a. Follow all standard lab safety protocols, including the use of PPE.
b. Handle all specimens as potentially infectious material and dispose
of biohazard waste appropriately. c. Clean and decontaminate all
work surfaces and equipment after each use.
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Refer to the specific analyzer and insulin assay kit inserts for
potential method limitations, interferences, and cross-reactivity.
