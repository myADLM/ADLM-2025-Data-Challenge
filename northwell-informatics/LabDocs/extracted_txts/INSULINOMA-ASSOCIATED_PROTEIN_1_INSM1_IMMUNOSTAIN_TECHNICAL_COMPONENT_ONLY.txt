Protocol for the Analytical Phase of Generating Results for
Insulinoma-associated Protein 1 (INSM1), Immunostain,
Technical Component Only
1. PURPOSE
This protocol outlines the standardized procedures for the analytical
phase of generating results for Insulinoma-associated Protein 1
(INSM1) using immunostaining techniques. This ensures accurate
and consistent technical results for diagnostic purposes.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
Laboratory personnel trained in immunohistochemistry (IHC) are
responsible for performing the technical component of the INSM1
immunostain. Supervisors ensure that all steps are carried out
according to the protocol.
1. SPECIMEN
Specimens suitable for INSM1 immunostaining include formalin-fixed,
paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue sections.
Unacceptable specimens:
• Specimens without proper labeling.
• Specimens that are inadequately fixed or excessively decalcified.
• Specimens with visible contamination or damage.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
◦ Microtome
◦ Water bath
◦ Positively charged glass slides
◦ Paraffin oven
◦ Xylene
◦ Ethanol series
◦ Distilled water
◦ Antigen retrieval buffer (e.g., citrate buffer, pH 6.0)
◦ Pressure cooker or microwave for antigen retrieval
◦ Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) blocking solution
◦ Protein blocking solution
◦ Primary antibody against INSM1
◦ Secondary antibody (HRP-conjugated)
◦ Chromogen substrate (e.g., DAB)
◦ Hematoxylin for counterstaining
◦ Mounting medium and coverslips
◦ Control tissue slides
2. PROCEDURE
A. Tissue Sectioning and Preparation
1. Cut 3-5 μm thick sections from FFPE tissue blocks using a
microtome.
2. Float sections on a 40-45°C water bath, then mount onto
positively charged glass slides.
3. Place slides in a 60°C oven for 30 minutes to overnight to
ensure tissue adherence.
B. Deparaffinization and Rehydration
1. Deparaffinize slides by immersing in xylene for 3 changes, 5
minutes each.
2. Rehydrate through graded ethanol series (100%, 95%, 70%) for
3 minutes each.
3. Rinse in distilled water for 5 minutes.
C. Antigen Retrieval
1. Perform antigen retrieval by immersing slides in citrate buffer
(pH 6.0) and heating in a pressure cooker or microwave for
10-20 minutes.
2. Allow slides to cool in buffer for 20 minutes.
3. Rinse in distilled water.
D. Blocking Endogenous Peroxidase Activity
1. Incubate slides in a 3% H2O2 solution for 10 minutes at room
temperature to block endogenous peroxidase activity.
2. Rinse in distilled water followed by phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS).
E. Blocking Non-specific Binding
1. Apply protein blocking solution to slides and incubate for 10
minutes at room temperature.
2. Tap off excess blocking solution. Do not rinse.
F. Incubation with Primary Antibody
1. Apply primary antibody (anti-INSM1) to the slides and incubate
for 1 hour at room temperature or overnight at 4°C in a
humidified chamber.
2. Rinse slides in PBS, 3 changes, 5 minutes each.
G. Incubation with Secondary Antibody
1. Apply HRP-conjugated secondary antibody and incubate for 30
minutes at room temperature.
2. Rinse slides in PBS, 3 changes, 5 minutes each.
H. Chromogen Development
1. Apply DAB chromogen substrate and incubate for 5-10 minutes
or until optimal color development is achieved.
2. Rinse slides in distilled water.
I. Counterstaining
1. Immerse slides in hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes for
counterstaining.
2. Rinse in distilled water and differentiate in acid alcohol if
necessary.
3. Wash in running tap water for 5 minutes.
J. Dehydration and Mounting
1. Dehydrate slides through graded ethanol series (70%, 95%,
100%) for 3 minutes each.
2. Clear in xylene, 2 changes, 5 minutes each.
3. Apply mounting medium and coverslip.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Include both positive and negative control tissue slides with
each batch of patient slides.
◦ Ensure proper staining intensity and distribution in positive
controls.
◦ Confirm absence of staining in negative controls.
◦ Re-run any batch with control failures.
5. RESULTS INTERPRETATION AND REPORTING
◦ The technical component involves preparing stained slides
for pathologist review.
◦ Pathologists will independently review and interpret the
stained slides.
◦ Report findings according to laboratory protocols and
include staining patterns, intensity, and localization of
INSM1.
6. REFERENCES
◦ Manufacturer’s instructions for antibodies and reagents.
◦ Standard immunohistochemistry textbooks and literature for
best practices.
This protocol ensures consistency and reliability in the technical
preparation of INSM1 immunostains, contributing to accurate
diagnosis and patient care.
