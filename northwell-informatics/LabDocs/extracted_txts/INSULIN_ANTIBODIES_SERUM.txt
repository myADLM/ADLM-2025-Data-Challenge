INSULIN ANTIBODIES, SERUM ANALYTICAL PHASE PROTOCOL
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedures for the analysis and generation of results
for insulin antibodies in serum using a designated immunoassay
method, ensuring accuracy, reliability, and timely reporting.
Responsibility:
• It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory staff to perform,
monitor, and document all aspects of the insulin antibodies test
analysis.
• It is the responsibility of the Laboratory Supervisor to ensure that
staff follow these procedures and that all equipment is functioning
according to the manufacturer’s specifications.
1. DEFINITION
Insulin Antibodies: These are antibodies produced by the body’s
immune system in response to insulin therapy, potentially leading to
insulin neutralization and altered glucose metabolism.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Acceptable Specimen:
• Serum collected in a red-top tube or SST (serum separator tube).
• Minimum volume: 1 mL serum.
• Specimens must be free of hemolysis, lipemia, and icterus.
Unacceptable Specimen:
• Plasma or whole blood specimens.
• Grossly hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric specimens.
Specimen Stability:
• Room Temperature: 24 hours
• Refrigerated (2-8°C): 7 days
• Frozen (-20°C or lower): Stable for 6 months
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• Immunoassay analyzer (as specified by the laboratory)
• Assay-specific reagent kits for insulin antibodies
• Calibrators and controls provided by the manufacturer
• Micropipettes and tips
• Vortex mixer
• Centrifuge
• Laboratory glassware
• Timer
1. PROCEDURE
5.1 Preparation
• Verify the specimen integrity and appropriateness according to
the specimen requirements.
• Allow refrigerated specimens to reach room temperature before
analysis.
• Set up the immunoassay analyzer according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
5.2 Calibration and Quality Control
• Perform a calibration procedure using the assay-specific
calibrators as per the manufacturer’s protocol.
• Run quality control (QC) materials of known concentrations at two
levels (low and high) to ensure the analyzer is working correctly.
• Document all calibration and QC results in the laboratory log. If
QC results fall outside the acceptable range, troubleshoot and
resolve any issues before proceeding with patient samples.
5.3 Analysis
• Load the serum samples, calibrators, and controls into the
immunoassay analyzer according to the manufacturer’s
guidelines.
• Enter the required information into the instrument, including
sample ID, controls, and calibration data.
• Initiate the run and monitor the analyzer to ensure the assay is
progressing correctly.
5.4 Result Interpretation
• After the run is completed, review the generated data including
calibration curve and QC results to verify assay performance.
• Compare patient sample results to QC results to ensure accurate
reporting.
• Document any deviations from expected results and follow
troubleshooting protocols as necessary.
5.5 Reporting Results
• Transmit results electronically to the Laboratory Information
System (LIS) and review for accuracy.
• Any critical results must be communicated immediately to the
requesting physician following laboratory policy.
• For results that fall outside the assay’s reportable range, follow
the manufacturer's guidelines for re-analysis or dilution.
1. QUALITY CONTROL AND LIMITATIONS
• Conduct internal QC according to laboratory protocols. Document
all QC activities and take corrective actions as needed.
• Method limitations should be considered; refer to the
manufacturer’s insert for detailed information regarding potential
interferences and assay limitations.
1. MAINTENANCE
• Regular maintenance of the immunoassay analyzer should be
performed according to the manufacturer’s schedule.
• Document all maintenance activities and any issues encountered
in the maintenance log.
• Calibration and QC material expiration dates should be
monitored, and expired materials must not be used.
1. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer’s Instructions for Use for the specific immunoassay
analyzer and reagent kit being utilized.
• Laboratory QC protocol documents.
• Relevant clinical guidelines for the interpretation of insulin
antibody results.
By following this protocol, laboratory personnel will ensure the
reliable and timely generation of insulin antibody results, thus
supporting the clinical management of patients undergoing insulin
therapy.
