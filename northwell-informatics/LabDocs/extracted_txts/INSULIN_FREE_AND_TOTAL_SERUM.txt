Standard Operating Procedure for Analysis of Insulin, Free and
Total, Serum
1. PURPOSE
To provide detailed instructions for the analysis and generation of
results for Insulin, Free and Total, Serum.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of designated staff to perform and document
the analysis as defined in this procedure. All staff are responsible for
identifying deficiencies or issues that may affect test results and
informing a supervisor.
2. DEFINITION
• Insulin, Free: The portion of insulin in serum that is not bound to
proteins.
• Insulin, Total: The sum of both free and protein-bound insulin in
serum.
3. SPECIMEN
• Preferred Specimen: Fasting serum collected in a red-top or
serum separator tube (SST)
• Acceptable Specimen: Serum stored at 2-8°C for up to 48 hours
or frozen at -20°C for longer stability.
• Unacceptable Specimen: Hemolyzed, lipemic, or improperly
stored specimens.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Insulin ELISA Kit or chemiluminescent immunoassay
• Pipettes and tips
• Centrifuge
• Plate reader or automated analyzer
• Calibrators and controls
• Serum separator tubes (SST)
• Laboratory timer
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
5. PROCEDURE
A. Preparation and Calibration
1. Review the Insulin ELISA Kit or analyzer-specific instructions
prior to beginning the assay.
2. Allow all reagents and specimens to reach room temperature
before analysis.
3. Prepare standards and controls according to the kit instructions.
4. Calibrate the analyzer using the provided calibrators.
B. Sample Handling
1. Ensure specimens are properly identified and accessioned.
2. Prior to testing, ensure serum samples are clear and free from
hemolysis or lipemia.
3. If necessary, centrifuge serum at 1500 g for 10 minutes to
remove particulates.
C. Assay Setup
1. Label all wells or positions on the plate according to the
sample, standard, control, and blank positions.
2. Pipette appropriate amounts of standards, controls, and patient
samples into designated wells/cuvettes according to the assay
instructions.
3. Follow the specific steps in the assay protocol for adding
reagents, incubation periods, and washing steps.
D. Analysis
1. Allow reactions to proceed according to the specific assay
instructions.
2. Read absorbance/colorimetric or chemiluminescent signals
using the appropriate plate reader or analyzer.
E. Result Calculation
1. Generate a standard curve from the known concentrations of
the standards.
2. Calculate the concentration of insulin, free and total, in patient
samples using the generated standard curve.
6. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Run quality control samples with each batch of patient
specimens.
2. Ensure QC results fall within the acceptable range defined by
the manufacturer.
3. Document any deviations from QC limits and take corrective
actions as necessary.
4. Review QC data regularly and ensure instrument maintenance
as required.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Review the calculated results for Insulin, Free and Total, Serum.
2. Ensure all patient results are accurately recorded and cross-
referenced with patient identifiers.
3. Report results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
following site-specific reporting guidelines.
4. Verify all critical results according to laboratory protocols before
releasing.
Reference Intervals:
The reference intervals for serum insulin, free and total, will be noted
in the kit insert or calibration documentation. Verify these intervals
upon each lot verification.
Method Limitations:
Refer to the assay kit insert for specific limitations, such as the
potential for interference from certain medications or conditions
affecting insulin binding.

chemiluminescent immunoassay analyzer.
8. DOCUMENTATION AND FOLLOW UP
1. Record all steps and observations in the laboratory notebook or
electronic record.
2. Document any troubleshooting or deviations from the standard
procedure.
3. Communicate any issues or concerns to the supervisory staff
immediately.
Critical Result Reporting:
Follow the laboratory protocol for reporting critical values, ensuring
proper documentation and timely communication to the clinical team.
9. REVIEW AND REVISION
This SOP will be reviewed annually or when there are updates or
changes in the assay methodology. Updated versions will be
communicated to all relevant staff.
