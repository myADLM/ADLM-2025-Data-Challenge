Name] Approved By: [Insert Name]
1. PURPOSE
To ensure consistent, accurate, and reliable results for the
determination of Human Insulin and Immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels in
serum samples by establishing detailed procedures for the analytical
phase.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all laboratory personnel performing Human
Insulin and IgE assays in a CLIA-certified laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITIES
• Laboratory Technologists: Perform and document all steps of
the analytical procedures.
• Laboratory Supervisors: Ensure compliance with this SOP,
address deficiencies, and perform periodic audits.
4. DEFINITIONS
• Human Insulin: A peptide hormone produced by the pancreas.
• IgE: Immunoglobulin E, an antibody associated with allergic
responses.
5. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
Equipment:
• Automated immunoassay analyzer (e.g., Roche Cobas e411)
• Refrigerators and freezers (-20°C and -80°C)
• Calibrated pipettes
• Centrifuge
Reagents:
• Insulin assay reagent kit
• IgE assay reagent kit
• Quality control (QC) materials
• Calibrators
• Serum/plasma collection tubes (EDTA or SST)
• Deionized water
6. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation
1. Specimen Requirement:
◦ Venous blood collected in an SST or EDTA tube.
◦ Centrifuge samples at 1500 x g for 10 minutes to obtain
serum.
◦ Aliquot the serum into appropriately labeled tubes.
◦ Store samples at 2-8°C and analyze within 48 hours or
freeze at -20°C/-80°C for longer storage.
2. Acceptance Criteria:
◦ Clearly labeled samples with patient ID and collection date.
◦ Non-hemolyzed samples.
◦ Serum samples meeting the required volume (min. 500 µL).
3. Unacceptable Criteria:
◦ Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
◦ Mislabeled or unlabeled samples.
◦ Samples stored outside recommended conditions (W).
B. Assay Procedure - Human Insulin
1. Calibration and QC:
◦ Calibrate the analyzer according to the manufacturer’s
instructions using provided calibrators.
◦ Run low, middle, and high-level QC samples at the start of
each day, with each new reagent lot, and after maintenance.
2. Analysis:
◦ Load the prepared samples into the analyzer.
◦ Select the Insulin assay protocol.
◦ Verify that the analyzer correctly identifies and loads the
samples.
3. Result Generation:
◦ The analyzer processes the samples and outputs the
results.
◦ Review and validate the results against QC standards.
◦ Document any discrepancies and follow up according to the
lab’s corrective action protocols.
4. Troubleshooting:
◦ Follow manufacturer’s guidelines for any flagged results or
error messages.
◦ Repeat testing if QC results fall outside acceptable ranges.
◦ Consult a supervisor for persistent issues.
C. Assay Procedure - IgE
1. Calibration and QC:
◦ Calibrate the analyzer as per the instructions using the
provided calibrators.
◦ Run low, middle, and high-level QC samples at the start of
each day, with each new reagent lot, and after maintenance.
2. Analysis:
◦ Load the prepared samples into the analyzer.
◦ Select the IgE assay protocol.
◦ Verify that the analyzer correctly identifies and loads the
samples.
3. Result Generation:
◦ The analyzer processes the samples and outputs the
results.
◦ Review and validate the results against QC standards.
◦ Document any discrepancies and follow up according to the
lab’s corrective action protocols.
4. Troubleshooting:
◦ Follow manufacturer’s guidelines for any flagged results or
error messages.
◦ Repeat testing if QC results fall outside acceptable ranges.
◦ Consult a supervisor for persistent issues.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Use QC materials in parallel with patient samples.
• Maintain records of QC results, compare them against the lot-
specific ranges, and document any out-of-range results.
• Perform corrective measures as necessary and reanalyze
affected samples if QC failures occur.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results are reviewed and verified in the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
• Critical values must be communicated promptly to the ordering
physician and documented as per lab policy.
• Reports should be formatted according to the laboratory’s
reporting guidelines and dispatched without delay.
9. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to assay-specific package inserts for information on
interferences, limitations, and expected ranges.
• Ensure that the provided specimen-reacting parameters (e.g.,
hemolysis, lipemia) are thoroughly assessed and accounted for.
