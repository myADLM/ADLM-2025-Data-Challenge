Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Title: Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Insulin Immunostain, Technical
Component Only
1. PURPOSE
This procedure outlines the standardized analytical methodology
used to perform insulin immunostaining of tissue specimens,
ensuring consistency, accuracy, and reliability of results.
2. RESPONSIBILITY
Trained laboratory personnel or histotechnologists are responsible for
performing the immunostaining procedure according to this SOP. The
laboratory supervisor is responsible for reviewing and ensuring
adherence to this SOP.
3. DEFINITIONS
Immunostaining: A laboratory technique that uses antibodies to
detect the presence of specific proteins in tissue sections. Insulin: A
hormone produced by the pancreas important for the regulation of
glucose levels in the blood.
4. PROCEDURE
4.1 Specimen Preparation
4.1.1 Ensure that paraffin-embedded tissue blocks are prepared
correctly and are of high quality.
4.1.2 Cut sections from the paraffin blocks at a thickness of 4-5
microns using a microtome.
4.1.3 Mount sections on positively charged glass slides and dry
overnight at 37°C or for 1 hour at 60°C.
4.2 Reagent Preparation
4.2.1 Prepare and validate all reagents and antibody solutions before
use.
4.2.2 Dilute the primary insulin antibody as per the manufacturer's
instructions.
4.2.3 Prepare the secondary antibody and other staining reagents as
per their respective protocols.
4.3 Immunostaining Protocol
4.3.1 Deparaffinization:
• Deparaffinize the tissue sections in three changes of xylene for 5
minutes each.
• Rehydrate the sections through graded alcohol series: 100%,
95%, 70% ethanol for 2 minutes each and then rinse in distilled
water.
4.3.2 Antigen Retrieval:
• Perform heat-induced antigen retrieval using citrate buffer (pH
6.0) or EDTA buffer (pH 8.0) in a microwave or pressure cooker
as per the antibody manufacturer's recommendations.
• Allow the sections to cool down to room temperature for 20
minutes and then rinse in distilled water.
4.3.3 Blocking Endogenous Peroxidase Activity:
• Incubate the slides in 3% hydrogen peroxide solution for 10
minutes to quench endogenous peroxidase activity.
• Rinse in distilled water.
4.3.4 Blocking Non-Specific Binding:
• Apply a protein block (such as 5% bovine serum albumin or 10%
normal goat serum) for 30 minutes at room temperature to block
non-specific binding sites.
• Wash the slides in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).
4.3.5 Primary Antibody Incubation:
• Incubate the sections with diluted primary insulin antibody for 1
hour at room temperature or overnight at 4°C in a humidified
chamber.
• Rinse in PBS.
4.3.6 Secondary Antibody and Detection System:
• Apply biotinylated secondary antibody according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Incubate for 30 minutes at room
temperature.
• Wash the slides in PBS.
• Apply the streptavidin-biotin complex (ABC) reagent for 30
minutes at room temperature or use the polymer-based detection
system as per manufacturer’s instructions.
• Wash the slides in PBS.
4.3.7 Chromogen Development:
• Incubate the sections with the chromogen substrate solution
(such as DAB: 3,3′-diaminobenzidine) until desired staining
intensity develops, usually 5–10 minutes.
• Monitor under a light microscope.
• Rinse in distilled water.
4.3.8 Counterstaining and Mounting:
• Counterstain with hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes to visualize the cell
nuclei.
• Rinse in tap water and then distilled water.
• Dehydrate sections through graded ethanol series (70%, 95%,
100%) and clear in xylene.
• Mount the slides with permanent mounting medium and cover
with coverslips.
4.4 Quality Control
4.4.1 Include positive and negative controls with each batch of
staining to validate the procedure. 4.4.2 Review stained sections
under a microscope to ensure quality and consistency. 4.4.3
Document any discrepancies and take pertinent corrective actions if
staining quality fails.
4.5 Documentation and Reporting
4.5.1 Record all details of the procedure in the laboratory log book
including the batch number of reagents used, incubation times, and
any deviations from the protocol.
4.5.2 Ensure that slides are appropriately labeled with patient
identification and unique slide number.
4.5.3 The slides should be sent to the pathologist for interpretation.
