Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Title: Measurement of Serum Insulin
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to provide a standardized procedure for
the measurement of serum insulin levels in patients' blood samples to
ensure consistent, accurate, and reliable results.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of all trained laboratory staff to follow this SOP.
Laboratory technicians are responsible for performing the analysis,
and supervisors are responsible for reviewing and verifying results.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen Type:
• Serum
Specimen Collection:
• Collect blood into a serum separator tube (SST, yellow top) or
plain red top tube.
• Allow the blood to clot for 30 minutes at room temperature.
• Centrifuge the blood within 1 hour of collection at 1300-1800 x g
for 10 minutes at room temperature to separate the serum.
Storage and Stability:
• The separated serum should be stored at 2-8°C if the analysis will
be performed within 48 hours.
• For long-term storage, serum aliquots should be stored at -20°C
or lower. Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Centrifuge
• Insulin ELISA or Chemiluminescent Immunoassay (CLIA)
analyzer (manufacturer-specific, e.g., Roche Cobas, Abbott
Architect, etc.)
• Micropipettes and tips
Reagents:
• Insulin assay reagents (provided by the manufacturer, e.g., assay
buffer, enzyme conjugate, substrate solution, and stop solution if
performing ELISA)
• Quality control materials (Low, Medium, High levels)
• Calibrators/Standards
Supplies:
• Serum separator tubes (SST) or red top tubes
• Disposable gloves
• Timer
• Labeled sample tubes for aliquoting serum
1. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Quality Control and Calibration:
◦ Run quality control specimens (Low, Medium, High) before
beginning patient sample analysis to ensure the accuracy of
the assay.
◦ Perform calibration using standards as specified by the
manufacturer. Calibration should be performed in
accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions.
Sample Analysis:
1. Labeling:
◦ Ensure that all patient samples are correctly labeled with the
unique patient identifier.
2. Loading Samples for Automated Analyzers:
◦ Load the samples, calibrators, and quality controls onto the
designated positions in the analyzer as per the
manufacturer's instructions.
◦ Input patient information into the analyzer system.
Manual Analysis (if applicable):
1. Pipetting:
◦ Pipette the required volume (as per the kit insert, typically
25-50 µL) of standards, quality controls, and patient serum
into the designated wells.
2. Assay Steps:
◦ Follow manufacturer-specific step-by-step instructions
precisely. This may include adding reagents (e.g., enzyme
conjugate, substrate solution), incubating samples at
specific temperatures, and washing steps.
3. Read Results:
◦ After the final step, measure the absorbance or
chemiluminescence using a microplate reader or dedicated
analyzer.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
• Assay quality control results must fall within the specified range
provided by the assay manufacturer. Document all quality control
results and corrective actions if results are out of range.
1. REPORTING RESULTS:
• Upon completion of the analytical procedure, review the results.
Ensure that results meet the criteria for validity set out by the
assay manufacturer.
• Enter validated results into the Laboratory Information System
(LIS).
• Flag any critical values and ensure that they are reviewed and
reported to the relevant healthcare provider in accordance with
laboratory protocols for critical results.
1. REFERENCE INTERVAL:
• Reference intervals should be those recommended by the assay
manufacturer, typically provided in the kit insert. Any deviations
from these values should be investigated and documented.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Carefully follow manufacturer instructions to avoid interference or
false results. Notable limitations in assays should be reviewed
from the insert and documented.
1. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If unexpected results are obtained or instrument errors occur,
review system error messages and refer to the operator manual.
• Repeat the analysis if necessary and document any procedural
adjustments or deviations.

assay kit used (e.g., Roche Cobas INSULIN insert, Abbott
Architect INSULIN insert, etc.).
