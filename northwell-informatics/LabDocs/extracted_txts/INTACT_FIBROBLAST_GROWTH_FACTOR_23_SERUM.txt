SOP for Intact Fibroblast Growth Factor 23 (FGF23) Quantitative
Analysis in Serum
1. PURPOSE:
The purpose of this Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is to
ensure that the measurement of serum Intact Fibroblast Growth
Factor 23 (FGF23) levels is performed accurately and reliably
according to established guidelines.
Responsibility:
Laboratory technologists are responsible for performing the analysis,
documenting the results, and ensuring that reporting is done
according to this procedure. Supervisors are responsible for
overseeing the process and resolving any issues that may arise.
1. PRINCIPLE:
Intact FGF23 is measured in serum samples using an enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit. The assay involves the binding of
serum FGF23 to a specific antibody, which is then detected and
quantified by a secondary antibody conjugated to an enzyme. The
resulting enzyme reaction produces a measurable color change,
which correlates with the concentration of FGF23 in the sample.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND HANDLING:
Preferred/Acceptable:
◦ 5 mL of serum obtained from a whole blood sample
collected in a serum separator tube (SST).
◦ Samples should be allowed to clot for 30 minutes and then
centrifuged at 1500xg for 10 minutes to separate the serum.
Unacceptable:
◦ Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric specimens.
◦ Specimens that have been subjected to multiple freeze-thaw
cycles.
Storage and Stability:
◦ Serum samples can be stored at 2-8°C for up to 7 days. For
long-term storage, aliquot and store at -20°C or lower for up
to 6 months.
2. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES:
◦ ELISA Kit for Intact FGF23 analysis (manufacturer specified,
e.g., Kainos Laboratories, Inc.)
◦ Microplate reader capable of measuring absorbance at
450nm and 600nm.
◦ Microcentrifuge tubes for aliquoting patient samples.
◦ Adjustable micropipettes and sterile pipette tips.
◦ Deionized water.
◦ Vortex mixer.
◦ Plate washer (optional, depending on the assay kit).
3. PROCEDURE:
Preparation:
◦ Allow all reagents and samples to reach room temperature
before starting the assay.
◦ Perform all procedures at room temperature unless
otherwise specified.
Assay Procedure:
1. Standard and Sample Preparation:
▪ Reconstitute the assay kit’s standards, controls, and
all reagents as per the manufacturer’s instructions.
▪ Dilute serum samples in provided assay buffer if
specified by manufacturer protocols.
2. Sample and Reagent Addition:
▪ Pipette required volume of standards, controls, and
samples into designated wells of the microtiter plate
following the manufacturer’s layout protocol.
▪ Add biotin-conjugated anti-FGF23 antibody to all wells.
▪ Incubate the plate according to kit instructions (e.g., 2
hours at room temperature).
3. Washing:
▪ Wash the plate using the plate washer or manually
according to manufacturer's instructions to remove
unbound substances.
4. Secondary Antibody Addition:
▪ Add streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate to
all wells and incubate for the specified time.
5. Substrate Addition:
▪ Add TMB (3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine) substrate
solution to all wells and incubate until color reaction
develops.
6. Stopping the Reaction:
▪ Add the stop solution to each well. The color will
change from blue to yellow.
7. Reading the Plate:
▪ Measure the absorbance of each well at 450 nm with
reference wavelength at 600 nm using a microplate
reader.
4. CALCULATIONS AND RESULT INTERPRETATION:
◦ Generate a standard curve by plotting the absorbance (Y-
axis) against the concentration of standards (X-axis).
◦ Use the standard curve to interpolate the concentrations of
FGF23 in the patient samples.
◦ Report results in pg/mL.
5. QUALITY CONTROL:
◦ Include quality control samples provided by the assay kit in
each run.
◦ Ensure that quality control results fall within the specified
range provided by the manufacturer.
◦ If QC results fall outside the acceptable range, do not report
patient results. Investigate the potential causes, retest
affected samples and controls, and consult with the
supervisor.
6. REPORTING RESULTS:
◦ Document results following laboratory standards.
◦ Results must be reviewed and verified by the technologist
before being reported into the laboratory information system
(LIS).
◦ Any critical results should be flagged according to laboratory
policy and reported immediately to the clinician.
7. REFERENCE INTERVALS:
◦ Follow the reference intervals provided in the assay kit
insert or established by the laboratory through validation
studies.
8. LIMITATIONS:
• Refer to the manufacturer’s kit insert for specific assay limitations
including interferences from other substances or conditions.

Note: This protocol must be reviewed and updated regularly to
ensure compliance with current standards and practices. All
technologists must be appropriately trained on this SOP before
performing the assay.
