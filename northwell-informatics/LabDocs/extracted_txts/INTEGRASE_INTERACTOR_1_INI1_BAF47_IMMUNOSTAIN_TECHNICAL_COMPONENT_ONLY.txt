Protocol for the Analytical Phase of Generating Results for INI1/
BAF47 Immunostain, Technical Component Only
1. PURPOSE
To outline the standard operating procedure (SOP) for the analytical
phase of generating technical immunostaining results for Integra
Interactor 1 (INI1/BAF47) in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded
(FFPE) tissue sections. This procedure ensures consistency and
accuracy in staining and documentation.
Responsibility:
• It is the responsibility of the laboratory technologists to perform
and document all steps involved in this procedure as outlined.
• It is the supervisor's responsibility to ensure protocols are
followed and to address deviations or technical issues.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Microtome
• Water Bath
• Oven (37°C)
• Xylene
• Ethanol (100%, 95%, 70%)
• Distilled Water
• Heat-induced Epitope Retrieval (HIER) solution (e.g., Citrate
Buffer, pH 6.0 or Tris-EDTA Buffer, pH 9.0)
• Ventana BenchMark XT or equivalent automated IHC stainer
• Primary Antibody: Anti-INI1/BAF47 (e.g., Cell Marque, Santa Cruz
Biotechnology)
• Secondary Antibody and Detection System (e.g., Ventana
OptiView DAB IHC Detection Kit)
• Control Slides: Known positive and negative controls for INI1/
BAF47
• Cover slips, mounting medium
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks or slides
with 3-5 µm sections mounted on charged slides.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Sectioning and Pre-treatment
1. Cut 3-5 µm sections from FFPE tissue blocks using the
microtome.
2. Place sections on charged slides, ensuring proper tissue
adhesion.
3. Dry slides in a 37°C oven overnight or at 60°C for 1-2 hours for
faster results.
B. Deparaffinization and Rehydration
1. Place slides in xylene for 2x5 minutes to remove paraffin.
2. Rehydrate slides by passing them through graded ethanol
solutions (100%, 95%, 70%) for 2 minutes each.
3. Rinse sections in distilled water.
C. Antigen Retrieval
1. Place slides in a pre-warmed retrieval solution (citrate buffer,
pH 6.0 or Tris-EDTA buffer, pH 9.0).
2. Perform heat-induced epitope retrieval using a water bath or
microwave for 20 minutes.
3. Allow slides to cool for 20 minutes at room temperature.
4. Rinse slides in distilled water followed by a buffer wash.
D. Immunostaining Using Automated IHC Stainer (e.g., Ventana
BenchMark XT)
1. Load slides onto the automated stainer and select the
appropriate protocol for INI1/BAF47.
2. Load primary antibody against INI1/BAF47 and detection
system reagents as per the manufacturer's instructions.
3. Start the automated staining run, which typically includes the
following steps: a. Incubation with primary antibody for 30-60
minutes. b. Washing steps. c. Incubation with secondary
antibody. d. Application of chromogenic substrate (e.g., DAB).
e. Counterstaining with hematoxylin.
E. Post-Staining Processing
1. Remove slides from the stainer and rinse in distilled water.
2. Dehydrate slides by passing through graded ethanol solutions
and clearing in xylene.
3. Mount slides with coverslips using a compatible mounting
medium.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
A. Control Slides
1. Include a known positive control (tissue known to express INI1/
BAF47) and a negative control for each staining run.
2. Review control slides to ensure staining quality and specificity.
B. Result Verification
1. Technologist should verify that the staining on the patient slides
is consistent with the control slides.
2. Any deviations or unexpected results must be reported to the
supervisor for further review and troubleshooting.
3. REPORTING RESULTS
• For the technical component, document the staining quality and
completion of the procedure. Results will be sent for interpretation
by a pathologist.
• Record all observations, including the staining intensity and
pattern, and any deviations encountered during staining.
1. DOCUMENTATION
• Ensure all records, including lot numbers for antibodies and
reagents, temperatures, times, and initials of technologists
performing the procedure, are properly documented in the
laboratory information system (LIS) or appropriate logbook.
