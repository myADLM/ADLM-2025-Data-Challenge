Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) INTERFERENCE
EVALUATION HETEROPHILE, BETA-HUMAN CHORIONIC
GONADOTROPIN, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
To provide a systematic procedure for the evaluation of interference
caused by heterophile antibodies in the measurement of beta-human
chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG) in serum samples using automated
immunoassay analyzers. This protocol ensures the generation of
reliable and accurate results, minimizing the risk of false positive or
false negative β-hCG readings that could impact clinical decisions.
1. SCOPE
This SOP applies to the analytical phase of testing β-hCG in serum
samples in the clinical laboratory.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all laboratory personnel performing β-hCG
testing to follow this procedure accurately and report any deviations
to the designated supervisor.
1. DEFINITION
β-hCG: A hormone produced by the placenta during pregnancy and
detected in blood to confirm pregnancy. Heterophile Antibodies:
Antibodies that can bind to assay antibodies leading to false results
in immunoassays.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Automated Immunoassay Analyzer
• β-hCG test kit
• Heterophile antibody blocking reagent (HBR)
• Calibrators and controls
• Serum samples
• Standard laboratory supplies
1. PROCEDURE
A) Sample Preparation
1. Collect serum sample following standard blood collection and
handling procedures.
2. Ensure proper labeling and documentation of samples received
for β-hCG testing.
B) Initial β-hCG Testing
1. Load the serum sample into the automated immunoassay
analyzer.
2. Perform the β-hCG test according to the manufacturer’s
protocol.
3. Record the β-hCG result in the laboratory information system
(LIS).
C) Evaluation for Heterophile Antibody Interference
1. If the β-hCG result is inconsistent with the clinical presentation
(e.g., unexpectedly high or low), evaluate for potential
heterophile antibody interference.
2. For the identified sample, add the heterophile antibody blocking
reagent (HBR) to an aliquot of the serum per the reagent’s
instructions.
3. Incubate the sample with HBR for the time specified by the
manufacturer.
4. Perform β-hCG re-testing on the treated sample using the same
automated immunoassay analyzer and protocol.
D) Interpretation and Reporting of Results
1. Compare the initial β-hCG result with the result after HBR
treatment:
◦ If there is a significant difference (greater than 20% change),
consider interference from heterophile antibodies.
◦ If the results are consistent (less than 20% change),
heterophile interference is unlikely.
2. Document both the initial and post-HBR treatment β-hCG
values and the observed percentage change.
3. Report the final interpreted β-hCG result in the LIS, noting any
interference evaluation conducted.
E) Quality Control
1. Run internal quality controls with each batch of samples.
2. Ensure that quality control results are within the acceptable
range before releasing patient results.
3. Document all quality control activities and any corrective
actions taken.
F) Corrective Actions
1. If any flagging, inconsistency, or anomaly is detected during
testing, reevaluate the sample after troubleshooting the
analyzer.
2. Report any persistent issues or uncertainties to the supervisor
for further investigation.
