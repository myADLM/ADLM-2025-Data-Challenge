1. PURPOSE
This procedure provides guidelines for the interference evaluation of
heterophile antibodies in thyroglobulin tumor marker testing in serum
specimens to ensure accuracy and reliability in the resulting data.
1. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all clinical laboratory personnel involved in
the assessment of thyroglobulin tumor markers and requires
interference evaluation for identifying potential heterophile antibodies
that might impact test results.
1. RESPONSIBILITY
All designated laboratory personnel are responsible for:
• Performing the interference evaluation procedure
• Documenting all findings
• Reporting results following this protocol
• Ensuring the accuracy of the analytical results
1. DEFINITIONS
Heterophile Antibodies: Antibodies that can interfere with
immunoassays by cross-linking assay components, leading to
erroneous analytical results.
Thyroglobulin (Tg): A tumor marker used in the follow-up and
monitoring of patients with differentiated thyroid cancer.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Calibrated micropipettes
• Sample tubes and vials
• Assay-specific reagents and controls
• Blocking (neutralizing) reagent for heterophile antibodies
• Thyroglobulin assay kits
• Analyzers used for thyroglobulin assays
• Laboratory timer/stop-watch
• Documented laboratory worksheets and logbooks
1. PROCEDURE
6.1 Specimen Criteria
6.1.1 Preferred/Acceptable Specimens:
• Serum samples collected and stored in SST tubes (serum
separator tubes)
• Specimens that are properly labeled with patient information and
collection time
6.1.2 Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens in non-serum collection tubes
• Specimens that show signs of hemolysis
• Specimens with fungal or bacterial contamination
6.2 Pre-Analytical Preparation
6.2.1 Specimen Handling:
• Ensure all specimens meet acceptance criteria before analysis.
• Centrifuge the SST tube for 10 minutes at 1000-2000 x g to
separate the serum.
6.2.2 Specimen Storage:
• Store serum at 2-8°C if not immediately analyzed.
• For long-term storage, freeze serum samples at -20°C or lower.
6.3 Analytical Procedure
6.3.1 Initial Test for Thyroglobulin:
• Analyze serum specimen using the thyroglobulin assay kit
according to the manufacturer's instructions.
• Document initial thyroglobulin values obtained.
6.3.2 Identification of Potential Interference:
• Before proceeding with the complete assay, evaluate the serum
sample for potential heterophile antibodies that might interfere
with the thyroglobulin measurement.
6.3.3 Heterophile Antibody Blocking (Neutralization):
• Use a heterophile antibody-blocking reagent to neutralize
potential interfering antibodies in a portion of the serum sample.
• Mix a predetermined amount of blocking reagent with an equal
volume of the serum sample per the blocking reagent's protocol.
• Incubate the mixture at room temperature for the recommended
incubation period, typically 1 hour.
6.3.4 Repeat Thyroglobulin Assay:
• After the incubation, centrifuge the treated serum samples at
1000-2000 x g for 10 minutes to remove any debris.
• Analyze the treated serum using the same thyroglobulin assay kit
as initially used.
• Document the thyroglobulin values obtained post-neutralization.
6.4 Results Analysis
6.4.1 Evaluate the Results:
• Compare the initial thyroglobulin values with the values obtained
after neutralization.
• Note any SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES, suggesting the
presence of interfering heterophile antibodies.
6.4.2 Interference Confirmation:
• Significant reduction in thyroglobulin values post-neutralization
indicates heterophile antibody interference; the initial result is
considered inaccurate.
• If the values are comparable, interference is unlikely, and the
initial result is considered accurate.
6.5 Reporting and Documentation:
6.5.1 Document all steps of the process, including:
• Initial thyroglobulin values, blocking reagent used, incubation
time, post-neutralization thyroglobulin values, and any notable
observations.
• Log all data in laboratory worksheets and the patient’s report
using site-specific guidelines.
6.5.2 Report Results:
• Accurate quantitative thyroglobulin values will be reported to the
physician, noting any interferences identified and corrected.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
7.1 Conducting Quality Control:
• Run quality control samples with known thyroglobulin levels with
each batch of patient specimens.
• Ensure these are within the manufacturer's prescribed ranges.
7.2 Recording and Review:
• Maintain a log of all quality control results and actions taken if
control samples are out of range.
• Supervisors must review the logs regularly to ensure compliance.
1. REFERENCE RANGES:
• Based on assay-specific manufacturer instructions and relevant
clinical guidelines.
