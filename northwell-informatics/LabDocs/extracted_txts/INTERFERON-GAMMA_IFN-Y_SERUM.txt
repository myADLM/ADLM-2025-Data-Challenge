Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Interferon-Gamma (IFN-γ) Serum Assays
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized protocol for the preparation, analysis,
interpretation, and validation of Interferon-Gamma (IFN-γ)
concentrations in serum samples. This ensures accurate, reliable,
and reproducible results in compliance with CLIA standards.
Responsibility: Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for
performing and documenting all steps of this procedure. Laboratory
supervisors are responsible for ensuring compliance and addressing
any issues that arise during the testing process.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND HANDLING
Specimen: - Collect specimen in a serum separator tube (SST). -
Allow the blood to clot at room temperature for 30 minutes. -
Centrifuge the sample at 1500-2000g for 10 minutes to separate
serum. - Transfer serum to a clean, labeled aliquot tube.
Storage: - Serum samples should be stored at 2-8°C if analyzed
within 72 hours. - If analysis will occur more than 72 hours after
collection, serum samples should be frozen at -20°C or colder. -
Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
Unacceptable Specimens: - Grossly hemolyzed, icteric, or lipemic
specimens. - Specimens not labeled with collection date/time and
patient identification.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
◦ ELISA microplate reader compatible with a 450 nm filter.
◦ Pipettes (single and multi-channel), pipette tips, and
microcentrifuge tubes.
◦ Interferon-Gamma (IFN-γ) ELISA kit (including standards,
detection antibodies, substrate solution, wash buffer, stop
solution).
◦ Plate washer or manual washing equipment.
◦ Precision balances, vortex mixer, and timer.
2. PROCEDURE
Preparation: - Bring all reagents and samples to room temperature
(20-25°C) prior to analysis. - Prepare wash buffer and other reagents
as per manufacturer’s instructions included in the ELISA kit.
Assay Protocol:
1. Label ELISA plate according to the layout plan. Include standards, controls, and unknown serum samples.
2. Add 50 µL of standards, controls, and unknown samples to the appropriate wells.
3. Add 50 µL of the detection antibody to each well.
4. Cover the plate with adhesive film and incubate at room temperature for 2 hours. Alternatively, follow the kit's specified incubation time.
5. Wash the plate 5 times with wash buffer, ensuring complete removal of wash buffer after the final wash.
6. Add 50 µL of the substrate solution to each well.
7. Incubate the plate in the dark at room temperature for 20-30 minutes, or until color development is satisfactory as per the kit's instructions.
8. Add 50 µL of stop solution to each well to terminate the reaction.
9. Read the absorbance at 450 nm using the microplate reader within 30 minutes.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
◦ Run controls (low, medium, high) with each assay batch to
ensure assay validity.
◦ The assay must meet the manufacturer’s quality control
specifications.
◦ If controls are out of range, repeat the assay or investigate
potential issues before reporting results.
2. CALCULATION OF RESULTS
◦ Generate a standard curve by plotting the absorbance
values of standards against their known concentrations.
◦ Determine the concentration of IFN-γ in the unknown
samples from the standard curve.
3. REPORTING RESULTS
◦ Report IFN-γ concentrations in pg/mL or as specified by
clinical requirements.
◦ Ensure all results are reviewed and validated by the
technologist before being transmitted to the Laboratory
Information System (LIS).
4. SAMPLE INTEGRITY AND VALIDATION
◦ Inspect sample integrity visually and document any
hemolysis, icterus, or lipemia.
◦ Validate test results by comparing them against controls and
reviewing assay performance metrics (e.g., standard curve
R^2 values).
5. LIMITATIONS AND INTERFERENCES
◦ Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples may interfere with
the assay.
◦ Limitations are detailed in the ELISA kit insert; always refer
to this for assay-specific limitations.
