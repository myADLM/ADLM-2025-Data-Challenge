Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Generating Results for
INTERFERON GAMMA RELEASE ASSAY (T-SPOT TB)
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to provide a standardized procedure for
performing the Interferon Gamma Release Assay (T-SPOT TB) to
detect immune response in individuals suspected of having
Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. This SOP ensures the
accurate, reliable, and reproducible generation of test results.
Responsibility:
• It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory staff to perform
the T-SPOT TB assay according to this procedure and ensure
accurate documentation of results.
• It is the responsibility of all laboratory personnel to report any
conditions that may affect the assay's outcome to a supervisor
promptly.
2. PRINCIPLE
The T-SPOT TB assay detects the release of interferon gamma (IFN-
γ) by sensitized T cells when exposed to specific M. tuberculosis
antigens. Blood samples are processed to isolate peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (PBMCs), which are then incubated with antigens.
Spots, representing individual cells releasing IFN-γ, are counted and
interpreted.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
• Specimen Type: Whole blood collected in lithium heparin tubes.
• Volume: Minimum of 8 mL (4 mL in each of two tubes).
• Stability: Blood samples should be processed within 8 hours of
collection at room temperature.
4. REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
• T-SPOT TB assay kit (including antigens ESAT-6 and CFP-10,
control antigens, and reagents)
• PBMC isolation reagents (Ficoll-Paque or equivalent)
• 96-well ELISPOT plates
• Plate washer and ELISPOT reader
• Incubator, maintained at 37°C with 5% CO2
• Hemocytometer or automated cell counter
• Pipettes and sterile pipette tips
• Sterile 15 mL and 50 mL centrifuge tubes
• Sterile PBS (Phosphate-Buffered Saline)
5. EQUIPMENT
• Centrifuge (swing-bucket rotor) capable of maintaining proper G-
force for cell separation.
• Biological safety cabinet (Class II).
• Incubator (37°C, 5% CO2).
• Automated ELISPOT reader.
6. PROCEDURE
A. PBMC Isolation:
1. Label 50 mL conical centrifuge tubes with patient/sample
identification.
2. Transfer whole blood into tubes containing PBMC isolation
reagent.
3. Centrifuge at 800 x g for 20 minutes at room temperature with
brake off.
4. Carefully aspirate the PBMC layer and transfer to new 15 mL
tubes.
5. Wash PBMCs with sterile PBS, centrifuge at 400 x g for 10
minutes.
6. Resuspend cells in sterile PBS and determine cell count.
B. Plate Preparation:
1. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions to coat wells of the
ELISPOT plate with capture antibody.
2. Add 250,000 PBMCs in 100 μL to each well.
◦ Use separate wells for ESAT-6, CFP-10, positive control,
and negative control.
3. Incubate plates overnight (16-20 hours) at 37°C with 5% CO2.
C. Detection:
1. After incubation, discard the supernatant and wash plates as
per manufacturer’s protocol.
2. Add detection antibodies and incubate as instructed.
3. Wash plates.
4. Develop spots using substrate provided in the kit.
5. Stop the reaction as per manufacturer’s guidance.
D. Spot Counting:
1. Dry plates and read within the specified time frame using an
automated ELISPOT reader.
2. Count and document the number of spots per well. Each spot
represents a T cell releasing IFN-γ.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Perform internal controls (positive and negative) with each assay
run.
• Use calibrators and verify instrument precision as described in the
manufacturer's instructions.
• Record all quality control activities in the QC log.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Calculate results by subtracting the number of spots in the
negative control well from those in antigen wells.
• Interpret the results according to T-SPOT TB assay guidelines
(e.g., positive, negative, indeterminate).
• Ensure all results are reviewed and verified before reporting to
Electronic Medical Records (EMR).
9. SAMPLE INTEGRITY
• Review sample for clots and appropriate volume. Defer testing if
the sample shows signs of clotting or insufficient volume.
• If PBMC recovery is low, document and notify the supervisor.
10. CRITICAL RESULTS
• Promptly notify the clinician if a result meets the critical value
threshold as defined by laboratory policy.

12. RECORDS AND DOCUMENTATION
• Maintain records of all assays performed, including sample
information, results, quality controls, and any deviations from
protocol.
• Store documentation according to regulatory and institutional
retention policies.
