Standard Operating Procedure for the Analytical Phase of
Immunostaining for Interferon Regulatory Factor 8 (IRF8),
Technical Component Only
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the analytical procedures
required for the immunostaining of Interferon Regulatory Factor 8
(IRF8) in clinical specimens. The technical component focuses solely
on the histochemical processes, excluding any interpretive reporting.
Responsibility:
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing the
immunostaining according to this protocol. The laboratory supervisor
will ensure compliance with this SOP and address any necessary
corrective actions.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/Acceptable Specimens:
• Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue sections.
• Optimal section thickness: 4 μm.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Microtome
• Water bath
• Positive charged microscope slides
• Drying oven
• Xylene
• Ethanol series (100%, 95%, 70% ethanol)
• Distilled water
• Antigen retrieval system (e.g., microwave or pressure cooker)
• Citrate buffer (pH 6.0) or other appropriate antigen retrieval
solution
• Blocking solution
• Primary antibody against IRF8
• Appropriate secondary antibody conjugated to a detection
enzyme or fluorophore
• DAB substrate kit or appropriate chromogen (for enzymatic
detection)
• Mounting medium
• Coverslips
• Hematoxylin for counterstaining (if needed)
1. PROCEDURE
A) Deparaffinization and Rehydration:
1. Section FFPE tissue blocks using a microtome to obtain 4 μm
sections.
2. Float sections in a 40-45°C water bath, then transfer to
positively charged slides.
3. Place slides in a drying oven at 60°C for 1 hour or overnight at
37°C to ensure proper adherence.
4. Deparaffinize sections in xylene for three changes at 5 minutes
each.
5. Rehydrate sections in a graded ethanol series (100%, 95%,
and 70%) for 2 minutes each, followed by rinsing in distilled
water.
B) Antigen Retrieval:
1. Place slides in an antigen retrieval solution (e.g., 10 mM citrate
buffer, pH 6.0).
2. Heat sections in a microwave or pressure cooker for 15-20
minutes.
3. Allow slides to cool at room temperature for 20 minutes, then
rinse in distilled water.
C) Blocking:
1. Incubate slides with blocking solution to prevent non-specific
binding for 10-15 minutes at room temperature.
2. Rinse slides with PBS or appropriate washing buffer.
D) Primary Antibody Incubation:
1. Incubate sections with the primary antibody against IRF8,
diluted according to the manufacturer's instructions, for 30-60
minutes at room temperature or overnight at 4°C.
2. Rinse slides in PBS or washing buffer, 3 changes for 5 minutes
each.
E) Secondary Antibody Incubation:
1. Apply the secondary antibody conjugated with an enzyme (e.g.,
HRP) or fluorophore for 30 minutes at room temperature.
2. Rinse slides in PBS or washing buffer, 3 changes for 5 minutes
each.
F) Detection:
1. For enzyme-conjugated secondary antibodies, apply DAB
substrate or appropriate chromogen according to the
manufacturer's instructions and incubate until the desired color
development is achieved.
2. Rinse sections in distilled water.
G) Counterstaining:
1. Counterstain sections with hematoxylin for 1-2 minutes (if
needed).
2. Rinse sections in running tap water, then in distilled water.
H) Dehydration and Mounting:
1. Dehydrate sections through graded ethanol (70%, 95%, 100%)
for 2 minutes each.
2. Clear sections in xylene for two changes at 5 minutes each.
3. Mount sections with mounting medium and apply coverslips.
4. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include a positive control slide known to express IRF8 and a
negative control slide (no primary antibody) with each batch to
ensure staining efficacy and specificity.
• Document all steps performed, including incubation times,
reagent lot numbers, and any deviations from the protocol.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Stained slides are to be provided to the pathologist for analysis
and interpretation.
• Ensure that results are submitted promptly and accurately
recorded in the laboratory's information system.
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS

limitations.
