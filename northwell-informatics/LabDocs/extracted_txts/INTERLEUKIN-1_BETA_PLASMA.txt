Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Interleukin-1 Beta (IL-1β) in Plasma
1. PURPOSE
This SOP outlines the procedures required for accurately measuring
the concentration of Interleukin-1 Beta (IL-1β) in plasma samples
using an Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). The goal is
to ensure precise, consistent, and reliable results that meet clinical
and research standards.
2. RESPONSIBILITIES
Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for following this
SOP when processing and analyzing plasma samples for IL-1β. The
laboratory supervisor must ensure that all staff members are properly
trained and that quality control measures are strictly adhered to.
3. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
3.1. Sample Type:
• Preferred: Plasma extracted from EDTA-treated blood.
• Volume: Minimum 500 µL of plasma is required for analysis.
• Storage: Plasma samples should be frozen at -20°C or colder
immediately after separation and can be stored for up to six
months.
3.2. Unacceptable Samples:
• Whole blood samples.
• Plasma samples collected in tubes other than EDTA.
• Samples that show signs of hemolysis, contamination, or
improper handling.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• ELISA kit specific for human IL-1β (refer to manufacturer’s
guidelines for specific kit requirements).
• Microplate reader capable of measuring absorbance at
appropriate wavelengths (typically 450 nm with a reference
wavelength of 570 nm or 630 nm).
• Micropipettes and sterile pipette tips.
• Plate washer (optional but recommended for consistent results).
• Calibrated centrifuge.
• Reagent reservoirs and disposable tubes.
5. PROCEDURE
5.1. Preparation:
• Thaw plasma samples on ice and mix gently. Avoid repeated
freeze-thaw cycles.
• Prepare ELISA reagents, standards, and controls as per the
manufacturer's instructions.
• Ensure all equipment, particularly pipettes and plate readers, are
calibrated and in proper working order.
5.2. Assay Setup:
1. Label microtiter plate wells according to the layout provided in
the ELISA kit insert.
2. Add 50-100 µL of standards, controls, and plasma samples into
the respective wells.
3. Follow the ELISA kit's instructions for adding reagents (e.g.,
detection antibodies, HRP-conjugates).
4. Incubate the plate for specified times at room temperature or
as directed. Cover the plate to avoid evaporation and
contamination.
5. Wash the plate as per the kit instructions. It is crucial to remove
any unbound material to reduce background noise.
5.3. Detection:
1. Add the substrate solution to each well as directed. Incubate
for the specified period to allow the color to develop.
2. Stop the reaction by adding the stop solution provided in the
kit.
3. Read the absorbance of each well at 450 nm with a reference
filter (570 nm or 630 nm) using a microplate reader.
6. DATA ANALYSIS
• Calculate the concentration of IL-1β in each sample based on the
standard curve generated by plotting the known concentrations of
the standards against their respective absorbance values.
• Ensure that all quality control samples fall within the expected
concentration ranges. Rerun any assays if control values are out
of range.
7. QUALITY CONTROL
• Include at least two levels of control (low and high) with each
batch of assays.
• Repeat any samples that produce questionable results (e.g.,
those that fall outside the standard curve or show extreme
variability).
• Maintain records of all assay runs, including standard curves,
control results, and any deviations or issues encountered.
8. REPORTING RESULTS
• Record the results in the laboratory information system.
• Review and verify the results by a qualified technologist before
releasing.
• Report critical results immediately to the requesting physician or
investigator.
9. REFERENCES
• Manufacturer's instructions and guidelines for the specific IL-1β
ELISA kit used.
• Laboratory quality control and assurance policies.
• Relevant literature on the measurement of cytokines in plasma by
ELISA.
10. DOCUMENTATION
All procedures, calculations, and observations should be thoroughly
documented in the instrument logbook and the laboratory information
system. Ensure that the documentation includes the date, time,
analyst's initials, and any relevant observations or deviations from
standard procedures.
11. TROUBLESHOOTING
Refer to the kit insert and troubleshooting guides provided by the
ELISA kit manufacturer for resolving common issues related to assay
performance.
