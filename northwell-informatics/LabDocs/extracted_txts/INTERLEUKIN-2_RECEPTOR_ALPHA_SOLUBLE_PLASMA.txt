Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase:
Interleukin-2 Receptor Alpha Soluble (sIL-2Rα), Plasma
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for the analysis of Interleukin-2 Receptor
Alpha Soluble (sIL-2Rα) in plasma samples using an Enzyme-Linked
Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). Ensure accurate and reliable
measurement, facilitate proper documentation, and address quality
control for the assay.
Responsibility:
• It is the responsibility of designated laboratory staff to perform the
analysis, document results, and report any deviations.
• Supervisors must review and validate the assay performance,
ensuring that all documentation is complete and corrective actions
are implemented when necessary.
2. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/Acceptable Specimens:
• Plasma collected in EDTA vacutainer tubes.
• Specimens should be centrifuged within 30 minutes of collection
at 1500 x g for 10 minutes at 4°C.
• Plasma aliquots should be immediately frozen at -80°C until
analysis.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens that have been stored at room temperature for more
than 2 hours.
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric specimens.
• Specimens that have been subjected to repeated freeze-thaw
cycles.
3. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• ELISA kit specific for sIL-2Rα.
• Microplate reader capable of reading at 450 nm (reference
620-690 nm).
• Micropipettes and tips.
• Plate washer.
• Laboratory timer.
• Calibrated centrifuge.
4. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Equilibrate all reagents, specimens, and controls to room
temperature (20-25°C) before use.
2. Prepare the required number of wells in the microplate for
standards, controls, and samples.
Standard Curve Preparation:
1. Reconstitute, if needed, and serially dilute standards as per the
kit instructions.
2. Label the tubes for the standard dilutions.
Assay Procedure:
1. Add 100 µL of standards, controls, and samples to their
respective wells.
2. Add 100 µL of biotinylated detection antibody to each well and
incubate at room temperature for 1 hour with gentle shaking.
3. Wash the plate 4 times with wash buffer using the plate washer.
4. Add 100 µL of enzyme-conjugated streptavidin to each well and
incubate at room temperature for 30 minutes with gentle
shaking.
5. Wash the plate 4 times with wash buffer.
6. Add 100 µL of TMB substrate solution to each well and incubate
in the dark at room temperature for 15-30 minutes.
7. Add 50 µL of stop solution to each well, ensuring thorough
mixing by gently tapping the plate.
8. Read the plate at 450 nm with a reference wavelength at
620-690 nm using the microplate reader.
Quality Control:
1. Include internal QC materials at the high and low
concentrations in each batch.
2. Review and document QC results to ensure they fall within
acceptable ranges before proceeding with patient results.
3. Implement corrective actions as necessary for QC deviations.
5. ANALYSIS AND REPORTING RESULTS
Data Analysis:
1. Generate the standard curve by plotting the mean absorbance
for each standard on the y-axis against concentration on the x-
axis.
2. Determine the concentration of sIL-2Rα in plasma samples and
controls based on the standard curve using appropriate
software or calculation methods.
Reporting Results:
1. Transmit results to the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
2. Review each result for consistency and validity; verify results
against QC data.
3. Report results in pg/mL (or other units as specified) ensuring
appropriate chart comments for any sample integrity concerns.
Reference Intervals:
• The normal reference range for sIL-2Rα in plasma should be
provided with kit inserts or determined through internal validation
studies.
6. LIMITATIONS AND INTERPRETATION
Refer to the ELISA kit insert for:
• Cross-reactivity, interference, and assay sensitivity.
• Potential limitations in the presence of high background or non-
specific binding.
