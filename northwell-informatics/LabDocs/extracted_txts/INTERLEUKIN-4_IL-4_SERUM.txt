Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for INTERLEUKIN-4 (IL-4)
Serum Testing
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to outline the procedure for the
quantitative measurement of Interleukin-4 (IL-4) in serum samples.
The results provide important clinical information for the diagnosis
and monitoring of conditions such as allergies, autoimmune
diseases, and other inflammatory disorders.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of the designated laboratory staff to follow this
procedure accurately and to adhere to all quality control measures
outlined.
2. DEFINITION
Interleukin-4 (IL-4) is a cytokine produced by activated T cells, mast
cells, and basophils that plays a key role in regulating the immune
response.
3. SPECIMEN
Preferred / Acceptable Specimens:
• 5 mL of venous blood collected in a serum separator tube (SST).
• Blood must be allowed to clot for 30 minutes at room temperature
before centrifugation.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens collected in anticoagulant tubes (e.g., EDTA, heparin).
• Hemolyzed or lipemic specimens.
• Specimens that are not properly labelled with patient identification
and collection date/time.
Specimen Stability:
• Serum specimens should be stored at 2 - 8°C and are stable up
to 48 hours post-collection.
• For longer storage, aliquot serum into cryovials and freeze at
-20°C or lower. Frozen specimens are stable for up to 1 year.
4. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:

• Microplate washer
Reagents:
• IL-4 ELISA kit (commercially available)
• Calibrators / Standards
• Controls (negative and positive)
• Wash buffer
• Substrate solution
• Stop solution
Supplies:
• Disposable gloves
• Pipette tips

5. PROCEDURE
Sample Preparation:
1. Centrifuge the SST at 1500 x g for 10 minutes.
2. Carefully transfer the serum into a new microcentrifuge tube.
3. Store serum at 2 - 8°C or freeze if not analyzed within 48 hours.
ELISA Procedure:
1. Allow reagents, samples, and controls to come to room
temperature before testing.
2. Prepare standards, controls, and samples according to the kit
insert.
3. Add 50 µL of prepared standards, controls, and samples into
the respective wells of the microplate.
4. Add 50 µL of the detection antibody to each well. Incubate the
plate for 1 hour at room temperature.
5. Wash the plate 5 times using the provided wash buffer or a
microplate washer.
6. Add 100 µL of the substrate solution to each well. Incubate for
20-30 minutes at room temperature, protected from light.
7. Add 50 µL of stop solution to each well.
8. Read the absorbance at 450 nm using an ELISA reader.
Quality Control:
• Run positive and negative controls with each assay to ensure the
validity of results.
• Plot a standard curve and calculate IL-4 concentrations in the
samples based on this curve.
• Ensure all controls fall within the manufacturer stated acceptable
range.
6. REPORTING RESULTS
• Results are automatically transmitted to the Laboratory
Information System (LIS) and reviewed by the technologist.
• Results must be verified for accuracy before release.
• Critical values should be reported to the attending physician
according to site-specific protocol.
Reference Interval:
• Refer to the ELISA kit insert for the specific reference intervals for
IL-4.
7. SAMPLE INTEGRITY
• Assess samples for hemolysis, lipemia, and other integrity issues.
• Use best judgment when reporting results for compromised
samples.
8. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Refer to the specific ELISA kit insert for limitations associated with
the assay.
• Ensure samples are free from contamination and properly stored
to avoid false results.
