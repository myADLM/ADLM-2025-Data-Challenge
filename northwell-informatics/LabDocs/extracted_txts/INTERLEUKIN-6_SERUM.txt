Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Interleukin-6 (IL-6)
Serum Analysis
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for the accurate measurement and reporting
of Interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels in serum samples.
RESPONSIBILITY:
• Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for performing,
monitoring, and documenting the IL-6 analysis.
• Laboratory personnel must follow this protocol closely to ensure
the accuracy and reliability of the results.
• Any deviation from this protocol must be immediately reported to
the supervisor.
1. DEFINITION
Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a cytokine involved in inflammation and the
maturation of B cells. Elevated IL-6 levels can be indicative of acute
and chronic inflammation, immune response disorders, and various
diseases.
1. SPECIMEN
Specimen Type:
• Serum
Collection and Handling:
• Preferred/Acceptable:
◦ 5 mL of blood collected into a serum separator tube (SST).
◦ The serum should be separated from the clotted blood within 2
hours of collection and stored at 2-8°C if not analyzed
immediately.
• Unacceptable:
◦ Hemolyzed samples.
◦ Samples with improper labeling.
◦ Samples collected in tubes containing anticoagulants.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• ELISA Reader or chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA)
analyzer.
• IL-6 ELISA or CLIA kit (from a reputable supplier, e.g., R&D
Systems, Bio-Techne, etc.).
• Micropipettes and appropriate tips.
• Calibrated microplate washer.
• Laboratory incubator (37°C).
• Centrifuge.
• Personal protective equipment (PPE) including gloves, lab coat,
and safety goggles.
• Standard laboratory supplies (test tubes, racks, etc.).
1. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
1. Ensure that all reagents and samples are brought to room
temperature before use (20-25°C) unless specified otherwise
by the kit insert.
2. Prepare reagents and standards according to the
manufacturer's instructions included with the ELISA or CLIA kit.
Assay Procedure:
A. ELISA Method:
1. Add 50-100 µL of standards, controls, and patient serum
samples to the appropriate wells of an IL-6 ELISA plate.
2. Add the appropriate volume of the IL-6 detecting antibody to
each well (refer to the kit insert).
3. Incubate the plate for 1-2 hours at 37°C (or as specified by the
kit insert).
4. Wash the plate to remove unbound substances using an
automated microplate washer.
5. Add substrate solution to each well and incubate as specified
by the kit instructions (typically 20-30 minutes at room
temperature in the dark).
6. Stop the reaction by adding stop solution to each well.
7. Read the optical density (OD) at 450 nm using a microplate
reader.
B. CLIA Method:
1. Load the prepared serum samples, standards, and controls into
the sample positions of the CLIA analyzer.
2. Ensure that reagent cartridges are loaded correctly and that the
analyzer is calibrated.
3. Run the analysis based on the programmed IL-6 assay protocol
provided by the CLIA analyzer.
4. Review and validate the run using the system QC reports.
5. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run the internal quality controls with each batch of samples.
• Use two levels of controls (low and high) to ensure assay
performance.
• Validate results only if the QC results fall within the acceptable
range. Repeat the assay if QC fails.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• The IL-6 concentration in each sample is calculated using a
standard curve generated from the OD readings of the known
standards.
• Results are typically expressed in pg/mL or other appropriate
units.
• All results must be double-checked for accuracy and entered into
the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
1. REFERENCE INTERVALS
• Reference intervals may vary according to the population studied.
Typical reference intervals should be provided by the kit
manufacturer or established in-house based on a validated study.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
• Hemolyzed or lipemic samples may affect the accuracy of the
result.
• Cross-reactivity with other cytokines or substances may cause
interference.
• Refer to the ELISA or CLIA kit insert for further limitations of the
assay.
