Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Interleukin-8 (IL-8) Serum
Analysis
1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for the detection and
quantification of Interleukin-8 (IL-8) in serum samples using enzyme-
linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or a similar analytical method.
This protocol ensures accurate and reproducible results.
Responsibility:
• Designated laboratory staff and technologists are responsible for
performing the analysis and ensuring adherence to the protocol.
• Supervisors are responsible for training staff, overseeing the
implementation of the SOP, and addressing any discrepancies or
issues that arise.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Specimen Type:
• Serum
Specimen Collection and Handling:
• Preferred: 5 mL of blood collected in a serum separator tube
(SST).
• Allow blood to clot for 30 minutes at room temperature before
centrifugation.
• Centrifuge the sample at 1500 x g for 10 minutes at 4°C.
Specimen Storage:
• Serum must be aliquoted into labeled cryovials.
• Store serum samples at -80°C if not analyzed immediately.
• Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
Unacceptable Specimens:
• Specimens with visible hemolysis or lipemia.
• Specimens collected in tubes containing anticoagulants (e.g.,
EDTA, heparin).
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
Equipment:
• Microplate reader capable of measuring absorbance at 450 nm
and 570 nm (optional for wavelength correction).
• Microplate washer.
• Calibrated pipettes and tips.
• Centrifuge.
Reagents:
• Interleukin-8 (IL-8) ELISA kit (including standards, controls, and
reagents as provided by the manufacturer).
• Deionized or distilled water.
Supplies:
• Microplates (included in the ELISA kit).
• Cryovials for serum storage.
• Personal protective equipment (e.g., gloves, lab coat, safety
goggles).
1. PROCEDURE
A. Preparing Reagents
• Prepare all reagents, standards, and samples as instructed by the
ELISA kit manufacturer.
• Equilibrate all reagents and specimens to room temperature
before use.
B. Assay Procedure
1. Add 100 µL of standards, controls, and serum samples to the
appropriate wells of the microplate.
2. Add 100 µL of the detection antibody to each well.
3. Incubate the plate for 2 hours at room temperature with
agitation.
4. Aspirate and wash the wells 5 times with 300 µL of wash buffer.
Ensure complete removal of washing solution at each wash
step.
5. Add 100 µL of enzyme conjugate to each well.
6. Incubate the plate for 1 hour at room temperature with agitation.
7. Aspirate and wash the wells 5 times with 300 µL of wash buffer.
8. Add 100 µL of TMB substrate solution to each well.
9. Incubate the plate in the dark for 15-30 minutes at room
temperature.
10. Add 100 µL of stop solution to each well.
11. Measure the absorbance at 450 nm within 30 minutes using a
microplate reader.
C. Calculation of Results
• Plot the standard curve using a linear regression or polynomial fit
model from the absorbance values of the standards.
• Calculate the IL-8 concentrations in the serum samples from the
standard curve.
• If the sample absorbance values exceed the highest standard,
dilute the samples and re-assay.
1. QUALITY CONTROL
• Run quality control samples provided by the ELISA kit
manufacturer with each batch of patient specimens.
• Accept results only if the quality control samples fall within the
manufacturer's specified range.
• Document all quality control data including any deviations or
corrective actions taken.
1. REPORTING RESULTS
• Enter IL-8 concentration results into the Laboratory Information
System (LIS).
• Review and verify results ensuring they are within the reportable
range specified by the assay.
• Report critical results promptly following the established
laboratory protocol for critical values.
1. SAFETY AND PRECAUTIONS
• Handle all specimens and reagents as potential biohazards.
• Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) at all
times.
• Follow all institutional guidelines for waste disposal and spill
handling.
