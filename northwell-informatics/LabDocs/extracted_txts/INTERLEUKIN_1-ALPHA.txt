Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Interleukin 1-Alpha (IL-1α)
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this procedure is to outline the steps required for the
analysis and reporting of Interleukin 1-Alpha (IL-1α) levels in patient
samples. This protocol ensures consistency, accuracy, and reliability
of the results.
2. SCOPE
This SOP applies to all medical laboratory personnel conducting
IL-1α analysis in the laboratory.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
Staff who are trained in IL-1α analysis are responsible for performing
the test and adhering to this procedure. It is the responsibility of
laboratory supervisors to ensure ongoing compliance and to address
any issues that arise during the analysis.
4. EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS
• ELISA (Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay) Reader
• Microplate washer
• Precision pipettes (single and multichannel) and tips
• Centrifuge capable of 1500 x g
• Refrigerated storage for reagents
• IL-1α ELISA kit (reference standard, capture antibody, detection
antibody, substrate solution, wash buffer, stop solution)
• Calibrated traceable thermometer
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
• Deionized water
5. DEFINITION
Interleukin 1-Alpha (IL-1α) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine involved in
immune response regulation and is measured using the ELISA
method in this protocol.
6. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation
1. Specimen: Serum or plasma with EDTA, citrate, or heparin.
Preferably freshly collected.
2. Volume Required: Minimum of 1 mL.
3. Storage: Samples must be stored at 2-8°C if analysis will be
performed within 24 hours. If longer storage is needed, samples
should be frozen at -20°C or -80°C.
4. Thawing: Ensure completely thaw and mix well before
analysis. Avoid repeated freeze/thaw cycles.
B. Reagent Preparation
1. Standard Preparation: Reconstitute and serially dilute as per
the manufacturer’s instructions to generate a standard curve.
2. Preparation of Solutions: Prepare wash buffer, substrate
solution, and stop solution as per the kit instructions. Ensure
solutions are at room temperature before use.
C. Assay Procedure
1. Plate Setup:
◦ Pipette 100 µL of standards, samples, and quality controls
into the appropriate wells in duplicates.
2. Addition of Detection Antibodies:
◦ Add 100 µL of prepared detection antibody into each well.
3. Incubation:
◦ Cover the plate with adhesive strip and incubate at room
temperature (20-25°C) for 2 hours.
4. Washing:
◦ Wash the plate using the microplate washer following the kit
instructions. Repeat the wash step 5 times.
5. Substrate Addition:
◦ Add 100 µL of substrate solution to each well. Incubate at
room temperature for 20-30 minutes in the dark.
6. Stopping the Reaction:
◦ Add 50 µL of stop solution to each well. The color changes
from blue to yellow.
7. Reading the Plate:
◦ Immediately measure the absorbance at 450 nm using the
ELISA reader.
D. Calculation of Results
1. Standard Curve: Generate a standard curve from the
absorbance values of the standard samples using a 4-
parameter logistic regression.
2. Sample Concentration: Use the standard curve to determine
the IL-1α concentration in patient samples.
3. Quality Control: Verify that the controls are within the
established acceptable ranges. If any control fails, repeat the
analysis for the entire batch.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
1. Review generated results for consistency.
2. Validate results in the Laboratory Information System (LIS) as
per laboratory protocols.
3. Results should be reported in pg/mL with reference ranges
provided.
8. QUALITY CONTROL
1. Include quality control samples (negative and positive) in each
run.
2. Perform routine calibration and maintenance of ELISA reader
and other laboratory equipment.
3. Participate in external quality assessment (EQA) schemes for
IL-1α periodically.
9. REFERENCE INTERVALS
Adult Range:
• Normal: <5 pg/mL
• Elevated: ≥5 pg/mL
Pediatric Range: (Refer to site-specific guidelines or literature for
age-related reference ranges)
10. TROUBLESHOOTING
• If high background or inconsistent readings occur, ensure all wells
are washed completely and check for possible contamination.
• If poor standard curve fitting occurs, ensure correct preparation
and serial dilution of standards.
