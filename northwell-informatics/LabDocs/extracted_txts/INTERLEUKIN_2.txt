SOP: Analysis of Interleukin-2 (IL-2)
1. PURPOSE: To provide a standardized procedure for the
accurate and efficient analysis of Interleukin-2 (IL-2) in human
serum or plasma samples using an enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
Responsibility: Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for
performing the analysis and adhering to the procedures and
guidelines set forth in this SOP. It is the responsibility of all staff to
record and report any deviations from the SOP to a supervisor. Staff
and supervisors must ensure accurate performance and
documentation of the results, including any corrective actions taken.
1. DEFINITION: Interleukin-2 (IL-2) is a cytokine signaling
molecule that plays a central role in the regulation of the
immune system.
2. PROCEDURE:
A) EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES:
1. ELISA Reader or Plate Reader capable of measuring
absorbance at 450 nm.
2. Wash bottle or automated plate washer.
3. Microtiter plate (96 wells) pre-coated with anti-IL-2 antibody.
4. Standard IL-2 for calibration curve.
5. Serum or plasma samples from patients.
6. Assay buffer, reagents, and other necessary solutions provided
with the IL-2 ELISA kit.
7. Timer.
8. Pipettes and disposable tips (2 μL –1000 μL).
9. Disposable gloves, lab coat, and safety glasses.
10. Absorbent paper.
11. Calibration and control materials, as per the ELISA kit protocol.
B) SAMPLE HANDLING:
1. Prior to analysis, ensure samples are well-mixed, avoiding
frothing.
2. Centrifuge samples at 1500 x g for 10 minutes, if necessary, to
remove particulates.
3. Store samples at 2-8°C if analyzing within 24 hours or freeze at
-20°C (-80°C for long term storage) for later analysis.
4. Thaw frozen samples and bring to room temperature (20-25°C)
prior to analysis. Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles as it may
affect the IL-2 concentration.
C) ASSAY PROCEDURE:
1. Allow reagents and samples to reach room temperature before
starting the assay.
2. Prepare standard IL-2 solutions and quality control samples as
per the kit instructions.
3. Add 100 μL of each standard, sample, and control to the
appropriate wells of the pre-coated assay plate.
4. Add 50 μL of the biotinylated IL-2 antibody to each well and mix
gently.
5. Cover the plate with adhesive film and incubate at room
temperature for 2 hours.
6. Wash the plate 4 times with 300 μL of wash buffer per well,
ensuring complete removal of liquid at each step.
7. Add 100 μL of HRP-Streptavidin solution to each well and cover
the plate with adhesive film.
8. Incubate the plate at room temperature for 30 minutes.
9. Wash the plate 4 times as described earlier.
10. Add 100 μL of tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate solution to
each well and cover the plate to avoid exposure to light.
11. Incubate at room temperature for 15-30 minutes or until a
sufficient color change is observed.
12. Add 50 μL of stop solution to each well to stop the reaction. The
color should change from blue to yellow.
13. Read the absorbance at 450 nm within 30 minutes using an
ELISA reader.
D) CALIBRATION AND QUALITY CONTROLS:
1. Construct the standard curve by plotting the mean absorbance
for each standard concentration (x-axis) against the
corresponding concentration of IL-2 (y-axis).
2. Determine the IL-2 concentration of samples and controls from
the standard curve.
3. Analyze quality control samples to ensure the accuracy and
precision of the assay. QC results should fall within predefined
acceptable ranges.
E) REPORTING RESULTS:
1. Manually or electronically record absorbance values obtained
from the ELISA reader.
2. Calculate the concentration of IL-2 in each sample using the
standard curve created.
3. Report IL-2 concentration in pg/mL. Ensure to note any
deviations or interferences observed during the analysis and
document accordingly.
F) CRITICAL VALUES: Results falling outside the assay’s reportable
range should be retested or diluted where applicable and
recalculated. Report any critical values as determined by the
laboratory’s guidelines.
1. QUALITY CONTROL REQUIREMENTS:
2. Perform a minimum of two levels of controls with each assay
run (high and low IL-2 concentrations).
3. Evaluate assay performance using quality control materials and
compare against acceptable range limits.
4. Document and investigate any out-of-range QC results; take
corrective actions if necessary.
5. REFERENCES: Refer to the ELISA kit manufacturer’s product
insert provided with the IL-2 ELISA kit for detailed reagent
preparation, assay procedure, and any specific limitations or
considerations.
This Standard Operating Procedure should be reviewed and updated
annually or when significant changes in the procedure, reagents, or
equipment occur. All laboratory personnel must be trained on and
follow this SOP.
