Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for INTERLEUKIN 28B (IL28B) VARIANT
(RS12979860), VARIES
1. Purpose To provide a standardized protocol for the detection and
reporting of the Interleukin 28B (IL28B) variant (rs12979860) in
patient samples using molecular techniques. This protocol ensures
the accuracy and reliability of results, contributing to clinical decision-
making.
2. Scope This SOP applies to the molecular diagnostics laboratory
and covers the analytical phase of detecting IL28B variant
(rs12979860) in human genomic DNA samples.
3. Responsibility Designated laboratory personnel are responsible
for performing the procedures outlined in this SOP, including sample
preparation, assay setup, data analysis, and result reporting. The
laboratory supervisor is responsible for oversight and verification of
compliance with this SOP.
4. Equipment and Reagents
• PCR Thermal Cycler
• DNA Extraction Kit (e.g., Qiagen Blood & Tissue Kit)
• Primer sets specific to rs12979860
• Taq Polymerase
• dNTP mix
• PCR tubes
• Nuclease-free water
• Agarose gel electrophoresis setup
• Ethidium bromide or other DNA stains
• UV transilluminator
• Genotyping software
• Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS)
• Personal protective equipment (PPE)
5. Specimen Requirements
• Specimen type: Human whole blood
• Preferred/acceptable conditions: EDTA tubes collected and stored
at 2-8°C, processed (DNA extraction) within 48 hours of
collection.
• Unacceptable conditions: Hemolyzed samples, samples with
improper storage or without label.
6. Procedure 6.1 DNA Extraction
1. Take 200 µL of whole blood.
2. Extract DNA using a commercial DNA extraction kit following
the manufacturer’s instructions.
3. Quantify and assess the purity of the DNA using a
spectrophotometer.
4. Store extracted DNA at -20°C until use.
6.2 PCR Amplification
1. Prepare the PCR master mix:
◦ 10 µL buffer (10X)
◦ 1 µL dNTP mix (10mM each)
◦ 2 µL of each primer (forward and reverse, 10 µM)
◦ 0.5 µL Taq polymerase (5U/µL)
◦ 33.5 µL nuclease-free water
◦ 1 µL template DNA (20-50 ng/µL)
2. Mix gently and aliquot 48 µL into PCR tubes.
3. Run PCR on the thermal cycler under the following conditions:
◦ Initial denaturation: 95°C for 5 minutes
◦ 35 cycles of:
▪ Denaturation: 95°C for 30 seconds
▪ Annealing: 58-60°C for 30 seconds
▪ Extension: 72°C for 45 seconds
◦ Final extension: 72°C for 10 minutes
4. Verify amplification through agarose gel electrophoresis.
6.3 Detection of IL28B Variant
1. Perform restriction digest or sequence-specific PCR to
distinguish rs12979860 variants.
2. Run samples through agarose gel electrophoresis to visualize
the digested products or PCR product sizes using ethidium
bromide staining.
3. Image the gel using a UV transilluminator.
7. Data Analysis
1. Analyze electrophoresis images and map band patterns to
determine alleles.
2. Document findings using genotyping software.
3. Interpret results according to validated allele-specific criteria.
8. Quality Control
1. Include negative controls (no template DNA) and positive
controls (known variant genotype) in each PCR run.
2. Keep detailed records of all reagents, batch numbers, and
instruments used.
3. Ensure all equipment is calibrated and maintained according to
manufacturer specifications.
4. Conduct inter-laboratory comparisons periodically to validate
assay performance.
9. Reporting Results
1. Document all findings in LIMS.
2. Review and verify results by a certified technologist.
3. Report genotype (CC, CT, TT) to the clinician using designated
templates.
4. Provide interpretation regarding the clinical significance of the
identified variant.
10. References
• Manufacturer’s instructions for DNA extraction kit.
• Primer design references and validation protocols.
• Literature references on IL28B variant and its clinical implications.
• Relevant molecular diagnostics procedures and best practice
guidelines.
11. Safety Follow all laboratory safety protocols including the use of
PPE, proper handling and disposal of biohazardous materials, and
reporting any incidents to the supervisor immediately.
12. Troubleshooting Consult the supervisor or relevant literature in
case of non-conforming results, equipment malfunction, or
unexpected observations.
Approval and Review This SOP is reviewed annually and updated
as necessary to incorporate the latest research findings and
technological advances.
