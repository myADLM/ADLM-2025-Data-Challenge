Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for Interleukin-5 (IL-5) in Plasma
1. PURPOSE
To outline the procedure for the measurement of interleukin-5 (IL-5)
concentrations in plasma specimens using enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
Responsibility: Designated laboratory personnel are responsible for
performing the IL-5 assay, ensuring adherence to the SOP,
documenting results, and following necessary quality control
procedures.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS AND STABILITY
Specimen Type:
• Acceptable: Plasma collected in EDTA or heparinized tubes.
• Unacceptable: Serum or plasma collected in other anticoagulants,
specimens received in improper containers, visibly hemolyzed,
lipemic or icteric samples.
Specimen Collection:
• Plasma should be separated from whole blood within 2 hours of
collection.
• Centrifuge the blood samples at 1500-2000 g for 10 minutes at
4°C.
• Transfer the plasma to a clean polypropylene tube ensuring no
cellular material is transferred.
• Specimens must be stored at -70°C if not analyzed immediately.
Samples are stable for up to 6 months when stored at -70°C.
1. MATERIALS, REAGENTS, AND EQUIPMENT
Materials:
• Polypropylene tubes
• Pipette tips (sterile, disposable)
• Micropipettes
• Vortex mixer
• Centrifuge
• ELISA plate reader (450 nm filter)
Reagents:
• IL-5 ELISA kits (specific manufacturer)
• Calibrators and controls for IL-5 (as provided by the ELISA kit)
Equipment:
• ELISA washer
• Refrigerator
• Freezer (-70°C)
• Incubator
1. PROCEDURE
Preparation:
• Before starting, bring all reagents, samples, and ELISA plate to
room temperature (20-25°C) for 30 minutes.
• Prepare reagents as indicated in the manufacturer’s protocol.
Procedure:
1. Label the ELISA plate wells appropriately.
2. Add 50 µL of standard, sample, and control to the wells
(perform in duplicates or triplicates as necessary).
3. Add 50 µL of the assay buffer to each well.
4. Incubate the plate at room temperature for 2 hours with gentle
shaking.
5. Aspirate the contents of the wells and wash the plate 5 times
with the wash buffer using an ELISA washer.
6. Add 100 µL of conjugate reagent to each well.
7. Incubate at room temperature for 1 hour with gentle shaking.
8. Wash the plate 5 times with the wash buffer.
9. Add 100 µL of substrate solution to each well.
10. Incubate the plate in the dark at room temperature for 30
minutes.
11. Add 100 µL of stop solution to each well.
12. Read the plate at 450 nm using the ELISA plate reader within
15 minutes of adding the stop solution.
13. QUALITY CONTROL
Internal QC:
• Analyze at least one high and one low control with each batch of
patient samples.
External QC:
• Participate in external proficiency testing periodically (e.g.,
quarterly).
Acceptance Criteria:
• Control values must be within the manufacturer’s specified range
for the assay.
• If controls are out of range, review the procedure, recalibrate
equipment if necessary, and repeat the assay.
1. CALCULATION AND REPORTING RESULTS
Calculation:
• Use the standard curve generated by the ELISA reader software
to determine the IL-5 concentrations in the plasma samples.
• Apply any necessary dilutions to calculate the final concentration
of IL-5 in the specimen.
Reporting:
• Record results in the laboratory information system (LIS).
• Ensure data is reviewed and verified by the responsible
technologist.
• Flag any critical values and follow the protocol for notifying the
appropriate medical personnel.
1. METHOD LIMITATIONS
Limitations:
• Hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples can cause interference
with the assay results.
• Improper storage of samples can lead to degradation of IL-5.
