Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for INTRINSIC
FACTOR BLOCKING ANTIBODY, SERUM
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this SOP is to provide a standardized procedure for
the analysis and reporting of Intrinsic Factor Blocking Antibody (IFBA)
in serum samples. This ensures accurate, reliable, and reproducible
results.
2. SCOPE
This procedure applies to all clinical laboratory personnel performing
the Intrinsic Factor Blocking Antibody, Serum assay.
3. RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of all trained laboratory personnel to perform
this assay as per the detailed instructions within this SOP.
Supervisors must ensure all personnel are adequately trained.
4. EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS
4.1 Equipment:
• ELISA reader with appropriate wavelength filters
• Microplate washer
• Micropipettes and pipette tips
• Centrifuge
• Vortex mixer
• Refrigerator and freezer
• Calibrated traceable thermometer
4.2 Reagents and Supplies:
• Commercially available ELISA kit for Intrinsic Factor Blocking
Antibody, Serum
• Calibrators and controls (low, medium, high)
• Dilution buffers
• Washing buffer
• Substrate solution
• Stop solution
• Serum collection tubes (without anticoagulants, preferably SST
tubes)
5. PROCEDURE
5.1 Specimen Requirements:
• Collect blood specimens using standard phlebotomy techniques.
• Preferred: Freshly collected serum separated from the clot as
soon as possible.
• Store specimen at 2-8°C if not tested within 24 hours. For longer
storage, freeze at -20°C or lower.
5.2 Reagent Preparation:
• Bring all reagents and samples to room temperature before use.
• Prepare all reagents as per manufacturer's instructions.
5.3 Calibration and Quality Control:
• Run calibrators and quality controls (QC) with each batch of
patient samples.
• Ensure all calibrators and QC materials are within the expiration
date and properly stored.
• Include at least one negative control and one positive control in
each assay run.
5.4 Assay Procedure:
1. Label the microplate wells for standard, controls, and patient
samples.
2. Add the specified volume of standards, controls, and patient
serum samples to the appropriate wells.
3. Add the binding reagent to each well.
4. Incubate the plate for the time and temperature specified in the
kit instructions.
5. Wash the microplate wells as directed in the kit instructions.
6. Add substrate solution to each well.
7. Incubate the plate in the dark for the specified time to develop
color.
8. Add stop solution to each well.
9. Read the absorbance of each well at the specified wavelength
using an ELISA reader.
5.5 Result Calculation:
• Use the calibration curve generated from the standards to
calculate the concentration of IFBA in patient samples.
• Ensure the results for the controls fall within the acceptable
validation ranges before reporting patient results.
6. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
• Negative: Below the assay cut-off value.
• Positive: Above the assay cut-off value.
Refer to the kit insert for specific interpretation of results relative to
cut-off values.
7. REPORTING RESULTS
• All patient results and QC data must be reviewed by the
technologist.
• Enter results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS)
following site-specific reporting guidelines.
• All critical and unusual results should be verified and
communicated to the appropriate clinician as per protocol.
8. QUALITY CONTROL AND TROUBLESHOOTING
• Regularly perform instrument maintenance and calibrations as
directed.
• If any control falls outside the recommended range, do not report
patient results until the issue has been resolved.
• Document any deviations, corrective actions, and maintenance
performed during the assay.
