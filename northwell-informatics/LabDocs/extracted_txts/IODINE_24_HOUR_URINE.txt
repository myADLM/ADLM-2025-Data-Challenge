Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Analytical Phase of
Generating Results for IODINE, 24 HOUR, URINE
1. PURPOSE
To outline the methodology for the accurate and reproducible
analysis of iodine in 24-hour urine samples, ensuring consistency
and reliability in test results.
Responsibility:
It is the responsibility of trained laboratory personnel to conduct the
analysis following this protocol. Supervisors are responsible for
overseeing the process and ensuring compliance with the SOP.
1. SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS
Preferred/Acceptable:
• 24-hour urine collection in an acid-washed, clean, plastic
container. Containers should be free of any iodine-containing
disinfectants or contaminants.
• Collection should be refrigerated or stored in a cool dark place
during the collection period.
Unacceptable:
• Specimens not kept refrigerated during collection.
• Samples that are diluted, contaminated, or improperly collected.
• Specimens not accurately labeled with collection start and end
times.
Specimen Stability:
• Urine stable at 2-8°C for up to 72 hours.
• For longer storage, freeze at -20°C or lower.
1. EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SUPPLIES
• Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer (ICP-MS) or
equivalent analytical instrument.
• Acid-washed plastic containers for sample collection and storage.
• Deionized water.
• Calibrated pipettes and tips.
• Trace metal grade nitric acid.
• Internal standards (e.g., Tellurium).
• Certified reference materials for iodine.
1. PROCEDURE
A. Sample Preparation:
1. Ensure sample is well mixed before analysis.
2. Aliquot a portion of the urine sample into a clean, acid-washed
polypropylene tube.
3. Dilute urine sample 1:5 with deionized water containing a
known concentration of internal standard.
4. Add an appropriate amount of trace metal grade nitric acid to
stabilize the sample and ensure complete dissolution of iodine.
B. Calibration and Quality Control:
1. Prepare a series of iodine calibration standards covering the
expected concentration range in urine.
2. Run calibration standards and internal standards according to
manufacturer’s instructions to construct a calibration curve.
3. Include certified reference materials and quality control samples
in each analytical batch.
4. Perform calibration verification and quality control checks
periodically throughout the analysis.
C. Instrument Setup and Analysis:
1. Set up the ICP-MS instrument according to manufacturer
specifications, including optimization of gas flows, ion lenses,
and detector settings.
2. Upload the calibration curve and sample sequence into the
instrument software.
3. Introduce diluted urine samples, calibration standards, and QC
samples into the ICP-MS using an autosampler.
4. Record and monitor the instrument’s performance and stability
during the run.
D. Data Analysis and Reporting:
1. Analyze the raw data using the ICP-MS software, applying
appropriate corrections for matrix effects and instrument drift.
2. Calculate the iodine concentration in urine samples using the
calibration curve and internal standard normalization.
3. Review all calibration and QC data to ensure accuracy and
precision of results.
Reference Intervals:
• Iodine concentration: 100-200 µg/L (check for lab-specific
reference intervals).
Critical Results:
• Critical values that indicate iodine deficiency or excessive iodine
exposure.
E. Quality Control and Validations:
1. Perform daily instrument validation checks, including sensitivity
and precision.
2. Validate new batches of reagents, internal standards, and
certified reference materials against known standards.
3. Document all quality control and validation runs, and take
immediate corrective actions if results deviate from acceptable
limits.
4. REPORTING RESULTS
5. Review all generated data for compliance with quality control
standards and laboratory regulations.
6. Report the results into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
7. Flag and document any critical values, inaccuracies, or
interferences that might affect patient care.
